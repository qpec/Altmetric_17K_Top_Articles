In Brief
Paolicelli et al. show that TDP-43 is a
regulator of microglial phagocytosis.
They found that mice lacking microglial
TDP-43 display enhanced amyloid
clearance but also significant synapse
loss. They also show that TDP-43
pathology is associated with reduced
amyloid burden in human brains.

SUMMARY
Microglia coordinate various functions in the central
nervous system ranging from removing synaptic
connections, to maintaining brain homeostasis by
monitoring neuronal function, and clearing protein
aggregates across the lifespan. Here we investigated
whether increased microglial phagocytic activity that
clears amyloid can also cause pathological synapse
loss. We identified TDP-43, a DNA-RNA binding pro-
tein encoded by the Tardbp gene, as a strong regu-
lator of microglial phagocytosis. Mice lacking TDP-
43 in microglia exhibit reduced amyloid load in a
model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but at the same
time display drastic synapse loss, even in the
absence of amyloid. Clinical examination from TDP-
43 pathology cases reveal a considerably reduced
prevalence of AD and decreased amyloid pathology
compared to age-matched healthy controls, confirm-
ing our experimental results. Overall, our data sug-
gest that dysfunctional microglia might play a causa-
tive role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative
disorders, critically modulating the early stages of
cognitive decline.
INTRODUCTION
Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system
(CNS), provide constant surveillance for neural functioning (Nim-
merjahn et al., 2005; Davalos et al., 2005). They coordinate
various critical roles throughout life, assisting early neuronal
development and circuit formation and maintaining brain ho-
meostasis (Paolicelli and Gross, 2011; Tremblay et al., 2011;
Kettenmann et al., 2013). As the primary source of phagocytes
in the CNS, microglia engulf cellular debris upon programmed
apoptosis, remove excess synapses during neural circuit matu-
ration, and clear the brain from potentially dangerous protein
aggregates (Wakselman et al., 2008; Sierra et al., 2010; Lee
and Landreth, 2010; Paolicelli et al., 2011; Prinz et al., 2011).
Synapse elimination is activity dependent and strictly confined
to the first postnatal weeks in the rodent brain, a physiological
process defined as synaptic pruning (Paolicelli et al., 2011;
Schafer et al., 2012). However, recent studies indicate that this
process re-activates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), in which amy-
loid promotes microglia-mediated removal of synapses (Hong
et al., 2016). Synaptic loss, an early and highly predictive corre-
late of cognitive decline (Terry et al., 1991), occurs not only in AD
but also in other distinct neurodegenerative disorders character-
ized by the presence of toxic protein aggregates. This accumu-
lation classifies these disorders as proteinopathies.
Evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) re-
veals that most genes associated with risk to develop such disor-
ders are highly expressed in microglia, which implies that they
could modulate immune and phagocytic functions in disease
states (Derecki et al., 2014). This hypothesis suggests that they
may confer susceptibility to develop the diseases by modulating
microglia-mediated protein aggregates clearance rather than
production. We previously demonstrated that risk genes associ-
ated with late-onset AD do not affect amyloid production,
which suggests that these predisposinggenetic factors contribute
to disease development through different mechanisms (Bali et al.,
2012). These data implicate microglia in the pathogenesis
of neurodegenerative disorders. However, it remains unknown
whether an intrinsic dysfunction in microglia can promote patho-
logical synaptic pruning leading to abnormal synapse loss.

 intracellularly through enzymatic degradation following phago-
cytosis or extracellularly through degradation by secreted en-
zymes (Vekrellis et al., 2000; Nakanishi, 2003; Ries and Sastre,
2016; Sole
´ -Dome
` nech et al., 2016). We selected 18 top-ranked
genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases and, using
a loss-of-function approach, we screened them for their role to
modulate microglial clearance of beta amyloid (Ab), a well-estab-
lished target for microglial phagocytosis and degradation (Par-
esce et al., 1996; Frenkel et al., 2013). Among the candidates
we tested, TDP-43 exhibited the strongest Ab clearance in BV2
cells, i.e., residual Ab peptide levels measured from medium
containing endogenous murine Ab showed a significant reduc-
tion after exposure to cells in which TDP-43 gene was knocked
down (Figures S1A–S1D).
TDP-43 is a 43 kDa DNA-RNA binding protein encoded by the
Tardbp gene and is a known transcriptional repressor, mRNA
binding protein, and splicing factor (Buratti and Baralle, 2001; La-
gier-Tourenne et al., 2010; Polymenidou et al., 2011; Baralle et al.,
2013). Ubiquinated TDP-43 aggregates represent the predomi-
nant constituent of cytoplasmic inclusions in glia and neurons
in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, who show severe neuronal loss
in frontal or motor cortex, respectively (Neumann et al., 2006).
In the last years, the number of neurodegenerative disorders
associated with TDP-43 pathology has considerably increased
(Cook et al., 2008; Buratti and Baralle, 2009). The accompanying
cell death in these disorders may arise from a combination of a
toxic gain of function and a loss of nuclear TDP-43, both of which
are associated with the presence of cytoplasmic aggregates (Co-
hen et al., 2011; Gendron and Petrucelli, 2011). Although a gain of
toxicity induced by cytoplasmic inclusions can significantly
contribute to the pathology (Xu et al., 2011; Medina et al., 2014;
Walker et al., 2015), TDP-43 loss of function in neurons has
been shown to be sufficient for inducing neuronal loss, accompa-
nied by neuropathological alterations (Kraemer et al., 2010; Wu
et al., 2012; Iguchi et al., 2013; Vanden Broeck et al., 2013). How-
ever, no evidence so far existed to support a role for loss of TDP-
43 in microglia in the pathogenesis of the disease.
We wanted to confirm whether the enhanced clearance
observed upon Tardbp knockdown could be also replicated
with human Ab. To this end, TDP-43-depleted BV2 cells were
incubated overnight with conditioned medium derived from
HeLa cells overexpressing the Swedish mutation of the human
Amyloid Precursor Protein (sweAPP). This assay ensured that
BV2 cells were exposed to medium containing high levels of hu-
man Ab. Consistent with our findings from the murine Ab screen,
TDP-43 depletion resulted in a higher clearance capacity of all
the Ab species measured, compared to a scrambled control
(Figure 1A). We achieved efficient TDP-43 depletion using either
siRNA pools or single oligos (Figure 1B), with consistent results
on amyloid clearance (Figure S1E).
To determine whether enhanced phagocytosis was the mech-
anism that mediated this enhanced clearance, we measured the
internalization of fluorescently labeled Ab peptide, a cargo previ-
ously reported to be phagocytosed by microglia (Paresce et al.,
1996). In a validation experiment, the internalization of the Ab
peptide was followed in time lapse with the pH-dependent Lyso-
Tracker dye, to ensure that the cargo was trafficked to intracel-
lular acidic compartments (Movie S1; Figurea S2A and S2B).
TDP-43 depletion significantly enhanced intracellular levels of
fluorescent Ab (Figures 1C and 1D). Consistent with the
enhanced uptake, we found a similar effect using fluorescently
labeled dextran (Figures 1E and 1F) and transferrin (Figures 1G
and 1H), which target uptake-mediated cargo. These results
indicate that TDP-43 depletion in microglia increases the overall
phagocytic activity.
Next, we determined whether the increased uptake was func-
tionally followed by enhanced intracellular degradation. For that,
we quantified the fluorescent signal of internalized Ab40 3 hr
after the uptake (T = 3 hr) and found a significant reduction in
intracellular fluorescence, despite a higher uptake as measured
by the initial amount (T = 0 hr) (Figures 1I and 1J). Since TDP-43
depletion increased intracellular degradation and amyloid is
sorted to the lysosomal compartment for degradation in micro-
glia (Cole et al., 1992), we examined whether increased lyso-
somal function occurs after TDP-43 depletion. We found higher
levels of acidic late endosomal/lysosomal structures indicated
by the pH-sensitive LysoTracker staining (Figures 1K and 1L).
In addition, increased levels of lysosomal markers, such as
LAMP1 and LAMP2, also accompanied the increased changes
in acidic organelles in both BV2 cells (Figure 1M) and primary mi-
croglia cultures depleted of TDP-43 (Figures S3A–S3C). TDP-43
loss was recently shown to promote the nuclear translocation of
TFEB, a transcription factor regulating lysosomal biogenesis (Xia
et al., 2016). To investigate whether this was the case in microglia
cells depleted of TDP-43, we assessed a subset of CLEAR (co-
ordinated lysosomal expression and regulation) genes tran-
scripts, downstream of TFEB, by RT-PCR. We found that the
expression of Lamp1, CtsD, CtsB, Clcn7, vATP6v1h, Psap, and
Psen2 in TDP-43-depleted cells was higher than in scrambled
control (Figure S3D). Overall, these data identify and validate
TDP-43 as a regulator of microglial phagocytosis and clearance
of Ab.

Promotes Phagocytosis of Stereotactically Injected Ab
We then determined the physiological relevance of these
findings in vivo by generating a microglial-specific inducible
conditional TDP-43 knockout mouse line (cKO). We crossed

 Tardbpfloxed mice (Chiang et al., 2010) (Figure 2A). We confirmed
that Tardbp transcript levels were significantly downregulated
specifically in microglia isolated from cKO mice upon tamoxifen
administration compared to WT controls, whereas overall cor-
tical levels remained unchanged (Figures S4A and S4B). In addi-
tion, nuclear TDP-43 depletion was also confirmed at the protein
level, in CRE-treated microglial primary cultures prepared from
Tardbpfloxed mice (Figures S4C and S4D).
We then confirmed enhanced phagocytic uptake upon TDP-
43 depletion in vivo by injecting Ab42 oligomers in the cortex
(100 mM, as prepared in Fa et al., 2010) and quantifying amyloid
uptake 24 hr later (Figures 2B–2E). Interestingly, we observed a
significant increase of microglia cells in close proximity to the
amyloid core in cKO mice compared to WT littermates, whereas
no differences occurred in the area surrounding the Ab core
(Figures 2D and 2F).

 Conditional Depletion of Microglial TDP-43 Enhances
Amyloid Clearance but Also Exacerbates Synaptic Loss
in a Mouse Model of AD
In the light of all our findings indicating that TDP-43 depletion in
microglia enhances the phagocytic uptake of Ab, we hypothe-
sized that this would promote clearance to reduce the total
amyloid burden in a mouse model of AD. To this end, we
crossed our Cx3cr1CreER;Tardbpfloxed mice with mice overex-
pressing human APP carrying the Arctic and Swedish mutations
(APParc, Knobloch et al., 2007). Again, in this mouse model of
AD, Ab levels measurement revealed a significant reduction in
cKO;APParc compared to WT;APParc littermates (Figure 3A) in
the SDS fraction of brain homogenates and showed a similar
trend in the TBS fraction (Figures S5A and S5B), confirming
our in vitro results that TDP-43 depletion in microglia enhanced
Ab clearance. We found no differences in sAPPb levels, a soluble
intermediate product in the generation of Ab, indicating that
the amyloidogenic processing of APP was not affected, as also
suggested by comparable levels of the full-length APP (Fig-
ure 3A; Figures S5A and S5C). These results definitely show

 that TDP-43 depletion in microglia promotes Ab clearance,
rather than affecting production.
To investigate whether the enhanced Ab clearance had any
bearing on the amyloid load, we performed ThioS staining and
observed a significant reduction in the cortex of cKO;APParc
mice compared to WT (Figures 3B–3D), with no change in plaque
size (Figure S5D). Levels of Iba1 and CD45 markers in microglia
surrounding the plaques were comparable in cKO and WT con-
trols (Figures S5E–S5G).
Since amyloid oligomers and plaques are considered the pri-
mary cause of synaptotoxicity in AD patients, we hypothesized
that enhancing microglial-mediated amyloid clearance should
preserve synapses. To our surprise, despite the reduction in
amyloid load, we found a significant decrease in cortical synaptic
markers in these mice as assayed by western blot (Figure 3E).
Specifically, PSD95, a scaffold protein located in dendritic
spines, was significantly reduced (Figure 3F), while levels of
MAP2, a dendritic structural protein, were comparable between
WT and cKO mice. These results suggest a specific reduction in
dendritic spines rather than a general decrease in neuronal
branches (Figure 3G). Consistently, levels of synapsin and syn-
aptophysin were also reduced (Figures 3H and 3I). In addition,
quantification of immunoreactive puncta for the synaptic marker
vGlut1 also confirmed a drastic reduction in glutamatergic
terminals (Figures 3J and 3K). These data show that microglia
lacking TDP-43 can mediate enhanced removal and clearance
of amyloid in an AD mouse model, but also in parallel, induce
significant synapse loss. Overall these findings suggest that
abnormally phagocytic microglia remove not only amyloid but
also synapses.
In Vivo Depletion of TDP-43 from Microglia Results in
Enhanced Synapse Loss Even in the Absence of Amyloid
Microglia are shown to re-activate synaptic pruning in the pres-
ence of Ab oligomers (Hong et al., 2016). Since we observed
synapse loss in mice depleted of microglial TDP-43 in APP trans-
genic model, we next asked whether amyloid is required for the
synapse loss to occur.
To answer this question, we quantified the levels of synaptic
markers in the cortex of WT and cKO mice where no human
APP gene was overexpressed and thus no amyloid load was pre-
sent. Here again, we found a significant decrease in vGlut1 and
PSD95 (Figures 4A–4C). Since demyelination can occur in many
neurodegenerative disorders, we also assayed levels of myelin-
binding protein (MBP) isoforms and found a significant decrease
(Figures 4A and 4D). The decrease in PSD95 was significant
despite no changes in MAP2 levels, indicative of a selective syn-
apse loss rather than general neuronal death (Figures 4A and 4E).
Consistent with these findings, we observed a significant
decrease in cortical dendritic spine density in cKO mice (Figures
4F and 4G). vGlut1 immunohistochemistry also revealed a signif-
icant decrease in mice depleted of microglial TDP-43 compared
to controls (Figures 4H and 4I). These results conclusively show
that synapse loss occurs due to microglial TDP-43 depletion in
mice, independent of amyloid load.
To directly assess the role of microglia in synapse elimination
in these mice, we quantified synapse engulfment through 3D
reconstruction of confocal acquisitions. Since we observed syn-
aptic immunoreactive puncta within CD68-positive phagocytic
structures inside microglia cells (Figure S6), our signal co-local-
ization was specific. We then quantified PSD95 immunoreactive
puncta within and surrounding microglia cells. There was a sig-
nificant increase in the fraction of synaptic marker engulfed by
TDP-43 depleted microglia compared to WT controls (Figures
4J and 4K). We also observed a significant increase in the phago-
cytic marker CD68 (Figure 4L). The cells had increased size and
total volume of CD68-positive structures, despite no change in
number of structures (Figures 4M–4O). Overall, these data
show that abnormal microglial phagocytosis induced by TDP-
43 depletion mediates synapse loss, regardless of the presence
of amyloid.
TDP-43 Pathology Is Associated with Lower Prevalence
of AD and Higher Microglial Phagocytic Markers in Post-
mortem Human Brains
In line with our findings, we predicted that enhanced microglia-
mediated clearance would affect cognitive decline by targeting
synapses yet simultaneously reducing amyloid plaque load.
This dual function could complicate the diagnosis of AD, which
has been a topic of discussion for a very long time—whether am-
yloid load correlates with the cognitive decline (Braak and Braak,
1998; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011; Nelson et al., 2012). We evalu-
ated the prevalence of AD in a large cohort (n = 698) of ALS pa-
tients that typically exhibit TDP-43 pathology (Table S1). We
selected an age cutoff of 65 years or older, as individuals over
the age of 65 are at increased risk of sporadic AD. The preva-
lence of AD in ALS patients aged 65 to 74 years was comparable
to what is expected in the normal population (reference to Hebert
et al., 2013); however, the AD prevalence was considerably
lower in ALS patients aged 75 years and above (Figure 5A).
Notably,
cognitive
evaluation
revealed
a subtle
cognitive
dysfunction in non-AD ALS patients older than 75 years, despite
excluding patients with over-lapping FTLD (Figure 5B). These
findings suggest that TDP-43 pathology is associated with
reduced amyloid burden and may underlie subtle cognitive def-
icits in non-AD ALS patients. These clinical data support our
overall hypothesis that dysfunctional microglia (as due to TDP-
43 pathology) can mediate both enhanced amyloid clearance
and synapse loss. This suggests that TDP-43 pathology might
promote neurodegeneration through synapse loss on one
hand, but on the other might also reduce the risk for enhancing
the amyloid load and thus decrease the prevalence of AD.
To verify that the observed decreased prevalence of AD in ALS
patients is secondary to decreased amyloid burden, we quanti-
fied amyloid pathology in an independent brain autopsy cohort,
composed of healthy controls, AD cases, and TDP-43 cases
(ALS and FTLD-TDP-43). The quantification of Ab was performed
using Thal Ab phase (TAP) scoring system. TAP relies on immu-
nohistochemistry and evaluates presence or absence of all Ab
plaques spatially across several neocortical, limbic, and sub-
cortical regions of the brain. TAP staging is superior to other
methods of Ab quantification in its sensitivity for Ab, as well as
prediction of dementia symptoms (Boluda et al., 2014). Using
TAP scoring, we observed Ab plaque burden to be comparable
to age-matched controls in 65- to 74-year-old ALS/FTLD-TDP
patients. However, similar to how AD prevalence was lower in
302
Neuron 95, 297–308, July 19, 2017
 ALS patients who were 75 years or older, Ab pathology was
significantly reduced in the brains collected from ALS/FTLD-
TDP patients 75 years or older, compared to the age-matched
controls (Figures 5C and 5D). These findings suggest that
TDP-43 pathology might promote enhanced amyloid clearance
and hence prevent against AD.
To further validate the increase in the microglial phagocytic
marker CD68 observed in our mouse model, we examined an

 independent brain autopsy cohort. To this end, we tested the
levels of cortical CD68 in the context of ALS pathology. Impor-
tantly, we found that CD68 burden was significantly higher in
ALS patients with TDP-43 pathology as compared to ALS pa-
tients without TDP-43 inclusions, or to healthy controls (Figures
5E and 5F; Table S2), supporting a critical role for TDP-43 in
regulating microglial function. Finally, to assess the clinical rele-
vance of the described microglial phenotype, we investigated
whether TDP-43 aggregates could be found in the microglia of
TDP-43 pathology cases. To this aim, we analyzed eight motor
neurodegenerative (MND) cases with TDP-43 pathology and
four healthy controls. In the MND cases, but not in the controls,
we could observe examples of cytoplasmic inclusions positively
stained for phospho-TDP-43 (pTDP-43) within microglial cells
positive for Iba1 (Figure 5G), indicating that microglial TDP-43
can contribute to TDP-43 pathology. Importantly, though rare,
pTDP-43 inclusions in microglia were found in all of the MND
cases examined. Overall these findings corroborate the clinical
relevance for a dysfunctional, abnormally phagocytic microglial
phenotype in TDP-43 pathology.
DISCUSSION
Here we show that loss of TDP-43 in microglia enhances phago-
cytosis and amyloid clearance following acute Ab oligomers in-
jection and in a mouse model of AD. The abnormal phagocytosis
induced by loss of TDP-43 concurrently resulted in an excessive
loss of synapses independent of amyloid deposition. Our data
demonstrate enhanced lysosomal function following TDP-43
depletion. However, further studies are now required to identify
the exact mechanism through which TDP-43 regulates lysosome
biogenesis and also enhanced phagocytosis. One possibility is
that TDP-43 negatively controls lysosomal biogenesis genes
such as the CLEAR genes that are regulated by the transcription
factor TFEB. In this study, we found that TDP-43 depletion re-
sults in the increase transcription of genes related to lysosomal
biogenesis; however, we focused only on a selected set of
CLEAR genes. Whether TDP-43 regulates lysosome biogenesis
through
the
entire
CLEAR
gene
network
needs
to
be
further elucidated. Alternatively TDP-43 could also regulate
mTOR activity, which in turn regulates lysosome biogenesis via
the Raptor-TSC2-TFEB-lysosome/autophagosome biogenesis.
Recent study performed in HeLa cells showed that TDP-43
loss promotes autophagosomal biogenesis as a direct conse-
quence of decreased Raptor mRNA stability and promotes
nuclear translocation of TFEB, a transcription factor master
regulator of lysosomal genes (Ying et al., 2016). Our findings sug-
gest that TDP-43 depletion positively regulates lysosomal genes
downstream of TFEB. However, it remains to be tested whether
TDP-43 loss leads to decreased Raptor mRNA and regulation of
mTOR activity in microglia cells.
TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions can occur in multiple neurode-
generative diseases, which are collectively defined as TDP-
43 proteinopathies. This classification highlights a key role for
TDP-43 in the disease pathogenesis (Cohen et al., 2011). Previ-
ous studies indicate a causal role for TDP-43 neuronal pathology
in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and synaptic loss
using animal models of disease. These studies suggest, in fact,
a cell-autonomous TDP-43 neurotoxicity (Igaz et al., 2011; Xu
et al., 2011; Diaper et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014; Medina
et al., 2014; Handley et al., 2016).
Recent studies revealed additional non-autonomous functions
for TDP-43 pathology in Drosophila glia, which result in defective
synapses and axonal wrapping of motor neurons (Romano et al.,
2015). However, neither a direct demonstration of microglial
TDP-43 function nor its direct contribution to the pathological
phenotype has been yet proposed. Here we provide evidence
that phosphorylated TDP-43 aggregates can be found in the mi-
croglia of human post-mortem brains with TDP-43 pathology,
thus opening the possibility that microglial TDP-43 might
contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.
In our model, a microglial-specific dysfunction induced by
a loss of TDP-43 mediates a non-cell-autonomous neurotoxic
effect, which could sum to other cellular phenotypes and criti-
cally contribute to the disorder. However, we cannot exclude
the involvement of other Cx3cr1-positive non-parenchymal
myeloid cells, considering that Cx3cr1-driven recombination
also occurs in perivascular and meningeal macrophages (Gold-
mann et al., 2016).
Our data show that abnormal phagocytosis and clearance
elicited in microglia following TDP-43 loss is ultimately paradox-
ical. These processes are not entirely beneficial in the context of
a complex organism, since microglial phagocytic activity might
not only enable clearance of protein aggregates but also synap-
tic connection loss. These mixed responses may underlie the
failure of many AD drug treatment clinical trials to improve cogni-
tive function, despite the progressive reductions in amyloid
burden.
Synaptic pruning by microglia can re-activate in the presence
of Ab oligomers, since complement molecules upregulate in the
disease state to ultimately mediate synapse removal (Hong et al.,
2016). Here we show that an intrinsic dysregulation of microglia
induced by TDP-43 depletion is sufficient to trigger abnormal
synapse loss, even in the absence of Ab oligomers. Our results
further suggest that microglial dysfunction underlies the patho-
genesis of many disparate and distinct neurodegenerative
disorders. In line with our results, a recent study reported that se-
lective neuronal depletion of TDP-43 was sufficient to reduce
amyloid burden and to exacerbate cognitive deficits in an AD
mouse model, suggesting that common mechanisms induced
by loss of TDP-43 may partially explain the enhanced amyloid
clearance (LaClair et al., 2016).

 Consistent with our experimental findings, we show that the
prevalence of AD was considerably reduced in a cohort of ALS
patients when compared to the expected AD prevalence in the
normal population. Nevertheless, these ALS patients without
AD still exhibited a subtle decline in cognitive function, which
suggests an underlying loss of synapses. Importantly, neuro-
pathological examination of post-mortem human brains showed
a significant reduction of amyloid burden in ALS/FTLD-TDP-43
cases, as compared to age-matched healthy controls. These
findings suggest that TDP-43 pathology might lead to enhanced
Ab clearance and hence delay AD. However, in the same data-
set, a comparison of Ab levels within AD cases with or without
TDP-43 pathology did not reveal any major difference. This
observation could suggest that the enhanced clearance through
TDP-43 pathology might modulate the initial stages of amyloid
deposition, but have no effects once the amyloid burden has
established. Further studies are required to better elucidate the
correlation between AD and TDP-43 pathology.
Indeed, a recent study from a population-based sample re-
vealed a strong association of TDP-43 inclusions with late-onset
dementia, but not with AD markers of amyloid and tau (Keage
et al., 2014). Similarly, another study reported that the preva-
lence of amyloid positivity on PET in FTLD patients was lower
than healthy age-matched controls, further corroborating our
findings (Ossenkoppele et al., 2015). Furthermore, reduced am-
yloid pathology with concomitant exaggerated microglial CD68
levels and activation in TDP-43-positive ALS cases strongly
supports our hypothesis (as also observed in Brettschneider
et al., 2012).
Emerging evidence suggests that clearance mechanisms play
a crucial role in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in spo-
radic cases where no mutations may cause the disease. In addi-
tion, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified
a growing number of risk factors associated with microglial func-
tion. Certainly, identifying the pathways that underlie microglia-
induced pathological synaptic pruning is of foremost impor-
tance. These pathways could elucidate cellular mechanisms
common to the early stages of many distinct neurodegenerative
disorders and may also reveal new powerful and efficient thera-
peutic targets. We believe these interventions could selectively
target the paradoxical effects we discovered to prevent synapse
loss and cognitive decline.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animal studies
Cx3cr1tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Litt/WganJ and Tardbpfloxed/floxed mice, originally obtained from Jackson Labs, were maintained on a C57BL/
6J genetic background, and were intercrossed to produce the microglia-specific TDP-43 inducible conditional KO mouse line, cKO
(Parkhurst et al., 2013; Chiang et al., 2010). APParc (ArcAb transgenic) mice were produced in our department and maintained in our
breeding colony on a C57BL/6J genetic background, and were crossed to the cKO mouse line for studies in a mouse model of AD
(Knobloch et al., 2007). All the experimental subjects were obtained by crossing Cx3cr1creERT2/creERT2;Tardbpfloxed/wt with
Tardbpfloxed/wt, in order to produce littermates that were all heterozygous for Cx3cr1creERT2, and wild-type (WT) or homozygous
(cKO) for the Tardbpfloxed allele. Both males and females were used for the experiments, and cKO and WT controls were always paired
littermates, sex and age-matched. Importantly, all subjects underwent tamoxifen administration, to rule out any unspecific effect due
to the treatment. Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) was dissolved in corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich) and administered via i.p.
injections (2 mg/mouse/day for 5 consecutive days) when mice were 4 months old. To reduce bias in the study design, all the exper-
imental subjects were caged in groups and all underwent tamoxifen injections, to equally expose them to the effect of the treatment.
For spine density analysis, cKO mice were intercrossed to Thy1-EGFP-M mouse line (Feng et al., 2000). Mice were given ad libitum
access to food and water and were maintained group housed ona 12:12h light-dark cycle. For stereotactic injection experiments, mice
were sacrificed at 5 months. For all the other experiments, mice were sacrificed when they were 7 (APParc; cKO) or 8 months old (cKO).
All animal procedures were conducted with approval of the animal care and use committees of the Swiss Cantonal Veterinary Office.
Human studies
Clinical study
The study population was derived from 1818 consecutive ALS patients seen at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA
Neurology outpatient clinic between 1999 to 2008. All patients had diagnosis of clinically probable or possible ALS according to
the revised El Escorial criteria (Brooks, 1994). Patients under the age of 65 (n = 273), lacking neuropsychological assessment/AD
screening (n = 794), or with over-lapping FTD (n = 41), were excluded. Further exclusions (n = 12) were for patients with a history
of neurological conditions potentially impacting cognition, such as stroke, vitamin B12 deficiency, and severe traumatic brain injury.
In total, n = 698 patients were included in the study (aged 65-74 n = 530: ALS with AD n = 25, 48% male; ALS without AD n = 505,
59.8% male. Aged R 75 n = 168: ALS with AD n = 12, 83.3% male; ALS without AD n = 156, 48.7%, see details in Table S1). All
the selected patients had undergone comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological exams by physicians blinded to the cur-
rent study design at the time of assessment. The neuropsychological battery comprised tests for verbal and non-verbal memory,

 executive functioning, semantic fluency, and visuo-spatial functioning as previously described (Jawaid et al., 2010). Patients were
labeled with AD or FTD if their clinical and neuropsychological parameters corresponded to the National Institute of Non-communi-
cable Disorders and Stroke- Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINDS-ADRDA) criteria for probable or possible
AD (McKhann et al., 1984) or Neary’s criteria for FTD (Neary et al., 1998) respectively. Further details are reported in Table S1.
Informed written consent was obtained from all the patients. The study was approved by the Institutional review board (IRB) of Baylor
College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.
Human post-mortem study for amyloid detection
The autopsy cohort comprised, n = 35 ALS patients with clinical diagnosis of ALS in accordance with the modified El escorial criteria
with pathological confirmation of TDP-43 pathology, n = 25 FTLD patients with clinical diagnosis of FTD in accordance with the Neary
criteria with pathological confirmation of TDP-43 pathology, n = 40 controls who died of non-neurological causes and were negative
for TDP-43 pathology, n = 62 patients with clinically probable AD according to NINDS criteria with pathological confirmation of AD on
autopsy. The neuropathological diagnoses were established and documented at the Centre for Neurodegenerative Disease
Research (CNDR) at the University of Pennsylvania, USA. Informed written consent was obtained from all the patients or their
next of kin at the time of death. The autopsies were performed over the course of 22 years (1993-2015) and pathological findings,
as well as, clinically relevant information (gender, age of onset, site of onset, age at death, disease severity, etc.) were documented
in an integrated database described previously (Toledo et al., 2014).
Human post-mortem study for CD68 and pTDP-43-Iba1 detection
The autopsy cohort comprised n = 11 ALS cases TDP-43-negative (average age 66.8 ± 13.13; mean ± SD), n = 16 ALS cases TDP-43
positive (61.6 ± 10.2), and n = 6 healthy control (78.5 ± 0.8) who died of non-neurological causes and were negative for TDP-43 pa-
thology (for details, see Table S2. Informed written consent was obtained from all the patients or their next of kin at the time of death.
Use of human tissue for CD68 post-mortem studies has been reviewed and approved by the Edinburgh Brain Bank ethics committee
and the ACCORD medical research ethics committee, AMREC (ACCORD is the Academic and Clinical Central Office for Research
and Development, a joint office of the University of Edinburgh and NHS Lothian). The Edinburgh Brain Bank is a Medical Research
Council funded facility with research ethics committee (REC) approval (11/ES/0022).
METHODS DETAILS
Cell Culture
BV2 cells and HeLa cells expressing the APP Swedish mutation (HeLa swAPP) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, CA, USA), supple-
mented with 10% FCS and 100 U mL-1 penicillin/streptomycin, at 37�C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. In addition, HeLa swAPP
were supplemented with 0.1% G418 antibiotic (Carl Roth), and 0.1% Zeocin (Invitrogen). Primary microglial murine cell cultures were
prepared as described in Deierborg (2013). Briefly,mixed glia cultures were prepared fromnewborn Tardbpfloxed/floxed miceand cultured
in high glucose (4.5 mg/ml) DMEM + GlutaMax supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 U mL-1 penicillin/streptomycin. Microglial cells
were harvested by manual shake-off after 10-14 days of primary cultivation. The medium containing detached microglia was collected
and isolated microglia were reseeded on 96-well plates at a density of 4 3 104 cells/well at 37�C and 5% CO2. Cells were allowed to
settle for 24 hr before treatment. Tardbp gene deletion was induced in Tardbpfloxed/floxed primary microglia culture by recombinant
TAT-CRE treatment (100 U/ml medium, EMD Millipore). Control Tardbpfloxed/floxed cells were treated with a solution containing 50%
glycerol, 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.4.
Cells for immunohistochemistry were seeded onto glass coverslips in 96-well plates. Labeling of acidic organelles in BV2 and pri-
mary microglia was performed by incubating living cells, at 37�C and 5% CO2, for 90 min with 200 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99
fluorescent dye (Invitrogen).
siRNAs
All siRNAs were chemically synthesized as stealth RNAi from Invitrogen. A pool of four different siRNA per gene (1 scrambled control
plus 18 risk genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders) were transfected into BV2 murine cells, for the initial screen.
Validation of Tardbp knockdown was performed by using pool or single stealth siRNA oligos. Transfection complexes in technical
triplicates were prepared in Opti-mem serum-free medium (Invitrogen) by mixing Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and siRNAs
(50 nM). BV2 cells were seeded at density of 2,500 cells per well, 24 hr prior the transfection, on 96-well plates coated with poly-
D-lysin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Acute Isolation of Adult Microglia
Microglia from the brain of adult mice were acutely isolated according to slight modification of Cardona et al., 2006. Briefly, mice were
anaesthetized and perfused with saline solution. Brains were harvested and freed of meninges, then finely minced by scissors in
digestion cocktail containing 0.4 mg/ml CollagenaseD (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and 0.025U/ml DNaseI (Sigma) in HBSS.
The cell suspension was incubated for 45 min on shaking, at 37�C, then filtered through 70mm nylon mesh and washed in HBSS.
The pellet was resuspended in 37% isotonic Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich), then underlayed with 70% and overlayed with 30% iso-
tonic Percoll solution. The gradient was spun at 600 g for 30 min at 18�C and afterward the microglia were collected from the
70%–37% interface, washed in HBSS and further processed for RNA isolation.

e3
 RT-PCR was used to confirm efficient deletion of Tardbp from primary culture, acutely isolated microglia and whole mouse cortex,
and to assess the expression of TFEB-downstream genes in BV2 cells. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality and concentration were assessed by a NanoDrop device (Thermo Fisher). Reverse tran-
scription was performed by iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad), according to the manufacturer’s recommended instructions. RT-
PCR was performed on QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), by using iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad). Expression levels were compared using the DDCt method normalized to Gapdh.
Ab Clearance Assay and Cell Proliferation Assay
48 hr after siRNA transfection, BV2 microglia cells were incubated with murine primary neurons- or HeLa swAPP-conditioned
medium, and kept overnight at 37�C, 5% CO2. Medium was then collected upon 15 hr of incubation with cells, and used for
measurement of residual Ab. Cell viability was subsequently analyzed with Alamar Blue cell proliferation assay (AbD Serotec) using
a fluorescent plate reader (Tecan).
Ab measurement
96-well and 384-well MULTI-ARRAY Multiplex Kits (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) were used to measure the level
of Ab38, Ab40, Ab42 and sAPPb, by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay. Supernatants of BV2 cells after the Ab clearance assay
or brain homogenates TBS- and SDS-soluble fractions were further processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. sAPPb
and Ab species peptides were detected with a monoclonal antibody and quantified by using a SECTOR Imager 6000 reader (Meso
Scale Discovery). Values were normalized to scrambled control or to WT, for in vitro and in vivo experiments, respectively.
Phagocytosis and degradation of fluorescently labeled Ab
Microglial phagocytosis of fluorescently labeled amyloid (1mM, 647-Ab40, Anaspec), Dextran (1 mg/ml, Thermo Fisher) and Trans-
ferrin (30 mg/ml, Thermo Fisher) was quantified by confocal microscopy after incubation of BV2 cells at 37�C. At the indicated
time points, the Ab-containing medium was removed and cells were washed, fixed with PFA 4%, and incubated with DAPI (Thermo
Fisher) for staining the nuclei. For the degradation assay, BV2 cells were incubated for 1 hr with 1 mM TAMRA-Ab40; after medium
removal, cells were washed twice and were either immediately fixed with PFA 4% (T0), either fixed after 3 hr (T3h).
Western Blot and Brain Tissue protein extracts
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% SDS) and brain tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl
pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), both supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete, Roche). Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher). Cell lysates and brain
homogenates were separated on protean TGX precast gels (Biorad) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Biorad). Membranes
were blocked for 60 min with 3% BSA and incubated overnight at 4�C with anti-TDP-43 (1:1000, Proteintech), anti-Rab7 (1:1000,
Abcam), anti-LAMP1 (1:1000, DSHB), LAMP2 (1:1000, DSHB, Iowa, USA), anti-PSD95 (1:1000, Millipore), anti-vGlut1 (1:1000, Syn-
aptic Systems), anti-Synapsin (1:1000, Abcam), anti-Synaptophysin (1:1000, Abcam), anti-MBP (1:1000, Abcam), anti-MAP2
(1:1000, Abcam). Protein load was normalized detecting GAPDH (1:5000, Ambion) and b-actin (1:5000, Abcam). After washing mem-
branes were incubated for 60 min with IRDye fluorescent secondary antibody (Li-Cor, Rockland). For detection of Ab in mouse brain,
tissues were processed as follows: homogenization was performed using a glass Teflon homogenizer in 5-fold wet weight amount of
TBS solution (50 mM Tris–Cl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete, Roche). Supernatants
were collected (TBS-soluble fraction) after centrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 hr. The pellets were re-homogenized in TBS-protease
inhibitor cocktail containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Centrifugation was repeated and supernatants were collected
(SDS-soluble fraction) and stored at �80�C for further analysis.
Stereotactic injections of Ab
Ab42 oligomers were prepared as in Fa et al. (2010). Briefly, human Ab42 peptide (Anaspec) was dissolved in HFIP, dried overnight
RT, then resuspended in DMSO at 5 mM. On the day prior experiment, Ab was diluted to 100 mM in ACSF and incubated for 12 hr
overnight at 4�C, allowing oligomers formation. Just before use, Ab42 oligomers were spun down at 14000 g for 10 min, mice were
anesthetized and 4.5 mL were injected per mouse (0.15 mL/min) according to the following stereotactic coordinates: 0.5 mm posterior
to bregma, 1.6 mm lateral to the midline, 1.4 mm ventral. After 24 hr, mice were transcardiacally perfused with 4% PFA, brains were
harvested, post-fixed overnight and further processed for immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemistry and Microscopy
BV2 cells and primary microglia were fixed in PFA 4%, permeabilized for 5min at room temperature (RT) in 0.25% Triton X-100 and
blocked in 2% BSA 0.25% Triton X-100 for 1 hr. Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight in blocking solution at 4�C
(Iba1 1:600, Wako Chemicals, Japan; LAMP-2 1:200, TDP-43 1:200, Proteintech Group, IL, USA). Mice were anesthetized with ke-
tamine/xylazine and transcardially perfused with ice cold HBSS (Invitrogen). Brains were harvested and the hemibrains dissected.
Right hemispheres, kept for histological investigations, were post-fixed overnight in PFA 4%. Serial coronal sections were cut
on a vibratome (60 mm, Leica Microsystems). The left hemibrain was dissected and frozen immediately at �80�C for biochemical

 analyses. For antibody staining, brain sections were permeabilized at room temperature (RT) in 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), followed
by 1 hr RT blocking in 2% BSA 0.5% Triton X-100 and overnight incubation with primary antibody (Iba1 1:600, Wako Chemicals,
Japan; 6E10 1:100, Biolegend; vGlut1 1:100, Synaptic Systems; CD68 1:400, Serotec; PSD-95 1:100, Millipore) at 4�C. Upon
washing, sections were incubated 2 hr RT with Alexa-fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen).
For detection of plaques (b sheets positive structures), brain sections were previously incubated with 1% Thioflavin S (ThioS,
Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri USA) in 50% EtOH for 5 min, washed twice with 50% ethanol, followed by water and PBS washes,
and then subjected to antibody staining as described above.
For spine density, confocal stacks were acquired from the motor/ somatosensory cortex of Thy1-EGFP;Tardbp WT or cKO litter-
mates, based on the GFP signal, and no further staining was required.
Confocal microscopy was performed with a TCS-SP8 (Leica) Laser Scanning System and images were processed and analyzed by
ImageJ Software or Imaris Software (Bitplane, Switzerland), as appropriate. Imaris was used for 3D rendering of confocal images for
colocalization of volumes and quantification analysis.
Human Sample Processing For Ab/ TDP-43 detection
Brain extraction, tissue processing, and histological assessments were performed as previously described (Arnold et al., 2013).
Briefly, after weighing and gross examination, the cerebral cortices were separated into 1-2 cm sections for further evaluation. Tissue
from different brain areas was treated with 10% formalin, paraffin-embedded, cut into 6 mM sections, and stained with hematoxylin-
eosin. Immunohistochemistry was performed using anti-bodies against Ab and phosphorylated TDP-43 (Arnold et al., 2013). Anti-
body used for Ab was NAB228, a monoclonal antibody against Ab applied at a dilution of 1:15000 (Lee et al., 2006). Phosphorylated
TDP-43 was stained with a rat monoclonal corresponding to the amino acid residues 404-413 of human TDP-43 and phosphoserine
409/410 (Neumann et al., 2009).
For CD68 detection: Fresh post-mortem tissue blocks (approximately 1 cm3) were fixed in 10% formalin for a minimum of 24 hr.
Tissue was dehydrated in an ascending series of alcohol (70%–100%), followed by three xylene washes, all for 4 hr each. Next, three
paraffin waxing stages (5 hr each) were performed to ensure full penetration of the embedding wax and then allowed to cool. Sections
were cut on a Leica microtome at 4 mm and collected on glass slides. Sections were dried at 40�C for at least 24 hr before staining.
Immunohistochemistry was performed using standard protocols following a 3min citric acid pretreatment step in a pressure cooker,
enhanced using the Novolink Polymer detection system and visualized using 3,30-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) as chromogen. CD68 pri-
mary antibody (Dako, M0876) was used at 1:100 dilution. Slides were finally counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s to stain cell
nuclei.
Human samples Immunofluorescence Protocol
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides were de-waxed using standard protocols and treated with picric acid for 15 min.
Slides were washed until clear and then placed in 5% Citric Acid (pH 6.0) and pressure cooked to 125oC for 30 s before allowing
to cool. Slides were then coated in autofluorescence eliminator (Merck, Millipore) for 5 min before washing twice in PBS. Blocking
solution (5% BSA/TBS/0.2% Triton X) was applied for 1 hr before primary antibodies (Rabbit a Iba1 – WAKO, WDR2342 (1:750);
Mouse a pTDP43 (s409/s410) – Cosmo Bio Co, TIP-PTD-M01 (1:4000) were added overnight at 4oC in blocking solution. Slides
were washed the next day 3 times with TBS + 0.2% Triton for 5 min each, before adding secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 546
Goat aMouse IgG – Molecular Probes, A11003 (1:500); Alexa Fluor 488 Goat aRabbit IgG – Life Technologies, A11008 (1:500)
and DAPI for 2 hr at RT. Slides were coverslipped with standard mounting media and allowed to dry overnight at room temperature.
Images were captured using a Zeiss AxioScan Slide Scanner Z.1 at 20x and at 63x with a Zeiss LSM510 Confocal microscope.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For Ab clearance quantification, the residual Ab levels measured upon incubation with BV2 cells or primary microglia (see Method
Details) were normalized to the scrambled control and then multiplied for the viability index (Alamar Blue absolute counts, normalized
to the scrambled control). Technical triplicates were averaged, in three different biological experiments. For quantification of fluores-
cently labeled cargos, the specific signal internalized by each cell was measured as percentage of area covered per cell, by using
ImageJ Software. For western blot analysis, immunoreactivity was detected and quantified by using the Odyssey infrared Imaging
System (Li-Cor), and normalized to reference genes, b-actin and GAPDH.
3D imaging analysis was performed by applying recorded algorithms (fixed thresholds for signal intensity and voxel) to all the im-
ages of the same experiment, in order to produce unbiased signal quantification. PSD-95 engulfment analysis was performed by
quantifying the PSD-95 positive volume present in the Iba1 channel (using the mask function). The engulfed PSD-95 volume was
then normalized to the Iba1 and to the total PSD-95 volume in the same acquisition frame.
Spine density analysis was manually conducted by the experimenter and performed blind to genotype. The number of spines per
10 mm was quantified in the cortical layers II/III of cKO;Thy1-GFP mice, on secondary and tertiary apical dendrites.
For quantification of Ab and TDP-43 in human samples: sixteen different brain regions in limbic cortices, isocortical association
areas, sub-cortical regions, and brain stem were assessed for grading of Ab and TDP-43 pathology. The global burden of patho-
logical lesions was semiquantitatively graded on a four-point scale in each of the sixteen regions by experienced neuropathologists

 and neuropathology fellows blinded to the current study design at the time of evaluation (0 = none, 1 = rare/mild, 2 = occasional/mod-
erate, 3 = numerous/severe).
For CD68 quantification in human samples, all sections were assessed using Stereo Investigator. Cortical gray matter was outlined
in each section and immune-positive objects identified using an automated color-based thresholding algorithm in the Stereo Inves-
tigator software. The area of CD68-positive cortex was expressed as a percentage of total cortex.
For each experiment, the corresponding statistics test is indicated in the figure legend. Number of samples for each group is
always shown in the figure. Statistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad Prism Version 7.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA, USA). Values were presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined using Student’s t test and analysis of
variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni’s, Dunnet’s, or Sidak’s post hoc testing as appropriate.
