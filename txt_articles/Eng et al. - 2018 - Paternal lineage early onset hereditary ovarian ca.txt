Abstract
Given prior evidence that an affected woman conveys a higher risk of ovarian cancer to her
sister than to her mother, we hypothesized that there exists an X-linked variant evidenced
by transmission to a woman from her paternal grandmother via her father. We ascertained
3,499 grandmother/granddaughter pairs from the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry at the
Roswell Park Cancer Institute observing 892 informative pairs with 157 affected grand-
daughters. We performed germline X-chromosome exome sequencing on 186 women with
ovarian cancer from the registry. The rate of cancers was 28.4% in paternal grandmother/
granddaughter pairs and 13.9% in maternal pairs consistent with an X-linked dominant
model (Chi-square test X2 = 0.02, p = 0.89) and inconsistent with an autosomal dominant
model (X2 = 20.4, p<0.001). Paternal grandmother cases had an earlier age-of-onset versus
maternal cases (hazard ratio HR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.12–2.25) independent of BRCA1/2 sta-
tus. Reinforcing the X-linked hypothesis, we observed an association between prostate can-
cer in men and ovarian cancer in his mother and daughters (odds ratio, OR = 2.34, p =
0.034). Unaffected mothers with affected daughters produced significantly more daughters
than sons (ratio = 1.96, p<0.005). We performed exome sequencing in reported BRCA neg-
ative cases from the registry. Considering age-of-onset, one missense variant (rs176026 in
MAGEC3) reached chromosome-wide significance (Hazard ratio HR = 2.85, 95%CI: 1.75–
4.65) advancing the age of onset by 6.7 years. In addition to the well-known contribution of
BRCA, we demonstrate that a genetic locus on the X-chromosome contributes to ovarian
cancer risk. An X-linked pattern of inheritance has implications for genetic risk stratification.
Women with an affected paternal grandmother and sisters of affected women are at
increased risk for ovarian cancer. Further work is required to validate this variant and to
characterize carrier families.

 Author summary
Our article uses the largest familial study of ovarian cancer to argue that there exists an
ovarian cancer susceptibility gene on the X-chromosome acting independently of BRCA1
and BRCA2. This observation implies that there may be many cases of seemingly sporadic
ovarian cancer that are actually inherited; for example, only daughters who inherit risk
from their fathers. This X-linked pattern implies novel ways to prioritize families for
screening even without additional testing—sisters must both be carriers or neither; fathers
of women with potentially inherited ovarian cancer may receive new attention. In addi-
tion, we found evidence that other cancers affect fathers and sons in these families. Using
sequencing technology, we isolated a candidate gene, MAGEC3, that may be associated
with earlier onset of ovarian cancer. The further study of this gene and the X-linked pat-
tern will require additional study.
Introduction
A history of ovarian cancer among first-order relatives remains the strongest and best-charac-
terized predictor of ovarian cancer risk [1–3] and a main determinant of genetic testing refer-
ral [4, 5]. The evidence for a monogenic, autosomal dominant mode of inherited risk dates to
the pre-BRCA era where studies focused on assessing heritability [6,7] using affected first-
order and second-order [8] female relatives. In a systematic review, Stratton and colleagues
noted that, “not explicable in terms of any genetic model,” an affected woman’s sisters are at
higher risk of disease than their mother [1]. We propose an explanation to this paradox is the
existence of an X-linked gene that must pass preferentially from a carrier father to each of his
daughters.
Genetic evidence of X-linkage has appeared in cytogenetic studies where loss of X-chromo-
some inactivation (XCI) can be visualized by loss of heterochromatin based Barr bodies [9].
Studies of ovarian tumors’ genomic profiles show loss of heterozygosity around Xq25 and Xp
[10,11] as well as patterns of XCI [12,13] possibly associated with tumors of low malignant
potential [14]. Studies investigating a mechanistic connection between BRCA1 and XCI
[15,16], especially in tissue after transformation [17], are mixed but tend to conclude that XCI
dysregulation is BRCA independent [9,18,19].
The Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry housed at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (Buffalo,
NY), for over 35 years comprises over 50,000 participants and 5,600 cancers in 2,600 families.
To leverage the deep pedigree data in this study, we reasoned that, if the disease allele passes
through the father’s side of the family, it could be inferred by disease in a woman’s father’s
mother. That is, by considering the frequency of disease transmission in grandmother/grand-
daughter pairs with an intermediate son/father. Under an autosomal dominant model, an
affected grandmother (either maternal or paternal) passes the disease allele to her granddaugh-
ter with probability 1/4. This means that data previously presented by affected mothers and sis-
ters are not able to discriminate between autosomal and X-linked models and these effects
have been previously indistinguishable by segregation analysis due to disease censoring in
fathers. In the X-linked dominant model, while a maternal grandmother again passes the dis-
ease allele to her granddaughter with probability 1/4, a paternal grandmother passes the allele to
her granddaughter with probability 1/2 due to deterministic transmission by the obligate carrier
son/father. Therefore, we might discriminate between autosomal versus X-linked models by
considering the rate of cancers in granddaughters with exactly one affected grandmother. An

 autosomal dominant model predicts an equal rate of cancers in maternal-lineage and paternal-
lineage pairs while an X-linked dominant model predicts that paternal-lineage families will have
twice the rate of cancers (Fig 1).
We collected almost 3,500 grandmother/granddaughter pairs within the registry to test this
paternal lineage hypothesis and were able to sequence 159 germlines to search for candidate
variants.
Results
First degree relative ovarian cancer risk
We recapitulated Stratton’s paradox as outlined in Table 1: while mothers of affected women
had a high risk of cancer (35%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 33–37%), sisters had a further
Fig 1. X-linked model. Schema for X-linked inheritance when cancer status is specific to women (all carrier men are
effectively disease censored). Two family patterns with a pair of first-degree affected women are the maternal
grandmother (MGM) family and the paternal grandmother (PGM) family. Stratton’s paradox implies that PGM
families are more likely under X-linkage because a father must pass the variant to all of his daughters. The rates are
equal if the variant is autosomal.

 elevated risk (66%, 65–67%). Unaffected women yielded an increased maternal risk (24%, 23–
26%) while their sisters had the lowest risk (15%, 15–16%). The relative risks (RR) in the regis-
try study (mothers RR = 1.43, sisters RR = 4.42) are close to Stratton’s original estimates
(mothers RR = 1.1, sisters RR = 3.6) [1]. The effect remained for the eldest daughter in each
family versus her sisters, obviating correlation due to multiple sister-pairs. We also noted that
these effects were robust to stratification by familial BRCA status and families manifesting a
hereditary breast and ovary pattern of disease versus families with site-specific ovary disease.
X-linked genetic model testing
Among granddaughters with one affected grandmother (Table 2), we observed a paternal-line-
age cancer rate of 28.4% (95% CI: 22.8–34.8%) and maternal-lineage cancer rate of 13.9%
(11.4–16.8%). The paternal-lineage women had 2.04 times the risk (1.55–2.71) of maternal-
lineage women, consistent with the X-linked dominant model that assumes the rate of pater-
nal-lineage cancers is twice the maternal-lineage rate (goodness-of-fit, chi-square X2 = 0.2,
p = 0.89). The autosomal dominant model predicted too many maternal cancers and too few
paternal cancers (X2 = 20.4, p<0.001). The X-linked effect was robust versus ascertainment
bias; we repeated the analysis excluding the granddaughters who were probands and observed
a nearly identical relative risk (RR = 2.03, 1.28–3.23).
Age-of-onset analysis
We observed a significant acceleration in the development of disease in granddaughters with
an affected paternal grandmother versus maternal grandmother (log-rank test p = 0.009; haz-
ard ratio HR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.12–2.25). Granddaughters with an affected maternal grand-
mother were not more likely to manifest early onset disease versus women with two unaffected
grandmothers (N = 2293, Log-rank p = 0.87, HR = 0.97, 95%CI: 0.75–1.24). While it does not
affect the paternal/maternal effect conclusion, the subset of grandmother-granddaughter pairs

 possesses a higher risk than the average woman in the registry reflecting the selection bias
towards families with more genetic follow up.
Implications of paternal and X-linked cancer
We considered whether men in the path of transmission were more likely to develop other
cancers. In the grandmothers-granddaughter trios with affected granddaughters, the interme-
diate father was more likely to report a prostate cancer diagnosis if his mother had had ovarian
cancer (OR = 2.34, 95%CI: 1.07–5.06, Fisher’s exact test p = 0.0336) implying that the three
generation pattern—ovary, prostate, ovary—was unusually common.
Because cancer-causing germline variants on X might affect the fitness of offspring and lead
to an imbalance in sex birth ratio, we examined whether families were more likely to report
female offspring. Removing the probands from the analysis, among BRCA negative families,
there was a strong bias towards producing daughters when their mother was unaffected

 (female to male ratio = 1.96, difference from 1.0, p < 0.0001), putatively due to an allele trans-
mitted by the father. The effect was attenuated for affected mothers but still significantly
favored daughters (ratio = 1.21, p = 0.0131). Conservatively, this number establishes a baseline
for reporting bias in these families. Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, when the mother was
unaffected thereby favoring paternal transmission, there was a strong bias towards daughters
(ratio = 1.19, p = 0.005). Among BRCA1 mutation families there was no difference in sex ratio
when the mother was affected (ratio = 1.07, p = 0.562). This number is close to the expected
population ratio suggesting minimal ascertainment bias. There were insufficient BRCA2 carry-
ing families to make an assessment.
Among children of men who reported cancers other than prostate cancer, the sex ratio was
consistent with no sex bias (ratio = 1.05, p = 0.554) and, while men with prostate cancer reported
an excess of daughters (ratio = 1.12, p = 0.09), the effect was shy of statistical significance.
Registry-wide pedigree analysis
To estimate the potential impact of X-linked disease, we evaluated the kinship-based likelihood
for autosomal dominant and X-linked models [20] for 1,386 registry pedigrees with at least
two confirmed cases of ovarian cancer. Of these pedigrees, 14 (1.0%) clearly ruled out X-linked
disease due to father-son transmission while 566 (40.8%) were equally likely under X-linked or
autosomal likelihood models. A quarter of families slightly favored X-linkage (338, 24.4%) and
468 (33.7%) had a likelihood ratio greater than 1.5.
We illustrated this imbalanced likelihood in the pedigrees represented in Fig 2, where in
the first family, 4 of 5 daughters at risk developed ovarian cancers between the ages of 43 and
51 (a sixth daughter underwent prophylactic oophorectomy). This situation favors X-linkage:
assuming a carrier penetrance of 0.65 [21] and a non-carrier penetrance of 0.15 (the rate of
familial ovarian cancer), the likelihood of this observation is 0.077 under the autosomal model
and 0.315 under the X-linked model; a likelihood ratio of 4.10. This pattern is therefore appar-
ent in cases of strong familial aggregation within a generation and could be inferred probabilis-
tically. The remaining pedigrees show the paternal grandmother/granddaughter genetic logic,
selecting for pedigrees where the intervening male developed prostate cancer.
X-chromosome exome sequencing
To identify candidate X-linked loci, we sequenced the germline X-chromosome exome and
BRCA1 coding region for 159 affected registry women who reported a negative BRCA test. The
set comprised 49 cases with an affected mother only, 46 with an affected sister only, and 7 with
both. Among the 2,161 common variants, one exceeded the chromosome-wide significance
level (S1A Fig) at position ChrX:140,983,127 (GRCh37/hg19) with LOD = 4.91. This position
mapped to rs176026, a missense SNP (Q8TD91, p.A328T) in the MAGEC3 gene on Xq27.2.
We observed 138 ovarian cancer cases with the A/A genotype, 20 women with the A/G
genotype and 1 woman with the G/G genotype (Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), X2 =
0.086, p = 0.96) (Table 3). While the observed minor allele frequency of 6.9% (22 of 318 alleles)
was not higher than the HapMap CEU frequency (5.3%, t-test p = 0.24), the frequency of A/G
genotypes was significantly higher in registry women (12.6% versus 5.3%, p<0.001). Among
carriers, serous histologies were common (15/21, 71%) and we observed other common epi-
thelial types (2 endometrioid, 2 mucinous, 1 clear cell) as well as a granulosa cell tumor; these
frequencies are similar to the overall distribution of ovarian cancer histologies. Women with
A/A genotypes had a median age-of-onset of 50.3 years (95%CI: 47.8–52.9) reflecting the selec-
tion for family history. Women with A/G genotypes were significantly younger at diagnosis
(43.6 years, 95%CI: 40.0–48.1; log-rank p<0.001, S1B Fig). Notably, all women with A/G

 genotypes developed cancer before age 53. The A/G effect was pronounced for women with
affected sisters only (HR = 6.86, 2.18–21.56) with a median 11.0 years earlier onset (p<0.001).
While women who either carry the rs176026 risk allele or were from BRCA1 variant families
had similar age-of-onset (43 years), rs176026 carriers without BRCA1 variants had a stronger
hazard (HR = 3.17, 1.80–5.58, p<0.001) suggesting that the X-linked variant has the stronger
effect in these families.
In silico functional analysis of rs176026

 (rs73577987, rs73577990) were also weaky linked to rs176026 (R2 = 0.1153, D’ = 0.3395 and R2
= 0.3103, D’ = 0.6478) and retained an age of onset effect. Altogether 28 women had a variant
in any of rs176026 (N = 21), rs176024 (N = 14), rs73577987 (N = 18), or rs73577990 (N = 11)
with a median age of onset of 53.4 (95%CI: 50.4–57.9, log-rank p<0.0001), more than 9.4 years
earlier than the rest of the familial cases (HR = 2.8, 95%CI = 1.8–4.3). The frequency of the
possible haploblock (rs73577987-A, rs73577990-C, rs176024-G, rs176026-G) was 1.96% (15/
766) in all European populations, 0.7% (7/1003) in all African populations, and 26.8% (205/
764) in all East Asian populations.
HaploReg (v4) analysis noted that the rs176026 alternate allele increase the binding affinity
for a HOXA13 motif and a PU.1 (SPI1) motif. rs176024 directly affects a predicted ERα bind-
ing motif reducing the PWM score 80%. While intronic, rs73577987 affected a STAT motif
and an EWSR1-FLI1 motif; rs73577990 affected BDP1, ERα, NRSF and PU.1 motifs. Func-
tional prediction suggested that rs176026 was more likely to be deleterious to secondary pro-
tein structure: PolyPhen-2 predicted rs176026 to have a probably damaging effect (Polyphen
score 0.980, sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.96) [22] and to alter the tertiary structure of MAGEC3
[23] forcing a conformational change that impedes access to the MAGE binding domains
(S1C Fig). In contrast, rs176024 was scored benign (score 0.001, sensitivity 0.99, specificity
0.15).

 family. Unlike other cancer-testis antigens, which are expected to have no expression in nor-
mal tissue, MAGEC3 appears to have low to moderate expression in a range of normal tissues
tested by the GTEx project [24] (S2 Fig). Using the classic CT antigen MAGEA1 to provide a
reference for lower limit of detection, we saw that MAGEC3 had a median expression 83x
(brain) higher than MAGEA1, 47.5x (blood vessel endothelium), 9.2x (ovary) (S3 Fig). Results
were similar for classic CT antigens NY-ESO-1 (CTAG1B), MAGEA3, MAGEC1 while in con-
trast CT-like antigens (NY-BR-1, OY-TES-1) showed higher expression in other tissues.
In contrast, the TCGA mRNA data the level was 1.2x higher (95%CI: 1.19–1.30, Affymetrix
Human Exon 1.0 array) and 0.80x (95%CI: 0.65–0.98, RNAseq, Z-scores). Notably in the can-
cers, there were three groups present: the set around the unity line where MAGEC3 expression
was at the limit of detection, a set left of the line (7.1% 23/306) where MAGEA1 is likely
expressed, a set right of the line (12.4%, 38/306) where MAGEC3 may be expressed. Even for
the fraction of tumors expressing MAGEC3, the level was 2.65 fold lower than normal tissue
(t-test p = 0.0009). These patterns are consistent with the idea that MAGEC3 may perform a
tumor suppressive function like many inherited cancer genes.
As we noted, the G allele frequency for rs176026 in the CEU HapMap study was 5%; in the
African population (YRI), G is the major allele with 65% frequency (S4 Fig). These frequencies
are correlated with the IARC reported incidence of ovarian cancer (Pearson’s r = 0.557 all
HapMap populations) especially when excluding the Chinese American (CHD), African
American (ASW) and Mexican ancestry (MEX) populations living in the United States
(r = 0.858). The 1000 genomes populations were similar (r = 0.903); notably the Japanese in
Tokyo, Japan (JPT), Masaii in Kinyawa, Kenya (MKK) and Luhya in Webuye, Kenya (LWK)
had unusually high incidence of ovarian cancer given their minor allele frequency.
Investigating ascertainment bias
We considered whether the increased frequency of granddaughter cancers might be a result of
ascertainment. Because two qualifying cancer cases are required to register a family, if a
mother cannot contribute the case, then one may suspect the granddaughter is a qualifying
case. In paternal grandmother/granddaughter pairs (N = 229), we noted that 164 granddaugh-
ters did not have cancer and could not be qualifying cases. The second qualifying case was a
sister or paternal aunt in 79.1% of cases. In paternal pairs, 42.3% had an affected paternal aunt
and 6.7% an affected maternal aunt, confirming evidence of specific lineage. The paternal/
maternal granddaughter cancer rate was similar when stratifying pairs by initial ascertainment
by mother/daughter (RR = 2.18, 95%CI:1.76–2.72, N = 220), sister/sister (RR = 2.51, 2.11–2.97,
N = 376), or 2nd degree (RR = 2.15, 1.56–2.93, N = 203) pair. We conclude that the ascertain-
ment bias due to an unaffected mother is minimal and the notion that the relevant pairs repre-
sent paternal lineage is well supported.
Reflecting a maternal-lineage ascertainment bias, there were more maternal than paternal
pairs (663 versus 229). Mean accession identifiers for maternal and paternal grandmothers are
10.3 and 14.9, respectively (two-sample t-test, p<0.001; medians 9 and 14), suggesting that we
have preferentially contacted maternal grandmothers. The direction of this potential bias is
consistent with our suspicion that paternal pairs are underreported and reduces the precision
of the paternal-lineage cancer rate estimate. Granddaughters with ovarian cancer in maternal
families were not older than paternal-lineage women (mean difference 1.8 years, two-sample t-
test p = 0.39), but unaffected women were 4.2 years older (p<0.001). While statistically signifi-
cant, this difference was not likely to be the source of a 14% increase in cancer risk.
The rate of granddaughter ovarian cancers was not different between families with and
without BRCA1/2 mutations (37.3% versus 38.2%, two-sample t-test p = 0.89), therefore

 BRCA status cannot be a confounding variable for women ascertained for family history.
Alternatively, we observed the risk- doubling effect when stratifying 864 pairs into site-specific
ovary (RR = 2.06, 1.45–2.92) or breast/ovary syndrome families (RR = 1.84, 1.22–2.78); there
was no confounding by a family history of breast cancer. Therefore, an X-linked gene might
confer ovarian cancer-specific risk independent of BRCA-type disease.
Discussion
We have presented evidence that there may exist an X-linked model of transmission of an
ovarian cancer susceptibility gene. Our observations are supported by a large familial study
and the novel use of grandmother/granddaughter pairs to observe an increased rate of cancer
among paternal granddaughters, an earlier age of onset, and a bias towards families with more
daughters. We sequenced the X chromosomes of a small number of registry members in order
to isolate a candidate gene, but we cannot rule out the possibility that our reported variant is in
linkage with the true variant. However, the segregation analysis and age of onset analyses do
suggest that it is likely to lie on the X chromosome.
Future studies are warranted to confirm the identity and function of the X-linked gene that
contributes to familial transmission of ovarian cancer. Limitations of our study include the
case-only design, which has required us to forgo investigating common variants. While the
number of pedigrees in the registry is large, unrelated case-control studies are much larger and
would likely yield other potential variants. Our study population is nearly exclusively Cauca-
sian and our results may not extend to other populations. Our exome sequencing approach
focuses on the coding regions of the X-chromosome only. This design is unable to identify
intragenic variants and complex rearrangements not involving exons.
Evidence of X-linkage is not inconsistent with the prevailing autosomal dominant BRCA1/
2 with polygenic weak variant effects model for ovarian cancer [8]. Ramus and colleagues [21]
previously noted a lack of BRCA mutations in more than 33% of families with 3 or more ovar-
ian cancers and 35% of families with breast/ovary cancers and concluded that there is a miss-
ing susceptibility gene. In families with two cases of ovarian cancer, the rate of BRCA
mutations increased from 27% with no breast cancers to 83% with two breast cancer cases sug-
gesting that BRCA mutations may be more specific to breast cancers. Schildkraut and col-
leagues [25] inferred that there must exist both shared and disease-specific genes after
estimating the heritable correlation between breast and ovary cancers at h2 = 0.48. The missing
gene might be ovarian cancer specific.
We suspect that the difficulty identifying this missing heritability may be due, in part, to
historically inconsistent disease definition. In our literature review, we noted that studies that
ascertained patients for breast cancer first and then acquired family members with ovarian
cancer only saw increased risk to mothers [26]. Indeed, aggregated breast/ovary cancer studies
[27] tend to show the autosomal dominant model while studies that carefully isolate ovary can-
cers uncover the X-linked, sister/mother effect [1]: given a family history of breast cancer, a
mother with breast cancer increases the ovarian cancer risk to her daughter (OR = 2.3) while
an affected sister yields a negligible odds ratio (OR = 1.1). Conversely in families with a history
of ovarian cancer only, a mother’s ovarian cancer raised her daughters’ ovarian cancer risk
(OR = 2.3, but p>0.05) while a sister’s ovarian cancer nearly quadruples her sister’s risk
(OR = 3.92) [28]. Therefore, the autosomal dominant genes may be common to both breast
and ovary cancers while the X-linked gene may be ovary-specific. We emphasize that future
studies should be carefully designed to isolate X-linked versus autosomal and ovary-specific
versus breast-ovary associations and to distinguish sporadic and hereditary ovarian cancers.
Identifying a significant X-linked contribution to familial ovarian cancer risk has implications
X-linked ovarian cancer

 for clinical genetics: with suspicion of paternal lineage, an affected woman’s sisters are at sig-
nificantly increased risk for ovarian cancer and ought to be counseled. If the affected woman
carries the X-linked gene through her father, her sisters must also be carriers. It is reasonable
to conjecture that maternal-lineage bias may have affected how patients, physicians, and
researchers view family history and so the X-linked pattern may imply a familial origin for
ovarian cancers previously thought to be sporadic cases. In particular, if the disease transmits
through the father’s side, cases manifesting in only children or a woman with only brothers
may not appear overtly hereditary. Using the rate of second generation grandmother pairs, we
observed twice as many affected maternal grandmothers versus paternal. Without ascertain-
ment bias, we would have expected a balanced rate, so we might predict that, other things
equal, we have missed almost two paternal cases for every observed one.
We have provided some evidence that MAGEC3 is a potential candidate for the X-linked
gene near previous linkage loci and it possesses a missense variant with large effect, rare preva-
lence and is associated with earlier onset. While MAGEC3 is thought to be a cancer testis anti-
gen, it shows some expression in normal heart, brain, fallopian tube and pituitary gland tissues
suggesting that the loss of expression of MAGEC3 plays some role in cancer formation. We
have previously shown that co-expression patterns of the MAGE genes are non-random in
ovarian tumors [29] and that other X-linked CT antigens (NY-ESO-1 encoded by CTAG1B)
signaling highly aggressive tumors [30].
The only MHD-carrying yeast homologous gene (NSE3) binds with NSE1 and complexes
with SMC5/SMC6 to repair double strand breaks via homologous recombination [31–33]. On
the other hand, family members MAGEA [34, 35], MAGEC2 [36], carrying a paralogous
MHD, have been shown to bind to RING domain proteins to form a p53 interacting E3 ubi-
quitin ligase that promotes tumorigenesis. Recently, computational modeling of sex-bias in
cancers affecting both sexes has identified MAGEC3 directly as a putative X-linked tumor sup-
pressor [37]. Reinforcing our observation that men in X-linked families may be at increased
risk of prostate cancer, the cytoband housing MAGEC3 (Xq27.2) has been previously linked to
these hereditary cancers [38], raising the possibility that there is a common hereditary X-
linked locus responsible for reproductive tract-specific cancers.
While not unexpected for the X-chromosome [39], the candidate SNP appeared to rest in
HWE while the HapMap populations reject HWE for this SNP. Given that the population fre-
quencies are correlated with ovarian cancer incidence, we conjecture that the general popula-
tion is under selection against the G allele (and against ovarian cancer) and it is the registry
population that inherits neutrally and therefore more often manifests disease. This conjecture
is consistent with the observations that CT antigens, especially those on the X chromosome,
are under strong positive selection [40] and that the region containing MAGEC3 shows strong
inter-population difference [41]. While the latter study localized the effect to MAGEC2 and
not MAGEC3, their criterion for the frequency difference was aggressively high (delta > 0.90)
which would preclude the SNPs that may be still be in the middle of a soft selective sweep.
That the beneficial A allele in rs176026 has not yet fixed may explain why we have found a
common variant, but it may also imply that the true cancer phenotype variant is hitchhiking
along with the selective pressure behind the CT antigens.
Methods
Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry
Families in the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry (formerly Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian
Cancer Registry, Buffalo, NY) have been accessioned continuously from 1981 to present as
described previously [8,42]. Briefly, qualifying families must have (a) two or more cases of
X-linked ovarian cancer
PLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007194
February 15, 2018
11 / 17
 ovarian cancer, (b) one ovarian cancer with two or more other cancers or (c) an early onset
(age 45) ovarian cancer and at least one other cancer. Families provide written informed con-
sent under Roswell Park Cancer Institute protocol CIC95-27. Cases are verified by medical
record and/or death certificate when required and stage and histology are verified by a registry
pathologist. The registry comprises 50,401 individuals including 5,614 ovarian cancers from
2,636 unique families. Families are also classified by disease pattern: families manifesting only
ovarian cancer are termed “site-specific ovary” families and families with a number of breast
cancers as well as ovarian cancers are “breast and ovary” families.
First and second order pair ascertainment
Considering women who (a) were at least 45 without disease at last contact or (b) had died
without disease and those with confirmed ovarian cancer, we observed over 8,900 mother-
daughter pairs and 27,000 sister-sister pairs. From large registry pedigrees, we ascertained
3,499 women with two grandmothers who possessed a recorded disease status. Of these grand-
daughters, 2,569 reported no affected grandmothers (73.4%), 892 had exactly one affected
grandmother (25.5%) and 38 had two affected grandmothers (1.1%). These women came from
large pedigrees where the average family under study has 27.3 individuals (range: 8–330). Of
the 3,499 pairs, 619 belonged to high-risk families tested for BRCA mutations as previously
described [8]. Families are classified as BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 positive if any one family mem-
ber tests positive for a deleterious mutation. If every family member tests negative, the family
is classified as BRCA negative.
X-chromosome sequencing
Due to the age of the study cohort and availability of blood samples, we could not sequence all
of the grandmother/granddaughter pairs. We focused on 159 women who reported a negative
BRCA test and had an available DNA sample. DNA samples were whole-exome sequenced
using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exome 50Mb kits v3 and v5. Raw sequence reads were
aligned to the Human Reference Genome (NCBI Build 37) using the Burrows-Wheeler
Aligner (BWA) [43], Picard [44] and GATK [45]. We retained variants within the X-chromo-
some exome with at least a 10% rate of non-reference genotypes, using the total, 2,161, to set
the chromosome-wide significance threshold for the log-rank test of age-of-onset association
at–log10(0.05/2161) = 4.636 on the log odds (LOD) scale. BRCA status was re-evaluated based
on the sequencing results.
Population genetics
Ovarian cancer incidence data was downloaded from the IARC website [46]. HapMap allele
frequencies were accessed via dbSNP and 1000 genomes populations via the Phase 3 1000
genomes browser. Correlations between the incidence and allele frequency were assessed by
simple linear regression. The sequenced women all self-report Caucasian ancestry which we
confirmed through principal components analysis.
Within sib-ship likelihood models
Assume that we observe W = Wn + Wc women with ovarian cancer among a sistership of
N = Nn + Nc women, where the subscripts n and c refer to non-carriers and variant carriers.
The likelihood of W given the probability of disease in carriers (pc) and non-carriers (pn) can
be constructed by assuming that, conditional on Nn and Nc, Wn and Wc are simply binomial
random variables. Under an autosomal model, Nc is Binomial (N, 0.5). Under the X-linked
X-linked ovarian cancer

 model, P(Nc = N) = P(Nc = 0). Evaluating these likelihoods by enumerating admissible combi-
nations of (Wn, Wc, Nn, Nc) is straightforward.
Tissue expression data
We downloaded GTEx v7 data (https://www.gtexportal.org/) aligning reported female cases
only with known tissue sample types. We normalized the MAGEC3 RNAseq levels to
MAGEA1 levels on a per sample basis. TCGA ovary data on the quantile normalized HuEx
array were downloaded from the GDAC Firehose (https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/) and cBio-
Portal’s normalized RNAseq Z-scores.
Functional analysis
We examined SNP-based linkage via LDLink, LDproxy [47] using the CEU population for ref-
erence. The functional predictions for missense SNPs were scored by PolyPhen [22] and the
regulation was scored by HaploReg (v4) [48] using the EUR reference and its default position
weight-matrix scoring algorithms [49].
Statistical analysis
Expected frequencies under the autosomal model were based on the pooled case frequency
(157/892 = 17.6%). It can be shown that the X-linked likelihood was maximized by a grand-
daughter cancer rate of 14.0%. Goodness-of-fit was tested versus a chi-square distribution.
Pedigree likelihoods were evaluated using the kinship2 [20] algorithms. Relative risk and odds
ratio confidence intervals were computed under the log transform. Age-of-onset was defined
as the shortest time to death, ovarian cancer diagnosis or prophylactic oophorectomy censored
by age at last contact. The majority of granddaughter ages were observed (89.0%, 3080/3461).
Risk of disease was estimated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) estimate, tested with the
log-rank test and hazard ratios estimated through Cox’s partial likelihood with graphical diag-
nostics for proportional hazards. All tests are two-sided and analyses were performed in R3.3.1
including the survival package.
