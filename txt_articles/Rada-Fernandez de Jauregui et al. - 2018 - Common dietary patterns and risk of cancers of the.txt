Few prospective cohort studies in the UK have specifically focused on the associations between commonly consumed dietary
patterns and colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of our study was to assess whether red meat, poultry, fish and vegetarian die-
tary patterns are associated with differences in the incidence of cancers of colon and rectum in the UKWCS. Four common die-
tary patterns were defined based on a hierarchy of consumption of red meat, poultry and fish for each cohort participant,
using a 217-item food frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to provide adjusted hazard
ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CRC. A total of 32,147 women recruited and surveyed between 1995 and
1998 were followed up for a mean of 17.2 years (426,798 person-years). A total of 462 incident CRC cases were documented;
335 colon cancers (172 proximal and 119 distal) and 152 in the rectum. In multivariable-adjusted models, there was no evi-
dence of a reduction in risk of overall CRC (HR 5 0.86, 95% CI: 0.66–1.12), colon cancer (HR 5 0.77, 95% CI: 0.56–1.05) or
rectal cancer (HR 5 1.04, 95% CI: 0.66–1.63) when comparing grouped red meat free diets with diets containing red meat.
Exploratory analysis suggested a reduced risk of distal colon cancer in grouped red meat free diets (HR 5 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34–
0.95), though numbers with this outcome were small. These results indicate that a protective association of red meat free
diets specifically on distal colon cancer merits confirmation in a larger study.
Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diag-
nosed cancer in women and the third in men worldwide.1
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in
2015
classified
red
meat
as
“probably
carcinogenic
to
humans” and processed meat as “carcinogenic to humans,”
based mainly on evidence linked to CRC.2 The most recent
(September 2017), World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)
and American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) continu-
ous update project (CUP) have arrived to no conclusion due
to limited evidence on dietary patterns and CRC.3 Different
meta-analyses indicate that high intake of red meat and proc-
essed meat is associated with significant increased risk of
colorectal, colon and rectal cancer.4–7 Hence, vegetarian diets
or low meat diets may be expected to be associated with a
lower risk of CRC given their lack of, or reduced, meat con-
tent, but current scientific evidence remains inconsistent and
requires further explanation. Some of the inconsistency in
findings may be owing to the complete exclusion of any
source of meat or fish protein from the diet (pure vegetarian
diet)8 and CRC subsites.9 Early results from the EPIC-Oxford
study found an approximately 50% greater risk of CRC for
vegetarians.10 Later, as incident cases increased, adverse

 associations for vegetarians turned into null, in regard to
both CRC mortality11,12 and CRC incidence.13,14 Analysis
from pooled data from prospective food diaries, among UK
cohorts with low to moderate meat intakes, showed little evi-
dence of association between consumption of red and proc-
essed meat and CRC risk.15 However, the prospective cohort
trial of Seventh Day Adventist in the USA has found that
vegetarian diets, especially pesco-vegetarians, those who eat
fish but no meat, are associated with an overall lower inci-
dence of CRC.16 Recently, fish intake has also been found to
be inversely associated with the risk of rectal cancer.17
Another cohort study carried out in the Netherlands found
pesco-vegetarians and 1 day/week meat eaters had a modest
but non-significantly decreased risk of CRC compared to 6–7
day/week meat consumers.18 The traditional approach in
nutritional epidemiology concentrates on the effects of single
nutrients or foods on CRC. However, nutrients and foods are
consumed in combination, so effects on disease risk benefit
from considering the entire eating pattern. Dietary patterns
may go further than individual nutrient exposures when
explaining disease occurrence19 and can be easier to translate
into public health recommendations compared to focusing
on individual nutrients.20
The UK Women’ s Cohort Study (UKWCS) is a large
British cohort of women with a long follow up period and
was designed to include a wide range of different meat and
meat-free dietary intakes. Here, we examine the associations
between common dietary patterns including red meat eaters,
poultry eaters, fish eaters and vegetarians and the association
with the incidence of cancers of the colon and rectum. An
exploratory analysis of the risk of colon cancer subsites is
also presented.
Methods
Study design, study population and ethical approval
Women were recruited into the UKWCS from responders to
a direct mail survey of the World Cancer Research Fund
(WCRF) between 1995 and 1998, with around half a million
responders from England, Wales and Scotland.
Further
details of the process have been described previously.21 The
WCRF questionnaire included brief dietary details allowing
selection of all women who characterized themselves as vege-
tarian or non-red-meat eaters and a comparison group from
the remaining eligible women. The comparison group was
chosen by matching by age, within 10 years of each
vegetarian, to the next non-vegetarian responder. A total of
35,372 women aged 35–69 years returned the baseline postal
questionnaire. A specific feature of the UKWCS was that it
was designed to include large numbers of subjects consuming
three main dietary patterns: vegetarian, eating fish (not meat)
and meat eaters.22 This approach was adopted to maximize
power for comparisons of interest between diet and cancer
while minimizing the effect of measurement error.23–25 Ethi-
cal approval was granted at its initiation in 1993 (Research
Ethics Committee reference number is 15/YH/0027).
Baseline characteristics and dietary patterns construction
Anthropometrics,
lifestyle
factors
and
socio-demographic
information were self-reported with socio-economic status
(SES) based on occupation. Information on physical activity
was collected by questionnaire. The participants’ diet was
assessed using a 217-item, self-administered food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ). The FFQ was based on that used in the
Oxford arm of the Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) study
and adapted for use with vegetarians. Completion of the
questionnaire simply required placing a tick in the box to
indicate how frequently each food had been consumed over
the last 12 months. Any single missing items were assumed
to have not been consumed. Standard portion weights were
assigned and energy and nutrient intakes was derived using
McCance & Widdowson’s The Composition of Foods (5th
Edition) (Holland et al., 1991). In this analysis, four com-
monly
recognized
eating
patterns
were
used
based
on
response frequencies of meat and fish items on the FFQ.
Vegetarians were defined as those participants who consumed
red meat poultry, or fish less than once a week; fish eaters
were defined as those participants who consumed fish at least
once a week but not poultry or red meat; poultry eaters were
defined as those participants who consumed poultry at least
once a week and may eat fish but not red meat; and red
meat eaters were defined as those participants who consumed
meat at least once a week and may or may not consume
poultry and fish. Red meat is defined as beef, pork, lamb,
offal and processed meats.26
Case definition
Registrations of cancer diagnosis for women in the UKWCS
were made via record linkage of cancer identification codes
from the central register of NHS Digital. The cancer out-
comes used in the analyses are incident malignant neoplasms
What’s new?
Eating red meat may affect one’s risk of colon cancer. Here, the authors looked for a relationship between colorectal cancer
risk and red meat, poultry, fish, and vegetarian diets. They used data from the UK Womens Cohort study, with dietary informa-
tion collected by survey. No statistically significant association was found for total CRC risk, but when they looked at specific
cancer sub-sites, a correlation emerged. Although numbers were small, a reduction in distal CRC risk was observed among
those who did not eat red meat. A larger study would be desirable to confirm these findings.

 of the colon (codes 153.0–153.9 or C18) and of the recto sig-
moid junction and of the rectum (codes 154.0–154.1 or C19
and C20) of the International Statistical Classification of Dis-
eases (ICD), 9th and 10th editions.27,28 Cancer of the colon
included proximal colon tumors (cecum, appendix, ascending
colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon and splenic flexure:
C18.0–C18.5) and distal colon tumors (descending and sig-
moid colon: C18.6 and C18.7). Colon cancers were defined in
the ICD as those occurring above the peritoneal delineation
of the abdominal cavity, and rectal cancers were those occur-
ring below this delineation. Tumors originating proximal to
the splenic flexure (cecum, ascending colon and transverse
colon) were considered proximal colon cancers, whereas
those tumors arising in the descending or sigmoid colon
were considered distal colon cancers. Recto sigmoid cancers
were defined as rectal cancers and anal cancers were excluded
from the analysis as described in previous publications.29
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to describe baseline character-
istics of participants according to dietary patterns. Survival
analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between
four dietary patterns and colorectal, colon (exploratory analy-
sis of proximal and distal colon subsites) and rectal cancer
risk. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to provide
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for
the estimation of relative risk of cancers. The red meat eating
category was used as reference category. The time variable
used in the models was time in the study, calculated from
the date of questionnaire receipt until either death or censor
date (1st of April 2014). Covariates were selected for inclu-
sion in the regression models based on published information
on convincing confounders for CRC. Associations were esti-
mated first as a simple age-adjusted model, and finally as a
multivariable adjusted model including age (years), body
mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), energy intake (kcal/day), physical
activity (hr/day), smoking status (never, current or former
smoker), family history of CRC in a first degree relative and
socio-economic status (professional/managerial, intermediate
or routine and manual). Education was not included because
too many women were lost due to the missing data and also
because it is potentially correlated with socioeconomic status.
As a sensitivity analysis other nutritional variables such as
ethanol consumption, dietary fiber, calcium, iron and folate
and risk factors like polyps in the large intestine were
included as additional confounders but no substantial differ-
ences were observed in the results (data not shown). Further
analysis of robustness of results was carried out by merging
the poultry and fish eaters into one group due the low num-
ber in the poultry group. The proportional hazards assump-
tion was tested graphically for all terms in the model. To
account for the stratified sampling scheme at recruitment,
over-sampling vegetarians and fish-eaters, statistical models
used weights based on the inverse probability of being sam-
pled to provide estimates more representative of the UK
population.26,29 All the statistical analyses were conducted
using Stata version 13 statistical software.30

(n 5 688), women self-reporting history of any previous
malignant cancer at baseline, except for non-melanoma of
the skin (n 5 2,398), women who were diagnosed with CRC
within 1 year of baseline (n 5 53) and women with energy
intakes outside the plausible range of 500–6,000 kcal/day
(n 5 86). After these exclusions, 32,147 cohort participants
were eligible for this analysis. Of these, 65% (20,848) were
classified as red meat eaters, 3% (899) were poultry eaters,
13% (4,141) were fish eaters and 19% (6,259) were vegeta-
rians. Some demographic and lifestyle characteristics, medical
history, as well as nutrient and food intake at baseline data
collection of these groups are summarized in Table 1. At
baseline, the mean age was 52 years and the average BMI
24.4 (kg/m2). Cohort participants were relatively health con-
scious, with a low proportion of smokers (11%) and a large
proportion reported taking dietary supplements (58%). More
detail regarding the UKWCS cohort has been reported previ-
ously.21,22 Women in the poultry eaters, fish eaters and vege-
tarian groups were likely to be younger, had a lower BMI
and engaged in more physical activity compared to red meat
eaters. Physical activity was highest in the fish eaters and
lowest in the red meat eaters. A higher percentage of the fish
eaters and vegetarians were from a professional and manage-
rial social background compared to the red meat and poultry
eating groups. Self-reported history of polyps in the large
intestine was higher in the red and poultry groups with fairly
similar history of CRC in four groups. Red meat eaters and
fish eaters tended to have a higher energy intake and higher
alcohol intake and fish eaters had highest consumption of
fiber, iron, calcium, folate and vitamin C. To account for
these differences observed, we controlled for the correspond-
ing variables in multivariate analyses.
Red meat and red meat-free dietary patterns
Over a mean follow up of 17.2 years a total of 462 incident
CRC cases were documented in the UKWCS (426,798 per-
son-year). Of these cases, 335 were colon cancers, 172 in the
proximal and 119 in the distal colon, and 152 in the rectum;
25 cases were diagnosed with both colon and rectal cancer
and information on subsite was not available for 44 colon
cancers. Table 2 presents the results of Cox proportional haz-
ards regression models for grouped red meat-free diets com-
pared to red meat diet, for all colorectal cancers combined,
colon (combined and subsites) and rectal cancers, separately.
Red meat-free diets showed a non-significant risk reduction
in overall CRC (HR 5 0.86, 95% CI: 0.66–1.12) and colon
cancer (HR 5 0.77, 95% CI: 0.56–1.05) with risk close to the

 null in the case of the rectal cancer (HR 5 1.04, 95% CI:
0.66–1.63). In the exploratory analysis of colon subsites a sig-
nificant risk reduction on distal colon cancer was observed in
red meat-free diets compared to red meat diets in both the
age adjusted model (HR 5 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36–0.92) and the
fully adjusted model (HR 5 0.56, 95% CI: 0.34–0.95).
In the sensitivity analysis where poultry and fish eaters
were merged, estimates were broadly similar and conclusions
did not change. These two types of dietary patterns tend to
have a similar effect on risk of CRC.
Dietary patterns and colorectal cancers
The association between the common dietary patterns and
risk of CRC, both overall and by subsites (exploratory), are
presented in Table 3, for both Model 1 (age-adjusted) and
Model 2 (multivariable-adjusted). In multivariable-adjusted
models, poultry eaters (HR 5 0.85, 95% CI: 0.45–1.60), fish

and
vegetarians
(HR 5 0.80, 95% CI: 0.58–1.11) showed a non-significant risk
reduction compared to red meat eaters for risk of CRC. In
the fully adjusted model, vegetarians showed the highest risk
reduction compared to red meat eaters in the case of colon
cancer, although confidence intervals were wide (HR 5 0.71,

 free patterns (poultry eaters, fish eaters and vegetarians)
showed a non-significant risk reduction (p 5 0.062) compared
to high red meat eaters for risk of CRC in multivariable-
adjusted models.
In the case of rectal cancer, vegetarians (HR 5 0.91, 95%
CI: 0.55–1.52) and fish eaters (HR 5 0.98, 95% CI: 0.52–1.85)
were close to the null effect while the small group of poultry
eaters showed an increased risk of rectal cancer but as with
previous results, intervals were very wide CI (HR 5 1.37, 95%
CI: 0.55–3.41). Exploratory analysis between the dietary pat-
terns and the different colon subsites cancer risk showed
broadly similar associations but with higher effect sizes in the
case of distal colon (Table 3). Poultry eaters (HR 5 0.33, 95%
CI: 0.05–2.37) showed the highest associated risk reduction
but the 95% CI was wide.
Discussion
UKWCS is a large cohort with varied dietary intakes, includ-
ing a high number of non-red-meat eaters, and a long follow
up period; consequently this is one of the largest analyses
comparing commonly consumed dietary patterns and the
risk of CRC in the UK. In our study, there was insufficient
evidence for any differences between the dietary pattern
groups and risk of CRC, though confidence intervals were
wide. In the UKWCS, red meat eaters were more likely to be
older and less well educated11 with a higher body mass index
and lower physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake
than the other groups. A similar pattern was seen in partici-
pants who were most likely to eat meat in the EPIC cohort.31
The red meat eating dietary pattern in our cohort consumed
on average relatively low amounts of red meat (mean 51.6 g/
day) and processed meat (mean 19.1 g/day). Our results are
not statistically significant for red meat eating dietary pat-
terns and overall risk of CRC, however, a red meat-free diet
was significantly protective against distal colon cancer. This
is of interest from a public health point of view as in this
cohort, a red meat eating pattern characterized by lower
overall meat intakes, may be generally at lower risk of colo-
rectal cancers compared to populations with a higher meat
consumption; for example, women aged 35–59 years in the
National Diet and Nutrition Survey are consuming on aver-
age 131 g meat/Day.32 There is a biological plausibility of the
effect of red meat on CRC related mainly with components
in red meat or which are formed during the cooking of meat
that may increase colorectal cancer risk including animal fat,
heme iron, heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and the endogenous

 formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs),33 but dose–
response relationships and specially the effect of low meat
intake on CRC remains unclear.4 In a sensitivity analysis
comparing high (�130 g per day) and low/medium read
meat and processed meat consumption (<130 g per day) on
CRC we did not find a significant risk reduction for the risk
of CRC.
Additional foods in the diet other than red meat may be
also associated with a decreased risk of CRC including milk
and whole grains.34,35 Specific nutrients such as calcium and
fiber which are present in high levels in those foods, have
also been associated with a lower risk of CRC.34 Analysis
based on nutrient patterns suggests that patterns character-
ized by high intakes of vitamins and minerals are inversely
associated with CRC as is a pattern rich in riboflavin, phos-
phorus and calcium.36 In our analysis we explored differences
in dietary variables (calcium, folate and fiber) between dietary
patterns (data not shown) but did not see substantial differ-
ences between patterns. For this reason they were not
included in the model to avoid over adjusting.37 Recent stud-
ies have found that particularly pesco-vegetarians were at
lower risk of CRC.16,17 We observed a possible protective
association between fish and vegetarian diets and subsequent
CRC incidence but as in previous UK-based studies11–14 no

Risk of cancers of the colon and rectum
Int. J. Cancer: 00, 00–00 (2018) V

 statistically significant differences were observed. Fish eaters
in the UKWCS were younger, with a lower energy intake,
and were more likely to consume 400 g or more of fruit and
vegetables per day. A recent review suggests that data on
Selenium (Se) intake and status in British vegetarians could
help to explain why studies on vegetarians in the UK present
different results from the US. British vegetarians may be more
likely to have a low Se status and this may contribute to the
largely null results of studies of CRC risk in vegetarians in the
UK.2 In concordance, results from a case–control study of the
EPIC cohort indicates that Se status is suboptimal in many
Europeans and suggests an inverse association between CRC
risk and higher serum Se status, especially in women38 In our
study, the null results can be also explained because our defini-
tion of vegetarian was not completely strict, allowing vegeta-
rians to consume meat, poultry or fish in small amounts (less
than once a week). Existing evidence that n-3 fatty acids inhibit
colorectal carcinogenesis is in line with these results, but few
data are available addressing this association.39 Dietary patterns
rich in fish consumption may be protective for CRC and a
study of the UKWCS concludes that women adhering to a
Mediterranean dietary pattern also low in red meat may have a
lower risk of CRC, especially rectal cancer.29 In our study, risk
estimates for rectal cancer, showed a weak protective associa-
tion in the case of fish-eaters and vegetarians, with a null asso-
ciation in the poultry eaters group. However, none of the
results reached statistical significance.
The effect of poultry on CRC in not clear. A meta-analysis
studying meat subtypes found no association for poultry con-
sumption and risk of CRC.40 Results regarding poultry eaters
in our study is in concordance with this, although there is a
suggestion of a non-significant protective effect on colon can-
cer. However, due to the low number of cases in the poultry
group all results should be interpreted with care. It is interest-
ing to note that the poultry eating dietary pattern in our study
was characterized by consumption of similar amounts of fish as
were consumed in the fish eating pattern. No further sub-
analysis of poultry eaters (with and without eating fish) was
carried out due to the low number of participants in this group.
Exploratory colon cancer subsite analysis
Exploratory analysis of colon subsites showed that grouped
meat-free diets showed a significant negative association with
risk of distal colon cancer compared to red meat diets. Only
a limited number of prospective studies have looked at the
relationship between meat or dietary patterns containing
meat and development of CRC by subsite across the colon
(i.e., proximal vs. distal colon).4,5,41–43 Our findings appear to
be consistent with previous studies where high levels of red
meat were associated with distal colon cancer.9 However, pre-
vious research has also reported that red meat may be more
strongly associated with colorectal and colon cancers but not
with rectal cancer4 while processed meat may be more
strongly associated with distal cancers than proximal can-
cers.43 Other studies have seen no association in all three
subsites.44 Our cohort consumes low intakes of processed red
meat and therefore we might expect lower numbers of cases
of distal cancers.
There are some biological explanations that support the
risk of red and processed meat on the distal colon. The con-
centrations
of
the
pro-mutagenic
lesion
O6-
methyldeoxyguanosine, a marker of exposure to many NOCs,
have been shown to be significantly greater in tissues from
the distal colon and rectum than from the proximal colon.45
However, further research is needed to clarify this point. A
further explanation could be that butyrate concentrations are
highest in the distal colon. Butyrate is produced by fermenta-
tion of dietary fiber and has been shown to induce apoptosis
and to be cytotoxic to colorectal adenoma cells.41
The proximal colon and distal colon arise from different
embryonic tissues, serve different functions, mucosal properties
and microenvironment differ between segments, and are
exposed to fecal matter for different durations of time. Hence,
it has been suggested that the proximal and distal colon should
be considered separately in aetiological studies of cancer, with
the splenic flexure as a demarcation point.46 However, other
studies challenge the current two-colon paradigm and suggest
that the frequencies of key tumor molecular features change
gradually along the length of the colon. As meat consumption
may impact differently across the three regions of the colorec-
tum (proximal colon, distal colon or rectum), differences by
types of red meat and by dietary patterns and cancer location is
one of the biggest challenges in the study of diet and CRC with
true associations remaining unclear.
Strengths
Our study has several important strengths: the UKWCS is a
large cohort with varied dietary intakes and a long follow up
period and this is one of the largest analysis on this topic in
the UK. The population-based design enhances the generaliz-
ability of our results; specific subsites within the colon were
examined separately. In addition, because exposure informa-
tion was collected before the cancer diagnosis, any measure-
ment error would have been non differential between cases
and non-cases and would most likely weaken any true associ-
ation rather than causing an overestimation.
Limitations
Since this is a prospective study, risk of recall bias is reduced.
However, an ongoing challenge in nutritional epidemiology is
accurate measurement of food intake. The FFQ used in this
cohort has been validated against biomarkers37 and follows
recommendations for good design.38 Our cohort is generally
healthy as evidenced by relatively low smoking rates and low
body mass index.11 It is therefore possible that less healthy
dietary patterns were underrepresented in our cohort making
differences between groups harder to elicit. The pragmatic
definition of the dietary patterns used in this analysis may
have led to the non-significant findings. Use of categories in
this way to define dietary patterns does not allow for

 examination of a possible dose–response effect of key compo-
nents of the diet. In this analysis, processed meat was
included as red meat. Colon cancer subsite analysis is pre-
sented as exploratory due to the limited power and multiple
comparisons. Only women were included in our study but
there is no clear evidence around variation between men and
women in previous research.17,45
Conclusion
In summary, grouped and independently analyzed red-meat
free diets showed a non-significantly decreased risk of CRC
compared to red meat eaters. Only exploratory subsite analy-
sis showed a significant risk reduction for distal colon cancer
in red meat-free dietary patterns. These results indicate that
protective associations of red meat free diets on colorectal
cancers merit further investigation in a larger study with
larger numbers of cases.
