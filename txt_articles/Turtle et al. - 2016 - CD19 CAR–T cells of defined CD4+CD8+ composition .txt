Introduction
The administration of lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed 
by adoptive transfer of autologous T cells that are genetically 
modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for 
CD19 (CD19 CAR–T cells) has produced a high rate of complete 
remission (CR) in adult and pediatric patients with relapsed and 
refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in small 
phase I clinical trials (1–4). Encouraging results have also been 
seen in clinical trials of CD19 CAR–T cell therapy in non-Hodg-
kin’s lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
(5–9). Emerging data from these studies suggest that robust prolif-
eration of transferred CAR–T cells in the recipient correlates with 
clinical response and that prolonged in vivo persistence of func-
tional CAR–T cells may be necessary to prevent disease relapse. 
The administration of CD19 CAR–T cells and their subsequent 
expansion can be associated with cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS), characterized by hyperpyrexia, hypotension, capillary leak, 
neurotoxicity, and death in severe cases (3, 4, 7, 9, 10). The factors 
that determine CAR–T cell expansion and persistence in vivo, the 
durability of antitumor responses, and toxicities have been chal-
lenging to define in initial studies in part because of the wide vari-
BACKGROUND. T cells that have been modified to express a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) have antitumor 
activity in B cell malignancies; however, identification of the factors that determine toxicity and efficacy of these T cells has been 
challenging in prior studies in which phenotypically heterogeneous CAR–T cell products were prepared from unselected T cells.
METHODS. We conducted a clinical trial to evaluate CD19 CAR–T cells that were manufactured from defined CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cell subsets and administered in a defined CD4+:CD8+ composition to adults with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia after 
lymphodepletion chemotherapy.
RESULTS. The defined composition product was remarkably potent, as 27 of 29 patients (93%) achieved BM remission, 
as determined by flow cytometry. We established that high CAR–T cell doses and tumor burden increase the risks of 
severe cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Moreover, we identified serum biomarkers that allow testing of early 
intervention strategies in patients at the highest risk of toxicity. Risk-stratified CAR–T cell dosing based on BM disease burden 
decreased toxicity. CD8+ T cell–mediated anti-CAR transgene product immune responses developed after CAR–T cell infusion 
in some patients, limited CAR–T cell persistence, and increased relapse risk. Addition of fludarabine to the lymphodepletion 
regimen improved CAR–T cell persistence and disease-free survival.
CONCLUSION. Immunotherapy with a CAR–T cell product of defined composition enabled identification of factors that 
correlated with CAR–T cell expansion, persistence, and toxicity and facilitated design of lymphodepletion and CAR–T cell 
dosing strategies that mitigated toxicity and improved disease-free survival.

B-ALL. The 30 patients who proceeded to lymphodepletion 
chemotherapy and CD19 CAR–T cell infusion had previously 
received a median of 3 prior intensive chemotherapy regimens 
(range 1–11), and 11 patients had relapsed at a median of 7 months 
(range 1–28) after prior allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplan-
tation (HCT) (Table 1). Before lymphodepletion and CAR–T cell 
therapy, all patients had detectable disease in BM, extramedul-
lary sites, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Twenty-nine of 30 patients 
had detectable leukemic blasts in the BM (median 21.0%, range 
0.014%–97.0%, n = 29), and 7 patients had extramedullary dis-
ease, including 5 with bulky extramedullary disease. Leukemia 
was detected by flow cytometry in the CSF from 2 patients, one 
of whom had no other identified site of disease. The other 28 
patients were negative for leukemic blasts in the CSF at evalua-
tion before CAR–T cell infusion.
Prior to leukapheresis, we evaluated the absolute counts 
and proportions of TN, TCM, and TEM/EMRA (where TEMRA indicates 
CD45RA+ effector memory) cells within the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell 
subsets in the blood of each B-ALL patient (Figure 1, B–E). B-ALL 
patients had lower numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared 
with healthy individuals (Figure 1C), and the CD4+:CD8+ T cell 
ratio was highly variable within the patient population (median 
1.19; range 0.27–8.89). Importantly, we found marked hetero-
geneity in the percentages of TEM/EMRA cells within the CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cell subsets in B-ALL patients (Figure 1, D and E; CD4+ 
TEM/EMRA, range 7.8%–57.5%; CD8+ TEM/EMRA, range 8.5%–87.4%). 
These data suggest that, particularly in B-ALL patients who have 
high fractions of TEM/EMRA or a disparate ratio of CD4+:CD8+ T cells 
in blood, the ability to manufacture a CD19 CAR–T cell product 
of consistent potency may be enhanced by selection of defined 
T cell subsets from the leukapheresis product for CAR gene 
transfer and formulation of the CAR–T cell product in a defined 
CD4+:CD8+ CAR–T cell ratio.
CD19 CAR–T cell manufacturing. There were no serious 
adverse events in the 32 patients who underwent leukapher-
esis. Highly enriched CD4+ T cells were isolated for CAR–T cell 
manufacturing from all patients (CD3+CD4+ T cell purity 97.2%; 
range 48.5%–99.6%; n = 32). Our preclinical studies had suggest-
ed that infusion of CD8+ TCM CAR–T cells combined with CD4+ 
CAR–T cells might provide optimal antitumor efficacy and that 
an absolute CD8+ TCM cell count of 20/μl or more on a screen-
ing assay was necessary for efficient selection of CD8+ TCM cells 
using a sequential 2-step enrichment that involved depletion of 
CD4+CD14+CD45RA+ cells followed by selection of CD62L+ cells 
(ref. 18 and Supplemental Figure 1, A and B; supplemental mate-
rial available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI85309DS1). 
Enrichment of CD8+ TCM cells using this approach was success-
ful in 18 of 19 patients. For the patients undergoing CD8+ TCM 
selection, the frequency of CD3+CD8+ T cells with a CD45RA–
CD62L+ phenotype increased from 13.2% (range 1.12%–41.8%) 
in the leukapheresis product to 72.2% (range 24.5%–90.2%) after 
the 2-step enrichment. CD3+CD8+ T cells made up 17.4% (range 
0.86%–66.9%) of the CD4–CD14–CD45RA–CD62L+ product, 
with the remainder being CD13+CD15+CD16+ myeloid cells and 
CD13+CD123+CD16– basophils (Supplemental Figure 1, B and C). 
Fourteen patients, including one who had an unsuccessful CD8+ 
TCM selection, had profound lymphopenia (CD4+, median 150 
ation in CAR–T cell doses administered to patients, differences in 
the phenotypic composition of T cells isolated from patients for 
genetic modification and in the infused products, and differences 
in chemotherapy regimens administered to patients to provide 
lymphodepletion before CAR–T cells are infused (11).
Prior work has demonstrated that human CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells comprise functionally and transcriptionally distinct subsets 
that differ in their capacities to proliferate and persist in vivo after 
in vitro expansion and adoptive transfer (12–16). Using a preclinical 
model, we demonstrated that human CD19 CAR–T cells that were 
manufactured from purified CD8+ or CD4+ central memory T cells 
(TCM cells) or naive T cells (TN cells) were more potent in elimina-
tion of CD19+ tumors from immunodeficient mice compared with 
CD19 CAR–T cells that were manufactured from effector memory 
T cells (TEM cells) (17). Synergistic enhancement in potency could 
be achieved by infusion of a defined ratio of CD19 CAR–T cells 
derived from CD8+ TCM cells and CD4+ T cells. These results sug-
gested that selecting defined subsets of T cells from patients with 
B-ALL prior to transduction and formulating therapeutic CAR–T 
cell products of uniform composition might provide reproducible 
potency in clinical therapy and facilitate determining potential 
correlations between cell dose and efficacy or toxicity. Thus, we 
initiated a phase I/II clinical trial in patients with refractory B-ALL 
in which CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets were separately modified 
to express a CD19-targeted CAR incorporating 4-1BB and CD3ζ 
signaling domains, formulated in a defined ratio of CD4+:CD8+ 
CAR–T cells, and administered in a dose-escalation/deescalation 
format after lymphodepletion with a cyclophosphamide-based 
(Cy-based) regimen, alone or with fludarabine (Flu).
The eligibility criteria for this study did not exclude any 
patient based on the absolute lymphocyte count or on a predeter-
mined measurement of the ability of the patient’s T cells to expand 
after activation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads. Our data show that a 
therapeutic CAR–T cell product could be manufactured from all 
patients that enrolled in the study and that formulation of CAR–T 
cells in a defined composition was feasible in a majority of these 
heavily pretreated patients. We observed reproducible in vivo pro-
liferation of CAR–T cells and antitumor activity, and low doses 
(2 × 105/kg) of the defined-composition CAR–T cell product were 
remarkably potent for inducing CR without a high rate of toxic-
ity in patients with a high tumor burden. We demonstrate that a T 
cell–mediated immune response specific for epitopes encoded by 
the CAR transgene can develop in some patients who receive Cy 
lymphodepletion and limit the persistence of transferred CAR–T 
cells. The persistence of CAR–T cells, duration of remission, and 
disease-free survival (DFS) were improved by the addition of Flu 
to the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen.
Results
Patient characteristics. Thirty-two consecutive patients with 
relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-ALL and a median age of 40 years 
(range 20–73) that enrolled in the study had CD19 CAR–T cells 
manufactured (Figure 1A). Two patients developed complications 
related to prior treatment during CAR–T cell manufacturing that 
excluded them from receiving lymphodepletion chemotherapy 
and CAR–T cells. One of these patients died due to progressive 
B-ALL, and the other is alive, at this writing, with persistent

from bulk CD8+ T cells contained a lower fraction of CD45RA–
CD62L– cells than those manufactured from CD8+ TCM cells.
Assessment of toxicity following administration of CD19 CAR–T 
cells. The study was designed to evaluate the safety of 3 DLs (2 × 105/ 
kg; 2 × 106/kg; and 2 × 107/kg) of CAR–T cells administered 48 to 
96 hours after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Serious acute tox-
icity in the first 2 hours after CAR–T cell infusion was not observed 
at any CAR–T cell dose. Patients developed the toxicities expected 
with cytotoxic chemotherapy, including BM suppression, alopecia, 
mild mucositis, and neutropenic fever. The most common toxic-
ity that was observed in the first 14 days after CAR–T cell infusion 
was CRS, characterized by fever and/or hypotension and elevated 
serum levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ. Two patients died due to toxicity 
after CAR–T cell infusion: one developed severe CRS (sCRS) and 
multiorgan failure that was unresponsive to tocilizumab, etan-
ercept, and corticosteroids, and another patient who developed 
transient sCRS died 122 days after CAR–T cell infusion with irre-

9–458 cells/μl, n = 14) due to previous therapy and/or had circu-
lating CD19+ blasts and had enrichment of CD8+ T cells without 
CD62L selection. The median CD3+CD8+ T cell purity after CD8+ 
selection was 84% (range 36.1%–95.7%, n = 12).
The selected CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were lentivirally trans-
duced to express the CD19 CAR and a truncated human epider-
mal growth factor receptor (EGFRt) that enabled identification of 
transduced cells by flow cytometry using the anti-EGFR mono-
clonal antibody cetuximab. Transduced EGFRt+ CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells were enriched during culture by a single stimulation with 
irradiated CD19+ lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) (n = 27; Supple-
mental Figure 1, D and E). The median frequency of EGFRt+ 
CAR–T cells within the CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ subsets in the 
products at release for infusion was, respectively, 79.7% (range 
50.0%–95.9%) and 84.2% (range 13.0%–95.6%). The infused 
CD3+CD4+EGFRt+ and CD3+CD8+EGFRt+ CAR–T cells were pre-
dominantly CD45RA–CD62L+ and CD45RA–CD62L– (Supplemen-

the resolution of CRS. No patients developed grade 1 to 2 neuro-
toxicity. The clinical presentation of neurotoxicity was variable 
and manifested as mild to severe encephalopathy, focal neuro-
logic deficits, and in 3 patients, generalized seizures. Five patients 
with grade of 3 or higher neurotoxicity developed transient dis-
seminated intravascular coagulation. With the exception of one 
patient who developed severe irreversible neurologic deficits and 
subsequently died 122 days after CAR–T cell infusion, the neuro-
logic symptoms and signs completely resolved over days to weeks.
Depletion of normal CD19+ B cells, consistent with the in vivo 
presence of functional CD19 CAR–T cells, was noted in 29 of 29 
patients on or before day 28, but hypogammaglobulinemia and 
late opportunistic infections were not prominent during the period 
versible neurologic toxicity. The first 2 patients treated at dose-
level 3 (DL3) developed severe toxicities, including one of the 
patients who died. DL3 was therefore deemed too toxic, and no 
further patients were treated at this DL. Overall, 25 of 30 patients 
developed CRS between 6 hours and 9 days after CAR–T cell infu-
sion, and 7 of these 25 patients had sCRS requiring ICU care. Of 
the 28 patients treated at DL1 and DL2, dexamethasone alone 
 
(n = 3) or with tocilizumab (n = 7) was used to treat CRS, result-
ing in prompt resolution of fever and hypotension in all patients 
(Supplemental Table 1).
Severe neurotoxicity (National Cancer Institute [NCI] com-
mon terminology criteria for adverse events [CTCAE] v4.03 grade 
≥ 3) occurred in 15 of 30 patients either concurrent with or after

of follow-up. A difference in the rate or severity of toxicity in the 
11 patients with a prior allogeneic HCT was not apparent. CAR–T 
cells were manufactured from the engrafted donor T cells obtained 
from the patients after transplant, and it is notable that none of 
the 11 patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 
after CAR–T cell therapy. One patient who had stage 1 acute skin 
GVHD before study enrollment developed chronic GVHD requir-
ing corticosteroid therapy 3 months after CAR–T cell infusion.
Correlates of CRS and neurotoxicity. CRS is initiated by activa-
tion and proliferation of CAR–T cells after recognition of CD19+ 
target cells and is characterized by elevated serum levels of IL-6 
and IFN-γ (2). We observed significantly higher peak IL-6 and 
IFN-γ levels after CAR–T cell infusion in patients with high BM 
tumor burden (Figure 2A) and in those requiring ICU care com-
pared with those that did not (Figure 2B), and the need for ICU 
correlated with a higher percentage of BM blasts before lym-

phodepletion chemotherapy (Figure 2, C and D). We used flow 
cytometry to identify EGFRt+ CAR–T cells and determine their 
frequency in peripheral blood obtained at prescribed intervals 
after infusion. With the exception of the patient who died on 
day 3 after CAR–T cell infusion prior to peak CAR–T cell expan-
sion, no patients with a peak CD4+ EGFRt+ CAR–T cell count of 
less than 9.8 cells/μl or CD8+ EGFRt+ count of less than 15 cells/
μl required ICU care, whereas 6 of 15 (40%) patients with a peak 
CD4+ EGFRt+ count of 9.8 or more cells/μl and 6 of 21 (29%) with 
a peak CD8+ EGFRt+ count of 15 or more cells/μl required ICU. 
Elevations of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin, which 
are more readily measured by clinical laboratories than serum 
cytokines, also correlated with BM disease burden (Figure 2E) and 
with the occurrence of sCRS requiring ICU care (Figure 2F). sCRS 
was more likely to occur in patients with peak CRP concentrations 
of 150 or more mg/l (7 of 13) and/or with serum ferritin concentra-
tions of 10,000 or more ng/ml (5 of 10). Ferritin and CRP levels 
declined after tocilizumab or corticosteroid therapy.
The pathogenesis of neurotoxicity developing after CD19 
CAR–T cell therapy is poorly defined. In our study, all patients 
who developed neurotoxicity had evidence of CRS, and peak 
levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, ferritin, and CRP were significantly higher

neurotoxicity compared with patients who developed grade 3 
neurotoxicity (Figure 3E). Univariate logistic analysis suggested 
that IL-6 concentration is a predictor of patients who are likely 
to develop grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity (odds ratio 11.0 [95% 
CI: 1.4–84.3], P = 0.02) (Figure 3F). Stepwise multivariate logis-
tic regression analysis incorporating day 1 serum IL-6 concen-
tration, infused CAR–T cell dose, lymphodepletion chemother-
apy regimen, and the fraction of BM represented by normal and 
abnormal CD19+ cells indicated that serum IL-6 concentration 
of more than 30 pg/ml on day 1 (P = 0.02) and the total number 
of CD19+ cells in BM before therapy (P = 0.06) are independent 
predictors of subsequent development of grade 3 or higher neu-
rotoxicity. Of note, serum IL-6 of more than 30 pg/ml on day 1 
identified all patients in our study who subsequently developed 
grade 4 or higher neurotoxicity. Thus, evaluation of serum IL-6 
in patients who developed grade 3 or higher neurotoxicity (Fig-
ure 3, A and B). The fever and hypotension that accompany CRS 
were responsive to administration of corticosteroids and/or 
tocilizumab, but neurotoxicity was less responsive to these inter-
ventions. We evaluated serum levels of IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α 
on the first day after CAR–T cell infusion to determine wheth-
er these might serve as biomarkers to identify patients at high 
risk for subsequent neurotoxicity and ICU care. We found that 
IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α levels on the first day after CAR–T cell 
infusion were significantly higher in patients who subsequently 
developed severe (grade ≥ 3) neurotoxicity compared with those 
who did not (Figure 3C) and were also higher in patients who 
required ICU care (Figure 3D). Moreover, serum IL-6 and IFN-γ 
concentrations on day 1 after CAR–T cell infusion were signifi-
cantly higher in patients who subsequently developed grade 4

In vivo expansion and persistence of CD19 CAR–T cells. The pro-
liferation, migration to sites of tumor, and persistence of CAR–T 
cells in vivo after adoptive transfer are likely to be critical deter-
minants of antitumor efficacy, and the kinetics of CAR–T cell 
expansion may in part dictate the risk of serious toxicity. CAR–T 
cells were detected by flow cytometry in the blood at 1 or more 
time points after infusion in all patients (Figure 4A). CAR–T cells 
were also present in BM obtained at response evaluation in 22 of 
27 patients from whom the BM was examined for the presence of 
CAR–T cells and in the CSF of 6 of the 8 patients from whom sam-
ples were obtained for clinical indications (Figure 4B).
Several factors could contribute to CAR–T cell expansion 
and persistence in vivo, including cell product composition, cell 
dose, tumor burden, and the conditioning regimen used to pro-
vide lymphodepletion. Previous studies at other centers in which 
CD19 CAR–T cells were manufactured from T cells of undefined 
composition did not identify a clear correlation between the 
concentration early after CAR–T cell infusion might be used to 
identify patients at high risk of severe neurotoxicity to evaluate 
early intervention approaches.
Because the occurrence of toxicity correlated with BM tumor 
burden and sCRS was noted in patients treated at a higher CAR–T 
cell dose, we initiated risk-adapted CAR–T cell dosing during the 
course of the study, in which patients with greater than 20% BM 
blasts received a low dose of CAR–T cells (2 × 105 EGFRt+ cells/
kg) and those with 20% or less BM blasts received a higher dose 
of CAR–T cells (2 × 106 EGFRt+ cells/kg). Prior to incorporation of 
risk-adapted CAR–T cell dosing, 6 of 6 patients with high–tumor 
burden B-ALL who were treated at DL2 or DL3 (≥ 2 × 106 EGFRt+ 
cells/kg) required ICU care after CAR–T cell therapy, and all 6 
patients developed severe neurotoxicity (median grade 4). In con-
trast, only 1 of 10 patients with high–tumor burden B-ALL who 
were treated with risk-adapted dosing at DL1 required ICU care, 
and only 5 of 10 developed neurotoxicity (median grade 3).
Figure 6. Failure to achieve engraftment of CAR–T cells after second infusions. Patients who had persistent MRD after the first CAR–T cell infusion or 
subsequently relapsed after attaining a CR (n = 5) received a second infusion of CAR–T cells at an equivalent (n = 1) or 10-fold higher EGFRt+ dose (n = 4) 
compared with their first infusion. Engraftment after each infusion was analyzed by QPCR to detect a transgene vector sequence. Each graph shows the 
number of copies of integrated transgene (WPRE copies/μg DNA, n = 1; FlapEF1α copies/μg DNA, n = 4) detected in PBMCs collected at the indicated times 
after the first and second CAR–T cell infusions. The times and doses of the first (blue) and second (red) CAR–T cell infusions are noted on the graphs.

CD8+ T cells selected from this patient to expand in culture. The 
other patient had 0.016% abnormal BM blasts by flow cytometry 
before CAR–T cell infusion, received CAR–T cells at DL1, and had 
poor in vivo CAR–T cell expansion (peak CD8+ EGFRt+ 0.97/μl, 
peak CD4+ EGFRt+ 0.42/μl). This patient subsequently under-
went allogeneic HCT, but relapsed after HCT and was reenrolled 
in the CAR–T cell study. The patient achieved a CR after being 
retreated with CAR–T cells that were manufactured from T cells 
collected from the patient after allogeneic HCT and administered 
at a higher dose (DL2).
Molecular studies of BM, including quantitative PCR (QPCR), 
FISH, and conventional karyotyping, were negative in all patients 
who achieved remission by flow cytometry and had an identified 
B-ALL–associated genomic mutation, except for 2 patients — one 
with a persistent t(4;11) who subsequently relapsed with a clon-
ally related CD19– acute myeloid leukemia and a second patient 
with BCR-ABL transcripts identified at the limit of detection by 
QPCR (Table 1). Thus, 25 of 29 patients (86%) achieved CR with-
out evidence of MRD by flow cytometry and conventional karyo-
typing, FISH, or QPCR in those with an identified B-ALL–associ-
ated genomic mutation. Deep sequencing of the immunoglobulin 
heavy locus (IGH) genes in BM samples from 17 patients in whom 
we identified a neoplastic clonal IGH sequence showed that 10 
(59%) had no detectable disease using an assay with a sensitivity 
to detect 1 malignant blast in 1,000,000 nucleated cells. In addi-
tion to the efficacy in eliminating BM- and blood-based leukemic 
blasts, extramedullary disease identified by PET-CT scan was 
eliminated in 6 of 7 patients after CAR–T cell therapy (Supple-
mental Figure 3). We did not observe a difference in response rate 
between patients who had or had not previously undergone allo-
geneic HCT (HCT group, 10/11 CR, 1/11 BM MRD; no HCT group, 
15/19 CR, 3/19 BM MRD, 1/19 died before evaluation), demon-
strating that CD19 CAR–T cells of defined composition can be 
successfully manufactured and administered to patients following 
allogeneic HCT. Thus, the data show a high rate of CR with CAR–T 
cells of defined CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratio in patients with refractory 
B-ALL, including those with extramedullary disease or with leuke-
mia relapse after allogeneic HCT.
Transgene immune responses limit persistence and efficacy of sec-
ond CAR–T cell infusions. Five patients treated in our study with 
CAR–T cells after Cy-based lymphodepletion had persistent leu-
kemia or subsequently relapsed and received a second infusion 
of CAR–T cells at the same (n = 1) or a 10-fold higher dose (n = 
4) after no lymphodepletion (n = 1) or lymphodepletion with Cy 
and Flu (n = 3) or clofarabine (n = 1). Despite evidence of CAR–T 
cell proliferation after the first infusion and the same or higher BM 
blast count at the time of second infusion, there was no expansion 
or persistence of CAR–T cells or demonstrable antitumor activ-
ity in any of these 5 patients (Figure 6). We considered that these 
patients might have mounted a T cell immune response directed 
at epitopes encoded by the CAR transgene after the first infusion, 
since the CD19-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) is 
of murine origin and there are unique fusion sites between com-
ponents of the CAR. To evaluate whether a cytotoxic CD8+ T 
cell response to autologous CAR–T cells was present, we used a 
modification of an in vitro assay we previously reported to analyze 
transgene product immunogenicity (19, 20). We detected CAR-
infused CAR–T cell dose and the absolute number of CAR–T cells 
detected in vivo in the recipient (2–4). We found that administer-
ing a consistent CAR–T cell product of a defined CD4+:CD8+ T 
cell ratio to all patients revealed a relationship between cell dose 
and the peak number of CD4+ and CD8+ CAR–T cells. Prior to 
commencing risk-adapted CAR–T cell dosing based on BM tumor 
burden, we found that patients who received CAR–T cells at 
DL2 had an earlier and higher peak in absolute CD4+ and CD8+ 
EGFRt+ CAR–T cell counts in blood compared with those who 
received DL1 (Figure 4C). At both DLs, the absolute number of 
CD8+ CAR–T cells was higher than that of CD4+ CAR–T cells at 
the peak of expansion, despite CD4+ and CD8+ CAR–T cells hav-
ing been infused at the same dose.
The burden of CD19+ cells in the patient could also affect 
CAR–T cell numbers either by inducing their proliferation or 
resulting in activation-induced cell death. Stratifying patients 
treated prior to risk-adapted dosing based on the proportion of 
CD19+ leukemia blasts in the BM showed that patients with a 
higher percentage of blasts in the BM had significantly higher 
CD4+ and CD8+ CAR–T cell counts in the blood at the peak of 
expansion and better persistence at day 28 after infusion (Figure 
5A). The accumulation of CD4+ and CD8+ CAR–T cells in vivo 
could occur as a result of expansion of a diverse repertoire of poly-
clonal T cells derived from the transduced T cell population or 
the expansion of few highly proliferative T cell clonotypes with a 
proliferative and/or survival advantage. To distinguish these pos-
sibilities, we performed high-throughput sequencing of the T cell 
receptor β (TCRB) genes utilized by flow-sorted CD4+ and CD8+ 
EGFRt+ CAR–T cells obtained from the infused CAR–T cell prod-
ucts of 5 patients, at the peak of CAR–T cell expansion in vivo, 
and at one or more later time points. Both at the peak of expan-
sion and at later times after elimination of detectable leukemia, 
the CD4+ and CD8+ CAR–T cells present in vivo were polyclonal, 
and multiple distinct TCRB clonotypes that were identified in the 
infusion product were observed in the CAR–T cell population in 
the patient (Figure 5B). Together, these results demonstrate that 
the infusion of CAR–T cell products comprising CD8+ and CD4+ T 
cells in a defined ratio results in predictable polyclonal prolifera-
tion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with kinetics that are affected 
by both CAR–T cell dose and tumor burden.
Clinical response. Twenty-nine of 30 patients who received 
CAR–T cells survived for more than 21 days and were evaluat-
ed for disease response by BM aspirate and biopsy. All patients 
(100%) had no detectable leukemia in the BM by morphology, 
and in 27 of 29 patients (93%), leukemia was undetectable by 
high-resolution flow cytometry (Table 1). Of the 27 patients who 
achieved BM remission by flow cytometry, one initially had mini-
mal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry at a level of 0.08% 
identified on day 28 after CAR–T cell infusion; however, in the 
absence of any additional antileukemic therapy, a subsequent 
BM biopsy on day 83 after CAR–T cell infusion showed no evi-
dence of disease by flow cytometry, karyotyping, or FISH studies 
using probes that were informative for the patient’s disease. The 
2 patients who did not achieve remission by flow cytometry had a 
low level (< 5%) of abnormal BM blasts by flow cytometry before 
CAR–T cell infusion. One of these patients received a cell product 
with a CD4+:CD8+ CAR–T cell ratio of 66:1 due to failure of the

We enrolled 32 patients and, importantly, did not exclude any 
patient based on a low absolute lymphocyte count, the presence 
of circulating blasts, or the results of a screening test to ensure the 
patient had sufficient T cells capable of proliferating to CD3/CD28 
stimulation. Therefore, our study was not biased due to exclusion 
of patients with poor lymphocyte numbers and function. A clini-
cal trial of CD19 CAR–T cell therapy for pediatric B-ALL excluded 
24% of patients due to the failure of T cells to meet predefined cri-
teria for in vitro proliferation (21).
A primary objective of the study was to assess the feasibility 
of selecting CD4+ and CD8+ subsets for manufacturing of CAR–T 
cells and formulating the cell product in a consistent 1:1 ratio of 
CD4+ and CD8+ CAR–T cells. CD8+ TCM cells and their progeny 
have been shown to have stemness and to exhibit superior per-
sistence compared with TEM cells after adoptive transfer, suggest-
ing a potential advantage of this subset for providing long-term 
persistence (12, 22). Our data show that in heavily pretreated 
B-ALL patients, the absolute CD8+ TCM counts were sufficient for 
selection and manufacturing of a CAR–T cell product in 16 of 30 
patients and that selection of bulk CD8+ T cells was feasible in the 
remaining 14 patients. Thus, a cell product comprising CD4+ and 
CD8+ CAR–T cells was successfully manufactured and infused to 
all patients with refractory B-ALL, and the 1:1 ratio of CD4+:CD8+ 
CAR–T cells was achieved in 27 of 30 patients.
The high overall rate of BM remission of 93% by flow cytome-
try in this study and differences in lymphodepletion regimens and 
infused cell doses do not allow comparison of the efficacy of CAR–
T cell products manufactured from CD8+ TCM cells or from bulk 
CD8+ T cells. Analysis of differences in long-term persistence of 
cell products that were selected for CD8+ TCM or bulk CD8+ T cells 
in our study was further complicated by our findings that immune-
mediated rejection of CAR–T cells occurs in some patients, which 
may provide an explanation for the loss of CAR–T cells observed 
in a subset of patients in other studies (1–4). Nevertheless, our 
data demonstrate that performing cell selections from heavily 
pretreated B-ALL patients is feasible and that formulating CD19 
CAR–T cells in a defined CD4+:CD8+ CAR–T cell ratio, either from 
a starting population of isolated CD8+ TCM or bulk CD8+ cells, can 
provide a remarkably effective CAR–T cell product at cell doses 
that are 5- to 100-fold lower than those used to treat a majority 
of patients in other trials (1–4). The 93% remission rate by flow 
cytometry and 86% MRD-negative CR rate in our study compares 
very favorably to that reported by others in which CAR–T cells of 
undefined composition were manufactured using CD19 CARs 
that incorporate either a 4-1BB costimulatory domain (children 
and young adults, 79%) or a CD28 costimulatory domain (adults, 
75%; children and young adults, 60%) (1–4).
An important predictor of the efficacy of CD19 CAR–T cells is 
their ability to expand in vivo in response to recognition of CD19+ 
target cells, and the patients that failed to respond in prior stud-
ies typically had poor accumulation of CAR–T cells in vivo. The 
infusion of CAR–T cell products comprising a uniform ratio of 
CD4+:CD8+ CAR–T cells demonstrated a correlation between cell 
dose and earlier and higher peak expansion of clonally diverse 
CAR–T cells, a finding that has not been reported in studies in 
which CAR–T cells were manufactured and infused without 
consideration of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio. Independent of cell dose, 
specific T cell responses in all 5 patients in whom CAR–T cells 
failed to persist after the second infusion, and epitope mapping 
in 1 patient identified immunogenic epitopes within the murine 
FMC63 scFv (Supplemental Figure 4).
Addition of Flu to Cy lymphodepletion improves persistence of 
CAR–T cells. Ten of 12 patients (83%) who received lymphodeple-
tion with Cy alone or with etoposide followed by CAR–T cell infu-
sion and who survived until disease restaging achieved BM CR by 
flow cytometry. We observed recovery of endogenous B cells in 8 
of these patients by day 90 after CAR–T cells, and 7 patients sub-
sequently relapsed (Figure 7A). One of the patients relapsed with 
CD19– leukemia, but the remaining 6 relapses were CD19+, sug-
gesting a loss of CAR–T cell immunosurveillance. Indeed, in 5 of 
the 6 patients with CD19+ relapse, a loss of CAR–T cell engraft-
ment in blood was shown by PCR analysis for transgene sequenc-
es, and an immune response to the CAR transgene product was 
detected in all of these patients.
To determine whether the development of an immune 
response to CAR–T cells might be prevented or delayed by inten-
sifying the lymphodepletion regimen, we administered Cy/Flu to 
17 subsequent patients prior to CAR–T cell infusion and compared 
CAR–T cell expansion and persistence to those of prior patients 
who received Cy without Flu. Patients with similar BM blast per-
centage who received Cy/Flu and DL2 of CAR–T cells had a sig-
nificantly higher peak of expansion and numbers of CD4+ and 
CD8+ EGFRt+ CAR–T cells at day 28 than those treated at DL2 who 
did not receive Flu (Figure 7, B and C). Sixteen of 17 patients who 
received Cy/Flu lymphodepletion and DL1 or DL2 of CAR–T cells 
had a CR. Three of 4 patients who received lymphodepletion with 
Cy or Cy/etoposide and had no detectable disease by IGH sequenc-
ing ultimately relapsed, whereas 0 of 6 patients who received Cy/
Flu lymphodepletion and eliminated the malignant clone by IGH 
sequencing relapsed. Although follow-up of the cohort of patients 
who received Cy/Flu lymphodepletion is short, the DFS of this 
group is superior to those that did not receive Flu (Figure 7D).
Discussion
Previous clinical trials have reported a high rate of morphologic 
remission in small numbers of adult and pediatric patients with 
B-ALL treated with CD19 CAR–T cells (2–4). This approach repre-
sents an important therapeutic advance; however, much remains 
to be learned regarding the optimal lymphodepletion regimens 
and cell dose(s) to eradicate MRD, the prediction and manage-
ment of toxicities, and the mechanisms of relapse. Systematically 
studying these issues has been challenging in part because of 
the differences in the phenotypic composition of the CAR–T cell 
products that were administered to individual patients in prior 
trials (2–4). Our data show that heavily pretreated adult B-ALL 
patients have highly variable numbers and proportions of CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cell subsets in peripheral blood. Preclinical stud-
ies provide support for improving potency and predictability of 
therapeutic efficacy by manufacturing CD19 CAR–T cell prod-
ucts of defined CD4+ and CD8+ subset composition (17). Here, 
we describe what we believe is the first clinical trial that assesses 
the feasibility of selecting and engineering defined T cell subsets 
with a CD19 CAR and formulating a cell product of a defined ratio 
of CD4+:CD8+ CAR–T cells.

within hours and discharge from the ICU within 1 to 2 days in 
most patients. Neurotoxicity was manifest by signs that included 
encephalopathy and seizures and focal deficits; in some patients, 
it followed a time course that was distinct from that of CRS. Neu-
rologic signs often reached maximal severity after resolution of 
CRS and were not clearly responsive to intervention with tocili-
zumab or corticosteroids at either low or high doses.
We investigated whether surrogate markers of systemic 
inflammation could identify patients with sCRS and potentially be 
used to guide intervention to either suppress cytokine release or 
eliminate CAR–T cells in the event of severe toxicity. Serum fer-
ritin and CRP concentrations correlated with the severity of acute 
toxicity and declined in response to tocilizumab or corticosteroids; 
however, additional data are needed to determine their utility in 
monitoring the response to CRS therapy. Severe hyperferritinemia 
(> 20,000 ng/ml) is not typically observed in infections even in 
heavily transfused patients (24) and could serve as a useful tool in 
distinguishing sCRS from other causes of fever after CAR–T cell 
infusion. Serum concentrations of IL-6 and IFN-γ also correlated 
with the severity of toxicity and had predictive value, with high 
concentrations within 1 day after CAR–T cell infusion identify-
ing patients who subsequently developed severe neurotoxicity. 
If these findings are confirmed in additional patients, analysis of 
serum IL-6 and IFN-γ concentrations early after CAR–T cell infu-
sion might be employed to identify patients at risk of life-threaten-
ing toxicity in whom early and aggressive intervention to mitigate 
immune cell cytokine production might be evaluated.
Although CAR–T cells induced CR in a majority of patients in 
our study, disease relapse occurred in a subset of patients. Leu-
kemia relapse after CAR–T cells could be classified into 2 distinct 
phenotypes: those with loss of the CD19 target antigen as observed 
by others (25) and those that remained CD19+ and relapsed in a 
manner associated with loss of CD19 CAR–T cells in blood. Two 
patients in our study relapsed with CD19– disease, 1 with B-ALL 
and 1 with a myeloid phenotype switch. CD19+ relapse occurred 
exclusively in patients who did not have persisting CAR–T cells 
in blood; retreatment of these patients with a second CAR–T cell 
infusion did not result in CAR–T cell proliferation, persistence, or 
antitumor activity. We demonstrated that the loss of CAR–T cells 
was due to development of CD8+ T cell immunity to the CAR trans-
gene product. Because all CD19 CARs used in reported clinical tri-
als of CD19 CAR–T cell therapy incorporate a murine scFv, these 
data provide one potential mechanism for the loss of CAR–T cells 
observed in other trials (2–8, 23, 26). A solution that may reduce 
immunogenicity of the construct would be to incorporate a human 
rather than murine CD19-specific scFv into the CAR construct.
Our trial investigated whether the addition of Flu to the lym-
phodepletion regimen could delay or abrogate development of 
anti-CAR immune responses and improve CAR–T cell expansion 
and persistence. We noted remarkably higher CD4+ and CD8+ 
CAR–T cell proliferation and persistence in patients who received 
Flu compared with those who did not receive Flu. The mechanisms 
by which Flu increased CAR–T cell accumulation and persistence 
could include greater lymphodepletion, resulting in increased lev-
els of homeostatic cytokines that support T cell proliferation and 
survival, delaying or preventing the anti-CAR immune respons-
es and potentially modifying the tumor microenvironment to 
tumor burden was an important factor in driving CAR–T cell 
expansion, and patients with 5% or greater BM blasts had on aver-
age a 100-fold greater expansion of both CD8+ and CD4+ CAR–T 
cells than patients with less than 5% blasts. Administering a sin-
gle low dose of 2 × 105 CAR–T cells/kg of a defined CD4+:CD8+ T 
cell ratio was effective in inducing a CR in all patients with high 
BM tumor burden. The high potency of the CAR–T cell products 
was not limited to elimination of BM disease, and bulky extra-
medullary disease identified by PET/CT scan was also eradicated 
in all but 1 patient. Seven of 17 patients (41%) who achieved BM 
CR by flow cytometry had detectable copies of the neoplastic IGH 
sequence in BM early after CAR–T cell infusion; however, the 
detection of nonviable leukemic tissue renders the significance 
of this finding uncertain. Only 4 of these 7 patients subsequently 
relapsed; 2 of these had CD19-negative leukemia. Three patients 
had persistent BM disease detected by flow cytometry at the first 
evaluation after receiving CAR–T cells; 1 of these subsequently 
achieved CR in the absence of further therapy. Of the 2 patients 
who never achieved BM CR by flow cytometry, 1 received a pre-
dominantly CD4+ CAR–T cell product because we were unable 
to propagate sufficient CD8+ CAR–T cells in culture. The clinical 
outcome in this patient is consistent with our preclinical observa-
tions in Raji tumor–bearing immunodeficient mice that received 
CAR–T cells manufactured from distinct T cell subsets, showing 
reduced potency when either CD8+ or CD4+ CAR–T cells were 
omitted from the formulated product (17). Both of the remain-
ing patients had low tumor burden in the BM before CAR–T cell 
therapy, raising the additional possibility that a higher dose of 
CAR–T cells may be necessary to effectively treat patients with 
low tumor burden, perhaps due to a stochastic failure to receive 
sufficient antigenic stimulation to drive CAR–T cell expansion in 
vivo. Given the high rate of CR in our phase I clinical trial, a larger 
patient cohort will need to be studied to understand the mecha-
nisms responsible for failure to achieve remission.
Although CD19 CAR–T cells are therapeutically effective in 
patients with relapsed and refractory B-ALL, significant toxici-
ties have occurred in all studies, highlighting the need to improve 
the therapeutic index (2–4, 23). In our study, severe toxicity due 
to CAR–T cells was predominantly seen in patients with 20% or 
more BM blasts and occurred more often after infusion of higher 
CAR–T cell doses. The severity of toxicity correlated with higher 
peak levels of CD4+ and CD8+ CAR–T cells in blood and higher 
peak IFN-γ and IL-6 concentrations in serum. Taken together, 
these data imply that a variable cell-dosing strategy may prove 
optimal for treating B-ALL with CAR–T cells. Patients with higher 
tumor burden may be best treated initially with a low CAR–T cell 
dose to minimize toxicity, whereas those with lower tumor burden 
may require higher or repeated doses of CAR–T cells to ensure rec-
ognition of a minimal tumor antigen load.
The frequency and clinical spectrum of toxicities occurring 
during CD19 CAR–T cell dose escalation were similar to those in 
other published studies in B-ALL, suggesting that therapy with an 
appropriate dose of a potent defined composition product per se 
does not increase the risk of toxicity. “Classical” CRS with fever, 
capillary leak, and hypotension requiring intensive care was fre-
quent, but responded rapidly to tocilizumab (4–8 mg/kg i.v.) and 
dexamethasone (10 mg bid i.v.), with defervescence occurring

enriched CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets were separately stimulated 
with Dynabeads CD3CD28 CTS paramagnetic beads, transduced 
with the lentivirus encoding the CD19-specific CAR and EGFRt, 
and then cultured in 50 U/ml IL-2. After removal of CD3CD28 
beads, the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were separately stimulated with 
an irradiated CD19+ EBV LCL and cultured in media supplement-
ed with 50 U/ml IL-2. CAR–T cell manufacturing was completed 
within 15 to 20 days after initial bead stimulation. Quality assess-
ments were performed separately on the cultured CD4+ and CD8+ 
CAR–T cells, and the 2 fractions were formulated in a 1:1 ratio of 
CD3+CD4+EGFRt+:CD3+CD8+EGFRt+ cells for infusion.
Lymphodepletion chemotherapy. To deplete endogenous lympho-
cytes prior to adoptive transfer of CAR–T cells, patients received 1 
of 4 chemotherapy regimens: 2–4 g/m2 Cy i.v. on day 1 (n = 11); 2–3 
g/m2 Cy i.v. on day 1 and 100 mg/m2/d etoposide i.v. on days 1 to 3 
 
(n = 2); and 60 mg/kg Cy i.v. on day 1 and 25 mg/m2/d Flu i.v. on either 
days 2 to 4 or days 2 to 6 for patients who had previously received an 
allogeneic HCT and/or were considered at increased risk of toxicity 
(n = 17; Table 1).
CAR–T cell infusion. CD19 CAR–T cells were administered i.v. to 
each patient at or as close as possible to 1 of 3 cell DLs (DL1, 2 × 105 
EGFRt+ cells/kg, n = 13; DL2, 2 × 106 EGFRt+ cells/kg, n = 15; DL3, 2 × 
107 EGFRt+ cells/kg, n = 2) 48 to 96 hours after completing chemother-
apy. CD4+ and CD8+ CAR–T cells were successfully manufactured for 
all patients; however, CAR–T cells from 3 patients were not formulated 
at the defined 1:1 ratio of CD4+:CD8+ T cells due to insufficient growth 
of CD4+ or CD8+ CAR–T cells in culture (DL2, n = 2; DL3, n = 1). Two 
patients received cryopreserved CAR–T cells, whereas the remainder 
were formulated and infused without cryopreservation.
Clinical response assessment. BM aspirates and biopsies were 
obtained from each patient before lymphodepletion chemotherapy and 
approximately 2 to 4 weeks after CAR–T cell infusion. CR was defined as 
absence of immunophenotypically abnormal blasts in the BM by mor-
phology and flow cytometry (limit of detection 1:10,000) and, in those 
patients with a known molecular marker of their leukemia, the absence 
of abnormalities by conventional karyotyping, FISH, or QPCR. When 
available, an aliquot of each BM aspirate was submitted for IGH deep 
sequencing (Adaptive Biotechnologies) from patients who attained CR. 
Patients with CNS leukemia identified before lymphodepletion che-
motherapy underwent CSF sampling for flow cytometry analysis after 
CAR–T cell therapy. Patients with extramedullary disease underwent 
whole-body PET-CT imaging before and after CAR–T cell therapy. 
Toxicity was graded using the NCI CTCAE (v4.03).
Assessment of CAR–T cell persistence. Blood samples were obtained 
from patients before and at intervals after CAR–T cell infusion, and 
flow cytometry was performed to identify CD4+ and CD8+ CAR–T 
cells as viable CD45+CD3+CD4+CD8–EGFRt+ or CD45+CD3+CD4- 
CD8+EGFRt+ events, respectively. Absolute CAR–T cell counts were 
determined by multiplying the percentage of CAR–T cells identified 
by flow cytometry in a CD45+ forward scatter–side scatter (FS-SS) 
lymphocyte gate by the absolute lymphocyte count established by a 
complete blood count (CBC) performed on the same day. To establish 
loss of CAR–T cell persistence due to an anti-CAR transgene immune 
response, we used QPCR to detect integrated transgene sequence.
Evaluation of serum cytokines. Serum concentrations of IFN-γ, 
IL-6, and TNF-α were evaluated by Luminex assay, according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.
improve accessibility and stimulation of CAR–T cells. Consis-
tent with the increased CAR–T cell expansion and persistence in 
patients who received Flu, we noted an improvement in DFS, albe-
it with a relatively short duration of follow-up. Only 1 of 17 patients 
(6%) who received Flu-containing lymphodepletion followed by 
CAR–T cells of defined composition developed CD19+ relapse, 
and this occurred in a patient who, subsequent to achieving remis-
sion after CAR–T cell therapy, had an allogeneic HCT that resulted 
in elimination of the CAR–T cells. While these data are encourag-
ing, additional patient accrual and longer follow-up are required.
We believe this study is the largest reported series of adult 
B-ALL patients treated with CD19 CAR–T cells and the first to 
demonstrate the feasibility of selecting defined T cell subsets for 
CAR engineering and formulation of defined therapeutic products 
for adoptive therapy. Data from this phase I/II trial demonstrate 
potent antitumor activity and reveal dose/response and dose/
toxicity relationships that have not been clearly evident in CAR–T 
cell trials using unselected cells. The development of novel clini-
cal cell isolation technologies that utilize flow cytometry cell sort-
ing or serial column-based selections after labeling with reversibly 
binding reagents may further refine the selection of T cells with a 
complex immunophenotype and facilitate manufacturing defined 
CAR–T cell products for clinical evaluation (18, 27, 28).
Methods
Study design and patient selection. We performed a phase I/II open-label 
trial to evaluate the feasibility of manufacturing CD19 CAR–T cells 
formulated in a defined ratio of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets and to 
assess the safety and efficacy of this therapy in patients with relapsed 
or refractory CD19+ B cell malignancies. This manuscript reports the 
data from B-ALL patients in the study. There were no exclusion crite-
ria for leukapheresis, CD19 CAR–T cell manufacturing, lymphodeple-
tion chemotherapy, or CD19 CAR–T cell infusion based on the abso-
lute lymphocyte count, the results of a test in vitro stimulation, or the 
presence or number of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood. The 
study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01865617).
T cell subset selection and CD19 CAR–T cell manufacturing. Periph-
eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected by leukapher-
esis, and the product was divided into 2 aliquots for enrichment of 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets for CAR–T cell manufacturing (Supple-
mental Figure 1). CD4+ T cells were selected from 1 aliquot by posi-
tive immunomagnetic selection using the CliniMACS CD4 Reagent 
System (Miltenyi Biotec). CD8+ TCM cells were enriched from the sec-
ond aliquot using a 2-step CliniMACS selection procedure involving 
depletion of CD4+, CD14+, and CD45RA+ cells, followed by selection 
of CD62L+ cells from the CD4–CD14–CD45RA- fraction as described 
(18). In patients with an absolute CD8+ TCM cell count of less than 20/
μl, either the CD62L+ selection was omitted or bulk CD8+ T cells were 
selected using the CliniMACS CD8 Reagent System.
We designed a CAR comprising an FMC63-derived CD19-spe-
cific scFv fused to a modified IgG4-hinge spacer, a CD28 transmem-
brane domain, a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and a CD3ζ signaling 
domain (29). To enable precise measurement of transduced CD4+ 
and CD8+ CAR–T cells, we incorporated EGFRt separated from the 
CD19 CAR by a T2A ribosomal skip sequence, which allowed iden-
tification of transduced T cells using flow cytometry after staining 
with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, cetuximab (29, 30). The

Evaluation of transgene immunogenicity. We evaluated CD8+ T cell 
immune responses to the CAR transgene using a modification of an 
assay we previously developed in our lab (19). Cryopreserved PBMCs 
collected from patients before lymphodepletion chemotherapy and 
approximately 4 weeks after CAR–T cell infusion were stimulated twice 
at 7-day intervals with autologous irradiated CAR–T cells and IL-2. The 
preinfusion and postinfusion PBMC cultures were assayed for lysis of 
autologous CAR–T cells and autologous nontransduced T cells in a 
51chromium release assay. An immune response against the CAR trans-
gene was defined as the presence of specific lysis of autologous CAR–T 
cells by postinfusion PBMC cultures, but not of autologous nontrans-
duced T cells or autologous CAR–T cell by preinfusion PBMC cultures.
Statistics. Comparisons of continuous variables between groups 
were made using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The correlation between 
2 continuous variables was assessed using linear regression, with the 
values of some variables replaced by their ranks due to relatively large 
values for some of the parameters (ferritin, CRP, IFN-γ, IL-6). Uni-
variate and stepwise multivariate logistic regression were performed 
to assess predictors for the occurrence of severe neurotoxicity. No 
adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. The absolute CD4+ 
and CD8+ EGFRt+ CAR–T cell counts and their percentages within the 
parental subset were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. DFS 
was determined as the time from CAR–T cell infusion until failure, 
defined as death or the detection of relapsed or persistent disease by 
morphologic, flow cytometry, karyotyping, FISH, and/or QPCR stud-
ies. We compared the group who received Cy/Flu lymphodepletion and 
the group who received Cy-based lymphodepletion without Flu using 
the log-rank test, where P = 0.001. Significant was defined as P < 0.05.
