AbstrAct
Objective Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is associated 
with worsening of gastric atrophy, particularly in 
Helicobacter pylori (HP)-infected subjects. We determined 
the association between PPIs use and gastric cancer 
(GC) among HP-infected subjects who had received HP 
therapy.
Designs This study was based on a territory-wide 
health database of Hong Kong. We identified adults who 
had received an outpatient prescription of clarithromycin-
based triple therapy between year 2003 and 2012. 
Patients who failed this regimen, and those diagnosed to 
have GC within 12 months after HP therapy, or gastric 
ulcer after therapy were excluded. Prescriptions of PPIs or 
histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) started within 
6 months before GC were excluded to avoid protopathic 
bias. We evaluated GC risk with PPIs by Cox proportional 
hazards model with propensity score adjustment. H2RA 
was used as a negative control exposure.
result Among the 63 397 eligible subjects, 153 
(0.24%) developed GC during a median follow-up of 7.6 
years. PPIs use was associated with an increased GC risk 
(HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.20), while H2RA was not 
(HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.07). The risk increased with 
duration of PPIs use (HR 5.04, 95% CI 1.23 to 20.61; 
6.65, 95% CI 1.62 to 27.26 and 8.34, 95% CI 2.02 to 
34.41 for ≥1 year, ≥2 years and ≥3 years, respectively). 
The adjusted absolute risk difference for PPIs versus non-
PPIs use was 4.29 excess GC (95% CI 1.25 to 9.54) per 
10 000 person-years.
conclusion Long-term use of PPIs was still associated 
with an increased GC risk in subjects even after HP 
eradication therapy.
IntrODuctIOn
Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality in the world.1 Although 
Helicobacter pylori eradication has been shown to 
reduce the risk of gastric cancer development by 
33%–47%,2 3 a considerable proportion of these 
individuals continues to progress to gastric cancer 
even after eradication of H. pylori. Apart from 
baseline gastric histology at the time of eradica-
tion,4 data are sparse on other modifiable risks of 
gastric cancer development, particularly on the role 
of concurrent medications.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been among 
the most commonly prescribed medications in 
the world since the first PPI became available in 
the 1980s.5 Although PPIs are generally consid-
ered safe, recent data have demonstrated various 
adverse effects associated with long-term use of 
PPIs including bone fracture,6 Clostridium diffi-
cile infection,7 pneumonia,8 myocardial infarction 
and even stroke.9 Apart from the systemic adverse 
effects, there are also concerns on the long-term 
safety profile of PPIs in the stomach. The use of 
PPIs is associated with profound acid suppression, 
which could worsen atrophic gastritis.10 The risk is 
considerably high among individuals infected with 
H. pylori who are susceptible to the development 
of corpus atrophy.11 Moreover, PPIs stimulate the 
production of gastrin, which is a potent growth 
factor, and hypergastrinemia has been shown 
to induce hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like 
cells.11 A recent meta-analysis showed that the 
stomach

significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Although Helicobacter pylori eradication has 
been shown to reduce the risk of gastric cancer 
development, a considerable proportion of 
these individuals continues to progress to 
gastric cancer even after successful eradication 
of H. pylori.
 
► Previous studies have shown that the risk of 
gastric cancer was increased by 43% among 
PPIs users but the major confounding factor,  
H. pylori, was not adjusted in these analyses 
and the causal relationship may be biased.
What are the new findings?
 
► Long-term PPIs use was associated with a 
2.4-fold increase in gastric cancer risk in  
H. pylori-infected subjects who had received 
eradication therapy.
 
► The risk of gastric cancer increases with the 
dose and duration of PPIs use.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
 
► Physicians should exercise caution when 
prescribing long-term PPIs to H. pylori-infected 
individuals even after successful eradication of 
H. pylori.

risk of gastric cancer is increased by 43% among PPI users.12 
However, these studies included both H. pylori-infected and H. 
pylori-negative subjects. Although previous short-term studies 
suggested the resolution of corpus atrophy with H. pylori eradi-
cation therapy in patients with GORD,13 14 it remains uncertain 
whether the potential risk of PPIs on gastric cancer development 
could be eliminated by clearance of H. pylori.
This population-based study aimed to determine the risk 
of gastric cancer development among individuals who had 
received treatment for H. pylori with focus on the role of long-
term PPIs.

Data source
Data were retrieved from Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting 
System (CDARS) of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority. The 
Hospital Authority is the sole public healthcare provider for 
primary, secondary and tertiary health services through seven 
hospital clusters and covers 87%–94% of all secondary and 
tertiary care in Hong Kong with a population of around 
7.3 million.15 Under this system, there are altogether 42 public 
hospitals, 47 specialist out-patient clinics and 73 general 
out-patient clinics. All essential clinical information including 
patients’ demographics, hospitalisation, visits to outpatient 
clinics and emergency departments, diagnoses, laboratory 
results, procedures, prescriptions, dispensing of medications 
and death are recorded in CDARS, which is an electronic 
database managed by the hospital authority. This database 
was established in 1995 for both audit and research purposes. 
To protect patient’s confidentiality, each patient is assigned a 
unique, anonymous patient identifier, which is linked to all the 
clinical data contained in CDARS. A number of high-quality, 
population-based studies16–18 and multinational pharmacovig-
ilance studies19 20 have been conducted based on the data 
retrieved from CDARS. The International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), was used for disease coding 
and previous studies have verified the accuracy of the coding 
in CDARS with high positive and negative predictive values of 
more than 90%.17 21 The study protocol was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong 
and the West Cluster of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority 
(reference no: UW 16-545).
study subjects
We identified all adult patients who were aged 18 years or 
above and had been prescribed a minimum of 7-day course 
of clarithromycin-based triple therapy for H. pylori infec-
tion in outpatient clinics between 1 January 2003 and 31 
December 2012. H. pylori infection was diagnosed by either 
upper endoscopy with biopsy-based tests or urea breath test 
in clinical practice, as serology and stool antigen tests were 
not available in local public hospitals. The prescription of 
clarithromycin-based triple therapy was identified by the 
co-prescription of one of the PPIs with clarithromycin and 
either amoxicillin or metronidazole, with doses as described 
previously.22 The start date of the prescriptions should be the 
same, with an overlapping duration of 7–14 days. Clarithro-
mycin-based triple therapy was the first-line therapy for H. 
pylori in Hong Kong during the study period due to the low 
clarithromycin resistance rate (8%)23 and overall high eradi-
cation rate (>90%).24 To remove the confounding effects of 
symptoms from gastric cancer leading to the use of PPIs or 
histamine 2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) (ie, protopathic bias), 
prescriptions of these agents started within 6 months prior to 
the gastric cancer diagnosis were excluded.25 26
Since gastric cancer can masquerade as non-healing ulcer, 
all patients with gastric ulcer diagnosed at the time of or any 
time after receiving triple therapy were excluded. As there 
may be a delay in the diagnosis of gastric cancer, patients who 
developed gastric cancer within the first year of H. pylori 
eradication therapy were also excluded. Patients with history 
of gastric cancer, previous gastrectomy or those who failed 
triple therapy were also excluded to ensure homogeneity of 
our study cohort. We defined failure of H. pylori eradica-
tion therapy as the requirement of subsequent prescriptions 
of (1) repeated course of clarithromycin-based triple therapy, 
(2) a second-line therapy (bismuth-based quadruple therapy 
or PPI–levofloxacin–amoxicillin) or (3) a third-line therapy 
(rifabutin-based therapy). Figure 1 illustrates the inclusion and 
exclusion process of patients in this study. The time frame of 
the study is shown in the efigure1 in the online supplementary 
file 1.

carcinoma. The observation period commenced from the date

of first triple therapy prescription (ie, index date) and was 
censored at the date of diagnosis of gastric cancer, death or 
end of the study (31 December 2015). The date of diagnosis 
of gastric cancer was defined as the first date of hospitalisation 
for gastric cancer workup or treatment. Follow-up duration of 
individual patient was defined as the duration of observation 
between the index date and the censored date. All cases of 
gastric adenocarcinoma were identified in accordance with the 
ICD-9 (see etable 1 in the online supplementary file 1). We 
excluded patients with diagnosis of gastric lymphoma in this 
study. In order to ensure the validity of the case definition, a 
list of diagnostic codes was reviewed and finalised by a group 
of gastroenterologists.
study variables
The primary exposure of interest was the subsequent prescrip-
tion of PPIs after receiving the H. pylori eradication therapy. 
Potential confounders for gastric cancer development were 
also evaluated including the age of receiving triple therapy, 
sex, smoking status, alcohol consumption, history of gastric 
ulcer, history of duodenal ulcer, other comorbidities (including 
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity, isch-
aemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, 
stroke, chronic renal failure and cirrhosis) and uses of various 
medications including statin, metformin, aspirin, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, 
clopidogrel and H2RA.
PPIs are much more potent than H2RA in terms of gastric 
acid suppression,27 and previous studies did not reveal any asso-
ciation between gastric cancer development and H2RA.25 28 29 
Hence, H2RA was selected as a negative control exposure in our 
study. If there is a positive association between H2RA and gastric 
cancer, this will suggest some unmeasured factors (including 
protopathic bias) that confound the causal relationship between 
PPIs and gastric cancer development.
To further control for possible confounding effects, another 
cohort of PPIs users (defined similarly as at least weekly use) 
who had not received H. pylori eradication therapy and fulfilled 
the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as in our H. pylori 
eradication cohort was recruited for comparison. These PPIs 
users who had not received H. pylori eradication therapy were 
then matched with the PPIs users who had received H. pylori 
eradication therapy (n=3271) by age (±5 years), sex, duration 
of follow-up (±2 years) and frequency of PPIs use (±0.3) in a 
1:4 ratio. The incidence rates of gastric cancer in the two PPIs 
cohorts were compared.
We used similar approaches as adopted by Poulsen et al28 to 
ascertain smoking status and alcohol consumption as these data 
were not available in the CDRAS. Smoking was identified by 
the ICD-9 code of V15.82 while chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) (ICD-9 codes: 491, 492, 496) was also used as 
proxy of heavy smoking. Heavy alcohol consumption was iden-
tified by alcohol-related diseases, including hepatic and gastro-
intestinal diseases, neurological and psychiatric diseases (ICD-9: 
291, 303, 305.0, 571, 980). The diagnostic codes of other vari-
ables are listed in the etable 1 in the online supplementary file 1.
In the primary analysis, the exposure categories of various 
medications were categorised similarly into non-regular use 
(<weekly 
use; reference group) and regular use (at least weekly 
use) as described by Thrift et al.30 The treatment duration of 
each prescription of a particular medication was defined as the 
difference between the prescription start date and end date 
within the observation period. The total treatment duration of 
that particular medication was then calculated by summing up 
the treatment duration of each prescription.
To study the dose–response relationship of PPIs on gastric 
cancer, the frequency of PPIs use was classified into three 
groups: (1) <weekly use, (2) weekly to <daily use and (3) 
daily use. The frequency of PPIs use was calculated by dividing 
the total treatment duration by the duration of follow-up. The 
effect of PPIs was also studied with regard to the duration of 
therapy which was categorised into ≥1 year, ≥2 years and ≥3 
years as defined in a recent meta-analysis.12
Data validation
As individual’s identification is anonymised in the electronic 
database (CDARS), we could only retrieve detailed informa-
tion of the gastric cancer cases that were managed in our centre 
(Queen Mary Hospital), which is a tertiary referral centre and a 
university teaching hospital. Of the 153 gastric cancer cases, 12 
cases were managed in our centre and were reviewed in detail 
for gastric histology.
statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using R V
.3.2.3 (R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing) statistical software. Continuous 
variables were expressed as median and IQR. Mann-Whitney 
U-test was used to compare continuous variables of two groups. 
χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test was applied for categorical vari-
ables. The crude HR of gastric cancer development with PPIs 
use was calculated by univariate analysis using Cox proportional 
hazards model. For multivariable analysis, PPIs use and other 
covariates (age of receiving H. pylori eradication therapy, sex, 
smoking, alcohol use, comorbidities and concomitant medica-
tions) were included in the Cox model. To better control for 
the confounders, propensity score adjustment was performed. 
Propensity scores were derived from logistic regression to repre-
sent the conditional probability of PPIs use given the aforemen-
tioned covariates. To further reduce the bias from unmeasured 
confounding, individuals with extreme scores in the upper and 
lower tails of the propensity score distribution were excluded.31 
In order to establish the cut-points for trimming, we constructed 
20 categories of 5% each for the distribution of scores. To assess 
the balance of the continuous variable (age of receiving H. pylori 
eradication therapy) between PPIs users and non-users, the t-sta-
tistics adjusted for propensity score strata (by linear regression) 
and the p value were determined.
In the primary analysis, the first and 20th propensity score 
strata were trimmed, and the estimated propensity score was 
then used as an adjustment variable in the Cox proportional 
hazards model to derive the HR (propensity score adjustment 
with trimming). A sensitivity analysis was also performed 
without trimming the extreme propensity score strata (propen-
sity score adjustment without trimming). In addition, the HR 
by univariate and multivariable analyses from Cox proportional 
hazards model were presented. For subgroup analysis, the risk 
of gastric cancer with PPIs use was stratified according to the 
tumour sites (cardia and non-cardia regions). Moreover, we 
estimated the propensity score adjusted absolute difference in 
gastric cancer risk for PPIs and non-PPIs use by the adjusted HR 
minus 1, followed by the multiplication of the crude incidence 
rate among non-PPIs users.32 As H2RA was selected as a nega-
tive control exposure, propensity scores were also derived from 
logistic regression to represent the conditional probability of 
H2RA use given the other variables. The HR of gastric cancer 
with H2RA use was determined by propensity score adjustment

Patient characteristics
A total of 74 
612 subjects received clarithromycin-based triple 
therapy during the 10-year period. After excluding patients who 
did not fulfil our inclusion criteria (figure 1), 63 
397 subjects 
were included in the final analysis. The median age of this cohort 
at the time of H. pylori eradication therapy was 54.7 years (IQR 
46.0–65.4 years) and 46.5% were men. The median follow-up 
was 7.6 years (IQR 5.1–10.3 yeas) and the total follow-up dura-
tion was 483 
260 person-years. The baseline characteristics 
of the whole cohort and the subgroups according to PPIs and

risk of gastric cancer development
One hundred and fifty-three (0.24%) subjects developed 
gastric cancer after H. pylori eradication therapy. Among them, 
31 (20.3%) cancer were in the cardia and 95 (62.1%) in the 
non-cardia regions. The sites were not specified in the remaining 
27 (17.6%) cases (ICD-9: 151.9). Similar ratio were observed 
for all the stomach cancer cases (n=12 
898) diagnosed in the 
public hospitals in Hong Kong during the study period (13.4% 
in cardia, 67.5% in non-cardia and 19.1% cases with sites 
unspecified).
The histology reports of 12 (7.8% out of 153) gastric cancer 
cases from our centre were retrieved, and all cancers were verified 
to be adenocarcinoma. All patients were negative for H. pylori 
on gastric biopsies at the time of diagnosis and had underlying 
chronic gastritis, while intestinal metaplasia was reported in five 
cases. For the degree of differentiation, five cases were poorly 
differentiated, three were moderately to poorly differentiated, 
one was moderately differentiated, while the degree of differen-
tiation was unspecified for the remaining three. According to the 
Lauren classification, three cases were diffuse type, three were 
intestinal type and the histological subtypes were unspecified for 
the remaining six.
The median age at cancer diagnosis was 71.4 years (IQR 61.1–
81.5 years). Patients who developed gastric cancer received H.

56.4–76.2 years), and the median time from H. pylori eradica-
tion therapy to cancer development was 4.9 years (IQR 2.7–7.2 
years). The overall incidence rate of gastric cancer in this cohort 
was 3.2 per 10 
000 person-years. The incidence rate of gastric 
cancer of PPIs users for each follow-up year is shown in etable 
2 in the online supplementary file 1, which ranged from 0 to 
18.5 per 10 
000 person-years. Patients who developed gastric 
cancer within the first year of H. pylori eradication therapy were 
excluded in this study as described above.
Association of PPIs use and risk of gastric cancer
Table 3 shows the associations between PPIs use and gastric 
cancer development after H. pylori therapy. PPIs users (at least 
weekly use) were found to have a higher risk of gastric cancer 
(HR 2.44, 95% 
CI 1.42 to 4.20) after propensity score adjust-
ment with trimming. Sensitivity analysis confirms the association 
of PPIs use with gastric cancer development by either multivari-
able analysis (HR 2.19, 95% 
CI 1.31 to 3.66) or propensity score 
adjustment without trimming (HR 2.14, 95% 
CI 1.27 to 3.58).
The propensity score adjusted absolute risk difference between 
PPIs use and non-PPIs use was 4.29 excess gastric cancer (95% 
CI 
1.25 to 9.54) per 10 
000 person-years.
After stratification by the site of tumour, PPIs use was only 
found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of 
non-cardia gastric cancer (HR 2.59, 95% 
CI 1.42 to 4.72) but 
not cardia cancer (HR 1.97, 95% 
CI 0.57 to 6.82). Sensitivity 
analysis yielded similar results.
PPIs users were older than non-PPIs users by around 10 years, 
and the HR of gastric cancer with increasing age was 1.06 on 
multivariable analysis. Therefore, the t-statistics was used to 
assess the balance of age between the two groups. After adjusting 
for propensity score strata, the age was balanced between the 
two groups (t-statistics −1.42, p=0.156).
Frequency and duration of PPIs use on risk of gastric cancer
A total of 3271 (5.2%) patients in this cohort had used PPIs 
and the median duration of PPIs use was 2.7 years (IQR 1.5–5.1 
years). Among them, 19 (0.6%) developed gastric cancer (8.1 
per 10 
000 person-years). We further determined the frequency 
and duration of PPIs use on gastric cancer development. Patients 
were first stratified according to the frequency of PPIs use 
(table 4) into three groups as described in the Methods section. 
When compared with the reference group (<weekly 
use), there 
was a progressive increase in the risk of gastric cancer with more 
frequent use of PPIs (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.37 to 4.31 for ‘weekly

4 in the online supplementary file 1).
Furthermore, the effect of long-term PPIs on gastric cancer 
development was studied with regard to the duration of PPIs 
therapy (≥1 
year, ≥2 years and ≥3 years). As shown in table 4, 
the risk increased with longer duration of PPIs use (HR 5.04,

Association of H2rA use and risk of gastric cancer
To test for potential confounding, H2RA was used as a negative 
control exposure. The HR of gastric cancer with H2RA use on 
univariate analysis was 0.95 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.33), while the 
HR from propensity score adjustment with trimming was 0.72 
(95% CI 0.48 to 1.07).
comparison of the incidence rates of gastric cancer with a 
matched cohort of PPIs users who had not received H. pylori 
eradication therapy
To further check for potential confounding, another cohort of 
PPIs users (at least weekly use) who had not received H. pylori 
eradication therapy were included for comparison. Altogether, 
142 
460 PPIs users without prior H. pylori eradication therapy 
were identified with a total of 705 
094 person-years of follow-up. 
Among them, there were 59 gastric cancer cases making a 
crude incidence rate of 0.8 cases per 10 
000 person-years. After 
matching, the incidence rate was 8.1 and 1.0 cases per 10 
000 
person-years in the two cohorts of PPIs users with and without 
H. pylori eradication therapy, respectively (incidence rate ratio 
0.12; 95% 
CI 0.05 to 0.26) (table 5).
DIscussIOn
In this population-based study that addressed the risk of gastric 
cancer development in H. pylori-infected individuals after 
receiving eradication treatment, we found that long-term use of 
PPIs increased the risk of gastric cancer development. Our results 
showed that even after apparent successful H. pylori eradication 
therapy, those who used long-term PPIs had a 2.4-fold increase 
in the risk of gastric cancer development than non-users. This 
increase in risk was not observed among H2RA users. Further 
analysis demonstrated a dose-dependent and time-dependent 
increase in the HRs of gastric cancer with PPIs use, with the 
highest risk observed in daily users of PPIs (HR 4.55). Patients 
who took PPIs daily for ≥3 years were at the highest risk (HR 
8.34). Notably, the increase in HR was limited to non-cardia 
cancer, although this result should be interpreted with caution 
as this subgroup analysis has a relatively small number of cardia 
cancers.
Gastric atrophy is considered to be a precursor of gastric 
cancer, which is usually associated with chronic H. pylori infec-
tion. While PPIs are potent acid suppressors, there have been 
concerns on the possible worsening of gastric atrophy by long-
term PPIs and the associated increase in gastric cancer risk.10 12 
Most published data supported that long-term PPIs could worsen 
corpus gastritis and atrophy, particularly in H. pylori-positive 
subjects.10 33 Although the long-term use of PPIs for more than 
12 months was shown to be associated with an increased risk 
of gastric cancer,12 these results are largely confounded by the 
unknown prevalence of H. pylori in the study population.25 28 29 
On the other hand, treatment of H. pylori in patients with reflux 
oesophagitis requiring long-term PPIs was found to eliminate 
gastric mucosal inflammation and possibly induce regression 
of corpus glandular atrophy.13 Hence, current guideline recom-
mends eradication of H. pylori prior to the initiation of long-term 
PPIs.34 While GORD is related to overproduction of gastric acid 
and hence a lower prevalence of corpus atrophy, these patients 
may not be the ideal population to study relationship between 
PPIs use and worsening of corpus atrophy and gastric cancer. 
There is so far no long-term data to support that H. pylori erad-
ication is sufficient in preventing cancer development in these 
individuals who use long-term PPIs.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that 
long-term PPIs use, even after H. pylori eradication therapy, 
is still associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. This 
is likely related to the profound acid suppression of PPIs that 
worsens atrophic gastritis, particularly in those patients with 
established gastric atrophy as a result of chronic H. pylori-in-
duced inflammation. The lack of association between H2RA use 
and gastric cancer development further supports the specific role 
of PPIs on gastric cancer development. One of the strengths of 
our study is the use of data from large population-based data-
base with complete information on subsequent diagnoses and 
drug prescriptions, thus minimising the selection, informa-
tion and recall biases. As all medications are dispensed by the

hospital pharmacy at a very low cost to patients (ie, £1 per item 
for 16 weeks), the prescription records are generally identical to 
dispensing records. The large sample size and the relatively long 
duration of follow-up (median 7.6 years) allow for more precise 
effect estimation of gastric cancer risk attributed to various 
factors and enable subgroup analysis. The association was also 
consistent in both the frequency and duration of PPIs treat-
ment, demonstrating a dose-response and time-response trend 
to suggest a cause–effect relationship.
Another strength of this study was the use of a strict exclu-
sion criteria as well as propensity score adjustment to control 
for potential confounders in determining the causal relationship 
between PPIs use and gastric cancer development. The results 
remained significant by various sensitivity analyses. In addition, 
we recruited patients with successful H. pylori eradication only. 
In fact, failure to adjust for H. pylori infection is one of the 
major concerns in studying the effect of PPIs on gastric cancer 
risk in previous studies.25 28 29 The indication bias and proto-
pathic bias was another major concern that leads to the undeter-
mined conclusion of the causal relationship between PPIs use and 
gastric cancer development in previous studies.25 28 29 First, as 
gastric cancer can present with dyspepsia leading to an increase 
use of PPIs, all prescriptions of PPIs in the 6 
months preceding 
the diagnosis of gastric cancer were excluded to avoid proto-
pathic bias in this study. We used 6 
months as the priori cut-off 
because previous study that specifically addressed the issue of 
protopathic bias showed that this was the most appropriate 
lag-time to be applied for the assessment of PPIs exposure on 
gastric cancer risk in pharmaco-epidemiological studies.26 More-
over, PPIs are not approved as first-line therapy for dyspepsia in 
the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, and H2RAs are usually the 
recommended treatment for this indication. One would antici-
pate a similar increase in gastric cancer risk among those taking 
H2RAs (negative control exposure) if there was significant indi-
cation bias in this cohort. The minimisation of protopathic bias 
and indication bias was further supported by the findings that 
the matched cohort of PPIs users without H. pylori eradication 
therapy had the lowest incidence rate when compared with the 
two post-H. pylori eradicated cohorts (table 5). By comparing 
the incidence rate of gastric cancer of a matched cohort of PPIs 
users who had not received H. pylori eradication therapy, we 
showed that H. pylori infection, even prior infection, was a more 
important factor than PPIs use in determining gastric cancer risk. 
PPIs increase the risk of gastric cancer development likely in the 
context of underlying H. pylori-associated chronic gastritis and 
atrophy. In addition, we excluded patients who had active gastric 
ulcer diagnosed at the time of H. pylori eradication therapy or 
during surveillance intervals as gastric cancer may masquerade as 
non-healing gastric ulcer.
Our study has several limitations. First, the information of 
some risk factors (eg, diet, family history and socioeconomic 
status) could not be obtained from the electronic database. 
Moreover, the identification of certain parameters (smoking, 
alcohol use and obesity) via coding may underestimate their 
true prevalence, as only patients who had heavy consumption 
of smoking and alcohol or who were morbidly obese would be 
coded. Second, although patients who failed triple therapy were 
identified by the repeated prescription of clarithromycin-based 
triple therapy or prescription of second-line and third-line ther-
apies, it remains possible that a small proportion of patients who 
failed H. pylori eradication therapy might be missed. In this 
study, about 13% of patients received a second course of eradica-
tion therapy, which is compatible with the observed success rate 
of clarithromycin-based triple therapy in our population with 
relatively low prevalence of clarithromycin resistance during 
the study period.23 In addition, we have validated the negative 
H. pylori status of all 12 gastric cancer cases from our hospital. 
Third, although we included more than 63 
000 H. pylori-in-
fected subjects, the small number of gastric cancer cases did not 
allow for any meaningful evaluation of the dosage effect and role 
of different PPIs. However, it was recently shown that there was 
no difference in the gastric cancer risk between longer and short-
er-acting PPIs.35 Fourth, PPIs users may have a higher chance to 
have endoscopy than non-PPIs users resulting in discovery of 
more gastric cancers due to surveillance bias. However, as shown 
in the etable 2 in the online supplementary file 1, the incidence 
rate of gastric cancer remained relatively stable throughout the 
follow-up period rather than an early peak in the first few years 
followed by a rapid drop in the ensuing years. Fifth, PPIs users 
were older than non-users in our cohort. Age was shown to be a 
significant risk factor for gastric cancer development (HR 1.06) 
on multivariable analysis. The comparability of the two groups 
may therefore be a concern, but this issue has been addressed 
by the use of propensity score adjustment with trimming and 
various sensitivity analyses. The non-significance of t-statistics 
between the PPIs users and non-users after adjusting for the 
propensity score strata further supports the robustness of this 
adjustment. Moreover, H2RA users were also significantly older 
than non-users (table 2), but a similar increase in gastric cancer 
risk was not observed among H2RA users. Sixth, our patients are 
mainly Chinese, and hence our results may not be generisable 
to other ethnic groups, as Asians are at a higher gastric cancer 
risk than the western population.1 Lastly, the detailed histolog-
ical findings of gastric biopsies at baseline and at the time of 
gastric cancer development were not available in the CDARS, 
precluding more in-depth analysis between the association of 
PPIs and baseline histology on gastric cancer development.
cOnclusIOn
Long-term use of PPIs in subjects with prior H. pylori eradica-
tion was still associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer 
development, particularly for non-cardia cancer. There was also 
a clear dose–response and time–response trend of PPIs uses and 
gastric cancer risk. Physicians should therefore exercise caution 
when prescribing long-term PPIs to these patients even after 
successful eradication of H. pylori.
