Abstract
Background—While some evidence shows that neighborhood deprivation is associated with 
greater subclinical atherosclerosis, prior studies have not identified what aspects of deprived 
neighborhoods were driving the association.
Methods—We investigated whether social and physical neighborhood characteristics are related 
to progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in 5,950 adult participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study 
of Atherosclerosis (MESA) over a 12 year follow-up period. We assessed subclinical disease using 
coronary artery calcium (CAC). Neighborhood features examined included density of recreational 
facilities, density of healthy food stores, and survey based measures of availability of healthy 
foods, walking environment, and social environment. We used econometric fixed effects models to 
investigate how change in a given neighborhood exposure is related to simultaneous change in 
subclinical atherosclerosis.

 Results—Increases in density of neighborhood healthy food stores were associated with 
decreases in CAC [mean changes in CAC Agatston units per SD increase in neighborhood 
exposures: −19.99 (−35.21, −4.78] after adjusting for time-varying demographic confounders and 
computed tomography (CT) scanner type. This association remained similar in magnitude after 
additionally adjusting for time-varying behavioral risk factors and depression. The addition of 
time-varying biomedical factors attenuated associations with CAC slightly [mean changes in CAC 
per SD increase in neighborhood exposures: −17.60 (−32.71, −2.49)]. Changes across time in 
other neighborhood measures were not significantly associated with within-person change in 
CAC.
Conclusions—Results from this longitudinal study provide suggestive evidence that greater 
access to neighborhood healthy food resources may slow the development of coronary 
atherosclerosis in middle-aged and older adults.

Neighborhood deprivation, including high neighborhood poverty level, low education level, 
high unemployment, poor housing conditions, and other indicators, has been linked to 
greater prevalence and incidence of coronary heart disease1, 2. There is some evidence that 
specific neighborhood features such as fewer neighborhood physical activity resources3, 4 
and less safety5, 6 and social connectedness7 are associated with greater coronary heart 
disease prevalence, incidence and mortality but questions remain regarding whether these 
associations reflect causal processes.
A limitation of focusing on clinical cardiovascular outcomes (especially in the cross-
sectional context) is that it is not possible to determine the direction of causality (i.e. 
whether neighborhood characteristics have caused poorer cardiovascular health or poorer 
cardiovascular health has caused participants to live in certain kinds of neighborhoods). In 
addition, studies that focus on clinical outcomes are unable to determine whether 
neighborhood exposures are related to the triggering of cardiovascular events in persons with 
underlying atherosclerotic disease or to the development of atherosclerosis itself.
A few studies have reported that neighborhood deprivation is associated with greater 
subclinical atherosclerosis8–12; however, prior studies were not able to identify what aspects 
of deprived neighborhoods were driving the association. Investigation of specific 
neighborhood exposures beyond neighborhood deprivation is of key public health relevance 
since this approach provides insight into specific pathways for intervention. Further, the 
investigation of whether changes in neighborhood characteristics are related to changes in 
subclinical disease strengthens causal inferences.
We investigated whether social and physical neighborhood characteristics are related to 
progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in healthy older male and female participants of 
the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) over a 12 year follow-up period. Because 
a range of neighborhood factors could be important we examined several characteristics 
previously hypothesized to be linked to the development of coronary heart disease13. The

 study design allowed us to investigate how change in a given neighborhood exposure related 
to simultaneous change in subclinical atherosclerosis.
Methods
Study sample
The study sample consisted of 6814 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis (MESA), a longitudinal study of subclinical cardiovascular disease. 
Participants who were aged 45–84 years and free of clinical cardiovascular disease were 
enrolled into the study from six field sites (Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Forsyth 
County, North Carolina; Los Angeles, California; New York, New York; and St. Paul, 
Minnesota) from 2000–200214. The study was approved by the institutional review boards at 
each site and all participants gave written informed consent. Our analysis used data from five 
MESA exams, spanning 2000 to 2011, and included only data from those who participated 
in the neighborhood ancillary study (n=6191). We further restricted our sample to only 
include those that had multiple CAC measurements, yielding an analytic sample of 5950 
participants.
Coronary artery calcium outcome
We used coronary artery calcium (CAC) as a measure of subclinical disease; it has been 
shown to independently predict coronary events in diverse ethnic groups. CAC was assessed 
by chest computed tomography (CT) and quantified with the continuous Agatston score, 
measured in Agatston units15. Cardiac computed tomography was performed on all 
participants at baseline, a second CAC measurement was performed on half of the cohort at 
exam 2, and the other half participants were scanned at exam 3. Additional CAC 
measurements were taken on a subset of the MESA cohort at exam 4 and exam 5. Four 
percent of the sample had only one CAC measurement (and were excluded), 38% had two, 
45% had three, and 13% had four CAC measurements. The median (IQR) years since 
baseline for each exam’s CAC measurement are as follows: for exam 2, the median time 
since baseline was 1.6 (1.4–1.8) years; for exam 3, 3.1 (3.0–3.4) years, for exam 4, 4.8 (4.6–
5.0) years, and exam 5, 9.4 (9.1–9.7) years since baseline.
Neighborhood exposure measurements
The neighborhood environment was characterized using both commercially available food 
store and recreational facility data as well as using surveys on healthy food, walking, safety, 
and social cohesion.
Geographic Information Systems-based measures: recreational and healthy food 
resources
The availability of healthy food stores and recreational facilities within 1 mile of 
participants’ homes was characterized using ArcGIS 9.316. Normal kernel estimation17 was 
used to calculate the densities, such that facilities closer to participants’ homes were given 
more weight than those farther away. Densities are expressed in units per mile2 (henceforth, 
“densities” indicates units/mile2). Relevant classifications and locations of stores and 
facilities were identified from Dun and Bradstreet data as compiled by Walls and Associates 
Wing et al.

 in the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) database18. Recreational facilities 
included 114 standard industrial classification (SIC) codes that classified an establishment as 
having potential for physical activity or recreation such as indoor conditioning, dance, 
bowling, golf, team and racquet sports, and water activities; this classification was derived 
from previous studies19, 20. Healthy food stores included fruit and vegetable markets and 
supermarkets (defined as food stores with at least $2 million in annual sales or at least 25 
employees). Additional data were included from the Nielsen TDLinx Service Supermarket 
Retail Category Database to further capture area supermarkets as described by Auchincloss 
and coauthors21. Densities were created for each calendar year between 2000 and 2010.
Survey-based measures
Survey-based neighborhood scales included the availability of healthy food (2 items), 
walking environment (4 items), safety (2 items) and social cohesion (4 items) where the 
participant was asked to rate their neighborhood within a mile of their home (the items are 
listed in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). These aspects of the neighborhood 
environment were selected based on conceptual links to cardiovascular disease22 and 
developed based on prior work23, 24. Survey data collected from MESA participants was 
combined with data from participants in an external survey (the Community Survey) 
administered to other residents of neighborhoods in which MESA participants lived. Scales 
were based on a 1-mile buffer around the participant’s residence and were created by taking 
the crude mean of the responses for all respondents living within a 1-mile buffer, excluding 
themselves. Only respondents who answered all questions within the scale were included. 
Each score has a total possible range from 1 to 5, with a higher score representing a more 
favorable environment.
Covariates
Time-invariant demographic covariates included highest education level completed, race/
ethnicity and gender, all assessed via questionnaire at the baseline exam. All other covariates 
were time-varying, and for exams where a given measure was not assessed, the value from 
the closest exam was used. Demographic covariates included age, marital status, family 
income level and current employment status. Moderate and vigorous physical activity level 
were based on summed minutes of reported relevant physical activities multiplied by the 
activity’s metabolic equivalent, and cigarette smoking status was classified as current, 
former, or never. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 20-item Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale25. Biomedical factors, measured by 
physical exam and laboratory tests, included diabetes mellitus, defined as fasting glucose 
≥126 mg/dl or the use of hypoglycemic medications; hypertension, defined as a systolic 
blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg or taking antihypertensive 
medication; body-mass index (BMI), calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2); and total to 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (both measured from blood samples obtained after 
a 12-hour fast). Self-reported medications for elevated lipids were also included. CT scanner 
model was also included as a time-varying covariate because scanner type varied across site 
and time.

 Statistical Methods
We examined the distribution of demographic characteristics and risk factors across levels of 
baseline CAC [participants with baseline CAC equal to zero (i.e. no discernible calcium on 
the coronary artery); (2) those with baseline CAC between zero and 86.5 Agatston units (the 
median of those with CAC above zero); (3) and those with CAC equal to or over 86.5 
Agatston units]. ANOVA was used to compare continuous variables, and chi-square tests 
were used for categorical variables. We also examined associations of categories of 
neighborhood characteristics (based on quartiles) with (1) percent with baseline CAC > zero; 
(2) mean baseline CAC and (3) mean annual change in CAC after adjustment for age, gender 
and race/ethnicity (chi-square tests, linear tests for trend, and time-interaction terms were 
used to test these comparisons). Based on prior MESA analyses26 and analytical 
recommendations, and given the known robustness of results to violations of the normality 
assumption27, CAC was treated as a continuous variable on the native scale to facilitate 
model fitting and interpretation of associations.
The association of CAC with each of the six neighborhood measures (density of recreational 
facilities, density of healthy food stores, and survey based measures of availability of healthy 
foods, walking environment, social cohesion and safety) was initially examined separately. 
The survey-based social environment measures (i.e. safety and social cohesion) were highly 
correlated and similarly related to CAC and were therefore combined into a summary social 
environment index (Cronbach’s alpha =0.77), by standardizing and then summing their 
standardized scores. To facilitate comparison across estimates, all neighborhood 
characteristics were standardized and included in regression models in standard deviation 
(SD) units. Each neighborhood variable was tested in a separate model.
Econometric fixed-effects models28 were employed to estimate associations of within-
person changes in neighborhood characteristics with within-person changes in CAC. This 
approach allowed us to examine whether changes in exposures were related to simultaneous 
changes in the outcome. Because they condition on the study participant, these models have 
the important advantage of tightly adjusting for measured and unmeasured time invariant 
characteristics of individuals28 and thus, they were only adjusted for time-varying 
covariates. We used a sequence of four models that are based on the hypothesized causal 
pathways linking neighborhood exposures to the outcome (the models progressively adjust 
for variables more proximal to the outcome and hence more likely to be in the causal 
pathway). Model 1 adjusted for demographic covariates (age, marital status, income and 
working status) and CT scanner type; Model 2 additionally adjusted for health behaviors 
(moderate/vigorous physical activity, cigarette smoking status); Model 3 additionally 
adjusted for depressive symptoms (CES-D); and Model 4 additionally adjusted for 
biomedical factors (total cholesterol to HDL ratio, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and lipid 
lowering medication). Each of the five neighborhood characteristics was investigated 
separately. Because it has been suggested that neighborhood SES may confound associations 
of neighborhood physical and social environments with health outcomes, additional 
adjustment for neighborhood SES using a summary measure29 was investigated in 
sensitivity analyses. We also explored effect modification of the neighborhood 
characteristics by gender and race/ethnicity in an exploratory analysis.

 Main analyses included both movers and non-movers (hence changes over time in 
neighborhood exposures may result from moving to a different neighborhood or from 
changes over time in a neighborhood). In sensitivity analyses we adjusted for moving by 
including a time-varying indicator of whether the participant had moved between the prior 
visit and the current visit and an interaction term between the moving indicator and the 
neighborhood variable.
Results are presented as the mean difference in CAC for a 1 SD increase in neighborhood 
score and 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical tests were two-sided; P-values less 
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant and were not adjusted for multiple testing. 
All analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.3 (Cary, NC).
Results
Of the 5,950 participants in our sample, 86% of them contributed to at least three time 
points, with a mean of 2.7 time points per participant (SD=0.7) and a mean follow-up time 
between CAC measurements was 3.5 years (SD=3.1). Average (SD) CAC in the total sample 
at baseline was 135 (SD=380). Just over half of participants (51%) had a CAC of zero at 
baseline (Table 1). A non-zero CAC at baseline was associated with being older, male, of 
white race/ethnicity, having a lower income, less education and being a former smoker. 
Thirty-two percent of participants moved at some point during the follow-up period.
The percent of participants with CAC>0 at baseline was lower (45%) in the highest quartile 
of healthy food density than in other quartiles (49–50%) after adjusting for age, gender and 
race/ethnicity (Table 2). Residents of neighborhoods with higher levels of social cohesion 
and safety were slightly more likely to have CAC>0 at baseline than those of neighborhoods 
with lower social cohesion and safety (51% vs 44 % for highest vs lowest quartiles) after 
adjustment.
Mean baseline CAC was lower in neighborhoods with a higher density of healthy food stores 
and with higher reported availability of healthy foods after adjustment for age, gender and 
race/ethnicity although trends across quartiles were not statistically significant (Table 2). No 
clear pattern in mean CAC was apparent across quartiles of recreational facility density, the 
walking environment or the social environment. Mean annual CAC progressed fastest in 
neighborhoods with a lower density of recreational facilities, a lower density of healthy food 
stores (although no dose response was observed) and lower reported availability of healthy 
foods after adjustment for age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The patterns of mean annual 
change were inconsistent across quartiles of other survey-based neighborhood 
characteristics. Of the total variance in CAC, 17% was within persons. Of the total variance 
in neighborhood characteristics 10, 5, 31, 21, and 16% were within persons for recreational 
facility density, healthy food store density, availability of health food, walking environment 
and social environment, respectively.
Within-person increases in neighborhood healthy food stores density were associated with 
within person decreases in subclinical atherosclerosis (Table 3). In Model 1, which adjusted 
for time-varying demographic confounders and CT scanner type, increases in density of

 neighborhood healthy food stores were associated with decreases in CAC (mean changes in 
CAC per SD increase in neighborhood exposures: −19.99 (−35.21, −4.78)). This association 
remained similar in magnitude after additionally adjusting for time-varying behavioral risk 
factors and depression (see Models 2 and 3 in Table 3) The addition of time-varying 
biomedical factors (Model 4) attenuated associations with CAC slightly −17.60 (−32.71, 
−2.49). Within-person increases in recreational facilities density were associated with 
decreases in calcium but associations were not statistically significant. In exploratory 
analyses the association of healthy food density with calcium was stronger in women than in 
males (interaction p-value = 0.02 but no effect modification by race/ethnicity was observed).
When survey-based measures were used, neither changes in availability of healthy foods, 
changes in walking environments, nor changes in the social environment were significantly 
associated with changes in CAC over time. In sensitivity analyses associations of healthy 
food densities with changes in calcium were robust to additional adjustment for 
neighborhood SES. A sensitivity analysis that included adjustment for moving status did not 
find heterogeneity in estimates by moving status (all interaction p-values > 0.47).
Discussion
Our study found that increases in the density of healthy food stores around the home were 
related to simultaneous decreases in subclinical atherosclerosis as characterized by coronary 
calcium after adjusting for age, marital status, income, working status, and CT scanner type. 
These associations were slightly reduced but persisted after additional adjustment for 
changes in moderate/ vigorous physical activity, cigarette smoking status, CES-D, total/HDL 
ratio, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, any lipid lowering medication. The effect size associated 
with a 1 SD increase in the density was similar to the effect on CAC of a one-year increase 
in age (17–20 point increase in CAC). Although a number of studies have linked 
neighborhood characteristics to CHD incidence and mortality6, 7, 30, 31 no studies of which 
we are aware have investigated associations of changes in neighborhood factors with the 
progression of subclinical atherosclerosis. Our results suggest that effects of neighborhood 
food context on the development of subclinical disease may be one of the mechanisms 
through which these factors impact the incidence of coronary heart disease.
The use of fixed effects models allowed us to investigate whether a within-person change in 
the neighborhood attribute was related to a within-person change in CAC while tightly 
adjusting for time invariant person characteristics that could confound associations of 
neighborhood characteristics with CAC. This is a major advance over prior work, which can 
be subject to between-person confounding. While residual confounding by time-varying 
characteristics (including socioeconomic factors) cannot be completely ruled out in our 
study, we adjusted for several time varying confounders in the models. If moving status is 
related to changes in calcium and to changes in neighborhood exposures it could confound 
the associations of interest. However, adjusting for moving status and allowing associations 
to differ by moving status did not materially affect our conclusions. A limitation of fixed 
effects models is that they rely exclusively on within-person variability and can be inefficient 
when within person variability in exposures or outcomes is very low. As expected within 
person variability in neighborhood characteristics was substantially smaller than between

 person variability, possibly limiting our ability to detect statistically significant associations 
with some neighborhood exposures.
Neighborhood food environments may affect cardiovascular risk by shaping dietary intake. 
Studies have linked food environments with limited choices and /or high prevalence of fast 
food restaurants to poorer diet quality and greater fast food consumption32, 33. Greater 
neighborhood availability of healthier foods has also been linked to higher fruit and 
vegetable consumption34. Diets higher in fruits, vegetables, antioxidants, whole grains and 
fish have been shown to reduce progression of subclinical heart disease in prospective 
observational studies35 and randomized trials36, 37, and some evidence from randomized 
trials shows a reversal of carotid atherosclerosis through adherence to a heart healthy diet38. 
In our study, greater access to healthier foods may have promoted healthier diets and less 
coronary plaque formation in neighborhood residents. The limited dietary data available in 
MESA at the time of these analyses limited our ability to examine the mediating effects of 
diet.
Greater neighborhood availability of recreational resources has been associated with a 
greater physical activity level in residents39, 40 and longitudinal studies have shown that 
greater physical activity reduces progression of subclinical coronary disease41, 42. Other 
studies have shown that favorable neighborhood physical activity environments are 
associated with better cardiometabolic risk factors43 lower BMI and waist size44, lower risk 
of type 2 diabetes45 and decreased risk of coronary events30, 31. Although the associations of 
changes in recreational facilities with changes in CAC were in the hypothesized direction, 
they were not statistically significant. It could be that recreational facility densities are not 
important drivers of overall physical activity (which may be more relevant to CAC change 
than only leisure activity).
Survey based measures of the neighborhood food, physical activity and social environments 
were not significantly related to CAC progression. It has been argued that survey based 
measures of neighborhoods may capture information that is not reflected in objective 
locational data46. The social environment in particular is more readily measured using 
survey measures. In past work we have documented associations of baseline survey based 
measures of the physical environment (especially the food environment) with incidence of 
diabetes and obesity47–49. An important limitation of survey-based measures in this study, 
however, is that their time-varying nature was much more limited than it was for the density 
measures (which were updated every year). In contrast the survey based measures relied on 
substantial interpolation to create time-varying measures. This added measurement error and 
reduced within person variability may have seriously limited our ability to detect 
associations of change with change in the fixed effects models.
We hypothesized that a favorable social environment would improve stress and depressive 
symptoms, favorably impacting CAC. Though only one identified cross-sectional study has 
evaluated neighborhood social characteristics in relation to CAC, reporting that better social 
environment was related to lower CAC11, other studies have found that a better social 
neighborhood environment is associated with reduced myocardial infarction (MI) 
incidence6, 7, 31. We also hypothesized that an improvement in the walking environment

 would be related to reduced progression of subclinical disease. It has been shown that 
changes in walking environments are related to change in physical activity and changes in 
BMI over time50, 51. However these studies relied on objective measures of the built 
environment features rather than survey measures, as used in the analyses reported here. 
Studies with improved measurement of the social and walking environments are needed to 
draw firmer conclusions regarding the possible effects of these domains on changes in 
subclinical disease.
Our study has several strengths. It is the first study to examine if changes in neighborhood 
characteristics influence the progression of CAC. It included a diverse sample from six 
different sites across the US. It included detailed time-varying measures of neighborhood 
environments and state-of-the-art assessments of subclinical atherosclerosis. The study also 
has several limitations. We used a one-mile buffer size for our neighborhood measures; 
however, relevant buffer sizes could be different for different exposures, for example healthy 
food versus physical activity versus social engagement, and different distances may be 
relevant for different individuals52. Additionally, the study does not have information on 
whether participants actually use the nearby healthy food or physical activity resources and 
we did not include other neighborhood environment variables such as green space or 
aesthetic quality, or objectively-measured crime rates. Workplace environments may have 
been more relevant for those participants who worked and we did not characterize the 
neighborhood environment around participant workplaces. We explored a range of 
neighborhood-level variables, however correlations between variables and power limitations 
inherent in the fixed effects approach (which relies only on within subject variability) 
precluded meaningful analyses of their “independent effects”. We also did not account for 
multiple testing in our models and comparisons.
The fixed effects models that we used adjust for measured and unmeasured person specific 
covariates related to residential location but residual confounding due to unmeasured time-
varying covariates cannot be ruled out. Changes in densities may also be proxying other 
environmental changes related to subclinical disease. Prior work has documented changes in 
CAC associated with aging comparable with the strength of the associations that we 
observed between a 1 SD increase in healthy food availability and changes in CAC53. Thus 
our estimates of effects seem plausible. However, caution should be used in interpreting our 
results as causal and further replication is needed before drawing major public health 
implications from this study.
The results from this longitudinal study provide new evidence that greater access to 
neighborhood healthy food resources may slow the development of coronary atherosclerosis 
in middle-aged and older adults. Our findings support the need to consider neighborhood 
and environmental interventions in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Future research 
should examine the impact on cardiovascular risk of specific interventions such as 
promoting the location of healthy food stores and how neighborhood characteristics may 
interact with individual level factors including genetic predispositions.

 Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
•
Neighborhood deprivation is thought to impact subclinical 
atherosclerosis, but prior studies have not identified what aspects of 
deprived neighborhoods were driving the association.
•
This is the first prospective study to investigate associations of changes 
in neighborhood factors with the progression of subclinical 
atherosclerosis.
•
Using 5,950 adult participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis (MESA) over a 12 ear follow-up period, this study 
investigated whether social and physical neighbourhood characteristics 
are related to progression of subclinical atherosclerosis using coronary 
artery calcium.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
•
Our analysis identified that greater access to neighborhood healthy 
food resources may slow the development of coronary atherosclerosis 
in middle-aged and older adults.
•
Our findings have important implications for the need for policy 
changes to support the increase in neighborhood density of healthy 
food stores.
