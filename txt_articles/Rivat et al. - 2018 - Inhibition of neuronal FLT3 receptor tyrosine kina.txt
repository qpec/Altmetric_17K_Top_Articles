Peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) is a debilitating and intractable chronic disease, for which
sensitization of somatosensory neurons present in dorsal root ganglia that project to the
dorsal spinal cord is a key physiopathological process. Here, we show that hematopoietic
cells present at the nerve injury site express the cytokine FL, the ligand of fms-like tyrosine
kinase 3 receptor (FLT3). FLT3 activation by intra-sciatic nerve injection of FL is sufficient to
produce pain hypersensitivity, activate PNP-associated gene expression and generate short-
term and long-term sensitization of sensory neurons. Nerve injury-induced PNP symptoms
and associated-molecular changes were strongly altered in Flt3-deficient mice or reversed
after neuronal FLT3 downregulation in wild-type mice. A first-in-class FLT3 negative allosteric
modulator, discovered by structure-based in silico screening, strongly reduced nerve injury-
induced sensory hypersensitivity, but had no effect on nociception in non-injured animals.
Collectively, our data suggest a new and specific therapeutic approach for PNP.

 P
eripheral neuropathic pain (PNP), for which specific and
effective therapies are lacking, is a broad public health
problem particularly due to its high prevalence (estimated
to be 6.9–10% in the general population1), debilitating effects, and
its high social cost2,3. Currently, PNP treatments consist essen-
tially in repurposed anti-depressant drugs (e.g., tricyclic anti-
depressants and serotonin-noradrenaline uptake inhibitors) and
anti-epileptic drugs of the class of α2δ−1 voltage-gated calcium
channels blockers, both having poor efficacy and producing
several side effects4. There is a crucial need for specific PNP
medications, which requires the identification of new specific
targets implicated in the initiation and maintenance of PNP.
PNP arises from aberrant functioning of somatosensory neu-
rons present in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) that project to the
dorsal spinal cord (DSC)5,6. Environmental stimuli are converted
into voltage changes in somatosensory neurons by ionic trans-
ducer channels that respond to specific thermal, mechanical, and
chemical stimuli and activate sodium channels that generate and
propagate action potentials to the DSC. Nerve injury rapidly
induces peripheral sensitization due to reduced thresholds of both
transducers and voltage-activated channels, increasing respon-
siveness to stimuli, and axonal hyperexcitability7,8. Within hours,
multiple adaptive modifications occur in the DRG, including gene
expression changes, post-translational protein alterations, and
modifications of protein trafficking. For example, after nerve
damage, TRPV1, a member of the TRP transducer family9, with a
well-established role in inflammatory pain, is upregulated in
different models of PNP both at DRG peripheral and central
synapses. This upregulation is correlated with the development
and the maintenance of thermal hypersensitivity10. In addition,
decreasing TRPV1 levels or inhibiting its activity reduces part of
the neuropathic hypersensitivity11,12. Peripheral sensitization
leads to central sensitization in the DSC that is the cornerstone of
PNP chronification. Currently, how peripheral sensitization
develops and persists is incompletely understood.
Neuro-immune interactions are key regulators of local per-
ipheral sensitization13,14. They are mediated by immune cells,
which invade the lesion site after nerve blood barrier permeabi-
lization, secrete sensitizers (cytokines, chemokines, growth fac-
tors) that contribute to the development of the nerve injury-
induced hypersensitivity and the maintenance of PNP13,14.
Cytokines and their receptors have been identified as important
actors in these interactions15. Among them, with the notable
exception of the cytokine FL16,17 and its cognate receptor FLT318,
all the members of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
family, which comprises stem cell factor (SCF) receptor (c-Kit),
colony-stimulating factor type-I (CSF1) receptor (CSF1R), and
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors (PDGFR) have
been shown to be involved in normal nociception and/or
pain19–22. For example, nerve injury induces de novo neuronal
expression of CSF1, which is transported to the DSC where it
targets CSF1R expressed by microglia cells19. Microglia activation
is considered as a major factor in central PNP chronification13,14.
However,
the
mechanism
leading
to
CSF1
induction
is
unidentified.
FLT3 is expressed in most hematopoietic organs, such as
spleen, thymus, peripheral blood and bone marrow, and its gain-
of-function mutation promotes hematopoietic cells proliferation
that is targeted for therapy of hematologic cancers23. However,
Flt3KO mice have a normal number of mature hematopoietic cells
in all hematopoietic organs, even though some discrete popula-
tions of cell progenitors, but not more mature cells, are reduced24.

 Flt3 transcripts are expressed in various regions of the nervous
system, in particular in human and mice DRGs25–28. FLT3
modulates the in vitro survival of embryonic mice DRG neu-
rons28 but its role in the adult nervous system is not known. Here
we demonstrate that neuronal FLT3 in DRG is a critical actor for
PNP initiation and maintenance in different mouse models. In
addition, we show that PNP can be alleviated by specific FLT3
inhibition using a new chemical entity, thus identifying a novel
therapeutic strategy for PNP treatment.
Results
FL induces PNP-related behavioral and molecular changes. We
used the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model in mice as a
model of persistent PNP, consisting in three chronic ligatures tied
loosely around the sciatic nerve29. On longitudinal sections of
sciatic nerve 10 days after nerve injury, intense FL immunor-
eactivity was present in the nerve at the site of injury in CCI mice,
whereas it was absent in normal, sham-operated nerve. All of the
FL-positive cells also expressed CD45, a marker of the immune
hematopoietic lineage30 (Fig. 1a, b; Supplementary Fig. 1a).
Further analysis showed that 60% of the FL-positive cell popu-
lation express CD11b, a marker of myeloid cells, but not CD68, a
marker of macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). No co-
localization was found with CD3, a marker of T lymphocytes
(Supplementary Fig. 1d). Therefore, FL-expressing cells that
penetrate the nerve at the lesion site can be identified as mono-
cytes, neutrophils, and/or natural killer cells but not macrophages
or T lymphocytes.
To assess whether FL could participate in the generation of
PNP symptoms, uninjured mice were injected intrathecally with
recombinant FL and their sensitivity to mechanical stimulation of
the hind-paw was measured. A single FL injection induced a
dose-dependent increase in the percentage of paw withdrawal to a
calibrated von Frey filament (Fig. 1c), i.e., mechanical hypersen-
sitivity, a hallmark of PNP31, which was present 5 h post-injection
and persisted for at least 2 days. In a separate experiment, the
onset of FL-induced mechanical pain hypersensitivity was
determined to be 120 min: the percentage of paw withdrawal
after an intrathecal injection of 500 ng of FL were (means ± s.e.m.,
n = 8) 31.3 ± 4.5, 18.8 ± 2.6 and 51.3 ± 3.2% at 30, 90 and 120 min
post-FL injection, respectively, whereas those after saline injection
were 30.0 ± 3.7, 21.3 ± 3.4, and 21.3 ± 3.9% (P < 0.0001 for
comparison of FL vs. saline at 120 min by two-way ANOVA,
not significant at other time points).
FL-injected mice also displayed thermal hypersensitivity in
response to cold and hot stimuli (Fig. 1d). Mice with a
homozygous deletion of Flt3 (Flt3KO mice) failed to develop
mechanical hypersensitivity following FL injection (Fig. 1e),
whereas they displayed normal proportions of sensory neurons
expressing typical molecular markers, motor behaviors, and
pain responses to nociceptive stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b).
This indicates that FL-induced hypersensitivity resulted from
activation of its cognate FLT3 receptor. Repeated injections
of FL every 2 days during 10 days maintained mechanical
hypersensitivity that persisted as long as the treatment continued
(Fig. 1f).

 We next examined changes in nerve injury-associated genes in
DRG and DSC. Twenty-four hours after a single FL injection,
expression levels in DRG of the stress-induced gene transcript
Atf332
and
several
important
neuronal
pain-related
gene
transcripts, e.g., neuropeptide Y (NpY)33 and transient receptor
potentials TrpV134 and TrpA135 were increased (Fig. 1g).
Expression levels of PNP-associated gene transcripts in the DSC
at this time point (24 h) showed no change compared to saline-
injected animals (Fig. 1g). In contrast, repeated injections of FL
over 10 days caused striking changes in the DSC expression of
genes associated with the process of central pain sensitization36,
notably the activated microglia markers Iba1 and Cd11b37 and
the activated astrocyte marker Gfap38 (Fig. 1g). Thus, FLT3
activation causes, in the short-term, upregulation of PNP-related
genes in the DRG, and in the long-term, molecular changes in the
DSC typical of those occurring during chronification of PNP.
In cultured DRG neurons, application of capsaicin, a specific
TRPV1 agonist, increased intracellular Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) and
repeated capsaicin applications attenuated TRPV1 responses,
which reflects receptor desensitization (Fig. 2a)39. FL alone had
no effect on basal [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2b), but markedly potentiated, in a
concentration-dependent
manner,
the
TRPV1
response
to
repeated capsaicin applications (Fig. 2b). Although the capsaicin
response was normal in cultures established from Flt3KO mice,
the potentiating effect of FL was completely abolished (Fig. 2c).
Similarly to its effect on TRPV1 function, FL potentiated both the
[Ca2+]i response to cinnamaldehyde and menthol, specific
activators of TRPA1 and of TRPM8 channels, respectively
(Fig. 2d). Voltage-clamp whole-cell recording confirmed that
capsaicin-induced TRPV1 currents were effectively potentiated by
FLT3 activation (Fig. 2e, f). Furthermore, hind-paw FL injection
also potentiated capsaicin-induced spontaneous pain-related
behaviors (Fig. 2g).
Thus, acute and chronic in vivo FLT3 activation by FL
recapitulates in mice some of the molecular and functional
changes in sensory neurons and behavioral alterations that are
normally induced by peripheral nerve injury. Altogether, these
data strongly suggest that FL directly acts on primary sensory
neurons. Indeed, injection of FL directly into the sciatic nerve, but
not systemic FL augmentation by intravenous injection (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3a, b), caused mechanical hypersensitivity, showing
that systemic peripheral activation of FLT3 is not involved in pain
behavior. This indicates that FLT3 triggering PNP-like symptoms
is present in the nerve and/or DRG. In agreement with this
observation, Western blot detected FLT3 in DRG tissue from WT,
but not Flt3KO mice, (Supplementary Fig. 3c) and Flt3 mRNA was
visualized in DRG neurons by in situ hybridization (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3d).
Neuronal FLT3 controls PNP development and maintenance.
Considering the similarities in the effects of FLT3 activation and
those induced by peripheral nerve injury, we then asked whether
downregulation of FLT3 functioning could influence the mole-
cular, cellular, and behavioral responses to nerve injury. In the
CCI model, injury of the sciatic nerve produced mechanical
hypersensitivity that lasted for more than 2 months in WT mice,
whereas Flt3KO mice failed to develop pain-related behavior over
the same period (Fig. 3a). Note that the repetition of painful
mechanical stimulus applications is unlikely to produce sensiti-
zation or tolerance since the maximal change in paw withdrawal
threshold was achieved after 2 weeks and was maintained over
time until the end of the experiment. The heat hypersensitivity
and mechanical allodynia observed in WT mice after CCI were
also absent in Flt3KO mice (Fig. 3b, c). The conditioned place
preference paradigm has been used to reveal the presence of non-

 evoked ongoing pain in nonverbal animals40. Administration of
the non-rewarding and rapidly-acting analgesic drug clonidine,
referred to as clonidine-induced analgesia, produced a place
preference in wild-type CCI animals, which was totally abolished
in Flt3KO CCI mice (Fig. 3d), suggesting a loss of non-evoked
ongoing pain in Flt3KO mice. Furthermore, the results on nerve
injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity could be extended to
different PNP models, the spared nerve injury (SNI)41 and spinal
nerve ligation (SNL)42 models, and also to the oxaliplatin model
of chemotherapy-induced generalized PNP (Fig. 3e–g). Never-
theless, Flt3KO mice have normal responses to chemically-
induced nociception in the formalin test and in the complete
Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) chronic inflammatory pain model
(Supplementary Fig. 4a, b).
We next assessed whether the deletion of Flt3 could modulate
the expression of pain-related factors induced by nerve injury
involved in peripheral and central sensitization responsible for
PNP chronification14. The injury-induced increases in transcripts
of Atf3, NpY, TrpV1, and Gfap in DRG and Iba1, Cd11b in DSC
were abrogated or diminished after Flt3 deletion, at 3 days post-
CCI (Fig. 4a). These variations were confirmed by immunochem-
istry analysis, showing that, in DRG, Flt3 deletion inhibited the
injury-induced increases in ATF3, NPY, and GFAP, seen in WT
mice at 14 days post-CCI (Fig. 4b, c). In DSC, Flt3 deletion also
diminished nerve injury-induced changes of astrocyte (GFAP)
and a similar trend was seen for microglial (IBA1) activation
markers (Fig. 4d, e). Flt3 deletion in CCI mice attenuated the
upregulation of Csf1 ligand transcript in DRG and Csf1R in DSC
(Fig. 4f). These results were confirmed by the quantification of
reduced numbers of DRG CSF1-positive cells using immunohis-
tochemistry (Fig. 4g, h). Finally, intrathecal CSF1 injection
induced mechanical hypersensitivity in both WT and Flt3KO mice
(Fig. 4i), suggesting that FLT3 acts upstream of CSF1/CSF1R, a
major signaling pathway in neuropathic pain chronification19.

 intrathecally Flt3-directed siRNA in CCI mice via mini-pumps
during a 6-day period starting 8 days after the nerve injury. Flt3-
siRNA (but not scrambled siRNA) effectively down-regulated Flt3
expression in vitro and FLT3 function ex vivo (Supplementary
Fig. 5a–c), as well as CCI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity
(Fig. 5a), without affecting normal mechanical nociception
(Supplementary Fig. 5d). These changes were accompanied by
reductions of PNP-related mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 5e) and
protein levels, as shown by reductions in numbers of cells
expressing ATF3, NPY, and GFAP in the DRG (Fig. 5b, c). To
determine whether neuronal FLT3 in DRG is necessary and
sufficient to regulate PNP symptoms, we constructed an AAV9
virus vector co-expressing an Flt3 shRNA (Flt3-sh) and the green
fluorescence protein (GFP). When injected intrathecally, virus-
derived GFP expression in DRG was restricted to neurons
(Fig. 5d) and in DSC appeared only in fiber-like processes, most
likely originating from sensory neuron projections. GFP expres-
sion was not present in DSC cell bodies (Supplementary 6a, b).
Following reduction of FLT3 protein levels in the DRG after
treatment with the Flt3-directed shRNA-expressing AAV9 virus
(Supplementary Fig. 6c, d), intrathecal FL injections failed to
produce evoked mechanical pain hypersensitivity (Fig. 5e), as well
as increase pain score, which takes into account pain-related
behaviors (Fig. 5f), thus showing that the effect of FL is exerted
directly via neuronal FLT3. Furthermore, Flt3-directed shRNA
largely reduced percentage of withdrawal in CCI mice, whereas an
AAV9 virus expressing a non-targeting shRNA had no effect
(Fig. 5g). Thus, inhibition of Flt3 expression reduced mechanical
pain hypersensitivity produced by either FL injection or nerve
injury. Altogether, these results show that PNP symptoms
induced by peripheral nerve injury are mediated by FLT3
expressed in DRG neurons and that PNP, once established, can be
reversed by acute downregulation of Flt3 gene expression.
BDT001, an FLT3 inhibitor, reverses PNP symptoms. The X-
ray structure of human FL-FLT3 complex23,43 (Fig. 6a) was used
to design a pharmacophore recapitulating all molecular interac-
tions between the FLT3 D3 domain and the N-terminal part (H8-
S13) of the FL ligand. Owing to the surprisingly compact FL-
binding epitope (FL-FLT3 interface area of 749 Å2), the FL–FLT3
interaction pharmacophore (Fig. 6b) is simple enough to be fitted
by small molecular weight compounds. In silico screening of ca. 3
million commercially available compounds afforded 221 unique
compounds fulfilling the pharmacophore, out of which 28 che-
mically representative hits (Fig. 6c; Supplementary Table 1) were
selected for purchase.
One compound (compound Hit #3, Fig. 6d, e) effectively
prevented extracellular FL binding to FLT3, as measured by time-
resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (trFRET, see
Supplementary Fig. 7a, b for binding assay validation). Among
the 21 commercial and close structural analogs of compound 3
(Supplementary Table 2), seven compounds were more potent
than parent compound 3 in the competition binding assay
(Supplementary Fig. 8a). Notably compounds 66 and 75 inhibited
FL binding to FLT3 with IC50 values of 11 and 17 µM,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Binding affinities of the 21
analogs permitted to establish preliminary structure–activity
relationships (SAR) on the chemical series (Supplementary
Fig. 8b). After in-house synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 9a),

 compound 66 (hereafter referred to as BDT001, Fig. 6e) was
confirmed as a true FLT3 inhibitor, which inhibited FL binding in
a non-competitive manner and disrupted positive cooperativity of
FL binding (Fig. 6f). BDT001 inhibited FL-induced FLT3
phosphorylation in leukemia-derived RS4–11 cells, also measured
by trFRET (see Supplementary Fig. 7a, b for phosphorylation
assay validation) with an IC50 of 18–24 µM that was almost
unchanged with increasing FL concentrations (Fig. 6g). These
results suggest that BDT001 is an FLT3 negative allosteric
modulator.
In primary cultures of adult DRG neurons, BDT001 affected
neither capsaicin-induced TRPV1 activation (Fig. 7a) nor basal
[Ca2+]i (Fig. 7b), but reversed in a dose-dependent manner the
potentiation by FL, with a maximal effect at 1 µM, and a partial
effect at 0.1 µM (Fig. 7b). Thus, the effective BDT001 concentra-
tion required for functional inhibition of FLT3 in neurons was
significantly lower than that required for inhibiting FL binding
and FL-induced FLT3 auto-phosphorylation in RS4–11 cells.
Among the rare examples of extracellular RTK inhibitors, two
similar situations have already been encountered (Supplementary
Note 1). The effect of BDT001 was FLT3-dependent, as the
compound at 10 µM had no effect when TRPV1 potentiation was
induced by NGF (Fig. 7c).
After systemic administration of BDT001 (5 mg/kg i.p.) in
mice, FL-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was completely
abrogated (Fig. 7d). In the CCI model, a single injection of
BDT001 (5 mg/kg i.p.) reversed mechanical hypersensitivity
for 2 days (Fig. 8a). As compared to pregabalin, a standard of
care for PNP, BDT001 produced longer effects when considering
either paw withdrawal thresholds (Fig. 8b) or pain-related
behaviors (Fig. 8c). Repeated injections of BDT001 every day
during 3 days fully reversed mechanical allodynia as long as the
treatment continued (Fig. 8d). In agreement with the data on
Flt3KO mice, BDT001 did not change CFA-induced inflammatory
mechanical
pain
hypersensitivity
(Fig.
8e).
Neither
sensory–motor functions in naive mice (Fig. 8f) nor body weight
in nerve-injured mice (Fig. 8g) were affected by single and
repeated BDT001 (5 mg/kg i.p.) injections during 4 days,
respectively. In a preliminary pharmacokinetics study, the
BDT001 plasma level reached 0.19 ± 0.06 µM (N = 3), 30 min
after administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg i.p.
Tested at a concentration of 10 µM, BDT001 shows a high
selectivity for the FLT3 kinase as neither binding to 25 diverse

effects on 49 intracellular kinases (Supplementary Table 4)
could be demonstrated, with the exception of Interleukin-1

was detected. Apart from a poor metabolic stability (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 9b), BDT001 exhibits promising properties suggesting
that
the clinical development
of close analogs is indeed
feasible.

 Discussion
Using different approaches aimed at selectively activating or
inhibiting neuronal FLT3 signaling, we disclose a novel role for
neuronal FLT3 as a master hub protein mediating neuro-immune
interactions known to be crucial in PNP physiopathology13.
Indeed, disruption of the blood–nerve barrier produced by nerve
injury seems to be responsible for the presence of CD45 positive
FL-expressing hematopoietic cells at the site of nerve lesion. We
demonstrate that sensory neuron FLT3 is necessary and sufficient
for the development and maintenance of the PNP state. Activa-
tion of FLT3 by exogenous FL in mice mimics many aspects of
nerve injury-induced PNP, i.e., mechanical and thermal hyper-
sensitivity,
pain-related
behaviors,
rapid
upregulation
and
potentiation of TRP family transducers in the DRG (likely
involving phosphorylation7) that may lead to neuron hyper-
excitability, and delayed transcriptional modifications in the DSC
that have been reported to be associated with central pain sen-
sitization. Disruption of FLT3 functioning by various means, e.g.,
gene deletion, small interfering RNAs, an AAV9 virus vector
expressing Flt3 shRNA into neurons or a newly designed inhi-
bitor, reverse changes associated with PNP, without affecting
normal sensory–motor system functioning. Our results also show
that FLT3 signaling modulates the expression of the cytokine
CSF1, known to activate microglial cells in the DSC19, a key
process in central sensitization thought to underlie PNP main-
tenance. Hence, FLT3 in sensory neurons appears as a key
upstream trigger and controller of PNP.
FLT3 activation by FL indeed requires peripheral nerve lesion,
rupture of the blood–nerve barrier and presence of FL-expressing
cells. Thus, our data demonstrate that FLT3 is involved in nerve
injury-induced hyperalgesia and pain sensitization, but not in
normal nociception nor in inflammatory pain, which does not
involve nerve lesion. We have therefore discovered a specific
therapeutic target for PNP.
Many high-affinity inhibitors targeting the intracellular ATP-
binding site of the FLT3 kinase domain have been developed and
are currently under clinical evaluation for the treatment of FLT3-
mutated acute myeloid leukemia44,45. However, even the most
potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor to date (quizartinib) still inhibits
several other receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., c-KIT, RET, PDGFRB,
CSF1R) at single digit nanomolar concentrations46. Severe side
effects associated with the therapeutic use of existing FLT3 inhibi-
tors are acceptable in oncology patients, but not in PNP patients in
the perspective of a long-lasting treatment. Using a structure-based
virtual screening approach, we targeted the unique extracellular
FL–FLT3 interface. This strategy of extracellular RTK inhibition47
by low-molecular weight compounds was shown to be successful in
at least two examples in which potent TrkB48 and FGFR49 extra-
cellular negative allosteric modulators were discovered. We have
identified a low-molecular weight compound (BDT001) as an FLT3
negative allosteric modulator that specifically inhibits FL binding
and blocks FL-induced FLT3 receptor phosphorylation with mod-
erate potency (ca. 10–20 µM) in artificial in vitro assays. However,
BDT001 exhibits a much higher potency for inhibiting FL-induced
effects in DRG neurons, e.g., TRPV1 potentiation compared to
inhibition of binding and phosphorylation in RS4–11 cells. The
concentrations of BDT001 needed to inhibit TRPV1 potentiation
(0.1 µM) are similar to those reached in plasma after systemic
administration at a dose that also produces robust anti-hyperalgesic
and anti-allodynic effects in an PNP model in mice. At this low
concentration, BDT001 does not affect any kinase binding (23
receptor tyrosine kinases tested) nor functional activity (49 kinases
tested) and therefore seems to display the needed pharmacological
selectivity.
Indeed,
BDT001
completely
inhibits
FL-induced
mechanical hypersensitivity, an effect shown here to be depen-
dent on FLT3 activation. This may suggest that BDT001 is a potent
agent against PNP, due to the particular environment of neuronal
FLT3 not present in the myeloid cell line RS4–11, or to the high
sensitivity of PNP mechanisms to FLT3 inhibition. Thus, although
the precise molecular mode of interaction of BDT001 with FLT3
remains to be elucidated, this compound represents a prototypical
selective FLT3 inhibitor. Remarkably, BDT001 has anti-hyperalgesic
effects without altering sensory–motor functions, such as nocicep-
tive sensitivity or motor balance and coordination, which supports
the selectivity of the compound. Furthermore, BDT001 does not
affect inflammatory pain hypersensitivity, which suggests that
BDT001 or an analog may be a specific treatment for PNP.
Moreover, the effects of BDT001 last 48 h after a single adminis-
tration. Such a long-lasting effect, in spite of rapid decrease in
plasma drug levels, may be due to the compound remaining in a
somatosensory compartment or locked in an FLT3 inactive con-
formation after its elimination from the systemic circulation.
Another more likely hypothesis is that this long-lasting effect, may
be due to prolonged inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation, as was
shown in the case of in vivo administration of the small-molecule
FLT3 inhibitor sunitinib in a tumor xenograft model50.
By specifically targeting the upstream trigger and controller of
PNP, the novel FLT3-based therapy may be more efficacious than

 current therapies targeting either non-specific PNP mechanisms
(e.g., anti-epileptics or antidepressants), or mechanisms operating
on narrow aspects of PNP, such as excitability of sensory neurons
(e.g., voltage-dependent sodium channel blockers) or inflamma-
tion (e.g., interleukins or chemokines inhibitors).
In conclusion, our data support peripheral sensory neuron
FLT3 as an innovative and specific target for PNP management.
BDT001, a rationally designed FLT3 negative allosteric mod-
ulator, is consequently a novel prototypical therapeutic tool to
alleviate PNP symptoms.
Methods
Animals. Experiments were performed in C57BL/6 naive mice (Janvier, France) or
mice carrying a homozygous deletion of Flt3 (Flt3KO mice)24 and their littermates
(WT) weighing 25–30 g. All the procedures were approved by the French Ministry
of Research (authorization #1006). Animals were maintained in a climate-controlled
room on a 12 h light/dark cycle and allowed access to food and water ad libitum.
Male and female mice were first considered separately in behavioral procedures.
Both sexes showed mechanical hypersensitivity of same intensity after intrathecal FL
injection and nerve injury and were similarly affected by Flt3 deletion (ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni’s test, n = 8 for both sexes and genotypes for each experi-
ment). Thereafter, experiments were performed only on male mice.
Chronic pain models. Four different models of peripheral neuropathic pain and
one model of chronic inflammatory pain were used. All surgical procedures were
performed under deep isoflurane anesthesia.
The CCI model was performed as described previously29 and adapted for
mice51. Briefly, skin was incised and the sciatic nerve was exposed unilaterally at
the mild-high level by dissecting through the biceps femoris. Three ligations (catgut
6.0) were loosely tied around the sciatic nerve with about 1 mm spacing to reduce
blood flow. The skin was then closed with staples. In sham-operated animals the
sciatic nerve was exposed without ligation.
The SNI procedure was performed as already described41. Briefly, the three
terminal branches of the sciatic nerve were exposed after incision of the lateral
surface of the thigh through the biceps femoris muscle. Then, the common
peroneal and the tibial nerves were tightly ligated with 6.0 silk thread and sectioned
distal to the ligation. The sural nerve was left intact.
The SNL procedure was performed as described previously42. Briefly, the L6
transverse process was removed to expose the L4 and L5 spinal nerves. The
L5 spinal nerve was then isolated and tightly ligated with 6.0 silk thread. For sham
operations, the L5 spinal nerve was exposed but not ligated.
The induction of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy was performed
according to Descoeur et al.52 Oxaliplatin (3 mg/kg) was dissolved in saline and
intraperitoneally injected in the animals. Sham animals were injected with an
equivalent volume of saline.
The model of complete Freund adjuvant (CFA)-induced pain53 has been used
for assessing chronic inflammatory pain. Briefly, under isoflurane anesthesia, an
intraplantar injection (20 µl) of a solution of 1 mg of mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Sigma-Aldrich) per ml was performed in the left hind-paw of wild-type or Flt3KO
animals.
Behavioral testing. Before testing, mice were acclimatized for 60 min in the
temperature and light-controlled testing room within a plastic cylinder or on wire
mesh. Experimenters were blinded to the genotype or the drug administered.
Three different types of tests were performed to evaluate mechanical sensitivity.
A 0.6 g-von Frey filament was used to test hind-paw mechanical
hypersensitivity. Sharp withdrawal of the stimulated hind-paw was considered as a
positive response. The procedure was applied 10 times and the percentage of
positive responses was calculated. According to Ducourneau et al.54, we quantified
pain-related behaviors in response to mechanical stimulation by recording a pain
score as followed. 0; no withdrawal, 1; movements of the toes without withdrawal,
2; slow withdrawal, 3; sharp withdrawal, 4; withdrawal with nociceptive behaviors
such as flinching, shaking/or licking. Tactile withdrawal threshold was also
determined in response to probing of the hind-paw with eight calibrated von Frey

 filaments (Stoeling, Wood Dale, IL, USA) in logarithmically spaced increments
ranging from 0.41 to 15 g (4–150 mN). Filaments were applied perpendicularly to
the plantar surface of the paw. The 50% paw withdrawal threshold was determined
in grams by the Dixon nonparametric test55. The protocol was repeated until three
changes in behavior occurred. In the dynamic von Frey procedure, animals were
placed on a metal mesh surface in an enclosed area. A stainless steel filament (0.5
mm diameter) was automatically applied to the hind-paw. The filament exerted an
increasing force to the plantar surface until paw withdrawal. The latency until
withdrawal, in seconds, and the force, in grams, at which the paw was withdrawn
were recorded.
For assessing cold sensitivity, acetone (60 µl) was applied first on the left hind-
paw for all animals then on the right hind-paw. The time spent licking or biting the
paw was recorded with a stopwatch and reported as the cumulative time of licking/
biting for the two hindpaws. A cut-off time of 45 s was used in each trial.
For assessing heat sensitivity, a radiant heat source (plantar test Apparatus, IITC
Life Science, Woodland Hills, USA) was focused onto the plantar surface of the paw.
The paw withdrawal latency was recorded and nociceptive behaviors were scored as
followed: 1: no reaction, 2; paw withdrawal, 3; sharp withdrawal with shaking or
licking of the paw. Each paw was tested 3 times with 10 min-intervals between each
trial. A maximal cut-off of 20 s was used to prevent tissue damage. The data are
expressed as paw withdrawal latency or pain score calculated by dividing the paw
withdrawal latency by the score of nociceptive behavior measured for each animal.
Intraplantar capsaicin (10 µl of a solution at 5 µM in 1%-DMSO) was
performed in unanaesthetized mice. Immediately after the injection, each animal
was observed for 20 min and spontaneous pain-related behaviors were evaluated
through the time spent in shaking and licking the injected hind-paw. Data are
represented as the duration of the responses. After a first injection of capsaicin
associated with intrathecal saline or FL (500 ng/10 µl), capsaicin injection was
repeated three times, 30 min, 3 h, and 24 h after the first injection.
The model of formalin-induced pain56,57 was used to assess acute inflammatory
pain as followed. In wild-type or Flt3KO unanaesthetized mouse, an intraplantar
injection (10 µl) of 2.5% formalin was performed in the left hind-paw. Spontaneous
nociceptive behaviors were evaluated for 45 min by measuring the time spent in
shaking and licking the injected hind-paw. Data are expressed as duration of
responses every 5 min.
In the Rotarod test, the speed was set at 10 rpm for 60 s and subsequently
accelerated to 80 rpm over 5 min. The time taken for mice to fall after the
beginning of the acceleration was recorded.
Conditioned place preference (CPP) was performed as follows. Tonic-aversive
state in neuropathic pain can be unmasked by the administration of non-rewarding
and rapidly-acting analgesic drugs such as clonidine. All experiments were
conducted by using the single trial CPP protocol as described previously for
rodents40,58. CPP apparatus (Bioseb, Vitrolles, France) consists of two equally sized
chambers (20 × 18 × 25 cm) interconnected by a rectangular corridor (20 × 7 × 25
cm). The chambers are differentiated by the wall pattern (dotes versus stripes) and
color (different shades of gray versus black). Fourteen days after CCI surgery,
animals went through a 3-day pre-conditioning period with full access to all
chambers for 20 min. On day 3, a pre-conditioning bias test was performed to
determine whether a preexisting chamber bias existed. In this test, mice were
placed into the middle chamber and allowed to explore open field with access to all
chambers for 15 min. No animal spending more than 80% or <20% of the total
time in an end chamber was found and all animals tested were retained for this
CPP experiment. On conditioning day (day 4), mice first received intrathecal saline
(10 µl) paired with a randomly chosen chamber in the morning. Four hours later,
the same animals received intrathecal clonidine (10 µg/10 µl.) paired with the other
chamber in the afternoon. Conditioning sessions lasted 15 min, each mice did not
have access to the other chamber. On the test day (d5), 20 h after the afternoon
pairing, mice were placed in the middle chamber of the CPP box with all doors
open so animals could have free access to all chambers. The time spent in each
chamber was recorded for 20 min for analysis of chamber preference.
Drug delivery. BDT001 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or pregabalin (10 mg/kg, i.p., R&D Systems
Europe, France) was administered intraperitoneally. For continuous siRNA intra-
thecal delivery, a polyurethane catheter (Alzet #0007743) with the following spe-
cifications: 2.5 cm 32 G (0.23 mm OD; 0.09 mm ID) connected to 1 cm (0.76 mm
OD; 0.38 mm ID), connected to a 2.5 cm (1.02 mm OD; 0.61 mm ID) ALZET
connection with Teflon-coated stylet wire was inserted into the subarachnoid space
between S1 and L6 level and anchored with histoacryl tissue adhesive to L6 ver-
tebrae and attached to muscles surrounded the spine with 4.0 silk suture. After a 7
day-recovery period, the minipump was connected to the catheter and implanted
into the dorsal subcutaneous space. Behavioral experiments were performed
10 days after minipump (Model 1002, Alzet Osmotic pump, Charles River)
implantation. For FL or virus acute intrathecal injection, a 30 G needle attached to
a microsyringe was inserted between L4 and L5 vertebrae in lightly restrained,
unanaesthetized mice. The reflexive tail flick was used to confirm the punction. A
total volume of 10 µl was injected. After intrathecal injection, 2 mice were excluded
from the data analysis because they presented motor dysfunction and/or paralysis.
In Fig. 2g, FL injection was performed in the paw. For intra-nerve injection
(Supplementary Fig. 3a), under isoflurane anesthesia, the left sciatic nerve was
exposed as described above for CCI surgery. A Hamilton syringe (10 µl) was
connected to an electronic pump by polyethylene tubing. To avoid damaging the
nerve we used a 33 G needle to disrupt the epineurium of the sciatic nerve and a
polyurethane tubing (Alzet #0007743) was inserted to slowly deliver the solutions
into the sciatic nerve. One µl of a solution of FL (50 µg/ml) or saline was injected in
mice at a rate of 30 µl/h. After the injection, the skin was closed with staples. After
intrathecal injection, no mouse presented motor dysfunction and all the animals
were retained for the data analysis. In Supplementary Fig. 3b, FL (5 mg/100 µl) was
injected intravenously.
FLT3 transcript knockdown experiments with siRNAs. Scrambled control small
interfering (siRNA) based on the Flt3 sequence and a pool of 4 specific siRNAs
against Flt3 (Flt3-siRNA) were used (On-target Plus SMART pools from Dharmacon,
Perbio Science, Brebières, France; Dharmacon Catalog L-002000-00-0005 targeting
FLT3). Anti-Flt3 siRNA was validated in vitro in HEK293M cells transfected with a
SNAP-tagged-Flt3 cDNA and the relevant siRNA or a control siRNA. HEK293M cells
were maintained in DMEM Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with antibiotics
(penicillin 50 U/ml, streptomycin 50 µg/ml) and 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Calf
Serum. Transfection mixes were prepared using 0.5 µg of mouse SNAP-FLT3 plas-
mid, 9.5 pmol of mouse Flt3-siRNA, 5 µl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and
1000 µl Opti-MEM per well. The SNAP fluorescent signal was detected after incu-
bation with Tb-labeled benzylguanine (100 nM), using an advanced fluorescence
microplate reader (CLARIOstar, BMG Labtech) equipped with a HTRF optic module
allowing a donor excitation at 337 nm and a signal collection both at 620 nm. A
frequency of 300 flashes/well was selected for the lamp excitation. For in vivo
injections, 5 µg of specific or non-specific siRNAs were complexed with 1.8 µl of 200
µM linear low-molecular weight polyethylenimine ExGen 500 (Euromedex, Souffel-
weyersheim, France). Flt3-siRNA (12.53 ng/ml) or a scrambled siRNA was admi-
nistered via osmotic minipump infusion (0.25 µl/h) for 4 days.
Real-time PCR. Mice lumbar (L4–L6) dorsal root ganglia and dorsal spinal cord
were dissected at different stages post-surgery and stored at −80 °C until RNA was
extracted using the RNAqueous-4PCR Kit (Ambion). One µg of total RNA was
reverse-transcribed with 100 U of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen),
5 µM random hexamers (Promega), 0.5 mM of each dNTPs (Promega), 10 mM of
dithiothreitol, and 20 U of recombinant RNase inhibitor (Promega) 1 h at 37 °C.
Real-time PCR was carried out as described previously59 using SYBR Green I dye
detection on the Light Cycler system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR reac-
tions were carried out in 96-well plates in a 10 µl volume containing 3 µl of cDNA
product (final dilution 1/30), 0.5 µM of forward and reverse primers, and 2 µl of
QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Roche Diagnosis). Amplified products
were sequenced at least once (Beckman Coulter Genomics, UK). The relative
amounts of specifically amplified cDNAs calculated on at least three independent
experimental replicates using the delta-CT method59–61 were normalized with
RNA polymerase II polypeptide J (Polr2j) and DEAD box polypeptide 48 (Ddx48)
as stable control genes.

Adult sensory neuron culture. For both whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and
calcium imaging, neuron cultures were established from lumbar (L4–L6) dorsal root
ganglia59. Briefly, ganglia were successively treated by two incubations with col-
lagenase A (1 mg/ml, Roche Diagnostic, France) for 45 min each (37 °C) and
trypsin-EDTA (0.25%, Sigma, St Quentin Fallavier, France) for 30 min. They were
mechanically dissociated through the tip of a fire-polished Pasteur pipette in neu-
robasal (Life Technologies, Cergy-Pontoise, France) culture medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and DNase (50 U/ml, Sigma). Isolated cells were
collected by centrifugation and suspended in neurobasal culture medium supple-
mented with 2% B27 (Life Technologies), 2 mM glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin
(20 U/ml, 0.2 mg/ml) plated at a density of 2500 neurons per coverslip and were

 incubated in a humidified 95% air-5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. We used 6 and 21
animals for path-clamp and calcium imaging experiments, respectively.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from isolated DRG neurons. Whole-cell
voltage-clamp was performed on small and medium somatic diameter (15–25 µm)
DRG neurons after one day in vitro (1 DIV) at 37 °C. Currents were recorded with
an RK-400 amplifier (Biologic) and computed with a Digidata 1322 A analogue
interface (Axon Instruments) and the pClamp software (Clampex 8.02; Axon
Instruments). Signals were filtered at 3 and sampled at 5 kHz. Series resistances
were corrected to 60–80%. The membrane voltage was held at −60 mV. Glass
electrodes (2.5–3.5 MΩ) were made from capillary glass, using a Narishige puller,
and coated with paraffin wax to minimize pipette capacitance. The Standard
External Solution (SES) contained: 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH and
osmolarity between 300 and 310 mOsm). Recording pipettes were filled with the
following solution: 140 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES (pH
adjusted to 7.4 with KOH and osmolarity between 300 and 310 mOsm). Capsaicin
(500 nM-1 µM) and FL (100 nM) were dissolved in extracellular solution.
Sequencial applications were: SES (1 min)—capsaicin 1 (15 s)—SES (3 min)—
capsaicin 2 ± FL (15 s)—SES (3 min)—capsaicin 3 ± FL (15 s)—SES (1 min).
Calcium imaging. For calcium imaging video microscopy [Ca2+]i fluorescence
imaging, DRG neurons were loaded with fluorescent dye 2.5 µM Fura-2 AM
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 min at 37 °C in standard external solution
contained: 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES,
10 mM glucose (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH and osmolarity between 300 and
310 mOsm). The coverslips were placed on a stage of Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted
microscope (Zeiss, München). Observations were made at room temperature
(20–23 °C) with a ×20 UApo/340 objective. Fluorescence intensity at 505 nm with
excitation at 340 and 380 nm were captured as digital images (sampling rates of
0.1–2 s). Regions of interest were identified within the soma from which quanti-
tative measurements were made by re-analysis of stored image sequences using
MetaFluor Ratio Imaging software. [Ca2+]i was determined by ratiometric method
of Fura-2 fluorescence from calibration of series of buffered Ca2+ standards.
Neurons were distinguished from non-neuronal cells by applying 25 mM KCl,
which induced a rapid increase of [Ca2+]i only in neurons. Pulses of capsaicin were
applied at 2 min-intervals and capsaicin and drugs was added after the third pulse.
The same temporal stimulation protocol (Fig. 2a) was used for TRPV1 (capsaicin),
TRPA1 (cinnamaldehyde), and TRPM8 (menthol). To allow visualization of cells
transfected with siRNA (see above for the preparation of siRNA), 3 mM dextran-
tetramethyl rhodamine (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) was added to the 5%
glucose solution containing the RNA–polymer complex.
For data analysis, amplitudes of [Ca2+]i increases, ΔF/Fmax, caused by
stimulation of neurons with capsaicin were measured by subtracting the “baseline”
F/Fmax (mean for 30 s prior to capsaicin addition) from the peak F/Fmax achieved
on exposure to capsaicin. In the absence of any treatment the distribution of these
ratios was well fitted by a normal distribution.
In situ hybridization. Sense and antisense digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probes
were generated from a mouse Flt3 cDNA clone (IRAMp995N1310Q, Genome-
CUBE Source Bioscience) in a 20 µl reaction containing 1 µg of linearized plasmid
(digested with HindIII and NheI, respectively) using the DIG RNA labelling mix
(Roche Diagnostics) and T7 and Sp6 RNA polymerases respectively (Promega)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. DIG-labeled RNA probes were purified
on MicroSpin G50 columns (GE Healthcare). Naive or CCI-injured WT and
Flt3KO mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation.
L4–L6 lumbar dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord were dissected in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS), and fixed for 1 and 3 h, respectively, in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) at room temperature. Tissues were rinsed twice in PBS before immersion
overnight in 25% sucrose/PBS at 4 °C. In situ hybridization was performed with
standard procedures on transverse sections of 14 µm as described62. Image
acquisition was done using a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer using NDP view software.
Virus transfection. The following oligonucleotides were used to build the AAV-
GFP-shRNA plasmids: shFLT3 (GATCGGTGTCGAGCAGTACTCTAAATCAA-
GAGTTTAGAGTACTGCTCGACACCTTTTT (top)); AGCTAAAAAGGTGTC-
GAGCAGTACTCTAAACTCTTGATTTAGAGTACTGCTCGACACC (bottom);
Sigma-Aldrich (TRC00000378670); shcontrol (GATCCAACAAGATGAAGAGC
ACCAATCAAGAGTTGGTGCTCTTCATCTTGTTGTTTTT (top)); AGCTAA
AAACAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAACTCTTGATTGGTGCTCTTCATCTT
GTTG (bottom).
The oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned BamHI–HindIII in a vector
containing the U6 promoter sequence and the hGH polyadenylation sequence
upstream and downstream, respectively, of the BamHI site. The U6-shRNA-hGH
sequences were then cut using PmlI and HpaI and cloned in the pAAV-CMV-GFP
vector (Cell Biolabs Inc.) linearized with PmlI. All the constructs were checked by
DNA sequencing. The viruses were produced by the Viral Vector Production Unit
of Barcelona, Spain. For in vivo experiments, 10 µl of AAV-GFP-shFLT3 or AAV-
GFP-sh control solution were intrathecally injected in lightly restrained,
unanaesthetized mice, as described above. The titer of the virus solution was
5.8 × 1012 genome copies (gc)/ml.
Immunohistochemistry. Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by
4% formaldehyde for all experiments except for the AVV9-GFP ShFLT3 experiment
where mice were perfused with 1% saline buffer. DRG (L4-L6), spinal cord (lumbar
segment), and sciatic nerves were collected and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
between 10 min and 2 h depending on the antibody and tissue before being cryo-
protected in 30% sucrose in PBS. Tissues were then frozen in O.C.T (Sakura
Finetek). Sections (12 μm) were prepared using the Cryostat Leica CM2800E. For
immunostaining, frozen sections were blocked and permeabilized in Ca2+/Mg2
+-free PBS (PBS 1× −/−) containing 10% donkey serum and 0.1% or 0.3% Triton
x-100 during 30 min. The sections were then incubated with primary antibodies, at
4 °C overnight in PBS 1× −/− containing 1% donkey serum and 0.1%, 0.01, or
0.03% Triton x-100. After extensive wash in PBS 1× −/− (3 times for 10 min
minimum each) sections were incubated with appropriate secondary antibody
conjugated to AlexaFluor and Hoechst (Sigma 1 µg/ml), in the same buffer as the
primary antibodies, at room temperature for 1 h and then washing (three times for
15 min each) before mounting with Mowiol. Images were acquired under a Zeiss
LSM 510 and 700 Confocal microscope with ZEN software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy).
Antibodies. The primary antibodies that were used in the study are listed below,
together with manufacturer, catalog number, dilutions used and references to
external publications using the antibodies. Each antibody was validated in the
specific condition and tissue applied in the study by routine controls (omission of
primary or secondary antibody) and by checking that the pattern of immunola-
belling distribution or the number of identified neurons in DRG and DSC corre-
sponds to the published data, for which an abundant literature exists. For instance,
it was checked that immunoreactivity against commonly used glial markers (GFAP,
IBA1) and neurons (TUJ1, NeuN, NPY, CSF1) is restricted to glial cells and
neurons, respectively, as identified by morphometric features. Most of these anti-
bodies have been previously used in our lab conditions62–65. In addition, the anti-
FLT3 antibody, which has not been extensively used, was validated by using Flt3KO
mice (Supplementary Figure 3c).
The following primary antibodies were used: anti-TUJ1 (Sigma T9026 or T2220,
mouse or rabbit 1:1000), anti-ATF3 (Santa Cruz sc-188, rabbit 1:500), anti-NPY
(Cell Signaling 11976S, rabbit 1:500), anti-GFAP (Dako Z0334, rabbit 1:500 in
spinal cord or 1:1000 in DRGs), anti-IBA1 (Wako 019-19741, rabbit 1:500), anti-
CSF1 (R&D System AF416, goat 1:500), anti-CD45 (Millipore 05-1416, rat 1:100),
anti-CD11b (DSHB M1/70.15.11.5.2, rat 1:100), anti-CD3 (BD Pharmagen 555273,

anti-guinea pig AlexaFluor 647, donkey 1:1000, from Jackson Immuno Research.
Immunostaining quantification. The number of neurons expressing the various
molecular markers of sensory neurons (subtypes) was determined by counting cells
with neuronal morphology or in some experiments with TUJ1 immunostaining,
e.g., Fig. 4d. A minimum of six sections from lumbar DRGs were counted from at
least three animals for each genotype or condition. For the GFAP immunostaining
in DRG the same method was used, but a positive signal was recorded when a
neuronal cell body was encircled at least two-thirds by GFAP staining. The total
number of neuronal cells in the DRG were counted to determine a percentage of
GFAP-encircled neuron cell bodies63.
To quantify GFAP and IBA1 immunostaining in the dorsal horn of the spinal
cord, a minimum of 10 sections from lumbar spinal cord were evaluated using Image
J software. A density threshold was set above background level to identify positively
stained structures in each condition or/and genotype. The area occupied by these
structures was measured as positive area. An average percentage of area relative to the
total area of the spinal dorsal horn of the section was obtained for each animal across
the different tissue sections. Four animals have been excluded from the
immunohistochemistry analysis (Fig. 3k, l) because of poor quality of slices.
Western Blot. Mice received an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital and
transcardially perfused with PBS. After isolation, tissues were mechanically
homogenized at 4 °C in NP40 buffer (1% NP40, 150 mM NaCl; 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH = 7.8 and protease inhibitor). Lysates were clarified for 10 min at 4°c at

 12,000×g. After protein quantification using a BCA kit (Thermofisher, France),
lysates were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.
Antibodies: Anti-Flt3 was purchased from Stress Signaling and anti-tubulin from
Sigma. After incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, immunodetection
was performed using chemiluminescent reagent (SuperSignal West Femto-ECL,
Thermofisher). Quantification were done with Image Lab software (Biorad).
Production of human recombinant FL (rh-FLT3-L). Recombinant FL was pro-
duced in the E. coli Rosetta (DE3) strain (Novagen) in our laboratory using the
pET15b-rhFL plasmid according to the protocol described64 with some minor
modifications (see Supplementary Methods, Chemicals and Reagents Materials and
Methods). The rh-FL was checked for endotoxin content using the Pyrogen
Recombinant Factor C endotoxin detection assay from LONZA (Walkersville MD,
USA) and was found free of endotoxins.
Data and statistical analyses. All experiments were randomized. Data are
expressed as the mean ± s.e.m. All sample sizes were chosen based on our previous
studies except for animal studies for which sample size has been estimated via a
power analysis using the G-power software. The power of all target values was 80%
with an alpha level of 0.05 to detect a difference of 50%. Statistical significance was
determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA one-way or two-way for repeated
measures, over time). In all experiments in which a significant result was obtained,
the F test was followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons or
by Dunnett’s post-hoc test to compare with the control group, as appropriate. In
case of two experimental groups, unpaired two-tailed t-test was applied. For cell
counting, and area quantification, statistical analyses were performed using
Mann–Whitney test. The applied statistical tests are specified in each figure legend.
Pharmacophore determination. A FL-FLT3 interaction pharmacophore was
generated starting from the X-ray structure of the FL-FLT3 complex (PDB id
3QS7) using the ‘Receptor-Ligand Pharmacophore Generation’ protocol65 in
DiscoveryStudio v3.1 (Accelrys, San Diego, USA). In the first step, all potential
pharmacophore features of the ligand (FL: H8-S13) were identified. Six standard
pharmacophore features were considered: hydrogen-bond acceptor, hydrogen-
bond donor, positive ionizable, negative ionizable, hydrophobic, and ring aromatic.
In the second step, we pruned all features that did not match observed FL-FLT3
interactions using a set of prefixed topological rules65. Last, an exclusion sphere was
added for each FLT3 residue. The size of the exclusion sphere was proportional to
the number of neighboring protein atoms within a 4–5 Å distance range. The final
pharmacophore was composed of four hydrogen-bond acceptor features, one
hydrogen-bond donor feature and 12 exclusion spheres.
Virtual screening. An in-house developed Bioinfo database66 of 2.9 million
commercially available drug-like compounds (v.2011 release) was first filtered in
Pipeline Pilot v.8.5 (Accelrys) to retrieve molecules with the following properties:
h-bond donor count ≥1, h-bond acceptor count ≥4, number of rotatable bonds
≤10, number of aromatic rings ≥1, polar surface area ≤90Å2 and predicted aqueous
solubility ≥50 μM. The resulting 253,193 compounds were then converted into
three-dimensional coordinates using Corina v.3.1 (Molecular Networks GmbH,
Erlangen, Germany) to yield a total of 343,847 unique isomers. All compounds
were ionized at physiological pH with Filter v.2 (OpenEye Scientific Software, Santa
Fe, USA). A maximum of 250 conformers were generated in DiscoveryStudio for
each compound using the “FAST” parameter settings with an upper energy
threshold of 20 kcal/mol with respect to the global energy minimum. The “Screen
Library” protocol in DiscoveryStudio was used to screen the compound library
against the FLT3-FL interaction pharmacophore model using rigid fitting. A total
of 285 different compounds with a fitness value ≥3.0 were selected and further
clustered by maximum common substructures in MedChemStudio v3.1 (Simula-
tion Plus, Lancaster, U.S.A). A representative compound (best fitness score) of each
of the 28 clusters described by at least 3 compounds was finally selected for pur-
chase and biological evaluation.
