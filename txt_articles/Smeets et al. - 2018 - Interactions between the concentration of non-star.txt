ABSTRACT
Two broiler trials were designed to in-
vestigate the relationship between the concentration of
non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in wheat and 1) its
nutritional value for broilers and 2) the efficacy of ex-
ogenous enzymes. In a balance trial, diets were formu-
lated with 3 wheat cultivars (Rustic and Viscount—
medium NSP, Centenaire—high NSP) and were tested
with or without the addition of an exogenous enzyme
mixture. The diets were fed to 144 male Ross 308 broiler
chickens housed in digestibility cages. Total tract nutri-
ent digestibilities and AMEn were measured from 18 to
22 d of age. In a performance trial, diets were formu-
lated with wheat (medium NSP diet) or with wheat
mixed with rye and barley (high NSP diet) and were
tested with or without the addition of an exogenous
enzyme mixture. The diets were fed to 960 male Ross
308 broilers housed in pens and broiler performance
during starter, grower and finisher periods was mea-
sured.
In the balance trial, wheat cultivar did not affect nu-
trient digestibility or AMEn. Enzyme addition caused a
significant increase in nutrient digestibilities and AMEn
for the diet formulated with the high NSP wheat Cen-
tenaire only. In the performance trial, feeding the high
NSP diet resulted in a higher feed conversion ratio
and lower final body weight compared to the medium
NSP diet. The largest improvements by enzyme addi-
tion were observed in the high NSP diet.
In conclusion, the study was not able to show a con-
sistent relationship between the NSP concentration of
wheat and its nutritional value, but did demonstrate
that the effect of an enzyme mixture on nutrient di-
gestibility or broiler performance depends upon the
NSP concentration in the diet.

INTRODUCTION
Wheat, the third most widely grown cereal in the
world after maize and rice, is an important raw ma-
terial in poultry feed (FAO, 2015). In Europe, wheat
is the most important cereal, and about 40% of wheat
production is used for animal feed (Global Agricultural
Information Network, 2016). Wheat, however, contains
non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), and a plethora of

potential anti-nutritional effects are associated with
the NSP fraction of wheat (Choct and Annison, 1992;
Bedford, 2002). The water-extractable (WE) part of
the NSP can increase the viscosity of the intesti-
nal contents, hence disturbing digestion (Dusel et al.,
1997; Van Campenhout, 2007). Furthermore, the water-
unextractable (WU) NSP in the cell walls can impair
nutrient availability to the animal by blocking the ac-
cess to the cell contents for endogenous digestive en-
zymes, the so-called “cage effect” (Bedford, 2002; Van
Campenhout, 2007).
The concentration, extraction properties (WE or
WU) and structure (substitution of arabinoxylan) of
the NSP in wheat can be highly variable, depending
on many factors such as variety, growing conditions
and post-harvest storage conditions (Carr´
e et al., 2002;
Dornez et al., 2008; Smeets et al., 2014a). As a result,
also the nutritional value of wheat can vary when fed to
broiler chickens (Scott et al., 1998; Choct et al., 1999;
Barteczko et al., 2009).

 INTERACTIONS BETWEEN WHEAT QUALITY AND ENZYMES
2065
To counter the possible anti-nutritional effects caused
by NSP and to improve nutrient digestibility and an-
imal performance, NSP-degrading feed enzymes are
commonly added to wheat-based feed. The efficacy
of feed enzymes is variable, however, and sometimes
no effects are observed (Guti´
errez-Alamo et al., 2008;
Svihus, 2011). In general, it is assumed that enzyme
addition is more effective in low-quality wheat (Choct
et al., 1995; Scott et al., 1998; Huyghebaert and
Sch¨
oner, 1999; Bedford, 2002). The definition of low-
quality wheat is, however, not straightforward. Earlier
research showed a positive relationship between enzyme
efficacy and NSP concentration (Huyghebaert et al.
1999; Smeets et al., 2014a; Smeets et al., 2015) and a
negative relationship between enzyme efficacy and the
arabinose to xylose ratio of arabinoxylan (Huyghebaert
et al., 1999; Smeets et al., 2014a). More research on the
relationship between the chemical composition of the
substrate (in particular the NSP) and enzyme efficacy
is needed to be able to predict the nutritional value
of wheat-based diets and the response of a diet to the
addition of NSP degrading enzymes.
The objectives in the present study were to study
the relationship between the concentration of NSP in
wheat and 1) its nutritional value for broilers and 2)
the efficacy of NSP-degrading enzymes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Birds, Diets, and Management
The broiler balance and performance trial both
started at the same time at the Institute for Agricul-
tural and Fisheries Research (ILVO), Melle, Belgium
and were approved by the ILVO Ethical Committee
(EC no. 2012/186). In total, 1,104 day-old male broiler
chickens (Ross 308) were obtained from a commer-
cial hatchery (Belgabroed NV, Merksplas, Belgium).
The broilers were vaccinated at 1 d of age against
Newcastle disease (Clone 30, spray, Intervet Interna-
tional BV, Boxmeer, the Netherlands) and infectious
bronchitis (Poulvac IB Primer, spray, Pfizer Animal
Health, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium). On d 16, vacci-
nation against Newcastle disease was repeated (Clone
30, drinking water).
Balance Trial The balance trial was carried out with
144 birds, housed in 36 digestibility cages (6 dietary
treatments × 6 replicates, 4 birds/cage during the main
balance period). Three basal diets were formulated with
3 different wheat cultivars: Viscount, Rustic, and Cen-
tenaire. The cultivars were chosen to differ mainly
in NSP concentration. Diets were formulated to meet
breeder’s recommendations (Aviagen, 2009) and in-
cluded a coccidiostaticum (0.5 g/kg Sacox; Salinomycin
sodium; Huvepharma NV, Antwerpen, Belgium) and a
phytase (0.2 g/kg Ronozyme R
� NP; DSM, Heerlen, The
Netherlands). The ingredients and the chemical com-
positions of the diets and wheat cultivars are shown in
Table 1. One part of each diet was used without en-
zyme addition, the other part was supplemented with
a commercial enzyme mixture (KEMZYME R
� Plus dry,
Kemin Europa NV, Herentals, Belgium) at a dose rate
of 500 g/T of feed. Drinking water and feed (in mash
form) were provided for ad libitum consumption. The
balance trial was carried out according to the EU-
reference method (Bourdillon et al., 1990) and con-
sisted of a 5-d period of adaptation (to the respective
experimental diets containing titanium dioxide, d 13
to 17) and a 5-d main balance period (d 18 to 22).
Before the adaptation and main balance period (d 1
to 13), the chickens were housed together and fed the
same commercial mash starter diet (based on Aviagen,
2009). Feed intake was recorded and all excreta were
collected in a quantitative way using plastic trays un-
der the cages. A homogeneous sample of the mixed wet
excreta was freeze-dried until analysis.
Performance Trial The trial was performed with
960 birds, housed in 32 pens (4 dietary treatments ×
8 replicates, 30 birds/pen). The birds were fed using
a 3-phase feeding scheme with periods of 13 d each:
starter (d 1 to 13), grower (d 14 to 26) and finisher
(d 27 to 39). Drinking water and feed (in mash form)
were provided ad libitum. Two basal diets for each of
the 3-phase feeding periods were formulated using ei-
ther wheat (unknown cultivar) alone or wheat mixed
with rye and barley (83.8% wheat, 13.0% rye, 3.2%
barley, further referred to as wheatmix), to mimic a
wheat high in NSP. Diets were formulated to meet
breeder’s recommendations (Aviagen, 2009) and in-
cluded a coccidiostaticum (0.5 g/kg Salinomycin) and a
phytase (0.2 g/kg Ronozyme NP). The ingredients and
the chemical compositions of the grower diets and the
wheat or wheatmix are shown in Table 1. One part of
each diet was used without enzyme addition, the other
part was supplemented with KEMZYME Plus dry at a
dose rate of 500 g/T of feed.
Collection of Intestinal and Blood Samples
At the end of the balance trial, 2 animals per cage
were randomly selected and euthanized following the
principles for care of animals in experimentation. In-
testinal contents were collected from the ileum (between
Meckel’s diverticulum and the ileocecal junction) of the
2 animals by gently finger-stripping the intestinal seg-
ment. The digesta contents collected from 2 animals per
cage were pooled and stored on ice until analysis.
At the end of the performance trial, blood samples
were taken from one bird per pen. The blood samples
were collected in 5 mL Vacuette R
� tubes containing Hep-
arin (456,083, Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Kremsm¨
unster,
Austria), stored on ice until centrifugation (1,500 × g
for 10 min) to obtain the plasma and then stored at
–21◦C until analysis.

titanium dioxide concentration in the feed was analyzed
as described before (Smeets et al., 2015). Crude protein,
moisture, starch and NSP content and extract viscos-
ity of the wheat were measured as described by Smeets
et al. (2015). The intestinal samples were centrifuged
for 10 min at 10,000× g and the supernatants were ana-
lyzed for ileal viscosity, xylanase inhibition activity, xy-
lanase activity and titanium dioxide concentration. Ileal
viscosity was determined at 40◦C using a Brookfield
cone and plate viscometer. For the estimation of xy-
lanase inhibition activity, the supernatant was diluted
2 times with sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0, 0.025 M)
and the assay was performed as described by Smeets
et al. (2014b). Xylanase activity in the intestinal sam-
ples was evaluated by diluting the supernatant 10 times
(in sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 0.1 M) and adding
a Xylazyme AX tablet (Megazyme International, Bray
Co. Wicklow, Ireland) to 1 mL of diluted digesta sam-
ple. This mixture was then incubated at 50◦C for
2 h. Hereafter, 4 mL ethanol (95% v/v) was added, the
mixture was centrifuged at 1,500 × g, and the absorp-
tion was measured spectrophotometrically at 585 nm.
A portion of the intestinal samples was freeze-dried and
the concentration of titanium dioxide was quantified as
described before.

Total tract digestibility of DM, fat, starch, WE-
NSP, WU-NSP, and TOT-NSP, N retention, and ap-
parent metabolizable energy, corrected for nitrogen
(AMEn), were calculated using the concentrations of

intake, body weight, feed conversion ratio [FCR]) were
calculated for each sub-period (starter, grower and

procedure was used to separate individual treatment
means. The balance trial results were analyzed as a 3
× 2 factorial arrangement of dietary treatments involv-
ing 3 wheats (Viscount, Rustic, and Centenaire) and 2
enzyme dosages (0 and 500 g/T). The performance trial
results were analyzed as a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement
of dietary treatments involving 2 raw material sources
(wheat alone or wheatmix) and 2 enzyme dosages (0
and 500 g/T). All statements of significance were based
on a P-value less than or equal to 0.05.
RESULTS
Wheat Cultivars
The results of the composition analysis for the dif-
ferent wheat samples and wheatmix are shown in
Table 1. Centenaire wheat had the highest concentra-
tion of total NSP (111 g/kg), and Rustic (96.3 g/kg)
and Viscount (91.8 g/kg) had comparable and lower
values. The wheat used in the performance trial was
a standard wheat with a total NSP concentration of
96.1 g/kg DM. This wheat was mixed with rye and
barley to mimic wheat high in NSP. This mixture in-
deed had a high NSP concentration (103.9 g/kg DM),
most pronounced in the WE part of the NSP.
Balance Trial
The average recovery of xylanase (main enzyme ac-
tivity present in the enzyme mixture) from the enzyme-
treated feed for both the balance and performance trial
was 104% (data not shown). The effect of different
wheat cultivars and enzyme addition on total tract di-
gestibilities, AMEn, ileal viscosity, ileal xylanase activ-
ity, and ileal xylanase inhibition activity is shown in
Table 2. No effect of wheat cultivar on nutrient di-
gestibility or AMEn was observed without enzyme ad-
dition. Inclusion of the enzyme mixture significantly re-
duced the ileal viscosity for all diets. In the diets with
the Rustic and Viscount wheat cultivars, this reduction
in ileal viscosity did not result in any improvements
in nutrient digestibility. In the diet with the high NSP
wheat cultivar Centenaire, enzyme addition increased
DM digestibility, nitrogen retention, and AMEn. No

1Reported values are means of 8 replicates, wheat: medium concentration of non-starch polysaccharides, wheatmix: mixture of wheat, rye and
barley to mimic a high concentration of non-starch polysaccharides.

effects of the dietary treatments on WE-NSP digestibil-
ity could be observed. WU-NSP were the most di-
gestible in the Centenaire wheat diet and the least
digestible in the Viscount wheat diet, when averaged
across enzyme levels (P ≤ 0.10). The results shown in
Table 2 show some xylanase activity left in the ileum
of the enzyme-treated feed. By use of the results of the
tracer analyses in the feed and intestinal content, it
could be calculated that on average 12% of the original
xylanase activity in the feed was present in the ileum.
Also, some xylanase inhibition activity was present in
the ileal samples, which was on average 1.3% of the
inhibition activity in the feed.
Performance Trial
The mortality during the performance trial was on
average 3.1% and was not affected by the dietary treat-
ments (P > 0.05; data not shown). The effect of the
2 diet formulations (wheat or wheatmix) and the addi-
tion of an enzyme mixture on daily feed intake, body
weight, and FCR during the starter, grower, finisher,
and the total period is shown in Table 3. During the
starter and grower period, feed intake was higher with
the addition of the enzyme mixture (when averaged
across diets). The body weight was lower after the
grower and finisher period with the wheatmix diet than
with wheat alone. At the end of the grower and fin-
isher periods, enzyme addition only improved the body
weight in the wheatmix diet. The FCR was higher for
the wheatmix diet compared to wheat alone during the
grower period and the whole period. Enzyme addition
improved the FCR in the diet with wheat alone dur-
ing starter and grower period, whereas the FCR was
improved by the enzyme in the wheatmix diet during
each period.
DISCUSSION
A first aim of the animal trials described in this paper
was to examine the effect of the variable NSP concen-
tration and composition of wheat on broiler digestion,
similar to the previous experiment described by Smeets
et al. (2015). Unlike what was expected, based on the
NSP composition of the wheat cultivars, and the higher
ileal viscosity in the Centenaire diet, no differences in
nutrient digestibilities or AMEn were observed between
the diets in the balance trial. Other reports also indicate
no relationship between AMEn and NSP concentration
(Nicol et al., 1993; Austin et al., 1999; Parsaie et al.,
2006), although there are a lot of researchers who do
find a correlation (Dusel et al., 1997; Choct et al., 1999;
Smeets et al., 2015). A possible explanation for this lack
of relationship could be related to the NSP digestibil-
ity, as will be explained further in this discussion. In the
performance trial, differences were observed in perfor-
mance measures between the 2 diets (wheat: medium
NSP—wheatmix: high NSP) without enzyme addition.
These differences were most clear in the grower and
finisher periods. The birds fed the wheatmix diet were
less heavy and had a higher FCR than the birds fed the
wheat diet. These results indicate that the relationship
between AMEn and animal performance is not always
clear, as also observed by other researchers.

 INTERACTIONS BETWEEN WHEAT QUALITY AND ENZYMES
2069
The second aim of the trials described in this pa-
per was to study the relationship between the NSP
composition of wheat and the effect of enzyme ad-
dition. In the balance trial, addition of the enzyme
caused a significant increase in nutrient digestibilities
and AMEn for the high NSP wheat Centenaire, whereas
in the Viscount cultivar no differences were observed.
In the performance trial, inclusion of the enzyme mix-
ture improved the body weight (grower and finisher
period) and FCR (finisher and total period) only for
the wheatmix diet. These observations confirm the hy-
pothesis that the effect of enzyme addition is related to
the NSP concentration of the diet, as observed earlier
(Choct et al., 1995; Dusel et al., 1998; Huyghebaert et
al., 1999) and as also demonstrated in vitro by Smeets
et al. (2014a). The concentration of NSP should there-
fore be considered in the practice of feed formulation.
In addition, the remaining xylanase activity in the
small intestine was measured in the current study. Only
a few other researchers report intestinal enzyme activ-
ities (Silva and Smithard, 2002; Choct, 2006). It was
calculated that on average 12% of the original xylanase
activity was present in the ileum. This corresponds to
the study by Silva and Smithard (2002) who estimated
that between 15 and 20% of the xylanase added to a
rye-based feed was active in the small intestine. In addi-
tion to grain-associated xylanases, wheat also contains
xylanase inhibitors, which are also believed to be still
active in the small intestine (Smeets et al., 2014b). In
the latter study, it was observed that the xylanase in-
hibitors were not affected by the in vitro simulation
of intestinal conditions. In the present study, however,
only 1.3% of the original inhibition activity was present
in the ileum. Nevertheless, the inhibition activity of
wheat is considerable (Smeets et al., 2014b) and it is
therefore conceivable that even a portion, as small as
1.3% could inhibit the exogenous xylanases present.
The digestibility of NSP in the intestinal tract was
low, as observed in previous studies (Dusel et al., 1998;
Meng et al., 2004), although the amount of studies that
report intestinal NSP digestibility is limited. No sig-
nificant differences were observed for NSP digestibility
between the wheat cultivars. It should be noted, how-
ever, that the experimental errors were rather high, as
the analytical measurement of NSP in fecal samples is
difficult. There were some trends observed (P ≤ 0.10).
The NSP from the high NSP wheat Centenaire were
generally more digestible (when the data were aver-
aged across enzyme levels). Choct et al. (2004) also
noticed a higher NSP-digestibility in a low-ME wheat.
They suggested that the NSP of the low-ME wheat were
structurally different from those in the high-ME wheat.
In the current study, only the arabinose/xylose-ratio
gives some estimation of structure, but the latter was
not different between the 3 wheat samples. The ara-
binose/xylose ratio only gives information about the
amount of arabinose side-chains on the xylose back-
bone, but not about the distribution of the arabinose
side-chains. The presence of large fragments of un-
branched xylose residues could lead to the formation
of “junction zones” between different AX molecules
(Izydorczyk and Biliaderis, 1995). It can be expected
that these kinds of AX molecules are not readily sol-
ubilized and not fermented by the microbiota in the
intestines. Furthermore, the presence of other side
chains such as ferulic acids can also affect the water-
extractability and hence possibly the digestibility of the
NSP (Izydorczyk and Biliaderis, 1995). The observation
that the NSP from the Centenaire wheat were more di-
gestible can explain the lack of depression in nutrient
digestibility observed with this wheat.
In conclusion, the study was not able to show a con-
sistent relationship between the NSP concentration of
wheat and its nutritional value, but did demonstrate
that the effect of an enzyme mixture on nutrient di-
gestibility or broiler performance depends upon the
NSP concentration in the diet.
