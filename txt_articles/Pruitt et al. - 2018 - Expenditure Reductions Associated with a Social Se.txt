Abstract
Recent health system innovations provide encouraging evidence that greater coordination of medical and social
services can improve health outcomes and reduce health care expenditures. This study evaluated the savings
associated with a managed care organization’s call center-based social service referral program that aimed to
assist participants address their social needs, such as homelessness, transportation barriers, and food insecurity.
The program evaluation linked social service referral data with health care claims to analyze expenditures in
2 annual periods, before and after the first social service referral. Secondary data analysis estimated the change in
mean expenditures over 2 annual periods using generalized estimating equations regression analysis with the
identity link. The study compared the change in mean health care expenditures for the second year for those
reporting social needs met versus the group whose needs remained unmet. By comparing the difference between
the first and second year mean expenditures for both groups, the study estimated the associated savings of social
services, after controlling for group differences. These results showed that the decrease in second year mean
expenditures for the group of participants who reported all of their social needs met was $2443 (10%) greater than
the decrease in second year mean expenditures for the group who reported none of their social needs met, after
controlling for group differences. Organizations that integrate medical and social services may thrive under policy
initiatives that require financial accountability for the total well-being of patients.

Introduction
P
opulation health suffers when weak ties isolate
medical care from social services.1–3 The United States
trails similar countries in the integration of medical care de-
livery and social services, such as food, transportation, and
housing assistance.4,5 Vulnerable patients, including older
adults and people with low incomes or chronic illnesses, often
face urgent nonmedical needs that impact medical care utili-
zation.6–9 Recent health system innovations in the United
Statesdemonstrate that greater attentionto socialdeterminants
of health can improve health outcomes and reduce health care
expenditures.10–13 However, more research is necessary to
evaluate the association of medical system coordination of
social services with health care expenditures.11,14,15
HealthConnections represents a new model of medical
and social service coordination.16,17 The program was de-
veloped by WellCare Health Plans, Inc., a managed care
organization (MCO). Since September 2014, participants
with unmet social needs have contacted the call center-
based program to obtain free referrals to a nationwide net-
work of local, community-based public assistance programs.
The program matches participant needs to available social
services.17 Similar to 2-1-1 social service information phone
lines, the MCO call center representatives refer participants
to many different types of social services, including trans-
portation, food programs, financial assistance for utilities,
education programs, and housing services.18,19
The HealthConnections program representatives offer 2
additional services beyond the typical 2-1-1 service offerings.

 First, because of limited resources of 2-1-1 systems, com-
munity organizations must add and maintain their information
in the various 2-1-1 system online databases.20 HealthCon-
nections employs a team of individuals responsible for iden-
tifying, collecting, maintaining, and analyzing the database of
community-based social service organizations. Also, the call
center is staffed with representatives who have personal ex-
periences with the social service system, an approach that
enables identification of the best match of services for par-
ticipants’ unmet social needs.16 Program representatives may
make referrals to social service organizations for multiple
social needs, such as help with utility payments or transpor-
tation to the doctor. The program tracks each referral in the
tracking database separately. Program representatives follow
up with the participants to confirm whether the social services
met their social needs.
Methods
Study design
This retrospective, secondary data analysis examined
the association between met social needs and health care
expenditures. The study compared the change in mean
health care expenditures for 2 groups of participants – all
social needs met versus no social needs met – in the year
before the social service referral and year after social service
referral.
Study population
The study sample included participants insured through
Medicare Advantage or Medicaid managed care in 14 states
who called WellCare’s HealthConnections program be-
tween January 1, 2015, and March 1, 2016 seeking referrals
to a broad array of community-based public assistance
programs, such as housing services and utility assistance.
Participants learned of the referral program through health
plan materials (eg, provider directories), advertisements,
health care service providers, and the MCO customer ser-
vice and case management units.16 The MCO program’s
database contained hundreds of organizations offering more
than 60 categories of social services. All study participants
identified at least 1 type of unmet social need and received
at least 1 referral to a social service organization. Program
representatives provided contact information of the organi-
zation to participants, who then were responsible for con-
tacting and utilizing the referred service.
Program representatives followed up with all participants,
usually within 2 weeks of the referral, to track whether the
participant reported each of their identified social needs as
met or not met. For example, if a participant received 3
referrals—1 food bank, 1 utility assistance, and 1 transpor-
tation service—and subsequently reported that they had
each of the 3 identified social service needs met, then that
participant had ‘‘all of their needs met.’’ The group of
participants who reported that they had all of their identified
needs met were compared to those who reported that none of
their identified needs were met.
Participants who reported that only some of the referred
services met their identified social needs were excluded in
the primary analysis, but included in the sensitivity analysis.
Participants were excluded from all analyses if the use of the
social service could not be confirmed, if they had incom-
plete sociodemographic data, or if they were not enrolled
continuously with the MCO throughout the 2-year study
period.
Outcome measures
Social service referral tracking data were connected to
MCO medical claims for each participant with records be-
tween January 1, 2014, and March 1, 2017. The outcome
measures were the change in mean health care expenditures
from the 12 months before the index referral to 12 months
after. The index dates demarcating each 12-month period
were defined as the earliest referral date when the social
needs were met or the earliest referral date when the social
needs were not met.
Mean total health care expenditures for all participants
were calculated by summing the fee-for-service expendi-
tures paid by the MCO in unadjusted US dollars 12 months
before and after the referral index date. Expenditures were
grouped by health service type, including professional
(office-based physician, emergency department [ED]-based
physician, and laboratory), inpatient, outpatient (hospital-
based, skilled nursing facility, ambulatory surgery center,
and urgent care clinic), ED (facility only), and prescription
drugs.
Study variables
Following Andersen’s Behavioral Model of health ser-
vices utilization, the study’s statistical models controlled for
predisposing, need, and enabling factors.21 Predisposing
characteristics included state of residence (Arkansas, Con-
necticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Missouri, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, South Car-
olina, Tennessee, and Texas), metropolitan status (rural as
<250,000 residents or urban as >250,000 residents),22 race/
ethnicity (black, white, Hispanic, or Native American/
Asian/other), age, and sex. To account for illnesses that
directly generate the need for health services, a categori-
zation of the count of comorbid diagnoses (none, 1–3, and
>3) was included.23,24 Enabling variables included partici-
pant insurance type (Medicaid managed care or Medicare
Advantage) and whether they were actively enrolled in case
management during the study period.
Statistical analyses
Pre-referral characteristics of the study groups are described
using means and proportions. The differences in proportions
among study groups were tested using a chi-square test and
mean differences in age were tested using the 2 independent
sample t test. The frequency distribution of social service
needs met also was examined.
Mean differences in health care expenditures over the 2
annual periods within and between the 2 study groups were
estimated. Typical of expenditure measures, the distribution
of the means was skewed to the right. Measurement of the
mean differences was utilized to determine the relationship of
the referral program to total health care costs.25,26 To deter-
mine the relative change in expenditures over time, general-
ized estimating equations (GEE) with the identity link were
utilized to account for skewness, heteroscedasticity, and
470

 within-subject effects over time periods. Components of the
GEE model included indicators to represent the study groups,
time period, an interaction of the group reporting all needs
met with time-period, and predisposing, need, and enabling
factors, as already described. The coefficient of the interac-
tion term represented the impact of social services on the
mean change in expenditures between study groups. The in-
dex date in the model was utilized to neutralize any influence
the average index date among groups could have on the study
results.
Additional analysis
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to define the study
groups in a different manner. The group who reported at
least 1 social need met was compared to the group of par-
ticipants who reported none of their social needs met. Al-
though the primary analysis enabled evaluation of the
program under ideal conditions, the inclusion of participants
with partially met needs provides some practical informa-
tion on the marginal influence of the program.
In addition, analyses of 2 subgroups of the study partic-
ipants were conducted, including participants identified by
the MCO as high risk through a variety of a health risk
appraisal (HRA) screening questionnaires. The MCO’s
HRA algorithms considered individual factors, such as poor
functional or nutritional status, to predict future heath care
utilization.27 The subgroups defined by different insurance
types also were examined separately.
All tests were 2-sided and analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). The study
was classified as exempt by the University of South Florida

 Institutional Review Board (#Pro00028372) as the program
evaluation is based on analysis of data collected previously
for existing program operations. In addition, informed
consent for the secondary data analysis was not required as
all data were de-identified by removing any personally
identifiable information.
Results
Among the 2718 participants in the analysis, 1521 (56%)
reported all of their identified social needs were met and
1197 (44%) reported that none of their needs were met.
Among the 5035 social services received in the second year,
the 10 most commonly reported social services, which re-
presented 78.7% of all services, were medical transportation
support (14.5%), utility financial assistance (12.1%), food
pantry or program (11.8%), free or reduced vision services
(9.9%), general financial assistance (7.9%), free or reduced
dental services (6.1%), medication assistance (5.7%), gen-
eral transportation support (4.2%), housing support (3.8%),
and rent assistance (2.7%).
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of participant
characteristics by study group. There were statistically sig-
nificant differences across primary analysis study groups for
all covariates except for sex and race/ethnicity.
As shown in Table 2, the group reporting all of their
needs met had higher predicted total expenditures than the
group of participants who reported not having any of their
social needs met in both the first and second years. Ex-
penditures for the group reporting all their needs met in the
first year and second years is consistently higher for each of
the service types, such as inpatient and ED.
Participants who reported all their social needs were met
experienced an 11% reduction in total health care expen-
ditures in the 12 month post-referral period. The predicted
reduction for this group was estimated to be $2601
(SE = $735; P < 0.001) in the second year, after controlling
for group differences (Table 2). Conversely, among those
who reported that their needs were not met, a small and
nonsignificant reduction in the second year was observed
(P = 0.86) (Table 2). When examining the pre–post mean
difference between the 2 study groups, the analysis revealed
that the group reporting all of their needs met had a greater
reduction in mean expenditures in the year following the
referral. This reduction in total expenditures represents a
comparative 10% reduction (P = 0.04) in the second year,
after controlling for group differences (Table 2).
Table 2 also itemizes the results by service type. For
inpatient services, a 10% reduction in expenditures between
study groups was observed in the second year, although of
limited significance (P = 0.15), compared to participants
who reported not having any of their social needs met. For
outpatient services, the relative reduction in expenditures
between participant groups was 16% (P = <0.04). The sec-
ond year point estimates for professional services were
small and nonsignificant, and the prescription drug and ED
estimated expenditures increased in the second year for both
groups.
The subgroup analysis revealed relative differences in
expenditures in the 12 months before and after the index

tions (Table 3). The relative difference for participants insured
by Medicare Advantage was 3.3% (b = $589; SE= $1473;
P = <0.67) and the relative difference for participants insured
by Medicaid managed care was -1.4% (P = <0.14). Among
high-risk participants, the relative difference between groups
in the second year was -8.6% (P = 0.10). Among those par-
ticipants not identified as high risk, the relative difference in
expenditures was -5.0% (P = 0.72) (Table 3).
The sensitivity analysis shown in Table 4 illustrates the
comparison of the mean expenditures for participants with at
least 1 met social need compared to those whose social needs
were not met. Participants with at least 1 social need met ex-
perienced a relative 7% reduction in total health care costs
compared to the control group (b = -$1,572, SE= $1137;
P = 0.17).
Discussion
This program evaluation investigated an MCO’s effort to
address diverse social needs through integration of medical
care and social support. The results showed that participants
who reported all their social needs met had higher health
care costs than those who reported none of their needs met
in the pre-referral year; these costs remained higher even in
the post-referral year after all of their social needs were met.
Although addressing social needs may not have reduced the
costs to the level of those with unmet social needs, the larger
decrease in costs represents a significant finding for orga-
nizations that accept financial risk for the care of popula-
tions of patients. These results reinforce the need for
policies that encourage organizations to accept financial
responsibility for addressing social determinants of health
through nonmedical interventions.28–30
In the primary analysis, the mean health care expenditure
for each group decreased in the 12 months after the social
service referral index date. The reductions in expenditures
likely are related to unknown effects outside fulfilling the
social service need among these participants. This phe-
nomenon makes the application of the comparison group in
this analysis essential. Therefore, this study reports the dif-
ference in the change in mean second year expenditures
between study groups. Although there is a reduction in mean
expenses for both groups in the second year, an additional
10% reduction exists for those who reported their social
needs met, compared to those who did not. This relative
$2443 reduction in the second year may be related to ad-
dressing their social needs.

COST SAVINGS OF MEETING SOCIAL NEEDS
473
 Effective health care delivery may require interventions
from a broad array of community-based organizations
that act beyond the scope of the medical care provider.31
These findings are consistent with a growing body of lit-
erature showing that programs that coordinate multiple
types of social services may reduce health care expendi-
tures or utilization.11,12,19,32,33 Although some programs
have targeted specific social determinants of health, such
as food insecurity6,9,34–36 or housing needs,7,37,38 almost
half of studies examined in a recent systematic literature
review included interventions designed to address multi-
ple unmet social needs.15 The wide variation of service
types represented in HealthConnections referral data is
consistent with this multi-sector approach.
In addition, these analyses aimed to evaluate the social
service referral program as a whole; therefore, the key
variable of interest was self-identified social service needs.
HealthConnections referred participants to services with a
variety of social service intensity (eg, food bank vs. home-
less shelter). Rather than measuring the different types or
counts of individual social services, which would wrongly
assume that the various services are comparable, this study
categorized participants according to whether they reported
that services addressed self-identified need. Future analysis
seeking to evaluate the relationship of each service type to
health care expenditures may be warranted.
These primary results indicate that meeting social needs
may lower total health care expenditures through a reduction
in a variety of medical care service types. Inpatient cost
reductions show the largest point estimate reduction be-
tween study groups, although of limited statistical signifi-
cance. For outpatient services, which include claims for
hospital-based outpatient services, skilled nursing facilities,
ambulatory surgery centers, and urgent care clinics, there
were moderate and significant differences among groups.
Future investigation should analyze the impact of medical
and social care integration on specific medical care service
types.
The relative savings of addressing social needs supports
the HealthConnections program design, whereby anyone
can contact the call center for a referral, negating the need to
proactively stratify patients by risk levels. However, the
subgroup analysis reveals the potential utility of targeting
high-risk patient populations for social service interventions,
as shown in previous research.32,38 These findings show a
noteworthy $3134 (8.6%) relative reduction between study
groups point estimates in the second year, although of
limited significance (P = 0.10). Proactive identification of
high-risk patients with potential unmet social needs through
health assessments and predictive algorithms, as seen in
other social service coordination programs,11,39 may be
worthwhile to organizations seeking to reduce costs by ad-
dressing social needs.
In the sensitivity analysis, participants with at least 1
social need met were compared to those whose needs were
not met. This analysis revealed that although there was a 7%
relative reduction in expenditures in the 12 months after the
index referral date between groups, the result was not sig-
nificant. It is possible that participants with at least some
unmet needs may experience exacerbations of current health
conditions because of unmet social needs, despite getting
other social needs met.
Limitations
Several caveats apply to these findings. First, the findings
relate to a sample of participants who self-identified their
social service needs and were motivated to call the referral
hotline. In addition, subjects were categorized into groups
using self-reports about whether or not their social needs
were met. The participants who reported all of their social
needs met may have been more diligent about managing
their health care expenses as well as following up on their
social services referrals. Although the degree to which this
motivation to address social needs or report social needs met
impacted expenditures is unknown, caution should be taken
in generalizing these results to a general managed care
population. Future research could evaluate the impact of
addressing social determinants of health on medical ex-
penditures through an experimental design in which par-
ticipants are randomly assigned to either the usual social
service referral program or to an enhanced social service
navigation aimed at assuring and independently confirming
access to social services.
Although MCO staff followed up with all participants to
track whether or not the social service met their needs, a
noteworthy number of program participants (n = 18,454)
had not been contacted and, therefore, were excluded from
these analyses. Participants were not contacted for a vari-
ety of reasons, including inability to reach them and those
referred too soon to qualify for follow-up. It is not known
whether these participants were more likely to report their
social needs met or to utilize additional health care ser-
vices. Despite this limitation, the sample size of each of the
study groups was large enough for valid analysis. Im-
proved patient engagement and follow-up would improve
future program evaluation but incur additional program
costs.40
It is unclear why the group who reported their needs were
unmet had lower health care costs in the year before and
after the social service referral. Although the models ad-
justed for disease severity and other observable factors, they
did not account for potentially relevant unobserved covari-
ates, such as education attainment, attitudes, social support,
income level, support from other community programs, or
functional disability, that may impact both medical and
social service utilization. It is possible that unmeasured
barriers negatively affect both health service and social
service utilization. Alternatively, it may be that the group
who reported all their social needs met has an unmeasured
need for more health care that leads them to be more likely
to obtain social services.
The social service tracking database did not record the
reasons why participants report that their needs were not
met. It is possible that certain participants were more likely
to perceive social services negatively, or to perceive that the
service was not of sufficient quality, or did not access the
service at all. Furthermore, social service organizations
outside the program may have served participants’ social
needs, a circumstance that would reduce the measured effect
of the HealthConnections program. The lack of more de-
tailed tracking data may introduce potential selection bias
issues. It is unclear how these may influence the direction
of this observed effect or whether they effect the groups
equally.

 Lastly, collecting reliable data on the cost of social ser-
vices from the community-based organizations, such as food
pantries and homeless shelters, creates challenges to eval-
uating how social service needs affects total medical care
expenditures. As such, it is not known whether savings re-
alized by the MCO represents savings to the entire system.
For organizations to fully incorporate social services into
their health care delivery or insurance benefit structures, it
may be necessary to validly and reliably define the social
services and associated costs. Unfortunately, no compre-
hensive coding system exists that would enable providers to
specify the social services delivered. A small number of
billing codes (eg, home-delivered meals [S5170]) are in-
cluded in the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding Sys-
tem developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services.41 However, a more complete social services bill-
ing code set would permit more precise measurement,
payment, and evaluation of social service care.42,43
Conclusions
The objective of this study was to evaluate an MCO’s call
center-based social services coordination program to un-
derstand the relationship of social services to health care
expenditures. This study found that by connecting partici-
pants with needed social services, the MCO significantly
reduced health care expenditures. The MCO conceived
HealthConnections in recognition of the Institute of Medi-
cine’s call to improve coordination of the social and medical
care systems by promoting community-based partnerships.44
These multi-sector collaborative partnerships hold promise
for improving population health.1 Yet, financial incentives
contribute only part of the potential benefits to social and
medical care integration. Future research should examine
how investments in social service interventions can improve
community health outcomes.
