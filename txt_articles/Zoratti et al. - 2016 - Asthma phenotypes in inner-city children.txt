Abstract
Background—Children with asthma in low-income urban areas have high morbidity. Phenotypic 
analysis in these children is lacking, but may identify characteristics to inform successful tailored 
management approaches.
Objective—To identify distinct asthma phenotypes among inner-city children receiving 
guidelines-based management.
Methods—Nine Inner City Asthma Consortium centers enrolled 717 children ages 6-17 years. 
Data were collected at baseline and prospectively every 2 months for 1 year. Participants’ asthma 
and rhinitis were optimally managed by study physicians based on guidelines. Cluster analysis

 using 50 baseline and 12 longitudinal variables was performed in 616 participants completing ≥4 
follow-up visits.
Results—Five clusters (designated A through E) were distinguished by indicators of asthma and 
rhinitis severity, pulmonary physiology, allergy (sensitization and total serum IgE) and allergic 
inflammation. In comparison to other clusters, Cluster A was distinguished by lower allergy/
inflammation, minimally symptomatic asthma and rhinitis and normal pulmonary physiology. 
Cluster B had highly symptomatic asthma despite high step-level treatment, lower allergy and 
inflammation, and mildly altered pulmonary physiology. Cluster C had minimally symptomatic 
asthma and rhinitis, intermediate allergy and inflammation and mildly impaired pulmonary 
physiology. Clusters D and E exhibited progressively higher asthma and rhinitis symptoms and 
allergy/inflammation. Cluster E had the most symptomatic asthma while receiving high step-level 
treatment and had the highest total serum IgE (median 733 kU/L), blood eosinophil count (median 
400 cells/mm3) and allergen sensitizations (15 of 22 tested).
Conclusions—Allergy distinguishes asthma phenotypes in urban children. Severe asthma often 
co-clusters with highly allergic children. However, a symptomatic phenotype with little allergy or 
allergic inflammation was identified.

INTRODUCTION
Hallmarks of asthma include varying degrees of episodic dyspnea, wheezing or coughing, in 
association with airway obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and airway 
inflammation. Considering the heterogeneity of features, severity, and therapeutic responses 
inherent in asthma, characterizing discrete phenotypes is essential to improving and 
personalizing asthma care. Unsupervised cluster analysis, a statistical method commonly 
applied in clinical studies to group participants with similar characteristics, has been used to

 identify discrete asthma phenotypes in several cohorts of varying ages, demographics and 
underlying asthma severity.1-8
Children living in low-income urban regions of the United States have high morbidity and 
asthma severity.9 Little is known about the asthma phenotypes in these at-risk children and 
whether there are phenotypes that are less likely to respond to specific interventions, 
including standard guidelines-based therapy. To meet this need, we designed and conducted 
the NIH/NIAID sponsored Inner-City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) Asthma Phenotypes in 
the Inner City (APIC) study. In this report, we present our findings from an unsupervised 
cluster analysis.
METHODS
Study Population
The APIC study was designed as a prospective, epidemiological investigation of 6-17 year-
old asthmatic children from low-income areas of 9 U.S. cities (Baltimore MD, Boston MA, 
Chicago IL, Cincinnati OH, Dallas TX, Denver CO, Detroit MI, New York NY, Washington 
DC). The protocol was approved by institutional review boards from each center, and written 
informed consent was obtained from the legal guardians of participating children. Assent 
was obtained from 561 children according to IRB requirements. Between August 2011 and 
September 2013, 845 children were screened, 795 met eligibility criteria, and 717 completed 
the study entry visit (V0). These children were scheduled for bimonthly visits for one year 
(V1-V6) and received guidelines-based management of their asthma and rhinitis as well as 
additional evaluations. Completion of 4 or more post-enrollment visits was required for 
inclusion in this cluster analysis. For asthma, a predefined, computerized NAEPP Expert 
Panel Report-3 based treatment algorithm was used by the study clinicians to adjust the 
participant's controller regimen at each visit based on asthma symptoms, spirometry results, 
and recent exacerbations.10 For rhinitis, medications were prescribed in accordance with the 
Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma recommendations.11 The frequency and degree 
of bothering of nasal symptoms were captured and an algorithm was used to adjust 
treatment. Detailed descriptions of asthma and rhinitis management algorithms, data 
collection and scoring systems for the APIC study are included in Pongracic et al.12
Study Assessments
Each participant was characterized using a set of 50 baseline variables measured at 
Screening or V0 as well as the within-participant mean and variance of 6 asthma severity 
variables measured at every visit between V0 to V6 (12 variables). These variables were 
selected for inclusion based on a review of previous asthma cluster analyses in the literature 
and a consensus among APIC investigators.
A complete list of the variables entered into the hierarchical cluster algorithm (HCA) is 
provided in Table E1 of the Online Repository. The variables were representative of several 
domains that were designated solely for descriptive purposes: demographics, family history, 
allergy history, asthma history, environmental exposures, body mass index (BMI), serum

 Vitamin D level, stress, allergen sensitization, allergic inflammation, pulmonary physiology, 
asthma severity, and rhinitis.
Statistical Methods
Variable Reduction—Variables representing specific allergen sensitization through skin 
prick test or specific IgE were grouped together using an HCA based on Pearson 
correlations.13 Using the result of the cluster analysis as a guide, allergens were grouped into 
the following 7 categories: molds, dust mites, cockroaches, rodents, pets, pollen/peanut, and 
foods. Instead of using separate variables for each individual allergen, separate variables 
representing sensitization in each of the 7 categories were created and used as variables in 
the clustering algorithm.
Hierarchical Clustering Analysis—R version 3.2.2 was used for the analyses. Prior to 
analysis, any missing data at Screening or V0 were imputed using a single imputation based 
on a fully conditional specification approach. Unless otherwise noted, all results were based 
on imputed data. To identify clusters of participants that were similar to each other based on 
the variables of interest, an agglomerative HCA was used. This algorithm works by 
measuring similarity between two participants, or two groups of participants, using a 
distance metric such that the distance between two participants who are alike is small while 
the distance between two participants who are dissimilar is large. In this case, distance 
between any two participants was calculated using a tree-based clustering algorithm that 
addresses multi-collinearity among variables14 while distance between any two clusters was 
calculated using a Ward's minimum-variance linkage clustering approach.15 This algorithm 
was selected because it has been shown to have better performance than many commonly 
used algorithms for HCA in datasets that contain a large number of continuous and 
categorical variables that contain outliers, have skewed distribution or are known to be 
highly collinear.16
Comparisons Among Clusters—To compare characteristics among clusters, analysis of 
variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for continuous variables (normally distributed 
and non-normal, respectively), while chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used for 
categorical variables. No adjustment was made to account for multiple comparisons arising 
from comparisons between clusters or multiple variables. Bar charts and notched box-plots 
were also used to display characteristics of interest between clusters.
Characteristics Relevant to Distinguishing Clusters—The Boruta17 feature 
selection algorithm was used to identify the most relevant characteristics of cluster 
assignment. Boruta tests each variable's z-score obtained from the random forest (a measure 
of loss in accuracy when a randomly permuted copy of the variable is used) to classify each 
variable as confirmed, tentative or rejected with regard to its relevance in distinguishing 
cluster assignment. In this case, an adjustment was made to account for multiple 
comparisons.

 RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Of 717 participants, 98 did not complete at least 4 post-study entry evaluation visits and 3 
participants were missing post-entry spirometry, resulting in 616 (86%) participants included 
in the cluster analysis. The mean age at Screening of this cohort was 10.8 years, 58.3% were 
male, and 63.9% were self-identified as non-Hispanic Black.
Cluster Analysis
The results of the HCA are demonstrated using a dendrogram in Figure 1. Five clusters were 
identified and arbitrarily designated by the letters A through E. Clusters contained between 
92 and 187 participants.
Predictors of Cluster Assignment
Using the Boruta feature selection algorithm, 33 variables were confirmed to be relevant in 
distinguishing the 5 clusters. Figure 2 ranks these variables using the median z-score, a 
measure of variable importance. To produce an overview of the 5 clusters, the confirmed 
variables were categorized into groups reflective of asthma severity, rhinitis severity, 
pulmonary physiology, allergen sensitization (production of allergen-specific and total 
serum IgE) and allergic inflammation (blood eosinophilia and FeNO). A descriptive 
summary, overlaid with a graded color scheme representing quintiles of the data, was created 
to indicate the relative degree to which key variables of importance were present across the 
clusters (Figure 3). Table I provides a comprehensive description of the distribution of each 
variable entered into the cluster algorithm, as well as of other variables of interest, across the 
5 clusters.
Bar graphs depicting the distributions of major characteristics in each cluster are provided in 
the following figures: Figure 4 - Allergy-related variables; Figure 5 - Variables related to 
pulmonary physiology and allergic inflammation; Figure 6 - Longitudinal summaries of 
asthma symptoms, medications, and exacerbations; and Figure 7 - Rhinitis-related variables 
at Screening.
Cluster A
Cluster A included 92 children (14.9% of the cohort). Distinguishing features were 
minimally symptomatic asthma and rhinitis, normal pulmonary physiology, and 
comparatively the lowest levels of allergy and allergic inflammation. During the 12-month 
follow-up, participants received a mean within-subject asthma treatment step-level of 1.39 
and few (13%) required prednisone for asthma exacerbations (Figure 3). A comparatively 
low proportion of participants had self-reported food allergy (17.4%) and eczema (38.0%). 
On average, allergic sensitization was present in only 1 out of the 22 allergens tested, with a 
relatively low proportion (28.3%) having a positive Phadiatop allergen sensitization screen. 
Geometric mean total serum IgE was 39.4 kU/L. This cluster also had comparatively low 
indicators of allergic inflammation, including a median blood eosinophil count of 121 
cells/mm3 and a geometric mean FeNO of 14.1 ppb (Table I and Figures 4-7).

 Cluster B
Cluster B included 93 children (15.1% of the cohort). Distinguishing features included 
comparatively lower levels of allergy and allergic inflammation (similar to Cluster A), but 
highly symptomatic asthma despite a higher treatment step-level with an intermediate degree 
of rhinitis symptoms and treatment requirements (Figure 3). Participants also exhibited 
mildly impaired pulmonary physiology with a mean FEV1/FVC (x100) of 79% over 12 
months and median PC20 of 13.3 mg/ml. Cluster B had the second highest asthma treatment 
step-level (mean: 4.2) and 47.3% of the participants required prednisone for asthma 
exacerbations during the year. A relatively low proportion of participants had self-reported 
food allergy (16.8%) and eczema (38.7%), and allergic sensitization was present in 2 out of 
the 22 allergens tested. The geometric mean total serum IgE was 71.4 kU/L, and 45% of 
participants in this cluster had a positive Phadiatop allergen sensitization screen. This cluster 
had comparatively low indicators of allergic inflammation, including a median blood 
eosinophil count of 200 cells/mm3 and a geometric mean FeNO of 14.6 ppb. (Table I and 
Figures 4-7).
Cluster C
Cluster C included 147 children (23.9% of the population). Distinguishing features included 
minimally symptomatic asthma and rhinitis, low asthma medication treatment step-level and 
minimally impaired pulmonary physiology. Participants had an intermediate degree of 
allergy and allergic inflammation (Figure 3). Detailed results include a comparatively low 
mean asthma treatment step-level (1.93) and a low proportion of exacerbations requiring 
prednisone over the 12-month follow-up (20%). Mean FEV1/FVC (x100) over 12-months 
was 81% and median PC20 was 8.33 mg/ml. Participants exhibited an intermediate degree of 
allergic sensitization (an average of 8.8 out of 22 allergens), a geometric mean total serum 
IgE of 239.0 kU/L and a high proportion had a positive Phadiatop screen (93%). 
Inflammatory markers were intermediate compared to other clusters, with a geometric mean 
FeNO of 20.4 ppb and median blood eosinophil count of 300 cells/mm3. Similar to Cluster 
A, they had a relatively high proportion of participants without rhinitis (18.4%) at screening 
although this decreased to 10.9% between V0-V6 (Table I, Table E2 in the Online 
Repository, and Figures 4-7).
Cluster D
Cluster D included 187 children (30.4% of the cohort) with relatively low symptom levels of 
asthma (similar to Clusters A and C), but requiring an intermediate step-level of controller 
therapy. Cluster D had ubiquitous, symptomatic rhinitis with comparatively higher levels of 
allergy and allergic inflammation and an intermediate degree of pulmonary physiology 
impairment (Figure 3). They required an intermediate asthma treatment step-level (3.4) with 
36% experiencing exacerbations over the year. Mean FEV1/FVC (x100) was 78% over the 
12-month followup and median PC20 was 4.9 mg/ml. Participants reported a high degree of 
food allergy and eczema (41% and 60%, respectively), were sensitized to 13 out of 22 
allergens, had a geometric mean total serum IgE of 576 kU/L and nearly all had a positive 
Phadiatop screen (98%). Compared to Clusters A-C, Cluster D had a higher degree of 
allergic inflammation (geometric mean FeNO of 26.4 ppb and median eosinophil count of

 331 cells/mm3). Cluster D had the most participants with allergic rhinitis (93.6% at baseline 
and 100% during follow-up) and experienced an intermediate level of rhinitis symptoms 
despite requiring the highest levels, along with Cluster E, of rhinitis medication (Table I, 
Table E2 in the Online Repository, and Figures 4-7).
Cluster E
Cluster E included 97 children (15.7% of the cohort) distinguished by the highest levels of 
symptomatic asthma and rhinitis despite receiving the highest levels of asthma and rhinitis 
treatment. They also had the most impaired pulmonary physiology and highest degree of 
allergy and allergic inflammation (Figure 3). The average asthma treatment step-level was 
4.7 with the highest proportion of participants (75%) requiring prednisone for exacerbations. 
Day and nighttime asthma symptoms were comparatively highest at screening and during 
the study. Mean FEV1/FVC (x100) over 12-months was 75% and median PC20 was 3.12 
mg/ml. Participants also had the highest proportions with reported food allergy (42%), 
eczema (75%) and anaphylaxis (12%). They were sensitized to a median of 14 of 22 
allergens, had a median total serum IgE of 616 kU/L, and all had a positive Phadiatop 
screen. Similar to Cluster D, they had higher levels of allergic inflammation with geometric 
mean FeNO of 27.1 ppb and median blood eosinophil count of 400 cells/mm3. At Screening 
and during the follow-up period, rhinitis was present in 96% (Table I, E2 in the Online 
Repository, and Figures 4-7).
DISCUSSION
Several cluster analyses have been reported in asthmatic children,3-5,8 but none restricted to 
low-income, urban populations. Inner-city children may exhibit unique features of asthma 
and phenotypic characterization could be informative of differential responses to asthma 
management strategies as previously reported in other school age children4,18 and 
adolescents.8
Our study's strengths include careful characterization of a large number of school age 
children representing a low income population from urban census tracts but inclusive of the 
full spectrum of asthma. The inclusion of variables measuring longitudinally measured 
outcomes while receiving standardized, guidelines-based asthma and rhinitis management 
over a full year is another aspect of our study that addresses limitations of several other 
HCA.1,19 Another strength of this work is the use of a tree-based clustering algorithm, 
which has major advantages over standard clustering algorithms that use Euclidean distance 
metrics. In particular, this method adapts well to the inclusion of both continuous and 
categorical variables in the clustering algorithm, is resistant to outliers, is unaffected by 
linear scaling, and lessens the effect of collinearity among variables.14,16
We identified five asthma clusters with characteristics ranging from minimally symptomatic 
asthma and normal lung physiology with very low levels of allergy and allergic 
inflammation to highly symptomatic asthma characterized by substantial lung dysfunction, 
frequent exacerbations despite high-level asthma treatment and high levels of allergy and 
inflammation along with the ubiquitous presence of highly symptomatic, difficult to manage 
allergic rhinitis. For 4 of the 5 clusters, we observed striking parallel relationships between

 allergic sensitization, and indicators of asthma and rhinitis severity. However, we also 
identified a previously unreported cluster with comparatively low allergy and only slightly 
impaired pulmonary physiology that remained highly symptomatic on high levels of asthma 
controller therapy over the study's prospective observation year (Cluster B).
Clusters C, D and E were distinguished by progressively higher degrees of allergy, eczema, 
food allergy, allergic inflammation, BHR and allergic rhinitis. We believe these clusters 
represent classic Th2-driven allergic asthma. Although BHR and asthma severity correlate 
with total serum IgE20-22 and allergen sensitization,23-25 the strength of the association 
between Th2-driven pathways and asthma severity varies among different populations and 
may be less prominent in adults.6,26,27
Cluster E was distinguished by treatment-unresponsive asthma with the most impaired lung 
function and the highest levels of day and night symptoms and exacerbations, despite the 
highest asthma controller step treatment. We consider Cluster E to comprise likely 
candidates for emerging biological treatments targeting Th2 pathways in refractory allergic 
asthmatics.
Clusters A and B exhibited relatively lower levels of allergen sensitization, total serum IgE 
and minimal allergic inflammation. However, in contrast to Cluster A, Cluster B had highly 
symptomatic asthma even while receiving higher levels of controller therapy than the other 
clusters (except for the severe allergic asthmatics comprising Cluster E). We speculate these 
children may reflect a discrete phenotype of asthma whose symptoms are out of proportion 
to their degree of readily measurable pulmonary impairment and airway inflammation. 
Alternatively, these children may have uncontrolled or unrecognized comorbidities such as 
GERD and rhinosinusitis triggering symptoms or perhaps even be afflicted by asthma 
masqueraders such as vocal cord dysfunction. Cluster B had the highest percentage of homes 
with a resident smoker. Although only marginally higher compared to several other clusters, 
we speculate that ETS-triggered symptoms, such as cough and wheeze, may have 
contributed to this cluster's highly-symptomatic profile. Additional diagnostic testing and 
possibly deviation from the progressive application of standard guidelines-based step 
therapy may need to be considered for these children.
Cluster C was intermediate for allergy or inflammatory biomarkers and had little evidence of 
impaired pulmonary physiology. Asthma symptoms and medication requirements were 
minimal and similar to Cluster A. Even though allergen sensitization was present, Cluster C 
had also had a low degree of rhinitis symptoms and medication scores. Rhinitis is 
recognized as a potentially important contributor to asthma severity,28 with the lower airway 
affected by pathophysiologic pathways responsible for rhinitis in a manner consistent with 
the “united airway disease” hypothesis.29 We speculate that Cluster C represents a group 
where allergen sensitization may be partially uncoupled from the clinical manifestations of 
allergy, as has been well-described for some patients with food and inhalant sensitization.30 
Alternatively, compared to clusters D and E, this phenotype had relatively lower levels of 
allergy and may manifest asthma and rhinitis symptoms that are readily controlled with low-
intensity therapy.

 Several HCAs have been reported among children in an age range that approximates our 
participants.3-5 The results from these reports are somewhat variable regarding the strength 
of the association between allergy and apparent asthma severity, as determined by the degree 
of symptoms, exacerbations and pulmonary physiology impairment and medication 
requirements. Discrepancies between these studies can be attributed to differences in study 
inclusion criteria and the variables selected, which greatly influence clustering patterns. 
However, some phenotypic characteristics of the reported populations can be compared with 
clusters identified in the APIC population.
Our results are most similar to an HCA of 1041 children ages 5-12 who enrolled in the 
Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP).4 These children were recruited for a 
clinical trial, and an important difference from our population is that enrollees were required 
to have persistent symptoms and BHR, but were limited to having mild- to- moderate 
disease severity. Similar to our results, five clusters were distinguished based on the degree 
of allergy, lung function and asthma burden (primarily exacerbation frequency). Similar to 
the APIC Clusters A and E, CAMP Clusters 1 and 5 exhibited the least and highest degree of 
allergy (sensitization and total serum IgE) respectively, with corresponding low and high 
risk of asthma exacerbation. In contrast to our study, a highly symptomatic, high medication 
requirement cluster with lower levels of allergy, inflammation and BHR (similar to our 
cluster B) was not identified. Each cluster in the CAMP cohort had substantial BHR (PC20 
in the range of 4 mg/ml or lower). It is likely that children similar to those in APIC Cluster B 
were excluded from the CAMP cohort due to exclusion of children that lacked evidence of 
BHR and lung dysfunction at screening. Furthermore, in contrast to the CAMP population, 
APIC participants were managed using a step-care approach which often led to treatment 
with long-acting beta agonists that were not used in CAMP.
Similar to our phenotypes, clusters were also identified in a persistent asthma restricted 
population of 315 children, age 6 to 12 years in France,5 that included a highly sensitized 
cluster exhibiting the most severe asthma and a cluster with little evidence of sensitization 
exhibiting “mild asthma”.
An HCA among 161 children ages 6-17 years in the Severe Asthma Research Program 
(SARP) was less comparable to the APIC children.3 Four clusters varied primarily by their 
duration of asthma and degree of lung dysfunction with asthma severity being evenly 
distributed among the clusters. In contrast, the duration of asthma was not significantly 
different among APIC clusters but the level of symptomatic asthma, rate of asthma 
exacerbations and medication requirements varied greatly across the clusters (Table I). This, 
and other discrepancies, may be related to the restriction of SARP enrollment to participants 
considered to have difficult asthma with required demonstration of BHR or FEV1 
reversibility after albuterol. Similar to our findings, the SARP cluster with the least lung 
dysfunction and asthma medication requirements also had the least allergen sensitization, 
lowest total serum IgE and blood eosinophil counts.
A common limitation among unsupervised HCA is the selection of variables that are 
somewhat arbitrary and based on the authors’ opinions of which factors are likely to be 
discriminatory among asthma phenotypes. The variables may exclude potentially important

 host and environmental factors including specific dietary consumption, toxins, allergens or 
other risk-modifying exposures. Furthermore, although some variables may contribute to the 
pathogenesis of asthma in an independent manner, others may be dependent on complex 
interactions with other variables that would not necessarily be uncovered by cluster analysis. 
For example, cockroach allergen sensitization combined with high levels of exposure has 
been shown to have a substantial impact on asthma severity in inner-city children24 whereas 
evaluation of sensitization alone may miss this important risk factor. Also, some variables 
may lack adequate precision or may not fully represent a given domain, leading to a 
diminished ability to implicate factors that are truly distinguishing features of asthma 
phenotypes. For example, the stress domain was only represented in our study by the 10-
question caretaker Perceived Stress Score (PSS). This tool was recommended in the NIH/
AHRQ-sponsored Asthma Outcomes Workshop Expert Report as a brief, well-validated, and 
simply administered measure of global stress.31 However, the PSS does not necessarily 
capture aspects of chronic stress or other behavioral or psychosocial mediators of asthma 
outcomes that are common in inner-city living and have been linked to asthma severity, such 
as violence and severely negative life events.32-35 Another potential limitation is that data 
reduction techniques may contribute to the generation of inconsistent clusters that are more 
sensitive to relatively conservative shifts in the specific variables selected.19 However, at this 
time, there is no standard set of variables that can be universally recommended for inclusion 
in HCA. Finally, our findings may be specific for asthma phenotypes restricted to low-
income urban children and not generalizable to other populations.
In spite of these limitations, unsupervised clustering analyses can provide unique 
information related to the pathophysiology of asthma and other disorders by identifying 
specific disease characteristics that play a significant role in separating phenotypes. 
Knowledge of these characteristics can provide rationale for considering management 
options beyond current standardized treatment guidelines and allow potential targeted 
strategies to be directed toward those patients most likely to benefit.
In conclusion, there is significant asthma heterogeneity among children living in low-income 
areas of U.S. inner cities. We found that most asthma in this population appears to cluster by 
the degree of allergy, rhinitis, allergic inflammatory markers and impaired pulmonary 
physiology with these factors worsening in parallel and correlating with more severe disease. 
These findings provide a solid basis for personalized care where emphasis on environmental 
allergen management, allergen desensitization and anti-Th2 therapy is more appropriate for 
an allergic phenotype as opposed to the somewhat less-common persistently symptomatic 
phenotype with little allergy and inflammation that we also identified in this population.

 Clinical Implications
Management strategies targeting allergy and allergic inflammation are appropriate for 
most inner-city allergic asthma phenotypes. This approach may be misdirected in those 
exhibiting frequent symptoms but little allergy or allergic inflammation.

 Capsule Summary
Allergy is a distinguishing feature of asthma phenotypes among inner city children. 
Although severe pediatric asthma typically co-clusters with intensely allergic phenotypes, 
a highly symptomatic asthma phenotype with little allergy or allergic inflammation was 
identified.

 Figure 1. 
Dendrogram produced by the hierarchical clustering algorithm. Participants in Clusters A, 
B, C, D and E are denoted by the colors red, blue, green, purple, and orange respectively. 
The y-axis is a measure of dissimilarity between clusters such that the greater the height at 
which two clusters break off from one another, the greater the dissimilarity between the two 
clusters. The grey line indicates the height of the 5-cluster solution, as it cuts through 5 
vertical lines, each of which represents a cluster.

Characteristics of the population overall and by cluster. Unless otherwise noted, continuous variables are summarized using the mean and standard 
deviation while categorical variables are summarized using the frequency and percent. Any missing data for variables included in the hierarchical 
clustering algorithm were imputed. Unless otherwise noted, an overall test of the distribution of each characteristic across clusters was performed using an 
analysis of variance for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables.
