ABSTRACT
Background: It remains uncertain which diet is best for people with
type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Objective: We compared the effects of dietary carbohydrate
restriction with fat restriction on markers of metabolic syndrome and
quality of life in people with T2D.
Design: This systematic review of randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) compares the effects
of a low-carbohydrate [≤40% of energy (%)] diet with those of a
low-fat (≤30%) diet over a period of ≥4 wk in patients with T2D.
Two investigators independently selected studies, extracted data, and
assessed risk of bias. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to
assess the certainty of evidence. Pooled mean differences (MDs) and
95% CIs were calculated with the use of a random-effects model.
Results: Thirty-three RCTs and 3 CCTs (n = 2161) were included.
Glycated hemoglobin declined more in people who consumed low-
carbohydrate food than in those who consumed low-fat food in
the short term (MD: –1.38%; 95% CI: –2.64%, –0.11%; very-
low-certainty evidence). At 1 y, the MD was reduced to –0.36%
(95% CI: –0.58%, –0.14%; low-certainty evidence); at 2 y, the
difference had disappeared. There is low to high (majority moderate)
certainty for small improvements of unclear clinical importance in
plasma glucose, triglycerides, and HDL concentrations favoring low-
carbohydrate food at half of the prespecified time points. There was
little to no difference in LDL concentration or any of the secondary
outcomes (body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, quality
of life) in response to either of the diets (very-low- to high-certainty
evidence).
Conclusions: Currently available data provide low- to moderate-
certainty evidence that dietary carbohydrate restriction to a maxi-
mum of 40% yields slightly better metabolic control of uncertain
clinical importance than reduction in fat to a maximum of
30% in people with T2D. This systematic review is registered

INTRODUCTION
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a multifactorial disease, emanating
from gene-environment interactions (1). Diet quality and quantity
are at the heart of its pathogenesis (2). Although it is quite clear
that nutrition plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of T2D,
it remains unclear which dietary measures are most effective
in ameliorating metabolic derangements. There is little doubt,
however, that reduction in body fat stores dampens chronic
inflammation and improves metabolic anomalies. Thus, it is
perhaps unsurprising to note that dietary guidelines for T2D
tend to focus on weight loss as a primary goal. In this context,
the consumption of low-fat food has been advocated for many
years, inspired by at least 2 assumptions. First, that because fat
contains more calories per gram, consuming less fat will reduce
fat stores more than restricting protein or carbohydrate intake,
and second, that consumption of (saturated) fat is associated
with dyslipidemia (elevated LDL-cholesterol concentrations) and

cardiovascular disease, and the main complications of diabetes
mellitus all relate to vascular obstruction. However, the most
recent clinical guideline recommendations conclude that “as
there is no single ideal dietary distribution among carbohydrates,
fats and proteins for people with diabetes, distribution should be
individualized while keeping total calories and metabolic goals
in mind” (3). This conclusion has been challenged in a number
of reports, which claim that restriction of carbohydrates, and in
particular refined carbohydrates, is most effective in redressing
metabolic anomalies in T2D (4–6). This position concurs with
common sense, because carbohydrates are the only (direct)
source of glucose in the diet. It goes without saying that dietary
restriction of sugar and starch (chains of glucose monomers
linked by glycosidic bonds) is therefore expected to lower blood
glucose peaks. Moreover, because any excess glucose is readily
converted into (saturated) fat by hepatic de novo lipogenesis and
subsequently secreted as VLDL triglycerides (7), the restriction
of starchy food is expected to reduce plasma triglyceride
concentrations. However, none of the available reports, which
include several systematic reviews, specifically compared the
impact of low-carbohydrate diets with that of low-fat diets
on glucose control, body weight, and plasma lipid profiles
in people with T2D. Indeed, the majority of these compared
the effects of carbohydrate-restricted with -unrestricted diets,
which increases the possibility of imbalanced energy content
of comparator diets (see Discussion). We present the results
of a systematic review and meta-analysis of available data
comparing the effects of low-carbohydrate with low-fat dietary
interventions on glucose control and other important metabolic
and anthropometric variables, as well as on quality of life in
individuals with T2D. Grading of Recommendations Assessment
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used
to rate the certainty of the evidence (8).
METHODS
This systematic review is reported according to the PRISMA
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses) statement (9) and in concordance with the cor-
responding prospectively registered protocol in PROSPERO
(CRD42017052467) (10).
Eligibility criteria
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
controlled clinical trials (CCTs), which compared a low-
carbohydrate diet with a low-fat diet over a period of ≥4 wk
in adult patients (aged ≥18 y) with T2D. A low-carbohydrate
diet was defined as any dietary intervention containing ≤40%
of energy (%) from carbohydrate and a low-fat diet as one
containing ≤30% from fat. The value of 40% from carbohydrate
was chosen as the upper limit for inclusion, because this
represents the most common minimum carbohydrate intake
at a global level (12). Studies that stated clearly, in the
Methods section, their intention to meet these cutoffs of energy
percentages were eligible for inclusion. However, if the actual
intake of any one of the macronutrients exceeded 2% above these
limits, these data were not included in the final analysis. We also
only included data from crossover trials that had incorporated
wash-out periods of ≥4 wk between interventions. In the absence
of an adequate wash-out period, we used the data from these
trials only if we were able to extract the relevant data for the
first phase (i.e., before the crossover), because we considered
the risk of carryover effects to be prohibitive. We excluded
studies that included people with other chronic diseases, except
for hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Studies were also
excluded if they included participants who were using systemic
corticosteroids, had any (progressive) disease requiring hospital
care, or included those with an eating disorder or any other
disease necessitating special dietary requirements (except for
sodium restriction).
Literature search
All the search strategies for the various databases (Supple-
mental Table 1) were designed and tested by a medical research
librarian. The searches included the following databases—
Medline, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Li-
brary, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CEN-
TRAL), Emcare, Academic Search Premier, ScienceDirect, Latin
American and Caribbean Health Science Information database
(LILACS), and Índice Bibliográfico Español en Ciencias de
Salud (IBECS)—and covered the period from inception up to
21 March 2017. Additional searches were conducted in the fol-
lowing trial registers (www.isrctn.com/, www.clinicaltrials.gov,
http://www.anzctr.org.au/, http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/, www.
clinicaltrialsregister.eu). Two review authors (EJvZ and ZF)
also examined the bibliographies of the included and ex-
cluded studies and the Public Health Collaboration database
(https://phcuk.org/rcts/) for further references to potentially
eligible studies. Finally, we checked the bibliographic reference
lists of previous systematic reviews that had covered this clinical
topic.
Study selection
Two of the authors (EJvZ and ZF) independently assessed
the titles and abstracts of studies identified from the searches
and, if necessary, obtained and reviewed the full-text versions
to establish whether they met the inclusion criteria. Any
disagreements on eligibility were resolved through discussion
to reach consensus and, when necessary, by involving a third
author (HP). Studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria
were excluded. The number of reports retrieved, the number of
included and excluded studies, and the reasons for their exclusion
are presented in Figure 1.
Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment
Two of the authors (EJvZ and ZF) independently collected
study details and outcomes data using a piloted data extraction
form, and any disagreements on data entry were resolved
through discussion or by consultation with a third author (HP).
We extracted study characteristics (design, year of publication,
setting, country of origin, duration of intervention, and follow-
up), and patients’characteristics (sample size, sex, age, inclusion
and exclusion criteria, number of dropouts and reasons for loss
to follow-up, baseline data, medication for diabetes). Key details
were extracted on the diet (% from carbohydrates, protein,
and fat; program support measures and degree of compliance;
targeted intake and actual intake; whether diets were isocaloric

and aimed at weight maintenance or weight loss), exercise, our
prespecified primary and secondary outcomes, and information
on funding and declarations of interest. The trial investigators and
sponsors of included studies that were <10 y old were contacted
for additional trial details and missing data.
Our primary outcomes were change from baseline in glycated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration in whole blood and plasma
glucose, triglyceride, and HDL- and LDL-cholesterol concen-
trations in the fasted condition. Our secondary outcomes were
change from baseline in body weight, BMI, waist circumference,
blood pressure, and quality of life. We grouped data in short-
term (<8 wk), medium-low-term (≥8–16 wk), medium-high-
term (≥16–26 wk), and long-term (>26 wk) measurements.
Two of the authors (EJvZ and ZF) independently assessed the
risk of bias for each RCT with the use of the Cochrane Collab-
oration’
s domain-based assessment tool (11). Inconsistencies in
judgments were resolved through discussion or by involving a
third author (HP). The overall risk of bias for each study was
determined as follows: “low risk of bias” when all domains
were assessed as low risk (plausible bias unlikely to seriously
alter the results); “unclear risk of bias” when ≥1 domain was
classified as an unclear risk (plausible bias that raises some doubt
about the results); and “high risk of bias” when ≥1 domain was
judged as being at high risk (plausible bias that seriously weakens
confidence in the results). For nonrandomized controlled trials we
used ROBINS-I (7-domain tool) to assess the risk of bias (13). An
overall risk of bias was assigned on the basis of the assessment
of each domain as low, moderate, serious, or critical, with the
minimum overall risk typically determined by the highest risk
assigned in any individual domain.
Statistical analysis
All of the prespecified outcomes for this systematic review
were only reported as continuous data, for which we calculated
the mean differences (MDs) with their associated 95% CIs, and
carried out a complete case analysis if data were missing or
incomplete. Heterogeneity between the studies in effect measures
was assessed by using the I ² statistic, with an I ² > 50% indicative
of substantial heterogeneity. We combined studies that evaluated
similar outcomes and pooled their data in a meta-analysis
independently of the observed heterogeneity. Following the
recommendations of the GRADE working group, we considered
downgrading the certainty of evidence for inconsistency when I2
> 50%, while taking other considerations for downgrading into

account (8). We intended to assess publication bias on the basis of
the recommendations on testing for funnel plot asymmetry (14),
but the paucity of studies evaluating any of the outcomes at the
same specific time points did not permit such an assessment. The
lack of an adequate number of included studies reporting on the
subgroups specified in our protocol precluded any attempts to
carry out our planned subgroup analyses.
The data reported for our predefined outcomes were pooled,
where possible, with the use of a random-effects model and
presented in forest plots. All of the analyses were undertaken
using RevMan 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre).
To explore sources of statistical heterogeneity between studies
and to assess the robustness of our data, we conducted several
sensitivity analyses. We repeated our analyses with the use of
the fixed-effects model to enable an assessment of the influence
of small-study effects on the results of any of the meta-analyses
in which there was evidence of between-study heterogeneity
(I2 > 0%; see Supplemental Figure 1). We also undertook
sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of excluding studies at
overall high risk of bias (see Supplemental Figure 2) and the
impact of excluding studies that were the cause of substantial
heterogeneity (see Supplemental Figure 3).
Certainty of evidence
We applied the GRADE approach with the use of GRADE-
proGDT (http://gradepro.org) to assess the certainty of evidence
for the predefined outcomes, as presented in the Summary of
Findings (Tables 3–6). This approach takes into consideration
the following: study limitations (risk of bias), inconsistency of
results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision, and publication
bias. Two of the authors (EJvZ and TK) independently rated the
certainty of evidence for the prespecified outcomes as “high,”
“moderate,” “low,” and “very low,” and discrepancies were
resolved by consensus or with input from a third author (ZF or
HP).
RESULTS
Search results
Our searches across the databases identified 993 articles and
91 further references to abstracts. Nine additional records were
found through other resources and hand-searching, and we also
identified 9 ongoing trials (Figure 1). After examination of the
titles and abstracts and the removal of any duplicate publications,
we excluded 950 references. A total of 138 full-text copies were
obtained for further evaluation. Of these, we excluded 9 ongoing
studies that had not published any data and 46 studies that were
co-publications (studies that were published more than once, or
had evaluated other outcomes from the same study population).
We also excluded 47 studies (15–61) for other reasons, the most
important of which were that the composition of the diets did
not meet our inclusion criteria (i.e., the prespecified cutoffs) or
that the actual intake during the study appeared to be higher than
the agreed or prescribed percentages of carbohydrates or fat (or
both). Other reasons for exclusion were that studies did not appear
to have been conducted in patients with T2D, that there were
insufficient details reported on the content of the diets, or that the
study duration was too short. For more details, see Supplemental
Tables 2–5.
Study characteristics
Thirty-six studies (33 RCTs and 3 CCTs), which evaluated
a total of 2161 patients, were included in this systematic
review (62–97). Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of
these studies. Supplemental Table 6 provides more detailed
information on the 36 studies as well as the specific judgments
per risk-of-bias domain for each study. Four studies included
only men, 3 included only women, and the remainder included
both men and women in varying proportions. Samples sizes were
rather small (ranging from <20 to 60 patients) in most of the
studies, with only 8 studies evaluating >100 patients (66–68,
76, 86, 89, 93, 96). The mean age of participants was 56.6 y
and was consistent across the studies (mean range: 32–65 y;
majority between 50 and 60 y). A majority of the studies had a
2-arm design (n = 31), and the remainder included 3-arm studies
(n = 4) and one 4-arm study. Most of the studies were conducted
in Europe (n = 14) or in the United States and Canada (n = 15).
One study was conducted in Mexico, 2 in Israel, 2 in Japan, and a
further 2 in Australia. Study duration varied from 4 wk extending
to 7 y in 1 outlying study, with an overall mean period of 33
wk (exclusion of the outlier would provide a more representative
mean of 24 wk). A total of 19 studies were conducted before
2000, and the remaining 17 after the year 2000.
In 9 of the studies, the meals were provided by the hospital
or were home delivered, or patients were hospitalized throughout
the study (62, 64, 65, 69–71, 81, 84, 88). In the other studies,
patients underwent specific training by a dietitian, were provided
with a list of foods to be consumed, and received regular follow-
up sessions (phone calls, hospital visits) to ensure adherence to
the dietary recommendations.
Eight of the studies encouraged an increase in physical activity
by participants during the study period (66, 68, 72, 76, 81, 83,
87, 93). The study by Bozzetto et al. (63), which examined
the effects of diet-exercise interaction, included a mandatory
supervised exercise program in 2 of the 4 arms, but we only
included data from the arms without exercise because the focus
of this systematic review was a specific comparison of dietary
interventions.
In 16 studies, the diets were isocaloric (62–64, 68–71, 73, 81,
85, 88, 90, 91, 93–95). Nine studies aimed for weight reduction
by calorie restriction in both diets (66, 68, 72–75, 81, 83, 93), and
in 2 studies (89, 97) only one of the diets was calorie restricted.
In 8 studies, the calorie intake was adjusted to maintain constant
body weight (62–65, 70, 84, 88, 95).
The review included 17 crossover trials, and in 14 there
was no washout, or the washout period was <4 wk, which
we considered too short to exclude potential carryover effects.
Because there were no data reported separately for each phase
(data were combined for both phases), we were unable to use
these 14 studies, although they matched our inclusion criteria
(see Supplemental Table 4) (62, 64, 65, 69–71, 77, 80, 85, 88,
90–92, 95). The metabolic effects of dietary interventions can
persist for a variable length of time (depending on the nature of
the intervention), and the carryover effects can bias the analysis
of data obtained in the second intervention periods if the wash-
out period is too short. The 3 remaining crossover studies had a

wash-out period of ≥4 wk and provided data that we were able
to include in the meta-analyses (78, 84, 94).
The data from 5 of the RCTs were unusable (see Supplemental
Table 4). One study (79) did not address any of our outcomes,
1 study (82) did not provide separate data for patients with
type 1 diabetes and T2D, 3 other studies (76, 86, 87) targeted
our criteria of a low-carbohydrate compared with a low-fat diet
(%) but appeared to subsequently exceed our cutoff values by
>2% at follow-up. Furthermore, in the study by Samaha et al.
(86), data are reported on some outcomes for diabetics (glucose,
insulin, and HbA1c), but it is unclear how many diabetic patients
remained in each intervention group throughout the study period.
The report indicated that there was a 40% drop-out rate but
also failed to clarify how many diabetics dropped out in each
intervention group, which did not permit further analysis of the
data. Overall, out of the 36 included studies, only 17 provided
data that could be further analyzed and subsequently entered into
the meta-analyses.
Our predefined outcomes were evaluated as follows—HbA1c
(25 studies); plasma concentrations in the fasted condition:
glucose (29 studies), triglycerides (31 studies), HDL cholesterol
(30 studies), and LDL cholesterol (28 studies); body weight (23
studies); BMI (10 studies); waist circumference (7 studies); blood
pressure (11 studies); and quality of life (5 studies).
Sources of funding were reported in all but 2 of the studies
(78, 97). Declarations of conflicts of interest were only reported
in 4 studies (72, 74, 87, 96), but we considered that either funding
or conflicts of interest might have resulted in potential bias in 6
(72, 75, 90–92, 96) of the studies, in which the Sugar Foundation,
Mars, or other food industry provided funding for the study or the
investigators received honoraria from these entities.
Risk-of-bias assessment
The risk-of-bias assessments for the 33 included RCTs are
presented in Figure 2. We were successful in contacting trialists
and clarifying trial details and subsequently amending our
judgments in several of the risk-of-bias domains for 3 studies
(63, 66, 94). We further categorized the overall risk of bias for
the 33 studies, 19 of which were judged to be at high risk of bias
and the remaining 14 studies at unclear risk of bias. The most
important reasons why studies were considered at high risk of
bias was the lack of a washout period (or too short of a washout
period) between diets in the crossover studies (n = 13) or a high
drop-out rate (n = 8), or both and 1 study (68) appeared to be
quasi-randomized. (See Table 1 for summarized assessments of
risk of bias and Supplemental Table 6 for detailed risk-of-bias
judgments.)
The risk-of-bias assessments for the 3 CCTs (70, 74, 83) are
shown separately in Table 2. The overall risk of bias in these
studies varied from moderate to serious risk of bias.
Outcomes
Sensitivity analyses were carried out for our meta-analyses,
where applicable, and are presented for our prespecified out-
comes in Supplemental Figures 1–3 (see also under “Statistical
analysis” above). The robustness of our results was underpinned

by the minimal divergence in effect estimates between our meta-
analyses and the sensitivity analyses, which at no stage reached
a clinically important difference.
Change from baseline in HbA1c
This outcome was assessed and reported in 14 studies, some
of which provided data within several measurement time points
(63, 66–68, 72, 73, 78, 83, 84, 89, 93, 94, 96, 97). In contrast with
low-fat diets, low-carbohydrate diets improved HbA1c at almost
all time points, but the difference diminished over time, which
is unremarkable in view of the well-acknowledged difficulties of
adherence to dietary changes over extended periods of time (see
Figure 3; very-low- to moderate-certainty evidence).
Change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose concentration
Data for this outcome were provided by 14 studies (63, 67, 68,
72, 74, 75, 78, 81, 83, 89, 93, 94, 96, 97; see Figure 4). In 2 time
windows, the low-carbohydrate diets induced a greater decrease
in fasting glucose concentration than the low-fat diets (≥8–16 wk
and ≥16–26 wk; moderate-certainty evidence).
Change from baseline in fasting triglyceride concentration
Fifteen studies evaluated triglycerides in the fasting condition
(63, 66–68, 72–75, 78, 81, 84, 93, 94, 96, 97; see Figure 5).
Although there was a trend toward an effect in favor of the
low-carbohydrate data, only the data reported beyond 16 wk
favored the low-carbohydrate diets (moderate- to high-certainty
evidence).
Change from baseline in fasting HDL-cholesterol concentration
This outcome was assessed in 12 studies (63, 66, 68, 72–
74, 78, 81, 84, 93, 94, 96; see Figure 6). The pooled data
at several time points showed an increase in HDL cholesterol
in favor of the low-carbohydrate diets (low- to moderate-
certainty evidence), which persisted at 2 y, but the latter
was based on data available from only 2 of the studies
(73, 93).
Change from baseline in fasting LDL-cholesterol concentration
Twelve studies reported data on this outcome (63, 66, 68, 72–
74, 78, 84, 93, 94, 96, 97), with little to no difference shown
between the 2 diet arms at any time point (moderate- to high-
certainty evidence; see Figure 7).
Change from baseline in body weight
A total of 16 studies provided data for this outcome (63, 66–
68, 72–75, 78, 81, 83, 84, 93, 94, 96, 97; see Supplemental
Figure 4). There was a small effect (MD: −2.04 kg, 95% CI:
−3.23, −0.85 kg) only at ≥8–16 wk in favor of low-carbohydrate
food (high-certainty evidence).
Change from baseline in BMI
Seven studies evaluated the effect of the 2 diets on BMI over
time (68, 72, 73, 83, 93, 94, 97). There was little to no difference
between the 2 dietary approaches at the assessed time points (low-
to high-certainty evidence; see Supplemental Figure 5).
Change from baseline in waist circumference
Change in waist circumference was measured in 6 studies (63,
68, 72, 73, 93, 96). There was no to little difference between low-
carbohydrate food and low-fat food at the assessed time points
(low- to high-certainty evidence; see Supplemental Figure 6).
Change from baseline in blood pressure
Seven studies investigated the effects of both types of diets
on blood pressure (66, 73, 84, 93, 94, 96, 97). For both systolic
as well as diastolic blood pressure, there were possibly no
differences in effects between the 2 diets (low- to high-certainty
evidence), except at 6 mo, where diastolic blood pressure
probably declined more with low-carbohydrate food (MD: −1.91
mm Hg; 95% CI: −3.63, −0.18 mm Hg; see Supplemental
Figures 7 and 8).

Change from baseline in quality of life
Four studies provided data on quality of life (66, 73, 96, 97).
The data in the study by Davis et al. (66) were reported in a
subsequent article published in 2012 (see Supplemental Table 5),
but they were not reported separately per treatment arm, which
did not permit reliable conclusions to be drawn with regard to
the effects of each individual diet on quality of life. The authors
reported that the primary goal of their analysis was “to determine
whether the dietary strategy used for weight loss would have
differential effects on quality of life.” Of the 46 out of 105
participants who completed the study, there were reductions in
the Diabetes-39 questionnaire scores related to sexual function,
energy, and mobility, but the investigators “did not observe any
changes in diabetes-specific quality of life measures that differed
between dietary arms.” Data of Wolever et al. (96) were also
addressed in a subsequent paper (see Supplemental Table 5). A
Quality of Life questionnaire was used, which was adapted from
validated questionnaires. No exact data were provided but the
authors reported “no significant differences between baseline and
end of study and no significant changes among diets.”
Effects of dietary interventions per time window
Short-term measurements (<8 weeks)
The data up to 8 wk as well as the certainty of evidence are
summarized in Table 3. However, because the possible causes
of heterogeneity are not fully captured in this table, we provide
details to accompany this and the following tables.
The substantial heterogeneity between studies for HbA1c
is likely due to a significant increase in HbA1c in the high-
carbohydrate (low-fat) group in the study by Lerman-Garber et
al. (78), which may be attributable to the baseline imbalance of
HbA1c, by the relatively high (60%) carbohydrate content of
the high-carbohydrate diet, or both. Furthermore, consideration

 LOW-CARBOHYDRATE DIET VS. LOW-FAT DIET FOR T2D

should also be given to the rather large (35%) drop-out rate in
this study.
For fasting glucose, heterogeneity was almost completely
caused by the study by Hockaday et al. (75), in which the
low-fat-diet group did clearly better than the low-carbohydrate
group. However, this may have been due to the fact that plasma
glucose concentrations at baseline were substantially higher in
the participants receiving the low-fat diet.
Heterogeneity between studies for fasting triglycerides was
primarily caused by the study by Gumbiner et al. (74),
which reported a considerable reduction in plasma triglyceride
concentrations in participants following the low-carbohydrate
diet. This may have been due to the significant difference in
macronutrient composition between the dietary interventions
in this study. The low-carbohydrate diet had only 9.5% from
carbohydrate and 70% from fat, whereas the low-fat diet had
70% from carbohydrates and only 10% from fat. All of the other
included studies had ±40% from carbohydrates in their low-
carbohydrate intervention.
The heterogeneity between studies for fasting HDL cholesterol
was largely attributable to the results reported by Miyashita et al.
(81). It remains unclear why the HDL-cholesterol concentrations
increased more in response to low-carbohydrate food in this study
(even in the absence of effects on triglyceride concentrations)
than the other included studies.
Medium-term measurements (≥8–16 wk)
The results for this time window for each of the prespecified
outcomes as well as the certainty of the evidence are presented
in Table 4. Heterogeneity for the pooled data on HbA1c was
primarily caused by the study by Nielsen et al. (83). There was
a larger reduction in HbA1c in this study than in the other 3
studies, probably because the carbohydrate content of the low-
carbohydrate diet in this study was only 20%, as opposed to
30–40% in the other 3 studies. Moreover, this CCT was at
serious risk of bias, because participants who were assigned
to low-carbohydrate food were recruited via an informational
meeting on alternative dietary interventions, whereas the control
group did not attend that meeting for unclear reasons (but
likely because they were not interested). Thus, the intervention
group showed interest in their condition and in alternative
dietary strategies, whereas participants in the control group were

apparently less than interested. Affinity with or preference for
a specific intervention is most likely to have an impact on the
outcome.
With regard to change from baseline in BMI, 2 studies
compared both low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets, but they
were very different in other respects. The CCT (83), as just
mentioned, had a serious risk of bias (see above), and the
dietary interventions studied were calorie restricted and very low
carbohydrate (20%), and participants were instructed to exercise
30 min/d. Conversely, in the study by Walker et al. (94), the low-
carbohydrate intervention contained 40% from carbohydrate, it
was not calorie restricted, and the participants were advised to
maintain usual physical activity. These differences may, to a large
extent, explain the heterogeneity between the studies.
The heterogeneity in the data of change in systolic blood
pressure [greater decline with low-carbohydrate food in Davis
et al. (66)] may have been caused by the fact that the % of
carbohydrates of actual intake in the low-carbohydrate group at
that time point was 24% in the study by Davis et al. (66) compared
with 40% in Walker et al. (94).
Medium-term measurement (≥16–26 wk)
Data on the prespecified outcomes as well as the certainty of
evidence for this time period are shown in Table 5. Heterogeneity
between studies for HbA1c was caused by 2 of the studies
(67, 93). The reductions in HbA1c in both of these were
substantial in both diet arms, but it remains unclear why
the difference in HbA1c reduction between low-carbohydrate
and low-fat diets in these studies was relatively small. The
participant characteristics, medications used (and discontinuance
of medication during the study), dietary composition, or drop-
out rate do not appear to differ significantly between studies.
Tay et al. (93) reported a significant difference in favor of
the low-carbohydrate intervention between the 2 diet groups in
participants with a high HbA1c at baseline (>7.8%), but there
was no difference between groups as a whole.
Heterogeneity between studies for fasting glucose was primar-
ily caused by the same 2 studies (67, 93). It remains unclear
why these studies differed from the other studies in terms of
the response of fasting plasma glucose concentrations to dietary
intervention.

 LOW-CARBOHYDRATE DIET VS. LOW-FAT DIET FOR T2D

the average effect size of the studies. carb, carbohydrate; IV, inverse variance.
The heterogeneity between studies for fasting HDL cholesterol
was fully attributable to the slight reduction in HDL cholesterol
in response to low-carbohydrate food in 2 of the studies
(67, 72). This discordance in the data may be due to the relatively
high baseline HDL-cholesterol concentrations in both studies,
which paves the way for random changes (regression) toward
a lower mean on subsequent measurement. We were unable
to identify other differences between the included studies that
might provide an explanation for the heterogeneity or variability
in HDL-cholesterol concentrations in response to the dietary
intervention.
For the outcome of change from baseline in body weight
as well as BMI, heterogeneity was essentially caused by 2 of
the studies (72, 83), which showed the greatest differences in
body weight favoring the low-carbohydrate group. The CCT
by Nielsen et al. (83) was at serious risk of bias, as discussed
under the former time window, with the participants in the
low-carbohydrate diet group being presumably more adherent
due to the counseling ahead of the study. Although the energy
content of the actual dietary intake was not reported, the very-
low-carbohydrate diet utilized in the study by Goday et al. (72)
had far fewer calories (600–800 kcal in the “active” phase)
than the low-fat diet (500–1000 kcal restriction according to
each individual’
s basal metabolic rate). All of the heterogeneity
between the studies evaluating change from baseline in waist
circumference can be attributed to Goday et al. (72), perhaps
because the low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet in this study
had far fewer calories than the low-fat intervention, whereas
both interventions were energy-matched in the other studies
(73, 93).
Both Guldbrand et al. (73) and Yamada et al. (97) reported
6-mo data on changes in quality of life, but used different
measurement scales. Quality-of-life data from the study by
Guldbrand et al. (73) were published in a subsequent article in
2014 (see Supplemental Table 5). Data were collected by using
the generic Short Form–36 (SF-36), a 36-item questionnaire
covering 8 health domains, with each domain scoring from
0 to 100 (higher score indicating better quality of life). The
investigators calculated both the combined physical component
score (PCS) and the mental component score (MCS). The
questionnaire was completed at month 6 by 23 patients in the
low-carbohydrate group and by 22 in the low-fat intervention

group. The mean ± SD change from baseline in PCS at 6 mo
was −0.90 ± 7.44 in the low-carbohydrate group compared
with 0.50 ± 6.30 in the low-fat group. The mean ± SD
change from baseline in MCS was −1.70 ± 8.43 in the low-
carbohydrate diet group compared with 1.80 ± 6.30 in the low-fat
group.
In the study by Yamada et al. (97), 2 different instruments were
used: the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ)
and the Problem Areas in Diabetes scale (PAID). The DTSQ
measures treatment satisfaction in patients with diabetes and
covers 6 satisfaction items on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 to 6,
with a maximum total of 36 points, with higher scores indicating
greater satisfaction (98). The PAID score covers a 20-item survey
and evaluates the degree to which diabetes management or
feelings about diabetes are problematic to people with diabetes
(99). Each item is scored on a Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4,
with the sum of all item scores multiplied by 1.25 to obtain the
overall PAID score (range from 0 to 100), with a higher score
reflecting more significant diabetes-related emotional distress.
For the DTSQ, the total score (± SD) increased from 24.0 ±
6.6 by 3.60 ± 3.98 at 6 mo in the 12 patients following a low-
carbohydrate diet compared with an increase from 21.6 ± 3.3
by 3.10 ± 2.72 in the 12 patients following the calorie-restricted
(low-fat) diet. Both diets showed small improvements in quality
of life with no to little difference between the diets. The PAID
scores (± SD) changed from 42.1 ± 13.5 by −4.30 ± 8.12 in
the low-carbohydrate-diet group and from 57.8 ± 12.6 by −0.60
± 7.78 in the calorie-restricted (low-fat) diet group. Although
the magnitude of changes in both quality-of-life instruments
required for clinical significance (minimal important difference)
has not been established, the subtle improvements measured in
both intervention arms are unlikely to be of clinical relevance.
Long-term measurement (>26 weeks)
The long-term measurement results of the prespecified
outcomes and the certainty of evidence are summarized in
Table 6. The substantial heterogeneity between studies of change
from baseline in fasting glucose was almost fully attributable to
the differing results of 2 of the studies (75, 96). The beneficial
effect of low-fat food in the study by Hockaday et al. (75) may
have been biased by the higher glucose concentrations at baseline
in the participants assigned to receive low-fat food. The relatively
minor difference in fasting glucose concentrations in response
to low-fat compared with low-carbohydrate food in the study by
Wolever et al. (96) may have been due to the fact that the low-fat
intervention contained only low-glycemic-index carbohydrates

within the carbohydrate component. In fact, in this study, the
effects of low-fat, low-glycemic-index food were compared with
those of low-carbohydrate food.
The heterogeneity between the studies for change from
baseline in fasting triglycerides was fully attributable to the more
substantial decrease in triglycerides in response to carbohydrate
restriction in one of the studies (68). A possible explanation
could be that baseline plasma triglyceride concentrations were
substantially higher in this study than in any of the other included
studies (elevated concentrations almost always predict better
response).
The heterogeneity between the studies for pooled data on
fasting HDL cholesterol is fully explained by the relatively
robust increase in HDL-cholesterol concentrations in response
to low-carbohydrate food in the study by Elhayany et al. (68),
which is most likely explained by the considerable concomitant
decline in plasma triglyceride concentrations achieved in that
study. Reduction in circulating (VLDL) triglycerides limits the
exchange of cholesteryl esters between HDL and VLDL particles
and thereby increases HDL cholesterol.
Almost all of the heterogeneity between the studies of
the meta-analysis for data on change from baseline in LDL
cholesterol was caused by the data from 1 study (68), which
reported diametrically opposing results (larger decline in LDL
cholesterol in response to the low-carbohydrate diet). This
difference is difficult to explain but may be due to the differences
in sex distribution and ethnicity between participants. It may
also reflect differences in diet quality between the studies.
Elhayany et al. (68) compared low-carbohydrate, low-glycemic-
index Mediterranean food with low-fat food according to the
American Diabetes Association guideline, including mixed high-
and low-glycemic-index carbohydrates. The quality (i.e., type
of distinct macronutrients) of the dietary interventions in the
study by Davis et al. (66) remains obscure but may have differed
substantially.
The only study that addressed quality of life at 1 and 2 y was
Guldbrand et al. (73). At 12 mo, the mean ± SD change from
baseline in the low-carbohydrate group (n = 27) for the PCS was
2.60 ± 6.50 and 0.60 ± 6.32 in the low-fat group (n = 28) and
for the MCS was 0.90 ± 4.34 compared with 1.10 ± 6.11. At

DISCUSSION
Principal findings and interpretation
This systematic review of 36 RCTs and CCTs (including
2161 patients) is the first, to our knowledge, to comprehensively
and specifically compare the effects of low-carbohydrate with
low-fat food on glucose control, the plasma lipid cardiovascular
risk profile, and body weight of persons with T2D. Our results
suggest that there is, in general, little to no difference between the
metabolic effects of diets containing ≤40% from carbohydrates
(“low carb”) and diets containing ≤30% from fat (“low fat”).
A low-carbohydrate diet may reduce HbA1c compared with
a low-fat diet, particularly in the short and medium term up
to 1 y, but we are uncertain about this effect. At 2 y, the
difference between the effects of either diet on HbA1c had
disappeared. The fact that all metabolic measurements tended
to return to baseline values in both groups after 2 y suggests
that lack of compliance with dietary prescriptions may have
played a role. Although carbohydrate restriction more clearly
improves other metabolic variables at many of the prespecified
time points, the differences with the effects of low-fat food
are of doubtful clinical importance and supported by only low
to moderately certain evidence. Because the minimal clinically
important difference for most of these metabolic variables has not
been determined, our inference with regard to clinical meaning
is arguable.
Both dietary strategies similarly affected LDL-cholesterol
concentrations, which may come as a surprise, because (some)
SFAs tend to increase LDL-cholesterol concentrations. However,
this is particularly true if dietary PUFAs are substituted by SFAs.
Substitution of carbohydrates by saturated fat has less of an
effect on LDL-cholesterol concentrations (100). Blood pressure
response (systolic as well as diastolic) was also not significantly
different, although low-carbohydrate food may reduce diastolic
pressure slightly more than low-fat food in the medium term.
All of these metabolic effects occur in the face of little to no
differences in losses of body weight or waist circumference.
There may be no important improvement in quality of life in
response to either dietary strategy in the few studies assessing this
outcome. The certainty of evidence for the secondary outcomes
varied from very low to high, but is predominantly low at the
various time points.

16We did not downgrade for inconsistency. Although I2 = 82%, the 95% CIs overlap, and we already downgraded for imprecision and decided not to

17We did not downgrade for imprecision. Although the minimal important difference is not established, based on clinical expertise, reductions of
<4 mm Hg are not considered important. Therefore, the effect estimate is rather precise.
18Downgraded 2 levels for very serious imprecision, very low sample size.
Although all measurable differences between the metabolic
effects of low-carbohydrate diets and those of low-fat diets were
in favor of low-carbohydrate food, they were small, of uncertain
clinical importance, and supported by only low- to moderate-
certainty evidence according to GRADE. These observations
are counterintuitive, because carbohydrates are the only (direct)
source of glucose in our diet, and restriction of carbohydrate
consumption is therefore expected to lower blood glucose and
HbA1c as well as triglyceride concentrations. Substantial clinical
and methodologic heterogeneity between eligible studies may
contribute to the apparent lack of differences (see below). The
relatively mild restriction of carbohydrate content of most low-
carbohydrate diet interventions included in the review (25–40%)
may have also played a role. However, the results of 3 studies
comparing very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets with low-fat
interventions (72, 74, 93) do not substantially deviate from those
of other included trials.
Strengths and limitations of the review
The key strengths of our review are underlined by the more
prescriptive approach used in setting out our selection criteria,

which enabled the answering of a clearly defined clinical question
on the comparison of 2 explicit dietary strategies for management
of T2D. Any methodologic difference between this review and
earlier reviews is most likely reflected in the rapidly evolving
nature of the process of conducting systematic reviews, such
as the use of the GRADE approach to evaluate the certainty of
evidence.
The high degree of clinical and methodologic heterogeneity
between the included studies may be the most important reason
for the apparent lack of relevant distinction between the effects
of both dietary strategies. For example, the energy percentage
of macronutrients in the prescription diets differed considerably.
Some low-carbohydrate interventions were indeed very low
(<20%) in carbohydrate (72, 74, 93), whereas others were
only mildly restrictive, and previous reports suggest that HbA1c
declines in proportion to the energy percentage of carbohydrates
in the diet (10). Similarly, in some studies (74, 81), the fat
content of the low-fat intervention was much lower (<15%)
than in others. Moreover, the nature of the fat component of
low-carbohydrate diets differed considerably between studies,
which is a potential confounder of study outcomes, because
distinct fatty acids differentially affect (glucose) metabolism
(101). In addition, the quality of the carbohydrate component
(simple or complex) of interventions often remains obscure,
although it is of critical importance for the metabolic response
to dietary regimes (102). Numerous other aspects differed
considerably between studies, including calorie content, exercise
prescription, provision of food by the study center, and reporting
of actual food intake. Medication regimes (glucose-, blood
pressure–, and lipid-lowering) were modified in some studies,
whereas they remained unchanged in others. Some of the
studies included medication-naïve patients, whereas other reports
failed to document medication details adequately. Notably, and
significantly, in all of the studies that included patients taking
medication and that adequately reported eventual adaptations
(66, 73, 83, 93), with the exception of one (67), glucose-
lowering drug doses were reduced in participants who consumed
low-carbohydrate food, but not in those consuming low-fat

 LOW-CARBOHYDRATE DIET VS. LOW-FAT DIET FOR T2D

food. Unfortunately, inconsistent methods of quantification and
reporting precluded reliable statistical analysis of changes in drug
doses.
Comparison to other (systematic) reviews
We identified 21 systematic reviews and evidence syntheses
focusing on the effects of low-carbohydrate diets on metabolic
outcome variables, dating back to 2006 (for a complete list,
see Supplemental Table 7). Only one of these specifically
compared the effects of a low-carbohydrate diet with those
of low-fat diets on components of the metabolic syndrome
in the treatment of T2D (103). The low-carbohydrate dietary
interventions in the studies included in the review contained
<40% from carbohydrate, and the low-fat diets contained <25%
from fat. The investigators concluded that “replacing fat with
carbohydrate could deteriorate insulin resistance,” with adverse
effects on triglycerides and HDL cholesterol (which could
be avoided by energy restriction). There were no significant
differences between the effects of either diet on HbA1c or
blood glucose concentration in the fasted condition. However,
the studies included in the review lasted for a maximum of
12 wk, with the vast majority lasting only 2–6 wk, which is far too
short a period to reliably judge the effects on HbA1c. The other
available reviews of low-carbohydrate interventions had either
different outcome parameters (primarily weight loss), included
studies with other comparison diets, or focused on other target
groups (i.e., obese individuals).
Implications of the findings
This analysis does not support the long-held preference for
low-fat diets as the default dietary intervention for T2D. Instead,
the results suggest that, if it fits the patients’ preferences,
restriction of carbohydrates may be slightly better, although the
clinical benefits are uncertain.
Unanswered questions and future research
Randomized controlled intervention studies comparing the
effects of very-low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diets with those of
low-fat diets in persons with T2D, wherein drug dosing is one
of the primary study outcomes, are urgently needed. Moreover,
the clinical importance of personalized dietary interventions is a
major issue that requires evaluation in future studies. It is highly
unlikely that a “one size” solution fits all patients equally well.
Indeed, it has been shown that healthy people eating identical
meals present highly variable postmeal glucose responses (104).
This is probably also true in persons with T2D. Some studies
(105) suggest that the primary site of insulin resistance (liver,
muscle, adipose, or combinations thereof) dictates the optimal
diet composition for individuals with T2D.
Finally, because it appears that the key challenge with dietary
interventions is in ensuring their long-term adherence, future
studies should focus more on methods to sustain necessary
adaptations. This will require a comprehensive systems approach,
in which personal preferences, personality traits, socioeconomic
status, and family circumstances, in addition to personal aspects
of physiology, should be taken into account (106, 107).
