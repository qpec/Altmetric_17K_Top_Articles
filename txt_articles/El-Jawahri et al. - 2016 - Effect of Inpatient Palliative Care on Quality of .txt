Abstract
IMPORTANCE—During hospitalization for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), 
patients receive high-dose chemotherapy before transplantation and experience significant physical 
and psychological symptoms and poor quality of life (QOL).
OBJECTIVE—To assess the effect of inpatient palliative care on patient- and caregiver-reported 
outcomes during hospitalization for HCT and 3 months after transplantation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Nonblinded randomized clinical trial among 160 
adults with hematologic malignancies undergoing autologous/allogeneic HCT and their caregivers 
(n = 94). The study was conducted from August 2014 to January 2016 in a Boston hospital; 
follow-up was completed in May 2016.
INTERVENTIONS—Patients assigned to the intervention (n=81) were seen by palliative care 
clinicians at least twice a week during HCT hospitalization; the palliative intervention was focused

 on management of physical and psychological symptoms. Patients assigned to standard transplant 
care (n=79) could be seen by palliative care clinicians on request.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Primary: change in patient QOL from baseline to 
week 2; secondary: patient-assessed mood, fatigue, and symptom burden scores at baseline, 2 
weeks, and 3 months after HCT and caregiver-assessed QOL and mood at baseline and 2 weeks 
after HCT.
RESULTS—Among 160 patients (mean age, 60 [SD, 13.3] years;91 women [56.9%]; median 
hospital stay, 21 days) and 94 caregivers, 157 (98.1%) and 89 (94.7%), respectively, completed 2-
weekfollow-up, and 149 patients (93.1%) completed 3-monthfollow-up. Intervention patients 
reported a smaller decrease in QOL from baseline to week 2 vs controls. Intervention patients had 
less increase in depression, lower anxiety, no difference in fatigue, and less increase in symptom 
burden. At 3 months, intervention patients had higher QOL and less depression but no significant 
differences in anxiety, fatigue, or symptom burden. From baseline to week 2 after HCT, caregivers 
of intervention patients vs controls reported no significant differences in QOL or anxiety but had a 
smaller increase in depression (mean, 0.25 vs 1.80; mean difference, 1.55; 95%CI, 0.14–2.96; P 
= .03).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among adults at a single institution undergoing HCT 
for hematologic malignancy, the use of inpatient palliative care compared with standard transplant 
care resulted in a smaller decrease in QOL 2 weeks after transplantation. Further research is 
needed for replication and to assess longer-term outcomes and cost implications.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02207322
Patients with hematologic malignancies hospitalized for hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HCT) experience physical symptoms due to chemotherapy-induced toxic 
effects and early post transplantation complications.1–4 These symptoms, along with the 
physical isolation patients experience during the 3- to 4-week hospitalization, can contribute 
to a decline in their quality of life (QOL) and mood throughout their hospital stay.4–6 
Furthermore, the distress patients experience during transplantation often persists and has 
long-term QOL and psychological consequences, further exacerbating the morbidity of 
HCT.2,5,7 Despite the physical and psychological burden experienced by patients undergoing 
HCT, studies of interventions to improve their QOL and reduce their distress during HCT 
are limited.1,4,8–10 Clinicians often perceive patients’ physical and psychological symptoms 
during transplantation to be expected and unmodifiable.4,11 Although palliative care

 clinicians are increasingly asked to care for patients with solid tumors, they are infrequently 
consulted for patients with hematologic malignancies.12–14
This randomized clinical trial assessed the effect of inpatient palliative care integrated with 
standard transplant care on patient-reported QOL, mood, and symptom burden during 
hospitalization for HCT and at 3 months after HCT. The study also explored the effect of the 
intervention on caregivers’ QOL and mood during patients’ HCT hospitalization. The study 
hypotheses were that patients receiving the intervention would have a smaller decrease in 
their QOL and mood, lower symptom burden during their transplant hospitalization, and 
lower psychological distress at 3 months after HCT compared with patients receiving 
standard transplant care.
Methods
Study Procedures
This study was approved by the Dana Farber Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review 
Board and willing participants provided written informed consent (see trial protocol in 
Supplement 1). From August 12, 2014, to January 26, 2016, adult patients with hematologic 
malignancies admitted for autologous and allogeneic HCT at Massachusetts General 
Hospital and their caregivers were enrolled in a nonblinded randomized clinical trial of early 
palliative care integrated with standard transplant care vs standard transplant care alone. 
Consecutively eligible patients with planned autologous or allogeneic HCT were identified 
during the weekly transplant team meetings. Research staff obtained permission by email 
from the treating oncologist to approach eligible patients and their caregivers within 72 
hours of their transplant admission (HCT hospitalization). After providing informed consent, 
participants completed baseline study questionnaires. Patients were then randomized to the 
palliative care intervention or standard transplant care using a computer-generated 1:1 
randomization stratified by type of HCT (autologous, myeloablative allogeneic, or reduced-
intensity allogeneic HCT).
Participants
Patients aged 18 years or older who could speak English or complete questionnaires with 
minimal assistance from an interpreter were eligible to participate. Patients with a history of 
HCT or those with psychiatric or comorbid disease that the oncologist believed would 
interfere with adherence to study procedures were excluded. Enrolled patients were asked to 
identify a caregiver (a relative or a friend who either lived with the patient or had in-person 
contact with him/her at least twice per week) who could be invited to participate in the 
caregiver portion of this study. Patients without a caregiver were still eligible to participate.
Palliative Care Intervention
Intervention patients met with the inpatient palliative care physician or advanced practice 
nurse within 72 hours of randomization. The palliative care clinician followed patients up 
longitudinally during their hospitalization, seeing them at least twice per week. Patients, 
caregivers, and the palliative care clinicians were permitted to initiate additional visits as 
needed.

 Given the focus on the transplant hospitalization period, the palliative care intervention 
primarily focused on managing patients’ physical and psychological symptoms during 
hospitalization for HCT and did not include additional components of palliative care such as 
advance care planning, goals-of-care and code status discussions, or end-of-life decision 
making.
The palliative care intervention was developed based on a review of the literature, findings 
of prior preliminary work examining the experience of patients hospitalized for HCT,4 and 
input from 3 palliative care clinicians. Study investigators created an intervention manual 
(eAppendix in Supplement 2) that provided guidelines for addressing nausea, pain and 
mucositis, fatigue, insomnia, bowel problems, and psychological distress. Both 
pharmacological recommendations and behavioral interventions were included in the 
manual. The study manual did not mandate the timing of addressing each symptom because 
patients may experience symptoms at different points during their HCT. Palliative care 
clinicians documented the symptoms and topics addressed during each visit using Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). After each visit, the palliative care clinicians 
communicated their recommendations in person to the transplant team and documented their 
recommendations in the medical record. The palliative care visits were billed as part of the 
inpatient hospitalization bill to the patient’s insurance company.
Standard Transplant Care
Control patients received standard transplant care with the supportive care measures 
instituted by the transplant team. Patients, caregivers, and transplant clinicians were 
permitted to request consultation with palliative care clinicians.
Study Measures
Participants completed study questionnaires prior to randomization and during the second 
week of hospitalization for HCT (at patients’ blood count nadir; ie, the period during HCT 
hospitalization when patients experience the lowest blood cell counts and highest toxicity 
and symptom burden: day 5 after stem cell infusion for autologous and day 8 after stem cell 
infusion for allogeneic HCT, with a 2-day window) and at 3 and 6 months after HCT.
Patient-Reported Measures
To describe participants’ characteristics, patients self-reported their race, sex, relationship 
status, education, and income using fixed categories. The 47-itemFunctional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy–Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT; range, 0–164; higher scores 
represent better QOL), which includes subscales assessing physical, functional, emotional, 
social well-being, and bone marrow transplant–specific concerns during the past week, was 
used to assess patients’ QOL.15 A 5-point change in the FACT-BMT score is considered 
clinically significant.4,15 Fatigue was measured using the 13-item FACT Fatigue subscale 
(range, 0–52).16 Higher scores on both the FACT-BMT and the FACT Fatigue subscale 
indicate better QOL and lower fatigue.
Patients’ anxiety and depression were measured with the 14-itemHospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS), which consists of subscales assessing depression (HADS-D) and

 anxiety (HADS-A) symptoms in the past week, with scores ranging from 0 (no distress) to 
21 (maximum distress) and cutoff scores greater than 7 indicating clinically significant 
symptoms.17 Patients also completed the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; range, 0–
27), a 9-item measure that detects symptoms of major depressive disorder according to the 
criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) and 
can be evaluated continuously, with higher scores indicating worse depression.18
The revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) measures 10 symptoms on a 0- 
to 10-point scale, with higher scores indicating greatersymptomburden.19 Because of a 
clerical error, the first 38 study patients did not complete the nausea item, which was 
therefore omitted from the composite ESAS score analyses (range, 0–90).
Patients’ posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were measured at baseline and 3 
months after HCT using the PTSD Checklist–Civilian Version (range, 17–85). The PTSD 
Checklist is a 17-itemself-reportedmeasure that evaluates the severity of PTSD symptoms 
with higher scores indicating worse PTSD symptoms.
The study team reviewed patients’ electronic health records to obtain their cancer diagnosis, 
comorbidities, and date of transplantation. For each patient, the HCT Comorbidity Index20 
was calculated at the time of their transplant consultation.
Caregiver-Reported Measures
To describe caregiver characteristics, caregivers self-reported their age, sex, race, ethnicity, 
religion, education, and relationship to the patient using fixed categories. The Care Giver 
Oncology QOL questionnaire (range, 0–116), a 29-item instrument that measures 10 QOL 
domains and can be analyzed by domain or using a composite score, was used 
tomeasureQOL.21 Caregivers also completed the HADS andPHQ-9. Caregiver outcomes 
were obtained only at baseline and week 2.
Study Outcomes
Primary End Point—The primary study end point was the comparison between study 
groups of the change in patient QOL, as measured by the FACT-BMT, from baseline to week 
2 of hospitalization for HCT.
Secondary End Points—Of 26 prespecified secondary outcomes, 13 were analyzed for 
this study. Secondary study end points reported herein include changes in patient mood 
(depression and anxiety, as measured with the HADS and PHQ-9), fatigue (FACT Fatigue 
subscale), symptom burden (ESAS), and caregiver QOL and mood (HADS and PHQ-9) 
from baseline to week 2 of HCT hospitalization, as well as a comparison of patient-reported 
QOL, mood, fatigue, symptom burden, and PTSD between the 2 study groups 3 months after 
HCT. Additional secondary end points included in the protocol that will be reported 
separately include comparison of patient distress using the National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network Distress Thermometer Checklist, patient-reported outcomes (QOL, mood, fatigue, 
symptom burden, and PTSD) 6 months after HCT, incidence of acute and chronic graft-vs-
host disease, and nonrelapse mortality and overall survival.

 Statistical Analysis
Participants’ baseline characteristics between randomized groups were summarized using 
frequency and percentage for categorical variables and means and standard deviations for 
continuous variables. The primary study end point was the comparison of the change in 
FACT-BMT score during hospitalization from baseline to week 2 between study groups 
using a 2-sample t test. The second week of hospitalization was chosen for the primary end 
point of the study because this is the most symptomatic phase of the transplant 
hospitalization.4 The secondary outcomes, including changes inpatients’ depression, anxiety, 
fatigue, and symptom burden, were also compared from baseline to week 2 between study 
groups using a 2-sample t test. The same statistical approach was used to examine changes 
in caregiver-reported outcomes. The HADS subscale scores were dichotomized as described 
above to compare frequencies of depression and anxiety symptoms between the 2 study 
groups at week 2 and 3 months after HCT using the Fisher exact test.
Separate exploratory post hoc analyses of covariance were conducted to compare changes in 
all patient-reported outcomes from baseline to week 2 and 3 months after HCT, adjusting for 
baseline outcome scores between the 2 study groups. In addition to complete case analyses, 
multiple imputations were used for missing observations as prespecified in the study 
protocol. The multiple imputation approach used baseline characteristics (age, sex, 
education, transplant type, HCT comorbidity index, and performance status) to build a 
regression model to impute missing outcomes data with 100 imputations. Mixed linear-
effects models adjusting for baseline scores were also used on the imputed data set to assess 
the intervention effect on patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes at week 2 and 3 months 
after HCT. Transplant type (autologous vs allogeneic) was assessed as a potential moderator 
of the effect of the intervention using interaction terms that were added to the models.
A sample size of 160 patients (80 patients in each group) was estimated to be sufficient with 
80% power to detect a 6-point change in QOL (FACT-BMT) from baseline to week 2 using 
a 2-sample t test with an α=.05 statistical significance level and a rate of attrition of 15%. 
All reported P values are 2-sidedwithP < .05 considered statistically significant. Analyses 
did not adjust for multiple comparisons; thus, all secondary end point analyses are 
exploratory. All data analyses were conducted using Stata version 9.3.
Results
Patient Participants
A total of 242 patients were screened for eligibility (Figure 1). One hundred eighty-six 
eligible patients were approached and 160 (86%) were enrolled in the study. Enrolled 
patients were mostly white (n = 139 [86.9%]), with a mean age of 57.1 (SD, 13.3) years; 
56.9%(n = 91) were female and 50%(n = 80)were undergoing allogeneic HCT (Table 1). 
There were no meaningful differences in clinical characteristics between study groups, 
including baseline measures on the FACT-BMT, HADS, PHQ-9, FACT Fatigue, ESAS, and 
PTSD Checklist. Three patients (1.9%) and 11 patients (6.9%) had missing data at 2 weeks 
and 3 months after HCT, respectively.

 Palliative Care Visits
The median durations of HCT hospitalization for the intervention and control groups were 
20 (range, 12–102) days and 21 (range, 13–40) days, respectively. All intervention patients 
had at least 2 palliative care visits during the first 2 weeks of their hospitalization (median 
number of visits, 4; range, 2–7). Intervention participants had at least 4 palliative care visits 
during their entire hospitalization (median number of visits, 8; range, 4–40). Two control 
patients received a palliative care consultation. Table 2 depicts the most commonly 
addressed symptoms and topics during the palliative care visits. A total of 41.8%(146/349) 
of palliative care visits occurred while a family member was present. The mean duration of 
the initial palliative care consultation visit was 59.2 (SD, 8.8) minutes, and clinicians 
reported spending a mean time of 60.2 (SD, 33.3) minutes per week on subsequent visits.
Primary Outcome
Figure 2A depicts changes in patient QOL across all time points. Intervention patients 
reported a lower decrease in QOL from baseline to week 2 vs control patients (intervention: 
mean baseline FACT-BMT score, 110.26; week 2 score, 95.46, mean change, −14.72; 
control: mean baseline score, 106.83; week 2 score, 85.42; mean change, −21.54; difference 
between groups, −6.82;95% CI, −13.48 to −0.16; P = .045).
Secondary Outcomes
As shown in Figure 2B, patients in the intervention group, compared with patients in the 
control group, had lower mean depression scores at 2 weeks on the HADS-D (intervention: 
baseline score, 3.95; week 2 score, 6.39; mean change, 2.43; control: baseline score, 4.94; 
week 2 score, 8.86; mean change, 3.92; difference between groups, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.20–
2.78; P = .02) as well as at 3 months.
As shown in Figure 2C, patients in the intervention group reported a decrease in anxiety 
symptoms, whereas control patients reported an increase in anxiety symptoms from baseline 
to week 2 on the HADS-A (intervention: mean baseline score, 4.64; mean week 2 score, 
3.87; mean change, −0.80; control: mean baseline score, 5.39; mean week 2 score, 6.55; 
mean change, 1.12; difference between groups, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.83–3.01; P < .001) but no 
significant difference at 3 months. During week 2, intervention patients were less likely to 
have clinically significant depression symptoms on the HADS-D (30.0% vs 59.7% among 
controls; P < .001) and anxiety symptoms on the HADS-A (10.0% vs 41.6% among 
controls; P < .001), but there were no significant differences in PHQ-9 scores (intervention: 
mean baseline score, 4.75; mean week 2 score, 8.03; mean change, 3.24; control: mean 
baseline score, 5.40; mean week 2 score, 9.75; mean change, 4.35; difference between 
groups, 1.11; 95% CI, −0.47 to 2.70; P = .17).
There were no significant differences between the groups in reported fatigue at 2 weeks 
(intervention: mean baseline score, 38.14; mean week 2 score, 27.93; mean change, −10.30; 
control: mean baseline score, 36.89; mean week 2 score, 23.35; mean change, −13.65; 
difference between groups, −3.35; 95% CI, −7.25 to 0.56; P = .09) or at 3 months.

 Patients in the intervention group, compared with patients in the control group, reported 
lower increases in symptom burden (intervention: mean baseline score, 13.68; mean week 2 
score, 30.31; mean change, 17.35; control: mean baseline score, 15.15; mean week 2 score, 
38.29; mean change, 23.14; difference between groups, 5.80; 95% CI, 0.49–11.10; P = .03) 
from baseline to week 2 (Figure 2D). There was no significant difference at 3 months.
In models adjusting for baseline scores, intervention assignment was significantly associated 
with patient-reported QOL, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and symptom burden at week 2 
after HCT (Table 3). Moreover, after adjusting for baseline scores, intervention assignment 
was significantly associated with patient-reported QOL, depression, and PTSD but was not 
significantly associated with anxiety, fatigue, or symptom burden at 3 months after HCT 
(Table 3). At 3 months after HCT, intervention patients were less likely to have clinically 
significant depression symptoms (9.5%vs 28.4%; P = .006) but had no difference in anxiety. 
Similar results were obtained with mixed linear-effects models adjusting for baseline scores 
with multiple imputations to examine the intervention effect at both time points (eTable 1 in 
Supplement 2). The effect of the intervention did not differ by transplant type (no significant 
interaction involving intervention and transplant type).
Caregiver Outcomes
Among the 160 enrolled patients, 94 had caregivers who were randomized as part of a 
patient-caregiver dyad to the intervention group (n = 49) or control group (n = 45), 18 
patients did not identify a caregiver whom they were willing to have research staff approach 
for study participation, 37 caregivers were unable to be reached, and 11 refused to 
participate. Baseline caregiver characteristics were well balanced between the study groups 
(Table 4). The majority of caregivers were the patient’s spouse (n = 76 [80.9%]). Only 5 
caregivers (5.3%) had missing data at week 2.
From baseline to week 2, there were no significant differences between caregivers of 
patients assigned to the intervention group and caregivers of patients assigned to the control 
group in overall QOL (intervention: mean baseline score, 118.81; mean week 2 score, 
118.72; mean change, −0.58; control: mean baseline score, 116.85; mean week 2 score, 
113.32; mean change, −3.56; difference between groups, −2.98; 95%CI, −7.96 to 1.99; P = .
24). Caregivers of intervention patients vs those of controls reported less increase in 
depression symptoms from baseline to week 2 on the HADS-D (intervention: mean baseline 
score, 3.98; mean week 2 score, 4.05; mean change, 0.25; control: mean baseline score, 
4.30; mean week 2 score,6.00; mean change, 1.80; difference between groups, 1.55; 95% CI, 
0.14–2.96; P = .03).
There were no significant differences in caregivers’ anxiety from baseline to week 2 between 
the study groups on the HADS-A(intervention: mean baseline score, 6.90; mean week 2 
score, 6.24; mean change, −0.67; control: mean baseline score, 7.24; mean week 2 score, 
6.55; mean change, −0.62; difference between groups, 0.05; 95%CI, −1.38 to 0.10; P = .95). 
There were also no significant differences in depression as measured by the PHQ-9 from 
baseline to week 2 between the study groups (intervention: mean baseline score, 3.84; mean 
week 2 score, 4.51; mean change,0.84; control:mean baseline score, 4.22; mean week 2 
score, 4.96; mean change, 0.84; difference between groups, 0.01; 95% CI, −1.44 to 1.45; P

 = .99). Similar results were obtained for caregiver outcomes at week 2 using multiple 
imputations (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
However, caregivers of patients in the intervention group, vs caregivers of patients in the 
control group, reported improvement in coping (intervention: mean baseline score, 12.28; 
mean week 2 score, 12.70; mean change, 0.23; control: mean baseline score, 12.18; mean 
week 2 score, 11.59; mean change, −0.74; difference between groups, −0.97; 95% CI, −1.79 
to −0.15; P = .02) and improvement in administrative and financial domains of 
QOL(intervention: mean baseline score, 13.02; mean week 2 score, 13.22; mean change, 
0.24; control: mean baseline score, 13.23; mean week 2 score, 12.71; mean change, −0.46; 
difference between groups, −0.70; 95% CI, −1.31 to −0.09; P = .02) from baseline to week 
2.
Discussion
In this study of patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HCT, involvement of 
palliative care compared with standard transplant care led to a lower decrease in QOL at 
week 2 of hospitalization for HCT, the primary outcome. Because a 5-point change in the 
FACT-BMT score is considered clinically important,4,15 the intervention led to a clinically 
meaningful difference in QOL compared with standard transplant care. In addition, 
exploratory secondary outcomes also showed that patients in the palliative care group 
benefited, with less increase in their depression symptoms, lower anxiety symptoms, and 
less increase in symptom burden compared with those receiving standard transplant care. 
Thus, palliative care may help to lessen the decline in QOL experienced by patients during 
hospitalization for HCT, which has long been perceived as a natural aspect of the 
transplantation process.1,4,11
To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effect of a palliative care intervention 
for patients receiving potentially curative therapy, specifically those with hematologic 
malignancies hospitalized for HCT. Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated that 
concurrent palliative and oncology care leads to improvement in QOL and symptom burden 
in patients with advanced cancer.22–26 However, these findings have not affected the care of 
patients with hematologic malignancies, in part because of the lack of evidence supporting 
the benefits of palliative care in this population.27 In the present study, only 2 patients 
randomized to receive standard transplant care received a palliative care consultation, 
illustrating the infrequent use of palliative care in this population. This study also suggests 
that the benefits of palliative care may extend beyond patients with solid tumors. 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a highly specialized procedure only offered at 
large academic hospitals and comprehensive cancer centers, which often have inpatient 
palliative care services. Thus, access to inpatient palliative care services should be available 
for the majority of patients undergoing HCT.
This is also the first trial to our knowledge of a palliative care intervention that demonstrates 
reduction in patient anxiety at week 2 following HCT.22,23,25,26 Palliative care clinicians 
frequently focused on coping and managing expectations, which likely explains the 
improvement in psychological outcomes, including anxiety. The effects of the intervention

 were sustained, with better QOL and lower depression and PTSD symptoms at 3 months 
after HCT, although the improvements in fatigue, symptom burden, and anxiety observed at 
2 weeks were no longer significant at 3 months. Prior work has suggested that the extent of 
decline in QOL and increase in depression symptoms during patients’ hospitalization for 
HCT are associated with their QOL and PTSD symptoms up to 6 months after 
transplantation.7 Future work should examine the effect of integrating palliative care on 
longer-term patient outcomes, as well as health care utilization and end-of-life outcomes, 
given the high risk of morbidity and mortality in this population.1,28,29
This work also demonstrates that a palliative care intervention targeted to the needs of 
patients can affect their caregivers’ outcomes. Although this study was underpowered to 
examine caregiver outcomes, the palliative care intervention led to improvements in 
caregivers’ coping and depression symptoms at 2 weeks but no significant improvement in 
caregivers’ QOL or anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest that modifying patients’ 
experience during HCT may have some positive effects on some aspects of caregivers’ well-
being. Future studies should be adequately powered to better assess the effect of palliative 
care involvement on caregiver outcomes, given the critical role that caregivers play in 
providing care and support for this population.
This study has several important limitations. First, the investigation was performed at a 
single tertiary care site with a specialized group of transplant and palliative care clinicians, 
and the patient population lacked racial and ethnic diversity, potentially limiting the 
generalizability of the results to other care settings or transplant centers with different 
practices. Second, patients and clinicians could not be blinded to the intervention, which 
may have introduced bias. The lack of blinding is particularly relevant because all outcome 
measures were participant reported. Involvement of palliative care in the care of patients 
randomized to the intervention on the same transplant floor may have altered clinicians’ 
behaviors in the control group, which may have diluted the study findings.
Third, numerous secondary outcomes were assessed without adjustment for multiple 
comparisons and therefore should be considered exploratory findings. Fourth, the 
intervention only entailed visits by a palliative care physician or advanced nurse practitioner 
and did not include other members of the palliative care team such as social workers, 
psychologists, or chaplains.
Fifth, data on the cost of the palliative care intervention were not collected. Future work 
should include an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the palliative care intervention in 
this population. Sixth, an attention-control placebo group was not used in this study and, 
thus, it is unclear to what extent participants’ outcomes were are affected by the amount of 
time spent with a supportive individual as opposed to a clinician with palliative care 
expertise. Given the potential limitations in generalizability and uncertainty about cost-
effectiveness, additional research (including replication) is needed before recommendation 
about dissemination can be made.

 Conclusions
Among adults at a single institution undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancies, the use 
of inpatient palliative care compared with standard transplant care resulted in a smaller 
decrease in QOL after week 2 of the transplant hospitalization. Further research is needed to 
replicate these findings and assess the long-term outcomes and cost implications.

 Key Points
Question
What is the effect of an inpatient palliative care intervention on the quality of life of 
patients with hematologic malignancies during hospitalization for hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HCT)?
Findings
In this randomized clinical trial of 160 adults, patients assigned to an inpatient palliative 
care intervention reported a 14.72-point decrease in their quality of life from the time of 
admission for HCT to week 2 of hospitalization compared with a 21.54-point decrease in 
quality of life for patients assigned to transplant care alone, a statistically significant 
difference.
Meaning
Among patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing HCT, involvement of 
palliative care, compared with transplant care alone, led to a smaller decrease in quality 
of life at 2 weeks after transplantation.
