We evaluated the relationships of red meat, poultry, fish, and shellfish intakes, as well as heme iron intake, with the
risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).The Singapore Chinese Health Study is a population-based cohort study that re-
cruited 63,257 Chinese adults aged 45–74 years from 1993 to 1998. Usual diet was evaluated using a validated 165-
item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire at recruitment. Physician-diagnosed T2D was self-reported during
2 follow-up interviews in 1999–2004 and 2006–2010. During a mean follow-up of 10.9 years, 5,207 incident cases of
T2D were reported. When comparing persons in the highest intake quartiles with those in the lowest, the multivariate-
adjusted hazard ratio for T2D was 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 1.33) for red meat intake (P for trend < 0.001),
1.15 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.24) for poultry intake (P for trend = 0.004), and 1.07 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.16) for fish/shellfish intake
(P for trend = 0.12). After additional adjustment for heme iron, only red meat intake remained significantly associated
with T2D risk (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.25; P for trend = 0.02). Heme iron was associ-
ated with a higher risk of T2D even after additional adjustment for red meat intake (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio =
1.14, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.28; P for trend = 0.03). In conclusion, red meat and poultry intakes were associated with a higher
risk of T2D. These associations were mediated completely for poultry and partially for red meat by heme iron intake.

Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; T2D, type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Although prospective human studies have consistently
shown that a diet rich in processed red meat is associated
with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) (1–3),
the association has been less consistent for unprocessed red
meat (3–7). In a meta-analysis of 9 prospective studies, Pan
et al. (3) showed an association with unprocessed red meat
that was direct but had a large degree of heterogeneity, and the
only Chinese study included in the meta-analysis reported a
null association (8). Furthermore, whether higher intakes of
poultry or fish/shellfish are associated with T2D risk remains
controversial; some meta-analyses indicated null associations
(7, 9, 10), whereas studies in Chinese populations reported
inverse associations (8, 11).
Heterogeneous findings when comparing Chinese popula-
tions with Western populations may be attributed to differences
in the absolute intakes and the types of red meat (pork vs. beef)
consumed (8, 11, 12). However, few studies have been
conducted on the associations of T2D with red meat (8, 13),
poultry (8, 13), and fish/shellfish (11) intakes in Asian
populations.
Moreover, prospective human studies have consistently
shown a positive association between dietary heme iron intake
and T2D risk (14), but the question of whether only heme iron
intake from red meat increases the risk of diabetes or if heme
iron intake from other types of meat could have the same del-
eterious impact remains unanswered (15), given that poultry
and fish/shellfish also contain heme iron (16).
Therefore, in the present large cohort study of middle-
aged and elderly Chinese people in Singapore, we examined
the relationships of dietary intakes of red meat, poultry, and
fish/shellfish with the risk of incident T2D. Moreover, we as-
sessed the association of total heme iron intake with T2D

 risk and whether heme iron intake mediated the meat con-
sumption–T2D associations.
METHODS
Study population
The Singapore Chinese Health Study is a population-based
cohort study established between April 1993 and December
1998 in which investigators recruited 35,303 Chinese women
and 27,954 Chinese men aged 45–74 years (17). The participants
were descendants from southern China, either from the Fujian
province, where the Hokkien dialect is spoken, or from the
Guangdong province, where the Cantonese dialect is spoken; both
are major dialects common among Chinese in Singapore. Briefly,
all participants were interviewed in person using structured
questionnaires at recruitment. Surviving participants received
a follow-up via telephone call at follow-up I (1999–2004) and
follow-up II (2006–2010). The institutional review board at
the National University of Singapore approved the study, and
informed consent was obtained from all the study subjects.
Assessment of diet and covariates
Information on usual diet for the past year was collected
using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire that
included 165 food items commonly consumed by this popula-
tion during the baseline interview. The food frequency question-
naire was subsequently validated in a subset of 810 participants
by performing a repeat administration, as well as by compar-
ing two 24-hour recalls (17). The validation study using these
2 methods showed similar distributions, with most mean pairs
for energy and nutrients within 10% of each other’s values.
For energy and nutrients, the coefficients for the correlations
between these 2 methods ranged between 0.24 and 0.79, values
that are comparable to those from previous validation studies in
diverse populations (18). Red meat, poultry, and fish/shellfish
were among the main sources of protein and fat in this popula-
tion. Although correlation coefficients were not specifically
calculated for poultry, red meat, and fish/shellfish intake, the
coefficients for the correlations between these 2 methods
ranged from 0.36 to 0.61 for protein intake and from 0.34 to
0.47 for fat intake (17). For dietary intake, the respondents
were required to select from 8 categories, ranging from “never
or hardly ever” to “2 or more times a day,” and from 3 portion
sizes (small, medium, or large) with the actual plate/bowl and
photographs of food on the same plate/bowl provided as a
guide. We separately assessed intakes (in grams) of red meat
(8 items), poultry (7 items), fish/shellfish (6 items), and pre-
served or processed meat foods (12 items) using 33 items
that included these foods (see Web Appendix 1, available
at https://academic.oup.com/aje). We further assessed heme
iron and nonheme iron intakes (in milligrams) from the
Singapore Food Composition Database developed specifi-
cally for this cohort (17). We also collected self-reported
information about each subject’s age, body weight, height,
educational level, alcohol consumption, smoking status, phys-
ical activity level, and known medical conditions at recruit-
ment. Body mass index was calculated as body weight in
kilograms divided by square of height in meters.
Assessment of T2D
We asked participants about any history of physician-
diagnosed T2D at recruitment and the 2 follow-up interviews
by using the question, “Have you been told by a doctor that
you have diabetes (high blood sugar)?” If they answered yes,
we followed with, “Please also tell me the age at which you
were first diagnosed.” Using standard protocols, we validated
the accuracy (at 98.8%) of self-reported diabetes in this cohort
in a separate study of 1,651 cohort subjects who self-reported
a history of physician-diagnosed T2D at follow-up I (19).
Participants with a history of diagnosed T2D at recruitment
were excluded from the analysis. Individuals were considered
to have incident cases of T2D if they reported being diag-
nosed anytime between recruitment and the subsequent follow-
up interviews.
Statistical analysis
Of 54,341 participants that were contacted in at least 1
follow-up, a total of 45,411 subjects were eligible for the cur-
rent analysis (Web Figure 1). We used Cox proportional ha-
zards models to examine associations between quartiles of
meat intake (red meat, poultry, and fish/shellfish) and T2D
risk using the lowest quartile intake as the reference cate-
gory. We adjusted food and nutrient intakes for energy intake
by using the residual method (20). We calculated person-years
for each participant from the date of recruitment until the reported
time of T2D diagnosis or the date of last follow-up interview,
whichever came first. In the multivariable model, we adjusted
for age (continuous), sex, interview year (1993–1995 or 1996–
1998), dialect group (Hokkien or Cantonese), level of education
(none, primary school, or secondary school or more), physical
activity level (<0.5, 0.5–3.9, or ≥4.0 hours/week), body mass
index (continuous), cigarette smoking status (never smoker, for-
mer smoker, or current smoker), alcohol consumption (never or
monthly, weekly, or daily), baseline history of hypertension, total
energy intake (continuous), and quartiles of scores indicating
adherence to the “vegetable-, fruit-, and soy-rich pattern,” which
is a dietary pattern previously identified through principal com-
ponent analysis and has been shown to be associated with the
risk of T2D in this cohort (21). In sensitivity analyses for each
meat type, we also adjusted for dietary intakes of eggs, soy, non-
soy legumes, vegetables, fruits and related juice, noodles,
rice, nuts and seeds, coffee (all in quartiles), soda (glasses per
week, continuous), and the 2 other meat types. We included
heme iron intake (quartiles) as a covariate in the final model.
We tested the proportionality assumption using Schoenfeld
residuals, and no violation was seen. We tested P values for lin-
ear trend by including median intakes of quartiles as continu-
ous variables in models. We also stratified the analyses by sex
using sex-specific quartiles. We tested potential interactions
using a likelihood ratio test of the cross-product terms for the
associations of median intake quartiles and sex, age (catego-
rized based on cohort median of 54 years at recruitment),
and body mass index (<23 or ≥23). Moreover, we evaluated
the effects of substituting 1 serving of meat with other
types of meat (red meat, poultry, and fish/shellfish) using
the method described by Kulldorff et al. (22). To facilitate the
substitution analysis, we further defined 1 serving as 50 grams

 red meat, fish/shellfish, or poultry, which is the serving size
(“liang”) widely used in Chinese populations (23). Accordingly,
we simultaneously included 2 types of meat as continuous
variables (serving) in the multivariate Cox model. We calcu-
lated the hazard ratio for substitution by using the exponential
of the difference between the 2 coefficients, and we used the
covariance between them to derive corresponding standard
errors and 95% confidence intervals. We also modeled heme
iron intake using a restricted cubic spline with 4 knots to test
the linearity in multivariate-adjusted Cox regression analyses
for men and women separately. Using the second knot as a
referent, we calculated corresponding hazard ratios for heme
iron values in each model. For mediation analysis, we used
the method described by Buis et al. (24) to decompose a total
association between quartiles of meat intake and T2D risk
into direct and indirect associations (with heme iron intake as
a continuous mediator) using a bootstrapping method to cal-
culate the standard errors.
All the statistical analyses were conducted using Stata sta-
tistical software, release 11.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station,
Texas). A 2-sided P value less than 0.05 was the threshold for
statistical significance.
RESULTS
Participants had a mean age of 55.2 (standard deviation,
7.6) years at recruitment, and 57.3% were women. The base-
line characteristics of participants in the first and fourth quar-
tiles of meat intakes are shown in Table 1. Participants in the
highest quartiles of poultry and fish/shellfish intakes were
more likely to be women but less likely to be smokers com-
pared with those with low intakes. Participants in the highest
quartile of poultry intake also had a substantially higher edu-
cation level. The median intake of total meat in this popula-
tion was 97.4 g/day (interquartile range: 67.9–135 g/day); on
average, intake comprised 27.9% red meat, 18.6% poultry,
and 53.3% fish/shellfish. The majority of red meat consumed
was in the form of fresh meat (87.1%), whereas organ and
preserved red meat accounted for 3.6% and 8.5% of total red
meat intake, respectively. The energy-adjusted intakes of red
meat, poultry, and fish/shellfish were similar in men and
women. The pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients for the
intakes of different types of meat (grams per day) were 0.28
for red meat and poultry, 0.21 for red meat and fish/shellfish,
and 0.10 for poultry and fish/shellfish.
During a mean follow-up of 10.9 years (494,741 person-
years), we identified 5,207 incident cases of T2D. Table 2 and
Web Table 1 present associations between different types of
meat intake and T2D risk. After adjustment for potential con-
founders including dietary pattern, both red meat and poultry
intakes showed positive associations with T2D risk. In the
sensitivity analyses, we also adjusted these associations for
individual food items, including the 2 other meat types, but
risk estimates were not materially changed. The hazard ratios
for the comparison of extreme quartiles were 1.21 (95% confi-
dence interval (CI): 1.11, 1.32; P for trend < 0.001) for red
meat, 1.10 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.20; P for trend = 0.03) for poul-
try, and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.10; P for trend = 0.79) for fish/
shellfish. After additional adjustment for heme iron intake, the
association between red meat intake and T2D risk was substan-
tially attenuated but remained statistically significant, whereas
the association with poultry intake disappeared. In the sensi-
tivity analyses, the association was similar for fresh red meat
intake, whereas we found only a weaker, marginally signifi-
cant association with processed red meat intake, probably
because of the very low consumption level. Intake of red organ
meat had significant positive association with risk of T2D (haz-
ard ratio = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.21; P for trend = 0.02) but not
after additional adjustment for heme iron intake (hazard ratio =
1.02, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.12; P for trend = 0.90; Web Table 2).
Next, for risk of incident T2D, we evaluated the changes
in hazard ratio that resulted from substituting 1 serving of a
specific type of meat with the other types (red meat, poultry,
and fish/shellfish) (Figure 1). We found that replacing 1 daily
serving of red meat with fish/shellfish was significantly asso-
ciated with a 26% (95% CI: 9, 40) lower risk. Replacement
of 1 daily serving of poultry with fish/shellfish was also associ-
ated with a 22% (95% CI: 3, 36) lower risk. However, substitu-
tion of poultry for red meat was not significantly associated
with a change in T2D risk.
Compared with a heme iron intake in the lowest quartile,
intakes in higher quartiles were associated with higher T2D
risk in a dose-response manner (Table 3 and Web Table 3).
This association remained statistically significant after further
adjustment for other lifestyle and dietary factors and remained
unchanged with additional adjustment for poultry and fish/
shellfish intakes. However, it was attenuated with further adjust-
ment for red meat. No significant association was observed
between intake of nonheme iron and T2D risk.
We further noticed that the association of T2D risk with
red meat intake was attenuated after adjustment for heme iron
intake in women but not in men, although the interaction
between sex and red meat intake did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (P for interaction = 0.13). As for mediation analysis,
when comparing extreme quartiles, we found that red meat
intake was associated with T2D risk either directly (P = 0.035)
or indirectly through heme iron intake, with a 43.3% of total
effect mediated (P = 0.026). The association with poultry
intake was substantially mediated by heme iron intake
(mediation proportion = 89.4%). There was no significant
difference in the associations with poultry and fish/shellfish
between men and women; the P values for interaction were
0.17 and 0.70, respectively (Web Table 4). We did not find
any significant interaction between meat types and age or
body mass index either. However, we found that the associa-
tion between heme iron intake and T2D risk was stronger in
women (for extreme quartiles, hazard ratio = 1.33, 95% CI:
1.18, 1.49; P for trend < 0.001) than men (for extreme quar-
tiles, hazard ratio = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.31; P for trend =
0.09) (P for interaction = 0.008; Web Table 5). Restricted
cubic analysis showed a linear association between heme
iron intake and T2D risk in both men (P for nonlinearity = 0.09)
and women (P for nonlinearity = 0.78; Figure 2).

In the present large-scale cohort of middle-aged and elderly
Chinese persons, we found positive associations between

 intakes of red meat and poultry and risk of T2D. Further-
more, we also found that substitution with fish/shellfish
could reduce the risk of T2D associated with red meat and
poultry intakes. The association with poultry seemed to be
mediated via its heme iron content, whereas the association
with red meat was only partially explained by its heme iron
content. Heme iron intake was positively associated with
T2D risk, with a stronger association in women than in men.
Various studies had consistently shown a positive associa-
tion between processed red meat intake and risk of developing
T2D (1–3), whereas the relationship of unprocessed red meat
intake with T2D risk has been less consistent (3–7). In a meta-
analysis that included 9 prospective studies (8 conducted in
Western populations and 1 in a Chinese population), investi-
gators reported a pooled fully adjusted relative risk of 1.19
(95% CI: 1.04, 1.37) per 100 g/day of unprocessed red meat
intake, although there was great heterogeneity (I2 = 93.3%)
(3). In the only study in Chinese populations, researchers com-
pared median intakes of 67.6 g/day versus 24.5 g/day and re-
ported a null association (relative risk = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.79,
1.12) (8). The authors hypothesized that this might have been
due to the low amount and different type of red meat (90%
pork) consumed among the participants of the study based in
China (8). However, we found a positive association with red
meat intake in our study population, who seemed to consume
quantities and type of red meat similar to what was seen in the
study from China. We found similar strengths of associa-
tion between red meat intake and T2D risk in both men and
women; however, the association in women but not in men
was attenuated after adjustment for heme iron. In another
large cohort study in Japanese adults, investigators found that
red meat intake was associated with a higher risk of T2D in
men but not in women (13).
As for poultry intake, results in the previous literature show a
mix of inverse (8), null (7, 13), and positive (7) associations
with T2D risk. In contrast to our findings, those from a recent
meta-analysis that included 10 prospective studies from Europe
showed a pooled relative risk of 1.04 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.32) (25),
and 2 additional studies from China and Japan found inverse
(8) and null associations (13), respectively. To the best of our
knowledge, a harmful association has only been reported in 2
studies in European populations, but neither of them has evalu-
ated the association with heme iron (7). In the present study, the
positive association with poultry was attenuated and not statisti-
cally significant after adjustment for heme iron intake, indicating
the possible role of heme iron as a mediator of the association
between poultry and T2D development. Interestingly, heme
iron contents differ in different parts of poultry; for example,
chicken thighs contain 5 μg/g of heme iron, whereas chicken
breasts contain approximately 2 μg/g of heme iron (16). Hence,
1 potential explanation for the inconsistency in the evidence of
an association between poultry and T2D risk in different popu-
lations might be differences in preferences for different parts of
poultry.
Investigators in a previous meta-analyses showed that the
effect of fish/shellfish intake may be modified by study loca-
tion (9, 10). In 1 meta-analysis, researchers showed a higher
risk among participants in studies conducted in the United
States, null association among European populations, and
an inverse association among Asian and Australian popula-
tions (10). In a recent analysis in 8 European countries under-
taken by the InterAct Consortium of the European Prospective

 Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition, no significant asso-
ciation was found between total fish/shellfish consumption
and T2D risk (26). Another meta-analysis similarly showed
a null association in Western population but a protective
association in populations in Asian studies (9). However, the
2 Asian studies in the meta-analyses have reported inconsis-
tent results themselves; Villegas et al. (11) reported a signifi-
cant inverse association in Chinese women but not in men,
whereas Nanri et al. (27) reported a significant inverse asso-
ciation in Japanese men but not in women. We did not find
any significant association between fish/shellfish consumption
and T2D risk in this Chinese population. However, the substi-
tution analysis showed that fish could be a beneficial alterna-
tive to red meat and poultry.
We found that intake of heme iron but not nonheme iron
was associated with T2D risk, and this was consistent with
findings from previous studies (14, 28). In a meta-analysis of
5 prospective studies in which median intakes of 2.39 mg/day
and 0.56 mg/day were compared, the pooled relative risk was
1.33 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.48), with a low degree of heterogeneity
(I2 = 27.4) (14). Iron is a strong pro-oxidant that catalyzes the
production of reactive oxygen species, which may damage
body tissues, particularly insulin-producing pancreatic cells
(29). Several prospective human studies have shown a posi-
tive association between body iron store and higher T2D risk
(30). The distinct effects of heme iron and nonheme iron
intake on T2D risk may be explained by the differences in bio-
availability and their effects on body iron stores, because
heme iron is more readily absorbed than nonheme iron (14).
In line with our findings, researchers conducing a pooled
analysis of data from the Health Professionals Follow-Up
Study and Nurses’ Health Studies I and II found that the associ-
ation between red meat consumption and T2D was attenuated
largely by further adjustment for heme iron, although it was
still positive (3). These findings indicate that the association of

 T2D with red meat is only partly mediated through the heme
iron content of the latter and that other components in red
meat, such as advanced glycation end products and trimethyla-
mine N-oxide, also have strong mechanistic links to insulin
resistance (31). Red meat intake may also be linked to T2D
risk via the promotion of inflammation (4, 32). Altogether,
these pathways explain the residual association of red meat
that is independent of heme iron.
We reported a stronger association of dietary heme iron with
T2D risk in women. Most previous studies on the heme iron–
T2D risk association included single sex (14) or did not provide
stratified analysis (28). There has been only 1 study in a Chinese
population in which researchers evaluated sex-specific associa-
tions, but contrary to our findings, they reported a stronger asso-
ciation in men based on a limited number of events (n = 131)
(33). The observed sex difference in our study may be due to
heterogeneity in iron absorption regulated by intestinal mucosa.
Evidence has shown that women, who have generally greater
requirements for iron, absorb approximately twice as much iron
as men from the same dietary intake (34). Nevertheless, more
studies are still needed to confirm sex difference in the associa-
tion between heme iron and T2D risk and to explore the poten-
tial mechanisms.
The strengths of our study include the large sample size, long
follow-up period, high response and follow-up rates, and
detailed collection of data through face-to-face interviews using
a food frequency questionnaire that was specifically developed
and validated in this population (17). Furthermore, we con-
trolled for a number of dietary and nondietary covariates to
reduce the confounding effects, although unmeasured and
residual confounding are still possible in epidemiologic
studies. However, our findings have some limitations. First,
self-report of meat intake could result in nondifferential mis-
classification because of measurement errors. Because such
nondifferential misclassification for a dichotomous exposure
could lead to bias toward the null value (35), we tested binary
meat intake variables (based on median) and consistently
found significantly higher risks of T2D associated with higher
intakes of red meat, poultry, and heme iron (data not shown),
which suggests that any nondifferential misclassification
would have likely led to an underestimation of the actual risk
estimate. Second, diet was only assessed at baseline, and we
lack information about potential changes in exposure that
occurred later. Third, we only inquired about physician-
diagnosed T2D in our study, and it is expected that asymptom-
atic diabetes existed in the study population. We do not perceive
any reason for meat intake to be related to the likelihood of dis-
ease diagnosis in our study population. Hence, we believe that
such misclassification of diagnosis for asymptomatic diabetes
cases at baseline or during follow-up was likely to be nondiffer-
ential in either situation and would have resulted in underestima-
tion of the association. Finally, this population had high fish/
shellfish consumption; thus, our results may not be generaliz-
able to the populations with lower intakes of fish/shellfish.
In this Chinese population, we found that high intakes of
red meat and poultry were associated with a higher risk of

 T2D, and the association with poultry may be mediated by
heme iron. In addition, heme iron only partially explained
the detrimental effect of red meat consumption, and other
chemicals in red meat may also account for the higher risk.
Replacement of red meat and poultry with fish/shellfish may
reduce T2D risk, and it is worth testing this theory in experi-
mental studies.
