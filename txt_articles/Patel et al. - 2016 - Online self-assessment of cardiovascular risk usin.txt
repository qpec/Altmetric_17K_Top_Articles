ABSTRACT
Objective: A modified version of the Joint British
Societies ( JBS3) ‘heart age’ tool was introduced online
to broaden access to personalised risk assessment to
the general population and encourage participation in
the National Health Service (NHS) Health Check
programme. This study reports on its early uptake and
the profiles of those who used the self-assessment
tool to determine their own cardiovascular risk.
Design: Observational, retrospective analysis of online
tool use.
Setting: Between February and July 2015, user data
collected from the NHS Choices website, where the
tool was hosted, were analysed anonymously using
standard analytic packages.
Results: The online tool landing page was viewed 1.4
million times in the first 5 months, with increased
activity following limited media coverage. Of the
575 782 users completing the data journey with a valid
‘heart age’ result, their demographic and risk factor
profiles broadly resembled the population of England,
although both younger users and males (60%) were
over-represented. Almost 50% and 79% did not know
or enter their blood pressure or total cholesterol values,
respectively. Estimated heart age was higher than
chronological age for 79% of all users, and also for
69% of younger users under 40 years who are at low
10-year risk and not invited for NHS Health Checks.
Conclusions: These data suggest a high level of public
interest in self-assessment of cardiovascular risk when
an easily understood metric is used, although a large
number of users lack awareness of their own risk
factors. The heart age tool was accessed by a group not
easily reached by conventional approaches yet is at high
cardiovascular risk and would benefit most from early
and sustained risk reduction. These are both important
opportunities for interventions to educate and empower
the public to manage better their cardiovascular risk and
promote population-level prevention.
INTRODUCTION
Despite a 44% reduction in cardiovascular
disease (CVD) mortality in the UK following
the
introduction
of
government
health
policies, novel treatments and public health
initiatives over the last decade, CVD still con-
tributes to a third of all deaths each year,
while rising levels of obesity, diabetes and an
ageing population threaten to reverse these
gains.1–3 In response to this challenge, and
understanding that CVD begins early in life,
the National Health Service (NHS) Health
Check programme was introduced in 2009
for those aged 40–74 years to identify indivi-
duals at high risk for CVD at a relatively
young age and encourage them to modify
their lifestyle with or without therapeutic
intervention to prevent onset of disease later
in life.4 Among criticisms of the approach
was the use of a 10-year risk estimate, which
is not intuitive for the public to understand
and which may provide false security for
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ The first study on the uptake and use of the
Joint British Societies (JBS3)-derived ‘heart age’
tool by members of the public in the UK for self-
assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
risk.
▪ Academic and public health collaboration with
full access and analysis of anonymised online
data for over 500 000 users, collected through
the
National
Health
Service
(NHS)
Choices
website.
▪ Unrestricted access to the tool for the public,
thus enabling assessment and reporting on the
characteristics of users choosing to self-assess
risk.
▪ Through analysis of online entries, the study was
able to demonstrate the levels of knowledge
members of the public have about their CVD risk
factors.
▪ As this work describes online behaviour only,
further study is required to explore the impact of
self-assessment of risk using the ‘heart age’ on
perception of risk and behaviour change.

 younger people who despite substantially elevated risk
factor levels often fall below the 10% threshold for inter-
vention which is currently recommended.5 6
In 2014, the Joint British Societies for the prevention
of CVD published guidelines ( JBS3) that introduced a
novel risk calculator for estimation and communication
of CVD risk, based on the lifetime impact of risk factors
on CVD using the QRisk Algorithm.7 8 This included
estimation of a ‘heart age’ and also permitted demon-
stration of the benefits of interventions, especially when
they are introduced at an earlier age and are sustained.
In February 2015, a public facing version of the JBS3
‘heart age’ tool was developed in conjunction with
Public
Health
England
(PHE),
the
British
Heart
Foundation (BHF) and NHS Choices (The government
run health website for the NHS) as part of the wider
response to the Department of Health’s CVD Outcomes
strategy with its emphasis on prevention and risk factor
control.9 This was launched on the NHS Choices
website aiming to empower individuals proactively to
manage their risk factors and potentially to improve
NHS Health Checks programme participation.4 10
There has been tremendous enthusiasm from the
public with over 1.4 million hits to the website in
5 months. Here, we report on the characteristics of indi-
viduals who chose to assess their own CVD risk online
including their demographic and risk factor profiles,
together with their knowledge of their risk factors and
subsequent online actions. Our findings have potential
implications for strategies designed to improve public
understanding of personalised CVD risk and to enhance
delivery of national CVD prevention initiatives.
METHODS
Data generated through user interaction with the NHS
Choices website page website hosting the heart age tool
is continuously captured and stored in an analytics data-
base. These data were made available to the authors for
aggregate analysis and reporting.
Study population
Data from all users were collected from the launch date
of the tool (11 February) to 9 July 2015. Data were not
restricted to any condition for estimation of website hit
counts, but detailed descriptive analysis was limited to
those who completed the user journey yielding a valid
‘heart age’. By using the tool, users consented to provid-
ing data items online and use of their data in an anon-
ymised fashion. Postcode (location) data were requested
to estimate the Townsend score for deprivation, a means
of assessing affluence based on residential location,11
but was not stored. No other personal identifiable data
including IP address were requested or captured.
Data sources
JBS3 heart age tool: Full details of the JBS3 risk calculator
have
been
published
previously.7
The
calculator
estimates a ‘heart age’, through multivariable modelling
which is referenced to someone of the same age, gender
and ethnicity with optimal risk factors (eg, non-smoker,
blood pressure (BP) 120 mm Hg). Although freely avail-
able online (http://www.jbs3risk.com), the JBS3 calcula-
tor was designed for use by healthcare professionals to
communicate risk and treatment opportunities to their
patients.
We developed a public facing version of the tool in
partnership with PHE and the BHF to allow members of
the public to assess their own CVD risk. Of the novel
metrics, ‘heart age’ was considered the most user-
friendly and acceptable for public use and interpret-
ation. This heart age tool has six pages, screenshots and
full descriptions of which are presented in table 1. Users
are guided through each step, requesting basic details
such as age, gender, ethnicity, postcode, before moving
onto risk behaviours and then measures including
height, weight, total cholesterol and BP
. Questions are
presented in a simple yes/no format with open fields for
numerical inputs. A choice of units is available to facili-
tate data entry. The end result, assuming valid data entry
at each step, is generation of a ‘heart age’, defined as
above. Users with a history of established CVD were not
eligible to use the tool. Details of the data items
requested at each stage are listed in online supplemen-
tary methods.
This modified heart age tool, hosted on the NHS
Choices website, was launched on 11 February 2015 to
complement
the
NHS
Health
Check
programme
(https://www.nhs.uk/tools/pages/heartage.aspx).4 After
estimation of a ‘heart age’, users were invited to follow
web links that offered advice on reducing specific risk
factors aiming to trigger behaviour change or increase
uptake of the NHS Health Check programme.
Data analysis
All variables were analysed as either continuous or cat-
egorical traits
with
summary statistics
generated as
counts,
proportions
(%),
means
(SD)
or
medians
(IQR). Thereafter, detailed analysis was only performed
for those who completed the user journey yielding a
valid heart age.
User profiles: Age was categorised by 10-year groupings
and also assessed as 40–74, reflecting the NHS Health
Check age range. Postcode was provided in a subset of
the data and used to generate the Townsend score of
deprivation.11 Electoral ward-level Townsend deprivation
scores were based on the 2001 Census.12 Knowledge
gaps were estimated based on the proportion of people
who did not enter numerical values for height, weight,
BP and total cholesterol. Risk factor prevalence was esti-
mated as proportion of users reporting current smoking,
hypertension
(treated
or
>140 mm Hg
systolic
BP
(SBP)),
hypercholesterolaemia
(total
cholesterol
>5 mmol/L), diabetes and obesity (body mass index
(BMI)≥30 kg/m2). Comparison to England population
estimates was made using Census and HSE survey data.13

RESULTS
Between 11 February and 9 July 2015, the JBS3 heart
age tool landing page was accessed 1 439 486 times with
a median of 1443 hits per day (IQR 1128–2697). Tool
use fluctuated over time with spikes in activity corre-
sponding to media coverage and press releases. Most
noticeably, following national newspaper coverage, the
site was accessed over 550 000 times in 1 day alone (see
online supplementary figure S1).
In total, there were 592 571 completed data journeys.
Among those not completing the journey (n=846 915),
the majority of dropout (n=355 224) was at the front
page (‘splash’ screen) with a steady attrition rate at each
subsequent page (table 1).

 ‘heart age’. This excludes 16 789 users in whom a heart
age could not be calculated due to out of range data, or
who self-reported prior CVD (n=14 249).
Heart age tool users and population representativeness
Age: There was an inverse trend with age and tool use,
with nearly a third of users <40 years (30.6% women,
32.8% men). Two-thirds of users were between the ages
of 40 and 74 (68% women and 64.9% men), the target
age for the NHS Health Checks (figure 1), with only
1.4% of women and 2.3% of men 75 years or over (see
online supplementary table S1). The user 5-year age
profile correlates well with the England 5-year age profile
from age 25 to 85 years (R=0.95; Office for National
Statistics (ONS) 2014, data not shown).14 Overall, among
tool users, there were more people aged 30–60 and fewer
older people >75 years (2% of all users).
Gender: Initially there were more female online users
(52%), although this changed appreciably after media
releases which enhanced awareness of the tool and its
application
(see
online
supplementary
figure
S2).
Overall, among those completing the data journey,
61.1% of risk estimates were for male participants.
Ethnicity: The majority (86.94%) of users self-reported
ethnicity as white (also the default option if left blank).
Of the remainder, users identified as ‘other’ (3.73%),
‘Indian’
(3.33%),
‘other
Asian’
(2.87%),
‘Chinese’
(1.05%) and ‘Pakistani’ (0.85%). There were substan-
tially
fewer
‘black
African’,
‘black-Caribbean’
and
‘Bangladeshi’ users (0.62%, 0.40% and 0.21%, respect-
ively). The majority (86.9%) of users self-reported ethni-
city as white (also the default option if left blank). Of
the
remainder,
users
identified
as
‘other’
(3.8%),
‘Indian’ (3.3%), ‘other Asian’ (2.9%), ‘Chinese’ (1.0%)
and ‘Pakistani’ (0.9%). There were substantially fewer
‘black
African’,
‘black-Caribbean’
and
‘Bangladeshi’
users (0.6%, 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively).
Postcode: Only 39.4% (n=226 824) entered a valid
England postcode with which a Townsend score for
deprivation could be estimated, with older users and
women being more likely to provide valid details (see
online supplementary figure S3). Where the Townsend
score could be estimated, it showed excellent coverage
of the full deprivation scale with the distribution match-
ing well with Census data for England (figure 2).12
Knowledge gaps
Information on entered numerical values was available for
a 3-month period (May to July) for 138 252 users complet-
ing the user journey. Almost all users entered a plausible
height (120–210 cm, 99.1%) and weight (40–200 kg,
98.2%). If users did not know their total cholesterol or BP
values, national averages were applied (∼130 000 quit their
data journey at this stage). From the entered data, 91.9%
entered plausible total cholesterol (2–15 mmol/L) data
while 8.4% entered non-plausible BP values (<50 or
>250 mm Hg).
Cholesterol: Almost 4 out of 5 people (78.8%) did not
know or input their total cholesterol values. This was
slightly higher for females (81.6%) than males (77.0%)
and this difference was seen for all age groups (figure 3A).
Older participants (>75 years) were more likely to know
their total cholesterol values compared with younger parti-
cipants (<40 years; 31.1% vs 11.1%). Among those eligible
for the NHS Health Check, almost three-quarters (74.3%)
did not know or input their total cholesterol values.
Blood pressure: Half of all users (49.5%) did not enter
or report knowing their SBP
. This was similar in men
(49.5%) and women (49.6%; figure 3B), although older
users tended to know their values more compared with

In combination, almost half of users (47.5%) did not
know their BP or total cholesterol values, whereas 19.2%
knew both values, and 2.0% knew their total cholesterol
but not their BP levels (figure 3C).
Risk factors and risk estimates
Body mass index: The mean BMI was 26.8 kg/m2 (SD 5.8;
median 25.7 kg/m2, IQR 6.0); 5% were underweight
(BMI<20 kg/m2), while 36.2% were overweight (BMI
25–29 kg/m2),
and
21.2%
obese
(BMI≥30 kg/m2).
Compared with HSE data, for each age category, height,
weight and BMI were almost identical (see online sup-
plementary figure S4).13
Cholesterol: Mean total cholesterol was 5.0 mmol/L (SD
1.3; median 5.0 mmol/L, IQR 1.5), with 43% reporting
a value above this level. Both the average value and pro-
portion with high total cholesterol (>5 mmol/L) was
lower than that for the population of England, for each
gender and age group, although this difference was atte-
nuated for older users13 (see online supplementary
figure S5).
Blood pressure: Mean SBP was 121.4 mm Hg (SD 20.7;
median 120 mm Hg, IQR 22), with ∼9.4% reporting
values >140 mm Hg. Overall, 21% either reported a SBP
of >140 mm Hg or were treated for hypertension. These
figures for hypertension are comparable to population
estimates for England, for all age and gender groups13
(see online supplementary figure S6).

 conditions were: diabetes 4.5% (6.2%); kidney disease
1.1% (4.3%); rheumatoid arthritis 3.0% (0.7%); atrial
fibrillation (AF) 2.6% (1.6%) and treated high BP
18.6% (13.7%; see online supplementary table S2).
Ethnic differences: Trends towards ethnic differences
were apparent in the distribution of CVD risk factors
and medical conditions. Among others, the lowest
smoking rates were reported by participants identifying
as Chinese (11.3%, n=681), hypertension was highest
among those of Afro-Caribbean ancestry (24.5%) and
diabetes was most prevalent in those of Indian ancestry
(9.4%) who also had the lowest prevalence of AF (1.1%;
figure 4 and see online supplementary table S2).
Heart age: In total, 79.2% of all users completing the
data journey through to the results page had a calcu-
lated heart age older than their chronological age, while
only 8.4% were younger than their chronological age.
Among younger users <40 years of age, 87% of males
had a predicated heart age older than their chrono-
logical age, compared with 41% of women, despite low
traditional 10-year risk estimates. Of these, 28% had a
heart age greater than chronological age by at least
5 years and 14% by more than 5 years (figure 5 and see
online supplementary table S3).
Subsequent actions
After completing the data journey, 2.8% of users fol-
lowed the given links on the results page, pointing to
information on how to reduce specific risk factors.
DISCUSSION
This study, exploring the early use of the JBS3-derived
heart age tool hosted on the NHS Choices website,
demonstrates three key findings: (1) there is a very high
level of public interest in CVD risk self-assessment when
an easily understood risk metric is used; (2) many users
do not know their risk factor values, emphasising the
potential for NHS Health Check to fill this knowledge
gap; and (3) greater use of the tool by younger users
reveals a substantial and untreated risk burden, with
implications for CVD prevention programmes.
Evidence from randomised studies have shown signifi-
cant improvement in risk factors as well as a greater
emotional impact to effect behaviour change when
‘heart age’ was communicated compared with standard
metrics.16

 and weight reductions over 12 months in men and
women compared with controls and those receiving
standard 10-year risk estimates. This was the impetus to
develop the public facing version of the JBS3 heart age
calculator, to broaden access to CVD risk assessment, to
empower individuals proactively to manage their risk
factors and potentially to improve NHS Health Checks
programme participation.4
There was a high uptake of the online heart age tool
despite limited publicity. Within 6 months of launching,
575 000 users completed the six-page journey with the
site experiencing a median of 1443 hits per day.
Currently, the tool is the third most widely used applica-
tion per day on the NHS Choices website, despite only
being recently introduced and of much greater complex-
ity, highlighting the potential of web-based tools for CVD
prevention. Notably, there was a significant impact on
uptake following media coverage,18 19 with spikes in activ-
ity and a shift in user profiles. For example, the predom-
inant user gender started as female but ended as male,
which is unusual for this type of survey or health app.
Potential explanations may include partners or family
members entering data for male spouses, for example.
Valuable information is provided by the data on knowl-
edge gaps in risk factor levels. Despite being sufficiently
motivated to access and complete the tool, almost 80%
of users reported not knowing their total cholesterol
level and 50% a BP-level reading. A previous study of
users of another online Heart Age tool derived from the
Framingham risk calculator and delivered as part of the
Flora/Becel marketing campaign, identified remarkably
similar numbers with 77% and 47% of users not
knowing their total cholesterol or BP values, respect-
ively.20 Our study differs from this report as the JBS3
tool was derived from a more contemporary risk calcula-
tor (QRisk, incorporating other variables like depriv-
ation index) and offered within the remit of the NHS as
part of a wider public health campaign to encourage
people to participate in the national Health Checks pro-
gramme. Nonetheless the messages are consistent and
figures are in line with national estimates for awareness
of risk factor levels in the UK and in other countries,
such as in the USA or Australia which have targeted this
problem with a ‘Know Your Numbers’ campaign.21
These data point to an ongoing need to educate and
empower the public to reduce their risk factor burden
and provides support for initiatives such as the NHS
Health Check programme that provide an accessible
and equitable service to facilitate this drive.
Digital media often accesses a different demographic.
While users of the heart age tool were broadly represen-
tative of the population of England in terms of ethnicity
and deprivation categories, younger users and males
were over-represented. The fact that a younger, poten-
tially more ‘tech-savvy’ population was accessed, which is
different to that attending general practitioner practices
for the NHS Health Check or elsewhere is valuable and
has important implications. Among those <40 years, over
69% had a heart age older than their chronological age.
In particular, 28% of young males had a heart age
greater than their chronological age by at least 5 years.
These individuals are likely to benefit most from early
CVD risk factor discussions and intervention, yet are not
eligible for NHS Health Checks.
Where values were entered, height, weight and BP dis-
tributions were similar to the UK population survey data,
supporting the representativeness of those accessing the
tool, although overall total cholesterol, BP values and
smoking
prevalence
appeared
to
be
lower
than
expected. Prevalence of other medical conditions was
broadly consistent with expected population estimates.
Some ethnic differences, such as the higher prevalence
of diabetes in South Asians, are well documented and
support the validity of the data, while lower prevalence
of AF in these same groups offers further avenues for
research.
A number of refinements to the online tool are
planned to understand better user characteristics, in par-
ticular where in the UK the site was accessed from, user
motivation
and
circumstances
under
which
it
was
accessed. Nevertheless, there are some limitations with
the current work. First, the nature of online tools means
these data are not necessarily exclusive for the UK popu-
lation, although sensitivity analyses based on a valid
England postcode (to indicate UK residence) did not
suggest significant differences to the results presented.
There is also the possibility that some users may have
completed the data journey several times, for demonstra-
tion purposes or entered fictitious data. Finally high
levels of ideal (eg, SBP of 120 mm Hg) or missing values
could also introduce erroneous ‘heart age’ estimates, as
has been shown previously.20 Although values are likely
to be underestimated rather than overestimated with
conservative default values, these data should nonethe-
less be interpreted with caution.
To ensure ease of use and interpretation, the NHS
Choices platform did not enable individuals to deter-
mine their own potential gain by specific risk factor
reduction, as offered by the full JBS3 risk tool. This may
have contributed to the disappointing number (2.8%)
who followed links for information on risk factor reduc-
tion, although it remains unclear how many users dis-
cussed their result with any health professionals, or
sought
help
from
other

Nonetheless, it is clear that there is both a need and an
opportunity to leverage the public’s interest in risk
assessment to help initiate behaviour change, building
on the heart age metric and demonstrating clear perso-
nalised opportunities for health gains from specific
interventions such as smoking cessation (eg, number of
life years gained by quitting, projected reduction in
heart age). A number of questions remain, including
the sustainability of any behavioural changes and any
impact on CVD outcomes, which could potentially be
addressed in the UK because of the unified healthcare
system and unique patient identifiers.

 In summary, there is tremendous enthusiasm from the
public for self-assessment of CVD risk, when an easily
understood metric is offered. Users reached by online
and digital media are precisely those who would benefit
most from early risk factor control and lifetime risk
reduction. Many people are unaware of their own risk
factors, which is a major barrier to understanding their
risk, and wider knowledge is the first step towards effect-
ing behaviour change. There is thus an important
opportunity to leverage the public’s interest in self-
assessment of risk and combine it with traditional efforts
such as the NHS Health Checks programme to reach
synergistically, educate and empower the public to better
understand and manage their CVD risk.
