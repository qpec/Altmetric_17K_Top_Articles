Summary
Background Antimicrobial resistance is a serious threat to public health, with most antibiotics prescribed in primary 
care. General practitioners (GPs) report defensive antibiotic prescribing to mitigate perceived risk of future hospital 
admission in children with respiratory tract infections. We developed a clinical rule aimed to reduce clinical 
uncertainty by stratifying risk of future hospital admission.
Methods 8394 children aged between 3 months and 16 years presenting with acute cough (for ≤28 days) and 
respiratory tract infection were recruited to a prognostic cohort study from 247 general practitioner practices in 
England. Exposure variables included demographic characteristics, parent-reported symptoms, and physical 
examination signs. The outcome was hospital admission for respiratory tract infection within 30 days, collected using 
a structured, blinded review of medical records.
Findings 8394 (100%) children were included in the analysis, with 78 (0·9%, 95% CI 0·7%–1·2%) admitted to hospital: 
15 (19%) were admitted on the day of recruitment (day 1), 33 (42%) on days 2–7; and 30 (39%) on days 8–30. Seven 
characteristics were independently associated (p<0·01) with hospital admission: age <2 years, current asthma, illness 
duration of 3 days or less, parent-reported moderate or severe vomiting in the previous 24 h, parent-reported severe 
fever in the previous 24 h or a body temperature of 37·8°C or more at presentation, clinician-reported intercostal or 
subcostal recession, and clinician-reported wheeze on auscultation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
(AUROC) curve for the coeffi
  cient-based clinical rule was 0·82 (95% CI 0·77–0·87, bootstrap validated 0·81). Assigning 
one point per characteristic, a points-based clinical rule consisting of short illness, temperature, age, recession, wheeze, 
asthma, and vomiting (mnemonic STARWAVe; AUROC 0·81, 0·76–0·85) distinguished three hospital admission risk 
strata: very low (0·3%, 0·2–0·4%) with 1 point or less, normal (1·5%, 1·0–1·9%) with 2 or 3 points, and high (11·8%, 
7·3–16·2%) with 4 points or more.
Interpretation Clinical characteristics can distinguish children at very low, normal, and high risk of future hospital 
admission for respiratory tract infection and could be used to reduce antibiotic prescriptions in primary care for 
children at very low risk.

Introduction
Combating 
the 
present 
and 
future 
threats 
of 
antimicrobial resistance is high on policy agendas inter-
nationally.1–3 A key goal of the UK1 strategy is to slow 
emergence 
of 
antimicrobial 
resistance 
through 
judicious antibiotic prescribing. The vast majority of 
infections are managed outside of secondary care, with 
more than 80% of all health-service antibiotics pre-
scribed by primary care clinicians.4 Antibiotic pre-
scribing in primary care is increasing5 and directly 
aff
 ects antimicrobial resistance.6 Given that up to 50% 
of prescribed antibiotics are considered unnecessary,2 
primary care is a high priority area for antimicrobial 
stewardship research.1,7
Respiratory tract infections and cough in children (due 
to upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, 
bronchiolitis, infective exacerbation of asthma, and 
pneu 
monia) are the most common respiratory tract 
infection syndromes managed by health services inter-
nationally.8,9 Primary care clinicians acknowledge that 
they prescribe antibiotics for a range of medical and non-
medical reasons,10 particularly in children, who are seen 
as vulnerable11 and whose clinical state can change 
rapidly. Many clinicians report that they prescribe 
antibiotics just in case,12 to mitigate perceived risk of 
future hospital admission and complications,13,14 and that 
failing to provide a prescription for a child who 
subsequently becomes seriously unwell is professionally

unacceptable.11 If primary care clinicians could identify 
children at low (or very low) risk of such future 
complications, the reduced clinical uncertainty could 
lead to a reduced use of antibiotics in these groups of 
patients.
This Article reports the assembly and analysis of a 
prospective cohort to develop and internally validate a 
clinical rule to identify children presenting with a 
respiratory tract infection at risk of future hospital 
admission. Specifi
 cally, we postulated that baseline 
clinical characteristics could be used to distinguish good 
from poor prognosis in children presenting to primary 
care with acute respiratory tract infection and cough, and 
that clinically useful coeffi
  cients (for use with computer 
assistance) and points-based algorithms could be 
developed.
Methods
Study design and participants
This study15 was a prospective, prognostic cohort study 
recruiting participants between July, 2011, and June, 2013; 
the design of this study has been described previously.15 
Briefl
 y, general practitioners and prescribing nurse 
practitioners (referred to from here on as clinicians) 
working in general practitioner practices were trained by 
four UK university hubs (Bristol, London, Oxford, and 
Southampton). In order to minimise confounding by 
indication, clinicians who self-reported prescribing 
antibiotics in 30% or less of children with respiratory tract 
infections were invited to recruit and in order to minimise 
recruitment bias in the study, were asked to identify a 
priori their preferred recruitment strategy (consecutive or 
fi
 rst eligible on the day).
Children were eligible for recruitment if they were 
aged between 3 months and 16 years and presented with 
the main symptom of acute (≤28 days) cough with other 
respiratory tract infection symptoms (such as fever and 
coryza). Children with an infected exacerbation of asthma 
and those who were severely unwell (eg, requiring same-
day hospital assessment or admission) were included. 
Children were excluded if they presented with a non-
infective exacerbation of asthma, were at high risk of 
serious infection (immunocompromised, for example 
with cystic fi
 brosis), required a throat swab for clinical 
management (which were taken for research purposes in 
a subgroup of children), had been previously recruited to 
the study or recently participated in other research, or 
had temporarily registered at the practice.
Procedures
Clinicians were asked to record reasons for not inviting 
potentially eligible children to participate in the study and 
to report a global illness severity (successfully used in a 
previous study16 and scored from zero to ten) for those 
invited but declining participation. After receiving 
informed consent from the children’s parents (and assent 
from children aged ≥11 years), clinicians completed a 
structured online (or paper) case report form (appendix). 
This form recorded eight sociodemographic and four past 
medical history items, 33 parent-reported symptoms 
Research in context 
Evidence before this study
At the time of funding, we did a systematic review for previous 
studies investigating factors associated with poor prognosis in 
children presenting to primary care with acute cough and 
respiratory tract infection. We searched MEDLINE for articles 
published from 1966 to January, 2012) using the following 
search terms: “respiratory tract infection [MeSH Terms] OR 
respiratory infection* OR rti OR lrti OR urti OR lri OR uri OR chest 
infection* OR cough OR dyspnoea OR congestion OR (lung 
consolidation) OR (lobar pneumonia) OR (diffi
  cult breath*) OR 
respiration disorder* AND child* OR schoolchild* OR preschool* 
OR pediatric* OR paediatric* OR parent OR parents OR parental 
OR mother OR father OR mom OR dad OR mum OR caregiver 
OR guardian OR carer OR infant OR infancy AND primary care 
OR family practice OR general practice OR family medicine OR 
community healthcare OR primary healthcare OR ambulatory 
care NOT asthma OR malaria OR tuberculosis”. We found no 
prognostic evidence to support GPs in identifying children at 
lowest or highest risk of future complications.
Added value of this study
This is the fi
 rst primary care cohort study to identify the 
baseline characteristics of children with acute respiratory tract 
infection and cough (the most common problem managed by 
health-care services internationally) at risk of future poor 
outcome. The study showed hospital admission for respiratory 
tract infection in the 30 days after recruitment was 
uncommon, but could be accurately predicted with a clinical 
rule consisting of short illness, temperature, age, recession, 
wheeze, asthma, and vomiting (mnemonic STARWAVe). Using 
a simple one-point-per-item, STARWAVe could be used to 
stratify children into one of three hospital admission risk 
groups: very low, normal, and high risk. 
Implications of all the available evidence
STARWAVe could reduce clinical uncertainty, and thereby 
antibiotic use, in children at very low risk of future hospital 
admission who form the majority of children presenting to 
primary care with acute respiratory tract infection and cough. If 
antibiotic prescription in this group halved, remained static in 
the normal risk stratum, and increased to 90% in the high risk 
stratum, a 10% overall reduction in antibiotic prescribing would 
be achieved, similar to other contemporary antimicrobial 
stewardship interventions.

(including symptom severity of either mild, moderate, or 
severe in the previous 24 h), 14 physical examination signs 
(including vital signs and global illness severity), and the 
prescription of antibiotics. Children were assessed for 
current asthma at medical notes review, which was deemed 
present if asthma was noted in the medical notes and 
asthma medication was issued in the previous 12 months. 
All baseline data, except for asthma, were collected blinded 
to the main outcome.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was hospital admission (excluding 
emergency department attendance only) for any 
respiratory tract infection in the 30 days after recruitment 
and was done blind to baseline characteristics. This 
information was collected using a structured review of 
the primary care electronic medical record, including 
reading scanned hospital discharge summaries. Any 
practices not completing review forms were telephoned 
for the primary outcome. A double review of medical 
notes was done for all participants admitted to hospital 
and a further random 1% of participants to estimate inter-
rater reliability.
Statistical analysis
Our original sample size estimate assumed a 5% two-
sided signifi
 cance level, 80% power, 2% of patients 
admitted to hospital, and the requirement to detect odds 
ratio (OR) of 2·4 (ORs of between 2·5 and 5 had been 
previously observed)17 with a predictor prevalence of 25%, 
giving a required analytical sample of 2588 participants. 
Assuming 10% attrition, 30% prescription of antibiotics 
(in case confounding by indication required their 
exclusion), and a 50:50 data split for derivation and 
validation, a sample of 8216 participants was needed. 
However, hospital admissions were lower than expected18 
and because bootstrap internal validation is considered 
to be better than data splitting in the presence of few 
outcome events,19 a revised sample size of 5751 provided 
80% power to detect an OR of 2·4 with a hospital 
admission rate of 1% and, in the absence of confounding 
by indication where all children contributed to analysis, 
8216 children increased the power to 95%.
All data were analysed using Stata (version 13.1). We 
compared illness severity of recruited children with 
children declining study participation. We calculated 
kappa scores to assess inter-rater reliability of the main 
outcome. Univariable analyses to describe associations 
between candidate predictors and hospital admission, 
and to test for model entry, were done with logistic 
regression. χ², Fisher’s exact tests, and non-parametric 
tests (such as the Mann-Whitney) were used to test 
several categories and non-normal distributions.
Multivariable 
analysis 
was 
done 
with 
logistic 
regression. Symptom severity (mild, moderate, or severe) 
was dichotomised between severe and other categories if 
more than 5% of symptoms were severe, or between 
moderate and mild if 5% or less were severe. Recognised 
clinical cutoff
 s were used for continuous data (eg, 
temperature >37·8°C,20 age-related heart and respiratory 
rates,21 oxygen saturation ≤95%,22 and capillary refi
 ll time 
≥3 
s).21 
Remaining 
continuous 
variables 
were 
dichotomised with upper or lower quartile thresholds as 
appropriate. Deprivation was assigned using the UK 
2008 census Index of Multiple Deprivation score zip 
codes.23
The initial model inclusion criterion was p<0·05 with 
putative predictors entered using backward-stepwise 
selection and retained where p<0·01. For sensitivity 
analyses, a slightly less conservative p value of <0·05 
was used to explore eff
 ects of other putative predictors. 
The ability of the model to discriminate between 
hospitalised 
and 
non-hospitalised 
children 
was 
summarised using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC) curve, with 95% CIs. We 
internally validated coeffi
  cient-based models with the 
bootstrap procedure described by Steyerberg24 using 
200 iterations to calculate a validated AUROC and a 
calibration slope (shrinkage factor) by which we 
multiplied model coeffi
  cients to derive internally 
validated ORs.
Further sensitivity analyses were done to explore the 
eff
 ect on the AUROC of dichotomising continuous 
variables and collapsing multicategorical variables. 
Residual outliers of the fi
 nal model were tested for 
goodness of fi
 t. Potential interactions between all 
predictors in the model and variables excluded from the 
model but of borderline signifi
 cance were also tested. 
The role of antibiotic prescription and potential for 
confounding by indication was investigated by calculating 
the AUROC of the fi
 nal model excluding children 
prescribed antibiotics and using propensity scoring.
To develop a rule for clinical use without a computer, 
we developed a scoring system with Wald estimates 
(calculated by dividing the coeffi
  cient by its standard 
error, squaring it, and rounding it) of each predictor and 
a simpler scoring system in which one point was given to 
each predictor. For both approaches, the stratifi
 cation of 
children into very low, normal, and high risk of hospital 
admission was decided using the sensitivity and 
specifi
 city for each potential cutoff
  compared with the 
overall risk of hospital admission. This study is registered 
on UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio as the 
TARGET study, reference number 9334.

Results
519 general practitioners and nurse practitioners 
recruited children at 247 practices across England. 
Clinicians off
 ered 9043 invitations to children for study 
recruitment, of which 8879 (98%) were accepted, and for 
which 8394 (95%) received the children’s parents’ valid 
consent; all these children met the eligibility criteria and 
made up the fi
 nal analytical sample (fi
 gure 1). There was 
no diff
 erence in global illness severity score between the 
164 children declining participation (median 3, IQR 2–4) 
and the fi
 nal recruited sample (median 3, IQR 2–4).
In the fi
 nal sample, children’s median age was 3 years 
(IQR 1–6), 4365 (52%) were boys, 6547 (78%) were white 
(similar to UK Census 2011 data),25 and 3121 (37·2%) 
were prescribed an antibiotic. Mothers’ median age at the 
child’s birth was 30 years (IQR 26–34) and 1511 (18·0%) 
mothers smoked (similar result to the 2012 English 
Household survey).26 Families’ median deprivation score 
was 16·7 (IQR 8·8–29·5), also similar to national data 
results.
Medical notes were reviewed for the primary outcome 
for 8394 (100%) children, of whom 78 (0·9%, 95% CI 
0·7%–1·2%) were admitted to hospital for a respiratory 
tract infection in the 30 days after recruitment. Inter-rater 
agreement for admission to hospital for respiratory tract 
infection was 90% (kappa 0·80). Median time to hospital 
admission was 2 days (IQR 1–11), with 15 (19%) of children 
admitted to hospital on the day of recruitment (day 1), 33 
(42%) admitted between days 2 and 7, 11 (14%) admitted 
between days 8 and 14, and 19 (24%) admitted between 
days 15 and 30. Hospital discharge diagnoses were lower 
respiratory tract infection (15 [19%]); bronchiolitis (14 [18%]); 
viral wheeze (12 [15%]); upper respiratory tract infection 
(ten [13%]); croup (six [8%]); infected exacerbation of 
asthma (six [8%]); tonsillitis (fi
 ve [6%]); viral illness (four 
[5%]); febrile illness (two [3%]); pneumonia (one [1%]) and 
missing data (three [4%]), with 26·9% of all discharge 
diagnoses suggesting a possible bacterial cause (lower 
respiratory tract infection, tonsillitis, and pneumonia) for 
which antibiotics might have been needed. Missing data 
for candidate predictors was infrequent (<2%), with the 
exception of oxygen saturation (50%, due to unavailable 
oxygen saturation monitors).
Children who were admitted to hospital were younger, 
more likely to be boys and of white ethnicity, have current 
asthma, and have more consultations for respiratory tract 
infection in the previous 12 months than non-hospitalised 
children (table 1). The number of siblings, breastfeeding 
at 3 months, maternal age, and maternal smoking were 
not associated with hospital admission (data not shown).
Children admitted to hospital had shorter illnesses 
before consultation and higher carer-reported illness 
severity scores than non-hospitalised children (table 1). 
Parents of children admitted to hospital were also more 
likely to report breathing faster, wheezing, vomiting, 
change in cry, fever, disturbed sleep, eating less, dry cough, 
diarrhoea, consuming fewer fl
 uids, and passing less urine. 
There was no evidence of diff
 erences between hospitalised 
and non-hospitalised children with regard to recent illness 
deterioration, productive or wet cough, barking or croupy 
cough, blocked runny nose, and chills, shivering, low 
energy, fatigue, or lethargy (data not shown).
The following 12 examination fi
 ndings were associated 
with increased risk of hospital admission: irritability or 
drowsiness; pallor; nasal fl
 aring; grunting; body 
temperature of 37·8°C or more; oxygen saturation of 
95% or less; increased clinician global impression of 
severity of illness; clinician gut feeling that there was 
something wrong; tachypnoea; intercostal or subcostal 
recession; wheezing; and crackles or crepitations 
(table 1). There was no evidence of diff
 erences between 
hospitalised and non-hospitalised children with regard to 
bronchial breathing (unilateral or bilateral), infl
 amed 
pharynx or tonsils, age-adjusted tachycardia, capillary 
refi
 ll time, or stridor (data not shown).

0·01: age of less than 2 years, current asthma, illness up 
to 3 days before consultation, moderate or severe 
vomiting in the previous 24 h, intercostal or subcostal 
recession, wheeze, and body temperature of 37·8°C or 
more. The initial model AUROC curve was 0·81 (95% CI 
0·77–0·86). The model intercept (–6·65) suggests that 
the probability of hospital admission for children with 
no predictors was 0·14%.
Low oxygen saturation was added to the multivariable 
model but did not reach the prespecifi
 ed threshold 
(p=0·16). Variables with p values between 0·01 and 0·1 
using backward stepwise variable selection were 
examined by adding each one to the initial model. Two 
variables met this criterion, ethnicity (p=0·04) and carer-
reported severe fever (p=0·08). Apart from an 11% higher 
prevalence of white ethnicity among the children 
admitted to hospital, a detailed analysis of ethnic groups 
revealed no further marked diff
 erences and no interaction 
with the variables already in the model. Carer-reported 
severe fever within 24 h was interchangeable with 
clinician-identifi
 ed high temperature in the multivariable 
model, producing similar results. We therefore produced 
a combined variable using the presence of either of these 
markers, which identifi
 ed 25 (32·1%) of 78 hospitalised 
children and 1338 (16·2%) of 8262 non-hospitalised 
children (p<0·001). This combined variable was included 
in the fi
 nal multivariable model (p=0·006) and slightly 
increased the AUROC. Compared with children aged 
3 years or younger, there was an incremental increased 
risk of hospital admission with decreasing age: 
24–35 
months 
OR 
1·64 
(95% 
CI 
0·73–3·67), 
12–23 months OR 3·45 (1·81–6·59), and less than 
12 months OR 4·90 (2·57–9·30; p=0·03). We decided 
against including age as a continuous variable because it 
reduced the AUROC and would be less useful clinically. 
Unilateral or bilateral wheeze was investigated but 
showed insuffi
  cient superiority compared with presence 
or absence of wheeze to warrant separate categorisation. 
A goodness-of-fi
 t test identifi
 ed an outlier of fi
 ve children 
with identical model parameters. When removed, 
parameter estimates changed very little and the goodness-
of-fi
 t test became insignifi
 cant (p=0·88). We found no 
evidence for multiplicative interactions between all 
predictors in the fi
 nal model.
There was no evidence of association between 
hospital admission and the prescription of antibiotics 
at the recruitment consultation (32% in hospitalised 
children and 37% in non-hospitalised children, 
p=0·36). Removing the 3121 children who were 
prescribed antibiotics, backward stepwise regression 
yielded the same variables as the full cohort, with an 
additional clinician variable (gut feeling that something 
was wrong OR 2·23, 95% CI 1·00–5·01, p=0·05). 
Propensity scoring on the full cohort also yielded the 
same initial seven-variable model and forcing antibiotic 
prescription and gut feeling resulted in a slightly 
decreased AUROC. There was also no evidence of 
interactions between initial model variables and 
antibiotic prescribing or gut feeling.
The fi
 nal multivariable model included a combined 
carer-reported severe fever with clinican measured 
temperature of 37·8°C or more variable (table 2). As a

result, the AUROC increased from 0·81 to 0·82 (95% CI 
0·77–0·87, fi
 gure 2). Bootstrap validation yielded a 
diff
 erence of –0·011 (95% CI –0·008 to –0·014), giving a 
fi
 nal validated AUROC of 0·81. Because three of the fi
 nal 
model characteristics could be linked to asthma (current 
asthma, wheezing, and intercostal recession), we did a 
post-hoc assessment of the fi
 nal model in the 750 (8·9%) 
children with asthma, 19 of whom were admitted to 
hospital. Intercostal recession, age younger than 2 years, 
short illness duration, and wheeze remained associated 
with hospital admission, and 95% CIs for vomiting and 
high body temperature or fever in the previous 24 h were 
also consistent with the fi
 nal model 95% CIs (appendix).
Using weighted Wald estimates or a simple scoring 
system yielded a similar probability of hospital admission 
within comparative groups (table 3). The simpler, more 
clinically useful scoring system was therefore chosen; 
the score cutoff
 s for the three diff
 erent groups selected 
were based on the sensitivity and specifi
 city of using 
diff
 erent thresholds. The fi
 nal risk strata (table 3) were 
very low (0·3% risk of hospital admission) containing 
5593 (67%) children, normal (1·5% risk, similar to the 
overall population) for 2520 (30%) children, and high 
(11·8% risk) for 204 (3%) children. The AUROC for this 
fi
 nal points-based model was similar to the coeffi
  cient-
based model (0·81, 95% CI 0·76–0·85). The percentage 
of children with discharge diagnoses suggesting possible 
bacterial infection by risk strata were very low (0·09%), 
normal (0·38%), and high (3·92%). The percentage of 
children prescribed an antibiotic (immediate and 
delayed) by risk strata were also low (33%), normal (44%), 
and high (65%).
Discussion
Using a well characterised, large, representative cohort of 
children presenting to primary care with the most 
frequently managed acute paediatric health-care problem 
internationally, we found that subsequent hospital 
admission was uncommon, and that a simple, one-point-
per-item rule consisting of short (≤3 days) illness; 
temperature; age (<24 months); recession; wheeze; 
asthma; and vomiting (mnemonic STARWAVe) can be 
used to identify children at very low (0·3%), normal 
(1·5%), and high (11·8%) risk of future hospital admission 
for respiratory tract infection. Most admissions were for 
lower respiratory tract infection, bronchiolitis, or viral 
wheeze, with only a quarter of discharge diagnoses 
suggesting a possible bacterial cause for which antibiotics 
might have been indicated.
Our previous systematic review28 suggests that this is 
the largest and most rigorous prognostic study of 
children with respiratory tract infections in primary care. 
Participating children were no less unwell than were 
those who were invited but declined study participation. 
Baseline characteristics were pragmatic, measured 
according to routine clinical practice with standardised 
reporting forms blind to the primary outcome, and with

high levels of data completeness. Our primary outcome 
is clinically relevant, refl
 ects a key driver of primary care 
antibiotic prescribing,13 was assessed blind to baseline 
characteristics with 100% follow-up, and had high levels 
of inter-rater agreement. Because it is not possible to 
eliminate confounding by indication in observational 
studies (clinicians need to use antibiotics in some 
children), we used a less than 30% antibiotic prescribing 
threshold to minimise its eff
 ect, as well as testing for its 
presence by excluding children prescribed antibiotics 
and using propensity scoring. We used a stringent model 
retention criterion (p<0·01) because we had 55 candidate 
predictors and a low number of hospital admissions. We 
developed 
both 
coeffi
  cient 
(requiring 
computer 
assistance) and points-based models, which were 
surprisingly similar in their prognostic value.
The main limitation is the relatively small number of 
hospital admissions for respiratory tract infections, which 
aff
 ects two areas. First, we were not able to externally 
validate the fi
 nal model. Although external validation is 
desirable before clinical application, bootstrap validation 
takes model over-optimism into account and is considered 
better than data splitting, especially in the presence of 
limited outcome events.24 Our results are biologically 
plausible and the associations substantial, and by analogy, 
it is reasonable for clinical practice to change on the basis 
of a single, well done randomised trial. Second, our model 
development breached the widely quoted rule of ten 
events per candidate predictor. However, this is only a rule 
of thumb, with little theoretical or empirical justifi
 cation,29 
and the consequences of variable selection are strongly 
dependent on the strength of association between 
candidate predictors and the outcome. Finally, it is 
possible that other biomarkers could be used to improve 
prognostic certainty, for example, pulse oximetry (our 
missing data might have impeded a full assessment of 
usefulness); 
infl
 ammatory 
markers, 
which 
are 
diagnostically useful;27 and rapid point-of-care pathogen 
tests. We chose not to include C-reactive protein testing 
because of the recruitment disincentive to children of 
taking blood. We considered but discounted assessing 
generalisability by comparing children’s characteristics 
with those of routine datasets because of the variable 
coding of respiratory tract infections in primary care30 and 
the fact that cohort children had acute cough and 
respiratory tract infection, representing a range of under-
lying diagnoses including upper and lower respiratory 
tract infections.
Although new evidence is providing early warning of 
impending critical illness in secondary care,31 we are not 
aware of similar, representative, large-scale studies to 
establish the prognostic usefulness of children’s clinical 
parameters in primary care,28 that is, studies that have 
developed algorithms to predict future complications. 
We are aware of two small primary care studies, the fi
 rst 
of which also showed fever and abnormal chest signs 
predicted 
reconsultation 
for 
worsening 
illness,32 
although the second did not fi
 nd any prognostically 
useful characteristics.33 Other studies34,35 have assessed 
the diagnostic usefulness of symptoms and signs for a 
range of serious infections (including meningitis, 
septicaemia, pyelonephritis, and pneumonia) arising 
within shorter timeframes of index testing, with all but 
one35 done in secondary care. In contrast to our results, 
these studies showed parental concern,34 dyspnoea,35 
and clinician gut feeling35 were useful for diagnosing 
pneumonia.
The main value of our results is to reduce clinical 
uncertainty and antibiotic use in children least likely to 
benefi
 t from them, namely those at very low risk of future 
hospital admission. We believe a no antibiotic strategy 
will be safe in this group for two reasons: fi
 rst, only a 
minority of discharge diagnoses suggested a bacterial 
cause, and second, the preventive value of antibiotics 
against future complications is small in children at 
normal risk of complications,36 so is likely to be very small 
in the very low risk stratum. We believe a no antibiotic or 
delayed antibiotic prescribing strategy is appropriate for 
the middle (normal) risk stratum because this is the 
treatment strategy recommended by NICE for this group37 
and we believe children at high risk of hospital admission 
should be closely monitored for signs of deterioration, 
with consideration given to proactively  arrange same-day 
or next-day follow-up and prescribe an immediate 
antibiotic.
Our data show that 1846 (33%) of the very-low-risk 
stratum children received antibiotics. Because these 
children represent the majority (67%) of all the participants, 
a 10% overall reduction in antibiotic prescription would be 
achieved if prescription in this group halved, remained 
static in the normal risk stratum, and increased to 90% in 
the high risk stratum, resulting in a similar eff
 ect size to 
other contemporary anti 
microbial stewardship inter-
ventions.38,39 Given that national data suggest that 50% of 
children with respiratory tract infection at present receive 
antibiotics,40 eff
 ects could be increased in practices 
providing more prescriptions. The AUROC is useful, but 
not perfect, meaning that the rule should supplement, not 
supplant, clinical judgment. As a result, clinicians should

under which they should reconsult.
Our results complement existing evidence to support 
antimicrobial stewardship in primary care.42–44 Rule 
constituents can be easily measured, taught, and 
remembered by a wide range of health-care professionals, 
as well as incorporated into electronic health record 
templates and decision support tools.
Further research is needed to externally validate the 
rule and to investigate its eff
 ects on antibiotic prescription 
and children’s clinical outcomes. Demographic charac-
teristics, parent-reported symptoms, and clinical exami-
nation fi
 ndings can distinguish children at very low, 
normal, and high risk of future hospital admission for 
respiratory tract infection. General practitioners and 
primary care nurses might fi
 nd this clinical rule useful to 
reduce prescribing antibiotics in children at very low risk 
of future hospital admission.
