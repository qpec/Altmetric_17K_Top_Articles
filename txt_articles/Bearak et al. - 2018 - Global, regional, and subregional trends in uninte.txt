Global, regional, and subregional trends in unintended 
pregnancy and its outcomes from 1990 to 2014: 
estimates from a Bayesian hierarchical model
Jonathan Bearak, Anna Popinchalk, Leontine Alkema*, Gilda Sedgh*
Summary
Background Estimates of pregnancy incidence by intention status and outcome indicate how effectively women and 
couples are able to fulfil their childbearing aspirations, and can be used to monitor the impact of family-planning 
programmes. We estimate global, regional, and subregional pregnancy rates by intention status and outcome for 
1990–2014.
Methods We developed a Bayesian hierarchical time series model whereby the unintended pregnancy rate is a 
function of the distribution of women across subgroups defined by marital status and contraceptive need and use, 
and of the risk of unintended pregnancy in each subgroup. Data included numbers of births and of women estimated 
by the UN Population Division, recently published abortion incidence estimates, and findings from surveys of women 
on the percentage of births or pregnancies that were unintended. Some 298 datapoints on the intention status of 
births or pregnancies were obtained for 105 countries.
Findings Worldwide, an estimated 44% (90% uncertainty interval [UI] 42–48) of pregnancies were unintended in 
2010–14. The unintended pregnancy rate declined by 30% (90% UI 21–39) in developed regions, from 64 (59–81) per 
1000 women aged 15–44 years in 1990–94 to 45 (42–56) in 2010–14. In developing regions, the unintended pregnancy 
rate fell 16% (90% UI 5–24), from 77 (74–88) per 1000 women aged 15–44 years to 65 (62–76). Whereas 
the decline in the unintended pregnancy rate in developed regions coincided with a declining abortion rate, the 
decline in developing regions coincided with a declining unintended birth rate. In 2010–14, 59% (90% UI 54–65) of 
unintended pregnancies ended in abortion in developed regions, as did 55% (52–60) of unintended pregnancies in 
developing regions.
Interpretation The unintended pregnancy rate remains substantially higher in developing regions than in developed 
regions. Sexual and reproductive health services are needed to help women avoid unintended pregnancies, and to 
ensure healthy outcomes for those who do experience such pregnancies.

Introduction
Periodic estimation of the incidence of unintended 
pregnancy is needed so that policy makers, researchers, 
and other stakeholders can track progress towards 
helping women and couples achieve their reproductive 
goals. It also helps demonstrate the need for contraceptive 
services and the impact of programmes and policies on 
unintended pregnancies and their outcomes. These 
estimates can additionally be used to examine variations 
in how women resolve unintended pregnancies across 
settings and over time. Most unintended pregnancies 
occur in developing regions where, combined with 
limited access to safe abortion care, they are an important 
contributor to unsafe abortions world 
wide.1–3 Moreover, 
unintended pregnancies are widely acknowledged as both 
a cause and a consequence of socioeconomic inequality.4,5
Estimating the incidence of unintended pregnancy 
at the national or regional level is challenging. Data 
requirements include information on the proportion 
of births that arise from unintended pregnancies 
(hereafter referred to as unintended births), and data on 
the incidence of abortion. Estimates of the incidence of 
abortion worldwide for all regions and subregions have 
recently been published by a group that includes the 
coauthors of this study for the period 1990–2014.6 
Additionally, a substantial body of nationally repre­
sentative surveys that measure the proportion of births 
that are unintended are available for this same time 
period.
Past estimates of global unintended pregnancy 
incidence relied primarily on computation of sub­
regional averages using available country data and the 
assumption that these averages apply to countries 
without data. Statistical uncertainty in differences 
across regions or over time could not be computed.1 
Building on a method recently developed to estimate

global levels and trends in induced abortion for 
1990–2014, and using estimates of abortion incidence 
for that period,6 as well as the body of available data on 
the proportion of births that are unintended, we 
developed a Bayesian hierarchical time series model7 to 
estimate subregional, regional, and global levels and 
trends in the incidence of unintended pregnancy over 
the period 1990–2014. With the recently estimated 
abortion rates and new estimates of the percentage of 
births that are unintended, applied to general fertility 
rates from the UN Population Division (UNPD), we 
produced estimates of the proportion of all pregnancies 
that are unintended and the proportion of unintended 
pregnancies that end in abortion.
Methods
Background
The statistical model is grounded in a theoretical 
framework in which the incidence of unintended 
pregnancy is a function of the numbers of women with 
an unmet need for contraception (ie, women who want 
to stop or delay childbearing but are not using any 
method of contraception) and women using a 
contraceptive method who experience a method or user 
failure, and the risk of unintended pregnancy in each of 
these subgroups. The risk of unintended pregnancy in 
these subgroups is in turn influenced by women’s 
fecundity and the timing and frequency of their sexual 
activity.8 Along with abortion, which affects the 
percentage of unintended pregnancies that end in a 
birth, these are key proximate determinants of fertility.9
We adapt the theoretical framework to take account of 
the available evidence, and estimate the incidence of 
unintended pregnancy as the sum of events among 
married women with an unmet need, married women 
experiencing failure with a contraceptive method, and all 
unmarried women. Following the standard Demographic 
and Health Survey (DHS) definition, married women 
included those living in a cohabiting union.10 
Data
Pregnancies are comprised of births, abortions, and 
miscarriages. Livebirth estimates for each country 
and year were taken from the UNPD.11 Numbers of 
abortions were taken from special tabulations of recently 
published estimates.6
We searched for data on the percentage of births that 
were unintended for every country and major territory in 
the world for 1990–2014. Data were obtained from 
nationally representative surveys and from published 
studies identified through literature searches. We 
systematically searched PubMed, JSTOR, and Google 
Scholar for a combination of the following terms: 
“incidence”, “unplanned birth”, “unintended pregnancy”, 
“unwanted 
pregnancy”, 
“unplanned 
preg 
nancy”, 
“pregnancy intention”, “unintended births”, “unwanted 
births”, and “pregnancy intention”. We limited the search 
to papers studying the incidence of unintended pregnancy 
between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2014.
In DHS surveys conducted periodically in developing 
countries, a birth is considered unintended if it occurred 
sooner than desired or if it was not wanted at all. Women 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previous estimates of global trends in unintended pregnancy 
were made for 1995, 2008, and 2012. These point estimates 
relied on country-level data on the incidence of unintended births 
and estimates or projections of abortion rates, and qualitative 
assessments of exchangeability to make inference from existing 
data to countries and territories lacking data. Separate databases 
were used to make estimates for each of the 3 years.
Added value of this study
We use birth rates estimated by the UN for 1990–2014, all 
available data on the proportion of births unintended, and 
recently published estimates of abortion incidence and factors 
associated with unintended pregnancy, including 
family-planning indicators for married women, to develop 
model-based estimates of pregnancy rates by intention status 
and outcome in all major regions and subregions of the world 
for 1990–2014. This is the first time that unintended 
pregnancy has been estimated using a statistical model, that 
differences in data quality have been accounted for, and that 
uncertainty intervals have been estimated. Data on 
unintended births and unintended pregnancies were compiled 
from nationally representative surveys done periodically in 
developing and developed countries, and from one-time 
studies that were found through a PubMed literature search 
using multiple combinations of keywords. This data collection 
effort yielded 298 datapoints for 105 countries. We estimate 
that the global unintended pregnancy rate fell from 74 (90% UI 
72–84) per 1000 women aged 15–44 years in 1990–94 to 62 
(59–72) in 2010–14. The proportion of pregnancies that were 
unintended has not changed appreciably, and was 44% (90% 
UI 42–48) in 2010–14. Some 56% (90% UI 53–60) of all 
unintended pregnancies ended in abortion in this period.
Implications of all the available evidence
The findings underscore that women and couples are having 
smaller families and fewer unintended pregnancies in many 
parts of the world. The findings also emphasise the continuing 
need for investments to meet women’s and couples’ 
contraceptive needs. Unintended pregnancy rates remain much 
higher in developing regions compared with developed regions, 
and many of the resulting abortions are unsafe. Additional 
research on the causes and consequences of unintended 
pregnancy are needed to compel appropriate investments in 
programmes and design policies that meet the needs of women 
and couples everywhere.

reported on births in the past 3 or 5 years. A supple­
mentary analysis suggested that the reporting of un­
intended births generally decreased with increasing 
recall periods, although the extent of the decrease varied 
across surveys. Therefore, we only used a woman’s report 
for the year preceding the interview. In total, data 
were tabulated from 219 of these surveys representing 
72 countries (appendix pp 7, 8).
For another 50 DHS and Reproductive Health Surveys 
(RHS) representing 28 countries (including 16 countries 
with no other data sources), the data files were not publicly 
available and estimates were taken from published reports 
(appendix p 8). The reports presented the intention status 
of events in the past 3 or 5 years combined. For the USA, 
three estimates of the proportion of births that were 
unintended in the previous 5 years were calculated from 
the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG).
29 datapoints for 17 countries were obtained from 
another 26 published studies: ten from nationally 
representative studies, six from subnational studies, and 
ten from studies focusing on a specific subpopulation. 
Six of these studies used the London Measure of 
Unplanned Pregnancy (LMUP),12 which uses a 12­item 
scoring system to categorise pregnancies according to 
whether the woman said she planned the pregnancy, did 
not plan it, or was ambivalent about it. Based on a 
comparison of the LMUP to the approach used by the 
DHS,13 we computed the minimum and maximum 
percentage of births that were unintended, excluding 
and including the percentage for which the woman was 
ambivalent about the pregnancy according to the LMUP, 
respectively. For four of these studies, data were available 
on the planning status of all pregnancies, not specifically 
births. These data were also useful because the model 
estimated the distribution of unintended pregnancies by 
outcome, using recently estimated abortion rates.
To further inform model­based estimates of unintended 
pregnancies and births, we used information on the 
proportion of unintended pregnancies or births that were 
experienced by unmarried women from DHS surveys 
and published studies from 195 surveys representing 
69 countries. For DHS data on unintended births, we 
calculated the month of conception as the month of birth 
minus 9, and ascertained marital status in that month. 
Since the DHS recorded the date of first marriage but not 
the date of separation or remarriage, we calculated 
minimum and maximum values for the percentage 
of unintended births to married women. Data on the 
proportion of unintended births that were experienced 
by the subgroup of women who were contraceptive 
users were available from two published studies14,15 (see 
appendix p 9 for details).
Abortions recently estimated to have been obtained 
by women not in need of contraception (comprised 
primarily of women who want a child within 2 years or 
are infecund)16 were classified as intended pregnancies. 
All others were classified as unintended.
Estimates of the number of women of reproductive 
age, the percentage of these women who are married, 
and the percentage of married women with unmet need 
for contraception, no contraceptive need, and met need, 
by country and year, for women aged 15–49 years, were 
taken from the UNPD.17–19 We used estimates of the 
proportion of married contraceptive users expected to 
experience contraceptive failure developed previously 
using method­specific contraceptive prevalence data and 
method­specific failure rates.6
Statistical analysis
A detailed description of the model is available in the 
appendix and summarised below.
We estimated unintended pregnancy rates and the 
corresponding estimates for the number of unintended 
pregnancies and unintended births. The model was fitted 
to all data pertaining to the percentage distribution of 
unintended births and unintended pregnancies by 
subgroup.
To estimate the unintended pregnancy rate, we used 
a Bayesian hierarchical time series model in which 
the dependent variable was the number of unintended 
pregnancies among all women of reproductive age in a 
given country and year. The predictors were the numbers 
of women of reproductive age in each of the three 
subgroups of women (married women with an unmet 
need, married women experiencing failure with a 
contraceptive method, and all unmarried women). The 
model did not include an intercept, and we constrained 
the coefficients to be positive; thus the coefficients 
represent unintended pregnancy rates in population sub­
groups. Overall unintended pregnancy rates in countries 
change over time if subgroup­specific rates change and 
as the sizes of the subgroups change. This follows the 
approach we used to estimate abortion incidence, except 
that the abortion model estimated a subgroup rate 
for married women with no need for contraception.6 
Differences in the proportion of women in each subgroup 
will not capture all variation across countries or over time 
in unintended pregnancy rates. Subgroup rates are 
also influenced by unobserved characteristics including 
women’s fecundity and the timing and frequency of 
their sexual activity. Additionally, global estimates of 
contraceptive use among unmarried women are not 
available, and some women classified as having an 
unmet need might be post partum, with these 
proportions varying across countries and over time. 
Therefore, the model allows the subgroup rates to vary 
across countries and over time to capture the effects of 
these factors, and subgroup rates are not reported.
The model does not estimate variation in miscarriages 
(which are defined here to include all spontaneous fetal 
losses after 5 weeks of gestation, including stillbirths). 
Similar to previous studies, we obtain estimated un­
intended pregnancy rates by multiplying the estimated 
unintended birth rates by 1·2 and the estimated abortion

rates by 1·1.1 This approach is derived from life tables of 
pregnancy loss by gestational age.9,20,21
When we report unintended pregnancy rates, or any 
statistic that involves not just births but also abortions, the 
corresponding uncertainty intervals (UIs) capture the 
uncertainty in the abortion estimates.
We assumed that married women experiencing con­
traceptive failure would experience the highest un­
intended pregnancy rates of the three subgroups. Though 
by definition every woman experiencing a contra 
ceptive 
failure experienced an unintended pregnancy, the 
incidence of unintended pregnancy in this subgroup is 
allowed to vary across countries and regions and over 
time so as to capture variations in user failure rates.
The model assumes that subgroup unintended 
pregnancy rates, and trends in rates, will be more similar 
within subregions than between subregions. A few 
countries or UNPD subregions were merged with other 
subregions with similar measures on demographic and 
family­planning indicators for the analysis (appendix 
p 9). Final results are presented using the original UNPD 
classifications of subregions.
The sampling designs and sample sizes from the 
surveys were used to estimate the SE for data on the 
proportions of births or pregnancies unintended. Because 
this might not fully capture the uncertainty in the input 
data, the model includes additional error terms for the 
average non­sampling error across all surveys and for 
additional error in subnational and subpopulation surveys 
(appendix pp 9, 10). As a result, higher quality data 
influence the modelled estimates more than lower quality 
data. Additionally, variation in uncertainty in the input 
data is reflected in variation across settings and over time 
in the width of the UIs around the estimates.
We did validation exercises whereby 20% of the data 
on birth and pregnancy intention were left out at 
random, and the model­estimated rates for the excluded 
countries and years were compared with the estimates 
made for these countries and years when they were 
included. Additionally, we did a leave­one­country­out 
validation exercise in which, for each country with data, 
we compared the estimates for that country from a 
model with that country’s data included to a model with 
that country’s data excluded. We tested the sensitivity of 
our results to model assumptions and assessed whether 
the inclusion of additional covariates as proxies for 
unobserved behavioural factors could improve the 
model fit (appendix pp 12–18). These exercises showed 
that our estimates are unbiased, that our UIs are well 
calibrated, and that the estimates are approximately 
identical across candidate models (appendix pp 12–18). 
We report results based on the model without additional 
covariates (beyond the numbers of women of 
reproductive age in each of the three subgroups of 
women [married women with an unmet need, married 
women experiencing failure with a contraceptive 
method, and all unmarried women]).
Because of the paucity of evidence on which the 
estimates were based, we present unintended pregnancy 
estimates for 5­year periods rather than annual 
rates, and we present rates for subregions rather than 
for countries. We computed 90% UIs using the 5th 
and 95th percentiles of the posterior distributions. 
The interpretation of such intervals is that there is a 
5% chance that the true outcome is below the interval, 
and there is a 5% chance that the true outcome is above 
the interval. For reported changes in values, posterior

probabilities of an increase or decrease were calculated. 
These probabilities indicate the amount of certainty for 
the reported change: a higher posterior probability 
corresponds to greater certainty about the direction of 
change. Where the posterior probability of change in the 
estimated direction is less than 95%, the UI will include 
the scenario in which no change occurred. We present 
relevant findings for UN subregions and groups of 
countries classified by the legal status of abortion.22

Results
In total, we collected 298 datapoints on the proportion of 
births or pregnancies unintended for 105 countries 
(table 1). Representation was best for Africa, where data 
were available for 42 of the 54 countries, and it was 
weakest for the Latin American region, where data were 
available for 15 of the 35 countries. Of the five time 
periods, we had data for the fewest countries in 1990–94 
and the most for 2005–09. Countries were classed as 
developed and developing based on UNPD definitions.
We report estimated pregnancy and birth rates by 
intention, the estimated percentages of pregnancies and 
births unintended, the estimated percentages of un­
intended pregnancies that end in abortion, and the 
estimated number of unintended pregnancies. Additional 
results, including the estimated numbers of each of 
these events, are available in the appendix (pp 39–44).

We estimate that there were 62 unintended pregnancies 
(90% UI 59–72) per 1000 women aged 15–44 years 
worldwide each year in 2010–14 (figure 1, table 2). This 
rate represents a decline of 17% (90% UI 8–25) since 
1990–94, when the estimated rate was 74 (90% UI 72–84). 
Because of population growth, the absolute number of 
unintended pregnancies is estimated to have increased, 
but only by 6·6% (90% UI –3·0 to 17·8), and the posterior 
probability of change was 88·5%. There were 99·1 million 
(90% UI 94·9–114·9) unintended pregnancies per year in 
2010–14 (appendix p 38).
The unintended pregnancy rate declined 16% (90% UI 
5–24) in developing regions, from 77 (74–88) per 
1000 women aged 15–44 years in 1990–94 to 65 (62–76) in 
2010–14. It fell even more sharply, by 30% (90% UI 
21–39), in developed regions, from 64 (59–81) in 1990–94 
to 45 (42–56) in 2010–14. The decline in developed 
regions was steepest in eastern Europe. In the rest of the 
developed regions, the unintended pregnancy rate was 
already comparatively low in 1990–94 and it declined 16% 
(90% UI 1–31) from 50 (43–70) in 1990–94 to 42 (38–56) 
in 2010–14. In developing regions, substantial declines 
were evident in Africa and in Asia, whereas in no Latin 
American subregion did the decline exceed 9%, and the 
posterior probability of a decline in the Latin American 
subregions ranged from 62·8% to 77·2%.
Of the world’s subregions in 2010–14, the unintended 
pregnancy rate was highest in the Caribbean at 116 
(90% UI 98–156) and eastern Africa at 112 (107–122) per 
1000 women aged 15–44 years. The rates were lowest in 
northern Europe (27 [90% UI 25–33]) and western Europe 
(28 [23–42]; table 2).
Globally, 44% (90% UI 42–48) of pregnancies and 
23% (22–26) of births were unintended in 2010–14 
(appendix pp 40, 41). These percentages were essentially 
unchanged since 1990–94, but the global statistics mask 
substantial regional variation in the time trends. The 
percentage of pregnancies that were unintended 
increased in all the subregions of the Latin American 
region, from 59% (90% UI 55–64) in 1990–94 to 69% 
(64–76) in 2010–14. Additionally, we observed declines 
in the percentage of unintended pregnancies through­
out most of Europe, with the largest decline in eastern 
Europe, where unintended pregnancies declined by 
22% (90% UI 15–29). In the other European subregions, 
the posterior probability of a decline ranged from 71·1% 
to 93·3%. For births, the proportion unintended 
decreased 11% (90% UI 4–17) in Africa. In Asia, the 
posterior probability of a decrease was only 71·8%. The 
estimated proportion of unintended births increased in 
the Latin American region, North America, Oceania, 
southern Africa, and eastern Europe, although the 
evidence for an increase was comparatively weak, such 
that except for the Latin American region, the posterior 
probability of an increase in the percentage of 
unintended births was at most 70·9% in any region and 
at most 80·1% in any subregion.
56% (90% UI 53–60) of all unintended pregnancies 
ended in abortion in 2010–14 (figure 2, table 3). Since 
1990–94, this value increased 11% (90% UI 1–20) 
proportionately in developing regions, from 50% (47–55) 
in 1990–94 to 55% (52–60) in 2010–14, and declined 17% 
(7–24) proportionately in developed regions, from 71% 
(65–76) in 1990–94 to 59% (54–65) in 2010–14. There 
was variation in this probability across subregions in 
2010–14: some 78% (90% UI 71–84) of unintended 
pregnancies ended in abortion in central Asia and 77% 
(71–82) in eastern Europe, compared with 30% (28–34) 
in eastern Africa.
In the group of countries where abortion is pro­
hibited altogether by law or allowed only to save a 
woman’s life, 48% (90% UI 45–54) of unintended 
pregnancies ended in abortion in 2010–14 (table 4). 
This proportion was substantially higher, at 69% 
(90% UI 62–74), in countries where abortion is allowed 
on request.
In developing regions between 1990–94 and 2010–14, 
the unintended birth rate declined 27% (90% UI 16–36) 
and the intended birth rate declined 24% (21–28). 
Although proportionate declines were similar, more of 
the decline in fertility in developing countries was due 
to a decline in intended fertility: the unintended birth 
rate fell by 8 (90% UI 4–12) births per 1000 women aged

15–44 years and the intended birth rate declined by 
23 (19–26) births (appendix pp 42, 43).
Fertility trends in developed regions contrasted with 
those in developing regions in that there was little evidence 
of a decline in unintended fertility, and some evidence of an 
increase in intended fertility, in developed regions. Among 
the developed subregions, the posterior probability of a 
decline in the unintended birth rate was at most 72·8%. 
The intended birth rate increased 10% (90% UI 1–24) in 
western Europe, from 43 (38–46) per 1000 women aged 
15–44 years in 1990–94 to 47 (44–49) in 2010–14. In southern 
Europe, we estimated a similar increase of 8% (–7 to 22), 
but the posterior probability of an increase was 83·3%. In 
2010–14, the Latin American region as a whole presents the 
lowest intended birth rate in the world (36 [90% UI 29–41] 
per 1000 women aged 15–44 years; appendix p 43).
Abortion rates as estimated by Sedgh and colleagues6 
are shown in the appendix (p 44).
Discussion
Between 1990–94 and 2010–14, the global unintended 
pregnancy rate declined, and the magnitude of the 
decline and the extent to which this corresponded with 
a decrease in unintended births or abortions varied 
across geographical areas. In developing regions, the 
unintended birth rate fell while the abortion rate held 
steady, whereas in developed regions the abortion rate, 
but not the unintended birth rate, declined.
Developing regions saw a decline in the intended birth 
rate, which reflects the increasingly widespread desire 
for small families,23 as well as a decline in the unintended 
birth rate, which indicates that a growing proportion of

women and couples have been able to realise their 
fertility goals. These trends are probably due at least in 
part to family­planning programmes, which have led 
to an increase in the prevalence of contraception. The 
proportion of married women using a contraceptive 
method (modern or traditional) in developing countries 
increased 8 percentage points, from 54% to 62%, between 
1990 and 2014 (with most of the increase taking place in 
the first decade of this 25­year period).24 Additionally, 
among users of a contraceptive method, a growing 
proportion are using modern methods instead of 
traditional methods.25
However, because a growing proportion of women 
wish to avoid pregnancy, the percentage of married 
women in developing countries classified as having an 
unmet need for contraception fell by only 4 percentage 
points, from 16% in 1990 to 12% in 2014. Additionally, 
among users of modern methods, there has been a shift 
in some regions from permanent to reversible methods.25 
These factors can be expected to mitigate the impact of 
the increased prevalence of contraceptive use. The 
substantial decline in the unintended pregnancy rate in 
developing regions is thus particularly noteworthy. 
Potential causes of this decline, including changes in 
contraceptive 
method 
mix, 
contraceptive 
efficacy, 
women’s fecundity, and the timing and frequency of 
sexual activity, deserve further study.
The decline in the unintended pregnancy rate in 
developing regions from 1990 to 2014 did not coincide 
with a decline in the abortion rate;6 thus, the percentage 
of unintended pregnancies that end in abortion in this 
part of the world has increased. This finding might 
suggest that women who experience unintended 
pregnancies are increasingly motivated to avoid an 
unintended birth. It is also possible that improved access 
to safe abortion, such as through the knowledge and 
availability of misoprostol and other safe technologies, 
has made it possible for an increasing number of women 
to safely terminate an unintended pregnancy, rather than 
continue with an unintended birth.2
By contrast, while the abortion rate declined sub­
stantially in developed regions, the unintended birth rate 
remained similar. This could signal that women and 
couples have increasingly managed to avoid the 
unintended pregnancies that they are most strongly 
motivated to prevent, for example through the effective 
use of contraception. Although new regulatory restrictions 
might have impeded some women’s access to safe and 
legal abortion,26 these changes have taken place in just a 
few developed countries; evidence from the USA shows 
that abortion rates declined in states which did and did 
not institute new regulations.27
We find that the unintended pregnancy rate is higher, 
and that the proportion of unintended pregnancies that 
end in abortion is lower, in countries that prohibit 
abortion, than in countries which allow abortion on 
request. By contrast, unintended pregnancy rates are 
lower, and the proportion of unintended pregnancies 
that end in abortion is higher, in countries that allow 
abortion on request (table 4).18 As a result, abortion rates 
are similar in both groups of countries. Higher levels of 
unmet need for contraception contribute to the higher 
unintended pregnancy rates in countries in which 
abortion is prohibited, which in turn contribute to the 
similar abortion rates.18 In concert with the recent 
estimate that three­quarters of abortions are unsafe in 
countries which prohibit abortion, this suggests that a 
substantial number of women in such countries would 
benefit from improved access to contraceptive services 
and access to safe abortion and post­abortion care.2
The lower propensity to abort an unintended pregnancy 
in countries which prohibit abortion might follow from a 
number of factors. These might be settings where a 
woman’s or couple’s motivation to avoid an unintended 
birth is, on average, relatively weak. Women might also 
experience cultural barriers, social and personal stigma 
when considering terminating an unintended pregnancy, 
or concrete barriers to realising their reproductive 
preferences. Additionally, women might be deterred from 
terminating pregnancies by barriers to accessing a safe 
and legal procedure. Research on variation in these drivers 
of unintended fertility across settings is needed.
The Latin American region is the only region in which 
the percentage of births unintended increased substantially 
between 1990–94 and 2010–14. This is because, although 
the unintended birth rate in the Latin American region 
declined 19% (90% UI 6–30), the intended birth rate 
declined 40% (31–50). More research is needed to better 
understand global variation in childbearing preferences, 
decisions, and processes.
The estimates and the model on which they are based 
face a number of limitations. Data were not available 
for all countries, and some of the data came from non­
representative samples (appendix p 8); our model 
accounted for differences in data quality, and differences

across geographical areas in the quantity and quality of the 
data are reflected in wide UIs where the evidence base is 
weak. We incorporated all available data from the DHS 
and RHS and other published studies covering a 25­year 
period. In future analyses, inclusion of data from the 
Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys can be explored. Also, 
in order to make global estimates over a period of time, 
we employed a widely used, dichotomous definition 
of unintended pregnancy. But the intention status of 
pregnancies can fall on a spectrum, as reflected in the 
LMUP, and several studies explore the development of 
more nuanced measures of birth intention.12,13,28,29
Some details of the surveys varied. Estimates might 
be conservative for countries where the data were 
obtained from published studies in which birth 
intention was averaged over all births that occurred 
3–5 years before the date a woman was interviewed. 
Additionally, the DHS changed the way it asked 
about intention status of births, potentially inducing 
confusion between mistimed with unwanted births. 
As unintended pregnancies are the sum of these 
two quantities, this should not affect our results. 
However, to examine whether women are systematically 
less likely to report a birth as unintended with the new 
questioning approach (ie, because they did not realise 
that they should include mistimed births when 
answering the first question), we examined the trend in 
the reported percentage of births unintended across all 
countries where surveys had been done before and after 
this change in the line of questioning. We did not 
observe a consistent decline across countries in the 
proportion of unintended births.
We use the standard DHS definitions of unmet need 
and unintended births in constructing predictor and 
outcome variables, respectively, but these definitions do 
not perfectly align. Women are classified as having an 
unmet need if they wish to avoid pregnancy for at least 
2 years, but mistimed births are classified as unintended 
even if they were mistimed by less than 2 years.
We classified all abortions obtained by women with no 
need for contraception as intended pregnancies, and all 
abortions obtained by unmarried women as unintended 
pregnancies. 
Some 
misclassification 
might 
have 
occurred in both groups.
We assume that the proportion of pregnancies that end 
in miscarriage and stillbirth is relatively constant across 
populations. It has been suggested that miscarriage rates 
can be higher in disease­endemic areas, such as where 
HIV prevalence is high and malaria is endemic.20 
Sufficient empirical evidence on which to base an 
alternative approach is lacking, but if miscarriage rates are 
higher in some settings than estimated by our approach, 
the intended and unintended pregnancy rates in those 
settings would also be slightly higher than estimated.
This approach to estimating the incidence of unintended 
pregnancy represents a substantial improvement over the 
approach used previously. The Bayesian model allowed 
us to make formal inference, present UIs around the 
estimates, and examine the robustness of the results 
with validation exercises. It also allowed us to use 
additional data (such as data on the percentage of 
unintended births that were experienced by married 
women) and to incorporate information on the likely 
precision of the data inputs. Moreover, unlike previous 
estimates, we used women’s reports of the intention 
status of births that took place in the year before the 
survey, rather than the 3 or 5 years before the survey 
wherever possible. This approach reduced the potential 
for recall bias to influence our findings. Future research 
should be directed towards assessing these biases. Using 
Bayesian modelling, we were able to make better use of 
all available data to study global variation and trends. 
However, advanced statistical modelling does not 
substitute for regular collection of high­quality data. 
Wide UIs in some regions and time periods should 
motivate additional investment in data collection, 
particularly for abortion incidence, where data reliability 
is an increasing concern.2,6
Our estimates of unintended pregnancy for 2010–14 
are higher than the previous estimates for 2012. As these 
were estimated using qualitative inference, substantive 
conclusions cannot be drawn from a comparison of these 
studies. Our estimated time series is intended to replace 
all previous cross­sectional estimates.
As women and couples increasingly wish to have small 
families and to control the timing and spacing of their 
births, investments in health­care programmes and 
policies are needed to address the growing demand for 
family­planning services. However, even if all individuals 
and couples who wished to avoid pregnancy used a 
method of contraception, some unintended pregnancies 
would still occur, because contraceptive methods are 
imperfect and people do not always use them correctly 
and consistently. Thus, it will remain imperative to help 
couples manage the outcomes of unintended pregnancies 
in ways that optimise their health and wellbeing, 
including access to safe and legal abortion services. 
These investments are also necessary to achieve the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals, namely universal access 
for women and couples to sexual and reproductive health 
and reproductive rights.30
