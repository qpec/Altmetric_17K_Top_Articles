Drug Management Improvement Team (ADMIT)
BACKGROUND: Problems with the use of inhalers by patients were noted shortly after the
launch of the metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and persist today. We aimed to assess the most
common errors in inhaler use over the past 40 years in patients treated with MDIs or dry
powder inhalers (DPIs).
METHODS: A systematic search for articles reporting direct observation of inhaler technique
by trained personnel covered the period from 1975 to 2014. Outcomes were the nature and
frequencies of the three most common errors; the percentage of patients demonstrating
correct, acceptable, or poor technique; and variations in these outcomes over these 40 years
and when partitioned into years 1 to 20 and years 21 to 40. Analyses were conducted in
accordance with recommendations from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and
Meta-Analyses
and

in
Epidemiology.
RESULTS: Data were extracted from 144 articles reporting on a total number of 54,354
subjects performing 59,584 observed tests of technique. The most frequent MDI errors were
in coordination (45%; 95% CI, 41%-49%), speed and/or depth of inspiration (44%;
40%-47%), and no postinhalation breath-hold (46%; 42%-49%). Frequent DPI errors were
incorrect preparation in 29% (26%-33%), no full expiration before inhalation in 46%
(42%-50%), and no postinhalation breath-hold in 37% (33%-40%). The overall prevalence of
correct technique was 31% (28%-35%); of acceptable, 41% (36%-47%); and of poor,
31% (27%-36%). There were no significant differences between the first and second 20-year
periods of scrutiny.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorrect inhaler technique is unacceptably frequent and has not improved
over the past 40 years, pointing to an urgent need for new approaches to education and drug
delivery.

 Current clinical evidence suggests that although
contemporary inhaled therapy for asthma has the
potential to control disease in most patients,1,2 control
is often not achieved in practice. One prominent reason
for poor control is poor inhaler technique, because no
matter how good a drug is, it cannot be effective if it
does not reach the targeted airways.3,4
Problems with technique were recognized shortly after
the launch of pressurized metered-dose inhalers (MDIs)
in the 1960s,5 and later reports suggested that the
problems persisted despite elaborate initiatives to reduce
them.6-11 Initiatives trying to improve the situation have
included regular training programs for patients and
health-care professionals; printed instructional material,
videos, and software; and measures and devices to
make inhalation easier, such as the development of a
breath-actuated MDI (BAMDI) and an MDI with
inhalation chamber (MDIþIC); and the design of various
dry powder inhalers (DPIs) that require an easier
inhalation maneuver. A reasonable question that arises,
therefore, is to what extent these initiatives have improved
problems with inhaler technique over the past 4 decades.
We examined articles published between 1975 and 2014
in which inhaler technique demonstrated by patients
with asthma and COPD was assessed by trained
observers who classified the errors according to
established recommendations and then assessed the
overall technique as correct, acceptable, or poor. We also
documented the most common errors noted for each
inhaler type. Finally, we divided this 40-year period into
early and late periods of use and compared the outcome
variables to look for time trends.
Materials and Methods
Eligibility, Literature Search, and Selection Process
Full details of the protocol followed are available from http://www.crd.
york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID.CRD42014009347.
Data were extracted from papers assessing the extent and prevalence of
incorrect inhaler use in children (minimum age, 5 years) and adults
who were receiving inhaled therapy for either asthma or COPD.
Articles published in English, French, or Spanish between 1975 and
2014 were evaluated. To be included in the analysis, a study had to
meet the following criteria: (1) include an evaluation of inhaler use
and technique in its main objective, and (2) contain a description of
the assessments made that was based on direct observation of the
patients’ technique by trained personnel using an inhaler-specific
checklist of steps. The recommended maneuvers12-14 that had to be
observed directly and assessed are listed in Table 1. We classified
their assessments in rough groupings for analysis. We recorded
technique as correct if observers thought all maneuvers were
performed in accordance with the recommendations; acceptable (fair
or good but suboptimal) if observers thought roughly three-quarters
of the maneuvers were as recommended, including all critical
aspects; and poor or very poor if fewer than one-half of the
maneuvers were correct and/or one or more critical errors were
present. The concept of critical error refers to its influence on the
generation and lung deposition of aerosol rather than whatever
changes it might induce in terms of clinical or therapeutic effects.15
Papers providing insufficient information about the maneuvers were
excluded. If a study presented data on technique before and after an
educational or instructional intervention, we only extracted data
prior to the intervention.

inhalers and their use as follows: inhaler AND technique AND

Library for Medicines.11 The investigators’ own files were also
searched. Finally, we checked the reference list in each of the
selected articles to identify any studies that might have been missed.
Outcomes, Data, and Extraction Process
The outcomes of the study were (1) the type and prevalence of the
three most frequent errors observed in patients using the various
types
of
inhaler
(MDI,
BAMDI,
MDIþIC,
or
DPI);
(2)
the
percentage of patients demonstrating correct, acceptable, and poor
technique; and (3) changes in these two outcomes over time. For the
MDI, BAMDI, and MDIþIC, the first (early) period of use was from
1975 to 1995; the second (late) period was from 1996 to 2014. The
first and second periods for the DPI were from 1990 to 2002 and
from 2003 to 2014, respectively. Change in the percentage of patients
demonstrating correct, acceptable, or poor technique was also
assessed by using data for all device types and calculating the
averages of 5-year intervals over the 40 years of observations.
The following data were recorded from each selected article: author;
year of publication; setting (country); patient type (adult, $ 17 years
old or child $ 5 years old); type of inhaler; number of observed
tests of technique for a given inhaler type; percentage of tests with
each of the three most frequent errors with each inhaler type; and
percentage of technique tests classified as correct, acceptable, or
poor. Some of the studies evaluated inhalation technique with more
than one device by using the same subjects, whereas other studies
tested different subjects’ use of the different devices. For simplicity,
we will refer to individual tests and the percentages of observed
errors made by the tested individuals for each inhaler type.
Recording error reports from heterogeneous studies was complex
because some steps (especially step 1, preparation [Table 1]) had
various components and these in turn varied with each inhaler type.
Furthermore, some of these components were critical, whereas others
were less important. When a study reported errors in more than one
component in a step, only the frequency of the most important
component was tabulated in this review. Some aspects of technique
included by some investigators, such as waiting a specified amount
of time before the next inhalation or breathing out through the nose,
were not taken into account.
In an attempt to enhance recording consistency, a single experienced
investigator (J. S.) extracted the data. To reduce the likelihood that
this approach might result in errors that might have been detected if
two independent investigators extracted and compared data,16 the
same investigator repeated the procedure at a later date, blinded to
the results of the previous extraction. A second investigator (I. G.)
then independently compared the results of the two sets of data.
Disagreements between the two data collections, which were minor
and
quantitatively
did
not
change
the
overall
results,
were
nonetheless reassessed.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted in accordance with the recommendations of
the Cochrane Collaboration (Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews
of
Interventions,
version
5.1.0)17,
the
guidelines
for
Strengthening
the
Reporting
of

Studies
in
Epidemiology,18 and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.19 Data were recorded in a
bespoke spreadsheet and analyzed using StatsDirect (version 2.8.0;
http://www.statsdirect.com).
The prevalence—the pooled proportion from a set of weighted
proportions—of each error was calculated by means of meta-analysis
for each inhaler type. For each variable, the 95% CI was calculated
using the approximation of a binomial distribution.20 To determine
the use of a fixed or random effects model, we calculated the I2 index
as a measure of heterogeneity.21 Prevalences were analyzed to ascertain
which errors were the most frequent, the relative frequencies of these
errors, and the possible change in type and frequency over time. Given
the expectation of very great heterogeneity of data (confirmed in all
instances by the results of the I2 index, which ranged from 65.3 to
98.1), the random effects model was adopted for all variables.
Funnel plots were drawn, and Egger and Horbold-Egger tests were
computed to explore the possibility of publication bias.22 We also
conducted post hoc comparative (sensitivity) analyses of groups with
fewer or more than 50 observations of an individual’s technique per
device-type group.23
Results
Electronic searches yielded 3,695 articles related to
inhalation technique. After removal of duplicates and
unrelated articles, initial screening led to further
exclusions of articles contributing no new data or studies
not evaluating overall technique (Fig 1). Articles from
the authors’ own files and candidates from reference lists
were added before the reading of all candidates to check
eligibility criteria. This process yielded 144 articles
meeting all inclusion criteria.3,4,24-165 The selected
studies were performed in 31 countries; 37 came from
North America, 8 from Central or South America, 76
from Europe, 1 from Africa, 4 from the Middle East, 13
from Asia, and 5 from Australia or New Zealand. Fifty-
four studies reported data on patients with asthma, 14
on patients with COPD, and the remaining 76 on both
types of patients together or on patients with unspecified
airway disease. Eighty-one studies provided data on the
mean age of their adult subjects (53.6 years). Twenty-
five studies reported data on children (age < 18 years);
three of these studies also included groups of adults, and
22 enrolled only children. Seventeen of the latter
provided data on mean age (9.4 years). The inhalation
procedure test protocol checklists were not uniform
across studies, but they always included the steps
specified in Table 1 and quantified each error as a
percentage of the sample.
The 144 selected articles3,4,24-165 included data on
54,354 subjects and reported a total of 59,584 tests of
technique; the number of tests was higher because the
subjects in some studies were tested with more than one
device. Data were available for 286 groups (ie, subjects
tested with a single device) of varying sizes; the mean
(SD) number of subjects in each group was 208 (570),
with a median of 86 subjects. There were 112 groups,
396
Original Research
[ 1 5 0 # 2 C H E S T A U G U S T 2 0 1 6 ]
 with 23,720 tests with the MDI; 14 groups included
1,349 tests on children (5.7%). There were 12 groups,
with 10,833 tests with the BAMDI; two test groups
included 539 children (5.0%). The MDIþIC was tested
in 27 groups, with 2,432 tests; 11 of these groups
included 1,088 children (44.7%). Of the 130 groups
(21,497 tests) tested with the DPI, 15 groups included
1,472 children (6.8%). Thus, children accounted for
7.6% of all subjects tested with one device or another
(most often the MDIþIC). The remaining five groups,
with 1,100 patients, could not be assigned to a specific
device and, therefore, were not included in the analysis
of errors. However, their data on correct, acceptable, or
poor technique were entered into the overall analysis of
the inhalation maneuver.
The times each error appeared as one of most frequent
in each article and the estimates of the average
frequencies exhibited by all these errors with each type
of inhaler are shown in Table 2. We found very minor
differences between the results from the early and late
periods when we pooled the data for all devices. Given
the fact that children amounted to 44.7% of the subjects
tested with MDIþIC devices, we analyzed the results of
children and adults separately, finding lower error
frequencies in children (Table 2). The overall frequency
of correct, acceptable, and poor technique can be seen in
Table 3. When we looked at these frequencies for the full
40-year period, split into 5-year intervals, we saw no
appreciable time trends (Fig 2). The funnel plots showed
asymmetry in the data of MDI errors 2 and 4 and DPI
errors 1, 2, 4, and 5 (e-Appendix 1). The Egger and
Horbold-Egger tests were significant at P < .05 for these
same errors, indicating the presence of bias.
Relatively small studies (< 50 subjects per group)
accounted for 30.8% (88 out of 286) of all the studies.
The post hoc sensitivity analysis to explore the influence
of small studies showed that their effect on the general
results was relatively minor. The small groups generally
showed greater variability and slightly higher averages
for some of the errors, and the mean percentage of poor
technique was similar, at 32% (95% CI, 27%-40%) in the
small groups (n ¼ 32) and 30% (95% CI, 27%-36%) in
studies with larger groups (n ¼ 75) (Table 4).
Because complete data on all possible errors were not
presented in all 144 studies, we undertook a post hoc
analysis to test for the possibility that errors expected to
be most prevalent might be overestimated because they

 were somewhat lower than those reported in the sample
of groups from all studies (Table 2). Nevertheless, the
prevalence of MDI or BAMDI errors 2 to 5 and DPI
errors 2 and 5 remained > 30%.
Discussion
The main finding of this large, systematic review was a
high frequency of poor and/or suboptimal inhaler use
for all types of devices. The MDI had the highest average
frequency of errors (> 40% for steps 2-5). The lower
limits of the 95% CIs for errors with this device indicate
that even a conservative assessment of the prevalences
would be high. The prevalence estimates of DPI errors
were somewhat lower, but the preparation, full
expiration, and breath-hold maneuvers still had lower
limits of the 95% CIs $ 25%. Second, we saw no
indication that the problem of incorrect or suboptimal
use had diminished over the past 40 years, even though
considerable effort has been invested in education,
training, and device development. The marked diversity
in the populations, methodology, types of errors
measured, and data presentation of the studies we found
dissuaded us from undertaking extensive meta-analyses
of the data; however, we believe that the findings of
persistently high error rates are robust and clinically
important.
The high frequency of incorrect inhaler use and the
nature of the most common errors are in agreement
with the findings of earlier studies,3,6,9,10,166 despite our
focus on the five most important aspects of technique
rather than any or all mistakes, without considering
whether they affect the delivery of aerosolized drug to
the lung. We had expected that adding holding
chambers would reduce MDI errors substantially, but we
saw no evidence that this is the case (Table 2). Inhalation
chambers differ in shape and volume, and most of

Data are presented as mean percentage (95% CI). According to this analysis, one-third of subjects exhibited an inhalation technique that impaired the
arrival and/or deposition of aerosol in the lung. Comparison of the 1975-1995 and 1996-2014 intervals shows the stability of the percentage of poor
technique and some increase in the numbers of acceptable inhalation technique in the second period. The percentage of poor technique with MDI appears
to be clearly higher than that of DPI. See Table 1 legend for expansion of abbreviations.

Figure 2 – The figure shows the average of correct, acceptable, and poor tests over the 40 years of observation. Because not all studies included this
information, data were available for 94 groups. Inhaler technique was assessed by the authors of the included articles and considered correct by us when all
the steps were performed in agreement with the items listed in Table 1: acceptable when approximately 80% of those steps were correct and no critical error
was observed and poor when the researchers observed one or more critical errors and/or there were errors in more than 50% of the inhalation procedure
steps. The general impression is one of a stable distribution of averages because there are no major, significant changes in any of the three categories.

 them—but not all—are valved. Chambers are used
preferably for small children, the elderly, or physically or
mentally disabled adults. These varying circumstances
make it difficult to recommend a set of instructions for
their use that are as precise as the instructions for the
MDI or DPI. In the present study, we resorted to
summarizing the proper use of the MDIþIC in three
steps (Table 1). In addition, we note that we were able to
include relatively few studies for devices with chambers.
As a result, no firm conclusions can be drawn about
MDIþIC systems at this time, although their use seems
to be more problematic for adults, who made errors
more often than did children (Table 2). The inclusion of
studies with children adds to the heterogeneity of the
sum of studies we analyzed. Children represented
7.6% of the subjects overall, but they mainly participated
in MDIþIC studies, where they made up 44.7% of the
subjects tested.
We also expected DPIs to perform better and were
surprised that their error rates were only slightly lower
than MDI rates. More than one-third of patients using a

with < 50 subjects, in keeping with what is predicted in the literature22; however, the slow deep inspiration and breath-hold required for the MDI remained
similar. See Table 1 legend for expansion of abbreviations.

 DPI made errors—particularly in dose preparation,
expiration, and inspiration—that would reduce
drastically the delivery of drug to the lung15,81 (Table 2).
A separate analysis of errors made with the different
DPIs that have been developed over the past 30 years
would be very helpful, and it also would be instructive to
compare the results of such studies with reviews of
general, nonspecific data such as the present review.
However, our aim was limited to examining the impact
of all initiatives to attenuate problems with inhaler
technique, which were recognized even in the early years
of contemporary inhaled therapy.
The reasons for the high frequencies observed with all
inhaler types cannot be inferred from our analysis of the
144 studies we reviewed. Patients may have used their
inhaler for long periods since they last received
instruction, they may have received little or no
instruction, or they may have been instructed in busy
clinics and received less attention or follow-up than
patients seen in the context of a clinical trial. To our
knowledge, changes in the frequencies of incorrect
inhaler use over time have not been assessed
systematically before this. Our data on the time trend
(no improvement) was surprising but seemed to be quite
robust. Most authors emphasize the same strategies:
careful instruction,44,60 observation of inhalation
technique, and individual matching of inhaler and
patient. Training is facilitated by demonstration44,146
and repeated tuition,9,81,111 as well as by video
instructions, computer assistance, and written material.
Our data suggest that either these measures are
insufficient or training recommendations generally are
not implemented. More research is required not only to
address the issues of clinical effectiveness but also to
identify new and/or better approaches.
The observed marked diversity in study design,
population samples, assessments, and outcomes calls for a
widely accepted consensus on how and what to study of
this important aspect of real-life use of inhaler therapy in a
potentially life-threatening disease. The scarcity of usable
information in many articles led to the exclusion of more
than 69.2% (324 out of 468) of the candidate articles. The
combined problems of diversity and heterogeneity limited
our analysis to rough categories. If we do not standardize
our methods for studying technique, and cannot measure
patients’ inhaler use properly, it will continue to be
difficult to improve the situation in the future.
Conclusions
Incorrect inhaler use in patients with asthma and COPD
is unacceptably high outside clinical trials and does not
seem to have improved over the past 40 years. This may
be a major obstacle for achieving good asthma control.
New approaches to handling this important problem
should be explored. To facilitate comparisons of results,
future studies should be based on generally accepted
checklists of maneuvers that affect drug delivery. It
would be helpful to develop scores that quantify inhaler-
specific aspects of technique.
