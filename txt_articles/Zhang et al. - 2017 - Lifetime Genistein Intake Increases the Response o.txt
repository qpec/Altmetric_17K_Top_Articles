Abstract
Purpose: Whether it is safe for estrogen receptor–positive
(ERþ) patients with breast cancer to consume soy isoflavone
genistein remains controversial. We compared the effects of
genistein intake mimicking either Asian (lifetime) or Caucasian
(adulthood) intake patterns to that of starting its intake during
tamoxifen therapy using a preclinical model.
Experimental Design: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an
AIN93G diet supplemented with 0 (control diet) or 500 ppm
genistein from postnatal day 15 onward (lifetime genistein).
Mammary tumors were induced with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)
anthracene (DMBA), after which a group of control diet–fed rats
were switched to genistein diet (adult genistein). When the first
tumor in a rat reached 1.4 cm in diameter, tamoxifen was added to
the diet and a subset of previously only control diet–fed rats also
started genistein intake (post-diagnosis genistein).
Results: Lifetime genistein intake reduced de novo resistance to
tamoxifen, compared with post-diagnosis genistein groups. Risk
of recurrence was lower both in the lifetime and in the adult
genistein groups than in the post-diagnosis genistein group. We
observed downregulation of unfolded protein response (UPR)
and autophagy-related genes (GRP78, IRE1a, ATF4, and Beclin-1)
and genes linked to immunosuppression (TGFb and Foxp3) and
upregulation of cytotoxic T-cell marker CD8a in the tumors of the
lifetime genistein group, compared with controls, post-diagnosis,
and/or adult genistein groups.
Conclusions: Genistein intake mimicking Asian consumption
patterns improved response of mammary tumors to tamoxifen
therapy, and this effect was linked to reduced activity of UPR and
prosurvival autophagy signaling and increased antitumor immu-
nity. Clin Cancer Res; 23(3); 814–24. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
High soy food intake among women living in Asian countries is
thought to contribute to their low breast cancer risk (1, 2).
Soybeans contain the isoflavone genistein that has physicochem-
ical properties similar to 17b-estradiol (E2). Genistein activates
bothestrogenreceptorsERa and ERb ina manner comparablewith
E2 but with a lower affinity (3). Studies done using estrogen
receptor–positive (ERþ) human MCF-7 breast cancer cells indicate
that physiological doses of E2 or genistein stimulate the growth of
these cells in vitro and in vivo in athymic nude mice (4). Because
estrogenic compounds, including hormone replacement therapy,
are not recommended for patients with breast cancer, oncologists
often advise their patients not to take isoflavone supplements or to
consume soy foods (5). Also, genistein intake can reduce the
efficacy of both tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors in eliminating
breast cancer cells in athymic nude mice (6–8).
Studies in women show no evidence of adverse effects of soy
intake on breast cancer outcome (9). Indeed, patients with breast
cancer consuming more than 10 mg isoflavones daily, corre-
sponding to one third cup of soymilk, have the lowest risk
of recurrence, both among Caucasian and Asian populations
(10–12). The protective effect is seen in ERþ and ER� patients
with breast cancer (11, 12) and in patients treated with endocrine
therapy (12). However, it is unclear whether the protective effect
reflects high lifetime soy intake or whether a similar outcome can
be reached by starting soy intake for the first time during endo-
crine therapy.
Resistance to endocrine therapies is a significant problem in
treating ERþ breast cancers (13). While about 50% of ERþ
patients with breast cancer respond to tamoxifen, tumors can
either exhibit de novo resistance (never respond to the treatment)
or acquire resistance after initially responding and recur (14, 15).
Factors involved in determining which patients will respond to
endocrine therapy and which will recur remain largely unknown
(16, 17). Tamoxifen induces endoplasmic reticulum (EnR) stress
and the unfolded protein response (UPR); when prodeath sig-
naling dominates cancer cells are eliminated by apoptosis (16,
18). However, UPR which involves GRP78 as a key activator of the
process, and 3 signaling arms consisting of IRE1a, PERK, and
ATF6 pathways can also activate autophagy-related genes to
induce cancer cell survival. Earlier in vitro studies indicate that
genistein suppresses UPR signaling (19, 20), but as these findings

The UPR regulates inflammatory responses in antigen-present-
ing macrophages and dendritic cells (21). Specifically, activation of
UPR reduces antigen processing and presentation and consequent-
ly suppresses CD8þ cytotoxic T cells (22), leading to evasion of
antitumorimmunity(23).UPRactivationislinkedtoupregulation

includingincreasingCD8þ TcellsandreducingTregs(27).Because
high FOXP3 levels are predictive of poor survival among ERþ
patients with breast cancer (28, 29), genistein intake may promote
antitumor immunity and prevent recurrence.
More than 40 years ago, Jordan and colleagues (30) used 7,12-
dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) to induce ERþ mammary
tumors in rats and showed that these tumors stopped growing and
many disappeared when animals were treated with tamoxifen.
Using this same model, with some modifications (31), we com-
pared the effects of lifetime genistein exposure that mimics the soy
food intake of Asian women, with genistein intake starting during
adult life (mimicking soy food intake among some Western
women), or intake that began during tamoxifen treatment. Most
breast cancers in the United States likely fall into the latter
category, if patients start using soy supplements or soy foods to
alleviate menopausal symptoms induced by antiestrogens. Our
results show that either lifetime or adult genistein intake inhibits
tamoxifen resistance and reduces local mammary cancer recur-
rence. Starting to consume genistein during tamoxifen treatment
has the opposite effect. We also found changes in tumor UPR and
immune markers that are indicative of lower levels of EnR stress
and improved antitumor immune responses in the lifetime genis-
tein-exposed group.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Sixteen female Sprague-Dawley rats, each nursing ten 10-day-
old female pups, were obtained from Charles River Laboratory
(Frederick, MD) and housed in the Department of Comparative
Medicine at Georgetown University. Rats were kept in a temper-
ature- and humidity-controlled room with free access to water and
food under a 12:12-hour light:dark cycle. All experimental pro-
cedures were approved by Georgetown University Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Dietary exposures and DMBA administration
When pups were 15 days of age, 16 litters were divided into 2
groups: (i) 7 dams with a total of 70 female pups were fed AIN93G
laboratory diet supplemented with 500 ppm genistein (genistein
diet) and (ii) 9 dams with a total of 90 female pups were fed an
AIN93G diet (control diet). Pups were weaned on postnatal day
(PND) 21 and kept on the genistein or control diet until PND 30.
Between PND 31 and 55, all rats were fed the control diet to avoid
the potential effects of genistein on the metabolism and activation
of DMBA.
On PND 48, mammary tumors were initiated by administering
1 mL of peanut oil containing 10 mg DMBA by oral gavage. One
week later, rats were divided into 5 groups. (i) Those previously fed
genistein diet received 500 ppm genistein from PND 55 onward
until the end of the study (lifetime genistein group mimicking
Asian women; n ¼ 35). (ii) Those fed genistein between PNDs 15
and 30 received control diet until they developed mammary
tumors and started antiestrogen treatment. Once antiestrogen
treatment started, these rats were again fed 500 ppm genistein
(prepubertal genistein group; n ¼ 35). This group does not rep-
resent either Caucasian or Asian soy intake patterns; this group was
included as a control group for the lifelong genistein intake group.
(iii) Those animals previously fed control diet received 500 ppm
genistein from PND 55 onward until the end of the study (adult
genistein group mimicking Caucasian women; n ¼ 35). (iv) Rats
previously fed control diet remained in the control diet until they
developed mammary tumors and started antiestrogen treatment at
which point they were fed for the first time 500 ppm genistein
(antiestrogen treatmentonlygenistein group;n ¼ 20). Finally, (v)a
controlgroupcomposedofratskeptonthecontroldietthroughout
the study (control; n ¼ 15). This control group was not included to
assessing tumor responses to tamoxifen treatment. Instead, a
historical control group (31) was utilized to compare tumor
responses to tamoxifen. All the diets were provided by Harlan
Laboratories and the ingredients are listed in Supplementary Table
S1. Outline of dietary exposures are provided in Fig. 1.
To determine the effect of genistein intake on UPR, autophagy,
and immune parameters in the mammary tumors prior to anti-
estrogen treatment, we euthanized 15 rats per group when their
tumor reach a size of 14 � 1 mm in diameter.
Mammary tumor latency, incidence, and burden
Tumor latency was the length of the tumor-free period (in
weeks) from the date of DMBA administration until a rat devel-
oped the first measurable mammary tumor. Incidence was
assessed weekly and was defined as the percentage of animals
per group that had developed at least one tumor. Tumor burden
was the overall tumor area, calculated by measuring the width �
length of each tumor per animal, and was assessed when rats
started receiving antiestrogen treatment.
Antiestrogen treatment
Mammary tumor growth was monitored weekly by palpation,
and tumor locations and sizes (measured by a caliper) were
Translational Relevance
Because of its apparent estrogenicity, the safety of genistein
in soy foods for estrogen receptor–positive (ERþ) patients
with breast cancer who are treated with antiestrogen therapy
remains controversial. We show here using a preclinical rat
model that lifetime or adult genistein intake improved tamox-
ifen responsiveness and reduced the risk of recurrence, com-
pared with starting genistein intake during tamoxifen therapy.
The positive effects of lifetime genistein intake were linked to
reduced unfolded protein response and autophagy and
improved antitumor immune responses. If true for women,
our results suggest that patients with breast cancer should
continue consuming soy foods after diagnosis but not to start
if they have not consumed genistein previously.

 recorded. When a tumor reached a size of 14 � 1 mm in diameter,
a rat was switched to a diet containing 337 ppm tamoxifen citrate.
This dose results in a daily exposure of 15 mg/kg tamoxifen. The
response of the tumors to tamoxifen was assessed by the criteria
outlined in Supplementary Table S2.
Tissue collection
At the end of the tumor monitoring period, rats were eutha-
nized byCO2; earlier ifburden reached 10% of thebody weight, or
if animals lost weight or were sick, as required by the Georgetown
University Animal Care and Use Committee. At necropsy, blood
was collected by cardiac puncture, and mammary glands and
tumors were removed and flash-frozen in liquid N2 for future
analysis or were fixed in 10% formalin for histopathology
purpose.
Tumor pathologic evaluation
Formalin-fixed mammary tumors were embedded in paraffin
and cut into 5-mm sections. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-
stained tumor sections were used for the evaluation. Tumors were
classified according to their histopathology as evaluated by an
experienced pathologist (ARUP Laboratory). In all the molecular
biology assays done using mammary tumors, only tumors that
were malignant adenocarcinomas were included to the analysis.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
One hundred grams of frozen mammary tissue was ground
using a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was
isolated from the ground mammary glands by RNeasy Lipid
Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. Total RNA from malignant mammary tumors was extracted
using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) followed by one step of
DNase I treatment to prevent gDNA contamination (Roche), as
the manufacturer instructed. Quantity and quality of RNA were
determined according to the optical density ratio (OD260:OD280)
using a ND1000 Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scien-
tific). A total of 2 mg RNA per sample was used to generate cDNA
via reverse transcription in a PTC-100 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad)
using the following steps: initiation at 25�C for 10 minutes,
reverse transcription at 37�C for 2 hours, and deactivation at
85�C for 5 minutes.
Quantitative real-time PCR
To measure the relative mRNA abundance of UPR and
immune-related genes, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
was conducted. Briefly, 12.5 mg cDNA was used as template with
primers specific for PgR, Ki67, Tgfb1, Foxp3, Cd8a, spliced Xbp1
(Xbp1s), unspliced Xbp1 (Xbp1us), Hspa5 (GRP78), and Hprt using
5 mL Absolute QPCR SYBR Green ROX Mix in a 10 mL reac-
tion (Thermo Scientific). Serially diluted cDNA samples (20 to
0.625 ng/mL) were included with each primer. To determine the
relative quantity of the gene, the expression was normalized to
the level of the housekeeping gene Hprt. RT-PCR reactions were
carried out in an ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Life
Technologies) with the following thermocycler setting: activation
of the enzyme at 95�C for 15 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturing at
95�C for 15 seconds, annealing at 60�C for 30 seconds, and
elongation at 72�C for 30 seconds, followed by one step of
dissociation to ensure the purity of the product. Primers used in
the RT-PCR were designed using Vector NTI software (Life Tech-
nologies) and are listed in Supplementary Table S3. The result of
the reaction was checked and exported using SDS 2.3 software
(Life Technologies). The highest efficiency of the machine was
confirmed by ensuring that the R2 of the standard curve was >0.98
and that the slope was within 3.3 � 0.3.
Protein isolation and immunoblotting
Protein isolated from mammary glands and malignant tumors
was used to determine whether genistein intake and tamoxifen
treatment affected the expression of ERa, ERb, progesterone
receptor (PgR), Erb2/HER2, GRP78, IRE1a, XPB-1, sXBP-1, PERK,
ATF4, ChOP, ATF6, Beclin-1, ATG7, LC3I, LC3II, and p62.
Detailed description of the procedure and antibodies used can
be found in Supplementary Text.
Serum isoflavone quantification
Blood was drawn by cardiopuncture at necropsy and serum was
separated and kept at �80�C until analysis. Serum levels of total
isoflavone (aglycones and conjugated forms) were determined by
LC-ES/MS/MS. Briefly, complete enzymatic hydrolysis was per-
formed by incubating the serum samples overnight with Helix
pomatia preparation containing glucuronidase, sulfatase, and
glucosidase, followed by isotope dilution quantification of
Figure 1.
Study design. Rats were fed 0 or
500 ppm genistein (GEN)-containing
diet either before puberty, adult life or
both, or rats started consuming it for
the first time during tamoxifen (TAM)
treatment. Mammary tumors were
initiated with DMBA at PND 48, and
when a first tumor per rat reached a
size of 1.4 cm in diameter, 337 ppm
tamoxifen citrate (TAM) was added to
the diet. Response of tumors to TAM
was monitored for up to 38 weeks.

 genistein, daidzein, and equol. Inter- and intraday analysis was
performed, and the precisions of measurements were ensured
with 1% to 6% relative SD. For each sample, the method detection
limit for genistein was approximately 0.005 mmol/L per aliquot of
10 mL. Quality control samples were included for the analysis of
every sample test including the analysis of blank and spiked serum
samples (glucuronidase/sulfatase), blank injections, and injec-
tions of authentic standards.
Serum cytokine levels
To investigate possible changes in serum cytokine levels in rats
fed genistein at different times of their life, a rat cytokine multiplex
array (#110449RT) was carried out by Quansys Biosciences. This
analysis includes the following 9 cytokines: IL1a, IL1b, IL2, IL4,
IL6, IL10, IL12p70, IFNg, and TNFa. Serum was obtained from
rats that were euthanized before tamoxifen treatment. Samples
were run in triplicates using ELISA-based chemiluminescent assay,
and the mean value was calculated per animal to determine the
cytokine levels.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of the tumor latency, serum cytokine levels,
mRNA expression, and protein levels were performed using one-
way ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis using Fisher least
significant difference (LSD) test. If not otherwise specified, P
values given in Results represent those obtained from the LSD
test. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and the log-rank test were
used to compare the differences in tumor incidence. c2 analysis
was applied to determine the statistical significance in tumor
response to tamoxifen treatment and in the rate of recurrence
among the five groups. Repeated one-way ANOVA over each
tumor monitoring week was applied to the tumor burden data.
All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS SigmaStat
software, and differences were considered significant if P was less
than 0.05. Data are expressed as mean � SEM.
Results
We measured the serum genistein concentration by LC-ES/
MS/MS: they were 4.14 � 0.35 mmol/L in all of the genistein-
exposed groups and did not differ by the duration of genistein
intake. These levels are comparable with those seen in humans
consuming 2 to 4 servings of soyfoods daily (32). We did not
measure tamoxifen or its metabolite levels here. However, on
the basis of previously published study in Sprague-Dawley rats
receiving either 13.3 or 22.5 mg/kg/d of tamoxifen and having
blood tamoxifen levels of about 120 or 180 ng/mL, respectively
(33), we estimate that the levels in our study in rats consuming
15 m/kg/d tamoxifen were about 120 to 130 ng/mL. These
levels are comparable to those reported in breast cancer pati-
ents (�84 ng/mL) who took 20 mg of tamoxifen per day for
28 days (34).
Tumor latency and incidence
Lifelong genistein intake (10.9 � 0.8 weeks) significantly
delayed mammary tumorigenesis (P < 0.05), when compared
with control rats that never consumed genistein (7.9 � 0.3 weeks).
No significant differences were observed among the other groups
(Fig. 2A). Survival analysis revealed that the cumulative tumor
incidence in the lifelong genistein consumption group was sig-
nificantly lower than in the control rats (P ¼ 0.0071). Because
most animals in each group developed mammary tumors, tumor
incidence at the end of the study did not differ among the groups
(Fig. 2B).
Tumor responses to tamoxifen treatment and the risk of
recurrence
Responses to tamoxifen treatment were monitored for up to
30 weeks from DMBA administration; that is, until rats were
37 weeks of age. No difference in the length of the monitoring
period was seen among the groups (data not shown). Responses
(R) to tamoxifen in a historical non-genistein reference group
were seen among 54% of the tumors treated with tamoxifen
(ref. 31; Fig. 3A). Similar response rates were seen in rats that
consumed genistein during prepuberty (56%) or lifetime (52%).
These 2 groups exhibited a higher percentage of partially respond-
ing (PR) tumors; tumors that stopped growing upon tamoxifen
exposure, 21% and 24%, respectively, compared with the control
group (8%; P ¼ 0.007) (Fig. 3A). Consequently, de novo resistance
to tamoxifen was significantly lower in the prepubertal (23%)

(38%; P ¼ 0.03).
In comparison, tumors were least likely to exhibit a response in
rats that started consuming genistein either during tamoxifen
treatment (R ¼ 33%; P ¼ 0.004) or as adults (R ¼ 38%; P ¼
0.03) when compared with the reference control animals (P ¼

(P ¼ 0.01 or P ¼ 0.065), or group that consumed genistein during
prepuberty and tamoxifen treatment (P ¼ 0.002 and P ¼ 0.016).
In the adult genistein group, 21% of the tumors exhibited a
PR, and thus de novo resistance was not increased in this group
(Fig. 3A). De novo resistance in rats that started consuming
genistein during tamoxifen treatment was significantly higher
than in the prepubertal (P ¼ 0.032) and lifetime (P ¼ 0.047)
genistein groups.
The rats that started consuming genistein as adults had a
significantly higher tumor burden, and the rats that consumed
genistein during prepubertal period or lifetime had a significantly
lower tumor burden, compared with the reference group (repeat-
ed measures ANOVA: P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Tumors that exhibited a response and were undetectable for at
least 6 weeks, but then regrew at the same location to reach
�1.4 cm in diameter were characterized as recurring tumors with
acquired tamoxifen resistance. Prepubertal (11% recurrence
rate) and lifetime genistein intake (18% recurrence) decreased
the risk of tumor recurrence, when compared with rats that star-
ted consuming genistein with tamoxifen treatment (33% recur-
rence; P < 0.001; Fig. 3B). The risk of recurrence was lowest in
the rats that started genistein intake as adults (7% recurrence;
P ¼ 0.003, compared with the reference group).
Hormone receptor expression in the tamoxifen-treated

Western blotting was performed to determine the protein
expression of ERa, ERb, and HER2 in the mammary glands and

In the mammary gland, protein levels of ERa (Fig. 4A), ERb
(Fig. 4B), and HER2 (Fig. 4D) and mRNA level of PgR (Fig. 4C)
did not differ among groups. Tumors in tamoxifen-treated

 (Fig. 4F) or PgR (Fig. 4H) protein levels were not affected by
the different timings of genistein exposure. Protein levels of ERb

paredwiththegroupthat startedgenistein intakeduring tamoxifen

Tumor pathologic type
Histopathology of the mammary tumors was assessed before
and after tamoxifen treatment by examining H&E-stained tumor
sections. Results are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. No statis-
tical difference in tumor histopathology was seen in animals that
were euthanized prior to tamoxifen treatment. Nearly 0% to 27%
of the tumors were benign in the control and all genistein groups
and the remaining tumors were either papillary or tubular
adenocarcinomas.
Tumor histopathology was assessed after tamoxifen treatment
in partially responding, de novo resistant, or recurring mammary
tumors. Benign tumors constituted 23% of tumors in the controls,
27% in the rats that started to consume genistein during tamox-
ifen therapy, and 33% in the rats that consumed genistein during
adulthood. Prepubertal and lifetime genistein intake significantly
increased the rate of benign tumors in tamoxifen-treated rats to
53% (P < 0.001 compared with control group). Thus, because of
tamoxifen therapy, more than half of the partially responding or
growing tumors in these groups were no longer malignant.

 Alterations in UPR and autophagy signaling in the mammary
glands and tumors in tamoxifen -treated rats
Mammary glands. Tamoxifen did not affect UPR or autophagy
signaling in the DMBA-exposed mammary glands (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S4A and S4C–S4H). Consumption of genistein through-
out the lifetime increased GRP78 mRNA expression, compared
with the control rats (P < 0.001) or rats that started consuming
genistein during tamoxifen treatment (P ¼ 0.007). GRP78 mRNA
also was elevated in prepubertally genistein-fed rats, compared
with the same 2 groups (P < 0.001 or P ¼ 0.02). No other changes
in mRNA levels in UPR or autophagy genes were seen. At the
protein level, ATF6 was higher in the lifetime genistein group than
in the control (P ¼ 0.02) or adult genistein (P ¼ 0.01) rats, and
CHOP protein was higher in the lifetime group than in the adult
genistein rats (P ¼ 0.05; Fig. 5A, B, and D).
Because ATF6 acts as a transcription factor, we assessed the
mRNA levels of several ATF6 target genes. mRNA levels of total
Xbp1 were significantly higher in the lifetime (P ¼ 0.01) and
prepubertally genistein-fed rats (P ¼ 0.02) than in the control rats.
In addition, the ratio of spliced Xbp1 levels to total Xbp1 levels was
higher in the lifetime (P ¼ 0.02) and prepubertally genistein-fed
rats (P ¼ 0.01) than in the controls (Fig. 5C). These findings show
that in the mammary glands with no tumors, UPR was more
activated in those groups that received genistein already during
pubertal development, suggesting that upregulation of UPR may
be involved in protecting against mammary cancer development.
Mammary tumors. Consistent with the earlier studies showing that
tamoxifen activates UPR in breast cancer cell lines (18), we found
elevated protein levels of GRP78 (P ¼ 0.01) and IRE1a (P ¼ 0.05),

 when compared with tumors obtained from rats not treated with
tamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4I–S4N). We also noted
that Beclin-1 (P ¼ 0.05) protein levels were increased and p62
protein levels were reduced (P ¼ 0.02) in the tamoxifen-treated
tumors, indicative of higher level of autophagy. These findings are
in agreement with the reported effects of tamoxifen on human
breast cancer cell lines (18).
In contrast to the mammary glands, several UPR components
were significantly downregulated in the mammary tumors in rats
that consumed genistein throughout their lifetime. The down-
regulated genes included GRP78 (P < 0.001, compared with adult
genistein group), ATF4 (P ¼ 0.01, compared with control group),
and Beclin-1 (P ¼ 0.05 and P ¼ 0.001, compared with control and
adult genistein group, respectively; Fig. 5E–I). Because ATF4 and
Beclin-1 both induce autophagy (35), lifetime genistein intake
may promote higher responsiveness to tamoxifen therapy by
reducing autophagy.
Alterations in tumor immune system markers before and after
tamoxifen treatment
The mRNA level of tumor immune markers Tgfb1, Foxp3, and
Cd8a were determined in the mammary tumors from rats before
and after treatment with tamoxifen. Foxp3 is a member of the
forkhead-box transcription factor family and induces differenti-
ation of immature CD4þ T cells to CD4þCD25þ Tregs (36). Before
tamoxifen treatment, genistein consumption during childhood
(P ¼ 0.04), adulthood (P ¼ 0.005), or throughout lifetime (P ¼
0.02) reduced Foxp3 mRNA level, when compared with the
control rats (Fig. 6E). Tgfb1 increases differentiation of immature
T cells into Treg lineage, and Foxp3 induces its expression (37).
Tgfb1 mRNA levels in the mammary tumors were significantly
lower in all genistein groups than in the control group (P ¼ 0.05).
Genistein exposure tended to reduce Tgfb1 mRNA level in the
tumors of rats exposed during childhood and adulthood, but the
difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 6D). CD8 is

Foxp3 levels and increased Cd8a levels. Same endpoints were measured in tumors during TAM treatment (G–I) and this assessment included tumors from
rats that started GEN intake for the first time during TAM treatment (n ¼ 4–6 partially responding or de novo resistant adenocarcinomas per group). Lifelong
GEN intake reduced Foxp3 and increased Cd8a levels in TAM-treated rats. Data are presented as means � SEM; bars with different letters are significantly

 expressed in cytotoxic T cells. Lifelong genistein exposure increas-
ed mRNA level of Cd8a in tumors before tamoxifen treatment,
compared with control rats (P ¼ 0.03; Fig. 6F).
In tamoxifen -treated tumors, mRNA level of Tgfb1 did not
differ among the 5 groups (Fig. 6G). Lifelong genistein-fed rats
exhibited the lowest mRNA level of Foxp3 (P ¼ 0.05 compared
with rats starting to consume genistein with tamoxifen therapy)
and highest Cd8a (P ¼ 0.02, compared with controls; Fig. 6H and
I). Together, these findings suggest that lifetime genistein intake
prevents pathways leading to tumor immunosuppression and
promotes antitumor immune responses.
Alterations in circulating cytokine levels
Cytokine levels in serum were assessed by multiplex rat
cytokine arrays only before tamoxifen treatment. Thus, rats fed
a genistein-containing diet during adulthood and throughout
their lifetime were consuming this isoflavone at the time
cytokines were measured, unlike the control rats or rats that
received genistein before puberty. Of the 9 cytokines tested,
only IL1a, IL6, and IL12 had detectable levels in the rat serum.
Rats that consumed genistein prepubertally (but not at the time
the cytokines were assayed) had higher level of serum IL1a than
the control rats (P < 0.001; Fig. 6A). Serum IL6 levels also were
higher (P < 0.001) in this group than in the controls, whereas
the levels were significantly reduced in the group consuming
genistein during adulthood (P ¼ 0.04; Fig. 6B). IL12 levels
tended to be elevated in rats consuming genistein at the time of
measurements but the difference did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (Fig. 6C).
Proliferation and apoptosis in the tamoxifen -treated mammary
glands and tumors
To determine the level of cell proliferation, qRT-PCR was
carried out to test the relative mRNA level of Ki67 in the mammary
glands and tumors. This is a less time-consuming measure of cell
proliferation than assessing Ki67 though immunohistochemistry,
but equally accurate (38). In the mammary glands, mRNA levels
of Ki67 were higher in the rats consuming genistein prepubertally
than in the postdiagnosis genistein-fed rats (P ¼ 0.01) and control
rats (P ¼ 0.003; P for ANOVA ¼ 0.02; Supplementary Fig. S5A).
However, Ki67 levels in the adenocarcinomas did not differ
among the groups (Supplementary Fig. S5C).
Apoptosis was assessed by determining the ratio between the
protein levels of proapoptotic marker Bax and antiapoptotic
marker Bcl2 in the mammary glands and tamoxifen-treated
tumors. Neither the Bax nor Bcl-2 levels were different among
the groups (data not shown). The ratio between the 2 also was
similar in the glands (Supplementary Fig. S5B) and tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S5D) across all groups.
Discussion
In 2012, more than 1.67 million women were diagnosed with
breast cancer worldwide (39); about 70% of these patients had an
ERþ tumor. Although endocrine therapies are highly effective in
preventing and treating breast cancer (14, 15), approximately half
of the treated patients exhibit resistance and recur (13). In the
present study, by using a preclinical model of ERþ breast cancer,
we investigated whether genistein intake modifies responsiveness
to tamoxifen. Findings obtained in vitro and in immunodeficient
mice indicate that genistein impairs response to tamoxifen (6, 8),
but observational studies in patients with breast cancer show that
soy food intake is linked to reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence
(10–12). It is unclear how to explain these conflicting findings.
Because genistein does not alter the expression of tamoxifen-
metabolizing enzymes (40) nor is there any evidence that
increased estrogenicity impairs antiestrogen action, as tamoxifen
elevates circulating estrogen levels (41), the opposing effects of
genistein on human breast cancer cells in vitro or in vivo and on
patients with breast cancer are unlikely to reflect estrogenicity of
this isoflavone.
We found that lifelong genistein intake reduced the risk of de
novo and acquired tamoxifen resistance and local recurrence.
Similar results were seen in rats that consumed genistein before
puberty and again during tamoxifen therapy, suggesting that
genistein intake around puberty is critical in preventing tamox-
ifen resistance. These finding are consistent with childhood soy
intake in humans and prepubertal genistein exposure in animal
models reducing later breast cancer risk (42). Starting genistein
intake during adulthood did not interfere with the ability of
tamoxifen to inhibit the growth of rat mammary tumors and
was highly effective in preventing recurrence. In contrast to
lifetime genistein intake, rats that started consuming genistein
only when they were treated with tamoxifen exhibited an
increased risk of recurrence. Thus, genistein has a preventative
effect in tamoxifen-treated animals only if it is consumed
before tumors start to develop.
To identify pathways that may explain the differing effects of
lifetime genistein intake versus starting genistein consumption
during tamoxifen treatment, we focused on 3 interconnected
biologic systems. First, the effects on UPR and autophagy were
investigated, as these are causally linked to the development of
antiestrogen resistance (13, 16, 18). Earlier studies have reported
downregulation of GRP78 by genistein in prostate and liver cancer
cells (19, 20), but using pharmacologic doses that are not achiev-
able by isoflavone or soy intake in humans. In the tamoxifen-
treated mammary tumors, GRP78 expression was downregulated
in rats consuming genistein through their lifetime or during
prepuberty. ATF4 and Beclin-1 protein levels also were signifi-
cantly reduced in the tumors of lifetime genistein group, com-
pared with controls, indicating that autophagy may be reduced, as
these transcription factors both induce autophagy (35). Previous
results obtained in cancer cell lines in vitro indicated reduced
autophagy by physiological doses of genistein (43). The reduced
UPR and autophagy in the mammary tumors of rats consuming
genistein through their lifetime may be linked to their increased
sensitivity to tamoxifen therapy.
In the non–tumor-bearing mammary glands, GRP78 levels
were increased in rats consuming genistein through their lifetime,
as were the levels of CHOP and ATF6, and ATF60s downstream
target Xbp1. Thus, upregulation of UPR may be a successful
defense against malignant transformation. Upregulation of Xbp1
in Caenorhabditis elegans was recently found to confer a stress-
resistant phenotype and increased longevity (44), raising the
possibility that in mammary glands, elevated Xbp1 expression
also is linked to increased resistance to EnR stress.
Next, we studied whether genistein affects markers of cyto-
toxic T cells (CD8a) that drive antitumor immune responses,
and Tregs (Foxp3 and TGFb) that induce immunosuppression
and allow cancer cells to escape elimination by the immune
system (45, 46). ERþ mammary tumors in our model are
sensitive to immunomodulation.

 A previous study found that genistein did not prevent DMBA-
induced skin carcinogenesis in immunodeficient mice lacking T
lymphocytes, whereas in immunocompetent mice, genistein
reduced cancer growth; however, this protective effect was seen
only if genistein was given prior to tumor induction (27). These
mice, but not those receiving genistein after tumors were detected,
exhibited increased activity of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer
(NK) cells and decreased presence of Tregs in the spleen (27).
Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are produced by immune
cells and they have a profound influence on the development and
function of T lymphocytes. Serum IL12 levels were nonsignifi-
cantly increased in rats consuming genistein at the time of
measurement (lifetime and adult genistein intake groups), com-
pared with control or prepubertal genistein groups. However,
tumor-bearing rats fed genistein during prepuberty, but not at the
time the cytokine panel was assessed, had significantly higher
serum levels of IL1a and IL6 than control rats. Because IL1a or IL6
both can attenuate Treg function (47), these changes may explain
the reduced expression of Foxp3 in the mammary tumors of
prepubertally genistein-fed rats. Lifetime genistein intake did not
modify the levels of either IL1a or IL6, suggesting that the
presence of genistein reversed the increase in cytokine levels
caused by prepubertal genistein intake. This is supported by the
finding that adult genistein intake significantly reduced IL6 levels,
in accordance with findings reported by others (48).
In summary, we used a validated preclinical model of ERþ
breast cancer to study the response of tumors to tamoxifen in rats
that were fed genistein. Our results show that prepubertal and
lifetime genistein consumption improved responsiveness to
tamoxifen, indicating that improved response to endocrine ther-
apy was preprogrammed early in life. Furthermore, adult genis-
tein intake almost completely eliminated local recurrences. How-
ever, animals that received genistein only during tamoxifen treat-
ment were at an increased risk of recurrence. Because no
changes in tumor ERa or PgR levels were seen in any genistein
group, the differences cannot be caused by alterations in hormone
receptor expression. Rather, we found reductions in tumor UPR
and autophagy signaling and markers of tumor immunoevasion
in the lifetime genistein intake group. Although translation of
findings from animal models to humans should always be done
with caution, our results suggest that it is beneficial to continue to
consume soy foods after diagnosis to reduce tamoxifen resistance
and breast cancer recurrence.
