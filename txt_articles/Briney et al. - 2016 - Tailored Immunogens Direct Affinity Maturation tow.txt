SUMMARY
Induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs)
is a primary goal of HIV vaccine development.
VRC01-class bnAbs are important vaccine leads
because their precursor B cells targeted by an engi-
neered priming immunogen are relatively common
among
humans.
This
priming
immunogen
has
demonstrated the ability to initiate a bnAb response
in animal models, but recall and maturation toward
bnAb development has not been shown. Here, we
report the development of boosting immunogens de-
signed to guide the genetic and functional matura-
tion of previously primed VRC01-class precursors.
Boosting a transgenic mouse model expressing
germline VRC01 heavy chains produced broad
neutralization of near-native isolates (N276A) and
weak neutralization of fully native HIV. Functional
and genetic characteristics indicate that the boosted
mAbs are consistent with partially mature VRC01-
class antibodies and place them on a maturation
trajectory that leads toward mature VRC01-class
bnAbs. The results show how reductionist sequential
immunization can guide maturation of HIV bnAb
responses.
INTRODUCTION
Elicitation of a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) response is
thought to be a highly desirable feature of an effective HIV vac-
cine (Burton et al., 2005; Pantaleo and Koup, 2004). Passive
transfer of bnAbs to non-human primates (NHPs) can provide
sterilizing protection against challenge by chimeric simian/
human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs). Thus, it is widely ex-
pected that vaccine induction of sustained titers of potent bnAbs
would protect humans against diverse HIV strains (Burton and
Hangartner, 2016; Mascola and Haynes, 2013).
Several major challenges must be overcome to meet this goal.
First, potent bnAbs targeting relatively conserved epitopes on
the HIV envelope (Env) trimer develop in only a minority of in-
fected individuals, whereas narrowly neutralizing Abs targeting
variable epitopes on the infecting virus develop in all or most
cases of infection (Richman et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2003).
Furthermore, bnAbs have not been induced by vaccination in
humans or standard animal models, while strain-specific neutral-
izing antibodies have been induced by vaccination with native-
like trimers (Hessell et al., 2016; Sanders et al., 2015). Thus, elic-
itation of bnAbs will likely require strategies to focus responses
to relatively conserved epitopes and may also require suppres-
sion of responses to variable epitopes. Second, bnAb inferred-
germline precursors are generally not broadly cross-reactive
to wild-type Env proteins: such precursors typically show no
detectable affinity for wild-type Env proteins tested (Hoot et al.,
2013; Jardine et al., 2013; McGuire et al., 2013; Pancera et al.,
2010; Scheid et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010)
or bind to one or a limited number of Env proteins (Andrabi
et al., 2015; Bhiman et al., 2015; Doria-Rose et al., 2014; Gorman
et al., 2016; Haynes et al., 2012; Liao et al., 2013). Thus, elicita-
tion of responses similar to known bnAbs will likely require
‘‘germline-targeting’’ priming immunogens specifically designed
or selected for their ability to activate the appropriate precursor B
cells (Andrabi et al., 2015; Bhiman et al., 2015; Dimitrov, 2010;
Doria-Rose et al., 2014; Gorman et al., 2016; Haynes et al.,
2012; Jardine et al., 2013, 2015, 2016a; Liao et al., 2013; Ma
et al., 2011; McGuire et al., 2013, 2014, 2016; Pancera et al.,
2010; Xiao et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010). Third, although HIV
bnAbs target several different epitopes and use a variety of

 germline segments, all known bnAbs share one or more unusual
genetic features: very long heavy-chain CDR3 loops; short light-
chain CDR3 loops; and a high level of somatic hypermutation
(SHM), including SHM-associated insertions or deletions (indels)
(Doria-Rose et al., 2014; Falkowska et al., 2014; Kepler et al.,
2014; Liao et al., 2013; Pancera et al., 2014; Scharf et al.,
2014; Scheid et al., 2011; Sok et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2009,
2011; Wu et al., 2010). The high level of SHM in most bnAbs in-
dicates a protracted maturation process in which memory B cells
undergo multiple rounds of stimulation and affinity maturation
driven by constantly mutating Env. Induction of highly mutated,
broadly reactive antibodies by vaccination will likely require a
multi-step immunization strategy in which successive distinct
boosting immunogens follow a germline-targeting prime to drive
antibody maturation toward a broadly neutralizing phenotype
(Dimitrov, 2010; Haynes et al., 2012; Jardine et al., 2013, 2015,
2016b; McGuire et al., 2013; Pancera et al., 2010; Zhou et al.,
2010).
VRC01-class bnAbs targeting the CD4 binding site (CD4bs)
on HIV Env are attractive leads for HIV vaccine design, as
they are among the most broad and potently neutralizing (Mas-
cola and Haynes, 2013; Scheid et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010,
2011) and they can protect against infection in NHPs (Pegu
et al., 2014; Rudicell et al., 2014; Shingai et al., 2013) and sup-
press viremia in NHPs (Barouch et al., 2013; Shingai et al.,
2013) and humans (Caskey et al., 2015). VRC01-class bnAbs
derive from VH1-2 alleles present in �96% of humans and
encode an unusually short (five amino acid) light-chain CDR3
loop, providing a well-defined germline target for an engineered
priming immunogen (Jardine et al., 2013; McGuire et al., 2013).
One such immunogen, eOD-GT8 60-mer, has been shown to
target true human naive VRC01-class precursors at a frequency
of 1 in 400,000 to 2.4 million naive human B cells, correspond-
ing to 15 to 90 precursors per resting human lymph node (Jar-
dine et al., 2016a). Thus VRC01-class bnAb precursors are
abundant in humans, and we have at least one immunogen to
target them.
We recently demonstrated that eOD-GT8 60-mer immuniza-
tion primes relatively rare VRC01-class precursors in a trans-
genic mouse model expressing the VRC01 germline-reverted
heavy chain (VRC01 gH) (Jardine et al., 2015). In this heterozy-
gous knockin mouse model, �85% of the B cells express the
VRC01 gH chain paired with diverse mouse light chains, while
�15% of the B cells express diverse mouse heavy and light
chains. Owing largely to the low frequency of mouse light chains
with a 5AA CDR3 loop (�0.1%), the frequency of VRC01-class
precursors in the VRC01 gH mouse is estimated to be only
�5-fold higher than in humans. Furthermore, in contrast to ho-
mozygous knockin mice, the VRC01 gH mouse imposes compe-
tition from diverse mouse B cell specificities that is reduced by a
factor of only seven relative to a normal mouse. Despite these
challenges, we found that a single immunization of eOD-GT8
60-mer in the VRC01 gH mouse resulted in activation of B cells
encoding antibodies with VRC01-class genetic features, induc-
tion of specific somatic mutations shared with mature VRC01-
class bnAbs, and production of mutated VRC01-class memory
B cells with at least weak affinity for potential boost immuno-
gens. As expected, although a subset of GT8-specific mono-
clonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from memory-phenotype
B cells in immunized VRC01 gH mice showed weak cross-reac-
tivity to near-native Env, none of the mAbs acquired neutralizing
activity (Jardine et al., 2015). The VRC01 gH mouse is thus
an attractive model to evaluate boosting strategies to induce
VRC01-class bnAbs following an eOD-GT8 60-mer prime, and
the results in this mouse should have potential relevance to
human vaccination.
Based on structure-function studies of VRC01-class bnAbs
(Diskin et al., 2011, 2013; Georgiev et al., 2014; Jardine et al.,
2016b; Lyumkis et al., 2013; West et al., 2012; Zhou et al.,
2010, 2013), we have formulated a working-concept sequential
immunization strategy for how to induce VRC01-class bnAbs
(Jardine et al., 2016b). The strategy proposes a sequence of
four types of immunogens, each with specific objectives for af-
finity maturation: (1) germline-targeting nanoparticles, to activate
VRC01-class germline precursors and select sufficient VRC01-
class mutations for low-affinity recognition of N276(�) Env lack-
ing the N276 glycosylation site; (2) native-like N276(�) trimers, to
select mutations that enable neutralization of N276(�) viruses; (3)
native-like N276(+) trimers produced in GnTI�/� cells (or insect
cells) to present oligomannose glycans, for selection of light-
chain CDR1 mutations and/or deletions to accommodate the
base of the N276 glycan and to allow neutralization of viruses
passaged in GnTI�/� cells; and (4) native-like trimers bearing
native glycans, for selection of light-chain FW3 mutations to
accommodate the distal portions of the N276 glycan and to allow
neutralization of viruses bearing native glycans.
In the present work, we focused on the first two steps of this
strategy. We hypothesized that the eOD-GT8 60-mer prime
might fail to generate memory B cells capable of being activated
by native-like N276(�) trimers. Supporting this hypothesis, mAbs
induced by eOD-GT8 60-mer in the VRC01 gH mouse showed
affinity for an N276(�) core gp120 (Jardine et al., 2015) but not
for native-like N276(�) trimers (not shown). Thus, we sought to
develop immunogens that could serve as a bridge between the
eOD-GT8 60-mer prime and near-native N276(�) trimers.
We report the development and testing of two such boosting
immunogens, BG505 core-GT3 nanoparticle (NP) and BG505
SOSIP-GT3 trimer. We show that sequential immunization
schemes employing these bridging boost immunogens drove
the maturation of eOD-GT8 60-mer primed B cells toward
VRC01-class bnAbs and induced broad neutralization of near-
native (N276A) viruses and weak neutralization of a fully native
virus in VRC01 gH mice. The results demonstrate that reduc-
tionist sequential immunization can initiate and guide maturation
of pre-defined neutralizing antibody specificities. Furthermore,
our findings provide a foundation on which to develop a vaccine
to induce VRC01-class bnAbs.
RESULTS
Engineering a Boosting Immunogen to Follow eOD-GT8
60-mer Priming of VRC01-Class Abs
We sought to develop a boost immunogen to activate eOD-GT8
60-mer-induced memory B cells, cause the formation of new
germinal centers, and select for a pool of more highly mutated
memory B cells that could subsequently be boosted by
1460

 native-like N276(�) trimers. To achieve this goal, we designed
‘‘bridging’’ molecules, which, while still germline-targeting,
display a more native CD4bs epitope in order to drive maturation
toward mature VRC01-class bnAbs. We allowed fewer overall
mutations than in eOD-GT8 while retaining native VRC01-class
contact residues wherever possible. Engineered mutations at
non-contact positions were selected to improve affinity for germ-
line-reverted (GLrev) Abs via conformational stabilization or
removal of occluding glycans (Figure 1A). Two design platforms
were chosen: core gp120 and SOSIP native-like trimer. The core
gp120 platform was selected as an intermediate presentation of
the CD4bs, in terms of epitope completeness and steric restric-
tion, between the minimal eOD and the native-like trimer; use of
core gp120 would also minimize boosting of off-target re-
sponses, as core gp120 shares little exposed, non-glycosylated
surface with eOD or the native-like trimer beyond the CD4bs
epitope (Figure 1B) (Jardine et al., 2013, 2015; McGuire et al.,
2014, 2016). The SOSIP trimer platform was used to test the ef-
fect of including more native-like epitope and steric access re-
strictions in this bridging boost immunogen. The BG505 strain
was selected for both core gp120 and SOSIP platforms, primarily
for the purpose of conserving T-help with the subsequent boost
of BG505 SOSIP N276D (Figure 1C), although changing to
BG505 from the HXB2 strain used as the base strain for eOD-
GT8 was also considered potentially advantageous for mini-
mizing off-target responses (Figure 1B). To conserve T-help
with the eOD-GT8 60-mer prime, we planned to display the
core-gp120 on the same nanoparticle (lumazine synthase) as
eOD-GT8 (Jardine et al., 2013, 2015), thus using the underlying
nanoparticle for conserved T-help. For the trimer platform, we
added an exogenous T-help epitope (PADRE) (Alexander et al.,
1994, 1998) to the C terminus of both the eOD-GT8 60-mer prime
and the SOSIP boost (Figure 1C).
Protein engineering was initially carried out by yeast display
directed evolution on the core gp120 platform. We generated
combinatorial libraries of core BG505 gp120 containing muta-
tions that we had previously noted in the development of core
BaL-GT1 and eOD-GT8 (Jardine et al., 2013, 2016a). These
libraries were displayed on yeast and screened for binding to a
panel of GLrev VRC01-class mAbs. Three rounds of optimization
resulted in BG505 core-GT3 (Figure S1), a construct with modest
affinity for GLrev VRC01-class Abs (Figure 1D). Unlike eOD-GT8,
which displayed similar affinity for both GLrev and mature
VRC01-class mAbs (Jardine et al., 2016a), BG505 core-GT3
bound VRC01-class bnAbs with >1,000-fold higher affinity than
their GLrev counterparts. Thus, BG505 core-GT3 displayed a
strong affinity gradient for mature bnAbs over GLrev Abs and
was therefore promising as a boost to select productive somatic
hypermutation (Figure 1D). We produced nanoparticles of
BG505 core-GT3 by genetic fusion to lumazine synthase, as pre-
viously reported for eOD-GT6 and eOD-GT8 (Jardine et al., 2013,
2015). However, to accommodate the larger core-gp120, nano-
particles included �20 mol% ‘‘naked’’ lumazine synthase. Thus,
we estimate that there were �48 copies of core-GT3 displayed
on the nanoparticles. BG505 core-GT3 nanoparticles (NPs) dis-
played approximately the expected molecular weight in solution,
according to SECMALS analysis, and maintained antigenicity for
GLrev VRC01-class Abs (Figure S2).
To generate a native-like trimer variant of GT3 with more
native-like epitope features and CD4bs steric access restric-
tions, we transferred the BG505 core-GT3 mutations onto
BG505.D664 SOSIP and added a C-terminal PADRE epitope, re-
sulting in BG505 SOSIP-GT3-PADRE, from now on referred to as
BG505 SOSIP-GT3 (Figure S1). Overall, BG505 SOSIP-GT3 was
trimeric by SECMALS and showed an antigenic profile similar to
BG505 SOSIP.D664, with the added ability to bind VRC01-class
GLrev Abs and with a similar VRC01-class affinity gradient as for
BG505 core-GT3 (Figure S3). The melting temperatures of
BG505-SOSIP-GT3 (66.3�C) and BG505 SOSIP.D664 (66.7�C),
were similar. By negative-stain EM analysis, BG505 SOSIP-
GT3 was indistinguishable from BG505 SOSIP.D664 (Figure S3).
Thus, to develop a sequential immunization scheme with con-
siderations of gradual epitope change toward a native config-
uration, T-help conservation, and minimizing the boosting of
off-target responses, two boost candidates were designed to
follow the eOD-GT8 60-mer and precede the BG505 SOSIP
N276D native-like trimer.
Prime and Boosting of VRC01-gH Mice
To quantify the ability of BG505 core-GT3 NP and BG505
SOSIP-GT3 to recall VRC01-class precursor B cells primed
with eOD-GT8 60-mer, we sequentially immunized the VRC01
gH mouse with eOD-GT8 60-mer, BG505 core-GT3 NP, and
BG505 SOSIP N276D trimer according to the immunization
schedule described in Figure 2A. Twenty VRC01 gH mice were
primed with eOD-GT8 60-mer prime followed by either BG505
core-GT3 NP or BG505 SOSIP-GT3 boost. Eight mice were
sacrificed following the initial boost, while 12 mice (six boosted
with core-GT3 NP and six boosted with SOSIP-GT3) received
two additional boosting immunizations of BG505 SOSIP N276D.
For a serological probe, we developed a resurfaced HXB2
core gp120 (r1-core-N276D) with improved VRC01-class anti-
genicity compared to RSC3 (Wu et al., 2010) (Figure S4). The
resurfacing should minimize the binding of antibodies induced
by our immunization protocol against epitopes other than the
VRC01-class epitope. A VRC01-class epitope knockout variant
(r1-core-KO) with substantially depressed affinities for VRC01-
class bnAbs was also engineered, by adding the mutations
D368R and N279A in the CD4bs (Li et al., 2007, 2011).
Following the third boost, we evaluated serum antibody bind-
ing to r1-core-N276D and r1-core-KO (Figures 2B and S5). Areas
under the curve (AUC) were calculated for each serum sample,
and the differences in AUC between r1-core-N276D and
r1-core-KO are shown in Figure 2B. Although there was substan-
tial intragroup variation, the greatest differential was observed
for BG505 core-GT3 NP delivered with Ribi adjuvant. Similar
epitope-specific serum responses were seen in mice boosted
with BG505 core-GT3 NP without adjuvant and BG505 SOSIP-
GT3 delivered with Ribi adjuvant. In contrast, BG505 SOSIP-
GT3 delivered without adjuvant produced relatively modest
responses and the smallest difference in reactivity between r1-
core-N276D and r1-core-KO.
These differences in serum antibody responses were mirrored
in the frequencies of epitope-specific memory B cells. Spleno-
cytes and lymph nodes from immunized animals were harvested
and stained for IgG memory B cells. Single cells were then

 antigen-sorted by flow cytometry using the baits listed in Figures
2C and 2D. When comparing IgG memory B cell frequencies
following the first boost, BG505 core-GT3 NP delivered in Ribi
adjuvant showed the highest frequency of epitope-specific
memory B cells (Figure 2C). The same group showed the highest
frequency of epitope-specific memory B cells upon completion
of the full boosting schedule (Figure 2D).
Selection of Productive Mutations with Boosting
To determine whether consecutive boosting with tailored immu-
nogens selects for productive mutations, we divided the immu-
nized VRC01 gH mice into two test groups: (1) mice that received
only the eOD-GT8 60-mer prime and a single boost of BG505
GT3 (either SOSIP or NP), and (2) mice that received the com-
plete immunization protocol outlined in Figure 2A (with either
GT3 SOSIP or NP as the initial boost). We also analyzed four con-
trol groups of VRC01-gH mice that received the following regi-
mens: (1) a single immunization of eOD-GT8 60-mer, (2) three
successive immunizations of eOD-GT8 60-mer, (3) a single prim-
ing immunization of BG505 core-GT3 NP, and (4) a single priming
immunization of BG505 SOSIP-GT3. Overall, we recovered 681
heavy-chain sequences, 753 light-chain sequences, and 430
paired heavy-light-chain sequences. In animals primed with
eOD-GT8 60-mer, the majority of paired sequences were
VRC01-like (defined as using VH1-2 and encoding a 5AA
LCDR3) (Figure 3A). In contrast, only one of seven mice primed
with BG505-GT3 (either SOSIP or NP) generated VRC01-like an-
tibodies, demonstrating the necessity of a high-affinity germline-
targeting prime (Figure 3A). Although single or multiple immuni-
zations with eOD-GT8 60-mer alone failed to induce substantial
SHM, heterologous boosting resulted in significantly mutated
antibody sequences, with the most mutated heavy-chain
sequence containing 17 amino acid mutations (17.3%) and a
mean amino-acid mutation frequency of 8.6% in mice that
were primed with eOD-GT8 60-mer and boosted with BG505
GT3 and twice with BG505 SOSIP N276A (Figures 3B and 3C).
We next examined whether vaccine-induced SHM was pro-
gressing toward mature VRC01. For each VH1-2 sequence, we
determined the total number of amino-acid mutations and
the number of amino-acid mutations shared with a panel of
VRC01-class
mAbs
(VRC01,
PGV04,
PGV20,
VRC-CH31,
3BNC60, and 12A12) (Jardine et al., 2015) (Figure 3D). In order
to compare the observed frequency of shared VRC01-class
mutations to the frequency expected by random SHM, we per-
formed extremely deep antibody repertoire sequencing on two
healthy HIV-naive individuals and used that information to
compute the frequency of randomly incorporated VRC01-class
mutations in human VH1-2 antibody sequences (Figure 3D). In
animals given a single or triple immunization of eOD-GT8
60-mer alone, the frequency of VRC01-class mutations was
similar to that expected by chance. This finding was anticipated,
because eOD-GT8 has similar affinity for GLrev and mature
VRC01-class antibodies (Jardine et al., 2016a) and likely places
minimal selective pressure on the incorporation of VRC01-class
mutations. In animals boosted with more native-like immuno-
gens, however, VRC01-class mutations were selected much
more frequently than would be expected by chance: 126 of
130 VRC01-like heavy/light-chain paired antibody sequences
from animals boosted with GT3 and SOSIP N276A (2x) incorpo-
rated VRC01-class mutations at a frequency higher than the
calculated 95% confidence interval of random SHM. The step-
wise increase in SHM after each boost and the general failure
of GT3 to prime VRC01-class responses suggested efficient
recall of previously stimulated responses rather than recruitment
of primarily naive B cells upon each boost.
We also interrogated vaccine-elicited light chains for evidence
of maturation toward mature VRC01. This analysis is less straight-
forward than with heavy chains, because the light chains were
derived from mouse germline genes that would not be expected
to follow the same maturation pathway as human VRC01-class
light chains. Instead, we assessed two critical features: the distri-
bution of LCDR1 lengths and sequence convergence in LCDR3.
VRC01-class bnAbs encode relatively short LCDR1 loops (2AA–
8AA) by utilizing germline variable genes with short (6AA–8AA)
LCDR1s and in some cases with further shortening by SHM-asso-
ciated deletions (Table S3) (West et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2013).
Although indels are relatively rare (Briney et al., 2012a; Jardine
et al., 2016b) and likely will be difficult to elicit consistently by
vaccination (Jardine et al., 2016b), we were keenly interested in
whether sequential immunization could select antibodies with
short LCDR1s. Mice at all stages of the immunization program
had VRC01-like antibodies encoding 6AA LCDR1s (Figure 3G),
accomplished through the use of a variety of light-chain genes
with germline-encoded short LCDR1s (Figure 3H). We also noted
strong sequence convergence of immunogen-elicited antibodies
on a critical glutamate residue (Glu96) found in LCDR3 of VRC01
and most other VRC01-class bnAbs (Figure 3I) (West et al.,
2012; Zhou et al., 2015). While Glu96 was rarely present in light
chains recovered from GT8-primed mice (3%), the frequency
increased upon successive boosts, and every antibody recovered
from mice primed with GT8 and boosted with GT3 and SOSIP
N276D (2x) contained the critical LCDR3 glutamate. Therefore,
mirroringthedataobtainedfromheavy-chain sequences,sequen-
tial boosting successfully recalled primed VRC01-like precursors
and selected for the incorporation of specific genetic features
that evolved light chains toward VRC01-class bnAbs.

 Broad Serum Neutralization of N276A Viruses
Following immunization, purified serum IgG from each of the 12
mice receiving the entire immunization schedule was screened
on an 8-virus cross-clade indicator panel of near-native
(N276A) HIV isolates (Figure 4A). Ten of the 12 mice demon-
strated neutralization of at least one heterologous near-native
isolate, and six of the mice developed cross-clade neutralization.
Five of six mice boosted with BG505 core-GT3 60-mer devel-
oped cross-clade neutralization compared to three of six mice
boosted with BG505 SOSIP-GT3. Interestingly, although all
boosting immunogens were derived from BG505, only two
mice acquired detectable neutralizing activity against BG505
N276D. Although five of six animals boosted with BG505 GT3
NP developed cross-clade neutralization compared to only two
of six animals immunized with BG505 SOSIP-GT3, the two
animals that exhibited the broadest neutralization were both
boosted with BG505 SOSIP-GT3.
To verify the results of the first immunization experiment, we
performed a repeat immunization with an additional 16 VRC01
gH mice, divided into two groups. All mice in the repeat experi-
ment were primed with eOD-GT8 60-mer and boosted with
BG505 core-GT3 NP according to the schedule in Figure 4B.
One group of eight mice received BG505 SOSIP N276D for the
final two boosts, while the other group received a cocktail of
SOSIP N276D isolates, one each from clades A, B, and C
(ABC SOSIP N276D; Figure S3; Table S2). We did not observe
any difference between the two groups of mice with respect to
serum neutralization, with six mice in each group developing
cross-clade neutralization on a 7-virus panel of near-native iso-
lates (identical to the 8-virus panel used in the first round of im-
munizations, but without JRCSF) (Figure 4B). Only three mice
in each group developed neutralizing activity against BG505
N276A, suggesting that using a single isolate for the final two
boosts did not focus the immune response on the immunizing
isolate. This is also in agreement with the first immunizations,
as three of the six BG505 N276A-boosted mice that displayed
neutralizing
activity
developed
heterologous
neutralization
without acquiring detectable autologous neutralizing activity.

We expressed 25 mAbs from eight VRC01 gH mice that were

them for neutralizing activity on the 7-virus N276A virus panel

 described earlier. Generally, neutralization breadth of mAbs from
each mouse correlated with the breadth of serum neutralization,
although one mouse (285) that showed no detectable serum
neutralization produced a single mAb with moderate neutraliza-
tion activity. Antibodies from several mice showed broad
neutralization on the 7-virus near-native panel, and mAbs from
mouse 286 neutralized select isolates with potency comparable
to mature VRC01 (Figure S6). The mAbs were then screened on a
larger 25-virus panel of N276A isolates (Figure 5A). The broadest

antibodies all came from a single mouse
that also had the broadest serum neutral-
ization (286, first boosted by SOSIP-
GT3). Three mAbs from this mouse
(Nem227, Nem10, and Nem11) were sur-
prisingly broad and potent, neutralizing
up to 48% of the viruses on the 25-virus
panel with a median IC50 of <1 mg/ml.
Because Nem10 and Nem11 neutral-
ized 191084 B7-19 N276A with potencies
comparable to mature VRC01, we tested
the ability of these two mAbs to neutralize
the fully native version of 191084 B7-19, a
tier 2 virus (Sellhorn et al., 2012; Hraber
et al., 2014). Both antibodies were able
to neutralize wild-type virus grown in
293S cells, albeit with lower potency (Fig-
ure 5B), suggesting that the mAbs can
accommodate
the
N276
glycan
and
other CD4bs glycans when they are of
reduced size. Critically, both antibodies
also showed weak neutralizing activity
against fully native virus grown in 293T
cells (Figure 5B), which in comparison to the high potency
against 293T-grown N276A virus suggests that the antibodies
are capable of accommodating the N276 glycan to a degree
but at some energy cost to binding that precludes high-affinity
interaction. No neutralizing activity was detected for these
mAbs against the other native viruses in the 25-member panel
grown in 293T cells. It is important to note that enhanced po-
tency against virus isolates lacking the N276 glycan site is
consistent with a VRC01-like response. Mature VRC01 is
1466
Cell 166, 1459–1470, September 8, 2016
 substantially more potent against isolates lacking the N276
glycan, but removal of the N276 glycan site does not make tier
2 viruses more susceptible to the non-VRC01-class bnAb b12,
to CD4 IgG2, or to the CD4-binding site-directed non-neutral-
izing antibodies b6 or F105 (Jardine et al., 2016b). In summary,
an immunization program consisting of an eOD-GT8 60-mer
prime followed by boosts with BG505 GT3 (NP or SOSIP) and
SOSIP N276D elicited antibodies with broad neutralization on a
panel of near-native, tier-2 virus isolates, moderate neutraliza-
tion of one wild-type virus grown in 293S cells and weak neutral-
ization of one fully native tier-2 virus.
DISCUSSION
VRC01-class bnAbs are prototypical examples of the neutralizing
anti-HIV response that an optimal vaccine would elicit: they are
broadly and potently neutralizing; multiple VRC01-class bnAbs
have been shown to be protective against infection in animal
models; and VRC01-class naive B cell precursors are likely to be
present at a reasonable frequency in a large fraction of the popu-
lation thus offering targets to initiate vaccine elicitation. However,
induction of such responses remains a massive challenge in part
because VRC01-class bnAbs display exceptionally high levels of
somatic mutation and GLrev versions of these antibodies have
no detectable affinity for all native-like HIV Env molecules tested
thus far. A multi-step reductionist vaccine strategy has the poten-
tial to address both of these issues: an engineered germline-tar-
geting prime can activate VRC01-class precursors and generate
boostable VRC01-class memory B cells, and successive heterol-
ogous boosts with increasingly native-like immunogens can pro-
duce additive rounds of somatic mutation and gradually refine
the ability of maturing antibodies to recognize native HIV
Env. Development of minimally mutated variants of VRC01-class
antibodies that retain broad and potent neutralizing activity has
further raised expectation that a VRC01-like antibody response
is achievable by vaccination (Georgiev et al., 2014; Jardine et al.,
2016b).
We have previously reported a germline-targeting immu-
nogen, eOD-GT8 60-mer, capable of activating germline pre-
cursors of VRC01-class bnAbs. Because eOD-GT8 60-mer
requires
a
highly
engineered
CD4bs
epitope
to
activate
VRC01-class precursors, antibodies elicited by priming with
eOD-GT8 60-mer do not show any detectable affinity for native
HIV Env (Jardine et al., 2015). Therefore, the lack of intermedi-
ate immunogens to bridge the gap between the engineered
CD4bs in eOD-GT8 60-mer and the native CD4bs in native-
like trimers like BG505 SOSIP has remained an obstacle to
the elicitation of neutralizing VRC01-class antibody responses.
Here, we report the development of core-GT3 and SOSIP-GT3,
vaccine components designed to shepherd primed VRC01-
class precursors toward intermediate VRC01-class function.
Boosting VRC01-gH mice with BG505-GT3 (NP or SOSIP)
and then with BG505 SOSIP N276D resulted in the elicitation
of highly mutated antibodies with a significant fraction of the
mutations shared with mature VRC01-class bnAbs. Enrichment
of VRC01-class mutations in heavy chains following immuniza-
tion, and convergence of light-chain CDR3 residues toward
the sequence of mature VRC01, indicate that boosting with
BG505-GT3 and SOSIP N276D establishes strong selective
pressure on specific VRC01-class mutations and places these
antibodies on a maturation trajectory consistent with partially
mature VRC01-class antibodies.
Although boostedVRC01 gH mice showed broad neutralization
onapanelofN276Aviruses,neutralizationoffullynativeviruscon-
taining the N276 glycan site was limited to a single heterologous
tier 2 isolate and was substantially less potent. While the weak
neutralization of fully native HIV indicates that there is still signifi-
cant work to be done before we are able to elicit a truly functional
broadly neutralizing response, these data strongly suggest
that the elicited responses are VRC01-class antibodies of inter-
mediate maturity. Mature VRC01, in contrast to non-neutralizing
mAbs that target the CD4bs, neutralizes N276A viruses much
more potently than fully native viruses, so the limited activity of
the elicited mAbs against fully native viruses containing the

cells (red), with potency highest against N276A virus. In the bottom three

 N276 glycan site may simply be a normal feature of partially
mature VRC01-class antibodies (Jardine et al., 2016b; Kong
et al., 2016). Indeed, the observed preference for N276A is
not unexpected, as neither the prime nor any of the boosting im-
munogens contain the N276 glycan site. In mature VRC01-class
bnAbs, the N276 glycan is accommodated by use of a short
LCDR1 loop, either germline-encoded or generated through
SHM-mediated LCDR1 deletions (Jardine et al., 2016b; West
et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2013). Encouragingly, we observed a sig-
nificant fraction of elicited mAbs with LCDR1 lengths matching
those of germline-encoded short LCDR1s in mature VRC01-class
bnAbs.
The relatively low VRC01-class precursor frequency and
substantial competition from other clones in the VRC01 gH
mouse pose a relatively high bar for elicitation of VRC01-class
responses. Thus, the ability to recall VRC01-class precursors
and drive maturation toward mature VRC01-class function vali-
dates the reductionist sequential immunization strategy and
represents a significant milestone in HIV vaccine development.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice
All animal studies were approved by The Scripps Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. VRC01 gH trans-
genic mice have been described previously (Jardine et al., 2015). Mice were 6-8 weeks old at the time of the first immunization. 63%
of the mice were male and 37% were female, with each immunization group containing a mix of male and female mice. Mice were
housed in a specific pathogen free environment.
Healthy, HIV-Negative Human PBMCs
Leukopaks from two heathy, HIV-negative individuals (a 28 year-old female and a 33 year-old male) were obtained from a commercial
vendor (AllCells) using a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both AllCells and The Scripps Research Institute.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using gradient centrifugation.
METHOD DETAILS
Protein Production and Purification
eOD-GT8 and BG505 GT3 monomers and NPs were produced and purified as described previously (Jardine et al., 2015). BG505
SOSIP D664 and BG505-GT3 SOSIP gp140 trimers were produced in mammalian cells (HEK293F) by co-transfection of the trimer
gene and furin protease, at a trimer to furin ratio of 2:1. The pre-transfected cells were maintained in 293 Freestyle media (Life Tech-
nologies) in a humidified 37�C C02 incubator (8%), rotating at 135rpm at a density of �2.4 3 106 cells/ml. The genes were transfected
using 293fectin (Invitrogen) and harvested 4-5 days later. The cells were centrifuged at 4000rpm for 15min, filtered using 0.2 mm filter
(Millipore) and a protease inhibitor was added at ratio of 1ml per liter of supernatant (Protease Arrest, GBiosciences). The superna-
tants were purified by nickel affinity purification using His-Trap columns (GE), starting with a wash buffer (20mM Imidizole, 500 mM
NaCl, 20 mM Na2HPO4) and mixing with elution buffer (500 mM Imidizole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Na2HPO4) using a linear gradient.
The trimers were then purified by semi-analytical size exclusion chromatography on a S200Increase 10-300 column (GE) in HBS
(10mM HEPES, 150mM NaCl). The trimer fractions were pooled, concentrated to 1mg/ml by using Ultracel 30K centrifugal spin con-
centrators (Millipore) and measuring concentration on a NanoDrop 2000c Spectrophotometer using the absorption signal at 280 nm,
frozen in thin-walled PCR tubes using liquid nitrogen, and then stored at �80�C. BG505 SOSIP trimers produced by this in-house
process have been thawed and analyzed by SECMALS, SPR, differential scanning calorimetry, and electron microscopy and
have been found to possess the native-like antigenic profile, thermal stability and closed trimeric structure that have been reported
by others for BG505 SOSIP purified by an antibody-affinity column followed by SEC (Julien et al., 2013; Lyumkis et al., 2013; Pancera
et al., 2014; Sanders et al., 2013).
The thermostable self-assembling lumazine sythase 60-mer (PDB ID: 1HQK), previously described for displaying eOD-GT6 (Jar-
dine et al., 2013) and eOD-GT8 (Jardine et al., 2015), was adapted to display stabilized extended HIV gp120 core (gp120core-e)
antigens from different strains. Initial expression tests with gp120core-e fused to the 1hqk sequence (gp120core-e-1hqk) via various
length linkers failed to produce fully assembled particles despite high expression levels of the subunits. We then tested co-transfec-
tion with a plasmid encoding only the base subunit of lumazine synthase to insert spacers into the 60-mer thereby reducing the
crowding on the surface. Of all gp120core-e-1hqk/base 1hqk plasmid DNA combinations tested (95/5, 90/10, 85/15, 80/20, 66/
33, 50/50, 33/60), an 80% gp120core-e-1hqk and 20% base 1hqk mixture produced the highest proportion of assembled 60mers.
Antibody Production
Antibodies were expressed in the pFUSEss human IgG1 vector (Invitrogen). Heavy- and light-chain plasmids were cotransfected (1:1
ratio) in 293 FreeStyle cells using 293fectin (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and
antibody supernatants were harvested 4-5 days after transfection. Antibody supernatants were purified over Protein A Sepharose 4
Fast Flow (GE healthcare) columns, eluted with 0.1M citric acid (pH 3.0), and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline.
Surface Plasmon Resonance
Kinetics and affinities of antibody-antigen interactions were measured as described previously (Jardine et al., 2016a). Briefly, we
measured kinetics and affinities of antibody-antigen interactions on a ProteOn XPR36 (Bio-Rad) using GLC Sensor Chip (Bio-Rad)
and 1x HBS-EP+ pH 7.4 running buffer (20x stock from Teknova, Cat. No H8022) supplemented with BSA at 1mg/ml. We followed
the Human Antibody Capture Kit instructions (Cat. No BR-1008-39 from GE) to prepare chip surfaces for ligand capture. In a typical
experiment, about 6000 RU of capture antibody was amine-coupled in all 6 flow cells of the GLC Chip. Regeneration was accom-
plished using 3M Magnesium Chloride with 180 s contact time and injected four times per each cycle. Raw sensograms
were analyzed using ProteOn Manager software (Bio-Rad), including interspot and column double referencing, and either Equilibrium
fits or Kinetic fits with Langmuir model, or both, were employed when applicable. Analyte concentrations were measured on a
NanoDrop 2000c Spectrophotometer using Absorption signal at 280 nm.

 Single-Cell Sorting by Flow Cytometry
Mice spleen and lymph node samples were processed for single B cell sorting based on previously described methods (Sok et al.,
2014; Tiller et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2011), with slight modifications. Mouse spleens were stained with primary fluorophore-conjugated
antibodies to murine CD4, CD8, F4/80, CD11c, Gr-1, CD19, B220, IgD, IgM, CD38, and GL7 markers. Memory B cells were selected
for the phenotype CD19+, B220+, CD4-, CD8-, F4/80-, CD11c-, Gr-1-, IgM-, IgD-, while CD38 and GL7 markers were monitored to
measure germinal center B cell frequencies (CD38-, GL7+). For antigen-specific staining, 50 nM of biotinylated AviTag r1-core-
N276D monomer and its CD4bs KO variant (r1-core-KO) were coupled to Streptavidin-AF488 and Streptavidin-PE (Life Technolo-
gies) in equimolar ratios, respectively. B cells of interest were single-cell sorted into 96 well plates containing lysis buffer on a BD
FACSAria Fusion sorter and immediately stored at �80�C (Sok et al., 2014; Tiller et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2011).
Single B Cell RT-PCR, Gene Amplification, and Cloning
Reverse transcription and subsequent PCR amplification of heavy and light chain variable genes were performed using SuperScript
III (Life Technologies) according to published protocols (Sok et al., 2014; Tiller et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2011). All PCR reactions were
performed in 25 ml volume with 2.5 ml of cDNA transcript using HotStar Taq DNA polymerase master mix (QIAGEN) and mixtures of
previously described primers (Tiller et al., 2008) that were supplemented with a human VH1-2 primer (Jardine et al., 2015). Second
round nested-PCR reactions were performed using Phusion proof reading polymerase (NEB). Two additional rounds of PCR were
performed using primers with barcodes specific to the plate number and well location as well as adapters appropriate for sequencing
on an Illumina MiSeq. This reaction was performed in a 25 ml volume with HotStar Taq DNA polymerase master mix (QIAGEN). Ampli-
fied IgG heavy- and light-chain variable regions were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq (600-base v3 reagent kit; Illumina) and reads
corresponding to the same plate/well location were combined into consensus sequences. Germline assignment and sequence anno-
tation of the consensus sequences was performed with AbStar (https://.github.com/briney/abstar).
ELISA Assays
Ninety-six-well ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4�C with 50 uL PBS containing 100 ng of antigen per well. The wells were
washed four times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and blocked with 3% BSA at room temperature for 1 hr. Serial dilutions
of sera were then added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. After washing four times, goat
anti-mouse IgG F(ab’)2 conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Pierce), diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.025% Tween
20, was added to the wells. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr, washed four times, and the plate was developed by
adding 50 uL of alkaline phosphatase substrate (Sigma) to 5 ml alkaline phosphatase staining buffer (pH 9.8), according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. The optical density at 405 nm was read on a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). ELISA protocol for mAbs
was as follows. ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4�C with 25 ml of 4 mg/ml anti-His Ab (Epitope TagAntibody His.H8, MA1-
21315). The wells were washed 5 times with PBST (PBS with 0.2% Tween 20) and blocked with 5% milk at RT for 1 hr. The wells
were washed 5 times with PBST. mAb were diluted to 10 mg/mL in 0.1% milk PBST then added to the plates and incubated at RT
for 1 hr. After washing 5 times in PBST, goat anti-human HRP (Jackson) was diluted 1:5000 in 0.1% milk PBST, then 25 ml was added
to each well and the plate was incubated at RT for 1hr. After washing 5 times in PBST, the plate was developed by adding 50 ml TMB
ELISA solution (Thermofisher) and then 50 ml sulfuric acid stop solution after 10 min. The optical density at 450 nm was read on a
microplate reader (Molecular Devices).
Envelope Mutations
Mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and mu-
tants were verified by Sanger DNA sequencing.
Pseudovirus Production and Neutralization Assays
To produce pseudoviruses, plasmids encoding Env were co-transfected with an Env-deficient genomic backbone plasmid
(pSG3DEnv) in a 1:2 ratio with the transfection reagent Fugene 6 (Promega). Pseudoviruses were harvested 72 hr post transfection
for use in neutralization assays. Neutralizing activity was assessed using a single round of replication pseudovirus assay and TZM-bl
target cells, as described previously (Li et al., 2005; Walker et al., 2011). Briefly, TZM-bl cells were seeded in a 96-well flat bottom
plate at a concentration of 20,000 cells/well. The serially diluted virus/antibody mixture, which was pre-incubated for 1 hr, was
then added to the cells and luminescence was quantified 48 hr following infection via lysis and addition of Bright-GloTM Luciferase
substrate (Promega). To determine IC50 values, serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with virus and the dose-response curves
were fitted using nonlinear regression.
Antibody NGS on HIV-Negative Donors
Leukopaks were obtained from two healthy, HIV-negative individuals (AllCells) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were isolated by gradient centrifugation. PBMCs from each donor were separated into aliquots of 500 m cells and total RNA was
extracted separately from each PBMC aliquot (RNeasy Maxi Kit, QIAGEN). In quadruplicate, 10uL of each RNA aliquot was sepa-
rately amplified in 100uL RT-PCR reactions (OneStep RT-PCR Kit, QIAGEN) using previously reported primers (Briney et al.,
2012b) and with the following cycling conditions: 55�C for 30 min; 94�C for 5 min; 25 cycles of 94�C for 30 s, 55�C for 30 s,

 72�C for 2 min; 72�C for 7 min. RT-PCR reactions were purified using 0.8 volumes of SPRIselect magnetic beads (Beckman-
Coulter Genomics) and replicate RT-PCR reactions were eluted together in 50ul of water. In duplicate reactions for each pooled
RT-PCR sample, Illumina sequencing adapters and sample-specific indexes were added during a second round of PCR using 2uL
of purified RT-PCR product in 100uL of total reaction volume (HotStarTaq Plus; QIAGEN) and using the following thermal cycling
program: 94�C for 5 min; 10 cycles of 94�C for 30 s, 55�C for 30 s, 72C for 2 min; 72�C for 7 min. Indexed PCR products were
purified using 75uL of SPRIselect beads and eluted in 50uL of water. Samples from each donor were quantified using fluorometry
(Qubit; Life Technologies), pooled at approximately equimolar concentrations and each sample pool was requantified. The end
result was two pools of samples, each pool corresponding to a single subject and consisting of 18-20 separately barcoded sam-
ples that represent the amplification product of approximately 500 million PBMCs. Sequencing was then performed on an Illumina
HiSeq (HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2, 500 cycles).
Processing of NGS Sequence Data
Using the AbStar analysis pipeline (https://github.com/briney/abstar), raw sequencing reads were quality trimmed with Sickle
(https://github.com/najoshi/sickle), adapters were removed with cutadapt (Martin, 2011), and paired reads were merged with
PANDAseq (Masella et al., 2012). Germline gene assignment and sequence annotation was performed with AbStar and output
was deposited into a MongoDB database. For each sample, which represents the antibody sequences derived from approximately
500 m PBMCs, a non-redundant database of amino-acid sequences was created, including only heavy-chain sequences encoded
by IGHV1-2. Because each PBMC aliquot was processed separately, redundant copies across samples represents independent
occurrences of the same sequence and these redundancies were retained.
Synthetic Generation of Randomly Mutated VH1-2 Heavy-Chain Sequences
Separately for each subject, each IGHV1-2 heavy chain sequence was aligned to the AbStar-assigned germline allele of IGHV1-2 and
the position and mutated residue of each mutation were noted. These mutations were then used to generate synthetically mutated
antibody sequences based on the conditional probability of actually occurring somatic mutations. For example, if the first synthetic
mutation was an Alanine at position 24 (24A), the probability distribution for the subsequent synthetic mutation was computed using
NGS sequences that contain a naturally occurring 24A mutation. If the second mutation was 36F, then the probability distribution for
the third synthetic mutation would be computed from NGS sequences with both 24A and 36F. Of note, prior mutations were excluded
from the conditional probability distribution. This ensures that, for example, the 24A mutation will not happen a second time in the
same sequence. It is also important to note that, due to technical limitations on sequencing length and the annealing location of
amplification primers midway through the framework 1 region (FR1), mutations in the first portion of FR1 were not sampled and
thus were not used in mutation probability calculations. This is evident in the lack of mutations near the start of synthetically generated
antibody sequences (Figure 3F). Because most VRC01-class mutations occur in CDR1 and CDR2, it is not likely that excluding FR1
mutations had a significant effect on the overall frequency of randomly occurring VRC01-class mutations.
Design of CD4bs Native-like Trimer Cocktail
A five member CD4bs cocktail was engineered on gp120-core by analyzing the sequence diversity of HIV strains at VRC01-class
epitope positions, which includes the V5 loop. Each member of the cocktail incorporates mutations from a single strain, and these
five strains were chosen to best mimic the diversity of HIV at VRC01-class epitope positions. We next created a native-like trimer
cocktail (ABC) by transferring the mutations from the gp120-core cocktail and adding new mutations found proximal to the
PGV04 VRC01-class bnAbs in the Env trimer structure (PDB ID: 3J5M) as well as inclusion of the V2 loop. Three of the five trimers
formed native-like structures and antigenic profiles and were used as boosting immunogens in the VRC01-gH mice.
Negative-Stain Electron Microscopy
BG505-based SOSIP trimers were analyzed by negative stain EM by adapting a previously published protocol (de Taeye et al., 2016).
Differential Scanning Calorimetry
MicroCal VP-Capillary differential scanning calorimeter (Malvern Instruments) was used for DSC measurements. The protein samples
were diluted into HEPES buffer to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. The experiment scanned from 20�C to 90�C at a scan rate of
90�C/h. Data were analyzed by buffer correction, normalization, and baseline subtraction (Origin 7.0).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
When computing the frequency of random incorporation of VRC01-class mutations, we iterated temporally through mutations (taking
the first mutation from each sequence, then the first two mutations, etc) and determined the frequency of mutations from each syn-
thetic antibody sequence that were VRC01-class. Using the range of VRC01-class frequencies at each step, we computed the mean
frequency (shown as a black line Figure 3D) and the 95% confidence intervals (shown as gray shading surrounding the mean line
in Figure 3D). Both the mean and 95% CI were computed in Python using the Numpy and Scipy packages. All other statistical

 calculations were performed in Graphpad Prism. The number of replicates, the type of data represented in figure plots, and a descrip-
tion of the statistical method are provided in the applicable figure legends.
