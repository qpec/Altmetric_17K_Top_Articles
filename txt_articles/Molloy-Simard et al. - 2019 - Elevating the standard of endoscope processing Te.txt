Background: The health care community is increasingly aware of the processing challenges and infection
risks associated with duodenoscopes owing to published reports of outbreaks and regulatory recalls. Studies
have demonstrated that the current practices are inadequate for consistently producing patient-ready endo-
scopes. Alternatively, terminal sterilization would offer a greater margin of safety and potentially reduce the
risk of patient infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hydrogen peroxide−ozone
sterilizer with regulatory clearance for terminal sterilization of duodenoscopes.
Methods and Results: Validation studies were performed under laboratory simulated-use and clinical in-use
conditions. The overkill method study demonstrated a reduction of at least 6-log of Geobacillus stearothermo-
philus spores at half-cycle, providing a sterility assurance level of 10¡6. In addition, the sterilizer achieved a
6-log reduction of G stearothermophilus in the presence of inorganic and organic soils in a simulated-use
study. The clinical in-use study confirmed that the sterilizer achieved sterilization of patient-soiled duodeno-
scopes under actual use conditions.
Conclusions: Simulated-use and clinical in-use studies demonstrated the efficacy of a hydrogen peroxide
−ozone sterilizer for terminal sterilization of duodenoscopes. This offers health care facilities a viable alterna-
tive for duodenoscope processing to enhance patient safety as part of a comprehensive infection control
strategy.

BACKGROUND
While endoscopes play a vital role in the effective delivery of
health care and offer patients many benefits, the risks associated
with iatrogenic transmission via endoscopes continue to be a sig-
nificant health care concern. “Failure to consistently and effectively
reprocess flexible endoscopes” is listed second on the Top 10
Health Technology Hazards for 2018 published by the Emergency
Care Research Institute.1 Endoscope processing has consistently
been listed as a significant hazard for the last decade because endo-
scopes are associated with more cases of device-mediated patient
infections than any other medical instrument.2 Their design
complexity presents a substantial challenge to achieve consistent
and effective processing. Duodenoscopes present a particular chal-
lenge because they contain multiple long and narrow lumens and
are side-viewing endoscopes consisting of a recessed elevator used
to direct endoscopic accessories.3-7 This processing challenge is
evidenced by documented cases of duodenoscope contamination8
and by related patient infections,9-15 even after adherence to the
manufacturer’s processing instructions,16-19 which include high-
level disinfection (HLD). Several outbreaks of patient infections
with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were linked
to contaminated duodenoscopes in the United States and around
the world.17,19,20 CRE are highly transmissible, difficult to treat

Funding/support: This study was funded by TSO3. Use and cleaning of the duodenoscopes for the clinical study was performed by hospital personnel in accordance with their
established practices, without direction by the study sponsor. Sampling of the duodenoscopes was conducted by qualified personnel of the company. This work was executed and
monitored in accordance with an ISO 13485:2016 quality system. All of the work presented here was subject to review by the US Food and Drug Administration and led to regula-
tory clearance of the sterilizer studied for terminal sterilization of duodenoscopes.

 owing to their resistance to antimicrobial treatments, and result in
a high mortality rate.21,22 Investigations from institutions in which
outbreaks occurred demonstrated that a single contaminated
endoscope can infect several patients with CRE over long periods
of time, despite adherence to recommended processing practi-
ces.19 Furthermore, a study from 2015 estimated that one-third of
institutions do not use surveillance methods to identify possible
duodenoscope-related bacterial transmissions,23 which reduces
the number of declared infections.
Improving safety for endoscopy patients requires a multifactorial
approach, including an effective personnel training program, compre-
hensive quality control systems, validated methods for ensuring ade-
quate processing, and designing processes with margins of safety
that address the level of risk associated with the use of these devices.
The
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
and
Centers
for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended a list of
supplemental duodenoscope processing measures to further reduce
the risk of infection and increase the safety of these medical devi-
ces.24 These supplemental methods included microbiological cultur-
ing, repeat HLD, HLD followed by liquid chemical sterilization,
and HLD followed by ethylene oxide (EO) sterilization. However,
microbiological culturing has received mixed reviews, since it
requires complex staff training, is expensive, and requires aseptic
facilities.25-29 Repeated HLD has not been shown to consistently pro-
vide a patient-ready endoscope.13,30-34 The use of HLD combined
with EO sterilization, which is time-consuming,6 also does not guar-
antee that the duodenoscope is microorganism free.31,35 A study by
Snyder et al showed no significant difference between duodeno-
scopes processed by HDL, double HLD, or HLD combined with EO ster-
ilization, with positive bacterial growth being detected following all
three processing methods.31
Terminal sterilization of duodenoscopes has been identified as a
leading solution for improving duodenoscope processing outcomes
since it offers a significantly greater margin of safety than HLD.36-38
According to the Spaulding classification scheme, flexible gastrointes-
tinal endoscopes are classified as semi-critical devices, in which case
sterilization is recommended, or if this is not possible, processing
using HLD at a minimum.39-41 Duodenoscopes are designed as semi-
critical but are used as critical devices in a significant number of pro-
cedures.6,42 To accommodate this reality, some members of the
health care community have proposed to reclassify duodenoscopes
as critical36 by modifying the Spaulding definition of critical items.38-
40,43 Nevertheless, there are challenges associated with transitioning
from the current practice to terminal sterilization.
The primary modality currently employed for terminal steriliza-
tion of duodenoscopes is EO. In some cases, it has been part of the
strategy used to successfully control CRE outbreaks, 18 although pre-
vious research has demonstrated that EO sterilization is not always
effective in the presence of organic and inorganic soils when tested in
surrogate devices.44,45 While EO has been validated by duodenoscope
manufacturers, it has not been cleared by the FDA for sterilization of
multichannel gastrointestinal endoscopes.45,46 The toxicity of EO
adds to the requirements for occupational health and safety and
necessitates an aeration time of 12 hours or longer to ensure the
absence of toxic residues on the endoscope.6,46 EO sterilization sys-
tems may not be accessible to all health care facilities and are
costly,24,36 since they require control of the room temperature and
humidity, EO concentration monitoring equipment, and specific facil-
ity design requirements, including a nonrecirculating or dedicated
ventilation system.47 When EO sterilization cannot be performed
locally, additional logistics and costs associated with transport and
longer turnaround times are required.6 EO sterilization turnaround
times are typically 17 to 48 hours, which require a costly increase in
duodenoscope inventory.6,31,34 For these reasons, EO sterilization is
not considered a long-term solution,36,46 highlighting the need for
new low-temperature sterilization technologies specifically validated
for duodenoscopes.27,36,37,46
Recently, multiple hospitals in the United States and Canada
implemented
hydrogen
peroxide−ozone
terminal
sterilization
instead of HLD as an alternate solution to prevent or eradicate patient
infections linked to inadequately processed duodenoscopes.48,49
Since terminal sterilization has been identified as a key solution for
improving the safety of reusable flexible endoscopes and members of
the health care community expressed the need for terminal steriliza-
tion of duodenoscopes, the current study was performed to evaluate
the microbicidal efficacy of a hydrogen peroxide−ozone terminal
sterilization technology for duodenoscopes with an overkill method,
a simulated-use method, and a clinical in-use validation. The tests
reported here were performed both under simulated worst-case lab-
oratory conditions and in-use clinical conditions.
METHODS
Sterilizer and duodenoscope description
The STERIZONE VP4 Sterilizer (TSO3 Inc., Quebec City, Canada)
was used in this study to evaluate sterilization of duodenoscopes.
This sterilizer is intended for use in terminal sterilization of cleaned,
rinsed, and dried metal and nonmetal reusable medical devices in
health care facilities. The sterilizer uses dual sterilants (vaporized
hydrogen peroxide and ozone) in a multiphase process. A detailed
description of the sterilizer has been previously published.50 This
hydrogen peroxide−ozone sterilizer was approved by the FDA
(K172191), Health Canada (Health Canada License No. 37796, October
23, 2015) and the European Union (CE Mark granted on February 16,
2015) to include sterilization of multichannel flexible duodenoscopes,
colonoscopes, and gastroscopes with lumen dimensions listed in the
sterilizer’s indications for use.
The duodenoscope model used for this study was the Olympus
EVIS EXERA II Duodenovideoscope TJF-Q180V (AIZU OLYMPUS CO.,
LTD, Aizuwakamatsu-Shi Fukushima, Japan), the most widely used
duodenoscope in the United States.51 This duodenoscope is composed
of 3 channels (instrument/suction, air, and water), which will be sep-
arated into 7 channel segments for the purpose of this study. The
term “channel segment” is defined here as a lumen with 2 openings.
Its center (halfway point) is the most difficult location to reach for the
sterilant, thus the most challenging location to sterilize.
This duodenoscope model has an elevator mechanism, and the
wire actuating the elevator mechanism is in a sealed channel. A recall
was conducted on this endoscope model (FDA#Z-2807-201552),
which led to a newly designed special brush (MAJ-1888) for the
mechanism to facilitate cleaning of the device. Another recall was
conducted to change the elevator mechanism to comply with the
design proposed in the duodenoscope 510(k) (FDA#Z-0757-201653).
All devices tested in this study were duodenoscopes with the rede-
signed sealed elevator mechanism.
Figure 1 represents a schematic of the tested duodenoscope
model. Number identifications for channel segments and other sites
were added to the figure to support what is described in the following
sections.
Overkill (half-cycle) test method
The tested duodenoscope model was first evaluated in the hydro-
gen peroxide−ozone sterilizer with an overkill method performed in
triplicate using 2 separate duodenoscopes. The overkill method (or
half-cycle method) consists of inoculating the medical devices with
more than 1.0 £ 106 colony-forming units (CFU) of the most resistant
organism identified for this sterilization process and by showing no
growth after the half-cycle point of the sterilization cycle (cycle
244
V. Molloy-Simard et al. / American Journal of Infection Control 47 (2019) 243−250
 performed included 1 phase of sterilant exposure instead of 2 phases
in a complete cycle). This results in a sterility assurance level of
10¡6,54 meaning that there is a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of an organism
surviving the sterilization process. Although sterilizing with a half-
cycle would never be performed in clinical use, this overkill approach
recommended by the FDA results in a significant margin of safety,
which is not required when validating endoscope processing using
HLD.
Spore suspension solutions of 1.0 £ 106 to 2.5 £ 106 CFU/10 mL
of Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953 were prepared from
stock solutions (Iuvo BioScience, Rush, NY, USA). G stearothermo-
philus
is
a
spore-forming
aerobic
thermophilic
bacteria
that
requires 55°C for growth conditions (ATCC 7953). This microorgan-
ism was selected because it is the most resistant to hydrogen per-
oxide and ozone (sterilants of the tested sterilizer), thus the one
recommended for sterility testing of hydrogen peroxide and ozone
sterilizers. 55
The inoculation sites tested as part of this overkill validation
included the endoscope channels and elevator mechanism (Fig 1:
sites 1 to 7, A). The elevator mechanism was inoculated using 10 mL
of the prepared spore solution. The spore solution was deposited
using a micropipette tip in the hinge and in the recessed space associ-
ated with the hinge identified in Figure 1, site A. Then, the mechanism
was manipulated (up-down) at least 3 times to allow spreading of the
inoculum and penetration in the hinge.
The channels were also inoculated with 10 mL of inoculum
(1.0 £ 106 to 2.5 £ 106 CFU/10 mL) but with added water to dilute
the inoculum. For the inoculum to reach the center of each channel
segment (the most challenging location to sterilize), sterile water
was added so the inoculum could reach the center of the channel
by gravity. The needed volume of added sterile water differed
depending on the length and diameter of each channel but ranged
from 90 mL-390 mL. The controls performed to validate that the
inoculum reached the center of the channels and the specifications
on the inoculation method are explained in detail in a previous
publication.56
After the inoculated duodenoscope was dried overnight, it was
packaged in a compatible sterilization container (Steritite Full size
sealed containers SC06FG, Case Medical Inc., South Hackensack, NJ)
and placed individually in a load. Only 1 gastrointestinal endoscope
can be sterilized in the sterilizer according to the sterilizer’s instruc-
tions for use. No washing step was performed prior to sterilization.
The recommended load temperature for processing in the tested ster-
ilizer is 20°C-26°C. The loads were conditioned at 26°C § 1°C before
processing. To do so, they were stored in a controlled 26°C tempera-
ture room for a minimum of 2 hours with calibrated RTD thermome-
ters
(Omega
Engineering
Inc,
Norwalk,
CT)
placed
on
the
duodenoscope, loading cart, and container to monitor that the
required temperature had been reached. The preconditioning tem-
perature of 26°C was chosen owing to the fact that this load condition
results in the shortest sterilant exposure time and in the lowest mass
of sterilant for the tested sterilizer, therefore representing the most
challenging condition for achieving sterility.50 The loads were then
exposed to a half-cycle of the sterilization process.
After sterilization, the containers were opened in a laminar flow
hood under aseptic conditions. The elevator mechanism was sampled
using a flush-brush-flush method with phosphate sampling buffer
(Salts: Fisher Chemical, Fair Lawn, NJ / Tween 80: Fisher Chemical,
Fair Lawn, NJ). The channels were sampled by flushing a determined
amount of phosphate sampling buffer with the Olympus cleaning
connectors (MB-358, MH-946). When a syringe is plugged into the
MH-946 connector, the sampling buffer flushes more than 1 channel
segment at a time. Specifically, the suction and instrument channels
are flushed together (Fig 1, 1,2,3), and the air and water channels are
flushed together (Fig 1, 4,5,6,7). The selected sampling buffer volume
per group of channels was approximately 10 times the combined
internal volume of the channel segments being sampled.
All sampling buffers were filtered using a sterile 0.45 mm mem-
brane (MicroFunnel, Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). Filters were
incubated on agar media (Standard method agar, Benton, Dickinson
and Co, Sparks, MD) at 55°C-60°C for 7 days to allow the growth of
G stearothermophilus bacteria.

 Simulated-use test method
The sterilization of the duodenoscope model was also evaluated in
the
hydrogen
peroxide−ozone
sterilizer
with
a
simulated-use
method performed in triplicate. Three separate duodenoscopes were
used in this testing. When performing a simulated-use validation, the
most resistant microorganism to the sterilization process is mixed
with organic and inorganic soils and inoculated on devices. These
simulated soils, including organic and inorganic compounds, mimic
clinical use. The inoculated medical devices are not washed (thus
simulating a worst-case scenario) and exposed to a complete cycle of
the sterilization process.57 The intended use of the tested sterilizer
stipulates that medical devices must be cleaned as per the manufac-
turer’s instructions for use before sterilization. Nevertheless, the
cleaning step is omitted in a simulated-use method to perform the
test under worst-case conditions.
Spores suspension solutions of 1.0 £ 106 to 2.5 £ 106 CFU/10 mL of G
stearothermophilus ATCC 7953 mixed with fetal bovine serum (for final
concentration of 5%) and hard water (final concentration of 400 ppm)
were prepared (Microorganism: Iuvo BioScience, Rush, NY/Fetal bovine
serum: BenchMark Gemini Bio-product, West Sacramento, CA/Hard
water salts [AOAC 960.09E]: Fisher Chemical, Fair Lawn, NJ, and Avan-
tor Performance Materials Inc [J.T. Baker], Central Valley, PA).
The duodenoscopes were then inoculated, conditioned, sterilized
with a full cycle and samples were incubated, as described previously
in the overkill validation method. In addition, 3 sites targeting materi-
als susceptible to potential degradation from processing5 were tested
as part of the simulated-use validation. These additional sites
included the bending section adhesive, the insertion tube surface,
and the adhesives around the light source and camera objective
lenses (see Fig 1, sites B, C, and D). These sites were tested on endo-
scopes that were cycled (manually cleaned and sterilized) at least
15 times each in the hydrogen peroxide−ozone sterilizer prior to
testing. The additional sites were inoculated, processed in the steril-
izer, and then sampled by swabbing (Puritan HydraFlock swab,
Guilford, ME).
Clinical in-use test method
A clinical in-use study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of
processing clinically soiled duodenoscopes following the standard
processing steps performed in a health care facility but with the termi-
nal step being sterilization in the hydrogen peroxide−ozone sterilizer
instead of HLD. Hospital-owned duodenoscopes were used during clin-
ical procedures and assessed for their sterility after processing in the
hydrogen peroxide−ozone sterilizer. Five separate duodenoscopes
were used in the clinical study. The tested duodenoscopes were not in
new condition. Signs of wear, including ridges on the insertion tube
and cracks in the bending section, were visually observed. All tested
duodenoscopes were taken from surgeries during which patients were
not on an antimicrobial regimen at the time of the endoscopic retro-
grade cholangiopancreatography procedure, since antimicrobials could
reduce the bioburden level on the endoscope post procedure and bias
the results. Endoscopes from 11 surgical procedures were tested:
endoscopes 1-3 to establish precleaning contamination levels, endo-
scopes 4-8 to establish post−manual cleaning contamination levels,
and endoscopes 9-11 for poststerilization assessment. Precleaning and
postcleaning controls were taken to evaluate the contamination levels
of the duodenoscopes, by sampling each channel group (channel seg-
ments 1-2-3 and 4-5-6-7 sampled together as explained in the overkill
section), the elevator mechanism, and the insertion tube surface of the
endoscope. Precleaning controls were sampled after the clinical proce-
dure, but prior to the operating room bedside cleaning. They were per-
formed in triplicate. Manual cleaning of the tested devices was
performed by the hospital sterile processing department personnel
according to their internal processing procedure, which complies with
the endoscope manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning, but no auto-
mated endoscope reprocessor or HLD step was performed prior to ter-
minal sterilization. Postcleaning controls were sampled after the
manual cleaning performed by the hospital personnel. They were per-
formed in quintuplicate.
The test endoscopes were packaged in compatible containers
(Steritite Full-size sealed containers SC06FG, Case Medical Inc, South
Hackensack, NJ) and processed according to the sterilizer’s instruc-
tions for use. Following sterilization, the duodenoscopes were trans-
ported and sampled under aseptic conditions with the same sampling
methods as described in the previous sections. The duodenoscopes
were tested for contamination in the channels, elevator mechanism,
and insertion tube surface (Fig 1, sites 1-7, A, C). All sampling buffers
were filtered using a sterile 0.45 mm membrane (MicroFunnel, Pall
Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) and membranes were plated. Each sam-
ple was tested and incubated using appropriate media to culture for a
large spectrum of microorganisms: aerobic bacteria (blood agar, 37°C,
7 days), anaerobic bacteria (blood agar, 37°C, 7 days), yeasts and
molds (Sabouraud Dextrose agar, 20°C-25°C, 7 days) (all agar plates
from Hardy Diagnostic, Santa Maria, CA). Anaerobic agar plates were
placed in anaerobic jars with corresponding reagents and anaerobic
indicators (BBL GasPak system jar, BD GasPak EZ, and BBL indicator
strip: Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) for the duration
of the incubation. All plates were incubated for 7 days since it was
demonstrated that microbial cultures from gastrointestinal endo-
scopes can require more than 2 days to efficiently recover microor-
ganisms and demonstrate contamination.58
The surgical procedure, the manual cleaning of the endoscopes,
and the precleaning and postcleaning recovery control sampling
were
performed
at
Centre
Hospitalier
de
l’Universit�
e
Laval
(Qu�
ebec City, Canada). Packaging and sterilization of the tested duo-
denovideoscopes were performed at Hotel-Dieu de Qu�
ebec Hospital
(Qu�
ebec City, Canada). Both hospital centers are affiliates of the Cen-
tre Hospitalier Universitaire hospital group and routinely exchange
sterilization services. The device sampling post-sterilization was per-
formed at TSO3 Inc facilities (Qu�
ebec City, Canada).
Sampling methods validation
The sampling methods for all test sites were validated by direct
inoculation of the sites with 10 CFU-100 CFU of the G stearothermo-
philus spore solution to demonstrate low-level recovery. The tested
sites were inoculated, left to dry overnight, and sampled as explained
in previous sections. All sites were tested in triplicate. The recovery
results obtained ranged from 63%-82%, thus showing that all sam-
pling methods are acceptable based on ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11737-
1:2018.59
RESULTS
Overkill and simulated-use validation
No growth was observed for the sampling of the elevator mecha-
nism and channels following exposure to a half-cycle of the sterilizer
using an overkill method validation. No growth was also observed for
the sampling of the elevator mechanism, channels, and possible deg-
radation sites following exposure to a complete cycle of the sterilizer
using a simulated-use method validation. The results are summarized
in Table 1.
Clinical in-use validation
Endoscopes from 11 surgical procedures were tested as part of the
clinical in-use validation. Table 2 presents the contamination levels

 from surgical procedures 1-3 (precleaning contamination levels) and
4-8 (post–manual cleaning contamination levels).
Table 3 presents the results from surgical procedures 9-11 in
which the duodenoscopes were sampled post sterilization. All tested
sites showed no growth for aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, and
yeasts and molds.
Discussion
Terminal sterilization has been proposed as one potential solution
for improving the safety of reusable flexible endoscopes, specifically
duodenoscopes. For decades, the standard practice has been HLD of
duodenoscopes, resulting in limited development of new technolo-
gies targeted for terminal sterilization of these complex devices. As
duodenoscopes are heat labile, only 2 low-temperature modalities
are currently available for terminal sterilization, including EO and
hydrogen peroxide−ozone sterilization.
While EO sterilization of medical devices has been available since
the 1950s, duodenoscopes do not fall within the indications for use of
commercially available EO sterilizers.46 However, duodenoscope
manufacturers list EO sterilization as a validated processing modality
in the device labeling. Despite this, adoption of EO sterilization of
duodenoscopes has been limited owing to environmental and safety
issues, long turnaround times, and lack of accessibility.6,46,47 In

 contrast, hydrogen peroxide−ozone sterilization was introduced in
2014 and recently gained regulatory clearance for terminal steriliza-
tion of duodenoscopes. This sterilization modality has shorter turn-
around times but is not currently listed as a validated processing
method in duodenoscope manufacturers’ instructions for use. In gen-
eral, both sterilization modalities are harsher on materials36,41 and
will reduce duodenoscope use life relative to HLD processes.
This study was performed to evaluate the microbicidal efficacy of
a hydrogen peroxide−ozone terminal sterilization technology for
duodenoscopes with an overkill method, a simulated-use method,
and a clinical in-use validation. All the validation methods used are
those recommended by the FDA in its Guidance on Premarket Notifica-
tion 510(k) Submissions for Sterilizers Intended for Use in Health Care
Facilities.57
The first set of laboratory tests was performed using the overkill
method in which the device was sterilized with only one-half of the
normal sterilization cycle. Although sterilizing with a half-cycle
would never be performed in clinical use, this overkill approach rec-
ommended by the FDA provides a significant margin of safety not
present when processing endoscopes using HLD. In this testing, no
microorganisms were recovered from all duodenoscopes, demon-
strating a reduction of at least 6-log of G stearothermophilus at half-
cycle, providing a sterility assurance level of 10¡6.
The second set of performed laboratory tests used a simulated-use
approach, in which soils were added to the inoculum mimicking clini-
cal organic and inorganic compounds. For all trials, the test devices
were processed multiple times before the sterility tests were per-
formed. The intended use of the tested hydrogen peroxide−ozone
sterilizer stipulates that medical devices must be cleaned as per the
manufacturer’s instructions for use before sterilization. However, for
the purposes of this study, the cleaning step was omitted to perform
the test under worst-case conditions. In all trials, no microorganisms
were recovered from the tested duodenoscopes after sterilization,
including from sites composed of materials known to degrade from
repetitive processing. Although the study designs differ, these results
contrast other low-temperature sterilization methods that were
reported by Alfa et al44,45, in which ethylene oxide failed to achieve
sterility of narrow flexible lumens in the presence of serum and salt.
Both the overkill and the simulated-use methods demonstrated
that the tested hydrogen peroxide−ozone sterilizer achieves steriliza-
tion of contaminated duodenoscopes under worst-case conditions
not typically encountered in clinical application.
The last part of this study was an evaluation of the sterile efficacy of
clinically-soiled duodenoscopes with all the processing steps typically
performed in a health care facility. The tested sterilizer and duodeno-
scopes were hospital owned. The duodenoscopes had 1-6 years of clini-
cal use with a history of being processed with HLD and were functional.
However, damage was visually observed on the bending section adhe-
sives and insertion tubes, which represented actual use conditions.
Contamination was present on all tested duodenoscopes after the
procedure and immediately prior to sterilization. As expected, a
reduction of the bioburden was shown by the precleaning controls
versus the postcleaning controls on the duodenoscope surface and
air/water channels. However, a measurable reduction of the biobur-
den was not observed for the elevator mechanism and instrument/
suction channels of the duodenoscope. This may have resulted from
the sampling design, in which the sampling fluid was flushed through
the instrument/suction channel and contacted the elevator prior to
collection. Consequently, it is possible that the apparent instrument/
suction channel contamination arises from the elevator mechanism
rather than the channel itself. The elevator mechanism of the endo-
scope showed consistent growth on all postcleaning tests, even after
the recommended manual cleaning with an enzymatic detergent
and brushing with the newly designed brush. This supports previous
conclusions
regarding
the
challenge
of
effectively
cleaning
duodenoscopes.3−7 After terminal sterilization, the duodenoscopes
were aseptically sampled and cultured for the detection of a large
spectrum of microorganisms. Despite the known cleaning challenges
and the existing wear of the duodenoscopes, no bacterial growth was
observed on any of the processed duodenoscopes after terminal ster-
ilization in the tested hydrogen peroxide−ozone sterilizer under clin-
ical conditions.
Results from this study demonstrate that the tested hydrogen
peroxide−ozone sterilizer
is
effective
for
terminal
sterilization
of duodenoscopes, which could be implemented as part of a compre-
hensive infection control strategy. Terminal sterilization of duodeno-
scopes offers a higher safety margin than the current practice of HLD,
although it is important to emphasize that it does not eliminate the
requirement for effective cleaning of the device following the manu-
facturer’s instructions for use. Cleaning of the device prior to steriliza-
tion is critical to prevent an accumulation of organic material and the
formation of biofilm, both of which could inhibit sterilization and
present a risk to patients. Biofilms may contribute to the recovery of
viable microorganisms post processing even when current guidelines
are followed.31,60
The bulk of the literature about the processing of duodenoscopes
relates to the currently recommended guidelines of performing HLD.
Recent studies show positive bacterial contamination of duodeno-
scopes after HLD58,60-62 and double-HLD processing.13,30-34 And while
it has been part of a strategy used to successfully control CRE out-
breaks,18 Snyder et al31 sampled 173 duodenoscopes after processing
with HLD followed by EO sterilization and recovered viable organisms
from 22.5% duodenoscopes. It should be noted that the duodeno-
scopes included in the Snyder et al study predated the duodenoscope
elevator design change discussed in the material section. Visrodia
et al reported negative cultures for 51 duodenoscopes subjected to
combined HLD and EO sterilization,34 though the details of this study
are not currently published. Naryzhny et al detected a rate of positive
cultures of 1.2% after EO sterilization, although they were culturing
for CRE bacteria only.35
The current study demonstrated the absence of detectable microor-
ganisms in duodenoscopes following hydrogen peroxide−ozone steril-
ization, using culturing methods covering a large spectrum of
microorganisms. The data presented here are from a limited sample
size, but provide the first set of data to support terminal sterilization
using a hydrogen peroxide−ozone sterilizer. Future work should
include clinical studies in additional health care facilities. This would
not only increase the confidence in the conclusions of this study, but
also evaluate the impact of variable processing practices on the efficacy
of the sterilization process. Additional proposed studies will evaluate of
the sterile efficacy of hydrogen peroxide−ozone sterilization in the
presence of biofilms and the formation of biofilm when low-tempera-
ture terminal sterilization is routinely used compared with HLD.
CONCLUSIONS
This study showed that the hydrogen peroxide−ozone sterilizer
can effectively sterilize duodenoscopes, under laboratory worst-case
conditions and in actual clinical use. The overkill method validated
the sterility assurance level of 10¡6, while the simulated-use method
demonstrated that a duodenoscope can be sterilized in the presence
of organic and inorganic soils. Furthermore, high-risk materials sus-
ceptible to potential degradation with repetitive processing were
able to be effectively sterilized. Finally, duodenoscopes that were
clinically soiled were sterilized in a health care facility.
Limitations of the study
The conclusions from the clinical in-use study are limited by the
small sample size. As clinical endoscopy studies include uncontrolled
248
V. Molloy-Simard et al. / American Journal of Infection Control 47 (2019) 243−250
 variables, such as bioburden load, endoscope age and condition,
patient soil composition, and hospital practice, the conclusions of
the in-use clinical study would be strengthened by including duode-
noscope samples from additional health care facilities.
In addition, the elevator mechanism was sampled using a flush-
brush-flush method, while the internal duodenoscope channels were
sampled with a flush-only method. The use of a flush-only method
for the channels is recognized as a potential limitation compared
with use of a flush-brush-flush method. A study by Alfa et al, pub-
lished in 2017,63 stated that a flush-only method with the use of a
tensioactive agent such as Tween 80 seemed less effective than a
flush-brush-flush method and that the potential role of such agents
in terms of sample extraction efficiency from endoscope channels
needed to be further evaluated. Also, a study by Alfa et al published
in 201764 stated that the use of a flush-brush-flush method improved
recovery of bacteria in biofilms. However, this study does not provide
a statistically significant difference between a flush-only and a flush-
brush-flush method, explained by Alfa et al, owing to the limited
sample size. Both of these studies were published after the testing
presented in this article. In contrast, a study by Brandabur et al61 con-
cluded that among the 4 methods of sampling used in their large-
scale 4,032 specimens study (flush-only and flush-brush-flush meth-
ods), no significant differences were detected, since the standard
deviation was higher within an individual sampling method than
between the different sampling methods.
