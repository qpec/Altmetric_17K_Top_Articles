from a cave bacterium

Antibiotic resistance is ancient and widespread in environmental bacteria. These are there-
fore reservoirs of resistance elements and reflective of the natural history of antibiotics and
resistance. In a previous study, we discovered that multi-drug resistance is common in
bacteria isolated from Lechuguilla Cave, an underground ecosystem that has been isolated
from the surface for over 4 Myr. Here we use whole-genome sequencing, functional genomics
and biochemical assays to reveal the intrinsic resistome of Paenibacillus sp. LC231, a cave
bacterial isolate that is resistant to most clinically used antibiotics. We systematically link
resistance phenotype to genotype and in doing so, identify 18 chromosomal resistance
elements, including five determinants
without characterized homologues
and three
mechanisms not previously shown to be involved in antibiotic resistance. A resistome
comparison across related surface Paenibacillus affirms the conservation of resistance over
millions of years and establishes the longevity of these genes in this genus.

 U
nderstanding the evolution and origins of antibiotic
resistance genes is vital to predicting, preventing and
managing this global health problem. Studies over the
past decade have revealed that antibiotic resistance is common
in contemporary and ancient environmental bacteria, and that
the associated genes are similar or identical to those circu-
lating in pathogens1. Isolation of metagenomes from samples of
5,000–30,000-year-old permafrost reveals an abundance of resis-
tance elements able to protect against penicillin, tetracycline,
aminoglycoside and glycopeptide antibiotics2,3. This is consistent
with surveys of modern non-pathogenic environmental bacteria
and metagenomes that show that the antibiotic resistome, the
collection of all antibiotic resistance elements, is extensive in
the microbial world, as well as genetically and mechanistically
varied4–8. Antibiotic resistance and the resistome are therefore
ancient, highly diverse and globally distributed.
While resistance is a natural phenomenon, what has changed
since the beginning of the antibiotic era is a marked increase in
selection for mobile resistance elements and consequently,
accretion of drug resistant pathogenic and non-pathogenic
bacteria. Furthermore, the diversity of resistance in individual
strains and the combination of multiple genes on a single genetic
platform are reaching new heights. Some bacteria harbour dozens
of acquired resistance elements often conferring redundant
protection against individual antibiotics. It is clear that where
antibiotic use is abundant, a plethora of resistance elements is
expected. This is consistent with the extensive intrinsic resistomes
of soil bacteria, such as actinomycetes that also produce many
antibiotics4,5. Soil bacteria are rich in resistance elements because
there are many antibiotic producers in the soil; similarly, acquired
antibiotic resistance is common in bacterial strains causing
disease in intensive care units, manured soils, and other clinical
and agricultural sites where antibiotic use is intense9–12.
In a previous survey of antibiotic resistance in a panel of
bacterial strains isolated from Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico, we
found that multi-drug resistance was common in Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria. The deeper portions of Lechuguilla
Cave have been isolated from the surface for over 4 Myr, with no
animals or metazoans living in this environment13,14. The energy
that powers the cave microbial ecosystem is largely acquired
through
chemolithrotrophic
means,
with
no
exposure
to
exogenous antimicrobial compounds. In our initial study of
Lechuguilla Cave bacteria, we identified Paenibacillus sp. LC231
as a strain showing a remarkable drug resistance phenotype that
included the lipopeptide daptomycin, the last novel antibiotic
scaffold to be introduced to the clinic. Here we systematically
probe the intrinsic resistome of Paenibacillus sp. LC231 through
whole-genome sequencing and functional genomics, and identify
several new resistance elements. The result is a compre-
hensive analysis of resistance genotype and phenotype from a
bacterial
strain
isolated
geologically
and
temporally
from
contemporary surface members of the same genus and species.
We report both a remarkable conservation of resistance mecha-
nisms over millions of years and also the discovery of five new
resistance elements that we now realize are widespread in the
environment and thus potential sources of clinical concern
should they be mobilized into pathogens.
Results
Paenibacillus sp. LC231 is multi-drug resistant. We generated a
quantitative antibiogram for Paenibacillus sp. LC231 for 40
different antibiotics that target diverse cellular processes and
compared it with the susceptibility of a surface strain of
Paenibacillus lautus ATCC 43898, the pathogen Staphylococcus
aureus RN4220 and the environmental bacterium Kocuria
rhizophila
(formerly
identified
as
Micrococcus
luteus)
(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Paenibacillus does not have
specified minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values to define
resistance; therefore, in this study, resistance is relative to
K. rhizophila and S. aureus. Further experiments in this study
investigate the molecular basis of resistance and not the con-
tribution of each genetic determinant to the resistance phenotype
of Paenibacillus sp. LC231. Both species of Paenibacillus had
MICs at least 8 � higher than K. rhizophila or S. aureus for
26 antibiotics and, in general, were significantly more resistant to
these antibiotics. We focused our investigation on Paenibacillus sp.
LC231 and determined that in addition to resistance to 14 classes of
antibiotic, it inactivates 7 distinct classes.
Sequencing the Paenibacillus sp. LC231 genome followed by
analysis of resistance genotype using the Comprehensive Anti-
biotic Resistance Database (CARD)15 enabled comparison of the
resistance genotype with experimentally determined phenotype
(Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 1). These correlated well for many
antibiotic classes. For example, decreased rifampin sensitivity was
consistent with mutation in the drug target RpoB (Ala473Thr)
and the presence of a predicted rifampin phosphotransferase-
encoding gene (rph) that may inactivate these drugs by

 phosphorylation of the hydroxyl at C21 of the ansa chain16. Our
informatic analysis identified an orthologue of the 23S ribosomal
RNA
(rRNA)
methyltransferase
Cfr
(95%
identical
to
the characterized Cfr-like enzyme ClPa from Paenibacillus
sp. Y412MC40 (ref. 17)), which is consistent with slightly decr-
eased sensitivity to linezolid, pleuromutilin, streptogramin A,
lincosamide and chloramphenicol antibiotics. In addition to the
Rph, our analysis further predicted that the Paenibacillus
sp. LC231 genome encodes several orthologues of antibiotic-
inactivating enzymes: a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Cat),
a streptogramin B lyase (Vgb), streptogramin A acetyltransferase
(Vat) and a macrolide kinase (Mph), all of which confer drug
resistance when heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli
(Table 1; Supplementary Table 3). We overexpressed and purified
each enzyme and confirmed their catalytic activity using high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectro-
metry (MS; Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4).
We were unable to match some of the antibiotic resistance
phenotypes of Paenibacillus sp. LC231 to specific genes using
CARD, including resistance to bacitracin, clindamycin, capreo-
mycin, mupirocin, tetracycline, tiamulin, kanamycin and kasu-
gamycin. These resistance determinants could be the results of
novel genes or significantly divergent from known mechanisms
such that CARD did not recognize them. We therefore cons-
tructed a Paenibacillus sp. LC231 genomic library in E. coli and
selected for clones that confer resistance to these antibiotics
in this heterologous host (Fig. 1; Table 1; Supplementary Tables
1, 3 and 4). Using this functional genomics strategy, we identified
a putative isoleucyl-transfer RNA synthetase conferring resistance
to mupirocin, a predicted 23S rRNA methyltransferase that
confers resistance to clindamycin, and enzymes that inactivate
capreomycin, kanamycin and kasugamycin, respectively. We
identified the bacitracin resistance gene by screening clones for
bacitracin-modifying
activity
using
an
overlay
technique.
E. coli is naturally insensitive to bacitracin and therefore we
overlayed bacitracin-sensitive K. rhizophila over the E. coli
housing the genomic library to identify bacitracin-inactivating
activity. These new resistance elements are discussed below.
We also identified two predicted ABC-transporters that confer
resistance to tetracycline (TetAB(48)) and tiamulin (TaeA).
All resistance determinants were found on the Paenibacillus
sp. LC231 chromosome and there is no evidence of nearby mobile
elements.
BahA is an amidohydrolase that inactivates bacitracin. Baci-
tracin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by sequestering the lipid II
carrier, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate and prevents it from being
recycled. The antibiotic forms six hydrogen bonds with the
pyrophosphate
of
undecaprenyl
pyrophosphate;
five
that
are made by the peptide backbone and one that is made by the
amido side chain of asparagine-12 (Fig. 2a,b). High-resolution
MS established that the inactivated product had a mass increase
of 0.9844 Da over bacitracin (Fig. 2c,d). This change in mass
is consistent with hydrolysis of –NH2. We determined the
structure of the inactivated product using tandem MS and
revealed that asparagine-12 was hydrolysed to an aspartate
(Fig. 2c; Supplementary Table 5).
The functional genomic strategy designed to identify anti-
biotic-inactivating enzymes led to the three unique bacitracin-
inactivating clones. Sequencing each of the fragments revealed a
single common gene encoding a hypothetical membrane protein
(BahA) that is related to the PF12695 family (alpha/beta-
hydrolase, e-value: 7.1 � 10 � 14). We demonstrated that bahA
confers bacitracin resistance when heterologously expressed in
E. coli BL21(DE3) (Table 1) and inactivates bacitracin consistent
with
amidohydrolysis
(Supplementary
Table
4).
BahA
is
predicted to be made up of two domains; an N-terminal domain
with five transmembrane helices and a large C-terminal hydrolase
domain.
CpaA is a novel capreomycin acetyltransferase. Functional
genomic assays to identify capreomycin resistance elements
identified one unique genome fragment, encoding a hypothetical
protein that is related to GCN5 family of acetyltransferases
(PF13523;
e-value:
GNAT_1
acetyltransferase,
8.18 � 10 � 6)
without a known homologue. In an enzyme assay using purified
CpaA the mass of inactivated capreomycin product was con-
sistent with acetylation, confirming that this enzyme is a
capreomycin
acetyltransferase
(Supplementary
Table
4).
Capreomycin inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the inter-
face of the 50S and 30S ribosomal subunits, preventing translo-
cation. Capreomycin acetylation has previously been shown to be
catalysed
by
the
unrelated
mycobacterial
Eis
enzymes;
promiscuous enzymes that acetylate several, structurally distinct
substrates with free amines, including capreomycin, aminogly-
cosides and ciprofloxacin18. Acetylating the e-amino group of the

 b-lysine by Eis confers resistance to capreomycin. To determine if
CpaA
specifically
inactivates
capreomycin,
we
probed
for
acetylation of kanamycin (an aminoglycoside) and viomycin,
a structurally similar antibiotic with b-lysine on diaminopro-
prionate at position 1 instead of 3. CpaA was unable to acety-
late kanamycin or viomycin (Fig. 3a). We elucidated the structure
of acetyl-capreomycin and determined that CpaA inactivates
capreomycin by acetylating the a-amino group of diaminopro-
pionic acid at position 1, which is absent in viomycin (Fig. 3b,
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data in Supplementary Fig. 2
and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). Using steady-state kinetics,
we determined the Km for capreomycin to be sub-micromolar
(0.76±0.12 mM; Supplementary Table 6) with a specificity
constant (kcat/Km) of 6.7 � 105 M � 1s � 1; values almost three
orders of magnitude lower than those of Eis (654±45 mM and
1.9 � 103 M � 1s � 1).
MphI is a macrolide kinase with unique substrate specificity.
Macrolides are composed of a C14, C15 or C16 macrolactone ring
and are tailored with a variety of sugars—at least one amino sugar
is always on the C5 position. These antibiotics bind the ribosome
at the peptidyltransferase centre and modulate translation19.
Inactivation of this family can occur by addition of a phosphate
onto the 20 OH of the amino sugar13,20. Paenibacillus sp. LC231 is
resistant to many macrolide antibiotics and we identified a
potential macrolide kinase-encoding gene (mphI) in the draft
genome. Overexpression and purification of MphI confirmed the
predicted
enzyme
activity
(Fig.
4;
Supplementary
Fig.
2;
Supplementary Table 6). Consistent with the Paenibacillus sp.
LC231 macrolide resistance phenotype; spiramycin,
tylosin
and
telithromycin
are
inactivated,
whereas
azithromycin,
clarithromycin and azithromycin are not. We hypothesized that
these macrolides are not MphI substrates because they all share
the presence of a C3-cladinose. We removed the C3-cladinose of
clarithromycin using acid hydrolysis to produce descladinose
clarithromycin (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Figs 3 and 4; Supple-
mentary Table 9) and determined that this derivative was indeed
a substrate for MphI thus confirming the narrow specificity of the
enzyme (Fig. 4b–d).

 LlmA modulates sensitivity to peptidyltransferase antibiotics.
We identified a clindamycin resistance gene that is related to the
RlmK 23S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase COG family
(COG1,092, e-value: 1.52 � 10 � 36). Clindamycin targets the
peptidyltransferase
centre
and
inhibits
protein
synthesis
by interfering with transfer RNA binding at the A-site. Bacteria
have evolved enzymes that methylate the ribosome to prevent
binding of several peptidyltransferase centre-binding antibiotics.
LlmA only confers resistance to clindamycin (Table 1) and in
fact
increases
sensitivity
to
pleuromutilins
and
linezolid
(Supplementary Table 10).
Resistance enzymes are variably shared among Paenibacillus.
We conducted a pan-Paenibacillus analysis of the resistance
enzymes identified in this study to determine if any were recently
acquired by Paenibacillus sp. LC231. To this end, we constructed
a species tree of Paenibacillus using high-quality genome
sequences (Supplementary Fig. 5). We then compared resistance
enzymes among strains in a single clade containing Paenibacillus
sp. LC231 (Fig. 5). Cpa, Mph, Vgb and Bah only appear in group
1, while Vat, Rph and Llm appear in all groups. Sequence
diversity of enzymes did not always match with species diversity.
We found that Paenibacillus vortex and Paenibacillus sp. FSL
R5-808 are the most closely related strains to Paenibacillus sp.
LC231, but their Vat enzymes are only 55% identical to VatI. In
contrast, the Vat from Paenibacillus lactis is 94% identical to VatI.
We analysed the genetic context of the vat genes in group 1 and
found
that
neighbouring
genes
were
not
conserved;
vat genes were found in four distinct contexts among the six
strains (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, the cpa neighbouring genes are
variable and cpa can even be lost (Fig. 5c). P. lautus ATCC 43898
is a closely related type strain (16S gene sequence is 99% identical
to that of Paenibacillus sp. LC231). We generated a quantitative
antibiogram for this organism that was very similar to that of
Paenibacillus sp. LC231 from Lechuguilla Cave, demonstrating
that this multi-drug resistant phenotype is native to a clade within
the Paenibacillus genus (Supplementary Table 2).
Antibiotic-modifying
enzymes
are
specific
and
efficient.
The pan-genome comparison of resistance enzymes revealed
that, based on amino-acid sequence, they are conserved within
closely related Paenibacillus, but they are also divergent from
their characterized orthologues. We therefore performed steady-
state kinetic analyses of each antibiotic-modifying enzyme
(Supplementary Table 6). All were found to be effective catalysts
at
converting
antibiotics
into
inactive
products
(kcat/Km
104 � 105). Aminoglycoside acetyltransferases can often modify a
variety of aminoglycosides and we therefore evaluated the ability
of AAC(20)-IIb to modify a range of aminoglycosides. AAC(20)-
IIb specifically modified kasugamycin and no other aminogly-
cosides (Supplementary Fig. 6). AAC(20)-IIa, a mobile resistance
element in Acidovorax avenae ssp. avenae, is the only char-
acterized homologue to AAC(20)-IIb (ref. 21). The AAC(20)-IIb
Km for kasugamycin (44±2 mM) is an order of magnitude lower
than for AAC(20)-IIa (475.3±141.2 mM) and the turnover
number (kcat) for AAC(20)-IIb (2.95±0.03 s � 1) is threefold
higher than for AAC(20)-IIa (0.91±0.18 s � 1).
Discussion
The origins of antibiotic resistance elements in the clinic have
long been debated, but it is evident that non-pathogenic bacteria
harbour numerous and diverse resistance genes orthologous and
even identical to those emerging in pathogens. Here we show that
careful exploration of the resistance genotype and phenotype
of a single environmental organism can yield remarkable
resistance diversity. This single organism is resistant to 26 of 40
antibiotics tested, and harbours five new resistance mechanisms
and 12 orthologues of known resistance gene families. No
resistance determinant from Paenibacillus sp. LC231 is found on
mobile elements and therefore the risk of mobilization is low.

 Lechuguilla Cave is isolated from the surface and direct
interaction of Paenibacillus sp. LC231 with pathogens is unlikely.
However, our results demonstrate that surface Paenibacillus also
have the same collection of resistance genes as LC231. More
studies are needed to investigate the risk of genetic transfer from
surface Paenibacillus to pathogens. The resistance genes in this
study are functional in a heterologous host (E. coli) and could be
selected for if combined with mobile elements. Our findings are
consistent with metagenomics studies of waste water treatment
plants22, where most resistance genes are found native to the
chromosome.
By combining genome sequence analysis, functional genomics
and follow-up biochemical confirmation studies, we established
a robust protocol to efficiently mine the intrinsic resistome
of Paenibacillus sp. LC231. Our approach, which combines
mining of genome sequences, functional genomics and rigorous
biochemical study is widely applicable for dissecting bacterial
resistomes, particularly for wild-type organisms without estab-
lished genetic tools available for gene deletion studies. Further-
more, we show that even though this bacterium has been isolated
from surface members of the same genus for millions of years, it
retains a common multi-drug resistance genotype, although
individual genes have diverged. While the resistance genes are not
unique to Paenibacillus sp. LC231, the entire collection is not
absolutely
conserved
among
all
closely
related
surface
Paenibacillus.
These results speak to the pervasiveness and diversity of
resistance in non-pathogenic environmental bacteria despite a
lack of human intervention. This provides a reservoir of
resistance elements that is substantial. The selective pressure of
the misuse of antibiotics and the accumulation of residues in the
environment should therefore be avoided lest these genes find
opportunity to mobilize through bacterial populations, eventually
making their way into pathogens.

 Methods
Antibiotics and reagents. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Oakville, Ontario, Canada) unless otherwise specified. Acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
was purchased from BioShop (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Organic solvents were
purchased from Fisher Scientific (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Telithromycin was
purified from the pharmaceutical formulation Ketek (400 mg, Sanofi-Aventis US).
Briefly, pills were crushed in a mortar and pestle, dissolved in acetonitrile at 40 �C,
passed through an Amicon Ultra-15 10 kDa centrifugal filter unit and lyophilized.
Linopristin and flopristin were gifts from AstraZeneca.
Growth conditions and genomic DNA isolation. Paenibacillus sp. LC231 was
isolated from Lechuguilla Cave, as described13. To identify the potential for
contamination by surface bacterial isolates, culture and preparation controls
were used throughout sampling. Culture controls consistent of diluent and culture
media mock-inoculated in the cave with sterile swabs, while preparation controls
included all prepared media. All controls were incubated in the laboratory for
30 days under cave-relevant conditions (20 �C in the dark). None of the controls
demonstrated any microbial growth, confirming that all observed colonies
represented indigenous cave isolates. P. lautus ATCC 43898 was obtained from
Cedarlane (Burlington, Canada). Paenibacillus strains were streaked from glycerol
stocks ( � 80 �C) onto Tryptic Soy Agar and incubated at 30 �C for 2 days and
cultures were re-streaked a second time before use. Several colonies with different
growth phenotypes (that is, stationary and motile colonies) were always used for
the experiments to ensure reproducibility. Paenibacillus vortex is a closely related
strain that is also motile. Previous work in this strain has demonstrated that the
stationary and motile colonies can have different antibiotic resistance
phenotypes23. We found that using multiple colonies increased the reproducibility
of our experiments. Liquid cultures were incubated with shaking (250 r.p.m.)
at 30 �C for 2 days unless otherwise specified. The cell pellet from 3 ml of
Paenibacillus sp. LC231 cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB) was used for genomic
DNA isolation using a PureLink genomic DNA mini kit (Invitrogen). E. coli
TOP10 (Invitrogen) was cultured in LB-Lennox and ampicillin (100 mg ml � 1) or
kanamycin (50 mg ml � 1) were added to cultures harbouring plasmids. S. aureus
RN4220 (gift from Dr Eric Brown, McMaster University) was cultured on LB agar,
and Staphylococcus saprophyticus ATCC 15305 and a strain of K. rhizophila
isolated from the soil by our lab (16s rRNA is 99% identical to K. rhizophila ATCC
9341) were cultured on Tryptic Soy Agar. E. coli strains were cultured in LB-
Lennox (10 g typtone, 5 g yeast extract and 5 g NaCl).
Genome sequencing and resistance prediction using the RGI. The
Paenibacillus sp. LC231 genome was sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq with
the Reagent Kit v2 and paired-end 250 bp reads. Spades v3.5.0 was used to
assembly the genome. The Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) v3 (beta, accessed
on 21 August 2015) was used to annotate resistance genes based on the
curated CARD15.
Antimicrobial susceptibility and inactivation assays. Antimicrobial suscept-
ibility experiments followed Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
guidelines for determining the MIC of compounds using the broth microdilution
method24 with the following modifications. For Paenibacillus strains, the saline
suspension was made from several colonies with different growth phenotypes to
ensure reproducibility. Ninety-six-well plates were incubated without shaking at
30 �C for 2 days (for Paenibacillus and K. rhizophila) or overnight at 37 �C (S.
aureus and E. coli). Each MIC was performed in duplicate. Inactivation
experiments for Paenibacillus sp. LC231 were set-up in the following way except
for kasugamycin and capreomycin (see below). Antibiotics were added at 1
4 MIC to
3 ml of Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) and inoculated as described above but with
shaking. Cells were removed by centrifugation at 21,000g for 5 min and the
supernatant was assayed for antibiotic activity using a Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion
assay and K. rhizophila or S. saprophyticus as the indicator organism. Inactivation
was defined as a significant decrease in the zone-of-inhibition when compared with
the sterile control.
Capreomycin and kasugamycin inactivation experiments were performed
using Paenibacillus sp. LC231 lysate. A 250 ml culture in TSB was centrifuged
at 10,000g and the cell pellet was washed with saline. The pellet was resuspended
in 5 ml of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM
b-mercaptoethanol, and cells were lysed at 30,000 psi using a One Shot cell
disrupter (Constant Systems, Ltd.). The lysate was clarified by centrifuging at
18,000g for 20 min. Inactivation of capreomycin and kasugamycin was evaluated
in a 50 ml reaction and the following conditions: 25 ml of clarified lysate in 50 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.5 mg ml � 1 of capreomycin or
kasugamycin. The reactions were incubated at room temperature overnight and an
equal volume of cold methanol was added. Samples were stored at � 20 �C
overnight and then centrifuged at 21,000g. Control experiments used 25 ml of
clarified lysate that was boiled for 10 min. Antibiotic modification was evaluated
using LC–MS. Reactions were analysed by injecting 10 ml onto an Agilent 1100
Series LC system and a QTRAP LC/MS/MS System (ABSciex). The reverse-phase
HPLC conditions are as follows: isocratic 5% solvent B (0.05% formic acid in
acetonitrile), 95% solvent A (0.05% formic acid in water) over 1 min, followed by
a linear gradient to 97% B over 7 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min � 1 and C18 column
(Sunfire, 5 mm, 4.6 � 50 mm).
Paenibacillus sp. LC231 library construction. Genomic DNA (20 mg) was frag-
mented to 5 kb with a Couvaris S220 focused-ultrasonicator using red Minitubes
(Covaris). Sheared DNA was end repaired with Fast DNA End Repair Kit
(Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The End-Repair
reaction (200 ml) contained 50 ml sheared DNA, 20 ml buffer and 10 ml enzyme mix.
The repaired DNA was run on a 1% low-melting point agarose gel (1 � TAE) and
fragments between 3 and 8 kb were excised using the GeneJET gel extraction kit
(Thermo Scientific). Fragmented DNA was further purified using a GeneJET
PCR purification kit (Thermo Scientific). Fragments were ligated into the
SmaI restriction site of pUC19 in a 30 ml reaction (1.5 ml T4 DNA ligase
(Thermo Scientific), 6 ml Fast Ligation buffer (Thermo Scientific), 120 ng SmaI
digested pUC19 and 810 ng fragmented DNA) and incubated at room temperature
for 2 h. E. coli ElectroMax DH10B electrocompetent cells (200 ml, Invitrogen)
were transformed by electroporation with 5 ml of the ligation reaction and recov-
ered in 9 ml of SOC media for 2 h at 37 �C and then plated evenly across 15 LB agar
plates with ampicillin and incubated at 37 �C overnight. A measure of 5 ml of LB
was added to each agar plate to facilitate scraping of E. coli clones. Resuspended
cells from all plates were combined, washed in LB and resuspended in 25 ml LB
with 15% glycerol and stored in 1 ml aliquots at � 80 �C. Average fragment size
was estimated by purifying plasmids from 12 clones and PCR amplifying the
inserts using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) with M13 forward
and reverse sequencing primers.
Selection of antibiotic resistant clones. The Paenibacillus sp. LC231 genomic
library in E. coli was plated at a density of 6–7 � the number of unique clones
obtained in the transformation experiment. A measure of 3 ml of the library glycerol
stock was diluted in 3 ml of warm LB and incubated with shaking for 1 h at 37 �C.
Then, 200 ml was spread on pre-warmed LB agar plates with binary combinations
of 100 mg ml � 1 ampicillin and one of the following antibiotics: 20 mg ml � 1
tetracycline, 50 mg ml � 1 kanamycin, 400 mg ml � 1 capreomycin, 400 mg ml � 1
kasugamycin, 500 mg ml � 1 tiamulin, 200 mg ml � 1 clindamycin and 100 mg ml � 1
mupirocin. Plates were incubated at 37 �C overnight with the exception of
clindamycin, which was incubated an additional day at room temperature.
Resistant clones were confirmed by replica plating onto media with 1–4 � the
antibiotic concentration. Unique clones were identified using colony-PCR with
M13 forward and reverse sequencing primers. Pure plasmids were submitted for
Sanger sequencing (MOBIX, McMaster University, Canada). The results of Sanger
sequencing were mapped to the assembled genome visualized in Geneious.
The complete nucleic acid sequence of the insert was inferred from the genomic
region between the mapped Sanger reads. Enzyme function of potential resistance
enzymes (for example, acetyltransferase and hydrolase) was predicted by matching
the protein sequence to a Pfam25.
Identification of BahA. E. coli is naturally insensitive to bacitracin. The library
glycerol stock described above was diluted 2 � 10 � 6 in LB and 200 ml was spread
on 35 LB agar plates containing ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 �C to
produce B300-well separated colonies. Each plate was replica plated onto two
additional plates and incubated overnight at 37 �C. One plate, to be used to pick
bacitracin-inactivating clones, contained ampicillin and was stored at 4 �C.
The other plate lacked ampicillin and was overlaid with 5 ml of MHB with 0.75%
agar and 4 mg ml � 1 zinc bacitracin. These plates were further incubated at 37 �C
overnight to permit bacitracin inactivation by a clone expressing a bacitracin-
modifying enzyme. An overnight culture of K. rhizophila was diluted one in three
in sterile saline and spread on each plate using a cotton swab, which was then
incubated at 30 �C for an additional two days. The bacitracin concentration used in
this experiment is 2 � the MIC of K. rhizophila under these conditions and
completely inhibits colony formation. E. coli clones with a halo of yellow
K. rhizophila growth were identified as expressing a bacitracin-inactivating enzyme.
To confirm this result, the corresponding colonies from the replica plate were used
to inoculate 3 ml of LB with 200 mg ml � 1 zinc bacitracin. BahA was identified by
Sanger sequencing.
Construction of a Paenibacillus species tree. A Paenibacillus species tree
was generated using 10 housekeeping genes; atpD, dnaA, gyrB, pgi, pyrH,
recA, rpoB, sucC, topA and trpB26. Sequenced Paenibacillus strains with full
sequences for all 10 housekeeping genes were used in phylogenetic analysis,
except Paenibacillus vortex, which did not have an intact topA sequence
(Supplementary Table 11)27. Bacillus megaterium DSM319 (CP001982.1) and
Brevibacillus brevis NBRC 100599 (AP008955.1) were used as an outgroup.
Each housekeeping gene was aligned with MAFFT (L-INS-i)28, trimmed with
TrimAl v. 1.4 rev15 using the automated1 setting29, and concatenated. A
maximum-likelihood tree was generated using RAxML with rapid Bootstrap
analysis on 1,000 replicates. ’X’s were used in place of the missing Paenibacillus
topA sequence. All genome sequences were accessed on 10 July 2015.

 Cloning of resistance genes and susceptibility testing. Cloning is summarized
in Supplementary Table 12. TaeA and TetAB(48) are ABC-transporters composed
of one and two polypeptides, respectively. Primers were designed to amplify 500 bp
upstream of tetAB(48) so to clone both genes with their native promoter in pUC19.
Similarly, taeA was cloned into pUC19 with the 500 bp upstream region. E. coli
TOP10 expressing either TetAB(48) or TaeA were used in MIC experiments.
The C-terminal domain of bahA (corresponding to residues 200–756) was first
cloned into pET11a, then PCR-amplified with the upstream ribosome-binding
site and XbaI-restriction site and cloned into pET21a, which includes an in frame
C-terminal His6-tag. The pET11a-bahA construct was transformed into E. coli
BL21(DE3) for MIC experiments. In bacitracin inactivation experiments, 3 ml of
LB containing 200 mg ml � 1 bacitracin was inoculated with either E. coli BL21(DE3)
pET11a or E. coli BL21(DE3) pET11a-bahA and cultured with shaking overnight.
Inactivation was assayed using a Kirby–Bauer assay and using LC–electrospray
ionization (ESI)–MS as described above. The pET21a constructs of aac(20)-IIb and
aac(60)-34 were used for MIC experiments. All pET vectors were transformed into
E. coli BL21(DE3) for MIC experiments.
Pan-Paenibacillus resistance enzyme analysis. Orthologues of ten resistance
enzymes from Paenibacillus sp. LC231 (RphB, VatI, AAC(20)-IIb, AAC(60)-34,
MphI, CatU, VgbC, LlmA, CpaA and BahA) were identified in a subset of
Paenibacillus genomes using an extended BLASTp method. Briefly, each protein
sequence (for example, RphB and VatI) was queried against GenBank limited to
txid44249 (Paenibacillus) with an e-value cutoff of 1 � 10 � 10. Enzymes that were
at least 50% identical over at least 80% of the seed sequence were in turn queried
against GenBank to identify more diverse Paenibacillus orthologues using the
same BLAST parameters. The pair-wise sequence identity of each enzyme with
its orthologue in Paenibacillus sp. LC231 was computed with Clustal Omega30
per cent identity matrix and plotted as a colour gradient from 45% (the most
diverse orthologue) in black to 100% in red. For genomic context analysis,
sequence and annotations for 5 kb upstream and downstream of each gene
were extracted from GenBank files using RefSeq annotations. Arrows representing
genes were made in Geneious. Genes from Paenibacillus sp. LC231 were manually
annotated using BLASTx.
Purification of antibiotic inactivating enzymes. Antibiotic-inactivating enzymes
were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein overexpression. A 3 ml
overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 l of LB and incubated with shaking at
37 �C with either kanamycin (pET28a) or ampicillin (pET11a, pET21a or pET22b)
until an OD600 of 0.6–0.8, at which point the cultures were placed in an ice bath for
20 min and protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thioga-
lactopyranoside at 16 �C overnight. Cells were collected at 5,000g for 20 min and
washed in cold saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mM HEPES
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 5 mM imidazole (buffer A) and lysed using
a One Shot cell disrupter (Constant Systems, Ltd.) at 20,000 psi. A measure of 5 mg
of bovine pancreas DNase, 2.5 mg of bovine pancreas RNase and an additional
15 ml of buffer were added and centrifuged at 40,000g for 45 min. Overexpressed
proteins were purified using ion-metal affinity chromatography (1 ml Ni2 þ-
nitrilotriacetic acid column, Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A. A linear gradient
was used to elute protein over 20 column volumes starting at 94:6 buffer A: buffer B
to 100% buffer B (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 250 mM
imidazole) on an A
¨ KTA purifier (GE Scientific). Fractions containing pure protein
were identified using SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled and desalted
with 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 using a PD-10 gel filtration column (GE), except
for CatU and VatI where the buffer contained 150 mM NaCl. In addition, 0.1 mM
b-mercaptoethanol was added to purified CatU. Pure enzyme stocks were stored
at 4 �C.
MS of antibiotics inactivated by purified enzymes. The predicted catalytic
functions of CpaA, VatI, MphI, CatU, VgbC, RphB, AAC(20)-IIb and AAC(60)-34
were confirmed with LC–MS analysis of enzyme reactions. Each 250 ml reaction
consisted of 1 mg ml � 1 antibiotic, 60–90 mg ml � 1 of enzyme and 1 � reaction
buffer (see below). Specific enzyme/substrate combinations were as follows;
CpaA/capreomycin, VatI/flopristin, MphI/telithromycin, CatU/chloramphenicol,
VgbC/linopristin, RphB/rifampin, AAC(20)-IIb/kasugamycin and AAC(60)-34/
sisomicin. The reaction for CpaA, VatI, CatU and AAC(20)-IIb contained 50 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM acetyl-CoA. The MphI
reaction contained 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 40 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM
GTP. The reaction for VgbC contained 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 1 mM MgCl2.
The reaction for RphB contained 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 40 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM
MgCl2 and 2.5 mM ATP. The AAC(60)-34 reaction contained 25 mM MES pH 6.0,
1 mM EDTA and 1 mM acetyl-CoA. Reactions were incubated at room tempera-
ture overnight. An equal volume of cold methanol was added, stored at � 20 �C
overnight and centrifuged at 21,000g for 10 min. A volume of 10–20 ml of each
reaction was injected onto an Agilent 1100 Series LC system and a QTRAP LC/MS/
MS System using the HPLC conditions described in online methods.
Structural characterization of inactivated bacitracin. A measure of 0.5 ml of a
3 ml overnight Paenibacillus sp. LC231 culture in MHB was used to inoculate 50 ml
of MHB. The culture was centrifuged at 4,000g for 40 min at room temperature,
washed with 10 ml of sterile saline and resuspended in 1.5 ml MHB. A volume
of 750 ml of this suspension was boiled for 10 min as a negative control. Bacitracin
A (2.5 mg ml � 1) was added to the suspension and incubated overnight with
shaking at 30 �C. Cells were removed by centrifuging at 21,000g. An equal volume
of methanol was added, stored at � 20 �C overnight and centrifuged at 21,000g for
10 min. LC–ESI–MSn experiments were performed on a ThermoFisher LTQ-XL-
Orbitrap Hybrid mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, Bremen, Germany) in posi-
tive-ion mode. A volume of 20 ml of the reaction or bacitracin A (1 mg ml � 1) were
injected onto an Agilent 1290 Infinity UPLC system using the following chroma-
tography conditions: isocratic 5% solvent B (0.05% formic acid in acetonitrile),
95% solvent A (0.05% formic acid in water) over 1 min, followed by a linear
gradient to 100% B over 4.5 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min � 1 and C18 column
(info needed). The conditions for ESI–MSn experiments are as follows: sheath
gas flow rate at 40, auxiliary gas flow rate at 10, ion spray voltage at 4.2 kV, capillary
temperature at 340 �C, capillary voltage at 29 V, tube lens voltage at 120 V
and normalized collision energy at 27%. MS1 was set to fourier transform (FT) full
scan between 500–1,700 m/z with a resolution set at 60,000 followed by MS2 and
MS3 of the most intense ions from MS1 and MS2 stages, respectively. Ion fragments
in MS3 were compared with previous reports (Supplementary Table 5)31.
CpaA characterization. CpaA substrate specificity was examined by monitoring
CoA liberation with 4,40-dithiodipyridine (DTDP) at 324 nm. Reactions were
performed at 25 �C in a 96-well plates with a final volume of 250 mM and contained
50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1.7 mM DTDP, 250 mM
acetyl-CoA and 5.6 mg ml � 1 CpaA. Reactions were initiated with the addition of
100 mM capreomycin, kanamycin or viomycin and monitored for 1,000 s. The site
of acetylation was determined using NMR. A large-scale reaction consisted of
25 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 7.8, 12 mg capreomycin (mixture of IA and
IB), 15 mM acetyl-CoA, and 14 mg CpaA in a final volume of 1 ml and was incu-
bated at 25 �C overnight. An additional 10 mM acetyl-CoA and 28 mg CpaA was
added, and the reaction was incubated for 8 h. The solution was lyophilized,
dissolved in 0.5 ml of 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate and the pH was adjusted to
9.0 using ammonium hydroxide. The sample was purified by anion-exchange
chromatography (1 ml Q-sepharose HiTrap XL) and the compound was eluted
in 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 9.0. The eluate was lyophilized and the
compound was further purified using normal-phase flash chromatography
(12 g RediSep Rf silica, Teledyne) and eluted with butanol:acetic acid:water using
a linear gradient from 3:1:1 to 3:3:4 to yield 10 mg acetyl-capreomycin. The
compound was dissolved in 500 ml D2O and 1 ml glacial acetic acid for one-
dimensional and two-dimensional NMR experiments.
The molecular formula of 1-N-acetyl-capreomycin IA was determined as
C27H46N14O9 according to its positive HRESIMS at m/z 711.3633 [M þ H] þ.
Careful comparison of the 1H-NMR data of 1-N-acetyl-capreomycin IA with
those of capreomycin IA showed that H-1 in 1-N-acetyl-capreomycin IA shifted
to downfield 0.23 ppm, H-2a and H-2b shifted to upfield 0.20 and 0.24 p.p.m.,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3; Supplementary Tables. 7 and 8). In the
13C-NMR spectrum, C-16 shifted to downfield 3.9 p.p.m., indicating that a acetyl
group connected to N-1. This connection was further confirmed by key
heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectroscopy correlations from H-1
(at dH 4.60 p.p.m.) to CH3C ¼ O (at dC 174.0 p.p.m.).
MphI characterization. MphI substrate specificity was examined using a coupled
assay32. Reactions were performed in a 96-well plate with a final volume of
250 ml and contained 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 40 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM
NADH, 3.5 mM PEP, 4.8 U PK/LDH, 1 mM GTP and 800 mM macrolide
(erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, tylosin, telithromycin, spiramycin
and roxithromycin). The assay plate was incubated at 37 �C for 5 min and reactions
were initiated by the addition of GTP. Acid hydrolysis was used to remove the
C3-cladinose from clarithromycin. Clarithromycin (19.7 mg, 26.3 mmol) was
added in several portions over 5 min to a mixture of 500 ml water and 50 ml
concentrated HCl. The reaction proceeded at room temperature, with stirring,
for 2 h. The crude material was then purified using reverse-phase flash chromato-
graphy (C18, 5.5 g RediSep Rf Gold column, Teledyne) in a linear gradient of 100%
water to 60:40 water:acetonitrile over 10 min. The fractions containing pure
compound, as determined by LC–MS, were pooled and lyophilized. The compound
structure was confirmed to be descladinose clarithromycin using one-dimensional
and two-dimensional NMR experiments (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5; Supple-
mentary Table 9). The yield was 58.4%. Descladinose clarithromycin was used in
an MphI enzyme assay without PK:LDH in the following reaction; 0.5 mg ml � 1
of descladinose clarithromycin, 22.5 mg MphI and 1 mM GTP in a final volume of
100 ml. A 50 ml aliquot was removed immediately after mixing and the reaction was
