Aging associates with impaired pancreatic islet function and increased type 2 diabetes (T2D)
risk. Here we examine whether age-related epigenetic changes affect human islet function
and if blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect these changes and associate with future
T2D. We analyse DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from 87 non-diabetic donors, aged
26–74 years. Aging associates with increased DNA methylation of 241 sites. These sites
cover loci previously associated with T2D, for example, KLF14. Blood-based epigenetic
biomarkers reflect age-related methylation changes in 83 genes identified in human islets
(for example, KLF14, FHL2, ZNF518B and FAM123C) and some associate with insulin secretion
and T2D. DNA methylation correlates with islet expression of multiple genes, including FHL2,
ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF. Silencing these genes in b-cells alter insulin secretion. Together,
we demonstrate that blood-based epigenetic biomarkers reflect age-related DNA methylation
changes in human islets, and associate with insulin secretion in vivo and T2D.

 A
ging is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes
(T2D)1,2 and the increasing age of the world’s populations
contributes to the rapidly growing prevalence of T2D.
Elderly people often exhibit insulin resistance and progressive
decline in glucose tolerance. Euglycaemia is initially sustained
by an adaptive increase in insulin secretion from the pancreatic
b-cells. However, aging b-cells may eventually fail to adapt
to increasing demands for insulin production, which manifests
in
hyperglycaemia
and
T2D1.
Why
aging
b-cells
fail
is
unclear, and understanding this pathogenetic process could
contribute to understanding the roots of T2D. One possible
factor may be that aging causes epigenetic changes that affect
gene expression and thereby potentially insulin secretion in
pancreatic islets3.
Epigenetic alterations, such as changes in DNA methylation,
have been linked to several diseases, including T2D2–8. We have
previously identified increased DNA methylation and decreased
expression of the insulin gene5 and PDX1 (ref. 6), a key
transcription factor for b-cell development and function, in
pancreatic islets from subjects with T2D. More recently, we
analysed DNA methylation genome-wide in islets from diabetic
subjects and non-diabetic controls and identified multiple genes
with altered methylation and expression in diabetic islets3. These
epigenetic changes were further associated with perturbed islet
hormone secretion, and likely contribute to hyperglycaemia.
Epigenetic variation in human islets seems to also contribute to
sex differences in insulin secretion9. We and others have also
identified some age-related DNA methylation changes in human
islets, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, brain and blood cells3,10–18.
Furthermore,
epigenetic
changes
are
associated
with
islet
dysfunction and hyperglycaemia in aging rats19,20. However, it
remains unknown if aging is associated with genome-wide
changes in DNA methylation of human islets and if these
changes have any effect on islet function and development of
T2D.
The
possibilities
for
following
pancreatic
islet
health
non-invasively are so far largely limited to nutrient-stimulation
of hormone secretion, and analysing epigenetic modifications
in human islets in vivo/non-invasively remains impossible.
There is a great translational scientific and public health
potential in identifying novel biomarkers in blood that mirror
protective or causal disease associated changes in human islets.
Such biomarkers could potentially be used to predict and/or to
monitor disease progression in T2D21.
In this study, we investigate epigenetic modifications and find
that age associates with increased DNA methylation in human
pancreatic
islets.
These
epigenetic
changes
correlate
with
expression of numerous genes and silencing these genes in
b-cells alters insulin secretion. Furthermore, we show that
age-associated methylation changes in blood reflect the changes
seen in islets, suggesting that blood may be used as a marker for
islet DNA methylation. Finally, we investigate prospective cohorts
and show that DNA methylation of some of these genes associates
with future capacity to secrete insulin and T2D risk.
Results
Characteristics
of
human
pancreatic
islet
donors.
The
characteristics of the 87 non-diabetic human pancreatic islet
donors, aged 26–74 years, are shown in Table 1. While aging was
associated with elevated HbA1c levels (P ¼ 0.028 as analysed by
linear
regression,
Supplementary
Fig.
1a),
there
were
no
significant associations between age and body mass index (BMI)
or in vitro glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Supplementary
Fig. 1b,c). Nor was age associated with b- or a-cell content in the
islets (Supplementary Fig. 1d,e).
Age-related DNA methylation changes in human islets. To
unravel the impact of aging on the human pancreatic islet
epigenome, DNA methylation was analysed with the Illumina
Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in islets from the 87
donors. Aging was significantly associated with altered DNA
methylation at 241 sites after correction for multiple testing
(false discovery rate (FDR)o5%, qo0.05, linear regression).
These 241 sites were distributed in 154 genes and intergenic
regions (Supplementary Data 1). Interestingly, methylation of all
significant
sites
increased
with
age.
The
most
significant
associations between age and DNA methylation in human islets
are presented in Fig. 1a. We next evaluated the distribution of
the 241 significant methylation sites based on their relation to the
nearest genes (Fig. 1b) or CpG islands (Fig. 1c)22. The significant
sites were enriched in promoter regions (TSS1500 and TSS200),
first exon and CpG islands, while they were underrepresented in
the gene body, 30 untranslated region, southern shore, shelf
regions and open sea (Fig. 1b,c). None of the probes used to
identify significant sites cross-react to other locations in the
genome with a perfect match (Supplementary Data 2).
To study the impact of a smaller age difference on methylation
in islets, we reanalysed the 241 significant sites from the original
analysis in subjects within an age span of the average age±1 s.d.
(56.7±10.5 years). Here methylation of 125 sites associated with
age (qo0.05, linear regression) and methylation of all these
increased with age (Supplementary Data 3).
Functions of genes with age-related methylation changes. To
further understand the biological relevance of the identified DNA
methylation changes (Supplementary Data 1), we performed a
literature search to investigate potential involvement of the 154
differentially methylated genes in islet function and pathogenesis
of diabetes. The literature search was performed using each gene
name
and
the
following
terms;
diabetes,
pancreatic
islet,
pancreatic b-cells or mitochondrial function. This showed that 30
(19%) of the identified genes have been associated with diabetes,
islet/b-cell function or mitochondrial function, and thus might
be important for insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis
(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 4). These include CCND2,
CILP2, PBX4, SH2B3, SLC6A4, TCF7 and KLF14 (Fig. 2a–g
and Supplementary Data 1 and 4), which have polymorphisms
associated with diabetes risk.
DNA methylation correlates with gene expression in islets.
Since DNA methylation may regulate gene expression23, we
tested whether the identified age-associated methylation changes
correlate with expression of respective nearby annotated gene(s),
including a total of 154 unique genes. Here methylation of 32 sites
correlated with expression of respective gene with Po0.05 and 11
of these with qo0.05 (Spearman’s rank test, Supplementary
Data 5). These include FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF
(Fig. 3). ZNF518B and GNPNAT1 showed inverse correlations

 between DNA methylation and expression (Fig. 3b,c). Indeed,
methylation
in
gene
promoters
can
result
in
diminished
expression by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors or
recruiting methyl CpG-binding proteins together with HDACs
and co-repressors2,23. However, expression of FHL2 and HLTF
correlated positively with the methylation of CpG sites in
respective gene, despite the sites being situated in promoter
regions (Fig. 3a,d). We hypothesised that methylation of these
sites prevent binding of repressive transcription factors, so we
used LASAGNA-Search 2.0 to analyse which factors bind to
stretches of DNA that contain these CpG sites. This showed that
the significant CpG sites in both FHL2 and HLTF promoters
are situated within binding sites for repressive transcription
factors (Supplementary Data 6). Thus, increased methylation
may reverse repression of FHL2 and HLTF and thereby enhance
expression.
We next used luciferase assays to study the impact of altered
DNA methylation in transcriptional regulation of genes presented
in Supplementary Data 5. For this experiment, we selected
ZNF518B and GNPNAT1, two genes where the age-associated
methylation changes take place in promoter regions and with
inverse
correlations

methylation
and

 (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Data 5). Promoter sequences for
ZNF518B
and
GNPNAT1
were
inserted
into
a
luciferase
expression plasmid and each construct was mock-methylated or
methylated with two different methyltransferases, HhaI and SssI.
The number of CpG sites that may be methylated in each
respective construct is shown in Fig. 3e. While SssI methylation
suppressed reporter expression for both genes, HhaI methylation
only suppressed reporter expression for ZNF518B (Fig. 3e).
Interestingly, methylation of the three GCGC sites in the
GNPNAT1 promoter by HhaI led to increased reporter expression
(Fig. 3e). LASAGNA-Search 2.0 analysis showed that two of these
GCGC sites are situated in a binding site for the well-known

 repressor NRSF24,25 (Supplementary Data 7), possibly explaining
this increased reporter expression.
Differentially methylated genes affect insulin secretion. We
next investigated whether genes with age-associated changes
in DNA methylation, and a significant correlation between
methylation and expression, affect insulin secretion in b-cells.
FHL2, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF, four of the most
significant genes presented in Supplementary Data 5 and Fig. 3,
were selected for functional follow-up experiments. We silenced
the expression of Fhl2, Zfp518b (rat homologue of ZNF518B),
Gnpnat1 and Hltf in clonal rat b-cells using short interfering
RNA (siRNA). This reduced expression of respective mRNA by
B65–75% (Fig. 4a). We then measured insulin secretion at
basal (2.8 mM) and stimulatory (16.7 mM) glucose levels in
siRNA-transfected b-cells. While silencing of Fhl2 resulted in
diminished insulin secretion at 16.7 mM glucose, Gnpnat1
deficiency reduced insulin secretion at 2.8 mM glucose (Fig. 4b).
In addition, b-cells deficient for Zfp518b or Hltf expression
exhibited reduced insulin secretion at 2.8 mM glucose and
increased secretion at 16.7 mM glucose (Fig. 4b). These changes
also resulted in altered fold change of insulin secretion (secretion
at stimulatory glucose divided by secretion at basal glucose levels)
in b-cells deficient for Fhl2, Zfp518b, Gnpnat1 or Hltf (Fig. 4c).
In summary, silencing of genes with age-related alteration in
DNA methylation and associated expression changes have
functional effects on clonal b-cells.
Blood-based biomarkers of islet DNA methylation and function.
Epigenetic biomarkers in blood have more clinical potential than
those in pancreatic islets as islets cannot be non-invasively
assessed, so we tested whether age-related DNA methylation
changes in blood cells reflect the epigenetic changes identified
in human pancreatic islets and if they may be used to monitor
insulin secretion in vivo. We first compared our significant
results from human islets with data from a previously published
study, which examined the impact of age on DNA methylation
in leucocytes from a large human cohort; 421 individuals
aged 14–94 years15. Intriguingly, 139 (57.7%) of the 241
methylation sites that significantly associated with age in
pancreatic islets did so also in leucocytes (Supplementary
Data 8). The methylation level of all overlapping sites increased
with age in both islets and leucocytes. Notably, methylation of
numerous of these sites has been reported to associate with age in
blood in additional studies10,12,13 (Supplementary Data 8).
The 139 overlapping sites cover 83 unique genes, including
KLF14,
FHL2,
FAM123C
and
ZNF518B.
Depictions
of
significant associations between age and DNA methylation for
CpG sites in these four genes in human pancreatic islets are
presented in Fig. 5a–d.

 We next used pyrosequencing to experimentally test if we also
could identify these age-related changes in DNA methylation in
blood. However, since we did not have access to blood samples
from the islet donors, we analysed DNA methylation of KLF14,
FHL2,
FAM123C
and
ZNF518B
in
blood
samples
taken
from another cohort of 112 individuals from the Danish Family
Study26,27. We chose these genes as their methylation levels
previously have been found to associate with age in blood (all four
genes, Supplementary Data 8), they showed functional effects in
b-cells (FHL2 and ZNF518B, Fig. 4) or have been associated with
T2D
risk
(KLF14
(refs
28,29)).
We
also
analysed
DNA
methylation in blood of GNPNAT1 and HLTF, which showed
age-associated methylation changes in islets (Supplementary Data
1 and Supplementary Fig. 2, left panels) and had functional effects
in b-cells (Fig. 4), but age-associated methylation changes in
blood have not been described for the studied sites in these two
genes. In the Danish Family Study, blood samples were available
from two time points separated by B10 years and the individuals
had a wide range in age (20–73 years at baseline and 32–83 years
at follow-up, Supplementary Data 9). Importantly, increased age
was significantly associated with increased methylation of KLF14,
FHL2, FAM123C and ZNF518B, in the Danish Family Study at
both baseline and follow-up (Fig. 5a–d and Supplementary
Fig. 3). For GNPNAT1 and HLTF, however, the associations were
negative or non-significant, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Also, the degree of DNA methylation increased for KLF14,
FHL2, FAM123C and ZNF518B from baseline to follow-up
(Supplementary Fig. 4) showing an intra-individual increase in
methylation during aging.
We next used data from the study by Slieker et al.30 to compare
the degree of methylation of the studied sites in KLF14, FHL2,
FAM123C and ZNF518B in blood and pancreas taken from the
same human donors. Most of the sites exhibit similar methylation
levels in blood and pancreas, and the methylation data in the
two tissues correlated significantly (P ¼ 4.2 � 10 � 11 as analysed
by Spearman’s rank test, Supplementary Fig. 5). Together, our
data and the data from the study by Slieker et al.30 support
that age-related methylation changes found in blood in many
cases are similar to methylation changes in pancreatic islets and
potentially can be used as biomarkers for alterations in primary
tissues for diabetes.
Moreover, the pyrosequencing assays used for analysis of KLF14,
FHL2, FAM123C, ZNF518B, GNPNAT1 and HLTF all cover
several methylation sites not included on the methylation array.
These additional methylation sites were in most cases also
significantly associated with age at both baseline and follow-up
(Supplementary Figs 6 and 7), indicating that the sites identified by
the array lie within genomic regions that are increasingly
methylated during aging. It should further be noted that the
degree of baseline and follow-up DNA methylation for all analysed
sites (except cg22285878 in KLF14) correlated significantly for
respective gene (median P value 8.8 � 10� 11 and 1.6 � 10� 10,
respectively, as analysed by Spearman’s rank test).
It is possible that age-associated alterations in blood cell
composition affect our results31,32. To investigate this, we used
data for the studied CpG sites in KLF14, FHL2, FAM123C,
ZNF518B and GNPNAT1 from the study by Reinius et al.33,
where they analysed DNA methylation in isolated blood cell
populations. There were small differences in DNA methylation
between lymphoid and myeloid cell populations for some of these
sites (Supplementary Fig. 8). However, several of these differences
actually strengthen our results as the methylation level is higher
in lymphoid cells than in myeloid cells and aging is associated
with a decline in lymphoid cell numbers31,32.

 negatively associated with disposition index (DI), a measure of
insulin secretion corrected for insulin sensitivity (Table 2).
We proceeded to test if DNA methylation of CpG sites in genes
with age-associated methylation changes identified in both
pancreatic islets and blood (KLF14, FHL2, FAM123C, ZNF518B
and GNPNAT1) associated with measures of insulin secretion in
the Danish Family Study, independent of age, and therefore
can be used as biomarkers for b-cell function. We found that
methylation at baseline of CpG sites in KLF14 and ZNF518B
associated with elevated insulin and C-peptide levels measured
during an OGTT at the same time point (associations with
Po0.05 as analysed by linear mixed effect models are presented
in Table 3). We next tested if DNA methylation of KLF14, FHL2,
FAM123C, ZNF518B and GNPNAT1 measured in blood at
baseline associates with insulin secretion measured at follow-up
in the Danish Family Study. Indeed, DNA methylation in KLF14
and ZNF518B at baseline was significantly associated with altered
insulin levels measured during an OGTT at follow-up after
10.4±0.9 years (associations with Po0.05 as analysed by linear
mixed effect models are presented in Table 4). Together, these
data suggest that epigenetic markers in blood associate with
measures of insulin secretion in vivo and may be used to predict
future capacity to secrete insulin.
DNA methylation associates with future T2D. To investigate
if epigenetic markers associate with risk of future diabetes, we
used pyrosequencing to analyse DNA methylation of KLF14,
FHL2, FAM123C, ZNF518B and GNPNAT1 in blood from
subjects in the Botnia prospective study34 (Supplementary
Data 10). These participants were healthy at baseline and were
followed
prospectively
with
repeated
OGTTs
to
detect
progression to T2D (mean follow-up time 10.8 years)34. Higher
DNA methylation of CpG sites in KLF14, FHL2 and GNPNAT1
was associated with smaller hazard ratios and hence a lower risk
of future T2D (Table 5). The relative risk per 1% increase in
methylation was 0.88 for a site in KLF14, 0.94, 0.92 and 0.82 for
three sites in FHL2, and 0.92 and 0.94 for two sites in GNPNAT1.
Validation of methylation changes in human pancreatic islets.
We finally used pyrosequencing to technically validate and
biologically replicate 7 CpG sites in KLF14, FHL2 and FAM123C
that
exhibit
significant
age-related
methylation
changes in human islets (Fig. 5a–c). Technical validation was
performed on islet DNA from 76 of the donors in the original
450 k array analysis, but the DNA was bisulfite treated on a
different occasion. Importantly, the methylation data generated
with the two methods correlated significantly for all analysed
sites (Supplementary Data 11). To biologically replicate our
methylation data, we analysed methylation of the same 7 CpG
sites in islet samples from 38 donors, ages 19–72, not included in
the
array
analysis
(Supplementary
Data
12).
Importantly,
we could replicate the significant findings on all 7 analysed sites
(Supplementary Fig. 9a–c). In addition, we compared methylation
of the 7 sites in islet donors younger than 40 (n ¼ 6) and older
than 65 (n ¼ 10) years in the validation cohort. This revealed
significantly increased methylation in elderly donors for all sites
(Supplementary Fig. 9d). These data together with our previously
published data3,9,18,35,36 support that the genome-wide analysis of
DNA methylation in islets is robust and that the specificity of the
array analysis is high.
Discussion
Our study shows that aging associates with specific changes of
DNA methylation in human pancreatic islets. These include loci
in genes previously associated with diabetes risk and islet
function. Importantly, we show that some age-related DNA
methylation changes in pancreatic islets were similar in blood,
suggesting that DNA methylation in blood may be used as a
biomarker of DNA methylation in human islets. In addition,
some of these blood-based epigenetic markers correlated with
current and future insulin levels measured in vivo and were
associated with lower risk of future T2D.

 As the possibilities to monitor pancreatic islet function in vivo
are limited, blood-based biomarkers for pancreatic islet function
could have great clinical utility. We show that almost 60% of
age-associated changes in DNA methylation in human islets
occur also in blood. Our functional experiments further show that
altered expression of some of these genes affects insulin secretion.
For example, we show that methylation of FHL2 associates with
age, both in human islets and blood. In addition, the methylation
level correlated with FHL2 expression in islets and silencing Fhl2
decreased insulin secretion in vitro. Furthermore, methylation of
FHL2 in blood was associated with lower T2D risk. Additional
genes showing increased methylation in both pancreatic islets and
blood during aging included KLF14, FAM123C and ZNF518B.
KLF14 encodes a transcriptional regulator and polymorphisms
within this gene have been associated with T2D37. FAM123C
encodes an activator of Wnt signalling38, a pathway important
for b-cells39. Two recent studies have shown that ZNF518B
encodes a protein that regulates histone methyltransferases40
and that a SNP in ZNF518B associates with blood glucose in
patients with gout41. The identified associations between DNA
methylation
and
future
insulin
secretion
or
T2D
risk
demonstrate, for example, that 1% higher DNA methylation of
cg08097417 in KLF14 is associated with 47.3 mU l � 1 higher
insulin secretion during an OGTT B10 years later, while 1%
higher DNA methylation of cg16764848 in GNPNAT1 is
associated with an 8% lower risk for diabetes B11 years later.
It should be noted that these analyses were adjusted for age, sex,
BMI, HbA1c and family status.
DNA methylation was initially thought to be a silencing mark
where increased methylation results in decreased expression23.
However, emerging data show that the effect of DNA methylation
depends on the genomic location and methylation may also affect
transcriptional elongation, transcription of non-coding RNAs,
alternative splicing and genomic stability23. While methylation of
some of our identified sites in, for example, FHL2, ZNF518B,
GNPNAT1 and HLTF was associated with altered expression, the
other identified CpG sites may affect other biological processes.
Interestingly, DNA methylation of all significant sites in
human islets increased with age. This result is in line with
age-associated methylation changes of sites found in other human
tissues where methylation of the majority of sites increased with
age16,18,42. On the other hand, increased age was found to
decrease the global methylation level in human blood, several
rodent tissues and cultured fibroblasts15,43,44. Although tissue-
specific methylome alterations take place, methylation of genes
such as FHL2, KLF14, ELOVL2 and GLRA1 seems to change in
multiple tissues with age. The different mechanisms behind the
tissue specific and more general methylation changes during a
lifetime remain largely unknown. However, whether cells are
replaced (for example, most blood cells) or remain throughout
life
may
affect
the
impact
of
age
on
the
methylome45.
Age-associated effects on the activity of methyltransferases in
different tissues may also contribute to alterations in the
methylome.
As it has been proposed that CpG sites close to each other
show a similar degree of methylation within a tissue and
individual30, it is worth mentioning that 37 of the identified
genes in our study had more than 1 site with age-associated
changes
in
methylation.
In
addition,
when
we
used
pyrosequencing to analyse methylation of sites in FHL2, KLF14,
FAM123C, ZNF518B and GNPNAT1, several surrounding sites
showed altered methylation with age, suggesting that methylation
in genomic regions rather than individual sites change with age.
To investigate if genes with age-associated methylation changes
identified in pancreatic islets may contribute to altered insulin
secretion1, we analysed the effects of Fhl2, Zfp518b, Gnpnat1 and
Hltf knockdown in clonal b-cells. While knockdown of Zfp518b
and Gnpnat1 mimics the age-associated decline in expression
seen
in
human
islets,
knockdown
of
Fhl2
and
Hltf
represents expression changes in the opposite direction of that
seen in aging islets. Interestingly, all four genes affected insulin
secretion.
Of
note,
our
functional
experiments
in
b-cells
suggest that the age-associated changes in methylation of FHL2,
ZNF518B and GNPNAT1 in human islets may be protective and
compensatory changes to cope with increased demands of insulin
due to insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Conversely,
age-associated changes in methylation and expression of HLTF
may increase the risk of T2D. It is noteworthy that FHL2 through
its LIM domains interacts with more than 50 partners involved in
many signalling pathways46. Thus, changing FHL2 expression
could affect different intracellular pathways and overexpression of
Fhl2 in b-cells, that is, replicating the changes associated with
aging, may therefore also reduce insulin secretion. GNPNAT1
encodes an enzyme involved in N-linked glycosylation which is
likely important for normal cellular function. HLTF is believed to
have both DNA helicase and ubiquitinylating properties. To our
knowledge, this is the first time these genes have been implicated
in pancreatic b-cell function. It should be noted that these
functional experiments were performed in a rodent b-cell line
and differences between rodent and human b-cells may affect our
results47. We did try to perform functional experiments in a
human b-cell line (EndoC-bH1), but transfection with a control
siRNA diminished the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion to
levels where interpretation of the effects of knockdown was not
feasible. We also wanted to investigate the effects of KLF14 and
FAM123C knockdown in b-cells. However, although both KLF14
and FAM123C were clearly expressed in human islets and
EndoC-bH1, the expression of these two genes was too low for
reliable detection in the rat b-cell line. Hence, it was impossible to
silence these two genes in rat b-cells.
Aging is a risk factor for T2D, a disease characterised by
chronic hyperglycaemia resulting from impaired insulin secretion
in combination with peripheral insulin resistance. Previous
studies suggest that before insulin secretion fails and diabetes
manifests, b-cells in elderly subjects try to compensate for insulin
resistance with increased insulin secretion to prevent disease1.
In our study, age was associated with elevated HbA1c in donors
of pancreatic islets and participants in the Danish Family Study.
Of note, both cohorts include non-diabetic individuals with a
wide age span. Moreover, in vivo insulin secretion in absolute
terms was elevated in elderly individuals of the Danish Family
Study. However, we found no significant association between age
and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in human pancreatic
islets cultured in vitro. This suggests that b-cells in islets from
these elderly subjects are still able to respond to elevated glucose
with increased insulin secretion. However, eventually aging b-cells
may fail to adapt to the increasing demands for insulin production

 and T2D will develop. Interestingly, our functional experiments
suggest that several age-associated epigenetic modifications and
corresponding expression changes may compensate for the
increasing demands for insulin during aging. Indeed, epigenetic
changes in three out of four investigated genes in clonal b-cells
seem to have compensatory and protective roles in the human
islets. In support of this hypothesis, age-associated methylation
changes of KLF14 and ZNF518B in blood correlated with both
current and future insulin levels measured in vivo. In addition,
methylation of KLF14, FHL2 and GNPNAT1 was associated with
lower diabetes risk in the Botnia prospective study. Nevertheless,
this does not exclude an age-related b-cell defect in islets as
deficient insulin secretion in elderly individuals is not always
evident when analysed in absolute numbers, but rather when
analysed in relation to insulin resistance1. In line, aging was
associated with decreased DI in the Danish Family Study. In
addition, a recent study found that age-related epigenetic changes
in b-cells of old mice correlate with increased insulin secretion48.
We
and
others
have
previously
published
data
from
case–control studies, where we identified differential DNA
methylation of numerous genes in islets from subjects with
T2D versus controls3–7. However, in contrast to the present study
where we found increased methylation of 241 sites with aging,
diabetes was associated with decreased methylation of the
majority of the significant sites. Also there was only a minor
overlap between the genes identified in the present study and
previous islet case–control cohorts, suggesting that different
biological pathways underlie age- and diabetes-related DNA
methylation changes. It is also worth mentioning that many of the
hypomethylated sites identified in diabetic islets are located in
intergenic regions3, while a large part of hypermethylation
identified in aging islets take place in promoter regions. The
results in our different studies are in line with data presented in a
review by Jones et al.49, showing that methylation of CpG sites
that are located in CpG islands and promoter regions generally
increase with age while the methylation of intergenic CpG sites
often decrease with age.
It is possible that aging is associated with changes in islet-cell
composition and that this could affect our results50. However, we
used electron microscopy to analyse the cellular composition
of pancreatic islets and found no significant impact of age on b- or
a-cell content. Another confounding factor could be an age-related
increase in inflammatory cells in the islets, but comparison with a
publicly available data set on human pancreatic islets51 showed
that the expression of only 2 (JAG2 and IGFBP2) out of 51
inflammation-related genes expressed in islets were nominally
associated with age in our data set. This result supports that
inflammation is not a prominent feature in islets from elderly
subjects of our cohort. Also, a large number of the 241 identified
CpG sites remained significant if the analysis was limited to donors
with an age span of B20 years, making it unlikely that our
identified age-associated methylation changes are due to altered
islet-cell composition or inflammation. Also methylation data from
blood samples may be affected by changes in cellular composition
as aging has been found to associate with such changes31,32.
However, data from the study by Reinius et al.33 presented here,
together with a recent study by Yuan et al.52 that shows that most
of the age-associated epigenetic drift seen in blood is independent
of changes in blood cell composition, suggest that our methylation
results are not caused by changes in cell composition. These data
support that the age-associated epigenetic changes we identified in
human islets and blood are unlikely to be influenced by altered cell
composition.
Notably, the age-associated changes we observed in DNA
methylation in the human islets are of quite large magnitude
compared with data from some previous studies related to
metabolic disease4,5,53. For example, absolute differences in DNA
methylation larger than 20% between young and old donors were
found for many sites in the human islets. Also, the identified
differences in islet methylation between young and old donors
were comparable to previously published results in blood15,54.
Moreover, the impact of DNA methylation on future risk of
diabetes was of a similar magnitude to some of the top T2D SNPs
identified by GWAS55.
The interest in dissecting the impact of epigenetic variation on
human diseases has increased over the last decade. However, for
numerous diseases and epidemiological studies only blood is
available and it is not always possible to get access to the
pathogenic tissue of interest from humans56,57. Hence, it is
important to understand if epigenetic variation in human blood
cells
mirrors
epigenetic patterns in tissues
central
to the
pathogenesis of disease. Indeed, our study demonstrates the
value of blood for analysis of DNA methylation in relation to
disease since we were able to replicate our age-related epigenetic
findings from human islets in blood from large published
studies10,12,13,15 and our own cohorts. It would be interesting to
also replicate these findings in blood from the islet donors.
However, we do not have access to other tissues from the included
donors. Nevertheless, methylation data analysed in blood and
pancreas from the same donors in the study by Slieker et al.30
support our findings.
We conclude that age-related epigenetic alterations in blood
partially reflect DNA methylation changes in human pancreatic
islets and associate with increased insulin secretion in vivo, as well
as lower diabetes risk.
Methods
Human cohorts. Human pancreatic islets from 87 non-diabetic donors with a
broad range in age (26–74 years) and HbA1c o6.5%, as determined with the mono
S method, were obtained from the Nordic Network for Islet Transplantation at
Uppsala University, Sweden. This pancreatic islet cohort is collected by the
human tissue laboratory at Lund University Diabetes Centre and it is previously
described3,9,35. Characteristics of these donors are given in Table 1. Informed
consent for organ donation for medical research was obtained from pancreatic
donors or their relatives in accordance with the approval by the regional ethics
committees in Lund and Uppsala, Sweden.
Blood samples were obtained at two time points separated by B10 years
(baseline and follow-up) at the fasted state from 112 individuals with a broad range
in age (20–73 years at baseline and 32–83 years at follow-up), an HbA1c o6.5% at
follow-up and without known disease (Supplementary Data 9). These individuals are
part of a Danish Family Study previously described26,27, and includes 42 families
with genetic risk for T2D. Insulin and C-peptide levels were measured in blood
samples taken during fasting and a 75g 2 h OGTT at both baseline and follow-up.
DI was calculated as (100 � 0.144� insulin OGTTT30)/(glucose OGTTT30 � (glucose
OGTTT30–3.89))� (10,000/square root of: 6.72 � (glucose OGTTT0� insulin
OGTTT0� (glucose OGTTT0þ glucose OGTTT30 þ glucose OGTTT60 þ glucose
OGTTT90 þ glucose OGTTT120)/5� (insulin OGTTT0 þ insulin OGTTT30 þ insulin
OGTTT60 þ insulin OGTTT90 þ insulin OGTTT120)/5). Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants and the research protocol was approved by the
local Ethics Committee.
Blood samples were also obtained at baseline in the fasted state from 299
individuals of the Botnia prospective study34. This study includes individuals,
which were healthy at baseline and they were followed prospectively with repeated
OGTTs to detect progression to overt T2D. Here we included 105 participants who
converted to T2D (converters) and 194 non-converters (controls) who remained
healthy after 10.8±6.2 (mean±s.d.) years follow-up (Supplementary Data 10).
Sample processing of human islets. Human islets were prepared by collagenase
digestion and density gradient purification. Prior to nucleic acid purification, islets
were cultured for 4.1±0.2 days at 37� (5% CO2) in CMRL 1066 culture medium
(ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA, USA) supplemented with 10mM HEPES, 2 mM
L-glutamine, 0.1mM gentamicin, 0.27 mM amphotericin B (Fungizone, Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, USA), 20 mg ml� 1 Ciprofloxacin (Bayer HealthCare, Leverku-
sen, Germany) and 10mM nicotinamide58. The purity of the islet preparations was
69.1±18.4% (mean±s.d.), as determined by dithizone staining58. There was no
significant impact of age on purity of the islet preparations (Supplementary Fig. 10).
Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (stimulation index) from the human islets was
measured in response to 1.67 and 16.7 mM glucose during glucose perfusion. Insulin
content in the effluent collected in 6-min intervals was measured by enzyme immune

 assay specific for human insulin (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). The stimulation
index is calculated as the ratio between the area under the curve calculated for high
glucose, divided by the area under the curve calculated for low glucose59. DNA and
RNA were extracted from human pancreatic islets using the AllPrep DNA/RNA kit
(Qiagen, Hilding, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nucleic
acid purity and concentration were determined using a nanodrop (NanoDrop
Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). All DNA samples had an A260/280 ratio of
1.8–2.1, whereas the 260/280 ratios for RNA were 1.9–2.2. The integrity and quality
of the RNA were assessed using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA) and RNA integrity number (RIN) values were between 8.6 and 10. Islet
a- and b-cell contents were determined in electron micrographs3 in islets from 12
donors aged 32–68 years. Hand-picked islets where fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in
freshly prepared Millonig and post fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide before being
dehydrated and embedded in AGAR 100 (Oxford Instruments Nordiska, Lidingo
¨,
Sweden) and cut into ultrathin sections. The sections were put on Cu-grids and
contrasted using uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The islet containing sections were
examined in a JEM 1230 electron microscope (JEOL-USA. Inc., MA). Micrographs
were analysed for b-cell content with ImageJ and in-house software programmed in
Matlab. a- and b-cells were distinguished by means of granular appearance. The
insulin granules of b-cells have a dense core surrounded by a white hale while a-cells
have small dense granules.
Global DNA methylation analysis. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of
human pancreatic islets was performed with the Infinium HumanMethylation450
BeadChip kit (Illumina, Inc., CA, USA). Genomic DNA (500 ng) was bisulfite
converted using an EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA)
and then used to analyse DNA methylation with Infinium assay using the standard
Infinium HD Assay Methylation Protocol Guide (part number 15019519, Illu-
mina). Samples were randomly bisulfite treated and distributed on the arrays.
The bead chips were imaged with the Illumina iScan. The Infinium Human-
Methylation450 BeadChip contains 485,577 probes and covers 99% of all RefSeq
genes with the capacity for 12 samples per chip22. The GenomeStudio methylation
module software was used to calculate the raw methylation score for each DNA
methylation site, which is represented as methylation b value. The b values are
calculated as b ¼ intensity of the methylated allele (M)/(intensity of the
unmethylated allele (U) þ intensity of the methylated allele (M) þ 100). All samples
passed GenomeStudio quality control steps based on built-in control probes for
staining, hybridization, extension and specificity and displayed high quality
bisulfite conversion efficiency with an intensity signal above 4,000 (ref. 60). Probes
were then filtered based on detection P value, and probes with a mean detection
P value 40.01, as determined by the Illumina platform, were removed from further
analysis. In total, DNA methylation data were obtained for 483,031 probes. Since
the cohort included islets from both males and females, Y-chromosome data were
removed and subsequently DNA methylation data from 482,954 probes remained
for further analysis. b values were converted to M values for further analysis
(M ¼ log2(b/(1 � b)) (ref. 61). Background correction and quantile normalization
were performed using the lumi package from bioconductor62. To identify DNA
methylation changes that associate with age, the methylation data were analysed
using a linear regression model with the limma package in Bioconductor63,64
including bisulfite treatment, sex, BMI, purity of the islets, days in culture and
HbA1c as covariates. A FDR analysis was performed to correct for multiple testing
and q valueso0.05 were considered significant. Since b values are easier to
interpret biologically, M values were reconverted into b values and were then used
when describing the data and when generating figures. Moreover, since some
probes on Illumina’s DNA methylation chip may cross-react to multiple locations
in the genome, we used the published data by Chen et al.65 to evaluate the number
of possible cross-reactive probes among our significant methylation data.
Pyrosequencing. Pyrosequencing was used to analyse DNA methylation in whole
blood from 112 individuals in the Danish Family Study. Selected and surrounding
CpG sites in six genes were analysed; cg06639320, cg22454769 and cg24079702 in
FHL2, cg08097417 and cg22285878 in KLF14, cg23606718 in FAM123C,
cg16295725 and cg23995914 in ZNF518B, cg16764848 in GNPNAT1, and
cg05555455 and cg18549036 in HLTF. Assays (Supplementary Data 13) were
designed with the PyroMark Assay Design 2.0 software (Qiagen). Pyrosequencing
was performed with the PyroMark Q96 ID system (Qiagen) and all procedures
were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. In short,
genomic DNA from whole blood was isolated with the QIAmpDNA Blood
Mini Kit (Qiagen). 400 ng of the DNA were bisulfite converted with the
EpiTect 96 Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, all samples from the Danish Family Study) or the
EZ DNA methylation kit (islet samples for technical validation and biological
replication, and samples from the Botnia prospective study) and 10 ng of the
bisulfite-converted DNA were used as input for each PCR reaction. The PyroMark
PCR Master Mix kit (Qiagen), streptavidin-coated beads (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden), PyroMark Gold Q96 reagents (Qiagen), PyroMark Q96 Vacuum
Workstation and PyroMark Q96 software (version 2.5.8, Qiagen) were used
for the determination and analysis of DNA methylation, all according to the
manufacturers’ recommendations.
mRNA expression analysis. mRNA expression was analysed with the Affymetrix
GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST whole transcript based array (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. We computed
robust multichip average expression measure using the oligo package from
Bioconductor66.
Transcription factor-binding site analysis. LASAGNA-Search 2.0 (ref. 67) was
used to analyse which transcription factor-binding sites overlapped with the
significant CpG sites in the promoters for FHL2 and HLTF. Sequences of DNA
stretching from 5 bp upstream of the first CpG site to 5 bp downstream of the last
CpG site were entered into the search tool. TRANSFAC matrices and aligned
models were used and the significance cut-off was set to the default value.
Luciferase assays. The protocol has been described in detail elsewhere6. Briefly, a
2,000bp fragment of the ZNF518B and GNPNAT1 promoters immediately upstream
of the transcription start site, covering CpG sites with age-associated changes in
methylation was cloned into a CpG-free luciferase reporter vector (pCpGL-basic)
kindly provided by Dr Klug and Dr Rehli68. Cloning of sequences and insertion into
the pCpGL-basic vector was performed by GenScript (GenScript USA Inc.,
Piscataway, NJ, USA). Two different DNA methyltransferases, SssI and HhaI (2.5 U
per mg DNA) (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany), were then used to
methylate the constructs. SssI methylates all cytosine residues within the double-
stranded dinucleotide recognition sequence CG and HhaI methylates only the
internal cytosine residue in GCGC sequences. The clonal rat b-cell line 832/13 INS-1
(ref. 69), a kind gift from Dr Christopher Newgard at Duke University, was
co-transfected with 25ng methylated or mock-methylated pCpGL-vector including
either of the two promoter inserts together with 4 ng of pRL renilla luciferase control
reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly and renilla luciferase
luminescence, as a value of transcriptional activity, was measured for each construct
with the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and an Infinite M200 PRO
multiplate reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Ma
¨nnedorf, Switzerland). Cells transfected
with an empty pCpGL-vector were used as a background control for firefly luciferase
results, and untransfected cells were used as a background for renilla results.
Cell culture and siRNA-mediated knockdown. For transfection, 2.0 � 105 832/13
INS-1 b-cells per well were seeded on 24-well plates and cultured overnight. Cells
were then transfected with 25 nM siRNA (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) by using
Dharmafect I (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The siRNAs used were s133583 (siFhl2), s176980 (siGnpnat1), s149330 (siHltf),
s176846 (siZfp518b) and a negative control siRNA (50-GAGACCCUAUCCGUG
AUUAUU-30). RNA was isolated with the GeneJET RNA purification kit (Thermo
Scientific) 72 h post transfection and converted to complementary DNA (cDNA)
with the RevertAid First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific). Knock-
down was verified on a ViiA7 qPCR system (Life Technologies) with TaqMan
assays (Life Technologies) for Fhl2 (Rn00581565_m1), Gnpnat1 (Rn01414655_m1)
and Hltf (Rn01493406_m1). Assays for Hprt1 (Rn01527840_m1) and Ppia
(Rn00690933_m1) were used as endogenous controls. Expression of Zfp518b was
analysed with SybrGreen (Thermo Scientific) and the following primers; 50-CG
TCCGGGCCTGTTGG-30 and 50-AGGCCCAGAAGTCAAGTGTG-30 and
normalized to the expression of Hprt1 (50-CCCAGCGTCGTGATTAGTGA-30 and
50-TGGCCTCCCATCTCCTTCAT-30) and Ppia (50-AGGATTCATGTGCCA
GGGTG-30 and 50-CTCAGTCTTGGCAGTGCAGA-30). Quantification was done
with the DDCt method.
Insulin secretion in clonal b-cells. Insulin secretion was determined in 1 h static
incubations 72 h post transfection. Transfected b-cells were washed in HEPES
balanced salt solution (HBSS; 114 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4,
1.16 mM MgSO4, 20 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 25.5 mM NaHCO3, 0.2% bovine
serum albumin, pH 7.2) supplemented with 2.8 mM glucose, followed by a 2 h pre-
incubation at 37 �C in the same buffer. Insulin secretion was then determined by
stimulating the cells with fresh HBSS with 2.8 or 16.7 mM glucose for 1 h. Insulin
released into the buffer was measured with a rat insulin ELISA (Mercodia) and
normalized to the total amount of protein in each well as measured with the BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific).
Statistics. The association between age and methylation in pancreatic islets was
analysed with a linear regression model using methylation M values with the limma
package in bioconductor63,64. Sex BMI, HbA1c, bisulfite treatment, days in culture
and islet purity were included as covariates in the analysis. FDR analysis was
performed to correct for multiple testing70. Linear regression models were used to
test associations between age and HbA1c, BMI or glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion including the same covariates as above except for days in culture, islet
purity, HbA1c or BMI when appropriate. Correlation between age and islet-cell
composition was analysed with Spearman correlation. The genomic distribution of
significant sites was analysed with a w2-test. Associations between age and DNA
methylation measured by pyrosequencing were analysed with linear mixed effects
models for the Danish Family Study. Here age, sex, BMI and HbA1c were included
as fixed factors, whereas family number/pedigree was included as a random factor

 in all models. Incident T2D was analysed with a Cox regression model. Data were
treated as left truncated and right censored. The covariate measurements were
made at entry time. All regression analyses were performed with a robust variance
estimate to adjust for within-family dependence. Correlation between b values of
DNA methylation and gene expression was analysed with Spearman’s rank test.
Functional studies were analysed with Mann–Whitney test or Wilcoxon
signed rank test as indicated. Statistical analyses were performed with R
(http://www.r-project.org/) and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
