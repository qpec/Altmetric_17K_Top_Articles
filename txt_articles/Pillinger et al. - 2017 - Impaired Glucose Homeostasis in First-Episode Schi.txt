IMPORTANCE Schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However,
it is not clear whether schizophrenia confers an inherent risk for glucose dysregulation in the
absence of the effects of chronic illness and long-term treatment.
OBJECTIVE To conduct a meta-analysis examining whether individuals with first-episode
schizophrenia already exhibit alterations in glucose homeostasis compared with controls.
DATA SOURCES The EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases were systematically
searched for studies examining measures of glucose homeostasis in antipsychotic-naive
individuals with first-episode schizophrenia compared with individuals serving as controls.
STUDY SELECTION Case-control studies reporting on fasting plasma glucose levels, plasma
glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test, fasting plasma insulin levels, insulin
resistance, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in first-episode antipsychotic-naive individuals
with first-episode schizophrenia compared with healthy individuals serving as controls. Two
independent investigators selected the studies.
DATA EXTRACTION Two independent investigators extracted study-level data for a
random-effects meta-analysis. Standardized mean differences in fasting plasma glucose
levels, plasma glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test, fasting plasma insulin levels,
insulin resistance, and HbA1c levels were calculated. Sensitivity analyses examining the effect
of body mass index, diet and exercise, race/ethnicity, and minimal (�2 weeks) antipsychotic
exposure were performed.
DATA SYNTHESIS Of 3660 citations retrieved, 16 case-control studies comprising 15 samples
met inclusion criteria. The overall sample included 731 patients and 614 controls. Fasting
plasma glucose levels (Hedges g = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.38; P = .03), plasma glucose levels
after an oral glucose tolerance test (Hedges g = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.05; P = .007), fasting
plasma insulin levels (Hedges g = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.72; P = .01), and insulin resistance
(homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) (Hedges g = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.55;
P = .001) were all significantly elevated in patients compared with controls. However, HbA1c
levels (Hedges g = −0.08; CI, −0.34 to 0.18; P = .55) were not altered in patients compared
with controls.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings show that glucose homeostasis is altered from
illness onset in schizophrenia, indicating that patients are at increased risk of diabetes as a
result. This finding has implications for the monitoring and treatment choice for patients
with schizophrenia.

L
arge-scale epidemiologic studies have established that
people with schizophrenia die 15 to 30 years earlier than
the general population and that 60% or more of this pre-
mature mortality is due to causes not related to the central ner-
vous system,1-5 predominantly cardiovascular.6 Rates of type
2 diabetes are estimated to be 2 to 3 times higher in schizo-
phrenia than in the general population, with a prevalence of
10% to 15%.7,8 Although antipsychotic use may contribute to
thisassociation,alinkbetweenschizophreniaanddiabeteswas
already observed in the 19th century, long before the intro-
duction of antipsychotics and in an era when diets did not have
such a propensity to induce metabolic derangements.9,10 For
over a decade, there has been a drive to identify whether
schizophrenia confers an inherent risk for the development of
type 2 diabetes by investigating patients at illness onset be-
fore the potentially confounding effects of chronic illness and
long-term antipsychotic treatment. Several studies have fo-
cused on the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes in patient
cohorts compared with controls. The results from meta-
analyses of these studies examining the prevalence of type 2
diabetes in individuals with first-episode psychosis and con-
trols have found no significant differences between the 2
groups.11,12 However, there are 2 limitations with restricting
analysestoanestablisheddiagnosisoftype2diabetes.Thefirst
limitation is that patients may be less likely to seek medical
attention, so there is the risk of underreporting. The second
isthatthedevelopmentoftype2diabetestakestime,withpeak
onset in middle age, and so may not have had time to develop
in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Type 2 diabetes
shows a progression through a period of insulin resistance, el-
evated insulin levels, and impaired glucose tolerance (predia-
betes)beforethedevelopmentofsymptomsandapatienteven-
tually receiving a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. If a study’
s
outcome is whether criteria are met for a diagnosis of type 2
diabetes, significant alterations in glucose homeostasis be-
tween patient and control groups may be missed. In view of
theselimitations,weperformedameta-analysisofstudiesthat
focused on measures of glucose control in individuals either
at risk for psychosis or in their first episode of psychosis. The
aim of our meta-analysis was to test the hypothesis that indi-
viduals with first-episode schizophrenia exhibit alterations in
glucose homeostasis compared with matched controls.
Methods
Selection Procedures
A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-analyses)13 and MOOSE (Meta-analysis of Observa-
tional Studies in Epidemiology)14 guidelines (eTables 1 and 2
in the Supplement). Two of us (T.P. and K.B.) independently
searched MEDLINE (from 1946 to week 2 of April 2016),
EMBASE (from 1947 to April 25, 2016), and PsycINFO (from
1806 to week 2 of April 2016). The following key words were
used: (schizophrenia or schizoaffective or psychosis or psy-
chotic) and (early onset or first episode or at risk or ultra high
risk or prodrome) and (medication or drug or antipsychotic) and
(glucose or diabetes or type 2 or prediabetes or intolerance or oral
glucose tolerance test or OGTT) or fasting or random or insulin
or insulin resistance or hemoglobin [Hb] A1c or homeosta* or ho-
meostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]).
Studies in any language were considered, although all the in-
cluded articles were published in English. The search was
complemented by hand-searching of meta-analyses and re-
view articles. Abstracts were screened and the full texts of rel-
evant studies were retrieved. If full texts or abstracts were not
available, authors were contacted and articles requested. Two
of us (T.P. and K.B.) selected the final studies for review and
meta-analysis.
Selection Criteria
Inclusioncriteriawere(1)aDSMorInternationalStatisticalClas-

(HOMA). The OGTT was required to meet the American Dia-
betes Association (ADA)18 and World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria,19 namely, serum glucose concentration mea-
sured 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load following an over-
night fast. Fasting serum glucose and insulin concentrations
were defined as concentrations of either measure taken after
an overnight fast in accordance with the ADA and WHO crite-
ria. HOMA measurements of insulin resistance were required
to follow either the original HOMA-IR formula20 (fasting
plasma insulin (mU/L) × fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)/
22.5) or the updated HOMA2 formula21 via the University of
Oxford Diabetic Trials Unit HOMA2 calculator, version 2.2 (http:
//www.dtu.ox.ac.uk).
Key Points
Question Do individuals with first-episode schizophrenia already
demonstrate evidence of glucose dysregulation?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 14 case-control studies
comprising 1345 participants, individuals with first-episode
schizophrenia had elevated fasting plasma glucose levels, elevated
plasma glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test, and
elevated fasting plasma insulin levels, as well as greater insulin
resistance compared with healthy individuals serving as controls.
Meanings Glucose homeostasis is altered from illness onset in
schizophrenia, indicating that patients are at increased risk for
type 2 diabetes as a result; this finding has implications for the
monitoring and treatment of patients with schizophrenia.

Exclusion criteria were (1) studies only assessing diagno-
sis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, (2) patients with multiple epi-
sodesofschizophrenia,(3)chronicantipsychotictreatment(>2
weeks’lifetime exposure), (4) substance- or medication-
induced psychotic disorder, (5) physical comorbidity that may
affectglucosehomeostasis(eg,priordiagnosesoftype1ortype
2 diabetes, other endocrine disorders [eg, Cushing syndrome
or acromegaly], pancreatitis, congenital disorders known to in-
crease risk of type 2 diabetes [eg, Klinefelter or Turner syn-
drome], and other systemic illnesses that may affect pancre-
atic function [eg, cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis, or any
chronic systemic inflammatory illness]), and (6) absence of
measures in a healthy control group.
A small proportion of articles included patients with a lim-
iteddurationofantipsychoticuse(2weeksmaximum).Inthese
cases, authors were contacted to obtain access to data con-
cerning patients who were drug naive. If these data were not
available, sensitivity analyses were performed examining only
studies of patients who had no antipsychotic exposure.
WHO identifies obesity as the strongest risk factor for type
2 diabetes from evidence based on studies across 188
countries.22 In view of this observation, sensitivity analyses
were performed examining studies in which patients and con-
trols were matched on body mass index (BMI) to determine
whether failure to match BMI influenced results. The match-
ingwasconfirmedbyeitherreviewofstudymethodsorbycon-
firmation of no significant difference between mean BMI
levels of the patient and control groups (a 2-tailed P value <.05
was deemed significant). WHO recognizes several other risk
factors for type 2 diabetes relating to BMI, including un-
healthy diet and physical inactivity.22 Individuals with schizo-
phrenia engage in significantly less physical exercise than con-
trols, with even lower levels of physical activity observed in
early stages of the illness.23 In addition, the prodrome is as-
sociated with decreased physical activity and poor eating
habits.24,25 To address whether differences in diet and exer-
cise between patient and control groups influenced the re-
sults, sensitivity analyses examining groups matched for diet
and exercise were performed. Diet and exercise matching was
confirmed either by review of study methods or by confirma-
tion of no significant difference between mean diet and exer-
cise parameters of the patient and control groups (a 2-tailed
P value <.05 was deemed significant). Nonmodifiable risk fac-
torsfortype2diabetes,suchasethnicity,arealsorecognized,22
and in this context, sensitivity analyses were also performed
examining studies in which participants were matched for eth-
nic background.
Recorded Variables
For every study, data were extracted according to the follow-
ing model: author, year of publication, country, design (ie, pro-
spective, cross-sectional, case-control, and retrospective),
matching criteria for patients and controls (confirmed by re-
view of study methods or by confirmation of nonsignificance
between mean parameter levels of patient and control groups;
a 2-tailed P value <.05 was deemed significant), whether or not
patient groups were antipsychotic naive (and if not, duration
of treatment), and mean (SD) measure of glucose homeostasis
in patient and control groups. If there were multiple publica-
tions for the same data set, data were extracted from the study
with the largest data set. The Table demonstrates this data ex-
traction with the exception of raw glucose homeostasis mea-
surements (mean and SDs), which are documented in eTables
3-7 in the Supplement. The parameters of glucose homeosta-
sis available in the studies described in the Table but not in-
cluded in meta-analysis, along with the rationale behind ex-
clusion, are documented in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
A 2-tailed P < .05 was deemed significant. A random-effects
model was used in all analyses owing to an expectation of
heterogeneity of data across studies. Standardized mean dif-
ferences in glucose homeostasis measurements between pa-
tient and control cohorts were used as the effect size, deter-
mined using Hedges adjusted g. The 95% CI of the effect size
was also calculated. The direction of the effect size was posi-
tiveifindividualswithschizophreniademonstratedhigherval-
uesofglucosehomeostaticmeasurementscomparedwithcon-
trols. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the
Cochran Q statistic.42 Inconsistency across studies was as-
sessed with the I2 statistic,43 with an I2 value of less than 25%
deemed to have low heterogeneity; 25% to 75%, medium
heterogeneity; and greater than 75%, high heterogeneity. Pub-
lication bias and selective reporting were assessed using the
Egger test of the intercept44 (although this factor was not cal-
culated when <10 studies were analyzed as recommended by
the Cochrane Collaboration45) and represented diagrammati-
cally with funnel plots, again as recommended by the Coch-
rane Collaboration45 (eFigures 1-5 in the Supplement). CMA,
version 3.0 (Comprehensive Meta-analysis Software) was used
in all analyses.
Results
Retrieved Studies
After exclusion of studies reporting on overlapping data sets,
16 case-control studies26-41 comprising 15 samples met inclu-
sion criteria and were analyzed. The search process is dem-
onstrated in Figure 1, and the final studies selected are sum-
marized in the Table. The overall sample included 731 patients
and 614 controls.
Fasting Plasma Glucose Concentration
Fasting plasma glucose concentration in patients and con-
trols was analyzed using data from 14 studies comprising 718
patients and 599 controls.26-39 Fasting plasma glucose con-
centration was significantly elevated in patients compared
with controls (Hedges g = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.38; P = .03)
(Figure 2). There was significant between-sample hetero-
geneity, with an I2 value of 58.29% (Cochran Q = 31.17;
P = .003). Findings of the Egger test (P = .07) suggested that
publication bias was not significant. Restricting the analyses
to antipsychotic-naive patients by excluding the 3 studies
that included patients with up to 2 weeks of antipsychotic
treatment37-39 demonstrated that fasting plasma glucose con-

ings of the Egger test (P = .12) suggested that publication bias
was not significant. Excluding the 3 studies that included
patients with up to 2 weeks of antipsychotic treatment37-39 to
restrict the analyses to antipsychotic-naive patients demon-
strated that fasting plasma insulin concentration remained sig-
nificantly elevated in patients compared with controls (Hedges
g = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.03-0.91; P = .04). Exclusion of 1 study that
examined non–BMI-matched patients and controls34 demon-
strated that fasting plasma insulin concentration remained sig-
nificantly elevated in patients compared with controls (Hedges
g = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.04-0.72; P = .03). A sensitivity analysis ex-
amining studies in which patients and controls were matched
for ethnicity26,31,34,37,46 demonstrated that fasting insulin con-
centration remained significantly elevated in patients com-
pared with controls (Hedges g = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30-0.68;
P < .001). In the context of low study numbers, a sensitivity
analysis to assess the impact of diet and exercise was not
performed.
Insulin Resistance
Insulin resistance as measured using the HOMA-IR tool in
patients and controls was analyzed using data from 10
studies26,28-32,34,38,39,41 comprising 485 patients and 400 con-
trols. HOMA-IR was significantly raised in patients compared
with controls (Hedges g = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.14-0.55; P = .001)
(Figure 3). Between-sample heterogeneity was moderate but
significant, with an I2 value of 55.40% (Cochran Q = 20.18;
P = .02). Findings of the Egger test (P = .10) suggested that
publication bias was not significant. Excluding the 2 studies
that included patients with up to 2 weeks of antipsychotic
treatment38,41 to restrict the analyses to antipsychotic-naive
patients demonstrated that HOMA-IR remained significantly
elevated in patients compared with controls (Hedges g = 0.44;
95% CI, 0.23-0.65; P < .001). Exclusion of 1 study that exam-
ined non–BMI-matched patients and controls34 demonstrated
that HOMA-IR remained significantly elevated in patients
compared with controls (Hedges g = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.09-0.53;
P = .005). A sensitivity analysis examining studies in which
patients and controls were matched for ethnicity26,31,34,39
demonstrated that HOMA-IR remained significantly elevated
in patients compared with controls (Hedges g = 0.66; 95% CI,
0.43-0.88; P < .001). In the context of low study numbers, a
sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of diet and exercise
was not performed.
HbA1c Analysis
The HbA1c levels were analyzed using data from 4
studies27,34,38,41 comprising 166 patients and 164 controls.
The HbA1c levels were not altered in patients compared with
controls (Hedges g = −0.08; 95% CI, −0.34 to 0.18; P = .55)
(eFigure 7 in the Supplement). Between-sample heteroge-
neity was moderate as indicated by an I2 value of 31.50%,
but a Cochran Q value of 4.38 (P = .22) suggested nonsignifi-
cant heterogeneity. Of these 4 studies, 2 studies examined
patients with up to 2 weeks of antipsychotic use,38,41 and 1
study examined non–BMI-matched patients and controls.34
In the context of low study numbers, sensitivity analyses
were not performed.
Discussion
Our main findings are that patients with schizophrenia show
raised fasting plasma glucose levels, reduced glucose toler-
ance, raised fasting plasma insulin levels, and increased insu-
lin resistance at illness onset. With the exception of fasting glu-
coselevels,thesealterationswerealsoseenwhenanalyseswere
restricted to antipsychotic-naive and BMI-matched samples.
When analysis was restricted to diet and exercise–matched
samples, significance was maintained for raised fasting glu-
cose levels in patients. All results remained significant when
analyses were restricted to samples matched for race/
ethnicity. No significant differences were demonstrated in
HbA1c levels, although this result should be interpreted with
caution owing to the small sample size used in this analysis.
The results of our meta-analysis extend recent studies show-
ing high rates of diabetes in patients with chronic schizophre-
nia by demonstrating that altered glucose homeostasis is pres-
ent from illness onset.
Strengths and Limitations
By focusing our analysis on patients with first-episode schizo-
phrenia, an attempt was made to limit the duration of second-
ary illness-related factors known to affect glucose homeosta-
sis.However,individualsintheprodromalstateandthosewith

first-episode schizophrenia already have poorer dietary
habits, decreased physical activity, and an increased likeli-
hood of smoking compared with age-matched controls.23-25,47
Our search did not find any studies that examined glucose ho-
meostasis in individuals at risk for developing psychosis that
matched our inclusion criteria, and the duration of untreated
psychosis was documented in only 5 of the 16 studies
analyzed.27,28,32,36,38 Since our definition of first-episode
schizophrenia was broad, ranging from first clinical contact to
duration of illness up to 5 years following illness onset,17 quan-
tification of the duration of poor lifestyle habits for the over-
all sample was not possible, and the small number of studies
that specifically documented duration of untreated illness pre-
vented a meta-regression from examining the influence of
chronicity of illness on glucose homeostasis. Although a sen-
sitivity analysis examining studies in which participants were
matched for diet and exercise remained significant for raised
fasting glucose levels in the patient cohort, there was no sig-
nificant elevation in the BMI-matched sensitivity analysis.
However, the sensitivity analyses of fasting insulin levels and
insulin resistance showed significant dysregulation for these
variablesinthepatientcohortthatwasmatchedbyBMItocon-
trols. Thus, although it is a limitation that we were not able to
examine their potential influences in all instances, when we
were able to examine them, differences in BMI, diet, and ex-
ercise did not account for our findings with the exception of
BMI for fasting glucose levels.
Although all participants used in the meta-analysis were
described as physically healthy with no illnesses that would
affect glucose homeostasis, only 8 studies defined use of over-
the-counter and prescription medication as a specific exclu-
sion criterion,28-31,34,36,37,41 and only 4 studies defined psy-
chotropic use other than antipsychotics as an exclusion
criterion29,30,32,33 (full details in eTable 8 in the Supplement).
Thus, the potential use of medication other than antipsychot-
ics that might disturb glucose homeostasis is a possible con-
foundingfactorinourmeta-analysis.Wealsoacknowledgethat
4 of the 16 studies used in this meta-analysis analyzed pa-
tients with schizophrenia as well as individuals with schizo-
phreniform disorder, brief psychotic disorder, and psychosis
not otherwise specified,27,37,38,41 which may contribute to
heterogeneity in the sample. There was also variability in
matching criteria for patients and controls, which might be sig-
nificant given the effect of demographic variables on risk for
type2diabetes.22Nevertheless,8studiesdocumentedthatpar-
ticipantswerematchedforrace/ethnicity,26,31,34,36-39,41andour
sensitivity analyses suggest that differences in ethnicities be-
tween groups were not responsible for the overarching find-
ings of the meta-analysis. Two studies failed to match for
sex,28,33 1 study failed to match for age,30 and only 8 studies
documented that participants were matched for smoking
status26-28,31,33,34,39,41 (Table and eTable 8 in the Supple-
ment). Other limitations of our analyses include between-
sample heterogeneity in glucose homeostasis parameters

tested, including the use of either the original HOMA-IR
equation20 or the HOMA2 equation.21 Nevertheless, the ran-
dom-effectsmodelthatweusedisrobusttoheterogeneity,and
the fact that findings were consistent across different meth-
ods suggests that they are robust to technical variation.
In view of the findings of our meta-analysis, prospective
studies investigating the effect of lifestyle factors on the glu-
cose dysregulation seen in patients with first-episode schizo-
phrenia would help to determine the degree to which altera-
tions are intrinsic to schizophrenia or the consequences of
emerging symptoms. Longitudinal studies examining the ef-
ficacy of early interventions targeting a reduction in diabetic
risk (both lifestyle based and pharmacologic) in individuals
with schizophrenia who exhibit subtle early aberrances in glu-
cose homeostasis would be useful.
Although the findings of this meta-analysis may in part re-
flect poorer lifestyle habits in patients compared with con-
trols, other mechanisms may also contribute to the link be-
tween schizophrenia and altered glucose regulation. Both
schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes are associated with early de-
velopmental risk factors, such as low birth weight, preterm
birth, gestational diabetes, and maternal malnutrition or obe-
sity. The increased risk of impaired glucose homeostasis and
schizophrenia in the context of early developmental insults is
demonstrated by studies examining survivors from the 1944-
1945 Dutch famine and the 1959-1961 Chinese famine. These
studies demonstrate a relative risk of approximately 2 for
developing schizophrenia in individuals conceived or in early
gestation during a period of famine,48-50 as well as an
increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance later in life.51
Stress and hypercortisolemia may also contribute to this asso-
ciation between the 2 conditions, with antipsychotic-naive
individuals with first-episode psychosis exhibiting higher
baseline cortisol levels and blunted cortisol wakening
response compared with controls.52 There is also evidence for
a shared genetic vulnerability. Relatives of individuals with
schizophrenia experience higher rates of type 2 diabetes,53-55
and genome-wide association studies have revealed shared
susceptibility genes between schizophrenia and type 2
diabetes.56,57 Evidence to support the existence of pleiotropy
between these genes has been demonstrated by a network
analysis examining common signaling pathways involved in
both schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes, with identification
of proteins that play a role in calcium signaling, adipocyto-
kine signaling, Akt signaling, and γ-secretase–mediated
ErbB4 signaling.57 Thus, dysfunction in common signaling
pathways may drive central neurologic dysfunction as well
as peripheral metabolic dysfunction.

Conclusions
Regardless of the mechanism, this meta-analysis has demon-
strated an association between schizophrenia and early de-
rangements in glucose homeostasis. The OGTT is a more sen-
sitive measure of abnormalities in glucose metabolism than
fasting plasma glucose level58,59 and is recognized by WHO as
the only means of identifying individuals with impaired glu-
cose tolerance. The use of fasting plasma glucose measure-
ment alone as a screen for type 2 diabetes results in approxi-
mately 30% of type 2 diabetes cases being missed.60 Indeed,
the OGTT has been recommended for screening and monitor-
ing of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders owing
to its increased sensitivity.61 This sensitivity lends further sig-
nificance to the large effect size for raised glucose concentra-
tions after OGTT seen in patients with schizophrenia com-
paredwithcontrols.Althoughpredominantlyusedinresearch,
HOMA-IR is well validated as a surrogate marker of insulin re-
sistance, with its results correlating well with standard tests of
insulin resistance, such as the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
clamp.62 Therefore, the results from this analysis have major
clinical implications. They indicate that individuals with
schizophrenia present at the onset of illness with an already
vulnerable phenotype for the development of type 2 diabe-
tes. Given that several antipsychotic drugs may worsen glu-
cose regulation,63,64 there is thus a responsibility placed on the
treating clinician to select an appropriate antipsychotic at an
appropriate dose so as to limit the metabolic impact of treat-
ment.Furthermore,theassociationbetweenschizophreniaand
glucose dysregulation suggests that patients should be edu-
cated regarding diet and physical exercise, as well as diabetic
screening, and offered early lifestyle and pharmacologic inter-
ventions to combat the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes.
