Context: The increased use of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that involve radiation raises
concerns about radiation effects, particularly in children and the radiosensitive thyroid gland.
Objectives: Evaluation of relative risk (RR) trends for thyroid radiation doses ,0.2 gray (Gy); evi-
dence of a threshold dose; and possible modifiers of the dose-response, e.g., sex, age at exposure,
time since exposure.
Design and Setting: Pooled data from nine cohort studies of childhood external radiation exposure
and thyroid cancer with individualized dose estimates, $1000 irradiated subjects or $10 thyroid
cancer cases, with data limited to individuals receiving doses ,0.2 Gy.
Participants: Cohorts included the following: childhood cancer survivors (n = 2); children treated for
benign diseases (n = 6); and children who survived the atomic bombings in Japan (n = 1). There were
252 cases and 2,588,559 person-years in irradiated individuals and 142 cases and 1,865,957 person-
years in nonirradiated individuals.
Intervention: There were no interventions.
Main Outcome Measure: Incident thyroid cancers.
Results: For both ,0.2 and ,0.1 Gy, RRs increased with thyroid dose (P , 0.01), without significant
departure from linearity (P = 0.77 and P = 0.66, respectively). Estimates of threshold dose ranged
from 0.0 to 0.03 Gy, with an upper 95% confidence bound of 0.04 Gy. The increasing dose–response
trend persisted .45 years after exposure, was greater at younger age at exposure and younger
attained age, and was similar by sex and number of treatments.

 Conclusions: Our analyses reaffirmed linearity of the dose response as the most plausible re-
lationship for “as low as reasonably achievable” assessments for pediatric low-dose radiation-
associated thyroid cancer risk. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 2575–2583, 2017)
T
he increasing use of diagnostic and therapeutic
medical procedures that involve radiation raises
concerns about the consequences of low-dose irradiation
on cancer occurrence and in particular whether linear-
based extrapolations represent the best estimate of low-
dose cancer risk or whether a threshold dose, below
which there is no risk of radiation-induced cancer,
might exist (1–3) (see http://dels.nas.edu/Upcoming-Event/
Planning-Towards-BEIR-VIII-Report/AUTO-0-14-84-B).
With increased radiation exposures of children and the
well-documented radiosensitivity of the thyroid gland,
data on thyroid cancer incidence among low-dose
thyroid-irradiated children provide an opportunity to
address issues of pediatric radiation-associated thyroid
cancer risk in relation to assessments of as low as rea-
sonably achievable (ALARA), with implications for both
clinical practice and radioepidemiology (3–7). With these
considerations in mind, we pool epidemiologic studies on
children exposed to external radiation and analyze thy-
roid cancer incidence for those exposed at low doses.
A recent pooling of 12 epidemiologic studies of thy-
roid cancer following radiation exposure in childhood
included a broad range of thyroid radiation doses,
from ,0.1 gray (Gy) for treatment of benign diseases
and exposures following the atomic bombings in Japan
to .60 Gy resulting from radiation therapies for various
childhood cancers (8). Analyses revealed a curvilinear re-
lationship, with relative risks (RR) increasing supralinearly
through about 2 to 4 Gy, leveling at doses between 10 and
30 Gy with RRs of 30 to 40 and declining thereafter, with
RRs remaining 5 to 10 at 50 to 60 Gy. The leveling and
downturn at higher doses may have reflected cell-killing
effects, although compensatory accelerated stem cell
repopulation may have partially mitigated the decline (9).
The pooled analysis reported increased RRs for doses ,0.1
Gy, but did not fully explore the result (8). Investigators also
identified important modifiers of the dose–response asso-
ciation, namely, radiation dose–response trends emerged
within 5 to 10 years of exposure, increased at younger ages
at exposure, declined with increasing attained age, and
persisted for 50 years and more after exposure (8, 10).
Trends were comparable in strength for females and males.
Notably, these analyses did not address whether patterns of
effect modification derived exclusively from those exposed
at moderate and high doses or whether there were similar
patterns among those exposed only at lower doses.
Questions about thyroid cancer risks at low thyroid
radiation doses in children are best addressed using data in
children exposed at low doses. We therefore examined data
in children exposed at low doses to consider the following:
(1) RR patterns at doses ,0.2 Gy and ,0.1 Gy; (2) the
possible existence of a threshold dose; and (3) modification
of the dose response by sex, age at exposure, attained age,
years since exposure, and radiation dose fractionation.
Methods
Study populations
We used MEDLINE to identify 12 epidemiologic (10 cohort
and two case-control) studies of childhood external radiation
exposure and thyroid cancer and approached the principal
investigators to collaborate in a pooled data analysis. We re-
quired that studies had sufficient information for the calculation
of individualized, quantitative, thyroid gland–specific dose es-
timates and enrolled at least 1000 irradiated subjects or 10
thyroid cancers (8). Given the highly specialized characteristics
of the studies and, for cohorts, the need to accommodate
continued follow-up, we were confident that these studies
represented all eligible studies. After the pooling of data and
harmonization of variables, the current analysis restricted data
to doses ,0.2 Gy, except where noted. This resulted in the
exclusion of two case-control studies following treatment of
childhood cancer (11, 12) and one cohort study of childhood
lymphoid hyperplasia (13). Because there were no thyroid
cancer cases ,0.2 Gy, except for one nonexposed case for one
study (11), and because analyses adjusted for study, the three
omitted studies provided no information for the evaluation of
RR patterns. Nine cohorts remained, including treatment of
childhood cancer (n = 2), treatment of various benign diseases
(e.g., tinea capitis, enlarged thymus, hemangioma, and enlarged
tonsils and adenoids) (n = 6), and Japanese atomic bomb sur-
vivors (n = 1) (Supplemental Appendix). Detailed study-specific
descriptions and study-specific analyses were reported pre-
viously (8 and its supplemental material). Cases were those who
developed incident thyroid cancer during follow-up. Excluding
nonmelanoma skin cancer, cases represented first primary
cancers for studies of benign diseases and atomic bomb sur-
vivors and second primary cancers for studies of childhood
cancer survivors. We censored autopsy-identified thyroid can-
cers at death, but did not include them as cases.
The institutional review boards approved each participating
study and the data pooling.
Models for thyroid cancer risk
For seven cohorts, follow-up started at date of first radiation
exposure or enrollment for nonexposed (Supplemental Ap-
pendix). For the Atomic Bomb Survivors Study, follow-up
started in 1958, 13 years after exposure. For the Childhood
Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohorts, follow-up started 5
(CCSS-United States) or 3 years (CCSS-France/United King-
dom) after first cancer. Follow-up continued to the earliest date
of death, loss to follow-up, incident cancer other than non-
melanoma skin cancer, or end of study.

Thyroid Cancer at Low Radiation Doses

 Analyses used Poisson regression, with person-years of follow-
up cross-tabulated by study, sex, age at exposure, calendar year of
follow-up, time since exposure, attained age, treatment with
chemotherapy, thyroid radiation dose, and number of radiation
treatments, in which one treatment encompassed all doses within
6 months. Regressions adjusted for study, sex, and age and selected
study-specific variables. For the Israel Tinea Capitis Study, vari-
ables included country of origin (North Africa/others) and com-
parison group (sibling/population). For the Rochester Thymus
Study, variables included the presence of goiter (yes/no) and Jewish
religion (yes/no). For the Atomic Bomb Survivors Study, variables
included city of exposure (Hiroshima/Nagasaki), not in city at the
bombing (yes/no), and enrollment in the Adult Health Study (yes/
no), the latter variable accounting for possible surveillance-related
differences in thyroid cancer rates (10). For CCSS cohorts, addi-
tional variables included type of first cancer (Hodgkin lymphoma
or other) and chemotherapy treatment. Because most radiation-
exposed cases had only one treatment (84%), we assumed one
treatment of exposed patients who were missing number of
treatments. We computed person-years weighted means within
each cell of the cross-tabulation for continuous variables.
Supplemental Appendix provides methodologic details. The
regression model for thyroid cancer incidence rate, rðx; d; cÞ,
included adjustment variables x, thyroid radiation dose d, and
chemotherapy exposure c. We previously determined that an
additive relationship best described the joint association of
radiation exposure and chemotherapy treatment (c = 1 if yes and
c = 0 if no). Given x, the incidence rate under an additive re-
lationship for radiation dose and chemotherapy, termed non-
synergistic, is the sum of three terms: the incidence rate absent
both factors, rðx; 0; 0Þ, and the excess rates for each exposure at
the referent level of the other, frðx; d; 0Þ 2 rðx; 0; 0Þg and
frðx; 0; cÞ 2 rðx; 0; 0Þg (14, 15), i.e.,
rðx; d; cÞ ¼ rðx; 0; 0Þ þ frðx; d; 0Þ 2 rðx; 0; 0Þg
þ frðx; 0; cÞ 2 rðx; 0; 0Þg
Factoring the nonexposed thyroid cancer rate, r0ðxÞ ¼

(1)
where ERR(d) was the radiation-associated excess RR (ERR)
and u was the chemotherapy-associated ERR. We set r0ðxÞ ¼
expðf xÞ with f a vector of parameters. For ,0.2 Gy, we
fitted a simple linear model, ERRðdÞ ¼ b d, where b was the
ERR/Gy, i.e., the slope. We examined departures from linearity
with likelihood ratio tests and used a likelihood-based 95%
confidence interval (CI) for estimates of b.
A threshold identifies a dose below which there is no radi-
ation effect, whereas a linear threshold model specifies
a linear relationship starting at the threshold dose, i.e.,
ERRðdÞ ¼ bðd 2 hÞþ, where ðd 2 hÞþ ¼ maxð0; d 2 hÞ with h
the unknown threshold. We compared deviances to identify the
maximum likelihood estimate for the threshold. We also
modeled the dose response using a 4-knot cubic spline (16, 17).
Finally, we compared the full-dose range model (8), but fitted to
the nine cohorts in this analysis.
We used the Epicure program for all modeling (18).
Results
For doses ,0.2 and ,0.1 Gy, there were 252 and 184
radiation-exposed thyroid cancer cases, respectively, and
2,588,559 and 2,114,683 person-years of follow-up
(Supplemental Appendix). Among nonexposed individ-
uals, there were 142 thyroid cancer cases and 1,865,957
person-years.
Radiation dose response
For doses ,0.2 Gy, RRs increased significantly with
radiation dose (Table 1; Fig. 1, main panel, solid black
line) (P , 0.01), with no significant departure from
linearity (P = 0.77). A moving-average smoothing of RRs
(thick gray line) with 61 standard deviation (thin gray
line) highlighted the linear pattern. The downward ex-
trapolation from the curvilinear model-fitted to the full-
dose range closely approximated low-dose RRs (dash
line). Results were similar for ,0.1 Gy (inset panel), with
no departure from linearity (P = 0.66).
For ,0.2 and ,0.1 Gy, estimates of b were 11.1 (95%
CI, 6.6, 19.7) and 9.6 (95% CI, 3.7, 17.0), respectively,
with fitted RRs at 0.2 Gy of 3.2 (95% CI, 2.3, 4.3) and
2.9 (95% CI, 1.7, 4.5). Using the full-dose range model,
the fitted RR at 0.2 Gy was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1, 3.4).
The cubic spline was flat through 0.03 Gy (Fig. 1, dot
line), largely influenced by the RR of 0.9 (95% CI, 0.5, 1.6)
for the 0.0-2 to 0.03-Gy dose category with 13 cases
(Table 1). Nonetheless, the simple linear model had the
minimum Akaike Information Criterion (19), identifying it
as the preferred model.
Estimates of a threshold dose
We examined deviances to estimate threshold dose (h).
For ,0.2 Gy, deviances (open circle) and a moving-average
smoothing (solid line) increased (i.e., poorer fit) with
possible threshold values, with minimum deviance (star
symbol) at 0.00 Gy (Fig. 2, main panel). Deviances changed
little through 0.02 Gy. For ,0.1 Gy, the minimum de-
viance occurred at 0.025 Gy, with no change through
0.03 Gy (inset panel), indicating limited ability to identify a
specific threshold. One-sided upper 95% CIs were 0.036
for ,0.2 Gy and 0.044 for ,0.01 Gy (dash line).
Excess radiation-associated thyroid cancers
Using the equation for doses ,0.2 Gy, we estimated
37.2% radiation-associated thyroid cases (252 observed
with 93.8 excess exposed cases) (Table 1). This varied
from 5.7% (54 observed with 3.1 excess cases) for
doses ,0.02 Gy to 54.4% (68 observed with 37.0 excess
cases) for doses between 0.1 and 0.2 Gy.
Modification of the radiation dose response
The radiation dose response was similar by sex (P =
0.35) and number of treatments (P = 0.25) (Table 2). The
dose response generally increased with younger age
at exposure, except for those exposed under age 1 year

 (P = 0.01). Radiation dose responses decreased with greater
attained age (P = 0.01) and decreased but remained ele-
vated with years since exposure (P = 0.02), persisting
45 years and more after irradiation. Supplemental Appendix
displays fitted RRs at 0.2 Gy and models using continuous
modifiers, illustrating the wide CI for the RR under age
1 year. These effect modification patterns were similar for
doses ,0.1 Gy (Table 2), although estimates were less
stable. Results paralleled those in the
complete data (8).
Consistency of radiation effects
across cohorts
We evaluated the influence of each
study, with particular attention to the
Tinea Capitis Study and the Atomic
Bomb Survivors Study, because they
contributed 52% (132/252) and 28%
(70/252) of exposed cases, respectively.
For ,0.2 Gy and with an adjustment to
reflect age 5 years at exposure to ac-
count for cohort differences, the fitted
RR at 0.2 Gy was 3.2 (95% CI, 2.4, 4.5)
for all studies combined (Fig. 3, upper
panel). With the Tinea Capitis Study
omitted, the fitted RR estimate at 0.2 Gy
decreased 31% to 2.2 (95% CI, 1.5,
4.0), and with the Atomic Bomb Sur-
vivors Study omitted, the estimate in-
creased 25% to 4.0 (95% CI, 2.8, 6.1).
Omitting other studies individually, as
well as both CCSS cohorts, did not alter
the summary estimate. For ,0.1 Gy, the
Tinea Capitis and Atomic Bomb Survi-
vors Studies contributed 82% (150/282)
of exposed cases, and omission of each
study resulted in similar consequences.

Thyroid Cancer at Low Radiation Doses
J Clin Endocrinol Metab, July 2017, 102(7):2575–2583

 We assumed the same ERR/Gy applied in all study
populations. Allowing random effects for ERR/Gy (b)
due to population differences and adjusting for age at
exposure, Cochran Q-statistics were P = 0.89 for
doses ,0.2 Gy and P = 0.95 for doses ,0.1 Gy, indicating
homogeneity of the ERR/Gy across studies (20–22). The
random effects-fitted RRs at 0.2 Gy were 3.0 (95% CI,
2.1, 4.9) for ,0.2 Gy and 2.9 (95% CI, 1.7, 6.6)
for ,0.1 Gy.
Discussion
Given enhanced effects for childhood radiation exposures
and the well-documented radiosensitivity of the thyroid
gland, our pooling of all epidemiologic data with thyroid
radiation doses ,0.2 Gy enabled a direct assessment of a
linear dose–response relationship for thyroid cancer risk
and of a possible threshold dose. The analysis included
252 radiation-exposed thyroid cancer cases and was the
most definitive to date of thyroid cancer following low-
dose external radiation exposure.
For ,0.2 and ,0.1 Gy, RRs increased significantly
with thyroid radiation dose, with trends consistent with
linearity. Fitted estimates of RRs at these doses were also
consistent with downward extrapolations with previous
models based on all doses through 70
Gy and more. Consequently, our results
refute suggestions of no excess radiation-
related thyroid cancer risk below these
a priori restriction levels and support
linearity in ALARA assessments.
Estimates of a threshold dose were
0.0 Gy for ,0.2 Gy and 0.03 Gy
for ,0.1 Gy. These estimates derived
from the likelihood profile and there-
fore represented maximum likelihood
estimates (23). One-sided upper 95%
confidence limits were 0.036 and 0.044
Gy, respectively. Analysis did not ac-
count for dose measurement error,
which may have introduced bias, typ-
ically an underestimation (24, 25).
However, for the Atomic Bomb Sur-
vivors Study, we used measurement
error-adjusted dose estimates (26, 27).
For the Tinea Capitis Study, an anal-
ysis that accounted for measurement
error estimated a similar dose response
and assessment of effect modifiers (28,
29). With the Tinea Capitis and the
Atomic Bomb Survivors Studies com-
prising 80% of exposed cases and 57%
of exposed person-years, it was thus
unlikely that measurement error substantially affected
estimates of threshold dose, although a definitive con-
clusion was not possible.
A comprehensive accounting of dose measurement
error for all studies was beyond the scope of this paper. In
particular, we did not know to what extent dosimetric
conditions of the Tinea Capitis Study applied to other
studies. Nevertheless, we note one potential contribution
to dose measurement error for some CCSS participants,
namely, an underestimation of thyroid dose from addi-
tional radiological examinations associated with cancer
diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and follow-up. This
additional dose, more likely with head and neck cancers,
was not captured in the dose assessments and may have
amounted to 0.2 Gy and more. Because CCSS cohorts
included 5% of cases and 3% of person-years and be-
cause influence analysis indicated minimal impact from
the omission of CCSS, any underestimation of radiation
doses in CCSS data most likely involved minimal bias.
The 12-study pooled analysis supported a minimum
latency of 5 to 10 years (8). For 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to
19 years since exposure, there were 39, 65, and 128 exposed
thyroid cancers, respectively, and fitted RRs at 0.2 Gy were
1.7, 1.9, and 3.3. For ,5 years since exposure, there were
three cases and the RR was not estimable. An important

 question was whether a similar latency applied for those
exposed only at low doses. For ,0.2 Gy, there were 3, 13,
and 20 exposed cases for 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 19 years
since exposure, respectively, and fitted RRs at 0.2 Gy were
2.9 (95% CI, ,0.0, 11.7), 6.2 (95% CI, 2.8, 13.5), and 5.5
(95% CI, 2.6, 10.6). For ,0.1 Gy, there were 3, 10, and 8
exposed cases in the time since exposure categories, and
estimated RRs at 0.2 Gy were 3.5 (95% CI, 0.7, 11.1), 4.8
(95% CI, 1.8, 10.5), and 1.6 (95% CI, 0.3, 4.1). Although
data were limited, fitted RRs in the restricted data appeared
compatible with a minimum latency of 5 to 10 years.
We previously identified an additive (nonsynergistic)
relationship for the RRs of thyroid radiation dose and
chemotherapy for childhood cancer and thyroid cancer
incidence (8). We refitted models for two subsets of the
data to remove any residual uncertainty about a non-
synergistic relationship chemotherapy: (1) participants
who did not receive chemotherapy, and (2) participants in
the seven non-CCSS. The estimated ERR/Gy was 11.0 for
participants without chemotherapy and 11.1 for the
seven cohorts, resulting in fitted RRs at 0.2 Gy of 3.2 for
both subsets. This equaled the fitted RR of 3.2 for data
with doses ,0.2 Gy, indicating choice of risk model for
chemotherapy did not impact results.
Vaccarella et al. (30) have suggested that increased
medical surveillance and new diagnostic techniques are
important factors in recent worldwide increases in the
incidence rates for thyroid cancer. Although medical
screening may have increased the ascertainment of thy-
roid cancer cases, there was little reason to presuppose
that increased screening was also related to radiation dose
and thus acted to confound our results. Information on
thyroid cancer–screening practices was not explicitly
available for all studies in our pooling; however, analytic
evaluation was possible in two studies. Ron et al. (10)
considered the effect of screening using surrogate in-
formation on the potential for heightened medical sur-
veillance in the Atomic Bomb Survivors Study and the
Michael Reese Hospital Study. For the former, Ron et al.
(10) evaluated participation in the Adult Health Study, a
companion study starting in 1958 that involved ;20% of
subjects who were invited to biennial clinical examina-
tions. For the latter, Ron et al. (10) used calendar year
1974 as an approximate indicator year for the start of
heightened public awareness of radiation effects and
heightened surveillance. Analyses revealed the expected
increase in the absolute rate of thyroid cancer incidence,
but also found no significant variation in the radiation
dose response for the RR of thyroid cancer (10). In the
current analysis of restricted data, we similarly found no
significant variation in the linear radiation dose–response
parameter by participation in the Adult Health Study for
the Atomic Bomb Survivor Study (P = 0.39). With one
case, we could not assess the Michael Reese Hospital
Study. We also evaluated variation of the radiation dose
response across categories of calendar year of follow-up,
reasoning that confounding from enhanced thyroid

 screening was more likely to have occurred in recent
years. After adjustment for attained age, we found no
significant variation of the radiation dose response by
calendar year (P = 0.32).
With the nuclear releases from the
1986 Chernobyl power plant accident
and from the Fukushima Daiichi power
plant following the 2011 Great East
Japan Earthquake and Tsunami, there
are questions about comparative thy-
roid cancer risks for childhood exposure
to low radiation doses from external
and internal sources. External sources of
exposure derive mainly from x- and
g-irradiation, whereas internal sources
derive mainly from short-lived b-radi-
ation decay of iodine-131 (1, 31–35).
Studies of thyroid cancer in children
exposed following the Chernobyl acci-
dent have reported a range of RRs. RR
estimates at 0.2 Gy were 1.9 from a
Russian Federation–Belarus study (36),
1.9 from a Ukraine study (37), with a
more recent estimate of 1.2 (38), and 1.2
from a Belarus study (39). Our analy-
sis of external thyroid radiation dose
yielded an estimate of 3.2 (95% CI, 2.3,
4.3). For those aged ,5 years at expo-
sure, RR estimates at 0.2 Gy were 2.6 in
the Ukraine study (37) and 1.9 in the
Belarus study (39), whereas our estimate
was 3.4 (95% CI, 2.0, 4.8). These results
suggested the possibility of a slightly
greater thyroid cancer risk from child-
hood external irradiation. Definitive
conclusions are problematic due to
the substantial differences between our
populations of medically exposed in-
dividuals and atomic bomb survivors
and the Chernobyl-exposed populations
who were mildly to moderately iodine
deficient and/or intensely screened (40).
The use of computed tomography
(CT) scanning for medical diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures has increased sub-
stantially in recent years in both adults
and children, with children in the United
States now receiving 5 to 9 million scans
per year (41, 42) (http://www.cancer.
gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/
radiation/pediatric-ct-scans). CT scans
of children can result in thyroid radi-
ation doses of 0.010 Gy for head CTs
(38, 43), 0.027 Gy for chest CTs (43–45), 0.050 Gy for neck
CTs (46, 47), 0.036 Gy for cervical spine CTs (48), and
0.008 Gy for abdominal CTs (43). With CT scans often
repeated, multidetector row CT scans reducing scan times

 and enabling increased use of CT scans in pediatric medicine
and the use of multiphase (repeat scanning before and after
contrast injection) CT examinations, there is a high potential
for pediatric patients to receive thyroid doses for which there
is a demonstrably increased risk of thyroid cancer.
For a given total dose, the number of radiation
treatments did not modify risks, although numbers of
thyroid cancer cases with multiple treatments were lim-
ited (the Israel Tinea Study, Hemangioma–Stockholm
Study, and Hemangioma–G¨
oteborg Study contributed
10, 9, and 1 cases, respectively). Pooled analyses of seven
studies, a subset of the current studies (10), 12 studies
across the full range of doses including 144 cases with
multiple treatments (8), and our current analysis do not
support a significant dose fractionation effect. Notably,
these analyses did observe a reduced strength of associ-
ation with multiple radiation treatments, albeit not sta-
tistically significant. Harmonization of fractionation data
was challenging due to diverse and calendar year varying
treatment protocols and limited information on treat-
ment specifics for the studies. Various definitions of dose
fraction were possible. Due to harmonization necessities,
we defined one treatment as all radiation doses received
within 6 months. This resulted in the large majority of
patients receiving one radiation treatment, diminishing
our ability to evaluate fractionation.
Inconclusion, theseanalysesreinforcedtheexistenceofan
excess thyroid cancer risk at doses ,0.2 and ,0.1 Gy, and
perhaps at even lower doses. The consistency of the linear
radiation dose response at low doses and the apparent ab-
sence of a significant radiation fractionation effect reaffirm
that the direct application of a linear relationship remains the
most plausible approach for the extrapolation of radiation-
associated thyroid cancer risk (49) and adds support to the
use of a linear model for ALARA assessments (50).
