Human evolution is widely thought to have involved a particular
expansion of prefrontal cortex. This popular notion has recently been
challenged, although controversies remain. Here we show that the
prefrontal region of both human and nonhuman primates holds
about 8% of cortical neurons, with no clear difference across humans
and other primates in the distribution of cortical neurons or white
matter cells along the anteroposterior axis. Further, we find that the
volumes of human prefrontal gray and white matter match the
expected volumes for the number of neurons in the gray matter and
for the number of other cells in the white matter compared with
other primate species. These results indicate that prefrontal cortical
expansion in human evolution happened along the same allometric
trajectory as for other primate species, without modification of the
distribution of neurons across its surface or of the volume of the
underlying white matter. We thus propose that the most distinctive
feature of the human prefrontal cortex is its absolute number of
neurons, not its relative volume.

uman evolution was long thought to have involved a selective
enlargement of the prefrontal cortex, the cortical region related
to some of our remarkable cognitive abilities such as personality
expression, planning, and decision making (1, 2). However, re-
cent publications showed that the gray matter of the human
prefrontal cortex has the expected volume for a primate with the
same brain size (3–5) and therefore does not diverge from the
allometric rule of great apes—although Passingham and Smaers
(6) still claim that the volume of the human prefrontal gray
matter is larger than expected based on the volumes of the striate
and motor areas in the brain. The amount of white matter is also
still a subject of debate. The prefrontal white matter was observed
to be significantly expanded in humans compared with other pri-
mates (4), especially in the left hemisphere (5), compared with the
gray matter of the same region. However, analyzing the same data
but accounting for the statistical effects of phylogenetic non-
independence among species, Barton and Venditti (7) observed
instead that the volume of the prefrontal white matter in humans is
not larger than expected for the volume of prefrontal gray matter,
nonprefrontal white matter, or nonprefrontal gray matter. It seems
from the controversy that any possible exceptionality of the white
matter volume of the human prefrontal cortex must be small, be-
cause an exceptionality depends on the statistical analysis applied.
Still, those studies were limited to the use of the only parameter
available then, cortical volume, which we now know not to be a
simple, direct reflection of numbers of neurons across cortical
areas (8, 9). If the human prefrontal cortex was preferentially
expanded in evolution, then its gray matter should hold a rela-
tively larger fraction of all cortical neurons. If, instead, the human
prefrontal white matter was preferentially expanded in evolution,
then it should be composed of more cells than expected for its
volume and for its number of prefrontal neurons. Alternatively, if the
human prefrontal gray matter does have a relatively enlarged
fraction of all cortical neurons, then the underlying white matter
would also be expected to contain a relatively enlarged population
of cells myelinating a larger number of connecting fibers.
Here we test these hypotheses by performing a systematic
analysis of neuron distribution along the anteroposterior (A-P)
axis of the cerebral cortex across eight primate species, including
humans (9). We use the isotropic fractionator (10), a nonstereological
method that yields results similar to those obtained with stereology
(11), to analyze numbers of neurons and other cells in a systematic
series of 2-mm coronal sections along the A-P axis of one cortical
hemisphere of each species. For the purposes of this study, we define
the prefrontal region of the cerebral cortex as all gray and white
matter anterior to the corpus callosum in the coronal plane,
according to Schoenemann et al. (4). In nonhuman primates, this
region includes granular frontal cortex, orbital frontal cortex,
ventromedial frontal cortex, and some rostral cingulate cortex, but
not motor cortex and little of premotor cortex (12, 13). Although
defining prefrontal region as anterior to the callosum is necessary
due to the lack of reliable anatomical criteria to define the pre-
frontal cortex across all species (14), and because the thin histo-
logical slices required for cytoarchitectural analysis preclude using
the isotropic fractionator to count neurons, it is an easily applicable
criterion to all primate species and, most importantly, it makes our
findings directly comparable to those of Schoenemann et al. (4).

Significance
Human brain evolution is often considered synonymous with
cortical expansion, in particular of the prefrontal cortex, a cor-
tical region required for our remarkable cognitive abilities such
as personality expression, planning, and decision making. In this
study, we show that the expansion of numbers of cortical neu-
rons in human and nonhuman primate evolution occurred in a
similar manner across the cortex, without an increase in the rel-
ative number of neurons in the prefrontal region, and without a
relative increase in the number of cells in the prefrontal white
matter. One thing that distinguishes the human brain from other
primate brains is thus not the relative size of its prefrontal cortex
but its absolute number of neurons.

 other cells in the white matter (VW/OW) is smaller in those
sections anterior to the corpus callosum (Fig. S1). The VW/OW ratio
is not an accurate estimate of absolute white matter fiber caliber
across species, because the fraction of nonmyelinated fibers and the
proportion of myelin to fiber caliber are unknown. Still, the VW/OW
ratio is a useful parameter for comparing variations in average fiber
caliber within an individual cortex, because the ratio is proportional
to the average cross-sectional area of myelinated axons (15). Thus,
the smaller VW/OW ratio in sections anterior to the callosum (and
therefore defined as prefrontal) suggests that these sections contain
fibers of smaller caliber, in line with the previous finding that callosal
fibers are thinnest at the genu (9, 16, 17). This consonance supports
the conclusion that cortex anterior to the callosum indeed defines
comparable prefrontal cortical regions across primate species, in-
cluding humans (4, 18–21), even if these zones do not correspond to
the entire associative areas in the frontal lobe.
Cumulative Distribution of Neurons and Other Cells. The distribution
of cumulative gray matter volume (VGM) along the A-P axis does
not correspond linearly to the cumulative distribution of cortical
neurons in the same axis. In most species, the prefrontal region
accumulates fewer neurons than expected for its cumulative volume
(Fig. 1A and Table S1), which can be explained by the heteroge-
neous neuron density distribution across the A-P axis, with a large
extent of cortex displaying higher neuronal densities in the posterior
pole (Fig. 2). The prefrontal region corresponds to the anteriormost
10% of VGM or less in all species but Papio and accumulates 6–8%
of all cortical neurons in six of the eight species, including humans
(Table S1), whereas the posteriormost 10% of the VGM accumu-
lates 20% of the cortical neurons.
Importantly, across all species examined the cumulative distribu-
tion of neurons along the A-P axis varies as a similar function of the
cumulative percentage of VGM (Fig. 1A). The overlap suggests that
the eight species, including humans, share a similar neuronal distri-
bution along the cortical surface, notwithstanding the 40-fold varia-
tion in volume across species. These findings are compatible with a
scenario in which cortical expansion in primate evolution happened
without a change in the pattern of neuron distribution across the
surface.
The cumulative percentage of neurons along the A-P axis also
varies as a similar function of the cumulative percentage of the
volume of white matter (VWM) across all eight species (Fig. 1B).
Again, the two cumulative distributions are not linearly related:
Whereas the prefrontal region holds 8% of all cortical neurons
and less than 10% of VGM in most species, it contains typically
less than 4% of VWM (Fig. 1B and Table S1).
Interestingly, the cumulative distribution of other cells in the
white matter (OWM) along the A-P axis varies with the cumulative
number of cortical neurons in a similar fashion across five species,
including humans, but differently from Papio, Cebus, and Saguinus,
for which OWM accumulates linearly with the number of neurons
along the axis (Fig. 1C). Likewise, the cumulative distribution of
VWM along the A-P axis varies similarly across human and macaque
cortices, although it differs in Cebus and Papio (Fig. 1D).
Neuronal Density Along the Cerebral Cortex. The distribution of
neurons along the A-P axis of the cerebral cortex exhibits a
double gradient of neuronal density in all nonhuman primates,
with the highest densities found in the frontal and occipital poles
(Fig. 2). Within each nonhuman species, neuronal densities are
higher in the prefrontal pole than in the intermediate region and
increase posteriorly within the occipital region. In the human
cortex, in contrast, the lowest neuronal densities occur in the
prefrontal region and part of intermediate cortex (possibly motor
cortex), and a gradient of neuronal densities is only seen within
the occipital region (9) (Fig. 2, black).
At first sight, the lowest neuronal densities in the human
prefrontal region suggest a particularity of this species. However,
quantitative analysis across nonhuman species shows that aver-
age neuronal density in the prefrontal region scales across spe-
cies, decreasing as a power function of increasing prefrontal
VGM (Fig. 3A), which suggests that average neuronal cell size
increases with increasing gray matter volume in the prefrontal
region. Most importantly, the low neuronal density in the human
prefrontal region conforms to this scaling. A similar scaling of
average neuronal density, decreasing with increasing local VGM
across nonhuman species, applies to the intermediate (Fig. 3B)
and occipital (Fig. 3C) regions of the cortex, and there again the
human cortex fits the rules. Functions calculated using phylo-
genetically independent contrasts are similar to the functions
calculated for raw data for these and all other analyses (Table
S2), and therefore all figures show only the plotted raw data.
Scaling of the Cortical Gray Matter. Across the seven nonhuman
primate species, VGM scales as similar power functions of the
number of neurons in each of the three cortical regions (pre-
frontal, intermediate, and occipital; Fig. 4). In particular, and in
agreement with the decreasing neuronal density with increasing
VGM in each region (which indicates increasing average neuronal
cell size), the gray matter volume of the prefrontal region varies
across nonhuman species as a power function of the number of
cortical neurons in the region with an exponent of 1.290 ± 0.118
(r2 = 0.960, P = 0.0001; Fig. 4A). Strikingly, the value for the human
cerebral cortex fits the relationship for nonhumans (Fig. 4A, black).
The same pattern is found for the intermediate (Fig. 4B) and oc-
cipital (Fig. 4C) regions, in which the human cortical gray matter
has the volume expected for its number of neurons. The similar
exponents across all cortical regions suggest that the prefrontal
region does not become preferentially expanded over other cortical
regions as it gains neurons. Most importantly, the conformity of the
human cortex to the nonhuman scaling relationships indicates that
the human prefrontal gray matter does not hold an extraordinarily
larger volume of gray matter for its number of neurons.
Scaling of the Cortical White Matter. Across the seven nonhuman
species, VWM in each cortical region scales with OWM as similar
power functions across cortical regions (Fig. 5 A–C). Again, the
human VWM in each cortical region remains well inside the

Similar distribution of neurons along the A-P cortex across all species.
Cumulative distributions (in percent) begin in the anterior (frontal) pole, at

varies similarly with the cumulative distribution of VGM (A) and with the cu-
mulative distribution of VWM (B) across all species, whereas there are two
patterns of variation in the cumulative distribution of other cells in the white
matter with the cumulative number of neurons (C) and VWM (D). However, the

 calculated confidence intervals (Fig. 5 A–C, black), indicating
that the white matter of each region of the human cortex has the
expected volume for its cellular composition.
Most importantly, we find that the human subcortical white
matter in each cortical region also has the volume expected for the
number of cortical neurons in the region as predicted from the
relationships that apply to nonhuman primate species (Fig. 5 D–F).
The conformity of human white matter volumes in cortical regions
to the values predicted for their respective numbers of neurons
suggests that human evolution has involved neither a significant
expansion of prefrontal white matter volume beyond the expected
for the local number of neurons nor a significant expansion of the
white matter volume beneath other cortical regions.
Human Prefrontal Cortex Is Not Relatively Expanded. To test the
hypothesis that the human prefrontal cortex is expanded in its
number of neurons or white matter cells compared with the re-
mainder cortical regions relative to other primates, regardless of
the volume of the structures, we performed the analyses shown in
Fig. 6. We find that, across nonhuman primates, the number of
neurons in the prefrontal region varies with the total number of
neurons in the other, nonprefrontal regions as a power function
of exponent of 0.917 ± 0.220 (r2 = 0.776, P = 0.0088), not sig-
nificantly different from linearity (Fig. 6A). This linearity in-
dicates that, across nonhuman primates, the prefrontal region
gains neurons proportionately with the rest of the cortex, without
positive allometry, and therefore without significant expansion.
Crucially, we find that the number of neurons in the human
prefrontal region matches the expected for its number of neurons
in nonprefrontal regions, given the relationship found across non-
human primates (Fig. 6A, black). The human prefrontal region,
therefore, is not expanded in its number of neurons compared with
other cortical regions.
Finally, we find that, across nonhuman primates, the number
of other cells in the prefrontal white matter varies with the total
number of other cells in the remainder (nonprefrontal) white
matter as a power function of exponent 0.966 ± 0.256 (r2 = 0.739,
P = 0.0131), also not significantly different from linearity (Fig.
6B). Because other cells in the white matter are presumably
myelinating oligodendrocytes in their majority, this linearity in-
dicates an isometric expansion of the total length of myelinated
fibers in the primate prefrontal white matter compared with the
other cortical regions. Again, the number of other cells in the
human prefrontal white matter matches the expected for its
number of other cells in the white matter of other, nonprefrontal
cortical regions (Fig. 6B, black), conforming to the scaling rules
that apply to other primates. The human prefrontal white matter
is therefore not expanded over other cortical regions, compared
with other primate species.
Discussion
Here we show that the human prefrontal region, in comparison
with that of other primates, has (i) the expected number of
neurons for its gray matter volume, (ii) the expected number of
neurons for the total number of neurons in the remainder of the
cortex, (iii) the white matter volume expected for the number of
neurons in the region, and (iv) the expected volume and number
of other cells in the white matter for the volume and number of
other cells in the remainder of the nonprefrontal subcortical
white matter. In particular, we find that the prefrontal region of
the cortex (anterior to the corpus callosum) holds a similar 8%
of all neurons in human and nonhuman primates alike. All these
results point to the same two conclusions: that primate evolution
did not involve a shift in the distribution of cortical neurons
toward prefrontal regions and that human evolution, in particular,
did not involve an expansion of the relative number of neurons or
relative total length of myelinated fibers in the prefrontal region
over other primates. Our findings thus concur with the conclusion
of Barton and Venditti (7) that human frontal cortex is not pro-
portionately larger than expected for a nonhuman primate of our
cortical size, with no evidence of a relative enlargement of the
human prefrontal white matter.
The present analysis of a single hemisphere of each species
does not allow the analysis of variables such as interindividual
variability, gender, and age on the distribution of neurons along
the cerebral cortex. However, the fact that we found overlapping
cumulative distributions of numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal
cells and gray and white matter volumes even when single hemi-
spheres were analyzed for each species (Fig. 2), when interindividual
variability is known to exist (22, 23), only makes it more likely that
the distribution of neurons and white matter is indeed similar in
human and nonhuman primate species. We find this similarity all the
more remarkable given that our sample does not include nonhuman
ape species.
Our analysis of the distribution of neurons along the A-P axis
of the cerebral cortex demonstrates a previously unknown U-shaped
distribution of neuronal densities, with higher densities in the
prefrontal pole, lower densities in the intermediate area, and
densities increasing again toward the occipital pole. Because our
analysis was restricted to the A-P axis, we cannot at this point
address the possibility of yet another orthogonal gradient su-
perposed onto the double A-P gradients. Still, the U-shaped
pattern found here is in contrast to the single gradient proposed
by Finlay et al. (24) and, in particular, by Charvet et al. (25), both
based partially on the data of Collins et al. (8). The inconsistency
across those studies and our results cannot be assigned to the

 method used to count cells, because Collins et al. (8) also used
the isotropic fractionator, and this method has proven to have
high internal consistency and to be at least as reliable as stereology
(11). We believe that those authors failed to detect this U-shaped
pattern because the original data they used were not based on a
systematic, front-to-back analysis of neuronal densities in the pri-
mate cerebral cortex, but rather a bidimensional distribution of
data points obtained from flattened cortices that make the dorsal
cortex of the frontal pole no longer appear as the most anterior
region of the cortex. Indeed, the flattened baboon cortex shown
originally in Collins et al. (8) and recently in one flattened chim-
panzee cortex (26) had a clear cluster of high neuronal densities in
prefrontal patches that are located in the frontal pole of the folded
cortex (although not in the anteriormost part of the unfolded,
flattened cortex). In contrast, our systematic analysis of coronal
sections along the A-P pole, starting with the frontal pole and ending
with the occipital pole, indicates clearly the existence of two inverted
gradients of neuronal density, peaking at both cortical poles.
That such a U-shaped pattern is not found in the human
cortex (9) is explained simply by the scaling of the prefrontal
cortical gray matter with decreasing densities across species as
the number of cortical neurons increases (that is, with increasing
average neuronal size in the gray matter as the cortex gains
neurons), which leads to an overall flattening of the distribution
of neuronal densities across the A-P axis. In line with this
possibility, there is also no distinguishable U-shape pattern in
Macaca nemestrina, the second largest cortex analyzed. The low
neuron densities in the human prefrontal cortex are consistent
with the increasing distance between pyramidal neurons in area
10 compared with other regions (27), in addition to a higher
arborization of pyramidal neurons in layer III in comparison with
the rest of the cortex (28, 29). These findings suggest that the
dendritic length in human area 10, the frontal pole, is the highest
of the cerebral cortex, which in turn suggests larger neurons with
more synapses in this region, consistent with their associative
function (30).
Importantly, the U-shaped pattern of neuronal densities across
the primate cortex departs from the correlation between order of
neurogenesis across the cortical surface and neuronal density
proposed by Finlay et al. (24). Order of neurogenesis may indeed
explain the generation of a larger number of neurons in the de-
veloping occipital region—although this order does not provide a
mechanism to account for how these neurons are smaller and so
occur at a greater neuronal density—but neurogenesis order does
not explain the large neuronal densities also found in the frontal
pole. It seems that other factors also determine the average size
of cortical neurons and the fraction connected through the white
matter in each cortical zone, as proposed previously (9, 31). By
recognizing that the A-P gradient of neuron generation time does
not truly account for the variation in their sizes and densities,
further study will be necessary to identify the different mecha-
nisms by which the quantitative differences between the three
regions observed here are formed, including the generation of the
two neuronal density gradients found peaking in the prefrontal
and occipital poles.
Expansion of Cortical Areas Without a Change in the Relative Distribution
of Cortical Neurons. We have previously found that the primary visual
cortex, the primary auditory cortex, and the primary motor cortex
occupy a similar percentage of the cortical surface and hold a
similar percentage of all cortical neurons across nonhuman pri-
mates (32–34). Those findings are consistent with the present re-
port of a similar pattern of distribution of neurons along the A-P
axis of the cerebral cortex across primate species. In contrast,
Chaplin et al. (35) have shown that some associative cortical areas
are relatively larger in larger primate species (capuchin and ma-
caque) than in a smaller species (marmoset), which suggests that
they have undergone relative expansion in primate evolution, and
therefore might be expected to have relatively larger numbers of
neurons. Similarly, Hill et al. (36) found that, compared with the
macaque, the human cerebral cortex has relatively expanded lat-
eral temporal, frontal, and parietal regions, which suggests an
expansion of these areas in human evolution.
How can the relative expansion of some cortical areas over
others be reconciled with our findings of no significant change in
the relative distribution of neurons over the A-P axis of the
cortex? We suggest that the shared cumulative distribution of
neurons along the A-P axis is the result of a basic layout of

Human prefrontal white matter volume scales as expected for its
number of other cells and neurons in the adjacent gray matter. Each graph
shows how the total VWM in the prefrontal (A and D), intermediate (B and E),
and occipital regions (C and F) in each species scales with the number of
other cells in the white matter (A–C) or gray matter (D–F) of that cortical
region. Plotted functions exclude the human data points (in black). Expo-
nents are (A, prefrontal) 1.176 ± 0.222 (r2 = 0.848, P = 0.0032), (B, in-
termediate) 1.241 ± 0.254 (r2 = 0.827, P = 0.0045), (C, occipital) 1.137 ± 0.211
(r2 = 0.853, P = 0.0030), (D, prefrontal) 1.656 ± 0.298 (r2 = 0.860, P = 0.0026),
(E, intermediate) 1.644 ± 0.208 (r2 = 0.926, P = 0.0005), and (F, occipital)
1.557 ± 0.260 (r2 = 0.878, P = 0.0019). Notice that the human subcortical
white matter has the expected volume both for the local number of other
cells composing the white matter and for the number of neurons in the gray
matter in each of the three cortical regions, including the prefrontal cortex.

 neurons in the cortical sheet, according to mechanisms that
control numbers of neurons and cell size during development (9,
31), that is conserved across species. These neurons are then
allocated to particular functions depending on the pattern of
thalamic and cortical connectivity that they establish. Thus, the
functional identity of a particular anatomical region of cortex
may change across species, becoming relatively expanded or
contracted and thus containing more or fewer neurons, without a
necessary change in the distribution of neurons along the A-P
axis of the cortical sheet.
What Distinguishes Humans from Other Primates? Using the same
criterion to define prefrontal regions as Schoenemann et al. (4),
our data on the distribution of neurons support the conclusions
of Barton and Venditti (7) regarding the nonextraordinary na-
ture of the human prefrontal cortex. In addition, we show that
the A-P distribution of cortical neurons is similar in human and
nonhuman species, and just as there are not relatively more
neurons in the human prefrontal region, there are not relatively
fewer neurons in other cortical regions. Instead, it is only abso-
lute numbers of neurons that are increased in human cortex
compared with other species. The increased number of non-
prefrontal neurons presumably contributes to improving non-
associative functions in human brains relative to other species.
Additionally, an overall increase in the number of cortical areas
proposed for primates with increasing cortical size (37), and there-
fore increasing number of neurons, should also contribute to adding
complexity to sensory-motor processing in larger cortices.
We also extend the conclusions of Barton and Venditti (7) to
the number of neurons in the human prefrontal cortex and the
total length of myelinated fibers in the prefrontal white matter,
inferred from the number of other cells (presumably mostly ol-
igodendrocytes) in the white matter, showing that the human
prefrontal cortex does not deviate from the primate pattern in
these criteria. Our findings indicate that the number of neurons
and white matter connectivity of the human prefrontal region did
not expand disproportionately to other cortical areas in human
evolution. Incidentally, the prefrontal region that is considered
to be associative in the mouse cortex also accumulates 8% of all
cortical neurons (31), which raises the possibility that the relative
allocation of neurons to associative functions is shared at least
between primates and rodents, which are closely related in
mammalian evolution.
Not surprisingly, the same 8% of all cerebral cortical neurons
found in the prefrontal region correspond to a much larger ab-
solute number of neurons in human (1.3 billion) than in other
primate brains (e.g., macaque, 137 million), regardless of the
relative size of the prefrontal cortex. Although a number of ge-
netic changes specific to the human brain have been found (38–
43) and certainly play some role in human cognition, we propose
that this larger absolute number of neurons in human prefrontal,
associative cortical regions is the main factor underlying the
complexity of our cognitive abilities in comparison with other
primates, and possibly all other mammals. As for nonassociative
regions (37), the ensuing increase in number of cortical pre-
frontal areas expected with an increased absolute number of
neurons and absolute cortical size would be an additional factor
to contribute to increased complexity of associative processing in
humans compared with other primate species.
Materials and Methods
To ensure that the distribution of cells along the entire cerebral cortex could be
compared directly across species, we chose to examine the numbers of neuronal
and other cells found in the gray and white matter systematically across a
complete series of 2 mm coronal sections along the A-P axis of one hemisphere of
each species. Each section had the cortical gray and white matter dissected and
counted separately, using the isotropic fractionator (10). Each section was
assigned as prefrontal (that is, located anterior to the corpus callosum), occipital
(that is, situated in the posterior third of the cortical gray matter volume), or
intermediate (located between prefrontal and occipital). Occipital region is
defined after the finding by Ribeiro et al. (9) that the posterior third of the
human cortical gray matter scales differently from the rest of the cerebral
cortex. That a similar criterion could be applied to other, nonhuman primate
species is supported by the findings of Collins et al. (34) that V1 occupies a
similar fraction of the cortical surface and is comprised of a similar percentage
of all cortical neurons in a range of nonhuman primate species comparable to
those analyzed here. Within each section in the intermediate region of the A-P
axis, temporal and dorsal areas were processed separately, and their numbers
later combined for each section. This approach allowed the comparison of the
absolute, relative and cumulative distributions of numbers of neurons and
other cells along the A-P axis across nonhuman primate species and their
comparison with similar published data for the human cerebral cortex (9), de-
spite their different cortical volumes. Further, this approach also allowed the
determination of the scaling rules that apply to each cortical region.
Animals. We analyzed one hemisphere of each of the following seven primate
species: Macaca fascicularis, Papio cynocephalus, Saguinus midas niger, Oto-
lemur garnettii, Aotus trivirgatus, Cebus apella, and M. nemestrina. All animals
were adults at the time of the experiments; more specifically, Papio was a 6-y-
old female, Saguinus was a 4-y-old male, and Cebus was a 6-y-old female. The
sex and precise age of the other animals was not recorded. The hemispheres of
M. fascicularis, O. garnettii, P. cynocephalus, A. trivirgatus, and M. nemestrina
were obtained from colonies in the Department of Psychology at Vanderbilt
University. All veterinary care and procedures reported herein were performed
according to the ethical standards of the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. The S. midas niger and C. apella hemispheres were
obtained from the colony at the Centro de Primatologia at Belém, Pará, Brazil,
in accordance with the local ethics committee and with authorization from the
Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources.
The human cortex studied here was obtained from the death certification
service at Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. That cortex was previously an-
alyzed by Ribeiro et al. (9), whose data were analyzed here.
Surface and Volume Reconstruction. Nonhuman primate brains were removed
from the skull after transecting the spinal cord at the level of the foramen mag
num, weighed, and postfixed for 2 wk to 12 mo by immersion in 4% (vol/vol)
phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde. The cerebral cortex in all animals was
defined as all cortical regions lateral to the olfactory tract, including hippo-
campus and piriform cortex. Each hemisphere was embedded in 3% (vol/vol)
agar and sectioned in a coronal series of 2-mm sections along the A-P axis with
a large-capacity industrial deli cutter (Filizola). Sections were scanned on a
flatbed scanner at a resolution of 1,200 dots per inch.
For each section, we defined surface area (AG) as the total gray matter surface
including gyri and sulci and the external surface area (AE) as the smallest surface
of gray matter that did not enter sulci. Other measures include surface area of
the white matter (AW), volume of the gray matter subcortical (VW), and the
volume of the gray matter (VG). To determine surface and cortical volume we

The human prefrontal region is not expanded in number of neurons
or total length of myelinated fibers in the white matter relative to other
cortical regions. (A) Total number of neurons in the prefrontal region of
each nonhuman species varies as a power function of the total number of
neurons in the remainder (nonprefrontal) regions with exponent 0.917 ±
0.220 (r2 = 0.776, P = 0.0088), not significantly different from linearity. The
human prefrontal region (black data point) matches the nonhuman re-
lationship. (B) Total number of other cells in the prefrontal region of the
white matter (supposedly oligodendrocytes in their majority, and therefore
proportional to the total length of myelinated fibers in the prefrontal white
matter) varies across nonhuman species as a power function of the total
number of other cells in the nonprefrontal white matter regions with ex-
ponent 0.966 ± 0.256 (r2 = 0.739, P = 0.0131), also not significantly different
from linearity. The human prefrontal white matter (black data point)
matches the nonhuman relationship.

Isotropic Fractionator. The total number of neurons and other cells in the gray
and white matter were estimated applying the isotropic fractionator (10), which
consists of transforming the tissue of interest in a homogeneous solution of free
nuclei that when labeled with DAPI (diluted 20–50× from a stock solution of
20 mg/L; Invitrogen) allows the quantification of the total number of cells in a
structure. To determine the total number of neurons in the solution, we per-
formed immunocytochemistry for NeuN (Cy3-conjugated rabbit polyclonal an-
tibody; Millipore) by calculating the fraction of at least 500 DAPI-positive nuclei
in each sample that expressed NeuN. The fraction of NeuN-positive nuclei in
each region of interest multiplied by the total number of cells in the structure
yields the total number of neurons in the sample. The total number of non-
neuronal cells (that is, total number of cells minus number of NeuN-positive
nuclei) in the white matter is referred to as the number of “other cells,” which
are presumably mostly myelinating oligodendrocytes. Due to overfixation that
precluded immunocytochemistry, the fraction of neuronal nuclei in Papio sam-
ples was performed according to morphological criteria, which increases the risk
of confusing small interneuronal nuclei with oligodendrocyte nuclei (44), and
thus might reduce estimates of numbers of neurons and neuronal density.
Statistical Analysis. Power functions were calculated using least-squares re-
gression of log-transformed raw data in JMP 9.0 (SAS). Phylogenetically in-
dependent contrasts for each variable were calculated using the PDAP
module in Mesquite (mesquiteproject.wikispaces.com) applying the evolu-
tionary tree in Purvis (1995). Least-squares linear regressions through the
origin were then calculated for the contrasts using JMP 9.0. The power
functions for raw data and phylogenetically independent contrasts, which
are indistinguishable, are given in Table S2.
