Background: A lack of adequate guidance on menstrual management; water, disposal, and private changing
facilities; and sanitary hygiene materials in low- and middle-income countries leaves schoolgirls with limited
options for healthy personal hygiene during monthly menses. While a plethora of observational studies have
described how menstrual hygiene management (MHM) barriers in school impact girls’ dignity, well-being,
and engagement in school activities, studies have yet to confirm if inadequate information and facilities for
MHM significantly affects quantifiable school and health outcomes influencing girls’ life chances. Evidence
on these hard outcomes will take time to accrue; however, a current lack of standardized methods, tools, and
research funding is hampering progress and must be addressed.
Objectives: Compile research priorities for MHM and types of research methods that can be used.
Results: In this article, we highlight the current knowledge gaps in school-aged girls’ MHM research, and
identifyopportunities for addressing the dearth of hard evidence limiting the ability of governments, donors, and
other agencies to appropriately target resources. We outline a series of research priorities and methodologies
that were drawn from an expert panel to address global priorities for MHM in schools for the next 10 years.
Conclusions: A strong evidence base for different settings, standardized definitions regarding MHM
outcomes, improved study designs and methodologies, and the creation of an MHM research consortia to
focus attention on this neglected global issue.

Introduction
Young persons aged 10�24 years represent a quarter
of the world’s population, with 90% living in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs); of these, 500 million
are girls aged 10�19 years living in less-developed
countries (1). Adolescence is a critical time of psychological
and biological change, and there is strong recognition of
the disproportionate sexual and reproductive health (SRH)
harms placed on adolescent girls in LMICs (2�4). Evidence
of a positive association between girls’ education, health,
and economic potential has strengthened international
resolve to improve educational opportunities for adoles-
cent girls (5, 6). One challenge adolescent girls face in
school in LMICs is managing their menstruation amid
other pubertal changes (7).
Despite recent momentum and a codified definition of
what menstrual hygiene management (MHM) necessi-
tates (see Box 1), a lack of adequate guidance on MHM;
poor quality and an inadequate supply of water, disposal
facilities, and privacy for changing in many schools con-
tinue to leave girls with limited options for safe and proper
personal hygiene (8�14). In addition, a lack of adequate
sanitary hygiene products forces some girls to use
unhygienic materials (11, 13, 15, 16), potentially increas-
ing urogenital symptoms and infections (17). New but
limited evidence suggests that this need leads adolescent

 girls to engage in transactional sex in order to buy
menstrual products (18, 19). Moreover, inadequate social
support, ongoing gender inequality, and social and
hygiene taboos around menstruation in numerous coun-
tries leave girls experiencing shame, fear, and confu-
sion when trying to cope with their menstrual flow (9�15,
20, 21). In addition to stripping girls of their self-esteem
and sense of agency, growing evidence suggests that in-
equitable school environments negatively impact girls’
ability to succeed academically, limit their long-term
economic potential, and significantly affect their SRH
outcomes (5, 6, 11, 13, 14, 20�23). While there is ack-
nowledgement that poor MHM is a neglected social issue
preventing girls from managing their menstruation with
safety, dignity, and privacy, research on its effect on girls’
lives remains limited (7, 24).
In recognition of the need to improve the experience of
MHM for girls in LMICs, researchers and practitioners
met to outline a global vision for MHM in schools by
2024 and identified priority action areas to guide global,
national, and local action (7). This article focuses on one
of those priorities: the need for a strong cross-sectoral
evidence base for MHM in schools for effective policies,
resource allocation, and programming at scale to ame-
liorate MHM as a socially neglected issue. The lack of
evidence continues to be a major impediment to progress,
with a lack of data contextualizing the contribution good
MHM can make to improving girls’ lives. This hampers
the ability of governments, donors, and others to pri-
oritize and appropriately target resources (7). Here, we
outline the critical research topics that were identified as
global necessities for MHM for the next 10 years and
discuss the methodological implications to close the gaps
in the existing MHM in schools’ evidence base.
The need for a strong evidence base
MHM-related research in LMICs has primarily focused
on describing the challenges and barriers associated with
MHM among schoolgirls, in limited cultural and geo-
graphical settings, with early initiatives examining the
effect of potential interventions (15, 25, 26). Given the
dearth of information on MHM globally, the expected
sensitivities around the topic, and the lack of standardized
tools and methods, research has predominantly provided
evidence from qualitative, participatory, and descriptive
methods. While this has built a foundation for action
to counter girls’ unmet MHM-related needs (9), a com-
mensurate number of analytical studies have not been
performed (27).
There are a number of priority research areas that
have been identified as essential for shaping and promot-
ing MHM in schools. Advancing the evidence on these
topics will enable the global community to better under-
stand the main negative effects of poor MHM on girls’
well-being, dignity, health, and schooling. This includes
strengthening the body of knowledge around MHM’s
impact on school dropout, absence, and other measure-
able school indicators (such as stress, self-confidence, and
self-efficacy). Efforts to specifically explore the impact of
poor MHM on girls’ SRH are also needed to define its
contribution toward sexual exposure (18, 19), and sub-
sequent increased riskof schoolgirl pregnancies and sexually
transmitted infections (23). Laboratory-based support
is required given the limited predictability of girls’ (and
women’s) reported symptomatology (17, 23, 28). There
is also a need to design good and innovative MHM
interventions (individually or as a package) for different
settings, to evaluate their impact on different outcomes
and to measure their sustainability and cost-effectiveness.
The existing MHM evidence to date, which is compre-
hensive in terms of the barriers facing girls in school
across many LMICs, thus provides little verification of
critical outcomes affecting girls’ lives and has not fully
addressed why MHM remains a neglected issue. While
inequitable school environments have been shown to dis-
advantage girls and increase the risk of pregnancy and
dropout (29, 30), evidence of the MHM-specific effects
are unknown (27). Ascertainment of intermediate out-
comes such as school absence (i.e. which may contribute
to dropout or failure to achieve) has been mixed (14, 31),
with no strong impact shown after provision of menstrual
products (15, 32). No studies have been conducted on
girls’ level of attainment in school (27). A sole focus
on school misses exploration of important health effects
on girls’ SRH and wider effects on girls’ life chances;
while pilot studies have explored this (33), verification
through larger trials is required. As well as the effect of
transactional sex for menstrual products (18, 19), the
potential for unintended pregnancy due to a lack of girls’
understanding between the menstrual cycle and fertility
has been documented (34), but not studied further.
The topic areas shown in Table 1 are exemplars iden-
tified by researchers and practitioners as having critical
gaps in knowledge around MHM for adolescent girls (7).
Addressing these research topics in multiple sites is
essential to understand the breadth and depth of MHM
needs as well as to highlight cultural differences in MHM
that are critical to intervention roll-out and adoption.
Box 1. Joint Monitoring Programme of WHO/UNICEF
Definition of Adequate MHM (35)
Women and adolescent girls are using a clean
menstrual management material to absorb or collect
menstrual blood, that can be changed in privacy as
often as necessary for the duration of a menstrual
period, using soap and water for washing the body
as required, and having access to facilities to dispose
of used menstrual management materials.

 The need for standardized definitions and
measures
While MHM has been defined, universal agreement is
needed for outcome measures, including targets that
indicate successful implementation and endpoints that
require laboratory confirmation. Below are a number of
outcome measures identified to be important that, to date,
have either been examined with variation in their defini-
tion, precision, and reliability, or have been neglected
(Table 2). Others listed have not yet been measured
in association with MHM. Predictors are sub-grouped
by main effect topic. Standard definitions have been

 developed by the Joint Monitoring Programme (Box 1);
yet, a wide range of definitions of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ MHM
have been used. In order for a robust MHM evidence base
that allows for cross-study comparisons, standardized
outcome endpoints will prove to be key.
The need for standardized study methodologies
While the priority topics listed above may include
methodological components, Table 3 specifically high-
light study methodologies that need to be considered
in future research designs A wider range of approaches
also need to be employed to capture social and cultural
factors that influence implementation. Certification of
researchers in good clinical practice (i.e. global health
training centre: https://globalhealthtrainingcentre.tghn.
org/elearning/) and research in human participants
(i.e. NIH training: https://phrp.nihtraining.com/users/
login.php) are required to ensure ethical practice (across
all studies, not specifically trials), and to encourage study
rigor. These methodologies will require adherence to
standardized guidelines and protocols, such as PRISMA
(36), STROBE (37), and CONSORT (38). This will in
turn strengthen the existing evidence base motivating
increased investment and allowing for measurement of
impact.
Inadequate funding for MHM research has been a key
factor contributing to many of the methodological issues
within existing studies and the limited quantification of
MHM in schools. Support is needed to strengthen the
MHM study methodologies that have been applied as
well as those that have not been undertaken to date. This
is critical to ensure that future studies, including impact
assessments and those that attempt to quantify outcomes,
have adequate sample sizes, and that individual partici-
pants are followed up (as the unit of measurement), with
loss to follow-up taken into account.
The need for an MHM research consortia
To further facilitate the research agenda, a multi-
disciplinary, cross-sectoral, and cross-cultural research
consortia panel is required to foster high-quality research
studies on priority topics to generate key findings rele-
vant for global policy. An important component of
the research agenda will be to provide a conduit for
strengthening and supporting research quality through
the sharing of methodologies and tools, and developing

 standard measurement criteria. The latter will allow com-
parison and pooling of findings across studies for meta-
analyses, as well as contributing toward global north�south
learning and capacity building. Envisaged functions of a
research consortia are presented in Table 4.
Such a consortia once in situ will offer an opportunity
for funders to pool resources and establish a funding
mechanism through the consortia peer-review research
panel. Seed money would be needed in the first instance to
develop the research network infrastructure, consortia
terms of reference, objectives, milestones, timeframes, work
packages, funding mechanisms and accountability system,
communication strategies, and to initiate the design and
provision of guidelines for researchers. Ultimately, we
expect that this collaborative effort will facilitate the
generation of local and global evidence-based findings
that can be translated into policies and programs globally
to promote MHM and improve adolescent girls’ dignity,
health, well-being, and schooling, and enable girls to reach
their full potential.
Table 3. Study methodologies to be considered in future research designs
Study design
Methodological components
Intervention trials
Large-scale and multi-site trials which follow CONSORT guidelines (http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-
statement/checklist) (37) are needed to quantify the impact of MHM interventions in different cultures and
settings (e.g. MHM products; WASH infrastructure; psychosocial information/education/communication
materials; programs and program implementation).
Observational methods This includes cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies, which should follow STROBE guidelines (http://
www.strobe-statement.org/) (36). Longitudinal studies that are able to follow individuals over time are needed to
assess the impact of MHM on health, educational, and economic outcomes over the life-course.
Participatory methods
In addition to typical qualitative methodologies (focus groups, in-depth and key informant interviews),
participatory approaches are needed to increase engagement of girls, other beneficiaries, and stakeholders in
planning MHM programs (i.e. participatory rural appraisal); these should follow COREQ guidelines. (http://
intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/6/349)
Multi-disciplinary/
mixed methods
Studies that generate health, social, and economic indicators, and examine inferences for program delivery.
Systematic reviews
and meta-analysis
Reviews, following PRISMA guidelines (http://www.prisma-statement.org/) (35), are needed to confirm or refute
findings from a range of prevalence and intervention studies across populations, and thus guide policy and best
practice.
Operational research
Operational research is needed to understand how national governments are implementing MHM-friendly
policies at scale, so that translation of policy into practice can be improved and these experiences can be
leveraged elsewhere.
Natural experiments
Natural experiments provide an opportunity to evaluate the impact of national-level MHM-related policies or
programs, like a new school-health policy that embraces MHM, a curricula change, or a nationwide campaign.

 Conclusions
This brief article represents a consensus by engaged ex-
perts from a range of disciplines, on the priority of MHM
in schools’ research topics and methods that need to be
explored in order to fill the gaps in the existing MHM
evidence base. This collective effort aims to improve the
quality and focus of research, enhance effectiveness of
programming, strengthen global commitment, increase
funding, facilitate sharing of expertise across disciplines to
foster multi-disciplinary studies (including intervention
research), and eliminate time and money spent on dupli-
cation of efforts in topic areas already well researched.
We advocate for the creation of a global MHM research
network through a research consortia that will help sup-
port the development of research guidelines, strengthen
translation of evidence-based research into policy, and
facilitate funding. Ultimately, while great advances have
been made in the MHM research evidence base to date,
there remain a number of important gaps in our collective
knowledge. Filling these gaps will require new research
studies that use an expanded range of methodologies, that
enable the global community to better understand the
magnitude of the problem surrounding MHM for adoles-
cent girls (in and out of school), the impact of MHM
interventions, and the costs incurred to implement them
effectively. Without broadening the existing evidence-
based knowledge, opportunities to improve an essential
component of adolescent lives will remain limited.

Paper context
There is a dearth of data measuring the effects of girls’
menses on health and well-being in low-and middle-income
countries. This lack of research has been identified as one of
the five top priorities for advancing good menstrual hygiene
management (MHM) globally. This article highlights the
existing gaps in MHM research and identifies opportunities
to build hard evidence and improve the ability of govern-
ments, donors, and other agencies to appropriately target
resources to support MHM.
