Objective. Effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fatigue are limited. We tested the effect of a pedometer-
based intervention on increasing physical activity and decreasing fatigue among individuals with RA.
Methods. Participants completed baseline questionnaires; had 1 week of activity monitoring; were randomized to con-
trol (education [EDUC]), pedometer and step-monitoring diary (PED), or pedometer and diary plus step targets (PED+)
groups, and were followed for 21 weeks. At week 10, questionnaires were administered by phone to all participants.
During the final week, all participants again had 1 week of activity monitoring. Primary outcomes were changes in
average weekly steps and fatigue (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 7-item questionnaire)
from baseline to week 21. Secondary outcomes were self-reported disease activity, physical function, pain interference,
and depressive symptoms. Changes in steps were tested using a linear mixed model. Changes in fatigue were tested
with repeated-measures models, including baseline, week-10, and week-21 scores.
Results. A total of 96 individuals participated. Eight did not complete the 21-week assessments. Both intervention
groups significantly increased steps (+1,441 [P = 0.004] for PED and +1,656 [P = 0.001] for PED+), and the EDUC group
decreased steps (-747 [P = 0.14]) (group-by-time interaction P = 0.0025). Between-group changes in fatigue were not sig-
nificantly different (interaction P = 0.21). Mean changes in fatigue scores from baseline to week 21 were -1.6 (with-
group P = 0.26), -3.2 (P = 0.02), and -4.8 (P = 0.0002) for EDUC, PED, and PED+ groups, respectively. Function and
self-reported disease activity also improved in the PED and PED+ groups.
Conclusion. Provision of pedometers, with and without providing step targets, was successful in increasing activity
levels and decreasing fatigue in this sample of individuals with RA.
INTRODUCTION
Fatigue can have a significant impact on quality of life
and functioning of people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
(1,2). However, effective treatments for fatigue are lim-
ited. RA medications seem to have minimal effects on
reducing fatigue (3–5). Programs such as cognitive behav-
ioral therapy appear to have a positive impact (6), but
the likelihood of such programs becoming widely avail-
able is unknown because of resource requirements.
Our recent study of the sources of fatigue identified
physical inactivity as a primary independent predictor of
fatigue (7), a relationship also noted by others (8,9). We
also found, similar to other published studies, that many
individuals with RA have very low levels of physical
activity (10,11) in spite of the demonstrated safety of exer-
cise and published guidelines recommending physical
activity for persons with RA (12). Although studies have
examined the impact of exercise interventions on RA out-
comes, most have focused on pain or function (13–17).
Two recent systematic reviews found that physical activ-
ity did have beneficial effects on fatigue (18,19), but most
exercise
interventions
have
been
resource
intensive,
requiring specially trained personnel, highly structured
activities, and/or attendance at classes or a specified facil-
ity. Each of these components increases cost and barriers
to implementation. Recently tested exercise interventions
specifically targeting RA fatigue have shown promising
effects (20,21), but are also unlikely to be widely imple-
mented because of resource requirements.
In contrast to more complex interventions, pedometers
are a simple but effective means of increasing physical activ-
ity (22). Studies attempting to increase activity among older
adults using pedometers and step-monitoring diaries have
found that the devices are easily used and that compliance
with pedometer and diary use is good (22,23). We devel-
oped a simple, pedometer-based intervention to test the
ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01874977.

 effect of increasing physical activity on fatigue among indi-
viduals with RA. The trial included a control group and 2
intervention groups, both of which received pedometers
and daily step-monitoring diaries, but with different levels
of guidance, and addressed the following hypotheses: 1)
individuals receiving individualized step-count goals plus a
pedometer and a step-monitoring diary will demonstrate
greater increases in physical activity than those receiving
the pedometer and diary without step targets; both of these
groups will demonstrate greater increases in physical activ-
ity than the control group, and 2) individuals receiving step-
count goals plus a pedometer and step-monitoring diary will
demonstrate greater decreases in fatigue than those receiv-
ing the pedometer and diary without step targets; both of
these groups will demonstrate greater decreases in fatigue
than the control group.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Subjects. Participants were recruited from individuals
who had participated in previous studies and were from
University
of
California,
San
Francisco
rheumatology
clinics. Recruitment occurred between November 2013 and
January 2015. Followup visits continued through June
2015. The recruitment goal was 132 participants with 120
completing
the
study
(90%
retention),
which
was
calculated to yield ≥80% power to detect a small change in
fatigue. Inclusion criteria were physician-diagnosed RA,
English- or Spanish-speaking, able to attend 3 in-person
research visits, and presence of greater than minimal
fatigue. The PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome Measure-
ment Information System [https://www.assessmentcenter.
net]) Fatigue Short Form 7a, plus 5 additional items from a
fatigue item bank were administered, with a potential raw
score range of 0–48. A score ≥18 was required for study
eligibility.
Exclusion criteria were body mass index (BMI) <20 kg/
m2, currently engaging in regular exercise, and nonambula-
tory or presence of a condition that would limit the ability
to walk (e.g., foot deformities, lower-extremity joint surgery
upcoming or in past 6 months, myocardial infarction in
past 6 months, stroke, congestive heart failure, or severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Use of walking
aids was permitted. Once eligibility was confirmed, indi-
viduals were scheduled for in-person baseline study visits.
Procedures. At the baseline visit, staff obtained signed
consent, administered questionnaires, and measured height
and weight. A second in-person visit was scheduled for 1
week later, and all participants were given an activity
monitor to wear for the intervening week. Participants were
instructed to wear the activity monitor day and night except
when showering, bathing, or swimming.
At the second visit, activity monitors were collected and
subjects were randomly assigned to an intervention arm.
For randomization, sealed envelopes were prepared with
group assignments in blocks of random size. Envelopes
were numbered and opened sequentially at the time of the
second visit. Once the group assignment was revealed,
study staff reviewed the specific procedures for that group.
Study groups. Education only (EDUC). The EDUC group
received an educational brochure (Be Active Your Way:
A Guide for Adults [http://health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/
paguide.pdf]) and a guided discussion of simple ways to
increase physical activity in daily life based on the booklet.
The brochure was available in English and Spanish.
Pedometer only (PED). The PED group received the
educational booklet and discussion, plus a pedometer and
a diary to record daily step counts from the pedometer.
Participants were shown how to wear the pedometer, and
were instructed to wear it from the time they got out of bed
in the morning until they went to bed at night, except
while showering, bathing, or swimming. The step diary
was prepopulated with dates and provided spaces to record
each day’s steps and notes about other activities, problems
with the activity monitor, injuries, or other relevant issues.
Pedometer + step
targets
(PED+). The
PED+
group
received
the
educational
booklet
and
discussion,
the
pedometer and step diary, and individualized daily step
targets. Step targets were based on the week of activity
monitoring between the baseline and randomization visits,
and were calculated to increase participants’ average daily step
counts by 10% for every 2 weeks of the intervention period.
Pedometers. The Jawbone Up pedometer was used for
the baseline and final week of monitoring for all groups.
This device does not have a visual display, which could
have influenced activity levels (24). The Fitbit Zip was
chosen for the intervention groups (PED and PED+ only)
because it has a simple visual display, is relatively easy
to wear and operate, and does not require connection
with a smart phone for use. The online features of the
Fitbit Zip were disabled during the study period.
Significance & Innovations
• Although fatigue can have a significant impact on
quality of life for individuals with rheumatoid arthri-
tis, effective and feasible treatments are limited.
• We tested the impact of a simple, pedometer-based
intervention on physical activity and fatigue. The
trial included a control group and 2 intervention
groups, both of which received pedometers and
daily step-monitoring diaries, but with different
levels of guidance.
• Both intervention groups significantly increased
activity levels from baseline to final measure-
ment, with little difference in increases between
the 2 groups, while the control group’s average
daily steps declined.
• Both intervention groups significantly decreased
fatigue levels, as well as showing improvements
in physical function and self-reported disease
activity. In contrast, there was no significant
change in fatigue, or in the secondary outcomes
of physical function or disease activity in the
control group.

 Followup. The PED and PED+ groups were contacted
by phone every 2 weeks to collect recorded step counts.
Participants were given the option of reporting by text or
e-mail if they preferred. At each 2-week followup, the
PED+ group’s average daily steps were compared with
the target assigned for that period. If individuals met
their target, a new step target was calculated to increase
steps by 10% from the previous target. If individuals did
not meet the target, the existing target remained in place.
All participants were contacted by phone at week 10
for administration of an abbreviated set of question-
naires. At week 19, the Jawbone Up device was sent out
for a final week of monitoring during week 20. At week
21, all participants returned for an in-person visit during
which study staff collected the Jawbone Up device and
final weeks of step diaries (PED and PED+ groups only),
administered questionnaires, and collected participant
comments about the study. All study procedures and
materials
were
approved
by
the
UCSF
Institutional
Review Board.
Variables. Primary outcome: weekly average number
of daily steps. Steps from the Jawbone Up were chosen a
priori to assess baseline and final followup activity
levels. Steps were aggregated to determine average daily
steps over the 2 1-week periods.
Supplemental analyses used the weekly average num-
ber of steps across the entire intervention period for PED
and PED+ groups from the Fitbits, recorded in the step
diaries. If subjects engaged in physical activities such as
swimming or cycling as well as walking, they were
instructed to record these activities in their diaries. Nine
subjects in the PED group and 6 in the PED+ group
reported other activities, including stationary bike riding,
swimming, Pilates, and yoga. Using published conver-
sions of time (25) spent in these activities to step counts,
daily step counts were adjusted to account for time in
activities other than walking.
Primary outcome: fatigue. Fatigue was measured with
the PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 7a questionnaire. To
score, raw scores were converted to standardized T scores,
with a population mean � SD of 50 � 10 (26). Higher
scores on the PROMIS fatigue scale reflect greater fatigue.
Secondary outcomes. RA disease activity was measured
with
the
Rheumatoid
Arthritis Disease Activity
Index
(RADAI), which includes self-reports of joint pain, swelling,
Figure 1. Study enrollment and retention. RA = rheumatoid arthritis.

 morning stiffness, and global impact (27). RADAI scores
range from 0 to 10, with higher scores reflecting greater
activity. Functional impairment was assessed with the
Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (28). HAQ scores
range from 0 to 3, with higher scores reflecting worse
function. Pain was measured with the 6-item PROMIS pain
interference questionnaire (29). Higher scores indicate greater
impact of pain on daily activities. Depressive symptoms were
assessed with the 8-item version of the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-8) (30). PHQ-8 items are based on
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
depression criteria. Higher scores reflect greater levels of
depressive symptoms.
Other
variables. Sociodemographic
information
(age,
duration of RA, race/ethnicity, education, household income,
and work status), smoking history, and RA medications were
obtained through self-report. BMI was calculated from
measured height and weight. Adherence for the PED and
PED+ groups was estimated by the proportion of study days
for which steps were recorded in the diaries.
Statistical
analysis. Group
differences
in
baseline
characteristics were assessed with chi-square analyses and
analyses of variance. To test changes in steps measured by
Jawbone Up for all 3 groups, a linear mixed model was fit.
This model included random intercepts and tested the
group-by-time interaction, as well as within-group changes.
For the PED and PED+ groups, a linear repeated-mea-
sures model was also fit to examine weekly step counts
across the entire intervention period. Time was modeled
as a continuous variable and the group-by-time interac-
tion was estimated. The model included Jawbone Up
steps at baseline as a covariate, random intercepts, ran-
dom slopes, their covariation, and first-order, auto-regres-
sive residuals.
Changes in fatigue scores were tested with repeated-
measures models, including baseline, week-10, and week-

 21 scores. This model tested the group-by-time interaction
across all 3 groups. Time was modeled as a categorical
variable, and the models included random intercepts and
an auto-regressive residual. The secondary outcomes of
PHQ-8, pain interference, HAQ, and RADAI scores were
modeled in the same fashion, although HAQ was collected
only at baseline and week 21. Models yielded both omni-
bus group-by-time interactions as well as simple interac-
tions. Using fatigue scores as an example, the omnibus
interaction would be based on the 3 groups and a 3-level
indicator of time (baseline, week 10, and week 21), and
would have 4 df. Such interactions can be difficult to
interpret, so to ease interpretation, we also constructed
corresponding “simple” interaction terms that each repre-
sent a single df. Each simple interaction compared the
baseline versus 21-week change across pairs of study
groups (e.g., EDUC versus PED).
All models were fit to all available data within the lin-
ear
mixed
models
framework,
which
invoked
the
assumption that data values were missing at random,
conditional on the observed modeled data.
We also compared the proportion of participants in each
group who were sedentary (<5,000 steps/day [31]) and
achieved healthy levels of activity (≥8,000 steps/day [31]) at
baseline and week 21. A minimally important change
(MIC) in daily steps has not been established. However,
changes equivalent to 0.5 SD have been shown to approxi-
mate an MIC (32). Evidence also suggests that increases in
average daily steps ≥2,800 are associated with significant
health benefits (33,34). We compared the proportion in
each group who met each of these criteria. We also exam-
ined the proportion of individuals in each group who
achieved an MIC in fatigue. An MIC on the PROMIS fatigue
questionnaire has not been identified for individuals with
RA. However, in a population of cancer patients, Yost et al
identified a potential MIC range of 3–5 points for the PRO-
MIS fatigue scale scored on a T score scale (35). We chose
the midpoint of that range, and defined an MIC as 4 points.
RESULTS
Participation. A total of 359 individuals were approached
to participate in the study (Figure 1). Ninety-one refused
prior to determining eligibility. Of the remaining 268,
a total of 150 were ineligible. Twenty-two refused par-
ticipation after determining eligibility, leaving 96 parti-
cipants. Eight participants (8.3%) dropped out prior to
completing the 21-week assessment. Dropouts were signifi-
cantly older than participants who remained in the study
(63.3 years versus 53.6 years; P = 0.03). There were no other
significant differences on any of the measured variables
between individuals who dropped out and those who
completed the study.
Baseline characteristics. Baseline characteristics of the
participants are shown in Table 1. Mean participant age
was 54 years, 88% were female, 64% were white, and 22%
were Spanish-speaking. The EDUC group was significantly
older and had a longer duration of RA. There were no other
significant differences among the groups.
Mean daily steps from the baseline week of monitoring
were 4,891, with a range of 405 to over 15,000. Fifty-six
percent of the sample could be classified as sedentary
(i.e., mean daily baseline steps <5,000 [31]); only 14%
averaged daily step counts sufficient to accrue health ben-
efits (≥8,000 steps/day [31]). Mean � SD baseline PROMIS

 fatigue T score was 59.3 � 6.7, almost 1 SD above the
population mean.
Primary outcomes. Steps: primary (Jawbone, baseline,
and week 21 only, all participants). Both intervention
groups significantly increased step counts (mean change
+1,441 [P = 0.004] for PED and mean change +1,656 [P =
0.001] for PED+) (Table 2), whereas the EDUC group de-
creased steps (mean change �747 [P = 0.14]). Changes within
both intervention groups significantly differed from those in
the EDUC group (P = 0.0025 for omnibus group-by-time
interaction effect; P = 0.003 for simple group-by-time
interaction effects: PED versus EDUC; and P = 0.002 for
PED+ versus EDUC). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to
adjust for differences in age and disease duration among the
3 groups; no substantive differences in results were found.
At baseline, 50%, 64%, and 53% of EDUC, PED, and
PED+ groups, respectively, could be classified as seden-
tary (<5,000 steps/day), and relatively small proportions
were achieving healthy activity levels (≥8,000 steps/day)
(Figure 2). At week 21, 70% of the EDUC group were
classified as sedentary, compared to 43% of the PED
group and 36% of the PED+ group (P = 0.04). The pro-
portion of the EDUC group achieving a healthy activity
level remained around 20%, while the proportions of the
PED and PED+ groups achieving health activity doubled
(from 9% to 17% for PED and from 15% to 32% for
PED+), although group differences in these proportions
were not statistically significant. Nine percent of the
EDUC group increased steps by 0.5 SD, compared to
33% of the PED group and 48% of the PED+ group (P =
0.008), and 9% of the EDUC group increased by ≥2,800
steps, compared to 30% of the PED group and 29% of
the PED+ group (P = 0.14).
Supplemental (Fitbit + diary weekly step counts, PED
and PED+ groups only). The average daily steps from
the initial Fitbit week of monitoring were similar for the
PED and PED+ groups (5,629 for PED; 5,455 for PED+).
The general slope for the PED+ group was positive,
averaging an increase of about 22 steps per week (P =
0.27), whereas the slope was negative for the PED group,
averaging a decline of about 37 steps per week (P = 0.08).

Figure 2. Summary of baseline and followup sedentary and healthy activity levels, changes in activity, and decreases in fatigue. Seden-
tary activity defined as mean daily steps/day <5,000 (31). Healthy activity level defined as mean daily steps/day ≥8,000 (31). An
increase of ≥2,800 mean daily steps/day is associated with reduction of health risk (33,34). An increase of ≥1,608 mean daily steps/day
(0.5 of baseline SD) approximates a minimally important change (MIC) (32). A decrease in the PROMIS fatigue T score of 4 points
approximates an MIC (35).

 The differences in the 2 slopes represented a significant
group-by-time interaction effect (P = 0.04) (Figure 3).
Fatigue. Mean changes in PROMIS fatigue scores from
baseline to week 21 were -1.6, -3.2, and -4.8 for EDUC, PED,
and PED+ groups, respectively (Table 2). Within-group
changes for PED and PED+ groups were statistically sig-
nificant (P = 0.02 and P = 0.0002, respectively). The repeated-
measures analysis omnibus group-by-time interaction
effect was not statistically significant (P = 0.21). However,
simple tests of interaction indicated a statistical trend for
the PED+ group to reduce fatigue scores by 3.2 points more
than the EDUC group by 21 weeks (P = 0.09). Sensitivity
analyses were conducted to adjust for differences in age
and disease duration among the 3 groups; no substantive
differences in results were found.
Assuming a 4-point MIC, 43%, 56%, and 53% of indi-
viduals in the EDUC, PED, and PED+ groups, respectively,
achieved an important decline in fatigue (P = 0.57)
(Figure 2). The mean change within the PED+ group met
the MIC criterion at 21 weeks.
Adherence. Overall, steps were recorded on 88.8% of
study days (92.6% for PED and 85.1% for PED+). There
were no significant differences in changes in steps or
fatigue for individuals with <80% adherence versus
≥80%, or <90% adherence versus ≥90%.
Adverse events. Interviewers asked about “problems”
at each contact (every 2 weeks for PED and PED+ groups;
at 10 and 21 weeks for the EDUC group). One participant
(PED group) reported a calf muscle strain at day 5 and
decreased
activity
for
a
short
period
of
time,
but
continued to monitor steps and completed the study. No
other adverse effects were reported that were attributed
to the intervention.
Secondary outcomes. The EDUC group’s RADAI in-
creased significantly from baseline to week 10, with little
change between weeks 10 and 21 (Table 3). In contrast,
RADAI scores for the PED and PED+ groups were relatively
stable between baseline and week 10, and then decreased
significantly between week 10 and week 21. The omnibus
interaction effect was not significant (P = 0.17), but the
simple interactions contrasting changes in RADAI between
each intervention group versus the EDUC group were
significant at 21 weeks (P < 0.05).
HAQ scores remained constant for the EDUC group,
but scores within the PED and PED+ groups improved
significantly (�0.18 [P = 0.04] for PED and �0.26 [P =
0.002] for PED+). The decrease in HAQ for the PED+
group met the minimal clinically important difference
criterion (~0.22) (36). The omnibus test of the interaction
effect was marginally significant (P = 0.09), but the sim-
ple interaction comparing PED+ versus EDUC suggested
significantly greater improvement in the PED+ group by
21 weeks (P = 0.03).
For both PROMIS pain interference and PHQ-8, there
was general improvement for all groups (main effect of
time P < 0.0001). Within-group analyses showed statisti-
cally significant improvements for the PED and PED+
groups; corresponding improvements within the EDUC
group were marginal. There were no significant group-
by-time interactions.
Figure 3. Fitbit steps over the study period. Significant group-by-time interaction (P = 0.046). The pedometer and diary plus step tar-
gets group (PED+) slope = 21.5; the pedometer and step-monitoring diary group (PED) slope = �36.7. The PED + group gained about 21
steps/week on average, while the PED group decreased by about 37 steps/week. The PED+ group gained a step advantage of approxi-
mately 58 steps/week.
Walking Intervention for RA Fatigue

 DISCUSSION
Both intervention groups significantly increased Jaw-
bone-recorded activity levels from baseline to final mea-
surement, with little difference in increases between the
2 groups. In contrast, the EDUC group’s average daily
steps declined. Initially, activity levels were low in the
study cohort, with average daily steps ~5,000, and half of
participants with average daily steps under 4,000. For
context, <5,000 steps per day is considered sedentary
and associated with health risk (31,37). Changes in activ-
ity levels for the 2 intervention groups were meaningful:
there was a >30% decrease in the proportion of people
classified as sedentary, and the number of individuals
who met the criterion for a healthy level of activity
(≥8,000 steps/day) doubled.
Although overall changes in fatigue scores were not sig-
nificantly different between groups, both intervention
groups significantly decreased fatigue levels. In contrast,
there was no significant change in fatigue in the EDUC
group. The average decrease in fatigue for the PED+ group
at 21 weeks met the defined MIC criterion, suggesting a
meaningful decrease in fatigue for this group.
The intervention also positively affected secondary out-
comes. HAQ scores, self-reported disease activity, and pain
interference significantly decreased from baseline to 21
weeks in the pedometer groups. Comparable changes were
not seen in the EDUC group. In the past, there was concern

Katz et al
 that physical activity or exercise might exacerbate RA
symptoms. Our findings are similar to previous reports that
exercise did not lead to worsened RA. This is particularly
important in light of the unsupervised and unguided nature
of our intervention.
Depressive symptoms significantly decreased in the inter-
vention groups. Exercise has been established as an effective
treatment for depression in general population studies.
Depression rates are elevated in RA, so confirming that phys-
ical activity has a positive effect on depression in RA could
open a potentially important new intervention strategy.
The baseline and final week of monitoring with the Jaw-
bone Up device, defined as the primary outcome measure,
indicated an increase in activity levels in both interven-
tion groups, while the weekly monitoring with the Fitbit
Zip suggested a decreasing trend during the intervention
period for the PED group (Figure 3). It appeared that the
PED group started the intervention with a large increase in
steps from baseline to the first week (from an average of
4,223 at baseline to 5,629 at week 1, an increase of 1,406
steps), while the PED+ group’s increase from baseline to
week 1 was smaller (from 5,019 to 5,455, an increase of
436 steps). The more gradual increase of the PED+ group,
guided by targets, may have led to greater adherence over
time. It is also possible that the larger initial increase in
the PED group led to higher levels of fatigue or symptoms
that discouraged continued increases in activity. We can-
not directly compare the output of the baseline and weekly
monitoring because different devices were used, so this
phenomenon deserves further attention in future studies.
Some studies have shown that providing incremental tar-
gets is more effective in increasing step counts than provid-
ing a pedometer alone (38,39). We did not find clear
evidence that this was the case. It is possible that for certain
individuals, targets may be more effective, and, as noted
above, guidance for more incremental increases may
increase adherence over time. More research is needed both
to determine the most effective means of delivering the
intervention, and to identify individuals who may need the
additional support or motivation of targets.
This study has limitations. First, the sample size limited
our ability to measure differences among groups. However,
the results were encouraging with significant within-group
changes in both activity and fatigue for the intervention
groups, and provide support for a larger trial. It was not
possible to determine the intensity of activity (e.g., speed of
walking) from the devices used. Some studies have shown
that higher intensity activities have greater benefits, partic-
ularly for depression. These devices also did not provide
actual wear time as some activity monitors do, so our mea-
sure of adherence can only be considered an estimate.
However, the commercially available intervention devices
were simple to use and are readily available, and our study
demonstrates the value of monitoring alone. We experi-
enced technical difficulties with monitoring devices, such
as device failure and subjects forgetting to wear the devices.
These difficulties are likely to happen in any similar inter-
vention, but they also create missing data that can affect
both study power and analyses. There is also error in the
measurement of activity by these devices (40). It is likely
that
regular
contact
with
study
personnel
affected
adherence, even though staff attempted to maintain neutral
reactions when they collected data at the 2-week phone
check-ins. Future studies might attempt to quantify the
effect of this type of social interaction.
In summary, provision of pedometers, with and with-
out providing guidance in the form of step targets, was
successful in increasing activity levels in these individu-
als with RA. While decreases in fatigue were not statisti-
cally different across groups, fatigue did significantly
decrease in both pedometer groups, with over 50%
reporting clinically important decreases in fatigue. Sig-
nificant
improvements
in
other
outcomes
were
also
noted for the 2 pedometer groups. Our results provide
evidence that pedometers are effective at increasing
physical activity among people with RA, and provide
support for the hypothesis that increasing physical activ-
ity by walking has important effects on fatigue and other
RA symptoms.
