Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disease
eventually leading to dementia. An effective treatment does not
yet exist. Here we show that oral application of the compound
anle138b
restores
hippocampal
synaptic
and
transcriptional
plasticity as well as spatial memory in a mouse model for Alzhei-
mer’s disease, when given orally before or after the onset of
pathology. At the mechanistic level, we provide evidence that
anle138b blocks the activity of conducting Ab pores without chang-
ing the membrane embedded Ab-oligomer structure. In conclusion,
our data suggest that anle138b is a novel and promising compound
to treat AD-related pathology that should be investigated further.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative
disorder causing a severe emotional and economic burden to our
societies. Due to increased life expectancies, the number of those
afflicted with AD is expected to double by 2025. Despite intensive
research, effective therapeutic approaches are still not available.

 The pathogenesis of AD has been linked to protein aggregation,
namely the aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides (Ab) and tau
protein. The accumulation of pathogenic aggregates of Ab peptides
in the brain appears to be a key event in the pathogenesis of AD
(Iversen et al, 1995; Tanzi, 2005; Jakob-Roetne & Jacobsen, 2009;
Goate & Hardy, 2012), and targeting amyloid pathology still repre-
sents a promising therapeutic strategy (Haass & Selkoe, 2007;
Sevigny et al, 2016). The precise molecular events that trigger
amyloid-induced decline of synaptic plasticity and neuronal cell
death are still not entirely resolved and are likely to be multifacto-
rial. One of the first explanations of neuronal dysfunction and toxic-
ity in AD is the channel hypothesis first proposed by Arispe and
coworkers (Arispe et al, 1993), which postulates that unregulated
Ab ion channels result in a loss of ionic homeostasis (primarily
through a gain of Ca2+) that eventually triggers neuronal dysfunc-
tion and cell death. In vivo evidence for this mechanism is, however,
still rare, and a compound that would block pores and be active in
mammalian animal models has not been reported yet. Thus, the
original request by Arispe and coworkers that a useful strategy for
drug discovery for treatment of AD should include screening
compounds for their ability to block or otherwise modify Ab chan-
nels is still left unsatisfied (Arispe et al, 1993).
In this work, we examine the efficacy of the diphenylpyrazole
(DPP) compound anle138b in an animal model of Ab deposition.
Oral application of anle138b ameliorates Ab-induced deficits in
synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Using in vivo and in vitro
approaches, we provide evidence that this effect is linked to the
capacity of anle138b to reduce the conductivity of Ab pores in lipid
bilayer membranes. Although other mechanisms likely contribute to
this effect, our data suggest the functional modulation of the
membrane bound Ab-oligomers as a mechanism for neuroprotection
and support the idea that anle138b should be taken into clinical
trials to treat aggregopathies, including AD.
Results
Synaptic plasticity and memory function in a mouse model
for deposition of amyloid b peptides after oral treatment
with anle138b
To initially test the potential of anle138b as therapeutic strategies to
treat amyloid aggregation in Alzheimer’s disease, we analyzed its
effect in a Drosophila model for amyloid-induced neurotoxicity. We
observed that treatment with anle138b improved survival times
when compared to a vehicle-treated group (Appendix Fig S1). On
the basis of these data, we decided to test the efficacy of anle138b in
a mouse model for amyloid deposition. We like to state that none of
the currently employed animal models for AD fully recapitulate the
phenotypes seen in AD patients, and thus, care has to be taken
when interpreting such data. In our study, we employed APPPS1D9
mice (Jankowsky et al, 2001), a well-established model for AD-
linked amyloid deposition. Since in the patients therapeutic inter-
vention is normally initiated only after the onset of amyloid plaque
formation, we decided to test anle138b in two experimental cohorts.
In the “pre-plaque group,” treatment was initiated before the onset
of pathology when mice were 2 months of age, while in the “post-
plaque group” treatment was initiated after the onset of amyloid
deposition and memory disturbances in 6-month-old mice (Fig EV1;
Jankowsky et al, 2004; Lalonde et al, 2005; Reiserer et al, 2007). In
both cohorts, anle138b was continuously provided via food pellets.
Thus, in the pre-plaque group, mice were subjected to anle138b or
placebo treatment from 2 months of age, and electrophysiological,
behavioral, and biochemical analyses were initiated at 6 months of
age. A group of wild-type mice (WT) treated with anle138b served
as an additional control. We first measured synaptic plasticity by
analyzing hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). While robust
hippocampal LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapse was observed in
WT control mice treated with anle138b (Fig 1A), LTP was signifi-
cantly impaired in APPPS1D9 mice that received placebo (Fig 1B).
Notably, this LTP deficit was completely rescued in APPPS1D9 mice
treated with anle138b (Fig 1C). These data suggest that oral applica-
tion
of
anle138b
protects
against
Ab-induced
impairment
of
hippocampal synaptic plasticity. To test whether the effect of
anle138b on hippocampal plasticity also improved hippocampus-
dependent memory function, another group of anle138b and
placebo-treated mice were subjected to the Morris water maze test,
a well-established paradigm to assay spatial memory in rodents
(Morris, 1984). Anle138b-treated WT mice displayed robust spatial
learning as indicated by decreasing escape latency throughout the
8 days of training (Fig 1D). In contrast, APPPS1D9 mice treated with
placebo showed a significantly impaired escape latency (Fig 1D).
This deficit was partially rescued in APPPS1D9 mice that received
anle138b. Spatial reference memory was analyzed in a probe test
performed after 8 days of training. While WT mice showed a
significant preference for the target quadrant, no such effect was
observed in placebo-treated APPPS1D9 mice (Fig 1E), confirming
memory impairment in APPPS1D9 mice. In contrast, anle138b-
treated APPPS1D9 mice displayed a significant preference for the
target quadrant indicating restored spatial memory (Fig 1E). Swim
speed was similar amongst the groups (Fig 1F). We also examined
if anle138b would affect basal explorative behavior (Fig 1G) or
basal anxiety (Fig 1H). No difference was found amongst the
groups suggesting that oral administration of anle138b can protect
APPPS1D9 mice from deteriorating hippocampal synaptic plasticity
and hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation.
Encouraged by these findings, we investigated whether anle138b
could also reinstate synaptic plasticity and memory function when
significant amyloid deposition had already occurred employing the
post-plaque group (Fig EV1). To this end, 6-month-old APPPS1D9
mice were treated with either anle138b or placebo for 4 months.
Wild-type mice treated with anle138b served as an additional
control group. Analysis was performed when mice were 10 months
of age. In a first cohort, we measured hippocampal LTP. WT mice
treated with anle138b showed robust LTP (Fig 2A), while LTP was
significantly impaired in placebo-treated APPPS1D9 mice (Fig 2B).
Notably, a complete restoration of hippocampal LTP was seen in
APPPS1D9 mice treated with anle138b (Fig 2C). In conclusion, simi-
lar to the pre-plaque group treatment with anle138b had a marked
ameliorating effect on LTP even after the onset of plaque deposition.
To analyze whether reinstatement of hippocampal plasticity
would also correlate with improved memory function, we subjected
mice to the Morris water maze test. WT mice treated with anle138b
rapidly learned the task as indicated by reduced escape latency
throughout the 8 days of training (Fig 2D). Placebo-treated 10-
month-old APPPS1D9 mice display impaired spatial learning as

In wild-type mice of the pre-plaque group (treated from 2 to 6 months of age with anle138b), robust LTP that lasts for at least 3 h is elicited upon a strong
tetanization (STET) (3 trains of 100 pulses at 100 Hz given 10 min apart, arrows) at the Schaffer collateral CA3-CA1 synapse (t-test, P = 0.00005; n = 16 comparing

 indicated by the escape latency that did not significantly decrease
during the training (Fig 2D). When compared to the placebo group,
APPPS1D9 mice treated with anle138b showed improved spatial
learning (Fig 2D). A probe test was performed after 8 days of train-
ing. WT mice treated with anle138b showed a significant preference
for the target quadrant indicative of intact spatial reference memory
(Fig 2E).
Placebo-treated
APPPS1D9
mice
exhibited
severely
impaired memory function (Fig 2E) and displayed no target prefer-
ence (Fig 2E). In APPPS1D9 mice treated with anle138b (Fig 2E),
target preference was improved significantly but did not reach WT
levels. Of note, swim speed was not different between the experi-
mental groups (Fig 2F). Explorative behavior (Fig 2G) and basal
anxiety (Fig 2H) were measured in the open field test. There was no
significant difference amongst groups. We also tested whether
anle138b treatment would affect memory function in wild-type mice
but did not observe any significant difference (Appendix Fig S2).
Thus, oral administration of anle138b partially restores hippocam-
pal plasticity and memory function in APPPS1D9 mice even at an
advanced stage of pathology.
Anle138b reinstate transcriptional homeostasis and ameliorates
amyloid pathology
Pathological alterations often lead to aberrant changes in transcrip-
tional plasticity indicating deregulated cellular homeostasis (Fischer,
2014a). In support of this, numerous studies demonstrated that AD
pathogenesis correlates with altered gene expression in various brain
regions (Fischer, 2014b; Benito et al, 2015; Matarin et al, 2015).
Moreover, monitoring gene expression changes can inform about
the efficacy of therapeutic intervention (Benito et al, 2015). In keep-
ing with this idea, we performed RNA sequencing from hippocampal
tissue dissected from mice in the pre- and post-plaque (Fig EV1)
cohorts. Notably, there were no differences in hippocampal gene
expression when comparing WT placebo- vs. WT anle138b-treated
mice, suggesting that anle138b has no direct effect on transcriptome
plasticity. Thus, we first compared gene expression in placebo-
treated WT and placebo-treated APPPS1DE9 mice of the pre-plaque
group. We identified 202 differentially expressed genes of which 73
were up- and 129 were down-regulated (Fig 3A; Dataset EV1). Path-
way analysis shows that down-regulated genes are linked to reduced
energy metabolism, mitochondria function, cytoskeleton integrity,
and synaptic plasticity, while pathways linked to cell growth were
increased (Fig 3B). These data are in line with previous reports of
gene expression changes in AD (Benito et al, 2015; Matarin et al,
2015) and were confirmed via qPCR (Appendix Fig S3A).
Because anle138b restored LTP and spatial memory functions in
pre-plaque mice (see Fig 1), we hypothesized that the transcriptome
of APPPS1DE9 mice treated with anle138b may more closely resem-
ble that of wild-type mice. Indeed, a wild-type-like gene expression
profile is to a large extent reinstated in anle138b-treated APPPS1DE9
and only 27 genes were deregulated when comparing wild-type
mice treated with anle138b vs. APPPS1DE9 mice treated with
anle138b groups (Fig 3A). Thus, none of the pathways deregulated
in response to amyloid pathology (Fig 3B) remained significant after
anle138b treatment. Accordingly, no enrichment for any specific
pathway could be detected. The possibility remained that anle138b
treatment may simply reduce the expression levels of the APP and
PS1 transgenes specifically in APPPS1DE9. However, the RNA-seq
data showed that APP and PS1 are increased in placebo-treated
APPPS1DE9 mice when compared to placebo-treated wild-type mice
(see Dataset EV1). Similarly, APP and PS1 transgenes were elevated
in anle138b-treated APPPS1DE9 mice compared to anle138b-treated
wild-type mice (see Dataset EV1). These data were confirmed via
qPCR showing that the expression of APP and PS1 transgenes is
similar in placebo- and anle138b-treated APPPS1DE9 mice (Fig 3C);
the gene expression data are in line with the electrophysiological
and behavioral findings. It also shows that in the pre-plaque group,
anle138b treatment reinstates cellular homeostasis in the hippocam-
pus of APPPS1DE9 mice.
We next analyzed hippocampal gene expression in the post-
plaque
group
(Fig EV1).
When
comparing
WT
placebo
and
APPPS1DE9 placebo mice, we found 130 differentially expressed
genes of which the majority (124) were up-regulated (Fig 3D), a
finding confirmed via qPCR (Appendix Fig S3A). The comparison of
anle138b-treated WT and anle138b-treated APPPS1DE9 mice revealed
220 differentially expressed genes, 207 up-regulated, and 13 down-
regulated (Fig 3D). Around half of these, 103 were also deregulated
in the comparison WT placebo vs. APPPS1DE9 placebo (Fig 3E), a
finding confirmed via qPCR (Appendix Fig S3B). Pathway analysis
revealed that gene expression changes almost exclusively represent
an induction of neuroinflammatory processes (Fig 3F) in response to
the APP and PS1 transgenes and this induction is not changed by
treatment with anle138b. These data suggest that anle138b treatment
does not have a major impact on inflammatory processes when given
at a stage of advanced amyloid pathology. Since anle138b treatment
nevertheless reinstated hippocampal synaptic plasticity and also
partially restored memory function, these findings indicate that the
therapeutic efficacy of anle138b is most likely not solely due to the
dampening of amyloid-induced inflammation.
A previous study reported that anle138b exhibits therapeutic
effect in TauP301S mice, a mouse model for Tau pathology
(Wagner et al, 2015). Taking into account that Tau and amyloid
pathology represent the two major causative factors for AD, we
wondered if anle138b would affect brain homeostasis as measured
by hippocampal gene expression also in TauP301S mice. To this
end, we obtained hippocampal brain tissue from the same experi-
ment using anle138b or vehicle-treated wild-type and TauP301S
mice as described by Wagner et al (2015). The experimental
design employed by Wagner et al is similar to our pre-plaque
group, since anle138b was feed to mice upon weaning. Similar to
our data, feeding anle138b to wild-type mice had a neglectable
effect on hippocampal gene expression when compared to vehicle
fed wild-type mice (Appendix Fig S4, Dataset EV1). The compar-
ison of vehicle-treated wild-type to vehicle-treated TauP301S mice
revealed 257 differentially expressed genes that mainly represent
increased pathways linked to neuroinflammation (Appendix Fig
S4). Of note, this gene expression signature was significantly
ameliorated in anle138b-treated TauP301S mice and only 16 genes
were
differentially
expressed
when
comparing
vehicle-
vs.
anle138b-treated TauP301S mice (Appendix Fig S4). These data
allow for a number of interesting conclusions. First, at the
hippocampal gene expression level, the overexpression of the
human Tau gene carrying the P301S mutation leads to inflamma-
tory response but in contrast to the data observed in APPPS1DE9
mice has very limited impact on the expression of genes linked to
synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Second, treatment

 with anle138b in TauP301S mice ameliorates the gene expression
changes, at least when treatment is initiated before the onset of
pathology, further confirming that treatment with anle138b helps
to reinstate hippocampal homeostasis.
Given that anle138b was shown to counter aggregation in models
for a-synuclein and prion toxicity (Wagner et al, 2013), it is likely
that at least part of the therapeutic effect observed in this study is
due to anle138b interfering with amyloid aggregation. To test this
hypothesis, we prepared brain slices for histochemical analysis. We
used thioflavin S, a common stain to quantify Ab plaques (Fig 4A).
We first assayed the amyloid plaques pathology in the hippocampus
and cortex in the pre-plaques group. Since no amyloid pathology
was detectable in WT mice, these mice served as negative control.
We observed a significant reduction in the number of plaques and
the total area covered by plaques in anle138b-treated mice (Fig 4A
and B). Similar results were obtained when we analyzed plaque
load in the post-plaques group (Fig 4B and C), although the pathol-
ogy was generally more severe in the post-plaque group. Thus, oral
administration of anle138b reduces amyloid pathology when given
before or after the onset of pathology.
Biophysical characterization of Ab in the presence of anle138b
To better understand the mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic
effect of anle138b, we analyzed its impact on Ab-induced pore
formation (Arispe et al, 1993). To this end, we employed black lipid
membranes (BLM) using a mixture of POPE and DOPS in a 1:1 ratio
or oxidized cholesterol/n-decane, an assay in which the current
passing through a membrane is a measure of membrane integrity
(Appendix Fig S5A). We first established that the conductance and
the morphology of POPE and DOPS lipids, as measured by atomic
force microscopy (AFM), lipid bilayers are not affected in the pres-
ence of anle138b or Ab peptides (Appendix Fig S6).
When we examined the effect of Ab1–42 in DOPS/POPE (1:1)
membranes, we observed a stepwise growth of bulk membrane
conductance. Such activity is indicative of the combined action of
many individual pores (Fig 5A). Pore “stacking” is likely the result of
prolonged open lifetimes and the formation and/or opening of addi-
tional conducting pores. Anle138b-doped membranes demonstrated
fewer simultaneously active pores and significantly reduced bulk
conductance (Fig 5A
and
B,
Appendix
Fig
S5)
compared
to
membranes
lacking
the
anle138b
compound
(Fig 5A
and
B,
Appendix Fig S5). Our results indicate that treatment with anle138b
alters the pore dynamics, resulting in less stable and shorter lived
“open” pores. Decreased pore stability leads to a reduction in the total
number
of
simultaneously
conducting
pores
and
significantly
decreased conductance across the membrane. AFM data revealed that
anle138b treatment did not affect the surface structure of Ab1-42 pores
(Fig EV2), suggesting that anle138b does not simply prevent Ab1-42
from entering lipid bilayer membranes and forming pores. Rather
anle138b appears to render conducting Ab pores to non-conducting
ones—likely through structural change to the membrane embedded
region of Ab1–42—thereby providing one possible mechanism by
which anle138b ameliorates LTP and learning deficits in APPPS1DE9
mice. Similar effects were observed when the conductance measure-
ments were repeated in oxidized cholesterol (Appendix Fig S5B).
To provide in vivo evidence for pore formation, we treated
primary hippocampal neurons with Ab1-40 monomers or oligomers
in the absence or presence of anle138b and assayed membrane
integrity. While the addition of Ab1-40 oligomers but not Ab1-40
monomers significantly damaged membrane integrity, this effect
was reversed by anle138b (Fig 5C). This restoration is not simply
due to an anle138b-mediated reduction in cell death, since the cell
viability of hippocampal neurons measured in the MTT assay was
identically affected by Ab1-40 monomer and oligomer treatment in
our experimental setting (Fig 5D). In this context, it is important
to state that different protocols for Ab treatment of neurons have
been used to study various effects of Ab on neuronal plasticity and
integrity. The concentration of Ab oligomers employed in our
study is within the range of these studies. Nevertheless, such data
always need to be interpreted with care since a cell culture system
cannot not fully recapitulate the situation observed in human
patients. Interestingly, anle138b treatment was also able to amelio-
rate the effect of toxic Ab species on membrane integrity if added
after neurons had been incubated with Ab oligomers and already
exhibited impaired viability, which is in line with our data show-
ing
that

LTP
and

restored memory defects in the post-plaque group (Appendix Fig
S7A and B). We also employed another experimental system to
test the effect of Ab1-42 oligomers and anle138b on biological
membranes. To this end, we employed the cytochrome release
assay (CRA) on isolated mitochondria that were exposed to either
a-synuclein, tau, or Ab1-42 oligomer in the presence or absence on
anle138b. Our data reveal a substantial damage to mitochondrial
membranes in all conditions that is attenuated by anle138b
(Appendix Fig S7C), suggesting that anle138b has general effect on
membrane integrity.
Discussion
In this work, we investigated the effect of anle138b in the estab-
lished APPPS1DE9 mouse model of AD. The APPPS1DE9 mouse
model is characterized by dysfunction of neurons and detected by
memory decline after 4 months and severe plaques formation after
6 months (Kummer et al, 2014). The most important findings of the
present study were that anle138b treatment completely restored
hippocampal LTP in the pre- and post-plaque groups of APPPS1DE9
mice. In line with this observation, spatial reference memory was
fully or partially restored in the pre- and post-plaque groups, respec-
tively. There have been numerous pre-clinical studies aiming to
restore synaptic plasticity and memory function in mouse models
for amyloid pathology. These range from therapeutic approaches
that aim to modulate causative factors including Ab-toxicity via anti-
body-based therapies (Selkoe & Hardy, 2016), small molecules that
modulated APP processing (Vassar et al, 2014), small molecules
that are thought to target toxic amyloid species directly (Doig &
Derreumaux, 2015) to symptomatic treatments not directly targeted
toward amyloids (Fischer, 2016). Anle138b belongs to the first cate-
gory. Its therapeutic effect resembles that of other small molecule
drugs. For example, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was shown to
affect Ab toxicity by redirecting toxic Ab-structures into off-pathway
oligomers (Ehrnhoefer et al, 2008; Bieschke et al, 2010). This agent
was able to ameliorate spatial memory deficits in APP mice after the
onset of amyloid deposition (Liu et al, 2014). In this context, it is
interesting to note that when administered via dry food anle138b

 was previously found to be taken up to reach levels of 100 lM in
the brain (Wagner et al, 2015). Anle138b metabolites are very
hydrophilic, and they were detected in multiple organs but were
absent in brain (Wagner et al, 2013). This indicates that anle138b is
not metabolized in the brain. Anle138b was also found to be
non-toxic in mice up to a dose of 2 g/kg. Mice receiving similar
concentrations of anle138b as used in our study lived without any
detectable toxicity, even when the drug was given longer than a
year (Wagner et al, 2015). Also in our study, no negative or positive
effects of anle138b on WT mice were observed.

 In addition to the restoration of hippocampal LTP and spatial
reference memory, we also observed restoration of physiological,
wild-type-like gene expression profile in the pre-plaque group, indi-
cating that hippocampal cells reinstate homeostasis. In APPPS1DE9
mice that received normal chow, genes linked to metabolic function
and neuronal plasticity were markedly down-regulated. Feeding with
anle138b-containing chow completely reversed this effect on gene
expression. Even in the placebo-treated pre-plaque group, we
observed little evidence for neuroinflammatory processes, which is
in contrast to the data from the post-plaque group. In fact, the gene
expression changes observed in the placebo-treated post-plaque
group were dominated by increased inflammation. These data
suggest that in APPPS1DE9 mice, the decline of synaptic plasticity
precedes inflammatory processes. Of note, anle138b treatment had

 no effect on pathological gene expression pattern in the post-plaque
group, yet hippocampal LTP was completely restored and spatial
memory was partially restored. These data suggest that therapeutic
strategies that aim to reduce amyloid toxicity—at least in the
APPPS1DE9 model—may have little influence on neuroinflammation
when applied at an advanced stage of the disease. Nevertheless, a
significant therapeutic effect could be observed in the post-plaque
group. This might be explained by removal of toxic Ab species which
can lead to the restoration of synaptic function in neurons even in a
detrimental inflammatory environment. These data are highly inter-
esting, since one argument for the failure of clinical trials targeting
amyloid deposition or modulation of Ab cleavage is that such
treatments are ineffective when given at an advanced stage of
the diseases. Our data suggest, however, that anle138b targets Ab-
related pathological events that allow recovery of synaptic function
even if secondary pathological events such as inflammation
persist.
The finding that anle138b treatment ameliorates synaptic plastic-
ity and learning deficits in APPPS1DE9 is of utmost importance.
These data are in line with previous observations showing that the
same compounds have beneficial effects in animal models for
Creutzfeld-Jakob, Parkinson’s disease, and Tau pathology. Specifi-
cally, the latter finding is intriguing, since Tau and Ab pathology are
believed to be the main causative factors of AD pathogenesis. While
Wagner et al (2015) showed that anle138b in Tau P301S mice
rescues synaptic and neuronal loss, we could further substantiate
these data by showing that anle138b treatment also ameliorates
defects in hippocampal transcriptome plasticity in the same Tau
P301S mice. Taken together, these data suggest the revealing possi-
bility that anle138b is able to ameliorate Tau and Ab pathology.
Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, anle138b would be the first
small molecule that has a direct effect on the two major hallmarks
of AD.
These data are also important from a translational point of view.
Taking into account that the various animal models for AD only
recapitulate part of the pathogenesis observed in human patients, it
is intriguing that anle138b was able to rescue disease progression in
various different AD models and models for aggregopathies, raising
the hope that anle138b could also be effective in human patients.
The mechanism by which toxic Ab species induce synaptic
dysfunction and neurotoxicity is still unresolved. Proposed mecha-
nisms include NMDA receptor endocytosis (Shankar et al, 2007), a-
amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid surface recep-
tor modulation (Querfurth & LaFerla, 2010), and Ab pore formation
(Arispe et al, 1993). Moreover, the presence of amyloid plaques was
shown to change structural plasticity of neurons (Spires & Hyman,
2004). Nevertheless, amyloid plaques are unlikely the sole reason
for disturbed synaptic function and memory consolidation in AD
and it has even been suggested that they present a compensatory
mechanism of the brain in order to deal with toxic Ab species
(Selkoe & Hardy, 2016). This is further supported by our findings
that anle138b treatment in the post-plaque group was able to restore
hippocampal LTP and spatial reference memory, although the
plaque load was even higher when compared to placebo-treated
APPPS1DE9 mice of the pre-plaque group suggesting that the reduc-
tion in amyloid plaque load cannot be the main mechanisms by
which anle138b exerts its therapeutic action. The pore formation
hypothesis has long been proposed but tested experimentally to a
very limited degree, which is also due to the fact that an array of
various in vitro and in vivo methods needs to be combined to
address this issue. We focused on the question whether anle138b
modulates the pore forming activity of Ab because synaptic function
relies on the integrity of membranes and their ability to modulate
ion fluxes in a voltage-dependent way. This pore-based mechanism
has been envisaged to underlie impaired neuronal function and cell
death (Arispe et al, 1993). Modulation of pore formation was also
implicated in cell-based models for EGCG mode of action (Diaz
et al, 2009) and of its congeners MRS2481 and MRS2485 (Diaz et al,
2009). The observed stepwise growth of bulk membrane conduc-
tance in the presence of Ab (without anle138b) indicates that activ-
ity increases through the combined action of many individual pores.
Numerous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Jang et al,
2008; Arce et al, 2011; Gillman et al, 2014) and NMR spectroscopy-
based investigations (Sarkar et al, 2014) of Ab pores have pointed
to a b-barrel structure for the intramembrane region of the pore. It
was previously shown that Ab containing a point substituted proline
(F19P) showed pore structure by AFM but did not demonstrate ionic
conductance (Capone et al, 2012; Connelly et al, 2012b). The chem-
ical structure of proline introduces a “kink” in the peptide’s
secondary structure, which is known to disrupt b-sheet formation.
MD simulations of F19P barrel structure showed that b-sheet desta-
bilization led the highly charged N-terminal regions to bind at the
peptide mouth and collapsed the pore (Umehara et al, 2010;
Connelly et al, 2012a). Our data are consistent with such a model
and suggest that anle138b induces a conformational change within
Ab pores that greatly reduces or, in most pores eliminates, ionic
flux. Steric blockage by anle138b without a conformational change
of the pore is energetically unfavorable due to the hydrophobicity of
anle138b, as this scenario would require anle138b to be in contact
with water molecules inside the pore. The above-mentioned mecha-
nisms provide further insight into the method of action in prevent-
ing pore activity and reducing Alzheimer’s pathogenicity (Fig 5E).
It has to be mentioned, however, that all of the above-described
experiments are based on in vitro approaches using lipid bilayers. In
vivo evidence further supporting the notion that anle138b counter-
acts the detrimental effect of toxic Ab species on membrane integrity
stems from our finding that Ab1-40 administration to cultured
hippocampal neurons compromised membrane integrity, an effect
which was attenuated by anle138b. Our interpretation that conver-
sion of conducting to non-conduction Ab pores is one possible mode
of anle138b action. It may also explain that anle138b ameliorated all
tested disease phenotypes in the pre-plaque group, while in the
post-plaque group only LTP was completely restored. Hence, in the
post-plaque group, the presence of toxic Ab species may already
have induced secondary processes such as inflammation that persis-
tently affects memory function even if membrane integrity and LTP
are restored in neurons. Yet, we like to reiterate that while our data
point to the existence of Ab pores in vivo, a definite proof is still
missing. Further evidence in support of the Ab pores stems from a
study in which Ab oligomers induce single-channel calcium fluores-
cence transients in Xenopus oocytes (Demuro et al, 2011). Never-
theless, we cannot exclude that anle138b affects other cellular
processes than Ab-mediated conducting pores in membranes. Thus,
it is also possible for example that in vivo Ab sequesters membrane
lipids,
thereby
affecting
membrane
integrity,
which
is
then
prevented by the action of anle138b.

 In conclusion, our data show that anle138b can reinstate
synaptic plasticity and memory function in a mouse model for
amyloid pathology via mechanisms that—at least in part—appear
to involve the blockage of Ab-induced pores in membranes. Care-
ful analysis of this activity indicates that the oligomers are still in
the membrane, but pores have a changed conductivity profile,
mainly staying open for shorter time and lacking the possibility of
building up large currents as seen when anle138b was absent.
Taking into account that anle138b was also shown to ameliorate
disease phenotypes in a mouse model for Tau pathology, thus
being to the best of our knowledge one of the first compounds
that seems to causatively interfere with both of the two major
hallmarks of AD, we suggest that anle138b to further be validated
in clinical trials for its potential to treat AD and perhaps other
aggregopathies.
Materials and Methods
Mouse experiments
The APP(Swe)/PS1ED9 (henceforth called: APPPS1DE9) mouse
model of AD was used for this study. The age of the animals is indi-
cated for each experiment. In brief, mice of the pre-plaque group
were analyzed at 6 months of age, while mice of the post-plaque
group were 10 months of age. Upon completion of treatment, these
and control mice underwent cognitive assessment by a behavior
battery of tests. Electrophysiology, RNA sequencing, and histochem-
ical analysis of plaque burden were also assessed. All mice were
male and were maintained on a C57BL/6 background. They were
kept in a 12-h dark/light cycle and housed in groups under constant
standard conditions of temperature and humidity. Mice had ad libi-
tum access to food and water. Animal care and handling were
carried out in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and
approved by local ethical committees.
Anle138b treatment
In order to investigate the prophylactic effect of anle138b, we
treated healthy, plaque-free, adult, APPPS1D9 mice with placebo-
or anle138b-containing dry food pellets for 4 months from 2 to
6 months of age (pre-plaque group; Fig EV1). Age- and sex-
matched wild-type littermates were also treated and served as
controls. Similarly, in order to investigate the therapeutic effect of
anle138b, we treated symptomatic APPPS1DE9 mice and treated
them for 4 months from 6 to 10 months of age (post-plaque group;
Fig EV1). Controls were age- and sex-matched wild-type litter-
mates treated with anle138b or placebo. Anle138b was adminis-
tered
orally.
Dry
food
pellets
were
prepared
containing
2g
anle138b per kg food (SSNIFF). This amounted to an estimated
daily dose of 500 mg/kg (at an approx. 6-g daily food consumption
and a 25-g average body weight). Based on pharmacokinetic stud-
ies, 40–70 lM anle138b reached the brain during most of the wake
phase (Wagner et al, 2015). Placebo food was prepared from the
same batch but without anle138b (SSNIFF). Of note, our previous
PK studies in mice have shown that after a single bolus the half-
life of anle138b in the brain is approximately 4 h (Wagner et al,
2013).
Morris water maze (MWM)
Mice were single-caged and brought into the testing room at
least 1 week prior to the beginning of the experiment to allow
them to acclimate. In the MWM, mice were trained to find a
submerged 10 × 10 cm platform in a pool (1.10 m in diameter)
of milky water using spatial cues by the pool sides as orienta-
tion points. Mice were trained over 8 consecutive days with four
trials per day per mouse. Time and path to platform were
tracked and recorded (TSE systems). On day 9 (probe test), the
platform was removed and quadrant preference was recorded
(target quadrant being the one where the platform was previ-
ously located).
Open field
Mice were allowed to spend 5 min in an open arena (40 × 40 cm).
Path length while exploring and time in the center or corners were
quantified using the VideoMot2 System (TSE).
RNA sequencing
Library preparation and cluster generation for mRNA sequencing
were performed according to Illumina standard protocols (TruSeq,
Illumina). Libraries were quality-controlled and quantified using a
Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific), Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agi-
lent Technologies), and Qubit (Life Technologies). Data will be
made available upon publication via GEO (accession number
GSE104424). Base calling from raw images and file conversion to
fastq-files was achieved by Illumina pipeline scripts. Subsequent
steps included quality control (FastQC, https://www.bioinformatics.
babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), mapping to reference genome
(mm10, STAR aligner v2.3.0 (Djebali et al, 2012) non-default
parameters), read counting on genes or exons (HTSeq, http://www-
huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq,
mode:
intersection-non-
empty), and differential gene (DESeq2_1.4.5; Love et al, 2014)
usage biostatistical analysis. PCA and distance heat maps were
generated in R following instructions in the vignette for DESeq2.
Genes were considered differentially expressed with an adjusted
P-value lower than 0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg). Gene set overlaps
were calculated using Venny (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/ve
nny/). Pathway analysis was performed using Cytoscape (www.cy
toscape.com) and Cytoscape extension ClueGO.
Electrophysiology on hippocampal slices
Slice preparation
Acute hippocampal slices prepared from WT mice and APPPS1DE9
mice were used for electrophysiological recordings. All the proce-
dures were carried out in compliance to the guidelines from the
Animal Committee on Ethics in the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of TU-Braunschweig. Briefly, after anesthetization using
CO2, the mice were decapitated and the brains were quickly
removed and cooled in 2–4°C artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF).
The hippocampi were dissected, and transverse hippocampal slices
(400 lm) were prepared by using a manual tissue chopper. Then,
slices were incubated for 3 h at 32°C in an interface chamber (Scien-
tific

 oxygenated aCSF at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The aCSF contained
the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 4.9 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 2.0 MgSO4,
2.0 CaCl2, 24.6 NaHCO3, 10 D-glucose, equilibrated with 95%
O2–5% CO2 (32 L/h).
Slice recordings
To evoke field EPSP (fEPSP) from Schaffer collateral/commissural-
CA1 synapses, one monopolar lacquer-coated, stainless-steel elec-
trode (5 MΩ; AM Systems) was positioned at the stratum radiatum
layer of the CA1 region. For recording fEPSP (measured as its initial
slope function), one electrode (5 MΩ; AM Systems) was placed in
the CA1 apical dendritic layer and signals were amplified by a dif-
ferential amplifier (Model 1700, AM Systems). The signals were
digitized using a CED 1401 analog-to-digital converter (Cambridge
Electronic Design). After the preincubation period, an input–output
curve (afferent stimulation vs. fEPSP slope) was generated. Test
stimulation intensity was adjusted to elicit fEPSP slope of � 40% of
the maximal fEPSP response. Four 0.2-Hz biphasic constant current
pulses (0.1 ms/polarity) were used for baseline recording and test-
ing at each time point. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was elicited by
“strong” tetanus (STET) consisting of three stimulus trains of 100
pulses at 100 Hz delivered at 10-min intervals (300 pulses in total).
Data (fEPSP slope) were normalized to baseline and plotted as aver-
age � SEM. The average values of the slope function of the fEPSP
(millivolts per milliseconds) for each time point were analyzed
using
paired
t-test;
P < 0.05
was
considered
as
statistically
significant.
Thioflavin S staining
Thioflavin S staining was performed as previously described with
the some modifications (Guntern et al, 1992; Sun et al, 2002).
Briefly, mice were sacrificed and their brain quickly removed on ice.
Left hemispheres were embedded in OCT (Tissue TEK) and stored
at �80°C until ready to section. Sagittal, 25-lm-thick sections were
cut using a cryostat. And, five sets of five slides per brain containing
four sections/slide were made by taking every 5th section on the
same slide, so that each set consisted of 20 representative sections
throughout the brain. Sets to be used for thioflavin S staining were
then fixed with 4% PFA for 25 min at room temperature, washed
twice with 0.9% NaCl, and quickly rinsed with PBS. Staining was
performed using filtered 0.05% thioflavin S in 50% ethanol for
8 min in the dark and differentiated with two changes of 80%
ethanol for 10 s. This was followed by three washes with large
volumes of distilled water and an incubation step in high-concen-
trated phosphate buffer (411 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM KCl, 30 mM
Na2HPO4, 5.2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2) at 4°C for 30 min. Finally, slides
were briefly rinsed in PBST and covered with coverslips using
Vectashield Hard Set mounting media with DAPI (Vector). Slides
were allowed to set in the dark at 4°C and imaged immediately
thereafter. To control for background, unspecific staining, or tissue
auto-fluorescence, slides from age-matched wild-type brains were
used as negative controls. Images at 4× magnification of hippocam-
pus and cortex were captured using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence
microscope. Quantification of number of plaques, area covered by
the plaque, and average plaque size was performed using the parti-
cle analysis tool of the ImageJ software. Statistical analysis was
carried out using GraphPad Prism7.
Biophysical experiments on Ab1-42
Materials
Ab1–42 was purchased from Bachem and Anaspec (Fremont, CA).
The
phospholipids
1.2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine
(DOPS) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(POPE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).
All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO).
Peptide handling
For BLM experiments, Ab1–42 peptides were dissolved in Milli-Q
water to a concentration of 1 mg/ml prior to being aliquoted for
storage. These 50-ll aliquots were stored at �80°C for a maximum
of 60 days before use. Samples were thawed only once. For AFM
experiments, powder form of Ab1-42 (Bachem, Torrance, CA) was
first dissolved in 1% ammonium hydroxide until the peptides were
completely dissolved. They were subsequently sonicated for approx-
imately 2 min. Small volume of peptides were then aliquoted and
lyophilized using a lyophilizer (Labconco FreeZone 2.5 Plus, Kansas
City, KS). The aliquots were stored at �80°C until used. For every
experiment, aliquoted peptides were thawed and hydrated in
20 mM NaOH and HEPES buffer solutions at pH 7.4, sequentially.
The peptide concentration was measured using the 280 nm UV
absorbance (e = 1,490 M�1 cm�1).
Peptide aggregation
Synthetic Ab1-40 and Ab1-42 powders were dissolved in 20 mM
NaOH at 2 mg/ml concentration and incubated at 4°C for 1 h to
dissolve their pre-existing aggregates. The Ab stock solutions
were then brought to PBS, pH 7.4, at a final peptide concentra-
tion of 0.4 mg/ml, around 90 lM. After a short centrifugation
(16,000 g, 30 min), the supernatants were used either directly, as
the monomeric Ab, or following a 3-h incubation at 37°C (with-
out agitation), as the oligomeric-enriched Ab samples. The mono-
meric and oligomeric-enriched Ab samples were then added to
primary neuronal cultures for membrane integrity and viability
assays.
Electrical recording of planar lipid bilayer made of oxidized cholesterol/
n-decane
We prepared planar lipid bilayers using the Mu
¨ller-Rudin technique
(Benz et al, 1978). The membranes were formed from a 1% (w/v)
solution of oxidized cholesterol in n-decane. Oxidized cholesterol
was prepared according to an established procedure (Benz et al,
1978). The lipid membranes were formed using a Teflon loop to
spread the lipid solution across a hole with a surface area of approx-
imately 0.3 mm2 in the wall dividing the two aqueous compart-
ments in a Teflon cell. After the membrane had turned black, the
Ab1–42 peptide-containing protein fractions were added to the aque-
ous phase on one or both sides of the membrane at final concentra-
tions 1 and 40 lM. For doping lipid bilayers with anle138b, the
compound was dissolved in chloroform. The chloroform of a sample
was then evaporated under vacuum. The lipid solution was added
to the dry anle138b in such an amount that a final concentration of
1 mM in the lipid solution was obtained. This lipid solution was
used for the normal protocol of bilayer formation as described
above.

 The current across the lipid bilayer membranes was measured
with a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes with salt bridges switched in
series with a voltage source and a highly sensitive current amplifier
Keithley 427 (Keithley Instruments, INC. Cleveland, OH). The
output signal of the amplifier was recorded by a strip chart recorder
(Rikadenki Electronics GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). The temperature
was kept at 20°C throughout the experiment.
Planar lipid bilayer electrical recording using DOPS and POPE
We prepared planar lipid bilayers using the so-called painted
technique (Mueller et al, 1962). Anle138b was mixed with a 1:1
(w/w) solution of DOPS and POPE in chloroform at a concentra-
tion of 10 mM with respect to the volume of the lipids. A lipid
specific gravity of 0.8 was used for the calculation. This mixture
was subsequently dried in a Rotavapor R-210 (Buchi) and resus-
pended in decane at a total lipid concentration of 20 mg/ml.
Bilayers with embedded anle138b were formed from this solution.
Spontaneous membrane formation occurs following the addition
of lipid directly over a pore with a diameter of ~250 lm in a
Delrin septum (Warner Instruments, Delrin perfusion cup, volume
1 ml).
In
previous
studies,
this
membrane
composition
was
shown to be stable for long recording times (~4 h; Capone et al,
2012).
Control
experiments
establishing
the
stability
of
membranes
formed
with
the
addition
of
anle138b
were
performed. We used 150 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and
1 mM MgCl2 as the electrolyte.
We observed the following difficulty in the preparation of
anle138b loaded lipids. Anle138b was dissolved in decane along
with the lipids prior to membrane painting. Since anle138b is
soluble in both the decane and the lipids, the distribution of
compound in the lipid membrane that spontaneously forms upon
lipid deposition over the aperture can vary. Lipid monolayers bind
to either side of the partition and the bilayer membrane forms as the
monolayers fuse together at the center, excluding the decane solvent
to the perimeter. This solvent annulus acts as a bridge to the Delrin
partition and is essential for membrane stability (White, 1972). If a
significant proportion of the anle138b is mobile in the decane, the
compound could be partitioned to the solvent annulus rather than
incorporated into the membrane leading to BLM results that appear
similar to that seen with Ab1-42 in the absence of compound. This
can explain why anle138b modulated the activity of the pores in
only 50% of the cases.
Before performing electrical recordings, we verified that the
bilayer was stable for several minutes with low conductance
(<10 pS) across � 100 mV applied voltage and that the system
capacitance was >110 pF. When both criteria were met, peptide was
added directly to the cis (hot wire) side and stirred for 5 min.
Peptide concentration in the bilayer chamber was approximately
10 lM. Bilayer stability was monitored by periodic capacitance
measurements throughout the course of the experiment.
All traces were recorded in voltage clamp mode using the 2 kHz
built-in filter cutoff of our BC-535 amplifier (Warner Instruments,
Hamden, CT). A sampling frequency of 15 kHz was used for all data
acquisition. We used a custom-made LabVIEW program to record
the current and Clampfit 10.2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA)
to analyze traces. We have filtered the recorded current versus time
traces with a digital Gaussian low-pass filter and a cutoff frequency
of 50 Hz for representation in figures.
Lipid bilayer preparation for AFM imaging
For liposome preparation, DOPS and POPE lipids were used in a 1:1
ratio (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Al). Liposomes were prepared
by mixing 20 ll of each lipid (5 mg/ml) dissolved in chloroform,
and anle138b, also in chloroform, was added to a 1,000:1 lipid to
anle138b molar ratio. Then, liposomes were allowed to dry over-
night in vacuum. The dried lipid film (and anle138b) was hydrated
with peptide solution (1:60 peptide to lipid molar ratio) to facilitate
peptide incorporation in the lipid bilayer, resulting in proteolipo-
some formation. For controls, the dried lipid film (and anle138b)
was hydrated with 200 ll of HEPES buffer and vortexed occasion-
ally for an hour. The large multilamellar vesicles formed with this
procedure were sonicated for 5 min. Supported lipid bilayers were
formed by (proteo)liposome rupture and fusion on the mica
substrate (Lin et al, 2001; Quist et al, 2005; Liu et al, 2006;
Umehara et al, 2010; Connelly et al, 2012a,b). Lipid concentrations
of 0.1–1 mg/ml were deposited on freshly cleaved mica and incu-
bated for ~10 min on a hot plate above the lipid transition tempera-
ture to facilitate fusion of the ruptured proteoliposomes on the mica
surface. As a last step, samples were rinsed with buffer to remove
unruptured proteoliposomes still in solution.
AFM imaging on membranes
Topographic
images
were
acquired
using
a
Multimode
AFM
equipped with a Nanoscope V controller (Bruker, Santa Barbara,
CA). Silicon nitride cantilevers with nominal spring constants of
0.08 N/m (OMCL-TR400, Olympus) were employed for imaging in
fluid using the tapping mode. Resonance frequencies of � 8 kHz
and drive amplitudes under 100 mV were used. All experiments
were performed at room temperature. Actual spring constants were
measured to be within 10% of its nominal value using thermal tune
before the experiments. To measure outer pore diameters, tip broad-
ening was taken into account by modeling the inserted oligomers as
a spherical cap protruding a height h above the surface of the lipid
bilayer in contact with a spherical tip of radius R (Lee et al, 2014).
Cell membrane integrity and viability
CyQUANT
Primary neuronal cultures were produced from E17.5 CD1 Swiss
embryos. On DIV, 10 cultures were treated conditioned medium
supplemented with anle138b to a final concentration of 1 lM in
0.05% DMSO (Roth, A994.2) or 0.05% DMSO as vehicle. After 24 h
Ab1-40 oligomers, monomers or buffer (n = 4 each) was applied at
10 lM and incubated for 48 h. CyQUANT� Direct Cell Proliferation
Assay (Thermo Fisher, C35011) was used according to manufac-
turer’s protocol to determine membrane integrity. After 30-min incu-
bation, fluorescence was measured with a Tecan infinite 200.
Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism.
MTT assay
Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay with the same
sample preparation as for the CyQUANT assay. Briefly, after anle138b
and Ab1-40 treatment, the cell culture medium was supplemented
with MTT to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubated for
1 h at 37°C in a standard cell culture incubator. Subsequently,
medium was removed and metabolites suspended in 500 ll DMSO.
Absorption at 800 nm was measured using a Tecan infinite 200.

 Transgenic flies and survival assays
w[1118]; P{UAS-Arctic Ab 1-42 (Glu22Gly)}(arc2E) transgenic flies
were kindly provided by D. Crowther (Cambridge, UK; Crowther et al,
2005). The co-expression of Gal4 under a tissue specific promotor
leads to activation of an upstream activating sequence (UAS)
element that activates the transcription of Ab42 upon Gal4-UAS
binding (Brand & Perrimon, 1993). We controlled the temporal
expression of the Gal4-UAS system by a temperature-sensitive
Gal80ts under a ubiquitously expressing tubulin promoter (tub-
Gal80ts) (McGuire et al, 2003). Gal80ts represses the transcriptional
activity of Gal4 at the permissive temperature (18°C). Upon a shift
to
the
non-permissive
temperature
(30°C),
Gal80ts
becomes
dysfunctional and releases the Gal4-UAS system to allow transgene
expression. Neuron-specific and temperature-inducible expression
of Ab42 was achieved by crossing the w[1118]; Gal4-elav/CyO;
TM2/TM6 and w[1118]; Sp/CyO; tubGal80ts/TM2 lines obtained
from Bloomington (Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC),
Indiana University, USA) to generate w[1118]; Gal4-elav/(CyO);
tubGal80ts/(TM6). The w[11118]; P{UAS-Arctic Ab 1-42 (Glu22Gly)}
line was crossed with w[1118]; Gal4-elav/(CyO);tubGal80 ts/(TM6).
w[1118]; Gal4-elav/UAS-arc2E;tubGal80/+ were used for subsequent
survival assays. As an overexpression control, we crossed w[1118];
Gal4-elav/(CyO);tubGal80/(TM6)
with
w[1118];
P{w[+mC]=UAS-
lacZ.NZ}20b (Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC), Indi-
ana University, USA) to obtain w[1118]; Gal4-elav/+; tubGal80ts/
UAS-lacZ.
Survival assay
Male flies expressing Ab42 Glu22Gly arctic mutation and control
flies expressing lacZ were collected and maintained under a 12-h
light–dark cycle in 60% relative humidity and equal population
density per vial. Within 24 h after eclosion from the pupae, all flies
were transferred to the restrictive temperature. Compounds were
dissolved at 10 mM in DMSO and mixed with yeast. Fresh food was
added every 2nd–3rd day. As a control, Ab42 Glu22Gly transgenic
and lacZ control flies were treated with DMSO food without addition
of compounds. Surviving flies were counted every 2nd–3rd day. The
resulting Kaplan–Meier survival curves were calculated using SSPS
software. Differences between the genotypes were assessed by log-
rank test (SSPS software).
Statistical analysis
Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, data were analyzed by
unpaired Student’s t-test, two tailed t-test, Bonferroni test for multi-
ple comparisons, or one and two-way and ANOVA (analysis of vari-
ance) when appropriate. Errors are displayed as standard error of
mean (SEM). Unless otherwise stated, analysis was performed using
GraphPad Prism.

The paper explained
Problem
A hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease is the aggregation of Ab, yet the
mechanism of dysfunction of neurons and neuronal death is unclear
and disease-modifying therapeutic intervention is not yet possible.
Results
Using the APPPS1 overexpression model in mice, we show that the
diphenylpyrazole compound anle138b, an orally available small mole-
cule reaching 30 lM concentration in the brain when given orally,
ameliorated disease phenotypes such as hippocampal LTP, spatial
reference memory, and transcriptional homeostasis. Biophysical analy-
sis suggests that pore formation contributes to the dysfunctionaliza-
tion and death of neurons, while anle138b prevents pore formation
and thereby rescues these effects.
Impact
Our work provides evidence of the molecular mechanisms by which
Ab aggregation is contributing to Alzheimer’s disease, namely pore
formation in membranes by Ab oligomers whose conductivity is
reduced by more than a factor of 10 by anle138b treatment. The pore
conductivity reduction correlates with the full refunctionalization as
measured by LTP when anle138b is given before or after the onset of
amyloid deposition. Also memory function is improved. Our data
suggest that therapeutical effects can be expected to be achieved in
AD patients with anle138b.
