Multicenter Cohort Study of Oxidative Stress (ALS COSMOS) Study Group
IMPORTANCE There is growing interest in the role of nutrition in the pathogenesis and
progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the associations between nutrients, individually and in groups, and
ALS function and respiratory function at diagnosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional baseline analysis of the Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis Multicenter Cohort Study of Oxidative Stress study was conducted from
March 14, 2008, to February 27, 2013, at 16 ALS clinics throughout the United States among
302 patients with ALS symptom duration of 18 months or less.
EXPOSURES Nutrient intake, measured using a modified Block Food Frequency Questionnaire
(FFQ).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis function, measured using the
ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R), and respiratory function, measured using
percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC).
RESULTS Baseline data were available on 302 patients with ALS (median age, 63.2 years
[interquartile range, 55.5-68.0 years]; 178 men and 124 women). Regression analysis of
nutrients found that higher intakes of antioxidants and carotenes from vegetables were
associated with higher ALSFRS-R scores or percentage FVC. Empirically weighted indices
using the weighted quantile sum regression method of “
good”micronutrients and “
good”
food groups were positively associated with ALSFRS-R scores (β [SE], 2.7 [0.69] and 2.9
[0.9], respectively) and percentage FVC (β [SE], 12.1 [2.8] and 11.5 [3.4], respectively) (all
P < .001). Positive and significant associations with ALSFRS-R scores (β [SE], 1.5 [0.61];
P = .02) and percentage FVC (β [SE], 5.2 [2.2]; P = .02) for selected vitamins were found in
exploratory analyses.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Antioxidants, carotenes, fruits, and vegetables were
associated with higher ALS function at baseline by regression of nutrient indices and
weighted quantile sum regression analysis. We also demonstrated the usefulness of the
weighted quantile sum regression method in the evaluation of diet. Those responsible for
nutritional care of the patient with ALS should consider promoting fruit and vegetable intake
since they are high in antioxidants and carotenes.

A
myotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurode-
generative disorder that causes progressive muscle at-
rophy, paralysis, and eventual respiratory failure. The
incidence rate of ALS ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 per 100 000 indi-
viduals per year, with a prevalence rate of approximately 3.9 to
8per100000individualsintheUnitedStates.1Malesareslightly
more affected than females, with a ratio of approximately 1.6:1.
The median survival time from onset of ALS ranges from 20 to
48 months, but 10% to 20% of patients survive longer than 10
years.2 There is growing interest in the role of nutrition and en-
vironmental factors in the pathogenesis and progression of
ALS.3,4 There is some evidence that risk of ALS increases with
increasedintakeofmacronutrients,suchascarbohydrates,glu-
tamate, and fat, and with low intake of various micronutri-
ents, including vitamin E, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and
carotenoids, as well as fruits and vegetables, although this risk
isnotconsistentlydemonstratedinstudies.5-13Inarecentanaly-
sis of data pooled from 5 cohort studies with a total of 995 pa-
tientswithALS,thehighestintakeofω-3polyunsaturatedfatty
acids as compared with the lowest intake was associated with
a 34% reduced risk of ALS.14 Risk of ALS is also inversely asso-
ciated with body mass index (BMI).15
Previous research suggests that oxidative stress is associ-
ated with the pathogenesis of ALS; there is some evidence that
dietary factors may increase5,6,16-20 or potentially decrease5-14
oxidative stress. Previous studies have not evaluated whether
nutrients or foods are associated with ALS or respiratory func-
tion soon after diagnosis. Using data from a study of ALS pro-
gression, our analysis examines associations between nutri-
tional intake and functional performance (measured by ALS
Functional Rating Scale–Revised [ALSFRS-R]21 scores) and re-
spiratory function (measured as forced vital capacity [FVC])
at the time of study entry.
Methods
Patients diagnosed with ALS based on revised El Escorial22 or
Awaji23 criteria less than 18 months after symptom onset were
recruited into the longitudinal ALS Multicenter Cohort Study
of Oxidative Stress (ALS COSMOS) study from March 14, 2008,
to February 27, 2013, at 16 clinical centers located throughout
the United States. Detailed description of patients and meth-
ods were previously reported.24 This study is a cross-sec-
tional analysis of baseline data.
The procedures followed were in accordance with the ethi-
cal standards of each institutional review board where ap-
proval was obtained for each of the 16 clinical sites. Written
consent was provided where possible and if the patient was
unable to provide written consent, verbal consent with an in-
dependent witness was obtained.
Demographic and Neurologic Data
Clinical assessment included height, weight, scores on the
ALSFRS-R using a 12-item questionnaire, percentage FVC, and
acomprehensiveneurologicexamination.TheALSFRS-Risthe
most widely used clinical outcome in ALS clinical trials25 and
has been extensively validated.26-28
Dietary Data
To assess diet, we used a modification of the previously vali-
dated Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ),29-32 which
entailed shortening the questionnaire from 127 to 85 items so
that completion time would be approximately 15 minutes,
similar to previously validated FFQs. Food frequency ques-
tionnaires are preferred to assess usual dietary intakes.33 Our
shortened FFQ assessed specific intake information, focusing
on foods and nutrients considered to be antioxidants; vita-
mins A, C, and E; β-carotene; calcium; iron; zinc; and sele-
nium. In addition to the 85 questions, there was an open-
ended section on additional foods consumed, 10 summary
questions, and 19 questions about supplement intake. Par-
ticipants self-administered the FFQ, with caregiver assis-
tance if needed. All completed FFQ forms were scanned by
Nutritionquest,34 which converted FFQ data into estimates of
average daily nutrient intake using a standardized reference
nutrient database and provided food-specific and food group
intake data.
Given that antioxidants may be particularly important, we
a priori estimated a carotene index, which was a sum of ter-
tile groupings (low, 1; moderate, 2; and high, 3) of α-carotene,
β-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lutein and zeaxanthin, and lyco-
pene. The a priori antioxidant index included these nutrients
as well as similar tertile groupings of vitamin C, vitamin E, se-
lenium, and quercetin. We administered the survey twice to
29 patients with ALS and there were no differences in the nu-
trients of interest between the results of first and second FFQ
(Wilcoxon signed rank test). The intraclass correlation coeffi-
cients ranged from 0.62 to 0.87 for all nutrients analyzed, ex-
cept for lycopene (r = 0.35).
Groups of Variables
Nutrients and food groups were grouped for further analysis
based on their anticipated association with ALS function
(from a review of the literature); items were primarily
grouped as “good” if they had antioxidant properties or were
previously associated with reduced risk of ALS5-14 or as “bad”
based on association with oxidative stress or increased risk of
ALS.5,6,16-20 Micronutrients considered potentially good were
vitamin C; vitamin E; α-carotene; β-carotene; cryptoxanthin;
lutein and zeaxanthin; selenium; lycopene; quercetin; ω-3
fatty acids; isoflavones; cysteine; vitamin A; vitamin D; fiber
from beans, vegetables, and fruit, and grains; and ω-6 fatty
Key Points
Question What is the association between nutrient intake and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis function and respiratory function at
diagnosis?
Findings In this cross-sectional analysis of a multicenter cohort of
302 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, antioxidants,
carotenes, fruits, and vegetables were associated with higher
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis function at baseline.
Meaning Nutritional care of the patient with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis should include promotion of foods high in antioxidants
and carotenes, including fruits and vegetables.

acids. Micronutrients considered potentially bad were trans-
fat, saturated fats, ω-6 fatty acids, total sugars, high ratio of
ω-6 to ω-3 fatty acids, and methionine. Macronutrients con-
sidered potentially good were food energy (calories), protein,
and carbohydrates; macronutrients considered potentially
bad were dietary fat and sugary beverages. Food groups con-
sidered potentially good were whole grains; milk; yogurt;
solid fruits; fruit juice; legumes; eggs; fish high in ω-3 fatty
acids; fish low in ω-3 fatty acids; poultry; soy foods; protein
from nuts and seeds; beneficial oils (from fish, nuts, avocado,
and dressing); deep yellow, orange, and dark green veg-
etables; other vegetables (not dark green, yellow, or orange);
potatoes; and tomatoes. Food groups considered potentially
bad were oils, sweets, sodas, cheese, milk, eggs, beef, pork,
lamb, and lunch meats.
In addition, exploratory analyses were performed on a se-
riesofnutrientsconsideredpotentiallygood(calcium,iron,po-
tassium, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc,
vitamin B6, magnesium, retinol, vitamin D [in micrograms],
vitamin K, selenium, and total glutathione) vs nutrients con-
sidered potentially bad (phosphorous, sodium, caffeine, and
foods resulting in a high glycemic index). The use of groups of
nutrients and foods allows examination of nutrients that are
highly correlated based on the dietary patterns of individuals.
Moreover,ourweightedquantilesum(WQS)regressionmethod,
described below, ensures that nutrients that are grouped in-
correctly will have a smaller weight in the proposed group-
ings. Thus, we were able to simultaneously examine nutri-
entsinsteadofrelyingonexaminingindividualnutrients,which
is a less optimal method and more prone to type I error.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical models used ALSFRS-R score or percentage FVC
as the outcome variables. We included covariates if the asso-
ciation (estimated β coefficient) changed by 10% comparing
models with and without the covariates. Thus, our final mod-
els included age, sex, current BMI, duration of symptoms,
and caloric intake. Regression analysis was performed using
the carotene index and antioxidant index as the primary
exposures.
We also used WQS regression35,36 to account for the colin-
earity between nutrient exposures. Briefly, nutrients and food
groups were grouped a priori. For each food grouping, WQS re-
gression resulted in an empirically weighted sum of the quar-
tiles of the food group components. Each WQS regression in-
dexwasincludedinaregressionmodel,adjustedforcovariates.
The corresponding weights were used to identify important
components when the regression coefficient of the index was
significant. The WQS regression method is robust against im-
proper assignment of a nutrient or food type as good or bad
since that nutrient or food will be assigned a negligible weight,
minimizing potential error in nutrient grouping.
Results
Atotalof355patientswereeligibleandenrolledinALSCOMOS,
while 477 potentially eligible but nonenrolled patients were
reported by the sites. Major reasons for exclusion were that the
study was not discussed (253 [53%]), patients refused to par-
ticipate (143 [30%]), or patients were overwhelmed with their
diagnosis(38[8%]).24Therewerenodifferencesbetweenthose
enrolled and those not enrolled on demographics (eg, age, sex,
and race/ethnicity), duration of disease, El Escorial Criteria di-
agnostic groups, participation in clinical trials, and use of al-
ternative treatments; however, enrolled patients were more
likely to have private insurance and less likely to be covered
by Medicare compared with those who were not enrolled.24
A total of 53 patients did not have ALSFRS-R performed or
FVC measured or nutrition data were not available, leaving
302 patients for this analysis. These 302 patients (178 men
[58.9%]) had a median age of 63.2 years (interquartile range
[IQR], 55.5-68.0 years), median BMI (calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 26 (IQR,
23.5-28.5), and median symptom duration of 0.94 year (IQR,
0.65-1.25 years). At the baseline visit, approximately half of
the patients reported eating problems early in the course of
the disease and occasional choking. Two hundred sixteen
patients (71.5%) had a spinal onset of disease and 85 (27.7%)
had bulbar onset. The median ALSFRS-R score was 37 (IQR,
33-41), reflecting modestly severe ALS, and median FVC was
82% (IQR, 66%-97%), reflecting low normal respiratory func-
tion. Higher ALSFRS-R scores and higher percentage of FVC
indicate better function.
The mean (SD) daily total calorie intake was 1730 (747);
mean daily intake of other nutrients is listed in Table 1. There
was no significant difference in caloric intake between those
who reported eating problems early in the course of the dis-
ease and occasional choking at the baseline visit (1827 calo-
ries per day) compared with those who did not report such
problems (1692 calories per day).
After controlling for age, sex, duration of symptoms, cur-
rent BMI, and caloric intake, the antioxidant index and caro-
tene index were positively associated with ALSFRS-R score
(β [SE], 0.182 [0.093]; P = .05 and β [SE], 0.303 [0.193]; P = .03,
respectively) and with percentage FVC (β [SE], 0.773 [0.325];
P = .02 and β [SE], 1.08 [0.486]; P = .03, respectively; Table 2).
There was no significant difference between the results of the
antioxidant and carotene indices and ALSFRS-R score or per-
centage FVC based on whether patients reported eating prob-
lems early in the course of the disease and occasional chok-
ing at the baseline visit.
Regression analysis for individual nutrients and ALSFRS-R
score and percentage FVC after controlling for age, sex, cur-
rent BMI, duration of symptoms, and dietary caloric intake
value of individual nutrients can be found in the eTable in the
Supplement. Because there are strong correlations between
these individual nutrients (r = 0.40-0.96; P < .01), it is not pos-
sible to determine the actual nutrients with the strongest as-
sociations; therefore, WQS regression analysis was used.
Table 3 shows the direction of the β coefficient and P val-
ues for WQS regression analyses. Detailed results from this
analysis are described below and in the Figure, which illus-
trates the estimated weights of each variable for the WQS re-
gression index for each nutrient or food, with larger weights
indicating a stronger contribution to the index.

Micronutrients and Macronutrients
AnempiricalWQSregressionindexofgoodmicronutrientswas
positively associated with ALSFRS-R score (β [SE], 2.7 [0.69];
P < .001), with 91% of the weight associated with 9 of 18 nu-
trients (Table 3 and Figure, A). Similarly, the WQS regression
for good micronutrients associated with percentage FVC was
positive (β [SE], 12.1 [2.8]; P < .001) (Table 3); however, 80%
of the weights were concentrated on 6 nutrients (lycopene, ω-3
fatty acids, ω-6 fatty acids, isoflavones, and fiber from both
vegetables and grains) (Figure, A).
The empirical WQS regression indices developed for bad
micronutrients were not significantly associated with either
outcome variable. The empirical WQS regression indices de-
veloped for macronutrients were not significantly associated
with ALSFRS-R score or percentage FVC (Table 3).
Food Groups
An empirical WQS regression index of good food groups was
positively associated with ALSFRS-R score (β [SE], 2.9 [0.9];
P = .001) (Table 3), with 71% of the weight associated with
fruit, eggs, fish, poultry, nuts and seeds, beneficial oils, and
other vegetables (Figure, B). The WQS regression index of
good food groups was also positively associated with per-
centage FVC (β [SE], 11.5 [3.4]; P < .001) (Table 3), with
weights similar to those for ALSFRS-R: yogurt, fruits, fish,
poultry, nuts and seeds, beneficial oils, and other vegetables
(Figure, B).
The empirical WQS regression index of bad food groups
was negatively and significantly associated with ALSFRS-R
score (β [SE], –1.6 [0.53]; P = .002) (Table 3). The primary com-
ponent was milk, with 50% of the weight, as well as beef and
pork (11%) and lunch meats (32%) (Figure, C). There was no as-
sociation with percentage FVC.
Exploratory Analyses With WQS Regression
When selected beneficial vitamins and minerals were consid-
ered, the WQS regression index had a positive and significant
association with ALSFRS-R score (β [SE], 1.5 [0.61]; P = .02).
Five vitamins held 95% of the weight (niacin, vitamin B6,
vitamin K, selenium, and glutathione). A similar WQS regres-
sion index was positive and significantly associated with per-
centage FVC (β [SE], 5.2 [2.2]; P = .02), with 85% of the
weight from vitamin B6, riboflavin, vitamin E, vitamin K, and
glutathione.

Discussion
In the longitudinal ALS COSMOS study, we analyzed the cross-
sectional data of dietary variables and ALS function at baseline
(as ALSFRS-R score and percentage FVC). Our results indicate
that greater intakes of antioxidant nutrients and foods high in
carotenoidsappeartobeassociatedwithbetterfunctionatstudy
entry. Weighted quantile sum regression allows for the analy-
sisofcombinationsofnutrientsandfoodgroupscomparedwith
the typical evaluation of single nutrients that cannot be per-
formed owing to strong collinearity between all nutrients.
Weighted quantile sum regression determines an empirically
weightedquantilesumindexassociatingasetofnutrientswith
specificoutcomevariables,inthiscaseALSFRS-Rscoreandper-
centage FVC. The 2 most highly weighted micronutrients as-
sociated with ALSFRS-R score were nutrients believed to be
strong antioxidants: lutein and zeaxanthin (15%) and ω-3 fatty
acids (18%); the dominant components associated with per-
centage FVC were ω-3 fatty acids (19%), ω-6 fatty acids (23%),
and fiber from grains and vegetables and fruit (9% and 14%, re-
spectively). The primary components from the analyses of the
goodfoodgroupwereeggs(19%associatedwithwithALSFRS-R
score),fish,poultry,beneficialoils,andvegetables.Thesefoods
supply antioxidants and are typically associated with a healthy
diet.Ontheotherhand,milk(50%)andlunchmeats(32%)were
highlyweightedinanegativeassociationwithALSFRS-Rscore,
perhaps a result of the higher fat intake and the potential for
these foods to promote oxidative stress.
There were some limitations in this study and only asso-
ciations, not cause and effect, can be found in this cross-
sectional analysis. Ideally, WQS regression is performed on 2
independent data sets—one to build the WQS regression in-
dex through bootstrap sampling, and the second to test the sig-
nificance of the signal from the created index. In our analy-
sis, the sample size of 302 was not considered large enough
to split the data into a discovery data set and a validation data
set. Therefore, weights were estimated in the same data used
to test for significance. In addition, data were collected with
an FFQ as an attempt to measure dietary habits over time, but
this method may not always represent true daily diets. Al-
though the caloric intake may be slightly underreported with
the use of an FFQ,37 the ranking of caloric and nutrient intake
will be accurate. There are only limited data on which nutri-
ents are associated with the development of ALS or are asso-
ciated with progression of ALS. Our groupings of good and bad
foods and nutrients were based on existing knowledge of ALS
and general dietary knowledge.5-14,16-20 However, if we incor-
rectly assigned a nutrient or food type to a nutrient group, it
will have a very small weight in the WQS regression, minimiz-
ing the error from nutrient grouping.
A strength of this study was the relatively large sample
size of patients with ALS who appear representative of all
eligible patients at the ALS centers, improving generalizabil-
ity. To our knowledge, this is also one of the first studies to
evaluate diet in association with measures of ALS function
near the time of diagnosis. The consistency of the findings
using 2 different statistical methods adds strength.
Although we used cross-sectional data for this analysis, we
intend to include the 24-month data on both dietary intake
and progression of ALS in future analyses when those data
are available. Longitudinal data will be important to confirm

of nutrition in the progression of ALS.
Several nutrients have been proposed to be associated
with the development of ALS, although the data are largely
inconsistent.5-11,13,14,38Fitzgeraldetal14suggestedthatfattyacid
composition of cell plasma membranes might modulate oxi-
dative stress responses, excitotoxicity, and inflammation, fac-
tors hypothesized to be associated with ALS.39 Polyunsatu-
rated fatty acid intake may also be associated with body fat,
which also appears to protect against ALS.40,41
We found that milk intake may have a negative affect on
ALSfunction(assessedbyALSFRS-RscoreandpercentageFVC)
at study entry. Milk-based supplements are used for patients
with ALS and were reported to lead to weight gain, improved
biochemistry, and a slower decline in ALSFRS-R score based
on a 4-month study of only 16 patients with ALS.42 It will be
important to see how dairy and milk intake are associated with
changes in ALSFRS-R score and mortality in the longitudinal
follow-up of the ALS COSMOS population.
Although previous studies have associated the intake of
severalhealthynutrientsandfoodswithreducedriskofALS,4-13
forthefirsttime,toourknowledge,wehaveshownthathealthy
nutrientsandantioxidantsareassociatedwithbetterALSfunc-
tion around the time of diagnosis. Therefore, nutritional care
of the patient with ALS might include not only caloric man-
agement but also promotion of fruit and vegetable intake.
