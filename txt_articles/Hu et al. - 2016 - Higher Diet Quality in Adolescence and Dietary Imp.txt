Abstract
Objectives—To examine the previously validated A Priori Diet Quality Score (APDQS), and 
weight change among adolescents transitioning into young adulthood.
Study design—Young people were recruited in middle/high schools and followed for 10 years. 
Participants reported diet and weight in 1999 (mean age 15 years), 2004 (20 years) and 2009 (25 
years). The analytic sample (n=2,656) had dietary intake assessments in 1999 and at least one 
other assessment. The APDQS (without alcoholic items) was based on 13 beneficial, 12 adverse, 
and 9 neutral food groups to capture aspects of Mediterranean/prudent diets, focusing on foods 
that are varied, based on nutritionally-rich plants, and less processed.
Results—From mean age 15 to 25, mean (SD) weight increased from 61.0 (14.7) to 76.1 (18.8) 
kg, and APDQS increased from 43.1 (11.1) to 45.6 (10.7) kg. Within-person tracking correlation 
of the APDQS was 0.35 from mean age 15 to 20 years, increasing to 0.49 from 20 to 25 years. 
Independent of lifestyle factors and energy intake, a 15-point (interquartile-range) higher APDQS 
in 1999 was associated with 1.5 kg (95% CI: 0.7, 2.3) less weight gain over 10 years; increase in 
APDQS over time was similarly associated with less concurrent weight gain. Findings were 
stronger for models of excess weight gain.
Conclusions—Higher diet quality, based on an assessment of dietary patterns in and after 
adolescence, was associated with reduced weight gain during the next 10 years. Establishment of 
high-quality dietary patterns in adolescence may help mitigate excess weight gain by young 
adulthood.

 Currently, the prevalence of obesity is double in Americans aged 2–19 and aged 19–40 
compared with what it was 2–3 decades ago, suggesting significant weight gain occurring 
during childhood/adolescence and young adulthood (1, 2). Weight gain during adolescence 
and young adulthood is associated with elevated metabolic risk factors later in life (3, 4). 
Adolescence and young adulthood are “critical periods” during which dietary patterns may 
be established that persist through adulthood, impacting weight status and health risk 
throughout adulthood (5, 6). Greater understanding of the contributors to weight gain during 
this critical period is needed.
Although dietary modification with a single diet focus (e.g., calorie or fat restriction) has 
been effective for moderate weight loss in middle age, such a strategy has been ineffective 
thus far in youth (7–9). Given the possible combined or synergistic effects of dietary 
compounds in foods, examination of diet as a whole may carry added information about 
weight gain over time and potentially promote effective interventions (10). The A Priori Diet 
Quality Score (APDQS) is food-based, reflects overall diet quality, and captures aspects of 
Mediterranean/prudent diets. It emphasizes reducing consumption of processed foods, red 
meat, sweet/salty foods, and whole fat dairy, while increasing consumption of seeds, white 
meat, plants and low-fat dairy, in the context of maintaining energy balance over the long 
run (11, 12). The APDQS has limited within-person variation, tracking strongly over time 
(12–15).
This score has been related to weight change in young adulthood and in middle age, 
independent of energy intake and physical activity (11, 13, 15); nonetheless, little is known 
about the APDQS in relation to weight gain during the transition from adolescence to young 
adulthood. Learning more about how the quality of one’s dietary intake and dietary patterns 
in adolescence predict weight gain through young adulthood is important for designing 
interventions aimed at excessive weight gain prevention for children, adolescents, and 
families. We hypothesized that the APDQS tracks through late adolescence into young 
adulthood, and that improved diet quality, as assessed by the APDQS, is associated with less 
weight gain among a large, diverse group of adolescents transitioning into young adulthood.
METHODS
Project EAT (Eating and Activity in Teens and Young Adults) is a longitudinal study 
examining lifestyle and weight in adolescents followed for 10 years (16, 17). In 1998–1999 
(EAT-I; mean age 15 years), adolescents from 31 public middle/high schools from urban and 
suburban school districts in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota were 
included. Among these students, those who were absent from school on the days of survey 
administration or who did not read English were excluded. Participants completed surveys 
and anthropometric measures at baseline, and completed follow-up surveys in 2004 (EAT-II; 
mean age 20) and 2009 (EAT-III; mean age 25). All study protocols used in Projects EAT-I, 
II, and III were approved by The University of Minnesota’s Institutional Review Board 
Human Subjects Committee. In 1999, consent procedures were done in accordance with the 
requests of the participating school districts; passive consent procedures were utilized in

 some schools and active consent procedures were required in others. For follow-up exams, 
consent was implied by returning the survey by mail or submitting it online.
Weight and height were self-reported in Projects EAT-I, II, and III. In a subset of EAT-I, self-
reports were highly correlated with measured weight and body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) 
among 1,936 boys and 1,861 girls (Weight: r=0.96 for boys and r=0.94 for girls; BMI: 
r=0.89 for boys and r=0.85 for girls) (18). In EAT-III, high correlations between self-
reported and measured BMI were also found in a validation subsample of 63 and 62 young 
adult men and women (r=0.95 for men and r=0.98 for women).
Dietary intake was self-reported at EAT-I and II using the 152-item Youth and Adolescent 
Food Frequency Questionnaire (YAQ), which is based on the Willett Food Frequency 
Questionnaire (FFQ), with modifications to include foods commonly consumed by children/
adolescents (19, 20). One-year reproducibility coefficients for energy-adjusted nutrient 
intake had a mean of 0.41 and the average correlation coefficient between energy-adjusted 
nutrient intake determined from the 24-hour dietary recalls and the average of the two YAQs 
was 0.45 (19, 20). Dietary intake was assessed at EAT-III using the 151-item 2007 grid form 
of the Willett FFQ (21). One-year reproducibility coefficients for unadjusted nutrient intake 
ranged from 0.47–0.80 (22). The average correlation coefficient between energy-adjusted 
nutrient intake determined from the 24-hour dietary recalls and the FFQ was 0.59 (22).
The APDQS was derived from YAQ food groups at mean ages 15 and 20 and FFQ at mean 
age 25 (14). Following the food grouping structure used in the Coronary Artery Risk 
Development in Young Adults Study (except for omitting alcohol items in view the pediatric 
age range of EAT-I and some EAT-II participants), we considered 34 food groups 
encompassing most aspects of diet among which 13 were rated beneficial, 9 neutral and 12 
adverse (14) (Table I). A higher score indicates a diet with better quality. The APDQS at 
EAT-III was calculated as the sum of quintile scores 0 to 4 for beneficial foods plus scores in 
the reverse order (4 to 0) for adverse foods (neutral foods affect the score indirectly by 
affecting the amounts of beneficial and adverse foods while maintaining energy balance). In 
foods with a large subset of non-consumers, the non-consumer group was scored 0 and 
quartiles among consumers were scored 1 to 4. One APDQS point reflects a one-category 
change in one food group. To enhance the comparability between scores over time, the 
APDQS at EAT-I and II used cut-off points based on the distribution of APDQS in EAT-III 
for scoring.
Daily intake of energy and nutrients was determined based on the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture’s Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (release 19). Among 34 food groups 
in common between the YAQ and the FFQ, 14 were virtually identical and 20 were based on 
comparable questions. In a validation study (N=194) of our participants who completed both 
YAQ and FFQ at EAT III, correlation coefficients between YAQ and FFQ intake estimates of 
energy and food groups ranged from 0.49 to 0.62, and the percentage of individuals 
classified into the same quartile rank category based on their responses to the YAQ and FFQ 
were over 50% for major food groups (23).

 Covariates
Baseline family socioeconomic status (SES) was a five-point scale based primarily on 
parental education level, emphasizing the higher level of either parent (24). In each EAT 
exam, unhealthful weight control behaviors during the past year intended to lose weight or 
keep from gaining weight included ‘fasted’, ‘ate very little food’, ‘used a food substitute 
(powder or special drink)’, ‘skipped meals’, ‘smoked more cigarettes’, ‘took diet pills’, 
‘made myself vomit’, ‘used laxatives’, and ‘used diuretics’ (test-retest agreement=83%) 
(25). Smoking frequency during the past year was categorized as ’never’, ‘a few times’, 
‘monthly’, ‘weekly’, or ‘daily’ (test-retest r=0.91). Total hours of physical activity included 
hours spent on strenuous, moderate, and mild exercise (test-retest r=0.80).
Statistical Analyses
At baseline, 4,746 students were enrolled, and 2,901 participated in at least one follow-up 
exam. Of the 2,901, data from 245 participants were excluded because they either lacked or 
provided inadequate or implausible data on dietary intake (>7,000 kcal/d or <400 kcal/d). 
After these exclusions, data from 2,656 (1,226 male, 1,633 white) participants were included 
in our analysis. Mean weight or age in our sample was not different from that in those who 
were not included.
We assessed APDQS per 15 units in this analysis because interquartile range of baseline 
APDQS was 13 and interquartile range of change in ADPQS over 10 years was about 15 
(Table I). We examined the association of the continuous APDQS in 1998–99 with 
subsequent changes in BMI and weight using mixed-effects repeated measures regression 
models. Each repeated measures model consisted of a random intercept to account for the 
within-participant correlation (Toeplitz (banded) variance-covariance structure) over the 
observed longitudinal data. To examine weight change over 10 years, we included indicator 
variables for time (0, 5, and 10 years), the APDQS, and an interaction term for the APDQS 
by time, baseline age, sex, race, SES, cigarette smoking frequency, total energy intake, use 
of unhealthy weight control behavior, and total hours of physical activity. We also examined 
the associations between changes in continuous APDQS and concurrent change in BMI or 
weight using similar models. In secondary analyses, we examined the associations excluding 
328 participants with childhood obesity at baseline (26). We replicated analysis using excess 
weight gain as the outcome, defined as actual weight gain minus upper limit of normal 
weight gain, and also performed the analysis by BMI status at age 15 (normal weight, 
overweight or obese) (26). Age and sex-specific upper limits of normal weight gain were 
modeled as 10-year weight change in EAT participants whose BMI at EAT-III (mean age 25 
y) was ≥22 kg/m2, and the estimates through age 20 were similar to those obtained using the 
CDC standards (Table II). Effect modification by sex and ethnicity/race was assessed. All 
analyses were performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Mean weight increased from 61.0 kg (SD=14.7) to 76.1 kg (SD=18.8) during the transition 
from mean age 15 to 25, and mean BMI increased from 22.1 kg/m2 (SD=4.2) to 26.0 kg/m2 
(SD=5.6). Concurrently, mean APDQS increased from 43.1 (SD=11.1) to 45.6 (SD=10.7)

 (Table I). Prevalence was 15.5% overweight and 9.8% obese, 13.5% overweight and 10.1% 
obese, and 21.7% overweight and 13.0% obese in males at EAT-I, II, and III, respectively. 
Corresponding prevalence for females was 15.7% and 7.2%, 17.1% and 8.7%, and 18.7% 
and 13.6%, respectively. The within-person tracking correlation coefficient of APDQS with 
itself was 0.35 from mean age 15 to 20, and 0.49 from mean age 20 to 25.
In 1999, participants in higher APDQS quintiles were more likely to be female, less likely to 
be smokers, had higher levels of mean SES, physical activity, and tended to use unhealthy 
weight control behaviors (Table III). In 2009, associations across quintiles of the APDQS 
were qualitatively similar, with the addition that higher quintile participants were more 
likely white and similar levels of physical activity. Total energy intake was similar between 
1999 and 2009. Intake of selected nutrients and a detailed listing of the food groups 
contributing to low, moderate, and high APDQS quintiles important for understanding the 
APDQS in food terms was provided (Table IV; available at www.jpeds.com).
Body weight did not differ cross-sectionally by diet quality at age 15, but weight gain was 
2.2 kg (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0, 3.3) less by mean age 25 in those whose APDQS 
was above vs. below median (APDQS=45) at mean age 15. Furthermore, those whose 
baseline APDQS was above median and whose APDQS improved (APDQS change >0) 
gained 5.7 kg (95% CI: 3.7, 7.7) less than those whose baseline APDQS was below median 
and whose APDQS worsened (APDQS change ≤0) (Figure 1). Findings were similar for 
BMI (Table V); height change was not associated with APDQS (data not shown).
After adjustment for the aforementioned covariates, a 15-unit higher APDQS at mean age 15 
was associated with less weight gain [predicted change (95% CI): −1.5 kg (−2.3, −0.7), P< 
0.001] and less increase in BMI [−0.47 kg/m2 (−0.72, −0.22), P< 0.001] over 10 years 
(Table VI). A 15-unit increase in APDQS from mean age 15 to 25 was associated with less 
concurrent weight gain [−1.9 kg (−2.4, −1.4), P< 0.001] and less concurrent BMI increase 
[−0.53 kg/m2 (−0.69, 0.36), P< 0.001] (Table VII). Similar results were observed in all 
secondary/sensitivity analyses. Results were similar by sex or ethnicity/race (data not 
shown). In analyses of excess weight gain between average ages 15 and 25, a 15-unit higher 
APDQS at baseline [−2.3 kg (−3.0, −1.5), P<0.001] and a 15-unit greater increase in 
APDQS over 10 years [−2.1 kg (−2.8, −1.5), P<0.001] were associated with less excess 
weight gain (Table VIII). Similar predictions were observed for excess BMI gain. Excess 
weight or BMI gain per 15 units of APDQS was greater for those who were overweight or 
obese at average age 15 than for those who were normal weight at average age 15 (Table 
VIII).
DISCUSSION
We found that both higher diet quality (as represented by higher APDQS) in adolescence 
and improvement in diet quality over subsequent years are associated with less weight gain 
during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood, independent of energy intake, 
eating behavior, physical activity and cigarette smoking. Similar findings for the subgroup of 
initially non-obese participants from our data suggest that improving diet quality in 
adolescence may be an effective strategy for the primary prevention of obesity. Associations

 of APDQS and weight gain were stronger in models of excess weight gain. Furthermore, the 
APDQS tracks more closely from late adolescence into young adulthood than from early to 
late adolescence. The extent of increase in diet quality for which there is clinically important 
effectiveness for reducing extra weight gain, e.g., 15 score points (interquartile range) 
higher, is achievable. Increase in the APDQS can be achieved by increasing intakes of seeds 
(beans, coffee, whole grain, nuts), white meat (fish, poultry), plants (tea, fruit, vegetable) 
and low-fat dairy, while decreasing intakes of processed foods, red meat, sweet and salty 
foods (salty snack, soft drink, sweet bread, grain dessert), and whole fat dairy. This dietary 
pattern emphasizes dietary variety (no one food group contributes many points), allows 
flexibility in choosing among food groups, and makes a maintained, healthy and enjoyable 
dietary plan possible to avoid gaining excess weight. In addition, the APDQS may be seen as 
a collection of diet patterns developed on a single conceptual base rather, than a single 
optimal diet that applies in all situations. This potentially increases its applicability to 
different populations and settings.
Our findings with regard to the APDQS and weight gain are consistent with several studies 
that examined the association between the Mediterranean dietary pattern and weight change 
among middle-aged adults (27–29). Lassale et al tested six a priori dietary scores, each 
including 9 to 20 food components, and reported that most of these dietary scores were 
associated with weight change among French male adults 45 years and older after 
adjustment for energy intake (30). The APDQS was applied to a clinical trial to represent the 
randomized diet treatment and was associated with weight loss in late middle age (11). In 
another study, which also used data from Project EAT, Cutler et al examined the relationship 
between individual food groups and weight changes in adolescents (31). In that study, the 
dietary patterns were identified a posteriori using principal component analysis; their 
associations with weight gain were weaker than the associations observed in our study (31). 
Unlike that previous analysis, our analysis is rather focused on a dietary pattern that has 
been defined a priori, whereas the data-driven dietary patterns may be seen as more an 
‘exploration’ for a healthy or unhealthy diet. As appropriate to a study of adolescents, our 
dietary pattern did not include alcoholic items, unlike the adult version of the APDQS. The 
limited published data available linking the APDQS with BMI during young-to-mid 
adulthood are in accordance with our findings (13, 32).
Because the APDQS is based on current knowledge about the role of food in the prevention 
of obesity and cardiovascular disease, ratings may be subject to alteration using emerging 
information on the hypothesized health effects of specific individual foods, or even subject 
to differences of opinion among experts. The effects of a few food groups have been 
debated, such as for refined grains, starchy foods, fruit juice, and dairy foods (33–36). 
Nonetheless, the APDQS is likely a relatively stable and robust characteristic compared with 
individual food groups in that increase in the APDQS is unlikely to be achieved by changing 
consumption of single foods. Future studies should systematically and quantitatively 
“deconstruct” the APDQS, to learn about the separate impact of individual components or 
subsets of food groups.
Strengths of this analysis include a large, diverse population with data over three time points 
that allows us to examine longitudinal changes in diet and weight during the transitional

 period between adolescence and young adulthood. However, this analysis is subject to some 
limitations. Self-reported weight and BMI were used. However, in a validation study in 
Project EAT participants, these measurements were highly correlated with measured weight 
and BMI (18). The use of an altered questionnaire at mean age 25 is a methodological 
challenge due to somewhat inconsistent content between the YAQ and the FFQ. We were 
able to match foods fairly closely between the YAQ and the FFQ. Our results showed that 
the tracking correlation between mean ages 20 and 25 (YAQ to FFQ) was higher than the 
tracking correlation between mean ages 15 and 20 (YAQ to YAQ). We suspect that the 
APDQS within person correlation between mean ages 20 and 25 would have been even 
higher if the same questionnaire had been used in both surveys. Because absolute levels 
were relatively less in the concurrent YAQ, using the FFQ cut-off points in 2009 may put 
YAQ responses in the lower scores of the APDQS. Nonetheless, the APDQS still increased 
from mean age 15 to 20. As with any assessment of dietary intake, underreporting and 
invalid reporting of usual diet may occur for the YAQ and FFQ. Because social desirability 
bias is possible, adolescents who gained more weight may tend to report they ate less and 
better than they actually did, which would result in potential underestimation of the 
relationship between diet and weight gain. Although this analysis has extensively adjusted 
for potential confounders including demographics, lifestyle factors and weight control 
behaviors, as with other observational studies, the possibility of residual confounding cannot 
be eliminated.
In conclusion, establishing a high quality diet early in life may be important because both 
higher APDQS in adolescence and increasing APDQS from adolescence to young adulthood 
predicted less weight and BMI increases over 10 years, compared with lower or decreasing 
APDQS. Establishing such a dietary pattern in adolescence is important for prevention of 
excessive weight gain, despite body weight and BMI not being related to APDQS at mean 
age 15. Furthermore, the dietary pattern begins to track as strongly as physical risk factors 
for cardiovascular disease like blood pressure starting in late adolescence. Future prevention 
intervention of weight gain should consider this dietary pattern as it is more acceptable and 
easier to adhere to compared with change in consumption of individual foods.

Predicted weight gain by baseline and change in the A Priori Diet Quality Score (APDQS) 
levels. Adjusted for baseline age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, smoking status, energy 
intake, use of unhealthy weight control behavior, and total hours of physical activity. The top 
row indicates the epidemiologic design/analysis in each column. The two middle rows report 
how weight changed in participants whose APDQS at baseline was below vs above the 
median APDQS of 44 during the study. The bottom row provides interpretation of findings 
at each stage of the study.

Table II
Sample sizes and distributional features of change in Body Mass Index (BMI, kg/m2) between the EAT I survey at average age 15 and the EAT III survey 
10 years later at average age 25, among participants whose BMI was <22 kg/m2 in the EAT III survey, by sex and age in the EAT I survey. These BMI 
change values were converted to upper limits of normal body weight gain (kg) values by multiplying by the square of the average of height (m) across 
EAT I, EAT II, and EAT III. In this computation, a single female aged 11 years was pooled with the 12-year old females.

This method gave estimates of normal weight gain which were similar to those obtained using the CDC standards, but the CDC standards were available only through age 20. Then we characterized excess 
weight gain as actual weight gain minus normal weight gain. After that, we repeated analysis using excess weight gain as the outcome, and also performed the analysis subgrouped by BMI status at age 15 
(normal weight, overweight or obese).

Excess weight or BMI gain was defined as actual gain minus normal gain; Normal gain was determined based on Table II, online. Predicted changes were based on general linear regression models 
including both baseline level of and change in APDQS, adjusted for age, gender, race, baseline weight, and change in socioeconomic status, cigarette smoking status, total energy intake, use of unhealthy 
weight control behavior, and total hours of physical activity. Predicted changes are per 15-units of APDQS representing the interquartile range.
