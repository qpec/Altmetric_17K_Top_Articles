Purpose
The prevalence and features of treatment-emergent small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer
(t-SCNC) are not well characterized in the era of modern androgen receptor (AR)–targeting therapy.
We sought to characterize the clinical and genomic features of t-SCNC in a multi-institutional
prospective study.
Methods
Patients with progressive, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) underwent
metastatic tumor biopsy and were followed for survival. Metastatic biopsy specimens underwent
independent, blinded pathology review along with RNA/DNA sequencing.
Results
A total of 202 consecutive patients were enrolled. One hundred forty-eight (73%) had prior disease
progression on abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. The biopsy evaluable rate was 79%. The overall
incidence of t-SCNC detection was 17%. AR amplification and protein expression were present in
67% and 75%, respectively, of t-SCNC biopsy specimens. t-SCNC was detected at similar
proportions in bone, node, and visceral organ biopsy specimens. Genomic alterations in the DNA
repair pathway were nearly mutually exclusive with t-SCNC differentiation (P = .035). Detection of
t-SCNC was associated with shortened overall survival among patients with prior AR-targeting
therapy for mCRPC (hazard ratio, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.07 to 3.82). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
of the transcriptome identified a small-cell–like cluster that further enriched for adverse survival
outcomes (hazard ratio, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.25 to 7.19). A t-SCNC transcriptional signature was
developed and validated in multiple external data sets with . 90% accuracy. Multiple tran-
scriptional regulators of t-SCNC were identified, including the pancreatic neuroendocrine marker
PDX1.
Conclusion
t-SCNC is present in nearly one fifth of patients with mCRPC and is associated with shortened
survival. The near-mutual exclusivity with DNA repair alterations suggests t-SCNC may be a distinct
subset of mCRPC. Transcriptional profiling facilitates the identification of t-SCNC and novel ther-
apeutic targets.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the most common incident
cancer in men in developed countries and the
eighth leading cause of cancer death globally.1 The
introduction of highly potent androgen receptor
(AR)–targeting therapies such as abiraterone and
enzalutamide for the treatment of metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has
provided significant clinical benefit.2,3
In a subset of patients, therapeutic resis-
tance to AR-targeting therapy is accompanied
by the emergence of a histologic subtype that
morphologically resembles de novo small-cell
prostate cancer, a highly aggressive histologic

 variant present in , 1% of untreated prostate cancers at the time
of diagnosis.4 It is not clear if the treatment-emergent variant,
variously labeled neuroendocrine prostate cancer and aggressive
variant,5,6 is the same disease entity as de novo small-cell prostate
cancer. We have termed this histology treatment-emergent small-
cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer or t-SCNC. Previous reports
have sought to characterize t-SCNC but have been limited by the
availability of prospectively collected tissue from a consecutive
series of patients with sufficient follow-up to characterize in-
cidence of t-SCNC and clinical outcomes.7,8
To understand the prevalence and characteristics of this
treatment-emergent variant, and to provide a basis for tumor
classification, clinical recommendations, and future development
of therapies, we undertook a multi-institutional prospective study
to perform biopsy of metastases from consecutively enrolled pa-
tients with progressive mCRPC.
METHODS
Patients and Study Design
A
prospective
IRB-approved
trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier:
NCT02432001) was conducted at five consortium sites. Eligibility criteria
included progressive mCPRC by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working
Group 2 criteria,9 prior histologic evidence of adenocarcinoma of the
prostate gland, at least one bone or soft tissue metastasis amenable to biopsy,
and written informed consent. Patients were prospectively followed for
overall survival. Treatment post biopsy specimen acquisition was per in-
vestigator discretion. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), lactate de-
hydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, hemoglobin, neuron-specific enolase
(NSE), and chromogranin A (CGA) levels were measured at the time of
biopsy. Repeat tumor biopsy at progression was optional.
Tissue Acquisition and Pathology Evaluation
Metastatic biopsy tissue was acquired via image-guided core needle
biopsy as previously described.10 Separate needle core biopsies of the same
metastatic lesion were snap frozen and formalin fixed/paraffin embedded
(FFPE), respectively. Tumor RNA from frozen specimens was amplified
and sequenced for gene expression analyses. FFPE biopsy specimens were
evaluated by three experienced pathologists (G.T., J.H., L.T.) blinded to the
clinical and genomic features for determination of consensus pathologic
subclassification into three categories (pure small-cell morphology, mixed
biopsy specimens with discrete regions of t-SCNC and adenocarcinoma, or
biopsy specimens without any small-cell features), using recently described
classification criteria (Data Supplement).11 Because the diagnosis of
t-SCNC is based on morphologic criteria, immunohistochemical staining
for chromogranin, CD56, or synaptophysin was not routinely per-
formed.11 Next-generation targeted genomic sequencing of FFPE tissue
was performed as previously described.12
Transcriptional Analysis and Clustering
For the unsupervised gene expression analysis, complete-linkage
clustering was performed. The 5,000 most varying protein-coding HUGO
Gene Nomenclature Committee genes13 were selected to compute sample-
to-sample gene expression correlation values as distance metric for the
hierarchical clustering. The resulting sample tree was cut into five clusters.
Analysis of variance for the five sample clusters was performed, and 528
genes had an false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P , .05.
Master regulator analysis was performed using the MARINa algo-
rithm implemented via the viper R package.14,15 MARINa infers candidate
master regulators (MRs) between two groups of samples on the basis of the

scores were computed with the VIPER function and visualized using
TumorMap.16
t-SCNC Signature Development and Validation
RNA-Seq data from 18,538 protein-coding HUGO Gene Nomen-
clature Committee genes were used to distinguish t-SCNC versus ade-
nocarcinoma. Samples with mixed histology were excluded from the
learning set. Leave-pair-out cross-validation was performed on 100 models
to determine model accuracy.17 The signature was subsequently applied to
mixed histology tumors as well as three external mCRPC data sets and the
primary prostate cancer data set of TCGA.7,8,18,19
Characterization of AR Expression and Signaling
AR protein expression was analyzed using immunohistochemical
(IHC) analysis (Androgen Receptor [C6F11] XP Rabbit mAb; Data
Supplement). To evaluate canonical AR transcriptional activity in each
biopsy specimen, an AR expression signature was developed based on 53
AR-positive cell lines in the presence and absence of androgen.20 The
derived classifier had . 90% concordance with a previously described AR
signature.21
Statistical Considerations
Comparison of the continuous variables among groups was assessed
by the two-sample t test, analysis of variance, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and
Kruskal-Wallis test, when normality assumption did or did not hold,
respectively.22-24 The statistical association between categorical variables
was evaluated by x2 and Fisher’s exact test.
Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of development of
mCRPC, as defined by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2
criteria, with the prespecified primary analysis in patients previously
treated with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. Kaplan-Meier product limit
method, log-rank, and Cox proportional hazards were used to characterize
the relationship between OS, histology subtype, and gene cluster.
Analyses pertaining to the incidence and clinical characteristics of
t-SCNC, DNA sequencing, and overall survival were conducted on a per-
patient basis, using the first evaluable biopsy. Baseline and progression
biopsy specimens, when available, were included as discrete samples for
gene and protein expression analyses.
RESULTS
Incidence of t-SCNC
Between December 2012 and April 2016, 202 patients with
mCRPC were enrolled and underwent a total of 249 metastatic
tumor biopsies. The median time from mCRPC to biopsy was
17.6 months (range, 0.1 to 212.6 months). Of 202 patients enrolled,
160 (79%) had sufficient tumor present in at least one biopsy
specimen to permit histologic classification. Bone metastases (n =
137) comprised 55% of all biopsy specimens, lymph node (n = 64)
26%, liver (n = 26) 10%, and other soft tissue (n = 22), 9% (Fig 1).
t-SCNC was found in 27 of 160 (17%) evaluable patients.
Twenty patients harbored tumors with pure small-cell histology,
and seven patients had mixed biopsy specimens with discrete

core (Fig 2; Data Supplement). The percentage of t-SCNC in the
seven mixed cases ranged from 20% to 80%. Detection of t-SCNC
was observed at similar proportions by biopsy site, including 14%,
19%, and 14% of evaluable liver, lymph node, and bone metastases,
respectively (P = .76).
Transcriptional Profile of t-SCNC
mRNA-Seq data were available from 119 baseline and pro-
gression biopsy specimens distributed across all organ sites (Fig 1),
including 21 tumors with t-SCNC histologic differentiation (pure
or mixed). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the tran-
scriptome identified a cluster of 12 cases (cluster 2) that was

 enriched for the presence of t-SCNC histologic differentiation (Fig
3A). Six of 14 (43%) pure t-SCNC tumors fell within cluster 2,
versus two of seven (26%) tumors with mixed histology versus four
of 90 (4%) tumors with pure adenocarcinoma (P , .001).
A supervised analysis identified 61 genes differentially expressed
between the t-SCNC–enriched cluster versus other clusters with
FDR-corrected P , .05 (Fig 3B). The topmost overexpressed genes
were transcriptional targets of E2F Transcription Factor 1 (E2F1;
negatively regulated by Retinoblastoma 1 [RB1]). RB1 loss signa-
ture25 scores were higher in the t-SCNC–enriched cluster (Data
Supplement). To further characterize the transcriptional hallmarks
of cluster 2, we used the MR Inference algorithm and visualized
results using TumorMap.14,16 Pancreatic-duodenal homeobox factor
1 (PDX1) was the topmost MR enriched in the t-SCNC cluster (P ,
.001; Fig 3C; Data Supplement). Achaete-Scute family BHLH
transcription factor 1 (ASCL1), E2F1, Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2),
and POU class 3 homeobox 2 (POU3F2) were also among the top
MRs in the t-SCNC cluster (P , .05 for all comparisons; Fig 3C;
Data Supplement).
A gene expression signature of t-SCNC was subsequently de-
veloped, with 91% internal accuracy on leave-pair-out cross-validation,
and enriched for presence of neural development genes, including
SEMA3, EPHA7, and TENM3 (Fig 3D). t-SCNC signature scores of
biopsy specimens with mixed histology are shown in the Data Sup-
plement. The t-SCNC signature was applied to three external mCRPC
data sets and correctly categorized neuroendocrine tumors with nearly
100% accuracy (Data Supplement).7,8,18 Finally, the t-SCNC signature
was applied to the TCGA database of primary tumors and correctly
classified all cases as possessing adenocarcinoma histology (Data
Supplement).19

 histology (Fig 4; Data Supplement). The prevalence of AR copy
number gain and/or activating point mutations was similarly
distributed across histologic groups (67% of t-SCNC biopsy
specimens v 51% of biopsy specimens without t-SCNC; P = .304).
Variants predicted to lead to loss of function in TP53 and/or RB1
were found in 10 of 12 patients with t-SCNC (83%) compared with
25 of 73 (34%) patients who did not harbor t-SCNC on biopsy (P =
.0015). The presence of deleterious mutations and/or copy number
loss in DNA repair pathway genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CDK12,
RAD51, PALB2, FANCA, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MLH3, and
MSH6) was almost entirely mutually exclusive with t-SCNC tu-
mors (1 of 12 [8%] t-SCNC biopsy specimens v 29 of 73 [40%]
biopsy specimens without t-SCNC; P = .0350; Fig 4).
AR Expression and Activity
A total of 106 FFPE biopsy specimens were stained for AR
expression (Fig 2; Data Supplement). In the overall cohort, 2+/3+
nuclear AR expression by IHC and AR amplification were both
positively associated with higher AR transcriptional signature score
(Data Supplement). Of 20 t-SCNC specimens, 15 (75%) demon-
strated 2+/3+ nuclear AR staining, compared with 75 of 86 (87%)
adenocarcinoma (P = .170). The t-SCNC biopsy specimens without
strong nuclear AR staining had similar clinical features to the overall
t-SCNC cohort and fell within cluster 2 of the unsupervised
transcriptional analysis (Fig 3A). AR transcriptional activity was
lower in tumors with t-SCNC histology (median scores of the pure
t-SCNC, mixed, and not t-SCNC samples were 22.12, 21.10,

Clinical and Genomic Characterization of t-SCNC

 and 20.24, respectively; P = .017) and was lower in cluster 2 versus
other clusters (Data Supplement). Serum PSA and tissue KLK3
expression were not correlated (Pearson’s coefficient of determi-
nation, 0.0045).
Clinical Characteristics of t-SCNC
Baseline characteristics of the overall patient cohort at the
time of biopsy are summarized in Table 1 and were comparable
between the evaluable (n = 160) and inevaluable patients (n = 42).
Nearly three fourths of the patients had developed resistance to
abiraterone (n = 82; 40%), enzalutamide (n = 20; 10%), or both
(n = 46; 23%) at study entry.
The majority of clinical characteristics, except for serum
lactate dehydrogenase, were similar in patients harboring t-SCNC
histology (whether pure or mixed) compared with those who did
not (Table 1; Data Supplement). Median time from mCRPC to
study entry, serum PSA, Gleason score at time of diagnosis, and
sites of metastases were not significantly different in patients with
t-SCNC. A comparison of the clinical features of the t-SCNC
subset with two independent neuroendocrine prostate cancer
cohorts5,8 is shown in the Data Supplement.
Median serum NSE was higher in patients with t-SCNC (11.6
ng/mL v 7.1; P , .001); CGAwas not (median 7.8 ng/mL v 6.0; P =
.977). Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, if
serum NSE was . 6.05 ng/mL and CGA was . 3.1 ng/mL (present
in 55% of patients), the sensitivity, specificity, and negative and
positive predictive values for the detection of t-SCNC histology on
biopsy were 95%, 50%, 98%, and 22%, respectively.
Survival Outcomes by Histologic and Genomic
Subgroups
The median time from the time of development of mCRPC to
death was 42.1 months, with a median follow-up of 34.1 months
and 131 deaths observed. Median overall survival in the preplanned
analysis of patients with prior abiraterone and/or enzalutamide
treatment was significantly shorter in those with t-SCNC (median
OS from date of mCRPC = 44.5 v 36.6 months; hazard ratio [HR],
2.02; 95% CI, 1.07 to 3.82; Fig 5A). A post hoc sensitivity analysis
including treatment-na¨
ıve patients yielded similar results (Data
Supplement). Patients with mixed tumors had similarly reduced
survival as those with pure t-SCNC (median OS, 36.3 and 36.8 months,
respectively v 44.5 months in patients with adenocarcinoma; log-rank
P = .031). Patients whose biopsy fell within the small-cell–enriched
cluster 2 on unsupervised hierarchical clustering likewise had worse
survival (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.03 to 4.69; Fig 5B). When histology and
transcriptomic data were combined, patients with t-SCNC tumors
falling within cluster 2 had significantly shorter survival than the
patients without t-SCNC histology falling outside cluster 2, with
a greater separation of survival curves than either histologic or
genomic analysis alone (HR for overall survival, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.25
to 7.19; Fig 5C).
DISCUSSION
Widespread use of abiraterone and enzalutamide has had a
transformative impact in the management of advanced prostate
cancer, yet therapeutic resistance is a near-universal phenomenon,
frequently heralded by a more aggressive clinical course. t-SCNC
was identified in 17% of evaluable patients in our large, prospective
series of patients with mCRPC, suggesting that this is an important
mechanism in the development of treatment-resistant mCRPC.
The near-mutual exclusivity between t-SCNC differentiation and
presence of DNA repair mutations raises the intriguing possibility
of distinct subsets of mCRPC.
The identification of mixed histologic subtypes within a single
metastatic biopsy suggests that treatment-emergent small-cell
neuroendocrine differentiation is a heterogeneous process. Het-
erogeneity may also partially account for the divergence observed
between AR protein expression and inferred transcriptional ac-
tivity in a subset of t-SCNC biopsy specimens. Nevertheless,

 although patients in this study underwent biopsy of a single
metastatic site, and heterogeneity across different metastatic sites in
the same patient was not evaluated, t-SCNC identified on a single
biopsy, whether pure or mixed, was associated with shortened
survival. Transcriptional analysis identified a subset of patients
with particularly high-risk t-SCNC and had additional prognostic
utility when combined with histopathologic classification. Vali-
dation of these observations in independent cohorts, as they be-
come available, will be important.
The observed prevalence of t-SCNC is substantially higher
than de novo small-cell cancer of the prostate, which occurs in
, 1% of cases.4 This may reflect a transdifferentiation process after
androgen-ablating therapy.26 Classic de novo SCNC is an AR-null
phenotype, progressing with low serum PSA levels. In contrast,
in our series of t-SCNC cases, the majority of tumors had
high nuclear AR expression by IHC, and median serum PSA
was . 60 ng/mL. Visceral metastases are common in de novo
SCNC; in the current series, only approximately one third of
patients with t-SCNC histology had liver metastases. The overlap in
clinical features between patients with t-SCNC and adenocarci-
noma calls into question current practice guidelines recom-
mending metastatic biopsy to evaluate for small-cell differentiation
only in cases with aggressive phenotypic features.27
In the Robinson et al18 series, the incidence of tumors with
small-cell neuroendocrine differentiation was approximately 1%,
compared with 17% in the current study. This may in part reflect

 the prospective design of the current study with inclusion of
consecutively enrolled patients, in contrast to the characterization
of biopsy specimens obtained within a clinical trial network de-
scribed previously.18 In addition, enrollment in the current study
occurred at varying time points during the course of mCRPC, with
potential enrichment for patients at higher risk. Methodologic
differences in pathologic evaluation of FFPE versus frozen tissue
may also partially account for the difference in incidence between
the two series. Application of the t-SCNC expression signature to
other external data sets, as they become available, will provide
additional clarity regarding the incidence of t-SCNC.
The practical limitations in obtaining metastatic tumor tissue
from patients make the development of noninvasive biomarkers of
t-SCNC of critical importance. In this series, the serum neuro-
endocrine markers CGA and NSE had a high sensitivity (95%) and
negative predictive value (98%) for detecting t-SCNC but lacked
specificity. If independently validated, patients with normal serum
neuroendocrine markers, representing 45% of the patients in our

 series, may not require biopsies to detect t-SCNC. Circulating
tumor cells and imaging tools may yield additional diagnostic
utility in identifying t-SCNC and quantifying the degree of intra-
and intertumoral heterogeneity.28,29
Persistent nuclear ARexpression in the setting of lower predicted
canonical AR transcriptional activity, as observed in a subset of
t-SCNC biopsy specimens, suggests that AR may be under epigenetic
regulation of an alternative transcriptional program. This is consistent
with the observation that marked epigenetic differences exist between
CRPC with and without neuroendocrine differentiation.8 The po-
tential plasticity of the transdifferentiation process and persistent AR
expression in the setting of low canonical activity raises intriguing
therapeutic implications of restoring AR activity via application of
epigenetic modifiers such as enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)
inhibitors.30,31 These hypotheses warrant additional investigation.
The molecular pathogenesis of t-SCNC remains incompletely
defined but seems to arise in the context of TP53 and RB1 aberration
from adenocarcinoma under selective pressure of AR pathway in-
hibition.32 We observed frequent loss of TP53 and/or RB1 at the
genomic level, and upregulation of E2F, a hallmark of RB1 deficient
tumors. DEK, the highest overexpressed E2F1 target gene in the
t-SCNC–enriched cluster, has previously been implicated in the
progression to neuroendocrine prostate cancer.33 Among tumors
without small-cell differentiation, there exists a wide variability in
histologic appearance, with some cases demonstrating classic ade-
nocarcinoma features and other tumors with features suggestive of
neuroendocrine differentiation. Analysis of paired longitudinal bi-
opsies is ongoing to characterize this transitional disease state.
Despite the aggressive phenotypic features of t-SCNC, there is
no standard of care for the treatment of patients who harbor this
subtype. Master regulator analysis of the transcriptome identified
several additional transcriptional factors implicated in the pro-
gression to neuroendocrine prostate cancer, including EZH2, POU
class 3 homeobox 2 (BRN2), FOXA2, and ASCL1. FOXA2 has recently
been described as a molecular marker of small-cell neuroendocrine
prostate cancer.34 POU3F2, encoding the transcription factor BRN2,
was recently implicated in the progression to neuroendocrine
prostate cancer and inversely associated with AR expression.35 Direct
enzymatic inhibitors of EZH2 are currently under clinical evaluation
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02860286), as are drugs targeting
cell-surface proteins transcriptionally regulated by these factors (eg,
delta-like protein 3/ASCL1; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02709889).
The identification of PDX1, a Hox-type transcription factor that drives
neuroendocrine differentiation in the pancreas,36 as the most active
transcription factor in t-SCNC raises intriguing possibilities for pan–
small-cell diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. With novel therapies in
clinical development, there is the potential to improve disease outcomes
for this high-risk and increasingly prevalent subset of mCRPC.
