Abstract
Vocal folds are used as sound sources in various species, but it is unknown how vocal fold
morphologies are optimized for different acoustic objectives. Here we identify two main vari-
ables affecting range of vocal fold vibration frequency, namely vocal fold elongation and tis-
sue fiber stress. A simple vibrating string model is used to predict fundamental frequency
ranges across species of different vocal fold sizes. While average fundamental frequency is
predominantly determined by vocal fold length (larynx size), range of fundamental fre-
quency is facilitated by (1) laryngeal muscles that control elongation and by (2) nonlinearity
in tissue fiber tension. One adaptation that would increase fundamental frequency range is
greater freedom in joint rotation or gliding of two cartilages (thyroid and cricoid), so that
vocal fold length change is maximized. Alternatively, tissue layers can develop to bear a dis-
proportionate fiber tension (i.e., a ligament with high density collagen fibers), increasing the
fundamental frequency range and thereby vocal versatility. The range of fundamental fre-
quency across species is thus not simply one-dimensional, but can be conceptualized as
the dependent variable in a multi-dimensional morphospace. In humans, this could allow for
variations that could be clinically important for voice therapy and vocal fold repair. Alterna-
tive solutions could also have importance in vocal training for singing and other highly-
skilled vocalizations.
Author Summary
Mammals, birds, and reptiles vocalize (make sounds with vocal cords). Various species,
and individuals within the species, are identified by pitch, loudness, and other acoustic fea-
tures they can build into a repertoire of rhythmic and melodic patterns. Range of pitch, or
more precisely fundamental frequency, is required to produce a variety of patterns.
Whereas the average fundamental frequency is predictable by body size, the range of fun-
damental frequency depends on two different factors. The first is a freedom of movement
factor–how much vocal cord length change can be produced by muscles that rotate or

Introduction
A biological trait is usually the result of a trade-off between different selective forces and con-
straints [1]. Vocal behavior is no exception, and one important set of constraints is related to
the mechanism of sound production. In order to understand the design of vocal organs (larynx
and syrinx in vertebrates), investigators have often focused on size as the primary determining
factor of fundamental frequency and acoustic power produced by a sound source. In fact, a
number of size-dependent factors are responsible for the observation that species of larger
body sizes tend to produce lower frequencies[2],[3], yet some observations cannot be explained
by vocal fold size alone. First, the relation between fundamental frequency (fo) and body size
appears uncoupled within some species [4],[5],[6]. Considering that vocal fold size remains
closely linked to body size, other mechanisms must facilitate the fo variations. Second, vocal
fold morphology in the mammalian larynx [7],[8] and labial morphology in the avian syrinx
[9] vary greatly within and among species. Mechanical properties, a direct consequence of mor-
phological design, also show a large variation and contribute to vocal differences within and
between species [10],[11],[12],[8]. Third, the exceptionally large fo range that some species rely
on to generate large vocal versatility cannot be explained by size [11]. Here we present predic-
tions from vibrating string theory that offer an explanation for why a larger than expected
range of fo can be achievable in large and small species.
If all species had the same tissue construct and the same ability to strain the vocal folds, then
a vibrating string model would predict a larger fo range (in Hz) for smaller animals, as will be
shown. However, if the range is expressed in high/low ratios, or octaves, the range is normal-
ized across species. It will be shown that, additionally, there is a large variation in this high/low
ratio prediction because material properties are not the same and the ability to strain vocal fold
tissues is also not the same.
The mechanism for achievement of a large fo range in animals stands in stark contrast to the
design of man-made musical string instruments, which utilize multiple strings to cover a wide
pitch range. Violins have four strings, classical guitars have six, and pianos have eighty-eight,
which are either single, doubled, or tripled. With these multiple strings, violins and guitars can
produce on the order of 4–5 octaves of pitch range and a piano can produce a little over 7
octaves. Vocalizations in mammals [13],[14],[15],[16],[17],[18],[19] are generated by airflow-
induced vibrations of vocal folds or labia, respectively. Humans, other mammals, and birds can
produce 3 octaves, and in some cases 4–5 octaves, with a single pair of vocal folds in the larynx
or labia in the syrinx. Vocal folds are basically the equivalent of one double string. What are
the properties of these folds or labia that produce such versatile biological “strings”? We show
here that geometry plays a role, but the dominant factor is the molecular structure of laminated
tissue that can generate orders of magnitude variation in fiber tension.
The morphology of vibrating vocal fold tissue in the larynx is sufficiently complex that voice
scientists and clinicians have debated for decades whether “vocal fold” or “vocal cord” is the
best descriptor. Prior to Hirano’s [7] pioneering work, the term vocal cord was most prevalent,
but it was understood that only the vocal ligament, a portion of the entire tissue construct, was
cord-like. In human speech, the ligament is not under much tension, making the entire system

 fold-like in the sense that the superior portion folds over the inferior portion in vibration. Sim-
ple mechanical models have been of the mass-spring type to represent folding tissue,[20] but a
vibrating string model was also introduced [21], [22].
The conceptualization of a fiber-gel construct, not claimed here to be novel, embraces both
the fold and the string construct (Fig 1). The ground substance is a viscoelastic continuum in
the form of a homogenous, isotropic gel, similar to the vitreous humor in the eye. With the
inclusion of directional fibers in multiple layers (collagen and elastin in the lamina propria and
muscle fibers in the thyroarytenoid muscle), the construct develops into an adult human vocal
fold. The development is gradual, however, and is likely influenced by vocal demand. At birth,
the vocal fold consists of a single layer of ground substance (gel) with sparse fibers randomly
oriented [23]. Through childhood and puberty, the gel develops into multiple morphological
layers of tissue [26]. The superficial layer of the vocal fold lamina propria remains mostly
ground substance (gel-like), whereas the intermediate and deep layers develop into elastin and
collagen fibers aligned in a ventral-dorsal direction [24], [25], [26]. The fibers originate and
insert on cartilages in the larynx (not shown) that can be moved by laryngeal muscles. The
moving boundaries apply variable tension to the fibers.

 Methods
The main difference between multiple parallel strings on a violin and multiple “strings” embed-
ded in vocal fold ground substance is the amount of mechanical coupling between the strings.
The fibers cannot vibrate independently. There are cross-links in the form of an elastic matrix
and there are proteoglycans and glycoproteins that fill the spaces in the form of a viscous liq-
uid, leaving no air spaces between any of them. Such a viscoelastic medium, i.e., a laminated
fiber-gel system, is subject to the laws of continuum mechanics. However, when the fibers of
one layer are under considerable tension, the layer can be considered a “thick string vibrating
in a viscous soup.” The string modes of vibration then dominate over the gel modes of vibra-
tion [27]. Here we consider such a simplified string model to be appropriate because range of
fundamental frequency is largely determined by the fiber component. Small variations near the
lower bound of fo are determined by the combined viscoelastic properties of the gel and the
fibers, but these variations contribute to a small part of the total range of normal mode fre-
quencies [27].
How is vibration frequency controlled with tissue fibers?
In a string fixed at both ends and under tension, the fundamental frequency of the dominant
mode of vibration is

where L is the length of the string, μ0 is the combined shear and tensile stress for vibrational
displacement transverse to the string, and ρ is the tissue density. Density is a constant in soft
tissue (about 1.04 g/cm3), which leaves control of fo for any fibrous layer to L and μ0. In man-
made string instruments, length is either held constant (e.g., piano) or varied with finger posi-
tion (violin or guitar). In vocal folds, length can only be varied by moving boundary cartilages,
which means that individual layers cannot be lengthened or shortened independently. Thus,
with one common elongation, fiber stress μ0 becomes the critical variable for fo control between
layers.
Based on Eq (1), the total variation in fo can be written as

which after partial differentiation yields the expression

Here we see that an absolute frequency range Δfo (in Hz) varies directly with fo. If the terms
in brackets were equal across species, smaller species with higher mean fo would have larger
changes in fo. The above expression also shows that a positive change in fiber stress Δμ0/μ0 must
overcome the negative change in strain ΔL/L if a positive change Δ fo is to occur.
Non-muscular tissue layers, known as the lamina propria in the vocal folds, can experience
an increase in μ0 only with an increase in length. The length-tension curve must be highly non-
linear for a large fo range. The degree of nonlinearity is related directly to the desired fo range.
Stress-strain curves of the vocal ligament are typically exponential [28],[10],[12], of the form

Note that for B = 0 (constant fiber stress at all lengths), the fundamental frequency ratio is
inversely related to vocal fold length ratio. This is the general size principle. The larger the ani-
mal, the longer the vocal folds and the lower the frequency if stress is kept constant. The refer-
ence length Lo is generally taken as the in situ cadaveric length for measurement purposes.
From this reference length, the length for phonation can be increased and decreased on the
order of ± 50%, but typically more like ± 30%, as will be shown later. Fig 2 shows two contrast-
ing cases of how the same fo range can be produced. In Fig 2(A) the stress-strain curve is steep,
with a large B value, and the elongation is small. In Fig 2(B) the stress-strain curve is shallow,
with a small B value, but the elongation is large. Anatomically and physiologically, the trade-off
is between range of motion between cartilages versus fiber tension in the vocal folds.
Fig 3 shows a plot of Eq 5, with an assumption that L1 = 0.7Lo. The L2/L1 ratio is plotted on
the horizontal axis and the B value is the parameter. We will show that a value of 2 for L2/L1

 appears to be a typical limit in humans (a length change from L1 = 0.7Lo to L2 = 1.4Lo in the
phonation range). The value of B is determined by the density of collagen fibers that can be
packed into the ligament layer of tissue. According to Fig 3, a four octave range (fo2/fo1 = 16)
requires an exponent value of B = 10 if the L2/L1 ratio is 2, as the intersection of the middle ver-
tical dotted line and the upper red solid line shows in the diagram. If L2/L1 is restricted to 1.5,
only a 2 octave range is obtained with B = 10 (left-most dotted line). However, a 4 octave range
would be achievable with B = 7 (lower red line) if L2/L1 were 2.5 (right-most vertical dotted
line). Thus, frequency range hinges on two variables, ability to change vocal fold length and
nonlinearity of the dominant fiber stress-strain curve. Some data will now be given from vari-
ous species.
Measurements from human larynges
Vocal fold length change with fo has been quantified in several investigations. [29] used stereo
videoscopy to measure the membranous vocal fold length during phonation in 4 female and 3
male human subjects. For the males, L1 averaged 0.77 cm and L2 averaged 1.3 cm, such that L2/
L1 was 1.7. For the females, L1 averaged 0.71 cm and L2 averaged 1.1 cm, such that L2/L1 was
1.5. The fundamental frequency ranged on the order of 100–500 Hz for the males and 130–800
Hz for the females. Thus, a 2 ½ octave fo range was achieved with the L2/L1 ratios of 1.7 for
males and the L2/L1 ratio of 1.5 for females. Fig 1 would predict values of B in the 8–9 range if
the string model applies to the combination of fibrous tissue layers (ligament and muscle).
Later reports of measurements of B will confirm this range of values. In so-called “falsetto” reg-
ister, the vocal ligament (intermediate and deep layers of the lamina propria) dominates in fo
control [14]. In this falsetto region, Nishizawa et al. measured an approximate 1-octave fo
range with an L2/L1 ratio of no more than 1.2. According to Fig 3, this would require a value of
B of about 10–12. Min et al. [28] measured a value of 9.7 in human ligaments (8 specimens
from three males and two females, left and right averaged). Chan et al. [10] measured values of
9.4 for males and 7.6 for females.

 A more recent study by Cho et al. [30] on vocal fold length change in humans used an ultra-
sonic imaging technique to follow anterior and posterior landmarks on the vocal folds. Results
showed that L1 = 1.47 cm and L2 = 2.0 cm for males for low and high pitch, with L2/L1 = 1.4.
For females, L1 = 1.14 and L2 = 1.65 also yielded an L2/L1 ratio of 1.4. This is a little less than
the ratios of 1.7 for males and 1.5 for females reported by [29]. The small discrepancy is proba-
bly related to a smaller fo range in the Cho et al. study, but unfortunately the fo ranges were not
reported.
Measurements from non-human species
Measurements for length change versus fundamental frequency are also available from studies
using excised larynges [30], [31], [32]. For example, excised domestic dog (Canis familiaris)
larynges were vibrated on a laboratory bench with an artificial air supply [31]. Self-sustained
vocal fold oscillation was achievable from L1 = 0.5 cm to L2 = 1.2 cm, but these lengths were
produced mechanically rather than by muscle control. The corresponding fo range was 50 to
230 Hz, somewhat greater than 2 octaves. For this large L2/L1 ratio of 2.4, the value of B from
Fig 3 would be predicted to be about 6.0. Some dogs do not have a vocal ligament, but measure-
ments on canine mucosa produced a value of B = 4.4 and measurements on canine thyroaryte-
noid muscle fibers yielded a value of B = 6.5 [27]. Given that the thyroarytenoid muscle is the
fibrous layer in vibration, it would dominate the fo range. The predicted and measured value of
B are therefore in agreement.

[33–42]. In some cases, the frequency ranges are shown. Note that the rhesus monkey has an

 approximate four-octave range (100–1800 Hz). With values of B = 16.2 for males and 12.9 for
females, this range is achievable with a modest L2/L1 ratio of about 1.6 for males and 1.7 for
females according to Fig 3.
Fig 4(A) shows measurements of vocal fold cadaveric length Lo as a function of body mass
M for fourteen species in Table 1 (mouse to giraffe, in some cases both male and female). Note
the general increase in Lo with size, plotted logarithmically with the regression line
L0 ¼ 3:28 M0:4
r2 ¼ 0:96
p < 0:001
ð6Þ
The regression is a very tight fit over a length range of 1–40 mm and a body mass range of
.05–1000 kg, reinforcing the earlier claim that vocal fold length and body mass are tightly
related.
Fig 4(B) shows high and low values of fo as a function of body mass (size). There is a general
decrease of fo1 and fo2 with mass, expressed by the following regression lines

It is clear, however, that much greater variability is associated with these frequency trends,
suggesting that factors other than body mass play a role in fundamental frequency prediction.
Combining Fig 4(A) and 4(B) by eliminating the mass variable from the regression equations,
an inverse relation between fo1 and fo2 with cadaveric length Lo is obtained, as shown in Fig 4
(C). This inverse relation is in agreement with the B = 0 curve in Fig 3, showing only the length
dependence on fo. Note that the range of fo, if expressed logarithmically as a ratio fo2/fo1 rather

 than a difference fo2 –fo1, is essentially a constant. This is a strong validation of the simple
vibrating string model (Eq 5). Taking the ratio of Eq (7) to Eq (8) yields the number 12.0,
which constitutes about 3.5 octaves as an average across species.
Empirical data for exponent B versus Lo are shown in Fig 4(D). Omitting the one outlier
(the rhesus monkey), a mild trend is quantified by the relation
B ¼ 6:285 þ 0:0468 Lo
r2 ¼ 0:15
p < 0:3

ð9Þ
However, when the outlier is included, the trend disappears. Thus, with the sparsity of data
available across species, it is not possible to assert whether or not there is an increase in B with
longer vocal folds. What is important to note, however, is the large variation in B across species.
Since B is an exponent, a range of 3–15 leads to orders-of-magnitude variations in frequency
range.
With this empirical relation between B and Lo, a better fo range prediction can be made with
Eq 5. If we continue to assume that L1 = 0.7 Lo, as in humans, then Fig 5 shows a contour plot
of the fo2/fo1 range achievable in octaves. The two morphological variables are B on the vertical
axis and L2/L1 on the horizontal axis. The figure shows that a greater fo range is attainable with
either greater B or greater L2/L1. The empirical B values allow some species to be identified on
the figure. The greater the B value, the smaller L2/L1 needs to be to achieve a large fo range.
Conversely, the larger L2/L1 is, the smaller B needs to be to achieve a large fo range. For exam-
ple, the male rhesus monkey requires only an L2/L1 ratio of 1.6 for a 4-octave range. Humans,
lions, and tigers require an L2/L1 ratio of about 2.2 for a 4-octave range. For animals that
scream or roar, a larger B value may be a protective requirement for greater vibrational ampli-
tude and vocal fold collision.
Fig 5. Contour plot of predicted fundamental frequency range (high/low, fo2/fo1 ratio) for morphological variables B and
L2/L1. The range depends on two important factors: the rotational flexibility of the laryngeal framework, which facilitates L2/L1; and
the B value that quantifies the tissue stress response to elongation. For a given B value, a larger fundamental frequency range can
be achieved with greater rotational flexibility. For a given L2/L1 ratio, a larger frequency range can be achieved with a greater B
value. Note that the changes in the B value are not large to achieve a larger frequency range for a given a given L2/L1 ratio.

 Results and Discussion
A simple theory of the range of fundamental frequency fo achievable in various species has
been proposed. Laryngeal size, and specifically vocal fold length, is a good predictor of mean fo,
but a poor predictor of fo range. When vocal fold tissues become layered and tissue fibers
assume a ventral-dorsal direction, the layer with the densest and stiffest fiber composition pro-
duces string-like vibration and determines the fo range. This can be a vocal ligament or a layer
of muscle fibers. The stress-strain curve of the fibrous layer must be highly nonlinear to over-
come the natural tendency for fo to decrease with increased length. For an exponential stress
increase with a factor eBε, where ε is the strain (fractional length change) and B is a stiffness
constant, a range of values 5 < B < 15 can produce a 4–5 octave fo range with greater or lesser
length change. If the laryngeal framework mechanics allows a large length change, on the order
of ± 50% from the resting length, B values on the order of 5–10 can produce the 4–5 octave
range. If the larynx is restricted in its range of motion such that only a ± 20% length change is
possible, a value of B on the order of 10–15 is necessary to obtain a 4–5 octave range. A laryn-
geal adaptation for greater length change is greater rotation or gliding between cartilages that
anchor the ends of the vocal folds. Alternatively, a tissue layer that can bear a greater tension
(i.e., a ligament with high density collagen fibers) can also increase the fundamental frequency
range and thereby allow vocal versatility. As a consequence, fundamental frequency can
become uncoupled from size. Two large frequency ranges produced by two species can overlap
even if the two have dramatically different body sizes.
The proposed framework for fundamental frequency range regulation has three important
implications. First, voice production is an example of “many-to-one” mapping, which occurs
when the functional property of interest depends on more than one underlying morphologic
parameter [43]. In the cases of voice fundamental frequency, the parameters include laryngeal
framework mechanics and all variables affecting the B value, i.e. the number and depth of vocal
fold tissue layers, vocal fold boundary geometry, and tissue fiber stress. Consequently there are
surfaces in a morphospace that represent functionally neutral variations, which means that
morphological diversity between vocal folds of different species is not necessarily indicative of
functional diversity. The evolution of vibrating tissue design in laryngeal or syringeal sound
sources may lead to different morphologies that function similarly. For example, multilayered
characteristics have been described in vocal folds of different mammals[8],[12],[44] as well as
in alligators [45] and even within the oscillating tissue masses (“labia”) in the avian vocal
organ, the syrinx [9]. Laryngeal design across mammals is morphologically distinct in each spe-
cies but fundamental frequency remains overlapping. Findings in excised mammalian larynges
[32] or the excised avian syrinx [19] suggest that multiple activation patterns of intrinsic mus-
cles of the larynx and syrinx, respectively, produce a redundant output, i.e. they can facilitate
similar vocal frequencies. In a complex laryngeal or syringeal cartilaginous framework, differ-
ent muscle activations generate different tension settings of the oscillating tissue, yet in combi-
nation with the appropriate driving pressure, the soft tissue can vibrate at identical rates [46].
Our findings have a second, more practical implication as it pertains to the treatment of
human voice disorders. The observation that multiple vocal fold morphologies can serve the
same function, i.e. produce the same fundamental frequency, can be informative for surgical
treatment of impaired vocal folds. Surgery to remove vocal fold lesions often results in irrepara-
ble loss of normal vibratory mucosa [47]. Restoration of normal human vocal fold morphology
may not be feasible in many cases because the deficits are large. Our proposal that fundamental
frequency range can be regulated through two distinct mechanisms, and its broader implica-
tion that multiple vocal fold morphologies can achieve the same vocal output, suggest vocal
function may be restored with alternative strategies. Examples of alternative morphologies

 already exist in laryngeal surgery in which non-laryngeal tissue is used to restore voice produc-
tion [48],[49],[50]. However, the concept of alternative morphologies as viable solutions has
not been considered systematically in vocal fold repair and deserves further exploration. Com-
puter simulation of voice production can provide the means for intelligent exploration of the
vocal fold morphospace to search for viable alternatives. Simulations based on finite-element
and finite-difference approaches have been reported over the past two decades [51],[52],[53],
[54].
A single simulation produces one set of acoustic output variables given a defined input
vocal fold morphology at a fixed subglottal pressure. A meaningful comparison between two
different vocal fold morphologies should entail a range of possible acoustic outputs, given a
clinically relevant range of subglottal pressures as well as a range of physiologic variations in
the vocal fold morphologies. Such a comparison would entail thousands of simulation runs to
fully cover the range of inputs. One approach to reduce the computational cost and to increase
the efficiency of morphospace exploration is to combine a finite element model (FEM) voice
simulation with multiobjective optimization [55]. This approach has been applied to vocal fold
surgery simulation, in which the functional viabilities of two alternative vocal fold morpholo-
gies were demonstrated in silico [56].
Finally, the current findings relate well to vocal development and vocal training. If the den-
sity of collagen fibers in the vocal ligament is increased by exercise (frequent stretching), a
speaker or a singer can increase the fundamental frequency range even if the laryngeal frame-
work cannot be altered much due to tight spaces between cartilages. On the other hand, laryn-
geal massage and framework exercise could widen the spaces, allowing greater fo range with
existing molecular constructs. It appears that the development of a theory for fundamental fre-
quency range regulation based on comparative data across species in nature is paramount to
understanding possible intervention strategies for improving human communication.
