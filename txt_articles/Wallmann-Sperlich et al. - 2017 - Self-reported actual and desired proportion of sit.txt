Abstract 
Objective: Occupational sitting time in white‑collar workers represents a prominent contributor to overall daily 
sitting time, which is associated with various health risks. Workplace interventions intending to reduce sitting time 
during work typically focus on replacing sitting with standing. The aim was to investigate and compare actual and 
desired proportions of time spent sitting, standing, walking, and doing physically demanding tasks at work reported 
by desk‑based workers. Cross‑sectional data were collected from German desk‑based workers (n = 614; 53.3% men; 
40.9 ± 13.5 years). All were interviewed about their self‑reported actual and desired level of sitting, standing, walking 
and physically demanding tasks at work.
Results: Desk‑based workers reported to sit 73.0%, stand 10.2%, walk 12.9% and do physically demanding tasks 3.9% 
of their working hours. However, the individuals desire to sit, stand, walk and do physically demand tasks significantly 
different [53.8% sit, 15.8% stand, 22.8% walk, physically demanding tasks (7.7%), p < 0.001]. The present data revealed 
greatest mismatch between the desk‑based workers’ actual and desired time for sitting and walking. Health promo‑
tion programs should offer not only options for more standing but also opportunities for more walking within the 
workplace setting to better match workers’ desires.

Introduction
Research shows that high levels of sedentary behav-
iour are associated with negative health outcomes and 
all-cause mortality [1, 2]. Occupational sitting time is 
considered to be a prominent contributor to overall 
daily sitting time in white-collar workers [3–5] being 
particularly exposed to the health risks of prolonged 
sitting [6–8]. Consequently, reducing sitting time dur-
ing working hours has been highlighted in the past few 
years by health promotion efforts in the workplace set-
ting of office workers [9, 10]. Interventions that aim to 
reduce sitting time during work [11–13] often substi-
tute sitting with standing, i.e. through combined sit and 
stand desks [14–16]. However, these interventions were 
developed without taking the office workers preference 
into account. To the best of our knowledge, there is lit-
tle research about how long desk-based workers desire to 
sit, stand, walk or perform physical demanding tasks at 
their workplace. Knowledge about the workers’ desire in 
this regard could be helpful (i) to initiate countermeas-
ures against prolonged and uninterrupted sitting in the 
Open Access

workplace setting, and (ii) to stimulate greater compli-
ance among desk-based office workers to promote health.
Hence, the aim of this study was to examine and com-
pare self-reported actual and desired amount of work 
time spent sitting, standing, walking and doing physically 
demanding tasks in a desk-based workforce of German 
citizens. Data of this study were analysed previously to 
identify sociodemographic, health-related, and psycho-
social variables of workday sitting including having a 
height-adjustable desk [17].
Main text
Methods
Study design
In spring 2016 we conducted a nationwide cross-sec-
tional questionnaire-based telephone study on health 
behaviours including questions about self-reported sit-
ting time and physical activity (PA) in the workplace set-
ting in Germany. Survey methods have been described 
before [17]. Pre-tests were conducted in February 2016 
for face validity and participant comprehension of the 
questionnaire with n = 9 participants and the designated 
professional interviewers were trained in administering 
the computer-assisted standardised questionnaire. Pre-
tests revealed no changes necessary for the selected ques-
tions. All study procedures were approved by the Ethics 
Committee of the German Sport University in Cologne.
Sample
In total, 2830 representative residents (1386 men, 1444 
women) from all 16 German federal states who were 
over 18 years of age (mean 50.4 ± 18.3 years) were inter-
viewed. The sample was taken from the ADM Pool for 
Telephone Samples as described in more detail in [17]. 
The response rate for the study sample was 13.5%. In this 
study, we only included participants (i) who were work-
ing including participants in trainings and education, (ii) 
who specified that their work is a predominantly desk-
based job and (iii) who answered all questions regarding 
actual and desired proportion of sitting, standing, walk-
ing and doing physically demanding tasks. Because of 
these inclusion criteria and our data-cleaning process, we 
excluded data from respondents not working (n = 1202), 
not working predominantly desk-based jobs (n = 868) 
and because of missing values in one or all questions 
(n = 146). Ultimately, our sample consisted of 614 par-
ticipants (53.3% men; 40.9 ± 13.5 years).
Measures
Self‑reported actual sitting time and PA in the workplace 
setting The Occupational Sitting and Physical Activity 
Questionnaire (OSPAQ) was used to assess self-reported 
PA and sitting time in the office environment [18]. The 
OSPAQ is a validated instrument asking the participant to 
indicate the proportion of work time that she or he spends 
sitting, standing, walking, and doing physical demanding 
tasks on a typical workday in the last 7 days as well as the 
number of hours they had worked in the last 7 days (weekly 
working hours) and the number of days they were at work. 
To calculate the minutes per workday participants spent 
sitting, standing, walking, and doing physically demand-
ing tasks, self-reported percentage time spent in each 
activity was multiplied by the number of hours worked/
day at work. The OSPAQ shows excellent test–retest reli-
ability (ICC from 0.73 to 0.90) and moderate validity for 
estimating time spent sitting and standing at work com-
pared to accelerometers (r = 0.65 and r = 0.49) [18, 19].
Desired sitting time and PA in the workplace setting The 
desired sitting time and PA in the workplace setting was 
assessed similar to the proportion question of the OSPAQ 
with the following introduction phrase: “If you have the 
choice, what proportion of work time would you like to 
spend sitting, standing, walking, and doing physically 
demanding tasks on a typical workday?” To calculate the 
desired minutes per workday participants want to spend 
sitting, standing, walking, and doing physically demand-
ing tasks, self-reported desired percentage time spent 
in each activity was multiplied by the number of hours 
worked/day at work. These items were developed specifi-
cally for this study and pre-tested for face validity and par-
ticipant comprehension.
Socio‑demographic variables The demographic vari-
ables included self-reported age and gender. Additional 
socio-demographic variables comprised education and 
income levels. Education was categorised into the follow-
ing levels based on the German school system: ‘no school 
graduation’
, ‘10 years of education’
, ‘12 years of educa-
tion’
, ‘13 years of education’ and ‘first university degree or 
higher’
. Household net income per month was assessed in 
nine categories and summarised in three groups based on 
tertiles: ‘low income’ (< 1500€), ‘middle income’ (1500€–
2499€), and ‘high income’ (€ > 2500€).
Data analysis
We employed the data processing software PASW© 
(Version 23) for all statistical analyses. To calculate the 
difference between the actual proportions and min-
utes per working day of sitting, standing, walking and 
doing physically demanding tasks at work and the desired 
proportions and minutes per working day we applied 
the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the overall sample as 
well as for men and women separately. Multiple linear 
regression analyses investigated associations of socio-
demographic correlates and the dependent variables of 
 Page 3 of 6
Wallmann‑Sperlich et al. BMC Res Notes  (2017) 10:504 
“difference of actual-desired minutes of sitting”
, “differ-
ence of actual-desired minutes of standing”
, “difference 
of actual-desired minutes of walking” and “difference of 
actual-desired minutes of doing physically demanding 
tasks”
. We selected the forced entry method to explore 
the associations. Socio-demographic variables comprised 
age (continuous variable), education (five categories), 
income level (three categories) and working hours/work-
ing day (continuous variable). Statistical significance was 
set at a level of p < .05.
Results
Distribution of the proportion and minutes/working 
day of sitting, standing, walking and doing physically 
demanding tasks were not normally distributed. The par-
ticipants reported to sit 73.0 ± 21.7%, stand 10.2 ± 12.4%, 
walk 12.9 ± 10.9% and doing physically demanding tasks 
3.9 ± 8.2% of their working day. The participants desired 
to sit 53.8 ± 23.6% (< .001), stand 15.8 ± 13.7% (< .001), 
walk 22.8 ± 17.5% (< .001) and do physically demand-
ing tasks 7.7 ± 12.7% (< .001) of their working day (see 
Table 1).
Regression models explained 4% for the dependant 
variable “difference sitting” and “difference standing” 
and less than 1% for “difference walking” and “difference 
doing physically demanding tasks” (see Table 2). The first 
model revealed a positive association (β = .20) between 
the “hours/workday” and the dependant variable “differ-
ence sitting”
, meaning that the more hours/day the partic-
ipant spends working the greater the difference between 
“actual minus desired sitting time” is, which implicates 
that the longer the workdays the less the workers want to 
spend sitting. In the second model “hours per workday” 
were negatively associated (β = − .20) with the depend-
ant variable “difference standing”
, demonstrating that the 
longer the workday the smaller the difference is between 
“actual minus desired standing time”
, meaning the longer 
the wish is to stand during working hours.

Discussion
The novel finding of this study is that desk-based work-
ers desire to sit for approximately half (4.0 h) of their 
working day, which differs considerably from their self-
reported actual sitting proportion of over 70% (5.4 h). 
Interestingly the desired amount of standing and walking 
time (about 2.7 h) in our sample mirrors nicely a recently 
released expert statement. This report was conducted 
from a health perspective without looking at preferences 
and recommends desk-based workers to accumulate 
2 h of standing and light PA during working hours and 
progress to a total of 4 h/day (50% of an 8-h work day) 
[20]. Our results lend some support to the recommended 
reduction of sitting time to only 50% in the workplace 
setting which seems feasible in light of workers’ relatively 
congruent preferences for sitting, standing and walking. 
Alternatively, these results reflect respondents’ aware-
ness of recent guidance about occupational sitting time. 
The implementation of workers’ personal preferences for 
sitting and PA could make a substantial change and be 
important to reduce the risk for various negative health 
outcomes [6, 7]. However, it should be noted that inter-
vention studies have not been able to achieve this level 
of sitting reduction [21]. Regarding reducing occupa-
tional sitting time, positive attitude [22, 23], social norms, 
behavioural control and self-regulatory-skills can be 
important components in behaviour modification [23–
25]. Habit also explains sedentary behaviour in the occu-
pational setting [26]. Consequently, interventions need 
to pursue habit breaking attempts, e.g. through environ-
mental modifications [26–28], sit-stand desks [14–16], 
active design building [29], or behaviour change strate-
gies [23, 25, 28], as well as supportive workplace policies 
for more PA [9].
The second main finding of this study is that desk-
based workers expressed desire to walk significantly 
more during working hours than to stand and even 
desired more physically demanding tasks. The desired 
amount of walking is about 46 min/8 h-workday more 
than the self-reported amount, while the standing dif-
ference is only about 26 min/8 h-workday more. To date 
most of the health promotion activities in the desk-based 
working environment that are waged under the key mes-
sage “sit less, move more” [9, 30–32] achieves a reduc-
tion of sitting time through i.e. active workstations, but 
without increasing stepping [12, 15, 33] or vigorous PA. 
Our results suggest that future interventions in this area 
should focus more on increasing walking and PA dur-
ing working hours. This is also supported by the greater 
improvement of cardio-metabolic risk factors through 
walking or light, moderate and vigorous PA [34]. Options 
that increase walking and PA during working hours are 
warranted and should be included as part of a range of 
strategies in workplace programs that aim to reduce sit-
ting and increase PA.
Overall, the present data suggest a minor role of socio-
demographic factors such as gender, age, education or 
income on the dependent variables and recommend 
actions to reduce workplace sitting and increase PA for 
all workers, especially for workers with long working 
hours. However, we did not assess pre-existing health 
problems which could influence desired occupational sit-
ting and PA and should be considered in future studies.
Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that health promotion 
activities to reduce sitting time in the workplace set-
ting are supported by the desire of the desk-based work-
ers, which is a good foundation for workplace wellness 
actions. Our findings suggest health promotion programs 
should offer not only options for more standing but also 
opportunities for more walking within the workplace set-
ting to better match workers’ desires.
Limitations
The strength of the present study is the big nation-wide 
sample rather than the analysis of one specific company 
setting. From this point of view, the results provide a rep-
resentative insight of the desired sitting and PA of desk-
based workers in Germany. However, the low response 
rate is a limitation, which potentially may have been 
a result of the overall mean duration of this telephone-
based health survey (approx. 22.5 min). Comparing our 
study to other surveys [35], the present response rate 
seems acceptable. A further limitation is that this study 
obtained data based on self-reported sitting and PA in 
the workplace setting. Self-reporting of sitting is prone 
to potential bias via misclassifications or social desir-
ability and could have been controlled through objective 
measures [36], but this was logistically not feasible in this 
survey. Nevertheless, the specified 73.0% of sitting during 
working hours of the workers in the present study may be 
underestimated, but not differing much from the meas-
ured 78.8–82% of sitting during working hours in Aus-
tralia [3, 12].
