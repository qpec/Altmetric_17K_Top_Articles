Abstract
Precision and planning are key to reconstructive surgery. Augmented reality (AR) can bring the information within
preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) imaging to life, allowing the surgeon to ‘see through’ the
patient’s skin and appreciate the underlying anatomy without making a single incision. This work has demonstrated
that AR can assist the accurate identification, dissection and execution of vascular pedunculated flaps during
reconstructive surgery. Separate volumes of osseous, vascular, skin, soft tissue structures and relevant vascular
perforators were delineated from preoperative CTA scans to generate three-dimensional images using two
complementary segmentation software packages. These were converted to polygonal models and rendered by
means of a custom application within the HoloLens™ stereo head-mounted display. Intraoperatively, the models
were registered manually to their respective subjects by the operating surgeon using a combination of tracked
hand gestures and voice commands; AR was used to aid navigation and accurate dissection. Identification of the
subsurface location of vascular perforators through AR overlay was compared to the positions obtained by audible
Doppler ultrasound. Through a preliminary HoloLens-assisted case series, the operating surgeon was able to
demonstrate precise and efficient localisation of perforating vessels.

Background
This work presents a series of pioneering attempts to util-
ise augmented reality (AR) technology in reconstructive
surgery with the HoloLens™, an AR device developed and
marketed by the Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, WA,
USA). It aims to test the ability of this wearable system to
aid the identification of surgical landmarks when perform-
ing vascular pedunculated flaps of the lower extremities.
Three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality has already been
shown to be useful in the identification of suitable perfora-
tors in deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flaps and
improves perioperative outcomes [1, 2]. The intraopera-
tive application of AR offers exciting possibilities, such as
the simplification and accurate performance of procedures
that could result in the reduction of anaesthetic time and
occurrence of adverse outcomes. Furthermore, it can
facilitate preoperative planning and surgical training, as
well as provide 3D telemedicine support.

 One of the key advantages of wearable systems such as
the HoloLens is that it can be used without compromising
environment sterility. It is operated with hand gestures and
voice commands instead of touch. As a self-contained
computer, a very broad range of information can be
accessed in real time while remaining sterile in the operat-
ing theatre. Novel techniques projecting reconstructed
computed tomography (CT) data have shown benefit in
the localisation of lymph nodes and planning of flaps [3, 4].
What is more, it is believed that reconstructive surgery
provides an excellent opportunity for AR in the visualisa-
tion of tissue following injury, when anatomical landmarks
might have been distorted. In addition, accurate detection
of complex vasculature is of paramount importance in the
performance of vascular flaps and AR can enable detailed
yet unambiguous visualisation to help avoid potential er-
rors. Furthermore, the lower extremities permit the use of
relatively rigid geometrical structures, such as bony promi-
nences and the skin silhouette, which help to overcome
the main registration limitation of tissue deformation.
The HoloLens was chosen as it is currently considered
to be one of the most suitable AR devices for surgical
practice [5, 6]. CT angiography (CTA) has been shown
to reduce operative time by allowing visualisation of po-
tential flap perforators and for comparison to be made
between perforators in terms of their suitability [7, 8].
CTA may also reduce the incidence of partial and
complete flap loss [9] and its superiority over Doppler
ultrasound is well established [10]. Furthermore, CTA is
a useful technique to examine the donor vascular anat-
omy or the vascular supply to an injured extremity [11].
Some of the drawbacks of using CTA stem from trans-
ferring the elaborate imaging information into a clinically
useable form and thence the availability of this informa-
tion during an operation. Often this requires the surgeon
to pre-examine the scans in detail using measurements of
a perforator’s location from several anatomical landmarks
[12]. The surgeon must then triangulate the position of
that perforator on the patient at the outset of the
procedure, without any depth analysis. This is not only
time-consuming and complex, especially when dealing
with multiple perforators, but also error-prone. Other
techniques such as stereotactic image-guided navigation
[13] and combining CT, Doppler ultrasound and radio-
opaque markers have been described [14].
AR offers a novel solution to the problem of accurate
and rapid perforator localisation by allowing image over-
lay on the patient during the operation. In a patient-
specific manner, relevant information can be built into
the rendered ‘hologram’ with varying degrees of com-
plexity. Thus, multiple perforators, their source, course
and relation to the underlying skeleton and nearby
wounds can be immediately identified. This enables the
surgeon to tailor their approach according to the specific
anatomical variations of the patient. With that goal in
mind, the following sections outline use of the HoloLens
system during the development of perforating blood
vessel maps in plastic surgery.
Methods
The overall workflow is summarised in Fig. 1. Written
informed consent was taken from patients recruited to
this ethically approved preliminary study. The HoloLens
software was used only within the institution where it
was developed. Preoperative contrast-enhanced CTA
scans were performed using a 256-slice Philips Brilliance
CT scanner (Koninklijke Philips N.V., Amsterdam, The
Netherlands). The scans were undertaken with patients
in the prone position to limit tissue deformation of the
soft tissues of the calf and to reduce compression of the
perforating veins. In certain cases, this was not possible
due to other injuries limiting prone positioning of the
patients. As an alternative, the respective legs were
elevated to prevent compression of the calf skin and
muscle. This was done to mitigate the effect of anatom-
ical deformation between acquisition time and interven-
tion and thereby minimise registration error. In order to
distend the lower leg perforators, a tourniquet was applied

 above the knee level. To obtain both arterial and venous
phases within a single contrast scan, a phased administra-
tion of contrast agent was performed. Specifically, a split
bolus comprising two 70-mL volumes of Omnipaque
(General Electric Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) was ad-
ministered intravenously, followed by a saline bolus chaser.
Typically, the images were acquired with an axial in-plane
resolution of 0.7 mm and slice thickness of 0.9 mm.
The CTA volumes were segmented using the Vitrea
6.7.4 software (Vital Images, Inc., Minnetonka, MN,
USA) into skin, bone, muscle, and vascular models by
the consultant radiologist. The vascular models were
produced with segmentations of both venous and arter-
ial vessels of the lower leg. Where appropriate, the
trunks of the medial sural artery perforators (MSAPs)
were segmented together with the associated site of per-
foration through the muscle fascia. The lengths of the
trunk and its branches were calculated using the Vitrea
built-in vascular tools and the approximate site of each
perforator was measured relative to the medial femoral
epicondyle. Skin segmentations were performed using
the Vitrea autoskin function, whereby a combination of
voxel thresholding and morphological operations rapidly
identifies the outer tissue layer. This facilitates accurate
hands-free registration of models to their respective pa-
tients. In addition, the bone segmentations allowed for
accurate correlation with anatomical landmarks such as
the tibial tuberosity. Before surgery, each case was dis-
cussed with the surgical team to explain the models and
anatomy and to confirm the choice of perforator. It was
not uncommon to mark a selection of perforators so
that a decision could be made at the time of surgery.
The segmented volumes were then loaded as Digital
Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
files into ITK-SNAP 3.6.0 [15], where minor refinements
were made through meticulous use of its region growing
and manual painting functionality, and where mesh repre-
sentations were generated by the marching cubes algo-
rithm [16]. These were further manipulated with MeshLab
1.3.3 [17] for smoothing and mesh complexity. Respect-
ively, the manipulations performed were Humphrey’s
Classes Laplacian smoothing [18], followed by edge col-
lapse decimation using a quadric error metric [19]. These
resulted
in
optimised
anatomical
representations,
increasing the performance of the HoloLens application
while minimising loss of model precision. Tests were per-
formed to check whether the loss of precision was within
the clinically acceptable range (5 mm) for this specific ap-
plication. For example, the axial length of the skin model
for Case #1 was reduced by 0.92 mm over a total of
591.6 mm, equal to a change of 0.16%.
Written within the Unity framework, version 2017.1
(Unity Technologies, San Francisco, CA, USA), a custom-
developed HoloLens C# Universal Windows Platform ap-
plication was utilised at the time of patient marking. Once
launched, the application generated ‘holographic’ overlays,
correctly rendered for both left and right eyes, at a default
distance and rotation with respect to the wearer’s coordin-
ate frame. Subsequently, using a combination of spatial
translation and rotation hand gestures, the operating
surgeon manipulated the virtual anatomy from a static
posture until a satisfactory degree of anatomical landmark
and skin outline alignment against the anaesthetised pa-
tient were achieved.
Through either voice commands or a toolbar but-
ton, the user interface permits switching between
translation and rotation modes. In both cases the
HoloLens ‘air-tap and hold’ gesture was used as a
source of 3D motion input. Having been employed
successfully in other image guidance applications [20],
the ‘rolling ball’ control mechanism [21] was adopted
as it provides a very intuitive way of manipulating
orientation that is independent of observer viewpoint.
The spatial scale information embedded in each CTA
scan was retained throughout the segmentation and
object building process, so that no scale adjustments
were required following HoloLens model import. The
required procedural changes were minimal. Having
annotated the skin with a sterile marker pen under
HoloLens guidance, the target positions were com-
pared to the sites of the perforator vessels as subse-
quently identified by audible Doppler ultrasound and
surgical appearances.

 2), at the time of operation, the defect was covered with a
split skin graft only. An example of the original CTA im-
aging, segmentation, and corresponding polygonal models
is shown in Fig. 2. Captured from a HoloLens position re-
mote from the patient, examples of AR overlay are shown
in Fig. 3, adjacent to an image illustrating confirmation of
target position with audible Doppler ultrasound. Figure 4
shows both the manner in which target positions within
AR overlays are transferred to the skin permanently with a
marker pen and the subsequent raising of the pedunculated
flap. The approximate times taken to perform the steps
comprising the workflow are summarised as follows: pa-
tient scan (5 min); segmentation (10–20 min); model prep-
aration (20–30 min); HoloLens upload and configuration
(<1 min); and intraoperative manual registration (1–2 min).
Case 1
This 53-year-old man sustained an open subtalar joint dis-
location, with loss of soft tissue over the lateral aspect of the
foot and ankle. The MSAP flap was chosen due to the thin
pliable tissue being a good match with the native tissue and
its lack of bulk. Intraoperatively, a 20 × 15 cm flap was raised
based on a perforator at 13 cm from the joint line. The pos-
ition of the MSAP was identified using the HoloLens overlay
and traditional Doppler technique. The surgical position of
the MSAP was visually indistinguishable from that identified
by the HoloLens. Subsequently, the distal 2 cm of the ped-
icle was raised with a narrow cuff of muscle.
Case 3
This 57-year-old man sustained an open fracture of the
medial malleolus of his right ankle following a road traf-
fic accident. He was worked up for a free tissue transfer
to cover this as there were no obviously good local tissue
options. A very large perforator was noted coming off
the posterior tibial artery proximal to the defect. The de-
cision was made therefore to proceed with a propeller
flap. The perforator was completely dissected out down
to the deep fascia and the position of the perforator cor-
responded to the position identified by the HoloLens
with no visible discrepancy. The deep fascia and the
proximal tissue were then rotated 180° into the soft
tissue defect.
Case 4
Following a previously treated open tibial fracture one
year before the current presentation, this patient suf-
fered a minor cut which later developed into infection,
requiring formal soft tissue reconstruction. The patient
was worked up for a MSAP flap from the contralateral
side as, due to the extensive previous trauma, it was felt
that a traditional distally based local flap was not pos-
sible. However, CTA revealed two good-sized ipsilateral
tibialis posterior perforators entering the soft tissue
proximal to the defect. On this occasion, there was
interval removal of external fixation that resulted in soft
tissue deformation and a < 1-cm discrepancy in the op-
erative AR position of the perforator and the surgical

 findings. A fasciocutaneous flap was then fashioned that
was transposed distally over the defect to gain good soft
tissue cover.
Case 5
This 41-year-old man was involved in a road traffic acci-
dent and sustained a multiplanar degloving to the lateral
aspect of his right foot and ankle, with an exposed open
displaced dislocation of the talus. There was a defect in
the soft tissue underlying the bone which had been
stripped of much of its periosteum and therefore it was
concluded that he would require flap coverage. In ac-
cordance with the CTA findings and HoloLens overlay, a
MSAP was raised from the ipsilateral calf, 8 × 16 cm in
size. The flap was anastomosed to the anterior tibial ar-
tery with an end-to-side join. A 2-mm coupler was used
to join a vena comitans to the anterior tibial vein in an
end-to-end fashion. The short saphenous vein that was
harvested within the flap was anastomosed to a superfi-
cial vein within the foot.
Case 6
An 85-year-old woman sustained an open medial malle-
olus fracture with an associated closed fibular fracture.
Following an initial debridement procedure, the patient
returned to theatre where a lateral plate was used to fix
her fibula. The medial wound was too large to close
directly and thus a fasciocutaneous flap was raised from
her medial lower leg adjacent to the defect. While three
posterior tibial perforators were seen on the CT angio-
gram and visualised with the HoloLens, the flap was estab-
lished to include the two most inferior vessels. Doppler
ultrasound confirmed accurate localisation with no visible
discrepancy. While optimising blood supply, the two-
vessel solution did slightly restrict movement, although
sufficient transposition of tissue was ultimately possible.
Discussion
It was possible to construct valuable AR models from
CTA scans of the lower leg perforators and to use these
models in a series of reconstructive surgeries over six
cases. The HoloLens proved to be a powerful tool that
has the potential to reduce anaesthetic time and morbid-
ity associated with surgery as well as to improve training
and provide remote support for the operating surgeon.
Detailed feedback from the surgical team verified that
this new approach is more reliable and therefore consid-
erably less time-consuming than audible Doppler ultra-
sound, the prevailing standard method of navigation.
The specific challenges addressed in this preliminary re-
port include the provision of a practical user interface
for spatial model manipulation, streamlining of the data
preparation pipeline for high-resolution volumes and the
export of reference coordinates for arrow localisation.
One limitation is that presently a technical assistant is
required initially to help with preoperative data prepar-
ation and later in the operating theatre to assist with
application launch and approximate spatial model posi-
tioning before involvement of the operating surgeon.
Further work is certainly warranted to realise auto-
matic segmentation, volumetric rendering and instantan-
eous model alignment, to correct for tissue deformation,
to measure the impact on operative time and surgical
outcomes, and to quantify further the targeting accuracy
with respect to traditional methods. The experience
gained hitherto suggests that the techniques developed
through this work are appropriate for reconstructive sur-
gery applied to other areas of the body.
