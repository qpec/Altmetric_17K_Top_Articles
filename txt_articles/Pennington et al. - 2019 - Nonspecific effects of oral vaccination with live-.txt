Epidemiological and immunological evidence suggests that some vaccines can reduce all-cause mortality through 
nonspecific changes made to innate immune cells. Here, we present the first data to describe the nonspecific 
immunological impact of oral vaccination with live-attenuated Salmonella Typhi strain Ty21a. We vaccinated 
healthy adults with Ty21a and assessed aspects of innate and adaptive immunity over the course of 6 months. 
Changes to monocyte phenotype/function were observed for at least 3 months. Changes to innate and adaptive 
immune cell cytokine production in response to stimulation with vaccine and unrelated nonvaccine antigens 
were observed over the 6-month study period. The changes that we have observed could influence susceptibility 
to infection through altered immune responses mounted to subsequently encountered pathogens. These changes 
could influence all-cause mortality.
INTRODUCTION
Epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that live-attenuated 
vaccines can reduce all-cause mortality (1, 2). The strongest evidence 
has been collected in resource-poor settings after vaccination with 
oral polio vaccine (OPV), Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and 
measles-containing vaccines (3–7). Recently, the World Health 
Organization Special Advisory Group of Experts has recommended 
that further research should be undertaken to better understand the 
nonspecific impact of vaccination on all-cause mortality (8, 9).
Nonspecific beneficial effects of vaccination are believed to be the 
result of the generation of innate immune memory through epigenetic 
modification (10–12). These changes may manifest themselves in the 
form of phenotypic variation among circulating innate cell popula-
tions, as well as altered cytokine production in response to in vitro 
cell stimulation (13).
Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR-5) engagement at the mucosal surface 
of the gastrointestinal tract is known to enhance immune responses 
to influenza vaccination (14). It has been demonstrated that the 
live-attenuated oral Salmonella vaccine, Ty21a, has the capacity to 
aid in the regression of bladder cancer, which is believed to be the 
result of TLR engagement (15). We have also observed enhanced 
cellular responses to influenza virus at the duodenal mucosa 18 days 
after vaccination with Ty21a (16). We therefore hypothesized that 
oral vaccination with Ty21a may have the capacity to generate 
innate immune memory and alter immune responses to unrelated 
pathogens.
A number of Salmonella-based vectors are in development (17, 18) 
and an increased understanding of the off-target impacts of live- 
attenuated strains of Salmonella could further inform their develop-
ment. The identification of bacteria that generate innate immune 
memory may lead to the development of therapeutics, vectors, 
and adjuvants capable of reducing all-cause mortality and/or en-
hancing the efficacy of vaccines targeting a wide array of unrelated 
pathogens.
We have previously shown that vaccination with Ty21a generates 
long-lived vaccine-specific peripheral immune responses (19). Here, 
we have assessed the wider, off-target impact of vaccination with 
Ty21a on human immunity at 14 days, 3 months, and 6 months after 
vaccination. We assessed innate immune cell surface marker expres-
sion as well as interferon- (IFN-) [T helper 1 (TH1)], interleukin-4 
(IL-4) (TH2), IL-17A (TH17), transforming growth factor– (TGF-) 
(regulatory), and tumor necrosis factor– (TNF-) (TH1) production 
among B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, mucosal- 
associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and  T cells after in vitro 
stimulation with a range of antigens.
RESULTS
Volunteer recruitment
Volunteers aged between 18 and 60 years were invited to participate 
in this study. Volunteers were excluded from participation if they 
had previously been immunized with Ty21a or if they had previously 
visited a typhoid-endemic region (Asia or sub-Saharan Africa). 
Volunteers were also excluded if they were pregnant, if they were 
taking any immunosuppressive medications, or if they had a chronic 
illness. There were no substantial differences between the groups 
with regard to age or gender; however, it should be noted that con-
siderably more females than males were recruited to both the vacci-
nated group and the control group (Table 1).
Monocyte phenotype
We measured the relative expression intensity of CD11b (integrin M), 
CD11c (integrin X), CD14, CD16 (FcRIII), CD18 (integrin 2), CD64 
(FcRI), CD123 (IL-3RA), CD206 (mannose receptor), CD303 
(BDCA-2), HLA-DR (human leukocyte antigen - DR isotype), TLR-4, 
and TLR-5 on the surface of nonstimulated CD14+ monocytes from 
vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers by flow cytometry. A se-
quential gating strategy was used to identify populations of interest 
(Fig. 1). We compared the phenotypic properties of cells isolated

from vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers at day 0 with those 
isolated at 14 days, 3 months, and 6 months.
We observed increased expression of CD11b, CD11c, CD16, 
CD64, CD303, TLR-4, and TLR-5 among vaccinated volunteers at 
14 days (P = 0.006, P = 0.027, P = 0.048, P = 0.013, P = 0.001, 
P = 0.003, and P = 0.0002, respectively; Fig. 2). Increased expression 
of CD11b, CD16, CD303, TLR-4, and TLR-5 was observed at 
3 months (P = 0.002, P = 0.041, P = 0.043, P = 0.041, and P = 0.026, 
respectively; Fig. 2). Expression of all receptors among vaccinated 
volunteers was comparable with baseline at 6 months. No change in 
the expression intensity of CD14, CD18, CD123, CD206, and 
HLA-DR was observed among the vaccinated group at any time 
point. Among control group volunteers, increased expression of 
CD11b was observed at 14 days (P = 0.009; Fig. 2). No change in the 
expression intensity of any other receptor at any time point was 
observed among the control group (Fig. 2).
Among vaccinated volunteers, where increased expression was 
observed at 14 days, men were fairly evenly distributed throughout 
the population; however, at 3 months, even where increased expres-
sion persisted, men tended to be clustered below the mean line 
(Fig. 2).
Cytokine production
Cells were stimulated in vitro with a range of bacterial, fungal, or 
viral antigens: heat-killed live-attenuated S. Typhi strain Ty21a, heat- 
killed Candida albicans, split-viron influenza virus, purified protein 
derivative (PPD) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or tetanus tox-
oid. We then assessed the production of IFN-, IL-4, IL- 
17A, TGF-, 
and TNF- among B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, monocytes, 
MAIT cells, and  T cells by flow cytometry. A sequential gating 
strategy was used to identify populations of interest (Fig. 3). The 
change in integrated mean fluorescence intensity (iMFI) at 14 days, 
3 months, and 6 months was calculated relative to day 0. Heat maps 
showing change in iMFI were used to summarize data from vacci-
nated and unvaccinated volunteers (Fig. 4).
To compare the iMFI profiles of vaccinated and unvaccinated 
volunteers, we performed multivariate linear discriminant analysis 
of principal components (DAPC) to determine whether vaccination 
had influenced heterologous in vitro cytokine production. DAPC is 
particularly useful since it reduces the impact of variation within 
the groups.
We first created a DAPC model that included all data collected 
for each stimulus, cell type, and cytokine and used it to predict vol-
unteer vaccination status. This model, which comprised 24 principal 
components, was able to reclassify all volunteers with an accuracy 
of 92.4% (Fig. 5A). Loading plots (Fig. 5A), which detail the vari-
ables that contributed most toward the accuracy of DAPC, were 
combined with summary evidence from heat maps to identify 
changes in output that were most marked between vaccinated and 
unvaccinated volunteers (Fig. 4). These data revealed that the largest 
contributing variable was the monocyte IFN- responses to heat-killed 
C. albicans (increased output in the vaccinated group) and that the 
second largest contributing variable was the B cell IL-4 responses to 
heat-killed C. albicans (increased output in the vaccinated group).
When we created a second DAPC model, which excluded Ty21a 
stimulus data, the accuracy of the model, which also comprised 24 
principal components, was unchanged and was able to reclassify all 
volunteers with an accuracy of 92.4% (Fig. 5B). Loading plots (Fig. 5B), 
combined with summary evidence from heat maps (Fig. 4), revealed 
that, once more, the largest contributing variable was the monocyte 
IFN- responses to heat-killed C. albicans (increased output in the 
vaccinated) and that the second largest contributing variable was the 
B cell TNF- responses to PPD from M. tuberculosis (increased output 
in the control group and decreased output in the vaccinated group).
Visual inspection of heat maps also revealed a tendency toward 
increased IFN- among all cell types in response to heat-killed 
C. albicans in the vaccinated group. These data suggest that vacci-
nation with Ty21a does influence responses to an array of unrelated 
pathogens and that vaccinated volunteers may be identified on the 
basis of these altered cytokine expression profiles.
DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated that oral vaccination with S. Typhi strain 
Ty21a can induce up-regulation of CD11b, CD11c, CD16, CD64, 
CD303, TLR-4, and TLR-5 among CD14+ monocytes for as long as 
3 months. We have further demonstrated that vaccination with 
Ty21a alters cytokine production among various cell populations in 
response to stimulation with nonrelated pathogens.
In studies assessing the nonspecific beneficial effects of vaccina-
tion, TLR-4, as well as CD14, CD11b, and CD206, has been shown 
to be up-regulated among monocytes for at least 1 year following 
vaccination with BCG (13). Challenge with wild-type S. Typhi has 
been shown to induce activation of circulating monocytes and den-
dritic cells (DCs) for up to 96 hours following onset of disease (20). 
Here, we have observed the increased expression of TLR-4 and 
TLR-5 on monocytes for at least 3 months following vaccination 
with Ty21a—this is likely to be a response to the engagement of 
these TLRs by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagella, respectively. In 
addition to changes among TLRs, which are semipathogen specific, 
we also observed increased expression of CD11b, CD11c, CD16, 
CD64, and CD303; the up-regulation of these molecules is associated 
with enhanced phagocytic function and antigen presentation as well 
as enhanced chemotaxic potential (21–23). Consistent with pub-
lished observations that demonstrate that nonspecific effects of 
vaccination are most marked in females (9, 24–26), changes to 
monocyte phenotype among our study cohort appeared to be most 
long-lived among female volunteers. Unfortunately, since this was

not an a priori hypothesis, and considerably more females were re-
cruited to this study than males, we were unable to perform robust 
statistical analysis concerning the impact of gender, and further 
study would be required to confirm this important observation.
In murine models, live-attenuated influenza vaccine has been 
shown to confer immediate protection against respiratory syncytial 
virus (27). We have previously reported the early generation of 
cellular responses to influenza virus at the human duodenal mucosa 
18 days following vaccination with Ty21a (16). These earlier non-
specific effects of vaccination, possibly a result of short-lived, local-
ized, and self-limiting inflammation and/or up-regulation of cellular 
homing markers, may reduce susceptibility to infection in the days/
weeks following vaccination, through heightened localized mucosal 
immune defense. It is significant, however, that here we have ob-
served the increased expression of CD11b, CD16, CD303, TLR-4, and 
TLR-5 among monocytes for at least 3 months. Since monocytes 
typically only persist in circulation for a single day (28), we believe 
that the changes we have observed here are the result of epigenetic

as cells that expressed either CD4 or CD8 that had not already been identified as  T cells or MAIT cells. (B) Dead cells were removed by staining for viability (LIVE/DEAD) and

modifications occurring at the progenitor level. Consistent with 
this, treatment with LPS has been shown to phosphorylate the 
stress-response transcription factor ATF7, leading to reduced re-
pressing histone methylation (H3K9me2) and increased activating 
histone methylation (H3K4me3), resulting in increased ATF7 
target gene expression and enhanced pathogen resistance (29, 30). 
Since no differences were observed here at 6 months, it is likely that 
monocytes do eventually return to a phenotype more in line with the 
individuals’ natural state. Nevertheless, in the 3 months following 
vaccination, these changes are likely to have a significant impact on the 
capture and presentation of antigen by differentiated monocytes—
DCs and macrophages—and the adaptive immune responses that 
are subsequently generated.
Many factors influence human cytokine production; variation 
has been reported over a period as short as 24 hours (31). We 
observed temporal variation in cytokine production in the unvacci-
nated control group over a 6-month period. It is possible that 
changes in the control group may be the result of seasonal variation 
in the relative frequency with which different pathogens are en-
countered. With regard to our study cohort, the first sample from 
the first volunteer was acquired in May and the last sample from the 
last volunteer was acquired in December. To ensure that effects, 
particularly those surrounding heterologous responses, are not 
wrongly attributed to vaccination or clinical intervention, tempo-
rally matched controls such as those used here are essential. This 
is important since temporal variation may, at least in part, con-
tribute toward altered cytokine production that has been observed 
elsewhere (13).
OPV, BCG, and measles containing vaccines appear to be asso-
ciated with reductions in all-cause mortality (3–7). It has previously 
been demonstrated that cytokine production in response to in vitro 
stimulation with heterologous antigens is altered following vaccina-
tion with BCG (13). It is unclear whether changes in cytokine pro-
duction are the result of altered antigen presentation occurring in 
vitro or whether these changes reflect modifications to immune cell 
population composition in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first 
instance where the simultaneous assessment of cytokine production 
by multiple cell types has been attempted in the context of trained 
immunity, with previous studies having relied on the assessment of 
supernatants collected following in vitro stimulation (13).
Our use of DAPC has allowed us to make the general conclusion 
that vaccination with Ty21a does alter cytokine production to non-
related pathogens. Since DAPC modeling revealed a similar capac-
ity to reassign volunteers, even when Ty21a data were excluded, we

can assume that the specific responses generated to the vaccine were 
not the only responses that enabled discrimination of the two 
groups. This suggests that vaccination with Ty21a did alter cytokine 
responses to heterologous antigens. Variation within the human 
population may mean that we are underpowered to observe some 
other important biological effects.
It is notable that responses to heat-killed Ty21a were not the 
largest contributors to DAPC. Rather, we observed that monocyte 
IFN- responses to heat-killed C. albicans and B cell IL-4 responses 
to heat-killed C. albicans contributed most significantly to DAPC. 
These responses were increased in the vaccinated group, and since 
IL-4 is essential for the development of protective TH1 (IFN-) re-
sponses to C. albicans (32), the data we have presented would sug-
gest that volunteers vaccinated with Ty21a may be less susceptible 
to infection by C. albicans. Monocyte and B cell responses to a range 
of other antigens, including those derived from M. tuberculosis and 
influenza, consistently featured among the largest contributors to 
DAPC. Differentiated monocytes—DCs and macrophages—play a 
prominent role in innate immune defense and in antigen presenta-
tion. B cells, in addition to their role in immunoglobulin produc-
tion, also play a role in antigen presentation and in the generation 
of T cell responses (33, 34). Data presented here would suggest that 
modified cytokine output by monocytes and B cells, cells that also 
play a role in antigen presentation, may be particularly important 
with regard to the generation of the nonspecific beneficial effects 
that have been observed elsewhere (3–7). It should be noted that, to 
date, no data have been presented that demonstrate that these kinds 
of immunological observations are responsible for observed re-
ductions in all-cause mortality in humans (35). Further study is 
warranted to more fully characterize the contribution of innate, 
proinflammatory, and regulatory cell types and effector molecules 
in conferring these nonspecific beneficial effects.
The burden of typhoidal disease is highest in children under 
5 years (36). Although Ty21a, in its currently licensed capsule for-
mulation, is not approved for use in children, it has previously been 
demonstrated that, when administered in liquid suspension, Ty21a 
is fully immunogenic in children aged between 2 and 6 years 
(37, 38). The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant S. Typhi 
(39) and the more recent emergence of extensively drug- 
resistant 
S. Typhi (40) have placed increased importance on the develop-
ment of more effective vaccines targeting S. Typhi, which may be 
easily administered in regions of endemic disease. In addition to their 
direct impact on typhoid, it is possible that next-generation orally 
administered live-attenuated Salmonella vaccines, which are at 
various stages of development (41), may also have indirect benefi-
cial effects.
Data presented here support the development of orally adminis-
tered live-attenuated Salmonella-based adjuvant/vector platforms 
that may confer nonspecific beneficial effects. Ty21a, or other 
live-attenuated Salmonella vaccines, may also have direct applica-
tions in their own right as interventions capable of reducing all-
cause mortality. OPV—a vaccine that has been shown to reduce 
all-cause mortality by as much as 17% (7)—will soon be replaced by 
inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). While IPV does not carry the same 
risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, the replacement 
of OPV with IPV may actually have a detrimental impact on all-
cause mortality owing to the inability of IPV to confer the non-
specific beneficial effects that have previously been associated with 
OPV (42, 43). It is possible that vaccines such as Ty21a, which are 
low cost, extremely well tolerated, and easily administered, could be 
included in wider vaccination programs, even in non–typhoid- 
endemic regions, solely for their off-target, nonspecific beneficial 
effects. Since it has been demonstrated that a liquid formulation 
of Ty21a is immunogenic in children (37, 38), this strategy could 
potentially be tested for relevance in the field in young age groups, 
where its impact would likely be greatest. If this strategy were to 
be pursued, it would represent a step change in global vaccination 
policy and could have a profoundly positive impact on populations 
in low-income settings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical approval, recruitment, and study protocol
All volunteers provided written informed consent. This study was 
approved by the United Kingdom National Research Ethics Service 
(14/NW/1455). Thirty healthy adult volunteers were enrolled into 
the study. Sixteen volunteers (4 males and 12 females) were randomly 
selected for oral vaccination with live-attenuated S. Typhi (Ty21a; 
Vivotif). Three doses of a single oral capsule were taken on days 0, 
2, and 4, approximately 1 hour before a meal, with a cold or luke-
warm drink. Fourteen volunteers (2 males and 12 females) were 
randomly assigned to an unvaccinated control group.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation
Peripheral blood samples were collected in lithium heparin 
Vacutainers at day 0, 14 days, 3 months, and 6 months. Peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated via Ficoll-Paque 
PLUS (GE Healthcare) using LeucoSep Centrifuge Tubes (Greiner), 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Full details are pre-
sented in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Antigenic stimulation and incubation
PBMCs (1 × 106 cells per well) were seeded in complete medium in 
96-well V-bottom plates. Cells in each well were stimulated with 
either 2 × 106 colony-forming units (CFU) of heat-killed S. Typhi 
Ty21a (Vivotif; suspended in Dulbecco’s PBS, quantified, and then 
killed by incubation at 95°C for 30 min), 2 × 106 CFU of heat-killed 
C. albicans (quantified and then killed by incubation at 56°C for 
30 min), 5 g of PPD from M. tuberculosis (TB PPD), 20 g of 
tetanus toxoid, or 180 ng of hemagglutinin from, in equal quanti-
ties, an A/California/7/2009 H1N1-like strain, an A/Texas/50/20122 
H3N2-like strain, and a B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like strain. One 
negative control well was treated with complete medium to adjust 
for non–antigen-specific background cytokine production. Cells were 
then incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. After 2 hours, 1 l of brefeldin A 
(BD GolgiPlug; BD Biosciences) and 1 l of monensin (BD GolgiStop; 
BD Biosciences) were added to each well, and the plate was incubated 
for a further 16 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Flow cytometric analyses
For phenotypic analysis, PBMCs were washed before being stained for 
viability and surface phenotype. For intracellular cytokine analysis, 
PBMCs were washed, stained for viability and surface phenotype, 
and, following fixation and permeabilization, stained for intracellular 
cytokine production.
Details of the antibodies that were used are presented in Supple-
mentary Materials and Methods. Cells were washed, resuspended, 
and stored in the absence of light at 4°C until data were acquired

using a FACSAria III flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Compensation 
beads (BD Biosciences) were used to create compensation matrices, 
and sequential cell isolation was used to identify populations of interest 
(Figs. 1 and 3). For phenotypic analysis, values were expressed as the 
median fluorescence intensity. For intracellular cytokine analysis, the 
frequency of each population positive for each cytokine above back-
ground was multiplied by the geometric MFI for each cytokine-positive 
population—this well-established metric is known as the iMFI (44). 
Full details are presented in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistical analyses
Paired comparisons were made using Wilcoxon matched-pairs 
signed-rank test using Prism v6 (GraphPad). P values are two-tailed 
and considered significant at P < 0.05.
Linear DAPC models were used to predict volunteer vaccination 
status. DAPC models were created using the package adegenet (45) 
within R (46). The optimal number of principal components for each 
model was calculated via cross-validation. Cross-validation split the 
data into a training set (comprising 90% of the data) and a validation 
set (comprising 10% of the data). The validation set was changed 
through random sampling and was classified by the model produced 
from the training set. This procedure was repeated 1000 times for 
every number of retained principal components, and the lowest 
number of principal components with the highest proportion of 
correct predictions was selected. This resulted in 24 principal com-
ponents being retained for each model.
