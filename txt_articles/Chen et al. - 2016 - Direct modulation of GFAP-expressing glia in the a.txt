Abstract Multiple hypothalamic neuronal populations that regulate energy balance have been
identified. Although hypothalamic glia exist in abundance and form intimate structural connections
with neurons, their roles in energy homeostasis are less known. Here we show that selective Ca2+
activation of glia in the mouse arcuate nucleus (ARC) reversibly induces increased food intake while
disruption of Ca2+ signaling pathway in ARC glia reduces food intake. The specific activation of
ARC glia enhances the activity of agouti-related protein/neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY)-expressing
neurons but induces no net response in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons. ARC
glial activation non-specifically depolarizes both AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons but a strong
inhibitory input to POMC neurons balances the excitation. When AgRP/NPY neurons are
inactivated, ARC glial activation fails to evoke any significant changes in food intake. Collectively,
these results reveal an important role of ARC glia in the regulation of energy homeostasis through
its interaction with distinct neuronal subtype-specific pathways.

Introduction
The central nervous system comprises an elaborate network of neuronal populations that have been
identified to control energy homeostasis (Morton et al., 2006; Pang and Han, 2012). This extensive
network includes neural circuits that operate within (Aponte et al., 2011; Atasoy et al., 2012;
Jennings et al., 2013; Klo
¨ckener et al., 2011; Krashes et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2013; Vong et al.,
2011; Yamanaka et al., 2003) and beyond (Georgescu et al., 2005; Hommel et al., 2006;
Zhan et al., 2013) the hypothalamus. Of these, the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) is
most actively studied. The key components of the feeding circuit in ARC have been identified to
comprise agouti-related protein/neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY)-expressing neurons and pro-opiomela-
nocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons (Aponte et al., 2011; Atasoy et al., 2012; Krashes et al.,
2011; Zhan et al., 2013), although an earlier study (Kong et al., 2012) suggests other cell types
may function as additional regulators. In particular, little is known about the functional role of glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing glia that co-exist in the same brain circuit as these
neurons.
Glia represent a major cell population in the brain, with their numbers at least equaling those of
neurons. Traditionally viewed as passive support elements, recent research has unraveled their

 important roles in the modulation of multiple physiological functions (Chen et al., 2012;
Gourine et al., 2010; Halassa et al., 2009; Nedergaard et al., 2003; Schummers et al., 2008).
GFAP-expressing hypothalamic glia, particularly astrocytes, have extensive structural connections
with neurons (Horvath et al., 2010) and also express the receptor for the satiety hormone, leptin
(Cheunsuang and Morris, 2005; Hsuchou et al., 2010, 2009; Jayaram et al., 2013; Kim et al.,
2014; Pan et al., 2008) and for insulin (Garcı
´a-Ca
´ceres et al., 2016). Another type of GFAP-express-
ing hypothalamic glia, tanycytes, are interestingly glucosensitive and are activated by transmitters
related to arousal and feeding (Bolborea and Dale, 2013; Dale, 2011; Rodrı
´guez et al., 2005).
These findings suggest a potential role of glia in the regulation of energy homeostasis, thereby
opening up several key questions: Do GFAP-expressing hypothalamic glia play a role in the regula-
tion of feeding? Do they functionally interact with AgRP/NPY and/or POMC neurons? If so, how
does manipulation of glia in ARC affect food intake and feeding behavior? Here we demonstrate
that direct and acute glial activation in the mouse ARC facilitates the activity of AgRP/NPY but not
POMC neurons and is sufficient to reversibly evoke feeding. In the presence of AgRP/NPY neuronal
inactivation, acute ARC glial activation did not evoke any change in feeding. In addition, disruption
of Ca2+ signaling in ARC glia leads to reduced food intake. This reveals an important role of ARC
glia-AgRP/NPY neuron circuit in the regulation of energy homeostasis.
Results
Selective expression and activation of DREADDs in ARC glia
To acutely activate glia in vivo, we selectively expressed designer receptors exclusively activated by
designer drugs (DREADDs) (Alexander et al., 2009; Armbruster et al., 2007) in GFAP-expressing
glia in ARC of C57BL/6 adult mice. This was achieved by stereotaxic injection in ARC with an adeno-
associated virus (AAV) containing a Gfap promoter-driven gene that encodes the evolved human
M3-muscarinic receptor fused to mCherry (hM3D(Gq)-mCherry) (Figure 1A). The hM3D(Gq) couples
to the Gq protein-mediated signaling to activate glia upon binding of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO).
CNO is an exclusively specific ligand of DREADD (Agulhon et al., 2013) and is inert when used at
low concentrations (see CNO dose experiments in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D). Successful
bilateral viral injection in ARC was confirmed by localized expression of mCherry (Figure 1B). The
eLife digest Neurons in an area of the brain called the hypothalamus control how much an
animal eats. However, it is not clear what role other brain cells, such as glial cells, might play in
influencing feeding. Glial cells do not send nerve impulses like neurons, but instead they mostly
serve to support and protect the neurons.
Now, Chen et al. changed the activity of a particular kind of glial cell, known as astrocytes, to
explore what effect this has on how much mice eat. Astrocytes are unique amongst glial cells
because they can respond to neuronal activity and release chemicals that change the activity of
other cells, including neurons.
The experiments revealed that switching astrocytes on in the hypothalamus made mice eat more,
while turning them off had the opposite effect and reduced feeding. Chen et al. also found that glial
cells partner with and change the activity of a particular group of neurons, known as the AgRP/NPY-
expressing neurons. These neurons were already known to increase feeding activity when they
become more active.
In contrast, Chen et al. showed that glial cells do not affect the activity of another group of
neurons, known as POMC-expressing neurons. Previous research had shown that mice eat less when
their POMC-neurons are more active.
Together the findings reveal that, within the hypothalamus, an interaction between glial cells and
neurons influences how much an animal will eat. Further work is now required to understand the
exact interaction between the glial cells and neurons, and to find out if other kinds of glial cells also
have a role in controlling feeding.

 hM3D(Gq)-mCherry was selectively expressed in glia and not in neurons. This was evidenced by the
co-localization of mCherry with anti-GFAP (Figure 1C) and anti-S100B (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 1A: 93.9% of mCherry-expressing cells (n = 401/430 cells in 12 animals) were immunopositive
for S100B) but not with anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN) immunohistochemistry stains (Figure 1D). There
was also no expression of mCherry in specific neuronal sub-types: orexigenic AgRP/NPY neurons
and anorexigenic POMC neurons in Npy-hrGFP and Pomc-EGFP mice respectively (Figure 1—figure

mals) did not express mCherry). The hM3D(Gq)-mCherry glial population comprised both astrocytes
and tanycytes that line the third ventricle (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B: 14.9% of the mCherry-

 expressing cells co-localized with anti-vimentin, a marker for tanycytes (n = 80/512 mCherry-express-
ing cells in 4 animals). In vivo injections of CNO (0.3 mg/kg) (Koch et al., 2015; Krashes et al.,
2011, 2013; Pei et al., 2014) induced significantly greater Fos immunoreactivity (Palkovits et al.,
2007; Ramı
´rez et al., 2015) as compared to saline injections in ARC astrocytes (Figure 1E–F: n = 95
mCherry-expressing astrocytes in 5 animals each for saline and CNO groups, p=0.0114, unpaired t-
test, comparing averaged responses across astrocytes in each saline- and CNO-injected animal) but
not in tanycytes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). CNO, but not saline application in ARC slices
(Figure 1G) also evoked robust Ca2+ responses in hM3D(Gq)-mCherry-expressing astrocytes
(Figure 1H–I: n = 42 mCherry-expressing astrocytes in 3 animals each for saline and CNO groups,
p=5.49E-16, unpaired t-test, comparing averaged responses across astrocytes in the saline- and
CNO-injected animals). A greater complexity of astrocytic processes was also observed in CNO-
injected animals as compared to saline-injected animals (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F).
Notably, the physiological activation of ARC during fasting also induced Fos immunoreactivity in
ARC astrocytes and neurons but not in tanycytes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G). A greater com-
plexity of astrocytic processes was also observed in fasted animals as compared to fed animals (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1H–J). These data suggest that activation of hM3D(Gq)-mCherry in
astrocytes can induce both the functional and morphological changes observed during physiological
activation of astrocytes after fasting. Collectively, these results confirm the specific and selective
expression and activation of hM3D(Gq)-mCherry in ARC glia (mainly astrocytes), thereby allowing
investigation of the functional effects of physiological activation of ARC glia.
Acute activation of ARC glia reversibly induces increased food intake
To assess the effect of ARC glial activation on feeding, we compared the food intake of viral-
injected, ad libitum fed mice in custom-designed cages (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) on days
with CNO injection to that under control conditions. The control conditions included (1) cage accli-
matization without injection (baseline), (2) with saline injection before CNO injection (pre-CNO
saline) and (3) after CNO injection (post-CNO saline). The comparison of food intake following saline
and CNO injections allowed the same animal to be used as its own control (Figure 2A), since CNO,

(Agulhon et al., 2013). The CNO dose was selected to be 0.3 mg/kg (Koch et al., 2015;
Krashes et al., 2011, 2013; Pei et al., 2014) for all experiments, as concentration experiments in
control mice with low (0.3 mg/kg) and high (5 mg/kg) (Yang et al., 2015) CNO concentrations
revealed non-specific inhibition of food intake at high but not low CNO concentration (Figure 2—
figure supplement 1B–D). Saline or CNO injections were performed at 09:00, 2 hr after the start of
light phase when mice were in a calorically replete state. Feeding measurements were made
between 09:00–17:00. Interestingly, the average total food intake during days of CNO administra-
tion was about three- to four-fold greater than that during baseline, pre-CNO saline and post-CNO
saline (Figure 2B: p<0.0001, n = 11 animals, unpaired t-test comparing total food intake during
three days of CNO with that during three days of baseline, three days of pre-CNO saline and four
days of post-CNO saline). This feeding response was reversible and reproducible across repeated
CNO administration in the same animal (Figure 2B), suggesting that glial activation may serve as an
intrinsic regulatory mechanism of food intake.
The CNO effect was also time-dependent when the population and trial-averaged food intake at
specific time points between 09:00 and 17:00 during CNO and saline administration were examined.
The time course revealed increased food intake within 30 min post CNO injection with peak feeding
within 1 hr post injection. This effect persisted for at least 3 more hours (Figure 2C: n = 11 animals,
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Drug: p<0.0001, F(2,30) = 19.0; Time: p<0.0001, F(8,240) =
9.71; Interaction between drug and time: p<0.0001, F(16,240) = 11.6; see also Figure 2—figure sup-
plement 1E). At peak feeding, the food intake was more than 13 times greater than that during
saline administration (Figure 2C). It is worth mentioning that CNO administration evoked increased
food intake within 3 hr post CNO application in the dark phase when majority of food intake occurs
(Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C). The total food intake in the 8 hr of dark phase was however
not significantly different between CNO and saline application (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D).
This may be due to a ceiling effect in the drive to feed when glia may already be activated at night
(see section below).

expressed 2–3 weeks post viral injection before acclimatization in custom cages for 3–7 days (baseline) and to saline injection for three days (pre-CNO
saline). CNO injections were repeated for three days, each separated by two days of saline injection (post-CNO saline) to allow the CNO effects to
clear. All injections were performed at 09:00 while the food intake was measured at specific time points between 09:00–17:00. All mice were housed in
custom cages between 09:00–17:00 and returned to the standard cages after 17:00 daily. (B) Total food intake between 09:00–17:00 during baseline,

 We next compared the percentage of time viral-injected mice spent at the food chamber relative
to other areas of the cage after CNO and saline administration (Figure 2D). The average percentage
of time that mice spent at the food chamber following CNO administration was significantly greater
than that following saline administration in the same mice (Figure 2D: n = 11 animals, ANOVA,
Drug: p<0.0001, F(1,20) = 47.8; Time: p<0.0001, F(8,160) = 26.6; Interaction between drug and time:
p<0.0001, F(8,160) = 22.7, comparing the population and trial-averaged time spent at food chamber
at specific time points between 09:00 and 17:00 during pre-CNO saline and CNO administration).
The same was true for the frequency of food seeking attempts (Figure 2E: n = 11 animals, ANOVA,
Drug: p=0.003, F(1,20) = 11.4; Time: p<0.0001, F(8,160) = 17.2; Interaction between drug and time:
p<0.0001, F(8,160) = 10.1, comparing the population and trial-averaged frequency of attempts at spe-
cific time points between 09:00 and 17:00 during pre-CNO saline and CNO administration). CNO
administration also increased the frequency of shorter-duration feeding attempts and increased the
maximum duration of the feeding episodes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). Collectively, these
observations suggest that glial activation can trigger mice to devote greater time for feeding.
A trend of increased CNO-induced food intake was observed with increased size of hM3D(Gq)-
mCherry expression in the ARC (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). In mice lacking hM3D(Gq)-
mCherry expression in ARC due to failed viral injection attempts (identified in post hoc analysis) (Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 4) as well as mice injected with the control virus AAV-Gfap-mCherry in
ARC (Figure 2—figure supplement 5), CNO administration did not increase food intake. Although
glial activation resulted in the pronounced feeding response, DREADD activation of glia did not lead
to changes in the body weight (Figure 2—figure supplement 6).
Collectively, these data support an active role of ARC glia in the modulation of feeding behavior
and suggest that direct glial activation is sufficient to evoke acute feeding even during the daytime
when the mice are normally resting and in calorically replete state.
Disruption of Ca2+ signaling pathway in ARC glia reduces food intake
The presence of activated ARC astrocytes during fasting (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G) sug-
gests that glia may play a critical role in modulating feeding under physiological conditions. To
address this question, we assessed the effect of reduced ARC glial activity on feeding by first inject-
ing an AAV comprising a Gfap promoter-driven gene that encodes the pleckstrin homology (PH)

 domain of phospholipase C (PLC)-like protein p130 (p130PH) fused with mRFP (AAV-Gfap-p130PH-
mRFP) in ARC. Glial expression of the p130PH construct was previously shown to disrupt the Ca2+
signaling in astrocytes in vivo by acting as a mobile cytosolic IP3 buffer to inhibit release of Ca2+
from internal stores (Xie et al., 2010). Control animals were injected with AAV-Gfap-mRFP without
the p130PH construct (Figure 3A). We compared the Fos activity of mRFP-expressing, S100B-posi-
tive ARC glia in the AAV-Gfap-p130PH-mRFP and AAV-Gfap-mRFP (control) injected animals after
fasting. Indeed, the Fos activity of astrocytes in the AAV-Gfap-p130PH-mRFP injected animals was
significantly lower than that in the control animals (Figure 3B,C: p130PH: n = 847 mRFP-expressing
astrocytes, Control: n = 508 mRFP-expressing astrocytes, 8 animals each, p=0.0264, unpaired t-test,
comparing averaged responses across astrocytes in each Gfap-p130PH-mRFP and control animal).
The Fos activity of tanycytes, however, was not significantly different between the experimental and
control groups (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). The Fos activity of neurons was significantly
lower in experimental than in control animals (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B), suggesting possi-
ble glial-neuronal modulation (see below).
We then compared the food intake of the Gfap-p130PH-mRFP-injected animals and control ani-
mals during both dark and light phases. Interestingly, the population and trial-averaged food intake

tion of food intake during the dark phase was not compensated by an increase in food intake in the

 figure supplement 1C). Collectively, these findings support an essential role for glia in the modula-
tion of feeding during physiological conditions.
Acute activation of glia facilitates the activity of AgRP/NPY neurons
but not POMC neurons
There is emerging evidence that astrocytes are integral components of brain circuits linked to spe-
cific brain functions and are capable of modulating neuronal responses (Eroglu and Barres, 2010;
Halassa and Haydon, 2010). It is thus possible that the activation of DREADD-expressing glia can
consequently modulate nearby ARC neurons to contribute to the observed evoked feeding
behavior.
To test if this mechanism underlies the glial activation-induced increase in feeding, we investi-
gated the potential role of the glial modulation of AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons. We first injected
the hM3D(Gq)-mCherry virus in the ARC of Npy-hrGFP mice and Pomc-EGFP mice. Next, we per-
formed ex vivo whole-cell current clamp recordings from NPY neurons (GFP-positive neurons in
Npy-hrGFP mice) and POMC neurons (GFP-positive neurons in Pomc-EGFP mice) in brain slices con-
taining hM3D(Gq)-mCherry-expressing ARC glia (Figure 5A). Interestingly, CNO activation of the
hM3D(Gq)-mCherry-expressing ARC glia depolarized and/or increased the firing rate of AgRP/NPY
neurons (Figure 5B,C: n = 15 neurons in 15 slices from 9 animals, p<0.0001, unpaired t-test, com-
paring CNO-induced responses with null responses; averaged resting membrane potential: �52.2 ±
2.65 mV [van den Top et al., 2004]). In POMC neurons, CNO did not induce a significant response
at a population level (Figure 5B,C: n = 14 neurons in 14 slices in 6 animals, p=0.370; unpaired t-test,
comparing CNO-induced responses with null responses; averaged resting membrane potential: -
44.1 ± 2.09 mV [Cowley et al., 2001]). These findings were further validated by first injecting both
Npy-hrGFP and Pomc-EGFP mice (with hM3D(Gq)-mCherry-expressing ARC glia) with either CNO or
saline before performing Fos immunohistochemistry. Indeed, greater Fos immunoreactivity was
observed after CNO injection as compared to saline injection in NPY but not POMC neurons
(Figure 5D–E,F: n = 5 Npy-hrGFP animals each for CNO and saline injections, p=0.0428, unpaired t-
test, comparing CNO and saline induced responses; n = 5 and n = 6 Pomc-EGFP animals for CNO
and saline injections respectively, p=0.736, unpaired t-test, comparing CNO and saline induced
responses). Collectively, these observations show that direct and acute activation of ARC glia facili-
tates the activity of AgRP/NPY but not POMC neurons.
To confirm that the CNO-evoked facilitatory responses in NPY neurons indeed have an astrocytic
origin, we performed chelation of astrocytic Ca2+ by patch-clamping electrophysiologically charac-
terized astrocytes (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A) with the cell-impermeable Ca2+ chelator 1,2-
Bis(2-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N0,N0-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). The spread of BAPTA within the
local syncytium of astrocytes through gap junctions (Jourdain et al., 2007), visualized by including
Alexa Fluor 633 (A633) in the patch pipette, was confirmed to be about 200 mm from the patched
astrocyte after 20–50 min of dialysis (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Indeed, BAPTA chelation of
Ca2+ in hM3D(Gq)-mCherry-expressing ARC astrocytes blocked the CNO-evoked depolarization in
NPY neurons (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–D: Control: n = 15 neurons in 15 slices in 9 animals,
BAPTA: n = 5 neurons (patched after BAPTA dialysis of astrocyte syncytium) in 5 slices in 3 animals,
p=0.0050, unpaired t-test, comparing responses in the absence and presence of BAPTA dialysis).
Together these findings demonstrate that astrocytic Ca2+ activation contributes to NPY neuronal
facilitation.
POMC neurons receive inhibitory inputs that mask the facilitation
induced by ARC glial activation
Although we have observed preferential activation of AgRP/NPY neurons over POMC neurons dur-
ing ARC astrocytic activation, it is unclear how this cell-type specific modulation arises. Is this due to
the intimate organization between astrocytes and specific neuronal subtypes? Or do astrocytes indis-
criminately facilitate both AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons but their net responses shaped by the
presence of a strong AgRP to POMC inhibition (Atasoy et al., 2012)? To dissect these possibilities,
we first recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) from POMC neurons during
CNO activation of hM3D(Gq)-mCherry-expressing ARC glia. Indeed, CNO evoked an increase in the
frequency (but not amplitude) of sIPSCs in POMC neurons (Figure 6A top, 6B: n = 7 neurons in 7

 slices in 3 animals, Amplitude: p=0.324; Frequency: p=0.0078, paired t-test, comparing normalized
responses before and after CNO application). This observation reveals strong inhibition received by
POMC neurons during glial activation, possibly via NPY neuronal activation. To test if facilitatory
responses in POMC neurons evoked by glial activation can be unmasked when the strong inhibition
they receive is blocked, we recorded the CNO-evoked responses in POMC neurons in the presence
of GABA receptor (GABAR) blockers (50 mM Picrotoxin, a GABAA receptor antagonist and 20 mM
SCH-50911, a GABAB receptor antagonist, see Materials and methods: Slice physiology). Interest-
ingly, CNO evoked strong depolarization in POMC neurons when patched in the presence of
GABAR blockers (Figure 6A bottom, Figure 6C: Control: n = 14 neurons in 14 slices in 6 animals,
GABAR blockers: n = 7 neurons in 7 slices in 5 animals, p=0.0046, unpaired t-test, comparing
responses between in the absence and presence of GABAR blockers). These data support our
hypothesis that astrocytic activation facilitates both AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons indiscriminately.
Unlike AgRP/NPY neurons, however, the presence of a strong inhibitory input, possibly due to the
activation of AgRP/NPY-POMC inhibitory connection (Atasoy et al., 2012) during glial activation,
can further shape the net responses of POMC neurons. Our data thus suggest that ARC glial activa-
tion indiscriminately facilitates both AgRP/NPY neurons and POMC neurons but the presence of an
inhibitory input leads to no net response in POMC neurons, thereby providing a mechanistic under-
standing of the glial activation-induced increase in feeding.
Acute activation of ARC glia while inactivating AgRP/NPY neurons does
not increase food intake
To test if AgRP/NPY activation is necessary for glial activation-induced increase in feeding, we mea-
sured the food intake during simultaneous activation of ARC glia and inactivation of AgRP/NPY neu-
rons. This was achieved by stereotaxic injection of both AAV-Gfap-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry and AAV-

 hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry in the ARC of Agrp-Ires-cre mice that allows selective expression of
hM3D(Gq)-mCherry in ARC glia and hM4D(Gi)-mCherry in AgRP/NPY neurons (Figure 5—figure
supplement 2A–B). The food intake of these viral-injected, ad libitum fed mice was then compared
on days with CNO and saline injections (Figure 5—figure supplement 2C).
The average total food intake (Figure 5—figure supplement 2D) as well as population and trial-
averaged time course of food intake (Figure 5—figure supplement 2E) during days of CNO admin-
istration were not significantly different from those during saline administration. This finding that
AgRP/NPY activation is required to mediate the glial activation-induced increase in feeding further
establishes the crucial role of the ARC glia-AgRP/NPY circuit in the regulation of energy balance.
Discussion
Our work shows that ARC glial activation enables increase in food intake via AgRP/NPY neurons.
Interestingly, ARC glial activation facilitates both AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons. Unlike AgRP/NPY
neurons, however, the responses in POMC neurons are further shaped by an inhibitory input, possi-
bly due to activation of the AgRP/NPY neuron-POMC neuron inhibitory pathway (Atasoy et al.,
2012). The individual POMC neuronal responses are variable (see Figure 5c), suggesting varying rel-
ative strengths of the astrocyte-POMC and astrocyte-AgRP/NPY-POMC pathways. These competing
pathways, however balance, revealing no significant response at the population level. Our findings
show that although glial cells interact with distinct neuronal subtypes non-specifically, it can confer
neuronal subtype-specific modulation through direct modulation of distinct neuronal circuits. This
may be a common mechanism to explain the glial-neuronal subtype specific modulation observed in
other brain regions (Perea et al., 2014).
The lack of astrocyte-neuronal subtype wiring also suggests that glial activation may modulate
other neuronal subtypes within the ARC. This thus opens the possibility of glial modulation of energy
expenditure-promoting neurons in ARC e.g. GABAergic RIP-Cre neurons which do not overlap with
the POMC and AgRP/NPY neuronal population (Kong et al., 2012) and can potentially prevent the
expected body weight gains during AgRP/NPY neuronal activation (Krashes et al., 2011). This may
explain the absence of weight changes during ARC glial modulation observed in our study (Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 6, Figure 3—figure supplement 1C).
There are a few possible mechanisms that may underlie the non-specific, glial activation-stimula-
tion of AgRP neurons and POMC neurons. These include: (1) astrocytic release of glutamate or
D-serine gliotransmitters (Halassa et al., 2007; Haydon and Carmignoto, 2006; Parpura and
Zorec, 2010; Scofield et al., 2015; Volterra and Meldolesi, 2005); (2) regulation of extracellular
transmitters (Pannasch et al., 2014) or extracellular potassium (Wang et al., 2012) possibly through
changes in the activity of transporters in the astrocyte membrane (Bazargani and Attwell, 2016).
Further investigation is required to dissect these possibilities.

(Allen and Barres, 2009; Bazargani and Attwell, 2016; Fields and Burnstock, 2006; Lalo et al.,
2006), possibly evoked by active AgRP/NPY neurons in the presence of a strong drive to feed
(Chen et al., 2015; Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015). This, together with the strong glial-neuronal
interactions observed in our work (Figure 5A–C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, Figure 3B–C,
Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) suggest modulation of feeding by bidirectional communication
(Allen and Barres, 2009) between glia and neurons. Direct glial modulation by orexigenic molecules
(Murphy and Bloom, 2006) such as ghrelin via astrocytic ghrelin receptors (Garcı
´a-Ca
´ceres et al.,
2014) may also be a possible mechanism to glial activation.
We manipulated glial Ca2+ activity bi-directionally with viral-mediated Gq-DREADD technology
(Agulhon et al., 2013; Armbruster et al., 2007) and viral-mediated p130PH disruption of glial Ca2+
signaling (Xie et al., 2015, 2010). Both methods allow local and specific manipulation of Ca2+ -
signaling pathway of glia in ARC. The Gq-DREADD technology mimics acute activation of astrocytic
GPCRs that triggers Ca2+ activation (Agulhon et al., 2013, 2008) while the p130PH technology ena-
bles disruption of the endogenous PLC/IP3 glial Ca2+ signaling (Li et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2015,
2010) during physiological feeding states. We have concerns using the Gi-DREADD technology to
manipulate glial activity. Although the Gi-DREADD technology has been shown to inhibit neuronal
firing via induction of hyperpolarization and inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter release
(Roth, 2016), it is unclear whether Gi-DREADD can affect glial activity or glial Ca2+ signaling

 pathways as these cells are electrically non-excitable and do not fire action potentials. In addition,
existing work that activated Gi-coupled GPCR pathways in glia do not reveal any blockade of both
astrocytic activity and astrocyte-neuronal modulation (Agulhon et al., 2012). Indeed, we did not
observe any effect of glial Gi-DREADD activation on feeding (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).
Previous work has provided evidence that support the role for astrocytes in feeding. This includes
experiments showing chronic modification of feeding by synaptic remodeling (Horvath et al., 2010)
during conditional deletion of astrocytic leptin receptors (Kim et al., 2014) (see also Jayaram et al.,
2013) as well as observation of reactive gliosis (Horvath et al., 2010) and activation of astrocytic
inflammatory signaling pathways after feeding of high fat diet (Buckman et al., 2015). These studies
however do not address the question of whether direct glial-activation can evoke acute changes in
feeding. The behavioral changes in feeding in these studies also cannot be solely isolated to the
hypothalamus due to body-wide deletion of leptin receptors in GFAP-expressing cells (expression of
GFAP (Apte et al., 1998; Buniatian et al., 1998; Nolte et al., 2001) and leptin receptors
(Bjørbaek and Kahn, 2004; Gautron and Elmquist, 2011) occur in both the central nervous system
and periphery). Our work directly addresses these gaps in knowledge by demonstrating a causal
relationship between arcuate glia and acute as well as chronic modulation of food intake. We also
further provide mechanistic evidence to explain how glial activation can differentially modulate
AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons through direct modulation of distinct neuronal pathways and demon-
strate the necessity of active AgRP/NPY neurons in mediating the glial activation-induced feeding.
A previous study (Yang et al., 2015) investigating glial regulation of feeding by using the CNO-
DREADD system reported distinct conclusions from our study. We attribute the differences to the
use of different CNO doses and show that a high CNO dose (5 mg/kg) used in that study
(Yang et al., 2015) can in fact induce non-specific inhibition in feeding (see Figure 2—figure sup-
plement 1B–D), possibly due to CNO-induced ataxia (Sigma-Aldrich’s toxicological studies [Sigma-
Aldrich, 2016]).
Our work, together with previous findings, collectively demonstrates a critical role of glia in the
regulation of feeding and further establishes ARC as an important site of glial-mediated regulation.
These findings also imply a possible causal link between increased ARC glial Ca2+ during astrogliosis
(Kanemaru et al., 2013) and hyperphagia during ARC inflammation (Dorfman and Thaler, 2015).
Future work in this area may reveal glia as a possible target of therapeutic intervention.

Food intake and feeding behavior studies
Ad libitum fed mice were transferred from their standard cages to the open-top, custom-designed
cages (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) daily during the duration of the study. Each cage con-
tained a food chamber, a drinking spout (water bottle external to the cage), mouse igloo and sterile
gauze to substitute the removed bedding. The mouse igloo was positioned opposite to the food
chamber in each cage and served to be an alternative location for rest and play. The weight of the
food chamber was taken at specific time points using a weighing balance (CAS MWP-300N, 300 g,
0.01 g precision). In some experiments, measurements were taken after intraperitoneal injections of
saline or clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, C0832, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 09:00 (Figure 2B-E, Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 1E–F, Figure 2—figure supplements 4–5, Figure 5—figure supplement
2), 19:00 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D, Figure 6—figure supplement 1) or 22:00 (Figure 2—
figure supplement 2). The feeding behavior was continuously recorded during the experiments with
web cameras (Logitech, Newark, CA) positioned above the cages and the open source iSpy webcam
software (iSpyConnect, Perth, Australia). Mice were transferred back to the standard cages after
these experiments. CNO was administered at 0.30 mg/kg of body weight (see Figure 2—figure sup-
plement 1B–D) while saline was given at the same volume as control.
Post behavior experiment localization of viral expression and
immunohistochemistry
At the conclusion of the behavior study, all mice were perfused and the fixed brains were sectioned
and imaged to confirm the stereotaxic accuracy of the viral injection site. Some of the sectioned sli-
ces were immunostained to verify the expression specificity of hM3D(Gq)-mCherry in glia. Perfusion:
Mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M PBS followed by
chilled 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS. The brains were then postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
in 0.1 M PBS (<4˚C) overnight. Fixed brains were sectioned into 50–70 mm coronal slices (containing
ARC) with a vibratome. Localization of viral expression: The fixed slices were mounted on a glass
slide with the Vectashield Hardset mounting media (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). The slides were
imaged using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal Exciter,Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany)
and the images were analyzed for localization of mCherry (Figures 1–2, Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 2) or mRFP (Figures 3–4) expression in ARC. Anti-GFAP/Anti-S100B and anti-NeuN immuno-
histochemistry: The fixed slices were blocked in 10% normal goat serum with 0.5% triton in PBS
(1 hr,
room
temperature)
before
being
stained
with
mouse
anti-GFAP
(1:400,MAB360;
Millipore, Billerica, MA) or mouse anti-S100B (1:600, S2532; Sigma) and rabbit anti-NeuN (1:250,
ABN78; Millipore) in blocking buffer overnight (at 4˚C). This was followed by a 3-hr incubation in
Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (1:200, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, A11029) and Alexa Fluor 488
goat anti-rabbit (1:250, Invitrogen, A11034) in 1% normal goat serum and 0.3% triton, before being
mounted on a glass slide with mounting media. Confocal imaging was performed and the images
were analyzed for presence of co-localization of mCherry/mRFP and GFAP /S100B (Figure 1C,E,
Figure 3B, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, Figure 5—figure supplement 2B), absence/presence
of co-localization of mCherry and NeuN (Figure 1D, Figure 5—figure supplement 2B).

 Anti-Fos immunohistochemistry and morphological analysis of glia
Mice were perfused 2 hr post CNO/saline injection or 16–18 hr post initiation of fasting in fasted ani-
mals. The brains were post-fixed in paraformaldehyde over 2 nights before being sectioned into
100 mm coronal slices. The fixed slices were first incubated in 1.2% Triton-X-100 for 15 min before
being blocked in 5% normal goat serum with 2% BSA and 0.2% Triton-X-100 in PBS (1 hr, room tem-
perature). For anti-Fos immunohistochemistry, the slices were then incubated in blocking buffer con-
taining rabbit anti-Fos (1:1000, PC38; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and in some experiments with
mouse anti-S100B (1:600, S2532; Sigma) overnight at 4˚C. For morphological analysis of glia, slices
were incubated in blocking buffer containing rabbit anti-GFAP (1:400, G9269, Sigma) overnight at
4˚C. This was followed by a 2-hr incubation in blocking buffer containing Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-
rabbit (1: 1000, Invitrogen, A21245) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (in some anti-Fos immuno-
histochemistry experiments, 1:1000, Invitrogen, A11001) as well as 0.3 mM DAPI in PBS before being
mounted on a glass slide with mounting media. Confocal imaging was performed with similar optical
parameters for all slices imaged to ensure fair comparisons.
For anti-Fos immunohistochemistry experiment, MetaMorph Basic Offline (v. 7.7.0.0, Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, California) was used for image quantification. Individual astrocytic glial cells
were identified by the S100B and in some cases with mCherry/mRFP labeling (Figure 1E-F,
Figure 3B–C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1G) while NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons were identi-
fied by their GFP expression (Figure 5D-F). In some cases, putative neurons were identified by DAPI
and their lack of S100B and/or mRFP labeling (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G and Figure 3—fig-
ure supplement 1B). Tanycytic glial cells were identified by their location along the third ventricle
next to the ARC (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, Figure 3—
figure supplement 1A) and mCherry/mRFP labeling (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, Figure 3—
figure supplement 1A). These cells were then circled manually before the mean Fos signal for each
cell was computed. Normalized Fos values were computed by normalizing raw Fos signal by the
averaged Fos signal across control cells.
For morphological analysis of glia (Reeves et al., 2011), ARC glia with clear soma and processes
were identified by GFAP labeling (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, Figure 1—figure supplement
1H) and in some cases with mCherry expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). Image stacks in
1 mm planes were then collected under 60x oil objective with 2x digital zoom. The glial cells were
10–90 mm from the surface. Image stacks were traced and 3D-reconstructed using the Neurolucida
software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). The coordinate files generated by the reconstruction were
further analyzed by Sholl analysis using Neuroexplorer software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT). Vir-
tual circles at increasing radii of 3.9 mm increments were drawn from the soma of each glia. The total
length of GFAP-labeled processes passing through each circle and the number of intersections of
processes with each circle were quantified (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–1F, Figure 1—figure
supplement 1I–J)
Anti-vimentin immunohistochemistry
100 mm coronal fixed slices, prepared as described above, were stained with mouse monoclonal
anti-vimentin (2 mg/ml, DSHB Hybridoma Product 40E-C, deposited to DSHB (Iowa City, Iowa) by
Alvarez-Buylla, Arturo) followed by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (1:1000, Invitrogen, A11001).
Food intake and behavior analysis
The amount of food intake during a specific time segment for each mouse was computed by sub-
tracting the weight of the food chamber at the beginning of the time point by that at the end of the
time point. The time segment for total food intake was from 09:00–17:00 (Figure 2B, Figure 2—fig-
ure supplement 4C) or 09:00–13:00 (Figure 2—figure supplement 5C) or 09:00–15:00 (Figure 5—
figure supplement 2D) or 19:00–23:00 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C) or 22:00–06:00 (Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 2D). The total food intake data was averaged across animals (Figure 2B,
Figure 2—figure supplement 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 4C, Figure 2—figure supplement
5C, Figure 5—figure supplement 2D, Figure 6—figure supplement 1C) as well as averaged across
trials and animals (Figure 2C, Figure 4, Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E, Figure 2—figure sup-
plement 2B–C, Figure 2—figure supplement 4D–E, Figure 2—figure supplement 5D, Figure 5—
figure supplement 2E, Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–E). Processing of the videos was done

 using in-house code written in MATLAB (Natick, MA). The average percentage of time spent at the
food chamber was computed as (total time spent at the chamber in the time segment)/(total dura-
tion in the time segment)*100% for each animal before taking the average across trials and animals
(Figure 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 4F). The average frequency of food-seeking attempts
(/hr) was computed by counting the number of times each mouse approach (and stay) at the food
chamber in the time segment before normalizing the count by the duration of the time segment con-
sidered before taking the average across trials and animals (Figure 2E, Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 4G). The frequency-histogram was computed by binning the food-seeking attempts for all
animals by the duration spent on the food chamber (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F, Figure 2—
figure supplement 4H).
Slice physiology
Coronal brain slices of ARC (300 mm) were prepared from AAV-Gfap-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry injected
Npy-GFP and Pomc-EGFP mice with a vibratome (Leica VT 1200S, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Mice
were anesthetized with Avertin solution (20 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/g body weight) and transcardially per-
fused with 15–20 ml of ice-cold carbongenated (comprising 95% O2/5% CO2, pH 7.33–7.38) cutting
solution containing (in mM): 194 sucrose, 30 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 0.2 CaCl2, 8 MgCl2, 26
NaHCO3, and 10 D-(+)-glucose (360 mOsm). The slices were incubated in artificial cerebral spinal
fluid (aCSF) at 32˚C for 10 min followed by in fresh aCSF at room temperature for at least 1 hr.
These slices were then transferred to a slice recording chamber for electrophysiology. The aCSF con-
tained (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.3 KCl, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 26.2 NaHCO3, 11 Glucose, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2
(pH 7.4, 295–305 mOsm).
Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed with IR-DIC. All recordings were conducted
at room temperature. The electrophysiological current-clamp recordings were filtered at 10 kHz and
sampled at 10 kHz at gain = 1 while that for voltage-clamp recordings were filtered at 2 kHz and
sampled at 10 kHz at gain = 5. The intracellular pipette solution for patching neurons in Figure 5A–
C, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–D, Figure 6A bottom, Figure 6C contained (in mM): 131
KGluconate, 17.5 KCl, 9 NaCl, 1 MgCl2.6H2O, 10 HEPES, 1.1 EGTA, 2 MgATP, 0.2 Na2GTP (pH 7.3,
300 mOsm). The intracellular pipette solution for patching astrocytes in Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 1A contained (in mM): 50 KGluconate, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 13 K2SO4, 2 MgATP, 0.4
NaGTP, 40 BAPTA tetrapotassium salt (sc-202076, Santa Cruz Biotech, Texas, USA) (pH 7.3, 300
mOsm). Alexa Fluor 633 Hydrazide (A633, A30634, ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA) was also
included to allow the observation of the spread of BAPTA in the astrocyte syncytium. The A633 was
imaged with an orange-red excitation filter/far red emission filter. The intracellular pipette solution
for patching neurons in Figure 6A top and Figure 6B contained (in mM): 103 CsCl, 12 Cs-methane-
sulfate, 5 TEA-Cl, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na2GTP, 10 Phosphocreatine, 5 Lido-
caine N-ethyl chloride (pH 7.4, 300 mOsm). Glass pipettes (3–5 MW, KG33, King Precision) were
pulled with a Sutter P-97 puller (Sutter instruments). CNO (10 mM) was applied by pressure injection
with a picospritzer (20 psi, 200 ms). In Figure 6A top, Figure 6B, 2,3-Dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahy-
drobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (10 mM NBQX, ab120045, Abcam, MA, USA) was bath-
applied. In Figure 6A bottom, Figure 6C, picrotoxin (50 mM PTX, 1128, Tocris, Bristol, UK) was
included in the intracellular pipette solution while SCH 50911 (20 mM, 9084, Tocris, Bristol, UK) was
bath applied. In a select number of neurons, both PTX and SCH 50911 were included in the intracel-
lular pipette solution and the data are also included in the population data in Figure 6C. GFP
labeled NPY or POMC ARC neurons were visualized with an Olympus BX61WI microscope
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) coupled with a 40x water immersion lens (Olympus). Recordings were per-
formed with a multiclamp 700B amplifier and digidata 1440A data acquisition system, with pClamp
software in the current-clamp mode. Analysis was performed with the Clampfit 10.2.0.12 software
(Molecular Devices). The input resistances of the AgRP and POMC neurons patched in Figures 5–
6, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–D were comparable and agreed with previous literature
(Fu and van den Pol, 2010). The CNO-induced change in mean Vm in Figures 5C, 6C and Figure 5—
figure supplement 1D was defined as (Averaged membrane potential) after drug - (Averaged mem-
brane potential) before drug where (Averaged membrane potential) was computed as the averaged
membrane potential over 10 s. In Figure 6B, the amplitude and frequency of each event in the 120 s
segment before and after CNO application was quantified before the population average was taken
over all events in the respective segments. The population averaged amplitude or frequency of each

 segment was then normalized by the population averaged amplitude or frequency computed across
events within the 120 s segment before CNO application.
Slice calcium imaging
Coronal brain slices of ARC (300 mm) were prepared from AAV-Gfap-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry injected
C57BL/6 mice as described above. The slices were placed on a porous membrane in a 3.5 mm dish
bathed in carbogenated aCSF. Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM (OGB) dye solution was prepared
by adding 1 ml Pluronic F-127 (20% Solution in DMSO, P3000MP, ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA)
and 49 ml DMSO to 50 mg of OGB (O6807, ThermoFisher Scientific). Bulk loading of the dye solution
was performed by adding 3 ml of this dye solution over the ARC. After incubation at room tempera-
ture in the dark for 40 min, the slices were transferred to fresh aCSF for an additional 30 min before
the experiment.
hM3D(Gq)-mCherry glia in ARC were visualized with an Olympus BX61WI upright microscope
under a 40x/0.80 W Olympus LUMPlanFL N water immersion lens and an Olympus CellSens dimen-
sion (v 1.6)-driven Hamamatsu ORCA-R2 digital CCD camera (C10600). Fluorescence was continu-
ously excited using a Lumen 200/220 (Prior Scientific, MA, USA). OGB1-AM and mCherry were
imaged with a blue excitation filter/green emission filter and a green excitation filter/red emission fil-
ter, respectively. Images were continuously acquired at 1.25 Hz, using 1x1 binning. Images were
saved by the CellSens software as tagged image fileformat files and analyzed with both ImageJ
(NIH) and custom-written MATLAB scripts. Individual cells were circled manually based on the
mCherry expression. The mean fluorescence for each cell was computed from frame to frame, giving
a time-varying intensity signal for each cell. After correction for lamp flicker noise and dye photo-
bleaching, dFF was calculated by subtracting the local corresponding baseline (F) from the peak of
the response to get dF before taking the ratio by F. Increases in dFF in ROIs indicated an increase in
Ca2+ concentration.
Statistics
Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA). Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonfer-
roni post hoc tests and standard two-tailed paired or unpaired t-test were used as indicated in text.
A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant in these studies. Error bars indicate S.E.M.
Blind experiments were performed for the Fos and slice physiology studies. Blind experiments were
not performed for the behavior studies but the same criteria were applied to all allocated groups for
comparisons. No randomization was performed for the study. No statistical methods were used to
predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported to previous publica-
tions (Cowley et al., 2001; Krashes et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2014).
