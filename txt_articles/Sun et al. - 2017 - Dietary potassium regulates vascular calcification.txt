Introduction
Vascular pathology comprises not only remodeling of resistance vessels, but also stiffening of compliance 
vessels. In the Cardiovascular Health Study, a prospective multicenter study of 4,476 men and women at 
65 years of age or older, 79.9% developed increased carotid artery intima and media thickness (1). As large 
arteries stiffen, left ventricular hypertrophy develops, which increases the rate of cardiovascular events (2, 
3). Arterial stiffness has become an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, rep-
resenting an important health problem for the nation as a whole.
Emerging clinical evidence suggests the importance of vascular calcification in aortic stiffening (4–8), and 
vascular calcification is a risk factor that predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes in several diseases, often with 
overlapping vascular complications such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (9). Previously 
considered a passive, unregulated, and degenerative process occurring in the arterial media, vascular calcifica-
tion has now been demonstrated to be a highly regulated process of osteochondrogenic differentiation of vascu-
lar cells (10, 11). We and others have shown that osteogenic differentiation and calcification of vascular smooth 
muscle cells (VSMCs) contribute to vascular calcification in atherosclerosis (12–14). Calcifying VSMCs produce 
extracellular matrix proteins that further accelerate the development of arterial calcification (15, 16). Therefore, 
calcification of VSMCs results in alterations in the molecular and cellular functions of VSMCs, the main cell 
type that determines the vascular tone, and leads to disturbance of the vasculature and arterial stiffening (17).
Epidemiological studies have suggested a role for potassium in the clinical manifestations of cardiovas-
cular disease. Inverse associations between serum potassium levels and risks of chronic kidney disease (18) 
and metabolic syndrome (19) have been documented in patients along with a higher propensity to develop 
cardiovascular calcification. In prospective cohort studies, low serum potassium levels are associated with 
significantly higher risks of cardiovascular mortality compared with patients who had serum potassium 
Vascular calcification is a risk factor that predicts adverse cardiovascular complications of 
several diseases including atherosclerosis. Reduced dietary potassium intake has been linked 
to cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and incidental stroke, although the underlying 
molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using the ApoE-deficient mouse model, we 
demonstrated for the first time to our knowledge that reduced dietary potassium (0.3%) promoted 
atherosclerotic vascular calcification and increased aortic stiffness, compared with normal 
(0.7%) potassium–fed mice. In contrast, increased dietary potassium (2.1%) attenuated vascular 
calcification and aortic stiffness. Mechanistically, reduction in the potassium concentration to 
the lower limit of the physiological range increased intracellular calcium, which activated a cAMP 
response element–binding protein (CREB) signal that subsequently enhanced autophagy and 
promoted vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. Inhibition of calcium signals and 
knockdown of either CREB or ATG7, an autophagy regulator, attenuated VSMC calcification induced 
by low potassium. Consistently, elevated autophagy and CREB signaling were demonstrated in 
the calcified arteries from low potassium diet–fed mice as well as aortic arteries exposed to low 
potassium ex vivo. These studies established a potentially novel causative role of dietary potassium 
intake in regulating atherosclerotic vascular calcification and stiffness, and uncovered mechanisms 
that offer opportunities to develop therapeutic strategies to control vascular disease.

concentrations within the normal range (20, 21). Reduced potassium is associated with cardiovascular 
diseases such as hypertension and chronic heart failure, and appropriate dietary potassium intake improves 
those pathological conditions (22–24). Therefore, serum potassium levels are associated with cardiovascu-
lar health and disease; however, the mechanisms responsible for potassium-regulated cardiovascular com-
plications are not fully understood.
At the cellular level, potassium has been shown to reduce VSMC proliferation (25) and inhibit VSMC 
migration in vitro (26). In animal models, elevation of extracellular potassium levels resulting from 
increased dietary potassium intake attenuated balloon injury–induced neointimal formation in rat carotid 
arteries, possibly through inhibition of proliferation and migration of VSMCs (27). In a population-based 
study, high levels of dietary potassium have been postulated to impair proliferation of VSMCs, and reduce 
monocyte adherence to vessel walls, thereby retarding the progression of atherosclerosis (28). Nonetheless, 
a direct effect of dietary potassium on VSMC osteogenic differentiation and the development of vascular 
calcification in atherosclerosis has not been established and characterized.
In this study, we have provided the first evidence to our knowledge that supports a causative role of 
dietary potassium in regulating osteogenic differentiation and calcification of VSMCs in vitro and vascular 
calcification and stiffness in atherosclerotic animals in vivo. Furthermore, we defined key mechanisms 
underlying low-potassium-induced VSMC calcification involving elevated intracellular calcium, activated 
cAMP response element–binding protein (CREB), and increased autophagy. These findings provide molec-
ular insights into the regulation of vascular calcification and stiffness by potassium, which explain the 
impact of dietary potassium intake on cardiovascular complications, and uncover potentially new targets to 
develop strategies to prevent and treat vascular complications.
Results
Dietary potassium regulated vascular calcification and aortic stiffness in mice. The effect of dietary potassium on 
atherosclerotic vascular calcification was characterized in vivo using the high-fat-fed ApoE–/– mouse model 
(12, 13), with dietary intake of standard (0.7% wt/wt), low (0.3% wt/wt), or high (2.1% wt/wt) potas-
sium, as previously reported (29, 30). Mice fed the 0.3% potassium diet exhibited significant increases in 
vascular calcification, compared with mice fed the 0.7% potassium diet, whereas the 2.1% potassium diet 
markedly inhibited vascular calcification (Figure 1, A and B). The effects of dietary potassium on vascular 
calcification were demonstrated in aortic root sections by Alizarin red staining (Figure 1, A and B), as 
well as descending aortas by total calcium quantification (Figure 1C). It is worth noting that mice fed the 
0.3% potassium diet had lower mean serum potassium levels (3.70 ± 0.21 mEq/l), while mice fed the 2.1% 
potassium diet had higher serum potassium levels (4.73 ± 0.15 mEq/l), compared with levels (4.27 ± 0.23 
mEq/l) observed in mice fed the standard (0.7% potassium) diet (Supplemental Table 1; supplemental 
material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.94920DS1).
In line with our observation of elevated calcium content in the descending aortas, echocardiographic 
analysis revealed that the 0.3% potassium diet induced a significant increase in mean pulse wave velocity 
(PWV) (Figure 1D), an indicator of aortic stiffness (31), suggesting that impaired aortic compliance is 
associated with low dietary potassium–induced vascular calcification. In contrast, compared with animals 
fed the 0.7% potassium diet, animals fed the 2.1% potassium diet exhibited inhibited vascular calcification 
and concurrently reduced PWV
, supporting an important role of dietary potassium in regulating vascular 
calcification and stiffness.
Potassium regulated vascular calcification ex vivo. To determine if there was a direct effect of extracellular 
potassium level on calcification of the arteries and VSMCs in their natural milieu, we employed an ex vivo 
ring culture model that we and others have recently developed for histological and quantitative analysis of 
arterial calcification (32, 33). Based on normal physiological levels of serum potassium in adult C57BL/6 
mice (34–36), we determined the effects of potassium at the lower (3.7 mM, low K+), middle (5.4 mM, 
control), and higher (6.0 mM, high K+) end of the physiological range on aortic calcification. Consistent 
with the in vivo results, we found that low potassium markedly enhanced vascular calcification in the aortic 
media, as demonstrated by Alizarin red staining (Figure 2A), while high potassium inhibited aortic calcifi-
cation. Quantification of total calcium content demonstrated a significant increase in calcification in aortic 
rings cultured in medium containing 3.7 mM potassium, which was inhibited by 6.0 mM potassium (Fig-
ure 2B). These results demonstrated a direct effect of potassium on the calcification of the aortic media, 
supporting the role of low potassium in promoting VSMC calcification.

Lower physiological levels of  potassium induced VSMC osteogenic differentiation and calcification. To 
determine the effects of potassium on VSMC calcification in cell culture, we first assessed the effects 
of extracellular potassium on VSMC viability using potassium at concentrations up to 108 mM, so as 
to identify a nontoxic level of potassium. Consistent with previous observations (37), we found that 
potassium, at concentrations lower than 54 mM, did not affect VSMC viability (Supplemental Figure 
1). However, at concentrations from 3.7 to 4.7 mM, potassium markedly enhanced VSMC calcification 
compared with its concentration at 5.4 mM, as determined by Alizarin red staining of matrix calcium 
(Figure 3A) and total calcium quantification in cell lysates measured by the Arsenazo III method 
(Figure 3B); such calcification did not occur when potassium levels were maintained at 5.7 mM and 
6.0 mM.
We and others have demonstrated that VSMC calcification resembles osteogenic differentiation of 
bone cells (38, 39); therefore, we determined the effect of potassium on the osteogenic differentiation of 
VSMCs, as indicated by the changes in the expression of bone markers and smooth muscle markers (13, 
38). Increased expression of Runx2, a key osteogenic transcription factor that we have determined to be an 
important regulator of VSMC calcification (13, 38), was found to be upregulated by low potassium at both 
protein and mRNA levels (Figure 3, C and D). Consistently, the expression of Runx2-regulated osteogenic 
markers, including osteocalcin (OC) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), were induced (Figure 3D), while 
the SMC marker genes, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and smooth muscle protein 22 α (SM22α), were 
markedly reduced concurrently (Figure 3, C and E). These data indicated a direct effect of low potassium

on promoting VSMC osteogenic differentiation and calcification, via increasing osteogenic markers and 
decreasing SMC markers.
Activation of  intracellular calcium signaling mediated low-potassium-induced VSMC calcification. Potas-
sium deficiency has been shown to increase intracellular calcium in VSMCs (40). As increased intracel-
lular calcium flux has been linked to VSMC calcification (41), we examined whether low potassium 
may induce VSMC calcification via activation of calcium signaling. We found that potassium at a con-
trol condition of 5.4 mM did not affect calcium flux (Figure 4A, dotted line). In contrast, elevation of 
intracellular calcium was evident in VSMCs within minutes after exposure to a low potassium concen-
tration of 3.7 mM; the increase was sustained over the 30-minute duration (Figure 4A). Consistently, 
low potassium induced rapid and heightened activation of several known downstream mediators that 
include protein kinase C (PKC), and calcium-activated CREB (Figure 4B), but did not affect extracel-
lular signal–regulated kinases (ERKs) signaling.
As potassium can be transported via 4 types of potassium channels (42), we determined the roles 
of these channels in mediating low-potassium-induced VSMC calcification. We found that inhibition of 
ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) by glibenclamide, voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv) 
by 4-aminopyridine, and calcium-activated potassium channels (KCa) by TRAM34 and charybdotoxin had 
no effects (Supplemental Figure 2), while inhibition of inward-rectifier potassium channels (KIR) by bar-
ium (43, 44) abolished low-potassium-induced VSMC calcification (Figure 4C). Furthermore, inhibition 
of potassium-activated calcium signaling by calcium channel inhibitors, verapamil and nifedipine, attenu-
ated low-potassium-induced vascular calcification (Figure 4C). Altogether, these results showed that low-
potassium-induced elevation of intracellular calcium signaling mediated its effects on VSMC calcification.
Activation of  calcium signaling-mediated CREB was required for low potassium-induced VSMC calcification. The 
effects of these inhibitors of potassium or calcium channels on calcium signaling–activated downstream signal 
CREB were further determined. Consistent with the inhibitory effects on low-potassium-induced VSMC calci-
fication, the low-potassium-induced activation of CREB in VSMCs was abolished by the KIR inhibitor, barium, 
as well as the calcium channel inhibitors, verapamil and nifedipine (Figure 4D). Furthermore, knockdown of 
CREB using lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shCREB) blocked low-potassium-induced VSMC calcifi-
cation and Runx2 upregulation (Figure 4, E and F), supporting the requirement of intracellular calcium–activat-
ed CREB signaling in mediating low-potassium-induced osteogenic differentiation and calcification of VSMCs.

As activation of CREB signaling was linked to increased autophagy in human melanoma cells and 
liver tissues (45, 46) and elevation of autophagy was demonstrated during osteoblast mineralization (47), 
we determined whether CREB activation may affect autophagy in VSMCs during low-potassium-induced 
calcification. We found that low potassium induced the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 in 
the conjugated form (LC3 II) (Figure 4F), an indicator of autophagy activation (48). CREB knockdown, 
however, markedly inhibited low-potassium-induced elevation of LC3 II (Figure 4F). Consistently, inhibi-
tion of KIR or calcium channels that were upstream of CREB by barium, verapamil, and nifedipine also 
attenuated low-potassium-induced expression of LC3 II (Figure 4G), implying that intracellular calcium–
activated CREB mediates low-potassium-induced VSMC calcification via the regulation of autophagy.
Low potassium promoted VSMC calcification through autophagy. To determine the role of autophagy in low-
potassium-induced VSMC calcification, we first assessed the effects of potassium levels on the expression 
of LC3 II. Increased expression of LC3 II (Figure 5A) was demonstrated in VSMCs exposed to potassium 
at concentrations that induced VSMC calcification (Figure 3A). Quantitative analysis further confirmed an 
increased LC3 II/I ratio by low potassium (Figure 5B), indicating that low potassium activated autophagy 
in VSMCs. In addition, a time-dependent effect of low potassium, at 3.7 mM, in increasing the LC3 II/I 
ratio and autophagy activation was demonstrated (Supplemental Figure 3).
The essential role of autophagy in mediating low-potassium-induced VSMC calcification was initially 
determined utilizing 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy. Pretreatment 
of VSMCs with 3-MA dramatically reduced low-potassium-induced elevation of the LC3 II/I ratio, and 
concurrently blocked VSMC calcification (Figure 5, C and D). Moreover, we generated stable VSMCs with 
shRNA knockdown of ATG7, a key regulator of autophagy formation. Similar to the observations with 
the autophagy inhibitor, the ATG7 knockdown blocked VSMC calcification and inhibited low-potassium-
induced elevation of the LC3 II/I ratio (Figure 5, E and F). These results support a definitive role of low-
potassium-induced autophagy in mediating its effects on promoting VSMC calcification.

Potassium regulated the activation of  CREB and autophagy in vascular calcification ex vivo and in vivo. The roles 
of activation of CREB and autophagy signals in low-potassium-induced vascular calcification were further 
determined in the ex vivo ring culture model and in vivo mouse models. As shown in Figure 6A, low-potas-
sium-induced aortic calcification ex vivo was associated with increased activation of intracellular calcium–
activated signals, including PKC, CREB, and elevation of LC3 II as well as upregulation of the osteogenic 
transcription factor Runx2 (Figure 6A). In contrast, high potassium markedly inhibited the activation of PKC 
and CREB and inhibited LC3 II and Runx2 (Figure 6A). Moreover, increased activation of PKC, CREB, and 
elevation of LC3 II and Runx2 were demonstrated in arteries from low dietary potassium–fed mice (Figure 
6B). Consistently, higher dietary potassium inhibited PKC and CREB activation, and decreased LC3 II and 
Runx2 (Figure 6B). Altogether, these results further supported an important role for potassium in regulating 
vascular calcification via effects on calcium signaling, CREB, and autophagy in VSMCs (Figure 6C).

Discussion
Reduced dietary potassium intake has been linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases, 
including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease; all of these disease share common vascular 
complications, such as vascular calcification. Using in vitro cell culture, an ex vivo tissue model, and in vivo 
atherogenic animals, we have demonstrated that low potassium intake induces VSMC osteogenic differen-
tiation and calcification and promotes atherosclerotic vascular calcification. Concurrently with increased 
vascular calcification, we have found that PWV
, an indicator of arterial stiffness, was increased in animals 
fed a low-potassium diet (Figure 1D), supporting a direct link between low dietary potassium–promoted 
atherosclerotic calcification and arterial stiffness. These observations are consistent with previous studies 
demonstrating that vascular calcification may increase arterial stiffness through the calcification of elastic 
fibers (49, 50). In sharp contrast, increased dietary potassium inhibited atherosclerotic calcification and 
improved vascular stiffness in the ApoE–/– mice. Importantly, the increase in vascular calcification and stiff-
ness caused by the reduced-potassium diet occurred with only a small reduction in mean serum potassium 
concentration, compared with the standard potassium–content diet (3.70 ± 0.21 versus 4.27 ± 0.23 mEq/l; 
P < 0.05). Similarly, increased potassium diets resulted in a small increase in serum potassium concentra-
tion (4.73 ± 0.15 mEq/l; P < 0.05) and was sufficient to reduce vascular calcification in atherosclerosis. Of 
note, lower magnesium levels have been reported to be associated with the presence of vascular calcifica-
tion in clinics (51), as well as in calcification of cultured VSMCs (52). We did not find significant differ-
ences in the serum magnesium levels in the low-potassium-fed animals compared with normal- or high-
potassium-fed animals (Supplemental Table 1). Therefore, results from these studies support a direct effect 
of potassium on the calcification of VSMCs, leading to vascular calcification and stiffness. These find-
ings are consistent with previous observations that reduced dietary intake of potassium is associated with 
increased risk of vascular diseases, such as stroke and hypertension, which were improved by appropriate 
dietary potassium intake (22–24, 53). These studies uncovered a potentially novel causative link between 
low potassium and VSMC osteogenic differentiation and calcification in atherosclerosis.
Our studies have added mechanistic insights into our current understanding of the regulation of 
vascular health and disease by dietary potassium. During the development of atherosclerosis, potas-
sium may regulate multiple cellular processes, as it can affect VSMC proliferation (37), or interplay with 
sodium homeostasis and a number of neurohormonal pathways that regulate blood pressure (54). Our 
findings highlight the importance of dietary potassium–regulated VSMC calcification in atherosclerosis.

The in vitro studies in particular demonstrated a direct effect of extracellular potassium levels on VSMC 
calcification. Although previous studies have shown that potassium reduced VSMC proliferation in vitro 
(25), the effect of low potassium on promoting VSMC calcification was independent of its effects on 
VSMC viability (Supplemental Figure 1), suggesting a previously unknown mechanism. Among the 4 
known potassium channels on VSMCs, we identified that KIR specifically mediated the effects of low-
potassium-induced VSMC calcification. Upregulation of KIR has been reported during osteogenic dif-
ferentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells; however, the role of KIR in the osteogenic process has not 
been defined (55). We found that low potassium initiated VSMC calcification through activation of 
intracellular calcium flux. As KIR was linked to potassium-induced changes in membrane potential of rat 
arteries (43), it is possible that KIR-mediated membrane depolarization leads to the elevation of intracel-
lular calcium via voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in VSMCs. In a meta-analysis combining the 
results of 2 genome-wide association studies, upregulation of CACNA1C, encoding a subunit of the 
VGCC, was associated with patients with calcific aortic valve disease (56), suggesting a role of VGCCs 
in vascular calcification. Furthermore, the VGCC blocker nifedipine was found to inhibit coronary arte-
rial calcification in patients with hypertension (57). Consistently, we found that inhibitors of the KIR or 
VGCCs blocked low-potassium-induced VSMC calcification, which was associated with inhibition of 
low-potassium-induced calcium signals.
We observed a prolonged increment of intracellular calcium in low-potassium-treated VSMCs (Figure 
4A), which was associated with increased VSMC calcification. Intracellular calcium influx resulting from 
depolarization-induced VGCC opening has been associated with SMC differentiation (58). However, a 
long-term increase in intracellular calcium is linked to osteogenic differentiation of SMCs, and inhibi-
tion of intracellular calcium intake by KCa blocker attenuates calcium phosphate–induced VSMC calci-
fication (59). In addition, inhibition of L-type calcium channels by verapamil has been shown to reduce 
VSMC calcification (60). Accordingly, differences in the duration of intracellular calcium flux may lead to 
diverse downstream molecular signals that differentially regulate VSMC physiology and pathology. Unlike 
physiologic intracellular calcium influx that is associated with excitation-contraction of SMCs, sustained 
increase in intracellular calcium may lead to VSMC pathology, such as calcification. Our results with the 
KIR or calcium channel inhibitors have further supported the role of calcium signaling in mediating low-
potassium-induced VSMC calcification.
Low-potassium-induced elevation of intracellular calcium led to the activation of CREB signaling, 
which was required for low-potassium-induced Runx2 upregulation and osteogenic differentiation and

and autophagy signals ex vivo. Aortic rings from wild-type mice were exposed to osteogenic media with control (5.4 
mM), low potassium (3.7 mM, Low K+), or high potassium (6.0 mM, High K+) for 3 weeks. Western blot analysis was 
performed to determine the phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC), CREB, and the expression of microtubule-
associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). Representative blots from 3 
independent experiments are shown. (B) Effects of dietary potassium on the activation of CREB and autophagy signals 
in vivo. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the phosphorylation of PKC, CREB and the expression of LC3 
and Runx2 in descending aortas of control, low, or high potassium diet–fed mice. Representative Western blot analyses 
of protein lysates extracted from the descending aortas from at least 3 mice in each group are shown. (C) Schematic 
illustration of vascular calcification regulated by potassium. Low potassium activates calcium signaling that promotes 
activation of CREB, which results in chronically excessive autophagy in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), leading 
to the development of calcification. High potassium reverses vascular calcification.

calcification of VSMCs. CREB is a target of cAMP signaling and is a widely expressed nuclear transcrip-
tion factor that has been found to mediate the cellular response to metabolic and mitogenic signals (61). 
Activation of CREB signaling has been demonstrated in bone morphogenetic protein 9–induced osteo-
genic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (62). In addition, upregulation of CREB is associated with 
TNF-α–enhanced calcification of bovine aortic SMCs in vitro (63). Results from our studies highlight an 
essential role of CREB in mediating low-potassium-induced VSMC calcification, as knockdown of CREB 
attenuated low-potassium-induced VSMC calcification.
Furthermore, we have established a link between CREB signaling and autophagy in VSMC calcifica-
tion. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved, complex cellular pathway that delivers cytoplasmic con-
tents for degradation in lysosomes (64, 65). Autophagosome-like structures are documented in VSMCs in 
atherosclerotic lesions in human and animal models (66). The present study has provided what we believe 
to be the first evidence that low potassium enhanced autophagy, which promoted VSMC osteogenic dif-
ferentiation in vitro and vascular calcification in atherosclerosis in vivo. Autophagy has been shown to 
induce elastin degradation (67), which could lead to the initiation and progression of vascular calcifica-
tion. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of autophagy by ATG7 knockdown or ATG14 knock-
out reduced osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (68, 69), supporting the critical 
role of autophagy during osteogenic differentiation. The role of autophagy in regulating VSMC function 
appears to be complicated. For instance, inducing autophagy has been shown to protect statin-induced 
cell death of VSMCs in culture (70). On the other hand, excessive autophagy in VSMCs was associated 
with autophagic cell death of VSMCs and plaque destabilization in atherosclerosis (71, 72). Our stud-
ies found that low-potassium-induced autophagy in VSMCs did not affect VSMC viability, but promoted 
VSMC calcification. Accordingly, VSMC autophagy may contribute to atherosclerosis depending on dis-
ease status, location, and the surrounding microenvironment. In phosphate-induced VSMC calcification in 
vitro, autophagy has been shown to play an adaptive role (73–75). Inhibition of autophagy does not block 
high-phosphate-induced VSMC calcification, but increases calcium deposition and enhances vascular cal-
cification. Our studies, however, have demonstrated that low-potassium-induced elevation of autophagy 
promotes vascular calcification in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, different osteogenic stimuli and dura-
tion of autophagy may contribute to the varying responses of autophagy in the development of VSMC 
calcification in these 2 different systems. Of note, a low-potassium-induced LC3 II/I ratio in VSMCs was 
observed after 5 days and sustained even after 21 days of treatment (Supplemental Figure 3), suggesting 
that persistent activation of autophagy may promote VSMC calcification. It is conceivable that acute and 
chronic autophagy formation may regulate distinct underlying molecular mechanisms that promote VSMC 
calcification, further supporting the notion that autophagy plays a complex and often distinct role under 
various pathological conditions. Further investigations with animal models of tissue-specific knockout of 
autophagy components are warranted to define the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of vascular cal-
cification and stiffness in vivo. Nonetheless, our data suggest that the autophagic process may be a viable 
target to develop and design drugs that attenuate vascular calcification and stiffness in atherosclerosis.
In summary, we have determined a causative link between reduced dietary potassium and vascular cal-
cification in atherosclerosis and uncovered the underlying pathogenic mechanisms that integrate enhanced 
intracellular calcium influx, activated CREB signaling, and elevation of autophagy. These findings provide 
molecular insights into the previously unappreciated regulation of vascular calcification and stiffness by 
low potassium intake and emphasize the need to consider dietary intake of potassium in the prevention of 
vascular complications of atherosclerosis.
Methods
Experimental animals. Effects of dietary potassium on pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular calcifica-
tion were determined using the ApoE-deficient (ApoE–/–) mouse model (12, 13). Eight-week-old male 
ApoE–/– mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (HFD, Harlan Teklad 
diet TD88137) containing normal potassium (0.7% wt/wt KCl), low potassium (0.3% wt/wt KCl), or high 
potassium (2.1% wt/wt KCl) for 30 weeks as previously described (29, 30). Both food and fluid intake were 
given ad libitum. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Alabama at Bir-
mingham approved all experimental protocols.
Echocardiography and measurement of  PWV. At the experimental endpoint, echocardiography was per-
formed with the high-resolution imaging system VEVO 2100 (Visual Sonics) to determine PWV as previously

described (76). PWV was calculated as the distance divided by the time interval between the pulse wave at the 
aortic arch and the abdominal aorta (m/s).
Analysis of  serum biochemical parameters. Mouse blood was collected at euthanization, and serum was 
separated from nonheparinized blood and assayed for various minerals, enzymes, and compounds (Supple-
mental Table 1). All the biochemical parameters were determined by Molecular Diagnostic Services, Inc. 
using a Beckman Coulter AU680 analyzer.
Tissue harvesting, processing, and analysis. Heart and aortic tissues were collected, processed, and analyzed 
as previously reported (12, 13, 32, 76). Descending aorta was used for total calcium measurement by the Arse-
nazo III method (Stanbio Laboratory), or protein expression and phosphorylation by Western blot analysis. 
A series of consecutive 7-μm aortic root sections were used for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for 
histology and Alizarin red staining (Sigma-Aldrich) for calcification. Stained sections were examined using a 
Leica M165 FC microscope, and the percentage of positively stained area in each section was quantified using 
ImageJ software (NIH). All quantitative analyses were performed blindly by at least 2 investigators.
Ex vivo aortic calcification. Aortic rings were obtained from descending aortas of wild-type C57BL/6 mice 
(The Jackson Laboratory) as we previously described (32). Calcification of aortic rings was performed as 
previously reported (32), using 3-mm mouse aortic rings cultured in osteogenic media containing 1% FBS 
with low (3.7 mM), normal (5.4 mM), or high (6.0 mM) potassium for up to 3 weeks. Choline chloride, 
which has been used to compensate for the deficit in the extracellular ionic concentration (77–79) and does 
not show any effects on vascular calcification (80), was added to culture media to avoid the changes in osmo-
larity. Total calcium content in the aortic rings was quantified by the Arsenazo III method. The amount of 
calcium was normalized to the dry weight of the tissues and expressed as millimolar/gram dry weight. In 
separate experiments, aortic rings were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin embedded, and consecutive 
7-μm sections were used for H&E and Alizarin red staining as we previously reported (12, 13, 32).
VSMC culture and in vitro VSMC calcification. Primary VSMCs were isolated from descending aortas 
from wild-type C57BL/6 mice and cultured in growth media as described previously (13, 32, 38, 76). All 
experiments were performed with VSMCs at passages 3 to 5. Potassium-free DMEM (10-013-CM) was 
purchased from Mediatech Inc. The potassium concentration in the culture media, from 3.7 mM to 6.0 
mM, was adjusted with potassium chloride (KCl) (Sigma-Aldrich). Choline chloride was added to culture 
media to avoid the changes in osmolarity of low-potassium media.
To determine the effects of potassium level on VSMC calcification, VSMCs were cultured in 
osteogenic media containing 0.25 mmol/l L-ascorbic acid, 10 mmol/l β-glycerophosphate, and 10–8 M 
dexamethasone with different concentrations of potassium for 3 weeks. Calcification was determined 
by Alizarin red staining and quantified by measuring total calcium using Arsenazo III as previously 
described (13, 32, 38, 76).
The effects of pharmacological inhibitors on VSMC calcification were determined by addition of 
nontoxic amounts of the selective inhibitors in the osteogenic media: L-type VGCC inhibitors, verapamil 
and nifedipine (Calbiochem); KIR inhibitor, barium chloride (BaCl) (Sigma-Aldrich); KATP inhibitor, glib-
enclamide (Tocris); Kv inhibitor, 4-aminopyridine (Tocris); KCa inhibitors, TRAM34 and charybdotoxin 
(Tocris); and autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA (Tocris).
VSMC viability. VSMCs were grown in a 96-well plate at 3 × 103 cells per well for 72 hours in osteogenic 
medium containing extracellular potassium, ranging from 1 mM to 108 mM. The effects of potassium on 
VSMC viability was determined by MTS assay, using the MTS Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega) as 
described previously (81).
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The expression of osteogenic and smooth muscle markers in 
VSMCs was determined by real-time PCR as described previously (12, 13, 32, 38, 76). Total RNA was 
isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA. SYBR Green–based real-time 
PCR was performed using specific primers for Runx2, murine ALP, OC, α-SMA, and SM22α, using 
SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad).
Western blot analysis. Protein extraction, protein concentration measurement, and polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis were performed as previously reported (38). Western blot analysis was performed using 
specific antibodies for Runx2 (MBL, D130-3), α-SMA (Sigma-Aldrich, A2547), GAPDH (Fitzgerald, 
10R-G109a), p-ERK (Cell Signaling, 4370), p-PKC (Cell Signaling, 9375), p-CREB (Cell Signaling, 9198), 
LC3 (MBL, M186-3), and total CREB (Cell Signaling, 9104), and ATG7 (Cell Signaling, 8558); and detect-
ed with a chemiluminescence detection kit (Millipore).

Intracellular calcium measurement. Intracellular calcium was measured using a Fluo4 NW calcium 
assay kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, VSMCs seeded on 
96-well black clear-bottom plates (Corning Costar) were preloaded with Fluo4 NW fluorescent dye 
(1 μM) for 30 minutes, and then exposed to growth media containing low (3.7 mM) or normal potas-
sium (5.4 mM). Fluorescence signals were recorded for 30 minutes at 1-minute intervals using the 
fluorescence microplate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 525 nm (Synergy 2, BioTek). 
Intracellular calcium was calculated by subtracting the basal fluorescence intensity from the total fluo-
rescence intensity.
shRNA knockdown in VSMCs. Lentiviral vector carrying shRNA specific for murine CREB, ATG7, or 
control scrambled shRNA (shScr) was purchased from Open Biosystems and packaged into lentiviral par-
ticles as previously described (12). Lentiviral transduction was performed by incubating VSMCs with lenti-
viruses in growth media supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene, and stable transfectants were selected with 
puromycin (2 μg/ml) for 2 weeks.
Statistics. All the data are expressed as means ± SD. For multiple group comparison, 1-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls test was performed. A P value less than 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
Study approval. All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
