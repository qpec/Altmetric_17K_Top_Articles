Key points
r Chronic (psychosocial) stress changes gut microbiota composition, as well as inducing
behavioural and physiological deficits.
r The microbial metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have been implicated in gastro-
intestinal functional, (neuro)immune regulation and host metabolism, but their role in
stress-induced behavioural and physiological alterations is poorly understood.
r Administration of SCFAs to mice undergoing psychosocial stress alleviates enduring alterations
in anhedonia and heightened stress-responsiveness, as well as stress-induced increases in
intestinal permeability.
r In contrast, chronic stress-induced alterations in body weight gain, faecal SCFAs and the
gene expression of the SCFA receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3 remained unaffected by SCFA
supplementation.
r These results present novel insights into mechanisms underpinning the influence of the gut
microbiota on brain homeostasis, behaviour and host metabolism, informing the development
of microbiota-targeted therapies for stress-related disorders.
Abstract There is a growing recognition of the involvement of the gastrointestinal microbiota in
the regulation of physiology and behaviour. Microbiota-derived metabolites play a central role in
the communication between microbes and their host, with short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) being
perhaps the most studied. SCFAs are primarily derived from fermentation of dietary fibres and
play a pivotal role in host gut, metabolic and immune function. All these factors have previously
been demonstrated to be adversely affected by stress. Therefore, we sought to assess whether SCFA
supplementation could counteract the enduring effects of chronic psychosocial stress. C57BL/6J
male mice received oral supplementation of a mixture of the three principle SCFAs (acetate,

propionate and butyrate). One week later, mice underwent 3 weeks of repeated psychosocial
stress, followed by a comprehensive behavioural analysis. Finally, plasma corticosterone, faecal
SCFAs and caecal microbiota composition were assessed. SCFA treatment alleviated psychosocial
stress-induced alterations in reward-seeking behaviour, and increased responsiveness to an acute
stressor and in vivo intestinal permeability. In addition, SCFAs exhibited behavioural test-specific
antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, which were not present when mice had also undergone
psychosocial stress. Stress-induced increases in body weight gain, faecal SCFAs and the colonic
gene expression of the SCFA receptors free fatty acid receptors 2 and 3 remained unaffected
by SCFA supplementation. Moreover, there were no collateral effects on caecal microbiota
composition. Taken together, these data show that SCFA supplementation alleviates selective
and enduring alterations induced by repeated psychosocial stress and these data may inform
future research into microbiota-targeted therapies for stress-related disorders.

Introduction
Chronic stress is a considerable health concern for
society, associated with various disease states including
an increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders like
depression (Yang et al. 2015; Ramirez et al. 2017) and
functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable
bowel syndrome (Stam et al. 1997; Klooker et al.
2009; Moloney et al. 2016). Stress-related disorders have
complex and multifactorial aetiologies and trajectories.
Recent years has seen a growing interest in the potential
contribution of microbiota–gut–brain axis signalling
in both the aetiology and treatment of stress-related
disorders (Foster et al. 2017; Rea et al. 2017). For
instance, preclinical studies have revealed that chronic
stress results in an altered gut microbial composition
(Bailey et al. 2011; Bharwani et al. 2017; Burokas et al.
2017;Galleyetal.2017;Marinetal.2017;Szyszkowiczetal.
2017; Dunphy-Doherty et al. 2018). In addition, various
microbiota-targeted interventions are able to ameliorate
chronic stress-induced deficits in mice, which include
the administration of live bacterial strains (probiotics)
(Bharwani et al. 2017; Marin et al. 2017), as well as
the supplementation of host-indigestible dietary fibres
that are fermented by the gut microbiota (prebiotics)
(Burokas et al. 2017). Importantly, predictive analysis of
functional microbiota pathways reveals that chronic social
defeat stress resulted in a lower representation of pathways
involved in fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis,
particularly involved in the metabolism of propanoate–
and butanoate–conjugate bases of the short-chain fatty
acids (SCFAs) propionate and butyrate (Bharwani et al.
2016).
The primary source of endogenous SCFAs is the gut
microbial fermentation of host-indigestible dietary fibres,
with the principal SCFAs being acetate, propionate and
butyrate (Koh et al. 2016). These SCFAs have been
shown to affect the host through multiple mechanisms
including the regulation of histone acetylation and
methylation (Krautkramer et al. 2016; Stilling et al. 2016),
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Milligan et al.
2017), facilitating the secretion of various hormones (e.g.
GLP-1 and PYY) and neurochemicals (e.g. serotonin)
(Chambers et al. 2015; Reigstad et al. 2015), and the
induction of vagus nerve signalling (De Vadder et al. 2014;
Li et al. 2017). SCFAs are also used as a mitochondrial
energy source resulting in an extremely rapid uptake of
these compounds in both humans and rodents (Egorin
et al. 1999; Schonfeld & Wojtczak, 2016; Boets et al.
2017). It is therefore essential to emphasise that physio-
logically relevant levels of acetate and propionate have
been reported to directly influence the brain (Perry et al.
2016; Hoyles et al. 2018). Considering the plethora of
ways in which they can affect the host, it’s not surprising
that SCFAs have been implicated in numerous physio-
logical functions such as gastrointestinal functionality,
host metabolism, blood-pressure regulation, circadian
rhythm and (neuro)immune function (Koh et al. 2016;
Erny et al. 2017; Pluznick, 2017; Tahara et al. 2018). Gut
microbial-derived SCFAs are also increasingly implicated
in emotional processing and behaviour, as butyrate
has been shown to ameliorate cognitive impairments
in a model of vascular dementia and in mid-adult
high-fat-diet-induced obese mice (Liu et al. 2015;
Arnoldussen et al. 2017), and propionate is able to
reduceanticipatoryrewardresponsestohigh-energyfoods
in the human striatum (Byrne et al. 2016). Finally,
correlations between SCFA levels and depressive-, anxiety-
and stress-related behaviours have been reported after pre-
biotic administration (Burokas et al. 2017). Considering
that these behavioural parameters are negatively affected
by chronic (psychosocial) stress (Yang et al. 2015;

Ramirez et al. 2017), we hypothesised that SCFA
supplementation could ameliorate these psychosocial
stress-induced behavioural deficits.
As such, we investigated whether oral SCFA supple-
mentation could ameliorate psychosocial stress-induced
behavioural deficits in mice, specifically in sociability,
anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours, cognition and
stress-responsiveness. In parallel, we assessed changes in
the expression of associated genes in discrete brains
regions. Finally, we investigated the role of gut permea-
bility and gut microbiota composition in SCFA-induced
amelioration of psychosocial stress-induced behavioural
deficits.
Methods
Ethical approval
All
experiments
were
approved
by
the
Animal
Experimentation Ethics Committee of University College
Cork and conducted in accordance with the European
Directive
86/609/EEC
and
the
Recommendation
2007/526/65/EC. The animal experiments conducted also
comply with the policy and regulations of The Journal
of Physiology (Grundy, 2015). All efforts were made to
reduce the number of animals used and minimise animal
suffering. Samples sizes were based on previous studies
(Burokas et al. 2017).
Animals
This study used male C57Bl/6J mice (n = 40; 8 weeks of age
on arrival; Harlan, UK; n = 10 per group). Animals were
habituated for 4 weeks after which single housing began.
Food and water were provided ad libitum throughout the
study. The holding room was under a 12-hour light/dark
cycle (lights on at 07.00 h), with a temperature of 21 ± 1°C
and humidity of 55 ± 10%. Body weight was monitored
twice per week starting at the onset of psychosocial stress.
Experimental timeline and behavioural testing
Oral SCFA treatment commenced 1 week after the single
housing, both of which continued throughout the entire
study (Fig. 1). After 1 week of SCFA treatment, animals
underwent 3 weeks of psychosocial stress followed by a
behavioural assessment. Behavioural tests were performed
in order of least stressful to most stressful to lessen the
likelihood of prior behavioural tests influencing sub-
sequent ones. In addition, there was a minimum of 36 h in
between each test. Testing was performed in the following
order: (1) social interaction test; (2) sucrose preference;
(3) three-chamber social interaction; (4) female urine
sniffing; (5) open field; (6) novel object recognition; (7)
marble burying; (8) elevated plus maze; (9) stress-induced
hyperthermia;(10)tailsuspension;(11)fear conditioning;
(12) hot plate; (13) in vivo FITC-dextran intestinal
permeability; (14) forced swim. These tests were followed
by a 1 week washout period, after which mice were killed
by decapitation.
Oral short-chain fatty acid administration
A mix of the three principal short-chain fatty acids
– sodium acetate (67.5 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, S7545),
sodium propionate (25 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, P1880) and
sodium butyrate (40 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, 303410) – was
administered via drinking water (pH 7.6) as described

Figure 1. Experimental design of the short-chain fatty acid treatment, psychosocial stress and
behavioural assessment
After 1 week of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) treatment, animals underwent a 3-week psychosocial stress protocol
containing intermittent social defeat and overcrowding procedures. Mice subsequently underwent behavioural
assessment, starting with the least stressful test to the most stressful test. The order of the behavioural tests
was as follows. Week 4: social interaction test (SIT) and sucrose preference test (SPT); week 5: three-chamber
sociability test (3-CT) and female urine sniffing test (FUST); week 6: open field (OF), novel object recognition test
(NOR) and marble burying test (MB); week 7: elevated plus maze (EPM), stress-induced hyperthermia test (SIH) and
tail-suspension test (TST); week 8: fear conditioning (FC) and hot plate test (HPT); week 9: FITC-dextran intestinal
permeability test (FITC); week 10: forced swim test (FST); week 11: sacrifice. SCFA treatment was for the entire
duration. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

water was refreshed two times per week.
Psychosocial stress – social defeat and overcrowding
procedures
The social defeat and overcrowding procedure schedule
was performed for 3 weeks as previously described (see
Fig. 1 Finger et al. 2011; Burokas et al. 2017). For the social
defeat procedure, age-matched male CD1 mice (n = 30;
Harlan, UK) were tested for aggression on three individual
days. Briefly, CD1 mice were exposed to another CD1
intruder mouse in their home cage until the first attack
commenced. The 25 CD1 mice with the shortest attack
latencies were used for the social defeat procedure, while
the rest were used in the social interaction test. Test mice
undergoing psychosocial stress were pseudo-randomly
assigned to a different CD1 mouse on each day, counter-
balanced by the SCFA group. During the social defeat
procedure, stress mice were gently placed in the home
cage of the CD1 aggressor and allowed to interact until
the first attack of the CD1 mouse took place, which was
followed by a defeat posture of the stress mouse. Mice
were then separated for 2 h by a perforated Plexiglass
divider allowing for auditory, olfactory and visual, but not
physical contact. The divider was subsequently removed,
after which another social defeat took place, and test mice
were placed in their original home cage. For the over-
crowding procedure, stress mice of one group (n = 10)
were housed in a standard holding cage for 24 h. During
this period, control mice were left undisturbed.
Social interaction test
The social interaction test was used to assess avoidance of
the CD1 aggressors 1 day following the final psychosocial
stressor and was conducted as previously described
(Burokas et al. 2017). The test was performed in an open
arena (40 × 32 × 24 cm, L × W × H) containing an empty
wire mesh cage (9.5 × 7.5 × 7.0 cm) opposed to one side.
The test consisted of two 2.5 min trials, with a 1 min inter-
trial interval, wherein mice were allowed to explore the
arena freely. In the first trial (‘no target’), the wire mesh
cage was left empty, whereas an unfamiliar CD1 aggressor
was placed in the wire mesh cage in the second trial. Both
micewerereturnedtotheirhomecageafterthetest,andthe
arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol. To reduce potential
anxiogenic factors, all mice were habituated 45 min before
testing, and testing was conducted in red light (5 lux).
All trials were videotaped using a ceiling camera and
analysed for time spent in the interaction zone using
Ethovision version 13 software (Noldus). Social avoidance
was calculated by dividing the time spent in the interaction
zone in trial 2 by the time spent in the interaction zone in
trial 1.
Sucrose preference test
Mice were assessed for hedonic-like behaviour using the
sucrose preference test, which was conducted as previously
described (Kelly et al. 2016). Mice were presented with two
drinking water bottles, one containing regular drinking
water and the other one a sucrose solution (2% w/v), for
48h.Thesidetowhicheachdrinkingwaterbottlewasfixed
was randomised and alternated every 12 h. Mice were kept
in their home cages throughout the test, and the same
type of drinking water bottles were used in subsequent
tests. Sucrose preference was calculated using the formula:
(total sucrose intake/total fluid intake) × 100%.
Three-chamber sociability test
The three-chamber sociability test was used to assess social
preference and recognition and was conducted as pre-
viously described (Desbonnet et al. 2014). The testing
apparatus was a three-chambered, rectangular box. The
dividing walls between each chamber (20 × 40 × 22 cm,
L × W × H) had small circular openings (5 cm diameter),
allowing for access to all chambers. The two outer
chambers contained wire cup-like cages (10 cm bottom
diameter, 13 cm H), allowing for auditory, olfactory and
visual, but not physical contact. The test consisted of three
10 min phases: (1) habituation, (2) social preference,
(3) social recognition. In the first phase (habituation),
mice were allowed to explore the entire box with both
wire cup-like cages left empty to allow for habituation
to the novel environment. In the second phase (social
preference), one wire cup-like cage contained a novel,
age-matched, conspecific, male mouse, whereas the other
cage contained an object (rubber duckie). In the third
phase (social recognition), the mouse of the previous trial
was left in the wire cup-like cage (familiar mouse), while
the object was replaced with a conspecific mouse (novel
mouse). The test mouse was held in the middle chamber
while the conspecific mouse and object were placed in the
cup wire-like cages. The location of the conspecific mice
andobjectweresystemicallyalteredbetweentestmice.The
three-chamber test apparatus and wire cup-like cages were
cleaned with 10% ethanol after each test mouse and left
to dry for a few minutes. To reduce potential anxiogenic
factors,allmicewerehabituatedtothetestingroom40min
before the test, the floor of the testing arena was covered
with sawdust and testing was performed under dim light
(60 lux). All experiments were videotaped using a ceiling
camera and were scored blinded for the time interacted
with the wire cup-like cages.

Female urine sniffing test
Mice were assessed for hedonic and reward-seeking
behaviour in the female urine sniffing test, which was
performed as previously described (Finger et al. 2011).
Before this experiment, vaginal smears from age-matched
female C57Bl/6 mice (n = 12; Harlan, UK) were taken and
assessed for the oestrous cycle. Urine from female mice
in the oestrous stage was collected and pooled. Male mice
were habituated 45 min before the start of the test to the
test room, with a cotton bulb attached to the lid of their
housing cage. The test mice were subsequently introduced
to a new cotton bulb containing 30 μl sterile water. After a
45 min intertrial interval, mice were introduced to a new
cotton bulb containing 30 μl urine from a female mouse
in oestrous for 3 min. The experiment was conducted in
red light (5 lux). All tests were videotaped using a ceiling
camera for 3 min and interaction time with the cotton
bulbs was scored blinded.
Open field test
Mice were assessed for their locomotor activity and
response to a novel environment in the open field test,
which was conducted as previously described (Burokas
et al. 2017). Mice were placed in an open arena
(40 × 32 × 24 cm, L × W × H) and were allowed to
explore the arena for 10 min. Animals were habituated to
the room 1 h before the test. Testing was performed under
dim light (60 lux). Experiments were videotaped using a
ceiling camera and were analysed for time spend in the
virtual centre zone (defined as 50% away from the edges)
and total distance travelled using Ethovision version 13
software (Noldus).
Novel object recognition test
The day after the open field test, mice were allowed
to explore two identical objects (acquisition phase),
after which one object was replaced on the third day
(retention phase). Like the open field test, testing was
performed under dim light (60 lux) and lasted 10 min.
Mice were habituated to the room 1 h before the test.
Experiments were videotaped using a ceiling camera and
time of directed contact of the mouse with the objects
on day three (retention phase) was scored blinded by an
independent researcher. Object preference was calculated
using the following formula: (novel object exploration
time – familiar object exploration time)/total exploration
time × 100%.
Marble burying test
Mice were tested for repetitive and anxious behaviour
with the marble burying test, which was conducted
as previously described (Burokas et al. 2017). Animals
were individually placed in a novel Plexiglas cage
(35 × 28 × 18.5 cm, L × W × H), which was filled with
sawdust (5 cm) and had 20 marbles placed on top (5 × 4
rows, equally spread between the walls and individual
marbles). After mice had spent 30 min in the cage, the
number of buried marbles was counted by two researchers
and averaged, which was defined as 2/3 of the marble not
anymore being visible.
Elevated plus maze
The elevated plus maze test was used to assess anxiety-like
behaviour, which was conducted as previously described
(Burokas et al. 2017). The elevated plus maze apparatus
consisted of a grey cross-shaped maze with two open arms
and two closed arms (50 × 5 × 15 cm walls or 1 cm no
wall), elevated 1 m from the floor. Mice were allowed to
explore the maze for 5 min. Experiments were conducted
in red light (5 lux). Mice were habituated to the room
1 h before the test. Experiments were videotaped using a
ceiling camera and videos were scored blinded for time
spent in the open arms, which was defined as all paws in
the open arm.
Stress-induced hyperthermia test
The stress-induced hyperthermia test was used to assess
stress-responsiveness, which was conducted as previously
described (Burokas et al. 2017). Body temperature was
taken at baseline (T1) and 15 min later (T2) by gently
inserting a sterile, Vaseline-covered thermometer 2.0 cm
into the rectum. The temperature was noted to the nearest
0.1°C after it stabilised (�10 s). Mice were restrained by
scruffing during this procedure which was the stressor.
Animalswerehabituatedtothetestingroom30minbefore
the test. The difference between T1 and T2 reflected the
stress-induced hyperthermia.
Tail-suspension test
The tail-suspension test was used to assess depressive-like
behaviour, which was conducted as previously described
(Burokas et al. 2017). Mice were hung by their tail
using adhesive tape (2 cm from the tip of the tail) to
a 30 cm-elevated grid bar for 6 min. Experiments were
videotaped using a numeric tripod-fixed camera and
videos were scored blinded by an independent researcher
for the time spent immobile.
Fear conditioning
Mice were assessed for fear-associated contextual and
cued learning in the fear conditioning test, which was

conducted as previously described (Burokas et al. 2017).
This test consisted of three phases: (1) acquisition, (2)
retention, (3) extinction, each of which was carried out
on successive days with a 24 h interval. The acquisition
phase consisted of a 3 min baseline recording, followed
by 6 tone-conditioned stimuli (70 dB, 20 s) and shock
pairings (0.6 mA, 2 s) with a 1 min interval. During the
retention and acquisition phases, the same experimental
procedure was carried out in the absence of the shocks.
The fear conditioning apparatus was cleaned with 70%
ethanol and left to dry for a few minutes between runs.
Hot plate test
The hot plate test was used to assess somatic pain response,
which was conducted as previously described (Tramullas
et al. 2012). Animals were gently placed on a hot plate
(Stoelting) set at 52°C. After mice licked their front paw,
they were immediately removed from the hot plate and
returned to their homecage. Animals were habituated
60 min to the room before the test. Experiments were
videotaped using a numeric tripod-fixed camera and
videos were scored blinded for the time it took the mice to
lick either of their front paws.
In vivo FITC-dextran intestinal permeability test
Gastrointestinal permeability was assessed using the
FITC-dextran intestinal permeability test, which was
conducted as previously described (Scott et al. 2017).
Mice were fastened overnight and received an oral gavage
of FITC-dextran dissolved in sterile PBS (Sigma, FD4)
at 09.00 h. The administered dosage was 600 mg kg−1
body weight, and the approximate volume administered
per mouse was 0.21 ml. Two hours after the FITC-dextran
was administered, approximately 90 μl of whole blood
was taken by tail-tip. For this procedure, the end of the tail
was held with two fingers without restraining the mouse.
A 2–4 mm long diagonal incision was made at the end
of the tail using a single edge razor blade, and blood was
collected in an EDTA-containing capillary. Blood was then
transferred to a tube, centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 g at
4°C, and plasma was collected and stored at −80°C for
later analysis. Plasma FITC-dextran concentrations were
assessed with a multi-mode plate reader (Synergy HT,
BioTek Instruments) with an excitation of 490 nm and
emission of 520 nm.
Forced swim test
The forced swim test was used to assess depressive-like
behaviour, which was conducted as previously described
(Cryan & Mombereau, 2004). Mice were individually
placed in a transparent glass cylinder (24 × 21 cm
diameter) containing 15-cm-depth water (23–25°C) for
6 min. Mice were gently dried after the test, and water was
discarded and renewed after each animal. Experiments
were videotaped using a ceiling camera and videos
were scored blinded by an independent researcher for
immobility time in the last 4 min of the test.
Plasma sampling for corticosterone
Plasma from each animal was sampled by tail-tip 5 min
before the forced swim test and repeatedly after the test in
30 min intervals up to 120 min. For the tail-tip, the end
of the tail was held with two fingers without restraining
the mouse. A 2–4 mm long diagonal incision was made
at the end of the tail using a single edge razor blade.
Approximately 40 μl of whole blood was taken per time
point using an EDTA-containing capillary, deposited in
an Eppendorf and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 g at
4°C. Plasma was collected and stored at −80°C for later
analysis.
Tissue collection
Animals were killed by decapitation in a random fashion
regarding testing groups between 09.00 h and 15.00 h.
Trunk blood was collected in EDTA-containing tubes
and centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 g at 4°C. Plasma
was collected and stored at −80°C for later analysis.
The caecum, spleen, adrenals and thymus were removed,
weighed, snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C.
Proximal colon tissue was either immediately frozen
on dry ice and stored at −80°C for later noradrenalin
quantification by HPLC, or stored in RNAlater (Sigma,
R0901) for 48 h at 4°C, after which the RNAlater was
removed, and tissues were stored at −80°C for later
gene expression analysis. The brain was excised and
gross-dissected as described previously (Schellekens et al.
2012). Brain tissues were then stored in RNAlater and
processed in the same manner as colon tissues.
Plasma corticosterone and lipopolysaccharide-binding
protein quantification
Corticosterone quantification of plasma samples (15 μl)
obtained in the forced swim test was performed using a
corticosterone ELISA (Enzo Life Sciences, ADI-901-097),
and was carried out according to the manufacturer’s
guidelines.Lipopolysaccharide-bindingprotein(LBP)was
quantified in plasma (10 μl) obtained when animals were
killed using an ELISA (Enzo Life Sciences, ALX-850-305),
and was also performed according to the manufacturers’
instructions. A multi-mode plate reader (Synergy HT,
BioTekInstruments)wasusedtomeasurelightabsorbance
in both assays.

Gene expression analysis
Total mRNA was isolated using the mirVana miRNA
Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, AM1560), after
which samples were DNase treated (ThermoFisher
Scientific, AM1907). RNA was determined using the
NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific)
and synthesised into cDNA using the High Capacity
Reverse Transcription cDNA kit (ThermoFisher Scientific,
4368814). Gene expression analysis was finally carried
out by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) using various probes designed by Applied
Biosystems and Integrated DNA Technologies (Table 1).
The

(ThermoFisher Scientific, 4440040) was used. Singleplex
amplification reactions were performed in duplicates in
384-well plates on the LightCycler 480 system. Data were
normalised using Actb as endogenous control and trans-
formed using the 2−��CT method. All procedures were
carried out according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
DNA extraction from caecal contents and Illumina
MiSeq sequencing
Total DNA was extracted from thawed caecal contents
using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen,
51604), coupled with an initial bead-beating step (Fouhy
et al. 2015). Briefly, a 0.2 g aliquot of caecal sample was
added to 0.4 g of zirconia beads together with 1 ml
InhibitEx buffer supplied in the kit. Samples were sub-
sequently homogenised using the Biospec Minibeadbeater
for 3 min. Removal of RNA and protein, as well as
purification of the DNA, was completed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, DNA was stored at
-20°C until further analysis.
The 16S metagenomic sequencing library protocol
(Illumina) was used to amplify the V3-V4 variable
region of the 16S rRNA gene from the DNA extracts.
Briefly, DNA was amplified with V3-V4 region-specific
to

template, 5 μl forward primer (1 μM), 5 μl reverse
primer (1 μM), 12.5 μl 2× Kapa HiFi Hotstart ready
mix (Anachem) and PCR grade water to a final volume
of 25 μl. PCR amplification was carried out as follows:
initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min; 25 cycles of 95°C
for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s; 72°C for 5 min and
held at 4°C. PCR products were then visualised using gel
electrophoresis (1× TAE buffer, 1.5% agarose, 100 V)
and cleaned using AMPure XP magnetic bead-based
purification (Labplan). A second PCR reaction was
performed on the purified DNA (5 μl) to index each of
the samples, allowing samples to be pooled for sequencing
on the one flow cell and finally demultiplexed for analysis.
Two indexing primers (Illumina Nextera XT) were used
per sample. Each PCR reaction contained 5 μl index 1
primer (N7xx), 5 μl index 2 primer (S5xx), 25 μl 2× Kapa
HiFi Hot Start Ready mix and 10 μl PCR grade water. PCR
was mostly carried out as described above, although only
eight amplification cycles were completed instead of 25.
PCR products were visualised using gel electrophoresis
and subsequently cleaned (as described above). Samples
were quantified using the Qubit (Bio-Sciences) along

with the high sensitivity DNA quantification assay kit
(Bio-Sciences), and samples were pooled in an equimolar
fashion. The pooled samples were run on the Agilent
Bioanalyser for quality analysis. The sample pool was
prepared following Illumina guidelines. Samples were
sequenced on the MiSeq sequencing platform (Clinical
Microbiomics, Denmark), using a 2 × 250 cycle kit,
following standard Illumina sequencing protocols.
Bioinformatic sequence analysis was performed as
described previously (Murphy et al. 2017). Briefly,
paired-end sequences were assembled using FLASH
(Magoc & Salzberg, 2011), and analysed using QIIME
v1.8.0 (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology)
(Caporaso et al. 2010). Sequences were then quality
checked, and the remaining sequences were clustered into
operational taxonomic units using USEARCH (v7-64bit)
(Edgar, 2010). Taxonomic ranks were assigned with a
BLAST search against the SILVA SSURef database release
116 (Quast et al. 2013). Alpha and beta diversities
were generated in QIIME and calculated based on
weightedUnifracdistancematrices(Lozuponeetal.2011).
Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots were made
using EMPeror v0.9.3-dev (Vazquez-Baeza et al. 2013).
The relative abundance of bacterial taxa was expressed as
a percentage of identified sequences.
Faecal SCFA quantification
Faecal pellets were collected 6 weeks post psychosocial
stress. Faecal water was prepared by homogenising the
faecal samples (approx. 200 mg) with 800 μl of 0.003 M
HCl and 3 zirconia beads for 10 min using a vortex mixer.
The use of HCl results in the acidification of samples
ensuring protonation of SCFAs before analysis, which
prevents the occurrence of split peaks in chromatograms
(Zhao et al. 2006). Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 g
for 5 min, after which supernatants were syringe filtered
with 0.22 μM filters (Corning) and duplicate aliquots of
270 μL of filtrate were mixed with 30 μL of 10 mM inter-
nal standard. Samples were subsequently homogenised
briefly and were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 3 min. The
supernatant was transferred to 250 μL inserts (Agilent)
placed in amber glass 2 mL GC vials (Agilent) sealed with
silicone/PTFE screw caps (Agilent).
Samples were analysed by gas chromatography flame
ionisation detection (GC-FID) using a Varian 3800
GC system, fitted with a Zebron ZB-FFAP column
(30 mL × 0.3 2 mm ID × 0.25 μm df; Phenomenex) and
a flame ionisation detector with a CP-8400 auto-sampler.
Helium was employed as the carrier gas at an initial flow
rate of 1.3 mL min−1. The initial oven temperature was
50°C and was maintained for 30 s, then raised to 140°C at
10°C min−1 and held for 30 s. The temperature was finally
increased to 240°C at 20°C min−1 and held for 5 min.
The temperatures of the detector and the injection port
were 300°C and 240°C respectively. A split-less injection
of 0.2 μL was carried out for each sample or standard
using a 10 μL syringe (Agilent) installed to a CP-8400
auto-sampler (Varian). Peak integration was carried out
using Varian Star Chromatography Workstation version
6.0 software. Vials containing 1800 μL of water were run
between each sample duplicates as blanks to check for any
potential carryover. Standards were included in each run
to maintain the calibration.
Statistical analysis
All
data
were
assessed
for
normality
using
the
Shapiro-Wilk test and Levene’s test for equality of
variances. Normally distributed data were analysed using
a two-way ANOVA, followed by Fisher’s least significant
difference (LSD) post hoc test. Non-parametric datasets
were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed
by the Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical analysis was
performed using SPSS software version 24 (IBM Corp).
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. A P value <0.05 was
deemed significant.
Results
Social behaviour
Threeweeksofpsychosocialstressinducedatrendtowards
decreased social interaction with a CD1 mouse used in
the social defeat sessions (Fig. 2A), independently of
SCFA treatment (X2(1) = 2.875, P = 0.090). Mice were
later assessed for their preference between a conspecific
mouse or an object in the three-chamber sociability test.
All groups exhibited a significant preference towards the
conspecific mouse compared to the object (Fig. 2B).
Changing the object to a novel conspecific mouse to test
for social recognition, resulted in a significant preference
towards interacting with the novel conspecific mouse for
all test groups (Fig. 2C).

spent in the centre of the open field (X2(3) = 15.622,

mice underwent psychosocial stress. These effects were
independent of locomotor activity, as no differences
in the total distance travelled were found in the open
field test (Fig. 3B). Nonetheless, no effects were found
in other tests assessing anxiety-like behaviours like the
marble burying test (Table 2) and the elevated plus maze
(Table 2). Assessment of depressive-like behaviour using

the tail-suspension test did not reveal any significant
differences (Table 2), even though mice supplemented
with SCFAs exhibited a decreased immobility time in the
forced swim test (F(1,38) = 5.548, P = 0.024) (Fig. 3C).
Surprisingly, no significant stress effects, independently of
SCFAs, were found in any of the tests assessing anxiety-
and depressive-like behaviour.
Hedonic and reward-seeking behaviour
Assessment of hedonic and reward-seeking behaviour
using the sucrose preference test revealed that stressed
mice had an increased sucrose preference (Table 2), which
was not seen following SCFA treatment (X2(3) = 12.839,
P = 0.005). Conversely, in the female urine sniffing
test, stressed mice spent less time interacting with the
cotton bulb containing the urine of a female mouse in
oestrus stage (Fig. 4A), which was not present when
mice additionally received SCFAs (X2(3) = 12.785,
P = 0.005). We subsequently pursued potentially under-
lying mechanisms by investigating the expression of
genes associated with reward-signalling in the striatum,
part of the mesolimbic reward pathway (Fig. 4B).
SCFA treatment increased dopamine receptor D1a
expression (DRD1a) independent of psychosocial stress
(F(1,36) = 13.416, P = 0.024), whereas dopamine receptor
D2 (DRD2) gene expression remained unaffected. As
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been
shown to essential for dopaminergic signalling during
psychosocial stress (Berton et al. 2006), we subsequently
analysed the expression of BDNF (exon IV) and its
receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). Although

Social interaction with a CD1 mouse used in the social defeat procedure was assessed in the social interaction
test 1 day after the last stressor (A). Mice were additionally assessed for social preference (B) and recognition (C)
with a conspecific mouse in the three-chamber sociability test 1 week post stress. The social interaction test was
non-parametrically distributed and analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significant differences are depicted as:
∗P < 0.05; Control compared to Stress. In the three-chamber sociability test, differences between ‘object’ versus

revealed a potentiated increase in body temperature
after an acute stressor in psychosocially stressed mice
(Fig. 6A), which was restored by SCFAs (X2(3) = 8.676,
P
=
0.034).
Additionally,
SCFAs
ameliorated
the
stress-induced corticosterone potentiation after an acute
stressor observed in the psychosocially stressed group
(X2(3) = 11.058, P = 0.011) (Fig. 6B and C). To
further understand how SCFAs affect HPA-axis reactivity,
we investigated the expression of hypothalamic genes
involved in stress signalling (Fig. 6D). SCFAs induced a
trend towards decreased corticotrophin-releasing factor
(CRF) expression (P = 0.122), which was significantly
upregulated by psychosocial stress (X2(3) = 9.530,
P
=
0.023).
In
addition,
SCFAs
downregulated
mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) expression, which was
reversed by stress (X2(3) = 14.805, P = 0.002).
Finally, no differences were found in glucocorticoid
receptor (GR) expression. As glucocorticoid signalling
in the hippocampus has previously been shown to
affect behaviour (Kim et al. 2015), we investigated
the gene expression of various glucocorticoid receptors
in the hippocampus (Fig. 6E). SCFAs induced a
trend towards decreased corticotrophin-releasing factor
receptor 1 (CRFR1) expression, which was upregulated
when mice also underwent stress (X2(3) = 7.426,
P = 0.059). In accordance with the hypothalamic gene
expression analysis, SCFAs downregulated MR expression,
whereas stress increased MR expression (X2(3) = 19.185,
P < 0.001). Finally, no differences were found in
hippocampal GR expression.
Intestinal permeability
In the intestinal permeability test, we found increased
levels of plasma FITC-dextran in psychosocially stressed
mice (Fig. 7A), which wasn’t present when mice were also
supplemented with SCFAs (X2(3) = 10.024, P = 0.018).

Cue- and context-associative learning induced by foot shock was evaluated using fear conditioning 4 weeks post

learning was assessed by measuring freezing behaviour in between tones (A), whereas cue-associative learning
was determined during the presentation of the tone (D). At phase 2 (retention), mice underwent the same protocol
without the shocks to assess context- and cue-associative retention (B and E, respectively). At phase 3 (extinction),
mice were assessed for context- and cue-associative extinction (C and F, respectively). All data are expressed as

intestinal bacterial product lipopolysaccharide, didn’t
reveal any difference between groups (Table 3). As
intestinal permeability is largely dependent on proper
functioning of tight junctions (Zihni et al. 2016), we
investigated gene expression of tight junction proteins in
the colon (Fig. 7B). Here we found increased expression
of claudin-1 (Cldn1) and tight junction protein 1 (Tjp1)
in stressed mice, which was ameliorated by SCFAs
(X2(3) = 15.311, P = 0.002 and X2(3) = 10.927,
P = 0.012, respectively). No significant differences were
found in occludin (Ocln) expression. We further hypo-
thesised that mucus layer thickness could explain some
of the observed findings, as this layer is impermeable
to luminal bacteria (Johansson et al. 2011). And similar
to the observed plasma LBP levels, no changes were
found in mucin 2 (Muc2) expression, the primary marker
for colonic mucus thickness. Finally, as stress signalling
has been shown to induce intestinal permeability
(Rodino-Janeiro et al. 2015), we investigated colonic gene
expression markers involved in glucocorticoid signalling
(Fig. 7C). Similar to the hippocampus, SCFAs decreased
the expression of CRFR1, which was upregulated by
stress (X2(3) = 11.003, P = 0.012). And surprisingly,
both stress and SCFAs decreased CRFR2 expression
(X2(3) = 10.280, P = 0.016). Stress also increased
MR expression, whereas SCFA administration resulted
in a downregulation (X2(3) = 20.076, P < 0.001). No
differences were found in GR expression.
Somatic pain response
Mice were assessed for their response to a noxious thermal
stimulus using the hot plate test 4 weeks post stress
(Table2).Animalsthatpreviouslyunderwentpsychosocial
stress showed a slight, but significant, increase in somatic
response (F(1,36) = 4.677, P = 0.038) as measured by the
time until mice licked their front paw. Further post hoc
tests did not reveal any differences between groups.
Body weight change
We sought to further understand the underlying causes of
the behavioural phenotypes seen in the previous analyses.
Considering that chronic psychosocial stress has pre-
viously been shown to affect host metabolism and body
weight (Finger et al. 2011; Tramullas et al. 2012), and

Figure 6. Psychosocial stress induces increased responsiveness to acute stress, which was ameliorated
by SCFAs
Stress responsiveness and HPA-axis reactivity were assessed using the stress-induced hyperthermia test 3 weeks
after psychosocial stress (A), and by assessing the corticosterone levels in response to acute stress 6 weeks
after psychosocial stress (B and C). The stressor used for the latter was the forced swim test. Hypothalamic
genes involved in HPA-axis signalling of which expression was investigated were corticotrophin-releasing factor
(CRF), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (D). For the hippocampus, these were
corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1), MR and GR (E). All data were non-parametrically distributed
and analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Mann-Whitney test. Significant differences are depicted
as: ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 and ∗∗∗P < 0.001; Control/Control compared to SCFA/Control or Control/Stress,
$P < 0.05, $$P < 0.01; SCFA/Control compared to SCFA/Stress, #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01; Control/Stress

SCFAs alleviate stress-induced brain–gut axis alterations
4935
the crucial role of gut microbial-derived SCFAs in host
energy metabolism (Byrne et al. 2015), we hypothesized
that SCFAs might ameliorate stress-induced alterations in
body weight, which was monitored throughout the study
(Table 3). Interestingly, psychosocial stress significantly
decreased body weight in the first 2 weeks of stress (day
3; X2(3) = 13.601, P = 0.004, to day 9; X2(3) = 8.854,
P = 0.031). This decrease in body weight subsequently
reversed, and a significant increase in body weight was
observed in week 3 (day 16; X2(3) = 22.537, P < 0.001).
The increase in body weight persisted throughout the rest
study (6 weeks post stress; X2(3) = 14.991, P = 0.002),
even though the effect size seemed to lessen over time
and no significant differences were found at the end-
point of the study. In accordance with this, no differences
were observed in organ measurements like the thymus,
adrenal, spleen and caecum weight, as well as colon
length (Table 3) Overall, SCFA treatment did not affect
any stress-induced changes in body weight, nor organ
weights.

Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) was quantified from plasma obtained at the end of the experiment from trunk blood.
Body weights and drinking water consumed were assessed throughout the study and normalised to the starting body weight to
calculate body weight change (� body weight). Organs were collected at the end of the study and weighted. Thymus, adrenals,
spleen and caecum weights were normalised to body weight, whereas the colon is expressed in total colon length. Faecal pellets were
collected 6 weeks post psychosocial stress and analysed for SCFA and BCFA levels. Colonic gene expression analysis for SCFA GPCRs
was carried out for free fatty acid receptors 2 and 3 (FFAR2 and FFAR3, respectively). Body weight data and gene expression data
were non-parametrically distributed and analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Mann-Whitney test. Data from SCFA
levels were normally distributed and analysed using a two-way ANOVA, followed by an LSD post hoc test. Significant differences are
depicted as: ∗P < 0.05 and ∗∗P < 0.01; Control/Control compared to Control/Stress, $P < 0.05 and $$P < 0.01; SCFA/Control compared
to SCFA/Stress. Data are expressed as means ± SEM (n = 8–10).
Short-chain fatty acid levels and GPCR signalling
As an increased body weight is associated with elevated
SCFA levels (Turnbaugh et al. 2006; Schwiertz et al. 2010;
Fernandes et al. 2014; Rahat-Rozenbloom et al. 2014), we
investigated whether stress affected faecal SCFA level as
well as body weight (Table 3). Stress increased total SCFAs
(F(1,37) = 9.946, P = 0.003), which was probably due
to an increase in acetate (F(1,37) = 9.470, P = 0.004),
but not propionate, butyrate and valerate levels, all of
which were unaffected by SCFA administration. Notable,
branched-chain fatty acids also remained unaffected. An
increased body weight, as seen in high-fat-diet-induced
obese mice, has been shown to result in an elevated
colonic gene expression of the SCFA GPCRs free fatty acid
receptors 2 and 3 (FFAR2 and FFAR3, respectively) (Lu
et al. 2016), indicating increased SCFA signalling. Similar
to the faecal SCFA levels, stress increased the expression
of FFAR2 (X2(3) = 11.610, P = 0.009), whereas FFAR3
was only significantly upregulated in mice receiving both
stress and SCFAs (X2(3) = 7.986, P = 0.046) (Table 3).
Gut microbiota composition
16S sequencing revealed no apparent changes in caecal
bacterial species diversity between groups (Fig. 8A). In
addition, principal coordinate analysis did not show any

clear separation of microbiota composition (Fig. 8B).
Stress, as well as SCFA treatment, did induce some minor
changes in caecal microbiota composition at the family
and genus level (Fig. 9A and B). Most of the differences
in microbiota composition detected were induced by the
combination of SCFAs and stress (Fig. 9C).
Discussion
Microbial metabolites are receiving increased attention
for their ability to modify brain and behaviour (Shultz
et al. 2015; Sampson et al. 2016; Gronier et al. 2018).
In the present study, we found that psychosocial stress
affected reward-seeking behaviour and increased both
stress-responsivity and in vivo intestinal permeability,
all of which were ameliorated by SCFA treatment.
SCFA supplementation also induced a decrease in
anxiety-like behaviour in the open field test and decreased
depressive-like behaviour in the forced swim test, both of
which were absent following stress. Similarly, we found
that the SCFA group showed decreased gene expression
of receptors involved with stress-signalling in the hypo-
thalamus, hippocampus and colon.
The goal of these experiments was to characterise
the enduring effects of chronic psychosocial stress on
behavioural, physiological and microbiome parameters
in the mouse and to assess if supplementation with
SCFAs could counter such effects. In line with pre-
vious reports using a continuous stress exposure model,
we report psychosocial stress-induced anhedonia in the
female urine sniffing test, increased stress-responsiveness
and increased in in vivo intestinal permeability (Burokas
et al. 2017). Interestingly, the previously reported effects of
chronic stress on cognition, anxiety- and depressive-like
behaviour, as well as alterations in gut microbiota
composition, failed to endure in our model (Burokas et al.
2017). Indeed, it is well known that many stress-induced
physiological and behavioural deficits dissipate over time
(Fanous et al. 2010; Ver Hoeve et al. 2013; Wohleb et al.
2014). For instance, 24 days after the last psychosocial
stressor, monocyte infiltration into the brain, micro-
glia inflammation and anxiety-like behaviour revert back
to baseline (Wohleb et al. 2014). In particular, micro-
glia inflammation has been implicated in cognition,
depression- and anxiety-like behaviour (Wohleb &
Delpech, 2016), which probably explains the absence of
differences in these behaviours. The absence of long-term
stress-induced differences gut microbiota might also be
explained by dissipation, suggesting that the caecal micro-
biota composition does not contribute to the enduring
effects of psychosocial stress, even though more research
investigating the microbiota at different time points post
stress, as well as gut microbiota-derived metabolites, is
warranted to validate this hypothesis.

SCFAs alleviate stress-induced brain–gut axis alterations
4939
Stress induced a long-term increase in body weight,
which is in line with the fact that stress exposure can
lead to overeating and excessive body weight (Finger et al.
2012; Vancampfort et al. 2015; Razzoli & Bartolomucci,
2016; Razzoli et al. 2017). Stress also increased faecal
acetate and total SCFA levels, as well as colonic FFAR2 and
FFAR3 gene expression. This is perhaps not surprising,
as increased body weight in obesity is associated with
increased SCFA levels (Turnbaugh et al. 2006; Schwiertz
et al. 2010; Fernandes et al. 2014; Rahat-Rozenbloom
et al. 2014), as well as increased colonic FFAR2 and
FFAR3 gene expression (Lu et al. 2016). Surprisingly, oral
SCFA supplementation did not ameliorate stress-induced
changes in body weight and SCFA levels, even though
SCFA supplementation has previously been shown to
reduce body weight in rodent models of obesity (Lin
et al. 2012; Vinolo et al. 2012; Lu et al. 2016). Inter-
estingly, the discrepancy between the fact that obesity is
generally associated with increased SCFA levels, whereas
SCFA supplementation ameliorates symptoms of obesity,
has been left unexplained (Byrne et al. 2015; van de Wouw
et al. 2017). As such, our data demonstrated a novel
interaction between chronic stress, host metabolism and
SCFAs, even though more research into the mechanisms
involved is warranted in order to understand the exact
role of chronic stress in SCFA–host metabolism inter-
actions. Finally, oral SCFA administration itself did not
affect faecal SCFA levels, which is probably explained by
the rapid uptake of SCFAs (Pouteau et al. 2003; van der
Beek et al. 2015).
We found that stress induced anhedonia in the female
urine sniffing test, which was not present in combination
with SCFA supplementation. However, the increased
sucrosepreferenceobservedfollowingstressisatoddswith
studiesshowingthatchronicstressreducesreward-seeking
behaviour in the sucrose preference test (Iniguez et al.
2014; Veeraiah et al. 2014), even though this is not
consistently reported (Van Bokhoven et al. 2011; O’Leary
et al. 2014). This may be explained by the fact that it
is a stress-withdrawal-induced effect we are modelling.
Together, these data support the concept of SCFAs
affecting reward-processes. In this regard, a human brain
imaging study showed that colonic propionate reduces
anticipatory reward responses to high-energy foods in
the human striatum (Byrne et al. 2016). Such findings
indicate that gut microbial-derived SCFAs could provide
target neural circuits underpinning hedonic food intake,
inadditiontobeingimplicatedintheregulationofhomeo-
static food intake (van de Wouw et al. 2017).
As previously reported, psychosocial stress induced
long-term
increased
responsiveness
to
acute
stress
challenges (Ver Hoeve et al. 2013). Here, we show that
acute stress-induced hyperthermia and corticosterone
levels in chronically stressed mice are ameliorated by SCFA
supplementation. Similar changes were found in colonic
MR gene expression, even though the stress-induced
increased gene expression in hippocampal MR remained
unaffected. In addition, no differences in GR gene
expression were found in any of the investigated tissues
which, similar to the absence of chronic stress-induced
anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour and impaired
cognition, could have dissipated over time. A more
robust effect was observed in the group solely receiving
SCFA administration, where there was a consistent
decrease in CRFR1, CRFR2 and MR gene expression
across all investigated tissues. Overall, these results
reveal that SCFAs can downregulate stress-signalling
and HPA-axis responsiveness, a crucial pathway in
microbiota–gut–brain axis communication (Wiley et al.
2017). The sympathetic nervous system could play a key
role in the mechanisms involved, as FFAR2 is expressed
on autonomic and somatic sensory ganglia and activation
hereof results in sympathetic nervous system activation
(Kimura et al. 2011; Nohr et al. 2015), even though
more research is warranted to validate this hypothesis.
This has particular implications in pathophysiology of
chronic anxiety disorders (e.g. PTSD), where a recurrent
stressor after the long-term cessation of chronic stress
rapidly results in behavioural and neuroinflammatory
sequelaesimilartotheonesobservedimmediatelyafterthe
cessation of chronic stress (McKim et al. 2016), indicating
that SCFA-targeted therapies might be a suitable dietary
target for such disorders.
Psychosocial stress induced an enduring increase in in
vivo intestinal permeability 5 weeks after the last stressor,
indicating long-term stress-induced changes in gastro-
intestinal barrier function. This was reversed by SCFA
treatment, which is not surprising as SCFAs have pre-
viously been shown to restore intestinal permeability
(Kelly et al. 2015; Tong et al. 2016; Simeoli et al.
2017). Surprisingly, stress induced an increased gene
expression of tight junction proteins Cldn1 and Tjp1,
even though increased intestinal permeability doesn’t
necessarily correlate to decreased tight junction gene
expression (Golubeva et al. 2017). In addition, no
differences were seen in plasma LBP levels, an indirect
marker of systemic exposure to the intestinal bacterial
product lipopolysaccharide. This might be attributable
to the fact that Muc2 gene expression remained
unaffected, indicating that the mucus barrier was still
functional and impermeable to bacteria (Johansson
et al. 2011). It is also important to note that gene
expression does not necessarily correlate with protein
levels. Another explanation for the discrepancy between
in vivo intestinal permeability and LBP levels could
be handling stress induced by the administration of
FITC-Dextran in the in vivo intestinal permeability test,
as stress-responsiveness was increased in the stress group,
and as stress signalling has been shown to induce intestinal
permeability (Rodino-Janeiro et al. 2015). These findings

have particular relevance for chronic stress-induced
gastrointestinal dysfunction, as chronic stress has pre-
viously been shown to promote colitis in mice (Gao
et al. 2018), and chronic stress is associated with an
increased risk of functional gastrointestinal disorders
in humans, as well as increased rates of relapse and
surgery for inflammatory bowel diseases (Stam et al. 1997;
Klooker et al. 2009; Bernstein, 2017). It must be noted
though that heightened right colonic fermentation has
been shown to be a potential pathophysiological factor in
irritablebowelsyndrome(Farmeretal.2014;Ringel-Kulka
et al. 2015).
Interestingly, although SCFAs decreased anxiety-like
behaviour in the open field test and depressive-like
behaviour in the forced swim test in control mice, the
presence of a stressful history prevented such effects from
being manifested. In a similar vein, we have shown that
dietary manipulations with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids, which alter the composition of the gut micro-
biota (Pusceddu et al. 2015a), have behavioural effects
in control, but not early-life stressed animals (Pusceddu
et al. 2015b).
It is important to note that SCFAs were administered as
a sodium salts and controls were sodium matched, which
could result in yet unstudied changes in behaviour and
physiology. This could have contributed to the unexpected
findings in the sucrose preference test, even though it is
important to note that drinking water consumption was
the same between groups. As such, it has to be pointed
out that a recent study showed that a high salt diet
increases the susceptibility to colitis and alters gut micro-
biota composition (Miranda et al. 2018).
Taken together, these results present novel insights
into how the gut microbial-derived metabolites SCFAs
influences brain homeostasis and behaviour, as well
as host metabolism. Finally, as SCFAs are one of the
main products of bacterial fermentation of dietary
fibres, this study supports the importance of potential
novel nutrition-based therapeutic targets for stress-related
disorders.
