 Abstract
 Due to observed interactions between Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandusplatyrliynchus)
 and polar bears (Ursus maritimus) during field work on Edge0ya, Svalbard, we measured
 response distances for reindeer from a stalking polar bear and improvised five approaches
 from a person disguised as a polar bear for comparison with human encounters. The alert,
 flight initiation and escape distances were 1.6, 2.5 and 2.3 times longer, respectively,
 when Svalbard reindeer were encountered by a person disguised as a polar bear compared
 to a person in dark hiking gear. Population increase of polar bears on Svalbard and decrease
 in sea-ice cover in the Arctic region during summer probably results in more frequent
 interactions with reindeer on the archipelago. Similar reindeer response behavior from
 encounters with a polar bear and persons disguised as polar bears indicate a predator-prey
 relationship between the two species on Edge0ya.

 Introduction
 The insular Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platy
 rhynchus Vrolik, 1829) maintain the northernmost populations of
 Rangifer, inhabiting an environment without large grazing com
 petitors and parasitizing insects. Besides rare polar bear (Ursus
 maritimus Phipps, 1774) predator incidences (Derocher et al.,
 2000) and few killings of newborn calves by Arctic fox (Alopex
 lagopus) (Tyler, 1986), Rangifer predators like wolf (Canis
 lupus), wolverine (Gulo gulo), lynx (Lynx lynx), brown bear
 (Ursus arctos), or golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) are absent
 from the Svalbard reindeer's natural habitat. This situation has
 prevailed for at least 4000 years (Van der Rnaap, 1986; Tyler
 and 0ritsland, 1989). Contrary to Rangifer subspecies elsewhere
 and probably as an adaptation to the absence of predators, Svalb
 ard reindeer live individually or in small groups (Alendal and
 Byrkjedal, 1976; Alendal et al., 1979), are seasonally sedentary
 (Tyler and 0ritsland, 1989), and do not have the nomadic behavior
 known from other Rangifer subspecies. Gregariousness is com
 monly recognized as a way to escape prédation and in the presence
 of predators, Rangifer subspecies in southern Norway, Russia,
 and North America group together, frequently counting several
 thousand individuals (e.g. Bergerud, 1974; Skogland, 1989; Syro
 echkovskii, 1995).
 In a comparative study of vigilance and fright behavior of
 wild reindeer in southern Norway (Reimers et al., 2012) and
 Svalbard (Reimers et al., 2011), we found Svalbard reindeer to
 be less vigilant than mainland wild reindeer, but the differences
 were surprisingly small. Several studies have documented effects
 of relaxed selection on antipredator behavior in mammals, but at
 present show no consistency regarding the speed at which prey
 discriminative abilities are lost (Caro, 2005). For example, Byers
 (1997) noted that antipredator behavior in pronghorns (Antiloca
 pra americana), apparently designed to evade capture by extinct

 predators, has persisted since the last ice age. In contrast, Berger
 (1998) uncovered a rapid reduction in predator recognition abili
 ties in North American ungulates isolated from predators for just
 tens of years. Despite the poor recognition skills of predator-naive
 prey, wild animals learn about predators rapidly. Although moose
 (Alces alces) that had been unfamiliar with dangerous predators
 for as few as 50 to 130 years were highly vulnerable to initial
 encounters, behavioral adjustment to reduce prédation transpired
 within a single generation (Berger et al., 2001).
 Last week of our field work on Edge0ya, Svalbard in luly/
 August 2006 (Reimers et al., 2011, 2012), we witnessed a polar
 bear stalk a group of four reindeer in our study area on Edge0ya
 (Fig. 1). Earlier, we had observed polar bears on 5 occasions and
 recorded fresh polar bear tracks on Grunnlinjesletta, along the
 river Plura and in the inner part of the valley Plurdalen ca. 13 km
 from the coastline. In the evening of 4 August, a group of 9
 reindeer (2 males, 5 females, and 2 calves) were observed grazing
 in a small side valley in the inner part of Plurdalen. Two days
 later, a polar bear was lying on the same grazing spot and reindeer
 were absent from the area. At this time, we had 50 recordings of
 reindeer responses towards persons approaching them and de
 cided to improvise and disguised a person in white clothing, in
 cluding a white mask, to simulate polar bear approaches, hereafter
 designated "polar bear" or "polar bear disguise" (Fig. 2). Since
 reindeer on Edge0ya have been protected from human hunting
 since 1925, we assumed that the reindeer would display stronger
 behavioral responses from encounters with polar bears compared
 to humans. If so, we would expect longer response distances when
 reindeer were approached by a human disguised as a polar bear
 compared to when reindeer were approached by human dressed
 in dark clothing.

 wide valleys, plateaus, and coastal plains. In the summer
 (June-September), reindeer are found in the valleys, coastal plains,
 and to some extent on the plateaus. Strict environmental regulations
 prevent tourist activities on the island and hence counteract habi
 tuation of reindeer to humans as reported elsewhere in Svalbard
 (Adventdalen) (Reimers et al., 2011). The present total reindeer
 summer population in Edge0ya is unknown, but was estimated at
 1730 ± 451 (SD) for the period 1969-1996 (0ritsland, 1998). The
 study area was surveyed, and the number of reindeer was estimated
 at 181 animals in 2006, down from 227 animals in 1976 (Reimers,
 2012).
 After the international harvest ban in 1973, the population
 of polar bears in the Svalbard archipelago has increased and was
 estimated at approximately 2650 animals, half of which probably
 reproduce in the Svalbard area (Aars et al., 2009). Edge0ya is an
 important polar bear denning area (Larsen, 1985).

 Material and Methods
 FRIGHT AND FLIGHT RESPONSES
 Flight initiation distance is the distance at which an animal
 begins to flee from an approaching predator (Ydenberg and Dill,
 1986). Because it is relatively simple to systematically approach
 animals until they flee, it is an excellent metric with which to
 quantify an individual's fearfulness in various circumstances and
 is extensively used (Tarlow and Blumstein, 2007).
 Behavioral responses were collected in Plurdalen, Grunnlinj
 esletta, Siegelfjellet and Burmeisterfjellet (Fig. 1) under snow-free
 conditions, during "daylight hours" between 0900 and 2400 in
 July and August 2006 by a single observer on foot. During 67
 encounters, the observer dressed in dark hiking clothing and in 5
 encounters in a "polar bear disguise" and moving in a forward
 leaning amble posture (Fig. 2). The observer measured response
 distances between the reindeer and the approacher and the resultant

 displacement distance by the reindeer after taking flight. All re
 sponse distances were measured with laser monoculars (Leica
 Rangemaster 1200 Scan; 1 m accuracy at 1000-1200 m).
 We used wildlife response distance terminology and method
 ology recommended by Taylor and Knight (2003) modified for our
 study by Reimers et al. (2011):
 (1) Start distance: the distance between the approacher and
 the individual reindeer (or the closest animal if we encountered a
 group) before the start of a disturbance.
 (2) Sight distance: the distance between the approacher and
 the closest animal when animals in the group displayed an alerted
 behavior directed at the approacher.
 (3) Alert distance: the distance when the reindeer exhibited
 an increased alert response by grouping together or individuals
 urinating with one hind leg extended outward at an exaggerated
 angle, while staring at the approacher.
 (4) Flight initiation distance: the distance from the approacher
 to the reindeer when the reindeer initially took flight.
 (5) Escape distance: the shortest straight-line distance from
 where the reindeer took flight in response to the approacher to
 where the reindeer resumed grazing or bedded down.
 Upon location of individuals or groups, 6 parameters were
 recorded: group size; group composition (mixed, yearlings and
 older of both sexes; males, yearlings and older; female(s) with calf
 at foot); dominant activity of the group when first sighted (lying
 or grazing); wind direction relative to the observer (tail wind or
 into the wind including crossways to the wind); topography of the
 surrounding area (level or rugged) and direction of the encounter
 (downhill, flat, or uphill).
 The approacher measured the start distance and used a direct
 approach method (Reimers et al., 2011): advancing directly towards
 the animal or estimated center of the group at a constant speed (~
 4 km h"1) with three stops (s6 s) to measure the additional response
 distances (sight, alert, and flight initiation). The observer continued
 to approach the animal(s) on all occasions until reaching the posi
 tion where the reindeer were located at the start of the disturbance
 for measurement of the escape distance from this point. All mea
 surements were made from the position of the approacher to the
 closest animal in a group.
 STATISTICAL METHODS
 Reindeer were probably repeatedly approached during the
 field period but not on the same day, except the day when a group
 of 4 reindeer were approached first by a polar bear and again later
 by a person in "polar bear disguise."
 Start, sight, alert, flight initiation, and escape distances were
 analyzed with linear models (LM) using statistical software R
 (http://www.r-project.org). Due to strongly imbalanced data, we
 reduced the encounters made by a person (N = 67) to include only
 mixed groups and individuals or groups of either females or males
 (N = 56), excluding females with calves at foot. Next, we included
 only fixed effects that were the same as when we approached in
 disguise (grazing animals, level terrain, head wind, and downhill
 or level encounters; N = 11). The model fixed effects included
 approacher (person or "polar bear"), start distance in the sight
 model, and sight distance in the alert and flight initiation models
 (both centered at their means) (Table 1). To facilitate interpretation
 of the disturber on the four vigilance measures, we present pre
 dicted response values for encounters by person and "polar bear"
 (Fig. 3), which also show response distances in the total sample
 excluding females with calves (/V = 56).
 As a measure of effect size for the different treatments (per
 sons vs. "polar bears"), we calculated d-scores (Cohen's effect
 size) for the different distances, subtracting the mean of the control
 group (person) from the mean of the experimental group ("polar
 bear") and dividing by the pooled standard deviation (Cohen,
 1988).
 Results
 A person dressed in dark hiking gear approached individuals
 or small groups of reindeer (sll; median = 2) 11 times, and was
 disguised as a "polar bear" 5 times during July and August 2006
 (Appendix Table Al). The response distances for alert, flight initia
 tion, and escape were 1.6 (2.0), 2.5 (3.2), and 2.3 (4.0) times longer,
 respectively, when Svalbard reindeer were approached by a person
 in "polar bear disguise" compared to a person in dark hiking gear.
 (Numbers in parentheses relate to person sample size [N = 56]).
 Start distance was longer (673 vs. 374 m [median 480 vs. 393
 m]) when reindeer were approached by a ' 'polar bear' ' compared
 to a person in dark hiking clothing (Table 1). Start distance did
 not influence sight distance, which did not differ between the two

 appear to be longer when reindeer were approached by a "polar

 relates to small "polar bear" sample size.

 201 m) and 92 m (95% CI: 44 to 140 m), respectively, when ap
 proached by a person (Fig. 3, Table 1).
 Escape distance was 366 m (95% CI: 244 to 488 m) when
 approached by the "polar bear" and 156 m (95% CI: 8 to 304 m)
 by a person. The farthest distance for an escape response was 455
 m (median = 358 m) when approached by a "polar bear" and
 460 m (median = 105 m) by a person.
 A d-score as a measure of effect size for the different treat
 ments (persons vs. "polar bears) were: start: 1.22, sight: 0.56, alert:
 1.29, flight initiation: 1.76 and escape distance: 1.26, which trans
 lates into a median effect for sight distance and a large effect for
 the other distances (Ellis, 2010).
 On one occasion, we observed a polar bear approaching a
 group of 4 reindeer into the wind from a start position of ca. 1500
 m. The reindeer discovered the bear at approximately 400 m, be
 came alert and initiated running/flight simultaneously at ca. 300
 m. They slowed down after ca. 350 m and watched the bear at a
 closest distance of approximately 250 m (equaling an escape dis
 tance of ca. 350 m) as the bear had changed direction towards
 another small group of grazing reindeer. This second group was
 approached as the polar bear made use of ridges and narrow depres
 sions, apparently undetected by the reindeer. At a point where no
 further hidden approach was possible, the bear laid down head
 pointing towards the animals. It remained there when we retreated
 to base camp after approximately one hour. The bear did not change
 its slow moving speed during the two approaches.

  person in dark hiking gear. It is reasonable to assume that contrast
 ing white color facilitated a longer sight distance than when ap
 proaching in dark gear, which is further enhanced in the larger
 sample (N = 56) and less so in the small sample (N = 11). Apart
 from sight distance, the two samples (N = 11 and N = 56) did
 not predict the response distances differently although the larger
 sample tended to give somewhat shorter response distances (Fig.
 3). As sight distance was correlated to neither flight initiation nor
 escape distance (Reimers et al., 2011), it is unlikely that visibility
 (white color vs. dark clothing) in itself should cause the longer
 fright and flight responses for the "polar bear" encounters unless
 the reindeer associated the appearance of the approaching white
 object with a threat, i.e. a predator. Even if our sample size is small,
 our results support an experience-dependant escape response that
 is adjusted to the level of potential prédation risk, and not a re
 sponse to a difference in visibility of the approaching object.
 The way in which a population's anti-predator behavior is
 modified depends on its underlying developmental mechanisms
 in terms of both heritable predisposition (Riechert and Hedrick,
 1990) as well as experience (Berger et al., 2001 ; Blumstein, 2004).
 Deecke et al (2002) found that harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are
 capable of complex discrimination of different stimuli and that
 they may modify their predator image by selectively habituating
 only to harmless stimuli. They concluded that fear in seals is fo
 cused on local threats by learning and experience. The predator
 recognition may be olfactory, acoustic, and visual (Blumstein et
 al., 2000; Deecke et al., 2002; Webb et al., 2010; Kappel et al.,
 2011). Since there were no olfactory or acoustic stimuli in our
 study (head wind and no noise from the observer apart from normal
 walking noise during all approaches), predator recognition must
 have been associated with the visual image of the encountering
 object. Deecke et al (2002) observations are relevant in this con
 text. They found that seals responded strongly towards both meat
 eating killer whales and unfamiliar fish-eating killer whales, but
 not to local familiar fish-eating killer whales.
 Although one observation of a polar bear approach (N = 1)
 provides little supporting evidence, it does not contradict the
 ' 'polar bear disguise" response distances. This one encounter indi
 cates that Svalbard reindeer indeed perceive polar bears as a preda
 tor. This is supported by Derocher et al. (2000) who in 1983-1999
 (March-April) collected observations of seven prédation events
 and six instances of scavenging of Svalbard reindeer by polar
 bears. Furthermore, in two recent newspaper articles, Hovelsrud
 (2009) and Sandal (2008) reported the killing of two reindeer males
 by polar bears in late spring (1991) and September (2008). Both
 males were apparently killed as a result of an ambush attack or a
 successful stalk. Also; Brook and Richardson (2002) reported that
 a polar bear was observed stalking and chasing caribou in western
 Hudson Bay in July. Even if these incidences are rare events, they
 show that polar bear may predate reindeer in all seasons, and thus
 lend support to a predator-prey relationship between the two
 species.
 Experience-dependant behavior may be lost after the first gen
 eration in the absence of predators, while more "hard-wired"
 antipredator behavior may persist for thousands of years following
 isolation from predators (Byers, 1997; Coss, 1999). On the other
 hand, experience-dependant behavior may be quickly restored the
 first time individuals encounter predators (Brown et al., 1997). In
 accordance with this, we found a 2.2 times higher vigilance rate
 displayed by reindeer in Edge0ya with a dense polar bear popula
 tion compared to reindeer in Nordenskiöld Land with fewer polar
 bears (Reimers et al., 2011 ). However, Svalbard reindeer maintain
 small group size (average and median 2.9 and 2 animals, respec
 tively) both on Edge0ya and in Nordenskiöld Land (Reimers et
 al. 2011). Maintenance of small group size is not expected if rein
 deer were exposed to strong prédation pressure (see review by
 Caro, 2005, Table 4.4).
 According to a recent summary report from the IUCN Polar
 Bear Specialist Group, there was likely an increase in the Barents
 Sea polar bear subpopulation from 1973 until recently (IUCN,
 2010). Also, the sea-ice cover in the arctic region during summer
 has decreased (Singarayer et al., 2006) and is expected to continue
 decreasing in the years to come (Zhang and Walsh, 2006). This
 has caused an increase, and will probably continue influencing an
 increase in the amount of time individual polar bears spend on land
 (Derocher et al., 2004; Schliebe et al., 2008; Gleason and Rode,
 2009). As a result, polar bears and reindeer are together for longer
 periods, a situation in which interactions between them could occur
 more frequently (Derocher et al., 2000). Nevertheless, we do not
 anticipate short-term effects on reindeer other than temporary and
 local changes in distribution and behavior (Reimers, 2012). The
 possibility for behavioral changes of both reindeer and polar bears
 in response to future increased interactions calls for a follow up
 study.
