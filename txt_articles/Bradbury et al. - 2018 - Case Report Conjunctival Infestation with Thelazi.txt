Abstract.
We report a case of thelaziasis in a 26-year-old female, acquired in Oregon. A total of 14 worms were
removed from the patient’s left eye and were morphologically identified as being Thelazia gulosa. Until now, only two
species of Thelazia have been implicated in causing human disease, Thelazia callipaeda in Asia and Europe and occa-
sional reports of Thelazia californiensis from the United States of America. Here, we describe a third, previously unreported
parasite of humans, T. gulosa (the cattle eyeworm) as an agent of human thelaziasis and the first reported case of human
thelaziasis in North America in over two decades.
INTRODUCTION
Thelaziasis is an ocular infection caused by nematodes of
Thelazia spp., usually transmitted by flies that feed on lacrimal
secretions. Although a common veterinary infection, human
infection is considered to be a rare zoonotic event. Cases of
human thelaziasis have been reported worldwide, pre-
dominantly in Europe andAsia.1 Cases occurpredominantly in
rural communities with close proximity to animals and poor
living standards. Thelaziasis mainly affects the elderly and
children, who may be less able to keep flies away from their
faces.2 Most of the reported cases have been caused by
Thelazia callipaeda, occurring in the old world, particularly in
Japan.1 Thelazia callipaeda has also rarely been reported
infecting humans in China, Japan, India, Burma, Korea, Tai-
wan, Thailand, Indonesia, Russia, Italy, and France.3 There
have been 10 previously reported cases of human thelaziasis
from the United States; nine from California and one in Utah, all
were reported as Thelazia californiensis.4,5 Other species of
Thelazia are reported as infecting animals in the United States,
these being, Thelazia gulosa, Thelazia lacrymalis, Thelazia
rhodesi, and Thelazia skrjabini.3
CASE REPORT
A 26-year-old avid outdoorswoman from Oregon reported
left eye irritation accompanied by the sensation of a foreign
object. The patient had, in previous weeks, been practicing
horsemanship in Gold Beach, OR, a region where cattle
farming occurs. The irritation worsened and on the eighth day
of symptoms, the patient removed a small, translucent worm.
She presented to a local physician who removed two addi-
tional worms. The worms were submitted to Northwest Pa-
thology for analysis and identification where they were fixed in
10% buffered formalin and forwarded to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) Parasitic Diseases Ref-
erence Laboratory for identification. The following day, the
patient presented to an optometrist where three additional
worms were removed. The patient was arranged to see an
infectious disease specialist who removed a partial worm,
which was also sent to the CDC. The patient was diagnosed
with parasitic infiltration of the left periocular tissues and a
secondary bilateral papillary reaction of the upper and lower
palpebral conjunctivae. The patient was advised to undergo
manual extraction rather than topical or systemic anti-
helminthic therapy. Despite multiple washouts by ophtalmo-
logists, no further worms were seen by providers; however,
the patient continued to remove worms from her left eye. A
total of14 worms wereremoved from the patient’s left eye over
20 days. Since this time, the patient has been without symp-
toms and no further worms have been observed.
METHODS
A whole adult worm submitted to the CDC Parasitic Dis-
eases Reference Laboratory Morphology Department was
morphologically examined. The worm was preserved in 10%
neutral buffered formalin, disallowing DNA extraction and
molecular analysis. The worm was independently examined
by microscopy by three experienced morphologists, followed
by collation of their opinions to make a final identification.
Further morphometric analysis was performed, in consultation
with all major morphological references,3,6–8 to confirm the
species identification.
Ethical approval. Publication of this case report was
granted institutional review board approval by the cdc center
for global health office of the associate director for science,
tracking number 2017-381.
RESULTS
The worms submitted to the CDC were female and had
acquired a degree of opacity in the formalin preservative
(Figure 1). Minor shrinkage had occurred in the formalin fixa-
tive, one worm measured 11-mm long by 320 μm at the widest
point. The anterior sharply tapered toward a deep, cup-
shaped buccal cavity (width 35 μm, depth 25 μm). No lips were
observed at the buccal cavity. The prominent esophagus met
the intestinal junction 470 μm posterior to the anterior-most
portion of the cephalic region of the worm (the anterior
opening of the buccal cavity). The width of the widest point of
the esophageal bulb was 180 μm. Oval, thin-shelled, spirurid-
type eggs were observed within the ovaries. The vulva opened
20 μm anterior to the esophago-intestinal junction and 450 μm
from the anterior-most portion of the cephalic region of the

 worm. The pattern of the cuticle at the vulval opening was not
uniform and the vulval opening did not protrude. There were
approximately5.5distincttransversecuticularstriationsineach
10 μm of the cuticle at the widest point of the worm. These
striationswererounded rather thanserratedinappearance.The
width at the anal opening was 100 μm. There was no protrusion
of the anal opening, a unilateral postcloacal tapering and two
postanal papillae were observed on the bluntly rounded tail.
After analysis of the observed anatomical features and con-
sultation with references describing the morphology of species
of Thelazia reported from humans and animals,3,6–8 the worms
were identified as belonging to the species T. gulosa, a cattle
eyeworm. Several morphological features were used to differ-
entiate this isolate from other Thelazia spp., including the two
species previously recorded infecting humans, these are listed
in Table 1. Features differentiating this isolate from other spe-
cies found in North America and the two species previously
identified as infecting humans were the following: the distance
of the vulval opening from the anterior cephalic region that the
vulval opening had no distinct features and was at the same
level as the esophago-intestinal junction; possession of a deep
and cup-like buccal cavity, rounded, tightly spaced, and rela-
tively discrete cuticular ridges; a nonprotruding anus with uni-
lateral tapering postanally and the presence of two postanal
phasmids.
DISCUSSION
Thelazia gulosa: phylum Nematoda, order Spirurida, family
Thelaziidae, and genus Thelazia are parasites affecting the
conjunctiva of the definitive host, where they are ovoviparous.
In North America, T. gulosa is distributed throughout the
northern states of the United States and southern Canada.3,9
The intermediate host, Musca autumnalis (face flies) in-
gests L1 larvae passed in the definitive host lachrymal
secretions.3,10 These larvae develop within the abdomen of
the fly, then migrate to the hemocoel, where development to
L3 larva requires a minimum of 9 days at 27�C.11 The L3 larvae
migrate to the mouthparts and are inoculated into the con-
junctiva of a new host with feeding.3,10 The L3 larvae then de-
velopintotheadultstageintheconjunctivalsacandprebulbular
tear film. This patient’s outdoor pastimes of riding horses and
fishing during the summer months likely allowed exposure to
vector face flies, and she may have delayed brushing away of
these flies from her face. All recorded cases of human thela-
ziasis have been reported during the summer months.3
Thelazia gulosa is widely distributed throughout North
America and Europe, Central Asia, and Australia, where it is
commonly a parasite of cattle.3 The vector fly in North America,
M. autumnalis, was introduced from the Palearctic region
immediately after World War II and has spread across the
continent, including the state of Oregon, since that time.11
This fly also transmits another cattle eyeworm, T. skrjabini, in
North America.3 The prevalence of Thelazia spp. larva in face
flies captured in Massachusetts, Iowa, and Alberta during the
summer months varying between 1% and 37%, with an av-
erage of 2.5–4.2 larva per infected fly.11 Vector flies of
T. gulosa in other regions of the world include M. autumnalis,
Musca larvipara, and Musca osiris in Europe,12 Musca amica
in the Russian Far East, Musca vitripennis in Crimea, and
possibly also M. larvipara in Ukraine.9 Musca domestica has
been suggested as a vector, but this remains controversial.13

THELAZIA GULOSA THELAZIASIS IN THE USA
1173
 The most common clinical findings are mild conjunctival in-
flammation,foreignbodysensation,follicular hypertrophyof the
conjunctiva, and excessive lacrimation. Occasionally, the
worms migrate across the surface of the eye and cause corneal
scarring, opacity, and blindness.3 Because the localization of
Thelazia infestation is confined to the conjunctiva and removal
of worms with a cotton swab or forceps is sufficient. The clinical
signs usually resolve quickly after the removal of the parasites.3
Immediate postremoval irrigation with Lugol’s iodine or 2–3%
boric acid may be considered.3 Injection of 2 mL levamisole into
the conjunctival sac or administration of 5 mg/kg orally or par-
enterally has been used in the treatment of T. californiensis in-
fection3 before the availability of ivermectin. A subcutaneous
dose of 2.2 mg/kg of ivermectin has been used to cure human
infections in Asia and Europe.3
Previously, only two Thelazia spp. have been implicated
as causing human thelaziasis worldwide, these being
T. californiensis (in the western United States) and T. callipaeda
(in Europe and Asia).2,3 In this report, we add a third species,
T. gulosa, an endemic eyeworm of cattle in North America,
Europe, Central Asia, and Australia as a novel agent of human
thelaziasis in the United States of America.
