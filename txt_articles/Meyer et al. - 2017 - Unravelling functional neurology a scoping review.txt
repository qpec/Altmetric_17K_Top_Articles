in a context of chiropractic manual therapy

Abstract
Background: Functional Neurology (FN), a seemingly attractive treatment approach used by some chiropractors,
proposes to have an effect on a multitude of conditions but some of its concepts are controversial.
Objectives and design: A scoping review was performed to describe, in the context of chiropractic manual
therapy, 1) the FN theories, and 2) its clinical applications (i.e. its indications, examination procedures, treatment
modalities, treatment plans, and clinical outcomes) using four sources: i) one key textbook, ii) the scientific peer-
reviewed literature, iii) websites from chiropractors using FN, and iv) semi-structured interviews of chiropractors
using FN.
Methods: The scientific literature was searched in PubMed, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus, completed by a hand
search in the journal Functional Neurology, Rehabilitation and Ergonomics (November 2016 and March 2017,
respectively). The only textbook on the topic we found was included and articles were chosen if they had an
element of manual therapy. There was no restriction for study design but discussion papers were excluded.
Websites were found in Google using the search term “Functional Neurology”. Chiropractors, known to use FN,
were invited based on their geographical location. Theories were mainly uncovered in the textbook as were all
aspects of the clinical applications except treatment plans. The other three sources were used for the five aspects
of clinical applications. Results were summarized and reported extensively in tables.
Results: Eleven articles were included, five websites scrutinized, and four semi-structured interviews performed. FN
is based on the belief that reversible lesions in the nervous system are the cause of a multitude of conditions and
that specific clusters of neurons can be positively affected by manipulative therapy, but also by many other stimuli.
Diagnostic procedures include both conventional and unusual tests, with an interpretation specific to FN. Initial
treatment is intense and clinical outcomes reported as positive.
Conclusion: FN gives the impression to be a complex alternative to the old variant of the chiropractic subluxation
model, in which the vertebral subluxation is replaced by “physiological lesions” of the brain, and the treatment,
spinal adjustments, are complemented by various neurological stimuli. Both models purport to treat not the
symptoms but the cause. We conclude there is a need for more scientific documentation on the validity of FN.

 Background
Chiropractic is a health profession that is legally rec-
ognized
in
several
countries
under
a
regulatory
framework to deal with neuromusculoskeletal condi-
tions [1, 2]. Spinal manipulation is one of the key
aspects of chiropractic treatment, often combined
with advice on life-style, physical activities, specific
exercises, and ergonomics [3, 4]. Clinical experience
shows that manipulation of joints can have a pain-
reducing effect, and this has also been confirmed in
purely experimental studies [5], providing at least
some evidence for the approach.
However, some chiropractors propose therapeutic solu-
tions outside the recognized scope of chiropractic practice.
For as long as chiropractors have existed, some practi-
tioners have also treated non-musculoskeletal conditions
such as asthma, colic in children, and dysmenorrhea, al-
though this part of clinical practice has been less
common than the treatment for musculoskeletal con-
ditions [4, 6, 7]. The rationale for such treatment is
that spinal manipulation can have an effect also on
the autonomic nervous system [8].
There are several currents within chiropractic that pur-
port to successfully treat various non-musculoskeletal
conditions. One such approach is Functional Neurology
(FN), which, at first glance has as its rationale the concept
that disturbances of the physiology in the nervous system,
especially those in the brain, can have many detrimental
effects on the body. These disturbances are proposed to
be often reversible or at least to have the potential for
improvement. The list of conditions proposed to be
successfully treated by FN is extensive, the diagnostic
procedures complex and the therapeutic approach often
multi-facetted.
When attempting to review the origins of FN, the
earliest reference to FN found in the scientific litera-
ture is an article from 1997 by a chiropractor, also
presented as the founder of FN, FR Carrick [9]. In
this article, he stated that spinal manipulation can
alter the size of the physiological blind spot of the
eye in certain cases, a phenomenon that he claimed
was a proof that spinal manipulation has an effect on
brain function. In that article, there is also a lengthy
presentation of the presumed causative link between
spinal manipulation and brain function. This work
elicited several responses to the editor, with many
questions and criticisms [10–16], but also generated
positive comments [17–19].
Despite the criticism that FN has encountered over
the last 20 years, both inside and outside the profession
[10, 14–16, 20, 21], FN appears to have become an
attractive discipline for many chiropractors [3, 22],
promoted by some as a discipline at the cutting edge of
science [22, 23]. For example, a recent survey of the
Australian chiropractic workforce reports that 13.3% of
the respondents use FN [3]. Other health practitioners
(e.g. medical doctors, physiotherapists) also seem to be
interested in this new discipline, having access to FN
courses [24].
The main criticism leveled at FN concerns the lack
of scientific basis [10, 14–16, 20, 21]. In addition,
published information seems to be sparse and, for the
uninitiated, the subject is complex. An overview of
FN would therefore be of value to chiropractors, stu-
dents and chiropractic educators, with an interest in
FN to: 1) provide a basic description of its concepts
and their clinical applications and 2) to present the
scientific evidence underlying these basic concepts.
In this scoping review we will focus on the first point
by attempting to provide a basic description of FN con-
cepts and their clinical applications, in the context of
chiropractic manual therapy. Our six research objectives
were to describe: 1) the theories that constitute the basis
of FN, 2) the conditions that functional neurologists
treat, 3) the diagnostic procedures, 4) the therapeutic
modalities, 5) the course of care, and 6) the clinical out-
comes obtained or expected with this approach.
The field of FN is large, composed of different sub-
specialties [25], some of which have developed some-
what different directions than the original one. The
work of G Leisman and R Melillo in the area of FN
applied to childhood neurodevelopmental disorders is
an example of such sub-specialties [26]. Nevertheless,
it appears to be practiced primarily by chiropractors.
In fact, FN is also known as “Chiropractic Neur-
ology”. For these reasons, we have limited our review
of the literature to the fundamental concepts of FN
and/or
with
FN
as
a
supplement
to
“traditional”
chiropractic, i.e. which would typically include the use
of manual therapy.
Method
Design and brief description of study
In order to obtain information on our six research
objectives, we performed a scoping review using three
written sources and one semi-structured interview, as
briefly described below. Scoping reviews are often
used
to
obtain
a
preliminary
understanding
of
a
poorly understood topic, have a non-rigid but system-
atic approach, allow for multiple methods, and do not
necessitate a critical element [27, 28]. Although there
are currently no strict methodological rules for con-
ducting scoping reviews, we endeavored to follow the
six steps of the Arksey and O’Malley framework [27].
Initially, the first author read the only comprehen-
sive textbook on the concepts of FN that was found
[29]. We used this source as the basis or starting
point
for
our
future
work
in
order
to
gain
an

 understanding
of
the
FN
theoretical
background.
Thereafter, we consulted the scientific literature to
see what information was available and searched the
internet to obtain an idea of how practitioners, who
state that they practice FN, describe their activities.
Also, we interviewed a number of practitioners who
use FN in their daily practice, making it possible to
ask clarifying questions. To allow for ease of reading,
several aspects of the various methods have been de-
scribed in Additional files 1, 2 and 3.
Search strategy for information
Written information
Textbook We had access to a textbook [29] that served
as
our
first
source
of
information.
This
book,
recommended by organizations such as the American
Chiropractic
Neurology
Board
and
the
Functional
Neurology Society, is authored by a chiropractor, RW
Beck, with the foreword written by FR Carrick.
Scientific literature It was difficult to find scientific lit-
erature on FN using the usual search strategies, for which
reason alternative methods were employed. These have
been described in Additional file 1. Briefly, a search by
name
of
author
on
PubMed,
PsycINFO,
and
SPORTDiscus was conducted. This was complemented by
contacting by email a number of practitioners and/or re-
searchers known to be involved in FN to ask them for
their updated publication list. Following this step, we
searched for articles in the journal Functional Neurology,
Rehabilitation, and Ergonomics, which has FN among its
aims and scope. This journal was recommended by one of
the researchers involved in FN.
Websites The internet was searched via Google using the
keyword “Functional Neurology” in order to capture a
number of professional websites of chiropractors presenting
themselves as functional neurologists.
Interviews
Through our network of contacts, we identified European-
based chiropractors who used FN in their daily practice
and who were likely to participate in a future interview. A
convenience sample consisting of five of those, all living in
France, where also the chief investigator was located, were
finally invited. The four who replied were interviewed.
These four chiropractors were contacted by email, provided
with information about the survey and asked to provide
informed consent.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria of articles and websites
Scientific articles
Articles were included if they described studies on a
FN therapeutic approach to one or more specific
condition(s) or if they described studies on a FN
therapeutic approach on healthy or non-healthy sub-
jects with positive clinical sign(s). Also, the articles
had to include the use of manual therapy. Articles
written by functional neurologists dealing with issues
such as medication use or modified states of con-
sciousness were not included. Discussion papers, ab-
stracts, poster presentations, conference papers, and
letters to the editors were excluded.
Websites
Websites of chiropractors describing themselves as
functional neurologists were included if they clearly
mentioned that they were Diplomates of the Ameri-
can Chiropractic Neurology Board (DACNB), as this
seems to indicate that the person has obtained a cer-
tain level of proficiency on this topic. There were no
restriction criteria regarding their nationality or their
number of years of experience in FN. However, the
search was restricted to websites written in English.
Inclusion criteria for the interview
Our inclusion criteria were that the chiropractors were
DACNB or, at least, in active training. They also had to
be willing to clarify the basic concepts of FN and to
describe the applications of FN in their daily practice
during a semi-structured interview. We selected the four
French chiropractors for geographical reasons, as the
research team was located in Paris.
Collection of relevant information
Written information
Textbook The chapters of interest of the textbook were
selected based on its table of contents. The whole book
was read prior to this in order to attempt to gain a good
understanding of the topic.
Scientific articles The first investigator searched the da-
tabases and publication lists forwarded by the authors
on request (see Additional file 1) and selected the poten-
tially relevant full texts from titles and abstracts. As the
authors were not familiar with FN, the selection of po-
tentially relevant full texts was generous. ALM and CLY
independently made the search in the journal Functional
Neurology, Rehabilitation, and Ergonomics and selected
the potential relevant full texts from titles and abstracts.
All full texts were independently assessed in relation to
the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition, the first
Meyer et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2017) 25:19 
Page 3 of 23
 investigator searched reference lists for relevant articles
from the databases and the journal.
Websites Once the first author had found the men-
tion that the chiropractors were DACNB, the corre-
sponding websites were screened (except for their
blog section) sequentially, in the order by which they
appeared in a Google search conducted in September
2016. This was performed by searching for terms in
relation to FN and our research objectives. When no
new information was found for one topic, search was
stopped for this topic but continued for the others
until no new information was found. Texts were
documented with screenshots.
Interviews
There are no strict rules for how to conduct or interpret
interviews in scoping reviews. Relevant information was
collected through a semi-structured interview designed
by the first author and another PhD student. It was
tested on one of the chiropractors, after which some im-
provements were made, mainly to the wording of the
questions. The interview contained twenty-four ques-
tions, eleven were used in this review and the others will
be used elsewhere (see Additional file 1). Clarifying
questions were added as needed during the interviews.
The interview instrument was constructed based on our
specific questions related to FN and thus had not been
previously used, tested or validated.
Ethical considerations
According to French law [30, 31], no ethics permis-
sion is required when interviewing consenting adults
in a non-interventional context. However, the written
consent of each interviewed chiropractor concerning
the recording of the interview and its use as research
material was obtained. Furthermore, no personal in-
formation was collected and all results were reported
anonymously. The transcribed versions were provided
to the interviewees for comments.
Extraction of information
Written information
The information from the textbook by RW Beck [29] was
retrieved by the first author from specific chapters almost
entirely dedicated to our topics of interest. Chapters 1, 4
and 18 were used to extract the theories, which were com-
plemented by information from chapters 3, 9, 19 and 20.
Chapter 19 and, to a lesser extent chapter 20, were used to
extract the indications. Chapter 4 and, to a lesser extent
chapter 19, were used for examination procedures. Chapter
20 and, to a lesser extent chapter 19, were used for treat-
ment modalities. The information related to the outcomes
of treatment were extracted from chapter 19. Despite a
chapter dedicated to clinical cases, there was no detailed in-
formation on treatment plans. References in this text (sec-
tion “Neurophysiological theories”) refer directly to these
chapters and relevant pages to assist the reader who might
want to compare our information with that of the textbook.
Descriptive
checklists
were
created
to
collect
systematic information from the scientific articles and
from
the
websites,
in
relation
to
the
research
objectives (available in Additional file 2a and b). The
format
and
contents
were
somewhat
different,
depending
on
the
data
source.
For
example,
the
websites were expected to provide information on
expected
outcome
rather
than
reported
outcome
whereas the reverse was expected from the scientific
literature. The search for relevant information in the
scientific literature was done independently by two
authors (ALM and CLY). The descriptive checklist for
the websites was completed by the first author who
blindly
performed
this
procedure
twice
for
each
website.
Interviews
Each interview was taped and transcribed in a narrative
form and in a tabulated form to better visualize the infor-
mation (tabulated form is available in Additional file 2c).
They were conducted by the first author and another PhD
student, one of whom was responsible for the narrative
transcript of two of the interviews and the other for the
transcript of the remaining two. After agreement between
the two interviewers on the content of each narrative
transcription (tapes were available in case of disagree-
ment), the transcript was sent to the interviewed chiro-
practor to obtain his/her agreement on its content.
Absence of feedback was interpreted as an acceptance of
the text (the interviewees were informed of this). There-
after, based on each narrative transcript, the two inter-
viewers independently extracted and collated information
by themes in a table, which was created in relation to the
research objectives of the review. The content of their re-
spective tabulated transcript was compared for agreement
(final table is available in Additional file 2c).
Data analysis and synthesis
Initially, the first author identified which of the four
sources had dealt with the various research objectives
(see Table 1). Thereafter, we concentrated on one item
at a time, collecting the relevant information either in a
table or as narrative text. The multiple methods are
detailed in Additional file 3. A narrative synthesis was
done for each research objective, based mainly on the
tabulated overview of the information.

 Results
General information
Textbook
The textbook provided information for five of our objec-
tives (theories, indications, diagnostic procedures, treat-
ment modalities and short-term outcomes). As shown in
Table 1, it was the only source that could clearly be used
to describe the theories of FN. We selected some of the
major concepts of FN, which we have attempted to
describe in the text below (“Detailed results”) in order
to capture the theoretical framework of FN, as pre-
sented in this book.
Scientific articles
The selection process is summarized in Fig. 1. Three
case reports, one controlled trial, and one randomized
controlled trial were found in our areas of inquiry in the
selected databases. Six case reports were found through
hand searching, including three in the journal Func-
tional Neurology, Rehabilitation, and Ergonomics. Lists
of publications obtained from known FN researchers
and/or practitioners did not provide any additional
relevant material. Nevertheless, the scientific literature
provided information on diagnostic procedures, treat-
ment modalities, treatment plans and clinical outcomes
for various conditions. The controlled trial and the
randomized controlled trial provided information only
on diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities (see
Additional file 3 for details). Moreover, two case studies

 did not report the treatment plan and, another case
study did not report the brain areas targeted by the
treatment. There was no disagreement between the two
authors who independently collected the information
from the scientific literature.
Websites
The search for information on the internet was saturated
fairly quickly. We did not find any new information after
reading the full content of the first five websites on
Google. These all belonged to chiropractors practicing
in the United States. The internet search provided
particular information on the indications, diagnostic
procedures, and treatment plans. Only one website pro-
vided information on treatment in relation to a specific-
ally targeted area in the brain. Furthermore, the websites
generally gave only general information about the ex-
pected outcomes following FN treatment. One website
did not provide information about the diagnostic tests
used by the chiropractors and two websites did not
provide relevant information related to treatment plans
except to say that they were individualized.
Interviews
The first interview lacked somewhat in clarity and thus
served as a pilot interview. However, the following three
interviews provided clear and extensive answers to our
questions. All four interviews could be used in this study
as
they
provided
fairly
homogeneous
information.
Therefore it was deemed unnecessary to collect data
from additional practitioners. The transcripts sent to the
participants needed only few minor revisions on their
part; three of them gave us feedback. The interviews in-
formed us mainly about indications, diagnostic tests, and
treatment modalities. We were able to collect less infor-
mation related to treatment plans (3/4 informants) and
expected outcomes, for which only general information
was provided. The tabulated transcriptions (available in
Additional file 2c) made by the first author and the other
PhD student revealed no obvious difference in their
content.
In the section below, the theories of FN are reported
first in relation to the neurophysiology, thereafter in
terms of treatment implementations. This work aims to
provide a basic description of these theories and does
not pretend to cover them in depth. Although we
attempted to report these theories of FN faithfully, the
text below represents our understanding of FN derived
from this study, which does not necessarily depict the
official view of FN. Finally, the five different aspects of
the clinical applications of FN are discussed, based on
our four sources of information.
Detailed results
Neurophysiological theories: (information from textbook)
The practice of FN includes the detection, evaluation
and conservative treatment of functional aberrations of
the neuraxis, especially of the brain [32]. Within FN,
neurological aberrations are named “physiological le-
sions” or “functional lesions”. They are stated to be the
cause of a large number of unlabeled, poorly labeled or
misunderstood symptoms in the medical field (e.g. neu-
rodevelopmental disorders, movement disorders) [33].
By the same reasoning, FN proposes explanations also
for musculoskeletal disorders.
These “physiological lesions” are described as revers-
ible due to the neuroplastic properties of the nervous
system and may affect any parts of the nervous system.
“Physiological lesions” are different from “ablative le-
sions” that are defined as only potentially and very
slowly reversible, as they have resulted from death of
neuronal tissues (e.g. post-stroke). These two types of le-
sions would lead to very similar symptoms and could co-
exist [34].
The textbook information on the neurophysiological
rationale of FN can be broadly classified under three
headings:
1. Cellular level,
2. Related neurological pathways,
3. The FN concept of “hemisphericity”.
For each of these, we found:
1. A description and interpretation of core
neurophysiological and/or neuroanatomical
information,
2. A description of consequences when the
neurophysiology goes wrong (possible disorders and
symptoms), which, may or may not represent the
generally acceptable view in the scientific world,
3. Methods to test the integrity of various groups of
neurons, most often indirectly, especially those
located in the brain.
Some of the major components of the theoretical
framework of FN will be reported following the above
classification.
Cellular level: (information from textbook)
At a cellular level, the central tenet of FN is that symp-
toms result from a dysfunctional “central integrative
state” (CIS) of one or several functional units of neurons
within the nervous system (e.g. group of neurons of the
right dentate nucleus). In other words, a “physiological
lesion” corresponds to a group of neurons with a dys-
functional CIS. More precisely, such lesions would occur
Meyer et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2017) 25:19 
Page 6 of 23
 following disturbances of neuronal physiology that in
turn would affect communication within the central ner-
vous system, leading to hyper and/or hypo-functional
area(s) within certain areas of the brain. In response to
this altered function, the concerned area(s) would send
an abnormal quantity of outputs, i.e. too many or not
enough, causing diverse motor, sensory, visceral or
cognitive symptoms such as the ones listed in Table 2
and discussed later in this text [34]. In general, a
“physiological lesion” is said to affect only one side of a
brain structure (e.g. one side of the cerebellum or one
cortical hemisphere), leading to asymmetries of outputs
(aspect discussed later in section “The FN concept of
“hemisphericity””).
The CIS of a functional group of neurons appears to
be considered as the “state of health” of those neurons.
This state is said to be determined by three parameters
that allow the survival and function of neurons: i) oxy-
gen supply, ii) nutritional supply, and iii) stimulation, i.e.
synaptic activation [34]. These three parameters have to
be in an adequate amount to ensure a “healthy” CIS.
Many factors, mainly external, would negatively modify
the state of health of a functional group of neurons. An
immobilization in a cast, an acute anoxic episode after

 attempting suicide, or an inappropriately performed
spinal manipulation are examples of such proposed
external factors [35, 36].
Evaluating the CIS of the different units of neurons of
the central nervous system, especially those of the brain,
is the central aim of the clinical examination within FN.
As it cannot be performed directly, it is mainly evaluated
through a detailed analysis of the responses of different
effectors tested during the patient’s examination. These
responses are proposed to be, to a large extent, deter-
mined by the CIS of the presynaptic neuronal pool(s)
projecting to the neurons ending at the tested effector.
A major sign of a dysfunctional CIS is described as a
“fatigability” of the tested neurons, which means that the
response to a continued or repeated stimulus cannot be
sustained as it should [33]. An effector has to be tested
bilaterally in order to find the faulty side, because of the
concept of asymmetrical function of two parts of a brain
structure. In addition, as a “physiological lesion” can
result in symptoms qualified as “subclinical”, functional
neurologists have to attempt to detect “minor” asymmet-
ries. This concept, in FN that “minor” asymmetries are
clinically relevant, makes up one of the big differences
between FN and classical neurology [33].
Related neurological pathways: (information from textbook)
To assess the CIS of one or several neuronal units and
to elaborate an individualized treatment plan, solid
knowledge in neuroanatomy is needed, as a “physio-
logical lesion” could occur at any point along a neural
pathway. Some pathways are identified as being of
particular importance to a FN assessment, such as the
cortico-reticulo-spinal tract that is described as begin-
ning at a cortical hemisphere, passing mainly through the
ipsilateral pontomedullary reticular formation (PMRF)
and terminating, for most of the fibers, in the ipsilateral
spinal cord [34]. We will use this particular pathway as an
example to illustrate FN reasoning.
For functional neurologists, the importance of this
pathway would relate to its following roles:
– Ipsilateral facilitation of muscle tone,
– Ipsilateral inhibition of anterior muscles above the
spinal level of T6 and of posterior muscles below T6,
– Ipsilateral inhibition of pain sensation,
– Ipsilateral inhibition of sympathetic nervous system.
These functions are described as the result of the nor-
mal activation of the PMRF by the ipsilateral cerebral
cortex.
In fact, this is a key pathway in FN, said to become
disturbed if a “physiological lesion” on one side of the
brain, in FN named “hemisphericity”, decreases the
PMRF outputs. This decrease is described to be due to
the decrease of the cortical outputs to the PMRF. Clinic-
ally, this would lead to:
– A global ipsilateral decrease of muscle tone,
– A “flexor angulation” of the ipsilateral upper limb
and an “extensor angulation” of the ipsilateral lower
limb, a posture known in FN as “pyramidal paresis”,
– One or more ipsilateral pain syndrome(s),
– An ipsilateral increase of sympathetic activity
leading to a number of autonomic signs (e.g.
increase of blood pressure, increased sweating, large
pupil size) [34].
Combined, these clinical signs indicate that the patient
would suffer from a “hemisphericity”, further discussed
below.
The FN concept of “hemisphericity”: (information from
textbook)
The concept of “hemisphericity” (also termed “cortical
lateralization” or “brain asymmetry”) appears to be spe-
cific to FN, referring to a cerebral hemisphere suffering
from a dysfunctional CIS. Thus, this is a “physiological
lesion” that does not refer to a recognized pathological
lesion such as a brain lesion caused by a stroke. Usually,
it describes the side where the cortical activity is stated
to be decreased. Within the FN framework, this concept
rests on the assumptions that the two hemispheres: i)
control different body functions, and ii) can function at
two different levels of activation without there being an
obvious pathology [34].
Widespread consequences are thought to result from
this one-sided “physiological lesion”, including: cognitive
(e.g. attention deficit disorder / attention deficit and
hyperactivity
disorder),
psychiatric
(e.g.
depression),
motor (e.g. muscle weakness), immune (e.g. systematic
lupus erythematosus), and autonomic manifestations
[32] (e.g. asymmetry of blood pressure). It is also
considered that “hemisphericity” may lead to spinal
manifestations and conditions such as: “subluxation”,
modifications of the spinal curves, spondylosis, muscle
stiffness, and muscles weakness of the intrinsic spinal
muscles [34]. Such diagnoses, symptoms, or findings
orientate the functional neurologist to the side of the
dysfunctional hemisphere.
In addition to these clinical manifestations and to
signs evoked above in relation to disturbance of the
control of the PMRF outputs, other signs could be
searched for and additional tests performed to diagnose
a “hemisphericity”. Among them there are:
– Eye movement dysfunction(s),
– Contralateral cerebellar sign(s),
Meyer et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2017) 25:19 
Page 8 of 23
 – Contralateral enlargement of the physiological blind
spot of the eye, an, apparently, original concept of
FN (see [9] or [33] for details about measurement of
the physiological blind spot).
In fact, any neurological dysfunction that can be re-
lated somehow to aberrant cortical outputs is considered
potentially relevant [37].
The concept of the physiological blind spot deserves
some explanation because it belongs to the history of
FN. In classical textbooks, the blind spot (optic disc) is
described as the area of the retina devoid of photorecep-
tors, i.e. the area where converging retinal ganglion cells
exit the eyeball to form the optic nerve. The perimeter
of the blind spot can be mapped out during the examin-
ation of the visual field to detect some eye pathologies
and to follow their progress [38]. However, FR Carrick
[9] presents the claim that, in the absence of an eye
pathology, the size of the blind spot can be altered in re-
sponse to the CIS of the visual cortex and, by extension,
the CIS of one hemisphere, which in turn would depend
to a large extent of the afferent inputs it receives from
the thalamus through the thalamocortical radiations.
Related to this concept, spinal manipulation occupies a
prominent place in FN, principally because of its pro-
posed supra-segmental effects. Indeed, it is stated that
spinal manipulation is able to generate changes in the
size of the blind spot because of the afferent stimulation
it would provide to the thalamus, in this way affecting
the amount of afferent inputs to the cortex by the thal-
amus. Thus, manipulation is stated to have a direct
effect on the brain, a central tenet within FN [32, 34].
This leads us to discuss the theories surrounding the
treatment in FN.
Treatment theories: (information from textbook)
The aim of FN treatment is to restore the optimal me-
tabolism within the targeted neurons, i.e. the neurons
constituting the “physiological lesion(s)”, in order to pro-
mote positive neuroplastic changes. By this process,
normalization of their efferent outputs and thus a
resolution (at least partial) of the patient’s symptoms is
expected. This treatment is often multi-facetted and
could include manual therapy but also the application
of, for example, sensory, motor, or cognitive stimuli.
Some such treatments were described in our four
sources of information and were reported below in the
section “Treatment modalities”.
Some rules are proposed to be followed for imple-
menting a treatment in FN, specifically that: 1) the
intensity of the stimulus has to be progressive and
adapted to the degree of “fatigability” of the targeted
group(s) of neurons; 2) the type of the stimuli and the
side of their application depend on the characteristics of
the stimulated pathways; 3) the stimuli have to be re-
peated and a single “physiological lesion” can be affected
by several kinds of stimuli; and 4) the effects of treat-
ment have to be assessed regularly by testing the positive
indicators found during the initial clinical examination
(e.g. assessing the decrease or the increase of “fatigabil-
ity”) [39].
Concerning the intensity of the stimulus and the ne-
cessity of reassessing regularly the “fatigability” of the
patient’s nervous system, in FN it is considered that neu-
rons suffering from a dysfunctional CIS may be not able
to support either an overly intense stimulation or too
many repetitions of stimuli. The risk would be to aggra-
vate the “physiological lesion(s)” [34]. This implies that
parameters such as the “fatigability” of a group of neu-
rons vary during treatment, appearing as a barometer of
the treatment dose that the patient would be able to
support.
In regards to the type and side of stimulation, these
parameters refer to the fact that a variety of treatment
modalities exist for acting on various parts of the ner-
vous system. The choice of the type of stimuli depends
on the targeted group(s) of neurons. The side on which
they are delivered depends on whether the pathway that
goes to the targeted neurons is crossed or uncrossed. In
other words, a treatment modality is chosen for its ex-
pected ability to alter neuronal communication along a
pathway until it reaches the “physiological lesion” of
interest. For example, to reverse a “physiological lesion”
of the left parietal cortex, the application of a source of
vibration to joints of the right side of the body may be
chosen [40]. Finally, the stimuli have to be repeated in
the perspective of re-training the nervous system in
order to cause lasting neuroplastic changes. The treat-
ment is therefore dependent on the assumed area(s) of
the defect nervous system and thus the same treatment
can be provided for a multitude of diagnoses/symptoms.
Clinical application of FN: (information from all four
sources)
Indications: (information from all four sources)
All the groups of indications we identified were found in
at least three of our four sources of information. Indica-
tions of FN are multiple with an emphasis on brain-
related
dysfunctions.
Thus,
according
to
our
four
sources, FN would be suitable to manage neuromuscu-
loskeletal disorders, symptoms related to traumatic brain
injuries, neurologic diseases or disorders, psychiatric
disorders, and various neurologic or non-neurologic
isolated symptoms. In addition, three sources showed
that this approach would also be suitable for various
conditions which did not fit with any of these groups of
indications (see Table 2).
Meyer et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2017) 25:19 
Page 9 of 23
 Among these indications, the following specific exam-
ples were reported by at least two sources: low back pain,
neck pain, radiculopathies, peripheral neuropathies, upper
and
lower extremity
conditions,
Parkinson’s
disease,
multiple sclerosis, dystonias, migraines, complex regional
pain syndrome, attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention
deficit
and
hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD),
dyslexia,
anxiety
disorders,
depression,
post-traumatic
stress
disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD), balance
disorders, and vertigo. Additional indications are listed in
Table 2. In fact, several specific examples collected on the
websites or through the interviews were apparently not
reported in the literature.
Examination procedures: (information from all four sources)
As in other health disciplines, a detailed medical history
is collected and the patient is observed, thus providing
the first clues about which areas of the nervous system
may present a physiological dysfunction. In addition,
vital signs may be assessed and a general physical exam-
ination can be conducted. Complementary exams, e.g.
magnetic resonance imaging and video-nystagmography,
can also be recommended in order to detect/exclude a
severe pathology and/or to supplement the functional
neurological diagnosis.
However, the main aspect is the functional neurology
examination. Table 3 provides a summary of diagnostic
procedures used in FN according to our four sources. All of
them reported the use of tests to assess the following:
autonomic nervous system, sensory and motor components
of
spinal
nerves,
cranial
nerves,
reflexes,
vestibulo-
cerebellar system, cortical lobes and/or hemispheres, and
cognition. The majority also reported assessing the basal
ganglia. Specific tests are also mentioned, some of which
are used to assess several structures or functions. For
example, eye movements are used to assess the vestibulo-
cerebellar system, the brainstem and/or the cerebral cortex,
and finger-to-nose test is used for assessing the cerebellum
and/or indirectly the cortical hemispheres.
Importantly, while most of the tests reported in Table 3
are commonly used in conventional neurological examin-
ation (e.g. myotomes and Romberg’s test) or in non-
neurological examinations (e.g. vital signs), some of them
are unusual or used differently in FN. The blind spot map-
ping is an example of such an unusual diagnostic test. The
measurement of the vital signs to assess the CIS of the
autonomic nervous system, which in turn is said to be able
to reflect the CIS of cortical hemispheres, is an example of
usual tests used and interpreted differently to what would
usually be the case. This relationship between vital signs,
autonomic nervous system and the CIS of the cortical
hemispheres is said to be mediated by the cortico-
reticulo-spinal tract (described in the section “Related
neurological pathways”).
Tests may be used also without any obvious clinical
indication and the interpretation of their results appears
to be specific to FN, i.e. identification of one or more
“physiological lesions”. The assessment of the cerebellar
functions in a context of mechanical low back pain with
spinal root compression illustrates the apparent “gap”
between the clinical condition and the tests selected by
the therapist [36]. In other words, to an “ordinary” clin-
ician it would not be clear in which way tests of the
cerebellar function would be relevant in mechanical low
back pain.
It is our understanding that clinicians may take an
individual approach to their diagnostic tests; either
choosing specific tests based on the initial interview and
observation of the patient or performing tests in order
to screen for affected areas of the nervous system. It also
appears that all tests are not used by all FN clinicians.
Treatment modalities: (information from all four sources)
Treatment modalities mentioned by our sources of in-
formation, as listed in Table 4, are coupled with the
parts of the nervous system they are proposed to affect.
As previously stated, treatment modalities appear to be
primarily selected for their expected abilities to stimulate
brain area(s) rather than in relation to the patient’s con-
dition. The table shows how one brain area may be stim-
ulated by several approaches and how one treatment
modality may stimulate several areas. For example, eye
movement exercises and manual therapy may be used to
stimulate both the cortical hemispheres and the cerebel-
lum. Another example is vibration therapy that may be
used for these same areas, i.e. the cortical hemispheres
and the cerebellum, as well as for the basal ganglia. In
fact, the therapeutic modalities appear to include almost
anything that would stimulate the nervous system,
making it difficult to describe a treatment pattern. This
treatment often includes home exercises to regularly
stimulate the nervous system and it is often comple-
mented with nutritional counseling or supplements.
All the sources described the content of the treatment
as individualized.
Treatment plans: (information from scientific literature,
websites and interviews)
Concerning the treatment plans, we analyzed informa-
tion from three sources (the book was excluded). On
this basis, it seems clear that treatment plans are individ-
ualized. During the initial treatment period, regardless
the conditions discussed, several appointments per week
or even per day were proposed to patients. The period
during which these treatment sessions are planned is
variable but typically extended two weeks. Moreover, the
use of home exercises appears quite common in addition
to treatment with the therapist. Very little information is
Meyer et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2017) 25:19 
Page 10 of 23
 given in regard to the long-term strategies of care that
might be established. This information and some details
related to the course of care (e.g. duration of treatment
sessions or home exercises) are available in Table 5.
Clinical outcomes: (information from all four sources)
Finally, we were interested in the factual or expected
clinical outcomes. This is reported in the order of the
scientific “credibility” of the sources. In general, websites
and informants reported for various conditions, relief or
recovery, but most of the time without mentioning the
usual time course of recovery/improvement (see Table 6).
The textbook [36] reported on six different cases: i)
complex regional pain syndrome, ii) migraines associated
with vertigo, iii) ADHD, iv) depression, v) low back pain
with spinal root compression, and vi) symptoms related to
treatment by spinal manipulation. For these patients, clin-
ical outcomes were reported as positive in general after
twelve weeks, whether partial or complete. No clinical
outcomes were reported beyond this period of treatment.

 We found seven case studies in the literature reporting
on: i) Landau-Kleffner syndrome [41], ii) complex regional
pain syndrome [42], iii) cervical dystonia [43], iv) mi-
graines, ADHD, OCD and Tourette’s syndrome [44], v)
Parkinson’s disease [45], vi) idiopathic hemi-paresthesia
[40], and vii) ADHD, primary nocturnal enuresis and
musculoskeletal pain [46]. Two case studies were found
that reported on symptoms post-traumatic brain injury
[47, 48]. For these case reports, clinical outcomes were re-
ported at various time intervals as positive, whether partial
[41–48] or complete [40, 42, 44, 47]. Two case studies [42,
45] reported long term clinical outcomes, both describing
patients as improved. One case study [46] reports the out-
comes three months after cessation of care, describing the
patient as being improved. No randomized controlled tri-
als were found that could confirm the therapeutic effect of
FN approach as a supplement to “traditional” chiropractic
on any clinical outcome (for more information see
Table 6). In fact, to the authors’ knowledge, no study
design other than case-reports currently exist that de-
scribe therapeutic outcome in symptomatic patients.
Discussion
Brief summary of findings
To our knowledge, this is the first article to provide
an overview of the theoretical framework and the
clinical applications of FN, in the context of chiro-
practic manual therapy. In short, FN is described as a
therapeutic approach that could be used for a large
array of conditions, provided that the cause of such
conditions can be traced primarily to parts of the
central nervous system. The diagnosis is performed
through the use of many conventional, but also more
unusual tests, with a very “fine-tuned” interpretation
of test results. In some cases, the fine tuning consists
of
looking
for
minor
asymmetry
and
“subclinical
lesions”. Treatment consists of various activities or
therapies that are thought to affect clusters of neu-
rons that have been diagnosed as dysfunctional. The
initial treatment plan appears intense with several
sessions per week or even per day. After this initial
intervention
period,
it
seems
that
the
clinical
outcomes are generally reported as positive, whether
partial or complete, regardless of the condition of the
patient (e.g. Parkinson’s disease, low back pain with
radiculopathy).
Methodological considerations
This information was obtained through a scoping re-
view that included four sources: i) one textbook of
FN, ii) eleven articles from the scientific literature, iii)
the websites of five chiropractors proficient in FN,
and iv) a semi-structured interview of four chiroprac-
tors who practice FN daily. As our research purpose
was broad and FN is not well documented in the sci-
entific or academic literature, we performed a scoping
review rather than a number of rigorous systematic
reviews,
using
for
this
multiple
sources
of
information.
Our four sources helped us cover our six research
objectives. However, the book was the only material
that we used for the theoretical background of FN as
it
extensively
informed
us
on
its
fundamental
concepts. Few scientific articles were found in relation
to our areas of inquiry; most of them case studies.
Thus, websites of FN practitioners and the interviews
were needed to collect enough information to make it
possible to provide a clear and consistent picture of
what
constitutes
FN.
The
latter
two
sources,
i.e.
websites and interviews, were also selected to fit the
recommendations for conducting scoping studies [27, 28].
The representativeness of our sources of information
and the validity of the extruded information seem to be
satisfactory,
as
discussed
below.
Perhaps
other
re-
searchers using alternative sources of information may
have obtained varying results but it is our opinion that
this review has reasonably captured the spirit and nature
of FN, as there was good agreement between the various
sources.
We decided to restrict the present review to FN
theories and their clinical applications in the chiro-
practic
context,
i.e.
we
were
interested
only
in
sources that included the use of manual therapy.
Thus, the work presented here does not depict the
whole field of FN, which is wide and merits further
explorations. As reported in the introduction, FN is
currently composed of different sub-specialties which
represent various forms of FN practice. These do
not always include manual therapy but choose other
therapeutic strategies, for example eye movement
training [49–51], “hemisphere specific remediation
programs” [52, 53], and music therapy [54].
i) Textbook
Only the first author read the entire book and
collected the relevant information for our work,
which may be a methodological weakness.
However, the understanding of the theoretical
frame of FN was corroborated by the semi-
structured interviews that contained several
questions about fundamental concepts of FN, thus
aiding in understanding. Further, the FN theories
reported here, seem to be in agreement with how
FN is defined by statements produced by some
FN associations [23, 55]. Concerning our research
objectives relating to clinical applications of FN,
the information was straightforward to find
because the textbook is well structured with
Meyer et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2017) 25:19 
Page 19 of 23
 specific chapters dedicated to those topics of
interest to this work. Still, it is possible that some
information may have been missed or
misinterpreted.
ii) Scientific literature
The usual strategy of searching for relevant articles
by key words could not be used as it resulted in only
one relevant article. The reason for this is that the
term “functional neurology” is not usually used in
such publications, maybe because FN covers many
fields of clinical applications. Therefore, relevant
keywords could not be predicted.
Instead, we attempted a search by author, including
at first all authors that appeared to publish in this
area. However, this produced many irrelevant
authors with the same surname and initials.
Therefore, we stopped this strategy after the search
for FR Carrick, RW Beck, G Leisman and R Melillo
in the three selected databases. These four were
selected because they appeared to be central to the
FN movement. Thereafter, on the advice of a
specialist librarian, we wrote directly to these four
authors and authors known to have published with
them, asking them for their lists of publications. In
this way, five publication lists were obtained which
resulted in no additional peer-reviewed articles being
found. One of these authors recommended a search
of the journal Functional Neurology, Rehabilitation,
and Ergonomics. Three additional articles were found
in this journal. Finally, our citation search did not
result in any additional publications. The obstacles
encountered in searching the literature made it
difficult to appreciate if all relevant peer-reviewed
articles were captured. However, all the acquired
literature had the hallmarks of FN, as we had
interpreted it from the other sources, so it is our
impression that we managed to catch the essence
of FN.
The selection of articles for this review was made
independently by the first author and an experienced
researcher in the team. There were no
disagreements between them. Further, the search for
relevant information was also blinded with total
agreement between the two.
iii)Websites
The first author read the websites and collected the
relevant information. These were read twice and
blinded to previous findings. Subsequent readings
would sometimes result in more information being
included but no obvious misunderstandings
appeared in the later readings.
iv) Interviews
Each interview was conducted by the first author
and another PhD student. Each tabulated
transcription was done independently by these two
people, with the option to listen again to the taped
interview. This was necessary only once to clarify
the content of the reply of one of the four
informants to one of the 24 questions. No other
differences between the content of these
transcriptions were found between the interviewers.
Synthesis of findings
According to our review, FN has a well described ra-
tionale that, if correct, has the potential of improving
the lives for many people with a wide variety of con-
ditions which are most often chronic and difficult to
manage. The diagnosis of the neurological lesions in
FN, i.e. the “physiological lesions”, certainly requires a
solid background in central neurology. For chiroprac-
tors
who
embrace
this
approach,
clinical
practice
would surely be both interesting and challenging.
Further, the practice of FN demands an understand-
ing of how to test the various potential lesions. The
interpretation of these tests seems to be very specific
to FN, requiring them to be done bilaterally, attempt-
ing to detect asymmetries which would indicate le-
sions, also at a “subclinical” stage. In addition, the
patient examination appears time consuming given
the numerous tests that are performed, even when
there is no obvious indication for them to be per-
formed. Since these tests are used not only to detect
lesions but also to monitor progress, the whole treat-
ment strategy seems to be based on these tests; they
have great importance, perhaps more than the symp-
toms. For these reasons, it would be relevant for FN
users to assure that all their diagnostic tools are reli-
able and valid.
Since the recommended treatments do not appear to
be noxious, even prolonged treatments are unlikely to
cause any direct physical harm. Notwithstanding the
approach being low risk, there are two other important
aspects which need consideration. Firstly, the choice of
one type of therapy may keep patients away from a
possibly more suitable treatment; hence the need for
comparative studies to determine relative efficacy. Sec-
ondly, frequent treatments during a long period of time
are costly, potentially both to individuals and society,
hence the need to show that they provide better results
than less costly alternatives.
We noticed that the list of conditions amenable to
improvement with FN is large and the conditions vary
in
type.
However,
only
few
of
these
have
been
described in the scientific literature and there seems
to be a lack of studies on the effectiveness of the
treatment. In relation to treatment effect, it may be
difficult to conduct randomized controlled clinical
trials
on
a
treatment
that
concentrates
on
the
Meyer et al. Chiropractic & Manual Therapies  (2017) 25:19 
Page 20 of 23
 underlying lesion(s) rather than on groups of patients
with similar symptoms, because it might be difficult
to find enough patients with sufficiently similar le-
sions to satisfy the methodological requirements for
such studies. Obviously, case reports are not sufficient
to “prove” the benefit of a treatment, unless the con-
dition is truly irreversible and the observations abso-
lutely objective and irrefutable, as many factors other
than the treatment can make a patient feel or appear
improved.
At early follow-up, the clinical outcomes in FN are
generally reported as complete or partial, without a spe-
cific pattern related to the type of condition and/or the
severity of the underlying neurological abnormalities.
However, we could not judge the long-term clinical out-
comes or prognosis for various conditions or in relation
to the diagnosed neurological status from a lack of infor-
mation in our sources. Such outcomes require documen-
tation, to ensure that early improvements endure well
past the initial placebo (honeymoon) effect.
Our
final
impression
of
FN
is
that
it
can
be
described as a complex alternative to the old variant
of the chiropractic subluxation model [56], in which
the chiropractor does not consider symptoms, but in-
stead claims to treat the underlying “cause”. Further-
more, when this “cause” has been removed, symptoms
will diminish or disappear. According to this trad-
itional chiropractic concept, the “cause” is the verte-
bral subluxation.
Likewise with FN, the chiropractor does not deal
directly with the presenting complaint, but is claiming
to treat the underlying “cause”. The main differences
are: i) that the “cause” is not as “simple” as the verte-
bral subluxation but one or more complex dysfunc-
tion(s) of the nervous system (often located in the
brain), and ii) that the treatment is not limited to the
spine and can be quite complex. In sum, the old vari-
ant of the chiropractic subluxation concept is spine-
centered whereas FN embraces the whole nervous
system, with an emphasis on the brain.
Verification of the scientific rationale of the theories
of FN, evaluation of the validity of its treatment pro-
cedures, and consideration of the effectiveness of its
treatments were beyond the remit of this scoping
review. However, given that FN has been subject to
lively criticism [10, 14–16, 20, 21] and the apparent
paucity
of
scientific
documentation
within
the
domains we searched, it would be appropriate to
scrutinize
these
aspects
in
future
studies.
This
requirement would be the same for any therapeutic
approach that is not an accepted part of mainstream
medicine.
The neurological concepts presented by functional
neurologists are varied and difficult to verify without
having access to experts within many fields, willing to
submerge themselves in this topic. A study of the plausi-
bility of the concepts used in FN therefore would appear
to be very difficult and time-consuming. Nevertheless,
such studies may be justified but only if the treatment
approach was tested and found to be valid.
A first step towards a validation of FN would therefore
be to study whether one or several of the therapeutic
tools suggested by the functional neurologists actually
has an objective effect on the nervous system. If so, it
would also be needed to investigate if this effect is clinic-
ally relevant and sustainable. For example, one central
argument in FN is that joint manipulation has a power-
ful effect on the brain [9, 39, 57]. As some research has
been conducted in this area [58–61], a review of the lit-
erature seems timely.
Another necessary, perhaps more simple, approach
would be to test the validity of the clinical tests.
Obviously, the diagnostic procedure has to be reprodu-
cible for the diagnosis to be valid. In turn, it is crucial to
ensure that the treatment effect (if there is one) can be
attributed to the purported mechanisms.
Conclusion
The FN concept that reversible lesions in well-defined areas
of the nervous system, especially of the brain, can be an
identifiable cause of a multitude of disorders, is difficult for
clinicians untrained in FN to verify. Nevertheless, the po-
tential ability to change the quality of life for people suffer-
ing from poorly understood and/or chronic disorders
makes this concept attractive for both clinicians and
patients.
However, there is a need for more transparent documen-
tation on the validity of the various steps normally consid-
ered important in evidence-based practice. In other words,
the scientific community is waiting with interest to learn
more about: i) the plausibility of the rationale of the various
more unusual concepts of FN, ii) the reliability of its clinical
tests and neurological diagnoses, and iii) the effect of
treatment, particularly in relation to spinal manipulation,
whether applied to musculoskeletal complaints or not.
