IMPORTANCE Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play an
important role in the brain’
s response to injury and neurodegenerative processes. It has been
proposed that prolonged microglial activation occurs after single and repeated traumatic
brain injury, possibly through sports-related concussive and subconcussive injuries. Limited in
vivo brain imaging studies months to years after individuals experience a single moderate to
severe traumatic brain injury suggest widespread persistent microglial activation, but there
has been little study of persistent glial cell activity in brains of athletes with sports-related
traumatic brain injury.
OBJECTIVE To measure translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a marker of activated glial cell
response, in a cohort of National Football League (NFL) players and control participants, and
to report measures of white matter integrity.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional, case-control study included young
active (n = 4) or former (n = 10) NFL players recruited from across the United States, and 16
age-, sex-, highest educational level–, and body mass index–matched control participants.
This study was conducted at an academic research institution in Baltimore, Maryland, from
January 29, 2015, to February 18, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Positron emission tomography–based regional measures of
TSPO using [11C]DPA-713, diffusion tensor imaging measures of regional white matter
integrity, regional volumes on structural magnetic resonance imaging, and
neuropsychological performance.
RESULTS The mean (SD) ages of the 14 NFL participants and 16 control participants were 31.3
(6.1) years and 27.6 (4.9) years, respectively. Players reported a mean (SD) of 7.0 (6.4) years
(range, 1-21 years) since the last self-reported concussion. Using [11C]DPA-713 positron
emission tomographic data from 12 active or former NFL players and 11 matched control
participants, the NFL players showed higher total distribution volume in 8 of the 12 brain
regions examined (P < .004). We also observed limited change in white matter fractional
anisotropy and mean diffusivity in 13 players compared with 15 control participants. In
contrast, these young players did not differ from control participants in regional brain
volumes or in neuropsychological performance.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results suggest that localized brain injury and repair,
indicated by higher TSPO signal and white matter changes, may be associated with NFL play.
Further study is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether TSPO signal and
white matter changes in young NFL athletes are related to later onset of neuropsychiatric
symptoms.

ncreasing evidence supports the complex role of microg-
lia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous sys-
tem, in response to brain injury and neurodegenerative
processes.1Widespreadpersistentmicroglialactivationhasbeen

croglial activation occurs after TBI or repeated TBI incurred
through sports-related concussive and subconcussive inju-
ries. New techniques designed to image markers of glial cell ac-
tivation in vivo promise to help uncover whether sports-
related TBI elicits acute and prolonged glial response.
The translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is normally ex-
pressed at low levels in brain tissue but is increased in expres-
sion by activated microglia, as well as reactive astrocytes.4
Therefore, TSPO is a proposed biomarker for brain injury and
repair that can now be measured in living patients using radio-
tracersandpositronemissiontomographic(PET)imaging.5,6Re-
cently,wecharacterizedtheuseof[11C]DPA-713withPETtoim-

In vivo study of brain tissue changes in athletes playing
collision sports has largely focused on detection of white mat-
ter tract changes using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which
is based on the estimates of water movement in brain tissue.10
Previous studies suggest widespread changes in white mat-
ter diffusion indices over one season of high school participa-
tioninacollisionsport.11-13Whitematterdiffusionindiceshave
also been reported in collegiate football players studied 6
months after concussion,14 although changed white matter in-
tegritymaybeclinicallysilentinhighschoolandcollegiateath-
letes with TBI.11,13
Here we combined high-resolution brain [11C]DPA-713 PET
with assessment of white matter integrity, regional volumes,
and neuropsychological performance in a new population of
young active and former NFL players. Data from players were
compared with data from control participants who were
matched to players in age, sex, highest educational level, and
body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared). We tested the hypothesis that
players have higher [11C]DPA-713 PET signal and altered white
matter integrity compared with control participants. Rather
than focusing on older former NFL players,9 we focused on
young players because they are temporally closer to NFL play
andatlessriskforcerebrovasculardisease,whichmayalsogen-
erate positive signal on TSPO PET.15
Methods
Human Participants
A Johns Hopkins institutional review board approved this
study, which was conducted from January 29, 2015, to Feb-
ruary 18, 2016. All participants provided written informed con-
sent. National Football League players engaged in active play
and those who were recently retired (defined as within 12 years
of stopping play) were recruited through personal referrals by
one of the authors (C.J.N.) and word of mouth. Male control
participants were recruited through local advertising and com-
pleted a careful clinical interview to ensure stable health.
Clinical Assessment and Neuropsychological Testing
Participantsunderwentastandardizedexaminationbyaboard-
certified psychiatrist that included questions about past and
currentathleticpursuits(includingparticipationinfootballand
TBI for the NFL players) and medical and psychiatric history,
as well as family history of neuropsychiatric illness (includ-
ing dementia and affective illness). Details about NFL play and
past concussion, as defined by the Quality Standards Subcom-
mittee of the American Academy of Neurology,16 were ob-
tained from the NFL players by self-report. Participants com-
pleted the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D).17
Control participants denied history of substance depen-
dence, neurological disorder, subjective cognitive symp-
toms,participationincollegiateorprofessionalcollisionsports,
and TBI. Participants denied current use of anti-inflamma-
tory treatment, including over-the-counter medications, and
all were assessed for TSPO (rs6971) genotype as previously
described.7
Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological
tests (eTable 1 in the Supplement), from which we chose rep-
resentative tests for this study (eAppendix 1 in the Supple-
ment).

Supplement and are identical to those previously described.9
Key Points
Question Is localized brain injury, indicated by higher translocator
protein signal and white matter changes, linked to National
Football League (NFL) play?
Findings In this cross-sectional, case-control study of young NFL
players compared with control participants, players showed higher
translocator protein positron emission tomographic signal in 8 of
12 regions examined. Limited significant white matter changes
were also observed in NFL players compared with control
participants, although players and control participants did not
differ in regional brain volumes or neuropsychological
performance.
Meaning These results suggest that localized brain injury may be
associated with NFL play, although further study is needed to test
links to onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging Acquisition
Participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) on a Phillips Achieva 3-T scanner for structural T1-
weighted imaging (3-dimensional MPRAGE) with 1 × 1 × 1–mm
resolution and DTI. Diffusion tensor imaging parameters in-
cluded single-shot echoplanar imaging; b-value of 700
seconds/mm2; 32 diffusion-weighting orientations with 5 b0
images; 70 gapless whole-brain axial sections of 2.2-mm thick-
ness;matrixof96 × 96,fieldofviewof212 × 212mm,andzero-
filled to 256 × 256 mm. DtiStudio was used for data
processing.19Motionandeddycurrentweremonitoredandcor-
rected with an in-house affine transformation with a cost func-
tion based on tensor fitting.20 Gradient tables were compen-
sated for rotational motion. Tensor fitting was performed by
a RESTORE-type in-house outlier rejection method.21
Data Analysis and Statistics
PET Data Analysis
The software package PMOD (version 3.3; PMOD Technolo-
gies Ltd) was used in the initial PET image processing and ki-
netic analysis. Interframe motion correction and PET-MRI
coregistration were completed as previously described.9 Cor-
tical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation of T1-
weighted MRIs were performed with the FreeSurfer image
analysis suite (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Twelve
regions of interest (ROIs), identical to those used previously,9
were selected for this study: right and left side hippocampus,
parahippocampus,entorhinalcortex,amygdala,temporalpole,
and supramarginal gyrus (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Total
cortical gray matter (GM) and total intracranial volume (ICV)
were also defined using FreeSurfer for use in secondary
analyses exploring the effect of (1) clinical characteristics on
[11C]DPA-713 binding in GM and (2) ROI volume normalized to
ICV on regional binding.18 The primary PET-based regional
binding outcome was total distribution volume (VT).22
Positron emission tomographic time-activity curves were
generated for all participants using the ROI definitions. Based
on the time-activity curves obtained, VT within each ROI was
estimated using Logan graphical analysis23 (t* = 30 minutes)
with the metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input func-
tion. Plasma free fraction (fP) was measured using rapid equi-
librium dialysis as previously described18 and VT corrected for
fP (VT/fP) was calculated.
DTI Data Analyses
Diffusion tensor imaging data were analyzed by automated
white matter segmentation using MriStudio software.24,25
Briefly, an atlas with defined white matter regions (JHU “Eve”
Atlas) was warped to each patient image using large deforma-
tion diffeomorphic metric mapping implemented in Diffeo-
Map software. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusiv-
ity (MD) values of the 8 predefined white matter structures
(eFigure 2 in the Supplement) were then measured using
RoiEditor. These white matter regions were selected because
they contain long fibers that collectively project from subcor-
tical structures to widespread cortical tissue. Long axonal pro-
jections are potentially more vulnerable to axonal injury from
rapidbiomechanicalforcesinducedbyhitstothehead.26While
studies implicate varied sites of white matter change after
sports-related concussion,27 we focused on right and left side
anterior, superior, and posterior corona radiata, as well as pos-
terior thalamic radiation (PTR), because postseason changes
in corona radiata and PTR have been observed in young ath-
letesplayingcollisionsports.11,12,28Usinga3-dimensionalatlas-
based approach, we overcame the limitation of tract-based
methods in defining thalamic radiations, which are difficult
to define using a 2-dimensional plane.29
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses of the primary PET outcome measure,
regional VT, were performed with multivariate general linear
modeling using SPSS Statistics (version 22.0; IBM Corp). We
modeled the VT values obtained from the 12 selected ROIs
based on their relationship to between-participant factors,
including cohort (NFL player or control) and TSPO genotype
(C/C: high affinity binder and C/T: mixed affinity binder) as
independent fixed factors. Participants with genotype T/T
were excluded from this analysis of PET data owing to the
low affinity of [11C]DPA-713 for TSPO in individuals with T/T
genotype. Similar analyses were repeated for regional
values, VT/fP.
All other statistical analyses were performed using R (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing).30 Demographic and
clinical characteristics of NFL players vs control participants
were compared using 2-sample t tests for continuous vari-
ables and Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Data were
expressed as mean (SD) unless otherwise noted.
The threshold for significance in all statistical tests involv-
ing regional VT and regional volume measures was set as
P < .004, taking into account the 12 ROIs using Bonferroni cor-
rection (0.05/12 ≈ 0.0042). The threshold for significance in
all statistical tests involving the 8 white matter regions tested
was set as P < .006 (approximately 0.05/8). Statistical signifi-
cance was otherwise defined as P < .05, except where other-
wise noted.
Results
Study Population
Demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics of the
NFL players and control participants are in Table 1. A total of
14 NFL players (4 active and 10 recently retired; ages 24-39
years) and 16 control individuals (ages 21-37 years) partici-
pated. The 10 former NFL players ended NFL play in a period
that spanned a range of 1 to 144 months prior to participation.
Playersreportedamean(SD)of7.0(6.4)years(range,1-21years)
since the last self-reported concussion. Other self-reported de-
tails about NFL play are listed in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
On the HAM-D, 1 of the 14 players scored a 14, consistent with
moderate depressive symptoms, and 1 player scored an 11, in-
dicatingmilddepressivesymptoms.Allotherparticipantswere
without depressive symptoms (HAM-D < 8). A summary of the
number of participants in each cohort with data from [11C]DPA-
713 PET imaging, structural MRI, DTI, and neuropsychologi-
cal testing is in eTable 3 in the Supplement.

Neuropsychological Assessment of Former NFL Players
and Control Participants
Three control participants did not undergo neuropsychologi-
cal assessment. Neuropsychological test results from the 1
player with a HAM-D score of 14 were excluded owing to his
scores on a performance validity measure (Word Memory
Test).31 There were no differences in neuropsychological test
scores between the remaining 13 players and 13 control par-
ticipants after correction for multiple comparisons (Table 2).
Structural MRI and Volumetric Analyses
No evidence of structural abnormality was present on T1-
weightedMRI.QuantitativeanalysisoftheMRI-basedsegmen-
tation results for the 12 ROIs showed no significant difference
betweenyoungNFLplayersandcontrolparticipantsinregional
volume normalized to ICV (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

Diffusion Tensor Imaging
Diffusion tensor imaging data from 1 player and 1 control par-
ticipant were excluded owing to severe motion artifact and
claustrophobia limiting scan time, respectively. Of the 13 NFL
players and 15 control participants with DTI data, FA values
were significantly lower in the right posterior thalamic radia-
tion of NFL players compared with control participants
(Table 3). Mean diffusivity values in the left anterior corona

trol participants.

structural organization, and symptoms. The increased
expression of TSPO by activated glia (microglia and reactive
astrocytes) is the basis of several promising PET-based
imaging methods to measure brain injury and repair in
vivo.6,38-42
The current study extends our earlier findings of higher
regional [11C]DPA-713 VT values in older former NFL players
compared with control participants9 to a new cohort of
younger NFL players compared with matched control partici-
pants (Figure 1). We measured TSPO binding in the same
temporal and parietal cortical regions as well as the mesial
temporal lobe structures as in our previous study. Visual
inspection of [11C]DPA-713 parametric PET images implicates
high binding in the thalamus and midbrain regions in young
NFL players as well (Figure 2). The collective results from this
and our previous study suggest potential vulnerability of the
supramarginal gyrus to injury from TBI in football that war-
rants further investigation. Furthermore, higher TSPO signal
in the left temporal pole and mesial temporal lobe structures
of young NFL players compared with control participants
provides in vivo evidence of hypothesized vulnerability of
these regions to biomechanical forces incurred through
sports-related TBI.26
We aimed to assess TSPO signal in parallel with white mat-
terorganization,regionalvolume,andneuropsychologicalper-
formance. Looking across the widespread white matter area
covered by bilateral subsections of the coronal radiata and bi-
lateral PTR, we observed lower FA, a nonspecific but poten-
tial indicator of lower white matter integrity, in the right PTR
of the NFL players compared with control participants. Mean
diffusivity, often observed as inverse of FA and reflecting the
magnitude of white matter change,10 was higher in NFL play-
ers compared with control participants in the left anterior
corona radiata. Irrespective of these white matter diffusion
findings, we did not see a difference in regional volumes nor-
malized to ICV, nor difference in performance on selected neu-
ropsychological tests between these cohorts of young indi-
viduals. Marked pathological changes to susceptible brain
regions and associated cognitive, affective, and behavioral
symptoms may take decades to emerge after participation in
collision sport.26,43 Together our results support emerging evi-
dence from mouse studies of persistent microglial activation
after head trauma that may increase susceptibility to later cog-
nitive deficits.44,45 Therefore, therapeutic and preventive in-
terventions before onset of clinical decline may be possible.
Strengths and Limitations
A strength of this study is the focus on relatively young NFL
players who are closer to the time of play and are less likely
to have cerebrovascular disease, which is independently
associated with inflammation and white matter changes.
Still, the players in this study reported a mean (SD) of 7.0
(6.4) years since last concussion. The temporal relationship
between increased TSPO expression and sports-related TBI
may be best elucidated using a longitudinal design with
[11C]DPA-713 PET imaging from the time of measured head
impact. It is also important to note that [11C]DPA-713 PET sig-
nal is only an indirect measure of microglial activation in the
living brain, and DTI outcome measures, such as FA and MD,
are only indirectly representative of underlying white matter
structure. Our results support further in vitro experiments of
activated microglia and white matter tract anatomy directly
in carefully selected postmortem tissue from players of
all ages.46

Conclusions
By demonstrating higher TSPO PET signal and altered DTI
indices in several brain regions of young NFL players,
we support future use of [11C]DPA-713 PET and DTI to
examine these markers associated with brain injury and
repair in athletes playing collision sports. Because there
is interest in targeting microglial pathways and immune
modulation to prevent neurodegeneration,37,47,48 further
human studies using [11C]DPA-713 PET and DTI in individu-
als with history of sports-related TBI may inform strategies
for future translational research and immune-based
interventions.
