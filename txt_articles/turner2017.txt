Up to 5% of the US population has suffered anaphylaxis. Fatal
outcome is rare, such that even for people with known venom or
food allergy, fatal anaphylaxis constitutes less than 1% of total
mortality risk. The incidence of fatal anaphylaxis has not
increased in line with hospital admissions for anaphylaxis. Fatal
drug anaphylaxis may be increasing, but rates of fatal
anaphylaxis to venom and food are stable. Risk factors for fatal
anaphylaxis vary according to cause. For fatal drug anaphylaxis,
previous cardiovascular morbidity and older age are risk factors,

radiocontrast injections the commonest triggers. Fatal food
anaphylaxis most commonly occurs during the second and
third decades. Delayed epinephrine administration is a risk
factor; common triggers are nuts, seafood, and in children,
milk. For fatal venom anaphylaxis, risk factors include mid-
dle age, male sex, white race, cardiovascular disease, and
possibly mastocytosis; insect triggers vary by region. Upright
posture is a feature of fatal anaphylaxis to both food and
venom. The rarity of fatal anaphylaxis and the significant
quality of life impact of allergic conditions suggest that
quality of life impairment should be a key consideration
when making treatment decisions in patients at risk for
anaphylaxis.

Between 1.6% and 5.1% of US citizens are estimated to
have experienced anaphylaxis,1 a systemic hypersensitivity re-
action that can be rapidly fatal. An estimated, 1% of hospi-
talizations and 0.1% of emergency department attendances for
anaphylaxis have a fatal outcome.2 Groups at risk of anaphy-
laxis include those with IgE-mediated food allergy (approxi-
mately 5% to 8% of US children and 2% to 3% of adults) and
those with IgE-mediated drug or insect venom allergy.3,4 For
these at-risk groups, the unpredictable possibility of fatal
anaphylaxis can lead to significant anxiety and restriction of
daily activities. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians
with information that can be used to identify and counsel
those individuals at risk of fatal anaphylaxis. We review the
incidence and time trends of fatal anaphylaxis due to the 3
main causes (drugs, food, and insect venom) from recent
studies and summarize risk factors for fatal anaphylaxis asso-
ciated with these triggers.
FATAL DRUG ANAPHYLAXIS
Epidemiology
Drugs are the most common reported cause of fatal anaphy-
laxis in several countries, including Australia, New Zealand,
United Kingdom, Brazil, and United States.5-10 Recent epide-
miological data are summarized in Table I. Rates of fatal drug-
induced anaphylaxis estimated from national death certification
data,15 or defined anaphylaxis registries,14,16,17 show inconsistent
evidence of increasing incidence, in contrast to other causes of
fatal anaphylaxis. In the United States, using International
Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) categorization, the esti-
mated fatal drug anaphylaxis rate increased significantly from
0.27 per million population in 1999-2001 to 0.51 per million
population in 2008-2010.6 The year 1999 was the first year
when ICD-10 codes were used to record deaths in the US Na-
tional Mortality database, raising the possibility of a code shift
underlying the reporting increase.6 A significant increase was also
noted in an Australian ICD-10-based report, between 1997 and
2005,7 and an overall rate of increase of 5.6% per year over the
period 1997-2013.18 In contrast, an increase has not been re-
ported in the United Kingdom, according to data from a national
fatal anaphylaxis registry.14 Problems with current ICD-10-based
anaphylaxis mortality coding have been recently detailed.15 Fig 1
shows the range of estimates for fatal drug anaphylaxis incidence.
The risk of fatal drug anaphylaxis is seen to be low compared
with other population mortality risks.
Not all drug anaphylaxis studies report fatalities, and it is
unclear whether the drugs causing nonfatal anaphylaxis are the
same as those causing fatal or near-fatal anaphylaxis. Hospitali-
zation could be viewed as a marker of anaphylaxis severity, but
fatal drug anaphylaxis events may occur because of in-patient use
of medication rather than as a consequence of drug-induced
anaphylaxis in the community; and even for hospitalized
anaphylaxis, fatalities are uncommon.14,19,20 In Australia, the
ratio of deaths to hospitalizations relating to non-food anaphy-
laxis was 11:1000.7 The precise proportion of drug anaphylaxis
that results in a fatal outcome is not known. In Denmark, the
30-day mortality of patients admitted for anaphylactic shock (any
cause) was less than 1%, and vasopressor use or mechanical
ventilation was reported in less than 3% of admissions.20 The
latter interventions can be considered as evidence for severe
anaphylaxis21 (and possibly “near-fatal” anaphylaxis, but there is
no consensus over these definitions).
The causative agent in drug-induced anaphylaxis may differ by
country and method of data collection. Antibiotics (predominantly
penicillins and cephalosporins)6,22-24 are often the most common
drugs associated with fatal drug anaphylaxis, although in the United
Kingdom general anesthetics are the most common identified
group, of which neuromuscular blocking agents are the leading
trigger.10,14 Radiocontrast agents are the leading cause in at least
one hospital-based study in South Korea, and also feature promi-
nently in recent studies from Australia and Canada.25-35 Similarly, a
recent US report found that radiocontrast agents caused more fatal
drug anaphylaxis than penicillin and cephalosporins combined.6
This suggested that radiocontrast administration may carry a rela-
tively high “per injection” fatality risk compared with these
frequently
used
antibiotics.36
Although
nonsteroidal
anti-
inflammatory drugs are frequently associated with anaphylaxis,
they do not appear to be a common trigger of fatal anaphylaxis.18
Risk factors
Older age has been consistently associated with higher fatal
drug anaphylaxis rates.6,7,14 In the United Kingdom, the mean age
for fatal drug anaphylaxis was 58 years,14 and in Australia, most
drug anaphylactic fatalities occurred between 55 and 85 years.7
This may be related to increased prevalence of drug allergy due
to increased drug exposure, and increased cardiovascular vulnera-
bility, in older age groups. No consistent gender predilection has
been noted in studies on drug-associated anaphylaxis; however in
the United States, a significant association with African American
ethnicity has been noted.6 The role of comorbidities as a pur-
ported risk for fatal drug anaphylaxis has not been supported in
many studies, and such morbidities are of course common in older
people. However, one recent study reported 71% of fatal drug
anaphylaxis occurred in people with known cardiovascular disease,
and 39% in those with known asthma or emphysema.11 In a
French study of neuromuscular blocker-associated severe anaphy-
laxis (N ¼ 1247), male gender, hypertension, cardiovascular

 disease, obesity, and beta-blocker use were all associated with fatal
outcome, and respiratory disorders were not associated with fatal
outcome.13 Neuromuscular blocking agent anaphylaxis may be
promoted by cross-sensitization induced by the use of a cough
medicine, pholcodine.37-41 This hypothesis is supported by the
reduction of general anesthetic anaphylaxis in Norway after
pholcodine was removed from the market.39 Although antihy-
pertensive drugs are considered risk factors for severe anaphy-
laxis,42-44 this class of drugs was not prominent among confirmed
fatal drug anaphylaxis cases.6,11,14
A small but significant number of fatalities occur due to a drug
administration error, that is, the patient was already known to be
allergic to the relevant drug, or a closely related drug.45 This was
most clearly reported in Australia, where 9 of 27 cases of fatal
penicillin or cephalosporin anaphylaxis were known to be peni-
cillin-allergic.11
Practical implications of fatal drug anaphylaxis data
� Drug-induced anaphylaxis is the most common cause of fatal
anaphylaxis in most regions where data are available, but is rare
relative to nonanaphylactic causes of mortality.
� The incidence of fatal drug anaphylaxis may be increasing, in
contrast to other causes of fatal anaphylaxis.
� People older than 50 years with pre-existing cardiovascular
morbidity appear to be at highest risk for fatal drug anaphy-
laxis, and drug administration errors account for a significant
proportion of cases.
� Beta-lactam antibiotics, muscle relaxants given at general
anesthesia, and injected radiocontrast medium are the com-
monest reported triggers of fatal drug anaphylaxis.
FATAL FOOD ANAPHYLAXIS
Epidemiology
Despite consistent reports of increased incidence in nonfatal
food anaphylaxis over recent decades, a parallel increase in fa-
talities has not, in general, been reported,2,6,11,12,14 with the
exception of one recent Australian study.18 Recent epidemio-
logical data are summarized in Table II. There are unexplained
regional variations, with United Kingdom and Australia report-
ing almost double the rate of fatal, food-related anaphylaxis to
that in the United States. Overall, although food-related
anaphylaxis is relatively common, fatalities remain rare with a
reported range of approximately 0.03 to 0.3 deaths per million
person years in the general population (Fig 1). Case fatality rate is
up to 1%, for medically coded food anaphylaxis, but varies
significantly according to the definition of anaphylaxis used.46,47
The estimated incidence of fatal food anaphylaxis for an indi-
vidual with food allergy (Fig 2) is low and adds little to overall
mortality risk.46 This low level of risk may nevertheless be
important for individuals with food allergy and their carers.49
Regional variations are also seen in the precise triggers
responsible: peanut and tree nuts are the most common reported
triggers in most series; however, recent data suggest that seafood
is a more common cause in Australia.11 In children, cow’s milk is
one of the most common causes in the United Kingdom, perhaps
due to its ubiquitous role in the diet.14 Despite egg being the
most common food allergy in young children in Australia,50
United Kingdom,51 and possibly the United States, it is under-
represented in documented anaphylaxis fatalities.
Risk factors—food
Several risk factors or “coassociations” reported in fatal food
anaphylaxis series are specific to food-triggered cases (Tables I-III).
Risk factors are often identified by individual case reviews, but
variable recording of mortality data, and the absence of suitable
controls limits the ability to reliably distinguish associations from
risk factors, and thus stratify food-allergic individuals according to
risk. Although infants and young children have the highest re-
ported rates of food-related anaphylaxis and subsequent hospital-
ization, fatal food anaphylaxis in this age group is very rare
indeed.2,6,11,14 Overall, there appears to be an age-related predis-
position to fatal outcomes in the second and third decade in some
but not all studies, which is currently unexplained, and is specific
to fatal food anaphylaxis. Most fatal food anaphylaxis occurs in
people with known food allergy, but in many cases prior reactions
were not severe.14 This may partly be because initial reactions
usually occur during the first decade, when reaction severity

 appears to be lower than in the second and third decades. The
delayed use of epinephrine, identified as a significant feature in
several reports of fatal food anaphylaxis,11,12,52-54 is perhaps the
risk factor most amenable to modification. This has, in part,
driven the widespread provision of epinephrine autoinjectors for
the management of anaphylaxis, although controversy exists as to
their use in less severe, nonanaphylactic allergic reactions.55
Although epinephrine is an essential treatment modality in
anaphylaxis, there is no formal controlled trial evidence that
epinephrine or epinephrine autoinjectors effectively prevent fatal
outcome.56 Fatal reactions occur despite timely epinephrine
administration,16 which may relate to the need for more intensive
administration in severe reactions beyond that which can be
administered by autoinjector devices.57,58
Asthma is a well-documented feature in fatal food anaphylaxis
series, affecting approximately 70% to 75% of fatalities in recent
UK and Australian series.11,14 Most fatal food anaphylaxis is
associated with severe respiratory symptoms, with cardiovascular
compromise thought to be secondary to respiratory failure.18 For
example, acute dyspnea was noted in 64% of cases in one
study.11 It therefore seems sensible to optimize asthma man-
agement in individuals at risk of food anaphylaxis. However,
asthma is common in food-allergic individuals, and there are no
good data to differentiate risk on the basis of asthma control.
Indeed, in the UK registry, there is little evidence for an asso-
ciation with poor asthma control or worsening asthma symptoms
leading up to the fatal event.
The presence of ethanol or recreational drugs and upright
posture (eg, during assessment or while in transit to a health care
facility) have been reported as potential risk factors in Australia,
and the latter in the United Kingdom.11,59 Both are biologically
plausible: ethanol or recreational drugs may, through disinhibi-
tion, increase the likelihood of accidental allergen exposure, mask
the early warning signs of anaphylaxis, or suppress physiological
responses to hypotension.60 Ethanol may also increase absorption
of food allergens through increased intestinal permeability, a
mechanism that may also be relevant to the effects of exercise.
Upright posture has been associated with both fatal food and
fatal venom anaphylaxis, suggesting significant cardiovascular
compromise in both cases.
Other proposed risk factors, although lacking consistent evi-
dence, are race (increased risk in African Americans, and
UK-resident South Asians),6,14 allergy to multiple foods,61,62
exercise,
and
intercurrent
illness.60
Low
serum
platelet-
activating factor acetyl hydrolase activity was associated with
fatal outcome in acute samples analyzed in one study of peanut
allergy.63 However, this finding has not be replicated elsewhere,
and may reflect increased levels of platelet-activating factor
release during severe reactions.
Practical implications of fatal food anaphylaxis data
� Fatal food anaphylaxis is rare, such that it adds little to overall
mortality risk, even in young people known to have food
allergy.
� Reliable identification of patients at increased risk of fatal food
anaphylaxis is not currently possible, but patients with isolated
egg allergy or no asthma appear to be at lowest risk, and risk is
highest in the second and third decades of life.
� Features of food anaphylaxis and its management associated
with fatal outcome are upright posture and delayed use of
epinephrine.
� Given the rarity of fatal food anaphylaxis, our inability to
reliably stratify risk, and the limited evidence that specific
interventions reduce fatality risk—quality of life considerations
should play a key role in driving treatment decisions for people
with food allergy.

 the last decade in most regions where data are available. There
was an overall 12% increase per annum in the United Kingdom
between 1998 and 2012,14 and data from Rochester, Minnesota,
showed a significant 59% increase in emergency department
visits for venom anaphylaxis between 2005 and 2014.64 Overall
insect stings account for 10% to 20% of anaphylaxis in these and
other studies,35,65 but up to 50% in a European registry of severe
anaphylaxis.17 Population rates of fatal insect venom anaphylaxis
in recent studies from 4 geographic regions6,11,12,14 are sum-
marized in Table III. A consistent finding is that fatal insect
venom anaphylaxis occurs at a rate of approximately 0.1 cases per
million population in Australia, Canada (Ontario), United
Kingdom, and United States. Some geographic variation was
noted in the United States, with a higher rate in Southern states,6
something that was not reported for fatal food or drug anaphy-
laxis. Another consistent finding across these studies is the
absence of a significant change in the rate of fatal venom
anaphylaxis over time, despite the increases in emergency
department attendance and hospitalizations noted above. This is
consistent with an earlier report of stable fatal venom anaphylaxis
rates from the 1960s to the 1980s in the United States.66 The
estimated incidence of fatal venom anaphylaxis for an individual
with venom allergy (Fig 2) is low and adds little to overall
mortality risk. However, this risk may be higher for specific
groups, as discussed below. Mullins et al11 reported honeybee to
be the dominant cause of fatal insect venom anaphylaxis,
although this may relate to the relatively high prevalence of al-
lergy to this insect in Australia. Wasps were the commonest cause
of fatal venom anaphylaxis in the United Kingdom,10 and in a
large European registry of nonfatal anaphylaxis.17
Risk factors—venom
Key risk factors from recent studies of fatal venom anaphy-
laxis, including a total of 535 cases, are summarized in Table III.
Consistent findings are that fatal insect venom allergy is a disease
of adult males, with 80% to 90% of cases occurring in men, at an
average age of 50 to 60 years. Two studies reported that only half
of cases occur in people known to have had a prior systemic
allergic reaction to the same insect. This may limit the impact
that venom immunotherapy can have on fatal venom anaphylaxis
rates. White race appears to be a risk factor for fatal venom
anaphylaxis in the United States. In Australia, upright posture
and pre-existing cardiovascular disease were cited as common
features. For anaphylaxis triggered by tick bites, as opposed to
insect venom, squeezing ticks for removal was a common feature.
This has led to Australian recommendations to freeze ticks with
an
ether-containing
spray,
rather
than
remove
them
by
squeezing. Cardiovascular disease is thought to be an important
risk factor for fatal venom anaphylaxis, and consistent with this
postural changes have been reported in fatal cases.14,67
Other cofactors such as exercise, alcohol, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, acute infections, stress, and perimenstrual
status are thought to increase the risk for anaphylaxis and severe
anaphylaxis in general. Little direct evidence for these risk factors
is available in relation to insect venom anaphylaxis, and alcohol
use was not found to be a risk factor in one study.14 Mastocytosis
is associated with nonfatal insect venom anaphylaxis,68 and has
been associated with a specific clinical presentation of hypoten-
sive anaphylaxis in the absence of skin symptoms.69 Although
there is particular interest in the relationship between systemic
mastocytosis and reaction severity, systemic mastocytosis has
only been specifically identified as a risk factor for fatal venom
anaphylaxis in case reports.70 Low platelet-activating factor acetyl
hydrolase has been associated with increased risk,71 but these
data require further validation.
A health economic analysis undertaken for the UK National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence found that a highly
effective treatment for venom allergy, subcutaneous venom
immunotherapy, was only cost effective if quality of life
improvement occurred, or in specific high-risk groups with
frequent stings and frequent reactions, such as beekeepers.72-74
This was due to the rarity of costly outcomes such as death or
disability in patients with known venom allergy. Disability is not
widely reported as an outcome of venom anaphylaxis, but
anecdotal evidence suggests that persistent vegetative state after
hypoxic encephalopathy in near-fatal venom anaphylaxis is a
significant risk, and this may impact on health economic ana-
lyses. The UK health economic analysis does suggest that quality
of life impact is an important factor to consider when making
treatment decisions with venom allergic patients.75
Practical implications of fatal venom anaphylaxis
data
� The risk of fatal venom anaphylaxis for venom allergic in-
dividuals is low, approximately 3 to 6 cases per million person
years.
� Risk factors for fatal venom anaphylaxis are middle age, male
sex, white race, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and
possibly specific immunological disorders such as mastocytosis.
� Fatal venom anaphylaxis is associated with upright posture,
and fatal tick bite anaphylaxis is associated with squeezing ticks
for removal.
� These risk factors should be considered, together with quality
of life impairment, when making treatment decisions in
venom allergic patients.
CONCLUSIONS
We have summarized key clinical indicators of increased risk
for fatal anaphylaxis and highlighted information that might be
used for stratifying risk and making treatment decisions in at-risk
patients. Published reports of fatal anaphylaxis have generally
been obtained from national registers of death certificate data,
and these data are subject to underreporting, miscoding, and
significant discrepancies in coronial notification and subsequent
investigation of suspected fatal anaphylaxis. In some regions,
death from food or insect anaphylaxis may be coded as due to
“natural causes.” In most published datasets, a significant pro-
portion of fatal anaphylaxis cases are classified as “unspecified
cause.” Improved diagnostic codes for anaphylaxis, and the
maintenance of fatal anaphylaxis registries, are important to
ensure data quality. With these caveats in mind, the available
data do suggest that fatal anaphylaxis is a very rare event, and
although fatal drug anaphylaxis may be increasing, data do not
consistently support a change in incidence of fatal food or venom
anaphylaxis in recent years. This may in part be due to improved
delivery of emergency medical care and increased availability of
epinephrine autoinjectors limiting any potential increase in
anaphylaxis fatalities.14 Risk factors for fatal anaphylaxis are
mainly cause-specific, although increased age and cardiovascular
comorbidity are common risk factors for fatal venom and drug
anaphylaxis, and upright posture during anaphylaxis is a feature

improving our ability to identify those at risk and prevent fatal
anaphylaxis, amongst populations with known allergy to drugs,
food, and venom.
