Avoidable Mortality: The Core of the 
Global Cancer Divide
INTRODUCTION
Suffering and death as a result of cancer dispro-
portionately affect the poor. This glaring, unac-
ceptable difference between wealthy and poorer 
countries is the cancer divide. Shrouded in the 
myth that cancer is a disease of the wealthy, the 
divide remains understudied, underprioritized, 
and undertreated.1 Of the 8.7 million global 
cancer deaths in 2015, more than two-thirds 
occurred in low- and middle-income countries 
(LMICs).2 Lethality, approximated by mortality/
incidence in any given year, is highest in low- 
income countries for almost all cancers that 
 
are screening-detectable or treatable.1,3 Although 
the incidence of infection-associated cancers 
is inversely associated with income, the oppor-
tunity to survive cancers that are amenable to 
treatment is closely correlated with the income 
of a country. In 2012, a child living in one of the 
25 poorest countries of the world diagnosed with 
leukemia had approximately a 10% chance of 
survival, whereas in Canada the figure was close 
to 90%.4
An increasing body of evidence shows that a sig-
nificant proportion of the cancer burden, espe-
cially in LMICs, could be avoided by reducing 
exposure to risk factors and increasing access 
to screening for early detection and treatment.1,3 
However, the necessary public health and medi-
cal interventions are much less accessible to the 
poor, which largely explains the disparate mortal-
ity rates between and within population groups.
Our analysis unveils one aspect of the enigma 
of the cancer divide: avoidable mortality across 
country income groups. We present estimates of 
premature cancer mortality using data for 20152 
and comparing low, lower-middle, upper-middle, 
 
and high-income countries. We apply the con-
cept of avoidable mortality, which refers to 
premature deaths that, given current medical 
knowledge and technology, could be avoided by 
a health system through either prevention and/or 
Purpose The incidence of infection-associated cancers and lethality of cancers amenable to 
treatment are closely correlated with the income of countries. We analyzed a core part of this 
global cancer divide—the distribution of premature mortality across country income groups and 
 
cancers—applying novel approaches to measure avoidable mortality and identify priorities for 
public policy.
Methods We analyzed avoidable cancer mortality using set lower- and upper-bound age limits of 
65 and 75 years (empirical approach), applying cancer-specific and country income group–specific 
ages of death (feasibility approach), and applying cancer-specific ages of death of high-income 
countries to all low- and middle-income countries (LMICs; social justice approach). We applied 
these methods to 2015 mortality data on 16 cancers for which prevention is possible and/or treat-
ment is likely to result in cure or significant increase in life expectancy.
Results At least 30% and as much as 50% of cancer deaths are premature, corresponding to be-
tween 2.6 and 4.3 million deaths each year, and 70% to 80% are concentrated in LMICs. Using 
the feasibility approach, 36% of cancer deaths are avoidable; with the social justice approach, 
45% of cancer deaths are avoidable. Five cancer types—breast, colorectal, lung, liver, and 
stomach—account for almost 75% of avoidable cancer deaths in LMICs and worldwide.
Conclusion Each year, millions of premature cancer deaths could be avoided with interventions 
focused on four priority areas: infection-associated cancers, lifestyle and risk factors, women’s 
cancers, and children’s cancers. Our analysis of the global burden and the specific cancer types 
associated with avoidable cancer mortality suggests significant opportunities for health systems 
to redress the inequity of the global cancer divide.

 treatment and should not occur in the presence 
of effective and timely health care.5-7
We identify 16 types of cancer for which preven-
tion and/or treatment would likely result in a cure 
or a significant increase in life expectancy and 
analyze the avoidable mortality associated with 
each using three distinct conceptual and empir-
ical approaches: specific age cutoffs; assuming 
that any country should be able to have the same 
cancer-specific median ages of death as other 
countries in a group that faces similar economic 
conditions; and applying the cancer-specific 
median ages of death of high-income countries 
to all country income groups, assuming that 
poorer countries should be able to expect the 
same outcomes as those of rich countries.
The WHO Global Action Plan for the preven-
tion and control of noncommunicable diseases 
(NCDs) 2013- 2020, is specifically aimed at 
reducing premature mortality from NCDs, includ-
ing cancer, by 25% by 2025.8 Our analysis con-
tributes to this global effort by highlighting the 
large proportion of cancer mortality that should 
be considered avoidable, measuring the con-
centration of these deaths in LMICs, and iden-
tifying high-priority cancer types that could 
 
be targets for health system and other policy 
interventions and innovations.
METHODS
Analysis of avoidable mortality assumes a goal 
for life expectancy of a population and identi-
fies all deaths from a specific cause that occur 
before that age. The term avoidable mortal-
ity originates from efforts to benchmark quality 
 
of care through the measurement of unnec-
essary, untimely deaths.5 Initial empirical anal-
ysis at the population level was conducted to 
assess mortality differences in England and 
Wales and first introduced the terms “avoidable 
mortality” and ailments “amenable to medical 
 
intervention.”9(p691)
Traditional methodologies, like that of WHO,10 use 
specific age cutoffs, and because of increased 
global life expectancy, the age at which point 
a death is no longer avoidable tends to shift 
upward over time. Until recently, the majority 
of literature on avoidable mortality had typically 
established premature death using an age limit 
of 65 years.11-15 As life expectancy increased, 
the choice of an upper limit of 65 years was no 
longer justified, and some studies began setting 
an age limit of 75 years, more closely aligned 
with life expectancy in developed countries.16,17 
More innovative approaches include the frontier 
country methodology that is based on the lowest 
risk of mortality for each sex-age group across 
countries.18
Our methods build off work by Knaul et al,1 which 
described two additional conceptual approaches 
beyond that of a 65-year empirical cutoff: a fea-
sibility approach, which used the median age 
of death in the best-performing country of each 
income group (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, 
and high) for each cancer as the threshold; and 
a social justice approach that used an empirical 
cutoff of 75 years, which is close to the mean age 
of death observed in high-income countries, and 
considers that poor countries should hold the 
same standard as rich countries. Here, we refine 
and expand on these conceptual approaches 
to analyze avoidable mortality associated with 
16 cancer types across country income groups, 
using 2015 Institute for Health Metrics and Eval-
uation cancer mortality data2 and 2015 World 
Bank country income classifications.19
Our selection of cancer types is based on earlier 
research,6,11-15 focusing specifically on those for 
which prevention and/or treatment would likely 
result in a cure or a significant increase in life 
expectancy. The cancer types considered in 
our analysis are: bladder, breast, cervix-uteri, 
colorectal, corpus uteri (endometrial), Hodgkin 
lymphoma, leukemia (in children), lip and oral 
cavity (including larynx), liver, lung (including 
 
trachea and bronchus), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 
prostate, skin melanoma (malignant), stomach, 
testicular, and thyroid.
For a cancer death to be considered avoidable it 
must have occurred prematurely, as defined in 
Equation 1:
 
 
AM 
ij = ∑ 
k  
= 
0
 
 
n
 D 
k 
 
(1)
where AMij is the avoidable mortality associated 
with cancer type i in country j; Dk is the number of 
deaths in age stratum k; and n, for each scenario, 
is the age limit from which a death is considered 
potentially avoidable with appropriate prevention 
and treatment interventions in place. We applied 
three different conceptual approaches to estab-
lish the age limit below which a cancer death 
could be considered avoidable.

 Empirical Approach
Under this scenario, a death is considered 
avoidable if the age at which the death occurred 
is younger than 65 years, a lower-bound thresh-
old on life expectancy and a minimum cutoff for 
countries to achieve. An exception to this rule is 
death as a result of leukemia, for which the age 
limit in the literature is usually 45 years.20-22 This 
approach follows the majority of the literature 
and also happens to be the approximate global 
median age of death in our data across the 15 
cancers (all excluding leukemia) (Table 1).11-15 
In this scenario, n = 64 years in Equation 1.
The empirical approach considers an age limit 
of 75 years as an upper-bound threshold that is 
close to overall life expectancy levels observed 
 
in high-income countries. Although some top- 
performing countries have average life expec-
tancies longer than 75 years, disaggregated 
cancer mortality data above age 75 years are 
largely unavailable, and this cutoff has also 
been used widely in the literature.2,16,17 In this 
scenario, n = 74 years in Equation 1.
Feasibility Approach
The feasibility approach goes beyond the con-
cept of a singular cutoff and applies the median 
age of death for each of the cancers in each of 
the four country income groups as the threshold 
for what can be achieved, thereby establishing 
64 separate cancer- and income group–specific 
age limits (Table 1). This approach assumes that 
any country should be able to do as well as other 
countries in a group that faces similar economic 
challenges and restrictions.
Thus, Equation 1 becomes modified as follows 
(Equation 2):
 
 
A 
M 
ijl =  
∑ 
k  
= 
0
 
 
 
n
 
l
 
  
D 
k 
(2)
where l corresponds to the income group and 
 
takes the values of low, lower-middle, upper- 
middle, or high. The previous n changes to nl 
and corresponds to the age limit from which a 
death is considered potentially avoidable with 
appropriate prevention and treatment interven-
tions in place in income group l.
Social Justice Approach
The social justice approach applies the median 
age of death of high-income countries for each 
of the 16 cancer types as the standard expec-
tancy of age of death to be applied worldwide. 
This approach focuses on the achievable life 
expectancy on the basis of the wealthiest coun-
tries in the world and reflects the view that 
residents of poorer countries should be able 
to expect the same outcomes as those of rich 
countries and that, on average, people living 
with cancer in wealthier countries have higher 
life expectancies. This approach is centered on 
the principle of fairness, particularly on ensur-
ing equitable health capabilities for all, both the 
opportunity and process freedoms to achieve 
better health.23,24 In this scenario, nl in Equation 2 
 
corresponds to the median age of death in 
high-income countries.
Each of these approaches was applied to each 
country’s mortality data and age at death by 
cancer type from the Institute for Health Metrics 
and Evaluation 2015 Mortality Database.2 Total 
mortality estimates for each cancer type are pre-
sented by income group (Table 2).
RESULTS
Using the empirical approach with a threshold 
of 65 years, approximately 30% (2.6 million) 
of the 8.7 million global deaths from cancer in 
2015 are considered avoidable, of which > 80% 
occurred in LMICs. Using the most demanding 
threshold of 75 years, approximately half (4.3 
million) of the 8.7 million global deaths from 
cancer in 2015 could be avoided, > 76% of 
which occurred in LMICs (Table 3).
Applying the feasibility approach, approximately 
36% (almost 3.1 million) of the 8.7 million global 
cancer deaths in 2015 are considered avoid-
able. The burden of avoidable cancer mortality 
still falls largely on the poor, as > 71% of global 
avoidable cancer deaths occurred in LMICs.
Results from the social justice approach suggest 
that in an idealized scenario, where residents 
of poor countries are able to expect the same 
outcomes as those of rich countries currently, 
up to 45% of all global cancer deaths could be 
avoided, and > 77% occur in LMICs. This means 
that nearly 3.9 million deaths could be avoided 
if the highest standards of medical interventions, 
programs, and known efficient health policies

 were made available to all populations at a global 
level.
We next consider cancer-specific global avoid-
able mortality as a proportion of total deaths 
from each specific cancer type (Table 4). Under 
both the feasibility approach and social justice 
approach scenarios, the five cancer types with 
the highest proportions of avoidable mortality 
globally are testicular, liver, corpus-uteri, cervix- 
uteri, and breast. Irrespective of the approach 
used, breast, cervix-uteri, liver, and testicular 
cancers rank among the top five.
Overall, the empirical approach lower and upper 
bounds of 65 and 75 years suggest that between 
40% and 67% of global deaths from these 16 
cancer types are avoidable. Under the social jus-
tice approach scenario, 58% of all global deaths 
from these 16 cancers are considered avoid-
able. Considering the economic context and 
restrictions of each income group separately, the 
feasibility approach, which we consider the most 
realistic scenario for all countries, still suggests 
that nearly 47% of global deaths from these 16 
cancer types are avoidable.
We use this feasibility approach to show can-
cer-specific avoidable mortality by income group 
and globally (Table 5). Globally, lung cancer 
is the leading cause of avoidable mortality, 
accounting for one in four avoidable cancer 
deaths. Five cancers (lung, liver, stomach, col-
orectal, and breast) account for almost 75% of 
all avoidable cancer deaths in LMICs overall and 
worldwide.
DISCUSSION
Building off previous work,1 we used three dif-
ferent conceptual approaches for estimating 
avoidable mortality and applied these to a sub-
set of cancers that can be prevented or treated 
successfully in low-resource settings using cur-
rent knowledge and medical advances. Our esti-
mates suggest that there are between 2.6 and 
4.3 million deaths from cancer each year that 
could be avoided with effective prevention and 
treatment. LMICs account for the majority (70% 
to 80%) of this avoidable cancer mortality.
Using both the empirical and social justice 
approaches results in a clear gradient from low- 
to high-income countries in the proportion of 
cancer deaths that can be considered avoidable. 
A much larger proportion of deaths in LMICs 
could be prevented; avoidable mortality as a pro-
portion of total cancer deaths is 1.5 to two times 
higher in low-income countries compared with 
high-income countries. Many of these deaths 
are from infection-associated cancers. Variation

 is lower using the feasibility approach, and lev-
els of avoidable mortality are uniformly high 
 
at 33%, 35%, 38%, and 32% in low, lower- 
middle, upper-middle, and high-income coun-
tries, respectively. This reveals that even in 
high-income countries, a considerable propor-
tion of deaths from cancer could potentially be 
avoided with universal access to prevention 
and/or treatment.
Even with severe resource constraints, a well- 
conceived and well-managed national cancer 
program, spanning the cancer continuum from 
prevention to treatment to palliation, can reduce 
avoidable cancer mortality and improve the 
lives of patients with cancer. Understanding 
 
the causes and determinants of avoidable can-
cer mortality has important implications for 
targeting health policy to those cancers with 
particularly high avoidable mortality rates and 
for which cancer-specific interventions should 
be promoted and prioritized in health financing 
and social insurance. The evidence can assist 
countries in identifying both cancers that affect 
large proportions of the population (eg, lung) 
and others that affect smaller numbers of peo-
ple but are highly treatable or preventable (eg, 
testicular). In some countries, health reform and 
universal health coverage initiatives have been 
designed using evidence on avoidable cancer 
mortality balanced with concerns for equity and 
feasibility.25,
Although income and geography should not 
determine the probability of dying as a result of a 
disease, in reality they do. LMICs suffer a larger 
share of global mortality, as compared with 
global incidence, for almost all cancers that are 
screening-detectable or treatable.1 As science 
and innovation uncover new methods for early 
detection, treatment, and cure, the suffering 
and death as a result of these cancers becomes 
increasingly concentrated among the poor.
Our findings reveal four key areas that should 
be prioritized by LMICs, for which significant 
opportunities exist for health sector policies, pro-
grams, and quality medical interventions. These 
are: controlling risk factors, infection-associated 
cancers, women’s cancers, and pediatric and 
adolescent cancers.
Our results for middle- and high-income coun-
tries show highest avoidable mortality pro-
portions for lung, breast, colorectal, liver, and 
stomach cancers, revealing a persistent need

 to address behavioral risk factors and expand 
access to screening and early detection. These 
interventions coincide with the best buys that 
have been highlighted by the WHO.26
Cancers associated with infection account for 
almost 25% of all cancers27,28 and dispropor-
tionately affect poor populations. Our results 
show that the cancers that comprise the larg-
est proportion of all avoidable cancer deaths in 
low-income countries are liver, stomach, and 
cervix-uteri cancers. Access to low-cost inter-
ventions for primary prevention through vacci-
nation against human papillomavirus or hepatitis 
B, as well as increasingly low-cost screening, 
early detection, and treatment of certain infec-
tions, should be expanded as part of universal 
health coverage, with a focus on poor population 
groups. These cancers are concentrated among 
the poor in middle- and high-income countries, 
and prevention and early detection should be a 
high, targeted priority.29
Our results from both the feasibility and social 
justice approaches reveal the five cancer types 
with the highest proportions of avoidable mortal-
ity globally, in rank order: testicular, liver, corpus- 
uteri, cervix-uteri, and breast. Three of these 
five cancers are almost exclusively endured by 
women, a reality that exacerbates sex inequality 
worldwide. Furthermore, these cancers tend to 
affect young women in their reproductive and 
productive years, accounting for a large number 
of healthy years of life lost and affecting entire 
families.30-32 This presents a key opportunity for 
LMICs to integrate early detection programs for 
women’s cancers into existing health and devel-
opment initiatives, including maternal and child 
health, sexual and reproductive health, HIV/
AIDS programs, and antipoverty platforms.1
LMICs stand to benefit significantly from policies 
that address childhood and adolescent can-
cers, like leukemia. These cancers account for 
a high number of potential years of healthy life 
lost and are important targets for national can-
cer planning. Furthermore, the cancer divide is 
 
most pronounced for children, with high mortality- 
to-incidence ratios in the poorest countries of 
the world and low ratios in the United States, 
Canada, and Western Europe due to access to 
treatment.
Our research has several limitations that point 
to opportunities for future work. Our calculations 
provide point-in-time estimates of avoidable 
mortality for 2015 but do not speak to future 
trends. Although our estimates are likely to effec-
tively capture the potential to reduce the impact 
of infection-associated cancers for which rates of 
incidence and mortality are high in lower-income 
countries and low in high-income countries (eg, 
cervical cancer), they will likely understate the 
potential to reduce the burden of cancers that 
are currently of low incidence in LMICs. For dis-
eases such as breast cancer, where prevention 
is difficult and for which incidence is expected 
to increase as countries undergo epidemiologic 
and demographic transitions, our methodology 
will underestimate the associated avoidable mor-
tality. Additional research should be undertaken 
to project the stream of future avoidable mor-
tality, accounting for these transitions. In addi-
tion, in countries with a high burden of HIV and 
cancer comorbidity, the cancer-specific age at 
death would be lower, and future analysis should 
consider comorbidities. Furthermore, our esti-
mates are based on overall mortality estimates 
for all ages, and future research should rep-
licate the analysis specifically for children and 
by sex. Results should also be disaggregated by 
geographic region, and country-specific results 
should be analyzed where national cancer reg-
istries exist to identify country-specific priorities.
Each year millions of premature cancer deaths 
could be avoided with low-cost interventions 
focused on reducing risk factors, promoting 
screening and early detection, and providing 
access to basic treatment. Despite vast inequi-
ties in access to cancer medicines, vaccines, 
and technologies, effective low-cost treatment, 
financial protection programs, and innovative 
care delivery models exist and can be applied to 
resource-constrained settings to reduce avoid-
able cancer mortality worldwide.1,33,34 The results 
presented herein can facilitate the design of 
national cancer control plans and strategies to 
expand access that should be rooted in a com-
prehensive care continuum from public health 
prevention strategies, to screening and early 
detection interventions linked to accessible and 
quality treatment, to palliative care required to 
relieve the pain and suffering associated with all 
cancers.1,35
