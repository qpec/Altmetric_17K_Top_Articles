Abstract
Background: A prolonged and complicated second stage of labour is associated with serious perinatal
complications. The Odon device is an innovation intended to perform instrumental vaginal delivery presently under
development. We present an evaluation of the feasibility and safety of delivery with early prototypes of this device
from an early terminated clinical study.
Methods: Hospital-based, multi-phased, open-label, pilot clinical study with no control group in tertiary hospitals in
Argentina and South Africa. Multiparous and nulliparous women, with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies, were
enrolled during the third trimester of pregnancy. Delivery with Odon device was attempted under non-emergency
conditions during the second stage of labour. The feasibility outcome was delivery with the Odon device defined
as successful expulsion of the fetal head after one-time application of the device.
Results: Of the 49 women enrolled, the Odon device was inserted successfully in 46 (93%), and successful Odon
device delivery as defined above was achieved in 35 (71%) women. Vaginal, first and second degree perineal tears
occurred in 29 (59%) women. Four women had cervical tears. No third or fourth degree perineal tears were
observed. All neonates were born alive and vigorous. No adverse maternal or infant outcomes were observed at
6-weeks follow-up for all dyads, and at 1 year for the first 30 dyads.
Conclusions: Delivery using the Odon device is feasible. Observed genital tears could be due to the device or the
process of delivery and assessment bias. Evaluating the effectiveness and safety of the further developed prototype
of the BD Odon Device™ will require a randomized-controlled trial.

 Plain English summary
The Odon device is an innovation, presently under de-
velopment, intended to assist vaginal birth when second
stage takes longer than what is considered safe or if
complications arose (e.g. baby is large or distressed). The
objective of the study was to find out whether this new
device helps pushing out of the baby through the birth
canal. The study included women at their first delivery
and women who delivered before, with uncomplicated
pregnancies and one fetus in two hospitals in Argentina
and South Africa. Delivery with the Odon device was
attempted in women undergoing normal, uncomplicated
labour. The Odon device was inserted successfully in 46
of the 49 women included (93%), and successful delivery
with expulsion of the fetal head after one-time applica-
tion of the Odon device was achieved in 35 (71%)
women. Genital tears occurred in 29 (59%) women. As
the use in humans has been limited, increased risk of
tears and other unknown risks cannot be ruled out. Four
women had cervical tears but no women had severe
perineal trauma. All babies were born alive and vigorous.
No adverse maternal or infant outcomes were observed
at 6-weeks follow-up, and at 1 year for the first 30
mothers and babies. Delivery using the Odon device is
feasible. These findings suggest continuing evaluating
the effectiveness and safety of new prototypes of the BD
Odon Device™ in a clinical comparative trial with a
standard device before introduction in clinical practice.
Background
Prolonged or complicated second stage of labour is asso-
ciated with potentially serious maternal complications
and deaths as well as stillbirths and neonatal morbidity
and mortality [1].
Currently, the main options for managing prolonged/
complicated second stage of labour are instrumental va-
ginal delivery (IVD) with forceps or vacuum extractor,
and caesarean section. IVD is one of the six critical func-
tions of basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care [2],
but currently under-used, particularly in low-resource
settings where rates are as low as 1-5% [3, 4]. In high-
resource settings, IVD rates tend to be higher (up to
15%) [5, 6], but declining rates have been reported in
several countries [4]. These trends are inversely corre-
lated with the increasing rates of caesarean sections
worldwide [7].
There are multiple factors associated with low or de-
clining use of IVD. None of the available instruments
are without risk for the mother or the baby. While use
of forceps is associated with increased maternal perineal
trauma, need for analgesia and neonatal facial injury,
cephalhaematoma and subgaleal haemorrhage are asso-
ciated with vacuum birth [8]. Failure rates are also re-
ported to be relatively high, particularly with the use of
vacuum extractor at around 20% [8]. An additional bar-
rier is the high level of skill and continuous training re-
quired to perform safe and effective IVD [9, 10]. This
limits the use of IVD if birth attendants are not provided
with sufficient resources to obtain and maintain the ne-
cessary skills.
The design and development of innovative IVD instru-
ments that are safe for mothers and babies, easy for
different cadres of skilled birth attendants to use, cost-
effective, and affordable in low resource settings is a
priority [11]. In this sense, the Odon device is a techno-
logical innovation intended to fulfil this gap, by improv-
ing outcomes associated with prolonged or complicated
second stage of labour and reduce the skill level and
equipment
required
to
perform
assisted
vaginal
deliveries.
We present results of an early terminated study de-
signed to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary safety
of delivery with early prototypes of the Odon device in
singleton
term
pregnancies
under
non-emergency
conditions.
Methods
Study design and participants
This was a hospital-based, multi-phased, open-label, med-
ical device pilot clinical study without control group. The
study methods were described in detail elsewhere [12].
The design of the study in phases included an evalu-
ation of the first five multiparous women, the next 25
multiparous with 1 year follow-up, and then the inclu-
sion of both multiparous and nulliparous women until
completion of the sample size. Therefore, women were
enrolled in three phases: 1) multiparous women with a
previously successful spontaneous vaginal delivery with
1 year follow up (2011-2012); 2) multiparous and
nulliparous with 6-weeks follow up (2014-2015) at a pri-
vate not-for-profit tertiary hospital in Buenos Aires,
Argentina. In 2013, Becton Dickinson and Company
(BD) licensed the development rights of the Odon de-
vice. In consequence, the trial was paused in January
2015 for BD to conduct preclinical studies [13–15] and
develop a new prototype. 3) The third phase included
multiparous and nulliparous women with follow-up until
discharge at a public tertiary hospital in Pretoria, South
Africa (2017). The new BD Odon device was planned to
be applied in additional women at public hospitals in
Argentina (2 hospitals), Kenya (1) and South Africa (4)
for completion of the sample size, before the study was
prematurely terminated. After the 49th case, the com-
pany decided to end this pilot study in favour of a ran-
domized pivotal clinical trial to be conducted in Europe
and India.
Women were invited to participate if they were be-
tween 18 and 35 years old, had no pre-existing health

 conditions and uncomplicated singleton pregnancies in
the third trimester in Argentina or while in the hospital
admitted for induction of labour in South Africa.
Written informed consent was obtained before labour
during antenatal care in Argentina or at the hospital after
admission for childbirth in South Africa. Women were
eligible for application of the Odon device during the
second stage if the following conditions were met:
� fetus was alive and had a normal fetal heart rate as
assessed by continuous electronic fetal monitoring;
� fully dilated cervix;
� ruptured membranes;
� any anterior occiput position;
� station level equivalent to 2 cm or more below the
spines (station + 2 or lower).
Women were excluded if they did not confirm consent
to participate in the study verbally before application of
the device, or if any maternal or fetal complication arose
during labour.
All women and their infants were followed until dis-
charge and at 6-weeks postpartum. The first 30 mother/in-
fant dyads recruited were also followed up to one year, as
per protocol. No mother/infant dyad was lost to follow-up.
All the applications of the device were supervised, and
assisted as required, by another obstetrician trained in
the use of the device. A training plan for obstetricians
applying the device was developed for implementation
of the last phase of the study.
The Department of Reproductive Health and Research
from the World Health Organization (WHO) was the
sponsor and performed overall coordination of the
study. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and
an expert committee independently reviewed the study
progress and all cases. Based on these assessments, the
study governing bodies supported continuing the series
of studies necessary to evaluate feasibility, effectiveness
and safety of the new BD Odon Device.
The study was approved by the WHO Research Ethics
Review Committee; the Ethics Committee in Research of
CEMIC and the National Drugs, Food, and Technology
Administration of Argentina (ANMAT) in Argentina;
and the The Research Ethics Committee, Faculty Health
Sciences, University of Pretoria and the Medicines Con-
trol Council in South Africa. This study was registered
in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
(registration number ACTRN12613000141741).
Intervention - the Odon device
The Odon Device (Fig. 1) is made of two main compo-
nents: a plastic sleeve and an inserter (or applicator).
The sleeve is made of flexible polyethylene, with an in-
ternal fold in contact with the fetal head and the
external fold in contact with the vaginal wall. The sleeve
contains an air chamber (cuff) that is inflated around
the fetal head by a manually operated bulb pump. The
inserter consists of a handle with four pronged flexible
spatulas that slide around the fetal head and help to pos-
ition the sleeve. A plastic cup (plastic bell) at the tip of
the inserter facilitates the application and protects the
fetal head. The inserter has a progress indicator allowing
the operator to check when the correct depth of inser-
tion has been reached. The application technique of the
Odon device is described in Fig. 2.
The devices used in Argentina were manufactured,
and assembled by MDV (Muller, Dordoni, Visani) Srl in
Buenos Aires, Argentina. The device used in South
Africa was manufactured by BD in Singapore. During
the study, design modifications, both to the inserter and
the plastic sleeve, were introduced to improve usability,
facilitate insertion and avoid loss of air pressure in the air
cuff. Four slightly different prototypes of the device were
used in Argentina. Device modifications were evaluated by
the study DSMB and the Odon Device Research Group.
These groups conferred that the modifications introduced
potentially improved safety and usability and did not inter-
fere with interpretation of the study results.
Outcome measures
The list of safety and feasibility outcomes is available
elsewhere [12]. Feasibility was assessed as successful ap-
plication of the device defined as (1) reaching number 4
or 5 in the reading window of the inserter (Fig. 2,
image 3), (2) successful inflation of the device without
air leaks after the expulsion, and (3) successful expulsion
of the fetal head with the plastic sleeve around the head
(Fig. 2, image 5) after one-time application of the Odon
device. Cases in which the plastic sleeve detached at the
moment of crowning were reported as “crowning with

 Odon”. Insertion refers to the introduction and with-
drawal of the inserter (Fig. 2, images 1 to 4).
Maternal and neonatal safety was assessed at labour, de-
livery and before discharge. Vaginal and cervical lacera-
tions were evaluated by a systematic exploration of the
birth canal and uterine cervix using vaginal spatulas after
delivery. For the first 48 women/infant dyads the following
safety outcomes were assessed at 6-weeks: perineal or va-
ginal haematoma, postpartum haemorrhage, infection,
fever, blood transfusion, maternal or infant re-admission
to hospital. For the first 30 dyads the following outcomes
were assessed at the one-year follow-up: urinary incontin-
ence, faecal/flat incontinence, perineal pain, dyspareunia,
infant developmental impairment (assessed through ma-
ternal interview, contact with the paediatrician and review
of medical record) and death.

 and 20% (13.5%-27.9%) with a 95% confidence interval
width not larger than 15%. Details are published else-
where [12]. The current study was terminated early in
June 2017 in favour of a comparative trial. At that time,
48 women were recruited in Argentina and one woman
in South Africa and results are presented in this
manuscript.
Statistical analysis
This is a descriptive analysis and no statistical inferences
were done. Continuous variables are reported in means
and ranges; categorical variables in percentages, with
exact binomial 95% confidence intervals (CI) computed
for successful application of the device and genital lacer-
ations in the total sample.
Results
Ninety women were invited to participate in the study
during three study periods: between February 2011 and
September 2012, March 2014 and January 2015, and
May-June 2017. Exclusions included two women who
did not fulfil eligibility criteria, 20 who did not provide
written informed consent, and nine who were group B
streptococcus (GBS) positive. At labour, one woman pre-
sented arrest of labour progress, one prolonged rupture
of membranes, five had fetal complications and labour
progressed too fast in one woman. Additionally, two
women were excluded because their labours occurred
during a study pause in recruitment in March 2014.
Forty-nine women were recruited, 30 multiparous
women in the first phase, 18 in the second phase and
one nulliparous woman in the third phase.
Characteristics of the women
Table 1 shows selected characteristics of the women at
the time of labour and delivery. The average maternal
age was 31 years. The onset of labour was spontaneous
in 40 cases and induced in eight. Augmentation of
labour, with oxytocin or artificial rupture of membranes,
was performed in 47 women. In Argentina, all women
were under epidural anaesthesia.
Feasibility outcomes
Table 2 shows feasibility and safety outcomes in all
women and by parity. The Odon device was successfully
inserted in all women but three. The insertion process
took on average 1 min and 27 s, with 34/49 of the inser-
tions taking less than 1 min and 30 s (data not shown).
Thirty-five out of 49 delivered successfully with the
Odon device (71%, 95% CI 57-83%), with similar rates
between
nulliparous
and
multiparous
women.
In
Argentina,
successful
Odon
device
deliveries
was
achieved more frequently with the improved and more
advanced prototypes (22/27, 81%) than with the earlier
ones (13/21, 61%) (data not shown).
There were 14 non-successful applications according
to the study predefined criteria. Two of failed insertions
mentioned above were due to difficulties in positioning
the device spatulas using the first prototype of the de-
vice, and the case in South Africa. The device slipped off
in nine of the remaining cases and broke off (handle de-
tached from the sleeve during traction) in two cases.
Eleven of those women had a spontaneous delivery, and
three had a forceps (two for maternal fatigue and one
for fetal bradycardia).
Maternal and infant outcomes
After delivery, perineal or vaginal tears were ob-
served in two-thirds of the women (29/49, 59%, 95%
CI 44-73%) (Table 3). Most of the tears occurred in
nulliparous and were vaginal. There were no third or
fourth degree perineal tears. Overall, 28 women received
sutures. All four cervical tears occurred in the lateral sides
of the cervix. One showed mild bleeding and all four were
sutured following the local protocol. No other adverse ma-
ternal outcomes were reported.
Before discharge from hospital, no serious maternal or
neonatal adverse outcomes were reported. Two women
received antibiotic treatment for foul smelling lochia
with no fever, and one for urinary tract infection. One
woman had hypoesthesia of the anterior region of the

repairs healed normally. Two neonates were admitted to
the neonatal intensive care unit for less than 7 days with
respiratory distress for causes that were thought unre-
lated to the device. No other neonatal complications
(jaundice, infection, and need of phototherapy, fetal or
neonatal death) were reported.
No adverse outcomes were recorded in the six-week or
one-year follow-up visits (for the first 30 women/infant
dyads only). No unexpected adverse events were reported.
No substantial differences were observed in safety out-
comes among the five prototypes used (data not shown).
Discussion
We evaluated feasibility and preliminary safety of appli-
cation of the Odon device in 49 women with non-
prolonged/non-complicated second stage of labour. The
device was successfully inserted in 46 women, and suc-
cessful delivery with the device was achieved in close to
three-fourths of the women. Two-thirds of the women
had vaginal, cervical or first/second degree perineal
tears, but no third or fourth degree perineal tears were
observed. No long-term maternal or neonatal adverse
outcomes were observed.
Often new devices and procedures are introduced in
medical practice without having been properly evaluated
[16, 17], failing to provide adequate protection to pa-
tients and sufficient evidence on safety and to health
care providers. However, the design of medical device
studies
requires
specific
approaches
[18,
19].
This
study was designed in phases to ensure safety by a peri-
odic assessment of short- and long-term (one year) out-
comes by an independent DSMB. For example, the
design of the study included an evaluation of the first
five cases and at one-year after delivery of the first 30
cases. As per protocol, upon conclusion of this follow-
up period no further cases were recruited. This approach
ensured that participants were not exposed to unneces-
sary risks and was also in line with requirements of the
ethics committees. The design of the study in phases

 also allowed for introduction of modifications of the de-
vice during the study. The study DSMB and the Odon
Device Research Group conferred that the modifications
introduced potentially improved safety and usability and
did not interfere with interpretation of the study results,
as the principles of operation of the device did not
change. While this is common in feasibility studies of
new devices, and recognised by regulatory bodies [18],
we acknowledge this may limit the interpretation of the
results as a whole. Although the groups are small, no
substantial differences were seen in terms of safety out-
comes across the different prototypes used.
This study has several limitations. The study was car-
ried out mainly at one hospital, and the majority of ap-
plications were performed by only two operators. If this
facilitated acquisition of skills by the operators, feasibil-
ity still needs to be assessed with a larger number of op-
erators and in different contexts. It was not possible to
evaluate the level of discomfort and pain during applica-
tion of the device, as all 48 enrolled women in Argentina
were under epidural anaesthesia. It was planned to col-
lect information on operator’s impressions of use during
application of the device in the last phase of the study.
However, this was not possible due to the early termin-
ation of the study. After the 49th case, the company de-
cided to end this pilot study in favour of a randomized
pivotal clinical study to be conducted in Europe and
India. Ethical issues and consequences of premature dis-
continuation of studies have been extensively discussed
in the literature [20–22].
It is difficult to compare the rates of vaginal/perineal
tears in this study. While the overall rate of tears in the
study (59%, n = 29/49) is comparable to rates associated
with the hand held vacuum used in indicated cases: 45%
of first or second degree tears; 68% of episiotomies; and
6% of third or fourth degree tears [8], which is the
current available instrument associated with the lowest
rate of perineal trauma. We acknowledge that the popu-
lation in this study included women undergoing normal
second stage of labour, while studies on the hand held
vacuum [8] included a substantial proportion of women
with prolonged second stage. Intact perineum in our
sample compares to the 21 to 35% reported in the litera-
ture among low risk women (term, singleton, vertex

 presentation) [23]. It is notable that no intermediate or
long-term adverse outcomes related to perineal trauma
(e.g. perineal pain, incontinence, dyspareunia) were re-
ported at the 6 week or 1 year follow-up.
We have observed four cervical tears in the lateral side
of the cervix. The rate of clinically significant cervical tears
after vaginal birth has been reported between 0.2 to 4.8%
in different retrospective studies [24–27]. However, stud-
ies using routine colposcopy in consecutive cases of vagi-
nal deliveries found much higher rates of any cervical
injury, including erosion (79%), laceration (23% to 56%)
and bruising (30%) without clinical signs [28–30]. One ex-
planation of our findings is that the spatulas of the inserter
may have caused harm by direct contact with the cervix.
However, it is unlikely to be the only explanation, particu-
larly with a fully dilated and effaced cervix and a fetus at
station + 2 or lower. These findings may also be explained
by observation bias. The fact that all women had a thor-
ough vaginal examination may have prompted the diagno-
sis of an event that is underdiagnosed and underreported
in routine practice [24].
At this stage, the increased risk of tears and other un-
known risks cannot be ruled out. Also, it is not possible
to know if women with indication for IVD could present
higher rates of genital tears with Odon device compared
to other instruments. Therefore, a fair assessment of the
failures and complications commonly, such as birth
canal tears, associated with IVD is not possible until a
direct comparison between the Odon device and other
existing instruments is conducted in a randomised clin-
ical trial in the intended population. Further research is
supported by results of preclinical studies showing that
the Odon device was not associated with more perineal
distension compared to forceps or vacuum [15]. Further
improvements in the design of the device might also in-
crease successful application in future research [31].
Conclusions
Our results suggest that delivery using the Odon device is
feasible. However, observed genital tears could be due to
the device or the process of delivery and assessment bias.
If proof of concept has been demonstrated, effectiveness
and safety of the device remains to be assessed in a rando-
mised trial, as the device in this study was applied under
non-emergency conditions, in women with normal pro-
gress of labour and no indication of IVD. Efficacy, safety
and feasibility remain also to be assessed in different
facility-settings and countries. A regular risk-benefit assess-
ment will be needed in order to mitigate risks arising from
this kind of study, and clear stopping rules shall be devel-
oped, including discontinuation for reasons not related to
efficacy, safety, or feasibility. Safety outcomes, including risk
of genital tears, including cervical tears, and pain during ap-
plication need to be carefully assessed in future research.
