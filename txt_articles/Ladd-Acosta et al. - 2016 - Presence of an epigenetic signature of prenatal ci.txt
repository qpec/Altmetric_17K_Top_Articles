 Prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke has lifelong health consequences. Epigenetic signatures such 
as differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) may be a biomarker of exposure and, further, might 
have functional significance for how in utero tobacco exposure may influence disease risk. 
Differences in infant DNAm associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy have been 
identified. Here we assessed whether these infant DNAm patterns are detectible in early 
childhood, whether they are specific to smoking, and whether childhood DNAm can classify 
prenatal smoke exposure status. Using the Infinium 450 K array, we measured methylation at 26 
CpG loci that were previously associated with prenatal smoking in infant cord blood from 572 
children, aged 3–5, with differing prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke in the Study to Explore 
Early Development (SEED). Striking concordance was found between the pattern of prenatal 
smoking associated DNAm among preschool aged children in SEED and those observed at birth in 
other studies. These DNAm changes appear to be tobacco-specific. Support vector machine 
classification models and 10-fold cross-validation were applied to show classification accuracy for 
childhood DNAm at these 26 sites as a biomarker of prenatal smoking exposure. Classification 
models showed prenatal exposure to smoking can be assigned with 81% accuracy using childhood 
DNAm patterns at these 26 loci. These findings support the potential for blood-derived DNAm 
measurements to serve as biomarkers for prenatal exposure.

 1. Introduction
A considerable proportion (11%) of women in the United States actively smoke during 
pregnancy, a major risk factor for pregnancy complications(Castles et al., 1999; Shah and 
Bracken, 2000) and adverse health outcomes during infancy, childhood and later life 
(Salmasi et al., 2010; Shah and Bracken, 2000). Understanding the impact of early life 
exposure to tobacco smoke on future health has important public health implications.
DNA methylation (DNAm) is a type of epigenetic modification central to development and 
gene regulation. It is of interest as a mediating mechanism in exposure-disease associations, 
and may also have utility as a biological marker of exposure, even if not mechanistically 
implicated (Ladd-Acosta, 2015). Several groups have investigated associations between 
DNAm levels and in utero exposure to tobacco smoke. Using global (Guerrero-Preston et al., 
2010), candidate gene-based (Murphy et al., 2012; Suter et al., 2010), and genome-scale 
(Joubert et al., 2014, 2012; Richmond et al., 2014; Suter et al., 2011) approaches, they 
identified associations between maternal smoking during pregnancy and DNAm levels in 
placental tissue and in DNA from cord blood (Lee and Pausova, 2013; Richmond et al., 
2014). A recent study, using a low-density DNAm array showed detectible prenatal smoking 
associations in childhood, but could not assess the reported birth sample associations now 
confirmed by several groups, given the incompatible array content (Breton et al., 2014). A 
candidate gene-based study (Novakovic et al., 2014) of 11 individuals showed that 
comparable differences in DNAm at AHRR, a tobacco-related gene, were detectable at birth 
as well as at 18 months. Finally, a recent longitudinal investigation revealed some smoking-

 related DNAm alterations, initially detected in their sample at birth, persist within the same 
individuals over time (Richmond et al., 2014). While a few of the loci identified by that 
paper overlap with previous studies, the study did not specifically examine the set of 26 loci 
(Joubert et al., 2012) that have now been well replicated in other birth samples.
Here we attempted to replicate prenatal smoking-associated DNAm differences observed in 
infant cord blood, reported by Jou-bert et al. (2012)), in an independent set of 572 early 
childhood blood samples to determine if the DNAm pattern in childhood is consistent with 
DNAm “signatures” of prenatal smoking detected at birth. This study, focused on prenatal 
smoking, assesses the potential utility of a DNAm signature measured later in life as an 
epigenetic biomarker of prenatal exposure. This study also examines other issues relevant to 
DNAm’s potential as a biomarker for prenatal smoke exposure. First, since it is possible that 
the DNAm changes previously reported in cord blood could be related to downstream 
responses to a range of prenatal exposures and, thus, are not tobacco smoke-specific, we 
explored associations of DNAm changes with other prenatal exposures, including maternal 
alcohol and medication use. Second, we evaluated associations between the previously 
reported DNAm changes and trimester-specific and sustained prenatal smoke exposure. 
Finally, we used machine learning and 10-fold cross-validation to assess whether childhood 
DNAm levels at these 26 sites can predict prenatal exposure to smoking.
 2. Materials and methods
 2.1. Sample inclusion
Study participants included in this analysis are a subset of children enrolled in the Study to 
Explore Early Development (SEED) (Schendel et al., 2012). SEED is a US national case-
control study that has enrolled over 2800 children, and their parents, with approximately 
equal numbers of children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), children from the 
general population (POP controls), and children with a non-ASD developmental delay (DD 
controls) (Schendel et al., 2012) that were all born during the same time frame and same 
geographic areas. SEED has collected extensive information on prenatal exposures and 
biospecimens suitable for DNAm analysis from the same individuals. We measured DNAm 
in whole blood collected from 608 SEED children (mean (SD) age at collection was 59.7 
(6.1) months), for whom we had genome-wide genotyping data, a complete caregiver 
interview, and a sufficient amount of DNA. Both ASD cases (N=289) and typically 
developing control (N=319) children were included to increase power to detect exposure-
associated DNAm changes. To ensure exposure-based differences in DNAm were not driven 
by ASD status, we performed conditional analyses by case control status and in a control-
only subset. After filtering by DNAm quality and cigarette smoke and covariate missing data 
(Supplementary Fig. 1; available as supplementary data online), 572 samples were included 
in the final analyses.
 2.2. Prenatal exposure variables
The prenatal exposure data were collected in the SEED caregiver interview (CGI) with the 
mother, as described previously (Schendel et al., 2012). Retrospective self-report of prenatal 
smoking, while certainly not invulnerable to reporting error, has been shown to be

 comparable to medical records (Rice et al., 2007). Additionally, recall of smoking during 
pregnancy six years later had 90% agreement with smoking assessed during the pregnancy 
(Hensley Alford et al., 2009).
Prenatal exposures were assessed during four exposure windows: the overall pregnancy 
period, and the first (T1), second (T2), and third trimesters (T3). For direct comparison with 
previous birth sample findings (Joubert et al., 2012), we focused our main analyses on 
exposure during T2.
 Cigarette smoking—In utero exposure to either passive household smoking or active 
maternal smoking was determined from CGI responses to questions concerning timing and 
amount of cigarette smoke exposure. Smoking exposures were dichotomized as ‘exposed’ or 
‘unexposed’ during each exposure window. Active smoking during an exposure window was 
defined as either any exposure for > 2 months during the exposure window, or average 
consumption of ≥ 1 cigarette/day for ≥ 1 month during the exposure window. Passive 
smoking was determined from report of another household member smoking ≥ 1 
cigarette/day for ≥ 1 month during the exposure window. Individuals were classified as 
“unexposed” if they had no active or passive smoking exposure throughout the duration of 
the pregnancy to provide the same comparison group for all exposure categories. In addition, 
for active maternal smoking in each exposure window, a three level dose-response variable 
was created: unexposed, 1 to < 10 cigarettes/day, and ≥ 10 cigarettes per day. Lastly, we 
used 3 additional categories of prenatal exposure: (1) sustained active, defined as the mother 
smoking ≥ 1 cigarette per day, on average, for the duration of pregnancy; (2) sustained 
passive, household member smoking ≥ 1 cigarette per day, on average, for the duration of 
pregnancy and no active maternal smoking at any time during pregnancy; and (3) trimester 1 
(T1) quitters, mother smoking ≥ 1 cigarette per day, on average, only during the first 
trimester. The 32 individuals that did not have trimester 2-specific smoking data and 1 
individual missing maternal age and education variables (used as covariates) were excluded 
from all analyses, leaving 572 subjects (Supplementary Fig. 1). We removed 41 individuals 
with no active smoking exposure during T2 but some active or passive exposure at some 
point during pregnancy, leaving 531 total individuals for our T2 smoking analyses. All self-
reported exposure data passed through extensive logic checks to identify responses that did 
not fit expected skip patterns or had inaccurate or nonsensible values. Each discrepancy was 
resolved or coded as missing.
 Other prenatal exposures—To evaluate specificity of the DNAm signature to 
smoking exposure, we examined three other prenatal exposures, maternal use of alcohol and 
two types of medications, based on their availability in SEED (see Supplementary data, 
available online, for details).
 2.3. DNA methylation measurements and quality control
DNAm was isolated from whole blood and measured on the Infinium 450 K Array 
(Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer protocols (see Supplementary data, 
available online). All quality assurance analyses were performed using Bioconductor and 
R-3.0.x. Illumina idat files were obtained and processed using the minfi package (version

 1.8.9) (Aryee et al., 2014). We generated a sample quality control report using the qcReport 
function. We then assessed the correlation of replicate samples across plates to identify 
problems with particular plates/batches and to assess the accuracy of the DNAm values. 
Next, for each sample and each CpG probe, we computed three methylation metrics: (a) the 
total probe intensity (methylated+unmethylated channel values); (b) beta (ratio of 
methylated versus total probe intensity) and (c) M-value (logit (beta)). We removed samples 
with low overall intensities based on total probe intensity (n=2). Sex of each child was 
empirically determined using total probe intensities on the X and Y chromosomes and 
compared to parent-report for discrepancy. Finally, quantile normalization was performed 
(separately for type I, type II, autosome, and sex chromosome probes) and M-values 
computed using the preprocessQuantile minfi function. For plotting, beta values (β), 
obtained via the getBeta function in minfi were used to allow more intuitive interpretation, 
since these range from 0% to 100% methylated. Beta values were also used to estimate cell 
type proportions per sample (see Supplementary data, available online).
 2.4. Statistical analysis
We determined the association between prenatal exposure to smoking and DNAm for the 26 
CpG sites previously implicated in cord blood (Joubert et al., 2012) via general linear 
regression. For each of the 26 loci we fit DNAm M-values as a function of exposure status 
and potential confounders: E(M)= α+ βE+γ1A1+ γ2C2+ γ3M3+ γ4S4+ γ5Y5+ΓX+ɛ, where E 
represents prenatal cigarette smoke exposure status, A1 represents genetically estimated 
racial ancestry (European, African, Admixed), C2 represents ASD case versus POP control, 
M3 represents male child, S4 represents maternal education (less than high school, high 
school of equivalent, college but less than Bachelor’s, Bachelor’s degree, Master’s degree or 
higher), Y5 represents maternal age, and X represents a vector of cell type proportions for 
granulocytes, monocytes, B cells, NK cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8 + T cells, α, β, γ1−γ5, Γ 
represent linear regression coefficients and ɛ represents error. Covariates were chosen given 
reports that they may be associated with DNAm. Maternal age and education were included 
as measures of socioeconomic status (SES), which has been associated with changes in 
DNAm (McGuinness et al., 2012; Tehranifar et al., 2013). The proportion of individuals 
with African, European, and Admixed ancestries, which are correlated with SNP alleles and 
DNAm, varied across exposure groups (Barfield et al., 2014; Drong et al., 2013; Kerkel et 
al., 2008; Liu et al., 2013, 2014; Schmitz et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2014). We used P values 
based on F statistics from linear regression and a significance threshold of 1.92E-03 to 
account for multiple testing of 26 loci. Similar models were run for the other exposure 
variables. P-values for dose-response trends were computed using a Cochran-Armitage test 
for trend via the Bioconductor coin package.
Classification analyses were performed using the Bioconductor caret package (Kuhn, 2008). 
We built a support vector machine (SVM) classification model using a radial basis function 
kernel and SEED childhood DNAm measurements at the 26 sites under investigation in this 
study as attributes. We implemented 10-fold cross-validation to assess the predictive 
accuracy of the SVM classifier, i.e. ability to discriminate between prenatally exposed versus 
unexposed individuals. Using the same SVM-10 fold cross validation procedure, we 
assessed the specificity of the SVM classifier in two ways. First, using the 26 DNAm

 attributes associated with prenatal smoking exposure, we built a SVM classifier to predict 
prenatal exposure to each of three other exposures including maternal use of alcohol, B2AR 
and SSRIs. Second, to determine how well other DNAm signatures based on 26 sites can 
predict prenatal exposure to smoking, we generated 1000 sets of 26 randomly chosen 
DNAm sites, also measured on the 450 K, to use as input attributes for the SVM classifier. 
We report measures of sensitivity (proportion of individuals with reported prenatal exposure 
that are predicted to be prenatally exposed using a classifier built with childhood DNAm 
patterns), specificity (the proportion of individuals with no reported prenatal exposure that 
are predicted to be unexposed using childhood DNAm patterns) as well as a measure of 
overall balanced accuracy ([sensitivity+specificity]/2) that has been shown to be more 
suitable for datasets, like ours, with an imbalanced number of samples in the outcome 
classes (Velez et al., 2007).
 3. Results
 3.1. Study population
For direct comparison with previous birth samples (Joubert et al., 2012), we focused on 
second trimester smoking. No substantial differences were identified between exposed and 
unexposed children with respect to age or sex (Table 1). The proportion of children with 
African, European, and Admixed ancestries across the exposure groups varied and were 
adjusted for in methylation analyses. ASD cases had higher levels of prenatal smoking 
exposure than controls. Stratified and conditional analyses of methylation associations by 
case control status are reported below.
 3.2. DNA methylation quality assurance
Two samples with low overall 450 K intensities and 1 sample with an outlier blood cell 
composition were removed, resulting in high quality DNAm data for 605 samples, 572 with 
T2 prenatal cigarette exposure and covariate data. DNAm was highly reproducible across 
plates and wells, with correlation coefficients for each pair of replicates (n=8) ranging from 
0.989 to 0.994. Our data QC and filtering pipeline is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. We 
found no significant differences in blood cell type compositions between prenatal cigarette 
smoke exposed versus unexposed children (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 
2).
 3.3. DNAm changes associated with in utero smoke exposure
Effect sizes for the association between prenatal cigarette smoke exposure and DNAm in 
SEED children, mean age of 5, show striking similarity to those previously observed in cord 
blood birth samples for all 26 CpG sites (Joubert et al., 2012) (Fig. 1). After adjusting for 
potential confounders, statistical significance (P<1.92E-03) was observed for 7 of these 26 
CpG sites associated with active T2 smoking (Fig. 1 and Table 2). Effect sizes were similar 
with and without adjustment for cell type. Analysis of SEED control-only samples revealed 
a similar pattern of DNAm differences and effect sizes as the complete set of samples 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Similarly, stratified analyses showed the overall DNAm differences, 
effect sizes, and patterns at these 26 loci were similar among males and females 
(Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 2). We observed a sex-specific change at a

 single CpG site (cg11715943), located near the HLA-DPB2 gene, with increased DNAm 
among prenatally exposed females and decreased methylation among prenatally exposed 
males (Supplementary Fig. 4).
 3.4. Dose response relationships
Dose response trend tests were significant for 10 loci, including all 7 sites that were 
significant for dichotomous exposure (Fig. 2). For most loci, the change in methylation 
between 1 and <10 cigarettes per day and >10 cigarettes per day was minimal (e.g. Fig. 2E). 
The biggest methylation differences appear to be between the group with no exposure and 
the group exposed to 1 to <10 cigarettes per day. Directions of trend varied by location. For 
CpGs within or near contactin associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) and growth factor 
independent 1 transcription repressor (GFI1), DNAm levels decreased with exposure (Fig. 
2A and B). All 4 loci located within the gene body of myosin IG (MYO1G) show increased 
DNAm with increasing cigarette exposure (Fig. 2D–G). Similarly, 3 loci located in 
cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A (CYP1A1) show increased DNAm with exposure 
to cigarettes (Fig. 2H–J). Lastly, there is one significant loci within aryl-hydrocarbon 
receptor repressor (AHRR) that shows an increase in DNAm associated with cigarette smoke 
exposure (Fig. 2C).
 3.5. Influences of duration and mode of exposure
The DNAm signature associated with T2 cigarette smoke exposure appears to reflect 
sustained active maternal smoking during pregnancy (Fig. 3A and B). We do not see a 
similar magnitude of DNAm change for these 26 sites in children whose mothers were 
exposed to passive smoking during pregnancy, but did not actively smoke, i.e. their mother 
was only exposed to second hand smoke in the home (Fig. 3C), or in children whose 
mothers quit smoking during the first trimester (Fig. 3D). Multiple loci in MYO1G and 
CYP1A1 show DNAm changes in the same direction for sustained passive smoke exposure 
as for active maternal T2 and sustained active maternal smoking, but with a smaller 
magnitude of change (Fig. 3C). Similarly several loci in MYO1G and CYP1A1 and a single 
locus in GFI1 show DNAm changes in the same direction for T1 active maternal smoke 
exposure as for active maternal T2 and sustained smoking, but with a smaller magnitude of 
change (Fig. 3D).
 3.6. Prenatal smoking exposure class prediction
Classification models showed the 26 site DNAm signature of smoking, present in childhood 
samples, correctly assigns reported prenatal exposure to active maternal smoking during T2. 
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showing the DNAm based predictor 
obtains an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.865 (Fig. 4). Based on the ROC point with 
the greatest overall accuracy, a total of 464/531 SEED samples were correctly classified 
(Supplementary Table 3). Among the 67 misclassified individuals, 7 were reported to be 
exposed to smoking during T2 but were predicted to be unexposed via DNAm, i.e. are false 
negatives (Supplementary Table 3), and 60 were reported to be unexposed but were 
predicted to be exposed, i.e. are false positives (Supplementary Table 3); reflecting a 
sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 88%, and an overall accuracy of 81% (Table 3). We 
observed similar results when considering sustained smoking exposure, with an AUC of 0.87 
Ladd-Acosta et al.

 (Fig. 4) and 491/529 individuals correctly classified when considering the point with the 
greatest overall accuracy. 8 out of 38 misclassified individuals were predicted to be 
unexposed, based on their DNAm patterns at these 26 sites, but actually reported exposure 
(Supplementary Table 4). The 30 remaining misclassified individuals were reported to be 
unexposed but were predicted as being exposed based on the DNAm classifier 
(Supplementary Table 4). As shown in Table 3, for sustained prenatal exposure to smoking, 
our SVM classifier had an overall accuracy of 80%, specificity of 94%, and sensitivity of 
67%. We were not able to achieve this level of accuracy or specificity using different sets of 
26 sites chosen at random (Fig. 4B and C; Table 3; Supplementary Fig. 5).
 3.7. Exposure specificity of DNAm changes
None of the other three prenatal exposure domains examined here showed an effect size 
pattern similar to the smoking signature pattern seen in previous studies and our SEED 
samples, nor were there statistically significant associations for any of the 26 loci examined 
(Fig. 5; Supplementary Table 5). Additionally, classification models revealed the 26 site 
DNAm signature of prenatal smoking is a poor predictor of prenatal exposure to maternal 
alcohol, SSRI and B2AR use, with area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.529 to 0.563 
and balanced accuracies less than 0.60 across all three of these exposure domains (Fig. 4A; 
Table 3).
 4. Discussion
We show similar patterns of DNAm effect sizes for associations with exposure to prenatal 
cigarette smoke in 3–5 year-old children that were previously reported in other studies of 
newborns. While our observation is in an independent set of children, this suggests prenatal 
exposure-driven DNAm differences are still detectable later in childhood. We observed dose-
dependent associations for some loci, specific to smoking, that likely reflect changes 
associated with sustained in utero exposure to maternal smoking. Additionally, we provide 
evidence that childhood DNAm patterns can accurately and specifically predict prenatal 
exposure to smoking.
We were unable to directly assess the confidence interval overlap between our observed 
effect sizes and those previously reported in newborns (Joubert et al., 2012), because the 
intervals are not provided in the previous report, although it appears that the effect sizes in 
our 3–5 year-olds are systematically weaker than those in newborns. This may reflect 
attenuation of a prenatally-driven association through time. Further work in older children 
and via longitudinal data analysis is warranted. Interestingly, smoking associated changes in 
DNAm at dozens of genes are consistent across adult studie s(Philibert et al., 2013; Shenker 
et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013; Zeilinger et al., 2013), but they do not completely overlap with 
the changes in DNAm observed in neonates and children with prenatal exposure. 
Differential DNAm at 3 genes, AHRR, MYO1G, and GFI1, is associated with smoke 
exposure in adults (Philibert et al., 2013; Shenker et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013; Zeilinger et 
al., 2013), neonates (Joubert et al., 2012; Novakovic et al., 2014), and children (Novakovic 
et al., 2014), but the effect sizes for AHRR, consistently the gene with the largest magnitude 
of change between smokers and non-smokers in adults, are much smaller in prenatally

 exposed samples. In contrast, CYP1A1 was identified and validated in prenatally exposed 
neonates (Joubert et al., 2012), and in our sample of 3–5 year olds but has not been 
identified in adults.
Pre- and postnatal cigarette smoke exposure effects can be difficult to disentangle in this 
SEED sample and likely have different biological implications. In 3–5 year-olds, it is 
possible that postnatal smoking exposure (limited at this age to secondhand exposure, for 
which we have no data) influenced DNAm signatures. However, these loci were previously 
implicated in newborns, where there was no postnatal exposure possible. Therefore, it is 
unlikely that the signals we report are due solely to postnatal exposure. It is possible that 
children exposed to household smoking postnatally, but not in utero, could show epigenetic 
changes at these same locations and that this may result in the attenuated signals we observe, 
assuming the developing fetus is more susceptible to smoke-associated changes in DNAm. 
In contrast, children exposed in uteri are typically also exposed postnatally, and we would 
expect increased association effects in such children. We cannot estimate the correlation 
between pre- and postnatal exposure in the SEED sample with our current data. Maternal 
passive smoke exposure did not result in the same magnitude of effect, perhaps indicating 
postnatal passive exposure is less likely to contribute to the patterns.
While tests for trend were significant for many assessments of a 3 level smoking variable, 
the findings appeared to be largely driven by exposure to any smoking (i.e. a move from no 
to low levels of smoking) rather than by a specific dose response. Nonetheless, it is notable 
that methylation effects were observed with both low and high exposure to cigarette smoke. 
For CNTNAP2, GFI1, ENSG00000225718, MYO1G, and CYP1A1 the change in DNAm 
was in the same direction across the set of CpG sites representing each particular gene. 
However for AHRR, we observed both increases and decreases in DNAm associated with 
smoking exposure. Although the 2 sites are annotated to the same gene, they are about 53 
Kb away from each other and appear to be associated with different RNA transcripts. 
Furthermore, one site (cg05575921) is located at a gene enhancer, a type of genomic 
element that exerts distal control over gene expression. It is possible that although these 2 
sites associated with AHRR have different DNAm directions, they may have similar 
downstream effects on gene expression given their gene location differences.
Although we were able to demonstrate exposure specificity of effect, we considered a 
limited range of other exposures and were unable to include exposures that may be more 
similar to cigarette smoke, such as air pollution. Although we did not see the same striking 
difference in DNAm for the children whose mothers quit smoking during T1, it is possible 
that there are other loci in the genome specifically associated with T1 exposure. Further 
research will be needed to characterize specific windows of susceptibility within pregnancy 
(or early life), and will likely require close collaboration between bench scientists and 
epidemiologists.
The use of blood as a measurement tissue for epigenetic research requires two 
considerations: first, that blood is a mixture of cell types, each with its own DNAm signature 
for a subset of the epigenome; and second, that blood may not be a relevant tissue for studies 
of diseases not primarily affecting blood. With regard to the former, we carried out quality

 assurance analyses and demonstrated no relationship with cell composition and smoking 
exposure status. Additionally, we observed similar effect sizes with and without adjustment 
for cell type. Regarding blood as the tissue of measurement, several studies have shown 
blood to be a relevant surrogate even when studying diseases that primarily affect other 
tissues (Davies et al., 2012; Kaminsky et al., 2012; Talens et al., 2010; Waterland et al., 
2010). Moreover, blood-derived epigenetic signatures can have utility as prenatal exposure 
biomarkers, even when blood is not primarily involved in the disease being studied (Ladd-
Acosta, 2015).
We show a childhood blood-derived DNAm signature associated with prenatal cigarette 
smoke exposure that is consistent with results from cord blood. These findings suggest 
blood-derived DNAm measurements obtained during childhood may contain patterns that 
reflect in utero exposure to cigarette smoke. Additionally, we show that a DNAm signature 
present in childhood can accurately predict prenatal exposure to smoking. Our results 
provide a proof of principle example supporting the potential utility of DNAm as a 
biomarker of prenatal exposures more generally. Further work is needed to fully assess the 
utility of DNAm signatures as biomarkers of prenatal exposure. If successful, this has broad 
implications for the study of prenatal exposure effects on childhood and even adult disorders 
using biosamples collected many years after birth.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for prediction of prenatal exposure using 
childhood methylation levels show high discrimination of children exposed to prenatal 
smoking. (A) Our 26-site methylation prediction model discriminates T2 active and 
sustained maternal smoking well but not T2 alcohol use, T2 SSRI use or T2 B2AR use. (B, 
C) Random sets of 26 methylation loci from the same array do not discriminate between 
prenatally exposed (to T2 active maternal smoking (B); to sustained active maternal smoking 
(C)) and unexposed individuals.

aAttributes correspond to methylation values at specific loci, as measured by the 450 K array.
bWe report values that yielded the greatest overall balanced accuracy.
cGiven the imbalanced proportion of exposed and unexposed individuals in our dataset, we report balanced accuracy28, 29.
*One thousand different sets of 26 randomly selected 450 K sites were selected as SVM input attributes. In the table we report the mean sensitivity, 
specificity, and balanced accuracy rates across all 1000 sets examined.
