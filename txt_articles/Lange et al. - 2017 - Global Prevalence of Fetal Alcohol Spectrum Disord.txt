IMPORTANCE Prevalence estimates are essential to effectively prioritize, plan, and deliver
health care to high-needs populations such as children and youth with fetal alcohol spectrum
disorder (FASD). However, most countries do not have population-level prevalence data
for FASD.
OBJECTIVE To obtain prevalence estimates of FASD among children and youth in the general
population by country, by World Health Organization (WHO) region, and globally.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, EMBASE, Education Resource Information
Center, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, PsychINFO,
and Scopus were systematically searched for studies published from November 1, 1973,
through June 30, 2015, without geographic or language restrictions.
STUDY SELECTION Original quantitative studies that reported the prevalence of FASD among
children and youth in the general population, used active case ascertainment or clinic-based
methods, and specified the diagnostic guideline or case definition used were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Individual study characteristics and prevalence of FASD
were extracted. Country-specific random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. For
countries with 1 or no empirical study on the prevalence of FASD, this indicator was estimated
based on the proportion of women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy per 1 case of
FASD. Finally, WHO regional and global mean prevalence of FASD weighted by the number
of live births in each country was estimated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of FASD.
RESULTS A total of 24 unique studies including 1416 unique children and youth diagnosed
with FASD (age range, 0-16.4 years) were retained for data extraction. The global prevalence
of FASD among children and youth in the general population was estimated to be 7.7 per
1000 population (95% CI, 4.9-11.7 per 1000 population). The WHO European Region had the
highest prevalence (19.8 per 1000 population; 95% CI, 14.1-28.0 per 1000 population), and
the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region had the lowest (0.1 per 1000 population; 95% CI,
0.1-0.5 per 1000 population). Of 187 countries, South Africa was estimated to have the
highest prevalence of FASD at 111.1 per 1000 population (95% CI, 71.1-158.4 per 1000
population), followed by Croatia at 53.3 per 1000 population (95% CI, 30.9-81.2 per 1000
population) and Ireland at 47.5 per 1000 population (95% CI, 28.0-73.6 per 1000 population).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Globally, FASD is a prevalent alcohol-related developmental
disability that is largely preventable. The findings highlight the need to establish a universal
public health message about the potential harm of prenatal alcohol exposure and a routine
screening protocol. Brief interventions should be provided, where appropriate.

range of adverse health effects to the developing fetus,

tional, and adaptive functioning deficits, as well as congenital

holspectrumdisorder(FASD),whichconsistsofasmanyas4di-
agnosticentities,includingfetalalcoholsyndrome(FAS),partial

pending on the diagnostic guideline, alcohol-related birth

oping fetus, and as such, individuals with FASD may experi-
enceabroadarrayofcomorbidconditions.Arecentstudyiden-
tified 428 comorbid conditions in individuals with FASD, with

cal Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th
Revision(ICD-10).4Thus,cliniciansfromallspecialtiesandother
healthserviceprofessionalswilllikelyencountercasesofFASD.
The effects of prenatal alcohol exposure have lifelong implica-
tions, and thus, FASD is costly for society.5,6 For example, the
lifetime cost for a person with FASD in North America is esti-
mated at more than $1 million.7,8
Although human research has not been able to delineate
the pattern, amount, and/or critical period of prenatal alco-
hol exposure necessary for structural and/or functional tera-
togenesis, animal models have demonstrated that all stages of
embryonic development are vulnerable to the teratogenic ef-
fects of alcohol.9 Furthermore, the type and severity of birth
defects induced by prenatal alcohol exposure are largely de-
pendent on the pattern of exposure, the dose, and the devel-
opmental stage of the embryo at the time of exposure.9-13 Mul-
tiple animal models have also shown that even low levels of
prenatalalcoholexposurecanleadtobraindysfunction,which
can lead to behavioral abnormalities.14 However, beyond the
amountofalcoholconsumedandthegestationaltimingofcon-
sumption, multiple factors (eg, variability in the metabolism
and genetic background of the mother and fetus, environmen-
tal influences, maternal age, smoking, nutritional status, stress
levels, and possibly paternal lifestyle) modify fetal suscepti-
bility to the teratogenic effects of ethanol.15-17
Updated prevalence estimates are essential to effectively
prioritize, plan, and deliver health care to high-needs popu-
lations, such as children and youth with FASD. These esti-
mates are also vital for assessing the population burden of dis-
easeandallocationofresourcesforhealthcareandprevention.
In much of the world, no prevalence estimates of FASD exist,
which may influence prioritization of health care expendi-
tures for care related to FASD. Until recently, a meaningful es-
timateofFASDprevalencewasnotpossible.However,thepub-
lication of more representative rates of prenatal alcohol
exposureandimproveddataontheprevalenceofFASDinsome
settings now allows for estimates of the prevalence of FASD
globally. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to esti-
mate the prevalence of FASD among children and youth in the
general population globally, by World Health Organization
(WHO) region, and by country. We then compared the global
prevalence estimate of FASD among children and youth in the
general population with the prevalence of FASD among spe-
cial populations, such as aboriginal, correctional, and low so-
cioeconomic status populations; those undergoing psychiat-
ric care; and children in care (eg, in foster care, residing in
orphanages, and adopted), obtained from select studies.
Methods
The comprehensive systematic literature search and meta-
analyses were conducted and reported according to the stan-
dards of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis of Observational
StudiesinEpidemiology(MOOSE)reportingguidelines.18,19The
full review protocol is available in the PROSPERO database.20
Comprehensive Systematic Search Strategy
We performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE,
MEDLINE in process, EMBASE, Education Resource Informa-
tionCenter,CumulativeIndextoNursingandAlliedHealthLit-
erature, Web of Science, PsychINFO, and Scopus to identify all
studies that have reported the prevalence of FASD among the
general population (keywords are given in eTable 1 in the
Supplement). The search was not limited geographically or by
language of publication and included studies published from
November 1, 1973 (when FAS was first described21), through
June30,2015.Non–English-languagestudiesdeemedtobepo-
tentially relevant were translated by colleagues fluent in the
respective language or using Google Translate (and subse-
quently cross-checked by a native speaker). In addition to the
electronic search, we manually reviewed the content pages of
the major epidemiologic journals and the citations in the rel-
evant articles. Effort was also made to contact the leading in-
ternational FASD experts and researchers to identify any pend-
ing publications on the prevalence of FASD.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Articles were included in the meta-analysis if they (1) con-
sisted of original, quantitative research published in a peer-
reviewed journal or scholarly report; (2) involved a measure-
Key Points
Question What is the prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum
disorder among children and youth in the general population?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 24 unique studies and 1416
unique children and youth with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder,
approximately 8 of 1000 in the general population had fetal
alcohol spectrum disorder, and 1 of every 13 pregnant women
who consumed alcohol during pregnancy delivered a child with
fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. The prevalence of fetal alcohol
spectrum disorder was found to be notably higher among special
populations.
Meaning The prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder
among children and youth in the general population exceeds 1% in
76 countries, which underscores the need for universal prevention
initiatives targeting maternal alcohol consumption, screening
protocols, and improved access to diagnostic services, especially
in special populations.

within the spectrum); (3) provided the prevalence of FASD
with a measure of uncertainty (CI or SE) or the necessary
information to calculate uncertainty (ie, sample size or num-
ber of cases); (4) specified the diagnostic guideline or case
definition used to ascertain cases; and (5) used active case
ascertainment (when researchers actively seek, assess, and
identify cases; ie, the criterion standard) or clinic-based
methods (prospectively conducted studies in prenatal clinics
or hospitals). We excluded articles from the meta-analysis if
they (1) reported a pooled estimate by combining several
studies; (2) used passive surveillance (the use of existing rec-
ord collections) to obtain the prevalence of FASD; or (3) were
published in iteration. We placed no restriction on the age of
participants (ie, articles were not excluded if they reported
the prevalence of FASD among adults).
Critical Appraisal of Identified Studies
We critically appraised each study by using a tool recently de-
veloped specifically for use in systematic reviews addressing
questions of prevalence.22 The following 7 criteria were used:
(1) representative sample of the target population; (2) appro-
priate recruitment of participants; (3) adequate sample size
(≥300); (4) detailed description of participants and setting;
(5) sufficient coverage of the identified sample (ie, nonre-
sponders were described and compared with those in the
study); (6) use of objective, standard criteria for ascertaining
FASD; and (7) appropriateness of statistical analysis.
Data Extraction
After the data were extracted from the identified articles, one
of us (S.L.) checked extracted data for accuracy against the
original articles. All discrepancies were reconciled by team dis-
cussion. We extracted the following variables from the iden-
tified articles: country, study year(s), sample size, number of
cases, prevalence, 95% CI, age range, percentage of male par-
ticipants in the sample, method of ascertainment, and the
diagnostic guideline or case definition used.
Meta-analyses

analysis assuming a random-effects model23 for each country
with2ormoreexistingstudiesontheprevalenceofFASD.Asrec-
ommended for meta-analyses of prevalence and to prevent the
overweighting of studies reporting extremely low prevalence
(ie,aprevalenceapproachingzero),24,25wetransformedthedata
using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation.26 We

correlationtest29;and(3)aweightedregressiontest.30However,
wedeemedpublicationbiastobeunlikelybecauseanobserved
prevalence of FASD that was substantially different than had
previously been estimated would likely have been published.
Therefore, if found to be present, we did not adjust for publica-
tion bias. All meta-analyses were performed using R software
(version 3.2.2).31
Prevalence Estimation
For countries with 1 or no empirical study, we estimated the
prevalenceofFASDbyusingcountry-specificdataonthepreva-
lence of alcohol use during pregnancy (obtained from Popova
et al32). First, we estimated a quotient of the mean number of
women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy per 1 case
of FASD by using the pooled estimates of the prevalence of
FASD available from countries with a WHO drinking pattern
score of 3 or less.32 A country’
s drinking pattern score reflects
how people in the respective country drink instead of how
much they drink and is measured on a scale from 1 (least risky
pattern of drinking) to 5 (most risky pattern of drinking); the
higher the score, the greater the alcohol-attributable burden
of disease. To produce the most conservative estimations, we
excluded the estimates of the prevalence of FASD available
from countries with a drinking pattern score of 4 or more, be-
cause it would have led to an unrealistically high ratio. These
data were then linked to the prevalence of alcohol use during
pregnancyforeachrespectivecountry.Second,weappliedthis
quotient to the country-specific prevalence of alcohol use dur-
ing pregnancy to estimate the prevalence of FASD. To derive
the CI for the FASD prevalence point estimate, we conducted
Monte Carlo simulations,33 generating 1 million samples per
country. We used the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the re-
sultingdistributionastheCI.TheMonteCarlosimulationswere
performed using Python software (version 2.7).34 Additional
methodological details can be found in the eMethods in the
Supplement and in the study by Popova and colleagues.32
Global and Regional Estimates of the Prevalence of FASD
Among Children and Youth in the General Population
To estimate the prevalence of FASD by WHO region and glob-
ally, we calculated a weighted mean prevalence of FASD,
weighted by the number of live births in each country for the
latestavailableyear(2000-2014).35WeconductedMonteCarlo
simulations to estimate the CI (as described above).
Comparison of the Global Prevalence of FASD
Among Children and Youth in the General Population
With the Prevalence in Special Populations
We compared the global prevalence estimate of FASD among
children and youth in the general population with the preva-
lenceofFASDinspecialpopulationsofvariouscountries,using
select studies in the current literature. The associated CI was
estimated based on an exact binomial distribution.

Discussion
This study identified several important public health issues.
First, based on the existing data, 1 of every 13 pregnant women
who consumed alcohol during pregnancy is estimated to have
had a child with FASD. Second, this finding leads to an esti-
mate that more than 1700 infants with FASD are born every
day (630 000 every year) globally. Third, FASD is notably more
frequent among special populations (eg, aboriginal popula-
tions, children in care, incarcerated populations, and those in
psychiatric care). The higher prevalence emphasizes that these
high-risk populations deserve special attention for the plan-
ning and organization of targeted screening strategies, im-
proved access to diagnostic services, and prevention of ma-
ternal alcohol consumption. Fourth, the burden of FASD is
elevated in 76 of the 187 countries included in this study, as
demonstrated by having a prevalence of FASD that exceeds 1%.
In these countries, the prevalence of FASD among children and
youth in the general population is higher than the prevalence
of some common birth defects in the United States, such as an-
encephaly, Down syndrome, spina bifida, and trisomy 18.75
Most affected children and youth will require lifelong care
fortheever-changingphenotypeofFASD.Thedemandsforthis

duct disorder).69 This focus diminishes the likelihood of care
organizedaroundtheirdevelopmentalcourse,preventionofex-
posureintheiryoungersiblings,andanticipationofthelong-term
impairments likely to occur in children and youth with FASD.77
A diagnosis of FASD has several potentially important ben-
efitsforaffectedchildrenandyouth,namely,earlyaccesstode-
velopmental interventions, improved quality of life, and ulti-
matelyamoreprosperousdevelopmentaltrajectoryintermsof
socialfunctioning.Currently,severalclinicalguidelinesareavail-

andaccuracyofthevariousdiagnosticcriteriaareunknownbe-
cause,atpresent,noexternalstandardagainstwhichadiagnos-
tic systems classification function can be measured exists.78,79
The absence of widely accepted standardized criteria can
ultimately lead to diagnostic misclassification.80 Thus, a need
exists for a common diagnostic approach to be developed. Ide-
ally, novel and reliable biomarkers for detecting fetal effects of
alcohol and low and moderate levels of alcohol consumption
during pregnancy will be identified. Accurate diagnosis is com-
plicated by the fact that children and youth with FASD have in-
creasedratesofcomorbidities.Recently,Popovaandcolleagues4
reported that more than 9 in 10 of those with FAS had co-
occurring problems with conduct, approximately 8 in 10 had
communication disorders related to understanding or express-
ing language, and more than half had attention-deficit/

Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of this study include the comprehensive search
strategy, strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, critical ap-
praisalofidentifiedstudies,rigorousidentificationofdualpub-
lications (thereby avoiding any potential of double counting
cases), analytic strategy, use of country-specific indicators to
predict the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy, and
innovative evidence-based statistical analysis. Although the
present study used the best available data and provides, to our

 knowledge, the first estimates of FASD globally, by WHO re-
gion,andfor187countries,severallimitationssupporttheneed
for further research in this area. First, the prevalence of FASD
in those countries with 1 or no empirical study was estimated
using self-report data on the prevalence of alcohol use during
pregnancy, which is vulnerable to reporting and recall biases.
As such, the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy may
be an underestimate. Second, the identified studies used dif-
ferent diagnostic guidelines and case definitions to ascertain
cases of FASD, which may have affected the estimated pooled
prevalence of FASD in the present study (the direction of this
effect depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the diag-
nostic system79). Third, not all studies included in the meta-
analyses were conducted on nationally representative popu-
lation-basedsamples(eg,clinic-basedstudies);therefore,some
regionally confined studies may have been conducted where
FASD was more prevalent. Fourth, the estimated predicted
prevalence may differ from the true prevalence owing to the
fact that the data from which the values were estimated carry
measurement error and uncertainty. Fifth, examination of the
effect of timing, dose, and frequency of prenatal alcohol ex-
posure on the risk of FASD was not possible.81
In addition, not many countries have actual data on the
prevalenceofFASD.Thus,theresultsofthepresentstudyhigh-
lighttheneedforcountriestoconducttheirowncross-sectional
