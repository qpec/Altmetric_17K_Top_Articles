Context: In the past decade, over 3 dozen studies reported a relationship between self-reported
short sleep and disturbed glucose metabolism. A study with insulin sensitivity assessed according
to the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp is, however, still missing.
Objective: To evaluate the cross-sectional association of sleep duration with insulin sensitivity and
�-cell function in the European group for the study of insulin resistance (EGIR-RISC) study cohort.
Design, Setting, Participants, and Measures: We used data from the baseline measurements of the
European, multicentre EGIR-RISC study that included 1319 clinically healthy participants. Sleep and
physical activity were measured using a single-axis accelerometer. Insulin sensitivity and �-cell
function were estimated by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and from the oral glucose insulin
sensitivity index model, using an oral glucose tolerance test. Associations of sleep duration with
insulin sensitivity and �-cell function were analyzed by multiple linear regression, stratified by sex.
Results: In our current analysis, we included 788 participants (57% women, age 44 � 8 y), who had
an average sleep duration of 7.3 � 1.5 hours. In men, we observed an inverted U-shaped association
between sleep duration categorized per hour and M/I (in �mol/min per kgFFM/nM per hour) (�-
estimate [95% confidence intervals] 41 [2, 80]; P � .04 and �2-estimate �3 [�6, �0.2], P � .04) as
well as a trend for the oral glucose insulin sensitivity index (in mL/min per kgFFM) (�-estimate [95%
confidence intervals] 0.8 [�0.4, 2]; P � .17). In women, we observed a U-shaped association be-
tween sleep duration and �-cell function (in pmol/min per m2/mM per hour) (�-estimate �45 [�86,
�3]; P � .04 and �2-estimate 3 [0.2, 6]; P � .04).
Conclusions: Sleep duration is associated with insulin sensitivity and �-cell function in a sex-specific
manner in clinically healthy people. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 3272–3280, 2016)

n the last 50 years, the average self-reported sleep du-
ration has decreased by 1.5–2 hours, whereas the prev-
alence of diabetes has doubled in the same time period (1).
Although this evidence is circumstantial, recent meta-
analyses indeed support the role of sleep curtailment in the
development of diabetes (2–5). Data from over a dozen
experimental studies showed decreases in insulin sensitiv-
ity and �-cell function after sleep deprivation, including

 studies using the gold standard, a hyperinsulinemic-
euglycemic clamp (6–16). One experimental study even
showed that 1 night without sleep is sufficient to induce
insulin resistance in healthy participants (6).
Data from over 30 epidemiological studies showed a
negative or U-shaped relationship between self-reported
sleep duration and incident diabetes or impaired glucose
metabolism, with both short and long sleep being associ-
ated with an increased risk (3–5). The strength of the ob-
served associations was variable, with the relative risk of
incident diabetes ranging from 0.97 (0.8, 1.1) to 2.8 (1.1,
7.2) (3–5). A study on the relationship between sleep du-
ration, insulin sensitivity, and �-cell function, with insulin
sensitivity assessed according to the gold standard hyper-
insulinemic-euglycemic clamp, is, however, still missing.
In this study, we evaluated the cross-sectional associa-
tion of sleep duration with insulin sensitivity and �-cell
function in the European group for the study of insulin
resistance (EGIR-RISC) study cohort (17).
Materials and Methods
The rationale and design of the EGIR-RISC study have been
described previously (17). In brief, clinically healthy study par-
ticipants aged 30–60 years were recruited from 19 study centers
in 14 European countries. Exclusion criteria for participation
included prevalent cardiovascular disease and treatment for obe-
sity, arterial hypertension, lipid disorders, or diabetes. Further
exclusion criteria were systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP)
more than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg, fasting plasma glucose
more than or equal to 7.0 mmol/L, 2-hour plasma glucose more
than or equal to 11.1 mmol/L, total cholesterol more than or
equal to 7.8 mmol/L, or triglyceride levels more than or equal to
4.6 mmol/L.
Using a standardized protocol, the baseline assessments in-
cluded anthropometrics, BP measurements, fasting blood sam-
pling,anoralglucosetolerancetest(OGTT),ahyperinsulinemic-
euglycemic clamp, lifestyle, and medical history questionnaires
as well as assessment of physical activity and sleep with an ac-
celerometer. In total, between 2002 and 2004, more than 1500
study participants were examined, and 1319 participants had a
2-hour hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. A total of 847 par-
ticipants wore the accelerometer; however, only 788 had worn it
for at least 3 days. The 59 participants without correct sleep and
activity measures were excluded from the study. The EGIR-RISC
study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and ethical ap-
proval was obtained from the local ethics committees. All par-
ticipants gave written informed consent before study inclusion.
Sleep duration
Sleep and physical activity were measured objectively by a
small single-axis accelerometer (Actigraph, AM7164-2.2; Com-
puterScienceandApplications)(18).Theaccelerationsignalwas
digitized with 10 samples per second, registered as counts over
1-minute intervals. The accelerometer was worn for up to 8 days
on a belt in the small of the back, from waking to bedtime except
during water-based activities. We analyzed participants with at
least 3 days of data, including days when the device was worn
more than 12 hours and less than 23 hours.
Accelerometer data were processed with custom software de-
veloped for this project using SAS version 9, as described earlier
byotherEGIR-RISCresearchers(19–21).Datawerecheckedfor
spurious recording: high counts more than 20 000 counts per
minute and repeated counts. For each day with valid data as
defined above, our software computed the following:
-daily sedentary time (min) with less than 100 counts per
minute worn,
-daily moderate physical activity (min) with 1952–5724
counts per minute worn,
-daily vigorous physical activity (min) with more than 5724
counts per minutes-worn, and
-daily light physical activity (min) with 100–1952 counts per
minute worn (19–21).
We estimated daily sleep duration (min) based on the time the
device was not worn for more than 60 consecutive minutes. This
assumption may, however, include some water-based activities
for which the accelerometer was not worn. To assess the validity
of our assumption, we determined the correlation between the
accelerometer data at baseline and a sleep questionnaire com-
pleted at the 3-year follow-up. The sleep questionnaire assessed
the average sleep duration (h) on weekdays and weekend days,
from which average sleep duration was calculated (sleep week-
day � 5 � sleep weekend � 2)/7 (22). Questionnaire data were
available in 603 participants and we observed a significant as-
sociation between the 2 measures (r � 0.31, P � .05), which is
similar to data published by Kripke et al (23), who showed a
correlation coefficient of r � 0.35 between sleep duration as-
sessed with an accelerometer and sleep duration assessed with a
questionnaire, at the same point in time. While we observed a
mean difference of �0.8 hours (range, 5.9 h) between the accel-
erometer data and questionnaire data, we corrected for this dif-
ference (23). The uncorrected data showed very similar associ-
ations with insulin sensitivity and �-cell function (data not
shown). Overall, sleep duration was categorized per hour.
Two-hour hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
We conducted a 2-hour hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
with a primed-continuous infusion rate of 240 pmol/min per m2
and a variable dextrose infusion adjusted every 5–10 minutes to
maintain the plasma glucose level within 0.8 mmol/L (�15%) of
target glucose (4.5–5.5 mmol/L). The procedure was standard-
ized across centers using a written protocol and a video demon-
stration, and data from the clamp were quality controlled cen-
trally. Insulin sensitivity calculated from the clamp results was
expressed the ratio of the M value calculated during the final 40
minutes of the clamp and normalized to the mean plasma insulin
(I) in the same period and to fat-free mass (M/I, in �mol/min per
kgFFM/nM) (24). Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose
oxidase technique (Cobas Integra; Roche). Plasma insulin and
C-peptide were measured by a 2-site time-resolved immunofluo-
rometric assays (AutoDELFIA Insulin kit; Wallac Oy), using
monoclonal antibodies.
Oral glucose tolerance test
At least 1 week before the 2-hour hyperinsulinemic-euglyce-
mic clamp, participants underwent a 75-g OGTT after an over-
night fast. Blood samples were taken before and during the test

 at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Insulin sensitivity calculated
from the OGTT results was expressed as the oral glucose insulin
sensitivity (OGIS) index (mL/min per kgFFM), using glucose and
insulin levels at 0, 90, and 120 minutes of the OGTT (25). �-Cell
function calculated from the OGTT results (26, 27) was ex-
pressed as 3 model-based insulin secretion parameters (28);
�-cell glucose sensitivity, the potentiation factor ratio and �-cell
rate sensitivity (26, 27). In the model, insulin secretion depends
onabsoluteglucoseconcentrationthroughadose-responsefunc-
tion. �-cell glucose sensitivity is defined as the mean dose-re-
sponse slope over the observed glucose range. The potentiation
factormodulatesthedose-responserelationship,whichaccounts
for higher insulin secretion during the descending phase of hy-
perglycaemia compared with the ascending phase with the same
glucose concentration during acute stimulation. The potentia-
tion factor is set as a positive function of time and to average 1
during the OGTT. Therefore, it represents the relative potenti-
ation of the insulin secretion response to glucose. The potenti-
ation parameter used in the present analysis is the ratio of the
potentiation factor at the end of the 2-hour OGTT to the one at
the start. Finally, �-cell rate sensitivity represents the dynamic
dependence of insulin secretion on the rate of change in glucose
concentration and represents early insulin release.
Metabolic syndrome markers
We measured body weight and fat mass by bioelectric im-
pedance (TBF 300; Tanita), height with a stadiometer and waist
circumference with a horizontally placed tailor’s tape measure
midway between the lower costal margin and the iliac crest on
lightly clad participants. The body mass index (BMI) was cal-
culated as weight/height squared (kg/m2). Secondly, sitting BP
(mm Hg) was measured 3 times (OMRON 705 cp; OMRON
Healthcare Europe); median values were used in the analyses.
Plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cho-
lesterol, and triglycerides were measured by Roche enzymatic
colorimetric methods for Modular Systems (Hoffmann La-
Roche). Low-density lipoprotein concentration was calculated
by the Friedewald formula (29).
Other variables
Smoking habits (current or previous smoking vs no smoking:
yes/no), daily alcohol intake (g/d), and family history of diabetes
were assessed using questionnaires.
Statistical analysis
Normally distributed continuous data were presented as
means (SD), skewed continuous data as medians (quartiles), and
categorical data were presented as percentages. We used linear
regression models with second order polynomials to assess the
(U-shaped) association between sleep duration and markers of
insulin sensitivity, �-cell function, and the metabolic syndrome.
The results were presented with one or 2 coefficients (�s) de-
pending on the significance of the first or second order polyno-
mial. If the second order term was significant in the crude model,
we reported it in the following adjusted models, even when it was
not significant. Because we observed interaction effects for sex,
all analyses were stratified by sex. Models were sequentially ad-
justed for age, recruitment center, BMI, smoking, and physical
activity. When necessary data were log10 transformed, and data
were presented transformed to the original units. Statistical anal-
yses used SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Inc), and P � .05 was con-
sidered to be statistically significant.
Results
Data were available in 788 participants (57% women, age
44 � 8 y), who had an average sleep duration of 7.3 � 1.5
hours. There were no significant differences in age or sex
between study participants with and without sleep mea-
surements. Participants with sleep data, however, had bet-
ter clinical characteristics; higher M/I and OGIS values, a
lower BMI, and lower triglyceride levels (data not shown),
suggesting our current study population is somewhat
healthier compared with the total EGIR-RISC population.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of our current study pop-
ulation, for men and women.
With regard to insulin sensitivity (Figure 1, A and B,
and Table 2), in men, we observed an inverted U-shaped
association between sleep duration categorized per hour
and M/I (in �mol/min per kgFFM/nM per hour; �-estimate

(in (mL/min per kgFFM; �-estimate [95% confidence in-
tervals] 0.8 [�0.4, 2]; P � .17). These results suggest that
men with short or long sleep duration are less insulin sen-
sitive, compared with those with average sleep duration.
The association with M/I became nonsignificant, P value be-
tween0.06and0.08,aftercorrectionforpotentialconfound-
ers.Withregardtoinsulinsensitivity,inwomen,weobserved
the opposite: sleep duration was not significantly related to
M/I, but a U-shaped association was observed between sleep
durationandOGIS(in(mL/minperkgFFM;�-estimate(95%
confidence intervals) �1.3 [�2, 0)]; P � .06 and �2-estimate

0.1 [0.1, 0.2]; P � .04). These results suggest that women
with short or long sleep duration are more insulin sensitive,
compared with those with average sleep duration. The as-
sociation was not confounded by age, recruitment center,
BMI, smoking, or physical activity.
With regard to markers of �-cell function (Figure 2 and
Table 2), in women we observed a U-shaped association
between sleep duration and �-cell glucose sensitivity (in
pmol/min per m2/mM per hour �-estimate �45 [�86,
�3]; P � .04 and �2-estimate 3 [0.2, 6]; P � .04). These
results suggest that women with short or long sleep dura-
tion have a better �-cell function, compared with those
with average sleep duration. The association was not con-
founded by age, recruitment center, or BMI and became
stronger after correction for smoking and physical activ-
ity. In women, no significant associations were observed
for the potentiation factor ratio or �-cell rate sensitivity,
whereas in men, no significant associations were observed
with any of the �-cell function markers.
With regard to markers of the metabolic syndrome (Ta-
ble 3), in men, we observed a U-shaped association be-
tween sleep duration and fasting glucose levels (in
mmol/L, �-estimate �0.3 [�0.5, 0.0)]; P � .05 and �2-
estimate 0.02 [0.0, 0.1]; P � .05). These results suggest
that men with short or long sleep duration have higher
baseline glucose levels, compared with those with average
sleep duration. The association was not confounded by
age, recruitment center, BMI, smoking, or physical activ-
ity. No significant associations were observed for BMI,
systolic BP, or levels of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.
In contrast, in women (Table 3), we observed an in-
verted U-shaped association between sleep duration and
fastingglucoselevels(inmmol/L, �-estimate0.3[0.1,0.5];
P � .02 and �2-estimate �0.02 [�0.1, 0.0]; P � .05) as
well a U-shaped association between sleep duration and
HDL levels (in mmol/L, �-estimate �0.2 [�0.4, �0.1];
P � .02 and �2-estimate 0.02 [0.0, 0.1]; P � .02). These
results suggest that women with short or long sleep dura-
tion have lower glucose levels and higher HDL levels,
compared with those with average sleep duration. The as-
sociation for glucose was not confounded by age, recruit-
ment center, BMI, smoking, or physical activity; however,
the association for HDL was. No significant associations
were observed for BMI, systolic BP, or levels of triglycerides.
Discussion
The aim of our current study was to evaluate the cross-
sectional association of sleep duration with insulin sensi-
tivity and �-cell function in the EGIR-RISC study. The
studywasconductedinalarge,middle-aged,andclinically
healthy group of men and women. We observed sex-spe-
cific associations: when compared with average sleep du-
ration, in men, short and long sleep duration were asso-
ciated with worse insulin sensitivity, whereas in women,
short and long sleep duration were associated with a better
insulin sensitivity as well as better �-cell function. These
findings were supported by the fasting glucose levels:
when compared with average sleep duration, in men, the
fasting glucose levels were higher for short and long
sleep duration, in contrast to women, who had lower

 levels. Our results suggest that compared with average
sleep duration, short or long sleep duration have dele-
terious effects in healthy men, whereas in women, short
and long sleep duration are associated with better glu-
cose metabolism.
When comparing our results to the literature, it is strik-
ing that most studies that use diabetes or markers of dia-
betesasendpoints,didnottestforinteractioneffectsofsex
or included only men or only women (3–5). Our sex-spe-
cific findings are consistent with earlier experimental and
epidemiological studies that did stratify by sex (7, 15, 16,
30–34), showing a stronger effect of short sleep in men,
compared with women. We are, however, the first to show
opposite effects in men and women. This might be due to
the type of cohort studied: we investigated healthy adults,
whereas previous studies included population-based co-
horts or cohorts of people at risk for diabetes. The only
other cohort that studied healthy participants, however,
showed no effect of sex on the association between sleep
duration and glucose and did not study insulin sensitivity
or �-cell function (32). A second explanation for these
differences is that we measured insulin sensitivity using
a standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and
OGTT, which has not been done before in a large co-
hort. Third, we measured sleep duration using an ac-
celerometer, whereas most studies used self-reported
data. Although there is an association between these
measures of sleep duration, the 2 measures are not in-
terchangeable (23).
In contrast to studies on diabetes or markers of diabetes
as endpoints, studies with other endpoints did show sex-
specific effects of sleep curtailment. For example, Knutson
(35)showedanegativeeffectofshortsleeponBMIinmen,
but not in women. Additionally, an intervention study
showed sleep loss to result in differential effects on in-
flammatory factors between the sexes (36). The mecha-

 nisms behind these sex differences are unknown but could
entail differences in sleep apnoea, slow wave sleep (SWS)
(thedeepersubstageofthesleepcycle),orcircadianclocks.
Men are more often affected by sleep apnoea, reducing
sleep quantity and quality, including SWS. SWS is thought
to be the most “restorative” sleep stage and deprivation of
SWS results in insulin resistance and reduced glucose tol-
erance (37). Women have a larger percentage of SWS per
hour of sleep when compared with men (38), which might
explain why sleep curtailment is more deleterious in men.

 Additionally, central and peripheral circadian clocks co-
ordinate the temporal relationships between sleep-wake
behaviors, feeding cycles and metabolic rhythms, includ-
ing glucose homeostasis. Disruption of the circadian clock
impairs glucose metabolism (39) and women have a
phase-advanced rhythm (40). This makes women less
prone to disturbance of the circadian rhythm and there-
fore it may protect them against the sex dependent dele-
terious effects of sleep curtailment. Overall, these results
suggest that women are protected against the negative ef-
fect of sleep curtailment on insulin sensitivity and �-cell
function. However, more research is needed to elucidate
these potential mechanisms.
Although our data are cross-sectional, we propose that
the current findings contribute to the knowledge on the role
of sleep duration in the development of diabetes, namely via
lossofinsulinsensitivityand�-cellfunction.Intheliterature,
several other pathways mediating this association have been
proposed, first sleep curtailment deregulates appetite and
physical activity (9). Aside from alterations in health behav-
iors, curtailed sleep could also affect glucose metabolism via
several physiologic pathways, such as the hyperactivation of
thehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenalaxisandautonomicner-
voussystem(2).Unfortunately,wedonothavedatatostudy
this; however, proxy measurements of these systems (ie, BP)
were not associated with sleep duration. Finally, a recent
experimental study by Rao et al showed a role for nonest-
erified fatty acid levels in the decrease of whole body insulin
sensitivity after sleep restriction (16). In general, it is believed
that all these different pathways add up to in insulin insen-
sitivity and loss of �-cell function. However, future studies
need to include measures of these potential pathways.
Our study has several limitations that need to be dis-
cussed. First, no information was available on other sleep
related measures that could affect insulin sensitivity and
�-cell function, such as shift work, low sleep quality, use
of sleep medication, or sleep apnoea, although we correct
for a proxy of sleep apnoea, namely BMI. Second, we
estimated sleep duration based on the time the accelerom-
eter was not worn for 1 hour, and although this is not a
standard method, we validated this using questionnaire
data (23). Third, the proportion of healthier participants
was higher among the participants with sleep data com-
pared with those without, thus, selection bias might be
present, indicating a potential underestimation of the ef-
fect of sleep duration on insulin sensitivity and �-cell func-
tion. Fourth, in women, we observed an association be-
tween sleep duration and insulin sensitivity derived from
sampling during an OGTT, but not with the hyperinsu-
linemic-euglycemic clamp. This might be due to the fact
the OGTT derived measures are likely to combine mea-
sures of both hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity as well
as incretin effects, compared with the clamp only measur-
ing muscle insulin sensitivity. Finally, our data were cross-
sectional, and thus, no causal inferences could be made.
Future longitudinal studies are warranted to further ex-
plore the associations between sleep duration, insulin sen-
sitivity, and �-cell function.
Our study also had several strengths. First, the assess-
ment of sleep duration in relation to several different in-
dicators of insulin sensitivity and �-cell function, includ-
ing insulin sensitivity assessed according to the gold
standard, the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, which
was conducted in a large group of participants. Second,

 the inclusion of only healthy participants: although data
on such populations are scarce, they are of interest because
they show the association without potential confounding
from comorbidities. Third, we used linear models to ex-
plore the aforementioned associations. This is in contrast
to most studies where arbitrary thresholds were assigned
to define short and long sleep duration. Finally, sleep du-
ration was assessed with an accelerometer and therefore
less prone to bias, compared with self-reported measures
(41). Overall, our current findings contribute to the
knowledge on the role of sleep duration in the develop-
ment of diabetes, namely via disturbances of insulin sen-
sitivity and �-cell function.
From our current study, we conclude that sleep dura-
tion is associated with insulin sensitivity and �-cell func-
tion in a sex-specific manner in clinically healthy people.
Prospective studies are needed to study the temporal
associations.
