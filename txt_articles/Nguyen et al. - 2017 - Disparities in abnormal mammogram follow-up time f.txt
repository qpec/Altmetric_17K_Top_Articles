BACKGROUND: Delays in abnormal mammogram follow-up contribute to poor outcomes. In the current study, the authors examined
differences in abnormal screening mammogram follow-up between non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Asian women. METHODS: The
authors used a prospective cohort of NHW and Asian women with a Breast Imaging, Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) abnormal
result of category 0 or 3-plus in the San Francisco Mammography Registry between 2000 and 2010. Kaplan-Meier estimation for the
median number of days to follow-up with a diagnostic radiologic test was performed, and the authors compared the percentage of
women with follow-up at 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days and no follow-up at 1 year for Asian women overall (and Asian ethnic
groups) and NHW women. In addition, the authors assessed the relationship between race/ethnicity and time to follow-up with
adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Among Asian women, Vietnamese and Filipina women had the longest, and
Japanese women the shortest, median follow-up (32 days, 28 days, and 19 days, respectively) compared with NHW women (15 days).
The percentage of women receiving follow-up at 30 days was lower for Asians versus NHWs (57% vs 77%; P<.0001), and these dis-
parities persisted at 60 days and 90 days for all Asian ethnic groups except Japanese. Asian women had a reduced hazard of follow-
up compared with NHW women (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.72). Asian women also had a higher
rate of receiving no follow-up compared with NHW women (15% vs 10%; P<.001); among Asian ethnic groups, Filipinas were found to
have the highest percentage of women with no follow-up (18.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Asian women, particularly Filipina and Vietnamese
women, were less likely than NHW women to receive timely follow-up after an abnormal screening mammogram. Research should disag-
gregate Asian ethnicity to better understand and address barriers to effective cancer prevention. Cancer 2017;123:3468-75. V

INTRODUCTION
Screening for breast cancer contributes to reduced morbidity and mortality when women receive appropriate follow-up
and treatment.1 Delays in breast cancer diagnosis because of a lack of evaluation of an abnormal screening mammogram
may impact prognosis because it can be associated with larger tumor size, advanced stage of disease, and poorer survival.2,3
Although there is no consensus regarding a clinical or research definition of timely follow-up, and prior studies have used
varying definitions, numerous studies have demonstrated that African American and Latina women are less likely than
white women to receive appropriate follow-up after an abnormal mammogram result.4-9 Fewer studies have included
Asian women; those that have suggested a similar disparity in follow-up.6,10,11 However, to the best of our knowledge,
none of these studies has examined follow-up for distinct Asian populations.
Asians are one of the fastest growing immigrant groups in the United States; by 2060, the projected number of US
residents who will identify as Asian or Asian with another race will comprise 48.6 million individuals, or 11.7% of the
total population, which represents a 143.1% increase from this population in 2014.12 Despite this large and growing
Asian population in the United States, many population-based breast cancer studies do not include Asians, and those that
do report them as a single aggregated group.13-15 Studies that disaggregate Asian Americans have demonstrated significant
intragroup variations in breast cancer incidence and mortality. For example, breast cancer incidence rates differ markedly
across distinct ethnic subpopulations of US Asian women, with differences of approximately 3-fold noted between

 subgroups with the highest rate (Japanese: 126 per
100,000 population) and the lowest rate (Laotian: 44 per
100,000 population).16 In addition, US-born Chinese
and Filipino women aged <55 years have higher breast
cancer incidence rates than non-Hispanic white (NHW)
women of comparable age.17
The San Francisco Mammography Registry (SFMR)
provides a unique opportunity to study the relationship
between breast cancer screening and related outcomes in
multiple Asian populations. The SFMR is a population-
based registry that records breast imaging tests for women
and contains information regarding a large number of
NHW and Asian women in the San Francisco Bay Area, a
geographic region with substantial diversity in the Asian
ethnic groups living in the United States. The objective of
this investigation was to compare follow-up after an
abnormal mammogram result requiring diagnostic radi-
ology among NHW women and diverse Asian American
ethnic women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Sample
The sample for the current study was obtained from the
SFMR, which is a participating member in the National
Cancer Institute’s Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium
(http://breastscreening.cancer.gov). The registry includes
participating radiology facilities that prospectively collect
demographic and clinical data from women at the time of
breast imaging and at each subsequent imaging visit. The
study sample included women with a Breast Imaging,
Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) result indicating
the need for further diagnostic imaging. This included
women with imaging results reported as BI-RADS cate-
gory 0 (indeterminate, needs additional imaging) and cat-
egory 3-plus (most likely benign with a recommendation
for immediate further diagnostic imaging) between 2000
and 2010, who did not opt out of participation in the
SFMR. We selected all Asian and NHW women aged 40
to 80 years at the 10 SFMR facilities with both substantial
Asian and NHW populations (>5%); 2 SFMR facilities
did not meet this population criteria (<5% NHW indi-
viduals in each) and were excluded. The remaining 10
facilities had populations that ranged from 9.3% to
43.6% Asian. For any given woman, we included only the
first abnormal screening mammogram result in the
SFMR.
Study Variables
Our independent variables were self-reported race (NHW
and Asian) and Asian ethnicity. Asian ethnicity included
Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Vietnamese, other Asian, and
mixed Asian. “Other Asian” included Thai, Cambodian,
and other Southeast Asians who were represented in the
SFMR in small numbers. Mixed Asians were those indi-
viduals who reported Asian race/ethnicity and at least 1
other race/ethnicity (NHW, black, or Hispanic). We
excluded women with a history of breast cancer because
follow-up procedures for abnormal results likely differ
between women without breast cancer and cancer survi-
vors. The current study was approved by the University of
California at San Francisco, Committee on Human
Subjects.
We chose covariates measures based on clinical rele-
vance, data availability, and published research. Patient
demographic factors collected by the registry at the time
of the index mammogram and obtained for analyses
included self-reported age (by decade), educational level
(<high school, high school diploma or General Educa-
tional Development diploma, some college/technical
school, and college or postcollege graduate), family his-
tory of breast cancer in a first-degree relative (yes/no), and
year of the index abnormal mammogram (2000-2010).
Our primary outcome variable was time to follow-
up. We defined follow-up as a diagnostic radiologic study
(mammogram or ultrasound) performed at any SFMR
facility subsequent to the index abnormal mammogram.
Our previous work has indicated that the majority of
women in the SFMR have radiologic follow-up for BI-
RADS categories of 0 or 3-plus within 60 days.18 How-
ever, because to our knowledge there is not a clear clinical
or research consensus regarding how best to define timely
follow-up for these results,9 we examined multiple follow-
up outcomes (time-to-followup; percentage with follow-
up by 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days; and percentage with
no follow-up at 1 year) and compare them across racial
and ethnic groups. Together these outcomes contribute to
our understanding of timely care and differences across
groups. We chose these cutoff values based on the distri-
bution of events in our data, and the documented clinical
impact of a 3-month delay in diagnosis and treatment.3
We examined follow-up until 1 year to ensure that we
were able to capture all possible additional follow-up after
90 days and before the next potential screening interval.
Statistical Analyses
Comparisons of demographic and clinical variables
between NHW and Asian women were performed using
the chi-square test for categorical variables and the Stu-
dent t test for continuous variables. Similar analyses were
conducted to assess differences among Asian subgroups

 (Asian ethnic analyses). All reported P values are 2-sided,
and statistical significance was defined as P < .05. In the
absence of competing risks, Kaplan-Meier analysis can be
used to estimate the cumulative probability of an event
over time. We calculated the median number of days
from an index abnormal examination to radiologic
follow-up, along with interquartile ranges using the
Kaplan-Meier method and compared groups using the
log-rank test. The percentages of women who received
follow-up by 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days were calcu-
lated by race and Asian ethnicity; group differences were
assessed using the chi-square test.
Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards
models examined the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% con-
fidence intervals (95% CIs) of receipt of radiologic
follow-up within 365 days of an index mammogram. The
outcome of interest was time to follow-up, calculated as
the number of days from the date of the index abnormal
mammogram to the first known follow-up study. We cen-
sored the maximum follow-up time at 365 days for index
mammograms because a mammogram subsequent to that
may have been another screening mammogram rather
than a follow-up to the index abnormal result. The pro-
portional hazards assumption in the baseline covariates
was verified by examining the scaled Schoenfeld residuals
and diagnostic plots.19 We stratified by mammography
facility to account for variations in time to follow-up
among facilities; with stratification, the proportional haz-
ards assumption was not violated. Separate models were
fitted comparing NHW and Asian women overall and
NHW and Asian women by Asian ethnic group; both
models were adjusted for age, educational level, family
history of breast cancer, year of index mammogram, and
mammography facility (as described above). An adjusted
HR (aHR) < 1.0 indicates that the instantaneous “risk” of
achieving follow-up for the members of the comparison
group is less compared with that for the reference group of
NHW women. Data were analyzed using SAS statistical
software (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
A total of 50,970 NHW and Asian women who met the
inclusion criteria for the current study were identified dur-
ing the 10-year study period (2000-2010). We excluded
individuals with missing information regarding educa-
tional level (1249 women; 2.5%) and family history (363
women; 0.7%), leaving a final sample of 49,358 women.
The majority (65%) clustered within 3 of 10 facilities
with high screening mammography volumes (not shown).
Table 1 demonstrates that 30% of the women in the
sample were Asian (14,818 women). The predominant
Asian ethnic group represented was Chinese, which com-
prised 16.4% of the total sample, followed by 6.8% for
Filipina, 1.4% for other Asian, 1.8% for Japanese, 2.4%
for mixed Asian, and 1.1% for Vietnamese. The mean age
of all the women was 53.9 years. On average, Asian
women were slightly younger than NHW women (52.9
years vs 54.3 years; P < .00001). Japanese women were
found to be the oldest among the Asian ethnic groups
(average age, 55.2 years) and Vietnamese and women clas-
sified as other Asian were the youngest (average age, 50
years). NHW women had a statistically significantly
higher percentage of college graduates than Asian women
(68.4% vs 43.8%). Among Asian women, Japanese and
Filipina women had the highest percentage of college
graduates (60.4% and 57.9%, respectively), whereas Viet-
namese women had the lowest percentage (18.2%). A
higher percentage of NHW women reported a positive
family history of breast cancer compared with Asian
women (17% vs 10%; P < .00001). Approximately 12%
of women classified as Japanese, Filipina, and other Asian
reported a positive family history of breast cancer, whereas
only 5.2% of Vietnamese women did (P < .00001).
Table 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier median time to
follow-up by race and Asian ethnicity as well as the per-
centage of participants receiving follow-up for different
time intervals. Overall, the median duration of follow-up
from the time of the index mammogram to first follow-up
was 18 days. Asian women overall had a substantially
higher median follow-up time compared with NHW
women (26 days vs 15 days; P < .00001). The median
follow-up differed significantly by Asian ethnicity: Viet-
namese women had the longest follow-up followed by Fil-
ipina and Chinese women, whereas Japanese women had
the shortest follow-up, which approached that for NHW
women. Table 2 also shows the percentage of women who
received follow-up within 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days
by race and Asian ethnicity. At the 30-day follow-up inter-
val, approximately 76.9% of NHW women were recorded
as having received follow-up compared with 57.1% of
Asian women overall (P < .0001). Among Vietnamese
and Filipina women, only approximately one-half of the
women in each ethnic group received follow-up at 30 days
(49.1% and 53%, respectively), and follow-up rates at 90
days remained lower for these groups compared with all
the others. The overall prevalence of women in the
sample who did not receive follow-up within 1 year after
an index abnormal mammogram was 11.3% (5567
women). Compared with NHW women, Asian women
had a higher percentage of no follow-up (15% vs 10%;

 P < .001), and among Asian ethnic groups, Filipina
women were found to have the highest percentage of no
follow-up (18.1%).
Table 3 shows the results of the adjusted Cox pro-
portional hazards modeling. Asian women were found to
be significantly less likely to receive timely follow-up com-
pared with NHW women (aHR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69-
0.72). When comparing Asian ethnic groups with NHW
women, although all groups were less likely to achieve
follow-up, Filipina (aHR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.61-0.66) and
Vietnamese (aHR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.63-0.76) women
were found to have the lowest HR of achieving follow-up,
and Japanese women had the highest (aHR, 0.88; 95%
CI, 0.83-0.95 [P<.0001]).
DISCUSSION
The findings of the current study indicate that Asian eth-
nicity was associated with delays in follow-up imaging
after abnormal screening mammography, with a higher
percentage of Asian women having no follow-up at 1 year
compared with NHW women. These findings are consis-
tent with prior studies examining differences in time to
follow-up after an abnormal mammogram for other eth-
nic minorities.4,7,8 Prior studies of abnormal follow-up
that specifically included Asian women reported mixed
results, with 2 studies finding delays for Asian women
compared with NHW women and 1 study reporting no
difference.6,10,11 These studies differed with regard to
their definition of follow-up after an abnormal mammo-
gram. They also examined Asian women as a single aggre-
gated group, possibly masking the heterogeneity among
Asians, which may in turn have impacted the findings.
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is
the first to examine follow-up outcomes after an abnormal
mammogram by Asian ethnic group. Although we found
wide variation in follow-up percentages among Asian
American groups, they all had a lower percentage of
follow-up compared with NHW women, varying from
12% to 36% lower, with Filipinas and Vietnamese
women having the lowest percentages. Only Japanese
women had percentages close to those of white women by
90 days after the abnormal mammogram. It is interesting
to note that except for Japanese women, all women in the
Asian ethnic groups appeared to have a high percentage of
having received no follow-up at 1 year, ranging from
12.8% to 18.1%.
There are several potential explanations for the
observed lower rate of follow-up. Asian subgroups vary
widely with regard to socioeconomic status (SES), regular
access to a health care provider, and acculturation, includ-
ing limited English proficiency (LEP), all of which may
influence

 mammogram result. Women from lower socioeconomic
backgrounds often do not have access to early detection
and are less likely to have timely and complete follow-up
after an abnormal screening test.9 Differential patterns of
immigration and acculturation have resulted in certain
groups, such as Vietnamese Americans, being more likely
to lack health coverage and to have LEP and lower SES
compared with other groups, such as Japanese Ameri-
cans.20 In a previous study, we found that having LEP was
associated with receiving care at a mammography facility
with longer follow-up times. Even at facilities with short
follow-up times, women with LEP were more likely to
experience delays in follow-up compared with English
speakers.18 Communication factors, including a woman’s
understanding of follow-up care, is associated with the
receipt of adequate follow-up of an abnormal mammo-
gram result.21 Language barriers can impede compre-
hension of the clinical care process and affect timely
adherence to recommendations. Karliner et al found that
Asian women, particularly Chinese-speaking women, did
not fully understand their physicians’ reports concerning
their mammograms.22 A more recent analysis by Perez-
Stable et al of a multiethnic sample of women demon-
strated that those who did not fully understand their
abnormal mammogram results were more likely to experi-
ence delays in follow-up care.6 Although the use of profes-
sional
interpreters
has
been
shown
to
enhance
communication and outcomes for patients with LEP,23
many providers report “getting by” without their use.24,25
Furthermore, mammography result notification letters
are written in English and at levels too difficult for many
patients to understand.22,26
In addition, other health care delivery and commu-
nication issues not directly related to a language barrier
might affect a woman’s follow-up behavior. For example,
primary care is associated with better follow-up outcomes;
however, disadvantaged Asian groups have been found to
be less likely to have a regular primary care provider.5,20
In addition, Asian individuals report a lack of trust in their
health care provider, low satisfaction with their health
care, and perceived discrimination or disrespect by pro-
viders,27-29 all of which may increase their risk of not
receiving timely follow-up after an abnormal mammo-
gram. To the best of our knowledge, the specific commu-
nication and health care delivery experiences of Asian
women during the diagnostic mammography process, the
extent to which they differ by Asian ethnicity and English
language proficiency, and how these may influence
follow-up after an abnormal mammogram is unknown.
Although cultural barriers to mammography among
different Asian ethnic groups, including lack of preven-
tion orientation, cultural beliefs and stigma regarding
breast cancer and screening, and modesty and embarrass-
ment, are known to reduce screening mammography for
these groups,30-32 to our knowledge it is unknown
whether these same factors affect follow-up. Other
patient-related factors previously explored for women in
general are psychosocial barriers, including fear of pain
associated with follow-up examinations, cancer fatalism,
anxiety while waiting for diagnostic results, and coping
strategies.33-35 For example, some Asian groups perceive a
diagnosis of cancer as a “death sentence.”36 Future studies
designed specifically to understand factors associated with
follow-up behaviors among diverse Asian women with
abnormal mammogram results should incorporate cul-
tural, psychosocial, and potentially protective factors as
well as patient differences and similarities among different
Asian ethnic groups, and how those factors influence
follow-up outcomes.
System-related barriers including delayed notifica-
tion of results, scheduling delays, and difficulty in obtain-
ing an appointment have been found to be salient factors
in the follow-up of breast abnormalities for women in
general.37,38 Difficulties navigating the health care system,
such as scheduling problems, contribute to a woman’s
delayed follow-up.9 Furthermore, geographic proximity
of the breast cancer services and mammography facilities
involved in follow-up care can impact timely care, partic-
ularly among disadvantaged Asian women.39 Organiza-
tional processes such as information systems (including
mail and telephone reminder systems for patients and pro-
viders), the availability of interpreter services, and patient
navigator programs enhance follow-up care, especially
among Asians and women with LEP.40 Although in the
current study the findings were adjusted for the mammog-
raphy facility, it may be that more disadvantaged Asian
women are receiving care at mammography facilities with
more barriers; the impact of these system-level factors on
these disparities in care deserves further study.
The current study has some limitations. First, our
use of existing data restricted us to those variables that
were available; we were unable to assess some potentially
relevant factors, including breast symptoms and prior
mammograms as well as acculturation, language, and
length of time in the United States, that may mediate the
relationship between Asian ethnicity and receipt of
follow-up care. Another study limitation is that the study
population resided only in northern California, thereby
potentially limiting its generalizability to Asians living in

 other geographic areas. However, it is the diversity and
relatively high population concentration of Asian ethnic
groups living in northern California that allowed us to
conduct the current study. Finally, although we were able
to adjust for educational attainment, we were unable to
examine other SES factors that might vary among
Asian ethnic groups and influence the receipt of timely
follow-up.
Despite these limitations, the current study has sev-
eral strengths. We used a population-based registry of
women undergoing mammography with a representative
sample of women receiving screening mammography in
community practice. To our knowledge, these data repre-
sent the largest available screening mammography data
among Asian women. The study sample consisted of a
large percentage of Asian Americans (30%) and a repre-
sentative sample of 6 different Asian groups, thereby
allowing statistically valid conclusions regarding group
comparisons.
Conclusions
The findings of the current study indicate disparities in
follow-up after an abnormal mammogram requiring
radiologic follow-up for Asian women compared with
NHW women. These findings have implications for
future research. First, this work emphasizes the substantial
differences in follow-up care between different Asian eth-
nic groups, and reinforces the need for disaggregation of
ethnicity in population health studies. Second, heteroge-
neous findings across Asian ethnic groups underscore the
importance of further research into the correlates of
follow-up for Asian women, including patient, provider,
and system-level characteristics. Future investigations,
particularly among high-risk Asian ethnic groups, are
needed to understand the breast cancer care experience of
Asian women to identify and develop culturally and lin-
guistically appropriate strategies to improve the timely
follow-up for these populations.
