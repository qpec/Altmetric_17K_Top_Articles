ABSTRACT
Candida auris, a new multidrug-resistant Candida spp. which is associ-
ated with invasive infection and high rates of mortality, has recently emerged. Here,
we determined the virulence factors (germination, adherence, biofilm formation,
phospholipase and proteinase production) of 16 C. auris isolates and their suscepti-
bilities to 11 drugs belonging to different antifungal classes, including a novel orally
bioavailable 1,3-�-D-glucan synthesis inhibitor (SCY-078). We also examined the ef-
fect of SCY-078 on the growth, ultrastructure, and biofilm-forming abilities of C. au-
ris. Our data showed that while the tested strains did not germinate, they did
produce phospholipase and proteinase in a strain-dependent manner and had a
significantly reduced ability to adhere and form biofilms compared to that of
Candida albicans (P � 0.01). C. auris isolates demonstrated reduced susceptibility
to fluconazole and amphotericin B, while, in general, they were susceptible to
the remaining drugs tested. SCY-078 had an MIC90 of 1 mg/liter against C. auris
and caused complete inhibition of the growth of C. auris and C. albicans. Scan-
ning electron microscopy analysis showed that SCY-078 interrupted C. auris cell
division, with the organism forming abnormal fused fungal cells. Additionally,
SCY-078 possessed potent antibiofilm activity, wherein treated biofilms demon-
strated significantly reduced metabolic activity and a significantly reduced thick-
ness compared to the untreated control (P � 0.05 for both comparisons). Our
study shows that C. auris expresses several virulence determinants (albeit to a
lesser extent than C. albicans) and is resistant to fluconazole and amphotericin B.
SCY-078, the new orally bioavailable antifungal, had potent antifungal/antibiofilm
activity against C. auris, indicating that further evaluation of this antifungal is
warranted.

 United Kingdom and, more recently, in Venezuela, Colombia, and the United States (2,
4–12). Of these C. auris infections, the majority have been secondary nosocomial
infections (4, 9, 12, 13). A high percentage of clinical C. auris strains demonstrate
resistance to fluconazole and show variable resistance to other antifungals belonging
to the three major classes of clinically available antifungals (azoles, polyenes, echino-
candins), thereby limiting treatment options (1, 3–6, 9–16).
To gain insight into this emerging Candida species, investigators conducted
studies to characterize its virulence factors (e.g., phospholipase, proteinase, ability
to form biofilms) (8, 17). Although these studies are informative, they examined
only a limited number of C. auris strains. Here we studied 16 different C. auris
isolates obtained from patients in Japan, India, South Korea, and Germany and (i)
characterized their morphology and virulence factors (those that have been de-
scribed for Candida species, particularly Candida albicans, e.g., germination, adher-
ence, biofilm formation, and phospholipase and proteinase production), (ii) deter-
mined their susceptibilities to 11 antifungals belonging to different antifungal
classes, including a novel orally bioavailable 1,3-�-D-glucan synthesis inhibitor
(SCY-078) with demonstrated activity against multidrug-resistant Candida spp., and
(iii) evaluated the effect of SCY-078 on the growth, ultrastructure, and biofilm-
forming ability of C. auris (18).
RESULTS
C. auris does not form chlamydospores. C. auris failed to form chlamydospores
after growth on cornmeal agar for 3 days at 30°
C. In contrast, C. albicans ATCC 14053
(the positive control) produced chlamydospores on cornmeal agar (data not shown).
Virulence factors. Our data showed that the C. auris strains tested did not germi-
nate when incubated with fetal bovine serum. In contrast, C. albicans ATCC 14053
germinated profusely (�90% within 2 h). Moreover, the evaluation of adherence using
two representative C. auris isolates (MRL 31102 and MRL 31103) revealed that the C.
auris strains exhibited a significantly reduced ability to adhere to catheter material
compared to C. albicans (P � 0.05) (Fig. 1).
The tested C. auris strains produced phospholipase and proteinase in a strain-
dependent manner. As shown in Table 1, 37.5% of the tested C. auris strains (6/16
isolates) possessed phospholipase activity and 64% (9/14 isolates) tested positive for
FIG 1 Comparison of adherence of C. auris strains. The ability of Candida species to adhere to a silicon
elastomer catheter as a representative substrate was assessed. Cells were allowed to adhere to silicone
elastomer discs, washed, and overlaid with Sabouraud dextrose agar, and the number of CFU adhering
to the substrate was counted after incubation at 37°
C for 18 to 24 h. The number of adherent C. auris
cells was significantly less than that for C. albicans (positive control) (P � 0.01). *, P value compared to

 secreted proteinase activity (19). The level of proteinase production by the 9 strains
ranged from 1.2 to 5.3 ng/ml (Table 1).
Analysis of biofilm formation by C. auris MRL 31102 and MRL 31103 demonstrated
that the biofilms were mainly composed of yeast cells adhering to catheter material
(Fig. 2B and C). In contrast, C. albicans SC5314 showed a highly heterogeneous
architecture of biofilms with yeast cells and hyphae embedded within the extracellular
matrix (Fig. 2A). Moreover, C. auris biofilms, unlike C. albicans biofilms, had a limited
amount of extracellular matrix. Furthermore, the thickness of C. auris biofilms was
significantly less than that of C. albicans biofilms (range, 21 to 26 �m for C. auris
biofilms versus 50 �m for C. albicans biofilms; P � 0.05) (Fig. 2D to G). Biofilm
quantitation on the basis of metabolic activity and biomass revealed that the C. auris
isolates tested (n � 15) formed significantly less biofilm than C. albicans SC5314 (Fig. 3A
and B) (P � 0.05 for both comparisons).
C. auris growth is similar to C. albicans growth. Growth curve analysis of the
control C. auris and C. albicans isolates showed that the two Candida species had similar
growth patterns, reaching stationary phase within approximately 20 h (Fig. 4). The
doubling times for C. albicans SC5314, C. auris MRL 31102, and C. auris MRL 31103 were
101.22 � 5.26, 105.62 � 12.83, and 107.00 � 7.14 min, respectively (mean � standard
deviation [SD]; P � 0.05 for all comparisons).
Antifungal susceptibility profile of C. auris. As shown in Table 2, the MIC90 of
SCY-078 was 1 mg/liter, which was similar to the MIC90 of caspofungin (CAS) and
micafungin (MFG) (1 mg/liter for both) and within 2 dilutions of the MIC90 of anidula-
fungin (AFG; 0.25 mg/liter). The MIC90 of SCY-078 was also similar to that of flucytosine
(5FC; MIC90 � 1 mg/liter) and lower than that of amphotericin B (AMB; MIC90 � 4
mg/liter). Antifungal susceptibility testing of azoles showed that isavuconazole (ISA)
was the most active agent tested (MIC90 � 0.125 mg/liter), followed by posaconazole
(POS; MIC90 � 0.5 mg/liter), itraconazole (ITC; MIC90 � 1 mg/liter), and voriconazole
(VRC; MIC90 � 2 mg/liter), while fluconazole (FLC) was the least active azole (MIC90 �
64 mg/liter) against the tested isolates (Table 3).
SCY-078 inhibits the growth of C. auris and C. albicans. Having shown that C.
auris had low MIC values of SCY-078, we examined the ability of this drug to inhibit the
growth of this yeast. Exposure of C. auris and C. albicans to SCY-078 (at concentrations
ranging from 0.25 to 8 mg/liter) led to the complete inhibition of growth of this
pathogenic fungus (Fig. 4).
SCY-078 disrupted the ultrastructure of C. auris. We used scanning electron
microscopy to determine the effect of SCY-078 on the ultrastructure of C. auris. As can

 be seen in Fig. 5A, untreated control C. auris cells had a well-defined, oval-shaped yeast
morphology as well as several budding cells. In contrast, cells exposed to SCY-078 (at
a concentration of 1� MIC [0.5 mg/liter]) exhibited a severely distorted yeast cell
topography with cells fused together, indicating that the cells were unable to divide
(Fig. 5B).
SCY-078 possesses activity against C. auris biofilms. Resistance to antifungals is
a hallmark phenotype of biofilms. To determine whether SCY-078 possesses antibiofilm
activity, we exposed mature-phase C. auris biofilms to a range of drug concentrations
(0.5, 2, and 4 mg/liter). Metabolic activity and confocal scanning laser microscopy data
showed that SCY-078 reduced C. auris biofilms significantly at all concentrations tested
(P � 0.05) (Fig. 6) (19). Unlike untreated cells, which showed an intense green fluores-
cence (resulting from concanavalin A [ConA] binding to polysaccharides), C. auris
biofilms treated with SCY-078 showed yeast cells with reduced fluorescence, particu-
larly at an SCY-078 concentration of 4 mg/liter (Fig. 6D and H). Additionally, at all tested
drug concentrations, the metabolic activity and thickness of the biofilms were reduced
significantly compared to those for untreated control biofilms (P � 0.05) (Fig. 6I and J).
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we examined 16 different C. auris isolates obtained from
different parts of the world; characterized the major Candida virulence factors (includ-
ing germination, adherence, biofilm formation, and phospholipase and proteinase

 production); determined their susceptibilities to 11 drugs belonging to different anti-
fungal classes, including a novel orally bioavailable 1,3-�-D-glucan synthesis inhibitor
(SCY-078); and evaluated the effect of SCY-078 on the growth, morphology, and
ultrastructure of C. auris and its ability to form biofilms.
Germination, adherence, phospholipase and proteinase production, and biofilm
formation are major virulence factors known to contribute to Candida pathogenesis
and have been well characterized in C. albicans by a number of investigators, including
our group (20–24). Few studies have investigated these virulence factors in C. auris, and
those that have been conducted have been limited to strains from a single geograph-
ical areas or have focused on one strain (7, 17). Our data showed that C. auris, unlike
C. albicans, is devoid of the ability to germinate, form hyphae, or produce chlamy-
dospores. Our data confirm and extend the observations by others since we analyzed
isolates from different geographic regions (3, 4, 17). Additionally, we showed for the
first time that C. auris exhibits a minimal ability to adhere to silicone elastomer relative
to C. albicans. Since the ability of Candida to adhere to catheter surfaces is important
in causing catheter-associated candidiasis, the weak adherence ability of C. auris
suggests that it likely plays some role in catheter-associated candidiasis but not a large
one, in contrast to C. albicans and Candida parapsilosis, which are known to cause such
infections (25).

 Our findings demonstrated that C. auris phospholipase production was strain de-
pendent and that phospholipase production was detected in 37.5% of the isolates
tested. In general, the tested C. auris strains that produced this enzyme tended to have
weak phospholipase activity. Only one C. auris strain (CBS 12770) had phospholipase
activity comparable to that of C. albicans, a known high phospholipase producer (26).
Kumar et al. (17) recently reported the isolation of an azole-resistant C. auris strain from
a vulvovaginitis patient and showed that this strain exhibited strong phospholipase
activity (ratio of the colony diameter to the colony diameter plus the precipitation zone
[Pz] � 0.72), proteinase activity, and hemolysin activity. Ours is the first study to
demonstrate that the production of phospholipase by C. auris is strain dependent, with
the majority of isolates being non-phospholipase producers. In general, the number of
C. auris strains tested that produced secreted proteinase was higher than the number
that produced phospholipase (64% versus 37.5%, respectively). However, similar to the
ability to produce phospholipase, the ability of C. auris to produce secreted proteinase
was strain dependent. Interestingly, we observed that strains that were high proteinase
producers were not necessarily high phospholipase producers and vice versa (Table 1).
Our results showed that the tested C. auris strains had the ability to form
biofilms. However, these biofilms were significantly thinner than the biofilms

of the C. albicans biofilms). A variation in the ability of different C. auris strains to
form biofilms was noted, though these differences were not statistically significant.
Our results are in disagreement with those of Oh et al. (7), who tested 15 C. auris
isolates and reported that they did not produce biofilms. The differences between
our data and those of Oh et al. (7) could be attributed to the use of different media
and the fact that they did not use silicon elastomer as a substrate, nor did the
investigators treat the plastic surfaces with fetal bovine serum (27). Alternatively, all
the isolates used in the study of Oh et al. (7) were obtained from patients’ears,
while the strains used in this study were mostly from patients with disseminated
candidiasis. In addition, Oh et al. (7) used a semiquantitative subjective scale (range,

 negative result to a score of �5) to report biofilm formation, while we used three
separate quantitative measures (metabolic activity, dry weight, and biofilm thick-
ness).
In general, the ability of C. auris to express the various virulence factors is much
weaker than that of C. albicans, suggesting that this emerging species is not as virulent
as the latter species. Borman et al. (8) attempted to address the virulence of C. auris by
using a Galleria mellonella larva model. Their data showed that C. auris had the same
pathogenicity as C. albicans and C. tropicalis and was more virulent (P � 0.05) than
other Candida spp. (e.g., C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei). However, unpublished
data from our center confirm the poor ability of C. auris to infect and disseminate in
mice compared to C. albicans (data not shown). We showed that it is critical to
immunocompromise the mice and use a large inoculum (3 � 107 yeast cells/animal) to
successfully infect the mice (unpublished data). Therefore, our data suggest that the
multidrug-resistant phenotype of C. auris comes with a major fitness cost.
The clinical significance of C. auris appears to reside in its ability to develop
resistance to multiple commonly used antifungal agents, leading to infections with
high rates of mortality (2–6, 8, 9, 13–16). Therefore, the identification of agents that are
effective against this species is critical. Our data demonstrated that C. auris responded
differently to various antifungals. Among the azoles, all but one isolate showed reduced
susceptibility to fluconazole (MIC, �64 mg/liter), with the other azoles showing variable
antifungal activity and isavuconazole being the most active. The only isolate tested in
this study to have a low fluconazole MIC was CBS 10913, which, interestingly, was the
only strain isolated from a nonblood source (2). Additionally, caspofungin, micafungin,
and anidulafungin showed similar activities against the tested isolates. These findings
are in agreement with those of recent studies from other investigators, who also

 reported that C. auris isolates were generally resistant or less susceptible to azoles but
susceptible to echinocandins (2–6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16). Our finding that amphotericin B
demonstrated less activity against C. auris strains also agrees with those of others
reporting high MICs for this agent against C. auris (9, 16, 28). Our data show that the
C. auris isolates tested in our study exhibited multidrug resistance against fluconazole
and amphotericin B. Moreover, some isolates also exhibited high MIC values for
voriconazole and itraconazole.
To identify new antifungals that may be affective against C. auris, in this study we
tested SCY-078, a new 1,3-�-D-glucan synthesis inhibitor, which has been shown to
possess potent activity against various Candida spp. An added advantage of SCY-078 is
that it is the first orally bioavailable 1,3-�-D-glucan synthesis inhibitor (29). Our data
showed that SCY-078 has potent antifungal activity against the C. auris isolates tested.
Further, SCY-078 showed growth inhibition and antibiofilm activity against this emerg-
ing species. Moreover, C. auris cells exposed to SCY-078 exhibited a severely distorted
yeast cell topography and failed to divide. Other investigators showed that increasing
concentrations of caspofungin treatment altered the morphology of various Candida
species (30, 31). These authors showed that caspofungin treatment of cells affected the
morphology of Candida, resulting in cells with an increased size, a lack of distinct rings
around the budding site, and the absence of filamentation in C. albicans. Unlike
caspofungin, treatment with SCY-078 led to the inhibition of cell division, suggesting
that, in addition to the inhibition of 1,3-�-D-glucan synthesis, this drug may have a
separate target or may affect this enzyme through yet undefined unique interactions.
In summary, our study showed that C. auris expresses several virulence factors, albeit
to a lesser extent than C. albicans and in a strain-dependent manner. We demonstrated
that SCY-078 is a potent drug and could be an important addition to the antifungal
armamentarium to treat patients with infections caused by this multiresistant species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolates tested. The following C. auris strains were used in this study: 2 C. auris isolates (MRL 31102
and MRL 31103) obtained from a 68-year-old male enrolled in a recent candidemia trial at a German site
and 14 C. auris isolates from the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands (CBS
10913, CBS 12372, CBS 12373, CBS 12766 to CBS 12768, and CBS 12770 to CBS 12777) that were isolated
from patients living in Japan, India, and South Korea (Table 4). To identify the MRL 31102 and MRL 31103
isolates, we originally utilized the yeast identification tool API 20C AUX. However, we were unable to
identify the strains with a high percentage (�85%) of certainty. Moreover, since C. auris is also often
misidentified as Candida haemulonii, Candida famata, Candida sake, or Rhodotorula glutinis using typical
identification methods, including the API 20C AUX tool and the Vitek 2 system, we used DNA typing,
employing the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and ITS4 regions of the fungal ribosome (2–6, 12–15).
Identification was performed using a BLAST algorithm search against the sequences in the UNITE
database (32). This analysis allowed us to identify MRL 31102 and MRL 31103, which had 89 and 99%
homology with the C. auris strains in the UNITE database, respectively, as C. auris. In the current study,
two strains of C. albicans (SC5314 and ATCC 14053), obtained from the American Type Culture

 Collection (Manassas, VA), were used as comparators. C. albicans was selected as a comparator
because its virulence factors have been well characterized and it is responsible for nearly 50% of all
Candida infections.
Ability of C. auris to form chlamydospores. Since chlamydospores are utilized to help distinguish
fungal types (33), we evaluated the ability of the C. auris isolates to exhibit this morphotype. Briefly, an
isolated colony of C. auris was inoculated onto a cornmeal agar plate (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA)
to make a lawn. A coverslip was applied to the inoculated area in order to create microaerophilic
conditions, and the plate was incubated at 30°
C for 3 days with protection from light. The plate was
subsequently examined for chlamydospore formation under white light at a �20 magnification. C.
albicans ATCC 14053 was used as a positive control.
Characterization of C. auris virulence factors. The ability of Candida species to cause infection is
attributed to the possession of virulence factors, including the ability to germinate, adhere to host cells,
secrete extracellular enzymes such as phospholipase and proteinase, and form biofilms (18, 34, 35). To
date, the characterization of C. auris virulence factors is limited.
(i) Ability to germinate. The ability of C. auris to form germ tubes was assessed using the germ tube
test (36–38). Briefly, an isolated colony of C. auris, taken from a 24-h culture grown on potato-dextrose
agar (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA), was inoculated into 0.5 ml of fetal bovine serum (Fisher
Thermo Scientific, Cleveland, OH, USA) and incubated for 2 h at 37°
C. Next, 10 �l of fetal bovine serum
was then transferred onto a glass slide, a coverslip was added, and the slide was examined using
phase-contrast microscopy at a �20 magnification.
(ii) Adherence assay. The ability of Candida species to adhere to indwelling medical devices and
host tissues is a known virulence factor. Since silicon elastomer is used extensively in central venous
catheters, in this study, we evaluated the ability of C. auris isolates to adhere to silicon elastomer, which
was used as a representative catheter material.
To determine the ability of C. auris to adhere to silicon elastomer surfaces, yeast cells were inoculated
into 10 ml yeast nitrogen base broth (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) and incubated overnight at
37°
C. The cells were then washed twice with Hanks’buffered salt solution, adjusted to 5 � 103 cells/ml,
and further diluted to obtain a cell suspension of 250 cells/ml using the same buffer. Silicon elastomer
discs (diameter, 1.2 cm) were transferred to 12-well tissue culture plates, to which 2 ml of cell suspension
(prepared as described above) was added. Next, the plates were incubated at 37°
C for 30 min to allow
the cells to adhere to the discs. After incubation, discs containing adherent cells were transferred to a
fresh plate containing 2 ml Hanks’buffered salt solution. Subsequently, the discs were washed twice with
Hanks’ buffered salt solution and, following aspiration of the buffer, were overlaid with 3 ml of
Sabouraud dextrose agar (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA). The plates were incubated at 37°
C for 18
to 24 h, and the number of C. auris cells adhering to the catheter material was assessed by counting the
number of CFU.
(iii) Phospholipase assay. The ability of the C. auris strains to secrete phospholipase was determined
using a phospholipase activity assay that employed Sabouraud dextrose agar as a medium supple-
mented with 58.4 g/liter NaCl, 5.5 g/liter CaCl2, and 10% egg yolk emulsion (30% stock; Hi-Media, India)
as previously described (26, 39). Medium without egg yolk was sterilized at 121°
C for 15 min and cooled
to 50°
C. Egg yolk emulsion was then added, and the agar was dispensed into petri dishes (20 ml/plate).
A 10-�l aliquot containing 1 � 107 yeast cells/ml was added to the center of the plates, and the plates
were incubated at 37°
C for 5 days. Following incubation, the production of phospholipase (indicated by
the appearance of a whitish zone of precipitation around the yeast colony) was assessed by measuring
the ratio of the colony diameter to the colony diameter plus the precipitation zone (the Pz value). Pz
values of �0.89, 0.90 to 0.99, and 1 indicate strong, weak, and no phospholipase activity, respectively
(26).
(iv) Proteinase assay. Proteinase activity assays were performed using a protease fluorescent
detection kit (catalog number PF0100; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the manu-
facturer’
s specifications (40). The C. auris strains were cultured in 20 ml yeast nitrogen base for 48
h. Following incubation, the supernatant containing secreted proteinases was concentrated, and the
volumes were adjusted to the proportion of the total number of CFU. Subsequently, 10 �l of the
normalized protein-rich supernatants was tested for proteinase activity using the kit described
above.
(v) Biofilm formation. The ability of Candida to form biofilms has been linked to catheter-associated
infections. Therefore, we evaluated whether C. auris can produce biofilms using our in vitro biofilm model
as described previously (19). In the current study, we used silicone elastomer as a substrate for biofilm
formation since catheters are commonly constructed using this material and silicone elastomer has been
used as a substrate in numerous studies investigating catheter-associated biofilms performed by our
group and others (41–51). Briefly, silicone elastomer discs (diameter, 1.2 cm) were placed in 12-well tissue
culture plates and incubated in fetal bovine serum at 37°
C on a rocker for 24 h. The discs were then
removed from the fetal bovine serum, immersed in a 4-ml cell suspension with a concentration of 1 �
107 cells/ml, and incubated for 90 min at 37°
C (adhesion phase). Subsequently, the discs were transferred
to 4 ml yeast nitrogen base medium and incubated for 24 h at 37°
C to form mature biofilms (mature
phase) (19).
The quantification of the biofilms formed by different strains was performed using a colorimetric
metabolic assay (to measure mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity) and dry weight analysis (to measure
total biofilm mass, which includes fungal cells and matrix). For evaluation of metabolic activity, discs with
biofilms were transferred to 12-well tissue culture plates containing 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-
sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT; 12.5 �g/ml) and menadione (1 �M) in phosphate-

 buffered saline and incubated at 37°
C for 3 h as described previously (19). Next, the biofilms were
scraped, transferred into a tube, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 min. The absorbance of the resulting
supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically at 492 nm. To determine dry weight (biomass), the
pellet obtained from the centrifugation step described above was resuspended in phosphate-buffered
saline and filtered through a preweighed filter (pore size, 0.2 �m; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), dried at
37°
C for 48 h, and weighed (19). The biomass of the biofilms was calculated from the difference in the
weight of the preweighed filters.
To examine the morphology and thickness of the formed biofilms, confocal scanning laser micros-
copy was used. Briefly, following biofilm formation, the silicon elastomer discs on which the biofilms were
developed were transferred to a 35-mm-diameter glass-bottom petri dish (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA,
USA) and incubated for 45 min at 37°
C in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing the fluorescent
stains FUN-1 (10 �M) and concanavalin A (ConA; 25 mg/liter)-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (both dyes from
Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). FUN-1 (excitation wavelength, 543 nm; emission wavelength, 560
nm) is converted to orange-red cylindrical intravacuolar structures by metabolically active cells, and
ConA (excitation wavelength, 488 nm; emission wavelength, 505 nm) fluoresces green when bound to
glucose and mannose residues of fungal polysaccharides (present in the cell wall and biofilm matrix).
After incubation with the dyes, the silicon elastomer discs were flipped and the biofilms were examined
using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal scanning laser microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). To determine the structure of
the biofilms, a series of horizontal (x-y) optical sections with a thickness of 0.9 �m were taken at 0.44-�m
intervals throughout the full length of the biofilm. Confocal images of green (ConA) and red (FUN-1)
fluorescence were simultaneously collected using a multitrack mode (19).
Determination of susceptibility profiles of C. auris strains. To establish the susceptibility profiles
of the C. auris strains, broth microdilution susceptibility testing was performed in accordance with the
guidelines in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 document (52). RPMI 1640
medium with 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (RPMI), an inoculum of 0.5 � 103 to 2.5 � 103
cells/ml, and incubation at 35°
C were used. The activities of 11 antifungals against the C. auris isolates
were tested, including SCY-078 (Scynexis, Jersey City, NJ, USA), a novel orally bioavailable 1,3-�-D-glucan
synthesis inhibitor, and currently available antifungals amphotericin B and anidulafungin (Pfizer Phar-
maceuticals, New York, NY, USA), caspofungin (Merck Co., Kenilworth, NJ, USA), fluconazole, flucytosine,
and isavuconazole (Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Northbrook, IL, USA), itraconazole and micafungin (Astellas
Pharma, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), posaconazole, and voriconazole (AMB, FLC, 5FC, ITC, POS, and VRC were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). MIC panels were incubated for 24 h (SCY-078, AMB,
AFG, CAS, FLC, ISA, MFG, and VRC) or 48 h (5FC, AMB, FLC, ITC, POS, and VRC). MIC endpoints were
determined visually as the lowest concentration of drug that resulted in the complete inhibition of
growth (AMB) or a decrease of growth by �50% relative to that of the growth control (SCY-078, AFG,
CAS, FLC, 5FC, ISA, ITC, MFG, POS, VRC) (52). In all instances, MIC plates were prepared using reagent-
grade powders, as directed by CLSI (52).
Effect of SCY-078 on the growth of C. auris and C. albicans. Evaluation of the ability of a drug to
inhibit microbial growth is conventionally determined either by counting the number of CFU, which is
an indicator of cell viability, or by turbidity measurement (using a spectrophotometer), which indicates
cell density but does not differentiate between live and dead cells (52, 53). In this study, we used the
spectrophotometric approach to evaluate the ability of SCY-078 to inhibit Candida growth as
described previously (54). Briefly, cells were harvested from 18- to 24-h-old cultures, washed twice
with phosphate-buffered saline, and adjusted to 5 � 105 cells/ml in 50-ml conical tubes containing
RPMI alone (with no drug as a growth control) or 0.5�, 1�, 2�, 4�, 8�, or 16� MIC of SCY-078.
Medium alone with no drug or yeast cells was used as a blank. All tubes were incubated at 37°
C. At
different time points (0, 5, 8, 24, 30, 48, and 54 h), aliquots were taken and their optical densities
(ODs) were determined spectrophotometrically at 520 nm. A growth curve showing cell inhibition
temporally was constructed.
Scanning electron microscopy. The effect of SCY-078 on C. auris morphology and ultrastructure was
determined using scanning electron microscopy as described previously (19). Briefly, the C. auris strains
were exposed overnight to 1� MIC (0.5 mg/liter) of SCY-078 at 35°
C. Next, 200 �l of a cell suspension
was fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, and the fixed cell suspension was incubated at 4°
C for 48 h. After fixation,
the samples were processed and dried. The processed samples were coated with palladium for 60 s and
viewed with a Nova NanoLab 200 FEG-SEM/FIB scanning electron microscope in high-vacuum mode at
2.00 kV.
Effect of SCY-078 on C. auris biofilms. To evaluate the activity of SCY-078 against C. auris biofilms,
discs with mature biofilms were transferred to wells containing different concentrations of SCY-078
(range, 0.5 to 4 mg/liter). Following 48 h of incubation, the metabolic activities of the biofilms were
measured using the XTT reduction assay as described above. Images and the thicknesses of biofilms
growing in the presence or absence of drug were captured using confocal scanning laser microscopy,
also as described above (19).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses of all the data were performed using GraphPad Prism
(version 6) software. The treated groups were compared to the untreated control groups using unpaired
t tests, and a P value of �0.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were done in
triplicate. Doubling times were calculated using R, the statistical programming language (https://cran.r-
project.org/).
Accession number(s). The sequences of C. auris strains MRL 31102 and MRL 31103 have been
deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KY514262 and KY514058, respectively.
