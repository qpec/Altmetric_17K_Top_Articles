Misclassification of cardiometabolic health when using
body mass index categories in NHANES 2005–2012

The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has proposed rules allowing employers to penalize employees up to
30% of health insurance costs if they fail to meet ‘health’ criteria, such as reaching a specified body mass index (BMI). Our objective
was to examine cardiometabolic health misclassifications given standard BMI categories. Participants (N = 40 420) were individuals
aged 18+ in the nationally representative 2005–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Using the blood pressure,
triglyceride, cholesterol, glucose, insulin resistance and C-reactive protein data, population frequencies/percentages
of metabolically healthy versus unhealthy individuals were stratified by BMI. Nearly half of overweight individuals, 29% of
obese individuals and even 16% of obesity type 2/3 individuals were metabolically healthy. Moreover, over 30% of normal weight
individuals were cardiometabolically unhealthy. There was no significant race-by-BMI interaction, but there was a significant
gender-by-BMI interaction, F(4,64) = 3.812, P = 0.008. Using BMI categories as the main indicator of health, an estimated 74 936 678
US adults are misclassified as cardiometabolically unhealthy or cardiometabolically healthy. Policymakers should consider the
unintended consequences of relying solely on BMI, and researchers should seek to improve diagnostic tools related to weight
and cardiometabolic health.

INTRODUCTION
The recently proposed rules by the Equal Employment Opportu-
nity Commission (EEOC) allow employers to penalize an employee
up to 30% of the cost of their health insurance if they fail to meet
specific ‘health’ criteria, such as reaching a specified (lower) body
mass index (BMI). Such a policy is based on the fact that
overweight and obesity are associated with poor health condi-
tions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and
some cancers.1,2 This kind of policy carries with it the major
assumption that higher BMI individuals must uniformly face poor
health. Yet, the relationship between BMI and health is complex,
and focusing on between-BMI category variation in morbidity and
mortality
obscures
substantial
within-category
variability
in
cardiometabolic health.3 Here, we test this assumption using the
most recent nationally representative data available. We docu-
ment the prevalence and demographic distribution of cardiome-
tabolic
health,
highlighting
the
considerable
number
of
individuals whose
health
status
is misclassified
when
BMI
categories are used as a proxy for actual health.
Misclassifying individual health on the basis of high BMI has
numerous potential consequences. Not only do these types of
punitive policies exacerbate the well-established economic con-
sequences of being heavy,4 but they are also perceived as
stigmatizing by heavier individuals,5 which can have a host of
negative mental and physical health consequences.6 Furthermore,
individuals with an overweight or obese BMI are often instructed
by their physicians to lose weight. If these individuals are
otherwise healthy, however, intentional weight loss may actually
increase risk for mortality.7 The assumption underlying a policy
like the EEOC’s also has potential consequences for lower BMI
individuals. If these individuals are classified as healthy solely
based on their BMI, they may not engage in proper preventive
care or diagnoses may be delayed.
Given these potential consequences of misclassification, the
goal of this study is to quantify the extent to which individual
cardiometabolic health is mischaracterized when using estab-
lished BMI categories. To do so, we draw on the most recently
available nationally representative prevalence data on cardiome-
tabolic health drawn from the 2005–2012 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We use the stringent
definition of metabolic health described in Wildman et al.,3 which
relies on the greatest number of criteria across multiple systems
(blood
pressure,
triglycerides,
cholesterol,
glucose,
insulin
resistance and C-reactive protein), and was used with earlier data
from NHANES.
METHODS
NHANES provides data on the health and nutritional status of
adults in the US through interviews and physical examinations.
Sampling for NHANES is representative of the noninstitutionalized
civilian US population and consists of ~ 5000 persons each year.
The present analyses are based on NHANES participants 18 and
older from 2005–2012, who completed the interview, examination
and/or lab components of NHANES. N for analyses ranged
from
12 351
(homeostasis
model
assessment)
to
39 303
(demographics).

 Age, gender, race/ethnicity and pregnancy were self-reported.8
For the present analyses, race was categorized as follows: Mexican
American, Non-Hispanic white, Non-Hispanic black and other. Use
of antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and antidiabetic medications
was also self-reported.8
Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm by a stadiometer,
and weight was measured in kilograms by a digital weight scale
with participants wearing a standard examination gown.8 BMI
values were calculated from measured height and weight values
using the standard equation: weight(kg)/height(m)2. Waist cir-
cumference was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the end of
participants’ normal expiration.8
Because a standardized definition of metabolic health has yet to
be established, the present analyses used the definition outlined
by Wildman et al.,3 which uses the greatest number of criteria
among existing definition options. This defines metabolic health
as 0–1 of the following metabolic abnormalities: (1) systolic/
diastolic blood pressure ⩾ 130/85 mm Hg or antihypertensive
medication use; (2) fasting triglyceride level ⩾ 150 mg dl − 1
(1.69 mmol l − 1);
(3)
high
density
lipoprotein-cholesterol
level o40 mg dl − 1 (1.04 mmol l − 1) in men or o50 mg dl − 1
(1.29 mmol l − 1) in women or lipid-lowering medication use; (4)
fasting glucose level ⩾ 100 mg dl − 1 (5.55 mmol l − 1) or antidia-
betic medication use; (5) homeostasis model assessment-IR 45.13
and (6) high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level 40.1 mg l − 1 (0.95
nmol l − 1).
Three consecutive blood pressure readings were averaged.8
Due to high prevalence of extremely low implausible diastolic
blood
pressure
measurements,
all
diastolic
blood
pressure
o35 mm Hg, were excluded in the present analyses. Triglycerides
were determined by timed-endpoint.8 Glucose was determined by
oxygen rate. High density lipoprotein-cholesterol was measured
enzymatically through traditional precipitation methods.8 Insulin
was measured using two-site enzyme immunoassay. CRP was
quantified by latex-enhanced nephelometry.8
Statistical analyses
Data from the 2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2009–2010 and 2011–2012
data collection cycles were appended and the sampling weights
modified as directed in NHANES documentation. All analyses were
done on the non-pregnant subpopulation of the data. Female
respondents who had a positive lab pregnancy test or self-
reported as pregnant were excluded. Listwise deletion of missing
data was done for all analyses.
Means/percentages were calculated for the overall population as
well as five BMI categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight,
obesity and obesity types 2/3 (combined due to low n). Logistic
regressions controlling for age (top-coded at 80 years) were
conducted using healthy versus not healthy as the outcome
variable. Gender and BMI category were used as predictors.
Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA) and SUDAAN 11.0.1 (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC, USA). The sampling weight was adjusted for the
multiple years following the method suggested in NHANES
documentation.9 This revised sampling weight, clustering and
stratification were incorporated into all analyses as recommended
in NHANES documentation.10
RESULTS
Table 1 displays descriptive statistics. Table 2 presents population
frequencies and percentages of healthy versus unhealthy meta-
bolic status, stratified by BMI category. Although the relative
percentage of healthy versus unhealthy individuals decreased in
obesity, as expected, fully 19 761 047 obese US adults were
classified as metabolically healthy. Supplementary Figure 1 dis-
plays the age-adjusted predicted population frequencies and
percentages of healthy versus unhealthy stratified by BMI, further
stratified by gender and race, respectively.
No significant race-by-BMI interaction emerged, F(12,64) = 1.62,
P = 0.11). There was a significant gender-by-BMI interaction,
F(4,64) = 3.81, P = 0.008, further qualified by examining specific
meaningful combinations of gender and BMI. Pairwise compar-
isons within BMI-by-gender groups using Sidak correction for
multiple comparisons indicated normal weight females had
greater odds of being metabolically healthy than normal weight
men (OR = 1.41, Po0.001), as did women with type 2/3 obesity
compared with men with type 2/3 obesity (OR = 2.05, P = 0.034).
However, obese women were no more likely to be metabolically
healthy than obese men (OR = 1.13, P = 0.909).
DISCUSSION
Overweight and obesity have long been considered uniformly
detrimental to health, and recently proposed rules by the EEOC
would codify this into policy. Yet focusing on BMI ignores
overweight and obese individuals who are cardiometabolically
healthy—nearly half of overweight individuals, ~ 29% of obese
individuals, and ~ 16% of obesity type 2 and 3 individuals. For
these individuals, having a healthcare provider prescribe weight
loss could be a misuse of time, patient effort and resources.
Focusing on BMI as a proxy for health may also contribute to and
exacerbate weight stigmatization, an issue that is particularly
concerning given healthcare providers evince high levels of anti-
fat bias.11,12 Moreover, this focus ignores the many individuals
whose BMI is considered ‘normal’ yet are cardiometabolically
unhealthy—30% of this population. When healthcare providers
deem these individuals as ‘healthy’ merely because they are not
overweight or obese, critical diagnoses could be delayed or
missed altogether. Overall, we found that using BMI as the main
indicator of cardiometabolic health misclassifies an estimated
74 936 678 individuals.
These results clearly indicate that health policies such as those
proposed by the EEOC should not rely on BMI. Not only are such
policies discriminatory, but they run the risk of overlooking more
effective approaches. A recent component analysis suggests that
the most effective health interventions are those that emphasize
health behaviors, foster improved self-concept (for example, a
sense of self-efficacy) and provide practical skills (for example,
stress management); targeting weight and weight loss was found
to be unnecessary to improve health.13 We recognize, however,
that BMI may be seen as a quick, convenient and inexpensive
marker of health in the clinical setting. Yet excessive focus on
weight is likely to have detrimental consequences for the health
and wellbeing of heavier individuals14 and thus should not be the
principal outcome in health promotion efforts.15
Although obtaining blood markers is more time intensive,
invasive, and costly, doing so can foster more accurate diagnosis
and
improved
patient
care.
If
lab
markers
are
absolutely
unobtainable, potential solutions are to instead use markers that
researchers argue are a more accurate marker of health than BMI,
such as physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness,16–18 waist
circumference19 or body fat percentage,16 or their combination.
Regardless of the ultimate solution, the need for improved
diagnostic tools related to cardiometabolic health is clear.
We contend that blood pressure, triglyceride, cholesterol,
glucose, insulin resistance and C-reactive protein data are more
accurate measures of health than BMI. However, this multi-system
definition of cardiometabolic health should be confirmed using
mortality data from longitudinal studies.20
In sum, a large proportion of US adults are misclassified as
cardiometabolically
unhealthy
according
to
BMI
categories,
indicating that the EEOC and other entities should not rely on
BMI when formulating health policy. Moreover, a clinical focus
guided by weight and BMI may be misdirected. Future research
