Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that recognize and
lyse virally infected or transformed cells. This latter property is
being pursued in clinics to treat leukemia with the hope that further
breakthroughs in NK cell biology can extend treatments to other
cancers. At issue is the ability to expand transferred NK cells and
prolong their functionality within the context of a tumor. In terms of
NK cell expansion and survival, we now report that Kruppel-like factor
2 (KLF2) is a key transcription factor that underpins both of these
events. Excision of Klf2 using gene-targeted mouse models promotes
spontaneous proliferation of immature NK cells in peripheral tissues, a
phenotype that is replicated under ex vivo conditions. Moreover, KLF2
imprints a homeostatic migration pattern on mature NK cells that
allows these cells to access IL-15–rich microenvironments. KLF2 accom-
plishes this feat within the mature NK cell lineage via regulation of a
subset of homing receptors that respond to homeostatic ligands while
leaving constitutively expressed receptors that recognize inflamma-
tory cytokines unperturbed. Under steady-state conditions, KLF2-
deficient NK cells alter their expression of homeostatic homing recep-
tors and subsequently undergo apoptosis due to IL-15 starvation. This
novel mechanism has implications regarding NK cell contraction fol-
lowing the termination of immune responses including the possibility
that retention of an IL-15 transpresenting support system is key to
extending NK cell activity in a tumor environment.

N
atural killer (NK) cells are a subset of group 1 innate lym-
phoid cells (ILCs) that participate in viral and tumor
clearance by directly lysing stressed cells and producing cytokines
that recruit and activate effector leukocytes (1). Humans and
mice that lack NK cells have increased incidence of cancer (2),
and clinical trials have demonstrated that adoptively transferred
allogeneic NK cells can improve patient outcome without con-
tributing to graft-versus-host disease (3). Moreover, in vivo ex-
pansion and persistence of donor NK cells correlates with tumor
clearance (4), which suggests that therapeutic efficacy can be
enhanced by augmenting NK cell survival. Therefore, un-
derstanding basic mechanisms that support NK cell homeostasis
has clinical implications in terms of cancer therapy.
Following the establishment of a diverse NK cell receptor rep-
ertoire, NK cells exit the bone marrow and circulate throughout
peripheral tissues including the lungs, liver, gut, lymph nodes, blood,
and splenic red pulp (5, 6). In mice, peripheral NK cell differenti-
ation is further described in relation to CD11b and CD27 surface
expression, progressing in maturity from CD27+CD11b− (stage 1)
to CD27+CD11b+ (stage 2) to CD27−CD11b+ (stage 3) (7). With
regard to peripheral homeostasis, early CD27+ NK cell stages are
associated with IL-15–dependent proliferation (8, 9), whereas later
CD11b+ stages require IL-15 for survival (10). As such, these two
IL-15–dependent events are prime targets for controlling NK cell
expansion and in vivo persistence.
To better understand how NK cell homeostasis is regulated, we
investigated the potential role of transcription factor Kruppel-
like factor 2 (KLF2) within the NK cell compartment by using
Klf2 gene-targeted mice. The rational for this study was
threefold: (i) KLF2 maintains homeostasis in other lymphocyte
compartments, including quiescent B (11–13) and T cells (14, 15);
(ii) NK cell proliferation is regulated by a P13K-PDK1-Akt-mTOR
signaling pathway (9, 16–18), which terminates KLF2 expression in
other lymphocyte populations (19, 20; and (iii) Foxo1, which regu-
lates Klf2 transcription in T cells (21, 22), inhibits late stage NK cell
differentiation (23). Based on these reports, we predicted that Klf2
gene-targeted mice would exhibit mature NK cell hyperplasia be-
cause of dysregulated proliferation and relaxed maturation check-
points. Indeed, Klf2 excision promoted CD27+ NK cell cycling in a
cell-intrinsic manner. However, instead of a preponderance of late-
stage NK cells, we found that KLF2 was necessary for CD11b+ ef-
fector cell survival. Under steady-state conditions, KLF2-deficient
NK cells altered expression of homeostatic homing receptors,
thereby preventing these cells from accessing IL-15–rich microenvi-
ronments. Importantly, aberrant migration proceeded KLF2-
deficient NK cell death, which was confined to an in vivo setting.
Therefore, we conclude that KLF2 regulates mature NK cell ho-
meostasis by limiting production of newly differentiated effector cells
while simultaneously supporting their survival by guiding these cells
toward transpresented IL-15. This latter event may represent a novel
form of tolerance that terminates unwarranted NK cell activity.
Results
KLF2 Is Necessary for Conventional NK Cell Homeostasis. KLF2 is
necessary to maintain B and T-cell homeostasis (11–15). To
determine whether this transcription factor played a similar role in
NK cells, we first verified that KLF2 was expressed under steady-
state conditions. Following lineage commitment and initial develop-
ment in the bone marrow, NK cells home to peripheral tissues, where
they continue a differentiation program that is characterized by the
surface expression of CD27 and CD11b (7). Isolating individual
populations (CD27+CD11b−, CD27+CD11b+, and CD27−CD11b+),
Significance
Adoptive transfer of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells into
leukemia patients can lead to remission; however, therapies
are hindered by inefficient expansion and limited persistence
of these lymphocytes. We now report that Kruppel-like factor 2
(KLF2) regulates both NK cell proliferation and survival. KLF2
limits homeostatic expansion of NK cells in a cell-intrinsic
manner. In addition, KLF2 instructs mature NK cells to home to
IL-15–rich niches, which is necessary for continued survival
under homeostatic conditions. Therefore, targeting KLF2 while
providing rate-limiting survival factors such as transpresented
IL-15 may improve NK cell engraftment and sustainability in
cancer patients.

 mRNA and protein analysis revealed that KLF2 is expressed early
during NK cell development and increases with maturation (Fig. 1A).
Next, we assessed NK cell homeostasis in Klf2 gene-targeted mice.
To ensure KLF2 was depleted from the entire NK cell compartment
(Fig. 1B), Vav-cre transgenic animals were used to excise floxed al-
leles of Klf2 (Klf2fl/fl) in hematopoietic stem cells. Early NK cell de-
velopment and MHC licensing was intact in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl animals,
as reflected by normal frequencies of bone marrow-derived NK cells
expressing activating (NK1.1, NKG2D, NKp46, Ly49H) and in-
hibitory (Ly49C/I, Ly49D, Ly49G2) receptors (Fig. S1A). In contrast,
loss of KLF2 resulted in increased CD27+CD11b− NK cell fre-
quencies in all tissues, with the exception of mesenteric lymph nodes
(Fig. 1C). Absolute CD27+CD11b− NK cell numbers were also in-
creased in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, the latter two tissues
being sites that preferentially harbor immature NK cell populations.
These cells expressed high levels of transcription factor EOMES and
were either CD127− (spleen) or CD49b+TRAIL− (liver), indicating
that they were NK cells and not misidentified NK1.1+ ILC1 cells
(24) (Fig. S1B). Instead, ILC1 numbers remained constant in Vav-
cre; Klf2fl/fl animals. Likewise, loss of KLF2 did not affect
CD49a+CD49b− tissue-resident NK cells in the liver (25) (Fig. S1C).
Collectively, these data suggest that KLF2 limits proliferation as-
sociated with CD27+CD11b− NK cell differentiation but does not
affect homeostasis of neighboring lineages, including ILC1 cells.
Despite the increase in early stage NK cells, Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl
mice had significantly fewer CD27+CD11b+ and CD27−CD11b+
NK cells relative to littermate controls (Fig. 1C). Costaining for
CD43+ and CD11b+ (markers for late-stage NK cells) confirmed
that KLF2 gene-targeted mice lacked mature CD43+CD11b+
populations in all examined tissues (Fig. 1D). Given that IL-15 is
essential for NK cell survival (26–28), we hypothesized that KLF2-
deficient NK cells were unable to respond to this cytokine. How-
ever, KLF2-deficient NK cells expressed normal surface levels of
CD122 (IL-2Rβ) and CD132 (γc) (Fig. 1E) that conveyed IL-15–
mediated signaling events when stimulated ex vivo (Fig. 1F), which
suggested that defective IL-15R signaling was not responsible for
mature NK cell depletion. [Increased baseline expression of
phospho-S6 in immature NK cells reflects elevated metabolism, as
noted (17).] Instead, it was possible that mature NK cells were
present in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice but that they were either mis-
identified (i.e., KLF2 regulates CD11b and CD43 expression) or
located in alternate tissues. To address the former option, we used
cytolytic activity as a surrogate marker to identify mature KLF2-
deficient NK cells. Reflective of their immature status, total NK
cells harvested from Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice expressed low levels of
granzyme B (Fig. 2A) and had a reduced ability to lyse YAC-1
target cells ex vivo (Fig. 2B). At the same time, KLF2-deficient
NK cells responded to anti-NK1.1 stimulation by increasing sur-
face expression of the degranulation marker CD107a (Fig. 2C),
which indicated that cell-intrinsic effector functions were not di-
rectly regulated by KLF2. Together, these data suggest that ma-
ture NK cells are not present in the spleens of Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl
mice. To extend this finding to additional tissues, in vivo tumor
clearance was analyzed in animal cohorts following coinjection of
NK cell-sensitive (RMA-S) and NK cell-resistant (RMA) tumor
cells. Compared with littermate controls, Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl animals
were unable to effectively clear RMA-S target cells (Fig. 2D).
Therefore, we conclude that effector NK cells are absent in Vav-cre;
Klf2fl/fl mice and that KLF2 is necessary to support mature NK
cell homeostasis.
KLF2-Regulated NK Cell Homeostasis Is Cell Intrinsic. Mature NK cell
survival depends on IL-15 that is typically transpresented as an IL-
15/IL-15Rα complex on the surface of mesenchymal and myeloid
cells (28–31). Because Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice excised Klf2 within the
myeloid compartment, NK cell homeostasis may have been al-
tered because of compromised IL-15 presentation. To test this
hypothesis, NK cell populations were analyzed in LysM-cre; Klf2fl/fl
mice that excised Klf2 in a myeloid-specific manner (Fig. S2A).
Using this genetic model, we found normal numbers of CD27+
CD11b− and CD11b+CD27+ cells, and a slight but statistical de-
crease in CD27−CD11b+ NK cells. These results suggest that
major NK cell phenotypes observed in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice were
independent of myeloid cells. Additionally, a prior study demon-
strated that transferring mutant NK cells into wild-type animals
could overcome myeloid-specific defects in NK cell development
(32); however, KLF2-deficient NK cell survival was not rescued
under these circumstances (Fig. S2B). To confirm that KLF2 in-
trinsically regulates NK cell homeostasis, lethally irradiated wild-
type CD45.2+ mice were reconstituted with a 1:1 ratio of wild type
(CD45.1+) versus Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl (CD45.2+) bone marrow and
analyzed 8 wk later. As shown in Fig. 3, CD27+CD11b+ and
CD27−CD11b+ NK cells were primarily derived from wild-type
recipients, whereas the majority of CD27+CD11b− NK cells were
KLF2-deficient. Collectively, these data indicate that KLF2 maintains
late-stage NK cell homeostasis in a cell-intrinsic manner and may a
play a role in suppressing early stage NK cell proliferation.

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 KLF2 Suppresses Homeostatic Proliferation of NK Cells. KLF2 was
originally reported to prevent the spontaneous proliferation of
quiescent T cells (33, 34); however, subsequent work demonstrated
that this event was not a cell-intrinsic effect (14, 15). To better
characterize KLF2’s role in early stage NK cell cycling, 5-bromo-2′-
deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation was quantified as a measure of
steady-state NK cell proliferation (Fig. 4A). Compared with control
littermates, significantly more BrdU+ NK cells were present in the
bone marrow of Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl animals, the majority of which were
CD27+CD11b−. Nuclear staining for Ki-67, which identifies pro-
liferating cells, confirmed that immature NK cells were undergoing
increased cell cycling in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice (Fig. 4B). To de-
termine whether KLF2-deficient NK cells had increased access to
proliferation-inducing factors in vivo, NK cell cycling was examined
under controlled ex vivo conditions. Using a tamoxifen-inducible
Cre system, NK cells harvested from T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl versus littermate
control mice were cocultured (1:1 ratio) in media supplemented
with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) and IL-2, the latter cytokine
added to support cell cycling. After 5 d in culture, increased num-
bers of CD45.2+ cells from T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice were recovered
relative to CD45.1+ control cells (Fig. 4C), primarily due to an
expansion of CD27+CD11b− NK cells. Flow cytometric analysis also
demonstrated that more KLF2-deficient NK cells exhibited a blast
morphology compared with KLF2-sufficent cells, consistent with
KLF2 limiting early stage NK cell proliferation.
Mature NK Cells Require KLF2 To Access Transpresented IL-15. Lym-
phocyte proliferation and differentiation are typically exclusionary
events, which raised the possibility that KLF2 was necessary for
mature NK cell differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we per-
formed ex vivo differentiation assays by using NK cells harvested
from control versus Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice. To aid in our analysis,
input populations were depleted of CD11b+ cells to offset the in-
creased frequency of mature NK cells present in wild-type animals.
Following 72 h and 96 h in stromal culture supplemented with IL-
15, IL-12, and IL-18, KLF2-deficient NK cells differentiated into
CD27+CD11b+ (R2) and CD27−CD11b+ (R3) cells that expressed
the maturity markers, KLRG1 and granzyme B (Fig. 5). From this
result, we conclude that KLF2 is not necessary for late-stage NK
cell differentiation.
Given that KLF2-deficient NK cells can fully differentiate ex
vivo but not in vivo, we hypothesized that NK cells were unable
to access a limited survival niche in Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice.
Transpresented IL-15 is necessary for late-stage NK cell survival,
which is rate limiting under steady-state conditions (35). For this
reason, we performed immunohistochemistry to document NK
cell localization relative to IL-15 in the spleens of Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl
versus littermate controls. Using a metallophilic macrophage anti-
body (MOMA-1) to delineate the marginal sinus that forms a ring
around the white pulp, we found that NK cells predominately
localized in the red pulp of Klf2fl/fl control mice (Fig. 6A). In con-
trast, significantly more KLF2-deficient NK cells were present in the
T-cell–rich area of the white pulp. These KLF2-deficient NKp46+
cells stained negatively for TCRβ, thus confirming that they were
NK cells and not NKT cells. Within the spleen, IL-15 is typically
presented by myeloid cells and VCAM-1+ stromal cells (36) located
in the red pulp. Consistent with a lack of mature NK cells in Vav-
cre; Klf2fl/fl mice, KLF2-deficient NK cells were preferentially lo-
cated in IL-15–depleted areas of the white and red pulp (Fig. 6B
and Fig. S3). To verify that differences in localization were directly
attributable to KLF2-regulated NK cell migration and not
maturation-associated homing patterns (5), we examined how
similarly differentiated KLF2-replete and KLF2-deficient NK
cells trafficked in vivo. In this instance, KLF2-deficient NK
cells were harvested from tamoxifen-treated T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl
mice before alterations in subset frequencies (Fig. 6C, i). Fol-
lowing cotransfer into wild-type animals, we found that KLF2+

 NK cells primarily homed to the red pulp and associated with
F4/80+ myeloid cells (Fig. 6C, ii), a cell type that transpresents
IL-15 (10). In contrast, a significant number of KLF2-deficient
NK cells migrated to the white pulp, as defined by MOMA-1
staining (Fig. 6C, iii), and were distal to myeloid cells. There-
fore, we conclude that KLF2 directs NK cell trafficking under
noninflammatory conditions, the implication being that this
migration pattern supports late-stage NK cell survival.
KLF2 Regulates Mature NK Cell Homing Receptor Expression and
Survival. Mature NK cells circulate throughout the vasculature
and quickly respond to inflammatory chemokine gradients
without prior activation. As such, NK cells need to constitutively
express a hybrid array of homing receptors that recognize ligands
present under steady-state (e.g., CD62L, CX3CR1, S1P5) and
inflammatory conditions (e.g., CCR2, CCR5, CXCR3). To de-
termine whether any of these receptors were modified in re-
sponse to Klf2 excision, mature NK cell populations harvested
from tamoxifen-treated T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice were examined by
flow cytometry (Fig. 7A) or by RT-PCR when antibodies were
not available (Fig. 7B). Compared with mature NK cells from
tamoxifen-treated
littermate
controls,
KLF2-deficient
cells
expressed significantly less CD62L, Cx3cr1, and Edg8. Surpris-
ingly, CCR7 was up-regulated following Klf2 excision, which
suggested that a chemokine receptor typically associated with
naïve T-cell trafficking was actively repressed by KLF2 in mature
NK cells. Previous studies have noted that NK cells increase
CCR7 expression and decrease CD62L surface levels following
NK cell activation (37) or PI3K activity (16), respectively, and
because KLF2 is degraded in a PI3K-associated manner fol-
lowing T-cell activation (19, 20), we were curious whether a
similar process existed within the NK cell compartment. Indeed,
stimulation
of
NK
cells
via
activating
receptors
(NK1.1,
NKG2D) promoted KLF2 proteolysis (Fig. S4A). Moreover, NK
cells cultured in the presence of a PI3K-inhibitor impaired KLF2
degradation (Fig. S4B), the implication being that this signaling
pathway regulates KLF2 levels. To assess how closely Klf2 exci-
sion replicated homing receptor regulation following NK cell
activation, wild-type NK cells were stimulated with the toll-like
receptor 3 agonist, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)],
then examined for differential receptor expression. Similar to
KLF2-deficient cells, poly(I:C)-treated NK cells altered their
surface levels of CCR7 and CD62L (Fig. S4C) and (PMA/ion-
omycin)-activated CD27−CD11b+ NK cells expressed less Edg8
mRNA (Fig. S4D). Of note, elevated CCR7 expression is con-
sistent with observed NK cell entry into splenic white pulp fol-
lowing poly(I:C) challenge (38). Poly(I:C)-activated NK cells also
altered their surface expression of CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR3—
homing receptors that respond to inflammatory cytokines (Fig.
S4E). In contrast, Klf2 excision did not appreciably affect the
expression of these inflammatory homing receptors (Fig. 7C).
From these studies, we conclude that KLF2 regulates expression
of homing receptors that respond to homeostatic ligands; how-
ever, this transcription factor does not impact inflammatory
chemokine receptors within the NK cell compartment.
With regard to how this alteration in homing receptors im-
pacted the NK cell compartment, we found that mature NK cell
numbers decreased over time when Klf2 was excised under
noninflammatory conditions (Fig. 7D). Unlike poly(I:C) treat-
ment that causes splenic NK cell displacement into the liver (ref.
39; Fig. S4F), Klf2 excision did not cause an accumulation of
mature NK cells in any observed tissues. Instead, analysis of NK
cells harvested from tamoxifen-treated Klf2fl/fl versus T2-cre;
Klf2fl/fl littermates revealed that this reduction was due to in-
creased apoptosis of mature NK cells (Fig. 7E). Importantly,
KLF2-deficient NK cell apoptosis (d7 onwards) occurred after
alterations in homing receptors (d5; Fig. 7 A–C) and aberrant
migration (d5; Fig. 6C). From these results, we conclude that
KLF2 controls NK cell migration via regulation of homeostatic
homing receptors, the alteration of which does not support NK
cell survival under steady-state conditions.
Discussion
Adoptive transfer of allogeneic NK cells is a promising cancer
therapy (40, 41); however, to maximize its potential in the clinic,
it is important to devise new ways of increasing NK cell numbers
and prolonging effector functions in vivo. Results from this study
indicate that low levels of KLF2 limit antigen-independent NK cell
proliferation in all tissues and removal of this factor expands the
proliferative burst associated with CD27+CD11b− NK cells. These

KLF2 suppresses proliferation in immature NK cells. (A) BrdU in-
corporation over 5 d was used to assess NK cell (CD122+Lin−) proliferation in
various tissues harvested from Klf2fl/fl versus Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl littermates. n =
6 mice per cohort, pooled from two independent experiments. (B) The per-
centage of CD122+Lin− NK cells actively proliferating was quantified by Ki-67
expression. n = 7 mice per group (two pooled experiments). (C) Equal numbers
of MACS-sorted NK cells from wild type (CD45.1+) versus T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl (CD45.2+)
mice were cocultured in 4-OHT and IL-2 to induce Klf2 excision and support
proliferation, respectively. NK cells were analyzed by flow cytometry before (i)
and after (iii) excision and Klf2 expression was assessed by RT-PCR at day 5 (ii).
This experiment was repeated twice by using three biological replicates per
group. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; N.S., not significant.

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 findings are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that the
PI3K-PDK1-mTOR signaling pathway promotes NK cell cycling (9,
17, 18, 42, 43), because we and others have shown that signaling
receptors that activate the PI3K pathway suppress KLF2 expression
in T cells (19, 20) and B cells (12). Surprisingly, Foxo1, which is
negatively regulated by PI3K signaling and directly promotes Klf2
transcription in T cells (21, 22), does not appear to link PI3K-
mediated activating events with KLF2 expression in NK cells. This
disconnect between transcription factors is evidenced by an inverse
expression pattern (in contrast to KLF2, Foxo1 expression
decreases from stage 1→stage 3) and increased frequencies of
CD27−CD11b+ NK cells in Foxo1 gene-targeted animals (23).
This heretofore association between these two molecules raises
the question as to what factors directly promote Klf2 transcrip-
tion in NK cells. Addressing this issue may provide a therapeutic
means of increasing NK cell numbers by suppressing KLF2 ex-
pression in a lineage-specific manner.
In addition to controlling NK cell cycling, KLF2 is necessary for
late-stage NK cell survival under steady-state conditions. More
specifically, KLF2 regulates homeostatic homing receptors so that
these cells gain access to transpresented IL-15. In contrast, activated
NK cells degrade KLF2 and alter their homing receptor expression
patterns accordingly. Both quiescent and activated NK cells rely on
IL-15 for survival (44–46), which implies that activated NK cells
have access to IL-15 that is not available to KLF2-deficient NK cells
under noninflammatory conditions. We propose that during an in-
nate immune response that activates NK cells, myeloid cells that are
capable of IL-15 transpresentation are likewise activated and re-
cruited to inflammatory sites, thereby maintaining NK cell effector
functions. In the absence of this IL-15–dependent support system,
NK cell effector activity is quickly terminated. Such an event might
occur at the conclusion of a productive NK cell immune response
when myeloid cells contract. Likewise, inappropriate NK cell

Rabacal et al.
 activation (e.g., an immune response directed against self via
NKG2D) is predicted to starve these cells of IL-15 and maintain
tolerance. This model may explain why mice and humans are
devoid of NK cell-initiated autoimmunity, despite the fact that
NK cells recognize self-ligands (e.g., stress molecules exhibited
by tumor cells) (47) and do not require additional cells to be-
come activated (48). Therefore, linking activated NK cell sur-
vival to colocalized IL-15 transpresentation may constitute a
fundamental mechanism to ensure self-tolerance. Conversely,
cancers may co-opt this tolerance mechanism to evade NK cell-
mediated tumor surveillance. If this model of IL-15 dependence
proves to be the case, then recruiting IL-15 transpresenting
cells to environments that elicit NK cell activation may prevent
NK cell exhaustion and restore antitumor immunity.
Materials and Methods
Mice. Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl and T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl mice were generated as described
(15, 19); LysM-cre and B6.SJL (CD45.1+) mice were purchased from Jackson
Laboratories. IL-15−/− mice were purchased from Taconic. Mice were housed
in pathogen-free conditions in accordance with the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at Vanderbilt University.
Flow Cytometry. Standard flow cytometric procedures were used to acquire
data on a 5-laser LSRII (BD Biosciences); analysis was performed by using
FlowJo (TreeStar) software.
Bone Marrow Chimeras. Irradiated (2 × 500 cGy) Klf2fl/fl (CD45.2+) mice were
reconstituted with 106 bone marrow cells (1:1 CD45.1+ versus Vav-cre; Klf2fl/fl
CD45.2+), then analyzed 8 wk later by FACS.
Immunohistochemistry. Cryosections were stained with the following anti-
bodies: polyclonal goat NKp46 (R&D Systems), biotin-TCRβ (BD Biosciences),
biotin-MOMA1 (Cedarlane), biotin-F4/80 (Tonbo), and biotin-IL-15 (R&D
Systems). The anti-NKp46 antibody was visualized with secondary biotinylated
F(ab’)2 Frag donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch). Nuclei were
counterstained by using Meyer’s hematoxylin solution (Sigma). Images were
acquired by using Nikon AZ 100 (Nikon) and NIS-Elements (Nikon) software.
Additional staining information is provided in SI Materials and Methods.
NK Cell Apoptosis. Klf2fl/fl and T2-cre; Klf2fl/fl littermates were placed on ta-
moxifen chow for 5 d, killed 4 d later, and NK cell populations were ex-
amined by flow cytometry. Annexin V surface expression (BD Biosciences)
and caspase cleavage (Vibrant FAM kit; Life Technologies) were used as
readouts for apoptosis based on manufacturers’ instructions.
Statistical Analysis. Data were analyzed by using a two-tailed Student t test
and displayed as the mean ± SD: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 unless
otherwise indicated.
