The limits of defaults: why french fries 
trump apple slices
Brian Wansink* and David R. Just
Abstract 
Background: Healthy default food choices have been suggested as a way to encourage better nutrition without 
restricting choice. Will they work with children and their favorite foods?
Methods: A group of children, 6–8 years old, were treated to lunch at fast food restaurant on 2 days 2 weeks apart. 
On both days the children were served chicken nuggets and a drink. On the first day, half were given French fries 
unless they asked for apple slices and the other half were given apples unless they asked for fries. The order switched 
on the second day.
Results: When the default changed from fries to apples, 86.7 % opted out of the default to order fries.
Conclusion: Defaults may be ineffective when children have a strong preference for the less healthy option. Allow-
ing children to take both sides may lead to healthier consumption than constructing an artificial default choice.

Background
Childhood obesity is partially driven by the unhealthy 
choices kids make in restaurants, school lunchrooms, and 
fast food venues. Behavioral scientists have widely sug-
gested the simple solution is to make the healthy choice 
the default choice [1]. For instance, fast food restaurants 
could offer all children’s meals with healthy side options 
so that if a child wants the less healthy option, they have 
to ask. The hesitancy to “opt-out” of a default has been 
shown to sizably increase the percentage of adults who 
tacitly agree to organ donation and payroll deductions 
for retirement [2, 3]. Default choices are effective with 
adults in contexts where they are indifferent or have no 
strong preference, but will it work with children and their 
favored foods?
Methods
All 15 of the 6–8 year old, multi-ethnic children (6 male) 
attending an upstate New York summer camp in July 
2011 participated in a Cornell IRB-approved study. All 
children at the camp came from a housing development 
in which tenants received significant government assis-
tance with their rent, and were thus likely from house-
holds with relatively low incomes. Physical consent forms 
were given to parents along with verbal explanations the 
week prior to the study. Children were also asked if they 
were willing to participate at that time. Children were all 
given children’s meals from a popular national fast food 
chain on two separate days 1 week apart. On both days 
the children were given chicken nuggets and a drink. In 
the first week, half were given French fries unless they 
asked for apple slices and the other half were given apple 
slices unless they asked for French fries. This order was 
switched in the second week so every child was given 
both apple slices and French fries as a default during one 
of the 2 weeks.
The choice of a side took place in the following way. In 
both conditions, subjects received a packet of the default 
side, and were told not to open (in the case of apples) or 
eat the packet, but count how many pieces were inside. 
Once they had the packet in their possession for about 
10 min, they were asked to go up to a researcher one by 
one, and tell how many apple slices were inside. Similar 
methods have been used in prior studies to establish an

endowment effect which some theorize to be the power 
of defaults in choice [4–6]. The researcher then offered 
them a choice to swap apple slices for French fries. Their 
choices were noted, and plate waste was measured.
Statistical analysis
We assume that the selection of French fries or apple 
slices is distributed Bernoulli, with a fixed probability θ 
that each child will choose the default. Thus, the sum of 
those choosing the default option is binomially distrib-
uted with parameters n = 15 and θ, where θ is the param-
eter of interest to be estimated. Comparing any two 
samples, we will be able to reject that both have the same 
probability of selecting the default at the p = 0.05 level if 
we observe a difference of 6 choosing the default option, 
and at the p = 0.10 level if we observe a difference of 5, 
which would correspond to 1/3 of the children changing 
their choice between treatments. Given the large effects 
claimed in the literature [2, 3] on defaults—on the order 
of 60 %—we find that this sample size is large enough to 
determine if the effects are of similar magnitude.
Results and discussion
When French fries were the default option, only one 
of fifteen children chose to switch from French fries to 
apple slices (6.7 %). In contrast, when apple slices were 
the default, all but two children chose to switch from 
apple slices to French fries (86.7 %). The difference in 
the percent switching from the default is fully 80.0 % 
(p < 0.001). Thus children responded very differently to 
the healthy default than to the unhealthy default.
All of the selected French fries were eaten on both days, 
and nearly all of the selected apple slices were consumed. 
In total, the percentage eating apple slices when French 
fries were the default was 6.7 %, while 13.3 % consumed 
apple slices when apple slices were the default. Statisti-
cally this difference was insignificant (p = 0.58). The 
default had no discernible impact on consumption of 
apples or French fries, though there was a significant dif-
ference in the decision to switch from the default.
In contrast to non-food-related research on defaults 
[3], these results suggest that defaults may not be effec-
tive with some of the most common choices. Admittedly, 
our pilot experiment uses a very small sample and the 
results must be treated with care. While our sample is 
large enough to detect effects of around 1/3 of the sam-
ple, a larger sample would be required to detect smaller 
impacts on choice. We used a procedure that emphasized 
the endowment effect in our default. An alternative view 
of defaults supposes their power comes from an individ-
ual’s lack of deliberate decision-making. Our procedure 
could have undermined such an effect by giving children 
significant time to consider their choice. Moreover, our 
procedure is not particularly practical and could not easily 
be implemented in a real world setting. In a quick service 
restaurant, it may not be fully obvious that other options 
are available, which could make defaults more powerful.
Conclusion
Default options in food choices may not be a realistic 
solution for encouraging better food choices [7]—par-
ticularly in a fast-food restaurant. Our design gave the 
6–8 year-old children every possibility to feel endowed 
with the apple slices, yet it still made no difference in 
what they chose and consumed.
The use of defaults may also dangerously lead to binary, 
either/or choices—a child either eats the healthy food 
or they eat the unhealthy food. One solution would be 
to provide both options. Perhaps offer them a reduced 
amount of French fries and a serving of apple slices [8]. 
While this solution is admittedly less healthy than eat-
ing only the apple slices, the latter outcome may be 
unrealistic.
