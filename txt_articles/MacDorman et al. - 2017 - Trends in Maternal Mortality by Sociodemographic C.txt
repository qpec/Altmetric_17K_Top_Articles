Abstract
Objective—To analyze recent trends in maternal mortality by socio-demographic characteristics 
and cause of death and to evaluate data quality.
Methods—This observational study compared data from 2008–2009 to 2013– 2014 for 27 states 
and the District of Columbia that had comparable reporting of maternal mortality throughout the 
period. Maternal mortality rates were computed per 100,000 live births. Statistical significance of 
trends and differentials was evaluated using a two-proportion z-test.
Results—The study population included 1,687 maternal deaths and 7,369,966 live births. The 
maternal mortality rate increased by 23% from 20.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 
2008–2009 to 25.4 in 2013–2014. However, most of the increase was among women aged ≥40, 
and for non-specific causes of death. From 2008–2009 to 2013–2014, maternal mortality rates 
increased by 90% for women ≥40, but did not increase significantly for women <40. The maternal 
mortality rate for non-specific causes of death increased by 48%; however, the rate for specific 
causes of death did not increase significantly between 2008–2009 (13.5) and 2013–2014 (15.0).
Conclusions—Despite the United Nations Millennium Development Goal and a 44% decline in 
maternal mortality worldwide from 1990–2015, maternal mortality has not improved in the United 
States, and appears to be increasing. Maternal mortality rates for women ≥40 and for non-specific 
causes of death were implausibly high and increased rapidly, suggesting possible over-reporting of 
maternal deaths which may be increasing over time. Efforts to improve reporting for the pregnancy 
checkbox, and to modify coding procedures to place less reliance on the checkbox are essential to 
improving vital statistics maternal mortality data, the official data source for maternal mortality

Maternal mortality is high in the United States and appears to be increasing, with large racial and 
ethnic disparities; questions about data quality limit interpretation of trends.
Introduction
Maternal mortality has long been seen as a primary indicator of the quality of health care 
both in the U.S. and internationally (1–5). The U.S. National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) 
is the source of official U.S. maternal mortality statistics used for subnational and 
international comparisons (6). To improve the identification of maternal deaths, a pregnancy 
question was added to the U.S. standard death certificate in 2003 (7). The question has 
checkboxes to ascertain whether female decedents were not pregnant within the past year, 
pregnant at the time of death, not pregnant but pregnant within 42 days of death, not 
pregnant but pregnant 43 days to 1 year before death, or unknown if pregnant within the past 
year (7). However, delays in states’ adoption of the new pregnancy question created 
problems for maternal mortality analysis, as data from states using the standard pregnancy 
question were not comparable with data from states with no pregnancy question or a non-
standard pregnancy question (7,8).
A previous paper provided estimates of US maternal mortality trends from 2000–2014 after 
adjustment for differences in the use of the pregnancy question among states (8). This paper 
extends the previous analysis by analyzing trends in maternal mortality for 27 states and 
Washington DC for the most recent 5-year period (2008–2009 to 2013–2014), by maternal 
age, race and ethnicity, and for detailed causes of death. The purpose was two-fold: 1) to 
identify trends and at-risk populations to assist in targeting prevention efforts; and 2) to 
begin to evaluate the data quality of vital statistics maternal mortality data, since this data 
has not been widely used.
Materials and Methods
We use the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of maternal death as the death of a 
woman while pregnant or within 42 days of the end of pregnancy, from any cause related to 
or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental 
causes (9). This is the definition used for international maternal mortality comparisons. Late 
maternal deaths are pregnancy-related deaths that occurred from 43 days to 1 year after the 
end of pregnancy (9).
United States maternal mortality data used for national and international comparisons are 
based on information reported on death certificates filed in state vital statistics offices, and 
subsequently compiled into national data through the National Vital Statistics System (6). 
Maternal mortality data used in this observational study were derived from the detailed 
mortality data files publically available from the National Center for Health Statistics, and 
also available through CDC-WONDER (10–11). Physicians, medical examiners or coroners

 are responsible for completing the medical portion of the death certificate, including the 
cause of death. From 1999 to the present, cause-of-death data in the United States have been 
coded according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) (6). Maternal deaths are denoted by codes A34, O00-
O95, O98-O99, while late maternal deaths are denoted by codes O96-O97 (7, 9). Maternal 
deaths are further subdivided into direct and indirect obstetric deaths (9). Direct obstetric 
deaths are deaths resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (pregnancy, 
labor and puerperium), from interventions, omissions, incorrect treatment, or from a chain of 
events resulting from any of the above (ICD-10 codes A34, O00-O92) (9). Indirect obstetric 
deaths are deaths resulting from previous existing disease, or disease that developed during 
pregnancy and which was not the result of direct obstetric causes, but which was aggravated 
by the physiological effects of pregnancy (O98-O99) (9). Deaths of unknown cause (O95) 
are not classified as either direct or indirect causes. In the United States, all death certificates 
of women identified by the pregnancy checkbox question as being pregnant at the time of 
death or within 42 days prior to death are coded as maternal deaths, except for deaths due to 
external causes of injury (i.e. accidents, homicide, suicide) (12–13).
We include the complete population of maternal deaths and live births for the 27 states and 
the District of Columbia that had adopted the US standard pregnancy question by January 1, 
2008 (8). Although revised to the U.S. standard question in 2006, Texas data will be 
examined in a separate paper, as it exhibited very different trends than the other states (8). 
Data from 2008–2009 was compared with data from 2013–2014, to analyze changes in 
maternal death during the most recent 5-year period. We analyzed data by maternal age (by 
5-year age groups and for women aged <40 and ≥40 years) race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic) and for detailed causes of death. The <.01% of records 
with missing age were excluded. Information on race was missing for <.04% of records and 
was imputed by the National Center for Health Statistics using procedures described 
elsewhere (6). Unknown cause of death (0.4% of cases in this study) is coded to a separate 
category (O95) and included as a separate category in the analysis.
We also analyzed trends for a grouping of non-specific “other” and unknown causes of 
death, including “Other specified pregnancy-related conditions” (O26.8), “Unknown cause” 
(O95) and “Other specified diseases and conditions complicating pregnancy, childbirth and 
the puerperium” (O99.8) (14). These categories are general categories where deaths that do 
not easily fit into the ICD maternal mortality coding rubric are classified; thus it is more 
difficult from a clinical perspective to determine the specific cause of death for these cases. 
Two-year averages of data were used to increase the number of cases available for detailed 
analysis, and to increase the reliability of the resulting estimates. As maternal death is a rare 
event, the number of cases was not sufficient to support individual state analysis, particularly 
when stratified by demographic characteristics and by cause of death. The 27-states and the 
District of Columbia included 45% of all U.S. births in 2008–2009 and in 2013–2014. 
Maternal mortality rates were computed per 100,000 live births. A two-proportion z-test was 
used to test for statistical significance in trends from 2008–2009 to 2013–2014 (15).
Finally, as a recent study found evidence of possible over-identification of pregnancy with 
the pregnancy checkbox (16), we did a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact of a

 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% level of over-reporting of pregnancy status with the pregnancy 
checkbox. We computed the number of non-maternal deaths to women from natural causes 
(excluding accidents, homicide and suicide) by 5-year age groups, and estimated how 
different levels of incorrect reporting of these deaths as maternal deaths would impact 
maternal mortality rates by age. The study was exempt from requiring institutional review 
board approval since the study was based on de-identified, aggregated data from U.S. 
government public-use data sets.
Results
The study population included 1,687 maternal deaths and 7,369,966 live births. The 
maternal mortality rate increased by 23% during the latest 5-year period in the District of 
Columbia and the 27 states with the revised pregnancy checkbox item. The maternal 
mortality rate rose from 20.6 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2008–2009 to 25.4 in 
2013–2014 (Figure 1) (p<.001).
Women aged 40 years and over had the highest maternal mortality rates, and the largest 
percent increase was from 2008–2009 to 2013–2014 (Table 1). In 2008–2009, the maternal 
mortality rate for women aged ≥40 was 141.9 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, 10 
times the rate of 14.1 for women aged 25–29, the lowest risk group (p<.001). By 2013–
2014, the maternal mortality rate for mothers aged ≥40 was 269.9, 18 times the rate of 14.7 
for 25–29 year olds (p<.001). This represents a 90% increase in the maternal mortality rate 
for mothers aged ≥40 during a 5-year period (p<.001). Although rates appeared to decline 
slightly for women under 25, and increase slightly for women aged 25–39, none of these 
changes were statistically significant. In fact, there was no statistically significant difference 
in the maternal mortality rate for women <40 across these two time periods (p=.38). The 
increase for ≥40 age group (p<.001) accounted for all of the overall increase in maternal 
deaths between the two time periods.
When examined by race and ethnicity, (Figure 1) the maternal mortality rate increased by 
28% for non-Hispanic white women, from 15.9 in 2008–2009 to 20.3 in 2013–2014 (p<.
001). For non-Hispanic black women, the rate increased from 46.7 in 2008–2009 to 56.3 in 
2013–2014 – an increase of 20% (p=.02). The maternal mortality rate for Hispanic women 
did not change significantly (15.1 in 2008–2009 and 15.8 in 2013–2014).
During both time periods, the maternal mortality rate for non-Hispanic black women was 
nearly 3 times the rate for non-Hispanic white women. In contrast, rates for Hispanic women 
were similar to those for non-Hispanic white women in 2008–9. However, by 2013–2014, 
the rate for Hispanic women was 22% lower (p=.02) than for non-Hispanic white women, 
due mostly to a large increase for non-Hispanic white women. When examined by maternal 
age, we found that almost all of the increase in maternal mortality for non-Hispanic white 
and non-Hispanic black women was among women aged ≥40 (data not shown).
From 20082009 to 2013–2014, maternal mortality rates increased by 19.7% for direct 
obstetric causes (p=.003), and by 56.7% for indirect obstetric causes (p<.001) (Table 2). 
Direct obstetric causes accounted for 2/3 (65.6%), and indirect causes 1/3 (32.4%) of

 maternal deaths in 2013–14. When the subcategories of direct obstetric deaths were 
examined, the only significant increases were for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, from a rate 
of 0.5 to 1.0 per 100,000 (p<.05), and for Other specified pregnancy-related conditions 
(O26.8), from a rate of 3.4 to 5.9 (p<.001). The sub-total category “Other obstetric 
complications” (which includes the two categories listed above) also showed an increase, but 
once the non-specific (O26.8) category was subtracted out, the rate was unchanged at 5.6 
during both time periods. The increase of 82 maternal deaths in the non-specific O26.8 
category accounted for almost two-thirds of the overall increase in maternal deaths (127) 
between 2008–2009 and 2013–2014.
Indirect obstetric causes increased by 54.4% from 20082009 to 20132014 (p<.001). 
However, the only specific sub-category under Indirect obstetric causes that showed a 
statistically significant increase was “Other specified diseases and conditions” (O99.8), 
which increased by 75.9% during the 5-year period (p<.001) and accounted for over one-
third of the increase in maternal deaths between the two time periods.
To further examine data quality issues, we developed a grouping of maternal deaths assigned 
to non-specific ‘other’ causes, combining other specified pregnancy-related conditions 
(O26.8), other specific diseases and conditions (O99.8) and obstetric death of unspecified 
cause (O95). Maternal mortality rates for this cause-of-death grouping increased by 47.9% 
from 7.0 in 2008–9 to 10.4 in 2013–14 (p<.001) (Table 3). There was an overall increase of 
127 maternal deaths across the two time periods, and the non-specific causes accounted for 
105 (83%) of them. When this group is subtracted out from the total maternal deaths, the 
increase in maternal mortality between 2008–2009 (13.5 per 100,000) and 2013–2014 (15.0 
per 100,000) was not statistically significant (p=.10).
Direct obstetric deaths increased by 19.7% from 2008–2009 to 2013–2014 (p=.003). 
However, when the non-specific category (O26.8) was subtracted out, the remaining 
category also did not increase significantly from 2008–9 (10.5 per 100,000) to 2013–14 
(10.7 per 100,000) (p=.75) (Table 3).
Indirect obstetric deaths increased by 56.7% from 2008–2009 to 2013–2014. When the non-
specific (O99.8) category was subtracted out, in this case, the remaining category still 
increased by 42.3% from 2008–9 (3.0 per 100,000) to 2013–14 (4.3 per 100,000) p<.01).
From 2008–9 to 2013–14, maternal mortality rates for women aged ≥40 nearly doubled 
among both specific and non-specific causes of death. For women <40, maternal mortality 
rates from non-specific causes increased by 26% during the period, while the rates for 
specific causes did not change significantly. In 2013–2014, maternal mortality rates from 
non-specific causes were 20 times higher for women ≥40 than for women <40, while among 
specific causes, rates were 12 times higher. In fact, for women aged ≥40 one-half of all 
maternal deaths were due to non-specific causes in 2013–2014. (Figure 2)
Finally, we did a sensitivity analysis to model the effect on maternal mortality rates of 
different levels of possible over-reporting of pregnancy or postpartum status with the 
pregnancy checkbox (Table 4). For example, we found that a 1% over-reporting of 
pregnancy or postpartum status increased reported maternal mortality rates by 14–23% for

 women in their twenties and early thirties. In contrast, the maternal mortality rate for women 
aged 40–54 more than tripled (232% increase) with a 1% false positive rate.
Discussion
The maternal mortality rate increased by 23% from 2008–2009 to 2013–2014 for a group of 
27 states and the District of Columbia that used the U.S. standard pregnancy question on 
their death certificates. From 2008–2009 to 2013–2014, the only significant increases in 
maternal mortality rates by maternal age groups were for women aged ≥40 years. For these 
women, maternal mortality rates in 2013–2014 were 18 times higher than for women aged 
25–29 years, the lowest risk group. In contrast, the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal 
Deaths in Great Britain found maternal mortality rates for women aged ≥40 to be 3–4 times 
higher than for women aged 25–29 (17). About 1/3 of maternal deaths in 2013–2014 were to 
women aged ≥40 years, compared to just 3% of live births, suggesting either a much greater 
mortality risk for women ≥40 or, more likely given this analysis, possible over-reporting of 
maternal deaths to older women.
Non-specific causes of death increased by 48% from 2008–2009 to 2013–2014, and 
accounted for 83% of the total increase in maternal mortality. In contrast, there was no 
significant increase among specific causes either for total maternal deaths or for direct 
obstetric causes, although indirect obstetric causes still increased. Large increases in 
maternal mortality rates for older women and among non-specific causes suggest possible 
data quality problems that may be worsening over time.
Using a checkbox question to report on rare events, such as maternal mortality, can be 
problematic as the checkbox might occasionally be inadvertently checked even if the woman 
is not pregnant or postpartum. The accuracy of the checkbox information is critical because 
identification of a death as maternal or non-maternal in US vital statistics data is based 
almost entirely on the checkbox information. The current coding rules are that unless the 
cause of death is an accident, suicide, or homicide, if the pregnancy or post-partum within 
42 days checkbox is checked, the record is coded as a maternal death, regardless of what is 
written in the cause-of-death section (12–13). This puts tremendous pressure on the 
pregnancy question as almost the sole determinant of whether the death is maternal or non-
maternal. However, until recently, there has been little quality control done on this data item.
We modeled the potential impact of over-reporting of pregnant or postpartum status with the 
pregnancy checkbox on maternal mortality rates. We found that a 1% false positive rate 
increased reported maternal mortality rates by 26% for women <40, but more than tripled 
them (232% increase) for women aged 40–54. When compared to younger women, women 
aged 40–54 years have higher death rates and much lower pregnancy rates, making the effect 
of false positives much larger for these women.
US coding practices for maternal deaths vary somewhat from those used in other countries. 
Although the ICD-10 recommends the use of a pregnancy checkbox, not all countries have 
adopted it, which can affect maternal mortality comparisons (8, 18). Also, recent WHO 
publications include suicides as maternal deaths, due to the possible etiologic link with 
MacDorman et al.

 depression (19, 20). Countries also vary in what are considered “incidental causes” in the 
maternal mortality definition. For example, in Great Britain, deaths from non-hormonally 
dependent, non-reproductive cancers are considered to be incidental and probably pre-
existing and are not classified as maternal deaths (21). Due to confusion over identifying 
“incidental” causes, beginning in 2016 WHO recommended adding a second pregnancy 
question, asking if the pregnancy contributed to the death (22), however, there are currently 
no plans to adopt this question in the United States.
Even if much of the reported increase is due to over-reporting, our core findings reflect 
several reasons for concern for U.S. policymakers and practitioners. First, even if we 
examine only direct causes of maternal mortality for mothers of all ages (15.0 per 100,000), 
or just women <40 years for any cause (17.8), these rates are much higher than for other 
industrialized countries (23). For example, the 2014 maternal mortality rate was 3.9 in the 
United Kingdom, 3.5 in France, and 2.2 in Sweden (23). Second, even limiting the analysis 
to women <40 or deaths from direct causes, we find the mortality rate is not decreasing, in 
contrast to most other countries (24–26). In 1990, the United Nations named maternal 
mortality reduction as a Millennium Development Goal (24), leading to an unprecedented 
effort to reduce maternal mortality worldwide. Maternal mortality decreased by 44% 
worldwide from 1990–2015, including a 48% decline among developed regions (25). In 
contrast, the US maternal mortality rate has not improved and appears to be increasing. (8).
The US vital statistics system provides useful information on maternal mortality. However, 
high and increasing maternal mortality rates for older mothers and among non-specific 
causes of death suggest possible data problems. Quality improvement efforts need to focus 
on improving the quality and validity of the pregnancy checkbox data. Periodic validation 
studies, and the implementation of data quality checks at both the state and national level are 
essential to improving reporting. State and Federal agencies should provide training to 
persons who complete death certificates, which emphasizes the importance of correct 
reporting of the pregnancy checkbox information. A percentage of records, including 100% 
of records for women ≥40 or coded to non-specific causes, should be routinely queried back 
to the certifier to confirm the fact of pregnancy. Given concerns about over-reporting with 
the pregnancy checkbox, it is illogical to continue to use it as the sole means of identifying 
maternal deaths. Further identifying and excluding incidental causes of death, as well as 
changes to coding to decrease the near-exclusive reliance on the checkbox to identify 
maternal deaths might improve data quality. Finally, the recent growth in state maternal 
mortality review committees can improve data quality (27), but only if information from 
maternal mortality reviews is used to update vital statistics information on the cause and 
circumstances of death.
