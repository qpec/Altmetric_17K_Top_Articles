Summary
In this study, results are reported from the analyses of vastus lateralis muscle biopsy
samples obtained from a subset (n = 90) of 125 previously phenotyped, highly
active male and female cyclists aged 55–79 years in regard to age. We then subse-
quently attempted to uncover associations between the findings in muscle and
in vivo physiological functions. Muscle fibre type and composition (ATPase histo-
chemistry), size (morphometry), capillary density (immunohistochemistry) and mito-
chondrial protein content (Western blot) in relation to age were determined in the
biopsy specimens. Aside from an age-related change in capillary density in males
(r = �.299; p = .02), no other parameter measured in the muscle samples showed
an association with age. However, in males type I fibres and capillarity (p < .05)
were significantly associated with training volume, maximal oxygen uptake, oxygen
uptake kinetics and ventilatory threshold. In females, the only association observed
was between capillarity and training volume (p < .05). In males, both type II fibre
proportion and area (p < .05) were associated with peak power during sprint cycling
and with maximal rate of torque development during a maximal voluntary isometric
contraction. Mitochondrial protein content was not associated with any cardiorespi-
ratory parameter in either males or females (p > .05). We conclude in this highly
active cohort, selected to mitigate most of the effects of inactivity, that there is lit-
tle evidence of age-related changes in the properties of VL muscle across the age
range studied. By contrast, some of these muscle characteristics were correlated
with in vivo physiological indices.

INTRODUCTION
Aging is associated with declines in multiple physiological systems
(Ferrari, Radaelli & Centola, 2003; Power, Dalton & Rice, 2013;
Sharma & Goodwin, 2006). Skeletal muscle in later life is typically
characterized by a loss of tissue mass (sarcopenia) and a decline in
contractile function (dynapenia) (Power et al., 2013). Anatomically
this has been attributed to a selective atrophy of fast-contracting

 type II muscle fibres (Andersen, 2003; Narici & Maffulli, 2010; Nilwik
et al., 2013) and a reduction in motor unit and muscle fibre number
(Hepple & Rice, 2016; Lexell, Henrikssonlarsen, Winblad & Sjostrom,
1983; Piasecki, Ireland, Jones & McPhee, 2016). Furthermore, char-
acteristics of the typical older muscle include a decline in muscle
quality as evidenced by infiltrations of fat and connective tissue
(Agley, Rowlerson, Velloso, Lazarus & Harridge, 2013; Hogrel et al.,
2015) and reduced muscle oxidative capacity, through a decline in
mitochondrial number and function (Ghosh et al., 2011; Lanza et al.,
2008; Rooyackers, Adey, Ades & Nair, 1996; Short et al., 2005) and
muscle capillarity (Coggan et al., 1992). However, because of the
complex interaction between aging per se and the decline in physical
activity with age in humans, the extent to which these changes in
muscle are driven by the underlying biological aging process remains
far from clear (Harridge & Lazarus, 2017). Indeed, many of the cur-
rent perceptions of the relationship between age and physiological
function, including musculoskeletal function, are based on results
from populations whose physical activity status and lifestyle are low
and/or are poorly characterized (Booth & Lees, 2006; Hawkins, Wis-
well & Marcell, 2003; Lazarus & Harridge, 2010). As our genetic
inheritance stems from a period when high levels of physical activity
were the likely norm (Booth & Lees, 2006), it has been argued that
being physically active is the default position required for maintain-
ing health and physical function throughout the lifespan (Booth &
Lees, 2006; Lazarus & Harridge, 2010).
To overcome these concerns, we (Pollock et al., 2015) recently
undertook a comprehensive phenotyping of a cohort of 125 male
and female cyclists aged 55–79 years, where training volume was
maintained with age, to examine the relationship between age and
physiological function. While acknowledging that genetic differences
between individuals may influence the aging trajectory, the genotype
of the cohort, albeit for only two common “performance” genotypes,
was similar to the general population and not skewed to an endur-
ance-based phenotype (Pollock et al., 2015). Here, we report further
results from this cohort of highly active individuals where we have
analysed muscle biopsy samples (n = 90) obtained from the vastus
lateralis (VL) muscle. Fibre type composition, fibre sizes, capillary
density and mitochondrial protein characteristics were examined in
relation to age. Our hypothesis was that in these individuals who
showed similar high levels of physical activity (Pollock et al., 2015),
any changes associated with age could be ascribed to an inherent
aging process not confounded by inactivity. Furthermore, these
properties of the VL were also examined in relation to a selection of
relevant in vivo physiological characteristics of the participants asso-
ciated with either aerobic (e.g. VO2max) or explosive muscle function.

Relation between age and vastus lateralis
characteristics
Examples of the ATPase staining for a 71- and 59-year-old individual
are shown in Figure 1a. The examples shown are representative of
the entire cohort. In general, the ATPase staining revealed regularly
shaped polyhedral cells with a morphology similar to that expected
in a healthy young individual. Overall, there were negligible numbers
of type IIx and IIc fibres as indicated by an average of 1 fibre identi-
fied per subject. For the cohort as a whole, the proportion of fibre
types was typical of a slower phenotype, with 68.3 � 1.2% type I
fibres, and the fast fibres being almost exclusively type IIA. For both
sexes, there was no age-related change in the proportion or area of
type I or II fibres (Figure 1d–e; p > .05 in all cases) and no effect of
age on the CSA of either type I or II muscle fibres (Figure 1c;
p > .05).
With regard to capillarity, there was a linear decline in capillary
density (Figure 2b) with age in males (r = �.299; p = .02), but not in
females (p > .05). There was no relationship between age and capil-
lary-to-fibre ratio, capillary contacts and capillary contacts of type I
and II fibres in either gender (Figure 2c–d; p > .05 in all cases).
Western blotting analysis of mitochondrial complex proteins (CI,
CII, CIII, CIV and CV) revealed no age-related effects in either males
or females (p > .05 in all cases; Figure 3).

Relation between characteristics of the VL
and physiological function
Given that little or no association was observed between properties
of the biopsy samples and age, the properties of the muscle were
evaluated in relation to physiological characteristics of the partici-
pants, as previously reported (Pollock et al., 2015), irrespective of
age.
A summary of the mean values obtained for each physiological
function assessed is shown in Table 1, and the results of the correla-
tion analysis (r- and p-values) are summarized in Table 2 and
Table 3.
The monthly distance cycled by male subjects was weakly but
significantly

with
type

fibre

and
area
(r = .195 and .212, respectively, p < .05; Table 2). There was a linear
relationship between the monthly distance cycled and capillary-to-
fibre ratio and capillary density in females, while there was only a
tendency towards this with capillary density in males (r = .160;
p = .076). A linear relationship existed between the monthly distance
cycled and complex I protein content in males only (r = .263,
p = .032; Table 2).
In regard to cardiorespiratory parameters, VO2max and O2 uptake
kinetics were found to be positively correlated with type I fibre pro-
portion and area in males (Table 2). Ventilatory threshold also
increased linearly with the proportion of type I fibres in males. There
were no associations between cardiorespiratory parameters and type
I fibre characteristics in females (p > .05 in all cases).
VO2max linearly increased with capillary density and capillary-to-
fibre ratio in males (Table 2), while capillary density, capillary-to-fibre
ratio and capillary contacts all linearly increased with ventilatory
threshold in males (Table 2). O2 uptake kinetics were negatively cor-
related with capillary density, capillary contacts and type II fibre cap-
illary contacts (Table 2) in males, while there was a tendency

 towards this with capillary density in females (r = �.218; p = .09).
No significant associations between capillarity and cardiorespiratory
parameters were found in females (p > .05).
Mitochondrial complex protein content was not associated with
any cardiorespiratory parameter in either males or females (p > .05
in all cases).
With regard to strength/power-related parameters and type II
fibre characteristics (Table 3), PP and RTD2/3 were found to be pos-
itively, but weakly (r = .174 to .278; p < .05), associated with type II
fibre proportion and area in males. No other associations between
strength/power parameters and type II fibre characteristics were
found in males or females (p > .05).

DISCUSSION
Our understanding of the aging process is confounded by many
factors, including genetic variation and differences in socio-eco-
nomic, healthcare and nutritional status and, crucially, the physical
activity status of experimental participants (Lazarus & Harridge,
2010; Metter et al., 1999). In many studies, data are obtained from
those in whom physiological function is influenced not only by the
aging process, but also by an interaction with negative lifestyle fac-
tors, including sedentary behaviour (Booth & Lees, 2006; Hawkins
et al., 2003; Lazarus & Harridge, 2010). To remove physical inactiv-
ity as a confounding factor, we have recently investigated the
physiological characteristics of a group of highly active older indi-
viduals (Pollock et al., 2015), with this group of cyclists having
activity levels considerably above that likely to be required to off-
set the negative effects of inactivity (Lazarus & Harridge, 2017). It
may be possible that an unknown intrinsic factor facilitates the
ability of these amateur cyclists to participate in noncompetitive
long-distance events; however, in the context of experimental pro-
cedures at our disposal, we have not been able to uncover such a
factor.
In our original investigation where studies were confined to
in vivo physiological measurements (Pollock et al., 2015), we found
that strong associations between age and physiological function
were not observed, in males or females, for the majority of variables,
including no association between age and appendicular muscle mass

 (skeletal muscle mass index, SMI) determined from a dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. The aims of this study were two-
fold. The first was to focus our observations on the relationship
between age and a number of properties (fibre type distribution and
sizes, capillarity and mitochondrial complex protein composition) of
skeletal muscle analysed from biopsy samples taken from the VL
muscle. Here, the results in both males and females revealed no
association between the characteristics of the VL and the age of the
donor with the exception of capillary density in males. The second
was to correlate the properties of the VL with those in vivo physio-
logical indices which could be expected to be influenced by the
known characteristics of the different fibre types. Here, a number of
associations were observed in males, but not females.

Fibre type distribution and size
Histological images of sections of the VL processed using ATPase
histochemistry (Figure 1) show regularly shaped polyhedral muscle
cells with an overall morphology that is typically associated with
healthy young individuals rather than older muscle. The morphology
of an older muscle would typically be characterized by having type II
fibre atrophy (Snijders, Verdijk & van Loon, 2009) and angular fibres,
as well as often showing infiltrations of fat and connective tissue
(Agley et al., 2013; Andersen, 2003; Hogrel et al., 2015). In our older
cyclists with maintained high levels of endurance exercise, the pre-
dominance of type I fibres (67.7% and 69.6% for males and females,
respectively) was as expected for this endurance-trained phenotype.
We observed no relation between age and fibre type distribution,
while the number of type IIc fibres (i.e. those co-expressing both
slow and fast myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms) identified histo-
logically was negligible. A higher number of fibres co-expressing
MHC isoforms has been reported in the muscles of older people
(Klitgaard et al., 1990a). In this regard, it has been suggested that
while there is a well-documented decline in type II muscle fibre size,
if there is an age-related conversion of fibre type, then an atrophy
of type I fibres may also occur and may have been underestimated
in aging populations (Purves-Smith, Solbak, Rowan & Hepple, 2012).
However, in the present investigation, while the female cyclists had
significantly smaller fibres than the males, no correlation with age
was observed for either sex or for either type I or type II fibres.
This finding is in contrast to a similar cross-sectional study on
active people, who were sprinters not cyclists, aged 18–84 years
(Korhonen et al., 2006), where an age-related loss of type II fibre
size was reported. Previously, Klitgaard et al. (1990b) had shown a
maintenance of type II fibre size in the leg muscles of older strength
trained males (aged 69 years) compared to the sedentary, but no
maintenance of type II fibres in older endurance runners or swim-
mers. In another study comparing older people who regularly partici-
pate in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity three times a week
(aged 71 years), a decline in type II fibre size was also observed. The
lack of consistency in findings across studies may be explained in
part by differences in the age ranges studied, exercise type and age-
related changes to training intensity and volume that may occur
between cohorts (Pollock, Foster, Knapp, Rod & Schmidt, 1987;
Tanaka & Seals, 2003). In the present study, the cohort of cyclists
spanned a relatively narrow age range (55–79 years), but no age-
related reduction in reported training volume was reported.

Capillarity
Endurance exercise has a well-documented effect of improving both
local oxygen delivery, through angiogenesis, and oxygen utilization,
through mitochondrial biogenesis (Hawley, 2002; Lundby & Jacobs,
2016). In regard to local O2 delivery, there was no difference in the

 number of capillaries between males and females when expressed as
number per fibre, but when expressed per unit area, the females had
a higher capillary density. This phenomenon could be explained by
the significantly smaller fibres of the female cyclists and gives a
potential physiological advantage in terms of a lower distance for O2
diffusion into contracting muscle fibres. In the females, we observed
no association with any measure of capillarity and age, but we did
observe a negative correlation between age and density (capillaries
per mm2) in the males. As muscle fibre size was unchanged with age
and in light of a maintained training volume, the declining capillary
density in males could thus be attributed to the aging process and
not to an interaction of aging with inactivity. However, the r2 value
for this correlation was low with only 8.9% of the variance in capil-
lary density explained by age. Furthermore, as no other measures of
capillarity were found to be associated with age, the physiological
relevance of this weak association remains unclear. In a previous

 study, older trained males were shown to have a similar capillary
density to young trained males (Proctor, Sinning, Walro, Sieck &
Lemon, 1995). Furthermore, while we cannot fully explain the dis-
crepancy in the capillary density–age association between males and
females, it may be related to the sex-specific role of androgens in
angiogenesis and the declining androgen levels typically observed
with age (Sieveking et al., 2010).

Mitochondrial complex protein content
In a study of sedentary people, Short et al. (2005) observed an age-
related decline in mitochondrial protein content and ATP production
in a cross-sectional study across a wide age range of participants
(18–89 years). Master athletes, however, are known to have superior
mitochondrial enzyme activity and aerobic capacity compared to
sedentary individuals of the same age (Coggan et al., 1993; Proctor
et al., 1995) and also have significantly greater expression of mito-
chondrial proteins involved in key metabolic processes in skeletal
muscle (Lanza et al., 2008). In the present study, we measured the
protein concentrations of mitochondrial complexes I–V, but observed
no declines as a result of age, suggesting that with high levels of
activity, mitochondrial dysfunction with age may be minimal. A dis-
sociation between mitochondrial protein content and mitochondrial
respiratory function has recently been reported (Spendiff et al.,
2016); however, we were unable to explore this feature because res-
piratory measurements were not possible on our frozen biopsy sam-
ples. In this regard, a recent study by Distefano et al. (2017)
reported no age associations with either mitochondrial respiration or
protein content, although they were related to the level of cardiores-
piratory fitness irrespective of age, a point we explore further below.

Relation between muscle properties and
physiological function
3.2.1
|
Aerobic capability
While
acknowledging
that
multiple
physiological
processes
are
involved in whole-body exercise, the second aim of the study was to
investigate the relationship between the properties of the VL muscle
and a number of relevant physiological indices we have previously
reported (Pollock et al., 2015). Endurance exercise is closely coupled
to aerobic metabolism and thus associated with the generic proper-
ties of slow-oxidative, type I muscle fibres. The predominance of
type I fibres in the VL muscle of our male and female cyclists was
thus not surprising. In the male cyclists, we observed that the pro-
portion of type I fibres and capillarity were associated with a number
of in vivo physiological indices pertaining to aerobic exercise func-
tion: VO2max, ventilatory threshold and oxygen uptake kinetics.
These properties of the VL were also associated with training vol-
ume to which mitochondrial complex protein I was also associated.
These relationships might simply be explained by the known effects
of endurance training commonly observed on skeletal muscle oxida-
tive capacity in young adults (Gjøvaag & Dahl, 2008; Hepple,
Mackinnon, Goodman, Thomas & Plyley, 1997; Holloszy & Coyle,
1984) and the role that these have in influencing endurance cycling
performance and aerobic power (Bassett & Howley, 2000). The find-
ings relating to oxygen uptake kinetics are in general agreement with
previous research indicating that the association between oxygen
uptake kinetics and type I fibres is in part due to a greater capillarity
of type I fibres which reduces the variability in blood flow to, and
the transit time through, the working muscle at the onset of exercise
(Piiper, 1990; Pringle et al., 2003). Despite the strongest association
of the entire study being between oxygen uptake kinetics and type I
fibre area, this only explained 17% of the variance in oxygen uptake
kinetics, further highlighting the complexity of comparing in vivo
physiological function to single in vitro measurements.
In contrast to capillarity, there was no association between mito-
chondrial protein complex content and in vivo physiological function,
although, as discussed above, an association between mitochondrial
respiratory capacity and in vivo cardiorespiratory fitness has previ-
ously been shown (Distefano et al., 2017). Interestingly, when study-
ing isolated muscle groups, O2 delivery to the working muscle has
been identified as a main factor limiting VO2max in endurance-trained
individuals (Richardson et al., 1999) in contrast to mitochondrial
function in sedentary individuals (Haseler, Lin & Richardson, 2004).
This possible difference in delivery and utilization between athletes
and the sedentary, coupled with a dissociation between mitochon-
drial protein content and mitochondrial respiratory function (Spendiff
et al., 2016), may contribute to a lack of association between mito-
chondrial complex protein content and markers of aerobic function
in the present study.
In contrast to males, there was no association between any char-
acteristic of the VL and the physiological indices measured in the
female
cyclists,
although
a
positive
association
was
observed
between training volume and capillary density and capillary-to-fibre
ratio. The differences in male and females with regard to these asso-
ciations are difficult to explain with certainty, but will be partly influ-
enced by the higher r2 required to achieve statistical significance in
the lower number of females (n = 30) studied compared to males
(n = 60).
3.2.2
|
In vivo muscle function
In contrast to endurance exercise, explosive physical activities
require the rapid generation of force and high power outputs. These
are properties of muscle that are associated with the faster molecu-
lar motor of type IIa and IIx MHC isoform-containing fibres (Bot-
tinelli, Canepari, Pellegrino & Reggiani, 1996; Harridge et al., 1996;
Pearson, Cobbold, Orrell & Harridge, 2006) and highlight the addi-
tional problem for power generation for many older people caused
by a selective atrophy of fast-contracting type II fibres. In this
regard, in the male cyclists both type II fibre proportion and area
were associated with peak power output during sprint cycling (nor-
malized to lower limb muscle mass) and with the rate of torque
development during a maximum voluntary contraction in the male
subjects. While there is evidence from single fibre experiments
POLLOCK ET AL.
|
7 of 12
 (Bottinelli et al., 1996) that type II fibres have a high force per unit
area, no association between composition and maximal isometric
knee extensor force (when normalized to lower limb fat-free mass)
was observed. The lack of association is likely explained by the fact
that multiple factors interact to determine maximal strength in vivo
(O’Brien, Reeves, Baltzopoulos, Jones & Maganaris, 2010). Interest-
ingly, a component of rate of force development (RTD2/3) during
the isometric contraction was related to fibre type composition, but
only in the males. Furthermore, this was significantly faster in
females compared to the males. This observation is difficult to
explain with certainty as the rate of force development is influenced
by factors in addition to cellular processes within the muscle, such
as neural drive and the stiffness of series elastic components (Maffi-
uletti et al., 2016). Females tend to have lower tendon stiffness than
males, and stiffness has also been shown to decline with age in
males, both of which would reduce RTD (Kubo, Kanehisa & Fuku-
naga, 2003; Narici & Maganaris, 2006; Quinlan et al., 2017), while
by contrast exercise training can have the effect of increasing ten-
don stiffness (Kubo, Kanehisa, Miyatani, Tachi & Fukunaga, 2003;
Reeves, Narici & Maganaris, 2003). As the interaction between
inherent aging, training status, sex and tendon stiffness is complex,
this may partly explain the sex difference observed.

CONCLUSION
The current study examined the relationship between the proper-
ties of the VL muscle and both age and appropriate relevant
physiological indices in a cohort of highly active male and female
cyclists aged 55–79 years. Our contention was that these individu-
als represented a model of inherent healthy, active aging, free
from the confounding negative effects of sedentary behaviour.
With the exception of capillary density in males, no association
between age and any other property of the VL was observed in
either males or females, while a number of associations were
observed between the properties of VL of the muscle and indices
of physiological and exercise training volume. Overall, these data
show no age-related deterioration in selected properties of the VL
muscle which are relevant to aerobic function or explosive muscle
power, but are more closely related to an individual’s level of
function irrespective of their age. The data support the view that
high levels of exercise training are able to maintain many of the
properties of muscle which are negatively affected by aging when
it is accompanied by sedentary behaviour.

Ethical approval
Prior to participation, written informed consent was obtained from
all subjects. Procedures were approved by the National Health Ser-
vice Wandsworth Research Ethics Committee (reference number 12/
LO/0457) and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. All human
tissues were collected, stored and analysed in accordance with the
Human Tissue Act.

Design
A cross-sectional study evaluating physiological function in a group
of amateur nonelite cyclists aged 55–79 was previously conducted
(Pollock et al., 2015). Data were obtained from a subgroup of sub-
jects, who at the time of the original study had a muscle biopsy
taken. Of 125 participants, 60 males and 30 females agreed to the
biopsy procedure (Table 4). For full details of subject selection, see
Pollock et al. (2015). Briefly, subjects were healthy, as defined by
Greig et al. (1994), 55- to 79-year-old amateur endurance cyclists.
The primary inclusion criteria were that males could cycle 100 km in
under 6.5 hr and females 60 km in under 5.5 hr and that this had
been done twice in the previous 3 weeks. On average, the subjects
of the current cohort had been active cyclists for 26 � 2 years. All
testing was performed over 2 days.

Body composition
A stadiometer and balance beam scale were used to determine
height and mass. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Hologic
Discovery A; Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA) was performed to deter-
mine whole-body and appendicular fat and fat-free mass.

 analysis was mounted in an embedding medium and frozen in liquid
nitrogen-cooled isopentane, while another part was immediately fro-
zen in liquid nitrogen for protein analysis. Biopsies were stored at
�80°C until analysis was performed. A cryostat chilled to �20°C
was used to cut serial sections (10 lm) which were mounted and
stained for myofibrillar ATPase activity. Sections were incubated at a
pH of 10.2, 4.6 and 4.3, after which fibres were classified as either
type I, IIa, IIc (i.e. hybrid fibres co-expressing I+II) or IIx. Due to the
minimal number of IIx fibres identified (on average 2% with one-
third of subjects having no identifiable IIx fibres), IIa and IIx fibres
were combined in a single type II category. On average, one type IIc
fibre per subject was found, and therefore, type IIc fibres were
excluded from further analysis. Muscle fibre cross-sectional area
(CSA) was determined from areas in good transverse section pho-
tographed with a known magnification, calibrated and measured
using a digitizing tablet and IMAGEJ software (v 1.45k). The percent-
age area of the muscle sample, used as an estimate of the whole
muscle taken up by type I and II fibres, was calculated by multiplying
the percentage distribution of each fibre type by its mean CSA and
then dividing by the total measured area of both fibre types. The
mean (SD) number of muscle fibres used to determine fibre propor-
tions and fibre CSA was 245 � 79 and 93 � 36, respectively.

Muscle capillarization
Capillary identification was performed on sections that were fixed in
paraformaldehyde (4%), air-dried and incubated at room temperature
with primary antibodies directed against platelet endothelial cell
adhesion molecule (PECAM-1 (aka CD31), dilution 1:500; Cell Signal-
ing Technology, MA, USA) and BA-F8 (dilution 1:30; DSHB, Univer-
sity of Iowa, USA) to stain endothelial cells and muscle fibres
containing myosin heavy chain (MHC) I, respectively. After incuba-
tion for 48 hr, slides were washed with PBS (5 9 2 min). Appropri-
ate secondary antibodies were applied: goat anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa
Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594 (dilution 1:1,000
and 1:1,500, respectively; Invitrogen, CA, USA). After a final wash,
slides were mounted with a coverslip using gold antifade mountant
with DAPI (Cell Signaling Technology). Staining procedures resulted
in endothelial cells stained in green, MHC-I red and nuclei blue. All
images were captured digitally using fluorescence microscopy (Apo-
Tome; Carl Zeiss, Germany). Image processing was performed using
AxioVision Software (Carl Zeiss) with subsequent quantitative analy-
sis performed using IMAGEJ software. Capillary-to-fibre ratio (C/F) was
determined by identifying a region of each section, which only
included whole muscle fibres and was free from holes or other irreg-
ularities. To adjust the C/F for capillaries located on the outside
edge of this region, the number of capillaries on the outside edge
was divided by 2 before being added to the number of capillaries
located on the inner region (Jacobs et al., 2016). This capillary num-
ber was divided by the total number of fibres in the region to deter-
mine the C/F. Also, the average number of capillaries contacting a
fibre (CC) and the average number of capillaries contacting specifi-
cally type I or II fibres (CCI and CCII, respectively) were calculated.
Finally, capillary density (CD) was determined in the area used for
C/F estimation with a normalization factor applied so that results
could be expressed as CD per mm2.

Mitochondrial protein
Protein content of mitochondrial complexes I–V was obtained from
frozen VL muscle which was homogenized using FastPrep-24TM5G
(Millipore, QuickPrep setting, 5 cycles), with the addition of 100 ll
ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM NaVO4, 50 mM NaF,
0.10% DTT and 0.50% protease inhibitor cocktail). Total protein con-
tent was derived from a Bio-Rad DCTM protein assay (Lot# 500-
0113) using FLUOstar Omega at absorbance 750 nm. Laemmli sam-
ple buffer was added prior to loading equal amounts of sample
(19.95 lg protein) onto SDS polyacrylamide gels (0.75 mm thickness,
12.5% acrylamide), which were subjected to a constant current of
23 mA/gel for ~45 min at room temperature.
Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a pure
nitrocellulose blotting membrane (PALL�; Pall Corporation, Life
Sciences) at 100 V for 1 hr, with the addition of transfer buffer
(0.4 mM Tris base, 1.73 mM glycine) and ice. Following blocking in
3% milk in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline+0.1% Tween), the membranes
were incubated overnight at 4°C with total OXPHOS human WB
antibody cocktail (Abcam, ab110411), diluted 1:1,000. This was fol-
lowed by washing in TBS-T and incubation with secondary antibody
(rabbit anti-mouse IgG, Pierce #31457, diluted 1:10,000). Immobilon
Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Merck Millipore) was
used to quantify protein content after IgG binding and visualized on
a G:BOX Chemi XT4 imager using GENESYS CAPTURE software (Syngene
UK, Cambridge, UK). Quantification of bands was corrected to the
actin band derived from the Ponceau S stain, performed following
protein transfer, and by the loading control for each gel.

Physiological measures
For full details of each of the remaining physiological indices mea-
sured, see Pollock et al. (2015). Brief details are given below.
5.5.1
|
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and ventilatory threshold (VT) were
determined during a continuous progressive exercise test on a cycle
ergometer (Lode Corival; Lode, Groningen, the Netherlands), during
which breath-by-breath O2 and CO2 concentrations and volume of
expired air were continuously recorded (Oxycon Pro; CareFusion,
UK). After a 3-min warm-up, cycling at 50 W, power output was
continually increased (1–2 W every 3–5 s customized to each sub-
ject so that maximal effort would be achieved within 10–12 min)
until the subject could no longer continue despite strong verbal
encouragement. VO2max was determined as the greatest O2 uptake
achieved over a 20-s period at the end of the test. VT was deter-
mined using a combination of the ventilatory equivalent method and

 v-slope method. VO2max and VT are reported as millilitres of O2
uptake per kilogram of fat-free mass per minute.
5.5.2
|
O2 uptake kinetics
O2 uptake kinetics were measured using the same set-up as for the
VO2max testing with a square-wave protocol conducted twice. Each
test began with subjects cycling at 20 W for 6 min followed by a
step increase in power output, to that which elicited 80% of the
VO2 recorded at VT, lasting 6 min. A custom-written program was
used to analyse the O2 uptake data that were collected to allow
determination of the time constant (s) of the response to the step
increase in power output. This was performed in a similar manner to
that described by Rossiter et al. (2002) with full details of the data
handling reported in Pollock et al. (2015).
5.5.3
|
Knee extensor strength
Maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the dominant leg knee
extensors were performed in a custom-built dynamometer with
the subjects seated upright, arms folded and the knee in 90° of
flexion.
Their
lower
leg,
~3 cm
proximal
to
the
ankle,
was
strapped to a padded steel brace attached to a strain gauge, with
the distance from the knee joint centre of rotation to the ankle
brace recorded. Subjects performed six MVCs during which force
was developed as quickly as possible with the contraction held
for 3–4 s. Visual feedback of the force trace was provided in
addition to strong verbal encouragement. The maximum torque
recorded across all six MVCs was determined and normalized to
the fat-free mass of the dominant limb. In addition, the maximum
rate of torque development (RTD) was determined from the slope
of the torque–time curve normalized to the relative peak torque
in a manner similar to that described by Aagaard, Simonsen,
Andersen, Magnusson and Dyhre-Poulsen (2002). RTD, expressed
as a %MVC/s, was calculated from the onset of contraction to
one-sixth, one-half and two-thirds of MVC. The onset of contrac-
tion was determined from the point where torque exceeded 2.5%
of MVC.
5.5.4
|
Peak explosive power
Peak explosive power (PP), recorded during a 5-s sprint on a cus-
tom-built inertial testing stationary cycle (Pearson, Cobbold & Har-
ridge, 2004), was determined. Subjects performed a 5-min warm-up
cycling at 50 W. Three maximal sprints were performed from a start-
ing position where the crank for the dominant leg was vertical at the
top of the pedal stroke. An inertial load of 0.325 kg/m2 was used
for testing. The peak power and velocity at peak power (Vopt)
achieved during each sprint were calculated offline using a custom-
written program (Matlab R2013a; The MathWorks, USA). The great-
est PP recorded was normalized to the fat-free mass of the lower
limbs and used for subsequent analysis.
5.6
|
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS STATISTICS v21 (Chi-
cago, IL, USA). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to assess the
normality of the data. For normally distributed data, the relationship
between age and the muscle characteristics was assessed by Pear-
son’s correlation coefficient, while for data that were not normally
distributed, Kendall’s tau correlation was performed. The same statis-
tical tests were used to determine whether any relationship existed
between the muscle fibre characteristics and indices of muscular
function/cardiorespiratory fitness, and only those relationships that
were found to be statistically significant are reported. Relationships
between age and indices of muscular function/cardiorespiratory fit-
ness have previously been reported (Pollock et al., 2015). An alpha
level of .05 was used for all analyses. All values are presented as
mean � SE unless otherwise stated. When discussing r-values, the
following criteria were used to indicate the strength of the associa-
tion: r = .8–1, very strong; r = .6–.79, strong; r = .4–.59, moderate;
r = .2–.39, weak; and r = 0–.19, very weak.
