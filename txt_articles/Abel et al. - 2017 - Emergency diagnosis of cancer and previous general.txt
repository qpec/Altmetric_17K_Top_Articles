 INTRODUCTION
Evidence from several countries documents 
that many patients with cancer are diagnosed 
through 
an 
emergency 
presentation 
(hereafter, the term ‘emergency presenters’ 
is used for these patients).1–4 As emergency 
presentations are associated with poorer 
survival and worse patient experience, 
reducing their frequency is desirable, 
but how to achieve such reductions is 
uncertain.5–8 Complex aetiologies, reflecting 
different disease (tumour), patient, and 
healthcare factors, often in combination, 
are likely to be implicated.9–11 Prior evidence 
indicates that older patients and patients 
who are more socioeconomically deprived 
are at substantially higher risk of diagnosis 
of cancer as an emergency.1,3,4 An ecological 
study indicates a degree of variation by 
certain general practice characteristics, 
but overall there is very limited evidence 
about whether and how diagnoses of cancer 
through an emergency presentation can be 
avoided.11,12
A key consideration is whether emergency 
presentations were preceded by patient 
contact with the healthcare system. Some 
emergency presenters would have had no 
such prior contact. This can occur either 
when dramatic (life-threatening) clinical 
presentations are preceded by minimal or 
short-lived symptoms, making emergency 
presentations 
practically 
unavoidable 
(indeed representing optimal care); or 
when patients have experienced, often mild, 
symptoms for a long time but have not 
sought medical help until sudden changes 
in the nature or severity of their symptoms 
prompted them to do so in an emergency 
context.9,10 Practical (for example, access), 
cognitive (for example, symptom awareness), 
or emotional (for example, fear of cancer 
diagnosis) factors may all act as barriers to 
help seeking.
Other emergency presenters would have 
sought medical help for their symptoms 
previously (often in primary care), but either 
referrals or investigations were not initiated; 
or a diagnostic process was instigated but 
sudden subsequent changes in symptom 
nature or severity led to an emergency 
presentation.9,10 Additionally, emergency 
presentations may result from contact with 
a GP who then directly refers the patient as 
an emergency to the hospital.13

a recent in-depth review of the diagnosis 
of cancer as an emergency, evidence on

Abstract
Background
Emergency diagnosis of cancer is common 
and aetiologically complex. The proportion of 
emergency presenters who have consulted 
previously with relevant symptoms is uncertain.
Aim
To examine how many patients with cancer, 
who were diagnosed as emergencies, have had 
previous primary care consultations with relevant 
symptoms; and among those, to examine how 
many had multiple consultations.
Design and setting
Secondary analysis of patient survey data from 
the 2010 English Cancer Patient Experience 
Survey (CPES), previously linked to population-
based data on diagnostic route.
Method
For emergency presenters with 18 different 
cancers, associations were examined for two 
outcomes (prior GP consultation status; and 
‘three or more consultations’ among prior 
consultees) using logistic regression. 
Results
Among 4647 emergency presenters, 1349 
(29%) reported no prior consultations, being 
more common in males (32% versus 25% in 
females, P<0.001), older (44% in ≥85 versus 
30% in 65–74-year-olds, P<0.001), and 
the most deprived (35% versus 25% least 
deprived, P = 0.001) patients; and highest/
lowest for patients with brain cancer (46%) and 
mesothelioma (13%), respectively (P<0.001 for 
overall variation by cancer site). Among 3298 
emergency presenters with prior consultations, 
1356 (41%) had three or more consultations, 
which were more likely in females (P<0.001), 
younger (P<0.001), and non-white patients 
(P = 0.017) and those with multiple myeloma, and 
least likely for patients with leukaemia (P<0.001).
Conclusion
Contrary to suggestions that emergency 
presentations represent missed diagnoses, about 
one-third of emergency presenters (particularly 
those in older and more deprived groups) have 
no prior GP consultations. Furthermore, only 
about one-third report multiple (three or more) 
consultations, which are more likely in ‘harder-
to-suspect’ groups.

Emergency diagnosis of cancer and previous 
general practice consultations:
insights from linked patient survey data
e377  British Journal of General Practice, June 2017
 the proportion of emergency presenters 
with and without previous consultations is 
very limited.11 This study aimed to examine 
variation (by patient characteristic and 
cancer site) in the presence and number 
of prior consultations with a GP among 
emergency presenters, to provide insights 
into aetiological mechanisms responsible 
for such presentations.
METHOD
Data
A secondary analysis was performed of 
data from the 2010 English Cancer Patient 
Experience Survey (CPES), previously linked 
to information about diagnostic ‘route’ (see 
below) as part of a national report on cancer 
patient experience.8,14
The patient survey was commissioned 
by the UK Department of Health and 
carried out by Quality Health, a specialist 
survey provider.12 The sampling frame 
included patients aged ≥16 years with a 
cancer diagnosis, seen as inpatients or 
day cases in English NHS hospitals during 
January–March 2010. After vital status 
checks, patients were sent the survey 
questionnaire by post a few weeks after 
their treatment, with up to two reminders for 
non-responders.
Analyses were restricted to responders 
who were emergency presenters, based on 
data linkage with the Routes to Diagnosis 
dataset, carried out previously by the Public 
Health England (former) National Cancer 
Intelligence Network to support public 
reporting 
of 
data 
on 
cancer 
patient 
experience 
(Appendix 1).8 Diagnostic ‘routes’ represent 
different care pathways to cancer diagnosis.1 
The emergency presentation route denotes 
new diagnosis of cancer following accident 
and emergency department attendance, 
emergency hospital admission, emergency 
between-hospital transfer, or emergency 
GP referral (operational definitions have 
been detailed previously).1
Outcomes. Variation 
was 
examined 
in respect of two outcomes: First, prior 
consultation status, that is whether 
emergency presenters had no prior GP 
consultations; and, second, ‘multiple’ 
consultation status, that is whether 
emergency presenters who had seen a 
GP had three or more consultations. Both 
outcomes were defined using information 
from the first survey question: ‘Before you 
were told you needed to go to hospital about 
cancer, how many times did you see your 
GP (family doctor) about the health problem 
caused by cancer?’. Informative response 
options included ‘None — I did not see 
my GP before going to hospital’ (denoting 
‘no prior GP consultation’ in the analysis) 
and ‘Once’, ‘Twice’, ‘Three or four times’, 
and ‘Five or more times’ (the latter two 
categories used to denote ‘three or more’ 
consultations among patients reporting at 
least one consultation).
The latter outcome was dichotomised 
(three or more versus one to two 
consultations), consistent with public 
reporting conventions for this survey, 
and because some repeat (second) 
appointments are generated by the need to 
review the results of investigations ordered 
at an initial consultation. The number of pre-
diagnostic consultations is associated with 
the primary care interval (number of days 
between presentation in primary care and 
referral), with primary care intervals of 34, 
47, and 97 days for the average patient with 
three, four, and ‘five or more’ consultations, 
respectively.15
Exposures. These included patients’ age 
group, sex, deprivation group, and cancer 
site using the International Classification 
of Diseases 10th edition (based on hospital 
records information included in the CPES 
dataset); and self-reported ethnic group 
(derived from survey responses) using a 
binary white/non-white variable because 
of the small numbers in minority ethnic 
How this fits in
Diagnosis of cancer as an emergency has 
been considered to represent ‘a failure of 
primary care’. Evidence to support such 
assertions is, however, limited. A notable 
minority of all emergency presenters 
have no prior contact with primary care, 
particularly males, older, and more 
deprived patients, and those with brain 
cancer
. Among emergency presenters who 
have seen a GP, multiple consultations 
occur in a minority and are driven by 
diagnostic difficulty.
Box 1. Prior hypotheses
It was a priori hypothesised that the symptom signature of different cancers would be the main driver of 
variation by cancer
. Specifically, it was hypothesised that in respect of symptom signatures: 
•  
Emergency presenters with cancers that often present acutely with symptoms deemed a clinical 
emergency (for example, seizures in patients with brain cancer) would probably have low proportions of 
prior consultations.
•  
Emergency presenters with ‘harder-to-suspect’ cancers (for example, multiple myeloma) would probably 
have consulted multiple times. 
Additionally, it was hypothesised that emergency presenters with leukaemia (where emergency 
presentations may result from abnormal findings in full blood count tests carried out in primary care), who 
were prior consultees, would probably not have consulted multiple times.
British Journal of General Practice, June 2017  e378
 groups. Deprivation groups were defined 
using quintiles of the English Index of 
Multiple Deprivation 2007 score based on 
patients’ postcodes.
Sample derivation. Of an initial total 
of 67 713 responders, diagnostic route 
information was available for 56 363 (83%). 
For practical reasons, analyses were 
restricted to emergency presenters with one 
of the 18 most common cancers. The final 
analysis sample included 4647 emergency 
presenters with complete information for all 
covariates (Appendix 2).
Analysis. Prior hypotheses regarding 
variation in both outcomes are shown in 
Box 1. Logistic regression models were 
used to estimate crude and adjusted odds 
ratios (ORs). The adjusted models included 
cancer site and sociodemographic variables.
The survey sample is drawn from patients 
with cancer with recent hospital treatment 
rather than incident cases. Variations in 
treatment modality by cancer site distort 
the sample’s composition compared with 
incident cases.16 Further sample distortions 
occur because of post-sampling mortality 
and survey non-response.5 Therefore,

 there are likely compositional differences 
between the analysis sample and the 
population of prior interest (incident 
emergency presenters). To account for 
this, when estimating overall percentages 
post-stratification weights were produced, 
derived using the complete (as opposed 
to linked) ‘Routes-to-diagnosis’ 2006–2010 
dataset from a previous study (Appendix 3).4
As all variables used in the derivation 
of weights were included in the adjusted 
models, weighting was not used in the 
regression analysis. Assuming the models 
are correctly specified, estimated OR should 
be unbiased and standard errors would be 
smaller than if weights had been included. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the regression 
analysis was repeated including weights.
RESULTS
The characteristics of the 4647 emergency 
presenters included in the analysis are 
shown in Table 1. Older and more deprived 
emergency 
presenters 
were 
under-
represented in the analysis sample, with 
only small differences by sex. Patients with 
haematological cancers (multiple myeloma, 
Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 
and leukaemia) were over-represented 
and those with lung and pancreatic cancer 
under-represented (Appendix 3).
Outcome 1: emergency presentation 
without prior consultations
Among the 4647 emergency presenters, 
1349 (29%) reported no prior consultation 
with a GP (Table 1). Using post-stratification 
weights (to account for distortions caused 
by sampling, non-response, and post-
sampling mortality), 34% of all emergency 
presenters with the studied cancers 
reported no previous consultations.
Emergency presenters who were male 
(32% versus 25% female), older (44% in 
≥85-year-olds versus 30% in 65–74-year-
olds), and belonged to the more deprived 
groups (35% versus 25% least deprived) were 
more likely to report no prior consultations, 
with little variation by ethnic group. 
Multivariable logistic regression indicated 
concordant findings (Table 1, Figure 1).
The proportion of emergency presenters 
without prior consultation varied greatly 
by cancer site, as indicated by sevenfold 
difference in adjusted odds (P<0.001). 
Specifically, 
emergency 
presenters 
with brain, renal, endometrial, or breast 
cancer were most likely to report no prior 
consultations (adjusted OR of 2.08, 1.71, 1.54, 
and 1.42, respectively, using colon cancer as 
reference); while those with mesothelioma, 
Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian, or pancreatic 
cancer were least likely (adjusted OR of 0.30, 
0.35, 0.41, and 0.45, respectively, Table 1, 
Figure 2). 
Outcome 2: three or more previous 
consultations (among emergency 
presenters with at least one consultation)
Among the 3298 emergency presenters with 
at least one prior consultation, 1356 (41%) 
had three or more consultations (Table 2). 
Using post-stratification weights, 35% of all 
emergency presenters who report that they 
have consulted previously with a GP would 
have done so three or more times. This is 
equivalent to 23% (weighted percentage) of

 all emergency presenters (independently of 
prior consultation status).
Three or more consultations were more 
common in females (45% versus 38% in 
males), younger patients (48% in 16–24-year-
olds versus 39% in 65–74-year- olds), and 
ethnic minority patients (52% versus 41% 
for white patients), with little variation by 
deprivation group. Multivariable logistic 
regression provided concordant findings 
(Table 2, Figure 3).
There was large variation by cancer, as 
indicated by fourfold variation in adjusted 
odds (P<0.001), with three or more 
consultations being most likely in emergency 
presenters with multiple myeloma (OR 1.81) 
and least likely in those with leukaemia (OR

 considerably, 
these 
changes 
were 
small relative to the width of associated 
confidence intervals. This highlights that 
the exact ordering of cancers should not 
be over-interpreted, rather taken as a 
broad indication of its position. As expected, 
weighting increased the standard errors, 
resulting in some of the smaller variations 
no longer being significant.
DISCUSSION
Summary
About one-third of emergency presenters 
reported no prior consultation with a GP
. 
Older and more deprived patients, and those 
with brain cancer, were more likely not to 
have consulted previously. Of those who had 
previously seen a GP, younger and ethnic 
minority patients, and those subsequently 
diagnosed with ‘harder-to-suspect’ cancers 
were more likely to have consulted multiple 
times.
Strengths and limitations
Patient reports of consultation history were 
used, which directly relate to perceptions of 
their own healthcare experience and have 
high face validity. Patients might overestimate 
pre-referral consultations compared with 
information in medical records, but recall 
inaccuracies would likely introduce random 
error and could not explain the large observed 
variations.17,18 Many different cancer sites 
were examined, enabling stronger inferences 
to be made on disease factors contributing to 
emergency presentations.
The 
sample 
included 
emergency 
presenters with recent hospital treatment, 
not all emergency presenters among 
incident cases; however, the weighting 
of overall proportions took into account 
compositional differences between the 
two populations.14 Weighting assumed that 
emergency presenters who died early or 
did not respond were ‘missing at random’ 
conditional on their age, sex, deprivation, 
and cancer site. This assumption may not 
be true, as emergency presenters in the 
sample may have different consultation 
patterns than otherwise similar (in terms 
of age, sex, deprivation, and cancer site) 
emergency presenters among incident 
cases. The potential for such bias is limited, 
however, as only 6% of all patients died 
between treatment and survey mail out, and 
the survey had a relatively high response 
rate (67%).14 Previous related research 
has shown the effect of sociodemographic 
factors varying by cancer site, but power 
considerations meant that such interactions 
could not be considered in this study.4,15 
While the present findings indicate that 
two-thirds of emergency presenters had at 
least one prior primary care consultation, 
previous analysis indicates that GPs are 
directly involved (that is, through direct 
emergency referral to hospital services) in 
one-third of all emergency presentations.11 
Assuming that emergency presenters who 
were referred to hospital as emergencies by 
their GP would consider such involvement 
to be a prior consultation, the combined 
interpretation of these figures would indicate 
that at least one-third of all emergency 
presenters have had prior contact with GPs 
but were not referred as emergencies. With 
the present data, it is impossible to establish

the proportion of emergency presentations 
generated by direct emergency GP referrals.
Comparison with existing literature
Prior evidence indicates that few emergency 
presenters had no prior primary care 
consultations, but is restricted to only three 
cancers (ovarian, lung, and colorectal) and 
dominated by medical record studies not 
examining whether the consultations were 
on relevant symptoms, and whether they 
were single or multiple.2,19–24
Males, older patients, and the most 
deprived emergency presenters were 
more likely to report no prior consultations, 
possibly reflecting a higher concentration of 
practical, cognitive, or emotional barriers to 
presentation in these patient groups.25–28 It 
has been further suggested that dementia 
syndromes may be implicated in emergency 
presentation in some older patients.29 
Some deprived patients may prefer using 
emergency services for regular care, which 
may also partly explain the findings.30
It has long been hypothesised that 
patients with brain cancer have a relatively 
high proportion of emergency presentations 
(>60%) because they often first present 
with seizures, without prodromal non-acute 
symptoms. The present findings support 
this hypothesis, which remains otherwise 
poorly studied.
It is important to note that the number of 
pre-referral consultations before a cancer 
diagnosis cannot be assumed to be a 
measure of diagnostic quality per se for 
individual patients. In some patients multiple 
consultations may represent appropriate 
care, including, for example, if there is a 
patient preference for non-referral during 
earlier consultations, or because of the need 
to review results of investigations ordered. 
However, in some patients (particularly when 
an emergency presentation has ensued), 
multiple consultations may represent 
potential for missed diagnostic opportunities. 
Where such judgements are possible, they 
can only be made after thorough case 
note review and the consideration of the 
presenting symptoms.31
Implications for research and policy
Contrary to suggestions that emergency 
presentations 
represent 
‘failures 
of 
primary care’, the present findings 
suggest that many emergency presenters 
have no prior contact with primary care 
and emphasise the potential influence of 
psychosocial patient factors.32 The fact that 
males, older patients, and more deprived 
emergency presenters are more likely not 
to have consulted provides opportunities for 
targeting of general public health education 
interventions about cancer symptoms.24 
One-quarter of all emergency presenters 
have three or more prior GP consultations. As 
hypothesised, among emergency presenters 
with at least one prior consultation, those with 
‘harder-to-suspect’ cancers (such as multiple 
myeloma and lung cancer) or characteristics 
associated with greater diagnostic difficulty 
(for example young age) were more likely to 
have had multiple consultations.15 In these 
patients, emergency presentations seem to 
reflect the challenges of suspecting cancer 
when symptoms are vague, and/or the 
baseline risk of cancer is low.
Among emergency presenters with 
breast and endometrial cancer (who had 
consulted previously), 21% and 33% had 
three or more consultations, respectively. 
These proportions are appreciably higher 
compared with those observed in a typical 
female with either cancer (7% and 17%, 
respectively).15 This suggests that emergency 
presenters with ‘easy-to-suspect’ cancers 
(such as breast and endometrial cancer) 
may tend to have atypical symptomatic 
presentations.
Consistent with the study hypotheses, 
patients with leukaemia had the lowest odds 
of three or more consultations among prior 
consultee emergency presenters, possibly 
reflecting direct emergency referrals by GPs 
after abnormal full blood count tests.
Generally, 
interventions 
aimed 
at 
improving diagnostic timeliness after 
presentation may also reduce emergency 
presentations.33 Such interventions may 
include greater use of clinical decision-
support tools, development of point-of-
care tests, and accelerated diagnostic care 
pathways to specialist assessment and 
imaging or endoscopic investigations.34,35
In conclusion, against suggestions that 
emergency presentations represent missed 
diagnoses, about one-third of emergency 
presenters have no prior GP consultations, 
and only about one-third experience multiple 
consultations. Both disease (for example 
cancer site and symptom signature) and 
patient factors (for example, lower levels 
of symptom awareness in older and more 
deprived patients) are likely to be implicated 
in emergency presentations without prior 
consultation. The findings can guide future 
research and policies, focusing on public 
health education campaigns (for example, 
aimed at changing patient awareness, 
beliefs and behaviour, particularly in higher 
risk groups), or healthcare (diagnostic 
safety) interventions, variably targeting 
different patient groups and symptomatic 
presentations.

Appendix 1. Linkage method used to assign emergency presentation 
status
Linkage was carried out previously by the Public Health England National Cancer Intelligence Network to 
support public reporting of data on cancer patient experience.a Records of English Cancer Patient Experience 
Survey (CPES) 2010 responders were matched using NHS number to the National Cancer Data Repository 
(NCDR) 2010 table. Of the 67 713 responders to CPES, 64 815 (95.7%) were matched to 82 788 tumours in the 
NCDR dataset, with some patients being matched to multiple tumours. A total of 2898 (4.3%) could not be 
matched to a tumour in the NCDR dataset. Among matched cases, linkage validity was checked using date 
of birth and found to be perfect in most cases, with plausible partial matches in nearly all of the non-perfectly 
matched cases. ‘Routes to Diagnosis’ codes were assigned using the most recent tumour in the NCDR dataset 
with a diagnostic route code. No diagnostic route was available for 8452 of CPES responders matched to the 
NCDR dataset, leaving 56 363 CPES records (83.2% of all CPES records). A substantial proportion of unlinked 
cases relate to diagnoses outside of the period covered by the ‘Routes to Diagnosis’ source (2006–2010), with 
43% of unlinked responders indicating that their cancer was diagnosed >5 years ago.

The stratification weights are standardised so that values >1 mean the emergency presentation of a type of cancer is under-represented in the English Cancer Patient Experience 
Survey (CPES) (and vice versa for values <1). These weights can be conceptualised as indicating the number of incident patients with cancer who present as emergencies in the 
population represented by each emergency presenter in the analysis sample. aThese are the CPES 2010 responders who were diagnosed through emergency presentation. bThe 
weights are calculated as follows:
1.  
The number was counted of CPES responders flagged as emergency presenters in the linked Routes to Diagnosis (RTD) 2006–2010 dataset for each cancer by sex, by age group, 
by deprivation strata (a total of 1440 strata).
2.  
The number was counted of emergency presenters in the population-based RTD dataset for each cancer by sex, by age group, by deprivation strata (a total of 1440 strata).
3.  
Where the number was zero in CPES but not in RTD, strata were merged across all deprivation groups (of responders with the same cancer diagnosis, sex, and age group).
4.  
After merging on deprivation there were still 46 cancer by sex by age strata with zero count in CPES and non-zero count in RTD. These strata were merged such that a stratum 
containing zero count in CPES was merged with the stratum of the most populous adjacent age group (of responders with the same sex and cancer diagnosis).
5.  
The weights for each of the 786 final strata were calculated by dividing the number of cases in the RTD dataset by the number of responders. The resulting weights were applied 
to each responder in the strata.
6.  
The weights were then normalised such that the mean weight among the analysis sample was = 1.

Spearman correlation coefficients for OR for cancer diagnosis between weighted and unweighted = 0.79 for ‘no prior consultation’ and = 0.83 for three or more prior GP 
consultations. Note: The primary interest is in comparing point estimates obtained from the main and the sensitivity analysis, rather than CI and P-values, as by nature the 
use of weights increases standard errors.
