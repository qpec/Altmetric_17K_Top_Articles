BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Scientific understanding of the forces involved in the decades-
long decline of adolescent alcohol use in the United States is limited. This study examines 
specific changes in US adolescent frequent binge drinking (FBD) by age (variation due to 
maturation), period (variation across time that does not covary across age), and cohort 
(variation common to adolescents born around the same time).
METHODS: We analyzed nationally representative, multicohort data from 8th, 10th, and 12th 
grade students sampled between 1991 and 2015 from Monitoring the Future (n = 1 065 022) 
to estimate age, period, and cohort effects on adolescents’ FBD (defined as ≥2 occasions of 
≥5 drinks in a row during the past 2 weeks). Age-Period-Cohort analyses were stratified 
by sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Trends in the associations between 
demographics and FBD across historical time were examined.
RESULTS: Decreases in FBD during adolescence were attributable to period and cohort effects 
independent of age variations. Birth cohorts between 1985 and 1990 showed the greatest 
decline in FBD. The Age-Period-Cohort results were consistent across sex, race/ethnicity, 
and SES, with the exception of slower declines seen among African American adolescents 
compared with white adolescents since 2007. We also found convergence in FBD by sex and 
divergence by SES.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent declines in adolescent FBD have been driven by period and cohort 
effects. Attention is warranted for the slower declines in FBD seen among African American 
adolescents since 2007, a narrowing difference by sex, and a growing gap by SES.

WhAT’S KNOWN ON ThIS SUbjECT: Alcohol use 
in adolescence is related to various adverse 
consequences. Adolescent alcohol use has declined 
since the 1990s in the United States, although no 
systematic analysis of age, period, and cohort 
effects on frequent binge drinking has previously 
been conducted.
WhAT ThIS STUDy ADDS: Age, period, and cohort 
effects have driven decreases in adolescent 
frequent binge drinking. Similar patterns were 
observed across demographics, but African 
American adolescents have experienced slower 
declines since 2007. Sex convergence and 
socioeconomic status divergence were found across 
historical time.

Greater alcohol use during 
adolescence is associated with 
increased likelihood of adverse 
correlates, including lower  
academic achievement, 
1 risky sexual 
behaviors, 
2, 
 
3 psychiatric problems,

and development of alcohol use 
disorder.6 
– 
8 Efforts have been 
made to reduce adolescent alcohol 
involvement, 
9 and overall declines 
have been observed in the United 
States since the 1990s.10 However, 
our understanding of the forces 
that may drive the historical change 
in adolescent drinking is limited. 
Existing literature on trends in 
alcohol use among adolescents has 
focused on binge drinking, defined 
as ≥5 drinks in a row.11, 
 
12 The 
number of days involved in binge 
drinking tends to increase by age 
during adolescence.13 Such patterns 
of frequent binge drinking (FBD) 
deserve our attention because the 
number of heavy drinking days is 
related to injury and other health 
consequences.14

Trends over time in alcohol use are 
sometimes examined in terms of age, 
period, and cohort effects. Age effects 
refer to variation over time that is 
attributable to maturation, with  
older adolescents, for instance, more 
likely to engage in heavy drinking 
than younger adolescents.10, 
 
18  
Independent of those age patterns, 
period effects refer to increases and 
decreases in the population mean 
level of drinking that are common 
across all adolescents and that may 
be attributable to policy or other 
social change that is ubiquitous in 
effect. Cohort effects, then, refer to 
variation over time that is common 
to groups of adolescents born 
around the same time and coming 
of age together through historical 
time. Among adults, both cohort and 
period effects describe long-term 
patterns of alcohol consumption19 
–21; 
for example, binge drinking is 
less prevalent for those born in 
the 1980s22 (cohort effect), and 
alcohol consumption among those 
of legal drinking age is influenced by 
changes in alcohol policy23 (period 
effect). However, little attention has 
been paid specifically to trends in 
adolescent drinking despite their 
importance as predictors of the risk 
of alcohol abuse and dependence in 
adulthood.6 
–8, 
 
24
By using Age-Period-Cohort (APC) 
analysis, the current study examined 
age, period, and cohort effects on 
changes in adolescent drinking 
trends, with a particular focus on 
FBD, defined as ≥2 occasions of ≥5 
drinks in a row in the past 2 weeks.25 
Consuming ≥5 drinks is typically 
referred to as binge drinking or 
heavy episodic drinking; trends in 
frequent consumption (averaging 
once per week) of ≥5 drinks has not 
been thoroughly explored to date. 
Due to potential variation in  
alcohol use across demographic 
subgroups, 
11, 
 
26, 
 
27 separate analyses 
were conducted by sex, race/
ethnicity, and socioeconomic status 
(SES). Specific research questions 
included: (1) What are the age, 
period, and cohort effects on FBD 
trends among US adolescents? (2) 
Are there differences in the age, 
period, and cohort effects across 
demographic subgroups? and (3) 
How do associations between 
demographic subgroups and FBD 
change over historical time?
METhODS
Sample
Monitoring the Future has conducted 
nationally representative cross-
sectional surveys of 8th-, 10th-, and 
12th-grade students annually since 
1991, with ∼45 000 adolescents 
included per year.10 Approximately 
420 public and private schools are 
sampled each year in a multistage, 
random sampling design with 
replacement, with a maximum of 
350 students from each school; 
schools typically participate for 2 
years. Student response rates on 
self-administered questionnaires 
range from 79% to 91%. Almost all 
nonresponse is due to absenteeism; 
∼1% of students refuse to 
participate. A detailed description of 
design and procedures is provided 
elsewhere.10
The current study includes all 
adolescents who provided valid 
responses for alcohol-use items from 
1991 through 2015 (92.3% of the 
total sample). Due to low numbers 
of cases, adolescents <13 years and 
>19 years of age were excluded 
(1.8%), as were those who did not 
provide their age (2.0%). The final 
analytic sample included 1 065 022 
adolescents (379 992 in 8th grade, 
360 961 in 10th grade, and 324 069 
in 12th grade).
Measures
Alcohol Use
Our primary analysis examined past 
2-week binge drinking (ie, ≥5 drinks 
in a row). The survey queried, “Think 
back over the last 2 weeks. How 
many times have you had ≥5 drinks 
in a row? (A ‘drink’ is a bottle of  
beer, a glass of wine, a wine cooler, 
a shot glass of liquor, or a mixed 
drink).” FBD was defined as ≥2 
occasions of binge drinking in the 
past 2 weeks (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
Sensitivity analyses were conducted 
to test the usefulness of our 
definition of FBD; we varied the 
definition of FBD as (1) ≥1 occasions, 
and (2) ≥6 occasions in the past 2 
weeks. Furthermore, supplemental 
analyses were conducted to examine 
changes in occasional/heavy drinking 
(1 = drinking in the past 30 days and 
up to 1 occasion of binge drinking in 
the past 2 weeks; 0 = no drinking in 
the past 30 days). A survey question 
“On how many occasions have you 
had alcoholic beverages to drink 
during the last 30 days?” was used in 
combination with the binge drinking 
question.
Demographics
APC models were stratified by 
several demographic covariates. Race 
2

 PEDIATRICS Volume 139, number 6, June 2017
and ethnicity were self-reported 
by respondents who were allowed 
to select multiple categories. We 
categorized respondents into: white, 
African American, Hispanic, and 
other race/ethnicity. Those who 
reported >1 category were included 
in the other race/ethnicity category. 
SES was operationalized as parental 
education based on the highest level 
achieved by either parent: some 
college or more compared with 
high school or less. Analyses were 
also stratified by respondent self-
identified sex (boy or girl).
Statistical Analysis
APC models were estimated by using 
the Clayton and Schiffler approach.28, 
 
29 
This approach iteratively estimates 
models incorporating age, period, 
and cohort effects; the best-fitting 
model is selected based on model 
fit statistics (by using likelihood-
based deviance along with degrees of 
freedom). The approach is iterative 
because the simultaneous linear 
effects of age, period, and cohort 
cannot be directly estimated (due 
to a linear dependence across the 3 
variables). The Clayton and Schiffler 
approach first includes a linear 
effect of age and then the sum of 
period and cohort effects (ie, drift), 
which only identifies the extent to 
which trends over time increase or 
decrease. Period and cohort effects 
are then estimated as nonlinear 
deviations around the total linear 
change. We chose the year 1986 as 
the reference birth cohort because 
it was in the midpoint of the cohort 
distributions, and we chose 2007 as 
the reference period because it was 
a changing point in the overall rate 
of alcohol use. The APC modeling 
was conducted by using “apc.fit” in 
the “Epi” package in the R software 
(www. 
r- 
project. 
org/ 
).
In addition to estimating APC 
models, we examined the association 
between demographics and FBD 
in 3 historical time periods (1991 
to 1998, 1999 to 2006, and 2007 
to 2015) using logistic regression 
models stratified by the time periods.
RESULTS
 
Figure 1 shows the percent of 
adolescents engaging in FBD by age 
and 3 different period categories: 
1991 to 1998, 1999 to 2006, and 
2007 to 2015. FBD increased by 
age during adolescence in all time 
periods. The patterns were similar 
between 1991 to 1998 and 1999 to 
2006 but decreases were observed 
from 2007 to 2015 for all age groups. 
However, Fig 1 does not provide 
an assessment of potential cohort 
effects and how cohort effects may 
be distinct from the overall secular 
trends captured in period effects.
APC Analyses of FbD
The inclusion of age, period, and 
cohort effects produced the best 
model fit for trends over time in FBD 
(n = 116 129) versus other drinking 
(any drinkers and nondrinkers, n = 
948 893) (Supplemental Table 2). 
FBD increased with age (age effects 
in Fig 2); <5% of adolescents aged 13 
to 14 years reported FBD, whereas 
∼20% of adolescents 18 years of age 
did. Regarding period effects (Fig 2),  
FBD has declined since 1990; the 
risk of adolescent FBD in 2015 
was ∼0.9 times the risk during the 
reference period, 2007. Birth cohorts 
born around 1990 (ie, 8th graders 
in 2003 to 2004, 10th graders in 
2005 to 2006, and 12th graders in 
2007 to 2008) had a lower risk of 
FBD compared with those born in 
the earlier and later cohorts (cohort 
effects in Fig 2), independent of 
age-related trends and the overall 
decrease in risk across the period.
APC Analyses by Demographics
APC analyses for FBD by sex indicate 
that the best-fitting models include 
age, period, and cohort effects 
separately for both boys and girls 
(Fig 3, Supplemental Table 2). APC 
results were consistent across 
race/ethnicity, with an exception 
of nonsignificant age, period, 
and cohorteffects for Hispanic 
adolescents (Fig 4, Supplemental 
Table 3). Similarly, APC analyses 
were generalizable across SES (Fig 5, 
Supplemental Table 4).
Demographic Moderators of Alcohol 
Use Across Time
We divided the data into 3 time 
periods to estimate trends in 
the association of demographics

with FBD (Table 1). Tests of 
interaction with time periods 
indicated substantial variation in 
FBD by sex. Girls were less likely 
than boys to report FBD, but the 
effects were weakened (odds ratio 
[OR] from 0.58 in 1991 to 1998 to 
0.71 in 2007 to 2015), showing a 
converging trend by sex (P < .0001 
for interactions). Although no 
significant variations were found by 
race/ethnicity across time periods, 
African American students were 
less likely than white students 
to report FBD where the effects 
were weakened (OR from 0.42 in 
1991 to 1998 and 1999 to 2006 to 
0.53 in 2007 to 2015), suggesting 
a convergence (P < .0001 for 
interactions between the 1999–
2006 and 2007–2015 cohorts, and 
the 1991–1998 and 2007–2015 
cohorts). Higher SES adolescents 
were less likely to report FBD 
compared with those from 
lower SES, and the effects were 
strengthened (OR from 0.83 in 1991 
to 1998 to 0.79 in 2007 to 2015), 
suggesting a growing difference  
(P < .0001 for the comparison 
between the 1991–1998 and  
2007–2015 cohorts).
Sensitivity Analysis
To examine the robustness of our 
results, we repeated the analyses 
with 2 alternative cut points, 1 with a 
lower level of frequency (≥1 or more 
binges in the last 2 weeks), and 1 
with a higher level of frequency (≥6 
binges in the last 2 weeks). Both of 
these cut points produced consistent 
APC results (Supplemental Fig 6, 
 
Supplemental Table 5). A converging 
gap by sex and growing disparity by 
SES in recent cohorts (2007 to 2015) 
were also found (Supplemental  
Table 6).
Supplemental Analysis
APC supplemental analyses on 
occasional/heavy drinking (ie, any 
drinking in the past 30 days and 
up to 1 occasion of binge drinking 
in the past 2 weeks, n = 238 202) 
compared with no drinking (n = 
710 691) revealed that the best-
fitting model included age, period 
and cohort effects (Supplemental 
Table 7). As illustrated in 
Supplemental Fig 7, occasional/
heavy drinking increased with 
age, and those born around 
1990 had the highest decline of 
occasional/heavy drinking versus 
no drinking compared with those 
in the preceding and subsequent 
birth cohorts. Positive period 
effects have been observed since 
2007; the decline in occasional/
heavy drinking has been slower 
after 2007. Girls were more likely 
than boys to engage in occasional/
heavy drinking, whereas higher 
SES adolescents were less likely 
to be involved in occasional/
heavy drinking (Supplemental 
Table 8). In general, adolescent 
occasional/heavy drinking patterns 
were similar to FBD, with the 
exception of the slower declines 
in occasional/heavy drinking after 
2007 and the greater probability 
of girls than boys being involved in 
occasional/heavy drinking.

proportion in 1986. The period estimates are 
compared with a referent period of 2007, 
and thus the lines can be interpreted as the 
average proportion of US students’ FBD in that 
year, regardless of cohort, compared with the 
average proportion in 2007.

DISCUSSION
Using nationally representative 
multicohort data from a large 
sample of adolescents, the current 
study systematically examines age, 
period, and cohort effects on FBD 
in the United States. First, we found 
that FBD decreased in recent years 
among all ages during adolescence, 
which is consistent with previous 
research on declines in adolescent 
alcohol use.10 The trends were best 
described by effects attributable to 
period and cohort in addition to age-
related variation. In other words, 
decreases in adolescent FBD across 
the past 25 years were driven by 
factors influencing all age groups 
simultaneously as well as influences 
on particular birth cohorts. Since 
1991, the risk of FBD has decreased 
among adolescents independently of 
age and birth cohorts. Furthermore, 
those born around 1990 had the 
highest decline of FBD compared 
with those in the preceding and 
subsequent cohorts of adolescents.

Factors underlying these effects may 
include increased public efforts to 
reduce the risk of underage drinking 
in the United States9, 
 
30 (eg, National 
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism Intervention Guide for 
Practitioners, 201531), and increased 
levels of disapproval of heavy 
alcohol use among recent cohorts of 
adolescents.10 Furthermore, online 
social networking32 may affect 
drinking patterns among recent 
cohort adolescents because most 
young people report drinking for 
social motives.33 As some research 
has suggested, 
11 however, declines in 
alcohol use may also be attributable 
to an increase in preference for 
other drugs (eg, nonmedical use of 
prescription medication), although 
more rigorous investigation is 
necessary to understand the 
mechanisms.
Overall, APC results were consistent 
across diverse demographic groups 
with a few notable differences. 
Boys and higher SES adolescents 
experienced rapid increases in FBD 
by age compared with girls and lower 
SES adolescents, respectively. African 
American adolescents showed the 
lowest rates of FBD among all racial 
groups across all ages, consistent 
with previous research on their 
delayed onset and lower prevalence 
of heavy drinking.34, 
 
35 Furthermore, 
although period effects have led 
to decreases for all racial groups, 
the decline in FBD among African 
American adolescents has been 
slower than among white adolescents 
since 2007. The recent declines in 
FBD among adolescents suggest 
that the economic recession in the 
late 2000s, when a population-level 
increase in the prevalence of FBD 
was observed in the United States, 
36 
may have had less of an effect on the 
drinking patterns of adolescents. This 
finding is consistent with previous 
research showing a weak association 
between state-level economy and 
any alcohol use among adolescents.37 
The slower decrease among African 
American adolescents, however, may 
indicate variations in that link.
Regarding the trends in the 
association between demographics 
and drinking over historical time, 
the analyses revealed substantial 
convergence in FBD by sex in more 
recent time periods. The convergence 
resulted from greater declines in 
boys’ FBD than in girls’ FBD among 
recent cohorts of adolescents, as 
shown in the cohort effects from 
APC analyses. In fact, this finding is 
consistent with growing evidence 
of a convergence in the sex gap for 
alcohol initiation and progression to 
alcohol problems both in the United 
States and elsewhere.10, 
 
38 
–41  
Furthermore, trends in other risk 
behaviors are increasing faster 
among adolescent girls in the United 
States than among boys, including 
preference for risky activities.42 
Changes in sex roles43 and a shift in 
the targeting of alcohol marketing 
to young female consumers44 may 
have contributed to this narrowing 
sex gap. Although the causes are 
speculative, we provide evidence of 
greater declines in FBD among boys 
than girls born in recent cohorts.
The analyses also found growing 
discrepancy by SES in FBD among 
adolescents in the United States. That 
is, higher SES adolescents were less 
likely than those from a lower SES to 
engage in FBD, and the strength of 
the association is growing in more 
recent time periods. These findings

are in contrast to some previous 
research on the positive association 
between binge drinking and SES.45 
The FBD group in the current study 
includes those who engage in binge 
drinking ≥2 times in the past 2 
weeks, whereas previous research 
referred to any binge episode.46, 
 
47 
Other research48 has found mixed 
results by grade in the association 
between SES and drinking, in which 
the prevalence of binge drinking 
is higher for 8th and 10th graders 
from lower SES despite the opposite 
association for 12th graders. A 
study of high-intensity drinking of 
≥15 drinks in a row found a higher 
incidence among lower SES 12th 
graders.49 Our findings add evidence 
that lower SES students may be at 
greater risk of problematic drinking.49 
More detailed research is needed to 
understand the SES effect and risky 
drinking among adolescents.
Regarding race and ethnicity, we 
found a convergence between African 
American and white adolescents, 
especially in recent years, despite 
the fact that African American 
adolescents typically show unique 
drinking patterns (eg, delayed  
onset of heavy drinking34, 
 
35).  
This finding may again point to the 
slower declines in heavy drinking 
among African American adolescents, 
although future research is needed 
to understand the changing 
mechanisms of this convergence.
Despite the declines in FBD, 
supplemental analyses reveal that 
the decrease in occasional/heavy 
drinking among adolescents has been 
slower in recent years, regardless 
of their age and birth cohorts. 
The occasional/heavy drinking 
group is, however, substantially 
heterogeneous, including those who 
have had only 1 drink in the last 30 
days and those who have engaged 
in binge drinking once in the last 
2 weeks. Additional research is 
warranted for those who drink to a 
lesser degree.
The current study has several 
limitations. First, alcohol use may 
vary within categories of use (eg, 
beverage types21, 
 
33, 
 
48). Second, 
the Monitoring the Future data do 
not include those who drop out of 
secondary schools; however, this 
concern is somewhat alleviated 
because dropout rates have been 
declining in the United States.50 
Third, APC models do not explicate 
the mechanisms underlying APC 
effects.
CONCLUSIONS
Declines in FBD among adolescents 
are attributable to age, period, 
and cohort effects, with variations 
by demographics. These declines 
likely reflect successful intervention 
attempts to reduce alcohol use 
among adolescents. However, 
practitioners should take note 
that these effects have not been 
equal across demographic groups, 
particularly with regard to slower 
declines among African American 
adolescents (compared with white 
adolescents). Screening for alcohol 
use and FBD in particular remains 
important. The narrowing difference 
by sex but the growing gap by SES 
also deserve close attention by 
researchers and practitioners.
