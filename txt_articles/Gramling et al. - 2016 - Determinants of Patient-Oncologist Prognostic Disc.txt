IMPORTANCE Patients with advanced cancer often report expectations for survival that differ
from their oncologists’expectations. Whether patients know that their survival expectations
differ from those of their oncologists remains unknown. This distinction is important because
knowingly expressing differences of opinion is important for shared decision making,
whereas patients not knowing that their understanding differs from that of their treating
physician is a potential marker of inadequate communication.
OBJECTIVE To describe the prevalence, distribution, and proportion of prognostic
discordance that is due to patients’knowingly vs unknowingly expressing an opinion that
differs from that of their oncologist.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional study conducted at academic and
community oncology practices in Rochester, New York, and Sacramento, California. The
sample comprises 236 patients with advanced cancer and their 38 oncologists who
participated in a randomized trial of an intervention to improve clinical communication.
Participants were enrolled from August 2012 to June 2014 and followed up until
October 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We ascertained discordance by comparing patient and
oncologist ratings of 2-year survival probability. For discordant pairs, we determined whether
patients knew that their opinions differed from those of their oncologists by asking the
patients to report how they believed their oncologists rated their 2-year survival.
RESULTS Among the 236 patients (mean [SD] age, 64.5 [11.4] years; 54% female),
161 patient-oncologist survival prognosis ratings (68%; 95% CI, 62%-75%) were discordant.
Discordance was substantially more common among nonwhite patients compared with white
patients (95% [95% CI, 86%-100%] vs 65% [95% CI, 58%-73%], respectively; P = .03).
Among 161 discordant patients, 144 (89%) did not know that their opinions differed from that
of their oncologists and nearly all of them (155 of 161 [96%]) were more optimistic than their
oncologists.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, patient-oncologist discordance about survival
prognosis was common and patients rarely knew that their opinions differed from those of
their oncologists.

onoring patients’wishes for medical interventions
near the end of life requires high-quality communi-
cation as death approaches and treatment tradeoffs
evolve.1,2 For patients who wish to be involved in their treat-
ment decisions, communicating effectively about survival
prognosis is crucial.3,4 Indeed, the investigators of
the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for
Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) concluded
that “the most fundamental medical choice patients with
incurable cancer face—the decision between life-extending
therapy and comfort care—may be highly influenced by their
understanding of their prognoses.”5 However, multiple
research studies have observed that patients with advanced
cancer often rate their prognosis more optimistically than
their oncologists.5-9
In this study, we evaluate how often patient-oncologist
discordance occurs when patients know vs do not know that
their opinion about survival prognosis differs from the opin-
ion of their oncologist. Sometimes, patients might express
personal opinions about their prognosis that they expect to
differ from their oncologists’views and therefore knowingly
disagree with what they believe their oncologists think.
Other times, however, patients might express opinions
about their prognosis that they do not know differ from their
oncologists’views and therefore mistakenly believe that
they hold a shared understanding with their oncologists.
This distinction is crucial because known discordance is a
form of perspective taking that is expected in shared deci-
sion making, whereas unknown discordance is suggestive of
failed communication. Although both forms of discordance
are clinically important, their fundamental differences offer
opportunities for tailoring resources to support patients and
their oncologists in achieving high-quality treatment deci-
sions. For example, in conversations in which patients know
that their opinions are discordant from those held by their
oncologists, discussions might initially focus on information
sources, belief systems, and criteria for making prognosis-
and preference-sensitive decisions.10 In contrast, in conver-
sations in which patients and physicians do not know that
their perspectives differ, physicians might ask patients what
they wish to know, provide clear sensitive prognostic infor-
mation, check their patients’understanding, and only then
proceed to decision making.4
We also examine whether prognostic discordance, par-
ticularly unknown discordance, differs by patient race. Ra-
cial disparities in advanced cancer care are substantial, with
blackpatientsreceivinglower-qualitycommunicationandless
preference-concordant treatment at the end of life than white
patients.11-15 Previous work has found that black patients are
more likely than white patients to report discordantly opti-
mistic perceptions of their prognosis8,16 and that such beliefs
are associated with preferences for invasive, life-extending
treatments.5,17,18 High-quality communication reduces prog-
nosticdiscordanceandpromotespreference-concordanttreat-
ment in advanced cancer care.6,19 A better understanding of
prognostic discordance, as we offer herein, holds promise for
informing efforts to improve communication and reduce ra-
cial disparities in care for advanced cancer.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional analysis of 236 patients with ad-
vanced cancer and their 38 oncologists from practices in Roch-
ester, New York, and Sacramento, California, who partici-
pated in a randomized trial of a communication intervention
intheoutpatientoncologysetting.Allclinicianandpatientpar-
ticipants provided written informed consent. The University
of Rochester and University of California, Davis Research
Subjects Review Boards approved this study.
Context, Population, and Eligibility
The parent study occurred in academic and nonacademic hos-
pital-based and community-based outpatient oncology prac-
tices in Rochester, New York, and Sacramento, California. Par-
ticipants were enrolled from August 2012 to June 2014 and
followed up until October 2015. Patients were eligible to par-
ticipate if they were aged 21 years or older, were able to un-
derstand spoken English and provide consent, and had either
(a) stage IV nonhematologic cancer or (b) stage III cancer and
whose oncologist “would not be surprised” if the patient were
to die within 12 months. We excluded hospitalized patients be-
cause the parent trial required the ability to participate in a
coaching intervention and outpatient visits with the primary
oncologist. Patients already enrolled in hospice were ineli-
gible because this was among the study outcomes. All oncolo-
gists at study practices were eligible to participate if they cared
for patients with nonhematologic tumors. Two hundred sixty-
five patients enrolled in the parent trial. For this analysis, we
excluded 29 patients for whom we could not evaluate discor-
dance because they did not provide an estimate of their sur-
vival prognosis (n = 22) or did not complete any of the study
questionnaire (n = 7).

Key Points
Question When patients with advanced cancer report beliefs
about their survival prognosis that differ from the expectations of
their oncologists, how often do they know that their beliefs differ?
Findings In this cross-sectional analysis of 236 patients and
38 oncologists, 68% of patients held opinions about their survival
prognosis that differed from their oncologist and only 1 in 10
discordant patients knew that their opinions differed.
Meaning In this study, patient-oncologist discordance about
survival prognosis was common and usually due to patients’
inaccurate understanding of their oncologists’expectations.

the oncologist. The control condition was usual care. The main
outcome was quality of communication, coded from audio re-
cordings of the first postintervention outpatient oncologist-
patient visit (termed the index visit). Patients and physicians
completed interviewer-administered questionnaires at base-
line, following the first office visit (usually immediately, but
up to 1 week afterward in some cases), and quarterly thereaf-
ter. For these analyses, we used the patient and oncologist
postindex visit questionnaires to best align the timing of their
responses to prognosis expectations. We included all partici-
pants in this analysis because prognostic discordance did not
differ by study arm (68.7% for the intervention arm vs 67.7%
for the control arm; P = .87).
Measures
Prognostic Discordance
Patients and their oncologists independently reported their
survival expectations on the postindex visit questionnaire. Pa-
tients were asked, “What do you believe are the chances that
you will live for 2 years or more?” and their oncologists were
asked, “What do you believe are the chances that this patient
will live for 2 years or more?” We used the following response
options from the SUPPORT self-rated prognosis measure,5
modified to include 100% and 0% options: 100%, about 90%,
about 75%, about 50%/50%, about 25%, about 10%, and 0%.
We chose the 2-year time frame because the expected me-
dian survival for the study population was 12 to 16 months and
mostpatientswereunlikelytolivefor5years.Wedefinedprog-
nostic discordance as difference in more than 1 category
between patient and physician ratings.
Knowing vs Not Knowing
We were interested in determining whether patients
expectedthattheirprognosisopinionsdifferedfromthoseheld
by their oncologists. Therefore, we asked all patients the fol-
lowing: “What do you believe your doctor believes are the
chances that you will live for 2 years or more?” (same re-
sponse options). Patients who were correct about their on-
cologists’ratingsoroffbyonly1categoryweredefinedasknow-
ing their oncologists’opinions; the rest (including those who
selected “I don’
t know”) were defined as not knowing the on-
cologists’opinions. Using this distinction, we categorized all
patients whose self-rating of prognosis was discordant from
the rating by their oncologists as either knowingly discordant
or unknowingly discordant.
Independent Variables
We measured the following patient factors to evaluate the dis-
tribution of prognostic discordance: age, sex, race/ethnicity
(self-classified and asked for purposes of investigating poten-
tial disparities), educational status, income, aggressiveness
of cancer, self-efficacy with health care communication
(Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions scale21),
Preferred Locus of Decision-Making,22 recalled discussion of
prognosiswiththeironcologist,andend-of-lifetreatmentpref-
erences. Using information on cancer type and stage at study
baseline, 2 study oncologists assigned each participant as hav-
ing or not having a highly aggressive cancer. We evaluated
recalled prognosis discussion using the following: “To what
extent have you discussed your prognosis with your doctor?”
(completely, mostly, a little, or not at all). We measured end-
of-life treatment preferences by asking patients to select the
types of treatments they would want if their physician were
to inform them that there were “no further anticancer treat-
ments that would be helpful,” including “palliative care (eg,
comfort care, focus on quality of life but not a cure)” (defi-
nitely yes, possibly yes, unsure, possibly no, or definitely no).

cussionsusingthefollowing:“Towhatextenthaveyoudiscussed

Statistical Analysis
This is a descriptive study. As such, we evaluated the fre-
quencyanddistributionofallstudyvariables,includingpatient-
physician prognostic discordance. To account for the cluster-
ing of multiple patients within physicians, we used survey data
analysis procedures for clustered data to estimate 95% confi-
denceintervalsforprevalenceestimatesandtoperformχ2tests
of association (using the Wald log-linear χ2 method for survey
data). We then described the proportion of discordant pairs in-
volvingknowinglydiscordantandunknowinglydiscordantpa-
tients. For scale variables (eg, Perceived Efficacy in Patient-
Physician Interactions) or multicategory items (eg, Preferred
Locus of Decision-Making), we either used clinically relevant
thresholdsorcreatedlow,middle,andhighcategoriesbasedon
theobserveddistributionsofourdatatoexplorepotentialdose-
response relationships. We used χ2 tests for associations with
discordance frequency. We used mixed-effects multiple logis-
tic regression for evaluation of confounding, with random in-
tercepts for physicians, to account for clustering. We used both

tential confounding, using change in magnitude of association
as an indicator of confounding.
Results
Among 236 patients (mean [SD] age, 64.5 [11.4] years; 54%
female), 161 (68%; 95% CI, 62%-75%) rated their 2-year sur-
vival prognosis discordantly from their oncologists; 144 of the
161 patients (89%) did not know that their opinions differed
from the opinions of their oncologists. Among this unknow-
ingly discordant group, 29% (42 of 144) were aware that they
did not know their oncologists’opinions (ie, indicating “I don’
t
know” when asked about their oncologists’prognosis rat-
ings). Nearly all of the discordant dyads (155 of 161 [96%]) in-
volved patients who rated their prognosis more optimisti-
cally than their physicians.
As shown in the Table, the prevalence of prognostic
discordance did not differ substantively based on patients’in-

Discussion
This study evaluated patient-oncologist prognosis discor-
dance in a multisite sample of patients with advanced cancer.
As with other work, we observed a high prevalence of such
discordance in the setting of advanced cancer.5-9
Four of our observations add substantively to the exist-
ingscientificliterature.First,weobservedthatonlyasmallfrac-
tion of discordant dyads involved patients who knew that their
opinions differed from the opinions of their oncologists. The
vast majority of prognostic discordance happened among pa-
tients who either reported a mistaken understanding of their
oncologists’opinions or were unable to guess what their on-
cologist thought. Second, we observed that nearly all occur-
rences of discordance involved patients who wished to be ac-
tively engaged in treatment decision making. Third, 70% of
discordant pairs were among patients who preferred to have
increasing support for quality of life near the end of life—a
decision that would require understanding when death was
approaching.
Finally, we observed discordance more frequently among
nonwhite patients compared with white patients. This work
does not directly evaluate actual patient-oncologist commu-
nication. However, our findings identify that the most com-
mon form of patient-oncologist discordance in prognosis ex-
pectations involves patients being unknowingly discordant,
and we propose that this is a marker for inadequate commu-
nication. Therefore, our findings are consistent with previ-
ous literature documenting suboptimal communication be-
tween physicians (usually white) and nonwhite patients who
are seriously ill.11-15 A growing body of evidence suggests that
the quality of communication—including communication
about prognosis6,9,11-13,16—represents an important and
mutable source of disparity in end-of-life care.

This study has important limitations. First and foremost,
the data presented herein do not permit us to determine why
discordant patients do not know their oncologists’opinions
about prognosis or why this differs by race. However, other
work finds that communicating about prognosis in advanced
cancer is not merely a straightforward exchange of informa-
tion; it is affective24 and, when it happens, it occurs amid sub-
stantial uncertainty, confusion, and often terror. Related work
in palliative care settings—where prognostic discussions oc-
cur routinely25—observes that prognosis communication is a
complexandrelationalprocess26thatislinkedcloselywithcon-
versation about treatment goals and personal values.2,27 The
degree to which the observed high prevalence of unknowing
discordanceinthisstudyreflectspatientand/oroncologisthesi-
tancy (or other barriers) to engage in such conversation, dif-
ferentialinterpretationorpoorrecallofconversationsthathave
occurred,orself-reportphenomenathatdistorttruebeliefs(eg,
optimistic prognostic ratings for purposes of avoiding super-
stitions about predicting death) remains unclear. Second, our
sample of nonwhite participants is small and includes per-
sons from multiple racial groups. All but 1 of the 22 partici-
pants in this group exhibited prognostic discordance. Al-
though this provides compelling evidence of a strong
association, the exact magnitude is subject to some instabil-
ity. Therefore, we focus our main findings on directly ob-
served prevalence estimates and cluster-adjusted confi-
dence intervals. We limit our use of multivariate modeling to
evaluate potential confounding by a relatively small con-
founder set. Further work with larger nonwhite populations
is necessary for more precise estimates and more exploration
of interacting phenomena (ie, mediators and moderators).
Third, this study does not attempt to determine prognostic ac-
curacy. Indeed, prognostication is quite challenging and some
related work suggests that patients’perceptions of prognosis
might hold some independent prognostic value in advanced
cancer,28 further complicating what it means to be accurate.
Rather, we focus herein on the plausible decision-making im-
plications of holding differing prognostic perceptions. Fu-
ture research on prognostic discordance will need to help us
understand the conditions under which discordant percep-
tionsareadvantageousanddisadvantageoustowell-being,sur-
vival, and decision making.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that patient-oncologist prognostic discor-
dance is common in advanced cancer and that it is usually due
to patients not knowing their oncologists’prognosis opinions.
Weproposethatthisunknowinglydiscordantstatusisamarker,
at least on average, for inadequate patient-physician commu-
nication about a topic of high relevance to treatment decision
making in advanced cancer. Therefore, this study supports the
urgent clinical and societal need to better understand what it
means to communicate well about prognosis to achieve treat-
ment that honors patients’values, preferences, and wishes.
