Abstract
CYP24A1, the primary inactivating enzyme for vitamin D, is
often overexpressed in human cancers, potentially neutralizing the
antitumor effects of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D. How-
ever,itisunclearwhetherCYP24A1expressionservesasafunctional
contributor versus only a biomarker for tumor progression. In this
study, we investigated the role of CYP24A1 on malignant progres-
sion of a murine model of BrafV600E-induced papillary thyroid
cancer (PTC). Mice harboring wild-type Cyp24a1 (BVECyp24a1-wt)
developed PTC at 5 weeks of age. Mice harboring a homozygous
deletion of Cyp24a1 (BVECyp24a1-null) exhibited a 4-fold reduction
in tumor growth. Notably, we found the tumorigenic potential of
BVECyp24a1-null-derived tumor cells to be nearly abolished in immu-
nocompromised nude mice. This phenotype was associated with
downregulation of the MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and TGFb signaling path-
ways and a loss of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
BVECyp24a1-null cells, associated with downregulation of genes
involved in EMT, tumor invasion, and metastasis. While calcitriol
treatment did not decrease cell proliferation in BVECyp24a1-null cells,
it strengthened antitumor responses to the BRAFV600E inhibitor
PLX4720 in both BVECyp24a1-null and BVECyp24a1-wt cells. Our find-
ings offer direct evidence that Cyp24a1 functions as an oncogene in
PTC, where its overexpression activates multiple signaling cascades
to promote malignant progression and resistance to PLX4720
treatment. Cancer Res; 77(8); 2161–72. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common type of
thyroid cancer, accounting for more than 80% of thyroid cancer
cases (1). The BRAFV600E mutation is the most frequent genetic
alteration in PTC, occurring in 28% to 83% of cases with an
average rate of 44% (2–4). Constitutive activation of the RAS–
RAF–MEK–ERK MAP kinase signaling pathway (MAPK) promotes
the initiation and progression of PTC.
Vitamin D is mainly involved in bone and mineral metabolism.
It has other important functions, such as the modulation of cell
growth and immune function (5). Its antiproliferative effects have
attracted great enthusiasm in recent years for its potential appli-
cation as an anticancer agent. Significant antiproliferative effects
have been observed in many human cancer cells, including
thyroid, prostate, breast, colorectal, and lung cancers (6–9).
Vitamin D receptor (VDR) knockout mice displayed a higher
incidence of carcinogen-induced breast and skin tumors (10),
and vitamin D deficiency promotes human breast cancer growth
(11). Although clinical trials have shown the potential therapeutic
effects of calcitriol in prostate cancer patients (12), the success has
not been convincing regarding the clinical effects of vitamin D or
its analogues in cancer treatment (13, 14). This may be due to the
overexpression of CYP24A1 in many cancer patients.
Vitamin D 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) is the primary vitamin
D-inactivating enzyme, which catabolizes 1a, 25(OH)2D3 (calci-
triol) and, to a lesser extent, 25(OH)2D3 by 24 hydroxylation into
inactive 1a, 24,25(OH)3D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 (6). The calci-
triol-mediated antiproliferative effects could be disrupted by
CYP24A1 overexpression during tumor development (7). Indeed,
CYP24A1 overexpression has been observed in many cancers,
including thyroid (15, 16), lung (17), colon (18), esophageal
(19), and breast (20), and has been linked to poor prognosis in
patients with lung (21), esophageal (19), colon (22), and thyroid
(16, 23) cancers. It has been proposed as a candidate oncogene
due to its gene amplification in breast cancer (24). In patients
with thyroid cancer, the serum calcitriol level was found to be

 significantly lower (25), although there was no significant differ-
ence in the serum 25(OH) D3 level between thyroid nodule and
thyroid cancer patients (25, 26), indicating that calcitriol might be
converted to inactive 1a, 24,25(OH)3D3 by increased CYP24A1
expression. Although these data suggest that CYP24A1 overexpres-
sion could result in the abrogation of calcitriol-mediated growth
arrest leading to tumor development and/or progression, there are
no in vivo functional studies to support this hypothesis.
In our previous study, we demonstrated that CYP24A1 over-
expression was associated with BRAFV600E mutation and advanced
stages of PTC (23). We also showed that BRAFV600E induced
CYP24A1 overexpression and the BRAFV600E inhibitor PLX4720
significantly enhanced the antiproliferative effects of calcitriol in
thyroid cancercell lines (23). However, it is not clear to what extent
CYP24A1 overexpression contributes to thyroid cancer develop-
ment and progression in vivo, especially in the presence of
BRAFV600E. In the present study, we used a mouse model of
BrafV600E-induced PTC to investigate the role of Cyp24a1 in thyroid
cancer progression. We observed that thyroid cancer growth was
significantly reduced in the absence of Cyp24a1 expression.
Materials and Methods
Animals
The generation of TPO–BrafV600E and Cyp24a1 knockout mice
(Cyp24a1null) have been described previously (27–29). TPO-
BrafV600E mice with wild-type Cyp24a1 (BVECyp24a1-wt) developed
PTC at approximately 5 weeks of age and were used as PTC tumor
controls. TPO-BrafWT mice with wild-type Cyp24a1 were used as
normal controls. TPO-BrafV600E mice with Cyp24a1 knockout
(BVECyp24a1-null) were obtained by several rounds of breeding
among LSL-BrafV600E(30) TPO-Cre (31), and Cyp24a1þ/� mice.
Because 50% of the homozygous mutant Cyp24a1null mice died
before 3 weeks of age (29), the mice were kept in a heterozygous
state (Cyp24a1þ/�). To knockout Cyp24a1 in TPO–BrafV600E mice,
Cyp24a1þ/� mice were first crossed with LSL–BrafV600E or TPO–
Cre mice to generate a Cyp24a1þ/�; BrafV600E strain or TPO–Cre;
Cyp24a1þ/� strain. Cyp24a1þ/�; BrafV600E mice and TPO–Cre;
Cyp24a1þ/� mice were then bred together to create TPO–
BrafV600E–Cyp24a1�/� or null mice. Female athymic BALB/c-nu/nu
mice (6–10 weeks of age) were acquired from The Jackson
Laboratory. Mice were provided with autoclaved food and water
ad libitum. The study was approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of the institution and conducted in compliance with
the Public Health Service Guidelines for the Care and Use of
Animals in Research.
Genotyping of transgenic mice
The genotyping of Cre-mediated recombination of the LSL–
BrafV600E targeted allele has been described previously (27).
Briefly, the following primers were used to detect LSL–BrafV600E
recombination in the mouse tissue: primer A, 50-AGTCAATCA
TCCACAGAGACCT-30; primer B, 50-GCTTGGCTGGACGTAAA-
CTC-30; and primer C, 50-GCCCAGGCTCTTTATGAGAA-30. Pri-
mers A þ C detected the wild-type allele (466 bp) and Cre-
recombined BrafV600E allele (518 bp). Primers B þ C detected
the LSL–BrafV600E allele (140 bp). For genotyping the Cyp24a1-
knockout mice, the following primers were used: primer 1, 50-
GCAGCATCTCCACAGGTTCACTGTC-30; primer 2, 50-AAGAT-
CAACCCCTTCGCTCATCTCC-30; and primer 3, 50-CGCATCGC-
CTTCTATCGCCTTC-30. Primers 1 þ 2 detected the wild-type
allele of 250 bp, and primers 1 þ 3 detected the mutant allele
of 600 bp. The PCRconditions were as follows: 94�C for 5 minutes
followed by 35 cycles of amplification (94�C for 30 seconds, 58�C
for 30 seconds, 72�C for 1 minutes) with a final extension at 72�C
for 10 minutes.
Establishment of thyroid tumor cell lines
Thyroid tumors were collected aseptically from donor mice
(BVECyp24a1-wt and BVECyp24a1-null) using blunt dissection, then
mechanically dissociated by mincing and passing through a 40-
mm/mesh sterile screen, and suspended in DMEM/F12 growth
medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100
mg/mL streptomycin). The cells were further dissociated by incu-
bation in growth medium containing 100 U/mL type I collage-
nase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1.0 U/mL dispase I (Roche Diagnostics)
at 37�C in a rocking water bathfor 60 minutes. The cell suspension
was washed twice with growth media and resuspended in a 10-
mm culture dish with DMEM/F12 growth medium containing 4
mU/mL bovine TSH (Sigma-Aldrich) to establish BVECyp24a1-wt
and BVECyp24a1-null cell lines. The established cell lines were
propagated in DMEM/Ham's F12 growth medium. Two cell
lines were established each from two separate BVECyp24a1-wt or
BVECyp24a1-null primary thyroid tumors in 2015: BVECyp24a1-wt-1,
BVECyp24a1-wt-2, BVECyp24a1-null-1, and BVECyp24a1-null-2. The thy-
roid origin of these cell lines was confirmed by genotyping in the
lab as described above, which was performed 1 month before
using the cell lines.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis for Cyp24a1 expression
Total RNA was isolated from the thyroid tumor tissues of
BVECyp24a1-wt mice and BVECyp24a1-null mice by the quanidinium
thiocyanate–phenol–chloroform method (32). The integrity of
the RNA was verified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Two
micrograms (mg) of each total RNA was reverse-transcribed to
cDNA using the Promega RT system (Promega). The LightCycler
DNA Master SYBR Green 1 Kit was used for quantitative real-time
PCR analysis (33). The cDNA mix was diluted 10-fold, and 2 mL of
the dilution was used for real-time PCR analysis. The PCR primers
for the 126-bp Cyp24a1 cDNA fragment were: 50-CATCGCAAC-
GAAGCCTACGGG-30 (sense, located in exon 2) and 50-CTCATT-
GATTTTCTTGTCCAGC-30 (antisense, located in exon 3). The
sense primer spans over 756 bp intron 2 so that the contaminated
genomic DNA would not be amplified. The Cyp24a1 cDNA
fragment was verified by DNA sequencing. The mRNA level of
the housekeeping gene Actb (b-actin) was used as an internal
control, and a 180-bp PCR product was amplified using the
following
two
primers:
50-AAATCGTGCGTGACATCAAA-30
(sense) and 50-AAGGAAGGCTGGAAAA GAGC-30 (antisense).
The PCR conditions are 94�C for 30 seconds followed by 30
cycles of amplification (94�C for 10 seconds, 48�C for 5 seconds,
and 72�C for 10 seconds). The resulting concentration of Cyp24a1
PCR products was normalized by comparison with b-actin and
was used to determine the relative mRNA level of Cyp24a1 in the
thyroid tumors (ddCt method; ref. 33).
Thyroid stimulating hormone measurements
Blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Serum thyroid stim-
ulating hormone (TSH) was measured using the MILLIPLEX MAP
Mouse Pituitary Magnetic Bead Panel following the manufac-
turer's instructions (EMD Millipore Corporation).

 Histology and immunohistochemistry
Histology and immunohistochemical staining were performed
as described previously (34). Briefly, 4-mm-thick formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissue sections were prepared and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or with a Ki67 antibody (1:100
dilution, ab16667, Abcam). A DAKO LSAB þ kit using horserad-
ish peroxidase (HRP) was used for immunostaining (DAKO). The
sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin.
Cloning and expression of Cyp24a1 in BVECyp24a1-null cells
The Cyp24a1 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1 as described
previously (35). The expression construct was transfected into the
BVECyp24a1-null cell line using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and
selected for 4 weeks with 400 mg/mL zeocin. Stable clones were
pooled and used for subsequent experiments.
Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were obtained by extraction in RIPA buffer (20
mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA,
1% NP-40) containing Pierce's Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(Thermo Scientific). The protein concentration was determined
by Bradford's assay using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).
The proteins (40 mg) were separated on a 12% SDS–polyacryl-
amide gel and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. Western blot
analysis was performed using antibodies (1:1000 dilution, Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc.) against phospho-Erk 1/2 (#4370),
phosphor-Akt (#4060), p-Smad2 (#3101), E-cadherin (#3195),
Snail (#3879), vimentin (#5741), and vitamin D receptor
(#12550), or antibodies against Zeb1 (1:1000 dilution, sc-
25388,Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or CYP24A1 (1:1000 dilution,
ab 109632, Abcam).
Wound-healing assay
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (105 cells/well), and a linear
scratch was created with a sterile pipette tip when cells reached
confluent monolayer. The cells were rinsed three times with
medium to remove cellular debris. Cell migration or wound-
healing was monitored by microscopy after 16-hour culture.
Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was measured by a nonradioactive MTT assay
kit according to the manufacturer's procedure (Promega Corp).
Briefly, the cells were plated in triplicate into 96-well plates (103
cells/well) in growth medium containing vehicle (0.5% DMSO),
different concentrations of calcitriol (Sigma-Aldrich), PLX4720
(Selleck Chemicals), or both for up to 72 hours. For the final
4 hours of incubation, 20 mL of CellTiter 96 AQueous One
Solution reagent was added into each well for the measurement
of cell viability.
Colony formation assay
Cells were plated into 12-well plates (5 � 102 cells/well) and
cultured for 14 days in the presence of different concentrations of
calcitriol, PLX4720, or both. The cells were then fixed with
methanol for 10 minutes and stained with 0.5% crystal violet
dye (in methanol:deionized water, 1:5) for 10 minutes. After three
washes with deionized water to remove excess crystal violet dye,
the crystal violet dye was released from the cells by incubation
with 1% SDS for 2 hours before optical density (OD)570 nm
measurement.
RNA sequencing for quantification of differentially expressed
genes
Total RNA from BVECyp24a1-wt-1 and BVECyp24a1-null-1 cell lines
was isolated, and libraries were constructed using an Illumina
TruSeq RNA Library Prep kit according to the manufacturer's
procedure. All sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq
4000 with at least 20 million clean reads. The significant differ-
entially expressed genes (DEG) were selected based on the fol-
lowing criteria: Log2-fold change >2, false discovery rate (FDR)
<0.001, and P value from difference test < 0.01. Selected DEGs
were verified by qRT-PCR, and their primer sequences are pro-
vided in Supplementary Table S1.
Statistical analysis
Student t test (two-tailed) was used to compare two groups, and
one-way ANOVA was used to compare multiple groups. A P value
of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.
Results
Reduction of thyroid tumor growth in BVECyp24a1-null mice
We examined Cyp24a1 expression by qRT-PCR in normal
thyroid tissues from 8 TPO-BrafWT mice and 2 thyroid tumors
from different age groups of BVECyp24a1-wt mice (from 1 to 6
months old). Consistent with our previous findings in human
PTC, the Cyp24a1 expression was increased by more than 3
times in 1-month-old thyroid tumors from both male and
female mice with BrafV600E mutation. The Cyp24a1 expression
was gradually increased as they aged up to 7 to 9 times in 6-
month-old tumors as compared with normal thyroids (Fig. 1A,
P < 0.001). To investigate the effect of Cyp24a1 overexpression
on thyroid tumor growth in the presence of the BrafV600E
mutation, we knocked out the Cyp24a1 gene by cross-breeding
BVECyp24a1-wt mice with Cyp24a1null mice. The Cyp24a1 knock-
out was confirmed by genotyping (Fig. 1B). As shown
in Fig. 1C, thyroid tumor growth was significantly reduced in
BVECyp24a1-null compared with BVECyp24a1-wt mice. Among 12
age- and sex-matched pairs (3 pairs in each group), the thyroid
tumor load at different ages was reduced by an average of 4-fold
in BVECyp24a1-null mice (35.00 � 11.73 mg vs. 127.5 � 43.78 mg
in BVECyp24a1-wt mice, P < 0.05, Fig. 1C). The papillary archi-
tecture of thyroid tumors was lost and replaced by a more
compact structure with reduced immunostaining of the cell
proliferation marker Ki67 (Fig. 1D). These observations were
not found in the heterozygous Cyp24a1-knockout mice carrying
the BrafV600E mutation (data not shown). The phenotype of
BVECyp24a1-null mice was similar to that of BVECyp24a1-wt mice,
and their body weight was approximately half of the normal
mice. Both BVECyp24a1-null and BVECyp24a1-wt mice had severe
hypothyroidism with elevated levels of serum TSH greater than
50,000 pg/mL (n ¼ 5), which was beyond the detection limit of
the assay and more than 100-fold higher than normal TPO-
BrafWT mice (n ¼ 5, 394.3 � 8.7 pg/mL). These data indicate
that the loss of Cyp24a1 had no impact on hypothyroidism
caused by the BrafV600E mutation.
Tumorigenicity of BVECyp24a1-null-derived tumor cells
Due to impaired vitamin D catabolism, 50% of Cyp24a1null
mice died before 3 weeks of age (29, 36). A similar mortality rate
was found in BVECyp24a1-null mice, and the remaining mice could
live up to 6 months. Because we could not maintain sufficient

 numbers of BVECyp24a1-null mice to evaluate the long-term effect of
Cyp24a1-knockout on tumorigenicity and survival, we instead
established thyroid tumor cell lines from BVECyp24a1-null and
BVECyp24a1-wt mice and injected them subcutaneously into nude
mice (n ¼ 5) to observe tumor growth. The BVECyp24a1-null cells
expressed neither functional Cyp24a1 nor responded to calcitriol
stimulation to induce Cyp24a1 expression (Fig. 2A). The residual
Cyp24a1 expression detected by qRT-PCR was likely truncated
transcripts (without exon 9 and 10) undergoing nonsense-medi-
ated decay. The CYP24A1 protein was not detected in the
BVECyp24a1-null cells and reappeared after transfection of Cyp24a1
cDNA (Fig. 2B). Cyp24a1 transcripts from BVECyp24a1-wt cells were
significantly increased following 16 hours of calcitriol stimulation
(Fig. 2A). However, no change in the CYP24A1 protein level was
observed following 100 nmol/L calcitriol stimulation for 48
hours. The elevated protein level was demonstrated after 72 and
96 hours of stimulation (Fig. 2B and C). The delay in protein
synthesis after calcitriol stimulation may be due to the feedback
inhibition by the already elevated CYP24A1 protein level and/or
abrogated vitamin D signaling in the BrafV600E-induced thyroid
cancer cells. VDR expression was increased in all the cell lines after
calcitriol stimulation. The basal level of VDR expression and its
induction by vitamin D were reduced in BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells
(Fig. 2B). These data provided evidence that vitamin D signaling

tumors or cell lines are shown by 250-bp (detected by primers 1 þ 2) and 600-bp (detected by primers 1 þ 3) fragments, respectively. Primers A þ C detected the
wild-type allele (466 bp) and Cre-recombined BrafV600E allele (518 bp). Primers B þ C detected the LSL–BrafV600E allele (140 bp). The 140-bp fragment
was not detected in the cell lines, indicating complete Cre-mediated recombination and thyroid cell origin. C, Thyroid tumor growth in BVECyp24a1-null mice. Thyroid
tumor growth was compared among 12 age- and sex-matched pairs (three in each group) of BVECyp24a1-null and BVECyp24a1-wt mice for up to 6 months. Thyroid

 was intact and there was no amplification of vitamin D signaling
as a result of Cyp24a1 deletion. As shown in Fig. 2D, the tumor-
igenicity of BVECyp24a1-null cells from both BVECyp24a1-null-1 and
BVECyp24a1-null-2 cell lines was significantly decreased. The tumor
weight at 4 weeks after injection of 2 � 106 cells was 0.10 � 0.01 g
from BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells and 0.09 � 0.02 g from BVECyp24a1-

0.39 g from BVECyp24a1-wt-2 cells (P < 0.001), a 19-fold reduction
in the tumorigenic potential (Fig. 2D and E). The tumorigenic
potential was partially recovered after reexpression of wild-
type Cyp24a1 in the BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells (0.1 � 0.01 g in
BVECyp24a1-null-1 vs. 0.51 � 0.09 g in BVECyp24a1-null-1Cyp24a1,
P < 0.001; Fig. 2D and E).
Reduction in MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and TGFb signaling pathways in
the BVECyp24a1-null-derived tumor cells
To investigate the mechanisms that resulted in the loss of
tumorigenic potential, we studied the p-Erk, p-Akt, and p-Smad2
levels in the two BVECyp24a1-null cell lines established from two
separate tumors by Western blot analysis. Increased phosphory-
lation of these proteins was reported to be associated with tumor
progression in thyroid cancer (37, 38). As shown in Fig. 3A, their
phosphorylation levels were decreased in both BVECyp24a1-null cell
lines. We also found significant reduction of Snail and ZEB1
expression in the BVECyp24a1-null cell lines (Fig. 3B). Both Snail
and ZEB1 are zinc finger transcription factors that promote
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) by downregulating the

group at 4 weeks after injection. Tumorigenic potential was significantly reduced after the loss of CYP24A1 expression. The tumor growth potential was
partially restored in the BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells following transfection of wild-type Cyp24a1 expression plasmid.

 expression of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin (39, 40). As
expected, E-cadherin expression was increased and the expression
of the mesenchymal cell marker vimentin was not detected (Fig.

Furthermore, cell migration was reduced in the BVECyp24a1-null

and p-Smad2 levels were increased, and E-cadherin expression
was decreased in the BVECyp24a1-null-1Cyp24a1 cells. The reexpres-

Synergistic effects of calcitriol and BRAFV600E inhibitor
PLX4720 against PTC cells
Because CYP24A1 catabolizes calcitriol, we expected increased
calcitriol-mediated growth arrest in BVECyp24a1-null cells. To our
surprise, we did not find any significant difference in cell prolif-
eration between BVECyp24a1-wt-1 and BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells before
or after calcitriol treatment (Fig. 4). This was confirmed by a
nonradioactive MTS assay (200 nmol/L for up to 72 hours, data
not shown). Next, we investigated whether the combination of
calcitriol andPLX4720 could enhance theantiproliferative effect of
PLX4720. Both BVECyp24a1-wt-1 and BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells were
treated with calcitriol or PLX4720 alone or in combination for a
short term (up to 72 hours) and long term (14 days). The short-
termeffectswere determined bya nonradioactiveMTSassay forcell
proliferation, and the long-term effects were measured by a colony
formation assay. The synergistic effects were not found during
short-term culture (data not shown). A significant reduction in cell
proliferation was, however, found during the long-term culture
when BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells were cultured in the presence of
PLX4720 for 14 days (Fig. 4). BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells were more
sensitive to PLX4720 than BVECyp24a1-wt-1 cells: 32% versus 75%
viable cells after 8 mmol/L PLX4720 treatment (P < 0.0001).
Although calcitriol alone had no significant effect, it synergized
the antiproliferative effects of PLX4720, resulting in further reduc-
tion in cell viability to 9% in BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells after combined
treatment of 8 mmol/L PLX4720 and 200 nmol/L calcitriol versus
32% from single treatment of 8 mmol/L PLX4720 (P < 0.0001,
Fig. 4). The synergistic effects could also be demonstrated in
BVECyp24a1-wt-1 cells: 18% viable cells after combined treatment
of 8 mmol/L PLX4720 and 200 nmol/L calcitriol versus 75% viable
cells after 8 mmol/L PLX4720 treatment alone (P < 0.0001, Fig. 4).
Similar results were also observed in the BVECyp24a1-wt-2 and
BVECyp24a1-null-2 cells (data not shown). To further confirm that
CYP24A1 overexpression caused resistance to PLX4720, we tested
BVECyp24a1-null-1Cyp24a1 cell line, which overexpressed the
CYP24A1 protein. As shown in Fig. 4, BVECyp24a1-null-1Cyp24a1
cells became resistant to PLX4720 treatment: 50% viable cells
versus 32% for BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells after 8 mmol/L PLX4720
treatment (P < 0.0002). The calcitriol-mediated complementary
effect was also reduced in BVECyp24a1-null-1Cyp24a1 cells: 27%
viable cells versus 9% after combined treatment with 8 mmol/L
PLX4720 and 200 nmol/L calcitriol (P < 0.0002, Fig. 4). The
synergistic effects of the combined treatment were still obvious
when lower concentrations (2 mmol/L PLX4720 and 50 nmol/L
calcitriol) were used in BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells: 18% from a com-
bined treatment versus 53% from a single PLX4720 treatment
(P < 0.0001). In BVECyp24a1-wt-1 cells, however, the synergistic
effects of combined treatment were not significant at the

Impact of Cyp24a1 deletion on vitamin D and non–vitamin D-
responsive genes
To investigate the impact of Cyp24a1 deletion on global
gene expression of vitamin D and non–vitamin D-responsive
genes, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of
BVECyp24a1-wt-1 and BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells before and after calci-
triol stimulation (100 nmol/L for 16 hours). Differentially
expressed genes (DEG) with log2 ratio of BVECyp24a1-wt-1 þ
D3/BVECyp24a1-wt-1 > 2 (4-fold difference in gene expression after
vitamin D stimulation) were selected as vitamin D–responsive
genes. A total of 80 DEGs met the selection criteria as vitamin D–
responsive genes and their transcript levels were compared
amongBVECyp24a1-wt-1, BVECyp24a1-wt-1þD3,BVECyp24a1-null-1,and
BVECyp24a1-null-1þ D3. There were few significant changes in gene
expression among vitamin D–responsive genes between BVE-
Cyp24a1-wt-1 and BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells: only 33 DEGs (17 down-
and 16 upregulated) in BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells (Fig. 5A; Supplemen-
tary Table S2). Several downregulated genes are known to be
involved in tumor progression and metastasis: Aldh1l2, Efemp1,
Gjb2, Krt17, Mmp13, Mmp17, and Notum (Supplementary Table
S2). Among 16 upregulated genes, most of them had either
unknown functions or their functions were paradoxically related
to tumor progression (Mmp3, Kcnh1, and Krt16) except for Pdlim2
and Pigr, which might play a role in tumor growth inhibition
(Supplementary Table S2). Pathway analysis showed potential
interactions among Gjb2, Mmp13, Mmp17, Efemp1, and Pdlim2,
affecting the extracellular matrix proteins, matrix metalloprotei-
nase, and EMT (Fig. 6A). By contrast, 761 DEGs did not meet the
selection criteria as vitamin D–responsive genes and were consid-
ered as non–vitamin D-responsive genes: 193 upregulated and 568
downregulated in BVECyp24a1-null-1 versus BVECyp24a1-wt-1 cells.
We selected top 100 DEGs with log2-fold change >6.57 (more
than 95-fold difference in gene expression) for further analysis. A
distinct pattern of gene expression was demonstrated between
BVECyp24a1-wt-1 and BVECyp24a1-null-1 cells (Fig. 5B). Only 3 vitamin
D–responsive genes were present: Efemp1, Hist2h2aa2, and Ppp1r2-
ps3.The genesreportedtobeinvolved intumor growth/progression
or invasion/metastasis are listed in Table 1. Their relevant
functions are provided in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.
We verified 13 DEGs from Table 1 by qRT-PCR and the results
were consistent with the RNA-Seq data (Fig. 5C and D). Many
of these genes are involved in the regulation of b-catenin/Wnt
(Tff1", Olfm4", Fscn1#, Cdh6#, Dkkl1#, and Notum#, resulting in
downregulation of b-catenin), TGF-beta (Nes#, Dlx2#), and
Notch (Pdzrn4#, Lnx1#, and Msx1") signaling pathways, and
may contribute to tumor regression. The significant downre-
gulation of a group of EMT-promoting genes (Efemp1, Fscn1,
Cdh6, Prrx1, Fut4, Hoxd9, Ctsz, Acp5, and Nes) may explain the
loss of EMT in the BVECyp24a1-null cells (Fig. 6). Interestingly,
many of them are homeobox transcription factors: Msx1, Cdx2,
Hoxd9, Prrx1, Hoxc5, En1, and Dlx2.
Discussion
In the present study, we have demonstrated in vivo that
CYP24A1 overexpression cooperates with oncogenic BrafV600E to
promote thyroid cancer progression. The oncogenic potential of
BrafV600E is significantly reduced after Cyp24a1 knockout. Further-
more, a synergy against thyroid cancer cells is observed between
calcitriol and the BRAFV600E inhibitor PLX4720, which may have
immediate clinical translation for thyroid cancer patients, espe-
cially those who are resistant to targeted therapy by vemurafenib
(PLX4032), which is the pharmacologic form of PLX4720 and has
the same mode of action as PLX4720.
CYP24A1 overexpression has been reported in many cancers
and can lead to the abrogation of growth control mediated by
vitamin D. Multiple mechanisms are involved in its overexpres-
sion: gene amplification in breast and colon cancers (24, 41),
miR-125b downregulation in breast cancer (42), and protein
kinase CK2 activation in prostate cancer (43). Its overexpression
is associated with poor prognosis in patients with lung (21),
esophageal (19), colon (22), and thyroid (16, 23) cancers. These
studies have clearly shown that CYP24A1 overexpression can be
used as a biomarker for prognosis prediction, but its role in
cancer development and progression has not been fully evalu-
ated in vivo. The current study provides direct evidence that its
overexpression promotes thyroid cancer growth and progres-
sion by upregulation of multiple signaling pathways, such as
MAPK, PI3K/Akt, TGF-b, and EMT. Cyp24a1 encodes vitamin D
24-hydroxylase, which catabolizes calcitriol into inactive 1a,
24,25(OH)3D3. Calcitriol exerts its antiproliferative effects via
cross-talk with other signaling pathways, including MAPK,
PI3K/Akt, and TGFb (7, 44). The upregulation of multiple
signaling pathways may be due to increased degradation of
calcitriol by Cyp24a1 overexpression, but a more plausible
explanation would be that Cyp24a1 may have some intrinsic
oncogenic functions apart from catabolizing calcitriol. This
hypothesis is supported by the following observations: (i)
Calcitriol treatment alone had no significant effect on cell
proliferation in Cyp24a1-knockout cell line BVECyp24a1-null; (ii)
The tumor growth of BVECyp24a1-null cells was dramatically
reduced in nude mice without an increase in the serum calcitriol
level; (iii) The tumor growth in nude mice was partially recov-
ered by transfection of Cyp24a1 cDNA into BVECyp24a1-null cells;
(iv) No significant changes in the expression of vitamin D–
responsive genes after Cyp24a1 knockout whereas many non–
vitamin D-responsive genes were affected, including transcrip-
tion factors, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and genes
involved in the immune surveillance and metabolism. These
data indicate that calcitriol alone or elevated vitamin D signal-
ing may not have significant impact on thyroid tumor growth of
BVECyp24a1-null cells. It is the Cyp24a1 deletion that likely con-
tributes to the tumor regression. Although the hypothesis
remains to be confirmed by further studies, the current study
demonstrates that Cyp24a1 overexpression results in upregula-
tion of multiple signaling pathways for thyroid cancer progres-
sion: BrafV600E! Cyp24a1 overexpression ! MAPK, PI3K/Akt,
TGF-b, and EMT activation ! thyroid cancer progression.
Thyroid tumor growth was reduced by 4-fold in BVECyp24a1-null
mice, whereas a 19-fold reduction was found in nude mice
following transplantation of BVECyp24a1-null cells. This was prob-
ably due to elevated serum TSH in the BVECyp24a1-null mice, which
could neutralize the beneficial effects of Cyp24a1 knockout (27).

 One should bear in mind that these tumors were subcutaneous
and they were not in a similar microenvironment compared with
the original tumors. Although tumor growth in nude mice could
be affected by locally produced calcitriol, it is unlikely a major
contributor for tumor regression given that we did not observe
significant reduction of cell proliferation in Cyp24-null cells
following calcitriol stimulation. The current study confirmed that
Cyp24a1-knockout could not reverse the hypothyroidism induced

 by the BrafV600E mutation. It is known that TSH stimulates thyroid
cancer growth and progression, and higher serum TSH is associ-
ated with both thyroid cancer incidence and recurrence (45, 46).
We have shown previously that chronic TSH stimulation leads to
significant hyperplasia and goiter formation, and promotes
KrasG12D-mediated oncogenic transformation of thyroid follicular
cells (34). Due to the high mortality caused by impaired vitamin
D catabolism, we could not evaluate survival in the BVECyp24a1-null
mice. This needs to be performed in a mouse model with con-
ditional Cyp24a1 knockout in the thyroid.
The antiproliferative effects of calcitriol were not demon-
strated in the BVECyp24a1-null cells. This is likely due to the
presence of the BrafV600E mutation, which antagonizes the
antiproliferative effects of calcitriol. These effects were clearly
shown
when
combined
with
the
BRAFV600E
inhibitor
PLX4720. The synergistic effects of calcitriol and PLX4720
have been reported in human thyroid cancer cell lines (23).
Given that vemurafenib has recently been approved for the
treatment of advanced PTC harboring BRAFV600E mutation,
combined treatment may offer better therapeutic outcomes for

 advanced PTC. A clinical trial may be warranted to test the
efficacy of the combined therapy.
Finally, we have uncovered many DEGs that are associated with
tumor growth or metastasis by RNA-Seq analysis, whose expres-
sion is significantly impacted by Cyp24a1 knockout. Most of them
are non–vitamin D-responsive genes. Vitamin D–responsive
genes or their signaling pathways are clearly involved in the
antitumor synergy with PLX4720, even though they may not play
a major role in the BVECyp24a1-null tumor regression. Because the
expression of many non–vitamin D-responsive genes regulating
different cellular processes are impacted by Cyp24a1 knockout,
the alteration of these gene is likely to cause downregulation of
multiple signaling pathways and the loss of EMT, resulting in
tumor regression. Such diverse impacts exerted by Cyp24a1-
knockout indicate that Cyp24a1 is a good candidate for targeted
cancer therapy.
