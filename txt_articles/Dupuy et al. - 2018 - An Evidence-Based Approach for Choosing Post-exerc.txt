Introduction: The aim of the present work was to perform a meta-analysis evaluating
the impact of recovery techniques on delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), perceived
fatigue, muscle damage, and inflammatory markers after physical exercise.
Method:
Three databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web-of-Science were
searched using the following terms: (“recovery” or “active recovery” or “cooling”
or “massage” or “compression garment” or “electrostimulation” or “stretching” or
“immersion” or “cryotherapy”) and (“DOMS” or “perceived fatigue” or “CK” or “CRP” or
“IL-6”) and (“after exercise” or “post-exercise”) for randomized controlled trials, crossover
trials, and repeated-measure studies. Overall, 99 studies were included.
Results: Active recovery, massage, compression garments, immersion, contrast water
therapy, and cryotherapy induced a small to large decrease (−2.26 < g < −0.40) in
the magnitude of DOMS, while there was no change for the other methods. Massage
was found to be the most powerful technique for recovering from DOMS and fatigue. In
terms of muscle damage and inflammatory markers, we observed an overall moderate
decrease in creatine kinase [SMD (95% CI) = −0.37 (−0.58 to −0.16), I2 = 40.15%]
and overall small decreases in interleukin-6 [SMD (95% CI) = −0.36 (−0.60 to −0.12),
I2 = 0%] and C-reactive protein [SMD (95% CI) = −0.38 (−0.59 to−0.14), I2 = 39%]. The
most powerful techniques for reducing inflammation were massage and cold exposure.
Conclusion : Massage seems to be the most effective method for reducing DOMS
and perceived fatigue. Perceived fatigue can be effectively managed using compression
techniques, such as compression garments, massage, or water immersion.

Recovery Techniques and Efficiency
INTRODUCTION
Scientific evidence gathered during the past few decades has
allowed the identification of the most efficient training strategies
for improving physical performance. However, maximizing the
performance capacity of an athlete is not only a matter of
training. It also depends on an optimal balance between training
and recovery in order to prevent maladaptation to accumulated
psychological and physiological stresses induced by the training
load (Meeusen et al., 2013; Soligard et al., 2016).
Indeed, competition and training can induce repeated
eccentric contractions (Ispirlidis et al., 2008) and tissue vibrations
(Friesenbichler et al., 2011) that can lead to muscle damage
(i.e., disruption of structural proteins in muscle fibers and/or
connective tissues), subsequent tissue inflammation, delayed
onset muscle soreness (DOMS), and increased perceived fatigue
(Cheung et al., 2003; Dugué, 2015). Changes in the blood
concentrations of muscle damage indicators [i.e., creatine kinase
(CK)] and inflammatory biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP)
and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] that are observed after exercise and are
associated with the occurrence of DOMS can also be used to
achieve skeletal muscle recovery (Bishop et al., 2008; Banfi et al.,
2009; Stacey et al., 2010; Leal Junior et al., 2011).
These exercise-induced perturbations can lead to a temporary
reduction in muscular force (Brown et al., 1997; Goodall and
Howatson, 2008; Mackey et al., 2008), a disturbed sense of joint
position (Saxton et al., 1995; Paschalis et al., 2007), decreased
physical performance (Twist and Eston, 2009; Burt and Twist,
2011), and/or an increased risk of injury (Cheung et al., 2003;
Barnett, 2006). In this context, it is important for coaches and
sports scientists to optimize the recovery period in order to
manage muscle damage and alleviate DOMS, inflammation,
and fatigue, thereby allowing the athlete to feel less fatigued
and decrease the risk of injury (Cheung et al., 2003; Soligard
et al., 2016) or maladaptation to the training load (Kenttä and
Hassmén, 1998; Meeusen et al., 2013).
In terms of the training frequency of elite athletes, a brief
duration between two training sessions may not be enough to
achieve a complete recovery (Barnett, 2006; Minett and Duffield,
2014), which is defined as the return to homeostasis of various
physiological systems following metabolic and inflammatory
challenges and muscle damage induced by exercise training
sessions (Hausswirth and Le Meur, 2011). The interaction
between the training load, subsequent fatigue and adaptation
is complex (Fröhlich et al., 2014; Halson et al., 2014; Roberts
et al., 2015) and may be modulated (positively or negatively) by
the recovery strategy (Minett and Costello, 2015). Therefore, the
choice of recovery techniques is of utmost importance to enable
the athlete to perform during the next training session feeling
rested, not fatigued, healthy, and injury-free (Hausswirth and Le
Meur, 2011).
Several kinds of recovery interventions have been proposed
to improve recovery after physical exercise (Barnett, 2006;
Bishop et al., 2008; Robson-Ansley et al., 2009; Nédélec
et al., 2013; Kovacs and Baker, 2014), including the following:
compressive techniques, such as massage (Kargarfard et al.,
2016), compressive garments (Marqués-Jiménez et al., 2016),
or water immersion (Leeder et al., 2012); electrostimulation
(Bieuzen et al., 2014a); stretching (Herbert and Gabriel, 2002);
anti-inflammatory interventions relying on cold exposure, such
as cryotherapy (Costello et al., 2015) or cold water immersion
(Poppendieck et al., 2013); and active recovery (Andersson
et al., 2008). Depending on the timing and the context, these
interventions can target either central or peripheral mechanisms
(Minett and Duffield, 2014). The mechanisms underlying the
beneficial effects of recovery may be technique dependent.
However, most of them are share common processes that allow
decreases in exercise-induced muscle damage and inflammation.
Such mechanisms enable a reduction in the space available for
swelling and oedema formation, thereby limiting fluid diffusion
into the interstitial space and facilitating the transport of
metabolites/neutrophils/damage proteins from the muscle to the
blood through changes in blood and lymph flow (Barnett, 2006;
Bishop et al., 2008; Robson-Ansley et al., 2009; Nédélec et al.,
2013; Kovacs and Baker, 2014).
Our knowledge of the dose-response relationship between
different protocols and the magnitude of their impact on
DOMS, fatigue, muscle damage, and inflammatory markers
has greatly improved for each of the recovery techniques, and
some evidence-based recommendations are now available. The
difficulty for athletes, coaches, sports scientists, and medical staff
is that very few studies have compared the impact of these
techniques with the others, and there is a lack of information
to facilitate choosing the best adequate recovery techniques.
Furthermore, no comparisons of the impacts of different recovery
techniques have been presented using a meta-analysis thus far.
Therefore, the aim of the present work is to compare the effects of
the most commonly used recovery techniques on muscle damage,
DOMS, inflammation, and the perception of fatigue induced
by physical exercise through a meta-analysis of the scientific
literature.
METHODS
Literature Search
Three databases, namely, PubMed (1949 to 2017), Embase (1974
to 2017), and Web-of-Science (1945 to 2017), were searched using
the following terms: (“recovery” or “active recovery” or “cooling”
or “massage” or “compression garment” or “electrostimulation”
or “stretching” or “immersion” or “cryotherapy”) and (“delayed
onset muscle soreness (DOMS)” or “perceived fatigue” or
“creatine kinase (CK)” or “C-reactive protein (CRP)” or
“interleukin-6 (IL-6)”) and (“after exercise” or post-exercise”)
for “English” or “French-language” randomized controlled trials,
crossover trials, and repeated-measure studies. In addition, we
completed our literature search with two databases that contain
theses and dissertations (Kinpubs and Sport-Discus) and thereby
included “gray literature” (i.e., literature that is difficult to locate
or retrieve, Moher et al., 1999). The reference lists of the articles
obtained were searched manually to obtain additional studies that
were not electronically identified. This led to the identification of
1693 potential studies for inclusion in the analysis (Figure 1). The
last update was made on November 6, 2017.

Selection Criteria

(1) they implemented an exercise intervention followed by a
recovery intervention and provided relevant details about the
procedures, including the modality, duration and intensity of
exercise; (2) they detailed the modality and timing of the recovery

intervention [repeated sessions of recovery and/or combined
modalities were not included (e.g., ice + massage)]; (3) the
outcome included valid tests and measures of DOMS, perceived
fatigue, muscle damage, and inflammation markers in healthy
humans adults (>18 years to <65 years); and (4) they reported
the number of participants and all the necessary data to calculate
effect sizes. Studies were excluded if they presented results from
a previous publication (duplicated data). Our study protocol
followed the Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM)
(Moher et al., 1999) and the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements
(Moher et al., 2009). The exclusion criteria are detailed in
Figure 1.
Coding for the Studies
Two independent reviewers who were blinded to authors,
affiliations, and the publishing journal independently read and
coded all the included articles (Jadad et al., 1996) using the
PEDro scale (Maher et al., 2003) and the van Tulder scale
(van Tulder et al., 2003). Following this quality assessment,
the same reviewers read and coded each of the studies and
assessed the following moderators: training status (competitive
athletes, recreational athletes, or inactive people), sex (male,
female, or both), exercise duration (minutes), exercise type
[cardiorespiratory exercise (continuous or intermittent) or
resistance exercise], exercise intensity (very light, light, moderate,
vigorous, or maximal; according to the criteria of Garber et al.,
2011), type of recovery (active recovery, stretching, massage,
compression garment, electrostimulation, immersion, contrast
water therapy, cryotherapy, or hyperbaric therapy), temperature
of the immersion (<15◦C, 15 to 35◦C, or >35◦C), level of
immersion (arms, legs, or whole body), temperature of the
cryotherapy chamber (> −80◦C, −80 to −110◦C, or < −110),
and timing of the measurements (<6, 24, 48, 72, >96 h). An
interval scale was used for the coding of exercise duration, while
a nominal scale was used for the coding of the other moderators.
Any disagreement between both reviewers was discussed in a
consensus meeting, and unresolved items were addressed by a
third reviewer for resolution.
Statistical Analysis
Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for
each experimental group using Hedges’ g (Hedges, 1981). In
the studies that used multiple measures of a parameter of
interest, a single composite SMD was calculated to estimate the
overall effect (Borenstein et al., 2009). We decided a priori to
use a random-effects model because the effect of a recovery
intervention might differ according to the type of fatiguing
exercise, training status, sex, or other moderators. Standardized
mean differences were weighted by the inverse of the variance
to calculate the overall effect and 95% confidence interval.
Cohen’s criteria were used to interpret the magnitude of the
SMD: <|0.50|: small; |0.50| to |0.80|: moderate; and >|0.80|:
large (Cohen, 1988). Statistical heterogeneity, which refers to
the percentage of variability between studies that is due to
clinical and methodological heterogeneity rather than sampling
error, was assessed by the I2 statistic (Borenstein et al., 2009).
According to Higgins et al. (2003), I2 values of 25, 50, and 75%
represent low, medium, and high heterogeneity, respectively. The
presence of medium or high heterogeneity may provoke further
investigation through a subgroup analysis of moderator variables
(sex, exercise, training status, technique of recovery, level of
immersion, and water temperature), even if the overall effect is
considered non-significant (35). Weighted SMDs and standard
errors were calculated for each category within the moderator
variables; in addition, 95% confidence intervals were calculated
to determine whether a given SMD was different from 0. A
Q-test based on analysis of variance was performed to test the
null hypothesis that the effect of recovery was similar among
the categories of a moderator variable (Borenstein et al., 2009).
When the null hypothesis was rejected, pairwise comparisons
were performed with a Z test. The statistical significance level
was set at P = 0.05. All calculations were carried out with a
spreadsheet (Excel) and Comprehensive Meta-analysis software
(www.meta-analysis.com).
RESULTS
Overall Results
The

search
identified
1693
potentially
relevant
publications spanning from 1958 to 2017, of which 99 studies
met all the inclusion criteria (80 for DOMS, including 1188
participants and 106 experimental groups; 17 for perceived
fatigue, including 266 participants and 27 experimental groups;
19 for inflammatory markers; and 37 for muscle damage marker).
The numbers of participants and experimental groups for each
inflammatory marker are reported in Figures 2, 3. Funnel
plots that were used to identify a possible publication bias are
presented in Figure 4. With the exception of DOMS (23 studies
out of 57 were distributed toward a positive effect), inflammatory
markers (4 studies out of 39 were distributed toward a positive
effect), and perceived fatigue (9 studies out of 8 were distributed
toward a positive effect), all the other measures were distributed
symmetrically about the mean effect size, suggesting that the
sampling error was random. We also performed a sensitivity
analysis to determine whether the quality score of the studies
should be considered as a possible effect modifier. We did
not find any difference between groups (the criteria for group
allocation was a quality score of 5).

with the other methods. However, this adaptation was not
necessarily associated with a similar magnitude decrease in
perceived fatigue. In fact, we found a large decrease in this
variable (−2.55 < g < −0.88) following the use of massage,
compression garments and immersion, while the other methods
had no significant effects. The time course effects of the recovery
modalities on DOMS and perceived fatigue are presented in

each method on these markers are presented in Figure 4, and the
time course is shown in Figure 6.
Effect of the Immersion Characteristics on
DOMS, Perceived Fatigue, Inflammation,
and Muscle Damage
As shown in Table 1, we found a positive effect of immersion and
contrast water therapy on the magnitude of DOMS [SMD (95%
CI) = −0.47 (−0.77 to −0.18), I2 = 50.55% and −0.40 (−0.73 to
−0.07), I2 = 17.07%, respectively]. In terms of perceived fatigue,
we observed a positive effect following immersion [SMD (95%
CI) = −1.16 (−1.94 to −0.39), I2 = 41.13%], while there was
no change after contrast water therapy [SMD (95% CI) = −0.04
(−0.86 to 0.79), I2 = 0.00%]. The effect of each immersion
procedure (i.e., immersion level and water temperature) on
DOMS and perceived fatigue is presented in Table 2. These
specifics effects of immersion on inflammation and muscle
damage markers are presented in Figure 3. With the exception
of immersion in warm water (>36◦), all the procedures were
associated with similar improvements.
DISCUSSION
In this meta-analysis, we compared the impacts of a single
session of different kinds of recovery techniques after physical
exercise on DOMS, perceived fatigue, inflammatory [interleukin-
6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP)], and muscle damage markers
[creatine kinase (CK)]. The different recovery techniques we
investigated were the following: active recovery, stretching,
massage,
massage
combined
with
stretching,
the
use
of
compression garments, electrostimulation, immersion, contrast
water therapy, cryotherapy/cryostimulation, and hyperbaric
therapy/stimulation. Massage was found to be the most powerful
procedure that induced significant benefits in DOMS and
perceived fatigue, regardless of the subjects (athletes, sedentary
subjects). Additionally, both the use of compression garments
and immersion induced a significant positive impact on the same
variables but with a less pronounced effect. Active recovery,
contrast water therapy and cryotherapy had a positive impact
only on DOMS, whereas massage combined with stretching also
induced benefits in perceived fatigue. The other techniques did
not have a significant impact on DOMS or fatigue but had some
effects on circulating CK, IL-6, and CRP concentrations in the
blood.

Massage
Massage is a very traditional way to improve recovery after
physical exercise both in sports and rehabilitation contexts, and
we found a positive effect of this practice. DOMS is induced
by muscle damage, and massage may increase muscle blood
flow and reduce muscle oedema (Weerapong et al., 2005; Bakar
et al., 2015). A 20–30 min massage that is performed immediately
following or up to 2 h after exercise has been shown to effectively
reduce DOMS for 24 h after exercise (Torres et al., 2012).
Moreover, our results are in accordance with a recent meta-
analysis that reported that massage decreases DOMS for 72 h
after exercise (Guo et al., 2017). We even found a significant
impact up to 96 h after exercise.
In elites athletes (ultra-marathon runners), massage generated
a significant improvement in lowering perceived pain (Visconti
et al., 2015). Such an improvement might impact perceived
fatigue, and our meta-analysis revealed that massage was the
most effective technique to reduce perceived fatigue. Following
intense cycle pedaling, Ogai et al. (2008) clearly found that
perceived fatigue was more effectively reduced by massage than
by passive rest without massage. A reduction in circulating
cortisol (Field et al., 2005) and an increase in the concentration
of beta-endorphins (Kaada and Torsteinb, 1989) have been
proposed to explain the reduction of perceived fatigue following
massage. Indeed, a 16% rise in the concentration of beta-
endorphins in the plasma has been reported following a 30-min
massage after exercise (Kaada and Torsteinb, 1989).
Creatine kinase, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein have
often been evaluated in studies concerning DOMS and fatigue,
as muscle damage and inflammation are involved (Connolly
et al., 2003). In the present meta-analysis, we observed that
massage was the most effective recovery technique for reducing
the concentrations of circulating CK and IL-6 in the blood
after exercise. A decrease in the CK concentration in the blood
might reflect a reduction in muscle damage and also indicate
a faster recovery after exercise (Bishop et al., 2008). Torres
et al. (2012) showed that massage was effective in alleviating
the symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage and was
associated with a decrease in plasma CK activity after eccentric
exercise (Zainuddin et al., 2005). By increasing blood and lymph
flow, massage treatment blunts the CK response due to enhanced
CK efflux from damaged tissues and increased CK clearance
from the blood (Smith et al., 1994). Furthermore, it has been
assumed that massage improves the flushing of neutrophils from
the injured area thereby preventing fiber necrosis and CK efflux
(Zainuddin et al., 2005). Interestingly, a recent report showed a
beneficial effect of massage in decreasing the CK level at 48 h and
72 h in male bodybuilders after intense exercise (Kargarfard et al.,
2016), and this effect was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis
(Guo et al., 2017).
Massage may also modulate immune compounds when
applied after exercise, and these compounds may have a direct
impact on fatigue and signs of exercise-induced muscle damage
(Tejero-Fernández et al., 2015). In an elegant study in which
subjects underwent a series a biopsies of the vastus lateralis
following a period of rest after exercise combined with massage
on one leg and passive recovery on the other, massage therapy was
shown to attenuate inflammatory signaling and IL-6 expression
in muscles after exercise-induced muscle damage (Crane et al.,
2012). Almost no data are available concerning the effect
of massage on CRP concentrations in the blood. Combining
stretching with massage has recently been studied (Delextrat
et al., 2014). A significant reduction in fatigue was shown.
However, discrepancies in the results were found in males and
females, with a faster and shorter reduction in fatigue in females
(Delextrat et al., 2014).
Compression Garments
Similar to massage, both the use of compression garments and
cold water immersion induced a significant and positive impact
on DOMS and perceived fatigue but had a less pronounced effect.
It has been previously reported in a narrative review (MacRae
et al., 2011) and meta-analysis (Hill et al., 2014; Marqués-Jiménez
et al., 2016) that the use of compressive garments after damaging
exercise affected DOMS. Moreover, recent works confirmed these
findings and showed that the effects were still significant at
96 h after exercise (Marqués-Jiménez et al., 2016). Our present
study confirmed the significant impact of compression garments
on DOMS at 96 h after exercise. We also found a significant
decrease in perceived fatigue when compression garments were
used. It has been shown that wearing a whole-body compression
garment over a 24-h period after intense heavy resistance training
significantly reduces perceived fatigue (Kraemer et al., 2010).
The beneficial effect of compression garments on DOMS and
perceived fatigue might be explained by a possible reduction
in the space available for swelling and oedema due to the
compression applied to the limb, smaller changes in osmotic
pressure that might diminish fluid diffusion in the interstitial
space and better venous return (Kraemer et al., 2001).
It has been suggested that using a compression garment may
also reduce exercise-induced muscle damage and inflammation
(Kraemer et al., 2004). However, in our meta-analysis, we

Recovery Techniques and Efficiency
did not observe any significant changes in CK, IL-6, or CRP
concentrations after the use of compression garments following
exercise. This result is in contrast with a former meta-analysis
that found that the use of compression garments was effective for
reducing the CK concentration (Hedges’ g = 0.44, 95% CI 0.17–
0.70) (Hill et al., 2014). In the present meta-analysis, the inclusion
criteria were quite stringent, and this certainly influenced the
number and the quality of the selected studies. Additionally,
in the scientific literature concerning CK concentration and
compression garments, there is a very wide range of study
protocols. Some discrepancies in the findings exist and may
nevertheless be explained by the different recovery period
lengths, the lengths of the applied compression (Rimaud et al.,
2010), the amount of pressure applied and the place (upper limbs,
lower limbs, and even on whole-body) where the compression
is applied (Beliard et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2017; Hill et al.,
2017). Additionally, individual variability in the sensitivity to
blood flow changes may also be of importance (Bishop et al.,
2008; Leeder et al., 2012). Similar remarks can be made for the
absence of changes in IL-6 and CRP concentrations. Moreover, it
previously been expressed that in the majority of the published
works concerning the use of compression garments, the exercise
protocols were not intense enough to induce a sufficient degree
of muscle damage (Pruscino et al., 2013; Bieuzen et al., 2014b).
Immersion
The effect of cold water immersion (CWI) on DOMS and
perceived fatigue was significant, but the effect size was small in
terms of DOMS. A previous meta-analysis indicated that CWI
induced a significant effect that was still observable at 96 h after
exercise when compared with passive recovery (Bleakley et al.,
2012). In the same publication, a lower rating of perceived fatigue
was observed after CWI (Bleakley et al., 2012). The improvement
in overall fatigue through the use of CWI has been reported
in several circumstances after training and competition (e.g.,
soccer tournaments or basketball matches) (Rowsell et al., 2011;
Delextrat et al., 2014). Another meta-analysis showed a positive
effect (SMD = 0.52) of CWI on lowering DOMS after strenuous
exercise in trained athletes and in untrained subjects or those
who exercised recreationally (Leeder et al., 2012). An exposure
of 11–15◦C over 11–15 min was considered to be the optimal
circumstance to obtain a positive impact of CWI after exercise
to reduce DOMS (Machado et al., 2016). In our meta-analysis,
we were able to detect significant differences depending on the
water temperature. We observed that only immersion in water
with a temperature lower than 15◦C had a positive impact on
inflammation. Depending on the type of exercise, the duration
of immersion, the level of immersion and the water temperature,
the outcomes were sometimes at variance.
Several mechanisms have been presented to explain the
benefits of CWI on recovery (Ihsan et al., 2016). A common
explanation of the impact of CWI on DOMS and fatigue is a
reduction in exercise-induced inflammation and muscle damage.
We found a significant positive effect of CWI on the CK
concentration in the blood after intensive exercise, but the effect
size was small. A moderate decrease of circulating CK has
previously been reported with the use of CWI after exercise
(Leeder et al., 2012; Sanchez-Ureña et al., 2015). Both the level of
immersion and the cold temperature of the water may reduce the
formation of oedema and pain sensation after exhaustive physical
exercise (Wilcock et al., 2006a,b). Hydrostatic pressure may
facilitate the transport of fluids from the muscle to the blood and
therefore eliminate metabolites (Wilcock et al., 2006a,b; Leeder
et al., 2012). Vasoconstriction due to cold temperature may also
reduce fluid diffusion into the interstitial space (Eston and Peters,
1999) and locally diminish the inflammatory reaction (Coté et al.,
1988), which in turn may reduce the feeling of pain (Smith,
1991). Cold alone has also a direct analgesic impact (Leppäluoto
et al., 2008). However, some other authors did not detect any
changes in the CK concentration after the use of CWI following
exhaustive physical exercise (Bleakley et al., 2012; Hohenauer
et al., 2015). No significant effect was observed in our meta-
analysis concerning changes in IL-6 and CRP concentrations
in the blood. A similar observation has already been presented
(Halson et al., 2008; Hohenauer et al., 2015).
Contrast Water Therapy
Contrast water therapy (CWT) is often used for recovery
purposes and consists of bathing alternately in warm and cold
water. We found that CWT had a significant impact on DOMS
(though the effect size was small) but not on perceived fatigue.
A systematic review has previously expressed the significant
impact of using this technique to improve recovery (Hing et al.,
2008). A more recent work also showed the effectiveness of
this technique after various forms of exhaustive and damaging
exercises (Bieuzen et al., 2013). CWT was also able to significantly
reduce the perception of pain at 24, 48, and 72 h post-
eccentric exercise (Vaile et al., 2008). Alternating therapy with
cold and warm water immersion induces successive peripheral
vasoconstriction and vasodilation (Bieuzen et al., 2013) and
may reduce the formation of oedema after exercise, influence
inflammatory pathways and decrease the feeling of pain (Higgins
and Kaminski, 1998). Additionally, in the present meta-analysis,
we found that CWT reduced CK concentrations in the blood,
indicating reduced muscle damage.
Active Recovery
Active recovery (AR) had a similar effect to CWT on DOMS (but
with a larger effect size) with no impact on perceived fatigue. The
effect of AR after exhaustive exercise on DOMS has been known
for more than 30 years (Armstrong, 1984). However, the impact
of AR is only significant during a short period after exercise
(Zainuddin et al., 2006). In our meta-analysis, we were not able
to show a superior influence of AR compared with the other
recovery techniques we studied. Similarly, when scrutinizing the
scientific literature, no extra beneficial effect of AR was observed
after high-intensity eccentric exercise when compared with the
benefits obtained from massage and electrostimulation (Weber
et al., 1994). We were not able to detect any influence of AR
on CK, IL-6, and CRP concentrations in the blood. However,
the impact of AR on the CK concentration may depend on the
duration of treatment. For instance, after a rugby contest, 1 h of
low-intensity aquatic exercise had no impact on the circulating
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org

 Dupuy et al.
Recovery Techniques and Efficiency
CK concentration (Suzuki et al., 2004), whereas 7 min of low-
intensity exercise enhanced CK clearance (Gill et al., 2006). The
significant effect of AR may be explained through enhanced
blood flow in muscle tissue, which facilitates the removal of
metabolic waste, and may contribute to a reduction in muscle
lesions and pain (Cheung et al., 2003).
Cryotherapy
Cryotherapy/cryostimulation was effective in reducing DOMS
after exercise but had a rather low effect size. The impact
may, however, be at variance. This is probably due to the large
amount of heterogeneity among the cryostimulation methods
that were used (e.g., exposure in a cold chamber or in a cryo-
cabin where the head was not exposed; the timing of the
exposure either immediately following or 24 h after exercise; the
temperature that ranged from −30 to −195◦C; and the number
of cryostimulation treatments that were used after exercise) and
the exhaustive exercises chosen to induce DOMS and fatigue.
With a cryotherapy/cryostimulation exposure organized after a
physical exercise, Fonda et al. (Fonda and Sarabon, 2013) found
a positive effect of whole body cryotherapy (WBC) on DOMS
after an exposure of 3 min exposure at −140 and −195◦C.
However, Guilhem et al. (2013) and Vieira et al. (2015) did
not find such an effect. In their meta-analysis, Costello et al.
(2015) did not have sufficient evidence to recommend WBC
for preventing muscle soreness. However, our results were in
accordance with the conclusions presented in a recent review by
Lombardi et al. (2017), in which the use of WBC was associated
with an improvement in muscle fatigue, pain, and well-being.
However, the present meta-analysis revealed that the effect on
DOMS exists shortly after exposure, as we found a positive effect
<6 h after exercise. However, this effect is not present after 24 h or
later. Thus, cryotherapy performed 24 h after the end of exercise
is ineffective in alleviating DOMS. Additionally, it seems that
a single cryostimulation treatment does not influence CK and
CRP concentrations in the blood after exercise. However, the
situation may change if a series of cryostimulation treatments
are applied. It has previously been reported that the regular
use of cryostimulation after training may lead to lowering
concentrations of both CK (by 30–40%) (Wozniak et al., 2007;
Banfi et al., 2009) and CRP in the blood (Pournot et al., 2011).
In our meta-analysis, a single cryostimulation treatment after
exercise induced a significant decrease in IL-6 concentration in
the blood.
Stretching/Electrostimulation
In the present work, we did not find any significant influence
of stretching or electrostimulation on DOMS and fatigue. For
some time stretching has not been recommended after exercise
(Herbert and Gabriel, 2002; Herbert et al., 2011), as it might even
lead to an increase in DOMS (Smith et al., 1993). The overall
SMD in our study confirmed that stretching had no positive
impact on DOMS. Moreover, our results at <6 h after exercise
indicated that stretching might even produce DOMS, as initially
reported by Smith et al. (1993). In terms of electrostimulation,
some studies showed positive effects on DOMS (Denegar and
Huff, 1988; Denegar and Perrin, 1992), and some found no effect
(Craig et al., 1996; Butterfield et al., 1997). However, the protocols
used for electrostimulation were different, which may explain, in
part, the discrepancy of the outcomes (Babault et al., 2011).
LIMITATIONS
Despite the scientific interest raised by this meta-analysis, the
methodology is not free of limitations. Both publication and
language restriction bias may have inflated estimates of the effect.
Therefore, care was taken to control for these sources of bias.
Two of the databases used in the literature search (Kinpubs and
Sport-Discus) included theses and dissertations, thereby allowing
access to “gray literature.” Some other limitations specific to the
topic of this meta-analysis probably limited the thoroughness
of the analyses. For example, the efficiency of a particular
recovery technique depends on the type of fatigue induced
by previous exercise. Although we coded the characteristics of
the training load, it was not possible to address its interaction
with the magnitude of the effect, and it might constitute the
cornerstone of the global efficiency of a particular recovery
strategy. Additionally, the quality of the papers was evaluated
according to the PEDro and Van Tulder scales, which are widely
used for assessing the methodological quality of clinical tests.
A completely blind procedure involving the participants or
assessors was impossible for the recovery modalities that were
applied. Thus, the attainable maximum score of these scales
was 8. However, the quality heterogeneity (varying from 4 to
8) of the included studies was controlled by statistical analysis.
A sensitive analysis was performed to determine whether the
quality score of the included studies was of importance. We
found that the outcomes of our analyses were similar when the
studies of lower quality (quality score in Pedro scale lower than
5) and those of higher quality (quality score in Pedro scale higher
than 5) were included. Therefore, no bias in our results stemmed
from the quality of the included studies. Additionally, given the
practical difficulty of blinding the participants, investigators, and
outcome assessors from the recovery modalities, the beneficial
effect arising from the placebo effect of recovery techniques could
not be eliminated.
Some very recently described recovery techniques, such as
laser therapy and vibration platforms, were not included in this
work. The main reason was because there were a very low number
of studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria, which did not
allow the calculation of an effect size to compare with the other
recovery techniques.
Finally, in the present work, our main focus was to evaluate
muscle damage, soreness, perceived fatigue and inflammation,
since these variables are important in short- and long-term
recovery processes. Changes in these variables during the
recovery period might yield some insights about peripheral and
central recovery mechanisms. Since there can be a mismatch
between blood-based measures of inflammation or soreness
and the recovery of short-term muscular performance (Minett
and Duffield, 2014), performance would also have been an
important outcome. However, this factor was not evaluated in
this manuscript. Performance is a complex concept, and there are
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org

Recovery Techniques and Efficiency
many ways to measure it. In many studies, tests and measures
used to assess performance capacity are often not reliable
or comparable. Additionally, many studies do not provide
performance data. As stipulated (Hausswirth and Le Meur, 2011),
recovery can be defined as the return to homeostasis of various
physiological systems following metabolic and inflammatory
challenges and muscle damage induced by exercise training
sessions. When the athlete can meet their previous level of
performance, this does not mean that the athlete has fully
recovered from the previous session of exercise, particularly
if perceived fatigue, muscle damage, DOMS and inflammation
persist.
Although these limitations should be accounted for, it is worth
noting that this is the first meta-analysis to compare several
recovery modalities. Additionally, this meta-analysis may be a
widely applicable tool for sports scientists, coaches, and medical
staff.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we were able to identify several recovery
techniques that can be used after a single exercise session
to induce a reduction in DOMS and/or perceived fatigue.
Among them, massage seems to be the most effective for
both DOMS and perceived fatigue. Water immersion and the
use of compression garments also have a significant positive
impact on these variables but with a less pronounced effect.
Perceived fatigue can be effectively managed using compression
techniques, such as compression garments, massage, or water
immersion. Furthermore, the most powerful techniques that
provide recovery from inflammation are massage and cold
exposure, such as water immersion and cryotherapy. In this
meta-analysis only one recovery session was examined. Further
research should be conducted in order to obtain a clearer
picture of possible recovery techniques that best match athlete
performance. It is of importance to know if similar outcomes
are obtained when the same recovery technique is used on
a regular basis after exercise. Additionally, studies combining
several recovery techniques should be undertaken to investigate
whether synergetic phenomena occur.
