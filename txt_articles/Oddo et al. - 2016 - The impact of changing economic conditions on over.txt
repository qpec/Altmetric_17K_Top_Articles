Abstract
Background—The recent economic recession represents an opportunity to test whether 
decreases in economic resources may have deleterious consequences on childhood overweight/
obesity risk.
Methods—We investigated the association between indicators of changing macroeconomic 
conditions from 2008–2012 and overweight/obesity risk among school-aged children in California 
(n=1,741,712) using longitudinal anthropometric measurements. Multivariate regression, with 
individual and county fixed-effects, was used to examine the effects of annual county-level 
unemployment and foreclosure rates on risk of child overweight/obesity, overall and among sub-
groups (race/ethnicity, sex, county-level median household income, county-level urban/rural 
status).
Results—From 2008 to 2012, approximately 38% of children were overweight/obese and 
unemployment and foreclosure rates averaged 11% and 6.9%, respectively. A 1-percentage point 
(pp) increase in unemployment was associated with a 1.4 pp (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.3, 
1.5) increase in overweight/obesity risk. Therefore, a child of average weight could expect a 14% 
increase in BMI z-score in association with a 1 pp increase in unemployment during the study 
period. We found some differences in the magnitude of the effects for unemployment among 
demographic subgroups, with the largest effects observed for unemployment among American 
Indians and Pacific Islanders.
Conclusion—Comparing children to themselves over time, we provide evidence that increases 
in county-level unemployment are associated with increased overweight/obesity risk. Given that 
overweight among children with lower economic resources remains a challenge for public health,

INTRODUCTION
Persistent disparities in overweight among children with lower economic resources 
compared to those with higher economic resources represents a critical challenge for public 
health in the U.S. [1–3]. Therefore, it is important to understand the impact of significant 
decreases in economic resources at the broader community-level (e.g., business closings, 
changing economic security) on childhood overweight/obesity outcomes. The recent 
economic recession represents an opportunity to test whether changing economic conditions 
have consequences on childhood overweight/obesity risk.
Research on the effects of recessions on weight status is mixed, with some studies in the 
U.S. suggesting that recessions are associated with increased overweight/obesity [4–6] (or 
correspondingly, that improving economic conditions are associated with decreased 
overweight/obesity), [7] while others suggest that recessions are associated with decrease 
overweight/obesity [8, 9]. Most of these studies rely on repeated cross-sectional data, self-
reported anthropometric measurements, or a single measure of economic hardship (e.g., 
unemployment). Prior research utilizes individual-level employment status, which can be 
correlated with unobserved traits that also influence health, thus producing misleading 
associations and fails to capture changes in spending that occur among families who 
perceive greater economic uncertainty, but do not actually become unemployed, and among 
those who have experienced economic hardships, due to potential losses in investments or a 
reduction in work hours [10, 11]. Prior literature is also limited to adults and few studies 
have leveraged longitudinal data to compare the same individual to him- or herself over 
time.
We improve upon previous studies by using measured longitudinal anthropometric 
measurements to examine the impact of macroeconomic indicators on children’s 
overweight/obesity risk. We investigate the association between two indicators of economic 
conditions (county-level unemployment and foreclosure) and overweight/obesity among 
children in California between 2008 to 2012. The overlap between this study period and the 
Recession (December 2007 to June 2009) [12], as well as our ability to overcome major 
sources of confounding by comparing children to themselves over time, provides a unique 
opportunity to better identify changes in children’s weight as a result of changing economic 
conditions.
Economic theory suggests that changing macroeconomic conditions, like those experienced 
during a recession, could impact health through several pathways, including reductions in 
income and changes in time allocation [13]. Lakdawalla and Philipson propose an upside 
down u-shaped relationship between income and BMI and suggest different predicted 
changes in BMI depending on the degree to which income increases or decreases and on

 baseline income [14]. Changing economic conditions may increase weight gain if families 
opt to save money by decreasing their purchase of healthful foods in favor of increasing 
consumption of cheaper, energy-dense foods [15–17], as was recently demonstrated in a 
comparison of the same households pre- and post-recession [18]. However, changing 
economic conditions may decrease children’s risk for weight gain if parental engagement in 
health-promoting activities, such as preparing healthy meals, increases when working hours 
decrease [19] or if households face extreme hardship that leads to a further economizing of 
food purchases, resulting in a decrease in total caloric intake [20].
The primary aim of this paper is to test these competing hypotheses. Based on research 
suggesting that the impact of recessions varies by sociodemographic characteristics [5, 9, 
21–23], the secondary aim of this paper is to assess heterogeneity by race/ethnicity, urban/
rural status, median household income, or child sex.
METHODS
Data Sources
Individual-level measured weight and height, collected by the Department of Education, 
were obtained for children in fifth, seventh, and ninth grade, enrolled in public schools in all 
of California’s 58 counties [24]. We limited our eligible sample to children who had at least 
2 anthropometric measurements, since we were interested in within-child estimates 
(n=1,901,689). Children were excluded for missing height or weight (n=222,775), 
implausible BMI z-score (n=14,324), or race/ethnicity (n=122,878). Our final analytic 
sample included 1,741,712 children aged 7–18 years who were followed between 2008 and 
2012. Over the study period, 83% (n=1,438,992), 17% (n=302,164), and <1.0% (n=556) of 
children had 2, 3, and 4 or 5 measurements, respectively.
County-level annual unemployment estimates (2008–2012) were obtained from the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics. County-level annual foreclosure rates (2008–2012) were obtained from 
RealtyTrac LLC whose data covers more than 90 percent of the U.S. [25]. Three-year 
estimates (2005–2007) of county-level median household income were obtained from the 
American Community Survey (ACS), which were used as an indicator of baseline income.1 
The Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board deemed that this analysis of de-identified 
secondary data was non-human subjects research.
Dependent Variables
The primary dependent variable was overweight/obesity defined as BMI ≥85th percentile 
compared to the age- and sex-specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 2000 growth charts.
1Five year estimates (2005–2009) were used for the following counties because of missing data on the variable of interest due to size: 
Alpine, Inyo, Mariposa, Modoc, Mono, Sierra, and Trinity. Fives year estimates are available for all areas where as three year 
estimates are available for areas with populations ≥ 20,000.

 Independent Variables
We examine aggregate, county-level indicators because they capture broad changes in the 
macroeconomy which affect everyone and not just individuals who became unemployed or 
were foreclosed upon [4, 10, 13, 25, 26]. It is also plausible that becoming unemployed is 
confounded with individual-level characteristics that may also affect health [9, 13]. For 
example, poor work performance may also impact parenting style (e.g. lack of supervision 
of childhood meals) which in turn, affects children weight. Therefore, the main independent 
variables included annual county-level unemployment and foreclosure rates (2008–2012), 
which have previously been associated with adult weight status [5–9]. Unemployment is the 
most widely used indicator of macroeconomic conditions [5–9, 13, 27], however, during the 
recession, foreclosures also represented a significant shock to household’s and community’s 
financial well-being [25]. The recession, indicated by a decline in several metrics of 
economic activity (e.g. real income, employment, retail sales), ended in June 2009 when 
macroeconomic indicators began to increase (i.e., not when economic activity returned to 
pre-recession levels) [12]. However, high unemployment and foreclosure persisted and data 
indicate that median household income fell significantly more from June 2009 to June 2011 
(6.7%) than during the official recession period (3.2%) [28]. Therefore, this study explores 
the impact of changing economic conditions over a five-year period that overlaps with the 
recession, because the recession had longer-term economic impacts beyond its official end 
date [28, 29].
Annual unemployment rate (a percent) was defined as the number of persons unemployed 
divided by the civilian labor force. Annual foreclosure rate (a percent) represented total 
foreclosures divided by the total number of mortgages.
Effect Measure Modifiers and Confounding Factors
Child age was calculated using birth date and the anthropometric measurement date. Race/
ethnicity was self-reported as one of the following categories: American Indian/Alaska 
Native (henceforth, American Indian), Asian, Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian, Filipino, 
Hispanic or Latino, African American or Black, white and, beginning in 2011, two or more 
races. Counties were classified as urban or rural using the 2013 Economic Research Service 
Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC)[30]. Urban was defined as RUCC ≤ 3 and rural was 
defined as RUCC >3 to 9. Using three-year ACS estimates, counties above the statewide 
median household income ($58,316) were defined as high-income, while counties at or 
below the median were categorized as low-income. We used county-level income as an 
effect measure modifier because individual income was not available.
Statistical Analysis
We used fixed-effect linear probability models, with individual- and county-level fixed-
effects, and county-level clustered standard errors [29], to test the relationship between 
overweight/obesity and changing economic conditions (2008–2012) using measures of 
county-level unemployment and foreclosure. This approach allowed us to compare each 
child to him- or herself over time and, in doing so, control for all baseline time-invariant 
measured (e.g., race/ethnicity) and unmeasured (e.g., SES) individual-level factors that may 
influence the selection into the neighborhood where a child resides [31, 32]. For example,

 parental race/ethnicity may influence which county one lives in and child BMI. Fixed-effects 
models also control for unmeasured time-invariant factors, (e.g. food preferences). Our 
ability to eliminate potential sources of confounding, a key limitation in prior analyses, 
allows us to better identify the causal impact of changing economic conditions on children’s 
overweight risk.
Based on prior literature, we hypothesized that macroeconomic conditions might have a 
more pronounced effect for Blacks, Latinos, males, and low-income households [4, 5, 10, 
21–23, 25]. We stratified by race/ethnicity, sex, median household income and urban/rural 
status and assessed heterogeneity in the effects of economic conditions on overweight/
obesity using a post-hoc Wald test of differences. Models included a county indicator to 
account for time-invariant county characteristics related to child weight and macroeconomic 
conditions (which are possible while also including individual fixed-effects because some 
children moved during the study period) and an age by race/ethnicity interaction to control 
for race/ethnicity-specific time trends in overweight/obesity. Linear probability models (i.e., 
ordinary least squares with dichotomous outcomes) are a recommended alternative to 
logistic models when outcomes are common, as well as when risk differences rather than 
ratios are the desired measure of effect [33]. The coefficients from these models are 
probabilities and were multiplied by 100 so that they can be interpreted as the percentage 
point (pp) change. Alpha was set to 0.05 and all analyses were performed using Stata 13.1 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
Sensitivity Analyses
We assessed whether our results would have changed given the following alternative 
specifications: 1) when BMI z-score, underweight and obesity were modeled as the 
outcomes and 2) when unemployment and foreclosure were log-transformed. Since 
approximately 25% of the population of California resides in Los Angeles (L.A.) county, we 
assessed our results when excluding individuals residing in this area. Additional robustness 
checks included excluding children who moved counties (n for non-movers= 1,670,397), 
excluding years after the peak in unemployment (2011–2012), excluding children with 
extreme changes in their BMI z-score (change in BMI z-score > 5) (n =1,128), and 
estimating the association using mixed- and between-effects models.
RESULTS
Table 1 displays demographic and economic characteristics of the sample from 2008 to 
2012. The mean age of the study children (n=1,741,712) was 13 (standard deviation: 1.6). 
Half of the sample was Latino (53%) or male (51%). Approximately 38% of children were 
overweight/obese.
Statewide, unemployment and foreclosure peaked in 2010 at ~14% and ~8% respectively 
(Figure 1). County-level trends in unemployment demonstrate a qualitatively consistent 
pattern across counties, while there was more variation in county-level foreclosure patterns 
(Figure 2). Variation in unemployment and foreclosure rates by county is described in 
Supplemental Table 1.

 A 1 pp increase in unemployment was associated with a 1.4 pp (95% Confidence Interval 
[CI]: 1.3, 1.5) increase in overweight risk (Table 2). The direction of the relationship was 
opposite for foreclosure and the magnitude of the association was considerably lower (Table 
2). A 1 pp increase in foreclosure was associated with a 0.29 pp (95% CI: −0.48, −0.10) 
decrease in overweight/obesity risk.
Heterogeneity
The magnitude of the effects for unemployment was somewhat greater in high-income (1.5 
pp; 95% CI: 1.4, 1.7) and rural counties (1.8 pp; 95% CI: 1.4, 2.2) and among females (1.5 
pp; 95% CI: 1.4, 1.6) (Table 3). The magnitude of the association was highest for American 
Indians (1.8 pp; 95% CI: 1.5, 2.0) and Pacific Islanders (1.8 pp; 95% CI: 1.5, 2.3). The 
estimate for American Indians was significantly greater than those for whites (1.5 pp; 95% 
CI: 1.4, 1.6), Latinos (1.4 pp; 95% CI: 1.3, 1.5), Blacks (1.6 pp; 95% CI: 1.5, 1.7), Asians 
(1.2 pp; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.3), and Filipinos (1.1 pp 95% CI: 0.80, 1.3). The magnitude of 
association among Latinos, Asians, and Filipinos was significantly smaller as compared to 
Pacific Islanders.
The magnitude of association of foreclosure on overweight was smaller for males (-0.23 pp; 
95% CI: −0.41, −0.062) compared to females (-0.34 pp; 95% CI: −0.55, −0.14) (Table 3). 
The foreclosure-overweight relationship was largest among Pacific Islanders (-0.69 pp; 95% 
CI: −1.2, −0.20) and this was greater than whites (−0.19 pp; 95% CI: −0.37, −0.0064), 
American Indians (0.0016 pp; 95% CI: −0.34, 0.34) and Asians (−0.23 pp; 95% CI: −0.52, 
0.0068).
Sensitivity Analyses
The direction and statistical significance of the association between unemployment and 
overweight/obesity remained unchanged in the sensitivity analyses (Supplemental Tables 2–
8). Foreclosure was not significantly associated with BMI z-score or underweight 
(Supplemental Table 2) and the foreclosure–overweight/obesity relationship was no longer 
statistically significant when excluding years after the peak in unemployment (Supplemental 
Table 6). We found that increased unemployment was associated with a significant decrease 
in underweight risk (−1.3 pp; 95% CI: −1.4, −1.1), which is consistent with the primary 
results for overweight (Supplemental Table 2). Results were unchanged in magnitude, 
precision or significance when excluding children with extreme changes in BMI z-score 
(Supplemental Table 7).
DISCUSSION
This study leveraged longitudinal data in order to identify the impact of changing economic 
conditions during the recession on childhood overweight/obesity risk. We found that 
increased unemployment was associated with increased risk of overweight/obesity. 
Increased foreclosure was associated with decreased risk of overweight/obesity, however, the 
magnitude of the unemployment-overweight/obesity association was 5 times larger than the 
magnitude of the association for foreclosure-overweight/obesity and was more robust to 
sensitivity checks. In this sample, a child of average weight (BMI z-score of 0.54 [Table 1])

 could expect a 14% increase in BMI z-score (i.e. a BMI z-score of 0.62 based on β=0.08 
[Supplemental Table 1]) in association with a 1pp increase in unemployment during the 
period of observation. These observed changes in overweight/obesity risk may have 
important implications at the population level given that small changes in weight (5–10%) 
have been shown to change chronic disease risk [34–36]. This study overcomes many of the 
potential sources of confounding by comparing children to themselves over time as the 
economic environment changed around them.
Our analysis of subgroups revealed some differences in the magnitude of the effects for both 
unemployment and foreclosure. However, the estimates were largely in the same direction as 
our primary results and while significant, the differences were small. The largest magnitudes 
of effect were observed for unemployment among American Indians and Pacific Islanders. 
Prior research also suggests recessions disproportionally impact racial/ethnic minorities, 
however, differences have largely been reported among Blacks and Latinos [5, 9, 25]. The 
small differences by household income are consistent with evidence suggesting that higher 
income households reduced the price they paid per calorie during the recession, whereas 
lower income households cut the total number of calories purchased [37]. Small sub-group 
differences between males and females is consistent with literature which finds differences 
in the economic resources-BMI relationship by sex among children and adolescents [1, 2].
Our results are consistent with research that reports aggregate-level unemployment is 
associated with increased overweight/obesity risk [4, 5, 7]. The effects are a combination of 
the effects for children whose families actually experienced unemployment, as well as the 
changes in social norms and the widespread ‘recession mentality’ that occurred due to 
economic uncertainty (i.e. feared loss of income), even among those who did not become 
unemployed [13]. The literature suggests several possible mechanisms through which 
changes in aggregate-level economic conditions could increase overweight/obesity risk. 
Constricting economic resources can render healthful foods unaffordable, leading to 
increased household consumption of cheaper, energy-dense foods [13, 15–18] and decreased 
consumption of fruits and vegetables [17] leading to an overconsumption of energy [38]. In 
times of economic crisis, consumers tend to trade down to lower priced foods, which for 
many households includes fast or take-away foods as demonstrated by stable share prices of 
fast food during the recession [39]. It is plausible that increased unemployment could result 
in local-area budget cuts to after-school programs and sports leagues. Evidence suggests that 
community-level deprivation has been associated with decreased access to places for 
recreation and physical activity [40]. We speculate that the decrease in underweight risk 
would be operating through similar mechanisms as the increase in overweight risk.
We speculate that losing or changing residence as a result of foreclosure may be a more 
extreme form of hardship and may require an even greater economizing that would lead 
families to cut down on their food purchases and reduce food-away-from-home spending 
[20]. Very constrained budgets could lead to decreased overweight, because meager finances 
lead people to consume lower quantities or cook meals at home, which tend to be lower in 
total energy [13, 20]. Foreclosure effects and economizing may persist beyond families 
foreclosed upon as increasing neighborhood blight would result in decreased property value 
and wealth neighborhood-wide [41]. For example, Joshi [26] found that individuals were

 likely to experience worse mental health when local housing prices declined (2005–2011), 
and this association was most pronounced among individuals who were not homeowners. 
Currie and Tekin also find that increased community-level foreclosure was associated with 
higher emergency room visits for mental health, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension, in 
high foreclosure states, including California [25]. The authors hypothesize that these 
associations may be the result of stress resulting from the lengthy foreclosure process (~90 
and 117 days in California) and it is plausible that prolonged stress could result in a greater 
depletion of resources forcing even greater economizing and thus, decreased overweight 
among children.
Consistent with our results, Currie and Tekin [25] employ mutually adjusted models to 
demonstrate that the effects of foreclosure cannot be explained by unemployment (or vis 
versa). Furthermore, those foreclosed upon may be different than those who become 
unemployed and changing economic conditions may differentially impact these populations. 
During the recession, middle-income households faced the highest unemployment rates [42] 
and those foreclosed upon were more likely to be households with children and low-income, 
first-time buyers, many of whom were in minority neighborhoods and may not have 
qualified for loans during other times [23, 43, 44]. A study of subprime borrowers in 
California found that Blacks were significantly more likely than whites to report being 
targeted by unscrupulous mortgage brokers and that lender marketing efforts were the 
impetus for taking out a home equity loan [45]. Subsequently, the economic fallout was 
greatest in Black and Latino neighborhoods [25, 46–49]. If foreclosure is a more extreme 
economic hardship and those who were foreclosed upon or living in high-foreclosure 
communities had lower net resources at baseline, then the opposing direction of effects for 
unemployment and foreclosure could be consistent with an upside down u-shaped 
relationship between income and BMI [13]. But the estimates for foreclosure were much 
smaller in magnitude and more sensitive to model specifications, so should be interpreted 
cautiously.
Our data analysis and approach have several strengths including the use of longitudinal data 
and individual and county fixed-effects, which has previously been described as the ideal 
study design for identifying the effects of economic recessions [9]. This approach allows us 
to control for individual- and county-level measured and unmeasured time-invariant 
confounding. Limitations of this study should also be noted. First, we are not able to control 
for potential unmeasured time-varying confounding; but biased coefficients would only 
result if a factor co-varied with county-level unemployment and foreclosure and affected 
BMI. Although data collectors did receive training on collection of height and weight 
measurements, the anthropometrics were collected during routine physical fitness testing, 
rather than according to a research protocol. Approximately 12% of the children are not 
measured at any time point. We assume that those children measured represent those not 
measured, but if those unmeasured children are systematically different (e.g. systematically 
from less-stable households) than it is possible that the association would have been 
different had they been included in the sample. Using a smaller geographical unit for 
unemployment and foreclosure (e.g. zipcode-level) may have been preferred due to variation 
within counties; however, a data-use agreement prevented us from presenting less aggregate 
estimates for overweight/obesity. Our findings may be less generalizable to non-judicial

 states where the foreclosure process is longer or to states that experienced a less severe 
recession, as unemployment and foreclosure rates in California were higher than the national 
averages [27].
This study enhances our understanding of the impact of changes in economic conditions on 
overweight/obesity risk among children. We improve upon prior studies by comparing 
children to themselves over time and provide evidence that increases in unemployment are 
associated with increased overweight/obesity risk. A better understanding in this area is 
critical given the potential deleterious effects of decreased economic resources resulting 
from unemployment. Future studies should explore the pathways by which different 
economic shocks affect weight status among children in order to inform future policy and 
intervention strategies.

 What is already known on this subject
•
Research on the effects of economic recessions on weight status among adults 
is mixed.
•
Prior studies are limited to adults and rely on repeated cross-sectional data, 
self-reported anthropometric measurements, a single measure of economic 
hardship (e.g., unemployment), or individual-level employment status, which 
can be correlated with unobserved traits that also influence health, thus 
producing misleading associations.
What this study adds
•
The overlap between the study period (2008 to 2012) and the Great 
Recession, as well as our ability to overcome major sources of confounding 
by comparing children to themselves over time, enhances our understanding 
of the extent to which changing economic conditions impact overweight/
obesity risk among children.
•
Results suggest that increased unemployment is associated with a significant 
increase in overweight risk among children. Overweight among children 
remains a challenge for public health. Therefore, it is critical to develop 
policy and intervention strategies which aim to mitigate the impact of 
decreased resources as economic conditions change.
