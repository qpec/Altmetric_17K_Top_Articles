B
acterial bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a major 
cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. 
Approximately 600,000 BSI cases occur annually, re-
sulting in 85,000 deaths,1 at a cost exceeding $1 bil-
lion.2 Traditionally, BSIs have been managed with intravenous 
antimicrobials, which rapidly achieve therapeutic blood con-
centrations, and are viewed as more potent than oral alterna-
tives. Indeed, for acutely ill patients with bacteremia and sep-
sis, timely intravenous antimicrobials are lifesaving.3 
However, whether intravenous antimicrobials are essential 
for the entire treatment course in BSIs, particularly for un-
complicated episodes, is controversial. Patients that are clin-
ically stable or have been stabilized after an initial septic pre-
sentation may be appropriate candidates for treatment with 
oral antimicrobials. There are costs and risks associated with 
extended courses of intravenous agents, such as the neces-
sity for long-term intravenous catheters, which entail risks for 
procedural complications, secondary infections, and throm-
bosis. A prospective study of 192 peripherally inserted central 
catheter (PICC) episodes reported an overall complication rate 
of 30.2%, including central line-associated BSIs (CLABSI) or ve-
nous thrombosis.4 Other studies also identified high rates of 
thrombosis5 and PICC-related CLABSI, particularly in patients 
with malignancy, where sepsis-related complications approach 
25%.6 Additionally, appropriate care of indwelling catheters re-
quires significant financial and healthcare resources.
Oral antimicrobial therapy for bacterial BSIs offers several po-
tential benefits. Direct economic and healthcare workforce sav-
ings are expected to be significant, and procedural and cathe-
ter-related complications would be eliminated.7 Moreover, oral 
therapy provides antimicrobial stewardship by reducing the use 
of broad-spectrum intravenous agents.8 Recent infectious dis-
ease “Choosing Wisely” initiatives recommend clinicians “prefer 
oral formulations of highly bioavailable antimicrobials whenever 
possible”,9 and this approach is supported by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention antibiotic stewardship program.10 
However, the expected savings and benefits of oral therapy 
would be lost should they be less effective and result in treatment 
failure or relapse of the primary BSI. Pathogen susceptibility, gas-
trointestinal absorption, oral bioavailability, patient tolerability, 
and adherence with therapy need to be carefully considered be-
fore choosing oral antimicrobials. Thus, oral antimicrobial therapy 
for BSI should be utilized in carefully selected circumstances.
In this narrative review, we highlight areas where oral therapy 
is safe and effective in treating bloodstream infections, as well

Bacterial bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in the United States. Traditionally, 
BSIs have been managed with intravenous antimicrobials. 
However, whether intravenous antimicrobials are necessary 
for the entirety of the treatment course in BSIs, especially 
for uncomplicated episodes, is a more controversial 
matter. Patients that are clinically stable, without signs 
of shock, or have been stabilized after an initial septic 
presentation, may be appropriate candidates for 
treatment of BSIs with oral antimicrobials. There are risks 
and costs associated with extended courses of intravenous 
agents, such as the necessity for long-term intravenous 
catheters, which entail risks for procedural complications, 
secondary infections, and thrombosis. Oral antimicrobial 
therapy for bacterial BSIs offers several potential benefits. 
When selected appropriately, oral antibiotics offer 
lower cost, fewer side effects, promote antimicrobial 
stewardship, and are easier for patients. The decision 
to use oral versus intravenous antibiotics must consider 
the characteristics of the pathogen, the patient, and the 
drug. In this narrative review, the authors highlight areas 
where oral therapy is a safe and effective choice to treat 
bloodstream infection, and offer guidance and cautions to 
clinicians managing patients experiencing BSI. Journal of

as offer guidance to clinicians managing patients experiencing 
BSI. Given the lack of robust clinical trials on this subject, the 
evidence for performing a systematic review was insufficient. 
Thus, the articles and recommendations cited in this review 
were selected based on the authors’ experiences to represent 
the best available evidence.
INFECTION SOURCE CONTROL
Diagnosing the source of a patient’s BSI is vital to successful 
treatment for 2 reasons. First, without achieving source con-
trol, antimicrobial therapy of any sort is more likely to fail.7 For 
example, patients with Staphylococcus aureus abscess and 
persistently positive blood cultures despite intravenous anti-
microbials require drainage. Similarly, patients with a CLABSI 
typically benefit from removal of the foreign body.11 Second, 
particular oral antibiotics have different penetration levels into 
various tissues (Table 1).12 For instance, if a patient has menin-
gitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae with concurrent BSI, 
doxycycline would be an inferior choice, despite having good 
bioavailability and achieving high blood concentrations, be-
cause it poorly penetrates the central nervous system. An oral 
regimen must adequately penetrate the source of infection.
PATHOGEN AND ANTIMICROBIAL FACTORS
Several important factors regarding the BSI pathogen should 
be considered when deciding on oral versus intravenous ther-
apy, as follows: 1) organism speciation and susceptibilities 
should be available; 2) the pathogen should be susceptible 
to an oral antimicrobial with high bioavailability that achieves 
adequate blood and source-tissue concentrations; 3) the can-
didate antibiotic should have a high barrier to acquired resis-
tance for the pathogen. For example, although S. aureus is 
often susceptible to rifampin, it has a low genetic barrier to 
resistance; thus, rifampin monotherapy is not recommended; 
and 4) the selected agent should generally be well-tolerated 
and have an acceptable safety profile. Table 2 summarizes the 
characteristics of several key antibiotics.
PATIENT FACTORS
Although the causative pathogen may be susceptible to an 
oral antibiotic with favorable pharmacokinetics, several patient 
factors need to be considered. The patient should: 1) have no 
allergies or intolerances to the selected agent; 2) be physically 
able to swallow the medication or have a working gastric or 
jejunal tube in place, as well as have no significant impairment 
in gastrointestinal absorption; 3) have a history of adherence to 
oral therapy, particularly if the regimen is dosed multiple times 
per day, and should be appropriately educated and able to 
demonstrate understanding of the importance of adherence; 
4) take no other medications that may significantly interact with 
the antibiotic; and 5) be able to immediately access the oral 
agent upon discharge from the hospital. Some medical facili-
ties are able to provide new medications to the patient before 
discharge, ensuring availability of oral antibiotic therapy as an

Bioavailability represents the percentage of the dose that reaches systemic circulation. Tissue penetration reflects the drug movement from the vascular to the interstitial and intracellular com-
partments of a particular body site. Drugs passively diffuse through fenestrated capillaries into the interstitial compartment of most tissues. However, some tissue sites (eg, the brain and pros-
tate) contain nonfenestrated capillaries and/or active transport pumps that prevent entry or remove the drug. Tissue concentrations are methodologically dependent on the various techniques 
used in their quantification, and, in some body sites, are influenced by the presence or absence of inflammation (eg, brain tissue). Thus, the values presented here are best approximations.

EVIDENCE REGARDING BLOODSTREAM 
INFECTIONS DUE TO GRAM-NEGATIVE RODS 
BSIs due to gram-negative rods (GNRs) are common and cause 
significant morbidity and mortality. GNRs represent a broad 
and diverse array of pathogens. We focus on the Enterobacte-
riaceae family and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, because they are 
frequently encountered in clinical practice.1
Gram-Negative Rods, Enterobacteriaceae Family 
The Enterobacteriaceae family includes Escherichia coli, Kleb-
siella, Salmonella, Proteus, Enterobacter, Serratia, and Citro-
bacter species. The range of illnesses caused by Enterobacteri-
aceae is as diverse as the family, encompassing most body sites.

Although most Enterobacteriaceae are intrinsically susceptible 
to antibiotics, there is potential for significant multi-drug resis-
tance. Of particular recent concern has been the emergence 
of Enterobacteriaceae that produce extended-spectrum β-lac-
tamases (ESBL) and even carbapenem-resistant strains.14
However, Enterobacteriaceae species susceptible to oral an-
timicrobials are often suitable candidates for oral BSI therapy. 
Among 106 patients with GNR BSI treated with a highly bio-
available oral antibiotic (eg, levofloxacin), the treatment failure 
rate was only 2% (versus 14% when an antimicrobial with only 
moderate or low bioavailability was selected).15 Oral treatment 
of Enterobacteriaceae BSIs secondary to urinary tract infection 
has been best studied. A prospective randomized, controlled 
trial evaluated oral versus intravenous ciprofloxacin amongst 
141 patients with severe pyelonephritis or complicated urinary 
tract infections, in which the rate of bacteremia was 38%.16 No-
tably, patients with obstruction or renal abscess were exclud-
ed from the trial. No significant differences in microbiological 
failure or unsatisfactory clinical responses were found between 
the IV and oral treatment groups. Additionally, a Cochrane re-
view reported that oral antibiotic therapy is no less effective 
than intravenous therapy for severe UTI, although data on BSI 
frequency were not provided.17
Resistance to fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin has 
been identified as a risk factor for GNR BSI oral treatment fail-
ure, highlighting the importance of confirming susceptibilities 
before committing to an oral treatment plan.18,19 Even ESBL 
Enterobacteriaceae can be considered for treatment with fluo-
roquinolones if susceptibilities allow.20
The ideal duration of therapy for GNR BSI is an area of active 
research. A recent retrospective trial showed no difference in 
all-cause mortality or recurrent BSI in GNR BSI treated for 8 
versus 15 days.21 A recent meta-analysis suggested that 7 days 
of therapy was noninferior to a longer duration therapy (10–14 
days) for pyelonephritis, in which a subset was bacteremic.22 
However, another trial reported that short course therapy for 
GNR BSI (<7 days) is associated with higher risk of treatment 
failure.22 Further data are needed.
Gram-Negative Rods, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen, intrinsical-
ly resistant to many antimicrobials, and readily develops an-
timicrobial resistance during therapy. Fluoroquinolones (such 
as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and delafloxacin) are the only 
currently available oral agents with antipseudomonal activity. 
However, fluoroquinolones may not achieve blood concen-
trations appropriate for P
. aeruginosa treatment at standard 
doses, while higher dose regimens may be associated with 
increased risk for undesirable side effects.24,25 Currently, giv-
en the minimal trial data comparing oral versus intravenous 
therapy for P
. aeruginosa BSIs, and multiple studies indicating 
increased mortality when P
. aeruginosa is treated inappropri-
ately,26,27 we prefer a conservative approach and consider oral 
therapy a less-preferred option.
EVIDENCE REGARDING BLOODSTREAM  
INFECTIONS DUE TO GRAM-POSITIVE COCCI 
The majority of bloodstream infections in the United States, 
and the resultant morbidity and mortality, are from gram-pos-
itive cocci (GPCs) such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and 
Enterococcus species.1
Gram-Positive Cocci, Streptococcus pneumoniae
Of the approximately 900,000 annual cases of S. pneumoni-
ae infection in the United States, approximately 40,000 are 
complicated by BSI, with 70% of those cases being second-
ary to pneumococcal pneumonia.28 In studies on patients with 
pneumococcal pneumonia, bacteremic cases generally fare 
worse than those without bacteremia.29,30 However, several 
trials demonstrated comparable outcomes in the setting of 
bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia when switched early 
(within 3 days) from intravenous to oral antibiotics to complete 
a 7-day course.31,32 Before pneumococcal penicillin resistance 
became widespread, oral penicillin was shown to be effective, 
and remains an option for susceptible strains.33 It is worth not-
ing, however, that other trials have shown a mortality benefit 
from treating bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia initially 
with dual-therapy including a β-lactam and macrolide such 
as azithromycin. This observation highlights the importance

of knowing the final susceptibility data prior to consolidating 
to monotherapy with an oral agent, and that macrolides may 
have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, though further re-
search is needed.34,35
Although the evidence for treating bacteremic pneumococ-
cal pneumonia using a highly active and absorbable oral agent 
is fairly robust, S. pneumoniae BSI secondary to other sites of 
infection sites is less well studied and may require a more con-
servative approach.
Gram-Positive Cocci, β-hemolytic Streptococcus 
species
β-Hemolytic Streptococci include groups A to H, of which 
groups A (S. pyogenes) and B (S. agalactiae) are the most 
commonly implicated in BSIs.36 Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
is classically associated with streptococcal pharyngitis and 
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is associated with postpartum 
endometritis and neonatal meningitis, though both are vir-
ulent organisms with a potential to cause invasive infection 
throughout the body and in all age-groups. Up to 14% of GAS 
and 41% GBS BSIs have no clear source;37,38 given these are 
skin pathogens, such scenarios likely represent invasion via 
microabrasion. As β-hemolytic streptococcal BSI is often ob-
served in the context of necrotizing skin and soft tissue infec-
tions, surgical source control is particularly important.39 GAS 
remains exquisitely susceptible to penicillin, and intravenous 
penicillin remains the mainstay for invasive disease; GBS has 
higher penicillin resistance rates than GAS.40 Clindamycin 
should be added when there is concern for severe disease or 
toxic shock.41 Unfortunately, oral penicillin is poorly bioavail-
able (approximately 50%), and there has been recent concern 
regarding inducible clindamycin resistance in GAS.42 Thus, oral 
penicillin V and/or clindamycin is a potentially risky strategy, 
with no clinical trials supporting this approach; however, they 
may be reasonable options in selected patients with source 
control and stable hemodynamics. Amoxicillin has high bio-
availability (85%) and may be effective; however, there is lack of 
supporting data. Highly bioavailable agents such as levofloxa-
cin and linezolid have GAS and GBS activity43 and might be ex-
pected to produce satisfactory outcomes. Because no clinical 
trials have compared these agents with intravenous therapy for 
BSI, caution is advised. Although bacteriostatic against Staph-
ylococcus, linezolid is bactericidal against Streptococcus.44 Flu-
oroquinolone resistance amongst β-hemolytic Streptococcus 
is rare (approximately 0.5%) but does occur.45
Gram-Positive Cocci, Staphylococcus Species
Staphylococcus species include S. aureus (including methicillin 
susceptible and resistant strains: MSSA and MRSA, respective-
ly) and coagulase-negative species, which include organisms 
such as S. epidermidis. S. aureus is the most common cause of 
BSI mortality in the United States,1 with mortality rates estimat-
ed at 20%–40% per episode.46 Infectious disease consultation 
has been associated with decreased mortality and is recom-
mended.47 The guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society 
of America for the treatment of MRSA recommend the use of 
parenteral agents for BSI.48 It is important to consider if a pa-
tient with S. aureus BSI has infective endocarditis.
Oral antibiotic therapy for S. aureus BSI is not currently 
standard practice. Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
(TMP-SMX) has favorable pharmacokinetics and case series of 
using it successfully for BSI exist,49 TMP-SMX showed inferior 
outcomes in a randomized trial comparing oral TMP-SMX with 
intravenous vancomycin in a series of 101 S. aureus infections.50 
This observation has been replicated.51 Data on doxycycline or 
clindamycin for S. aureus BSI are limited, and IDSA guidelines 
advise against their use in this setting because they are pre-
dominantly bacteriostatic.48 Linezolid has favorable pharmaco-
kinetics, with approximately 100% bioavailability, and S. aureus 
resistance to linezolid is rare.52 Several randomized trials have 
compared oral linezolid with intravenous vancomycin for S. au-
reus BSI; for instance, Stevens et al. randomized 460 patients 
with S. aureus infection (of whom 18% had BSI) to linezolid 
versus vancomycin and observed similar clinical cure rates.53 A 
pooled analysis showed oral linezolid was noninferior to van-
comycin specifically for S. aureus BSI.54 However, long-term 
use is often limited by hematologic toxicity, peripheral or optic 
neuropathy (which can be permanent), and induced serotonin 
syndrome. Additionally, linezolid is bacteriostatic, not bacteri-
cidal against S. aureus. Using oral linezolid as a first-line option 
for S. aureus BSI would not be recommended; however, it may 
be used as a second-line treatment option in selected cases. 
Tedizolid has similar pharmacokinetics and spectrum of activity 
with fewer side effects; however, clinical data on its use for S. 
aureus BSI are lacking.55 Fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin 
and the newer agent delafloxacin have activity against S. au-
reus, including MRSA, but on-treatment emergence of fluoro-
quinolone resistance is a concern, and data on delafloxacin for 
BSI are lacking.56,57 Older literature suggested the combination 
of ciprofloxacin and rifampin was effective against right-sided 
S. aureus endocarditis,58 and other oral fluoroquinolone-rifam-
ycin combinations have also been found to be effective59 How-
ever, this approach is currently not a standard therapy, nor is it 
widely used. Decisions on the duration of therapy for S. aureus 
BSI should be made in conjunction with an infectious diseases 
specialist; 14 days is currently regarded as a minimum.47,48
Published data regarding oral treatment of coagulase-nega-
tive Staphylococcus (CoNS) BSI are limited. Most CoNS bacte-
remia and up to 80% Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia 
represent blood culture contamination, though true infection 
from CoNS is not uncommon, particularly in patients with in-
dwelling catheters.60 An exception is the CoNS species Staph-
ylococcus lugdunensis, which is more virulent, and bacteremia 
with this organism usually warrants antibiotics. Oral antimi-
crobial therapy is currently not a standard treatment practice 
for CoNS BSI that is felt to represent true infection; however, 
linezolid has been successfully used in case series.61
Gram-Positive Cocci, Enterococcus
E. faecium and E. faecalis are commonly implicated in BSI.1 
Similar to S. aureus, infective endocarditis must be ruled out 
when treating enterococcus BSI; a scoring system has been

proposed to assist in deciding if such patients require echo-
cardiography.62 Intravenous ampicillin is a preferred, highly ef-
fective agent for enterococci treatment when the organism is 
susceptible.44 However, oral ampicillin has poor bioavailability 
(50%), and data for its use in BSI are lacking. For susceptible 
strains, amoxicillin has comparable efficacy for enterococci 
and enhanced bioavailability (85%); high dose oral amoxicillin 
could be considered, but there is minimal clinical trial data to 
support this approach. Fluoroquinolones exhibit only modest 
activity against enterococci and would be an inferior choice 
for BSI.63 Although often sensitive to oral tetracyclines, data 
on their use in enterococcal BSI are insufficient. Nitrofurantoin 
can be used for susceptible enterococcal urinary tract infec-
tion; however, it does not achieve high blood concentrations 
and should not be used for BSI.
There is significant data comparing oral linezolid with intra-
venous daptomycin for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) 
BSI. In a systematic review including 10 trials using 30-day all-
cause mortality as the primary outcome, patients treated with 
daptomycin demonstrated higher odds of death (OR 1.61, 
95% CI 1.08–2.40) compared with those treated with linezol-
id.64 However, more recent data suggested that higher dapto-
mycin doses than those used in these earlier trials resulted in 
improved VRE BSI outcomes.65 A subsequent study reported 
that VRE BSI treatment with linezolid is associated with signifi-
cantly higher treatment failure and mortality compared with 
daptomycin therapy.66 Further research is needed, but should 
the side-effect profile of linezolid be tolerable, it remains an 
effective option for oral treatment of enterococcal BSIs.

Anaerobic bacteria include Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyro-
monas, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, and 
Clostridium. Anaerobes account for approximately 4% of bac-
terial BSIs, and are often seen in the context of polymicrobial 
infection.67 Given that anaerobes are difficult to recover, and 
that antimicrobial resistance testing is more labor intensive, 
antibiotic therapy choices are often made empirically.67 Unfor-
tunately, antibiotic resistance amongst anaerobes is increas-
ing.68 However, metronidazole remains highly active against a 
majority of anaerobes, with only a handful of treatment failures 
reported,69 and has a highly favorable pharmacokinetic profile 
for oral treatment. Oral metronidazole remains an effective 
choice for many anaerobic BSIs. Considering the polymicrobial 
nature of many anaerobic infections, source control is import-
ant, and concomitant GNR infection must be ruled out before 
using metronidazole monotherapy.
Clindamycin has significant anaerobic activity, but Bacte-
roides resistance has increased significantly in recent years, 
as high as 26%-44%.70 Amoxicillin-clavulanate has good an-
aerobic coverage, but bioavailability of clavulanate is lim-
ited (50%), making it inferior for BSI. Bioavailability is also 
limited for cephalosporins with anaerobic activity, such as ce-
furoxime. Moxifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone with some anaer-
obic coverage and a good oral pharmacokinetic profile, but 
 
Bacteroides resistance can be as high as 50%, making it a risky 
empiric choice.68
CONCLUSIONS
Bacterial BSIs are common and result in significant morbidity 
and mortality, with high associated healthcare costs. Although 
BSIs are traditionally treated with intravenous antimicrobials, 
many BSIs can be safely and effectively cured using oral antibi-
otics. When appropriately selected, oral antibiotics offer lower 
costs, fewer side effects, promote antimicrobial stewardship, 
and are easier for patients. Ultimately, the decision to use oral 
versus intravenous antibiotics must consider the characteristics 
of the pathogen, patient, and drug.
