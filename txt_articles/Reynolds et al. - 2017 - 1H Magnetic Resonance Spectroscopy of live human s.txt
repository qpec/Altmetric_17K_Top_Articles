STUDY QUESTION: Can 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) be used to obtain information about the molecules and metabo-
lites in live human spermatozoa?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Percoll-based density gradient centrifugation (DGC) followed by a further two washing steps, yielded enough
sperm with minimal contamination (<0.01%) from seminal fluid to permit effective MRS which detected significant differences (P < 0.05) in
the choline/glycerophosphocholine (GPC), lipid and lactate regions of the 1H MRS spectrum between sperm in the pellet and those from the
40%/80% interface.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Current methods to examine sperm are either limited in their value (e.g. semen analysis) or are destruc-
tive (e.g. immunohistochemistry, sperm DNA testing). A few studies have previously used MRS to examine sperm, but these have either
looked at seminal plasma from men with different ejaculate qualities or at the molecules present in pooled samples of lyophilized sperm.
STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS: Sperm suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37°C were examined
by 1H MRS scanning using a 1H excitation-sculpting solvent suppression sequence after recovery from fresh ejaculates by one of three differ-
ent methods: (i) simple centrifugation; (ii) DGC with one wash; or (iii) DGC with two washes. In the case of DGC, sperm were collected
both from the pellet (‘80%’ sperm) and the 40/80 interface (‘40%’ sperm). Spectrum processing was carried out using custom Matlab scripts
to determine; the degree of seminal plasma/Percoll contamination, the minimum sperm concentration for 1H MRS detection and differences
between the 1H MRS spectra of ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: DGC with two washes minimized the 1H MRS peak intensity for both seminal plasma
and Percoll/PBS solution contamination while retaining sperm specific peaks. For the MRS scanner used in this study, the minimum sperm
concentration required to produce a choline/GPC 1H MRS peak greater than 3:1 signal to noise ratio (SNR) was estimated at ~3 × 106/ml.
The choline/GPC and lactate/lipid regions of the 1H spectrum were significantly different by two-way ANOVA analysis (P < 0.0001; n = 20).
ROC curve analysis of these region showed significant ability to distinguish between the two sperm populations: choline/GPC ROC AUC =
0.65–0.67, lactate/lipid ROC AUC = 0.86–0.87.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Only 3–4 semen samples were used to assess the efficacy of each sperm washing protocol
that were examined. The estimated minimum sperm concentration required for MRS is specific to the hardware used in our study and may
be different in other spectrometers. Spectrum binning is a low resolution analysis method that sums MRS peaks within a chemical shift range.
This can obscure the identity of which metabolite(s) are responsible for differences between sperm populations. Further work is required to
determine the relative contribution of somatic cells to the MRS spectrum from the ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: 1H MRS can provide information about the molecules present in live human sperm and
may therefore permit the study of the underlying functional biology or metabolomics of live sperm. Given the relatively low concentration of
sperm required to obtain a suitable MRS signal (~3 × 106/ml), this could be carried out on sperm from men with oligo-, astheno- or terato-
zoospermia. This may lead to the development of new diagnostic tests or ultimately novel treatments for male factor infertility.

Introduction
Poor sperm quality is a major barrier to conception and is thought to
contribute to 30–50% of cases of infertility in heterosexual couples
(Pacey, 2009). However, our knowledge of sperm dysfunction is lim-
ited and the value of current laboratory tests has been questioned
(Tomlinson, 2016). The techniques of semen analysis rely upon visual
identification of spermatozoa by microscopy to estimate sperm con-
centration and the proportion of sperm with progressive motility and
ideal morphology (WHO, 2010). However, although these techniques
have been subject to regular review, they remain largely similar to
those developed by Macleod (1956) and have advanced very little
since that time. To date, few adequate tests have been developed and
brought into routine clinical practice (De Jonge, 2012) and those that
have (e.g. sperm DNA damage testing) are typically destructive to
sperm. Therefore, there is a need for semen analysis to be comple-
mented with more specific sperm function tests that examine various
aspects of sperm biology and provide information about the etiology
that cause them to swim badly or have poor size and shape.
Metabolomic studies by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)
have been used in many biological systems to provide insight into func-
tional aspects of cell cultures, tissues and bio-fluids (Emwas et al.,
2013). For example, MRS has been used to examine the molecular
composition of seminal plasma (Lynch et al., 1994; Hamamah et al.,
1998; Sharma et al., 2001; Gupta et al., 2011a,b; Jayaraman et al.,
2014) and concluded that it might be possible to discriminate some
phenotypes of poor semen quality to a high degree of accuracy.
However, other studies in the turbot (Dreanno et al., 2000), goat
(Patel et al., 1998, 1999), boar (Marin et al., 2003), rhesus macaque
(Hung et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2009) and human (Paiva et al., 2015) have
each used MRS to examine sperm. But in each case the sperm were
prepared for MRS by a variety of methods to extract metabolites or
other cellular material for scanning, thereby killing them. For example,
in the study by Paiva et al. (2015) washed sperm from ejaculates with a
variety of phenotypes were subjected to a methanol extraction before
being lyophilized for MRS. While other analytical techniques have been
applied to the study of sperm (e.g. Mass Spectrometry (Paiva et al.,
2015) and Raman spectroscopy (Huser et al., 2009)), to our knowl-
edge no one has so far reported the use of MRS on samples of live
human sperm. Therefore, we hypothesized whether MRS could pro-
vide a non-destructive method to obtain additional functional and
quantitative information about live sperm metabolites and thereby
provide a potential avenue for the development of new diagnostic
tests or novel treatments for male factor infertility.
While there are a variety of different approaches to conduct MRS,
the 1H nucleus is preferred as it is ubiquitously abundant and provides
the best signal to noise per unit time. However, a multitude of reson-
ant peaks and a narrow chemical shift range can result in spectral over-
crowding, where individual peaks stack on top of one another masking
their true size and position. Moreover, any contamination from
biological fluids or material used in the preparation of samples for
scanning can exacerbate spectral ‘crowding’ of a sample, potentially
distorting the true concentration and obscuring peaks of interest.
Since sperm are ejaculated in seminal plasma, a major challenge is how
to obtain a sufficiently pure population of live sperm to examine meta-
bolic differences between them without contamination from seminal
plasma
or
sperm
preparation

used
to

them.
Consequently, the aim of this study is to address three questions:
(a) What sperm preparation methods are suitable to prepare live sperm
for 1H MRS analysis?; (b) What is the minimum concentration of sperm
required for 1H MRS analysis using a commonly available spectrometer?;
and (c) Are there differences in the 1H spectra from populations of
sperm recovered from density gradient centrifuge (DGC) that could
give important new biological information about their function?
Materials and Methods
Semen sample donation and analysis
For experiments to determine the best sperm washing method, semen
samples were obtained from healthy volunteers following 2–3 days of sex-
ual abstinence. All samples used in questions (a) and (b) were produced by
masturbation at home and collected into a sterile plastic container
(Sarstedt, Leicester, UK) before being delivered to the laboratory within
1 h. Upon arrival, an assessment of semen volume, sperm concentration
and motility was performed on each sample according to World Health
Organisation (WHO, 2010) methods. For some experiments, an add-
itional assessment of sperm motility was completed with version 5.0 of the
Sperm Class Analyzer (Microptic SL, Barcelona, Spain) using a Microtec
LM-2 Microscope (Mazurek Optical Services Ltd, Southam, UK) and a
Basler A312fc camera (Basler AG, Ahrensburg, Germany). In such cases,
3 μl of homogenous liquefied semen was placed in a Leja disposable count-
ing chamber (Leja Products, Nieuw Vennep, The Netherlands) and a total
of 500 sperm or five fields of view observed using a PLAN PH2 20x/0.40
infinite/0.17 objective lens to measure the proportion of progressive, non-
progressive and immotile sperm according to the standard definitions of
the software. All procedures for the recruitment of volunteers and the
delivery of samples were approved by the University of Sheffield Research
Ethics Committee (Ref: SMBRER293; Approved on 28.02.14) and all
volunteers gave informed written consent for their samples to be used for
the experiments described in this paper. Semen samples used to identify
possible differences in 1H MRS spectra between the different populations
of sperm recovered from DGC (question c) were obtained from men
attending the Andrology Laboratory (Jessop Wing, Sheffield Teaching
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK) for diagnostic semen ana-
lysis as part of infertility investigations. All samples were produced on-site
and men gave their consent for any remaining semen to be used in this
study once the routine semen analysis had been completed. Only those
samples with sperm concentration and motility above WHO (2010)
thresholds were used in these experiments and the assessment of sperm
concentration and sperm motility were determined as described above.
Ethical approval for this part of the study was given by the North of
Scotland Research Ethics Service (Reference: 16/NS/009) with clinical

Sperm preparation techniques
To obtain matched samples of (i) unprocessed semen; (ii) sperm-free sem-
inal plasma; and (iii) seminal plasma free populations of sperm, for 1H MRS,
three techniques of sperm preparation were used and described below.
See Fig. 1 for identification of sample fractions A–N.
Experiment 1: simple centrifugation
1 ml aliquots of each liquefied semen sample (Fraction A) were transferred
to a 15 ml centrifuge tube (Biologix, Dutscher Scientific Ltd, Brentwood,
UK) and centrifuged at 500 g for 15 min in a Sigma 3–16 K (SciQuip Ltd,
Wem, UK). After centrifugation, the (upper) seminal plasma supernatant
(Fraction C) was aspirated and transferred to a clean tube, whereas the
sperm pellet (Fraction B) was re-suspended in approximately 600 μl phos-
phate buffered saline (PBS). Aliquots of each fraction were then taken for
MRS analysis as described below.
Experiment 2: DGC
Density gradients were prepared by carefully layering 1.8 ml of a 40% (v/v)
isotonic solution of Percoll (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont,
UK) in phosphate buffer saline over 1.4 ml of an 80% (v/v) isotonic Percoll
in PBS solution as described in (Elder and Dale, 2000). To estimate the
amount of seminal plasma contamination in the washed sperm prepara-
tions 200 mM fumarate was added to each unprocessed semen sample
(a 1:4 dilution according to semen volume) to give a final concentration of
~50 mM. Fumarate was chosen as its single resonance at 6.51 ppm did not
overlap with other peaks in the semen spectrum. Since the addition of
fumarate increased the volume of the unprocessed semen sample by about
one-third, as well as changing its viscoelastic properties, sperm motility
was reassessed (as outlined above) after fumarate addition. To each
Percoll gradient, 1 ml of the semen-fumarate mixture (Fraction A) was
carefully layered on top of the gradient before being centrifuged at 300 g
for 20 mins. After centrifugation, the sperm recovered from the 40%/80%
interface (termed ‘40%’ sperm for the purposes of this paper) and the
sperm recovered from the pellet below the 80% Percoll (termed ‘80%’
sperm) were collected and transferred to separate tubes. PBS was added
to each recovered fraction, 1 in 4 diluted, and the sperm re-suspended,

 followed by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min. A sample from each of the
fractions through the washing process (Fractions A and D–H) were
retained for 1H MRS analysis in order to track the fumarate concentration
at each stage. The recovered ‘40%’ sperm (Fraction I) and ‘80%’ sperm
(Fraction J) were collected and re-suspended in 600 μl PBS and aliquots
taken for 1H MRS analysis as described below.
Experiment 3: DGC with an additional
centrifugation step
To assess the extent of seminal plasma and/or Percoll contamination in the
‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm populations recovered from the standard DGC
method (Experiment 2 outlined above), a series of further experiments
were performed in which an additional wash step was included (Fig. 1).
Briefly, ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm populations were recovered from the initial
40%/80% (v/v) Percoll Gradient as for Experiment 2 before being 1 in 4
diluted with PBS and centrifuged again at 500 g for 10 min. The supernatant
was aspirated and the pellets (Fractions I and J) were then re-suspended in
1.2 ml PBS after which 600 μl was taken for MRS analysis (400 μl used for
MRS sample, with the remainder used for sperm concentration and motility
measurements). The remaining 0.6 ml aliquot was re-centrifuged at 500 g
for 20 min, to recover as many sperm as possible. After this step, the super-
natants were aspirated and kept for 1H MRS analysis (Fractions K and L) and
the final pellets were re-suspended with PBS added to yield a final volume of
600 μl (Fractions M and N) before also being analyzed by 1H MRS.
Following sperm preparation by each of the above methods, sperm con-
centration and sperm motility was re-measured in each sample according
to WHO (2010) methods in order to calculate the efficiency of sperm
preparation or use the data in MRS analysis as described below.
MRS experiments
For each of the fractions recovered from the sperm washing steps illu-
strated in Fig. 1 a 350 μl aliquot was added to a 5 mm MRS tube (Norell,
Morganton, NC, USA) along with 20 μl of D2O (Sigma Aldrich, Gillingham,
UK). Sample tubes were kept at room temperature until they could be
scanned. All samples were scanned, in a random order, at 37°C, with up
to 10 min equilibration time, using a 9.4 T Bruker Avance III MRS spec-
trometer (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany), with a 5 mm
broadband observe probe. Each spectrum was acquired using a 1H water-
gate, excitation sculpting, solvent suppression sequence (Spectral Width =
20 ppm, Number of acquisitions = 1024, Acquisition Time = 0.5 s, Repeat
Time = 4 s, Time Domain Points = 8222). Each spectrum was acquired
and processed using Bruker Topspin v2.1 software to produce a phase and
baseline corrected spectrum. All spectra were referenced to the 1H lactate
signal at a frequency offset δ = 1.33 ppm.
Data analysis
Spectra were analyzed using custom Matlab scripts (Mathworks, Natick,
MA, USA). A noise region with no visible peaks was chosen between
10–11 ppm and all spectra were normalized so that the intensity here had
a median value of zero and an interquartile range (IQR) of 1. Spectra from
composite fractions (e.g. seminal plasma, Percoll or sperm) were then fit-
ted to a target spectrum to quantify the proportions of these in samples
(e.g. the proportion of seminal plasma in washed sperm). A spectral bin-
ning method was then used to split the spectrum into 0.04 ppm regions
which were integrated to yield a bin area. Estimates for amounts of a com-
ponent within a spectrum (e.g. amount of residual seminal plasma
(Fraction B) in washed sperm (Fraction C) in Experiment 1), were gener-
ated by dividing the sum of fitted spectrum bin integrals for the target spec-
trum by the same value for the spectrum being fitted. This is outlined in
more detail in the Supplementary Material provided.
Metabolite bin integrals were compared against measured sperm con-
centrations in 31 matched samples of ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm (Fractions I
and J) to determine which metabolite peaks correlated with number of
sperm. First, all spectra were normalized as above and binned at 0.04 ppm,
generating 193 bins in total after removing the bins associated with the
water peak between 4.5 and 5.2 ppm. A Pearson’s correlation coefficient
was calculated for each bin versus sperm concentration and spectral bins
with r2 > 0.25 and a significance P < 0.01 were considered to be metabol-
ite peaks from sperm. Bin locations containing a significant correlation
were then used to determine the minimum sperm concentration required
to yield an observable 1H MRS peak within each bin with a signal to noise
ratio (SNR) > 3:1 (see Supplementary Material for details).
Differences in 1H MRS spectra from ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm populations
were examined using the protocol detailed in Experiment 3 (Fractions M and
N, n = 20). Spectra were processed, normalized and binned at 0.04 ppm as
described above for metabolite bin integrals versus sperm concentration.
The binned spectral integrals were then normalized to sperm concentration
so that differences between ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm spectra could be com-
pared using a two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni multiple comparison test,
where P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Bin regions identified by the two-
way ANOVA as significantly different were then subject to a receiver oper-
ator curve (ROC) calculation to examine the specificity and sensitivity of the
bin to discriminate sperm from the ‘40%’ or ‘80%’ populations.
Data for progressive sperm motility and sperm concentration in matched
samples were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test using Matlab.
Statistical differences between multiple groups were tested in Matlab using a
Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric ANOVA test and a multi-comparison
Bonferroni post-hoc test with (P ≤ 0.05) used as the significance threshold.
All results are quoted as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated.
Results
Selection of sperm washing method
Experiment 1: simple centrifugation
Figure 2 shows representative 1H MRS spectrum for (i) unprocessed
semen (Fraction A); (ii) the sperm pellet (Fraction B); and (iii) seminal
plasma (Fraction C); obtained from a single semen sample processed
using the simple centrifugation method of sperm washing. Visually the
spectra obtained for sperm and seminal plasma were very similar to the
unprocessed semen and fitting the seminal plasma and sperm spectra to
the unprocessed semen spectrum estimated the relative proportions of
these components as 84 ± 9% and 10 ± 6%, respectively (sum of bin
integrals, n = 4 see Supplementary Material for method details and
example Supplementary Fig. S1). Conversely, a significant amount of
seminal plasma (Fraction C) was still present in the spectrum from
washed sperm (Fraction B): 91 ± 6% of the sperm spectrum (sum of bin
integrals, n = 4; see example Supplementary Fig. S2). Although this
method of sperm washing was successful at recovering sperm (retaining
46 ± 16% of the total sperm and 27 ± 5% of initial sperm progressive
motility of the unprocessed-ejaculate) it was clearly inadequate to pro-
duce a seminal plasma free populations of sperm for 1H MRS scanning.
Experiment 2: DGC
To obtain 1H MRS spectra from washed sperm with lower levels of
seminal plasma contamination DGC was performed. A 40%/80%
Percoll gradient diluted in PBS was used for the DGC and Fig. 3a
shows the typical spectra obtained from ‘40%’ sperm (Fraction I),
‘80%’ sperm (Fraction J), seminal plasma (Fraction D) and that

 obtained from a Percoll beads colloidal solution diluted in PBS. A visual
comparison of the spectra now clearly showed some distinct differ-
ences between ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm as well as between both sperm
populations and seminal plasma. The DGC method retained 20 ± 3%
of the sperm (total of ‘80%’ and ‘40%’ sperm) and 55 ± 14% of the
progressive motility (average for ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm) compared to
the initial values in unprocessed semen.
Although the DGC method using Percoll/PBS reduced the level of
seminal plasma present in the spectra obtained from the two sperm
populations, there was clearly more seminal plasma contamination in
the ‘40%’ sperm compared to the ‘80%’ (Fig. 3a). Therefore, to estimate
the amount of seminal plasma contamination, the fumarate peak was
integrated in each sperm and sperm wash spectra, Fractions A and D to
J, and normalized to its initial value in unprocessed semen. The concen-
tration of fumarate in the seminal plasma spectrum, Fraction C, was
50 ± 1 mM. Based on this value the concentration of choline and citrate,
two other major metabolites in semen, were estimated to be present at
37 ± 8 mM and 61 ± 21 mM, respectively. The mean fumarate integral
in the spectra from both ‘80%’ and ‘40%’ sperm populations was diluted
to 0.03 ± 0.01% and 0.15 ± 0.02% (n = 4), respectively, compared to
its starting value (Fig. 3b). This is equivalent to a dilution of seminal plas-
ma components of >600 for the ‘40%’ and >3000 for the ‘80%’ sperm
populations. Similarly, the peak for choline at 3.2 ppm (a major compo-
nent of seminal plasma and sperm, see below) was also integrated and
tracked through each stage of DGC and a smaller reduction in the cho-
line concentration in ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm (>55-fold and >100-fold,
respectively) was also observed (Fig. 3b). Notably, the concentration of
choline was greater in the spectrum from the two sperm populations,
rather than the spectrum for the ‘wash’ (Fractions G and H) suggesting
that it was associated with the sperm themselves.
To estimate the amount of seminal plasma found within the ‘40%’
and ‘80%’ sperm populations, the bin containing the fumarate peak in
the seminal plasma spectrum was scaled to the fumarate peak in the
sperm spectrum. This found 3.0 ± 0.9% of seminal plasma compo-
nents in ‘80%’ sperm compared to 15.6 ± 4.5% in ‘40%’ (sum of bin
integrals, n = 4). In addition, the MRS signal from 50% Percoll/PBS
solution was also fitted to each sperm spectrum to estimate its
remaining content and this showed that Percoll represented the larger
component in both sperm spectra; 60 ± 5% of the ‘40%’ sperm
(Fraction I, see example Supplementary Fig. S3) and 59 ± 11% of the
‘80%’ sperm (Fraction J, see example Supplementary Fig. S4).
Experiment 3: DGC with an additional centrifugation step
To further remove Percoll (and any other remnants of seminal plasma
from the sperm spectrum) an extra centrifugation step was added to
the sperm washing protocol. The spectra obtained from ‘40%’ and
‘80%’ sperm (Fractions M and N), along with the supernatant obtained
from the additional washing step (Fraction K for ‘40%’ sperm super-
natant and Fraction L for ‘80%’ sperm supernatant) are shown in Fig. 4.
Critically, following this method, the Percoll content of the ‘80%’ sperm
population was reduced from 60 ± 3% in the first washing step to
26 ± 1% in the second (sum of bin integrals, n = 3); similarly for ‘40%’
sperm the Percoll content was reduced from 60 ± 2% to 31 ± 1% (sum
of bin integrals, n = 3, see example Supplementary Fig. S5). Fitting a

 representative seminal plasma spectrum from Experiment 3 to ‘80%’
sperm (Fractions J and N) showed there was almost no change in sem-
inal plasma content 8.5 ± 4.6% and 6.5 ± 1.6%, respectively (sum of
bin integrals, n = 3). Conversely, for ‘40%’ sperm the additional washing
step reduced seminal plasma content from 17.5 ± 7.2% (Fraction I) to
4.9 ± 1.1% after washing (Fraction M, sum of bin integrals, n = 3, see
example Supplementary Fig. S6).
Experiment 3 recovered 30 ± 4% of the total sperm (from Fractions
I, J, M and N), with no difference between the number of recovered
sperm in the Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 centrifuge samples, both
15 ± 3%. Importantly the progressive motility was not significantly dif-
ferent between the two centrifugation steps (data not shown). With
respect to its original concentration in semen the proportion of sem-
inal plasma in ‘80%’ sperm was estimated to be 1/9100 (Fraction N,
mean, range 1/4700–1/50 000, sum of bin integrals, n = 3) and 1/
16 000 for ‘40%’ sperm (Fraction M, mean, range 1/7700–1/49 000,
sum of bin integrals, n = 3).
Sperm concentration required for MRS
To identify which metabolite peaks were associated with sperm, 31
matched 1H spectra were acquired from the ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm
populations (Fractions I and J), processed as outlined above, and bin
integrals (0.04 ppm width) correlated against the sperm concentration
in the MRS tube. For a range of sperm concentrations from 2.9 to
199 × 106/ml for the ‘80%’ sperm population, 21 correlations were
found with a coefficient of determination, r2, greater than 0.25 and sig-
nificance, P < 0.01 (see Fig. 5a and Supplementary Material for fitting
parameters and example plots of bin integral versus sperm concentra-
tion, Supplementary Fig. S7). Correlated bins included choline/glycer-
ophosphocholine
(GPC),
3.22–3.26 ppm,
as
well
as
citrate,
2.49–2.61 ppm and acetylcarnitine, 2.17 ppm. The sperm concentra-
tion range required to produce a peak with a SNR > 3:1 was from
2.9 × 106/ml for choline/GPC (the most intense peaks observed in
the spectrum) to 199 × 106/ml for a peak assigned as unsaturated ali-
phatic carbon chain (5.58–5.62 ppm). For the ‘40%’ sperm population
(with washed sperm concentrations from 7.0 to 220 × 106/ml), only
seven bin correlations were found (Fig. 5b). In ‘40%’ sperm populations
there was also a notable correlation between sperm concentration and
the choline/GPC peaks from 3.22 to 3.26 ppm. The lowest ‘40%’
sperm concentration was 7 × 106/ml and this was sufficient to produce
peaks for all the correlated bins with a SNR greater than 3:1. Using the
spectrum acquired at 7 × 106 sperm/ml the SNR was calculated for the
most intense peaks within each correlated bin chemical shift range.
These SNR values were then used to estimate the theoretical sperm
concentration that would produce a peak SNR of 3:1 within each corre-
lated bin range and this was found to be ~3 × 106/ml.
Comparison of 1H MRS spectra from ‘40%’
and ‘80%’ sperm
The ability of 1H MRS to discriminate between the ‘40%’ and ‘80%’
sperm recovered from DGC (Experiment 3) was tested by a two-way
ANOVA. This showed that there were statistically significant differ-
ences between the spectral bins (P < 0.0001), ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm
populations (P < 0.0001) as well as a significant interaction term

 between spectral bins and ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm populations (P <
0.0001). Applying a Bonferroni multivariate comparison to the data
identified six bins where metabolite integrals were significantly higher
in the ‘40%’ sperm compared to ‘80%’ sperm populations. These
were for chemical shift regions associated with lactate (1 bin,
1.32–1.36 ppm, P = 0.003), lipid peaks (2 bins, 1.24–1.32 ppm, P <
10−27) and choline/GPC (3 bins, 3.17–3.29 ppm, P < 10−11), see
Table I for mean ± SE values. The bin integrals from the identified sig-
nificant locations where then used to discriminate between ‘40%’ and
‘80%’ sperm populations by ROC analysis. This showed that lactate
and lipid peak regions were highly predictive of sperm population type
(AUC 0.86–0.87), see Fig. 6. The ROC for choline/GPC peaks
(3.17–3.29 ppm) were also significant but showed less predictive
power (AUC 0.65–0.67). A Student’s t-test found no significant differ-
ences between these populations in terms of sperm concentration or
progressive motility.
Discussion
The data presented in this paper are to the best of our knowledge the
first to show that it is possible to obtain 1H MRS spectra from live
human spermatozoa and that 1H MRS can be used to discriminated
between sperm in the ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ populations recovered from
ejaculates with normal sperm concentration and motility. However, to
obtain suitable spectra of sperm for 1H MRS analysis, three technical
challenges had to be overcome.
First it was necessary to be able to efficiently remove sperm from
seminal plasma. Since sperm represent a relatively minor component
of semen (estimated at 1–5% by volume, Mortimer (1994)) there is
the potential for MRS signals from molecules in seminal plasma to
dominate those obtained from sperm. To achieve this successfully,
three commonly used sperm washing techniques were used and it was
shown that DGC with an additional washing step (Experiment 3)
allowed MRS spectra of sperm to be obtained with a SNR > 3:1 with
minimal levels (<0.01%) of contamination from seminal fluid compo-
nents. Although sperm washing is ordinarily a relatively straightforward
procedure, this is a greater number of washing steps (and consequently
centrifugation steps) than is commonly used to prepare sperm for
assisted conception.
Second, for successful MRS of sperm, it was necessary to perform
sperm washing using media and reagents which themselves did not
contribute significantly to the 1H MRS signal. Commercial media and

 reagents commonly used in assisted conception for washing sperm
often contain molecules (e.g. glucose, lactate) added by the manufac-
turer, presumably to provide energy substrates for sperm during the
sperm preparation process. Initial experiments with commercially
available products proved unsuccessful as the additional media derived
components, which were visible on the 1H MRS spectra (data not
shown), obscured the sperm derived peaks to an unacceptable
degree. Therefore, PBS was chosen because it had been shown to be
sufficient to support human sperm viability (Amaral et al., 2011), in
addition to exhibiting only a single water 1H MRS peak that is removed
from the spectrum during data acquisition. However, for the gradient,
we chose Percoll (Pertoft et al., 1978) because it was relatively inex-
pensive and it could be successfully diluted with PBS to give the correct
40%/80% ratio for DGC. Despite this, we were still able to detect a
signal from Percoll in the spectra after washing, but this was reduced
to ≤26% for ‘80%’ sperm and ≤31% for the ‘40%’ sperm fractions
after the second centrifugation step of Experiment 3 (Fig. 4).
However, although Percoll was used successfully in assisted concep-
tion for many years, it is no longer licensed for human use
(see Mortimer (2000) for a discussion of this issue). Therefore, if we
were ever to develop MRS as a clinically relevant technique, where the
sperm might be used therapeutically after scanning, then an alternative
MRS silent compound would have to be sought or developed to pre-
pare the density gradients. However, for the purposes of this study,
the use of Percoll was sufficient to show that it is possible to wash
sperm for MRS analysis.
Third, it was necessary to find a washing method which provided
sufficient sperm for MRS scanning and which at the same time did not
have a deleterious effect on sperm viability/function. At the start of
these experiments, it was not at all clear whether sufficient live sperm
could be recovered from a single ejaculate to generate an MRS signal
of sufficient intensity. For example, in the experiments by Paiva et al.
(2015), pooled samples of identical ejaculate phenotypes containing
150 million sperm were lyophilized for MRS analysis. If the same num-
ber of live sperm were required for the approach followed in this
paper, then this would seriously undermine the clinical value of MRS as
it would only be possible to perform with ejaculates with very high
sperm counts. However, based on the work presented here we esti-
mate the minimum sperm concentration required to produce a 1H
MRS peak greater that 3:1 SNR (defined as the minimum acceptable
level in this study) is ~3 × 106/ml. Moreover, we conclude that the
additional washing step required to prepare sperm did not result in a
significant change in the sperm concentration and motility suggesting
that this is a reasonable step to take. As such, this may allow the
Figure 6 ROC curve analysis of 1H MRS spectrum identified as being significantly different between ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm populations by two-way
ANOVA. Six spectrum bins were found using two-way ANOVA (spectrum bins and sperm populations) in two distinct regions of the 1H MRS spec-
trum; choline/GPC (3.17–3.29 ppm), lactate (1.32–1.36 ppm) and lipid (1.24–1.32 ppm). The ability of each of these bins to discriminate between
sperm populations was analyzed using ROC curves; Panels (a)–(c) lactate/lipid region, Panels (d)–(e) choline/GPC.

 opportunity to use MRS to examine sperm from men with oligozoos-
permia as well as those with astheno- or teratozoospermia (and com-
binations of all three).
The MRS system used in these experiments was a 9.4 T magnet
with a broadband observe MRS probe. The scanning time of each
washed sperm sample was 1 h 17 min, therefore potentially making
this technology useful in future andrology practice. We envisage that
hardware improvements such as use of a higher magnetic field,
improved MRS probe detection coil geometry and cryo-cooled coils
and amplifiers would improve the sensitivity of detection further and
therefore potentially allow detection of MRS signals from lower sperm
concentrations. Furthermore, by employing specialized glass MRS
tubes, the absolute number of sperm needed for scanning could theor-
etically be reduced still further and permit the analysis of sperm
obtained from oligozoospermic men. Clinical MRI scanning of living
patients is restricted in the specific absorption rate of radio frequency
radiation (<4 W/kg), and, to a much lesser extent, magnetic field
exposure. We do not envisage sperm to be significantly affected by
strong magnetic fields or by the radio frequency waves transmitted by
the MRS
scanning
sequence used
(estimated
as
<1.2 W/kg).
However, this will need to be specifically investigated in future studies.
From the MRS data obtained in this study, we have identified some
of the major molecules present in spermatozoa. These include
choline/GPC, lipids and acetylcarnitine in one or both sperm popula-
tions recovered from DGC. Without specialist techniques, such as
multi-dimensional MRS or isotopic labeling strategies, MRS will typically
identify molecules of less than 10 000 Daltons (Clore and Gronenborn,
1997). Therefore, we assume that the spectra shown in this article
represent soluble molecules associated with cell signaling or metabol-
ism. However, until we have performed further studies, we need to be
cautious about their significance.
Statistical analyses of the 1H spectrum from ‘40%’ and ‘80%’ sperm
populations highlighted significant differences in lactate, lipid, choline
and GPC peaks that were greater in the ‘40%’ sperm population com-
pared ‘80%’. Phospholipids are a major component present in the out-
er cellular structure of sperm and lipid, choline and GPC identified
may be associated with this structure (Tavilani et al., 2007). Since the
‘40%’ sperm population generally has more morphological defects
(Aitken and West, 1990), the differences in spectra may reflect ultra-
structural differences in sperm structure (e.g. cytoplasmic droplets).
Indeed, these differences in sperm structure are likely to be the reason
sperm are separated by the DGC method. Other studies have found
significantly altered levels of fatty acids in pelleted sperm derived from
men diagnosed as normo- or asthenozoospermic, however, the nature
of the difference depends heavily on the specific fatty acid being com-
pared (Aksoy et al., 2006). The resolution used by the binning method,
0.04 ppm, does not differentiate the type of lipid and further work
would be required to elucidate the identity of individual fatty acids.
Increased lactate in ‘40%’ sperm may represent altered energy metabol-
ism via glycolysis in these sperm compared to those from the ‘80%’ frac-
tion and additional studies using 13C labeled tracer molecules could
highlight the relative importance of differing metabolic pathways in these
sperm populations. Overall, differences in these peaks may result from
metabolic differences between the two sperm populations and this may
give a useful insight into the pathology of sperm dysfunction.
Our study is not without criticism and has several limitations. First,
only three or four ejaculates were used to assess the efficacy of each
sperm washing protocol and only three methods of sperm washing
were examined. However, while other sperm washing methods are
available (e.g. swim-up) we chose to use DGC as this is commonly
used in assisted conception so that our results had the most relevance
to clinical practice. Second, we are aware that some of the MRS peaks
present in seminal plasma, or the supernatants of the sperm washing
steps, could be derived from dead or dying sperm with leaky plasma
membranes. For example, analysis of the supernatant recovered from
Experiment 3 sperm centrifugation step (Fractions K and L in Fig. 1)
revealed several metabolites, including choline, citrate and lactate.
While these may have been derived from seminal plasma carried
through the fractions, there is also the possibility that they have origi-
nated from sperm during the extra centrifuge step by either by active
transport or because of damage to the sperm during sperm washing.
Further studies are needed to quantify the extent to which soluble fac-
tors are exported from sperm. Third, we cannot exclude the possibil-
ity that some of the MRS peaks may be from somatic cells (e.g.
leukocytes and epithelial cells) and that these are differentially fractio-
nated by the DGC along with sperm. There were generally more non-
sperm cells in fraction ‘M’ compared to ‘N’ but our CASA analysis
shows that this was typically ≤2% (i.e. ≤2 non-sperm cells per 100
sperm). The relationship between cell size, type, metabolism and MRS
spectrum is not straightforward and further work is required to deter-
mine the contribution non-sperm cells make to the sperm MRS spec-
trum and whether we have to take more account of this in future
experiments. Finally, the estimated minimum sperm concentration
required for MRS is specific to the hardware used in our study and
may be different in other spectrometers.
In conclusion, in this paper we show that 1H MRS can provide infor-
mation about the molecules present in live human sperm and we pro-
pose that this offers the opportunity to study their relative importance
and how they relate to sperm function. This may in turn lead to the
development of new diagnostic tests or ultimately novel treatments
for male factor infertility.
