The HIV pandemic continues to impose enormous morbidity,
mortality, and economic burdens across the globe. Simultaneously,
innovations in antiretroviral therapy, diagnostic approaches, and
vaccine development are providing novel tools for treatment-
as-prevention and prophylaxis. We developed a mathematical model
to evaluate the added benefit of an HIV vaccine in the context of
goals to increase rates of diagnosis, treatment, and viral suppression
in 127 countries. Under status quo interventions, we predict a
median of 49 million [first and third quartiles 44M, 58M] incident
cases globally from 2015 to 2035. Achieving the Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS 95–95–95 target was estimated to avert
25 million [20M, 33M] of these new infections, and an additional
6.3 million [4.8M, 8.7M] reduction was projected with the 2020 in-
troduction of a 50%-efficacy vaccine gradually scaled up to 70%
coverage. This added benefit of prevention through vaccination
motivates imminent and ongoing clinical trials of viable candidates
to realize the goal of HIV control.
HIV | vaccination | mathematical model | effectiveness
D
espite decades of treatment innovations, HIV remains a
significant cause of morbidity and mortality because of low
rates of testing and variable linkage to care (1–3). In 2013, the
Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estab-
lished a three-part global target for 2020 (4): diagnosing 90% of all
people living with HIV (PLHIV), providing antiretroviral therapy
(ART) to 90% of those diagnosed, and achieving viral suppression
from adherence to a responsive ART regimen in 90% of those
treated (4). This 90–90–90 target corresponds to 81% of PLHIV
on ART and 73% of PLHIV virally suppressed worldwide.
UNAIDS then extended their goal (5) to 95–95–95 by 2030,
compared with the overall global status quo of 53–75–77,
amounting to viral suppression among only 31% of PLHIV (6).
Underlying this global average is considerable variation among
countries. For example, Botswana, currently at 22% prevalence,
reports 80–97–90 (7), whereas neighboring South Africa has
similar prevalence (19%) but reports 57–84–71 (8). Among de-
veloped countries, Australia achieves the greatest proportion of
PLHIV virally suppressed, with rates of 90–99–93, whereas the
United States ranks 50th with its attainment of only 87–52–82 (8).
The last few years have witnessed promising advances in the
development of HIV vaccines and several candidates are under
investigation. For example, the phase III RV144 trial in Thailand
of an ALVAC-HIV/gp120 regimen demonstrated efficacies of
60.5% after 1 y and 31.2% after 3.5 y among participants aged 18–
30 y, with vaccine doses administered at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24 (9).
Results of the HVTN 100 trial in South Africa, which used an
updated ALVAC-HIV/gp120 regimen, showed a more robust
immune response than RV144 in participants aged 18–40 (10).
Given the safety and immunogenicity demonstrated by HVTN
100, the HVTN 702 study was initiated in November 2016 to
determine vaccine efficacy in 14 sites across South Africa (11).
The trial is enrolling 18 to 35 y olds with vaccination scheduled at
months 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 (12). Other advances in research on HIV
vaccines have included candidates based on adenovirus vectors
(13). Motivated by strong preclinical scientific underpinnings (14),
three phase I/II trials have been initiated as part of the Ad26/
MVA/trimer gp140 program and an efficacy study is planned for
later in 2017 (15). In addition, investigation into the prophylactic
potential of broadly acting neutralizing antibodies has provided
preliminary evidence for enhanced viral clearance through immu-
notherapy (16). Likewise, at the frontier of vaccinology for myriad
other diseases, including malaria, TB, hookworm, and dengue, is the
development of partially efficacious vaccines (17–19). In cases where
vaccines may not alone be sufficient for disease elimination, they
may nonetheless be a component of disease control in combi-
nation with drug therapies. Here, we evaluate such vaccine-
linked chemotherapy approaches (20) for HIV.
Quantifying the levels of new and existing interventions that are
required to turn the tide on the HIV epidemic in each country is
fundamental to national and international policies. To evaluate the
impacts of achieving the UNAIDS targets and rolling out a partially
efficacious vaccine, both individually and in combination, we de-
veloped a model of HIV progression, transmission, and intervention
that we tailored to each of 127 countries that collectively harbor
more than 99% of PLHIV worldwide (Methods and SI Appendix).
Previous analyses that have considered the 90–90–90 targets in a
total of 45 countries have found them likely to be effective (7, 21–
23). Likewise, a hypothetical 70%-efficacy vaccine was predicted to
be effective in the 24 low- and middle-income countries considered
(24, 25). We further evaluated the 90–90–90 targets and HIV vac-
cination in 103 countries that have not been considered. Moreover,
the recent addition of the 95–95–95 target for 2030 has yet to be
evaluated beyond UNAIDS preliminary estimates (5). We fit our
Significance
Despite extraordinary advances in the treatment of HIV, the
global pandemic has yet to be reversed. We developed a
mathematical model for 127 countries to evaluate Joint United
Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) targets for expanding
diagnosis and treatment of the infected, and partially effica-
cious HIV vaccination. Under the current levels of diagnosis and
treatment, we estimated 49 million new HIV cases globally
from 2015 to 2035. Achieving the ambitious UNAIDS target is
predicted to avert 25 million of these new infections, with an
additional 6.3 million averted by the 2020 introduction of a
50%-efficacy vaccine. Our study provides country-specific im-
pacts of a partially effective HIV vaccine and demonstrates its
importance to the elimination of HIV transmission globally.

 model to country-specific estimates of HIV incidence, prevalence,
and progress toward the UNAIDS targets (SI Appendix), also taking
into account the effects of treatment on both improving survival and
reducing transmission. For each country, we then projected the ep-
idemiological trajectories to 2035 of new infections, incidence,
PLHIV, and HIV-related mortality under status quo interventions,
compared with the UNAIDS targets. To quantify the potential ef-
fectiveness of HIV vaccination, we considered a base-case rollout of
a 50%-efficacy vaccine initiated in 2020, with scale up of 25% cov-
erage annually to a maximum of 70% coverage. Through scenario
analysis, we also assessed alternative efficacies of 30% and 70%,
maximum coverages of 50% and 90%, initiation in 2025, and more
gradual scale up at 10% coverage annually. Our results demonstrate
the substantial added benefit of vaccination in reversing the pan-
demic, irrespective of whether the highly optimistic UNAIDS targets
are met.
Global Projections
Under status quo rates of diagnosis and treatment, our model pro-
jects a median of 49 million [first and third quartiles 44M, 58M] new
infections globally (Figs. 1 and 2, and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Our
projections indicate that the 90–90–90 target could avert 22 million
[17M, 29M] of these infections, whereas the 95–95–95 target could
avert a further 3.3 million [2.8M, 3.8M] infections. By comparison,
vaccination alone is predicted to avert 17 million [15M, 23M] in-
fections beyond status quo interventions. Combining vaccination
with the 95–95–95 target would avert 31 million [26M, 39M]
infections.
Regional Projections
Underlying these global averages, there is regional variability that
arises from country-specific transmission rates and prevalence. Both
vaccination and UNAIDS targets averted the most infections in
Eastern and Southern Africa (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Fig. S11). In
this region, vaccination with status quo interventions averted
7.7 million [6.8M, 8.9M] infections, whereas vaccination combined
with the 95–95–95 target averted 14.2 million [12.2M, 16.6M] in-
fections. For the same strategy combinations in North America,
216,000 [197,000, 240,000] and 391,000 [345,000, 444,000] infections
were averted (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Fig. S8), respectively, although
this region is only 19% less populous than Eastern and Southern
Africa. The UNAIDS targets based on antiviral treatment affect the
number of PLHIV by prolonging survival (which increases PLHIV
compared with status quo) and by reducing transmission (which
decreases PLHIV). By contrast, vaccination averts new infections,
reducing PLHIV without the concomitant improvement in survival.
This transmission reduction achieved by vaccination is greater in
African regions that have a high incidence, including Swaziland,
Uganda, and South Africa, than in Asian countries with lower in-
cidence, such as India (Fig. 2).
Country-Level Projections
Viral suppression both increases the number of PLHIV by pro-
longing survival and reduces new PLHIV by lowering transmission.
The balance between these factors, and thus the overall impact of
UNAIDS targets on PLHIV varied (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Figs.
S4–S140). In countries with increasing per-capita incidence, such as
South Africa and Swaziland, the UNAIDS targets reduced PLHIV.
For example, the projected number of PLHIV in Swaziland under
the 90–90–90 target was 6% [-4%, 14%] lower, and under 95–95–
95 was 8% [-3%, 18%] lower compared with projections under
status quo interventions. Conversely, in countries where per-capita
incidence is already declining, such as United States and India, the
UNAIDS targets have a relatively greater benefit on improving
survival than reducing transmission, thereby increasing PLHIV. In
India, for instance, the predicted number of PLHIV was 54%
[48%, 59%] greater under 90–90–90 and 60% [53%, 67%] greater
under 95–95–95 compared with status quo projections. By contrast,
vaccination universally reduces PLHIV (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix,
Figs. S4–S140).
Even when status quo diagnosis, treatment, and viral suppression
are not improved, vaccination was able to reverse the trend of
increasing global incidence (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
Specifically, the rollout of a 50%-efficacy vaccine in 2020, with
scale up at 25% coverage annually to a maximum of 70% coverage,
was projected to reduce PLHIV by 36% [32%, 41%] and HIV-
related mortality by 11% [9%, 13%]. Combining vaccination with
the 95–95–95 target reduced PLHIV by 22% [12%, 34%] and
HIV-related mortality by 59% [57%, 62%], compared with pro-
jections under status quo interventions. This synergy was predicted
to be most substantial where UNAIDS targets are insufficient to
reverse the epidemiological trajectory, such as in Rwanda. None-
theless, even in the United States, where the 95–95–95 target re-
duced 2035 per-capita incidence by 55% [42%, 65%], the addition
of a 50%-efficacy vaccine achieved a 76% [69%, 81%] reduction.
Uncertainty Analysis of Vaccine Characteristics
Given uncertainty of the prospective vaccine profile, we simulated
model projections across a range of possible scenarios (Fig. 4).

taining status quo levels of diagnosis, treatment, and viral suppression

 averted from 18.7 million to 11.3 million. A slower scale-up of 10%
(compare 25%) annually averted a predicted 15.7 million infec-
tions, 3 million less than the base-case vaccination scenario. A
lower coverage of 50% (compare 70%) averted 14.7 million in-
fections, whereas a higher coverage of 90% averted 21.8 million
infections. Considering alternative efficacies, infections averted
ranged from 12.3 million with a conservative 30% efficacy to
24.0 million with an optimistic 70% efficacy, compared with
18.7 million with the base case of 50% efficacy.
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis regarding the epidemiological, clinical, behav-
ioral, and treatment parameters showed that predictions of vac-
cination effectiveness were more sensitive to the transmission rate,
acute progression rate, and transmissibility within and after the
acute phase than to the reduction in transmissibility during viral
suppression (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). By contrast, the effectiveness
of UNAIDS goals were more sensitive to transmission rate, rela-
tive transmissibility during viral suppression, and acute progres-
sion rate than to transmissibility within and after the acute phase.
The projected effectiveness of both vaccination and UNAIDS
goals were relatively insensitive to delay between ART initiation
and viral suppression, annual number of coital acts, and improved
survival due to viral suppression.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating country-level
and global intervention effectiveness. For example, in Rwanda,
where viral suppression is estimated at 74% of PLHIV, the 95–95–
95 UNAIDS target would avert 19% [14%, 25%] of new infections,
whereas vaccination alone would avert 33% [32%, 34%]. In South
Africa, where rates of viral suppression are substantially lower at
34%, the UNAIDS 95–95–95 target would avert 49% [41%, 55%]
of new infections, whereas vaccination alone would avert 31%
[31%, 32%]. That is, vaccination was projected to have 1.7 [1.4, 2.4]
times the impact of the 95–95–95 target in Rwanda and 0.6 [0.6,
0.8] times the impact in South Africa. Consequently, in Rwanda
and other countries already achieving high levels of viral suppres-
sion, the benefit of further improving treatment is limited, whereas
vaccination would be paramount for HIV elimination. Country-
specific PLHIV trends also have implications for estimating the
future morbidity and economic burdens of HIV in different re-
gions. Projections of growing numbers of PLHIV underscore the
urgency of expanding capacity to treat cardiovascular, cognitive,
and liver complications associated with long-term ART use, par-
ticularly in resource-limited settings.
The feasibility of achieving these UNAIDS goals is challenged by
interruptions across the HIV/AIDS treatment cascade (26, 27). For
example, civil unrest in Afghanistan and Yemen, and draconian
drug laws in Indonesia (28), have hampered diagnosis. Conversely,
other countries, including Malaysia, the United States, and India,
attain high diagnosis rates but struggle to engage people in treat-
ment, because of inadequate infrastructure and coordinated health
care or fear of stigma (29). Although the UNAIDS targets may be
more aspirational than practical (30), obstacles to vaccination will
likewise include its accessibility to at-risk populations, in addition to
the immunological challenges of developing an efficacious and du-
rable vaccine. Given the challenges inherent in treatment as pre-
vention and in vaccination, a combined approach would be the most
feasible and effective strategy to address the HIV pandemic in each
of the 127 countries considered.
To facilitate model fitting to a variety of countries, for many of
which only estimates of prevalence, incidence, as well as propor-
tions diagnosed, treated, and with viral suppression were available,

 simplifying assumptions were made. Although we did not consider
the vaccine waning exhibited by the RV144 candidate, the robust,
but imperfect, vaccine-mediated immune protection that we
modeled could correspond to a regime of boosters, as indeed has
been expanded in the HVTN 100 candidate protocol (10). The
vaccination and treatment-as-prevention approaches considered
here would be complementary to other HIV prevention modali-
ties, such as adult medical male circumcision (31), preexposure
prophylaxis (PrEP; ref. 32) and antibody-mediated protection
(33). The combination of these interventions is likely to have
synergistic effects on mitigating HIV transmission. Our findings
and modeling approaches may have conceptual applicability be-
yond HIV by showing the added benefits of partially protective
vaccines for other diseases when implemented in conjunction with
drug therapies. In general, rather than expecting vaccines with
perfect efficacy to replace existing drug therapies, a multifaceted
strategy that includes partially protective vaccines may nonetheless
be necessary to achieve elimination, as we demonstrated for HIV.
While we explicitly model the clinical stages of acute, chronic
without viral suppression, chronic with viral suppression, and AIDS,
we
did
not
incorporate
explicit
CD4
strata,
both
because
population-level data on CD4 counts are not available for most
countries and because CD4 levels are no longer pertinent as
thresholds for treatment decisions (34, 35). Similarly, given the lack
of estimates for most countries assessed regarding high-risk groups,
such as sex workers, people who share needles, men who have sex
with men, and prisoners, we did not incorporate risk-group strata.
Nevertheless, our fitting of transmission rates to each country will
subsume transmission within these risk groups. Targeting interven-
tions to high-risk groups would likely achieve greater effectiveness
for a lower overall population coverage. Therefore, the effectiveness
of the measures considered here would be conservative, particularly
for vaccination, relative to campaigns that integrated risk-group
targeting of intervention. Despite the simplifications, our projec-
tions of new infections, PLHIV, and HIV-related deaths are con-
sistent with other studies (22–24, 36, 37) of the 90–90–90 targets and
vaccination based on more complex models with CD4, age, and risk
strata for selected countries. Furthermore, model complexity limits
the broad applicability of a model. Consequently, previous studies
did not evaluate interventions in 103 of the 127 countries that we
considered.
Recent results from the HTVN 100 vaccine trial have bolstered
optimism for the development and deployment of an HIV vaccine
in the near term. HIV vaccination would enable a strategic shift
from reactive to proactive control, as suggested by our finding that
an HIV vaccine with even moderate efficacy rolled out in
2020 could avert 17 million [15M, 23M] new infections by 2035
relative to expectations under status quo interventions. While
overarching targets proposed by UNAIDS encourage global ef-
forts to meet shared goals, it will become increasingly important to
tailor control strategies at the country level. In many countries,
including the United States, Uganda, and Nigeria, the UNAIDS
goals, as ambitious as they are, would be insufficient to reverse the
growth of PLHIV without at least a partially efficacious vaccine.
Even in countries for which UNAIDS goals are sufficient to turn
the tide on the HIV epidemic, such as India, Tanzania, and
Ethiopia, vaccination would greatly accelerate elimination, sav-
ing millions of lives annually.

HIV infection into acute, chronic undiagnosed, chronic diagnosed, chronic
treated, chronic virally suppressed, and AIDS (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Viral

 only extends survival but also reduces transmission, both aspects of
which were incorporated into our model. Country-specific transmission rates
were fitted to estimates of the historical trajectories of incidence and preva-
lence, spanning from as early as 1990 for some countries. Simulations of our
model project the number of people in each HIV stratum from 2015 to 2035,
from which statistics such as prevalence and incidence were calculated. For
every scenario of intervention combinations, we conducted 1,000 model sim-
ulations, sampling values of model parameters from empirical distributions for
each simulation, and summarized the results with median and percentiles. See

the model.
