BACKGROUND
Myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythe-
mia, and myelofibrosis, are chronic hematologic cancers with varied progression 
rates. The genomic characterization of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms 
offers the potential for personalized diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment.
METHODS
We sequenced coding exons from 69 myeloid cancer genes in patients with myelo-
proliferative neoplasms, comprehensively annotating driver mutations and copy-
number changes. We developed a genomic classification for myeloproliferative 
neoplasms and multistage prognostic models for predicting outcomes in individual 
patients. Classification and prognostic models were validated in an external cohort.
RESULTS
A total of 2035 patients were included in the analysis. A total of 33 genes had 
driver mutations in at least 5 patients, with mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL being 
the sole abnormality in 45% of the patients. The numbers of driver mutations in-
creased with age and advanced disease. Driver mutations, germline polymor-
phisms, and demographic variables independently predicted whether patients re-
ceived a diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia as compared with polycythemia 
vera or a diagnosis of chronic-phase disease as compared with myelofibrosis. We 
defined eight genomic subgroups that showed distinct clinical phenotypes, includ-
ing blood counts, risk of leukemic transformation, and event-free survival. Inte-
grating 63 clinical and genomic variables, we created prognostic models capable 
of generating personally tailored predictions of clinical outcomes in patients with 
chronic-phase myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelofibrosis. The predicted and 
observed outcomes correlated well in internal cross-validation of a training cohort 
and in an independent external cohort. Even within individual categories of exist-
ing prognostic schemas, our models substantially improved predictive accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS
Comprehensive genomic characterization identified distinct genetic subgroups and 
provided a classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms on the basis of causal 
biologic mechanisms. Integration of genomic data with clinical variables enabled 
the personalized predictions of patients’ outcomes and may support the treatment 
of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. (Funded by the Wellcome Trust and

Classification and Prognosis in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
M
yeloproliferative neoplasms are 
clonal hematopoietic disorders compris-
ing polycythemia vera, which is charac-
terized by red-cell overproduction; essential throm-
bocythemia, which involves elevated platelet 
counts; and myelofibrosis, which is defined by 
bone marrow fibrosis.1 Polycythemia vera and 
essential thrombocythemia are chronic-phase my-
eloproliferative neoplasms, whereas myelofibrosis 
represents advanced disease that is diagnosed 
either initially or after the diagnosis of essential 
thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera. Current 
classification schemes distinguish among the sub-
types of myeloproliferative neoplasms according 
to clinical and laboratory features,2-5 but uncer-
tainty clouds where and how to draw dividing 
lines among them.6,7
Biologically, the development of myeloprolifer-
ative neoplasms is driven by mutations in JAK2, 
CALR, or MPL. Many patients have additional 
drivers that span a wide range of cancer genes, 
with patient-to-patient variation in the genetic 
and clonal landscape.8,9 Driver mutations correlate 
with phenotype and prognosis,10-12 and mutation 
order can also influence phenotype.13,14 This com-
plex genetic landscape probably contributes to 
heterogeneity in diagnostic features and outcomes 
in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.
In blood cancers, a progressive shift is under 
way, from clinical and morphologic classification 
schemes to those that are based on genomics.15 
Driver mutations are increasingly important in 
predicting clinical outcomes, but large, well-
characterized cohorts are necessary for accurate 
prognostic models.16 Studies have suggested that 
this promise extends to myeloproliferative neo-
plasms,10,17 but larger cohorts and comprehensive 
gene sequencing are needed in order to provide 
definitive answers.
Methods
Study Samples
We analyzed samples that were obtained from 
patients after they provided written informed 
consent and after ethics approval from relevant 
authorities was obtained. Details regarding the 
cohort, disease classification, and diagnostic re-
view are provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. Tumor DNA was derived from blood 
granulocytes, bone marrow mononuclear cells, 
or whole blood. The majority of patients did not 
have matched germline samples sequenced. We 
use the term “myelofibrosis” to encompass both 
primary myelofibrosis and myelofibrosis that 
evolved from essential thrombocythemia or poly-
cythemia vera.
No commercial support was involved in this 
study. See the Supplementary Appendix for de-
tails regarding patient cohorts and samples.
Sequencing and Analyses
We designed custom RNA baits to capture the 
full coding sequence of 69 genes, single-nucleo-
tide polymorphisms for copy number profiling, 
and germline loci that have been associated with 
myeloproliferative neoplasms (Tables S1 and S2 
in the Supplementary Appendix).18-20 Additional 
patients underwent whole-exome sequencing, as 
reported previously.8
Clinical Variables
Laboratory and clinical data from diagnosis were 
incorporated into prognostic models. The median 
duration between diagnosis and sample acquisi-
tion was 49 days. The median follow-up was 
93.8 months (range, <1 to 523) from diagnosis 
and 72.0 months (range, <1 to 360) from DNA 
sampling.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the timing of mutation acquisition 
using Bradley–Terry models of pairwise compari-
sons of clonal fractions.13 We used a Bayesian 
network analysis and Dirichlet processes to iden-
tify genetic associations and subgroups. Random-
effects Cox proportional-hazards multistate 
modeling was used for outcome predictions (see 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Results
Spectrum of Genomic Changes  
in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
Targeted sequencing for the full coding sequence 
of 69 genes and genomewide copy-number infor-
mation was undertaken in 1887 patients, and 148 
patients underwent whole-exome sequencing, as 
reported previously.8 The cohort of 2035 patients 
included 1321 patients with essential thrombo-
cythemia, 356 with polycythemia vera, 309 with 
myelofibrosis, and 49 with other diagnoses of 
myeloproliferative neoplasms (Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). A total of 33 genes 
had driver mutations in at least 5 patients (Fig. 1A,

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
and Tables S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Mutations in JAK2, MPL, and CALR ac-
counted for 1831 driver mutations and were the 
sole abnormality in 45% of the patients. A total 
of 1075 driver mutations were identified across 
other genes. Loss of heterozygosity was frequent 
for JAK2 V617F, especially in patients with poly-
cythemia vera, but was infrequent for CALR and 
MPL (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
We identified 45 truncating mutations in the 
terminal exon of PPM1D in 38 patients within 
the cohort (1.9%) (Fig. 1B); thus, PPM1D was the 
eighth most commonly mutated gene in myelo-
proliferative neoplasms. These mutations have also 
been detected in solid tumors, blood samples ob-
tained from healthy persons, and patients with 
breast or ovarian tumors, often after chemother-
apy.21,22 In our cohort, 10 patients had PPM1D 
mutations that were detectable only in a later 
sample obtained during treatment with hydroxy-
urea. However, PPM1D mutations were also de-
tected at or within 1 month after diagnosis in 20 
patients. Analysis of single-cell–derived hemato-
poietic colonies identified mutated PPM1D in a 
patient with triple-negative essential thrombocy-
themia (i.e., nonmutated JAK2, CALR, or MPL) but 
also identified mutated PPM1D that was sub-
clonal to JAK2 V617F in a patient with polycythe-
mia vera (Fig. 1C). These data confirm that 
PPM1D mutations can occur within the myelo-
proliferative neoplasm clone and be present at 
diagnosis; thus, their presence does not always 
indicate age-related clonal hematopoiesis or 
therapy-related disease evolution.
Mutations in MLL3 were detected in 20 patients 
(1.0%) and were predominantly nonsense or 
frameshift, as has been reported in patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia (Fig. 1A, and Table S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).23 Among these 20 
patients, 7 patients had triple-negative myelopro-
liferative neoplasms, which suggests that MLL3 
could be an important tumor-suppressor gene in 
these patients.
Whether mutations in JAK2 and MPL outside 
the known hot spots could be relevant to patients 
with myeloproliferative neoplasms has been un-
clear.24,25 We identified noncanonical variants in 
JAK2 and MPL in 16 patients with triple-negative 
essential thrombocythemia and in 1 patient with 
triple-negative myelofibrosis (Fig. 1D). Of these, 
three groups of variants were likely to be rele-
vant to disease pathogenesis: JAK2 R683G and 
JAK2 E627A in 2 patients with essential throm-
bocythemia (reported in acute lymphoblastic leu-
kemia in which they activate JAK226-28); JAK2 
R867 in 2 patients with essential thrombocythemia 
(associated with familial thrombocythemia29); 
and MPL S505N and MPL S204P in 4 and 5 pa-
tients, respectively, with essential thrombocythe-
mia.24 MPL S204P co-occurred with loss of hetero-
zygosity (LOH) at chromosome 1p, which suggests 
Figure 1 (facing page). Genomic Landscape  
of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms.
Panel A shows the frequency of recurrently mutated 
genes and chromosomal abnormalities in the cohort  
of 2035 patients. Mutations were stratified according 
to type (missense, nonsense, affecting a splice site,  
or other [e.g., stop, gain, or loss]). Insertions and dele-
tions (del) were categorized according to whether they 
resulted in a shift in the codon reading frame (by either 
1 or 2 base pairs [bp]) or were in frame. Chromosomes 
are indicated by Chr plus a numeral (e.g., Chr9 denotes 
chromosome 9). Chromosomal gains include whole-
chromosome gains (trisomy) and subchromosomal 
amplifications. Chromosomal losses include whole-
chromosome deletions (monosomy) and subchromo-
somal deletions. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was 
predominantly copy-number neutral, but in some cases, 
chromosome losses could not be ruled out. Panel B 
shows the site within the gene and protein consequence 
of PPM1D mutations. Colored shapes represent the 
characteristics of the patient who had the specific mu-
tation (shapes indicate the subtype of myeloproliferative 
neoplasm, and colors the phenotypic driver). A triple-
negative finding indicates nonmutated JAK2, CALR, 
and MPL. The term aa denotes amino acid, ET essen-
tial thrombocythemia, fs frameshift, MF myelofibrosis, 
PP2C protein phosphatase 2C domain, and PV poly-
cythemia vera. Panel C shows clonal structures of two 
patients with PPM1D mutations determined by geno-
typing of hematopoietic colonies derived from periph-
eral-blood mononuclear cells. Each circle represents a 
group of hematopoietic colonies that share the same 
genotype: wild type (white), other driver mutations 
(black), and PPM1D mutated (yellow). Wild-type colo-
nies are represented at the top of each diagram, with 
subsequent mutant subclones shown below. Somatic 
mutations acquired in each subclone are indicated be-
side respective nodes and represent those that were 
acquired in addition to mutations present in earlier sub-
clones. The term hom denotes homozygous. Panel D 
shows the site within the gene and protein consequence 
of noncanonical mutations of JAK2 and MPL. The V617F 
and exon 12 mutations in JAK2 and W515 mutations in 
MPL are not shown. Mutations highlighted in red are 
likely to be relevant to disease pathogenesis, with previ-
ous studies having shown somatic acquisition, familial 
inheritance, or functional consequences for the specific 
variants (see box of abbreviations). FERM denotes the 
4.1–ezrin–radixin–moesin domain, SH2 Src homology 2, 
Sig signal, and TM transmembrane.

a clonal advantage to acquired homozygosity for 
this variant.
Factors Influencing Classification  
into Disease Subtypes
Currently, patients with myeloproliferative neo-
plasms are classified as having essential throm-
bocythemia, polycythemia vera, or myelofibrosis 
on the basis of clinical and laboratory criteria,2-5 
but the biologic factors underlying these distinc-
tions are incompletely understood. The number 
of driver mutations per patient was higher in 
those with myelofibrosis than in those with 
polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia 
(Fig. 2A), as previously reported,8 and increased 
according to the age of the patient (Fig. 2B).
The distinction between JAK2 V617F–mutated 
essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera 
rests on whether the red-cell mass or hematocrit 
is elevated. We found that acquired driver muta-
tions correlated with hematologic variables (Fig. 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix) and were the 
strongest determinants of a patient with JAK2 
V617F–mutated chronic-phase disease receiving 
a diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia as com-
pared with polycythemia vera, although germline 
genetic background and demographic factors also 
contributed (Fig. 2C, and Fig. S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). LOH at chromosome 9p 
(9pLOH), causing JAK2 V617F homozygosity, or a 
high JAK2 V617F allele burden correlated with poly-
cythemia vera, as did mutated NFE2, a transcrip-
tion factor critical to erythroid differentiation.
Germline polymorphisms that have been asso-
ciated with red-cell variables in the general popu-
lation were distributed unevenly, with alleles as-
sociated with lower hemoglobin level and higher 
platelet counts being enriched in patients with 
essential thrombocythemia (Fig. 2C). Further-
more, the JAK2 46/1 haplotype, which is known 
to increase the predisposition to myeloprolifera-
tive neoplasms,18 correlated with polycythemia vera 
(odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.7 to 3.3; P 
= 
0.004), possibly through increasing 
odds of JAK2 V617F homozygosity by 9pLOH 
(odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.0 to 3.9; P<0.001). 
Older age and male sex also increased the odds 
of polycythemia vera. These data show that the 
location of any chronic-phase disease on the he-
moglobin and red-cell mass continuum is influ-
enced by many factors and that any arbitrary 
threshold to label patients’ disease as being one 
subtype or the other will not distinguish among 
patients with different underlying biologic factors.
Mutations in spliceosome components, epi-
genetic regulators, and the RAS pathway were 
strongly associated with accelerated phase (myelo-
fibrosis), as compared with chronic-phase dis-
ease (essential thrombocythemia or polycythe-
mia vera), as were male sex, older age, and 
germline loci associated with platelet count and 
red-cell variables (Fig. 2D).
The order in which mutations are acquired in 
myeloproliferative neoplasms has previously been 
shown to influence disease phenotype.1314 CALR 
and MPL mutations occurred more commonly 
early in disease, whereas mutations in NRAS, 
TP53, PPM1D, and NFE2 were acquired signifi-
cantly later in disease (Fig. 2E, and Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Some of the earlier-
occurring mutations in genes such as SF3B1 and 
Figure 2 (facing page). Factors Affecting Disease 
 
Classification at Presentation and Timing of Somatic 
Mutations.
Histograms show the frequency of driver mutations  
or chromosomal changes (gains, losses, or LOH) that 
were identified in different molecular subtypes of myelo-
proliferative neoplasm (MPN) (excluding 24 patients 
with >1 detectable phenotypic driver mutation) (Panel A) 
and according to the age of the patient at diagnosis 
(Panel B). Forest plots showing the associations between 
genetic or demographic features and presentation with 
essential thrombocythemia (ET) as compared with poly-
cythemia vera (PV) in patients with JAK2 V617F muta-
tions (Panel C) and the presentation in chronic-phase 
(CP) disease as compared with MF across patients with 
JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations (Panel D). Significant 
associations from univariate analyses after correction 
for multiple hypothesis testing are shown. P values 
were derived from logistic-regression modeling, identi-
fying independent associations. Causes of reductions 
in the hemoglobin (Hb) level, mean corpuscular hemo-
globin (MCH) level, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 
and platelet (Plt) count are indicated. Of 671 patients 
who had more than one somatic mutation, the order  
of mutation acquisition of at least one pair of mutations 
was determined in 271 patients (40%) (Panel E). These 
ordered pairings were used to determine the relative 
probabilities of a gene occurring first or second for a 
given pairing with the use of Bradley–Terry modeling, 
which provided an estimate of the overall timing of 
mutation acquisition. The horizontal axis shows the log 
odds of a gene occurring second in a gene pair. For ex-
ample, as compared with JAK2, PPM1D mutations have 
a log odds of 1.45 and therefore are e1.45, or 4.3, times 
more likely to occur second in the pair. Any pair of genes 
can be assessed in this manner by calculating the exponen-
tial of the difference in log odds for gene A and gene B. 
The error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

DNMT3A are also associated with age-related 
clonal hematopoiesis,30,31 which suggests that 
some myeloproliferative neoplasms could arise 
from an antecedent asymptomatic clone. In pa-
tients with multiple mutations, JAK2 V617F was 
more commonly a secondary event in patients 
with essential thrombocythemia and an earlier 
event in those with polycythemia vera or myelo-
fibrosis (Figs. S4 and S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix), a finding that confirms and general-
izes observations that had previously been shown 
for JAK2 relative to TET2 or DNMT3A.13,14
Genomic Subgroups in Myeloproliferative 
Neoplasms
Hematologic cancers may be subclassified accord-
ing to driver mutations that distinguish sub-
groups of patients,32,33,34 with the use of patterns 
of mutually exclusive or co-mutated genes. In our 
cohort, driver mutations showed complex patterns 
of assortment (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). We used Bayesian modeling to identify 
genomic subgroups of myeloproliferative neo-
plasms with maximum within-group similarity 
and maximum between-group discrimination.
We identified eight genomic subgroups in 
myeloproliferative neoplasms, defined according 
to simple rules (Fig. 3, and Fig. S7 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). TP53 mutations, often co-
occurring with aberrations at chromosome 17p, 
and deletions at chromosome 5q identified the 
first subgroup. TP53 mutations often occur later 
in disease (Fig. 2E) but dominate the genomic 
and clinical features of these patients regardless 
of the initial driver of the myeloproliferative 
neoplasm. As in patients with other blood can-
cers with TP53 mutations,32,35 these patients have 
a dismal prognosis with a high risk of transfor-
mation to acute myeloid leukemia (hazard ratio 
vs. the JAK2-heterozygous subgroup, 15.5; 95% 
CI, 7.5 to 31.4; P<0.001) and early death (hazard 
ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.6; P<0.001).
The second subgroup was defined by the 
presence of one or more mutations in 16 myeloid 
cancer genes, especially chromatin and spliceo-
some regulators, LOH at chromosome 4q, and 
aberrations in chromosomes 7 and 7q. This sub-
group was enriched for patients with myelofibro-
sis (odds ratio, 6.5; 95% CI, 4.9 to 8.7; P<0.001) 
and myelodysplastic–myeloproliferative neoplasms 
(including all seven patients with chronic myelo-
monocytic leukemia or atypical chronic myeloid 
leukemia) but also included 8.4% of patients 
with essential thrombocythemia and 11.5% of 
those with polycythemia vera. Patients were at 
increased risk for transformation to myelofibro-
sis (hazard ratio vs. the JAK2-heterozygous sub-
group, 5.4; 95% CI, 2.7 to 11.0; P<0.001) and 
shorter event-free survival, regardless of mye-
loproliferative neoplasm subtype or phenotypic 
driver mutation (hazard ratio for disease progres-
sion or death, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.1 to 3.2; P<0.001).
Patients who were not identified in the above 
two subgroups were classified according to their 
dominant myeloproliferative neoplasm pheno-
typic driver mutation. Patients with CALR muta-
tions, which co-occurred with LOH at chromo-
some 19p and with deletion at chromosome 20q, 
or those with MPL mutations all presented with 
essential thrombocythemia or myelofibrosis. Pa-
tients with MPL-mutated myelofibrosis had an 
elevated rate of acute myeloid leukemia transfor-
mation (hazard ratio vs. the JAK2-heterozygous 
subgroup, 8.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 49.1; P 
= 
0.02), but 
otherwise the two subgroups had a clinical 
course that was similar to that in the JAK2 sub-
groups. Patients with JAK2 V617F heterozygos-
ity constituted most of the patients with JAK2-
Figure 3 (facing page). Genomic Subgroups in MPN 
and Phenotypic Characteristics.
According to a Bayesian clustering algorithm (Dirichlet 
process), patients could be classified into six distinct 
subgroups on the basis of the presence or absence of 
mutations and chromosomal abnormalities. The remaining 
patients either had no detectable genomic changes or 
had clonal markers that were not defining for one of the 
six groups. The flowchart shows the logic that allows pa-
tients to be classified into the total of eight groups. Pro-
portions of patients with essential thrombocythemia 
(ET), polycythemia vera (PV), myelofibrosis (MF, either 
primary or after chronic-phase disease), or other MPN 
diagnoses are shown, as are rates of overall survival and 
myelofibrotic or leukemic transformation among patients 
in the individual subgroups. The 18 genetic aberrations 
involved EZH2, IDH1, IDH2, ASXL1, PHF6, CUX1, ZRSR2, 
SRSF2, U2AF1, KRAS, NRAS, GNAS, CBL, Chr7/7qLOH, 
Chr4qLOH, RUNX1, STAG2, and BCOR. Patients who had 
more than one mutation across JAK2, CALR, and MPL 
and deletion at chromosome 20q could belong to more 
than one classification. In patients who had myelopro-
liferation with other driver mutations, other diagnoses 
should be considered, depending on the nature of the 
genetic aberration. Chromo 
some 9pLOH was judged 
to be present if detectable at a 10% clonal fraction. 
The number of asterisks indicates the P value (*P<0.05, 
**P<0.01, and ***P<0.001) for the comparison with pa-
tients with MPN with heterozygous JAK2 mutation.

mutated essential thrombocythemia but also 
some of the patients with polycythemia vera or 
myelofibrosis; these patients had generally favor-
able outcomes. The subgroup of patients with 
JAK2 homozygosity was enriched for patients 
with NFE2 mutations and for patients with poly-
cythemia vera. Myelofibrosis transformations oc-
curred more frequently in this subgroup (hazard 
ratio vs. the JAK2-heterozygous subgroup, 3.0; 
95% CI, 1.3 to 6.6; P 
= 
0.007).
A seventh subgroup (36 patients [1.8%]) had 
identifiable driver mutations but none of the 
class-defining drivers identified above. This in-
cluded patients with mutations in genes such as 
TET2 and DNMT3A that are not disease-specific 
or with mutations in genes that have been as-
sociated with other myeloid cancers (such as KIT 
in systemic mastocytosis). The eighth subgroup 
(192 patients [9.4%]) had no detectable driver 
mutations and may have included patients with 
either reactive thrombocythemia or myeloprolif-
erative neoplasms with unidentified drivers. Pa-
tients were typically young and female and had 
received a diagnosis of essential thrombocythe-
mia. This subgroup had particularly benign out-
comes; only 1 patient (0.5%) had myelofibrosis 
transformation and 2 (1%) had acute myeloid 
leukemia transformation during a median follow-
up of 8.0 years (hazard ratio for disease progres-
sion or death vs. the JAK2-heterozygous subgroup, 
0.56; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.78; P 
= 
0.005).
We applied our proposed classification scheme 
to an external cohort of 270 patients with myelo-
proliferative neoplasms (137 patients with essential 
thrombocythemia, 14 with polycythemia vera, and 
119 with myelofibrosis) that had sufficient ge-
nomic characterization so that our flowchart 
could be applied. The subgroup proportions were 
similar in the two cohorts (Fig. S7 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Factors Influencing Disease Progression
A key determinant of the treatment of patients 
with myeloproliferative neoplasms is the predict-
ed prognosis. For example, patients who are ex-
pected to have a benign future clinical course 
would probably benefit from treatments that are 
aimed at minimizing thrombotic risk, and those 
who are expected to have progression to leuke-
mia or myelofibrotic bone marrow failure could 
be candidates for intensive therapy or clinical 
trials of new agents. We developed multivariate 
statistical models, incorporating 63 clinical and 
genomic variables, that estimated a patient’s prob-
ability of transition between stages of disease 
— namely, chronic-phase disease (essential throm-
bocythemia or polycythemia vera), advanced-
phase disease (myelofibrosis), acute myeloid leu-
kemia, and death.
We determined the fraction of explained varia-
tion for each outcome that was attributable to 
different prognostic factors (Fig. 4A). Death in 
Figure 4 (facing page). Modeling Outcome in Patients.
Panel A shows the transition states during a patient’s 
disease and the factors contributing to the risk of each 
transition. Patients may have presented with either 
chronic-phase disease (polycythemia vera, essential 
thrombocythemia, or unclassifiable MPN) or myelofi-
brosis (MF), as represented by the two central, rounded 
rectangles. The patient may have subsequently remained 
alive in these disease states or, alternatively, could have 
transitioned to one of four states: death in chronic-phase 
disease, death in MF, MF transformation of chronic-
phase disease, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) trans-
formation of either chronic-phase disease or MF. Individual 
models were created for each of these four disease-state 
transitions and combined into a  
single multistate model 
allowing for the prediction of probability of being in each 
disease state occurring at any time point in the future 
(up to 25 years after diagnosis), as calculated on an in-
dividual patient basis. Pie charts show the variables that 
contributed most to the predicted risk for each of the 
four transitions. These show the effect on disease tran-
sitions of both rare variables with a strong effect and 
common variables with a milder  
effect. Variables with 
a hazard ratio of more than 2.0 are shown in blue type. 
The numbers of patients with chronic-phase disease or 
MF are shown alongside the numbers of patients who 
transitioned to other states. Patients may have transi-
tioned more than once during their clinical course (e.g., 
from chronic-phase disease to MF and then to AML). 
The risk of AML transformation was highest among pa-
tients with MF. WCC denotes white-cell count; the arrows 
by the clinical variables indicate whether the value in-
creased (up arrow) or decreased (down arrow). Panel B 
shows the model predictions, as compared with the 
actual event-free survival (EFS), among patients. Com-
parisons of the actual EFS with the predicted EFS derived 
from multistate random-effects Cox proportional-hazards 
modeling for patients with chronic-phase disease and 
MF, for both the training cross-validation cohort and 
the external validation cohort, are shown. Each cohort 
was split into equally sized subgroups of patients, and 
each subgroup is represented by a data point plotted 
according to the observed and predicted EFS. Overall, 
the models show good correlation between predicted 
and actual outcomes for both the training and external 
validation cohorts at several time points (brown indi-
cates the EFS at 5 years, blue at 10 years, and red at 20 
years). The dashed line indicates points at which pre-
dicted outcomes perfectly match observed outcomes.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
the chronic phase was influenced predominantly 
by age, with genomic features having little pre-
dictive power — a finding that suggests that 
once cytoreduction has achieved adequate con-
trol of blood counts, causes of death are domi-
nated by those that would also occur in the gen-
eral population.36 These would, therefore, not be 
well predicted by the specific genomic features 
of the myeloproliferative neoplasm.
By contrast, genomic features played a sub-
stantial role in predicting progression from 
chronic-phase disease to myelofibrosis and to 
acute leukemia transformation (Fig. 4A). CALR 
mutations were independently associated with an 
increased risk of myelofibrotic transformation, 
as previously reported.37 Mutations in epigenetic 
regulators, splicing factors, and RAS signaling 
were all associated with myelofibrotic and leuke-
mic transformation — some of these associa-
tions have been identified previously.10-12 Whether 
mutations were clonal or subclonal had little 
effect on prognosis (see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Clinical features of the disease, such as 
anemia, splenomegaly, or thrombocytosis, still 
retained independent predictive power for trans-
formation events, which suggests that these vari-
ables reflect important features of the disease 
state that are not captured in the genomic land-
scape. Outcomes in patients with myelofibrosis 
did not significantly differ on the basis of 
whether the myelofibrosis was primary or oc-
curred after essential thrombocythemia or poly-
cythemia vera.
Personally Tailored Prognosis
Current prognostic models for myeloprolifera-
tive neoplasms, which are focused on myelofi-
brosis, use simple scoring systems and group 
patients into broad prognostic categories. Many 
factors influence clinical outcomes, with a wide 
range of effect sizes, which means that current 
schemes discard information that is relevant to 
prognosis. We explored whether our multivari-
ate, multistate prognostic models could generate 
accurate predictions for individual patients.
The usefulness of personally tailored predic-
tions can be assessed in two ways: do the predic-
tions usefully distinguish among patients ac-
cording to prognosis, and are the predictions 
more informative than conventional schemas? 
Regarding the first question, not only is our 
model able to generate a wide range of specific 
risk predictions (regarding long-term survival, 
death in chronic-phase disease, and myelofi-
brotic and leukemic transformation) but they 
correlate well with observed outcomes (Figs. 4B 
and 5, and Fig. S8 and Tables S6 and S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), both in cross-valida-
tion of an internal cohort and in an external 
validation cohort of 515 patients with myelopro-
liferative neoplasms (137 patients with essential 
thrombocythemia, 188 with polycythemia vera, 
and 190 with myelofibrosis).
Internal cross-validation showed concordanc-
es of 76 to 86% for overall survival, event-free 
Figure 5 (facing page). Personalized Predictions  
of Outcomes in Patients.
Panels A and B show example tiles that represent per-
sonalized predicted outcomes in individual patients. 
Panel A shows the predicted outcomes of a 79-year-old 
woman who presented with essential thrombocythemia 
(ET) with a hemoglobin level of 104 g per liter, a white-
cell count of 8400 per cubic millimeter, and a platelet 
count of 2,300,000 per cubic millimeter, and mutated 
CALR, SRSF2, and IDH2 along with LOH in chromosome 
18q. For such a patient presenting with chronic-phase 
(CP) disease (PV or ET), the model incorporates all 
clinical, demographic, laboratory, and genomic variables 
to predict the overall probabilities over time of being 
alive in CP, dying in CP, being alive in myelofibrosis (MF) 
after CP, dying in MF after CP, transitioning to AML from 
CP, and transitioning to AML from MF after CP. The vary-
ing probabilities of each of these transitions can be judged 
from the vertical axis and their respective Kaplan–Meier 
curves over a 25-year period shown along the horizontal 
axis. The black curve shows the predicted Kaplan–Meier 
curve of overall survival. This patient transitioned to MF 
and died within 5 years; this outcome is shown along the 
bottom of the plot, where the length of the horizontal 
black line shows the duration of follow-up and the cause 
of death is indicated by the shading of the circle. For  
a patient who presented with MF, as shown in Panel B, 
the same model predicts the probabilities of being alive 
in MF, dying in MF, and transitioning to AML over a peri-
od of 25 years. Panel B shows the predicted and actual 
outcomes of a 57-year-old man with MF who had a he-
moglobin level of 125 g per liter, a white-cell count of 
27,000 per cubic millimeter, and a platelet count of 
119,000 per cubic millimeter, and mutated TET2, ASXL1, 
CBL, and BCOR along with deletion in chromosomes 
7q and 11q. This patient died in MF within 2 years. All 
patients with chronic-phase disease or MF who had 
 
either a disease event (death or disease progression) 
or had more than 10 years of follow-up (>5 years for 
patients with MF) were ranked according to their over-
all predicted EFS. The predicted and actual outcomes 
for 40 individual patients with CP (Panel C) and MF 
(Panel D) showing how patients in the cohort may be 
distinguished in terms of EFS and cause of death.

survival, and transformation to acute leukemia 
as well as good performance on absolute predic-
tive accuracy (Fig. 4B, and Tables S6 and S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Concordances were 
similar in the external cohort, despite the fact 
that patients in the external cohort received diag-
noses at another center, were evaluated by differ-
ent pathologists who used different diagnostic 
criteria, and underwent sequencing at a different 
facility with the use of a different gene panel 
from the training cohort (Fig. 4B). Thus, the 
model provides considerable discriminatory power 
that accurately generalizes to other real-world 
cohorts. Owing to the existence of different di-
agnostic criteria, the model does not rely heavily 
on the exact classification label of the patient’s 
disease. Indeed, removing the distinction be-
tween polycythemia vera and essential thrombo-
cythemia, but simply retaining the distinction 
between myelofibrosis and chronic-phase disease, 
did not reduce the predictive accuracy of the 
model (Fig. S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Our model showed superior performance to 
current major prognostic schemas in clinical use, 
such as the International Prognostic Scoring 
System (IPSS),38 the Dynamic IPSS (DIPSS),39 the 
high molecular risk category for myelofibrosis,10 
and the International Prognostic Score for Essen-
tial Thrombocythemia score40 (Fig. S9 and Ta-
bles S6 and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Furthermore, we identified substantial heteroge-
neity in disease outcomes within individual prog-
nostic categories of current prognostic schemas 
(shown for DIPSS in Fig. S10 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix); this was especially prominent for 
intermediate-risk patients and allowed for more 
informative predictions in a group with other-
wise uncertain outcomes. This means that not 
so many patients need be screened before some 
emerge as having an increased risk of poor out-
comes; the numbers needed to test across differ-
ent scenarios are shown in Table S8 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix. The inclusion of mutations 
and chromosomal changes beyond JAK2, CALR, 
and MPL improved the predictive power of prog-
nostic models (Tables S6 and S7 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
We have implemented a free, user-friendly on-
line calculator of individualized patient outcomes 
(https://cancer

sanger

- 
multistage/ 
) that 
enables the exploration of data from patients in 
our cohort, and the generation of new patient 
predictions according to available clinical, labo-
ratory and genomic features. Further validation 
of our model with the use of additional cohorts 
of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms will 
be important, given the bias toward including 
patients with essential thrombocythemia in this 
study.
Discussion
A major challenge is how we use our under-
standing of the pathogenic complexity of myelo-
proliferative neoplasms to identify groups of pa-
tients with shared causative biologic factors of 
disease, such that existing and new therapies 
can be targeted to the most appropriate patients. 
Current classification of myeloproliferative neo-
plasms is hampered by disease heterogeneity 
within, and clinical overlap between, subtypes. 
A genomic classification has the virtue of iden-
tifying patients with shared causative biologic 
factors, is stable over time, and does not rely on 
blood-count thresholds for assigning particular 
disease labels.
Of the eight subgroups of myeloproliferative 
neoplasms identified, the subgroup with TP53 
mutations was genomically unstable and had 
poor outcomes; this same subgroup, with simi-
lar clinical implications, has been identified in 
acute myeloid leukemia and other hematologic 
cancers.32,35 Likewise, the subgroup of myelopro-
liferative neoplasms with mutations in genes 
regulating chromatin and RNA splicing is mir-
rored in both the myelodysplastic syndrome34 
and acute myeloid leukemia.32 Patients with myelo-
proliferative neoplasms in this group typically 
had myelofibrosis, although some had essential 
thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera, and 
shared a relatively poor prognosis (as seen in 
patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome or 
acute myeloid leukemia). This raises the possi-
bility that these driver mutations define a myeloid 
cancer in older patients that transcends tradi-
tional diagnostic categories.
Our model accurately identified a minority of 
patients with chronic-phase myeloproliferative 
neoplasms who were at substantial risk for dis-
ease progression. Such patients could be consid-
ered for clinical trials of new therapeutic agents, 
since they are the most likely to benefit and the 
trials would be more efficient if higher-risk pa-
tients are preferentially enrolled. Our model also

Classification and Prognosis in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
accurately identified the majority of patients 
with chronic-phase disease who seemingly had a 
benign outlook at diagnosis. In such patients, 
experimental therapy would be unnecessary, and 
a conservative treatment strategy that is based on 
cytoreduction and reduction of vascular risk will 
suffice to give long-term, event-free survival. 
Myeloproliferative neoplasms continue to evolve, 
however, and it would be informative to evaluate 
the opportunities offered by serial genomic pro-
filing to update treatment choices if high-risk 
genomic changes emerge or if therapy drives 
further evolution.
Comprehensive gene sequencing of patients 
with blood cancers is becoming increasingly ac-
cessible and routine. The integration of clinical 
data with diagnostic genome profiling may pro-
vide prognostic predictions that are personally 
tailored to individual patients. Regarding patients 
with myeloproliferative neoplasms, such informa-
tion will empower the clinician and support 
complex decisions around the choice and inten-
sity of therapy, recruitment into clinical trials, 
and long-term clinical outlook.
