BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Severely obese adolescents harbor numerous cardiovascular 
disease risk factors (CVD-RFs), which improve after metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). 
However, predictors of change in CVD-RFs among adolescents have not yet been reported.
METHODS: The Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study (NCT00474318) 
prospectively collected anthropometric and health status data on 242 adolescents 
undergoing MBS at 5 centers. Predictors of change in CVD-RFs (blood pressure, lipids, 
glucose homeostasis, and inflammation) 3 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and vertical 
sleeve gastrectomy were examined.
RESULTS: The mean (±SD) age of participants at baseline was 17 ± 1.6 years; 76% were 
girls, and 72% were white, with a median BMI of 51. Participants underwent Roux-
en-Y gastric bypass (n = 161), vertical sleeve gastrectomy (n = 67), or adjustable gastric 
banding (n = 14). Increasing weight loss was an independent predictor of normalization 
in dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure (EBP), hyperinsulinemia, diabetes, and elevated 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Older participants at time of surgery were less likely 
to resolve dyslipidemia compared with younger participants, whereas girls were more 
likely than boys to demonstrate improvements in EBP. Even those participants without 
frank dyslipidemia or EBP at baseline showed significant improvements in lipid and blood 
pressure values over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Numerous CVD-RFs improve among adolescents undergoing MBS. Increased 
weight loss, female sex, and younger age predict a higher probability of resolution of specific 
CVD-RFs. The elucidation of predictors of change in CVD-RFs may lead to refinements in 
patient selection and optimal timing of adolescent bariatric surgery designed to improve 
clinical outcomes.

What’s KnoWn on this subject: Severely obese 
adolescents, like adults, suffer from numerous 
comorbid health conditions. Bariatric surgery is safe 
and effective in severely obese adolescents and should 
be considered as a valid treatment of those in whom 
lifestyle interventions are not successful.
What this study adds: Analysis from the largest 
prospective study of adolescent bariatric surgery 
outcomes offers important insights regarding 
previously unknown predictors of change in 
cardiovascular risk factors, which may promote future 
refinements in patient selection and the optimization of 
the timing of surgery.

 Severe obesity threatens the health of 
4% to 7% of the pediatric population 
in the United States, 
1 
– 
3 as evidenced 
by data highlighting associations 
with increased prevalence of 
cardiovascular disease risk factors 
(CVD-RFs), including hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes 
along with evidence of associated 
end-organ damage.4– 
6 In conjunction 
with obesity-related disorders 
among adolescents with class 2 
obesity (BMI ≥120% of the 95th 
percentile) or higher, there has been 
a rise in the use of metabolic and/or 
bariatric surgery (MBS) as a primary 
therapeutic intervention. With a 
doubling of procedural prevalence 
since the early 2000s, researchers 
in US literature estimate that ∼1600 
adolescents undergo MBS annually.7 
In contrast with the large body of 
adult literature, studies in which 
researchers examine the predictors 
of changes in CVD-RFs among 
adolescents undergoing MBS are 
lacking and could be of value when 
considering the risk/benefit balance 
of surgical treatment.
To address these knowledge gaps, 
data from the Teen-Longitudinal 
Assessment of Bariatric Surgery 
(Teen-LABS) study were used to 
examine predictors of change in 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. 
We hypothesized that baseline 
characteristics (ie, age, sex, 
anthropomorphic measures, and 
ethnicity) may predict a differential 
response of CVD-RFs to adolescent 
MBS.
Methods
study design and subjects
Teen-LABS (NCT00465829) design 
and methodology have been 
previously described.8, 
 
9 By using 
consensus guidelines, consecutive 
adolescents (<19 years old and 
Tanner Stage 4 or higher) with class 
2 obesity or higher (BMI ≥35) and 
comorbid disease were considered 
eligible for MBS and study enrollment 
at 1 of 5 centers (February 28,  
2007–December 30, 2011).1, 
 
3, 
10 The 
study protocol, data- and safety-
monitoring plans, and assent and/or  
consent forms were approved by 
all institutional review boards and 
an independent data- and safety-
monitoring board.
collection of data
Baseline (≤30 days presurgery) and 
follow-up data were collected at 6 
months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, 
as described.5, 
 
9, 
 
11, 
 
12 The majority of 
postoperative research visits (89%) 
occurred at Teen-LABS centers, 
with 8% occurring in participants’ 
homes (by using field examiners) or 
by collection of self-reported data 
(3%) by using telephone interviews 
and/or electronic communication. 
Standard definitions were employed 
to determine the presence or 
absence of comorbidities by using 
participant interviews, physical 
examinations, medical record review, 
and laboratory results. Data were 
maintained in a central database at 
the data-coordinating center.
definitions
Previously reported definitions 
of the prevalence, remission, and 
incidence of CVD-RFs (dyslipidemia, 
elevated blood pressure [EBP], 
prehypertension, and type 2 
diabetes) were used and adjusted to 
account for each participant’s age 
during follow-up for CVD-RFs  
with age-specific cutpoints 
(adolescents versus adults).5, 
 
13 
Although potentially introducing 
bias, we decided to employ 
categorical analysis based on well-
established, age-dependent cutpoints 
to provide relevance to published 
clinical guidelines in the context of a 
cohort transitioning into adulthood. 
Also, this approach will assist in 
future analyses, at which time a 
full transition of the cohort into 
adulthood will be complete. CVD-RF 
remission rates were calculated 
as the percentage of participants 
(with evaluable data) who did not 
have the clinical condition at each

 postoperative time point among 
those with the condition at baseline. 
CVD-RF incidence was calculated as 
the percentage of participants with 
the condition at each postoperative 
visit among those without the 
baseline condition. Composite scoring 
(the CVD-RF total) was employed 
by using equally weighted CVD-RFs 
(EBP, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, 
and elevated high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]).5 
Participants were scored as having 
dyslipidemia if they had elevated 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) or fasting triglycerides, low 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL-C), or were using lipid-lowering 
medications. For participants <21 
years old, triglyceride ≥130 mg/dL,  
LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL, or high HDL-C 
<40 mg/dL were considered 
abnormal. For those >21 years old, 
triglyceride ≥200 mg/dL, LDL-C ≥160  
mg/dL, or HDL-C <40 mg/dL (men) 
and <50 mg/dL (women) were 
considered abnormal. Dyslipidemia 
remission for participants <21 years 
old was defined as triglyceride <130 
mg/dL, LDL-C <130 mg/dL, HDL-C ≥40 
 
mg/dL, and an absence of lipid-
lowering medications. Remission 
for participants >21 years old was 
defined as triglyceride <200 mg/dL,  
LDL-C <160 mg/dL, HDL-C ≥40 
mg/dL (men) or HDL-C ≥50 mg/dL 
(women), and an absence of lipid-
lowering medication. Abnormal 
thresholds for triglyceride–to–
HDL-C ratios were defined as ≥3.0 
for non-black and ≥2.5 for black 
participants.14– 
16 Average systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP) (≥2 separate 
measurements) were obtained by 
using a Welch Allyn Spot Vital Signs 
Monitor (4200B). EBP was defined 
as SBP or DBP ≥95th percentile 
for age, sex, and height for subjects 
<18 years old or SBP ≥140 mm Hg 
or DPB ≥90 mm Hg for those ≥18 
years old. Irrespective of age, EBP 
was assigned to those who were 
using antihypertensive medications.

 obtained at 1 occasion rather than 
multiple, separate occasions, the 
term hypertension is replaced by 
EBP. Normalization of EBP was 
defined as SBP and DBP within the 
defined normal range for age without 
antihypertensive medications. 
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG)  
was defined as glucose ≥100 mg/dL.  
Diabetes was defined by using 
self-reported diagnoses, medical 
record review, medication use for 
the treatment of diabetes (excluding 
metformin with a concomitant 
diagnosis of polycystic ovary 
syndrome), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 
≥6.5%, IFG ≥126 mg/dL, or 2-hour 
oral glucose tolerance test results 
≥200 mg/dL within 2 weeks before 
enrollment.17 Fasting insulin, HbA1c, 
and hs-CRP were abnormal at  
>17 µU/mL, ≥6.5%, and ≥0.3 mg/dL,  
respectively. The homeostasis 
model assessment insulin resistance 
(HOMA-IR) index was calculated  
as (glucose [mg/dL] × insulin  
[mg/dL])/405 and scored as abnormal 
on the basis of participant age (>18 
years or <18 years).18, 
 
19 HOMA-IR 
≥4 was considered abnormal for the 
pediatric population because this 
corresponds to the 85th percentile 
for lean adolescents on the basis 
of our previous unpublished data 
and correlates with cross-sectional 
studies in which HOMA-IR ≥4 
represents moderate insulin 
resistance.20, 
 
21 To account for the 
relative state of insulin resistance 
in the pediatric population, 
HOMA-IR ≥3, which is considered 
abnormal in adults, was used for 
participants ≥18 years old during 
longitudinal analysis.22 Participants 
with diabetes were excluded from 
homeostasis model assessment 
analysis. Subjects who were receiving 
exogenous insulin were excluded 
from the analysis of changes in 
insulin and the homeostasis model 
assessment. Remission of diabetes 
was defined as the absence of related 
medications and HbA1c <6.5% (or 
IFG <126 mg/dL if HbA1c wasn’t 
available). Laboratory values were 
measured centrally (Northwest Lipid 
Metabolism and Diabetes Research 
Laboratories, Seattle, WA).
statistical Methods
The baseline and longitudinal  
(6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 
years) prevalences of CVD-RFs 
were assessed by using percentages 
and frequencies and evaluated by 
using generalized linear mixed 
models. The weights of pregnant 
female participants (second or 
third trimester) and up to 6 months 
postpartum were set to missing

 (n = 3 at 1 year; n = 7 at 2 years; n = 
8 at 3 years). Generalized estimating 
equation models were performed 
while simultaneously accounting 
for independent variables of weight 
change percentage, age, sex, race, 
CVD-RF count, clinical site, and 
procedure consisting of Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical 
sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) only 
to evaluate associations between 
the remission of CVD-RF and 
each independent variable among 
participants with abnormal baseline 
levels. Modeling analyses employed 
a generalized estimating equation 
approach with Poisson distribution 
to obtain robust confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the relative risk (RR) 
estimates.23 The potential effects 
of baseline BMI were evaluated 
by categorizing participants into 
groups: Group 1 (BMI <50), Group 
2 (BMI ≥50–<60), and Group 3 
(BMI ≥60). Categories were chosen 
to ensure that each group had 
sufficient participants to optimize 
statistical analysis. Age was modeled 
continuously, whereas sex (male and 
female) and race (white or people of 
color) were modeled categorically. 
Linear mixed modeling was used to 
evaluate associations of baseline risk 
factor presence with postoperative 
blood pressure, triglycerides, 
and HDL-C values, adjusting for 
age at surgery, sex, race, surgical 
procedure, clinical center, and BMI. 
All analyses included variable data 
from all procedures consisting of 
RYGB, VSG, and adjustable gastric 
banding (AGB) with the exception 
of generalized estimating equation 
models as mentioned above, which 
did not include AGB. Missing data 
were addressed by using multivariate 
imputation by chained equations. 
Twenty imputed data sets were 
generated for use in multivariable 
modeling analyses. SAS Proc 
MiAnalyze (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, 
NC) was used to generate estimates 
from the multiple imputed data sets. 
Comparison modeling from imputed 
and nonimputed data did not indicate 
meaningful differences. Therefore, 
results represent the nonimputed 
data. Analyses were performed by 
using SAS version 9.4.

 VSG (n = 67) or AGB (n = 14). BMI 
declined by 27% at 3 years (28%, 
26%, and 8% for RYGB, VSG, and 
AGB, respectively; all P < .01).
changes in Markers of cVd Risk
In addition to BMI reduction, 
improvements were shown in SBP 
(−6 mm Hg), DBP (−5 mm Hg), 
triglyceride (−42 mg/dL), and HDL-C 
(15 mg/dL; Table 1). Baseline EBP 
was observed in 44% of participants, 
declining to 15% at 3 years (Table 2). 
Furthermore, EBP showed a higher 
prevalence among male versus 
female participants at baseline (63% 
male versus 37% female; P = .001) 
with a reduction to 31% and 10%  
(P = .002), respectively, by 3 years 
(data not shown). The baseline BMI  
range (ie, low, middle, and high)  
showed a significantly lower pre-
valence of EBP among participants in 
the low BMI range (<50; 30%) versus 
middle (50–59; 51%; P < .001)  
and high (≥60; 63%; P < .001), 
and this was age independent. The 
comparative prevalences at year 3 
were indistinguishable (15%, 18% 
and 14%, respectively). To determine 
if blood pressure was differentially 
affected in those with and without 
baseline EBP, the mean change in 
SBP and DBP was examined before 
and after MBS. Participants with 
baseline EBP demonstrated an 11 
mm Hg mean reduction in SBP by 6 
months with no demonstrable change 
thereafter, whereas no significant 
change was observed among 
participants without baseline EBP 
(Fig 1A). An analysis of DBP showed 
a similar pattern of early and durable 
reduction (−6 and −4 mm Hg, 
respectively) among those with 
and without baseline EBP (Fig 1B). 
These results suggest that maximal 
improvements in blood pressure 
are durable and occur shortly after 
MBS for participants with baseline 
EBP while also suggesting partial 
improvement among those with 
normal blood pressure (ie, DBP). In 
addition, 7 incident cases of EBP (4 
RYGB and 3 AGB) were identified at 3 
years among the 98 participants with 
available data who had not had the 
condition at baseline (4%; 95% CI, 
0–8; data not shown).
A major reduction in dyslipidemia 
was also observed, with 75% 
affected at baseline, declining to 
27% by 1 year and 29% by 3 years 
(Table 2). The primary drivers of 
improvement relate to changes in 
triglyceride and HDL-C (Table 1). 
Hypertriglyceridemia declined from 
41% to 11%, whereas abnormal 
HDL-C (<40 mg/dL) declined from 
64% to 15% (Table 2). Similar to 
improvements in blood pressure, 
a partial differentiation was 
observed between those with and 
without abnormal baseline lipid 
profiles (ie, triglyceride and HDL-C 
levels). Namely, participants with 
baseline hypertriglyceridemia 
(>130 mg/dL) experienced a 94 
mg/dL decline by 3 years (Fig 2A), 
whereas those without elevated 
baseline triglyceride showed no 
change. Furthermore, in contrast 
with the early but fixed changes in 
blood pressure, improvements in 
triglyceride levels among those with 
hypertriglyceridemia were observed 
for up to 1 year. A corresponding 
analysis of those with and without 
abnormal HDL-C (<40 mg/dL) 
showed similar changes by 3 years 
(15 and 16 mg/dL, respectively) 
with continuous improvement 
beyond the first postoperative year 
in both subgroups (Fig 2B). Of the 
59 participants without baseline 
dyslipidemia, data were available 
to define the 3-year status for 43 
of them. Five incident cases of 
dyslipidemia (11.6%) were observed 
(1 RYGB, 2 VSG, and 2 AGB). The 
main drivers for the incidence of 
dyslipidemia were related to a rise 
in LDL-C (1 VSG and 1 AGB) or 
triglyceride (1 VSG and 1 RYGB) or a 
reduction in HDL-C (1 AGB; data not 
shown).
Baseline diabetes was present in 
13% of participants with major

 (74%) dramatically improved by 
year 3 (4% and 20%, respectively). 
Additionally, insulin resistance 
(defined as elevated HOMA-IR) 
declined from 76% to 25%, whereas 
hs-CRP (a biomarker of low-grade 
systemic inflammation) declined 
from 75% at baseline to 26% at 3 
years.
The CVD-RF total score was used 
to determine the multiplicity of 
comorbid disease. At baseline, 97% 
of participants exhibited ≥1 CVD-RF, 
whereas at 3 years, less than half 
(48%) demonstrated similar CVD-RF 
multiplicity. Those with ≥3 baseline 
CVD-RFs (33%) decreased to 5% at 3 
years (P < .001; Fig 3).
Predictors of cVd Risk Remission
Multivariable logistic regression 
analysis was used to discern the 
predictors of CVD-RF remission 
and/or normalization after MBS. 
For every 10% increase in weight 
loss, participants were 24%, 11%, 
14%, 13%, and 19% more likely to 
achieve resolution of dyslipidemia, 
EBP, hyperinsulinemia, diabetes, 
and elevated hs-CRP, respectively 
(Fig 4). Increasing baseline age was 
independently associated with a 
lower likelihood of dyslipidemia 
remission (RR 0.93; CI 0.88–0.98). 
Female (RR 1.41; CI 1.10–1.80) 
and white (RR 1.26; CI 1.00–1.58) 
participants were more likely to 
achieve normalization of EBP versus 
male participants and participants of 
color.
discussion
Researchers in recent studies have 
concluded that severe obesity 
is extremely difficult to reverse, 
and outcomes from nonsurgical 
weight loss (ie, diet and exercise 
and behavior modification) 
are disappointing at best.24

Observations that cardiometabolic 
risk is established during childhood 
and worsens over time have led to an 
increased focus on MBS as a means to 
mitigate longitudinal adverse effects

31 In the current 
study, we report the predictors of 
change in CVD risk in a large cohort 
of adolescents undergoing MBS, 
thereby extending our previous 
findings describing the baseline 
prevalence of CVD-RFs within this 
same cohort.5, 
 
9 The current analysis 
shows that reductions in CVD-RFs are 
associated with not only weight loss 
but also age at the time of surgery, 
preoperative BMI, sex, and race.
The identification of the predictors 
of change in CVD-RFs is novel and 
important. We offer clear evidence 
that weight loss after adolescent MBS 
predicts the degree of longitudinal 
improvement in elevated hs-CRP, 
hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and 
diabetes. In addition, we demonstrate 
an important relationship between 
highest baseline BMI and decreased 
probability of hs-CRP normalization. 
In conjunction with data showing 
that adolescents in the highest 
BMI categories have a lower 
likelihood of achieving a normal 
postoperative BMI, 
32, 
 
33 these results 
are particularly relevant to patient 
selection for surgery. Specifically, the 
optimal time to perform MBS may be 
before individuals achieve BMI values 
that predict resistance to a reversal 
of obesity and reduced probability of 
improvement of certain CVD-RFs (ie, 
hs-CRP). Thus, the evidence suggests 
that better long-term outcomes may 
be anticipated among individuals 
undergoing MBS at lower BMI levels 
(ie, <50).
Although relationships between 
change in CVD-RFs and postoperative 
weight reduction are not unexpected, 
additional interactions should also be 
considered. Increasing age at the time 
of MBS was associated with a reduced 
likelihood of dyslipidemia remission 
and normalization of hs-CRP. These 
findings suggest that even within the 
narrow age range of this adolescent 
cohort, distinct advantages to 
undergoing MBS earlier may exist. 
Although earlier surgical intervention 
presents an attractive hypothesis 
that CVD-RFs and end-organ damage 
may be reduced, the ability to offer 
clear guidance regarding an ideal 
age is limited by a paucity of studies 
that specifically address this issue. 
Although recent reports show 
favorable outcomes among preteen-
aged and early-childhood cohorts, 
34, 
 
35  
high-quality data addressing the 
advantages and disadvantages of 
earlier surgery are lacking. Our 
findings underscore the importance 
of long-term analysis to demonstrate 
whether the more beneficial 
responses of CVD-RFs in younger 
adolescents and children allow these 
individuals to enjoy even greater 
longitudinal health benefits than 
individuals undergoing MBS later in 
adolescence.
LDL-C concentrations are associated 
with CVD development but do not 
tell the whole story and are not 
related to BMI in a purely linear 
fashion. Indeed, only 8% of our 
cohort had raised baseline LDL-C.34 
The LDL-C phenotype is influenced 
by central obesity, insulin resistance, 
glucose intolerance, and elevated 
triglycerides, and it is characterized 
by small, dense, apolipoprotein B–rich 
LDL-C particles, which are highly 
atherogenic.36, 
 
37 Thus, a reduction 
in LDL-C–related risk with weight 
loss likely reflects changes in factors 
associated with the atherogenic 
phenotype through the effect of 
MBS on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein 
kinetics rather than changes in 
concentration.38
Finally, the collective interpretation 
of the dramatic improvements in 
a number of CVD risk parameters, 
including IFG, insulin, hs-CRP, and 
EBP, as well as improvements 
in HOMA-IR, representing the 
normalization of cardiometabolic 
homeostasis, serves as 1 of the most 
powerful arguments in support 
of MBS in adolescents to date. In 
the context of data highlighting 
the adverse effects of untreated 
childhood obesity in adulthood29, 
 
30 
as well as evidence demonstrating 
the important mitigating influence 
of MBS on numerous CVD-RFs and 
related disease entities (ie, diabetes, 
EBP, and dyslipidemia) among 
adolescents13 and adults, 
39 the 
current report strongly supports 
the overall hypothesis that MBS 
performed during adolescence may 
provide unique benefits by altering 
the probability of future adverse 
cardiovascular events later in life, 
including the development and 
progression of impaired glucose 
metabolism, atherosclerosis, heart 
failure, and stroke.
This study has several limitations. 
Based on the high BMI range, the 
findings are not representative of the 
wider obese population but rather 
are specific to the severely obese. 
Furthermore, the overrepresentation 
of girls, white people, and 
participants undergoing RYGB 
further limit the generalizability,  
and the use of categorical analysis 
based on the differentiation of  
age-dependent CVD-RF cutpoints may 
also introduce bias. Also, abnormal 
blood pressure measurements 
did not meet the strict definition 
of hypertension, thereby limiting 
our ability to compare outcomes to 
corresponding literature. Finally, 
because the analysis does not 
consider data beyond 3 years, our 
ability gain insight(s) related to 
weight loss durability, weight regain, 
and predictive analysis of incidence 
or re-emergence of CVDRFs remains 
beyond the scope of this study and 
will be the focus of future reporting. 
Despite these limitations, the large 
sample size and uniformity of data 
collection (including the use of a 
central laboratory, standardized 
definitions, and high subject 
retention) are clear strengths of this 
study.
