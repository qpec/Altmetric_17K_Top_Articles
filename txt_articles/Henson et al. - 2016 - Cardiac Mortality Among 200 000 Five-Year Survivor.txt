BACKGROUND: Survivors of teenage and young adult cancer are 
acknowledged as understudied. Little is known about their long-term 
adverse health risks, particularly of cardiac disease that is increased in 
other cancer populations where cardiotoxic treatments have been used.
METHODS: The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study cohort 
comprises 200 
945 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed at 15 to 39 
years of age in England and Wales from 1971 to 2006, and followed to 
2014. Standardized mortality ratios, absolute excess risks, and cumulative 
risks were calculated.
RESULTS: Two thousand sixteen survivors died of cardiac disease. For 
all cancers combined, the standardized mortality ratios for all cardiac 
diseases combined was greatest for individuals diagnosed at 15 to 
19 years of age (4.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.4–5.2) decreasing to 
1.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.1–1.3) for individuals aged 35 to 39 
years (2P for trend <0.0001). Similar patterns were observed for both 
standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess risks for ischemic heart 
disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy. Survivors of Hodgkin 
lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia, genitourinary cancers other than 
bladder cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, leukaemia other 
than acute myeloid, central nervous system tumour, cervical cancer, and 
breast cancer experienced 3.8, 2.7, 2.0, 1.7, 1.7, 1.6, 1.4, 1.3 and 1.2 
times the number of cardiac deaths expected from the general population, 
respectively.  Among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma aged over 60 years, 
almost 30% of the total excess number of deaths observed were due to 
heart disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This study of over 200 
000 cancer survivors shows that 
age at cancer diagnosis was critical in determining subsequent cardiac 
mortality risk. For the first time, risk estimates of cardiac death after 
each cancer diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 39 years have been 
derived from a large population-based cohort with prolonged follow-up. 
The evidence here provides an initial basis for developing evidence-based 
follow-up guidelines.

s
urvivors of cancer diagnosed in teenagers or 
young adults are internationally acknowledged as 
an understudied population.1 The majority of sur-
vivorship research has focused on survivors of specific 
cancers of adulthood or on childhood cancers.2–4 Find-
ings from studies of adult or childhood cancer survivor 
populations may not necessarily be directly extrapolated 
to teenagers and young adults because the tumors di-
agnosed are distinct in terms of the types of cancers di-
agnosed, hormonal factors (eg, puberty), tumor biology, 
and the developmental maturity of the organs at highest 
risk of toxicity.5–8 The historical and ongoing paucity of 
generally accepted teenage and young adult (TYA) can-
cer treatment protocols means that individuals may have 
received either adult or pediatric treatment protocols, 
which may be very different in their approach and treat-
ment intensity depending on the cancer type, treatment 
center, and clinician responsible for their care. Thus, it is 
necessary to assess TYA cancer survivors as a distinct 
group.
Cardiac disease has been found to be the leading 
cause of treatment-related nonneoplastic death among 
survivors of childhood cancer,9,10 breast cancer,11,12 and 
Hodgkin lymphoma.13,14 As yet, the risk of cardiac mor-
tality has not been investigated comprehensively within a 
large population of TYA cancer survivors. Only 2 studies 
have analyzed cause-specific mortality within an entire 
population of TYA cancer survivors,15,16 but relatively 
modest cohort sizes (n=9245 and n=16 
769) have left 
important questions unanswered, particularly regarding 
the mortality risk from cardiac disease and how this risk 
may vary by cancer type. There is clearly a need for esti-
mates of cardiac mortality risks among such subgroups 
of survivors of TYA cancer.
Studies of hospitalization complement the under-
standing of mortality risk in a population. Recently, a 
number of studies have addressed the risk of hospital-
ization from cardiovascular disease among survivors of 
cancer diagnosed before 40 years of age.17–20 The larg-
est of these was performed in Denmark using 43 
153 
cancer survivors17 but provided limited information on 
cardiac disease specifically.
The objective of this large-scale population-based 
study was to investigate the long-term risk of cardiac 
mortality among 5-year survivors of TYA cancer. To our 
knowledge, this cohort is the largest ever assembled in 
relation to this age range, with >200 
000 5-year survi-
vors and 2.8 million person-years of follow-up, 15% of 
whom were followed for >30 years. This study includes 
>7 times more cancer survivors than the 2 previous 
studies combined.
MethODs
the teenage and Young adult cancer survivor 
study
TYACSS (The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor 
Study)  is a population-based cohort comprising 200 945 
individuals with cancer diagnosed at 15 to 39 years of age, 
in England and Wales, between 1971 and 2006 inclusive 
who survived at least 5 years from diagnosis. Individuals had 
to be diagnosed with a malignant tumor, unless diagnosed 
with tumors of the brain or bladder, in which case all malig-
nant, benign, and unspecified tumors were included. All indi-
viduals diagnosed with a first primary cancer satisfying these 
criteria were identified and included (see Table 1). Any sub-
sequent primary cancers in these individuals were identified 
and excluded. Comparison with the British Childhood Cancer 
Survivor Study21 enabled identification and exclusion of indi-
viduals who were previously diagnosed with cancer before 15 
years of age. Legal consent to process patient-identifiable 
information was obtained from the Confidentiality Advisory 
Group (NIGB: ECC 3–04 (c) / 2010). Ethical approval was 
given by the National Research Ethics Committee (ref: 16/
LO/0895).
The cohort was ascertained through the Office of National 
Statistics in England and the Welsh Cancer Registry. Linkage 
by the Health and Social Care Information Center provided the 
vital status and emigration status for each survivor. For all 
deaths, the underlying cause of death was also sought from 
the Health and Social Care Information Centre, coded by using 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• Few studies to date have investigated the long-term 
adverse effects of cancer treatment among survi-
vors of cancer diagnosed in teenagers and young 
adults; this study is the largest to date and is popula-
tion based with lengthy follow-up.
• It provides estimates of the risks of death from heart 
disease for each individual type of cancer.
• It also provides estimates of the risk of individual 
cardiac diseases, with special emphasis on the 
dependence of the risk on the age at which the initial 
cancer was diagnosed.
• The results will enable those who are likely to be 
most at risk to be identified.
What are the clinical implications?
• This study provides insight into the cardiotoxicity of 
the treatments given in the past to teenagers and 
young adults for each individual type of cancer.
• It shows that age at cancer diagnosis is an impor-
tant determinant of the risk of death from heart dis-
ease many decades later.
• This age effect was most apparent for survivors of 
Hodgkin lymphoma, who were also found to be at 
the greatest risk overall.
• Population-based risk estimates for survivors of indi-
vidual types of cancer are crucial for the develop-
ment of evidence-based clinical follow-up guidelines 
and recommendations, as well as for future screen-
ing recommendations.

the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth 
Revision, applicable to the year of death. The cause of death 
was available for 98.4% of deaths.
Cancer groupings were based on the internationally estab-
lished classification scheme for TYA cancers22,23 that was 
slightly modified to create finer groupings (see online-only Data 
Supplement Table I).
Cardiac disease was defined using International Classification 
of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes: I01, I02.0, I05 to I09, 
I11, I13, I20 to I25, I27.1 to I27.9, and I30 to I52 and the 
corresponding International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision codes: 391, 392.0, 393 to 398, 402, 404, 410 
to 414, 416, and 420 to 429. A mutually exclusive and 
exhaustive classification of the International Classification 
of Diseases codes was performed by a clinician (D.J.C.) 
to define cardiac disease subtypes (see online-only Data 
Supplement Table II).
statistical analysis
Each individual’s contribution to the person-years at risk 
began at the date of 5-year survival and ended at the earliest 
of February 28, 2014, death, or loss to follow-up because of 
emigration.
Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute excess 
risks (AERs) were calculated by using standard cohort tech-
niques.24 Population-based expected numbers of deaths were 
derived from age (5-year groups), sex, and calendar-year (1-year 
groups) specific death rates for England and Wales combined. 
SMRs were calculated as the ratio of the observed to expected 
numbers of deaths. AERs were calculated as the observed num-
ber of deaths minus the expected number, divided by the per-
son-years at risk, and this quotient was multiplied by 10 
000.

Tests for trend and heterogeneity were performed using 
likelihood ratio tests based on Poisson regression models. 
Statistical significance was defined as 2P<0.05.
Multivariable Poisson regression models for the SMR and 
AER were used to evaluate the potential confounding effect 
of specified demographic and cancer-related factors.24 If the 
results from univariable (Tables 2 through 5) and multivari-
able (online-only Data Supplement Tables III and IV) modeling 
were similar, that is, there was no evidence of confounding, 
then the findings in the text of Results and Discussion were 
reported in terms of SMRs and AERs. If the univariable and 
multivariable modeling results were not similar, that is, there 
was evidence of confounding, then the multivariable results 
were reported in the text of Results and Discussion in terms 
of relative risks or excess mortality ratios. Relative risks and 
excess mortality ratios can be interpreted as ratios of SMRs 
and AERs, respectively, adjusted for other factors included 
within the model. The factors investigated were sex, age at 
cancer diagnosis (5-year groups), decade of cancer diagno-
sis, time since diagnosis (5-year groups), attained age (20–
39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60+ years), and first primary cancer 
type. Attained age and time since diagnosis were never fitted 
in the same multivariable model because of strong collinear-
ity. Within Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5, in addition to providing the P 
value from the univariable modeling for each factor, we also 
provide the P value from the multivariable modeling, which 
is reported in online-only Data Supplement Tables III and IV. 
This enables the reader to assess whether a statistically sig-
nificant relationship remains after adjustment for the speci-
fied confounders. All cancers were analyzed together, and 
the specific cancers with at least 100 cardiac deaths and a 
significantly elevated SMR were investigated separately with 
both univariable and multivariable Poisson regression.
Cumulative risk of mortality, taking account of competing 
risk of death from any cause other than cardiac disease, was 
estimated.

180 (17%) individuals had died: 2016 (6%) deaths 
were attributable to cardiac disease (see Table 1). The 
subtypes of cardiac death were: 1551 (77%) ischemic 
heart disease (IHD), 219 (11%) cardiomyopathy or con-
gestive heart failure (CM/HF), 108 (5%) valvular heart 
disease (VHD), 38 (2%) rheumatic valvular heart disease, 
22 (1%) arrhythmias, 18 (1%) pericardial heart disease, 
and 60 (3%) deaths attributable to other cardiac causes.
cardiac Mortality risk for all cancers combined
The SMR for all types of cardiac disease combined was 
1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–1.4) and the AER 
per 10 
000 person-years was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.6–2.2) 
(Table 2). Cardiac deaths accounted for 2% of all excess 
deaths, and the proportion attributable to cardiac dis-
ease increased slightly with attained age, contributing 
1% among ages 20 to 39 in comparison with 4% at age 
60+ (online-only Data Supplement Table V). The SMR for 
IHD was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2–1.4) and the AER per 10 
000 
person-years was 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0–1.5) (Table 2).
Variation in cardiac Mortality risk by First 
Primary cancer
There was strong evidence of heterogeneity across the 
cancer types for both SMRs and AERs (2P<0.0001). The 
highest SMR and AER for cardiac mortality were observed 
after Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR, 3.8; 95% CI, 3.5–4.2; 
AER, 12.9; 95% CI, 11.4–14.5; see Table 2). The other 
first primary cancer groups with a significantly raised SMR

95% CI, 1.0–2.4), central nervous system tumors (1.4; 
95% CI, 1.1–1.6), cervical cancer (1.3; 95% CI, 1.1–1.5), 
and breast cancer (1.2; 95% CI, 1.1–1.4).
When different cancer types were considered, there 
were considerable variations in the extent to which the 
different types of cardiac disease were increased. Hodg-
kin lymphoma survivors experienced the highest SMR 
and AER for IHD and VHD. However, analyses of CM/
HF mortality indicated that acute myeloid leukemia sur-
vivors had the highest SMR (8.2; 95% CI, 3.7–18.3) and 
highest AER (2.6; 95% CI, 0.2–4.9).
Variation in cardiac Mortality risk by age and 
Decade of Diagnosis
For all cancers combined, a highly significant decreasing 
trend (2P<0.0001) with increasing age at cancer diagno-
sis was shown for both SMRs and AERs for all cardiac dis-
ease (Table 3). The SMR was greatest for individuals diag-
nosed with cancer at 15 to 19 years of age (4.2; 95% CI, 
3.4–5.2), and decreased to 1.2 (95% CI, 1.1–1.3) among 
individuals diagnosed with cancer at 35 to 39 years of 
age. The AER declined from 3.6 (95% CI, 2.7–4.6) to 
1.4 (95% CI, 0.8–2.0) following diagnosis at ages 15 to 
19 and 35 to 39, respectively. These trends with age at 
cancer diagnosis were consistent across IHD, VHD, and 
CM/HF mortality (all SMR 2P≤0.0001 and AER 2P≤0.04). 
There was a substantially raised SMR for valvular heart 
disease among individuals diagnosed with cancer at 15 to 
19 years of age (SMR, 18.3; 95% CI, 10.2–33.1). These 
relationships with age at diagnosis remained after multi-
variable adjustment, apart from the excess mortality ratio 
for IHD and for both relative risk and excess mortality ra-
tio for CM/HF (see online-only Data Supplement Table III).
The overall significant decreasing trend in SMRs of 
all cardiac disease with age at cancer diagnosis was 
primarily attributable to survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma 
and breast cancer (Table 4). For Hodgkin lymphoma, 
those diagnosed at 15 to 19 years of age had an SMR 
of 10.4 (95% CI, 8.1–13.3), in comparison with those 
diagnosed at 35 to 39 years of age with an SMR of 2.8 
(95% CI, 2.3–3.4). The almost corresponding SMRs af-
ter breast cancer were 6.0 (95% CI, 1.9–18.5) and 1.1 
(95% CI, 1.0–1.3) respectively.
As shown in Table 5, the AERs for all cardiac deaths, 
IHD deaths, and VHD deaths all increased significantly 
with attained age, and this remained after multivariable 
adjustment. However, the AERs for CM/HF deaths did not 
vary significantly by attained age (Table 5). The AERs for 
all cardiac deaths and IHD deaths declined with more re-
cent decade of diagnosis, but AERs for VHD and CM/HF 
deaths did not vary significantly with decade of diagnosis 
(Table 5), taking into account the multivariable adjustment.
hodgkin lymphoma survivors
Among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma aged 60+, 
27.5% of all excess deaths were attributable to cardiac 
causes (online-only Data Supplement Table V). The cumu-
lative risk of cardiac mortality was greatest for individu-
als diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma at a younger age: 
among those diagnosed at 15 to 19 years of age, by 
age 55 years the cumulative risk was 6.9% in compari-
son with 2.0% for those diagnosed at 35 to 39 years of

 Cardiac Mortality Among Teenagers and Young Adults

age (log-rank 2P<0.0001). The corresponding expected 
cumulative mortality by age 55 was 0.9% (Figure).
DiscUssiOn
This largest ever study of >200 000 survivors of can-
cer diagnosed in teenagers and young adults reveals 
that age at diagnosis and type of cancer were impor-
tant in determining risk of cardiac mortality. Although 
cancer treatments for specific cancer types have 
changed over the decades during which members of 
the cohort were treated, the variation in treatments 
for any specific cancer over the decades is, in gen-
eral, appreciably less than the variation in treatments 
between different specific cancers; therefore, cancer 
type here may be regarded as an approximate sur-
rogate for treatment history. This study provides evi-
dence on which to base risk stratification for the clini-
cal follow-up of survivors. Here, for the first time, risk 
estimates relating to the entire spectrum of cancers 
diagnosed between ages 15 and 39 have been inves-
tigated in the long term. This is important information 
for both clinicians and survivors.
Survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma were found to have 
the greatest SMR and AER for cardiac disease, and a 
strong decline in both the SMR and the cumulative risk 
with increasing age at diagnosis was clear among these 
survivors. The size of the cohort and extended age range 
enabled us to demonstrate the age effect more clearly 
than ever before. It was independent of attained age and 
years from diagnosis. A similar relationship was observed 
among survivors of breast cancer. However, the absolute 
excess number of cardiac deaths in breast cancer sur-
vivors diagnosed in the youngest age group was small.
Variation in cardiac Mortality risk by type of 
cardiac Disease and type and Decade of cancer 
Diagnosis
The AER for cardiac deaths overall and for ischemic 
heart disease specifically declined with more recent de-
cades of treatment, possibly because the net effect of 
changes in cancer treatments has resulted in a reduction 
in the overall risk of cardiotoxicity following treatment for 
cancer. However, it was somewhat surprising that the 
risk of cardiomyopathy did not vary with decade of treat-
ment given the introduction of anthracyclines in 1980s 
and subsequent widespread use.
Ischemic heart disease, for which radiation is a known 
risk factor,26 accounted for 74%, 74%, and 75% of car-
diac deaths after Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma, and breast cancer, respectively, and considering 
that external beam radiotherapy to the thorax would often 
have been an element of treatment for such cancers, it 
is likely that radiotherapy contributed to the excess risks 
observed. The excess deaths from valvular heart disease 
increased with increasing attained age, even after adjust-
ment for specified confounding factors. Radiation-related 
valvular heart disease has been shown to have a long 
latency period,27 with 1 study of Hodgkin lymphoma sur-
vivors finding a median interval of 22 years between treat-
ment and symptomatic cardiac disease.28 This finding 
may reflect older radiotherapy techniques and higher ra-
diation doses in the earlier decades of diagnosis because 
valvular disease has been shown to be strongly related to 
dose to the heart.29 Anthracyclines have been shown to 
be cardiotoxic, with a recent meta-analysis of randomized 
controlled trials finding that anthracyclines were associ-
ated with a 5-fold increased risk of congestive heart fail-
ure in comparison with nonanthracycline regimens.30 The 
8-fold increased risk of CM/HF after acute myeloid leuke-
mia is likely because of anthracyclines, bearing in mind 
the widespread use of these drugs to treat this disease.
cardiac risk among tYa cancer survivors  
in context
A study by the North American Childhood Cancer Survi-
vor Study sought to evaluate the contribution of modifi-
able cardiovascular risk factors in addition to treatment-
related cardiac damage.31 The authors concluded that 
“it is imperative that childhood cancer survivors exposed 
to chest-directed radiotherapy or anthracycline chemo-
therapy have regular blood pressure monitoring and ap-
propriate management as a high-risk group.”31 A similar 
study is needed among survivors of TYA cancer.
The present study suggests that the SMRs for cardi-
ac mortality among survivors of TYA cancers are lower 
than those seen in childhood cancer survivors, where in-
creases for all cardiac diseases combined have ranged 
from 3.5-fold (95% CI, 2.9–3.2) in the British Childhood 
Cancer Survivor Study9 to 7-fold in the North American 
Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.10 Direct comparison 
of the results of these studies is, however, difficult be-
cause differences in treatment, in the demographics, 
and in the length of follow-up in the different cohorts 
could lead to substantial differences in risk. Studies 
pooling all cancer survivors diagnosed before 40 years 
of age would provide greater opportunities to control 
for such confounding influence.
strengths and limitations
This is by far the largest population-based study yet to 
investigate cardiac mortality risk among survivors of 
cancer diagnosed in teenagers and young adults with 
a total of 2 
867 
878 person-years of follow-up. In this 
cohort, 28% (n=56 
035) were followed up for at least 
25 years from cancer diagnosis, 53% for between 10 
and 25 years, and 19% for a maximum of 10 years. This 
extended follow-up included 1033 IHD, 107 CM/HF, and

77 VHD deaths after 50 years of age, providing a large 
number of events for analysis.
The main limitation is the lack of detailed information 
on exposure to the most relevant treatment modalities: 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Other conventional 
cardiovascular risk factors (eg, smoking) were also not 
available, and the laterality of breast cancer, a known 
determinant of cardiac dose of radiation, was too incom-
plete for analysis. Nested case-control studies will be 
needed to address dose-response relationships of risk in 
relation to treatment exposures and other risk factors, 
and will allow further study of how these relationships 
may vary, for example, with age at exposure.
conclusion
This study demonstrates for the first time that age at 
cancer diagnosis is important in determining the excess 
risk of cardiac death among an entire population of survi-
vors of TYA cancer. This age at diagnosis effect was pri-
marily accounted for by survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma 
and breast cancer, providing useful risk stratification evi-
dence. For evidence-based clinical follow-up of survivors 
estimates of risks that are reliable (from large-scale stud-
ies) and unbiased (from population-based studies) are 
needed for specific groups of survivors defined in terms 
of cancer type, age at cancer, and type of treatment. 
Previously, this detailed information has been available, 
in part, for survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma,13,29,32 but has 
been lacking for most other TYA cancer types. Although 
not stratified by treatment, we provide risk estimates for 
each TYA cancer stratified by age at diagnosis, which is 
a considerable advance on previous knowledge.

This study would not have been possible without funding to 
the University of Birmingham from: Cancer Research UK (grant 
C386/A11709), and the National Institute for Health Research to 
whom we offer our profound thanks. Other Birmingham funding 
was through a postdoctoral fellowship to Dr Raoul Reulen from 
the National Institute for Health Research (PDF-2012-05-280). 
This work was carried out as part of Katherine Henson’s doctoral 
work at the University of Oxford. Katherine was funded by a re-
search contract to the University of Oxford under the Department 
of Health Policy Research Program (Studies of Ionising Radiation 
and the Risk of Heart Disease, 091/0203) and by a studentship 
from the Nuffield Department of Population Health. Other Oxford 
funding was provided by Cancer Research UK (grant C8225/
A21133) and by core funding to the Clinical Trial Service Unit 
(from Cancer Research UK, Medical Research Council, British 
Heart Foundation) and by the British Heart Foundation Center for 
Research Excellence (grant no RE/13/1/30181).
