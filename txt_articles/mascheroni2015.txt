Abstract
Based on data collected through the Net Children Go Mobile survey of approximately 3500 
respondents aged 9–16 
years in seven European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, 
Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom), this article examines the diffusion 
of smartphones among children and contributes to existing research on mobile digital 
divides by investigating what influences the adoption of smartphones among children and 
whether going online from a smartphone is associated with specific usage patterns, thus 
bridging or widening usage gaps. The findings suggest the resilience of digital inequalities 
among children, showing how social inequalities intersect with divides in access and result 
in disparities in online activities, with children who benefit from a greater autonomy of 
use and a longer online experience also reaching the top of the ladder of opportunities.

mobile, ubiquitous Internet access may soon become as constitutive of their social and 
media ecologies as mobile phones.
Therefore, empirical evidence on smartphone ownership and use among young peo-
ple revives new hopes regarding the potential leapfrogging effect of mobile telephony 
(Castells et al., 2007), especially in less advantaged social groups: by providing a cheaper 
and more accessible route to the Internet, it is argued, smartphones with data plans may 
reduce inequalities in access. However, prior research (Donner et al., 2011) has con-
cluded that different devices do not lead to the same Internet experience. Therefore, 
while mobile-based Internet use reduces the access divide, it may actually produce new 
inequalities in terms of usage patterns and skills.
Drawing on the findings of the Net Children Go Mobile project, this article contrib-
utes to existing research on mobile digital divides by investigating what influences the 
adoption of smartphones among children and whether going online from a smartphone is 
associated with specific usage patterns, thus bridging or widening usage gaps.
Literature review
Divides in ownership and usage of mobile phones
Research examining mobile telephony in terms of digital divides has been sparse com-
pared to the body of writing on digital and social inequalities associated with Internet 
access and use. In the field of Internet studies, research has moved past an initial under-
standing of the digital divide as a binary opposition between those who have access to 
online technologies and those who do not, towards a focus on inequalities that lie in 
differential online experiences – what has been defined as the ‘second-level digital 
divide’ (Hargittai, 2002). The refined approach to the digital divide conceptualises the 
issue of digital exclusion as a continuum of divides, whereby a variety of factors – 
divides in access, differential uses and motivations to use, unequal skills, inequalities in 
the ability to benefit from online opportunities – combine and concur to differential 
gradations of digital inclusion (Hargittai and Hinnant, 2008; Livingstone and Helsper, 
2007; Van Dijk, 2005; Warschauer, 2004). Moreover, digital inequalities have been rec-
ognised as strongly related to inequalities in the access to economic, cultural and social 
capital (Helsper, 2012a): opportunities and limitations of the use of information and 
communications technologies (ICTs) are differentiated in intersection with social inclu-
sion and exclusion, whereby ‘those who are already in more privileged positions are 
more likely to use the medium for activities from which they may benefit’ (Hargittai and 
Hinnant, 2008: 615).
Research on mobile telephony from a digital divide perspective has followed a similar 
evolution – from access to inequalities. One of the first studies addressing the mobile 
digital divide investigated the impact of socio-demographic factors on the adoption of 
the Internet and mobile telephony (Rice and Katz, 2003). The study showed that adop-
tion patterns of the Internet and mobile phone were quite similar, with income and educa-
tion being the most influential factors shaping the use of both technologies. Moreover, 
although respondents who were Internet users were also more likely to use mobile 
phones, the authors concluded that mobile phone and Internet users were not necessarily

the same sets of population and that among both, differences persisted between early and 
late adopters. This pointed to a variety of patterns of adoption against mere opposition 
among users and non-users. With an ever-increasing penetration of mobile telephony on 
a global level (International Telecommunication Union [ITU], 2013), income and other 
measures of socio-economic status are now less important predictors of mobile phone 
ownership, although they are still associated with diverse patterns of usage that repro-
duce differences among information-haves, information-have less and information-have 
nots (Castells et al., 2007).
Another socio-demographic factor that has attracted a number of studies on variations 
in ownership and use of mobile phones is gender. Generally, research focused on gender 
divides in mobile communication concluded that while there are no significant gender 
differences regarding access to mobile phones and engagement in traditional communi-
cative practices, specific patterns of use emerged in relation to gender, with recreational 
and non-communicative uses (such as gaming) being the domain of boys (Cotten et al., 
2009) and with girls engaged in producing distinctive mobile phone cultures (Castells 
et al., 2007; Hjorth, 2009).
Finally, other research focused primarily on differences in specific communicative 
practices. For example, Ling et al. (2012) examined how texting is shaped by age and 
gender: based on the analysis of nearly 400 million texts, they found great variations by 
age in the volume of SMS exchanged, thus concluding that ‘texting is a teen phenome-
non’ (p. 294).
Despite a not inconsiderable number of works, we can nonetheless conclude that issues 
of digital inequalities have not been the primary concern of mobile communication stud-
ies, which have generally privileged other topics and approaches, such as the study of the 
domestication of mobile phones into individuals’ and groups’ everyday lives, the investi-
gation of communication and social practices developed around mobile telephony and 
their social implications, the analysis of youth mobile cultures or the reconfiguration of 
private and public spaces (Green and Haddon, 2009; Ling, 2004, 2012).
Divides in usage of smartphones and mobile Internet
With the diffusion of smartphones, mobile phones have turned into an ‘online, networked 
media device’ (Hjorth et al., 2012), which supports an ever-growing repertoire of com-
munication practices and online activities. Therefore, the once independent research 
agendas of mobile communication studies and Internet studies have increasingly con-
verged. As a consequence, the number of studies addressing mobile communication in 
terms of digital inequalities is likely to grow.
A few noteworthy studies have already been published. Among these, Hargittai and 
Kim (2010) examined how a user’s background characteristics and Internet experience 
informed different smartphone usage patterns among a group of young adults. They 
found considerable variation in both the availability of and the effective use of advanced 
phone functionalities. While gender, parental education and ethnic group are important 
factors which partially explain this variation, regular engagement with advanced mobile 
phone functionalities was more strongly correlated with Internet experience, measured 
by both ‘autonomy of use’ – that is, free, unrestricted access to use the Internet ‘when and

where one wants’ (Hargittai and Hinnant, 2008: 606) – and digital skills. ‘People who 
have more Internet access points are more likely to possess higher levels of online skill 
and have more opportunities to explore a wide range of mobile phone features’, Hargittai 
and Kim conclude (2010: 25). This conclusion suggests caution regarding the potential 
leapfrogging effect of mobile Internet devices: instead of bridging digital inequalities, 
smartphone use is rather dependent on and reproduces the so-called second-level digital 
divide (Hargittai, 2002), that is, skills divides and usage gaps that relate to a user’s back-
ground characteristics.
That access to the Internet through mobile devices may lead to a diverse and less 
capital-enhancing Internet experience is also suggested in a study conducted in Armenia 
(Pearce and Rice, 2013). Through a comparison of PC-based and mobile-based Internet 
users, Pearce and Rice found pervasive differential divides for Internet access and online 
activities. Mobile Internet use is more common among lower socio-economic levels of 
the population: mobile phones, then, provide less advantaged social groups with a viable 
alternative to online resources. However, mobile-based users engage in less advanta-
geous and beneficial uses of the Internet: digital inequalities such as differential online 
activities may therefore result in strengthened offline social inequalities, leading to an 
entrenched digital exclusion of the most disadvantaged citizens (see also Helsper, 2012a).
When it comes to younger generations, digital exclusion, some argue, is no longer an 
issue since children are growing up in a convergent media ecology (Prensky, 2001). On 
the contrary, research indicates that inequalities in access, usage, skills and motivations 
to use the Internet persist, even among the so-called digital natives. Studies show how 
age, gender and socio-economic background are correlated with where and how children 
gain access to the Internet (Helsper, 2012b; Livingstone and Helsper, 2007) and how 
socio-demographic factors combined with autonomy of use influence frequency of use 
and number of online activities taken up, thus shaping the progression onto the ‘ladder of 
opportunities’ from basic activities to more interactive, creative and capital-enhancing 
uses (Livingstone and Helsper, 2007).
Research on inequalities in smartphone ownership and use among young people has 
just started. A recent report by the Pew Research Center (Madden et al., 2013) shows that 
the mobile Internet has become pervasive among young Americans aged 12–17 years: 
half of the respondents own a smartphone, and one in four teens report using the Internet 
mostly from their phones. The Pew report also highlights divides in the use of the Internet 
and smartphones based on socio-economic status: teens from disadvantaged families are 
less likely to use the Internet overall; however, teenagers living in lower income and 
lower educated households are just as likely or, in some cases, more likely than peers 
from higher socio-economic households to use smartphones as their primary means of 
Internet access. The implications of this finding in terms of children’s digital inclusion 
need to be further explored: while it is certain that smartphones provide children with 
greater autonomy of use (Hargittai and Hinnant, 2008; Park, 2014), when smartphones 
are the only connection point available, the issue of usage patterns associated with spe-
cific devices becomes crucial, as the risk that mobile Internet use further reinforces social 
exclusions cannot be underestimated.
In this regard, a recently published article (Park, 2014) investigates the second-level digi-
tal divide in mobile communication and concludes that the benefits of mobile telephony are

not uniformly accessible across different youth populations. More specifically, the study 
shows that variations in teens’ social engagement are associated with different socialisation 
patterns and that mobile Internet use may represent a source of social inequalities: a combi-
nation of socio-demographics, parental background and mobile skills and use results in 
lower or greater engagement in ‘socially productive’ activities.
Cross-national comparisons
The diffusion of mobile phones has been uneven across the world due to economic, 
regional and industrial (such as technological standards and pricing systems) factors, 
socio-cultural variations and different media regulations. Moreover, there is evidence of 
differential rates of diffusion, not only across different regions but also within wealthier 
economies (Castells et al., 2007).
While European countries have been at the forefront of the adoption of mobile com-
munication, inequalities persist across countries and also among children, especially 
regarding Internet use. The EU Kids Online country classification (Helsper et al., 2013), 
for example, distinguishes European countries on the basis of daily Internet use among 
children, online activities, incidence of online risks and parental mediation strategies. 
This suggests that the context in which young people domesticate smartphones is far 
from uniform. We therefore assume cross-national variations as important factors influ-
encing the adoption and use of smartphones.
In undertaking comparative research, researchers can rely on different models and 
aim at different theoretical goals. In this article, we focus on countries as the ‘context of 
study’ (Kohn, 1989; Livingstone and Hasebrink, 2010); in other words, we aim to assess 
hypotheses concerning social inequalities in mobile Internet access and use by testing 
their applicability in different national contexts.
Hypotheses
As we have seen, research on mobile Internet use among adults and young adults points 
to differential gradations in digital inclusion and to the interplay between digital and 
social inequalities: socio-demographic factors, Internet experience and range of availa-
ble devices to access the Internet are all influential factors explaining the second-level 
digital divide and the usage gap (Hargittai and Hinnant, 2008; Hargittai and Kim, 2010; 
Van Deursen and Van Dijk, 2014). While in Western societies it is especially Internet 
users who benefit from greater autonomy of use (Hargittai and Hinnant, 2008), in less 
advantaged social contexts smartphones may represent the primary means of Internet 
access (Pearce and Rice, 2013). On the other hand, studies of children and the Internet 
have emphasised persisting inequalities based on gender, age and socio-economic back-
ground, at least on the quality of access (Helsper, 2012b; Livingstone and Helsper, 2007). 
Furthermore, there are indications that teenagers’ mobile Internet use is related to social 
inequalities (Madden et al., 2013) and to the process of socialisation (Park, 2014).
Differential engagement in online opportunities is a better measure of digital inclu-
sion compared to access to devices per se. However, as smartphones are currently being 
domesticated among the youngest, we are first of all interested in understanding what

influences adoption. Moreover, since differences in children’s online experiences persist 
across Europe (Helsper et al., 2013), we aim to explore country variations in the domes-
tication of smartphones in this age group. Based on these reflections, we propose two 
hypotheses concerning children’s access to smartphones:
H1. Ownership of smartphones will vary by age, gender, country, socio-economic 
background, parental ownership and use of mobile devices, and child’s Internet 
experience.
H2. Accordingly, the daily use of smartphones will also vary by age, gender, country, 
socio-economic status, parental ownership and use of mobile devices, and child’s 
Internet experience and also by ownership of smartphones.
Beyond the question of access, we are also interested in differences in usage that may 
be related to mobile Internet access. As outlined in the ‘Literature review’ section, empir-
ical evidence so far has indicated large variations in online activities among adult 
PC-based and mobile Internet users (Donner et al., 2011; Pearce and Rice, 2013), as well 
as among mobile Internet users (Hargittai and Kim, 2010; Park, 2014). Among children, 
autonomy of use seems to reduce inequalities in online activities; moreover, research has 
shown that the wider the range of online activities pursued, the more the child progresses 
along the ‘ladder of opportunities’ (Livingstone and Helsper, 2007). Despite potential 
constraints deriving from parental or school regulation (Mascheroni and Ólafsson, 2014), 
smartphones provide children with greater autonomy of Internet use (Park, 2014). Based 
on this, the following hypothesis concerning online activities is formed:
H3. Access to smartphones broadens the number and type of online activities children 
engage in, thus shaping children’s progression on the ‘ladder of opportunities’. More 
specifically, we hypothesise that the number and type of online activities children 
engage in on a weekly basis varies by age, gender, smartphone ownership and daily use, 
child’s experience with the Internet and parents’ ownership and use of mobile devices.
Methods
Data and sampling
This article draws on data collected in 2013–2014 in a sample of Internet-using children 
aged 9–16 years in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United 
Kingdom as part of the Net Children Go Mobile project. In each country, a stratified 
sample of approximately 500 children was drawn through a random methodology – ran-
dom walk route based on prior random selection of sampling points in all countries 
except Denmark, where households were randomly selected based on national residents 
lists – resulting in a total of 3565 respondents. Using a very conservative approach, the 
response rate ranged from 21% in Denmark to 56% in Romania.
Similar to the 2010 EU Kids Online survey on the same age group (Görzig, 2012), 
questionnaires were administered face to face at home and self-completed for sensitive

7
questions on risky experiences, lasting 40 minutes on average. The selection of this par-
ticular age group is based on methodological and theoretical considerations: 9–16 years 
old offer an insight into the early process of encountering and coping with online risks, 
while also being amenable to parental mediation. The questionnaire included many of 
the questions already asked in the EU Kids Online project – to facilitate comparison over 
time – and new questions on smartphones and tablets; it underwent cognitive testing in 
all countries in order to ensure the highest possible comprehension by children and to 
evaluate the validity of translations in national languages. Validation of translations also 
relied on the process of translation and back-translation already completed during the EU 
Kids Online II project (Görzig, 2012).
Measures: independent variables
User background. Parents were asked about socio-demographics. The parent who 
answered the questionnaire was to be ‘the parent/carer in the household who is likely to 
know most about selected child’s use of the Internet’. Interviewers also noted whether 
the parent was in the role of mother (73%), father (23%) or another carer (4%). Socio-
economic status was measured as a combination of the household income and the educa-
tional attainment of the main income earner in the household. With respect to children’s 
demographic variables, interviewers were asked to indicate the age and gender of all 
children eligible to take part in the survey (respondents were then selected on the basis 
of the last birthday method).
Parents’ experiences with the mobile Internet. Parents were also asked to indicate whether 
both (in the case of two-parent households) were Internet users and whether they owned 
a smartphone or a tablet that they used to go online. Prior research suggests that use of 
the Internet by parents shapes the social context of Internet use: more specifically, a par-
ent’s domestication of the Internet is associated with quality of access and frequency of 
Internet use among children (Mascheroni et al., 2012). Since the use of the Internet 
among sampled parents is almost universal in all countries (89–99%), except in Romania 
(57%), including it as a predictor is of limited value in the analysis. Thus, we focus on 
parents’ ownership of mobile devices.
Child’s Internet experience. Since research has shown that the quality and number of 
online opportunities vary by age and number of years the child has used the Internet for 
(Livingstone et al., 2011; Livingstone and Helsper, 2007), we collected information on 
the age of first Internet use. More specifically, children were asked how old they were 
when they first used the Internet. They were also asked how old they were when they had 
their first mobile phone and first smartphone. However, since mobile Internet use seems 
more influenced by Internet experience than traditional mobile communicative practices 
(Hargittai and Kim, 2010), we focus on the number of years a child has been online for.
Country. As anticipated, we use the country as the ‘context of study’ (Kohn, 1989; Liv-
ingstone and Hasebrink, 2010) to assess how patterns of access and use are differentiated 
across countries.

Measures: dependent variables
Smartphone ownership. Children were asked the following question: ‘Do you personally 
own or have for your private use any of these devices? By private use of a device we mean 
a device that only you use’. Overall, 46% of children say that they own a smartphone, 
although smartphone ownership varies consistently by age and country (Figure 1).
Daily use of smartphones. We asked children how often they used different devices at dif-
ferent places to access the Internet. Of the respondents, 41% reported using smartphones 
several times per day or at least daily to go online, with great variations by age and country 
(Figure 1).
Type and number of online activities. Children were asked how often (several times each 
day, daily, at least every week, never or almost never) they engaged in a number of online 
activities from any of the devices they use to go online. We collected information regard-
ing 25 activities (for a detailed list of online activities, see Mascheroni and Ólafsson 
(2014)). Here, we focus on watching videos as a measure of leisure online activities, on

social network sites as an indicator of communication practices and using the Internet for 
schoolwork as a proxy for academic and information usage (Kalmus et al., 2011). Since 
we hypothesised that children who use smartphones are on average more likely than those 
who do not use smartphones to engage in more complex types of activities and to be 
higher up on the ‘ladder of opportunities’ (Hasebrink et al., 2011; Livingstone and Hel-
sper, 2007), we also look at those children who engage in at least two activities associated 
with Levels 4 and 5 as defined by Hasebrink et al. (2011: 27–28), namely: playing games 
with other people on the Internet; publish photos, videos or music to share with others; use 
file sharing sites; download music or films; post a message on a website or a blog; create 
a pet or an avatar; using a webcam; visiting a chatroom; spending time in a virtual world.
Results
Access and use
H1. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the effect of age, gender, coun-
try, years online, parental education and parent’s ownership and use of mobile devices 
on children’s likelihood of owning a smartphone (see Table 1). Model 1 includes only 
the main effects of these variables and indicates that age, country and use of mobile 
devices by parents are strongly correlated with children’s smartphone ownership. 
Together, these variables account for around a third of the variability in smartphone 
ownership.
More specifically, the probability of children owning a smartphone increases by 58% 
for each year they grow older (Model 3). Regarding country variations, children in 
Denmark are almost three times as likely to own a smartphone as children in the United 
Kingdom. Children in Italy have a similar likelihood of owning a smartphone as children 
in the United Kingdom, while Belgian, Irish, Portuguese and Romanian children are 
much less likely to do so. We can also observe an effect of the child’s Internet experience, 
with children who started to use the Internet later than average being less likely to own a 
smartphone. Socio-economic status does not seem to be related to smartphone owner-
ship; however, children whose parents use mobile devices to go online are almost three 
times as likely to own a smartphone. Vice versa, when parents do not use mobile devices, 
their children are unlikely to own such a device.
Model 2 tests for interaction between age and country (adding variables which are the 
multiplication of age and the dummy variable for each country). The possibility of an 
interaction between age and gender was also explored but was not significant: boys and 
girls seem to acquire smartphones at a similar age. There is, however, an interaction 
effect between age and country and between age of first Internet use and country. These 
interaction effects are explored in Figures 2 and 3. Adding the interaction terms to the 
model does not improve the overall model fit in terms of the explained variance, but 
offers a more accurate assessment of the effect of individual variables.
Figure 2 shows the predicted probabilities of a child owning a smartphone by age and 
country for girls (the boys are much the same) who began to use the Internet when they 
were of an average age (7 years), in households with average socio-economic status

(mode = 35%) and where their parents have a mobile device (mode = 64%). The results 
show that the reason why fewer children in Romania own smartphones is partly because 
older children in this country are less likely to own smartphones than older children 
elsewhere, while in Belgium and Portugal younger children are less likely to own a 
smartphone compared to their peers in other countries.
If we then look at the age of first Internet use, the main effect is that as children start 
using the Internet at an older age, they are less likely to own a smartphone. If we add an 
interaction term by country, then this effect is statistically significant just for Italy, where 
the decrease in smartphone ownership has a stronger correlation with age of first Internet 
use than in the other countries. If we calculate the predicted probabilities of owning a 
smartphone and look at this by country and as beginning age of Internet use runs from 4 
to 11 years for a 12-year-old girl (the boys are much the same), where the child lives in 
an average socio-economic status household and where parents have a mobile device, we 
see clearly how the higher age of first Internet use has a bigger effect in Italy.
H2. If we use the model for smartphone ownership (Table 1, Model 1) as a starting 
point in examining daily use of smartphones, we can observe similar patterns (Table 
2, Model 1) in terms of age, gender, country and socio-economic status differences. 
However, daily use would seem unlikely unless the child owns a smartphone, and 
indeed, around 60% of the variability in daily use of smartphones can be explained by 
smartphone ownership (Model 2). On the other side, this finding also suggests that 
smartphone use is not simply a question of ownership.
If we compare the coefficients in Models 1 and 2, we can note that age still has an 
important effect. And differences in country effects between the two models suggest 
potential country interactions that are worth exploring. The third model in Table 2 adds 
interaction with age and ownership of smartphones, gender and ownership (adding vari-
ables that are a multiplication of the original variables), as well as countries and owner-
ship. The gender and ownership interaction is not relevant, while the importance of 
ownership seems to increase with age. In Ireland and Denmark, ownership seems to be 
less important in terms of explaining daily use than in the other countries, while it is 
more important in explaining daily use in Portugal.
The interaction effects again are best explored by looking at them graphically. Figures 
4 and 5 show the predicted probability of a child using a smartphone daily at any loca-
tion. Figure 4 shows the predicted probability of using a smartphone daily for children 
who own a smartphone, while Figure 5 shows this for children who do not have a smart-
phone for private use. The analysis suggests again that the main reason why children do 
not access the Internet on a smartphone is because they do not own one. But it also indi-
cates a very important age effect. Thus, even if a 9-year-old child owns a smartphone, the 
probability that she will use it to access the Internet is as low as 39% in Belgium; how-
ever, if 16-year-old teenagers own a smartphone, then there is about an 80–90% likeli-
hood of them using it to go online. Figure 5 also shows that in Denmark and Ireland, 
older children are still quite likely to have accessed the Internet from a smartphone on a 
daily basis, even if they do not own one.

H3. To address this hypothesis, we first look at the number of activities that children 
engage in on a daily basis. Most children engage in only a few of the 25 activities

measured on a daily basis; in fact, half engage in four or fewer activities every day. As 
a result, the variable for the number of activities has a positive skew. To compensate 
for this, we use a logarithmic transformation of the dependent variable and then report 
the exponential of the slope coefficients to indicate the proportional effect of the inde-
pendent variables. Table 3 shows two linear regression models for the log-number of 
online activities.
Model 1 includes the same independent variables as previous models for ownership 
and daily use of smartphones. Here, we can see that with each year a child grows older, 
the number of online activities they engage in increases by 19% and that girls engage in 
slightly fewer activities than boys (around 6% fewer). Children in Romania, Italy, 
Denmark and Portugal pursue on average more online activities than their UK counter-
parts. Higher age of first Internet use is related to a smaller number of online activities, 
with each year a child grows older before starting to use the Internet being related to a 
7% reduction in the number of online activities. Socio-economic status and parents’ use 
of mobile devices is not correlated with number of activities engaged in by children. 
Conversely, using a smartphone to access the Internet at least daily is associated with a 
substantial increase (70%) in the number of online activities.

Model 2 adds interaction terms for age and daily smartphone use as well as gender 
and daily smartphone use. These indicate that using smartphones to access the Internet 
on a daily basis has a slightly bigger effect on the number of online activities for younger 
children.
The question of types of activities can be approached both from the viewpoint of dif-
ferent kinds of activities (e.g. leisure, communication and information, as in Kalmus 
et al., 2011) and from the viewpoint of different complexities – the so-called ladder of 
opportunities, whereby children tend to progress from basic to participatory uses of the 
Internet (Livingstone and Helsper, 2007). Table 4 shows four logistic regression models

17
using the same independent variables used in Table 3. However, the focus here is rather 
on the extent to which smartphone use might be related to different types of activities. 
The first three models explore the probability of using the Internet at least weekly for 
schoolwork, watching video clips and visiting profiles on social network sites. The fourth 
model shows the probability of engaging in at least three activities associated with Levels 
4 and 5 in the ladder of opportunities (Hasebrink et al., 2011; Livingstone and Helsper, 
2007).
Looking across the four models, age has a similar effect on all activities, with the 
likelihood of children engaging in these activities increasing by 30–85% for each year 
they grow older. The effect of gender is smaller, but highest when considering use of the 
Internet for schoolwork and use of social network sites, with girls being 26% more likely 
than boys to do both at least weekly. Country effects are, however, more diverse, with 
children in Italy, Portugal and Romania being considerably more likely to use social 
network sites than their peers in the United Kingdom. While parents’ use of mobile 
devices has a low effect on leisure and communication activities, socio-economic status 
has a diverse effect across the activities examined, with children from medium socio-
economic status homes 36% more likely to use the Internet for schoolwork than lower 
socio-economic status children, and children from higher socio-economic status house-
holds 69% less likely to use social network sites. Smartphone users are more likely to 
engage in entertainment and communication activities – but smartphone daily use is not 
correlated with use of the Internet for schoolwork – and they are between three and four 
times more likely than those who do not use smartphones to reach at least Level 4 in the 
ladder of opportunities. Pursuing activities in the creative sphere also increases among 
older children, children in Denmark, Ireland, Italy and, especially, Romania, and chil-
dren whose parents also use smartphones or tablets to go online. By contrast, the likeli-
hood of reaching Levels 4 and 5 on the ladder of opportunities increases by age (49% for 
each year a child grows older) but decreases by 11% each year a child grows older before 
starting to use the Internet; there is, however, no gender difference.
Figure 6 shows the interaction between age and smartphone use in the third model in 
Table 4 by looking at the predicted probability of girls in the United Kingdom visiting 
social networking sites by age and smartphone use: daily use of smartphones makes less 
of a difference for teenagers aged 16 years. Figure 7 shows the interaction between age 
and smartphone use in the fourth model (in Table 4) by looking at the predicted probabil-
ity of girls in the United Kingdom reaching Level 4 or 5 on the ladder of opportunities 
by age and smartphone use. In this case, the divide between children using a smartphone 
daily to go online and those who do not becomes narrower by age, but is still 
noteworthy.
Discussion and conclusion
In this article, we have examined variations in the ownership and use of smartphones among 
children aged 9–16 years in order to understand what socio-demographic factors influence 
the adoption and regular use of smartphones and whether smartphone use is associated with 
specific patterns of online activities and with children’s progression from basic to more 
advantageous uses of the Internet. These research questions have guided the analysis.

Concerning ownership, the most influential factor explaining variations in the adop-
tion of smartphones is whether parents themselves use a smartphone or a tablet to go 
online. There are also large variations by country, age and children’s experience with the 
Internet, while gender and parents’ socio-economic status show little or no effect on 
smartphone ownership. These findings have some implications for the access digital 
divide among children. First, we can conclude that socio-economic background does not 
seem to have a simple and direct effect on children’s adoption of smartphones. Rather, it 
is mediated by the domestication of smart mobile devices, both at a family level and at a 
country level. In households and countries with a higher domestication of the mobile 
Internet, smartphones are also more diffused among children. Second, since children 
who start to use the Internet later are less likely to own a smartphone, we can conclude 
that smartphones do not provide alternative access to the Internet for children who have 
not had any opportunity to go online regularly before. If we consider the interaction 
between age in general and age of first Internet use more specifically, these findings are, 
instead, consistent with prior studies on inequalities in Internet use among children in 
showing that autonomy of use – here measured by access to the Internet by means of a 
private mobile device – increases with age and online experience (Livingstone and 
Helsper, 2007). In other words, and in accordance with studies on young adults (Hargittai 
and Hinnant, 2008; Hargittai and Kim, 2010; Park, 2014), children with more Internet 
experience also benefit from greater autonomy of use. Therefore, this suggests caution 
regarding the leapfrogging effect of mobile devices: not only is the potential of smart-
phones to bridge the access digital divide weaker among children than it is among adults 
(Pearce and Rice, 2013), but as autonomy of use is associated with the take-up of more 
online activities, including more beneficial activities, then divides in access result in dif-
ferential uses and activities.
Second, we investigated how daily use of smartphones varies by age, gender, country, 
parental education, parental ownership and use of mobile devices, child’s Internet expe-
rience and ownership of smartphones. If daily use is mainly predicted by ownership, we 
observed a significant interaction of age and country, whereby younger children in gen-
eral, and younger children in Belgium, Ireland and Romania more specifically, are less 
likely to use a smartphone to go online on a daily basis. This finding suggests that the 
access divide cannot simply be reduced to material access to devices: The availability 
and cost of connectivity also matter, as well as parental mediation strategies (e.g. the 
choice not to provide younger children with an Internet plan in order to limit their unsu-
pervised Internet use). Indeed, younger children are less likely to be provided with an 
Internet plan on their smartphones: of the children aged 9–10 years, 36% use only WiFi 
networks to go online from their smartphones, 14% use either a WiFi connection or a 
mobile Internet plan and just 9% access the Internet using only an Internet plan 
(Mascheroni and Ólafsson, 2014). This suggests further caution against easy assump-
tions on the potential of smartphones to reduce digital inequalities in access.
We were also interested in understanding whether the use of smartphones is associ-
ated with variations in the number and type of online activities children undertake and, 
more specifically, whether smartphone use is associated with less or more capital-
enhancing uses of the Internet. Consistent with prior studies on children and the Internet 
(Livingstone and Helsper, 2007; Livingstone et al., 2011), we found that the number of

new media & society 
online activities varies by age, gender and Internet experience: older children, boys and 
those who have started to use the Internet at a younger age are more likely to engage in 
a wider range of online activities. Country of residence also matters, while a household’s 
socio-economic status or parents’ ownership and use of mobile devices is not influential. 
However, the greatest variation in the number of online activities is explained by daily 
use of smartphones: as observed among adults (Hargittai and Hinnant, 2008), users who 
benefit from more autonomous access to the Internet engage in a wider range of online 
activities. Regarding the type of activities children undertake, beyond persisting differ-
ences by age, gender and child’s Internet experience, we found that smartphone use is 
associated with a consistent increase in social networking and entertainment activities 
but is not correlated with use of the Internet for schoolwork. Moreover, we also observed 
a significant correlation between daily use of smartphones to go online and children’s 
progression on the ladder of opportunities: children who access the Internet from their 
smartphones on a daily basis, and especially younger children, are more likely to pursue 
activities included in Stages 4 and 5 of the ladder of online opportunities. Therefore, the 
findings of research on the adult population showing that smartphones are associated 
with less capital-enhancing activities, thus reducing the access divide while widening the 
usage gap (Pearce and Rice, 2013), are not supported by the empirical evidence pre-
sented here. However, the findings are at least partially supportive of the ‘second-level 
digital divide’ (Hargittai, 2002; Hargittai and Hinnant, 2008): indeed, gaining participa-
tory activities is correlated with autonomy of use and with the number of years a child 
has been using the Internet for, suggesting that both technological platforms and different 
family backgrounds still function as sources of online disparities that are mirrored in, and 
entrench, offline inequalities. Moreover, there are indications that children from medium 
or higher socio-economic status households engage in more productive uses of the 
Internet compared to peers from lower socio-economic backgrounds, which is consistent 
with studies on adults (Van Deursen and Van Dijk, 2014).
We have observed a general pattern, whereby access to smartphones is influenced by 
parental domestication of the mobile Internet, child’s age and Internet experience, and 
country; moreover, daily use of smartphones is strongly, but not exclusively, predicted by 
ownership; and, finally, more capital-enhancing uses of the Internet are strongly associ-
ated with autonomy of use, which, in turn, is associated with smartphone ownership, 
parents’ use of mobile devices and age of first Internet use. While this pattern is valid 
throughout Europe, some variations across countries are noteworthy. In terms of access 
to smartphones, children in Romania, Portugal and Belgium are generally less likely to 
own a smartphone, but Portuguese children who own a smartphone are the most likely to 
use it daily to go online, together with Italian children, who, at the same time, are the 
least likely to own a smartphone if they start using the Internet late. These findings sug-
gest that, despite being mediated by family’s domestication of the Internet, socio-eco-
nomic and cultural inequalities across and within European countries can still influence 
autonomy of use. On the other hand, cross-national comparison also shows that benefi-
cial uses of the Internet vary largely across countries, despite being strongly predicted by 
autonomy of use (measured by daily use of smartphones), child’s age and parents’ use of 
mobile devices: here, inequalities may also be the product of different parental mediation 
strategies, with restrictive approaches in the so-called protected by restrictions countries

(Helsper et al., 2013) restricting opportunities as well as reducing risks, the United 
Kingdom being a paradigmatic example (Mascheroni and Ólafsson, 2014).
To conclude, this study aimed at showing the resilience of digital inequalities among 
a segment of the population – children – who are usually assumed to be on the ‘right’ 
side of the digital divide. It has also shown how social inequalities intersect with divides 
in access and result in disparities in online activities, with children who benefit from a 
greater autonomy of use and a longer online experience also engaging in more produc-
tive and capital-enhancing uses of the Internet. However, this study has some limita-
tions that may make findings about differential access and use of the Internet among 
children less generalisable. First, the relatively low response rate registered in some 
countries limits the extent to which we can draw generalisable conclusions from the 
sample. Nonetheless, the study offers unique comparative data on children’s ownership 
and use of smartphones.
Second, the research was conducted in Europe, in a context where digital inequalities 
persist, but where both the number of Internet users and mobile telephony subscriptions 
are above the world average (ITU, 2013). As a consequence, we did not have the oppor-
tunity to examine a significant number of Internet users who access the Internet exclu-
sively from smartphones: smartphone use is almost always complementary to access from 
other platforms, with smartphone and laptop being the most common combination.
A third major limitation lies in the structure of the questionnaire: due to the specific 
requirements that research with children implies, in terms of comprehension of the 
questions as well as length of the questionnaire, we did not ask children what activities 
they engage in on different devices. What we are showing is correlations between 
smartphone use and the number of online activities overall, or the frequency of specific 
sets of activities. Research on children who only use smartphones to go online, com-
pared to children who benefit from a variety of access devices and locations, may help 
better understand the relationship between smartphone use, digital inequalities and 
social inequalities.
Another divide that has not been addressed in this article, and that could instead help 
grasp the potential of mobile devices, is digital skills. Despite having measured a number 
of self-reported online skills, including instrumental, informational, safety skills and com-
municative abilities, at this stage we have limited our analysis to access and use. Future 
analysis on the dataset may, then, provide further confirmation for these conclusions.
