Abstract
Previous studies have shown changes in women’s behavior and physical appearance
between the non-fertile and fertile phases of the menstrual cycle. It is assumed that these
changes are regulated by fluctuations in sex hormone levels across the cycle. Receptors for
sex hormones have been found on the vocal folds, suggesting a link between hormone lev-
els and vocal fold function, which might cause changes in voice production. However,
attempts to identify changes in voice production across the menstrual cycle have produced
mixed results. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate changes in sexually
dimorphic vocal characteristics and quality of women’s voices in different phases of the
cycle and to compare these with users of monophasic hormonal contraception. Voice sam-
ples (vowel phonation) of 44 naturally cycling women were obtained in the menstrual, late
follicular (confirmed by LH surge) and luteal phases, and in 20 hormonal contraceptive
users across equivalent stages of the monthly cycle. Results showed that voices of naturally
cycling women had higher minimum pitch in the late follicular phase compared with the
other phases. In addition, voice intensity was at its lowest in the luteal phase. In contrast,
there were no voice changes across the cycle in hormonal contraceptive users. Comparison
between the two groups of women revealed that the naturally cycling group had higher mini-
mum pitch in the fertile phase and higher harmonics to noise ratio in the menstrual phase. In
general, present results support the assumption that sex hormones might have an effect on
voice function. These results, coupled with mixed findings in previous studies, suggest that
vocal changes in relation to hormonal fluctuation are subtle, at least during vowel produc-
tion. Future studies should explore voice changes in a defined social context and with more
free-flowing speech.
Introduction
Over the last two decades, there has been growing interest in various changes in women’s
appearance and behavior across the menstrual cycle, especially in how the fertile period com-
pares to other stages of the cycle. For example, previous studies have shown that during their
fertile period, women have an increased preference for male masculine traits [1], extra-pair

 sexual interests and fantasies [2, 3], tendency to flirt with an attractive man [4], to wear attrac-
tive clothes that are more revealing, and to dress more provocatively [5, 6]. Women also take
care more about their looks [6], consume fewer calories, and spend more money on beauty
products when they are fertile [7]. Furthermore, Miller, Tybur & Jordan [8] reported that
exotic dancers earn more money during their fertile days. This implies that men can detect
subtle changes in the fertile period, and it is possible that they rely on olfactory and visual
information. In line with this, previous studies showed that women’s body odour changes
across the cycle, being most attractive in the fertile period [9–12]. With regard to visual ovula-
tion cues, Roberts et al. [13] reported that men chose women’s photographs taken in the fertile
phase as more attractive than photographs of the same women taken in the luteal phase. Simi-
larly, Bobst and Lobmaier [14] showed that prototype faces of women in the fertile phase are
more attractive.
Considering ultimate causes of these changes, it is assumed that they represent an adapta-
tion with the purpose of finding an adequate partner and enhancing the genetic quality of
any potentially resulting offspring [15] (but see [16]). With respect to proximate causes, it is
assumed that these changes are caused by fluctuations in sex hormone levels across the cycle.
Estrogen levels peak in the late follicular phase, which corresponds to the period of highest
conception probability, while progesterone levels peak in the luteal phase. On the contrary, the
menstrual phase is characterized by low levels of both sex hormones.
Receptors for sex hormones have been found on the vocal folds [17, 18], which suggests a
link between hormone levels and vocal fold function. Hence, besides investigating olfactory
and visual cues of ovulation, researchers have recently focused on auditory information by
exploring voice changes across the cycle and the possibility that voice might similarly convey
information about women’s fertility.
Generally, voice can convey valuable information about various characteristics of the
speaker, such as sex, body shape and size [19], and emotional state [20]. It was also recently
found that voice could provide information about genetic quality. It was found that voice
attractiveness was related to fluctuating asymmetry, which is thought to reflect genotype’s
resilience to environmental stressors [21]. In contexts relevant to potential vocal changes
across the menstrual cycle, increased estrogen levels during the late follicular phase result in
thickening of the laryngeal mucosa and increased mucus production, while increased proges-
terone levels during the luteal phase result in drying of the laryngeal mucosa [22]. These pro-
posed physiological changes in the laryngeal mucosa in relation to hormone fluctuation might
cause changes in voice production, as well as in voice quality and perceived attractiveness.
Indeed, research has revealed that attractiveness ratings of women’s voices varied across the
menstrual cycle, with higher ratings being found for voices recorded in the fertile phase [23–
27], and lowest ratings for voices recorded in the menstrual phase [28]. This implies that voice
is also a potentially valuable source of biologically important information such as women’s
fertility.
Considering which acoustic characteristics might reveal fertility, most researchers have
focused on fundamental frequency of phonation (F0), which is perceived as voice pitch. F0 is
based on the rate of vocal fold vibrations, which depends on the size, thickness and length of
the vocal cords [22]. Women have smaller, thinner and shorter vocal cords than men, so their
vocal cords vibrate at higher frequencies [22, 29]. Consequently, women have higher-pitched
voices than men, which makes this acoustic characteristic a sexually dimorphic trait. Previous
studies showed that F0 is related to ratings of attractiveness. For example, women with higher-
pitched voices are perceived as more attractive [30–33], younger [34], more feminine [35],
and more desirable spouses [36]. In addition, faces of women with higher-pitched voices are

 perceived as more attractive [37]. Furthermore, when presented with higher-pitched female
voices, men visualize younger women with attractive and feminine faces [38].
The literature reviewed above suggests that voice pitch could change across the menstrual
cycle, causing an increase in voice attractiveness during mid-cycle. However, attempts to
detect proposed acoustic changes have produced mixed results. While Bryant & Haselton [23]
found an increase in voice pitch in the fertile period, many other studies report no significant
changes across the cycle [39–45]. Furthermore, in a recent study conducted by Tatar et al. [46]
on a sample of Turkish women, voice pitch was higher in the follicular than in luteal phase,
but did not differ significantly from the pitch recorded in the menstrual phase. To complicate
matters further, Amir, Kichon-Rabin, & Muchnik [47], Fischer et al. [24], and Karthikeyan &
Locke [25] found a decrease in voice pitch during the fertile phase; in the latter study, voice
was rated as more attractive in the fertile period but these ratings did not correlate with cycle
differences in pitch. This implies that other acoustic characteristics, which also change across
the cycle, may be involved in how others perceive them. Indeed, researchers investigated
changes of other sexually dimorphic acoustic characteristics, like pitch variability (F0 SD),
which is an indicator of vocal stability. Higher values of F0 SD are found in female voice,
which makes it less monotone and stable in comparison to male voice [29, 48, 49]. Previous
study also revealed changes in F0 SD in response to attractiveness of potential partner, and
competition against an attractive rival [50]. However, no changes in F0 SD were found across
the cycle [23, 24].
Besides focusing on sexually dimorphic acoustic characteristics, parameters that signal
vocal quality were also assessed in previous studies. These parameters include frequency per-
turbation (jitter), amplitude perturbation (shimmer) and harmonics to noise ratio (HNR).
Higher values of jitter or shimmer, and lower HNR values, all indicate irregularity in vocal
cord vibration, which is usually perceived as breathiness and vocal hoarseness. On the con-
trary, lower jitter and shimmer, and higher HNR values, are related to greater vocal quality.
Chae et al. [41] and Tatar et al. [46] found higher jitter during the premenstrual period com-
pared to the follicular phase, which suggests greater quality of voice in the fertile phase. Fischer
et al. [24] reported lower HNR in the menstrual compared to the late follicular phase. On the
contrary, Tatar et al. [46] found no difference between the menstrual and follicular phases, but
higher HNR in the follicular phase compared to the luteal phase. Nonetheless, Bryant & Hasel-
ton [23] found no changes in these parameters across the menstrual cycle. C
¸elik et al. [42] also
failed to find any acoustic changes, but self-reported vocal quality did vary across the cycle,
with the lowest quality reported by women in the luteal phase.
There are several methodological aspects to consider to address these inconsistent findings.
First, it is noticeable that the sample size is small in some of the studies [24, 41, 42, 44], with
only seven or fewer participants in some of them (39, 47), which could have resulted in insuffi-
cient statistical power to detect subtle vocal changes. Second, methods used to identify cycle
phases vary between studies; researchers have relied on participant’s self-reports of cycle
length, and used cycle counting methods [39, 40, 43, 44, 46, 47] or other less precise methods,
such as measuring body temperature [45] to identify the cycle phases. In studies where cycle
phases were identified with more reliable methods, such as direct assessment of hormone levels
or confirmation of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in mid-cycle [23, 25], voice was mea-
sured in only two cycle phases (follicular and luteal). As Fischer et al. [24] pointed out, while
difference in any voice characteristic between the two phases could be suggestive, it is not pos-
sible to conclude that it conveys information about women’s fertility status, because the value
of this characteristic in the rest of the cycle (e.g. in the menstrual phase) is unknown. Finally, a
direct comparison of voice between women with natural cycles and users of hormonal contra-
ception (HC) is lacking. This comparison might be valuable in examining the assumption that

 vocal changes across the cycle are due to fluctuations in sex hormone levels. Hormonal profiles
of women who use monophasic contraceptive pills, where all pills contain the same concentra-
tions of sex hormones, are stable across the cycle [51, 52]. Hence, any difference in voice
between HC users and non-users in different stages of menstrual cycle could be attributed to
sex hormone fluctuations.
Considering all these methodological aspects, the purpose of this study was to investigate
sexually dimorphic vocal features and quality of voice in different phases of menstrual cycle,
among naturally cycling women and HC users. It was predicted that the values of sexually
dimorphic vocal characteristics, as well as vocal quality, would be higher in the late follicular,
compared to the menstrual and luteal phases, in women with natural menstrual cycles. Fur-
thermore, considering the stable hormonal profile of HC users, no systematic changes in their
vocal characteristics were expected. Regarding between-group comparisons, it was predicted
that naturally cycling women would have higher values of sexually dimorphic traits and voice
quality than HC users, especially so during the late follicular phase, which is characterized by
increased estrogen levels in non-users.
Method
Participants
All participants gave written informed consent to voluntarily participate in this study. The
Ethic Committee of Research Involving Humans at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sci-
ences of University of Zagreb in Croatia approved the study design. Participants were 62
women with regular menstrual cycles (between 24 and 35 days in length) and who had not
taken hormonal contraceptives or any other kind of hormonal therapy within the previous
three months, and 21 women using monophasic hormonal contraceptives and who had been
using these for at least 3 months prior to the start of the study.
All women were students at the University of Zadar, Croatia. They had no diagnosis of any
kind of endocrine (e.g. polycystic ovaries, endometriosis) and respiratory problems (e.g.
chronic asthma) or speech impairments (e.g. rhotacism). All of them reported being non-
smokers, native speakers of the Croatian language, and not being involved in any kind of pro-
fessional or amateur singing education or training. Of the 62 naturally cycling women, data
from ten were omitted due to the LH surge not being detectable, four were omitted because
the high fertility session took place more than three days before the LH surge, two due to per-
sonal reasons (e.g. moving to another city) and one for reporting respiratory health problems
(allergic asthma) during the study. In addition, voice recordings of one participant were dis-
carded due to technical issues during the recording. Of 21 women who were using hormonal
contraceptives, one was omitted because she stopped using birth control during the study.
The final sample included in analyses thus consisted of 44 naturally cycling women with an
average cycle length of 29.29 days (SD = 2.99), and 20 users of hormonal contraceptives, with
19 of these using combined monophasic pills and one using monophasic patches. It is worth
noting that pills and patches regulate menstrual cycle in the same manner; patches release the
same daily concentration of synthetic hormones, as does the pill [53]. All users had been using
hormonal contraceptives for between 3 and 48 months (Mmonth = 17.75, SD = 14.42) before
the study started. All brands of hormonal contraceptives used by women in this study con-
tained greater concentration of synthetic progesterone (gestodene or drospirenone, 3 mg)
than synthetic estrogens (ethinylestradiol, from 0.02–0.035 mg).
In addition, it is worth mentioning that the smaller number of contraceptive users than nat-
urally cycling women in this study was due to relatively low prevalence of hormonal birth con-
trol usage in Croatia. By collecting information on health profiles of more than 700 female

 students at the University of Zadar during sample recruitment, data showed that less than 10%
were using hormonal contraception, which is in line with the prevalence of this kind of birth
control in southeast Europe [54]. Considering that the users of this form of contraception have
less variability of menstrual cycle length and stable hormone levels throughout the cycle, a
smaller sample size of this group was justified.
Mean age of the participants was 21.64 years (SD = 1.79, range 19–25 years), with no signifi-
cant age difference between the groups (t = 0.03, df = 62, p = .978).
Identification of menstrual cycle phases
Voice recordings were obtained in the menstrual, late follicular and luteal phases. Natural
cycle phases were identified by reverse counting method, with LH surge confirmation using
LH test kits. Since self-reported measures based on the women’s recall of cycle length are less
reliable [55, 56], women with natural menstrual cycles were instructed to track their cycles for
at least 3 months before study onset. They were also instructed to send the exact dates of
menses onset to the researcher via email each month. Based on this, the researcher calculated
the length of the shortest cycle in the past period for every woman and used this information
to estimate the date of the next period. The session in late-follicular phase was scheduled 15
days before this date, while the start date of the LH testing was scheduled 17 days before the
next period. The LH surge was assessed with a commercially available urine ovulation kit
(Ovugnost) that was given to participants on their first visit to the laboratory. Participants were
given instructions for using LH tests at home, and asked to continue testing until they obtained
a positive result. When this occurred, participants brought the positive test to the laboratory
for inspection. All voice recordings in the late follicular phase were obtained between 3 days
before and 2 days after the LH surge (M = 0.05 days; SD = 1.20). An LH surge precedes ovula-
tion by 24–48 hours, which means that late follicular sessions took place during the fertile win-
dow [57, 58].
Voice samples in the luteal phase were obtained after ovulation and before the next menses.
On average, luteal sessions took place 7.07 days prior to actual menstrual onset (SD = 1.95).
Collection of voice samples in the menstrual phase was scheduled following self-report of
menses onset, and was on the third or fourth cycle day, when sex hormone levels are lowest
[57, 58]. The first two days of the cycle were omitted in order to avoid possible symptoms like
heavy bleeding or pain, which are more pronounced during the first 48 hours of the cycle [59].
After all three sessions, women reported the date of the onset of the next period, by which
researcher confirmed that the voice sample were collected in targeted phases. Voice recording
sessions scheduled for users of hormonal contraception corresponded to those scheduled for
naturally cycling women. The equivalent session to the menstrual phase was held on the third
or fourth cycle day, in late follicular phase 15 days prior the expected onset of next period,
which was between the 11th and 16th cycle day (M = 13.24, SD = 1.27) The session in the luteal
phase was scheduled between the 20th and 23rd cycle day (M = 21.40, SD = 1.10).
Session order was counterbalanced across participants. Each woman began the sessions in
one phase and then proceeded in order through the remaining phases. Among women in the
natural cycle group, 9 of them started in the late follicular phase, 14 in the luteal and 21 in the
menstrual phase. Among users of hormonal contraceptives, 6 of them started in the late follic-
ular, 5 in the luteal, and 9 in the menstrual phase.
Procedure
Voice recording sessions took place in a soundproof room. At the beginning of each session,
the researcher checked if women showed any symptoms of respiratory problems, upper airway

 infection, or symptoms of flu or cold. If a woman showed no symptoms, she was instructed to
drink one glass of water, after which the recording started. Voices were recorded using a
Zoom H4N digital recorder, featuring built-in condenser microphones in an X-Y stereo pat-
tern, and placed at fixed distance of approximately 40 cm from the participant’s mouth. A con-
stant recording sound level was used. The recording sampling rate was set for 48 kHz at 24-bit
amplitude quantization.
Participants were instructed to produce five monophthong vowels (/a/ as in ‘bar’, /e/ as in
‘let’, /i/ as in ‘bee’, /o/ as in ‘cold’ and /u/ as in ‘you’). Recordings were stored and uncom-
pressed WAV format was used in voice analyses.
Results
Acoustical analysis
Voice samples were analysed using Praat software (version 5.3.51) [60]. Pitch floor and ceiling
were 100 Hz and 500 Hz, in accordance with the programmers’ recommendations for analys-
ing female voice [60]; otherwise, default settings were used. All recordings were first inspected
aurally and visually for quality, and to ensure no other sounds were present.
Following previous research [23, 30], sexually dimorphic vocal characteristics: fundamental
frequency (F0), its variability (F0 SD), minimum (F0min), and maximum values (F0max) were
averaged across the sequence of vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/. Characteristics related to vocal
quality, perturbation measurements (jitter and shimmer) and HNR were measured on the
vowel /a/ phonation. Voice intensity (dB), which corresponds to the loudness of the sound,
was also assessed by averaging intensity values across the sequence of vowels.
Effects of session order on vocal characteristics
Before the main analysis, the potential effect of session order on voice was examined. There
were three different session orders in this study. However, an equal number of women with 3
different session orders was not accomplished. For example, there were 19 women with natural
cycles who had their first session in the menstrual, then in the late follicular and luteal phases.
However, there were only 12 who had the first session in the late follicular phase. In order to
examine whether session order had an effect on voice changes in different phases of the men-
strual cycle, analyses using repeated general linear models on each of the dependent variables
of interest (vocal characteristics) were conducted, with the cycle phase as a within-subject fac-
tor, and session order as a between-subject factor. Analysis showed no significant main effects
of session order, nor any interaction effects of session order and cycle phase on vocal charac-
teristics (all ps > .05).
Voice changes across the menstrual cycle
Before the analyses, univariate normality was tested for all variables, and Skewness and Kurto-
sis indices (see Kline’s criteria for normal distribution [61]) pointed to a normal distribution
for all variables. In order to investigate vocal changes across the cycle, analyses using repeated
general linear models on each of the vocal characteristics were conducted, with cycle phase as
a within-subject factor. Analyses were conducted separately for women with natural cycles and
HC users.
Descriptive values of vocal characteristics for women with natural cycles and the analysis
results are presented in Table 1.
Analyses showed significant changes in F0min and voice intensity across the menstrual
cycle, both with the large effect sizes. Post hoc analysis (LSD tests) revealed that women had

 higher F0min in the late follicular compared to the menstrual phase (p = .002), while the differ-
ence between late follicular and luteal phases did not reach a statistically significant level
(p = .097). There was no difference between menstrual and luteal phases (p = .147). Generally,
women had higher values of this sexually dimorphic acoustic parameter in the late follicular
phase, suggesting more feminine voice during their fertile period.
Furthermore, voice intensity was lowest in the luteal phase. Post-hoc analysis revealed that
voice intensity was significantly lower in the luteal compared to menstrual (p = .002) and late
follicular phase (p = .040). There was no difference between menstrual and late follicular
phases (p = .297). All other acoustic parameters were stable across the cycle.
Next, voice changes across the cycle among HC users were analysed. Descriptive values of
vocal characteristics of users of HC, and the results of the analyses, are presented in Table 2. As
expected, among HC users, there were no voice changes across the cycle.
In subsequent analyses, differences in voice characteristics between the two groups of
women were tested. Due to the differences in sample size between the groups and significant

 Leven’s tests (p < .05) that pointed to unequal variances between groups, vocal characteristics
of the two groups were directly compared by using corrected F ratios given by Welch test. F
ratios were obtained for each vocal characteristic in each menstrual cycle phase. Results are
presented in Table 3.
Comparison of the two groups of women revealed that the two groups of women differed
in their F0min in the late follicular phase. Naturally cycling women produced a higher mini-
mum pitch compared with HC users. Furthermore, women in the natural cycle group had
higher values of HNR, but only in the menstrual phase. The difference in the late follicular
phase approached the threshold for statistical significance (p = .072), although pη2 pointed to a
medium effect size. This result indicates that the natural cycle group had higher quality of
voice with less noise, which was most pronounced in the menstrual phase.
Discussion
This study examined voice changes among naturally cycling women and HC users in three
phases of the menstrual cycle. There are three key findings. First, results showed some voice
changes across the natural menstrual cycle. Second, as expected, there were no changes in
vocal characteristics across the cycle in HC users. Third, HC users and non-users differed in
minimum pitch and HNR, with all differences pointing to more feminine voice with less noise
among women with natural cycles.
Broadly speaking, these results offer support for the assumption that natural fluctuation of
sex hormones might be the mechanism underlying voice changes across the menstrual cycle.
However, only two vocal parameters changed significantly—F0min and voice intensity. As
expected, non-users had lower minimum pitch in the late follicular compared to the menstrual
phase, which indicates a stereotypically more feminine voice during the fertile period. How-
ever, F0min in the fertile period did not differ significantly from the luteal phase. Therefore, it is
not possible to make any strong conclusion about whether this is directly related to fertility sta-
tus. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that changes in F0min values in this study correspond to
changes in estrogen levels across the cycle. Estrogen levels are lowest in the menstrual phase,
and highest in the late follicular phase. Similarly, lowest F0min was found in the menstrual
phase, highest F0min in the late follicular phase, with values in the luteal phase being intermedi-
ate but more similar to those observed in the late follicular phase. Increased estrogen levels

 might have had a proliferative effect on laryngeal mucus [22, 39], hence enabling production
of higher-pitched tones in the late follicular phase. On the contrary, decrease in estrogen levels
might cause decrease in F0min by changing musical secretions and vocal cord muscles tonicity.
It is clear, however, that without direct hormone level assessment it is not possible to make
any strong claims about this proposed mechanism, especially because the difference in F0min
between late follicular and luteal phase was not significant.
Furthermore, women had lowest voice intensity in the luteal phase. Changes in voice inten-
sity cannot be directly explained by hormonal influence on the vocal folds because intensity
depends neither on vocal fold length nor mucosa with receptors for sex hormones. However,
an indirect hormonal effect is possible. Voice intensity depends on airstream pressure from the
lungs. Pressure depends on activation and arousal, where lower activity decreases the pressure,
and higher activity increases it. The latter is usually observed in high emotional states [20].
Since progesterone levels are known to decrease activation levels through regulation of inhibi-
tory GABA neurotransmitters and cortisol levels [62, 63], lower activation in the luteal phase
might lead to lower airstream pressure and lower voice intensity. However, in a rare study
of voice intensity changes across the menstrual cycle, Tatar et al. [46] found no significant
changes. Thus, future investigation of this acoustic feature is warranted.
It is worth reiterating that described effects were observed among naturally cycling women,
but were absent among HC users. This implies that voice changes are regulated by sex hor-
mones fluctuations, possibly either through direct influence on vocal cords, or indirectly by
regulation of activation level.
Regarding the voice differences between groups, it was expected that women with natural
cycles would have more feminine voice and higher vocal quality, especially when groups were
compared in the late follicular phase. The results confirmed the initial assumption only with
respect to F0min, which was higher during the fertile period among naturally cycling women.
This implies their greater vocal femininity and ability to produce higher pitched tones in com-
parison with HC users. Since vocal femininity is related to higher estrogen levels, differences
between groups could be explained by increased estrogen levels in the late follicular phase in
natural cycles, and the almost 90% decrease of natural estrogen in cycles regulated by HC [52].
However, it is noteworthy that, in the fertile period, groups differed only in F0min, while other
sexually dimorphic vocal parameters remained the same for both groups.
Groups significantly differed in HNR values in the menstrual phase and marginally signifi-
cantly in the late follicular phase. Both differences indicate greater vocal quality with less noise
among women with natural cycles. It is worth noting that previous studies have found an
opposite difference in voice quality between HC users and non-users [39, 47]. Previous
researchers reported that pill users had greater vocal quality, assessed by jitter, shimmer [39,
47], and HNR parameters [39], arguing that the relatively stable hormonal profile of HC users
leads to greater vocal quality. However, they reported an overall group effect, regardless of the
cycle phases, and used smaller sample sizes than in the present study, with only five [47] and
seven [39] women in each group.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that hormonal levels were not directly measured in the
present study. Therefore, it is not possible to make any strong claims about direct influence of
sex hormones on voice changes across the cycle, especially because of great intra- and inter-
individual variability in the menstrual cycle length and levels of steroid hormones [64]. The
importance of direct assessment of steroid hormones in studying fertility-related changes in
highlighted in a recent study by Marcinkowska et al., [65]. By daily measuring of steroid hor-
mones in saliva samples throughout the entire menstrual cycle, authors did not find support
for cycle-related changes in preference for male masculine traits. Results of this study suggest

 that the direct assessment of sex hormones in studying mate choice and changes related to fer-
tility status in necessary.
In summary, significant vocal changes across the menstrual cycle and differences in vocal
quality between women with natural cycles and HC users are mostly in line with the initial pre-
dictions. However, only few vocal characteristics significantly varied across the cycle. These
results, combined with mixed findings in previous studies, suggest that vocal changes across
the menstrual cycle are quite subtle. Based on the present findings, it is not possible to make
strong inferences about voice as a source of fertility status information, at least not by analys-
ing voice during vowel production. Vowels represent the most common and classical form of
vocal stimulus used in acoustic analysis, because this methodology has some important advan-
tages. First, some acoustic parameters can only be measured during vowel phonation (jitter,
shimmer, HNR). Second, this methodology enables control for many other factors that could
affect voice parameters, such as semantic meaning, intonation, and variability due to different
utterances. Thus, it increases experimental control. However, human communication is far
more complex than vowel phonation. Hence, it is possible that additional vocal changes might
be detected by analysing meaningful sentences recorded in a defined social context. Starting
from the main assumption that voice changes in the fertile phase have a function in mating
behavior, future studies should look for vocal changes in a mating context at various stages of
menstrual cycle. Recently, Karthikeyan and Locke [25], in the first study on cycle-related
speech changes in a defined mating context, attempted to detect changes in women’s voice
pitch during voice messages recorded towards a masculine and a feminine man in fertile and
non-fertile cycle phases. These authors simulated a speed dating context and presented female
participants with male voices, manipulated in voice pitch to sound more or less masculine.
Surprisingly, they found lower pitch in women’s fertile phase, regardless of the men’s mascu-
linity. There is a possibility that women did not find the men’s voices sufficiently attractive to
alter their voice pitch in the predicted manner, or perhaps auditory stimuli were not adequate
for a successful simulation of speed dating. Therefore, future studies are needed to address the
question of vocal changes in relation to fluctuations of sex hormones in a defined social/mat-
ing context, which should perhaps include visual, instead of auditory, stimuli in order to simu-
late communication between women and potential partners.
