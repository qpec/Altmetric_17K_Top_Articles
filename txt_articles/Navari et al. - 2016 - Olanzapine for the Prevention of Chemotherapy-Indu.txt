Abstract
BACKGROUND—We examined the efficacy of olanzapine for the prevention of nausea and 
vomiting in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
METHODS—In a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we compared olanzapine with placebo, 
in combination with dexamethasone, aprepitant or fosaprepitant, and a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 
3–receptor antagonist, in patients with no previous chemotherapy who were receiving cisplatin 
(≥70 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or cyclophosphamide–doxorubicin. The doses of 
the three concomitant drugs administered before and after chemotherapy were similar in the two 
groups. The two groups received either 10 mg of olanzapine orally or matching placebo daily on 
days 1 through 4. Nausea prevention was the primary end point; a complete response (no emesis 
and no use of rescue medication) was a secondary end point.
RESULTS—In the analysis, we included 380 patients who could be evaluated (192 assigned to 
olanzapine, and 188 to placebo). The proportion of patients with no chemotherapy-induced nausea 
was significantly greater with olanzapine than with placebo in the first 24 hours after 
chemotherapy (74% vs. 45%, P = 0.002), the period from 25 to 120 hours after chemotherapy 
(42% vs. 25%, P = 0.002), and the overall 120-hour period (37% vs. 22%, P = 0.002). The 
complete-response rate was also significantly increased with olanzapine during the three periods: 
86% versus 65% (P<0.001), 67% versus 52% (P = 0.007), and 64% versus 41% (P<0.001), 
respectively. Although there were no grade 5 toxic effects, some patients receiving olanzapine had 
increased sedation (severe in 5%) on day 2.
CONCLUSIONS—Olanzapine, as compared with placebo, significantly improved nausea 
prevention, as well as the complete-response rate, among previously untreated patients who were

 receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute; 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02116530.)
Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are associated with a significant deterioration 
in quality of life and are perceived by patients as major adverse effects of cancer treatment.1 
The use of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists,2 dexamethasone,2 and 
neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonists3-9 has significantly improved the control of this 
troublesome side effect. International guidelines10-12 recommend combinations of these 
agents to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients receiving 
moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Nonetheless, nausea remains a major 
problem for many patients.1,2
Olanzapine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antipsychotic 
agent that blocks multiple neurotransmitters: dopamine at D1, D2, D3, and D4 receptors; 
serotonin at 5-HT type 2a, 5-HT type 2c (5-HT2c), 5-HT3, and 5-HT type 6 receptors; 
catecholamines at alpha1-adrenergic receptors; acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors; and 
histamine at H1 receptors in the central nervous system.8,9,13 Side effects may include mild 
short-term sedation,13–15 as well as weight gain and an increased risk of diabetes mellitus 
with prolonged use (>6 months).15–17 The activity of olanzapine at multiple receptors, 
particularly the D2, 5-HT2c, and 5-HT3 receptors, which may be involved in nausea and 
vomiting, suggests that it might have clinically significant antiemetic properties.
A single-institution phase 3 trial showed that olanzapine, when combined with a single dose 
of dexamethasone and a single dose of palonosetron, an HT3-receptor blocker, was effective 
in controlling early and longer-term nausea and vomiting in patients receiving highly 
emetogenic chemotherapy.18 Additional single-institution phase 3 studies have shown that 
olanzapine combined with standard antiemetic agents improves control of nausea and 
vomiting in patients receiving moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy.19,20 A recent 
review, however, pointed to possible methodologic issues in these single-institution studies 
and called for well-planned, randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies to evaluate the 
role of olanzapine in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.21
The primary objective of the current trial was to evaluate olanzapine, as compared with 
placebo, for the control of nausea in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy, 
with nausea prevention assessed during three periods: 0 to 24 hours, 25 to 120 hours, and 0 
to 120 hours after chemotherapy. Secondary objectives were to compare the two study 
groups for the number of patients with a complete response (no emesis and no rescue 
therapy) in the three periods, as well as to evaluate potential toxic effects of olanzapine.
Methods
Eligibility Criteria
Patients 18 years of age or older with malignant disease who had not received previous 
chemotherapy were eligible for enrollment in the study if they were scheduled to receive 
highly emetogenic chemotherapy (either cisplatin at a dose ≥70 mg per square meter of 
body-surface area, with or without other chemotherapeutic agents, or doxorubicin at a dose

 of 60 mg per square meter plus cyclophosphamide at a dose of 600 mg per square meter) 
and had a European Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 
(on a 5-point scale, with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher numbers indicating increasing 
disability). Additional eligibility criteria were a serum creatinine level of 2.0 mg per deciliter 
(177 µmol per liter) or less, an aspartate or alanine aminotransferase level that was no more 
than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, and an absolute neutrophil count of at least 
1500 per cubic millimeter; no nausea or vomiting in the 24 hours before enrollment; no 
severe cognitive compromise; no known history of central nervous system disease (e.g., 
brain metastases or a seizure disorder); no treatment with another antipsychotic agent such 
as risperidone, quetiapine, clozapine, a phenothiazine, or a butyrophenone within 30 days 
before enrollment or plans for such treatment during the study period; no long-term use of a 
phenothiazine as an antipsychotic agent (patients could receive prochlorperazine and other 
phenothiazines as rescue antiemetic therapy); no concurrent use of amifostine; no concurrent 
abdominal radiotherapy; no concurrent use of quinolone antibiotic therapy; no chronic 
alcoholism; no known hypersensitivity to olanzapine; no known cardiac arrhythmia, 
uncontrolled congestive heart failure, or acute myocardial infarction within the previous 6 
months; and no history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.
Because of the teratogenic potential of the therapy used in this trial, women of childbearing 
age had to have a negative result of a pregnancy test performed within 7 days before 
enrollment. They also had to agree to use appropriate birth control throughout their 
participation in the study.
Study Design and Oversight
Patients were assigned to a study group with the use of the Pocock and Simon dynamic 
randomization procedure, which balances the marginal distributions of the stratification 
factors between study groups. The stratification factors were sex, chemotherapy regimen 
(cisplatin-containing regimen vs. anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide), and the specific 5-
HT3–receptor antagonist used (palonosetron, ondansetron, or granisetron). The patients and 
the medical professionals who cared for them were unaware of the assigned study regimen. 
The patients were assessed for only one chemotherapy cycle. Rescue therapy of the treating 
investigator’s choice was permitted for nausea, emesis, or retching, depending on the clinical 
circumstances.
All patients gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the institutional 
review board at each participating site and was independently monitored by the Alliance 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Data collection and analyses were conducted by the 
Alliance Statistics and Data Center. Data quality was ensured by a review of data performed 
by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center and by the study chairperson (the first author) 
according to Alliance policies. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the 
data and analysis and for adherence to the study protocol, available with the full text of this

 Treatment Regimen
All participants received a 5-HT3–receptor antagonist (palonosetron intravenously at a dose 
of 0.25 mg, granisetron intravenously at a dose of 1 mg or orally at a dose of 2 mg, or 
ondansetron intravenously or orally at a dose of 8 mg, with the specific agent chosen by the 
primary clinician) on day 1 of chemotherapy, dexamethasone (12 mg orally on day 1, and 8 
mg orally on days 2, 3, and 4), and an NK1-receptor antagonist on day 1. In addition, 
patients received olanzapine (10 mg per day orally) or a matching placebo on days 1 through 
4. The NK1-receptor antagonist was intravenous fosaprepitant (150 mg on day 1) or oral 
aprepitant (125 mg on day 1, and 80 mg on days 2 and 3). The doses of the 5-HT3–receptor 
antagonists, dexamethasone, and aprepitant used in the study are the standard doses 
recommended by various international guidelines for antiemetic agents.10–12 The dose of 
olanzapine was chosen on the basis of previous studies.2,18,19,22 In a phase 1 trial of 
olanzapine as a prophylactic antiemetic agent, Passik et al.22 determined that 10 mg per day 
for 4 days was a dose associated with no toxic effects except minimal sedation. In a phase 2 
trial, Navari et al.23 used a loading dose of olanzapine (administered daily for 2 days before 
chemotherapy) but subsequently determined that a loading dose was not necessary.18
Study Visits and Assessment Procedures
In the prestudy period, all pertinent demographic characteristics and medical data were 
recorded. Patients were asked to complete daily records of episodes of vomiting or retching 
(number and time) and the use of rescue therapy from the first day of chemotherapy (day 1) 
through day 5. Patients were also asked to record daily levels of nausea according to a 
visual-analogue scale24 ranging from 0 (“no nausea at all”) to 10 (“nausea as bad as it can 
be”). A study nurse contacted each patient daily on days 2 through 5 to ask about toxic 
effects and remind the patient to complete forms. Adverse events were graded according to 
the terminology and grading categories defined in the National Cancer Institute’s Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. In addition, every day for 5 days, 
patients rated undesired sedation and undesired increase in appetite on numerical scales 
(with scores ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater sedation or appetite 
increase).
Outcomes
The primary end point, no nausea, was defined as a response of 0 on the visual-analogue 
scale for nausea during the overall assessment period (0 to 120 hours), the early assessment 
period (0 to 24 hours), and the later assessment period (25 to 120 hours). The proportion of 
patients with no nausea was compared between treatment groups sequentially: first for the 
overall period and then for the early and later periods concurrently. This hierarchical order 
was chosen because we considered relief for the overall period to be most important and 
relief in the early and later periods to be of equal secondary importance.
Secondary end points included a complete response (no emetic episodes and no use of 
rescue medication). A complete response was determined on the basis of the patients’ daily 
records during the overall, early, and later assessment periods and reported adverse events.

 Statistical Analysis
A group sequential design with an interim analysis for superiority and futility was adopted 
for this trial. The interim analysis was to be conducted when 50% of patients had been 
enrolled and had completed their daily assessments of nausea and vomiting. We used the 
Lan–DeMets family25 of alpha- and beta-spending functions corresponding to the O’Brien–
Fleming boundary to control for overall type I and type II error rates. At the interim analysis, 
a P value greater than 0.003 and less than 0.844 indicated that the trial would continue.
For the primary end point, we used chi-square tests to compare the proportion of patients 
with no nausea between treatment groups sequentially, first for the overall period, and then 
for the early and later periods together. A serial Simes gatekeeping procedure25 for the 
interim and final analyses was used to maintain the overall significance level at the level 
specified by the Lan–DeMets alpha-spending function. Logistic models were used to 
incorporate stratification factors, baseline scores, and other characteristics of the patients. 
The primary analysis did not include missing data because of the small number of patients 
with missing data for the primary end point, but a sensitivity analysis was performed to 
evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis.
The modified intention-to-treat principle26 was applied for the primary analysis of efficacy 
in the population of patients who could be evaluated. This population was defined as all 
patients meeting the eligibility criteria who did not withdraw from the study before receiving 
treatment and had no major protocol violations (see the Supplementary Appendix, available 
at NEJM.org).
A previous study18 showed that the proportion of patients not receiving olanzapine who 
were free of nausea during the overall assessment period was about 40%. Considering that a 
17.5% increase in this proportion would be a clinically meaningful effect size, we calculated 
that we would need to enroll 332 patients (166 per group) to achieve 90% power to detect 
this effect size at the 5% significance level, using a two-sided chi-square test for a fixed 
sample size. We increased the sample size to 338 patients (169 per group) after adding an 
interim analysis for superiority and futility. The sample size calculation and simulation for 
operating characteristics of the group sequential design were conducted with the use of East 
software, version 5.4 (Cytel).
Analyses of secondary end points were exploratory in nature, and reported P values for these 
analyses have therefore not been adjusted for multiple comparisons. Growth-curve models 
were used for repeated measures of symptoms and secondary end points.
Results
Study Patients
Figure 1 (and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) shows the distribution and 
randomization of the study patients. A total of 401 patients at 46 academic or community 
practice institutions in the United States were randomly assigned to a study group between 
August 2014 and March 2015; 380 patients (192 assigned to olanzapine and 188 assigned to 
placebo) began the study.

 Demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1 for the 380 patients who 
began the study and who did not have major protocol violations. There were no significant 
differences between the olanzapine and placebo groups in terms of age, race, sex, 5-HT3–
receptor inhibitor received, chemotherapy regimen administered, ECOG performance status, 
or primary site of disease. In each group, a majority of the patients were women and a 
majority received chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide. The 
distribution of institutions was balanced between the study groups.
Efficacy
An interim analysis was performed in February 2015, after primary end-point data had been 
recorded for 50% of the patients on the basis of their daily assessments of nausea and 
vomiting. A P value of 0.3599 for the chi-square test comparing the two study groups with 
respect to the proportion of patients who had no nausea during the overall assessment period 
indicated that we should continue enrolling patients according to the group sequential 
design. At the final analysis, the proportion of patients who had no nausea (the primary end 
point) was significantly greater in the olanzapine group than in the placebo group in each of 
the three assessment periods: early period, 74% vs. 45% (P = 0.002); later period, 42% vs. 
25% (P = 0.002); and overall period, 37% vs. 22% (P = 0.002) (Table 2). When all the 
patients with missing data were considered to have had nausea, the results were similar, with 
P values of less than 0.004 for the early, later, and overall periods.
Likewise, there were significant differences between the olanzapine and placebo groups with 
respect to freedom from clinically significant nausea — that is, a nausea score of less than 3 
on a scale from 0 to 10, as defined in previous reports.1,2,6,27–29 The proportion of patients 
receiving olanzapine who had no clinically significant nausea was 87%, versus 70% of those 
receiving placebo, in the early period (P = 0.001), 72% versus 55% in the later period (P = 
0.001), and 67% versus 49% in the overall period (P = 0.001).
The proportion of patients with a complete response was significantly higher in the 
olanzapine group than in the placebo group in all three assessment periods. During the early, 
later, and overall periods, the proportions were 86% vs. 65% (P<0.001), 67% vs. 52% (P = 
0.007), and 64% vs. 41% (P<0.001), respectively (Table 3).
Adverse Events
There were two grade 3 adverse events (fatigue and hyperglycemia) in the olanzapine group 
and two grade 3 adverse events (abdominal pain and diarrhea) in the placebo group. There 
were three grade 4 adverse events (two of which were hematologic) in the olanzapine group 
and no grade 4 adverse events in the placebo group. No grade 5 adverse events were reported 
in the study. None of the grade 3 or 4 adverse events were attributed to olanzapine by the 
attending clinician.
Figure 2A shows that patients receiving olanzapine, as compared with those receiving 
placebo, had significantly increased sedation (severe in 5%) on day 2 as compared with 
baseline. The sedation resolved on days 3, 4, and 5, even though patients continued to 
receive olanzapine on days 3 and 4. No patient discontinued the study because of undesired 
sedation. Figure 2B shows that there were no significant differences between the olanzapine

 and placebo groups with respect to undesired increase in appetite on days 2 through 5 after 
chemotherapy as compared with baseline.
Discussion
This large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial showed that it is 
more effective to combine olanzapine than placebo with an NK1-receptor antagonist, a 5-
HT3–receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in 
patients who have not received previous chemotherapy but are currently receiving highly 
emetogenic chemotherapy. Patients who received olanzapine were more likely than those 
who received placebo to be free of nausea and emesis in the early, later, and overall 
assessment periods.
The benefit of olanzapine in controlling nausea and emesis has been suggested in other 
phase 3 trials.19,20 These trials showed that when olanzapine was added to guideline-
directed prophylactic agents, nausea and emesis were significantly reduced. The efficacy of 
olanzapine for nausea control contrasts with the findings in clinical trials of NK1-receptor 
antagonists. Although these agents (aprepitant, fosaprepitant, netupitant, and rolapitant) 
significantly controlled early and later emesis in patients receiving moderately or highly 
emetogenic chemotherapy they appear to have been less effective in controlling nausea.1–7,18
In our study, patients who received olanzapine had more drowsiness on day 2 than at 
baseline, but for the most part, this symptom abated on days 3, 4, and 5, despite continued 
administration of oral olanzapine on days 3 and 4, suggesting that the patients adapted to the 
sedative effect of olanzapine. Undesired increase in appetite was not seen in the current trial. 
There were no serious adverse events related to olanzapine, and no patient discontinued 
olanzapine because of toxic effects. In view of the temporary drowsiness reported in this 
trial and previous reports of temporary drowsiness,13–15 more detailed information on 
drowsiness ratings, as well as the use of a lower dose of olanzapine (5 mg), could be 
explored in future trials.
A limitation of our study is that we evaluated only one dose level of olanzapine. Lower or 
higher doses may have an effect on efficacy, toxic effects, or both. In addition, the study did 
not address the efficacy of olanzapine for multiple chemotherapy cycles. These issues should 
be considered in future clinical trials. In conclusion, our study showed that olanzapine 
combined with an NK1-receptor antagonist, a 5-HT3–receptor antagonist, and 
dexamethasone is more effective than placebo combined with these agents for the prevention 
of nausea and vomiting in patients with no previous chemotherapy who are receiving highly 
emetogenic chemotherapy.

 Figure 2. Ratings of Undesired Sedation and Undesired Increase in Appetite in the Olanzapine 
and Placebo Groups
Patients were asked to record daily levels of undesired sedation and undesired increase in 
appetite using a visual-analogue scale ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (“as bad as it can be”). 
The mean scores for undesired sedation (Panel A) and undesired increase in appetite (Panel 
B) are shown for 5 days after chemotherapy. I bars indicate standard errors.

*The Wilcoxon test was used to compare age between the two study groups, and Fisher’s exact test was used for comparisons of the other 
characteristics. There were no significant between-group differences. Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding. 5-HT3 denotes 5-
hydroxytryptamine type 3.
†Race or ethnic group was self-reported.
‡The European Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is measured on a 5-point scale, with 0 indicating no symptoms and 
higher numbers indicating increasing disability.

*A complete response (a secondary end point) was defined as no emesis and no use of rescue medication.
†Odds ratios are for emesis or the use of rescue medication (i.e., lack of complete response) in the olanzapine group as compared with the placebo group.
‡P values were calculated with the use of the chi-square test.
§P values were calculated according to the Simes gatekeeping procedure.
