 Nail polish and nail 
hardeners
This guide is for you ...
if you are one of 
the 14,500 nail 
technicians  
working in  
Oregon today.
Some of the nail-care 
products that you use 
at work, such as nail 
polish, polish removers, 
and nail hardeners, contain 
dangerous chemicals that 
could harm you if you don’t use them properly!
How can nail-care products harm you?
Nail polish and nail hardeners 
can irritate your eyes, skin, 
and lungs. Prolonged exposure 
can cause birth defects. Try to 
avoid breathing fumes from nail 
polishes that contain toluene, 
formaldehyde, or phthalates.
Nail polish removers
Nail polish removers 
are extremely 
flammable and can 
cause headaches, 
nausea, and 
dizziness.  
Keep Material Safety 
Data Sheets  
for nail salon  
products.  
DO NOT use any 
products that 
contain methyl 
methacrylate 
(MMA).  
Material Safety Data 
Sheets (MSDS) tell you 
about harmful chemicals in 
the products you use at work 
and how to protect yourself. 
Your employer must have an 
MSDS for each product that 
has harmful chemicals and 
must keep it where you can 
read it.

 What can you do to be safe at work?
Wash your hands, 
arms, and face with 
mild soap several 
times a day to 
clean off chemicals. 
Always wash your 
hands before you 
eat or smoke.
Don’t smoke 
or allow 
clients to 
smoke in 
the salon. 
Many salon 
products are 
flammable.
Wear safety glasses or 
goggles to protect your 
eyes from 
acrylic chips 
that can fly off when you 
remove artificial nails 
and from splashes when 
you use liquid chemicals. 
Wear thin vinyl 
or nitrile gloves  
and long sleeves 
to protect your 
skin from  
acrylic dust. 
Use a dispenser bottle 
that has a small opening — 
just large enough for the 
application brush to enter.  
Make sure that 
your salon has 
plenty of fresh 
air circulating 
so that you’re 
not exposed to 
chemical fumes. 
Use a table that has  
a built-in ventilating  
fan. The fan vents  
contaminated air outside  
the salon so that it doesn’t  
harm you or your customers.
When you are done with 
them, put chemical-soaked 
gauze pads in a metal can 
that has a tight-fitting lid. 
Don’t eat or drink at your work 
station. Chemicals and nail dust can 
get on your face and your food and 
cause skin rashes or other 
health problems if you 
swallow them.

Then, put 
them in 
the outside 
garbage at 
the end of 
the day. 
A dust mask protects 
your lungs from  
acrylic dust. 
Avoid latex gloves which can cause 
an allergic reaction in some people.
