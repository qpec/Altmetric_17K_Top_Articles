Abstract
Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of neonatal death worldwide1. Intrauterine and systemic 
infection and inflammation cause 30–40% of spontaneous preterm labor (PTL)2, which precedes 
PTB. Although antibody production is a major immune defense mechanism against infection, and 
B cell dysfunction has been implicated in pregnancy complications associated with PTL3,4, the 
functions of B cells in pregnancy are not well known5–8. We found that choriodecidua of women 
undergoing spontaneous PTL harbored functionally altered B cell populations. B cell–deficient 
mice were markedly more susceptible than wild-type (WT) mice to PTL after inflammation, but B 
cells conferred interleukin (IL)-10-independent protection against PTL. B cell deficiency in mice 
resulted in a lower uterine level of active progesterone-induced blocking factor 1 (PIBF1), and 
therapeutic administration of PIBF1 mitigated PTL and uterine inflammation in B cell–deficient 
mice. B cells are a significant producer of PIBF1 in human choriodecidua and mouse uterus in late 
gestation. PIBF1 expression by B cells is induced by the mucosal alarmin IL-33 (ref. 9). Human 
PTL was associated with diminished expression of the a-chain of IL-33 receptor on choriodecidual 
B cells and a lower level of active PIBF1 in late gestation choriodecidua. These results define a 
vital regulatory cascade involving IL-33, decidual B cells and PIBF1 in safeguarding term 
pregnancy and suggest new therapeutic approaches based on IL-33 and PIBF1 to prevent human 
PTL.
PTB, defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation in humans, affects 5–18% pregnancies 
worldwide and has remained an intractable cause of neonatal mortality and long-term 
morbidity1. Spontaneous PTL is an immediate predecessor to PTB in most cases1. 
Intrauterine and systemic infection and inflammation are recognized pathophysiologic 
mechanisms that account for 30–40% of this adverse clinical condition2. The host immune 
processes in infection- or inflammation-driven PTL and PTB remain unknown. Although 
antibody production by B cells is an important immune defense mechanism against mucosal 
and systemic infection, the function of B cells in pregnancy is poorly understood. B cells 
have long been considered to be rare or absent from the decidua5–8. Maternal B cells 
undergo substantial modifications during pregnancy10–13, presumably to assist the 
acceptance of a semi-allogeneic fetus, and B cell dysfunction has been implicated in 
pregnancy complications associated with PTL3,4. We hypothesized that B cells have a 
crucial role in regulating pregnancy, and sought to better define the host protective immune 
pathways against PTL.
By analyzing specimens of women with spontaneous term labor (TL) or PTL 
(Supplementary Table 1), we found that B cells were present in human choriodecidual 
stroma (Supplementary Fig. 1) and constituted approximately 1% and 2.5% of CD45+ cells 
in TL and PTL cases, respectively (Fig. 1a–c). Choriodecidual B cells exhibited a distinct 
phenotype from that of peripheral blood B cells, with higher expression of the activated,

 memory B cell–or plasma cell (PC)-associated molecules CD11c, CD27, CD38, CD70, 
CD80, CD86, CD95, CD138 and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), lower expression of 
CD23 and C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7), and a higher proportion of CD20lo, CD22lo, 
IgMlo and IgDlo cells (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), a profile that is suggestive of 
higher activation, class switching, memory and plasmacytoid differentiation, and is 
consistent with tissue residency. Choriodecidual B cells also expressed CCR6 and the 
integrins α4 and β7, but not CCR9, and only a little CCR10 (Supplementary Fig. 2b), which 
promote lymphocyte homing to intestine and skin-associated mucosal tissues, 
respectively14–16, indicating that B cell migration to choriodecidua involves nonoverlapping 
homing receptors from migration to other mucosal sites. Compared with TL choriodecidua, 
PTL choriodecidua harbored more B cells (Fig. 1a–c) and CD20+CD70−CD43+CD27+ cells 
(Fig. 1e–g), a population that has been postulated to be B-1 cells, which can spontaneously 
secrete autoreactive/polyreactive IgM17 and has been implicated in other adverse pregnancy 
outcomes3, and more CD24−CD38hi PCs (Fig. 1h–j). The expression of several direct or 
indirect B cell–stimulating molecules, including B cell–activating factor of the tumor 
necrosis factor family (BAFF), a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and thymic stromal 
lymphopoietin (TSLP)18,19, was higher in choriodecidual epithelial and/or stromal cells of 
PTL subjects than TL subjects (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b), which might underlie the 
expansion and higher activation of B cells in PTL choriodecidua. Collectively, human PTL 
choriodecidua harbored B cells with altered functions that were characterized by aberrant 
expansion, and higher activation and antibody production as compared with TL 
choriodecidua.
B cells produce IL-10 to suppress systemic and local inflammation20,21, and IL-10 is crucial 
for protection against inflammation-induced PTL in mice22,23. IL-10 expression was lower 
in choriodecidual B cells in PTL subjects than in TL subjects (Fig. 1k,l), although the total 
numbers of IL-10+ B cells were similar in TL and PTL choriodeciduas (Fig. 1m). To 
determine whether B cells protect against PTL triggered by inflammation, we compared the 
susceptibility of WT C57BL/6 mice and B cell–deficient µMT mice to PTL induced by 
administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on gestational day (gd) 16.5, a commonly used 
mouse model for human PTL triggered by systemic inflammation2. Although WT mice were 
relatively resistant to PTL and had a modest level of neonatal/fetal mortality after LPS 
administration, µMT mice experienced markedly higher rates of PTL and neonatal/fetal 
mortality (Fig. 2a,b), which were accompanied by higher induction of uterine 
proinflammatory mediators (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4a) and higher neutrophil 
infiltration into the uterus (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 4b,c). Neutrophils in the uterus 
of µMT mice exhibited heightened activation, including higher expression of CD11b, CD18, 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), major histocompatibility complex class II 
(MHC-II) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and lower expression of CD62L (Fig. 
2e and Supplementary Fig. 4d). The proportions of uterine CD11b+Ly-6C+ inflammatory 
monocytes were similar in WT and µMT mice (Supplementary Fig. 4e,f), and induction of 
Ccl2 was comparable in WT and µMT uteri (Supplementary Fig. 4g). Thus, B cells protect 
against PTL induced by inflammation in the third trimester in mice.

 To determine whether B cells confer protection against PTL by producing IL-10, we 
administered LPS on gd 16.5 to µMT mice that received either syngeneic WT or syngeneic 
Il10−/− B cells. Adoptive transfer of either WT or Il10−/− B cells restored the resistance of 
µMT mice to PTL (Fig. 2f), attenuated neonatal/fetal mortality (Fig. 2g) and suppressed 
uterine induction of pro-inflammatory mediators (Fig. 2h) and neutrophil infiltration (Fig. 
2i). Consistent with IL-10-independent protection, the uterus of µMT mice showed higher 
Il10 induction after LPS administration (Supplementary Fig. 5a). The induction of 
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)24,25 and IL-35 (refs. 26,27), which contains Epstein–
Barr-virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) as a subunit28, was similar in WT and µMT mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 5b). µMT mice that received WT or Il10−/− B cells also showed a 
similar induction of uterine Ebi3 after LPS administration as compared to µMT mice that did 
not receive B cells (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Collectively, these data argue against a 
substantial role of IL-10, TGF-β or IL-35 in B cell–mediated protection against PTL.
Given that progesterone is important to the maintenance of term pregnancy29, we asked 
whether B cells are effectors in progesterone-mediated immune regulation in late pregnancy. 
The progesterone-inducible molecule PIBF1 carries out many effector functions of 
progesterone in pregnancy30, and a lower serum concentration of PIBF1 in late pregnancy is 
associated with an increased risk of human PTL31. Full-length 90-kDa PIBF1 is a nucleus- 
or centrosome-associated protein32, whereas several alternatively spliced shorter isoforms, 
including the 35-, 48-, 57- and 67-kDa isoforms, can be secreted by certain tumor cells and 
by immune cells and trophoblasts during pregnancy, and are biologically active32–34. As 
compared with WT mice, µMT mice showed much lower active PIBF1 expression in late 
gestation uterus (Fig. 3a) and defective induction of uterine Pibf1 transcript after LPS 
administration (Fig. 3b). However, WT and µMT mice had similar serum progesterone 
concentrations after LPS administration (Fig. 3c). Transfer of WT or Il10−/− B cells to µMT 
mice resulted in higher uterine active PIBF1 expression after LPS administration (Fig. 3d,e). 
These results suggest that B cells are an important source of active PIBF1 in mouse uterus in 
late pregnancy. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence further revealed that mouse uterine 
B cells expressed PIBF1 during mid- and late gestation (Fig. 3f), and human choriodecidual 
B cells also expressed PIBF1 during late gestation (Fig. 3g,h and Supplementary Fig. 6a). 
PIBF1 in choriodecidual B cells was both concentrated perinuclearly and distributed in the 
cytoplasm (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Fig. 6b), consistent with the localization of 
centrosome-associated and secretory PIBF1, respectively33. Of note, B cells were the cell 
population with the highest PIBF1 expression in mouse uterus (Supplementary Fig. 7a−d) 
and human choriodecidua (Supplementary Fig. 8a−d). Furthermore, human peripheral blood 
CD19+ B cells contained more full-length and active PIBF1 protein than other peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and PBMCs depleted of B cells were almost devoid of 
full-length and active PIBF1 (Supplementary Fig. 8e). Thus, B cells are an important source 
of active PIBF1 in human choriodecidua and mouse uterus during late pregnancy.
To test whether B cell–mediated protection against PTL involves PIBF1 and whether 
therapeutic delivery of PIBF1 can promote resistance to PTL, we administered either 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or recombinant human full-length PIBF1 (fPIBF1) to µMT 
mice before LPS challenge. As compared to PBS administration, fPIBF1 administration

 significantly lowered the rates of LPS-induced preterm delivery and neonatal/fetal mortality 
(Fig. 3j,k), suppressed uterine induction of proinflammatory mediators (Fig. 3l and 
Supplementary Fig. 9a) and inhibited neutrophil infiltration into the uterus (Fig. 3m,n). 
Uterine neutrophils exhibited lower activation in fPIBF1-treated versus PBS-treated mice 
after LPS challenge, with lower expression of CD11b, CD18, iNOS, ICAM-1 and MHC-II, 
and higher expression of CD62L (Fig. 3o and Supplementary Fig. 9b). Administration of a 
recombinant C-terminal fragment of PIBF1 (cPIBF1) (Supplementary Fig. 10a) neither 
mitigated PTL or neonatal/fetal death (Supplementary Fig. 10b,c) nor suppressed uterine 
neutrophil infiltration or activation triggered by LPS (Supplementary Fig. 10d,e). Thus, 
supplementation of PIBF1 promotes resistance to LPS-induced PTL in µMT mice, and the 
protective activity of PIBF1 resides in its N terminus.
We further sought to understand the regulation of PIBF1 expression by B cells and tested a 
panel of cytokines known to modulate B cell function. We performed quantitative real-time 
PCR and western blot analyses and found that IL-33 promoted PIBF1 expression by human 
peripheral blood B cells, similar to progesterone35 (Fig. 4a,b). By contrast, interferon-γ 
(IFN-γ), IL-17A, IL-10 and TGF-β had no effect, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) had a 
suppressive effect (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Of note, among the T helper type 2 (TH2) 
cytokines tested, including IL-4, IL-25, TSLP and IL-33, only IL-33 induced PIBF1 
expression by human B cells (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Indeed, human peripheral blood or 
choriodecidual B cells did not express the receptors for IL-25 or TSLP (Supplementary Fig. 
11b). PIBF1 expression by mouse uterine B cells during late pregnancy was also dependent 
on IL-33, as PIBF1 was diminished in the uteri and uterine B cells of Il33−/− mice in late 
gestation (Fig. 4c,d and Supplementary Fig. 12a–d). Consistently, mouse uterine PIBF1 level 
did not decrease during progesterone withdrawal in late pregnancy (Supplementary Fig. 
13a,b). Thus, PIBF1 expression in mouse late gestation was maintained largely by IL-33 
rather than progesterone.
IL-33 is a mucosal alarmin that signals tissue damage following stress or infection9, and that 
can induce immune cells with regulatory functions to maintain tissue homeostasis36–40. 
Given that uterine stress and infection are causally linked to human PTL2, we asked whether 
human PTL encompasses defects in this protective pathway involving IL-33, decidual B 
cells and PIBF1. Although human peripheral blood and choriodecidual B cells constitutively 
expressed the β-chain of IL-33 receptor (IL-33R), interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein 
(IL1RAcP; Supplementary Fig. 14a−c), the expression of the IL-33R α-chain, interleukin-1 
receptor-like 1 (ST2L), was significantly lower on choriodecidual B cells in PTL subjects 
than in TL subjects (Fig. 4e–i). PIBF1 expression in choriodecidua and choriodecidual B 
cells of subjects with PTL was concomitantly diminished (Fig. 4h–j). The lower expression 
of PIBF1 or ST2L on choriodecidual B cells was unlikely to be a result of a lower 
choriodecidual progesterone level, because TL and PTL choriodecidual tissues contained 
similar levels of progesterone at delivery (Supplementary Fig. 15a). Consistently, 
progesterone treatment did not lead to higher ST2L expression on cultured human B cells 
(Supplementary Fig. 15b). Thus, human PTL is associated with defects in IL-33 
responsiveness of and PIBF1 production by choriodecidual B cells independently of 
progesterone.

 Taken together, our findings reveal an axis of B cell–mediated immune regulation that 
involves IL-33-dependent expression of PIBF1 and uncover a long-neglected, but vital, role 
of B cells in safeguarding term pregnancy that is defective in PTL (Fig. 4k). Of note, 
although PIBF1 is recognized as a progesterone-induced molecule, our findings indicate that 
B cell–derived PIBF1 goes beyond being a progesterone effector molecule and has an 
important role in promoting tissue homeostasis in response to tissue stress independently of 
progesterone. The identification of this B cell–mediated protective pathway suggests new 
therapeutic strategies involving IL-33 and PIBF1 for the prevention and treatment of human 
PTL.
ONLINE METHODS
Study subjects
Women who underwent spontaneous TL (37–41 weeks of gestation) or spontaneous PTL 
(between 32–37 weeks of gestation) (Supplementary Table 1) were enrolled in this study 
with written informed consent at Oakwood Hospital of Beaumont Healthcare System and 
the affiliated hospitals of the Detroit Medical Center (DMC) under protocols approved by 
the Institutional Review Board of Wayne State University, Oakwood Hospital and the DMC. 
Subjects with a current diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, a prior history or current diagnosis of 
diabetes, chronic hypertension, asthma, thyroid disease, pyelonephritis, active chlamydia, 
gonorrhea or syphilis infections, active HPV or HSV lesions, HIV infection and/or 
recreational drug use were excluded.
Human blood and tissue samples
Placentas and the attached chorioamniotic membranes were obtained after delivery. In each 
case, several random strips of the chorioamniotic membranes located at different regions of 
the choriodecidua were embedded in rolls in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound 
(Sakura Finetek 4583), frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for 
immunofluorescence analysis. Choriodecidual tissues were scraped from the chorionic 
membranes that had blood clots removed, and digested with 0.2% (w/v) Clostridium 
histolyticum collagenase V (Sigma-Aldrich C9263) in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific 26140-079) at 37 °C with gentle agitation for 45 min. Cells released from 
the tissues were cleaned by being passed through a 100-µm cell strainer and centrifuged on a 
Ficoll gradient. Peripheral blood leukocytes of anonymous healthy donors after 
leukophoresis were obtained from the Southeast Michigan branch of American Red Cross 
with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Wayne State University and 
the DMC. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using 
Histopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich 10771) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Red 
blood cells were lysed using an ammonium-chloride-potassium lysing buffer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific A1049201). IgD+ B cells were purified from PBMCs by magnetic-activated cell 
sorting with a biotinylated goat F(ab′)2 anti-human IgD antibody and anti-biotin magnetic 
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec), as previously reported41. The purity of the IgD+ B cells 
ranged from 92–99% as determined by flow cytometry with CD19 staining. CD19+ B cells 
were similarly separated from PBMCs using a biotinylated mouse anti-human CD19 (clone

 HIB19) antibody, with purity ranging from 93–97% as determined by flow cytometry using 
a different clone (SJ25C1) of CD19 antibody.
Mice
C57BL/6 mice (Jackson stock number 000664), Balb/c mice (Jackson stock number 
000651), µMT (B6.129S2-Ighmtm1Cgn, Jackson stock number 002288) and Il10−/− 
(B6.129P2-Il10tm1Cgn, Jackson stock number 002251) mice in C57BL/6 background were 
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. Il33−/− lacZ reporter mice in the C57BL/6 
background were generated by the mouse core of the NIH/NIAID Mucosal Immunology 
Studies Team at Washington University School of Medicine. All mice were maintained in 
the same specific-pathogen-free facility of the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources of 
Wayne State University. All protocols were approved by Wayne State University 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Mouse models of preterm labor
6–10-week-old virgin female C57BL/6 (WT) or µMT mice were mated with male Balb/c 
mice. Female mice were examined daily in the early morning for the presence of a vaginal 
plug, which denoted gd 0.5. In the late morning of gd 16.5, pregnant female mice were 
intraperitoneally administered with 200 µl of sterile PBS or 200 µl of sterile PBS containing 
0.5, 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 µg LPS from Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium (Sigma-Aldrich 
L6143). The various doses of LPS were assigned to the mice randomly. In some 
experiments, splenic B cells of 5–8-week-old virgin female WT or Il10−/− mice were 
purified using a mouse resting B cell negative isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec 130-090-862) to 
94–99% purity as determined by CD19 staining. 107 purified B cells were adoptively 
transferred in 200 µl sterile PBS into pregnant female µMT mice on gd 14.5 before LPS 
administration on gd 16.5. In some other experiments, 200 µl sterile PBS or 200 µl sterile 
PBS containing 1 µg recombinant full-length PIBF1 (fPIBF1) (aa 1–755, with an N-terminal 
glutathione-S-transferase (GST) tag, Abnova H00010464-P01) or 300 ng of a recombinant 
C-terminal fragment of PIBF1 (cPIBF1) (aa 660–755, with an N-terminal glutathione-S-
transferase (GST) tag, Abnova H00010464-Q01) was intravenously administered to 
pregnant female µMT mice on gd 16.5 3 h before intraperitoneal LPS administration. 24 h 
after LPS administration, female mice were examined for delivery and death of delivered 
pups if delivery occurred. They were then killed for the examination of neonatal/fetal 
mortality, which was calculated as the total number of dead delivered pups and dead fetuses 
divided by the total number of implantation sites. Uteri were collected, briefly washed in 
PBS and processed for RNA and protein extraction or flow cytometry. The people 
performing the analysis were not blinded to the genotype or treatment of the mice.
Cell culture
Human PMBCs, IgD+ B cells, CD19+ B cells or PBMCs depleted of CD19+ B cells were 
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich R8578) supplemented with 2 mM L-
glutamine, 2 mg/ml NaHCO3, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 µg/ml 
amphotericin B and 10% FBS. Cells were stimulated with 1 µM progesterone (Sigma-
Aldrich P0130), or 100 ng/ml IL-33 (R&D 3625-IL-010 or Peprotech 200-33), IL-4 
(Peprotech 200-04), IL-10 (Peprotech 200-10), IL-17A (Peprotech 200-17), IL-25 (R&D

(R&D 240-B-010/CF), or 50 ng/ml TNF (210-TA-020). RNA or protein expression was 
analyzed after 3 d. The primary cell cultures were not tested for mycoplasma infection.
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
RNA was extracted from cells or tissues using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific 15596026). 
cDNA synthesis was performed using the Superscript III first-strand synthesis system 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific 188080051) in a thermocycler (Bio-Rad T100). Quantitative real-
time PCR was performed with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific 4367660) in a StepOnePlus instrument (Applied Biosystems) using pairs of sense 
and anti-sense primers targeted at the genes of interest (Supplementary Table 2).
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
Cells were incubated with an Fc blocking reagent and stained at 4 °C with antibodies to 
various cell surface antigens (Supplementary Table 3). For staining of intracellular 
molecules, cells were subsequently fixed and permeabilized using a CytoFix/CytoPerm kit 
(BD 554722). Isotype-matched control antibodies were used to define the baseline staining 
for the molecules of interest. Cells or beads stained with each fluorochrome were used to 
establish fluorescent compensation. 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD, Tonbo Biosciences 
13-6993-T500 or BD Biosciences 559925) or Ghost Dye Violet 510 (Tonbo Biosciences 
13-0870-T500) was used to identify dead cells in order to exclude them from the analysis. 
Events were acquired on an LSR II, LSRFortessa or FACSCanto II cytometer (BD 
Biosciences) and analyzed by FlowJo (Tree Star). In some experiments, stained cells were 
sorted using a SONY SH800 or SY3200 cell sorter (SONY Biotechnology).
Imaging flow cytometry
Choriodecidual cell suspensions were incubated with an Fc blocking reagent and stained at 
4 °C with antibodies to various surface antigens, fixed and permeabilized, and stained for 
PIBF1 or with an isotype control antibody, followed by a fluorochrome-conjugated 
secondary antibody (Supplementary Table 3). Nuclei were counter stained with Hoechst 
33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific 62249). Cells or beads stained with each fluorochrome 
were used to establish fluorescent compensation. Cells were imaged on an ImageStream X 
Mark II imaging flow cytometer (Amnis) and data were analyzed using IDEAS 6.1 (Amnis).
Immunohistochemistry
Frozen human tissues were stored at −80 °C shortly before sectioning. 6–7-µm tissue 
sections were made using a cryostat (Leica CM1950). Sections were fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with PBS 
containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 100 µg/ml human IgG. Endogenous 
biotin was subsequently blocked with an Avidin/Biotin blocking kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific 004303). The tissues were stained with primary antibodies against target antigens 
isotype control antibodies from the same company with the same conjugation, if the primary 
antibody is conjugated followed by alkaline-phosphatase- or horseradish-peroxidase-
conjugated secondary antibodies (Supplementary Table 3). Single-color reactions were

whereas dual-color reactions were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/
nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma-Aldrich B5655) and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma-
Aldrich AEC101) as substrates. Nuclei were visualized with hematoxylin on single-color 
slides. Slides were imaged using an Olympus BX40 or Nikon TE-2000 microscope with 
CellSens Dimension software.
Immunofluorescence
Frozen human tissues were stored at −80 °C shortly before sectioning. 6–7-µm tissue 
sections were made using a cryostat (Leica CM1950). Sections were fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with PBS 
containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 100 µg/ml human IgG and 10% serum 
from the source of the fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies, and stained with various 
combinations of primary antibodies against the molecules of interest, followed by 
appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (Supplementary Table 3). Nuclei 
were visualized with 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Sigma-
Aldrich D9542). Following washing, slides were mounted using a FluoroSave reagent (EMD 
Millipore 345789) and imaged using a confocal microscope. Pseudocolor images were 
processed using Photoshop (Adobe).
Protein extraction and western blot
Cells were pelleted and washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in a pH 8.0 protein extraction 
buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich 
I8896), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mM EDTA and protease and phosphatase 
inhibitor cocktail on ice for 30 min. For protein extraction from mouse uterus and human 
chorioamniotic membranes, the tissue was washed twice with PBS to remove blood and 
homogenized in the above protein-extraction buffer with a tissue tearor (Biospec Products 
985370), followed by three rounds of sonication at 30% maximum power for 5 s per round 
using a sonifier (Thermo Fisher Scientific Q500). Supernatants were collected after 
centrifugation, heated at 98 °C in an SDS buffer with 4% β-mecaptoethanol for 5 min to 
denature proteins. Proteins were resolved in 4–20% Bis-Tris gels (GenScript M42012) and 
transferred to 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad 1620115). The membranes were 
blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 for 30 min, 
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and subsequently with secondary 
antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Supplementary Table 3). Signals were 
visualized with clarity western-blot ECL substrate (Bio-Rad 170-5061) and exposed on 
autoradiograph films. Cropped blot images were shown in the figures, with full-length blots 
shown in the supplementary information.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Progesterone levels in sera and tissues were determined using an ELISA kit (Cayman 
Chemical 582601) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

 Statistical analysis
The sample size was calculated on the basis of the effect size derived from preliminary data 
at 5% significance level and 80% power using the software G*Power 3.1. Sample 
availability exceeded the estimated sample size. Results are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. 
Percentage data were subjected to square-root transformation before statistical analysis to 
verify test assumptions of equal variance. Statistical difference in the rate of PTL between 
different strains of mice or different treatment groups was assessed by Fisher’s exact test. 
Statistical difference in neonatal/fetal mortality was assessed by Mann–Whitney U test. For 
flow cytometry and RT–qPCR data, Shapiro–Wilk test was used to determine the normality 
of the data. Statistical significance was assessed by Student’s t test for normally distributed 
data and Mann–Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data. P < 0.05 was considered 
to be statistically significant.

subjects. (k) A proposed model of choriodecidual-B-cell-mediated protection against PTL 
via IL-33-induced expression of PIBF1. B cell migration to choriodecidua in pregnancy may 
be mediated by signals involving α4 and β7 integrins. In response to choriodecidual IL-33, 
an alarmin that is released following uterine stress, inflammation and infection, 
choriodecidual B cells produce PIBF1 to suppress premature parturition, likely via the 
inhibition of the production of labor-inducing factors, natural killer (NK) cell activity, 
neutrophil infiltration and activation, and the production of proinflammatory mediators30. 
Thus, IL-33, choriodecidual B cells and PIBF1 constitute a protective axis to promote term 
pregnancy by counteracting uterine stress, inflammation and infection. In PTL, 
choriodecidual B cells undergo aberrant expansion, increased activation and differentiation 
into plasma cells or B-1 cells, and secrete antibodies that can trigger labor-inducing 
inflammatory cascades, such as complement and neutrophil activation. Furthermore, the 
protective axis involving IL-33, choriodecidual B cells and PIBF1 is defective in PTL, likely 
as a result of the aberrant downregulation of ST2L on choriodecidual B cells. *P < 0.05, **P 
< 0.01, ***P < 0.001, by two-tailed t test (a,j) or two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test (f,g).
