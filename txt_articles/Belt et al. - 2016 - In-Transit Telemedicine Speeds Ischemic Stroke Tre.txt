ore rapid treatment of ischemic stroke1–3 improves out-
comes. Because improved in-hospital processes have 
reduced door-to-needle (DTN) time,4 focus has shifted to 
prehospital time.5–8 Emergency medical services’ (EMS) iden-
tification of likely strokes helps,9,10 and in-ambulance teleneur-
ology has been considered but not tested clinically.11,12 Mobile 
stroke transport units (MSTUs), computed tomographic 
scanner–equipped ambulances with a neurologist, either in 
person or by telemedicine,8 to assess thrombolytic appro-
priateness and oversee treatment, in the prehospital setting, 
decrease treatment time 25 minutes.5,8 However, MSTUs cost 
US$0.75M to $1.4M5 and require a computed tomographic 
technologist, an emergency medical technician, and a licensed 
healthcare practitioner to administer medication, incurring 
operating costs that can exceed US$1M/y. Consequently, 
centers use a single MSTU with limited access hours; several 
operate alternate weeks.5,6
Time to treatment can be reduced by performing assess-
ments either before (MSTU) or during patient transport. 
Time saved must be balanced against additional time needed 
for specialized units to reach patients; for this reason, the 
Berlin group chose a 16-minute radius from the MSTU’s 
base.5 This limits the number of patients treated, ≈1/week in 
Cleveland, 1 every 2 operating days in Berlin. During times 
the Berlin unit was functioning, 44% of patients needing 
alteplase could not be served because of unit unavailabil-
ity; consequently, the population average savings were 15 
minutes/patient.
We, therefore, tested the feasibility of using teleneurology 
for patients in transit in ambulances. Our goal was to develop 
a practical, affordable, scalable prehospital approach, provid-
ing more rapid care to more patients at lower cost.
Methods
Atlantic Health System, a not-for-profit multihospital system in sub-
urban New Jersey, includes Overlook Medical Center (OMC), a Joint 
Commission–certified Comprehensive Stroke Center, and Chilton 
Medical Center (CMC), a Primary Stroke Center. OMC provides 24/7 
telestroke coverage to 6 emergency departments (EDs), including 
CMC. The current study was piloted at OMC and CMC, selected for 
well-functioning ED telestroke systems (DTN <60 minutes in >85% 
of patients at both) and an EMS structure facilitating implementation.
New Jersey’s EMS is organized in a 2-tiered system. More than 
500 Basic Life Support (BLS) units, mostly town volunteer squads, 
act as 911 first responders and transport patients in their ambulances. 
The state’s 22 advanced life support (ALS) units, staffed by paramed-
ics, each work with many BLS units and are called to life-threatening 
emergencies and strokes, as dictated by 911 dispatch protocols. ALS 
units cover defined geographies. When involved, ALS paramedic 
units join BLS crews at the scene, then accompany patients to the 
Background and Purpose—Time to treatment is critically important in ischemic stroke. We compared the efficacy and cost 
of teleneurology evaluation during patient transport with that of mobile stroke transport units.
Methods—Using cellular-connected telemedicine devices, we assessed 89 presumptive stroke patients in ambulances in 
transit. Paramedics assisted remote teleneurologists in obtaining a simplified history and examination, then coordinating 
care with the receiving emergency department. We prospectively assessed door-to-needle and last-known-well-to-needle 
times for all intravenous alteplase–treated stroke patients brought to our emergency departments by emergency medical 
services’ transport, comparing those with and without in-transit telestroke.
Results—From January 2015 through March 2016, 111 stroke patients received intravenous alteplase at study emergency 
departments. Mean door to needle was 13 minutes less with in-transit telestroke (28 versus 41; P=0.02). Although 
limitations in cellular communication degraded transmission quality, this did not prevent the completion of satisfactory 
patient evaluations.
Conclusions—Improvement in time to treat seems comparable with in-transit telestroke and mobile stroke transport units. 
The low cost/unit makes this approach scalable, potentially providing rapid management of more patients.

ED. The 2 Atlantic Health System ALS units serving OMC work with 
11 BLS units covering a population of 300 000. The 2 serving CMC 
partner with 10 BLS units covers a population of 160 000.
Each of these 4 ALS units was provided an InTouch Xpress device, 
a portable unit incorporating a high-definition camera, microphone, 
and screen allowing transparent bidirectional communication. Units 
cost ≈$23 000; annual connectivity and maintenance costs <$10 000 
each. Units are easily clamped onto BLS ambulance stretchers 
and images transmitted by 4G wireless during patient transport. 
Atlantic Health System paramedics, trained for neurological emer-
gencies in accordance with the Paramedic National Curriculum, in 
the Cincinnati Stroke Scale, and in Xpress device use, determined 
patient eligibility, then collaborated with the stroke teleneurologist 
in performing the neurological evaluation. In the ED, the stroke team 
(OMC: in person, normal working hours; teleneurologist, after hours; 
CMC: teleneurologist), typically with the same stroke neurologist 
performing in-ambulance assessment, assumed care.
From January 2015 through March 2016, all patients managed by 
these 4 ALS units, with an abnormal Cincinnati Stroke Scale or oth-
erwise suspected stroke, brought to these 2 EDs, were assessed with 
in-transit telestroke (ITTS). We compared DTN and last-known-well 
to needle (LKWTN) times in this group with all other intravenous 
alteplase–treated stroke patients brought to these 2 EDs by EMS. 
Twenty-five treated walk-in stroke patients were excluded. Analysis 
was intention to treat; patients with failed ITTS were included in the 
telestroke group.
Statistical analyses were performed with StatPlus for Mac 
(AnalystSoft Inc, version 6). Prespecified primary outcome measures 
were the differences in DTN and LKWTN times between these 2 
groups.
Results
Eighty-nine patients with suspected strokes were evaluated 
by ITTS. There were no misses; all alteplase-treated strokes 
brought to the OMC ED by these 2 U had ITTS. Mean telecon-
sult duration was 7.3 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI], 
4.9–9.8) among the 15 (17%) receiving alteplase, 4.7 minutes 
(95% CI, 3.9–5.4) among the 74 who did not. Although 39% 
of teleconsults required reconnection, connectivity was rapidly 
reestablished in all but 2; in all but these 2, the teleneurologist 
felt the clinical evaluation was satisfactory. During this same 
period, 71 alteplase-treated stroke patients were transported to 
OMC and CMC by EMS without Atlantic Health System para-
medic units. Patient demographics were similar for the 2 groups 
(Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). Mean DTN time 
(Table 1) was 28 minutes (95% CI, 23–35) in ITTS patients, 
41 in controls (95% CI, 36–47; P=0.02). Mean LKWTN time 
was 30 minutes less, 92 with ITTS (95% CI, 69–115), and 122 
without (n=71; 95% CI, 109–135; P=0.037; Mann–Whitney 
U test). Among patients with known ambulance scene arrival 
time, mean patient transport time (scene arrival to ED arrival) 
was 29 minutes with ITTS, 34 without (not significant); control

patients were transported a somewhat greater distance (Table 
I in the online-only Data Supplement). Time from LKW to 
ambulance on-scene arrival was 31 minutes for ITTS patients, 
50 for others. Although not statistically significant, at least 
partly because of incomplete data, this did contribute to 
shorter overall LKWTN time.
On post hoc exploratory analyses (Table 2), time saving was 
greater with ITTS than with EMS ED prenotification with-
out ITTS (P=0.04). Among non-ITTS patients evaluated by 
telemedicine in the OMC ED (n=36), DTN was 12 minutes 
longer than with in-person assessment (n=48; P<0.001). This 
difference all but disappeared when ITTS and ED telemedi-
cine were combined.
Among the 15 treated ITTS patients, the only alteplase-
related complication was a postfall pneumohemothorax, 
which resolved with a chest tube. There were no symptom-
atic intracerebral hemorrhages. Three had normal diffusion-
weighted magnetic resonance imaging after treatment, as did 
17 non-ITTS patients, suggesting either a transient ischemic 
attack or complete resolution of the arterial obstruction. Other 
than 2 patients subsequently found to have seizures, all others 
were judged to have strokes (Table 1).
Discussion
Our pilot data indicate that mean DTN time can be shortened 
13 minutes using ITTS for clinical assessment and prelimi-
nary management, comparable with the population estimate 
of 15 minutes with MSTUs.5,8 Acceptance among patients 
and EMS has been uniformly positive. There are obvious 
challenges examining patients restrained on stretchers in 
moving vehicles, and maintaining cellular connectivity, but 
neither precluded obtaining useful information. Perhaps 
most telling was the preferential time saving when telemed-
icine was used both in transit and ED, eliminating the time 
disadvantage inherent in telestroke. We presume that hav-
ing the same neurologist assessing the patient in both sites 
allows more time for the relevant thought processes and ini-
tiation of needed additional steps to give alteplase. Whether 
the 23% normal post–alteplase magnetic resonance imaging 
reflects the efficacy of rapid treatment or difficulty iden-
tifying transient ischemic attacks as DTN gets so short is 
an important question as more hospitals achieve DTN <45 
minutes.
Although confirmation in a larger study will be essential, 
our preliminary observations suggest that ITTS may provide a 
scalable, inexpensive alternative to MSTUs, with comparably 
expeditious treatment.
