ABSTRACT: 
 
Descriptive studies have suggested that the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) health insurance 
Marketplaces improved access to care.  However, no quasi-experimental evidence is currently 
available to support these findings.  We use longitudinal survey data to compare previously-
uninsured adults to adults who had employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) prior to the ACA, in the 
income range eligible for subsidized Marketplace coverage (138-400% of poverty).  Among the 
previously-uninsured group, the ACA led to a significant decline in the uninsurance rate (-10.8 
percentage points), decreased barriers to medical care, increased use of outpatient services and 
prescriptions drugs, and increased identification of high blood pressure, compared to a control 
group with stable ESI.  Changes were largest among those with incomes between 138-250% of 
poverty, who were eligible for the ACA’s cost-sharing reductions.  Our quasi-experimental 
approach provides rigorous new evidence that the ACA’s Marketplaces led to improvements in 
several important health care outcomes, particularly among lower-income adults.   
 
  
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Evidence on the effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) continues to grow, even as the 
likely elimination of the individual mandate penalty and ongoing political debate has made its 
future impact uncertain.  Numerous studies have examined impacts of the Medicaid 
expansion,(1-3) whereas less research has focused on the ACA’s health insurance Marketplaces. 
The Marketplaces offer subsidized coverage to families with incomes between 138-400% 
of poverty (100-400% in states that did not expand Medicaid), and provide cost-sharing 
reductions for those with incomes below 250%. 6.7 million people purchased insurance through 
ACA Marketplaces in the first open enrollment period spanning from October of 2013 to March 
of 2014,(4) and  10.3 million had done so by 2017.(5) One study estimated that subsidized 
Marketplace coverage accounted for 40% of the ACA’s reduction in the uninsured rate.(6) 
The Marketplaces were designed to improve affordability and accessibility of health care 
for low- and middle-income populations.  In addition to premium and cost-sharing subsidies, the 
ACA also abolished annual and lifetime limits, mandated that insurance plans cover a set of 
“essential health benefits,” and outlawed pre-existing condition exclusions.(7)  Observational 
studies have shown substantial increases in coverage among those eligible for Marketplace 
subsidies,(8-10) increased likelihood of having a usual source of care and access to 
medications,(11) and increased rates of blood pressure screening.(12, 13)  However, to our 
knowledge, there has been no quasi-experimental evidence on the Marketplaces’ impact.  
Rigorous evaluations of changes in coverage and access in the Marketplace-eligible income 
range are needed, particularly because higher cost-sharing requirements(14) and narrow 
networks in Marketplace plans(15) may limit the generalizability of evidence from the ACA’s 
Medicaid expansion.  Finally, observational analyses of people gaining Marketplace coverage 
  
 
that do not include a control group run the risk of multiple forms of bias – including secular 
trends in health outcomes, the economic recovery, and selective enrollment among a subset of 
eligible applicants. 
Our study assessed the impact of newly-available Marketplace coverage on previously-
uninsured non-elderly adults who became eligible for subsidized Marketplace plans in 2014.   
Using longitudinal survey data, we performed a difference-in-differences analysis comparing 
health and spending outcomes among those who were uninsured prior the ACA to a cohort of 
adults with stable employer-sponsored insurance in the income range eligible for subsidized 
Marketplace coverage. 
 
METHODS  
Data: We analyzed data from the nationally-representative Medical Expenditure Panel 
Survey (MEPS).  Data is collected for each member of surveyed households over a two-year 
period and is available in two-year, longitudinal datasets (for simplicity, we refer below to the 
first and second years of data as Year 1 and Year 2 for each observation).(16)  We used three 
longitudinal data sets: 2011-2012; 2012-2013; and 2013-2014 (Appendix A).  We began our 
study period in 2011 since earlier datasets would be potentially subject to changes related to the 
Great Recession, as well as the immediate effects of the ACA’s dependent coverage provision, 
which took effect beginning in 2010.   The 2013-2014 data set captures the implementation of 
major ACA policies on January 1, 2014.  The 2013-2014 panel was the cohort in which the 
intervention took place, the “ACA-affected cohort,” while the panels from 2011-2012 and 2012-
2013 were combined to form a pre-ACA cohort.  
Study Design and Sample: 
  
 
Our study used a difference-in-differences analysis, measuring changes in health 
insurance coverage, access to care, utilization, and costs before and after 2014 in an intervention 
group compared to a control group.    
Our intervention group was comprised of adults aged 18-63 with Year 1 family incomes 
between 138 and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), who were uninsured for 6 months or 
more in Year 1.  Family income was defined based on concept of the health-insurance unit (an 
adult, his/her spouse, and any dependent children).  Most individuals in this group (subject to the 
limitations discussed below) became eligible to purchase premium-subsidized insurance on state 
health insurance Marketplaces in 2014, and those with incomes below 250% also qualified for 
cost-sharing reductions.  We chose six months of uninsurance as our cut-off to capture the 
longer-term uninsured population, as opposed to individuals who had brief gaps in coverage due 
to job changes or temporary fluctuations in income.   
The control group consisted of non-elderly adults with incomes between 138-400% of 
poverty who were insured with employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) for all twelve months of 
Year 1.  Although there is no perfect control group for the creation of the ACA Marketplaces, 
previous research demonstrates that the ACA had little detectable effects on ESI, indicating that 
this group was largely insulated from changes affecting our treatment group,(17-19) making it a 
useful comparator to account for potential secular trends in the economy and the health care 
system.   
   
Outcome Variables:  
Our sample was defined based on Year 1 features (age, income, and insurance status).  
All outcome measures were drawn from Year 2 of the datasets.  
  
 
Our primary coverage outcome was health insurance status as of the last month of Year 2.  
Insurance type is self-reported in the MEPS.  Categories of insurance included private employer-
sponsored insurance; non-group private insurance (including Marketplace coverage); Medicaid; 
and uninsured. As a secondary outcome, we also measured the total number of insured months in 
Year 2.   
Access to care outcomes (again based on Year 2) were self-reported inability to access 
medical care; delays in obtaining prescription medications; and access to a usual source of care.  
Utilization measures were Year 2 receipt of a preventive health visit; number of outpatient visits; 
number of ER visits; number of prescription medications used (including refills); presence of any 
inpatient admission; receipt of a blood pressure check; and laboratory testing for cholesterol 
levels.  We also assessed changes in prevalence of year 2 diagnosis rates of several common 
chronic conditions: hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes.  
Cost-related outcomes were Year 2 total spending and out-of-pocket spending.  Total 
spending is the sum of expenditures by all payers, including out-of-pocket payments, for all 
health care services excluding over-the-counter medication.(20)  Out-of-pocket spending 
includes all payments made by individuals for outpatient visits, inpatient admissions, emergency 
room visits, and prescription drugs.(21)  MEPS cost data are independently-verified whenever 
possible with providers of medical services and pharmacies.(16, 22)  To account for the skewed 
distribution of spending data, we analyzed these outcomes with a two-stage model.  First, we 
modeled changes in the proportion of those with any health expenses, and second, we analyzed 
changes in the logarithm of spending among those with any expenditures.  All spending figures 
were adjusted to 2014 dollars using the consumer price index.(23) 
 
  
 
Statistical Analysis:  
We used linear regression models for both binary and non-binary outcomes for ease of 
interpretation.(24)  Our models adjusted for key demographic characteristics and economic 
indicators (all from Year 1) including age, sex, race, region, marital status, family size, birthplace 
outside the U.S., family income, and employment status.  All models included two binary 
indicators: previously-uninsured (intervention) vs. previously-insured via stable ESI (control) 
group; and pre- vs. post-ACA cohort.  The interaction term between these two variables yielded 
our difference-in-difference estimate.   
 
 In a subgroup analysis, we divided our study population by income: a low-income group 
(family income 138-250% of poverty), which was eligible for both premium subsidies and cost-
sharing reductions through Marketplace plans, and a middle-income group (251-400% of 
poverty), eligible only for premium-cost assistance. 
Our primary analysis defined income based on the health insurance unit, but we also 
conducted a sensitivity analysis using the less-restrictive MEPS definition for family income.(21) 
We tested for diverging trends prior to 2014 for our treatment and control group.  This 
analysis used a placebo difference-in-difference model as if the ACA had been implemented in 
2013,(25) comparing study outcomes between the previously-uninsured group and the stable-ESI 
group in the 2011-2012 vs. the 2012-2013 panel.   
All regressions were performed with SAS (Version 9.4) using survey-based procedures 
that accounted for the complex sample design and weights in the MEPS.   
 
Limitations:  
  
 
Our study was subject to several limitations.  This study includes only a single year of 
post-ACA data and therefore captures only the first-year effects of the Marketplaces.  The 
ACA’s effects would be expected to increase after the first year given that enrollment continued 
to rise(26) and recipients would have more time to take advantage of newly-acquired benefits.  
Changes in some outcomes, especially self-reported health status, may not apparent in the first 
year.(27)  The use of only a single post-ACA year was unavoidable given our study design, 
which relied on two-year longitudinal data from MEPS and specifically exploited the single 
cohort that overlapped the launch of the ACA’s major policies.  We feel that this tradeoff is 
worthwhile given the strength of our study design compared to prior Marketplace-specific 
analyses. 
Although the MEPS is a relatively large dataset, our inclusion criteria resulted in smaller 
study sample.  This may have limited our power to detect small changes that may be clinically or 
economically relevant, and also precluded analyzing outcomes that were relevant only to a small 
subset of our sample, such as mammography or pap smear rates.  Additionally, following the 
majority of studies in the coverage expansion literature (3, 28-31), we did not adjust for multiple 
comparisons, which may increase the risk of false positives. 
The MEPS does not include state identifiers in publicly available files.  This prevented us 
from examining the effects of state-specific programs such as the use of insurance navigators and 
the impact of state- vs. federally-administered Marketplaces, although this may have been 
challenging given sample-size limitations. In at least one study, state-administered Marketplaces 
were shown to be more effective in expanding coverage.(6) Lack of state identifiers also 
eliminated the possibility of controlling for the effect of Medicaid expansion in some states, 
which affects the income-range in each state eligible for Marketplace coverage. 
  
 
In addition, not all uninsured adults may have been eligible for Marketplace subsidies, 
either due to immigration status or having an affordable offer of ESI that they did not accept.  
Our dataset did not allow us to evaluate these factors; if anything, this would lead our analysis to 
underestimate the changes in coverage and access among the truly eligible population. 
 
Finally, as stated earlier, no perfect control group exists for the ACA’s Marketplace, 
given that this policy was implemented on a national level at a single point in time.  Many 
observed differences exist between our intervention and control groups, as well as potentially 
unobservable differences.  However, the validity of our difference-in-difference study design 
does not depend on the balance of characteristics between the study groups, but rather on the 
assumption that trends would have been comparable for both study groups in the absence of the 
policy change.  The placebo tests of the pre-ACA period provide support for this assumption.  
The use of our control group strengthens the analysis by reducing bias from mean reversion and 
secular trends in our estimates of Marketplace effects on the previously-uninsured. 
 
RESULTS 
Our study population included 9,653 adults. 5,770 had continuous coverage with ESI and 
3,883 were uninsured for six months or more in Year 1 (Exhibit 1).  Compared to the stable ESI 
group (control group), the uninsured group (treatment group) was younger and more likely to be 
male, Hispanic, and live in the South or West.  Mean family income was lower in the treatment 
group, which was also somewhat less likely to be employed prior to the ACA – though the 
majority of adults in both groups were employed (82.7% vs. 86.9%). 
Exhibit 2 presents changes in health insurance before and after the ACA for each study 
group.  Among the treatment group compared to the control group, ACA implementation was 
  
 
associated with a large drop in the uninsured rate by the end of Year 2 (-10.8 percentage points, 
p<0.001).  The likelihood of having any private insurance increased by 8.8 percentage points 
(p<0.001).   More specifically, rates of non-group private coverage (including Marketplace 
plans) increased by 6.0 percentage points (p<0.001), while Medicaid participation increased to a 
lesser degree (2.5%, p=0.06) and ESI enrollment did not increase significantly.  In 2014, 
Marketplace coverage rates were 6.8% in the treatment group and 1.1% in the control group.    
Exhibit 3 shows monthly rates of non-group private coverage for the treatment and 
control groups – which demonstrates a sharp rise for the treatment group in the first three months 
of 2014, while the control group remained relatively constant.  
Regression-based difference-in-difference estimates are presented in Exhibit 4, and 
Appendix C presents plots of several outcomes over time for the treatment vs. control group.  
The share of previously-uninsured adults reporting that they were unable to get necessary care 
declined by 1.9 percentage points compared to the control group (p=0.08).  There were no 
significant changes in the probability of delaying prescription medications or having a usual 
source of care.  Among those with any expenditures, total medical spending increased by 14.3% 
and out-of-pocket spending increased by 9.7%, but neither estimate reached statistical 
significance. 
The average number of outpatient visits increased by 0.87 (p=0.08) among the 
previously-uninsured, compared to the control group.  The probability of inpatient admission 
increased by 2.5 percentage points (p=0.04).  The number of prescriptions filled increased by 
1.82 medications on average (p=0.05).   The likelihood of emergency department visits did not 
change significantly, and neither did preventive visits or self-reported health.  The likelihood of 
  
 
receiving a diagnosis of hypertension increased by 7 percentage points among the previously 
uninsured (p=0.003).  
Results of a sensitivity analysis using a broader family definition to measure income 
yielded similar results to our primary analysis (Appendix D).  In comparison, the number of 
previously-uninsured adults reporting that they were unable to get necessary care showed a 
larger decline (-2.4 percentage points, p=0.03) and the number of outpatient visits increased 
more robustly (1.31 additional visits, p=0.03). 
 
Subgroup analysis:   
Both the low-income group (138-250% FPL) and the middle-income group (250-400% 
FPL) experienced large increases in coverage by the end of Year 2 (11.1% and 13.2% 
respectively, both p<0.01; Exhibit 4).   
Changes in access and utilization were generally larger among the lower-income 
subgroup than the higher-income subgroup (Exhibit 4), though with some variation across 
outcomes.  For the lower-income group, rates of being unable to access care declined 
significantly (-2.7 percentage points, p=0.05) and outpatient utilization increased (1.96 visits, 
p=0.004), compared to the control group.   Likelihood of any inpatient admission rose by 3.8 
percentage points (p=0.07).  The low-income subgroup also showed a large increase in the 
number of prescription fills (an additional 4.62 per year, p=0.001) and in the likelihood of 
hypertension diagnosis (+6.1 percentage points, p=0.06).  Diagnosis of high cholesterol showed 
an increase in the low-income subgroup (5.7 percentage points, p=0.06), which was not evident 
in the full sample.    
  
 
In the higher-income subgroup, previously uninsured adults experienced a decreased 
likelihood of delaying medications (-3.3 percentage points, p=0.03) and increased likelihood of 
hypertension diagnosis (7.7 percentage points, p=0.08).  Total medical spending among those 
with any expenditures also rose in this subgroup (38.3%, p=0.05).   
 
Placebo tests:   
Our placebo analysis showed no significant differential changes in the pre-ACA cohort 
for nearly all study outcomes (Appendix B).  Only one outcome — cholesterol screening — 
showed a difference at p<0.10; however, this indicated that the likelihood of screening was 
decreasing in the pre-ACA period for our treatment group, which would bias us against finding a 
positive result in this group.  Overall, these findings demonstrate comparable pre-ACA trends in 
outcomes for our treatment and control groups, supporting our difference-in-difference approach.  
 
DISCUSSION  
Using a rich longitudinal national survey, our study offers new evidence on the effect of 
the ACA’s health insurance Marketplaces on subsidy-eligible adults.  Insurance coverage 
increased significantly among previously-uninsured adults, with the majority of growth due to 
Marketplace coverage.   These coverage gains were accompanied by a reduction in barriers to 
needed care, more outpatient visits, increased inpatient care, and additional use of prescription 
drugs.  We also find an increase in the rates of diagnosis of hypertension.  Other outcomes, 
including out-of-pocket and total spending, did not change.  Our findings, detected in the first 
year after the ACA’s implementation, suggest that the Marketplaces are contributing to a broad 
range of positive effects for previously-uninsured adults.  Our analysis of income subgroups 
  
 
suggests that improvements in access to care were concentrated among lower-income adults 
eligible for cost-sharing subsidies.   
These results demonstrate that, despite initial challenges in the rollout of the Marketplace, 
the program was successful in improving coverage among many long-term uninsured adults.  
However, even after the expansion, more than half of this group remained uninsured at the end of 
2014, indicating significant outreach efforts are still needed. Of course, our use of a dataset 
ending in 2014 means that longer-term gains in coverage are not captured in our results.  Of note, 
only 1% of the control group was found to have purchased insurance through the Marketplace in 
2014, indicating that crowd-out of employer-sponsored insurance by the new Marketplace 
subsidies was rare, consistent with prior studies of the ACA.(6, 19)  
 
Our findings of coverage changes are supported by several observational studies that 
have documented similarly-sized changes in the uninsured rate using the National Health 
Interview Survey,(9) Health Reform Monitoring Survey,(32) American Community Survey,(6) 
and Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index.(33)  
We also identified several significant changes in access to care and utilization after 
coverage expansion, consistent with studies of Medicaid expansion under the ACA.  This 
suggests that despite concerns over potentially high cost-sharing and narrow networks in the 
ACA,(34),(15) subsidized Marketplace coverage has still improved care for many middle-income 
adults. Of note, increases in ESI and Medicaid coverage accounted for just under half of the 
coverage gains in our previously-uninsured group, indicating that our findings are not solely 
attributable to new Marketplace coverage.  Still, our results are consistent with several 
observational studies of those in the subsidized Marketplace income range or those who report 
enrolling in Marketplace plans.(13, 30, 35)   
  
 
To our knowledge, no previous work has used quasi-experimental methods to examine 
changes in health care outcomes among a population of previously uninsured Marketplace-
subsidy-eligible adults. Examining longer-term trends in coverage and other health outcomes 
among these individuals is an area for future research.   
Despite finding some beneficial changes in access to care and chronic disease diagnosis, 
many of our study outcomes – including total spending, preventive health measures, and self-
reported health – did not change significantly, in contrast to prior studies of the Medicaid 
expansion.(1-3)  This may reflect the relatively small sample size and that the study only 
included the first year after ACA implementation; many of those who obtained new insurance in 
2014 began coverage midway through the year, leaving limited time to take advantage of new 
opportunities to seek care.  However, it is also possible that Marketplace coverage may be less 
effective at improving some of these measures than Medicaid, and at least some descriptive 
evidence suggests that concerns exist about these plans’ cost-sharing requirements.  For instance, 
a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 36% of Marketplace enrollees were somewhat or 
very dissatisfied with the burden of their insurance deductible compared with 25% of those with 
ESI coverage.(36)  While our study shows this coverage has been beneficial, our post-ACA 
estimates show that many adults still experience barriers to care, and cost-related challenges may 
be more common in Marketplace plans with high cost-sharing than in Medicaid, which 
traditionally has only minimal out-of-pocket payments.(37) 
Our subgroup analysis revealed that improvements in access to care was generally larger 
in the lower-income (138-250% of poverty) subgroup. This has important implications for the 
ACA’s cost-sharing reductions, which are available to Marketplace enrollees with incomes 
below 250% of FPL. Insurers are required to reduce out-of-pocket costs for this group and 
  
 
receive payments from the federal government for these expenses; however, the Trump 
Administration has announced a decision to stop making these payments.(38)  Our findings 
suggest that these cost-sharing subsidies may be an important driver of the positive impacts of 
Marketplace coverage.  However, cost-sharing subsidies are only one potential explanation for 
the larger effect found in the low-income subgroup.  Another is simply that this group had more 
unmet medical needs prior to the ACA.   
 
Conclusions 
Our study provides some of the first quasi-experimental evidence on the effects of the 
ACA’s Marketplace plans on middle and lower-income nonelderly adults who previously lacked 
insurance.  We identified several notable improvements among previously-uninsured adults in 
terms of health care access and utilization.  These benefits were larger for lower-income adults 
eligible to receive cost-sharing reductions.  The Trump Administration’s decision to cease 
payments for cost-sharing subsidies to insurers, as well as plans to eliminate the individual 
mandate, could further erode Marketplace coverage and could undo some of these 
gains.  However, despite notable improvements, we also find that many barriers to care remain in 
this population.  Legislative changes to Marketplace plans that increase generosity of subsidies 
and boost enrollment might produce greater progress on a range of health-care related outcomes.

Source: Authors analysis of MEPS longitudinal data, 2011-2014. 
Notes: Insurance type is the self-reported insurance coverage in December of Year 2 of the longitudinal dataset.  The stable ESI group 
was covered by employer-sponsored insurance for 12 months in year one of the dataset.  The previously-uninsured group was 
uninsured for > or = 6 months in year one of the dataset.  The Pre-ACA cohort includes the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 panels.  The 
ACA-affected cohort includes the 2013-2014 panel.  Difference-in-difference results represent estimates of the difference between the 
previously-uninsured and the previously-insured groups in the ACA-affected cohort (2013-2014) compared to the difference between 
the previously-uninsured and the previously-insured groups in the pre-ACA cohort (2011-2012 and 2012-2013). 
N/A = not applicable, because Marketplace coverage was not assessed in the MEPS (and did not exist) prior to 2014.

Notes: All models use survey weighting and account for complex survey design.  The stable ESI group was covered by employer-
sponsored insurance for 12 months in year one of the dataset.  The previously-uninsured group was uninsured for > or = 6 months in 
year one of the dataset.  The Pre-ACA cohort includes the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 panels.  The ACA-affected cohort includes the 
2013-2014 panel.  Adjusted analyses control for age, sex, race, region, marital status, family size, birthplace outside the U.S., family 
income, and employment status.  Age was transformed to a categorical variable, with five groupings: 18-24; 25-34; 35-44; 45-54; and 
<55.  Race was coded as Black, Hispanic, Asian, or White/other.  Family size was converted to an ordinal categorical variable. OOP =

Notes: Each panel is comprised of a cohort of non-elderly adults that were followed over the course of two years.  In our study, 
inclusion criteria (age/income) and exposure variables (previously-insured via stable ESI or previously-uninsured) were drawn from 
Year 1 of each two-year panel, while outcome measures were assessed in Year 2.

Notes: Placebo tests are designed to detect changes in the pre-ACA period and therefore model the difference-in-differences as if the 
ACA had been implemented in 2013.  The pre-cohort is the 2011-2012 panel and the post-cohort is the 2012-2013 panel. These 
analyses control for age, sex, race, region, marital status, family size, family income, birthplace outside the US a and employment 
status.  All models use survey weighting and account for complex survey design.  The stable ESI group was covered by employer-

dollar to the measures of total and out-of-pocket spending (prior to log-transformation) so that those with zero spending would remain 
part the analysis.
