Worldwide trends in insufficient physical activity from 
2001 to 2016: a pooled analysis of 358 population-based 
surveys with 1·9 million participants
Regina Guthold, Gretchen A Stevens, Leanne M Riley, Fiona C Bull
Summary
Background Insufficient physical activity is a leading risk factor for non-communicable diseases, and has a negative 
effect on mental health and quality of life. We describe levels of insufficient physical activity across countries, and 
estimate global and regional trends.
Methods We pooled data from population-based surveys reporting the prevalence of insufficient physical activity, 
which included physical activity at work, at home, for transport, and during leisure time (ie, not doing at least 150 min 
of moderate-intensity, or 75 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, or any equivalent combination of the 
two). We used regression models to adjust survey data to a standard definition and age groups. We estimated time 
trends using multilevel mixed-effects modelling.
Findings We included data from 358 surveys across 168 countries, including 1·9 million participants. Global age-
standardised prevalence of insufficient physical activity was 27·5% (95% uncertainty interval 25·0–32·2) in 2016, 
with a difference between sexes of more than 8 percentage points (23·4%, 21·1–30·7, in men vs 31·7%, 28·6–39·0, 
in women). Between 2001, and 2016, levels of insufficient activity were stable (28·5%, 23·9–33·9, in 2001; change not 
significant). The highest levels in 2016, were in women in Latin America and the Caribbean (43·7%, 42·9–46·5), 
south Asia (43·0%, 29·6–74·9), and high-income Western countries (42·3%, 39·1–45·4), whereas the lowest levels 
were in men from Oceania (12·3%, 11·2–17·7), east and southeast Asia (17·6%, 15·7–23·9), and sub-Saharan Africa 
(17·9%, 15·1–20·5). Prevalence in 2016 was more than twice as high in high-income countries (36·8%, 35·0–38·0) as 
in low-income countries (16·2%, 14·2–17·9), and insufficient activity has increased in high-income countries over 
time (31·6%, 27·1–37·2, in 2001).
Interpretation If current trends continue, the 2025 global physical activity target (a 10% relative reduction in 
insufficient physical activity) will not be met. Policies to increase population levels of physical activity need to be 
prioritised and scaled up urgently.

Introduction
The health benefits of physical activity are well 
established and include a lower risk of cardiovascular 
disease, hypertension, diabetes, and breast and colon 
cancer. Additionally, physical activity has positive effects 
on mental health, delays the onset of dementia, and can 
help the maintenance of a healthy weight.1–5
In recognition of this strong link between physical 
activity and major non-communicable diseases, member 
states of WHO agreed to a 10% relative reduction in the 
prevalence of insufficient physical activity by 2025, as one 
of the nine global targets to improve the prevention and 
treatment of non-communicable diseases.6 Monitoring 
current levels and trends of insufficient physical activity 
is essential to track progress towards this global physical 
activity target, but also to identify high-risk populations, 
to assess the effectiveness of policy, and guide future 
policy and programme planning.
The first compilation of country data to produce global 
and regional estimates of insufficient physical activity 
was undertaken in the early 2000s, as part of the Global 
Burden of Disease study.7 Bull and colleagues7 included 
data for physical activity from 34 mainly high-income 
countries, mostly focusing on leisure time physical 
activity. Activity performed in other domains (activity at 
work, in the household, and for transport) had to 
be estimated for most countries, in order to get 
comprehensive and comparable results. Subsequently, 
two questionnaires including all activity domains were 
developed: the International Physical Activity Question-
naire8 and the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire.9,10 
Both questionnaires have since been used in many

surveys, including several large, inter 
national surveys 
such as the World Health Survey,11 the Eurobarometer 
surveys,12 and the WHO Stepwise Approach to NCD Risk 
Factor Surveillance.13,14 Mainly based on data from these 
questionnaires, WHO produced comparable estimates of 
insufficient physical activity in 122 countries in 2008, and 
updated them for 2010 for 146 countries. Both sets of 
estimates were published in The Lancet Physical Activity 
Series4,15 and used to calculate the effect of insufficient 
physical activity on non-communicable diseases.16
However, in The Lancet Physical Activity 2016 Series, 
Sallis and colleagues4 noted that consistent data for 
trends in adult physical activity are still scarce. As a 
consequence, no article has reported regional and global 
trends of insufficient physical activity. We updated 
previously published4,15,17 country, regional, and global 
estimates of adult prevalence of insufficient physical 
activity with new data and new methods, and estimated, 
for the first time, global and regional trends from 2001 to 
2016.
Methods
Study design
We estimated the prevalence of insufficient physical 
activity in adults aged 18 years and older, in 168 countries, 
for three World Bank income groups,18 nine regions 
(appendix p 1),19,20 and globally for 2001–16. Insufficient 
physical activity was defined as adults not meeting 
the WHO recommendations3 on physical activity for 
health—ie, at least 150 min of moderate-intensity, or 
75 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, 
or any equivalent combination of the two. 
Data sources
We included data that fulfilled the following criteria: (1) the 
survey questionnaire explicitly included physical activity 
across four key domains—ie, for work, in the house-
hold (paid or unpaid), for transport to get to and from 
places (ie, walking and cycling), and during leisure time 
(ie, sports and active recreation); (2) data were collected 
through random sampling with a sample size of at 
least 200, and were representative of a national or defined 
subnational population; (3) prevalence of insufficient 
physical activity was reported by age and sex, according 
to current WHO,3 or former physical activity recom-
mendations.21 These former guidelines recom 
mended for 
adults to spread out their activity during the week in doing 
at least 30 min of moderate activity on at least 5 days, or 
equivalent. They were in place until an update of evidence 
in 2008,1 when this requirement was removed.
Physical activity data collected using wearable devices, 
such as accelerometers or pedometers, were not included 
because of the limited comparability with self-reported 
data. Where available, we used individual-level data to 
calculate the prevalence of insufficient physical activity, 
taking the sampling designs into account. Where raw 
data were not available, we used aggregated data as 
reported. We included all data that met the inclusion 
criteria and that were provided before the end of 
September, 2017
.
We obtained data from WHO and other international 
surveys.11–14 We also did a systematic literature search of 
PubMed, up to October, 2015, for articles published in 
English, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Chinese, and 
Italian, including the International Physical Activity 
Question 
naire 
and 
the 
Global 
Physical 
Activity 
Questionnaire as search terms. To identify additional 
data sources, we also analysed and verified results of the 
2017 WHO NCD Country Capacity Survey,22 in which 
each WHO member state answered a question on the 
inclusion of physical activity in national risk factor 
surveys. We also had personal communications with 
WHO regional focal points, personal networks, and 
directly with researchers, including inquiries about 
additional data from authors of published studies. 
Finally, we had a 6-week consultation with all WHO 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
WHO produced the first set of internationally comparable 
estimates on insufficient physical activity in 2008 for 
122 countries. These estimates were updated for 2010, and 
published in the 2016 Lancet Series on Physical activity for 
146 countries, showing a global prevalence of insufficient 
physical activity of 23·3%, with higher levels among women and 
older age groups. However, no compilation of global data on 
adult physical inactivity has been undertaken since, and no 
regional and global trends have previously been developed 
because data for trends have been considered too scarce.
Added value of this study
This study provides the most complete description of global, 
regional, and country levels of insufficient physical activity and, 
for the first time, presents regional and global trends over time. 
Global age-standardised prevalence of insufficient physical 
activity was 27·5% (95% uncertainty interval 25·0–32·2) in 
2016. The prevalence has been stable since 2001.
Implications of all the available evidence
Progress towards achieving the global target of a 10% relative 
reduction of insufficient physical activity by 2025, has been too 
slow. Accelerated action is needed to reverse trends in central 
and eastern Europe, high-income Western countries, Latin 
American and the Caribbean, and south Asia. Policies and 
programmes are also needed to achieve or maintain low levels 
of inactivity in other regions and in lower-income countries. 
Implementation of targeted evidence-based interventions 
presented in the Global Physical Activity Action Plan 2018–2030 
will improve population health and help deliver many of the 
2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

member states in which countries commented on the 
first draft of estimates and submitted any additional 
data. After the consultation, the estimates were updated 
during October, 2017, with new data that were submitted. 
In total, 358 surveys from 168 countries were included in 
the analysis (appendix pp 2–15).
Statistical analysis
Survey data were sometimes not comparable because 
of differences in study design. We applied four key 
adjustments to survey data using linear regression 
modelling to improve comparability (appendix pp 17–27). 
First, we converted definitions. For surveys in which data 
were reported only for the former recommendation 
on physical activity for health,21 and not for the current 
recommendation,3 we converted data to the current 
recommendation, our target indicator.
Second, we adjusted for over-reporting in the 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire. This 
question 
naire over-reports physical activity, leading to an 
under 
estimation of the prevalence of insufficient 
activity.23–26 To correct for this over-reporting, we applied 
an adjustment factor to surveys that used the Inter-
national Physical Activity Questionnaire. This adjustment 
factor was determined by exploring differences in 
prevalence between the International Physical Activity 
Questionnaire and other, similar survey questionnaires, 
such as the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, in 
countries that have used both. 
Third, we adjusted data from surveys that had only 
urban samples. Of the 358 surveys used, 27 reported data 
for urban populations only. For these surveys, we 
estimated the prevalence in rural areas using information 
from surveys reporting both urban and rural prevalence.

We calculated a national estimate combining the two by 
applying estimates of population by area of residence for 
the respective survey year.27
Fourth, for surveys that did not report data for all ages 
older than 18 years, we estimated the data for the missing 
age groups using information from surveys that reported 
age-specific values for the entire age range.
The methods used to generate final estimates of 
insufficient physical activity prevalence by country, year, 
sex, and age differed depending on the availability of data 
on trends over time.
Of the 168 countries included, 65 had done at least 
two comparable surveys from different years using the 
same questionnaire (appendix p 16). For these countries, 
we estimated the prevalence of insufficient physical 
activity for each year from 2001, to 2016, using a multi-
level mixed-effects linear regression model. To allow 
estimates to be informed by data from the same country, 
from other countries in the region, and other variables, 
this model included a random slope on year, a random 
intercept for each country, and fixed effects for country 
urbanisation, education, and location within nine 
previously defined regions that have been used in similar 
analysis for other non-communicable disease risk 
factors.19,20 For 76 countries, only one survey was available. 
We assumed no change over time in these countries, 
based on the fact that the average change in prevalence 
per year across the 65 countries with at least two 
comparable surveys was less than 0·01%.
27 countries had done several surveys with different 
survey coverage, or with different questionnaires, 
limiting comparability of these survey data. Although we 
adjusted for over-reporting in the International Physical 
Activity Questionnaire, we considered the comparison of

adjusted data from the International Physical Activity 
Questionnaire to data from other questionnaires to be 
insufficient to inform country trends. Therefore, for 
these 27 countries, we also assumed a flat trend, whereby 
the trend line was based on the average prevalences 
across surveys for each country.
To derive final estimates for the entire age range, we 
age-standardised resulting sex-specific and age-specific 
prevalence estimates using the WHO Standard Popu-
lation.28 To produce global and regional estimates, 
and estimates for World Bank income groups,18 we 
created population-weighted sex-specific and age-
specific estimates for each subgroup and year,29 and 
then age-standardised these estimates.28 Using the 
bootstrap method, we drew 1000 samples, each 
containing 80% of all survey data, to produce uncertainty 
intervals [UI] for these estimates, representing the 
2·5th and 97·5th percentile of the 1000 draws. We 
calculated trends as the difference in prevalence 
between 2001, and 2016, and considered a change in 
prevalence over time to be statistically significant if 
fewer than 2·5% of draws showed changing trend 
(appendix pp 17–27).30

the world’s population. The availability of data across 
income groups and regions was spread fairly evenly, with 
the exception of Latin American and Caribbean countries 
where just more than half of countries had data (table 1). 
Of the 358 surveys included, 301 were nationally 
representative, and 150 of 168 countries had at least one 
national survey (appendix pp 2–15).
65 of 168 countries had at least two surveys using 
the same questionnaire and survey coverage (table 1, 
appendix p 16). Availability of data meeting these 
two criteria was skewed towards higher-income countries, 
with only 3·2% of low-income countries and 48·0% of 
high-income countries having trend data (table 1).
Globally, more than a quarter of adults (27·5%, 95% UI 
25·0–32·2) were insufficiently physically active in 2016 
(table 2). Between 2001 and 2016, levels of insufficient 
physical activity have decreased only marginally and 
insignificantly, with a global prevalence of 28·5% 
(23·9–33·9) in 2001. Women were less active than men, 
with a prevalence difference of 6 percentage points 
between sexes in 2001 (25·5%, 95% UI 23·1–33·0 for 
men, and 31·5%, 95% UI 27·9–37·8 for women), and 
of more than 8 percentage points in 2016 (23·4%, 
21·1–30·7, for men, and 31·7%, 28·6–39·0, for women; 
figures 1 and 2).
Prevalence of insufficient physical activity ranged 
from 16·3% (95% UI 14·3–20·7) in Oceania to 39·1% 
(37·8–40·6) in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2016 
(table 2). Between 2001 and 2016, the prevalence of physical 
inactivity increased by more than 5 percentage points in 
high-income Western countries (from 30·9%, 26·4–38·1 in 
2001, to 36·8%, 34·6–38·4, in 2016) and in Latin America 
and Caribbean (from 33·4%, 29·1–38·6, in 2001, to 39·1%, 
37·8–40·6, in 2016), whereas east and southeast Asia had a 
decrease of more than 5 percentage points (from 25·7%, 
20·6–29·4, in 2001, to 17·3%, 15·8–22·1, in 2016).
Across all regions, with the exception of east and 
southeast Asia, women were less active than men in 2016 
(table 2). There was a difference between sexes of more 
than 10 percentage points in central Asia, Middle East 
and north Africa; high-income Western countries; and 
south Asia (table 2). The highest levels of insufficient 
activity (>40%) among women in 2016 were in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, south Asia, and high-income 
Western countries (table 2). The lowest levels of physical 
activity in men (<20%) in 2016 were in Oceania, east and 
southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa (table 2).
The prevalence of insufficient physical activity in high-
income countries was more than double the prevalence 
in low-income countries in 2016 (table 2). The prevalence 
increased over time in high-income countries, from 
31·6% (27·1–37·2) in 2001, to 36·8% (35·0–38·0) in 
2016, whereas it was stable in low-income countries, at 
16·0% (12·0–19·6) in 2001, and 16·2% (14·2–17·9) in 
2016 (table 2, figure 3).
Country-specific, age-standardised prevalence of in-
sufficient physical activity in 2016 ranged from 5·5% 
(4·0–7·6) in Uganda to 67·0% (58·6–74·3) in Kuwait 
(appendix pp 28–31). In four countries, the prevalence of 
insufficient physical activity was more than 50% (Kuwait, 
American Samoa, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq), whereas 
the prevalence was lower than 10% in seven countries 
(Uganda, Mozambique, Lesotho, Tanzania, Niue, Vanuatu, 
and Togo). In 55 (32·7%) of 168 countries, more than a 
third of the population was insufficiently physically active.
In 159 of 168 countries, prevalence of insufficient 
physical activity was lower in men than in women, with a 
difference of at least 10 percentage points in 65 countries, 
and a difference of more than 20 percentage points in 
nine countries: Barbados, Bahamas, Saint Lucia, Palau, 
Iraq, Bangladesh, Trinidad and Tobago, Iran, and Saudi 
Arabia. Figures 4 and 5 show country prevalence for men 
and women.
Of the 65 countries with data for trends over time, 
28 had decreasing levels of insufficient activity, whereas 
levels were increasing in 37 countries. The largest 
decreases (>15%) have occurred in Cook Islands, Jordan, 
Tokelau, Samoa, Myanmar, Solomon Islands, and 
Tonga, while the largest increases (>15%) occurred in 
Brazil, Bulgaria, Germany, Philippines, and Singapore. 
The average change across all of 65 countries was less 
than 0·01%.

Discussion
Our analysis, including data from nearly 2 million 
participants (representing 96% of the global population), 
shows that globally, in 2016, more than a quarter of all 
adults was not getting enough physical activity. This puts 
more than 1·4 billion adults at risk of developing or 
exacerbating diseases linked to inactivity, and needs to be 
urgently addressed. Previous estimates4 showed a global 
prevalence of insufficient physical activity of 23·3% in 2010. 
This difference from our results is due to our inclusion of 
nearly twice as many surveys (358 vs 195), and our ability to 
produce estimates for an additional 22 countries. Our 
estimates will be made available in the WHO Global Health 
Observatory,17 where they can be downloaded for use in 
projects such as burden of disease calculations.16
Prevalence of insufficient physical activity varied 
greatly across regions and income groups in 2016. We 
found the highest levels in Latin America and the Carib-
bean, high-income Western countries, and high-income 
Asia Pacific, and prevalence was more than double in 
high-income countries than in low-income countries in 
2016. In wealthier countries, the transition towards 
more sedentary occupations and personal motorised 
transportation probably explains the higher levels of 
inactivity. Conversely, in lower-income countries, more 
activity is undertaken at work and for transport; however, 
these behaviours are changing rapidly.31 National policy 
needs to be implemented to encourage non-motorised 
modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, 
and to promote participation in active recreation and 
sports in leisure time. Such policies are particularly 
important in countries with rapid urbanisation, such as 
Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia,27 which contribute to 
the high levels of insufficient activity in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. Effective policies include improved 
provision of cycling and walking infrastructure, im-
proving road safety, and creating more opportunities for 
physical activity in public open spaces and parks, in 
workplaces, and in other local community settings.5,32,33

We also found a wide variation in country prevalence 
of insufficient activity both across and within regions. 
The prevalence of insufficient activity was lower than 10% 
in a few countries, and more than 50% in others. This 
inequality has also been confirmed by Althoff and 
colleagues,34 who used movement sensors built into smart-
phones to assess physical activity. Despite the difference 
in measurement method (we used self-reported physical 
activity), and differences in sampling, the resulting 
patterns of activity are similar, with some of the least active 
countries located in central and south America and north 
Africa and the Middle East, and some of the most active 
countries in east Asia and eastern Europe. The fact that 
activity varies greatly across countries, even within regions, 
suggests that the factors that influence inactivity lie mostly 
at the national, sub 
national, or community level, which is 
where policies are needed to increase physical activity.32
Our study confirms findings34–37 of lower activity in 
women than in men, with some of the biggest differences 
in south and central Asia and the Middle East and north 
Africa. One way to explain sex differences in activity is 
to assess male and female participation in different 
domains of activity (activity at work or in the house-
hold, for transport, and during leisure time), and at 
different intensities (moderate and vigorous). Previous 
research36,38,39 indicates that women tend to do less 
leisure-time activity, and lower-intensity activity than do 
men. Offering more opportunities for safe and accessible 
leisure-time activity to women in order to increase their 
overall levels of activity would therefore help close the 
gender gap and achieve the 2025 global physical activity 
target.38 Furthermore, cultural norms, traditional roles, 
or lack of social and community support might lead to 
reduced participation in physical activity among girls 
and women. Understanding and addressing these 
barriers is needed to plan and deliver culturally sensitive 
actions to support behaviour change.40
Our analysis was the first to assess trends in physical 
inactivity over time. The global prevalence of physical 
inactivity was stable between 2001 and 2016, suggesting 
no progress in reducing global levels to reach the 2025 
global physical activity target.6 However, we found a wide 
variation in trends in inactivity across regions, income 
groups, and countries. The largest increases in insufficient 
physical activity have occurred in high-income countries, 
whereas the largest decreases have occurred in east and 
southeast Asia. These decreases are largely explained by 
increased participation in physical activity in China, the 
most populous  country in the region (data not shown). 
Leisure-time physical activity in China has increased,41 
which might be explained by increased park use and 
physical activity among China’s rapidly growing elderly 
population.42 The lack of progress in other regions might 
be explained by the fact that, although more than 70% of 
countries have an operational physical activity policy, the 
scale and reach of its implementation is yet to have a 
national impact.4,32
Our study is affected by several limitations. First, similar 
to all global analyses, data were not available for every 
country and year, and availability varied across countries 
and regions. Latin America and the Caribbean, 
high-income Western countries, Oceania, and sub-
Saharan Africa had the lowest proportion of countries 
with data. However, within these regions, the most 
populous countries were more likely to have data, so that 
the proportion of the population with data in these regions 
was still high. Countries with a population of more than 
10 million with no data were Bolivia, Haiti, and Peru in 
Latin America and the Caribbean; Angola, Burundi, 
Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan in sub-Saharan Africa; 
Afghanistan in south Asia; Syria and Yemen in central 
Asia, Middle East, and North Africa; and North Korea in 
east and southeast Asia. Some of these countries are also 
classified as low-income countries, which had the lowest 
data availability of the income groups. The availability of 
data for trends in physical inactivity was clearly skewed 
towards high-income countries, with 48·0% of countries 
being covered, compared with 3·2% of low-income 
countries. In fact, our trend estimations for low-income 
countries were based on one country only, Benin, 
which limits the representativeness for other low-income 
countries. Data coverage for trends was low in sub-
Saharan Africa, Latin American and the Caribbean, and 
south Asia, indicating that trend estimates for these 
regions should be interpreted with caution.
Second, data quality also varied across countries and 
over time. 131 (37%) of the 358 surveys included data that 
were collected through the WHO Stepwise Approach to 
NCD Risk Factor Surveillance, using the Global Physical 
Activity Questionnaire.9,10,14 The WHO Stepwise Approach 
was started in 2001, and the earlier surveys tended to be 
less representative with sometimes only subnational 
coverage.14 Nonetheless, we included these data in our 
analysis because they help to provide global coverage for 
the earlier years.
Third, we had to rely on self-reported data in our analysis 
despite their limitations.43 Nationally repre 
sentative data 
for physical activity that are collected objectively, using 
accelerometers, for example, are mostly only available for 
high-income countries, and results are not comparable 
across countries because of variations in data collection 
methods, data processing, and scoring.4,44 In the next few 
years we expect that more objective physical activity data 
will become available at a larger scale, and for the next 
update of our comparable estimates we will reconsider 
inclusion of these data in some way.
Finally, in some cases, our estimates are different to 
prevalence estimates produced by countries. There are 
several reasons for this difference. We adjusted our 
estimates for several factors when necessary. We also 
standardised our estimates to an artificial age structure, 
the WHO Standard Population.28 Furthermore, some 
countries tend to produce estimates for only leisure time 
physical activity, whereas we include four domains of

physical activity. In these cases, national estimates 
of physical inactivity prevalence will be higher than our 
comparable estimates.
Our data show that progress towards the global target 
set by WHO member states to reduce physical inactivity 
by 10% by 2025 has been too slow and is not on track. 
Levels of insufficient physical activity are particularly high 
and still rising in high-income countries, and worldwide, 
women are less active than are men. A significant 
increase in national action is urgently needed in most 
countries to scale-up implementation of effective policies. 
The Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018–2030,32 
is a new catalyst for global action, and provides a selection 
of 20 specific policies targeting different settings and 
populations that can be adapted and tailored to local 
contexts in all countries. However, implementation will 
require bold leadership and full engagement across 
sectors to change the current approach. Collaboration 
across sectors could generate significant returns, because 
policies that support increasing physical activity can 
provide other benefits to health, local economies, 
community wellbeing, and environ 
mental sustainability, 
and contri 
bute towards achieving many of the 2030 
Sustainable Development Goals.5
