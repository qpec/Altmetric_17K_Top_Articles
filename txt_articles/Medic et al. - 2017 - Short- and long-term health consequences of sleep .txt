Abstract: Sleep plays a vital role in brain function and systemic physiology across many body 
systems. Problems with sleep are widely prevalent and include deficits in quantity and qual-
ity of sleep; sleep problems that impact the continuity of sleep are collectively referred to as 
sleep disruptions. Numerous factors contribute to sleep disruption, ranging from lifestyle and 
environmental factors to sleep disorders and other medical conditions. Sleep disruptions have 
substantial adverse short- and long-term health consequences. A literature search was conducted 
to provide a nonsystematic review of these health consequences (this review was designed to be 
nonsystematic to better focus on the topics of interest due to the myriad parameters affected by 
sleep). Sleep disruption is associated with increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system 
and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, metabolic effects, changes in circadian rhythms, and 
proinflammatory responses. In otherwise healthy adults, short-term consequences of sleep dis-
ruption include increased stress responsivity, somatic pain, reduced quality of life, emotional 
distress and mood disorders, and cognitive, memory, and performance deficits. For adolescents, 
psychosocial health, school performance, and risk-taking behaviors are impacted by sleep 
disruption. Behavioral problems and cognitive functioning are associated with sleep disrup-
tion in children. Long-term consequences of sleep disruption in otherwise healthy individuals 
include hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, weight-related issues, metabolic 
syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and colorectal cancer. All-cause mortality is also increased 
in men with sleep disturbances. For those with underlying medical conditions, sleep disruption 
may diminish the health-related quality of life of children and adolescents and may worsen the 
severity of common gastrointestinal disorders. As a result of the potential consequences of sleep 
disruption, health care professionals should be cognizant of how managing underlying medical 
conditions may help to optimize sleep continuity and consider prescribing interventions that 
minimize sleep disruption.

Introduction
Sleep is a biologic process that is essential for life and optimal health. Sleep plays a 
critical role in brain function and systemic physiology, including metabolism, appetite 
regulation, and the functioning of immune, hormonal, and cardiovascular systems.1,2 
Normal healthy sleep is characterized by sufficient duration, good quality, appropriate 
timing and regularity, and the absence of sleep disturbances and disorders.3 Despite the 
importance of sleep, up to 70 million people in the US and ~45 million people in Europe 
have a chronic sleep disorder that impacts daily functioning and health.2,4 For example, 
~20% of the serious injuries that result from car accidents can be associated with driver 
sleepiness, independent of the effects of alcohol.2 Lifestyle and  
environmental factors,

psychosocial issues, and medical conditions all contribute to 
sleep problems.2 There are ~100 sleep disorder classifications; 
however, they are typically manifested in one of the following 
three ways: failure to obtain the necessary amount or quality 
of sleep (sleep deprivation), an inability to maintain sleep 
continuity (disrupted sleep, also called sleep fragmentation, 
difficulty maintaining sleep, and middle insomnia), and 
events that occur during sleep (eg, sleep apnea, restless legs 
syndrome).2 The effects of sleep disorders on the body are 
numerous and widely varied across multiple body systems. 
This review focuses on the clinical consequences, both short 
term and long term, that result from disrupted sleep (not 
including short sleep duration) in adults, adolescents, and 
children who are otherwise healthy and in those who have 
an underlying medical condition. Information on basic sci-
ence and mechanisms of these effects are included to provide 
background for the clinical outcomes, but are not thoroughly 
reviewed. Several recent reviews provide detailed information 
on the science and mechanisms of sleep disruption.5–7
Methodology
In order to better focus on the topics of interest among the 
myriad parameters affected by sleep, this review of the litera-
ture was designed to be nonsystematic. A search of English-
language publications in the PubMed database was conducted 
in March and April 2016. Search terms were “caregiver AND 
sleep”, “caregiver AND drug administration”, “insomnia”, 
“middle insomnia”, “restless leg[s] syndrome”, “sleep AND 
drug administration”, “sleep apnea”, “sleep continuity”, “sleep 
deprivation”, “sleep disorder”, “sleep disruption”, “sleep dis-
turbance”, “sleep fragmentation”, and “sleep maintenance”. 
Together, these search terms generated over 60,000 hits. For 
each individual search, we reviewed the most recent articles 
to identify those that specifically discussed the consequences 
of disrupted sleep, rather than those of short sleep duration 
or other sleep problems. For topics that were not adequately 
covered by recent literature (previous ~5–10 years), we looked 
slightly further back in the literature. Other publications were 
identified by examining the reference lists of publications 
included in the literature searches. The websites of the Ameri-
can Academy of Sleep Medicine, Sleep Research Society, and 
the European Sleep Research Society were also searched for 
additional publications. This nonsystematic review pulled 
information from a total of 97 references.
Characteristics of normal sleep
The stages of sleep have historically been divided into one 
stage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and four stages 
(Stages 1–4) of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep that 
are characterized by increasing sleep depth.2,8 The deeper 
sleep stages (Stages 3 and 4) are collectively referred to as 
slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is believed to be the most 
restorative type of sleep and typically occurs during the first 
one-third of the night.2,8,9 In contrast, REM sleep increases 
as the night progresses and is longest in the last one-third of 
a sleep episode.2 REM and NREM sleep are characterized 
by numerous, yet different, physiologic changes, including 
brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure (BP), sympathetic 
nervous system activity, muscle tone, blood flow to the 
brain, respiration, airway resistance, renal function, endo-
crine function, body temperature, and sexual arousal.2 
For example, during NREM sleep, heart rate, BP, blood 
flow to the brain, and respiration are decreased compared 
with wakeful periods. During REM sleep, these processes 
are increased compared with NREM sleep. Brain activity 
decreases from wakefulness during NREM sleep; activity 
levels are similar during REM sleep, except for increases 
in motor and sensory areas.2
A newer sleep classification system developed by the 
American Academy of Sleep Medicine has only three stages 
of NREM sleep: lighter sleep (Stages N1 and N2) and 
deeper sleep (or SWS; Stage N3).10 The major changes with 
the newer classification system are focused on electroen-
cephalogram (EEG) derivations and the merging of Stages 
3 and 4 into Stage N3.11 In a comparison of the two sleep 
classifications, only minor differences were noted for total 
sleep time, sleep efficiency, and REM sleep, but the choice of 
classification impacted the measurement of wake after sleep 
onset and the distribution of NREM sleep stages.11
The two-process model describes the interplay between 
the sleep-promoting process (process S) and the maintenance 
of wakefulness system (process C).2 The balance between 
these processes shifts throughout the course of the day, 
leading to regulation of the sleep–wake cycle. This sleep–
wake cycle is controlled by daily rhythms of physiology 
and behavior, called circadian rhythms.2 Circadian rhythms 
also control metabolic activity through physical activity and 
food consumption, as well as body temperature, heart rate, 
muscle tone, and hormone secretion.2 The sleep process is 
regulated by neurons in the hypothalamus, which turn off the 
arousal systems in order to allow sleep to occur.2 Insomnia 
results from the loss of these neurons. Other brain regions 
are also involved in sleep disruption, including the brain stem 
and cognitive areas of the forebrain. Over the course of the 
night, neurons in the pons switch between NREM and REM 
sleep by sending outputs to the brain stem and spinal cord,

Consequences of sleep disruption
causing muscle atonia and chaotic autonomic activity; to the 
forebrain; and to the thalamus via cholinergic pathways.2
The circadian rhythms work to synchronize sleep with 
the external day–night cycle, via the suprachiasmatic nucleus 
(SCN) that receives direct input from nerve cells in the retina 
acting as brightness detectors.2,12 Light travels from the 
retina to the SCN, which signals the pineal gland to control 
the secretion of melatonin. This neurohormone acts to syn-
chronize the circadian rhythms with the environment and the 
body through melatonin receptors in nearly all tissues. The 
SCN also works with a series of clock genes to synchronize 
the peripheral tissues, giving rise to daily patterns of activity.
Overview of sleep disruption
Disruption of sleep is widespread. A 2014 survey conducted 
by the National Sleep Foundation reported that 35% of Ameri-
can adults rated their sleep quality as “poor” or “only fair”.13 
Trouble falling asleep at least one night per week was reported 
by 45% of respondents.13 In addition, 53% of respondents had 
trouble staying asleep on at least one night of the previous 
week, and 23% of respondents had trouble staying asleep on 
five or more nights.13 Snoring was reported by 40% of respon-
dents,13 and 17% of respondents had been told by a physician 
that they have a sleep disorder, the majority (68%) of which 
was sleep apnea.13 Relatively few studies have looked at sleep 
disruption in children. In a study that included a random sample 
of Chinese children aged 5–12 years, the overall prevalence of 
chronic sleep disruption was 9.8% (boys, 10.0%; girls, 8.9%).14
Risk factors for sleep disruption are vast and involve a com-
bination of biologic, psychologic, genetic, and social factors 
(Table 1).2,6,15–39 Lifestyle factors include consuming excessive 
amounts of caffeine15 and drinking alcohol.16 Performing shift 
work20 or being a college student2 is also a risk factor for sleep 
disruption. Exposure to excessive nighttime light pollution and 
underexposure to daytime sunlight can lead to disruption of 
circadian rhythms.19 Stressful life circumstances, such as being 
the parent of a young infant21 or serving as a caregiver for a 
family member with a chronic, life-threatening, or terminal 
illness,22–25 are also contributors to sleep problems. In addition 
to the stress and worry associated with caregiving, caregivers 
of patients with complex medication schedules may experience 
sleep disruption due to the requirement to wake themselves 
during the night to administer medication.25
Sleep disruption is frequently attributable to a sleep dis-
order, such as obstructive sleep apnea26,27 and restless legs 
syndrome, which is related to altered dopamine and iron 
metabolism; >50% of idiopathic cases of restless leg syndrome 
have a positive family history.28,29 Many major medical condi-
tions have been associated with sleep disruption, particularly 
those that require nighttime medical monitoring (eg, continu-
ous glucose monitoring for individuals with diabetes)38 or hos-
pitalization, especially in an intensive or critical care unit.39,40
Sleep deprivation studies and studies of insomniacs have 
identified the primary mechanisms by which sleep disruption 
is believed to exert its detrimental short- and long-term health 
effects (Figure 1).41–44 During both brief and extended arousals 
during sleep, increased metabolism is evidenced by increased 
oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production.43 Levels of 
catecholamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine have been cor-
related with fragmented sleep.44 In addition, chronic persistent 
insomnia is associated with increased secretion of adrenocor-
ticotropic hormone and cortisol, which is present throughout 
a 24-hour sleep–wake cycle.42 These findings suggest that 
activations of the sympathetic nervous system, the sympatho-
adrenal system, and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis 
are involved in the health consequences of sleep disruption.41–44 
In addition, suppression of SWS was associated with decreased 
insulin sensitivity that did not result in an increase in insulin 
release; these findings may explain the increased risk of type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in patients with poor sleep qual-
ity.9 Other metabolic changes include decreased leptin and 
increased ghrelin that may contribute to increased appetite.45

Sleep abnormalities affect immune function in a reciprocal 
manner, leading to changes in proinflammatory cytokines, such 
as tumor necrosis factor, interleukins 1 and 6, and C-reactive 
protein.12,46 The multitude of systems that react to sleep loss 
suggest effects beyond the central nervous system and include 
total body functioning.5
These wide-ranging effects of sleep disruption are often 
interrelated and bidirectional. For example, the distress asso-
ciated with sleep loss can create additional stress to maximize 
sleep, which, in turn, contributes to worsening (rather than 
improving) sleep disruption.23 The current research suggests 
that the mechanisms of short- and long-term health conse-
quences are similar but are affected by time. In chronic sleep 
deprivation, the body’s ability to compensate for physiologic 
changes is diminished, leading to gradually accumulating 
effects and basal changes.47 Insomniacs have been shown to 
have increased EEG activity, abnormal hormone secretion, 
increased metabolic activity, and increased sympathetic 
nervous system activity throughout the day and night. Over 
time, this heightened and abnormal activity, resulting from 
the lack of appropriate body rest, can lead to the development 
of disease and chronic conditions.45 Further, insufficient sleep 
may contribute to alterations in the neuroendocrine stress 
response system, ultimately leading to stress-related disorders 
such as mood disorders and depression.47
Short-term health consequences of 
sleep disruption
As a result of the physiologic changes associated with 
sleep disruption, numerous health consequences have been 
reported. Short-term consequences of sleep disruption 
include increased stress responsivity; somatic problems; 
reduced quality of life (QoL); emotional distress; mood dis-
orders and other mental health problems; cognition, memory, 
and performance deficits; and behavior problems in otherwise 
healthy individuals. Sleep disruption may also diminish the 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children and ado-
lescents with underlying medical conditions.
Short-term consequences in otherwise 
healthy individuals
Increased stress responsivity
Increased autonomic sympathetic activation is a consequence 
of fragmented and interrupted sleep.47 Results of experimen-
tal studies suggest that the extent of increased sympathetic 
activation was related more to the disruption and disconti-
nuity of sleep than to the duration of sleep deprivation or 
the amount of sleep that was lost.44,48,49 Sympathoadrenal 
activation produces a combination of transient hemodynamic, 
vasoconstrictive, and prothrombotic processes associated 
with a stress response.48 These effects of sleep disruption on 
nocturnal regulation of sympathetic activity may offer a con-
nection between sleep disruption and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) as well as psychiatric conditions.48 By affecting stress 
hormones, sleep disruption may directly affect functionality, 
including cognition and mood.

Consequences of sleep disruption
27% and that sleep problems were strongly associated with 
weekly headache and abdominal pain.50 Girls had more 
symptoms than boys, and an increasing frequency of pain 
and sleep problems was associated with psychosocial dif-
ficulties, such as psychiatric symptoms and substance use. 
Bidirectional associations between somatic problems and 
sleep disorders are expected, and these associations may be 
related to common background factors, such as personality 
and adverse life events.50 During clinical examination, when 
one symptom is reported, screening for related symptoms 
should be considered.
Psychosocial issues
Adults
Studies have identified a range of psychosocial issues associ-
ated with sleep disruption in adults, from emotional distress 
and mood disorders to cognitive, memory, and performance 
deficits.
In a qualitative interview-based study by Neu et al,23 
mothers of children who were receiving maintenance treat-
ment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia routinely experienced 
sleep disruption because their children awoke and needed 
assistance or because of worries related to the child’s ill-
ness. The mothers reported being irritable, impatient, and 
less productive than before the illness. In a longitudinal, 
community-based study of midlife women who had a his-
tory of depression and/or anxiety but were not currently ill, 
sleep disturbance was significantly associated with reduced 
HRQoL, as measured by the 36-item Short Form Health 
Survey (SF-36). Odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 2.04 to 2.96, 
with P < 0.05 across all HRQoL domains.51 A study of 61 
maternal caregivers of young children with bronchopulmo-
nary dysplasia showed that 80% of mothers had clinically 
disturbed sleep (based on self-report using the Pittsburgh 
Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]).25 This sleep disturbance may 
be due to the need to administer medication and provide 
other care during the night, as well as worry about the child’s 
condition. Disrupted sleep was associated with diminished 
QoL in this study, as assessed using the World Health Orga-
nization’s Quality of Life Brief. Sleep quality emerged as 
the only independent variable to significantly predict QoL.
A recent review by Meerlo et al52 surveyed the evidence 
that showed that disrupted sleep is a major causal factor in 
the development of depression. An experimental study that 
compared the effects of forced nocturnal awakenings with 
restricted sleep opportunity and uninterrupted sleep showed 
that partial sleep loss from sleep continuity disruption was 
more detrimental to positive mood than partial sleep loss 
from delaying bedtime.53 Adult subjects experiencing forced 
awakenings had significantly less SWS after the first night 
of sleep deprivation than other participants. Furthermore, in 
adults who completed the Personality Assessment Inventory, 
self-reports of recurring sleep problems were associated 
with symptoms of depression and anxiety.54 The reported 
frequency of sleep disturbance was closely linked with the 
severity of the self-reported symptoms. Among primary 
care physicians, disrupted sleep was associated with high 
burnout levels.55
Sleep disruption alters cognition and performance in many 
domains, including attention/vigilance, executive function, 
emotional reactivity, memory formation, decision-making, 
risk-taking behavior, and judgment.56 An experimental study 
showed that SWS disruption resulted in slower or impaired 
information processing, impaired sustained attention, less 
precise motor control, and erroneous implementation of 
well-practiced actions.57 Y
ounger, middle-aged, and older 
adults were similarly affected by SWS disruption. In another 
study, poor sleep quality negatively affected the emotional 
valence of memories.58
Across these various studies, the interrelationships 
between sleep disruption, life events (such as illness of 
a child), and increased stress responsivity confound the 
physiologic response. These associations are bidirectional, as 
anxiety and depression are associated with sleep disruption, 
and thus make it challenging to separate cause from conse-
quence.47 Despite this difficulty, sleep disruption impacts 
psychosocial functioning in adults and may contribute to psy-
chological conditions that require appropriate intervention.
Adolescents
Later bedtimes and an inadequate amount of sleep are 
well-documented changes in sleep patterns associated with 
adolescence.59 A systematic review including 76 studies of 
the functional consequences of sleep problems in adolescents 
showed that sleep disruption had a negative effect on psy-
chosocial health, school performance, and risk-taking behav-
iors, particularly use of nicotine and marijuana.59 Studies 
assessing the relationships between sleep and psychosocial 
health measures found that sleep disruption was associated 
with new onset of poor mental health status,60 loneliness,61 
worry,62 anxiety,61,63 and depression.63 In a study of 1,629 
adolescents, those with excellent academic performance 
had earlier bedtimes and longer sleep on weekdays with 
less severe daytime sleepiness than those with poor grades.64 
Other studies showed an association between sleep quality 
and sleep deprivation with poor academic performance.65,66

Medic et al
Adolescent risk behaviors associated with sleep disruption 
included cigarette smoking,67,68 drinking alcohol,68,69 illicit 
drug use,68 and aggressive behaviors, including driving while 
intoxicated, considering suicide, and having unprotected 
sex.59,62,68
Psychosocial outcomes such as depression and mood 
disturbances, risk-taking behavior, and academic perfor-
mance appear to be the primary factors affected by sleep 
disruption in adolescents. Taken together, causal bidirectional 
relationships are apparent between sleep and psychosocial 
health as noted earlier for adults.59 These findings must be 
interpreted with caution, however, as many studies of sleep 
disturbance in adolescents group together the effects of short 
sleep duration (a common complaint among adolescents) 
and sleep disruption.
Children
In a real-world study of 135 healthy children, diminished 
performance on neurobehavioral functioning measures (par-
ticularly those associated with more complex tasks, such as a 
continuous performance test and a symbol-digit substitution 
test) were found in children with fragmented sleep.70 Parents 
of these children also rated them as having more behavioral 
problems than those with continuous sleep. Other reported 
issues include psychiatric symptoms,71 social problems,72 
externalizing symptoms,71 and self-harm behaviors.73
Short-term consequences in individuals 
with underlying medical conditions
Reduced QoL
Of 159 children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease 
(pre-dialysis, dialysis, and transplant patients), 58.5% had 
symptoms of sleep disturbance, as measured by the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale.34 The presence of a sleep disturbance was 
most frequent in the dialysis group compared to the other 
groups,34 while sleep disturbance was associated with a 
significant decrease in the overall total QoL score on the 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Version 4.0 
Generic Core Scales for pre-dialysis and transplant subjects 
(P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively). A study of 47 pediat-
ric liver transplant recipients investigated the impact of sleep 
problems (as assessed by the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire) 
on HRQoL, as measured using the PedsQL.74 Sleep-related 
breathing disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness were 
prevalent, affecting ~23% and 40% of children in the study, 
respectively.74 According to the parent proxy and child self-
report, ~40% of participants had a substandard HRQoL. The 
physical manifestations of chronic diseases, such as chemical 
imbalances in dialysis patients, along with medications that 
may adversely affect sleep, play a role in sleep disruption 
and require comprehensive management to allow for effec-
tive sleep.34,74
Long-term health consequences of 
sleep disruption
Long-term consequences of sleep disruption in otherwise 
healthy individuals include hypertension, dyslipidemia, CVD, 
weight-related issues, metabolic syndrome, and T2DM. Evi-
dence suggests that sleep disruption may increase the risk of 
certain cancers and death. Sleep disruption may also worsen 
the symptoms of some gastrointestinal disorders.
Long-term consequences in otherwise 
healthy individuals
Cardiovascular
The increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system 
that is associated with sleep deprivation has substantial 
long-term consequences for adults and adolescents.45,47,75–79 
Adults who experienced sleep disruption had elevated BP70 
and an increased risk of developing hypertension.76–78 A meta-
analysis of data from four prospective cohort studies found 
that the relative risk of incident hypertension was 1.20 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.06–1.36) in adults with sleep con-
tinuity disturbance, with equal effects in men and women.45 
In adolescents, higher sleep disturbance scores on the PSQI 
were associated with higher cholesterol, higher body mass 
index (BMI), higher systolic BP
, and an increased risk of 
hypertension.79 Two large, population-based studies assessed 
the association between CVD and sleep disruption.76,80 In 
the prospective, population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities (ARIC) Study, incident CVD was observed 
in patients who experienced sleep continuity disturbance in 
combination with difficulty falling asleep and nonrestorative 
sleep (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1–2.0).76 An association between 
difficulty maintaining sleep or short sleep duration and 
incident myocardial infarction was observed in middle-aged 
women who participated in the MONICA/KORA Augsburg 
Cohort Study.80 Despite differences in study design and 
populations enrolled, these studies extend the literature to 
suggest that the effects of sleep disruption on sympathetic 
activity, glucose metabolism, and possibly inflammation may 
lead to adverse cardiovascular effects.80

ciation between sleep disruption and metabolic disorders, 
including obesity and T2DM. Sleep loss appears to affect 
energy metabolism primarily by impairing insulin sensitivity 
and increasing food intake.81 Disrupted sleep has been associ-
ated with weight gain and other weight-related issues in both 
adults82,83 and adolescents.79 A 5-year ancillary study nested 
within the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Y
oung 
Adults (CARDIA) study showed that sleep fragmentation was 
strongly associated with increases in BMI.82 A common cause 
of sleep disruption is shift work, which has been implicated 
in high BP and increased stress.20 A 14-year longitudinal 
study in male Japanese workers showed that alternating shift 
work increased the rate of everyday drinking, smoking, and 
absence of habitual exercise and also heightened the risk 
of increasing BMI.83 In adolescents, sleep disruption was 
associated with a high BMI z-score, being overweight, and 
having a high waist circumference percentile.79
The results of experimental studies in healthy volunteers 
suggest that, independent of sleep duration, sleep fragmenta-
tion can alter glucose homeostasis.9 In an experimental study 
in healthy young adults, sleep disruption (characterized by 
three nights of SWS suppression) resulted in decreased insu-
lin sensitivity, which was similar to that reported for popula-
tions at high risk of T2DM, and reduced glucose tolerance.9 
Other experimental studies showed that sleep fragmentation 
resulted in reduced insulin sensitivity, reduced glucose effec-
tiveness (defined as the ability of glucose to mobilize itself 
independent of an insulin response), and increased cortisol 
levels.84,85 Large longitudinal studies have shown that sleep 
disruption is associated with an increased risk of developing 
T2DM.78,86–89 A meta-analysis of four of these studies86–89 
found that the overall relative risk of developing T2DM was 
1.84 (95% CI, 1.39–2.43; P < 0.0001) in adults who experi-
enced difficulty maintaining sleep.90
The coexistence of obesity, elevated BP and glucose 
levels, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
defines the metabolic syndrome.91 An observational, cross-
sectional study compared global scores on the PSQI with 
concurrently collected measures of metabolic syndrome 
components.91 Poor global sleep-quality scores on the PSQI 
were related significantly to the presence of metabolic syn-
drome, and the PSQI global sleep-quality score was signifi-
cantly related to waist circumference, BMI, percentage of 
body fat, serum levels of insulin and glucose, and estimated 
insulin resistance.
The accumulating evidence points to the importance of 
regular sleep for normal metabolic functioning and preven-
tion of the metabolic syndrome.81 The metabolic effects of 
sleep disruption appear to manifest in both the brain and 
peripheral organs. The effects of sleep disruption on appetite, 
glucose metabolism, and diabetes risk are critical to under-
standing the epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease. It 
has even been suggested that sleep may be an appropriate 
therapeutic target for treatment and prevention of obesity 
and diabetes.81
Cancer
Disruption of circadian rhythm and sleep deprivation have 
been shown to accelerate tumor formation12 and may increase 
the risk of cancer.12,92 Exposure to light at night decreases 
production of melatonin, which may lead to increased pro-
duction of reproductive hormones.93 Melatonin has other 
important properties, including DNA repair, inhibition of 
tumor growth, and acting as a potent free-radical scaven-
ger.92,94 A study in mice subjected to suprachiasmatic nuclei 
destruction showed that disruption of circadian coordination 
accelerated malignant growth, which suggests that the host 
circadian clock controls tumor progression95 and provides a 
potential mechanistic reason for this association.
With regard to clinical data, night shift work has been 
associated with an increased risk of cancer. In the Nurses’ 
Health Study, 602 incident cases of colorectal cancer were 
documented among 78,586 women who were followed 
over 10 years.93 Compared with women who never worked 
rotating night shifts, women who worked 1–14 years or 
≥15 years on rotating night shifts had multivariate relative 
risks of colorectal cancer of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.84–1.19) and 
1.35 (95% CI, 1.03–1.77), respectively (Ptrend = 0.04). These 
data suggest that extended night shift work may increase 
the risk of colorectal cancer. Moreover, men who suffered 
from severe problems of falling and staying asleep were 
about twice as likely to develop prostate cancer as those 
without insomnia.92
A recent large nested case–control study from Taiwan 
determined an increased risk of cancer among patients 
with sleep disorders compared with those without sleep 
disorders.96 In this study, sleep disorders were separated 
into three categories: insomnia, parasomnia, and obstructive 
sleep apnea, all of which can contribute to sleep disruption. 
The risk of breast cancer was increased for patients with 
each of these types of disorder (adjusted hazard ratio 1.73 
[95% CI, 1.57–1.90] for insomnia, 2.76 [95% CI, 1.53–5.00] 
for parasomnia, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.16–3.80] for obstructive 
sleep apnea). There was also a higher risk of nasal cancer 
and prostate cancer in patients with obstructive sleep apnea 
compared with those without sleep disruptions.

Medic et al
The mechanisms responsible for carcinogenesis in sleep-
disrupted individuals are not clear, and much of the work is 
focused on nighttime light exposure and decreased melatonin 
levels.92,93 Additional research is required to determine the 
effect and etiology of sleep disruption on cancer risk.
Death
In the GAZEL cohort study that assessed sleep disturbances 
using the 5-item sleep dimension from the Nottingham 
Health Profile, sleep disturbance was associated with a 
higher all-cause risk of mortality in men (P = 0.005), but 
not in women (P = 0.33). In particular, men who reported 
sleep disruption on the Nottingham Health Profile (“I 
sleep badly at night”) had a higher all-cause mortality 
risk compared with those who did not report sleep disrup-
tion (hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.25–2.31).78 In a study 
in which the family and friends of adolescent suicide 
completers reported sleep disturbances for the deceased, 
history of sleep disturbances, including middle insomnia, 
was significantly associated with suicide compared with 
matched community controls.97 The effect remained sig-
nificant when controlling for current affective disorders 
and severity of depressive symptoms.
The high correlation between sleep disturbances, depres-
sion, and suicidal ideation may play a role in identifying an 
increased risk of mortality in these studies. Other studies 
have linked sleep disorders to mortality through an increase 
in cardiovascular deaths, which have also been related to 
sleep disruption. Additional studies are needed in larger 
cohorts and controlling for confounding factors. Importantly, 
hypertension and diabetes may not explain death in younger 
individuals with sleep disruption, but the association of sleep 
disruption with these factors is a risk factor for mortality in 
later life.78
Long-term consequences in individuals 
with underlying medical conditions
The interdependent relationship between sleep and the 
immune system may be a factor in the effect of sleep abnor-
malities on common gastrointestinal disorders. Sleep disrup-
tion may worsen symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, 
irritable bowel syndrome, and gastroesophageal reflux dis-
ease.12 Conversely, these same gastrointestinal disorders can 
also contribute to sleep disruption. As seen with many other 
consequences of sleep disruption, the bidirectional interplay 
between sleep disruption and gastrointestinal disorders pro-
vides the opportunity for clinicians to treat both conditions 
for improved patient outcomes.
Conclusion
Disrupted sleep is a pervasive problem, with numerous 
contributing factors from lifestyle and environmental fac-
tors to psychosocial issues and iatrogenic effects. Sleep 
is vital to most major physiologic processes, and, as such, 
sleep disruption has vast potential for adverse short- and 
long-term health consequences in otherwise healthy indi-
viduals as well as those with underlying medical conditions. 
In healthy individuals, short-term consequences include a 
heightened stress response; pain; depression; anxiety; and 
cognition, memory, and performance deficits. In adoles-
cents and children, disrupted sleep can lead to poor school 
performance and behavior problems. Reduced QoL may be 
a short-term consequence of sleep disruption in otherwise 
healthy individuals and those with an underlying medical 
condition. Long-term consequences for otherwise healthy 
individuals include hypertension, dyslipidemia, CVD, weight 
gain, metabolic syndrome, and T2DM. There is also evidence 
that sleep disruption may increase the risk of certain cancers 
and death in males and suicidal adolescents. Long-term sleep 
disruption may also worsen the symptoms of a variety of 
gastrointestinal disorders.
Ultimately, it has been suggested that the physiologic 
consequences of disrupted sleep may be just as damaging as 
those of short sleep duration.5 Given the detrimental impact 
of disrupted sleep, it is important for health care profes-
sionals to effectively treat symptoms of underlying medical 
conditions to optimize sleep continuity. In addition, when 
possible, health care providers should consider prescribing 
interventions that minimize disruptions to sleep continuity,25 
such as medications with a long dosing interval.
