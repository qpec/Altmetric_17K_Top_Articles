Obesity impairs the relaxant capacity of adipose tissue surrounding the vasculature (PVAT) and has 
been implicated in resultant obesity-related hypertension and impaired glucose intolerance. Resident 
immune cells are thought to regulate adipocyte activity. We investigated the role of eosinophils in 
mediating normal PVAT function. Healthy PVAT elicits an anti-contractile effect, which was lost in 
mice deficient in eosinophils, mimicking the obese phenotype, and was restored upon eosinophil 
reconstitution. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that the loss of PVAT function was due to reduced 
bioavailability of adiponectin and adipocyte-derived nitric oxide, which was restored after eosinophil 
reconstitution. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that adiponectin and nitric oxide are released after 
activation of adipocyte-expressed β3 adrenoceptors by catecholamines, and identified eosinophils as 
a novel source of these mediators. We conclude that adipose tissue eosinophils play a key role in the 
regulation of normal PVAT anti-contractile function.
Most of the peripheral circulation is invested by a layer of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT)1, which comprises 
adipocytes, stromal cells and immune cells. In health, PVAT confers an anti-contractile effect on the vasculature 
through a balance of adipocyte-derived pro- and anti-contractile factors (including adiponectin2) and immune 
cell populations3, as well as contributing to the regulation of physiological processes, including glucose homeo-
stasis and lipid metabolism. In response to sustained caloric excess, there is adipocyte enlargement, hypoxia and 
subsequent PVAT inflammation leading to increased arterial tone4, which has profound effects on peripheral 
resistance5 and nutritive flow6, thereby linking obesity-associated hypertension7 and type 2 diabetes with vascular 
dysfunction8.
The involvement of immune cells in metabolic events in adipose tissue has come to the forefront of obesity 
research (reviewed in ref. 9). The contribution of eosinophils to the regulation of physiological events in these 
tissues, under steady state and in the inflammatory setting, is undefined; increased knowledge in this area is an 
unmet need with important implications for the treatment of obesity-associated disorders. Historically, eosino-
phils have been viewed as end-stage effector cells associated with Th2 inflammatory disorders such as parasitic 
infections and allergies, where they become activated and release cytotoxic granule proteins10. However, recent 
reports demonstrate that eosinophils are steady state constituents of the cellular pool in several organs, including 
the gastrointestinal tract11 and adipose tissue, and play a role in metabolic homeostasis12. Despite this, little atten-
tion has been paid to the direct role that eosinophils may play in adipose tissue function. We employed mouse 
models of eosinophil-deficiency and reconstitution, complemented by in vitro studies, to address the significance 
of eosinophils on PVAT function and vascular reactivity. For the first time, we have identified a central role for 
eosinophils in the maintenance of healthy PVAT functionality. Mechanistically, we define the release of nitric 
oxide as well as adiponectin, as central in regulation of PVAT anti-contractile function, and importantly identify

Results
Healthy PVAT exerts an anti-contractile effect that is lost in obesity. 
Initially, we compared the 
vascular reactivity in healthy twelve-week old C57BL/6 mice fed standard chow to mice on a high fat diet (HFD). 
In mice on standard chow, contractile responses of small mesenteric arteries (approximately 200 μm internal 
diameter) to cumulative doses of norepinephrine (NE) showed that vascular constriction was reduced in the 
presence of PVAT, compared with vessels from the same mouse in the absence of PVAT (P = 0.001; Fig. 1a). In 
contrast, in age-matched obese C57BL/6 mice fed a HFD, the anti-contractile capacity of PVAT was completely 
abolished, with no difference in contractility to NE whether PVAT was intact or removed (Fig. 1a).
Histological analyses of PVAT demonstrated significant adipocyte hypertrophy in HFD mice compared with 
standard chow fed control mice (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1b,c). Furthermore, immunohistochemical and flow cytometric 
analyses of enzymatically digested mesenteric adipose tissue demonstrated a significant reduction in the number 
of eosinophils present in HFD mice compared with chow fed age-matched controls (P = 0.0113; Fig. 1d,e and data 
not shown), consistent with previous reports12. Thus, impaired vascular function in HFD mice is associated with 
a dramatic reduction in the number of adipose tissue eosinophils.
Eosinophils contribute directly to the regulation of vascular tone. 
Anti-contractile PVAT func-
tion is lost in eosinophil-deficient ΔdblGATA-1 mice. To further investigate the role of eosinophils in vascular 
function we analyzed eosinophil-deficient ∆dblGATA-1 mice13. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that eosin-
ophils reside constitutively within mesenteric adipose tissue of wildtype (WT) mice (mean: 4.5% of all CD45+ 
cells, ± SD: 2.9%; n = 11), but are absent in ΔdblGATA-1 mice (Fig. 2a). As changes in perivascular adipose tissue 
has been shown to alter vascular function14 we examined the contractile and dilator response of small mesenteric 
arteries of ΔdblGATA-1 mice and their WT littermate controls by wire myography. In contrast with WT mice, in 
which there was a significant anti-contractile effect of PVAT (WT mice, PVAT vs. no PVAT: P < 0.0001, n = 15) 
(Fig. 2b), there was no PVAT-mediated anti-contractile effect to cumulative doses of NE in ΔdblGATA-1 mice 
(ΔdblGATA-1 mice, PVAT vs. no PVAT: P = NS, n = 15) (Fig. 2b). We additionally analyzed vessels with and 
without PVAT from IL-5 Tg mice that have excessive numbers of eosinophils and showed that IL-5 Tg arteries 
with or without PVAT responded in the same manner as WT arteries (Fig. S1a,b). Additionally, we observed 
that ΔdblGATA-1 mice had increased peripheral mean arterial blood pressure by an occlusion tail-cuff system 
(CODA) (P < 0.046; Fig. S1c) and elevated fasting blood glucose (P = 0.0106; Fig. S1d) compared with their lit-
termate controls. Overall our data suggest that eosinophils are required for the PVAT-mediated regulation of 
vascular function.
Eosinophil reconstitution restores normal PVAT function. To confirm that changes in PVAT function in 
ΔdblGATA-1 mice were attributable to eosinophil-deficiency we performed eosinophil reconstitution (AdBac) 
by intravenous injection of purified eosinophils. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that donor eosinophils local-
ized to the adipose tissue of the mesenteric bed (Fig. 2a), as well as perigonadal adipose tissue and the small and 
large intestine (data not shown). Thirty days after eosinophil reconstitution functional evaluation of mesenteric 
vessels with and without PVAT to NE-stimulation further demonstrated that reconstitution of eosinophils com-
pletely restored the loss of PVAT-associated anti-contractile capacity (P = 0.0023; Fig. 2c) to levels comparable 
with WT controls (data not shown). The restoration of the anti-contractile capacity of PVAT following eosinophil 
reconstitution was independent of effects on smooth muscle, because neither AdBac nor ΔdblGATA-1 vessels 
devoid of PVAT had any significant differences in response to NE stimulation (Fig. 2c), demonstrating that the 
effect of eosinophils is mediated via PVAT. Moreover, a restoration of both peripheral MAP and blood glucose to 
WT levels was observed in ΔdblGATA-1 following reconstitution with eosinophils (MAP: WT vs. ΔdblGATA-1, 
P = 0.025; WT vs. AdBac: P = NS) (Fig. S1e; data not shown).
Eosinophils do not influence SMA+ pericytes or other immune populations. Further analysis of ΔdblGATA-1 
mice showed no differences in the proportion of splenic or blood dendritic cells, neutrophils and monocytes 
compared with WT animals (Fig. S2b and c). In addition, we examined hemoglobulin (HGB) and hematocrit 
(HCT) levels and red blood cell (RBC) counts in ∆dblGATA-1 and age- and sex-matched littermate control mice, 
as these parameters were reported to be affected in eosinophil-deficient mice13. While the levels of RBCs (RBC 
(WT vs is ΔdblGATA-1): 9.7 ± 0.2 vs. 8.8 ± 0.2 /109 cells/mL; P = 0.0338) were reduced in ∆dblGATA-1 mice, 
consistent with previous reports13, we detected no significant difference in the hemoglobulin (HGB: 140.6 ± 3.6 
vs. 130.0 ± 3.3 g/L) or hematocrit (HCT: 0.51 ± 0.01 vs. 0.48 ± 0.01 L/L) levels.
Pericytes, including smooth muscle actin (SMA)+ contractile pericytes, are localized in the perivascular area, 
and are thought to be involved in vascular maintenance and function, including regulation of vascular constric-
tion15,16. We therefore determined the frequency of pericytes in enzymatically digested mesenteric adipose tissue 
from WT and ΔdblGATA-1 mice. We detected no difference in the frequency of total or SMA+ contractile peri-
cytes in ΔdblGATA-1 compared with WT mice (Fig. 2d and Fig. S2a). Similarly, we observed no difference in the 
total weight of the mesenteric adipose tissue between WT and ΔdblGATA-1 mice (Fig. 2e). Eosinophils have also 
been shown to affect macrophage functionality in adipose tissue12, and adipose tissue macrophages have in turn 
been shown to influence PVAT function14. To ascertain whether the altered vascular function in ΔdblGATA-1 
mice could be attributed indirectly to a loss of eosinophil-mediated modulation of macrophage activation, we 
performed flow cytometry analysis of enzymatically digested mesenteric adipose tissue from ΔdblGATA-1 and 
WT mice. Macrophages were defined as live CD45+ F4/80+ CD11b+ CD64+ MHC-II+ Ly6G− cells, and were fur-
ther examined for expression of markers associated with alternatively activated macrophages (AAM), RELMα/

FIZZ-1 and CD20617,18 (Fig. S2d). We detected no difference in the frequency and number of total CD45+ CD64+ 
CD11b+ MHC-II+ Ly6G− macrophages in the mesenteric adipose tissue between WT and ∆dblGATA-1 mice 
(Fig. 2f) and, similarly, found no difference in the number of macrophages expressing RELMα and CD206, two 
markers associated with alternatively activated macrophages17,18 (defined as CD45+ F4/80+ CD64+ CD11b+ 
MHC-II+ Ly6G− RELMα+ CD206+ cells) (Fig. 2g). Analysis of adipose tissue by qPCR also revealed no differ-
ences in levels of the AAM markers arginase-1, fizz-1 and ym-1 between ΔdblGATA-1 and WT mice (Fig. S2e–g). 
Taken together, these data suggest that alterations in pericyte or macrophage composition, or adipose tissue 
hypertrophy, do not explain the impaired vascular reactivity in ΔdblGATA-1 mice, indicating that eosinophils 
may be directly involved in the regulation of PVAT function rather than acting via other cell populations.
Eosinophils influence vascular reactivity via PVAT-mediated release of soluble mediators. 
To 
determine whether eosinophils directly influence PVAT function to modulate downstream vascular reac-
tivity, purified eosinophils were added to pre-constricted (1 × 10−5 M NE) mesenteric arteries ± PVAT from 
ΔdblGATA-1 mice. The addition of purified eosinophils (100 to 30,000 cells) was associated with a significantly 
greater dose dependent relaxation in vessels with PVAT compared with vessels without PVAT (P < 0.0001) 
(Fig. 3a). Relaxation occurred within 30 seconds of addition of eosinophils to the organ bath, demonstrating a 
rapid effect of eosinophils at both the vascular and perivascular level in vitro (Fig. 3b). In contrast, addition of 
10,000 purified macrophages had no PVAT-dependent relaxant effect (data not shown). Indeed, relaxation was

eosinophils were added to mesenteric arteries preconstricted with norepinephrine (10−5 M). Relaxation was 
measured by wire myography. (a) Exogenous application of eosinophils induced dose-dependent relaxation

attenuated at higher eosinophil concentrations (100,000 to 1,000,000 eosinophils), which may be associated with 
concentrations of eosinophils beyond normal physiological levels resulting in the production of oxygen free rad-
icals19 and subsequent vascular constriction20.
To establish whether eosinophils promoted the release of a soluble anti-contractile factor(s) from PVAT, organ 
bath solution transfer experiments were performed. Total organ bath solution from pre-constricted (1 × 10−5 M 
NE) small mesenteric arteries was transferred from donor arteries (with PVAT) to recipient arteries (without 
PVAT). These experiments demonstrated that healthy WT PVAT secretes a soluble relaxing factor (Fig. 3c)21. 
However, relaxation was impaired when solution from ΔdblGATA-1 donor arteries was transferred to WT recip-
ient arteries (ΔdblGATA-1 to WT, P = 0.049; Fig. 3c). Furthermore, transfer studies between WT donor arter-
ies and ΔdblGATA-1 recipient arteries demonstrated reduced relaxation compared with WT control solution 
transfer (data not shown). Importantly, in vivo reconstitution with eosinophils restored normal PVAT function. 
Thus, vessel relaxation was restored to the same levels as WT to WT transfer in both donor and recipient AdBac 
transfers with WT vessels (Fig. 3c and data not shown). These data implicate a role for eosinophils in mediating 
the secretion of a soluble relaxant factor(s) by PVAT.
To determine whether the relaxant effect of eosinophils was due to the release of eosinophil-derived soluble 
factors or via direct eosinophil interaction with PVAT, relaxation of C57BL/6 mesenteric arteries + PVAT was 
compared following application of 10,000 NE-stimulated eosinophils or the filtered supernatant from 10,000 
NE-stimulated eosinophils. The filtered eosinophil supernatant was capable of inducing relaxation of mesen-
teric vessels to the same extent as the addition of eosinophils (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, to ensure that our results 
were not due to an effect of NE-dilution when eosinophils are added to NE-preconstricted arteries, eosinophils 
were added in a buffer containing 1 × 10−5 M NE. However, as eosinophils express adrenergic receptors22 and 
could potentially respond to NE; we examined the effect of NE-treatment on eosinophils. Supernatant from 
10,000 eosinophils stimulated with 1 × 10−5 M NE or supernatant from unstimulated eosinophils supplemented 
with 1 × 10−5 M NE was added to ΔdblGATA-1 arteries with PVAT. The NE-supplemented supernatant from 
unstimulated eosinophils induced a significantly reduced relaxation of the mesenteric vessels in comparison with 
NE-stimulated eosinophils (P = 0.0068; Fig. 3e), suggesting that eosinophil stimulation with NE is important 
in mediating eosinophil-induced vascular relaxation. Collectively, these data implicate a soluble factor released 
from NE-stimulated eosinophils, rather than cell to cell contact, in mediating eosinophil-induced PVAT function.
Eosinophils act via adrenergic stimulation of nitric oxide and adiponectin release. 
Our previ-
ous data have shown that adiponectin4,21 and nitric oxide23 are important in mediating normal PVAT relaxing 
function. Furthermore, IL-4 is a previously recognised eosinophil-derived effector molecule. Therefore, we tested 
the functional role of these putative mediators on the vascular reactivity of vessels in response to the addition 
of 10,000 eosinophils. To this end, mesenteric vessels + PVAT isolated from ∆dblGATA-1 mice and/or purified 
eosinophils were incubated with the NO-signalling inhibitor L-NMMA (1 × 10−5 M)23, adiponectin blocking 
peptide (ABP; a soluble fragment of the Type-1 adiponectin receptor; 5 μg/mL)4 or anti-IL-4 antibody (0.4 μg/mL) 
for 30 minutes before pre-constriction of the vessels with 10−5 M NE and addition of 10,000 stimulated eosino-
phils (1 × 10−5 M NE). Incubation of vessel + PVAT alone with ABP and L-NMMA, but not anti-IL-4, reduced 
eosinophil-induced relaxation (ABP vs control, P < 0.01; L-NMMA vs control, P < 0.05; Fig. 4a), whereas 
incubation of eosinophils alone with the inhibitors had no effect on relaxation (data not shown). There was 
also a significant reduction in relaxation observed following incubation of both vessels and eosinophils with 
L-NMMA and ABP, but not anti-IL-4, compared with the addition of stimulated eosinophils alone (L-NMMA 
vs. control: P < 0.01; ABP vs. control: P < 0.001; Fig. 4b). In contrast, incubation of eosinophils, vessel or 
eosinophils and vessels with the inhibitors in the absence of PVAT failed to alter relaxation of the arteries to 
NE-stimulated eosinophils (data not shown). Similarly, addition of D-NMMA, IgG or a control peptide (the 
negative controls for L-NMMA, anti-IL-4 and ABP, respectively) to vessels + PVAT had no effect on PVAT 
function (data not shown).
To examine if eosinophils could act as source of NO or adiponectin, we performed eosinophil reconstitution 
experiments using bone marrow-derived eosinophils from WT, iNOS−/− or adiponectin−/− mice. PVAT vessels 
from reconstituted mice showed a loss of anti-contractile function following reconstitution with adiponectin−/− 
eosinophils, but not iNOS−/− or WT eosinophils (adipo−/− vs WT: P = 0.0085; Fig. 4c and d). Collectively, these 
data suggest that adiponectin and NO signalling are critical components of the regulation of vascular activity, 
and further, that eosinophils may act as a source of adiponectin, as well as inducing the release of downstream 
adiponectin from PVAT, resulting in relaxation of vessels via NO-dependent mechanisms.
Given the rapid effect on PVAT function following addition of eosinophils (Fig. 3b), we hypothesized that 
eosinophils may directly exert their effect via adrenoreceptors. To explore this idea, we incubated mesenteric 
vessels + PVAT with eosinophils in the presence or absence of antagonists of β1-β3, α1 or β3 adrenoreceptors. 
After addition of antagonists against β1-β3 or α1 adrenoreceptors, there was no inhibition of relaxation in the 
presence of exogenous PVAT or exogenous PVAT with eosinophils (Fig. 5a). In contrast, a specific β3 adrenore-
ceptor antagonist (SR-592,30 A)24 significantly reduced relaxation in the presence of exogenous PVAT or exog-
enous PVAT with eosinophils (β3 adrenoreceptor antagonist vs. time control, P < 0.001 and β3 adrenoreceptor 
antagonist vs. vessel control, P < 0.05; Fig. 5a). Moreover, the direct addition of the β3 adrenoreceptor agonist 
(CL-316,243)25 to ΔdblGATA-1 arteries with PVAT resulted in a significant relaxation of these vessels in com-
parison to control ΔdblGATA-1 arteries with PVAT (P < 0.001; Fig. 5b), suggesting that this elicits the same 
response as the addition of eosinophils. The only known agonists of β3 adrenoreceptors are catecholamines, the 
production of which is critically dependent on the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase26. As our data demonstrated that 
eosinophils secrete a soluble factor that mediates a relaxant effect on PVAT, we hypothesised that eosinophils may 
be a source of catecholamines. Immunocytochemical staining revealed high expression of tyrosine hydroxylase 
in eosinophil granules (Fig. 5c). To examine the functional significance of this, 10,000 eosinophils were incubated

with or without a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor (AMPT). Addition of eosinophils pre-incubated with AMPT 
to mesenteric vessels + PVAT isolated from ∆dblGATA-1 mice resulted in a significantly decreased relaxation 
compared to untreated eosinophils (P = 0.0472; Fig. 5d). Finally, we demonstrated that eosinophils are able to 
constitutively produce epinephrine, NE and dopamine, and with a trend towards increased NE and dopamine 
secretion following activation of eosinophils with IL-5 and eotaxin (Fig. 5e). Together these data demonstrate that 
PVAT functionality depends on tyrosine hydroxylase-dependent eosinophil production of catecholamines that 
signal via PVAT-located β3 adrenoreceptors.
Discussion
The anti-contractile function of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is lost in obesity, a disorder with an underly-
ing immunological component9,27 that has been linked with increased peripheral vascular resistance and elevated 
peripheral blood pressure5,7. While a role of eosinophils in regulation of these events have not previously been 
recognized, our data identify mechanisms by which obesity-induced alterations to the eosinophil population may 
perturb the influence from PVAT on small arteries and the physiological consequences thereof4,6. Thus, for the 
first time, we demonstrate that eosinophils play a central role in the release of vasorelaxing factors from healthy 
PVAT, via the release of eosinophil-derived catecholamines, to mediate adipocyte-localised β3 adrenoceptor acti-
vation and downstream adiponectin- and nitric oxide-signalling (Fig. 5 – Fig. Sup. 1). Loss of PVAT function 
was also associated with increased arterial tone, with a potential role of eosinophils in the regulation of these 
processes being further supported by our observations that hypertensive eosinophil-deficient mice recovered 
upon eosinophil reconstitution. Furthermore, the loss of a vasodilatory paracrine effect from adipose tissue has 
been suggested to limit downstream microcirculatory nutritive flow6, thereby contributing to insulin resistance

and metabolic dysregulation. It is clear from these studies that eosinophils play a vital role in sustaining normal 
PVAT function in health to maintain adipose tissue homeostasis, which have important downstream physiolog-
ical consequences.
Previous work to understand the mechanisms responsible for the anti-contractile effect of PVAT have focused 
attention on the macrophage14, whilst other leukocyte populations have largely been ignored. Eosinophils have 
previously been shown to be indirectly involved in regulation of events in adipose tissue by controlling adipose 
tissue macrophage functionality12, which in turn can influence PVAT function in inflammation14. For example 
in obesity, factors such as tissue hypoxia and aldosterone signaling are thought to alter macrophage activation, 
which subsequently impacts on PVAT anti-contractile function, manifesting in hypertension14. Macrophages 
have also been shown to play a role in beiging of fat and thermoregulation28. A recent report implicated eosin-
ophils in regulation of the polarization of white adipose tissue macrophages to an AAM phenotype. Thus, Wu 
et al.12 detected a decrease in a subpopulation of YFP+ macrophages expressing high levels of CD11b and F4/80 
in the perigonadal adipose tissue of ΔdblGATA-1 BALB/c mice crossed with mice expressing YFP under the 
arginase-1 promoter. In apparent contrast to these results, we detected no change in the frequency of total or 
AAM in the mesenteric adipose tissue of ΔdblGATA-1 compared with WT mice. Although the reason for this 
discrepancy is not entirely clear, we speculate that differences in the source of adipose tissue or analysis may 
underlie the difference. Thus, while Wu et al. examined a population of GFP-positive cells among a population 
of F4/80hi CD11bhi perigonadal adipose tissue macrophages in arginase-reporter mice12, we analyzed expression 
of RELMα and CD206 on total CD11b+ CD64+ mesenteric adipose tissue macrophages. Consistent with our 
flow cytometry analysis, qPCR analysis of mesenteric adipose tissue from WT or ΔdblGATA-1 mice revealed 
no differences in the expression of arginase-1, fizz-1 or ym-1. Finally, we also addressed a potential role of IL-4 in 
PVAT function, as IL-4 secretion from eosinophils has been proposed to be a key mechanism by which eosino-
phils sustain AAM and regulate glucose homeostasis12. However, neutralization of IL-4 had no impact on vessel 
reactivity in our system. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that macrophages may indirectly contribute 
to PVAT function, the current study demonstrate that eosinophils contribute to regulation of vascular function 
directly, by release of catecholamines that act rapidly via PVAT to promote vessel relaxation. This appears to be a 
unique function of eosinophils, and cannot be mediated by other immune cells, including macrophages. Taken 
together we conclude that eosinophils exert an effect on healthy PVAT function directly, and independently of 
other immune cell populations.
Adipocytes and eosinophils are known to secrete a number of adipokines and cytokines, which influence 
downstream biological responses10,12,29. The balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines is important in 
mediating the anti-contractile capacity, energy homeostasis and inflammatory status of PVAT. Ours and others’ 
previous data in humans and rodent species (rats and mice) have shown that adiponectin4,21 and nitric oxide sign-
aling23,30 are important in mediating normal PVAT function. Thus, adiponectin-deficient mice demonstrate a loss 
of PVAT function in response to adrenergic stimulation21 and have been shown to be hypertensive31. Furthermore, 
healthy PVAT-induced vascular relaxation is attenuated by inhibition of NO, and NO signaling is dysregulated in 
a rat model of the metabolic syndrome associated with enhanced vasoconstriction to norepinephrine30. Indeed 
in line with this, we confirmed that adiponectin and NO signaling were essential for the anti-contractile function 
of PVAT also in mice, and that eosinophils were necessary for promoting the adiponectin- and NO-dependent 
anti-contractile function of PVAT. Furthermore, to examine if eosinophils could act as a direct source of NO or 
adiponectin, we performed in vivo reconstitution experiments using eosinophils generated from WT, iNOS−/− or 
adiponectin−/− mice. Interestingly, our experiments revealed that eosinophil-derived adiponectin, but not NO, 
contributed to the anti-contractile capacity of PVAT. Thus, our data suggest that eosinophils may act as a source 
of adiponectin as well as inducing the release of downstream adiponectin from PVAT, resulting in relaxation of 
vessels via NO-dependent mechanisms.
The eosinophil cytoplasm contains numerous preformed granules containing a variety of effector molecules; 
therefore we hypothesized that eosinophils may act on PVAT via secreted factors. In support of this hypothesis, 
addition of filtered eosinophil supernatant to vessels +PVAT mimicked the relaxant effect of eosinophil addition. 
Moreover, as the eosinophil-dependent effect was so rapid, we focused our studies on adrenoreceptor-mediated 
activation of PVAT rather than genomic manifestations of eosinophil-deficiency. Addition of a panel of adreno-
receptor inhibitors in our experimental model demonstrated that the vessel-relaxing interaction of eosino-
phils with PVAT occurred via the β3 adrenoreceptor, supporting a previous study that identified a role for β3 
adrenoreceptors in mediating the adipocyte-derived hyperpolarizing factor (ADRF)-induced hyperpolarization 
of smooth muscle25. Catecholamines are the only known activators of the β3 adrenoreceptor, and depend on 
the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase for their production26. Immunocytochemical analysis of purified eosinophils 
demonstrated that eosinophils indeed express this enzyme, which was necessary for the eosinophil-mediated 
effect on vascular reactivity. Furthermore, we showed that eosinophils constitutively secrete catecholamines. 
To our knowledge, this is the first time that eosinophils have been reported to express tyrosine hydroxylase and 
secrete catecholamines.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate for the first time a direct role for eosinophils in regulation of adipose 
tissue functionality, further emphasizing the surprising contribution of eosinophils to physiological processes 
beyond immune function. We have demonstrated that eosinophils play a crucial role in mediating normal 
PVAT function, the dysfunction of which is associated with conditions such as hypertension and type 2 dia-
betes. Thus, eosinophil-deficiency within adipose tissue led to physiological consequences on vascular reactiv-
ity, independent of other immune cell populations. The effects on PVAT and vascular function are mediated 
via regulation of NO-signaling and release of adiponectin, following secretion of catecholamines that promote 
β3 adrenoreceptor-dependent PVAT anti-contractile function (Fig. 5, Supplement 1). We propose the follow-
ing model for regulation of vessel reactivity by eosinophils (see also Fig. 5, Supplement 1): Eosinophils release 
catecholamines that stimulate adipocytes by signaling via beta 3-adrenoreceptors. In response to stimulation,

adipocytes produce adiponectin and NO, which subsequently act on the vascular smooth muscle to mediate 
vessel relaxation. Taken together, our data identifies eosinophils as novel targets for the development of therapies 
for obesity and related cardiovascular complications.
Methods
∆dblGATA-1, IL-5 Tg and littermate control mouse details, standard experimental procedures, and more detailed 
descriptions of protocols and analyses are presented in the online Supplemental Experimental Procedures-section. 
The IL5 Transgenics were from the laboratories of Drs Nancy and Jamie Lee.
Eosinophil purification and transfer. 
Eosinophils were purified from IL-5 Tg mice by negative selection 
using MACS columns or by cell sorting, and were approximately 95% pure irrespective of purification method 
(data not shown), as assessed by flow cytometry of CD11b+ SiglecF+ SSChigh cells. For adoptive transfers, eosin-
ophils were resuspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and 100–150 million cells injected intra-
venously, and recipient mice analysed 30 days after transfer. Bone marrow-derived eosinophils were grown as 
described previously32. After 12–14 days in culture the cells were >90% pure as determined by flow cytometry 
analysis; cells were resuspended in sterile PBS, and 1–3 million cells injected intravenously per mouse, and recip-
ient mice analysed five days after transfer.
Adipose tissue digest. 
For isolation of the adipose stromal vascular fraction (SVF), white mesenteric adi-
pose tissue was finely minced and incubated in medium containing 1 mg/mL type I collagenase and 30 μg/mL 
DNase I at 37 °C for 45 min with magnetic stirring at 350 rpm. The resulting cell suspension was spun to separate 
floating adipocytes from the SVF pellet, and passed through 40 μm filters to generate a single-cell suspension. 
Leukocytes were further enriched by density centrifugation using Percoll, followed by phenotypic and quantita-
tive analysis by flow cytometry.
Pharmacological assessment of vascular reactivity by wire myography. 
The mesenteric bed was 
removed and placed in ice-cold physiological salt solution (PSS); first-order arteries were identified and dissected 
clean of PVAT or left with surrounding PVAT intact as indicated. Vessels were mounted on a wire myograph, 
equilibrated, normalised and viability assessed as previously described4,23,33. Vascular contractility was assessed 
in vessels to increasing concentrations of norepinephrine (NE).
Solution transfer experiments were performed between wildtype (WT), IL-5 Tg, ∆dblGATA-1 and 
eosinophil-reconstituted ∆dblGATA-1 (AdBac) mice. Arteries were preconstricted with NE and a stable con-
striction established; next, total myograph bath solution (6 mLs) taken from donor arteries with PVAT were used 
to replace the solution from a recipient artery devoid of PVAT.
In order to investigate the direct effect of eosinophils on vascular contractility, the exogenous addition of 
(1 × 102 to 1 × 106) eosinophils to preconstricted mesenteric arteries (1 × 10−5 M NE) from ΔdblGATA-1 mice 
was assessed in the presence and absence of PVAT. To establish whether eosinophils interacted directly or indi-
rectly, the supernatant from NE-stimulated eosinophils was added to preconstricted vessels.
Adiponectin blocking peptide, L-NMMA, anti-IL-4, propranolol and SR-592,30 A or appropriate controls 
were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C with either eosinophils only, arteries ± PVAT, or both eosinophils and 
arteries (±PVAT). Both eosinophils and vessels were treated with NA (1 × 10−5 M) before addition of eosinophils 
to the vessels. The response to eosinophil addition was measured as a percentage relaxation.
Statistics. 
Differences in response to NE were expressed as a percentage of constriction to KPSS4,14,21,23; func-
tional differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using two-way ANOVA when appro-
priate, with the Bonferroni post-hoc test or one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett’s test when appropriate. 
All other statistical analysis was performed by student’s t-test, unless stated. P-values below 0.05 were consid-
ered significant (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated. 
GraphPad Prism, version 6.00 for Windows was used for data analysis.
Ethical approval. 
Procedures were performed in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific 
Procedures) Act of 1986, and conformed to the Directive 2010/63/EY of the European Parliament. Ethical per-
mission was obtained from the Local Ethical Committee at Lund University, Sweden, and the University of 
Manchester Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board and performed under a Home Office approved grant.
