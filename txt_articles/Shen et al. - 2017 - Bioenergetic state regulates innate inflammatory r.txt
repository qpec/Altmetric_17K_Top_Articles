The innate inflammatory response contributes to secondary injury in brain trauma and other
disorders. Metabolic factors such as caloric restriction, ketogenic diet, and hyperglycemia
influence the inflammatory response, but how this occurs is unclear. Here, we show that
glucose metabolism regulates pro-inflammatory NF-κB transcriptional activity through effects
on the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio and the NAD(H) sensitive transcriptional co-repressor
CtBP. Reduced glucose availability reduces the NADH:NAD+ ratio, NF-κB transcriptional
activity, and pro-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages and microglia. These effects
are inhibited by forced elevation of NADH, reduced expression of CtBP, or transfection
with an NAD(H) insensitive CtBP, and are replicated by a synthetic peptide that inhibits
CtBP dimerization. Changes in the NADH:NAD+ ratio regulate CtBP binding to the
acetyltransferase p300, and regulate binding of p300 and the transcription factor NF-κB to
pro-inflammatory gene promoters. These findings identify a mechanism by which alterations
in cellular glucose metabolism can influence cellular inflammatory responses.

icroglia and macrophages are innate immune respon-
ders to infection, tissue damage, and other stressors.
The early phase of this response involves release of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and metalloproteinases,
along with alterations in cell morphology and surface protein
expression1, 2. Although these responses are adaptive in the
setting of infection, they can be deleterious in non-infectious
injuries such as stroke and head trauma. Accordingly, factors
that suppress the acute inflammatory reaction also reduce tissue
loss and improve functional outcomes in animal models of
non-infectious brain injury3, 4.
Inflammatory responses are influenced at the transcriptional
level by factors that affect cellular bioenergetic state, such
as caloric restriction, ketogenic diet, and the glycolytic inhibitor
2-deoxyglucose (2DG)5, 6. Caloric restriction, ketogenic diet, and
2DG each produce a ketogenic state in which glucose utilization is
suppressed, and these conditions also reduce brain inflammation,
tissue loss, and functional impairment after brain injury7–12.
Conversely,
hypoxia
and
hyperglycemia
promote
glucose
utilization, exacerbate inflammation, and worsen outcomes after
brain injury13, 14.
How inflammation affects cell metabolism is well established15,
but less is known about how energy metabolism affects inflam-
matory
responses.
One
potential
mechanism
is
through
the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio, which is thermodynamically
coupled to glycolysis. The cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio is
decreased by ketogenic factors such as dietary restriction and
2DG, which decrease flux through glycolysis, and increased by
conditions such as hypoxia and hyperglycemia, which increase
flux through glycolysis. Cytosolic NADH and NAD+ are
physically separated from the mitochondrial metabolite pools,
but can move freely across the nuclear membrane to influence
transcriptional events.
Despite the fundamental roles of NAD+ and NADH in cell
metabolism, only a limited number of NADH-sensitive proteins
are known to affect gene transcription16. Among these are the
C-terminal
binding
proteins
(CtBP),
which
function
as
transcriptional
corepressors.
Mammals
express
two
CtBP
proteins, CtBP1 and CtBP2, that exhibit overlapping actions17, 18.
CtBP forms repressor complexes with histone deacetylases,
histone methyl transferases, E3 ligases, and other transcriptional
regulators19,
20.
Some
of
these
complexes
include
CtBP
homodimers or heterodimers, while others require CtBP in its
monomeric form21–24. CtBP in its monomeric form suppresses
the activity of the acetyltransferase p300/CBP20, which acetylates
both histones and the pro-inflammatory transcription factor,
NF-κB25. Increased NADH levels promote the formation of CtBP
dimers and higher order oligomers, and thereby modulate CtBP
association with its binding partners26.
Here, we investigate whether anti-inflammatory effects of
ketogenic metabolism may be mediated through an NADH/CtBP
signaling mechanism. We show that changes in cytosolic NADH:
NAD+ ratio influence inflammatory responses by regulating
NF-κB transcriptional activity through a mechanism requiring
CtBP dimerization. This process involves dissociation of p300
from CtBP and acetylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit.
Results
Microglial and macrophage activation is suppressed by 2DG.
The reduced glycolytic flux resulting from caloric restriction
and ketogenic diet can be mimicked by the glycolytic inhibitor
2DG27, 28. To determine whether 2DG can replicate the effect of
ketogenic diet on brain inflammatory responses, we treated
rats with intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or
with LPS + 2DG. The systemic LPS injection induced a robust
activation of brain microglia, and this was strikingly reduced by
co-administration of 2DG (Fig. 1a). In organotypic brain slice
cultures (Fig. 1b), 2DG likewise suppressed the effect of LPS on
microglial activation and on the expression of inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS), a hallmark of inflammatory activation
in microglia and macrophages29. Primary microglial cultures
similarly showed an attenuated response to LPS in the presence of
2DG (Fig. 1c), thus confirming that the effects of LPS and 2DG
on microglia are not dependent upon indirect, systemic effects of
these agents. This same pattern of responses was observed in the
RAW264.7 macrophage cell line. RAW264.7 cells treated with
LPS showed increased iNOS mRNA expression, iNOS protein
expression, and nitric oxide production, all of which were
attenuated by co-incubation with 2DG (Fig. 1d, e). RAW264.7
cells were used because, unlike primary microglia, they can be
efficiently transfected and are not readily activated by transfection
procedures. Glutamine was provided as an alternative energy
substrate in all of the in vitro studies, as glutamine is taken up
by cells and metabolized to the keto acid, α-ketoglutarate.
ATP measurements confirmed no significant effect of 2DG or
glucose-free
medium
on
ATP
levels
in
the
glutamine-
supplemented cell cultures (Fig. 1f).
Glycolytic inhibition reduces cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio. We
assessed the free cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio by measuring the
cellular lactate:pyruvate ratio30. This indirect approach has
advantages over direct biochemical measurements in that it is not
influenced by protein bound or mitochondrial NAD+ and
NADH30, 31. 2DG and glucose-free medium are predicted to
lower the cytosolic (i.e., non-mitochondrial) NADH:NAD+ ratio
by decreasing glucose flux through glycolysis, while impaired
respiration should increase glycolytic flux and elevate the
cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio (Fig. 2a). As expected, both 2DG
and glucose-free medium reduced the lactate:pyruvate ratio
(indicating a reduced free cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio), while
the respiratory inhibitors antimycin A and cobalt chloride
(CoCl2)27, 32 increased it (Fig. 2b). We then evaluated these
treatments
on
LPS-induced
iNOS
expression.
Glucose-free
medium suppressed LPS-induced iNOS expression to an extent
comparable to that seen with 2DG, while CoCl2 had the opposite
effect (Fig. 2c). These findings identify a correlation between
changes in the inflammatory response and changes in the NADH:
NAD+ ratio in response to metabolic factors.
Elevated NADH reverses the anti-inflammatory effect of 2DG.
We next asked whether the metabolic influences on the inflam-
matory responses are blocked when changes in the NADH:NAD+
ratio are negated. Lactate added to culture medium passes readily
into cultured cells33 and drives the NADH:NAD+ equilibrium
toward NADH (Fig. 2a), thus providing a means of countering
the effect of glycolytic inhibition on the cytosolic NADH:NAD+
ratio. The addition of sodium lactate (20 mM, pH 7.4) reversed
the effects
of glycolytic inhibition
on LPS-induced
iNOS
expression in the cell cultures (Fig. 3a, b). Evaluation of iNOS
gene transcription in cells transfected with an iNOS luciferase
reporter gene confirmed an effect at the level of iNOS gene
transcription (Fig. 3c).
The lactate:pyruvate ratio cannot be reliably measured in cells
treated with lactate, so for these studies we instead evaluated
changes in cytosolic NADH by measuring changes in intrinsic
NAD(P)H fluorescence. This approach does not distinguish
NADH from NADPH, but cellular NADPH levels are insensitive
to acute changes in glycolysis or lactate34, 35. Signal from
mitochondrial NAD(P)H was avoided by sampling only from
nuclei, which do not contain mitochondria (Fig. 3d). 2DG

 reduced the cytosolic NAD(P)H signal, in agreement with the
lactate:pyruvate ratio determinations; and as expected 2DG had
no effect on the mitochondrial NAD(P)H fluorescence (Fig. 3e).
Glucose-free medium had comparable effects (Fig. 3f). The effects
of both 2DG and glucose-free medium on NAD(P)H levels were
reversed by sodium lactate (20 mM, pH 7.4; Fig. 3f). Although
lactate did not produce a significant increase in NAD(P)H signal
when administered in the absence of 2DG (Fig. 3f), the
mitochondrial inhibitors cobalt and antimycin likewise failed to
increase the NAD(P)H signal. NADH fluorescence measurements
may be less sensitive to increases than to decreases in NADH
because increased NADH is disproportionately protein-unbound,
and NADH that is not protein bound has weaker intrinsic
fluorescence36.
2DG suppresses NF-κB activated pro-inflammatory genes. To
evaluate the broader effects of 2DG on LPS-induced gene expres-
sion, we prepared microarrays from RAW264.7 cells after
incubation under control, LPS, or LPS + 2DG conditions. Expres-
sion levels of 994 genes were significantly affected by LPS and 781
by LPS + 2DG, with 579 genes responding to both conditions
(Fig. 4a). An analysis of transcription factor binding sites on these
genes showed that conserved NF-κB family binding sites (Rel and
RelA/p65) were over-represented in the LPS + 2DG condition
(Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Data 1 and 2), as
would be expected given the dominant role of NF-κB in
pro-inflammatory transcriptional responses. RT-PCR quantifica-
tions of specific NF-κB—driven pro-inflammatory gene transcripts,
IL1B, IL6, and iNOS, confirmed that they were upregulated by LPS,
and that 2DG suppressed their upregulation (Figs. 1d, 4b).
The anti-inflammatory effect of 2DG is mediated by CtBP. We
next evaluated whether the NAD(H)-sensitive transcriptional
co-repressor, CtBP, is involved in the process by which energy
metabolism influences inflammation. We generated a stable CtBP
knockdown RAW264.7 cell line using lentivirus that expressed
shRNA targeting a sequence that, in mice, is present only in
CtBP1 and CtBP2. The CtBP knockdown cell line displayed a
98.9 ± 0.2 % reduction in CtBP1 and 80.8 ± 4% reduction in
CtBP2 transcripts, and a 64 ± 10% reduction in CtBP1/2 protein
expression (Fig. 5a). Like wild-type cells, CtBP knockdown
cells responded to LPS with increased iNOS expression and NO
production (though to a lesser extent); however, unlike wild-type
cells,
CtBP
knockdown
cells
showed
no
suppression
of
this response when treated with 2DG or glucose-free medium
(Fig. 5b, c). Similarly, the effect of 2DG on LPS-induced NF-κB
transcriptional activity was not observed in the CtBP knockdown
cells (Fig. 5d), nor was the effect of 2DG on LPS-induced iNOS,
IL-1b, and IL-6 gene expression (Fig. 5e; compare to Figs. 1d, 4b).
If transcriptional effects of cytoplasmic NADH:NAD+ ratio are
mediated by CtBP, then they should be diminished in cells
expressing an NAD(H)—insensitive CtBP. The G189A mutation
in CtBP2 disrupts its binding to NAD(H) while preserving its
co-repressor activity27. We therefore determined whether the
G189A mutation would negate the effect of NADH elevations
on NF-κB–mediated transcriptional responses. Studies were
performed in CtBP1−/−/CtBP2−/− MEF cells in order to eliminate
effects of endogenous CtBP1/2 (Fig. 6a), and because the shRNA
expressed by the stable CtBP knockdown RAW264.7 cell line
precludes expression of the mutant CtBP in those cells. The MEF
cells were transfected with either wild-type (WT) CtBP1, WT
CtBP2, or mutant G189A CtBP2 (Fig. 6a). Since the MEF cells
responded
only
weakly
to
LPS
(not
shown),
an
NF-κB
transcriptional response was induced by co-transfection with
the p65 subunit of NF-κB. All three of the CtBP constructs
suppressed NF-κB transcriptional activity, consistent with the
potent co-repressor activity of CtBP (Fig. 6b–d). Treatment with
2DG produced no further reduction in this already suppressed
NF-κB activity; however, treatment with CoCl2, which elevates
the NADH:NAD+ ratio, increased NF-κB activity in cells

Fig. 2 Relationships between glucose metabolism and cytosolic NADH:
NAD+ ratio. a Factors that reduce glucose flux through glycolysis, such as
reduced glucose availability or glycolytic inhibitors, reduce NADH levels
and thereby reduce NADH:NAD+ ratio, whereas factors that inhibit
oxidative metabolism, such as hypoxia and mitochondrial inhibitors, have
the opposite effect. Glutamine provides ketone bodies (α-ketoglutarate) to
fuel mitochondrial ATP production in the absence of glycolysis. Lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) maintains the lactate:pyruvate ratio in equilibrium
with the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio. b The lactate:pyruvate ratio provides
an index of the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio in cells treated with glycolytic
and mitochondrial inhibitors. 2DG, 1 mM 2-deoxyglucose; 0 Glu, glucose-

 expressing WT CtBP2, but not in cells expressing G189A mutant
CtBP2 (Fig. 6e). This pattern was also observed in primary
microglia:CoCl2 augmented LPS-induced iNOS expression in
microglia overexpressing wild-type CtBP, but not in microglia
overexpressing G189A CtBP2 (Fig. 6f).
Given that CtBP overexpression suppresses NF-κB transcrip-
tional activity (Fig. 6c, d) we also evaluated the possibility that
2DG effects on LPS-induced responses might be caused by
upregulated CtBP expression, independent of the CtBP responses
to cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio. However, measures of CtBP
mRNA levels in primary microglia showed that 2DG did not
increase expression of either CtBP1 or CtBP2, with or without
LPS co-treatment (Supplemantary Fig. 1a, b).
Peptide inhibition of CtBP dimerization. To further evaluate the
mechanism by which CtBP regulates inflammatory responses, we
generated a synthetic peptide that blocks CtBP dimeriziation.
Examination of the crystal structure of a rat CtBP dimer
complexed with NAD(H)37 suggested that a peptide near the center
of the dimerization region, if stably folded, could bind to the CtBP
monomer and interfere with dimer formation. This dimerization
region contains two alpha helical domains that are structurally
conserved in CtBP family members, and contains four residues that,
when
mutated,
prevent
dimerization
of
drosophila
CtBP22.
A peptide spanning this region, corresponding to amino acids
114−142 of the long form of mouse CtBP1 (Fig. 7a), and a control
peptide lacking any known effects on cell function were generated
and fused to N-terminal Tat sequences (CPC Scientific (Sunnyvale,
CA). The CtBP peptide sequence was GRKKRRQRRRC VEE-
TADSTLCHILNLYRRTTWLHQALREG (with the Tat sequence
underlined),
and
the
control
peptide
sequence
was
GRKKRRQRRRC CSFNSYELGSLCYGRKKRRQRR. To deter-
mine if the CtBP peptide could block CtBP dimerization in vitro, we
co-expressed CtBP1-HA and CtBP1-Flag tagged constructs in
COS7 cells and performed immunoprecipitation with antibody to
Flag. Very little HA-tagged CtBP was immunoprecipitated with
anti-Flag antibody in untreated control samples (Fig. 7b), suggesting
that the majority of the CtBP-tagged protein is monomeric.
In contrast, in vitro treatment of lysate with 10 mM lactate plus
10 µm NADH for 20 min prior to immunoprecipitation (to force an
increase in the NADH:NAD+ ratio in the lysates) greatly increased
the amount of CtBP1-HA associated with CtBP1-Flag. This
association was disrupted by co-incubation with 50 µm of the CtBP
peptide (Fig. 7b).
We next tested whether the CtBP peptide could inhibit
LPS-induced inflammatory gene expression, as observed in the
2DG—induced ketogenic state. Primary microglia were treated
with LPS, alone or in combination with 5 µm CtBP peptide or
control peptide. The CtBP peptide reduced LPS-induced iNOS,
IL-1b, and IL-6 transcript expression, while the control peptide
had no effect (Fig. 7c). We then evaluated whether the CtBP
peptide could block inflammatory gene expression in vivo. In
initial experiments, we treated mice intraperitoneally with 2DG
(100 mg/kg) 10 min prior to stereotactic injection of 8 µg LPS into
the left striatum. Three hours of post-surgery, brains were
removed and microglia were isolated from the striatum for gene

 expression studies. These studies confirmed that LPS robustly
induces iNOS expression in microglia in vivo, and that this effect
is attenuated by 2DG (Fig. 7d). We then co-injected LPS (8 µg)
along with the CtBP peptide or control peptide into the striatum
3 h prior to microglial isolation. The LPS-induced increase in
iNOS gene expression was reduced by the CtBP peptide, but not
by the control peptide. In contrast, LPS-induced expression of the
M2-type anti-inflammatory gene, Socs3 (Suppressor of cytokine
signaling 3)38, was unaffected by CtBP peptide, demonstrating
that the peptide does not exert a global or nonspecific effect on
transcription (Fig. 7e, f).
p300 binding to CtBP and pro-inflammatory gene promoters.
One way that CtBP regulates gene transcription is through
interactions with the histone acetyltransferase HDAC119. We
therefore performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
targeting the IL-6 promoter to evaluate the effects of ketogenic
state on HDAC1 binding and histone H3 acetylation. Both
HDAC1 binding and H3 acetylation were increased in cells
treated with LPS, but neither was reversed by 2DG (Fig. 8a).
A second way that CtBP regulates gene transcription is by
repressing the activity of p30020,
39, which acetylates and
thereby promotes the activity of transcription factors such as
the p65 subunit of NF-κB25. The ChIP studies showed that
LPS-induced p65 binding to the IL-6 promotor, and that this was
completely reversed in the presence of 2DG (Fig. 8a). This effect
of 2DG was accompanied by parallel changes in p65 acetylation
status, as assessed by western blots from cells treated with LPS
or LPS + 2DG (Fig. 8b). Additional ChIP studies showed that
LPS-induced p300 binding to the IL-6, IL-1b, and iNOS promoter
regions, and that 2DG markedly attenuated each of these effects
(Fig. 8c). These results parallel the effects of LPS and 2DG on
iNOS, IL-1b, and IL-6 mRNA and protein expression (Figs. 1, 4).
We then performed co-immunoprecipitation of p300 with CtBP
in cells transfected with either wild-type CtBP2 or G189A CtBP2
to confirm that p300 binding to CtBP is similarly sensitive to
NADH. 2DG—induced reductions in the cytosolic NADH:NAD+
ratio did not increase the binding of p300 to either wild-type
CtBP2 or G189A CtBP2, presumably because binding was already
saturated by CtBP overexpression; however, CoCl2—induced
elevations in the NADH:NAD+ ratio reduced the binding of p300
to wild-type CtBP, but not G189A CtBP2 (Fig. 8d, e).
Discussion
CtBP has previously been shown to mediate effects of cellular
metabolic state on transcriptional events contributing to cancer
and epilepsy27, 40. Our present findings demonstrate that CtBP
similarly couples metabolic state to the innate inflammatory
response. We show that the pro-inflammatory gene expression
and NF-κB transcriptional activity induced by LPS are coupled to
glucose metabolism by the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio, and that
this coupling is attenuated by CtBP downregulation, by forced
elevation of NADH, by transfection with an NADH—insensitive
CtBP, and by a synthetic peptide that blocks NADH-induced
CtBP dimerization. We additionally show that metabolic state
influences CtBP binding to the acetyltransferase p300, p300
binding at pro-inflammatory gene promoter sites, and acetylation
state of NF-κB. The observations suggest a mechanism by which
the liberation of CtBP from its dimerized form by lowered
cytosolic NADH levels can suppress pro-inflammatory gene
transcription.
The initial observation by Zhang et al.26 that NADH binding
promotes CtBP dimerization suggested that CtBP could regulate
transcription in response to metabolic changes. Subsequent
studies confirmed that CtBP mediates effects of 2-deoxyglucose,
hypoxia, pyruvate, and other metabolic influences on gene
expression27, 41. Since NAD+ and NADH recognize the same
binding site on CtBP, changes in the concentration of either
nucleotide could, in principle, regulate CtBP interactions with its
binding partners. However, the relative changes in NADH caused
by shifts in the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio are several hundred-
fold greater than the reciprocal changes in NAD+ because the
cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio is normally in the range of 1:70035.
The sensitivity of CtBP to changes in NADH thus makes it
particularly responsive to changes in energy metabolism42.
Inflammatory responses can also be modulated by NAD+—
dependent deacetylases of the sirtuin family, notably Sirt143, but
unlike CtBP sirtuins are not responsive to changes in NADH
concentrations, and it remains uncertain whether their activity is
significantly affected by the relatively small changes in NAD+
concentrations that result from changes in energy metabolism44.
CtBP1 and CtBP2 have nearly identical amino acid sequences
and share the same NAD(H) binding site. CtBP1 lacks a putative
nuclear localization signal, but may enter the nucleus as hetero-
dimer with CtBP2 or other proteins22, 45 and may also interact in
the extra-nuclear cytosol with binding partners such as p300 and
HDAC1. CtBP2−/− mice are nonviable, but CtBP1−/− mice are
viable and fertile. Mice with combinations of CtBP1 and CtBP2
mutant alleles exhibit gene dosage-sensitive defects in several
developmental processes17. Specific defects in immune function
were not reported in these mutants, but CtBP has elsewhere
been shown to modulate the role of estrogen receptors on
inflammatory responses mediated by the AP-1 transcription
factor, independent of metabolic changes46.

 transferases, E3 ligases, and the p300 acetyltransferase. We did
not find changes in histone acetylation or HDAC1 binding at pro-
inflammatory gene promoters in response to a ketogenic state,
but did find decreased binding of p300 and decreased acetylation
of p65, which is a substrate for p30025. Since p65 acetylation
increases NF-κB transcriptional activity, these findings identify a
mechanism by which metabolic effects on CtBP can modulate
gene transcription. However, both monomer and dimer forms of
CtBP can affect gene transcription21–24, and our findings do not
establish that p300/CtBP binding is essential for the observed
effects of CtBP on pro-inflammatory gene transcription. CtBP2
could alternatively directly associate with p65 and suppress its
acetylation by a mechanism independent of dimer/monomer
transition or p300 inhibition47. Recent studies have also identified
alternative ways that glucose metabolism can influence inflam-
matory responses, including effects on HDAC4 protein levels,
NLRP3 inflammasome formation, and the activation of RAGE
receptors48–50.
Cell cultures were used in our studies to facilitate manipulation
of CtBP expression and cellular cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratios.
A limitation cell cultures, and cell lines in particular, is a shift
from
respiratory
ATP
production
toward
more
glycolytic
ATP production (the Warburg effect51). Moreover, the glucose
concentration in standard culture media is saturating for
glucose uptake and metabolism. As a consequence, basal glyco-
lytic flux is typically much higher in culture preparations than
in vivo. This may explain why relatively larger shifts in the
cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio were observed with glycolytic
inhibition
than
with
respiratory
inhibitors.
However,
the
anti-inflammatory effects of 2DG in the cell culture preparations
were also observed in vivo, as initially reported several decades
ago6. Importantly, these results were also mimicked, both

 in vitro and in vivo, by the use of a novel synthetic peptide that
inhibits NADH-induced CtBP dimerization. This result agrees
with the prior observation that native CtBP1 requires NADH to
suppress p300 activity, whereas a mutant form of CtBP1 that
cannot dimerize suppresses p300 independent of NADH20 It may
be surprising that reduced CtBP expression did not itself lead to a
super-induction of iNOS and related genes, given co-repressor
actions of CtBP. However, a reduction in total CtBP does not
necessarily produce a comparable reduction in nuclear mono-
meric CtBP.
Taken together, our findings indicate that metabolic influences
that alter the cytosolic NADH:NAD+ ratio regulate NF-κB
transcriptional activity through an NADH-dependent effect on
CtBP dimerization. Conditions that reduce glycolytic flux, such
as ketogenic diet and caloric restriction, can thereby suppress
NF-κB activity, while conditions that increase glycolytic flux may

suppressive effects of ketogenic diet and caloric restriction on
brain inflammation after brain injury. By extension, these inter-
actions may also contribute to the pro-inflammatory states
associated with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome15, 52, 53.

 Stereotaxic LPS injections were performed in adult male C57BL/6 J mice that
were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane. The left striatum (A 1.3, ML 1.9, DV 3.5 mm
from Bregma and the cortical surface) was injected with 8 µg LPS and 5 pmole CtBP
peptide or control peptide in a volume of 5 µl sterile saline over 25 min (0.2 µl/min).
Three hours later the mice were transcardially perfused with saline to remove
circulating macrophages. After perfusion, brains were quickly removed and the left
anterior quadrant containing the infusion site (approximately 100 mg tissue) was
dissected and placed in ice-cold Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) without Ca2+
and Mg2+. Tissue was briefly minced with a sterile razor blade and cells were
dissociated using Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P) and Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi
Biotec, San Diego, CA). Microglia were isolated using CD11b MicroBeads (Miltenyi
Biotec). Accuracy of cell separation was validated by expression profiling of
cellular fractions using quantitative PCR primers specific to microglia (Iba1 forward:
5′-GAAGCGAATGCTGGAGAAAC, reverse: 5′-GACCAGTTGGCCTCTTGTGT),
neurons (NeuN forward: 5′-GGAACAGTCTATGGGCCTGA, reverse:
5′-ACAAGAGAGTGGTGGGAACG) and astrocytes (GFAP forward:
5′-AGAAAGGTTGAATCGCTGGG, reverse: 5′-CGGCGATAGTCGTTAGCTTC)
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Hippocampal organotypic slice cultures. Slice cultures were prepared as
described58, with minor modifications. Brains were removed from 4-day-old male
mice C57BL/6 mice, and 350 µm sagittal sections were prepared with a vibratome
in ice-cold dissecting media. The hippocampi were placed on Millicell inserts in 6
well culture plates, and maintained for 2 weeks at 37 ˚C in 5% CO2/ 95% air
incubator. Experiments were initiated by adding 10 μg/ml LPS ± 1 mM 2DG. After
24 h the slices were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Slices were immunostained using
rabbit polyclonal antibody to Iba1 (Wako #019-19,741; 1:200 dilution) and rabbit
polyclonal antibody to iNOS (Millipore, # 06-573; 1:250 dilution).
Cell cultures. Mouse primary microglia cells were isolated and cultured as
described56 and used after 10 days in vitro. Cell lines were seeded at a density of
1 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates 1 day prior to the experiments. For protein
expression and luciferase assays, MEF cells, RAW264.7 cells and HEK293 cells were
seeded in 12-well or 24-well plates overnight, and transfected with plasmids using
Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) when they reached 80% confluence. A stable
CtBP1/2 knockdown cell line was generated from RAW264.7 cells by incubating
the cells with CtBP1/2 shRNA lentiviral stocks for 3 h. Puromycin was added after
48 h, and infected cells were selected over 10 passages. Stable clones were pooled for
propagation and experiments.
Studies were initiated by washing cells into serum-free Dulbecco’s minimal
essential medium containing 6 mM glutamine and 2 mM glucose (or no glucose,
where indicated). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lactate, and metabolic inhibitors were
added to this medium from concentrated stocks that were pre-adjusted to pH 7.4,
and the cultures were replaced in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. The final LPS
concentration was 10 ng/ml in the cell cultures. All experiments were repeated at
least three times, using triplicate wells in each experiment.
ATP measurements. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline
and extracted with ice-cold 0.5% trichloroacetic acid. The cell lysate pH was
adjusted to 7.8 with 1 M Tris-base. ATP concentration was determined by a
luciferase-linked method (Promega Enlighten ATP kit) using ATP standards.
Values were normalized to protein concentrations as determined by the Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad) in sister culture wells.
Lactate and pyruvate assays. RAW264.7 cells were rinsed with ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 0.2 N NaOH, and aliquots were taken for
protein assay. Lactate and pyruvate were measured in pH-neutralized lysates by
enzyme-linked assays as described12 using standards treated identically.
NADH imaging. Real-time changes in cellular (cytoplasmic) NADH content were
estimated by measuring endogenous NADH fluorescence with 360 nm excitation
and > 410 nm emission59. Fluorescence images were acquired at 1 min intervals
after 5 min of baseline recording. Regions of interest were selected from the nucleus
to eliminate signal from mitochondria, and cytochalasin D (1 µm) was included to
prevent cell movement. Images acquired from each cell were used to calculate
change in fluorescence intensity / average of pre-treatment fluorescence intensity
(ΔF/Fo). In a subset of experiments cells were pre-incubated with 200 nm
Mitotracker Red-FM (Molecular Probes) to verify that the NADH fluorescence
measurements were not contaminated by mitochondrial NADH fluorescence.
Mitochondrial and NADH signals were imaged by interleaving NADH
fluorescence excitation and Mitotraker (excitation 550 nm; emission > 610 nm).
Nitric oxide measurements. Production of nitric oxide was assessed by analyzing
nitrite concentrations in the culture medium collected after 24 h incubation under
the designated conditions. Aliquots of culture medium or nitrite standards
prepared in culture medium were mixed with equal volumes of Griess reagent
and light absorbance was measured at 540 nm56. Values were normalized to the
protein content of each culture well.
Luciferase reporter gene assays. Cells were transfected with 300 ng of 5xNF-κB
or iNOS firefly luciferase constructs using Lipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies),
and co-transfected with 100 ng of GL3-Renilla luciferase construct (Promega) as an
internal control of transfection efficiency. In some experiments cells were also
transfected with a CtBP constructs (200 ng) or CtBP empty control vector. Renilla
luciferase and firefly luciferase activity were measured in cell lysates using a
dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) on a Modulus Microplate Reader (Turner
Biosystems). Reporter luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase
activity in each assay.
Microarray and differential expression analysis. Cells were collected after 24 h
incubation under the designated conditions. RNA was extracted and arrayed in
triplicates using Mouse OneArray chip (Phalanx Biotech). Data analysis was
performed using Bioconductor packages in R (www.bioconductor.org). Raw reads
from microarrays were first normalized across the samples using the ‘vsn’ package
from Bioconductor60. The normalized expression levels of the samples (with
technical and experimental duplicates) were then fitted with a mixed linear model
using the ‘limma’ package from Bioconductor61. Differential expression between
pairs of treatment factors were also calculated using the ‘limma’ package, and the
resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple tests using the Benjamin-Hochberg
procedure. A Venn diagram was also generated to visualize the overlap of
differentially expressed genes between pairs of factors among three factors, using
R codes adapted from the ‘limma’ package. Shared transcription factor binding
sites were identified by blast differentially expressed genes in the oPOSSUM server
(http://opossum.cisreg.ca/oPOSSUM3/) with a filter setting of Z-score above 15.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis. RNA was extracted from freshly harvested
cells (Qiagen), treated with DNAse I (Promega) and first-strand cDNA was
synthesized from 2 μg total RNA with Oligo (dT) primers (Life Technologies).
Real-time PCR with SYBR green detection (Applied Biosystems) was performed as
described previously62 using an ABI 7900HT FAST Real-Time PCR System.
Dilution series and standard curves of β-actin were amplified on each plate for all
experiments. Transcript levels of all genes from each sample were normalized to its
ß-Actin mRNA level using the 2−ΔΔCT method62.
Co-immunoprecipitation and western blots. Cells were lysed with M-PER
reagent (Pierce) supplemented with benzonase nuclease (Novagen) and protease
inhibitors (Roche). Soluble lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and the
supernatant was incubated with anti-Flag M2 agarose (Sigma) overnight. The M2
agarose was washed five times with 0.25% Triton X-100 / phosphate-buffered saline
and three times with 0.5% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline. Bound protein
was eluted using 1X Sample Loading Buffer (Invitrogen) and heated to 100 °C for
5 min. Lysate and eluate were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to
PVDF membranes (Millipore)62. The blots were probed with mouse polyclonal anti
iNOS (Upstate, #06-573; 1:1000), rabbit polyclonal anti ß-actin (Sigma-Aldrich,
#A2066; 1:1000), and mouse monoclonal anti-CtBP (AbNova, # H1487-MO1,
1:1000).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for
10 min at 37 °C and rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supple-
mented with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors (Roche). Cells
were then lysed, sonicated on ice, and centrifuged. Aliquots of the supernatants
were heated to reverse crosslinks and recover genomic DNA for an input control.
A ChIP assay kit (Millipore) was used with mouse antibody to CtBP (AbNova, #
H1487-MO1, 1:250 dilution) and rabbit antibodies to p300, HDAC1, and p65
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-585, sc-7872, sc-372) or acetyl H3 (Cell Signaling,
#8173), each at 1:250 dilutions, and with mouse and rabbit IgG controls (Cell
Signaling). Precipitated material was eluted by two 15 min incubations at room
temperature with 250 μl of 1% SDS / 0.1 M NaHCO3. Chromatin was crosslink-
reversed and submitted to RNAse and proteinase K digestion. DNA was extracted
by phenol-chloroform and the DNA from both the ChIP and the input controls
were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Primers targeting the iNOS,
Il-1b, and Il6 promoter regions were as published63, 64.
Peptide design and synthesis. The crystal structure of a rat CtBP dimer
complexed with NAD(H) (PDB 1HKU)37 using Accelrys DS Viewer
1.7 suggested that a peptide near the center of the dimerization region, if
stably folded, might interfere with dimer formation. This dimerization region
contains two alpha helical domains that are structurally conserved in CtBP
family members and also contains residues that, when mutated, prevent
dimerization of drosophila CtBP22. A corresponding CtBP peptide along with
a control peptide lacking any known cell function were generated and fused to
an N-terminal Tat sequence by CPC Scientific (Sunnyvale, CA). The CtBP peptide
sequence was GRKKRRQRRRC VEETADSTLCHILNLYRRTTWLHQALREG
(with the Tat sequence underlined), and the control peptide sequence was
GRKKRRQRRRC CSFNSYELGSLCYGRKKRRQRR.

 CtBP dimerization assay. CtBP1-HA and CtBP1-Flag expression constructs were
generated by PCR amplification of full length CtBP1 coding sequence from
mouse brain-derived cDNA, followed by cloning in-frame into pSelect-CHA-zeo
(Invivogen, San Diego, CA) and pCMV-(DYKDDDDK)-C (Clontech, Mountain
View, CA) vectors, respectively. Clone identity and integrity were verified by
sequence analysis. COS7 cells were grown to 75% confluence in 6-well plates in
Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium containing fetal bovine serum and 230 µm
sodium pyruvate. Five micrograms of each plasmid per plate was transfected
using Lipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). 24 h post
transfection, cells were washed once in 1X PBS and lysed in NP-40 buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA)
containing Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).
Lysates were cleared of cellular debris by brief centrifugation and concentration
determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Forty
micrograms of protein from each sample lysate was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min
either with or without the addition of 50 µm CtBP peptide. In some studies
incubation solution also contained 10 mM sodium lactate and 10 µm NADH to
promote CtBP dimerization. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed by
overnight incubation of samples with 2 µg mouse monoclonal ANTI-FLAG M2
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, # F3165), 3 h incubation with 40 µl prewashed protein
A/G-Sepharose beads (Biovision Inc., Milpitas, CA) and serially washed with
NP-40 buffer per manufacturer’s instructions. Bound protein was eluted from
Sepharose beads by addition of NuPAGE LDS Sample buffer (Life Technologies,
Inc.) and analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis using polyclonal
rabbit anti-HA antibody (Thermo Scientific, # PA1-985, 1:500 dilution).
Statistical analyses. In all cell culture or slice culture studies the ‘n’ values denote
the number of independent experiments, each using neurons prepared from
different mice. Each independent experiment contained triplicate culture wells.
Data other than the microarray results are expressed as means ± SEM and assessed
using one-way ANOVA followed by either the Tukey–Kramer test where multiple
groups are compared against one another, or Dunnett’s test where multiple groups
are compared against a common control group. All data analyses were performed
while blinded to the treatment conditions.
