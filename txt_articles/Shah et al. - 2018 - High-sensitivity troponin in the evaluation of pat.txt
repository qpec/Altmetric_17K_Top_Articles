Summary
Background High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays permit use of lower thresholds for the diagnosis of myocardial 
infarction, but whether this improves clinical outcomes is unknown. We aimed to determine whether the introduction 
of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay with a sex-specific 99th centile diagnostic threshold would 
reduce subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. 
Methods In this stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled trial across ten secondary or tertiary care hospitals in 
Scotland, we evaluated the implementation of an hs-cTnI assay in consecutive patients who had been admitted to the 
hospitals’ emergency departments with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Patients were eligible for inclusion if 
they presented with suspected acute coronary syndrome and had paired cardiac troponin measurements from the 
standard care and trial assays. During a validation phase of 6–12 months, results from the hs-cTnI assay were 
concealed from the attending clinician, and a contemporary cardiac troponin I (cTnI) assay was used to guide care. 
Hospitals were randomly allocated to early (n=5 hospitals) or late (n=5 hospitals) implementation, in which the high-
sensitivity assay and sex-specific 99th centile diagnostic threshold was introduced immediately after the 6-month 
validation phase or was deferred for a further 6 months. Patients reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay were defined 
as those with an increased hs-cTnI concentration in whom cTnI concentrations were below the diagnostic threshold 
on the contemporary assay. The primary outcome was subsequent myocardial infarction or death from cardiovascular 
causes at 1 year after initial presentation. Outcomes were compared in patients reclassified by the high-sensitivity 
assay before and after its implementation by use of an adjusted generalised linear mixed model. This trial is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01852123.
Findings Between June 10, 2013, and March 3, 2016, we enrolled 48 282 consecutive patients (61 [SD 17] years, 
47% women) of whom 10 360 (21%) patients had cTnI concentrations greater than those of the 99th centile of the 
normal range of values, who were identified by the contemporary assay or the high-sensitivity assay. The high-
sensitivity assay reclassified 1771 (17%) of 10 360 patients with myocardial injury or infarction who were not identified 
by the contemporary assay. In those reclassified, subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death within 
1 year occurred in 105 (15%) of 720 patients in the validation phase and 131 (12%) of 1051 patients in the implementation 
phase (adjusted odds ratio for implementation vs validation phase 1·10, 95% CI 0·75 to 1·61; p=0·620).
Interpretation Use of a high-sensitivity assay prompted reclassification of 1771 (17%) of 10 360 patients with myocardial 
injury or infarction, but was not associated with a lower subsequent incidence of myocardial infarction or 
cardiovascular death at 1 year. Our findings question whether the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction 
should be based on the 99th centile derived from a normal reference population.

Introduction
Myocardial infarction is defined by the clinical history, 
electrocardiogram, and an increase or decrease in cardiac 
troponin concentration (as evidence of myocardial 
necrosis).1 Improvements in assay sensitivity now permit 
the quantification of very low concentrations of troponin 
with high precision, which allows the use of lower 
diagnostic thresholds.2 The Universal Definition of 
Myocardial Infarction1 recommends that an increase in 
troponin above the 99th centile of a normal reference 
population should be used as the threshold for diagnosis 
of myocardial infarction. Furthermore, it recognises that

troponin concentrations differ in men and women,3,4 and 
suggests sex-specific diagnostic thresholds be applied 
when using high-sensitivity assays.
The use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays and 
lowering the diagnostic threshold to the 99th centile 
remains a contentious issue in clinical practice;5 there-
fore, despite guideline recommendations,1 few institutions 
worldwide have adopted high-sensitivity assays.6,7 If 
increased sensitivity does not affect the specificity of 
testing for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, then 
intro 
ducing high-sensitivity assays will improve patient 
outcomes through better targeting of therapies for 
coronary heart disease. However, if the increase in 
sensitivity leads to poor specificity, then patients could 
be misdiagnosed, given inappropriate medications, and 
potentially have adverse outcomes. We aimed to determine 
whether the introduction of a high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay with a sex-specific 99th centile 
diagnostic threshold would reduce subsequent myocardial 
infarction or cardiovascular death within 1 year in patients 
with suspected acute coronary syndrome who would 
previously have been classified as not having had a 
myocardial injury and were reclassified following use of 
the high-sensitivity assay.
Methods
Study design and participants
The High-Sensitivity Troponin in the Evaluation of patients 
with suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome (High-STEACS) 
trial is a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled 
trial that aimed to prospectively evaluate the implementation 
of an hs-cTnI assay in consecutive patients with suspected 
acute coronary syndrome in ten secondary and tertiary 
care hospitals in Scotland. Sites were eligible if they had 
the capacity to measure the trial assay and if they returned 
data to the national hospital admissions database.8 All 
patients attending the Emergency Department were 
screened for suspected acute coronary syndrome by the 
attending clinician; at the same time, troponin was 
requested with an electronic form integrated into the 
clinical care pathway. Patients were eligible for inclusion if 
they presented with suspected acute coronary syndrome 
and had paired cardiac troponin measurements from the 
standard care and trial assays. Patients were excluded if 
they had been admitted previously during the trial period 
or were not resident in Scotland.
The study was approved by the Scotland A Research 
Ethics Committee, the Public Benefit and Privacy Panel 
for Health and Social Care, and by each National Health 
Service (NHS) Health Board. The conduct of the trial was 
periodically reviewed by an independent data monitoring 
committee. All data were collected prospectively from the 
electronic patient record, de-identified and linked within 
secure NHS Safe Havens (figure 1).
Randomisation and masking
In this trial, the hospital site was the unit of randomisation. 
Cluster randomisation was necessary to avoid the risk of 
clinical error due to reporting of different troponin assays 
and thresholds simultaneously. All sites reported cardiac 
troponin concentration by use of a contemporary troponin 
assay and an existing diagnostic threshold in a validation 
phase of at least 6 months. Sites were paired based on 
expected number of patients presenting with suspected 
acute coronary syndrome before they were randomly 
allocated to early or late implement 
ation of the high-
sensitivity assay (with sex-specific thresholds) for the 
diagnosis of myocardial infarction (figure 1; appendix).

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for reports published in English between 
Jan 1, 2010, and July 18, 2018, with the search terms “cardiac 
troponin”, “myocardial infarction”, “acute coronary syndrome”, 
and “randomised controlled trials”. Although no randomised 
controlled trials have evaluated the effects of a high-sensitivity 
cardiac troponin assay on cardiovascular outcomes, a previous 
study showed that lowering the diagnostic threshold with a 
contemporary troponin assay was associated with a reduction 
in myocardial infarction or death in those reclassified as having 
had a myocardial infarction. Further, registry studies have 
shown a reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction but no 
difference in all-cause mortality following the introduction of a 
high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assay.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial to 
evaluate the effects of implementing a high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin I assay in patients with suspected acute coronary 
syndrome. We show that use of the high-sensitivity assay 
reclassified one in six patients with myocardial injury, but only 
a third of these patients had a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial 
infarction, and the incidence of subsequent myocardial 
infarction or cardiovascular death at 1 year was unchanged.
Implications of all the available evidence
Implementation of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assay 
and use of the 99th centile as the diagnostic threshold 
identifies more patients with myocardial injury than type 1 
myocardial infarction and does not lead to a reduction in 
subsequent cardiac events. This finding raises the question of 
whether clinical decisions should be based on a 99th centile 
threshold derived from a reference population or on an 
approach that acknowledges the continuum of disease and 
clinical presentation and optimises diagnostic accuracy. 
Finally, a high-sensitivity assay can identify low-risk 
populations, leading to reductions in the overall duration of 
hospital stay.

Allocation was masked from sites before their inclusion 
in the trial and allocation was masked from individual 
participants throughout.
Procedures
Cardiac troponin testing was done when patients pre-
sented at the hospital and was repeated 6 or 12 hours 
after the onset of symptoms, at the discretion of the 
attending physician and in accordance with national and 
international guidelines.9,10 Throughout the trial period, 
contemporary and high-sensitivity troponin assays were 
run simultaneously in plasma that had been taken but 
was surplus to clinical requirements. Attending clinicians 
were masked to the results of the high-sensitivity assay

during the validation phase and the contemporary assay 
during the implementation phase.
In the validation phase, a contemporary cardiac 
troponin I (cTnI) assay (Abbott Laboratories; Abbott Park, 
IL, USA) was used to guide clinical decisions. The inter-
assay coefficient of variation was determined at each site 
and was less than 10% at 40 ng/L (seven sites) and 
50 ng/L (three sites). Only cTnI concentrations above 
these diag 
nostic thresholds were reported.11 During the 
imple 
mentation phase, an hs-cTnI assay (ARCHITECTSTAT 
high-sensitive troponin I assay; Abbott Laboratories) was 
used to guide clinical decisions. This assay has an 
interassay coefficient of variation of less than 10% at 
4·7 ng/L,12 and a 99th centile upper reference limit of 
34 ng/L in men and 16 ng/L in women.3 To support 
implementa 
tion, we provided written educational 
material and pre 
sentations at each site and training 
for clinical and laboratory staff, and we updated the 
electronic patient record to highlight the change in assay 
and diagnostic thresholds.
We collected clinical information from a standardised 
electronic patient record (TrakCare; InterSystems 
Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA). All patients with 
hs-cTnI concentrations above the 99th centile were 
assessed in accordance with the Universal Definition 
of Myocardial Infarction,1 as previously described.13,14 
Two physicians who were masked to the study phase 
independently reviewed all clinical information, and 
discordant diagnoses were resolved by a third reviewer. 
Type 1 myocardial infarction was defined as myocardial 
necrosis 
(any 
hs-cTnI 
con 
centration 
above 
the 
99th centile with an increase or decrease in hs-cTnI 
concentration, where serial testing was done) in the 
context of a presentation with suspected acute coronary 
syndrome, with symptoms or signs of myocardial 
ischaemia on an electrocardiogram. Symptoms or 
signs of myocardial ischaemia due to increased oxygen 
demand or decreased oxygen supply (for example, 
tachy 
arrhythmia, hypotension, or anaemia) secondary 
to an alternative pathology and myocardial necrosis 
were defined as type 2 myocardial infarction. Type 4a 
myo 
cardial infarction was defined in patients with 
symptoms or signs of myocardial ischaemia following 
percutaneous coronary intervention, where hs-cTnI 
concentrations were 5 times greater than the 99th cen 
-
tile, or when concen 
trations had increased further if 
they were increased before the procedure. Type 4b 
myocardial infarction was defined as myocardial 
ischaemia and myocardial necrosis that was associated 
with stent thrombosis, docum 
ented at angiography. 
Myo 
cardial injury was defined as hs-cTnI concentrations 
greater than the 99th centile of normal reference values 
in the absence of any clinical features of myocardial 
ischaemia.
 The study population was stratified by peak troponin 
concentration. Patients with hs-cTnI concentrations 
within the reference range (1–16 ng/L in women, 
1–34 ng/L in men) were classified as having no myocardial 
injury. Patients with myocardial injury identified by the 
contemporary assay were defined as those with any cTnI 
concentration greater the diagnostic threshold of this 
assay. Patients reclassified by the hs-cTnI assay were 
defined as those with an increased hs-cTnI concentration 
(>16 ng/L for women, >34 ng/L for men), in whom cTnI 
concentrations were below the diagnostic threshold on the 
contemporary assay.

Outcomes
We used regional and national registries to ensure 
complete follow-up for the trial population12–15 (figure 1; 
appendix). The prespecified primary outcome was sub-
sequent myocardial infarction (type 1 or type 4b) or 
cardiovascular death within 1 year following the initial 
presentation to hospital. Primary outcome events were 
adjudicated by investigators who were masked to troponin 
concentrations during the index (ie, initial) presentation 
and study phase. The secondary efficacy outcomes were 
duration of hospital stay, myocardial infarction (type 1 or 
type 4b), unplanned coronary revascularisation, all-cause 
death, death from cardio 
vascular causes (cardiac and 
non-cardiac), hospital admission for heart failure, and 
ischaemic stroke. Secondary safety outcomes were major 
haemorrhage, unplanned hospital admission, excluding 
acute coronary syndrome, and non-cardiovascular death.
Statistical analysis
We estimated that 6·4% of patients would be reclassified 
by the high-sensitivity assay3 and that the event rate for the 
primary outcome would be 13% in this group.11 Based on 
the planned inclusion of ten sites, power was 74–85% for 
an absolute risk reduction of 4·4%, if the proportion 
reclassified was between 6% and 9%, and the intra-cluster 
correlation coefficient was between 0·05 and 0·10 
(appendix). Outcomes were compared in patients who 
had been reclassified by the hs-cTnI assay before and after 
its implementation by use of a generalised linear mixed 
effects model; the effects of the intervention were 
presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. The model 
adjusted for site, season, and time of presentation from 
the start date of the trial. Hospital site was fitted as a 
random effect, and age, sex, and social deprivation were 
included as fixed patient-level co 
variates. In a sensitivity 
analysis, an additional random effect was included in the 
primary analysis model to test for site-by-intervention 
interaction. Outcome event times were summarised 
descriptively before and after implement 
ation of the high-
sensitivity assay by use of Kaplan-Meier survival curves, 
and differences between phases were tested with a 
log-rank test. Statistical analysis was done with SAS 
version 9.4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01852123.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of

the data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication. 
Results
Ten of the 23 secondary or tertiary care hospitals in 
Scotland were eligible and all of these ten hospitals 
participated (appendix). Between June 10, 2013, and 
March 3, 2016, 48 282 consecutive patients with suspected 
acute coronary syndrome (61 [SD 17] years, 47% women) 
met the trial inclusion criteria (appendix) and were 
included in the analysis of the primary outcome. The 
trial concluded on March 3, 2017, after a minimum 
follow-up period of 1 year. 18 978 (39%) patients were 
admitted during the validation phase and 29 304 (61%) 
patients were admitted during the implementation 
phase. 32 045 (66%) patients were admitted across 
sites assigned to the early implementation group and 
16 237 (34%) patients were admitted across sites assigned 
to the late implementation group. 
Baseline characteristics of the study population are 
summarised in table 1, stratified by phase and analysis 
population. The study population was stratified by peak 
troponin concentration. During the initial presenta-
tion to hospital, we identified 10 360 (21%) of these 
48 282 patients with hs-cTnI concentrations greater than 
the 99th centile of normal reference values. Of the 
10 360 patients with increased hs-cTnI concentrations, 
1771 (17%) patients were reclassified by the high-
sensitivity assay and 8589 (83%) patients were identified 
by the contemporary assay (table 1). Patients reclassified 
were older (75 [SD 14] years in the reclassified group vs 
70 [15] years in those identified by the contemporary 
assay) and twice as likely to be women (83% vs 41%) than 
those identified by the contemporary assay. Compared 
with patients identified by the contemporary assay, those 
reclassified were as likely to present with chest pain 
(67% in those reclassified vs 71% in those identified by 
the cTn I assay) and have a history of ischaemic heart

myocardial ischaemia on the electro

toms and comorbidities) were similar in each analysis 
population across both phases (appendix).
Patients were followed up for 1 year for all primary and 
secondary outcome measures. Within 1 year, 2586 (5%) of 
48 282 patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome 
had a subsequent myocardial infarction or death from 
cardiovascular causes (table 2). The primary outcome 
occurred in 1106 (6%) of 18 978 patients who presented 
during the validation phase and in 1480 (5%) of 
29 304 patients who presented during the imple 
mentation 
phase (adjusted OR for implementation vs validation 
phase 1·05, 95% CI 0·92–1·19; p=0·48). Patients with 
myocardial injury were more likely than those without to 
have a subsequent myocardial infarction or death from 
cardiovascular causes within 1 year (figure 2). In patients 
who were reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay, the 
primary outcome occurred in 105 (15%) of 720 patients 
during the validation phase and 131 (12%) of 1051 patients 
in the implementation phase (1·10, 0·75–1·61; p=0·620;

differences in any of the secondary efficacy and safety 
outcome measures between phases (table 2; figure 3).

in 9115 (88%) patients, the diagnosis was type 1 myocardial 
infarction in 5028 (55%) patients, type 2 myocardial in-
farction in 1260 (14%) patients, and myocardial injury 
in 2810 (31%) patients. Compared with patients identi-
fied by the contemporary assay, those reclassified by 
the high-sensitivity assay were less likely to have 
type 1 myocardial infarction (515 [33%] patients who had 
been reclassified vs 4513 [60%] patients who had been 
identified by the contemporary assay), and more likely to 
be classified as having myocardial injury (796 [51%] 
patients vs 2014 [27%] patients).
Management during the index presentation was com-
pared. Patients reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay 
were more likely to undergo coronary angiography in the 
implementation phase compared with the validation 
phase (11% in the implementation phase vs 4% in the 
validation phase), but percutaneous coronary intervention 
(5% vs 3%) did not differ (table 3). Similarly, there 
were more new prescriptions for add 
itional anti-platelet 
therapy (18% vs 9%) and other sec 
ondary prevention 
agents during the implementation phase than the 
validation phase. The duration of hospital stay was longer 
in the implementation phase than the validation phase in 
reclassified patients (median 51 h, IQR 20–134 in the 
implementation phase; vs 21 h, 4–101 in the validation 
phase), but was shorter in patients without myocardial 
injury (4 h, 3–20; vs 7 h, 3–24) and in the study population 
overall (8 h, 3–40; vs 11 h, 4–38; table 3).

48 282 consecutive patients with suspected acute 
coronary syndrome. Introduction of the high-sensitivity 
assay prompted reclassification of 1771 (17%) patients 
with myocardial injury; however, only a third of these 
patients had a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction 
and the incidence of subsequent myocardial infarction 
or death from cardiovascular causes within 1 year was 
not changed by introduction of this high-sensitivity 
assay. 
There are several strengths of our trial design.16 First, 
we enrolled consecutive patients in whom the attending 
clinician suspected acute coronary syndrome by 
embedding our screening tool into the electronic health-
care system. Because the intervention was implemented 
at hospital level, consent was not sought from individual 
patients. This study design also avoided selection bias 
and ensured that, unlike in most cardiovascular trials, 
our study population was representative, comprising 
low-risk and high-risk individuals, an equal proportion of 
men and women, patients who presented out-of-hours, 
and those who were unwell and unlikely to survive. 
Second, throughout the trial, contemporary and high-
sensitivity troponin assays were run simultaneously in 
plasma that was surplus to requirement, to accurately 
identify all patients reclassified by high-sensitivity testing 
during both phases of the trial. Third, we used established 
regional and national registries12,15 to track investigations, 
treatments, and outcomes in all patients through linkage 
of electronic health-care records ensuring 100% follow-
up in those patients who remained resident in Scotland. 
Finally, these linked datasets were used to assess all index 
and primary outcome events in accordance with the 
Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction.
We previously showed that lowering the diagnostic 
threshold with a contemporary troponin assay was 
associated with a reduction in myocardial infarction or 
death in those reclassified as having myocardial infarction.11 
Despite these improvements, several obser 
vational 
studies17–19 that evaluated high-sensitivity assays have 
suggested that myocardial infarction is under 
diagnosed 
with contemporary assays and that mis 
diagnosis is 
associated with excess mortality.20 In this context, we 
expected that the introduction of a high-sensitivity assay 
would improve outcomes. However, we observed no 
difference in the primary or secondary efficacy outcomes 
within 1 year in patients reclassified with the high-
sensitivity assay. This finding was despite the assay 
identifying a group with similar cardiovascular risk factors 
as those with more extensive myocardial injury, and 
despite 236 (13%) of 1771 patients having a subsequent 
myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death within 1 year.
Several observations could explain our findings. First, 
only a third of patients who were reclassified by the high-
sensitivity assay actually had a diagnosis of type 1 
myocardial infarction and would therefore benefit from 
evidence-based therapies. Second, although patients with 
myocardial injury or type 2 myocardial infarction are 
known to have poor outcomes,21–23 this population is very 
heterogeneous, and no evidence from randomised trials 
yet exists to guide treatment in these patients. Third, 
although new prescriptions for anti-platelet, statin, and 
beta-blocker therapies doubled and the frequency of 
coronary angiography tripled in the implementation 
phase, overall only 1 in 10 patients received an additional 
secondary preventive drug or underwent angiography. 
However, many patients reclassified by the high-
sensitivity assay were already known to have ischaemic 
heart disease and were receiving secondary prevention at 
the time of presentation, which might have attenuated 
the potential to improve outcomes. Finally, most patients 
reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay were women, 
because the sex-specific 99th centile is lower in women 
than men. Many studies3,24 have reported that women are 
less likely to receive investigations and treatments for 
coronary heart disease than men, and this could have 
further attenuated any benefit of implementing the high-
sensitivity assay.
Although the duration of stay doubled in those 
reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay, it was reduced 
by a third across the trial population. This reduction was 
because most patients did not have myocardial injury or 
infarction, and their duration of hospital stay halved. 
Importantly, implementation might have improved the 
treating clinician’s confidence that myocardial infarction 
had been ruled out, resulting in an earlier discharge; our 
findings of reduced hospital stay duration are consistent 
with a previous study.25 Emerging evidence suggests that 
very low hs-cTnI concentrations at presentation can 
identify half of all patients as low risk.12,26,27 Similar 
observations have been reported for cardiac troponin T,28,29 
and risk stratification thresholds below the 99th centile 
have been incorporated into early rule-out pathways.30–34 
The 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines35 
recommend the use of pathways that incorporate 
thresholds below the 99th centile and small changes in 
cardiac troponin to improve both the rule-in and rule-
out of myocardial infarction. Together, these approaches 
have the potential to improve the efficiency of health-care 
systems, but prospective randomised controlled trials are 
ongoing to determine the effectiveness and safety of 
these pathways and their impact on patient care (such as 
ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03005158 and Australian New 
Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12615001379505).
To our knowledge, our findings represent the first 
evidence from a randomised controlled trial that evaluates 
the recommendations of the Universal Definition of 
Myocardial Infarction. Despite consistently implement-
ing these guidelines across all sites, use of the hs-cTn I 
assay did not improve outcomes for patients. In contrast 
to earlier studies,11 in which improvements in assay 
performance were associated with benefits in reducing 
the diagnostic threshold from 200 ng/L to 50 ng/L, 
further reductions identified a heterogeneous group of 
patients. The recommendation that the 99th centile from 
 Articles
www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   September 15, 2018 
927
a healthy reference population be used to diagnose 
myocardial infarction is based on expert consensus 
and observational studies rather than evidence from 
randomised controlled trials. Registry studies36–38 suggest 
that the introduction of a high-sensitivity cardiac tro-
ponin T assay was associated with better risk strati 
fication 
of patients in the Emergency Department and more 
percutaneous coronary inter 
vention with lower rates 
of recurrent myocardial infarction, but these studies 
showed no difference in all-cause mortality. By contrast, 
we showed that implemen 
tation of a high-sensitivity 
assay did not improve clinical outcomes in our ran-
domised controlled trial despite accurately identifying 
the group of patients most likely to benefit. This finding 
raises the question of what is the optimal approach to 
diagnose myocardial infarction. Should clinical decisions 
be based on a statistical threshold derived from a 
reference population, or an approach that acknowledges 
the continuum of disease and optimises diagnostic 
accuracy?
There are some study limitations. This was a pragmatic 
trial, and therefore we had to accept some flexibility in 
the implementation phase to accommodate shared out-
of-hours laboratory services, shared elec 
tronic patient 
records, and site closures (appendix). The proportion of 
patients reclassified with the high-sensitivity assay was 
smaller than anticipated from our pilot study3 but, given 
the consistency of our findings across a range of 
endpoints, it is unlikely a larger trial would have yielded 
a different result. Hospitals that use lower contemporary 
assay thresholds would reclassify fewer patients when 
implementing a high-sensitivity assay, but the effect 
on subsequent myocardial infarction or death from 
cardiovascular causes would probably be similar. A 
previous study39 has suggested that higher diagnostic 
thresholds should be applied in patients with renal 
impairment, and we did not evaluate this approach in 
our trial. However, renal function was similar in patients 
with myocardial injury, whether reclassified by the high-
sensitivity assay or identified by the con 
temporary assay, 
suggesting that the prevalence of this comorbidity is not 
the primary explanation for our findings. Finally, further 
research is required to understand how the changing 
criteria for the classi 
fication of patients with myocardial 
injury and infarction will affect patient management and 
clinical outcomes.
In conclusion, we have shown that implementation 
of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay prompted 
reclassification of 1771 (17%) of 10 360 patients with 
myocardial injury; however, only a third of these patients 
had a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction, and 
the incidence of subsequent myocardial infarction or 
death from cardiovascular causes within 1 year was not 
affected by use of this assay.
