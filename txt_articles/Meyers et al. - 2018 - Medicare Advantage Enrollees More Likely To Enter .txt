Abstract
Unlike fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare, most Medicare Advantage (MA) plans have a preferred 
network of care providers that serve most of a plan’s enrollees. Little is known about how the 
quality of care MA enrollees receive differs from that of FFS Medicare enrollees. This article 
evaluates the differences in the quality of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) that Medicare 
Advantage and FFS beneficiaries entered in the period 2012–14. After we controlled for patients’ 
clinical, demographic, and residential neighborhood effects, we found that FFS Medicare patients 
have substantially higher probabilities of entering higher-quality SNFs (those rated four or five 
stars by Nursing Home Compare) and those with lower readmission rates, compared to MA 
enrollees. The difference between MA and FFS Medicare SNF selections was less for enrollees in 
higher-quality MA plans than those in lower-quality plans, but Medicare Advantage still guided 
patients to lower-quality facilities.
Each year Medicare beneficiaries can choose between two options for health coverage: 
traditional fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare or Medicare Advantage (MA). The latter is a form 
of managed care in which patients can choose to enroll in plans offered by private insurance 
companies. These plans are paid for on a capitated basis by the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid (CMS) and have greater flexibility in their offerings than FFS Medicare. Over the 
past decade the share of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage has steadily 
increased, reaching 31 percent in 2016.1

 While both Medicare Advantage and FFS Medicare cover the same services, most MA plans 
have a preferred network of care providers. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, 
and Modernization Act of 2003 permitted this practice because narrow provider networks 
may reduce the costs of delivering care. Several studies have studied narrow hospital 
networks and found that insurers have the potential to cut costs by limiting patients’ choice 
of providers.2–7 At the same time, MA plans must balance level of payment to providers and 
the quality of care delivered to patients, since higher-quality providers might not be willing 
to accept low payment rates.8 However, we have little understanding of the quality of care 
provided in MA plan networks and plans’ selection of hospitals and physician providers. A 
Massachusetts study found that plans with narrow networks excluded hospitals with higher 
star ratings more frequently than did plans with broader networks4 and often excluded other 
prestigious but expensive research institutions.9 Qualitatively, both insurance companies and 
hospital executives have described controlling costs by limiting access to certain facilities as 
a key strategy, particularly with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act.10 The paucity 
of research is mostly due to the unavailability of claims data for MA beneficiaries.
This study aims to evaluate the differential quality of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) 
selected by MA and FFS Medicare enrollees. A recent report by the Medicare Payment 
Advisory Commission documented that FFS payment rates for SNF services were about 23 
percent higher than MA payment rates.11 There is great variation in quality, payer mix, and 
cost factors across SNFs,12–16 and MA plans may therefore be contracting with lower-
quality SNF providers. Because SNF patients often have more severe care needs than other 
Medicare beneficiaries, it is particularly important to understand how SNF characteristics 
are associated with network formation and MA beneficiaries’ choice of SNFs. Research has 
found that beneficiaries move from Medicare Advantage to FFS in higher numbers after a 
SNF stay. This raises the question of how the quality of SNF care received by MA 
beneficiaries may differ from that received by FFS patients.17 It is possible to study these 
issues using the mandatory patient assessments that each SNF submits to CMS on all 
entering beneficiaries, including MA patients.
We examined data for all elderly Medicare beneficiaries newly admitted to SNFs between 
2012 and 2014 to assess the association of SNF quality ratings with selection decisions 
among FFS patients, compared to MA patients. Because we did not know specific 
contracting details for all MA plans, we assumed that any residual differences in the quality 
of SNFs chosen by MA and FFS beneficiaries, after other SNF characteristics were 
controlled for, were due to MA plans steering patients to preferred providers.
Study Data And Methods
DATA SOURCES
All data were for the period 2012–14. We drew enrollment and demographic information 
from the 100 percent Medicare Beneficiary Enrollment Summary File. We gathered 
information on beneficiaries’ SNF admission using a 100 percent Minimum Data Set (MDS) 
file (version 3). The MDS has been substantially validated as an accurate source of data on 
patients’ utilization; diagnoses; and physical, cognitive, and emotional functioning.18–21 We 
merged the MA enrollee data with Medicare’s Healthcare Effectiveness Data and

 Information Set (HEDIS) to identify each beneficiary’s MA plan, by plan contract with 
CMS. CMS requires all MA plans to report quality information for all of their covered 
beneficiaries in HEDIS. Then we merged our data set at the patient level with MDS claims 
data to create a data set of SNF admissions for both MA and FFS Medicare patients. We 
linked this data set to Medicare Advantage plan ratings by contract.22 These ratings range 
from one to five stars and are calculated monthly by CMS based on scores on thirty-two 
measures across five domains.23 We added several SNF-level characteristics from the Online 
Survey Certification and Reporting System (OSCAR), a data set assembled by CMS based 
on SNF inspection results that collected detailed information on SNF characteristics, and 
from its successor, the Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reports (CASPER). We 
also added facility rehospitalization rates and case-mix adjusters from publicly available 
SNF files from LTCfocus.24 Housed at Brown University, LTCfocus compiles nursing home 
information from OSCAR (CASPER), the MDS, Medicare claims, and the Area Health 
Resource File to create publicly available databases of nursing home characteristics over 
time.
STUDY COHORT
We included all Medicare enrollees ages sixty-five and older who were admitted to a SNF in 
2012–14 and who had not been admitted to one in the previous year. We excluded prior-year 
admissions because those admissions may have an overriding effect on the patients’ SNF 
selection decisions in the relevant year.
OUTCOMES OF INTEREST
Our outcomes of interest were Nursing Home Compare quality ratings (ranging from one to 
five stars) and adjusted rates of rehospitalization.24–25 While the measures used in the SNF 
star ratings have come under scrutiny in recent years,26–30 they still provide a useful 
summary of SNF quality, and are also correlated with SNF costs.31 We chose to use publicly 
available star ratings from Nursing Home Compare because these are the scores that 
Medicare enrollees would have access to when making their SNF selection.
We obtained data on adjusted thirty-day rehospitalization rates for each SNF from 
LTCfocus.org. (CMS did not make Nursing Home Compare readmission rates public until 
2016.) Research has found that using a SNF with historically lower rehospitalization rates 
reduces a patient’s likelihood of future rehospitalization.32 The adjusted rehospitalization 
rates are calculated as the observed rate of rehospitalization within thirty days at a given 
SNF divided by the expected number of rehospitalizations at that SNF, multiplied by a 
national average.32 The expected number of rehospitalizations is calculated by LTCfocus 
from a predictive model that includes thirty variables from the MDS to adjust for SNF 
characteristics and case-mix.24
EXPLANATORY VARIABLES
Our primary explanatory variable was MA or FFS enrollment status. A beneficiary was 
considered an MA enrollee if they were enrolled in an MA plan at the time of SNF 
admission. We stratified MA enrollment status by enrollees in higher-quality MA plans (four 
or more stars) and lower-quality MA plans (fewer than four stars).

 To ensure comparability between FFS and MA enrollees, we included covariates for age, 
sex, race, residential ZIP code, and Medicaid eligibility in the month of SNF admission from 
the enrollment file. We also included indicators of marital status and primary language from 
the MDS. Clinical control variables included activities of daily living,33 cognitive function,
34 and indicators of several diagnoses.
In our choice models we also included controls for SNF number of beds, shares of 
Medicare-paid, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid-paid patients; whether the SNF 
belonged to a chain; and the SNF occupancy rate, ownership status (nonprofit or public 
versus for profit), and distance from the beneficiary’s residence. Previous work has found 
distance to be the principal factor influencing choice of SNFs.35 We calculated the distance 
from the centroid of a beneficiary’s ZIP code to the SNF’s latitude and longitude using the 
haversine formula.36
STATISTICAL METHODS
We used a three-step analytic approach. First, we examined any evidence of differential 
selection of SNFs based upon geography alone. Next, in our primary analysis, we examined 
adjusted differences in the quality of patients’ chosen SNFs between Medicare enrollee 
categories (those in FFS Medicare and those in higher- or lower-quality MA plans). Finally, 
we used a choice model to assess whether the relationship between SNF characteristics and 
enrollees’ choice of facilities varied across the three enrollee categories.
To examine evidence of differential selection based on geography, we first examined at the 
ZIP code level the percentage of enrollees in FFS Medicare and higher- and lower-quality 
MA plans who went to a higher-quality SNF. We assumed that patients within the same ZIP 
code would have access to similar SNFs of similar quality. We arrayed these percentages by 
ZIP code–level MA penetration to see if SNF selection in ZIP codes with greater penetration 
differed from that in areas with less penetration.
In our primary analysis, we used linear regression to examine the effect of MA plan 
enrollment on patient selection of higher- and lower-quality SNFs by star rating and on SNF 
rehospitalization rate, controlling for beneficiary residential ZIP code (using fixed effects) 
and other patient characteristics. Using ZIP code fixed effects allowed us to look at the 
relationship between enrollment status and the star ratings of SNFs selected by beneficiaries 
apart from the influence of geography. Adjusting for patient characteristics allowed us to 
control for other factors that might have played a role in guiding a patient to a SNF.
To address the possibility of a simultaneous impact of SNF characteristics on a beneficiary’s 
SNF selection, and to determine what factors most influenced SNF selection, we estimated 
the star ratings of nursing homes selected by beneficiaries using a McFadden choice model,
37,38 which has been used for similar purposes in previous studies.12,13,35 From a given 
neighborhood (ZIP code), patients have a set of alternative SNFs (choice set) to choose 
from. In choosing a SNF, patients explicitly consider specific facility characteristics but also 
choose based on a general sense of the SNF, which may reflect other underlying 
characteristics.12,13,35 Patients’ caregivers or providers may also make these decisions, based 
on different characteristics. Our goal was to assess how the influence of SNF characteristics

 on this selection differed between MA and FFS Medicare enrollees. For example, if MA 
plans are preferentially contracting with lower-quality SNFs, given all other SNF 
characteristics, a higher-quality SNF will have a higher likelihood of admitting an FFS 
Medicare patient than an MA patient from same neighborhood.
Based on previous literature,12,13,35 we defined a choice set for each patient as all SNFs 
within twenty-two kilometers of the patient’s ZIP code, the fifteen closest SNFs, and any 
SNF that any other resident of that ZIP code selected. We fit a conditional logit regression 
model with each observation representing a patient choice. The outcome of interest was a 
binary variable with a value of 1 indicating the SNF that each patient actually chose and 0 
representing unselected choices. Using MA enrollment interaction terms, we estimated the 
differential effects of a SNF’s characteristics on the probability that a patient would select 
that SNF. We present these results as the marginal effect of a one-unit change in a 
characteristic on the probability of selecting a SNF.
In all of our models, we used inverse probability weighting derived from propensity scores 
to adjust for patient differences across FFS and MA plans. Details on the choice model and 
weighting methodologies are in the online appendix.39
Additional sensitivity analyses stratified results into subgroups for hip fracture patients, 
stroke patients, patients not dually eligible, higher and lower MA concentration in the 
residential ZIP code, and individual years. All analyses were conducted in Stata, version 14.
LIMITATIONS
Our study was subject to several limitations. First, if the overall star rating of a SNF on 
Nursing Home Compare is not actually linked to patient health outcomes, then the difference 
between Medicare Advantage and FFS Medicare in this study might not matter.
Second, we were unable to study detailed hospital claims for MA and FFS patients, so we 
could not check for differences in chronic conditions not measured in the MDS. However, as 
mentioned above, the MDS information is widely considered to be a valid measure of patient 
status.
Finally, we did not have information on actual contracts between MA plans and SNFs. 
Nonetheless, we could infer these relationships based on the SNFs that MA enrollees 
actually used.
Study Results
Exhibit 1 shows descriptive characteristics of the patient sample before weighting. After 
applying inverse probability weights, we found minimal differences among patients by 
enrollment type.
Exhibit 2 displays patterns of SNF selection arranged by MA penetration in patients’ ZIP 
code areas. We assumed that if there were no selection effect of Medicare Advantage, the 
three lines would be identical because patients in the same ZIP code would have access to

 SNFs of the same quality. Instead, we found that across most ZIP codes, FFS Medicare 
beneficiaries tended to use higher-quality SNFs.
Exhibit 3 presents the adjusted differences in the characteristics of the average SNF chosen 
by FFS and MA beneficiaries, controlling for patients’ characteristics and residential ZIP 
code fixed effects. Enrollees in both lower- and higher-quality MA plans were admitted to 
SNFs that had significantly lower overall star ratings and significantly higher adjusted 
rehospitalization rates. Notably, 4.22 percentage points fewer enrollees in lower-quality MA 
plans and 2.46 percentage points fewer enrollees in higher-quality MA plans who were 
admitted to a SNF during the study period went to a higher-quality SNF. Additionally, lower 
quality MA enrollees entered SNFs with significantly higher rehospitalization rates 
compared to FFS enrollees (0.13 percentage points higher for enrollees in lower-quality MA 
plans). MA enrollees also typically entered larger SNFs (6.5 and 7.7 more beds for lower- 
and higher-quality MA plans, respectively) and SNFs with more Medicaid-paid residents 
(3.0 percent and 2.5 percent greater shares of the SNF population for lower- and higher-
quality MA plans, respectively).
Exhibit 4 shows the marginal effect of a one-unit increase in each variable from the choice-
model analysis. A more detailed table of model coefficients is in the appendix.39 When we 
looked at quality indicators, we found that an increase of one star in the overall star rating of 
a given SNF increased the likelihood of an average FFS patient entering that SNFby 0.45 
percent, while the likelihood was increased by only 0.12 percent for patients in lower-quality 
MA plans and 0.11 percent for those in higher-quality plans. Similarly, a 1 percent increase 
in the adjusted rehospitalization rate decreased the likelihood of an average FFS patient to 
enter a given SNF by 1.63 percent but increased the likelihood of a patient in a lower-quality 
MA plan to enter that SNF by 2.38 percent. The results from the sensitivity analyses 
followed similar trends.
Discussion
Overall, we found that MA enrollees were differentially admitted to lower-quality SNFs than 
FFS patients were. This effect was robust to patients’ characteristics, patients’ residential 
ZIP codes, and the availability of facility choices for patients. Given the choices a given 
beneficiary makes when selecting a SNF, MA patients who are members of plans with either 
higher or lower star ratings are less sensitive to lower ratings and have a lower probability of 
going to a higher-quality facility, compared to FFS beneficiaries. We also found that among 
MA enrollees, the likelihood of selecting a poor-quality SNF (based on rehospitalization 
rates or star ratings) was greater for members of lower-quality MA plans relative to members 
of higher-quality plans. This may indicate that higher-quality MA plans guide patients 
toward relatively higher-quality SNFs than lower-quality MA plans do.
We found that the percentage of SNF residents who were dually eligible for Medicaid was 
not a significant predictor of SNF selection. While there may be some differences between 
network designs of MA contracts that serve primarily Medicaid patients, we were not able to 
detect a difference in our analysis.

 One other recent study that sought to evaluate the differential quality of SNFs selected by 
MA beneficiaries compared to FFS Medicare beneficiaries found little difference between 
the two groups.40 That study did not implement a choice model and therefore did not take 
into account all of the potential SNFs that a beneficiary had to choose from. Our analysis 
makes an important contribution in that it finds that, after adjustment for a patient’s distance 
to a SNF and for all of the available SNFs in a beneficiary’s area, MA enrollees were not as 
strongly influenced by SNF quality as FFS Medicare enrollees were.
We hypothesize that several factors may have led to these findings. FFS enrollees are not 
limited by network design when selecting a SNF. Given a wider range of choices, FFS 
enrollees (and agents involved in making a SNF selection on their behalf) may be influenced 
more by publicly available measures of quality, while MA enrollees might be limited by 
SNF networks established by MA plans. A recent qualitative study found that on hospital 
discharge, FFS patients were often given large lists of nearby facilities for making their 
selection, while MA enrollees were given a more limited list of facilities or were assigned a 
facility by a MA contract administrator.41 When guiding patients to a SNF, MA plans may 
be more influenced by past relationships with SNFs and physicians who practice there, and 
might not be as strongly influenced by quality when making network decisions.
It is challenging to quantify the overall effects on the health outcomes of MA beneficiaries 
going to SNFs with lower star ratings, compared to FFS beneficiaries. The measures used to 
calculate the overall star rating have been correlated with patient health outcomes,42–44 but 
no studies demonstrate what a one-star improvement in overall SNF star ratings leads to in 
patient outcomes. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that in a plan of 1,000 MA enrollees, 
up to 42 fewer patients would enter a higher-quality SNF than in a sample of 1,000 FFS 
patients. Given that about 20 percent of SNF residents are rehospitalized, the differences in 
rates for MA patients may be quite large.32
What can be done to ensure that MA plans contract with higher-quality SNFs? CMS’s 
rehospitalization measures for SNFs do not include MA patients in their calculations. 
Including MA patients in these measures could help better track any differences in outcomes 
between FFS and MA SNF patients. Also, CMS could require MA plans to be more 
transparent about the quality of SNFs in their networks when beneficiaries make their 
Medicare enrollment decisions. Additionally, including SNF outcomes in HEDIS star ratings 
might encourage MA plans to contract with higher-quality SNFs.
Conclusion
In summary, we found that Medicare Advantage enrollees appear more likely than FFS 
Medicare enrollees to enter lower-quality skilled nursing facilities. After we adjusted for 
distance and other choice factors, MA plan enrollees were less predisposed to choose higher-
quality SNFs, given the option. This indicates that MA plans may be influencing beneficiary 
decision making around nursing home selection. As MA plans continue to attract a larger 
share of the Medicare population relative to FFS Medicare, more information on the nursing 
home decisions made by MA plan enrollees and the outcomes of those choices are of vital 
policy importance.

SOURCE Authors’ analysis of data for 2012–14 from the Minimum Data Set, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set, and Nursing 
Home Compare. NOTES Baseline refers to the patient’s admission to the facility. FFS is fee-for-service Medicare. “MA lower quality” refers to 
MA plans given fewer than four stars by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and “MA higher quality” refers to the plans with four or 
five stars. Fully dual eligible patients typically have Medicaid pay for more Medicare services and also receive additional benefits not covered by 
Medicare. Partially dual eligible patients have some Medicare services paid for by Medicaid. The specifics of these arrangements vary state to state.

SOURCE Authors’ analysis of data for 2012–14 from the Minimum Data Set, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set, and Nursing 
Home Compare. NOTES “MA lower quality” and “MA higher quality” are explained in the notes to exhibit 1. The marginal effects show the 
change in probability of going to a given SNF if the relevant characteristic changes by one unit. For example, a 1 percent increase in a SNF’s 
adjusted rehospitalization rate decreases the likelihood that an average FFS Medicare patient would entering this SNF by 1.63 percent and increases 
the likelihood that a beneficiary in an MA low plan would enter it by 2.38 percent.
