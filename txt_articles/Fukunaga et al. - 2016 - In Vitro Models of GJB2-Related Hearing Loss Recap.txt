SUMMARY
Mutation of the Gap Junction Beta 2 gene (GJB2) encoding connexin 26 (CX26) is the most frequent cause of hereditary deafness world-
wide and accounts for up to 50% of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss cases in some populations. Therefore, cochlear CX26-gap
junction plaque (GJP)-forming cells such as cochlear supporting cells are thought to be the most important therapeutic target for the treat-
ment of hereditary deafness. The differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into cochlear CX26-GJP-forming cells has not been reported.
Here, we detail the development of a novel strategy to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells into functional CX26-GJP-forming cells
that exhibit spontaneous ATP- and hemichannel-mediated Ca2+ transients typical of the developing cochlea. Furthermore, these cells
from CX26-deficient mice recapitulated the drastic disruption of GJPs, the primary pathology of GJB2-related hearing loss. These
in vitro models should be useful for establishing inner-ear cell therapies and drug screening that target GJB2-related hearing loss.
INTRODUCTION
Hearing loss is the most common congenital sensory deficit
(Chan et al., 2010). Approximately 1 child in 1,000 is
affected with severe hearing loss at birth or during early
childhood, and this is defined as prelingual deafness (Mor-
ton, 1991; Petersen and Willems, 2006), with about half of
the cases attributable to genetic causes (Birkenhager et al.,
2010). There are more than 100 known forms of non-syn-
dromic deafness associated with identified genetic loci
(available at http://hereditaryhearingloss.org). Mutations
in the Gap Junction Beta 2 gene (GJB2), encoding connexin
26 (CX26), account for up to 50% of cases of non-syn-
dromic sensorineural hearing loss in some populations
(Morton and Nance, 2006). CX26 and CX30, which are
encoded by GJB6, co-assemble and participate in the forma-
tion of gap junctions between cells, and these connexins
are the two most abundantly expressed gap junction pro-
teins in the cochlea (Ahmad et al., 2003) (Figure S1 and
Movie S1).
Gap junctions facilitate the rapid removal of K+ from the
base of the cochlear hair cells, resulting in K+ recycling back
to the endolymph to maintain cochlear homeostasis (Kiku-
chi et al., 2000). CX26 is also involved in the develop-
mental organization of mammalian cochlea, for example,
tunnel of Corti, Nuel’s space, or spaces surrounding the
outer hair cells (Inoshita et al., 2008). CX26 and CX30
form heteromeric and heterotypic channels in most of
the cochlear gap junction plaques (GJPs) (Sun et al.,
2005) and in in vitro experiments (Yum et al., 2007).
Recently, expression of various transcription factors and
other proteins in human developmental fetal cochleae
from gestational weeks 9–22 were investigated using
immunohistochemistry (Locher et al., 2013, 2014), and it
has been found that the expression of CX26 and CX30 is
detectable in the outer sulcus cells at 18 weeks of gestation
(Locher et al., 2015).
In our recent study, it was shown that disruption of the
CX26 GJP is associated with the pathogenesis of GJB2-
related hearing loss and that the assembly of cochlear GJP
is dependent on CX26 (Kamiya et al., 2014). It was also re-
ported that cochlear gene transfer of GJB2 using an adeno-
associated virus significantly improved GJP formation and
auditory function (Iizuka et al., 2015). In our alternative
approach, a novel strategy was developed for inner-ear
cell therapy with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
(Kamiya et al., 2007).
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be produced
by the reprogramming of somatic cells, and are capable of
self-renewal and differentiation into various types of cells
such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Takahashi and Yama-
naka, 2006). Human cochlear cells are not readily acces-
sible for biopsy or direct drug administration because
of anatomical limitations. Therefore, ESCs/iPSCs are an
important tool for studying the molecular mechanisms
underlying inner-ear pathology as well as for generating
cells for replacement therapies. It was recently reported
that ESCs/iPSCs could be differentiated into inner-ear
progenitor cells by in vitro differentiation in adherent
monolayer culture and/or floating aggregation culture

 (Chen et al., 2012; Koehler and Hashino, 2014; Koehler
et al., 2013; Oshima et al., 2010). For recapitulation of neu-
ral tissue formation in a three-dimensional (3D) context,
floating aggregation culture is advantageous as it allows
more flexible adaptation of cell and tissue shapes compared
with 2D culture approaches (Eiraku and Sasai, 2012). Eiraku
et al. (2011) reported in vitro differentiation of ESCs into
cortical tissues when the cells were cultured as floating
aggregates in a serum-free medium, thereby establishing
the technique of serum-free floating culture of embryoid
body-like aggregates with quick re-aggregation (SFEBq cul-
ture). Koehler and colleagues reported differentiation of
ESCs into inner-ear hair cell-like cells using modified SFEBq
methods (Koehler and Hashino, 2014; Koehler et al., 2013).
For the establishment of strategies for inner-ear cell therapy
or the development of a disease model for GJB2-related
hearing loss, it is necessary to develop efficient differ-
entiation methods for inducing iPSCs to form cells with
CX26-containing GJPs. Although several studies have
demonstrated the induced differentiation of ESCs/iPSCs
into CX37/40/43/45-expressing cells (Mauritz et al., 2008;
Oyamada et al., 1996, 2013), no such protocol has been
reported for the differentiation of ESCs/iPSCs into CX26-
expressing cells.
Here we developed an efficient induction method for the
differentiation of mouse iPSCs into CX26-expressing cells
that, through subsequent adherent culture on cochlear
feeder cells, form CX26-GJPs typical of cochlear tissue.
RESULTS
Non-neural Ectoderm Induction in Three-
Dimensional Culture and Screening of High-CX26/
CX30 Aggregates
To develop disease model cells targeting GJB2-related
hearing loss, we induced CX26-expressing GJP-forming
cells from iPSCs using methods modified from previous
studies for the differentiation of inner-ear sensory epithelia
(Koehler and Hashino, 2014; Koehler et al., 2013). On day 7
of differentiation, aggregates showed similar morphology
composed of differentiated outer regions and undifferenti-
ated core regions (NANOG-GFP-positive cells, Figure S2) as
previously reported (Koehler and Hashino, 2014; Koehler
et al., 2013). In this study, we used the NANOG-GFP
reporter system to monitor the differentiation level.
NANOG is a transcription factor used to identify undif-
ferentiated cells. To screen the conditions to induce high
CX26/CX30 expression, we compared mRNA levels in
day-7 aggregates, including addition of bone morphoge-
netic protein 4 (BMP-4: BMP), inhibitor of activating recep-
tor-like kinase (ALK) receptors (SB-431542: SB), BMP/SB
(B/S), B/S + fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2: B/S + FGF),
B/S + inhibitor of ALK receptors (LDN-193189: B/S +
LDN), and B/S + FGF/LDN (B/S + F/L) (Figure 1A). CX26/
CX30 levels were significantly higher especially in BMP
and B/S. In contrast to B/S + F/L, a condition for hair cell dif-
ferentiation (Koehler and Hashino, 2014; Koehler et al.,
2013), BMP and B/S showed high mRNA levels both for
CX26 and CX30. Therefore, these two conditions were
selected for further isolation of CX26/CX30-expressing
cells. On days 7–11 of differentiation, BMP- and B/S-treated
aggregate were transferred to adherence culture (2D) with
trypsin-resistant inner-ear cells (TRIC), which we generated
as feeder cells (see Experimental Procedures) (Figure 1B).
CX26-GJP-Forming Cells in iPSC-Derived Aggregate
To analyze the localization of CX26 in iPSC aggregates, we
performed immunohistochemistry with day-7 aggregates
for which BMP and B/S showed the highest CX26/CX30
mRNA increases (Figure 1A). These aggregates formed a
distinct outer epithelium that enclosed small vesicles (Fig-
ures 1C and 1D). In a number of cells and particularly
within these vesicles, we distinguished large planar CX26-
containing GJPs, which, as we reported previously (Kamiya
et al., 2014), are characteristic of normal mouse cochlea
(Figures 1E–1H, S3D, and S3E). These cells, termed iPSC-
derived CX26-expressing GJP-forming cells (iCx26GJCs),
were disseminated throughout the small vesicles of the
aggregates. In contrast, undifferentiated (Nanog-positive)
iPSCs and TRIC feeder cells did not show immunolabeling
forCX26 (Figures S3A–S3C).Wealso used scanning electron
microscopy (EM) to examine the ultrastructure of cell
surfaces and borders of the small vesicles from BMP/
SB-treated aggregates. The surfaces of the small vesicles
showed distinct cell borders with associated microvilli
(Figures 1I–1K).
The iCx26GJC in 2D Cultures Formed CX26-
Containing GJPs as in the Developing Cochlea
The regions with iCx26GJC-containing small vesicles were
separated from day 7–11 aggregates and subcultured in
growth medium on TRIC feeder cells (Figure 1B). With
other feeder cells, for example, feeder cells from chicken
embryonic inner ear, or in non-feeder conditions on
non-coated or gelatin-coated dishes, the separated outer
epithelia and small vesicles did not proliferate and were
effectively dead. Although the iPSC aggregates that had
been subcultured on Matrigel-coated dishes proliferated,
CX26 was not observed by immunohistochemistry (data
not shown). We observed migration and proliferation of
subcultured small vesicles in 2D culture (Movie S2). The
subcultured small vesicles indeed colonized on TRIC feeder
cells, and the colonies contained iCx26GJC. In TRIC feeder
cells, iCx26GJCs proliferated significantly in adherent
culture conditions, and the CX26-containing GJPs were

in
the
cochlear supporting cells—specifically the outer- and in-
ner-sulcus cells (Figures 2A–2C). Although the proportion
of iCx26GJCs was only 1.8% ± 1.0% and 1.8% ± 1.0% in
the aggregates of BMP and B/S, respectively, they increased
to 32.2% ± 7.4% and 45.1% ± 9.6% in the 2D culture on
TRICfeedercells (Figure2I).LengthsofthelargestGJPsalong

 product frequently encountered in hereditary deafness,
co-localized with CX26 in most of the CX26-GJPs of the
differentiated cells (Figures 2K, 2L, and S4E–S4H). There-
fore, we inferred that CX26 and CX30 were the two main
components of these GJPs, as was the case in the cochlear
supporting cells—specifically the outer- and inner-sulcus
cells (Figures S4A–S4D). Furthermore, the iCx26GJCs

sion (Movie S2) had almost stopped (�days 14–16). We
observed both heterogeneous (Figures 2M and S5C–S5E)
and homogeneous (Figures S5F–S5I) P27Kip1-positive re-
gions including iCx26GJCs under the same condition.
Furthermore, SOX2, which is a transcript factor essential
for maintaining self-renewal, or pluripotency, of undiffer-
entiated or neural stem cells, was co-expressed in part of
cochlear supporting cells (Figures S6A–S6C). SOX2 signals
were partly observed in iCx26GJCs at day 15. We observed
both CX26+/SOX2+ cells and CX26+/SOX2� cells in the
same cell population (Figures 2N and S6D–S6I).
Ultrastructure of Gap Junctions and Cell Surfaces in
iPS-Derived Cells
We also analyzed the ultrastructure at the cell junction
sites in transmission electron micrographs (TEM) of
iPSC-derived aggregates. We found ultrastructure typical
of gap junctions, i.e., an intercellular layer between the
two distinct plasma membranes with a uniform inter-
membrane space of �2–4 nm (Figures 3A–3G). Figures
3C–3E show three distinct gap junctions around a tricel-
lular junction site among three iPS-derived cells. Such
characteristic
ultrastructures
of
gap
junctions
were
observed in two medium conditions, BMP (Figures 3A–
3E) and B/S (Figures 3F and 3G), but not in the others
(data not shown).

 We also examined the ultrastructure of the cell surfaces
and borders using scanning EM of 2D cultures at day 15
(Figures 3J and 3K). The cell surfaces of 2D culture showed
distinct, straight cell borders that formed hexagonal
or pentagonal shapes with microvilli distributed along
the borders as in normal cochlea (Figures 3H and 3I). In
contrast, TRIC feeder cells showed unstructured cell bor-
ders without microvilli as in conventional mesenchymal
cells (Figures 3L and 3M).
Functional Gap Junction Intercellular
Communication Networks in iCx26GJCs
To
investigate
whether
the
gap
junction
structures
observed in proliferated iCx26GJCs (Figures 2 and 3) were
functional in the formation of gap junction intercellular
communication (GJIC) networks, we performed scrape-
loading assays with Lucifer yellow (LY) (Yum et al., 2007)
on proliferated iCx26GJCs, with undifferentiated iPSCs
and TRIC feeder cell as controls. We used two different
iPSC strains and repeated the experiments at least three
times, with similar results. We quantified the extent of
dye transfer by measuring the distance from the scrape
line to the point where the fluorescence intensity dropped
to 1.53 the background fluorescence intensity. In the
iCx26GJC culture, we observed that LY diffused beyond
the wounded parental cells (Figures 4C and 4F). In contrast,
such extent of dye transfer was not observed in undifferen-
tiated iPSCs or cochlear feeder cells (Figures 4A, 4B, 4D, and
4E). As shown in the Figure 4J, quantitative distance of dye
transfer in iCx26GJCs (128.2 ± 4.24 mm) was significantly
longer (p < 0.01) than in undifferentiated iPSCs (14.8 ±
0.96 mm) or TRIC feeder cells (14.3 ± 0.74 mm).

 Propagation of Spontaneous Ca2+ Transients via Gap
Junctions in iCx26GJCs
To test whether iCx26GJCs propagate spontaneous Ca2+
transients via gap junctions in the developing auditory
system (Anselmi et al., 2008; Tritsch et al., 2007), we
performed Ca2+ imaging with the Ca2+ indicator fluo-4.
Spontaneous Ca2+ transients and their propagation were
detected in 2D cultures under the B/S condition (Figures
5A, 5B, and 5D–5F; Movies S4 and S6). The BMP condition
also showed the same Ca2+ transients and propagation
(data not shown), although the frequency was much less
than under the B/S condition.
Ca2+ Activity in iCx26GJCs Required ATP and
Hemichannels as in Developing Cochlea
To investigate whether this spontaneous Ca2+ activity
required ATP and hemichannels, as reported for this activ-
ity in developing cochlea (Schutz et al., 2010; Tritsch et al.,

 2007), we pharmacologically inhibited Ca2+ activity with
the p2x receptor antagonist PPADS (pyridoxal-phosphate-
6-azophenyl-20,4’-disulphonic acid) (Tritsch et al., 2007)
and connexin hemichannel blocker FFA (flufenamic
acid) (Anselmi et al., 2008; Bruzzone et al., 2005; Eskan-
dari et al., 2002; Gomes et al., 2005; Schutz et al., 2010;
Stout et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 1998). The spontaneous
Ca2+ signaling activity was clearly inhibited by PPADS
and FFA, and the activity was restored after removal of
the inhibitors (Figure 5C and Movie S5). In these analysis,
subset of the cells showed continuous slow oscillation
at random regions of the cell culture (Movie S5) and
some of them showed clear propagated waves as in devel-
oping cochlea (Figures 5A, 5B, and 5D–5F; Movies S4
and S6).
iCx26GJC Derived from CX26-Deficient Deafness
Mouse Recapitulated GJP Disruption as in the Cochlea
To investigate whether the induction strategy can apply to
disease model for CX26-associated deafness, we generated
an iPSC line from a CX26-deficient deafness mouse model,
CX26f/f P0-Cre (Kamiya et al., 2014), and tested the poten-
tial of this iPSC line to differentiate into GJP-forming cells.
WT-iCx26GJC showed large, planar GJPs (Figures 6G, 6I,
6K, and 6M) at the cell border that formed an orderly
pentagonal structure of hexagonal outlines, as in the wild-
type (WT) cochlea. In contrast, CX26f/f P0-Cre-iCx26GJC
showed drastically fragmented, small vesicle-like GJPs (Fig-
ures 6H, 6J, 6L, and 6N), as in the CX26f/f P0-Cre-cochlea
(Figures 6B, 6D, and 6F).
As shown in Figure 6P, GJP lengths in CX26f/f P0-Cre-
iCx26GJC (1.63 ± 0.07 mm) are significantly shorter (p <
0.01) than those of the WT (5.34 ± 0.28 mm), as in the co-
chlea (Figure 6O; WT, 4.72 ± 0.17 mm; CX26f/f P0-Cre,
1.76 ± 0.06 mm).
DISCUSSION
We report the development of a method to generate and
proliferate iCx26GJCs from mouse iPSCs for use as a disease
model and in inner-ear cell therapies targeting GJB2-related
hearing loss, the most frequent type of hereditary deafness
worldwide. Our induction method until day 7 was based on
Figure 6. The iCx26GJCs from CX26-Deficient Mouse Recapitulated the Drastic Disruption of GJPs as in Cochlea
(A–N) GJP formation in 16-week-old adult mouse cochleae (A–F) and iCx26GJC at day 15 (G–N). These samples were co-labeled with anti-
CX26 (red) and anti-CX30 (green) antibodies and were counterstained with DAPI (blue). WT-iCx26GJC showed large, planar GJPs (G, I, K,
and M) as WT mouse cochlea (A, C, and E). In contrast, CX26f/f P0-Cre-iCx26GJC showed drastically fragmented, small vesicle-like GJPs
(H, J, L, and N) as CX26f/f P0-Cre-mouse cochlea (B, D, and F). (I and J) Image of each boxed region in (G) and (H), respectively. (E, F, M,

 previous studies (Koehler and Hashino, 2014; Koehler
et al., 2013).
However, after the day-7 procedures, which screen for
a CX26/CX30 highly expressing condition, isolation of
CX26-positive small vesicles, and transferring CX26-posi-
tive small vesicles onto TRIC feeder cells, differ from previ-
ous studies (Koehler and Hashino, 2014; Koehler et al.,
2013).
Previous studies have targeted the generation of inner-
ear hair cell-like cells from ESCs/iPSCs (Chen et al., 2012;
Koehler and Hashino, 2014; Koehler et al., 2013; Oshima
et al., 2010). In contrast, we focused on CX26-GJP-forming
cells derived from iPSCs, as the cochlear supporting cell-
like cells. It has not been reported that ESCs/iPSCs differen-
tiated into the cells with clear CX26-GJPs characterized by
immunolabeling and gene expression for CX26/30, dye
transfer assay, and Ca2+ imaging.
In the modified SFEBq method, we confirmed that the
morphology and outer epithelium thickness of day 7–11
aggregates (Figure S2) were similar to those previously
reported (Koehler et al., 2013). As these thin outer epithelia
did not include the NANOG-GFP cells and were clearly
demarcated, they could be separated by dissection for
further adherent culture on cochlear feeder cells. In this
process (Figure 1B), the medium conditions and the timing
for optimal treatments were selected according to mRNA
expression and gap junction formation as determined in
subsequent experiments.
In the CX26 and CX30 mRNA expression analysis it
has been suggested that the BMP- or the B/S-treatment
condition is more suitable for differentiation into CX26-
and CX30-expressing cells compared with the B/S + F/L
treatment condition, which has been reported to differen-
tiate into sensory epithelium (Koehler and Hashino, 2014;
Koehler et al., 2013). It has also been suggested that the
differentiation into neural ectoderm by SFEBq culture
might be partially inhibited with respect to differentiation
into non-neural ectoderm (Koehler and Hashino, 2014;
Koehler et al., 2013), and the CX26/CX30 expression levels
were increased by BMP supplementation with some regula-
tion by additional supplements such as the transforming
growth factor b (TGF-b) inhibitor, SB-431542 (Figure 1A).
BMP signaling has been reported to be critical for induc-
tion of the non-neural ectoderm from the definitive ecto-
derm epithelium induced by SFEBq method (Eiraku and
Sasai, 2012). TGF-b inhibitor (SB-431542) suppressed
the undesirable induction of mesoderm induced by BMP
signaling (Koehler and Hashino, 2014; Koehler et al.,
2013).
The use of cochlear feeder cells was critical to the pro-
liferation of the iCx26GJCs (Figure 2I) and the increase in
CX26 plaque length (Figure 2J) in the dissected small
vesicle of the aggregates. In contrast to the cochlear
(TRIC) feeder system, a feeder system with chicken embry-
onic inner ear used for hair cell differentiation (Oshima
et al., 2010) and feeder-free culture did not promote the
cell proliferation or GJP formation of iCx26GJCs. There-
fore, it is suggested that TRIC feeder cells may express
some molecules to promote the proliferation and GJP
formation of iCx26GJCs. Our working hypothesis is that
a small number of cells that differentiated from iPSCs
into CX26-expressing cells in modified SFEBq culture
were induced to proliferate by the growth factors that
were secreted from the cochlear feeder cells.
Our observation that iCx26GJCs co-expressed CX26
and CX30 (Figures 2K, 2L, and S4E–S4H) suggested that a
number of cells in the aggregates had differentiated into
cochlear non-sensory cells (Figures S4A–S4D) and gener-
ated CX26/CX30 GJPs; moreover, the data suggested that
these cells had proliferated on the cochlear feeder cells after
dissection of the small vesicles that were attached to the
outer epithelium (Movie S2).
As a marker of cochlear supporting cells, we assessed
P27Kip1 localization in iCx26GJCs. P27Kip1 is a cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitor that is thought to play a role
in maintaining the postmitotic state of cochlear support-
ing cells such as the Deiters’ cells and outer- and inner-
sulcus cells. The P27Kip1 signals were observed at the stage
at which colony expansion (Movie S2) had almost stopped
(�days 14–16). In the 2D cultures, we observed both
heterogeneous (Figures 2M and S5C–S5E) and homoge-
neous (Figures S5F–S5I) P27Kip1-positive regions including
iCx26GJCs. This suggests that a portion of the iCx26GJCs
gradually matures concomitantly with P27Kip1 expression
and that proliferation ceases when the cells stop expressing
P27Kip1 to maintain the postmitotic state, i.e., serving as
cochlear supporting cells (Figures S5A and S5B). White
et al. (2006) reported that isolated P27kip1-positive mouse
cochlear supporting cells retained the ability to divide
when cultured with periotic mesenchymal cells, which
support the growth and differentiation of cochlear sensory
progenitors. In the present study, we also used inner-ear
tissue-derived feeder cells for the differentiation and prolif-
eration of iPS-derived cells, and we generated CX26+/
P27Kip1+ supporting cell-like cells. These results suggest
that cochlear feeder cells support the proliferation and
further differentiation of iCx26GJCs.
We
assessed
SOX2
localization
in
iCx26GJCs
and
observed heterogeneous (Figures 2N and S6D–S6I) SOX2
expressions as in the adult mouse cochlea (Figures S6A–
S6C). Mak et al. (2009) reported that the SOX2 signals
were observed in the developing cochlear supporting cells,
such as the Deiters’ cells, Hensen cells, inner phalangeal
cells, pillar cells, and part of inner-sulcus cells.
These results, whereby iCx26GJCs and mouse cochleae
were stained with CX26, CX30, P27kip1, and SOX2 (Table
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 7 j 1023–1036 j December 13, 2016

 S1), suggested that iCx26GJCs are a cell type similar to the
cochlear supporting cells.
TEM of iPSC-derived aggregates detected an ultra-
structure typical of gap junctions (Figures 3A–3G). These
characteristic structures were observed in the two medium
conditions, BMP (Figures 3A–3E) and B/S (Figures 3F and
3G), but not in others (data not shown). These results
suggest that the upregulated CX26 and CX30 proteins (Fig-
ure 1A) formed gap junctions within the iPSC aggregates.
Prior to this study, little or no such ultrastructural forma-
tions typical of gap junctions had been reported as having
been reproducibly induced from ESCs/iPSCs. Scanning EM
of the cellular ultrastructure from 2D cultures at day 15
showed distinct straight cell borders that formed hexa-
gonal or pentagonal shapes with associated microvilli
dispersed along the borders (Figures 3J and 3K). This sug-
gested that the differentiated iPSCs formed the surface
structures typical of the inner and outer sulcus cells that
surround cochlear hair cells (Figures 3H and 3I).
The scrape-loading assay of iCx26GJCs showed gradients
and distance of dye transfers typical of those formed by
functional GJIC networks (Figures 4C, 4F, and 4J) as previ-
ously reported (Yum et al., 2007, 2010). In contrast, such
intercellular transfer of LY was not observed in undifferen-
tiated iPSCs or TRIC used as feeder cells (Figures 4A, 4B, 4D,
4E, and 4J). These results suggest that CX26 and CX30
formed functional GJIC networks among iCx26GJCs, as is
the case in cochlear tissue.
The Ca2+ imaging of 2D cultures revealed sponta-
neous Ca2+ transients and their propagation (Figures 5A,
5B, and 5D–5F; Movies S4 and S6), which is typical of the
developing cochlea. As the spontaneous Ca2+ signaling ac-
tivity was reversibly inhibited by a p2x receptor antagonist
(PPADS: Figure 5C [middle] and Movie S5) and connexin
hemichannel blocker (FFA: Figure 5C [bottom] and Movie
S5), these results suggested that the Ca2+ activities required
ATP and hemichannels, as has been reported for these ac-
tivities in developing cochlea (Schutz et al., 2010; Tritsch
et al., 2007).
Such spontaneous Ca2+ transients have been reported
in postnatal mouse cochlear supporting cells (Tritsch
et al., 2007), and the Ca2+ signals were suggested to be prop-
agated via gap junctions and hemichannels containing
CX26 and CX30 (Anselmi et al., 2008; Schutz et al.,
2010). It was also suggested that such spontaneous Ca2+
signals in supporting cells may play a crucial role in
generating the periodic, high-frequency burst of activity
observed in the auditory center of the brain (Wang et al.,
2015). Therefore, iCx26GJCs in the 2D cultures may differ-
entiate into postnatal cochlear supporting cells before the
onset of hearing.
In iCx26GJC from a CX26-deficient deafness mouse
model (CX26f/f P0-Cre), GJP formations showed visible
drastic disruption (Figures 6H, 6J, 6L, and 6N), reported
to be a primary pathology of GJB2-related hearing loss (Ka-
miya et al., 2014). This suggests that the iPSCs derived from
CX26f/f P0-Cre mouse have the potential to differentiate
into iCx26GJC as an in vitro disease model of GJB2-related
hearing loss. By using these cells, it is expected to establish
the drug screening and inner-ear cell therapy after in vitro
restoration of GJPs by the GJB2 gene transfer (Iizuka et al.,
2015) targeting GJB2-related hearing loss.
In summary, we hypothesize that iPS-derived cells
formed floating aggregate in serum-free medium (SFEBq
culture), after which the culture conditions including
BMP (BMP4) and TGF-b inhibitor (SB-431542) treatment
were selected to generate high-CX26/CX30 aggregates. Un-
like hair cell differentiation (Koehler and Hashino, 2014;
Koehler et al., 2013), these characteristic iPSC aggregates
form distinct epithelia and small vesicles attached to
the outer epithelium. In 2D culture, these small vesicles
colonized on TRIC feeder cells. The small vesicle-derived
colony
exhibits
proliferation
potency
and
contains
iCx26GJCs. The iCx26GJCs form functional CX26-GJPs
that exhibit spontaneous ATP- and hemichannel-mediated
Ca2+ transients typical of the developing cochlea. By using
this method, we generated the in vitro disease model cells
with GJP disruption for GJB2-related hearing loss (Figure 7).
In the present study, we demonstrated that the aggregate
formation of iPSCs under several medium conditions
followed by adherent culture with cochlear feeder cells
induced: (1) the upregulation of mRNAs encoding CX26/
CX30; (2) GJP formation composed of CX26/CX30; (3)
the ultrastructure typical of gap junctions; (4) functional
GJIC networks; and (5) spontaneous ATP- and hemichan-
nel-mediated Ca2+ transients typical of developing cochlea.
These are known to be the biological properties of cochlear
supporting cells. Cochlear supporting cells are the most
CX26-abundant cells that play crucial roles in maintaining
proper endocochlear potential via ion transport. Further-
more, the disease model cells with GJB2 mutation showing
drastic GJP disruptions in the present study are thought to
be the optimum therapeutic target for the treatment of
GJB2-related hearing loss, the most typical type of heredi-
tary deafness worldwide. It is expected, then, that these
iPS-derived cells, which can be obtained from patients,
will be particularly useful for drug screening and inner-
ear cell therapies targeting GJB2-related hearing loss.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
iPSC Lines and Maintenance Method
In the present study, we used five lines of mouse iPSCs. Two
cell
lines
(cell
names:
iPS-MEF-Ng-178B-5
and
iPS-MEF-FB/
Ng-440A-3) were provided by RIKEN Bio Resource Center Cell
Bank, and we generated three cell lines from murine embryonic
1032
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 7 j 1023–1036 j December 13, 2016
 fibroblasts (Oriental Yeast), murine cochlear fibroblasts derived
from C57BL/6J mice, and fibroblasts derived from CX26f/f
P0-Cre-mice that we have developed as a model for GJB2-related
hearing loss (Kamiya et al., 2014) using Sendai virus vectors (Cyto-
tune-iPS, DNAVEC). These five iPSC lines were maintained in
feeder-free conditions.
All experimental protocols using mouse tissues were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Juntendo
University School of Medicine and were conducted in accordance
with the US National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals.
iPSC Differentiation
Experiments covering days 0–11 of differentiation were performed
as described previously (Koehler and Hashino, 2014; Koehler et al.,
2013) with slight modifications. On day 3, BMP4 (10 ng/mL) and
SB431542 (1 mM), either separately or together, were added at 53
concentration in 25 mL of fresh medium to the wells corresponding
to BMP, SB, or BMP/SB, respectively. On day 4, FGF2 (25 ng/mL)
and LDN193189 (1 mM), either separately or together, were added
at 63 concentration in 25 mL of fresh medium to the wells corre-
sponding to B/S + FGF, B/S + LDN, and F/L, respectively. On
days 7–11, the regions with small vesicles transferred to inner-
ear-derived feeder cells. TRICs were generated by overexposing
cochlear tissue to trypsin and screening for the trypsin-resistant
colonies. The adult (10-week-old mice) cochlear tissue used for
the preparation of TRIC included the organ of Corti, basilar mem-
brane, and lateral wall. They are mainly composed of supporting
cells, hair cells, cochlear fibrocytes, and the other cells in the basilar
membrane. This cell line was used as inner-ear-derived feeder
cells to proliferate the otic progenitor cells. For the preparation of
feeder cell layers, 3 3 105/cm2 TRICs were seeded on gelatin-coated
24-well culture plates after mitomycin C (10 mg/ml) treatment
for 3 hr.
qPCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen) and
was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a PrimeScript II first-
strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Takara). Real-time PCR was performed
with the reverse transcription products, TaqMan Fast advanced
master mix (Applied Biosystems), and gene-specific TaqMan Probe
(Applied Biosystems) on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems). The Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast software
was used to analyze the CT values of different mRNAs normalized
to an endogenous control (ACTB). TaqMan Probes (Assay ID;
Applied Biosystems) were used to detect expression of mouse

Hearing Loss
Undifferentiated
iPSCs
formed
floating
aggregate in serum-free medium (SFEBq
culture). SFEBq culture generates neuro-
ectoderm
tissues
such
as
retinal
and
neuronal tissues. Non-neural ectoderm such
as inner-ear hair cell is also generated
by this culture. The culture conditions
including BMP (BMP4) and TGF-b inhibitor
(SB-431542) treatment were selected to
generate high-CX26/CX30 aggregates with
high mRNA expressions. Unlike hair cell
differentiation, these characteristic iPSC
aggregates form distinct epithelia and small
vesicles attached to the outer epithelium.
After the removal of NANOG(+)-undifferen-
tiated region, these small vesicles, which
contain iCx26GJCs, are dissected and added
onto cochlear feeder cells. They attach to
the cochlear feeder cells (TRIC) and undergo
colony expansion. The small vesicle-derived
colony exhibits proliferation potency and
contains iCx26GJCs. The iCx26GJCs form
functional CX26-GJPs that exhibit spon-
taneous ATP- and hemichannel-mediated
Ca2+ transients typical of the developing
cochlea. In GJB2 (CX26) mutant iPSCs, GJP
disruption, which has been reported to be a
primary pathology of GJB2-related hearing
loss, is recapitulated in vitro.

 GJB2 (Mm00433643_s1), GJB6 (Mm00433661_s1), and ACTB
(Mm02619580_g1).
Immunohistochemistry
The following primary antibodies were used: CX26 (mouse immu-
noglobulin G [IgG], 33-5800, Life Technologies), CX30 (rabbit IgG,
71-2200, Life Technologies), P27kip1 (rabbit IgG, RB-9019-P0, Neo
Markers), and SOX2 (goat IgG, sc-17320, Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology). The following secondary antibodies were used: Cy3-con-
jugated anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor
594-conjugated anti-goat IgG, and phalloidin TRITC.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Aggregates were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutar-
aldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 24 hr at 4�C and post-
fixed for 1.5 hr with 2% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer.
Aggregates were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series
and embedded in Epon. Aggregate sections were stained with ura-
nyl acetate and lead citrate and examined by EM (Model H-7700,
Hitachi).
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Aggregates, 2D cultures, and mouse cochleae were fixed with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS for 24 hr at 4�C and postfixed with 2%
osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M PBS for 2 hr. Samples were dehydrated
in ethanol and freeze-dried with tert-butyl alcohol in a freeze dryer
(ES-2030; Hitachi). After drying, samples were coated with osmium
tetroxide and visualized with a scanning electron microscope
(S-4800; Hitachi) at an accelerating voltage of 3.0 kV.
Dye Transfer with Scrape Loading
Dye transfer was investigated using a scrape-loading assay (Yum
et al., 2007). iCx26GJC-containing proliferated cells were grown
for 7–14 days after transfer onto TRIC feeder cells. The undifferen-
tiated iPSCs and TRIC feeder cells were grown to confluency on
coverslips as control. The medium was changed to Hank’s balanced
salt solution plus 0.1% LY (LY CH, Invitrogen). Many parallel lines
were cut into the dish with a razor blade, and after 15 min cells
scrape-loaded with LY were washed three times with Hank’s
balanced salt solution and imaged. Scrape loading was quantified
by measuring the distance from the scrape line to the point where
the fluorescence intensity dropped to 1.53 the background inten-
sity. The images were processed and analyzed with NIH ImageJ
software, and the mean distance was calculated using Microsoft
Excel software.
Ca2+ Imaging and Pharmacological Study
The propagation of spontaneous Ca2+ transients via gap junc-
tions in iCx26GJCs was carried out using methods modified
from a previous study (Schutz et al., 2010). Samples were incu-
bated for 20 min at 37�C in high-calcium Dulbecco’s PBS
(DPBS) containing 2 mM CaCl2 (Nacalai Tesque) in DPBS (Gibco)
supplemented with 5 mM fluo-4 AM (Dojindo), 0.01% (w/v)
pluronic F-127 (Invitrogen), and 250 mM sulfinpyrazone (Sigma)
as loading medium. To record spontaneous Ca2+ transients, we
replaced the loading medium with low-calcium DPBS, which con-
tained 20 mM CaCl2.
The pharmacological study of iCx26GJCs was carried out using
methods modified from previous studies (Schutz et al., 2010;
Tritsch et al., 2007). The spontaneous Ca2+ activity was recorded
for 3 min, then the cells were superfused with PPADS (50 mM;
Tocris) or FFA (50 mM; Sigma) for 5 min, followed by washout
of the drug and superfusion with low-Ca2+ DPBS for 8 min.
Sequential fluorescence images were acquired using a Nipkow
disc confocal system (CSU22, Yokogawa) and AQUACOSMOS
software (Hamamatsu Photonics). Live-cell imaging experiments
were performed at near-physiological temperature (32�–35�C)
or room temperature (24�–26�C). Signals were measured as
relative changes of fluorescence intensity (Df/f0), where f0 is
the minimum fluorescence and f is the recorded fluorescence,
and Df = f � f0.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel software. Data are pre-
sented as mean ± SE. Statistical tests were performed using a two-
tailed Student’s t test with a significance criterion of p < 0.05 to
compare relative mRNA levels, number of iCx26GJCs, and the
GJP length. Scheffe’s multiple comparison test, with a significance
criterion of p < 0.05, was used to compare the distance of dye
transfer.
