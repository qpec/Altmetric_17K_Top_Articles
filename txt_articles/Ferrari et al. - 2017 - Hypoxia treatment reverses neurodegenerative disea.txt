Breathing 11% O2 in late-stage neurological disease reverses the radiographic lesions of Ndufs4 mice seen on MRI. Four Ndufs4 mice were breathing
21% O2 until they developed late-stage neurological disease (55 d). They underwent MRI to document bilateral lesions in the vestibular nuclei (Upper, white
arrow). Subsequently they commenced breathing 11% oxygen. The mice were scanned again at 2 wk and 4 wk of hypoxic breathing (Middle and Lower,
respectively). Neurologic lesions disappeared by 4 wk of hypoxic breathing. The section of the fourth ventricle shown at the center of the brainstem appeared
enlarged in the early scans, suggesting parenchymal atrophy. After 4 wk of treatment, this area appeared to be reduced in size, and morphological rela-
tionships were restored.

The most common pediatric mitochondrial disease is Leigh syn-
drome, an episodic, subacute neurodegeneration that can lead to
death within the first few years of life, for which there are no
proven general therapies. Mice lacking the complex I subunit, Ndufs4,
develop a fatal progressive encephalopathy resembling Leigh syn-
drome and die at ≈60 d of age. We previously reported that contin-
uously breathing normobaric 11% O2 from an early age prevents
neurological disease and dramatically improves survival in these
mice. Here, we report three advances. First, we report updated sur-
vival curves and organ pathology in Ndufs4 KO mice exposed to
hypoxia or hyperoxia. Whereas normoxia-treated KO mice die from
neurodegeneration at about 60 d, hypoxia-treated mice eventually
die at about 270 d, likely from cardiac disease, and hyperoxia-treated
mice die within days from acute pulmonary edema. Second, we
report that more conservative hypoxia regimens, such as contin-
uous normobaric 17% O2 or intermittent hypoxia, are ineffective
in preventing neuropathology. Finally, we show that breathing
normobaric 11% O2 in mice with late-stage encephalopathy re-
verses their established neurological disease, evidenced by im-
proved behavior, circulating disease biomarkers, and survival
rates. Importantly, the pathognomonic MRI brain lesions and
neurohistopathologic findings are reversed after 4 wk of hyp-
oxia. Upon return to normoxia, Ndufs4 KO mice die within days.
Future work is required to determine if hypoxia can be used to
prevent and reverse neurodegeneration in other animal models,
and to determine if it can be provided in a safe and practical
manner to allow in-hospital human therapeutic trials.

efects in mitochondrial function, owing to mutations either
in the nuclear genome or in the mitochondrial DNA, result
in severe diseases that can present at any point from infancy
through adulthood (1). The most common biochemical class of
mitochondrial disorders arises from genetic mutations affecting
the mitochondrial respiratory chain, with an incidence of ∼1 in
4,300 live births (2). The management of these disorders is
challenging in part because of their clinical and genetic hetero-
geneity. Virtually any organ system can be impacted, and more
than 250 genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are known to be
disease-causing (3). Of these, at least 150 can underlie disorders
of oxidative phosphorylation. The mainstay of therapy involves
using vitamin mixtures with little or no proven efficacy, as well as
avoiding drugs known to be mitochondrial toxins.
Leigh syndrome, the most common pediatric manifestation of
mitochondrial disease, is characterized by bilaterally symmet-
ric lesions in the gray matter of the brainstem, basal ganglia, or
cerebellum. It affects ∼1 in 40,000 live births and can be due to
mutations in any of 75 different genes (4). Children with this
disorder often become hypotonic and may develop vision and
hearing loss. Although the course of disease can vary widely
among individuals, severely affected children can experience de-
velopmental delay and ultimately succumb to respiratory failure
within the first few years of life. These patients are typically
healthy at birth but then experience a neurometabolic crisis, often
in the context of a febrile illness, resulting in psychomotor re-
gression and death within the first few years of life. Diagnosis is
based on clinical presentation and classic findings on T2-weighted
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A small subset of these
disorders are related to defects in vitamin transport and alleviated
with dietary supplementation, such as in the case of riboflavin,
thiamine, and biotin deficiencies (5, 6); however, there are no
proven therapies for the vast majority of these disorders. Several
new experimental strategies are currently under investigation in
preclinical and clinical settings, including agents that target oxi-
dative stress, the mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway, NAD+
pool sizes, and complex I bypass (idebenone) (7–10).
We recently demonstrated the therapeutic potential of hyp-
oxia in preventing mitochondrial disease. We reported that
chronically exposing the Ndufs4 mouse model of Leigh syndrome
(11, 12) to breathing 11% O2 at normobaria before disease
onset markedly extended the lifespan, improved behavior, and
prevented neurodegeneration (13). Furthermore, we demon-
strated that breathing 55% O2, a level that is well tolerated by
WT mice, led to rapid death of the diseased mice.
Significance
Inherited or acquired defects in mitochondria lead to devas-
tating disorders for which we have no effective general ther-
apies. We recently reported that breathing normobaric 11% O2
prevents neurodegeneration in a mouse model of a pediatric
mitochondrial disease, Leigh syndrome. Here we provide
updated survival curves of mice treated with varying doses of
oxygen and explore eventual causes of death. We explore al-
ternative hypoxia regimens and report that neither intermittent
nor moderate hypoxia regimens suffice to prevent neurological
disease. Finally, we show that hypoxia can not only prevent, but
also reverses the brain lesions in mice with advanced neuropa-
thology. Our preclinical studies will help guide future clinical
studies aimed at harnessing hypoxia as a safe and practical
therapy.

 The goal of our present study was to build on this initial work
(13) to better understand the disease course and pathophysiology
of these mice when breathing different O2 levels, and to explore
alternative hypoxia regimens. We provide an update of the survival
curves under hypoxia and carefully assess how variations of O2
concentration and exposure duration affect organ pathology. We
show that intermittent or more moderate hypoxia regimens are
ineffective, and report that the effects of chronic breathing of 11%
O2 are not durable if mice return to breathing 21% O2. Impor-
tantly, we demonstrate that breathing 11% O2 can not only pre-
vent, but also reverse, established neurodegenerative disease in
this murine model.
Results
Breathing 11% O2 Prevents the Development of Brain Lesions
Throughout the Life of Ndufs4 KO Mice. To investigate the thera-
peutic potential of hypoxia treatment on mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion, we studied whether hypoxia is capable of preventing the
neurodegenerative disease rather than simply delaying its onset
(Fig. 1 A–E). KO and WT controls were randomized to breathe
either 21% or 11% O2 starting at 30 d of age. As reported pre-
viously (13), our initial cohort of control KO mice breathing 21%
O2 all died between 42 and 75 d (median, 58 d). In contrast, KO
mice breathing 11% O2 were still alive at 170 d (13). Here we
report an updated survival curve, showing that KO mice breathing
11% O2 had an overall median survival duration of 270 d (log-
rank, P < 0.0001 vs. 21% O2 controls) (Fig. 1A). To investigate the
chronic physiological adaptation to hypoxia, we measured the
venous hematocrit of mice after 9 mo of breathing 11% O2. Ve-
nous hematocrit was elevated, albeit to a lesser extent, in KO mice
compared with WT controls (47 ± 2% vs. 55 ± 5%, respectively;
P < 0.05; n = 8) (Fig. 1B). The circulating plasma disease bio-
markers lactate and α-hydroxybutyrate are elevated in humans
with Leigh syndrome and in the Ndufs4 mouse model (14). In our
original report (13), both markers were partially normalized in KO
mice breathing 11% oxygen. At 250 d, α-hydroxybutyrate trended
toward a partial rescue in KO mice breathing 11% oxygen (39 ±
8 μM; n = 7) relative to normoxic-breathing KO mice at day 50
(13), although the difference was not statistically significant (Fig.
1D). At 250 d, plasma lactate levels in KO mice breathing 11% O2
were similarly ameliorated (Fig. 1E) relative to normoxic-breathing
KO mice at 50 d (13).
To study whether hypoxic breathing delays death by delaying the
onset of CNS lesions, we performed T2-weighted brain MRI
studies of lightly anesthetized mice chronically breathing either
21% or 11% O2 (n = 4). KO mice breathing 21% O2 developed
lesions in the posterolateral portion of the brainstem, localized to
the vestibular nuclei. Lesions became evident at 55 d of age (Fig.
2B). In contrast, brain MRI scans performed in KO mice breathing
11% O2 showed no signs of neurologic lesions even at 250 d.
We next assessed neuropathology in the same cohort of mice.
Brains were stained for the inflammatory activation marker Iba-1
(Fig. 2A). KO mice breathing 21% O2 displayed significant
microglial activation in both the cerebellum and olfactory bulb
(OB) by 50 d. In contrast, KO mice breathing 11% O2 displayed
no accumulation of Iba-1 in the cerebellum, OB, or brainstem at
250 d. In the latter group, brain sections were comparable to
those of hypoxic, age-matched WT mice (n = 4). These findings
suggest that the cause of death in older, hypoxia-treated KO
mice might differ from the progressive neurodegenerative dis-
ease of normoxia-treated KO mice. This led us to explore the
functional alterations of other organs known to be involved in
mitochondrial disease pathology.
Ndufs4 KO Mice Breathing 11% O2 for >150 d Exhibit Mild Left
Ventricular Dysfunction. A common presentation of pediatric mi-
tochondrial disease is cardiomyopathy, with left ventricular (LV)
dysfunction negatively affecting prognosis in up to 20% of cases
(15). The pathogenesis of cardiac pathology is incompletely un-
derstood. The sudden death of some of our >170-d-old KO mice
breathing 11% O2 led us to investigate their cardiac function (Fig.
3 A–F). To do so, we obtained echocardiograms in mildly sedated
mice at 200 d (Fig. 3 A and C). Using ultrasound, we detected
decreased LV fractional shortening in KO mice compared with
WT mice breathing 11% O2 at 200 d (37 ± 4% vs. 57 ± 9%; P <
0.05; n = 6 in each group) (Fig. 3 A and C).
We also examined ventricular function by MRI at 9.4 T with a
gradient echo cine sequence (Fig. 3F) (16). The age-matched WT
mice were anesthetized with 1–2% isoflurane, whereas the KO mice
were anesthetized using 0.3% isoflurane owing to their increased
sensitivity to anesthetic agents (17). Scans were performed while the
mice were breathing 21% O2. Body temperature was maintained in
the physiological range with a warm air blower. Heart rate averaged
∼400 bpm in WT mice and 300 bpm in KO mice. LV function
assessed by cardiac MRI demonstrated a reduced LV ejection
fraction in KO mice treated by breathing 11% O2 at >200 d of age,
compared with WT controls breathing 11% O2 at the same age
(56 ± 7% vs. 69 ± 2%; P < 0.05; n = 3 in each group) (Fig. 3D),
confirming the echocardiographic findings. Assessment of right

 ventricular ejection fraction also revealed no significant differ-
ences between KO and WT mice (58 ± 1% vs. 58 ± 1%; P = 0.97;
n = 3 in each group) (Fig. 3E). Of note, ECG sporadically
revealed intermittent atrioventricular blockade in hypoxia-treated
KO mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Furthermore, no differ-
ences in LV fractional shortening were detected between hypoxia-
treated KO mice at 50 d and age-matched KO controls breathing
21% O2 (Fig. 3B).
Breathing 55% O2 Causes Acute Lung Edema and Isolated OB Lesions
in Ndufs4 KO Mice. To further understand the critical role of in-
haled oxygen concentration on mitochondrial disease progression,
we investigated the physiological effects of breathing 55% O2. We
previously reported the remarkable sensitivity of KO mice to mild
hyperoxic breathing (13). On exposure to breathing 55% O2, KO
mice died between 48 h and 10 d, with a median survival of 5 d. To
assess whether supplemental O2 exacerbates the original neuro-
logic disease, we obtained brain MRI scans in KO mice that had
been breathing 55% O2 for 24 h. Imaging showed hyperintense
lesions in the OB, but no lesions in the brainstem (Fig. 4D),
suggesting augmented O2 sensitivity of the olfactory cells of mice
exposed to hyperoxia via the nasal epithelium, but not in the
brainstem via the arterial circulation.
We then focused our attention on the lung, an organ known to
be sensitive to supplemental O2 toxicity. It is known that breathing
100% O2 results in pulmonary edema within several days in WT
mice (18). Thus, we wondered whether similar pathology would
ensue at a more moderate hyperoxia exposure in KO mice. To
estimate pulmonary edema, we assessed the wet-to-dry lung
weight (WD) ratio (19). Mice were exposed to 55% O2 for 24 h
starting at 30 d of age. The WD ratio was elevated, at 5.63 ±
0.6 in KO mice and 4.38 ± 0.02 in WT controls (P < 0.001; n =
7) (Fig. 4A), indicating significant acute pulmonary edema.
Furthermore, lung myeloperoxidase activity at 24 h was
4.6-fold greater than that of WT controls (23 ± 8 vs. 5 ± 4 U/g;
P < 0.001; n = 7) (Fig. 4B), suggesting significant neutrophil
infiltration.
To further investigate lung pathology, we performed H&E
staining at 48 h in mice breathing 55% O2. We observed the
presence of alveolocapillary membrane swelling, inflammatory
cell infiltration, extensive capillary disruption, and hemorrhagic
extravasation of red cells into alveoli (n = 4). These findings were
specific to the KO mice breathing 55% O2 (Fig. 4C).
Intermittent 11% O2 Breathing Is Not Effective. Intermittent hypoxic
exposure is currently used in sports training, aviation, and clinical
studies of sleep apnea (20–22). Because nighttime hypoxia
therapy would allow unhindered patient mobility during the day,
we tested whether such a regimen would have a therapeutic ef-
fect on KO mice. Starting at 30 d, Ndufs4 KO mice breathed
11% O2 for 10 h each day from 9 AM to 7 PM (while sleeping),
and 21% O2 for the remaining 14 h (while awake nocturnally).
Daily intermittent exposure to breathing 11% O2 increased the
venous hematocrit to 56 ± 4% within 3 wk (n = 4) (Fig. 5E),
indicating a systemic physiological response to hypoxia. How-
ever, the survival time of these mice was not increased relative to
that of mice continuously breathing 21% O2 (58.5 d vs. 58.5 d;
log-rank P = 0.77; HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.45–2.96; n = 8) (Fig. 5A).
During exposure to intermittent hypoxia, body weight decreased
until humane euthanasia criteria were eventually met. Of note,
KO mice undergoing the intermittent hypoxic protocol had a
significantly lower body weight at 60 d compared with control
mice breathing 21% O2 (10.6 ± 0.8 g vs. 12.1 ± 1.1 g; P < 0.05;
n = 6) (Fig. 5B). Core body temperature at 50 d was low in both
groups (32.4 ± 0.9 °C vs. 35.0 ± 1.5 °C; P < 0.06; n = 8) (Fig. 5C).
We tested the ability of KO mice to remain on an accelerating,
rotating rod, and found no significant difference between KO
mice after 3 wk of intermittent hypoxia treatment and control
KO mice breathing 21% O2 (Fig. 5D).
We further studied whether brain lesions in the Leigh syndrome
model were ameliorated by intermittent 11% O2 hypoxic breath-
ing. All four MRI scans of KO mice receiving intermittent treat-
ment revealed hyperintense lesions in the brainstem and OB by
60 d, resembling the neurologic lesions seen in mice breathing
21% O2 at the same age (Fig. 5F). Thus, although intermittent
11% O2 hypoxia was sufficient to trigger certain aspects of hypoxia
adaptation, such as hematocrit elevation, intermittent hypoxia did
not prevent the progression of KO neuropathology.
Milder Hypoxic Breathing Regimens Are Not Effective. We previously
reported the results of KO mice breathing normobaric 11% O2,
equivalent to the partial pressure of oxygen found at an altitude of
4,500 m. In the present study, we investigated whether chronic
exposure to a milder level of hypoxia would be sufficient to prevent
encephalopathic disease. Breathing 17% O2 for 3 wk, equivalent to
living at 1,800 m, starting at 30 d of age did not prevent Leigh
syndrome in KO mice (Fig. 6A). After 3 wk of treatment, the core
temperature of mice breathing 17% O2 and normoxic controls was

 reduced to 35.9 ± 0.7 °C and 35.0 ± 1.5 °C, respectively (P = not
significant; n = 6) (Fig. 6C). In the same mice, body weight was not
significantly changed at 60 d (12.5 ± 1.3 g vs. 12.1 ± 1.1 g; P = 0.54;
n = 6) (Fig. 6B). Moreover, all KO mice met the humane eutha-
nasia criteria by 90 d (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.20–1.13; log-rank P =
0.07, 17% vs. 21% O2; n = 6).
To assess the levels of hypoxemia resulting from changes in in-
haled oxygen levels, we measured both murine arterial partial
pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and peripheral saturation of oxygen
(SpO2) in WT mice. Mice acutely breathing 17% O2 had a mean
PaO2 of 77.5 ± 8 mmHg and a mean transcutaneous SpO2 of 88.5 ±
3%. Breathing 11% O2 resulted in a mean PaO2 of 45 ± 4 mmHg
and mean SpO2 of 61.3 ± 2.5% (n = 5) (Table 1), resulting in a
similar PaO2 as seen in humans breathing equivalent O2 pressures
(23, 24). After 3 wk of chronic 17% O2 breathing, the value of venous
hematocrit in KO mice was 51 ± 3%, compared with 60 ± 6% at
11% O2 (normoxic control level, 44 ± 6%), (P < 0.05 between
groups; n = 6) (Fig. 6D). These findings suggest that breathing 17%
O2 triggered an intermediate physiological hematocrit response, but
did not prevent the manifestations of neurologic disease.

erative disease, we transitioned three KO mice that were breathing

Breathing 11% O2 Reverses Clinical Manifestations of Leigh Syndrome.
Patients with Leigh syndrome are typically diagnosed after an
acute metabolic crisis, with the concomitant presence of bilateral
lesions detectable by brain MRI (25). Thus, the degenerative brain
disease usually manifests before diagnosis. We previously dem-
onstrated that starting hypoxic breathing at an early age (30 d) can
prevent the onset of neuropathological disease in the KO mouse
model (13). An even more clinically relevant question is whether
neuropathological disease can be reversed after its onset. To assess
this possibility, we initiated therapeutic hypoxia exposure just be-
fore death in untreated KO mice breathing 21% O2 (55 d). We
randomly assigned the KO mice to one of three treatment groups:

 group A, starting 11% O2 breathing (hypoxia) at 30 d; group B,
starting 11% O2 breathing at 55 d; and group C, 21% O2 normoxic
breathing controls (Table 2). Mice in all three cohorts appeared
healthy at 30 d. By age 55 d, the average body weight was 16.1 ±
3.7 g in group A, 11.6 ± 1.1 in group B, and 11.6 ± 0.9 g in group C
(P < 0.05, group A vs. group B and group A vs. group C; n = 8).
Mice in group A demonstrated an upward growth curve trajectory,
whereas those in groups B and C exhibited an identical decrease in
body weight (P < 0.05, group A vs. group B and group A vs. group
C) (Fig. 7A). At 60 d of age, the mice in group B were on the fifth
day of breathing 11% O2 and showed an upward weight gain
trajectory, whereas the mice in group C continued to lose weight
rapidly. By 100 d, the average body weight was 17.7 ± 2.5 g in
group A and 16.5 ± 1.9 g in group B (P = 0.33; n = 8).
In group B mice, average rectal temperature was 33.5 ± 1.2 °C
at 5 d before and 35.3 ± 0.9 °C at 5 d after the initiation of 11%
O2 breathing (P < 0.01; n = 8). Temperature remained stable at
subsequent time points (Fig. 7B). Mice in group B could run on
an accelerating, rotating rod for 38 ± 23 s at 50 d of age. At age
100 d, endurance on the rotating rod had partially recovered, to
82 ± 73 s (P < 0.05; n = 9) (Fig. 7C). Ultimately, >70% of the
mice in this group were alive at 210 d, as opposed to a median
survival of 55 d in group C (HR, 9.7; 95% CI, 3.1–30.1; log-rank
P < 0.001, n = 13) (Fig. 7D). Furthermore, we obtained plasma
samples at 40, 50, 60, and 70 d of age from mice in group B. Two
previously
reported
Leigh
disease
biomarkers
(13,
14),
α-hydroxybutyrate and lactate, were progressively elevated in
normoxia with neurodegenerative disease and decreased after
5 d or 15 d of 11% O2 breathing (t test P < 0.05, 50 d vs. 70 d; n =
5–8 per group) (Fig. 7 E and F). Thus, treating diseased mice
with hypoxic breathing after they manifest neurologic disease at
55 d leads to weight gain, increased core temperature, and im-
proved endurance and stability running on a rotating rod, with a
significantly increased duration of survival.
Breathing 11% O2 Reverses Brain Lesions in Ndufs4 KO Mice with Late-
Stage Disease. Patients with Leigh syndrome develop symmetric,
bilateral neurologic lesions, leading to respiratory failure during
childhood. A similar mode of pathogenesis has been demon-
strated in KO mice breathing 21% O2, with disturbances in the
normal respiratory pattern causing death due to respiratory failure
between 55 d and 70 d (11, 12). To determine whether the rescue
of lifespan and behavior are accompanied by a reversal of the
brain lesions, we performed sequential brain MRI scans in four
KO mice that had developed the encephalopathic disease
breathing 21% O2 and then breathed 11% O2 after developing
late-stage neurologic disease (treatment group B; Table 2). After
their first MRI brain scan, at 55 d, the mice commenced breathing
11% O2. Brain MRI was repeated after 2 wk and again after 4 wk
of breathing 11% O2, (Fig. 8). Neuroimaging showed progressive
reductions in the intensity and size of lesions in the brainstem and
OB after the first 2 wk of hypoxic breathing. In mice with late-
stage brain disease, the fourth ventricle appeared more diffuse,
likely due to parenchymal atrophy. This abnormal morphology
was reversed on breathing 11% O2. The aforementioned disease
pattern was reversed in all four mice studied.
Finally, to verify our neuroradiologic results, we assessed Iba-1
staining in the same mice treated for >150 d. In these mice, the
inflammatory response was no longer present, and hypoxia-
rescued brains appeared histologically similar to WT controls
(Fig. 9). Future studies will investigate the biochemical nature of
pathology reversal. The ability of hypoxia to reverse neurologic
lesions may have significant implications for clinical applications,
as well as for our understanding of the rescue mechanism.
Discussion
We previously demonstrated that early-onset chronic exposure
of the Ndufs4 KO mouse model of Leigh syndrome to breathing
11% O2 prevented the onset of neurodegenerative disease and
extended the duration of KO survival. The goal of our present
study was to explore the disease course and pathophysiology of
these mice when exposed to breathing different oxygen tensions,
and to determine whether alternative hypoxia exposure regimens
could be useful. To our knowledge, no other therapeutic ap-
proach has demonstrated such high levels of efficacy in mouse
models of mitochondrial encephalopathy.
We previously reported that hypoxia extends, and hyperoxia
reduces, the lifespan of mice with Ndufs4 deficiency, but even-
tual lifespan and organ pathologies were not yet known. Here we
have shown that whereas Ndufs4 KO mice breathing 21% O2
develop subacute neurodegeneration, those breathing 11% O2
do not show signs of neurodegeneration at age >200 d, but rather
develop mild LV dysfunction and eventually die at a median age
of 270 d. Previous studies have shown that cardiac-specific
Ndufs4 KO mice breathing 21% O2 developed mild cardiac
dysfunction (26, 27). Although we cannot conclusively define the
cause of death in our hypoxia-treated KO mice, we did observe
cardiac dysfunction at age >200 d. In contrast, untreated KO
mice breathing 21% O2 did not exhibit cardiac dysfunction at
50 d, just before their death. One interpretation of these findings
is that hypoxic breathing at 11% O2 is able to prevent neuro-
degeneration, but not eventual cardiac dysfunction.

 We found that breathing 55% O2 resulted in rapid death of
Ndufs4 KO mice from acute pulmonary edema resulting from
acute pulmonary O2 toxicity, with no MRI evidence of brainstem
lesions that were responsible for the death of the untreated mice.
The lungs of WT mice exposed to breathing similar O2 levels for
similar periods were normal. This observation is consistent with
hyperoxic pulmonary pathology in WT mice at much higher O2
levels (e.g., 100% FiO2) or even at hyperbaric oxygen pressures
(18). It is notable that the respiratory epithelium and the primary
olfactory neurons are in direct contact with extremely high inhaled
oxygen tensions (not requiring blood oxygen delivery). Our path-
ophysiological findings highlight the variable tissue-specific oxygen
sensitivities of the nose, lung, brain, and heart of Ndufs4 KO mice
with diffusely impaired oxidative metabolism across all of their
tissues. We speculate that these differences arise from variations
in metabolic flexibility, such as the ability to rely on glycolytic ATP
production (28–30), or, alternatively, differences in the ability of
these tissues to compensate for oxidative stress (31).
Perhaps the most exciting finding of the present study is that
hypoxia can reverse brain lesions of established Leigh syndrome.
Most mitochondrial disorders are diagnosed after the first meta-
bolic crisis, and often it is the T2-intense lesions detected on brain
MRI that are indicative of mitochondrial disease and help define
the diagnosis. Of note, inherited deficiencies of vitamins, such as
thiamine, riboflavin, and biotin, also can lead to Leigh syndrome.
Such a deficiency in a mitochondrial metabolite transporter is one
of the few truly treatable forms of Leigh disease (5, 6). Our finding
that body weight, body temperature, behavior, and even neuro-
radiographic and histopathological lesions can be reversed within
a few weeks by 11% O2 breathing offers hope more generally for
diverse genetic etiologies of established Leigh disease. We hy-
pothesize two means by which this could take place: (i) either
hypoxia is removing the proximal cause of the damage, and thus
endogenous repair mechanisms can occur, or (ii) hypoxia actively
triggers repair mechanisms that restore damaged tissue. Car-
diomyocytes are known to be capable of regeneration and pro-
liferation when exposed to very low oxygen levels even after
completion of fetal development (32). Furthermore, hypoxia re-
cently has been shown to improve adult neurogenesis (33–35).
An important question is whether the doses of hypoxia used in
mice in the present study can be extrapolated to humans. We are
optimistic about this prospect. Our healthy hypoxic mice breathing
11% oxygen had an average PaO2 of 45 mmHg (Table 1). Human
volunteers at the Mont Blanc research station (4,559 m), equiva-
lent to breathing 11% oxygen at sea level, had an average PaO2 of
46 mmHg (36). Of course, the ability of hemoglobin to bind O2 is

 lower in mice than in humans, which is why murine arterial oxygen
saturation (SaO2) is lower despite a comparable PaO2 (Table 1).
Nonetheless, if PaO2 is the key parameter in alleviating mito-
chondrial pathology, an 11% FiO2 in humans ought to be com-
parable to that in mice. Furthermore, in murine models of chronic
hypoxia (37), breathing 11% oxygen at sea level produces pul-
monary hypertension like that seen in humans, suggesting that the
pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to breathing 11% oxygen is
conserved across both species. Thus, several major aspects of ox-
ygen transport and physiology show comparable dose responses in
humans and mice.
Although chronic, continuous 11% O2 breathing has a dramatic
effect in Ndufs4 KO mice, more practical regimens are desirable.
In the present study, however, we found that neither more mod-
erate, chronic hypoxic breathing of 17% O2 nor intermittent 11%
O2 breathing for a duration of 10 h each day was effective. We also
found that the therapeutic effects of chronic hypoxia in mice do
not appear to be durable; when hypoxia-treated mice were
returned to normoxic breathing, they died after 1 wk of air
breathing. Thus, the only currently available regimen that prevents
and reverses Leigh syndrome in Ndufs4 KO mice is continuously
breathing 11% O2.
Although the Ndufs4 KO mouse is perhaps the most accurate
mouse model of Leigh syndrome, its disease trajectory is distinct
from that of humans. In particular, this mouse exhibits very uni-
form, downward trajectories of body temperature, body weight, and
activity, typically dying at around day 55. The disease course in
humans tends to be more variable and episodic, and in fact, more
practical hypoxia regimens may be intermittently effective in helping
repair neurodegenerative lesions in humans. Future investigations
are needed to determine whether hypoxia can be delivered safely
and effectively as therapy for mitochondrial diseases.
Methods
Animal Care. Ndufs4+/− mice were generously provided by the Palmiter lab-
oratory at the University of Washington. We continuously bred heterozy-
gous mice to provide sufficient Ndufs4−/− and control (Ndufs4+/− and WT)
mice for our experiments. Because Ndufs4+/− and WT mice are identical in all
reported assays performed by us and others, we treated both groups as
controls. Pups were weaned and genotyped at ∼25 d after birth. All cages
were provided with daily food, water, and hydrated gel (Hydrogel). Food

Breathing 11% O2 in late-stage neurological disease reverses the radiographic lesions of Ndufs4 mice seen on MRI. Four Ndufs4 mice were breathing
21% O2 until they developed late-stage neurological disease (55 d). They underwent MRI to document bilateral lesions in the vestibular nuclei (Upper, white
arrow). Subsequently they commenced breathing 11% oxygen. The mice were scanned again at 2 wk and 4 wk of hypoxic breathing (Middle and Lower,
respectively). Neurologic lesions disappeared by 4 wk of hypoxic breathing. The section of the fourth ventricle shown at the center of the brainstem appeared
enlarged in the early scans, suggesting parenchymal atrophy. After 4 wk of treatment, this area appeared to be reduced in size, and morphological rela-
tionships were restored.

 and gel were replaced three times per week, and cages were changed
weekly (additional food was placed on the bedding). Body weights were
recorded regularly, and mice were humanely euthanized when they had lost
20% of peak body weight, in accordance with the most recent American
Veterinary Medical Association guidelines. Animals were randomized on a
1:1 basis, balanced by age and sex. All animal studies were approved by the
Subcommittee on Research Animal Care and the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital.
Hypoxic Chambers. Mice were housed in 80-L transparent acrylic boxes. The
desired FiO2 was obtained by mixing a constant flow of medical air with pure
nitrogen from a liquid nitrogen tank (Airgas) or by direct separation of ni-
trogen and oxygen present in room air by a nitrogen generator (MAG-20;
Higher Peak). The total gas flow through the chamber was measured using
a flowmeter (Cole Parmer) and adjusted to 5–10L/min to maintain chamber
CO2 concentrations below 0.4% (CO200; Extech). Soda lime was added to the
chambers as a CO2 scavenger. The oxygen concentration was measured at the
outlet port of the chamber with an O2 sensor (MiniOx 1; Ohio Medical), which
was calibrated weekly using an 8.55% O2 reference tank (Airgas). Oxygen
levels inside the chambers were tolerated within a 0.4% offset from the target
concentration by adjusting nitrogen flow as needed. Temperature was main-
tained at 24–26 °C, and humidity was maintained at 30–70%. A standard light-
dark cycle of ∼12h light exposure was used. Mice were housed in cages with
standard bedding and given unlimited access to food and water.
MRI. MRI scans of the brain were performed with the mice under general
anesthesia with isoflurane 0.5–1.5% in 21% O2. T2-weighted RARE (rapid ac-
quisition of refocused echoes) MRI images were acquired on a 4.7-T small
animal scanner (Pharmascan; Bruker) with a transmit-receive volume coil and
the following parameters: repetition time (TR), 6,000 ms; echo time (TE), 60 ms;
rare factor, 10; 24 slices; 192 × 192 matrix; 0.130 × 0.130 × 0.7 mm voxels; eight
averages. The data were converted from the RAW Bruker format into DICOM
images and visualized with a freeware DICOM reader (Osirix; University
of Geneva).
Cardiac MRI was performed with a 9.4-T horizontal-bore small animal MRI
scanner (Biospec; Bruker) equipped with a 1,500-mT/m gradient system. Images
were acquired with an MRI-compatible cardiorespiratory gating system (SA
Instruments) and a transmit-receive surface coil. Cine imaging was performed
on the short axis of the heart from base to apex with a gradient echo cine
sequence and the following parameters: field of view, 25 × 25 mm2; slice
thickness, 1 mm with no gaps; matrix, 200 × 200; 20 frames per cycle; TR, RR
interval/20; TE, 1 ms; flip angle, 30°; four averages. The data were converted in
MATLAB (Mathworks) into the DICOM format and analyzed with the Osirix
freeware DICOM reader.
Brain Histology. Mice were placed under deep anesthesia with ketamine and
fentanyl, and a needle was inserted into the left ventricle. The whole body
was perfused with ice-cold PBS, followed immediately by 4% PFA. The brain
was removed, stored in 4% PFA for 24–48 h, and then placed in 30% sucrose
(in PBS) for 48 h. Fixed brains were sectioned parasagittally. In addition, two
transverse sections of cerebellum were prepared: a rostral section with
subjacent pons and a more caudal section with medulla oblongata. Immu-
nohistochemistry was performed using an antibody against the microglial
marker Iba-1 (Wako) at 2 μg/mL.
Echocardiography. For LV studies, mice were scanned using a 13-MHz probe
(Vivid 7; GE Healthcare). All scans were performed by an experienced
echocardiographer who was blinded to the study group assignments. During
the procedure, all mice were breathing 21% O2 and were anesthetized
with isoflurane (0.5–1.5%) titrated to maintain a heart rate between
500 and 600 bpm.
Pulmonary Studies. The WD ratio was calculated by dividing the wet lung tissue
weight by the dry lung tissue weight. Organs were left to dry for 24 h at 60 °C to
obtain dry lung tissue. Frozen lung samples were stored at −80 °C, and mye-
loperoxidase activity was assessed as described previously (38). Lungs were
perfused for H&E staining using a wash solution of Ringer’s lactate followed
by 4% PFA. Perfusions were performed during deep anesthesia, followed by
open chest puncture of the cardiac apex using a 20-gauge needle. A 1-mm
incision was made in the right atrium to allow outflow of blood from the
venous return. After 1 min, the lungs were inflated with 4% PFA through the
trachea, allowing 1 min for proper filling of alveoli. A pressure of ∼30 cmH2O
was obtained by gravity flow. Organs were stored overnight in PFA and pro-
cessed on slides by the Histopathology Core at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Behavior. Behavioral experiments were performed using a Rotarod (Ugo
Basile) machine with and acceleration of 5 rpm/min and a maximum speed of
40 rpm. Mice were placed on the accelerating, rotating rod while breathing
room air. Latency to fall was measured up to a maximum time of 300 s. The
test was performed three times, with a minimum of 10 min between sessions
to allow for recovery. The median latency to fall was reported to avoid the
incorporation of aberrant behavior trials. If mice latched onto a rotarod
rather than walking on the rod for more than 10 s, this time was recorded as
the latency to fall.
Biomarker Measurements. Isotope-labeled standards (CDN isotope) of lactate
and α-hydroxybutyrate were used to generate a standard curve. This allowed
for absolute quantification of metabolites in mouse plasma. For this, 30 μL of
the mouse plasma sample was combined with 20 μL of isotope-labeled internal
standard, and 70% acetonitrile was used for metabolite extraction. LC-MS was

Breathing 11% O2 in late-stage neurological disease reverses pathological inflammation in the brains of Ndufs4 KO mice. Representative images with Iba-1
staining of the OB and cerebellum (CB) in KO mice and WT controls (n = 3 per group). Iba-1 is a marker of inflammation in the brain, indicative of microglial
activation. Images demonstrate the reversibility of the neuropathological pattern by breathing 11% O2 at the late stage of disease (55 d). (A) KO mice breathing
21% O2. (B) KO mice breathing 21% O2 up to 55 d and then breathing 11% O2 (to 160 d). MRI-demonstrated reversal of the lesions reported in Fig. 8 was observed
in these same mice. (C) Normoxic WT controls. (D) Hypoxic WT controls.

 performed on a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a
Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Xbridge
amide HILIC column (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.5 μM particle size; Waters, 186006091)
was used for separate tests in the negative ionization mode. Mobile phase A
was 20 mM ammonium acetate and 0.25% ammonium hydroxide (pH 9).
Mobile phase B was 100% acetonitrile. Data acquisition was performed in full
scan mode, selected for a range of 70–1,000 m/z, with resolution of 140,000, an
automatic gain control target of 3e6, and a maximum injection time of 400 ms.
Blood and Tissue Collection. For collection of plasma and tissues, mice were
anesthetized with an i.p. injection of ketamine (120 mg/kg) and fentanyl
(0.09 mg/kg). After tracheostomy, volume-controlled ventilation was main-
tained at a respiratory rate of 90 breaths/min, a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg, a
positive end-expiratory pressure of 1 cmH2O, and an inspired O2 of 21% (Mini
Vent 845; Harvard Apparatus). Whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture
and placed in an EDTA-containing tube. Plasma was obtained by centrifuging
whole blood at 2,000 × g for ∼20 min. Tissues were harvested and immediately
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. When repeat samples were required, a small
tail nick was performed, and blood was collected in heparinized glass capillary
tubes. Blood samples were then centrifuged as described above.
Transcutaneous Awake SpO2 and Arterial Blood Gas Tensions at Various FiO2
Values. Healthy, unanesthetized adult C57Bl6 mice were placed inside a 5-L
chamber, and gas flow was set to maintain chamber CO2 concentration below
0.1% (CO200, Extech). Oxygen concentrations were measured at the cham-
ber inlet and outlet using an O2 analyzer (MiniOx 1). A murine trans-
cutaneous oximeter collar probe was placed on the mice to allow for
unrestrained measurements (MouseOx Plus; Starr Life Sciences). The chamber
FiO2 was adjusted to obtain 11%, 17%, and 21% O2 sequentially. The mice
were allowed to adapt for 5 min at each oxygen level. SpO2 values were
recorded continuously for the next minute and averaged.
For arterial measurements, additional mice were anesthetized with
sevoflurane 3.5%. A PE-10 catheter was used to cannulate the carotid
artery after ligation. Mice were allowed to recover for 1 h after surgery. At
the end of the procedure, mice were placed in a 5-L acrylic chamber that
was constantly ventilated with the desired FiO2. Mice were allowed a
5-min adaptation to each FiO2 level (randomized sequence), after which
heparinized arterial blood was sampled and analyzed with a blood gas
analyzer (ABL800; Radiometer).
Statistics. Data are reported as mean ± SD. Analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. The two-sample Student t test was used for
two-group comparisons. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s correction was
used for multiple comparisons. The log-rank test was performed, and HRs
with 95% CIs were calculated to compare survival rates. A P value < 0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance.
