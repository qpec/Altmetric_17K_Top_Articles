Abstract
Objective
Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host
response to infection. In sepsis and septic shock, pathogen-associated molecular pattern
molecules (PAMPS), such as bacterial exotoxins, cause direct cellular damage and/or trig-
ger an immune response in the host often leading to excessive cytokine production, a mal-
adaptive systemic inflammatory response syndrome response (SIRS), and tissue damage
that releases DAMPs, such as activated complement and HMGB-1, into the bloodstream
causing further organ injury. Cytokine reduction using extracorporeal blood filtration has
been correlated with improvement in survival and clinical outcomes in experimental studies
and clinical reports, but the ability of this technology to reduce a broader range of inflamma-
tory mediators has not been well-described. This study quantifies the size-selective adsorp-
tion of a wide range of sepsis-related inflammatory bacterial and fungal PAMPs, DAMPs
and cytokines, in a single compartment, in vitro whole blood recirculation system.
Measurements and main results
Purified proteins were added to whole blood at clinically relevant concentrations and recircu-
lated through a device filled with CytoSorb® hemoadsorbent polymer beads (CytoSorbents
Corporation, USA) or control (no bead) device in vitro. Except for the TNF-α trimer, hemoad-
sorption through porous polymer bead devices reduced the levels of a broad spectrum of
cytokines, DAMPS, PAMPS and mycotoxins by more than 50 percent.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that CytoSorb® hemoadsorbent polymer beads efficiently remove
a broad spectrum of toxic PAMPS and DAMPS from blood providing an additional means of
reducing the uncontrolled inflammatory cascade that contributes to a maladaptive SIRS
response, organ dysfunction and death in patients with a broad range of life-threatening

 inflammatory conditions such as sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, and
other severe inflammatory conditions.
Introduction
Sepsis has been defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host
response to infection [1]. Numerous factors contribute to this dysregulation, including pro-
inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) such as bacterial exotoxins and endotoxins, mycotoxins, damage-associated molecu-
lar patterns (DAMPs) released by injured cells, and host-specific factors such as activated com-
plement and procalcitonin. Complex interactions involving such substances can lead to severe
immune system dysfunction ranging from a destructive maladaptive systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS) to advanced immunosuppression.
PAMPs often trigger the initial sepsis cascade, evoking both innate and cell-mediated
immune responses. Inflammation from upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, activated
complement, and other mediators, coupled with direct PAMP-induced injury to cells, can
release DAMPs. This broad class of endogenous molecules is normally found only intracellu-
larly. Once released into the bloodstream [2], however, DAMPs, like PAMPs, trigger immune
responses through pattern recognition receptors [3]. Persistent circulating DAMP elevations
contribute to organ injury [4] and identify those patients at highest risk of multiple organ dys-
function syndrome and death in community-acquired pneumonia and sepsis [5].
The foregoing observations suggest that removing not only cytokines, but PAMPs, DAMPs,
and other inflammatory mediators from blood may modulate systemic inflammation during
sepsis, prevent or treat organ failure, and improve patient outcomes. A sorbent technology
developed to effect such removal is CytoSorb1 (CS; CytoSorbents Corporation, Monmouth
Jct., NJ), an extracorporeal cytokine adsorber composed of highly porous poly(styrene-co-divi-
nylbenzene) hemoadsorbent beads. Via a combination of size exclusion and hydrophobic
interactions, the device adsorbs proteins and other substances within a 10–60 kDa molecular
weight range leading to the hypothesis that the device could also adsorb PAMPs, DAMPs, and
toxins [6, 7]. While case reports have described positive outcomes with CytoSorb use as a cyto-
kine adsorber in septic shock [8–17], toxic shock [18], necrotizing fasciitis [10], cardiac surgery
[19, 20], and liver failure [21, 22], investigation into removal of inflammatory mediators other
than cytokines has been limited. Thus, this study was performed to quantify the ability of CS
polymer beads to adsorb a broad selection of PAMPs, DAMPs and mycotoxins, as well as cyto-
kines, from whole blood in a single-compartment, in vitro recirculation system.
Materials and methods
Studied analytes
These experiments examined the hemoadsorption profiles of four cytokines, four DAMPs,
three PAMPs, and two mycotoxins. These factors were selected for evaluation because they are
frequently present at high levels, and have been associated with detrimental effects, in septic
patients.
The studied DAMPs included high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) [23], procalcitonin
[24], S100 protein [25], and C5a [26]. Extracellular HMGB-1 is an indicator of tissue necrosis
and has been associated with increased risk of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome
after blunt chest trauma [23]. Procalcitonin is involved in tissue transmigration and monocyte

 activation [24]. S100A8 and S100A9 homodimers and heterodimers bind to and signal directly
via the toll-like receptor 4/lipopolysaccharide receptor complex, with S100A8 as the active
component [25]. The complement system forms part of the host defense against pathogens,
but excessive levels of C5a and other activated factors can cause tissue injury and adverse out-
comes in sepsis [26].
The PAMPs studied comprised Staphylococcus α-toxin (α-hemolysin), toxic shock syn-
drome toxin-1 (TSST-1), and Streptococcus pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB). Such bacterial exo-
toxins are potent mediators of both direct and indirect injury to the host, but their role is often
overlooked. α-hemolysin, a key virulence factor produced by most Staphylococcus aureus iso-
lates, forms pores in cell membranes and causes rapid tissue destruction [27]. TSST-1, a super-
antigen, non-specifically activates T-cells, resulting in hyperactivation of the immune response
and excessive cytokine release [28]. SpeB, a virulence factor synthesized by Streptococcus pyo-
genes, inhibits phagocytic activity by cleaving and degrading host immunoglobulin and acti-
vated complement components [29].
The studied mycotoxins, aflatoxin and trichothecene T-2 toxin, are typical low-molecular
weight (<1kDa) products of disseminated fungal infections that often arise at sites of previous
or concomitant bacterial infection. These substances can suppress humoral and cellular immu-
nity, trigger cell death and apoptosis, and promote tissue breakdown, resulting in organ failure,
e.g., acute hepatic failure [30, 31].
In vitro recirculation system and quantification of protein removal
The solution-depletion method [32] was used to quantify protein removal in this study because
it enables a well-controlled simulation of the sorbent’s potential ability to remove factors from
the vascular compartment without the complexity of refill from extravascular spaces or de
novo synthesis, helping to establish a baseline reference for animal or clinical studies. In brief,
purified inflammatory proteins were added to 3.8% citrated whole bovine blood (Lampire Bio-
logical Laboratories, Pipersville, PA; AAALAC accreditation #001032, USDA #23-R-0122,
23-B-0020 and NIH Office of Lab Animal Welfare OLAW #A3997-01) at typical clinical con-
centrations. The proteins were recirculated with a peristaltic pump through a CS polymer-
filled device or control (no bead) device for five hours. The blood volume to polymer ratio was
maintained at 13:3 for all size devices to reflect the clinical treatment of an adult patient with
the 300 mL device. Typical flow rates for the 300 mL device in clinical use range from 150–500
mL/min, meaning that blood turnover can range from every 8 minutes to every 26 minutes.
Purified recombinant cytokines (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO): MIP1-α at 400 pg/mL, IL-6 at
3000 pg/mL, IFN-γ at 400 pg/mL, and TNF-α at 800 pg/mL, were added together into 927 mL
of bovine blood and recirculated through a 70 mL polymer-filled device or control device at
140 mL/min for five hours. Due to more limited availability of materials, purified recombinant
DAMP and PAMP proteins were individually spiked into 265 mL of bovine blood and recircu-
lated through a 20 mL device at a flow rate of 40 mL/min. Initial concentrations were: HMGB-
1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 100 ng/mL [23], S100A8 (ACROBiosystems, Newark,
DE) at 50 ng/mL [25], complement C5a (R&D Systems) at 25 ng/mL [26], procalcitonin
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 16 ng/mL [24], TSST-1 (Toxin Technology, Inc., Sarasota, FL) at 2 μg/mL
[33], SpeB (Toxin Technology) at 100 ng/mL [28]. A 10 mL device at a flow rate of 20 mL/min
in a blood volume of 133 mL was used for the mycotoxin recirculation experiments. The initial
concentrations of Aspergillus flavus aflatoxin B1 (Sigma-Aldrich) was 10 μg/mL [34] and T-2
toxin (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) were 10 μg/mL [35]. Plasma was prepared and
ELISA was performed following manufacturer instructions (cytokines, S100, and C5a, duosets

 bacterial toxins (Toxin Technology); and aflatoxin (Helica BiosystemsInc., Santa Ana, CA).
Due to the presence of anti-hemolysin antibodies in blood obtained from adult bovine donors,
fetal bovine serum (90 mL) was used for the α-hemolysin (Toxin Technology) recirculation
experiment (1.5μg/mL with a 10 mL polymer device). α-hemolysin was quantitated by ELISA
(Neogen Corp., Lansing, MI). Further details of the protocols can be found at: http://dx.doi.

Statistics
Data are described as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) for the percent changes versus
baseline values (t = 0). Differences among groups were compared using two-way ANOVA. Sta-
tistical significance of individual time points between control and CS devices was determined
by multiple t-tests using the Holm-Sidak method with alpha = 5.000%. Each time point was
individually analyzed without assuming a consistent standard deviation. Significant differences
were regarded as p<0.05. All statistical analyses were performed with the aid of GraphPad
PRISM1.
Results
Hemoperfusion of whole blood through CS polymer bead devices for five hours reduced the
levels of cytokines MIP1-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ by 98±4.0%, 91±3.0%, and 82±15%, respectively
(Fig 1). TNF-α removal was not as efficient, reaching only 41±4.4% by 5 hours. The CS device

 removed 83%-98% of DAMPS C5a, HMGB-1, procalcitonin, and S100-A8 (Fig 2) and bacte-
rial PAMPS α-toxin, SpeB, and TSST-1 (Fig 3). Removal of aflatoxin and T-2 toxin was partic-
ularly efficient, achieving levels of over 95% and 99%, respectively, within 2 hours (Fig 4). In
contrast, levels of all the inflammatory mediators tested remained fairly constant in recircula-
tion experiments with a control device (Figs 1–4).
Removal efficiency correlated with the size of the analyte (S1 Fig). The CS polymer device
removed over 90% of the small toxins, such as aflatoxin (0.3 kDa) and T-2 toxin (0.5 kDa), and
proteins 20 kDa or less, MIP1-α (8 kDa), C5a (8.2 kDa), procalcitonin (13 kDa), and S100A8
(20 kDa) The adsorption of proteins between 20 and 50 kDa, such as IL-6 (26 kDa), IFN-γ (25
kDa), HMGB-1 (25 kDa), TSST-1 (24 kDa), α-toxin (33 kDa) and SPE B (40 kDa), was more
variable, demonstrating 79%-97% removal, with 41% of the 52 kDa TNF-α adsorbed (S1 File).
Discussion
Sepsis is a highly heterogeneous disease with severity and progression of illness dependent
upon a myriad of interacting factors. These factors [36] include, for example, the microbial
insult, which may be of bacterial (gram-positive and gram-negative), viral, or fungal origin;
the pathogen load; expression of virulence factors; host factors such as age, genetic characteris-
tics, and comorbidities; the site of infection; and the elapsed time since the initial infection.
This complexity creates a highly dynamic and unstable situation that has so far confounded

 therapeutic efforts targeted against single factors. This complexity is also what has driven inter-
est in broad-spectrum blood purification strategies to treat sepsis by reducing a wide range of
PAMPs and DAMPs, correcting the imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
factors, and re-establishing immune homeostasis. When efficacious, and used with antibiotics,
broad-spectrum blood purification therapies could lead to a more comprehensive and
improved approach to sepsis.
Recognition of the multitude of damaging roles played by these soluble mediators has over
the past few decades led to the evolving application of broad-spectrum extracorporeal blood
purification techniques to remove excessive inflammatory mediators and toxins in sepsis and
related conditions [36–38]. However, the effectiveness of such modalities generally has been
poor and constrained by the technologies used. For example, standard hemodialysis, hemodia-
filtration, and hemofiltration have demonstrated only limited removal of a broad range of
cytokines and inflammatory toxins [38, 39]. Initial enthusiasm for high-volume hemofiltration
(HVHF) for this purpose has dissipated due to the significant costs associated with the
required large volumes of ultrapure replacement solution, the risk of severe electrolyte distur-
bances, and the lack of hemodynamic or survival benefits [40]. Although high-molecular
weight cut-off filters have shown some promise in sepsis and related disorders [41, 42], numer-
ous questions remain unanswered regarding the timing, duration, and frequency of adminis-
tration and the optimal membrane characteristics (molecular weight cut-off, surface area,
composition). The “High Cut-Off Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis In Septic Patients
Treated For Acute Renal Failure After Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome/Septic
Shock” study [43] was terminated early, after an interim analysis showed no difference in
28-day mortality, vasopressor use, duration of mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit
length-of-stay in hemodialysed patients versus controls.
Unlike membrane-based technologies that work by diffusion or convection, hemoadsorp-
tive devices are filled with sorbent materials that have much greater surface area. These materi-
als can adsorb substances from blood based on affinity, ionic interaction, polarity, or other
surface adsorptive mechanisms. A hemoadsorptive device containing polyester fibers bound
to polymyxin B has been applied to remove lipopolysaccharide endotoxin found in gram-nega-
tive infections [44, 45]. Mixed results have been seen in clinical studies, possibly because of the
small window for intervention before immune response activation.
Using another hemoadsorptive technology, CS porous polymer beads, this report demon-
strates in an in vitro system the reduction of a broad range of toxic PAMPs, DAMPs and myco-
toxins from whole blood. Such reduction relies on a combination of pore capture and surface
adsorption, without use of biological ligands. The defined porous structure of the CS beads
contributes to selectivity by limiting adsorption of substances greater than approximately 65
kDa, such as albumin [46] and immunoglobulins (>150 kDa) [20]. Proteins in the approxi-
mate range of 10–60 kDa fit inside the pores where they adsorb onto the internal polymer sur-
face. Surface adsorption by the hydrophobic CS polymer, through a combination of non-polar
interactions, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces [32], further discriminates in favor
of removing hydrophobic substances over hydrophilic ones. This mechanism is primarily
what governs CS adsorption of detrimental small molecules such as mycotoxins, antibiotics, or
β2-microglobulin [47, 48] as well as beneficial molecules such as Vitamin B12 [S2 Fig]. Finally,
in vitro investigations indicate that the degree of adsorption of a given protein in a mixed solu-
tion of proteins relates linearly to that protein’s relative concentration in the solution, i.e.,
there is greater adsorption at high concentrations, and less adsorption at low concentrations
[49, 50]. This observation suggests that in the blood of patients with sepsis, the low concentra-
tions of non-target substances relative to the elevated levels of target substances, potentially

 might limit the removal of the former by the adsorbent CS beads. Such a mechanism might
serve to minimize the risk of overtreatment.
The ability to remove a broad range of PAMPs and DAMPs supports several presumed
mechanisms by which blood purification with the CytoSorb1 adsorber may help to stabilize
critically-ill sepsis patients. A first, direct mechanism would be reduction in levels of mycotox-
ins, bacterial exotoxins, and other PAMPs that cause direct tissue injury and/or lead to hyper-
activation of the immune response and SIRS. Secondly, such a reduction in inflammatory
mediators could lead to diminished levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can contribute
to direct tissue injury and organ dysfunction, e.g., cell apoptosis, endothelial injury, capillary
leak syndrome, and SIRS [2, 3]. Thirdly, the resultant decrease in the “noise” of circulating
cytokines could “boost the signal” of cytokines in infected tissue. Thereby, activated leukocytes
would be re-directed to the actual site of infection, improving source control while decreasing
the risk of leukocyte-mediated injury to non-infected organs [51, 52]. Lastly, in settings of bac-
terial/fungal co-infection such as invasive pulmonary disease [31], PAMP removal might
diminish, or avoid induction of, mycotoxin production and any resultant increase in fungal
virulence [31]. A combination of these mechanisms may underlie the amelioration of disease
by the adsorber in patients with sepsis and related conditions, e.g., toxic shock syndrome and
necrotizing fasciitis [4–6, 12–15].
We acknowledge that these experiments have significant limitations, including being per-
formed in an in vitro hemoperfusion system with non-septic blood, without a natural refill rate
to challenge the CS device. A randomized controlled study [46] of CytoSorb use in mechani-
cally-ventilated septic patients found no difference in systemic levels of IL-6 between patients
receiving treatment with the hemoadsorption device as compared to standard of care, despite
demonstration of median IL-6 elimination rates of 5%-18% per pass of blood through the
device. This observation is thought to be due to cytokines shifting from the interstitium into
the bloodstream as described by the cytokinetic theory [38, 52, 53]. Another limitation of the
in vitro nature of our study was an inability to correlate PAMP and DAMP removal with anti-
inflammatory effect or other clinical benefit, or to answer clinical questions such as optimal
timing of CS therapy. Further clinical studies are warranted to elucidate these relationships
and issues in patients with sepsis and related conditions.
