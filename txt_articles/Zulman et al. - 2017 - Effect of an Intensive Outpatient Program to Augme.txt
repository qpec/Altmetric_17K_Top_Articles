IMPORTANCE Many organizations are adopting intensive outpatient care programs for
high-need patients, yet little is known about their effectiveness in integrated systems with
established patient-centered medical homes.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate how augmenting the Veterans Affairs (VA) medical home (Patient
Aligned Care Teams [PACT]) with an Intensive Management program (ImPACT) influences
high-need patients’ costs, health care utilization, and experience.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial at a single VA facility. Among
583 eligible high-need outpatients whose health care costs or hospitalization risk were in the
top 5% for the facility, 150 were randomly selected for ImPACT; the remaining 433 received
standard PACT care.
INTERVENTIONS The ImPACT multidisciplinary team addressed health care needs and quality
of life through comprehensive patient assessments, intensive case management, care
coordination, and social and recreational services.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary difference-in-difference analyses examined
changes in health care costs and acute and extended care utilization over a 16-month baseline
and 17-month follow-up period. Secondary analyses estimated the intervention’s effect on
ImPACT participants (using randomization as an instrument) and for patients with key
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. ImPACT participants’ satisfaction and
activation levels were assessed using responses to quality improvement surveys
administered at baseline and 6 months.
RESULTS Of 140 patients assigned to ImPACT, 96 (69%) engaged in the program (mean [SD]
age, 68.3 [14.2] years; 89 [93%] male; mean [SD] number of chronic conditions, 10 [4];
62 [65%] had a mental health diagnosis; 21 [22%] had a history of homelessness). After
accounting for program costs, adjusted person-level monthly health care expenditures
decreased similarly for ImPACT and PACT patients (difference-in-difference [SE] −$101
[$623]), as did acute and extended care utilization rates. Among respondents to the ImPACT
follow-up survey (n = 54 [56% response rate]), 52 (96%) reported that they would
recommend the program to others, and pre-post analyses revealed modest increases in
satisfaction with VA care (mean [SD] increased from 2.90 [0.72] to 3.16 [0.60]; P = .04) and
communication (mean [SD] increased from 2.99 [0.74] to 3.18 [0.60]; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intensive outpatient care for high-need patients did not
reduce acute care utilization or costs compared with standard VA care, although there were
positive effects on experience among patients who participated. Implementing intensive
outpatient care programs in integrated settings with well-established medical homes may not
prevent hospitalizations or achieve substantial cost savings.

W
ithin the United States and many of its component
health c are systems, a small number of
high-need patients—sometimes referred to as
superutilizers1(p1)—account for approximately half of health
care spending.2,3(p1)4-6 Many of these individuals experience
multiple health issues and social stressors that complicate
their health care navigation and self-management. In
response to escalating health care costs, insurers, clinicians,
and health care facilities are eager to identify interventions
that address these patients’health risks and reduce poten-
tially avoidable costly service use.7
Intensive outpatient care programs have gained traction
in recent years as a model for delivering comprehensive, in-
dividualized medical, mental health, and social services
to high-need patients.1,8-11 Despite enthusiasm for these
programs,12 evidence regarding their effects on hospitaliza-
tion and costs is mixed.13,14 Some have described program sav-
ings as high as 15% to 50% in observational and retrospective
evaluations,15-18 and there are examples of programs for older
adults that have decreased acute care use and/or costs in ran-
domizedtrials.19-22However,rigorousevaluationsofotherpro-
gramshavenotdemonstratedtheseeffects,23-25suggestingthat
contextual factors such as patient population, existing ser-
vices, and resource availability may be important.
Because many early intensive outpatient programs were
designed specifically for older adults,19-22 patients in frag-
mented safety net settings,11,13 and employed individuals,17,18
their evaluations may not be generalizable to integrated sys-
tems caring for more diverse populations. Furthermore, it is
unclear whether individuals receiving comprehensive care in
aneffectivepatient-centeredmedicalhome(PCMH)26willben-
efit from additional intensive services.
To advance understanding of the value of intensive out-
patient care in these settings, we evaluated a program in the
Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System, an integrated sys-
tem with a well-established PCMH. The program was a qual-
ity improvement initiative offered to a random sample of pa-
tients with high health care costs and/or hospitalization risk.
In this article, we describe the program’
s effects on health care
utilization, cost, and patient experience.
Methods
Setting and Intervention
Patients in the VA receive primary care through Patient
Aligned Care Teams (PACTs), teamlets with a primary care
clinician, nurse, clinical associate, and administrative asso-
ciate that are supported by social work, pharmacy, and
behavioral health services.27 In February 2013, the VA Palo
Alto facility launched an Intensive Management PACT (Im-
PACT) quality improvement initiative to augment PACT pri-
mary care for high-need patients. ImPACT’
s design
incorporated elements from early intensive outpatient care
programs15-17,23,24,28-33 and lessons from the Medicare Coor-
dinated Care Demonstration.34 The program’
s development
and implementation have been described previously35,36;
core elements are presented in the Box.
TheStanfordUniversityInstitutionalReviewBoardandVA

evaluation of the ImPACT program using deidentified data. In-
formed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of
the study. The ImPACT program was retrospectively regis-
tered on October 6, 2016 (NCT02932228) (protocol in
Supplement 1).
Patient Population
Patients were eligible for ImPACT if they received care from 1
of 14 primary care clinicians and if their total VA health care
costs were in the top 5% for the facility during a 9-month eli-
gibilityphase(October1,2011,throughJune30,2012)oriftheir
risk for 1-year hospitalization in November 2012 was in the top

Question Does an intensive outpatient program for high-need
patients change utilization patterns and reduce costs in an
integrated setting with a patient-centered medical home?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of a Veterans Affairs
intensive outpatient care program, the intervention was well
received by a random sample of high-risk and high-cost patients
but achieved reductions in hospitalization rates and costs similar
to those of usual Veterans Affairs primary care.
Meaning Implementing intensive outpatient care programs in
integrated settings with well-established medical homes may not
prevent hospitalizations or achieve substantial cost savings.

the VA’
s mental health intensive case management, home-
based primary care, or palliative care programs, or if they were
inaninpatientsettingformorethanhalfoftheeligibilityphase.
Patients were also excluded if they were in the lowest cost
decile or the lowest risk quartile in an effort to focus on pa-
tients who were actively high utilizers and at risk for persis-
tent high utilization. Given limited resources, facility leader-
ship offered ImPACT to 150 of the 583 eligible patients (using
simple random sampling without replacement). This number
wasderivedfromcaseloadsreportedbypreviousintensiveout-
patient programs.11,13 ImPACT contacted selected patients by
mail followed by telephone during an enrollment period from
February 1, 2013, through August 31, 2013. The remaining 433
patients received standard PACT care (Figure 1).
Data Sources and Measures
We examined health care costs and utilization among
ImPACT and PACT patients during a 16-month baseline pe-
riod (October 1, 2011, through January 31, 2013) and 17-month
follow-up period (February 1, 2013, through June 30, 2014). We
obtained sociodemographic, clinical, utilization, and cost data
from VA Palo Alto’
s Decision Support System office, and Care
Assessment Need risk scores37 from the VA’
s Regional Data
Warehouse. We obtained patient insurance status, mortality
data, and cost and utilization data for VA-reimbursed care out-
side the facility (fee-basis services) from VA Palo Alto’
s Office
of Business Analytics. Mortality data were updated on Sep-
tember 15, 2014, and validated April 16, 2015, through medi-
cal record review for patients identified as deceased and pa-
tients with VA costs of $0 for 2 consecutive months at the end
of the evaluation period (n = 153).
We identified chronic condition diagnoses using Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes
that were documented at least once in inpatient or outpatient
encounters, using an established VA algorithm.38(pp89-92) So-
ciodemographicandotherpatientcharacteristicsincludedage,
sex, urban/rural geographical location, race/ethnicity, non-VA
health insurance, and history of homelessness (identified
through the ICD-9 code 60.0, a method that could underesti-
mate actual rates due to underdetection and undercoding39).
Our primary outcome was total cost of VA care (including
inpatient, outpatient, and fee-basis care). We also examined
costs of specific inpatient services (ie, acute and extended
medical/surgical care and acute and extended mental health/
residential care), and outpatient services (ie, emergency de-
partment [ED], primary, specialty, and mental health care). For
primary analyses, we included mean monthly ImPACT en-
counter costs (approximately $136/patient) to capture person-
nel effort and workload; in sensitivity analyses we replaced en-
counter costs with mean monthly ImPACT personnel costs
($240/patient) to reflect program costs incurred by the facil-
ity. Utilization measures included hospitalization frequency
and length of stay for each inpatient service, and number of
primary, mental health, specialty care, and ED visits.
Patient experience outcomes derived from a quality
improvement survey administered to ImPACT patients at
baseline and 6 months after enrollment. Survey measures
included the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18)
(5-point subscales for general satisfaction, accessibility/

convenience, and communication, modified to refer specifi-
cally to VA care)40 and the 6-item low-literacy Patient Activa-
tion Measure (PAM-6) (standardized to 100 points).41 The
follow-up survey also asked about patients’satisfaction with
ImPACT services and their likelihood to recommend the pro-
gram to others.
Analyses
The original evaluation design assumed that program sustain-
ability would require demonstration of superiority under
1-tailed testing; however, for the final evaluation we used a
more conservative 2-tailed test. Power from the 1-tailed and
2-tailed calculations for an analysis of covariance to detect a
20% reduction in mean costs (comparable to savings achieved
by previous intensive outpatient programs over 12-18
months)16-18 was 88.6% and 81.3%, respectively, equivalent to
asuperioritymarginof8.5%and6.2%reductioninmeancosts,
respectively.
We excluded from analyses patients who died or left the
facility before the intervention start date (February 1, 2013) (8
in ImPACT, 23 in PACT) and patients who were identified in
retrospective medical record review as not meeting study eli-
gibility criteria (2 in ImPACT, 5 in PACT). This resulted in a fi-
nal study population of 140 patients in ImPACT and 405 pa-
tients in PACT.
We compared characteristics of patients in ImPACT and
PACT using t tests for continuous variables and χ2 tests for di-
chotomous and categorical variables. We examined differ-
ences in attrition (ie, departure from the health care facility)
across the 2 groups using linear regression. We examined dif-
ferences in mortality, including among patients who had left
the facility, using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Baseline and fol-
low-up utilization and cost data were available for all pa-
tients. In descriptive analyses, we examined changes in mean
ImPACT vs PACT person-level aggregate costs and utilization
over 16-month baseline and follow-up periods.
We performed intention-to-treat analyses within a differ-
ence-in-differences (D-in-D) framework to compare monthly
VA health care costs and utilization among ImPACT and PACT
patients, during baseline and follow-up periods.42,43 We in-
cluded fixed effects to account for fixed differences across
patients.44 In sensitivity analyses, we replaced person fixed
effects with covariates for baseline characteristics and found
similar results. For patients who died during the study pe-
riod, we included monthly costs after death ($0); for patients
who left the facility, we set monthly costs to missing after they
were no longer receiving care from the VA facility. In second-
ary analyses, we estimated the effect of the intervention on
patients who actively engaged in ImPACT (defined a priori as
completing an intake and at least 3 additional encounters
with the team) using randomization as an instrument for
participation.45-47
We conducted prespecified and post hoc exploratory
analyses to examine variation in program effects for key
patient subgroups, with the goal of refining the program’
s
future patient selection criteria. Prespecified subgroups
included patients with and without mental health diagno-
ses, patients younger than 65 years and 65 years or older,
and patients who were eligible for ImPACT based on high
cost vs high risk for hospitalization (non–mutually exclusive
groups). Post hoc stratified analyses focused on characteris-
tics that the clinical team perceived as potential candidates
for future patient selection: the presence of heart failure,
diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; hospi-
talization in the 6 months prior to program implementation;
and high risk for hospitalization with a hospitalization in the
6 months prior to program implementation.
To evaluate patient experience, we used paired t tests to
assess changes in mean (SD) scores for satisfaction (PSQ-18)
subscales40 and activation (PAM-6)41 among ImPACT partici-
pants who completed both the baseline and follow-up sur-
veys. We examined potential nonresponse bias by comparing
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics among pa-
tients who completed the baseline survey alone, and patients
who completed the baseline and follow-up surveys.
We used Stata 13.0 to perform all analyses.
Results
ImPACT and PACT patients’baseline sociodemographic and
clinical characteristics were similar (Table 1 and eTable 1 in
Supplement 2). ImPACT patients’ chronic conditions in-
cluded hypertension (100 [71%]), joint disorders (80 [57%]),
depression (68 [49%]), coronary artery disease (51 [36%]), dia-
betes (47 [34%]), drug use disorder (41 [29%]), heart failure (34
[24%]), posttraumatic stress disorder (32 [23%]), and cancer
(29[21%]),allofwhichwerepresentincomparableratesamong
PACT patients. Among the 39 chronic conditions assessed, the
only condition with significantly different rates among Im-
PACT and PACT patients was dementia (13 [9%] vs 17 [4%], re-
spectively; P = .02) (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Of the 140 ImPACT patients included in intention-to-
treat analyses, 96 (69%) engaged in the program (ie, they com-
pleted an intake and had at least 3 additional encounters with
the team) (Figure 1). Engaged vs nonengaged ImPACT pa-
tients were typically older (mean [SD] age, 68.3 [14.2] vs 62.1
[12.6] years; P = .01), were more likely to have non-VA health
insurance (primarily Medicare) (57 [59%] vs 17 [39%]; P = .02),
and were less likely to live in a rural location (4 [4%] vs 7 [16%];
P = .04), respectively. Engaged patients had lower rates of liver
disease/hepatitis C (16 [17%] vs 14 [32%]; P = .04) and alcohol
use disorders (16 [17%] vs 14 [32%]; P = .04) than nonen-
gaged patients, respectively, but otherwise had similar rates
of chronic conditions (eTables 1 and 2 in Supplement 2).
Patient Experience Outcomes
Among ImPACT particpants who responded to the
follow-up survey (n = 54 [56% response rate among
engaged patients]), 52 (96%) reported that they would rec-
ommend the program to others. A majority reported being
“extremely satisfied” with the program’
s medical care (28 of
40 [70%]), social work (22 of 29 [76%]), and recreation
therapy and community services (25 of 32 [78%]). Among
those who responded to baseline and follow-up surveys
(n = 54, 56% response rate among engaged patients), there

Clinical and Utilization Outcomes
Mortality rates were 12.1% (n = 17) and 13.6% (n = 55) for
ImPACT and PACT patients, respectively (mortality rate dif-
ference = 1.4% [95% CI, −5.7% to 7.3%]; log-rank test for equal-
ity of survival functions P = .69) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2),
attrition rates due to patients leaving the facility were 8.6%
(n = 12)and5.4%(n = 22),respectively(P = .19).Duringthefirst
16 months of the intervention period, the mean (SD) number
of primary care visits (including ImPACT encounters) was 21.8
(17.4) for ImPACT patients and 7.4 (7.5) for PACT patients
(Table 2). ImPACT and PACT patients’mean (SD) numbers of
acute medical/surgical hospitalizations were comparable at
baseline (1.3 [1.5]) and decreased at similar rates to 0.7 (1.2) for
patients in ImPACT and PACT (monthly admission D-in-D [SE]
= 0.01 [0.01]). Mean (SD) ED visits also decreased at similar
rates, from 3.4 (3.3) to 2.1 (2.9) among ImPACT patients, and
from 3.3 (3.3) to 2.1 (2.9) among PACT patients (monthly ED
visitD-in-D[SE] = −0.01[0.02]).Therewerenosignificantpro-

After accounting for ImPACT encounter costs, mean baseline
and follow-up person-level monthly costs declined at similar
ratesamongImPACTpatients(21.0%,from$6139to$4850)and
PACT patients (20.7%, from $5821 to $4618) (Figure 2 and eFig-

ses, ImPACT did not have a significant effect on monthly costs
(D-in-D [SE] = −$101 [$623]). The D-in-D estimate was further
attenuated when ImPACT personnel monthly costs (approxi-
mately $240/patient) were substituted for ImPACT encoun-
ter monthly costs (approximately $136/patient) in sensitivity
analyses. Stratified cost analyses revealed no statistically sig-
nificant differences among subgroups, although nonsignifi-
cantly greater cost reductions were observed for patients
younger than 65 years, patients hospitalized in the 6 months
prior to enrollment, and those with certain medical condi-
tions (Figure 3).
ImPACT was associated with a significant increase in
monthly person-level primary care costs (independent of Im-
PACTencountercosts)(D-in-D[SE] = $30[$14]),buttherewere
no effects on costs associated with other outpatient or inpa-
tient services (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). Secondary analy-
ses accounting for active engagement in the intervention re-
vealed similar patterns (eTable 5 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
The ImPACT program provided an opportunity to evaluate in-
tensive outpatient care for high-need patients in an inte-
grated system with an established PCMH. Findings from this

evaluation have import for accountable care organizations and
other clinical settings that are responsible for their high-risk
patients’outcomes and associated costs.7 Contrary to expec-
tations, the program did not reduce acute care utilization or
total expenditures compared with standard PCMH care, al-
though high satisfaction rates suggest that the program may
have enhanced patients’experiences with their care.
This randomized clinical trial adds to a growing body of
literature describing intensive outpatient care programs for
high-need patients.11,13,14 Previous reports of cost reductions
after patients enroll in these programs may stem from their ob-
servational nature.13-18 The substantial and comparable cost
declines observed among ImPACT and PACT patients illus-
trate regression to the mean experienced by high-cost popu-
lations, and underscore the importance of rigorous evalua-
tions of programs for these patients.

before the evaluation began.22 Once patients are enrolled in
such programs, it takes time to build their trust, modify health

This figure presents adjusted difference-in-difference estimates for the ImPACT
program's effects on monthly person-level costs. Estimates are presented for
the intention-to-treat population, and for subgroups of patients with key
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics at baseline. The
difference-in-differences estimate corresponds to the change in monthly costs
among patients in ImPACT, minus the change in costs for patients in PACT.
A negative program effect corresponds to a larger decline in costs over the
study period among patients in ImPACT, compared with patients in PACT.
Changes in monthly costs were estimated using linear regression, controlling for
patient fixed effects. If patients died or left the facility, their costs were set to 0
and missing, respectively, for subsequent months. The gray bars and error bars
represent difference-in-difference estimates and standard errors, respectively,
for ImPACT's effects on monthly person-level costs.

behaviors (including activation), and improve chronic dis-
ease trajectories. ImPACT patients had nearly 3 times more vis-
its to primary care compared with PACT patients, which could
potentially translate to increased health maintenance and
screening, and reductions in future utilization.
Our findings could also reflect a mismatch between
ImPACT’
s selected patients and the program’
s disciplines
and services. Participants in a Super-Utilizers Summit in
2013 concluded that the “holy grail” for intensive outpatient
programs is to determine “which patients need which inter-
ventions in which setting by which provider.”1(p6) ImPACT
patients were selected based on their cost and future hospi-
talization risk; however, recent hospitalization was associ-
ated with a nonsignificant greater effect in subgroup analy-
ses (Figure 3). This and other indicators of acuity (such as
clinician referral) have been used to select patients for other
programs and may improve identification of individuals
with modifiable risk factors.48
In addition, while ImPACT’
s nurse practitioner and social
worker were well equipped to manage medical and social
needs, the program did not have a designated mental health
clinician, and instead referred patients to the VA’
s existing,
comprehensive mental health services. This referral-based
model may not have been adequate given the prevalence and
acuity of ImPACT patients’mental health and substance use
disorders. Future programs for similar populations may ben-
efit from including a mental health clinician and/or special-
ized mental health–focused interventions.49
Finally, ImPACT may have increased service use and costs
incertaincircumstancesbyuncoveringunmetmedicalormen-
tal health needs, and facilitating appropriate access to special-
ists and acute care services. Subgroup analyses, while under-
powered to detect a statistically significant effect, suggest that
olderadultsinImPACTexperiencedincreasedcosts.Thiscould
be due to ImPACT-eligible older adults shifting their care from
Medicare-coverednon-VAservicestotheVA,andwarrantsfur-
ther investigation once Medicare claims data are available.
Limitations
Severallimitationsshouldbenoted.Generalizabilityoffindings

effects may have been diluted because the evaluation began at
program implementation, and it took 7 months to enroll all en-
gaged patients. Furthermore, because of unanticipated delays
in program initiation, some patients left the facility or died be-
fore the program began, reducing statistical power to 79% (see
Methods).Weattemptedtoaddressthispostrandomization,pre-
intervention dropout by conducting D-in-D analyses.
In addition, because ImPACT and PACT teams were co-
located, PACT clinicians could have observed and adopted
ImPACT interventions; however, they would not have had the
advantage of ImPACT personnel and time, and contamina-
tion was not noted during the implementation evaluation.36
Finally, assessment of patient experience outcomes was based
on a quality improvement survey of ImPACT patients (with no
comparison group and a 63% response rate) and could be bi-
ased if follow-up survey completion was correlated with posi-
tive or negative experience.
Conclusions
Intensive outpatient care for randomly selected high-need pa-
tients did not reduce acute care utilization or costs when com-
pared with standard PCMH care in the VA’
s integrated sys-
tem. Findings highlight the need to consider study design and
contextwheninterpretingevidenceabouttheseprograms.Ad-
ditionalresearchshouldexplorewhetherthevalueofsuchpro-
grams can be enhanced through modifying patient selection
criteria, team structure, or patient engagement strategies.
While high-need patients might benefit from intensive out-
patient interventions in some settings, programs in inte-
grated systems with well-established medical homes may not
achieve substantial cost savings.
