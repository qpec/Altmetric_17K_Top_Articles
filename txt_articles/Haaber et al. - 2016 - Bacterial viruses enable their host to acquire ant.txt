Prophages are quiescent viruses located in the chromosomes of bacteria. In the human
pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, prophages are omnipresent and are believed to be respon-
sible for the spread of some antibiotic resistance genes. Here we demonstrate that release of
phages from a subpopulation of S. aureus cells enables the intact, prophage-containing
population to acquire beneficial genes from competing, phage-susceptible strains present in
the same environment. Phage infection kills competitor cells and bits of their DNA are
occasionally captured in viral transducing particles. Return of such particles to the prophage-
containing population can drive the transfer of genes encoding potentially useful traits such
as antibiotic resistance. This process, which can be viewed as ‘auto-transduction’, allows
S. aureus to efficiently acquire antibiotic resistance both in vitro and in an in vivo virulence
model (wax moth larvae) and enables it to proliferate under strong antibiotic selection
pressure. Our results may help to explain the rapid exchange of antibiotic resistance genes
observed in S. aureus.

 S
taphylococcus aureus causes serious and life-threatening
infections in humans, while at the same time colonizing
asymptomatically the skin and anterior nares of B30% of
the human population1. For S. aureus, antibiotic resistance is a
growing healthcare problem. Methicillin resistant S. aureus
strains have spread in recent years2 and resistance to other
clinically relevant antibiotics is developing3. Antibiotic resistance
genes are often carried on mobile genetic elements including
staphylococcal cassette chromosomes, S. aureus pathogenicity
islands (SaPIs), plasmids, transposons and phages3, which make
up 15–20% of the total S. aureus genome4. Antibiotic resistance
genes are commonly obtained by horizontal gene transfer of
mobile genetic elements, and in S. aureus phages are believed to
be particularly important for the transfer5. Nearly all strains carry
phages
stably
integrated
in
the
bacterial
chromosome
as
prophages4,5 and extensive mobility of phages and other mobile
genetic elements has been demonstrated between close relatives of
S. aureus6. The flexibility of a stable core genome and a large
accessory mobile genome is believed to account for the extreme
adaptability of S. aureus4,5,7. For example, such flexibility allowed
antibiotic-resistant clones of S. aureus to emerge and dominate in
a hospital environment characterized by a high antibiotic
selection pressure8 and in a controlled in vivo study transfer of
mobile genetic elements between S. aureus strains was observed
just 4 h after colonization of piglets9.
Phage-mediated transfer of genetic material is known as
transduction. Although prophages mostly remain inactive and are
replicated
with
the
bacterial
chromosome,
some
cells
in
prophage-containing
(lysogenic)
populations
may
undergo
prophage induction. Hereby, the phages enter a lytic life cycle
where they replicate, lyse the host cell, spread as phage particles,
and infect and lyse phage-susceptible cells in the environment10.
During replication, phage particles may occasionally encapsulate
fragments of bacterial DNA that can be transferred into newly
infected cells. This process of transduction, that is, the transfer of
genetic material from a donor to a recipient cell through such
transducing particles, was one of the first tools employed in
molecular biology to transfer genetic material between bacterial
cells11,12. Although being a useful genetic tool, transduction
is generally inefficient as transduced cells may be killed by
co-infection of virulent phages present during the transduction
process13. With this in mind, it is puzzling how phages contribute
to the extensive shuffling of genes that occurs among S. aureus
strains in vivo4–9,14.
Here we describe how phages released from a subpopulation of
lysogenic S. aureus are instrumental in acquiring antibiotic
resistance genes from neighbouring, phage-susceptible bacteria
and returning these resistance genes to the remaining, lysogenic
population. As the lysogenic S. aureus cells are immune to phage-
mediated killing, this process, which we have termed ‘auto-
transduction’, is highly efficient.
Results
Bacterial lysogens acquire antibiotic resistance genes. To study
the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes among S. aureus strains,
we co-cultured one lysogenic strain with one of three non-lyso-
genic strains. The lysogenic strain (8325-S) carried three
prophages (f11, f12 and f13) and was a derivative of the NCTC
8325 being streptomycin-resistant due to a mutation in rpsL
(A302G). The other strains were derivatives of the non-lysogenic
strain 8325-4, one of which (designated 8325-4 chrom) was
resistant to erythromycin due to ermB inserted in the chromo-
somal rot gene; a second strain (designated 8325-4 plasmid) was
resistant to chloramphenicol due to a cat gene on the non-con-
jugative plasmid pRMC2; and a third strain (designated 8325-4
SaPI) was resistant to tetracycline due to a tetM gene in the S.
aureus pathogenicity island SaPIbov1, a chromosomal genetic
element highly mobilized by phage f1115. Phenotypically, the
lysogenic strain 8325-S can be distinguished from the non-
lysogenic strains by a non-haemolytic phenotype caused by
elevated activity of the regulatory proteins SigB and SarS in 8325
strains as compared with the 8325-4 derivatives16.
After
selection
of
cells
resistant
to
a
combination
of
two antibiotics (streptomycin–tetracycline, streptomycin–chlora-
mphenicol and streptomycin–erythromycin, respectively), we
found double resistant mutants at the frequencies of 3 � 10 � 3,
5 � 10 � 4 and 4 � 10 � 6 per total colony-forming units (CFUs)
for 8325-4 SaPI, 8325-4 plasmid and 8325-4 chrom, respectively
(Fig. 1a). Surprisingly, as with 8325-S, all these cells were non-
haemolytic, which suggests that antibiotic resistance genes were
transferred from the non-lysogenic strains to the lysogenic strain
8325-S (Fig. 1b). This notion was confirmed when we obtained
the same resistance frequencies using a lysogenic strain that was
resistant to both streptomycin and rifampicin (termed 8325-SR)
and selecting for both of these resistances together with the
antibiotic resistance marker being transferred (Fig. 1a and
Supplementary Fig. 1). The transfer was not restricted to specific
antibiotic resistance genes, plasmids or genomic locations of the
resistance markers, as transfer was observed with other antibiotic
resistance markers at variable plasmid and genomic locations,
and verified by whole genome sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 2).
No double- or triple-resistant colonies were observed (detection
limit is o1e � 9 and o9e � 10 CFU ml � 1, respectively) when
8325-S or 8325-SR was co-cultured with 8325-4 not harbouring
an antibiotic resistance marker (Fig. 1a). Further, when the
lysogenic strains 8325-S or 8325-SR were substituted with the
phage-cured derivatives (JH977 or JH978, respectively) the
transfer of resistance genes was abolished, demonstrating that a
prophage is essential for the transfer.
Released phages mediate gene acquisition. The central role of
released phage in recruitment of antibiotic resistance genes was
demonstrated by the findings that the transfer required Ca2 þ
(Supplementary Fig. 3 and Fig. 1c), which is chelated by citrate
and is needed for adsorption of phages to bacterial cells13, did not
require contact between the lysogenic and the phage susceptible
cells (Fig. 1c) (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4 for
experimental setup) and was insensitive to DNase treatment
ruling out natural competence. However, f11 is capable of
transduction17 and transfer was abolished in strains harbouring
either a f11 derivative defective in packaging DNA into phage
particles (terL mutant) and severely reduced (5,000-fold) in a
strain expressing a non-inducible CI phage repressor (Fig. 1d). In
addition, transfer was dependent on RecA-mediated CI repressor
cleavage but not on induction of the SOS response (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5). Collectively, these results demonstrate that
released phage f11 is necessary and sufficient for the lysogenic
strain to recruit DNA by transduction. As the release of f11
phage appears to be a means for the lysogenic population to
acquire DNA from neighbouring phage-susceptible target cells,
the process may be explained as ‘autotransduction’.
To demonstrate the efficacy of autotransduction in comparison
with DNA transfer into phage-susceptible cells (the common
perception of transduction), we used a sterile filtered f11 phage
lysate obtained from 8325-4 SaPI to infect either phage cured
8325-SR (JH978) or the lysogen, 8325-SR, at multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 0.1 and 1. Such lysates will contain the phage
and rare transducing particles carrying DNA from the 8325-4
SaPI strain. Following infection of 8325-SR, transductants were
obtained at frequencies proportional to the amount of phage

 lysate added (Fig. 2a,b). In contrast, infection of JH978 led to a
dramatic reduction in bacterial numbers and no transductants
irrespective of the MOI (Fig. 2a,b). This is likely to be due to the
extensive, phage-mediated killing that occurs of both the infected
strain and any transductants formed during the 24 h experiment.
In traditional transduction experiments, phage exposure is brief
and the transductants are saved when adsorption of phage
is halted by citrate-mediated chelation of calcium ions13,18. In
contrast,
lysogenic cells
already carrying
a prophage
will
be immune to killing by their own phage19,20 and therefore
these restrictions do not apply to autotransduction. The phage
lysate was demonstrated to be sterile and in control cultures
(2–4 � 109 CFU ml � 1) that had no added phages, no resistant
colonies were obtained corresponding to a spontaneous resistance
frequency against tetracycline of o5 � 10 � 9. Consequently, in
the absence of laboratory manipulations, autotransduction of a
SaPI-borne antibiotic resistance marker is B106-fold more
efficient than regular transduction (Fig. 2a,b).
The majority of S. aureus strains are lysogenic for one or more
phages4 that could potentially interfere with the autotransduction
process. To determine whether DNA can be recruited from
strains carrying prophages other than the f11 phage family6, we
examined USA300 and Newman, which are lysogenic with
prophages fSA2usa, fSA3usa and fNM1 to fNM4, respectively.
In addition, USA300 carries erythromycin and tetracycline
resistance markers on native plasmids and Newman carries a
plasmid-borne tetracycline marker. Co-culture and subsequent
selection for 8325-SR and either of the two resistance markers of
USA300 in both cases resulted in a frequency of B6 � 10 � 5 of
triple resistant colonies per total CFU, while a lower frequency of
3 � 10 � 6 was observed in the Newman strain (Supplementary
Fig. 6) probably reflecting that phage f11 infects USA300 more
efficiently than Newman as shown in Supplementary Table 1.
These results show that autotransduction occurs despite the
presence of prophages other than f11 in the target strains.
Prophages provide a competitive advantage to its host. The
efficacy of autotransduction is in part attributed to virulent
phages propagating on and killing the phage-susceptible target
strain (Fig. 2). To assess the competitive advantage of harbouring
the f11 prophage, we co-cultured 8325-SR with 8325-4 chrom
(Supplementary Fig. 7a) or USA300 (Supplementary Fig. 7c).

lysogen efficiently outcompeted the non-lysogenic target cells
concomitant
with
significant
production
of
free
phages
(Supplementary Fig. 7b,d, respectively), an effect that was greatly
reduced by citrate. Within the timeframe of the experiment
lysogenized target cells were not detected, indicating that on a
short timescale released phages will provide the lysogenic popu-
lation with a competitive advantage over the phage-susceptible
targets,
as
previously
seen21.
This
result
supports
earlier
observations that released prophages may function as biological
weapons in competition with other bacteria22.
Given the dual action of prophages in acquisition of DNA and
killing of phage-susceptible cells, we hypothesized that auto-
transduction could be advantageous for the lysogen during
establishment in a new environment with a pre-existing bacterial
population. For this we chose to investigate how lysogenic 8325-
SR competed against another phage-susceptible strain (USA300)
when this was already growing on the surface of agar plates, by
analysing CFU of both strains over time. After 1 day, the initial
exponential growth had ceased for both strains and the number of
CFUs gradually declined over the next 16 days. Although the
lysogen 8325-SR experienced a 200-fold reduction during the
16 days of the experiment, the USA300 population experienced
a 5,000-fold decline in the presence of 8325-SR (Fig. 3a).
Importantly, even though no antibiotic selection was applied in
the agar plates, we observed a low number of 8325-SR colonies
resistant to tetracycline throughout the experiment, indicating
that the tetK marker initially located on a USA300-borne plasmid
was transferred to and maintained in 8325-SR without antibiotic
selection (Fig. 3a).
To assess the impact of autotransduction during antibiotic
selection, we co-cultured the erythromycin-sensitive lysogen
8325-SR together with the erythromycin-resistant 8325-4 chrom
(Fig. 3b) or USA300 (Fig. 3c) in the presence of increasing
concentrations of erythromycin. Even at antibiotic concentrations
lethal to 8325-SR, erythromycin-resistant 8325-SR transductants
emerged in the co-cultures, while the original lysogenic popula-
tion gradually declined with increasing antibiotic concentrations.
This effect was abolished by citrate. These data show that

 autotransduction allows the lysogen to survive and increase in
numbers even in the presence of counter selection, a trait that is
not possible when the phage is inactivated.
Lastly, to examine whether autotransduction occurs outside the
test tube, we infected Galleria mellonella wax moth larvae, a
commonly used virulence model for S. aureus with a 1:1 mix of
8325-SR and either 8325-4 SaPI or USA300. Just 1 hour post
infection, autotransduction was observed in the larvae infected
with the mix containing 8325-4 SaPI (Fig. 4a) but not after 6 h in
the mix containing USA300 (Fig. 4b) and not in the inoculum
used for injection. At 24 h post infection, autotransduction
approached
frequencies
comparable
to
those
observed
in
laboratory medium both in larvae infected with 8325-SR and
8325-4 SaPI or USA300. No transduction of 8325-4 SaPI or
USA300 was observed, implicating autotransduction in the
efficient spreading of antibiotic resistance genes in vivo.
Discussion
Here we describe a process by which spontaneously released
phages from a subpopulation of lysogenic bacteria propagate on
phage-susceptible, co-cultured target bacteria and, subsequently,
with high frequencies, transfer DNA from the lysed cells back to
the remaining lysogenic cell population. Owing to the activity of
the phage repressor, phages are unable to kill cells already
carrying the prophage19,23 but injection of DNA is not inhibited
and this allows the rare, transducing particles to deliver their
content to the immune, lysogenic cells where it may be incor-
porated (Fig. 5). Because of its resemblance to transduction, we
have termed this process ‘autotransduction’.
In S. aureus, the process of autotransduction by f11 is highly
efficient compared with transduction of cells that are not
lysogenic for the incoming phage. We found that 106-fold more
lysogenic cells are able to receive and establish an antibiotic
resistance marker present on a SaPI element compared with cells
that are not lysogenic. In fact, transduction of non-lysogenic cells
could only be detected if citrate was used to prevent phage-
mediated killing of transductants. Similarly, autotransduction, but
not transduction of non-lysogenic cells, took place in the wax
moth larva G. mellonella. These findings suggest that in natural
environments resistance genes may be transferred by auto-
transduction.
S. aureus f11 belongs to serological group B24 and generally
phages from serological groups B and F are capable of
transduction25. More recently, the transducing ability of phages
from serological groups A26 and L27 has been characterized and
other accounts of transducing phages have been reported7,28,
indicating that transduction capability is widespread among
staphylococcal phages. The host range of staphylococcal phages is
generally limited6,20, indicating that autotransduction is restricted
to occur between closely related strains. However, phages can
mediate the extensive transfer of genetic material between such
closely related S. aureus strains during in vivo colonization and
this adaptability is key to S. aureus success as a colonizer5–8. In a
recent study, DNA mobility was followed between pig-colonizing
S. aureus strains, where transfer of mobile genetic elements was
observed after just a few hours9. We show that auto-transduction
occurs at high frequency, allows lysogenic cells to proliferate
under conditions that are otherwise lethal for this population, and
that the acquired DNA is not restricted to specific antibiotic
resistance genes, plasmids or chromosomal locations. Overall, this
suggests that autotransduction may contribute to the mobility of
genetic elements between S. aureus genomes26,29,30 and as such
may play a role in successful colonization and infection by the
organism. For autotransduction to take place, the phage must be a
generalized
transducer
and
the
lysogen
susceptible
to
superinfection. However, if only a fraction of the world’s 1032
estimated phages harbour these properties, autotransduction may
be a major mechanism in bacterial acquisition of DNA. In fact,
Zinder and Lederberg31 already noted in their pioneering work
on transduction of Salmonella that transducing particles could
enter lysogenic cells. Although the impact of this observation
on efficacy of transduction in natural environments was not
pursued, it shows that autotransduction is probably not restricted
to S. aureus.
The autotransduction process requires that a fraction of the
lysogenic cells are killed, to release the phages. Although the
phage release appears as an altruistic act in which lysis of a
subpopulation benefits the remaining intact lysogenic population,
it can also be viewed as spite, as the phage release causes lysis of
the competing target cells32. In this respect, autotransduction
resembles some colicinogenic systems where individual colicin-
producing and lysing cells contribute to the fitness of the
remaining isogenic population33 but with the essential additional
benefit of acquiring genetic material from killed competitors.
Alternatively, autotransduction may be viewed as a consequence
of ‘selfish’ phages that improve survival of their bacterial hosts,
first by eliminating non-lysogenic competitors and, second, by the
acquisition of genes encoding beneficial phenotypes. Further
studies are required to detail the respective ecological benefits of
the autotransduction mechanism for the prophage and the
bacterial host.

can act in the interest of the hosting bacterial population by
diversifying its genetic repertoire.
Methods
Bacterial growth. Bacterial strains used in the study are listed in Supplementary
Table 2. S. aureus strains were grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB) from Difco, unless
otherwise noted. The medium was supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 or 20 mM
sodium citrate when phage propagation was wanted and unwanted, respectively.
Bacterial cultures were supplemented with relevant antibiotics at the following
concentrations, unless otherwise noted: 5 mg ml � 1 of erythromycin, 10 mg ml � 1 of
chloramphenicol, 50 mg ml � 1 of streptomycin, 0.5 mg ml � 1 of rifampicin,
5 mg ml � 1 of tetracycline and 100 mg ml � 1 of spectinomycin, all purchased from
Sigma. Cultures were incubated in 5 ml medium in sterile 15 ml plastic centrifuge
tubes at 37 �C with shake (180 r.p.m.).
Co-culture experiments in liquid. Relevant strains were inoculated to final
OD600 ¼ 0.01 in mixed cultures without antibiotics. Cultures were incubated for
24 h, unless otherwise noted. Before inoculation and at each sampling, the culture
was sonicated as previously described40, to ensure single-cell distribution in the
culture. Enumeration of individual strains in mixed cultures was done by plating
dilutions on blood agar plates containing relevant antibiotics. Differentiation
between strains in mixed cultures was further aided by differences in haemolysis
phenotypes.
Autotransduction frequencies were determined as the fraction of cells in a co-
culture that were resistant to the antibiotic markers carried by both of the co-
cultured strains relative to the total number of CFU.
Competitive interactions between two co-cultured strains were determined by
assessing the percentage of the lysogen relative to the sum of lysogenic and
susceptible cells and reported as ‘% lysogen’.
Separated culture experimental setup. To assess whether cell-to-cell contact is
needed for DNA transfer, we used cell-free supernatant of a 8325-S culture
containing spontaneously released phages for infection of phage-susceptible 8325-4
SaPI. After 2 h incubation allowing time for lysis of the 8225-4 SaPI population,
cell-free supernatant from this culture was used to re-infect the lysogenic 8325-S
strain in the presence or absence of citrate or DNAaseI treatment. The DNAaseI
activity was demonstrated by comparison of gel electrophoresis and transduction
data for DNA with or without prior DNaseI treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4b,c,
respectively). After overnight incubation, frequency of double resistant mutants of
total CFU was determined.
Whole genome sequencing and single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis.
DNA from overnight cultures was extracted using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA concentrations were measured and normalized
using a Qubit flourometer (Invitrogen, UK) and libraries were prepared using
Illumina Nextera XT DNA preparation kit. Sequencing of libraries was performed
on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (Illumina, USA) at the Department of Clinical
Microbiology, Hvidovre University Hospital, Denmark. Samples were multiplexed
to 24 samples per sequencing reaction and sequenced using 2 � 150 bp paired-end
reads. Genomes were assembled de novo using Velvet (v.1.0.11) and VelvetOpti-
miser (v.2.1.7). Variants were detected using a reference-based single-nucleotide
polymorphism mapping via Stampy41. Reads were mapped to the S. aureus
USA300 strain TCH1516 (Genbank accession no. NC_010079) using Stampy
(v.1.0.11) and single-nucleotide polymorphism calling was performed using
SAMtools v.0.1.12.
Phylogeny analysis was performed by neighbour-joining analysis based
on the pairwise sequence alignment of genomes defined by the reference genome
USA300 strain TCH1516. Trees were subsequently created using FigTree
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree) and the phylogeny analysis was used to
confirm that transductants originated from the lysogenic population.
Enumeration of phages and efficiency of plaquing. f11 was enumerated by
spotting dilutions of 0.2 mm filtered supernatant on the indicator strain RN4220.
Other phages released from USA300 or Newman were enumerated by flow
cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur) as previously described42. Following
changes to the protocol were applied: lysate was incubated at room temperature
instead of 80 �C. Settings were as follows: forward scatter ¼ 404V, side
scatter ¼ 605V, green fluorescent channel ¼ 520V. Efficiency of plaquing for lysates
from all three strains was calculated as the ratio of plaque-forming units (PFU) to
number of phage particles determined by flowcytometry.
Infection with phage lysate. A phage lysate was produced by co-culturing 8325-
SR with 8325-4 SaPI for 4 h followed by centrifugation and sterile filtration of the
supernatant. The titre of the lysate was determined by plaquing on RN4220. The

Figure 5 | Autotransduction model. (A) Spontaneous phage induction mediated by RecA cleavage of the CI phage repressor from a subpopulation of a
lysogenic bacterial population allows the phage to infect a susceptible co-existing bacterial population. (B) Propagation on the susceptible population and
subsequent lysis releases phage progeny along with low numbers of transducing particles. (C) Owing to immunity to its own phages, the lysogenic
population can ‘filter out’ the infective phage progeny and allow the occasional transducing particle to deliver its DNA to the lysogenic population by
autotransduction.

 lysate was used to infect a culture of 8325-SR or 8325-4 (JH978), both at
OD600 ¼ 0.01 at MOI of 1 and 0.1. Following incubation overnight, the total
CFU ml � 1, transductants ml � 1 and PFU ml � 1 were determined by plating on
appropriate medium.
Competition on solid surface. Pre-culture of USA300 was adjusted to
OD600 ¼ 0.5 and 100 ml was spread on agar plates containing 25 mM CaCl2.
Following 6 h incubation at 37 �C growth was visible as a thin layer of bacteria. At
this time, 10 ml of 8325-SR adjusted to OD600 ¼ 1 was spotted on to the USA300
bacterial lawn at a ratio of B1 cell of 8325-SR per 10 cells of USA300. At selected
time points, equal size areas of the agar were stamped out from the middle of the
interaction zone and added to 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl. Vigorous vortex mixing and
sonication was used to suspend the cells from the agar plug. Dilutions were then
spotted on blood agar plates containing the relevant antibiotics to distinguish the
8325-SR, USA300 and transductant populations.
Competition in liquid culture. The lysogenic strain (8325-SR) and a phage
susceptible strain (either 8325-4 chrom or USA300) were inoculated at 1:1 ratios to
OD600 ¼ 0.01 in TSB containing varying concentrations of erythromycin against
which 8325-SR is sensitive (minimal inhibitory concentration ¼ 0.625 mg ml � 1)
and the phage susceptible strains are resistant (minimal inhibitory
concentration440 mg ml � 1). Following 24 h incubation the cultures were plated
on agar containing antibiotics selective for the lysogen or the susceptible strain, or
triple resistant transductant cells, and data were plotted as percentage of the
lysogen or transductants relative to the total CFU ml � 1.
G. mellonella model. We used an existing infection model43,44 modified by
reducing the inoculum of bacteria to prevent rapid killing of the larvae45. No
statistical methods were used to determine sample size. Healthy fifth instar wax
moth larvae were randomly chosen from a batch purchased at a local pet store
(Minizoo, Tårnby). Using a Hamilton syringe and multi-dispenser, to ensure
repetitive injections of 10 ml, 20 larvae per condition were injected with 10 ml S.
aureus culture containing a total of 106 CFU consisting of a 1:1 ratio of 8325-SR
and 8325-4 SaPI or USA300, and incubated at 37 �C. After 0, 1 or 6 and 24 h, dead
larvae were recorded and haemolymph from all 20 larvae (living and dead) was
squeezed into 0.9% NaCl and sonicated before dilutions were spotted on blood agar
plates containing relevant antibiotics. Blinding was not done during these
experiments.
Selection of streptomycin- and rifampicin-resistant mutants. Overnight
cultures of relevant strains were adjusted to OD600 ¼ 2 and 50 ml aliquots were
spread on agar plates containing either 100 mg ml � 1 streptomycin or 0.5 mg ml � 1
of rifampicin. Colonies appearing after overnight incubation at 37 �C were re-
streaked on either streptomycin or rifampicin. The obtained mutants were stored at
� 80 �C. Growth rate measurements of the resistant mutants compared with the
wild-type strains confirmed that no growth defect was associated with the muta-
tions (Supplementary Table 4).
Transduction. Standard phage transduction methods using f11 or f80a were
used to transfer mutations or plasmids of interest between strains18. Briefly, phages
were propagated on a donor strain containing the plasmid or gene of interest,
resulting in a phage lysate containing transducing particles. This lysate was used to
infect a recipient strain and transductants were obtained by plating on selective
medium. Phage killing of the recipient strain was inhibited by administration of
citrate after phage infection.
Gene expression. Relevant strains harbouring a recA promoter fused lacZ reporter
were inoculated to OD600 ¼ 0.01 in pre-warmed TSB and incubated at 37 �C. At
indicated time points, bacterial growth was monitored using optical density mea-
surement and plate spreading, phage release was monitored by measuring PFU in
the supernatant and recA expression was measured using standard b-galactosidase
assay46 with the exception that cells were opened by 30 min exposure to
15 mg ml � 1 lysostaphin (sigma) at 37 �C.
Statistics. All experiments were performed in biological triplicates. Averages were
compared by t-test, two-sided, using the GraphPad Prism software.
Data availability. All relevant data are available from the authors. Genome
sequences have been deposited at European Nucleotide Archive, accession number
PRJEB15200.
