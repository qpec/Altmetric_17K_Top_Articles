Objective: Sedentary behavior (SB) is associated with poor 
cognitive performance in the general population. Although 
people with schizophrenia are highly sedentary and expe-
rience marked cognitive impairments, no study has investi-
gated the relationship between SB and cognition in people 
with schizophrenia. Methods: A total of 199 inpatients with 
schizophrenia (mean [SD] age 44.0 [9.9] years, 61.3% male, 
mean [SD] illness duration 23.8 [6.5]) and 60 age and sex 
matched controls were recruited. Sedentary behavior and 
physical activity (PA) were captured for 7 consecutive days 
with an accelerometer. Cognitive performance was assessed 
using the Vienna Test System, and the Grooved Pegboard 
Test. Multivariate regression analyses adjusting for impor-
tant confounders including positive and negative symp-
toms, illness duration, medication, and PA were conducted. 
Results: The 199 patients with schizophrenia engaged in 
significantly more SB vs controls (581.1 (SD 127.6) vs 336.4 
(SD 107.9) min per day, P < .001) and performed worse in all 
cognitive performance measures (all P < .001). Compared 
to patients with high levels of SB (n = 89), patients with 
lower levels of SB (n = 110) had significantly (P < .05) 
better motor reaction time and cognitive processing. In the 
fully adjusted multivariate analysis, SB was independently 
associated with slower motor reaction time (β = .162, P < 
.05) but not other cognitive outcomes. Lower levels of PA 
were independently associated with worse attention and 
processing speed (P < .05). Conclusion: Our data suggest 
that higher levels of sedentary behavior and physical inac-
tivity are independently associated with worse performance 
across several cognitive domains. Interventions targeting 
reductions in SB and increased PA should be explored.

Introduction
Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with a 
lifetime prevalence of 1% with a heterogeneous genetic 
and neurobiological background that influences early 
brain development, and is expressed as a combination 
of psychotic symptoms—such as hallucinations, delu-
sions, and disorganization.1 The burgeoning evidence 
base has established that schizophrenia is associated with 
considerable cognitive impairment.2 Specifically, research 
has demonstrated that schizophrenia is associated with 
deficits across multiple domains including attention, 
processing speed, working memory, verbal learning and 
memory, and executive functions.3 Cognitive dysfunc-
tion is evident in those with the at risk mental state,4,5 
experiencing their first episode6 and cognitive defi-
cits in schizophrenia endure over the course of illness.7 
Understanding factors that are associated with cogni-
tive performance are important, because cognitive defi-
cits are associated with increased healthcare costs,8 lower 
quality of life, and impaired recovery.9 A range of fac-
tors have been associated with cognitive performance in 
schizophrenia including genetic predisposition,10 hypo-
function of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors,11 
negative symptoms, sociodemographic and illness factors 
(eg, male gender, illness duration).12 Most recently, novel 
research has suggested that physical activity appears to 
be associated with better cognitive performance and in 
particular attention/concentration.13
Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement 
produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expen-
diture.14 Physical activity sits on a spectrum, ranging from 
low intensity physical activity (eg, light walking) to high 
intensity activity (eg, fast running) and is categorized 
based on energy expenditure. At the opposite end of

Sedentary Behavior and Cognitive Performance
the spectrum, is sedentary behavior, which is defined as 
any waking activity characterized by an energy expendi-
ture ≤1.5 metabolic equivalents.15 Examples of sedentary 
behaviors may include prolonged sitting or remaining in 
reclined posture during the day time. In the general popu-
lation, there is an increasing evidence base to suggest that 
sedentary behavior is independent from physical activity 
associated with worse cognitive performance.16 Higher 
levels of sedentary behavior are associated with worse 
cognitive performance across the lifespan including in 
children17 and older adults.18 A recent systematic review 
of 8 studies concluded that higher levels of sedentary 
behavior were associated with worse cognitive function.16
Despite the growing interest in the potential del-
eterious impact of sedentary behavior in people with 
schizophrenia, no study has to our knowledge inves-
tigated the relationship with cognitive performance. 
Nonetheless, a recent meta-analysis19 established that 
people with schizophrenia engage in very high levels 
of sedentary behavior. To date, only 2 studies20,21 have 
investigated the relationship between sedentary behav-
ior and health outcomes in people with schizophrenia, 
and both established a negative relationship with car-
diometabolic markers. Although helpful, Stubbs et al20 
and Vancampfort et al21 relied upon self-report sed-
entary behavior (which is prone to bias19) and did not 
include a control group. Only 5 published studies have 
utilized objective measures of sedentary behavior in 
people with schizophrenia,22–26 of which, only one study 
included a control group,24 and all included modest 
sample sizes (n < 50). There is also provisional evidence 
that higher light physical activity may be associated with 
better cognitive performance.13 It remains unclear if the 
relationship between physical activity and cognitive per-
formance is independent from sedentary behavior and 
vice versa. Nonetheless, given the relationship between 
sedentary behavior and cognition in the general popu-
lation, the high levels of sedentary behavior and cog-
nitive deficits in people with schizophrenia, research is 
required to explore if sedentary behavior and low physi-
cal activity are associated with cognition in this popula-
tion. In addition, it is important that research considers 
if a relationship between sedentary behavior and cogni-
tion would also be evident after adjusting for important 
confounders known to influence both factors such as 
negative symptoms.25,27
The aims of the current study were to (1) investigate 
sedentary behavior levels in people with schizophrenia 
compared to controls using accelerometer, (2) investi-
gate the relationship between sedentary behavior and 
cognitive performance in people with schizophrenia and 
compare this to controls, and (3) Explore the possible 
independent associations between sedentary behavior 
and low physical activity and cognitive performance in 
people with schizophrenia.
Methods
Participants
The current study recruited participants from the long 
stay psychiatric wards at Jianan Mental Hospital, 
Taiwan. Inclusion criteria were (1) diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia (according to DSM IV made by an independent 
psychiatrist), (2) stable and on the same antipsychotic 
medicine for at least 3 months. Patients who were unable 
to communicate, walk independently or had any neuro-
logical disorders were excluded.
Healthy Control Group. The healthy control group con-
sisted of age-, gender-, and BMI-matched comparison 
participants recruited among the staff of 2 hospitals and 
universities. Eligibility criteria for controls included (1) 
no present or past history of any mental illness and (2) 
not taking any psychotropic medication. A total of 60 
participants were selected to ensure comparable gender 
balance, age, and BMI ranges to the schizophrenia group.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of Jianan Mental Hospital. All participants pro-
vided informed written consent.
Measures
Outcome Variable: Cognitive Function Assessments 
Vienna Test System (VTS). All participants (including 
controls) completed the cognitive outcome measures. The 
VTS is a computerized neurocognitive function assess-
ment consisting of various personality, intelligence, and 
psychomotor abilities.28 The VTS has been used in pre-
vious studies,29,30 including those with schizophrenia31 
to determine cognitive performance. Specifically, within 
the current study, 2 subsets of the VTS were used: the 
Reaction test (RT) and Cognitrone test (COG). The RT 
measures the determination of reaction time to visual 
stimulus of individuals and the test last between 5 and 
10 min. Participants place their hands on the rest but-
ton, and are asked to push it as soon as possible when 
they detect a visual stimulus. The reaction and motor 
time is calculated in milliseconds (msec), which is the 
time between the start of the relevant stimulus and the 
moment the finger leaves the rest button.
The COG test captures the attention and concentra-
tion through the comparison of figures with regard to 
their congruence on a computer screen. Within the COG 
test, participants are presented with an abstract figure 
which they have to match to a model. The variable of 
the number of reactions made within the total working 
time of 7 min provides information on the respondent’s 
processing speed.28
Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT). The GPT is a test of 
manual dexterity, upper-limb motor speed, hand-eye 
coordination, and speed of processing and has been

widely used in previous research.32–35 The GPT consists 
of 25 holes with randomly positioned slots. The pegs 
have a key along one side and must be put in the board 
in a fixed order and in the correct direction with only one 
hand being used. Participants are encouraged to perform 
the task as quickly as possible. Each participant is scored 
by the total time in seconds from when they starts the 
task until the last peg is put in place. For the purposes of 
the current study, each participant was tested once with 
their dominant and nondominant hand (ie, a total of 2 
times) and the average was calculated to give an overall 
score.
Independent 
Variable: 
Sedentary 
Behavior 
Time. Sedentary 
behavior was captured using the ActiGraph (wActiSleep), 
a tri-axial accelerometer. The ActiGraph has been vali-
dated previously among people with schizophrenia.36–38 
The measurement of sedentary behavior with acceler-
ometers is the optimal free living measure in people with 
schizophrenia, with self-report measures such as the IPAQ 
lacking accuracy.39 Standardized instructions of wearing 
an accelerometer were provided by research assistants. 
Participants were asked to wear the accelerometer on the 
wrist of the nondominant hand for 7 consecutive days and 
to remove it during bathing or water activities. The acceler-
ometers were initialized, downloaded, and analyzed using 
ActiLife software version 6 (ActiGraph LLC). Sedentary 
behavior was defined according to the cut-off point out-
lined by Freedson40 as activities ≦100 counts per minute 
(cpm), representing a threshold corresponding with sitting, 
reclining, or lying down. The sedentary behavior time was 
only measured during the waking day of each individual. 
The total energy expenditure of physical activity per week 
was also calculated by the software. Sedentary behavior 
and total physical activity were categorized into 2 levels by 
the mean: “low and high” in a binary split at the mean.
Covariates. A range of sociodemographic informa-
tion was collected including data on age (<40 or ≥40), 
sex, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and educa-
tion (<9 schooling years or ≥9 schooling years). Based 
on self-report answers, participants were categorized into 
2 groups: “yes” (current/former smoker or drinker) and 
“no” (never). Body weight and height were measured 
and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in 
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/
m2). BMI classifications of obesity reflect risks for type 
2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and varies among 
ethnic groups.41 Therefore, the national criteria of obesity 
in Taiwan were used to determine weight status (normal/
underweight <24, overweight/obesity ≥24).42
Metabolic Syndrome and Associated Metabolic Risk 
Factors. Details regarding the metabolic syndrome 
(MetS) criteria and associated risk factors were collected 
including waist circumference, systolic/diastolic blood 
pressure (SBP/DBP), serum triglyceride (TG), high-den-
sity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and fasting glu-
cose (FG). Abnormalities in MetS were classified based 
on the following criteria: waist circumference ≥90 cm in 
men and ≥80 cm in women; SBP/DBP ≥130/85 mmHg; 
TG ≥150 mg/dl; HDL-C <40 mg/dl in men and <50 mg/
dl in women; and FG ≥100 mg/dl. We used the number 
of abnormalities in MetS in the analyses and it requires 
meeting 3 or more of the five criteria to be diagnosed 
with MetS.
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. All partici-
pants completed the Positive and Negative Syndrome 
Scale (PANSS), a tool specifically developed to assess 
the severity of symptoms and measure general psycho-
pathology among patients with schizophrenia.43 It is a 
30-item rating scale, consisting of 3 subscales: 7-item 
Positive Symptoms, 7-item Negative Symptoms, and 
16-item General Psychopathology. For each item, there 
are 7 rating points with increasing levels of psychopa-
thology severity from 1 (asymptomatic) to 7 (extremely 
symptomatic). The PANSS score is the sum of ratings 
across items, with ranging from 7 to 49 for the Positive 
and Negative Scales and 16 to 112 for the General 
Psychopathology Scale. Higher scores indicate more 
severe symptoms.
Medication. Information 
regarding 
antipsychotics 
medication and sleeping pills use was collected through 
the hospital records. Antipsychotics medication use was 
converted into a daily equivalent dosage of chlorproma-
zine44 and the daily equipotent dosage of Lorazepam 
were also calculated for each patient according to the 
defined daily dose (DDD) of WHO Collaborating Centre 
for Drug Statistics Methodology (http://www.whocc.no/
ddd/definition_and_general_considera/).
Statistical Analyses
Independent t-tests and chi-square tests were performed 
to compare the percentages or differences between lev-
els of sedentary time in participants with schizophre-
nia. Differences of cognitive function, sedentary time, 
and physical activity energy expenditure between par-
ticipants with and without schizophrenia were examined 
by independent t-tests. To examine the association of 
sedentary levels on cognition function, a 2-step forced 
entry multivariate regression analysis was performed for 
each cognitive test. In the multivariate linear regression, 
the dependent variable was sedentary behavior levels 
and variables entered into the model were demographic 
variables (age, sex, education), weight status, smoking, 
alcohol consumption, medications, PANSS, and MetS, 
followed by physical activity energy expenditure. All 
analyses were performed with IBM SPSS statistics 22 and 
a 2-tailed P-value less than .05 was considered as statisti-
cally significant.

Sedentary Behavior and Cognitive Performance
Results
A total of 200 potential inpatients were identified as 
suitable for the study. Overall, 199 patients with schizo-
phrenia gave informed consent and were recruited with a 
mean age of 44.0 years (SD 9.9), 61.3% were male with 
a mean illness duration of 23.8 years (SD 6.5). Sixty age 
and sex matched controls were also recruited (mean age 
41.1 (9.6) years, 56.7% male).
Sedentary Behavior, Clinical, and Cognitive Outcomes 
in Patients
Patients with schizophrenia were divided into low levels 
of sedentary behavior (n = 110, <581.1 min per day) and 
high levels of sedentary behavior (n = 89, ≥581.1 min per 
day). Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical out-
comes for both groups. Briefly, no difference in gender, 
age, or education was observed, although those who were 
more sedentary were less likely to smoke (table 1). No dif-
ference in psychiatric symptoms, chlorpromazine equiv-
alents or illness duration was noted, although the less 
sedentary group had been admitted for longer. Patients 
who were more sedentary had worse motor reaction time 
and speed processing (P < .05) and engaged in less physi-
cal activity.
Sedentary Behavior and Cognition in Patients and 
Controls
Patients with schizophrenia engaged in significantly more 
sedentary behavior vs controls (581.1 min per day vs 
336.4 min per day, P < .001) equating to a mean difference 
of 244.6 min per day or 4 h and 7 min per day. Patients 
with schizophrenia also engaged in less total physical

Exploring the Independent Relationships Between 
Sedentary Behavior and Low Physical Activity and 
Cognition
The multivariate associations between sedentary behav-
ior and other outcomes with cognitive performance in 
the adjusted model with and without adjusting for physi-
cal activity are outlined in tables 2 and 3, respectively. 
Patients with schizophrenia who engaged in higher levels 
of sedentary behavior had a slower motor reaction time 
(β = .175, P = .026), while no relationship was observed 
with the Cognitrone or Grooved Pegboard Test. After 
adjusting for physical activity, the relationship between 
higher levels of sedentary behavior was independently 
associated with slower motor reaction times (β = .162, 
P = .042). Lower levels of physical activity were indepen-
dently associated with worse attention and concentration 
(Cognitrone scores) (β = −.222, P = .008) and poorer 
processing speed and manual dexterity (GPT scores, 
β = .309, P < .001) in the fully adjusted model.
Discussion
The current study is the largest to investigate objective 
sedentary behavior in people with schizophrenia and 
controls and has several novel findings. First, our data 
suggest that sedentary behavior is associated with worse 
motor reaction time, independent from multiple con-
founders. Second, our data show that among patients, 
those with higher levels of sedentary behavior appear to 
have worse speed processing and motor reaction times 
compared with those who are less sedentary. Third, lower 
levels of physical activity appear to be independently 
associated with poorer processing speed, attention, and 
dexterity. Fourth, our data are the first to suggest that 
sedentary behavior and physical inactivity (less physical 
activity) are independently associated with neurocog-
nition. Finally, our data also confirm that people with 
schizophrenia engage in significantly more sedentary 
behavior (mean difference 4 h and 7 min per day) and less 
total physical activity than age and sex matched controls.
The potential mechanisms through which sedentary 
behavior may influence cognitive performance among 
people with schizophrenia are yet to be elucidated. One 
potential explanation is that the high levels of obesity 
and glucose/lipid metabolism alterations in people with 
schizophrenia,45,46 which are known to influence cogni-
tion in the general population through atrophy in sev-
eral brain regions and hippocampal dysfunction,47 could 
play an integral role. Excess sedentary behavior in the 
general population is known to increase the risk of car-
diometabolic disease48 with around an extra hour a day 
being associated with a 22% and 39% increased risk of 
diabetes and MetS, respectively.49 Some preliminary work 
has demonstrated that excess self-reported sedentary 
behavior is associated with elevated C reactive protein20 
and MetS21 in people with schizophrenia. There is also 
emerging evidence that obesity is associated with worse 
cognitive performance among people with schizophre-
nia.50,51 Therefore, the hazards of obesity and metabolic 
alterations may be influenced by sedentary behavior, and 
extend beyond contributing to the excess mortality52 and 
also negatively influence cognition. An alternative expla-
nation might also be that cognitive impairment may exac-
erbate negative symptoms (such as avolition) and reduce 
social functioning, both of which would increases the 
likelihood of sedentary behavior. Clearly, given the cross

Sedentary Behavior and Cognitive Performance
sectional nature of our work, more longitudinal research 
is required to disentangle these potential relationships 
and confirm the directionality to test these hypotheses.
The objective sedentary behavior data from the current 
study includes data on more people with schizophrenia 
than all of the previous 5 published studies pooled in a 
prior meta-analysis.20 Our results found that that people 
with schizophrenia were sedentary for on average 581.1 min 
per day, which is comparable with the recent meta-analysis 
in this patient group (599 min per day).19 It is worth noting 
this amount of sedentary behavior is among the highest 
reported in any clinical population. The difference between 
patients with schizophrenia and controls in sedentary 
behavior was very high (over 4 h) and is clearly concern-
ing, not only for the potential relationship with poor cog-
nition, but also due to the robust evidence in the general

population that sedentary behavior is associated with car-
diovascular disease and associated mortality.48 Previously, 
a study found that people with schizophrenia that spent 
1.5 h of self-report sedentary behavior more than another 
group of patients, was associated with an increased level of 
C reactive protein (>5.0 mg/μl). Our data also suggest that 
the difference in sedentary behavior between low and high 
sedentary patients (mean difference =196.4 min per day) 
is associated with reduced cognitive function. An impor-
tant area for future research is to explore with longitudi-
nal/interventional data if reducing sedentary behavior in 
patients can improve cognition and indeed the inflamma-
tory profile of people with schizophrenia.
Interestingly, we found that physical inactivity (lower 
levels of physical activity) is independently associated 
with worse processing speed and attention among our 
population with established psychosis. Although the rela-
tionship between physical activity and cognition is rea-
sonably well established in the general population,53 our 
data offer further evidence of the potential benefits of 
physical activity in people with schizophrenia. The rela-
tionship between low physical activity and these cognitive 
performance measures appears independent of sedentary 
behavior and other important confounders (eg, positive 
and negative symptoms, antipsychotic medication) and is 
the first data to demonstrate this independent relation-
ship. There have been pressing calls for members of the 
multidisciplinary team to reduce sedentary behavior in 
people with psychosis due to the potential deleterious 
impact on cardiometabolic health54 and an important 
future research question is whether replacing sedentary 
time with physical activity can improve health outcomes. 
There is an emerging evidence base from RCTs that aero-
bic exercise can improve cognition,55 as to whether spe-
cifically targeting reductions in sedentary behavior can 
prevent decline in cognitive performance and/or improve 
cognition is an important area for future research. The 
potential mechanism by which physical activity could 
improve cognitive performance may be related to hippo-
campal neurogenesis, although the literature is equivocal 
among people with schizophrenia to date.56 Regardless, 
given the established benefits of physical activity on 
various health dimensions among people with schizo-
phrenia,57 and relatively low levels of activity,58 physical 
activity should be encouraged among this group.
Although our data are the largest study investigating 
objective sedentary behavior and include multiple novel 
results, some limitations exist. The primary limitation is 
that the data is cross sectional and therefore it is impor-
tant that future longitudinal work disentangles the rela-
tionships we observed. Second, the study included people 
with established psychosis who were inpatients which 
limits the generalizability. Future research in the earlier 
stages of illness is required to see if similar relationships 
exist. In particular, interventions targeting reductions in 
sedentary behavior in those with first episode psychosis 
should consider if cognitive performance subsequently 
improves. There is some provisional evidence that physi-
cal exercise can improve cognition in people with first epi-
sode psychosis59 and whether or not reducing sedentary 
behavior in this group can improve cognition is an impor-
tant future research question. Third, the variance explored 
by our models was relatively modest, which does suggest 
that other factors not accounted for in our study may 
also account for the relationships we observed. Finally, 
we did not conduct any additional post hoc tests to adjust 
for multiple testing; therefore there is possibility of type 
I errors in the data. Clearly, future longitudinal research 
is required to confirm/refute our exploratory data.
In conclusion, the largest study using objective mea-
sures of sedentary behavior in schizophrenia to date, 
suggests that sedentary behavior may be related to 
reduced motor reaction time. Moreover, patients with 
higher levels of sedentary behavior appear to have worse 
cognitive performance than those engaging in less seden-
tary behavior. Higher levels of physical activity appear 
to be associated with better cognitive performance inde-
pendent of sedentary behavior and multiple other fac-
tors. Clearly, future longitudinal data are required to 
confirm/refute our findings. Nonetheless, given the del-
eterious impact of sedentary behavior on multiple health 
outcomes, interventions specifically targeting reducing 
sedentary behavior are required among this highly sed-
entary population.
