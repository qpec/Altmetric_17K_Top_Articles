IMPORTANCE Depression is common among training physicians and may disproportionately
affect women. The identification of modifiable risk factors is key to reducing this disease
burden and its negative impact on patient care and physician career attrition.
OBJECTIVE To determine the presence and magnitude of a sex difference in depressive
symptoms and work-family conflict among training physicians; and if work-family conflict
impacts the sex difference in depressive symptoms among training physicians.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective longitudinal cohort study of medical
internship in the United States during the 2015 to 2016 academic year in which 3121 interns
were recruited across all specialties from 44 medical institutions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prior to and during their internship year, participants
reported the degree to which work responsibilities interfered with family life using the Work
Family Conflict Scale and depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9
(PHQ-9).
RESULTS Mean (SD) participant age was 27.5 (2.7) years, and 1571 participants (49.7%) were
women. Both men and women experienced a marked increase in depressive symptoms
during their internship year, with the increase being statistically significantly greater for
women (men: mean increase in PHQ-9, 2.50; 95% CI, 2.26-2.73 vs women: mean increase,
3.20; 95% CI, 2.97-3.43). When work-family conflict was accounted for, the sex disparity in
the increase in depressive symptoms decreased by 36%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our study demonstrates that depressive symptoms increase
substantially during the internship year for men and women, but that this increase is greater
for women. The study also identifies work-family conflict as an important potentially
modifiable factor that is associated with elevated depressive symptoms in training physicians.
Systemic modifications to alleviate conflict between work and family life may improve
physician mental health and reduce the disproportionate depression disease burden for
female physicians. Given that depression among physicians is associated with poor patient
care and career attrition, efforts to alleviate depression among physicians has the potential to
reduce the negative consequences associated with this disease.

epression is common among training physicians, with
25% to 30% of trainees experiencing elevated depres-
sive symptoms.1 In addition to the individual disease
burden associated with depression, depression among physi-
cians in training is associated with poor quality of patient care,
medical errors, and career attrition.2-5
The burden of depression among physicians may fall dis-
proportionately on women.6-8 A subset of studies9,10 investi-
gatingdepressionamongtrainingphysicianshavefoundhigher
rates among female physicians, but the majority of studies11,12
have not investigated sex differences in depression. Further-
more, specific factors that explain sex differences in depres-
sion have not been identified.
One factor that may affect female and male physicians dif-
ferently is work-family conflict, where work obligations nega-
tively impact family roles. Despite the increased presence of
women in the medical workforce, female physicians take on
significantly more household and childcare duties than their
male counterparts.13 Because of this unequal division of do-
mestic labor, female physicians are more likely to report limi-
tations in their career for family reasons.14 The competing, of-
ten incompatible, pressures associated with these work and
family responsibilities can result in the experience of work-
family conflict.
For female physicians, work-family conflict is signifi-
cantly correlated with burnout15,16 and emotional
exhaustion.17,18 These findings suggest that understanding
work-family conflict may be important in understanding sex
differences in physician mental health.
With long work hours and a low degree of job autonomy
and control, medical internship is a particularly challenging
time for balancing work and family responsibilities. To our
knowledge, no studies have yet examined whether sex differ-
ences in work-family conflict exist among training physi-
cians, nor to what extent these differences contribute to a sex
disparity in depressive symptoms. The aims of this study are
to: (1) determine the presence and magnitude of a sex differ-
ence in depressive symptoms and work-family conflict; and
(2) determine if work-family conflict impacts any sex differ-
ence in depressive symptoms among training physicians.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
Followingthe2015to2016nationalresidencymatch,emailad-
dresses for medical students matching into residency pro-
grams across all specialties throughout the United States were
gathered from program directors, medical school administra-
tors, and publicly available databases (Box). Eligible partici-
pants, including 5150 medical students, were sent an email 2
months prior to commencing internship inviting them to par-
ticipate in the study. Of 5150 invitees, 3121 (61%) agreed to par-
ticipate and were asked to complete online assessments 2
months prior to the start of the internship year and at 6 months
into the internship year. The institutional review board at the
UniversityofMichiganapprovedthestudyandgrantedawaiver
of signed informed consent. Participants were provided a $25
gift certificate after completing the baseline survey and a $25
gift certificate after completing the follow-up survey.
Data Collection
All data were collected through secure online surveys using
Qualtrics survey software. Potential participants were emailed
a brief description of the study with a link to the online in-
formedconsentwheretheycould“agree”or“notagree”totake
part in the study. Those who agreed were directed to the base-
line survey. No further contact was made if the individual de-
clined participation. If no response was provided to the on-
line informed consent, 2 reminder emails were sent 1 week
apart. One final email reminder was sent 2 weeks prior to the
start of the internship year if there was no response to the sec-
ond email reminder. An email with a link to the follow-up sur-
vey was sent to consenting participants 6 months into the in-
ternship year. If the survey was not submitted, the participant
received 2 reminder emails 1 week apart.
Survey data was coded with a unique nondecodable iden-
tification and no other identifying information. The link be-
tween the participant’
s email address and identification was
keptinaseparatepassword-protectedelectronicfilethatcould
only be accessed by study personnel so that the follow-up sur-
vey could be sent. Following completion of the study, the link

was destroyed.
Initial Assessment
Prior to the start of the internship year, participants reported
general demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity, num-
ber of children, relationship status), depressive symptoms
through the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and con-
flictbetweenworkandfamilyrolesthroughtheWorkandFam-
ily Conflict Scale.
The PHQ-9 is the self-report component of the PRIME-MD
(Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders) inventory de-
signed to screen for depressive symptoms. For each of the 9
DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
[Fifth Edition]) depressive symptoms, participants indi-
cated whether, during the previous 2 weeks, the symptom had
bothered them “not at all,” for “several days,” for “more than
half the days,” or “nearly every day.” Each item yields a score
Key Points
Questions Does depression disproportionately affect female
physicians compared with male physicians during the internship
year, and does work-family conflict impact the sex difference in
depressive symptoms among training physicians?
Findings Women experience a greater increase in depressive
symptoms compared with men during their internship year;
however, when work-family conflict is accounted for, the sex
disparity in depressive symptoms is reduced by more than
one-third (36%).
Meaning Systemic modifications to alleviate conflict between
work and family life may improve physician mental health and,
in turn, improve patient care and reduce physician career attrition.

A score of 10 or greater on the PHQ-9 has a sensitivity of 88%

Diagnostic validity of the PHQ-9 is comparable to clinician-
administered assessments.20
The Work and Family Conflict Scale was designed to evalu-
ate potential aspects of work and family conflict based on
strain, time, and behavioral factors. “Family” is defined from
the participant’
s perspective. The Work and Family Conflict
Scale measures the conflict that arises when work responsi-
bilitiesundesirablyaffectfamilyrolesandincludes5items.Re-
spondents rate their level of agreement with each item on a
7-point Likert scale from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very
strongly agree). Scores can range from 5 to 35 points. The Work
and Family Conflict Scale has strong concurrent validity and
demonstrates high internal consistency (>.90) and reliability.21
Six-Month Assessment
Participants were contacted via email 6 months into their in-
ternship year and asked to complete an online survey includ-
ing the PHQ-9 and the Work and Family Conflict Scale.
Statistical Analysis
Baselinedifferencesbetweenmenandwomenandbetweenre-
spondersandnonresponderstothe6-monthsurveywithrespect

conflict scores over time were assessed using paired t tests, and
sexdifferencesinchangeinwork-familyconflictscoreswereas-
sessed using independent sample t tests. A Pearson correlation
was used to quantify the association between changes in work-
family conflict and depression symptoms.
To investigate the extent to which depressive symptoms
changed over the first 6 months of the internship year and
whether sex differences exist in these changes, 2 general lin-
ear mixed models were constructed. These models are ideal
for modeling longitudinal data, as they are able to incorpo-
rate all available data, even for participants who only re-
sponded to the first (preinternship) survey. First, a model was
fit on the PHQ-9 scores as the dependent variable, using sex,
time, and the interaction between sex and time as indepen-
dent variables, along with age, relationship status (engaged or
married vs other), children (yes/no), and history of depres-
sion; this model was referred to as the minimally adjusted
model, or model 1. The model incorporated random inter-
cepts for participants to account for the fact that an indi-
vidual participant’
s responses over time tend to be corre-
lated. Next, to determine the extent to which sex differences
were confounded by work-family conflict, a model was con-
structed that was similar to the minimally adjusted model but
also included the time-varying covariates of work-family con-
flict score and all 2- and 3-way interaction terms involving
work-family conflict score with time and sex. This second
model was referred to as the fully adjusted model, or model
2. Comparing the sex difference estimates in the minimally ad-
justed and fully adjusted models helped provide a sense of the
extent to which the sex differences observed over time were
confounded by changes in work-family conflict. The fully ad-
justed model was also used to illustrate how PHQ-9 scores

the 75th percentile, corresponding to a work-family conflict
score of 23). All analyses were performed using SAS statisti-
cal software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Students matching into 23 medical and surgical specialties at
341 US institutions completed the preinternship assessment
(Table 1). Mean (SD) participant age was 27.5 (2.7) years, and
1571 participants (49.7%) were women. In comparison to
women,menweremorelikelytobemarriedorengaged(42.4%
vs 36.7%; P = .001) and have children (9.8% vs 6.5%; P = .001).
Women were more likely than men to report having a history
of depression (49.3% vs 41.8%; P < .001) (Table 2). A total of
2108 participants (68%) completed the 6-month survey.
Compared with those who did not respond to the 6-month
survey, responders were more likely to be women (51.7% vs
45.5%; P = .001) and be married or engaged (40.9% vs 36.9%;
P = .04) but were not different with respect to age and were
equally likely to have had children or have reported a history
of depression. Preinternship work-family conflict scores were
slightly lower among responders compared with nonre-
sponders (mean [SD], 18.8 [5.5] vs 19.3 [5.4]; P = .01).
Sex Differences in Work-Family Conflict
Among responders to the 6-month survey, mean (SD) work-
family conflict scores increased 19% from preinternship to
month6oftheinternshipyear(from18.78[5.53]to22.54[5.59];
P < .001). Prior to the start of the internship year, there were
no significant differences in mean (SD) work-family conflict
scores between women and men (19.0 [5.4] vs 18.6 [5.7], re-
spectively;P = .08);however,6monthsintotheinternshipyear,
mean (SD) work-family conflict scores were modestly but sig-
nificantly higher for women (22.8 [5.5]) compared with men
(22.2 [5.7]) (P = .01). The average increases over time in work-
familyconflictscoresweresimilar(P = .4)betweenwomen(in-
creases of 3.9 ± 6.1 points) and men (increases of 3.7 ± 6.3
points).
Sex Differences in Changes in Depression Scores Over Time
Resultsoftheminimallyandfullyadjustedgenerallinearmixed
models are presented in Table 3. The models demonstrate that
preinternshipdepressionscoresweresimilarbetweenmenand
women, with women’
s average scores just slightly higher than
men’
sscores.Forexample,model1indicatesthatwomen’
spre-
internship mean PHQ-9 depression scores were just 4% higher
than men’
s (2.79 vs 2.68), and when work-family conflict is ac-
counted for in model 2, this difference was essentially negli-
gible, with women’
s adjusted mean scores just 2% higher (2.96
vs 2.91). For both men and women, depression symptoms in-
creased substantially after 6 months of internship. Model 1 in-
dicated that this increase was equivalent to 2.50 points (a 93%
increase) on the PHQ-9 score among men, and 3.20 points
(a115%increase)amongwomen.Increasesinwork-familycon-
flict scores were statistically moderately correlated with in-
crease in PHQ-9 depression scores (ρ = 0.28; P < .001). After
adjusting for the potential confounding effect of changes in
work-family conflict in model 2, the increases in PHQ-9 scores
wereslightlyattenuated,withthepercentincreaseamongmen
and women being estimated to be 58% (1.69 to 2.91) and 72%
(2.13 to 2.96), respectively. Next, both models indicated that
the increases during the internship year in mean depression
scores were significantly higher for women when compared
with men. Specifically, the estimated sex-by-time interaction
in model 1 indicated that the increase among women was 0.70
points higher (95% CI, 0.37-1.04) than the increase among men
(3.20vs2.5;P < .001).Evenafteradjustingforchangesinwork-
family conflict, the estimated sex-by-time interaction term in
model2indicatedthattheincreaseindepressionscoresamong
women(2.13points)wasstillsignificantlyhigher(ie,0.45points
higher; 95% CI, 0.11-0.78; P < .01) than among men (1.69
points). By comparing the sex difference estimates (ie, the sex-
by-time interaction terms) in models 1 and 2, adjusting for
work-family conflict scores helped explain the sex difference
in changes in depression scores; specifically, the estimated sex
difference was 36% lower in model 2 (0.70 points vs 0.45
points).
The fully adjusted model also confirmed that increases in
work-family conflict during internship corresponded to sig-
nificant increases in PHQ-9 depression scores. Interestingly,
women whose work-family conflict score increased from 15 to
23 (ie, from the baseline 25th percentile to the 75th percen-

PHQ-9 score. On the other hand, men whose work-family con-
flict score increased to a similar degree had, on average, only
a 3.3-unit increase in their PHQ-9 score. This interaction be-
tweensex,time,andwork-familyconflictscores,however,was
moderately significant, providing further justification for its
inclusion in the fully adjusted model.
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analyses of the mixed models revealed that hav-
ing a partner and/or children did not impact the magnitude of
the relationship between work-family conflict and the sex dif-
ference in depressive symptoms.
Discussion
This study is the first that we know of to prospectively inves-
tigate sex differences in depressive symptoms and how work-
family conflict may impact the sex disparity in depressive
symptoms during the internship year. Prior to the start of their
internship year, men and women experience similar levels of
depressive symptoms and work-family conflict. For men and
women, depressive symptoms and work-family conflict in-
crease over the first 6 months of the internship year, and work-
family conflict is associated with elevated depressive symp-
toms. Women, in comparison with men, experience a greater
increase in depressive symptoms during the internship year;
however, when work-family conflict is accounted for, the sex
disparityindepressivesymptomsisreducedbymorethanone-
third (36%). These findings highlight the positive association
between work-family conflict and depressive symptoms and
may partly explain the sex disparity in depressive symptoms
among training physicians.
Studies explicitly examining sex differences in work-
family conflict have produced contradictory findings. Some
studies18,22,23 identify greater work-family conflict among fe-
male physicians compared with male physicians, while other
studies24-26 have found no sex effects. Differences in study
findings may be due to variation in study design, geographic
region, or stage of career. Only 1 prior study18 that we know of
has examined the role of work-family conflict among physi-
cians practicing in the United States. This cross-sectional
study18 indicated that female surgeons experience greater con-
flictbetweenworkandfamilyroles,whichwasassociatedwith
more burnout and depression compared with men. Our find-
ings build on this work by prospectively demonstrating that
sexdifferencesindepressivesymptomsemergeduringthefirst
6 months of the internship year, and that work-family con-
flict is associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms,
particularly for female physicians.
These findings suggest that changes to the medical sys-
tem that reduce work-family conflict have the potential to re-
duce depression among physicians. Given the consequences
of depression in physicians,1,6-9 any reduction in the depres-
sion burden could have broad benefits to both physicians and
their patients. Suicide, the most tragic consequence of depres-
sion, is more common in physicians compared with the gen-
eralpopulation.Malephysiciansare1.41timesandfemalephy-
sicians are 2.27 times more likely to die by suicide than their
counterparts in the general population.8 Interventions that re-
duce depression and suicide among physicians are sorely
needed.6-8,27
Prior work suggests that both depression and work-
family conflict can adversely impact physicians’careers. De-
pressed physicians are more likely to leave the medical
profession, reduce work hours, and change their specialty.5
Work-familyconflictamongphysicianscorrelatesstronglywith
low job satisfaction and increased burnout, which, in turn, ad-
versely impacts patient care and increases physicians’attri-
tion from the workforce.15,16,28 Given that patients of female
physicians have lower readmission and mortality rates than
patients of male physicians,29 efforts to reduce work-family
conflict may support retention of women in medicine and im-
prove patient outcomes. Further, the emergence of sex dis-
parities in depression during the internship year may be one

 reason why the representation of women decreases precipi-
tously as physicians progress up the academic ladder from
medical school (51%) to full-time faculty (38%) to full profes-
sor (21%), department chair (15%), and dean (16%).30 Efforts
to reduce work-family conflict have the potential to help with
the retention and advancement of women in medicine as well
as reduce depression among female physicians.
Pilot programs designed to ease work-family conflicts
among physicians through providing free home-delivered
meals, childcare, and housecleaning are in their infancy.31
Our findings suggest that these programs should be
expanded in scope and number and that they should be rig-
orously tested to see if they not only reduce work-family
conflict but also depression and its consequences, such as
physician suicide, poor quality of patient care, medical
errors, and career attrition.2-5,8
Limitations
There are limitations to our study. Depressive symptoms were
assessed through a self-report inventory rather than a diag-
nostic interview. We chose this method based on previous data
demonstrating that anonymity is necessary to accurately as-
certain depressive symptoms among medical professionals.32
Nonetheless, it would be important to validate these findings
using in-person interviews. Self-reported rates of lifetime his-
toryofdepression,asdefinedbytheDSM-V,amongfemaleand
male interns were 49.3% and 41.8%, respectively. These esti-
mates are quite high and may reflect the limitations of self-
reportassessments.Only61.0%ofinvitedinternsagreedtotake
part in our study, and among those, 68.0% completed the fol-
low-up assessment. While it is possible that the response pat-
tern biases our results, we do not find substantial differences
in demographic or mood-related variables between respond-
ers and nonresponders. Furthermore, our baseline and fol-
low-upsurveyresponseratesaresimilartoorhigherthanthose
of prior studies3-5,11,15,18 of interns and residents.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates that depressive symptoms increase
substantially during the internship year for men and women,
butthatthisincreaseisgreaterforwomen.Thestudyalsoiden-
tifies work-family conflict as an important potentially modi-
fiable factor associated with elevated depressive symptoms in
training physicians. Interventions aimed at reducing work-
family conflict may be an important step in reducing depres-
sive symptoms in physicians. Medical internships were de-
signed over 50 years ago, when aspiring physicians were
predominately men and often without family responsibili-
ties. Although women account for half of medical interns to-
day, the fundamental structure and function of medical train-
ing has not changed.33 More explicit consideration of work and
family responsibilities may be helpful in constructing a medi-
cal education system that allows for rigorous medical train-
ing and promotes good mental health.
