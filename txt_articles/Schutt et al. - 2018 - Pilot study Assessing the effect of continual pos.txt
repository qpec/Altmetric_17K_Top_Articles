Abstract
Aim: The study aim was to evaluate if continual patient position monitoring, taking 
into account self- 
turns and clinician- 
assisted turns, would increase the percentage of 
time a patient’s position changed at least every 2 hr.
Background: While patient turning has clinical benefits, current models to help staff 
remember to turn patients, such as “turn clocks” and timers, have not resulted in high 
compliance with turning protocols. In addition, reminders are based on arbitrary 2- 
hr 
windows (such as turning on “even” hours) rather than on individual patient activity, 
including self- 
turns.
Design: This is a first inpatient, non- 
randomized, pre- 
/postintervention study.
Methods: Data collection occurred from May 2013–February 2014 on a 39- 
bed medi-
cal unit in a community hospital. Baseline patient turning data were recorded by a 
sensor; however, the patient data were not displayed at the nurses’ station to establish 
compliance with the hospital’s turning protocol. Postintervention, patient position in-
formation was wirelessly displayed on nurses’ station computer monitors in real time. 
A Student t test was used to compare baseline to postintervention “mean time in 
compliance.”
Results: Data from 138 patients (N = 7,854 hr of monitoring) were collected. The 
baseline phase yielded 4,322 hr of position monitoring data and the postintervention 
phase yielded 3,532 hr of data. Statistically significant improvement was demon-
strated in the percentage of time a patient’s position changed at least every 2 hr from 
baseline to postintervention.

1 | INTRODUCTION
1.1 | Background
Turning patients is one of the most basic nursing care interventions 
to improve oxygenation (Marklew, 2006), help prevent skin break-
down (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), 2014) 
and improve circulation (Lippincott Advisor, 2015). Prior practices to 
help remind nursing staff to turn patients included visual reminders, 
such as a turning clock ((AHRQ), 2014). This regimented type of re-
minder is potentially ineffective and not patient- 
centric, as it does not 
account for patients’ self- 
turning. Other types of prompts have been 
used—such as signage or auditory alarms—that do not incorporate a 
 22  |    
SCHUTT eT al.
patient- 
specific approach ((AHRQ), 2014). The 2014 Clinical Practice 
Guidelines stress the need to consider individual patient needs (such 
as skin conditions and comfort) when planning repositioning fre-
quency (NPUAP, 2014). However, in deciding any turning protocol, 
the question of how nursing staff know a patient needs to be turned 
or has already turned remains, regardless of the standard or physician 
order for frequency of turning. This study sought to determine if con-
tinual position monitoring could increase compliance with a predeter-
mined turn protocol. National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) 
continues to support the guideline of turning patients every 2 hr to 
help prevent pressure ulcers and yet acknowledge that this is not al-
ways feasible (Black et al., 2011). The desire to reduce pressure ulcers 
is emphasized in hospitals as it is a nurse sensitive indicator. While 
there are multiple strategies that can help prevent pressure injuries, 
including moisture management, frequent turning and nutrition, this 
study sought to examine the ability to monitor patient movement, as 
a component of preventing skin breakdown.
A study of patients in elder care homes found that turning pro-
tocols of 2 hr compared with a 2- 
hr/4- 
hr combination did not statis-
tically significantly change the incidence of pressure ulcers (van der 
Wee, Grypdonck, DeBacquer, & Defloor, 2006). This study supports 
considering individual patient needs about turning. For the purpose of 
this study design, the turn frequency protocol against which compli-
ance was measured was 2 hr, as that was the study hospital’s nursing 
standard.
1.2 | Literature review
Schallom et al. (2005) found accomplishing turning every 2 hr is dif-
ficult, noting that although patients had an opportunity for 23 bi-
hourly turns in the observation period, the mean amount of turns 
was less than half that (Mean = 9.64, range 0–23). Schallom et al. 
(2005) was limited by the inability to monitor the patients for 24 hr 
continuously, so activity from 12 midnight to 8 a.m. was not ac-
counted for.
Patient safety about patients in isolation for infectious disease was 
also reviewed. A systematic review revealed that an increase in adverse 
events related to failure to care for patients consistently had a negative 
impact on isolation patient safety (Abad, Fearday, & Safdar, 2010).
While the practice of turning is widely considered essential in inpa-
tient care settings, the ability to monitor and assure the completion of 
this practice is problematic. NPUAP continues to support the guideline 
of turning patients every 2 hr to help prevent pressure ulcers yet agree 
it is not always feasible (Black et al., 2011).
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Participants
Eligible participants included adults of all mobility levels age 18 or 
over who met the inclusion criteria of: (i) hospitalized inpatients ex-
pected to remain on unit for at least 12 hr and (ii) able and willing to 
comply with study procedures.
Exclusion criteria were: (i) cognitive impairment or other men-
tal disability that would prevent the patient (or his/her agent) from 
providing written informed consent; (ii) known adhesive allergy or 
sensitivity; (iii) unable to place sensor on patient’s anterior torso; (iv) 
pregnancy or breast feeding; (v) presence of a pacemaker or implanted 
cardio- 
defibrillator (ICD); (vi) patients who refused to have their chest 
hair clipped if needed for proper sensor placement; and (vii) patients 
who had participated in another clinical study within the past 30 days.
Participants signed an informed consent form, HIPAA authorization 
form and California Subject Bill of Rights form. The monitoring system 
underwent verification and validation testing by the manufacturer, re-
ceived FDA 510(k) medical device clearance and was registered with 
clinicaltrials.gov. Once all documents were signed, the patient was en-
rolled in the study and a sensor was applied. Mobility was not a factor 
for inclusion or exclusion, as the study hospital has found that pressure 
injuries have occurred regardless of patients’ ambulation status.
2.1.1 | Method of recruitment
Daily unit status reports were generated and reviewed for patients 
who met the inclusion criteria. A research assistant (RA) interviewed 
patients who met the inclusion criteria for willingness and the ability 
to consent to participate in the trial.
2.1.2 | Recruitment setting
The study was completed on a 39- 
bed adult medical unit at a non- 
profit community hospital in Silicon Valley, California. This unit has 
three nurses’ stations. The patient–nurse ratio was 5:1 and nursing 
assistants were available on all shifts.
2.2 | Intervention
2.2.1 | Details of intervention
The intervention involved placing a wireless sensor on patients (Leaf 
Healthcare, Pleasanton, CA, USA) to collect patient position data and 
evaluate the percentage of time the patient’s position was changed 
within 2 hr. The system consists of a circular 1.5- 
inch disposable sen-
sor attached to a film dressing that is adhered to the skin over the pa-
tient’s sternal area, as well as a computer, server and monitor display. 
Once fully deployed, the monitor at the nurses’ stations displayed 
a colour- 
coded system used to identify patients who needed to be 
turned, as follows:
• a “green bar” indicated a patient was turned within the past hour 
and 45 min;
• a “yellow bar” indicated a patient was complying but required a turn 
in 15 min or less; and
• a “red bar” indicated a patient was overdue for a turn.
Variables measured. The study was divided into two phases. Patients 
were categorized as “isolation” or “no isolation.” Additionally, time was 
     |  23
SCHUTT eT al.
captured so the compliance evidence could be examined across a 24- 
hr 
period.
The baseline phase included:
• observation of the system by comparing the patient position trans-
mitted to the computer and visualization of the actual patient in the 
room; and
• using a sensor to measure each patient’s position every 10 s, with 
the information being transmitted wirelessly to a central server for 
analysis.
The postintervention phase included:
• using a sensor to measure each patient’s position every 10 s, with 
the information being transmitted wirelessly to a central server and 
the monitors at the nurses’ stations. Data were downloaded from 
the server for analysis.
RAs were responsible for:
• consenting patients;
• educating patients about the sensor itself and that their movements 
would be monitored;
• applying the sensor (which was mounted to an adhesive film dress-
ing) and ensuring sensors were worn continuously; and
• completing case report forms (CRFs) that included patients’ demo-
graphic and medical data. CRFs were updated until patients were 
discharged or transferred off the study unit.
Patients were offered no incentive to participate in the study. 
Patients were not specifically told the interval for compliance with turns 
was set at 2 hr. All protected health information (PHI) was transmitted as 
encrypted data and de- 
identified.
During this study, no other changes were made to the organi-
zation’s turning protocol, including how nurses document a missed 
patient turn in their notes (i.e. “patient refused”). After the baseline 
phase, nurses were told that the monitoring system could be used 
to determine if the hospital’s 2- 
hr turning standard was being ad-
hered to and that the visualization of which patient needed turning 
would help them triage their work. Nurses did not change their ex-
isting patient rounding practices of patient- 
centric care during this 
study.
2.3 | Objectives
The study questions were:
• Can the use of a wireless continual position monitoring system in-
crease the percentage of time a patient’s position changed within 
2 hr for patients on a medical unit?
• Can the use of a wireless continual position monitoring system in-
crease the percentage of time a patient’s position changed within 
2 hr for patients in isolation?
2.4 | Outcomes
Primary and secondary outcome measures. Measures used for the 
study are:
• “turn period,” defined as the “maximum amount of time that can 
elapse between patient turns”; for this study, the turn period was 
2 hr. The turn period automatically reset after an adequate patient 
turn (either caregiver-assisted or patient self-turn). While the sys-
tem captures all turns, it cannot differentiate between caregiver-as-
sisted turns or self-turns as it only monitors movement.
• “turn angle,” defined as “degree of patient rotation in a transverse 
plane in relation to their vertical axis.” In this study, the turn angle 
threshold was set to 20 degrees for all patients. Therefore, the turn 
angle threshold was right side: greater than +20 degrees; back: + 20 
to −20 degrees; and left side: less than −20 degrees.
• “decompression time,” defined as the “amount of time a body region 
(i.e. left, back or right) must be offloaded to be considered fully de-
compressed.” For this study, a decompression time of 15 min was 
used.
The monitor at the nurses’ station displays a “green bar” when a turn 
(self- 
turn or caregiver- 
assisted) met the defined thresholds for “turn 
angle” and “decompression time.”
2.4.1 | Data collection methods
Once consent was obtained, the patients were enrolled in the study 
and an RA applied a sensor to each patient’s sternal area and initiated 
data transmission.
Data for the study were collected on a centralized server that cap-
tured continual movements of all study patients every 10 s. Raw data 
from the patient sensors were imported into a custom reporting tool 
and analysed using Microsoft Excel™. Individual position data were 
then grouped and analysed in 1- 
hr increments.
2.4.2 | Validated instruments
The sensor module used a micro- 
electromechanical system (MEMS) 
accelerometer to measure each patient’s position, expressed to the 
user as a roll, tilt or upright angle. MEMS accelerometers have been 
used for over 30 years in several performance and safety- 
critical 
applications, including aeronautic navigation, hard disk protection 
mechanisms and automobile airbags. The accuracy of the sensor 
module is monitored throughout its design cycle using an angle 
gauge professionally calibrated by a third- 
party calibration com-
pany using National Institute of Standards and Technology trace-
able calibration equipment. Additionally, each sensor received a full 
functional validation test before being packaged for use. This func-
tional test included rotating the sensor along each of its axes to en-
sure proper functionality of its accelerometer and checks to ensure 
proper communication of its orientation data. The baseline phase 
of visual matching of the patient position and computer monitor/
 24  |    
SCHUTT eT al.
server display of patient position (right, back and left) was not kept 
in the testing documentation. Additional validation testing is per-
formed for each sensor software release and consists of monitoring 
a batch of sensors in a simulated environment reporting at 10× the 
normal rate until end- 
of- 
life.
2.5 | Sample size
A target of 63 patients was selected based on achieving a 95% confi-
dence interval, assuming a standard deviation of 0.5 and a margin of 
error of 12.3 percentage points. The following formula was used to 
calculate the estimated number of patients:
(n = target sample size, sd = standard deviation, e = margin of error).
Due to patient turnover on the unit, the baseline phase and postin-
tervention phase patients were not the same patients.
2.6 | Assignment method
All patients were considered for this convenience sample study. Any 
patient who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate was 
included.
2.7 | Blinding
As the patients needed to have a sensor applied, they were not 
blinded to the study. In the baseline phase, nurses were not specifi-
cally instructed as to what the sensor was monitoring.
2.8 | Unit of analysis
Data from the continual position monitoring sensor were transmitted 
every 10 s.
2.9 | Statistical methods
A t test was used to evaluate the difference in turn protocol com-
pliance between the baseline phase sample and the postintervention 
sample. “Compliance” was not measured as a categorical variable 
but rather as a per cent of variability, ranging anywhere from 0% to 
100% and therefore was a parametric variable. As the true standard 
deviation of the population was unknown and the sample size was 
expected to be relatively small, a t- 
score was selected over a z- 
score.
The turning protocol compliance rate for each patient was cal-
culated as described below. The individual turn protocol compliance 
for patients in the baseline and postintervention phases was calcu-
lated by dividing the sum of the “total time a patient was considered 
compliant with the turn protocol” by “total monitored time.” The av-
erage turn protocol compliance for all patients in the baseline and 
postintervention phases was calculated by dividing the “sum of the 
total time each patient in the phase was compliant with the turn 
protocol” by the “total monitored time.” A patient was considered in 
compliance if the sustained time on a given side (left, back or right) 
was less than the assigned turn period. During the postinterven-
tion phase, individual patient compliance was communicated to the 
nursing staff using a three- 
colour system. Patients who displayed 
green or yellow were compliant. Patients who displayed red were 
non- 
compliant.
All compliance calculations incorporated a 15- 
min grace period in 
the turn period. As all patients were on a 120- 
min turning protocol, 
there was no impact on compliance metrics until a patient accumu-
lated 135 min on one side. The grace period was incorporated into 
both the pre- 
intervention and postintervention compliance calcula-
tions. However, it was not considered when displaying the compliance 
state of patients during the intervention phase and nursing staff were 
not made aware of the grace period.
To identify trends and variability in the compliance rate, “adher-
ence to the turn protocol over time” was also analysed. Each phase 
was segmented into 100- 
hr monitoring intervals, which can consist 
of data from one or more patients. The percentage of time patients 
were 100% compliant for a given hour was then calculated for each 
consecutive block of 100 patient monitoring hours. The “turn pro-
tocol adherence” was calculated by taking the sum of hours with 
“100% turn protocol compliance” and dividing by “100 hr of mon-
itoring time.”
To monitor for changes in turning compliance throughout the day 
(and therefore by shift), the average compliance over the course of 
the study was calculated in 1- 
hr time blocks for each hour of the day. 
The average hourly compliance was calculated by summing the total 
number of hours patients were in compliance for each 1- 
hr time block 
divided by the total number of patient hours monitored for that time 
block. The “average hourly turn protocol compliance” was calculated 
by dividing the sum of “time in compliance with turn protocol per pa-
tient for a given hour interval each day” by “total time monitored per 
patient for a given hour interval each day.”
2.10 | Ethical considerations
The study was conducted according to the relevant and applicable 
regulations under U.S. Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 
812 and 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 and in accordance with local laws 
and regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from each 
patient prior to participation.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Participant flow
All patients admitted to the unit during the time of the study were 
screened by the study coordinator for obvious exclusion criteria. Those 
with no recognizable exclusions based on the chart review were ap-
proached for consent. No records were kept on any patient who 
appeared to qualify based on the chart review or on those who were ap-
proached for consent but did not enroll. See Figure 1 for participant flow.

Protocol deviations in the study included: lack of hair clipping 
before applying the sensor (N = 4); patient discharged with sensor 
still applied, necessitating phone call follow- 
up to check adverse 
events (N = 2); sensor fell off and was replaced by RN (N = 3); and 
sensor applied to patient who was later found to have a pacemaker 
(N = 1). The pacemaker patient was eliminated from the study 
as the sensor was removed within 1 hr; there were no adverse 
events.
3.2 | Recruitment
The project was submitted for review to the Institutional Review 
Board of the study hospital and was approved. Next, the wireless 
infrastructure/technology was tested and installed. The first patient 
was enrolled in May 2013 and the last was enrolled in February 2014. 
Data analysis commenced soon thereafter.
3.3 | Baseline data
Data for 138 patients across both phases were included in the 
analysis, representing 7,854 hr of position data. The baseline phase 
sample (N = 75) consisted of a different set of patients than did the 
postintervention phase sample (N = 63). Demographic information 
is displayed in Table 1. There were five isolation patients in each 
sample.
A chi- 
square test for independence was used to evaluate differ-
ences in gender between the baseline and postintervention samples. 
A p- 
value of .292 was obtained, indicating no statistical difference in 
gender between the two samples.
The average Braden scores for the baseline and postintervention 
sample populations were 20.8 and 19.9 respectively. p = .016 was ob-
tained using a two- 
tailed t test to evaluate the distribution of Braden 
scores between the two groups, indicating the postintervention group 
had a lower average Braden score by 0.9; the difference was signifi-
cant (p < .05).
3.4 | Numbers analysed
In both groups, patient data were collected and analysed continuously 
throughout the entire time a patient was wearing the sensor (the 
“wear time” of the patient sensor).
3.5 | Outcomes and estimation
The t test results indicate that using a wireless continual position 
monitoring system statistically significantly increased the percent-
age of time a patient’s position was changed within 2 hr (64%–98%,

p < .001). T test results also revealed the use of a wireless continual 
position monitoring system statistically significantly increased the 
percentage of time a patient’s position was changed within 2 hr for 
patients in isolation (48%–99%, p = .030).
Figure 2 displays the turn protocol adherence comparison—base-
line vs. postintervention. T test results revealed lower baseline phase 
turn adherence of 39%–89% (average 64%) compared with postin-
tervention phase turn adherence of 86%–100% (Mean 98%). The 
improvement in turn protocol adherence was statistically significant 
(p < .001).
There are instances when required turns cannot be performed 
(i.e. clinical circumstances, patient refusal, patient being off unit). If 
the caregiver documented a valid reason a required turn could not 
be performed (captured through chart audit of nurses’ notes by an 
RA), the missed turn did not have a negative impact on compliance 
calculations.
3.6 | Ancillary analyses
Figure 3 displays the average hourly turning compliance, reflecting 
cyclical changes that occur in turn adherence over 24 hr. After imple-
mentation of the monitoring system, cyclical variation decreased and 
the compliance rate was higher at all hours of the day.
3.7 | Adverse events
During the study, a small number of patients (N = 2) experienced mild 
temporary skin irritation believed to be related to the adhesive on the 
film dressing used to attach the sensor to the sternal area. The RAs, 
who were Registered Nurses, made the initial assessment of skin ir-
ritation. All incidences of skin irritation (N = 2) were reported to the 
physician principle investigator. Both patients with skin irritation were 
followed and the irritation resolved without additional intervention. 
As these two cases of mild skin irritation self- 
resolved, this was not 
felt to be a barrier to product use.
The film dressing for adherence of the patient sensor was se-
lected because it is a common dressing used in the study hospital 
for IV dressings without any significant report of patient skin irrita-
tion. The literature review revealed the prevalence of adverse skin 
reactions is “unknown, as official figures are unavailable and where 
they do exist are thought to be unreliable” (Conway & Whettam, 
2002). There was one study where film dressings were compared 
with pressure dressings for postpercutaneous transluminal coronary 
angiography patients; one patient in a sample of 35 was found to 
have skin irritation (McIe, Pettite, Pride, Leeper, & Ostrow, 2009). 
This present study also found very low incidence of skin irritation 
with film dressings.

4 | DISCUSSION
4.1 | Interpretation
For the first time, a continual position monitoring system was used to 
accurately and objectively measure compliance with patient turning 
protocols. The baseline compliance at the study hospital, as objectively 
determined by continuous position monitoring, was consistent with 
previous studies (Tucker, 2009 and Voz, Williams, & Wilson, 2011). 
The baseline phase sample benefitted from the electronic health record 
worklist reminders to turn patients, yet still had compliance of 64% with 
2- 
hr turning. This finding demonstrates that electronic reminders did 
not yield a high compliance with turning protocols at the study hospital.
Traditionally, turning protocols have taken a “one size fits all” ap-
proach that is not patient- 
centred. Continual position monitoring tech-
nology may enable nursing staff to better individualize patient care in 
response to the national push towards a patient- 
centred healthcare 
model. Given that the system continually tracks patient movement, 
credit is given for any adequate patient self- 
turns; thus, the system may 
prevent unnecessary work and patient disruptions and improve staff 
efficiency. When nursing staff noticed on the monitor that a patient 
turn was required (i.e. the turn “bar” had become red), a notification was 
provided to the primary nurse and/or nursing assistant so the patient 
could be turned as soon as possible. An administrative support person 
(“unit clerk”) often watched the monitor at the main nursing station 
near where she answered phones and call lights and was able to inform 
the nurse or nursing assistant that a turn was needed. An informal, non- 
scientific questionnaire was given to nursing staff during the baseline 
phase and again in the postintervention phase for anonymous feedback 
on the continual position monitoring system. In the postintervention 
phase questionnaire, 87% (41 of 47) of the nursing staff felt the contin-
ual position monitoring system was helpful. The nurses said the system 
helped them prioritize patient care and avoid unnecessary tasks.
By turning patients every 2 hr on a “set schedule” (i.e. turn on even 
hours), there is a risk of turning a patient to a position they had just 
recently turned away from themselves. The continual position mon-
itoring system allows nursing staff to know the length of time in a 
position and to plan care accordingly.
There were limitations in terms of the sample size and sample 
equality of the two phases. The data collection period for the baseline 
phase was approximately four times as long as the postintervention 
phase due to slower enrolment rates in the baseline phase. There was 
only one RA during the baseline phase, thus causing slower enrolment. 
During the postintervention phase, additional RAs were hired to speed 
the enrolment process. While the number of patients was similar be-
tween the two phases, the data for the baseline group were collected 
over a period of 18 weeks and that for the intervention group were 
collected over a period of 4 weeks. Therefore, the baseline phase had 
fewer patients monitored per day than the postintervention phase.
The methodology chosen to calculate compliance was developed 
by the research team because there was no standard method avail-
able. Although there could be other methods, the research team be-
lieved the chosen definition was most consistent with the practical 
expectations of what constitutes compliance.
This study was non- 
randomized and non- 
blinded. Given that the 
intervention under investigation required a clinical process change and 
the adoption of new procedures, it was not possible to randomize pa-
tients or staff. Although the lack of randomization makes it harder to 
rule out confounding variables, efforts were made to ensure no other 
policies or process changes were introduced during the study period. 
About blinding, due to the baseline and postintervention nature of the 
study, it was not possible to blind nursing staff.
In terms of assessing the baseline turning protocol compliance, ef-
forts were made to minimize the introduction of observer effect bias. 
Although the nursing staff was not explicitly made aware of the nature 
of the study, it is difficult to estimate the degree to which the Hawthorne 
effect may have artificially increased our baseline turning compliance.
The primary outcome measure of this study was to determine if 
continual position monitoring could increase the percentage of time 
a patient’s position changed within 2 hr. It was believed that the in-
crease was achieved by taking into account the patient’s own abilities 
for self- 
turning and clinical turning, thereby personalizing while priori-
tizing patients’ care needs.
Goldhill, Badacsonyi, Goldhill, and Waldmann (2008) supported 
the need to develop a better understanding of patient turning and the 
associated clinical benefits. The authors found the average time be-
tween turns was 4.85 hr (N = 393) with no statistical difference in a 
variety of demographics, including gender, age, intubation status and 
sedation. They also reported that 42% of patients were turned in 2 hr 
or less and that turning patients regularly can have various potential 
benefits, including decreased muscle wasting, improved lung capacity 
and decreased pressure- 
related skin issues (Goldhill et al., 2008).
Future studies should include replication with a larger sample 
size to evaluate patient care processes and clinical outcomes, such as 
pressure ulcers, clot formation and respiratory status, beyond simply 
turning compliance. While no patients who were part of this study de-
veloped a pressure ulcer while participating, a larger sample size would 
be better to evaluate the incidence of pressure ulcers when using the 
monitoring system. A larger sample size could also increase the num-
ber of isolation patients studied to evaluate the turning compliance 
changes for that patient population. Additional studies could examine 
variables of Braden category score for mobility and activity in com-
parison to self- 
turning. This could help determine if patients who are 
highly mobile and active also self- 
turn while in bed. Studies outside 
of California would also be beneficial due to percentage of RN staff-
ing variability, beyond the California state- 
mandated nurse- 
to- 
patient 
ratios which leads to a higher percentage of RNs on medical- 
surgical 
units.
There was a serendipitous finding in the study about a morbidly 
obese patient who needed more pillows to stay in the side- 
lying po-
sition than the nursing staff had originally placed. This was noted due 
to the monitoring system not crediting an offloading turn based on 
the 20% angle turn system requirement. The patient had “sunk back” 
so far into the original pillows that the 20% turn change had not been 
maintained and the system “bar” returned to red. This finding suggests 
knowledge could be gained through future study of continual position-
ing monitoring of morbidly obese patients.

Future studies could also include patient experience, nursing sat-
isfaction with the system and more evaluation of the challenges of 
accurately offloading data for extremely obese patients.
4.2 | Generalizability
This study was conducted on one medical unit in a community hospi-
tal in Silicon Valley, California, thus limiting its generalizability. Future 
studies would need to replicate the study in different settings, such 
as academic institutions and in different states where the nurse- 
to- 
patient ratio is not mandated. The study should also be replicated with 
different patient populations, such as intensive care patients, postsur-
gical patients and/or long- 
term care patients.
4.3 | Overall evidence
The display of patient movement data at the nurses’ stations ena-
bled nurses to identify patients who were self- 
turning and patients 
who were in need of assisted turns. The enhanced ability to un-
derstand patient positioning could have potential benefits in terms 
of patient safety, the prevention of falls and pressure ulcers and 
more accurate triaging of patient care needs with regard to patient 
turning.
