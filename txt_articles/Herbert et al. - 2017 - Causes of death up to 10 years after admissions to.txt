Summary 
25 
 
26 
Background: Emergency hospital admission with adversity-related injury (self-inflicted, 
27 
drug/alcohol-related, violent) affects 4% of 10-19 year olds. Their risk of death in the 
28 
decade after discharge is twice as high compared to adolescents hospitalised for accident-
29 
related injury. We determined how cause of death varied between these groups. 
30 
Methods: We compared risks of death in five causal groups (suicide, drug/alcohol-related, 
31 
homicide, accidental, ‘other’) up to ten years after discharge following adversity-related or 
32 
accident-related injury. We used linked hospital admission (to the National Health Service) 
33 
and mortality data for England (1997-2012) to determine cause-specific risks of death for 
34 
10-19 year olds, and to compare risks between adversity- and accident-related index injury 
35 
after adjustment for age-group, socio-economic status, and chronic conditions. 
36 
Findings: Among 333,009 adolescents admitted with adversity-related injury (girls 
37 
181,926, boys 181,053), and 649,818 with accident-related injury (girls 166,462, boys 
38 
483,356), 4,782 died in the ten years post-discharge (girls 1,312, boys 3,470). Adolescents 
39 
discharged after adversity-related injury had higher risks of suicide and of drug/alcohol-
40 
related death in the next decade than after accident-related injury (adjusted hazard ratios 
41 
[aHRs] varied from 3·2 [95% CI: 2·7, 3·6] for suicide in boys to 4·7 [3·3, 6·8] for 
42 
drug/alcohol-related death in girls). Risks of suicide were increased following self-inflicted 
43 
injury, drug/alcohol related injury, and violent injury (e.g. boys, aHR: 6·2 [5·3, 7·3], 4·5 
44 
[3·9, 5·2], 1·4 [1·2, 1·8], respectively vs. accident-related injury). Following each type of 
45 
index injury, risks of suicide and risks of drug/alcohol-related death were increased by 
46 
similar magnitudes (e.g. boys with self-inflicted injury vs. accident-related injury, aHR of 
47 
suicide: 6·2 [5·3, 7·3], drug/alcohol-related injury death: 5·9 [5·0, 7·0]).  
48 
Interpretation: Risks of suicide increased after all types of adversity-related injury, as did 
49 
risks of drug/alcohol-related death by a similar magnitude. Current practice to reduce risks 
50 
of harm after self-inflicted injury should be extended to drug/alcohol-related and violent 
51 
injury in adolescence. Prevention should address the substantial risks of drug/alcohol-
52 
related death alongside risks of suicide.

Introduction 
56 
Evidence from population-based cohort studies suggests that different types of 
57 
‘adversity-related injury’ (self-inflicted [including poisonings], drug/alcohol-related, or 
58 
violent injury) during adolescence are associated with similar underlying psychosocial 
59 
problems, including adverse experiences (e.g. maltreatment), poor mental health (e.g. 
60 
anxiety, depression), and poor social circumstances (e.g. poverty).1-3 Among the 4% of 
61 
adolescents (10-19 year olds) who are admitted to hospital with one of these types of 
62 
adversity-related injury in England, approximately three-quarters of girls and one-third 
63 
of boys are admitted with injuries related to multiple types of adversity.4 Despite this 
64 
apparent overlap between self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related, and violent injury, most 
65 
research in these adolescents has focused on specific types of adversity-related injury. 
66 
A previous study of adolescents admitted to hospital in England as an emergency with 
67 
any adversity-related injury reported that 1 in 136 girls (7·3 per 1,000) and 1 in 64 boys 
68 
(15·6 per 1,000) died within the ten years after discharge, and that these risks were 
69 
similar whether the initial injury was self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related, or violent.5 
70 
These ten-year risks were approximately twice the risks for adolescents discharged after 
71 
accident-related injury (girls 3·8 per 1,000 and boys: 6·0 per 1,000) or for the general 
72 
population of adolescents (girls 3·0 and boys: 3·0).  
73 
 
74 
Despite common underlying psychosocial problems and elevated mortality risks among 
75 
adolescents with any of these three types of adversity-related injury, UK national 
76 
clinical guidelines recommend different approaches to psychosocial assessment and 
77 
intervention to reduce future harm.6-8 For example, guidelines for managing self-
78 
inflicted injury presenting to hospital recommend admission of patients younger than 
79 
16 years and assessment of psychosocial circumstances and suicide risk at all ages.6,7 
80 
Guidelines for drug- or alcohol- related presentations do not specifically address 
81 
psychosocial needs of adolescents.8 No UK guidelines exist for responding to violent 
82 
injury. A further issue is that clinical management to reduce the risk of further harm 
83 
after self-inflicted injury focuses on risks of recurrent self-harm, despite evidence for 
84 
increased risks of other adverse outcomes.9 A cohort study of 15-24 year olds 
85 
presenting to a hospital in Oxford with self-inflicted injury in 1978-1997 reported 
86 
increased mortality due to respiratory disorders, circulatory disorders, and accidents, as 
87 
  
4 
well as suicide, during the subsequent 20 years.9 No comparable estimates have been 
88 
published for risks of harm following drug/alcohol-related or violent injury (see panel 
89 
‘Research in Context’). 
90 
 
91 
This study aims to inform preventive strategies for reducing risks of future harm for 
92 
adolescents who are discharged from hospital after self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related, 
93 
or violent injury. Given standard practice to reduce risks of repeated self-harm or 
94 
suicide after discharge following self-inflicted injury, we examined, for girls and boys 
95 
separately, whether risks of suicide difference between adolescents discharged 
96 
following drug/alcohol-related and violent injury. Second, among girls and boys 
97 
respectively, we compared risks of cause-specific death (suicide, drug/alcohol-related, 
98 
homicide, accidental, and other) up to ten years from discharge after each type of index 
99 
injury, including accident-related injury. 
100 
 
101 
 
102 
Methods 
103 
Study design 
104 
We used Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, which contain all emergency (acute, 
105 
unplanned) admissions to the National Health Service (NHS) in England (April 1997-
106 
March 2012), including to independent sector providers paid for by the NHS.10 
107 
Approximately 98-99% of hospital activity in England is funded by the NHS,11 and so 
108 
these data captured nearly all admitted adolescents. As we used a standard, de-identified 
109 
HES extract from NHS Digital (formerly known as the Health and Social Care 
110 
Information Centre), ethics approval was not required.12 
111 
We derived a cohort of adolescents (aged 10-19 years inclusive) who were admitted for 
112 
injury (the index injury), and categorised them as ‘adversity-related injury’ (comprising 
113 
non-mutually exclusive groups of self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related, or violent injury; 
114 
irrespective of whether the injury was also accident-related) or ‘accident-related injury’ 
115 
(where there was no recorded adversity-related injury). Therefore, adversity-related 
116 
injury and accident-related injury were two mutually exclusive groups. Deaths within 
117 
the cohort were evaluated in five ‘causal’ groups: suicide, drug/alcohol-related, 
118 
  
5 
homicide, accidental, or ‘other’. We compared risks of death (total and by cause) up to 
119 
ten years following discharge from admission for adversity-related injury (exposure) 
120 
with risks after accident-related injury (comparator).  
121 
 
122 
 
123 
We excluded adolescents who did not have sex recorded (885; 0·08%), died during the 
124 
index admission (1,877; 0·17%), had no valid discharge date (372; 0·03%), or were 
125 
admitted with injury related to neither adversity nor accidents (94,407; 8·9%; the 
126 
majority of these latter adolescents were admitted primarily for chronic conditions or 
127 
complications of surgery).4  
128 
Study cohort and exposures 
129 
Self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related, violent, and accident-related injuries were 
130 
identified using ICD-10 codes in HES data (i.e. characteristics that were identified and 
131 
recorded by clinicians). Details of classification of injury and descriptive statistics of 
132 
the cohort have been reported elsewhere.4,5 Briefly, 333,009 adolescents who had at 
133 
least one adversity-related injury (181,926 girls, 151,083 boys; 20·3% and 24·0% of 
134 
which had an injury that was also accident-related), and 649,818 with at least one 
135 
accident-related injury but no adversity-related injury (166,462 girls, 483,356 boys) 
136 
were identified (Supplementary Figure S1).5  
137 
 
138 
Table 1 shows that the most frequent type of injury among girls and boys was 
139 
drug/alcohol-related followed by self-inflicted injury in girls and violent injury in boys. 
140 
We have previously reported that the peak age group for adversity-related injury was 
141 
15-17 years old for girls (47%) and 18-19 years old for boys (46%), but for accident-
142 
related injury it was 10-14 years for girls (62%) and boys (54%). Compared with 
143 
adolescents admitted with accident-related injury, those admitted for adversity-related 
144 
injury were more likely to be in the in the most deprived category, or to have a chronic 
145 
condition recorded in the past year in hospital records (Herbert et al 2015, Table 1).5  
146

147 
Outcomes 
148 
The primary outcome was cause-specific death between one day and ten years after 
149 
discharge from the index injury admission. We identified deaths using Office for 
150 
National Statistics (ONS) mortality data linked to HES (within NHS Digital). We used 
151 
any ICD-9 or -10 codes in the mortality data (based on the underlying and up to 15 
152 
other contributing causes recorded in the death certificate) to categorise deaths into five 
153 
‘causal’ groups (Supplementary Table S1). As Figure 1 illustrates, suicide, 
154 
drug/alcohol-related, and homicide were not mutually exclusive, but these three groups 
155 
(i.e. adversity-related deaths), accidental (no codes for adversity-related death, but 
156 
codes for accidental causes) and ‘other’ deaths (no codes for adversity-related or 
157 
accidental deaths) were mutually exclusive. As advised by the ONS, undetermined 
158 
causes of death (codes E980-E989, Y1-Y34; n=483) were classified as suicide 
159 
(accounting for 38·1% of all suicides).13 Deaths with codes indicating an adjourned 
160 
inquest (U50·9; n=130) were categorised as homicide (80·2% of all homicides).  
161 
 
162 
Demographic and clinical factors 
163 
Covariates were included in the analyses, based on previous findings of their 
164 
relationship with adversity-related injury and death, including sex, age, socio-economic 
165 
status (SES), and chronic conditions.5 Age was grouped (10-15, 16-17, 18-19 years) to 
166 
reflect different recommendations in UK national guidelines for management of self-
167 
harm or alcohol misuse according to age, and different stages of social development.6-
168 
8 SES was categorised according to Index of Multiple Deprivation scores based on 
169 
residential postcode,14 using quintile cut-off values for England. An adolescent was 
170 
classified as having an underlying chronic condition if HES records for the index injury 
171 
admission or any admissions in the previous year included one of a cluster of ICD-10 
172 
codes for chronic conditions (Hardelid et al, 2013; Appendix Table 6·3·2).15 Of the 
173 
117,453 adolescents with adversity-related or accident-related injury who had a chronic 
174 
condition, 93,592 (79·7%) had a physical condition (data not shown). The most 
175 
common physical condition was chronic respiratory disorder (e.g. asthma, 39·8% to 
176 
55·4% by sex and type of injury).5  
177 
  
7 
 
178 
Statistical analyses 
179 
All analyses were conducted in Stata/SE 12 (StataCorp), and separately for girls and 
180 
boys.  
181 
 
182 
We first derived numbers (and proportions) of deaths (total and by cause) in the ten 
183 
years post-discharge after adversity-related (self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related, or 
184 
violent) or accident-related index injury. As statistical disclosure rules required us not 
185 
to publish counts <10 we did not present exact numbers of homicides for certain groups. 
186 
 
187 
We determined unadjusted cumulative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 
188 
deaths for each cause of death over the ten years following discharge from the index 
189 
injury admission, using the number of adolescents discharged alive after each type of 
190 
index injury as the denominator. The cumulative risk of death by cause of death was 
191 
estimated as a cumulative incidence function, which accounted for other ‘competing’ 
192 
causes (e.g. for suicide, competing causes included homicide, drug/alcohol-related, 
193 
accidental and other).16 For reference, we present unadjusted ten-year cumulative risks 
194 
and 95% CIs by cause of death and type of index injury, sex, and age-group 
195 
(Supplementary Table S2). We also estimated total and cause-specific risks of death for 
196 
the general population of 10-19 year olds in England in 1997-2012, using publicly 
197 
available ONS life-tables for total mortality and suicide, and bespoke life-tables for 
198 
drug/alcohol-related and accidental deaths provided to us by the ONS (according to 
199 
ICD codes in Supplementary Table S1).17 -19  
200 
 
201 
We fitted Fine & Gray models16 to estimate the relative risks of total and cause-specific 
202 
mortality following adversity-related index injury, adjusted for covariates and taking 
203 
into account competing risks of other causal groups. The exposure was type of index 
204 
injury, and covariates included age-group, SES, and chronic condition status. ‘Sub-
205 
hazard ratios’ (SHRs) of each cause of death were estimated for adversity-related injury 
206 
(vs. accident-related injury), age-groups 16-17 and 18-19 years (vs. 10-15 years), each 
207 
level of SES (vs. least deprived), and chronic condition (vs. none). To compare risks 
208 
following each type of adversity-related injury, we fitted the models as above but where 
209 
  
8 
the exposure was self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related, and violent injury, respectively 
210 
(each vs. accident-related injury).  
211 
 
212 
Finally, we assessed whether the finding that increased risks of suicide and 
213 
drug/alcohol-related deaths following self-inflicted or drug/alcohol-related injury was 
214 
due to the ‘overlap’ between these two types of index injury (73% of girls and 44% of 
215 
boys with either type had both types),5 or the overlap between suicide and drug/alcohol-
216 
related deaths (~12% of deaths that were either suicide or drug/alcohol-related, were 
217 
both [Figure 2]). We fitted the Fine & Gray models as above, but where the exposure 
218 
was the three different combinations of self-inflicted and drug/alcohol-related injury 
219 
(vs. accident-related injury), and the outcome was suicide, drug/alcohol-related death, 
220 
and each combination of these types of death, respectively (further details within 
221 
footnotes of Supplementary Table S3). 
222 
 
223 
We checked model assumptions using log-log plots of the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 
224 
the survival function and the link test, and assessed their goodness-of-fit using plots of 
225 
the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard function against Cox-Snell 
226 
residuals.16 
227

229 
Results 
230 
By ten years after discharge from admission for the index injury, there were 2,415 
231 
deaths (girls 873, boys 1,542) after adversity-related injury and 2,367 deaths (girls 439, 
232 
boys 1,928) after accident-related injury (Figure 1, Table 1). After adversity-related 
233 
index injury, nearly two-thirds (63·9%, n=1,046) of the deaths were related to suicide, 
234 
drug/alcohol use, or homicide, compared with only one-third (33·6%, n=796) after 
235 
accident-related index injury (Figure 1, Table 1). The proportions of deaths related to 
236 
suicide, drug/alcohol use, or homicide, respectively, were also higher after admission 
237 
for adversity-related injury compared with after accident-related injury (Figure 1, Table 
238 
1). The proportions of deaths related to suicide, drug/alcohol use, or homicide were 
239 
similar between girls and boys after adversity-related injury (girls 59·3% [n=518], boys 
240 
66·5% [n=1,025]), but lower for girls than boys after accident-related injury (girls 
241 
  
9 
19·4% [n=85], boys 36·9% [n=711]) (Table 1). The most frequent causes of death after 
242 
accident-related index injury were ‘other’ (overall 37�1% [n=877]; girls 59·2% 
243 
[n=260], boys 32·0% [n=617]) and accidental (29·3% [n=694]; girls 21·4% [n=94], 
244 
boys 31·1% [n=600]) (Figure 1, Table 1). 
245 
 
246 
Two thirds of all accidental deaths, 67·8% (n=759) were recorded as transport 
247 
accidents; this proportion did not differ according to type of index admission (data not 
248 
shown). Among deaths due to other causes, the most common causes were related to 
249 
neurological conditions (30·9%, n=473) or cancer/blood disorders (25·1%, n=384; of 
250 
nine possible groups of ICD codes relating to systems within the body).15 
251 
 
252 
Risks of total and cause-specific deaths by type of index injury 
253 
Adversity-related vs. accident-related index injury 
254 
Ten-year cumulative risks of total death after adversity related index injury were 7·3 
255 
per 1,000 (or 1 per 137) girls (95% CI: 6·8 to 7·8 per 1,000) and 15·6 per 1,000 (or 1 
256 
per 64) boys (14·8 to 16·4 per 1,000) (Figure 2, Supplementary Table S2). Cumulative 
257 
risks were lower after accident-related index injury (girls 3·7 per 1,000, 3·4 to 4·1; boys 
258 
6·0, 5·7 to 6·3).  
259 
 
260 
The increased risks of death after an adversity-related compared with accident-related 
261 
injury were due to substantially higher risks of suicides and drug/alcohol-related deaths 
262 
at all time-points after the index injury (Figure 2). After adjustment for other covariates, 
263 
risks of suicides and drug/alcohol-related deaths were three to five times higher 
264 
following discharge from adversity-related injury admission (Table 2). 
265 
 
266 
Self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related, and violent index injury 
267 
Ten-year risks of suicide were similar after hospital discharge following self-inflicted 
268 
index injury and drug/alcohol-related index injury (girls 2·9 vs. 2·5 per 1,000; boys 9·8 
269 
vs. 7·2; Figure 3, Supplementary Table S2). Compared with adolescents discharged 
270 
after accident-related injury, risks of suicide were increased five- to six-fold for 
271 
  
10 
adolescents discharged after self-inflicted or drug/alcohol-related injury (Table 3 shows 
272 
sub-hazard ratios adjusted for covariates; e.g. for boys the adjusted SHR of suicide after 
273 
self-inflicted injury was 6·20 [5·27, 7·30] and after drug/alcohol-related injury 4·51 
274 
[3·89, 5·24]). Risks of suicide were increased after self-inflicted and after drug/alcohol-
275 
related injury, whether the index injury was for either one of these types of injury only, 
276 
or both (Supplementary Table S3; i.e. comparing between rows, per sex). 
277 
 
278 
Ten-year risks of suicide and of drug/alcohol-related death were similar after each type 
279 
of index injury. These risks were highest after self-inflicted or drug/alcohol-related 
280 
index injury (Figure 3; Supplementary Table S2). For example, after self-inflicted 
281 
injury, the ten-year risk of suicide for girls was 2·9 per 1,000, whereas the ten-year risk 
282 
of drug/alcohol-related death was 2·7 per 1,000 (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S2). 
283 
After adjustment for covariates, the increased risks of suicide after self-inflicted and 
284 
after drug/alcohol-related index injury (vs. accident-related injury) were similar to the 
285 
risks of drug/alcohol-related death. For example, among boys discharged after self-
286 
inflicted injury compared with after accident-related injury, the adjusted SHR was 6·20 
287 
[5·27, 7·30] for suicide and 5·91 [4·96, 7·03], for drug/alcohol-related death) (Table 
288 
3). These adjusted SHRs were similar whether the death was related to suicide but not 
289 
drugs/alcohol, drugs/alcohol but not suicide, or both causes (Supplementary Table S3; 
290 
i.e. comparing between columns). 
291 
 
292 
Socio-demographic and clinical covariates  
293 
Boys aged 18-19 years who were discharged after self-inflicted injury or drug/alcohol-
294 
related injury had the highest risks of death due to any cause (ten-year risks: 30·4 per 
295 
1,000, or 1 per 33, after self-inflicted injury, 25·1 per 1,000, or 1 per 40, after 
296 
drug/alcohol related injury; Supplementary Table S2). These risks were substantially 
297 
higher than after accident-related injury (8·8 per 1,000) or for the general population of 
298 
18-19 year old boys (8·9 per 1,000). These risks were driven by high risks of suicide 
299 
and drug/alcohol-related death.  
300 
 
301 
Adolescents aged 18-19 years had twice the mortality risk compared with 10-15 year 
302 
olds, due to increased risks of suicide and drug/alcohol-related deaths among older 
303 
  
11 
girls and boys, and increased risks of accidental deaths among older boys (Table 2; 
304 
Table 3). Low SES (i.e. most deprived) was associated with increased risks of total 
305 
and cause-specific mortality, apart from suicide in boys, in whom low SES was 
306 
associated with a decreased risk of suicide.  
307 
Adolescents with a chronic condition (vs. none) had a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of 
308 
death due to any cause, and a 10- to 12-fold increased risk of death due to causes other 
309 
than adversity or accidents, regardless of the type of index injury (Table 2). For 
310 
example, for 18-19 year old boys discharged after an adversity-related index injury, the 
311 
ten-year risk of death due to any cause was 37·5 per 1,000 given a chronic condition 
312 
and 14·8 per 1,000 given none (data not shown). For 18-19 year old boys discharged 
313 
after accident-related injury, these risks were 17·5 and 8·8 per 1,000 respectively. 
314 
 
315 
Discussion 
316 
This retrospective cohort study determined cause-specific risks of death up to ten years 
317 
after adolescents were discharged from the NHS in England following injury related to 
318 
‘adversity’ (self-harm, drug/alcohol misuse, violence) or accidents. Within ten years 
319 
after discharge following adversity-related injury 1 per 137 girls and 1 per 63 boys had 
320 
died. We found that suicide, drug/alcohol-related deaths, and a small number of 
321 
homicides accounted for 61% of all deaths ten years after adversity-related injury, but 
322 
only 35% of deaths after accident-related injury. Second, we showed that risks of 
323 
suicide were all increased following self-inflicted injury, drug/alcohol-related injury, 
324 
and following violent injury. These risks were highest for 18-19 year old boys. Third, 
325 
the risks of suicide were similar to those of drug/alcohol-related deaths regardless of 
326 
whether the adversity-related index injury was self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related, or 
327 
violent. Fourth, adolescents with an underlying chronic condition at the index injury 
328 
admission (10-15%)5 were at increased risk of all causes of death, independently of the 
329 
type of adversity or accident-related injury or age at admission. 
330 
 
331 
  
12 
Strengths and limitations 
332 
The main strength of our study is the use of linked NHS emergency admissions and 
333 
mortality data, which included all injury admissions in England linked to subsequent 
334 
mortality reacords in England and Wales over 15 years.13 The population-based cohort 
335 
of nearly one million 10-19 year olds allowed us to compare risks of cause-specific 
336 
mortality between different types of index injury admissions. We used time-to-event 
337 
statistical methods to estimate risks whilst taking into account censoring of outcomes 
338 
and competing risks of different causes of death.16 Although we combined index injury 
339 
admissions across a 15-year period, our conclusions were not sensitive to calendar 
340 
period (e.g. boys in 1997, adjusted SHR of suicide for adversity-related vs. accident-
341 
related injury [95% CI]: 2·6 [1·7, 3·9]; corresponding SHR for boys in 2012: 3·2 [2·2, 
342 
4.7]; data not shown). 
343 
 
344 
One limitation is that ICD codes used to define adversity-related injury and deaths tend 
345 
to have high specificity but low sensitivity.20-22 The potential misclassification of 
346 
exposure (i.e. self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related, or violent injury, misclassified as 
347 
accident-related injury) and outcomes (i.e. suicide, drug/alcohol-related deaths, or 
348 
homicides, misclassified as accidental or other deaths) may induce bias in the estimates 
349 
of their associations, which is likely to under-estimate the increased risks of suicide and 
350 
drug/alcohol-related deaths after adversity-related injury relative to after accident-
351 
related injury. To minimise this potential bias we included codes for undetermined 
352 
intent and adjourned inquests in the definitions of suicide and homicide, respectively. 
353 
The prevalence of chronic conditions recorded by codes at the index injury admission 
354 
or at hospitalisation during the previous year may be under-ascertained, particularly to 
355 
the presence of chronic mental health conditions. 
356 
 
357 
A further limitation is potential linkage error between HES and ONS mortality data. 
358 
One of the few studies that have investigated linkage errors in HES data showed high 
359 
missed match rates (4.1%) that were higher for males and ethnic minorities.22 Linkage 
360 
error between HES and ONS mortality data would favour underestimation of mortality 
361 
rates.22 Lastly, the study was likely under-powered to detect differences in the risks of 
362 
homicide between index injury groups.  
363 
  
13 
 
364 
Comparison with other studies 
365 
Our main finding of similar increases in risks of suicide death following self-inflicted 
366 
injury and following drug/alcohol related injury has not been previously reported. We 
367 
report lower ten-year risks of death after admission for self-inflicted injury (girls: 7.7 
368 
per 1,000, boys: 24.1 per 1,000; Supplementary Table S2) than the 20-year mortality 
369 
rates after presentation with self-inflicted injury reported by Hawton et al (girls: 17 per 
370 
1,000, boys: 50 per 1,000).9 These differences may be because Hawton et al studied 
371 
young people aged 15-25 years and determined mortality after 20 years of follow up. 
372 
In Hawton et al’s study, 60·0% of deaths in girls and 45·6% of those in boys were from 
373 
suicide (including deaths of undetermined intent and drug/alcohol-related suicides),9 
374 
compared with 39·8% and 43·2% in our study (Table 1). 
375 
 
376 
Implications for practice, policy, and research 
377 
Our findings suggest that specialist psychosocial assessment by a child and adolescent 
378 
mental health professional, which is part of recommended standard practice for self-
379 
inflicted injury in the UK, should be considered for adolescents presenting with 
380 
drug/alcohol-related or violent injury. The need for a consistent approach targeting all 
381 
three adversity-related injury groups is supported by previous evidence of their 
382 
common underlying psychosocial problems, the overlap among the same admitted 
383 
adolescents,4 and similar patterns of risky behaviours into young adulthood, particularly 
384 
relating to self-harm and drug/alcohol use.24-26 Clinical and public health strategies need 
385 
to be extended to include reducing risks of death related to drugs/alcohol, which are 
386 
just as high as risks of suicide death. If it were possible to completely eradicate the 
387 
excess mortality risk associated with adversity-related injury among hospitalised 
388 
adolescents, we could have expected 857 fewer suicide and drug/alcohol-related deaths 
389 
in our cohort (girls: 392 [219 drug/alcohol-related deaths], boys: 683 [394]; based on 
390 
the estimated relative risks in Table 2). Among 16-19 year olds, the burden of suicides 
391 
in the decade after adversity-related injury represented approximately 10-25% of 
392 
suicides expected in the general population during the same follow-up (based on ten-
393 
year risks in Supplementary Table S2, and ~3-4% of the general population of 16-19 
394 
year olds admitted with adversity-related injury).4 
395 
  
14 
 
396 
Findings from the current study are likely to be generalisable to other UK countries, 
397 
where rates of hospitalisations during adolescence for adversity-related injury and 
398 
mortality through intentional injuries are similar.27, 15 Generalisation to non-UK settings 
399 
requires further research. 
400 
 
401 
There is a need for investment in interventions for reducing harm after all types of 
402 
adversity-related injury, whether self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related, or violent. Risks 
403 
of death are substantially increased in adolescents admitted with chronic conditions, 
404 
and appropriate effective interventions may differ for this sub-group. There is a lack 
405 
of evidence to determine how public health bodies and services can reduce or 
406 
ameliorate risks of long-term harm after adversity-related injury in adolescence.28-30 
407 
Interventions need to be developed and evaluated in randomised controlled trials to 
408 
enable services to respond effectively and appropriately.

Panel: Research in context 
561 
Systematic review 
562 
We searched for studies (including reviews) of cause-specific death after hospital 
563 
attendance for any adversity-related injury published from Jan 1995-May 2016. We 
564 
searched Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science using terms 
565 
‘’adolescents’’, ‘’injury’’, ‘’hospital’’, ‘’self-harm’’, ‘’drug or alcohol use’’, 
566 
‘’violence’’, and ‘’mortality’’. We found six studies (seven articles), but no relevant 
567 
systematic review. Five (European) studies reported risks of death due to suicide, and 
568 
some also reported risks of deaths due to drug/alcohol use (n=2), homicide (n=2), 
569 
undetermined/accidental causes (n=3), and chronic conditions (n=3), in up to 15 years 
570 
after adolescents presented to hospital with self-inflicted injury. One (US) study 
571 
reported frequencies of deaths from homicide, drug overdose, and traffic accidents in 
572 
the two years after discharge following violent injury in 559 adolescents. We did not 
573 
identify any studies that reported rates of cause-specific death following hospital 
574 
presentation or admission for drug/alcohol-related injury, or compared risks of cause-
575 
specific deaths after discharge following any adversity-related injury with those 
576 
following accident-related injury.  
577 
Interpretation 
578 
Our study adds new evidence on the risks of cause-specific death up to ten years after 
579 
discharge following adversity-related and accident-related injury among young 
580 
people. Our finding of elevated risks of suicide following all types of adversity-
581 
related injury (versus accident-related injury) suggests that clinical and public health 
582 
strategies need to be extended to reduce harm after all types of adversity-related 
583 
injury, whether self-inflicted, drug/alcohol-related or violent. Similar risks of suicide 
584 
and drug/alcohol-related deaths following discharge from any type of index injury 
585 
found in our study also stress the need of preventive strategies, both within and 
586 
outside the healthcare sector, to reduce public health burden of suicide and 
587 
drug/alcohol-related deaths.
