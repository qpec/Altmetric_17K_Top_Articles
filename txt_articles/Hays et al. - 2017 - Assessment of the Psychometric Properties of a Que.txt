IMPORTANCE Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures for laser in situ keratomileusis
(LASIK) are needed.
OBJECTIVE To develop PRO measures to assess satisfaction, eye-related symptoms, and their
effect on functioning and well-being following LASIK based on patient and expert input.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Patient-Reported Outcomes With LASIK (PROWL)
studies were prospective observational studies of patients undergoing LASIK surgery for
myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism. PROWL-1 was a single-center study of active-duty US
Navy personnel and PROWL-2 was a 5-center study of civilians. PROWL-1 enrolled 262
active-duty service personnel and PROWL-2 enrolled 312 civilians 21 years or older who spoke
English; 241 individuals in PROWL-1 and 280 in PROWL-2 completed a baseline questionnaire
before surgery. The analytic sample included those also completing 1 or more follow-up
questionnaires: 240 (99.6%) of those in PROWL-1 and 271 (94.4%) of those in PROWL-2.
Questionnaires were self-administered through the internet preoperatively and at 1 and 3
months postoperatively in both studies and at 6 months postoperatively in PROWL-1.
PROWL-1 began in August 2011 and was completed May 30, 2014; PROWL-2 began in July
2012 and was completed June 27, 2014. Data were analyzed from June 28, 2014, to October
24, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Scales assessing visual symptoms (double images, glare,
halos, and starbursts), dry eye symptoms, satisfaction with vision, and satisfaction with LASIK
surgery. Items from the National Eye Institute (NEI) Refractive Error Quality of Life Instrument
(NEI-RQL-42), NEI Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ), and the Ocular Surface Disease
Index (OSDI) were included. All scales are scored on a 0 to 100 possible range. Construct
validity and responsiveness to change were evaluated (comparing scores before and after
surgery).
RESULTS The median age of the 240-person PROWL-1 analytic sample was 27 years (range,
21-52 years); 49 were women (20.4%). The median age of the 271-person PROWL-2 analytic
sample was 30 years (range, 21-57 years); 147 were women (54.2%). Internal consistency
reliabilities for the 4 visual symptom scales ranged from 0.96 to 0.98 in PROWL-1 and from
0.95 to 0.97 in PROWL-2. The median (interquartile range) test-retest intraclass correlation
was 0.69 (0.57-0.79) and 0.76 (0.68-0.84) in PROWL-1 and PROWL-2, respectively.
Product-moment correlations of satisfaction with surgery with visual symptom scales at
follow-up evaluations ranged from r = 0.24 to r = 0.49. Measures improved from baseline to
follow-up, with effect sizes of 0.14 to 1.98, but scores on the NEI-RQL-42 glare scale
worsened at the 1-month follow-up. Hours of work did not change significantly from baseline
to 1-month follow-up, with the mean number (mean [SD] difference) in PROWL-1 of 41.7 vs
40.9 hours (−0.8 [18.7]) and in PROWL-2 of 38.8 vs 38.2 hours (−0.6 [17.1]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of these studies support the reliability and validity
of visual symptom scales to evaluate the effects of LASIK surgery in future studies.

L
aser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is a refractive cor-
neal surgical procedure for reducing or eliminating myo-
pia, hyperopia, and astigmatism.1,2 The US Food and
Drug Administration evaluates the safety and effectiveness of
LASIKdevicesbeforeapprovingthemforuseintheUSmarket.3
Dry eye symptoms, dissatisfaction with visual outcomes, and
burdensome visual symptoms have been reported following
LASIK.4,5 Given the high volume of surgery performed and pa-
tient concerns voiced at a public meeting, it is important to
evaluate the effect of surgically induced changes on patient-
reported outcomes (PROs) of LASIK: eye-related symptoms,
daily functioning and well-being (health-related quality of life
[HRQOL]), and patient satisfaction.6-8 A better understand-
ing of PROs after LASIK may allow eye care professionals and
patients to make more educated decisions. Thus, a reliable and
valid PRO instrument is needed to evaluate the effects of this
intervention.9
ThePatient-ReportedOutcomesWithLASIK(PROWL)proj-
ect team developed a questionnaire to evaluate PROs for per-
sons undergoing LASIK for myopia, hyperopia, or astigma-
tism, incorporating existing HRQOL measures and developing
new items. This article summarizes the psychometric perfor-
mance of the instrument in 2 studies of participants undergo-
ing LASIK surgery.
Methods
Study Design
We conducted a literature search and obtained input from an
expert panel of ophthalmologists, optometrists, psychome-
tricians,andclinicalresearchers.Draftitemswererevisedbased
on input from patients who underwent LASIK and another
group of experts. In addition, 9 individuals contemplating LA-
SIK surgery and 9 who had LASIK surgery performed be-
tween 6 months and 2 years ago participated in interviews in
Los Angeles, California, and Washington, DC. Four of the post-
LASIK participants were satisfied and 4 were dissatisfied with
the results of LASIK surgery (1 unknown). These interviews
were used to assess item redundancy, content coverage, re-
call period, instructions, and format, and to revise items for
the PROWL studies.
The PROWL-1 study protocol was approved by the Naval
Medical Center San Diego Institutional Review Board (IRB) in
compliance with all applicable federal regulations governing
the protection of human participants. The PROWL-2 study was
conducted under the US Food and Drug Administration Re-
search Involving Human Subjects Committee, a central IRB for
3 sites (20/20 Institute, Indianapolis, Indiana; Durrrie Vision,
Overland Park, Kansas; and Vance Thompson Vision, Sioux
Falls, South Dakota), and university IRBs for 2 sites (The Johns
Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland; and Stanford Uni-
versity, Stanford, California). All participants provided writ-
ten as well as oral informed consent. There was no financial
compensation in PROWL-1; PROWL-2 participants received
compensation. The PROWL studies are registered at Clinical-
trials.gov (NCT0152629 and NCT01655420 for PROWL-1 and
PROWL-2, respectively). Both studies were compliant with the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and com-
plied with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.10
PROWL-1 and PROWL-2 were prospective observational
studies. Both enrolled patients planning to undergo LASIK sur-
gery for myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism. Investigators
screened, enrolled, and treated study participants with LA-
SIK surgery and followed up participants postoperatively ac-
cording to their usual clinical practice. PROWL-1 was a single-
center study of active-duty Navy military personnel; PROWL-2
was a 5-center study of civilians. Participants completed the
questionnaires preoperatively and at 1 and 3 months after sur-
gery using a secure website accessed from any computer.
PROWL-1 had an additional 6-month postoperative visit with
questionnaire administration. PROWL-1 began in August 2011
and was completed May 30, 2014; PROWL-2 began in July 2012
and was completed June 27, 2014. Data were analyzed from
June 28, 2014, to October 24, 2016.
Participant Selection
Participants were 21 years or older, spoke and read English flu-
ently, had not previously received any form of refractive sur-
gery, and were determined to be good candidates for LASIK
based on the surgeon’
s assessment of medical and ophthal-
mic health, cognitive function, and physical and social limi-
tations. A random subsample completed the questionnaire
twice before surgery within a 3- to 14-day interval.

PROWL-2
PROWL-2 enrolled patients with a targeted refraction of bilat-
eral emmetropia. To obtain a sample that reflected the refrac-
tive range of the LASIK-treated population, each site over-
sampled participants with higher refractive errors, including
hyperopic participants with a spherical equivalent of equal to
or greater than +1.50 D and myopic participants with a spheri-
cal equivalent more myopic than −7.00 D. Three strata were
Key Points
Question What are the psychometric properties of a
patient-reported outcome instrument to assess eye-related
symptoms and their effect on functioning and well-being following
laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)?
Findings The Patient-Reported Outcomes With LASIK (PROWL)
studies (PROWL-1 and PROWL-2) were prospective observational
studies evaluating a total of 574 patients undergoing LASIK
surgery for myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism. The study results
support the reliability and validity of these patient-reported
outcome measures for use in evaluating LASIK surgery.
Meaning These studies yield support for use of the PROWL
survey in future studies to assess the effects of LASIK surgery on
functioning and well-being.

created based on spherical equivalent: more hyperopic than
+1.50 D, between +1.50 D and −7.00 D, and more myopic than
−7.00 D. Site enrollment was capped at 45 individuals with
spherical equivalents between −7.00 D and +1.50 D until either
18 participants had enrolled in the other 2 strata or 105 days
of enrollment had passed. After 105 days, enrollment was
opened without restriction by strata.
Clinical Procedures and Measures
CentersperformedtheLASIKprocedureandpostoperativecare
based on the clinical judgment of the surgeons. The protocol
did not dictate the care of participants, but it specified the col-
lectionofmedical,ophthalmic,andsurgicalhistory;visualacu-
ity, slitlamp, and posterior segment ocular examination find-
ings; surgical factors; and postoperative clinical assessments.
Questionnaire
The questionnaire included new items to assess satisfaction
with current vision (1 item), satisfaction with LASIK surgery
(8 items), and the existence, bothersomeness, and effect on
usual activities in the past 7 days of 4 key visual symptoms
using polytomous response options: double images (8 items),
glare(8items),halos(8items),andstarbursts(8items).Weused
a written definition of the symptom and images to illustrate
symptom severity levels.
The questionnaire also included items from the National
Eye Institute (NEI) Refractive Error Quality of Life Instru-
ment with 42 items (NEI-RQL-42),11,12 the NEI Visual Func-
tion Questionnaire with 25 items (NEI-VFQ-25),13,14 and the
Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI).15 All scales are scored on
a 0 to 100 possible range. NEI-RQL-42 scales, NEI-VFQ driv-
ing scale, visual symptoms scales, and satisfaction with vi-
sion are scored such that a higher score is better; OSDI is scored
such that a higher score is worse. Potential threats to the va-
lidity of the HRQOL measures were evaluated by assessing op-
timism (Life Orientation Test-Revised),16 health proneness
(Brien Holden Vision Institute Quality of Life Scale for
Myopia),17 anxiety and depressive symptoms (Patient Health
Questionnaire-4),18 socially desirable response set,19 and ex-
pectations about spectacle use and vision after surgery (6
items).Thequestionsandrationalefortheirselectionareavail-
able in eMethods and eTables 1-11 in the Supplement.
The PROWL-1 preoperative (baseline) version of the ques-
tionnaireincluded161itemsandthepostoperativeversioncon-
tained129items.ThePROWL-2baselinequestionnairehad154
items and the postoperative questionnaire included 112 items.
Statistical Analysis
The analytic sample comprised individuals who completed a
baseline and at least 1 follow-up questionnaire. Correlations
of items with the scale that they represented were estimated
and compared with correlations of items with other scales.20
For these item-scale correlations, we imputed missing item re-
sponses using maximum likelihood estimates of the covari-
ance matrix via the expectation-maximization algorithm in
SAS, version 9.4.21 We evaluated multi-item scales, including
the OSDI dry eye symptoms and environmental triggers (8
items),NEI-RQL-42clarityofvision(4items),NEI-RQL-42near
vision (4 items), NEI-RQL-42 far vision (5 items), NEI-RQL-42
glare (2 items), NEI-RQL-42 diurnal vision (2 items), NEI-
RQL-42 activity limitations (4 items), NEI-RQL-42 worry (2
items), new items for satisfaction with surgery (8 items), and
new symptom items developed for the study: glare (8 items),
starbursts (8 items), halos (8 items), and double images (8
items).
We estimated descriptive statistics and internal consis-
tency reliability (coefficient α) for multi-item scales. The sub-
sample with repeated questionnaire administrations within 14
days was used to estimate test-retest correlations (product-
momentandintraclass).Reliabilitycoefficientsof0.70orabove
were considered adequate for group-level comparisons.22
We evaluated construct validity, using product-moment
correlationsofvisionsymptomscoreswiththesatisfactionwith
LASIK surgery scale (hypothesizing statistically significant,
positiveassociations)andexpectationsaboutspectacleuseand
vision after surgery, optimism, health proneness, depression
and anxiety symptoms, and socially desirable responses (hy-
pothesizing nonsignificant correlations). Responsiveness to
change was assessed by computing change scores, effect size
(changeinscoresdividedbySDatbaseline),and2-tailed,paired
t tests of the significance of change. We hypothesized that
changes over time would be statistically significant and rep-
resent improvement in HRQOL (except for possibly worsen-
ing glare and dry eye symptoms). Results were considered sta-
tistically significant if the probability was P ≤ .05. Because the
number of significant effects is inflated by change, we inter-
preted our results with this in mind.

Participant Characteristics
Table 1 summarizes baseline characteristics of enrolled par-
ticipants (262 in PROWL-1 and 312 in PROWL-2) and the ana-
lytic sample (240 [99.6% response rate] in PROWL-1 and 271
[94.4% response rate] in PROWL-2 among those eligible for the
study). The most common reason participants were not in-
cluded in the analytic sample was not having LASIK surgery
(eFigure in the Supplement).
The median age of the 240 PROWL-1 respondents was 27
years (range, 21-52 years). Most participants were non-
Hispanic white (54.6%), with 20.0% Hispanic, 9.2% non-
Hispanic black, 9.2% non-Hispanic Asian, and 6.3% who self-
identified as being other race/ethnicity; 20.4% were women.
PROWL-2 did not include participants in the analytic sample
if they did not complete the preoperative questionnaire (n = 5)
ordidnotcompleteapostoperativequestionnaire(n = 16).The
median age of the 271 PROWL-2 respondents was 30 years
(range,21-57years).Mostparticipantswerenon-Hispanicwhite
(76.4%), with 3.7% Hispanic, 1.8% non-Hispanic black, 12.2%
non-Hispanic Asian, and 5.5% who self-identified as other;
54.2% were women.

Scale Descriptive Statistics and Reliability Estimates
Table 2 provides baseline scale descriptive statistics and reli-
ability estimates. For most scales, a higher score indicated bet-
ter HRQOL. Exceptions were the OSDI symptom and environ-
ment scales, where higher scores indicated worse symptoms.
Ceiling effects (indicating healthiest possible responses) were
noteworthy(≥40%)fortheNEI-RQL-42diurnalvisionscaleand
for the visual symptoms scales (double images, glare, halos,
and starbursts).
Reliabilities (Cronbach coefficient α) ranged from 0.55
(NEI-RQL-42 glare scale) to 0.98 (new visual symptoms glare
scale) in PROWL-1 and 0.65 (NEI-RQL-42 glare scale) to 0.97
(new visual symptoms glare, starbursts, and halos scales) in
PROWL-2. The α values for other multi-item scales were as
follows in PROWL-1 and PROWL-2, respectively: expectations
about spectacle independence and vision clarity (6 items: 0.61
and 0.63), optimism (6 items: 0.77 and 0.81), health prone-
ness (10 items: 0.85 and 0.84), Patient Health Questionnaire-4
(4 items: 0.80 and 0.81), and socially desirable response set
(2 items: 0.56 and 0.51). At the 1-month postoperative assess-
ment, α levels for satisfaction with surgery (8 items) were
0.90 for PROWL-1 and 0.91 for PROWL-2. Test-retest product-
moment correlations over a mean interval of 10.74 (3.94)
days in PROWL-1 ranged from 0.33 (hours worked) to 0.80
(NEI-RQL-42 clarity of vision and activity limitations) and,
over a mean (SD) interval of 6.34 (3.04) days in PROWL-2
ranged from 0.54 (hours worked) to 0.93 (NEI-RQL-42 far
vision). The median (interquartile range) test-retest intraclass
correlation was 0.69 (0.57-0.79) in PROWL-1 and 0.76 (0.68-
0.84) in PROWL-2.

The 2 largest correlations among scales at baseline (eTable
3 in the Supplement) were between the NEI-RQL-42 far vi-
sion and the NEI-VFQ-25 driving scales (PROWL-1, r = 0.81;
PROWL-2, r = 0.85) and between the visual symptoms scales
of starbursts and halos (r = 0.63 and r = 0.70, respectively).
Construct Validity
Correlations of the new visual symptom measures with satis-
faction with surgery were statistically significant in the hy-
pothesized direction: glare (r = 0.34 at 1 month, r = 0.36 at 3
months, and r = 0.43 at 6 months in PROWL-1; r = 0.40 at 1
month and r = 0.33 at 3 months in PROWL-2), starbursts
(r = 0.27 at 1 month, r = 0.24 at 3 months, and r = 0.32 at 6
months in PROWL-1; r = 0.36 at 1 month and r = 0.36 at 3
months in PROWL-2), halos (r = 0.37 at 1 month, r = 0.34 at 3
months, and r = 0.49 at 6 months in PROWL-1; r = 0.38 at 1
month and r = 0.33 at 3 months in PROWL-2), and double im-
ages (r = 0.43 at 1 month, r = 0.37 at 3 months, and r = 0.39 at
6 months in PROWL-1; r = 0.29 at 1 month and r = 0.48 at 3
months in PROWL-2).
Correlations between baseline expectations of spectacle
use and vision with satisfaction with surgery at 1 and 3 months
in both studies and at 6 months in PROWL-1 were not signifi-
cant. The correlation of baseline health proneness with satis-
faction with surgery at 3 months was statistically significant
but small in magnitude (r = 0.14, P = .04 in PROWL-1 and
r = 0.13, P = .04 in PROWL-2). The Patient Health Question-
naire-4 depressive/anxiety score at baseline was significantly
associated with satisfaction with surgery at 6 months in
PROWL-2, but was small in magnitude (r = −0.19, P = .004).
The correlations of satisfaction with surgery with socially de-
sirable response set were small in PROWL-1 (r = 0.13, P = .47
at 1 month and r = 0.15, P = .29 at 3 months) and not signifi-
cant in PROWL-2 (r = 0.08, P = .17 at 1 month and r = 0.05,
P = .46 at 3 months).
Change From Baseline to Follow-up
Changesfrombaselineto1month(Table3),3months(Table4),
and 6 months (Table 5) postoperatively are reported. As hy-
pothesized, most of the measures improved significantly in
both studies from baseline to the 1-month follow-up, but hours
worked, OSDI environment scale, and 2 visual symptoms (star-
bursts and halos) did not change in either study and the new
visual symptoms glare scale did not change in PROWL-1. The
NEI-RQL-42glarescalescoresignificantlyworsenedfrombase-
line to 1 month postoperatively in both studies.
At the 3-month follow-up, every measure improved sig-
nificantly except that there was no change from baseline for
the NEI-RQL-42 glare scale and hours worked in both studies
and for the OSDI environment scale in PROWL-1. At the
6-month follow-up (PROWL-1), all measures improved signifi-
cantly from baseline with 2 exceptions: hours worked and the
OSDI environment scale.
The magnitude of change in PROWL-1 ranged from 0.14
baseline SD (OSDI symptom scale) to 1.86 SD (satisfaction with
vision)at1month,0.17SD(halossymptomscale)to1.95SD(sat-
isfaction with vision) at 3 months, and 0.20 SD (NEI-RQL-42
glare scale) to 1.98 SD (satisfaction with vision) at 6 months.
Magnitude of change in PROWL-2 ranged from 0.14 SD (NEI-
RQL-42 clarity of vision) to 1.25 SD (satisfaction with vision)
at1monthand0.19SD(halosscale)to1.34SD(satisfactionwith
vision) at 3 months. Repeated-measures analyses that in-
cluded baseline and all follow-up data in a single model pro-
duced results similar to those reported here.
Discussion
This study provides support for the reliability and validity of
the HRQOL instrument administered in the PROWL studies for
patients undergoing LASIK surgery. Content validity was en-
hanced by input from patients who underwent LASIK and cli-
niciansduringdevelopmentofthenewitems.23Item-scalecor-
relations indicated that the items were almost always more
highly correlated with the scale they were intended to repre-
sent than with other scales. Reliability estimates exceeded the
0.70 threshold for adequate reliability for most of the mea-
sures. In addition, correlations among the scales indicated that
they yield distinct information about HRQOL. Moreover, the
HRQOL measures were significantly positively correlated with
patient satisfaction with LASIK surgery, consistent with a pre-
vious study.24 The measures were uncorrelated or weakly as-
sociated with socially desirable response set, health prone-
ness(coping),optimism,depressiveand/oranxietysymptoms,
and expectations of spectacle use and vision.
Responsiveness to change was supported by improve-
mentsinalmosteveryHRQOLmeasurefrombaselinetofollow-
up. The NEI-RQL-42 glare scale showed increases in glare at 1
month in both PROWL-1 and PROWL-2 and reduction in glare
at 6 months in PROWL-1. Differences from baseline for all other
follow-up times were not found. A previous evaluation of 185
patients before and 4 months after surgical correction of my-
opic or hyperopic refractive error found increases in glare
among myopes.12 Unlike the NEI-RQL-42, the new glare items
included a definition that focused solely on glare, as well as
an image showing graded severity. We found significant im-
provements(lessglare)onthenewvisualsymptomsglarescale
at 1 month in PROWL-2, 3 months in PROWL-1 and PROWL-2,
and 6 months in PROWL-1.
Limitations and Strengths
Inferences about the prevalence of the symptoms are limited
by oversampling of high myopes and hyperopes. In addition,
whether the changes observed persist beyond the time inter-
vals studied is unknown. Furthermore, PROWL studies were
limited to English-language participants. Administering the
questionnaire to people whose English differs from US Eng-
lish or whose primary language is not English would require
translationandassessmentofthelinguisticandculturalequiva-
lence relative to the original English-language questionnaire.
Moreover, associations of the PROs with visual acuity were
small or not significant and using acuity as a clinical and/or was
not supported. Finally, caution in drawing conclusions is war-
ranted because of the multiple statistical tests performed.
Despite these limitations, most eligible patients were
included in the analysis (99.6% in PROWL-1 and 95% in

PROWL-2), which is notably better than most surveys.25 The
results of PROWL-1 and PROWL-2 were consistent. The new
visual symptom items provide a potentially valuable ap-
proach that couples images with definitions and facilitates re-
ports about the impact of surgery. Eight questions for each
symptom were used to assess frequency, bother, and diffi-
culty doing usual activities when and when not wearing vi-
sion correction. Estimates of the minimally important differ-

reported results (eTables 10 and 11 in the Supplement).
The web-based administration of questionnaires, which
allowed for questionnaire completion outside of the clinical
visit, facilitated the conduct of the clinical studies by remov-
ing 1 level of data entry and potentially provided the partici-
pants more anonymity in their responses. Most study partici-
pants reported that completing the questions by computer was
easier than it would have been to do so by paper.26
Conclusions
The PROWL studies provided support for the reliability and va-
lidity of most scales included in the questionnaire for evaluat-
ing the effect of LASIK surgery. The newly created measures to
assesssatisfactionwithLASIKsurgeryanddoubleimages,glare,
halos, and starbursts supplement the existing OSDI symptoms
scale, NEI-RQL-42 scales (clarity of vision, near vision, far vi-
sion,diurnalvision,activitylimitation,andworry),andtheNEI-
VFQ-25 driving scale. This collection of measures can be used
tohelpprovideestimatesoftheprevalenceofsymptoms,func-
tioning, and well-being in future studies evaluating LASIK de-
vices. We recommend use of the new visual symptoms scales,
the satisfaction with LASIK surgery scale, and the satisfaction
with vision item in future studies. These newly created scales
in the PROWL questionnaire could be used to measure impor-
tant visual symptoms that occur following LASIK.
