Summary
Aims:
This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the associations
between shift work patterns and risks of specific types of obesity.
Methods:
PubMed was searched until March 2017 for observational studies that
examined the relationships between shift work patterns and obesity. Odds ratio for
obesity was extracted using a fixed-effects or random-effects model. Subgroup
meta-analyses were carried out for study design, specific obesity types and
characteristics of shift work pattern.
Results:
A total of 28 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The overall
odds ratio of night shift work was 1.23 (95% confidence interval = 1.17–1.29)
for risk of obesity/overweight. Cross-sectional studies showed a higher risk of
1.26 than those with the cohort design (risk ratio = 1.10). Shift workers had a
higher frequency of developing abdominal obesity (odds ratio = 1.35) than other
obesity types. Permanent night workers demonstrated a 29% higher risk than
rotating shift workers (odds ratio 1.43 vs. 1.14).
Conclusion:
This meta-analysis confirmed the risks of night shift work for the
development of overweight and obesity with a potential gradient association
suggested, especially for abdominal obesity. Modification of working schedules is
recommended, particularly for prolonged permanent night work. More accurate
and detailed measurements on shift work patterns should be conducted in future
research.
Keywords: Abdominal obesity, meta-analysis, obesity, shift work.
Abbreviations: 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; BMI, body mass index; OR,
odds ratio.
Introduction
Shift
work
schedules
are
becoming
popular
among
employees because of the high demand for flexibility and
productivity in workforces in modern society. Globally, ap-
proximately 20% of the overall workforce (1) is engaged in
a shift work pattern, which is equivalent to nearly 0.7 bil-
lion workers (2). Shift work has recently been identified as
an important occupational hazard, with a growing body
of evidence showing an association between shift work
and adverse health effects such as metabolism abnormalities
that include obesity (3–5). Obesity constitutes one of the
components of the metabolic syndrome, which is positively
associated with the development of several cancers, such as
breast cancer (6–10) and cardiovascular diseases (11,12).
Overweight and obesity have been regarded as a keynoted
health issue with a combined prevalence over 70% in
Western populations (13). Although its prevalence is lower
at around 18% for Chinese populations (14), it has been
rapidly increasing over the past two decades (15).
Several reviews have been conducted to investigate the
association between night shift work and obesity. Antunes

 et al. summarized the chronobiological aspects of shift
work with regard to obesity and identified disruption of
circadian rhythms as a critical mechanism underlying the
development of obesity (16). This disruption together with
sleep deprivation could lead to metabolic disorders (17). A
systematic review by Esquirol et al. described obesity as
one of the negative components of cardiovascular risk fac-
tors that were linked to shift work (18). Other systematic
reviews have demonstrated that shift work not only had
a negative impact on obesity risk (19) but also was
strongly associated with weight gain (20). Until now, none
of these previous systematic reviews examined the com-
bined risk estimates for the association between shift work
and obesity or overweight. Shift work may pose additional
risk for abdominal obesity, characterized as a central adi-
pose body shape that may be associated with increased
mortality, comparing with other obesity types (21). How-
ever, the results from original studies have been inconsis-
tent
or
lacked
statistical
power
(22–30).
There
are
variations in the characteristics and arrangements of night
shift work among different industries and companies,
which leads to potential difficulties in the overall risk as-
sessment. A better understanding of the knowledge gaps
regarding the associations between specific obesity types
and different types of shift work has important implica-
tions for guiding occupational health practice and disease
prevention. By pooling risk estimates from individual stud-
ies, this study aims to address this identified knowledge
gap by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis
to summarize the current state of evidence on the associa-
tions of different characteristics of shift work with specific
obesity types and weight gains.
Methods
Search strategy and inclusion criteria of literature
Two authors (M. S. and L. A. T.) searched the PubMed
database and independently reviewed potential studies
for inclusion, and any discrepancy encountered was re-
solved by consensus. ‘Shift work’ and ‘Obesity’ and ‘Shift
work’ and ‘Overweight’ were used as medical subject
heading terms. References cited in the targeted articles
were also searched manually. Studies that met all of the
following criteria were included in this study: (i) reported
an association between shift work and the risk of obesity,
overweight, body mass index (BMI) change or weight
change; (ii) described the definition of obesity, overweight,
BMI change or weight change; (iii) assessed shift work ex-
posure with a reliable method; (iv) used observational
study designs, including cross-sectional, cohort or case–
control study design; (v) provided odds ratios (OR) or
risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or provided
sufficient data to calculate them; and (vi) were studies
published in English.
Obesity/overweight in this meta-analysis was defined as
BMI ≥25 kg/m2 or abdominal obesity (multiple criteria in
ethnic populations). Weight change was defined as body
weight having a change of over 5 kg during the period of
follow-up.
The following information was extracted from each
study: (i) name of the first author; (ii) year of publication;
(iii) country of study population; (iv) number of partici-
pants; (v) gender and age of the study participants; (vi)
study design; (vii) definition and category of shift work;
(viii)
definition
of
specific
obesity
types
(i.e.
BMI
≥25 kg/m2, BMI ≥30 kg/m2, abdominal obesity and
weight gain); (ix) OR or risk ratios with 95% CIs and
(x) variables being adjusted in the multiple regression
models.
Study quality assessment
The quality of included studies was assessed according to
the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies
in
Epidemiology
(STROBE)
statement:
guidelines
for
reporting observational studies (31). The STROBE check-
list contains 22 items with 34 sub-items for cohort or
case–control studies and with 32 sub-items for cross-
sectional studies. Using other research that assessed study
quality by STROBE statement as referenced (32), we clas-
sified the quality of primary studies as ‘good (fulfilled
≥80% of total items)’, ‘fair (fulfilled 80–50% of total
items)’ or ‘poor (fulfilled <50% of total items)’ by the
total scores of ≥27, 17–27 and <17 for cohort or case–
control studies or ≥26, 16–26 and <16 for cross-sectional
studies, respectively. There was no significant difference in
the scores for quality assessment of each included study
between the two reviewers.
Statistical analysis
Meta-analysis was performed using STATA 13.0 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX, USA) software. We recalculated ORs
and the 95% CIs for studies of Marqueze et al. (2014)
(33), Marqueze et al. (2012) (22) and Tada et al. (2014)
(34) according to the number of cases and controls by
univariate logistic regression because these three studies
did not provide the corresponding risk estimates. We com-
bined ORs and 95% CIs using a random-effects model if the
I2 index was larger than 50%. Otherwise, the pooled ORs
were calculated by a fixed-effects model. Sensitivity analysis
was performed to examine potential sources of heterogeneity
from several subgroup analyses. Begg’s regression asymmetry
test was used to detect potential publication bias.

 Results
Characteristics of individual studies
A total of 381 articles were retrieved, 362 from the PubMed
database and 19 articles that were searched manually. Of
these, 311 articles were excluded and regarded as irrelevant
after review of the titles and abstracts. Duplicate articles,
meeting abstracts, experimental epidemiological studies,
reviews and in vitro and animal studies were ruled out.
Finally, 70 articles were further reviewed and 28 that were
published between the years of 1999 and 2016 met the
inclusion criteria (Fig. 1).
A summary of the 28 eligible articles is shown in Table 1.
Among these studies, 22 were cross-sectional studies and six
were cohort studies. No case–control study was identified.
Eleven studies (22,27,29,34,38,41,42,44,46,47,51) were
conducted on healthcare workers; all but two studies
(Poulsen et al. (2014) (44) and Gomez-Parra et al. (2015)
(29)) examined outcomes in nurses and midwives. Another
eight studies (23,25,26,36,37,45,48,49) were conducted
among manufacturing employees; one Japan study (35)
focused on the local government organization, and two
Brazil studies (30,33) focused on bus or truck drivers. Six ar-
ticles (24,28,39,40,43,50) reported results with occupation-
ally mixed populations. Eleven studies (26,27,34,38,40–
42,46,47,49,51) focused on female workers, and five
(24,25,30,33,36) focused on male participants. Twelve stud-
ies included participants of both genders. Nine studies
(26,27,34–37,40,46,49) analysed a total of 109,834 East
Asian participants, including the populations from Japan,
Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan. Overall, 15 articles (>50%)
had good quality according to the STROBE statement
guidelines, and the remaining 13 studies were all rated as fair
quality.
Assessment of shift work exposure and
obesity/overweight outcomes with specific criteria
Eleven studies (22,23,25–27,29,33,36,38,41,42) reported
the specific time range in the definition of night shift work,
and all of the studies covered the time range from 24:00 to
05:00 h aligned with the definition of International Labour

 Organization for night shift work (52). Six of the 11 studies
reported a significant risk of obesity/overweight, ranging
from 1.13 (36) to 1.9 (26). The remaining 17 studies did
not provide a specific time definition for night shift work.
Ten studies (24,25,27,29,34–36,41,45,49) found an in-
creased risk of obesity from rotating shift work; three stud-
ies (23,26,48) reported an increased risk from permanent
night work, but only one study (33) reported an increased
risk from irregular shift work. Moreover, Bushnell et al.
(2010) (48) revealed an association between obesity (BMI
≥30 kg/m2) and both rotating shift work and permanent
night work, indicating that night shift work with 10 h per
day had the highest risk of obesity (OR = 1.38, 95%CI:
1.09–1.75). The rest of the included studies did not report
the relationship between different types of shift work and
the risk of obesity/overweight.
Multiple diagnostic criteria were used among the included
studies, and several studies reported associations according
to more than one type of obesity. Overall, there were 14 stud-
ies (22,23,26,30,33–35,37,38,40,43,46,47,49,51) reporting
OR on the risk for BMI ≥25 kg/m2. Another 11 studies (28–
30,39,41,42,44,45,47,48,50) reported OR on the risk for
BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Nine studies (27–30,41,42,44,48,50)
reported OR for abdominal obesity. Two studies (36,38) re-
ported OR for weight/BMI increase. Except for the study of
Pepłońska et al. (2014) (45), all studies that defined BMI
≥30 kg/m2 as obesity showed a significantly excess risk of
obesity between 2% and 194% among shift workers.
Pooled risk estimates between night shift work and
obesity/overweight risk
The pooled OR was 1.23 (95% CI: 1.17–1.29, pheterogeneity-
0.001, I2 = 90.7%) for the association between shift work
and obesity/overweight (Fig. 2). The combined OR of
cross-sectional studies was higher (1.26, 95% CI: 1.19–
1.33, pheterogeneity < 0.001, I2 = 91.7%) than that for cohort
studies (1.10, 95% CI: 0.99–1.21, pheterogeneity = 0.088,
I2 = 47.9%). Results from Begg’s regression asymmetry test
showed no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.371).
Pooled risk estimates in subgroup analyses by
characteristics of studies
To
assess
the
association
between
shift
work
and
obesity/overweight and potential issues of heterogeneity,
subgroup analyses were performed for (i) criteria of
obesity/overweight; (ii) definition and types of shift work;
(iii) gender or type of study population; (iv) measurements
on shift work patterns; and (v) adjustment for confounding
factors (Table 2). The pooled effect was the highest for ex-
amining the association with abdominal obesity (OR = 1.35,
95% CI: 1.13–1.61, pheterogeneity = 0.002, I2 = 67.0%) com-
paring with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and weight/BMI gain, but the
pooled OR for BMI ≥25 kg/m2 showed a similar risk
(OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.15–1.51, pheterogeneity < 0.001,
I2 = 72.9%). The pooled OR for ‘weight/BMI gain’ was
1.13 (95% CI: 1.08–1.19, pheterogeneity = 0.975, I2 = 0.0%).
Studies that specifically defined ‘night work’ as having a
working time between 24:00 and 05:00 h showed a higher
OR (1.32, 95% CI: 1.18–1.48, pheterogeneity < 0.001,
I2 = 74.3%) than those with a broad definition of ‘shift
work’ (1.17, 95%CI: 1.12–1.23, pheterogeneity < 0.001,
I2 = 88.3%) in which day shift workers might be involved.
However, there was marginally significant evidence of a dif-
ferent exposure effect between ‘night work’ and a broad
definition of ‘shift work’, after using ratio of relative risks
(53) to measure interaction (ratio of relative risk 1.127,
95% CI: 0.997–1.274). Although only one study measured
irregular night shift type, three studies revealed that perma-
nent night workers showed higher risk than those rotating
shift workers from 10 studies (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.19–
1.71, pheterogeneity < 0.001, I2 = 70.8% vs. OR = 1.14,
95% CI: 1.05–1.23, pheterogeneity = 0.003, I2 = 67.5%).
For different regions of study population, Asian workers
showed a similar risk of obesity/overweight (OR = 1.29,
95% CI: 1.14–1.46, pheterogeneity < 0.001, I2 = 81.5%) com-
pared with workers from other regions (OR = 1.23, 95%
CI: 1.17–1.29, pheterogeneity < 0.001, I2 = 91.6%). Similar
risk estimates were also demonstrated for different genders
(Table 2). Considering the data collection methods, studies
that assessed shift work exposure according to a factory
schedule showed a higher OR of 1.62 (95% CI: 1.24–
2.11, pheterogeneity < 0.001, I2 = 82.0%) compared with
those that used self-administrated or online-based question-
naires to assess the exposure of shift work. Workers who
were employed mainly in manufacturing industries showed
a higher risk for obesity/overweight (OR = 1.30, 95% CI:
1.16–1.46, pheterogeneity < 0.001, I2 = 78.2%).
Summary of dose–response relationship between
night shift work and obesity/overweight risk
Four of the included studies reported a dose–response rela-
tionship between night shift work exposure and risk of
obesity/overweight (Table 3). Ramin et al. (42) surveyed
over 50,000 American female nurses and found an increas-
ing trend towards obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) risk as the num-
ber of night shifts per month increased, with the highest OR
at 3.42 (95% CI: 1.95–6.03). Among Korean nurses, Kim
et al. (46) reported that shift workers with the longest dura-
tion of shift work (years of shift work, 6.83–38.00 years)
had 1.37 times higher (95% CI: 0.91–2.09) risk of over-
weight (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) than those with the shortest dura-
tion of shift work (years of shift work, 0.08–3.00 years).
Marqueze et al. (2012) estimated that each year of night
shift work might cause an average BMI increase of
0.24 kg/m2 for nurses (22). Pepłońska et al. (41) reported

 a dose–response relationship between shift work exposure
and being obese could be observed from the density (nights
per month), duration (years) and cumulative exposure to
night work, although the relationship did not achieve statis-
tically significance.
Discussion
Our systematic review and meta-analysis are the first to
quantitatively combine the risk estimates of night shift work
on
the
risk
of
specific
and
different
types
of
obesity/overweight from individual studies. We showed that
night shift work increases the risk of obesity/overweight by
23%, and the excess risk with abdominal obesity was even
higher at 35%. There is evidence of an exposure–response
relationship between the intensity of night shift work (i.e.
years of exposure and number of night shifts per month)
and obesity/overweight risk. However, it was not possible
to quantify this because of the limited number of studies
and small variety of intensity descriptions, which highlights
the need for such dose-dependent relationships in the future
research.
Abdominal obesity is characterized by body shape alter-
ation and visceral fat accumulation, which are commonly
associated with abnormal metabolic profiles, such as in-
creased insulin resistance and dyslipidaemias (54). Circa-
dian disruption is a consequence of exposure to light at
night, which may induce the suppression of melatonin. This
is thought to be an important mechanism underlying meta-
bolic abnormalities in night shift workers. Melatonin plays
a key role in synchronizing central and peripheral circadian
rhythms and regulates the secretion of hormones such as
cortisol, insulin (55) and leptin (56). Such misalignments
may lead to a disturbance of body homeostasis and produce

 abnormal metabolic profiles. Circadian disruption has been
considered one of the key potential mechanisms in the
aetiology of obesity occurring with night shift work. Night
shift workers are more prone to abdominal obesity accom-
panied by metabolic disorder, referred to as ‘metabolically
obese’, which might be associated with a higher risk of car-
diovascular disease (57).
Original studies investigating the association between
obesity/overweight and night shift work covering the period
between 24:00 and 05:00 h (52) showed a pooled estimate
OR of 1.32. This reinforces the hazardous consequence of
night working hours. Permanent night shifts showed a higher
risk of obesity/overweight than rotating shifts in this meta-
analysis. The reason for this might be that permanent night
workers are much more frequently exposed to light at night
than rotating shift workers. Moreover, it is difficult to adapt
to new sleep patterns. For example, even after a prolonged
exposure, only a minority of night workers (<3%) showed
a full adaption of their circadian rhythm to nocturnal activity
(58). In addition, as permanent night shift workers have to
sleep during daytime hours, their sleep is more likely to be
interrupted by environmental factors (59), yielding shorter
sleeping times and accumulated chronic sleep debt in shift
workers (60). Conversely, rotating shift workers with contin-
uous adaptation of their circadian systems did not show a
higher risk of obesity/overweight than those working perma-
nent shifts. Sleep deprivation is another remarkable mecha-
nism by which body weight is increased among shift
workers by altering metabolic profile (61,62).
Employees in the manufacturing industry showed a rela-
tively higher risk of obesity/overweight in our study, but
the reason for this remains to be elucidated. Interestingly,
Bushnell et al. (2010) found that shift workers with different
average working hours showed varying degrees of obesity
(BMI ≥30 kg/m2) risk (48). They further pointed out that
the highest risks were among workers on 10-h permanent
night shifts or 12-h rotating shifts compared with other night
shift work schedules (48). The workers who had long work-
ing hours, whether involved in a shift work schedule or not,
exhibited an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus or obe-
sity (63,64). Moreover, the risk for night shift workers
whose work demands a heavy workload, which is common
among manufacturing employees with a 10- or 12-h shift,
could be related to the high energy as they needed extra cal-
ories to maintain their performance during the night-time
shift (65). This is despite no significant difference in the total
daily energy intake between the night shift workers and day-
time workers being observed (65). Night-time eating behav-
iour has been shown to be associated with increased risks of
metabolic disorders, weight gain and breast cancer (66–68).
However, to our knowledge, none of the previous studies in-
vestigated the effect of night eating behaviour on the
aetiology of obesity among night shift workers, which de-
serves further exploration in future studies.
Merits and limitations
This systematic review has merits and some novel findings
that have never been reported previously, and publication
bias was not significant. However, several limitations
should be noted. Firstly, our study found a high degree of
heterogeneity. Attempts were made to identify the origins
of this heterogeneity. Although most studies had adjusted
for several confounding factors, including age and other de-
mographic factors, as well as smoking and drinking habits,
the factors in regression models were varied and considered
inadequate for the studies involving obese outcomes that
constitute a potential source of heterogeneity. Among 28
studies that provided multiple adjusted ORs, only six
(23,35,37,39,46,47) took full consideration of eating habits
and physical activities with lower pooled OR, indicating

 that lifestyle factors need to be fully considered in future
studies to produce more accurate risk estimates for night
shift work.
Secondly, the lack of a consistent definition of night shift
work is a concern in our meta-analysis, which may lead to a
dilution of effects. Because more than half of the studies
used vague definitions of shift work, a degree of misclassifi-
cation of night shift work exposure might have occurred.
Moreover, multiple diagnosis criteria of obesity/overweight
(e.g. BMI and abdominal obesity) were adopted in the orig-
inal studies, which contribute to the high heterogeneity of
our pooled estimate. This heterogeneity remained in some
subgroups analyses using similar diagnosis criteria of
obesity/overweight, indicating other potential sources of
heterogeneity, such as study design. BMI or waist circumfer-
ence could not fully represent the metabolic abnormalities
and the increase of adipose tissue in the human body (69).
Accordingly, greater consideration of metabolic disturbance
in individuals with obesity is needed in future studies of
night shift workers.
The overall pooled association between night shift work
and weight gain may be underestimated in the cross-
sectional study design as a result of a potential healthy
worker survival effect that makes the remained employees
healthier than those who quit shift work (70). However,
our study actually found a higher risk on subgroup analysis
of cross-sectional studies than that of cohort studies. A
precise description of the definition of night shift work, es-
pecially the exposure assessment on the time range of night
shift should be provided. Because cross-sectional studies
cannot determine cause and effect, large-scale prospective
cohort studies with a long period of follow-up and better
assessment of both exposure and obesity/overweight out-
comes, such as measurement of body adipose tissue, are
needed in future studies.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis demonstrated that night shift work was
associated with an increased risk of obesity/overweight,
particularly abdominal obesity, and the risk was more
prominent among long-term night shift workers. A positive
gradient
was
suggested
for
the
relation
between
obesity/overweight and the increasing exposure frequency
and intensity of night shift work. Modification of working
schedules to avoid prolonged exposure to long-term night
shift work might be an efficient administrative control to
reduce the risk of obesity. Large-scale prospective cohort
studies with more accurate measurements of night shift
work and obesity are needed for future research.
