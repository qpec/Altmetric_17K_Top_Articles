Objective: Depression symptom severity, the most com-
monly studied outcome in antidepressant treatment trials,
accounts for only a small portion of burden related to major
depression. While lost work productivity is the biggest con-
tributor to depression’s economic burden, few studies have
systematically evaluated the independent effect of treatment
onworkproductivityandtherelationshipbetweenchangesin
work productivity and longer-term clinical course.
Method: Work productivity was measured repeatedly by
the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment self-report
questionnaire in 331 employed participants with major de-
pression enrolled in the Combining Medications to Enhance
Depression Outcomes trial. Trajectories of change in work
productivity during the first 6 weeks of treatment were
identified and used to predict remission at 3 and 7 months.
Results: Participants reported reduced absence from work
and increased work productivity with antidepressant treatment
even after controlling for changes in depression severity.
Three distinct trajectories of changes in work productivity
wereidentified:1)robustearlyimprovement(24%),2)minimal
change (49%), and 3) high-impairment slight reduction (27%).
Compared with other participants, those with robust im-
provement had 3–5 times higher remission rates at 3 months
and 2–5 times higher remission rates at 7 months, even after
controlling for select baseline variables and remission status
at week 6.
Conclusions: In this secondary analysis, self-reported work
productivity improved in depressed patients with antide-
pressant treatment even after accounting for depressive
symptom reduction. Early improvement in work productivity
is associated with much higher remission rates after 3 and
7 months of treatment.

Major depressive disorder, the second leading cause of dis-
ability globally (1, 2), accounts for one-tenth of all years lived
with disability (3). Reduced work productivity accounts for
over 80% of the financial costs attributed to depression (4), as
depressed patients have substantial work productivity im-
pairments(5, 6).Presenteeism(reduced productivitywhile at
work) and absenteeism (absence from work) have been as-
sociated with the loss of 18.2–46.8 and 7.8–8.7 workdays per
worker per year, respectively (7, 8). Among baseline clinical
and sociodeomographic variables, depressive symptom se-
verity was the strongest predictor of work productivity im-
pairment after a year (9) in a community-based cohort (10).
However, several other factors have been shown to be asso-
ciatedwithpoorworkproductivity(e.g.,part-timeemployment
status [6], fair or poor general health [6], history of suicide at-
tempt [5], anxious features, and earlier age at onset of
depression [5]). Impaired cognitive function has also been linked
to disrupted work productivity in depressed patients (11, 12).
With effective antidepressant treatments, work productivity
improves (5, 13–15), and this improvement is predicted by
baseline levels of depression symptoms and work productivity
(13) along with other clinical (e.g., recurrent episodes, mel-
ancholicoratypicalfeatures)anddemographic(e.g.,education
level) factors (5). Outside of reduction in depression symptom
severity, changes in cognitive function may be an important
factor in improvement of work productivity. Recent data from
the International Mood Disorders Collaborative Project sug-
gest that cognitive function explains variability in workplace
function to a greater extent than depression symptom severity
(16). Importantly, both cognitive and workplace impairments
are often still noted even with achievement of remission of
depression symptoms (17).

ARTICLES
 The long-term deleterious effects of greater depression
severity on work (9,18–20) are well known. As a baselinefactor,
being employed (5, 6, 21, 22) has been shown to predict better
clinical outcomes. However, whether changes in work pro-
ductivityaffectthetypicallychronicorrecurrentcourse(23–25)
of depression is unknown. Our knowledge of the relationship
between depressive symptoms and work productivity is also
limited by the fact that most studies of work productivity im-
provement during antidepressant treatment have measured
changes only between baseline and posttreatment (5, 13–15).
Multipleassessmentsoverthecourseoftreatmentasusedinthe
present study would clarify better how depressive symptoms
relate to work productivity improvement.
The present study, a secondary analysis, tested the hy-
pothesis that early improvement in work productivity would
beassociatedwithbetterlong-termoutcomes.Usingdatafrom
the Combining Medications to Enhance Depression Out-
comes (CO-MED) trial (26), a multisite single-blind ran-
domized controlled trial of outpatients with chronic and/or
recurrent nonpsychotic depression, we repeatedly measured
and evaluated changes in work productivity associated with
antidepressant treatment. The CO-MED trial included both an
acute phase of 12 weeks (3 months) and a continuation phase
of an additional 16 weeks (total 7 months) for patients with
a clinical response, thereby allowing for evaluation of the re-
lationship between work productivity and antidepressant
response over the course of 7 months of treatment (26). We
addressed this issue by identifying subgroups of trial partici-
pants based on work productivity changes during the first
6 weeks of acute-phase treatment and estimated the association
of these groups with depressive symptom status/improvement
during the remaining 6 weeks of acute-phase treatment and
the ensuing 16 weeks of continuation-phase treatment.
METHOD
Study Overview and Participants
The CO-MED trial was approved by the institutional review
boards at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center at Dallas, the University of Pittsburgh Data Co-
ordinating Center, and each participating regional center and
clinical site, and it was monitored by an independent data
safetyand monitoring board. All participants provided written
informed consent prior to completing study procedures.
Details of the study design, measurements, and primary
outcomes are available elsewhere (26). From six primary and
nine psychiatric care sites, CO-MED enrolled 665 participants
withnonpsychotic chronic(current episode exceeded 2 years)
or recurrent depression with a current episode $2 months
and a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17)
score $16.
Participants, stratified by clinical sites, were assigned in a
1:1:1 ratio to 1) escitalopram plus placebo (selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] monotherapy), 2) sustained-release
bupropion plus escitalopram (bupropion combination), or 3)
extended-release venlafaxine plus mirtazapine (venlafaxine
combination).Measurement-basedcare(27)wasimplemented
bystudy physiciansat each visittotailor antidepressantdosage
adjustments for each individual participant based on scores
on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-
Clinician-Rated version (QIDS-C) (28) and the Frequency,
Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating scale (29).
Assessments
The measures below were obtained at baseline and each
subsequentstudyvisitoftheacutephase(weeks1,2,4,6,8,10,
and 12) and the continuation phase (weeks 16, 20, 24, and 28).
QIDS-C and QIDS-Self-Report (QIDS-SR). The total score for
the QIDS-C and QIDS-SR (range of 0–27) is based on the nine
criteria symptom domains out of the 16 items, each of which
is scored from 0 to 3 (28). In a previous report, the Pearson
product-moment correlation coefficient between QIDS-SR
andHAM-D-17was0.86,andbetweenQIDS-CandHAM-D-17
it was 0.93 (30). The Cronbach’s a of QIDS-SR and QIDS-C
have ranged from 0.86 to 0.87 in previous reports (28, 30, 31).
The QIDS-SR served as the primary measure of depressive
symptoms. The QIDS-C was completed by the clinician to
monitor symptom changes and guide treatment decisions.
Work Productivity and Impairment Questionnaire. The Work
Productivity and Impairment questionnaire, a six-item self-
report scale, has good construct validity and test-retest re-
liability(32).Itemsincludeemploymentstatus(item1);number
of hours missed from work in the last week due to health
reasons (range: 0–80; item 2); number of hours missed from
work due to other reasons such as vacation (item 3); number of
hoursworkedinthelastweek(range:0–80;item4);impairment
resulting from health conditions while working using a scale of
0–10,where0indicatesnoimpairment(item5);andimpairment
in regular daily activities other than work or job (item 6).
Using the scoring guide by Reilly (33), absenteeism
(percent of time missed from work), presenteeism (percent
of impairment while working), and work productivity loss
(percent of overall work impairment) were calculated using
formulas based on items 2, 4, and 5. These scores are ex-
pressed as percentages, with higher scores reflecting greater
impairment, and they comprised the primary work outcome
measures for the present study.
In addition to these scores, the number of hours lost to
impaired productivity while at work was calculated using
the following formula: (item 4)*(item 5/10). And this was
reported along with item 2 in the following categories: none
(0 hours), .0–4 hours (half a day of work), .4–8 hours
(whole day of work), .8–20 hours (half a week of work),
and .20 hours (greater than half a week of work).
The Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical
Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ). The total score of this
seven-item self-report questionnaire is calculated by adding
the following items: motivation/interest, wakefulness/
alertness, energy, ability to focus, ability to remember, ability

 to find words, and sharpness/mental acuity. The Pearson
product-moment correlation coefficient between the CPFQ
and HAM-D-17 ranged from 0.24 to 0.29 in a previous report
(34). The Cronbach’s a of the CPFQ has ranged from 0.89 to
0.91 in previous reports (34, 35).
Clinical improvement. Symptomatic remission at 12 weeks,
the primary outcome of CO-MED, was ascribed if out of the
last two consecutive QIDS-SR scores at least one was less
than 6, while the other was less than 8. As described by
Rush et al. (26), this definition of remission in the CO-MED
trial was chosen a priori “to ensure that a single ‘good week’
was not falsely signaling remission” in lieu of the con-
ventional criteria of remission (QIDS-SR score #5) for
1 week (36). Remission was measured at week 28 in a
similar fashion.
Participation beyond 12 weeks (continuation phase) was
contingent on whether participants received an acceptable
benefit (defined as a QIDS-C score of 9 or less by week 12) or
had reached a score of 10–13 on the QIDS-C and both the
study physician and the participant decided to continue
treatment because of substantial benefit.
Statistical Analyses
The analytic sample for this study included all CO-MED
participants who were employed when they enrolled in the
study (331 out of 665 [49.8%]). Based on the literature, we
included the following baseline clinical and sociodemo-
graphic features to evaluate their role as predictors of change
in work productivity outcomes: age, education (less than
12 years, 12–15 years, and $16 years of schooling), monthly
income (,$2,000, $2,000–$4,000, and greater than $4,000),
gender, race (white, black, other), Hispanic ethnicity, pres-
ence of anxious features at baseline, onset of depressive
symptoms before age 18, presence of suicidal ideations at
baseline, and baseline levels of depressive symptom severity,
cognitive functioning, and each work productivity outcome
(5, 13–15).
Because participation in the continuation phase of
CO-MED was based on clinical improvement (26), statistical
analyses were conducted separately for the acute and con-
tinuation phases. It is noteworthy that because the treatment
arms were not significantly different with respect to de-
pression outcomes in the primary report (26), we did not
hypothesize a differential effect of treatment arm on work

WORK PRODUCTIVITY AND CLINICAL COURSE IN DEPRESSED OUTPATIENTS
 productivity outcomes; how-
ever,wedidincludetreatment
arm in the analysis to evaluate
whether such an effect was
present.
We estimated the change
over time in each work pro-
ductivity outcome (absen-
teeism, presenteeism, and
work productivity loss) using
repeated-measures
analysis
of variance with visit as the
within-subject factor and all
other variables as between-
subject factors. We used
linear mixed-model analyses
with QIDS-SR and CPFQ
scores at each visit, along
with baseline covariates and
baseline levels of each work
productivity
outcome
and
baseline CPFQ and QIDS-SR
scores. For the continuation
phase, we included scores on
the QIDS-SR and CPFQ and
each work productivity out-
come at week 12 as additional
covariates in the analyses. We estimated the correlation
coefficients between work productivity outcome measures
and depression severity, as wellas the nine symptom domains
included in the QIDS-SR. Because the variability of obser-
vations between participants is usually higher com-
pared with the repeated observations in a single participant
(37), we calculated the correlation coefficients based on
repeated observations over time using PROC MIXED as
implemented in SAS (38).
To develop groupings based on changes in work pro-
ductivity during the first 6 weeks of acute-phase treatment,
we used PROC TRAJ as implemented in SAS to estimate
discrete mixture models with censored normal distri-
bution (39). For both linear and nonlinear (two-, three-,
and four-degree polynomials) models, we increased the
number of groupings in a stepwise fashion while evaluating
changes in the model fit using Bayesian information criteria
and Akaike information criteria with the lowest value in-
dicating the best model fit (40). We selected the final model
based on fit and parsimony, group size, and interpretability.
The groups were then compared with chi-square or gen-
eral linear model for baseline clinical and sociodemographic
features. Association of these groups with changes in de-
pression severity after week 6 of CO-MED and remission at
3monthsand 7 months were estimated usingmixed models
and logistic regression (first univariate and then multivari-
ate analyses with backward elimination), respectively, after
controlling for the above-mentioned baseline clinical and
sociodemographic variables.
We used Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
when indicated, set the level of significance at 0.05, and have
reported all p values after adjustment for multiple compar-
isons. All analyses were done using SAS 9.3 (SAS, Inc.,
Cary, N.C.).
RESULTS
Ofthe665CO-MED participants, 331(49.8%)wereemployed
at baseline and did not differ on baseline sociodemographic
or clinical variables among the three treatment arms (Table 1).
During both the acute and continuation phases, work pro-
ductivity loss and presenteeism were very highly correlated
(0.94–0.95), while the correlation coefficients of absen-
teeism and presenteeism ranged from 0.37 to 0.47. Using
conventional criteria proposed by Cohen (41), there was a
medium (.0.3) correlation between presenteeism and work
productivity loss with the following depressive symptom
domains: sad mood, concentration, general interest, energy
level, and psychomotor agitation/retardation (also see
Table 2).

 work fell from 23.1% at baseline to 6.8% at week 12 (Figure 1).
All work productivity outcomes significantly improved after
12weeksoftreatment.Themeanrateofabsenteeism(percent
of time missed from work) reduced significantly (F=6.34,
df=7, 1606, p,0.0001), from 12.34 hours (SD=22.8) at base-
line to 4.17 hours (SD=13.9) at 12 weeks; the mean rate of

creased significantly (F=22.82, df=7, 1707, p,0.0001), from
40.4 hours (SD=31.5) at baseline to 19.8 hours (SD=22.5)
at 12 weeks; and the mean rate of work productivity loss (over-
all work impairment that includes absenteeism and/or
presenteeism) lowered significantly (F=22.85, df=7, 1632,
p,0.0001), from 44.9 hours (SD=32.4) at baseline to 21.0

(F=5.79, df=6, 1213, p,0.0001) continued to be significant
even after controlling for QIDS-SR and CPFQ scores at
each visit, baseline clinical and sociodemographic variables
along with baseline QIDS-SR and CPFQ scores and base-
line absenteeism, presenteeism, and work productivity loss,
respectively.
Continuation phase. Changes
duringthecontinuationphase
were not statistically signifi-
cant after controlling for
changes in QIDS-SR scores,
CPFQ scores, baseline clinical
and sociodemographic vari-
ables along with baseline
and 12-week scores on the
QIDS-SR and CPFQ and base-
line and 12-week levels of each

(absenteeism[F=2.13,df=3,427,

df=3, 452, p=0.27], or work
productivity loss [F=0.93,
df=3, 413, p=0.43]).
During the acute phase,an
educational level of college
or higher was associated
with lower absenteeism, pre-
senteeism, and work pro-
ductivity loss. Other baseline
variables, excluding baseline
levels of each work pro-
ductivity outcome, did not
significantly predict change
in work productivity out-
comesduringeithertheacute
or continuation phase (for
detailed results, see Table S1
in the data supplement ac-
companying the online ver-
sion of this article). Changes
in CPFQ scores were significantly associated with work
productivity changes during both the acute and continuation
phases (see Table S1 in the online data supplement). Addi-
tionally, during both the acute and continuation phases,
the bupropion and venlafaxine combinations did not differ
from SSRI monotherapy for any of the work productivity
outcomes.
Groups Based on Change in Work Productivity Within
the First 6 Weeks of Treatment
The final model (Figure 2) identified the following three
trajectories of change in work productivity during the first
6 weeks of the acute phase: 1) robust early improvement
(23.8% of participants), 2) minimal change (49.2% of par-
ticipants), and 3) high-impairment slight reduction (27.0%
of participants). The model fit estimates for linear and
nonlinear models with step-wise increase in the number of
groupings, and maximum likelihood estimates of the final
model parameters are presented in Tables S2 and S3, re-
spectively, in the online data supplement. At baseline, the
three groups did not differ with regard to clinical and socio-
demographic variables, except depression severity; the

QIDS-SR scores than participants in the robust early im-
pairment and minimal change groups (see Table S4 in the
data supplement).
Association of Groups Defined by Early and Robust
Change in Work Productivity With Subsequent Clinical
Improvement
Participants with robust early improvement in work pro-
ductivity had significantly higher unadjusted remission
rates at 3 and 7 months compared with those with minimal
change (3 months odds ratio=3.1, 95% confidence interval
[CI]=1.5–6.6; 7 months odds ratio=2.9, 95% CI=1.2–6.8) and
high-impairment slight reduction (3 months odds ratio=7.7,
95% CI=3.2–18.5; 7 months odds ratio=7.1, 95% CI=2.7–19.2).
After controlling for remission status at week 6 and baseline
clinical and sociodemographic variables, participants with
robust early improvement continued to have significantly
higher remission rates at both 3 months (odds ratio=5.4, 95%
CI=1.8–15.9) and 7 months (odds ratio=5.0, 95% CI=1.5–16.4)
when compared with those with high-impairment slight
reduction. However, when compared with those with min-

DISCUSSION
We found that work productivity improved with acute-
phase antidepressant treatment even after accounting for
change in depression severity and self-reported cognitive
functioning. Secondly, the trajectories of this improvement in
work productivity predicted long-term changes in de-
pression severity and remission status. During the first

JHA ET AL.
 6 weeks of the trial, two groups of depressed participants
(those with robust early improvement and those with
minimal change) started at similar levels of work pro-
ductivity and depression severity. One group attained an
early and sustained reduction in work productivity loss,
while the other experienced minimal change. The group
with early improvement in work productivity had markedly
lower levels of depression severity throughout the duration
of the trial (28 weeks) and continued to be in remission at
much higher rates at week 12, even after controlling for
baseline clinical and sociodemographic variables and re-
mission status at week 6. Early improvement in work pro-
ductivity appears to be an important mediator of sustained
remission.
These findings are consistent with prior reports that work
productivity improves with antidepressant treatment (5,
13–15). In addition, the role of baseline levels of work pro-
ductivity in predicting subsequent change with time (see
Table S5 in the online data supplement) is consistent with
the findings of Beck et al. (13). In line with the findings of
Trivedi et al. (5), we also found that baseline educational
level moderated work productivity improvement with anti-
depressant treatment.
The high positive correlation between work productivity
loss and presenteeism implies that a large portion of vari-
ance in overall work productivity loss is accounted for by
presenteeism—that is, while employees are at their job, their
productivity is substantially impaired. This result is consis-
tent with epidemiological findings that presenteeism, com-
paredwithabsenteeism,accountsforthemajorityofthework
productivity impairment (7, 8). Furthermore, our results that
work productivity outcomes were similar for SSRI mono-
therapy and the bupropion and venlafaxine combinations are
consistent with what was found with respect to depression
symptom severity in the CO-MED trial.
Our findings that significant improvement in work pro-
ductivity occurred even after accounting for baseline de-
mographic and clinical factors, as well as changes in
depression severity and self-reported cognitive functioning,
support the importance of measuring work productivity
during antidepressant treatment. Measures of depression
severity fail to adequately capture the burden of depression
(42). Additionally, we found that changes in cognitive func-
tioning were significantly associated with changes in work
productivity. This report adds to the growing evidence re-
garding the importance of improving cognitive functioning
in depressed patients. Our findings further support attain-
ment of functional recovery as the ultimate outcome of an-
tidepressant treatment (43, 44).
The results of this study may have practical implication
if our findings are replicated. Work productivity may be
an easy-to-administer patient-centered outcome that can
identify patients early in the course of treatment who may
benefit with treatment change or augmentation. Among de-
pressive symptom domains, energy and concentration are
most strongly associated with work productivity outcomes.
Hence, targeting these symptom domains with adjunct treat-
ments may boost work productivity and improve long-term
outcomes. Adjunctive occupational therapy has been shown to
improve depression severity in the long-term (45). Similarly,
telephone-based coaching interventions focused on improving
work productivity have been reported to improve depressive
symptomseverityinpatientswithdysthymia(46).Perhapssuch
interventions could play a pivotal role in increasing the likeli-
hood of sustained remission in patients with residual work
impairment.
There are several limitations to our report. It is a sec-
ondary analysis. This study did not include any intervention
that was meant to independently improve work productivity.
Additionally, the work productivity measure in our study was
subjective and based on self-report. Hence, it likely differs
from objective measures of work productivity, such as those
collected by employers. Furthermore, the generalizability of
our findings to routine clinical care may be restricted by
the high quality of treatment received by participants in
the CO-MED trial. While adopted by the major treatment
guidelines for decades, measurement-based care has not be-
come routine practice.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that work pro-
ductivity outcomes improve significantly with antidepres-
sant treatment and reflect burden of disease that is not
captured adequately by depression severity alone. We have
also demonstrated that early changes in work productivity
are significant predictors of long-term clinical course. These
findings highlight the multidimensional improvement with
antidepressant treatment and argue for inclusion of work
productivity assessments in routine clinical practice.
