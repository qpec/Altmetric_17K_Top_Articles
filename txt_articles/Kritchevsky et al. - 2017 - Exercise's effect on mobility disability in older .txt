Objective: Some data suggest that obesity blunts the benefits of exercise on mobility in older adults. This
study tested the homogeneity of the effect of a physical activity intervention on major mobility disability
(MMD) across baseline obesity classifications in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders
(LIFE) Study. LIFE randomized 1,635 sedentary men and women aged 70 to 89 years to a moderate-
intensity physical activity (PA) or health education program.
Methods: MMD, defined as the inability to walk 400 m, was determined over an average follow-up of 2.6
years. Participants were divided into four subgroups: (1) nonobese (BMI < 30 kg/m2; n 5 437); (2) nonobese
with high waist circumference (WC > 102 cm [men], > 88 cm [women]; n 5 434); (3) class 1 obesity (30 kg/
m2 � BMI < 35 kg/m2; n 5 430); and (4) class 2 1 obesity (BMI � 35 kg/m2; n 5 312). Cox proportional hazard
modeling was used to test an obesity by intervention interaction.
Results: The PA intervention had the largest benefit in participants with class 2 1 obesity (hazard ratio
0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.48, 0.98). However, there was no statistically significant difference in
benefit across obesity categories.
Conclusions: A structured PA program reduced the risk of MMD even in older adults with extreme obesity.

Introduction
In the United States, obesity affects nearly 13 million adults aged 65
and over (1). Both overall obesity and abdominal obesity are
strongly associated with the development of mobility limitations and
major mobility disability (MMD) in older adults (2-5). MMD can be
defined as the inability to walk 400 m without sitting and without
help from another person or walker (6). The inability to walk 400 m

CLINICAL TRIALS AND INVESTIGATIONS
Obesity
 can represent a proxy for common daily activities such as the inabil-
ity to walk a block around the neighborhood or to walk several
street blocks to enter a store. MMD can have implications for qual-
ity of life and independence; however, few studies have examined
the ability to reduce MMD in an older adult population with obesity.
The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE)
Study is the first study to demonstrate that a moderate-intensity
physical activity program can significantly reduce the risk for onset
of MMD in high-risk sedentary older adults (6), but we do not know
how baseline obesity status is related to the intervention outcome.
Previous data on older populations from both epidemiologic studies
and clinical trials suggest that obesity may attenuate the beneficial
effects of physical activity on mobility. For example, in the Health,
Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study, physically
active older adults with obesity had a significantly higher risk of
mobility limitations compared to inactive nonobese persons (7). In
the LIFE Pilot Study, participants with obesity in the physical activ-
ity arm showed no improvement in 400-m walk time and blunted
improvement in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) com-
pared to nonobese participants (8), while nonobese participants
improved in 400-m walk time and SPPB score.
Together, these findings suggest that obesity may blunt the benefits
of physical activity for the prevention of mobility disability. In order
to examine this issue in more detail, we performed a post hoc analy-
sis of the main LIFE Study data, a randomized trial of physical
activity including 1,635 adults aged 70 to 89 years at high risk for
mobility disability. The objective of this study was to test whether
the degree of obesity at baseline influences the strength of the asso-
ciation between randomization to an exercise intervention and inci-
dence of MMD. Based on previous data, we hypothesized that par-
ticipants with obesity would have a blunted response to exercise
compared to participants without obesity. To further extend previous
work, we examined the intervention effects by severity of obesity in
the following four classifications with/without abdominal obesity:
(1) nonobese and low waist circumference, (2) nonobese with high
waist circumference, (3) class 1 obesity, and (4) class 2 1 obesity.
Methods
Study design
The LIFE Study’s design, recruitment, and primary results have
been published (2,6,9). Briefly, the LIFE Study was a single-blind,
multicenter, parallel randomized controlled trial of a physical activ-
ity (PA) intervention compared with a health education (HE) control
arm. The study was conducted at eight U.S. centers, testing whether
randomization to a moderate-intensity PA program would reduce the
rate of MMD compared to the HE program. The study enrolled inac-
tive men and women reporting less than 20 min/wk of structured
physical activity and less than 125 min/wk of moderate-intensity
physical activity who were 70 to 89 years old and at high risk for
mobility disability based on scoring 9 or less on the 12-point SPPB
(10). Eligible participants were able to walk 400 m without assis-
tance in less than 15 minutes, had no major cognitive impairment,
and
could
safely
participate
in
the
intervention.
Recruitment
occurred from February 2010 through December 2011; the trial
ended in December 2013. The median follow-up time was 2.7 years
(interquartile range, 2.3-3.1 years). Participants were followed for up
to 3.5 years. The LIFE Study was approved by the institutional
review board at all eight study sites, and all participants provided
informed consent (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT0107 2500).
The CONSORT diagram and study centers and personnel are pro-
vided (Supporting Information Figure S1 and Supporting Informa-
tion Appendix S1).
Intervention
Participants were randomly assigned to either a PA (n 5 818) or HE
(n 5 817) program. The PA program focused on walking, strength,
balance, and flexibility training. In a single session, the goal was 30
minutes of walking at a moderate intensity, 10 minutes of lower-
extremity strength training using ankle weights, and 10 minutes of
balance training of major muscle groups. Participants were expected
to attend two in-person, center-based training sessions per week and
perform at-home activities three to four times a week for the entire
study period. Supplementary instructional materials (e.g., videotapes,
printed materials) were supplied to participants to reinforce the
physical activity training occurring during setting-based instruction
so that it could be conducted in the home environment. Participants
were also instructed to maintain a simple daily activity calendar/log
at home to record the details (i.e., intensity [rating of perceived
exertion], duration, and frequency) of physical activity, which were
reported to the clinic staff during intervention visits.
The HE arm involved in-person group workshops focused on aging-
relevant topics such as nutrition, safety, and legal/financial issues.
Sessions were composed of 60 to 90 minutes of interactive and
didactic presentations, including approximately 10 minutes of group
discussion and interaction and 5 to 10 minutes of upper extremity
stretching exercises. The HE sessions were held in person once a
week for the first 26 weeks, then monthly thereafter. Attendance
was calculated as the percentage of scheduled visits attended. Visits
that could not be scheduled for medical reasons are not included in
the denominator.
Measures
General health status, medical history, functional limitations, and
demographics were collected by self-report at baseline. Participants
were measured and weighed in light clothing and without shoes.
Height was measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer, and body
weight was measured using a calibrated balance-beam scale. BMI
was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by height squared (m).
Waist circumference (WC) was measured at the abdomen horizon-
tally at midpoint between highest point of the iliac crest and low-
est part of the costal margin in the mid-axillary line using a Gulick
II Tape Measure (model 67020). BMI and WC were used to clas-
sify participants into the following categories: (1) nonobese and
free
of
abdominal
obesity
(BMI < 30
kg/m2;
n 5 437);
(2)
nonobese with abdominal obesity (WC > 102 cm [men], > 88 cm
[women]; n 5 434); (3) class 1 obesity (30 kg/m2 � BMI < 35 kg/
m2; n 5 430); and (4) class 2 to 3 obesity (BMI � 35 kg/m2;
n 5 312). Participants who were missing baseline WC data were
excluded (n 5 22). Virtually all (98%) participants with obesity
had abdominal obesity.
Metabolic syndrome was defined based on the criteria recom-
mended in the 2009 Joint Interim Statement from multiple scien-
tific
associations

 components, including (1) abdominal obesity (defined above); (2)
hypertension (systolic blood pressure � 130 mm Hg and/or dia-
stolic blood pressure � 85 mm Hg) or use of antihypertensive med-
ication and a history of physician-diagnosed hypertension; (3) low
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level (men: < 40 mg/
dL and women: < 50 mg/dL) or use of HDL-C-raising medication;
(4) elevated triglyceride level (�150 mg/dL) or use of triglyceride-
lowering medication; and (5) elevated plasma fasting blood glu-
cose level (�100 mg/dL) or use of glucose-controlling medication.
The SPPB comprises three lower extremity tasks: a 4-m usual-paced
walk done twice, timed rising from a chair five times as fast as pos-
sible without using arms, and the ability to maintain standing bal-
ance for at least 10 seconds with progressively more challenging
stances (side by side, semitandem, and full tandem) (10). The faster
of the two walks and times on the other tests are used to calculate a
score, with participants garnering up to 4 points for each task. SPPB
was collected at baseline and at 6 months, 12 months, 24 months,
and 36 months after randomization.
Self-reported physical activity was assessed using the Community
Health
Activities
Model
Program
for
Seniors
Questionnaire
(CHAMPS-18 items) to assess participation in walking or strength
training activities (12). The CHAMPS questionnaire was collected at
baseline and at 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months after
randomization.
Outcome
The primary outcome of MMD was defined as the inability to
complete a 400-m walk test within 15 minutes without sitting and
without the help of another person or walker. At the assessments, par-
ticipants were asked to walk 400 m at their usual pace, without over-
exerting, completing 10 laps of a 20-m walking course (40 m per lap).
Participants were allowed to stop for up to 1 minute for fatigue or
related symptoms. The use of a cane was allowed. A panel, blinded to
the intervention assignment, adjudicated participants who were in sit-
uations in which the 400-m walk could not be performed (e.g., the par-
ticipant was hospitalized or seen at home, where a suitable walk
course was not available); 14% of events were based on adjudication.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were summarized by intervention arm and
obesity status, using mean and standard deviation (SD) or number
and percentage. Self-reported minutes per week of moderate-
intensity walking exercises were tallied at 6 and 24 months post ran-
domization. SPPB measures and 400-m walk speed were analyzed
using mixed-effects analysis of covariance models for repeated
measures outcomes with an unstructured parameterization for longi-
tudinal covariance. Models included field center and sex (used to
stratify randomization), baseline value for SPPB (400-m gait speed),
intervention, clinic visit, and an intervention by visit interaction.
Least squares means were obtained from these models, and contrast
statements were used to estimate the average effects over the entire
follow-up period.
Cox regression models, stratified by field center and sex, were used
to evaluate the effect of obesity on MMD. Failure time was meas-
ured from the time of randomization to the first incidence of MMD;
follow-up was censored at the last successfully completed 400-m
walk test. For participants who did not have any MMD assessments,
we assigned 1 hour of follow-up time, because we know that they
completed the 400-m walk at baseline. An interaction term was
entered into the primary Cox model, and likelihood ratio tests were
used to assess the consistency of the intervention effect across levels
of baseline obesity.
No adjustments were made for multiple testing. Nominal P values
are reported throughout as simple guides to possible associations.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Results
Of the 1,635 randomized participants, 22 were excluded from this
analysis due to missing baseline WC, yielding an analysis sample of
1,613 participants, with 809 randomized to the PA arm and 804 in the
HE arm. Participant characteristics by obesity category and interven-
tion arm at baseline are presented in Table 1. Nonobese participants
were older, more likely to be white and male, more highly educated,
and less likely to have metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or arthritis.
Nonobese participants also completed the 400-m walk more quickly
than participants with obesity. There were no significant differences in
baseline characteristics among participants in the HE or PA interven-
tion arms across obesity categories, except that the HE intervention
arm was slightly older than the PA arm.
At 24 months, attendance at the scheduled center-based intervention
sessions was 63% for the PA program and 73% for the HE program.
Table 2 presents session attendance by obesity category. Session
attendance was similar for each obesity group within each treatment
arm.
As reported previously, randomization to the PA group was associ-
ated with an 18% reduction in the rate of MMD (hazard ratio: 0.82,
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69, 0.98, P 5 0.04). Figure 1 shows
the overall intervention effect on risk of mobility disability, the
effect within each obesity category, and the effect for those with
BMI < 30 and those with BMI � 30. The point estimates for the
intervention effect on reducing mobility disability were below 1 in
each obesity category, and the strongest effect was observed in those
with class 2 1 obesity (hazard ratio: 0.69, 95% CI 0.48, 0.98). A for-
mal test of statistical interaction between obesity category and treat-
ment arm did not reach statistical significance (P 5 0.49). After
adjustment for the comorbid conditions heart failure, heart attack,
lung disease, and diabetes, the results were nearly unchanged.
Additionally, we looked at the intervention effect on two measures
of mobility performance: 4-m walk speed and SPPB score, which
were both measured at the 6-, 12-, and 24-month postrandomization
visits. There was no overall intervention effect on 4-m walk speed
over the first 24 months of the study (P 5 0.73), nor was there evi-
dence of an interaction between intervention arm and obesity status
(P 5 0.36; data not shown). There was an overall beneficial PA
effect on SPPB score (Table 3; mean change score 5 0.23, 95% CI
0.07, 0.39, P 5 0.013). The obesity strata that showed the largest PA
effect on SPPB score was the group with BMI < 30 and abdominal
obesity, but there was no statistical interaction between intervention
arm and obesity category (P 5 0.23).

 To explore why the largest intervention effect for MMD may have
been observed in those participants with class 2 1 obesity, we exam-
ined the intervention effect on exercise behaviors compared to base-
line. Figure 2 shows the median of self-reported minutes per week
of moderate-intensity walking at baseline and at 6 months, defined
as walking exercises such as minutes of walking/golf, jogging, walk-
ing uphill, walking fast, or leisure walking. The baseline minutes are
pooled. The median walking time among nonobese individuals in
the HE arm was 105 minutes at baseline with no change at 6-month
follow-up, while the PA arm reported 225 minutes. Persons with
class 1 obesity in the HE arm spontaneously increased their walking
by 75 minutes at 6 months, while the PA participants reported 210
min/wk of walking, as expected. Class 2 1 obesity participants in
the HE arm did not report any increase in their walking at 6 months
(30 min/wk), while the PA group increased their walking to 135 min/
wk. Although the class 2 1 obesity PA participants had fewer
minutes of walking at 6 months than the PA participants in other
obesity categories, the class 2 1 obesity subjects reported nearly
five times as many minutes walking as HE subjects in their obesity
category. In other obesity categories, PA participants at 6 months
reported only
about twice as many minutes walking as HE
participants.

 Discussion
Based on prior data, we hypothesized that older adults with obesity
would not achieve as large a benefit as nonobese older adults. This
hypothesis was not supported, as participants with class 2 1 obesity
showed the largest intervention benefit (31% reduction in risk of
MMD). However, we did not find statistical evidence for an interac-
tion between obesity category and intervention arm, and those with
class 2 1 obesity did not show parallel benefits with respect to either
SPPB performance or 4-m gait speed.
One prior observational study and two smaller randomized trials
suggested obesity might blunt the effects of exercise on mobility
disability (5,7,8). The Health ABC study suggested that obesity
“trumped” the effect of other behavioral risk factors on the onset of
mobility limitation (7). Health ABC differed substantially from
LIFE in its recruitment criteria; only participants who reported no
difficulty in walking a quarter of a mile at baseline (i.e., at lower
risk for mobility disability) were included, whereas LIFE recruited
persons at high risk for mobility disability. In addition, Health
ABC’s end point was based on self-reported walking, not on the
completion of a 400-m walk.
Evidence from the LIFE Pilot Study showed that in participants with
BMI � 30, SPPB scores improved but walking speed did not (8). Sim-
ilarly, in this study, the LIFE trial did not find a benefit of the inter-
vention on walking speed, in general or in any obesity category. The
PA intervention did improve SPPB scores overall, but again we did
not find strong evidence that this result differed by obesity category.
There is not a simple correspondence between measured lower
extremity performance using walk speeds or performance scales and
MMD, and repeat measurements of gait can only be obtained in
those still well enough to attend assessment visits for the study. The
LIFE trial took pains to adjudicate the mobility disability status of
persons unable to attend clinic visits. Finally, the LIFE Study, being
considerably larger than previous trials, was able to quantify effects
within obesity categories with better precision.
We observed an impressive benefit in those with class 2 1 obesity
strata, but stratum-specific effects can be misleading because the
comparisons were neither preplanned nor adequately powered.
Nevertheless, exploring why this result may have arisen might help
to shape hypotheses for future research. Obesity status was strongly
linked with fewer minutes of self-reported walking at baseline. At 6
months, persons with class 1 obesity in the HE arm spontaneously
increased their minutes of walking (by 75 minutes) while the class
2 1 obesity HE participants did not report any increase in their
minutes of walking. The fact that the HE participants with class 1
obesity increased their walking may have conflated the examination
of obesity 3 intervention effect; however, participants with class
2 1 obesity showed the most improvement in overall minutes walked
per week, thus the strongest benefit on reducing risk of MMD.
Alternatively, those with class 2 1 obesity may differ from other
participants in important ways, including the number and manage-
ment of chronic health conditions and/or additional lifestyle factors
such as dietary quality and environment. For example, the preva-
lence of metabolic syndrome was higher in participants with obesity.
A previous LIFE analysis showed the LIFE intervention effect to be
greater in individuals with metabolic syndrome (13).
This study has several strengths. The LIFE Study was a multicenter
randomized intervention trial that included a diverse population of

 older adults (70-89 years old) who were at risk for MMD—a portion
of the elderly population that has received less systematic attention
in this area. Additionally, the retention and adherence were very
good (63%-73%). Few studies have examined MMD risk among
adults age 70 1 (14); none to our knowledge were large randomized
clinical trials with a follow-up of longer than 18 months. The study
used an objective and reliable method to determine MMD, an out-
come with greater clinical salience than continuous measures of gait
speed or lower extremity performance (15).
The analysis has several limitations, which should be acknowledged.
First, because the current analysis is based on a post hoc stratification
of the data, there is an increased potential for type I error. The LIFE
Study sample size was selected to provide > 80% power to detect a
21% reduction in MMD. Thus, the power in any specific obesity stra-
tum is correspondingly lower. Therefore, the failure to demonstrate a
significant effect in any particular stratum should not be taken as evi-
dence of a lack of an effect in that stratum. Correspondingly, the
study would have only power to detect large interactions between ran-
domization group and obesity status. Additionally, there was no infor-
mation collected about participation in health-promoting activities out-
side of the study, nor was there a group that received no intervention,
which may limit the interpretation of the results.
Conclusion
Older persons with obesity at high risk for mobility disability bene-
fited from a structured moderate-intensity physical activity program,
demonstrating a reduced risk of MMD. The experience of the LIFE
trial suggests that such an exercise program is both safe and effec-
tive even in persons with class 2 1 obesity. Future studies should
examine how obesity status moderates the effectiveness of physical
activity interventions, as physical activity and obesity can play an
important role in risk for MMD.O
