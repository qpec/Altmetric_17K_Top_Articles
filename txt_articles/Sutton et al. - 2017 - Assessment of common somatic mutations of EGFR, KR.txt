Abstract
Increased early detection and personalized therapy for lung cancer have coincided with
greater use of minimally invasive sampling techniques such as endobronchial ultrasound-
guided biopsy (EBUS), endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy (EUS), and navigational
biopsy, as well as thin needle core biopsies. As many lung cancer patients have late stage
disease and other comorbidities that make open surgical procedures hazardous, the least
invasive biopsy technique with the highest potential specimen yield is now the preferred first
diagnostic study. However, use of these less invasive procedures generates significant ana-
lytical challenges for the laboratory, such as a requirement for robust detection of low level
somatic mutations, particularly when the starting sample is very small or demonstrates few
intact tumor cells. In this study, we assessed 179 clinical cases of non-small cell lung carci-
noma (NSCLC) that had been previously tested for EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF muta-
tions using a novel multiplexed analytic approach that reduces wild-type signal and allows
for detection of low mutation load approaching 1%, iPLEX® HS panel for the MassARRAY®
System (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA). This highly sensitive system identified approxi-
mately 10% more KRAS, NRAS, EGFR and BRAF mutations than were detected by the
original test platform, which had a sensitivity range of 5–10% variant allele frequency (VAF).
Introduction
In 2012, an estimated 14.1 million new cancer cases were diagnosed worldwide, and this num-
ber is predicted to rise over the coming years [1]. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer
worldwide, with nearly 1.83 million new cases of lung cancer estimated to have been diagnosed

 globally in 2012. Lung cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death in the United States,
where an estimated 222,500 new cases will be diagnosed in 2017, with 155,870 deaths due to
disease [2].
Traditionally, lung cancer survival rates tend to vary markedly depending on the stage at
time of diagnosis. Unfortunately, many lung cancers are identified in the later stages of disease,
translating to lower survival rates [3, 4]. These findings suggest that treatment can be signifi-
cantly improved by detecting lung cancer tumors while they are smaller and more locally
defined [3, 4]. However, more frequent biopsy of earlier, smaller tumors and increasing use of
innovative, minimally invasive biopsy technologies have resulted in smaller samples with less
tumor tissue available for analysis.
There has been a significant expansion of targeted therapies for NSCLC that have been
shown to be effective in patients with specific genetic alterations expressed in tissue from their
lung tumor, such as selected mutations in exons 18,19, 20 and 21 of EGFR. However, as knowl-
edge of the histologic tumor type drives molecular studies, often a limited tumor sample
becomes even smaller after diagnostic immunohistochemical stains are performed to distin-
guish pulmonary adenocarcinoma (PA) from squamous cell carcinoma, or a metastatic tumor
from another organ. Any remaining tumor tissue must then be shared between multiple
molecular genetic assays. With requirements to do more with less, it has been challenging for
laboratories to establish an effective strategy for triaging specimens for molecular analysis of
lung cancer. Additionally, multiple test platforms are in use in laboratories today to detect
such mutations, many with an assay sensitivity ranging between 5 and greater than 20% vari-
ant allele frequency (VAF). Some of these test systems, such as Sanger sequencing [5,6], will
miss mutations that are present at a low VAF, or if the tumor cellularity is less than 25–40%,
both possibilities that are more likely in a limited tissue sample. In this clinical research study,
we assessed 179 clinical cases of NSCLC previously tested for EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF
mutations using a novel multiplexed analytic approach that reduces wild-type signal and
allows for detection of low mutation load approaching 1%, iPLEX1 HS panel for the MassAR-
RAY1 System (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA).
Material and methods
Lung tumor samples
Archived frozen deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples were searched for lung tumor cases
previously tested for EGFR, KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations using the OncoFOCUS™ Panel
v2.0 or v3.0 on the MassARRAY1 System (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). Speci-
mens were de-identified prior to entry into the study. DNA originated from formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human clinical PA tissue samples. Of 184 lung tumor samples, 2
were excluded from the study due to insufficient original sample to complete testing, 2 were
excluded due to iPLEX1 HS test failure, and was one excluded because of poor quality DNA
in the residual specimen. Of the 179 remaining cases, only 38 were from larger excision speci-
mens with plentiful tumor. Most specimens (129) were small biopsies, often thin caliber needle
cores, and 12 were cytology cell blocks. All histologic diagnoses were confirmed by a patholo-
gist. Most of the tumors were pure adenocarcinoma. Six cases demonstrated mixed squamous
or neuroendocrine differentiation, one showed a sarcomatoid tumor component, and 11 were
NSCLC not otherwise specified based on the available sample. Minimum tumor cellularity for
analysis was set at 20%. DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen,
Boston, MA). Prior to repeat testing, all specimens were assessed for DNA integrity using the
iPLEX1 Pro Sample ID Panel, and all specimens with adequate amplifiable DNA were then
interrogated with a new, highly sensitive single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) iPLEX1 HS

 panel that includes more than 76 common mutations [7] in BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, and
PIK3CA; both panels were run on the MassARRAY1 System. During the development of the
iPLEX1 HS chemistry a wide range of input DNA was tested (S1 Fig) and 5-10ng was found
to be the optimal starting concentration.
SNP genotyping
Genotyping of SNPs was performed using the iPLEX1 HS panel on the MassARRAY1 System
(Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), which employs matrix-assisted laser desorption/ion-
ization time-of-flight mass spectrometry for amplicon detection (MALDI-TOF-MS; Spectro-
ACQUIRE, Agena Bioscience). Primers designed for PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
amplification of specific mutations in BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA, and extension
reactions were prepared using the MassARRAY1 Assay Design Version 3.1 software (Agena
Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). PCR reactions contained: Taq DNA polymerase (Agena
Bioscience), genomic DNA (5–10 ng), PCR primers, and dNTP. Following PCR (45 cycles),
the remaining dNTPs were removed by the addition of alkaline phosphatase (Agena Biosci-
ence), after which the plates were incubated at 37˚C for 40 min. (as previously described in
[8]).
iPLEX1 HS chemistry is a wild-type (WT) terminator-depleted chemistry designed to
reduce the wild-type extension terminator signal in a DNA specimen. This allows for quantifi-
cation of a mutation down to a very low variant allele frequency (VAF) as the analytical win-
dow is not dominated by the wild-type allele (S2 Fig). Following the PCR reaction, SAP
addition, and iPLEX HS1 extension reaction, the samples were desalted by resin treatment for
15 min, spotted onto SpectroCHIP1 Arrays (Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA), analyzed by
mass spectrometer, and ultimately interpreted on SpectroTYPER v4.0 software (Agena Biosci-
ence, San Diego, CA). A mutation signal produced using iPLEX1 HS chemistry can be reliably
detected by the MassARRAY1 System at about 1% VAF (see Fig 1). iPLEX1 HS assays can be
performed within 8 hrs from DNA to reportable result, which is amenable to requirements for
turnaround time currently in place for lung cancer tumor mutation analysis in clinical labora-
tories [9]. For an overview of these experimental processes, see Fig 2.
Digital droplet PCR
The QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System reaction was performed in biological triplicates per
manufacturer’s instructions for use [10]. The ddPCR contained 10 uL of the various genomic
mixes, 12.5 uL ddPCR super mix, and 2.5 uL primer/probe mix. Primers and TaqMan probes
for KRAS (G12C, G13D, G12D, G13C, G12V), EGFR (L858R), NRAS (G13R), and BRAF
(V600E) mutations were purchased from existing mutation assays from Bio-Rad (Hercules,

 CA). PCR components were separated into individual reaction vessels using the QX100 Drop-
let Generator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The droplet generation process combines 70 uL of
droplet generation oil with 20 uL of the ddPCR. This process was performed in a cartridge
with a cartridge holder and droplet generation gasket. Subsequent to droplet formation, 40 uL
of the formed droplet reaction was transferred from the cartridge to a 96-well PCR plate.
Amplification parameters were as follows: 95˚C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 94˚C
for 30 seconds, and 55˚C for 1 minute. Cycling was followed by 98˚C incubation for 10 min-
utes. Annealing temperature was experimentally defined [10]. After the reaction, t he droplets
were read using the Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad), and QuantaSoft software version 1.4.0.99 (Bio-
Rad) converted the data into concentrations using Poisson distribution statistical analysis.
Results
High sensitivity iPLEX® HS somatic mutation detection
In 179 samples, mutations in KRAS (n = 55; 55/179 = 30.7%), BRAF (n = 8; 8/179 = 4.5%),
EGFR (n = 19; 19/179 = 10.6%), and NRAS (n = 3; 3/179 = 1.7%) were detected using iPLEX1
HS chemistry, for a total of 85 mutations observed. This correlates well with other reports of
genetic analysis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, where mutation frequencies range from 10–
21% of tumors with mutated EGFR, 25–33% of tumors with mutated KRAS, and 2–10% with
mutated BRAF, while NRAS mutations are rare, depending on the patient population studied
[3,11,12,13]. When compared to previous results from the OncoFOCUSTM Panel, which has a
sensitivity of approximately 5–10% VAF, this represents an additional 17 previously unde-
tected mutations (17/179, or 9.5% more mutations detected). The mass spectra from the origi-
nal runs were reviewed, and several mutations were considered suspect but unconfirmed due
to weak spectral peaks or low confidence calls by the system software (See Table 1, S1 Table).
However, some of the new mutations could not be identified in the original data run (See
Table 1, S1 Table). Therefore, by improving the level of detection from 5–10% down to 1–5%,
we confirmed 8 mutations that were previously considered probable in the original data,
including two EGFR L858R mutations (Table 1). An example of spectral data comparison

 from the same sample run on both OncoFOCUS™ and iPLEX1 HS panels is shown in Fig 3. In
two cases a second previously undetected mutation was identified, while an additional 6 new
KRAS mutations, 2 NRAS, 1 BRAF, and 1 EGFR mutation were identified (See Table 1). While
3 of these cases originated from larger excision specimens, the most common sample type
where an additional mutation was identified was a needle core biopsy, and 2 cases originated
from cytology cell blocks (See Table 1). Additionally, 4/179, or 2% of cases demonstrated a
mutation in PIK3CA, which was not interrogated by the OncoFOCUSTM Panel. This mutation
frequency is similar to other reports [11,12]. Sensitivity of the iPLEX1 HS panel was con-
firmed by testing dilution series of specimens with known mutant allele vs. WT copy number
prepared using commercial DNA standards (Horizon Discovery-Boston, Cambridge MA); see
Fig 1.

 Digital droplet verification
Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) was used to verify the new mutations which were identified
using the iPLEX1 HS panel but which were previously unconfirmed or not detected by Onco-
FOCUS™ Panel analysis. Using the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System we performed tests in
biological triplicates per manufacturer’s instructions for use (9). Rare event detection assays
were employed for both mutation and WT probes for KRAS (G12C, G13D, G12D, G13C,
G12V), EGFR (L858R), NRAS (G13R), and BRAF (V600E) mutations (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
(Fig 4). As a positive control a dilution series of mutant allele vs. WT copy number was pre-
pared using commercial DNA standards [KRAS (G12C, G13D, G12D, G13C, G12V), EGFR
(L858R), and BRAF (V600E); (Horizon Discovery-Boston, Cambridge MA) (Fig 4, S1 Table).
We positively identified and confirmed all 10 previously undetected mutations, thereby verify-
ing the iPLEX1 HS detection chemistry (Fig 4, S1 Table).
Discussion
Early detection and appropriate testing of lung cancer is of vital importance to improving
patient outcomes. This consequently places a considerable burden on pathologists to ensure
that specimens used for molecular testing meet the laboratory’s requirements for tumor con-
tent and quality. However, this can be challenging. Other groups have shown that tissue

 specimens with low tumor cellularity may lead to false-negative mutation results, particularly
if an assay has a relatively low analytic sensitivity, such as Sanger sequencing [5,6]. This prob-
lem may be encountered with any small, limited tumor tissue sample. Dudley et al [14]
reported that tumor cell depletion by neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma could
impede detection of KRAS mutations. Chen et al [15] demonstrated that detection of BRAF
mutations in lymph nodes involved with metastatic malignant melanoma was particularly

 challenging when there was a low tumor cell burden, such as with small subcapsular metastatic
deposits or infiltrative tumor cells in a background of small lymphocytes. The use of a highly
sensitive molecular assay is critical for accurate assessment of such specimens. In this clinical
research study, we demonstrate similar findings for mutation analysis in NSCLC. By increas-
ing the assay sensitivity from 5–10% VAF detection to 1%, the iPLEX1 HS panel and MassAR-
RAY1 System resulted in the identification of 17 (17/179, or 9.5%) previously undetected
KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and EGFR mutations. Furthermore, with an 8 hour turnaround time and
low per sample cost, we can perform targeted screens on more samples with a higher level of
detection and thereby potentially discover mutations at an earlier stage.
We also show that low VAF mutations can be reliably detected in small tissue samples, such
as needle core biopsies and cytology cell block specimens, which are increasingly seen in clini-
cal molecular pathology laboratories.
