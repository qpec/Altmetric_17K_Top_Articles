Aim: To design a theranostic capsule using the virus-like nanoparticle of the hepatitis 
E virus modified to display breast cancer cell targeting functional group (LXY30). 
Methods: Five surface-exposed residues were mutated to cysteine to allow conjugation 
to maleimide-linked chemical groups via thiol-selective linkages. Engineered virus-like 
nanoparticles were then covalently conjugated to a breast cancer recognized ligand, 
LXY30 and an amine-coupled near-infrared fluorescence dye. Results: LXY30-HEV 
VLP was checked for its binding and entry to a breast cancer cell line and for tumor 
targeting in vivo to breast cancer tissue in mice. The engineered virus-like nanoparticle 
not only targeted cancer cells, but also appeared immune silent to native hepatitis E 
virus antibodies due to epitope disruption at the antibody-binding site. Conclusion: 
These results demonstrate the production of a theranostic capsule suitable for cancer 
diagnostics and therapeutics based on surface modification of a highly stable virus-like 
nanoparticle.

Background
Cancer theranostics require specific target-
ing of drug/diagnostic element to tumor cells 
specifically, without binding to or affect-
ing healthy cells and tissues. Most delivery 
systems provide feasible, yet low specificity, 
solutions. They are usually based on lipo-
some and/or organic polymers such as poly-
ethylene glycol. Virus-like particles (VLPs) 
have been used as nanocarriers to display 
foreign epitopes and/or deliver small mol-
ecules in a highly specific manner for use as 
vaccines or therapeutic agents against disease 
phenotypes [1]. This is facilitated mainly by 
their ability to self-assemble and the ease 
of genetically modifying them. Hepatitis 
E virus (HEV) is composed of a nonenvel-
oped icosahedral capsid, enclosing a single-
stranded RNA genome of 7.2 kilobases [2]. 
The major capsid protein is encoded by the 
second open reading frame (ORF2) and is 
essential not only for virus assembly, but also 
for immunogenicity and host interaction [3]. 
The recombinant capsid protein (CP) is able 
to self-assemble into virus-like particles when 
expressed in insect cells after deletion of 111 
amino acids from the N-terminal end and 
52 amino acids from the C-terminal end. 
CP folds into three domains: S (shell; amino 
acids 118-317), M (middle; amino acids 
318-451) and P (protruding; amino acids 
452-606 [4–6].
The S-domain forms a typical antiparal-
lel beta-barrel structure and assembles into 
stable icosahedral shell, while the P-domain 
protrudes as a surface spike that pro-
foundly determines HEV antigenicity. The 
M-domain appears as plateau residing at 
the threefold of the icosahedral capsid and 
the function is not known yet. With three-

domain modularity, HEV-VLP can easily maneuver its 
assembly with antigenicity, in other words, size reduc-
tion from T = 3 to T = 1 icosahedral particle without 
changing in antigenicity [7]. Administration of HEV-
VLP in nonhuman primates elicits both systemic and 
mucosal immunity with undetectable tolerance, as well 
as protection against HEV challenge [8]. Moreover, it 
can accommodate sequence modification at P-domain 
without interference with HEV-VLP assembly. Geneti-
cally engineered chimeric VLPs having modifications 
in the somewhat isolated protrusion domain, are as 
stable as wild-type VLPs [9], and like the HEV virion, 
can tolerate extreme pH values and intestinal prote-
ases [10]. This has exciting implications for an orally 
deliverable chemotherapeutic agent. All this evidence 
makes it feasible to use the HEV-VLP as a scaffold 
for modification of its protrusion domain as exterior 
contact points for cancer targeting (for diagnostics or 
therapeutics). The functionalized VLP can encapsu-
late drugs, DNA/RNA or inorganic beads as targeted 
cargo delivery system.
In this study, we created a theranostic capsule whose 
targeting specificity was altered by chemically conju-
gating the targeting ligand onto its exterior surface. 
Specifically, HEV-VLP was engineered to have an 
exposed cysteine residue in one of the surface variable 
loops of the P-domain. Of the five mutants generated, 
the N573C was found to be most suited for conjuga-
tion of chemical groups by a thiol-selective reaction 
and subsequent secondary binding of ligands to the 
conjugated groups. The LXY30 ligand peptide was 
conjugated to the N573C-VLP, allowing enhanced 
affinity to human malignant breast tumor cells [11] as 
well as in vivo to tumor tissue, indicating that delivery 
route of virus-like particle can be manipulated to facili-
tate targeted delivery to pathologic foci.
Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis of the P domain of 
dORF2-HEV
Five amino acid residues (Y485, T489, S533, N573 and 
T586) of the P-domain were individually mutated to 
a cysteine residue by site-directed mutagenesis using a 
QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) 
following the manufacturer’s protocols. The baculovi-
rus transfer vector carrying the dORF2 gene (pFast-
Bac1/dORF2-HEV) was used as template for the site-
directed mutagenesis [12]. These residues were chosen 
for mutagenesis on the basis of the dimer model and 
crucial binding site information of HEV [13]. The for-
ward and reverse primers for each site-directed muta-
genesis reaction are shown in Supplementary Table 1. 
The mutated pFastBac1/dORF2-HEV plasmids car-
rying the site mutations Y485, T489, S533, N573 and 
T586 were named pFastBac1/dORF2-HEV-Y485, 
-T489, -S533, -N573 and -T586, respectively. The 
authenticity of each mutation in these plasmids was 
confirmed by sequencing of both strands.
Production & purification of HEV-Cys-VLPs  
& in vitro disassembly
The mutated CP was expressed in insect High Five 
cells (Invitrogen™, CA, USA) using baculovirus-
based expression vectors. The recombinant baculovi-
ruses used to express the mutated CPs were generated 
using the Bac-to-Bac® Baculovirus Expression System 
on Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) and each of the pFastBac1/
dORF2-HEV plasmids described above according 
to the protocols supplied by the manufacturer. The 
Sf9 and High Five cells were maintained on ESF921 
medium (Expression Systems, CA USA) and Excell 
420 medium (SAFC Biosciences, KS, USA) supple-
mented with 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum 
(FBS), respectively, following standard protocols [14]. 
The production and purification of HEV-Cys-VLPs 
from the various mutated POR2 constructs were con-
ducted as described previously [15]. In order to express 
the mutated POR2 proteins and generate VLPs, the 
High Five cells were inoculated with each baculovi-
rus construct at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and 
cultured for 6–7 days. The VLPs were collected and 
purified through multiple steps of CsCl equilibrium 
density-gradient ultracentrifugation as described pre-
viously [16]. The purified VLPs were resuspended in 
10 mM potassium-MES buffer, pH = 6.2 and stored 
at 4°C. The purified VLPs were disrupted by dialy-
sis against buffer containing EDTA (10 mM) or/and 
DTT (20 mM). A mini dialysis device (Millipore) was 
used in the disassembly experiments.
Chemical conjugation of maleimide-linked 
biotin onto HEV-Cys VLPs via thiol reaction
Maleimide-linked biotin (20–200 μM) was used to 
react with HEV-Cys VLPs (4–40 μM) in 0.01 M PBS, 
pH = 7.2 at 4°C overnight. Unbound maleimide-bio-
tin was then removed using a 7000 MWCO desalting 
column (Zeba™ Spin Desalting Columns, Thermo 
Scientific, MA, USA).
Preparation of LXY30-VLP–Cy5.5 complexes 
for flow cytometric analysis, cell tests & in vivo 
imaging on mice
Six hundred fifty micrometers maleimide-azide and 650 
μM alkyne-LXY30 in the presence of 200 μM CuSO4 
and 1 mM ascorbic acid were incubated at 4°C over-
night. Then maleimide-conjugated LXY30 was added 
at molar ratio of 3:1 (ligand vs binding site) to react with 
the Cys residues on HEV-Cys mutants though a thiol

To chemically conjugate Cy5.5 NHS ester 
(Limiprobe) to HEV-Cys VLPs, Cy5.5 NHS ester 
(200 nM) was used to react with HEV-Cys mutants

containing 0.01 M PBS, pH = 7.2 at room tempera-
ture for 2 h, followed by incubation at 4°C overnight. 
The free Cy5.5 NHS ester was then removed by a

Flow cytometric analysis
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were incubated 
with Cy5.5-labeled HEV-573C-VLPs (VLP-Cy5.5) or 
Cy5.5/LXY30-conjugated HEV-573C-VLPs (LXY3-
VLP-Cy5.5) for 1 h at 37°C, respectively. Then the 
cells were washed with PBS three times and resus-
pended in PBS for the flow cytometric analysis [11]. A 
total of 10,000 events were collected for each sample. 
Unstained cells were used as a control.
Confocal microscopy
The sample preparation was performed according to 
previously established protocol [16]. Briefly, MDA-
MB-231 breast cancer cells were seeded in the cover-
glass chamber slides (VWR LabShop, IL, USA). After 
reaching 80% confluence, the cells were incubated with 
Cy5.5-labeled HEV-573C-VLPs (VLP-Cy5.5) and 
Cy5.5-labeled LXY30-conjugated HEV-573C-VLPs 
(LXY3-VLP-Cy5.5), respectively for 1 h at 37°C. The 
cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitro-
gen) for 5 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS 
and replaced with fresh medium before observation 
under a Zeiss confocal fluorescence microscope.

under pathogen-free conditions according to Associa-
tion for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory 
Animal Care (AAALAC) guidelines and were allowed 
to acclimatize for at least 4 days prior to any experi-
ments. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (5 × 105) 
were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude 
mice. All animal experiments were performed in com-
pliance with institutional guidelines and according to 
protocol no. 17222 approved by the Animal Use and 
Care Administrative Advisory Committee at the Uni-
versity of California, Davis. MDA-MB-231 tumors 
bearing mice were intravenously injected through the 
tail vein with 4 nmol/l Cy5.5 fluorescent-labeled HEV-
573C-VLPs (VLP-Cy5.5) and LXY30-conjugated 
HEV-573C-VLPs (LXY30-VLP-Cy5.5), respectively. 
At different time point (1, 6, 24 and 48 h post-injec-
tion), the mice were scanned with Kodak imaging sys-
tem IS2000MM according to the procedure described 
previously [17]. Imaging was collected with an exci-
tation bandpass filter at 625 nm and an emission at 
700 nm at exposure time 30 s per image. After in vivo 
imaging, animals were euthanized by CO2 overdose at 
72 h after injection. Tumors, organs and muscle tissues 
were excised and imaged with Kodak imaging station.
Preparation of VLP–Fab complexes for 
cryoelectron microscopy
The VLP–Fab complexes were prepared by incubat-
ing VLPs and Fabs at a molar ratio of 1:180 at 4°C 
overnight. Free Fab was removed by passing VLP–Fab 
complex through a short Sephacryl-300 gel-filtration 
column. Optical density readings at a wavelength of 
280 nm were used to select the fractions that contained 
VLP–Fab complexes.
Transmission electron microscopy
The purified VLPs were stained with 2% uranyl ace-
tate and examined under a JOEL JEM-1230 trans-
mission electron microscope at the magnifications 
of 30,000. Procedures for cryo-electron microscopy

Fab fragments of HEP230 is displayed as isosurface along a fivefold axis, which shows extra density (red arrow) in 
the gap of two fivefold-related protruding dimers (A). The density is in good agreement to the footprint of Fab 
molecule (B). Residue N573 (sphere mode) is located next to the binding site of HEP230 (C) that allows only one 
Fab molecule binding per fivefold region (D).

Chemically activatable viral capsid functionalized for cancer targeting    Research Article
(cryo-EM) were essentially similar to that described 
previously [18]. Briefly, 3 μl of VLP–Fab complex 
was applied to a holey carbon-coated copper grid, 
and rapidly plunged into liquid ethane after blotting 
away the excess liquid. The frozen-hydrated VLP–Fab 
complex was then transferred into a transmission elec-
tron microscope (JEM-2100F, JEOL) equipped with a 
Gatan 626DH cryo holder and examined under at liq-
uid nitrogen temperature. Micrographs were acquired 
under minimal dose system (<10 e/A [1]) on a Tem-
Cam-F415 CCD camera (TVIPS) at a pixel size of 2 at 
the specimen space.
Image processing
Particles were then manually selected and initially 
center and orientation was determined by reference-
dependent cross-correlation by using a density of the 
wild-type HEV-VLP [19] as our initial model. Polar 
Fourier transformation algorithm [20] was used to itera-
tively carry out origin and orientation refinement. The 
contrast transfer function was determined and phase 
correction was applied to the data used for structural 
determination. 3D reconstructions were computed 
by combining a set of particles with orientations that 
spread evenly in an icosahedral asymmetric unit with 
superimposing the 5-3-2 icosahedral symmetry. The 
reliability of the reconstruction was assessed with clas-
sical Fourier Shall Correction and the final resolution 
was determined at 15 using 0.5 as cut-off.
Fitting of the crystal structure into cryo-
electron microscopy density maps
Molecular docking was carried out with rigid body fit-
ting the cryo-EM density map with the HEV decamer 
that is composed of ten of the CP (PDB 2ZZQ) using 
program O [21]. The fitting was evaluated based on the

Two methods have been tested in this research. Method 1: the copper catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition 
reaction between Mal-azide and alkyne-LXY30 to form Mal-linked LXY30 (Mal-LXY30) was done first. Then the 
Mal-LXY30 was added to react with Cys of N573C-VLPs (A). The LXY30 and Cy5.5 decorated N573C-VLP (LXY30-
VLP-Cy5.5) remained intact after all these chemical conjugation processes (B). Method 2: the conjugation process 
starting by labeling Mal-linked azide (Mal-azide) at Cys sites of N573C-VLPs through thiol-selective reaction to 
build azide-linked VLPs (azide-VLPs), followed by adding LXY30-alkyne, ascorbic acid and CuSO4 to form LXY30-
linked VLPs (LXY30-VLPs) (A). However, most LXY30-VLPs were damaged or disassembled from the conjugation 
processes, which may be caused by the reactive reactants including azide, ascorbic acid and CuSO4 (C).

Results
Cysteine replacement at the surface loops of 
the P-domain
As the structure of HEV-VLP was previously estab-
lished in the lab at atomic resolution [22], it was prac-
tical to select five sites for cysteine replacement from 
the surface variable loops of the P-domain (Figure 1). 
These sites were selected based on their location as well 
as the feasibility of sequence mutation to minimize any 
possible distortion of VLP assembly. As expected, indi-
vidual cysteine replacement at Y485, T489, S533, N573 
and T586 did not alter VLP morphology as the elec-
tron microscopy micrographs of HEV-Cys VLPs were 
not discernible from previously described HEV-VLP 
projections of 27 nm in diameter (data not shown).
To evaluate the availability for cysteine acylation, 
conjugation efficiency was first demonstrated between 
HEV-Cys VLP and maleimide-biotin, resulting in 
VLP biotinylation through an irreversible reaction 
between the maleimide and thiol group of cysteine. 
Among all five mutant VLPs, the VLP with a cyste-
ine replacement at N573 (N573C-VLP) appeared to 
exhibit the most significant streptavidin signal follow-
ing malimide–biotin conjugation (Figure 2A) Further-
more, dissembled N573C-VLP bound to malimide–
biotin displayed similar streptavidin signal to the 
other disassembled VLP mutants (Figure 2A.) Because 
conjugation to N573C VLP resulted in the most expo-
sure for secondary binding, N573C VLP was used for 
follow-up investigation.
The chimeric virus-like particle carrying a 
N573C mutation was unable to react with 
Hepatitis E virus antibody
Because the P-domain carries the antigenic structure of 
HEV, sequence mutation may alter the immunoreac-
tivity of HEV antibodies against the obtained chimeric 
VLPs. To get an insight into the antigenicity of the chi-
meric VLPs to specific HEV antibodies, we compared 
the antigenicity of the chimeric N573CVLP to the 
wild-type HEV-VLP in the presence or absence of bio-
tin conjugation. An ELISA plate was coated with mal-
biotin-conjugated and nonconjugated N573C-VLP as 
well as WT HEV-VLP, followed by incubation with 
two monoclonal antibodies, HEP230 or HEP40-4. In 
contrast to HEP40-4, HEP230 recognized only the 
wild-type HEV-VLP and failed to recognize N573C-
VLP regardless of biotin conjugation (Figure 2B). The 
ELISA against the mixture of HEP230 and HEP40-4 
showed similar trend to that previously reported for 
antibody HEP224 [19]. The data also suggest that 
residue N573 is critical to HEP230 binding.
Residue N573 is involved in antibody HEP230 
binding
All of the proposed mutation residues reside in flexible 
loops of the P-domain, in which residues Y485, T489 
and T586 are exposed on the outermost surface while 
residues S533 and N573 are located at the stem region 
of the P-domain (Figure 1B). To understand the role 
of residue N573 in HEP230 binding, we determined

the complex structure of HEV-VLP with the Fab of 
HEP230 by cryo-EM and image processing.
N573C VLPs in complex with Fab of HEP230 
(Fab230) appeared to resemble the morphology of HEV-
VLP, exhibit homogeneous size distribution in cryo-
electron micrographs. 3D reconstruction was calculated 
with superimposing icosahedral symmetry, indicating 
the 60 antibody-binding sites on each VLP were not 
fully occupied by Fab230. It revealed that HEV-VLP 
contained protruding spikes, each of which extend 
outward along icosahedral twofold axis (Figure 3A). As 
opposed to the native HEV-VLP, these spikes appeared 
to connect with each other around the icosahedral five-
fold axis. The connection density between the spikes 
was much weaker than the capsid and was not big 
enough to accommodate the Fab molecule. However, 
the size of the connection density appeared to be in 
good agreement with the contacting surface of the Fab 
molecule (Figure 3B), indicating that the Fab230 may 
contact VLP at this position. This finding subsequently 
validated the fivefold and threefold symmetries from 3D 
reconstruction, in other words, using 2-2-2 symmetry 
instead of 5-3-2 symmetry during image processing. 
After five iterations of refinement, a single, slander den-
sity was observed extending from the same site of the 
P-domain inwardly toward the fivefold axis (data not 
shown). This helped to confirm that Fab230 binds to 
this region. Model docking with the crystal structure of 
a Fab fragment (PDB 3RKD) of HEV antibody 8C11 
revealed that the extra density did cover the three con-
tact loops in the Fab (Figure 3C). Docking the crystal 
structure of HEV CP (PDB 1ZZQ) into the density 
map revealed that residue N573 is in the binding foot-
print of Fab230 (Figure 3C & D), and could be in direct 
contact with the residues from Fab230.

To assess the targeting and diagnostic capability of 
N573-VLP, a breast cancer cell targeting ligand, 
LXY30, was chemically added to the surface N573C-
VLPs through a cysteine-anchored melamine-alkyne.

breast cancer cells [11]. Although LXY30-maleimide 
coupling provides one-step conjugation to N573-VLP, 
click chemistry was introduced to conjugate ligand to 
VLP, as an attempt of ligation to a variety of molecules, 
especially the synthetic peptides or oligosaccharides. As 
the anchor, maleimide-azide coupling with VLP can be 
performed prior to cycloaddition with alkyne-linked 
ligand (method 2), or after cycloaddition (method 1) 
(Figure 4A). Our results showed that the method 1 
did not cause VLP deformation (Figure 4B), while the 
method 2 disrupted VLP (Figure 4C). Flow cytometry 
revealed a significantly higher attachment (more than 
fivefolds) for LXY30-VLPs to MDA-MB-231 breast 
cancer cells, as compared with that for the wild-type 
VLPs (Figure 5A), indicating that LXY30-VLP specifi-
cally targets breast cancer cells.
To determine if LXY30-VLPs enters the MDA-
MB-231 cells, the distribution of CP was observed after 
incubation of LXY30-VLPs and MDA-MB-231 cells by 
the confocal microscopy. For this imaging, the LXY30-
VLPs were labeled with the near infrared dye, Cy5.5, 
and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cells at 37°C for 
1 h. As shown in Figure 5B, most Cy5.5-labeled VLPs 
distributed around the perinuclear region of MDA-
MB-231 cells, which meant the VLP was internalized 
into the cytoplasm. Wild-type VLPs had minimal cellu-
lar uptake, whereas LXY30-VLPs exhibited significantly 
higher uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5B). These 
results demonstrated that the chemical conjugation with 
target ligand is capable of eliciting the specific uptake of 
HEV-VLP into breast cancer cells.
Targeting of LXY30-conjugated N573C  
virus-like particles in breast tumor in vivo
Noninvasive in vivo imaging has been shown to be 
a powerful tool to visually monitor the delivery of 
therapeutic reagents. In vivo near infrared (NIR) opti-
cal imaging was used to investigate the distribution 
of the VLPs in nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 
breast cancer xenografts, as a criterion to evaluate the 
specificity of tumor targeting. Both Cy5.5-labeled 
LXY30-VLPs and the Cy5.5-labeled wild-type VLPs 
were intravenously injected via tail vein in nude mice 
bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts, respectively. The 
mice were scanned with the fluorescence imager at 
various intervals for up to 72 h. Both Cy5.5-labeled 
wild-type VLPs and LXY30-VLPs distributed 
throughout the body of the mice immediately after

or glycoproteins by chemical conjugation. HEV VLPs also possess relatively large interior volumes that can be 
loaded with a variety of materials, including DNA plasmids. In comparison with other VLPs, HEV VLPs possess 
strong structural plasticity, with a stability switch sensitive to calcium concentration.

the intravenous injection, and gradually accumulated 
into the MDA-MB-231 tumor via the enhanced per-
meability and retention effect. However, the uptake 
rate of LXY30-VLPs in the tumor site was faster than 
that of wild-type VLPs. The fluorescence intensity of 
Cy5.5-labeled LXY30-VLPs in MDA-MB-231 tumor 
was significantly higher than that of Cy5.5-labeled 
wild-type VLPs at 1 and 6 h post-injection (Figure 6). 
HEV, as an enteric transmitted virus, preferentially 
enters hepatocytes in liver. It is not surprising that 
Cy5.5-labeled VLPs accumulated within 1 h at the 
abdominal organs including liver. Ex vivo imaging of 
excised organs was performed at 72 h post-injection. 
The remaining signal of Cy5.5 was found dominantly 
at liver and kidney, however, appeared weak in excised 
tumor (data not shown). The high uptake in liver 
and kidney could be explained in part as leaking of 
the breakdown VLPs from circulating vessels. Over-
all, these results indicate that Cy5.5/LXY30-linked 
HEV-VLPs are able to relatively target MDA-MB-231 
xenografts in vivo.
Discussion
For diseases such as cancer, the need of the hour is to 
formulate drug delivery modalities that have the abil-
ity of tumor-specific targeting. The VLP is a platform 
that provides not only the solution of cargo encapsula-
tion, but also an opportunity for tissue/cell-specific 
approaches while minimizing the overall damage to 
healthy cells [23,24]. Compared with other nano-deliv-
ery systems that have a limited half-life due to early 
degradation, HEV is a feco-orally transmitted virus, 
and HEV-VLPs, which resemble the virus, can main-
tain their structure through a variety of harsh envi-
ronmental conditions. The stable nature of the capsid 
implies that the VLP does not require refrigeration for 
storage. Previous studies from our lab have also dem-
onstrated that chimeric HEV-VLPs retain their state 
of assembly even on exposure to intestinal proteases 
like trypsin [10]. This implies that the theranostic cap-
sule can be delivered orally. There is an immense ease 
in oral administration of cancer therapy, particularly 
for patients who are unfit for clinic visits and repeated

vein punctures. This stability is particularly advanta-
geous in the context of increased bioavailability when 
used as an oral chemotherapeutic agent. HEV-VLPs 
could thus have a higher propensity for efficient deliv-
ery and reduced accumulation due to particle degra-
dation [14], both properties being critical factors for 
therapeutic nanocarriers.
The baculovirus expression vector-based produc-
tion of CP in commercially available insect High Five 
cells generates HEV-Cys-VLP capsid protein that is 
easily purified at high yield and low cost [25]. In con-
trast, many other nanodelivery systems are compro-
mised due to variable expression levels and inefficiency 
in production.
Common bioconjugation reactions involve ligation 
to lysine residues with NHS or to cysteine residues 
with maleimide. The former approach is nonspecific 
because there are many lysine residues on proteins. 
Here a cysteine residue was genetically engineered to 
be exposed on the surface of the HEV-VLP P-domain, 
allowing acylation to anchor an external ligand to a 
single, most exterior site. To avoid the competition, 
the conjugation of a near-infrared dye, Cy 5.5 was per-
formed by amine-coupling, with the purpose to detect 
VLP distribution in cells and in vivo.
Five sites were chosen for replacement with cys-
teine – these were Y485C, T489C, S533C, N573C 
and T586C (Figure 7). The mutant constructs were 
seen to retain their ability to form VLPs, as observed 
by transmission electron microscopy. The mutants 
were conjugated to biotin-maleimide, their usabil-
ity as theranostic capsules was assessed based on 
accessibility of the conjugated biotin to its ligand, 
streptavidin. Among all of the chimeric VLPs that 
we generated, N573C-VLP construct appeared to 
show the strongest streptavidin binding, despite 
the fact that the cysteine thiol group is embedded 
within the surface depression at icosahedral fivefold 
axis. Structural analysis revealed that the distance 
between N573C and its fivefold related neighboring 
N573C is 45A, a distance that is in a good agree-
ment with the length of a streptavidin monomer. In 
fact, the streptavidin is a homotetramer in solution. 
The streptavidin homotetramer can intercalate into 
the surface depression and form multivalent interac-
tion with N573C-anchored biotin molecules, which 
largely reduces the rate of dissociation. As a result, 
the avidity of streptavidin to N573C-VLP is the 
highest although the affinity of streptavidin to a sin-
gle biotin appeared to be the same as it showed by its 
binding to the disassembled VLPs. By contrast, the 
quaternary arrangement of cysteine residues in the 
other chimeric VLPs does not support multivalent 
binding of streptavidin.
HEV-N573C-VLP was subsequently found effec-
tive in avoiding nonspecific ligand bindings to the 
HEV P-domain, although the four endogenous lysine 
residues were potentially accessible from the capsid 
surface. In conjunction with cysteine conjugation, 
alkylation was used to simultaneously bind fluores-
cent molecules to exposed lysine residues for VLP 
tracking.
The N573 residue is located within the binding 
footprint of the Fab230, so that mutation of N573 
blocks the interaction of CP and HEP230. However, 
the volume of a fivefold depression is not sufficient 
so as to simultaneously accommodate five Fab mol-
ecules. Thus, the structure of Fab-bound VLP can 
only capture the contacting region of the Fab mol-
ecule after icosahedral average. The density is about 
20% occupancy to that of the capsid, suggesting that 
only one Fab molecule resided at each fivefold axis. 
This is consistent with the nonicosahedral symmetry 
averaged density map. This binding site is different 
to our previously reported binding site for antibody 
HEP224, whose binding depends critically on resi-
due Y485 of CP [26]. The reconstruction of HEP224-
bound VLP revealed density of 60 Fabs at the shoul-
der of the P-domain with Fab extending away from 
VLP center [26]. This suggests of two distinctive anti-
genic domains on the surface of HEV-VLP that do 
not overlap with each other; in agreement with the 
results of ELISA [19]and mutagenesis result [13] that 
were previously reported for HEV.
After extensive characterization of the HEV-
N573C-VLP, we conjugated it to a breast cancer tar-
geting ligand, LXY30, by thiol-selective coupling. 
LXY30 is a ligand for binding to integrin α-3 (ITGA3 
or CD49C), and is highly overexpressed on the surface 
of breast carcinoma tissues [11]. The LXY30 HEV-VLP 
was subsequently labeled to fluorophore Cy5.5 to trace 
its trafficking in cells and in vivo. To this end, we found 
the binding of the LXY30-conjugated HEV-VLPs to 
be significantly higher on the surface of breast cancer 
cell line MDA-MB-231, as compared with unconju-
gated, Cy5.5-labeled VLP. Further, internalized VLP 
was largely perinuclear, and internalization of LXY30-
conjugated VLPs was significantly more as compared 
with the unconjugated VLP.
Last, we administered the conjugated or unconju-
gated VLP in mice that had previously received a xeno-
graft of breast cancer cells. The LXY30-conjugated 
VLP accumulated in the tumor tissue at a higher level 
as compared with unconjugated VLP. However, there 
was significant nonspecific uptake of the capsule in 
liver and kidney, and this would pose as a serious side 
effect for medical applications. This problem could be 
solved by a variety of approaches [27,28], including fur-

ther engineering of the VLP surface. We are currently 
in the process of evaluating one such modification, for 
better targeting to cancer cells with nonspecific tissue 
accumulation in vivo.
Conclusion
We developed an orally deliverable, protein-based 
nanoparticle based on the structure of hepatitis E 
virus. The capsid protein was expressed in insect cells 
to produce the VLP carrying the site-directed cysteine 
mutation in one of the five designated loops on the 
protrusion domain. This allowed surface modifica-
tion through thiol-based coupling to the mutated and 
surface-exposed cysteine residue. Of the five mutants, 
we found that N573C showed the maximum degree of 
surface conjugation, although all the mutants formed 
VLPs. We conjugated the breast cancer-targeting 
ligand LXY30 to the N573C VLP, and amine coupled 
a NIR dye to track the VLP movement. The LXY30 
VLP bound to breast cancer cells in culture to a much 
higher extent as compared to unconjugated VLP. Fur-
thermore, it targeted the breast cancer tissue in vivo 
more efficiently than the unconjugated VLP. This plat-
form will enable oral administration of a cheap cancer-
targeting nanoparticle that can carry therapeutic or 
diagnostic agents
Future perspective
A modularized theranostic capsule, targeting breast 
tumor, was constructed to demonstrate the potential 
cancer diagnostic and potential therapeutic applica-
tion utilizing an HEV-VLP platform. Besides conju-
gating the cancer cell targeting ligand on the surface, 
the utilization of modularized theranostic capsule can 
be expanded by using the interior space of Cys-VLPs 
as well. Citric acid coated ferrite particles had been 
successfully encapsulated into HEV-VLPs using in 
vitro capsid reassembly, which can be detected in mice 
by MRI. It could also be applied to tumor-targeted 
hyperthermia induced by ultrasound or radio fre-
quency electromagnetic radiation using heat-activated 
ferrite particles encapsulated in the tumor-targeted 
theroanostic capsule [29]. Another exciting applica-
tion to be explored is based on the prior finding that 
negatively charged micro-RNA/siRNA could be also 
encapsulated into the interior of HEV-Cys-VLPs [30]. 
Packaging the micro-RNA/siRNA targeting genes to 
be silenced interiorly, the proposed therapeutic cap-
sule can be an effective carrier for cancer-targeted gene 
therapy (Figure 8). By binding the cancer cell targeting 
ligand on its surface, HEV-Cys-VLP could have poten-
tial applications in cancer cell targeting gene therapy; 
consequently, this would improve current treatments 
used in cancer patients.

Executive summary
Background
• Genetically engineered hepatitis E virus (HEV) virus-like particles (VLPs) can be surface modified without 
compromising their stability.
• Either of five key residues of the surface variable loops of the HEV capsid protein was replaced with cysteine 
to allow thiol-selective conjugation between maleimide and cysteine.
Methods
• Either of five sites on the protrusion domain of the HEV VLP were mutated, and expressed in insect cells to 
produce VLPs in the supernatatnt.
• Of the five engineered VLPs, N573C VLP was best suited for further modification, and it was conjugated to the 
breast cancer targeting ligand, LXY30.
Results
• The N573C VLP conjugated to LXY30 breast cancer targeting ligand and allowed to bind to breast cancer cell 
line MDA-MB-231, as well as cell-line-derived xenografts in mice. LXY30 VLP bound to a higher extent in cell 
line as well as in tumor tissue as compared with wild-type VLP.
Conclusion
• The HEV VLP can be engineered to be surface-modified without compromising the integrity of the particle.
• Further, engineering allows diverse functional groups to be displayed on the surface of the VLPs, which can 
then be used to target to various specialized cells and tissues, such as cancer cells.
• LXY30, a breast cancer targeting ligand, can be conjugated to the N573C HEV VLP to specifically target to 
breast cancer cells and in vivo in mice. This can be a powerful platform to develop theranostic nanoparticles 
for oral delivery and targeting to tumor tissues.
