IMPORTANCE The presumed proarrhythmic action of caffeine is controversial. Few studies
have assessed the effect of high doses of caffeine in patients with heart failure due to left
ventricular systolic dysfunction at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of high-dose caffeine or placebo on the frequency of
supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, both at rest and during a symptom-limited
exercise test.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Double-blinded randomized clinical trial with a
crossover design conducted at the heart failure and cardiac transplant clinic of a tertiary-care
university hospital. The trial included patients with chronic heart failure with
moderate-to-severe systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction <45%) and New
York Heart Association functional class I to III between March 5, 2013, and October 2, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Caffeine (100 mg) or lactose capsules, in addition to 5 doses of 100 mL
decaffeinated coffee at 1-hour intervals, for a total of 500 mg of caffeine or placebo during a
5-hour protocol. After a 1-week washout period, the protocol was repeated.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number and percentage of ventricular and supraventricular
premature beats assessed by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring.
RESULTS We enrolled 51 patients (37 [74%] male; mean [SD] age, 60.6 [10.9] years) with
predominantly moderate-to-severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (mean [SD] left
ventricular ejection fraction, 29% [7%]); 31 [61%] had an implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator device. No significant differences between the caffeine and placebo groups were
observed in the number of ventricular (185 vs 239 beats, respectively; P = .47) and
supraventricular premature beats (6 vs 6 beats, respectively; P = .44), as well as in couplets,
bigeminal cycles, or nonsustained tachycardia during continuous electrocardiographic
monitoring. Exercise test–derived variables, such as ventricular and supraventricular
premature beats, duration of exercise, estimated peak oxygen consumption, and heart rate,
were not influenced by caffeine ingestion. We observed no increases in ventricular premature
beats (91 vs 223 vs 207 beats, respectively) in patients with higher levels of plasma caffeine
concentration compared with lower plasma levels (P = .91) or with the placebo group
(P = .74).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Acute ingestion of high doses of caffeine did not induce
arrhythmias in patients with systolic heart failure and at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias.

T
he relationship between caffeine consumption and the
triggering of arrhythmias has been explored for de-
cades but remains controversial.1-3 Early experimental
studies indicated that caffeine appeared to cause severe ven-
tricular arrhythmias.4 Evidence from human studies, how-
ever, suggests that caffeine might not be arrhythmogenic in
most scenarios,5-8 except in extraordinary circumstances and
at very high doses.2,9,10 A recent systematic review and meta-
analysis of interventional studies in humans that assessed the
effectsofcaffeineconsumptiononventriculararrhythmiasper-
formed by our group did not demonstrate a significant asso-
ciation between caffeine consumption and ventricular pre-
mature beats (VPBs).11 Several studies that were incorporated
in this meta-analysis, however, were performed more than 3
decades ago, were not randomized, used single doses of caf-
feine, and had low methodological quality, limiting its appli-
cability in current practice.

The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of
high-dose caffeine intake or placebo on the rate of supraven-
tricular and ventricular ectopies at rest and during a symptom-
limited exercise test in a double-blinded randomized clinical
trial of patients with HF at high risk for ventricular arrhyth-
mias, using baseline standard-of-care therapy.

Patients
The study was performed from March 5, 2013, to October 2,
2015, and the participants were recruited from the heart fail-
ure and cardiac transplant clinic of a tertiary-care university
hospital in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Patients were eligible if they
had a previous diagnosis of HF, left ventricular ejection frac-
tion less than 45% assessed by 2-dimensional echocardiogra-
phy within 3 months of enrollment, and New York Heart As-
sociation (NYHA) functional class I to III. A prerequisite for
enrollment during the initial phase of the protocol (first 25 par-
ticipants) was the presence of an implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator (ICD), for safety purposes. As no clinically signifi-
cant events were observed, a research protocol addendum was
approved to include patients without an ICD. For those with
an ICD, it must have been implanted successfully and be nor-
mally functioning for at least 30 days. Exclusion criteria were
inabilitytoingestcaffeineorlactose(placebo),anymajorphysi-
cal limitation on performing a treadmill stress test, the use of
antiarrhythmic drugs (except for β-blockers and amiodarone
hydrochloride), an HF-related hospitalization within 2 months
of randomization, and documented episodes of unstable ven-
tricular arrhythmias (with shock or antitachycardia pacing)
within 2 months of randomization for those with an ICD.
Intervention and Protocol
Patients were instructed not to consume food and beverage
sources of caffeine during a 7-day washout period. After the
washout period, patients came to the hospital and remained
at the clinical research center during the 6 hours of the pro-
tocol. First, all participants answered a 15-item food fre-
quency questionnaire with major sources of caffeine and a 24-
hour recall record to verify washout adherence. Patients were
then monitored by continuous electrocardiographic (ECG)
monitoring (GE Mars 8000 analyzer, GE Seer Light recorder,
GE Medical Systems). Participants with an ICD were interro-
gated prior to enrollment and after the conclusion of the pro-
tocol. The ICDs had their monitoring zone programmed to de-
tect heart rates greater than 140 beats per minute prior to
initiation, and event analysis was performed by a blinded elec-
trophysiologist by the end of the protocol. After randomiza-
tion,participantsingested5dosesof100mLdecaffeinatedcof-
fee, mixed with 100 mg of either caffeine or lactose powder.
Doses were consumed at 1-hour intervals. Patients arrived at
8:00 AM at the research clinic; continuous ECG monitoring be-
gan at 9:00 AM simultaneously with the first coffee ingestion;
Key Points
Question Is there a proarrhythmic action of caffeine in patients
with heart failure?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the
short-term effects of high-dose caffeine in patients with heart
failure at increased risk for arrhythmic events. After 500 mg of
caffeine administered over a 5-hour period, we found no
statistically significant effect of caffeine ingestion on the
frequency of ventricular or supraventricular ectopies, even during
the physical stress of a treadmill test.
Meaning These results challenge the intuitive perception that
caffeine intake should be limited in patients with heart disease and
at risk for arrhythmia.

the last administration was at 1:00 PM; and the treadmill test
was performed at approximately 2:00 PM. The mean (SD) du-
ration of ECG monitoring was 6.7 (0.7) hours.
Blood samples were collected before and after the first
and last dose to measure levels of brain natriuretic peptide
(n = 25). At the end of each day, plasma was collected and
stored to measure plasma caffeine level. Caffeine plasma
concentration was measured by high-performance liquid
chromatography (using a Nexera XR Shimadzu system) as
previously described by Alvi and Hammami.15 One hour
after the last ingestion, patients underwent a treadmill test
(Naughton protocol) conducted by a trained and blinded
cardiologist. Our goal was to test the potential proarrhyth-
mic effect of caffeine use during exercise at the highest caf-
feine plasma concentration.16 Monitoring during exercise
recovery, a particularly vulnerable period for arrhythmias,
lasted a mean (SD) of 5.9 (0.4) minutes.
Arrhythmic Outcomes
The primary outcome was the number and percentage of VPBs
and supraventricular premature beats (SVPBs) measured by
continuous ECG monitoring during each phase of the proto-
col. Other outcomes of interest were episodes of nonsus-
tained ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia, appro-
priate or inappropriate ICD therapies, functional capacity, and
number of VPBs and SVPBs during the exercise treadmill test.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline clinical characteristics were expressed as mean with
SD or median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous vari-
ables, and absolute numbers and percentage for categorical
variables. Continuous variables were compared using the t test
for paired samples or Wilcoxon test as appropriate, whereas
categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test or Fisher
exacttest.Theprimaryoutcomewasalsoanalyzedusingagen-
eralizedestimatingequationmodel.A2-tailedP < .05wascon-
sidered statistically significant. Sample size (n = 49) was es-
timated considering a difference of 100 VPBs between groups
(considering a standard deviation of 414 and 350 VPBs and an
expected correlation of 0.8 between the 2 periods),6 with a sta-
tistical power of 80% and significance level of 5%. Statistical
analyses were performed using PASW Statistics for Windows,
version 18.0 (SPSS Inc).
Results
Between March 5, 2013, and October 2, 2015, a total of 137 pa-
tients with HF were assessed for eligibility. Up to October 31,
2014, only patients with HF with an ICD were screened for eli-
gibility. Major reasons for noninclusion are described in the
Figure; 2 patients discontinued participation before finishing
the second phase of the protocol because of nausea and head-
ache (both were receiving caffeine).

lar tachycardia episode (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95% CI, 0.31-
1.80) (Table 2), with no difference between the median num-
ber of episodes between groups. The same behavior was
observed for nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia:
7 and 9 participants recorded episodes on the caffeine and
placebo days of the protocol, respectively (OR, 0.69; 95% CI,
0.30-1.61). We also analyzed the percentage of VPBs and
SVPBs relative to the overall duration of continuous ECG
monitoring according to group allocation (Table 2). The
period in which patients were performing the treadmill test
was included in this analysis. No significant effect of caf-
feine administration was observed on these parameters.
Time analysis results showed no effect of sequence order of
crossover on our findings, confirming the effectiveness of
the randomization and washout procedures.
An additional analysis compared rates of arrhythmic end
points stratified by plasma caffeine concentrations (above
and below the median). We did not observe increased
arrhythmias in patients with higher plasma levels of caffeine
compared with lower levels or with the placebo group
(Table 3). Eight participants in the caffeine group with
higher plasma levels and 7 with lower plasma levels had at
least 1 nonsustained ventricular tachycardia episode (OR,
1.22; 95% CI, 0.35-4.25), while 4 and 3 participants recorded
episodes of nonsustained supraventricular tachycardia in
the higher and lower level of caffeine subgroups, respec-
tively (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.28-7.18).
Other subgroups of interest were also analyzed (habitual
coffee drinkers, use of amiodarone and digoxin, ischemic eti-
ology). No significant differences were observed for major ar-
rhythmic outcomes in this analysis (data not shown).
Treadmill Test Variables
Duringthetreadmilltest,therewerealsonodifferencesinVPBs
or SVPBs between both days of the protocol. Likewise, dura-
tion of exercise and estimated peak oxygen consumption were
similar between groups (Table 4). The only significant differ-
ences were higher values of peak systolic and diastolic blood
pressure in the caffeine group.
ICD Analysis
Analysis of arrhythmic events was conducted in the 31 en-
rolled patients that had an ICD. The final reading of ICD para-
meters was conducted after the last dose of caffeine or pla-
cebo, and no therapies (shocks or pacing) or other major
arrhythmic events were identified during each protocol. Sub-
group analysis stratified by patients with the ICD for primary
orforsecondaryprevention,orthosewithpreviousICDtherapy
did not demonstrate any effect of caffeine ingestion on ar-
rhythmic outcomes.
Discussion
Caffeine, a methylxanthine compound related to theophyl-
line, is the most widely consumed vasoactive substance in
the world.17 Its primary action is to stimulate the sympa-
thetic nervous system through different mechanisms, but
mainly by antagonizing adenosine receptors. Coffee is a
major source of caffeine, with varying amounts and concen-
trations of caffeine according to different types.18,19 The
presumed proarrhythmic action of caffeine has been the
focus of debate in recent years. In this double-blind ran-
domized crossover clinical trial, we evaluated the acute
effects of high-dose caffeine consumption in an HF popula-
tion at increased risk for arrhythmic events. After 500 mg of
caffeine administered over a 5-hour period, we found no
association between caffeine ingestion and arrhythmic epi-
sodes, even during the physical stress of a treadmill test. In
fact, we did not observe any indication of a potential
increased risk of ventricular or supraventricular premature
beats, couplets, or nonsustained tachycardia. Our results
challenge the intuitive notion that caffeine intake should be
limited or prohibited in patients with heart disease and at
risk for arrhythmia.
Early experimental studies and human case reports have
raised concerns about the risks associated with caffeine
ingestion. Ishida et al20 have shown that continuous

infusions of caffeine were associated with VPBs in rabbits,
while Mehta et al4 demonstrated a dose-response effect on
ventricular arrhythmias after a single dose of caffeine in
dogs. Meta-analysis from animal studies also suggests an
increased risk of developing ventricular fibrillation in ani-
mals that received very high doses (up to 35 mg/kg) of caf-
feine. In this scenario, blood caffeine concentrations seem to
influence the predisposition to arrhythmia in experimental
models.11 Furthermore, fatal ingestion of caffeine has been
described in at least 2 reports,10,21 reinforcing the potential
cause-and-effect relationship between this substance and
presumably severe and complex arrhythmias.
Human intervention studies that assessed the arrhyth-
mogenic actions of caffeine have been conducted in differ-
ent populations, mostly between 1980 and 1990. Most
reports failed to suggest a caffeine-related increase in
arrhythmic risk.7,8 Myers et al22 tested 300 mg of caffeine
against placebo in patients with a previous myocardial
infarction. Although they observed a 26% increased risk of
VPBs, this finding was not statistically significant. They
demonstrated that neither the frequency nor the severity of
ventricular arrhythmias was increased with caffeine. In
1996, Newby et al23 tested whether caffeine restriction in
patients with frequent VPBs could reduce symptomatic pal-
pitations; after 6 weeks of intervention, there were no sig-
nificant changes in palpitation scores or VPB frequency. In
an attempt to find a more robust answer to this question, we
recently conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis
of experimental and intervention studies of caffeine in both
healthy and unhealthy individuals.11 Our findings suggest
that there is no significant effect of caffeine consumption
on VBPs in human interventional studies. The positive asso-
ciations observed and meta-analyzed in 2 animal studies
were probably the result of very high caffeine doses that are
not regularly consumed by humans. Nevertheless, we
observed that most reports included in this systematic

review had poor methodological quality in both animal and
human protocols. Internationally accepted quality para-
meters of the included studies were consistently faulty,
with omission of important information regarding protocol
description, allocation of interventions, and baseline clini-
cal characteristics of research participants.
Reports evaluating caffeine ingestion in patients with HF
are also scarce. Mostofsky et al24 performed a dose-response
meta-analysis of prospective studies and suggested that
moderate coffee consumption (4 cups/d) could even be pro-
tective against HF development. In patients with established
HF, a protocol of intravenous infusion of 4 mg/kg (roughly
equivalent to 2 cups of coffee) led to an increase in mean
exercise duration of 10% (P = .004) in 10 stable patients with
HF, without any evidence of arrhythmias.25 Our results are in
agreement with these findings. Despite the speculation that
caffeine might be a possible trigger for arrhythmias during
exercise, our study showed no difference in VPBs and SVPBs
during a symptom-limited treadmill protocol. Although we
did not observe an improvement in exercise performance, it
has been suggested that caffeine in doses from 4 to 9 mg/kg
can also induce analgesia, reduce fatigue sensations, and
improve neuromuscular function, all of which could prolong
time to fatigue during muscular exercise.26,27 The effect of
caffeine also leads to a temporary blood pressure increase,
which does not result in long-term hypertension.28 In our
study, this acute and expected increase in blood pressure was
observed during the Naughton protocol on the caffeine day.
Although we used high doses of caffeine, the final net effect
on heart rate was neutral during the exercise protocol. This
could be attributed to the interaction of elevated plasma caf-
feine levels in a background of 98% use of β-blockade.
Notarius et al25 have reported similar results previously,
observing no effect of caffeine infusion on the resting and
peak exercise heart rate in patients with HF, but significant
changes in healthy individuals.
Our protocol and study design have several unique char-
acteristics. We initially recruited patients with HF with an ICD
device for 2 reasons: first, to guarantee that patients would not
be exposed to the risk of potentially life-threatening events
without an adequate protective device, and second, to en-
sure that the studied sample would represent a group of pa-
tients at moderate to high risk for major ventricular arrhyth-
mias. Stratified analysis based on plasma caffeine levels also
added important information, as absorption of caffeine in-
gested orally might be variable depending on individual
metabolism.29 Concentrations observed in our study are in
agreement with the few previous reports that describe caf-
feine plasma levels,22,30 and reinforce that even in those with
high blood concentrations (above the median), arrhythmias
were not induced. Finally, patients evaluated in the present

raryHFcohortsandthatourresultscouldbeapplicableinmost
clinical scenarios.
Limitations
Some limitations of the present analysis deserve consider-
ation. Our results demonstrate no effect of acute (1-day) use
of caffeine on ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias.
Also, some of our patients (approximately 50%) were
habitual coffee drinkers and this may potentially exert an
influence on our results, as routine consumers might be less
prone to the modulatory effects of the substance. Although

we believe this to be unlikely, we cannot ensure that long-
term and high-dose use of caffeine is not associated with a
proarrhythmic effect in patients with HF. In this sense, our
findings should be interpreted with caution because of the
small number of patients included and the relatively low
prevalence of arrhythmias that was observed. We also
acknowledge that our subgroup analyses are underpowered
for definitive conclusions.

More Evidence That Caffeine Consumption Appears
to Be Safe in Patients With Heart Failure
Jacob P. Kelly, MD; Christopher B. Granger, MD
Caffeine is a biologically active compound with stimulant and
diuretic effects that is ingested throughout the world. Coffee is
the primary source of caffeine, with 40 to 220 mg per cup of
brewed coffee (vs 20-110 mg
per cup of tea). The interest in
caffeine’
seffectsoncardiovas-
cular disease stems from its
popularity in everyday consumption (more than half of Ameri-
cansdrinkcoffeedaily)combinedwithitsknownactionsasacen-
tralnervoussystemstimulantthatmayincreasebloodpressure.
Thus,thereisconcernthatitcouldincreaseriskofcoronaryheart
disease events and of arrhythmias.
However, in aggregate, the multiple studies and meta-
analyses show either neutral1 or protective effects2 of caf-
feine ingestion on cardiovascular risk. While acute ingestion
may increase blood pressure,3 population studies show no as-
sociation of caffeine intake with chronic hypertension. Obser-
vational studies have led to the conclusion that daily coffee
consumption may reduce the development of diabetes melli-
tus and depression, with modest increases in triglyceride and
plasma cholesterol levels and with possible beneficial effects
on cardiovascular outcomes related to coronary heart dis-
ease, heart failure, and stroke.1,2,4
Withregardtoarrhythmias,populationstudieshavefound
caffeine ingestion to be associated with risk of neither atrial
fibrillation nor ventricular ectopy.5,6 An analysis of the Car-
diovascular Health Study reported on 1388 Cardiovascular
Health Study participants who had completed food consump-
tion surveys and ambulatory Holter monitoring. Of the 61%
who consumed 1 or more caffeinated products per day, the me-
dian numbers of premature atrial and ventricular premature
contractions per hour were 3 (interquartile range, 1-12) and 1
(interquartile range, 0-7), respectively, with no association of
caffeine consumption and ectopy.5
One challenge with the literature is its dependence mainly
on observational studies, which are almost certainly con-
founded such that we should not be overly reassured by the
findings. In particular, healthy user bias could lead to falsely
concluding that coffee consumption is safe.
Specific to patients with heart failure, caffeine consump-
tion has been reported to lead to unchanged peak oxygen con-
sumption but an increase in peak minute ventilation and ex-
ercise duration.7 In addition to caffeine, coffee contains
hundreds of other compounds. The National Institutes of
Health–AARP Diet and Health Study evaluated more than
400 000 men and women with coffee consumption assessed
atbaseline,findinganinverserelationshipforcoffeeconsump-
tionandthedevelopmentofheartfailure,withanadjustedhaz-
ard ratio of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93) for total and cause-
specific mortality in those who consumed 4 to 5 cups daily.8
Similarly, a systematic review including a dose-response meta-
analysis of prospective studies that assessed the relationship
of habitual coffee consumption and the risk of heart failure in-
cluding 6522 heart failure events and 140 220 participants re-
vealed a J-shaped relationship between coffee consumption
and heart failure, with the strongest inverse association seen
for 4 servings per day of coffee consumption.9 The associa-
tion is not strong evidence for cause and effect because there
likely is substantial unmeasured confounding.
Patients with heart failure are at substantially increased
risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and of sudden death;
thus, the issue of arrhythmias with caffeine consumption in
this population is important.
In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Zuchinali et al10
examined the effects of 500 mg of caffeine consumed at a rate
of 100 mg each hour for 5 hours on atrial and ventricular ar-
rhythmias in 51 participants with recent hospitalizations for
heartfailurewithreducedleftventricularejectionfractionwho
were able to perform treadmill stress tests. The trial used a ran-
domized double-blind crossover design. The primary out-
come was ventricular premature beats and supraventricular
premature beats measured by continuous electrocardio-
graphicmonitoringoverthe6hoursofthestudyincludingdur-
ingstresstesting.Themeanageoftheparticipantswas61years,
two-thirds were nonischemic in heart failure etiology, mean
left ventricular ejection fraction was 29%, and nearly all were
treated with a β-blocker and inhibitor of the angiotensin sys-
tem. There was no significant difference in ventricular or su-
praventricular premature beats between groups, with 185 and
239 ventricular premature beats in the caffeine and placebo
groups, respectively (P = .47), and 16 and 19 episodes of non-
sustainedventriculartachycardia,respectively(P = .48).There
were only 7 and 9 episodes of nonsustained supraventricular
tachycardia in the caffeine and placebo groups, respectively.
Similarly, there were no differences in peak oxygen consump-
tion and there were significantly higher peak systolic and dia-
stolic blood pressures in the caffeine group.
This rigorous randomized clinical trial is a welcome addi-
tion to the literature. However, there are limitations to the
study, mainly around the short-term nature of the exposure
