Economic costs of osteoarthritis (OA) are considerable. However, there are no clinical tools to predict 
the progression of OA or guide patients to a correct treatment for preventing OA. We tested the ability 
of our cartilage degeneration algorithm to predict the subject-specific development of OA and separate 
groups with different OA levels. The algorithm was able to predict OA progression similarly with the 
experimental follow-up data and separate subjects with radiographical OA (Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) 
grade 2 and 3) from healthy subjects (KL0). Maximum degeneration and degenerated volumes within 
cartilage were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in OA compared to healthy subjects, KL3 group showing 
the highest degeneration values. Presented algorithm shows a great potential to predict subject-
specific progression of knee OA and has a clinical potential by simulating the effect of interventions 
on the progression of OA, thus helping decision making in an attempt to delay or prevent further OA 
symptoms.
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease causing pain and limitations in joint movement. At tissue level, 
OA affects predominantly articular cartilage, although other tissues, such as bone, meniscus, and synovium, are 
also involved. Indirectly, this may lead to social isolation, decrease in work ability, depression, i.e., decrease in the 
general quality of life1. Currently in Europe, it has been approximated that nearly 5–15% of people aged 35–74 
years have knee OA2. Increasing health issues due to knee OA lead to severe economic burden in societies. For 
instance, it has been estimated that the total costs of arthritis (including direct and indirect costs) are approxi-
mately 2.5% of the gross domestic product in the US3, which corresponds to more than USD $400 billion. Despite 
a large research effort worldwide, there is no cure for OA, and consequently, the best and most cost-effective 
treatment option at the moment would be prevention. However, there are no methods which would quantitatively 
predict subject-specific progression of OA. This would be necessary when planning the most suitable preventative 
and personalized interventions for OA treatment.
Obesity is one of the major risk factors for OA4, 5 and ~50% of OA can be attributed to overweight and obe-
sity6. It has been shown that subjects with BMI over 30 kg/m2 have 6.8 times higher chance to develop knee OA 
compared to normal weight subjects7. The knee joint of an obese person experiences substantial mechanical 
loads that can lead to OA and degenerative changes in the composition, structure and mechanical properties of 
articular cartilage8, 9. However, at the individual level, it is currently not possible to predict whether mechanical 
overweight-induced overloading leads to the onset and progression of knee OA, and if it does, to what extent.

The diagnosis of OA is usually based on the clinical examination and conventional radiography. However, 
this traditional diagnostic approach is insensitive to the early stages of OA10, since radiography does not reveal 
early degenerative tissue changes in cartilage tissue and potential OA subjects may not feel pain in their knees. 
The Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grading11 is the most commonly used X-ray based grading criteria for assessing 
the severity and progression of knee OA12 and making treatment decisions. KL grading focuses on joint space 
narrowing and osteophyte development, and therefore, it cannot directly assess changes in cartilage structure 
and composition. On the other hand, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive method to image 
soft tissues. Compared to X-ray or even computed tomography (CT), MRI is capable of detecting and measuring 
changes in articular cartilage morphology and composition in 3D13–15. However, MRI information gives only 
imaging insight of the current knee joint condition, but it does not provide any information of the future status 
of the knee.
Mechanical stress plays a significant role in OA pathogenesis16. Computational mechanical models have been 
successfully used for analyzing changes in cartilage and menisci contact mechanics17–21, and describing how they 
relate to the onset and progression of OA22–24. In addition to contact mechanics analyses, computational models 
have been investigated to study soft tissue adaptation such as collagen remodelling in different soft tissues25–28, 
cartilage growth29–31 and damage32, 33.
Even though computational modelling has been widely used for investigating knee joint function, car-
tilage stress levels, and soft tissue adaptation and growth, there is lack of quantitative methods for predicting 
subject-specific progression of knee OA. Recently, we developed a novel cartilage degeneration algorithm based 
on tissue overloading to predict the progression of OA34. In that study, only a general behaviour of OA progres-
sion of two subject groups (normal weight and obese) was tested with the algorithm in a population-based man-
ner. No information was provided on the ability of the algorithm for personalized prediction of the progression 
of knee OA or to separate groups with different levels of OA. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to inves-
tigate the ability of the algorithm to separate clinically healthy but obese subjects, diagnosed from the baseline 
radiographs, into different KL grade groups based on the predicted level of cartilage degeneration. Subsequently, 
prediction results are compared to clinical radiography (KL grade) and MRI findings of the cartilage tissue degen-
eration at the 4-year follow-up.
Results
Osteoarthritis Initiative Subjects. 
Total of 21 subjects with radiographically intact knee joint 
(KL-grade = 0) at the baseline were selected from the Osteoarthritis Initiative Database (OAI–http://www.
oai.ucsf.edu/) (Fig. 1). All subjects were less than 65 years old and they had not had meniscus or knee injuries 
(never operated meniscus or cartilage, never injured badly enough to limit the ability to walk for at least two 
days) (see exact inclusion criteria from Fig. 1). Subjects were divided into three different groups: KL0, KL2, and 
KL3, based on the 4-year follow-up KL-grades (Fig. 1). In KL0 group (N = 7, BMI = 23.1 ± 1.6 kg/m2), KL-grade 
remained unchanged after 4-year follow-up, while in KL2 (N = 7, BMI = 33.0 ± 2.2 kg/m2) and KL3 (N = 7, 
BMI = 33.7 ± 3.7 kg/m2) groups KL-grade increased from 0 to 2 or 3, respectively, during the follow-up period. 
Note that KL0 group represent normal weight subjects, while KL2 and KL3 represent overweight subjects. There 
was no statistical difference in BMI between the two latter groups (p > 0.05) even though their OA grade was 
different.
Cartilage degeneration algorithm. 
Cartilage degenerations were simulated for three different KL grade 
groups (KL0, KL2 and KL3) using the cartilage degeneration algorithm (see more from Methods)34. Predicted 
(computed) degeneration levels were compared to cartilage degenerations obtained from 4-years follow-up radi-
ographic KL grading and MRI scoring using simplified MOAKS grading (described in Methods section). Since 
MOAKS grading showed that most of the cartilage degeneration occurs on the medial side of the knee, only 
medial compartment models were used for investigating cartilage degeneration. Workflow for degenerative sim-
ulations can be divided into three steps. First, subject-specific whole knee joint geometries were constructed 
from the 3D DESS MRI data based on the baseline visit (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, segmented geometries and gait 
cycle loading34, scaled to match to the subject’s body weight, were implemented into the finite element models. 
Finally, medial compartment models were constructed based on whole knee joint model simulations (Fig. 2B) 
and the collagen fibril degeneration algorithm was implemented into the models (see details in Methods section) 
(Fig. 2C). Predicted degenerations and MOAKS gradings from the central part of the medial tibial cartilage from 
five KL3 and KL0 subjects are shown in Fig. 3. In KL3 group, peak degenerations within cartilage were consid-
erably higher and degenerated areas were larger compared to KL0 group. The same finding was verified with 
MOAKS grades in the medial compartment, i.e. MOAKS grades and cartilage degenerations in KL3 group were 
higher compared to those in KL0 group.
Prediction of cartilage degeneration levels. 
Maximum degeneration in medial femoral cartilage was 
significantly (p < 0.05) higher in KL2 and KL3 groups compared to KL0 group during all 100 iterations (Fig. 4). 
On the other hand, in medial tibial cartilage, maximum degeneration during all iterations was significantly 
(p < 0.05) higher in KL3 group compared to KL0 group, but differences between KL2 group compared to KL0 
group were significant (p < 0.05) only during first 65 iterations (Fig. 4). The average of maximum degeneration 
in medial femoral cartilage after 100 iterations was ~two and ~four times higher in KL2 and KL3 groups, respec-
tively, compared to KL0 group (p < 0.05, Fig. 5A). The difference in maximum degeneration in medial femoral 
cartilage between KL3 and KL2 groups was not statistically significant (p > 0.05), though the average of maximum 
degeneration was 45% higher in KL3 group. In medial tibial cartilage, statistically insignificant (p > 0.05) one time 
and significant (p < 0.05) two times higher maximum degenerations were seen between KL0 and KL2 groups,

and between KL0 and KL3 groups, respectively (Fig. 5A). The average of maximum degeneration in medial tibial 
cartilage was 37% higher in KL3 than KL2 group, but this difference was not significant (p > 0.05).
The mean volumes of degenerated elements after 100 iterations in medial femoral cartilage were ~seven and 
~nine times higher in KL2 and KL3 groups, respectively, compared to KL0 group (p < 0.05, Fig. 5B). Moreover, 
mean degenerated volumes were on average 16% higher in KL3 group compared to KL2 group, but the difference 
was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Correspondingly, in medial tibial cartilage, ~four and ~eight times 
higher degenerated volumes were observed in KL2 and KL3 groups compared to KL0 group (p < 0.05). A differ-
ence of 68% between KL2 and KL3 groups was observed, but it was not significant (p > 0.05) (Fig. 5B).
Receiving Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis confirmed that both the maximum degeneration and 
volume of degenerated elements after 100 iterations were significantly (p < 0.05) different between KL0 and KL3 
group subjects as well as between KL0 and KL2 group subjects, except for the maximum degeneration in tibial

30 and who fulfilled all other inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria are for knee joints used in FE modelling (3 left 
and 18 right), but in addition initial KL for non-modelled knee joint had to be 0 or 1.

justification behind that from Results section). Outcome force and rotations from the whole knee joint model

compartment models to predict the level cartilage degeneration in three different KL groups (KL0, KL2 and

failure limit34, decreasing collagen fibril network stiffness (See more details in Method section).

cartilage between KL0 and KL2 groups (Fig. 6). The highest Area Under Curve (AUC) value was always obtained 
between KL0 and KL3 groups.
Matrices of classification errors (Table 1), calculated from the values after 100 iterations, showed that the level 
of OA was predicted adequately for KL0 and KL3 group subjects when the cut-off values were selected from the 
ROC curves such that the Youden index was maximized. Maximum degeneration of tibial cartilage predicted 
adequately also the level of OA for KL2 group subjects. On the other hand, the most confusion occurred in the 
prediction of the level of OA for KL2 group subjects when the maximum degeneration of femoral cartilage and 
volume of degenerated elements were studied.

Discussion
Using quantitative cartilage degeneration algorithm, we were able to separate subjects with different levels of 
radiographical OA (KL2 and KL3 groups) from healthy subjects (KL0 group) after the 4-year follow-up period. 
It should be highlighted that the algorithm was even able to show higher degeneration levels for KL3 than KL2 
group, even though these groups had the same BMI. These results highlight the potential of our degeneration 
algorithm to predict the subject-specific overloading-related progression of the knee OA.
The analysis of degenerated volumes within articular cartilage was able to separate both KL2 and KL3 subjects 
from KL0 subjects (Figs 5 and 6). Maximum degeneration parameter was also able to separate successfully KL2 
and KL3 subjects from KL0 subjects in the femoral cartilage, but in the tibial cartilage, only KL3 subjects were 
separated statistically from KL0 group. These results suggest that the degenerated volume is likely more relevant 
predictive parameter since in more severe OA larger area of degenerated cartilage can be seen in the knee joint 
as verified in our subjects by MOAKS grading. In terms of KL grade, local cartilage defects in relative small areas 
do not necessarily show any degenerative changes in radiographic evaluation35. Therefore, local cartilage degen-
erations may be as severe even though the radiographic degree of OA (KL2 or KL3 group) would be different.
In the analysis of confusion matrix (Table 1), cut-off points were selected so that the Youden index was max-
imized36, 37. Using that selection, the levels of OA were predicted fairly well for KL0 and KL3 groups. Most of

confusion was observed in the prediction of the level of OA for KL2 group subjects in all the other parameters 
except in the predicted maximum degeneration of tibial cartilage. Changing the cut-off point could improve our 
predictions also for the KL2 group. On the other hand, increasing the subject number could improve the ROC 
curves leading to improvements in our predictions as well.
Radiographic KL grading is the most commonly used OA classification method in clinics and OAI database 
provides this information for almost all subjects (other grades such as MOAKS are provided only for small subset 
of the subjects). For that reason, subjects were divided into different OA groups based on radiographic KL classi-
fication11, 38 after 4-year follow-up. This can also be considered as a limitation of the study since previous studies 
have shown that KL grades may vary between different observers11, 39. On the other hand, a significant correlation 
in KL grades between observers was seen earlier11 and reproducibility of the KL classification method was shown 
to be good when subjects with KL ≥
 2 were studied39.
KL grading method estimates the degree of OA mainly based on the amount of osteophytes and joint space 
narrowing and cannot reveal any changes in cartilage. Our degeneration algorithm predicts directly cartilage 
degeneration, not bony changes or cartilage loss. Cartilage thinning was indirectly taken into account in our

algorithm as cartilage became softer due to OA progression, which actually leads to joint space narrowing dur-
ing joint loading. On the other hand, when comparing our simulation results to tibial cartilage changes in MRI 
(MOAKS scoring performed by the musculoskeletal radiologist), our method predicted reasonable well actual 
degeneration locations in central regions of medial tibial cartilage (Fig. 3). In femoral cartilage, based on the 
MOAKS scores, cartilage degenerations occurred primarily on the anterior part of femoral cartilage, i.e., on the 
patellofemoral contact region. Since our model did not take this contact into account, MOAKS comparison of 
femoral cartilage was not relevant.
In the current study the stress threshold inducing cartilage degeneration was fixed (7 MPa) while it could be 
different for different subjects and it may vary during the progression of OA. Smaller threshold value in more 
degenerated cartilage would likely increase the area and volume of degenerated elements in the model and even 
improve the prediction of cartilage degeneration.
First signs of OA in cartilage tissue are collagen fibrillation, proteoglycan loss and increase in water content40. 
Since collagen controls strongly the mechanical response of cartilage under dynamic loading41, 42, such as walking 
which was simulated, and collagen network damage due to overloading can initiate OA43, 44, only collagen fibrilla-
tion was considered in our algorithm by decreasing the collagen network stiffness, while other factors (proteogly-
can loss, water content) were not taken into account here. Those factors should be considered in the degeneration 
algorithm in the future to test if they would even improve the predictive value of the current algorithm. However, 
in order to validate such an improvement in the algorithm to separate degenerative changes in different tissue

constituents, quantitative follow-up information (e.g some specific MRI parameters45) of specific changes in pro-
teoglycan and water content during the progression of OA would be needed.
The subject-specific knee joint geometries were obtained from MRI, meaning that anatomical factors (shape 
and knee alignment) were taken into account in our degeneration model. On the other hand, knee loading was 
taken from the literature, since there was no subject-specific gait data in the OAI database. The individual gait 
data could improve the accuracy of our method and transfer degeneration locations even closer to actual changes 
observed in 4-year follow-up MRI (Fig. 3). Unlike MRI of the knee joint, nowadays in clinical practice collecting 
subject-specific gait data is not usually feasible, since measurements and data analysis are time consuming and 
gait analysis may not provide sufficient information for treatment planning. Therefore, it is encouraging that even 
without this data our predictions matched well with the radiographic and MRI evaluations, especially in the tibial 
cartilage.
Due to simplicity and initial estimation of the time needed for model generation and computations, quadri-
ceps forces, patella, ligaments and muscles were neglected from the model. However, effects of patella as well 
as effects of muscles and ligaments were considered in external load in terms of total knee joint reaction forces 
between the tibiofemoral joint. This load input was also the same as used before34. It is known that knee OA can be 
seen also in patellofemoral joint, and thus, in such an analysis patella should be included in the model. However, 
it is also commonly known that OA develops primarily in the medial compartment35, 46 as was verified by our sub-
jects’ MOAKS scores. Therefore, the analysis of only medial compartments was considered feasible in this study.
The total number of subjects used in this study was 21 divided into three different KL groups. This number is 
small but sufficient for statistical comparison. To our knowledge, this is the first whole knee joint FE modelling 
study, where the subject number is this large. In most of the previous knee joint finite element studies, the subject 
number was restricted to one or two47–49. On the other hand, since our inclusion criteria were tight, there were 
only 7 suitable subjects for KL3 group in OAI database. We wanted to keep our number of subjects in each group 
the same, thus in order to increase the subject number we should have loosened our inclusion criteria and include 
subjects whose OA may have been initiated due to other factors than overweight (for instance injury or surgery). 
However, in this study we wanted to keep groups homogeneous for a fair comparison. Furthermore, manual seg-
mentation as well as creation and simulation of FE models for 21 subjects are time consuming, since there does 
not exist automatic phases during model generation. Naturally, higher subject number might statistically even 
improve our predictions for OA development and separate better KL2 from KL3 grade group. On the other hand, 
there were already statistically significant differences between healthy (KL0) and OA (KL2 and KL3) groups with 
the used subject number. Nonetheless, before the current method can be used as a clinical application in person-
alized healthcare, it should be tested and validated with higher subject number and with different subject groups.
Our degeneration algorithm is based on excessive and cumulative loads due to overweight, since it has been 
suggested in earlier studies that those are the risk factors for the onset and progression of OA16 and obesity is one 
of the major risk factors for knee OA50. On the other hand, it is known that there exist also other risk factors than 
load, such as gender51, 52, aging51, physical activity level53, 54 and metabolic changes (e.g. inflammation)55, 56. In 
the future, some of those factors could be taken into account in the degeneration algorithm. One option would 
be to adjust the threshold level for degeneration based on different risk factors. For instance, a previous study 
shows that cartilage failure limit is highly dependent on age of the subject57. Failure limit increases from ~25 to 
~40 MPa until the age of 20–30 years and after that it starts to decrease to <10 MPa. On the other hand, estima-
tion of subject-specific metabolic changes during the follow-up period is challenging, but if those could be reliable 
estimated and implemented into the algorithm, prediction of OA progression could be improved. However, first 
we would need to have solid statistical evidence how these parameters would affect KL or MOAKS gradings. It 
should be also noted that even the presented algorithm, purely based on mechanical overloading, was able to 
statistically separate healthy subjects from those with OA. It was also able to give higher degenerative levels for

KL3 subjects than for KL2 subjects. Thus, at this point it is not possible to evaluate whether those additions to the 
algorithm would improve the prediction or not.
Since our goal was to predict local cartilage degeneration due to biomechanical overloading of the joint, a FE 
based method was applied. Therefore, data-driven methods were not used. One way to use the data-driven meth-
ods with our FE model and algorithm would be to add biomechanical factors into the statistical or machine learn-
ing based predictive models. However, in practice this would necessitate FE analysis of hundreds of subjects which 
would take years just to create those kinds of biomechanical models. In addition, statistical or machine learning 
methods would approach a template-based analysis, meaning that there would be lack of subject-specificity in 
terms of knee geometry and mechanics. This would then change the purpose of our current study.
It is estimated that annual costs per patient are increasing as Kellgren-Lawrence grade is increasing58 and costs 
for end-stage OA (prior to hip or knee replacement) are average of $3800 per person59. It is also suggested that the 
amount of total knee replacements will increase more than 600% by 2030 resulting in ~3.5 million operations in 
the US60. Our degeneration algorithm was able to predict cartilage degeneration for obese subjects and separate 
groups with different levels of OA. Thus, it provides a novel tool to predict quantitatively the subject-specific levels 
of cartilage degenerations and estimate progression of OA. By using this approach, effects of different interven-
tions, such as weight loss, rehabilitation, and surgery, on OA progression could be simulated in a personalized 
medicine manner. Therefore, this algorithm could be applied as a clinical tool to improve personalized OA treat-
ment planning by “optimizing” the intervention. This could decelerate or prevent the progression of OA and delay 
the need for total knee replacement surgery. Thus, it could help in economical savings for societies and obtain 
better quality of life, especially for elderly.
Methods
Osteoarthritis Initiative subjects. 
OAI datasets AllClinical00 and AllClinical06 were used for BMI, age, 
health status of menisci, and previous knee injuries. Datasets 0.C.2 and 0.E.1 were used for baseline MRI and 
6.C.1 and 6.E.1 for 4-year follow-up MRI, whereas kxr_sq_bu00 and kxr_sq_bu06 were used for baseline and 
follow-up Kellgren-Lawrence grades, respectively. Ethical approval for collecting all subject information was pro-
vided by the OAI. Knee MRI’s were carried out in accordance with FDA guidelines, whereas knee radiographs 
(x-ray) were carried out in accordance with typical guidelines for annual and total radiation dosage to research 
subjects. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to each clinic visit. The committee on human 
research is the institutional review board for the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and its affiliates. 
Since data collection was performed in many places, possible changes in OAI study protocol were reviewed and 
approved by local institutional review boards. Further details related to the OAI data are available in the OAI 
web-site (http://www.oai.ucsf.edu/).
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) –grading. 
The MR images 
were obtained with clinical 3 T MRI device (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a dual-echo steady-state imag-
ing sequence (SAG 3D DESS, TR = 16.32 ms, TE = 4.71 ms, flip angle = 25°, voxel size = 0.36 ×
 0.36 ×
 0.7 mm). 
The severity of structural changes was graded using a simplified MRI OA Knee Score (MOAKS) in separate knee 
locations61. In this study, we were focusing only on changes in articular cartilage and especially in tibiofemoral 
contact region, which is a part in the original MOAKS grading system. In MOAKS, we analyzed sizes of articular 
cartilage losses such that 0: no cartilage loss, 1: cartilage loss is < 10%, 2: cartilage loss is 10–75%, and 3: cartilage 
loss is > 75% of region of cartilage surface area. Femoral and tibial cartilages were divided into three different 
regions (anterior, central and posterior), but in femoral cartilage only central region being in contact with tibial 
cartilage during walking was analyzed. This is justified by the applied joint motion (joint forces concentrated 
mainly in central region in femoral cartilage) and our method does not require information about the forces in 
patellofemoral contact region. A musculoskeletal radiologist performed the MOAKS grading and he was unaware 
of subject’s characteristics, clinical and radiographic data.
Geometry creation and finite element (FE) models. 
Knee joint geometries and finite element models 
were generated similarly as in a previous study34. MRI sequence used for segmentation was the same as described 
in MOAKS grading section. Tibial and femoral cartilages and menisci were segmented manually from the MR 
images using Matlab v7.14 (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) (Fig. 2A). 3D knee joint geometries were cre-
ated using Mimics v15.01 (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium) and final geometries were imported to Abaqus mod-
elling software (Abaqus v6.13-3, Dassault Systèmes, Providence, RI, USA), where finite element models were 
constructed.
Cartilages were meshed using first-order, 8-node porous continuum hexahedral elements (element 
type = C3D8P) and first-order, 8-node continuum hexahedral elements without porosity (element type = C3D8) 
were used for meshing menisci. Element sizes in the whole knee joint model were ~1.5 mm, ~0.7 mm and ~1 mm 
for femoral and tibial cartilage and menisci, respectively. To investigate cartilage degeneration, medial compart-
ment models were created (Fig. 2B). In those models, element sizes were ~1 mm and ~0.5 mm in femoral and 
tibial cartilage, respectively.
Fibril-reinforced poroviscoelastic (FRPVE) material was implemented for cartilages and transversely isotropic 
elastic (TI) material for menisci (Table 2). In the FRPVE material model, cartilage is composed of nonfibrillar 
and fibrillar matrices, in which the nonfibrillar part describes proteoglycans and interstitial fluid and the fibrillar 
part describes collagens. The fibrillar matrix consists of well-oriented primary and randomly-oriented secondary 
collagen fibrils62. The total stress σ
tot is the sum of the solid nonfibrillar matrix stress σ
nf, fibrillar matrix stress 
(sum of primary and secondary fibril stresses) σ

where I is the unit tensor. Detailed description of the FRPVE material and implementation of the FRPVE and TI 
materials into the FE models can be seen from previous studies34, 62.
Since OAI database does not have subject-specific gait data, generic gait cycle from previous experimental 
studies63, 64 was implemented into the FE models, similarly as in a previous study34 (Fig. 2A). Gait cycle was imple-
mented by three separate steps as follows: 1) Prior to the gait load, cartilages were first brought into a light contact; 
2) Subsequently, initial axial load and flexion angle from the experiments were implemented into the model; 3) 
Finally, entire gait cycle was implemented and it was controlled by using time-dependent motion data (scaled to 
the subject’s body weight). Total duration of the stance phase of gait was 0.8 s. More detailed description of load 
implementation, boundary conditions and contact definitions can be seen from a previous study34.
The medial compartment models without menisci for the degeneration simulations was created34 to improve 
the computational efficiency and convergence (Fig. 2B). Time-dependent supportive effect of medial menisci was 
calculated and reduced from axial load extracted from the simulations of the whole knee joint model. In addition, 
flexion-extension angle and varus-valgus rotation were extracted from the whole knee joint models and extracted 
tibio-femoral loads and rotations were implemented into the medial compartment models (Fig. 2B). Finally, the 
iterative cartilage degeneration algorithm was included and the computational models were simulated using 100 
iterative degenerative steps to get simulation results in a reasonable time (Fig. 2C).
Cartilage degeneration algorithm. 
Since excessive loading and accumulated loads have been suggested 
to cause mechanical failure in cartilage16, our degeneration algorithm was based not only on impact loading 
but also duration of the load in different regions of the cartilage during walking. Only collagen was allowed to 
degrade in the algorithm, since collagen fibrillation is one of the first signs of OA reducing collagen matrix stiff-
ness and controlling mechanical response of the cartilage during dynamic loads such as walking40–42. In the algo-
rithm, local collagen fibril degeneration occurs if tensile stress of 7 MPa (cartilage failure limit34, 65) is exceeded 
at any time point during walking34. Fibril degeneration was controlled iteratively by reducing the collagen fibril 
network stiffness of the FRPVE material.
Cartilage fibril degeneration algorithm worked as follows: The current level of collagen fibril degeneration Di 
in each element was considered as a weighted mean after each i:th iteration (gait cycle) so that

ation as a function of time. Fibril degeneration was assumed to occur if a collagen failure threshold T (7 MPa) is 
exceeded. Factor Dt was calculated as follows:

Statistical analysis. 
Mann-Whitney U-test was used for statistical comparison between different KL-groups 
in volumes of degenerated elements and maximum degeneration levels of the medial tibial and femoral carti-
lages. Predictive accuracy of the algorithm was tested using Receiving Operating Characteristics (ROC) and 
Area Under Curve (AUC)66. In addition, matrices of classification errors were calculated using the Youden index 
criteria for cut-off values, i.e. the vertical distance from the reference line to the cut-off point was maximized36, 37. 
The level of significance was set to p < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (SPSS 23.0, 
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
