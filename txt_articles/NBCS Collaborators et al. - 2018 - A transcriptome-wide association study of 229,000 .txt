Abstract: 
349 
Breast cancer risk variants identified in genome-wide association studies explain only a small 
350 
fraction of familial relative risk, and genes responsible for these associations remain largely 
351 
unknown. To identify novel risk loci and likely causal genes, we performed a transcriptome-wide 
352 
association study evaluating associations of genetically predicted gene expression with breast 
353 
cancer risk in 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European ancestry. We used data from 67 
354 
subjects included in the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project to establish genetic models to 
355 
predict gene expression in breast tissue and evaluated model performance using data from 86 
356 
subjects included in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Of the 8,597 genes evaluated, significant 
357 
associations were identified for 48 at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P < 5.82×10-6, 
358 
including 14 genes at loci not yet reported for breast cancer risk. We silenced 13 genes and 
359 
showed an effect for 11 on cell proliferation and/or colony forming efficiency. Our study 
360 
provides new insights into breast cancer genetics and biology.  
361 
 
 
362 
 Wu et al. – Page 10 
 
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in many countries1. 
363 
Genetic factors play an important role in breast cancer etiology. Multiple high- and moderate-
364 
penetrance genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2 and ATM, have been identified as 
365 
contributors to familial breast cancer2,3. However, deleterious germline mutations in these genes 
366 
are rare, thus accounting for only a small fraction of breast cancer cases in the general 
367 
population4,5. Since 2007, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 
368 
approximately 180 genetic loci harboring common, low-penetrance variants for breast cancer6-13, 
369 
but these more common variants explain less than 20% of familial relative risk7. 
370 
 
371 
A large proportion of disease-associated risk variants identified by GWAS are located in non-
372 
protein coding or intergenic regions and are not in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with any 
373 
nonsynonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)14. Many of these susceptibility 
374 
variants are located in gene regulatory elements15,16, and it has therefore been hypothesized that 
375 
most of the GWAS-identified associations may be driven by the regulatory function of risk 
376 
variants on the expression levels of nearby genes. For breast cancer, recent studies have shown 
377 
that GWAS-identified associations at 1p34, 1p36, 2q35, 5p12, 5p15.33, 5q11.2, 5q14, 6q25, 
378 
7q22, 9q31.2, 10q21.3, 10q26.13, 11p15, 11q13.3, 15q26.1, 19p13 and 19q13.31 are likely due 
379 
to the effect of risk variants at these loci on regulating the expression of either nearby or more 
380 
distal genes: CITED4, KLHDC7A, IGFBP5, FGF10/MRPS30, TERT, MAP3K1, ATP6AP1L, 
381 
RMND1, RASA4/PRKRIP1, KLF4, NRBF2, FGFR2, PIDD1, CCND1, RCCD1, ABHD8, and 
382 
ZNF4047,9,10,13,17-22. However, for the large majority of the GWAS-identified breast cancer risk 
383 
loci, the genes responsible for the associations remain unknown.  
384 
 
385 
 Wu et al. – Page 11 
 
Several recent studies have reported that regulatory variants may account for a large proportion 
386 
of disease heritability not yet discovered through GWAS23-25. Many of these variants may have a 
387 
small effect size, and thus are difficult to identify in individual SNP-based GWAS studies, even 
388 
with a very large sample size. Applying gene-based approaches that aggregate the effects of 
389 
multiple variants into a single testing unit may increase study power to identify novel disease-
390 
associated loci. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) systematically investigate 
391 
across the transcriptome the association of genetically predicted gene expression with disease 
392 
risk, providing an effective approach to identify novel susceptibility genes26-29. Instead of testing 
393 
millions of SNPs in GWAS, TWAS evaluate the association of predicted expression for selected 
394 
genes, thus greatly reducing the burden of multiple comparisons in statistical inference. 
395 
Recently, Hoffman et al performed a TWAS including 15,440 cases and 31,159 controls and 
396 
reported significant associations for five genes with breast cancer risk30. However, the sample 
397 
size of that study was relatively small and several reported associations were not statistically 
398 
significant after Bonferroni correction. Herein, we report results from a larger TWAS of breast 
399 
cancer that used the MetaXcan method26 to analyze summary statistics data from 122,977 cases 
400 
and 105,974 controls of European descent from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium 
401 
(BCAC).

Results 
404 
Gene expression prediction models 
405 
The overall study design is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. We used transcriptome and 
406 
high-density genotyping data from 67 women of European descent included in the Genotype-
407 
Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to build genetic models to predict RNA expression levels for 
408 
 Wu et al. – Page 12 
 
each of the genes expressed in normal breast tissues, by applying the elastic net method (�=0.5) 
409 
with ten-fold cross-validation. Genetically regulated expression was estimated for each gene 
410 
using variants within a 2 MB window flanking the respective gene boundaries, inclusive. SNPs 
411 
with a minor allele frequency of at least 0.05 and included in the HapMap Phase 2 subset were 
412 
used for model building. Of the models built for 12,696 genes, 9,109 showed a prediction 
413 
performance (R2) of at least 0.01 (≥10% correlation between predicted and observed expression). 
414 
For genes for which the expression could not be predicted well using this approach, we built 
415 
models using only SNPs located in the promoter or enhancer regions, as predicted using three 
416 
breast cell lines in the Roadmap Epigenomics Project/Encyclopedia of DNA Elements Project. 
417 
This approach leverages information from functional genomics and reduces the number of 
418 
variants for variable selection, and therefore potentially improving statistical power. This 
419 
enabled us to build genetic models for additional 3,715 genes with R2≥0.01. Supplementary 
420 
Table 1 provides detailed information regarding the performance threshold and types of models 
421 
built in this study. Overall, genes that were predicted with R2≥0.01 in GTEx data were also 
422 
predicted well in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) tumor-adjacent normal tissue data 
423 
(correlation coefficient of 0.55 for R2 in two datasets; Supplementary Figure 2). Based on 
424 
model performance in GTEx and TCGA, we prioritized 8,597 genes for analyses of the 
425 
associations between predicted gene expression and breast cancer risk using the following 
426 
criteria: 1) genes with a model prediction R2 of at least 0.01 in the GTEx set (10% correlation) 
427 
and a Spearman’s correlation coefficient of >0.1 in the external validation experiment using 
428 
TCGA data, 2) genes with a prediction R2 of at least 0.09 (30% correlation) in the GTEx set 
429 
regardless of their performance in the TCGA set, 3) genes with a prediction R2 of at least 0.01 in 
430 
 Wu et al. – Page 13 
 
the GTEx set (10% correlation) that could not be evaluated in the TCGA set because of a lack of 
431 
data.  
432 
 
433 
Association analyses of predicted gene expression with breast cancer risk 
434 
Using the MetaXcan method26, we performed association analyses to evaluate predicted gene 
435 
expression and breast cancer risk using the meta-analysis summary statistics of individual 
436 
genetic variants generated for 122,977 breast cancer cases and 105,974 controls of European 
437 
ancestry included in BCAC. For the majority of the tested genes, most of the SNPs selected for 
438 
prediction models were used for the association analyses (e.g., ≥95% predicting SNPs used for 
439 
83.8% of the tested genes, and ≥80% predicting SNPs used for 95.6% of the tested genes). 
440 
Lambda 1,000 (�1,000), a standardized estimate of the genomic inflation scaling to a study of 
441 
1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, was 1.004 in our study (Quantile-quantile (QQ) plot presented in 
442 
Supplementary Figure 3 (A)). Of the 8,597 genes evaluated in this study, we identified 179 
443 
genes whose predicted expression was associated with breast cancer risk at P<1.05×10-3, a FDR-
444 
corrected significance level (Figure 1, Supplementary Table 2). Of these, 48 showed a 
445 
significant association at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P≤5.82×10-6 (Figure 1, Tables 1-
446 
3), including 14 genes located at 11 loci that are 500 kb away from any of the risk variants 
447 
identified in previous GWAS of breast cancer risk (Table 1). An association between lower 
448 
predicted expression and increased breast cancer risk was detected for LRRC3B (3p24.1), 
449 
SPATA18 (4q12), UBD (6p22.1), MIR31HG (9p21.3), RIC8A (11p15.5), B3GNT1 (11q13.2), 
450 
GALNT16 (14q24.1) and MAN2C1 and CTD-2323K18.1 (15q24.2). Conversely, an association 
451 
between higher predicted expression and increased breast cancer risk was identified for ZSWIM5 
452 
(1p34.1), KLHDC10 (7q32.2), RP11-867G23.10 (11q13.2), RP11-218M22.1 (12p13.33) and 
453 
 Wu et al. – Page 14 
 
PLEKHD1 (14q24.1). The remaining 34 significantly associated genes are all located at breast 
454 
cancer susceptibility loci identified in previous GWAS (Tables 2-3). Among them, 23 have not 
455 
yet been previously implicated as genes responsible for association signals with breast cancer 
456 
risk identified at these loci through expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and/or functional 
457 
studies, and do not harbor GWAS or fine-mapping identified risk variants (Table 2), while the 
458 
other eleven (KLHDC7A
7, ALS2CR1231, CASP831,32, ATG109, SNX3233, STXBP434,35 , ZNF4048, 
459 
ATP6AP1L9, RMND117, L3MBTL36, and RCCD110) had been reported as potential causal genes 
460 
at breast cancer susceptibility loci or harbor GWAS or fine-mapping identified risk variants 
461 
(Table 3). Except for RP11-73O6.3 and L3MBTL3, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in 
462 
the gene-expression association (I2<0.2) across the iCOGS, OncoArray, and GWAS datasets 
463 
included in our analyses (Supplementary Table 3). Overall, through our agnostic search, we 
464 
identified 37 novel susceptibility genes for breast cancer, including 21 protein-coding genes, 15 
465 
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and a processed transcript, and confirmed eleven genes 
466 
known to potentially play a role in breast cancer susceptibility. 
467 
 
468 
To determine whether the associations between predicted gene expression and breast cancer risk 
469 
were independent of the association signals identified in previous GWAS, we performed 
470 
conditional analyses adjusting for the GWAS-identified risk SNPs closest to the TWAS-
471 
identified gene (Supplementary Table 4)36. We found that the associations for 11 genes 
472 
(LRRC3B, SPATA18, KLHDC10, MIR31HG, RIC8A, B3GNT1, RP11-218M22.1, MAN2C1, 
473 
CTD-2323K18.1 (Table 1), ALK, CTD-3051D23.1 (Table 2)) remained statistically significant 
474 
at P<5.82×10-6 (Tables 1-3). This suggests the expression of these genes may be associated with 
475 
breast cancer risk independent of the GWAS-identified risk variant(s). For nine of the genes 
476 
 Wu et al. – Page 15 
 
(SPATA18, KLHDC10, MIR31HG, RIC8A, RP11-218M22.1, MAN2C1, CTD-2323K18.1 (Table 
477 
1), ALK, and CTD-3051D23.1 (Table 2)), the significance level of the association remained 
478 
essentially unchanged, suggesting these associations may be entirely independent of GWAS-
479 
identified association signals. 
480 
 
481 
Of the 131 genes showing a significant association at P values between 5.82×10-6 and 1.05×10-3 
482 
(significant after FDR-correction but not Bonferroni-correction), 38 are located at GWAS-
483 
identified breast cancer risk loci (± 500 kb of the index SNPs) (Table 4). Except for RP11-
484 
400F19.8, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in TWAS association (I2<0.2) across the 
485 
iCOGS, OncoArray, and GWAS studies (Supplementary Table 3). After adjusting for the index 
486 
SNPs, breast cancer associations for MTHFD1L, PVT1, RP11-123K19.1, FES, RP11-400F19.8, 
487 
CTD-2538G9.5, and CTD-3216D2.5 remained significant at p ≤ 1.05×10-3, again suggesting that 
488 
the association of these genes with breast cancer risk may be independent of the GWAS-
489 
identified association signals (Table 4).  
490 
 
491 
For 41 of the 48 associated genes that reached the Bonferroni-corrected significant level, we 
492 
obtained individual-level data from subjects included in the iCOGS (n=84,740) and OncoArray 
493 
(n=112,133) datasets, which was 86% of the subjects included in the analysis using summary 
494 
statistics (Supplementary Table 5). The results from the analysis using individual-level data 
495 
were very similar to those described above using MetaXcan analyses (Pearson correlation of z-
496 
scores was 0.991 for iCOGS data and 0.994 for OncoArray data), although not all associations 
497 
reached the Bonferroni-corrected significant level, possibly due to a smaller sample size 
498 
(Supplementary Table 5). Conditional analyses using individual level data also revealed 
499 
 Wu et al. – Page 16 
 
consistent results compared with analyses using summary data. We found that for several genes 
500 
within the same genomic region, their predicted expression levels were correlated with each 
501 
other (Tables 1-3). The associations between predicted expression of PLEKHD1 and ZSWIM5 
502 
and breast cancer risk were largely influenced by their corresponding closest risk variants 
503 
identified in GWAS, although these risk variants are >500 kb away from these genes (Table 1). 
504 
There were significant correlation of rs999737 and rs1707302 with genetically predicted 
505 
expression of PLEKHD1 (r = -0.47 in the OncoArray dataset and -0.48 in the iCOGS dataset) 
506 
and ZSWIM5 (r = 0.50 in the OncoArray dataset and 0.51 in the iCOGS dataset), respectively. 
507 
 
508 
INQUISIT algorithm scores for the identified genes 
509 
For the 48 associated genes after Bonferroni correction, we assessed their integrated expression 
510 
quantitative trait and in silico prediction of GWAS target (INQUISIT) scores7 to assess whether 
511 
there are other lines of evidence beyond the scope of eQTL for supporting our TWAS-identified 
512 
genes as candidate target genes at GWAS-identified loci. The detailed methodology for 
513 
INQUISIT scores have been described elsewhere7. In brief, a score for each gene-SNP pair is 
514 
calculated across categories representing potential regulatory mechanisms - distal or proximal 
515 
gene regulation (promoter). Features contributing to the score are based on functionally 
516 
important genomic annotations such as chromatin interactions, transcription factor binding, and 
517 
eQTLs. Compared with evidence from eQTL only, INQUISIT scores incorporate additional lines 
518 
of evidence, including distal regulations. The INQUISIT scores for our identified genes are 
519 
shown in Supplementary Table 6. Except for UBD with a very low score in the distal regulation 
520 
category (0.05), none of the genes at novel loci (Table 1) showed evidence to be potential target 
521 
genes for any of the GWAS-identified breast cancer susceptibility loci. This is interesting and 
522 
 Wu et al. – Page 17 
 
within the expectation since these genes may represent novel association signals. There was 
523 
evidence suggesting that RP11-439A17.7, NUDT17, ANKRD34A, BTN3A2, AP006621.6, 
524 
RPLP2, LRRC37A2, LRRC37A, KANSL1-AS1, CRHR1 and HAPLN4 listed in Table 2, and all 
525 
eleven genes listed in Table 3, may be target genes for risk variants identified in GWAS at these 
526 
loci (Supplementary Table 6). For NUDT17, ANKRD34A, RPLP2, LRRC37A2, LRRC37A, 
527 
KANSL1-AS1, CRHR1, HAPLN4, KLHDC7A, ALS2CR12, CASP8, ATG10, ATP6AP1L, 
528 
L3MBTL3, RMND1, SNX32, RCCD1, STXBP4 and ZNF404, the INQUISIT scores were not 
529 
derived only from eQTL data, providing orthogonal support for these loci. For these loci, the 
530 
associations of candidate causal SNPs with breast cancer risk may be mediated through these 
531 
genes. This is in general consistent with the findings from the conditional analyses described 
532 
above.  
533 
 
534 
Pathway enrichment analyses 
535 
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)37 suggested potential enrichment of cancer-related functions 
536 
for the significantly associated protein-coding genes identified in this study (Supplementary 
537 
Table 7). The top canonical pathways identified in these analyses included apoptosis related 
538 
pathways (Granzyme B signaling (p=0.024) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis of 
539 
target cells (p=0.046)), immune system pathway (inflammasome pathway (p=0.030)), and 
540 
tumoricidal function of hepatic natural killer cells (p=0.036). The identified pathways are largely 
541 
consistent with findings in previous studies7. For the significantly associated lncRNAs identified 
542 
in this study, pathway analysis of their highly co-expressed protein-coding genes also revealed 
543 
potential over-representation of cancer related functions (Supplementary Table 7).

Knockdown of predicted risk-associated genes in breast cells 
546 
To assess the function of genes whose high levels of predicted expression were associated with 
547 
increased breast cancer risk, we selected 13 genes for knockdown experiments in breast cells: 
548 
ZSWIM5, KLHDC10, RP11-218M22.1 and PLEKHD1 (Table 1), UBLCP1, AP006621.6, RP11-
549 
467J12.4, CTD-3032H12.1 and RP11-15A1.7 (Table 2), and ALS2CR12, RMND1, STXBP4 and 
550 
ZNF404 (Table 3). As negative controls, we selected B2M, ARHGDIA and ZAP70 using the 
551 
following criteria: 1) at least 2 MB from any known breast cancer risk locus; 2) not an essential 
552 
gene in breast cancer38,39; and 3) not predicted to be a target gene in INQUISIT. In addition, as 
553 
positive controls, we included in the experiments PIDD1 (Table 4)7, NRBF220 and ABHD822, 
554 
which have been functionally validated as the target genes at breast cancer risk loci. We 
555 
performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) on a panel of three ‘normal’ mammary epithelial and 15 
556 
breast cancer cell lines to analyze their expression level (Supplementary Figure 4 and 
557 
Supplementary Table 8). All 19 genes were expressed in the normal mammary epithelial line 
558 
184A140 and the luminal breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and T47D, so we used these cell lines 
559 
for the proliferation assay, and MCF7 for the colony formation assay41. We also evaluated 
560 
SNX32, ALK and BTN3A2 by qPCR, but they were not expressed in T47D and MCF7 cells; 
561 
therefore they were not evaluated further. It was difficult to design siRNAs against RP11-
562 
867G23.1 and RP11-53O19.1 because they both have multiple transcripts with limited, GC-rich 
563 
regions in common. We did not include RPLP2 because it is already known to be an essential 
564 
gene for breast cancer survival42. Knockdown of the 19 tested genes was achieved by small short 
565 
interfering RNA (siRNA) (Supplementary Table 9) and the knockdown efficiency was 
566 
calculated in 184A1, MCF7 and T47D for each siRNA pair. Robust knockdown of the gene of 
567 
 Wu et al. – Page 19 
 
interests (GOI) was validated by qPCR with the majority of the siRNAs (Supplementary Figure 
568 
5).  
569 
 
570 
To evaluate the survival and proliferation ability of cells following gene interruption, we used an 
571 
IncuCyte to quantify cell proliferation in real time and quantified the corrected proliferation of 
572 
cells with knocking down of GOI in comparison to that of cells with non-target control (NTC) 
573 
siRNA). As expected, knockdown of the three negative control genes (B2M, ARHGDIA and 
574 
ZAP70) did not significantly change cell proliferation in any of the three cell lines (Figure 2A, 
575 
Supplementary Figure 6). However, with the exception of UBLCP1, RMND1 and STXBP4, 
576 
knockdown of all other genes (11 TWAS-identified genes along with two known genes, ABHD8 
577 
and NRBF2) resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation in 184A1 normal breast cells, 
578 
with KLHDC10, PLEKHD1, RP11-218M22.1, AP006621.6, ZNF404, RP11-467J12.4, CTD-
579 
3032H12.1 and STXBP4 showing a similar effect in one or both cancer cell lines. Down-
580 
regulation of three lncRNAs (RP11-218M22.1, RP11-467J12.4 and CTD-3032H12.1) resulted in 
581 
significant reduction in cell proliferation in all three cell lines. We also evaluated the effect of 
582 
inhibition of these genes on colony forming ability in MCF7 cells. Knockdown of the three 
583 
negative control genes did not significantly affect colony forming efficiency (CFE). By contrast, 
584 
knockdown of PIDD1, RP11-15A1.7, RP11-218M22.1, AP006621.6, ZNF404, RP11-467J12.4 
585 
and CTD-3032H12.1 resulted in significantly decreased colony forming efficiency in MCF7 cells 
586 
compared to the NTC (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure 7).  
587 
 
588 
Discussion 
589 
This is the largest study to systematically evaluate associations of genetically predicted gene 
590 
 Wu et al. – Page 20 
 
expression across the human transcriptome with breast cancer risk. We identified 179 genes 
591 
showing a significant association at the FDR-corrected significance level. Of these, 48 showed a 
592 
significant association at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold, including 14 genes at genomic loci 
593 
that have not previously been implicated for breast cancer risk. Of the 34 genes we identified that 
594 
are located at known risk loci, 23 have not previously been shown to be the targets of GWAS-
595 
identified risk SNPs at corresponding loci and not harbor any risk SNPs. Our study provides 
596 
substantial new information to improve the understanding of genetics and etiology for breast 
597 
cancer, the most common malignancy among women in most countries. 
598 
 
599 
It is possible that TWAS-identified genes may be associated with breast cancer risk through their 
600 
correlation with disease causal genes. To determine the potential functional significance of 
601 
TWAS-identified genes and provide evidence for causal inference, we knocked down 13 genes 
602 
for which high predicted levels of expression were associated with an increased breast cancer 
603 
risk, in one normal and two breast cancer cell lines, and measured the effect on proliferation and 
604 
colony forming efficiency. Although there was some variation between cell lines, knockdown of 
605 
11 of the 13 genes showed an effect in at least one cell line, particularly on proliferation in 
606 
184A1 normal breast cells; the effects were strongest and most consistent for the lncRNAs, 
607 
RP11-218M22.1, RP11-467J12.4 and CTD-3032H12.1. The observation of a more consistent 
608 
effect in the normal breast cell line compared with the cancer cell lines is not surprising as cancer 
609 
cell lines have increased capacity to handle gene interference through mutations which enhance 
610 
cell survival. Rewiring of pathways and compensatory mechanisms is a hallmark of cancer. 
611 
Knockdown of PIDD1, NRBF2 and ABHD8¸ for which breast cancer risk associated haplotypes 
612 
have been shown to be associated with increased expression in reporter assays7,20,22, affected 
613 
 Wu et al. – Page 21 
 
either proliferation or colony forming efficiency, supporting the results from this study. 
614 
Knockdown of UBLCP1 and RMND1 did not affect proliferation or colony formation but they 
615 
could mediate breast cancer risk through other mechanisms. 
616 
 
617 
Some of the genes with strong functional evidence from our study have been reported to have 
618 
important roles in carcinogenesis. For example, RP11-467J12.4 (PR-lncRNA-1) is a p53-
619 
regulated lncRNA that modulates gene expression in response to DNA damage downstream of 
620 
p5343. STXBP4 encodes Syntaxin binding protein 4, a scaffold protein that can stabilise and 
621 
prevent degradation of an isoform of p63, a member of the p53 tumor suppressor family44. 
622 
KLHDC10 encodes a member of the Kelch superfamily that can activate apoptosis signal-
623 
regulating kinase 1, contributing to oxidative stress-induced cell death45. Notably, another 
624 
member of this superfamily, KLHDC7A, has recently been identified as the target gene at the 
625 
1p36 breast cancer risk locus7.  
626 
 
627 
SNX32, ALK and BTN3A2 are also likely susceptibility genes for breast cancer risk. However, 
628 
their low or absent expression in our chosen breast cell lines prevented further functional 
629 
analysis. SNX32 (Sorting Nexin 32) is not well characterized, but ALK (Anaplastic lymphoma 
630 
kinase) copy number gain and overexpression have been reported in aggressive and metastatic 
631 
breast cancers46. Therapeutic targeting of ALK rearrangement has significantly improved 
632 
survival in advanced ALK-positive lung cancer47, making it an attractive target for breast and 
633 
other cancers. BTN3A2 is a member of the B7/butyrophilin-like group of Ig superfamily 
634 
receptors modulating the function of T-lymphocytes. While the exact role of BTN3A2 remains 
635 
 Wu et al. – Page 22 
 
unknown, over-expression of this gene in epithelial ovarian cancer is associated with higher 
636 
infiltrating immune cells and a better prognosis48.  
637 
 
638 
Our analyses identified multiple genes with reduced expression levels associated with increased 
639 
breast cancer risk. Among them, LRRC3B and CASP8 are putative tumor suppressors in multiple 
640 
cancers, including breast cancer. Leucine-rich repeat-containing 3B (LRRC3B) is a putative 
641 
LRR-containing transmembrane protein, which is frequently inactivated via promoter 
642 
hypermethylation leading to inhibition of cancer cell growth, proliferation, and invasion49. 
643 
CASP8 encodes a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease family, which play a central role 
644 
in cell apoptosis. Previous studies have suggested that caspase-8 may act as a tumor suppressor 
645 
in certain types of lung cancer and neuroblastoma, although this function has not yet been 
646 
demonstrated in breast cancer. Notably, several large association studies have identified SNPs at 
647 
the 2q33/CASP8 locus associated with increased breast cancer risk31,50. Consistent with our data, 
648 
eQTL analyses showed that the risk alleles for breast cancer were associated with reduced 
649 
CASP8 mRNA levels in both peripheral blood lymphocytes and normal breast tissue31.  
650 
 
651 
For seven of the genes listed in Tables 1 and 2, we found some evidence from studies using 
652 
tumor tissues, in vitro or in vivo experiments linking them to cancer risk (Supplementary Table 
653 
10), although their association with breast cancer has not been previously demonstrated in human 
654 
studies. For five of them, including LRRC3B, SPATA18, RIC8A, ALK and CRHR1, previous in 
655 
vitro and in vivo experiments and human tissue studies showed a consistent direction of the 
656 
association as demonstrated in our studies. For two other genes (UBD and MIR31HG), however, 
657 
results from previous studies were inconsistent, reporting both potential promoting and inhibiting 
658 
 Wu et al. – Page 23 
 
effects on breast cancer development. Future studies are needed to evaluate functions of these 
659 
genes. 
660 
 
661 
We included a large number of cases and controls in this study, providing strong statistical power 
662 
for the association analysis. This large sample size enabled us to identify a large number of 
663 
candidate breast cancer susceptibility genes, much larger than the number identified in a TWAS 
664 
study with a sample size of about 20% of ours30. The previous study included subjects of 
665 
different races, which could affect the results as linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns differ by 
666 
races. Of the five genes reported in that smaller TWAS that showed a suggestive association with 
667 
breast cancer risk, the association for the RCCD1 gene was replicated in our study (Table 3). 
668 
The other four genes (ANKLE1, DHODH, ACAP1 and LRRC25) were not evaluated in our study 
669 
because of unsatisfactory performance of our breast specific models for these genes which were 
670 
built using the GTEx reference dataset including only female European descendants. In our 
671 
study, the expression prediction model for ANKLE1 has a marginal performance in predicting 
672 
gene expression (R2=0.013 in the GTEx). The model, however, did not perform well in the 
673 
TCGA data. For ACAP1 and LRRC25, previous results for suggestive associations were based on 
674 
blood tissue models. 
675 
 
676 
A substantial proportion of SNPs included in the OncoArray and iCOGS were selected from 
677 
breast cancer GWAS and fine-mapping analyses, and thus these arrays were enriched for 
678 
association signals with breast cancer risk. As a result, the overall � value for the BCAC 
679 
association analyses of individual variants is 1.26 after adjusting for population stratifications 
680 
(QQ plot in Supplementary Figure 3 (B))7. The � value for the associations of the ~257,000 
681 
 Wu et al. – Page 24 
 
SNPs included in the gene expression prediction models of the 8,597 genes tested in our 
682 
association analysis is 1.40 (QQ plot in Supplementary Figure 3 (C)). This higher � value is 
683 
perhaps expected because of a potential further enrichment of breast cancer associated signals in 
684 
the set of SNPs selected to predict gene expression. There could be additional gain of power (and 
685 
thus a higher � value) in TWAS as it aggregates the effect of multiple SNPs to predict gene 
686 
expression and use genes as the unit for association analyses. The lambda (�) for our associated 
687 
analyses of 8,597 genes was 1.51 (QQ plot presented in Supplementary Figure 3 (A)) likely 
688 
due to the potential enrichment and power gain discussed above as well as our large sample size, 
689 
and the highly polygenic nature of the disease7,51. Interestingly, high � values were also found in 
690 
recent large studies of other polygenic traits, such as body mass index (BMI) (� = 1.99) and 
691 
height (� = 2.7)52,53. The �1,000, a standardized estimate of the genomic inflation scaling to a study 
692 
of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, is 1.004 in our study. 
693 
 
694 
The statistical power of our study is very large to detect associations for genes with a relatively 
695 
high cis-heritability (h2) (Supplementary Figure 8). For example, our study has 80% statistical 
696 
power to detect an association with breast cancer risk at P<5.82×10-6 with an OR of 1.07 or 
697 
higher per one standard deviation increase (or decrease) in the expression level of genes with an 
698 
h2 of 0.1 or higher. One limitation of our study is the small sample size for building gene 
699 
expression prediction models, which may have affected the precision of model parameter 
700 
estimates. The prediction performance (R2) for several of the genes identified in our study was 
701 
not optimal, and thus additional research is needed to confirm our findings. We expect that 
702 
models built with a larger sample size (and thus with more stable estimates of model parameters) 
703 
will identify additional association signals. We used samples from women of European origin in 
704 
 Wu et al. – Page 25 
 
model building, given differences in gene expression patterns between males and females and in 
705 
genetic architecture across ethnicities54. We also used gene expression data of tumor-adjacent 
706 
normal tissue samples from European descendants in TCGA as an external validation step to 
707 
prioritize genes for association analyses. Given potential somatic alterations in tumor-adjacent 
708 
normal tissues, we retained all models showing a prediction performance (R2) of at least 0.09 in 
709 
GTEx, regardless of their performance in TCGA. Not all genes have a significant hereditary 
710 
component in expression regulation, and thus these genes could not be investigated in our study. 
711 
For example, previous studies have provided strong evidence to support a significant role of the 
712 
TERT, ESR1, CCND1, IGFBP5, TET2 and MRPS30 genes in the etiology of breast cancer. 
713 
However, expression of these genes cannot be predicted well using the data from female 
714 
European descendants included in the GTEx and thus they were not included in our association 
715 
analyses. Supplementary Table 11 summarizes the performance of prediction models and 
716 
association results for breast cancer target genes reported previously at GWAS-identified loci.  
717 
 
718 
In summary, our study has identified multiple gene candidates that can be further functionally 
719 
characterized. By evaluating the associations of predicted gene expression levels with breast 
720 
cancer risk, we provided evidence for the direction of the association for the identified genes. 
721 
The silencing experiments we performed suggest that many of the genes identified by TWAS are 
722 
likely to mediate risk of breast cancer by affecting proliferation or colony forming efficiency, 
723 
two of the hallmarks of cancer. Further investigation of genes identified in our study will provide 
724 
additional insight into the biology and genetics of breast cancer. 
725 
 
726 
Methods 
727 
 Wu et al. – Page 26 
 
Building of gene expression prediction models  
728 
We used transcriptome and high-density genotyping data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression 
729 
(GTEx) study to establish prediction models for genes expressed in normal breast tissues. Details 
730 
of the GTEx have been described elsewhere55. Genomic DNA samples obtained from study 
731 
subjects included in the GTEx were genotyped using Illumina OMNI 5M or 2.5M SNP Array 
732 
and RNA samples from 51 tissue sites were sequenced to generate transcriptome profiling data. 
733 
Genotype data were processed according to the GTEx protocol 
734 
(http://www.gtexportal.org/home/documentationPage). SNPs with a call rate < 98%, with 
735 
differential missingness between the two array experiments (5M/2.5M Arrays), with Hardy-
736 
Weinberg equilibrium p-value < 10-6 (among subjects of European ancestry), or showing batch 
737 
effects were excluded. One Klinefelter individual, three related individuals, and a chromosome 
738 
17 trisomy individual were also excluded. The genotype data were imputed to the Haplotype 
739 
Reference Consortium reference panel56 using Minimac3 for imputation and SHAPEIT for 
740 
prephasing57,58. SNPs with high imputation quality (r2 ≥ 0.8), minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 
741 
0.05, and included in the HapMap Phase 2 version, were used to build expression prediction 
742 
models. For gene expression data, we used Reads Per Kilobase per Million (RPKM) units from 
743 
RNA-SeQC59. Genes with a median expression level of 0 RPKM across samples were removed, 
744 
and the RPKM values of each gene were log2 transformed. We performed quantile normalization 
745 
to bring the expression profile of each sample to the same scale, and performed inverse quantile 
746 
normalization for each gene to map each set of expression values to a standard normal. We 
747 
adjusted for the top ten principal components (PCs) derived from genotype data and the top 15 
748 
probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER) factors to correct for batch effects and 
749 
experimental confounders in model building60. Genetic and transcriptome data from 67 female 
750 
 Wu et al. – Page 27 
 
subjects of European descent without a prior breast cancer diagnosis were used to build gene 
751 
expression prediction models for this study. 
752 
 
753 
We built an expression prediction model for each gene by using the elastic net method as 
754 
implemented in the glmnet R package, with �=0.5, as recommended by Gamazon et al27. The 
755 
genetically regulated expression for each gene was estimated by including variants within a 2 
756 
MB window flanking the respective gene boundaries, inclusive. Expression prediction models 
757 
were built for protein coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), 
758 
processed transcripts, immunoglobulin genes, and T cell receptor genes, according to categories 
759 
described in the Gencode V19 annotation file (http://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/19.html). 
760 
Pseudogenes were not included in the present study because of potential concerns of inaccurate 
761 
calling61. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to validate the models internally. Prediction R2 
762 
values (the square of the correlation between predicted and observed expression) were generated 
763 
to estimate the prediction performance of each of the gene prediction models established.  
764 
 
765 
For genes that cannot be predicted well using the above approach, we built models using only 
766 
SNPs located in predicted promoter or enhancer regions in breast cell lines. This approach 
767 
reduces the number of variants for model building, and thus potentially improves model 
768 
accuracy, by increasing the ratio of sample size to effective degrees of freedom.  
769 
SNP-level annotation data in three breast cell lines, namely, Breast Myoepithelial Primary Cells 
770 
(E027), Breast variant Human Mammary Epithelial Cells (vHMEC) (E028), and HMEC 
771 
Mammary Epithelial Primary Cells (E119) in the Roadmap Epigenomics Project/Encyclopedia 
772 
of DNA Elements Project16, were downloaded from 
773 
 Wu et al. – Page 28 
 
http://archive.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/data/ (Version 4.0, assessed on December 6, 
774 
2016). SNPs in regions classified as promoters (TssA, TssAFlnk), enhancers (Enh, EnhG), or  
775 
regions with both promoter and enhancer signatures (ExFlnk) according to the core 15 chromatin 
776 
state model16 in at least one of the cell lines were retained as input SNPs for model building.  
777 
 
778 
Evaluating performance of gene expression prediction models using The Cancer Genome 
779 
Atlas (TCGA) data 
780 
To assess further the validity of the models, we performed external validation using data 
781 
generated in tumor-adjacent normal breast tissue samples obtained from 86 European-ancestry 
782 
female breast cancer patients included in the TCGA. Genotype data were imputed using the same 
783 
approach as described for GTEx data. Expression data were processed and normalized using a 
784 
similar approach as described above. The predicted expression level for each gene was calculated 
785 
using the model established using GTEx data and then compared with the observed level of that 
786 
gene using the Spearman’s correlation.  
787 
 
788 
Evaluating statistical power for association tests 
789 
We conducted a simulation analysis to assess the power of our TWAS analysis. Specifically, we 
790 
set the number of cases and controls to be 122,977 and 105,974, respectively, and generated the 
791 
gene expression levels from the empirical distribution of predicted gene expression levels in the 
792 
BCAC. We calculated statistical power at P<5.82×10-6 (the significance level used in our 
793 
TWAS) according to cis-heritability (h2) which we aim to capture using gene expression 
794 
prediction models (R2). The results based on 1000 replicates are summarized in Supplementary 
795 
Figure 8. Based on the power calculation, our TWAS analysis has 80% power to detect a 
796 
 Wu et al. – Page 29 
 
minimum odds ratio of 1.11, 1.07, 1.05, 1.04, or 1.03 for breast cancer risk per one standard 
797 
deviation increase (or decrease) in the expression level of a gene whose cis-heritability is 5%, 
798 
10%, 20%, 40%, or 60%, respectively. 
799 
 
800 
Association analyses of predicted gene expression with breast cancer risk 
801 
We used the following criteria to select genes for the association analysis: 1) with a model 
802 
prediction R2 of ≥ 0.01 in GTEx and a Spearman’s correlation coefficient of ≥ 0.1 in TCGA, 2) 
803 
with a prediction R2 of ≥ 0.09 in GTEx regardless of the performance in TCGA, 3) with a 
804 
prediction R2 of ≥ 0.01 in GTEx but unable to be evaluated in TCGA. The second group of genes 
805 
was selected because some gene expression levels might have changed in TCGA tumor-adjacent 
806 
normal tissues, and thus it is anticipated that some genes may show low prediction performance 
807 
in TCGA data due to the influence of tumor growth62,63. Overall, a total of 8,597 genes met the 
808 
criteria and were evaluated for their expression-trait associations.  
809 
 
810 
To identify novel breast cancer susceptibility loci and genes, the MetaXcan method, as described 
811 
elsewhere, was used for the association analyses26. Briefly, the formula:  
812

817 
Therefore, the weights for predicting gene expression, GWAS summary statistics results, and 
818 
 Wu et al. – Page 30 
 
correlations between model predicting SNPs are the input variables for the MetaXcan analyses. 
819 
For this study we estimated correlations between SNPs included in the prediction models using 
820 
the phase 3, 1000 Genomes Project data focusing on European population. 
821 
 
822 
For the association analysis, we used the summary statistics data of genetic variants associated 
823 
with breast cancer risk generated in 122,977 breast cancer patients and 105,974 controls of 
824 
European ancestry from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The details of the 
825 
BCAC have been described elsewhere7,9,13,64,65. Briefly, 46,785 breast cancer cases and 42,892 
826 
controls of European ancestry were genotyped using a custom Illumina iSelect genotyping array 
827 
(iCOGS) containing ~211,155 variants. A further 61,282 cases and 45,494 controls of European 
828 
ancestry were genotyped using the OncoArray including 570,000 SNPs 
829 
(http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/oncoarray/). Also included in this analysis were data from nine 
830 
GWAS studies including 14,910 breast cancer cases and 17,588 controls of European ancestry. 
831 
Genotype data from iCOGS, OncoArray and GWAS were imputed using the October 2014 
832 
release of the 1000 Genomes Project data as reference. Genetic association results for breast 
833 
cancer risk were combined using inverse variance fixed effect meta-analyses7. For our study, 
834 
only SNPs with imputation r2 ≥ 0.3 were used. All participating BCAC studies were approved by 
835 
their appropriate ethics review boards. This study was approved by the BCAC Data Access 
836 
Coordination Committee. 
837 
 
838 
Lambda 1,000 (�1,000) was calculated to represent a standardized estimate of the genomic 
839 
inflation scaling to a study of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, using the following formula: 
840 
�1,000=1+(�obs-1) × (1/ncases+1/ncontrols)/(1/1,000cases+1/1,000controls)66,67. We used a Bonferroni 
841 
 Wu et al. – Page 31 
 
corrected p threshold of 5.82×10-6 (0.05/8,597) to determine a statistically significant association 
842 
for the primary analyses. To identify additional gene candidates at previously identified 
843 
susceptibility loci, we also used a false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p threshold of 1.05×10-3 
844 
(FDR ≤ 0.05) to determine a significant association. Associated genes with an expression of >0.1 
845 
RPKM in less than 10 individuals in GTEx data were excluded as the corresponding prediction 
846 
models may not be stable.  
847 
 
848 
To determine whether the predicted expression-trait associations were independent of the top 
849 
signals identified in previous GWAS, we performed GCTA-COJO analyses developed by Yang 
850 
et al36 to calculate association betas and standard errors of variants with breast cancer risk after 
851 
adjusting for the index SNPs of interest. We then re-ran the MetaXcan analyses using the 
852 
association statistics after conditioning on the index SNPs. This information was used to 
853 
determine whether the detected expression-trait associations remained significant after adjusting 
854 
for the index SNPs.  
855 
 
856 
For 41 identified associated genes at the Bonferroni-corrected threshold, we also performed 
857 
analyses using individual level data in iCOGS (n=84,740) and OncoArray (n=112,133) datasets. 
858 
We generated predicted gene expression using predicting SNPs, and then assessed the 
859 
association between predicted gene expression and breast cancer risk adjusting for study and 
860 
nine principal components in iCOGS dataset, and country and the first ten principal components 
861 
in OncoArray dataset. Conditional analyses adjusting for index SNPs were performed to assess 
862 
potential influence of reported index SNPs on the association between predicted gene expression 
863 
and breast cancer risk. Furthermore, we evaluated whether the predicted expression levels of 
864 
 Wu et al. – Page 32 
 
genes within a same genomic region were correlated with each other by using the OncoArray 
865 
data.  
866 
  
867 
INQUISIT algorithm scores for TWAS-identified genes 
868 
To evaluate whether there are additional lines of evidence supporting the identified genes as 
869 
putative target genes of GWAS identified risk SNPs beyond the scope of eQTL, we assessed 
870 
their INQUISIT algorithm scores, which have been described elsewhere7. Briefly, this approach 
871 
evaluates chromatin interactions between distal and proximal regulatory transcription-factor 
872 
binding sites and the promoters at the risk regions using Hi-C data generated in HMECs68 and 
873 
Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired End Tag (ChiA-PET) in MCF7 cells. This could detect 
874 
genome-wide interactions brought about by, or associated with, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), 
875 
DNA polymerase II (POL2), and Estrogen Receptor (ER), all involved in transcriptional 
876 
regulation68. Annotation of predicted target genes used the Integrated Method for Predicting 
877 
Enhancer Targets (IM-PET)69, the Predicting Specific Tissue Interactions of Genes and 
878 
Enhancers (PreSTIGE) algorithm70, Hnisz71 and FANTOM72. Features contributing to the scores 
879 
are based on functionally important genomic annotations such as chromatin interactions, 
880 
transcription factor binding, and eQTLs. The detailed information for the INQUISIT pipeline and 
881 
scoring strategy has been included in a previous publication7. In brief, besides assigning integral 
882 
points according to different features, we also set up-weighting and down-weighting criteria 
883 
according to breast cancer driver genes, topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries, and 
884 
gene expression levels in relevant breast cell lines. Scores in the distal regulation category range 
885 
from 0-7, and in the promoter category from 0-4. A score of "none" represents that no evidence 
886 
was found for regulation of the corresponding gene.  
887

888 
Functional enrichment analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)  
889 
We performed functional enrichment analysis for the identified protein-coding genes reaching 
890 
Bonferroni corrected association threshold. To assess potential functionality of the identified 
891 
lncRNAs, we examined their co-expressed protein-coding genes determined using expression 
892 
data of normal breast tissue of European females in GTEx. Spearman’s correlations between 
893 
protein-coding genes and identified lncRNAs of ≥ 0.4 or ≤ -0.4 were used to indicate a high co-
894 
expression. Canonical pathways, top associated diseases and biofunctions, and top networks 
895 
associated with genes of interest were estimated using IPA software37.  
896 
 
897 
Gene expression in breast cell lines 
898 
Total RNA was isolated from 18 cell lines (Supplementary Table 8) using the RNeasy Mini Kit 
899 
(Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and amplified using the 
900 
Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG cocktail (Invitrogen). Two or three primer pairs 
901 
were used for each gene and the mRNA levels for each sample was measured in technical 
902 
triplicates for each primer set. The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 12. 
903 
Experiments were performed using an ABI ViiA(TM) 7 System (Applied Biosystems), and data 
904 
processing was performed using ABI QuantStudio™ Software V1.1 (Applied Biosystems). The 
905 
average of Ct from all the primer pairs for each gene was used to calculate �C�. The relative 
906 
quantitation of each mRNA normalizing to that in 184A1 was performed using the comparative 
907 
Ct method (��C�) and summarized in Supplementary Figure 4. 
908 
 
909 
Short interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing  
910 
 Wu et al. – Page 34 
 
MCF7 and T47D cells were reverse-transfected with siRNAs targeting genes of interest (GOI) or 
911 
a non-targeting control siRNA (consi; Shanghai Genepharma) with RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) 
912 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Verification of siRNA knockdown of gene expression 
913 
by qPCR was performed 36 hours after transfection.  
914 
 
915 
Proliferation and colony formation assays  
916 
For proliferation assays, MCF7 and T47D cells were trypsinized at 16 hours post-transfection 
917 
and seeded into 24 well plates to achieve ~10% confluency. Phase-contrast images were 
918 
collected with IncuCyte ZOOM (Essen Bioscience) for seven days. Duplicate samples were 
919 
assessed for each GOI siRNA transfected cells along with non-target control si (NTCsi) treated 
920 
cells in the same plate. 184A1 cells were reverse-transfected in 96 well plates to achieve 50% 
921 
confluence at 8 hours after transfection. Two independent experiments were carried out for all 
922 
siRNAs in all three cell lines. Each cell proliferation time-course was normalized to the baseline 
923 
confluency and analyzed in GraphPad Prism. The area under the curve was calculated for each 
924 
concentration (n=4) and used to calculate corrected proliferation (Corrected proliferation % = 
925 
100 +/- (relative proliferation in indicated siRNA - proliferation in NTC siRNA) / knockdown 
926 
efficiency (“+” if the GOI promotes proliferation and “-” if it inhibits proliferation)). For each 
927 
gene, results from two siRNAs in two independent experiments were averaged and summarized 
928 
in Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 6. For colony formation assays; the same number of 
929 
GOI siRNA transfected MCF7 cells was seeded in 6 well plates at 16 hours after transfection to 
930 
assay colony forming efficiency at two weeks. All siRNA-treated cells were seeded in duplicate. 
931 
Colonies (defined to consist of at least 50 cells) were fixed with methanol, stained with crystal 
932 
violet (0.5% w/v), scanned and counted using ImageJ as batch analysis by a self-defined plug-in 
933

935 
results from two siRNAs in two independent experiments were averaged and summarized in
