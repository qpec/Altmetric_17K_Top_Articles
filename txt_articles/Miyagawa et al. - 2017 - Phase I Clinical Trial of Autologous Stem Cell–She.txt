Background-—When transplanted into failing heart, autologous somatic tissue–derived cells yield functional recovery via paracrine
effects that enhance native regeneration. However, the therapeutic effects are modest. We developed a method in which scaffold-
free cell sheets are attached to the epicardial surface to maximize paracrine effects. This Phase I clinical trial tested whether
transplanting autologous cell–sheets derived from skeletal muscle is feasible, safe, and effective for treating severe congestive
heart failure.
Methods and Results-—Fifteen ischemic cardiomyopathy patients and 12 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, who were in New
York Heart Association functional class II or III and had been treated with the maximum medical and/or interventional therapies
available, were enrolled. Scaffold-free cell sheets of 3 to 99108 cells derived from autologous muscle were transplanted over the
LV free wall via left thoracotomy, without additional interventional treatments. There were no procedure-related major
complications during follow-up. The majority of the ischemic cardiomyopathy patients showed marked symptomatic improvement
in New York Heart Association classification (pre: 2.9�0.5 versus 6 months: 2.1�0.4, P<0.01; 1 year: 1.9�0.3, P<0.01) and the
Six-Minute Walk Test with significant reduction of serum brain natriuretic peptide level (pre: 308�72 pg/mL versus 6 months:
191�56 versus 1 year: 182�46, P<0.05), pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary vein
resistance, and left ventricular wall stress after transplantation instead of limited efficacy in dilated cardiomyopathy patients.
Conclusions-—Cell-sheet transplantation as a sole therapy was feasible for treating cardiomyopathy. Promising results in the safety
and functional recovery warrant further clinical follow-up and larger studies to confirm this treatment’s efficacy for severe
congestive heart failure.

H
eart failure, caused primarily by ischemic cardiomyopa-
thy (ICM) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), is life-
threatening
even
with
excellent
treatment.
Dedicated
researchers have sought to combat these serious diseases
with innovative drugs and such therapies as the left ventric-
ular assist device (LVAD) and heart transplantation. However,
these
therapies
have
limited
longevity,
and
heart
transplantation is limited by a shortage of donors. This
situation has led clinicians to consider alternative methods for
treating heart failure.1
We developed a cell-sheet implantation method that can
heal severely damaged myocardium through cytokine para-
crine effects, as evidenced by several experiments using
infarction or DCM models in both large2 and small animals.3

 Cell-sheet implants are reported to offer better functional
recovery than needle-injection methods, mainly by cytokine
paracrine effects4 despite poor cell survival.5,6 Based on these
findings from preclinical work, we previously conducted a
First-in-Man Clinical Trial using cell-sheet implants in a DCM
patient with LVAD, which demonstrated the feasibility of the
treatment with LVAD support.7
In the present study, we introduced cell-sheet implants to
treat cardiomyopathy patients without LVAD in a Phase I
clinical trial to determine the safety, feasibility, and potential
effectiveness of cell-sheet implants as a sole therapy.

Subjects
Twenty-seven patients were enrolled from January 2010 to
February 2015. All patients gave informed, written consent
before being enrolled in the study. Patients with cardiomy-
opathy of ischemic (n=15) and nonischemic (n=12) etiology
were considered eligible if they were 20 to 75 years of age,
had an ejection fraction under 35% and a New York Heart
Association (NYHA) classification of II or more, and had
already received the maximum medical treatment—maximum
b-blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and
angiotensin receptor blocker. The patients with malignancy,
end-stage renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and infectious
disease were excluded. NYHA classification of patients who
receive myoblast sheets was over 2 (average 2.9) and the
majority were stable NYHA class 3.
Eight patients had undergone cardiac resynchronized
therapy and 7 received an implantable cardiac defibrillator.
In the patients with ischemic etiology, 10 patients received
percutaneous coronary intervention and 5 patients underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting more than 4 months before
the cell-sheet treatment. Two patients were receiving contin-
uous catecholamine injections and had been in the hospital
more than 2 months at the time of the cell-sheet implantation
surgery (Table 1). We have not changed medications or reset
the condition of the resynchronization device after myoblast
sheet implantation.

 Culture and Fabrication of Cell Sheets From
Autologous Skeletal Muscle
Muscle specimens (�10 g) were collected from the vastus
medialis. Muscle fibers were collected by removing connec-
tive tissues with collagenase and TrypLE Select (Invitrogen),
and were suspended in skBM medium supplemented with 20%
bovine serum. The cell suspensions were placed in temper-
ature-responsive cell-culture dishes (UpCell, CellSeed), the
surface of which contained temperature-responsive polymer
(poly-N-isopropylacrylamide).
After
the
temperature
is
reduced to 32°C, the surface rapidly becomes hydrated,
prompting the complete detachment of adherent cells as a
cell sheet.8 Cytokines in the supernatant from the cell sheets
were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Implantation of Cell Sheets Onto Heart Tissues
To implant cell sheets, the left fifth intercostal space was
opened with patients under anesthesia, and the pericardium
was opened parallel to the phrenic nerve. While the LV lateral
wall was dissected out, 3- or 4-layer cell sheets were
produced on a clean bench and transferred to the operating
table. The cell sheets were placed and fixed with 7–0 Prolene
onto the LV anterior and lateral wall as widely as possible.
Fibrin was applied to the whole area of the top cell sheet after
the sheets were piled up, so there was no fibrin between the
cell sheets; no fibrin was found on the bottom of the cell-
sheet pile. Also, we added some glue on the top cell sheet
after placement of cells sheets by a stitch to fix the
epicardium of myocardium.
Cine-Multidetector Computed Tomography
Cine-multidetector computed tomography was performed
with
a
64-channel
multidetector
row
scanner
before
surgery, and again 6 months after implanting cell sheets.
Regional end-systolic wall stress was calculated using LV
end-systolic images with Janz’s equation; end-systolic wall
stress=P9ΔAc/ΔAw, where P is LV end-systolic pressure,
and ΔAc and ΔAw are local cross-sectional area of the LV
cavity and local cross-sectional area of the LV wall at end-
systole, respectively. In this study, LV end-systolic pressure
was estimated by the following equation: P=mean blood
pressure �7 mm Hg.9
Follow-Up Examinations
Safety and feasibility
Safety and feasibility were determined based on the occur-
rence of a major cardiac adverse event up to 6 months after
implanting the cell sheets. A major cardiac adverse event was
defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial
infarction, congestive heart failure (freedom from readmission
for heart failure), hospitalization (any cause), infection,
hemothorax, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, cardiovas-
cular event, resuscitated sudden death, and arrhythmia, as
assessed by Holter ECG findings. Arrhythmia included the
following: (1) cardiac arrest, including ventricular fibrillation
and asystole; (2) sustained monomorphic or polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia (VT); (3) nonsustained monomorphic
VT (≥10 beats, ˂30 s) and nonsustained polymorphic VT
(≥10 beats, ˂30 s), including torsade de pointes (≥10 beats
of changing morphology during a run with a long QTc interval);
(4) atrial fibrillation (˃120 beats/minute) with rapid ventric-
ular response, or new-onset atrial fibrillation; (5) nonsustained
supraventricular tachycardia (˃120 beats/minute) or new-
onset sustained supraventricular tachycardia (˃60 s); (6)
third-degree atrioventricular block; (7) nonsustained VT (≥3,
<10 beats); or (8) premature ventricular complex. We evalu-
ated arrhythmias as major cardiac adverse event by criteria
described elsewhere.10
Heart failure event requiring in-hospital treatment
Heart failure event requiring in-hospital treatment was defined
by the Framingham heart failure diagnostic criteria11 and
preoperative admission for heart failure was retrospectively
evaluated by their medical record. The rate of preoperative
heart failure event was calculated by the number of events
and duration from initial heart failure event.
Cardiac death
Cardiac death was defined as event as follows: (1) death
caused by cardiac failure, (2) lethal arrhythmic event, (3)
sudden death by unknown reason; or (4) deterioration of
cardiac function requiring LVAD or depending on continuous
catecholamine injection.
Cardiac echocardiography
An echocardiographic study was performed in all patients
before treatment and 6 months and 1 year after treatment.
We evaluated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left
ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), and left ventric-
ular end-systolic dimension. LVEF was calculated by the
modified Simpson method.
Catheterization
We evaluated pulmonary pressure and pulmonary vascular
pressure by pressure studies using a Swan-Ganz catheter via
the right internal vein. We calculated cardiac output by
thermodilution, and calculated pulmonary vein pressure as

 follows: Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)=(mean PAP-
mean LAP)/CO979.92 (dyne�s�cm�5), where PAP is pul-
monary artery pressure and LAP is left arterial pressure.
Evaluation of symptoms and exercise capacity
Patients were evaluated for exercise capacity before treat-
ment and 6 months after implanting the cell sheets, using the
Six-Minute Walk Test.12 Changes in patients’ symptoms were
evaluated using the NYHA functional classification13 before
treatment and again at 6 months, 1 year after implanting the
cell sheets.
Statistical Analysis
All values are described as the mean�SD unless otherwise
noted and for repeatedly measured data; missing values
were imputed via last observation carried forward methods.
The serial values were evaluated by Wilcoxon signed-rank
test and the P-values were not adjusted for multiple testing,
because this study was conducted to assess safety and
feasibility. For repeatedly measured data, Friedman’s test
was performed separately for the patients with ischemic or
nonischemic etiology to examine the treatment effects
across 3 measurement times (pretreatment, 6 months, and
1 year). Complete-case analyses were also performed as the
sensitivity analysis for the repeatedly measured data. A
value of P<0.05 was considered significant. The difference
scores were also described in all continuous variabilities.
Actuarial estimate of all-cause mortality, cardiac death,
major
cardiac
adverse
event,
and

failure

requiring in-hospital treatment were calculated using the
Kaplan–Meier methods.
Results
Characterization of Implanted Autologous
Skeletal Stem-Cell Sheets
Cell sheets were round, with a thickness of about 100 lm and
an approximate diameter of about 4 cm (Figure 1A). Hema-
toxylin and eosin staining and desmin staining showed
abundant cells of skeletal origin (Figure 1B and 1C). Fig-
ure 1D shows expression of fibronectin indicating construc-
tion and preservation of extracellular matrix. Cell sheets were
implanted to LV free wall through left thoracotomy (Fig-
ure 1E). Hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial
growth factor, and other cytokines were detected in the
supernatant from the skeletal cells (Figure 1F).

 Safety and Feasibility Analysis
All patients showed no procedural-related complication and
were discharged home at 49.6�57.6 days on average. An
unusual long duration of stay was because of the need to
monitor the patients for the occurrence of arrhythmias and had
nothing to do with a complicated postoperative course.
However, 2 patients who received continuous catecholamine
injections preoperatively required long-term hospitalization of
148 and 265 days, respectively. Lethal arrhythmias such as
sustained VT and ventricular fibrillation were not observed in all
patients by Holter ECG. We could not detect nonsustained VT or
sustained VT for 1 month after operation in any patients by 24-
hour ECG monitoring. We have not observed any implantable
cardioverter defibrillator operations to avoid lethal arrhythmias
in any patients for 6 months after the operation. Only 2 patients
with nonischemic etiology developed congestive heart failure
within 6 months after the treatment.
Functional Changes After Cell-Sheet Implantation
In the ischemic etiology, LVEDD decreased from 66.5�15.4% to
64.9�15.7% (P<0.05) and global LVEF increased from
26.74�8.0% to 30.7�10.0% (P<0.01) 1 year after the treat-
ment, as compared with measurements taken before surgery,
and 13 of 15 patients (86.7%) with ischemic etiology showed
improvementofcardiacfunction(Figure 2Aand2B).However,in
nonischemic etiology, LVEDD and LVEF were not statistically
different after the treatment and less than one third of the
patients showed improvement of these parameters (Figure 2C
and 2D). The analyses for the repeated measures of LVEDD and
LVEFalsoshowedthattherewassignificantimprovementinboth
LVEDD and LVEF in the ischemic etiology during 1 year
(Friedman’s v2=8.6 and 10.8, degrees of freedom [df]=2 and 2,
P=0.014 and 0.005, respectively). In contrast, the changes of
LVEDDandLVEFinthenonischemicetiologywerenotsignificant
(Friedman’s v2=0.6 and 0.2, df=2 and 2, P=0.739 and 0.913,
respectively). The results of the P-values in the complete case
analysesforLVEDDandLVEFintheischemicetiology(n=15)and
the nonischemic (n=8) supported the results (P=0.014 and
0.005 in the ischemic etiology and P=0.206 and 0.882 in the
nonischemic, respectively).
Pressure Study
The parameters evaluated by Swan-Ganz catheter were signif-
icantly decreased in the ischemic etiology as follows: mean
pulmonary artery pressure, 26.9�12.2 mm Hg (pretreatment)
versus 20.9�10.2 mm Hg, P<0.05 (6 months after treatment);
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), 17.0�7.1 mm Hg
versus 13.0�7.6 mm Hg,
P<0.05; PVR, 205�131 dynes/
sec�cm5 versus 158�50 dynes/sec�cm5, P<0.05 (Figure 3A
through 3C). However, in the nonischemic etiology, they were
not achieved after the treatment as follows: mean pulmonary
artery pressure, 20.9�8.4 mm Hg (pretreatment) versus
22.2�10.1 mm Hg, P=0.45 (6 months after treatment); PCWP,
14.0�7.0 mm Hg versus 15.5�9.4 mm Hg, P=0.46; PVR,
141�64 dynes/sec�cm5 versus 166�77 dynes/sec�cm5,
P=0.20 (Figure 3D through 3F).
Prior to treatment, pressure studies showed pulmonary
hypertension (PVR more than 150 dyne) in 7 of the patients
with ischemic etiology and in 6 of the patients with nonischemic
etiology. Compared with the pretreatment values, these
parameters had improved even though the patients with
pulmonary hypertension 6 months after treatment in the
patients with ischemic etiology (Figure 3G). In contrast, in the
patients with nonischemic etiology, such patients whose PVR
was more than 150 did not show the same result (Figure 3H).
Evaluation of Symptoms and Exercise Capacity
In Six-Minute Walk Tests conducted 6 months and 1 year
after the cell-sheet implantation, the walking distances in the
patients with ischemic etiology had improved over the
presurgery distances and these improvements were preserved
for a long period (pre: 416�119 m versus 6 months:
475�125 m,
P<0.05
and
versus
1 year:
484�152 m,
P<0.05) and those in the patients with nonischemic etiology
showed no change after the treatment (pre: 413�129 m
versus
6 months:
434�156 m
and
versus
1 year:
441�164 m, P=0.76) (Figure 4A and 4B). The analyses for
the repeated measures of the walking distance also showed
the significance in the ischemic etiology (Friedman’s v2=9.0,
df=2, P=0.011) and nonsignificance in the nonischemic
etiology (Friedman’s v2=0.5, df=2, P=0.761). Sensitivity
analyses with complete cases supported these results.
In the ischemic etiology, the NYHA functional class had
improved in all patients (pre: 2.9�0.7 versus 6 month:
2.1�0.4 P<0.01, 1 year: 1.9�0.3 P<0.01). On the other
hand, in the nonischemic etiology, 3 patients developed heart
failure within 1 year and they were considered as NYHA
functional class IV. However, the NYHA functional class had
also decreased on average, which was not statistically
significant (pre: 2.9�0.5 versus 6 months: 2.6�0.8 P=0.05,
1 year: 2.5�0.9 P=0.20) (Figure 4C and 4D). The repeated-
measurement analyses for NYHA functional class also showed
significance in the ischemic etiology (Friedman’s v2=20.5,
df=2, P<0.001) and nonsignificance in the nonischemic
etiology (Friedman’s v2=3.2, df=2, P=0.202).
Brain Natriuretic Peptide Blood Sampling

the ICM patients after surgery, eventually reaching about half
of the pretreatment levels; the average level before treatment

 End-Systolic Wall Stress Evaluated by
Cine-Multidetector Computed Tomography
Cine-multidetector computed tomography was avoided in 5
patients of 12 patients with nonischemic etiology because of
the following reasons: renal failure in 2 patients and
deterioration of cardiac function in 3 patients. Thus, the
statistical analysis was not performed in nonischemic etiol-
ogy. In the ischemic etiology, global end-systolic wall stress,
which was calculated by average of regional end-systolic wall
stress, was significantly decreased at 6 months after the
treatment (380�70?333�50 kdyn/cm2 P<0.05) (Figure 5).
Survival Rate
We encountered 3 late deaths attributable to gastrointestinal
bleeding, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Survival rate was
96.0% at 1 year and 84.3% at 3 years, and there was no
significant different between their etiologies (ischemic: 100%
at 1 year and 90.9% at 3 years, nonischemic: 90.0% at 1 year
and 75.0% at 3 years, P=0.31 Log rank) (Figure 6A).
Cardiac Death-Free Rate
In the ischemic etiology, there was no cardiac death event;
however, 5 late cardiac deaths occurred in the nonischemic
etiology. Three patients developed cardiac failure and under-
went LVAD implantation (Table 2). Cardiac death-free rate
was 74.1% at 1 year and 74.1% at 2 years in the nonischemic
etiology, which was statistically significant compared with the
ischemic etiology (P<0.05 Log rank test) (Figure 6B).

 Incidence and Rates of Freedom From Heart
Failure Event Requiring In-Hospital Treatment
Incidents of heart failure event was 0.91 event/patients-
years preoperatively and it was significantly decreased to
0.38 event/patients-years
in
the
postoperative
period
(P<0.01).
The rate of freedom from heart failure event was 86.7% for
the first year and 86.7% for the third year in the ischemic
etiology and 65.7% for the first year and 39.4% for the third
year in the nonischemic etiology (Figure 6C), which was not
statistically significant between the etiologies (P=0.16 Log
rank test).
Discussion
We performed this Phase I clinical trial of our autologous
skeletal stem-cell sheet to evaluate its safety and feasibility as
a sole therapy for patients with severe heart failure who had
already received the maximum medical treatment available.
This Phase I clinical trial demonstrated that the implantation
of autologous skeletal stem-cell sheets is feasible for heart-
failure patients. Almost all of the ICM patients improved in
exercise capacity, as determined by the Six-Minute Walk Test,
and symptoms evaluated by NYHA. Reductions in PAP, PVR,
PCWP, and LV wall stress were noted after cell-sheet
implantation in ICM patients. While systolic function did not
dramatically improve after cell-sheet implantation in some
patients, the patients’ symptoms and exercise capacity were
notably recovered compared with their values before surgery.
All the patients with pulmonary hypertension experienced
marked reductions in PAP, PVR, and PCWP, which may have
led to the remarkable recoveries of symptoms and exercise
capacity. In addition to functional and symptomatic improve-
ments, cardiac survival rate and lower freedom from heart
failure events requiring in-hospital treatment after sheet
therapy, which lead to lower medical costs for heart failure,
were satisfactory. Although some DCM patients showed
marked functional and symptomatic recovery, other patients
demonstrated preservation in cardiac function and symptoms
in spite of gradual progress in heart failure. However, this
study without controls and including some patients who may
show functional recovery following coronary artery bypass
graft or percutaneous coronary intervention could not exactly
reveal safety and efficacy of the autologous skeletal stem-cell
sheet therapy, and further study may be needed to elucidate
them.
It is interesting that cell-sheet implantation reduced the
PVR and pulmonary pressure. In severe heart failure, PVR may
progress, by compensating for reduced blood inflow into the
LV to avoid elevation of PCWP. Considering these mecha-
nisms, PCWP may decrease as LV diastolic function improves
after cell-sheet implantation, reducing the compensation and
leading to a reduction in PVR. We speculate that cell-sheets
continuously secrete very small amounts of cytokines,
including hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial
growth factor, and Stromal cell-derived factor-1, which can
reduce pulmonary hypertension over long periods of time.
These cytokines may repair the diseased pulmonary vascula-
ture as they circulate, reducing the PVR or pulmonary
hypertension. We have already reported that implants of
skeletal stem-cell sheets in a right-ventricle heart-failure
model in rats recovered the right-ventricle function through
cytokine paracrine effects.14 Further study is necessary to
confirm the mechanisms that reduce pulmonary hypertension
after cell-sheet implantation. Furthermore, this study revealed
that LV wall stress was remarkably declined after implanta-
tion, which is supposed to attenuate progressive LV fibrosis.
It is important to identify an appropriate first end point
when evaluating therapies for heart failure. Unquestionably,
improved quality of life, better survival rates, or lower medical
costs are excellent surrogate markers of cell-sheet efficacy.
Although many cell-therapy studies have set the LVEF as a
first end point to evaluate the therapy’s effectiveness,15 LVEF
may not be the best indicator, because the LVEF is known to
be easily influenced by LV pre- and afterloads, and it may

 change dramatically depending on volume load. Although
previous clinical cell-therapy studies have shown a 5%
functional recovery in EF,15 we could not find an appropriate
tool to reliably measure a 5% improvement in LVEF.16,17
Recent studies have shown that a survival rate can be
estimated based on several parameters; with this model, the
efficacy of cell therapy could be estimated by comparing the
real and estimated survival rates in a single-arm study.18
However, it should be verified that this survival rate model
mimics the real survival rates for the patients enrolled in a
study. If verified and authorized, this model would be a
powerful tool for evaluating the effectiveness of cell therapies
for patients with severe heart failure and no other available
treatment options. Thus, comprehensive surrogate parame-
ters such as estimated survival rate, quality of life, exercise
tolerance, and lower medical costs for heart failure may be
the best way to evaluate cell-therapy efficacy. In this respect,
here we observed functional recovery, reverse LV remodeling,
probably prolonged survival, improved quality of life, and
increased exercise tolerance in ICM patients included in the
study. Thus, registering a large number of candidates and
using comprehensive surrogate markers may be the best
approach for determining the effectiveness of cell-sheet
therapy in a single-arm study.
In this study, we applied skeletal stem-cell sheet therapy to
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We previously reported
that in DCM-model hamsters, cell-sheet implants preserved
functional performance and attenuated dilation of the LV
chamber compared with the untreated control group. Ham-
sters treated with cell-sheet implants showed antifibrotic
potential in the extracellular matrix, which increased sur-
vival.19 Considering these preclinical results, cell sheets may
prolong the survival rate in human DCM patients by attenu-
ating the LV dilation and deterioration in systolic function,
which are common in DCM patients. However, further study
may be needed to prove these hypotheses in clinical study.
This clinical study clearly suggested that cell-sheet implanta-
tion might have more functional impacts on ICM patients
compared with DCM patients. It has been reported that
regeneration mechanisms in cell sheet mainly depend on
angiogenesis induced by secreted cytokines, so indication of
cell-sheet implantation may be more suitable to ICM patients
compared with DCM patients, considering pathophysiological
aspects. To improve effectiveness, the optimal dose of cells or
extent of the ventricle that should be covered may be
examined experimentally.
A preclinical study reported that the cell-sheet method is
less likely than needle-injection delivery methods to evoke
lethal ventricular arrhythmia.20 Myoblast injection triggered
lethal ventricular arrhythmia in 1 clinical trial.10 Although we
detected symptomless nonsustained VT in 3 patients after
cell-sheet implantation 3 or 6 months after operation, the
arrhythmias were not life-threatening and had been observed
in these patients before surgery. Some studies have reported
that implanted cell sheets cannot survive more than 6 months
after implantation, and that arrhythmias are observed mainly
in early phases after implantation.2 In our present study, all
the patients were monitored by 24-hour ECG for 1 month
after cell-sheet implantation, and we did not detect any lethal
arrhythmias after implantation. Some studies have reported
that 30% of patients with severe heart failure show sustained
VT or nonsustained VT21; the probability of these arrhythmias
may be lower in our present study. We can confirm that cell-
sheet implantation is safe, in terms of not inducing lethal
arrhythmia. These arrhythmogenic differences might depend
on the method of cell delivery, and as evidenced by preclinical
studies20; the cell-sheet method is less likely than needle-
injection methods to damage the myocardium.
This Phase I study found cell-sheet transplantation as a
sole therapy to be a feasible treatment for cardiomyopathy.
The promising results in the safety and functional recovery
seen in this study warrant further clinical follow-up and larger
studies to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of autologous
skeletal stem-cell sheets for severe congestive heart failure.
