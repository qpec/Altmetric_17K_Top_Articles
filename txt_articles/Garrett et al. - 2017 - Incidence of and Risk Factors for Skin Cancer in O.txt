IMPORTANCE Skin cancer is the most common malignancy occurring after organ
transplantation. Although previous research has reported an increased risk of skin cancer in
solid organ transplant recipients (OTRs), no study has estimated the posttransplant
population–based incidence in the United States.
OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence and evaluate the risk factors for posttransplant skin
cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), melanoma (MM), and Merkel cell carcinoma
(MCC) in a cohort of US OTRs receiving a primary organ transplant in 2003 or 2008.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter retrospective cohort study examined
10 649 adult recipients of a primary transplant performed at 26 centers across the United
States in the Transplant Skin Cancer Network during 1 of 2 calendar years (either 2003 or
2008) identified through the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)
database. Recipients of all organs except intestine were included, and the follow-up periods
were 5 and 10 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident skin cancer was determined through detailed
medical record review. Data on predictors were obtained from the OPTN database. The
incidence rates for posttransplant skin cancer overall and for SCC, MM, and MCC were
calculated per 100 000 person-years. Potential risk factors for posttransplant skin cancer
were tested using multivariate Cox regression analysis to yield adjusted hazard ratios (HR).
RESULTS Overall, 10 649 organ transplant recipients (mean [SD] age, 51 [12] years; 3873
women [36%] and 6776 men [64%]) contributed 59 923 years of follow-up. The incidence
rates for posttransplant skin cancer was 1437 per 100 000 person-years. Specific subtype
rates for SCC, MM, and MCC were 812, 75, and 2 per 100 000 person-years, respectively.
Statistically significant risk factors for posttransplant skin cancer included pretransplant skin
cancer (HR, 4.69; 95% CI, 3.26-6.73), male sex (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.34-1.81), white race (HR,
9.04; 95% CI, 6.20-13.18), age at transplant 50 years or older (HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 2.20-3.48),
and being transplanted in 2008 vs 2003 (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22-1.94).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Posttransplant skin cancer is common, with elevated risk
imparted by increased age, white race, male sex, and thoracic organ transplantation.
A temporal cohort effect was present. Understanding the risk factors and trends in
posttransplant skin cancer is fundamental to targeted screening and prevention in this
population.

T
he number of solid organ transplants performed in the
United States is increasing. In 1988, 12 623 transplants
were carried out nationwide; by 2015 this number has
increased nearly 3-fold to 30 969.1 The lifelong immunosup-
pressive regimes required to preserve graft function place or-
gan transplant recipients (OTRs) at increased risk of skin can-
cer, the most common tumor in this population.2-4 The risk of
skin cancer is higher in OTRs than in the general population,
65-fold for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and
3-fold for malignant melanoma (MM).3-6 A number of risk fac-
tors for posttransplant skin cancer have been identified in
single-center studies: being male,7,8 white,9-11 50 years or older
at the time of transplant,6,7,12 a recipient of a thoracic organ,5,13
and having a longer time elapsed since transplant.13 A history
of pretransplant treated skin cancer,14,15 as well as past over-
exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation16-18 are also believed to
increase the risk of posttransplant skin cancer.

Methods
Transplant Skin Cancer Network
The Transplant Skin Cancer Network (TSCN) is led by the Uni-
versity of California, San Francisco, and includes 26 US trans-
plant centers with an active collaboration between the der-
matology and transplant services (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Participation in the TSCN was open to all transplant centers
in the United States; 26 centers elected to participate in this
network study based on access to registry and medical rec-
ordsandethicsapprovalforamulticenterstudy.Thestudywas
approved by the Committee on Human Research at the Uni-
versity of California, San Francisco, as well as at each partici-
pating center.
Study Population
Adult (≥18 years) recipients of a primary transplant per-
formedatparticipatingtransplantcenterseitherbetweenJanu-
ary1throughDecember31,2003,orbetweenJanuary1through
December 31, 2008, were eligible for inclusion. The 2 years
studied were selected to enable a 5-year and 10-year fol-
low-up period to investigate differences in transplant cohorts
between 2003 and 2008 and to capture changes in immuno-
suppressant regimes introduced between the 2 time periods,
as well as other temporal trends. Transplanted organs in-
cluded the lung, heart (either organ or heart-lung, referred to
here as “thoracic” transplants), pancreas, liver, and kidney; in-
testinal transplants were excluded given the small number
(n = 36) and limited centers.
Eligible subjects were identified using the Standard Trans-
plant Analysis and Research (STAR) file, based on Organ Pro-
curement Transplant Network (OPTN) data as of December
2013. The OPTN database contains pretransplant and post-
transplant data on every transplant event occurring in the
United States since 1987; data are reported to the OPTN by
transplant centers. Using the OPTN database, the demograph-
ics of our 26-center cohort were compared to those of all US
recipients transplanted in either 2003 or 2008.

on previous research showing an effect on posttransplant skin
cancer. MapQuest Open geocoding software (MapQuest Inc)
was used to convert the zip code at the time of transplant into
latitude coordinates, which were used as a proxy for pretrans-
plant UV exposure.28,29
Statistical Analysis
The incidence rate (IR) of skin cancer, SCC, MM, and MCC was
calculated per 100 000 person-years of observation. Patients
were followed from the date of transplant until the earliest of
skin cancer, death, or last follow-up. If the date of diagnosis
was not known (n = 120), the date of last follow-up, obtained
from the medical record (n = 117) or from the STAR file (n = 3),
was used. Cox regression analysis was used to test the asso-
ciations between the independent predictor variables of in-
terest on time until posttransplant skin cancer. Hazard ratios
(HR) and 95% CIs were adjusted for all predictors. Binary tests
of interaction were performed, and the proportionality of haz-
ards assumption was tested using the Schoenfeld test. To ac-
knowledge clustering effects by transplant center, a shared
frailty model with γ-distributed frailties was used in the Cox
regression analysis (equivalent to a mixed model where the
transplant center is a random effects variable).30 The skin can-
cer–specific HR was calculated in the presence of competing
risk, defined as death from all causes, using the Fine and Gray
proportional subhazard method.31 Competing risk regression
yielded similar HRs as those obtained with Cox regression.
To investigate differences in transplant cohorts (trans-
plant year 2003 vs 2008) and other temporal trends, all
analyses were conducted for the overall cohort and strati-
fied by transplant year 2003 vs 2008 (eTables 2-4 in the
Supplement).
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for
missingdata.Datamissingmorethan10%ofobservationswere
the outcomes of SCC (36%), MM (36%), MCC (37%), and pre-
dictor of pretransplant skin cancer (39%) (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).Onlogisticregressionanalysis,thoracicOTRsand
patients transplanted in southern latitudes were more likely
to be missing outcomes. First, inverse probability weighting
(ie, weighting on the inverse of the probability of not missing
the outcome) was used to account for missing data.32 A logis-
tic regression model for missing outcomes was developed, and
the analysis was run adjusting for missing data through the
weighting scheme. To acknowledge clustering effects by trans-
plant center, the Huber/White method of cluster-robust stan-
dard error was applied to the Cox regression analysis.33 In a
second sensitivity analysis, chained equations multiple im-
putation(MI)wasperformed.34Twentyimputeddatasetswere
created, and all missing outcomes and predictor were in-
cluded. This strategy was limited by a significant overlap be-
tween the patients missing the outcomes and those missing
the predictor. To address differential missingness of data be-
tween the participating centers, a third sensitivity analysis ex-
cluding centers with more than 20% of missing outcome data
was performed. The final model was robust to the above sen-
sitivity analyses; any differences in the results are noted in the
results section.
Results
Study Population
A total of 10 649 adult subjects received a primary transplant in
2003(n = 5004)or2008(n = 5645),contributing59923person-
yearsoffollow-up.Themedian(interquartilerange[IQR])follow-
upwas6(3-8)years;10yearsinthosetransplantedin2003(IQR,
3-11),and6yearsinthosetransplantedin2008(IQR,3-7).Atthe
endoffollow-up,6729(63%)patientswerealive,2773(26%)were
deceased, and 1147 (11%) were lost to follow-up.
Cohort demographics are summarized in Table 1, along
with the national demographics of OTRs transplanted in 2003
or 2008. Compared to all OTRs who received a primary trans-
plant in the United States in 2003 or 2008, our study group
was older, had a higher proportion of white patients, and had
undergone thoracic OTRs (P < .001).
Skin Cancer Incidence
A total of 861 patients (8%) developed posttransplant skin can-
cer, yielding an IR of 1437 per 100 000 person-years (Table 2).
The stratum-specific IR was highest for thoracic transplant re-
cipients (2426 per 100 000 person-years), whites (2039 per
100 000 person-years), patients 50 years or older at trans-
plant (2032 per 100 000 person-years), men (1718 per 100 000
person-years), and those transplanted in 2008 vs 2003 (1651
per 100 000 person-years). Analysis of the renal transplant
group specifically demonstrated that the stratum-specific IR
for this subgroup was 1280 per 100 000 person-years. The cu-
mulative incidence of skin cancer–free survival was lower for
those transplanted in 2008 vs 2003, as shown in the Kaplan-
Meier plots in the Figure (log rank P < .001) (eTable 2 in the
Supplement presents the IR of skin cancer stratified by covar-
iates for years of transplant 2003 and 2008). The majority
(n = 812 [94%]) of skin cancers were SCC, yielding an IR of 1355
per 100 000 person-years (Table 3). The incidence of post-
transplantMM(n = 75)was125per100 000person-years.Only
2 cases of posttransplant MCC were documented.
Predictors of Posttransplant Skin Cancer
Several predictors of skin cancer were identified (Table 4). The
adjusted HR for overall skin cancer was 4.69 (95% CI, 3.61-
6.09) in association with a history of previous pretransplant
skin cancer (P < .001), 1.61 (95% CI, 1.34-1.89) for male sex
(P < .001), 1.51 (95% CI, 1.26-1.82) for thoracic organ transplan-
tation (P < .001), 7.79 (95% CI, 5.34-11.37) for white race
(P < .001), 2.65 (95% CI, 2.12-3.21) for patients 50 years or older
at transplant (P < .001), and 1.59 (95% CI, 1.33-1.91) for being
transplanted in 2008 vs 2003 (P < .001). Latitude was not sta-
tistically associated with skin cancer risk (HR, 1.01 [95% CI,
0.99-1.02] per degree latitude; P = .97).
The adjusted HR for SCC and MM were similar to those for
overall skin cancer (Table 4), falling short of statistical signifi-
cance in MM due to the small number of events. A positive his-
tory of pretransplant MM had a higher HR (7.15 [95% CI, 3.31-
15.46];P < .001)comparedwiththatobservedforSCCoroverall
skincancer(HR,4.71[95%CI,3.60-6.16]and4.69[95%CI,3.61-
6.09], respectively; P < .001).

Discussion
Incidence and Predictors of Skin Cancer in OTRs
This study provides a national patient population estimate for
posttransplant skin cancer incidence in the United States. The
IR of overall skin cancer was high at 1437 per 100 000 person-
years. Most cancers were SCC, which had the highest IR at 1355
per100 000person-years.Bycomparison,theUSgeneraladult

in nonwhites; for men, patients 50 years or older at trans-
plant, and thoracic OTR, the IRs were 1.7-fold to 3-fold higher
than for women, patients younger than 50 years at trans-
plant, or abdominal OTRs, respectively.
Effect of Era of Transplantation on Skin Cancer
Patients transplanted in 2008 vs 2003 had a higher IR of skin
cancer(1651vs1272per100 000person-years)(Table2)(eTable
2 in the Supplement). We postulated that this might be due to
improved documentation of skin cancer history in the more
recent era (2008), but the difference persisted when the fol-
low-up time was limited to 2009 and beyond (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). We also postulated that the difference might be
due to improved overall survival in the more recent era due
to newer immunosuppressive agents, but the increase re-
flects adjustment for death as a competing risk. We postulate
that the difference may be due to more aggressive immediate
posttransplantimmunosuppressioninthemorerecentera.The
riskmodelstratifiedbytransplantyearwasnotdifferenttothat
of the overall cohort, so this temporal trend is not working
through any of the risk factors (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Effect of Pretransplant UV Exposure on Skin Cancer
WeusedlatitudeofresidenceasproxyforpriorUVexposureand
hypothesized that subjects living in southern latitudes have a
higher incidence of posttransplant skin cancer.28,29,39 The HRs
for other factors remained unchanged when latitude was re-
movedfromthemodel,andHRsremainedunchangedinamodel

eralpossibleexplanationsfortheabsenceofaneffectoflatitude

exposure in the general population,40-42 it may not be a good
measureofpretransplantUVexposureinOTRs.Also,latitudeco-
ordinates were obtained by geocoding the patient’
s zip code at

exposure43,44;surveydataonprevioussunburnmaybeabetter

causality may not hold true in OTRs. Research using latitude,
AVeragedailytotalGLObalsolarradiation(AVGLO)exposure,and
patient-based reports of prior sun exposure history points to a
role for UV radiation in skin cancer incidence, but more reliable
biomarkers of UV radiation may be needed to substantiate this
hypothesis.
Predictors of SCC and MM
The magnitude and significance of the predictors in the model
for overall skin cancer was driven by SCC. The model for MM
had similar point estimates for the predictors, with wider CIs
reflecting a smaller number of observed cases. The effect of
pretransplant MM on posttransplant MM risk was larger than
that observed for SCC (HR, 7.15; P < .001 vs HR, 4.71; P < .001).
Arron et al47 observed a similar effect size in a cohort of 185 039
OTRs in the United States where the HR for incident MM in pa-
tients with pretransplant MM was 5.4 (P < .001).47
Limitations
The main limitation of this study was the imperfect capture of
outcome data. The primary reason for missing skin cancer data

wasthefailuretohaveadermatologichistorynotedinthemedi-
cal record. This may occur if patients were followed by derma-
tologists in the community and did not report their skin can-
cers to the transplant team. This limitation was addressed by
comparingtheresultsofseveralsensitivityanalysesusingmeth-
ods to address missing data as previously noted. To account for
variance between the 26 participating transplant centers, we
incorporated a shared frailty model into the Cox regression to
account for random effects due to transplant center.
As medical record documentation is the gold standard for
skincancermalignancyreporting,thisstudyhighlightstheneed
for better documentation of skin cancer history. Posttrans-
plant skin cancer can be reported to OPTN via malignancy re-
porting forms, but dermatologists may not be aware that the
transplant team is able to register these tumors with OPTN. Fu-
tureanalysisofthisdatasetwillinvestigatethevalidityofOPTN
posttransplant malignancy reporting for skin cancer.
Further,thesamplewasbiasedtowardpatientsseeninaca-
demictransplantcenterswithadermatologydepartment.When
comparing the TSCN cohort with all US patients transplanted
in 2003 and 2008, there was a small but statistically signifi-
cant increase in the proportion of subjects who were older,
white, and a recipient of a thoracic transplant. Because these
are known risk factors for posttransplant skin cancer, it is pos-
siblethatourIRestimateisintheupperboundsofthetruepopu-
lation value. Balanced against the potential for under-capture
of skin cancer outcomes, we anticipate that these data achieve
reasonable accuracy.
Prior research has demonstrated that specific immuno-
suppressive agents such as azathioprine confer increased risk
for skin cancer in OTRs. Data on the duration and dosage of
medication exposure required to inform this type of pharma-
cologic study was not available to this cohort since it is not in-
cluded in the OTPN database. The utility of the data pre-
sented is to inform risk prediction at the time of transplant,
before posttransplant drug exposures. Future research is
needed to determine whether skin cancer risk can be miti-
gated through optimization of immunosuppressive regimes.
Conclusions
Thehighincidenceofposttransplantskincancerhighlightsthe
need for tumor surveillance after organ transplantation, es-
pecially in patients with high-risk features. These data can be
used to inform risk stratification and screening guidelines for
skin cancer in OTRs. To our knowledge, Germany executed the
first nationwide skin cancer screening program for the gen-
eral population in 2008; its effectiveness in reducing the mor-
tality and morbidity of skin cancer is under evaluation.45,46,48
A follow-up goal of this study is to develop a prediction tool
for posttransplant skin cancer.

NOTABLE NOTES
Early Reports of “Sycosis”
Niki Papavramidou, PhD; Anthony Karpouzis, PhD
Sycosisisamedicaltermthatcreatesconfusionintheancienttexts.The
termisusedforboththedescriptionofaskindiseaseandfortrachoma.
This Notable Note aims at shedding light on the skin disease defined as
sycosis, after the Greek term for “fig”(σύκο)—since its appearance re-
sembles the inner part of the fruit—and presenting the descriptions of
ancient authors.
According to Galen (AD 2nd century ), Archigenes (AD 1st century)
defined sycosis as exanthemata of the beard, also called mentagra
(μανταγρες), or wild lichen, while Heraclides of Tarentum (2nd century
BC) described sycosis of the head and beard as having the form of pro-
truding ulcers.1 Galen himself described sycosis as small, hard ulcers
appearing on the beard that are composed partly of thick and partly of
thin serous humor and ulcerating rapidly if not treated with highly dry-
ing medicaments.1 Celsus (AD 1st century) described sycosis as an
ulceration of 2 types, both appearing in areas covered by hair: (1) indu-
rated and circular ulceration and (2) moist ulceration with an irregular
outline. In the first type, which appears mostly on the beard, there is a
scanty and glutinous discharge, while in the second type, which
appears mainly on the scalp, the discharge is abundant and
malodorous.2 Pliny the Elder (AD 1st century) wrote of an affliction
called mentagra in Latin, or lichen in Greek, that affected mainly the
upper-class citizens and was dispersed through kissing. Aetius of
Amida (AD 5-6th century), Paulus Aegineta (AD 7th century), and Pau-
lus Nicaaensis (circa AD 7th-10th centuries) described as sycosis either
infections of the eyelids or “ulcerous excrescences which are round,
somewhat hard, red, and accompanied with pain”arising mostly on
the head but also on other parts of the body.3
From a modern point of view, sycosis is defined as an edematous
growth in form of a fig, usually concerning folliculitis involving the cu-
