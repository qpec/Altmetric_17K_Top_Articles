Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis com-
plex (MTBC), a wildly successful group of organisms and the leading
cause of death resulting from a single bacterial pathogen world-
wide. It is generally accepted that MTBC established itself in human
populations in Africa and that animal-infecting strains diverged from
human strains. However, the precise causal factors of TB emergence
remain unknown. Here, we propose that the advent of controlled
fire use in early humans created the ideal conditions for the emer-
gence of TB as a transmissible disease. This hypothesis is supported
by mathematical modeling together with a synthesis of evidence
from epidemiology, evolutionary genetics, and paleoanthropology.

uman pathogen surveys (1, 2) have revealed trends in the
emergence of novel human infectious diseases; among the
identified drivers, an overarching theme is change. For instance,
altered human–environment interactions, changes to subsistence
practices and social adaptations, diversity in human population
health, and microbial adaptation have all been linked to instances
of novel infections (3–7). Understanding the timing and context of
emergence is therefore critical to identifying the origins of human
infectious diseases.
A range of transitions in human ecological history have coincided
with major changes to patterns of infectious disease in human
populations (4–7). The beginnings of agriculture and livestock hus-
bandry, or the Neolithic period, from around 10,000 y ago led to
dramatic changes in human–pathogen interactions (4–7). Humans
share almost 150 enzootic pathogens with domesticated animals, all
of which, except dogs, were domesticated during the Neolithic (7).
The subsequent rise of dense and sedentary populations supported
by agriculture, extensive ecological disruptions, and high contact
rates with domesticated animals and wild pest species such as rodents
are thought to have provided new opportunities for pathogens to
cross species boundaries and to have supported more virulent
“crowd” infections such as measles and smallpox (3–7). Although
the Neolithic period was probably not the first ecological tran-
sition with consequences for human–pathogen coevolution (4),
it is widely regarded to have been the most wide-reaching ep-
idemiological transition in human history (4–7).
However, another more ancient cultural shift might have af-
fected human evolution even more dramatically: the advent of the
controlled use of fire. Early hominins might have used fire in an ad
hoc manner by at least 1.0 million years ago (8), but the controlled
use of fire arose more recently, perhaps only 300,000–400,000 y
ago (9). Since Darwin’s time (10), fire has been viewed as one of
the most important human cultural innovations. Today, it is rec-
ognized as a preeminent example of cultural niche construction
whereby humans, through their use of fire, altered their selective
environment and the conditions of their own evolution (9, 11).
Besides providing warmth and light, fire would have extended
the breadth and quality of foods consumed by early humans and
supported geographic range expansions. Fire would have allowed
large-scale manipulation of the environment through burning of
vegetation, improved food storage, and advanced techniques of
tool manufacture (12–14). Fire would also have aided defense
against predators—from microorganisms through to mammals—
and in the control of pest species including insects (14). These effects
likely had far-reaching implications for early humans, including
changes to activity patterns (12–15), social organization (15, 16),
reproductive behavior (15), cognitive evolution (15), and perhaps
even life history (12–15). We suggest that the controlled use of fire
also had a major effect on human host–pathogen relationships, not
just in sterilizing food (12), but also in unexpected ways relating to
cultural changes triggered by fire use and physiological effects ex-
perienced by early humans exposed to campfire smoke. We hy-
pothesize that these changes, caused by controlled fire use,
precipitated the emergence of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex (MTBC), the causative agent of the new infectious disease:
tuberculosis (TB). This hypothetical process of TB emergence is
represented schematically in Fig. 1.
Results
To evaluate our hypothesis, we first review a range of evidence from
evolutionary genetics, epidemiology, and paleoanthropology to reveal
the current state of knowledge on the emergence of TB in early hu-
man populations and the possibility of a link between this emergence
and the advent of the controlled use of fire. In light of this synthesis of
evidence, we then consider quantitatively the rise in the risk of the
evolutionary emergence of TB attributable to controlled fire use.
The Evolutionary Origins of TB. The age of the association between
humans and MTBC remains controversial: some studies estimate
the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of MTCB existed less
than 6,000 y ago (17–19), whereas others have obtained a figure of
around 70,000 y ago (20–22). Regardless of which estimate is more
Significance
Tuberculosis is an ancient human disease that continues to affect
millions of people worldwide. A crucial component of the origins
of the tuberculosis bacterium remains a mystery: What were the
conditions that precipitated its emergence as an obligate trans-
missible human pathogen? Here, we identify a connection be-
tween the emergence of tuberculosis and another major event in
human prehistory, namely the discovery of controlled fire use.
Our results have serious and cautionary implications for the
emergence of new infectious diseases—feedback between cul-
tural innovation and alteration of living conditions can catalyze
unexpected changes with potentially devastating consequences
lasting thousands of years.

EVOLUTION
 accurate, TB is likely to be older in humans than these inferred
ages. These coalescent estimates are based on extant lineages and
do not necessarily provide the age of the first strain to infect hu-
mans; selective sweeps, population bottlenecks, and simply genetic
drift can all make the MRCA younger than the origin of a species
(23). It is unlikely, however, that TB was a transmissible disease
before the separation of the human lineage from other apes. Al-
though other mammals, including chimpanzees, can be infected
with TB, there is no evidence of any cospeciation between non-
human primates and mycobacteria (24).
The archaeological and molecular evidence taken together favors
an early emergence of MTBC originating in Africa and a long-term
association with modern humans on this continent. For instance, all
strains adapted to animal hosts are derived from human strains (23),
ruling out the possibility that TB was first a bovine disease which
crossed over to humans during the Neolithic period. Whole-genome
draft sequencing has identified deep lineages in Africa that are ex-
cellent candidates for representing the original ecotype of the
MTBC (25) and African lineages show high diversity compared with
other regions (26). Cases of MTBC in pre-Columbian human re-
mains from Peru (27) and Chile (28) and in a 17,500 y old Bison
bone discovered in the United States (29) further suggest that MTBC
is ancient and crossed the Bering Strait during the Late Pleistocene.
Contrasting evidence from MTBC genomes isolated from Peruvian
human remains suggests that sea mammals were a source of TB in
the Americas (18), although this evidence does not preclude the
possibility of preexisting MTBC strains. Further support for ancient
origins of TB is found in the form of characteristic lesions on Pa-
leolithic human remains (30) and from ancient DNA isolates (31).
Nontuberculous mycobacteria are ubiquitous in the environment
and account for the majority of species within the genus Myco-
bacterium (32). Such organisms can infect humans opportunistically,
particularly in immunocompromised individuals and patients with
inflammatory lung diseases (33, 34). For instance, Mycobacterium
abscessus is a major respiratory pathogen in patients with cystic fi-
brosis who have profoundly impaired local immune protective
mechanisms (35). Although they are not generally thought to es-
tablish person-to-person chains of transmission, clusters of closely
related strains of M. abscessus have been isolated from patients with
cystic fibrosis, suggesting such transmission can occur, although the
mechanism may be indirect (34, 36).
Comparative analysis indicates that MTBC diverged from a re-
lated nontuberculous mycobacterial species before arising as a clonal
expansion from a generalist ancestral mycobacterial population
shared by the smooth tubercle bacilli Mycobacterium canettii (37, 38).
This ancestor of MTBC, which might have resembled Mycobacte-
rium kansasii (38), presumably lived in the environment and caused
sporadic disease before it acquired the ability to transmit between
hosts (22, 38). Patients infected with M. kansasii present very simi-
larly to TB and respond to antituberculous antibiotics (39), although
M. kansasii is not transmissible in humans and has significantly re-
duced in vivo fitness (38).
Conditions for Evolutionary Emergence. For an environmental spe-
cies to become an endemic human pathogen, the species must
undergo a series of evolutionary transformations (5, 6). Exposure
of a host to a microbe requires sufficient overlap of their habitats.
Evolutionary transformations then allow more complex interac-
tions to arise where the potential pathogen becomes capable of
infecting humans and then of transmitting between hosts. Endemic
persistence, however, requires the basic reproduction number R0 in
human populations (the expected number of secondary cases pro-
duced by a typical case in a completely susceptible host population)
to be greater than unity. The emergence of transmissible TB,
therefore, would have been a rare and unlucky event in which an
opportunistic and poorly transmitting environmental Mycobac-
terium evolved the ability to transmit over short chains of in-
fection until its R0 reached the critical value of unity (40).
Today, MTBC causes mostly latent infection in human hosts,
although a small fraction of these latent infections reactivate to the
disease state before the hosts die (41). It is not known whether the
MTBC precursor also caused latent infection or whether latency
evolved subsequent to its emergence (42). Either way, for TB to
emerge as a transmissible disease, its etiological agent had to
overcome the obstacle of a low R0. The occurrence of any of the risk
factors for infectious disease emergence (see Introduction) brought
about by a transition in human culture or behavior would have fa-
cilitated this process (5, 6). Such a transition would necessarily have
occurred well before the existence of the MRCA of MTBC and
affected the rate of pathogen exposure or the extent of human
susceptibility to infection. The transition might also have provided
novel opportunities for between-host transmission events and/or
supported within-host adaptation of the pathogen (40). The pre-
historic transition of controlling fire, we argue, satisfies these criteria
for influencing the emergence of MTBC in human populations.
Cultural Impact of Fire Use. The earliest convincing evidence for
human control of fire predates both estimates for the MRCA of
MTBC (21), as well as the oldest molecular dates (43), and fossil
remains for anatomically modern humans (44) by considerable
margins. The current consensus is that fire was first made by Homo
heidelbergensis (8), a species widely regarded to be the last common
ancestor of the Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans
(45). The regular use of fire would have constructed a new cultural
niche for hominins with potentially profound implications for the
evolution of H. heidelbergensis and, ultimately, anatomically mod-
ern humans through genetic and ecological inheritance (12–15, 46).
One important change experienced by these early fire-makers
that, we argue, influenced the sporadic transmission of and sus-
ceptibility to pulmonary mycobacterial infection, would have been
the addition of new contexts for human social interactions. For
instance, fire would have provided light to allow social and sub-
sistence activities to occur beyond daylight hours and food being
brought to a central site for cooking and preservation, and fire
maintenance would all have increased interactions and physical
contacts among individuals (16, 47). Early humans in these new
contexts would necessarily have had greatly increased inhalation of
smoke from fires used for these purposes but also by fires used to
repel insects and other pests and possibly even for communication
(48). Indeed, the presence of small microcharcoal fragments
in 300,000- to 400,000-y-old dental calculus samples taken from
Fig. 1.
A scenario for the evolutionary emergence of MTBC in humans. The
open circles indicate sporadic mycobacterial infections from an environment
source, whereas the filled circles indicate new infections attributable to
transmission between individual hosts. Direct transmission of mycobacterial
infection was presumably rare in ancient populations until ideal conditions
appeared for the evolutionary emergence of MTBC. We hypothesize that the
controlled use of fire in early humans precipitated the emergence of tuber-
culosis as a transmissible disease. The time axis is not to scale.

 human remains at Qesem Cave is suggestive of accidental smoke
inhalation from hearth fires (49).
Although fire must also have been used at open-air sites, most
Pleistocene evidence for controlled fire use from the archaeolog-
ical record derives from caves (8, 9). The biased record of fire use
results, in large part, from geological and taphonomic factors, with
cave sediments being more conducive to the preservation of
charcoal, ash, and burnt bone. Temporary shelters were also built
by hunter–gatherers across the globe and were undoubtedly one of
the keys to the successful occupation of wide-ranging environments
by modern humans. Sheltered spaces such as caves and built
structures are inherently social spaces (16, 47), and camp fires act
as a natural focal point for social gatherings (11). Therefore, early
fire makers occupying poorly ventilated spaces were likely to have
been especially vulnerable to inhalation of smoke from fires.
Physiological Impact of Fire Use. A large proportion of biomass smoke
constituents are in the inhalable size range (e.g., carbon monoxide,
aldehydes, nitric oxide, and particulate matter), and many of these
constituents incite chronic inflammatory and destructive changes in
the respiratory system (50). Early hunter–gatherer communities
burning biomass fuels in poorly ventilated spaces were, there-
fore, vulnerable to a wide range of unprecedented adverse health
effects (51).
Metaanalysis has revealed positive associations between smoking
tobacco and domestic use of biomass fuels with increased risk of
MTBC infection and TB disease (52). Possible mechanisms sug-
gested for these associations include the impairment of respiratory
defenses against mycobacteria, because even a brief exposure of
animals to wood smoke can alter bacterial clearance and macro-
phage-mediated local immunity (53). This association is likely to be
attributable to the critical role played by the local immune response
(both innate and adaptive) in protective immunity against MTBC
infection, much more so than humoral adaptive immunity (54). The
process of developing protective immunity against MTBC infection
is largely coordinated within the lungs and lymphatics through, for
instance, the mucociliary escalator and macrophage function, pro-
cesses that may be particularly impaired by smoke exposure and in
patients with inflammatory lung diseases (53–55).
Several respiratory diseases associated with tissue destruction
and impaired local immunity are also well-established to be asso-
ciated with TB and other mycobacterial infections (56–60). The
best characterized of these conditions include chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and silicosis, whereas
the association between nontuberculous mycobacterial disease and
cystic fibrosis is discussed above in The Evolutionary Origins of TB.
The high risk of TB and other mycobacterial infections in patients
with COPD is particularly well characterized because of the high
prevalence of smoking in modern societies (56, 57), although in-
door biomass burning remains a major causative factor globally
(52, 61, 62). Bronchiectasis is another obstructive lung disease that
is significantly more common in populations exposed to wood
smoke (63) and is similarly associated with an increased risk of
mycobacterial infection (58). Meanwhile, mycobacterial infection is
also a risk factor for the development and progression of these
diseases (64), indicating that there is likely to be a feedback
mechanism supporting the persistence of all three conditions
in humans.
The pathogenesis of smoke exposure is closely related to that of
silicosis, which is caused by the inhalation of silica particles that
damage alveolar macrophages and cause inflammation and fibro-
genesis (65). Individuals exposed to aerosolized silica, even without
silicosis, have a dramatically increased risk of mycobacterial
infection (59). The individual-level relative risk for silicosis and
silica-associated TB also persists after exposure has ceased and
is dose-dependent (60, 66). Although biomass burning is not
predominantly silica exposure, these principles may apply to
other inorganic inhaled particles.
Model of TB Emergence. To test the logic in our hypothesis that the
advent of the controlled use of fire could have significantly affected
the probability of TB emergence, we considered quantitatively the
rise in the risk of the evolutionary emergence of TB attributable to
the use of fire. We developed a mathematical model, building on
existing theory of the evolutionary emergence of pathogens (40), to
ask how the ancestor of MTBC could evolve such that its basic
reproductive number R0 reached unity. The model assumes that R0
can increase because of two mechanisms: (i) by adaptive evolution
during chains of transmission and (ii) by the effects of habitual fire
use, namely increased host-susceptibility attributable to biomass
smoke-induced lung damage and greater between-host transmission
opportunities brought about by a developing human social culture.
The model also assumes that host-susceptibility remains otherwise
unchanged through time (this assumption is relaxed in an extended
model presented in SI Appendix) and allows slow exponential
growth of early human populations before expansion out of Africa
(67), although the effect of this assumption on the results was minor.
We calculated the cumulative probability over time of TB
emergence as an endemic human pathogen. This quantity in-
creases with time and the rate of infections attributable to host
exposure to MTBC’s ancestral natural reservoir. The cumulative
probability also depends on the probability that a chain of
transmission evolves an R0 greater than unity, and the probability
that an evolved pathogen does not undergo stochastic extinction.
Under our model, controlled fire use increased the cumulative
probability that TB emerged by several orders of magnitude
compared with the case where TB emerges without fire (Fig. 2).
This result holds when we consider the cumulative probability of
TB emerging up to and including both estimates for the time since
the MRCA of MTBC of 70,000 y ago (Fig. 2) and 6,000 y ago (SI
Appendix, Fig. S2) and is robust to variation in model parameters
including the number of mutations required for the ancestor of
MTBC to evolve an R0 greater than unity from the characteristic
R0 of the natural reservoir (Fig. 3). As the number of mutations
required for R0 to exceed unity increases, so too does the influence
controlled fire use has on the probability of emergence, whereas
the cumulative probability quickly decreases with and without fire
use. Nevertheless, it is likely that only a few mutations were needed
before TB could emerge, because as few as three mutations can
significantly attenuate the virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
in human cells (68) and recombination at one locus can increase
the virulence of M. canettii in cellular and animal infection models
(69). Although unrelated to mycobacteria, it is also noteworthy that
five mutations are required for avian influenza to acquire the
ability of airborne transmission in ferrets (70).
Discussion
Here, we have argued that the extensive changes to human ecology
and unprecedented physiological consequences brought about by
the controlled use of fire in the Pleistocene created ideal conditions
for the emergence of TB. It is possible that during this period of
significant ecological and social change, range extensions leading to
the consumption of novel food sources and altered energy re-
quirements increased exposure of early humans to the natural
reservoir of ancestral MTBC, likely the soil. This increased expo-
sure brought about an increasing number of infections and stut-
tering transmission chains, both of which provided new opportunities
for within-host adaptive evolution. Coupled with increasing host-
susceptibility to mycobacterial infection attributable to biomass
smoke-induced lung damage and the increased opportunities
for transmission brought about by the developing social culture
that fire use encouraged, we hypothesize that the MTBC precursor
evolved an R0 greater than unity relatively quickly, almost guaran-
teeing MTBC’s emergence as a specialized human pathogen.
An alternative hypothesis is that the emergence of MTBC pre-
dates hominins and MTBC infection spanned the species divide.
However, this hypothesis is unlikely to be true because there is no

EVOLUTION
 evidence for coevolution of MTBC and humans before ∼70,000 y
ago (21). Another alternative is that MTBC is the result of an an-
cient zoonotic transfer from wildlife to early humans. Although this
hypothesis cannot be ruled out, comparative genomic analyses
suggest that all known strains that cause TB in animals diverged
from major human strains (23). Therefore, such a hypothetical
ancient nonhuman host is either extinct or remains to be identified.
Furthermore, close, regular contacts with an infected host would be
required to cause zoonosis (71), which is unlikely before humans
began herding and farming. Nevertheless, our model results suggest
that a species jump to humans was much more likely following the
advent of the controlled use of fire. It is also possible that MTBC
emerged in the Pleistocene without any influence of fire use. If so,
this emergence was an extremely unlucky event for early humans in
the absence of compounding factors magnifying host-susceptibility
and opportunities for transmission.
One effect of fire that potentially conflicts with our hypothesis is
the possible reduction in rates of malnutrition attributable to fire
increasing the supply of food. For instance, cooking detoxified and
likely increased the digestibility of a range of foods, thereby in-
creasing the diversity of the food available (12). Because malnu-
trition is a risk factor for TB (72), improved nutrition owing to fire
would have alleviated the risk of opportunistic infection to some
extent. However, the ubiquity of the signs of metabolic disease in
recent hunter–gatherer and Pleistocene skeletons suggests nutri-
tional disorders remained relatively common (73, 74).
If humans and not other mammals were the original host of
MTBC (22), our hypothesis offers a possible explanation: the
persistence of the MTBC precursor, we argue, was only feasible in
human populations because humans were the only species capable
of controlling fire and therefore were especially vulnerable to
pulmonary mycobacterial infection. Hence, humans were the only
species able to support opportunistic infection at a sufficient rate
for the MTBC precursor to evolve transmissibility and strategies to
evade the host immune response.
Our proposal for the origins of TB and the generality of the
mathematical model results (40) serve to illustrate how a series of
events triggered by just one change to our way of life can pave the
way for the establishment of a novel human infectious disease, one
that ultimately transforms into the world’s leading cause of death
attributable to a single bacterial pathogen (41). If our hypothesis is
correct, fire use would be a remarkable example of technology
presenting itself as a double-edged sword. Benefits of fire over-
whelmingly outweigh the negatives, but the risks of technological
innovation include the possibility of novel persistent infectious
diseases (4).
Materials and Methods
Model of Infectious Disease Emergence. Our model of TB emergence in early
human hunter–gather populations builds on expressions derived in a previous
study quantifying the role of evolution in the emergence of infectious diseases
(40). In that study (40), the probability pevolve that a chain of transmission
initiated by sporadic infection from an opportunistic pathogen evolves an R0
greater than 1 was calculated as

ervoir of the pathogen, RðiÞ
0 is the basic reproductive number of the evolved
strain after i mutation events, m is the number of mutation events required for
Rð0Þ

for a strain to attain an RðiÞ
0 > 1 in the host population, we define the fitness
landscape on which evolution occurs to be

[2]
Here, we assume that the fitness effect of mutations is always additive. The
parameter z controls the curvature of the fitness landscape. When z = 1, the
RðiÞ
0 of new strains increases by a constant amount with each mutation. When z
is large, early mutations have a minimal effect on the fitness of a new strain,
whereas later mutations cause large changes to RðiÞ
0 . The opposite occurs when
z is small. Recombination is not considered explicitly in the model, but the
effect of accelerated evolution attributable to recombination can be explored
by choosing z < 1 and a small m (SI Appendix, Fig. S2B).

and the mean number of introductions of the pathogen into the human

determine the cumulative probability PðtÞ of MTBC emerging in early human
populations up to a point in time t. If the average per capita rate of infection
attributable to host contact with the pathogen’s natural reservoir is C, and NðtÞ
is the census host-population size after t years, then we can consider the
emergence of the precursor of MTBC as an inhomogeneous Poisson process
with rate parameter CpemergeNðtÞ. In this case, the cumulative probability of the

[5]
This definition assumes that humans underwent two phases of growth
whereby an ancestral phase of constant population size N0 is followed by
exponential population expansion at a rate α during the late Pleistocene (67).
We do not assume an association between the technological innovation of fire
and demographic growth.
Here, host-susceptibility is held constant through time. In the SI Appendix, we
relax this assumption and allow exposure to the pathogen to, over time, de-
crease host-susceptibility because of an increase in frequency of protective al-
leles against intracellular infection (75). The effect of this additional assumption
is to increase the mean number of introductions until emergence, thereby
delaying emergence. In the model, we set the time t = 0 to be two million years
ago, which is consistent with estimates for the age of the progenitor species of
MTBC (37).
TB Emergence Following the Advent of the Controlled Use of Fire. We assume
that the R0 of the precursor of MTBC was elevated following the advent of the
controlled use of fire because of two mechanisms: increased host-susceptibility
attributable to biomass smoke-induced lung damage and greater between-host
transmission opportunities brought about by the developing human culture. In
particular, we assume that habitual fire use caused the reproductive numbers of
precursor strains to increase by a factor L. Now, the number of mutations

and z in SI Appendix, Fig. S2.
Sensitivity Analysis. A sensitivity analysis of the cumulative probability of MTBC
emergence 70,000 y ago (P and Pf) was performed on the model with z = 0.5
(SI Appendix, Fig. S3), z = 1 (Fig. 3), and z = 2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4); 5,000 points
in the parameter space were sampled based on the Latin Hypercubic Sampling
method (76). The varied input parameters included Rð0Þ
0 , L, tf, te, α, and N0.
Details of the distributions from which the input parameter variables were
sampled are provided in SI Appendix, Table S2.
