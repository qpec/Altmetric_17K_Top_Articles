Preconception wellness reflects a woman’s overall health
before conception as a strategy to affect health outcomes
for the woman, the fetus, and the infant. Preconception
wellness is challenging to measure because it attempts to
capture health status before a pregnancy, which may be
affected by many different service points within a health
care system. The Clinical Workgroup of the National Pre-
conception Health and Health Care Initiative proposes
nine core measures that can be assessed at initiation of
prenatal care to index a woman’s preconception well-
ness. A two-stage web-based modified Delphi survey
and a face-to-face meeting of key opinion leaders in
women’s reproductive health resulted in identifying
seven criteria used to determine the core measures.
The Workgroup reached unanimous agreement on an
aggregate of nine preconception wellness measures to
serve as a surrogate but feasible assessment of quality
preconception care within the larger health community.
These include indicators for: 1) pregnancy intention, 2)
access to care, 3) preconception multivitamin with
folic acid use, 4) tobacco avoidance, 5) absence of
uncontrolled depression, 6) healthy weight, 7) absence
of sexually transmitted infections, 8) optimal glycemic
control in women with pregestational diabetes, and 9)
teratogenic medication avoidance. The focus of the pro-
posed measures is to quantify the effect of health care
systems
on advancing preconception wellness.
The
Workgroup recommends that health care systems adopt
these nine preconception wellness measures as a metric
to monitor performance of preconception care practice.
Over time, monitoring these baseline measures will
establish benchmarks and allow for comparison within
and among regions, health care systems, and communi-
ties to drive improvements.

T
he National Preconception Health and Healthcare
Initiative, a public–private partnership, advances
evidence, strategies, and innovations for improving
women’s wellness and reducing infant mortality
through the promotion of preconception health. Initi-
ated by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion in 2003, representatives from federal, state, and
local public health agencies along with clinicians and
researchers have combined resources and worked
together voluntarily to develop and implement rec-
ommendations for improving preconception health
and care in the United States.1 After a series of stra-
tegic plans over the years, domains for action have
included policy, population health indicators, con-
sumer outreach and message development, research,
public health programming, clinician education, and
evidence-gathering.2 Although progress has been
made on many fronts, clinical implementation has
lagged, hampered by a lack of consensus measures
to track quality of preconception care. To address this

 gap, we propose a set of outcome and process meas-
ures to track preconception wellness in health care
systems.
BACKGROUND
Despite ranking first in the world for health care
spending, the United States ranks 26th in infant
mortality and is the only developed country where
maternal mortality and severe morbidity are on the
rise, especially among minority women.3–5 These
trends persist despite advances in perinatal care.6 To
change this trajectory, it is essential to improve the
health status of women before pregnancy. Rising rates
of chronic conditions, including obesity, hyperten-
sion, diabetes, and substance use, have been linked
to rising rates of maternal mortality and severe mor-
bidity.7 These chronic conditions also contribute to
high infant mortality rates, principally as a result of
preterm births.8–10 In addition, women are waiting
longer to become pregnant, resulting in more first
births among women ages 35 years or older.11
Increased maternal age carries increased health risks
to both the mother and infant.12 To improve health
outcomes for mothers and their infants, we must
address women’s medical conditions, risks, and health
behaviors before pregnancy.1,13
To drive systems changes that can improve
perinatal outcomes, we propose a set of preconception
wellness metrics. Efforts to implement comprehensive
approaches to women’s health and wellness are partic-
ularly timely given changes in access to care and
coverage of preventive services occurring with imple-
mentation of the Affordable Care Act.14,15 Under this
federal act, the U.S. health care system is transforming
service financing and delivery, aiming to improve qual-
ity of care and population health while reducing per-
capita costs. The finance reforms involve shifting from
volume- to value-driven reimbursement based on
meaningful outcome measurements and incentivizing
high-quality,
cost-effective
care.
Delivery
reforms
include shifting from episodic care management to col-
laborative care that involves integration that is horizon-
tal, vertical, and coordinated.
To ensure that these reforms support optimal
preconception health, we need metrics for preconcep-
tion health care delivery. Because most pregnancies
are unplanned, these measures must assess care pro-
vided to all women—those actively desiring pregnancy
and those who become pregnant unintentionally.
Measuring preconception health care delivery is chal-
lenging given the scope of preconception care and the
breadth of domains that affect a woman’s preconcep-
tion health (eg, clinical factors, social determinants
of health, mental wellness, and access to care). As
a result, health care systems are unsure what to mea-
sure to assess current care and drive improvement or
what sectors should be held accountable for precon-
ception health care delivery.
We propose an initial composite of nine measures
that, if fully addressed through risk modification,
should improve women’s, fetal and infant health out-
comes as described in the 2008 Supplement on the
Clinical Content of Preconception Care in the Ameri-
can Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.16 These pro-
posed measures are fundamentally an index of
health care system performance rather than of indi-
vidual clinicians or practices, reflecting that multiple
health care providers, clinics, and public health pro-
grams deliver preconception care. In addition to mea-
suring
the
health
care
system’s
delivery
of
preconception care, these measures can quantify prev-
alent preconception health issues for a community or
subset of the population. We anticipate that these
measures will provide critical data to inform both
individual and system approaches to improving pre-
conception health care delivery, ultimately improving
women’s health and reducing maternal and infant
morbidity and mortality.
The importance of and procedures for precon-
ception care are well described.16,17 Health care pro-
viders of clinical care have the evidence needed to
guide preconception care, yet this care is not being
provided or documented in a way that will achieve
desired outcomes. As Stanford and Hobbins note,
“It’s not a question of whether you provide precon-
ception care, rather it’s a question of what kind of
preconception care you are providing.”18 Health care
systems have recognized that measuring quality drives
improvement. There are many accepted quality meas-
ures from a variety of institutions around chronic dis-
ease management, preventive services delivery, access
to care, patient satisfaction, and guideline adherence.

care Effectiveness Data and Information Set, National

 wellness should be distinguished from preconception
care. Women’s wellness reflects a woman’s overall health
as influenced by her clinical and psychosocial status and
her environment at any point in time. Preconception
wellness is a state of being, whereas preconception care
is a set of interventions aimed at achieving this state of
wellness.
Although components of preconception well-
ness are included in many current national and
system-based quality measures, risks specific to
pregnancy are not addressed. In fact, some existing
quality measures conflict with preconception well-
ness targets. For example, a diabetes quality mea-
sure is percent of patients with hemoglobin A1c
greater than 9%, which far exceeds the goal of less
than
6.5%
for
women
at
risk
of
pregnancy
to minimize the risk of congenital malforma-
tions.19–21
Additionally,
angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins are standard
of care for ideal control of hypertension, renal pro-
tection, and cardiovascular risk reduction in diabe-
tes; however, as a result of their teratogenic
potential, they should be avoided in the earliest
weeks of pregnancy, often before prenatal care
has begun. For a practice caring for women with
diabetes, achieving current wellness measures for
hemoglobin A1c, ACE inhibitor, and statin use
could inadvertently increase risk for adverse preg-
nancy outcomes.
The purpose of preconception care is to opti-
mize each woman’s health before pregnancy to
decrease risks during pregnancy and improve birth
outcomes; thus, an intermediate outcome of precon-
ception care is the state of a woman’s health at the
time she becomes pregnant—her “preconception
wellness.” As such, we propose that preconception
wellness be measured at completion of the initial
prenatal assessment for several reasons: 1) measure-
ment at the initial assessment minimizes the bias in
pregnancies that are detected, given that not all
pregnancies end in a birth (miscarriage, termination,
or fetal loss); 2) the first prenatal assessment is where
the effect of preconception wellness is most recog-
nized; and 3) many of the proposed measures
are already
collected as standard
care at this
assessment, minimizing the effect on clinical work-
flow. Although earlier time points (eg, before preg-
nancy)
would
be
more
inclusive
and
better
reflections of women’s wellness, the Workgroup felt
that this would not be feasible, because many
women do not enter the health care system until
pregnancy, and access to care remains limited in
the United States.22
METHODS
The Clinical Workgroup of the National Preconcep-
tion Health and Health Care Initiative was first
convened in 2006 with clinicians recruited to represent
different areas of expertise and professional organiza-
tions, including family medicine, obstetrics and gyne-
cology, maternal–fetal medicine, nurse midwifery,
nursing, and public health. Typically meeting approx-
imately four times a year, the Workgroup amplified
their efforts between November 2014 and April 2015
to develop the measures reported in this article. A two-
stage web-based Delphi survey and a face-to-face meet-
ing of key opinion leaders of the Clinical Workgroup
were used to develop consensus for a framework to
measure preconception wellness.23 Measures subjected
to the Delphi survey were identified by systematic lit-
erature review and stakeholder feedback. Reviewers
informally ranked the importance of the measures
based on the ease of implementation and evidence to
affecting improvement. During this time the group met
five times along with three segments of meeting prep-
aration work and one segment of postmeeting work.
Consensus panel members provided feedback between
survey stages. Through iterative literature review and
discussion, members reached full consensus around
surrogate preconception care measures that reflect the
receipt of quality care from the health care system and
their ability to affect maternal and child health out-
comes. Steps to reach consensus included: 1) defining
preconception care compared with preconception well-
ness or health, 2) determining when to measure quality
preconception care and wellness, 2) reviewing evidence
for all potential measures, 4) assigning value and feasi-
bility to each measure, 5) achieving consensus on
a minimal core set of preconception wellness measures,
and 6) assessing whether this core set of measures could
be prioritized.
More than 20 preconception wellness measures
were considered for inclusion. The criteria used in
assessing the potential preconception wellness meas-
ures are shown in Box 1. A matrix was created to
grade each potential measure as high, medium, or
low value in its congruency with currently accepted
quality measures, ease of extraction of reliable data
from electronic health records, the evidence available
for reducing identified risks, effect on pregnancy out-
comes (for both women and infants), and ability to
affect change within the health care system. Current
quality measures from national reporting groups were
crosswalked with preconception care components to
determine what might already be captured as discrete
data. The panel discussed each potential measure until

 it had reached complete consensus. Our goal was to
define the smallest number of metrics that would cap-
ture the greatest proportion of a woman’s preconcep-
tion wellness.
CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION:
PRECONCEPTION WELLNESS MEASURES
Nine measures met consensus group criteria for value
and feasibility to index a woman’s preconception well-
ness on entering pregnancy. Table 1 displays the rec-
ommended measures with suggested data sources and
target values along with a crosswalk with existing
national quality measures. A woman who met all
these targets at her initial prenatal assessment would
be considered to have a high degree of preconception
wellness. Subsequently, we summarize the evidence
and value for improving birth outcomes, the ease of
collection and extraction, standard of care and reli-
ability of data, and the rationale for each measure.
Of note, several measures assess control of existing
health conditions such as diabetes or depression; the
intention of these measures is to quantify the extent to
which women with chronic health conditions have
achieved optimal control before conception, not to
suggest that women with these health conditions
should not get pregnant.
MEASURE RATIONALE
1. Pregnancy intention (evidence and value: high;
ease and reliability: medium). Unintended preg-
nancy is a risk factor for adverse birth outcomes
and a key indicator for access to and use of
reproductive health care. Currently, more than
50% of pregnancies in the United States are
unintended (mistimed or unwanted).24,25 This
measure affects all women. It is not a currently
reported quality measure. A validated measure
of pregnancy planning and intention, the Lon-
don Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy, has
been proposed.26
2. Access to care (evidence and value: high; ease
and reliability: high). Initiating prenatal care in
the first trimester is a key measure of health care
access and improves birth outcomes by allowing
early risk assessment such as anomaly screening
and implementation of evidence-based interven-
tions to prevent adverse outcomes. It also may be
a marker of a woman’s connection to a health
care system. This measure affects all women. It
is a core quality measure for federally qualified
community health centers.27,28
3. Multivitamin with folic acid use before conception
(evidence and value: high; ease and reliability:
medium). Preconception folic acid supplementa-
tion is associated with a 70% reduction in neural
tube defects.29 Including a multivitamin with
folate has additional benefits in birth outcomes.30
However, this benefit is primarily seen if the mul-
tivitamin with folate is consumed before concep-
tion. Most women take a prenatal vitamin during
pregnancy but currently less than one third of
women take or are even aware of the importance
of preconception folate.31 This measure affects all
women. It is not a currently reported quality mea-
sure, although an accurate medication list includ-
ing over-the-counter medications is a part of
Patient Quality Reporting System meaningful
use standards.32

 4. Tobacco avoidance at the time of first prenatal
assessment (evidence and value: high; ease and
reliability: high). Tobacco is well known to be
one of the most important contributing risk fac-
tors in cardiovascular disease, stroke, and certain
cancers.33 Smoking cessation before or during
pregnancy decreases risks for preterm birth,
hypertensive
disorders,
intrauterine
growth
restriction, and low birth weight. This measure
affects all women who currently use tobacco
(18.7% of U.S. women 18–44 years of age).31
The preferred method of screening is use of
a structured question format (such as the 5 As),
which has been validated against biochemical
screens (such as cotinine testing) and superior
to a “yes or no” approach.34 Documentation of
tobacco use is a current quality measure for most
organizations.
5. Absence of uncontrolled depression at the first
prenatal assessment (evidence and value: high;
ease and reliability: high). Mental health issues
are common among women of reproductive
age.31,35 Stress, anxiety, depression, or other
poor states of emotional health are associated
with increased pregnancy risks and affect the
well-being of future children. Women who
are depressed are more likely to have an
unintended pregnancy, and women who are
depressed during pregnancy have worse birth
outcomes.36–38
Screening
with
the
Patient
Health Questionaire-9
or other instrument
could serve as a marker of mental health issues.
A woman with current depression that is ade-
quately treated and controlled should have
a negative screen. Universal depression screen-
ing is the standard of care and important for all
women. Depression screening is a current qual-
ity measure for most organizations.
6. Healthy weight (normal body mass index [BMI,
calculated as weight (kg)/[height (m)]2]) at the first
prenatal assessment (evidence and value: high;
ease and reliability: high). A prepregnancy BMI
of greater than 30 or less than 18 increases peri-
natal morbidity including preterm birth, pre-
eclampsia, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth.39
It is a major contributor to severe maternal mor-
bidity and mortality.40 Measuring BMI and deter-

 Assessment of BMI is a current quality measure
for most organizations.
7. Absence of sexually transmitted infections at the
first prenatal assessment (evidence and value:
high; ease and reliability: high). Active sexually
transmitted infections during pregnancy increase
perinatal risks.41 The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention has clear guidelines for screening
and all pregnant women should be routinely
screened for human immunodeficiency virus,
syphilis, and hepatitis B and selectively screened
based on risk factors for gonorrhea, chlamydia,
and hepatitis C.42 A woman with adequate access
to health care ideally would be screened and
treated or optimally managed before pregnancy.
This measure is important for all women at risk
of infection. Currently, data are reported for
chlamydia, hepatitis B, and human immunodefi-
ciency virus screening in selected risk groups.
8. Optimal glycemic control in women with preges-
tational diabetes at the time of first prenatal assess-
ment
(evidence
and
value:
high;
ease
and
reliability: high). The prevalence of pregestational
diabetes is approximately 3%.31 Poorly controlled
diabetes is strongly associated with increased
maternal and fetal risks. Improved glycemic con-
trol can significantly decrease these risks.19–21 This
measure is important for all women with a risk for
or diagnosis of diabetes. Reporting hemoglobin
A1c values for patients with diabetes is a current
quality measure for most organizations.
9. Teratogenic medication avoidance before concep-
tion (evidence and value: high; ease and reliability:
medium). A growing number of women of repro-
ductive age are treated for chronic disease—eg, dia-
betes, hypertension, chronic pain, depression,
hypercoagulable states, and seizure disorders.43
Dunlop et al44 report, “It is estimated that approx-
imately 10–15% of congenital anomalies are due to
teratogenic maternal exposures to medications,
alcohol, or other exogenous factors that have
adverse effects on the developing embryo or
fetus.” Recent studies have found that in the first
trimester, 80% women take at least one prescrip-
tion or over-the-counter medication45 and 7.5%
take four or more medications.46 Many commonly
prescribed medications are both teratogenic and
chronic disease quality measures. For example,
ACE inhibitor and statin use as quality measures
for patients with diabetes does not consider preg-
nancy intention. With optimal preconception care,
women
treated
with
teratogenic
medications
would discuss pregnancy intentions with their
health care providers; health care providers would
ensure that women not desiring pregnancy utilized
effective contraception and women planning to
conceive would be counseled on the risks and ben-
efits of potential alternative treatment regimens. If
such optimal care were provided, teratogenic med-
ication use in the first trimester would be limited to
women without effective therapeutic alternatives.
Although there are many teratogenic medications,
a few of the most common are ACE inhibitors,
angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, lithium, val-
proic acid, and warfarin.44 It is not a currently re-
ported quality measure, although an accurate
medication list including over-the-counter medica-
tions is a part of Patient Quality Reporting System
meaningful use standards.
DISCUSSION
The Workgroup debated whether these measures could
be prioritized or ranked. Of particular interest was the
primacy of pregnancy intention. However, taken alone,
even this measure would not adequately describe pre-
conception wellness. For example, a woman could plan
a pregnancy, yet not be taking folic acid supplementa-
tion, be a current smoker, have an active sexually
transmitted infection, be unknowingly taking a terato-
genic medication, and have inadequate glycemic control
of her diabetes. This would not be considered entering
pregnancy with a high degree of preconception wellness
despite her pregnancy intention. No one measure taken
in isolation is enough to describe preconception well-
ness, but, taken in aggregate, these nine measures
adequately reflect a state of more optimal preconception
health. By collecting and reporting on these measures,
health care systems will be better informed as to the state
of preconception wellness for the women they serve and
be equipped to develop targeted strategies aimed at
improving preconception care for a particular popula-
tion or community.
A variety of additional measures were considered,
including optimal blood pressure management in
women with hypertension; optimal interpregnancy
interval (greater than 18 months and less than 59
months); immunizations; alcohol use; substance use;
interpersonal violence screening; stress screening;

conception health and birth outcomes. Although all of

 these areas are important to women’s health and pre-
conception wellness, they were excluded from the cur-
rent list of recommendations, because they did not
meet the previously described criteria. The group
was challenged by the need to offer health care sys-
tems and clinicians a concise list of areas with the best
evidence for risk modification. The nine measures
chosen are in many ways linked to these other factors
and thus could serve as surrogates for the wide array
of risks affecting women of reproductive age.
SHARED ACCOUNTABILITY
The time has come to expand accountability for
pregnancy outcomes and the health of the next gener-
ation. By measuring the state of preconception wellness,
system leaders will identify issues needing attention in
their particular community and be able to benchmark
improvements. If women in a particular health care
system are receiving their primary care or well woman
care within the same clinic where they receive prenatal
care, these measures can serve as an important metric of
success. For women who receive their well woman care
in other contexts, improving preconception wellness
measures will require cross-clinic and multidisciplinary
collaborations to enhance care delivery. These measures
will also identify local priorities for preconception
wellness, many of which will require community-wide
partnerships. For example, high rates of unplanned
pregnancy and lack of preconception folate use might
prompt a health care system to focus on contraceptive
access and folic acid education or distribution program
as their main initiatives in the community. Conversely,
high rates of teratogenic medication use and uncon-
trolled diabetes might prompt primary care and spe-
cialty clinician education around preconception risks in
women with chronic disease and may lead to collabo-
ration with care management teams and pharmacy
initiatives in addition to direct to consumer education
initiatives. In each case, both public and private health
and community programs across all disciplines must
promote preconception wellness. Everyone bears a por-
tion of the responsibility for preconception wellness—
from community health workers and home visitors to
health educators, primary care providers, family plan-
ning providers, and specialists as well as hospital system
administrators, payers, policymakers and, of course,
women themselves.
CONCLUSIONS
The Preconception Health and Health Care Initiative
Clinical Workgroup recommends that health care
systems adopt these nine core preconception wellness
measures. These measures will provide a metric to
monitor performance of preconception care practice,
thereby improving women’s preconception wellness.
Implementation will require modest but feasible
changes in clinical workflow and electronic health
record design to ensure that each measure is captured
as a discrete data point by completion of the initial
prenatal assessment. These steps will ensure that mea-
sure reports can be derived from the electronic health
record.
Baseline
measures
will
inform
quality
improvement initiatives in primary care as well as
community outreach and public health initiatives.
Over time, monitoring will establish benchmarks
and allow for comparison within and among regions,
health
care
systems,
and
communities
to
drive
improvements. Implementing these quality measures
and developing proven strategies to optimize wellness
will require research at the health care system level.
Funding organizations must prioritize research utiliz-
ing these measures so health care systems and
communities can determine best practices for imple-
mentation, assess for key measurement outcomes and
consequences, and develop interventions within com-
munities that can improve preconception wellness.
Although there is work ahead to operationalize these
preconception wellness measures, we believe that the
growing focus on providing quality well woman
preventive care sets the stage for widespread adop-
tion. The health of women of reproductive age is
essential, both for women’s own well-being and pro-
ductivity as well as for that of future generations.
