Multiple myeloma (MM) has benefited from significant advancements in treatment that have
improved outcomes and reduced morbidity. However, the disease remains incurable and is
characterized by high rates of drug resistance and relapse. Consequently, methods to select
the most efficacious therapy are of great interest. Here we utilize a functional assay to assess
the ex vivo drug sensitivity of single multiple myeloma cells based on measuring their mass
accumulation rate (MAR). We show that MAR accurately and rapidly defines therapeutic
susceptibility across human multiple myeloma cell lines to a gamut of standard-of-care
therapies. Finally, we demonstrate that our MAR assay, without the need for extended culture
ex vivo, correctly defines the response of nine patients to standard-of-care drugs according to
their clinical diagnoses. This data highlights the MAR assay in both research and clinical
applications as a promising tool for predicting therapeutic response using clinical samples.

ultiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the accu-
mulation of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow1, 2.
Therapeutic advances have greatly reduced the mor-
bidity and mortality in this disease through the incorporation of
novel-targeted agents such as proteasome inhibitors, (e.g. borte-
zomib and carfilzomib)3, immunomodulatory drugs (lenalido-
mide, pomalidomide)4, novel antibodies (daratumumab and
elotuzumab)5, 6, and HDAC inhibitors in a treatment regimen
that includes traditional chemotherapeutic agents and high-dose
therapy with stem cell transplants7. Despite these advances, MM
remains incurable in the vast majority of patients although there
is a high degree of variability in patient survival. This variability is
in part due to the heterogeneity of the disease at the molecular,
clonal, and cellular level, which affects MM cells’ susceptibility
and resistance to therapies8–12.
Today, most approaches—especially in solid tumors—define
therapeutic susceptibility based on the presence or absence of
genetic or epigenetic markers13. However, these approaches have
had limited success, primarily due to two factors: a lack of vali-
dated biomarkers, and an inability of these bulk assays to identify
and probe the response of small resistant subpopulations. Existing
biomarkers are validated based on response across large patient
populations, which weakens their reliability as predictors of
individual patient response, particularly following relapse post
treatment with biomarker-specified therapy14,
15. Single-cell
sequencing can resolve cellular heterogeneity, but this approach
still requires previously defined genetic markers and suffers from
persistent issues concerning throughput16.
In contrast to these genetic and epigenetic approaches, func-
tional assays aim to offer a direct measurement of therapeutic
response providing a phenotype-based evaluation of drug sus-
ceptibility using patient cells. For therapeutic susceptibility assays,
a functional biomarker is a measurable, integrative parameter of
all genetic, epigenetic, and environmental cues that affect cells’
therapeutic susceptibility17. Functional assays are already key to
patient care decisions, where measurement of patient disease
burden by imaging or direct quantification from the peripheral
blood is used as a retrospective, treatment guiding indicator of
therapeutic response. Ideally, however, functional assessment
would occur prior to therapy selection and administration of drug
to the patient, thereby preventing the patient morbidity and
mortality associated with selection of inefficacious drugs.
The difficulties facing functional testing of drug susceptibility
in cancer are distinct from their genomic biomarker-based
counterparts. Despite their long-term, widespread use for in vitro
studies, there has yet to be a prospective, in vitro functional assay
routinely applied in the clinic. Historically, functional assays are
limited by a variety of factors including requirements for large
tissue samples, artifact-inducing long-term cell culture, and bulk
measurement approaches. These requirements are complicated

 further by a lack of ex vivo primary cell proliferation in most
diseases, including MM. Despite these difficulties, the appeal of
functional indicators of drug susceptibility that are treatment
agnostic has encouraged continued development. Recent progress
in single-cell functional assays have mitigated some of these
shortcomings and show promise for identification and targeting
of subpopulations of response on small samples18–20.
We recently introduced an approach to functionally assess
single-cell therapeutic susceptibility by determining mass accu-
mulation rate (MAR) and mass of single cancer cells18, 21–24.
Using a microfluidic device known as the suspended micro-
channel resonator (SMR), we measured the mass of individual
cells repeatedly over 15–20 min intervals to define single-cell
MARs. In acute lymphocytic leukemia and glioblastoma models,
we previously showed that MARs of single, sensitive cells are
reduced when measured following exposure to targeted small-
molecule therapies, whereas cells with a resistance mutation to
that therapy will maintain MARs matching that of control
conditions25.
Here we demonstrate the capability of this assay to functionally
assess the therapeutic sensitivity of single MM cells to standard-
of-care (SOC) and experimental therapies. Utilizing a high-
throughput MAR measurement platform known as the serial
SMR (sSMR) (Fig. 1a)25, we validate the MAR response of human
MM cell lines and primary patient samples when treated with
SOC therapies including dexamethasone, lenalidomide, and
bortezomib. We show MAR is reduced in response to SOC
therapies administered alone and that combinations of therapies
resulted in larger magnitude reductions in MAR. Additionally, we
observe MAR response when using a peptide-based therapeutic
approach for targeting E2F/DP1 interaction in combination with
BET inhibitor JQ1. This indicates the compatibility of the MAR
assay with peptide-based therapeutics and also suggests that
functional MAR measurements could potentially assess and select
for patient sensitivity to a range of experimental MM therapies.

 measuring buoyant mass (hereafter referred to as “mass”) of
single, live cells as they flow through a suspended microchannel
with a precision of ~50 fg, roughly 3 orders of magnitude less
than the total mass of a cell18, 23, 24. The serial SMR consists of an
array of these sensors that are fluidically connected in series and
separated by delay channels (Fig. 1a). Cells flowing through this
array take ~1.5–2 min to travel across each delay channel, which
enables us to weigh each cell 10–12 times (depending on the
number of sensors on the device) over the course of ~20 min
(Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1). Cell MAR, defined as the
net change in mass over time, is determined by calculating the
slope of linear least squares fit as a function of time applied to a
set of individual mass measurements from the same cell (Fig. 1b,
c).

 resulting sSMR data are two-dimensional, capturing both MAR
and the average single-cell mass over the duration of the
measurement as independent biomarkers (Fig. 1d). By applying
these measurements to the IL-6-dependent human MM cell line,
ANBL-6, we can characterize the heterogeneity in mass and MAR
across the population (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, the single-cell
resolution of the MAR assay allows characterization of pheno-
typic subpopulations18, 25.
MAR defines therapeutic response to proteasome inhibition.
We first investigated the cellular response of MM cells to borte-
zomib, a proteasome inhibitor that is commonly used as frontline
therapy28–30. Bortezomib leads to protein accumulation and cell
death by impairing protein catabolism in the proteosome. We
studied the impact of bortezomib on MAR and buoyant mass
using wild-type ANBL-6 human MM cell line (ANBL-6.WT) and
its bortezomib-resistant counterpart (ANBL-6.BR)26, 27. Treat-
ment of ANBL-6 WT cells with bortezomib at a therapeutically
relevant concentration of 5 nM for only 1 h significantly decreases
MAR relative to baseline without altering the distribution of mass
(Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 2). The reduction of MAR
becomes progressively more pronounced with longer durations of
bortezomib exposure until all the cells have negative MARs, and
the mass distribution begins to shift lower. In contrast, when the
same conditions are applied to bortezomib-resistant ANBL-6.BR
cells, no significant change is observed in either MAR, mass, or
negative MAR fraction demonstrating that resistant cells main-
tain normal growth when subjected to inefficacious therapies
(Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 2). The same data can be
represented on a single axis, where the MAR of each cell is
normalized by the mass of that same cell (Fig. 2b). Mass is well
characterized in clonal cell lines as a proxy for cell cycle posi-
tion24, so by normalizing to cell mass we can account for size and
cell cycle-dependent effects18. In comparison, bulk viability test-
ing (Fig. 2c) required 10 h of bortezomib exposure to observe
response, showing that reduction in MAR precedes loss of cell
viability.
To demonstrate the robustness of our MAR measurements for
classifying single-cell therapeutic sensitivity, we determined the
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) after performing linear
discriminate analysis (LDA) for each combination of treatment
vs. control data sets. LDA projects the two-dimensional MAR and
mass data onto a single axis that best distinguishes these two
populations and defines a threshold for this classification (Fig. 2d).
We then performed ROC curve analysis and calculated the area
under the curve (AUC), which is a metric of the identification of
each cell’s classification as sensitive or resistant to a drug31. For
instance, a random classifier has an AUC = 0.5, while a perfect
classifier has an AUC = 1. The AUC for all drug conditions tested
on ANBL-6.BR cells is ~0.5, consistent with treated resistant cells
being indistinguishable from untreated cells. In contrast, ROC
curves for ANBL-6.WT cells show excellent resolution of treated
and untreated groups as AUC converges to one for longer
bortezomib exposure (Fig. 2e). To test whether increasing drug
concentration allows for a better discrimination between treated
vs. untreated cell populations, we exposed ANBL-6.WT cells to a
range of bortezomib concentrations between 0.5 and 20 nM for 5
h and observed greater reduction in MAR at higher concentra-
tions (Fig. 2f). As expected, AUC rapidly increases with
concentration, approaching one for dosages at or above the
therapeutically relevant 5 nM concentration.
MAR defines response to combination therapy. Next, we
explored the concept of whether change in MAR can define
response to combinations of agents, which is a treatment para-
digm that has not been explored in previous studies of MAR. To
fully validate this, we studied MAR response to a wider range of
SOC single agents as well as to combinations of these agents used
clinically. First, we evaluated the effect of dexamethasone and
bortezomib alone and in combination in three human MM cell
lines with variable dexamethasone and bortezomib sensitivity.
This includes the ANBL-6.WT and ANBL-6.BR cell lines dis-
cussed above, the MM.1 cell line, which is either dexamethasone
sensitive (MM.1S) or resistant (MM.1R), and the U266 cell line,
which is sensitive to both agents. These cell lines were exposed to
either 5 nM bortezomib or 200 nM dexamethasone alone or in
combination for 3 h prior to measurement. As seen in Fig. 3a, the
bortezomib-sensitive
ANBL-6.WT
cells
show
a
significant
reduction in MAR in all treatment groups compared to control.
More importantly, the reduction in MAR is more pronounced in
the drug combination, compared to the single agent dex-
amethasone or bortezomib. In contrast, we observe no additional
magnitude of reduction in MAR following addition of bortezomib
to dexamethasone in bortezomib-resistant ANBL-6.BR cells,
These two observations confirm the ability of our MAR assay to
selectively identify response to these two drugs. Analogously, both
dexamethasone and bortezomib show a significant reduction in
MAR as single agents in dexamethasone-sensitive MM.1S cell
line, with the drug combination displaying more pronounced
effect (Fig. 3b). This similarity holds for the dexamethasone-
resistant MM.1R cell line where the reduction in MAR is the same
for bortezomib alone or bortezomib in combination with dex-
amethasone; the dexamethasone-alone treatment group cannot be
distinguished from controls. Results using U266 cell lines are
analogous to those of the sensitive ANBL-6.WT and MM.1S cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. 3).

MM.1S cells (bortezomib and dexamethasone sensitive) reduces upon the exposure to bortezomib and dexamethasone, while that of MM.1R cells
(dexamethasone resistant and bortezomib sensitive) reduces only upon the exposure to treatment containing bortezomib. Boxes represent the inter-

 The corresponding ROC curves for ANBL-6.WT and MM.1S
show that the ability to resolve single cells between untreated and
treated groups increases with combination therapy as compared
to either therapy alone (Fig. 3c, d). The AUC converges toward
one for drug combinations but remains constant in cell lines with
resistance to either of the two agents alone. Serving as a good
internal
control, the bortezomib-resistant
ANBL-6.BR
cells
treated with 5 nM bortezomib and dexamethasone-resistant
MM.1R cells treated with 200 nM dexamethasone have AUC of
~0.5, a result indistinguishable from untreated control. Bulk
viability responses show a reduction in viability for the drug
combination that begins earlier in time compared to the
monotherapies for ANBL-6.WT and MM.1S cells. In contrast,
the timing of viability loss appears to be only due to the
efficacious therapy in ANBL-6.BR and MM.1R cells treated with
combination therapy (Fig. 3e, f). The timing of cell viability loss is
correlated with the reduction in MAR following 3 h of drug
exposure for all bortezomib and dexamethasone conditions
tested, consistent with a progressive reduction of MAR up to a
limit prior to loss of cell viability (Supplementary Note 3 and
Supplementary Fig. 8).
We next evaluated the effect on MAR of a highly efficacious
cytotoxic and immunomodulatory drug, lenalidomide, alone and
in combination with bortezomib using both bortezomib- and
lenalidomide-sensitive U266 and MM.1S cell lines32–34. Similar to
the aforementioned combination therapies, the combination of 5
nM bortezomib and 3 µM lenalidomide produces a greater
reduction in MAR as compared to either drug alone (Fig. 4a, b).
The corresponding ROC curves also demonstrate consistent
behavior, with AUC values converging toward one when
considering drugs in combination vs. monotherapies (Fig. 4c,
d). Again, reductions in viability are first observed at 10 h of drug
exposure, well after measured reductions in MAR at 3 h (Fig. 4e,
f). Furthermore, in contrast to bortezomib and dexamethasone
combination, viability measured at a 2-h interval was less
correlated to the timing of viability loss (Supplementary Note 3
and Supplementary Fig. 8).
MAR defines response to an investigational peptide-based
inhibitors. Having confirmed the applicability of our assay to a
subset of approved SOC agents in MM, we next evaluated its
application in experimental setting using novel small molecule
and peptide-based inhibitors. Recently, we have shown that the
combined inhibition of BRD4 and E2F is effective at killing MM
cells in vitro and in vivo in MM cell lines and primary MM
cells35. BRD4 is inhibited via the BET bromodomain inhibitor
JQ1, and E2F is inhibited using a modified, cell-penetrating
polypeptide (rk19) with the ability to abrogate E2F1-DP1 het-
erodimerization and therefore suppress E2F activity. We tested
MAR response in U266 and MM.1S cells following treatment
with 50 nM JQ1 and 20 µM of rk19 blocking peptide alone or in

Fig. 6 MAR defines therapeutic sensitivity in multiple myeloma patient
samples. a MAR per mass of 12 samples from 9 patients is shown for
control and treatment group under two drug combinations of 5 nM
bortezomib, 200 nM dexamethasone, and 3 µM lenalidomide. Samples are
divided into three groups, sensitive, resistant, and negative based on the
clinical tests. Red denotes the initial control group response, and blue and
green denote the treatment groups under dexamethasone + bortezomib
and lenalidomide + bortezomib drug combinations with same drug

exposure to drug treatments (p < 0.0056), while resistant (p > 0.47) and
negative fraction (p = 1) show negligible variations. p values are calculated
using Welch’s t-test, comparing treated cells to the control (only cell
media), and were Bonferroni corrected. Full list of p values for a, can be

 combination. As seen in Fig. 5a, b, we observed reduction in
MAR by both agents used alone and a more pronounced
reduction when they are used in combination. The corresponding
ROC curve also confirmed analogous changes to AUC with the
administration of multiple drugs, where values converge to one
for drugs in combination vs. monotherapies (Fig. 5c, d). Finally,
the viability of the cell lines similarly shows that reduction in the
viability begins earlier for drugs combination compared to single
drug therapy. (Fig. 5e, f and Supplementary Note 3).
Therapeutic sensitivity determined by MAR correlates with
patient response. To confirm applicability of our assay in clinical
setting and to validate MAR sensitivity determinations with
actual clinical responses observed in the patients, we utilized
purified primary myeloma cells from nine patients (P1-P9) iso-
lated both before and following initiation of therapy (Fig. 6,
Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Figs. 9–17, and Supple-
mentary Tables 1–13). Double-blinded methods were used for six
of nine patients, (excluding P1, P2, and P7). For all patient
samples, cells were measured on the SMR within the 24 h fol-
lowing selection by ficoll gradient and CD138+ magnetic-
activated cell sorting from the whole bone marrow. In the case
where samples were provided by outside institutions, cells were
shipped at room temperature as whole bone marrow overnight.
We evaluated change in MAR following drug exposure in purified
CD138+ MM cells from all nine patients and the flow-through
CD138-negative fractions (containing no MM cells) from patients
P6, P7, and P9. In order to best characterize the behavior of
primary samples, we dosed cells with single drugs and drugs in
combination for 3 h prior to measurement on the SMR. This
included 5 nM bortezomib, 200 nM dexamethasone, and 3 µM
lenalidomide, or the combination of bortezomib with either
dexamethasone or lenalidomide. For two patients, P6 and P9, the
common clinical combination of all three drugs was also inves-
tigated. Following unblinding, patient samples were divided into
sensitive and resistant groups based on evaluation of clinical tests
and applying IMWG criteria (e.g., IgG or IgA, M-spike, Kappa
FLC or L FLC levels; see “Methods” and Supplementary Note 4),
as well as a third group for negative fractions.
MAR measurements of these samples correctly classified the
response to drug combinations compared to clinical markers of
response. For all nine patients and three negative fraction
samples, we used a Bonferroni-corrected sensitivity threshold of
p < 0.0056 vs. DMSO controls (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Note 4).
Sensitive patient samples (P1-P6) showed greater reduction in
MAR in response to combinations as compared to single
therapies, mirroring response trends seen in cell lines (Fig. 6
and Supplementary Note 4). Furthermore, this trend held for the
triple combination as compared to the combinations of two drugs
in P6 (Fig. 6b, c and Supplementary Note 4). Across combina-
tions of two drugs in sensitive patients, all samples treated
showed reductions in MAR that are significantly lower than in
resistant samples, beyond p < 0.0056 for all samples following
Bonferroni correction (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Note 4). In
comparison, in resistant samples (P7, P8, and P9), combinations
of two drugs yield little to no change in MAR, with all corrected p
values at p > 0.47 (Fig. 6a, d, e and Supplementary Note 4). MAR
measurements of negative fractions (no MM cells) were also
performed for the patient samples P6, P7, and P9. These negative
fraction cells are expected to display no response to drug
treatment

pathways,
and
consistently, samples treated with drugs alone or in combination
show no reduction of MAR, with p = 1 for all conditions tested as
compared to controls following Bonferroni correction (Fig. 6a
and Supplementary Note 4). For sensitive patient samples, ROC
curves of these single-cell data sets have an average AUC of 0.82
across all combination conditions tested. In comparison, AUC for
combination conditions in resistant and negative samples were
0.52 in both cases, consistent with treated populations being
indistinguishable from DMSO controls. The relative average
AUCs of sensitive vs. resistant patient samples are consistent with
MAR and mass having predictive power at the single-cell level
(Supplementary Note 4). We also measured cell viability before
and after each drug condition experiment and observed that cell
viability showed negligible variations for both control and
treatment conditions within the experiment duration for all
patient samples (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Discussion
This work demonstrates the capability of MAR measurements to
functionally assess the therapeutic susceptibility of MM cells.
Using human MM cell lines with known drug sensitivity, we
confirmed the ability of MAR to correctly define response to SOC
agents lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone at the
single-cell level. For these therapies, we show that MAR response
assesses differential susceptibility of cells to drugs as mono-
therapies as well as in combination. Furthermore, MAR response
was able to assess sensitivity to experimental MM therapies,
including the BET inhibitor JQ1 and a peptide-based therapeutic
targeting E2F/DP1 interaction, highlighting the potential of
functional MAR measurements to assess therapeutic response in
research setting.
Here we show that the MAR assay reveals drug sensitivity in
primary myeloma cells across nine patients that were both sen-
sitive or resistant to therapy. In cases of defined sensitivity, we
detected a significant decrease in MAR following exposure to
conventional single or combination therapies. Such reduction in
MAR was not observed in resistant patients. Importantly, we have
analyzed results both retrospectively (P3, P6, P7, P8, P9, Sup-
plementary Note 4), where samples were collected after patients
have received therapies, and prospectively (P1, P2, P4, P5, Sup-
plementary Note 4), where we analyzed MAR response before
patients received therapy. In both cases, MAR response was
consistent with clinical outcomes, suggesting that this assay can
be used to prospectively determine treatment decisions (Supple-
mentary Note 4). The patient samples were randomly selected
and represent a typical clinical scenario, where the majority of
patients being treated for relapsed disease will remain sensitive to
therapy, while a smaller fraction will present with resistant dis-
ease. Thus, our representative data suggests that the MAR assay
has the potential to be used to select the best treatment options
among both single and combination therapies in patients with
relapsed disease, although additional SOC drugs must be
tested for compatibility with the MAR assay (Fig. 7). This
approach should also be evaluated for directing treatment choices
in newly diagnosed patients, especially when using novel agents
(Fig. 7).
Due to its unique characteristics, the MAR assay shows pro-
mise to make distinctive contributions to clinical practice as well
as research. For clinical assessment, assaying the therapeutic
sensitivity of primary MM samples ex vivo is more challenging
than cell lines, since the amount of sample is often not sufficient
for canonical bulk assays. In addition, cells do not proliferate
without exogenous factors and viability declines rapidly once they
are removed from the bone marrow niche. Here MAR assays were
performed on primary samples as small as ~5 × 104 cells split
across seven conditions, and in previous research we assessed
single-cell MAR response to therapeutics with as few as 1000 cells
in 10–20 µL18. Reduction of MAR in myeloma cells occurs in less
than 4 h following treatment, precedes loss of viability and does

 not require proliferation, making MAR measurements uniquely
suited to working within the constraints of MM primary samples.
Finally, because it is a single-cell approach, this assay also iden-
tifies cellular heterogeneity in response to each of the agent. In
future research, it will be interesting to correlate this hetero-
geneity with the type and duration of clinical response achieved,
or to study the effects of selected agents on non-malignant cells to
predict toxicity.
In our assay, cells remain viable at the time of susceptibility
measurement, and each single cell can be isolated downstream of
the SMR18. For research applications, this capability combined
with the ability to distinguish between sensitive and resistant
populations in cell lines or primary samples, can enable hetero-
geneity in single-cell susceptibility phenotypes to be correlated
with non-functional, genetic biomarkers, or other downstream
orthogonal assays18, 25, 36. Driven by these correlations, molecular
pathways associated with therapeutic resistance or other pheno-
types could be identified and specifically targeted with combi-
nation strategies likely to be synergistic.
The MAR assay has its own set of challenges that appear on
both sides of the therapeutic axis, involving cell state maintenance
and capturing the cell-extrinsic factors related to drug response.
As with other functional assays based on ex vivo treatment, many
of the microenvironmental effects which influence in vivo drug
response are excluded in ex vivo drug exposure. Bone marrow
microenvironment cues significantly affect the survival of MM
cells, and the removal of these signals for even less than 24 h
could greatly affect drug response. Thus, it is likely that our
drug sensitivity measurements, where ex vivo treatment is applied
to isolated MM cells, primarily reflects cell intrinsic properties.
Furthermore,
therapies
like
lenalidomide
and
thalidomide
have
both
direct
cytotoxic
effects
and
effects
through
immune modulation, which could not be observed in isolated
MM cells treated exclusively ex vivo. Future studies should
include the use of co-culture environments with stromal and
immune cells prior to ex vivo treatment to assess impact of
specific microenvironmental cues, or activation of certain cell-
extrinsic responses.
Methods
Cell culture of the conventional cell lines. MM.1S, MM.1R, and U266 cells are
maintained in suspension in RPMI-1640 media (Gibco, Ref#11875-093), supple-
mented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Ref#F4135), 0.02 M Hepes (Gibco, Ref#1X
Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Gibco, Ref#15240-062), and kept in a 37 °C, 5% CO2, and
humidified incubator. ANBL-6.WT and ANBL-6.BR cells are maintained in the
same media supplemented also with 5 ng/mL of IL-6, while ANBL-6.BR cell media
contains additional 2.5 nM bortezomib (Takeda), which is added to cell media
every other passage. Cells are passaged every 4 days to 2 × 105 cells/mL. The
approximate cell concentration used in SMR experiments is 1.2 × 105. All cell lines
were kindly provided by sources previously described8, ATCC, or the German
Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. All cell lines tested negative for
mycoplasma.
For drug experiments, cells in 24-well plates are dosed with 5 nM bortezomib,
200 nM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich), 3 µM lenalidomide (Celgene), 50 or 200
nM jq1 (kindly provided by Jun Qi), or 20 µM rk19. rk19 (Celtek Bioscience, LLC)
has the sequence A-A-V-A-L-L-P-A-V-L-L-A-L-L-A-P-R-R-R-V-Y-D-A-L-N-V-
L-M-A-M-N-I-I-S-K, where the N-terminal 16-a.a. sequence (bold) is a cell-
permeable sequence37 and the C-terminal 19-a.a. sequence is the H2 fragment
derived from the DEF box region in DP-138. Peptide is purified by HPLC with
purity greater than 90%. For SMR experiments including dexamethasone therapy,
in addition to control tests, we also perform controls with the media containing
DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, Ref#D2438). Cells are kept drugged during the
measurements, which lasts ~1.5 h. All conventional cell lines are suspended in their
standard growth media. Only ANBL-6 cells grows in clumps, and a gentle pipetting
is performed to dissociate cells from each other (Supplementary Note 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 3). Replicate MAR assays were performed across ANBL-6 lines,
but not for MM.1 and U266 lines. All bulk assays were performed in triplicate.
Patient sample procurement and processing. Primary multiple myeloma spe-
cimens were collected from patients at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute upon
provision of informed consent under a tissue banking protocol (Dana-Farber
Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) protocol #07-150). The protocol has been
approved by the DF/HCC institutional review board (IRB), and all relevant ethical
regulations were followed. Bone marrow mononuclear cells and primary MM cells
are isolated using Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient sedimentation from BM aspi-
rates MM patients following informed consent and IRB (Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute) approval. MM patient cells are separated from BM samples by antibody-
mediated positive selection using anti-CD138 magnetic-activated cell separation
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Gladbach, Germany). For the ex vivo drug treat-
ment, aliquots are treated with 5 nM bortezomib, 200 nM dexamethasone, and 3
µM lenalidomide and assessed using the serial SMR platform. Patient samples did
not allow for replicates of individual conditions on the same samples due to
samples size and other practical constraints.

Fig. 7 Schematic of treatment pipeline for multiple myeloma patients. Following diagnosis, patients undergo induction therapy (for example, combination of
bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone), followed by either consolidation therapy, or in eligible patients, autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) with
consolidation. This is followed by maintenance therapy. However, even with sustained maintenance therapy, almost all patients inevitably relapse. At the
time of relapse, a clinical decision is made to choose from an array of therapeutic options, including many combination therapies. To inform this decision,
patient history is considered (for example, prior therapies received) combined with the physician’s clinical experience (solid lines). Response duration varies,
but eventually relapse occurs, and the same process repeats. Post-relapse drug selection is where the sSMR and assaying cell MAR response would be of
greatest utility, allowing more precise clinical determination of therapeutic strategy by adding an important data point to the physician’s decision-making
process (dotted lines). Results of the assay could inform which drug combinations are most likely to elicit complete response, as well as potentially being
linked to other clinical outcomes such as progression-free survival. In addition to the post-relapse setting, MAR response could also help inform initial
selection of induction therapy, especially with the growing list of available agents, to help maximize the probability of a complete response

Scientific, Ref#4208A). The particles provide a baseline for zero mass accumulation
rate as well as a calibration reference for measuring absolute buoyant mass of the
flowing cells. The sample is delivered to the device through PEEK tubing (IDEX-
1577) that is connected to pressurized vials containing the sample and waste tubes.
By controlling the pressures supplied to each vial, we set the flow rate of the cells
such that they can flow through the device in 15–20 min. After the experiment, we
analyze the data taken from each sensor for determining the MAR of the cells using
a Hungarian-based matching algorithm that was discussed elsewhere25. The tem-
perature of the device and the sample vial is kept at 37 °C by circulating heated
water through the aluminum blocks holding the device and the sample vials. The
temperature of the tubing between the sample vials and the device is also controlled
using an extra layer of tubing around the PEEK tubing.
Before each MAR measurement, the SMR microfluidics is coated with 10 µM
poly-L-lysine/polyethylene-glycol (PLL-PEG) (SuSoS AG, Ref#PLL(20)-g[3.5]- PEG
(2)) in order to prevent cells from sticking to microchannel walls. In order to
reduce cell clumping, we utilized cell media containing 5 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Fluka Analytical, Ref#03690) and 10 uM
PLL-PEG. See Supplementary Note 2 for the effect of cell stickiness on time delay
of cell travel between two sensors. Between runs, cleaning protocols are performed
in order to remove any organic residue sequentially using filtered solutions of
0.25% trypsin or 10% bleach and then water followed by 5% Micro-90.
Comparisons between resultant single-cell data are performed by various
statistical methods. Welch’s t-test was commonly applied to compare conditions
where distributions of single-cell measurements are normal with similar variance.
All p values were Bonferroni corrected.
Serial SMR devices. All the samples investigated in this work are analyzed in
devices that are fabricated by CEA-LETI on 8-inch silicon wafers using previously
described microfabrication methods22, 39. Detailed information on the design of the
devices and the measurement platform were given elsewhere25. Changes and
improvements are described in the Supplementary Note 1.
