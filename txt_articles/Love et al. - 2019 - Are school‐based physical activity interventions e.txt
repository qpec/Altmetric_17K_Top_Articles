Summary
The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing at epidemic rates globally, with
widening inequalities between advantaged and disadvantaged groups. Despite the
promise of schools as a universal context to access and influence all children, the potential
of school‐based interventions to positively impact children's physical activity behaviour,
and obesity risk, remains uncertain. We searched six electronic databases to February
2017 for cluster randomized trials of school‐based physical activity interventions.
Following data extraction, authors were sent re‐analysis requests. For each trial, a mean
change score from baseline to follow‐up was calculated for daily minutes of
accelerometer‐assessed moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA), for the main
effect, by gender, and by socio‐economic position (SEP). Twenty‐five trials met the
inclusion criteria; 17 trials provided relevant data for inclusion in the meta‐analyses. The
pooled main effect for daily minutes of MVPA was nonexistent and nonsignificant. There
was no evidence of differential effectiveness by gender or SEP. This review provides the
strongest evidence to date that current school‐based efforts do not positively impact
young people's physical activity across the full day, with no difference in effect across
gender and SEP. Further assessment and maximization of implementation fidelity is
required before it can be concluded that these interventions have no contribution to make.

INTRODUCTION
The worldwide prevalence of childhood obesity has increased tenfold
over the past four decades.1 Obesity in childhood increases the risk of
noncommunicable diseases in adulthood, which are estimated to
cause 71% of the world's deaths.2 The lifetime health care and
productivity costs of childhood obesity have been estimated at
€149,206 per child.3 Physical inactivity is a key contributor to
childhood obesity,4 and international guidelines recommend that
young people aged 5–18 years accumulate “at least 60 minutes of
moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily”.5 However, glob-
ally 81% of adolescents do not meet these guidelines.6 Furthermore,
physical inactivity is socially patterned, contributing to inequalities in
associated health outcomes.7 In particular, children who are socio-
economically disadvantaged and girls are more likely to be physically
inactive
than
children
who
are
more
advantaged
and
boys.8,9
Promoting health equity by reducing inequalities in health behaviours
is increasingly a priority for national and supranational bodies.10

 Governments worldwide are prioritizing obesity prevention and
health equity promotion through, amongst other things, increasing
physical activity in young people. As schools offer a context to reach
the majority of young people irrespective of background characteris-
tics, they provide an obvious intervention setting. However, evidence
for the effectiveness of school‐based physical activity interventions is
mixed,11 with positive effects proving challenging to maintain over the
long term.12 Furthermore, it is unclear whether population subgroups
benefit equally from current efforts. There is theoretical and empirical
evidence that public health interventions can exacerbate existing
inequalities via differential effects between population subgroups.13
Inequitable effects have been demonstrated in some school‐based
physical activity interventions,14 but there is an overall scarcity of
evidence on this possibility.15 Even a null effect overall may mask
differential effects between population subgroups.
The majority of early evidence on school‐based physical activity
interventions showed positive effects, but used self‐report measures,16,17
which have limited validity and differential bias across population
subgroups.18 Whilst more recent reviews are restricted to objective
measures, they commonly combine data from a variety of tools
(eg, accelerometers and pedometers),19 measurement periods (eg, recess
only and whole day) and outcomes (eg, MVPA and average activity
intensity).20,21 The potential impact of this is exemplified by one trial in
which the effect estimate on accelerometer‐assessed activity during
school (when children were directly exposed to the intervention) was
more than four times the effect across the full day (z Scores: 0.92 vs.
0.21, respectively).22 Given that most school‐based interventions are
designed to affect total activity across the day, and that total MVPA is
most strongly associated with different health benefits,23 the most
rigorous evaluation of the overall and equitable impact of school‐based
physical activity interventions requires a focus on whole day MVPA.
Our recent scoping review of physical activity interventions in
young people revealed an overall scarcity of published evidence on
equity effects.15 However, it identified that substantial relevant
unpublished data were available—particularly in terms of gender and
socioeconomic position (SEP) in relation to school‐based interven-
tions. Here, we therefore aimed to systematically review and meta‐
analyse data on the overall effectiveness of school‐based physical
activity interventions on accelerometer‐assessed daily minutes of
MVPA, and investigate if this effect varies by gender or SEP.

METHODS
This systematic review and meta‐analysis is reported according to the
PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (ref
CRD42017062565) and is included as Supplementary information
(S1). There were no substantive changes to protocol.

Search strategy and selection criteria
The literature search was conducted in six electronic databases (ERIC,
EMBASE, OVID MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus),
originally in May 2016 (scoping review), and updated for the current
review in February 2017. The search aimed to identify controlled trials
of physical activity promotion in young people that used objective mea-
sures of physical activity. The search strategies were prepiloted with no
restrictions by publication year, geographic location, or other socio‐
demographic indicators. The search strategy as conducted in Medline
is included as S2. Additionally, published systematic reviews from the
field were searched to check for any missing studies.16,17,20,24
In order to focus on a homogeneous pool of trials and enable in‐
depth exploration of equity effects, and on the basis of our assessment
of data availability, the inclusion criteria from the scoping review were
made more restrictive for the current review. We limited inclusion to
interventions conducted primarily in schools (84/113 trials included in
scoping review), and to cluster‐randomized (at the school or classroom
level) controlled trials, which used accelerometers to assess activity
across the whole day. The full inclusion criteria are outlined in Table 1.
Following deduplication, title, and abstract screening removed
papers clearly outside of the scoping review inclusion criteria. The

 selection was performed by one reviewer, with a 15% random sample
double checked by a second reviewer (coder agreement rate was
98%). Full text screening was performed independently by the same
two reviewers. All discrepancies were resolved through discussion.
Intervention characteristics were extracted from included trials
using
a
prepiloted
data
extraction
form.
Data
extraction was
performed in duplicate by two reviewers, and included baseline
descriptives, study name and design, intervention and outcome
characteristics, reported intervention main effect, and effects across
gender and SEP (see S3 for a complete list of items).
Quality
assessment
was
performed
independently
by
two
reviewers using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Studies
were assessed across each of the five domains of bias (selection,
performance, attrition, detection, and reporting) and classified as pre-
senting a low, high, or unclear risk of bias. In the case of disagreement
on data extraction or quality assessment, consensus was determined
by consulting the third reviewer.
None of the included trials reported sufficient relevant data for the
planned analyses, and thus all authors were contacted to obtain further
information. Corresponding authors of the main trial publications
were contacted in May 2017 by email. Data request forms were
precompleted as far as possible from published papers and authors
requested to further complete these. Requested data included sample
size (N), mean, and standard deviation (SD) of daily minutes of MVPA
at baseline and all follow‐ups for both intervention and control groups,
for the main intervention effect, and stratified both by gender, and SEP.
If possible, we requested authors categorize SEP into three groups
(low, middle, and high, as defined by the author). Where this was not
possible, two groups representing low and high SEP were accepted. As
there are many possible measures of SEP, we provided authors with a
preference hierarchy: (1) parental education (maternal preferable to
paternal), (2) area‐based markers of deprivation (eg, Index of Multiple
Deprivation or postal code‐based indices), and (3) household income
equivalized for household composition. This hierarchy was developed
based on research evaluating the importance of measures of socioeco-
nomic status in child and adolescent populations.25,26 The decision was
also pragmatically based on data availability as assessed in data extrac-
tion. The full request details and data extraction form is included as S4.

Data analysis
To assess overall and differential intervention effects on MVPA, mean
change scores from baseline to follow‐up were calculated for intervention
and control groups. For each analysis the post‐intervention follow‐up
time closest to intervention end point was utilized. Intervention effects
were calculated by dividing the between group difference of mean
change in minutes of MVPA from baseline by the pooled SD of change
in MVPA for the intervention and control group, assuming a correlation
of r = 0.5 between baseline and follow‐up (see S5 for full formula).27
Effect sizes were calculated using Hedges' g and utilized in
meta‐analyses. Random effects meta‐analyses were chosen as hetero-
geneity was expected given differences in study populations and
interventions. Differences in effect by gender and SEP were tested
statistically
by
performing
meta‐regressions
on
the
stratifying
variable in a meta‐analysis model pooling the individual subgroups
for that characteristic.
Statistical heterogeneity was assessed visually using forest plots
and quantified using the χ2 and I2 statistics. By convention, I2 values
of 25% were consider low, 50% moderate, and 75% high. The poten-
tial for publication bias was assessed visually using funnel plots and
Egger's test for funnel plot asymmetry. Since the use of random effect
models may overestimate treatment effects, fixed effect models
(which produce more conservative estimates) were also conducted
and compared as a sensitivity analysis (see results presented in S9).
Preplanned subgroup meta‐analyses and a series of meta‐
regression were performed to examine if selected intervention charac-
teristics explained heterogeneity in effect sizes (if I2 ≥ 50%). Three
continuous variables (intervention duration, sample size, and mean
participant age) were tested in meta‐regressions through multivariable
random effects models. To consider between‐trial variance, a method
of moments, random effects meta‐analysis was utilized. Subgroup
analyses were then run to investigate if heterogeneity could be
explained by categorical characteristics of interest (intervention com-
ponents, behavioural approach, intervention setting, and risk of bias
summary score).

RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the PRIMSA flow chart for the entire review process.
Twenty‐five trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. The
reasons for exclusion at the full text phase (n = 119) are outlined in
S6. Eight trials were excluded from meta‐analyses following data
requests (n = 25) because of: no response (n = 5), data being unavail-
able (n = 1), or data not provided in the required format (n = 2) (See
S7). Characteristics of the final 17 trials included in the meta‐analyses
are summarized in Table 2 and S8. 22,28-43
The mean baseline sample size of included trials was 464
participants (median: 436; inter‐quartile range (IQR): 178‐700). The
duration of interventions ranged from 1.5 to 24 months, with a
median of 6 months (IQR: 5‐12). The majority of included trials were
conducted in Europe (65%) followed by Australasia (23.5%), North
America (5.9%), and South America (5.9%). Overall, 53% of trials pre-
sented a high‐risk of bias summary score, 18% low and 29% unclear.

intervention effects
The main effect meta‐analysis showed a nonexistent (SMD: 0.02) and
nonsignificant (95% CI, −0.07‐0.11) pooled effect of interventions on
daily minutes of MVPA (Figure 2).
Figure 3 outlines the intervention effects by gender. The girls'
meta‐analysis indicated a trivial (SMD: 0.07), but nonsignificant effect
(95% CI, −0.07‐0.21). Similar findings were seen for boys (SMD: 0.05;
95% CI, −0.09‐0.19). There was also no evidence of a statistically
significant difference in intervention effect between girls and boys
(P‐value: 0.97).
Similarly, there was no evidence of differential intervention effect
by SEP. Figure 4 outlines the effect on children from low SEP (SMD:

Exploration of heterogeneity: Meta‐regressions
and subgroup analyses
Meta‐regressions revealed no evidence of heterogeneity by sample
size (P‐value: 0.57), intervention duration (P‐value: 0.98), age (P‐value:

SMD with increasing mean participant age.

(See S9). There was insufficient heterogeneity in intervention compo-
nents (social environment, physical environment, and educational
components) to enable subgroup analyses.

DISCUSSION
This systematic review and meta‐analyses provide the strongest
collated evidence to date on the effectiveness school‐based physical
activity interventions. We found that when restricted to cluster‐
randomized controlled evidence utilizing accelerometer‐measured
outcomes, school‐based interventions in children and adolescents

 are not effective in increasing minutes spent in MVPA across the full
day, and this did not differ by gender or SEP.
To our knowledge, this is the first meta‐analysis in young people's
physical activity promotion to pool accelerometer data with compara-
ble outcome metrics. To rigorously answer our research questions, we
collated mean daily minutes of MVPA measured by accelerometer.
This decision was made in consideration of: a need for objective
measurements that are equally valid across population subgroups,18
the importance of full day activity change for health benefit,23 and
evidence of differential health benefits related to different physical
activity intensities.44 Whilst accelerometers have been shown to pro-
vide valid and reliable estimates of physical activity in children, they
have inherent limitations including an inability to classify behaviour,
detect certain activities (eg, cycling and swimming), upper body move-
ments, or changes in terrain.45 Successful author re‐analysis requests
enabled, for the first time, the pooling of intervention accelerometer
data with comparable outcome metrics. Moreover, standardized and
complete outcome data (N, mean, and SD), permitted the utilization
of mean change effect estimates, an approach that strengths the
robustness of the findings by accounting for group baseline differ-
ences.46 However, the analyses included only a subset of relevant
available data (n = 8 were excluded because of inadequate or
unavailable
data).
Calculation
of
Rosenthal's
failsafe
number,
representing the number of studies that would be required to refute
the main effect meta‐analytic conclusion, indicates low potential for
biased conclusions.47 We estimate that at least 20 further trials, all
with significant and positive intervention effects, would be needed
to alter the main findings (see S10). Moreover, no evidence of publica-
tion bias was observed, even in the subset of studies included in the
analyses. Lastly, whilst it is concerning that 53% of included trials
had an overall high risk of bias score, a subgroup meta‐analysis by risk
of bias was not significant. High risk of bias scores were primarily
driven by attrition and lack of clarity regarding how missing data were
handled within the analyses (S11).
The major strengths of this review compared with previous work
are the pooling of comparable accelerometer‐based outcome mea-
sures of full‐day MVPA and assessment of equity effects. In contrast,
previous reviews used either self‐reported outcomes,16,17 or pooled
effects of incomparable outcomes derived from objective tools.20,21
We restricted inclusion to objective measurements given evidence of
poor validity and reliability of self‐report and observational methods.18
Additionally, given growing evidence of differences in activity intensi-
ties and patterning between subgroups of children,48 we restricted
inclusion to trials for which we could obtain accelerometer assessed
minutes of MVPA across the full day. Our scoping review,15 identified
that asking authors to conduct re‐analysis was the only way to obtain
relevant data on equity effects by gender and SEP. Thus, in addition to
providing a pool of comparable data, these author requests allowed us
to exploit the potential of much data that had been collected, but not
previously reported on. Restricting inclusion to a homogeneous group
of school‐based trials limits the generalizability of our findings to
school‐based efforts to promote physical activity. However, this
represents the majority of the available evidence and maximized the
reliability and robustness of our conclusions.
Whilst a lack of an overall effect could mask opposing effects in
different population subgroups, we found no evidence of an effect in
any gender or SEP subgroups. This suggests either that the interven-
tion components are not effective or that they are not reaching target
populations, rather than they are effective in some groups but not
others. Substantial effort is commonly devoted to intervention
theory and development, as demonstrated by the included KISS and
CHANGE! trials.49,50 We suggest that similar attention is now
required to understand the intervention implementation process of
these complex interventions and how this can be optimized in differ-
ent contexts. The complex and multicomponent nature of most
school‐based physical activity interventions may make them particu-
larly vulnerable to poor implementation fidelity.51 Prior evaluations
have demonstrated considerable differences in intervention intensi-
ties between classes and schools.52 Process evaluations are critical
to understanding implementation success and the contextual factors
that influence how an intervention works. However, on the basis of
the pool of studies included in this review, process evaluations are
rare: only 24% (n = 4) of included trials conducted a process evalua-
tion.53-56 Three of these process evaluations assessed the issue of
intervention fidelity, each concluding wide variance in implementation
of the program across schools and settings. Beyond determining if the
intervention “worked”, outcome evaluations do little to inform future

 theory development, or context‐specific policy and practice. Robust
evaluations of interventions known to be delivered with maximum
possible implementation fidelity are required to confirm that school‐
based interventions are not effective in changing physical activity.
Until then, we recommend that school‐based activity promotion
interventions are only implemented in research contexts and that
investigators make substantial efforts to maximize, measure, and
understand the impact of implementation fidelity across the interven-
tion process.
Despite the promise of schools as a universal context to influence
health behaviours, our review and emerging trial evidence,57 suggest
that current efforts are not having an impact. It is unlikely that we will
make substantial changes to population levels of, and inequities in,
physical inactivity and obesity in children by focusing our collective
efforts on only one setting, such as schools, when the wider environ-
ments are insufficiently supportive for behaviour change.58,59 This is
exemplified by some trials reporting positive effects during school
hours, which are attenuated when assessing activity across the whole
day as analysed here.22 Multidimensional intervention strategies
across settings are likely required to achieve sustained effects across
the whole day. In evaluations, the contribution of different compo-
nents within such strategies needs to be carefully considered and
assessed to maximize cost‐effectiveness.
This review focused on a subset of the literature on physical
activity promotion in young people: school‐based interventions. We
also restricted our assessment of equity effects to gender and SEP.
Our scoping review revealed sufficient RCTs in school settings
utilizing objective physical activity measures across the full day, how-
ever limited data on equity characteristics beyond gender and SEP.15
There is, thus, a need for further primary research in different inter-
vention contexts using high‐quality outcome measures, and reporting
outcomes both overall and across a range of different equity
subgroups. This may require coordinated effort towards fewer, high‐
quality studies, powered to detect subgroup differences. Given
theoretical and empirical evidence that interventions can be differen-
tially effective across population subgroups,13 it is critical that relevant
equity characteristics are assessed. Whilst it may not be possible to
power all studies to address equity questions, consistently collecting
these data will enable future meta‐analyses like ours. It may also be
timely to consider the standardization of outcome reporting in physi-
cal activity trials. In 35% of trials included in this review, published
conclusions of positive effects were not confirmed in our re‐analysis
using the a‐priori established outcome measure of accelerometer‐
derived minutes of MVPA across the whole day.34,36,39,40,60,61 All
interventions included in this review were hypothesized to change
activity across the whole day and whilst individual trials may have
had different primary outcomes for good reason, it is important not
to lose sight of the overarching aim of physical activity promotion—
to improve health outcomes. This requires a focus on full day
behaviour, and an increased understanding of effectiveness across
times and settings.62 We further encourage, at a minimum that
authors are accommodating to re‐analysis requests. Working towards

CONCLUSION
This systematic review and meta‐analysis demonstrate that school‐
based physical activity interventions have not been effective at
increasing children's accelerometer‐measured daily time spent in
MVPA. This null effect is equitable across gender and SEP. These null
results may be due to well‐designed interventions not reaching the
target populations as intended, or effects not maintained across the
day. Further assessment and maximization of implementation fidelity
is required before it can be concluded that school‐based activity
promotion interventions have no contribution to make to reducing
physical inactivity and obesity in children. We recommend that for
now, further school‐based activity promotion interventions should
continue to be conducted in a research context.
