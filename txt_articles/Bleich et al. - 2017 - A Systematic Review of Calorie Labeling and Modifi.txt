Abstract
Background—Evidence on the effects of restaurant calorie labeling on consumer and restaurant 
behavior is mixed. This paper examined: 1) consumer responses to calorie information alone or 
compared to modified calorie information, and 2) changes in restaurant offerings following or in 
advance of menu labeling implementation.
Methods—We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Policy File and PAIS International to identify 
restaurant calorie labeling studies through October 1, 2016, that measured calories ordered, 
consumed, or available for purchase on restaurant menus. We also searched reference lists of 
calorie labeling articles.
Results—Fifty-three studies were included: 18 in real-world restaurants, 9 in cafeterias, and 21 
in laboratory or simulation settings. Five examined restaurant offerings.
Conclusion—Due to a lack of well-powered studies with strong designs, the degree to which 
menu labeling encourages lower calorie purchases and whether that translates to a healthier 
population is unclear. Although there is limited evidence that menu labeling affects calories

 purchased at fast-food restaurants, some evidence demonstrates that it lowers calories purchased at 
certain types of restaurants and in cafeteria settings. The limited data on modified calorie labels 
find that such labels can encourage lower-calorie purchases, but may not differ in effects relative to 
calorie labels alone.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is associated with adverse health consequences(1–4) and substantial healthcare 
costs(5). Overconsumption of calories has been a key driver of rising obesity(6,7), and 
dining out is thought to play a significant role. Because people substantially underestimate 
the calories in prepared food(8), restaurant menu labeling was implemented in several cities 
and states(9,10) and is included in the 2010 Affordable Care Act(11,12). Chain restaurants, 
grocery stores, and other food retail establishments with 20 or more locations must post 
calorie information on their menus by May 2018 along with the statement: “2,000 calories a 
day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary.” The hope is such 
information will encourage consumers to choose, and restaurants to offer, lower calorie 
items.
This paper synthesizes the evidence on the effectiveness of menu labeling. Although we 
identified nine prior menu labeling reviews(13–21), we extend this research by reviewing: 1) 
newer studies; 2) research across restaurant, cafeteria, and laboratory settings; 3) studies 
comparing responses to calorie information (e.g., 400 calories) relative to modified calorie 
information or nutrition symbols (e.g., traffic light labels); and 4) studies of menu offerings 
following local menu labeling regulations and in advance of national regulations.
METHODS
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Policy File and PAIS International for all articles 
published through October 1, 2016, using a combination of the terms: ”restaurant,” 
“cafeteria,” “food service,” “fast food,” “labeling,” “calories” and “energy.” (See Appendix 
for search details). We also examined reference lists of calorie labeling articles. After 
removing duplicate studies, one author (K.V.) screened titles and abstracts and reviewed the 
full text for inclusion. Another author (S.B.) confirmed inclusion of these studies, and a third 
author (C.R.) adjudicated differences. Included studies had to examine the effects of calorie 
information displayed on menus using calories offered, ordered, purchased, or consumed as 
an outcome. Studies of menu offerings included research conducted before and after local 
menu labeling regulations were implemented and in advance of national calorie labeling 
implementation. We did not examine the effect of labeling on intake of other nutrients, 
although some study menus displayed other nutrition information (e.g., sodium). We also 
included studies that compared calorie information to modified presentations of calorie 
information such as traffic light labels, total recommended daily calorie statements, and 
physical activity labels (presenting the amount of time one would have to exercise to burn

 off the calories eaten). We included studies conducted among adults, adolescents, and 
children. Studies were excluded for the following reasons: 1) did not report calories offered, 
ordered, purchased, or consumed as an outcome; 2) did not use restaurant-like menus or 
used menus with a small number of items (<6 items) that may not generalize to typical 
restaurant settings; 3) only compared self-reported calorie label users to non-users; 4) 
evaluated nutrition labels on packaged foods; 5) studied another intervention (e.g., price 
changes, educational sessions) in combination with calorie information such that the calorie 
label effect could not be isolated; or 6) tested whether participants changed menu orders 
after being asked to immediately re-order from the same menu containing calorie 
information.
Tables 1–4 present details of each study’s design, methods, and outcomes based on setting. 
We summarize each study below based on setting (restaurant, cafeteria, or laboratory/
simulation) and grouped by study design (e.g. randomized controlled trial (RCT). Finally, 
we describe studies of changes in restaurant offerings after enacted or anticipated menu 
labeling regulations. Results reported as kilojoules have been converted to calories.
RESULTS
Our search yielded 3384 citations across 4 databases (see Appendix for PRIMSA flow 
diagram). After removal of duplicates (n=568), 2816 titles and abstracts were screened and 
2737 were excluded. Following full-text review, 53 articles were included.
Real-World Restaurant Settings
Eighteen of 48 studies evaluated calorie information in real-world restaurant settings (Table 
1). There was one RCT(22), one quasi-real world RCT(23), seven natural experiments 
evaluating menu labeling before and after implementation and compared to control locations 
(24–30), seven studies evaluating labeling before and after implementation without a control 
comparison (31–37), and two using cross-sectional designs to compare labeled vs. unlabeled 
locations(38,39) Three of these studies included children and/or adolescents(27,30,33).
Randomized controlled trials—Ellison et al. reported no difference in calories ordered 
after randomizing a sample of 138 customers of a full-service university campus restaurant 
to menus with either no calorie information, calorie labels, or calorie labels plus traffic 
lights(22), but the small cell size greatly limits the statistical power of the study.
In two quasi-real world RCTs, Wisdom and colleagues approached 638 customers entering a 
fast-food sandwich restaurant to complete a survey in exchange for a free meal(23). Using a 
2×2×3 design, participants were randomized to either a daily calorie recommendation 
statement or not, item calorie information or not, and conditions that made healthy 
sandwiches more or less convenient to order (healthy sandwiches were featured on an initial 
page and patrons had to open a sealed or unsealed menu to view the remaining sandwiches). 
The two studies only varied in the strength of the healthy sandwich convenience 
manipulation, so were combined for analysis. Statistically significantly fewer calories were 
ordered in both the calorie label and daily calorie recommendation conditions compared to 
Bleich et al.

 the no information group. The combination of both calorie labels and daily calorie 
recommendations led to a 100 calorie reduction.
Natural experiment with comparison site(s)—The natural experiment with the 
strongest design and largest sample size was conducted by Bollinger et al. They analyzed 
over 100 million transactions before and after the implementation of the New York City 
(NYC) menu labeling law at multiple Starbucks locations, including control sites in Boston 
and Philadelphia(24). There was a statistically significant 6% decrease in mean calories per 
transaction (15 calories on average) in NYC locations driven by changes in food, not 
beverage, calories.
Another natural experiment with a large sample size and strong design was conducted by 
Finkelstein and colleagues. They saw no effect of menu labeling over 1 year when 
evaluating pre/post transaction data from seven locations of a Mexican fast food chain inside 
King County, Washington (labeled), compared to seven locations adjacent to King County 
(unlabeled)(25).
Elbel et al. reported no change in calories ordered based on 1,156 surveys of customers 
exiting fast food restaurants in low-income neighborhoods of NYC (labeled) versus Newark, 
New Jersey (unlabeled), before and four weeks after labeling(26). Although they reported no 
decrease in calories ordered among children and adolescents (n=349)(27), the small sample 
size (e.g., Newark n=49 pre- and n=34 post-labeling) makes it difficult to draw conclusions. 
A 5-year follow-up study in the same cities found no effect of labeling among adults at four 
fast-food restaurant chains(28). Elbel and colleagues also observed no decrease in calories 
ordered in a similar study where they collected 2,083 surveys outside of McDonald’s and 
Burger King locations in Philadelphia (labeled) compared to Baltimore (unlabeled) two 
months before and four months after labeling(29). Although these studies have strong 
designs, they were powered to detect only large effects of calorie labeling (i.e. the first New 
York City evaluation had 80% power to detect a 125 kcal reduction).
Using a strong longitudinal design, but limited by a small sample size, Tandon and 
colleagues observed no differences in calories ordered among a sample of 75 parent-child 
pairs in King County (labeled) compared to 58 parent-child pairs in San Diego County 
(unlabeled)(30).
Pre/Post design without comparison site(s)—Downs et al. collected data before and 
after menu labeling implementation in NYC (no control city)(31). In addition, they 
randomly assigned 1,094 adults entering two McDonald’s locations to receive a paper slip 
with either recommended daily calories or per meal calories (for women and men) or no 
recommendation. Neither calorie labeling nor the addition of the recommendation messages 
had a statistically significant impact on calories purchased.
Dumanovsky et al. gathered receipts from 7,309 fast-food patrons prior to calorie labeling 
and 8,489 patrons after calorie labeling across 11 fast food chains at 168 locations in 
NYC(32). There was no overall effect of labeling, but statistically significant declines in

 calories purchased occurred at McDonald’s, Au Bon Pain, and KFC, while calories ordered 
at Subway increased.
Holmes et al. circulated menus for 2 months each at a full-service restaurant in a private club 
that either had: 1) no calorie information), 2) calorie and fat information, 3) an apple symbol 
added to three combos to denote “healthier” choices, or 4) nutrition bargain prices (the 
monetary price divided by a nutrition scaling factor)(33). Based on sales data, there was no 
association between label condition and calories ordered for 1,257 children’s meals.
Schwartz et al. analyzed transaction data for 399 customers eating at a Chinese quick-
service chain over several weeks(34). The primary goal of the study was to evaluate a 
portion downsizing intervention, but calorie labels were introduced during a data collection 
period. Labels were not associated with decreases in calories ordered or eaten.
Ge and colleagues analyzed lunchtime sales data at a table-service restaurant in Indiana(35). 
Each of the following interventions were delivered for one week: 1) control, 2) calorie 
information, 3) healthy symbol, and 4) calorie, fat, cholesterol, sodium and fiber 
information, alongside daily recommended values. Compared to the control week, calorie 
labels resulted in a statistically significant decrease in calories purchased. Krieger et al. 
collected receipts from 7,325 customers ≥14 years old before and after menu labeling 
implementation at 50 locations of 10 chain restaurants in King County, Washington(36). At 
18 months post-labeling, there was a non-statistically significant mean reduction of 38 
calories in all food chains (not including coffee chains) and a statistically significant 
decrease in calories purchased at taco restaurants and coffee chains.
Pulos and Leng conducted a pre/post analysis at 6 full-service restaurants in Pierce County, 
Washington, 30 days before and after displaying information on calories, fat, sodium, and 
carbohydrates(37). Beverages, certain side items, and daily specials were unlabeled. An 
analysis of 16,000 entrée orders revealed statistically significant decreases in calories 
purchased at four of six restaurants (the average entrée ordered post-labeling had about 15 
fewer calories); total calories ordered were not evaluated.
Cross-sectional comparing labeled vs. unlabeled sites—Auchincloss et al.(38) 
collected dinnertime receipts from 648 customers at two locations of a full-service restaurant 
chain in Philadelphia (labeled) and five outside of Philadelphia (unlabeled). Customers at 
labeled restaurants ordered statistically significantly fewer calories (151 calorie reduction) 
than those at unlabeled restaurants; results held when different propensity scoring methods 
were used to improve causal inference(40).
Rendell and colleagues asked 127 participants at fast-casual chain restaurant in New York 
(labeled) and 118 participants at the same restaurant in Connecticut (unlabeled) to complete 
a survey as they exited the restaurant identifying which lunch items they ordered. The 
researchers did not observe a statistically significant difference when comparing calories 
ordered between restaurants over a 6-month period(39).

 Cafeteria Settings
There were nine cafeteria studies(41–49) (Table 2). Eight evaluated menu labeling before 
and after implementation (42–48) and one was a quasi-real world RTC (49). Eight studies 
reported fewer calories purchased after labeling(42–49).
School/University Cafeteria, pre/post design without comparison site—Chu et 
al. examined calories ordered in response to labeling 12 entrées with calories, serving size, 
fat, protein, and carbohydrates in a university cafeteria(45). Sales data were collected over 
six weeks (2 weeks each for baseline, labels, and no labels). After labeling, there was a 
statistically significant 12 calorie decrease in average entrée calories ordered; information on 
overall calories purchased was not available.
Hammond et al. conducted a longitudinal study in a university cafeteria where 159 students 
completed surveys during a one-week baseline period followed six weeks later by a one-
week period when calorie labels were displayed during lunch and dinner(44). Calorie labels 
were associated with a statistically significant decrease of 91 calories ordered and 98 
calories consumed (based on self-reported intake).
Hunsberger and colleagues examined calorie labeling in a rural, low-income middle school 
cafeteria, with a baseline period of one month, followed by one month of calorie 
labeling(42). Consumption was measured at the group level by weighing food before and 
after meal service. There was a statistically significant drop in estimated mean calories 
ordered per student (based on an average of 531 students daily) from 668 to 621.
In one study, 299 female undergraduates completed a survey one month before and one 
week after calorie labels were displayed in a cafeteria. Results revealed a non-statistically 
significant mean reduction of 58 calories post labeling(44).
In one of the earliest studies of calorie labeling, Milich et al. studied 450 female employees 
at a hospital cafeteria(46). Two weeks of baseline data collection were followed by one week 
of an unexpected price increase (5–10 cents on about half of the items) followed by one 
week of calorie labels. The mean calories purchased during the baseline, price increase, and 
calorie information periods were 507, 525, and 459 respectively. Calorie labels were 
associated with statistically significantly fewer calories purchased relative to the price 
increase week (p=0.008) (a more valid comparison because prices were held constant in both 
weeks) and marginally statistically significantly fewer calories purchased relative to no 
intervention (p=0.057) (when prices also differed).
Nikolaou and colleagues followed 120 students dining at a college cafeteria over two 
years(43). No calories were displayed in year one, calorie labels were introduced for 20 
weeks in year two, then removed for 6 weeks, and then displayed for 10 weeks along with 
posters showing daily calorie requirements for young adults. Females ordered 709, 628, and 
534 mean calories and males ordered 734, 692, and 622 calories for the no label, calorie 
label, and calorie label plus daily caloric recommendation phases, respectively. Both calorie 
label phases statistically significantly differed from the control phase and from each other.

 Workplace Cafeteria, quasi-real world RCT—VanEpps et al. conducted an RCT of 
249 corporate employees who placed lunch orders for the on-site cafeteria through a website 
over four weeks(49). Employees were randomized to view menus with either: 1) no labels; 
2) calorie labels; 3) traffic lights; or 4) calorie labels plus traffic lights. Each of the label 
types statistically significantly reduced calories ordered by about 60–78 calories relative to 
no labels.
Workplace Cafeteria, pre/post design without comparison site—Schmitz and 
Fielding compared a two week baseline period without labels to a two week period of 
labeling calories, sodium, and fat at a large worksite cafeteria in southern California(47). 
Based on 823 meals, statistically significantly fewer (71 kcal) calories were ordered per tray 
following labeling.
Ussher et al. compared the calorie content of breakfast and lunch ordered at a hospital 
cafeteria in Ireland before and after calorie labeling(48). Based on 999 customers pre-
labeling and 1005 customers post-labeling, males purchased statistically significantly fewer 
calories at both meals, and females purchased statistically significantly fewer calories for 
lunch.
Laboratory and Simulation Settings
A total of 21 studies were conducted in simulation or laboratory settings (Table 3). Of the 
ten laboratory studies, five measured hypothetical food selections(50–54) and five measured 
actual food selections and consumption(55–59). Eleven simulation studies measured 
hypothetical food selections(60–70). The laboratory and simulation results are 
heterogeneous, even among studies with the strongest designs and many are limited by small 
sample sizes.
Laboratory, actual food selection and consumption—Hammond et al. randomized 
635 Canadian adults to select a free dinner from one of four Subway menus: 1) control, 2) 
calorie information, 3) calories in traffic light format, or 4) traffic lights for calorie, sodium, 
fat and sugar content(55). Food intake was measured. There were no statistically significant 
differences in calories ordered, but calorie labels led to fewer calories consumed compared 
to control.
Harnack et al. randomized 594 participants ≥16 years old to either a modified McDonald’s 
menu with calorie labels plus a daily recommended calories statement or no labels; typical 
or modified menu pricing structures was also manipulated(59). Consumption of actual 
McDonald’s meals was measured. Calories ordered and consumed did not statistically 
significantly differ across conditions.
James et al. recruited 300 young adults to eat lunch at a lab and randomized them to menus 
with no labels, calorie labels plus a statement of daily recommended caloric intake, or labels 
identifying how many minutes of brisk walking would be needed to burn off the calories in 
each item(56). Consumption was measured and post-meal intake was assessed with a dietary 
recall interview. Only the exercise labels resulted in statistically significantly fewer mean

 calories ordered and consumed relative to the control group, but it did not statistically 
significantly differ from the calorie label group.
Platkin et al. recruited a very small sample of 62 female participants with overweight or 
obesity from a college campus to order and eat a Burger King lunch in the lab(57). They 
returned one week later for a second lunch where they were randomized to menus with 
either no labels, calorie labels, or calories plus physical activity labels (minutes to burn off 
calories by walking). At the second lunch, the no label, calorie, and physical activity groups 
ordered 25, 206, and 162 fewer calories, respectively. Mean calories consumed at the second 
lunch were 995 (control), 899 (calorie labels), and 841 (physical activity labels). These 
differences were not statistically significant.
Roberto et al. randomized 295 participants to one of the following menus: 1) control, 2) 
calorie labels, or 3) calorie labels and a statement of recommended daily caloric intake(58). 
Food intake was measured, and post-dinner intake was assessed via a dietary recall 
interview. Although participants in both calorie label groups ate statistically significantly 
fewer calories at dinner compared to the control group, those who received a menu with only 
calorie labels ate more calories after dinner. Only the group viewing the calorie 
recommendation ate statistically significantly fewer overall calories at dinner plus after 
dinner (approximately 250 kcal reduction) compared to the control group.
Laboratory, hypothetical food selection—A study by Gerend et al. randomly assigned 
288 college students to a McDonald’s-like menu that either did or did not have calorie 
information(50). Participants made hypothetical choices based on three different dinner 
descriptions (quick dinner, participant is very hungry, or not too hungry). The effects of 
calorie information were similar across the three scenarios, so data were combined. There 
was a statistically significant interaction such that men were unaffected by calorie labels, but 
women ordered 146 fewer calories when shown labels.
Lee and Thompson recruited 643 undergraduate students for an online survey(51). 
Participants were randomized to one of three groups: 1) no nutrition information; 2) calorie 
information; or 3) calorie information plus miles needed to burn off item’s calories and 
ordered from a hypothetical fast food menu. Total calories ordered did not statistically 
significantly differ across groups.
Reale and Flint recruited 61 people with obesity from a weight management service and 
conducted a randomized crossover trial where participants were asked to place a 
hypothetical order from one of the following four menu conditions: 1) no label, 2) calorie 
label, 3) information on fat, protein, carbohydrates, salt and fiber, or 4) energy expenditure 
label (52). Participants were exposed to each menu condition on a separate day, starting with 
the no label condition on the first day. All 3 experimental conditions resulted in a 
statistically significant reduction in calories ordered compared to the control group. The 
calories group had a 26% reduction.
Stutts et al. randomized 236 children (6–11 years old) to a McDonald’s menu with either no 
labels, calories and fat information, or a healthy heart symbol placed next to healthier menu 
Bleich et al.

 items(53). Calorie labels had no effect, but the healthy heart symbol led to statistically 
significantly fewer calories ordered.
Wei and Miao randomly assigned 189 participants to place hypothetical orders from menu 
boards with or without calorie information from either a restaurant perceived as “healthful” 
(i.e., Subway or Panera) or “unhealthful” (i.e., McDonald’s or Wendy’s)(54). Calorie labels 
led to a 96 calorie reduction when ordering from healthful restaurants, but there was no 
statistically significant effect when ordering from unhealthful restaurants.
Simulation, hypothetical food selection—Antonelli and Viera randomized 823 
parents of a child aged 2 to 17 to one of four online fast food menus: 1) no labels, 2) calorie 
labels, 3) calories plus minutes of walking required to burn off calories, or 4) calories plus 
miles to walk(60). All labeling conditions resulted in statistically significantly fewer 
hypothetical calories ordered compared to no labels, with the calorie label leading to 380 
fewer calories ordered. Minutes of walking led to 440 fewer calories ordered, while miles of 
walking led to 370 fewer calories ordered compared to no labels. The labels did not 
statistically significantly differ from one another(60,70).
Dodds et al. randomly sampled 329 Australian parents with a child (3–12 years) from a 
larger random study sample(61). After a telephone interview, participants were randomized 
to receive a fast food menu in the mail with either: 1) no labels; 2) kilojoule labels plus a 
statement indicating the daily energy intake for adults; or 3) traffic light labels. The labels 
had no effect on total energy selected for parents or children.
Downs et al. recruited 921 pedestrians from busy public locations using a mobile research 
lab and randomized them to one of the following 10 groups: 1) control group, 2) basic 
information (3 sub-groups, including calorie labels), 3) contextualized numeric information 
(3 sub-groups) and 4) heuristic cues (3 sub-groups; e.g., traffic light ratings)(62). 
Participants made hypothetical snack selections. There was no effect of calorie labels, but 
contextualized numeric information and heuristic cue labeling led to a statistically 
significant decrease in calories ordered compared to the control group.
Dowray et al. randomized 804 online participants to one of four menus with either: 1) no 
labels, 2) calorie labels, 3) calorie labels plus miles of walking, or 4) calorie labels plus 
minutes of walking needed to burn calories in each item(63). Only the miles of walking label 
led to statistically significantly fewer hypothetical calories ordered relative to no label, but it 
did not differ from the other labels.
Haws and Liu randomized 245 online participants to calorie labels (present vs. absent) or 
pricing (linear vs. quantity discounted, such that price per unit of a product was lower for 
larger portion sizes)(64). Participants made a hypothetical dinner choice from a menu with 
10 entrées each with a full or half size option. People ordered statistically significantly fewer 
calories when viewing labels, and calorie labeling plus linear pricing led to the fewest 
calories ordered.
Liu et al. randomly assigned 418 online participants to one of four menus: 1) no labels 2) 
calorie labels, 3) calorie labels arranged from low to high, or 4) calorie labels arranged from 
Bleich et al.

 low to high plus red or green traffic lights indicating higher/lower calorie choices(65). All 
label conditions included a statement about recommended daily caloric intake. None of the 
label groups statistically significantly differed from control, but when analyses were 
repeated controlling for gender, hunger, and reported frequency of nutrition label use, rank-
ordered calorie labels led to statistically significantly fewer calories ordered (1606 calories) 
compared to no labels (1760 calories).
Morley et al. randomized 1,294 online Australian participants to one of five hypothetical 
menus: 1) no information, 2) kilojoule information, 3) kilojoule information plus each item’s 
percentage of recommended daily intake, 4) kilojoule information plus traffic lights, or 5) 
kilojoule information plus each item’s percentage of recommended daily intake plus traffic 
lights(66). Only calories and calories plus traffic lights led to statistically significantly fewer 
calories ordered (117 and 119 fewer calories, respectively) relative to no labels.
Pang and Hammond randomized 213 undergraduate students to one of four Tim Horton’s 
snack menus: 1) control, 2) calorie information, 3) calorie information plus recommended 
daily caloric intake statement, or 4) calorie information plus a physical activity label(67). 
Only calorie labels and calories with a daily intake statement led to statistically significantly 
fewer calories ordered compared to control. None of the label groups statistically 
significantly differed from one another.
Roseman et al. recruited 302 urban pedestrians from a downtown street of a medium-sized 
US city(68). Participants completed a survey and were randomized to either a calorie-labeled 
or unlabeled menu that displayed seven items from several fast food restaurants. There were 
no statistically significant differences in hypothetical calories ordered.
Tandon et al. randomized 99 parents in a primary care pediatric clinic in Seattle, 
Washington, to a McDonald’s menu with or without calorie labels(69). Calorie labels led 
parents to hypothetically order 102 fewer calories for their children compared to no labels. 
The parents’ choices for themselves did not differ.
Changes in Restaurant Offerings
Five studies examined changes in the calories of restaurant menu offerings after local menu 
labeling regulations were implemented or in advance of national implementation (Table 4)
(71–75). Two studies evaluated menu offerings where local menu labeling laws were 
implemented(73,75); one of these studies included a control comparison(75). Three studies 
examined restaurant nutrition data at the national level(71,72,74). No studies looked at 
cafeteria offerings in response to calorie labeling.
Pre/Post design with comparison site(s)—Namba et al. examined 9 fast food 
restaurant chains in 2005 and again in 2011 post-local labeling(75). Five of these chains had 
some labeled locations, while 4 had restaurants not subject to labeling. Although the mean 
calories of menu items offered in labeled cities did not change, the proportion of healthy 
items statistically significantly increased in restaurant chains with some labeled locations 
(from 3% to 20%).

 Restaurant trends where labeling is present, without comparison site(s): Bruemmer et 
al. examined calorie content of menu items at 37 chain restaurants in King County, 
Washington, and found a statistically significant decline in overall average entrée calories 
(41 fewer calories post-labeling; 73 fewer calories at full-service restaurants and 19 fewer at 
quick-service restaurants) when comparing 6 and 18 months post labeling(73).
National restaurant trends in advance of national menu labeling: Bleich et al. reported 
that the mean calorie content of national chain restaurant menu items available between 
2012–2014 did not change, but new items in 2013 and 2014 had fewer calories than items 
only available in 2012(71). In addition, cross-sectionally, chains with voluntary labeling 
(n=5) had lower calories than those without labeling (n=61)(72).
Wu and Sturm tracked changes in the energy and sodium content of U.S. chain restaurant 
main entrees between spring 2010 (right after the passage of national menu labeling 
legislation) and spring 2011(74). They found no overall changes, but fast-food restaurants 
statistically significantly decreased mean energy in children’s menu entrees by 40 calories 
whereas upscale restaurants statistically significantly increased mean energy in children’s 
menu entrees by 46 calories.
DISCUSSION
The strongest research design to evaluate menu labeling is a randomized-controlled field 
experiment. Unfortunately, only one such study was identified and the sample size was too 
small to be able to detect even medium-to-large effects(22). Two other quasi-real world 
randomized-controlled field experiments of menu labeling demonstrate that it led to a 
statistically significant and fairly large reduction in calories ordered(23,49). The best 
designed natural experiment with a large sample size reported a 15 calorie reduction in 
response to calorie labeling among Starbucks customers(24). In contrast, a well-powered, 
well-designed natural experiment at taco restaurants reported a null effect(25). Although two 
other well-designed natural experiments reported null effects of calorie labeling at fast food 
restaurants, both studies were only powered to detect large effects of calorie labeling(26,29). 
Further, there was only one real-world, full-service chain restaurant analysis with an 
adequate sample size, which found that calorie labeling was associated with a 150 calorie 
reduction, but this study was limited by a cross-sectional design(38). Although other reviews 
have concluded that menu labeling has little impact on fast food purchases (13–16), there is 
an extraordinary dearth of well-designed and adequately powered studies to truly test this 
hypothesis in both fast food and full-service chain settings.
In general, laboratory/simulations studies produce similar mixed results. Although these 
studies use RCT designs, many are also limited by small sample sizes. Many laboratory 
studies of fast food orders generally reported no change in calories ordered(51,57,59,61,68), 
while laboratory studies mimicking full-service chain restaurants or restaurants typically 
perceived as healthier found labels led to fewer calories ordered or consumed(55,58,67).
These divergent findings across restaurant settings and studies may emerge because 
restaurant type affects calorie label use or attracts different types of patrons. It is possible

 that patrons of coffee chains, full-service sit-down chains, or fast food outlets that market 
themselves as “healthy” attract patrons with higher incomes, education levels, and/or health 
consciousness who are more likely to use labeling(76–79). Secondary analyses and 
laboratory studies also report that awareness and/or use of menu labels is higher among 
certain consumers, such as women and those with higher incomes and health consciousness. 
It is also possible that calorie labeling is more influential in certain settings. Fast food 
customers, for example, may enter the restaurant knowing what they want to order, while 
full-service sit-down patrons may spend more time reviewing the menu before making their 
decision. In addition, full-service chain restaurants, compared to fast food, are more likely to 
have very high calorie items, even for items like salads that most people think are low-
calorie. There was also more consistent evidence that calorie labeling can promote lower 
calorie choices in cafeteria settings, perhaps because people eat there more regularly and are 
less likely to view the meal as a “treat” compared to dining out. The sole randomized-
controlled cafeteria field experiment reported a statistically significant and substantial 
reduction in response to calorie labels, but this may have been because people were ordering 
food ahead of time, which might have enabled them to exert more control over their 
decisions compared to ordering on impulse when in the cafeteria (49). Many of the other 
cafeteria studies did not have comparison sites to control for secular trends, suggesting a 
need for more research in these settings.
Fewer studies have examined modified calorie information (e.g., daily recommended intake 
statement) relative to calorie labels and these results are highly variable across settings 
(22,23,31,33,35,43,49,51–53,55–67,70). Presumably, making calorie information easier to 
understand and more accessible to a greater range of individuals, particularly those with 
lower numeracy levels, would increase the reach and impact of such information, but real-
world randomized-controlled trials are needed to know for sure.
Finally, although preliminary evidence suggests that recent calorie labeling regulations 
(enacted or anticipated) may be correlated with healthier restaurant offerings, the small 
number of studies, considerable differences in design, lack of comparison sites, and 
heterogeneity across included restaurants make it difficult to draw conclusions at this point.
This review has several limitations. First, we may not be capturing a number of null studies 
because of publication bias. In addition, article screening was conducted by a single author 
which could have led to a biased sample; however all potential articles for inclusion were 
reviewed by a second author and adjudicated by a third, as necessary. Strengths of this 
review include examining a large number of studies of both consumer and restaurant 
responses to calorie labeling across multiple settings and comparing modified to absolute 
calorie information.
Taken together, evaluations of menu labeling in different settings are mixed and much of the 
research is plagued by inadequate study designs and/or underpowered studies, highlighting a 
considerable need for more research. First, data from well-powered RCT field experiments 
or natural experiments testing menu labeling are needed, especially at full-service chain 
restaurants. These studies are very difficult to conduct because they require the cooperation 
of a food retail establishment that has not already implemented labeling. Second, we do not

 have a good understanding of how people might compensate later if they reduce calories at 
one meal in response to menu labeling and nearly all real-world studies only assessed 
calories purchased, not consumed. Third, because much of this legislation is fairly recent, 
and the federal law’s implementation date is May 2018, there are also limited data on the 
long-term impacts of calorie labeling. Fourth, more research is needed to understand 
whether different presentations of this information can increase its impact or whether 
accompanying educational campaigns might increase the effect of menu labeling. Fifth, we 
lack good data on whether calorie labeling in other settings impacted by the regulation, such 
as supermarkets, influences purchases. Finally, research examining impacts on BMI in 
jurisdictions that have implemented menu labeling would be useful. Currently, there is one 
such study that we are aware of. Restrepo used data between 2004 and 2012 from 103,220 
respondents from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system who self-reported height and 
weight. Using a natural experiment design, the authors compare BMI trends over time in NY 
and nearby counties with and without calorie labeling. The results revealed that, on average, 
calorie labeling laws were associated with a statistically significant reduction of 0.38 BMI 
units(81). This further suggests that underpowered studies may not be picking up 
meaningful reductions in calories purchased at restaurants.
CONCLUSION
Overall, because of a lack of well-powered studies with strong designs, the jury is still out 
on the degree to which menu labeling encourages lower calorie purchases and whether that 
translates to a healthier population. Although the limited existing research finds little 
evidence of menu labeling shifting fast-food purchases, there are more promising findings 
that it may influence consumers at certain types of restaurants and in other types of 
establishments such as cafeterias. It is difficult to know what a meaningful reduction in 
calorie intake amounts to, particularly when it is hard to measure how people compensate 
over the course of a week. Researchers have estimated that if we want to return to 1970 
levels of excess weight in the population, adults would need to consume 220 fewer calories 
daily(82), while children would need to consume 165 fewer calories daily(83). Reducing 
consumer purchases in chain restaurants by even a small amount may help reduce this 
excess calorie intake. Finally, menu labeling may encourage restaurants to offer lower 
calorie items, but it is currently unknown whether studies focused on calorie changes in 
chain restaurants are capturing responses to menu labeling legislation (enacted or 
anticipated) rather than responses to other forces encouraging restaurants to change their 
menus.

 What is known?
•
Menu labeling is one of the few major, federal laws passed in the last decade 
to address obesity and poor diet
•
The primary goal of menu labeling is to inform consumers about the number 
of calories in restaurant food
•
Prior reviews of menu labeling have shown little impact on customers’ 
purchases at fast-food restaurants
What this study adds?
•
Unlike prior reviews of menu labeling, this review examines multiple settings 
and includes research evaluating restaurant menu offerings following local 
menu labeling regulations and in advance of national menu labeling 
regulations
•
There is some evidence that menu labeling lowers calories purchased at 
certain types of restaurants and in cafeteria settings
•
Menu labeling may encourage restaurants to offer lower calorie items, but 
longer-term research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn
