Abstract
BACKGROUND—In the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial, we 
found no significant difference between the stenting group and the endarterectomy group with 
respect to the primary composite end point of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death during the 
periprocedural period or any subsequent ipsilateral stroke during 4 years of follow-up. We now 
extend the results to 10 years.
METHODS—Among patients with carotid-artery stenosis who had been randomly assigned to 
stenting or endarterectomy, we evaluated outcomes every 6 months for up to 10 years at 117 
centers. In addition to assessing the primary composite end point, we assessed the primary end 
point for the long-term extension study, which was ipsilateral stroke after the periprocedural 
period.
RESULTS—Among 2502 patients, there was no significant difference in the rate of the primary 
composite end point between the stenting group (11.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.1 to

 14.8) and the endarterectomy group (9.9%; 95% CI, 7.9 to 12.2) over 10 years of follow-up 
(hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.44). With respect to the primary long-term end point, 
postprocedural ipsilateral stroke over the 10-year follow-up occurred in 6.9% (95% CI, 4.4 to 9.7) 
of the patients in the stenting group and in 5.6% (95% CI, 3.7 to 7.6) of those in the 
endarterectomy group; the rates did not differ significantly between the groups (hazard ratio, 0.99; 
95% CI, 0.64 to 1.52). No significant between-group differences with respect to either end point 
were detected when symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients were analyzed separately.
CONCLUSIONS—Over 10 years of follow-up, we did not find a significant difference between 
patients who underwent stenting and those who underwent endarterectomy with respect to the risk 
of periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction, or death and subsequent ipsilateral stroke. The rate 
of postprocedural ipsilateral stroke also did not differ between groups. (Funded by the National 
Institutes of Health and Abbott Vascular Solutions; CREST ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT00004732.)
We previously reported the outcomes up to 4 years in the Carotid Revascularization 
Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST).1 No significant difference was shown 
between patients assigned to stenting and those assigned to endarterectomy with respect to 
the composite primary end point of periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction, or death 
and subsequent ipsilateral stroke. At baseline, the mean age of the patients was 69 years, and 
at that age the average life expectancy is 15 years for men and 17 years for women.2 As 
such, long-term treatment differences should be central to treatment decisions. We now 
report whether the outcomes after stenting and endarterectomy differed over 10 years of 
follow-up.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN
The study design and methods have been reported previously.3 CREST was a randomized, 
controlled trial with blinded end-point adjudication. The protocol, which is available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was amended to include assessment of treatment 
differences over 10 years of follow-up. Approval of the protocol was obtained by the ethics 
review board at each participating center. The patients provided written informed reconsent 
for extended follow-up up to 10 years.
The authors designed the study, gathered and analyzed the data, wrote the manuscript, and 
made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The authors vouch for the 
completeness and accuracy of the data and analyses and attest to the fidelity of this report to 
the study protocol. Abbott Vascular Solutions contributed devices and funding but did not 
participate in the design of the study or in the preparation or review of the manuscript. 
Abbott Vascular Solutions assisted with site monitoring, including monitoring of all 
Canadian sites.
CENTERS AND PATIENTS
Patients were recruited at 117 centers in the United States and Canada. Certification was 
achieved by 477 surgeons and 224 interventionists.4 Eligible patients could have

 symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Patients were considered to be symptomatic 
if they had had a transient ischemic attack, amaurosis fugax, or minor nondisabling stroke 
involving the ipsilateral carotid artery within 180 days before randomization; eligibility 
criteria for symptomatic patients included stenosis of 50% or more of the diameter of the 
artery on angiography, 70% or more on ultrasonography, or 70% or more on computed 
tomographic angiography or magnetic resonance angiography if the stenosis on 
ultrasonography was 50 to 69%. For asymptomatic patients, eligibility criteria included 
stenosis of 60% or more on angiography, 70% or more on ultrasonography, or 80% or more 
on computed tomographic angiography or magnetic resonance angiography if the stenosis 
on ultrasonography was 50 to 69%. The eligibility criteria have been published previously3 
and are described in the protocol.
TREATMENT
Stenting and endarterectomy were performed according to published guidelines.4–6 Dual 
anti-platelet treatment was initiated before stenting. The RX Acculink stent and, whenever 
feasible, the RX Accunet device to capture and remove emboli (“embolic protection” 
device) were used. After stenting, patients received one or two 325-mg doses of aspirin daily 
for 30 days and either clopidogrel, at a dose of 75 mg daily, or ticlopidine, at a dose of 250 
mg twice daily, for 4 weeks. Patients assigned to endarterectomy received 325 mg of aspirin 
daily before the procedure. All the patients received aspirin at a dose of 80 to 325 mg after 4 
weeks and medical therapy that was consistent with the current standard of care.7
ASCERTAINMENT OF END POINTS
Examination of patients was performed annually and included the administration of the 
Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)–Stroke Questionnaire8 and ultrasonography of the carotid 
artery. A telephone interview, which included the administration of the TIA–Stroke 
Questionnaire, was performed at the 6-month point between the visits, as well as annually 
for patients who were unable to attend the annual visit.
The primary end point of the trial was a composite of any stroke, myocardial infarction, or 
death during the periprocedural period or ipsilateral stroke up to 10 years after 
randomization. We defined the periprocedural period as the period from randomization to 30 
days after the procedure for patients who underwent the procedure within 30 days after 
randomization (i.e., per-protocol treatment). For patients who did not undergo the procedure 
within 30 days, we defined the periprocedural period as the period from randomization to 36 
days after randomization. We chose 36 days because that was the median time after 
randomization for all patients receiving their treatment beyond 30 days. The primary end 
point for the 10-year follow-up study was ipsilateral stroke that occurred after 36 days after 
randomization among patients who had had no periprocedural event.
Study committees whose members were unaware of the treatment assignments adjudicated 
stroke and myocardial infarction. Stroke was defined as an acute neurologic event with 
symptoms and signs, lasting for 24 hours or more, that were consistent with focal cerebral 
ischemia. Stroke was defined as major on the basis of a review of clinical data gathered at 
the time of stroke assessment or if the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score9 was

 9 points or higher (on a scale ranging from 0, indicating no deficit, to 42, consistent with 
quadriplegia and coma) after 90 days.10 Strokes were otherwise considered to be minor. 
Myocardial infarction was defined by a creatine kinase MB or troponin level that was twice 
the upper limit of the normal range or higher, in addition to either chest pain or symptoms 
that were consistent with ischemia or electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia.11
Time to restenosis was defined as the time from the procedure to either ipsilateral 
revascularization or the detection of stenosis of 70 to 99% or occlusion on an 
ultrasonographic examination performed annually after stenting or endarterectomy, with the 
degree of stenosis determined by the norms of the local ultrasonographic laboratory. Control 
of risk factors was assessed at annual visits. Treatment goals for the patients included a low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 100 mg per deciliter (2.60 mmol per liter), a 
systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg, a nonfasting glucose level of less than 200 
mg per deciliter (11.1 mmol per liter), and discontinuation of smoking.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All the analyses except time to restenosis were performed on an intention-to-treat basis; time 
to restenosis was evaluated in a per-protocol analysis that included patients who received 
their assigned treatment within 30 days after randomization. Long-term outcomes were 
assessed with the use of standard survival-analysis techniques including Kaplan–Meier 
survival curves and Cox proportional-hazards models with adjustment for age, sex, and 
symptomatic status. The assessment of differences in the rate of postprocedural ipsilateral 
stroke was performed with the use of similar approaches, but the analysis was restricted to 
patients who did not have a composite end-point event during the periprocedural period.
Event rates were calculated by means of Kaplan–Meier estimation. Because of the relatively 
small number of events, the 95% confidence intervals for the Kaplan–Meier event rates were 
estimated with the use of bootstrap techniques with 10,000 replications, and the 2.5th and 
97.5th percentiles of the sample distribution are reported as the confidence intervals. The 
ratio of event rates with stenting to event rates with endarterectomy was estimated annually. 
The confidence intervals for the annual ratios were also assessed with the use of bootstrap 
methods. We determined whether there were temporal changes in the treatment effect for the 
two primary end points by means of pairwise assessment of differences in the relative risk 
estimated at annual intervals, with the P value calculated by bootstrap methods. Analyses of 
all strokes, nonipsilateral strokes, and life expectancy were not prespecified. Life-table 
approaches were used to calculate life expectancy according to sex and symptomatic status 
at 55, 65, and 75 years of age for the comparison with the general U.S. population (Fig. 
S1A, S1B, and S1C in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org).
RESULTS
STUDY POPULATION AND TREATMENTS
From 2000 through 2008, a total of 2502 patients underwent randomization. The median 
follow-up was 7.4 years. The characteristics of the two groups at baseline were similar, 
except with respect to dyslipidemia (82.9% in the stenting group vs. 85.8% in the

 endarterectomy group, P = 0.05) (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). A diagram 
showing the randomization and follow-up of the study patients is provided in Figure S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Consent for the long-term follow-up was obtained from 1607 patients and was not obtained 
from 895 patients. Of the 895 patients who did not give consent for long-term follow-up, 
195 declined to participate, 276 withdrew from the study, 187 died, 76 completed the initial 
study before the initiation of long-term follow-up, and 161 had a primary composite end-
point event (Table 1, and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients who provided 
consent were significantly more likely than patients who declined to provide consent to have 
asymptomatic stenosis or dyslipidemia but were significantly less likely to have diabetes or 
to be current smokers (Table 1).
During the periprocedural period, the rate of the primary composite end point of stroke, 
death, or myocardial infarction did not differ significantly between the stenting group and 
the endarterectomy group (5.2% and 4.5%, respectively; P = 0.38), although the rates of the 
individual components differed significantly. There were more periprocedural strokes in the 
stenting group than in the endarterectomy group (4.1% vs. 2.3%, P = 0.01), although there 
were significantly fewer periprocedural myocardial infarctions in the stenting group than in 
the endarterectomy group (1.1% vs. 2.3%, P = 0.03) (Table 2).
PRIMARY END POINTS
The 10-year risk of the primary composite end point (any stroke, myocardial infarction, or 
death during the periprocedural period or ipsilateral stroke thereafter) did not differ 
significantly between the stenting group and the endarterectomy group (hazard ratio in the 
stenting group, 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.44; P = 0.51) (Table 2 and Fig. 
1A). At 10 years, the event rates were 11.8% (95% CI, 9.1 to 14.8) in the stenting group and 
9.9% (95% CI, 7.9 to 12.2) in the endarterectomy group (Table 2). There were also no 
significant differences between the stenting group and the endarterectomy group at any other 
year of follow-up between 1 and 9 years (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
There were no significant treatment differences according to symptomatic status (hazard 
ratio among asymptomatic patients in the stenting group, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.52; hazard 
ratio among symptomatic patients in the stenting group, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.66; P = 0.59 
for interaction) (Fig. 2, and Table S3 and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The P 
values for interaction with respect to the primary composite end point were as follows: 0.10 
for the interaction between treatment and age, 0.81 for the interaction between treatment and 
sex, and 0.30 for the interaction between treatment and degree of stenosis; the corresponding 
P values with respect to the end point of stroke or death were 0.12, 0.71, and 0.27 (Fig. 2).
There were no significant differences in the rate of the primary long-term end point — post-
procedural ipsilateral stroke over the 10-year follow-up — between the stenting group and 
the endarterectomy group (6.9% [95% CI, 4.4 to 9.7] and 5.6% [95% CI, 3.7 to 7.6], 
respectively; hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.52) (Table 2). There were 83 
postprocedural strokes, and the risk was similar between patients assigned to stenting (42 
events) and those assigned to endarterectomy (41 events). During the postprocedural period,

 there were nominally more major strokes among patients assigned to stenting than among 
those assigned to endarterectomy (12 events and 6 events, respectively); however, this 
difference was not significant (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 0.71 to 5.10; P = 0.20). In the 
stenting group, the rate of stroke at 5 years was 2.5% (95% CI, 1.2 to 3.7) among 
symptomatic patients and 2.5% (95% CI, 1.1 to 3.8) among asymptomatic patients; the rates 
in the endarterectomy group were 2.7% (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.9) among symptomatic patients 
and 2.7% (95% CI, 1.8 to 4.9) among asymptomatic patients (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
SECONDARY ANALYSES
Stroke or Death—The risk of periprocedural stroke or death and subsequent ipsilateral 
stroke was 37% higher in the stenting group than in the endarterectomy group (hazard ratio, 
1.37; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.86; P = 0.04) (Table 2 and Fig. 1B). The advantage for 
endarterectomy was due primarily to differences in the rates of periprocedural events (Table 
2). Graphs of the event rates stratified according to symptomatic status are provided in 
Figures S3, S4, and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix. Event rates for all stroke and for 
strokes that were ipsilateral or nonipsilateral to the study artery are shown, respectively, in 
Figure 1C and in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Restenosis—No significant difference between the two treatment groups was observed in 
the percentage of patients who had restenosis or underwent revascularization. Restenosis 
occurred or revascularization was performed in 12.2% of the patients treated with stenting 
and in 9.7% of those treated with endarterectomy (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.70) 
(Fig. 3).
Difference in Risk-Factor Control—We observed significant improvements from 
baseline in the control of most risk factors across the follow-up, with control of lipid levels 
increasing from 59.2% of patients at baseline to 80.7% at 120 months, control of blood 
pressure increasing from 51.6% to 60.5%, glucose control increasing from 74.8% to 80.2%, 
and smoking cessation increasing from 74.3% to 86.9% (Table S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Significant treatment differences were limited to glucose control at 72 months 
(81.5% in the stenting group vs. 74.8% in the endarterectomy group, P = 0.03) and to 
smoking cessation at 12 months (76.9% vs. 81.0%, P = 0.03), at 48 months (78.1% vs. 
86.3%, P = 0.002), and at 96 months (81.5% vs. 86.7%, P = 0.05).
LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR STUDY PATIENTS AND THE GENERAL U.S. POPULATION
Among persons 65 years of age, life expectancy was estimated to be 18 years for men and 
20 years for women in the United States.12 Life expectancy was estimated to be 
approximately 2 years shorter for men and 1 year shorter for women in CREST, regardless 
of symptomatic or asymptomatic status, than for men and women in the general U.S. 
population (Fig. S1A, S1B, and S1C in the Supplementary Appendix).

 DISCUSSION
Because life expectancy has increased in the elderly and has been similar for the patients in 
CREST,12 results regarding long-term outcomes after stenting and endarterectomy are 
needed to guide treatment decisions. In CREST, including up to 10 years of follow-up, we 
did not find significant differences in the primary composite end point of periprocedural 
stroke, myocardial infarction, or death and subsequent ipsilateral stroke between patients — 
including both men and women and both those with symptomatic and those with 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis — who underwent carotid-artery stenting and those who 
underwent carotid endarterectomy. In addition, there were no significant differences in the 
durability of the procedures as assessed by the primary long-term end point of 
postprocedural ipsilateral stroke. We did not detect significant between-group differences in 
either the primary composite end point or the primary long-term end point when the end 
points were analyzed according to symptomatic status, age, sex, or degree of stenosis.
The absolute rates were less than 7% across the postprocedural stroke end points in our trial, 
a finding that contrasts with results of previous randomized trials of surgical and medical 
treatments in symptomatic patients13,14 and asymptomatic patients.15,16 For example, in the 
stenting group, the 10-year estimated rate of postprocedural stroke was 6.9% among both 
symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients. In comparison, the rate of any 
postprocedural stroke at 5 years was 22.3% after endarterectomy in the North American 
Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial13 and 16.9% at 10 years in the Asymptomatic 
Carotid Surgery Trial.16 In addition, the postprocedural rates of ipsilateral-vessel and 
nonipsilateral-vessel stroke were strikingly similar regardless of the revascularization 
approach, a finding that implies that successful revascularization attenuates the contribution 
of ipsilateral carotid artery disease to the risk of stroke.
Over the 10-year follow-up, patients who were assigned to stenting had a higher risk of 
stroke or death than did those assigned to endarterectomy. However, no significant 
difference was detected in the rate of postprocedural stroke between the stenting group and 
the endarterectomy group. Hence, the higher risks of stroke or death and of stroke at 10 
years appear to be attributable to the periprocedural differences in risk that were reported 
previously.1 With respect to stenting, proximal embolic protection and mesh-covered stents 
are under development.17,18 These and other anticipated advancements may lower the rates 
of periprocedural stroke. With respect to endarterectomy, advances in preoperative cardiac 
evaluation, anesthesia, and quality improvement may also reduce the risk of perioperative 
complications.19
In an analysis of symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients separately, we found no 
significant differences according to treatment group in the primary composite end point or in 
the rate of postprocedural stroke over the 10-year follow-up. The rates of postprocedural 
ipsilateral stroke and all postprocedural stroke were strikingly similar in asymptomatic 
patients and symptomatic patients at 5 years and at 10 years, regardless of the 
revascularization method. This finding implies that symptomatic status is of relevance in the 
context of periprocedural risk but ceases to be a useful characterization of patients at 5 years 
and 10 years after revascularization.

 The long-term follow-up results of several other randomized trials comparing stenting with 
endarterectomy have been reported.20–22 In the International Carotid Stenting Study 
(ICSS),22 patients were followed for a median of 4.2 years for the primary end point of fatal 
or disabling stroke in any vascular territory. The 5-year cumulative risk observed in ICSS 
was 6.4% in the stenting group and 6.5% in the endarterectomy group (hazard ratio, 1.06; 
95% CI, 0.72 to 1.57; P = 0.77) — a result similar to that in CREST. In the Asymptomatic 
Carotid Trial (ACT I), the results of which are also reported in the Journal,23 carotid-artery 
stenting was noninferior to carotid endarterectomy with respect to the primary composite 
end point of death, stroke, and myocardial infarction within 30 days after the procedure plus 
ipsilateral stroke within 1 year after the procedure, and there was no significant difference in 
the composite end point in an analysis that included up to 5 years of follow-up.
The long-term results of CREST may help guide the treatment of patients with carotid artery 
disease. Emphasis should be given to reducing periprocedural risk with both stenting and 
endarterectomy. In the case of stenting, more than half the ipsilateral-vessel strokes over a 
10-year period occurred within the first month. Nonetheless, at centers with experienced 
interventionists and surgeons who have verifiable good outcomes, as verified during 
certification in CREST,4 the rates of periprocedural complications were relatively low with 
stenting and with endarterectomy. Both procedures were associated with rates of stroke that 
were less than 7% over a 10-year period. Decision making is more challenging at centers 
where interventional and surgical expertise cannot be verified. Several studies of 
administrative databases24 have shown higher rates of periprocedural stroke or death after 
stenting than those reported in CREST and ICSS.22
Advances in the long-term treatment of atherosclerosis, combined with longer life 
expectancy, mean that reassessment of the role of carotid artery intervention in patients with 
asymptomatic carotid-artery stenosis and in those with milder but symptomatic carotid-
artery stenosis is warranted. Although, by design, CREST did not assess a parallel medical 
group, the ongoing Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic 
Carotid Stenosis Trial (CREST-2; Clinical Trials.gov number, NCT02089217) is addressing 
the question of the relative benefits of revascularization over nonrevascularization in 
asymptomatic patients in the context of modern intensive medical therapy. The European 
Carotid Surgery Trial 2 (ECST-2; Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN97744893) is 
also comparing revascularization with nonrevascularization in asymptomatic patients and 
includes symptomatic patients who have been deemed at low risk for stroke.
In conclusion, the long-term follow-up results of CREST did not show significant 
differences between carotid-artery stenting and carotid endarterectomy with respect to the 
primary composite end point of periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction, or death and 
postprocedural ipsilateral stroke over a time period that was appropriate for elderly 
asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients with severe carotid artery disease. In 
addition, there was no evidence of a significant difference in the long-term durability of 
stenting and endarterectomy to prevent stroke during the postprocedural period. Restenosis 
was infrequent after either procedure.

 Figure 1. Cumulative Proportions of Patients with the Primary Composite End Point, Stroke or 
Death, and Any Stroke, According to Treatment Group
Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of event rates for the primary end point (a composite of 
stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from any cause during the periprocedural period or 
ipsilateral stroke within 10 years after randomization) (Panel A), any stroke or death during 
the periprocedural period or ipsilateral stroke afterward (Panel B), and any stroke (regardless 
of relationship with the target artery) (Panel C). The curves are shown separately for patients 
who were randomly assigned to carotid-artery stenting and those who were randomly 
assigned to carotid endarterectomy. Insets show the same data on an enlarged y axis.

Hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals are shown for the primary composite 
end point of any stroke, death, or myocardial infarction during the periprocedural period 
plus ipsilateral stroke within 10 years after randomization (Panel A) and for any stroke or 
death during the periprocedural period plus ipsilateral stroke within 10 years after 
randomization (Panel B). Severe stenosis was defined as stenosis of at least 70% of the 
diameter of the artery, and moderate stenosis as less than 70%. The sizes of the boxes are

 Figure 3. Estimated Rate of Restenosis
Restenosis was defined by the first observation of stenosis of 70% or more of the diameter of 
the artery on duplex ultrasonography or by ipsilateral revascularization. Ultrasonography 
was performed at annual visits, and therefore a restenosis reported at year 1 was observed at 
the 1-year clinic visit (which was performed within a 30-day window). The inset shows the 
same data on an enlarged y axis.

*The periprocedural period was defined, according to the study protocol, as the 30-day period after the procedure (for all patients who underwent the assigned procedure within 30 days after randomization) 
or the 36-day period after randomization (for all patients who did not undergo the assigned procedure within 30 days after randomization). The analysis of the periprocedural period plus 10-year follow-up 
was based on data for all the patients. The postprocedural-only period excluded patients who had a composite end-point event during the periprocedural period or who withdrew during the periprocedural 
period; the number of periprocedural events plus the number of postprocedural events therefore do not add up to the total. The primary end point was a composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death 
from any cause during the periprocedural period or ipsilateral stroke within 10 years after randomization. One patient in the stenting group and one in the endarterectomy group had a stroke after a 
periprocedural myocardial infarction; these two strokes are not included in the stroke end point in the postprocedural-only period. Among the patients assigned to endarterectomy, one patient had a minor 
stroke during the periprocedural period and a major stroke during the postprocedural period and is therefore included in the stroke end point for both major stroke and minor stroke. Hazard ratios are for the 
10-year period and were adjusted for age, symptomatic status, and sex. P values were calculated on the basis of the significance of the hazard ratio (per the study protocol). Patients may have had more than 
one event (e.g., fatal stroke was counted as both a death and a stroke, patients may have had an ipsilateral stroke followed by a nonipsilateral stroke, and patients may have had a minor stroke followed by a 
major stroke).
