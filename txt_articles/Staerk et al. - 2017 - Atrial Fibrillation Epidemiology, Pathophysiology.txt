T
he association of an irregular pulse and mitral stenosis 
was first described by Robert Adams in 1827, but it was 
not until the turn of the 20th century when William Einthoven 
invented electrocardiography that atrial fibrillation (AF) was 
first recorded on the ECG.1 Its pathogenesis and clinical im-
portance gained enhanced appreciation in the 1990s when ear-
ly community-based studies, including the FHS (Framingham 
Heart Study),2–4 provided critical epidemiological data on as-
sociated risk factors (RFs) and clinical outcomes. These asso-
ciations empowered scientists and clinicians by focusing their 
attention on specific disease models. Over the past 3 decades, 
an explosion of research has yielded progress in the clini-
cal treatment of AF at a time when AF is reaching epidemic 
proportions.
Our review provides an overview of the pathogenesis of 
nonvalvular AF and a comprehensive examination of the epi-
demiological data associating various RFs with AF (Figure 1). 
For each RF, we highlight key population studies supporting 
its association and critically review data on how the RF may 
lead to the development of the AF substrate and AF genesis. 
Last, we review clinical outcomes associated with AF and 
discuss possible mechanisms linking these associations. Our 
review focuses on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of 
AF rather than its clinical treatment.
Pathophysiology and Natural History AF
AF is characterized by high-frequency excitation of the atrium 
that results in both dyssynchronous atrial contraction and ir-
regularity of ventricular excitation. Whereas AF may occur in 
the absence of known structural or electrophysiological ab-
normalities, epidemiological association studies are increas-
ingly identifying comorbid conditions, many of which have 
been shown to cause structural and histopathologic changes 
that form a unique AF substrate or atrial cardiomyopathy.5
AF Initiation: Ectopic Firing
The prevailing hypothesis of AF genesis is that rapid trigger-
ing initiates propagating reentrant waves in a vulnerable atrial 
substrate. The relative importance of the initiating trigger may 
decrease because the AF substrate progresses and AF becomes 
more stabilized. Haïssaguerre et al6 first identified focal ectopic 
firing arising from myocyte sleeves within the pulmonary veins

Abstract: The past 3 decades have been characterized by an exponential growth in knowledge and advances in the 
clinical treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). It is now known that AF genesis requires a vulnerable atrial substrate 
and that the formation and composition of this substrate may vary depending on comorbid conditions, genetics, 
sex, and other factors. Population-based studies have identified numerous factors that modify the atrial substrate 
and increase AF susceptibility. To date, genetic studies have reported 17 independent signals for AF at 14 genomic 
regions. Studies have established that advanced age, male sex, and European ancestry are prominent AF risk 
factors. Other modifiable risk factors include sedentary lifestyle, smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, obstructive 
sleep apnea, and elevated blood pressure predispose to AF, and each factor has been shown to induce structural 
and electric remodeling of the atria. Both heart failure and myocardial infarction increase risk of AF and vice versa 
creating a feed-forward loop that increases mortality. Other cardiovascular outcomes attributed to AF, including 
stroke and thromboembolism, are well established, and epidemiology studies have championed therapeutics that 
mitigate these adverse outcomes. However, the role of anticoagulation for preventing dementia attributed to AF is 
less established. Our review is a comprehensive examination of the epidemiological data associating unmodifiable 
and modifiable risk factors for AF and of the pathophysiological evidence supporting the mechanistic link between 
each risk factor and AF genesis. Our review also critically examines the epidemiological data on clinical outcomes 
attributed to AF and summarizes current evidence linking each outcome with AF.

(PVs) in patients with paroxysmal AF; ablation of these ectopic 
foci reduced AF burden, demonstrating their role in AF genesis 
(Figure 2A). It is now known that the PVs have unique elec-
tric properties and a complex fiber architecture that promote 
reentry and ectopic activity to initiate AF.7 Autopsy studies 
have identified pacemaker cells, transitional cells, and Purkinje 
cells within the PVs.8 The molecular basis for PV triggers has 
been primarily attributed to abnormal calcium Ca2+ handling. 
A diastolic leak of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum acti-
vates an inward Na+ current via Na+Ca2+ exchanger resulting in 
spontaneous myocyte depolarization (early or delayed afterde-
polarization). Hyperphosphorylation of key regulatory proteins 
and enzymes, including protein kinase A, calmodulin kinase II, 
phospholamban, and the ryanodine receptor type 2, is impor-
tant contributors to sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ overload and 
diastolic membrane instability.9,10 A reentrant mechanism for 
PV triggers also has been described. Decremental conduction 
and repolarization heterogeneity within the PV enable local-
ized reentry and may foster a focal driver for AF.11
AF Perpetuation: Reentry
Whereas triggers are required for AF initiation, a vulnerable 
atrial substrate is equally important. Structural, architectural, 
and electrophysiological atrial abnormalities promote the per-
petuation of AF by stabilizing reentry. The mechanism of reen-
try in AF remains controversial with 2 dominant hypotheses, 
including reentrant rotors12,13 or multiple independent wave-
lets (Figure 2B through 2E).14 Advances in electroanatomic 
mapping and ablation technologies have yielded increasing 
evidence supporting the former mechanism.15,16 Recent data 
supporting a third hypothesis, the double layer hypothesis, 
suggest that electric dissociation of epicardial and endocardial 
layers also may facilitate reentry (Figure 2D).17,18
For perpetuation of functional reentry, the propagating 
wavefront must complete 1 circus movement in a time peri-
od long enough for atrial tissue within that circuit to recover 
excitability (effective refractory period [ERP]). Thus, slow 
conduction velocity and a short ERP promote reentry. Both 
reduce wavelength size increasing the likelihood of multiple 
simultaneous reentrant circuits and AF perpetuation.
Atrial substrates that promote reentry are characterized by 
abnormalities of the atrial cardiomyocyte, fibrotic changes, 
and alterations in the interstitial matrix with primarily non-
collagen deposits.5 These molecular and histological changes 
impair normal anisotropic conduction (fibrosis and reduced 
cell coupling) and may shorten atrial ERP. For example, in 
familial AF, congenital abnormalities that lead to a gain in 
K+ channel function shorten ERP of atrial cardiomyocytes, 
whereas, in heart failure (HF), a combination of atrial fibro-
sis and alterations in cardiomyocyte function results in both a 
slowing of conduction velocity and shortening of ERP. Thus, 
the development of and characterization of the vulnerable atri-
al substrate is specific to the predisposing AF RF.
Natural History
For decades, the prevailing notion was that AF began with 
paroxysmal episodes that increased in frequency and duration 
causing progression to more persistent AF subtypes. This so-
called AF begets AF postulate was based on early experimental 
data in goats, showing that tachycardia induces electrophysi-
ological atrial remodeling resulting in persistence of AF.19 
Regional heterogeneity and shortening of the atrial ERP20,21 
occur within 30 minutes of tachycardia onset and are a re-
sult of adaptation to intracellular Ca2+ overload.22 In the FHS, 
only 10% of participants remained free of AF 2 years after 
incident AF, and recurrent (26%) or sustained AF (34%) was 
common.23 But other studies suggest that this abiding notion 
is not ubiquitous. In the CARAF (Canadian Registry of Atrial 
Fibrillation), progression of paroxysmal AF to more persis-
tent (chronic) AF subtype was 8.6% at 1 year and 24.7% by 
5 years.24 The Euro Heart Survey followed 5333 patients with 
AF for 1 year and found that 80% of patients with paroxysmal 
AF remained paroxysmal, whereas 30% of patients with per-
sistent AF progressed to permanent.25 Studies in patients with 
pacemakers allow for more robust assessment of AF burden 
and have shown that the majority of patients (54%–76%) with 
paroxysmal AF remain paroxysmal.26,27 One study showed 
that only 24% of patients with paroxysmal AF progressed to 
persistent AF in 1 year and that there was a progressive pattern 
of increasing arrhythmia burden in these patients except in the 
days before the development of persistent AF supporting the 
mechanism of tachy-mediated atrial remodeling.27
The most remarkable observation is that persistent AF may 
spontaneously switch to paroxysmal subtype,26 highlighting the 
complex natural history of AF, the limitations of experimental 
data, and the existing uncertainty in the mechanisms and factors 
that govern the clinical course of AF. In addition, the natural his-
tory of AF may change over time because the RFs contributing 
to AF onset shift in prevalence and severity (eg, less smoking 
and lower blood pressures, higher prevalence of obesity), and 
primary (eg, better hypertension control) and secondary (anti-
coagulation) prevention treatments evolve.28 Finally, the means

population studies is inconsistent leading to ascertainment bias 
and challenges in predicting the natural history of AF subtypes.
RFs for Developing AF
Unmodifiable RFs
Genetics
Epidemiology
Near the start of the millennium, rare familial forms of AF 
were identified, and loci were mapped to 10q22-24,29 6q14-
16,30 and 11p15-5.31 Subsequent population-based studies 
showed that family history of AF is associated with a 40% 
increased risk of first-degree relatives developing AF.32,33 The 
recognition of the heritability of AF in the general population 
has propelled the search for associated genetic loci.34
Classic Mendelian genetics and candidate gene approach-
es have been used to define the familial basis of AF. To date, 
at least 15 AF-causing mutations in K+ channel genes or ac-
cessory subunit have been identified,34 including mutations in 
ABCC9 (IKATP), HCN4 (If), KCNA5 (IKur), KCND3 (IKs), KCNE1 
(IKs), KCNE2 (IKs), KCNE3 (IKs), KCNE4 (IKs), KCNE5 (IKs), 
KCNH2 (IKr), KCNJ2 (IK1), KCNJ5 (IKAch), KCNJ8 (IKATP), 
KCNN3 (IAHP), and KCNQ1 (IKs). Gain-of-function mutations

increase repolarizing K+ current shortening the action poten-
tial duration (APD) and atrial refractoriness. Loss-of-function 
mutations delay repolarization and promote Ca2+ mediated 
afterdepolarization that triggers AF.35,36 Six variations in Na+ 
channel genes have been identified, and these include SCN1B, 
SCN2B, SCN3B, SCN4B, SCN5A, and SCN10A.34 Gain-of-
function mutations may increase AF vulnerability by increas-
ing cellular hyperexcitability,37 whereas loss-of-function 
mutations shorten ERP and slow conduction.38 Other impor-
tant AF-causing genetic variants include mutations in the gap 
junctional protein-coding gene GJA5 that diminishes cell–cell 
coupling and promotes reentry by slowing conduction veloc-
ity and shortening the wavelength.39
Instead of isolating a specific AF-causing gene, genome-
wide association studies seek to scan the entire genome for 
disease-related genetic variants in single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs). The first genome-wide association study for 
AF identified SNP rs2200733 located on chromosome 4q25 
upstream of PITX2 in an Icelandic population, which was 
strongly replicated in samples from Sweden, United States, 
and Hong Kong.40 A meta-analysis of 3 AF susceptibility loci 
(4q25, 1q21, and 16q22) showed that the chromosome 4q25 
SNP rs2200733 was associated with 30% increased risk of 
recurrent atrial tachycardia after AF ablation.41 In a separate 
meta-analysis, this locus was associated with 38% increased 
risk of cardioembolic stroke.42
In experimental mouse models, the Pitx2 gene encodes a 
transcription factor important for the embryonic organogen-
esis of the asymmetrical organs placed in the left side, includ-
ing the heart.43 Moreover, Pitx2c is involved in the formation 
of the PV muscle sleeves,44 the most common site of triggered 
activity in AF. Loss of function of Pitx2c gene plays a role in 
the development of AF, and the differentiation, proliferation, 
and expansion of pulmonary myocardial cells.45,46
In separate genome-wide association studies, the SNP 
rs2106261 near gene ZFHX3 identified on locus 16q22 was 
associated with increased AF risk. A knockdown of ZFHX3 
dysregulates Ca2+, shortens the APD, and promotes arrhyth-
mia susceptibility.47
AFGen consortium was formed in 2008 to increase statis-
tical power for identifying loci associated with AF.48 To date, 
17 independent susceptibility signals for AF at 14 genomic 
regions have been identified. These include KCNN3, PRRX1, 
CAV1, SYNE2, C9orf3, HCN4, and MYOZ1.49,50 The identifi-
cation of genes related to AF is still in an early stage but in the 
future may allow for the assessment of an individuals’ AF risk 
and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets.
Age
Epidemiology
Advancing age is the most prominent RF for AF.28 
Understanding the influence of age on AF risk is important for 
assessing how changes in life expectancy will affect the preva-
lence of AF.
Although the prevalence of AF varies among different 
ethnic populations, epidemiological studies have consistently 
found a stepwise increase in the prevalence of AF with ad-
vancing age.51–53 For example, a population-based multicenter 
cohort study reported age-specific rates in individuals aged 65 
to 74 and 75 to 84 years of 3.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.4–7.0) and 8.6 (95% CI, 4.6–14.9) for Chinese, 4.9 (95% 
CI, 3.1–7.3) and 10.6 (95% CI, 7.2–15.1) for non-Hispanic 
blacks, 7.3 (95% CI, 4.7–10.7) and 9.4 (95% CI, 5.9–14.4) for 
Hispanics, and 13.4 (95% CI, 10.6–16.7) and 19.6 (95% CI, 
15.6–24.3) for non-Hispanic whites, respectively.51
The incidence of AF also increases with advancing age. 
In a Scottish study, the incidence rates per 1000 person-years 
was 0.5 for age 45 to 54 years, 1.1 for age 55 to 64, 3.2 for 
age 65 to 74, 6.2 for age 75 to 84, and 7.7 for age ≥85 years.53
The FHS examined temporal trends in AF RFs. During 
the past 5 decades, age was observed to be the greatest RF 
for AF when compared with other RFs, including male sex, 
body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol 
consumption, systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, 
left ventricular hypertrophy, heart murmur, HF, and myocar-
dial infarction (MI).28 In the most recent time period studied 
(1998–2007), participant age of 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 
to 89 years was associated with 4.98-, 7.35-, and 9.33-fold 
risk of AF, respectively, compared with individuals aged 50 
to 59 years.28 Accordingly, a stepwise increment in age has 
been incorporated in AF risk prediction scores.54,55 Among AF 
patients, those with age <65 years also have been found to be 
healthier, have a different AF RF profile, and less in-hospital 
deaths compared with those age ≥65 years.56
Sex Differences
Epidemiology
There is now greater recognition that epidemiology of AF differs 
between men and women.57 The age-adjusted incidence of AF 
is higher in men compared with women in North American and 
European populations. In the FHS, the AF incidence (per 1000 
person-years) was 3.8 in men and 1.6 in women.28 The Olmsted 
County Minnesota Study58 and the Rotterdam Study59 reported 
the AF incidence (per 1000 person-years) in men to be 4.7 and 
11.5, respectively, compared with 2.7 and 8.9 in women. A high-
er incidence of AF in men also is observed in Asian populations, 
although less data are available.60,61 Similarly, the age-adjusted 
prevalence of AF is higher in men than in women in North 
American and European populations. Among the Medicare ben-
eficiaries of adults aged ≥65 years, the prevalence was 10.3% in 
men and 7.4% in women.62 The higher prevalence of AF in men 
is also observed globally in both high-income and low- and mid-
dle-income countries.60 However, there are less consistent data in 
Asian countries with some studies showing higher prevalence in 
men,61,63,64 whereas others showed no sex difference.52,65,66
In North American and European populations, the life-
time risk for AF is similar between men and women despite 
higher AF incidence in men owing to their shorter life expec-
tancy.57 The FHS reported that the lifetime risks to develop AF 
at age 40 years were 26% for men and 23% for women.67 In 
the Rotterdam Study, the lifetime risks at age 55 years were 
23.8% for men and 22.2% for women.59 On the contrary, 
among Chinese adults, the lifetime risk was consistently lower 
in men compared with women across all age groups.52
Underlying RFs of AF and taller stature in men largely ex-
plain higher AF incidence in men.57 The CHARGE-AF con-
sortium reported that after adjusting for AF-related RFs, male 
sex was no longer an independent RF for AF.54 The population

attributable risks of the RFs for AF differ by sex.57 The popu-
lation attributable risk for AF of coronary disease is higher in 
men,2 whereas the population attributable risks of elevated sys-
tolic blood pressure57 and valvular disease2 are higher in women.
Racial Differences
Epidemiology
Many of the early population-based studies in AF were limited 
by racial diversity. However, in the last decade, there has been a 
determined initiative to better understand the racial and ethnic 
differences in AF prevalence, pathophysiology, and outcomes.
Numerous studies demonstrated that AF is less prevalent 
in individuals of African when compared with European an-
cestry.51,68–72 These data seem counterintuitive given the higher 
prevalence of traditional AF RFs in blacks than whites.68,73 
The Candidate Gene Association Resource Study68 found that 
among blacks, the risk of AF was independently associated 
with increasing percentage of European ancestry (hazard ratio 
[HR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03–1.23). Adjusted associations showed 
that with every 10% increase in European ancestry, there was a 
16% to 20% increased risk of AF. The data are consistent with 
the hypothesis that either African ancestry has protective effect 
against AF or European ancestry enhances AF susceptibility.
Candidate SNP analysis performed in 2 cohorts showed 
that the rs10824026 SNP located on the 10q22 genetic locus 
accounted for 11.4% to 31.7% increased AF risk in white indi-
viduals when compared with blacks.74 Furthermore, the minor 
allele G of the SNP confers low AF risk49 and is more com-
mon in blacks (37.7%–37.8%) when compared with white in-
dividuals (15.5%–16.4%).74 In a separate study that combined 
3 cohorts with European and black descent, an intronic SNP 
rs4845625 of the IL6R gene was associated with AF in white 
individuals (relative risk, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.85–0.95) and in 
blacks (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72–1.03 with borderline 
significance P=0.09).75 Finally, the SNP rs4611994 on chro-
mosome 4 near PITX2 was associated with AF risk in blacks 
(HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.16–1.69), and this chromosomal locus 
is associated with AF in white individuals.40 Although tradi-
tional AF RFs are well recognized, there are increasing data 
that race, ethnicity, and attributed genetic ancestral variants 
may play a significant role in modulating AF susceptibility.
More 
recently, 
the 
MESA 
(Multi-Ethnic 
Study 
of 
Atherosclerosis) reported the prevalence of AF in Hispanic and 
Asians residing in the United States. The age- and sex-adjust-
ed incidence rates per 1000 person-years of AF were 6.1 in 
Hispanics and 3.9 in Asians when compared with 11.2 in white 
and 5.8 in black individuals.51 These data are comparable to 
The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project that reported that 
Hispanics and Asians had multivariable-adjusted lower risk 
of AF (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.77–0.79) when compared with 
whites.73 Both studies showed that a larger proportion of AF in 
nonwhites was attributed to the greater presence of traditional 
RFs particularly hypertension when compared with whites.
Modifiable RFs
Physical Activity and Sedentary Lifestyle
Epidemiology
The relationship between level of physical activity and risk of 
AF has been described as nonlinear.76–78 Sedentary lifestyle is 
associated with higher risk of AF,79 but paradoxically extreme 
levels of physical activity also are associated with increased 
AF risk.80–82
A large retrospective cohort study of 64 561 patients 
showed a graded and inverse relationship between cardiore-
spiratory fitness as objectively assessed with treadmill testing. 
The incidence rate of AF in patients with lowest cardiorespira-
tory fitness was 18.8% when compared with 3.7% in those with 
highest cardiorespiratory fitness. Every 1-MET increase in car-
diorespiratory fitness was associated with a dose dependent 7% 
reduction in AF risk.83 A meta-analysis of pooled data from 
7 studies showed that sedentary lifestyle was associated with 
increased risk of AF (odds ratio [OR], 2.47; 95% CI, 1.25–3.7) 
compared with moderate or intense physical activity.82
Interesting and seemingly contradictory male endur-
ance athletes are at increased AF risk. In a prospective case– 
control study, individuals who had performed <2000 hours of 
lifetime-accumulated high-intensity exercise had an attenu-
ated risk of lone AF (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.12–0.98) when 
compared with sedentary individuals. But the AF risk in those 
with ≥2000 hours of high-intensity exercise was increased 
(OR, 3.88; 95% CI, 1.55–9.73).76 The type of exercise modu-
lates AF risk with endurance sports, such as marathon run-
ning76 or long-distance cross-country skiing,80 conferring 
the highest AF risk. A meta-analysis showed that there was 
over a 5-fold increased risk of AF in athletes than nonathlete 
referents.84
Sex differences in the association of physical activity with 
AF have been identified. In men, a U-shaped association of 
AF risk and physical activity was observed where moderate 
physical activity was found to confer lowest risk (OR, 0.81; 
95% CI, 0.26–1.00) and intense activity conferred the highest 
risk (OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.97–4.63). In women, however, the 
association was inverse and linear. Increasing physical activity 
was associated with progressive and decreasing AF risk with 
ORs of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.77–0.97) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.57–
0.88) for moderate and intense activity, respectively.82
Pathophysiology
Sedentary lifestyle is known to increase risk of AF RFs, in-
cluding hypertension,85 obesity,85 and diabetes mellitus.86 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in obese individu-
als and has been associated with sedentary lifestyle.87 These 
conditions have been shown to independently induce struc-
tural and electric remodeling of the atrium. Physical inactiv-
ity also increases systemic inflammation,88 which may induce 
atrial remodeling and has been associated with AF.89–93 Finally, 
sedentary lifestyle is associated with autonomic dysfunction 
and elevated sympathetic tone, which enhances afterdepolar-
ization triggering and AF susceptibility.
In endurance athletes, the pathogenesis of AF has been at-
tributed to 2 primary mechanisms. First, increased vagal tone 
in these individuals82,94 may shorten and increase the disper-
sion of atrial ERP promoting PV firing and localized reentry. 
Second, long-term endurance training causes progressive car-
diac remodeling, including left atrial enlargement, which may 
promote AF.95–97 Atrial fibrosis and increased AF susceptibil-
ity has been observed in a rat model of prolonged, intensive 
exercise.98

Smoking
Epidemiology
Smoking is associated with incident AF.54,99 The FHS showed 
that within the past 50 years, the frequency of smoking among 
participants with new-onset AF has decreased. Between 1998 
and 2007, only 12.7% of AF-affected participants were smok-
ers when compared with 15.6% in the previous decade.28
The Rotterdam Study found that both former and current 
smoking were equally associated with increased AF risk.100 In 
the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study), 
the multivariable-adjusted incidence of AF was 1.58× higher 
in ever smokers (former and current) and 2-fold higher (HR, 
2.05) in current smokers when compared with nonsmokers.99 
A dose–response association was observed with increasing 
cigarette-years.99 In the CHARGE-AF consortium, incident 
AF was 1.44× higher in current smokers when compared with 
nonsmokers.54 Smoking is an RF for AF across various races 
and ethnicities.54,99,101
Finally, secondhand tobacco exposure also has been as-
sociated with risk of AF.102 Exposure during gestational devel-
opment or early childhood is associated with ≈40% increased 
risk of AF.103
Pathophysiology
Smoking is thought to increase AF susceptibility through in-
direct and direct mechanisms. Smoking may increase myo-
cardial ischemia by increasing systemic catecholamine and 
myocardial work, reducing oxygen carrying capacity, and 
promoting coronary vasoconstriction.104 In addition, smoking 
accelerates atherosclerosis through effects on lipids, endothe-
lial function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and thrombo-
sis.105 These effects may indirectly increase AF susceptibility 
by predisposing to atrial ischemia, MI, and HF. Reduced lung 
function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also in-
crease vulnerability to AF.106
Smoking and nicotine also have been shown to directly con-
tribute to the AF substrate. In a case–control study of patients 
undergoing coronary artery bypass, the volume of atrial fibrosis 
in smokers was shown to be dose dependent, and in nonsmokers, 
nicotine was shown to induce a pattern of collagen type III ex-
pression in atrial tissue culture that was similar to that observed 
in smokers.107 In a dog model, nicotine induced interstitial fibro-
sis and increased AF susceptibility.108 The profibrotic effect of 
nicotine was attributed to downregulation of atrial microRNAs, 
miR-133, and miR-590, which in turn increased transforming 
growth factors-b1 and -b2 and connective tissue growth factor. 
Finally, nicotine prolongs the APD by blocking the inward rec-
tifier potassium channel (Ik1 and Kirs)109 and reduces the transient 
outward potassium current (Ito).110 Prolongation in the APD may 
increase arrhythmia susceptibility, but the proarrhythmic effect 
of nicotine has not been confirmed.
Obesity
Epidemiology
Both obesity and elevated BMI predispose to established AF 
RFs, including hypertension,111 diabetes mellitus,112 MI,113 left 
ventricular hypertrophy,114 left atrial enlargement,115 left ven-
tricular diastolic dysfunction,116 HF,117 and OSA.2 However, 
when accounting for these concomitant conditions, population 
studies show that obesity and elevated BMI independently in-
crease risk for AF.
Numerous population-based studies have shown an asso-
ciation between elevated BMI and increased risk of AF.118–120 
A meta-analyses of 5 studies found that obesity confers a 49% 
increased risk of developing AF.121 A dose–response relation-
ship was observed with each 1 U increase in BMI associated 
with a 3% to 4.7% increase in AF risk.118,122,123 Other measures 
of obesity, including abdominal circumference and total fat 
mass, have been associated with 13% to 16% increase in AF 
risk per 1 SD over 10-year follow-up.124 Importantly, obesity 
is a powerful predictor of incident AF even when regression 
analyses have been adjusted for OSA, which commonly coex-
ists in such patients.123
Pathophysiology
Excess AF risk associated with obesity has been attributed to 
left atrial enlargement,118 increased left ventricular mass,114 
and diastolic dysfunction.116,125,126 In a sheep model of obe-
sity, increasing weight correlated with increased left atrial 
volume and pressure, ventricular mass, and pericardial fat. 
Histological analysis revealed that myocardial lipidosis, fibro-
sis, and inflammatory infiltrates increased progressively with 
increasing weight. These pathological changes were associ-
ated with decreased conduction velocity and increased AF.127 
Whereas no change in atrial ERP was observed in the sheep 
model, a clinical study of 63 patients undergoing PV isolation 
reported that elevated BMI was associated with short atrial 
ERP and slower atrial conduction velocity,128 properties that 
promote reentry.
Pericardial fat also has been implicated in the pathogen-
esis of the obesity–AF relation. Cross-sectional studies have 
shown that pericardial fat is associated with prevalence, se-
verity, and recurrence of AF.129,130 A recent meta-analysis of 
23 studies correlated epicardial adipose tissue with AF after 
adjusting for traditional RFs (OR, 1.47 per SD epicardial adi-
pose tissue increase; 95% CI, 1.17–1.84).131 A local paracrine 
effect of epicardial adipose tissue mediated by inflammatory 
cytokines,132 growth and remodeling factors,133 angiogenic fac-
tors, and adipocytokines may lead to the development of the AF 
substrate.133,134 Epicardial adipose tissue location on CT imag-
ing correlates with high dominant excitation frequency during 
electroanatomic mapping in patients undergoing AF ablation.135
Diabetes Mellitus
Epidemiology
The FHS showed that men and women with diabetes mellitus 
had a 40% and 60% increased risk of AF, respectively.2 Level 
of blood glucose may be more predictive than actual diagnosis 
of diabetes mellitus in older adults.136 A meta-analysis of co-
hort and case–control studies found that patients with diabetes 
mellitus or impaired glucose homeostasis had a 34% greater 
risk of AF than individuals without diabetes mellitus.137 A 
causal association is supported by evidence that worse gly-
cemic control and longer duration of diabetes mellitus are as-
sociated with increased AF risk.138 The estimated risk of AF 
increases by 3% per additional year of diabetes mellitus. The 
risk of AF in patients with diabetes mellitus for >10 years was 
64% but only 7% in those with diabetes mellitus ≤5 years.

 Staerk et al  Atrial Fibrillation: Epidemiology and Pathophysiology  1507
Pathophysiology
Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance seem to mediate the 
development of the AF substrate.139 The molecular mechanism 
by which insulin resistance alters cardiac structure is complex 
and involves impaired mitochondrial function and oxidative 
stress, which alter the transcription and translation processes 
essential for cardiac adaptation.140,141 In a rat model of diabe-
tes mellitus, prolonged intra-atrial conduction time and diffuse 
interstitial fibrosis were observed, predisposing to increased ar-
rhythmogenicity.142 In patients undergoing AF ablation, abnor-
mal glucose metabolism was associated with prolonged atrial 
activation time and reduced bipolar voltages with electroana-
tomic mapping, a finding consistent with atrial fibrosis or scar.143 
Finally, autonomic dysfunction also has been implicated.144
Obstructive Sleep Apnea
Epidemiology
OSA is highly prevalent145 and has been associated with other 
AF RFs, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary 
heart disease, MI, and HF.146 The Sleep Heart Health Study 
found a 4-fold increase in the prevalence of AF with OSA, 
and one third of participants had arrhythmia during sleep.147 
The Olmsted County Study similarly found that OSA and its 
severity strongly predicted 5-year incidence of AF (HR, 2.18; 
95% CI, 1.34–3.54). In older individuals, only the magnitude 
of nocturnal oxygen desaturation was predictive of AF.125 
Similarly, a meta-analysis of 5 of prospective studies reported 
that OSA was associated with about a 2-fold increased odds 
of postoperative AF.148 Patients with OSA have a higher recur-
rence of AF after cardioversion149 and catheter ablation (rela-
tive risk, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08–1.45).150
The impact of OSA on AF outcomes was studied in the 
ORBIT-AF registry.151 Patients with OSA had more severe symp-
toms and were at higher risk of hospitalization (HR, 1.12; 95% 
CI, 1.03–1.22) than those without OSA, but had similar mortality, 
risk of stroke, or MI. Patients with OSA who were treated with 
CPAP were less likely to progress to permanent AF subtype than 
those who were untreated (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46–0.94).
Pathophysiology
Electroanatomic mapping in patients undergoing AF ablation 
has been used to characterize the AF substrate associated with 
OSA.152 Observed structural changes included increased atrial 
size and expansive areas of low voltage or electric silence, 
which indicate fibrosis, loss of atrial myocardium, or electric 
uncoupling. Prolonged and regional disparities in atrial con-
duction also were seen. AF associated with OSA tends to be 
refractory to cardioversion and catheter ablation particularly 
in patients with untreated OSA, highlighting the expansive 
atrial remodeling associated with OSA.149 In a rat model of 
AF, OSA was associated with atrial conduction slowing attrib-
uted to connexin-43 downregulation and increased atrial fibro-
sis. Such atrial remodeling promoted the persistence of AF.153
Several mechanisms may account for the development of AF 
and the AF substrate in patients with OSA. First, surges of sym-
pathetic activity induced by hypoxia and the chemoreflex near 
the end of an apneic episode result in transient blood pressure 
rises.154 Second, vigorous inspiratory efforts during apnea ac-
centuate the fluctuation of intrathoracic pressure increasing left 
atrial volume (stretch) and pressure.155 Third, an increase in oxi-
dative stress signaling156 and systemic inflammatory mediators157 
may promote atrial remodeling. Fourth, hypercapnia acutely 
prolongs ERP and slows conduction velocity, but with return of 
eucapnia delayed recovery of conduction has been associated 
with increased AF vulnerability.158 Fifth, negative tracheal pres-
sure shortens atrial ERP and atrial monophasic action potential 
via vagal stimulation, which enhances AF inducibility.159
High Blood Pressure
Epidemiology
In the FHS, the RF-adjusted OR for AF was 1.5 and 1.4 in men 
and women with hypertension, respectively.160 Later studies, 
including the FHS, found a limited association with mean ar-
terial pressure but found that pulse pressure was highly pre-
dictive of AF risk.161 The CHARGE-AF consortium observed 
that both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were predic-
tive of AF risk.54 In addition, systolic blood pressure that 
approaches the upper limit of normal is associated with in-
creased AF risk in healthy, middle-aged men162 and women.163 
The Women’s Health Study also showed that when an indi-
vidual’s blood pressure remained elevated at follow-up visits, 
the risk of AF was higher when compared with those whose 
subsequent blood pressure recordings were lower suggesting 
a role for secondary prevention.163 The recent 50-year analysis 
of the FHS showed that although the rate of treated hyperten-
sion increased and severe hypertension became less prevalent, 
the population attributed risk of AF was unaffected suggesting 
that antihypertensive therapy does not completely eliminate 
the elevated AF risk associated with hypertension.28
Pathophysiology
Increased left atrial size is a well-established, independent 
predictor of AF,160,164 but other pathological features of chron-
ic hypertension, including left ventricular hypertrophy160,164,165 
and impaired diastolic dysfunction,166 are also associated with 
AF. Common to all is an elevated left ventricular end-diastolic 
 
pressure, which increases left atrial pressure and volume. 
Atrial remodeling is associated with slower and more hetero-
geneous atrial conduction and increased PV firing. In addition, 
increased left atrial mass supports multiple reentry circuits.
Studies of animal models of hypertension have reported that 
early left atrial remodeling is characterized by atrial dilation 
with hypertrophy, reduced atrial ejection fraction, increased 
refractoriness, and prominent inflammatory infiltrates.167 
Chronically, interstitial fibrosis and conduction slowing and 
heterogeneity are observed.167,168 Moreover, increased atrial 
apoptosis has been observed.168 Electrophysiology studies in 
patients with chronically treated hypertension, but without AF, 
have shown global conduction slowing, regionally delayed con-
duction in the crista terminalis, and increased AF inducibility.169
Animal studies have suggested that the renin–angiotensin– 
aldosterone system (RAAS), which stimulates myocyte hy-
pertrophy and intracellular fibrosis, also may contribute to 
atrial remodeling.170–172 Although upstream RAAS blockage 
was effective in animal models for reducing AF remodeling, 
2 separate meta-analyses have reported that the benefit of 
RAAS blockade was limited to patients with HF or left ven-
tricular hypertrophy.173,174

Clinical Outcomes
Stroke
Epidemiology
AF is associated with increased risk of stroke and transient 
ischemic attack175,176; furthermore, AF-related strokes increase 
the risk of long-term disability or death.3
In the FHS, the attributable risk of AF for stroke was 1.5% 
among 50 to 59 years olds, whereas among 80 to 89 years 
olds, it was 23.5%.176 Often AF is asymptomatic and conse-
quently subclinical; however, in patients with implanted cardi-
ac devices, including pacemaker and defibrillators, the burden 
of AF, including subclinical AF, may be accurately assessed. 
Atrial tachyarrhythmia (atrial rate >190 bpm) for longer than 
6 minutes has been associated with an increased risk of clini-
cal AF (HR, 5.56; 95% CI, 3.78–8.17) and ischemic stroke 
(HR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.28–4.89).177
The risk of stroke with AF is variable and is modulated by 
other RFs, including age ≥65, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
previous stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism 
history, vascular disease, HF, and female sex.178–180 Stroke risk 
models incorporating these RFs have been validated.181
Strokes in AF patients are associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality. In the Copenhagen Stroke Study, 
compared with individuals without AF, patients with AF had 
higher rates of in-hospital death (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2–2.5), 
longer hospital stay (50 verses 40 days; P<0.001), and lower 
rates of discharge home (versus care facility; OR, 0.60; 95% 
CI, 0.44–0.85).182 Moreover, the infarct was larger and more 
commonly involved the cerebral cortex in patients with AF. 
The same study also showed that the odds for silent infarcts 
were similar for patients with AF and non-AF (OR, 0.99; 
95% CI, 0.65–1.5).182 Correspondingly, the FHS showed 
increased 30-day mortality in AF-associated strokes than 
non-AF strokes (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.04–3.27). Individuals 
with AF had worse 1-year survival after stroke and increased 
risk of stroke recurrences compared with those with non-AF 
strokes.3
Pathophysiology
Thrombogenesis in AF is not fully elucidated. A confluence 
of factors, including blood stasis, endothelial dysfunction, and 
prothrombotic state, has been implicated.
Attention has focused on the left atrial appendage (LAA). 
Animal models of AF demonstrate atrial contractile dysfunc-
tion from reduced myofibrillar sensitivity to Ca2+ 183 and intra-
cellular Ca2+ transients.184 Clinically, reduced LAA emptying 
velocity on transesophageal echocardiography is associated 
with the presence of spontaneous echo contrast, increased 
LAA thrombus, and stroke.185 In vitro studies have attributed 
spontaneous echo contrast to erythrocytes and fibrinogen in-
teraction under low flow and shear stress.186 The role of LAA 
in AF-related stroke is further supported by efficacy of LAA 
closure devices for reducing strokes in patients with AF.187
Observational studies have revealed abnormalities in co-
agulation in patients with AF-related strokes. Increases in 
prothrombin fragment and thrombin–antithrombin complexes 
have been observed in patients with AF-related strokes188 and 
in those with transesophageal spontaneous echo contrast.189 
Other hemostatic factors have been implicated in contributing 
to the hypercoagulable state, including fibrinogen, d-dimer, 
factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor.188,190–193 However, in 
an adjusted model, the FHS showed that such abnormalities 
are ascribed to AF RFs and presence of cardiovascular disease 
rather than AF alone.194 Finally, inflammation may mediate 
endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulability.
Extracranial Systemic Thromboembolism
Epidemiology
Compared with AF-related stroke, relatively less is known 
about epidemiology of extracranial systemic embolism events 
(SEEs). Data from the Danish Atrial Fibrillation Cohort showed 
an association between hospital diagnosis of AF and increased 
relative risk of SEEs in men (relative risk, 4.0; 95% CI, 3.5–4.6) 
and women (relative risk, 5.7; 95% CI, 5.1–6.3). Nearly, half of 
SEEs occurred in patients between the ages of 70 and 79 years. 
The highest risk period for SEE was during the first year of 
incident AF, which is consistent with stroke data.195
More contemporary data are derived from a pooled analy-
sis of 4 AF antiplatelet and anticoagulation trials with 37 973 
patients from >40 countries.196 During the mean follow-up 
of 2.4 years, there were 221 SEEs accounting for 11.5% of 
clinically apparent embolic events. The incidence rates per 
100 person-years for SEE and stroke were 0.24 and 1.92, re-
spectively. Anatomically, SEEs were more likely to involve 
the lower extremities (58%) and mesenteric circulation (22%), 
whereas involvement of splenic and renal circulation was less 
common. Finally, increased morbidity and mortality was asso-
ciated with SEE because 64% of patients required an interven-
tional procedure or amputation and 24% died within 30 days.
Pathophysiology
The mechanisms underlying thromboembolism with SEE are 
similar to that of AF-related strokes.
Dementia
Epidemiology
Whereas dementia and AF share similar RFs, including ad-
vancing age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, AF is 
associated with an adjusted increased risk of cognitive impair-
ment,197,198 dementia,197,199–202 Alzheimer’s dementia,203 and vascu-
lar dementia202 in patients with and without a history of stroke. In 
patients with normal baseline cognitive function and no history of 
stroke, meta-analysis of 8 studies found a significantly increased 
risk of incident dementia in those with AF (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 
1.17–1.72).200 In patients with history of stroke, 2 meta-analyses 
have shown that AF is associated with ≈ 2.5-fold adjusted risk of 
cognitive impairment and dementia.197,199 Twenty-year follow-up 
of the Rotterdam Study reported AF patients <67 years of age had 
greatest risk of dementia. The dementia risk increased with AF 
duration (exposure), whereas there was no increased risk associ-
ated with AF duration in those ≥67 years of age.201
Pathophysiology
Multiple mechanisms may explain the association of AF and 
dementia. Nearly, one third of patients with AF have been ob-
served to have silent brain infarcts on brain magnetic reso-
nance imaging,204 and micro-thromboembolisms with covert 
infarction have been implicated as 1 possible mechanism. 
The FHS showed that over the past 3 decades, the incidence 
of dementia, including dementia associated with AF, has 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
 Staerk et al  Atrial Fibrillation: Epidemiology and Pathophysiology  1509
decreased.202 During this time period, there has been improved 
use of anticoagulation in individuals with AF supporting the 
hypothesis that anticoagulation may reduce AF-associated de-
mentia. This supposition is supported by a retrospective study 
of patients receiving long-term warfarin showing that incident 
dementia was 2.4× higher in individuals with AF versus those 
without AF and that the dementia risk in those with AF and 
non-AF was significantly mitigated by increasing time in ther-
apeutic range.205
A second possible mechanism may involve cerebral hy-
poperfusion associated with AF.206,207 Interestingly, 1 study 
indicated that the effect of AF on cerebral perfusion was most 
pronounced in younger patients (<50 years) and that no differ-
ence was observed in those >65 years of age206 consistent with 
epidemiological data showing age-dependent dementia risk in 
AF patients.201
Heart Failure
Epidemiology
HF is both an RF and an adverse clinical cardiovascular out-
come associated with AF. The association was first recognized 
in the 1940s,208 and it is now established that HF and AF often 
coexist,2 predispose to the other,209 and share common RFs, 
including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary disease, 
and valvular disease.
HF as a RF for AF
In major HF trials, the prevalence of AF in patients with HF 
ranges from 13% to 27%,210–212 and the prevalence increases 
with increasing New York Heart Association Functional 
Class.213 In the FHS, HF was associated with 4.5-fold risk of 
AF in men and 5.9-fold risk in woman.2 Other epidemiological 
studies showed 2.67- to 3.37-fold risk of AF associated with 
HF.214,215 Incremental reductions in systolic function are asso-
ciated with increasing AF risk.164 HF with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF) also confers an increased risk of developing 
AF (HR adjusted for age and sex, 3.75; 95% CI, 2.19–6.40) 
with grade IV diastolic dysfunction as assessed with echocar-
diography conferring the highest risk.166
HF as an Outcome Associated With AF
The FHS uniquely reported the joint incidence of AF and 
HF and their temporal relationship. Among 931 participants 
with HF, 24% had previous or concurrent AF, and 17% sub-
sequently developed AF. One fifth of participants had AF and 
HF detected on the same day,209 demonstrating the closely in-
terlinked pathophysiology. The incidence of first HF in FHS 
participants with AF is 33 per 1000 person-years,209 which is 
comparable to that observed in the Danish nationwide cohort 
study.216 In a contemporary FHS cohort, the incidence of HF 
was markedly higher in participants with AF than the inci-
dence of AF in those with antecedent HF.217 In other words, 
AF begets HF more than HF begets AF.
The association of AF on HF subtype has also been re-
ported. AF precedes HFpEF more commonly than HF with re-
duced ejection fraction. Among patients with prevalent AF, the 
adjusted HRs of incident HFpEF and HF with reduced ejec-
tion fraction were 2.34 (95% CI, 1.48–3.70) and 1.32 (95% 
CI, 0.83–2.10), respectively.217 The finding that AF is more 
predictive of HFpEF is consistent with increased incident AF 
in patients with HFpEF versus HF with reduced ejection frac-
tion and suggests shared common mechanisms.166
In the FHS, the combination of AF and HF was associ-
ated with reduced survival.209 Among patients with prevalent 
AF, incident HF was associated with increased all-cause mor-
tality compared with those without HF (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 
1.04–1.51).217 In one of the largest, worldwide studies, HF was 
found to be the leading cause of death 1 year after new onset 
of AF accounting for nearly a third of all deaths.218 A meta-
analysis showed a significantly higher all-cause mortality in 
AF patient with HF with reduced ejection fraction than those 
with HFpEF (relative risk, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12–1.36) despite 
similar risk of stroke and HF hospitalizations.219
Pathophysiology
The strong association of HF and AF has been attributed to 
shared mechanisms that lead to neurohormonal and proinflam-
matory activation, which induces myocardial inflammation and 
fibrosis. The atrial substrate with HF is characterized by atrial fi-
brosis and abnormalities in Ca2+ handling. It is distinct from the 
electrophysiological changes associated with AF-induced atrial 
remodeling.220 Studies in dogs221 and humans222 indicate that HF 
induces an AF-susceptible atrial substrate without significantly 
altering atrial ERP (except at rapid rates) or ERP heterogene-
ity. These findings differ from the AF begets AF model with 
reduced atrial ERP. Histological studies in HF dogs revealed 
structural changes, including interstitial fibrosis with cellular 
hypertrophy, degeneration, and loss. These changes were as-
sociated with regions of delayed conduction and AF suscepti-
bility. In human, extensive atrial fibrosis has been observed at 
autopsy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy,223 and areas 
of low voltage or electric silence (scar) and fractionated or de-
layed potentials (slow conduction) have been identified during 
electrophysiology studies in patients with HF (but no AF).222 
Neurohormonal activation is central to the generation of the 
AF substrate with HF, and the milieu of profibrotic mediators 
is induced through angiotensin-dependent and angiotensin- 
independent pathways.224 Meta-analyses demonstrate benefit of 
upstream RAAS inhibition in AF patients with HF, but not in 
AF patients with other comorbidities, highlighting the unique 
pathophysiology of AF with HF.174,176 Oxidized calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II has been shown to be a molecular 
signal that is increased by RAAS activation and is a common 
promoter of sinus node dysfunction, AF, and HF; thus, reduc-
ing this kinase with RAAS block may explain the benefit of 
upstream therapy in patients with both AF and HF.225,226
Increased trigger activity also is associated with HF and 
may increase risk of AF in the vulnerable substrate by gen-
erating a rapid burst of ectopic firing or maintaining a fo-
cal driver. In dogs, HF prolongs the APD and increases the 
phosphorylation of key regulatory kinases and phosphatases, 
including calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. The net ef-
fect of these HF-mediated changes is to enhance Ca2+ uptake 
into the sarcoplasmic reticulum promoting afterdepolarization 
initiation.183 Similarly, HF has been shown to increase calcium 
sparks in cardiomyocytes isolated from the PVs of rabbits.227
Finally, tachycardia and shortening of diastolic filling 
time associated with irregular ventricular activation with AF 
further impair diastolic relaxation and promote clinical HF,

which further induces atrial remodeling leading to the per-
petuation of AF.
Myocardial Infarction
Epidemiology
As with HF, there is a bidirectional relationship between AF 
and MI. Coronary heart disease is associated with an increased 
risk of AF,228 but AF also is associated with increased risk of 
MI.229 In the REGARDS cohort, AF was associated with a 
2-fold increased risk of MI,230 that was greater in women (HR, 
2.16; 95% CI, 1.41–3.31) versus men (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 
0.91–2.10) and blacks (HR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.67–3.86) versus 
whites (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.83–1.93). The Olmsted study re-
ported similar unadjusted risk of coronary ischemic event, but 
after adjusting for age, the incidence was higher in men than 
woman.231 Among those with newly diagnosed AF, the risk of 
death after coronary ischemic events was higher in woman 
than men (HR, 2.99; 95% CI, 2.53–3.53 versus HR, 2.33; 95% 
CI, 1.94–2.81). Interestingly, as observed with strokes and 
SEEs, the event rate of coronary ischemic events was highest 
within the first year of incident AF (4.7%, 95% CI, 3.9–5.6) 
and subsequently declined to 2.5% per year.
Pathophysiology
The mechanisms linking AF to MI are not completely un-
derstood. First, both AF and MI have overlapping RFs that 
may lead to the development of AF and MI in parallel. For 
instance, both AF and coronary heart disease are associated 
with proinflammatory and prothrombotic states. Second, MI 
in AF may be attributed to coronary artery thromboembolism. 
Third, myocardial ischemia may arise from supply–demand 
mismatch in the setting of tachycardia associated with AF. 
Fourth, MI may lead to left ventricular remodeling that may 
predispose to AF.
Venous Thromboembolism
Epidemiology
Increased BMI, obesity, and smoking are associated with ve-
nous thromboembolism (VTE)232–235 and AF. Potential direct 
causal relationship between AF and VTE has been proposed, 
but needs to be studied further.236,237
A few studies have reported increased risk of VTE in AF 
and vice versa. In a retrospective cohort study based on the 
national administrative database in Taiwan, the risks of VTE 
(adjusted HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.36–2.24) and pulmonary em-
bolism (adjusted HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.51–3.15) were both 
higher in the AF group compared with non-AF referents.238 
A Norwegian administrative database study reported that AF 
was associated with an increased risk of pulmonary embolism 
(adjusted HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.16–2.90) but not VTE (adjusted 
HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.64–1.68).236 In addition, the same study 
found that individuals with incident VTE were subsequently 
at a higher risk of developing incident AF (adjusted HR, 1.63; 
95% CI, 1.22–2.17) compared with those without VTE.237 It 
should be noted that in both the Taiwanese and Norwegian 
cohorts, a significant proportion of individuals had preexisting 
RFs for VTE, including lower extremity fracture, recent sur-
gery, cancer, and immobility.236,238 In comparison to individu-
als with AF or VTE alone, those with AF and VTE were older 
and had higher mean BMI. In the Norwegian study, the mean 
age and BMI were 64 years and 26.9 kg/m2 for AF alone, 57 
years and 26.7 kg/m2 for VTE alone, and 68 years and 29.2 kg/
m2 for AF and VTE combined.237
Pathophysiology
The mechanisms underlying the AF-VTE association are in-
explicable. Several studies have shown that AF is associated 
with a hypercoagulable state attributed to elevated hemostatic 
factors, including fibrinogen, d-dimer, prothrombin fragment, 
factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor188,190–193; however, many 
of these studies were not adjusted for coexisting cardiovascu-
lar RF. In an adjusted model, the FHS showed no significant 
difference in levels of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, or 
tissue-type plasminogen activator, suggesting that coexisting 
RFs rather than AF may explain elevated thrombotic risk.
Mortality
Epidemiology
The FHS was one of the first studies to report that AF had 
a multivariable-adjusted association with increased risk of 
death.4 In addition, the study observed a significant interac-
tion, such that AF diminished the survival advantage gener-
ally enjoyed by women; the multivariable-adjusted OR for 
death in men and women was 1.5 and 1.9, respectively. At 
10-year follow-up, 61.5% of men with AF between 55 and 
74 years of age had died compared with 30.0% of men in 
the same age group without AF. A similar trend was found 
in women with 57.6% of those with AF dying by 10-year fol-
low-up when compared with 20.9% in those without AF. The 
increased risk was consistent across all decades of age from 
55 to 95 years. Even in individuals without clinical evidence 
of cardiovascular or valvular disease at baseline, AF was as-
sociated with a 2-fold increased risk of death.4 A retrospective 
study of Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older showed that 
death was the most frequent AF outcome with an incidence of 
19.5% at 1 year and 48.8% at 5 years after initial diagnosis.239 
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 64 studies 
that included 1 009 501 patients with 149 746 (14.8%) having 
AF found a pooled relative risk of death that was 1.6 (95% CI, 
1.39–1.53), although there was marked heterogeneity.240 In 14 
studies, cardiovascular mortality was assessed, and the pooled 
relative risk associated with AF was 2.03 (95% CI, 1.79–2.3).
It is noteworthy that there is growing evidence that AF 
is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. 
Pooled analysis of the ARIC and Cardiovascular Health Study 
cohorts showed that AF was associated with more than a 
doubling of the risk of sudden cardiac death compared with 
participants without AF (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.95–3.13).241 A 
meta-analysis of 7 studies found the relative risk of sudden 
cardiac death was 1.88 (95% CI, 1.36–2.6), although signifi-
cant study heterogeneity was present.241 In the RE-LY trial, 
37.4% of all deaths and 60.4% of cardiac deaths were attrib-
uted to either sudden cardiac death or death because of pro-
gressive HF.242 For comparison, only 9.8% of all deaths were 
attributed to stroke or hemorrhage.
A meta-analysis of antithrombotic studies has shown 
that oral anticoagulation reduced risk of all-cause mortal-
ity with an absolute risk reduction of 1.6% when compared 
with control or placebo.243 In anticoagulated patients with 
AF, increased mortality is largely driven by cardiovascular

causes rather than nonhemorrhagic stroke or systemic embo-
lism.242,244–246 Strokes comprised a small portion of deaths from 
AF. In the ROCKET AF trial, cardiovascular deaths occurred 
over 2× more often than strokes.244 Predictors of higher all-
cause mortality included HF (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.33–1.70) 
and age ≥75 (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.51–1.90). Thus, further 
advances in anticoagulation strategies may have little effect on 
improving overall mortality in AF.
Conclusions
Over the past 50 years, the FHS and other epidemiological 
studies have yielded a breadth of data associating various RFs 
with risk of AF and providing insight into their mechanistic 
link to AF genesis. However, many questions remain. Will ge-
netic studies improve AF risk assessment, identify novel ther-
apeutic targets, and help guide treatment strategies for both 
primary and secondary prevention of AF? By what degree 
does RF modification alter the atrial substrate, AF burden, and 
clinical outcomes? What are the target goals for RF modifica-
tion and how will genetics alter these targets? Ongoing and 
future epidemiological, translational, and clinical studies may 
provide insight into these unanswered questions and improve 
clinical outcomes in patients with AF.
