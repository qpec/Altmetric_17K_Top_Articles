A highly effective vaccine would be a valuable weapon in the
drive toward malaria elimination. No such vaccine currently exists,
and only a handful of the hundreds of potential candidates in the
parasite genome have been evaluated. In this study, we system-
atically evaluated 29 antigens likely to be involved in erythrocyte
invasion, an essential developmental stage during which the
malaria parasite is vulnerable to antibody-mediated inhibition.
Testing antigens alone and in combination identified several
strain-transcending targets that had synergistic combinatorial
effects in vitro, while studies in an endemic population revealed
that combinations of the same antigens were associated with
protection from febrile malaria. Video microscopy established that
the most effective combinations targeted multiple discrete stages
of invasion, suggesting a mechanistic explanation for synergy.
Overall, this study both identifies specific antigen combinations
for high-priority clinical testing and establishes a generalizable
approach that is more likely to produce effective vaccines.

M
alaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasites remains
one of the most significant global public health challenges,
with more than 200 million cases and 438,000 deaths in 2015 (1).
There has recently been significant progress in reducing malaria
mortality (2), but the emergence and spread of parasites resistant
to current frontline antimalarial artemisinin (3) threaten current
control methods and emphasize the need for novel control and
intervention tools, such as an effective vaccine. Malaria vaccine
development has been challenging, with only one vaccine, RTS,S
(Mosquirix), reaching phase III trials, where it had limited, albeit
consistent, efficacy (4). While the WHO has recommended that
RTS,S be advanced to large-scale pilots in Africa, the well-
established
partial
efficacy
coupled
with
concerns
about
strain-specific responses (5) makes identifying additional com-
ponents to include in a second-generation P. falciparum vaccine
an urgent priority.
Two significant challenges confront P. falciparum antigen
identification—the complexity of the parasite life cycle, which
presents a large number of potential targets, and the depth of
genomic diversity across global parasite populations (6), which
makes the development of strain-transcending protection diffi-
cult. Given these twin challenges, an effective second-generation
vaccine will almost certainly need to target multiple components
simultaneously (7). Despite this fact, malaria vaccine develop-
ment has so far primarily focused on a very limited number of
targets, leaving the vast majority of potential candidates encoded
by the >5,000-gene P. falciparum genome unexplored (8). The
search for vaccines targeting erythrocyte invasion is a microcosm
of this broader challenge. Erythrocyte invasion, the process by
which P. falciparum merozoites recognize, form protein–protein
interactions with, and then actively invade human erythrocytes, is
essential for parasite survival and is the only window during blood
stage development when the parasite is extracellular and therefore
exposed to antibody-mediated inhibition. It is also a very complex
process, potentially involving more than 400 genes, including more
than 100 that may encode for surface-exposed proteins (9). Until
now, however, invasion-blocking vaccines have focused on only a
handful of targets, which not coincidentally were also among the
first P. falciparum genes ever sequenced (8).
A reverse vaccinology approach will be needed to identify new
targets from this long candidate list, incorporating systematic
screens of a larger number of antigens and using data from multiple
sources to identify potentially synergistic combinations. We have
previously used a mammalian expression system to express a library
of entire ectodomains, up to 200 kDa in length, from merozoite-
expressed Plasmodium proteins that are thought to be involved
in erythrocyte recognition and entry (10). Expressing full-length
Significance
Malaria still kills hundreds of thousands of children each year.
Malaria vaccine development is complicated by high levels of
parasite genetic diversity, which makes single target vaccines
vulnerable to the development of variant-specific immunity. To
overcome this hurdle, we systematically screened a panel of
29 blood-stage antigens from the most deadly human malaria
parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. We identified several targets
that were able to inhibit erythrocyte invasion in two geneti-
cally diverse strains. Testing these targets in combination
identified several pairs that blocked invasion more effectively
in combination than in isolation. Video microscopy and studies
of natural immune responses to malaria in patients suggest
that targeting multiple steps in invasion is more likely to pro-
duce a synergistic vaccine response.

MICROBIOLOGY
 protein ectodomains in the context of a eukaryotic secretory
pathway allows disulphide bonds to form and maximizes the chance
that the recombinant antigens will fold correctly to mimic the
function and antigenicity of native P. falciparum proteins, all of
which pass through the P. falciparum secretory pathway. This li-
brary has been used to identify new protein–protein interactions
(11), perform detailed biochemical analysis of known interactions
(12), and underpin large-scale immunoepidemiological studies to
identify targets of protective immunity (13). In this study, we tested
whether this ectodomain library could be used to identify new
erythrocyte invasion-blocking vaccine combinations by raising an-
tibodies against multiple P. falciparum proteins, systematically
testing their ability to inhibit invasion, and incorporating immu-
noepidemiological and mechanistic data to identify synergistic
combinations.
Results
Systematic Screening Identifies Strain-Transcendent Vaccine Candidates.
The extracellular domain of each target protein, based on the se-
quence from the ref. 3D7 P. falciparum genome, was produced in a
soluble recombinant form by transient transfection of HEK239E
cells (14). We down-selected 29 targets for further investigation,
based both on the diversity of their known or inferred subcellular
location and on pragmatic considerations such as protein expression
level (Fig. S1 and Table S1). We purified 0.4–1.0 mg of each protein
using nickel affinity chromatography and used them to raise poly-
clonal rabbit antibodies. Total IgG antibodies were purified using
protein G columns and tested by ELISA to confirm binding activity
against the immunizing antigens (Fig. S2) before being used in
growth inhibition activity (GIA) assays.
To establish whether each antibody alone could inhibit parasite
growth, late trophozoite stage P. falciparum parasites were cultured
in the presence of IgG at the maximum concentration that could be
purified from the polyclonal antisera. Parasites were incubated with
each IgG for 24 h to allow sufficient time for erythrocyte invasion
to occur, before parasitemia was measured using flow cytometry
(15). Antigen polymorphism has been a major cause of failure for
previous P. falciparum candidate antigens. To incorporate testing
for strain-transcending inhibition at the earliest stage of candidate
down-selection, antibodies against all 29 targets were tested against
both 3D7 and Dd2 parasites, which have genome sequences
broadly representative of West African and Asian P. falciparum
parasites, respectively, and differ at >15,000 nucleotide positions
across the 23-Mb genome (16). IgG purified from polyclonal an-
tibodies raised against PfRh5, a leading strain-transcending blood-
stage vaccine candidate (17, 18), was used as a comparator in this
and subsequent experiments. Antibodies raised against the 3D7
variants of PfMSP1, PfSERA9, PfMSRP5, PfEBA181, PfCyRPA,
and PfRAMA all had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of
both 3D7 and Dd2 parasites, inhibiting 3D7 growth to a similar
extent as anti-PfRh5 antibodies (Fig. 1). PfEBA181, PfMSRP5,
and PfSERA9 are members of gene families in which at least one
other gene is known or suspected to play a role in erythrocyte in-
vasion [PfMSP7-like (19), EBL (20), PfSERA (21)], so the in-
hibitory effects of each of these antibodies could in part be
explained by cross-reactivity against multiple members of each
protein family. We therefore tested the ability of the purified IgG
for each of these proteins to recognize other members of each
family, but only in the case of PfMSRP5-specific IgG was there any
evidence for cross-reactivity (Fig. S3), suggesting the IgG responses
are largely target-specific. PfCyRPA is a member of a protein
complex that includes PfRh5 (22, 23), while little is known about
the function of PfRAMA, although antibodies against it have
previously been associated with protection against malaria (24).
PfMSP1 is an extensively studied vaccine target with known allele-
specific effects (25) and so was excluded from further study.
To quantitatively compare the inhibitory potential of IgG spe-
cific for the remaining five targets, GIA assays were performed
using increasing concentrations of purified IgG to generate IC50
values. All exhibited a clear dose-dependent inhibitory effect on
the growth of both 3D7 and Dd2 parasites (Fig. S4), with IC50
values ranging from 0.25 mg/mL to 1.5 mg/mL total IgG (Table
S2). Antibodies raised against PfSERA9, PfMSRP5, and PfRh5
did not show any evidence of strain specificity, with almost no
difference in IC50 values between the two strains. Antibodies
against PfEBA181, PfCyRPA, and PfRAMA all showed some
reduction in efficacy against Dd2 relative to 3D7 parasites, with an
accompanying 1.7-fold (PfCyRPA and PfRAMA) and 2.7-fold
(PfEBA181) increase in IC50 values. However, the difference in
IC50 values for PfCyRPA and PfRAMA against 3D7 and Dd2
parasites was relatively minor and of a similar magnitude to shifts
in IC50 values between different strains for anti-PfRh5 antibodies
(18), and moreover, PfCyRPA has previously been reported to
have broadly strain-transcendent effects (22, 26). Strain specificity
is therefore only an immediate concern in the case of PfEBA181.
Candidates Identified in Vitro Are Associated with Protection from
Clinical Malaria in Vivo. Repeated exposure to P. falciparum malaria
generates immune responses to a large number of antigens (13,
27), which can result in clinical immunity. To investigate whether
antibodies to these vaccine targets contribute to clinical immunity,
we tested for the presence of naturally acquired IgG in uninfected
Malian individuals enrolled in a prospective cohort study in which
we previously described an association between PfRh5-specific
IgG and protection from febrile malaria (28). At the uninfected
baseline before the 6-mo malaria season, antigen-specific IgG
levels and seroprevalence increased with age for all antigens ex-
cept for PfCyRPA, which demonstrated poor natural immunoge-
nicity, similar to its binding partner PfRh5 (Fig. 2 A and B). We
next evaluated whether these baseline IgG levels predicted pro-
tection from febrile malaria during the ensuing malaria season.
Associations between risk of febrile malaria, as measured by time-
to-first febrile malaria episode after incident blood-stage infection,
and IgG levels for each antigen, alone and in combination, were
examined using a Cox regression model that included age, sickle
cell trait, gender, and anemia as covariates. Although IgG specific
for PfCyRPA, PfEBA181, PfMSRP5, PfRAMA, or PfSERA9 did
not predict protection individually, the combined presence of IgG
specific for PfEBA181, PfMSRP5, or PfRAMA with PfRh5-
specific IgG was associated with reduced malaria risk relative to
Fig. 1.

 PfRh5-specific IgG alone, albeit with overlapping confidence in-
tervals (CIs) (Table S3). A significantly reduced hazard ratio for
the anti-PfEBA181 IgG + anti-PfRH5 IgG combination relative to
anti-PfEBA181 IgG alone suggests that antibodies generated
against these two antigens may provide malaria-protective synergy
(Table S3). Notably, two combinations that did not contain anti-
PfRh5 IgG (anti-PfEBA181 IgG + anti-PfMSRP5 IgG + anti-
PfRAMA IgG and anti-PfMSRP5 IgG + anti-PfRAMA IgG)
also predicted protection from malaria (Table S3). The protective
effect of anti-PfEBA181 IgG + anti-PfMSRP5 IgG + anti-
PfRAMA IgG, but not PfMSRP5 IgG + anti-PfRAMA IgG,
remained significant even after controlling for reactivity against
other P. falciparum antigens, including PfRh5 (Fig. 2C). To de-
termine whether positive IgG responses affected parasite growth,
we compared in vivo parasite multiplication rates (PMRs) be-
tween negative and positive responders for each antigen combi-
nation among individuals for whom parasite density data were
available. Although IgG responses to PfMSRP5 + PfRh5 and
PfRAMA associated with lower PMRs in univariate analyses,
these associations were not significant after adjusting for multiple
testing or in logistic regression models that included age, sickle cell
trait, anemia, and gender as covariates (Table S4).
Combining Targets at Multiple Steps of Invasion Can Increase Synergy.
These data suggest that IgG responses to these antigens contribute
to naturally acquired immunity to malaria and also suggest that
combining these antigens in a vaccine could improve protective
efficacy. We therefore assessed whether combining purified total
IgG from different targets could act synergistically to inhibit par-
asite growth in vitro. The amount of anti-PfRAMA IgG was
limiting, so we were only able to test this antibody in combination
with anti-PfRh5 and anti-PfCyRPA IgG. Antibody interactions
were evaluated over a range of concentrations by a fixed-ratio
method (29), and IC50 values were used to calculate the 50%
fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC50). FIC50 values at dif-
ferent concentration ratios were used to construct isobolograms
for each antibody combination (Fig. 3). Several combinations of
antibodies showed deviations from the diagonal line that would in-
dicate a purely additive interaction under Loewe additivity. Com-
binations of anti-PfCyRPA/PfSERA9, anti-PfCyRPA/PfRAMA,
anti-PfRh5/PfRAMA, and anti-PfRh5/PfMSRP5 all showed devia-
tions below the diagonal, indicating a trend toward synergy (Fig. 3 C
and F–H), whereas the combinations of anti-PfEBA181/PfCyRPA
and anti-PfEBA181/PfSERA9 showed curves above the diagonal,
indicating a trend toward antagonism (Fig. 3 A and E). Several
combinations of antibodies with anti-PfRh5 had different effects at
high and low concentrations of anti-PfRh5 (FIC50 > 1) (Fig. 3 D, I,
and J), emphasizing that the ratio in which two antibodies are
combined can determine whether a given combination has a greater
effect than that achieved by each antibody alone. To test the sta-
tistical significance of these interactions, we calculated an interaction
index for each combination and modeled its associated 95% CI
using Monte Carlo simulation of the measurement errors in the IC50
values (Fig. S5). This analysis showed no combination had CIs that
did not include one at all concentrations tested, meaning that none
were unfailingly either synergistic or antagonistic. However, the

 combinations of anti-PfRh5/PfRAMA and anti-PfCyRPA/PfRAMA
were those with the most consistently synergistic interactions, while
as noted above, several combinations including anti-PfRh5 combi-
nations were significantly synergistic at low concentrations of anti-
PfRh5 but not high concentrations (Fig. S5). Combinations that
included PfMSRP5 had particularly wide CIs, decreasing the sta-
tistical weight that can be put to them.
One potential explanation for the combinatorial effects ob-
served is that simultaneously blocking targets that act at different
steps during invasion may not have the same effect as blocking
targets that act at the same step of invasion. While the specific
function of PfRh5 during invasion has been studied in detail (30),
the role of the other antigens is much less well-defined. We
therefore carried out video microscopy studies, incubating purified
late schizonts from the 3D7 P. falciparum strain with purified IgG
at the maximal concentration for each target. Schizont egress and
subsequent merozoite–erythrocyte interactions were recorded us-
ing a recently described imaging platform (31), and multiple in-
vasion associated parameters were quantified from these videos.
All antibodies decreased the number of merozoite–erythrocyte
contacts made after each egress, but anti-PfMSRP5 had the most
significant effect at this very early stage of invasion (Fig. 4A and
Movies S1 and S2), consistent with its presence on the merozoite
surface. Anti-PfEBA181 was the only IgG that had a marked ef-
fect on prolonging the duration of merozoite–erythrocyte inter-
actions (Fig. 4B and Movie S3), suggesting that it acts after the
initial contact has occurred but before active invasion has begun,
as has been suggested for other members of the same family of
invasion ligands (30). By contrast, anti-PfRh5, PfCyRPA, and
PfSERA9 had no effect on the duration of contacts but did have a
significant effect on the severity of erythrocyte deformations (Fig.
4C and Movies S4–S6), with the majority of merozoites inducing
little to no deformation (Fig. 4D). Action at this late stage of in-
vasion, interpreted as representing tight junction formation, has
been previously reported for PfRh5 (30). Finally, anti-PfRAMA
IgG had no effect on the number or severity of deformation events
(Fig. 4 D and E and Movie S7), indicating that it inhibits invasion
much later in the process after the tight junction has been estab-
lished. Taking the data together, these targets seem to function at
discrete temporal steps during invasion, as summarized in Fig. 4:
(i) PfMSRP5, (ii) PfEBA181, (iii) PfRh5/PfCyRPA/PfSERA9,
and (iv) PfRAMA. It is notable that combinations of antibodies

 PfRAMA) were the most consistently synergistic in GIA assays.
Similarly, the combinations of antigen-specific IgG responses that
were associated with protection from febrile malaria in immu-
noepidemiological studies (Fig. 2) all targeted antigens operating
at multiple distinct steps of invasion, rather than multiple antigens
operating at the same step. Focusing combinatorial strategies on
nonoverlapping steps during invasion may therefore maximize the
chance of synergistic effects.
Discussion
Malaria vaccine candidate identification has so far largely con-
sisted of detailed preclinical studies targeting a single antigen at a
time, with two significant detrimental consequences. Firstly, few
antigens can be studied, leaving the majority of potential targets in
the P. falciparum genome unexplored. Secondly, such single tar-
gets are particularly susceptible to failure due to allele-specific
responses, as if variants in that antigen evolve that are not rec-
ognized by the dominant vaccine-induced response and there is
nothing to prevent vaccine escape. Next-generation malaria vac-
cines will need to target multiple antigens, preferably in combi-
nations that induce synergistic responses. Such a design would
mimic what is now becoming clear about natural immunity to
malaria, where the breadth of response to multiple antigens is a
much stronger predictor of protection than the response to any
single antigen (13). This study performed a systematic screen of 29
P. falciparum antigens alone and together and complemented
in vitro inhibition and mechanistic studies with an investigation of
immune responses in the field to prioritize candidates and com-
binations. Multiple targets were identified that induced antibodies
that inhibited P. falciparum growth, and several combinations of
these antibodies were synergistic in vitro, mirroring immunoepi-
demiological data that combinations of antibodies against the
same targets were associated with protection in vivo at a field site
in Mali. This study also highlights the complexity of antibody in-
teractions. For example, in in vitro invasion studies, anti-PfRh5
and anti-PfEBA181 IgG interact antagonistically at high levels of
anti-Rh5 IgG but synergistically at low levels of anti-Rh5 IgG.
Intriguingly, the latter scenario is consistent with seroepidemio-
logical data that have shown that anti-RH5 IgG associates with
malaria protection despite having relatively low reactivity (28).
Although screening 29 antigens in this manner is a significant
step forward, it represents perhaps only one-third of the antigens
that are exposed on the parasite surface during erythrocyte in-
vasion. The number of antigens that could be screened was in
part limited by the HEK293E expression system. This system has
several advantages, most significantly that by being eukaryotic it
is more likely to produce antigens that are functional and will
therefore best mimic their native counterparts. However, sig-
nificant amounts of antigen (up to 1 mg) are required for im-
munization studies such as these, and in general only 70–80% of
antigens can be expressed at these levels in the HEK293E system
(10, 32). The HEK293E expression system may also not suit all
antigens, so there is a risk of false negatives, as there is in any
systematic screen. This may explain the absence of inhibitory
antibodies generated against MSP2, for example, which has
previously been extensively investigated as a blood-stage vaccine
candidate (33). Alternative eukaryotic expression systems such as
the insect cell system used recently for successful expression of
PfRh5 (34), or the wheat germ cell-free system used for its
binding partner PfRIPR (35), may be required in addition to
perform truly comprehensive blood-stage antigen screens. Test-
ing for effective strain transcendence is also a critical consider-
ation. Now that the true extent of global genomic variation has
been revealed by large-scale genome sequencing studies (6), it is
apparent that there are several geographic regions that have
distinct genomic repertoires but for which there are no com-
monly available in vitro adapted isolates for testing. Identifica-
tion, expansion, and distribution of P. falciparum isolates from
these areas, specifically East Africa, India/Bangladesh, and
Papua New Guinea, will be an essential step to enable more
comprehensive assessment of strain transcendence. In addition,
efforts to standardize growth inhibition assays need to focus on
miniaturization, to allow testing of a larger number of isolates
when antibody volume is limiting, as it was here.
Despite these limitations, several antigens and combinations
were identified in this study. As well as identifying targets, this
work also suggests a logical rationale to guide the selection of
potentially synergistic combinations—targeting multiple in-
dependent steps in the same pathway, in this case erythrocyte
invasion. The mechanism by which a given combination results in
synergy is not known, but it has been previously suggested that
kinetics could play a role, where binding to some merozoite surface
antigens might slow invasion down sufficiently to allow other anti-
bodies to bind (36). This model certainly fits with some mechanisms
uncovered by video microscopy, such as anti-EBA181, which appears
to increase the duration of merozoite–erythrocyte contacts and shows
some evidence for synergy with anti-Rh5. However, further work is
clearly required to truly understand the mechanisms of inhibition,
and the strategy of targeting multiple steps is not the only viable
approach, as recent studies of the AMA1–RON2 interaction that
forms a complex late during erythrocyte invasion show that in this
case inhibiting both members of the same complex is more effective
than targeting either alone (37).
Targeting multiple antigens will require parasites to simulta-
neously evolve variants in multiple antigens to avoid vaccine-
induced immune responses, which should slow the emergence of
resistance at the population level. Targeting antigens that operate at
distinct steps in the same pathway offers an additional level of re-
dundancy at the single parasite level by requiring individual mero-
zoites to avoid inhibition of multiple temporally distinct steps. This
same theoretical approach may be applied to other malaria vaccine
targets, such as the recognition and invasion of hepatocytes by
Plasmodium sporozoites for pre-erythrocytic stage vaccines or gamete
development within the Anopheles midgut for transmission-blocking
vaccines. A deeper understanding of all of these biological processes
coupled with more systematic reverse vaccinology approaches will
help further drive the development of the next generation of more
complex, and more effective, malaria vaccine combinations.
Methods
Recombinant Merozoite Protein Production. Recombinant extracellular domains
of merozoite proteins were produced by transient transfection of HEK293 cells,
as previously described (11). Culture supernatants were collected after 6 d and
tested for expression of recombinant proteins by ELISA, using a mouse mono-
clonal antibody that binds the CD4 tag (OX68) to detect expressed protein.
Protein Purification and Quality Assessment. Recombinant merozoite proteins
were purified from pooled transfection supernatants using HisTrap HP col-
umns (GE Healthcare). Proteins were eluted using an elution buffer con-
taining 400 mM imidazole and then dialyzed against PBS (D-tube Dialyzer;
Novagen). The concentration of protein samples was determined by absor-
bance at 280 nm, using in silico predicted extinction coefficients (DS Gene
version 1.5; Accelrys), and quality assessed by ELISA and reducing SDS/PAGE.
Antibody Purification and Quality Assessment. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies
were raised against purified recombinant proteins by Cambridge Research
Biochemicals after ethical assessment. Sera was tested for activity against the
appropriate antigen by ELISA and then purified using a HiTrap Protein G HP
column (GE Healthcare). Purified antibodies were dialyzed against PBS (or
RPMI 1640 for invasion assays), tested for activity against the appropriate
antigen by ELISA, and quality assessed by reducing SDS/PAGE.
Parasite Culture and GIA Assays. P. falciparum 3D7 and Dd2 parasites were
cultured in human O+ erythrocytes. GIAs were carried out in round-bottom
96-well plates, with a culture volume of 100 μL per well at a hematocrit of
2%. Synchronized parasites were incubated with antibodies for 24 h at 37 °C
before being stained with 1:5,000 SYBR Green I (Invitrogen) to detect par-
asite DNA (12). Invasion efficiency was calculated by comparing invasion in

 the presence of a given antibody concentration to invasion in the absence of
antibodies. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Use of erythrocytes
from human donors for P. falciparum culture was approved by the NHS
Cambridgeshire 4 Research Ethics Committee, and all donors supplied writ-
ten informed consent.
Human Cohort Study. The details of the Malian prospective cohort study have
been described (28). The Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy
and Dentistry at the University of Sciences, Technique and Technology of
Bamako, and the Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health approved the Malian co-
hort study, which is registered on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ (no. NCT01322581).
Written, informed consent was obtained from adult participants and from the
parents or guardians of participating children. For this study, malaria episodes
were defined as an asexual parasite density by peripheral blood smear
of >2,500 parasites per μL, an axillary temperature of ≥37.5 °C within 24 h, and
no other cause of fever discernible by physical examination.
Immunoepidemiology. Plasma IgG levels against target antigens were de-
termined by ELISA as previously described (26) and outlined in detail in SI
Methods. In brief, plasma samples from each individual were tested in dupli-
cate, alongside the same positive controls (hyperimmune plasma) and nega-
tive controls (unexposed donor plasma). ODs, adjusted for background, were
converted to arbitrary units (AUs) by dividing the test OD by the mean OD for
negative controls plus 3 SDs, and AU > 1 was defined as a positive IgG re-
sponse. A base Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine
whether positive IgG responses to any of the 63 possible reactivity combina-
tions was associated with a reduction in risk of clinical malaria, using time from
first P. falciparum blood-stage inoculum (estimated as the midpoint between
the last Plasmodium-PCR–negative visit and the first Plasmodium-PCR–positive
visit) to first febrile malaria episode as the dependent variable and controlling
for potential confounding variables (Table S3). In vivo PMRs were estimated
using qPCR-determined parasite density at the first PCR-positive visit and the
number of days between the first P. falciparum blood-stage inoculum and the
first smear-positive visit. Analyses were performed in R version 3.3.0 (www.
R-project.org) or Prism version 5.0d (GraphPad Software).
Isobologram Analyses. Dose–response assays were first carried out to obtain
the IC50 of the individual antibodies. Interactions were then assessed over a
range of concentrations by a fixed-ratio method based on the IC50 values
(29). FIC50s were calculated on the basis of the IC50s obtained per assay for
each antibody (the FIC50 is equal to the IC50 of antibody A in combination
with antibody B/IC50 of antibody A alone) and used to plot isobolograms. An
interaction index was calculated by summing the FIC50 derived from each of
the two antibodies in any combination and CIs calculated using Monte Carlo
simulation based on the error terms in the fitted IC50 curves.
Video Microscopy. Highly synchronous P. falciparum 3D7 late-stage schizonts
were purified using a magnetic column (Miltenyi Biotec) and placed in a Secure-
Seal hybridization chamber (Sigma-Aldrich) mounted on a glass slide. All live-cell
experiments were performed in a homebuilt environmental chamber at 37 °C
with a humidified gas supply. Imaging was performed using a Nikon Eclipse TI-E
inverted microscope through a Plan Apo λ 40× 0.95 N.A. dry objective (Nikon).
Time-lapse videos were recorded on a Grasshopper3 GS3-U3-23S6M-C camera
(Point Gray Research) at four frames per second. A custom MATLAB program
was employed to perform image recording and statistical analysis.
