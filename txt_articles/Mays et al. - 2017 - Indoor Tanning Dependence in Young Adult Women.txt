Abstract
Background: There is mounting evidence that young people
can develop a dependence on indoor tanning, but research on
factors associated with indoor tanning dependence remains
limited.
Methods: This cross-sectional study investigated factors
associated with indoor tanning dependence in a community
sample of 389 non-Hispanic white young adult women ages
18 to 30 who had indoor tanned �1 time in the past year.
Participants completed measures of indoor tanning depen-
dence, including the modified CAGE and modified Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-IV psychiatric
screening assessments, indoor tanning behavior and beliefs,
and behavioral and psychiatric comorbidity.
Results: Overall, 22.6% of the sample screened positive for
indoor tanning dependence. In multivariable analyses, indoor
tanning dependence was associated with younger age of indoor
tanning initiation [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) ¼ 0.79; P ¼ 0.017],
indoor tanning �20 times in the past year (aOR ¼ 3.03;
P ¼ 0.015), stronger beliefs about the benefits of tanning
(aOR ¼ 2.15; P ¼ 0.004), greater perceived susceptibility to
indoor tanning risks (aOR ¼ 2.72; P < 0.001), stronger beliefs
about physical appearance (aOR ¼ 1.73; P ¼ 0.037), and depres-
sive symptoms (aOR ¼ 3.79; P < 0.001).
Conclusions: Indoor tanning dependence among young,
non-Hispanic white women is associated with behaviors that
increase the risk of skin cancer, beliefs favoring the perceived
benefits of tanning, and comorbid risks such as stronger beliefs
about physical appearance and depressed mood.
Impact: Comprehensive

Introduction
Indoor tanning is an established risk factor for melanoma
and nonmelanoma skin cancer, accounting for approximately
10% of cases in the United States annually (1) at substantial
economic cost (2). As little as a single indoor tanning exposure
increases the risks of melanoma by approximately 20% and
nonmelanoma skin cancer by 29% to 67%; these risks increase
with more frequent exposure (3, 4). Among U.S. adults, indoor
tanning is most prevalent among non-Hispanic white women
ages 18–30 years, where an estimated 15% indoor tan each year
(5, 6). Indoor tanning early in life further increases the risk of
skin cancer and is associated with early-onset disease (7, 8).
Although many young people indoor tan seasonally or
episodically for discrete events (9), there is evidence some may
develop a dependence on indoor tanning (i.e., tanning in a
compulsive, addictive manner). One hypothesis is that synthe-
sis of b-endorphin as a byproduct of ultraviolet (UV) radiation
exposure may produce opioid-like drug response (10). Evi-
dence from preclinical (10) and clinical studies (11–16) sup-
ports this model of indoor tanning addiction.
Indoor tanning dependence symptoms have typically been
measured using screening instruments adapted from other
types of substance abuse (e.g., alcohol), such as tanning despite
knowing risks, increased tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms
(17). Use of other abusable substances and psychiatric comor-
bidities are more prevalent among those screening positive for
tanning dependence in some studies. However, most have
focused on convenience samples of college students (9, 14,
15, 17–22), excluding young adults who may indoor tan but are
not enrolled in a college/university. Other research has exam-
ined tanning dependence in skin cancer patients through ret-
rospective reports subject to recall biases (23). Theories such
as Health Belief Model and Theory of Reasoned Action also
indicate behavioral beliefs, including perceived risks (severity,
susceptibility) associated with a behavior, perceived benefits
of a behavior, and positive behavioral attitudes, are factors
influencing risk behavior engagement and are important inter-
vention targets (24–26). Some studies have assessed associa-
tions between behavioral beliefs and indoor tanning behavior
(27–30), but there is little research on how such beliefs relate to
indoor tanning dependence when examined alongside potential
psychiatric comorbidities. This evidence is critical to develop
interventions for skin cancer prevention.
The objective of this study was to examine factors associated
with indoor tanning dependence in a community sample of non-
Hispanic white women ages 18 to 30 years who indoor tan,

Materials and Methods
Sample and setting
Details of study recruitment and procedures were reported
previously (31). Eligibility criteria included: young adult women
18 to 30 years of age; non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity; and
indoor tanning at least once in the past 12 months. Given the
relatively limited research on indoor tanning dependence and its
correlates, the study focused on this group because it has the
highest prevalence of indoor tanning in the U.S. adult population
(6). Participants were recruited from September 2013 to Decem-
ber 2016 from the Washington, DC, metropolitan area through
Internet classifieds, advertisements in local periodicals, and com-
munity flyers. Eligibility criteria were assessed by telephone
among those who contacted study personnel in response to
recruitment materials. Eligible participants provided written
informed consent to complete enrollment and were emailed a
link to complete a self-report assessment online. Research staff
followed-up with participants to ensure timely completion. Par-
ticipants received a $25 gift card for completing the study. All
procedures were approved by the Georgetown University Insti-
tutional Review Board.
Measures
Demographics. Demographics included age, household income,
and educational attainment (5). Season of participation was also
recorded (spring/summer/fall/winter; ref. 21).
Skin cancer risk factors. Risk factors for melanoma and non-
melanoma skin cancer (32, 33) assessed included skin reactivity
to sun exposure (always/usually burn, rarely/never burn), hair
color (red/blonde, brown/black), and family history of mela-
noma (first-degree relative, yes/no). Intentional outdoor tan-
ning and sunburns were captured using items from epidemio-
logic surveys (34–36). Frequency of intentional outdoor tan-
ning was measured with an item assessing how often partici-
pants spend time in the sun to get a tan with response options
ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Sunburn was captured by
asking how often in the past 12 months participants experienced
red or painful sunburn that lasted a day or more, with response
options ranging from 0 to 5 or more.
Indoor tanning behavior and beliefs. Past-year frequency of indoor
tanning including sunlamps, tanning beds, and tanning booths
(1 or 2, 3–9, 10–19, 20 or more times) and age of indoor
tanning initiation were measured using valid items (5). Opioid-
like reactions to indoor tanning were measured with a 4-item
scale assessing how often participants feel relaxation, pain relief,
stress relief, and euphoria when they tan, with response options
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
Responses were averaged to create a score with higher values
indicating stronger opioid-like reactions (Cronbach a ¼ 0.83;
ref. 9).
Measures of indoor tanning beliefs captured constructs from
theoretical frameworks of health risk behavior and behavior
change (24–26). A 10-item scale assessed beliefs that the
benefits of indoor tanning outweigh the risks (27). Responses
were averaged to create a score with higher values indicating
perceived beliefs benefits outweighing potential risks (Cron-
bach a ¼ 0.77). Positive attitudes toward indoor tanning
were assessed with a 10-item scale (37, 38) with response
options ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly
agree). Responses were averaged to create a score with higher
values indicating more positive attitudes (Cronbach a ¼ 0.84).
Perceived severity of the risks of indoor tanning was mea-
sured using a 5-item scale assessing how serious participants
perceived the risks associated with indoor tanning to be (39).
Examples include "skin cancer isn't very serious" and "skin
cancer is always curable" with response options ranging from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Responses were
summed to create a score indicating higher perceived severity
(Cronbach a ¼ 0.73). Perceived susceptibility to the risks of
indoor tanning was measured with a 7-item scale capturing how
likely participants perceived the risks associated with indoor
tanning to be (39). Example items include "compared with
other females my age, I have a high chance of developing skin
cancer" and "I am likely to develop skin cancer at some point"
with response options ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5
(strongly agree). Responses were averaged to create a score
indicating higher perceived susceptibility (Cronbach a ¼ 0.73).
Behavioral and psychiatric comorbidity. Alcohol and tobacco use
were measured using items from epidemiologic surveys
(40, 41). Past 30-day alcohol use in the sample was common
(94%), so we analyzed binge drinking (�4 drinks on one or
more occasion, yes/no) in the past 30 days (41). Current
cigarette smoking (yes/no) was defined as smoking at least
100 lifetime cigarettes and now smoking every day or some
days (40).
Measures of psychiatric comorbidity were based on prior
studies of indoor tanning behavior and dependence (18, 37,
42, 43). Sensation seeking was measured using an 8-item scale
assessing participants' proclivity for risk-taking (44). Response
options ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)
and were averaged to create a score with higher values indicat-
ing greater sensation seeking (Cronbach a ¼ 0.81). Self-esteem
was captured with a 10-item scale with response options
ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree) (45).
Items were averaged to create a score indicative of higher self-
esteem (Cronbach a ¼ 0.91). Beliefs about physical appearance
were measured with a 12-item scale capturing physical appear-
ance orientation, or the value participants' place on their
appearance. Items were averaged to create a score with higher
values indicating stronger beliefs about physical appearance
(Cronbach a ¼ 0.86; ref. 46). Finally, depressive symptoms
were measured using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression scale (Cronbach a ¼ 0.91). A cutoff score of
�16 was used to indicate a positive screen for depressive
symptoms (yes/no; ref. 47).
Indoor tanning dependence. Two psychiatric screening instru-
ments modified from other forms of addiction assessed indoor
tanning dependence: the modified CAGE (mCAGE) and the
modified Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Dis-
orders-IV (mDSM) screeners (17, 18, 48). We chose these
screeners because they have demonstrated reliability and valid-
ity and evidence indicates use of their cutoff points in combi-
nation to define indoor tanning dependence performs similarly

 to other available measures, such as the Tanning Addiction
Pathology Scale and Structured Interview for Tanning Abuse
and Dependence (17). Some researchers have also expressed
concern that when administered alone the mCAGE may over-
estimate the prevalence of indoor tanning dependence (49),
leading others to recommend using the combination of screen-
ers to address limitations of using a single measure alone (23,
50). The mCAGE includes 4 items (Cut Down, Annoyed,
Guilty, Eye Opener), and endorsing �2 items affirmatively
indicates dependence symptoms. The mDSM includes 8 items
and endorsing 3 or more affirmatively indicates dependence
symptoms. Total scores on the mCAGE and mDSM were
moderately correlated (r ¼ 0.37, P < 0.001) indicating they
capture unique dependence symptoms. Indoor tanning depen-
dence was defined as screening positive on both the mCAGE
and mDSM (yes/no; refs. 23, 50).
Statistical analysis
Participant characteristics were described overall and by
indoor tanning dependence, and two-sample t tests and Pear-
son x2 tests were conducted to examine associations between
all independent variables measured and indoor tanning depen-
dence. Pair-wise correlations were also examined among all
independent variables measured; all were at most weakly
correlated (r < 0.30), indicating ignorable collinearity in mul-
tivariable models. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression
models were applied where indoor tanning dependence was
regressed on a subset of independent variables that showed
associations with indoor tanning dependence at P < 0.10 in
bivariate analyses. We chose this threshold for inclusion in
multivariable analyses because we aimed to choose from a large
set of candidate covariates that would comprise the optimal
multivariable model. This purposeful variable selection is
shown to have the capability of retaining important confound-
ing variables in multivariable analysis (51). Unadjusted and
adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
are reported. Goodness of fit for the multivariable model was
confirmed using the Hosmer–Lemeshow c2 test (52). To exam-
ine how sensitive our multivariable estimates were to the
choice of independent variables, an adjusted logistic regression
model including all independent variables was also created as
a supplementary analysis. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute).
Results
Sample characteristics
In total, 563 individuals were assessed for eligibility, 433
(76.9%) met eligibility criteria, and 389 (89.8% of those
eligible) completed study procedures. Overall, 22.6% (n ¼
88) of participants screened positive for indoor tanning depen-
dence. Participant characteristics overall and by indoor tanning
dependence are shown in Table 1. Overall, 46.7% (n ¼ 181)
of participants were current college or university students,
indicating the recruitment approach was successful reaching
young adults in the community and in college settings. The
prevalence of indoor tanning dependence symptoms assessed
in the full sample and by indoor tanning dependence screening
is shown in Table 2.
In bivariate analyses, those screening positive for indoor
tanning dependence were less likely to be college educated
(P ¼ 0.040), reported intentional outdoor tanning more fre-
quently (P ¼ 0.028), initiated indoor tanning at a younger age
on average (P < 0.001), and reported more frequent indoor
tanning in the past year (P < 0.001) compared with those
screening negative for indoor tanning dependence (Table 1).
Compared with those screening negative for indoor tanning
dependence, those screening positive also reported stronger
opioid-like reactions to indoor tanning (P ¼ 0.002), attitudes
and beliefs valuing the perceived benefits of indoor tanning
(P < 0.001), and greater perceived susceptibility to the risks
of indoor tanning (P < 0.001). Finally, those screening positive
for indoor tanning dependence endorsed poorer self-esteem
(P < 0.001), were more strongly oriented to their appearance
(P < 0.001), and were more likely to screen positive for
depressive symptoms (P < 0.001) compared with those screen-
ing negative for indoor tanning dependence (Table 1).
Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses of vari-
ables associated with indoor tanning dependence are shown
in Table 3. Unadjusted models mirrored results of bivariate
analyses. The adjusted multivariable model fit the data well
[Hosmer–Lemeshow c2 (8 df) ¼ 5.18, P ¼ 0.738]. After adjust-
ment for remaining variables, the estimated odds of indoor
tanning dependence decreased with increasing age of indoor
tanning initiation (aOR ¼ 0.85; 95% CI ¼ 0.74–0.97; P ¼
0.017) and the estimated odds were three times greater among
those reporting indoor tanning �20 or more times in the past
year (aOR ¼ 3.03; 95% CI ¼ 1.11–8.32; P ¼ 0.015) compared
with those reporting indoor tanning 1 or 2 times in the past
year (Table 3). The estimated odds of indoor tanning depen-
dence showed a 2-fold increase with beliefs valuing the benefits
of indoor tanning over the risks (aOR ¼ 2.15; 95% CI, 1.28–
3.61; P ¼ 0.004) and increased with greater perceived suscep-
tibility to the risks of indoor tanning (aOR ¼ 2.72; 95% CI,
1.67–4.42; P < 0.001). Finally, the estimated odds of indoor
tanning dependence increased with stronger appearance orien-
tation (aOR ¼ 1.73; 95% CI, 1.03–2.90; P ¼ 0.037) and were
nearly four times greater for those screening positive for depres-
sive symptoms (aOR ¼ 3.79; 95% CI, 1.90–7.57; P < 0.001)
relative to those screening negative for depressive symptoms.
We also fitted the adjusted logistic model by regressing indoor
tanning dependence onto all variables shown in Table 1 and
the results were consistent with those displayed in Table 3
(Supplementary Table S1).
Discussion
Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that some young
people develop behavioral addiction to indoor tanning. In pre-
clinical models, prolonged exposure to UV light in mice leads to
elevated plasma b-endorphin and increased pain tolerance, and
when removed opioid withdrawal symptoms and conditioned
choice behavior to mitigate withdrawal occur (10). These effects
are absent in mice exposed to non-UV light, b-endorphin knock-
out mice, and with pharmacologic opioid antagonism (10). In
clinical studies, frequent indoor tanners endorse subjective pref-
erence for UV light over sham light when blinded to the source
(12, 16), and this preference diminishes with pharmacologic
opioid antagonism (16). Exposure to UV light among frequent
tanners has been shown to activate reward-based brain regions
(13) and to produce increased dopamine response (11) similar to
other forms of addiction. Frequent indoor tanners have also been

 observed to endorse responses characteristic of drug exposure
after tanning, such as improved mood and euphoria (14, 15).
This study contributes to this research by assessing factors
associated with indoor tanning dependence in a community
sample of non-Hispanic white young adult women. More than
1 of 5 women in the sample met screening criteria for indoor
tanning dependence, and as expected based on prior research
(15, 18, 48, 53) indoor tanning dependence was associated
with an earlier age of indoor tanning initiation and more
frequent indoor tanning behavior. This indicates women who
develop indoor tanning dependence are at a high risk of skin
cancer based on their behavioral profile (3, 4, 7, 8). Our study
also shows that, in addition to these behavioral features, indoor
tanning dependence is associated with psychiatric risk factors,
including stronger physical appearance orientation and depres-
sive symptoms, and beliefs favoring the perceived benefits of
indoor tanning.
Research with female college/university students has shown
that indoor tanning dependence is associated psychiatric comor-
bidities including anxiety (20) and obsessive compulsive (18)
disorders and that frequent indoor tanning is associated with
seasonal affective disorder (54). Our work extends this evidence
by demonstrating indoor tanning dependence is associated with
depressive symptoms in young adults in the community who are
likely to be encountered in clinical settings other than college
health centers. The strength of association was greater than studies
reporting comorbidities associated with nondependent tanning
behavior and comparable with those reported for indoor tanning
dependence (18, 20, 54). This evidence, in conjunction with
research indicating indoor tanning can produce mood-enhancing
effects (11, 14, 15), suggests a potential mechanism whereby
young women experiencing depressed mood or other psychologic
distress may indoor tan because it alleviates such symptoms.
However, there remains a need for research to understand how

Our findings demonstrating an association between stronger
physical appearance orientation and indoor tanning depen-
dence build on research indicating frequent sun exposure and
infrequent sun protection are associated with similar beliefs
among young adults (42). This result is also consistent with
evidence indicating the perceived appearance-related benefit is
a motivating factor for indoor tanning among young people
(30, 55). Our data suggest this association may extend beyond

 the direct benefits perceived to be gained from indoor tanning
to
an
underlying
preoccupation
with
appearance.
Some
research has also demonstrated that nondependent indoor
tanning behavior among female college/university students is
associated with lower perceived risks and greater perceived
benefits of indoor tanning (19, 30). To our knowledge, this
study is among the first to show that beliefs about the benefits
and risks of indoor tanning demonstrate a similar strength of
association with indoor tanning dependence even when
accounting for other associated factors. In the sample, indoor
tanning dependence was associated with a pattern of beliefs
indicating young women recognize their tanning behavior
increases susceptibility to risks such as skin cancer, but believe
the perceived benefits of indoor tanning outweigh the risks.
Some of our findings differ from previous research, particularly
those relating to alcohol and tobacco use, which we did not find to
be associated with indoor tanning dependence. Other studies
have shown that indoor tanning dependence is associated with
alcohol use disorders (20), more frequent alcohol use (22), and
cigarette smoking (53). Differences in measurement approaches
(e.g., brief epidemiologic items versus clinical alcohol use disor-
der assessments) and samples (e.g., students vs. students and non-
students) may contribute to these variable findings.
Our study points to the need to develop clinical approaches
for effectively identifying and intervening with young women
who endorse frequent indoor tanning, may meet criteria for
dependence, and are likely to experience distress, depression,
and other comorbidities. Studies have investigated the validity
of measures of indoor tanning dependence other than those
used here (56, 57), but the optimal screening approach is yet to
be identified. Measures such as those used in this study have
been adapted from other forms of addiction but will need
refinement as research uncovers unique features of indoor
tanning dependence, including comorbid factors and potential
biological underpinnings (50, 58).
Interventions have targeted young adults generally and those
with any history of indoor tanning using web- and print-based
education to address perceived risks and benefits of tanning and
appearance-based motives (38, 59–62). Although interventions
aimed at affecting perceived risks and benefits of health behaviors
have promising effects generally (26, 63) and in some studies of
indoor tanning (61, 64), our findings suggest this approach alone
may be insufficient to promote behavior change among young
adults endorsing indoor tanning dependence. A recent review
proposes skills-based cognitive behavioral and motivational
interventions that have shown promise for addressing other
behavioral addictions could be adapted to address "excessive
tanning" (65). However, evidence on the design and delivery
of interventions targeting young adults endorsing indoor tan-
ning dependence, which our data indicate is characterized
by frequent indoor tanning, protanning beliefs, and psychiatric
comorbidity, is extremely limited. Our findings highlight a
need to develop and test intervention strategies targeting a
constellation of factors associated with indoor tanning depen-
dence that may be distinct from those associated with indoor
tanning behavior generally, including approaches addressing
underlying psychiatric comorbidity.
This study is one of the largest community samples to charac-
terize correlates of indoor tanning dependence in non-Hispanic
white young adult women to date. However, the findings should
be interpreted in light of study limitations. The data are self-report
and subject to potential reporting biases, and the cross-sectional
design does not provide evidence on the causal associations with
indoor tanning dependence. The convenience sample from a
single geographic location and study inclusion criteria limit
generalizability to broader populations, including young women
of other racial/ethnic groups and young men. The prevalence of
indoor tanning dependence in our sample is higher than some
previous studies; however, most have involved general samples
not young women with a history of indoor tanning in the past year
(18, 20, 43). We observed a higher prevalence of indoor tanning
dependence on the mDSM than the mCAGE, which is contrary to
criticisms of the mCAGE (49) and may be a reflection of differ-
ences in performance of tanning dependence measures in general
samples versus those who have recently indoor tanned. Although
the study used reliable and valid measures of indoor tanning
dependence, identification of correlates of indoor tanning depen-
dence may depend on the measures used and future studies
examining correlates using other measures such as the Tanning
Addiction and Pathology Scale and the Structured Interview for
Tanning Abuse and Dependence (17) are needed.
Despite these limitations, the study findings indicate indoor
tanning dependence among non-Hispanic white young adult
women is associated with a behavioral profile indicating an
elevated risk of skin cancer, protanning beliefs, and psychiatric
comorbidity. The findings highlight a critical need to develop
models for effectively identifying and intervening with this high-
risk group in clinical and community settings.
