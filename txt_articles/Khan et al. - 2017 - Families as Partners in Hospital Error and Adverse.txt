IMPORTANCE Medical errors and adverse events (AEs) are common among hospitalized
children. While clinician reports are the foundation of operational hospital safety surveillance
and a key component of multifaceted research surveillance, patient and family reports are
not routinely gathered. We hypothesized that a novel family-reporting mechanism would
improve incident detection.
OBJECTIVE To compare error and AE rates (1) gathered systematically with vs without family
reporting, (2) reported by families vs clinicians, and (3) reported by families vs hospital
incident reports.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a prospective cohort study including
the parents/caregivers of 989 hospitalized patients 17 years and younger (total 3902
patient-days) and their clinicians from December 2014 to July 2015 in 4 US pediatric centers.
Clinician abstractors identified potential errors and AEs by reviewing medical records,
hospital incident reports, and clinician reports as well as weekly and discharge Family Safety
Interviews (FSIs). Two physicians reviewed and independently categorized all incidents,
rating severity and preventability (agreement, 68%-90%; κ, 0.50-0.68). Discordant
categorizations were reconciled. Rates were generated using Poisson regression estimated
via generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures on the same patient.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Error and AE rates.
RESULTS Overall, 746 parents/caregivers consented for the study. Of these, 717 completed FSIs.
Their median (interquartile range) age was 32.5 (26-40) years; 380 (53.0%) were nonwhite,
566 (78.9%) were female, 603 (84.1%) were English speaking, and 380 (53.0%) had attended
college. Of 717 parents/caregivers completing FSIs, 185 (25.8%) reported a total of 255
incidents, which were classified as 132 safety concerns (51.8%), 102 nonsafety-related quality
concerns (40.0%), and 21 other concerns (8.2%). These included 22 preventable AEs (8.6%), 17
nonharmful medical errors (6.7%), and 11 nonpreventable AEs (4.3%) on the study unit. In total,
179 errors and 113 AEs were identified from all sources. Family reports included 8 otherwise
unidentified AEs, including 7 preventable AEs. Error rates with family reporting (45.9 per 1000
patient-days) were 1.2-fold (95% CI, 1.1-1.2) higher than rates without family reporting (39.7 per
1000 patient-days). Adverse event rates with family reporting (28.7 per 1000 patient-days)
were 1.1-fold (95% CI, 1.0-1.2; P=.006) higher than rates without (26.1 per 1000 patient-days).
Families and clinicians reported similar rates of errors (10.0 vs 12.8 per 1000 patient-days;
relative rate, 0.8; 95% CI, .5-1.2) and AEs (8.5 vs 6.2 per 1000 patient-days; relative rate, 1.4;
95% CI, 0.8-2.2). Family-reported error rates were 5.0-fold (95% CI, 1.9-13.0) higher and AE
rates 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.2-6.7) higher than hospital incident report rates.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Families provide unique information about hospital safety
and should be included in hospital safety surveillance in order to facilitate better design and
assessment of interventions to improve safety.

etween 44 000 and 440 000 patients are estimated
to die yearly in the United States due to medical
errors,1-4 making medical errors a leading cause of
death. Detecting medical errors is important for identifying
causative factors and measuring the effectiveness of preven-
tion strategies. Error detection methodologies have greatly
advanced over the past few decades.5-7 However, implemen-
tation of error detection, or safety surveillance, varies across
hospitals.
Hospital incident reports, which are voluntary and suffer
from underreporting, are commonly used but only capture a
small subset of errors and adverse events (AEs), ie, harms due
to medical care.8-12 Trigger tools are higher yield and becom-
ing more sophisticated at identifying events but are not yet
widely used.13 Prospective systematic surveillance, in which
trained research staff conduct daily reviews of patient medi-
cal records (Figure 1), is the most effective way to measure
errors but is expensive and typically limited to research
settings.5,14,15
Patients and families are absent both from hospital inci-
dent reports and systematic surveillance. Limited adult stud-
ies suggest that patients are a fruitful source of safety
surveillance.16,17 Small, single-center pediatric studies sug-
gest similar findings; however, the role of patients and fami-
lies in pediatric safety reporting has not been widely
examined.18-20 Additionally, to our knowledge, a rigorous pa-
tient and family error-reporting methodology has not been de-
veloped or operationalized.
We sought to fill these gaps by developing a family error-
reporting methodology and testing its utility and effective-
nessinsystematicsafetysurveillanceacross4USpediatrichos-
pitals. We hypothesized that families would report errors and
AEs not discovered by other methods and that adding a fam-
ily reporting mechanism to systematic surveillance method-
ology would increase error and AE detection. If these hypoth-
eses are correct, then adding families to safety surveillance
systems would provide an important new way to detect er-
rors, identify their causes, and measure the effectiveness of
efforts to prevent them.
Methods
Data, Setting, and Study Population
We conducted a prospective cohort study in 4 pediatric hos-
pitals. Data were collected from December 2014 to July 2015
coincident with data collection for the Patient and Family Cen-
tered I-PASS Study, an ongoing multicenter investigation of
clinician-family communication and safety built on prior
communication and safety research.21
Study participants included parents/guardians or care-
givers(eg,grandparentslivinginthehome)andclinicians(resi-
dent-physicians and nurses) of 989 hospitalized medical pa-
tients 17 years and younger on inpatient general pediatric and
subspecialtyunits.Weobtainedwritteninformedconsentfrom
clinicians, verbal consent using an information sheet from par-
ents/caregivers, and a waiver of informed consent to review
patient records. The Boston Children’
s Hospital Institutional
Review Board and each participating institution’
s institu-
tional review board approved the study.
Inclusions
Given limited translation and interpretation resources, we in-
cluded parents/caregivers speaking English, Spanish, Arabic,
Chinese, or Russian (the most commonly spoken languages
across study sites).
Family Safety Interviews
We developed the Family Safety Interview (FSI) using a modi-
fied Delphi method with input from experts in survey meth-
odology, patient safety, and health literacy, as well as family
partners. Draft versions of the FSI were pilot tested through
cognitive interviews with parents/caregivers at Boston Chil-
dren’
s Hospital.
To orient families to types of information to report, the FSI
began with descriptions, definitions, and examples of safety
events related to medications, miscommunications, diagno-
ses,delaysincare,complicationsofcare,andequipment.Using
closed-endedandopen-endedquestions,itthenaskedparents/
caregivers to indicate whether the child’
s illness worsened or
almost worsened because (1) of medical care (ie, an AE),

The established 2-step, prospective, systematic surveillance methodology
currently considered highest yield for detecting errors and AEs in safety
surveillance research.5,14,15 Notably, patients and families are absent from this
process. Our study integrated family safety reports into the first step of this
process.
Key Points
Question How do rates of family-reported errors and adverse
events (AEs) compare with those detected by other sources of
hospital safety reporting that do not typically include families?
Findings In this cohort study including 746 parents/caregivers of
989 hospitalized pediatric patients, families reported similar rates
of errors and AEs as clinicians, and families reported 5-fold more
errors and 3-fold more AEs than hospital incident reports.
Including families in prospective systematic surveillance increased
overall error detection rates by 16% and AE detection rates by
10%.
Meaning Families provide unique safety information and have the
potential to be valuable partners in safety surveillance conducted
by both hospitals and researchers.

 (2) something was not done that should have been (ie, a pre-
ventable AE due to an error of omission), or (3) something was
done that should not have been (ie, a preventable AE due to
an error of commission). It also asked if a mistake occurred that
didnotresultinharm(ie,anonharmfulerror)andwhetherany-
thing else happened or almost happened that was upsetting
or could have harmed the child.
Research assistants administered this semistructured in-
terview to parents/caregivers of eligible patients every 7 days
while hospitalized and before discharge. Interviews typically
lasted 3 to 5 minutes when no concerns were reported and
10 to 15 minutes when concerns were reported. Research cli-
nicians (nurses or physicians) then classified family re-
sponses as safety concerns (ie, potential errors and AEs), non-
safety-related quality concerns (eg, an unpleasant interaction
with a physician), or other concerns (eg, a difficult intrave-
nous placement). Off-unit (eg, emergency department) safety
concerns were subsequently excluded from analyses.
Clinician Event Reporting Surveys
Clinician event reporting was conducted by modifying an
instrument used in previous studies.21,22 This less-than-
1-minute survey asked respondents to describe errors and
AEs or procedures, medications, fluids, or other therapies
that were unnecessary or questionably beneficial, delayed,
involved in an error or AE, or ordered erroneously but inter-
cepted before reaching the patient (near-misses). They also
asked about resident or nurse sign-out omissions or inaccu-
racies leading to problems with patient care. Every weekday
morning, research clinicians administered the survey (ver-
bally or on paper) to outgoing overnight residents. Surveys
were also posted on the study units to allow unit staff, par-
ticularly nurses, not enrolled in the study to voluntarily
report anonymously.
Error Validation/Classification
To identify potential errors and AEs, research clinicians
conducted systematic surveillance using a validated
methodology21-26 (ie, daily review of all study-unit patients’
medical records, hospital incident reports, and clinician
event reporting surveys) (Figure 1). These data were supple-
mented with incidents collected during FSIs. For potential
errors and AEs, research clinicians recorded reporting
source(s) (ie, family, clinician, observation by study person-
nel, or other), preceding events, patient outcomes, harm
level (using modified National Coordinating Council for
Medication Error Reporting and Prevention categorization27),
preventability (if harmful), error category, and follow-up
actions.

level27 (preconsensus agreement, 89.5%; κ, 0.68) and prevent-
ability (preconsensus agreement, 83.7%; κ, 0.60). Physician
reviewer pairs reconciled discordant categorizations through
consensus.
Demographic Data
We collected clinician and parent/caregiver demographic in-
formation through surveys. We obtained patient clinical and
sociodemographic characteristics data from hospital admin-
istrative data.
Outcomes and Predictors
Our primary outcome was overall medical error and AE rates
per 1000 patient-days (days hospitalized on the study unit)
both including and excluding family reporting (ie, FSI data).
We also analyzed error and AE rates per 100 admissions. We
secondarily analyzed error and AE rates reported by families
vs clinicians and by families vs hospital incident reports. We
identified the following a priori variables as potential predic-
tors of family reporting: patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, in-
surance, complex chronic conditions (CCCs, a marker of medi-
cal complexity according to International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification28), and parent/
caregiver age, sex, race/ethnicity, language, education, and
household income.
Statistical Analyses
To compare error and AE rates (overall with vs without family
data, family vs clinician, and family vs hospital incident re-
port), we used Poisson regression estimated via generalized
estimating equations to account for correlation arising from
collecting parent/caregiver, clinician, and hospital incident re-
ports on the same patient. All 989 sample patients were used
for the overall and family vs clinician analyses. The family vs
hospital incident report analysis only included the 3 sites with
available hospital incident report data.
Inunadjustedandadjustedanalyses,wecomparedfamily-
reported error and AE rates per 1000 patient-days using bias-
corrected Poisson regression, which has better statistical prop-
erties than usual Poisson regression when the total number of
events is not large.29,30 A priori parent/caregiver-level and pa-
tient-level predictors of interest that were significant (P < .05)
in unadjusted analyses were fit in an adjusted model. The fi-
nal adjusted model only included predictors with P < .05. Site
effects were considered as fixed effects in the adjusted model.
For consistency, final adjusted models for errors and AEs
contained the same predictors.
Unadjusted and adjusted analyses included only the 717
patients whose parents/caregivers completed FSIs, which we
refer to as a complete-case analysis. Because FSIs were not
completed for all study-unit patients, we compared patient
characteristics among those with and without completed
FSIs. Additionally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using
a reweighted estimating equation missing data approach to
determine if complete-cases produced biased results. In the
reweighted estimating equations approach, we fit a logistic
regression model to determine predictors of a parent/
caregiver completing an interview (using all nonmissing
variables). Then, complete-cases were reweighted by the
inverse probability of a parent/caregiver completing an inter-
view. Thus, patients whose parents/caregivers completed
interviews despite being less likely to complete them were
up-weighted to account for those similar parents/caregivers

collect and manage study data and SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute) for analyses.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Of 1024 patients on the study units, 989 met study criteria
(eFigure in the Supplement). Parents/caregivers of 782 eli-
gible patients (79.1%) were available and therefore ap-
proached. Most parents/caregivers (746 [95.4%]) who were
approached consented for the study. Of these, 717 parents/
caregivers completed 763 interviews (35 parents/caregivers
completed more than 1 interview). Among clinicians, 146
nurses (98.6%) and 207 resident-physicians (95.4%) con-
sented for the study. A total of 717 of 782 eligible parents/
caregivers (91.7%) completed FSIs. Overall, 77 residents com-
pleted a total of 284 of 327 (86.9%) solicited postshift event
reportingsurveys,withresidentscompleting0-11surveyseach.
Patient, parent/caregiver, and clinician demographic data
are reported in Table 1. Patients and parents/caregivers were
from varied racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds.
Overall, 243 of 989 patients (24.6%) had 1 or more CCCs. Pa-
tients without completed FSIs (primarily because parents/
caregivers were not present) were similar to patients with com-
pletedFSIsintermsofage,CCCs,race/ethnicity,insurance,and
error and AE rates. Patient sex was the only statistically sig-
nificant difference between these 2 groups.
Errors and AEs
We found a total of 179 errors and 113 AEs on our study units
through all sources. Families reported 39 of 179 total errors
(21.8%;19[10.6%]uniquelyand20[11.2%]incombinationwith
anothersource)and33of113totalAEs(29.2%;8[7.1%]uniquely
and 25 [22.1%] in combination with another source) (Figure 2).
Family Reports
Overall, 185 parents/caregivers (25.8%) reported 255 total in-
cidents, of which we classified 132 (51.8%) as safety concerns,
102 (40.0%) as nonsafety-related quality concerns, and
21 (8.2%) as other concerns. Of reported safety concerns, 35
occurred off-unit and were excluded from further analyses;
97 (73.5%) occurred on-unit. On 2-step review, 50 family-
reported on-unit errors and/or AEs were confirmed, includ-
ing 22 preventable AEs, 17 nonharmful medical errors, and
11 nonpreventable AEs.
Family reports included 8 otherwise unidentified AEs,
including 7 preventable AEs. Unique family-reported AEs in-
cluded multiple needle sticks, inadequate suctioning, and ad-
verse effects from medication (Table 2). Of 39 validated family-
reported errors (ie, preventable AEs and nonharmful errors),
20 were also detected through research clinician medical rec-
ord review, 3 through resident report, 2 through nurse report,
and 1 through hospital incident report. Of 33 validated family-
reported AEs, 25 were also detected through medical record
review, 3 through nurse report, 2 through resident report, and
2 through hospital incident report.

 Family-reported AEs most commonly involved tempo-
rary patient harm requiring intervention (28 [84.9%]) or pro-
longing hospitalization (5 [15.2%]). Both family-reported and
nonfamily-reported errors and AEs were primarily medica-
tion related.
Overall Error and AE Rates With
vs Without Family-Reporting
Overall error rates with family reporting were 15.5% (95% CI,
9.0%-22.3%) higher than without. Overall AE rates with fam-
ily reporting were 9.8% (95% CI, 3.1%-16.9%) higher than with-
out (Table 3).
Family-Reported vs Clinician-Reported Errors and AEs
Family-reported error rates were equivalent to clinician-
reported rates (relative rate [RR], 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5-1.2). Family-
reported AE rates were also equivalent to clinician-reported
rates (RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.8-2.2) (Table 4).

 errors (22.5%). Of 71 AEs detected through all sources, hospi-
tal incident reports detected 7 AEs (9.9%) and family reports
detected 20 AEs (28.2%).
Family-reported error rates were 5.0-fold (95% CI, 1.9-
13.0) higher than hospital incident report rates across these
sites. Family-reported AE rates were 2.9-fold (95% CI, 1.2-6.7)
higher than hospital incident report rates (Table 5).
Predictors of Family-Reported Errors and AEs
Results of the weighted estimated approach accounting for
missing data were similar to unweighted results; for simplic-
ity, we report only unweighted results. Unadjusted predic-
tors of family-reported errors included patient age, 1 or more
CCCs, parent/caregiver proficiency in written and spoken Eng-
lish, and higher parent/caregiver education (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Adjusted predictors of family-reported errors in-
cluded younger patient age (RR, 0.9 per 1-year increment; 95%
CI, 0.9-1.0), 1 or more CCCs (RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.8), older par-
ent/caregiver age (RR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.0-1.1), and higher parent/
caregiver education (less than high school vs college educa-
tion: RR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.3) (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Unadjusted predictors of family-reported AEs include 1 or
moreCCCs,higherparent/caregivereducation,andgreaterfam-
ily presence during hospitalization. Adjusted predictors of
family-reported AEs included 1 or more CCCs (RR, 2.3; 95% CI,
1.1-4.8) and higher parent/caregiver education (less than high
school vs college education: RR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.4).
Discussion
In a study of 4 US hospitals, solicited family reporting yielded
5-fold more errors and 3-fold more AEs than the voluntary hos-
pital incident reports that most hospitals use as their primary
patient safety surveillance tool. Additionally, we found that
family reporting substantively enhanced rigorous multifac-
eted patient safety surveillance methods, with families report-
ing patient safety incidents that were not otherwise de-
tected.Ourfindingthatfamilyreportingincreasedoverallerror
detection by 16% and AE detection by 10%—compared with
what is typically considered the highest-yield methodology in
safety surveillance research—supports our hypothesis that in-
cluding families in safety surveillance improves safety detec-
tion. This represents an important patient safety innovation.
By including families in safety reporting, we can identify oth-
erwise unrecognized errors and AEs, providing new opportu-
nities to prevent them from occurring.
Our study’
s family-reported error and AE rates are far
higher than rates detected through clinician-only, voluntary
hospitalincidentreports,whichtypicallyonlydetect1%to14%
ofAEs.8,14Wesimilarlyfoundthathospitalincidentreportsonly
captured 5% of errors and 10% of AEs. In contrast, our family-
reporting methodology was much higher yield, detecting 22%
of errors and 29% of AEs. This may be because families are
available to provide patient safety information and may in fact
have more opportunity to provide such reports than clini-
cians, who might be prevented from reporting by competing
time demands.34,35 We additionally found that 49% of family-
reported errors and 24% of family-reported AEs were not pres-
ent in the medical record, consistent with prior studies.14,16-18
Based on other studies, patient and family safety-
reporting rates are variable and appear related to mode of re-
porting. The percentage of families in our study reporting in-
cidents(26%)wasapproximately3-foldhigherthaninourprior
Table 2. Examples of Errors and Adverse Events (AEs)
by Reporting Source
Error
AE
Family-Reported Only
Toddler with Kawasaki disease whose
diagnosis of pleural effusion and
pulmonary edema and treatment with
furosemide was delayed by 12 h despite
parent reporting rapid breathing and an
unusual sound coming from the chest
much earlier in the day.
Infant with bronchiolitis requiring
intensive care admission for high
flow nasal cannula who, on transfer
back to the unit, was found by
mother to have swaddler wrapped
around her neck, vomiting,
choking, and having difficulty
breathing. Nurse did not suction
the patient as requested by mother.
Clinician-Reported Only
Teenaged patient with cystic fibrosis
exacerbation admitted with elevated
creatinine level who received a bolus
of D5 NS + 20KCl despite nurse raising
concerns with overnight resident that
the patient had an elevated creatinine
level and that the nurse had never
administered this solution as a bolus
before.
School-aged child with a metabolic
disorder admitted for pancreatitis
whose pain medication was
delayed because an inappropriate
rate of hydromorphone was
ordered for the patient-controlled
analgesia (PCA).
Reported by Both Family and Clinician
Teenaged patient with inflammatory
bowel disease on ketamine drip for pain
control whose pump settings were
incorrectly entered, resulting in patient
receiving 3-fold the appropriate rate
overnight.
Toddler admitted with fever and
dehydration in the setting of
Streptococcus, adenovirus, and
coronavirus infection who
experienced a 10-h delay in
ordering maintenance IV fluids
after parent alerted nurse about
decreased oral intake and urination.
Later that evening, patient
experienced an IV infiltrate, after
which there was another 10-h
delay before IV fluids were
restarted. This resulted in
symptomatic dehydration,
including tachycardia and dry
mucus membranes, requiring need
for additional IV fluid boluses.
Medical Record Review Only
Teenaged patient with migraines
admitted for dihydroergotamine
infusion who was ordered for an
incorrect dose of medication by
overnight resident, who had not
examined the patient or conferred
with neurology. Dose was corrected
before reaching patient.
Neonate admitted with a brief
resolved unexplained event (BRUE)
and cough in the setting of
rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial
virus infection who began to
worsen and have desaturations and
apneas. A chest radiograph was
ordered (but not obtained), and
the patient was transferred to the
ICU for 4 d. Two d after being
transferred from the ICU back to
the general pediatric unit, the
patient again developed apnea and
desaturations, prompting septic
workup and a chest radiograph,
which revealed a right upper lobe
pneumonia, for which the patient
was subsequently treated with
IV antibiotics.

 single-center study (9%),18 in which we used written family
discharge experience surveys (vs the active semistructured
family interviews used in our current study). Additionally, our
currentstudy’
sreportingrateismorethan600-foldhigherthan
that of a voluntary prototype consumer-reporting hotline that
was tested with funding from the Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality in 2 hospital institutions in a single state
and administered via the web and telephone (0.04%; Denise
Quigley, PhD, email communication, June 2016).36
Priorstudiesusingactivepatientandfamilyreportingsimi-
larly found that 23% to 49% of patients and families reported
safety concerns.16,17,19 These studies used various methods,
including postdischarge patient telephone interviews,16
computer-based safety-reporting parent discharge surveys,17
and in-person patient/caregiver interviews 2 to 3 times per
week.19 An important difference between our study and these
is that we subsequently validated family safety reporting
using a rigorous 2-step methodology. Our validation step rep-
resents an important advance in medical error and AE report-
ing methodology.
Further research is needed to determine the best process
for operationalizing patient and family reporting in hospitals
and to assess its feasibility, success, and safety implications.
While less intensive than systematic surveillance, gathering
patient and family safety reports requires hospital personnel
time and effort. Time and effort may vary depending on
whether postdischarge interviews or in-hospital surveys are
used, for instance. Further research is required to compare and
weigh yield and costs of different approaches. While we em-
ployed research assistants for this purpose in our study, it is
plausible that, if they felt it worthwhile, hospitals might use
existing quality improvement staff to administer family safety
surveys or interviews. Hospitals might additionally consider
incorporating safety reporting into their existing family sur-
veys, thereby leveraging existing resources, although the sen-
sitivity of this approach would need to be further evaluated.
The effects of patient and family safety reporting on out-
comes, such as malpractice risk, parent experience, and sub-
sequent hospital improvement efforts, are unknown. Re-
search suggests that disclosing errors of which patients are
unaware does not lead to more malpractice cases.37-40 It seems
unlikely that gathering patient and family reports of errors of
which patients are already aware would increase malpractice
risk. Moreover, engaging patients and families may drive hos-
pitals to bridge the gap between safety reporting and improve-
ment. Involving patients and families may increase transpar-
encyandaccountabilityofsafetyreportingandtherebyaddress
criticisms that safety reports are not consistently acted on.41

 Given our finding that families of children with 1 or more
CCCs were more likely to report errors and AEs, actively part-
nering with families of patients with CCCs may be a high-
yield approach to detecting and perhaps preventing medical
errors and AEs. Patients with CCCs experience higher rates of
errorsandAEsowingtoincreasedillnesscomplexityandlength
of stay.17,18,42,43 Their families may also be more activated or
better understand the medical system,44 making them par-
ticularly high-yield reporters. However, it is also important for
hospitals to make concerted efforts to actively engage all fami-
lies in safety reporting and, in particular, to engage less edu-
cated and other vulnerable populations.
Limitations
Our study had several limitations. We included patients from
general pediatric and subspecialty services, not surgical ser-
vices, at 4 hospitals. Therefore, our reporting rates may not be
generalizable to all hospitals or services. However, family and
caregiver reporting may be broadly applicable to other pa-
tient populations (eg, adult, surgical, and geriatric). Al-
though we used a rigorous methodology using a well-
established 2-step review process with kappas similar to or
higher than prior studies,21 rating errors and AEs is complex.
Additionally, families reported a number of off-unit (eg, emer-
gency department) safety concerns beyond our study’
s scope
to further investigate. Our rates of validated family-reported
errors and AEs may have been even higher had we done so.
Conclusions
We developed and studied a novel family-reporting method-
ology that suggests families may be useful partners in hospi-
tal safety reporting. They report events not otherwise de-
tected or documented, including preventable AEs. Family
reporting increases error and AE rates detected through vol-
untary hospital incident reporting systems used by most hos-
pitals and systematic safety surveillance used in research—
both of which typically exclude patients and families. Actively
surveying families about safety may be a fruitful way to gather
errors and AEs—for both hospital safety improvement and
research.
