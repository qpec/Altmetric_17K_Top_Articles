Background and Purpose  The risk of vitamin D deficiency varies with the season. The fre-
quency of vitamin D deficiency in migraine patients and its association with migraine are un-
clear.
Methods  We retrospectively evaluated first-visit migraine patients between January 2016 and 
May 2017, and investigated the demographics, season, migraine subtypes, frequency, severity, 
and impact of migraine, psychological and sleep variables, climate factors, and vitamin D lev-
els. The nonfasting serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was measured to determine 
the vitamin D level, with deficiency of vitamin D defined as a concentration of <20 ng/mL. 
Results  In total, 157 patients with migraine aged 37.0±8.6 years (mean±standard deviation) 
were analyzed. Their serum level of vitamin D was 15.9±7.4 ng/mL. Vitamin D deficiency was 
present in 77.1% of the patients, and occurred more frequently in spring and winter than in 
summer and autumn (89.1%, 85.7%, 72.4%, and 61.7%, respectively; p=0.008). In multivariate 
Poisson regression analysis, monthly headache was 1.203 times (95% confidence interval= 
1.046–1.383, p=0.009) more frequent in patients with vitamin D deficiency than in those with-
out deficiency after adjusting for demographics, season, migraine subtype, depression, anxiety, 
and sleep quality. These associations were consistently noted in subgroup analysis of episodic 
migraine (odds ratio=1.266, p=0.033) and chronic migraine (odds ratio=1.390, p=0.041).
Conclusions  Our study found that a larger number of monthly days with headache was related 
to vitamin D deficiency among migraineurs. Future studies should attempt to confirm the causal 
relationship between vitamin D deficiency and migraine.

Effect of Vitamin D Deficiency on the Frequency 
of Headaches in Migraine
INTRODUCTION
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with chronic pain disorder, depression, and several neu-
rological disorders.1-6 The brain has an abundance of vitamin D receptors and there is evi-
dence of a nonskeletal role of vitamin D in inflammation, immunity, and the metabolism of 
neurotransmitters.6-8 In addition, vitamin D has been associated with severe headache and 
is considered a potential prophylactic agent or adjuvant in the management of migraine.9-11 
The serum level of vitamin D is related to sun exposure (as determined by latitude, out-
door physical activity, and sun-seeking or avoidance behavior), dietary intake, and genetic 
components.6,12 Migraineurs tend to avoid sunlight due to photophobia during an attack, and 
low physical activity and long working hours reportedly increase the risk of headache or 
migraine.13,14 The risks of both vitamin D deficiency and migraine have been shown to 
vary with latitude, suggesting the need to investigate the association of vitamin D deficien-
cy with migraine frequency.15 
Previous studies investigating vitamin D deficiency in migraine had limitations such as

lack of adjustment for seasonal variation, climate, or other 
variables, and the absence of appropriate headache param-
eters.16-18 A cross-sectional study suggested that the vitamin 
D level is lower in migraine patients than in nonheadache 
controls among nonsmokers, but it did not evaluate the as-
sociation of vitamin D levels with the severity of headache.19 
Therefore, the association of vitamin D and migraine needs to 
be investigated using comprehensive headache parameters, 
seasonal consideration, and psychological comorbidities. 
The present study investigated the frequency of vitamin D 
deficiency in migraine patients and the relationship between 
vitamin D deficiency and headache parameters.
METHODS
Subjects
This study was conducted in the Department of Neurology 
at the University Hospital of Hwaseong, Korea, in an urban 
setting at latitude 37° N. The study performed a retrospective 
review of prospective headache registry records of patients 
who presented for the first time with complaints of head-
ache between January 2016 and May 2017. The inclusion 
criteria were as follows: 1) migraine with aura, migraine 
without aura, chronic migraine, and probable migraine di-
agnosed according to the third edition of the International 
Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3),20 2) aged 
19–65 years, 3) detailed information available about the 
headache and psychological status obtained a self-adminis-
tered questionnaire, and 4) measurement of the vitamin D 
level. The exclusion criteria were 1) the presence of second-
ary headaches due to causes other than medication overuse, 
2) incomplete questionnaire data, 3) use of preventive medi-
cation for migraine, or 4) duration of more than 1 month 
between the vitamin D measurement and assessment of the 
migraine status. 
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the 
Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital Institutional Review Board/
Ethic Committee (IRB No. 2016-10-439) and conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clin-
ical Practice guidelines. All participants were kept fully in-
formed during the clinical procedures. The Institutional Re-
view Board waived the need to obtain informed consent due 
to this being a post-hoc analysis of collected clinical data and 
the guarantee of anonymity of personal data.
Demographics data and questionnaire 
Migraine was diagnosed by an investigator based on clinical 
history, a neurological examination, and laboratory or imag-
ing data, as appropriate. Migraine with aura, migraine without 
aura, and probable migraine were classified into episodic mi-
graine. Demographics data including age and sex, monthly 
frequency of attacks, headache duration in hours, monthly 
days of taking abortive medication use, and the severity of 
pain [assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging 
from 0 to 10] were collected and assessed. The applied ques-
tionnaires included Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6) to mea-
sure headache-related impact, Patient Health Questionnare-9 
(PHQ-9) to assess depression, Generalized Anxiety Disor-
der-7 (GAD-7) to assess anxiety, and the Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index (PSQI) to measure the quality of sleep.21-24 
Climate factors
Detailed climate data for the catchment area of our study 
population were acquired from the Korea Meteorological 
Administration (www.kma.go.kr). In brief, monthly temper-
atures were defined as the air temperatures at 1.5 m above 
ground level in Korea. The monthly relative humidity refers to 
the ratio of the amount of water vapor in the air to the amount 
of water vapor at saturation at that temperature during the 
corresponding month. Precipitation was defined by the depth 
of water in the measuring equipment installed at the Korea 
Meteorological Administration. Total sunshine hours refer to 
sunlight shining on the ground without being obscured by 
clouds or fog.
Measurement and analysis of vitamin D 
The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration 
is used to assess the vitamin D status. Nonfasting levels of se-
rum 25(OH)D were measured using a chemiluminescence 
immunoassay (ARCHITECT i4000SR, Abbott Diagnostics, 
Abbott Park, IL, USA). The intra- and interassay coefficients of 
variation were 1.7–2.8% and 2.7–4.1%, respectively. The assay 
was standardized against NIST Standard Reference Material 
2972 (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and certified by the 
Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention Vitamin D 
Standardization Program.25 Vitamin D deficiency, insufficien-
cy, and sufficiency were defined as <20, ≥20 and <30, and 
≥30 ng/mL 25(OH)D, respectively.6,26 The month and year 
were recorded for when the vitamin D test was performed.
Statistical analysis
A descriptive analysis of vitamin D deficiency and insufficien-
cy was carried out in absolute terms and according to season. 
The independent-samples t test was applied to continuous 
variables, and the chi-square test was used for categorical vari-
ables. The association of vitamin D deficiency with monthly 
headache frequency was analyzed using Poisson regression 
analysis after adjusting for demographics, migraine subtype, 
depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. A p value of <0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed

RESULTS
Patients and clinical demographics
There were 494 adult patients with migraine who were regis-
tered in the headache records between January 2016 to May 
2017, of which 154 had an incomplete response or absent 
questionnaire, 162 had no assessment of the vitamin D level, 
and 21 had an interval between the assessment and vitamin 
D testing of longer than 1 month, and so were excluded, re-
sulting in 157 migraineurs being included in this study (Fig. 
1). The sex distribution, number of days of migraine attacks 
per month, VAS score, and season distribution did not dif-
fer between the included and excluded patients, but the fre-
quency of chronic migraine was higher and that of probable 
migraine was lower in the included patients (Supplementary 
Table 1 in the online-only Data Supplement).
The 157 included patients were aged 37.0±8.6 years (mean± 
standard deviation), and 75.2% (118/157) of them were fe-
male. They were classified into migraine without aura (n=114), 
migraine with aura (n=8), chronic migraine (n=31), and 
probable migraine (n=4) according to the ICHD-3 classifica-
tion. The vitamin D level was 15.9±7.4 ng/mL. The frequency 
of vitamin D deficiency was observed in 121 migraineurs 
(77.0%), and was more common in spring and winter than in 
summer and autumn (89.1%, 85.7%, 72.4%, and 61.7%, re-
spectively; p=0.008). Based on a <30 ng/mL cutoff for serum 
vitamin D, 149 (94.9%) migraineurs were considered to have 
vitamin D insufficiency.
Comparison of demographics and clinical factors 
according to presence of vitamin D deficiency
The demographics, headache characteristics, and accompa-
nying problems (HIT-6 score, PHQ-9 score, GAD-7 score, 
and PSQI) did not differ significantly between migraineurs 
with and without vitamin D deficiency, with the exception 
of the seasonal distribution. The number of monthly days 
with headache tended to be higher in patients with vitamin 
D deficiency than in those without deficiency (p=0.073) (Ta-
ble 1). The temperature, relative humidity, and total sun-
shine hours of the months in which the vitamin D concen-
tration was measured were lower in those with vitamin D 
deficiency than in those without deficiency (Table 1). When 
dichotomizing seasons into summer/autumn and winter/
spring, the serum vitamin D level was negatively correlated 
with the HIT-6 score in summer/autumn (ρ=–0.239, p=0.037) 
but not in winter/spring (ρ=0.094, p=0.405). 
Factors associated with monthly headache frequency
In multivariate Poisson regression analysis, monthly head-
ache was 1.203 times [95% confidence interval (CI)=1.046–
1.383, p=0.009] more frequent in patients with vitamin D 
deficiency than in those without deficiency after adjusting 
for age, sex, and variables with p<0.1 in the univariate analy-
sis [season (winter/spring vs. summer/autumn), migraine 
subtype (chronic vs. episodic), depression (PHQ-9 score), 
anxiety (GAD-7 score), and sleep quality (PSQI)]. Chronic 
migraine was more strongly associated than episodic migraine 
with the number of monthly days with headache [odds ratio 
(OR)=2.562, 95% CI=2.292–2.864, p<0.001] (Table 2).
Comparison of demographics and clinical data 
according to sex and chronicity
Vitamin D deficiency was observed more frequently in fe-
males (79.7%) than in males (69.2%), although the difference 
was not statistically significant (p=0.179). In subgroup anal-
ysis, males with vitamin D deficiency tended to have higher 
VAS and PSQI scores than those without deficiency (Table 
3). In subgroup multivariate analysis after adjusting for age, 
season (winter/spring vs. summer/autumn), and migraine 
subtype (chronic vs. episodic), vitamin D deficiency was in-
dependently associated with more monthly days with head-
ache in females (OR=1.220, 95% CI=1.026–1.451, p=0.024) 
but not in males (OR=1.123, 95% CI=0.866–1.456, p=0.383).
In chronic migraine patients, the number of monthly days 
with headache was higher in migraineurs with vitamin D de-
ficiency than in those without deficiency (19.3±7.0 days vs.

13.3±4.0 days, p=0.058). None of the other variables differed 
significantly with vitamin D deficiency in either episodic mi-
graineurs or chronic migraineurs (Table 4). In subgroup 
multivariate analysis after adjusting for age, sex, and season 
(winter/spring vs. summer/autumn), vitamin D deficiency was 
independently associated with more monthly days with head-
ache in both episodic migraine patients (OR=1.266, 95% CI= 
1.019–1.573, p=0.033) and chronic migraine patients (OR= 
1.390, 95% CI= 1.013–1.905, p=0.041).
DISCUSSION
We found that proportion of migraineurs with vitamin D 
deficiency varied from 61.7% in autumn to 89.1% in spring. 
Vitamin D deficiency was independently associated with an 
increased frequency of monthly headache among migraineu-
rs even after adjusting for season, depression, anxiety, and sleep

quality. 
The reported prevalence rates of vitamin D insufficiency and 
deficiency in patients with migraine have varied from 40% to 
68% and from 13% to 80%, respectively.16,17,19,27,28 These dif-
ferences are presumably due to differences in race, research 
design, and residence area.15 The incidence rates of vitamin 
D deficiency or insufficiency in our study were similar to 
previous data from Korea, with the prevalence of vitamin D 
deficiency reportedly being 68.5% in males and 83.1% in fe-
males.29 Although previous studies have found vitamin D 
deficiency to be more common in nonmigraine headaches or 
chronic tension-type headaches, the relative prevalence rates 
of vitamin deficiency in migraineurs versus nonheadache 
controls have not been established.19,30 
Our study found that the number of monthly days with 
headache was associated with serum vitamin D deficiency. 
Despite of the limitation of small samples in the subgroup 
analysis, this association was consistently noted among fe-
males, episodic migraine patients, and chronic migraine 
patients. Previous studies found that the frequency of head-
ache attack tended to increase in winter and decrease in 
summer, which is consistent with the seasonal variation of

serum vitamin D levels.15 Combination therapy with simv-
astatin and vitamin D was found to exert migraine-preven-
tive effects in a previous randomized clinical trial,10 but vita-
min D had been prescribed for its anti-inflammatory effect 
against cytokines or the alleviation of muscle pain.11 Further-
more, there are few reports on the association of vitamin D 
and headache frequency in females and chronic migraine 
patients, and so our study provides new information on this 
research topic. 
The severity of migraine was found to not be related to vi-
tamin D level among migraineurs in middle East Asian coun-
tries.16 Studies have also shown no significant relationship 
between serum vitamin D and migraine severity.17 Our re-
sults are in line with these previous findings because the VAS 
scores did not differ with vitamin D deficiency. However, 
considering the effect of season, our study demonstrated that 
the HIT-6 score was negatively correlated with vitamin D lev-
el during summer/autumn only. It is possible that the effect 
of HIT-6 was not clear due to low individual differences in 
normal vitamin D concentrations during spring and winter.
The mechanisms underlying the associations of migraine 
and migraine frequency with vitamin D remain to be eluci-
dated. However, a few hypotheses are as follows: First, the 
vitamin D receptors 1-hydroxylase (the enzyme responsible 
for the formation of the active form of vitamin D) and vita-
min-D-binding protein are located in the brain. Vitamin D 
facilitates the differentiation of brain cells, regulates axonal 
growth, and regulates calcium signaling directly in the brain, 
modulates the production of brain-derived reactive oxygen 
species, and stimulates the production of neurotrophic fac-
tors. These roles of vitamin D elicit peripheral and central 
sensitization of neurons in the periosteum during bone swell-
ing, resulting in headache.7,17 Second, although this was not 
evaluated in our study, magnesium is the second-most-plen-
tiful intracellular cation and an important component of bone 
mineralization that plays a crucial role in the synthesis and 
metabolism of vitamin D. Lower levels of vitamin D are gen-
erally associated with lower serum magnesium levels.31 A

Vitamin D Deficiency in Migraine
JCN
previous study found that the serum levels of magnesium 
were lower during migraine attacks than in healthy individ-
uals.32 Third, neurological diseases such as depression and 
fibromyalgia, which are associated with vitamin D, are also 
closely related to migraine itself. It is therefore possible that 
our findings are attributed to accompanying health condi-
tions.7,33 
Our study had several limitations. First, a retrospective 
analysis was performed based on headache clinic data and 
a relatively small sample. Moreover, although the clinical 
features were similar in the included and excluded patients, 
the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in this study was lim-
ited to the entire population because of differences in the 
rates of chronic migraine. However, the purpose of this study 
was to determine the relationship between vitamin D defi-
ciency and headache variables. Furthermore, the relationship 
between vitamin D deficiency and monthly days with head-
ache was statistically significant in both episodic and chron-
ic migraineurs. Second, the number of monthly days with 
headache was based on recall rather than being assessed us-
ing a headache diary. Third, vitamin D replacement by diet, 
medication, or fortification was not assessed.
Notwithstanding these limitations, our study has the fol-
lowing strengths. First, it was conducted in Asia at relatively 
high latitudes without prominent sun-seeking behaviors. The 
geographic and cultural characteristics provide novel in-
sights into the association of vitamin D with migraine in an 
area with a high risk of vitamin D deficiency. Second, our study 
systematically considered depression, anxiety, and sleep qual-
ity, which are closely related to the characteristics of migraine. 
Third, our study made adjustments for seasonal variation 
and climate factors that influence serum vitamin D levels.
In conclusion, our study found that a larger number of 
monthly days with headache is related to vitamin D deficien-
cy among migraineurs. The vitamin D level may also be asso-
ciated with the occurrence or impact of headache among mi-
graineurs. Future studies should attempt to confirm the causal 
relationship between vitamin D deficiency and migraine.
