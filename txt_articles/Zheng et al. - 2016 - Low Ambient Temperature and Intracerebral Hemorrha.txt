Abstract
Background
Rates of acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) increase in winter months but the magnitude
of risk is unknown. We aimed to quantify the association of ambient temperature with the
risk of ICH in the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage Trial
(INTERACT2) participants on an hourly timescale.
Methods
INTERACT2 was an international, open, blinded endpoint, randomized controlled trial of
patients with spontaneous ICH (<6h of onset) and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP,
150–220 mmHg) assigned to intensive (target SBP <140 mmHg) or guideline-recommended
(SBP <180 mmHg) BP treatment. We linked individual level hourly temperature to baseline
data of 1997 participants, and performed case-crossover analyses using a distributed lag
non-linear model with 24h lag period to assess the association of ambient temperature and
risk of ICH. Results were presented as overall cumulative odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI.
Results
Low ambient temperature (�10°C) was associated with increased risks of ICH: overall
cumulative OR was 1.37 (0.99–1.91) for 10°C, 1.92 (1.31–2.81) for 0°C, 3.13 (1.89–5.19)
for -10°C, and 5.76 (2.30–14.42) for -20°C, as compared with a reference temperature of

Introduction
Acute stroke due to spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a major
global health issue which causes death and permanent disability in several million people
worldwide each year [1]. While marked seasonal and temporal patterns to the occurrence of
ICH are recognised, with peak incidence in the winter and an association with cold tempera-
ture [2–5], this information is primarily derived from daily meteorological data without con-
sideration of ambient temperature close to the time of onset of ICH. Moreover, the time lag
method, which has shown an association of ambient temperature with acute myocardial infarc-
tion [6,7], has not been used in the study of ICH where influences on fluctuations in blood
pressure (BP) appear especially important [8]. Thus, the association of ambient temperature
with ICH onset has not been well quantified on an hourly time-scale. Such information could
help our understanding of the determinants of ICH in high risk populations that have marked
seasonal and geographical trends in rates [9], and guide public health strategies to optimize
preventative strategies in winter.
The primary aim of this study was to quantify the transient increase in risk of ICH associ-
ated with declining ambient temperature at an hourly resolution. Secondary aims were to
determine the time sequence of low temperature triggering effects on ICH occurrence and
whether there is any variation in risks across several pre-defined patient characteristics.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
The INTERACT 2 study protocol was approved by the ethics committees for each centers and
written informed consent was obtained from all patients or relevant surrogates. A full list of
centers that participated in the trial is shown in Acknowledgments. Patient records/informa-
tion was anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis.
Study Design
We conducted post-hoc analysis using the baseline patient data from the second (main phase)
Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Haemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2). The
design and main results of INTERACT2 have been described elsewhere.[10,11]. In brief,
INTERACT2 was an international, multicenter, open, blinded endpoint, randomized con-
trolled trial [12]. A total of 2839 patients with CT-confirmed spontaneous ICH, elevated sys-
tolic BP (SBP, 150-220mmHg), and capacity to commence BP lowering treatment (<6h of
onset assessed by ‘time last seen normal’), were enrolled from 144 hospitals in 21 countries
between 7th October 2008 and 30th August 2012. Patients were excluded if they had a struc-
tural cerebral cause for the ICH, deep coma (defined as a score of 3–5 on the Glasgow coma

 scale [GCS] [13], where scores range from 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating reduced levels
of consciousness), massive hematoma with a poor prognosis, or if early surgery to evacuate the
hematoma was planned. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive intensive (target
SBP <140mmHg within 1h) or guideline recommended (SBP <180mmHg) BP treatment. In
order to minimize assessor bias, the primary outcome of ‘death or major disability’ (as mea-
sured by the modified Rankin scale) at 90 days was evaluated by clinicians who were blind to
the randomized treatment. The date of the final patient follow up was 31 December 2012.
We obtained hourly ambient temperature data primarily from Weatherbank Inc (Edmond,
US) which directly sources weather observations from worldwide government agencies that
represent the official source of data in different countries. Data from the Australian Bureau of
Meteorology was also used. For the main analyses, we linked baseline data of 1997 individual
patients (70%) to hourly temperature data from monitoring stations less than 100km from the
patients’ hospital of enrolment.
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics of the included patients were compared to those excluded in models
using chi-square or Wilcoxon rank sum tests. We applied a time-stratified, case-crossover anal-
ysis to the data with the preceding 24h period of the reported ICH onset time selected as the
case period for each ICH event [14–16]. Control periods of exposure were defined as the com-
parable 24h before the ICH in the other weeks of the same month and year. This method of
selecting control periods has been shown to effectively control for time invariant confounders
and seasonality, whilst also avoiding the problems of time trend and overlap bias associated
with other methods of referent selection [16,17]. Thus, each participant was represented with a
matched set of data for 1 case period and 3–4 control periods.
We assessed the risk of ICH in a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) which was origi-
nally developed to estimate the non-linear and delayed effects of temperature (or air pollution)
on mortality or morbidity [18,19]. We applied recent developments in the method that
extended DLNMs beyond time series data, and made it applicable in a case-crossover study
design [20]. The DLNM involves a bi-dimensional space of functions that describes simulta-
neously the shape of the relationship along both the space of the predictor and the lag dimen-
sion of its occurrence. We modeled the exposure-response function with a natural cubic spline
with internal knots placed at quartiles of ambient temperature and a reference temperature of
20°C (taken as the average optimal temperature of comfort for humans) [21], and the lag-
response function was modeled with a natural cubic spline with two equally spaced internal
knots in log-scale. A bi-dimensional plot was constructed to demonstrate the entire relation-
ship between temperature and ICH risk whilst also taking into account the time sequence of
effect. Lag-response curves were plotted to describe the evolving temporal change in ICH risk
in a 24 h lag period after exposure to specific temperatures in comparison to a reference opti-
mal temperature of 20°C. Furthermore, the effect of temperature was summarized in an overall
cumulative exposure-response figure which shows the net increased ICH risk over an entire lag
period of 24 h in association with temperature exposure, accounting for any harvesting or
lagged effects. Finally, our results were also presented as overall cumulative odds ratios (ORs)
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) that were computed by summation of the lag-specific risk
contributions for a given pattern of temperature exposures during the 24 hours lag period. The
statistical equation describing the DLNM model and derivation of the overall cumulative odds
ratio is outlined elsewhere [20].
In order to check the robustness of the study results, several sensitivity analyses were per-
formed; by inclusion of all patients with known hourly temperature data within 200km of the

24 to 72 h. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R
project for statistical computing V.3.1.0 using the ‘dlnm’ and ‘survival’ packages.
Results
Table 1 shows the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with available
ambient temperature data (‘included patients’, n = 1997) and those without such data
(‘excluded patients’, n = 832). Those without this data were significantly younger, had less
prior use of antithrombotic therapy, higher diastolic BP, and more likely to have lobar ICH
and larger hematoma volumes. The weather parameters of the 79 cities included in analyses
are outlined in the S1 Table.
Fig 1 shows the bi-dimensional exposure-lag-response surface, depicting changes across
temperature and lags with a trend of higher ORs at low ambient temperatures and shorter time
lags. The lag-exposure plots in Fig 2 indicates an elevated risk of ICH in association with

 exposure to low ambient temperature (�10°C) between lag 0 to lag 3 and that a harvesting
effect seems to exist at longer lags. The main results of our study are shown in Fig 3, which
reflects the relationship between low temperature exposure and ICH risk. A total number of
1568 (79%) ICH cases occurred below the optimal reference temperature. The overall cumula-
tive ORs for ICH progressively increased from 1.37 (0.99–1.91) for 10°C, 1.92 (1.31–2.81) for
0°C, 3.13 (1.89–5.19) for -10°C, and 5.76 (2.30–14.42) for -20°C.
Fig 4 shows a temporal pattern to the occurrence of ICH, with peak frequencies in the early
morning (06:00–10:00) and evening (20:00–23:00), but no clear relationship with the level of
SBP among patients at the time of entry into the trial.
Results of sensitivity analyses including all patients with known hourly temperature data
within 200km of the site of enrolment and extending the maximum lag length from 24 to 72h
all produced similar results (S1–S3 Figs).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale international study to have investigated the asso-
ciation between ambient temperature and ICH risk at an hourly resolution and to capture the
time sequence of the detrimental effect of low ambient temperature. Using distributed lag non-
linear model fitted to a case-crossover model involving 1997 well-characterized ICH patients,
we found a clear association of low ambient temperature with ICH occurrence within a few
hours of exposure.

response function was modeled with a natural cubic spline with internal knots placed at quartiles of ambient

natural cubic spline with two equally spaced internal knots in log-scale.

 Several but not all studies have reported an association between low ambient temperature
and ICH [2–5,22–24]. This discrepancy may be due to the use of daily temperature parameters
that may not be truly representative of the temperature at the time of ICH onset. Furthermore,
previous studies involved subjects from single regions, some of which have relatively small vari-
ations in temperature throughout the year. Our study using hourly temperature data in a large
international study population corroborates the findings of a Taiwanese study with known
hourly temperature data at ICH onset which showed a trend of increased ICH occurrence
towards the lower temperature and is also consistent with prior investigations and clinical
observation of a peak ICH occurrence in the winter due in part to the trigger effect of low ambi-
ent temperature on the risk of ICH onset at particular times of the day [2–5,25]. Mechanisms
underlying the increased ICH risk in colder climate have not been resolved but exposure to low
temperatures has been shown to stress the sympathetic nervous system leading to acute
increases in heart rate, peripheral resistance, and thereby BP [26,27]. Although acute increases
in BP associated with exposure to low ambient temperature is the most plausible trigger of
ICH, we were unable to find any correlation between admission SBP level and ambient temper-
ature, nor any differences in risks between those with and without a history of hypertension.
This could be because the admission systolic BP of participants may not be representative of
their BP level close to the time of ICH onset, or that ICH patients with non-elevated BP were
excluded from our study.

 Previous studies have reported upon a temperature effect for up to 14 days for the occur-
rence of myocardial infarction [6,7]. However, our study results show no association of low
temperature beyond several hours prior to ICH onset and this finding is further supported by
sensitivity analysis with extended lag period of 72 h. The differences in these risk time periods
may be attributable to the distinctions in pathological mechanisms of onset for myocardial
infarction (being plaque rupture from atherothrombosis) and ICH (being mainly due to the
rupture of small deep perforating intracerebral vessels).
Key strengths of this study include the large sample of a wide range of patients with early
and rigorous standardised evaluations of clinical and imaging findings after acute ICH. Also
we were able to attain reliable hourly temperature weather data and link this information to the
baseline patient characteristics to conduct precise evaluations on the effects of low ambient
temperature. Our case-crossover model with control periods stratified by calendar month
inherently adjusted for potential confounders, such as slow time varying individual characteris-
tics, time of the day, day of the week, and seasonality. Furthermore, we were also able to avoid
problems of time trend and overlap bias associated with other methods of control selection
[16,17].

 There are several limitations to our study. First, the study population is subject to varying
levels of selection bias that may limit the generalizability of the results. Being a clinical trial
population, patients with a poor prognosis due to massive hematoma or deep coma, and in
whom early surgery was planned, were excluded. Therefore, future studies on a general ICH
population are necessary to validate our findings. Another issue is that we were unable to
obtain (�100km) hourly temperature data for 30% of participants (‘excluded patients’), of
which the majority were from second to third tier cities in China (Baotou, Xuzhou, Wenzhou
and Xining). Differences in the provision of healthcare and medical development, and diet and
lifestyles, may have resulted in significant differences in characteristics such as ‘time from
onset to randomization’ and use of medications (e.g. antihypertensives and antithrombotics)
and contribute to variability in severity of hospital presentation and prognosis, thus limiting
the generalizability of our findings. However, sensitivity analyses that included approximated
temperature of Baotou (83%) showed a slight increase in ICH risk in association with low tem-
perature in comparison to the primary analyses. A further issue relates to the precision of the
exposure temperature data, as some of our weather data for the main analyses originated from
monitoring stations up to 100 kilometres away from participating hospitals. However, this may
likely have generated a non-differential misclassification that biased the result toward the null,
and therefore produced conservative estimates of the true risk. We were also unable to account
for potential confounding from individual changes in behaviour and cold protection. We may
have been able to partly mitigate this problem through use of the case-crossover design and
control selection strategy as the pattern of activity and clothing habits of individuals are likely

 to remain consistent at across times of the day, days of the week, and within a one-month cal-
endar period. It is also interesting to note that a Eurowinter group study reported no associa-
tions between indoor heating, clothing protection, and even sweating, with reductions in
cerebrovascular disease related mortality [28]. While we were unable to collect information on
other potential confounders, such as the patients’ emotional state that could have a bearing on
BP variability, the presence of viral infections, usage of sympathomimetics and of other
weather parameters or air pollution, these are also assumed to be constant in case-crossover
analysis. Finally, as the study was post-hoc, we cannot exclude the play of chance and reliably
establish a causal relationship between low ambient temperature and ICH occurrence.
In conclusion, the present findings based on 1997 patients from a large global study show
an increased risk of ICH within a few hours of exposure to very low ambient temperature. The
risk of ICH in high-risk subjects might be reduced by more stringent monitoring and manage-
ment of BP levels during cold seasons, targeted personal advice and environmental heating
interventions, triggered by forecasts of very low temperature.
