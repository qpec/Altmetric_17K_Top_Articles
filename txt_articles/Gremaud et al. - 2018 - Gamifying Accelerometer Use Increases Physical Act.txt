Background-—Sedentary work is hazardous. Over 80% of all US jobs are predominantly sedentary, placing full-time office workers
at increased risk for cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity and mortality. Thus, there is a critical need for effective workplace
physical activity interventions. MapTrek is a mobile health platform that gamifies Fitbit use for the purpose of promoting physical
activity. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of MapTrek for increasing daily steps and moderate-intensity steps over
10 weeks in a sample of sedentary office workers.
Methods and Results-—Participants included 146 full-time sedentary office workers aged 21 to 65 who reported sitting at least
75% of their workday. Each participant received a Fitbit Zip to wear daily throughout the intervention. Participants were randomized
to either a: (1) Fitbit-only group or 2) Fitbit + MapTrek group. Physical activity outcomes and intervention compliance were
measured with the Fitbit activity monitor. The Fitbit + MapTrek group significantly increased daily steps (+2092 steps per day) and
active minutes (+11.2 min/day) compared to the Fitbit-only arm, but, on average, participants’ steps declined during the study
period.
Conclusions-—MapTrek is an effective approach for increasing physical activity at a clinically meaningful level in sedentary office
workers, but as with accelerometer use alone, the effect decreases over time.

articipating in regular physical activity is effective for the
primary and secondary prevention of several chronic
diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus,
cancer, obesity, hypertension, osteoporosis, and depression.1
The Federal Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans
recommend that healthy adults engage in 150 minutes of
moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity each week to
achieve health benefit.2 Unfortunately, studies using objective
measures of physical activity (accelerometers) suggest that
<25% of US adults are achieving 30 minutes of moderate- to
vigorous-intensity physical activity per day.3,4 Such low levels
of physical activity represent a significant public health
problem as recent estimates suggest that 9% of all deaths
worldwide are directly caused by physical inactivity.5
Total physical activity levels have declined among US
adults over the past 50 years, and declines in work-related
physical activity are a major contributor.6 The work environ-
ment has become increasingly sedentary with the rise of
labor-saving technologies such as the desktop computer.
Sedentary jobs have increased 83% since 1950; furthermore,
highly sedentary service jobs now account for 43% of all US
jobs.6 Employees working in office jobs spend more than 89%
of their time sitting, placing them at increased risk for
inactivity-related pathologies and in need of interventions
targeting hazardous sedentary work time.
In an effort to promote the health of employees, worksites
and researchers have traditionally developed programs that
encourage employees to exercise during times outside of their

 normal working hours. Such programs have suffered from
high dropout rates and have been largely unsuccessful for
promoting sustained behavior changes.7 These findings are
not surprising given that the most common self-reported
barriers to engaging in structured exercise include lack of
time, lack of motivation, inconvenience, and not finding
exercise to be enjoyable.8 Thus, there is a need for low-cost,
sustainable approaches that motivate sedentary working
adults to build regular physical activity into their usual
routine, both at work and outside the workplace.
The rise of inexpensive, wearable activity monitors and
mobile phone applications has now made it easy to both
monitor daily physical activity levels and intervene for the
purpose of increasing physical activity. There is evidence that
just wearing activity monitors has been associated with
significant increases in daily steps.9 However, recent research
suggests that both activity monitors and apps are typically
designed based on behavior change techniques (ie, self-
monitoring, goal setting, feedback) that are limited in their
ability to engage users and promote sustained increases in
physical activity.10 The development of mobile-based pro-
grams designed to encourage more walking is a worthwhile
pursuit given the demonstrated cardioprotective benefits of
regular walking.11 Walking is a familiar activity most able-
bodied adults can complete throughout the day and is the
most commonly reported type of physical activity among
adults.12
In recent years, games have been used in a variety of
settings to motivate and change health behaviors. Games not
only provide performance feedback to the user but can also
provide incentives for achieving goals in a context that is fun,
intrinsically rewarding, and easy to understand. “Exergames,”
or active video games that require physical movement while
playing, have been shown to result in significant increases in
energy expenditure.13 However, many exergames require
expensive equipment and must be played inside the home,
limiting their use in real-world settings. Recent games have
been developed that exploit motivating social factors (eg,
social interactions, social comparison, peer support, compe-
tition) and have potential for promoting physical activity in
real-world settings such as the worksite.14 Social interaction
features have been identified as a key influence of players’
initial and sustained interest in games15 and as a mediator for
behavior change.16 Moreover, multiplayer games generally
lead to greater energy expenditure than solo games, and even
“virtual friends” (ie, competing against strangers) can lead to
increased fitness.17
To specifically address the most commonly reported
barriers to engaging in regular physical activity (time and
motivation), our interdisciplinary research group created
MapTrek, a low-cost mobile phone–based walking game for
the purpose of promoting physical activity in a fun and
interactive format. MapTrek leverages and gamifies a widely
used physical activity monitor (Fitbit) to both track users’
physical activity and motivate users to be more active on a
daily basis. MapTrek places users in a series of virtual walking
races that take place in any number of interesting locations
around the world. MapTrek also sends users automated game
messages via text message that are based on the user’s Fitbit-
recorded activity.
Our overall objective was to develop a mobile game that
encourages sedentary workers to walk more throughout the
day and to maintain that behavior change over time. The
purpose of the present study was to test the efficacy of
MapTrek for increasing daily physical activity levels compared
to a control group in a sample of sedentary office workers. We
hypothesized that the MapTrek group would increase both
daily steps and the total number of active minutes (minutes
with 100+ steps) compared to a non-MapTrek control group.
Methods
Subjects and Design
We recruited healthy adults who reported working full-time in
a primarily sedentary job. Participants were recruited via an e-
mail advertisement sent to all employees of a large university.
The advertisement included a link to an online eligibility
survey. Exclusion criteria included (1) age <18 or >65 years,
(2) pregnancy or planned pregnancy, (3) not owning a
smartphone, (4) not fluent in English, (5) any reported
contraindications to engaging in physical activity, (6) not
working full-time (minimum of 35 hours per week), and (7) not
working in a sedentary job (reporting sitting ≥75% of
workday). Research staff contacted interested and eligible

sedentary office workers over a wearable activity monitor

What Are the Clinical Implications?
• These findings suggest that wearable activity monitors alone
may not be sufficient to increase physical activity levels of
sedentary adults.
• Combining wearables with theory-based mHealth technolo-
gies may be effective at increasing physical activity levels,
but additional research is needed to determine whether
such approaches can instill long-term behavior changes.

 employees to schedule a baseline visit. Experimental proto-
cols were approved by the Human Subjects Office Institutional
Review Board, and voluntary written informed consent was
obtained from each participant. The data that support the
findings of this study are available from the corresponding
author upon reasonable request.
The sample size was based on a meta-analysis of previous
pedometer-based studies,18 which found a standard deviation
of about 2000 steps per day between the average steps taken
by subjects. We assumed that the within-subject interday
standard deviation would be similar, at 2000 steps per day.
We assumed that within a subject, days are independent and
identically distributed. In other words, the steps taken on
1 day have no impact on the steps taken on the following day
and the distribution from day-to-day does not change. We
used these assumptions to produce simulated data to
conduct a power analysis. We sought to have 80% power to
detect a difference between the groups of 1250 steps/day
with an a of 0.05 (minimum detectable M0=1250). We
selected the 1250 steps per day threshold as a conservative
estimate based on previous research that found adding 1385
steps per day resulted in significant reductions in multiple
cardiometabolic risk factors.19 Based on previous interven-
tions, however, it seems plausible that the effect of an
intervention like MapTrek will be closer to 1250 steps per
day.20 For M0=1250, a sample size of 60 per group would
have an estimated power of 0.831 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.817–0.845). To account for the potential for dropouts,
we increased our sample by 25% to 75 per arm.
A total of 784 people completed the screening survey, of
which 653 were identified as eligible (Figure 1). Interested
participants were contacted in the order they completed the
eligibility survey and asked to attend a face-to-face baseline
orientation visit. A total of 146 participants were found
eligible. All baseline visits were conducted in September
2016. Participants were consented immediately upon arrival
for their baseline visit and were provided a Fitbit Zip activity
monitor to wear on the hip. Participants were then random-
ized (1:1 ratio) to 1 of 2 groups: (1) Fitbit-only group (FB) or
(2) Fitbit + MapTrek (MT) group. The investigators used
sequentially numbered envelopes to implement the random
allocation sequence. Two research assistants who enrolled all
participants asked participants to select 1 of 2 sealed
envelopes, giving them an equal chance (50%) of being
selected for the intervention or control group. Following
randomization, group responsibilities were explained.
Fitbit-Only Group
Participants randomized to the FB group were provided a
Fitbit Zip activity monitor and were instructed on how to wear
the monitor and how to pair and sync the activity monitor to
their smartphone. Participants were free to access the Fitbit
app at any time throughout the study but did not receive any
reminders to do so from the research team. Participants also
provided us their cell phone number and access to their Fitbit
account, which allowed us to track their daily physical activity
levels via our MapTrek research platform. Specifically, this
platform accesses Fitbit data through Fitbit’s application
programming interface, and the data are then made available
to our team on a minute-by-minute frequency. For this study,
the research platform was used to analyze each user’s Fitbit
data and send participants text message reminders to wear
their Fitbit on days following nonwear days (eg, “You didn’t
record any steps yesterday. Please remember to wear your
Fitbit today.”) The reminder system was used to help ensure
that both groups wore their monitors equally throughout the
study.
Fitbit + MapTrek Group
Participants randomized to the MapTrek arm received the
same Fitbit Zip and assistance setting up their Fitbit account
as the FB group. MT participants were also provided access to
the full MapTrek mobile health (mHealth) game. The MapTrek
participant interface is a platform-independent web app (no
special installation needed). MapTrek automatically sends and
receives bidirectional text messages to participants via a
commercial web-to-short message service gateway (http://
www.twilio.com/). As part of the game, users are entered into
weekly virtual walking races (Sunday through Saturday), which
follow a predetermined route that is displayed on Google
Maps. At the beginning of each week, users received a
message that a new race was about to start. Because the
game leverages Google Maps, participants are able to see
where they are on the route in real time via the Google Street
View feature. Each participant is represented in the game by a
stick figure on the map that advances along the weekly race
route based on data obtained via the participant’s Fitbit.
Therefore, the more active the participant is in real life, the
faster they move along the virtual race. The participant’s
position is automatically updated each time their Fitbit syncs
to their phone or personal computer.
Each week, MT participants were placed into 1 of 6
leagues (�10 people per league), which were determined
based on each individual’s average daily steps during the
previous week. Participants were divided into sextiles to
determine each individual’s weekly league placement. The
purpose of the activity-based leagues was to maintain strong
competition among similarly active participants and minimize
discouragement.21
The
competition-based
leagues
were
grounded in the cognitive evaluation theory, which states
that intrinsic motivation is based on an individual’s need for
competence, achievement, and self-determination.22 The

 theory also suggests that informational aspects of external
events (eg, winning a race or losing a race) can both
enhance (when positive) or diminish (when negative) the
individual’s intrinsic motivation.23 Competitiveness has also
been positively associated with regular exercise.24 Therefore,
individuals were place into activity-based leagues to give
each participant an equal chance of winning the weekly race,
which could subsequently boost the individuals’ sense of
achievement. We also hypothesized that narrowly losing a
theoretically winnable race (ie, competence) might also
result in increased effort from that individual during the next
weekly race. To minimize any instance of discouragement
from being placed in a less active league, participants were
not informed of their league placement. Rather, participants
were able to view only the step achievements of those
participants placed into their weekly league. Each week,
leagues were entered into a virtual race in a specific location
in the world (eg, Appalachian Trail). The game collected real-
time step counts via Fitbit and used those data to move the
user’s avatar along the race path. At any point, each
participant could view his or her real-time location on the
game leaderboard and route map as well as on Google
Street View (Figure 2). The game also displayed each user’s
average number of steps taken per day, position or “place”
on the trail, bonus steps achieved, and total steps accumu-
lated each week. This constant display was developed to
promote self-monitoring of physical activity behavior, which
is a construct of the social cognitive theory and has been
shown to be an important predictor of physical activity
adoption.25
Each morning, participants received a text message
tailored to the individual’s activity level and progress along
the route. The daily messages informed the user of his or her
place in the game, average daily steps, and a daily activity
challenge (if implemented). The daily challenge messages
were designed to add a fun and motivational aspect to the
game, offering bonus steps if the participant chose to accept
and met the challenge. Step challenges were determined by
the user’s typical daily physical activity behaviors. Typically, a
20% increase in steps was implemented with a minimum of

 1500 steps. For example, if a participant averaged around
8000 steps per day the previous week, the daily challenge on
Monday may have been to take 9600 steps. If the participant
met the goal, they were rewarded with a predetermined
number of bonus steps (+500 steps). However, if the
participant did not meet the goal, the participant had that
same amount deducted from his or her daily steps (�500
steps). This game feature was implemented based on risk-
taking theory, which suggests that people are more likely to
engage in a challenge if they believe they have a realistic
chance of receiving a payoff.26,27 The individual could also
choose not to accept the challenge.
Participants were also able to view and track their virtual
progress along the route via Google Maps and the daily link
sent via text, which is also consistent with the theoretical
construct of self-monitoring.28 Upon syncing the Fitbit to their
smartphone and refreshing the MapTrek screen, participants
could view their own personal updated data and progress.
Participants’ raw daily step counts (sans bonus steps) were
also viewable in real time by the research team via the Fitbit
application programming interface.
Measures
The primary outcomes for the study were average daily steps
and active minutes (minutes with ≥100 steps per minute
recorded) as measured objectively for 7 consecutive days by
the Fitbit Zip activity monitor. The Fitbit Zip is a small
(35.6928.999.6 mm) triaxial accelerometer-based activity
monitor that estimates daily steps taken at the minute-to-
minute level. A single replaceable battery provides 4 to
6 months of use. The Fitbit Zip has been demonstrated as a
valid measure of daily steps when compared to the Actigraph
GT3X+ (r=0.99; intraclass correlation=0.98) in free living
conditions.29 Through the Fitbit application programming
interface and our custom-built texting platform, our team was
able to access each user’s physical activity data on a minute-
by-minute frequency each day they wore the monitor for the
entire 10-week intervention. Participants were instructed to
wear the monitor during all waking hours (except time spent
bathing or swimming) for 10 consecutive weeks. Participants’
activity monitor wear time (total daily minutes with at least 1
step recorded), steps, and active minutes were collected daily

 over the duration of the 10-week intervention. Only days that
had at least 1 step recorded were included in the final
analysis. Additionally, only raw steps (no bonus steps) were
included in the final analysis.
At baseline, each participant’s height and weight were
measured. Height was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm using
a professional-grade height rod (Seca 769, Hanover, MD).
Weight, fat mass, and lean mass were measured to the
nearest 0.1 kg using a multifrequency bioelectrical impe-
dance analyzer (InBody 720, BioSpace Inc, Cerritos, CA),
which has demonstrated excellent reliability (coefficient of
variation=1.8%)30 and strong criterion validity when compared
to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry among obese adults
(intraclass correlation=0.83 for fat mass; intraclass correla-
tion=0.90 for fat-free mass)31 and healthy adults (r=0.80–
0.91 for body composition).30 Participants completed an
online questionnaire that assessed general demographics (eg,
age, sex, ethnicity, education, race, income, and marital
status), and occupation category; Table 1). All measures
collected at baseline were performed in a controlled labora-
tory by 1 of 2 staff members, who were blinded to
participants’ group assignment.
Following the 10-week intervention, MT participants were
asked to also complete an additional process-evaluation
survey that asked what (if anything) they most liked about the
game, what barriers (if any) prevented them from playing the
game, and what improvements (if any) they would recommend
for the game. Participants were asked to use a Likert scale
ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree to respond to
statements regarding whether (1) the game was fun; (2) the
game was easy to play; (3) the game motivated them to be
more active; (4) they were able to play the game in their spare
time; (5) they felt more supported to be physically active due
to playing the game; (6) they would like to have continued
access to the game; and (7) the game motivated them to keep
wearing their Fitbit.
Statistical Analysis
Because we have clustering within subject, we used mixed-
effect models for continuous outcomes. Mixed-effect models
are commonly used to analyze longitudinal outcomes.32
Specifically, mixed-effect models incorporate a random effect,
typically an intercept, for each subject. While there is a
population-level average intercept, the subject-specific devi-
ations from the population intercept follow a normal distribu-
tion with a mean of 0. The only parameter that needs to be
estimated in this context is the standard error for the
distribution that describes the random effects. A similar result
may be obtained using subject-level fixed effects to estimate
the subject-specific mean; however, that approach would
require estimation of (n-1) coefficients compared to the 1
coefficient required using random effects.
For our compliance outcome, because it is bounded by 0
and 1, we used generalized estimating equations with a
logistic link and an exchangeable correlation structure,
grouped by subject.
We modeled the 3 outcomes of interest (daily step counts,
daily number of active minutes, and compliance) in 3 ways: We
considered the outcomes during the entire baseline period, the
entire intervention period, and in a time-varying model.
In the baseline/intervention period models, we regressed
the outcome of interest on an indicator of group (MT versus
FB) and a random intercept by subject using only the data
from baseline or from the intervention periods. This is
analogous to performing a 2-sample t-test but accounts for
the between-subject differences and within-subject clustering.
The time-varying model allowed for different levels and
slopes for MT and FB during the baseline period and different
levels and slopes for MT and FB during the intervention period.
This was accomplished by the inclusion of the group member-
ship variable, relative days, an indicator for whether the
intervention is in effect, interactions among the group
membership and days, group membership and intervention
indicator and a 3-way interaction between group membership,
days and the intervention indicator. The resulting 8 effects
estimated by the model describe any differences between MT
and FB at baseline, the overall effect of the intervention, and
the differential effect of the intervention on the MT group and
the rates of decay of step counts for both MT and FB groups.
Differences and 95% CI between the intervention-phase
slopes (composite of several interaction terms) were calcu-
lated using the estimated coefficients for the fixed effects in
the full model and the variance-covariance matrix for the
relevant coefficients. We estimated 95% CI for the composite
coefficients by making 10 000 draws from a multivariate

Results
A total of 144 participants were randomized to 1 of 2 groups:
FB (N=72); or MT (N=72). Final analyses were completed on
all 144 participants. Baseline group characteristics are
presented in Table 1. Overall, participants were middle-aged,
mostly female, mostly white, and non-Hispanic. No significant
between-group differences were observed for baseline char-
acteristics (Table 1). Throughout the course of the study, a
total of 64 weekly MapTrek races took place, with the group
sizes ranging from 5 to 13 participants (mean=10.3, standard
deviation=1.3).
Average daily step counts and active minutes are shown by
group and days relative to the start of the intervention in
Figure 3. There is a sudden increase in the number of steps
taken among those in the MT group at the start of the
intervention.
After accounting for subject-specific differences in the
mixed-effect model, we found no difference between the
groups during the 1-week baseline in either daily total steps
(MT versus FB, +562; 95% CI, �358–1452) or daily active
minutes (MT versus FB, +1.1; 95% �4.1–6.1). However, after
the intervention started (relative days 0–62), there was a
difference between the groups. Relative to FB, MT players took
an average of 1455 (95% CI, 548–2361) more steps per day. FB
participants also completed an additional 5.5 active minutes
(95% CI, �0.2 to 11.2), although this was not significant.

 The results for the daily step counts with a time-varying
effect are shown in Table 2. While there are 8 parameters and
several interactions, including a 3-way interaction, many of
the variables are 0, reducing the complexity of the equation.
For instance, for those in the FB group, the MT variable is 0,
and any interaction involving MT can be ignored. During the
baseline period, the total number of steps taken was very
similar between the groups (MT effect=�66.8; 95% CI, �1476
to 1336). However, once the intervention started, there was
an immediate increase of 2183 (95% CI, 992–3344) steps per
day in MT above and beyond the effect observed in the
controls. After the start of the intervention, both groups
exhibited regression to the mean with a decreasing number of
steps taken, on average, with each day from the start of the
intervention. The decay was significantly faster in MT, at a
loss of 44.7 (95% CI, �51.0 to �38.0) steps per day each day
since the start of the intervention compared to 24.3 steps/
day (95% CI, �32.4 to �17.3).
Similarly, there was an increase in active minutes among
MT at the start of the intervention, Table 3. The interpretation
of the model is similar for Model 1 but instead of using steps
per day as the response, Model 2 is focused on the number of
minutes when subjects took at least 100 steps (eg, active
minutes). At baseline, the number of active minutes did not
vary between the groups (MT versus FB, �2.1; 95% CI, �10.3
to 6.0). However, immediately after the start of the interven-
tion, the active minutes per day increased by 12.8 (95% CI,
6.3–19.3) minutes in MT above and beyond the changes in
FB. After the intervention started, both groups exhibited
regression to the mean, with the average number of active
minutes decreasing by 0.3 (95% CI, �0.33 to �0.25) minutes

 per day among MT and 0.1 (95% CI, �0.17 to �0.08) minutes
per day among FB subjects.
Compliance rates varied between the groups and over time
(Figure 4). At baseline, after accounting for within-subject
clustering, there were data for 88.7% (95% CI, 84.1–93.4) of
the subject days in the FB arm. Compliance was 5.0
percentage points higher in MT, although this effect was not
significant (95% CI, �1.4 to 11.5). After the start of the
intervention, compliance was only 64.6% (95% CI, 58.2–71.0)
among those in the FB arm, and the MT arm compliance was
16.5 percentage points higher (95% CI, 7.6–25.4).
Compliance rates were time varying (see Figure 4 and
Table 4). The odds of compliance for the MT group compared
to the control group were 1.85, but these odds were not
significantly different than 1 (95% CI, 0.67–5.16). However,
the odds of compliance fell significantly during the preinter-
vention period (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68–0.95), and
continued to fall during the intervention period.
A total of 72 MT participants completed the postinterven-
tion process-evaluation survey (Figure 5). The majority of
participants indicated that they enjoyed playing MapTrek; they
found it easy to play; they could play it in their spare time;
MapTrek made them feel more supported in physical activity;
and it made them more likely to wear their Fitbit and be
active.
Discussion
The primary findings from this study suggest that the MapTrek
game was effective at dramatically increasing daily step counts
initially. Immediately after the start of the intervention, MT
players took an average of 2183 (95% CI, 992–3344) more
steps per day than controls. An increase of 2000 steps per day
is clinically meaningful as it has been associated with a 10%
relative reduction in long-term incidence of cardiovascular
disease.35 Further, the MT group was walking an average of

 7100 steps per day upon enrollment, which would place them in
the “low active” step index before receiving the intervention.36
An increase of 2000 steps per day would place the majority of
participants into the “somewhat active” step index. This is
important given that the greatest physical activity–induced
health benefits are realized by those who are least active.37
While this effect does not persist indefinitely, and the MT group
appears to have a more rapidly decreasing step count with time,
even 9 weeks after the start of the intervention, the average
MapTrek player took 900 more steps per day than the average
subject randomized to the FB group.
The MT group also significantly increased the number of
active minutes, suggesting that MapTrek was effective for both
promoting more steps but also more purposeful steps taken at
a moderate intensity.38 According to the model described in
Table 3, at the start of the intervention, the FB group had an
average of 24.4 active minutes per day. The MT group spent an
additional 12.8 (95% CI, 6.3–19.3) minutes per day active or a
total of 37.2 minutes according to the model. The additional
12.8 minutes per day adds 89.6 minutes per week to the
170.8 minutes the FB subjects spent active. The MT average of
260.4 active minutes per week is 73% more than the
recommended Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.2 A
2011 study by Wen and colleagues,39 which found that
achieving 92 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic
activity was associated with a 14% (95% CI, 9%–19%) reduction
in all-cause mortality and an additional 3 years in life
expectancy compared to controls who exercised for <1 hour
per week. Additionally, for each additional 15 minutes spent
above the 92 minute per week threshold, there was a further
4% (95% CI, 2.5–7.0) reduction in all-cause mortality.39
While we were not able to identify other studies that have
tested the effect of gamifying pedometer-measured step
counts, our findings can be compared with a few recent
mHealth interventions that have incorporated pedometers
and text messages to increase physical activity. The mActive
study tested a fully automated mHealth intervention that
combined the FitBug Orb wearable accelerometer with
physician-written, theory-based smart text messages sent 3
times per day against a control group that received only the
FitBug Orb.40 When participants received the text messages,
they significantly increased their steps by 2534 steps per
day (95% CI, 1318–3750).40 However, when the mHealth
intervention did not include the text messaging, activity
levels were not significantly different between the 2 groups.
The authors concluded that the texting aspect of the
intervention was crucial for increasing daily activity. It is
notable that this intervention was only 5 weeks in duration
and was performed in a sample of individuals recruited from
a cardiovascular disease rehabilitation center, a population
considerably different than the sedentary office workers
enrolled in our study.40
The use of the Fitbit combined with our innovative platform
that utilizes the Fitbit application programming interface
allowed us to measure steps on a daily and minute-by-minute
basis, which allowed for some novel examinations of trends in
physical activity over the course of the intervention. For
example, following the initial 2200 step per day increase in
daily steps, the MapTrek group demonstrated a progressive
decay of daily steps back to baseline levels over the course of
the intervention. This finding suggests that more research is
needed to identify improvements needed to maintain partici-
pant engagement. Data collected from the process evaluation
data suggest that 8 of 48 respondents (17%) reported Fitbit
battery issues were the primary barrier to playing MapTrek.
Commonly recommended improvements for the game included
making the game more interactive, sending more reminder text
messages during the day to sync the Fitbit, sending rewarding
text messages for completing a challenge, and providing a
better explanation of the game rules. Each of these factors
should be considered in future iterations of the MapTrek game.
The process evaluation data also suggested that partici-
pants thought the game was fun and easy to play. Importantly,
participants reported that it motivated them to be more active
and wear their Fitbit more. This report was verified with the
Fitbit data, which indicate that MT participants were more
likely than FB participants to wear their Fitbit daily. However,
this raises the question of whether the increased wear time
explained the observed difference in steps between the 2
groups. It is possible that more compliant participants are
fundamentally different than less compliant participants and
are just more active. Indeed, in an unadjusted analysis, there
was a moderately strong correlation (r=0.34, 95% CI, 0.19–
0.48) between average daily step counts and the percentage of
days when the Fitbit was worn. However, when we accounted
for percent compliance within the daily step counts analysis,
the effect of MapTrek slightly decreased from 2182.6 steps
per day to 2119 steps per day (95% CI, 1038.0–3368.5).
Therefore, because compliance did not have a large effect on
MapTrek effectiveness, we believe this provides more confi-
dence that the MapTrek intervention was effective at increas-
ing physical activity in this study (model not shown).
The granular-level physical activity data collected in this
study can also be used to identify unique patterns of physical
activity completed over the course of a given day. We were able
to examine bouts of sedentary behavior (consecutive minutes
with 0 steps recorded) on a minute-by-minute level. The
average longest sedentary bout between 8 AM and 8 PM during
baseline in the FB group was 139.1 (95% CI, 106.2–172.4)
minutes per day in the FB arm and not different among players
of MT (MT versus FB, �5.4; 95% CI, 50.8-minute decrease to
39.7-minute increase). However, immediately after the start of
the game, there was a 26.6-minute decrease (95% CI, 70.9-
minute decrease to 17.3-minute increase) in the mean longest

 sedentary time among those randomized to MT compared to
controls (data not shown). This information provides further
context on how physical activity and sedentary behavior
patterns differed between these 2 groups. Future studies could
use these data to further enhance the efficacy of the MapTrek
intervention by individualizing specific activity challenges.
Consistent with many other mobile phone–based applica-
tions used in research,41 we experienced a technical barrier
that could have affected the findings. During week 6 of the
intervention, a bug with our platform occurred that resulted in
MT participants receiving a high volume of text messages on a
single day (due to the change from daylight savings to standard
time). Subsequently, we stopped sending messages for 1 week
and then resumed. This had a significant impact on participants’
Fitbit compliance rates during week 6 (see Figure 4). However,
once the intervention resumed, compliance rates appear to
have returned to prebug levels. In a sensitivity analysis
considering only the data collected before the bug, the effect
of MapTrek was +2071 steps per day (95% CI, 917–3216), a
difference of 112 steps per day from the model using all of the
data. These estimates (2071 steps per day versus 2183 steps
per day) are clinically identical, and their 95% CIs both exclude 0
and include the alternative estimate. As a result, the interpre-
tation of the data collected until the bug occurred and the entire
data set are functionally identical.
Other limitations to this study include the relatively short
duration and a fairly homogenous sample. Participants were
mostly white, non-Hispanic, middle-class women; thus, the
generalizability of the findings to other populations is limited.
The study also had many strengths. This study tested a
novel intervention that combined gamification of a widely
used physical activity monitor with automated text messages.
While several improvements can be made to improve
participant engagement, this approach has potential as a
low-cost and scalable approach for promoting physical activity
among populations in need. This study also utilized a novel
approach for measuring daily physical activity levels at a
granular level. This approach allows for the exploration into
how the intervention impacts daily and even hourly physical
activity patterns over time. This information could be used to
inform future improvements to the game for the purpose of
promoting increased daily steps and to minimize bouts of
sedentary behaviors.
Conclusions
These data suggest the mobile health MapTrek game yielded
clinically significant increases in daily physical activity among
a sample of sedentary office workers. Further research is
warranted to promote sustained participant engagement and
physical activity changes over time.
