abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Data are limited on the behavioral risk correlates of synthetic 
cannabinoid use. The purpose of this study was to compare the behavioral risk correlates of 
synthetic cannabinoid use with those among marijuana users.
METHODS: Data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a cross-sectional survey conducted 
in a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9 through 12 (N = 15 624), were 
used to examine the association between self-reported type of marijuana use (ie, never 
use of marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids, ever use of marijuana only, and ever use of 
synthetic cannabinoids) and self-report of 36 risk behaviors across 4 domains: substance 
use, injury/violence, mental health, and sexual health. Multivariable models were used to 
calculate adjusted prevalence ratios.
RESULTS: Students who ever used synthetic cannabinoids had a significantly greater 
likelihood of engaging in each of the behaviors in the substance use and sexual risk domains 
compared with students who ever used marijuana only. Students who ever used synthetic 
cannabinoids were more likely than students who ever used marijuana only to have used 
marijuana before age 13 years, to have used marijuana ≥1 times during the past 30 days, 
and to have used marijuana ≥20 times during the past 30 days. Several injury/violence 
behaviors were more prevalent among students who ever used synthetic cannabinoids 
compared with students who ever used marijuana only.
CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals and school-based substance use prevention programs 
should include strategies focused on the prevention of both synthetic cannabinoids and 
marijuana.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Although the 
effects of synthetic cannabinoids are similar to 
marijuana, synthetic cannabinoids can be more 
potent and may result in adverse health effects not 
commonly observed with marijuana. Information 
on synthetic cannabinoid use among high school 
students is limited.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study contributes 
to the limited epidemiologic data on synthetic 
cannabinoid use among high school students. 
Furthermore, this study shows that synthetic 
cannabinoid use is associated with a higher 
prevalence of health risk behaviors than observed 
with marijuana use alone.

Synthetic cannabinoids, frequently 
referred to as “synthetic marijuana” 
by the general public, are a group of 
compounds that produce an effect 
similar to the psychoactive ingredient 
in cannabis (tetrahydrocannabinol 
[THC]). 
1 
– 
3 In contrast to marijuana, 
synthetic cannabinoids are not 
derived from a plant; instead, the 
compounds are synthesized in a 
laboratory. Although the effects of 
these synthetic compounds may be 
similar to the natural THC compound 
in cannabis, they may be more 
potent and can result in adverse 
health effects not commonly seen 
with THC. 
1 According to data from 
poison centers in the United States, 
the use of synthetic cannabinoids has 
resulted in tachycardia, drowsiness/
lethargy, nausea, vomiting, agitation/
irritability, hypertension, chest pain, 
hallucinations/delusions, confusion, 
and dizziness/vertigo.3 
– 
5 Severe 
effects that have been noted include 
seizures, permanent cardiovascular 
damage, renal damage, stroke, 
psychosis, paranoia, aggression, 
anxiety attacks, dependence, and 
death (through suicide, adverse 
reaction, or overdose). 
1,

–11 
The toxic effects of synthetic 
cannabinoids result from the type, 
mixture, and amount of product 
used. 
12 Furthermore, producers 
of synthetic cannabinoid products 
frequently change formulas to 
avoid detection and regulation, 
 
4 so 
a user’s experience with synthetic 
cannabinoids can vary over time. 
13, 
 
14
Synthetic cannabinoids have been 
marketed as herbal incense and 
may be available for purchase 
through gas stations, headshops 
and other specialized stores, as 
well as the Internet. 
1, 
 
3, 
 
4, 
 
15 Users 
of synthetic cannabinoids have 
cited several motivations for use, 
such as an expectation that it may 
provide a more intense high than 
that experienced with marijuana, 
affordability, ease of access, to avoid 
detection from standard drug tests, 
and the belief that it is safe.13, 
 
16, 
 
17 
Unfortunately, deceptive marketing 
techniques, such as labeling synthetic 
cannabinoids as a safe and “natural” 
blend of herbs, have been used, which 
gives users the false impression that 
synthetic cannabinoids are a safe 
drug alternative. 
15
To date, few epidemiologic data on 
the use of synthetic cannabinoids 
among adolescents and young 
adults have been available. 
1, 
 
18 
Available research comes from 
case studies, poison center, and 
emergency department data, which 
have sought to describe the adverse 
outcomes associated with the use of 
synthetic cannabinoids.

–5, 
 
13, 
 
19 To 
our knowledge, only 1 study, which 
used the nationally representative 
Monitoring the Future (MTF) data 
to explore the use of synthetic 
cannabinoids among 12th-grade 
high school students, examined 
behavioral correlates of synthetic 
cannabinoid use in an adolescent 
population. 
1 That study reported 
that past-year use of synthetic 
cannabinoids was 10.1% and that 
the use of synthetic cannabinoids 
was correlated with other substance 
use behaviors such as ever use of 
alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and 
other illicit drugs. 
1 Unfortunately, 
because the MTF study does not 
collect data on other behavioral 
domains such as sexual health, injury, 
violence, and mental health among 
the sample of 12th-grade students, 
researchers have not been able to 
explore associations between other 
health risk behaviors and synthetic 
cannabinoid use among high school 
students.
The 2015 national Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey (YRBS) included, 
for the first time, a measure of ever 
synthetic cannabinoid use among 
high school students. The inclusion 
of this variable allows for an 
exploration of behavioral correlates 
of synthetic cannabinoid use among 
students in the United States. This 
study has 2 primary objectives: (1) 
to identify behavioral correlates of 
ever synthetic cannabinoid use and 
(2) to compare observed behavioral 
correlates of ever synthetic 
cannabinoid use with those of ever 
marijuana only use.
METHODS
Study Population
The US Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention has conducted 
the national YRBS biennially since 
1991. The YRBS is a school-based, 
cross-sectional survey that uses 
an independent 3-stage cluster 
sample design to obtain a nationally 
representative sample of students 
in grades 9 through 12 who attend 
public and private schools in the 50 
states and the District of Columbia. 
20 
Participation in the YRBS is both 
anonymous and voluntary, and 
the YRBS adheres to local parental 
permission requirements. Students 
complete a self-administered 
questionnaire during a regular class 
period, with responses recorded 
on an answer sheet or computer-
scannable questionnaire booklet. For 
2015, the school-level response rate 
was 69%, the student-level response 
rate was 86%, and the overall 
response rate was 60%. 
21 The sample 
size for the 2015 YRBS was 15 624 
students. 
21 YRBS data are weighted 
to account for the oversampling of 
Hispanic and black students, as well 
as to adjust for school and student 
nonresponse. Imputation is not used 
for missing data. Information on 
the psychometric properties of the 
YRBS questionnaire as well as more 
detailed information on sampling 
strategies have been published 
elsewhere. 
20, 
22 The national YRBS 
was reviewed and approved by an 
institutional review board at the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.
Measures
All behavioral measures were 
assessed by self-report. Ever use of 
synthetic cannabinoids was assessed

with the following question: “During 
your life, how many times have 
you used synthetic marijuana (also 
called K2, Spice, fake weed, King 
Kong, Yucatan Fire, Skunk, or Moon 
Rocks)?” Ever use of marijuana 
was assessed with the question, 
“During your life, how many 
times have you used marijuana?” 
Response options for both ever 
use of synthetic cannabinoids 
and ever use of marijuana were 
combined to form 2 groups: “1 or 
more times” or “0 times.” These 
variables were then combined 
to construct a 3-level variable to 
describe the type of marijuana use: 
(1) never use of marijuana and 
synthetic cannabinoids, (2) ever use 
of marijuana only, and (3) ever use 
of synthetic cannabinoids. It should 
be noted that most students in the 
category of “ever use of synthetic 
cannabinoids” also reported ever 
use of marijuana. In fact, only 
1.6% of all students who ever 
used synthetic cannabinoids had 
not used marijuana. We examined 
36 health risk behaviors from the 
domains of substance use, injury/
violence, mental health, and sexual 
health (assessed on the YRBS) to 
determine the relative strength of 
their association with the 3-level 
marijuana use variable ( 
Table 1). 
Demographic characteristics 
assessed in this analysis included 
sex, grade (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) 
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic), 
and geographic region.
Data Analysis
To account for the complex sample 
design of the survey, we conducted 
all analyses by using SUDAAN 
statistical software (Research 
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle 
Park, NC). We conducted descriptive 
analyses to present the distribution 
of demographic variables by type 
of marijuana use (never use versus 
ever use of marijuana only, never 
use versus ever use of synthetic 
cannabinoids, and ever use of 
marijuana only versus ever use 
of synthetic cannabinoids) and 
compared distributions by using the 
χ2 test. We assessed the associations 
between type of marijuana use 
(independent variable) and the 
15 variables in the substance use 
domain (outcome variables) with 
logistic regression models that 
calculated adjusted prevalence ratios 
(aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs). Three substance use outcome 
variables (first marijuana use at 
age <13 years, current marijuana use, 
and current frequent marijuana use, 
defined as using marijuana ≥20 
times during the past 30 days) 
were not applicable to students 
who never used marijuana and, 
as a result, analyses with these 3 
outcomes were conducted with 
a 2-level response variable: ever 
marijuana use only (referent value) 
and ever synthetic cannabinoid 
use. All models in the substance 
use domain included sex, race/
ethnicity, and grade as covariates. 
Models excluded geographic region 
because this variable was not 
significant in bivariate analyses. 
The associations between type 
of ever use of marijuana only 
(independent variable) and the 21 
outcome variables in the remaining 
health behavior domains (ie, injury/
violence, mental health, and sexual 
health) were also assessed with 
logistic regression models that 
calculated aPRs and 95% CIs. Each 
of these models included sex, race/
ethnicity, grade, nonmedical use 
of prescription drugs, and other 
illicit drug use (including inhalants, 
hallucinogens, cocaine, heroin, 
methamphetamines, and ecstasy) 
as covariates. It was necessary 
to include these substance use 
variables as covariates in the models 
for injury/violence, mental health, 
and sexual health domains because 
previous research has revealed that 
other types of substance use are 
associated with marijuana use as well 
as injury/violence, mental health, and 
sexual health behaviors. 
1, 
 
18, 
 
23 
–25 
Linear contrasts were conducted 
to compare results for all health 
behavior domains by type of 
marijuana use (never use versus 
ever use of marijuana only, never 
use versus ever use of synthetic 
cannabinoids, and ever use of 
marijuana only versus ever use of 
synthetic cannabinoids). Significant 
differences were denoted by P < .05.
RESULTS
Nationwide, 61.1% of students 
never used marijuana and synthetic 
cannabinoids, 29.5% ever used 
marijuana only, and 9.4% ever used 
synthetic cannabinoids ( 
Table 2). 
Only 22.8% of students who ever 
used marijuana also ever used 
synthetic cannabinoids; however, 
98.4% students who ever used 
synthetic cannabinoids reported ever 
use of marijuana (data not shown). 
The type of marijuana use varied 
significantly by sex, race/ethnicity, 
and grade, but not by geographic 
region ( 
Table 2).
The adjusted prevalence of every 
substance use behavior included 
in our analysis was greater among 
students who ever used synthetic 
cannabinoids (aPRs ranged from 4.85 
for current alcohol use to 151.90 for 
ever use of heroin) and students who 
ever used marijuana only (aPRs: 3.45 
for current alcohol use to 15.78 for 
ever use of ecstasy) compared with 
students who never used marijuana 
and synthetic cannabinoids ( 
Table 3). 
According to the results of the 
linear contrasts, students who ever 
used synthetic cannabinoids had a 
consistently greater likelihood of 
engaging in all other substance use 
behaviors than students who ever 
used marijuana only. In models 
that compared marijuana outcomes 
among students who ever used 
marijuana only versus students who 
ever used synthetic cannabinoids, 
those who ever used synthetic 
cannabinoids were more likely to

have tried marijuana before 13 years 
of age (aPR = 2.35), be a current 
marijuana user (aPR = 1.36), and be a 
current frequent marijuana user 
(aPR = 1.88).
The adjusted prevalence of most 
health risk behaviors in the domains 
of injury/violence, mental health, 
and sexual health was greater among 
students who ever used synthetic 
cannabinoids and students who ever 
used marijuana only compared with 
students who did not use marijuana 
and synthetic cannabinoids ( 
Table 4). 
In the injury/violence domain, 
compared with students who did 
not use marijuana and synthetic 
cannabinoids, ever use of marijuana 
only was significantly associated 
with 8 of the 11 behaviors and ever 
use of synthetic cannabinoids was 
significantly associated with 10 of 
the 11 behaviors. Linear contrasts 
showed that 3 of the injury/violence 
behaviors were significantly more 
likely to occur among students who 
ever used synthetic cannabinoids 
compared with students who ever 
used marijuana only, as follows: (1) 
rode with a driver who had been 
drinking alcohol, (2) did not go to 
school because of safety concerns, 
and (3) engaged in a physical 
fight. Both ever use of marijuana 
only and ever use of synthetic 
cannabinoids were associated 
with the 3 outcomes in the mental 
health domain, but no significant 
differences were identified between 
ever use of marijuana only and ever 
use of synthetic cannabinoids in 
the observed associations. For the 
sexual health domain, ever use of 
marijuana only was associated with 
6 of the 7 sexual risk behaviors and 
ever use of synthetic cannabinoids 
was associated with all 7 sexual 
risk behaviors. According to linear 
contrasts, all 7 of the sexual risk 
behaviors were significantly more 
likely to occur among students who 
ever used synthetic cannabinoids 
compared with students who ever 
used marijuana only.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first 
study to explore the association 
between ever use of synthetic 
cannabinoids and health risk 
behaviors in domains such as 
injury/violence, mental health, and 
sexual health among a nationally 
representative sample of US high 
school students. Furthermore, this 
study contributes new evidence on 
how behavioral correlates differ by 
type of marijuana use. Overall, we 
observed that ever use of synthetic 
cannabinoids was associated with 
the majority of health risk behaviors 
included in our study and that those 
associations tended to be more 
pronounced for ever use of synthetic

cannabinoids than for ever use of 
marijuana only, particularly for 
substance use behaviors and sexual 
risk behaviors.
Given that synthetic cannabinoids 
are a relatively recent issue in the 
United States, high school students’ 
use of the drug was not monitored in 
national surveillance systems until 
the 2011 MTF study cycle 
1 and the 
2015 YRBS cycle. 
21 As a result, much 
of the available literature on the use 
of synthetic cannabinoid is primarily 
focused on emergency department 
and poison center data.

19 With 
such limited information available 
on the correlates of synthetic 
cannabinoid use, no studies were 
identified with which we can 
compare our findings on health 
behavior domains such as injury, 
violence, mental health, and sexual 
health. However, a small number 
of studies conducted in adolescent 
and/or adult populations identified 
similar associations between the use 
of synthetic cannabinoids and other 
substance use behaviors. 
1, 
 
18, 
26 
For example, Winstock and Barratt 
26 
conducted an anonymous online 
survey of a nonrepresentative 
sample of >15 000 respondents from 
around the world and observed 
a high prevalence of other self-
reported substance use behaviors 
among past-year users of synthetic 
cannabinoids: alcohol (97.8%), 
marijuana (95.0%), tobacco (84.2%), 
ecstasy (50.7%), and mushrooms 
(36.9%). Furthermore, in a study 
conducted in patients aged ≥18 
years in a residential substance use 
disorder treatment program in the 
Midwest, ever users of synthetic 
cannabinoids, compared with never 
users of synthetic cannabinoids, had 
a significantly greater prevalence 
of using heroin, methadone, 
prescription opioids, prescription 
sedatives, amphetamines, ecstasy, 
marijuana, hallucinogens, inhalants, 
and tobacco. 
18 Last, in the MTF study 
of synthetic cannabinoid use among 
12th-grade students, synthetic 
cannabinoid use was associated 
with ever use of alcohol, marijuana, 
and other illicit drugs and cigarette 
smoking. 
1
In our study, >98% of students who 
ever used synthetic cannabinoids 
also ever used marijuana. This 
almost complete overlap in 
marijuana use among users of 
synthetic cannabinoids has also been 
observed by other researchers. 
18, 
 
26 
We observed that students who 
ever used synthetic cannabinoids 
were more likely to have currently 
used marijuana and to have 
currently frequently used marijuana 
compared with students who ever 
used marijuana only. Furthermore, 
students who ever used synthetic 
cannabinoids were more than twice 
as likely to have tried marijuana 
before age 13 years compared with 
students who ever used marijuana 
only, suggesting that early marijuana 
use may have been a risk factor for 
subsequent synthetic cannabinoid 
use among our study population. 
Youth may progress from marijuana 
use only to the use of synthetic 
cannabinoids for a variety of reasons, 
such as ease of access, perception of 
safety, and ability to be undetected 
by many drug tests. Because our 
data are cross-sectional, and the 
2015 YRBS did not have a question 
that captured the age of initiation of 
synthetic cannabinoid use (which

we could have compared with the 
age of marijuana initiation), we are 
limited in our ability to investigate 
this relationship further. Although 
data on the relationship between 
marijuana use and the use of 
synthetic cannabinoids are limited, 
it should be noted that researchers 
have described marijuana use 
as a risk factor for subsequent 
use of other illicit drugs. 
27, 
 
28 For 
example, in a retrospective cohort 
study on drug use in 29 393 French 
adolescents, the risk of other illicit 
drug use was 21 times greater among 
cannabis experimenters and 124 
times greater among daily cannabis 
users compared with nonusers.27 
Much of the published literature has 
focused on identifying predictors 
of progression from cannabis use 
to other illicit drug use. 
27 Some 
predictors that have been described 
include a genetic predisposition, 
depressive symptoms, stress, peer 
influence, early onset of cannabis 
use, high frequency of cannabis use, 
and drug availability. 
27, 
 
29 
 
 
 
– 
35 Some of 
these predictors are a difficult target 
for public health prevention efforts 
(ie, genetic predisposition), but 
preventing the initiation of marijuana 
use, particularly among early 
adolescents (before age 13 years), 
may have an impact on reducing 
the use of synthetic cannabinoids 
and other illicit substance use 
behaviors. According to data from 
the nationally representative 2014 
School Health Policies and Practices 
Study, many elementary and middle 
schools do not emphasize substance 
use prevention in health education 
instruction (50.0% of elementary 
schools, 66.7% of middle schools,

CLAYTON et al 
and 86.9% of high schools require 
instruction on alcohol or other drug 
use prevention).36 Nationwide, 
opportunities to provide coverage of 
substance abuse prevention topics 
in school health education programs 
aimed at early adolescents are 
certainly being missed.
It is unclear what impact the 
legalization of marijuana will 
have on the use of synthetic 
cannabinoids. If marijuana use 
becomes more socially acceptable, 
adolescents may be more likely to try 
marijuana, although the evidence is 
conflicting. 
37 
 
– 
40 There is a concern 
that if marijuana use increases, the 
use of synthetic marijuana may also 
increase. Fortunately, federal and 
state legislative and enforcement 
efforts have greatly reduced access 
to synthetic cannabinoids. For 
example, changes in the legal status 
of synthetic cannabinoids are thought 
to have contributed to declining 
use among high school students, 
with past-year use of synthetic 
cannabinoids decreasing among 
12th-graders from 11.3% in 2012 to 
5.3% in 2015.41 Despite the evidence 
that synthetic cannabinoid use is 
declining, recent reports indicate 
that synthetic cannabinoids are still 
available and that acute poisonings 
from synthetic cannabinoids have 
increased. 
4, 
 
42, 
 
43
There are several limitations of our 
study. Because our data are cross-
sectional, it was not possible to 
determine the temporality of the 
associations we observed between 
type of marijuana use and health 
risk behavior domains. Furthermore, 
behaviors were self-reported; 
therefore, it was not possible to 
determine the extent to which 
over- or underreporting occurred, 
but it should be noted that YRBS 
questions have generally shown good 
test-retest reliability. 
20, 
 
22 Because 
these data apply only to adolescents 
who attend school, they are not 
representative of all individuals 
in this age group. 
44 Nationwide, in 
2012, only ∼3% of individuals aged 
16 through 17 years were either not 
enrolled in a high school program or 
had not completed high school.
CONCLUSIONS
The use of synthetic cannabinoids 
has emerged as an important public 
health issue among high school 
students due to the popularity of 
the behavior (1 of 10 students) 
and the severity of the adverse 
consequences associated with use. 
Our results indicate that students 
who use synthetic cannabinoids tend 
to engage in more risky behaviors 
than students who use marijuana 
only. To prevent marijuana use and 
the use of synthetic cannabinoids, it 
is important that health professionals 
and school-based substance 
prevention programs include 
strategies that reduce the initiation of 
marijuana and synthetic cannabinoid 
use, particularly among students 
younger than 13 years of age.
