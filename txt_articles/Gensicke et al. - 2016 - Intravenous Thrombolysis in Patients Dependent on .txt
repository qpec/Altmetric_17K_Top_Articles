Background and Purpose—We compared outcome and complications in patients with stroke treated with intravenous 
thrombolysis (IVT) who could not live alone without help of another person before stroke (dependent patients) versus 
independent ones.
Methods—In a multicenter IVT-register–based cohort study, we compared previously dependent (prestroke modified Rankin 
Scale score, 3–5) versus independent (prestroke modified Rankin Scale score, 0–2) patients. Outcome measures were 
poor 3-month outcome (not reaching at least prestroke modified Rankin Scale [dependent patients]; modified Rankin 
Scale score of 3–6 [independent patients]), death, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Unadjusted and adjusted 
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (OR [95% confidence interval]) were calculated.
Results—Among 7430 IVT-treated patients, 489 (6.6%) were dependent and 6941 (93.4%) were independent. Previous 
stroke, dementia, heart, and bone diseases were the most common causes of preexisting dependency. Dependent patients 
were more likely to die (ORunadjusted, 4.55 [3.74–5.53]; ORadjusted, 2.19 [1.70–2.84]). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage 
occurred equally frequent (4.8% versus 4.5%). Poor outcome was more frequent in dependent (60.5%) than in independent 
(39.6%) patients, but the adjusted ORs were similar (ORadjusted, 0.95 [0.75–1.21]). Among survivors, the proportion of 
patients with poor outcome did not differ (35.7% versus 31.3%). After adjustment for age and stroke severity, the odds of 
poor outcome were lower in dependent patients (ORadjusted, 0.64 [0.49–0.84]).
Conclusions—IVT-treated stroke patients who were dependent on the daily help of others before stroke carry a higher 
mortality risk than previously independent patients. The risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and the likelihood 
of poor outcome were not independently influenced by previous dependency. Among survivors, poor outcome was 
avoided at least as effectively in previously dependent patients. Thus, withholding IVT in previously dependent patients 
might not be justified.

 Gensicke et al  Intravenous Thrombolysis and Prestroke Dependency   451
I
ntravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is efficacious and safe in 
patients with acute ischemic stroke.1 However, it is unclear 
whether this is also true for patients who could not live alone 
without daily help of another person prior to stroke (ie, modi-
fied Rankin Scale score of ≥3).2 Such patients were not eli-
gible for the large controlled randomized IVT trials including 
third international stroke trial (IST-3).3 In clinical practice, 
some patients with preexisting dependency receive IVT,4 
whereas others do not.5 The present study aimed at investigat-
ing the impact of preexisting dependency on outcomes and 
(bleeding) complications in a large population of IVT-treated 
stroke patients.
Methods
As a joint initiative of 12 European stroke centers, the Thrombolysis 
in Ischemic Stroke Patients (TriSP) investigators performed a large 
collaborative clinical cohort study.
All participating centers treated patients with acute ischemic 
stroke with IVT according to current guidelines (http://www.eso-
stroke.org/eso-stroke/education/guidelines.html).
Data from individual patients were collected with a standardized 
form with predefined variables as it was done in previous studies.6–9 
Local study investigators filled in the forms systematically using pro-
spectively ascertained in-hospital intravenous ischemic stroke throm-
bolysis registries. Completed forms from all centers were compiled 
in the coordinating center Basel, where the analysis of the pooled 
data was performed, as done previously.6,7 The study was approved by 
the ethics committee in Basel, Switzerland. The requirement for ad-
ditional local ethical approval differed between participating centers 
and was obtained if required.
The following prospectively ascertained variables were used: age, 
sex, modified Rankin Scale before stroke (prestroke mRS), initial 
stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke 
Scale score,10 blood pressure before IVT, onset-to-treatment time, re-
nal function as quantified by the estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration7) and glucose 
levels in blood serum, vascular risk factors according to predefined cri-
teria,11 and previous treatment with antithrombotic agents (antiplatelet 
agents or anticoagulants). Prestroke mRS score had been estimated by 
the stroke physicians who also indicated and applied IVT. The scores 
were based on information provided by patients and next-to-kin dur-
ing the information about benefits and risks of IVT, and all written re-
ports available before IVT. Functional 3-month outcome was assessed 
with the mRS by using a structured interview at outpatient visits or 
telephone calls with patients or relatives. There was monitoring for 
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) by follow-up computed tomography or 
magnetic resonance imaging as done in previous research.6,7
Each center reported on the period for which they had prospec-
tively collected data on consecutive patients up to November 30, 2014 
(Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). All patients with miss-
ing prestroke mRS and missing 3-month outcome data were exclud-
ed. Preexisting dependency was defined by a prestroke mRS score of 
3 to 5, while preexisting independency meant a prestroke mRS score 
of 0, 1, or 2.
Outcome and complication measures were as follows: (1) poor 
functional 3-month outcome, defined as 3-month mRS score of 3 to 
6 in previously independent patients and a 3-month mRS higher than 
the prestroke mRS in previously dependent patients as applied in pre-
vious research12 and shown in Figure 1, (2) death, and (3) symptom-
atic ICH (sICH) according to criteria of the European Cooperative 
Acute Stroke Study (ECASS)-II trial.13
Main Analysis
We investigated the impact of preexisting dependency on outcomes 
by comparing patients who were dependent on the help of others be-
fore stroke (prestroke mRS score, 3–5) with previously independent 
patients (prestroke mRS score, 0–2; Figure 1).
Subgroup Analyses
First, we investigated the impact of different degrees of prestroke de-
pendency on outcomes. Patients who were dependent on the daily 
help of others before stroke were subdivided in those with complete 
dependency (ie, prestroke mRS score, 4–5) and in those patients with 
partial dependency (ie, prestroke mRS score, 3; Figure 1). Second, 
among survivors at 3 months, we studied the impact of prestroke de-
pendency on functional outcome. Third, in a subset of patients, the 
causes of preexisting dependency were available from the following 
centers: Amsterdam, Basel, Berlin, Brescia, and Modena. The diag-
nosis of comorbidities causing dependency was provided by local in-
vestigators and categorized by consensus by three adjudicators (H.G., 
S.C., S.T.E.).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 19.0 for 
Windows; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
For the main analysis, patient’s prestroke mRS was divided into 2 
groups: prestroke mRS score of 0 to 2 and prestroke mRS score of 3 
to 5. Prestroke mRS score of 0 to 2 served as the reference group. For 
subgroup analyses, previously dependent patients were subdivided 
into prestroke mRS score of 3 (partial dependency) and mRS score 
of 4 to 5 (complete dependency). Data were summarized as median 
(±interquartile range). We used Fisher exact test, χ2 test for categori-
cal variables and the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables, 
where appropriate. The association between prestroke mRS and out-
come was estimated by calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confi-
dence intervals (95% CIs), using binary logistic regression models. In 
the multivariable analysis, the models were adjusted for all variables 
with P<0.1 in the univariable analyses.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Data were eligible for analysis in 7430 (89.2%) of the 8327 
IVT-treated patients. Six-hundred fifty-nine (7.9%) patients 
were excluded from analyses because of missing prestroke 
mRS data and 238 (2.9%) because of missing 3-month out-
come data. Among study patients, 6941 (93.4%) were previ-
ously independent and 489 (6.6%) dependent before stroke. 
The latter included 347 patients with prestroke mRS score of 
3, 132 with prestroke mRS score of 4, and 10 patients with 
prestroke mRS score of 5. Previously dependent patients were 
older, more often women, had more severe strokes, more often 
vascular risk factors (except smoking and hypercholesterol-
emia), and were more often on antithrombotic medication than 
previously independent patients (Table 1). The distribution of 
3-month mRS depending on prestroke mRS is presented in 
Figure 2A.
In 5 centers, data on causes of preexisting dependency 
were available. In 193 patients, preexisting dependency was 
caused by a single disease in 133 (68.9%) patients and multi-
factorial in 60 (31.1%) patients. Causes of preexisting depen-
dency included dementia (n=88; 45.6%), previous strokes 
(n=32; 16.6%), heart diseases (n=32; 16.6%), and degenera-
tive or traumatic bone diseases (n=38; 19.7%). Details are 
shown in Table II in the online-only Data Supplement.
Logistic Regression Analyses
In univariable analyses, poor outcome (60.5% versus 39.6%) 
and death (38.7% versus 12.2%) occurred significantly more 
often in patients with previous dependency than in indepen-
dent patients. sICH (4.8% versus 4.5%) occurred equally

often (Table 2; Figure 2B). After adjustment for potentially 
confounding variables, previously dependent patients were at 
increased risk of death (ORadjusted, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.70–2.84; 
P<0.001) but not for poor outcome (ORadjusted, 0.95; 95% CI, 
0.75–1.21). The occurrence of sICH did not differ signifi-
cantly between both groups (Tables 3 and 4).
Different Degrees of Dependency
Patients with complete dependency before stroke (prestroke 
mRS score, 4 or 5) had a higher median National Institutes 
of Health Stroke Scale on admission than patients with par-
tial dependency (prestroke mRS score, 3; Table 1). They died 
significantly more often within 3 months after IVT (48.6% 
versus 34.6%), whereas all other outcome events did not dif-
fer significantly between both groups (Table 2; Figure 2B). 
In regression analyses, the increased likelihood of death for 
those with complete dependency was similar with and with-
out adjustment (ORunadjusted, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.20–2.66; P=0.004 
and ORadjusted, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.11–2.65; P=0.014). The OR for 
poor outcome and sICH did not differ significantly between

Outcome of Survivors
Among survivors, the proportion of patients with poor func-
tional outcome did not differ significantly between previously 
dependent and independent patients (35.7% versus 31.3%; 
ORunadjusted, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.96–1.55; P=0.112). However, after 
adjustment for age and National Institutes of Health Stroke 
Scale, the likelihood for poor outcome was lower in previ-
ously dependent patients (ORadjusted, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49–0.84; 
P=0.001).
Discussion
This exploratory multicenter study addressed the impact of 
preexisting dependency on outcome and complications in IVT-
treated stroke patients. We observed the following key find-
ings: (1) previously dependent patients had a higher 3-month 
mortality rate than previously independent patients. (2) The 
frequency of symptomatic ICH was similar in both groups. 
Among survivors, previously dependent patients had higher 
odds to avoid poor 3-month outcome than independent ones 
if age and stroke severity were taken into account. (4) Causes 
of preexisting dependency were multifactorial in one third of 
patients and mostly caused by dementia, previous stroke, heart 
disease, and degenerative or traumatic bone diseases.
In our cohort, ≈40% of the IVT-treated patients with pre-
existing disability had died within 3 months. This rate is compa-
rable with previous observations in smaller studies, in which 7 of 
14 patients, and 49% among 171 patients with previous depen-
dency (applying the same definition as in our cohort) died within 
3 months.4,12 As a refinement, our data allowed an estimate of 
the mortality risk. After adjustment for confounding variables, 
being previously dependent meant that the likelihood was twice 
as high to die within the next 3 months after IVT when com-
pared with previously independent patients treated with IVT.
In a non–IVT-treated stroke population, preexisting dis-
ability was independently associated with death with an OR of 
2.1 (95% CI, 1.4–3.2),14 virtually identical to that in our IVT-
treated patients (ORadjusted, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.70–2.84).
The observed higher mortality is not explained by an 
excess of bleeds, as sICH occurred as often in dependent as 
in independent patients. Possible explanations for the higher 
3-month mortality among previously dependent patients may 
include (1) a higher susceptibility for complications other 
than sICH, (2) worsening of preexisting comorbid diseases 
triggered by the stroke, (3) a higher disease burden caused by 
preexisting comorbidities in such patients, and (4) withdrawal 
of care according to patient’s preferences.
Furthermore, and as a novelty, our data showed that the 
mortality risk increased with increasing degree of preex-
isting dependency. For patients with preexisting complete 
dependency, the odds for being dead at 3 months were ≈10%

to 250% higher than in patients with partial dependency 
(ORadjusted, 1.72; 1.11–2.65). Interestingly, the odds for poor 
functional outcome did not differ significantly between these 
2 groups.
Patients with previous dependency more often had poor 
functional outcome than previously independent patients 
(60.5% versus 39.6%). However, after adjustment for poten-
tial confounders preexisting dependency did not predict poor 
outcome independently (ORadjusted, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75–1.21). 
This observation is unpreceded and differed from the result 
of a subgroup analysis in another study, suggesting a higher 
risk of poor outcome in patients with preexisting dependency 
(ORadjusted, 1.70; 0.99–2.94).12
Unexpectedly, among survivors, previously dependent 
patients had better odds to avoid poor outcome than inde-
pendent patients in our cohort if age and stroke severity were 
taken into account. We can only speculate on possible reasons: 
(1) our definition of poor outcome (which we adopted from a 
previous study12) differed between both groups and may have 
favored the previously dependent patients. In detail, among 
survivors, dependent patients with a prestroke mRS score of 
3 can only move to an mRS score of 4 or 5, patients with a

prestroke mRS score of 4 only to mRS score of 5, and among 
survivors, patients with a prestroke mRS score of 5 cannot 
have a poor outcome. In contrast, previously independent have 
a greater capacity to have poor outcome (mRS score, 3–5). (2) 
The functional worsening caused by the current stroke (mea-
sured with the mRS) might be less severe in patients with an 
existing impairment of capability in activities of daily living 
as in patients without previous deficits. Thus, we urge to a 
cautious interpretation of this observation. (3) Theoretically, 
one might hypothesize that some causes of preexisting depen-
dency (eg, depression, Parkinson disease, and bone fractures) 
might have improved during the 3-month follow-up with reha-
bilitative and medical therapy.
In previous research, the causes for preexisting disability 
or dependency were not addressed.4,12 In our cohort, causes 
were multiple in about one third of patients. Dementia, 
sequela from previous stroke, heart diseases, and degenerative 
or traumatic bone diseases were the most common causes for 
preexisting dependency. For dementia, 2 recent observational 
studies showed no significant differences in (in-hospital) 
mortality and occurrence of ICH between IVT-treated stroke 
patients with and without dementia.15,16 In turn, dementia 
requiring custodial care has been a reported exclusion criteria 
for IVT in some centers.17 For previous stroke, a large case–
control study showed that such patients seem to benefit from 
IVT when compared with those who were not IVT treated.18 
Thus, taking into account the aforementioned observations 
and our findings, it might be questionable to withhold IVT 
from acute stroke patients with dementia or sequela of pre-
vious strokes even if these comorbidities have had caused 
dependency before the current stroke.
Strengths of this study include (1) the relatively large sam-
ple size, which (a) reduces the risk of chance findings and (b) 
allows adjustment for (potentially) confounding variables; (2) 
a low number of missing data on 3-month outcome (3.1%), 
which reduces the risk of bias, and (3) the systematic and stan-
dardized assessment of data, which were collected prospec-
tively uninfluenced by the current research question.
Nevertheless, we are aware of several limitations: (1) 
data came from registries that were not monitored and non-
randomized. Furthermore, the low frequency of patients with 
preexisting dependency (ie, 6.6%) in our IVT-cohort sug-
gests a selection bias. We do not know how many dependent 
patients were not treated with IVT. More importantly, we do 
not know how dependent patients treated with IVT differed 
from those who did not receive IVT. However, it may be 
assumed that preferentially those dependent patients got IVT, 
who had a favorable prognosis. Thus, the outcomes detected 
in our IVT-treated sample of dependent patients should not 
be considered representative of all dependent patients who 
might be otherwise eligible for IVT. In addition, in ≈8% of the 
patients, information about prestroke mRS was missing. Thus, 
because of these limitations, we urge to a cautious interpre-
tation of our results. (2) We compared previously dependent 
with previously independent patients who both had received 
IVT. To answer the question whether IVT is effective and safe 
in patients with preexisting dependency, a randomized con-
trolled trial comparing IVT versus non-IVT in such patients 
would be required. At least our results indicate that such a 
trial would be ethically justified. (3) Providing outcome data 
separately for the subset of survivors involves the risk that 
outcomes might be perceived inappropriately good. In clinical 
practice, patients (and relatives) often do fear to be alive but 
dependent more than to die after stroke. (4) The assessment 
of the prestroke mRS is challenging, and its reliability is lim-
ited.19 Furthermore, the raters of the mRS at 3 months were 
not blinded to the prestroke mRS, which may have had influ-
enced their rating. (5) The meaning of the causes of preexist-
ing dependency could not be addressed sufficiently because 
such data were only available for a subgroup of patients.
Conclusions
The present study revealed that patients with IVT-treated 
stroke who were dependent on the daily help of others before 
stroke carry a higher mortality risk than previously indepen-
dent patients. However, the risk of sICH was not different 
between these 2 groups, suggesting that IVT is apparently 
safe in this group. Among survivors, the adjusted odds to 
avoid poor outcome were even higher in previously depen-
dent patients. Thus, withholding IVT in previously dependent 
patients might not be justified.
