abstract
CONTEXT: Sensory challenges are common among children with autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions targeting sensory 
challenges in ASD.
DATA SOURCES: Databases, including Medline and PsycINFO.
STUDY SELECTION: Two investigators independently screened studies against predetermined 
criteria.
DATA EXTRACTION: One investigator extracted data with review by a second. Investigators 
independently assessed risk of bias and strength of evidence (SOE), or confidence in the 
estimate of effects.
RESULTS: Twenty-four studies, including 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), were 
included. Only 3 studies had low risk of bias. Populations, interventions, and outcomes 
varied. Limited, short-term studies reported potential positive effects of several approaches 
in discrete skill domains. Specifically, sensory integration-based approaches improved 
sensory and motor skills-related measures (low SOE). Environmental enrichment improved 
nonverbal cognitive skills (low SOE). Studies of auditory integration-based approaches 
did not improve language (low SOE). Massage improved symptom severity and sensory 
challenges in studies with likely overlapping participants (low SOE). Music therapy studies 
evaluated different protocols and outcomes, precluding synthesis (insufficient SOE). 
Some positive effects were reported for other approaches, but findings were inconsistent 
(insufficient SOE).
LIMITATIONS: Studies were small and short-term, and few fully categorized populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Some interventions may yield modest short-term (<6 months) improvements in 
sensory- and ASD symptom severity-related outcomes; the evidence base is small, and the 
durability of the effects is unclear. Although some therapies may hold promise, substantial 
needs exist for continuing improvements in methodologic rigor.

 As defined by the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), 
features of autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) include deficits in social skills 
and communication; restricted 
and repetitive behaviors; excessive 
adherence to routine; intense interest 
patterns, and atypical sensory 
interests or responses.1 Although 
challenging to operationalize and 
measure clinically, estimates indicate 
that 42% to 88% of people with ASD 
have impairments related to sensory 
processing that include both hyper- 
and hyporesponsiveness.2 
– 
4 Sensory 
symptoms can involve both strong 
interests and aversions.
Sensory-focused interventions 
commonly target aversions/
challenges, meeting needs for 
sensory input within adaptive 
frameworks, or may target perceived 
processing deficits, with the goal 
of improving people’s abilities to 
interact with their environments. For 
example, a child with ASD may have 
difficulty tolerating bright lights, 
clothing or food textures, specific 
noises, daily living tasks, touch, or 
more idiosyncratic stimuli, such as 
certain colors. Alternatively, some 
children with may ASD may show a 
fascination with visually examining 
objects, seeking out certain textures 
to rub/touch (eg, clothing or hair), 
or experiencing the sound of certain 
objects/actions. These sensitivities 
and interests can interfere 
significantly with children’s abilities 
to care for themselves, leave the 
home, participate in school, and be 
involved in social situations.
Although sensory challenges are 
common and impairing features of 
ASD for many, research examining 
the nature of sensory impairments 
across the life span has been lacking. 
Specifically, the field has historically 
lacked accepted frameworks for 
diagnosing sensory challenges (eg, 
sensory symptoms were not part 
of DSM diagnostic criteria until 
DSM-5) and developing responsive 
interventions.2, 
 
3, 
 
5, 
 
6 Although an 
increasing number of interventions 
exist, their mechanisms and targets 
for change are not consistently 
defined. Broadly, interventions 
targeting sensory challenges 
involve the incorporation of 
sensory experiences (eg, sounds, 
texture, pressure, and so on) 
to affect a variety of outcomes. 
Consensus is also lacking regarding 
whether interventions work by 
acting on the underlying sensory 
processing differences commonly 
associated with ASD, how specific 
versus general these effects may 
be, and how generalizable any 
improvements may be over time to 
other situations that may tax sensory 
processing systems.
In the present review, a component 
of an Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality-commissioned update 
of a comparative effectiveness 
review of therapies for children with 
ASD conducted by the Vanderbilt 
Evidence-based Practice Center, 
7 we 
examine the evidence specifically 
for interventions targeting sensory 
challenges in children with ASD.

search strategy and study selection
We searched the Medline database 
via PubMed, Embase, and the 
Cochrane Library from January 
2010 to September 2016 using a 
combination of controlled vocabulary 
and key terms related to ASD and 
sensory challenges (eg, autism, ASD, 
and sensory integration). We note 
that the original review, 
9 which the 
current report updates, included 
studies from January 2000 to 2011. 
We also hand-searched the reference 
lists of included articles and recent 
reviews addressing ASD therapies to 
identify potentially relevant articles.
We developed inclusion criteria in 
consultation with an expert panel 
of clinicians and researchers (Table 
1). We included comparative study 
designs (eg, randomized controlled 
trials [RCTs] and prospective or 
retrospective cohort studies) and 
studies published in English. We 
required that eligible RCTs have a 
total minimum sample size of 10. We 
required a higher minimum sample 
size (n = 20) for other comparative 
studies because they typically have 
fewer controls for bias than RCTs.

 data extraction and Analysis
One investigator extracted data 
regarding study design; descriptions 
of study populations, intervention, 
and comparison groups; and 
baseline and outcome data. A second 
investigator independently verified 
the accuracy of the extraction and 
made revisions as needed. Significant 
heterogeneity in interventions and 
outcomes reported precluded meta-
analysis; thus, we synthesized studies 
qualitatively and report descriptive 
statistics in tables (Tables 2 and 3).
Assessment of study Risk of Bias 
and strength of evidence
Two investigators independently 
evaluated the overall methodologic 
risk of bias of individual studies 
using the ASD-specific assessment 
approach developed and used in 
previous reviews of interventions 
for ASD.7, 
 
10, 
 
11 Senior reviewers 
resolved discrepancies in risk-
of-bias assessment, and we used 
an approach described in the full 
review8 to determine low, moderate, 
or high risk-of-bias ratings.
Assessment of the strength of 
the evidence (SOE) reflects the 
confidence that we have in the 
stability of treatment effects in the 
face of future research. The degree 
of confidence that the observed 
effect of an intervention is unlikely 
to change in additional research, 
the SOE, is presented as insufficient, 
low, moderate, or high. Assessments 
are based on consideration of study 
limitations, consistency in the 
direction of the effect, directness in 
measuring intended outcomes, the 
precision of the effect, and reporting 
bias.12 We determined the SOE 
separately for major intervention-
outcome pairs using a prespecified 
approach, which is described in detail 
in the full review.8
ResuLTs
Our searches (conducted for the 
broader systematic review update8) 
identified 6573 citations, of which 24 
(reported in multiple publications) 
met the inclusion criteria (Fig 1). 
Seventeen of these studies were 
published after the completion of 
our initial review of therapies for 
children with ASD,

outlines the study characteristics and 
risk of bias assessments.
We categorized interventions 
addressed in the included studies 
based on the core strategies used 
in each intervention. In some cases, 
this approach grouped together 
interventions that may have used 
specific, manualized techniques with 
others that used only a subset of 
those techniques (eg, “Ayres-based” 
sensory integration and sensory 
integration models that may have 
used some Ayres strategies). We note 
that no alternative approaches would 
have substantially changed our 
overall findings in terms of SOE.
Based on the literature meeting 
criteria for this review, we 
categorized interventions as:
 
• sensory integration-based 
(interventions using combinations 
of sensory and kinetic components, 
such as materials with different 
textures, touch/massage, swinging 
and trampoline exercises, and 
balance and muscle resistance 
exercises to ameliorate sensory 
challenges);
 
• environmental enrichment-based 
(interventions incorporating 
targeted exposure to sensory 
stimuli to promote tolerance of 
stimuli in other contexts);
 
• auditory integration-based 
(interventions incorporating 
auditory components, such as 
filtered sound to ameliorate 
sensory processing challenges 
via theorized retraining of aural 
pathways);

• music therapy-based 
(interventions incorporating 
playing or singing music, or 
movement to music, to improve 
challenging behaviors and sensory 
difficulties);
 
• massage-based (interventions 
incorporating touch-based 
approaches by a therapist or 
caregiver); and
 
• other/additional (included 
interventions [tactile-based tasks, 
weighted blankets] not cleanly 
fitting into one of the broader 
categories).
studies of sensory Integration-
based Approaches
In 3 out of 4 small, short-term 
studies (1 low, 
21 1 moderate, 
20 and 
2 high13, 
 
34 risk of bias), sensory-
related measures and motor skills 
measures improved for children 
receiving a sensory integration-
based intervention compared with 
another intervention, but effects on 
other outcomes were typically not 
statistically significantly different 
between groups (Table 3). Several 
outcomes were also parent-reported, 
and parents were often aware of 
intervention status.
In 1 RCT, children with ASD and 
a diagnosed sensory processing 
disorder received treatment focused 
on sensory integration or treatment 
focused on building fine motor 
skills.21 Both groups improved 
significantly on blinded parent and 
teacher ratings of goal attainment 
related to sensory processing, 
motor skills, and social functioning, 
with children receiving sensory 
integration improving significantly 
more than those receiving motor 
skills intervention (P ≤ .05). Children 
in the sensory integration group 
had significantly fewer parent-rated 
autistic mannerisms posttreatment 
than the fine motor group (P ≤ 
.05), but other measures of sensory 
processing, ASD symptoms, or 
neurologic functioning did not 
differ between groups. Another RCT 
compared manualized occupational 
therapy with sensory integration 
to care as usual.20 After treatment, 
children receiving sensory 
integration-based treatment showed 
significantly more goals attained and 
significantly greater improvements 
in social skills and self-care measures 
compared with children receiving 
usual care (P = .003). Measures of 
adaptive behavior or other measures 
related to functional skills (eg, self-
care and mobility) did not differ 
between groups.
In a retrospective study comparing 
sensory integration-based therapy 
in children with high functioning 
ASD (IQs >70), both groups received 
active treatment that included either 
sensory integration-based therapy or 
eclectic group therapy.34 Participants 
in the sensory integration group 
improved significantly more than 
those in the control group in 
measures of motor abilities, memory 
and visualization, and combined 
sensory motor and cognitive 
skills assessed by an unblinded 
investigator (P values < .05). They 
did not show relative improvements 
in measures of spatial positioning, 
sense of touch, or verbal ability.

 Finally, in an RCT evaluating the 
effects of a sensory integration-based 
protocol on low-functioning children 
with ASD, children receiving sensory 
integration-based intervention had 
significantly fewer parent-rated 
sensory problems at follow-up than 
children in the usual-care control 
group.13
studies of environmental 
enrichment-based Approaches
Two small RCTs (low23 and 
moderate22 risk of bias) of 
environmental enrichment examined 
the same protocol and reported 
improvements in ASD symptoms, 
receptive language, and nonverbal 
cognitive skills after 6 months of 
treatment (Table 3). Compared 
with usual care, children receiving 
environmental enrichment had 
a more significant decrease in 
clinician-rated ASD symptoms (P 
= .03) at the end of treatment in 1 
RCT, with nearly 5 times as many 
participants in the treatment group 
showing clinically significant drops of 
≥5 points (42% vs 7%, P = .03).22 The 
treatment group also had a 9-point 
increase in nonverbal cognitive 
skills compared with a decrease of 
∼3 points in the usual care group (P 
= .008). Both groups improved on 
expressive language skills, with no 
significant differences.
A second RCT built on the 
preliminary work by examining 
use of the same sensorimotor 
enrichment regimen over 6 months.23 
The treatment groups, which 
experienced significant attrition, 
showed more improvement than 
did the control group in receptive 
language skills, but both groups 
improved comparably for expressive 
language. The treatment group had 
significantly more improvement on 
mean nonverbal IQ scores as well 
as parent-rated sensory reactivity. 
Although more children in the 
treatment group compared with 
the control group shifted their 
diagnostic classification on the 
Autism Diagnostic Observation 
Schedule-2 from “autism” to “autism 
spectrum, 
” all children across both 
groups continued to meet the cut-
offs for ASD, making it difficult to 
interpret the clinical significance of 
the findings.
studies of Auditory Integration-
based Approaches
Two small, short-term RCTs 
of auditory integration-based 
approaches (moderate risk of bias) 
reported no significant differences 
between groups in language 
outcomes assessed on parent, 
teacher, and clinician observation 
measures.14, 
 
15 Two high risk of 
bias RCTs (reported in a single 
publication) reported significant 
parent-rated improvements in 
hearing sensitivity and behavior 
(Table 3).26 One crossover RCT 
comparing music passed through 
an electronic ear for attenuation 
and modulation to commercially 
produced music reported no 
statistically significant treatment 
effects on language skills.14 Another 
RCT of auditory integration therapy 
for children with significant language 
delays reported no significant 
benefits of auditory integration.15 
Two RCTs examined the use of 
filtered music and reported some 
parent-rated improvement in hearing 
sensitivity, spontaneous speech, 
listening, and behavioral organization 
after filtered music compared with 
children in the control condition (P 
≤ .05).26 Across both trials, groups 
did not differ in the other behavioral 
domains rated.
studies of Music Therapy-based 
Approaches
Five small studies (2 low, 
30 
– 
32 1 
moderate, 
25 and 2 high16, 
 
33 risk of 
bias) addressing music therapy-
based approaches reported some 
significant effects on measures 
of behavior (social engagement, 
behavioral organization), verbal 
and nonverbal communication, and 
joint attention (directing and sharing 
attention to objects or events) with 
music-based intervention compared 
with control interventions (Table 
3). Studies used different protocols 
and addressed different outcomes, 
and thus, drawing conclusions across 
studies is challenging.
One RCT (reported in 2 publications) 
compared a trainer-led rhythm and 
movement-based approach, a robot 
group focused on imitation, and a 
control group engaging in tabletop 
activities.31, 
 
32 Both rhythm and robot 
treatment groups demonstrated 
greater posttest attention to trainers 
than to objects than did the control 
group (P < .001), with greater 
attention in the rhythm group than 
the robot group (P < .001). The 
rhythm group also demonstrated the 
greatest duration of spontaneous 
social attention, followed by the 
robot group and the control group 
(P < .001). Children in the robot 
group had greater self-directed 
vocalization compared with the 
other groups (P < .002), whereas 
children in the rhythm and control 
groups had greater spontaneous 
social verbalization to trainers than 
did children in the robot group (P 
< .03). In another RCT, children 
who received family-centered 
music therapy plus early intensive 
intervention had more improvement 
than those receiving early intensive 
intervention alone in parent-rated 
social engagement (P < .001), but 
remained significantly impaired 
relative to typically developing 
peers.25 Groups did not differ on 
parent-reported autism symptoms, 
speech and language, or quality of the 
parent-child relationship.
In a crossover RCT comparing music 
therapy and toy play, investigators 
observed more joy, emotional 
synchronicity, and initiation of 
engagement during music therapy 
than in play sessions. In addition, 
children had significantly more 
compliant behavior and significantly 
fewer episodes of lack of response 
in the music therapy condition.16

 Finally, 2 studies evaluating different 
forms of music therapy compared 
with treatment as usual or no 
treatment reported no significant 
group differences in outcome 
measurements, including ASD 
symptom severity and social skills at 
follow-up.30,

studies of Massage
Studies compared either massage 
with no massage; massage plus 
sensory integration-based treatment 
versus sensory integration-based 
treatment alone; and massage 
plus attachment therapy versus 
attachment therapy alone (Table 
3). Almost all studies were from 
1 group of investigators, and the 
participant overlap is unclear. 
Studies comparing massage to 
no massage generally reported 
improvements related to sensory 
processing, autism symptoms, and 
parent stress in both treatment 
and control groups over the course 
of 5 months of either parent- or 
parent and therapist-delivered 
intervention, with treatment groups 
improving significantly more than 
controls. The difficulty differentiating 
populations in these studies limits 
the SOE for their findings, although 
results seem promising regarding a 
sensory-focused intervention that 
can be delivered within the home 
environment with minimal risk of 
harms.
Five studies17,

24, 
 
29, 
35 (3 moderate19, 
 
24, 
 
29 
and 2 high17, 
35 risk of bias) with 
unclear participant overlap 
compared children who received 
massage to wait-listed controls 
or those who received usual 
care. Children receiving massage 
improved significantly on parent 
ratings of autism symptoms as 
well as parent ratings of sensory 
challenges and self-regulation skills 
compared with children not receiving 
massage (P ≤ .05).17, 
 
19, 
 
24 Gains 
were maintained for 19 treatment 
group participants whose parents 
were available to provide data 5 
months posttreatment, but data were 
unavailable on other participants.17 
In a retrospective report, children 
receiving either parent-delivered 
or parent and therapist-delivered 
massage had greater improvements 
in tactile defensiveness, self-
regulation skills, and parent stress 
than did children not receiving 
massage (P < .001).35 In 1 report 
assessing parent and therapist-
delivered massage, post-hoc analyses 
revealed specific treatment effects 
on parent-rated, but not clinician-
rated, measures of autism symptoms, 
receptive (but not expressive) 
language, sensory processing, and 
parent stress improved more in the 
treatment group compared with 
the control group (P < .01). Group 
differences in social and daily living 
skills were not significant.29
One RCT (high risk of bias) 
comparing sensory integration-
based therapy compared with 
sensory integration-based therapy 
plus traditional Thai massage, 
parent-rated measures of anxiety 
and conduct improved in the 
massage group versus the control 
group (P ≤ .03).18 Children in both 
conditions had improved sleep as 
well as teacher ratings of conduct, 
attention, and activity level (P = NS). 
One retrospective cohort study (high 
risk of bias) investigating massage 
therapy with and without attachment 
therapy reported significant 
improvements in social maturity in 
the massage group compared with 
attachment therapy alone (P = .005), 
but measures of symptom severity 
did not differ significantly between 
groups.36
Additional studies
Other interventions with sensory-
related components reported limited 
differences between treatment 
groups (Table 3). One RCT (high 
risk of bias) examining the impact 
of a hands-on, tactile-based activity 
on the ability to learn a novel task 
reported greater perceived ease of 
learning for children in the hands-on 
participation group compared with 
children in the control, observation-
only condition immediately 
posttreatment (P values ≤ .05).28 In 
another RCT (moderate risk of bias), 
parents were more likely to rate 
their children as calmer and sleeping 
better when using a weighted 
blanket (P ≤ .04), despite a lack of 
physiologic evidence to support this 
(no significant group differences in 
actigraphy measures).27 Investigators 
reported that 1 child developed a 
rash that may have been due to the 
blanket (resolved in 2 days).

Table 4 outlines SOE ratings. 
Sensory-related and motor skill 
outcomes improved in children 
receiving a sensory integration-
based intervention compared with 
those receiving usual care or other 
treatment (significant improvements 
in 3 of 4 studies addressing the 
outcome). We have low confidence 
in these conclusions given the 
small sample sizes and short study 
durations (low SOE). Similarly, we 
have low confidence in the conclusion 
that environmental enrichment 
approaches improved nonverbal 
cognitive skills (low SOE). These 
enrichment approaches did not affect 
expressive language. We have low 
confidence in this conclusion (low 
SOE). We have low confidence in the 
conclusion that auditory integration-
based approaches do not improve 
language outcomes (low SOE).
Massage improved sensory 
challenges and ASD symptom 
severity compared with no massage. 
Our confidence in this conclusion 
is low (low SOE). Massage did not 
improve maladaptive behavior (low 
SOE). We could not make conclusions 
about other comparisons, including 
for music therapy or the effects of 
sensory or auditory integration-
based approaches or massage on 
other outcomes, given the lack of data 
(insufficient SOE).

We identified limited evidence 
for positive effects of sensory 
integration-based, environmental 
enrichment, and massage 
modalities. The lack of consistency 
in implementation combined 
with generally small sample sizes 
(median sample size = 34 total) and 
limited follow-up make it difficult to 
draw strong conclusions regarding 
treatment efficacy. Populations 
across studies were heterogeneous 
in terms of sensory challenges, ASD 
severity, age, and intellectual and 
adaptive functioning. Interventions, 
even within our broader categories, 
used differing sensory-specific 
approaches in differing combinations 
of components, settings, and 
duration, complicating our ability to 
draw conclusions across the body of 
literature. Longer-term outcomes are 
limited as is our ability to determine 
the effects of interventions on the 
underlying sensory challenges 
themselves. Potential harms of 
interventions were addressed in only 
1 study, and few studies assessed 
factors that may modify effectiveness 
or drive the effects of interventions. 
Studies often used multicomponent 
strategies, and teasing apart the 
effects of specific components is not 
currently possible. These limitations 
in the evidence underscore the 
need for caregivers and referring 
providers to assess the possible 
benefits of specific sensory-focused 
intervention modalities based on the 
individual needs of the child, broader 
family goals and capacities, and 
interventions of more established 
effectiveness. In this capacity, some 
practice groups have recommended 
clear communication regarding the 
limits of intervention.37, 
 
38
Despite these limitations, 
investigators have made significant 
improvements in incorporating 
commonly used measures of 
symptom severity, behavior, 
language, and sensory difficulties 
to facilitate comparisons across

We could not make conclusions about effects of music therapy, a tactile-based task, and weighted blankets given the number of studies addressing each intervention or outcome (insufficient SOE). We also could not make conclusions about other 
outcomes reported in studies of sensory integration-based approaches, auditory integration-based approaches, environmental enrichment, or massage given differences in outcome reporting (insufficient SOE).

 studies. Parent-reported outcomes 
are necessary in this population 
of children, many of whom may 
not be able to complete aspects 
of assessments; however, studies 
are increasingly incorporating 
standardized interactive or 
observational measurement 
strategies. Moreover, an increasing 
use of treatment fidelity measures 
and replicable intervention protocols 
establishes a promising baseline for 
future investigations. Investigators 
in the area are also well aware of the 
challenges of conducting research 
using a disparate and variously 
defined set of approaches in a highly 
heterogeneous population and 
have made strides in incorporating 
outcome measures that attempt 
to balance heterogeneity and 
comparative effectiveness and 
measures of intervention fidelity.39
Our findings generally align  
with recent previous reviews  
of sensory-focused  
interventions.6, 
 
40 
– 
49 Previous reviews 
typically noted low to moderate 
support for sensory integration-
based approaches and limited 
evidence for other approaches. 
Reviews differentiating sensory 
integration approaches and more 
general “sensory-based” approaches 
reported better evidence from those 
studies that evaluated specific, 
typically manualized, sensory 
integration modalities compared 
with sensory-based approaches.3, 
 
47 
One review of auditory integration 
approaches reported no evidence of 
effectiveness.41 One review of music 
therapy reported promising findings 
related to improvements in social 
interaction and communication, 
50 
and 1 review addressing massage 
reported that limited evidence 
precluded conclusions.40 Previous 
reviews also consistently noted 
considerable heterogeneity, limited 
study quality/high risk of bias, 
limited follow-up, and lack of 
treatment fidelity.
Limitations of the Review
We included studies published in 
English only and did not include gray 
literature. Based on a scan of non-
English publications, we concluded 
that excluding non-English studies 
would not introduce significant bias 
into the review, and previous studies 
have noted limited bias from such 
exclusion.51 
– 
53 We also included only 
comparative studies of interventions 
with a sensory-specific focus and 
that included at least 10 children 
with ASD, and this undoubtedly 
means that most single-subject 
design studies were not included 
in this review. Single-subject 
designs can be helpful in assessing 
response to treatment in short time 
frames and under tightly controlled 
circumstances, but they typically do 
not provide information on longer-
term or functional outcomes.
As noted, other approaches to 
categorizing sensory-focused 
interventions could also be used, 
and widespread consensus on a 
categorization approach is lacking. 
This review was also focused 
specifically on children with ASD 
and only on interventions targeting 
sensory challenges. Sensory 
approaches may be used with 
individuals with other diagnoses, 
and findings may be generalizable 
to children with ASD. However, 
including studies of children with 
other conditions was beyond our 
scope, as was inclusion of any 
intervention approach (eg, primarily 
behavioral or educational) reporting 
a sensory-related outcome. Finally, 
we used a nonvalidated tool to 
assess risk of bias, although the tool 
evaluates similar constructs to those 
assessed by tools such as that used by 
the Cochrane Collaboration, with the 
addition of ASD-specific domains.
Areas for Future Research
Several adjustments to study design 
would strengthen our ability to draw 
conclusions from future work. Many 
sample sizes were small, limiting 
their power to detect effects. Duration 
of treatment and follow-up were 
generally short, and the extent to 
which the effects of therapies could be 
expected to continue after cessation of 
treatment is not clear. Although some 
approaches may not hypothesize such 
durability, such data are nevertheless 
necessary for guiding pragmatic 
implementation and setting realistic 
expectations of effects for clinicians 
and families. In addition, few studies 
adequately accounted for concomitant 
interventions that might confound 
observed effectiveness.
Compared with our previous review, 
more studies used a common set of 
outcome measures. The extent to 
which these measures assess changes 
in potential underlying sensory-
related impairments remains 
unclear, and understanding whether 
intervention can alter underlying 
vulnerabilities rather than short-
term behavioral responses is a 
critical need. Translational work 
to understand the relationship 
between sensory symptoms and their 
potential neurobiology would inform 
intervention design.
It will be important for future 
work to compare sensory-
based interventions not only to 
treatment as usual, but also to other 
interventions that involve engaged 
and active time with an adult, as  
did some studies in the current 
review.21, 
 
23, 
 
36 Additional research 
is needed that controls for 
environmental or social factors 
that could cloud our ability to draw 
conclusions regarding effects. It 
will be important to identify which 
children are likely to benefit from 
particular interventions. To date, 
studies have provided limited 
characterization of treatment 
responders as well as the extent or 
type of sensory challenges children 
experience at baseline. Interventions 
targeting sensory challenges by 
their nature often employ multiple 
components, but our understanding 
of which components may drive

 effectiveness is lacking. Component 
analyses in this field would be 
productive for refining intervention 
approaches and for assessing the 
generalizability of results.
concLusIons
In sum, some interventions targeting 
sensory challenges may yield modest 
improvements, primarily in sensory- 
and ASD symptom severity-related 
outcomes. However, the evidence base 
for any category of intervention is 
small, and the durability of the effects 
beyond the immediate intervention 
period is unclear. Sensory integration-
based approaches improved outcomes 
related to sensory challenges and 
motor skills, and studies of massage 
reported improvements in sensory 
responses and ASD symptoms. 
Environmental enrichment was also 
associated with improvements in 
nonverbal cognitive skills in the short 
term. Auditory integration-based 
approaches did not improve language 
outcomes. Some positive effects were 
associated with other approaches 
studied (music therapy, weighted 
blankets), but findings in these small 
studies were not consistent. Data 
on longer-term results are lacking. 
Although some therapies may hold 
promise and warrant additional study, 
substantial needs exist for continuing 
improvements in methodologic rigor 
in the field.
