IMPORTANCE Sleep apnea (obstructive and central) is associated with adverse cardiovascular
risk factors and increased risks of cardiovascular disease. Positive airway pressure (PAP)
provides symptomatic relief, whether delivered continuously (CPAP) or as adaptive
servo-ventilation (ASV), but the associations with cardiovascular outcomes and death are
unclear.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association of PAP vs control with cardiovascular events and death
in patients with sleep apnea.
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were
systematically searched from inception date to March 2017 for randomized clinical trials that
included reporting of major adverse cardiovascular events or deaths.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two authors independently extracted data using
standardized forms. Summary relative risks (RRs), risk differences (RDs) and 95% CIs were
obtained using random-effects meta-analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcomes were a composite of acute coronary
syndrome (ACS) events, stroke, or vascular death (major adverse cardiovascular events);
cause-specific vascular events; and death.
RESULTS The analyses included data from 10 trials (9 CPAP; 1 ASV) of patients with sleep
apnea (N = 7266; mean age, 60.9 [range, 51.5 to 71.1] years; 5847 [80.5%] men; mean [SD]
body mass index, 30.0 [5.2]. Among 356 major adverse cardiovascular events and 613 deaths
recorded, there was no significant association of PAP with major adverse cardiovascular
events (RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.53 to 1.13]; P = .19 and RD, −0.01 [95% CI, −0.03 to 0.01]; P = .23),
cardiovascular death (RR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.50]; P = .30 and RD −0.00 [95% CI, −0.02 to
0.02]; P = .87), or all-cause death (RR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.29]; P = .08 and RD, 0.00 [95%
CI, −0.01 to 0.01]; P = .51). The same was true for ACS, stroke, and heart failure. There was no
evidence of different associations for CPAP vs ASV (all P value homogeneity >.24), and
meta-regressions identified no associations of PAP with outcomes for different levels of
apnea severity, follow-up duration, or adherence to PAP (all P values > .13).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The use of PAP, compared with no treatment or sham, was
not associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular outcomes or death for patients with sleep
apnea. Although there are other benefits of treatment with PAP for sleep apnea, these
findings do not support treatment with PAP with a goal of prevention of these outcomes.

leepapneaischaracterizedbyrepetitiveepisodesofshal-
low breathing or apnea during sleep. Sleep apnea can re-
sult in episodic hypoxemia and is associated with el-
evated blood pressure, oxidative stress, inflammation, and
hypercoagulation.1-3 Observational studies indicate sleep ap-
nea is associated with elevated risk of serious cardiovascular
events, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke,
and sudden death.4
Positive airway pressure (PAP) is an established treat-
ment for the symptoms of sleep apnea5 and has been re-
ported to lead to modest decreases in blood pressure among
affected patients.6,7 The 2014 American Heart Association/
American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines8 for
the use of PAP advise that
treatment should be con-
sidered for patients with
acute ischemic stroke or
transient ischemic attack.
Several trials9-11 have re-
ported the associations of
PAP with cardiovascular
outcomes, but individual
trial results have been imprecise, and there remains uncer-
tainty about the associations of PAP with vascular disease and
death. Although prior meta-analyses6,7 exist, none included
the large Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints (SAVE) trial,
which adds substantive new data and insights into the likely
effects of PAP on major clinical outcomes. The purpose of this
systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the asso-
ciation of PAP with cardiovascular events and death in adults
with sleep apnea.
Methods
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
A systematic search of the scientific literature was done
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement for the
conduct of meta-analyses of intervention studies.12 The
searches included MEDLINE via Ovid (from January 1, 1946,
to March 2017), EMBASE (from January 1, 1974, to March
2017), and the Cochrane Library database (Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials, no date restriction) using rel-
evant text words and Medical Subject Headings that con-
sisted of terms relating to randomized trial and sleep apnea
(see the eAppendix in the Supplement for detailed search
strategy). The search was limited to randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) but without language restriction. Additionally, refer-
ence lists from trials, review articles, and reports were manu-
ally scanned to identify any other relevant data (including
conference abstracts). The clinicaltrials.gov website was
searched for RCTs that were registered as completed but not
yet published.
Trial Inclusion Criteria
All RCTs assessing the association of PAP compared with
standard care (or sham PAP) among adults (aged ≥18 years)
with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or central sleep apnea
(CSA) were potentially eligible for inclusion. Duplicate
reports, trials that lasted 12 weeks or less, trials with less
than 100 patient-years of follow-up per randomized group,
and trials that did not report on outcomes of interest (cardio-
vascular events or death) were excluded. We also excluded
scientific reports that presented pooled trial data for which
the individual trials could not be identified to prevent
double counting.
Study Selection and Data Extraction
The review of potentially eligible scientific reports identi-
fied by the searches was completed by 2 authors (J.Y. and
Z.Z.) to identify reports for review in full text. Each full-text
article was then reviewed for eligibility by these authors
and, for each included study, data were extracted indepen-
dently and in duplicate using a standardized electronic
form. Any disagreement in extracted data was settled by
consultation. Data sought were the first author, year of pub-
lication, country where the study was conducted, number
of participants, percent of male participants, mean age of
participants, inclusion criteria for OSA or CSA, intervention
type, participant adherence, follow-up duration, cardiovas-
cular events, and deaths (including cardiovascular death,
noncardiovascular death, and all-cause death).
Two investigators (J.Y. and Z.Z.) also judged the quality of
each included trial according to the Cochrane Collaboration’
s
tool for assessing risk of bias. There were 7 quality items
assessed: (1) random sequence generation, (2) allocation
sequence concealment, (3) blinding of participants and per-
sonnel, (4) blinding of outcome assessment, (5) completeness
of outcome data, (6) selective reporting, and (7) other
sources of bias, which were each classified as low, unclear,
or high.13
Outcomes
The composite outcomes of interest were major adverse car-
diovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal acute
coronary syndrome [ACS], and nonfatal stroke) and major
adverse cardiovascular events with hospitalization for
unstable angina.
ACS acute coronary syndrome
ASV adaptive servo-ventilation
CPAP continuous positive airway
pressure
CSA central sleep apnea
OSA obstructive sleep apnea
PAP positive airway pressure
Key Points
Question Does the use of positive airway pressure (PAP) to treat
sleep apnea reduce risk of cardiovascular events and death?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 10 randomized clinical
trials including 7266 patients, there was no significant association
of PAP compared with no treatment (or sham PAP) on
a composite outcome of acute coronary syndrome events,
stroke, or vascular death (relative risk, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.53-1.13]).
There was also no significant association with individual outcomes
or all-cause death.
Meaning Although there are other benefits of PAP use for
treating sleep apnea, these findings do not support treatment
with a goal of preventing cardiovascular outcomes or
improving survival.

 The cause-specific outcomes were fatal or nonfatal
ACS, fatal or nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable
angina, and fatal or hospitalized heart failure. All-cause
death, cardiovascular death, and noncardiovascular death
were also studied.
Some studies reported intermediate outcomes: systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI; calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared), blood lipids (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and tri-
glycerides), fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c, and
scores from the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Sleep Apnea
Quality of Life Index (SAQLI), European Quality of Life-5
Dimensions (EQ-5D), the 36-item Short-Form (SF-36), and the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
Analysis
The numbers of dichotomous outcomes were summarized
and mean values with standard deviations were collated for
continuous outcomes. Summary relative risks (RRs) and
risk differences (RDs) with 95% CIs were estimated for pri-
mary and secondary outcomes using the DerSimonian and
Laird random-effects model.14 For continuous parameters,
weighted mean differences were calculated using end-of-trial
mean (SD) values and treatment group size. A 2-sided P value
of less than or equal to .05 was deemed significant. The per-
centage of variability across the pooled estimates attributable
to heterogeneity beyond chance was estimated using the
I2 statistic13 and by calculating the P value for heterogeneity.
An I2 statistic13 was considered to reflect low likelihood
(0%-25%), moderate likelihood (26%-75%), and high likeli-
hood (76%-100%) of differences beyond chance, as was
a P value of less than or equal to .05 for heterogeneity.15
Where there was a moderate or high likelihood of differences
beyond chance, sensitivity analyses were done excluding
individual studies to try and obtain an understanding of the
reasons for the differences. Random-effects meta-regression
analyses were used to investigate the associations of length
of follow-up, adherence to randomized treatment, and
apnea-hypopnea index with the observed RR for each trial.
Subgroup analyses were done by grouping trials according to
adherence to PAP (<4 vs ≥4 h/d), type of sleep apnea (OSA
vs CSA), type of intervention (CPAP vs ASV), and whether
vascular outcomes or death were prespecified outcomes. Evi-
dence of publication bias was sought using the Egger regres-
sion test for funnel asymmetry in addition to visual inspec-
tion of the funnel plots. Statistical analyses were performed
with Stata, version 12.0.
Results
Search Results and Characteristics of Included Studies
The literature search yielded 5765 articles of which 103 were
reviewed in full text (Figure 1). Of these, 10 RCTs (7266 pa-
tients [5683 OSA; 1583 CSA]) met inclusion criteria.16-25 Among
these patients, 356 major adverse cardiovascular events, 635
major adverse cardiovascular events with hospitalization for
unstable angina, and 613 deaths were reported. The majority
of other studies identified by our search had less than 12 weeks
of follow-up26 or less than 100 patient-years of follow-up per
randomized group27,28 or did not report on the clinical out-
comes of interest.29,30
All trial results17-25 were published during or after 2010
except 1 trial16 in 2005 (Table 1). All studies16-21,23,24 except
2 were multicenter trials.22,25 Studies assessed the associa-
tion of PAP (9 CPAP16-20,22-25 and 1 ASV21) with standard care
(9 studies16-18,20-25) or sham PAP (1 study19). Sample size
ranged from 83 participants22 to 2717 participants24 (median
follow-up range, 6 months18,19 to 68 months23). Diagnosis of
sleep apnea was based on conventional polysomnographic or
polygraphic monitoring in all but 1 trial that used a home
sleep study.24 Mean or median adherence to the intervention
ranged between 1.4 hours per day20 and 6.6 hours per day.25
The assessments of risk of bias (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment) showed that only 1 trial19 included blinding of partici-
pants and personnel to the intervention, but all except 1 did
blindedassessmentofcardiovascularoutcomes.23Funnelplots

Association of PAP With Cardiovascular Outcomes and Death
There were no associations of PAP with major adverse cardio-
vascular events (RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.53 to 1.13; P = .19] and
RD, −0.01 [95% CI, −0.03 to 0.01; P = .23]), major adverse car-
diovascular events plus hospitalization for unstable angina
(RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.71 to 1.20; P = .54] and RD, −0.01 [95%
CI, −0.03 to 0.01; P = .42]), cardiovascular death (RR, 1.15
[95% CI, 0.88 to 1.50; P = .30] and RD, −0.00 [95% CI, −0.02
to 0.02; P = .87]), all-cause death (RR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.99 to
1.29; P = .08] and RD, 0.00 [95% CI, −0.01 to 0.01; P = .51]),
or noncardiovascular death (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.19;
P = .33] and RD, −0.00 [95% CI, −0.01 to 0.01; P = .51])
(Figure 2 and eTable 1 in the Supplement). Additionally, there
were no associations of PAP with cause-specific outcomes of
ACS (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.65 to 1.55; P = .99] and RD, −0.00
[95% CI, −0.02 to 0.01; P = .45]), stroke (RR, 0.90 [95% CI,
0.66 to 1.21; P = .47] and RD, −0.00 [95% CI, −0.02 to 0.01;
P = .52]), hospitalization for unstable angina (RR, 1.15 [95%
CI, 0.89 to 1.49; P = .29] and RD, 0.01 [95% CI, −0.01 to 0.03;
P = .21]) or heart failure (RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.16;
P = .60] and RD, −0.00 [95% CI, −0.01 to 0.01; P = .87])
(Figure 3 and eTable 1 in the Supplement). The meta-
regression analyses identified no association between the
length of follow-up, adherence to PAP, baseline apnea-
hypopnea index, and the relative risks of events reported for
the individual trials (Figure 4; eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the

 for cardiovascular death (P = .45), all-cause death (P = .33), or
noncardiovascular death (P = .73) (Figure 5). There were no
subgroup analyses that showed clear evidence of heteroge-
neity between subgroups of studies (all P values for homoge-
neity were >.09), but the summary RR for the 4 trials that
achieved at least 4 hours of adherence did have a 95% CI that
just excluded unity (RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.99]).
Association of PAP With Intermediate Outcomes
Data describing the associations of PAP with intermediate out-
comes were diverse and inconsistently described. Compa-
rable data reported by more than 1 study ranged in quantity
from sleepiness reported by 5 studies17,19,20,22,24 (n = 4285 par-
ticipants) to total cholesterol reported by just 2 studies18,20
(n = 527 participants) (Table 2). For the included studies, there
was no association of treatment with PAP detected for blood
pressure, BMI, any lipid parameter, glycemia, or EQ-5D, but as-
sociations were observed for sleepiness and a range of mea-
sures of physical and mental well-being. For several of these
intermediate measures, there was evidence of differences in
theassociationwithPAPacrossthecontributingtrials(Table2).
Discussion
In this meta-analysis of RCTs, there were no significant asso-
ciations between PAP treatment and a range of cardiovascular
events or death, although anticipated associations with some
other outcomes related to sleep apnea were observed.7,32-35
Based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to recom-
mend PAP therapy for the improvement of symptoms in pa-
tients with OSA but not for protection against vascular disease
or death. It is possible that an enhanced evidence base able to
better explore effects in patient subgroups might identify pro-
tectiveeffectsofPAPtreatmentforsomepatientsubsets.Inthe
meantime, these data emphasize the importance of proven
therapies, such as blood pressure lowering, lipid lowering, and
antiplatelet therapy in patients with sleep apnea, who should
be treated according to established guidelines for patients at
elevated cardiovascular risk.36-38
Sleep apnea is highly prevalent39-43 and is associated with
an elevated risk of serious vascular outcomes4 and multiple
risk factors including hypertension,1,44,45 obesity,46,47 insulin

although improvements in glycemic control49 and BMI have

of sleep apnea with vascular risk and the apparent beneficial
effectsofPAPonintermediatebiomarkersprovidedarationale
for expecting that adequately powered trials of PAP would
show beneficial effects on hard vascular outcomes.
There have been several reasons postulated for the fail-
ure of PAP trials to demonstrate protection against vascular
outcomes. It is possible that the limited adherence to therapy
in many trials was insufficient to drive protection, and there
have been several reports of differential benefits of PAP in
more vs less adherent patients derived from post hoc
analyses.17,25 A weakness of these reports is that analyses
based on nonrandomized comparisons may reflect con-
founding due to differences between adherent and nonad-
herent individuals rather than their use of PAP. The method-
ologically more robust meta-regression approach reported
herein identified no association of adherence with the effec-
tiveness of PAP for prevention of vascular disease, although
statistical power to detect modest effects was low. Likewise,
there was no heterogeneity detected between the associa-
tions observed in subgroups of trials that achieve adherence
less than 4 vs 4 or more hours per night. The statistically sig-
nificant benefit (RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.99]) observed for
the major adverse cardiovascular events outcome in trials
with at least 4 hours per night may be interpreted as indicat-
ing the importance of good adherence to achieving benefits
with PAP. However, the absence of any comparable associa-
tion for other outcomes, the post hoc nature of the subgroup
analyses, and the multiple comparisons made also make
chance a plausible explanation. The short follow-up duration
of most trials may have given insufficient time for PAP to
have affected vascular outcomes,23 although the meta-
regression identified no association between follow-up time
and the hazard ratio for PAP vs control in the contributing
trials. It has been suggested that PAP may be ineffective in
patients with advanced disease, but this has not been
observed for other interventions targeting vascular condi-
tions in which treatments have typically proven effective in
primary and secondary prevention settings.53-57
The absence of any significant association of PAP with
intermediate markers of vascular risk in the trials included in
this overview may explain the null associations of PAP with
hard vascular outcomes. The disparity with earlier reports
of protection for several intermediate markers of vascular
risk6,7,49,52,58 might reflect the small and inconsistently re-
ported benefits in the prior studies and interpretation influ-
enced by publication bias. It is also possible that differences
in the characteristics of participants included in the present
systematic review and meta-analysis, compared with prior
studies, may account for the discrepancies, and this warrants
further investigation.
ThepositiveassociationofPAPobservedwiththeEpworth
Sleepiness Scale (reported previously)28 provides reassur-
ance that PAP was delivered with sufficient integrity, in these

 included trials, to deliver anticipated benefits. This overview
alsoshowsbeneficialeffectsonanxiety,depression,andphysi-
cal function (previously reported in the individual studies).
These benefits are of importance to patients and support the
use of PAP for treating sleep apnea even in the absence of evi-
dence of vascular protection. Further investigation of the ef-
fects of PAP on these outcomes is warranted.
The inclusion of 2 trials of patients with predominantly
central sleep apnea helped to increase statistical power to ad-
dress questions about the associations of PAP treatment with
outcomes, while concurrently enabling formal investigation
for evidence of different associations of PAP treatment in pa-
tients with different types of sleep apnea. The absence of evi-
dence of heterogeneity of the associations between PAP treat-
ment and outcomes across the obstructive sleep apnea and
central sleep apnea subgroups, along with the absence of a sig-
nificant association within either subgroup, strengthens the
primary conclusion of no effect.
This study has several limitations. First, the summary data
represent the available evidence from moderate-to-large-
sized RCTs able to describe the association of PAP with vas-
cular outcomes and death, but there are still relatively few
events recorded. Most outcome events derived from a small
number of studies, and many were from high-risk patient sub-
sets. It is possible that more data might reveal moderate ben-
efits of PAP that were beyond the power of this overview to
detect, although the absence of improvement in intermedi-
ate risk markers makes this a low likelihood.
The second limitation, conversely, is that it is possible that
additional data might reveal adverse effects since point esti-
mates of the associations of PAP with vascular death and all-
cause death were suggestive of harm rather than benefit.
Third, the participants in the contributing trials were
mostly those without excessive sleepiness, and it may be that
effects of PAP on vascular outcomes are restricted to patients
with more severe symptomatology. However, it is difficult to
envisage how this hypothesis could be tested in a trial be-
cause PAP treatment is indicated for most individuals with
more severe symptomatology, and randomization to a con-
trol group would not be feasible.
An ongoing trial of CPAP following ACS (NCT01335087)
and one of ASV in patients with heart failure (NCT01128816)
will provide additional insight, but the practical complexity
and cost associated with conducting PAP trials make it
unlikely that substantial additional data will be forthcoming
in the near future. If a new and very well-tolerated method of

 delivering PAP becomes available, this may be worth evaluat-
ing in another large trial since it remains possible that strong
adherence may produce benefits. In the meantime, the evi-
dence from these RCTs suggests that the association of sleep
apnea with vascular outcomes and death, seen in observa-
tional studies, may represent disease processes that cannot
be ameliorated by PAP delivered at the average intensity
achieved in these clinical trials or by currently feasible meth-
ods in clinical practice.
Conclusions
The use of PAP compared with no treatment or sham was not
associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular outcomes or
death for patients with sleep apnea. Although there are other
benefits of treatment with PAP for sleep apnea, these find-
ings do not support treatment with PAP with a goal of preven-
tion of these outcomes.
