IMPORTANCE Intermittent claudication (IC) is the most common presentation of infrainguinal
peripheral artery disease. Both medical and revascularization interventions for IC aim to
increase walking comfort and distance, but there is inconclusive evidence of the comparative
benefit of revascularization given the possible risk of limb loss.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of a medical (walking program, smoking cessation
counseling, and medications) vs revascularization (endovascular or surgical) intervention for
IC in the community, focusing on outcomes of greatest importance to patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Longitudinal (12-month follow-up) prospective
observational cohort study conducted between July 3, 2011, and November 5, 2014, at 15
clinics associated with 11 hospitals in Washington State. Participants were 21 years or older
with newly diagnosed or established IC.
INTERVENTIONS Medical or revascularization interventions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary end points were 12-month change scores on the
distance, speed, and stair-climb domains of the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (score
range, 0-100). Secondary outcomes were change scores on the Walking Impairment
Questionnaire pain domain (score range, 0-100), Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire
(VascuQol) (score range, 1-7), European Quality of Life–5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D)
(score range, 0-1), and Claudication Symptom Instrument (CSI) (score range, 0-4).
RESULTS A total of 323 adults were enrolled, with 282 (87.3%) in the medical cohort. At
baseline, the mean duration of disease was longer for participants in the medical cohort,
while those in the revascularization cohort reported more severe disease. Other
characteristics were well balanced. At 12 months, change scores in the medical cohort
reached significance for the following 3 outcomes: speed (5.9; 95% CI, 0.5-11.3; P = .03),
VascuQol (0.28; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49; P = .008), and EQ-5D (0.038; 95% CI, 0.011-0.066;
P = .006). In the revascularization cohort, there were significant improvements in the
following 7 outcomes: distance (19.5; 95% CI, 7.9-31.0; P = .001), speed (12.1; 95% CI,
1.4-22.8; P = .03), stair climb (11.4; 95% CI, 1.3-21.5; P = .03), pain (20.7; 95% CI, 11.0-30.4;
P < .001), VascuQol (1.10; 95% CI, 0.80-1.41; P < .001), EQ-5D (0.113; 95% CI, 0.067-0.159;
P < .001), and CSI (−0.63; 95% CI, −0.96 to −0.31; P < .001). Relative improvements
(percentage changes) at 12 months in the revascularization cohort over the medical cohort
were observed as follows: distance (39.1%), speed (15.6%), stair climb (9.7%), pain (116.9%),
VascuQol (41%), EQ-5D (18%), and CSI (13.5%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with IC, those in the revascularization cohort
had significantly improved function (Walking Impairment Questionnaire), better
health-related quality of life (VascuQol and EQ-5D), and fewer symptoms (CSI) at 12 months
compared with those in the medical cohort, providing important information to inform
treatment strategies in the community.

A
therosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) af-
fects 8 million Americans.1,2 Intermittent claudica-
tion (IC), the most common presentation of infraingui-
nal PAD, manifests as pain in the calf or foot with walking and
is present in more than 8 million people worldwide.3
Medical management addresses modifiable risk factors,
such as obesity, 4 diabetes, 5 hypertension, 5 and
dyslipidemia.2,5,6 Management includes a regular walking
program,7smokingcessation,8andmedications.9,10TheAmeri-
canCollegeofCardiologyandAmericanHeartAssociation11rec-
ommend a supervised walking program and medications for
all patients with PAD, but because claudication seldom pro-
gresses to limb loss, endovascular or surgical revasculariza-
tion is indicated only for those with the most severe symp-
toms. Despite these recommendations, with the widespread
availability of specialists trained in endovascular proce-
dures, the use of revascularization for patients with moder-
ate to severe claudication appears to be increasing.11 Further-
more, decisions about medical management have not been
standardized, resulting in wide practice variation.12,13
In this era of patient-centered care, it is important that cli-
niciansidentifywhatmattersmosttopatients,incorporatesuch
metrics into comparative evaluations of treatment effective-
ness, and involve them in shared decision making.14 Increas-
ingly,patient-reportedoutcomes(PROs)thatincorporatefunc-
tional status, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and
symptom burden are used to incorporate the patient’
s voice.15
Although randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the crite-
rion standard for evaluating safety and efficacy, their con-
duct is not always feasible. In these instances, population-
level comparative effectiveness research using observational
data provides information about the way treatments work in
the community. Comparative effectiveness research studies
enable identification of important variations that may inform
treatment strategies.16 However, observational comparative
effectiveness research studies must account for potential con-
founding bias that is inherently minimized in RCTs. This
issue may be somewhat mitigated when important character-
istics are incorporated into the study design. This study con-
ducted by the Comparative Effectiveness Research Transla-
tion Network (CERTAIN) Collaborative17,18 in Washington State
compared the effectiveness of a medical vs revascularization
intervention for IC in the community and focused on patient-
centered outcomes.
Methods
This multisite longitudinal (12-month follow-up) prospective
observational cohort study was conducted at 15 clinics asso-
ciated with 11 hospitals in Washington State. The University
of Washington Human Subjects Committee served as the
study’
s institutional review board of record and approved the
study. Preliminary consent was obtained via a scripted tele-
phoneconversation.Thiswasfollowedbycompletionofawrit-
ten consent form and Health Insurance Portability and Ac-
countability form, both of which were returned to the study
coordinator via US mail. All study data were deidentified. The
study examined the comparative effectiveness of the follow-
ing 3 treatment strategies for infrainguinal IC: medical man-
agement (physician-recommended walking program, smok-
ing cessation, and phosphodiesterase III inhibitors) vs
endovascular or surgical revascularization. We compared the
change from baseline to 6- and 12-month physical function,
HRQoL, and symptom scores using PRO measures. The pri-
mary outcomes were scores on the following 3 domains of the
modified Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ): dis-
tance, speed, and stair climb.19,20 Secondary outcomes were
scores on the WIQ pain domain, Vascular Quality of Life Ques-
tionnaire (VascuQoL),21 European Quality of Life–5 Dimen-
sion Questionnaire (EQ-5D),22 and Claudication Symptom In-
strument(CSI)(aclaudication-specificmeasuredevelopedand
validated for use in this study).
This study population consisted of English-speaking pa-
tients 21 years or older with newly diagnosed or established
IC. Those with acute ischemia, rest pain or ulceration, or iso-
lated aortic or iliac claudication were excluded. Potential par-
ticipants were identified from clinician appointment sched-
ules, followed by review of electronic medical records. Once
the diagnosis was confirmed, recruitment and enrollment ad-
hered to standard protocols. After participants completed a
baseline survey, they were categorized into 1 of the following
3 cohorts: medical management, endovascular revasculariza-
tion, or surgical revascularization. Patient-reported out-
comesweremeasuredbyself-reportatbaseline,6months,and
12 months. Data were collected using a secure web-based plat-
form (DatStat; DatStat Inc). Patient characteristics (demo-
graphicinformation,insurance,riskfactors,comorbidities,cur-
rent medications, surgical history, claudication severity,
duration of disease before enrollment, and ankle brachial in-
dex) were obtained at baseline through medical record ab-
straction or self-report. Study data were managed using re-
search electronic data capture.23
The modified WIQ is a disease- and function-specific mea-
sure of a patient’
s walking ability and has been validated in pa-
tients with IC.20 It contains 16 questions across the following
Key Points
Question What is the comparative effectiveness of
revascularization procedures vs medical management on function,
health-related quality of life, and symptoms in patients with
intermittent claudication?
Findings In this longitudinal prospective observational cohort
study that included 323 adults, relative improvements (percentage
changes) at 12 months in the following 5 outcomes in the
revascularization cohort were significantly improved over the
medical cohort: walking distance (39.1%), pain (116.9%), Vascular
Quality of Life Questionnaire (41.0%), European Quality of Life–5
Dimension Questionnaire (18.0%), and Claudication Symptom
Instrument (13.5%).
Meaning Adults with intermittent claudication in the
revascularization cohort had significantly improved function,
better health-related quality of life, and fewer symptoms at 12
months compared with those in the medical cohort, providing
important information to inform treatment strategies in the
community.

4 domains: pain in calves or buttocks (2 items), walking dis-
tance (7 items), walking speed (4 items), and stair climb (3
items). For distance, the participant is asked to rate the de-
gree of difficulty in walking distances ranging from walking
indoors to walking 1500 ft (457.2 m or 5 blocks). For speed, the
participant is asked to rate the degree of difficulty in walking
1 block, with speeds ranging from slow to jogging. For stair
climb, the participant is asked to rate the degree of difficulty
in climbing 1 to 3 flights of stairs. A standardized percentage
score ranging from 0 (inability) to 100 (no difficulty) is calcu-
lated for each domain. A total score is not calculated for the
modified WIQ.24 Improvements in WIQ scores have been
shown to be correlated with supervised exercise programs25
and lower extremity revascularization,26 although there is no
well-established minimally important difference (MID) for the
modified WIQ.
The 25-item VascuQoL is a validated measure that reli-
ably measures the effect of PAD across the following 5 do-
mains: pain (4 items), symptoms (4 items), activities (8 items),
social (2 items), and emotional (7 items).21,27,28 Each domain
is scored using an ordered 7-point response scale, and overall
(total) scores range from 1 (worst HRQoL) to 7 (best HRQoL).
The VascuQoL has been shown to correlate closely with out-
door walking capacity in IC.29 Minimally important differ-
ences for use with the VascuQoL in IC have recently been es-
timated to be 0.87 for improvement and 0.23 for
deterioration.30
The 3-level EQ-5D is a validated, generic, preference-
based HRQoL assessment that quantifies overall health and is
a reliable outcome measure for use in cardiovascular
medicine.31 It is composed of 1 question in each of the follow-
ing 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or dis-
comfort, and anxiety or depression. The 3 levels of scoring are
no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. An al-
gorithmtransformsthesescorestobetween0(death)and1(full
health).32 The MID is 0.074 for the EQ-5D.33 The EQ-5D is use-
ful in both clinical and economic evaluations.
The CSI is a claudication-specific measure created for use
inthisstudy.Itconsistsofthefollowing5itemsthatassessclau-
dication symptoms in the leg or foot: pain, numbness, heavi-
ness, cramping, and tingling. Each item is rated on an or-
dered5-pointintensityscalefortheworstintensityexperienced
inthepast7days(rangingfrom0[none]to4[extreme]).Atotal
score is calculated as the mean intensity of the 5 symptoms.
The primary a priori alternative hypothesis stated that, af-
ter controlling for traditional risk factors for IC, the mean de-
cline in function at 12 months on each of 3 domains of the WIQ
(distance, speed, and stair climb) would be greater in the medi-
cal cohort than in the endovascular and surgical cohorts com-
bined.Withananticipatedenrollmentof450participantsusing
a 1:1:1 enrollment schema (ratio of medical cohort to endovas-
cular cohort to surgical cohort), a within-participant correla-
tion coefficient of 0.7, and a percentage decline in WIQ score
from baseline of 15% (medical cohort), 7% (endovascular co-
hort), and 5% (surgical cohort), we estimated 89% power to
detect a difference in WIQ distance, 80% power to detect a dif-
ference in WIQ speed, and 94% power to detect a difference
in WIQ stair climb.
For the revascularization cohort, the index date was the
dateofrevascularization.Forthemedicalcohort,theindexdate
was defined as 28 days after the date of study enrollment be-
cause this period was the average time from the last clinic visit
to the surgery visit for patients in our vascular surgical regis-
try. We used an intent-to-treat analysis throughout and did not
reassign participants if they crossed over from the medical co-
horttotherevascularizationcohortatanytimeduringthestudy
follow-up period. For all analyses, the endovascular and sur-
gical cohorts were combined into 1 revascularization cohort.
We used descriptive statistics to summarize baseline
characteristics and t tests and χ2 tests to compare these vari-
ables between cohorts. Adjusted analyses were conducted
using generalized estimating equations with a robust variance
estimator. To account for repeated measures, we clustered on
patient identifier. Each dependent variable of interest was the
domain or total score on each PRO measure. The independent
variable of interest was the observed intervention, namely,
medical management vs revascularization. We calculated
the mean difference between cohorts at each time frame
(baseline, 6 months, and 12 months) and the mean and
percentage change scores within cohorts over time. Percent-
age change scores were calculated by subtracting the score
at follow-up from the score at baseline and dividing that
quantity by the baseline score. We then calculated the differ-
ence in differences between cohorts over time and the percent-
age change scores between cohorts over time. These percent-
agechangescoreswerecalculatedbysubtractingthepercentage
change score in the revascularization cohort from the percent-
age change score in the medically managed cohort.
All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, physician type, hy-
pertension, diabetes, smoking status, number of comorbidi-
ties, body mass index, duration of disease before enrollment,
and claudication severity. Separately, during the follow-up pe-
riod, we counted the number of any-cause hospitalizations oc-
curring after the index date and the number of deaths. We
evaluated the sensitivity of the results using multiple impu-
tation for missing data. Regression results were robust to these
imputations, so we present the results of the complete case
analysis. All analyses were performed using statistical soft-
ware (Stata, version 13; StataCorp LP).

were cared for by vascular surgeons, 33 (10.8%) were cared for
by cardiologists, and 7 (2.3%) were cared for by interven-
tional radiologists. At 12 months, survey response rates were
246 of 282 (87.2%) in the medical cohort and 39 of 41 (95.1%)
in the revascularization cohort.
Baseline characteristics between the 2 cohorts differed by
physiciantype,durationofdiseasebeforeenrollment,andphy-
sician-reported claudication severity, with the latter deter-
mined either by clinician use of the Rutherford clinical stag-
ing system34 or by a record of walking distance. Mild disease
was defined as a walking distance of 900 ft (274.5 m or 2-3
blocks), moderate disease as a walking distance of 600 ft (183.1
m or 1-2 blocks), and severe disease as a walking distance of
300 ft or less (≤91.4 m or <1 block).35 In the medical cohort,
smoking cessation counseling was offered to 60.6% (40 of 66)
of smokers, a walking program was discussed for 44.7% (126
of 282), and cilostazol or pentoxifylline was prescribed for
93.7% (89 of 95) and 6.3% (6 of 95), respectively (Table 1). Eigh-
teen participants crossed over from the medical cohort to the
revascularization cohort. Baseline characteristics of these par-
ticipants were not appreciably different from those in the re-
mainder of the medical cohort, so they were retained in the
medical cohort for analysis.
The baseline scores for 6 of 7 domains or outcomes sug-
gested no differences between the medical and revasculariza-
tion cohorts, with the exception being the EQ-5D (0.056; 95%
CI, 0.005-0.107). However, at 6 and 12 months, scores for 5 of
7 outcomes in the revascularization cohort were significantly
greater than in the medical cohort (Table 2, Figure 2, and
Figure 3).
In the medical cohort, the mean improvements in PRO
measures at 12 months were statistically significant for the fol-
lowing 3 outcomes: speed (5.9; 95% CI, 0.5-11.3; P = .03), Vas-
cuQoL (0.28; 95% CI, 0.08-0.49; P = .008), and EQ-5D (0.038;
95% CI, 0.011-0.066; P = .006). These percentage improve-
ments were 21.9%, 17%, and 11.7%, respectively (Table 2,
Figure 2B, and Figure 3A and B). The remaining scores re-
mained stable over time.
Intherevascularizationcohort,thereweresignificantmean
improvementsinalloutcomesbetweenbaselineand12months
as follows: distance (19.5; 95% CI, 7.9-31.0; P = .001), speed
(12.1; 95% CI, 1.4-22.8; P = .03), stair climb (11.4; 95% CI, 1.3-
21.5; P = .03), pain (20.7; 95% CI, 11.0-30.4; P < .001), Vas-
cuQoL (1.10; 95% CI, 0.80-1.41; P < .001), EQ-5D (0.113; 95%
CI, 0.067-0.159; P < .001), and CSI (−0.63; 95% CI, −0.96 to
−0.31; P < .001). These percentage improvements were 56.9%,
37.6%, 26.6%, 141.8%, 57.9%, 29.7%, and 16.1%, respectively.
Twelve-month scores were slightly lower than 6-month scores
(Table 2, Figure 2, and Figure 3). At 12 months, the improve-
ments in scores in the revascularization cohort compared with
the medical cohort (difference in differences) were as fol-
lows: distance (13.6; 95% CI, 0.7-26.6), speed (6.2; 95% CI, −5.8
to 18.2), stair climb (6.2; 95% CI, −5.6 to 18.1), pain (16.8; 95%
CI,6.2-27.4),VascuQoL(0.82;95%CI,0.45-1.19),EQ-5D(0.075;
95% CI, 0.021-0.128), and CSI (−0.53; 95% CI, −0.90 to −0.15).
These percentage changes were 39.1%, 15.6%, 9.7%, 116.9%,
41%, 18%, and 13.5%, respectively.
In the revascularization cohort, improvements in the Vas-
cuQoL at 6 months (mean change, 1.17) and 12 months (mean
change,1.10)exceededtheMIDforimprovementof0.87,while
in the medical cohort they did not (0.22 from baseline to 6
months and 0.28 from baseline to 12 months) (Table 2). The
same held true for the EQ-5D. In the revascularization co-
hort, the improvements at 6 months (mean change, 0.112) and
12 months (mean change, 0.113) exceeded the MID of 0.074,
while in the medical cohort they did not (0.034 at 6 months
and 0.038 at 12 months). Although Conjin and colleagues30 es-
timated an MID for the WIQ, we did not think it was appro-
priate to apply this value because their MID was based on the
Dutch version of the original WIQ, for which they calculated
a total WIQ score. We used the English version of the modi-
fied WIQ, for which no total score has been calculated, to our
knowledge.

Discussion
Revascularization procedures have traditionally been of-
fered only to patients with the most incapacitating claudica-
tion, in part because of a low risk of progression of claudica-
tion to limb loss and the potential for procedure-related
complications that might result in limb loss. The results of this
multisite prospective cohort study of patients with IC with
moderatetosevereclaudicationsuggestthatfunction,HRQoL,
and symptoms improved between baseline and 12 months in

ization in participants with less than severe claudication
suggestsabroaderrolefortheseinterventions,informationthat
may be helpful in clinical decision making.
Whencomparingourworkwiththatofothers,wefindthat
the benefits of supervised exercise therapy in patients with IC
is well documented.36 The added effect of medication therapy
is mixed, with evidence from the recent Cochrane systematic
review36 suggesting beneficial effects and a network
meta-analysis37 suggesting none. Investigators in the Claudi-
cation: Exercise Vs Endoluminal Revascularization (CLEVER)
study,38 a multisite RCT of patients with aortoiliac PAD, ran-
domized 111 patients to receive optimal medical care with or
without supervised exercise or stent revascularization. Their
results suggest that at 6 months the change in peak walking
time was greatest for the supervised exercise group, interme-
diate for the endovascular revascularization group, and least
for those who received only optimal medical care. In con-
trast, greater improvements in WIQ scores were observed in
the endovascular revascularization group than in the super-
vised exercise group. These authors called for further study
of the contrast between better walking performance for pa-
tients receiving exercise only and better overall function for
patients receiving endovascular care. Our results are consis-
tent with the CLEVER study in that walking speed improved
slightly in the medical cohort, although the exercise compo-
nent of our study was not supervised. Moreover, our com-
bined revascularization cohort had better functional and
HRQoL scores than patients in our medical cohort.
At 18 months of follow-up, the CLEVER study39 investi-
gators reported that the differences in peak walking time be-
tween the exercise and endovascular groups were no longer
significant but that both were significant compared with medi-
cal care. The results in quality-of-life outcomes were durable
for the endovascular group and the exercise group, although,
similar to our study, these results declined slightly after 6
months. These findings and those by McDermott and
colleagues25,40 suggest that exercise training, whether
supervised25 or home based,40 improves functional status.
Using network meta-analytic techniques to compare the
resultsofvariousRCTsofdifferenttreatments,Vemulapalliand
colleagues37 found that, compared with usual care, exercise
training improved walking distance, while revascularization
did not. All treatment modalities were associated with im-
proved quality of life as measured by the physical function do-
main on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, but there were
no differences between treatments. We, too, found that both

the medical and revascularization cohorts reported im-
proved function and quality of life, although our study did not
allow us to disaggregate exercise from other components of
medical management.
The strengths of this study include that it was performed
in the community, following up participants with high fidel-
ity through 1 year (88.2% [285 of 323] follow-up), with 246 in
the medical cohort and 39 in the revascularization cohort, to
trackoutcomesthataremostmeaningfultopatients.Apatient-
reported, validated, functional status measure (WIQ) was the
primary outcome and was used to determine study power.
Twelve-month study follow-up provides valuable informa-
tioncomparedwithstudiesofshorterduration.Usinganintent-
to-treat approach, we believe that the effects observed for our
comparisons between the cohorts are conservative. We also
investigated the effects of missing data using multiple impu-
tation methods. The effects observed under multiple impu-
tation scenarios were consonant with the complete case re-
sults presented herein.
Limitations include that, despite intense screening and re-
cruitment efforts, only a modest number of participants en-
rolled in the revascularization cohort. That our seasoned in-
vestigatorteamexperiencedsuchdifficultyinenrollingpatients
into a well-designed and properly executed cohort study pro-
vides further evidence of this already recognized phenom-
enon. Response rates in cohort studies have dropped over the
years, from 69% in the 1950s41,42 to 24% in 1989 in the Nurses’
HealthStudy.43Recently,tomaintaintargetedenrollmentrates,
the US National Children’
s Study44 has required the addition
of study sites and modification of sampling plans. Investiga-
tors who conducted the United Kingdom Cohort Study of Mo-
bilePhoneUseinHealth(COSMOS)45outline21st-centurytech-
nology–enabled solutions to address these challenges. Given
this limitation, our results are less precise and the power lower
than for the prespecified effect sizes. Even so, there were sig-
nificant differences in HRQoL outcomes between cohorts.
Separately, participants undergoing revascularization were
those with moderate to severe disease but of shorter dura-
tion, while more than one-third (38.8%) of those in the medi-
cal cohort were patients with mild disease. We are unable to
determine the extent to which coding bias contributes to this
difference because lifestyle-limiting claudication is the only
widely accepted indication for revascularization at present.
While these differences were accounted for in the analyses,

theylimitthegeneralizabilityofthefindingstothosewithsimi-
lar disease duration and levels of severity. Most participants
were managed by vascular surgeons using medical interven-
tions, and it is possible that including nonprocedural care pro-
vided by clinicians who are not proceduralists might have re-
sulted in different findings. That patients in the medical cohort
remainedstableorimprovedslightlyorovertimesuggeststhat
these interventions were administered properly, despite our
inability to assess adherence. Finally, the focus of this study
was PROs. Because our method of follow-up data collection
was limited to self-report, we were able to capture only a few
clinical outcomes, including walking distance (through WIQ
distance), any-cause readmissions, and death. More objec-
tive surrogate metrics, such as ankle brachial index or Dop-
pler arterial flow, were not assessed.
Although our findings suggest that revascularization in-
terventions may be a superior alternative to more conserva-
tive approaches, caution is warranted. These procedures are
expensive, frequently require reintervention, and in the long
run carry a substantial risk of worse outcomes in the patient.
Furthermore, the lack of greater improvement in function,
HRQoL, and symptoms in our medical cohort could have been
due to the fact that our definition of a walking program,
although prescribed by a physician, did not require supervi-
sion. Supervised exercise programs are not reimbursed and are
rarely available in the community. We believe that a sound ar-
gument can be made for the development and reimburse-
mentofsupervisedexerciseprograms,whichtheliteraturesup-
ports. Although this study shows that standard
revascularization care is better than standard medical care in
the community, it does not demonstrate that revasculariza-
tion care is better than optimal medical care, for which we
should continue to strive.
Conclusions
This comparative effectiveness research study of interven-
tions for IC demonstrated significantly higher function (WIQ),
better HRQoL (VascuQoL and EQ-5D), and fewer symptoms
(CSI) for those in the revascularization cohort compared with
the medical cohort. These results suggest that revasculariza-
tion interventions for patients with moderate to severe IC rep-
resent a reasonable alternative to medical management, pro-
viding important information to inform treatment strategies
in the community.
