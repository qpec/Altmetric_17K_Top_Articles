Introduction
A recent Cochrane review of graded exercise therapy 
(GET) for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) concluded that 
GET is effective and safe (Larun et al., 2017). The review 
was to determine the effects of exercise therapy for patients 
with CFS as compared with any other intervention or con-
trol. It included eight randomised controlled studies and 
reported data from 1510 participants: Fulcher and White 
(1997) (66), Wearden et al. (1998) (136), Powell et al. 
(2001) (148), Wallman et al. (2004) (61), Moss-Morris 
et al. (2005) (49), Jason et al. (2007) (114), Wearden et al. 
(2010b) (296) and White et al. (2011) (640) (number of 
patients in each study between parentheses).
Larun et al. (2017) state that CFS is sometimes called 
myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), but in the rest of their 
document, the term CFS is used. The same has been done 
here to avoid any confusion.
The review has been subject to criticism, for example, 
Kindlon (2015) and Courtney (2016). Here, we analyse the 
review and find seven general issues. We also identify a 
number of problems revealed in the original studies, includ-
ing a failure to report harms. Our analysis shows the 
review’s conclusion that GET is effective and safe is not 
supported by the evidence. When the objective outcomes of 
the trials are considered, it is possible to state that GET is 
ineffective for CFS.
Seven general issues
1. 
There are questions about conflicts of interest.
The review itself and seven of the eight studies (Jason et al., 
2007, the exception) were conducted by researchers with an 
allegiance to a particular model of CFS and to two interven-
tions, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and GET.
In studies examining more than one treatment approach, 
the treatment favoured by the researchers tends to outper-
form other treatments (Luborsky et al., 1999, 2002; Munder 
et al., 2012). Several factors may contribute to this effect, 
but one is likely to be the manner in which the non-favoured 
‘comparison’ treatment is conceptualised and implemented. 
Graded exercise therapy for myalgic 
encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue 
syndrome is not effective and unsafe.  
Re-analysis of a Cochrane review
Mark Vink1 and Alexandra Vink-Niese2
Abstract
The analysis of the 2017 Cochrane review reveals flaws, which means that contrary to its findings, there is no evidence 
that graded exercise therapy is effective. Because of the failure to report harms adequately in the trials covered by the 
review, it cannot be said that graded exercise therapy is safe. The analysis of the objective outcomes in the trials provides 
sufficient evidence to conclude that graded exercise therapy is an ineffective treatment for myalgic encephalomyelitis/
chronic fatigue syndrome.

Critical Review

Health Psychology Open 
A researcher’s enthusiasm for a particular treatment can 
also lead his/her to overinterpret their findings or overlook 
limitations (Wilshire, 2017).
Selection of the editorial group from the Cochrane 
Common Mental Disorders Group suggests a bias to a par-
ticular view of CFS as ME has been classified as a neuro-
logical disease by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
since 1969 with CFS as an equivalent. The four authors of 
the review are all known proponents of the biopsychosocial 
model, which views GET as an effective treatment for CFS.
Before they conducted their research, Fulcher (and 
White), Powell, Wearden, Wallman, Moss-Morris and 
White are all known to have favoured the approach to the 
illness being tested. It is notable that the one study con-
ducted by a researcher without an allegiance to the model 
concluded that none of the four treatment strategies was 
superior to another treatment strategy in all areas (Jason 
et al., 2007).
2. 
A study was excluded, which contradicted the main 
findings.
Núñez et al. (2011) was excluded from the Cochrane review 
because exercise therapy was a minor part of the interven-
tion and it did not measure outcomes viewed as primary 
outcomes in the review (Larun et al., 2017).
The trial compared multidisciplinary treatment combin-
ing CBT, GET and pharmacological treatment with usual 
treatment, with 1-year follow-up after the end of treatment. 
It concluded that at 12 months, the interventions did not 
improve health-related quality of life scores and led to 
worse physical function and bodily pain scores. Nuñez 
found that the combination of CBT and GET is ineffective 
and not evidence-based and may in fact be harmful.
3. 
Criteria used in the trials were too broad.
As inclusion criteria, five studies (Fulcher and White, 1997; 
Powell et al., 2001; Wearden et al., 1998, 2010b; White 
et al., 2011) used the Oxford criteria. Three studies (Moss-
Morris et al., 2005; Jason et al., 2007; Wallman et al., 2004) 
used the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
criteria, also known as the Fukuda Criteria (Fukuda et al., 
1994).
The only requirement for the Oxford criteria (Sharpe 
et al., 1991) is 6 months or more of unexplained fatigue. It 
was created as an alternative, less strict, operational defini-
tion which is essentially chronic fatigue in the absence of 
neurological signs with psychiatric symptoms as common 
associated features (David, 1991).
The Oxford criteria are untenable because they inappro-
priately select healthy subjects with mild fatigue and 
chronic idiopathic fatigue and mislabel them as CFS 
(Baraniuk, 2017). The American National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) concluded in 2014 that the Oxford criteria are 
flawed and include people with other conditions, confound-
ing the ability to interpret the science (Green et al., 2014a). 
Continuing to use the Oxford definition may impair pro-
gress and cause harm (Green et al., 2014a, 2014b). The 
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) 
stated that using the Oxford case definition results in a high 
risk of including patients who may have an alternate fatigu-
ing illness or whose illness resolves spontaneously with 
time (Smith et al., 2016). Both the NIH and AHRQ recom-
mend that the Oxford definition should be retired.
The Fukuda criteria are the most commonly used criteria 
for CFS. Patients need to have 6 months or more of unex-
plained chronic fatigue and have a minimum of four out of 
eight criteria. However, ME is characterised by an abnor-
mally delayed muscle recovery after trivial exertion 
(Ramsay, 1988), commonly referred to as post-exertional 
malaise (PEM). PEM is now accepted as a core symptom 
(IOM, 2015) of CFS but is only optional and not compul-
sory for diagnosis in Fukuda as it is one of the eight addi-
tional criteria (Fukuda et al., 1994). A total of 15 per cent of 
people labelled by these criteria as having CFS were in fact 
healthy people (Friedberg et al., 2000).
Moreover, around 40 per cent of participants in seven of 
the eight studies (Wallman et al., 2004, the exception with 
12%) suffered from co-morbid psychiatric disorders. The 
presence of a medical or psychiatric condition that may 
explain the chronic fatigue state excludes the classification 
as CFS in research studies because overlapping pathophysi-
ology may confound findings specific to CFS (Reeves 
et al., 2003).
The use of the Oxford and the Fukuda criteria in all eight 
of the studies means that they may have included patients 
who did not have CFS but who were susceptible to the 
interventions.
4. 
Entry score requirements were not sufficiently 
strict.
In five studies (Fulcher and White, 1997; Jason et al., 2007; 
Moss-Morris et al., 2005; Powell et al., 2001; Wearden 
et al., 1998), high-functioning patients may have been 
included.
Three studies (Fulcher and White, 1997; Jason et al., 
2007; Moss-Morris et al., 2005) did not have entry score 
requirements. In two further studies, entry requirements 
were such that relatively high-functioning participants 
were included: Wearden et al. (1998) had a physical func-
tioning score of up to 83.3, and in Powell et al. (2001), 
patients could be selected with an almost normal physical 
functioning score of up to 24 (included) out of 30.
Further questions about inclusion are raised in Moss-
Morris et al. (2005), where 77.6 per cent of patients were 
well enough to be in work, and in both Fulcher and White 
(1997) and Moss-Morris et al. (2005), where participants 
had normal VO2max scores.

It is likely that in five of the studies in the review patients 
were therefore included who may not have had CFS.
5. 
The review used subjective fatigue measured by 
questionnaires as the primary outcome.
All eight trials in the review were by definition unblinded, 
yet the review used two subjective primary outcomes, 
fatigue and adverse outcomes.
Patient self-report is an unreliable measure (Wechsler 
et al., 2011). Lack of patient blinding combined with self-
reporting of outcomes leads to pronounced bias as patients 
become prone to outside influences leading to the errone-
ous inference of efficacy in its absence, thus making sub-
jectively assessed outcomes unreliable (Hróbjartsson et al., 
2014; Lilienfeld et al., 2014). Low correlation between 
objective and subjective activity measurements (Scheeres 
et al., 2009) is not confined to the chronically ill but is also 
present in the healthy population (Van den Berg-Emons 
et al., 2011). For patients with CFS, there is a particular 
problem with subjective outcomes as they may feel better 
able to cope with daily activities because they have reduced 
their expectations of what they should achieve, rather than 
because they have made any recovery as a result of the 
intervention (Whiting et al., 2001).
The review itself acknowledges this problem and states 
that all studies were at risk of performance bias, as they 
were unblinded (Larun et al., 2017). The only way to cor-
rect for this problem in unblinded trials is by using well-
designed control groups and objective primary outcomes 
(Edwards, 2017; Lilienfeld et al., 2014). All trials in the 
review, apart from Powell et al. (2001), used objective out-
comes, so it would have been possible for the Cochrane 
review to have used them.
Any conclusion that the intervention was effective must 
be seen as unreliable because of the use of subjective out-
comes in unblinded studies.
6. 
The Chalder Fatigue Scale is flawed.
Seven of the eight trials (Jason et al. (2007), the exception) 
used the Chalder Fatigue Scale to measure fatigue.
Four flaws have been identified with the use of the 
Scale.
First, it does not provide a comprehensive reflection of 
fatigue-related severity, symptomology, or functional disa-
bility in CFS (Haywood et al., 2011), as it was developed 
by mental health professionals, and many questions are 
geared towards depression and not CFS (Chalder et al., 
1993).
Second, the ceiling effect means that a maximum score 
at baseline cannot increase even if there is deterioration 
during the trial. As a consequence, for example, if a partici-
pant deteriorated during the trial on eight items and 
improved on three, the score should reflect a deterioration 
of five points. However, if they had scored the maximum at 
baseline, then since eight scores cannot get worse and three 
scores have improved, the Chalder Fatigue Scale would 
classify the participant, who had deteriorated by five points, 
as improved by three points.
Analysis of the use of the Chalder Fatigue Scale in CFS 
patients who were well enough to attend an outpatient 
clinic found high rates of maximal scoring (Morriss et al., 
1998). This issue was a particular concern in Wearden et al. 
(2010b). A review of the mean and standard deviation data 
for that trial calculated that between 65 and 82 per cent in 
the pragmatic rehabilitation group (PR) must have recorded 
the maximum score at baseline (Stouten, 2010). Since the 
patients were more severely afflicted and unable to attend 
outpatient clinics, there was a high likelihood of maximum 
scores at baseline
Third, the Scale has been found to be unreliable in dis-
tinguishing between healthy controls and fatigue. In a trial 
of CBT for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), it was 
found that after treatment, fatigued MS patients had less 
fatigue than healthy controls (Van Kessel et al., 2008).
Fourth, few items on the Chalder Fatigue Scale appear 
clearly related to fatigue and there is a focus on change in 
fatigue, rather than intensity (Wilshire et al., 2018a).
The use of the flawed Chalder Fatigue Scale to measure 
subjective fatigue and hence the primary outcome further 
casts doubt on the trial’s and review’s conclusions.
7. 
There are concerns about dropouts.
The percentage of dropouts differed substantially between 
the trials.
Participants who do not respond to treatment or are neg-
atively affected by it are more likely to drop out or be lost 
to follow up (Lilienfeld et al., 2014). In Wearden et al. 
(1998), 37.3 per cent dropped out in the two exercise groups 
combined but only 21.7 per cent in the two control groups 
combined. In Powell et al. (2001), 18 per cent dropped out 
from the exercise groups compared to only 5.9 per cent 
from the control group. In Moss-Morris et al. (2005), this 
was 12 and 0 per cent, respectively.
Only 6 per cent dropped out in the GET group of White 
et al. (2011); however, according to the supplement to the 
secondary mediation paper, there were missing step test 
data for 34 per cent (GET) (Chalder et al., 2015), which 
may have inflated any improvement in the GET group on 
that test. These dropouts add further doubts about the reli-
ability of the review’s findings.
Analysis of the trials
Fulcher and White (1997)
The trial concluded that graded aerobic exercise is an effec-
tive treatment for CFS. Patients reported an improvement 
on the primary outcome (self-rated clinical global impres-
sion change score) represented by a score of 1 or 2. 
 4 
Health Psychology Open 
However, if a categorisation into 1–3 (all scores represent-
ing an improvement) and 4–7 (the rest) had been used, then 
there would have been no significant difference between 
the two treatment groups.
Because of their separate effects on fatigue, Fulcher 
excluded patients with a current psychiatric disorder or 
symptomatic insomnia, apart from simple co-morbid pho-
bias, yet 30.3 per cent (20/66) in the trial were on full dose 
antidepressants. Symptomatic insomnia (sleep reversal 
and/or unrefreshing sleep) is a common and important 
symptom of CFS, so excluding such patients would seem to 
have excluded patients with a common symptom of CFS.
Participants in the exercise group had sessions of 
5–15 minutes, increasing to a maximum of 30 minutes, at 
least 5 days a week. Such a workload would exclude most 
patients with CFS.
Doubts about the diagnosis are further cast by the VO2max 
scores. The average VO2max for healthy sedentary controls 
of a similar age as in the trial, 37, is 30–36 (De Becker 
et al., 2000). The American Medical Association (AMA) 
(Gunnar and Occhiarella, 2000) categorises impairment as 
follows (VO2max; mL/kg/min): no impairment, >25; mild 
impairment, 20–25; moderate impairment, 15–20; and 
severe impairment, <15. Scores for CFS patients in another 
study (VanNess et al., 2003) were 22.1 (mild impairment), 
17.2 (moderate impairment), and 12.3 (severe impairment). 
In Fulcher and White (1997), the VO2max score at baseline 
in the GET group was 31.8, in other words unimpaired 
according to the AMA categorisation and well above even 
mildly impaired CFS patients in VanNess et al. (2003).
The exclusion of patients with a common symptom of 
CFS, the inclusion of patients on full dose antidepressants, 
the high level of fitness of the participants and the relatively 
onerous workload completed by those in the exercise group 
raise very serious concerns about whether this was in fact a 
trial for patients with CFS.
Wearden et al. (1998)
Three problems are apparent with this trial.
First, it used too broad criteria to select patients. Not 
only did it use the Oxford criteria, but it set a physical func-
tioning score of <83.3 to designate caseness and 46 per 
cent of participants had a current psychiatric diagnosis. 
Subjects randomised to graded exercise were instructed to 
carry out aerobic activity for 20 minutes, at least three times 
a week, a level of activity beyond most patients with CFS.
Second, the exercise and placebo group and its control 
group, the exercise control and placebo group, are difficult 
to compare with each other because of the big difference 
(30.7%) in VO2max scores at baseline, 19.9 and 26.0, 
respectively.
Third, since more participants dropped out from and 
fewer complied fully with the GET groups, it would seem 
impossible to draw any safe conclusions. In total, 37.3 per 
cent dropped out of the two GET groups combined and 
only a small percentage (34.3%) of participants complied 
fully with GET. In contrast, only 21.7 per cent dropped out 
in the two exercise placebo groups and 78.3 per cent com-
plied fully with exercise placebo. The difference in these 
two rates is particularly a concern since patients who 
dropped out were significantly more likely to have changed 
or given up their occupation as a result of their illness.
Even with these apparent biases towards the exercise 
groups, by 26 weeks the exercise capacity in the GET group 
improved by only 4.3 per cent more than in its control 
group. Increases of 20 per cent have been observed in 
patients with stable chronic heart failure after only 3 weeks 
of training (Meyer et al., 1997). Furthermore, the mean 
fatigue scores at the end of treatment in the two GET groups 
were 29.9 and 28.0 so that patients were still ill enough to 
meet the entry criteria for the trial (cut-off of 4 or more to 
designate caseness; 0–42).
Powell et al. (2001)
Similar problems afflict Powell et al. (2001). The entry 
physical functioning score was <25, a score of 25 deemed 
similar to normal daily functioning for the UK general pop-
ulation. However, the main outcome measure and predeter-
mined criterion for clinically important improvement was a 
score of 25 or more or an increase of >10 on the SF-36 
physical functioning subscale (range: 10–30) 1 year after 
randomisation. In other words, a patient could enter the 
trial with a score of 24, improve to 25 over the course of the 
trial, and this minimal improvement would be deemed clin-
ically important.
The trial employed non-equivalent controls which 
favoured the interventions. A minimum number of sessions 
were stipulated for the treatment groups: 3 hours face-to-
face and 1 hour telephone contact for the minimum inter-
vention group, 3 hours face-to-face and 4.5 hours telephone 
contact for the telephone intervention group and 10 hours 
face-to-face and 1.5 hour telephone contact for the maxi-
mum intervention group. There was no such specification 
for the control group. It is possible those in the control 
group had zero hours of contact and it was therefore no 
more than a waitlist group. This was recognised in the arti-
cle where it is acknowledged that one of the limitations was 
the lack of a placebo control group that received equivalent 
therapist time and attention.
The hospital anxiety and depression scale scores suggest 
that instead of treating the CFS, the interventions addressed 
the patients’ depression. At baseline, patients had high 
depression (9.3, 9.0 and 9.0) and anxiety scores (10.6, 10.0 
and 10.2) for the minimum intervention, telephone inter-
vention and maximum intervention groups, respectively. 
One year after randomisation, the depression scores 
improved dramatically to 4.2, 4.6 and 4.2, and the anxiety 
scores less so to 7.1, 6.5 and 7.7. In the control group, 
 Vink and Vink-Niese 
5
however, the scores remained roughly the same: 10.4 and 
10.1 for depression and 11.2 and 10.1 for anxiety, at base-
line and 1 year after randomisation, respectively.
Once again, there was a problem with selection criteria, 
33.8 per cent (50/148) of the participants were working at 
the start of the trial and dropouts. The dropout rate was 
16.2 per cent (6/37) for the minimum intervention, 18 per 
cent (7/39) for the telephone intervention and 18.4 per cent 
(7/38) for the maximum intervention. In contrast, the con-
trol group dropout rate was much lower at 5.9 per cent 
(2/34).
These flaws make any conclusion that the interventions 
were effective impossible.
Wallman et al. (2004)
Despite its claim to show graded exercise improves func-
tional ability and minimises deconditioning, which can 
result in more symptoms, and that these improvements may 
be associated with the abandonment of avoidance behav-
iours, it would appear that the trial was not of graded exer-
cise but of a form of pacing.
In graded exercise therapy for CFS, planned physical 
activity and not symptoms dictate what participants do 
(Bavinton et al., 2004). Participants in this trial, though, 
were instructed to exercise every second day, unless they 
had a relapse. If this occurred, or if symptoms became 
worse, the next exercise session was shortened or can-
celled. Subsequent exercise sessions were reduced to a 
length the patient felt manageable.
Since the exercise treatment allowed patients to decrease 
as well as increase how much exercise they did, depending 
on their symptoms, the intervention being evaluated was in 
fact not GET but a form of pacing (Goudsmit et al., 2012).
Moss-Morris et al. (2005)
This trial had a biased sample: participants were from a pri-
vate clinic and had contacted the university, so were self-
selected. They were, then, invested in the trial and more 
likely to believe in the possible effectiveness of the inter-
ventions. Furthermore, patients were high functioning: 
only 22.4 per cent were unemployed and unable to work 
due to disability, indicating 77.6 per cent were employed 
and therefore only mildly affected. As many as 30 and 
42 per cent of the sample, though, were possibly suffering 
from depression and anxiety, respectively.
The groups were poorly matched: there was a difference 
in mean ages (36.7 in the GET group, 45.5 in the SMC 
control), illness duration (2.67 years GET, 5.0 years SMC) 
and SF-36 physical functioning scores (53.10, GET; 45.65 
SMC) at baseline.
Although it was concluded that graded exercise appears 
to be an effective treatment for CFS, patients showed no 
objective improvement. In fact, there was a significant 
physical deterioration after ‘effective’ GET as seen in the 
large drop in VO2max of 15 per cent. Since there is an inverse 
relation between fatigue and activity (Rongen-van Dartel 
et al., 2014), a decrease in fatigue should have been matched 
by an objective increase in physical functioning.
The study acknowledges that the intervention (GET) did 
not have a significant effect on fitness. Any conclusions, 
then, about the effectiveness of the treatment cannot be 
sustained.
Jason et al. (2007)
The review says this trial showed little or no difference in 
fatigue between anaerobic exercise and treatment as usual 
at follow-up. It states that the better physical functioning 
scores for relaxation therapy were because the relaxation 
group (RELAX) had a higher mean score at baseline than 
the anaerobic activity group (ACT), 53.77 and 39.17, 
respectively. However, the objective 6-minute walk test 
results at baseline were similar: 1335 (ACT) versus 1317 
(RELAX; higher scores indicating better outcome). The 
physical functioning scores did improve more for the 
RELAX group: an increase of 12.1 per cent from baseline 
for RELAX, compared to 1.4 per cent for ACT.
In other tests, the RELAX group also performed better. 
Improvement in the 6-minute walk test was 3.2 per cent 
(ACT) and 8.4 per cent (RELAX), and in quality of life scores 
3.5 per cent (ACT) and 12.3 per cent (RELAX). The RELAX 
group performed better for difference in symptom outcome, 
improvement for muscle pain, unrefreshing sleep and PEM.
The trial would seem to show, contrary to the conclusion 
in the review, that participants in the relaxation group 
improved more than those in the exercise group.
Wearden et al. (2010b)
There were once again problems with entry requirements 
for this trial: Criteria included 70 (out of 100) or lower on 
the SF-36 physical functioning scale, but one patient was 
admitted to the trial with a score of 75; 20.3 per cent 
(60/296) of the participants suffered from anxiety and 
17.9 per cent (53/296) from depression.
The trial was not properly controlled. The PR group on 
average received 11.63 sessions (9.63 with the therapist + 2 
general practitioner (GP) consultations), the supportive lis-
tening group (SL) had 12.5 (9.5 + 3 GP consultations) and 
the treatment as usual (GPTAU) control group had only 
three GP consultations.
The entry criteria and outcomes were switched after the 
trial had started. Dates for the trial are given as from 21 
June 2004 to 25 July 2008 in the protocol registered with 
the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials 
Number (ISRCTN). The selection criteria were changed in 
February 2005, from the Fukuda to the even wider Oxford 
criteria. No reason was given (Wearden, 2001).

According to the FINE trial protocol (Wearden et al., 
2006), primary outcomes were to be self-reported physical 
functioning and fatigue at 1 year. Yet in the 2010 paper, the 
measures were taken instead at the end of treatment, 
20 weeks and 70 weeks from recruitment.
The step test was an objective secondary outcome meas-
ure in the protocol but was omitted from the 2010 paper. 
Not publishing results jeopardises the validity of a study 
(Heneghan et al., 2017). The results were published 3 years 
later (Wearden and Emsley, 2013), and there were no dif-
ferences between pragmatic rehabilitation and GP treat-
ment. Three Dutch studies that also did not publish their 
step test results on analysis many years later by proponents 
of the biopsychosocial model also showed no objective dif-
ferences between treatment and control (Wiborg et al., 
2010).
The fatigue scores were changed from bimodal (0–11) to 
Likert (0–33) in a Rapid Response in the BMJ (Wearden 
et al., 2010a) and in Wearden and Emsley (2013). Re-scored 
there was now a clinically modest, but statistically signifi-
cant effect of PR compared with GPTAU at both outcome 
points. However, altering measures in this way after the 
trial to find a small effect suggests a form of p-hacking.
The entry criteria, outcome switching and null objective 
improvement in this trial mean that it is unsafe to claim any 
effect for the interventions.
White et al. (2011)
This trial was the largest, 640 patients in a review that 
included 1510. A number of similar flaws have been 
identified.
Patients were included with depression or anxiety: 
47 per cent of participants had a co-morbid depression or 
anxiety disorder and only 20 per cent (640/3158) of partici-
pants screened were selected for the study.
The control group did not have the same contact hours: 
the CBT group received on average 16 sessions, the GET 
group 17 sessions (both including three sessions of SMC), 
yet the SMC group only had five. This imbalance creates 
serious biases towards finding a positive effect for the inter-
vention, regardless of whether it is effective or not 
(Lilienfeld et al., 2014).
A null effect at long-term follow-up was spun as posi-
tive. Outcomes with SMC alone or adaptive pacing therapy 
(APT) improved from the 1-year outcome and were similar 
to CBT and GET at long-term follow-up, but it was claimed 
that the data should be interpreted in the context of addi-
tional therapies having being given after the 1-year trial 
final assessment (Sharpe et al., 2015). However, the long-
term follow-up (Supplementary Appendix) shows the 
majority of participants did not have any additional CBT 
(76%) or GET (83%) after the trial. It also shows that 
patients in all four groups who did not receive additional 
treatment subsequent to trial completion exhibited lower 
fatigue and higher physical functioning scores relative to 
those of patients who received additional treatment (Vink, 
2016).
Baseline figures were used for one objective test, an 
actometer, a reliable measure of activity to assess improve-
ment objectively (Scheeres et al., 2009), but were not 
recorded at the end of the trial. The reason given was that it 
would be too great a burden (Vink, 2016) for patients, even 
though they had consented to use it; they had completed 
moderately effective treatment (White et al. (2011) and 
22 per cent of those in the CBT and GET groups had recov-
ered (White et al., 2013).
An extensive number of endpoint changes were made 
(Sharpe et al., 2015; Vink, 2016; White et al., 2011; Wilshire 
et al., 2018b). The timing of these changes – several months 
after trial completion – was highly problematic (Wilshire 
et al., 2018b). As a result, there was an overlap in entry and 
recovery criteria: 13.3 per cent of participants were already 
recovered according to one (12.8%) or two (0.5%) of the 
recovery criteria at trial entry (Vink, 2017a).
These changes affected both the physical functioning 
scores and the fatigue scores. The minimum physical func-
tioning score required to qualify as recovered was reduced 
from 85 to 60 (White et al., 2011). The maximum score for 
trial entry was increased from 60 to 65 (0–100; higher 
scores indicating better functioning), although according to 
the PACE trial’s recovery article, a score of 65 or less rep-
resents ‘abnormal levels of physical function’ (White et al., 
2013) and severe disability according to the literature 
(Stulemeijer et al., 2005). Participants with a score of 60–
65 (inclusive) were thus considered ill enough to partici-
pate and to have an abnormal level of physical functioning, 
yet were also recovered and severely disabled. Three par-
ticipants (0.45%) saw their physical functioning score go 
down from 65 to 60, reflecting deterioration, and three oth-
ers (0.45%) had unchanged physical functioning scores, but 
all (0.9%) were still classed as recovered, according to the 
physical functioning recovery criterion (Vink, 2017b).
Something similar happened to the fatigue scores. When 
PACE was registered with the ISRCTN on 22 May 2003, 
participants needed a Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ) 
score of 4 or more to be classed as ill enough to take part 
(White, 2003). The CFQ entry criterion was changed to six 
or more before the trial started and then during an unblinded 
trial switched from bimodal to Likert, 18 or more to qualify. 
To be classed as recovered, a bimodal score of ⩽3 out of 11, 
which represented a screening threshold for abnormal 
fatigue, was changed to a Likert score of 18 or less (0–33) 
(White et al., 2013). Consequently, with a Likert score of 18, 
one was simultaneously classed as disabled and recovered.
These endpoint changes increased recovery rates of 
CBT and GET fourfold. Had the PACE trial stuck to the 
protocol defined endpoints, then there would have been no 
statistically significant difference in recovery rates between 
the four treatment groups (Wilshire et al., 2018b).

The net improvement of the quality of life scores (EQ-
5D) after GET at 52 weeks over the adaptive pacing control 
group 
was 
1 per 
cent 
(13.5% 
(0.07/0.52)–12.5% 
(0.06/0.48)). A study by Olesen et al. (2016) of 20,220 adult 
patients found a mean quality of life score of 0.84 for the 
total population and 0.93 for people without a chronic con-
dition. Yet the quality of life at 52 weeks in the GET group 
(0.59) (McCrone et al., 2012) was similar to the score 
(0.60) for people with five or more chronic health condi-
tions and still worse than in cerebral thrombosis (0.62), 
rheumatoid arthritis and angina (0.65), acute myocardial 
infarction (AMI) (0.66) (Olesen et al., 2016), MS (0.67), 
lung cancer (0.69), stroke (0.71) or ischaemic heart disease 
(0.72) (higher scores indicating a better quality of life) 
(Falk Hvidberg et al., 2015).
Also, there was no statistically significant difference in 
the improvement in CFS symptom count between GET and 
SMC (p = 0.0916) or APT (p = 0.23) at 52 weeks.
These flaws in both the review and the trial render 
unsafe any conclusion that GET is effective.
Evidence on harms
According to the review, only two studies reported on 
safety or adverse reactions and in the larger (White et al., 
2011) there are questions about the definition used.
The review acknowledges that limited information 
makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the safety 
of exercise therapy yet claims no evidence to suggest exer-
cise therapy may worsen outcomes. This conclusion relies 
on the fact that White et al. (2011) reported only two seri-
ous adverse reactions (SARs) possibly related to treatment, 
and Wearden et al. (2010b) reported no SARs due to 
therapy.
However, the claims that the interventions in White 
et al. (2011) are safe are based on an unrealistic definition 
of harms. Adverse events were considered serious when 
they involved death, hospital admission, increased severe 
and persistent disability, self harm, were life-threatening or 
required an intervention to prevent one of these (White 
et al., 2011). These are not harms normally complained of 
by patients.
Furthermore, reports in both Moss-Morris et al. (2005) 
and Wearden et al. (1998) raise concerns. Moss-Morris 
et al. (2005) found that for 40 per cent of participants exer-
cise led to worsening of symptoms. 12 per cent dropped out 
from the GET group yet 0 per cent from the control group.
In Wearden et al. (1998), only 34.3 per cent of partici-
pants complied fully with GET compared to 78.3 per cent 
who complied fully with the control group treatment, pac-
ing. 37.3 per cent dropped out of the two graded exercise 
treatment groups combined, while only 21.7 per cent 
dropped out of the two control groups combined. Patients 
who dropped out were significantly more likely to have 
changed or given up their occupation as a result of 
their illness (Wearden et al., 1998). A treatment cannot be 
considered safe if patients do not actually adhere to it 
(Kindlon, 2017).
Caution about the safety of GET is particularly neces-
sary given the consistent finding in patient surveys that the 
intervention has caused worsened health in a large percent-
age of patients (25% ME group, 2004; Action for ME, 
2011; Bjørkum et al., 2009; Bringsli et al., 2014; De Kimpe 
et al., 2016; De Veer and Francke, 2008; Eyssens, 2017; 
Geraghty et al., 2017; Kindlon, 2011, 2017; ME 
Association, 
2010, 2015). For example, in a survey by Action for ME 
(2011), 60.2 per cent of people with ME reported that GET 
had made their condition worse, 44.1 per cent reported that 
it had made it much worse or very much worse. The ME 
Association (2015) found that in 74 per cent, GET had 
made their condition worse. In 82 per cent of patients who 
were housebound or bedridden, their health had been nega-
tively affected by GET and some patients were not severely 
affected before trying GET (25% ME group, 2004).
It has also been shown that patients have a low tolerance 
for physical activity or mild exercise, which can provoke 
symptoms (Snell et al., 2013; VanNess et al., 2010) and the 
experiences of harm from GET by CFS patients are well 
supported by the scientific literature (VanNess et al., 2018).
Furthermore, GET protocols indirectly discourage 
research participants from reporting harm. A key feature of 
GET is pushing beyond limits and participants are told to 
interpret symptom flares experienced during a study as a 
normal exercise response and reconditioning (Bavinton 
et al., 2004). The GET manual may instruct patients to view 
negative experiences as unhelpful (White et al., 2007) or 
they may be told that ‘Activity or exercise cannot harm 
you’ (Powell and the FINE trial research team, 2005).
The failure of most studies to report on safety or adverse 
reactions and the unrealistic definition used by White et al. 
(2011) mean that it is not possible to conclude GET is safe.
Review of the objective outcomes
Analysis shows the review’s conclusion that GET is effec-
tive and safe is not justified by the evidence. It is worth 
attempting to see whether anything can be properly inferred 
from the trials. Objective outcomes reveal GET to be 
ineffective.
It is worth noting that the GET model is at odds with the 
physiological findings (Helmfrid, 2016). Physical decondi-
tioning does not seem to be a perpetuating factor in CFS 
(Bazelmans et al., 2001) and CFS patients without a co-
morbid psychiatric disorder do not have an exercise phobia 
(Gallagher et al., 2005).
Powell et al. (2001) did not use objective outcomes. The 
seven other trials that did use objective outcomes, only 
Fulcher and White (1997) (6.9%) and Wearden et al. (1998) 
(4.3%), showed a minimal improvement in the intervention 
group compared to the control. However, there are reasons 
 8 
Health Psychology Open 
to consider this minimal benefit with caution. Both trials 
used the broad Oxford criteria, had a high percentage of 
participants with a psychiatric disorder and failed to exclude 
very high-functioning participants. Fulcher and White 
(1997) had no entry score requirements so that participants 
were selected with a normal VO2max score and no impair-
ment according to the AMA, and in Wearden et al. (1998), 
participants could have a physical functioning score of up 
to 83.3.
A large number of patients were excluded from Fulcher 
and White (1997) (60.5%), which used a walking test to 
measure improvement. It is possible that patients concen-
trated on the exercise and slightly increased walking at the 
expense of other areas of their life. In Wearden et al. (1998), 
a higher percentage of participants dropped out of exercise 
(37.3%) compared to the control groups (21.7%).
Even then, the difference in improvement in the exercise 
groups was only 4–7 per cent. Increases of 20 per cent have 
been observed in patients with stable chronic heart failure 
after only 3 weeks of exercising (Meyer et al., 1997). A 
major criterion for defining CFS is a reduction in physical 
capacity of at least 50 per cent compared to pre-illness lev-
els (De Becker et al., 2000; Fukuda et al., 1994; Holmes 
et al., 1988) so an improvement of 4–7 per cent would still 
leave patients considerably worse off than before the 
illness.
In Wallman et al. (2004), although the oxygen uptake 
values (VO2max) were 9.6 per cent higher after the interven-
tion in the exercise group, the difference in final values for 
the groups was not significant and the activity levels did not 
differ between the groups.
Moss-Morris et al. (2005) found no statistically sig-
nificant group effect for the physiological variables, 
including the maximum heart rate achieved, the percent-
age of the predicted maximum heart rate and the VO2max. 
The intervention (GET) did not have a significant effect 
on fitness; in fact, there was a large drop in VO2max of 
15 per cent.
In the 6-minute walk test in Jason et al. (2007), the ACT 
group improved by 3.2 per cent, yet patients in the relaxa-
tion control group improved by 5.2 per cent more, an 
improvement matched in the quality of life scores (3.5%, 
ACT; 12.3%, RELAX), symptom outcome improvement 
for muscle pain, unrefreshing sleep and PEM.
When the scores for the only objective outcome used in 
Wearden et al. (2010b), the step test, were published in 
2013, there were no differences between the pragmatic 
rehabilitation and GP treatment as usual groups on any of 
the step test measures at 20 or 70 weeks.
An even larger number of patients were excluded from 
White et al. (2011) (79.7%). Their step test did not show 
any objective improvements. This is matched by the net 
improvement of the quality of life scores after GET over 
APT of only 1 per cent. The number of patients who were 
unable to work and who were receiving benefits increased 
and the number of patients receiving income protection in 
the GET group actually doubled. In addition, there was no 
statistically significant difference in the improvement in 
CFS symptom count between GET and SMC (p = 0.0916) 
or APT (p = 0.23) at 52 weeks.
There was a slight benefit shown in the 6-minute walk 
test after exercise for 24 weeks. Patients with stable chronic 
heart failure improved their 6-minute walk test results by 
65 per cent after only 3 weeks of exercising (Meyer et al., 
1997). Also, since the actometers were used at the beginning 
of the trial but not after ‘effective’ treatments, as with 
Fulcher and White (1997), it is not known whether patients 
concentrated on the exercise and slightly increased walking 
at the expense of other areas of their life. This doubt is all 
the greater since despite exercising five times a week with a 
target of 30 minutes a time for 24 weeks, the fitness levels of 
those in the GET group did not improve. This suggests that 
there was an underlying physical problem preventing this.
Even after the slight improvement measured on the walk 
test, patients would still be ill enough to be put on the wait-
ing list for a lung transplant. No one in the trial achieved 
actual recovery, where symptoms are eliminated and 
patients return to pre-morbid levels of functioning 
(Kennedy, 2002), which is the general public’s understand-
ing of the meaning of recovery (Vink, 2017a). The PACE 
trial protocol defined improvement as an increase of 50 per 
cent. According to the 6-minute walk test results, the only 
objective individual results that were released, this bench-
mark was matched by 6.3 per cent in the GET group, but 
also 5 per cent in the SMC group, implying an effect of 
GET of only 1.3 per cent (2/160) as participants in all treat-
ment groups also received SMC (Vink, 2017a).
The trial omitted from the review, Núñez et al. (2011), 
found that at 12 months the intervention did not improve 
health-related quality of life scores and led to worse physi-
cal function and bodily pain scores. They also concluded 
that the combination of CBT and GET is ineffective and not 
evidence-based and may in fact be harmful.
Stordeur et al., (2008) analysed the effectiveness of CBT 
and GET in the Belgian CFS knowledge centres. They 
found no objective improvements after CBT and GET 
(VO2max) and fewer people were able to work and more 
people were receiving illness benefits.
Two American government agencies, the CDC (2017) 
and the AHRQ (Smith et al., 2016), have recently removed 
(CDC) and downgraded (AHRQ) their recommendations 
for CBT and GET, because there is insufficient evidence 
that GET is effective. The Dutch Health Council (2018) has 
removed its recommendation for GET in March 2018 for 
the same reason.
Conclusion
The GET trials reviewed here are inherently biased: use of 
exercise may attract only the mildly affected and may deter 
 Vink and Vink-Niese 
9
the more disabled patients from participating. These trials 
go back for more than two decades, at the cost of consider-
able money and involving large numbers of patients. The 
flaws in the review and the trials, as discussed above, all 
created a bias in favour of the exercise intervention. Despite 
these flaws, they have found no significant evidence of 
objective improvement. The analysis of the objective out-
comes in the trials provides sufficient evidence to conclude 
GET is an ineffective treatment for ME/CFS.
Most studies failed to report on safety or adverse reac-
tions, and White et al. (2011), one of the two studies that 
did, used an unrealistic definition. ME is characterised by 
an abnormally delayed muscle recovery after trivial exer-
tion (Ramsay, 1988), commonly referred to as PEM. 
Exercise physiology studies reveal abnormalities in 
patients’ responses to exertion. Yet PEM is not a require-
ment for diagnosis according to the Oxford criteria, used by 
five of the studies, and only an optional criterion according 
to the Fukuda criteria, used by the other three studies in the 
review. If patients do not suffer from PEM, it is likely that 
they will have no problems exercising. This might be an 
important reason why outside of clinical trials things are 
different with many patients, who do suffer from PEM, 
reporting deterioration with GET. Given these considera-
tions, one cannot conclude that GET is safe.
