BACKGROUND: Degenerative mitral valve (MV) disease is a common 
cause of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and accounts for the majority of 
MV operations. Conventional MV surgery requires cardiopulmonary bypass, 
aortic cross-clamping, cardioplegia, and a thoracotomy or sternotomy and, 
therefore, is associated with significant disability, risks, and unpredictable 
rates of MV repair. Transesophageal echocardiography–guided beating-heart 
MV repair with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene cordal insertion has the 
potential to significantly reduce surgical morbidity. We report the first-in-human 
clinical experience with a novel preformed expanded polytetrafluoroethylene 
knot implantation device (Harpoon TSD-5) designed to treat degenerative MR.
METHODS: Through a small left thoracotomy, the device was inserted 
into the heart and guided by transesophageal echocardiography to 
the ventricular surface of the prolapsed leaflet. Multiple expanded 
polytetrafluoroethylene cords were anchored in the leaflet and then 
adjusted to the correct length to restore MV leaflet coaptation and secured 
at the epicardium.
RESULTS: Eleven patients with posterior leaflet prolapse and severe MR, 
with mean±SD age of 65±13 years and mean ejection fraction of 69±7%, 
were treated with 100% procedural success. Immediate postprocedural 
mean MR grade was trace. At 1 month, the mean MR grade was mild with 
significant decreases in end-diastolic volume (139 to 107 mL; P=0.03) and 
left atrial volume (118 to 85 mL; P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: A novel device used for beating-heart image-guided 
MV repair demonstrates a significant reduction in MR with favorable left 
ventricular and left atrial reverse remodeling. This approach has the 
potential to decrease invasiveness and surgical morbidity. Further follow-up 
is necessary to assess long-term efficacy.

M
itral valve disease is the most prevalent heart valve 
disorder and is 3 to 4 times more common than 
aortic valve disease. Significant mitral regurgita-
tion (MR) affects ≈2% of the total population and 9% of the 
population >75 years of age.1 MR causes volume over-
load of the left ventricle (LV), which in turn can progress 
to ventricular dilation, decreased ejection performance, 
pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial 
fibrillation (AF), right ventricular dysfunction, and eventu-
ally death. Degenerative MR is the most common indica-
tion for mitral valve surgery in North America.2 Introduced 
clinically in 1986, mitral valve repair with expanded polytet-
rafluoroethylene (ePTFE) artificial cords has been shown 
to be equivalent to leaflet resection techniques3 and is in-
creasingly being used in conventional mitral valve repair 
operations.4 Although effective, conventional mitral valve 
surgery requires cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-
clamping, cardioplegia, and a thoracotomy or sternotomy. 
It is therefore associated with significant disability and 
risks, including stroke, renal failure, widely variable rates 
of mitral valve repair versus replacement, and death.5 As a 
result, there is intense interest in the development of less 
invasive therapies for the treatment of MR. In this report, 
we describe the initial clinical experience with the safety 
and performance of a device designed to implant ePTFE 
artificial cords and to correct degenerative MR in the beat-
ing heart with echocardiographic image guidance.
MethODs
study Design and Oversight
We conducted this prospective, observational, early-feasibility 
trial to test the safety and performance of a novel ePTFE inser-
tion device for mitral valve repair. The trial was conducted at 
2 clinical centers (Jagiellonian University John Paul II Hospital, 
Krakow, and Institute of Cardiology, Warsaw, Poland) and was 
sponsored by Harpoon Medical Inc. The protocol was approved 
by the ethics committee at each participating institution and 
received central Polish Ministry of Health approval. All patients 
provided written informed consent before enrollment. 
The authors had full access to the data and take full respon-
sibility for the completeness and accuracy of the data and the 
analyses reported in this article.
study Patients
Patients with severe degenerative MR resulting from iso-
lated posterior leaflet prolapse were enrolled. Patients were 
selected if the predicted post-ePTFE artificial cord implanta-
tion coaptation surface was adequate to result in effective MR 
reduction in the judgment of the operating surgeon and the 
clinical trial team. This was a qualitative assessment based 
on 2- and 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography 
(TEE) that there was sufficient posterior leaflet tissue area in 
the prolapsed segment to occlude the regurgitant orifice when 
repositioned apically with the ePTFE cords.
Patients were excluded if they had functional MR, a 
Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality (for 
repair) of >6%, severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pul-
monary artery pressure >60 mm Hg), or severe LV dysfunc-
tion (ejection fraction <40%). Full inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT02432196.
Device Design and implantation Procedure
The TSD-5 device (Harpoon Medical, Inc) is a 3-mm-diameter 
shafted instrument designed to anchor ePTFE cords on the 
prolapsed mitral valve leaflet. A small (2–3 cm) anterolateral 
left thoracotomy is performed in the fourth or fifth intercos-
tal space. The pericardium is opened; heparin is administered 
to maintain an activated clotting time of >350 seconds; and 
concentric pledgeted purse-string sutures are placed at the 
insertion site on the epicardium ≈3 to 4 cm basal to the apex 
of the heart (at the level of the base of the papillary muscles) 
and just lateral to the left anterior descending coronary artery. 
A purpose-designed 14F valved introducer is inserted over a 
guidewire into the ventricle and secured. A TSD-5 is inserted 
into the introducer and, with TEE guidance (simultaneous 
orthogonal [x plane] views at midcommissural and long-axis 
planes), is steered to the ventricular surface of the prolapsed 
leaflet. The target site on the prolapsed leaflet is stabilized 
with the device by applying pressure to the ventricular side 
of the leaflet with the end-effector of the device. Once proper 
positioning is confirmed in the orthogonal TEE planes, the 
device is actuated, which results in perforation of the leaflet by 
a specially designed 21-gauge needle wrapped with 50 coils of 
ePTFE in a preformed knot configuration (Figure 1). There is no 
need to grasp or catch the moving leaflet, and sutures are not 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• This report describes an initial clinical experience 
with a new device designed to implant expanded 
polytetrafluoroethylene artificial cords on the pro-
lapsed mitral valve and to correct degenerative 
mitral regurgitation in the beating heart with the 
use of transesophageal echocardiographic image 
guidance.
• The main findings of this study were that in an initial 
11-patient clinical experience, surgeons used the 
device to successfully implant multiple expanded 
polytetrafluoroethylene artificial cords and to effec-
tively reduce mitral regurgitation in all patients.
• The results were stable at 30 days, and the proce-
dure was safe, with no acute conversions to open 
heart surgery, blood transfusions, stroke, or death.
What are the clinical implications?
• This study suggests that the Harpoon TSD-5 has 
the potential to facilitate less invasive beating-heart 
therapy for degenerative mitral regurgitation.
• This initial experience will require follow-up to ensure 
durability and effectiveness in larger numbers of 
patients.

limited to the free edge, allowing the operator to anchor ePTFE 
cords anywhere on the leaflet.
As the needle is automatically withdrawn, a double-helix 
coiled ePTFE knot is formed on the atrial surface of the leaflet, 
securing the associated pair of ePTFE artificial cords to the 
leaflet. The TSD-5 device is withdrawn through the valved intro-
ducer, and the ePTFE cords are exteriorized through the intro-
ducer. Additional TSD-5 devices are deployed to anchor the 
desired number of ePTFE cordal pairs to the leaflet (typically 3 
or 4 pairs). Once insertions are complete, the valved introducer 
is withdrawn and the purse-string suture is tied. The ePTFE 
cords emanating from the ventricle are passed through sepa-
rate holes in a single Teflon pledget and with a tourniquet are 
simultaneously titrated to an optimal length (defined as maxi-
mal coaptation on echocardiography and absent MR on color 
Doppler interrogation) with TEE guidance. Each pair is then tied 
on the single pledget, and the procedure is completed. Movie 
I in the online-only Data Supplement demonstrates the TSD-5 
ePTFE artificial cord implantation procedure. Aspirin (325 mg) 
is administered after the operation and daily thereafter.
study end Points
The prespecified primary performance outcome was proce-
dural success, defined as successful implantation of ≥1 ePTFE 
artificial cords on the mitral valve, and demonstration of MR 
reduction from severe to moderate or less at the conclusion 
of the procedure and at 30 days. The primary safety end point 
was freedom from serious adverse events during the ePTFE 
implantation procedure, at discharge, and at 30 days after the 
procedure. We assessed the severity of MR using intraopera-
tive TEE and predismissal, 30-day, and 6-month transthoracic 
echocardiography. Perioperative mortality was defined as the 
greater of 30-day mortality or in-hospital mortality. Adverse 
events were defined according to the Society of Thoracic 
Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database definitions.2 This 
study represents an interim analysis of an ongoing early-fea-
sibility study. The common date for all analyses was January 
1, 2016. The mean length of follow-up was 186 days (range, 
64–319 days). 
echocardiographic analyses
Echocardiographic analyses were performed independently by 
a core laboratory (Massachusetts General Hospital). LV dimen-
sions, left atrial volumes (biplane area length), and LV volumes 
were measured (biplane method of disks) per American Society 
of Echocardiography chamber quantification guidelines.6 The 
degree of MR was graded as none, trace, mild, moderate, 
or severe (corresponding to numerical grading of 0 to 4+, 
Figure 1. Mitral valve repair using the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePtFe) preformed knot implantation 
device (tsD-5).  
A small anterolateral thoracotomy is performed in the fourth or fifth intercostal space. The valved introducer is inserted into the 
ventricle through a purse-string suture in a location that is 3 to 4 cm basal from the apex and lateral to the left anterior descend-
ing coronary artery. The TSD-5 is steered to the underside of the prolapsed leaflet at the targeted location, and once leaflet sta-
bilization is achieved, the device is actuated, forming a double-helix knot on the atrial surface. Multiple ePTFE cords are anchored 
on the leaflet; the introducer is withdrawn; and the cords are titrated to maximize coaptation and to minimize mitral regurgitation. 
The cords are tied on a Teflon pledget on the epicardium at the insertion site.

Baseline characteristics
From February 2015 through October 2015, 30 pa-
tients were screened and 11 consecutive patients were 
enrolled in the trial. All implanting surgeons were trained 
on a bench-top simulator and in an animal laboratory. 
The mean age of the patients was 65±13 years (range, 
42–89 years), and 91% were men. The baseline char-
acteristics of the patients who underwent beating-heart 
mitral valve repair are shown in Table 1. Most patients 
were low risk for conventional surgical mitral valve re-
pair, and all but 1 patient had class 1 indications for 
mitral valve repair.8
Procedural results
There was a 100% procedural success rate. An average 
of 3.6±0.7 (range, 3–5) pairs of ePTFE artificial cords 
were implanted, with reduction of MR during the proce-
dure from severe to none/trace in 8 patients and to mild 
in 3 patients. Total procedure time averaged 108±30 
minutes (range, 72–167 minutes), and the total time that 
the introducer was in the ventricle averaged 38±14 min-
utes (range, 20–58 minutes). No patient required intra-
operative inotropic or vasopressor support. There was 
no perioperative mortality and no intraoperative conver-
sion to conventional cardiac surgery. There were no peri-
operative strokes, new-onset renal failure, postoperative 
AF, or myocardial infarction. No blood transfusions were 
required during the procedure or hospitalization. At 1 
month, all 4 patients with preoperative paroxysmal AF 
were in sinus rhythm, and 1 patient with preoperative 
persistent AF remained in AF. There were 2 in-hospital 
adverse events: 2 patients required reoperation (subxi-
phoid window) for delayed pericardial effusion on post-
operative days 5 and 13. In both cases, serosanginous 
fluid was evacuated (150 and 500 mL), and both pa-
tients recovered uneventfully and were discharged home 
in good condition.
reoperation
One patient required conventional cardiac surgical op-
eration on postoperative day 72 for recurrent symptom-
atic severe MR. Moderate MR was recognized on the 
predismissal echocardiogram. Recurrent severe MR was 
identified 60 days postoperatively and was associated 
with recurrence of dyspnea. At reoperation, all 3 ePTFE 
knots were intact and located on the atrial surface of 
the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet with evidence 
of early endothelialization (Figure 2). There was no evi-
dence of leaflet damage. One of the 3 pairs of ePTFE 
artificial cords was found to have become untied from 
the epicardial apical pledget, and this end of the suture 
pair was free within the ventricle but remained anchored 
at the knot to the leaflet.
In addition, 1 native edge cord to A2 was ruptured. 
A quadrangular resection incorporating the P2 segment 
of the posterior leaflet and all 3 ePTFE knots was per-
formed with insertion of a size 34 complete semirigid 
annuloplasty ring. An ePTFE cord was placed to A2. The 
patient was discharged from the hospital in good condi-
tion with no MR.

Mr reduction
The severity of MR at the conclusion of the procedure, 
before dismissal, and at 30 days is reported in Table 2. 
Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up was 100% com-
plete. There was no evidence of mitral stenosis at 1 month 
after the procedure, with peak and mean transmitral gradi-
ents of 3.2 and 1.5 mm 
Hg, respectively. Four patients have 
had 6-month follow-up echocardiography. All are in New York 
Heart Association class I. In all cases, the ePTFE artificial 
cords and knots are in stable positions. Three patients 
have none/trace MR, and 1 patient has moderate MR.
echocardiographic results
Preoperative and 30-day echocardiographic measure-
ments are reported in Table 3. 
There was evidence of early ventricular remodeling, 
with a decrease in the end-diastolic dimension of 11% 
(54±3 to 48±5 mm), end-diastolic volumes of 18% 
(142±41 to 116±36 mL), and the septal-lateral dimen-
sion from 40.0 to 37.9 mm. There were no important 
differences in ejection fraction and no wall motion ab-
normalities after the procedure. There was favorable 
early remodeling of the left atrium with a decrease in 
anterior-posterior left atrial dimension and volumes. Fig-
ure 3 demonstrates representative preprocedural and 
postprocedural TEE images, and Figure 4 is a represen-
tative 6-month transthoracic follow-up study.
DiscussiOn
In this study, we describe the initial evaluation of the 
Harpoon ePTFE artificial cord implantation device in a 
first-in-human series of 11 consecutive patients with se-
vere degenerative MR. The device was used to implant 
artificial ePTFE cords in the posterior leaflet of the beat-
ing heart with TEE image guidance. Procedural success 
occurred in all patients, with the insertion of between 3 
and 5 pairs of ePTFE artificial cords resulting in a reduc-
tion in MR from severe to moderate or less in all patients 
at 30 days. MR reduction was stable in 3 of 4 patients 
followed up to 6 months.
Expanded ePTFE sutures were first described for 
use in surgical mitral valve repair by Zussa et al4 and 
introduced clinically by David.9 In a large series of 606 
consecutive patients with degenerative MR repaired 
with ePTFE artificial cords with a mean clinical follow-up 
of 10.1 years, the freedom from recurrent severe MR 
at 18 years was 91% and the freedom from reopera-
tion on the mitral valve was 90%.10 One randomized 
trial compared results of conventional resection tech-
niques with ePTFE cordal replacement techniques and 
found equivalent early results, with evidence of greater 
coaptation surface in the ePTFE group.3 Recent stud-
ies have suggested that LV performance is superior 
in patients with degenerative MR repaired with ePTFE 
artificial cordal techniques compared with resection 
methods.11 In North America, there is increasing use of 
ePTFE in mitral valve repair: Between 2011 and 2014, 
among 20 
523 patients undergoing mitral valve repair 
for degenerative disease, ePTFE cordal replacement 
was used in 31% (6370).2
We reasoned that a shafted instrument with a nar-
row diameter that could reliably anchor ePTFE artificial 
cords to a prolapsed mitral valve leaflet with the use of 
transapical access and TEE guidance would enable reli-
able and durable mitral valve repair through a small non-
sternotomy incision on the beating heart. We found that 
the Harpoon TSD-5 device performed as designed and 
enabled the operator to anchor ePTFE artificial cords 
in precise targeted locations on the prolapsed segment 
of the mitral valve. The procedure was efficient, with an 
average procedural time of 108±30 minutes and an in-
troducer dwell time of 38±14 minutes, and was charac-
terized by complete hemodynamic stability. Transapical 
mitral valve repair with a device designed to grasp the 
free edge of the prolapsed mitral valve leaflet and se-
cure an ePTFE cord (Neochord, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) 
has previously been reported, with intermediate-term re-
sults from patients treated after an initial learning curve 
suggesting a strong safety profile and an effective reduc-
tion in MR.12 Compared with the Neochord device, the 
Harpoon device is characterized by a smaller-diameter 
shaft (3 versus 8 mm), a valved introducer to minimize 
intraprocedural bleeding, the ability to insert the ePTFE 
cords anywhere on the leaflet rather than within 4 mm of 
the free edge, and a fundamentally different anchoring 
mechanism.
One challenge of conventional mitral valve repair 
surgery with ePTFE artificial cords is correct determi-
nation of the optimal length of the ePTFE cords on the 
Figure 2.  early endothelial ingrowth of 2 expanded 
polytetrafluoroethylene (ePtFe) knots on the atrial 
surface of the posterior leaflet.

open and arrested heart. Beating-heart image-guided 
transapical mitral valve repair with the Harpoon TSD-
5 device enabled the surgeon to precisely titrate the 
length of the ePTFE artificial cords in real time on the 
beating, working heart. In all cases, the operator was 
able to tighten or loosen the ePTFE cords to maximize 
leaflet coaptation and to minimize MR. The only intra-
cardiac implant in this procedure is the ePTFE suture 
and knot, analogous to conventional ePTFE-based sur-
gical repair, which has a long clinical record of safety 
and effectiveness. Preclinical testing with fresh human 
autopsy hearts has demonstrated that the Harpoon 
preformed knot has anchoring forces equivalent to 
conventionally sutured ePTFE.
One patient in this initial clinical experience required 
reoperation for recurrent MR. The cause of recurrence 
was multifactorial and included unfastening and de-
tachment of 1 pair of ePTFE cords from the pledget 
on the epicardium; an unrecognized and untreated an-
terior leaflet, which prolapsed 1 to 2 mm above the 
plane of the mitral annulus; and progression of disease 
with rupture of a native anterior leaflet edge cord. Im-
proved surgical training, better methods of securing 
the ePTFE cords to the epicardial pledget, deployment 
of ePTFE cords on the anterior leaflet, and increased 
experience with patient selection based on analysis of 
reconstructed 3-dimensional TEE data sets should all 
contribute to minimizing the likelihood of this type of 
failure in future patients.
It is unlikely that ePTFE knots placed on the mitral 
leaflet with the Harpoon ePTFE cordal implantation de-
vice will compromise subsequent surgical mitral valve 
repair. We found that to be the case in this patient, in 
whom at reoperation the ePTFE knots did not apprecia-
bly change the structure of the mitral valve leaflet at 2 
months after implantation and a resectional repair was 
successful. Although in this case the surgeon chose to 
perform a resectional repair, a nonresectional repair 
would have been equally feasible. This is in contrast to 
experience with the MitraClip device, in which a fibrous 
reaction to the clip commonly precludes subsequent 
successful surgical repair in most patients.13
MR reduction was excellent in all cases, with 30-day 
MR grading of mild or less in all but 2 patients, 1 patient 
who required reoperation and another with evidence of 
modest reprolapse of the posterior leaflet. In the patient 
who developed moderate MR by the 6-month follow-up 
(the second patient ever treated with the device), we 
identified progressive prolapse of a lateral segment of 
P2 that was not targeted for ePTFE resuspension during

the initial procedure. Now that we have gained experi-
ence, in retrospect, we would have specifically targeted 
this segment for ePTFE cord implantation. In the remain-
ing 3 patients with 6 month follow-up, the posterior 
leaflet position was stable with a generous surface of 
coaptation. As expected after successful surgical mitral 
valve repair, the MR reduction was associated with favor-
able LV, mitral annular, and left atrial remodeling, with 
decreases in LV dimensions and volumes, septal-lateral 
mitral annulus dimension, and left atrial volumes.
This initial clinical experience supports the conclu-
sion that surgical-grade MR reduction is possible with 
the device and that the repair is durable at the 1-month 
follow-up. We do not believe that annular dilation per se 
mandates annular downsizing with an annuloplasty ring 
but rather that the key predictor of successful mitral 
valve repair is the ratio of total leaflet tissue to mitral 
orifice area, which if adequate allows sufficient coapta-
tion. The ePTFE artificial cords placed in this experi-
ence are not implanted on the tip of the papillary mus-
cles as in conventional mitral valve surgery but rather 
are inserted through the myocardium on the anterior 
surface of the LV in proximity to the left anterior de-
scending coronary artery. The resulting force vectors 
on the leaflet therefore include both apical and anterior 
forces, the latter of which serves to decrease and sta-

bilize the septal-lateral (anterior-posterior) dimension of 
the mitral annulus.6 Reduction of MR with the Harpoon 
TSD-5 resulted in modest but significant early reduc-
tions in septal-lateral dimensions as a component of 
postprocedural LV remodeling.
Mitral valve repair is clearly superior to replacement 
for degenerative disease, with an operative risk of ap-
proximately half compared with replacement, improved 
LV function, and superior freedom from reoperation, 
structural valvular deterioration, thromboembolism, 
anticoagulation-related complications, and infective en-
docarditis.14,15 Current American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association guidelines indicate mitral 
valve repair in preference to replacement for degen-
erative disease (Class I recommendation) and prohibit 
(Class III: harm) mitral replacement for severe primary 
MR limited to less than one half of the posterior leaf-
let.16 Despite clear evidence of the short- and long-term 
benefits of mitral valve repair for degenerative MR, at 
present, mitral valve repair rates are between 60% and 
85% in North America, and there is substantial variability 
based on center and surgeon experience, reflecting the 
complexity of mitral valve repair for degenerative dis-
ease. As a result of real-time echocardiographic titration 
of ePTFE cordal lengths on the loaded working heart, 
image-guided beating-heart mitral valve repair for degen-
erative disease with the Harpoon TSD-5 has the potential 
to increase mitral valve repair rates.
As expected, transapical beating-heart mitral valve re-
pair had an excellent safety profile, with no perioperative 
mortality and little morbidity. We believe that compared 
with conventional mitral valve surgery, beating-heart mi-
tral valve repair will be associated with a shorter hospi-
tal length of stay, substantially less resource use, and 
faster return to preoperative functional status.
The Harpoon TSD-5 device is suitable for both low-
risk degenerative MR patients (those currently referred 
for surgical therapy) and high- and extreme-risk patients 
who currently are not candidates for conventional sur-
gery. We anticipate continued procedural refinement 
and, as these learnings are implemented, continued im-
provement in clinical results.
This trial did not have a control arm of patients under-
going conventional mitral valve repair surgery; thus, we 
cannot make definitive statements comparing this ap-
proach with conventional mitral valve operation. This re-
port represents an interim analysis of an ongoing study. 
This initial series was limited to patients with posterior 
mitral leaflet prolapse only. However, as additional expe-
rience is achieved, we plan on broadening this approach 
to bileaflet prolapse and complex mitral degenerative 
pathology.
cOnclusiOns
In this first-in-human experience, the Harpoon TSD-5 
enabled less invasive beating-heart image-guided trans-
apical mitral valve repair with 100% procedural success 
and safe and reliable reduction in MR. This initial experi-
ence will require follow-up to ensure durability and effec-
tiveness in larger numbers of patients.
