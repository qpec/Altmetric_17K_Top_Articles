Abstract
Background: Understanding end of life preferences amongst the oldest old is crucial to informing appropriate
palliative and end of life care internationally. However, little has been reported in the academic literature about the end
of life preferences of people in advanced age, particularly the preferences of indigenous older people, including New
Zealand Māori.
Methods: Data on end of life preferences were gathered from 147 Māori (aged >80 years) and 291 non- Māori aged
(>85 years), during three waves of Te Puawaitangi O Nga Tapuwae Kia Ora Tonu, Life and Living in Advanced Age (LiLACs
NZ). An interviewer-led questionnaire using standardised tools and including Māori specific subsections was used.
Results: The top priority for both Māori and non-Māori participants at end of life was ‘not being a burden to my family’.
Interestingly, a home death was not a high priority for either group. End of life preferences differed by gender, however
these differences were culturally contingent. More female Māori participants wanted spiritual practices at end of life than
male Māori participants. More male non-Māori participants wanted to be resuscitated than female non- Māori participants.
Conclusions: That a home death was not in the top three end of life priorities for our participants is not consistent with
palliative care policy in most developed countries where place of death, and particularly home death, is a central concern.
Conversely our participants’ top concern – namely not being a burden – has received little research or policy attention. Our
results also indicate a need to pay attention to diversity in end of life preferences amongst people of advanced age, as well
as the socio-cultural context within which preferences are formulated.

Background
Palliative care policy internationally now prioritises service
provision which is in line with how both individuals, and
wider societies, define ‘good dying’ [1]. Unsurprisingly,
therefore, there is now a growing body of research exam-
ining preferences for end of life care. However, key gaps in
current knowledge and understanding exist regarding end
of life care preferences. In particular, little is known
regarding the preferences of people of ‘advanced age’
,
defined within the gerontology literature as those aged
>85 years [2, 3]. This knowledge gap is limiting the
development of policy appropriate to the needs of ageing
populations internationally [4] because, not only are the
numbers of deaths in the oldest age group rising rapidly in
most developed countries [5], but also the limited research
in this area indicates some unique aspects of care
preferences within this group [6–8].
There has also been a lack of attention to diversity in
preferences amongst the oldest old; for example, explora-
tions of the intersection of age and culture on preferences
for end of life care are rare. In particular we are not aware
of any research that has explicitly explored end of life
preferences amongst indigenous people of advanced age.
Within the New Zealand (NZ) context, the lack of attention
paid to the unique aspirations and needs of indigenous
Māori is highly problematic given that ‘partnership, protec-
tion and participation’ of Māori is enshrined in law. Māori
are less likely to use specialist palliative care services than
NZ Europeans, which may partly reflect a lack of cultural
appropriateness of these services [9, 10], but little research
has explored the unique preferences of Māori for end of life
care. It is within this context that this paper reports
research exploring the end of life (EOL) preferences of

 Māori >80 years and non-Māori >85 years of age. A differ-
ential recruitment age was adopted because disparities in
the burden of chronic disease, reflected in a 7 year differ-
ence in life expectancy [11, 12], mean that Māori are
considered to reach ‘advanced age’ earlier than non-Māori.
Research aim
To explore the end of life care preferences of Māori and
non-Māori of advanced age and identify associations
between preferences and key socio-demographic factors.
Research objectives
1) To describe the EOL preferences of Māori and
non-Māori participants.
2) To examine the relationship between EOL care
preferences and key socio-demographic factors
(gender and culture).
Methods
Study background
Te Puawaitanga o Nga Tapuwae Kia Ora Tonu, Life and
Living in Advanced Age: a Cohort Study in New Zealand
(LiLACS NZ), was set up under joint Māori and non-Māori
leadership to identify predictors of successful ageing, defined
in relation to quality of life, health status, functional inde-
pendence and longevity. Ethical approval for the study was
granted by the Northern X Regional Ethics Committee of
New Zealand. This paper reports findings from a sub-study
of LiLACS NZ which focused specifically upon exploring
the End of Life (EOL) preferences of Māori and non-Māori.
Recruitment
Participants were recruited in 2010 from the Bay of Plenty
and northern part of the Lakes areas of New Zealand,
regions chosen as they contain a proportionately high num-
ber of Māori. In total 1636 eligible participants (766 Māori
and 870 non-Māori) were identified via the NZ General
and Māori electoral rolls (n = 1564) (in NZ adults are
required by law to register for these rolls), from general
practices (n = 46), by word of mouth (n = 22), from residen-
tial care (n = 3) and by advertisement (n = 1). Of these, 937
participants were enrolled in LiLACS NZ: 421 participants
were Māori (55% of total eligible) and 516 were non-Māori
(59% of total eligible). The formal criteria for eligibility for
LiLACS NZ were non-Māori born between 1 January and
31 December 1925 (aged 85 in 2010), and Māori born
between 1 January 1920 and 31 December 1930 (aged 80 to
90 in 2010). Those meeting the age criteria needed to have
been living within the recruitment areas during the 2010
enrolment year. Using 2006 census data with projections to
2010 the sex and age distribution of Māori participants was
consistent with the general population; for non-Māori,
more men than would be expected were recruited (LiLACS
NZ 48% vs census 42%) [13]. An extensive community
consultation process identified local and tribal bodies to
conduct the study fieldwork; participants were followed up
across six yearly administrations (waves). Participants
undertook either a full questionnaire or six pages of core
questions. Predictors of attrition included: death, ill-health
and loss of interest [7]. The questionnaires were adminis-
tered face-to-face by trained interviewers offered as home
visits or at another site chosen by the participant.
Questionnaire
A full description of the questionnaire contents is provided
elsewhere [14]. Culturally specific questions were developed
by the researchers, a te RoopuKaitiaki o nga tikanga Māori
[caregiver/guidance] Group of Māori elders and drew on
the Te Whāre Tapa Whā model of health [15]. The
questionnaire was translated into Te Reo Māori (Māori
language) appropriate to the region of study. Pertinent to
the current study the following measures were included:
Socio-demographic questions
Socio-demographic characteristics collected (Wave 1) in-
cluded age, gender and marital status as well as length of
time widowed, separated or divorced. Level of education
achieved and standard of living questions were drawn from
9the New Zealand Census (2006) and Health Work and
Retirement Study/New Zealand and the Longitudinal
Study of Ageing (NZLSA) questionnaire [16] respectively.
Family relationship questions (e.g. brothers, sisters, sons
and daughters) were adapted from the Newcastle 85+
study protocols [17].
End of life preferences
EOL questions were introduced in Wave 3 with the End
of Life (EOL) tool. The questionnaire drew on questions
ranking the importance of various factors to a ‘good
death’ developed by Waghorn, Young and Davies (2011),
and the VOICES questionnaire [18, 19]. Participants first
answered the question: “Are you comfortable talking
about your plan for the end of life?” (yes/no) Participants
who agreed then answered seven questions related to
their EOL planning in a dichotomous (yes/no) format.
This section included questions related to Living Will or
Advanced Care Plans (e.g. Enduring Power of Attorney,
resuscitation
status,
medical
intervention
status),
whether they had spoken to a relative regarding their
wishes and whether or not there would be spiritual
practices performed while dying. Participants were also
asked to rate the importance of twelve end-of-life
spiritual, cultural and practical end of life preferences
(e.g. to have pain/symptoms controlled, to be at peace
with God) on a scale from 1 “not important” to 5
“extremely important.” [14].

 Analysis
Quantitative data were coded into SPSS version 22. Both de-
scriptive (frequencies, percentages) and inferential statistics
appropriate to the level of measurement (Chi-square x2)
were employed. The five-point EOL preferences items were
collapsed into three categories: 1 “not important”, 2 (com-
bined 2 + 3) “moderately important”, and 3 “very important”
(combined 4 + 5). Small sample sizes required the collapsing
of categories to obtain the recommended expected value of
five cases per contingency table cell for chi-square analyses
[20]. Ranking of importance of each preference item repre-
sents the valid percent reporting the item as “very import-
ant”. Valid percent was utilised to adjust for differences in
total number of responses on each preference item, thereby
allowing for comparison between items. Education and
marital status variables were analysed as dichotomous
categories, (no school qualification/school qualification) and
(married/not married).
Presentation of results
In terms of results presentation, the principle of ‘equal
explanatory power’ supports the inclusion of equal numbers
of Māori and non-Māori participants in all health research
[21]. Adopting this principle demands separate analyses of
data for Māori and non-Māori with equal power [22]. Thus
side by side comparisons should not be conducted. As
stated by Nazroo [21] side by side comparisons could
contribute to the ‘racialisation’ of health issues “by identify-
ing the health disadvantage of ethnic minority groups as
inherent to their ethnicity, a consequence of their cultural
and genetic ‘weaknesses’ rather than a result of the
disadvantage they face because of the ways in which their
ethnicity or race is perceived by others.” (p.215) We also
are cognisant of the differing age criteria for the two
groups, complicating comparative analyses.
Results
In Wave One 421 persons identified as Māori, while 516
identified as non- Māori. In Wave 3, 438 (147 Māori and
291 non-Māori) participants responded “yes” to a question
asking whether they were comfortable with discussing
EOL issues (Table 1) and completed the seven end of life
planning questions, representing 76% of total Wave 3
Māori participants and 86% of total Wave 3 non- Māori
participants [22].
Wave 3 sample representativeness
According to Kerse et al. [22] compared to Wave 1, Wave 3
participants were more likely to: have been independent in
activities of daily living (ADLs); be less deprived [New Zea-
land Deprivation Index score (NZdep)[19]; had fewer health
conditions; and had a decreased likelihood of depression at
baseline than those who did not complete Wave 3. Please
see Kerse et al. [22] for further cohort comparisons.
EOL respondents
Utilising chi-square test of independence, there were no
significant differences (p > .05) between the participants
who answered yes to the comfort in discussing EOL
question and those who did not (n = 21) based on gender
X2(1, n = 459) =8.44, p = .004; ethnicity Māori (y/n) X2(1,

ried) X2(1, n = 459) =6.31, p = .012; education (education/no

stances (alone/not alone) X2(1, n = 456) = 0.84, p = .358.
Socio-demographic characteristics
The socio-demographic characteristics of the partici-
pants who answered “yes” to the question related to
comfort in discussing end-of-life plans and preferences
are listed in Table 1.
Māori
Over half of the participants were female (61.2%) most
often (69.4%) under the age of 87. Participants were
most often widows/widowers (57.8%) and lived alone
(10.8%). Home was most often described as a private
dwelling (36.7%) and participants most often reported
not utilising Support Services (e.g. cleaning, shopping or
personal care assistance) (61.3%).
Non-Māori
Non-Māori participants were also predominantly female
(49.5%) and over the age of 87 (100%). Like Māori
participants, non-Māori participants were most often
(56.4%) widows/widowers and lived alone (51.5%). Add-
itionally, private dwelling was most often (54.6%) se-
lected for home description. Slightly more participants
reported using Support Services (53.7%) than not using
Support Services (46.3%).

More women than men had talked to a family member
about EOL wishes X2(1, n = 147) = 6.05, p = .014 and
more women than men reported planning for spiritual
practices at the EOL X2(1, n = 139) =6.85, p = .009,

Non-Māori
More men than women reported a wish to have major sur-
gery or medical intervention X2 (1, n = 126) =8.22, p = .004.
Similarly, more men than women reported a desire to be
resuscitated X2(1, n = 130) = 4.26, p = .039. More women

Gender differences in responses to the 12 EOL prefer-
ences questions indicated that more women than men
had a preference “to be at peace with God” X2(2, n = 144)
= 9.77, p = .008. There were no other significant differ-
ences in EOL preferences based on gender (p > .05),
(Table 4).
Non-Māori
Chi-square tests of independence were performed to
examine the relationship between gender and the list of
12 EOL preferences. Women more often than men
rated pain and symptom control X2(2, n = 276) = 13.65,

be a burden to society X2(2, n = 288) = 18.52, p < .0001
as “very important”, (Table 5).
Discussion
Understanding end of life priorities is a critical element
of ensuring high quality palliative and end of life care.
This study provides new information regarding the end
of life priorities of people in advanced age, amongst
whom demand for palliative care is predicted to increase
exponentially in coming decades. In particular, we have
shown that priorities for care differ from published data
regarding the priorities of young old people who are
typically in good health [23], and that there are also
significant differences in end of life care priorities by key
socio-demographic factors and notably, amongst Māori
and non-Māori participants and men and women.
Our findings also highlight the importance of considering
the end of life preferences of older people within the
context of the pervasive ageism experienced in many
countries internationally and the low societal value placed
on old age [24]. For example, both Māori and non-Māori
participants ranked ‘not being a burden’ as their top priority
at end of life. This confirms previous qualitative studies
with older people [4, 25–27], as well as quantitative
research with ‘terminally ill’ people of all ages, of whom
19–65% are estimated to experience some form of self-
perceived burden [28]. That such concerns may be particu-
larly marked amongst older people is unsurprising given
evidence that the negative societal framing of ageing popu-
lations has fed into older people’s perceptions that they are
‘a burden’ [29]. In addition, previous research has indicated
that the perception of being a burden to others is a factor
that underlies many requests for assisted dying among
patients with life-limiting illnesses [30–32]. This current
findings have important practice and policy implications in
relation to debates surrounding this issue [33].
These findings also lend weight to the argument that
older people’s end of life preferences are not well
explained by the Western individualistic model of bioethics
[34, 35] that underpins much palliative care policy and
practice, but rather fit better with a more relational ‘ethics
of care’ model [36] which is based on the social connected-
ness, and “total care” of a person [37]. For older Māori it is
likely that their aroha (love, care, compassion) acts to pro-
tect whānau already burdened with economic hardship
from being further encumbered with the high financial
costs associated with end of life care [38].

 It is also important to highlight that a home death did
not feature in the top three end of life care priorities for
either Māori or non-Māori participants. Such findings
lend further weight to the need to revisit normative
understandings that a ‘good death’ must occur at home
[39], understandings which permeate palliative care
policy internationally (for example, [40–42]. Our partici-
pants identified that pain and symptom control, attend-
ing to spiritual concerns (for Māori) and ‘getting affairs
in order’ (for non-Māori) were more important than the
actual place of dying. These latter two concerns are
rarely given full consideration in policy or practice [43],
with spirituality, in particular, often poorly attended to [44].
In New Zealand, in line with the principle of active protec-
tion of Te Tiriti o Waitangi (Treaty of Waitangi), there is an
urgent need to consider ways to ensure spiritual require-
ments are understood and respected so that Māori dying in
advanced age are able to exert tino rangatiratanga (self-de-
termination) in their end of life journey.
A recent review drew attention to the failure of palliative
care research to adequately address the influence of gender
on end of life circumstances [45]. This study further
confirms that this influence is pervasive, but culturally
contingent, as the effect of gender on end of life priorities
differed
for
Māori
and
non-Māori
participants.
For
example, female Māori participants were more likely to
prioritise spiritual practices at end of life than male Māori
participants. Māori women were also more likely to have
talked with family about end of life preferences than had
men. This may reflect the culturally specific tribal role of
Māori women to attend their ill and dying [46]. While
gender may play a role in the reported differences, for
Māori the source of difference is largely informed by
culture, whakapapa (genealogical/relational connections to
the ill and dying) and wairuatanga (spirituality) [47].
The influence of gender on end of life care preferences
and priorities was even more marked for non-Māori
participants, with more men than women expressing a
preference for medical intervention and resuscitation.
Earlier research has also indicated less desire for life-
sustaining treatments for women than men [48, 49]. One
possible explanation is the lower proportion of older
women who have available family and whānau to care for
them when compared to men [50], but findings might also

 point to the potential impact of both ageism and sexism
upon the ways in which older women make end of life deci-
sions. End of life preferences for NZ Europeans appear to
be highly gendered, a finding with important practical im-
plications for practice and policy and which deserves far
greater exploration given the lack of gender analyses con-
ducted in palliative care research to date [45].
For Māori, cultural practices provide both spiritual and
physical connections. These connections with whānau, the
land, ancestors and with a force greater than self, provide
both strength and comfort for the journey to come [44].
Tikanga (cultural customs, values, and practices) “serve as
markers of identity and more importantly are about con-
necting whānau members with the person dying, as well
as with each other” [51] (p. 48). This need for connection
is reflected in the reported EOL planning questions
related to speaking to a family member about EOL wishes.
Limitations
Whilst these data make a unique contribution to existing
knowledge and understanding, certain limitations must
be acknowledged. Firstly, there was attrition over the five
years of the LiLACS NZ study with the loss of more
Māori than non-Māori (10%–12%) [7]. The availability of
alternative sources of data for outcomes mitigates this
limitation to some extent [7]. For those participants
offered the opportunity to respond to the end-of-life ques-
tions
in
Wave
3,
non-completion
was
related
to
participant comfort in discussing end of life concerns.
This resulted in reduced numbers of responses to some
items (e.g. number of Māori respondents to ‘Planning’
questions) which may impact on the generalizability of
these results. However, no significant differences in demo-
graphic characteristics between responders and non-
responders were identified. This finding is also interesting
in and of itself as it supports previous research indicating
that some older people prefer to adopt a ‘closed awareness’
attitude towards death [52] and do not welcome a discus-
sion of end of life preferences. Rather, not talking about
dying and living ‘day-to-day’ represents a coping strategy
[53], something which is important to remember given
policy drives in many countries to increase end of life dis-
cussions, for example through Advance Care Planning
(e.g. [40]. Indeed, this stance does not fit well with policy
directives that regard such a discussion as a quality indica-
tor of good end of life care (e.g. [40, 41].
Use of self-report questionnaire with Māori participants
may be subject to cultural variations in response style. Indi-
viduals of different cultural backgrounds may use answer
response scales in different ways [54]. A more qualitative
approach that takes into account culturally specific require-
ments may yield greater depth of understanding of Māori
EOL preferences [55]. There is an obvious wairua [spiritual]
connection when a Māori person talks about death and
dying. Research by MacDonald (2016) found that partici-
pants who were more connected to ‘being Māori’ tended to
have a greater sense or awareness of their spirituality [56].
This may have also influenced willingness to discuss end of
life preferences. Other demographic variables in addition to
gender and culture may also have contributed to differences
in plans and preferences noted in this study. For example,
Māori health literacy scores have been reported to be lower
than non- Māori [57] which may affect choices and prefer-
ences for care at the end-of-life. [58, 59].

 Conclusion
Overall, findings highlight the need to attend to not only
the nature of end of life preferences for people in advanced
age, but also the socio-cultural context within which these
are formulated. This context has not previously been inves-
tigated in any detail. However, our findings indicate the
need for more research, particularly in relation to the ways
in which cultural identity and gender shape end of life care
preferences. Such research is crucial to achieving the goal
of meeting end of life preferences at end of life for all
people of advanced age.
