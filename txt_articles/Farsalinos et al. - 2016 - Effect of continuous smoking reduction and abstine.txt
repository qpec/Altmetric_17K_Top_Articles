Abstract
We present prospective blood pressure (BP)
and hear rate (HR) changes in smokers invited to switch to
e-cigarettes in the ECLAT study. BP and HR changes were
compared among (1) different study groups (users of high,
low, and zero nicotine products) and (2) pooled continuous
smoking phenotype classification (same phenotype from
week 12 to -52), with participants classified as quitters
(completely quit smoking), reducers (C50 % reduction in
smoking consumption) and failures (
\
50 % or no reduction
in smoking consumption). Additionally, the latter com-
parison was repeated in a subgroup of participants with
elevated BP at baseline. No significant changes were
observed among study groups for systolic BP, diastolic BP,
and HR. In 145 subjects with a continuous smoking phe-
notype, we observed lower systolic BP at week 52 com-
pared to baseline but no effect of smoking phenotype
classification. When the same analysis was repeated in 66
subjects with elevated BP at baseline, a substantial reduc-
tion in systolic BP was observed at week 52 compared to
baseline
(132.4 ± 12.0
vs.
141.2 ± 10.5 mmHg,
p \ 0.001), with a significant effect found for smoking
phenotype classification. After adjusting for weight change,
gender and age, reduction in systolic BP from baseline at
week 52 remains associated significantly with both smok-
ing reduction and smoking abstinence. In conclusion,
smokers who reduce or quit smoking by switching to
e-cigarettes may lower their systolic BP in the long term,
and this reduction is apparent in smokers with elevated BP.
The current study adds to the evidence that quitting
smoking with the use of e-cigarettes does not lead to higher
BP values, and this is independently observed whether
e-cigarettes are regularly used or not.

Introduction
Cigarette smoking is the single most important cause of
preventable premature mortality in the world [1]. It is
responsible for 50 % of all avoidable deaths in smokers,
half of these due to cardiovascular disease [2]. It has been
estimated that the 10-year fatal cardiovascular risk is
doubled in smokers, while for young smokers the risk for
myocardial infarction is up to fivefold higher compared to
non-smokers [2, 3, 4]. The risk associated with smoking is

 primarily related to the amount of tobacco smoked daily,
and shows a clear dose–response relationship with no lower
limit for deleterious effects [5, 6].
The interaction between smoking and blood pressure
(BP) is complex. Smoking causes an immediate elevation
of BP and heart rate (HR) due to stimulation of the
sympathetic nervous system [7]. However, there is con-
troversy over the independent chronic effect of smoking
on BP [8, 9]. In fact, epidemiological studies show that
smoking cessation may be associated with an elevated
risk for future development of hypertension, which has
been attributed to weight gain [10, 11, 12]. In already
established hypertension, smoking is associated with an
elevated risk for cardiovascular disease; thus quitting
smoking is unquestionably among the most important
steps patients with elevated BP can take to improve their
cardiovascular health [13, 14] [15]. Surprisingly, how-
ever, data on the long-term effects of smoking cessation
or reduction on BP (and HR) is very limited, and results
are unclear, with studies reporting lower, higher or
unchanged BP values in smokers compared with non-
smokers [16].
Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are an alternative source of
nicotine, sharing many similarities with smoking in the
behavioural aspect of use [17, 18]. Users are predominantly
smokers, who report using the electronic cigarettes long
term to reduce cigarette consumption or quit smoking, to
relieve tobacco withdrawal symptoms, and to continue
having a ‘smoking’ experience but with much reduced
health risks [19, 20, 21]. Data from two recent prospective
randomised controlled trials show that ECs can aid smok-
ing cessation and reduction [22, 23].
Herein, we present the effects of smoking reduction
and abstinence on resting blood pressure (BP) and heart
rate
(HR)
from
the
ECLAT
study—a
prospective
12-month double-blind, controlled, randomised clinical
three-arm trial designed to evaluate smoking reduction,
smoking abstinence and adverse events in apparently
healthy smokers not intending to quit after switching to a
popular EC brand (‘Categoria’; Arbi Group Srl, Italy).
[23] Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were
compared amongst (1) different study groups (users of
high, low, and zero nicotine products) and (2) pooled
continuous smoking phenotype classification, with par-
ticipants classified as quitters (completely quit smoking),
reducers (C50 % reduction in smoking consumption) and
failures (
\
50 % or no reduction in smoking consump-
tion). The latter comparison was repeated in a subgroup
of participants with abnormal elevated BP at baseline, to
examine the possibility of BP reduction, which would be
unlikely to be observed in participants with normal BP at
baseline.
Methods
Details of participants’ characteristics and study design
have been previously described [23]. The ethics review
board (ERB) of the ‘‘Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele’’
Hospitals approved the study in June 1, 2010, and partic-
ipants gave written informed consent prior to participation.
The clinicaltrial.gov team subsequently approved the
study. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related
trials for this drug/intervention are registered. The smokers
were recruited during the period June 2010–February 2011
with a final follow-up visit at week 52. The trial registry
describes the trial as observational, with a 24-week follow-
up, but was conducted as a three-arm RCT with a 52-week
follow-up because we decided to monitor the long-term
impact of different nicotine levels on smoking cessation or
reduction, BP and HR. This is a post hoc analysis, since BP
and HR were not officially among the primary or secondary
outcomes of trial in the registry entry, but were considered
important as safety indicators.
Participants
Regular smokers not intending to quit were invited to try
ECs (‘‘Categoria’’, Arbi Group Srl, Italy) as a less harmful
alternative to tobacco smoke that could be freely used as a
complete substitute for conventional cigarettes. Subjects
were made aware that the purpose of the current assess-
ment was to quantify reductions in cigarette consumption
by switching to EC use, and the impact on their resting BP
and HR on a regular basis at follow-up visits. No financial
incentive was offered for participation.
Inclusion criteria were: (1) smoke C10 tobacco cigar-
ettes per day (cig/day), for at least the past 5 years, (2) age
18–70 years, (3) in good general health; (4) not currently
attempting to quit smoking or wishing to do so in the next
30 days and (5) committed to follow the trial procedures.
Exclusion criteria were: (1) history of cardiovascular
disease, respiratory disease, psychiatric disorder or major
depression; (2) regular medication use; (3) current or past
history of alcohol abuse; (4) use of smokeless tobacco or
nicotine
replacement
therapy,
and
(5)
pregnancy
or
breastfeeding.
Study design
Eligible
participants
were
enrolled
in
a
prospective
12-month randomised, controlled trial consisting of nine
office visits at the University Hospital’s smoking cessation
clinic (Centro per la Prevenzione e Cura del Tabagismo -
CPCT; Universita
` di Catania, Italy). A prospective evalu-
ation of conventional cigarettes consumption, BP and HR
86
Intern Emerg Med (2016) 11:85–94
123
 was carried out at nine time points (baseline and eight
follow-up visits at week 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 52).
Participants were randomised into three study arms to
receive an e-cigarette kit with either ‘‘Original’’ (2.4 %
nicotine—Group A), or ‘‘Categoria’’ (1.8 % nicotine—
Group
B),
or
‘‘Original’’
without
nicotine
(‘‘sweet
tobacco’’ aroma—Group C) cartridges (Fig. 1). The ran-
domization sequence was computer generated, and blind-
ing was ensured by the identical external appearance of the
cartridges.
At baseline (visit 1), socio-demographic factors, smok-
ing history, Fagerstro
¨m Test for cigarette dependence
(FTCD) scores and levels of carbon monoxide in exhaled
breath—eCO (Micro CO, Micro Medical Ltd, UK) were
annotated. Additionally, BP, HR, and body weight were
recorded.
Participants were then given a free e-cigarette kit with a
full supply of cartridges, and were trained on how to cor-
rectly use the product. They were told to use the study
product ad libitum (but up to a maximum of four car-
tridges/day) in the anticipation of reducing cigarette
smoking, and to take notes of the daily consumption of
conventional cigarettes and cartridge use in their study
diaries.
Participants were then invited to return to the CPCT at
follow-up visits (visits 2–7) to: (1) receive further free
supply of cartridges (with the exception of visit 7) together
with the study diaries for the residual study periods, (2)
record their eCO levels, (3) have their BP and HR mea-
sured, and (4) return completed study diaries and unused
study products. At the end of study visit 7, no more
cartridges were provided by the investigators, but partici-
pants were advised to continue using their EC if they
wished to do so. Body weight was also measured at this
visit.
Study participants attended two additional follow-up
visits at week 24 (visit 8) and at week 52 (visit 9) to report
product use and the number of cigarettes per day smoked,
and to re-check eCO levels. Resting BP, HR, and body
weight were recorded again.
Office BP and HR measurements
For office systolic and diastolic BP measurements, we
followed the methods recommended by the Seventh Report
of the Joint National Committee on prevention, detection,
evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure [24]. After
a 5-minute rest, BP and HR measurements were obtained
by a semi-automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer
(Smart Pressure, CA-MI Snc, Parma, Italy). Two mea-
surements in the sitting position, spaced 1–2 min apart,
were obtained at each visit. Measurements were taken late
in the morning, and participants were asked not to smo-
ke/vape or consume caffeinated drinks for at least 30 min
prior to each visit. The average of two measurements was
considered for analysis.
Products tested
The ‘‘Categoria’’ EC (model ‘‘401’’) was used in this study.
It is a three-piece model that closely resembles a conven-
tional cigarette, activated by a rechargeable 3.7 V-90 mAh
Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of the ECLAT study design. Smokers not
currently attempting to quit smoking or wishing to do so in the next
30 days were randomised in three study groups: group A (receiving
12 weeks of 2.4 % ‘‘Original’’ nicotine cartridges), group B (receiv-
ing 6 weeks of 2.4 % ‘‘Original’’ nicotine cartridges and a further
6 weeks with 1.8 % ‘‘Categoria’’ nicotine cartridges), and group C
(receiving 12 weeks of no-nicotine ‘‘Original’’ cartridges). Partici-
pants in each group were prospectively reviewed for up to 52 weeks
during which smoking habits, eCO levels, BP, HR and body weight
were assessed at each study visits

were of three different types, but of identical appearance:
2.4 % ‘‘Original’’ (2.27 ± 0.13 % nicotine), 1.8 % ‘‘Cat-
egoria’’ (1.71 ± 0.09 % nicotine) and ‘‘Original’’ without
nicotine (‘‘sweet tobacco’’ aroma). Detailed toxicology and

carried in a laboratory certified by the Italian Institute of

ria’’ EC kit and cartridges were provided free of charge by
the local distributor, Arbi Group Srl, Italy.
Smoking phenotypes
Smoking abstinence was defined as complete self-reported
abstinence from tobacco smoking (not even a puff) since
the previous study visit, which was biochemically verified
by eCO levels of B7 ppm. Smokers in this category are
classified as quitters. Smoking reduction was defined as
sustained self-reported C50 % reduction in the number of
cig/day from baseline (eCO levels were measured to verify
smoking status and confirm a reduction compared to
baseline) [25]. Smokers in this category are classified as
reducers. Smokers who were not categorised in the above
categories were classified as failures. The study analysed
the effects of BP and HR among continuous smoking
phenotypes, which was defined as having the same phe-
notype from week 12 to 52. Given that long-term changes
in BP and HR may become apparent only some time after
the change in smoking phenotype, the analysis was per-
formed among participants who had a sustained smoking
phenotype for at least 40 weeks.
Statistical analyses
In our primary analysis, BP and HR values were compared
among the study groups (Group A, B, and C: per-protocol
analysis). Descriptive data are presented as mean ± stan-
dard deviation (SD) or medians and interquartile range (IQ)
for normally and not normally distributed variables,
respectively. Baseline differences between groups were
evaluated by v2 test for categorical variables, and one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher protected LSD
for parametric variables; Kruskall–Wallis test was used for
non-parametric variables. Repeated measures ANOVA was
used to assess changes in systolic BP, diastolic BP and HR
from baseline to wek-52, with time as within subject and
study group as between subject factors.
In our secondary analysis, BP and HR values were
compared among continuous smoking phenotypes, com-
bining datasets from study groups A, B and C (pooled
analysis). To evaluate differences at baseline among
phenotypes, v2 test, one-way ANOVA, and Fisher’s least
significance difference, and Kruskall–Wallis test were used.
Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess changes in
systolic BP, diastolic BP and HR, with time (2 time points,
baseline and week 52) as within subject and continuous
smoking phenotypes (3 phenotypes) as between subject
factors. Given that it was improbable (and clinically
insignificant) to detect improvements in subjects with nor-
mal BP at baseline, the same comparisons were repeated in a
subgroup of participants with elevated BP at baseline. These
were defined as having high-normal or higher BP values
(systolic BP C130 mmHg or diastolic BP C85 mmHg) [15].
To assess whether continuous smoking phenotypes were
associated with changes in BP from baseline to week 52, a
linear regression analysis was performed. The difference in
BP
between
baseline
and
week
52
(DBP = week
52-baseline BP) was introduced as dependent variable, and
continuous smoking phenotype, age, gender and weight
change were introduced as independent factors.
The analyses were carried out using Statistical Package
for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) for Windows
version 20.0 and two-tailed p values of \
0.05 were con-
sidered significant.
Results
After screening 417 subjects, a total of 300 (190 males)
regular smokers (190 males) were eligible and consented to
participate in the study. The baseline characteristics of the
participants per study group are presented in Table 1.
Baseline characteristics were similar among study groups
A, B, and C, with the exception of participants’ age. No
difference was observed in systolic BP, diastolic BP, and
HR at baseline.
Two hundred and twenty-five subjects (75.0 %) returned
at week 12, 211 (70.3 %) at week 24, and 183 (61.0 %) at
week 52 for the final follow-up visit. Baseline character-
istics of those who were lost to follow-up were not sig-
nificantly different from participants who completed the
study (with the exception of gender; males were 58 %
among subjects present at week 52 visit and 71 % among
those lost to follow-up, p = 0.03), and no significant dif-
ference was observed in drop-out rates among study groups
at any study visit.
Overall, reduction and quit rates (%) in the ECLAT
study were not significantly different among study groups.
In particular, at week 52 the quit rates were 13 % in Group
A, 9 % in Group B, and 4 %in Group C. More details about
success rates and tolerability with ECs have been reported
in the ECLAT study [23]. The time trends of systolic BP,
diastolic BP, and HR (in % of baseline value) from all

 participants that were examined at each follow-up visit are
presented in Fig. 2. A slight but significant decrease in
systolic BP was found at week 52 (123.1 ± 13.8 mmHg)
with respect to baseline (128.0 ± 15.3 mmHg, p = 0.004).
No significant effect of study groups was observed in any
of the parameters.

 Among the 183 subjects who completed the follow-up
visit at week 52, 145 had a continuous smoking phenotype
from week 12 to week 52. The baseline characteristics of
these participants are illustrated in Table 2. A small but
statistically significant reduction in systolic BP was
observed at week 52 compared to baseline (122.6 ± 13.3
vs. 126.0 ± 15.6 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.001); no
effect of smoking phenotype classification was evident.
Also, a small reduction in diastolic BP was observed at
week
52
compared
to
baseline
(75.2 ± 9.4
vs.
76.7 ± 9.9 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.02). No significant
change
in
HR
was
observed
(81.2 ± 13.0
vs
80.1 ± 11.8 beats/min, p = NS).
From the subjects with continuous smoking phenotypes,
66 had elevated BP at baseline. When the above-mentioned
analysis was repeated in these subjects, a statistically sig-
nificant reduction in systolic BP was observed at week 52
compared
to
baseline
(132.4 ± 12.0
vs.
141.2 ±
10.5 mmHg, respectively, p \ 0.001). A significant effect
is found for the continuous smoking phenotype classifica-
tion, with quitters exhibiting the highest systolic BP
reduction (16.3 ± 11.3 mmHg, p = 0.005), while Reduc-
ers and Failures show reductions of 10.8 ± 10.1 and
6.0 ± 12.5 mmHg, p \ 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively
(Fig. 3). A significant reduction in diastolic BP was also
observed at week 52 compared to baseline (77.6 ± 10.2 vs.
82.5 ± 9.8 mmHg, p = 0.001). No change in HR is found
(79.3 ± 13.5
vs.
82.7 ± 14.5 beats/min,
respectively,
p = NS). No effect of smoking phenotype classification is
evident for both diastolic BP and HR. No significant dif-
ference in BP changes from baseline is observed in quitters
who stop using EC compared to quitters who still use EC
(combined for groups A–C).
Of note, changes in body weight from baseline diff
among smoking phenotype classifications. Quitters show a
small but statistically significant increase in mean body
weight from 74.7 ± 12.5 kg at baseline to 75.3 ± 13.5 at
week 52 (p = 0.038), while no significant changes are
observed in reducers or failures. After adjusting for weight
change, gender and age, the mean reduction in systolic BP
from baseline at week 52 remains associated significantly
with both smoking reduction (p = 0.046 for reducers) and
smoking abstinence (p = 0.003 for quitters) (Table 3). The
b coefficient for quitters is more that twofold greater in
absolute value compared to reducers.

 Discussion
This is the first study to investigate long-term changes in
BP and HR in smokers who reduce or quit smoking by
using ECs in a randomised control trial. Success rates (i.e.,
C50 % smoking reduction from baseline and complete
abstinence from tobacco smoking) have been reported in
the ECLAT study [23]. Herein, we describe a statistically
significant reduction in systolic BP at week 52 in partici-
pants with elevated BP at baseline, which is associated
with smoking reduction or abstinence even after adjusting
for confounding factors. Moreover, similar changes in BP
from baseline are observed in quitters who stopped using
ECs compared to quitters who still use ECs.
Given the well-established effect of smoking on acute
vasopressor and tachycardic responses and increased arte-
rial stiffness, the observed reduction in systolic BP after
long-lasting smoking reduction or abstinence is not sur-
prising [26–28]. Nonetheless, the epidemiological evidence
is not unequivocal, with some studies showing lower BP
values in smokers compared with non-smokers, others
reporting no association between smoking habit and blood
pressure], and a few others showing that smoking is asso-
ciated with high BP [29–35]. The current study, which
evaluated the effect of a continuous smoking phenotype for
40 weeks (week 12 to 52) on BP, adds to the evidence that
quitting does not lead to higher BP values, and this is
observed independently of whether ECs are regularly used
or not. Population studies have important methodological
limitations that may predispose to heterogeneous results.
First, these studies rely on self-reported tobacco use and
casual collection of BP measurements. Second, because of
their cross-sectional design, the observed relationship
between levels of smoking and changes in BP does not
imply causation. Last but not least, there is the possibility
that such studies do not take into account other population
characteristics (e.g., age, gender, weight increase, caffeine
and alcohol intake), which may play a crucial role when
determining potential causation. Moreover, these observa-
tional studies were conducted more than 30 years ago, and
it is possible that confounders and cut-off limits in partic-
ular, might not be valid at the present time. Indeed, the
impact of chronic cigarette smoking on BP assessed in a
recent cross-sectional study of 33,860 randomly selected
adults shows that older male smokers (
[
45 years old) have
d higher systolic (but not diastolic) BP compared to non-
smokers when adjusted for age, body mass index, social
class, and alcohol intake [9].
Although smoking is not currently considered a risk
factor for the development of hypertension, the impact of
smoking cessation in patients with elevated or high-normal
blood pressure has not been studied adequately (for
example, in interventional prospective trials) [15]. In the
present randomised controlled trial, a small reduction in BP
at week 52 compared to baseline is observed in the whole
study population, but no effect of smoking phenotype
classification is found. This is not surprising, because it is
highly unlikely to detect improvements in smokers with no
history of hypertension, and with a normal BP at baseline.
Moreover, it is unlikely that any reduction observed in
subjects with baseline normal BP is of clinical significance.
Although none of the participants was diagnosed as
hypertensive, a proportion of them had high-normal or
higher BP levels at baseline. In this subgroup of 66
smokers, a more substantial reduction in systolic and
diastolic BP at week 52 is observed, with a significant
effect now being found for smoking phenotype classifica-
tion. The findings are important since it is well-established
that high-normal BP is a risk factor for future development
of hypertension, and is associated with an increased risk of
myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease [36, 37].
Mild BP elevations have also been associated with an
increased thickness of the carotid media and intima, altered
cardiac morphological features and left ventricular dias-
tolic dysfunction [38–40]. Lifestyle changes are recom-
mended in these cases, among which smoking cessation is
particularly important. It is, therefore, reassuring that in our
smoking cessation study both reducers and quitters have
higher reductions in systolic bp compared to failures. the
much stronger association observed in quitters, indicates

 that complete smoking abstinence provides greater benefit
compared to smoking reduction.
Of note, the observed reduction in systolic BP
remains
significantly
associated
with
both
smoking
reduction and smoking abstinence even after adjusting
for age, gender, and weight change in the multiple
linear regression analysis. Given the trivial weight gain
in quitters at week 52 (only about 0.6 kg), this was not
surprising. The observed weight gain is much lower
than that reported in the literature [41, 42], despite the
fact that quitters were classified based on continuous
abstinence over 40 weeks. This suggests that the com-
bination of nicotine delivery and replacement of the
rituals associated with smoking behaviour during ECs
use might have been the cause for the observed weight
gain mitigation in quitters.
In agreement with the findings from other research
groups, positive improvements in systolic BP after smok-
ing cessation are noted not only in quitters, but also in
reducers [43, 44]. This suggests that the harmful effects of
cigarette smoke on the vascular system can potentially be
reversed. By substantially reducing exposure to conven-
tional cigarettes’ hazardous toxicants and achieving clini-
cally relevant BP reductions, EC use may not only improve
the cardiovascular risk profile but also confer an overall
health advantage in smokers unable or unwilling to quit
who are also at risk of developing arterial hypertension
compared to continuing smoking. The use of low risk
nicotine-containing products (including ECs) should be
investigated as a safer alternative approach to harm
reversal (i.e., specific reversal of BP elevation), and, in
general, to harm reduction (i.e., overall reduction of car-
diovascular risk associated with tobacco smoking) [45].
Our RCT has the advantage of an interventional
prospective trial approach, which minimises the possibility
of reverse causality of case–control and cross-sectional
studies. Smoking abstinence was biochemically verified at
each study visit and BP and HR monitoring was assessed
making sure that participants were not smoking/vaping for
at least 30 min prior to each measurements. The effects of
specific continuous smoking phenotypes were investigated
on BP and HR values in the same smokers over several
time points for up to 1 year.
There are, however, some limitations. Firstly, partici-
pants in this study may represent a self-selected sample
(e.g., smokers not intending to quit switching to ECs),
which is not representative of all smokers quitting or
reducing tobacco smoking. However, it still represents a
good cohort of participants to ascertain the effects on BP
and HR. Secondly, approximately 40 % of the participants
failed to attend their final follow-up visit. Although high
attrition rates
in
smoking cessation
studies
are not
uncommon, this, together with the use of a continuous
smoking phenotype classification, and the absence of
financial incentive to study participants, might have further
contributed to small sample size in some smoking pheno-
type subgroup cohorts. Thus, results should be interpreted
with caution.
Additionally, confounding factors (e.g., salt intake, diet,
recreational exercise, alcohol intake) which may have an
influence on BP measures were not taken into account. Last
but not least, findings from the early first generation e-ci-
garette (‘‘cigalikes’’) under investigation may not be
extended to newer-generation devices. It is anticipated that
more advanced devices, by allowing a more fulfilling
vaping experience compared to ‘‘cigalikes’’, can be more
efficient at reducing or quitting smoking. Whether or not
this would indeed have an impact on BP is a separate
research question, which requires future testing.
Conclusions
Smokers who reduce or quit smoking by using ECs may
lower their systolic BP in the long term, and this reduction
is particularly apparent in smokers with an elevated BP. By
showing BP reductions when reducing or stopping smoking
for a sufficient period of time, this study adds to the current
evidence that EC use appears to be a less harmful alter-
native to tobacco smoking [46].
In view of the limitation of the previous research applied
to this area of clinical science, this paper is likely to set
improved methodological approach for future studies
addressing the role of smoking cessation and reduction on
BP and HR as well as other relevant cardiovascular out-
comes. Clinicians are asking for reliable and accurate
health information in regular EC users. The evidence-based
notion that substitution of conventional cigarettes with ECs
is unlikely to raise significant health concerns can improve
counselling between physicians and their cardiovascular
patients using or intending to use ECs.
