Abstract
 Objective—This study tested the hypothesis that poverty experienced in early childhood, as 
measured by income-to-needs ratio, impacts functional brain connectivity at school age, which in 
turn mediates influences on child negative mood/depression.
 Method—Participants were from a prospective longitudinal study of emotion development. 
Preschoolers 3–5 years of age were originally ascertained from primary care and day care sites in 
the St. Louis area and then were annually assessed behaviorally for up to 12 years. Healthy 
preschoolers and those with a history of depression symptoms participated in neuroimaging at 
school age. Using fMRI, we examined whole brain resting state functional connectivity with 
bilateral hippocampus and amygdala.
 Results—Lower income-to-needs in preschool was associated with reduced connectivity 
between hippocampus and amygdala and a number of regions at school-age, including superior 
frontal cortex, lingual gyrus, posterior cingulate and putamen. Lower income-to-needs predicted 
greater negative mood/depression severity at school age, as did connectivity between left 
hippocampus and right superior frontal cortex and between right amygdala and right lingual gyrus. 
Connectivity mediated the relationship between income-to-needs and negative mood/depression at 
the time of scan.
 Conclusions—The finding that lower income-to-needs in early childhood related to 
connectivity of the hippocampus and the amygdala, which in turn predicted negative mood/
depression at school age, further highlights a critical role for poverty in shaping brain development 
and elucidates a relationship to negative child outcomes.

 INTRODUCTION
Poverty is one of the most powerful risk factors for poor developmental outcomes (1–7). 
Children who grow up in poverty have poorer cognitive and educational outcomes and are at 
a higher risk for a range of mental illness, including depression and antisocial behaviors (8). 
The mechanisms by which poverty contributes to these negative developmental outcomes in 
children are multifaceted and include factors such as limitations on educational 
opportunities, family stress, and adverse environmental exposures, such as lead, cigarette 
smoke, poor nutrition and air pollution (3, 6, 9).
The clear evidence for the negative outcomes associated with poverty has led to a growing 
number of studies examining how the early experience of poverty influences brain 
development as a potential mediating pathway. This literature has recently been summarized 
by Brito and Noble (10), who identified evidence for a range of structural brain differences 
associated with various indicators of poverty (i.e., income-to-needs, parent education), 
including reductions in whole brain gray and white matter volumes, as well as reduced 
thickness in some brain areas. One of the most consistent findings has been an association 
between poverty indicators and reductions in hippocampal and amygdala volumes (11–19), 
with every study that examined hippocampal or amygdala gray matter volumes reporting 
significant effects. Importantly, there is evidence that these alterations in hippocampal and 
amygdala volumes partially mediate the influence of poverty on later behavioral problems in 
children (12).
These findings in humans are consistent with the animal literature showing effects of stress 
and environmental enrichment on hippocampal cell proliferation, and dendritic length and 
branching (20–23). The human versus animal findings in regards to the amygdala are more 
complicated. As noted above, poverty is consistently associated with reduced amygdala 
volume. However, animal studies show increased amygdala dendritic arborizatoin following 
stress (23, 24), and human studies of institutional rearing have also shown increased 
amygdala volume (25). The differences in amygdala findings in the results of poverty versus 
institutional rearing studies may reflect the fact that children living in poverty can have 
intact attachment relationships, and thus the mechanisms may differ. Nonetheless, it is 
possible that the hippocampus and amygdala volume reductions associated with poverty 
might also influence connectivity of these regions. Both the hippocampus and amygdala 
show positive resting state functional connectivity (i.e., correlated spontaneous fluctuations 
in blood oxygen dependent fMRI measurements) with each other and other regions in the 
medial and anterior temporal lobes, as well with as the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (at 
age 10+ for this region) (26–28). In addition, both the hippocampus and amygdala show 
negative functional connectivity with bilateral dorsal prefrontal and parietal regions (28). 
These regions showing negative correlations with the hippocampus and amygdala are the 
same regions that are activated in studies of emotion regulation (29, 30), and these “anti-

 correlations” are thought to indicate top-down regulation of emotion and stress responsivity 
supported by hippocampus and amygdala regions, suggesting a critical role for the integrity 
of these connections in mood and affective function.
Importantly, several studies have shown that early life stress and/or maternal deprivation are 
associated with altered connectivity between amygdala and ventral medial prefrontal cortex 
and pregenual anterior cingulate (31–33), as well as other regions (34), connections that are 
thought to be critical for effective emotion regulation. Further, patterns of altered amygdala 
and/or hippocampal connectivity with ventral medial and/or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
have also been seen in individuals with depressive psychopathology (28, 35–37). Given the 
large literature linking early stress to later depression (38, 39) [though not selectively to 
depression], and given previous results of connectivity alterations associated with 
depression, in aggregate these findings taken together could suggest that disruptions in 
amygdala or hippocampal connectivity might be one pathway by which early adversity 
contributes to risk for negative emotionality and depression. Few studies have investigated 
the effects of poverty on functional connectivity, with one showing that poverty predicted 
altered connectivity of amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex while processing emotional 
faces (40). However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined whether early poverty 
influences resting state functional connectivity of either the amygdala or the hippocampus, 
which could reflect alterations in the integrity of intrinsic brain networks important for 
emotion responsivity and regulation.
The goal of the current study was to investigate the effects of poverty on childhood 
hippocampal and amygdala resting state connectivity, as a means to understanding whether 
alterations in these neural circuits might be one pathway contributing to the negative impact 
of poverty on child emotional outcomes and mental health. We also investigated whether 
poverty-related differences in amygdala or hippocampal connectivity predicted subsequent 
negative mood and depression severity and if so, whether these differences in functional 
brain connectivity mediated the influence of poverty on subsequent negative mood.
 METHODS
 Participants
Participants were N=105 children (54 females) from a larger sample enrolled in the 12-year 
longitudinal Preschool Depression Study (N=305 at baseline, between ages 3 and 6). 
Children were invited to participate in the scanning portion of the study if they were 
psychiatrically healthy or if they had experienced a history of clinical depression or anxiety 
(see Supplemental Materials for additional detail). All study procedures were reviewed and 
approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. 
Children were included in the current report if they had usable functional connectivity data 
at the first imaging session (between the ages of 7 and 12), as described below, and had 
parent report data on income-to-needs from the baseline PDS assessment. There were no 
significant differences in demographic variables (age, gender, income-to-needs) between the 
imaging sub-sample and the original sample. There were no significant differences in sex 
(X2=0.50, p=.29), baseline income to needs (t(181)=1.47, p=.144) or negative mood/
depression scores (t(181)=0.96, p=0.34) at the time of scan between the children with and

 without usable functional connectivity data. However, the children with usable data were 
slightly but significantly older (t(181)=2.12, p=0.035; mean 9.93 years for children with 
usable data versus mean 9.53 years for children without usable data). Table 1 shows the 
characteristics of the current study sample.
 Measures
 Income to Needs—Income-to-needs ratio was operationalized as the total family 
income divided by the federal poverty level based on family size (41). The value was 
calculated based on baseline PDS data of caregiver reported total family income and total 
number of people living in the household.
 Psychiatric Diagnosis and Symptom Severity—Participants were assessed 
annually using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA; parent interview, age 3–7) 
and Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment (CAPA; parent interview, age ≥ 8, child 
interview, age ≥ 9)(42) (for further details see (43). A negative mood/depression severity 
score at the time of study entry (preschool, when income-to-needs was measured) was 
calculated using the sum number of core major depressive disorder symptoms (i.e., 
depressed mood, anhedonia, weight change, insomnia/hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation/
retardation, fatigue, worthlessness/guilt, difficulty concentrating, suicidal ideation). A 
similar measure was created for school aged negative mood/depression severity, using items 
endorsed at the assessment wave closest to the scan. An anxiety severity score at the time of 
scan was calculated using the core items from generalized anxiety disorder, separation 
anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. An externalizing psychopathology score at the 
time of scan was calculated using the core items from attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder.
 MRI Scanning
Participants completed a neuroimaging battery including high-resolution structural, diffusion 
imaging, functional task, and resting state scans collected using a 3.0 Tesla TIM TRIO 
Siemens scanner at Washington University. The resting state data from the first imaging 
session were the focus of the current analysis. T1-weighted structural images were acquired 
in the sagittal plane using an MPRAGE 3D sequence (TR=2400ms, TE=3.16ms, flip 
angle=8°, 176 slices, Field of View=256 mm, voxel size=1×1×1 mm). T2-weighted images 
were collected for registration purposes using a 3D SPACE acquisition (TR=3200ms, 
TE=497ms, 160 slices, Field of View=256, voxel size=1×1×1mm). Two resting state fMRI 
scan runs were acquired in the vast majority of children (N=102 in the current sample, the 
other children ran out of time or were unable to stay still during the second run), each 
including 164 frames (each ~6.8 minutes). Participants were instructed to rest with their eyes 
closed and to remain awake. Data were acquired using a spin-echo, echo-planar sequence 
sensitive to blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) contrast (T2*) (TR=2500ms, 
TE=27ms, Field of View=256mm, flip=90°, voxel size=4×4×4mm, slices=36).
 fMRI Pre-processing
Imaging data were preprocessed using the following steps: (1) correction for slice-dependent 
time shifts; (2) removal of first 4 images of each run to allow BOLD signal to reach steady

 state; (3) elimination of odd/even slice intensity differences due to interpolated acquisition; 
(4) realignment of data acquired from each participant within and across scan runs to 
compensate for rigid body motion (Ojemann et al., 1997); (5) image intensity normalization 
to a whole-brain mode value of 1000; (6) registration of the 3D structural volume (T1) to an 
atlas template (WU “711-2B”) in the Talairach coordinate system (Talairach & Tournoux, 
1988) using a 12-parameter affine transform and re-sampling to 1mm cubic representation 
(44, 45); (7) co-registration of the 3D fMRI volume to the T2, and the T2 to the participant’s 
T1 structural image; and (8) transformation of the fMRI data to 3×3×3mm voxel atlas space 
using a single affine 12-parameter transform. Additional processing of the resting state 
functional connectivity used in-house software and is described in more detail in the 
Supplemental Materials.
 fMRI Analysis
We used FreeSurfer v5.1 (46, 47) to create anatomical region of interest masks. The 
hippocampus and amygdala were segmented bilaterally from each participant’s T1 
anatomical image, down-sampled to match the functional resolution of the atlas space 
(3×3×3mm), and registered to the common atlas space. These images were summed and a 
group-level anatomical mask was created by thresholding the region where at least half of 
participants had overlap in their hippocampal and amygdala segmentations, allowing a more 
anatomically precise region of interest than relying on atlas regions of interest. The time-
series from these four regions of interest were correlated with the time-series at every other 
voxel in the brain to create four whole brain voxel-wise correlation maps for each 
participant. Values in these maps were converted to z-statistics using Fisher’s r-to-z 
transform. These maps were used as the dependent measures described below.
 Statistical Analysis
 Normative Connectivity Patterns—To establish the overall patterns of amygdala 
connectivity in our sample, two whole-brain one-sample t-tests were run using in-house 
software (FIDL analysis package, http://www.nil.wustl.edu/labs/fidl/index.html; (48)) to 
characterize significant voxel-wise resting state functional connectivity (r-to-z transformed) 
with the left or right hippocampus and amygdala (note – patterns for amygdala have been 
shown in (49)). Whole-brain t-test results were thresholded based on Monte Carlo 
simulations (3dClustSim, afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dClustSim.html) at 
z≥3 and ≥ 17 contiguous voxels to achieve a whole brain false positive rate of p<.05.
To test our main hypotheses, we examined whole-brain regression analyses predicting voxel-
wise functional connectivity with the left or right hippocampus and the left or right 
amygdala. After screening for outliers (there were none that were above three standard 
deviations in univariate analysis, or which had Mahalanobis distance metrics greater than 
p<.001 in multivariate analyses), baseline income-to-needs was the predictor of interest, 
controlling for ethnicity (African American versus white and other versus white), sex 
(females vs. males), and age at the time of scan, with both income-to-needs and age mean 
centered. Whole-brain z-maps for the effects of income-to-needs were thresholded as above 
based on Monte Carlo simulations at z≥3 and ≥ 17 contiguous voxels to control for multiple 
comparisons (whole brain p<.05). Average connectivity values within each significant

 cluster were extracted for each participant to examine the relationship of these connectivity 
measures to potential mediators and outcomes.
To examine whether the regions showing relationships between income-to-needs and 
amygdala/hippocampal connectivity related to negative mood/depression, we computed 
linear regressions using connectivity measures extracted from the identified regions of 
interest to predict negative mood/depression scores at the time of scanning, controlling for 
age and sex. To control false positives, we corrected for the number of regions identified 
within the amygdala connectivity analyses (p=.05/7, = .007) and within the hippocampal 
connectivity analyses (p=.05/4 = .0125). When significant, we then tested whether either 
income-to-needs or connectivity related to depression severity at the time of scan even when 
accounting for depression severity upon entry to the study (when income-to-needs was 
measured). Significant effects in such analyses indicated a relationship to change in negative 
mood/depression severity over time. We then asked whether the connectivity measures 
mediated the relationship between income-to-needs and negative mood/depression at the 
time of scan, using the PROCESS procedure in SPSS (50, 51), with age at scan, sex and 
ethnicity as covariates.
 RESULTS
 Characterizing Normative Hippocampal and Amygdala Connectivity Patterns
Figure 1 presents the results of whole-brain one-sample t-tests of left and right hippocampal 
and amygdala functional connectivity in this sample, with these seeds defined anatomically 
using FreeSurfer 5.1. Consistent with the prior literature, both the left and right 
hippocampus and amygdala show strong positive connectivity with much of the subcortex, 
including contralateral homologous regions, striatum, brain stem, posterior insula, and 
ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Additionally, both the hippocampus and 
amygdala show strong negative connectivity with much of the dorsomedial PFC, lateral 
PFC, anterior insula, cingulate cortex, and parietal lobe. The hippocampus also shows 
positive connectivity with posterior components of the default mode network (e.g., posterior 
cingulate, lateral parietal cortex).
 Does Income-to-Needs Predict Hippocampal and/or Amygdala Connectivity?
Whole-brain z-maps for the effects of income-to-needs, controlling for ethnicity, sex, and 
age at the time of scan, are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1. Income-to-needs negatively 
predicted connectivity between left hippocampus and regions in the right fusiform and the 
right superior frontal gyrus, as well as between right hippocampus and one region in the 
right superior frontal gyrus (higher income-to-needs -> more negative connectivity). In 
addition, income-to-needs positively predicted connectivity between left hippocampus and a 
region in the right posterior cingulate (higher income-to-needs -> more positive 
connectivity). Income-to-needs also negatively predicted connectivity between left amygdala 
and right superior frontal and right precuneus as well as between right amygdala and regions 
in the right lingual gyrus, left superior parietal, and left paracentral gyrus. Income-to-needs 
also positively predicted connectivity between left amygdala and both left putamen and left 
middle temporal gyrus. For the majority of these connectivity patterns related to poverty,

 higher income-to-needs predicted stronger connectivity in the normative direction (e.g., 
more positive for regions that typically show positive connectivity and more negative for 
those regions that typically show negative connectivity). The overlap between regions 
showing overall connectivity with either hippocampus or amygdala and those connections 
showing relationships to income-to-needs are illustrated in green in Figure 1. There were 
some regions showing functional connectivity relations to income-to-needs that did not 
appear in the average functional connectivity maps, including: left hippocampus to right 
fusiform, right hippocampus to medial superior frontal and left amygdala to middle temporal 
regions.
 Does Poverty and/or Brain Connectivity Predict Negative Mood/Depression Severity at 
the Time of Scan?
Income-to-needs from study entry at preschool age significantly negatively predicted 
negative mood/depression severity at the time of scanning at school age (β=−.27, p=.03). In 
addition, connectivity between the right amygdala and the right lingual gyrus (β=.28, p=.
004), and between left hippocampus and right superior frontal cortex (β=.27, p=.005) were 
associated with negative mood/depression, after correcting for multiple comparisons. These 
relationships are illustrated in the scatterplots shown in Figure 2 and indicate that less 
negative connectivity (more positive) was associated with greater depression. Further, both 
income-to-needs and the connectivity measures continued to relate to negative mood/
depression at the time of scan even after accounting for negative mood/depression at 
preschool age (all ps<.05), indicating a relationship between preschool levels of poverty, 
connectivity, and a change (i.e., increase) in negative mood/depression over time.
 Does Amygdala/Hippocampal Connectivity Mediate the Relationship Between Poverty 
and Negative Mood/Depression at the Time of Scan?
We next examined whether connectivity between right amygdala to right lingual gyrus 
and/or left hippocampus to right superior frontal gyrus mediated the relationship between 
poverty and negative mood/depression measured at the same time as the scan, since all three 
were related to depression in the analysis presented above. As shown in Figure 3, 
hippocampal and amygdala connectivity significantly mediated the relationship between 
income-to-needs and negative mood/depression at the time of scan.
All of the relationships reported above hold if we control for whether or not the child’s 
mother had depression. In addition, as noted, numerous studies have found that poverty 
predicts hippocampal and amygdala volume, including our own prior work on the 
hippocampus. While poverty is related to reduced hippocampal and amygdala volume in the 
current sample (see Supplemental Materials), these volumetric changes do not account for 
the relationship between income-to-needs and connectivity (see Supplemental Materials). 
Further, these relationships are not present for measures of anxious mood or externalizing 
psychopathology (see Supplemental Materials).

  DISCUSSION
The goal of the current study was to investigate whether poverty was associated with 
alterations in the functional connectivity of either the amygdala or the hippocampus, and if 
so, whether these alterations in connectivity were associated with negative mood/depression 
severity. We found that income-to-needs significantly predicted connectivity of both bilateral 
amygdala and bilateral hippocampus, a novel finding that has not previously been shown. 
For the majority of regions, lower income-to-needs was associated with a reduction in the 
normative pattern of connectivity for these regions, such as reduced negative connectivity 
between left hippocampus and amygdala and right superior frontal cortex, functional 
connections thought to play a key role in emotion regulation. Further, both income-to-needs 
and amygdala/hippocampus connectivity were associated with the severity of negative 
mood/depression at the time of scanning, even after controlling for negative mood/
depression at preschool age. These findings indicate that both poverty and connectivity were 
associated with an increase in negative mood/depression over time, as well as overall 
severity levels at the time of scanning. Importantly, connectivity between the left 
hippocampus and right superior frontal gyrus and between the right amygdala and right 
lingual gyrus mediated the relationship between income-to-needs and negative mood/
depression at the time of scanning. As noted in the introduction, numerous studies have 
shown volumetric differences associated with poverty, including consistent reductions in 
amygdala and hippocampal volumes, as well as a recent large scale study showing 
reductions in surface area associated with poverty (52), which mediated links between 
poverty and cognitive function. Importantly, these alterations in connectivity associated with 
income-to-needs found in the current study were not secondary to an influence of poverty on 
amygdala/hippocampus volume, and point to the importance of functional as well as 
structure in the pathways by which poverty shapes child brain function and subsequent 
negative cognitive, emotional and mental health outcomes.
Our results are consistent with a growing body of literature documenting that the early 
experience of poverty has a host of negative influences on child development and that at 
least some of these negative outcomes are mediated by the relationship of poverty to brain 
structure and function. The current findings identify a relationship between functional 
connectivity among regions known to be critical for effective emotion regulation as a 
mediator of the detrimental effects of poverty on negative emotional outcomes. In particular, 
one of our key findings was a relationship between lower income-to-needs and reduced 
negative connectivity between the left hippocampus and amygdala and the right superior 
frontal gyrus. Patterns of “anti” correlations between frontal regions and amygdala/
hippocampal regions are thought to reflect top-down regulation of emotion and stress 
reactivity by cognitive control systems that can help implement effective emotion regulation 
(29, 30). Of note, we do not mean to imply that these alterations in hippocampal to 
prefrontal connectivity associated with poverty reflect changes in structural connectivity, as 
regions can show functional connectivity even in the absence of direct structural 
connections. Further, we do not suggest a unique relationship to either left hippocampus or 
to superior prefrontal cortex, as examining images with a less conservative statistical 
threshold indicates that this area of connectivity extends down into dorsolateral prefrontal

 cortex and is present for the right as well as left hippocampal seeds, albeit at a less 
significant level. Nonetheless, the fact that the reduction in left hippocampus to right 
superior frontal connectivity was associated with negative mood/depression both the time of 
scan is consistent with a hypothesized role for such connectivity patterns in emotion 
regulation and is consistent with other work showing a relationship between altered 
hippocampal to prefrontal connectivity and depression (28). Further, these findings are 
generally consistent with other results published in this sample, including reduced 
hippocampal and amygdala volumes associated with poverty (11), reduced amygdala to 
cognitive control network connectivity among children with a history of depression or who 
are at risk for depression (35) and an interaction between genetic variation associated with 
increased stress reactivity and life events in predicting reduced hippocampal and amygdala 
volume (53).
The finding that connectivity between right amygdala and right lingual gyrus also mediated 
the relationship of income-to-needs to negative mood/depression at the time of scan was 
somewhat more surprising. Our whole-brain analysis of the normative patterns of 
connectivity with the amygdala did not reveal significant amygdala to lingual gyrus 
connectivity, though average connectivity was significant, albeit modest, when examined as 
a region of interest (see Table 2). As such, it is not clear whether this relationship indicates 
the presence of anomalous positive connectivity only present in those with low income/high 
depression, or the presence of negative connectivity only among those with high income/low 
depression. However, prior work on amygdala connectivity has demonstrated negative 
correlations between both lateral basal and superficial amygdala regions and lingual gyrus, 
though in a somewhat more superior region than we saw (26). Lingual gyrus has been 
related to visual form and word processing, but not typically with emotion processing. 
However, a growing number of studies have reported altered activity of the lingual gyrus in 
relationship to negative emotion processing in individuals with mood and psychotic 
disorders (54–57), particularly in relationship to the modulation of negative emotions. 
Combined with our current results, this prior work suggests the need for more focused 
research on the role of the lingual gyrus, and its connectivity with the amygdala, in emotion 
processing and emotion regulation.
A potential limitation of these data is that the original study sample was oversampled for 
preschoolers with symptoms of depression, which might limit generalizability. Specifically, 
we found that income-to-needs was associated with higher negative mood/depression. Some 
prior literature focusing on categorical diagnoses has suggested that change in poverty had 
stronger effects on disruptive behavioral problems (e.g., conduct) than emotional (e.g., 
depression/anxiety) problems in children (58, 59). However, work in older individuals 
provides evidence for a causal relationship between poverty and depression (60–63). In 
general, rates of emotional disorders are much lower than rates of disruptive behavioral 
symptoms in children, potentially limiting power to detect effects in childhood. Our sample 
was enriched for depression symptoms, which may have allowed greater power to detect 
such relationships with depression as compared to anxiety or disruptive disorders. Thus, it 
would be important in future work to replicate these results in a more epidemiological 
sample. Further, it is also likely that the relationships between connectivity and depression 
are more complex and bi-directional and the he current study design cannot definitely

 address causality. Further, the current analysis focused on income-to-needs, and work is 
needed to understand the impact of additional factors also frequently associated with 
poverty. We did not find that the current findings were influenced by maternal support or life 
events (see Supplemental Materials), but future work would benefit from including 
assessments of factors such as nutrition, school quality, and other indicators of enriched 
versus impoverished environments known to be associated with low income-to-needs.
In summary, the current findings provide highly novel data indicating that poverty 
influenced functional brain connectivity in regions thought to be critical for emotion 
regulation, and that these changes in connectivity are a mediating factor by which poverty is 
associated with subsequent negative emotional and mental health outcome. These data add 
to the growing awareness of the immense public health crisis represented by the huge 
number of children growing up in poverty and the likely long-lasting impacts these 
experiences have on brain development and on negative mood and depression.

 Figure 3. Illustration of Functional Connectivity Mediation of Relationship Between Income-to-
needs and Depression Severity at the Time of Scan
This dual mediation model includes two “A” paths (income-to-needs to both left 
hippocampus/right superior frontal and right amygdala/right lingual gyrus connectivity) and 
thus also two corresponding “B” paths for the relationship of these functional connections to 
depression. The fact that both A and both B paths are significant indicates that each of these 
functional connections accounts for independent variance. Beta weights are standardized. 
Path C in black is the total effect of income-to-needs on depression severity with functional 
connectivity not in the model. This is significant. Path C’ in red is the direct effect of 
income-to-needs on depression severity with functional connectivity in the model. Path C’ is 
no longer significant with the connectivity measures in the modeling, indicating that the
