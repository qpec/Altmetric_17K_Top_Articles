Background. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are a group of 
multidrug-resistant bacteria that cause ~9,000 infections annually; ~50% of CRE 
bloodstream infections are fatal. The use of contact precautions (CP) for CRE patients 
can prevent transmission. To improve CRE surveillance and interfacility communi-
cation about positive patients, Illinois implemented the extensively drug-resistant 
organism (XDRO) registry in 2013. Healthcare facilities must report a patient’s first 
positive CRE culture per stay ≤7 days from culture confirmation. Facilities can query 
the registry at patient admission to identify CRE status and implement transmission 
precautions. We assessed facility timeliness of reporting and querying frequency and 
registry usefulness in identifying patients who should be on CP.
Methods. We analyzed Chicago XDRO data for November 2013–October 2016. 
Variables were facility type (hospital, long-term acute care hospital [LTACH], and 
skilled nursing facility [SNF]), culture date, and report date. Timeliness was time from 
culture collection to reporting. Nine facilities (2 hospitals, 4 LTACHs and 3 SNFs) 
completed a survey on querying frequency; all but 1 LTACH provided single day cen-
sus and contact precaution lists. We compared these with the XDRO registry to iden-
tify CRE patients for whom querying would have initiated CP use.
Results. Chicago facilities reported 2,469 CRE cases. Median timeliness varied 
by facility type (hospitals: 8 days; SNF: 10 days; and LTACH: 55 days). Of patients on 
CP for CRE but not reported to the registry, 11/12 (92%) were in LTACHs. Reported 
querying frequency was daily for 1 hospital and rarely for other facilities. Overall, 
91 patients at 8 facilities were in the registry; of these, 0/1 (0%) hospital, 3/27 (11%) 
LTACH, and 28/63 (44%) SNF patients were not on CP.
Conclusion. Timeliness of reporting CRE patients to the XDRO registry varied 
by facility type and exceeded the 7-day timeframe. Routine registry querying can 
identify CRE patients who should be on CP. Querying was uncommon in surveyed 
facilities, identifying an opportunity to improve transmission precautions among CRE 
patients, particularly in SNFs. We recommend facilities report cases in a timely man-
ner and query the registry at patient admission.

Background. Antibiotic resistance is considered as one of our greatest emerging 
public health threats. Current understanding of the factors governing spread of antibi-
otic-resistant organisms and mechanisms among populations is limited.
Methods. We explored the roles of local temperature, population density, and 
additional factors on the distribution of antibiotic resistance across the United States, 
using a database of regional antibiotic resistance that incorporates over 1.6 million bac-
terial pathogens from human clinical isolates over the years 2013–2015.
Results. We identified that increasing local temperature as well as population 
density were associated with increasing antibiotic resistance in common pathogens. An 
increase in temperature of 10oC was associated with increases in antibiotic resistance of 
4.2%, 2.2%, and 3.6% for the common pathogens Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumo-
niae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The effect of temperature on antibiotic resistance was 
robust across almost all classes of antibiotics and pathogens and strengthened over time.
Conclusion. These findings suggest that current forecasts of the burden of anti-
biotic resistance could be significant underestimates in the face of a growing popula-
tion and warming planet.

Background. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have emerged as 
an important cause of healthcare-associated infections. We characterized the molec-
ular epidemiology of CRE in isolates collected through the Emerging Infections 
Program (EIP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Methods. From 2011–2015, 8 U.S. EIP sites (CO, GA, MD, MN, NY, NM, TN 
and OR) collected CRE (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae 
complex, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca) isolated from a normally ster-
ile site or urine. Isolates were sent to CDC for reference antimicrobial susceptibility 
testing and real-time PCR detection of carbapenemase genes (blaKPC, blaNDM, blaOXA-48). 
Phenotypically confirmed CRE were analyzed by whole genome sequencing (WGS) 
using an Illumina MiSeq benchtop sequencer.
Results. Among 639 Enterobacteriaceae evaluated, 414 (65%) were phenotyp-
ically confirmed as CRE using CDC’s current surveillance definition (resistant to 
ertapenem, imipenem, doripenem, or meropenem). Among isolates confirmed as 
CRE, 303 (73%) were carbapenemase-producers (CP-CRE). The majority of CP-CRE 
originated from GA (39%), MD (35%) and MN (11%); most non-CP-CREs origi-
nated from MN (27%), CO (25%) and OR (17%). K. pneumoniae was the predom-
inant carbapenemase-producing species (78%) followed by E. cloacae complex spp 
(12%), E. coli (7.9%), E. Aerogenes (0.9%) and K. oxytoca (0.6%). The most com-
mon carbapenemase genes detected were blaKPC-3 (76%) and blaKPC-2 (19%); blaNDM 
and blaOXA-48-like genes were detected in 1.6% and 0.3% of isolates, respectively. For 
carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp, and E. coli, the pre-
dominant sequence types (ST) were ST258 (65%), ST171 (35%) and ST131 (29%), 
respectively.
Conclusion. The distribution of CP and non-CP-CRE varied across the catch-
ment sites. Among CP-CRE, KPC-producing K. pneumoniae predominated; other 
carbapenemases were rarely identified in the locations under surveillance. Strain types 
known to have increased epidemic potential (ST258 and ST131) were common among 
carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates, respectively.
