IMPORTANCE Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration for severe aortic stenosis in patients who cannot undergo surgery
and for patients at high operative risk. Use of TAVR for off-label indications has not been
previously reported.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate patterns and adverse outcomes of off-label use of TAVR in US clinical
practice.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Patients receiving commercially funded TAVR in the
United States are included in the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry. A total of 23 847
patients from 328 sites performing TAVR between November 9, 2011, and September 30,
2014, were assessed for this study. Off-label TAVR was defined as TAVR in patients with
known bicuspid valve, moderate aortic stenosis, severe mitral regurgitation, severe aortic
regurgitation, or subaortic stenosis. Data were linked with the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services for 15 397 patients to evaluate 30-day and 1-year outcomes.
EXPOSURE Off-label use of TAVR.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency of off-label TAVR use and the association with
in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year adverse outcomes.
RESULTS Among the 23 847 patients in the study (11 876 women and 11 971 men; median age,
84 years [interquartile range, 78-88 years]), off-label TAVR was used in 2272 patients (9.5%).
In-hospital mortality was higher among patients receiving off-label TAVR than those receiving
on-label TAVR (6.3% vs 4.7%; P < .001), as was 30-day mortality (8.5% vs 6.1%; P < .001) and
1-year mortality (25.6% vs 22.1%; P = .001). Adjusted 30-day mortality was higher in the
off-label group (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.55; P = .02), while adjusted 1-year mortality
was similar in the 2 groups (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.98-1.25; P = .11). The median rate of
off-label TAVR use per hospital was 6.8% (range, 0%-34.7%; interquartile range, 3.4%-12.1%),
with hospitals in the highest tertile of off-label use associated with increased 30-day adverse
cardiovascular events compared with the lowest tertile. However, this difference was not
observed in adjusted 30-day or 1-year outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Approximately 1 in 10 patients in the United States have
received TAVR for an off-label indication. After adjustment, 1-year mortality was similar in
these patients to that in patients who received TAVR for an on-label indication. These results
reinforce the need for additional research on the efficacy of off-label TAVR use.

(PARTNER) trial for the treatment of severe, sympto-
matic aortic stenosis in patients with inoperable conditions
(cohort B)1 and high-risk patients (cohort A)2 and subse-
quently received initial approval from the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in November 2011. The Medtronic
CoreValve Transcatheter Aortic Valve system was initially ap-
proved in January 2014. Transcatheter aortic valve replace-
ment (TAVR) is not currently recommended owing to limited
proof of efficacy in adults with the following conditions: low
surgical risk for conventional surgical aortic valve replace-
ment (AVR), known bicuspid aortic valve, severe mitral regur-
gitation, moderate aortic stenosis, severe aortic regurgita-
tion, or subaortic stenosis3; therefore, its use in such patients
would be considered off-label. In many of these patients, the
standard of care would currently be surgical AVR. However,
for high-risk surgical patients or those deemed unable to un-
dergo surgery, TAVR may be used off-label as an alternative to
surgery or medical therapy. Understanding patterns of off-
labelTAVRuseintheUnitedStatesanditsassociationwithcar-
diovascular outcomes could help determine the best ways to
explore and perhaps expand the use of this therapy. Accord-
ingly, we examined the frequency, temporal trends, factors,
hospital-level variation, and adverse in-hospital, 30-day, and
1-year outcomes associated with off-label TAVR use in pa-
tients undergoing commercial TAVR in the United States.
Methods
Context
The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the American
College of Cardiology (ACC) Transcatheter Valve Therapy
Registry was launched in November 2011 in response to the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) National
Coverage Determination requirement for national registry
participation of all commercial TAVR centers.4,5 The de-
sign and methods of the registry have been published
previously.6 Data collected included patient demographics,
comorbidities, and functional status; patient-reported qual-
ity of life; hemodynamics; procedural details; and postpro-
cedural, 30-day, and 1-year outcomes. Data quality checks
are implemented at the National Cardiovascular Data Regis-
try (NCDR) data warehouse and the Duke Clinical Research
Institute analysis center, including data-quality feedback
reports and data range and consistency checks. Waiver of
written informed consent and authorization for use of the
Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry were obtained. Both
were granted by Chesapeake Research Review Incorporated,
Columbia, Maryland.6
Design and Study Population
We identified patients undergoing TAVR at 328 hospitals be-
tween November 9, 2011, and September 30, 2014. Patients
were included if the index TAVR procedure was attempted be-
fore September 30, 2014. Patients were excluded if they were
younger than 18 years of age or did not receive the Edward
SAPIEN or CoreValve transcatheter valve. In the case of mul-
tiple procedures, the index procedure was used.
Off-label use of TAVR was defined as follows: use in pa-
tients with known bicuspid valve, moderate aortic stenosis
(mean gradient <40 mm Hg and valve area >1 cm2 when left
ventricular systolic function is >55%), severe mitral or aortic
regurgitation prior to the procedure, or subaortic stenosis. All
remaining patients were determined to have received TAVR for
on-label indications. Because the CMS National Coverage De-
termination requirement for TAVR is that patients be evalu-
ated and deemed to be at high or severe risk for open AVR, we
assumed that all patients fit these risk categories. Although di-
rect transaortic access and implant for failing bioprosthetic
valves were originally not considered to be within labeled use,
labeling criteria were subsequently amended to include them.
Therefore, these patients are included in the on-label group.
Outcomes
We studied the following outcomes: frequency of off-label
TAVRuseintheentireregistryandassociationofoff-labelTAVR
use with in-hospital mortality, and CMS-linked 30-day and
1-year mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Ad-
verse outcomes were defined using standardized Valve Aca-
demic Research Consortium7 and Valve Academic Research
Consortium–28 definitions for in-hospital outcomes, and they
included mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient is-
chemicattack,aorticvalvereintervention,majorbleeding,ma-
jor vascular complication, incident renal failure with a new
post-TAVR requirement for hemodialysis, or increase in se-
rum creatinine level to 3.0 mg/dL or higher (to convert creati-
nine to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4). A successful
implant was defined as the successful vascular access, deliv-
ery, and deployment of a single device in the proper anatomi-
cal location; the appropriate performance of the prosthetic
heart valve (aortic valve area >1.2 cm2 and mean aortic valve
gradient <20 mm Hg or peak velocity <3 m/s, without moder-
ateorsevereprostheticvalveaorticregurgitation);andthesuc-
cessful retrieval of the delivery system. Aborted procedures
were included in the analysis and were defined as those that
were cancelled or terminated after the patient entered the pro-
cedure room. Outcomes were reported in the registry and to
Key Points
Question What are the frequency and outcomes of the off-label
use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the United
States?
Findings In this registry-based study, off-label TAVR was used in
9.5% of patients, with a cumulative survival rate of 74.4% at 1 year.
In-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality were higher among
patients receiving off-label TAVR and was statistically significant;
after adjustment, 1-year mortality was similar to that among
patients receiving TAVR for on-label indications.
Meaning Transcatheter aortic valve replacement may be a
therapeutic option for patients with off-label indications whose
conditions are inoperable or for high-risk operative candidates.

 the CMS by participating sites. Centers for Medicare & Med-
icaid Services–based outcomes were derived from billing
data using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses codes (eTable 1 in
the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
For analyses pertaining to the frequency of off-label TAVR
use in the registry, we divided the number of patients
undergoing TAVR for off-label indications by the total num-
ber of patients receiving TAVR. The quarterly frequency of
off-label TAVR use since November 2011 was also evaluated
based on current labeling, and the Cochrane-Armitage test
was performed to evaluate the statistical significance of the
trend.
We then compared the baseline patient, hospital, and op-
erative characteristics, as well as postprocedural and in-
hospital events, between patients receiving TAVR off-label and
patients receiving TAVR on-label. Categorical variables were
summarized as counts and proportions and were compared
using the Pearson χ2 test or the Fisher exact test. Continuous
variables were summarized as median values with interquar-
tile ranges (IQRs) and were compared using the Wilcoxon rank
sum test. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score was cal-
culated using the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database risk cal-
culator, version 2.81, for AVR.9 This is used to determine the
risk of operative mortality and morbidity after adult cardiac
surgery on the basis of patient demographic and clinical
variables.
To determine patient-level, hospital-level, and procedure-
level factors associated with off-label use, multivariable lo-
gistic regression analyses were performed. Patient-level char-
acteristicsincludedage,sex,race,insurancestatus,andclinical
variables(priormyocardialinfarction,priorpercutaneouscoro-
naryinterventionorcoronaryarterybypassgraftsurgery,other
prior cardiac surgery, stroke, transient ischemic attack, ca-
rotid stenosis with prior endarterectomy or stenting, periph-
eral arterial disease, tobacco use, type 1 or 2 diabetes, hyper-
tension, dialysis, chronic lung disease, heart failure within 2
weeks, New York Heart Association class III or IV status within
2 weeks, cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest within 24 hours,
porcelain aorta, atrial fibrillation or flutter, tricuspid insuffi-
ciency, body mass index, hemoglobin level, platelet count, al-
bumin level, creatinine level, and international normalized
ratio). Hospital-level characteristics included hospital loca-
tion(rural,suburban,orurban),teachinghospital,hospitaltype
(private or community, university, or government), and TAVR
volume. Procedure-level characteristics included elective sta-
tus and sheath access site.
Records of TAVR procedures were linked to CMS claims
using patient identifiers including social security number and
name. The cumulative incidences of 30-day and 1-year ad-
verse cardiovascular outcomes were then assessed among pa-
tients for whom CMS-linked data were available. We com-
paredoutcomesbetweenpatientsreceivingTAVRoff-labeland
patients receiving TAVR on-label using the Gray test.10 Death
was treated as a competing risk when estimating the cumula-
tive incidence of nonfatal events.
To determine the association between off-label TAVR use
and adverse 30-day and 1-year outcomes, Cox proportional
hazards regression models (for mortality) and Fine and Gray
proportional subdistribution hazards models (for nonfatal
events) were used.11 The results are presented as hazard ra-
tios (HRs) with 95% CIs. Clustering of patients within each
hospital was accounted for using a robust variance estima-
tor. Covariates used for adjustment were age; sex; body sur-
face area; left ventricular ejection fraction; hemoglobin
level; platelet count; number of days from November 1, 2011,
until procedure date; race; dialysis; left main coronary artery
stenosis of 50% or more; proximal left anterior descending
coronary artery stenosis of 70% or more; prior myocardial
infarction; endocarditis; prior stroke or transient ischemic
attack; carotid stenosis; peripheral arterial disease; tobacco
abuse; diabetes; New York Heart Association class IV; atrial
fibrillation or flutter; conduction defect; severe chronic lung
disease; home oxygen therapy; hostile chest (conditions that
make reoperation through a sternotomy or right anterior
thoracotomy prohibitively hazardous); porcelain aorta;
access site (femoral vs other); prior percutaneous coronary
intervention; prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery;
prior cardiac operations (≥2 vs 1 vs 0); prior aortic valve
procedure; prior nonaortic valve procedure; aortic stenosis
etiologic factor (degenerative vs other); valve morphologic
characteristics (tricuspid vs other); tricuspid insufficiency
(moderate or severe vs other); and acuity (elective vs urgent
vs shock or inotropes or assist device vs emergency or sal-
vage or cardiac arrest).
To evaluate hospital-level variation and the association
with adverse 30-day and 1-year outcomes, the rates of off-
label TAVR use were calculated for each hospital. The numera-
tor was the number of patients receiving TAVR at the hospital
for off-label indications, and the denominator was the total
number of patients receiving TAVR at that hospital. Hospitals
were stratified into tertiles based on the proportion of pa-
tients receiving off-label TAVR. The unadjusted and adjusted
associations between hospital tertiles of off-label TAVR use
and 30-day and 1-year composite of death, heart failure,
myocardial infarction, and stroke were determined using
the Cox proportional hazards regression models. The lowest
tertile was used as the reference category. Hierarchical mod-
els with a random intercept were used to adjust for cluster-
ing of patients at the hospital level. The adjusted models
included the same covariates as already listed. All analyses
were performed with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
P < .05 was considered significant.
Results
We evaluated 23 847 patients with an index TAVR procedure
between November 9, 2011, and September 30, 2014 (Figure 1).
The overall rate of off-label TAVR was 9.5% (n = 2272). The
quarterly rate of off-label TAVR increased from 2.9% in 2011
(1 of 35) to 7.6% in 2014 (347 of 4570), with a significant de-
crease in overall off-label TAVR use after the first quarter
(P < .001) (eFigure in the Supplement).

 Baseline characteristics of patients with off-label vs on-
label TAVR use are summarized in Table 1. Compared with pa-
tients receiving TAVR for on-label indications, patients receiv-
ing TAVR for off-label indications were more likely to be
younger (median age, 83 years [IQR, 76-88 years] vs 84 years
[IQR, 78-88 years]), were nonwhite (168 of 2272 [7.4%] vs 1278
of 21 575 [5.9%]), have a higher median STS risk score (7.2 vs
6.8), and receive care in urban centers (1764 of 2272 [77.6%]
vs 15 879 of 21 575 [73.6%]), community hospitals (1550 of 2272
[68.2%] vs 13 990 of 21 575 [64.8%]), and hospitals with higher
median TAVR volume (122 vs 107). They were also more likely
to have had a prior aortic valve procedure (452 of 2272 [19.9%]
vs 3412 of 21 575 [15.8%]) and were less likely to receive TAVR
as an elective procedure (1960 of 2272 [86.3%] vs 19 525 of
21 575[90.5%]).Atotalof1719of2272off-labelimplants(75.7%)
were so classified owing to the presence of severe aortic and/or
mitral regurgitation. Valve-in-valve procedures were per-
formed for 303 of all patients receiving TAVR (1.3%). Among
all patients receiving TAVR, 14 306 (60.0%) had an STS risk
score less than 8%.
Factors associated with off-label TAVR use were age 80
years or less (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.16), prior ca-
rotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting (OR, 1.25; 95%
CI, 1.03-1.51), heart failure within 2 weeks (OR, 1.21; 95% CI,
1.02-1.44), and treatment at a teaching hospital (OR, 1.31; 95%
CI, 1.04-1.66) (Table 2). Patients with prior non–coronary ar-
tery bypass graft surgery (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.93), those
withmoderateorseveretricuspidregurgitation(OR,0.88;95%
CI, 0.78-1.00), and those treated at a government hospital vs
a community hospital (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35-0.88) were less
likely to receive TAVR off-label.
An implant was successful in 92.9% of patients (2090 of
2272 [92.0%] in off-label vs 20070 of 21575 [93.0%] in on-
label; P = .02), with a postprocedure median aortic valve area
of 1.7 cm2 (IQR, 1.4-2.1 cm2) and median aortic valve mean gra-
dient of 9 mm Hg (IQR, 7-13 mm Hg) in the overall cohort. The
frequencies of postprocedural adverse cardiovascular out-
comes and the valvular parameters in both groups are shown
ineTable2intheSupplement.In-hospitalmortalitywashigher
in the off-label vs on-label TAVR group (143 of 2272 [6.3%] vs
1011 of 21575 [4.7%]; P < .001). Compared with patients in the
on-label group, patients in the off-label group had higher rates
of cardiac arrest (149 of 2272 [6.6%] vs 1035 of 21575 [4.8%];
P < .001) and transient ischemic attack (12 of 2272 [0.5%] vs
49 of 21575 [0.2%]; P = .007), with no significant difference
in postprocedural myocardial infarction, stroke, Valve Aca-
demic Research Consortium major bleeding, permanent pace-
maker implant, aortic valve reintervention, and incident re-
nal failure. Patients with off-label TAVR were also more likely
to have residual moderate or severe perivalvular leak com-
pared with patients with on-label TAVR (138 of 2272 [12.4%]
vs 799 of 21575 [7.6%]; P < .001).
Baseline characteristics of patients with CMS-linked data
available vs those without CMS-linked data are summarized
in eTable 3 in the Supplement. Cumulative incidence curves
for adverse cardiovascular outcomes are depicted in Figure 2.
At 30 days, patients undergoing off-label TAVR had higher
unadjusted mortality (8.5% vs 6.1%; P < .001) and heart fail-
ure (5.8% vs 4.3%; P = .01) than patients with on-label TAVR
use. Mortality at 1 year was also higher among patients with
off-label vs on-label TAVR (25.6% vs 22.1%; P = .001) (eTable
4 in the Supplement). Following covariate adjustment,
30-day mortality remained higher in the off-label TAVR
group (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.55; P = .02), while 1-year
mortality was similar in the 2 groups (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.98-
1.25; P = .11) (Table 3). In-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mor-
tality was highest among patients with severe mitral regur-
gitation as the only off-label indication (eTable 5 in the
Supplement).
The median rate of off-label TAVR use per hospital was
6.8% (range, 0%-34.7%; interquartile range, 3.4%-12.1%). The
mean duration of participation in the Transcatheter Valve
TherapyRegistrywashigher(23.8months)forsitesinthehigh-
est tertile of off-label TAVR use compared with hospitals in the

composite of adverse cardiovascular events compared with
hospitals with the lowest tertile of off-label TAVR use (HR, 1.16;

 Discussion
Our data provide an overview of off-label TAVR use in a large
national registry of patients undergoing commercial TAVR in
the United States. Based on the current label indications, 9.5%
of implants were for an off-label indication. The quarterly rate
of off-label TAVR use increased in the first quarter of 2012 and
has decreased since then. In-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mor-
tality rates were higher among patients receiving TAVR for an
off-label indication compared with patients receiving TAVR for
an on-label indication; however, after adjustment, 1-year
mortality was similar in the 2 groups. Patients with severe
mitral regurgitation as the only off-label indication had the
highest unadjusted in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality
rates compared with patients receiving TAVR for other off-
label indications.
Off-label use implies that a therapy has not been studied
incertainpopulationsorforcertainindications.Itdoesnotnec-
essarily imply that therapy is inappropriate or ineffective for
these patients. Therapy may be appropriate for an individual
patient owing to comorbidities and limited alternative op-
tions despite the therapy’
s lack of approval in a product label.
TheFDAstatementconcerningoff-labelandinvestigationaluse
of marketed medical devices recommends that “[g]ood medi-
cal practice and the best interests of the patient require that
physiciansuselegallyavailable…devicesaccordingtotheirbest
knowledge and judgement.
”12 Furthermore, as noted in an In-
stituteofMedicinereport,effectivecaredeliverydenotes“pro-
viding services based on scientific knowledge to all who could
benefit and refraining from providing services to those not
likely to benefit.”13(p3)
Cumulative survival in our cohort following TAVR for off-
label indications was 74.4% at 1 year. This rate is comparable
with the rate reported for high-risk patients in Cohort A and
the CoreValve trials.2,14 Although we did not compare the ef-
ficacy or safety of TAVR with that of surgical AVR or medical
therapy for patients with off-label indications, our findings
suggest that TAVR is a therapeutic option with acceptable
results at 1 year and may be beneficial for some of these pa-
tients who have inoperable conditions or are high-risk opera-
tive candidates.
There was wide variation in off-label TAVR use among
hospitals, with a median rate of 6.8% (range, 0%-34.7%). The
mean duration of participation in the Transcatheter Valve
TherapyRegistrywashigher(23.8months)forsitesinthehigh-
est tertile of off-label TAVR use compared with hospitals in the
lowest tertile (17.7 months), suggesting that experienced sites
and operators are expanding their use of TAVR to patients who
would not have been routinely considered candidates at the
beginning stages of site development. This finding is not un-
expected, as similar trends were noted from the NCDR in the
off-label use of drug-eluting stents.15 Membership in the high-
est tertile of off-label TAVR use was associated with an in-
creased unadjusted 30-day composite of adverse cardiovas-
cular events compared with hospitals with the lowest tertile
of off-label TAVR use, but this finding was not observed fol-
lowing adjustment at 30 days or 1 year. This finding may be
due to patients at hospitals in the highest tertile having in-
creased risk for poor outcomes with increased comorbidities.
The definition of off-label use is dynamic. There was a re-
cent expansion of both device labels to include patients who
underwent a valve-in-valve procedure. This expansion
occurred as a result of many factors, including the

 Valve-in-Valve International Data registry,16 which reported an
implant success rate of 93.1%, with 1-year survival of 83.2%.
Although the CoreValve label included alternative access sites,
the Edwards SAPIEN valve label is restricted to transfemoral
useforpatientswithinoperableconditionsandeitherthetrans-
femoral or transapical approaches for high-risk patients. As of
2014, an estimated 1 in 4 patients was ineligible for these ac-
cess sites owing to inadequate vessel size or other consider-
ations. Therefore, the STS/ACC received approval for an inves-
tigational device exemption from the FDA to study alternative
access approaches,17 which may lead to further expansion of
the label.
Most patients receiving off-label TAVR had severe mitral
regurgitation or severe aortic regurgitation. The standard of
carefortheseconditionswouldcurrentlybesurgicalAVR.How-
ever, for high-risk surgical patients or those with inoperable
conditions, off-label TAVR or medical therapy may be consid-
ered reasonable options. In our study, patients with severe mi-
tral regurgitation as the only off-label indication who re-
ceived TAVR had the highest in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year
mortality rates, which may have been owing to secondary mi-
tral regurgitation caused by left ventricular dilatation.
A few reports have evaluated individual off-label indica-
tions. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with
moderate or severe mitral regurgitation was evaluated and
found to be associated with increased 30-day mortality but not
1-year mortality,18 comparable to our results. Patients with se-
vere aortic regurgitation undergoing TAVR have lower proce-
dural success, with residual aortic regurgitation of greater than
grade 2 present in 21% of patients and a 1-year mortality rate
of 21.4%.19 Patients with severe aortic regurgitation ac-
counted for nearly 40% of patients in the off-label TAVR group
in our study and are likely the cause of the higher frequency
of residual severe aortic regurgitation and perivalvular leak in
the off-label group after TAVR.
Current clinical guidelines20 do not recommend AVR for
patientswithmoderateaorticstenosis.Somepatientswithlow-
flow, low-gradient severe aortic stenosis may be misdiag-
nosed as having moderate aortic stenosis based on transval-
vulargradientsalone.Ourdefinitionofmoderateaorticstenosis
with a calculated aortic valve area greater than 1 cm2 would
haveexcludedpatientswithlow-flow,low-gradientsevereaor-
tic stenosis. Detailed data concerning stroke volume were not
routinely collected in the registry; consequently, we were un-
able to assess for low flow. In addition, a report of TAVR in bi-
cuspid aortic valves showed a device success rate of 89.9% and
a 1-year mortality rate of 17.5%,21 similar to our results.
Our study indicates a need for further evaluation of TAVR
in off-label indications to inform decisions for patients who
were excluded from the initial trials. Certain off-label indica-
tions may have better outcomes than others, and further stud-
iesmayleadtoexpansionoftheapprovedindicationsforTAVR.
However, it is important to recognize that a TAVR is an inva-
sive procedure associated with important rates of short- and
long-term complications. Until the safety, efficacy, and cost-
effectiveness of off-label TAVR is demonstrated in larger popu-
lations, the use of TAVR in untested populations should be ap-
proached cautiously.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, most patients who
underwent an off-label TAVR had severe mitral regurgita-
tion or aortic regurgitation. These conditions are often load
dependent and, thus, may not be constant from one deter-
mination to another. Second, the interpretation of severity
of regurgitation may vary between echocardiographers, and
no core laboratory assessment of echocardiography was
performed. Third, our study was based on labeling of the
Edwards SAPIEN and CoreValve systems in the United
States, which may be different from labeling found in other
countries, where outcomes of off-label TAVR use may be
different. Fourth, analysis based on valve type and associa-
tion with outcomes was not conducted. Fifth, comparison
between TAVR and alternative therapies including surgical
AVR or medical therapy without AVR in patients with off-
label indications could not be performed. Sixth, we were
unable to evaluate factors that are not captured in the
Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry or the STS risk score
that may be associated with off-label TAVR use as well as
cardiovascular outcomes. Finally, we evaluated 30-day and
1-year outcomes of patients undergoing TAVR with CMS-
linked data available. The outcomes of patients without
available CMS-linked data may have been different.
Conclusions
Approximately 1 in 10 patients in this national registry re-
ceived TAVR for an off-label indication. There was wide varia-
tion in off-label TAVR use among hospitals, with a median rate
of 6.8% (range, 0%-34.7%). Off-label TAVR use was associ-
ated with higher in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality rates
compared with on-label TAVR use. After adjustment, 1-year
mortality was similar in the 2 groups. These results reinforce
the continued need for additional research on the safety and
efficacy of TAVR in specific patient cohorts with off-label in-
dicationsforwhomsurgicalAVRwouldbeconsideredhighrisk
or a prohibitive risk.
