Context: Small studies suggest exogenous estrogen may improve vitamin D status, but the etiology
is unclear because women who use hormones may make lifestyle choices that differentially affect
vitamin D status.
Objective: Our objective was to investigate the association between use of hormonal contracep-
tion and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D).
Design: We used linear regression modeling of cross-sectional data to estimate percent change in
season-adjusted serum 25(OH)D with estrogen use after adjustment for other factors.
Setting: At the enrollment clinic visit (2010–2012) into a cohort study of uterine fibroids, each
subject provided a blood sample, had anthropomorphic variables and skin reflectance measured,
and answered questionnaires on demographics, dietary and supplement intake, contraceptive use,
reproductive and medical history, and behaviors.
Participants: A total of 1662 African American women, community volunteers, 23–34 years old,
living in the Detroit, Michigan, area were included.
Interventions: None.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Serum 25(OH)D was measured.
Results: Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were low (70% �20 ng/ml). Current use of an estrogen-
containing contraceptive was associated with a 20% (95% confidence interval: 14–27) increase in
25(OH)D after adjustment. There was no increase in 25(OH)D among participants who had used
estrogen in the past, but were not current users, indicating that results were unlikely to be due to
unmeasured confounding by factors related to contraceptive choice.
Conclusions: The increase in 25(OH)D with use of estrogen-containing contraceptives raise mech-
anistic questions regarding the biological pathways involved, and highlights the need for studies
that examine possible endogenous estrogen effects on vitamin D. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101:
3370–3377, 2016)

 the form of hormone replacement therapy (3, 4), oral con-
traception (5–12), or exogenous estrogen broadly (hormone
replacement therapy or oral contraception) (13, 14) may be
associated with increases in measured 25(OH)D. The exist-
ing studies in reproductive-aged women are generally small
and vary widely in control of confounders. Importantly, the
choice of a specific type of contraceptive may be associated
with factors (eg, weight, smoking, use of nutritional supple-
ments, level of exercise) that may also impact concentrations
of25(OH)D.Thereforeitremainspossiblethattheobserved
associations between exogenous estrogen and 25(OH)D are
due to factors other than the hormonal exposure itself.
Examining the relationship between exogenous ho-
rmones and vitamin D levels is important for understanding
normal metabolic pathways, making clinical decisions, and
interpreting epidemiologic research on many outcomes as-
sociated with vitamin D. Changes in vitamin D resulting
from either endogenous or exogenous hormones may have
implications for timing of clinical tests for vitamin D defi-
ciency, identification of vulnerable populations, and discov-
ery of possible biologic pathways by which vitamin D might
influence health outcomes.
We investigated the relationship between the use of ex-
ogenous hormones and measured vitamin D status in a
cohort of young African American women from a single
area in the Northern United States. Careful attention to
modeling of season and a rich set of covariates allowed us
tocharacterizethedegreetowhichcurrentuseofestrogen-
containing contraception influences measured concentra-
tions of 25(OH)D.
Materials and Methods
The Study of Environment, Lifestyle & Fibroids recruited 1696
black women aged 23–34 from the Detroit, Michigan, area to
participate in a prospective study of the risk factors for fibroid
incidence and growth. Details of the study have been published
previously (15). Recruitment used both targeted media cam-
paigns designed to saturate the community with information
about the study and direct mailings of study brochures to age-
eligible women who had been patients at Henry Ford Health
System, a collaborating institution. Main inclusion criteria in-
cluded age 23—34 years; self-identification as black, African
American, or partly African American; intact uterus; and no
prior clinical diagnosis of fibroids. All women provided in-
formedconsent.ThestudywasapprovedbyInstitutionalReview
Boards at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sci-
ences and the Henry Ford Health System.
Measurement of 25(OH)D
At enrollment, women attended a clinical visit for an ultra-
sound examination to screen for fibroids, biological sample col-
lection (including a nonfasting blood sample), and anthropo-
metricmeasurements.Bloodforanalysisof25(OH)Dwasdrawn
using a red top vacutainer without additive or preservative and
processed. The serum was aliquoted and stored at �80 C within
24 hours (90% within 5 hours of blood draw). Analysis of
25(OH)D was conducted at Heartland Laboratories using the
LIAISON 25 OH Vitamin D Total assay, a competitive chemi-
luminescence immunoassay (16, 17). Samples were analyzed in
41 batches. Each batch contained 46 participant samples, two
duplicate blind quality control samples created from pooled se-
rum and one National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) level 1 calibration standard (SRM 972). Seven batches
also contained the NIST level 1 standard diluted 2- and 3-fold.
Based on blinded controls, the intra- and interassay coefficients
of variation were 2.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Thirty-two
women had a failed blood draw and two women refused the
blood draw, leaving 1662 women for analysis.
Measurement of supplement and contraceptive
use
Women brought all prescription and over-the-counter medica-
tionaswellasanyvitamin,mineral,orherbalsupplementstheyhad
used in the past 24 hours to the clinic visit where the information
was recorded (24-hour questionnaire). These products were coded
using the Slone Drug Dictionary (Boston University) to determine
constituentswherepossible.Womenwerealsoaskeddirectlyabout
use in the 4 weeks before the clinical visit of: contraception (pills,
patches,implants,injections,vaginalring,orhormonalintrauterine
device [IUD]), multivitamin, vitamin D supplement, or cod liver oil
(4-week questionnaire). In addition, women completed a Block
2005FoodFrequencyQuestionnaire(FFQ)(18),whichwasusedto
calculate both supplement and dietary intake of vitamin D (IU/d)
based on the US Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrient
Database for Dietary Studies.
Based on questionnaire responses, we categorized hormonal
contraceptive use as current use of an estrogen-containing prod-
uct(combinationcontraceptivepill,contraceptivepatchorring),
current use of a progestin-only product (hormonal implant or
IUD, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, progestin-only pill),
or none (including nonhormonal IUDs). We determined that all
women who used estrogen had used preparations with ethinyl
estradiol 10—40 mcg except for one who used a preparation
with estradiol valerate.
We categorized supplement use based on information from
the 24-hour questionnaire, the 4-week questionnaire, and the
FFQ. Participants provided information on use of multivitamins
(assumed to contain vitamin D at lower doses 400–800 IU),
single vitamin D supplements with or without calcium (assumed
to contain vitamin D at higher doses �1000 IU), and cod liver oil
(assumed to contain vitamin D at higher levels [450 IU per tea-
spoon]andgroupedwithsinglevitaminDsupplements).Women
could report more than one supplement type. Nonusers were
those who reported no multivitamin or single vitamin D supple-
ment use on any of the questionnaires. Supplement users were
categorized based on their highest reported intake across ques-
tionnaires. We considered women who reported use of any sup-
plement containing vitamin D on the 24-hour questionnaire as
regular supplement users, and women who only reported use of
any supplement containing vitamin D in the past 4 weeks as
irregular users. We categorized dose of supplement as follows:
low (�200 IU/d of vitamin D supplement on the FFQ or irregular
use of only one supplement type); intermediate (201–600 IU/d
on the FFQ, irregular use of multiple supplement types or regular

 use of a single multivitamin); or high (�600 IU/d on the FFQ,
regular use of multiple supplement types or regular use of a single
vitamin D supplement).
Measurement of additional covariates
Telephone and computer-based questionnaires elicited data
on a wide range of covariates identified based on a review of the
literature. Covariates of interest for vitamin D status included
time spent outdoors and vacation time spent in sunny locations
during the winter. We created a “time outside” variable that
incorporated total hours spent outside between 9 AM and 5 PM
during warm weather (warm enough to go outside without a
jacket or sweater) adjusted (discounted 25–90%) for sun avoid-
ance behaviors and sunscreen use. For data analysis, we trans-
formed time outside to a five-level variable based on quintile cut
points; the within-group median number of total hours spent
outside ranged from 1⁄2 hour/d for the lowest 20% to 4.5 hours/d
for the highest 20%. We categorized vacation time in a warm
sunny place during the preceding winter as none, a week or less,
or more than a week. We used a participant’s self-reported fre-
quency and quantity of alcohol drinking during the past year to
categorize her alcohol use as low (fewer than 10 drinks a year),
moderate (drinking below the threshold (19) for binge or heavy
drinking), and heavy (at least six to eight drinks on days when
drinking occurred, or four or more drinks on a single occasion at
least two to three times per month). We estimated dietary intake
of vitamin D from the FFQ (18) and categorized it using quartile
cut points.
At the clinic visit, height and weight were measured in du-
plicate for each woman and used to calculate body mass index
(BMI): weight (kg)/height2 (m2). Skin reflectance on the upper
inner right arm was measured using a Cortex Technology DSM
II Colormeter. The final melanin index, the average of the trip-
licate measurements, was approximately normally distributed
and ranged from 30 to 106.
Statistical analyses
Primary analysis
Measured 25(OH)D levels had a skewed distribution (Fig-
ure 1). We log2-transformed 25(OH)D values for data anal-
ysis because that transformation normalized the distribution
of residuals better than others.
Serum 25(OH)D levels show marked seasonal variation
that was modeled using a cosinor model (20, 21). The time
variable in these models, denoted d, was a transformation of
the date of blood draw to the number of days from January 1
(ie, January 1–December 31 transformed to day 1 though day
365). Initial linear regression models included sine and cosine
of 2�kd/365.25 for k � 1, 2, 3, 4 (ie, the first through fourth
harmonics). Using likelihood ratio (LR) tests, we concluded
that the first and second harmonics adequately captured the
seasonal variation.
To examine the crude seasonally adjusted association between
use of an estrogen-containing contraceptive and 25(OH)D, we
added a term for current use of an estrogen-containing contracep-
tive to the seasonal model based on the first two harmonics. Next,
we built a full model (described in detail in the following section)
that incorporated estrogen use and all other variables, together
with selected interaction terms that involved sine and cosine of the
first harmonic to allow for possible differences between subgroups
in their seasonal patterns. We used a backwards elimination strat-
egy using LR tests that addressed the interactions in the model to
form a final parsimonious model from the full model without sac-
rificing goodness-of-fit.
The backwards elimination approach removed main effects,
interaction terms alone (both sine and cosine) or main effects and
interactions as a block using a P value threshold of .1. Following
the removal of each block, we refit the model, and evaluated
goodness-of-fit using LR tests, removing additional variables as
needed. Model reduction stopped when goodness-of-fit was no
longer consistent with the full model. We used the resulting final
multivariable model to determine if exogenous estrogen was as-
sociated with serum 25(OH)D after accounting for other impor-
tant available predictors.
In preliminary analyses, women with very low serum con-
centrations of 25(OH)D tended to have high residuals from
model predicted values. Consequently, we included an indicator
for very low vitamin D intake (no supplement use and below the
median [100 IU/d] for dietary vitamin D intake) to allow for a
different seasonal pattern for this subset of women. Preliminary
analyses also indicated that 25(OH)D levels varied little across
categories of BMI, alcohol use, and education except for a shift
in the highest categories. Therefore we dichotomized BMI, al-
cohol use, and education (BMI � 35 vs BMI �35, heavy drinking
vs all others, college education vs all others). All models were
fully nested using N � 1658 women with complete data on all
covariates.
The full model for log2 25(OH)D included sine and cosine
terms for the first and second harmonics as described previously
and hormonal contraceptive use (any estrogen, progesterone
only, none [reference]) plus the following variables: vitamin D-
containing supplement use (low, intermediate, high, none [ref-
erence]), dietary vitamin D intake (lowest quartile [reference]),

quintile [reference]), winter vacation to a sunny location (�7
days, �7 days, none [reference]), age at enrollment (continuous),
college education (yes/no), current smoking (yes/no), parous
(yes/no), heavy alcohol use (yes/no), BMI �35 (yes/no), and mel-
anin (continuous on a 10-point increment scale). In addition, the
full model included interaction terms with the first harmonic sine
and cosine variables to allow for different seasonal patterns
among women within the separate categories of supplement use,
very low vitamin D intake, time spent outside, winter vacation in
a sunny location, heavy alcohol use, current smoking, and BMI
higher than 35. Finally, it also included an interaction between
the first harmonic and the continuous measure of melanin.
We reported model-based estimates and 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs) for the percent difference in serum 25(OH)D asso-
ciated with a 1 unit change in the predictor using the formula
100(2� � 1).
Sensitivity analyses
We conducted five sensitivity analyses.
1.
Given the numerous lifestyle choices that may impact the
choice of contraceptive, unmeasured lifestyle factors may
be acting as confounders of the observed association. To
evaluate this possibility, we examined the association be-
tween past (but not current) use of estrogen-containing
contraceptives and 25(OH)D. This strategy was based on
our observation that intermittent use of hormonal con-
traception was common, which supports the assumption
of this analysis: past and current users of estrogen share
unmeasured lifestyle factors related to contraceptive
choice. For this analysis, we categorized women as cur-
rent users of estrogen, past (but not current) users of es-
trogen, or never users of estrogen. The two indicator vari-
ables for current use of estrogen and past use of estrogen
replaced the single “use of estrogen” variable in the final
model (never users of estrogen became the reference).
2.
The dose of ethinyl estradiol in the current contraception
was available for most women (N � 20 missing). To
explore dose-response, we used a model that included
indicator variables for current ethinyl estradiol dose (0
[reference], 10 or 15 mcg, 20 or 25 mcg, 30 mcg, 35 mcg).
3.
To examine the possibility that the effect of exogenous
estrogen was different for women using supplements that
included vitamin D, we constructed interaction terms be-
tween use of exogenous estrogen and the three levels of
supplement use.
4.
To examine the influence of the source of data for sup-
plement use we reran the final model using supplement
use defined solely by the FFQ or by the 24-hour/4-week
questionnaires.
5.
The samples for 25(OH)D were sent for assay in two
shipments several months apart. To assess whether this
temporal separation in assays influenced results, we reran
the final model excluding samples from the smaller ship-
ment (N � 307).
Results
Serum measurements were available for 1662 participants.
Overall concentrations of 25(OH)D were low (median,
15.7 ng/ml), well below the 20 ng/ml level recommended by
the Institute of Medicine (2). Use of any supplement con-
taining vitamin D was common (40%); however, supple-
ment use varied with factors such as education, smoking,
melanin, and time spent outdoors (Table 1).
Participants using an estrogen-containing contracep-
tive at baseline had an elevated median 25(OH)D (19.4
ng/ml); however, they were also more likely to be using a
supplement (49%). Distribution of 25(OH)D stratified by
both supplement use and estrogen-containing contracep-
tive use (Figure 1) showed an overall increase in 25(OH)D
amongusersofestrogen-containingcontraceptivesamong
both supplement users and nonusers. In a model only ad-
justed for season, use of an estrogen containing contra-
ceptive was associated with a 30% increase (95% CI:
22%, 38%) in 25(OH)D.
The full model included 43 variables (Supplemental
Table 1) with an R2 of 0.37. After model reduction 19
variables remained (Supplemental Table 1). The final
model had an R2 of 0.36. Percent change in serum con-
centrations of 25(OH)D for use of an estrogen contain-
ing contraceptive and use of supplement (to provide
context for the magnitude of increase) are shown in
Table 2. Use of an estrogen containing contraceptive
was associated with a 20% higher 25(OH)D (95% CI,
14–27), which was greater in magnitude than the low-
dose supplement (14% difference; 95% CI, 8–21). Only
the use of a high or intermediate dose of supplement was
associated with larger percent differences, 77% differ-
ence (95% CI, 60–95) and 46% difference (95% CI,
38–54), respectively.
In a sensitivity analysis that classified women as cur-
rent, past, or never users of estrogen-containing contra-
ception, current users (N � 226) showed a percent differ-
ence similar to that from the main analysis (19%
difference; 95% CI, 12–26), whereas past users (N �
1020) had a small negative association (�1% difference,
95% CI: �5 to 3) consistent with the null.
Each dose of ethinyl estradiol (10 or 15 mcg, 20 or 25
mcg, 30 mcg, 35 mcg) had a similar percent difference
(range, 19.9–21.1%) compared to no use of estrogen-con-
taining contraception.
Classification of supplement dose using solely the FFQ
or the 24-hour/4-week questionnaire resulted in estimates
for the estrogen effect that were nearly identical to those
in our primary analysis (data not shown).
The interaction between estrogen and supplement use
was not statistically significant, indicating that the estro-
gen association remained constant across levels of supple-
ment use. Finally, the primary findings were robust when
we excluded observations from the smaller shipment of
25(OH)D samples (results not shown).

 Discussion
Previous studies have suggested an increase in serum
25(OH)D among women using exogenous estrogen
(3–14). Most previous studies of premenopausal women
were small (fewer than 150 women) (5–10) and/or were
unable to account for supplement use behavior that may
vary with contraceptive use—covariation that is evident
in our study. Using detailed information from 1662 young
African American women in the Detroit area, we provide
strong evidence to support the hypothesis that exogenous
estrogen use increases serum 25(OH)D. Other factors in-
cluded in the model showed effects in expected directions
supportingthevalidityofourdata.Forexample,increased
BMI was associated with a decrease in the concentration
of 25(OH)D as reported in other studies (10, 14, 21) (Sup-
plemental Table).
In our model, supplement use was the strongest pre-
dictor of vitamin D levels. Although use of supplements
varied by type of contraceptive, the final adjusted model
identified an independent 20% increase in 25(OH)D
among women using estrogen-containing contraceptives.
The 20% increase we observed is well within the range
(5–40%) reported in prior studies of pre- and postmeno-
pausal women (3–7).
The mechanism for this increase is not well-under-
stood. In addition to elevations in 25(OH)D, exogenous
estrogen has been associated with increases in the vitamin
D binding protein (VDBP) (7, 22–24), the active metab-

 olite 1,25(OH)2 D (7, 22–25), and the metabolically in-
active 24,25(OH) vitamin D (3). VDBP is synthesized in
the liver and may respond in a similar fashion to other
estrogen-sensitive hepatic proteins (thyroid binding glob-
ulin,SHBG,andcorticosteroidbindingglobulin)(26–28).
It has been suggested that increases in VDBP may increase
the half-life of 25(OH)D (29). However, the ratio of cir-
culatingVDBPto25(OH)Disveryhigh(1000:1)(30),and
whether inducing physiologic changes in VDBP can influ-
ence 25(OH)D has not been directly tested.
Our models accounted for only about a third of the
observed variance in serum 25(OH)D concentrations,
similar to previous studies where the primary goal was to
predict serum 25(OH)D based on covariates available in
epidemiologic studies (4, 9, 10, 31). Recognized inaccu-
racies in the calculation of vitamin D from dietary sources
(32, 33) likely diminished the explanatory power of all
thesemodels.Inours,theinabilitytopreciselyquantifythe
dose and consistency of supplement use also contributed.
Genetic variants can influence 25(OH)D (34), but geno-
type data were unavailable in all these studies. It is also
likely that some predictors of vitamin D status remain
unidentified. Importantly, however, even with relatively
high-quality data on many of the known predictors of
vitaminD,predictionsofnewobservations(forinstanceat
a different time point, or for participants with missing
serum measures) based on all such models would be im-
precise. This imprecision has implications for epidemio-
logic studies. Prediction of past, present, or future con-
centrationsof25(OH)Dtoaddressmissingdatawillresult
in substantial error. Measured vitamin D status at each
time point of interest is crucial particularly in young
populations where individuals may frequently change im-
portant behaviors such as supplement use, dietary prefer-
ences, contraceptive use, or leisure time activities.
The assay used to measure 25(OH)D in this study tends
to underestimate 25(OH)D when compared to the gold
standard of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spec-
trometry (35). Our internal quality control results based
on known NIST standards suggest that the LIASION as-
say underestimated 25(OH)D by 2–5 ng/ml across the
range of values measured. The assay orders the individuals
appropriately regarding their 25(OH)D, however, so con-
tinuous values from this assay are useful in epidemiologic
studies.
Despite possible underestimation by our assay, the
women in this study would still be regarded as having low
concentrations of 25(OH)D. This result is not surprising
because vitamin D deficiency is common across the United
States with 42% of all women below the 20 ng/ml thresh-
old, and a higher prevalence of deficiency (80%) among
non-Hispanic black women (36). Low vitamin D levels
have been associated with reproductive outcomes includ-
ing reduced fertility, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes,
and poor fetal growth (reviewed in Luk (1)). In reproduc-
tive age women planning pregnancy, clinical testing of
vitamin D levels should take into account recent contra-
ceptive use. Women who discontinue estrogen-containing
contraception to start a pregnancy attempt may be at risk
of falling 25(OH) D during the important preconception
and early gestation period.
The observed association between estrogen-containing
contraceptive use and 25(OH)D levels could result in con-
founding bias even in vitamin D studies involving nonre-
productive outcomes (reviewed in (37)). For example, a
recent study (38) found that the observed association be-
tween 25(OH)D and C-reactive protein was due solely to
confounding by contraceptive use. Careful documenta-
tion of exogenous hormone use will be important to any
study examining the role of vitamin D and health or dis-
ease in women.
In conclusion, we found that use of an estrogen-con-
taining contraceptive was associated with increased level
of serum 25(OH)D among young African American
women. This finding has clinical implications when coun-

implications for studies of vitamin D and any health out-
come where exogenous estrogen use may be an important
confounder. Further work is needed to elucidate the bio-
logical pathways responsible for the observed association
and to investigate endogenous estrogen effects including
how 25(OH)D levels may vary with life course changes
such as onset of puberty, pregnancy, and menopause.
Finally, we, like others, had limited ability to adequately
explain vitamin D variation based solely on regression
models. To the extent possible, epidemiologic studies
should measure 25(OH)D concentrations at the time
points of interest for the hypothesis being tested.
