Diabetes has become a highly problematic and increasingly prevalent disease world-
wide. It has contributed toward 1.5 million deaths in 2012. Management techniques for
diabetes prevention in high-risk as well as in affected individuals, beside medication,
are mainly through changes in lifestyle and dietary regulation. Particularly, diet can
have a great influence on life quality for those that suffer from, as well as those at
risk of, diabetes. As such, considerations on nutritional aspects are required to be
made to include in dietary intervention. This review aims to give an overview on the
general consensus of current dietary and nutritional recommendation for diabetics.
In light of such recommendation, the use of plant breeding, conventional as well as
more recently developed molecular marker-based breeding and biofortification, are
discussed in designing crops with desired characteristics. While there are various
recommendations available, dietary choices are restricted by availability due to geo-,
political-, or economical- considerations. This particularly holds true for countries such
as India, where 65 million people (up from 50 million in 2010) are currently diabetic and
their numbers are rising at an alarming rate. Millets are one of the most abundant crops
grown in India as well as in Africa, providing a staple food source for many poorest of the
poor communities in these countries. The potentials of millets as a dietary component
to combat the increasing prevalence of global diabetes are highlighted in this review.

TYPE 2 DIABETES OVERVIEW AND ASSOCIATED
COMPLICATIONS
Diabetes is a chronic disease that is characterized by high level of blood glucose also known as
hyperglycaemia. According to WHO 2015 published figure1, 9% of the world population aged 18
and above has contracted diabetes and an estimated 1.5 million deaths per year are attributed to
diabetes directly. It is well known that glucose level of a diabetic patient increases dramatically
beyond the normal range after a meal. It is also true that their blood glucose level would soon drop
as the body failed to store the excess glucose for later use.
Diabetes is classified into Types 1 and 2. Type 1 diabetes is also known as juvenile diabetes
or insulin-dependent diabetes as the patients’
pancreas cannot produce or produces little insulin
and often presents itself from childhood (Diabetes.co.uk, 2016c). Type 2 diabetes (T2D), however,
often first appears in adults when the body becomes resistant to insulin or fails to make sufficient

amounts of insulin (Martin et al., 1992; Weyer et al., 2001).
T2D comprises 90% of people with diabetes around the world
(NHS choice, 2014). This can largely be the result of excess
body weight and physical inactivity. Added complication to T2D
is that it presents less marked symptoms than Type 1 diabetes
and is often diagnosed only when complications have already
arisen.
Major complications caused by hyperglycaemia include
atherosclerosis that hardens and narrows the blood vessels.
Other diabetes-related complications are heart disease, stroke,
retinopathy, and kidney failure (Bitzur et al., 2009; Sone
et al., 2011). Diabetic retinopathy leads to blindness by causing
cumulative damage to the small blood vessels in the retina and
contributes to 1% blindness globally. Similarly, kidney failure
due to prolonged restricted blood flow is a very common
complication. Elevated blood glucose can also cause nerve
damage (Boulton et al., 2005) that may lead to the need of limb
amputation (Brownlee, 2001). Such ailments reduce the patients’
quality of life, and potentially relationship with others around
them.
Other additional complications also include increased bone
fracture risks in both Types 1 and 2 diabetics (Saito et al.,
2006; Vestergaard, 2006; Oei et al., 2015). Interestingly, however,
Types 1 and 2 diabetics have lower and higher bone mineral
density than healthy subjects, respectively, even though both are
at elevated risk of fracturing (Ma et al., 2012; Oei et al., 2013;
Strotmeyer, 2013; NIH Osteoporosis and Related Bone Disease
National Resource Center, 2015). Fracturing risks associated
with different bone mineral densities can be explained by
other diabetes related factors. Firstly, T2D subjects are often
found to have higher body mass index and less physical
exercise making any fall carrying a higher risk of fracture
(Vestergaard, 2006; Ma et al., 2012). Also, other complications
such as retinopathy, as well as often-associated habits such
as higher alcohol consumption interfering with the sense of
balance, making fall more frequent adding to the fracture
risk (Rubin, 2015). Physiologically, the rise of glucose level in
the body interferes with glycation that subsequently reduces
collagen cross-linking and results in more brittle bone despite
the higher bone mineral density (Hein et al., 2006; Saito
et al., 2006; Vestergaard, 2006). In addition, lower bone
turnover rate causes poor fracture healing in diabetic patients,
through interference from alternated glycaemia with a key
bone remodeling regulator, the parathyroid hormone (Rubin,
2015). Therefore, in many converging ways, T2D contributes
toward a higher fracture risk. Subsequently, fractures further
restrict the mobility of patients, worsening the condition of
diabetes.
Another symptom that a T2D patient may have to endure
involves muscle fatigability due to poor glycaemic control
(Halvatsiotis et al., 2002). This in turn causes tiredness and lack
of energy often demotivate patients from engaging in physical
exercises. Also, patients loose muscle mass as the body draws
energy from breaking down muscles. Such abnormal anabolism
of muscle makes muscle mass loss one of the many dangers that a
diabetic patient have to face (Møller and Nair, 2008; Bassil and
Gougeon, 2013). The subsequent loss of motor function adds
further physical as well as psychological complications to the
patients.
WHY DIET IS AN IMPORTANT
INTERVENTION
Diabetic patients experience fluctuation of blood glucose causing
various health complications (Coppell et al., 2010; Jali et al.,
2012). One of the interventions is to control this fluctuation using
dietary regulation with or without exercise and medications.
With the number of people suffering from diabetes on the rise
globally (WHO, 2016), it is imperative to develop preventative
measures involving intervention of diet and lifestyle, which
would greatly reduce the risk of developing diabetes (Diabetes
Prevention Program Research Group, 2002; Lindstrom et al.,
2006). In addition, the risk of subsequent health complication can
be reduced with the right treatment (Gaede et al., 1999). Indeed,
decline of diabetes-related complication such as retinopathy has
been shown to be positively correlated with earlier intervention
(Vallance et al., 2008). This results in the reduction of financial
burden on the health services as well as improving the well-being
for the patients.
A study by the Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group
(2002) concluded that lifestyle intervention resulted in 39%
lower incidence of diabetes than another group using only
metformin, an interventive medication for people who are at risk
of diabetes. The same study found that both lifestyle intervention
and metformin were effective in restoring normal fasting glucose
values. Indeed, lifestyle intervention, including dietary habit
reform, was found to be more effective in restoring normal
glucose values after ingestion. Though this experiment was not
designed to investigate dietary change or increased physical
activities individually, it was undeniable that both contributed
significantly toward lowering the risk of developing diabetes.
It is notable that there are different prescribed diets across
continents and countries (Ajala et al., 2013). Based on extensive
literature search, Ajala et al. (2013) concluded that lower
carbohydrate and Mediterranean diet lowers HbA1c count
(HbA1c is a test of blood glucose level over a period of time). In
some cases, vegetarian (Kahleova et al., 2011) and low-glycemic
index (GI) (Ben-Avraham et al., 2009) diets were recommended
to help reduce the use of diabetic medication.
Interestingly, two studies comparing high-protein diet and
high-carbohydrate diet showed no significant differences in
weight loss between the two diet groups (Brinkworth et al., 2004;
Larsen et al., 2011). In fact Larsen et al. (2011) showed that the
two different diets did not produce any difference in the level
of HbA1c. That may explain as to why there are variations in
accepted dietary recommendations for T2D patients. However,
Brinkworth et al. (2004) did observe better improvement on
blood pressure for those that were on high protein diet and
concluded that it may have a long term favorable effect on
cardiovascular risk profile. Both papers noted that the two
different diets improved the general health for T2D patient.
An interesting conclusion was drawn in a study with more
than 37 000 participants, of which 915 incidences of diabetes

Millets for Type 2 Diabetes
were reported over 10 years (Sluijs et al., 2010). This study has
confirmed that a positive correlation exists between higher GI
food and diabetes and that fiber intake inversely correlated with
diabetes. Interestingly, only starch in the carbohydrate sub-types
was found to be related to diabetes risk. They concluded that
diet constituents play a major part in controlling diabetes. These
are just a few examples of how dietary intervention can improve
diabetic condition.
CURRENT RECOMMENDED DIETS FOR
DIABETICS
Diets play an important role in controlling the on-set of diabetes,
as there is a positive correlation between dietary glycaemic load
and increased diabetic risk (Sluijs, 2011; Greenwood et al., 2013).
Eating the ‘
wrong’thing can accelerate the onset of diabetes.
On the bright side, study has shown that dietitians can select
appropriate intervention diets based on the client’
s lifestyle
(Franz et al., 2010). Such options reduce the requirement to
impact on the patients’
lifestyle, thus increasing the likelihood of
the treatment to be successful.
Problems with dietary intervention, however, also arise from
different standards from different countries. For example, the
United Kingdom has a very different standard than the rest
of Europe (Ben-Avraham et al., 2009; Ajala et al., 2013). Also
the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Canadian
Diabetes Association (CDA) show differences among themselves,
as well as with their European counterpart (Ben-Avraham et al.,
2009). More differences can be observed when Japan, South
Africa, and India are added into the collective. This may mainly
be due to the lifestyle differences between different cultures, but
also to different dietary requirements in their local climate. Also,
there seems to be many variations in terms of the length of studies
on dietary intervention on T2D (Salas-Salvado et al., 2011). These
studies ranged from less than 4 and up to 23 years with variable
dietary comparison as well as sample sizes. Further, some benefits
from life style intervention requires longer observation period
with higher sample size to draw a more accurate conclusion (The
Look Ahead Research Group, 2010).
A quick scan on recent publications of various nutrition
recommendations for diabetics is summarized in Table 1 (Ben-
Avraham et al., 2009; Salas-Salvado et al., 2011; Ajala et al., 2013).
All these recommendations include carbohydrate, fiber, protein
and fat. Most countries would recommend for carbohydrate
intake to range from 40 to 60%, with the exception of India
(>65%). Fat intake varies between different diets while protein
intakes varied between 10 and 35%. Most recommendations
would also include advice for fiber intake except the US. Yet the
defined unit for fiber differed from one another. So there is a lack
of uniform recommendation of diet globally. One, however, may
question the sensibility of having a uniform recommendation as
people from different regions have very different lifestyles as well
as physiologies.
Salas-Salvado et al. (2011) suggested a dietary regime of plant-
based food with a lower intake of meat, sweets, high-fat dairy
and refined grains, which is commonly known as Mediterranean
diet, for lowering the risk of diabetes. This recommendation
has attracted attention (American Diabetes Association, 2016;
Diabetes.co.uk, 2016b) and research (Trichopoulou et al., 1995,
2003). Note that Mediterranean diet has a diversity of definition
depending on geographical location. The Mediterranean diet
here is referring to that of Greece and southern Italy in the early
1960s (Willett et al., 1995). Mediterranean diet is characterized
by a high intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, cereals, and
a high intake of olive oil but a low intake of saturated lipids, a
moderately high intake of fish (depending on the geographical
location), a low-to-moderate intake of dairy products, a low
intake of meat and poultry, and a regular but moderate intake of
wine during meals. Total fat in this diet may be higher (40–
42%,
Table 1) but the mono-unsaturated:saturated fat ratio is above
two. However, Salas-Salvado et al. (2011) admitted that this diet
alone may not suffice in controlling incidence of diabetes.
The limited information in literature on the role of micro-
nutrients seems to indicate that they can have significant
influence on diabetes (O’
Connell, 2001). The latter part of this
review will attempt to investigate the relationship of micro-
nutrients with health benefits against diabetes.
Carbohydrates and Fiber
Starch is a carbohydrate that provides much needed energy for
day-to-day activities. It is essentially composed of linear amylose
involving α-1,4 linked D-glucopyranosyl units and branched
amylopectin which is also interconnected by α-1,6 glycosidic
linkages (Zhang et al., 2006a,b; Lehmann and Robin, 2007). The
chain length and branching pattern, as well as the amylose to
amylopectin ratio, all play a role in digestion efficiency (Zhang
et al., 2006a,b).

Millets for Type 2 Diabetes
Starch is generally divided into three different digestibility
types: rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch
(SDS), and resistant starch (RS) (Englyst et al., 1992). RS
is characterized by the fact that it is unable to be broken
down in the small intestine and is therefore passed onto the
large intestine. RS is further divided into three different types:
physically inaccessible starch (RS1), resistant starch granules
(RS2), and retrograded amylose (RS3) (Sajilata et al., 2006). RDS
is referred to the starch fraction that is transformed into glucose
soon upon ingestion (20 min). RDS is digested and absorbed
in the duodenum and proximal regions of the small intestine
(Englyst et al., 1992). The rapidly digestible nature of the RDS
causes a rapid rise of blood glucose followed by a subsequent
hypoglycaemia. On the other hand, SDS is referred to starch that
breaks down into glucose over a longer duration (20–
120 min;
Lehmann and Robin, 2007; Zhang and Hamaker, 2009). The slow
release of SDS improves overall blood glucose control as well as
providing stable energy to patients with T2D.
While RS is not digested and absorbed by human as energy,
it has a positive role against diabetes. Johnston et al. (2010)
has discovered that consumption of resistant starch improves
insulin sensitivity. It does not affect body weight, fat storage
in muscle, liver or visceral depots significantly. Also, it helps
managing meal-associated hyperglycaemia (Lehmann and Robin,
2007). This is particularly important for people who are at risk of,
or suffering from, T2D.
Slavin
(2005)
defined
dietary
fiber
as
non-digestible
carbohydrates and lignin that are derived from plant. It can
be further classified into soluble and non-soluble fiber (Slavin,
2003). It has already been known for a while that fiber plays a
positive role in glycaemic control (Jenkins et al., 1978; Chandalia
et al., 2000). It is recommended that an increase of dietary fiber,
particularly the soluble type, should be taken by T2D patients
(Wood et al., 1990; Slavin, 2005). It is reasoned that soluble
fiber reduces enzyme access to its substrates through viscosity
effect. Slavin (2005) has concluded that fiber intake and obesity
are inversely correlated, indicating that fiber is an important
instrument in starch and cholesterol control.
Starch granule structure is organized in concentric layers
with amylopectin as branching polymer and amylose as liner
polymer (Gallant et al., 1992; Zhang et al., 2006a). These layers are
organized in crystalline structures that form different patterns,
resulting in variable enzymatic digestion susceptibility. Note
that starch physical structure alone may not necessarily reflect
glucose response in the gastrointestinal tract. For an example,
physical mixture of starch and protein can influence digestion
time (Zhang and Hamaker, 2009). Therefore, partially adding
non-starch filler such as protein or fiber, potentially can produce
a lower glycaemic response. Like many other nutrients, starch can
be modified by other additives (Agama-Acevedo et al., 2012). By
adding unripen banana flour into cookies, Agama-Acevedo et al.
(2012) have reduced RDS and increased SDS contents. Hence,
even if the intrinsic RDS, SDS, and RS ratios of a type of food
may give indication of GI responses, it can be influenced by other
nutrients present in the meal.
Another carbohydrate to consider is sugar intake. It can
often provide rapid energy, in case of emergency of glucose
depletion, for the patient (American Diabetes Association, 2015b;
NHS choice, 2015). On the other hand, most sweet things
(e.g., drinks/cakes/sweets etc.) which people enjoy often contain
too much sugar, thus causing hyperglycaemia (Diabetes.co.uk,
2016a). Sugar-sweetened foods, particularly beverages taken in
large quantity, are generally not recommended for anyone and
particularly those who have or are at risk of diabetes. Although
reducing sugar intake may seem to be a logical step to take
in reducing blood sugar level, eliminating it completely from
diet would be a mistake (American Diabetes Association, 2015a;
Diabetes U. K., 2016). There are, however, alternatives to those
who have a sweet tooth and find sweets irresistible. There
are different sugar substitutes such as sucromalt which shows
delayed glucose and insulin fall (Grysman et al., 2008). Another
sugar substitute that is often used, fructose, has the ability to
blunt glycaemic and insulin responses. The latter may seem to
be advantageous on glycaemic control, but the corresponding
physiological response on human may indicate otherwise (Havel,
2005). Problems arise as fructose is not controlled by the glucose
homeostasis system and high consumption subsequently leads
to dysregulation of energy homeostasis. This may result in
hyperlipidaemia and obesity that further put strain on the person
already suffering from diabetes (Elliott et al., 2002). When it
comes to sugar, perhaps moderation would be the consensus
between many dietary recommendations. A monitored diet
maybe required due to sugar craving caused by previous excess
consumption (Avena et al., 2008).
Protein/amino acid (leucine)
Protein
has
been
repeatedly
identified
as
an
important
component for dietary strategies for diabetics (Ezeogu et al.,
2008; Ben-Avraham et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2010; Ajala et al.,
2013). There are many findings of proteins or specific amino
acids such as leucine that have some positive influence on the
condition of diabetic patients. These include improved glycaemic
control and muscle loss prevention (Manders et al., 2006; Zhang
et al., 2007; Melnik, 2012; Norton et al., 2012).
An advantage of having protein in the food matrix is that it
can influence the rate of starch digestion (Singh et al., 2010).
A study on Sorghum concluded that proteins with disulfide
bonds interfere with starch digestibility (Wong et al., 2009).
Such influence includes delayed starch digestion and control of
postprandial hyperglycaemia. Another study on wheat starch-
protein on glycaemic response and in vitro digestion has
also concluded that the removal of protein such as gluten in
wheat flour causes a rise of postprandial blood-glucose level
(Jenkins et al., 1987). These evidences support the notion that
protein integrated in the food matrix can improve postprandial
glycaemia.
T2D shows a positive correlation with patients’
muscle mass
loss (Bassil and Gougeon, 2013; Leenders et al., 2013). Therefore,
muscle mass maintenance is part of the issue that needs to be
considered. Since muscle is made up of protein, intake of amino
acid is vital. In particular, the amino acid leucine has been known
to induce muscle growth (Dardevet et al., 2000; Crozier et al.,
2005; Katsanos et al., 2006). It has been found to be most effective
through ingestion. In fact, much of the body building products

Millets for Type 2 Diabetes
such as protein shake contains leucine for muscle building as
a significant ingredient (Hennessy, 2013). Protein supplement
such as whey has a substantial level of leucine added to the
product (Jakubowicz and Froy, 2013). It is often mentioned that
consuming protein supplement such as whey has insulinotropic
as well as glucose lowering, effects. This is why leucine is often in
the spotlight of many diabetes research (Melnik, 2012).
The relationship between leucine and glycaemic control is
rather complex. In one way, it appears to help with the condition
by stimulation of insulin production (Zhang et al., 2007).
However, prolonged usage of excess leucine may accelerate the
deterioration of the health condition of the patient (Melnik,
2012). Melnik (2012) surmised that excessive intake of leucine
from meat (often red meat) leads to hyper activation of mTORC1
(mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1), a nutrient-sensitive
kinase. mTORC1 when activated, leads to insulin resistance
in the long term. While in the short term it will increase
insulin production, prolonged supplement of leucine will cause
pancreatic β-cells hyperfunction leading to their early senescence
and apoptosis (Figure 1). The subsequent lack of insulin
production will cause the increase of blood glucose as well as
other side effects. In parallel, the primarily increased insulin
production will also increase insulin resistance, which further
complicates the condition.
However, Melnik (2012) were investigating how excess intake
of leucine may contribute to T2D, whereas moderate intake of
leucine may be beneficial toward T2D patients. Zhang et al.
(2007) suggested that dietary supplement of leucine improves
glucose and cholesterol metabolism, particularly decreasing
hyperglycaemia and hypercholesterolemia in mice. Although the
paper in question was mainly interested in obesity, there may be
some indication that dietary leucine would help with diabetes.
With high fat diet mice, having leucine in their water supply
lowered the glucose content in their plasma sample after fasting.
Although concentration of insulin was lower in high fat plus
leucine fed mice, the paper claimed that these mice were more
glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive. However, since these tests
were done on healthy mice, more works are needed to test on
diabetic mice.
Another study found that a mixture of protein hydrolysate
and leucine increased insulin level and helped reduce glucose
level in blood plasma (Manders et al., 2006). Their research
indicated that while supplementing with additional leucine
had a distinct advantage on insulin response from healthy
subjects, distinction between the effects of protein supplement
with or without leucine was lost in T2D subjects. It may be
explained by T2D patients already having a decreased insulin
sensitivity. In addition, postprandial glucose response indicated
that both protein supplement with or without leucine supplement
could effectively reduce glucose response in both healthy and
T2D subjects. Therefore, the authors concluded that protein
hydrolysate augments endogenous insulin secretion with or
without additional leucine. However, the authors admitted
that there are still more work to be done to be able to
conclusively indicate that the role of leucine and its role with
diabetes. They pointed out that healthy and diabetic subjects’
plasma glucose responses occur on different scales (i.e., diabetic
subjects have higher plasma glucose responses). Also, they
showed that glucose responses were inversely correlated with
the accompanying insulin responses in patients with T2D.
However, this was expected, for the insulin response in the T2D
patient did not behave like that of control subjects, suggesting
that glucose content measurement should be undertaken on
diabetic patients in parallel to healthy subjects. However, the
author maintained that incorporation of leucine should still
be considered as beneficial toward improving the condition
of T2D.
Although leucine’
s role in blood glucose is somewhat
ambiguous, its role in the positive regulation of mTORC1 is often
mentioned (Manders et al., 2006; Melnik, 2012; Norton et al.,
FIGURE 1 | Leucine influence on T2D (Melnik, 2012).

Millets for Type 2 Diabetes
2012). As mentioned early on in this section, the induction of
mTOCR1 induces insulin production and hence plasma glucose
reduction. It seems to positively correlate with muscle growth,
thus benefiting diabetic patients in terms of retaining muscle
mass (Manders et al., 2006). Although Norton et al. (2012)
suggest that the addition of extra protein from whey or added
leucine increases plasma insulin, one has to keep in mind
that this particular experiment has been conducted on healthy
male mice with a short time scale. So the effect of persistent
leucine supplement on diabetic subject is inconclusive. Yet it
would be prudent to consider Melnik (2012) warning of long
term detrimental effect of excessive leucine intake on pancreatic
β-cells.
One may also need to consider the potential effect of leucine
on different age groups. One study on advanced age male found
that prolonged leucine supplement has no effect on glycaemic
control or muscle mass augmentation (Leenders et al., 2011).
Meanwhile in another study, a high proportion of leucine was
required to stimulate the rate of muscle protein synthesis,
particularly in elderly patients as compared to younger patients
(Katsanos et al., 2006).
Over all, much work is required to be done on the subject of
protein supplementation for patients with T2D. While protein
and amino acids, particularly leucine, have many advantages
in improving the condition of T2D, one has to consider
its implication on pancreatic β-cell senescence subsequently
increasing the dependency of externally supplied insulin.
Therefore, when advising on dietary treatments, considerations
of the present condition of the subject is important to keep in
mind.
Fat/Cholesterol
Fat is an essential part of a healthy diet. Many biological
functions are dependent on fat but as with any other nutrients,
problem arise when it is consumed in excess. In particular,
it increases the risk of blocking blood vessels when these
lipids enter into the blood stream, and the problem gets
further aggravated when coupled with elevated level of glucose
(American Heart Association, 2016). If not controlled carefully,
over accumulation of fat and cholesterol will lead to an increasing
risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), one of the complications
very commonly observed in diabetics. There are three well known
cholesterol and fat, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides
(TG).
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol has been associated with
higher risk for CVD (Marz et al., 2011). It can be caused by a diet
high in trans fats often associated with industrially hydrogenated
vegetable fat as well as from fat of grazing animals (de Souza et al.,
2015; Ganguly and Pierce, 2015). The primary concern with LDL-
C in terms of T2D is that it induces apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells
in vitro (Abderrahmani et al., 2007). Also, Drew et al. (2009)
has discovered in their experiment that higher oxidated LDL-C
reduces insulin secretion in cultured mouse pancreatic β-cells.
Studies show that it will require more than a year of sustained
lifestyle intervention to improve the LDL-C profile (The Look
Ahead Research Group, 2010; Wing et al., 2011). Therefore,
lowering LDL-C is often considered as a target in management
strategy.
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol has been associated with
lowering the risk for CVD. Lowered HDL-C will put one at a
higher risk of CVD, particularly people with T2D (The Look
Ahead Research Group, 2010; Wing et al., 2011). It is particularly
responsive to lifestyle intervention. There are evidences of
HDL-C being able to reduce plasma glucose by intravenous
reconstituted HDL-C (rHDL) to T2D patients (Drew et al.,
2009). The results demonstrated that infusing rHDL into the
patient’
s blood stream led to an increase of β-cell function
and subsequently plasma insulin level. In addition, a recent
article pointed out that HDL-C may have a positive role in
improving β-cell function as well as offering protection against
stress-induced apoptosis (Kruit et al., 2010). While HDL-C
level is generally a good health indicator, there is a scenario
where HDL-C benefits may be inhibited. If the HDL-C is
enriched with triglycerides and depletion in cholesteryl ester with
conformational alternation of apolipoprotein A-1, this will render
HDL-C more likely to be immobilized on arterial wall (Kontush
and Chapman, 2008). Therefore, management strategy have to
consider beyond HDL-C profile alone.
Triglycerides (TG) is known as the most common type of fat in
the body. It is also known that high level of TG is not necessarily
the cause of diabetes but an indicator of an individual at risk
of diabetes (Dansigner, 2015). For an example, reducing TG has
been found to reduce the risk or delay in the onset of T2D (Kruit
et al., 2010). High level of TG have also been linked with higher
incidence of cardiovascular complication, in particular coronary
heart disease in an ethnically Japanese study (Sone et al., 2011).
Therefore, health risk is often associated with high TG level.
Lipid improvement may not have a direct positive effect on
glycaemic index, however, it has the potential to help in reducing
the subsequent complications. As part of a review, Bitzur et al.
(2009) concluded that omega-3 has been shown with the ability to
regulate the balance of LDL, HDL, and TG. Therefore, it has been
successful in correcting dyslipidemia , a condition that reflects
an imbalance between LDL, HDL, and TG, and which is part of
the T2D symptoms that can cause cardiovascular disease events.
These are but a few examples on how diet may improve the
condition of those that have T2D.
Micro- and Anti-Nutrients
Micro-nutrients are nutrients such as minerals and vitamins that
are required in small quantity while being essential for health
(Karunasinghe et al., 2016; Maiti et al., 2016). Anti-nutrients
are often referred to as those that decrease the digestibility of
nutrients (Pal et al., 2016). Little quantification has been made
when it comes to dietary recommendation on micro-nutrients
and anti-nutrients and their effects on T2D.
Several metabolic pathways and cellular reactions in the body
require minerals and vitamins to act as coenzymes and cofactors.
Unlike the previously established notion that their deficiencies
are related to specific diseases, with the progress in nutritional
biology research, it has increasingly become clear that these
micro-nutrients also have the potential to impact on other
chronic ailments such as Types 1 and Type 2 diabetes (Mooradian

Kam et al.
Millets for Type 2 Diabetes
et al., 1994; Franz and Bantle, 1999). Indeed, reports confirm
that micro-nutrients play a part in improving the diabetic
condition (Thorne et al., 1983; Boivin et al., 1988; O’
Connell,
2001; McDougall et al., 2005; He et al., 2007).
Meanwhile, anti-nutrients research has shown that α-amylase
can be inhibited by various plant-derived molecules like luteolin,
polyphenols, as well as amylase inhibitors (Boivin et al., 1988;
McDougall et al., 2005; He et al., 2007). In particular, Boivin
et al. (1988) showed that α-amylase inhibitor can significantly
reduce postprandial glucose peak in both healthy and T2D
subjects. To deter predation, plant α-amylase inhibitor causes the
reduction of starch digestion by acting against animal α-amylase
activity (Singh et al., 2010). However, these inhibitors can be
inactivated/reduced by heat during cooking (Rehman and Shah,
2005). Polyphenols from tea can also help with reducing starch,
lipid, and protein bioavailability, thus reducing excessive amount
of nutrients to be absorbed by the body (He et al., 2007). Others
like anthocyanin which is often found in soft fruits inhibit
α-glucosidase activities (McDougall et al., 2005). This can be
an effective tool to combat T2D, as diabetes is often caused by
overindulgence in food.
In terms of minerals, the best established beneficial effector
for diabetics is supplemental chromium (Cr) (Anderson, 1998;
Anderson, 2000; Sharma et al., 2011; Yin and Phung, 2015).
Diabetics may not show any specific Cr deficiency (Anderson,
1998), but Cr basically acts by creating a better mechanism
for insulin action through improved receptor numbers, binding
ability, phosphorylation and activation (O’
Connell, 2001). The
indirect nature of Cr’
s benefit toward T2D may be the cause of
some contradictory results among studies (Gunton et al., 2005).
In its naturally occurring form, Cr is the active component
of glucose tolerance factor (GTF), which renders Cr into the
most bioavailable and it is safer than its other supplemental
forms like chromium picolinate (Vincent, 2007). Consuming
100 microgram of GTF Cr by consuming whole grains, beans,
nuts/seeds, and mushrooms has been proposed to significantly
alleviate diabetes. Apart from Cr, minerals like zinc, magnesium,
manganese, potassium, and vanadium have also been found
to be essential for T2D patients by controlling glucose and
insulin homeostasis (O’
Connell, 2001; Diabetes.co.uk, 2016d).
Mineral deficiency interferes with the functioning of insulin, thus
affecting the glucose metabolism, and deregulating blood sugar
content.
Besides minerals, vitamins also regulate the activity of insulin
and thus have been promoted as role players in diabetes
management (Pittas et al., 2006, 2007; Pflipsen et al., 2009).
In its most bioavailable and natural form, vitamin E (d-
α-tocopherol) was found to significantly improve glycaemic
control without changing insulin secretion (Paolisso et al., 1993).
Vitamin B12 deficiency has been found to be prevalent (22%)
in T2D populations (Pflipsen et al., 2009). Furthermore, patients
who have diabetes-related CVD also develop the mortality risk
factor, hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcys), characterized by very
high total homocysteine present in the blood plasma leading
to death. Vitamin B6, folic acid (vitamin B9), and vitamin
B12 have been used to decrease levels of plasma homocysteine
and the risk of CVD in Type 2 diabetics (Thornalley and
Rabbani, 2010). Molecules such as inositol, coenzyme Q10 and
carnitine are regulators of various carbohydrate, fatty acid, and
protein metabolism pathways. Although their direct role in
diabetes is still unclear, they may be useful to prevent or help
in several diabetes-associated effects like diabetic ketoacidosis,
diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic neuropathy (Diabetes.co.uk,
2016d). Thus, regular consumption of micro-nutrients in the
form of natural or fortified food or any other intervention
strategies supplementing micro-nutrients should be part of
diabetes management.
Research on Food Processing/Cooking
Methods
Another aspect to consider in dietary intervention is that most
foods consumed are processed or cooked. For example, the
cooking methods as well as the duration and level of heat used
in cooking may change the ratio of different starch fractions
(Snow and O’
Dea, 1981; Anderson and Guraya, 2006; Roopa and
Premavalli, 2008; Chung and Liu, 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). In
addition, the subsequent storage/refrigeration of food has also
been shown to have effects on reduced RDS content (Mishra et al.,
2008). There are some inconsistencies though in such findings.
For an example, a report stated that heating with microwaves
have no significant effect on starch digestibility (Anderson and
Guraya, 2006). While Zhang et al. (2009) showed a different
conclusion where heating has been related with increased RS.
Therefore subsequently, cooking and processing will have an
impact to GI value (Frei et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2004). It is
also important to know that dietary fiber content, tannin and
in vitro protein digestibility of processed grain, all affected by
cooking and processing, can affect GI (Pushparaj and Urooj,
2011).
For an example, grain such as pearl millet is never eaten raw
or as a whole grain. It is milled with the seed coat (rich in dietary
fiber and micro-nutrients) to prepare whole meal flour utilized
in preparation of foods. Commonly used traditional methods
of processing and cooking pearl millet are: milling, roasting,
boiling, pressure cooking, sprouting/germination. Processes such
as fermentation and germination also are known to decrease
the phytate (an anti-nutrient) content by 60% and improve bio-
availability of minerals (Suma and Urooj, 2014). Processing such
as dehulling has been found to cause a significant reduction in
protein, polyphenol and phytic acid content (Pawar and Parlikar,
1990). Fermentation after dehulling can also cause a significant
increase in the in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) from 3 to 14%
(El Hag et al., 2002). However, cooking had little effects on the
total dietary fiber (TDF; Pushparaj and Urooj, 2011). When put
together, all these processes will cause changes in the availability
of various nutrients content and should be considered as part of
the management program.
There is much advice available on diabetics diet, but
little advice in terms of scientific research on methods of
processing/cooking that are most beneficial for diabetics. Some
suggestions such as a research on pressure cooked legume have
found the increase of SDS content at the expense of RDS and
RS (Kasote et al., 2014). While the authors have suggested that

Millets for Type 2 Diabetes
it would benefit people who are suffering from diabetes, one
problem as they have pointed out, that the predicted GI (pGI)
is higher after pressure cooking, which make it less desirable
for diabetics. However, while the SDS, RS and RDS analysis was
well defined in the paper, their pGI was not. Other studies from
rice and millet have also shown increased SDS content after heat
moisture treatment supporting the potential benefit of cooked
grain for diabetics (Anderson and Guraya, 2006; Lehmann and
Robin, 2007).
TRAITS DESIRED IN PLANTS FOR
DIABETIC DIETARY REQUIREMENT
Plant Modification (Breeding and
Transgenic) Toward Targeted Phenotype
Traditional plant breeding has played a key role in improving
plant yield and vigor and recently its emphasis is shifting to
improving nutritional quality too (Khoshgoftarmanesh et al.,
2010; Richards et al., 2010). One of the prime example is the
breeding of soybean (Clarke and Wiseman, 2000). As Clarke
and Wiseman (2000) report, there have been a number of
efforts in breeding soybean to reduce its anti-nutrients content.
By reducing various anti-nutrients compounds the protein
availability in food for human or feed for farm animals has been
substantially improved in this crop. This sets an excellent example
of improving nutritional quality of the crop through selective
breeding.
Efficiency of selective breeding can be further improved using
molecular markers (Yadav et al., 2011, 2013; Varshney et al., 2013;
Thudi et al., 2014; Kale et al., 2015). Marker-assisted breeding
has been developed recently by identifying genomic regions or
even causational genes that led to the development of better
crop in terms of resilience, crop value, and nutritional qualities
(Serraj et al., 2005; Yadav et al., 2011; Varshney et al., 2013,
2014; Thudi et al., 2014). With new marker-assisted technologies,
breeding becomes less time consuming than traditional breeding
and will continue to be a major tool for crop development and
improvement.
There are many markers developed to identify crops with
abiotic/biotic stress resistance and other agronomic traits
including yield (Fan et al., 2006; Jena and Mackill, 2008;
Miedaner and Korzun, 2012; Sharma et al., 2014). There are also
efforts that identified markers showing implication in nutrition
(Muthamilarasana et al., 2016). These markers targets include
proteins (Kumar et al., 2011), minerals (Zhang et al., 2011; Kwon
et al., 2012), sugar/acid (Francia et al., 2005) as well as anti-
oxidants and phenolics (Shao et al., 2010; Torres et al., 2010)
in various crops. Markers that have implication on downstream
food processing such as malting for barley and cooking for rice
are also available (Francia et al., 2005). Collection of such markers
will allow faster developmental time for producing desirable
nutritional traits in various crops.
Various diabetic associations have identified micro-nutrients
and anti-nutrients that influence the speed of digestion or
optimizing nutrition use. Fortifying plants with micro-nutrients
have been the focus of much research to improve nutritional
quality to combat diabetes as well as malnutrition (O’
Connell,
2001; Bouis and Welch, 2010). Much has been done to improve
micro-nutrients content (Cakmak et al., 2010) but more can be
done in targeting marco-nutritional benefits (e.g., carbohydrate,
fat, and protein) for diabetics.
Although less welcomed in the public domain, transgenic
technology is another mean and tool for biofortification of grain
nutritional traits (Pérez-Massot et al., 2012; Galili and Amir,
2013). Galili and Amir (2013) argued that traditional breeding
methods have failed to raise some aspects of nutrition in crop
to a satisfactory level. With continually expending knowledge
and understanding of the biochemical pathways with molecular
control, as well as with improvement of the transgenic technique,
one can argue that genetic modification should be considered
as a viable option. On the other hand, even though transgenic
technology may have its advantages over traditional breeding,
it has its limitations. For an example, one has to consider the
acceptance of the general public, as well as other considerations
beyond the technology itself (Sample, 2012). Examples would
be the legal frame work for this technology to be used on
market products as well as the regulatory framework to conduct
these processes safely. Currently, the additional cost to secure
transgenic trial sites in Europe can exceed the cost of the
experiment itself due to the lack of public support (Cressey,
2012; Kuntz, 2012; The Telegraph, 2015). This in itself has much
to desire as there is little evidence to assess the safety of such
technology due to the lack of public support to explore and
test such technology (Nature Editorial, 2012). Many experiments,
including those for safety assessment, have suffered premature
termination (Pilate et al., 2002; Kuntz, 2012). Perhaps much
transparent process, public education, and campaign are needed
to win over the trust of the general public if this technology is to
be successfully deployed.
Over all, based on the above discussion on nutrition
requirements of diabetics, some of the targeted benefits of
improving staple crops for nutritional traits are clear. Given that
there already exist technologies for crop improvement, we can
start looking more into improving nutritional qualities such as
lipid, fiber, mineral, amino acid and starch contents in our staple
crops.
Millets Benefit for Diabetics
There are many dietary advice and options readily available
for diabetics. Some have even provided advice on food groups
down to grain type (Dansinger, 2016). Recently, millets are
receiving increasing spotlight in combating diabetes as a dietary
option (Henry and Kaur, 2014; Nambiar and Patwardhan, 2014;
Muthamilarasana et al., 2016). Indeed, there are evidences to
support that millets have many properties making it a good
dietary option for diabetics. For an example, an experiment
that has used diabetic mice to test different diets has concluded
that added millet protein can increase insulin sensitivities, and
reduce blood glucose level as well as triglyceride level (Nishizawa
et al., 2009). Added benefits such as increased plasma level of
adiponectin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were also
found in their 3 weeks study.

Millets for Type 2 Diabetes
The cereal crop millet is one of the most abundant crops
grown in India and African continent, and provides a staple
food for many poor communities (Ravi, 2004). Compared to
other cereal crops such as wheat and maize, millets are high
in nutritional content, gluten free, and have low GI (Abdalla
et al., 1998). They provide high energy, high dietary fiber, protein
with balanced amino acid profile, many essential minerals,
some vitamins, and antioxidants (FAO, 1995; Lestienne et al.,
2005; Suma and Urooj, 2012). These play a substantial role
in prevention of many human illnesses such as T2D, cancer,
cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (Kannan, 2010;
Shahidi and Chandrasekara, 2013). There is great potential for
harnessing these positive attributes through selective breeding.
Subsequently, combining grain processing/cooking methods and
food production technologies in producing food product from
such varieties will be directly useful for controlling diabetes
through diets.
There are various species of millets (pearl, foxtail, finger, little
and kodo, just to name a few) growing in various parts of the
world (Ravi, 2004). These millets are known to be able to survive
and produce food in regions that are more prone to drought. The
added benefit for millets is their potential positive contribution
toward controlling the symptoms of diabetes (Choi et al., 2005;
Park et al., 2008; Shobana et al., 2010; Jali et al., 2012). They
are known to have higher SDS (Liu et al., 2006), mineral (FAO,
1995) as well as leucine (Ejeta et al., 1987; FAO, 1995) contents,
that are positively attributed toward healthy diet for diabetics.
Furthermore well characterized genetic, genomic and breeding
methods exist for pearl millet (Yadav et al., 2011; Hash et al.,
2003), providing a head start for breeding program in this crop.
Amongst millets antidiabetic properties, a study in India
reported that patients with T2D fed with foxtail millet for
90 days showed improved glycaemic control as well as other
improvements (Jali et al., 2012). The patients were given the diet
of a combination of foxtail millet, split black gram and spice mix
with a high degree of compliance. The result showed a reduced
HbA1c, fasting glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and
LDL concentrations. These were all indications that this diet had
a positive impact on T2D patients. The reduction of cholesterol,
triglyceride and LDL-C concentration had a positive implication
in cardio health (Marz et al., 2011; Sone et al., 2011; Wing et al.,
2011), a complication that many T2D patients suffered from
(Bitzur et al., 2009). One could argue that the effect of medication
or the more regulated diet could cause an equal positive impact.
However, millet’
s positive role was consistent throughout these
studies. Further, medication has negative side-effects that diet did
not introduce.
Similar research on effects of finger millet on T2D rat had also
been published (Shobana et al., 2010). The study demonstrated
that finger millet may help reduce subcapsular cataract when
T2D mice were fed with added finger millet seeds coat. In this
experiment, Shobana et al. (2010) had also observed the reversal
of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriacylglycerolemia associated
with diabetes. Not only did finger millet had an implication in
diabetics’health but health improvement in general, as many
obese rat subjects had experienced weight loss.
Two studies from the same group on proso- millet and foxtail
millet concluded that diet with mixture of their respective protein
faction improved HDL-C concentration as well as reduced
insulin and plasma glucose concentration (Choi et al., 2005; Park
et al., 2008). Though these were positive results in managing
diabetes, caution have to be exercised that such results were
drawn from protein fraction only and not the whole grain. The
more wholesome properties of the grain such as fat and starch
portion had yet to be investigated. This did not, however, negate
the fact that these millets carried beneficial properties toward
managing diabetes.
Thus, while there are many indications of dietary health
benefits offered by millets in managing diabetes, more research
is required.
CONCLUDING REMARKS/SUMMARY
Much is desired toward developing crop products that can offer
options to treat diabetes through diet. Even more research is
needed for developing crop that can be used as a raw materials
for these dietary products. In light of their benefits, millets hold a
key to the well-being for those who suffer from, and those that are
at risk of, diabetes. More research must be done in establishing
the benefit and the method of deployment of these benefits in
combating the global rising tide of diabetes.
