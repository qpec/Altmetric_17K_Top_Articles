2016; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00354.2015.—Recurrent dehydration,
such as commonly occurs with manual labor in tropical environ-
ments, has been recently shown to result in chronic kidney injury,
likely through the effects of hyperosmolarity to activate both
vasopressin and aldose reductase-fructokinase pathways. The ob-
servation that the latter pathway can be directly engaged by simple
sugars (glucose and fructose) leads to the hypothesis that soft
drinks (which contain these sugars) might worsen rather than
benefit dehydration associated kidney disease. Recurrent dehydra-
tion was induced in rats by exposure to heat (36°C) for 1 h/24 h
followed by access for 2 h to plain water (W), a 11% fructose-
glucose solution (FG, same composition as typical soft drinks), or
water sweetened with noncaloric stevia (ST). After 4 wk plasma
and urine samples were collected, and kidneys were examined for
oxidative stress, inflammation, and injury. Recurrent heat-induced
dehydration with ad libitum water repletion resulted in plasma and
urinary hyperosmolarity with stimulation of the vasopressin (co-
peptin) levels and resulted in mild tubular injury and renal oxida-
tive stress. Rehydration with 11% FG solution, despite larger total
fluid intake, resulted in greater dehydration (higher osmolarity and
copeptin levels) and worse renal injury, with activation of aldose
reductase and fructokinase, whereas rehydration with stevia water
had opposite effects. In animals that are dehydrated, rehydration
acutely with soft drinks worsens dehydration and exacerbates
dehydration associated renal damage. These studies emphasize the
danger of drinking soft drink-like beverages as an attempt to
rehydrate following dehydration.
fructokinase; renal injury; vasopressin; uric acid; stevia
A MAJOR EPIDEMIC of chronic kidney disease is occurring in
Central America among workers in the sugarcane fields. To
date there have been reported to be over 20,000 deaths. While
the etiology is unknown, most studies suggest that recurrent
dehydration is a major risk factor (10, 15, 24, 32).
Subjects working in hot environments tend to lose both salt
and water, but usually have a greater loss of water, leading to
transient hyperosmolarity. Hyperosmolarity activates two ma-
jor systems: vasopressin release from the posterior pituitary
and the aldose reductase enzyme. Vasopressin has been shown
to drive low grade renal injury and to exacerbate chronic
kidney disease in laboratory animals (8). Likewise, the aldose
reductase system converts glucose to sorbitol, which can
then be converted to fructose, which is a substrate for
fructokinase in the proximal tubule (11). In turn, the me-
tabolism of fructose in the proximal tubule can result in
tubular injury and the release of oxidants and inflammatory
mediators (11, 28). Indeed, we recently reported that recur-
rent heat-associated dehydration could lead to chronic kid-
ney disease in mice due to endogenous generation of fruc-
tose in the kidney from the aldose reductase pathway, and
this was prevented in mice unable to metabolize fructose
(fructokinase-knockout mice) (34).
The observation that fructose plays a role in dehydration-
associated renal injury raises major concerns that rehydration
with sugary beverages that contain fructose might worsen
rather than help dehydration-associated renal injury. Further-
more, fructose has a peculiar ability to stimulate vasopressin
release in humans that is not observed with other sugars such
as glucose (42).
We therefore utilized a model of heat-induced dehydration
to test the hypothesis that brief (2 h) rehydration with a soft
drink beverage (consisting of 7.15% fructose-3.85% glucose
similar to standard soft drinks) might worsen renal injury
compared with rehydration with water or stevia containing
water. Our studies raise serious concerns for the common
practice, especially among adolescents and young adults, to
drink soft drinks as a means to quench thirst following an
episode of dehydration.

 nology (Dallas, TX). Antifructokinase (KHK) and antialdose reduc-
tase were obtained from GeneTex (Irvine, CA), antivasopressin V2
receptor antibody was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and
anti-�-actin antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers,
MA). Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
were from Cell Signaling.
Experimental Protocol
Heat-induced dehydration protocol. Three groups of male Wistar
rats were placed in a 36°C closed environment for 1 h without food
and water from Monday to Friday during 4 wk. Thermal exposure is
considered a valid model to induce dehydration in rats (2–6, 29–31).
After heat-induced dehydration, animals were allowed to rehydrate for
2 h with either tap water (W, n � 6), a sweetened beverage made with
an 11% of a fructose-glucose combination, which is a similar com-
position used in major brands of soft drinks (FG, 7.15% fructose and
3.85% glucose, respectively, n � 7) (10, 12), or water sweetened with
the noncaloric edulcorant stevia (ST) (4 g/l water, Svetia, Metco
Mexico, n � 7). Pelleted food was provided ad libitum. For the rest
of the day and during weekends animals received tap water and food
ad libitum. The loss of weight induced by heat and the amount of
drinking fluid consumed during rehydration period were recorded
daily.
Normal control group (C). This group consisted of five male Wistar
rats of similar body weight and age. They received food and water ad
libitum during 4 wk. The amount of water and food consumed were
measured daily. Body weight was measured weekly.
Measurements
At the end of the 4-wk study period, systolic blood pressure was
measured, and urine was collected for 18 h (overnight) in metabolic
cages. Food was not provided during the urine collection. Rats were
then euthanized by anesthesia with isoflurane and exsanguination. A
blood sample was collected and centrifuged. Plasma and urine sam-
ples were frozen until further analyses. Both kidneys were perfusion
washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the right kidney was
excised and divided into cortex and medulla, frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored until further processing. The left kidney was fixed by
perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde for histology.
Blood and Urine Analyses
Plasma and urine osmolality was measured using a freezing point
depression osmometer (Advanced Instruments, Norwood, MA).
Plasma and urine creatinine were measured by a validated enzymatic
method (22) and creatinine clearance was calculated. Plasma and
urine urea nitrogen concentrations were analyzed by autoanalyzer
(Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, MA). Sodium concentration
was analyzed by flame photometry. Fructose was measured by a
colorimetric assay (18), and uric acid was measured with a fluoro-
metric kit (Amplex Red, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Plasma
copeptin was extracted using Sep-pack C18 cartridges (Waters, Mil-
ford, MA) and then measured by a rat-specific competitive enzyme
immunoassay (Peninsula Laboratories, San Carlos, CA).
Solute-free water reabsorption (TcH2O) during the 18 h of urine
collection was calculated accordingly to the following formula:
TcH2O � osmolar excretion � urine volume � (Uosm/Posm) � V �
V, where Uosm and Posm are the urine and plasma osmolality, respec-
tively, and V the urine volume collected in 18 h.
Blood Pressure
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured in conscious rats
by a validated volume-based tail-cuff method (17) at the end of the
follow-up.
Evaluation of Markers of Tubular Damage
For the determination of N-acetyl-�-D-glucosaminidase (NAG)
activity in urine samples, 4-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-�-D-glucosaminide
was used as a substrate.
Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) expression, a
sensitive marker of renal proximal tubule damage (25), was evaluated
by Western blotting. Renal cortex proteins were extracted using a
mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase lysis buffer, as previously
described (33), and incubated with a primary antibody against NGAL
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4°C overnight, using �-actin antibody
(Cell Signaling) as load control.
Renal Cortex Content of Fructose and Uric Acid
Fructose was extracted from cortical renal tissue by perchloric acid
precipitation, and its concentration was measured by the anthrone-
based colorimetric method (18). Uric acid (UA) is a by product of
fructose catabolism in tissues expressing KHK and is associated with
its detrimental effects (21). Therefore, tissue UA was measured both
as a marker of renal damage and also as a surrogate of fructose
increased metabolism. UA was extracted as previously described (11).
UA was measured using Amplex Red assay kit (Life Technologies).
Fructose and UA concentrations were normalized by protein concen-
tration.
Renal Cortex Markers of Oxidative Stress
Tissue was homogenized in phosphate buffer containing a cocktail
of protease inhibitors. Protein carbonyls and lipid peroxidation (4-
hydroxynonenal, 4-HNE) were measured using previously published
methods (27, 39) and normalized by protein concentration.
NOX4, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismu-
tase-1 protein expression. Renal cortex proteins were extracted using
a MAP kinase lysis buffer, as previously described (22). Each of the
following primary antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight: anti-
NOX4 (GeneTex, Irvine, CA), anticatalase, -GPx, and anti-SOD-1.
Protein loading was controlled with and anti-�-actin antibody (Cell
Signaling). Chemiluminescence was captured using Clarity horserad-
ish peroxidase chemiluminescence kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and
exposure of membranes over X-ray film inside a standard developing
cassette. Film was developed manually and exposure was repeated
varying the time as needed for optimal detection; thereafter the film
was scanned. Blots were recorded, and densitometry was performed
using the Image Studio Lite Software (Licor, Lincoln, NE).
Aldose reductase, KHK, and vasopressin V1a and V2 receptors
protein expression by Western blot analysis. Renal cortex proteins
were extracted using a MAP kinase lysis buffer, as previously de-
scribed (33). Each of the following primary antibodies were incubated
at 4°C overnight: anti-KHK (GeneTex, Irvine, CA), antialdose reduc-
tase (GeneTex), antivasopressin V1a receptor (Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology), antivasopressin V2 receptor (Abcam), and anti-�-actin anti-
body (Cell Signaling). Chemiluminescence was recorded and quanti-
fied using the Image Studio Lite Software (Biotech, Lincoln, NE).
Histological Analysis
Fixed renal tissue was embedded in paraffin and processed accord-
ingly. The evaluation was performed blinded. Sections were stained
with periodic acid-Schiff’s stain (PAS). Glomerular changes (glomer-
ulosclerosis or hypoperfusion as evidenced by wrinkling and collapse
of the glomeruli) were qualitatively evaluated. Tubulointerstitial cel-
lular infiltration was studied in PAS-stained sections taking advantage
that the nucleus of inflammatory cells is stained in dark blue. The
number of inflammatory cells were quantified in 20 nonoverlapping
fields at �400 magnification and expressed as positive cells in 20
fields.

RESULTS
Dehydration Protocol
The central hypothesis of this study was that rehydration
with fructose/glucose concentrations similar to that observed in
soft drinks might accelerate heat-induced dehydration renal
injury. Heat-induced dehydration was performed by exposure
of rats daily to heat (1 h at 36°C) followed by 2 h of ad libitum
rehydration with either water of a fructose-glucose (FG) solu-
tion similar in composition to that present in soft drinks. The
rest of the 24-h period all groups only received water for fluid
intake. Because rats drank more FG solution than regular
water, we also included a group given stevia water, as rats
drank the same amount of stevia water as FG water thus
providing a control for fluid intake following the dehydration
procedure. These three groups were than compared with nor-
mal control rats that were not exposed to heat.
Effects on Weight and Fluid Intake
Heat-induced dehydration resulted in equivalent mean daily
body weight loss among the three groups (water, stevia, and
FG) at the end of the heat period (Table 1). During the 2-h ad
libitum rehydration period, rats administered FG and stevia
water drank more fluid (�30%) compared with water alone.
However, total 24-h water intake was similar among the three
groups (Table 1), although it was higher than the normal
control group.
Rehydration With Soft Drinks is Associated With Evidence
for Persistent Dehydration Despite Normal Renal Function
Rats underwent blood testing in the morning after having
ample time to be rehydrated. Despite daily rehydration, rats
that had been exposed to daily heat showed higher mean levels
of plasma and urine osmolarity with higher plasma copeptin
levels compared with normal control rats (Fig. 1). Neverthe-
less, rats hydrated with FG showed significantly higher plasma
and urine osmolality and higher copeptin levels and higher free
water reabsorption by the kidneys despite greater fluid intake
during the 2-h rehydration period (Fig. 1). In contrast, rehy-
dration with stevia water was associated with lower plasma
osmolarity and lower copeptin levels than that observed with
water alone.
Heat-induced dehydration raised absolute sodium urine ex-
cretion and sodium fractional excretion; this effect was en-
hanced in FG-rehydrated group. In contrast, in rats rehydrated
with stevia the rise in sodium excretion, both absolute and
fractional, was prevented (Table 1).
Heat-induced dehydration alone also increased blood pres-
sure compared with normal control rats. Rehydration with FG
did not further raise blood pressure. Stevia rehydration was
associated with lower blood pressure than the group rehydrated
with water (Table 1).
In summary, recurrent and transient heat-induced dehydra-
tion results in some persistent evidence for dehydration (ele-
vations in plasma and urine osmolarity, elevated copeptin
levels) and this is significantly worse in rats rehydrated with
FG solutions.
Renal Injury Induced by Dehydration is Worsened by
Rehydration With Soft Drink
No differences in plasma urea were observed in these four
groups as measured in the fasting morning blood samples.
However, rehydration with FG solutions to heat-exposed rats

 significantly increased plasma creatinine and decreased Cr
clearance (Table 1).
We evaluated two markers of proximal tubule damage: NAG
urine excretion and the expression of NGAL. In rats that
received FG as rehydration fluid there were significant incre-
ments in the excretion of NAG in urine and in NGAL renal
cortex expression. Rehydration with stevia prevented those
changes (Fig. 2A).
We also evaluated whether renal structural damage was
already present. Dehydrated rats with FG rehydration had
significantly more glomerular hypoperfusion and glomerulo-
sclerosis compared with water and stevia rehydration (Fig. 2B).
Mild tubulointerstitial inflammation was also observed in the
group that received FG.
These data document that heat-induced dehydration is asso-
ciated with both structural and urinary biomarker evidence of
renal injury and this is worsened with hydration using FG
solutions.
Potential Mechanisms for Renal Injury: Aldose Reductase-
Fructokinase-Uric Acid Pathway and the Vasopressin
Pathways
We also measured uric acid and fructose as both may be
induced by dehydration [by renal retention of uric acid coupled
with increased generation of both fructose and uric acid via the
aldose reductase pathway (34)]. As expected, heat-induced
dehydration was associated with a numerical rise in plasma
uric acid and a significant rise in urine fructose, although no
change in plasma fructose from normal controls was observed
(Table 1). In contrast, rehydration with FG was associated with
similar rise in plasma uric acid as control heat-dehydrated rats,
but with higher plasma levels, despite that urine levels were
found similar to water rehydrated rats. Stevia-treated rats
showed lower plasma uric acid and comparable levels of
plasma and urine fructose as control rats.
In renal cortex of rats that received water as rehydration
fluid, concentrations of fructose and uric acid were not differ-
ent compared with normal control rats (Fig. 3). On the con-
trary, rats that received FG during rehydration period, a sig-
nificant increment in the concentration of fructose and uric acid
were observed. In stevia-rehydrated groups, fructose and uric
acid renal concentrations remained comparable to water rehy-
drated and control groups (Fig. 3).
As activation of fructokinase-uric acid pathway is associated
with increased oxidative stress via activation of NOX4 (23, 35,
37, 44), we also evaluated lipid peroxidation and protein
oxidation in renal cortex (Fig. 3). Heat-dehydrated rats that
received water as rehydration fluid showed a slight but signif-
icant increment in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in
renal cortex (Fig. 3). The increased content of fructose and uric
acid induced by rehydration with FG was associated with a
significant augmentation in oxidative stress as noted by a
further increase in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation.
Stevia rehydration was associated with lower oxidative stress
compared with FG groups. In agreement with the increment in
oxidative stress observed in dehydrated rats rehydrated with
FG beverage, we also observed significant overexpression of
NOX4 as well as the antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione
peroxidase (GPx), and SOD-1 in the kidneys (Fig. 3).
We also evaluated the renal cortex expression of the en-
zymes involved in fructose-uric acid pathway and vasopressin
receptors (Fig. 4). Rats that the received water as rehydration
fluid showed a slight but significant increment in the expres-
sion of aldose reductase in renal cortex. In parallel to the
further increment in cortex fructose, uric acid and oxidative
stress, the group of dehydrated animals that received FG for
rehydration showed a significant increment in the expression of
fructokinase, vasopressin receptors 1a and 2, and a further
increase in the expression of aldose reductase. In contrast, rats
that received stevia did not showed those changes (Fig. 4).

 DISCUSSION
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the type of
rehydration solution might influence renal outcomes asso-
ciated with recurrent mild dehydration. Specifically, we
hypothesized that short-term rehydration with sugary bev-
erages containing fructose might have adverse effects on the
kidney. To test this hypothesis, we performed studies in a
model of thermal dehydration and compared water, stevia-
containing water, and a solution of fructose-glucose that is
similar in composition to standard soft drinks. The present
study shows that short-term rehydration with a FG sugary
beverage after a mild dehydration stimulates the two sys-
tems that have been implicated in kidney injury, i.e., vaso-
pressin (1) and aldose reductase-fructokinase activities (34).
After rehydration with a fructose-rich beverage, we ob-
served a greater renal oxidative stress and mild renal injury
(glomerular and tubular alterations). In contrast, rehydration
with plain water or with the noncaloric edulcorant stevia did
not produce such deleterious effects.
Fructose is a substrate for fructokinase that is present in the
proximal tubule, and a 60% fructose diet in rats can induce
modest tubular injury (11, 28). Fructose infusion in humans

 can also stimulate vasopressin release, whereas an equimolar
solution of glucose does not (42). Our basic hypothesis was
that recurrent stimulation of these pathways might induce renal
disease and that hydration with fructose-containing solutions
could increase vasopressin release and provide a substrate for
fructokinase that might lead to further renal damage.
The type of rehydration fluid had significant effects on most
of the outcomes. The administration of FG but not that of ST
as rehydration fluid resulted in a further and significant incre-
ment in plasma copeptin. Moreover, rats continued to show
signs of dehydration with higher urine osmolality and in-
creased free water reabsorption, likely due in part to increased
urinary sodium excretion observed in the FG-rehydrated rats.
The evidence for worse dehydration despite increased fluid
intake compared with the water-only group was striking. The
consequence was also a greater renal oxidative stress, renal
tubule injury, and subtle inflammatory infiltration. An addi-
tional marker of renal impairment in fructose-rehydrated rats
was a significant fall in creatinine clearance. This finding
suggests that glomerular filtration was reduced in this condi-
tion. However, it cannot be excluded that the observed differ-
ences in the creatinine clearances are due to different renal
handling of creatinine by organic anion and/or cation trans-
porters (16, 40).

 An effect of a beverage containing simple sugars as replace-
ment fluid was a significant increase in the accumulation of
fructose and uric acid in the renal cortex. In previous studies,
we and others have reported that tissue accumulation of uric
acid is associated with augmented oxidative stress and damage
(12, 26, 35). The results of the present studies are in agreement
with those previous works.
Dehydration tended to increase systemic blood pressure in
W and FG- but not in ST-rehydrated rats. This effect may be a
consequence of increased renal oxidative stress in those groups
(41). Whether this adverse influence of the rehydration fluid on
SBP participated in kidney damage deserves further investiga-
tion.
We have previously shown that recurrent exposure to heat
can induce renal injury through a fructokinase-dependent
mechanism. In that study, the dehydration procedure was
severe (34). We have also shown that a 60% fructose diet
induces renal damage in the course of 8 wk (36). Moreover,
rats that received a similar FG beverage ad libitum developed
mild renal damage; however, those animals ingested �80 ml of
this fluid per day (39) in contrast to the present study in which
rats had a limited consumption of this sweetened beverage (12
ml/day). It was also observed that rats that received a similar
daily amount of fructose/glucose beverage (14 ml/day) but
without dehydration did not develop renal alterations (data not
shown). Therefore, the power of the current study is that the
renal injury was found even with very mild recurrent dehydra-
tion when short-term rehydration with fructose-containing bev-
erages was provided.
An interesting finding in this study was that dehydration was
associated with increased urinary sodium excretion and that
this was worsened by the rehydration with FG. Although
volume contraction is known to cause a prerenal state with a
decrease in fractional excretion of sodium, dehydration-in-
duced hyperosmolarity can cause a mild natriuresis (known as
dehydration natriuresis) (13). The signaling mechanisms (Sgk1
and TonEBP) involved in causing dehydration-induced natri-
uresis are the same as those known to stimulate the aldose
reductase-fructokinase pathway and thus may account for the
potentiation of this mechanism with the FG solutions (13, 43).
It was also observed a significant increase in urinary urea
excretion in FG-rehydrated animals. We do not have a definite
explanation for this effect; however, a mechanism that might
contribute to increased urea excretion could be an overall
increase in proteolytic activity induced by dehydration (9).
Thus cellular dehydration is believed to be a driving force

 behind the severe protein wasting observed within the liver and
skeletal muscles of extremely ill patients (19).
There is evidence that water intake is decreasing in the
general population (20). Taking into account that, at present, a
common practice is to rehydrate with sugary beverages when
the threshold of mild dehydration has been reached (a situation
in which vasopressin secretion is already increased), these
findings might provide evidence for a pathophysiological
mechanism that partially explain the association between sug-
ary beverages consumption and renal damage (7, 14, 38).
Finally, stevia solution used as rehydration fluid prevented
the rise in vasopressin secretion and preserved plasma and
urine osmolality to normal levels. In addition, stevia-rehy-
drated animals had normal blood pressure and no evidence of
renal tubule damage. It is not possible to know if this protective
effect is due to a significantly higher volume ingested for
rehydration in the stevia groups than in the plain water groups
or if it is an effect induced by stevia itself.
In conclusion, this study shows that short-term rehydration
with fructose-containing beverages in rats undergoing mild
recurrent dehydration results in enhanced renal injury in asso-
ciation with greater stimulation of the vasopressin and polyol-
fructokinase pathways. The simultaneous triggering of both
systems was associated with increased urinary concentration,
oxidative stress, renal injury, and systemic hypertension. On
the other hand, increased ingestion of fluids devoid of simple
sugars (plain water or stevia solution) prevented the stimula-
tion of vasopressin induced by mild dehydration.
Perspectives and Significance
This study is relevant to the epidemic of chronic kidney
disease (CKD) in Central America, in which sugarcane and
other workers are developing CDKs associated with recurrent
heat-associated dehydration. However, it may also be an im-
portant factor in the high frequency of CKD that is occurring
in hot climates such as Mexico and the southern United States.
Further studies investigating the mechanisms involved in this
injurious process are warranted in the future.
