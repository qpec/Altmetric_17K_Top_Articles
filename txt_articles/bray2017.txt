 Position Paper
Obesity: a chronic relapsing progressive disease
process. A position statement of the World Obesity
Federation
Received 6 March 2017; accepted 20 March 2017
Summary
This paper considers the argument for obesity as a chronic relapsing disease process. Obesity is viewed from an
epidemiological model, with an agent affecting the host and producing disease. Food is the primary agent, particularly foods
that are high in energy density such as fat, or in sugar-sweetened beverages. An abundance of food, low physical activity and
several other environmental factors interact with the genetic susceptibility of the host to produce positive energy balance. The
majority of this excess energy is stored as fat in enlarged, and often more numerous fat cells, but some lipid may infiltrate
other organs such as the liver (ectopic fat). The enlarged fat cells and ectopic fat produce and secrete a variety of metabolic,
hormonal and inflammatory products that produce damage in organs such as the arteries, heart, liver, muscle and pancreas.
The magnitude of the obesity and its adverse effects in individuals may relate to the virulence or toxicity of the environment
and its interaction with the host. Thus, obesity fits the epidemiological model of a disease process except that the toxic or
pathological agent is food rather than a microbe. Reversing obesity will prevent most of its detrimental effects.
Keywords: Causes of obesity, epidemiology of obesity, pathophysiology, risks of obesity.
Introduction
The question of whether obesity, which affects a large
fraction of the world’s population, should be called a
‘disease’ has sparked controversy for most of the last
century and into the 21st century (1–6). As Faber noted
70 years ago, ‘All disease entities are abstract concepts
created by the human mind’ (7), and this would include
obesity. A timeline for the differences of opinion about
whether obesity is a disease process from 1977 shows
gradual movement towards acceptance of the proposition
that obesity is a disease process (5). In 1977, the American
Health Care Financing Administration decided obesity was
not a disease (5). In 2002, the Japanese Association for the
Study of Obesity published criteria applicable to their
population on criteria for obesity as a disease process (8).
In 2004, the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services
in the USA removed language saying obesity was not a
disease (5). In 2010, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline
(9) used these words to describe obesity, ‘Obesity is defined
as a disease process characterised by excessive body fat
accumulation with multiple organ-specific consequences’.
Only 3 years later, in 2013, The American Medical
Association recognized obesity as a disease (5). This was
followed in short order by a number of other health
professional organizations recognizing obesity as a disease
process, including The American Association of Clinical
Endocrinologists,
the
American
Academy
of
Family
Physicians,
the
American
College
of
Cardiology,
the
American College of Surgeons, the American Society for
Reproductive
Medicine,
the
American
Urological
Association, the Endocrine Society, the Obesity Society, the
Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions
(10) and by World Health Organization, the Food and Drug
Administration and the National Institutes of Health
(11,12). Finally, in 2015, the Nagoya Declaration identified
‘obesity disease’ as a pathological state caused by obesity
and requiring clinical intervention (13).
The
World
Obesity
Federation
is
an
organization
representing professional societies from many countries that
focus on research, education and health care for people with
obesity. The World Obesity Federation has commissioned
this statement to argue for the position that ‘Obesity is a
chronic relapsing disease process’ and to serve as the basis
for their position on this issue.
The chronic and relapsing nature of obesity is illustrated
in Fig. 1 redrawn from the Diabetes Prevention Programme
and Outcomes Study, an on-going study of individuals with
at risk for developing diabetes (14). The initial body mass
index (BMI) of the placebo group was 30.4 kg m�2, and it
showed little change over the 10-year interval. The same is
seen over a 15-year interval in the matched control group with
obesity reviews

 obesity from the Swedish Obese Subjects Study (15). In the
Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Trial that
enrolled people with diabetes and obesity, the initial BMI of
36.0 kg m�2 did not change more than 3% over 10 years (16)
The relapsing nature of this disease process is also seen in
Fig. 1 where the treatment group initially lost over 7 kg and
then slowly regained over 70% of the lost over the next
4 years. This long-term stability of body weight without
treatment intervention suggests the existence of a set point
or settling point mechanism where changes in food intake
are a major driver of the change in body weight (17).
Not only does obesity relapse, but in the early years prior
to the plateau seen in Fig. 1, there is progressive weight gain.
In those who become obese, the increase in weight occurs
over many years. In the The Coronary Artery Risk
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, for
instance, there was a weight gain of 7.8 kg over an 8-year
period in individuals who were aged 18–30 years (18).
One difficulty with weight loss is that it activates a
number of hormonal changes that favour weight regain
(19). One of the most challenging questions remaining to
be solved is why long-term weight loss is so difficult to
sustain and how these compensatory mechanisms can be
disabled or overcome.
Few will argue with the proposition that obesity, or
excess
body
fatness,
whether
estimated
by
skin-fold
thicknesses (20), by weight in relation to height (BMI)
(21), by waist circumference (22) or by more sophisticated
techniques including dual X-ray absorptiometry (23),
magnetic resonance imaging (24) or computed tomography
(25) or other measures poses an increased risk of mortality
and morbidity in individuals with obesity (21,22,26–31).
Obesity also increases healthcare costs for society (32–37).
We will argue that obesity is a disease process in the same
sense that hypertension or hypercholesterolemia is a disease.
Weight, like blood pressure and cholesterol are continuous
variables (Fig. 2).
When each of these variables deviates sufficiently above
the population mean as shown by the vertical dashed line,
it produces a disease; this is called hypertension when blood
pressure is too high, hypercholesterolemia when cholesterol
is too high or obesity when body weight is too high. Obesity
is no different from these other chronic diseases where
short-term treatments do not change the underlying biology
that drives and maintains them. Garrow caught the essence
of obesity when he said that,
Obesity is not a disease which you either do or do not
have: rather it is a continuum, like baldness, in which
the diagnosis is made when some arbitrary diagnostic
boundary is exceeded (38)
The importance of this deviation was captured even
earlier by Dr Malcolm Flemyng when he said more than
250 years ago:
Corpulency, when in an extraordinary degree, may be
reckoned as a disease, as it in some measure obstructs
the free exercise of the animal functions; and hath a
tendency to shorten life, by paving the way to dangerous
distempers (39)
Over the years since then, obesity has been recognized as
a disease process many, many times (1,3,4,40,41).
One concern about labelling obesity as a disease process
is the finding that some people with obesity do not have
any of the risk factors for associated diseases although they
may be victims of stigmatization and at risk for orthopaedic
problems.
These
so-called
healthy
obese
have
no
‘associated’ risk factors such as prediabetes, dyslipidemia,
hypertension or other findings (42). However, it is now
clear from long-term follow-up studies that half or more
of these individuals will develop obesity-related disease
during their lifetime (43). This effect of time on the
expression of risk factors in people with higher body weight
(i.e. obesity) is clearly seen in data from the Framingham
study where the mortality was followed up in 6-year
intervals for 30 years from the initial examinations in
1948–1950. The relative risk of mortality is plotted against
the baseline relative weight (Fig. 3). For the first 12 years,
the heavier group had a lower mortality than lighter
individuals. As time passed, however, the curvilinear
relationship between relative weight and mortality appeared
at 18 years and got progressively stronger (44,45). Hubert
et al. (46) could show that after 26 years, obesity was an
independent risk factor for heart disease. Thus, quoting
from Garrow again, we need to ‘Treat Obesity Seriously’
(38) and provide sufficient time for efforts at prevention
and treatment to work.

 The curvilinear relationship of BMI to body weight
appears to be contradicted by the finding that elderly
individuals and those with specific diseases such as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure, obesity
may contribute to longer life, a finding called the ‘Obesity
Paradox’. The explanation is probably a consequence of
selection bias. A simple way to eliminate this bias is to
ensure that the start of exposure and the start of follow-up
coincide. This is precisely how randomized clinical trials
are typically analyzed: an analysis that selects individuals
free of coronary heart disease 5 years after randomization
and then compares the coronary heart disease incidence
between arms from year 5 onwards would be unacceptable;
similarly for the effect of obesity (47).
An epidemiological model
An
epidemiological
model
for
obesity
as
a
chronic
progressive relapsing disease process is shown in Fig. 4
(48,49). An epidemiological model has an environmental
agent that acts on a host to produce a disease. Disease is
related to the virulence of the agent and the susceptibility
of the host.
The agent
Food is the principal environmental agent for obesity, with a
decline in the level of physical activity being second (50,51).
Tasty, low cost, convenient foods are abundant in the
western diet (52,53). These tasty foods can activate the so-
called pleasure centres of the brain providing pleasurable
rewards from eating (54,55). This centre is the same one
that is activated by substances of abuse (56). At the same
time that tasty foods have become less expensive and more
abundant, physical activity has gradually declined (57)
and together with the abundance of food provide the major
drivers for obesity.

cholesterol and blood pressure (93)

 In addition to food and physical activity, a variety of
other environmental factors such as less sleep time,
endocrine disruptors (also called obesogens) (58), epigenetic
and intergenerational effects, older parental age, certain
medications and reduced smoking have all conspired to
enhance the effects from the main causative agents – tasty
and pleasurable food and low physical activity (59).
The host
Genetic factors
Genetic factors are a component of the host response to the
environmental agents. There are some genes which have
high penetrance and lead inevitably to massive obesity.
Examples would be defects in the production of leptin or a
defective
leptin
receptor,
abnormalities
in
proopiomelanocortin
gene,
or
in
the
melanocortin-4
receptor system (60,61). However, nearly 100 other genes
have been identified that are related to obesity and fat
distribution,
but
with
a
much
smaller
individual
contribution
(62,63).
It
is
clear
that
in
the
same
environment some people become obese and others do
not. Many factors are involved in this differential response,
and some of them have been noted earlier.
Fat cells
For the genetically susceptible host, excess energy from food
leads to an accumulation of fat in fat cells (64,65). The
enlargement and/or increase in number of fat cells to
accommodate this storage of fat are the pathologic lesions
of obesity. The distribution of fat in ectopic regions such
as visceral fat, cardiac fat and fat in muscles may occur as
fat cells reach their maximal storage capacity. Enlarging
fat cells and the microbiome may interact to increase the
inflammatory environment of the host (66).
As the fat cells increase in size, they produce increased
amounts of a variety of peptides, including leptin, cytokines
such as interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha,
angiotensinogen, adipsin (Complement D), metabolites
such as free fatty acids and lactate; concentrations of the
anti-inflammatory
adipocyte
product,
adiponectin
fall
(67). The products of the fat cell in turn modify the
metabolic and inflammatory processes in the host affecting
the brain and peripheral systems alike (64). For the
susceptible host, these metabolic changes lead in turn to a
variety
of
other
processes,
including
dyslipidaemia,
hypertension hyperinsulinemia and diabetes, resulting in
atherosclerosis, and physical stress on bones and joints
(Fig.
5).
However,
not
everyone
with
hypertension
develops a stroke and not everyone who is obese develops
serious outcomes. From this epidemiological perspective,
we conclude that obesity is a disease process in the same
way that atherosclerosis and hypertension are diseases
and
that
like
these
diseases
may
require
long-term
treatment.
The pathologic changes associated with obesity:
the disease process
The enlarged fat cells produce the physical signs of obesity.
The metabolic consequences of obesity result from the
cytokines released from fat cells and from the inflammatory
environment in which they live.
Figure
5
provides
a
model
of
the
intermediary
mechanisms for each of the major manifestations of obesity
that we will deal with subsequently, including diabetes
mellitus, myocardial infarction, hypertension and stroke,
some forms of cancer, sleep apnea, gallstone disease,
osteoarthritis,
neurodegenerative
diseases
and
stigmatization.
Two types of functional impairments are associated
with the increased size and mass of fat cells in obesity.
The first are those related to the fat mass such as
osteoarthritis
(29),
sleep
apnea
(68–70)
and
the
psychosocial responses to the individual with obesity (29).
The
second
are
the
metabolic
and
inflammatory
consequences resulting from the excessive secretion of
products by the enlarged fat cell (64) and ectopic deposition
of lipid (71).
Leptin is one of many proteins secreted in larger amounts
by enlarging fat cells. Leptin deficiency, a recessively
inherited genetic disease, produces massive obesity in
human beings and animals as its principal sign and
symptom (60,61). The increased concentration of free fatty
acids, which also rises as the size of the fat cell increases,
probably produces alterations in insulin clearance by the
liver and the altered metabolism of cholesterol in the liver
that lead to the increasing risk of diabetes and gall bladder
disease in the obese (72).

 For all of these pathologic states, the relationship between
increasing body weight or BMI and disease is curvilinear.
That is, as body weight or BMI increase, the risk for
diabetes
(73,74),
gall
bladder
disease
(29,72),
cardiovascular disease and cancer increases as the excess
weight deviates ever more from the median (Fig. 2). A study
of BMI and mortality carried out by pooling many studies,
mainly from Europe (26), showed that the optimal BMI
for lowest mortality was between 22.5 and 25 kg m�2.
For each increase of 5 BMI units, total mortality rose by
30%, chronic kidney disease by 60% and diabetes mellitus
by 120%. This relationship between BMI and risk for death
has been confirmed repeatedly (27,28). BMI is one predictor
of risk and body fat another. When these two were
examined
together
in
a
large
Canadian
population
assembled from people who had dual X-ray absorptiometry
to measure bone mineral density, Padwal et al. (75) found
that
low
BMI
and
high
body
fat
percentage
are
independently associated with increased mortality that
may help explain the counterintuitive relationship between
overweight and obesity.
Diabetes mellitus
Obesity is one of the strongest predictors of type 2 diabetes
(76). Development of type 2 diabetes thus depends on
changes in one or both of these two principal variables –
insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. Obesity can modify
one or both of these variables (73).
In the individual with diabetes, the mass of beta-cells is
reduced, probably by apoptosis. In addition, chronic
exposure
to
high
levels
of
glucose
may
blunt
the
responsiveness of these cells to incretins (73) and thus their
ability to keep up with the demand for insulin to facilitate
glucose uptake peripherally. Multiple factors contribute to
the failure of the beta-cell including resistance to incretin
hormones (GIP and GLP-1), lipotoxicity, glucotoxicity,
ageing, genetic abnormalities, increased secretion of islet
amyloid
polypeptide,
reactive
oxygen
stress
and
inflammation (73).
Epigenetic factors
The intrauterine environment provides a mechanism that
predisposes some people with obesity to develop diabetes
later in life. Individuals who were malnourished while in
utero may be more prone to weight gain, insulin resistance,
beta-cell failure and hence diabetes than those who are well
nourished, a hypothesis known as the ‘Developmental
Origin of Disease’ or the ‘Barker Hypothesis’ (77). Maternal
undernutrition
forces
the
fetus
to
adapt
during
its
intrauterine development and drives a reprogramming of
its
endocrine–metabolic
state
to
produce
permanent
changes in the structure and the physiology of key organ
systems (77,78). These changes in low-birth-weight infants
(normal range, 3,000–4,000 g) contribute factors to chronic
diseases such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease,
stroke and hypertension in adult life (79).

 Cancer
Obesity predicts the development of some forms of cancer,
particularly in women (80). Oestrogen production by
adipose tissue and the associated risk of endometrial and
breast cancer is well known. In post-menopausal women,
adipose tissue is the major source of oestrogenic compounds
because the ovaries no longer produce oestrogens (Fig. 5). In
addition, the growth factors produced by adipose tissue
such as fibroblast growth factor-21, nerve growth factor,
transforming growth factor-β and vascular endothelial
growth factor, as well as insulin, may also participate in
the growth of cells that eventually become malignant
contributing another component to the risk for diverse
forms of cancer in the individual who is obese (81)
Hypertension, stroke and cardiovascular disease
Hypertension, stroke and cardiovascular diseases are also
increased in obesity (82). Several mechanisms may be
involved in the development of hypertension, stroke and
cardiovascular
disease
in
these
patients.
The
pro-
inflammatory
and
pro-thrombotic
adipokines
may
contribute to increased cardiovascular disease risk (83).
Increased vascular volume, greater arterial resistance and
the release of angiotensinogen from enlarged fat cells may
contribute to the higher blood pressure.
Sleep apnea
The prevalence of sleep apnea is increased in the patient with
obesity (69). Accumulation of fat in the pharynx is a major
risk factor for development of sleep apnea that occurred in
80% of the participants enrolled in the Sleep AHEAD sub-
study of the Look AHEAD Trial (84). In severe cases, ‘obesity
hypoventilation’ can develop, which is a debilitating state of
intermittently impaired consciousness, exemplified by Joe in
Dickens’ Pickwick papers.
Gallstone disease
Gallstonediseaseismoreprevalentinthepatientwithobesity.
Increasing body fat increases the turnover of cholesterol (85)
suchthateachkilogrammeofextrabodyfatproducesanextra
20 mg of cholesterol each day that must be secreted through
the biliary tree. For individuals with a tendency to gall stone
formation, this extra load of cholesterol from increased fat
may be the tipping point for the development of stone
formation and gall bladder disease (86).
Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is more prevalent in people who are obese (87).
This can involve both weight bearing and non-weight bearing
joints, suggesting thatthe pathophysiologymust involve both
the increased body mass (Fig. 5), circulating adipokines,
inflammatoryfactorsorotherpathophysiologicmechanisms.
Stigmatization
Body size provides a visual read-out to the observing
individual about the size of the person they are seeing.
Many people with obesity do not perceive their enlarged
size, but this is readily perceived by external observers and
plays a dominant role in the stigmatization of obesity in
children (88) and adults (89) by both the general public
and by health professionals alike. This may lead to
discrimination and contribute to depression and anxiety.
Conclusions
Although obesity is a non-communicable disease process,
the epidemiological model of obesity described earlier tells
us that it has a number of features in common with a
‘communicable disease’ including environmental agents,
and the host responses to these agents. Just as infectious
diseases have been controlled primarily by change in the
environment such as improved sanitation, control of the
obesity epidemic should start by controlling the virulence
of environmental agents, which can be carried out by a
collaboration
of
obesity
professionals,
local
health
environmental authorities and industry. Early diagnosis
and treatment of childhood obesity could be considered
similar to vaccination, by targeting individuals from the
day of birth. A healthy body weight and healthy lifestyle
should be implemented from early stages in life. For
preventing damage to the host from obesity, medical
personnel play an important role in the evaluation and
treatment of the comorbidities in people with obesity.
Continuous effort is needed to control obesity because it
is a relapsing disease process. There are many background
genetic factors related to body weight and body fat that
modify
the
responses
to
the
tasty,
inexpensive
and
convenient food in the environment. Removing barriers to
physical activity provides an additional approach that may
be analogous to the use of antibiotics for infectious diseases.
With continuous and comprehensive efforts, the obesity
epidemic will be gradually brought under control.
The World Obesity Federation takes the position that
obesity is a chronic, relapsing, progressive disease process
and
emphasizes
the
need
for
immediate
action
for
prevention and control of this global epidemic.
