Background.
Chronic inflammation, as defined by persistent immune activation, is associated with adverse clinical outcomes.
People who inject drugs (PWID) have evidence of persistent immune activation. Here, in a cohort of PWID with or without hepatitis
C virus (HCV) infection, we sought to dissect out the contribution of chronic HCV infection (common in PWID) from the effects of
injection drug use itself.
Methods.
Four groups of study volunteers were recruited: group 1 comprised active PWID; group 2, individuals who ceased
injecting drugs 1–2 months before recruitment; group 3, individuals who ceased injecting drugs 3–4 months before recruitment;
and group 4, healthy volunteers. Soluble and cell-associated markers of immune activation were quantified.
Results.
HCV-viremic PWID have elevated levels of immune activation when compared to healthy volunteers. Cessation of
injection drug use results in a decline in immune activation in the absence of HCV viremia, while HCV-viremic individuals who
previously were PWID continue to harbor elevated levels of immune activation, as defined by increased levels of soluble CD14 and
tumor necrosis factor α and by the presence of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
Conclusions.
Immune activation, a well-defined surrogate of poor clinical outcome that is elevated in PWID, can regress to nor-
mal levels in former injection drug users who are HCV aviremic. Therefore, enhanced harm-reduction efforts should incorporate
aggressive treatment of HCV infection.

HCV infection; injection drug use; immune activation.
Immune activation, mediated by the elaboration of proinflam-
matory cytokines, plays a direct role in the development and
progression of chronic disease states, including atherosclerosis,
diabetes, and cancer, as well as manifestations of aging [1–3].
Immune activation is associated with chronic hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection, a condition common in people who inject
drugs (PWID) [4]. Microbial translocation, as evidenced by
increased levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14), is associated with
cirrhosis and increased mortality in patients with chronic
HCV infection [5]. More recently it has been observed that T
cells of HCV-monoinfected and HCV-coinfected individuals
exhibit shortened telomere lengths and accelerated immune
senescence, a sign of chronic immune activation [6]. Clinical
manifestations of immune activation during chronic HCV in-
fection include myriad extrahepatic manifestations, such as vas-
culitis, arthritis, Sjorgren-like sialadenitis, and renal disease [7].
The long-term consequences of immune activation associated
with HCV are less well defined.
The link between immune activation and adverse clinical
outcomes has been most clearly described in individuals with
chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infec-
tion [8].During the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral
Therapy (SMART) trial, subjects in the intermittent therapy
arm experienced a higher rate of all-cause mortality [9, 10].
Higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP),
interleukin 6 (IL-6), and d-dimer at study entry were associated
with this observation. Furthermore, post hoc analyses have re-
vealed a strong association between sCD14, a marker of activa-
tion of the innate immune system [11], and the risk of death
[12]. Finally, in addition to identifying soluble markers of in-
flammation as predictive of all-cause mortality, it was recog-
nized early in the course of the HIV-1 epidemic that
expression of CD38, a marker of T-cell activation, on both
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was an independent risk factor for dis-
ease progression [13].
Previously, we reported on a pilot study investigating im-
mune activation in HIV-1–infected PWID. Specifically, we
measured levels of immune activation in the blood and the gas-
trointestinal lymphoid tissue in a cohort of HIV-1–infected
PWID and compared these parameters to those in healthy

 volunteers and HIV-1–infected non-PWID [14]. We found
high levels of CD38 expression on CD8+ T cells and increased
levels of sCD14 in the blood and gastrointestinal tissue of HIV-
uninfected PWID, compared with healthy volunteers. However,
our data were confounded by the high prevalence of HCV sero-
positivity in the PWID group. As a result, we were unable to dis-
tinguish between the effects of injection drug use and active
chronic HCV infection on the immune system [15]. However,
our pilot study indicated operational feasibility and allowed us
to design the present study, in which we have systematically
distinguished between the effects of IDU and active HCV
infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to do so.
Herein, we have examined markers of immune activation in
active PWID and compared them to individuals who ceased
injection behavior 1–2 months and 3–4 months before study
recruitment. In addition, healthy volunteers were recruited
and similarly studied. This cross-sectional approach was one
way of disentangling the effects of nonsterile injection from
chronic infection with HCV as we posited that the background
of HCV infection would be similar in the subjects with behav-
ioral change (ie, those who had ceased injection behavior). In
doing so, we would be able to understand the relative contribu-
tions of chronic infection with HCV and active injection of
heroin on immune activation as reflected by the measurement
of markers of immune activation in the blood and tissue.
METHODS
Study Participants and Procedures
Our multidisciplinary cross-sectional study consisted of 4
groups. Forty-eight subjects who injected heroin at least 3
times a week were enrolled in the active injection drug use
group (group 1). They were HIV-1 uninfected, had no evidence
of coagulopathy or any other gastrointestinal disease that would
prevent biopsy, had adequate venous access for phlebotomy
from a vein on an upper extremity, had a positive screening
urine test for opiates (One Step Opiate Single Drug Test, Inno-
vacon, San Diego, California), and had recent sites of drug in-
jection by needle on examination, as well as tracks on
extremities consistent with chronic injection drug use. The pa-
tients were ruled out for acute and chronic HIV-1 infection by
negative results for plasma HIV-1 RNA by polymerase chain re-
action (Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test
v 2.0, Branchburg, New Jersey) and rapid enzyme immunochro-
matographic assay for HIV-1 antibodies (OraQuick Advance,
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania), respectively. Forty-eight study sub-
jects who had ceased injection behaviors for 1–2 months
(group 2) and 3–4 months (group 3) were subsequently recruit-
ed and matched to group 1 for age, sex, and race/ethnicity
(Table 1). Entry criteria were identical as described for the
first group; however, results of urine testing for opiates were re-
quired to be negative at screening, and subjects had no evidence
of recent injection on examination. Additionally, these subjects
also underwent urine testing for opiates on the day of sigmoido-
scopy to confirm cessation of drug use. These individuals were
also tested for HIV-1 solely with point-of-care rapid tests. Eigh-
teen subjects from group 1 who ceased injection drug use were
included in either group 2 (n = 7), group 3 (n = 2), or both
(n = 9). Forty-eight healthy volunteers (group 4) were recruited
from the Rockefeller University Clinical Research Support Of-
fice Recruitment Data Base. All subjects were seen at Rockefeller
University Hospital and gave written informed consent. Phle-
botomy was performed as previously described [16]. The trial
was registered with clintrials.gov (clinical trials registration
NCT01831284).
Soluble Markers of Immune Activation
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to
measure plasma sCD14 levels, using the Quantikine human
sCD14 detection kit (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, Minneso-
ta); hs-CRP levels, using the Quantikine human c-reactive pro-
tein detection kit (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota);
and IL-6 levels, using the human IL-6 ELISA kit (Thermo Sci-
entific, Pierce Biotechnology Rockford, Illinois). Remaining cy-
tokine levels were measured using the Bio-Plex Pro Human
Cytokine Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, California). IL-6 levels
were measured singly and by multiplex.
Cellular Markers of Immune Activation
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed
immediately after isolation by flow cytometry. Antibodies
directed against cell-surface markers, including CD3, CD4,
CD8, CD45RA, CD38, and HLA-DR, were used, and stained
cells were analyzed on an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, California), using multiparameter flow cytometry [16].
Flow cytometric data was analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree
Star, Ashland, Oregon).

 Statistical Analysis
Mixed-effects regression models with random intercepts to
account for participation in >1 group among 27 participants
(ie, repeated measures) were used to compare study groups on
markers of immune activation [17,18].Comparisons were made
conditional on HCV load, a potential confounder. Single-step
adjustments for multiple testing were made to control family
wise error rate, using the R multcomp package [19]. A small
amount of missing data (10 of 1152 [<1%] immune activation
marker results) were excluded from analysis. A priori calculations
determined that power was 80% to detect a difference of 0.58
standard deviations between 2 study groups (eg, active injectors
and controls). All tests of statistical significance were 2-tailed, and
a P value of < .05 was considered significant. The R statistical
computing environment was used for all analysis [20].
RESULTS
Study Participants and Patient Disposition
Three hundred fifty-four subjects entered screening, with a
screen failure rate of 27%. The overall retention rate between
screening and study was 86%.
Study subjects were well matched across groups 1–3 (Table 1).
Group 4 subjects, although comparable in age and sex, were
more likely to be African American. Study subjects were subse-
quently classified as HCV infected and viremic, HCV-infected
and aviremic due to spontaneous control, and HCV uninfected
(Table 1). As these subjects were recruited and studied prior to
the availability of directly acting agents to treat HCV infection
with high remission rates, all aviremic HCV-infected individu-
als controlled HCV spontaneously. The spontaneous control
rate overall was 29.7%, consistent with previous reports [21].
Importantly, the relative numbers of HCV-viremic and avire-
mic subjects in each study group was comparable and lacked
statistical significance (Table 1). Levels of HIV viremia were
comparable in groups 1, 2, and 3 (Mean (+ SD) 5.8 (+ 1.1),
5.9 (+ 1.0), 5.8 (+ 0.8) log10copies/mL plasma, respectively;
Figure 1, Table 1).
Active injectors reported injecting heroin approximately 3
times daily on 24 out of the previous 30 days on average. Injec-
tion of heroin and cocaine was less frequent and occurred on 7
of the previous 30 days on average, and the mean frequency of
injection was twice daily.
Soluble Markers of Immune Activation
As detailed above, we measured multiple soluble markers of im-
mune activation either singly by ELISA or by multiplex. Formal
analyses of results were performed if at least 50% of the individ-
uals in the active injector group had levels of a particular cyto-
kine that was above the level of detection. Cytokine levels that
were at or below the level of detection in ≥50% of the active in-
jectors included IL-6, interleukin 12p70, interleukin 15, inter-
leukin 1β, interleukin 2, and interleukin 4.
Levels of sCD14 were measured by ELISA (Supplementary
Figure 1A) in all subjects. We initially compared mean levels
of sCD14 across groups. The mean sCD14 level was 1700 ng/
mL in group 1 subjects, significantly higher than that measured
in healthy volunteers (1388 ng/mL; P < .001), confirming our
previous findings. Mean levels of sCD14 in groups 2 and 3
were 1724 and 1649 ng/mL, respectively, and not statistically
different from those in active injectors or from one another.
However, when we subsequently compared subgroups based

 on the presence or absence of HCV viremia, a different picture
emerged (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C). In
those without measurable HCV viremia, a clear effect of ceasing
injection behaviors was seen (Supplementary Figure 1C). Mean
levels of sCD14 were 1799 ng/mL in aviremic active injection
drug users, 1616 ng/mL in group 2 aviremic subjects (P = .055),
and 1564 ng/mL in group 3 aviremic subjects (P = .002). Of note,
mean levels of sCD14 in group 3 aviremic individuals were com-
parable to that measured in group 4 (P = .106). In contrast, in
HCV viremic individuals (Supplementary Figure 1B) mean levels
of sCD14 in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 1601, 1796, and 1730 ng/mL
respectively. There was no significant difference between these
levels, and all were significantly elevated when compared to
those in healthy volunteers.
Levels of TNF-α were similarly measured (Table 2 and Sup-
plementary Figure 2). The association of lower mean levels of
TNF-α with the discontinuation of injection behavior was
seen most clearly in the subjects who are HCV aviremic (Table 2
and Supplementary Figure 2C). Mean levels of TNF-α were
10.8 pg/mL in aviremic group 1 subjects, >6.1 pg/mL in avire-
mic group 2 subjects (P = .002), and 5.6 pg/mL in aviremic
group 3 subjects (P < .001). HCV viremia masked an effect on
changes in injection behavior, as mean TNF-α levels were 10.7,
12.8, and 10.6 pg/mL in the 3 subgroups respectively (Table 2
and Supplementary Figure 2B).
Levels of hs-CRP were highly variable and not statistically
different between active injectors, healthy volunteers and
groups of subjects who had ceased injection behavior (Table 2
and Supplementary Figure 3A). Active injectors without HCV
viremia had significantly higher mean levels of hs-CRP as com-
pared to aviremic group 2 subjects (6382 ng/mL vs 3342 ng/mL;
P = .036; Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 3C); however, no
statistically significant difference was seen between aviremic
group 1 and aviremic group 3 subjects (P = .16). No differences
were seen in levels of hs-CRP between groups in viremic
subjects (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 3B).
There were no statistically significant differences between
active and former injectors when assessing levels of interferon
γ, interleukin 10, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α
(data not shown).
Cellular Markers of Immune Activation
Coexpression of CD38 and HLA-DR were measured on CD4+
and CD8+ T cells derived from all subjects. We found that active
injectors had higher mean percentages of CD38+HLADR+ cells
among CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, compared with those measured
in healthy volunteers (4.6% and 6.0% vs 2.4% and 4.5%, respec-
tively; P < .001 for both comparisons; Supplementary Figures 4A
and 5A).
In all patient groups, levels of activated CD4+ T cells in HCV-
viremic subjects were statistically significantly higher than levels
in aviremic subjects (Table 2 and Supplementary Figures 4B and
4C; P < .001 for all comparisons). When HCV viremia was pre-
sent, the mean levels of activated CD4+ T cells in groups 1, 2,
and 3 were not substantially different (Table 2 and Supplemen-
tary Figure 4B). When HCV viremia was not detectable (Table 2
and Supplementary Figure 4C), mean levels of activated CD4+
T cells were 3.9%, 2.2% and 2.3% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respec-
tively, with group 1 having significantly higher levels than both
group 2 (P < .001) and group 3 (P < .001). Levels in groups 2
and 3 approximated that measured in group 4. Levels of activat-
ed CD4+ T cells were correlated with injection frequency in
those who were aviremic (r = 0.49, P = .015). This was not
seen in the viremic subjects (r = −0.08, P = .725).
Mean levels of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ were 6.4% and 5.5%
in viremic (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 5B) and aviremic
(Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 5C) active injection drug
users, respectively (P = .035), and were also statistically signifi-
cantly higher than that in healthy volunteers (4.5%; P < .001 for
both comparisons; Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 5A).
HCV-viremic individuals who had ceased injection behavior
had markedly significantly higher mean levels of activated
CD8+ T cells as compared to subjects within those groups
who were HCV aviremic (P < .001 in both comparisons); how-
ever, when compared to HCV-viremic active injectors, mean
levels in HCV-viremic group 2 and 3 subjects were not

 significantly different (5.5% and 6.5%, respectively). In the
groups of subjects who had ceased injection behavior and
were HCV aviremic (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 5C),
mean levels of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells were 3.7% in
group 2 and 3.6% in group 3, with both values significantly
lower than that in aviremic group 1 subjects (5.5%; P < .001
for both comparisons). There were statistically significant
lower levels of CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells in aviremic sub-
jects in groups 2 and 3, compared with that in group 4 (P = .013
and P = .001, respectively). Levels of activated CD8+ T cells did
not correlate with injection frequency.
DISCUSSION
Here, we have sought to probe the intersection of injection drug
use, chronic infection with HCV, and immune activation. Our
previous finding of increased immune activation in blood and
tissue in HIV-1–uninfected injectors in a small pilot project
that led to this study was generally thought to be due in large
part to the high frequency of HCV infection in the study par-
ticipants, and our contention that it could be due to active in-
jection was difficult to document [14].
Importantly, we have discovered that, in the absence of vire-
mic HCV infection, select cell-associated and soluble markers
of immune activation are higher in active injectors, compared
with those who have recently ceased injection behaviors. Further-
more once HCV-aviremic individuals cease injection behaviors,
select markers of immune activation approximate that measured
in the healthy volunteers. Finally, HCV infection is associated
with activation of the immune system and the presence of vire-
mia masks the beneficial effects of behavioral change.
Importantly, increased levels of sCD14 [5, 12, 22] and TNF-α
[23] have been associated with increased morbidity and mortal-
ity. Our observations are novel and strongly support our con-
tention that nonsterile injection of illicit drugs, here heroin or
heroin and cocaine, is associated with immune activation that,
over time, may result in previously unappreciated complications
of injection behavior, such as cardiovascular disease or damage
to other organ systems.
Harm reduction directed at injection drug use emphasizes
acute issues—infection, overdose, HIV-1 infection, and HCV
infection. However, we believe we have identified potentially
chronic complications of injection drug use that may be of con-
sequence and, if shown to be the case in larger cohort studies,
should perhaps be included in harm reduction messages.
With the caveat that we have only shown associations be-
tween biomarkers and behaviors, there are potential mecha-
nisms at play, here. Active injection, being nonsterile, likely
results in the injection into the circulation of immunostimula-
tory microbial products, which activate innate immune cells
and result in the shedding and secretion of sCD14 [24, 25].
TNF-α, an acute-phase reactant, produced by macrophages
and monocytes is associated with pleotropic, NF-κB–dependent
immunological effects. TNF-α activates multiple cell types (such
as antigen-presenting cells, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, and
neutrophils) and also has potent immunosuppressive effects
(such as cellular apoptosis and lymphopenia) [26]. In HCV-
infected patients, TNF-α is related to higher alanine aminotrans-
ferase levels, advanced histological activity [27],and reduced viral
clearance in response to interferon-based regimens [28].Elevated
TNF-α levels have been observed with injection drug use, both in
HIV-1–infected and uninfected individuals [29], although the
relative effects of HCV and injection drug use on TNF-α have
not been studied to date.
The level of hs-CRP, yet another acute-phase reactant
produced by hepatocytes in response to macrophages, is re-
duced in patients with HCV infection [30, 31], perhaps due
to impaired hepatocyte production of hs-CRP [30]. In con-
trast, hs-CRP levels are elevated in PWID—users of both co-
caine [32] and opioids [33]—likely reflecting injection drug
use/opiate/cocaine-related immunostimulation. Accordingly,
in our cohort, active injectors without HCV viremia had
significantly higher mean levels of hs-CRP as compared to
control subjects, while no significant differences in hs-CRP
levels were observed between HCV-viremic active injectors
and controls.
Here, we have also studied the expression of CD38 and HLA-
DR on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CD38, an ADP ribosyl cyclase
[34], is a marker of T-cell activation, with effects on cell adhe-
sion and signal transduction. HLA-DR, the major histocompat-
ibility complex class II cell surface receptor, is expressed on
activated T cells [35] and provides evidence of T-cell stimula-
tion. We found a striking increase in cells coexpressing CD38
and HLA-DR in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in HCV-positive
active injectors, compared with normal volunteers. In the
absence of HCV viremia, the levels of CD38+HLA-DR+ T
cells decreased following cessation of injection drug use. In con-
trast, in HCV-viremic subjects, high levels of activated T cells
persisted even following discontinuation of injection drug use.
These data strongly suggest a role for both HCV and injection
drug use in the cellular activation of lymphocytes. Interestingly,
we saw a correlation between injection frequency and levels of
activation in CD4+ T cells in HCV-aviremic subjects, again sug-
gesting that, when HCV is not masking the effects of injection,
cellular activation is proportional to injection behavior. We
hope to better understand potential mechanisms with the
study of select subjects in whom longitudinal samples were
collected by gene expression profiling.
Together, the present data provide a picture of heightened
immune activation in PWID with concomitant HCV infection.
Given our current understanding of the deleterious effects of
chronic immune activation, we propose that there are likely
long-term benefits resulting from aggressively treating HCV in-
fection. A study measuring the immune effects of treating HCV
with direct-acting agents is in progress to assess the immediate

 immunological effects of treating HCV in both active and
former injection drug users.
We believe our findings have important public health conse-
quences. First and foremost, cohort studies probing the poten-
tially harmful effects of immune activation caused by chronic
injection drug use should be considered, particularly in HCV-
aviremic and uninfected individuals. Efforts to encourage cessa-
tion of injection behaviors need to be intensified, with a new
understanding of the potential long-term deleterious effects,
such as immune activation. Second, individuals with chronic
HCV infection should be treated aggressively with direct-acting
agents, not only to treat hepatic complications of HCV, but also
to prevent the complications of systemic immune activation.
Such consequences, well documented in HIV-1–infected indi-
viduals, may also be true for those with chronic HCV infection.
Prevention of long-term complications of immune activation
may provide additional rationale in the cost-benefit analyses
of these expensive medications. However, aggressive therapy
of chronic HCV infection should also be accompanied by
heightened harm-reduction efforts, not only to prevent reinfec-
tion but also to reduce immune activation associated with
ongoing injection behaviors.
We must temper our conclusions with these caveats. Our
findings are based on a relatively small cohort, given the num-
ber of viremic and aviremic individuals in each of the study
groups. Our results are therefore of interest but require confir-
mation in larger numbers of subjects. We cannot rule out direct
effects of the drugs of abuse as mediators of immune stimula-
tion, as opposed to the nonsterile injection of heroin and co-
caine. It is noteworthy that the frequency of methadone use
among individuals in study groups 1, 2, and 3 was comparable;
this would suggest that, at a minimum, our observations of dif-
ferences between groups are unlikely to represent selective ef-
fects of opioids. Furthermore, we did not find universal
elevation of levels of markers of immune activation. For exam-
ple, levels of IL-6, a commonly measured cytokine that, when
present at elevated levels, is associated with increased mortality
and morbidity in individuals with HIV-1 infection, among
other conditions, were not elevated in our study subjects. Al-
though this and other cytokines may be produced excessively,
they may be active locally in tissue and cleared from the system-
ic circulation rapidly, accounting for our findings. Finally, al-
though we have documented an association between injection
drug use and select markers of immune activation, we have as-
sumed that complications of immune activation seen in other
disease states may apply here.
In closing, we have documented a clear immunostimulatory
effect of both injection drug use and chronic HCV infection on
select immune parameters, both cell associated and soluble. Be-
havioral change is associated with normalization of select pa-
rameters in the absence of HCV viremia. However, behavioral
change in the presence of HCV viremia is not. The clinical
significance of these provocative findings requires further
study in larger cohorts of relevant study subjects over the long
term.
