IMPORTANCE In locally advanced pancreatic cancer, the role of chemoradiotherapy is
controversial and the efficacy of erlotinib is unknown.
OBJECTIVES To assess whether chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival of patients with
locally advanced pancreatic cancer controlled after 4 months of gemcitabine-based induction
chemotherapy and to assess the effect of erlotinib on survival.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS InLAP07,aninternational,open-label,phase3randomized
trial,449patientswereenrolledbetween2008and2011.Follow-upendedinFebruary2013.
INTERVENTIONS In the first randomization, 223 patients received 1000 mg/m2 weekly of
gemcitabine alone and 219 patients received 1000 mg/m2 of gemcitabine plus 100 mg/d of
erlotinib. In the second randomization involving patients with progression-free disease after
4 months, 136 patients received 2 months of the same chemotherapy and 133 underwent
chemoradiotherapy (54 Gy plus capecitabine).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was overall survival from the date of
the first randomization. Secondary outcomes were the effect of erlotinib and quality assurance
of radiotherapy on overall survival, progression-free survival of gemcitabine-erlotinib and
erlotinib maintenance with gemcitabine alone at the second randomization, and toxic effects.
RESULTS A total of 442 of the 449 patients (232 men; median age, 63.3 years) enrolled
underwent the first randomization. Of these, 269 underwent the second randomization.
Interim analysis was performed when 221 patients died (109 in the chemoradiotherapy group
and 112 in the chemotherapy group), reaching the early stopping boundaries for futility. With
a median follow-up of 36.7 months, the median overall survival from the date of the first
randomization was not significantly different between chemotherapy at 16.5 months
(95% CI, 14.5-18.5 months) and chemoradiotherapy at 15.2 months (95% CI, 13.9-17.3 months;
hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.79-1.34; P = .83). Median overall survival from the date of
the first randomization for the 223 patients receiving gemcitabine was 13.6 months (95% CI,
12.3-15.3 months) and was 11.9 months (95% CI, 10.4-13.5 months) for the 219 patients
receiving gemcitabine plus erlotinib (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.97-1.45; P = .09; 188 deaths vs 191
deaths). Chemoradiotherapy was associated with decreased local progression (32% vs 46%,
P = .03) and no increase in grade 3 to 4 toxicity, except for nausea.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this open-label, randomized trial involving patients with
locally advanced pancreatic cancer with disease controlled after 4 months of induction
chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in overall survival with chemoradiotherapy
compared with chemotherapy alone and there was no significant difference in overall survival
with gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine plus erlotinib used as maintenance therapy.

P
ancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-
related mortality in the Western world.1,2 Since 1997,
gemcitabine therapy has been the standard treatment
for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.3 Thereafter,
studies involving gemcitabine in combination with erlotinib
found a statistically significant but not clinically meaningful
gain of survival.4 Recently, the fluorouracil-irinotecan-
oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) combination and nab-paclitaxel-
gemcitabine combination have been shown to be superior to
gemcitabine alone in that setting.5,6
At the time of diagnosis, 30% of patients have locally ad-
vanced pancreatic cancer,2 which is defined as surgically un-
resectable, ie, with superior mesenteric artery or celiac axis
encasement of more than 180°, unreconstructable superior
mesenteric vein or portal vein occlusion, and aortic or nodal
involvement beyond the field of resection but no evidence of
distant metastases (stage T4).7 Patients with locally advanced
pancreatic cancer have an intermediate prognosis between
thosewithresectableandmetastatictumorswithmedianover-
all survival of 9 to 11 months.2
The role of radiation therapy in the management of lo-
cally advanced pancreatic cancer remains controversial. In the
early 1980s, fluorouracil-based concomitant chemoradio-
therapy was shown to be better than radiotherapy alone.8 In
the late 1990s, gemcitabine was adopted as the preferred treat-
ment strategy, replacing chemoradiotherapy, in patients
with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The results of 5 ran-
domized trials of locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients
comparing chemoradiotherapy with chemotherapy were
contradictory.9-13 Some retrospective studies have suggested
that induction chemotherapy administered before concur-
rent chemoradiotherapy could improve survival.14,15 Such a
therapeutic strategy may spare patients with rapidly progres-
sive disease from potentially toxic radiotherapy and help to
select those who could potentially benefit from chemoradio-
therapy.
The LAP07 international phase 3 trial was designed to as-
sess whether chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally ad-
vanced pancreatic cancer controlled after 4 months of gem-
citabine-based induction chemotherapy may improve survival
compared with chemotherapy alone.
Methods
Patients
Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age; had histologi-
cally or cytologically confirmed stage III locally advanced
pancreatic cancer according to the International Union
Against Cancer staging system16; had measurable or evalu-
able disease as assessed according to the Response Evalua-
tion Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0) criteria, the World
Health Organization (WHO) performance status score of 2 or
less (0 indicates fully active, 1 indicates ability only to carry
out light work, and 2 indicates capacity for self-care but
inability to carry out work); had adequate biological hema-
tologic, hepatic, and renal parameters; and had no prior
chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
Study Design and Oversight
The LAP07 trial was an international, multicenter, open-
label, unblinded, randomized phase 3 study. Patients with
locally advanced pancreatic cancer were randomized in a
1:1 ratio using a minimization procedure with stratification ac-
cording to center and performance status (0-1 vs 2) at the study
coordination center at the GERCOR (Groupe Coopérateur Mul-
tidiciplinaire en Oncologie) in Paris, France. Randomization
consisted of a 2-step randomization process (eFigure A in
Supplement 1). In the first step, patients were randomized to
inductionchemotherapywithgemcitabineorgemcitabineplus
erlotinib for 4 cycles. For the second step, patients whose tu-
mor was controlled (ie, stable or with an objective response)
and who had a WHO performance status of 2 or less after
completionofinductionchemotherapywererandomizedasec-
ond time to receive either chemotherapy or chemoradio-
therapy for an additional 2 months. Maintenance therapy with
erlotinib was given to patients who were without disease pro-
gression, who had a WHO performance status of 2 or less,
and who were allocated to receive gemcitabine plus erlotinib
or had experienced limiting toxic effects during the first-
randomization period.
The primary objective was to assess whether administra-
tion of chemoradiotherapy to patients whose tumor was con-
trolled after 4 months of induction chemotherapy increases
overall survival from the date of the first randomization com-
pared with continuing the same chemotherapy.
Secondary objectives were progression-free survival from
the date of the first randomization, overall survival from the
date of the first randomization, progression-free survival
from the date of the first randomization of the erlotinib-
gemcitabine combination and erlotinib maintenance therapy
vs gemcitabine alone, tolerance of erlotinib maintenance af-
ter the end of chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, and the
effect of radiation therapy quality assurance on overall sur-
vival from the date of the first randomization.
For preplanned sensitivity analyses, overall survival and
progression-free survival from the date of the second random-
ization of patients achieving the second randomization were
calculated.
In addition, an ancillary study about prognostic markers
on histology and circulating tumor cells was planned and are
reported elsewhere.17

dinationwerecarriedoutbytheGERCORgroup.Thestudypro-
tocolwasapprovedbytheindependentethicscommitteeofeach

ethical principles contained in the Declaration of Helsinki (see
the study protocol in Supplement 2). All the patients signed an
informed consent before entering the study. All the investiga-
tors vouched for the adherence to the study protocol.
Treatment
Gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 was delivered as a 30-
minute intravenous infusion weekly for 3 weeks, followed by
a 1-week rest (1 cycle), for 4 cycles. Erlotinib was given once-
dailyorallyatadoseof100mg.Duringthemaintenancephase,
the daily dose of erlotinib was increased to 150 mg.

Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy
Patients underwent contrast-enhanced planning computed
tomography simulation. Gross tumor volume included the
gross primary tumor and any lymph node with short axis
diameter of 1 cm or more. The planning target volume
encompassed the gross tumor volume with a margin of 3 cm
in the superior-inferior direction and 1.5 cm in all other
directions to account for the set-up uncertainties and
respiratory-induced organ motions.18 Prophylactic irradia-
tion of uninvolved regional nodes was not performed. The
total planned dose to the planning target volume was 54 Gy
in 30 daily fractions over 6 weeks. Concurrent capecitabine
was given at a dose of 800 mg/m2 twice daily on days of
radiation therapy.
Radiation Therapy Quality Assurance and Quality Control
The mandated radiation therapy quality assurance consisted
of detailed radiation therapy guidelines developed by an in-
ternational board.18 The radiation therapy quality assurance
program included a pretrial test case (benchmark case).19 All
centers were classified in 3 categories according to the radia-
tion therapy quality assurance: per protocol, minor devia-
tion, or major deviation. Those with major deviation were not
allowedtoincludepatientsuntilasignificantimprovementwas
achieved and the guidelines were rigorously followed. On-
trial radiotherapy quality control consisted of a central re-
view and dose-volume histograms for each patient was per-
formed by 2 experts in treatment planning. Centers received
a real-time quality control feedback in order to improve the
quality of radiotherapy treatment.
Assessments
Tumor outcome was evaluated every 8 weeks by spiral com-
puted tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Se-
rumcarbohydrateantigen19-9(CA19-9)wasmeasuredatbase-
line and every 8 weeks thereafter. Safety was monitored for
treatment-relatedadverseeventsandforseriousadverseevents
before each cycle of chemotherapy. Treatment-related ad-
verse events were graded according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
version 3.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment
/electronic_applications/docs/ctcaev3.pdf). Patients were
followed up for survival until death or study closure.
For primary objectives and analyses of time to event end
points, overall survival was defined as the time from the date
of the first randomization to the date of death from any cause.
Patients who were still alive at the date cutoff were censored.
Progression-freesurvivalwasdefinedasthetimefromthedate
of the first randomization to the date of tumor progression or
death. Patients who were alive without progression at the date
cutoff were censored.
For preplanned sensitivity analyses of time to event end
points among patients achieving the second randomization:
overall survival was defined as the time from the date of the
second randomization to the date of death from any cause. Pa-
tients who were still alive at the date cutoff were censored.
Tumor control was defined as complete response, partial
response, or stable disease.
Statistical Analyses
The trial was designed to detect an increase in median overall
survival from the date of the first randomization from 9 to 12
months in the chemoradiotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR],
0.75) with a 2-sided type I error of 5% and a statistical power
of 80%.14 With a uniform accrual of 20 patients per month over
24 months, 480 patients were needed with an anticipated 15
months of follow-up after the second randomization to ob-
serve the 392 required deaths. The anticipated trial duration
was 39 months. With an estimated 30% of patients who had
progressive disease and therefore ineligible for the second ran-
domization, we targeted a total sample size of 722 patients (in-
cluding 5% of patients lost to follow-up).

and a P value ≤.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Efficacy and safety assessments were conducted in the
intent-to-treat(ITT)population.Twopopulationdatasetswere
constructed according to patient randomization profile.
The first-randomization ITT population was defined as all
patients randomized between gemcitabine and gemcitabine
plus erlotinib irrespective of eligibility criteria, treatment re-
ceived, and the second randomization taking place. This popu-
lationwasusedforanalysisofthesecondobjectiveofthestudy,
which compared gemcitabine to gemcitabine plus erlotinib
(first randomization).
The second-randomization ITT population, defined as all
patients who were free of progression and who had a WHO per-
formance status of 2 or less at 4 months, were randomized to
receive either chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy irrespec-
tive of eligibility criteria and treatment received. This popu-
lation was used for analysis of the primary objective compar-
ing overall survival according to chemoradiotherapy vs
chemotherapy (second randomization) and for secondary ob-
jectives for the second-randomization patients. Missing data
for covariables were not imputed.
Preplanned sensitivity analysis comparing overall sur-
vival according to chemoradiotherapy vs chemotherapy
(second randomization) in the second ITT population was cal-
culated from the date of the second randomization.

Bivariable Cox proportional-hazards model was used to esti-

specific random effects on the hazard function of the Cox pro-
portional hazards was used to account for the fact that patients
were clustered within centers and the reintroduction policy
could vary between centers.21
Interactionbetweentreatmentallocationafterthefirstand
second randomization was initially tested before performing
survivalanalyses.Additionally,survivalanalysesfromthedate

tion who received chemoradiotherapy at the second random-
ization. The reverse Kaplan-Meier method, defined as the time
interval between the origin and last follow-up using Kaplan-
Meier estimation for patients alive as the event and deaths as
censored observations, was used to estimate follow-up.22
Analyses of adverse events were conducted and descrip-
tive statistics were provided. In addition, the time to occur-
rence of grade 3 and 4 toxicities, regardless of their type, was
assessedusingaCoxproportional-hazardsmodel(aftergraphi-
cal check of proportionality). Analyses were conducted with
the use of SAS statistical software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute
Inc), and R (version 3.1.2).
Results
Patients
Between February 2008 and December 2011, a total of 449 pa-
tients from 80 centers in France, Australia, New Zealand,
Belgium, and Sweden were enrolled. Of these, 4 patients had
missing data, 2 had a periampullary cancer, and 1 had a history
of other previous malignancy that has been in complete remis-
sion for less than 5 years, thus leaving 442 eligible patients. A
total of 442 patients underwent the first randomization, with
gemcitabine administered in 223 (50%) patients and gem-
citabinepluserlotinibgivenin219(50%)patientsinthefirstITT
population (Figure 1). Demographics and baseline characteris-
tics were well balanced between the 2 groups (Table 1).
Among the 442 eligible patients who participated in the
first randomization, 269 (61%) underwent the second random-
ization after 4 months, including 136 randomized to receive
chemotherapy and 133 randomized to receive chemoradio-
therapy (second ITT population). One hundred seventy-
three patients (39%) were not randomized, mostly due to tu-
morprogression(102patients[23.1%];Figure1).Medianoverall
follow-up time was 36.7 months (95% CI, 27.6-44.2 months).
Efficacy
Complete survival data were collected until the databases lock
on February 22, 2013. The median follow-up was 34.3 months
(95% CI, 27.6-43.8 months) for the first ITT population. Three
hundredseventy-ninepatientsdiedbytheendofthefollow-up.
Overall, median overall survival was 12.8 months (95% CI,
11.8-14.1 months). The ITT analysis according to the first-
randomization status showed no significant difference in over-
all survival between patients receiving gemcitabine alone
(n = 223) or gemcitabine plus erlotinib (n = 219), with median
overall survival of 13.6 months (95% CI, 12.3-15.3 months) and

the 173 patients who did not reach the second randomization,
the median overall survival from the date of the first random-

lar results were obtained with post hoc analysis using a frailty
approach to take into account the center potential effect in
the Cox model (P = .89). There was no statistically significant
difference in progression-free survival from the date of the
first randomization between chemotherapy group (median,
8.4 months; 95% CI, 7.8-9.4 months) and the chemoradio-
therapy group (median, 9.9 months; 95% CI, 8.8-10.4 months;
HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-1.01; P = .06; Figure 3B)
In the group of patients who received gemcitabine plus
erlotinib and achieved the second randomization, patients
with erlotinib maintenance therapy had a lower overall sur-
vival from the date of the first randomization compared with
those receiving gemcitabine; 14.5 months (95% CI, 13.2-16.1)
vs 17.1 (95% CI, 15.3-19.0; HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.01-1.72; P = .04).
Median overall survival from the date of the second random-
ization was 10.8 months (95% CI, 9.33-12.65 months) with
erlotinib and 13.44 months (95% CI, 11.60-15.18 months) with
erlotinib plus gemcitabine.

12 (9%) did not receive chemoradiotherapy. One hundred sev-
enteen patients (88%) were assessable for radiation therapy
quality analysis. Among these patients, 37 (32%) had radia-
tion per protocol, with minor deviation in 59 (50%) or major
deviation in 21 (18%). Protocol violations were mainly due to
the dose distribution heterogeneities. Deviations from the
planned schedule did not significantly influence overall sur-
vival from the date of the first and the second randomization.

minordeviationsvs10.1months(95%CI,5.8-12.3months)with
major deviations (P = .19).
Adverse Events
Tables 2 summarizes grade 3 or 4 toxicities observed during
the first and second phase of treatment.
During the induction chemotherapy (first randomiza-
tion),patientstreatedwithgemcitabinepluserlotinibhadmore
grade 3 or 4 anemia (P = .05), febrile neutropenia (P = .03), di-
arrhea (P = .006), and acneiform rash (P = .007) than those
treated with gemcitabine alone.
Except for the 6 patients (5.9%) in the chemoradio-
therapy group who had grade 3 or 4 nausea vs none in the che-
motherapy group (P = .008), the adverse toxic effects during
the second randomization were not different between the
2 groups.
Progression
Of all the study patients, 385 (87%) had tumor progression. For
130 patients (34%), it was locoregional; 207 (54%), meta-
static; 48 (12%) unknown type.
Among the 269 patients who underwent the second ran-
domization, 236 patients (88%) had tumor progression, which
was locoregional in 93 patients (39%), metastatic in 122 pa-
tients (52%), and of unknown type in 21 patients (9%). Locore-
gional progression was less frequent in the chemoradio-
therapy group (35 [32%]) than in the chemotherapy group (58
[46%]), whereas metastatic progression was more common in
the chemoradiotherapy group (67 [60%]) than in the chemo-
therapy group (55 [44%]; P = .04).
Time Without Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy After
Protocol Completion
Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both were reintroduced in 190
patients (42.9%) after protocol completion. The median de-
lay to treatment reintroduction was 6.1 months (95% CI, 4.8-
7.0 months) for the chemoradiotherapy group, significantly
longer than the 3.7 months (95% CI, 3.0-4.6) for the chemo-
therapy group (P = .02). Second lines of chemotherapies were
used, mainly flurouracil/platinum salt-based, but the rate was
well-balanced across the 2 groups.
Surgery
Eighteen patients (4%) underwent a curative-intent resec-
tion, 6 before the second randomization (these were excluded
from the study) and 12 after the completion of protocol (8 [6%]
afterchemotherapyand4[3%]afterchemoradiotherapy,P = .25
for Fisher exact test). Eleven patients (2.5%) had an R0 resec-
tion, 2 (0.5%) had an R1 resection, and 5 (1.1%) had unknown
marginsstatus.Medianoverallsurvivalfromthedateofthefirst
randomization for these 18 patients was 30.9 months (95% CI,
12.3-NA).
Discussion
This open-label, randomized clinical trial showed no survival
benefit of chemoradiotherapy compared with chemotherapy
in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer con-
trolled after 4 months of induction chemotherapy, with me-
dian overall survival from the date of the first randomization
of 15.2 months and 16.5 months, respectively.
The lack of superiority of chemoradiotherapy cannot be
explained by insufficient power of the study. The trial was
stoppedaftertheindependentdatamonitoringcommitteecon-
cluded that the planned intermediate analysis could be the fi-
nal one to answer the primary objective of the study. Quality
of radiation therapy could be questioned because deviations
from the protocol can impact negatively on the outcome of pa-
tients receiving chemoradiotherapy.23
However,thisstudyincludedbotharadiationtherapyqual-
ity assurance program and quality control to ensure that the
protocol was well understood and that the modalities of ra-
diation therapy were followed. Although deviations from the
planned protocol occurred after the second randomization
(minor 50%, major 18%), these did not affect significantly the
overall survival duration of patients who received chemora-
diotherapy. Moreover, the tolerance of chemoradiotherapy in
this study was similar to that of chemotherapy except for nau-
sea; therefore, the lack of superiority of chemoradiotherapy
cannot be explained by excessive treatment toxicity in the che-
moradiotherapygroupasitwassuggestedinapreviousstudy.12
In patients attending the second randomization, the final
overall survival rates from the date of the first randomization
werehigher(15.2and16.5months)thanthosewehypothesized
(9 and 12 months). In 2 other prospective studies, overall sur-
vivalswere13and11.1months.12,13Itislikelythatinductionche-
motherapywasselectedforpatientswithamorefavorableprog-
nosis. Indeed, patients who were excluded before the second
randomization had a median survival of 7.7 months.
The SCALOP phase 2 randomized trial,24 a study with a
similar design to ours, showed overall survival of 15.2 months
for capecitabine plus radiotherapy and 13.4 months for gem-
citabine plus radiotherapy. Increased use of subsequent che-
motherapy lines and improvement of supportive care likely
contributed to the survival improvement. Although in the
LAP07 trial chemoradiotherapy did not increase overall sur-
vival compared with chemotherapy, increase in progression-
free survival resulted in a longer period without treatment (6.1
vs 3.7 months, P = .02) and less frequent locoregional tumor
progressions (32% vs 46%, P = .04), the latter confirming the
efficacyofchemoradiationforlocalcontrol.Whetherthiscould
translate to a major benefit in terms of quality of life remains
uncertain.Alossoftumorcontrolthatcouldhaveoccurreddur-
ing the period without treatment could be questioned. How-
ever, patients of both groups were evaluated equally every 2
months, and a treatment was initiated in all patients as soon
as a progressive disease was observed.
The LAP07 trial was designed to assess the effect of the
gemcitabine-erlotinib combination based on the results from

the addition of erlotinib to gemcitabine, despite excellent ad-
herence (92%), failed to improve survival and yet was associ-
ated with increased grade 3 hematologic, digestive, and skin
toxicities. Whether the results of this study could have impli-
cations for trials addressing erlotinib or chemoradiotherapy in
the adjuvant setting, ie, RTOG 0848, cannot be addressed by
our trial, which focused only on the locally advanced pancre-
atic cancer question.

This suggests that in patients with locally advanced pan-
creatic cancer, more efficient systemic treatments are needed
to treat any early micrometastatic spread and to downstage tu-
mors. FOLFIRINOX or nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine regimens
may address better these issues and allow consideration of
other locoregional treatments, eg, secondary surgical resec-
tion or more optimized chemoradiation.5,6,25,26
The LAP07 study has several limitations. First, nonopti-
mal drugs were used for chemotherapy because the study was
designed in 2005, before the advent of FOLFIRINOX and nab-
paclitaxel. In addition, despite the protocol suggested FOLFOX
administration as a second-line treatment, subsequent lines of
chemotherapy were not systematized. Quality-of-life and cost-
efficacyanalyseswerenotplannedassecondaryobjectives,as-
sessment of pain was not optimal, and the evaluation of tumor
response and progress-free survival was not centralized.
Although LAP07 confirmed the safety of radiation therapy
with concurrent capecitabine, a further intensification of the
chemoradiotherapy regimen seems to be needed. Intensity-
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body ra-
diation therapy are highly conformal modes of radiation de-
livery that allow for improved sparing of nearby normal
structures while increasing the dose to the target volume. A
phase 1 and 2 study has shown the feasibility of dose escala-
tion from 50 to 60 Gy with IMRT and concurrent gemcitabine
with promising results.27
The low secondary surgical resection rate of 4% in the
LAP07 study confirms that gemcitabine alone or in combina-
tion with erlotinib does not provide a significant downstag-
ing of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. A higher rate of re-
section (33.2%) has been reported in a meta-analysis by Gillen
et al,28 but most series analyzed in this report were small-
sized and heterogeneous regarding the distinction between
borderlineandlocallyadvancedtumorsandthetreatmentsap-
plied. Our study suggests that tumors were properly diag-
nosed as locally advanced pancreatic cancer and that second-
ary resection is rarely possible.
An ancillary study of LAP07 showed that evaluation of mi-
crometastatic disease using circulating tumor cells detection
was a promising prognostic tool in patients with locally ad-
vanced pancreatic cancer.17
Conclusions
In this open label, randomized trial among patients with lo-
cally advanced pancreatic cancer with disease controlled after
4 months of induction chemotherapy, there was no significant
difference in overall survival with chemoradiotherapy com-
pared with chemotherapy alone, and there was no significant
difference in overall survival with gemcitabine compared with
gemcitabine plus erlotinib used as maintenance therapy.
