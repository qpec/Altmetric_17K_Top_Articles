IMPORTANCE Intensive follow-up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer is
common in clinical practice, but evidence of a survival benefit is limited.
OBJECTIVE To examine overall mortality, colorectal cancer–specific mortality, and colorectal
cancer–specific recurrence rates among patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer who
were randomized after curative surgery to 2 alternative schedules for follow-up testing with
computed tomography and carcinoembryonic antigen.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Unblinded randomized trial including 2509 patients
with stage II or III colorectal cancer treated at 24 centers in Sweden, Denmark, and Uruguay
from January 2006 through December 2010 and followed up for 5 years; follow-up ended on
December 31, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized either to follow-up testing with computed
tomography of the thorax and abdomen and serum carcinoembryonic antigen at 6, 12, 18, 24,
and 36 months after surgery (high-frequency group; n = 1253 patients) or at 12 and 36
months after surgery (low-frequency group; n = 1256 patients).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were 5-year overall mortality and
colorectal cancer–specific mortality rates. The secondary outcome was the colorectal
cancer–specific recurrence rate. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses
were performed.
RESULTS Among 2555 patients who were randomized, 2509 were included in the
intention-to-treat analysis (mean age, 63.5 years; 1128 women [45%]) and 2365 (94.3%)
completed the trial. The 5-year overall patient mortality rate in the high-frequency group was
13.0% (161/1253) compared with 14.1% (174/1256) in the low-frequency group (risk difference,
1.1% [95% CI, −1.6% to 3.8%]; P = .43). The 5-year colorectal cancer–specific mortality rate in
the high-frequency group was 10.6% (128/1248) compared with 11.4% (137/1250) in the
low-frequency group (risk difference, 0.8% [95% CI, −1.7% to 3.3%]; P = .52). The colorectal
cancer–specific recurrence rate was 21.6% (265/1248) in the high-frequency group compared
with 19.4% (238/1250) in the low-frequency group (risk difference, 2.2% [95% CI, −1.0% to
5.4%]; P = .15).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer, follow-up
testing with computed tomography and carcinoembryonic antigen more frequently
compared with less frequently did not result in a significant rate reduction in 5-year overall
mortality or colorectal cancer–specific mortality.

 A
cross very high human deprivation index countries,
0.7 million new cases of colorectal cancer are diag-
nosed annually.1 Two-thirds of these patients present
at tumor stage II or III,2 and the majority of whom undergo cu-
rative resection and are eligible for subsequent surveillance
screening. In most countries, patients undergo follow-up
examinations to detect cancer recurrence. However, the ques-
tion of appropriate follow-up intervals has been controver-
sial, and varying intensity of follow-up has been used within
and among countries.3,4 The reasons for patient follow-up
after colorectal surgery with curative intent include (1) to de-
tect recurrence and adverse effects when curative treat-
ment is still possible, thus improving survival; (2) to assess the
quality of the primary treatment; (3) to detect metachronous
tumors; and (4) to satisfy a patient’
s desire for information
about prognosis.5
From 2005 to the present, approaches for treating recur-
rence, including resection of liver and lung metastases and im-
proved adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy,6 have im-
proved patient outcomes. The availability of better treatment
formetastaticdiseasepromptedevaluationofthesurvivalben-
efitwithmore-intensivevsless-intensivesurveillanceafterpri-
mary surgery. However, systematic reviews and a random-
ized trial provided inconclusive evidence regarding survival
benefit.7-13 This lack of consistency highlights the need for a
large contemporary trial to evaluate any survival benefit as-
sociated with more intense follow-up.
Given the advances in treatment options, we sought to de-
termine whether intensive frequency of surveillance tests pro-
vides a survival benefit after curative resection among pa-
tients with stage II or III colorectal cancer (COLOFOL trial).
Specifically,thisrandomizedtrialwasdesignedtocomparesur-
veillance with a more intensive vs a less intensive schedule of
follow-up testing with computed tomography (CT) and se-
rum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The hypothesis was that
more intense follow-up testing with CT and CEA and a focus
on potentially treatable recurrences (eg, lung and liver metas-
tases) would decrease 5-year overall and colorectal cancer–
specific mortality rates and extend time to colorectal cancer–
specific recurrence.
Methods
Trial Design and Study Setting
The COLOFOL study group was established in 2004 and in-
vited centers in Denmark, Sweden, Ireland, Poland, Hungary,
England, the Netherlands, and Uruguay to participate in
recruitment.5 To take part in the study, each center was sup-
posed to enroll at least 50 patients within 2 years and at least
30% of its eligible patients. These criteria were modified by the
steering committee in 2007 after study initiation because
smaller centers could not achieve the 50-patient threshold;
therefore, the minimum inclusion was reduced to 20 pa-
tients within 2 years.5
The recruitment centers in Hungary, England, and the
Netherlands were never established (mainly due to conflict-
ing national clinical guidelines) and 5 centers in Poland and
Ireland did not meet the minimum threshold and were ex-
cluded.Twenty-fourrecruitmentcentersinDenmark,Sweden,
and Uruguay remained in the study. The study was approved
by ethics committees in each of the participating countries.
The study protocol and statistical analysis plan appear in
Supplement 1.
Participants
Inclusion criteria were surgical resection with curative intent
forcolorectaladenocarcinoma(withorwithoutadjuvanttreat-
ment), age of 75 years or younger, provision of written in-
formed consent for participation, a colon and rectum free of
neoplasia verified by perioperative barium enema or a colo-
noscopy within 3 months after surgery, and tumor stage II
or III (T3-T4, N0, M0, any N1-N2, M0).
Exclusion criteria were a clinical diagnosis of hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial adenomatous pol-
yposis, local resection of colorectal cancer (eg, transanal en-
doscopic microsurgery procedure), life expectancy of less than
2 years due to comorbid conditions (eg, cardiac disease, ad-
vanced multiple sclerosis with systemic complications, or liver
cirrhosis), inability or refusal to provide informed consent, in-
ability to comply with study requirements, inability to toler-
ate surgery for recurrence, other or previous malignancies
(except for nonmelanoma skin cancer), or participation in an-
other clinical trial that was incompatible with this study’
s
follow-up regimen.
Participants were required to have at least 1 imaging pro-
cedure (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or CT)
of the liver and CT or radiography of the lungs prior to sur-
gery. Patients also were required to have testing with CEA at 1
month after surgery. Patients with an elevated CEA level were
enrolled only after a completely negative diagnostic workup.
Written informed consent for participation was obtained at
least 30 days after surgical resection of the primary colorectal
cancer.
Intervention
Patients randomized to the high-frequency group were re-
quired to have follow-up testing with multislice contrast-
enhanced CT of the thorax and abdomen and CEA at 6, 12, 18,
24, and 36 months after surgery. Patients randomized to the
low-frequency group were required to have follow-up testing
Key Points
Question Is intensive follow-up of patients after curative surgery
for colorectal cancer effective in reducing mortality?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 2509
patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer, follow-up testing with
computed tomography and serum carcinoembryonic antigen on 5
vs 2 occasions did not result in a significant difference in the 5-year
overall mortality rate (13.0% vs 14.1%, respectively) or colorectal
cancer–specific mortality rate (10.6% vs 11.4%).
Meaning Among patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer,
increased frequency of follow-up testing did not reduce the 5-year
mortality rate.

 with multislice contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax and ab-
domenandCEAat12and36monthsaftersurgery.Testingwith
a pelvic CT was not required. Participating patients were ran-
domized in block sizes of 10 by computer allocation to 1 of the
2 follow-up regimens.
Endoscopy and examination for pelvic recurrence were al-
lowed in both groups at the discretion of the treating physi-
cian. Although permitted in the study, no department used
magnetic resonance imaging or chest radiography as part of
its surveillance program. An external consultant (Lennart
Blomquist,PhD,KarolinskaHospital,Stockholm,Sweden)with
extensive experience in abdominal CT certified the quality of
the CT scans at each recruitment center (Supplement 1).
After verification of study enrollment criteria, baseline in-
formation for each participant (sex, comorbidity, and life-
style factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, pre-
operative diagnosis and staging, type of surgery performed,
pathological staging after surgery, postoperative complica-
tions, blood transfusions, and adjuvant chemotherapy or ra-
diation therapy) was recorded. At each follow-up surveil-
lanceexamination,datawerecollectedonsymptoms,CTscans,
and CEA test results per the trial protocol, and additional ex-
aminations were performed for suspected recurrence. In ac-
cordancewiththestudy’
spragmaticapproach,upto3months’
variability in follow-up intervals was allowed to accommo-
date local needs for prioritization and patient preferences.
Symptoms leading to interval examinations also were re-
corded. If a recurrence was not detected during an interval
follow-up examination, the patient was allowed to continue
inthestudy.Ifarecurrencewassuspectedduringanyfollow-up
examination, the case was discussed at a meeting of the local
multidisciplinary team and further diagnostic assessment (eg,
positron emission tomography or CT) and treatment was un-
dertaken as recommended (eg, surgery for liver or other me-
tastases,referralforchemotherapyorradiationtherapy,orboth
surgery and therapy).
Each center had to follow-up all study participants with
surveillance examinations until 3 years after surgery accord-
ing to the protocol and to report outcomes to the study’
s co-
ordinating center until 5 years after surgery. Clinically diag-
nosed recurrences and deaths were reported at the time of the
event.Allpatientsweretrackedthroughoutthestudybymoni-
toring their inpatient and outpatient records and through link-
age with national population and cancer registries (except in
Uruguay because only hospital data were available).14,15
Patients known to have emigrated or whose medical rec-
ordswerediscontinuedweredeemedlosttofollow-upandcen-
sored on the date of their last identifiable data point. Follow-up
ended on December 31, 2015. All data were submitted elec-
tronically from the recruitment centers to the study’
s coordi-
nating center in Denmark.
Outcomes
Theprimaryoutcomeswere5-yearoverallmortalityand5-year
colorectal cancer–specific mortality rates. The secondary out-
come was the colorectal cancer–specific recurrence rate dur-
ing 5 years of follow-up. Potential adverse events were not sys-
tematically tracked.
Statistical Analysis
Sample Size Calculation
At the time the study was designed, the results of 2 meta-
analyses7,8 pointed out an effect in favor of high-intensity
follow-up. One of these meta-analyses additionally reported
the range of absolute reduction in mortality rate from 9% to
13%.7 Given the uncertainty in the evidence, and the inclu-
sion of a surveillance intervention in the comparator group
(whereas some older trials had no surveillance intervention in
the comparator group), the study was designed to detect an
absolute difference in mortality rate of 6% between the low-
intensity and high-intensity surveillance groups.
Assuming a 5% risk of type I error and a 15% risk of type II
error, 1083 patients needed to be randomized to each group.
Given an expected dropout rate of 20%, the planned number
of randomized patients was 2500.
Main Statistical Analysis
Participants were characterized by randomization group
and by sex, age, clinical variables, comorbidities, and the
lifestyle factors of smoking and alcohol consumption. Pri-
mary and secondary outcomes data were analyzed using the
Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was used for
between-group comparisons. In the time-to-recurrence
analysis, patients were censored at the time of death. In the
intention-to-treat analyses, trial participants were followed
up from the date of radical surgery for colorectal cancer
until the analyzed study outcome, date of dropout, date
when lost to follow-up, or at 5-year follow-up, whichever
came first.
In addition, risk differences in the 5-year mortality rate
and in the recurrence probabilities were calculated with 95%
CIs. The cumulative incidence curves were computed using
Kaplan-Meier estimates minus 1. Study results were evalu-
ated on an intention-to-treat basis and on an as-treated per-
protocol basis. There were missing data for some key vari-
ables for 11 patients (5 in the high-frequency group and 6 in
the low-frequency group). Patients who withdrew informed
consent or switched to another follow-up regimen remained
in their randomized group for the intention-to-treat analysis,
but were excluded from the per-protocol analysis.
Post Hoc Subgroup Analysis
Post hoc analyses were stratified by cancer stage (stage II or
III) and were repeated for patients with rectal cancer who had
or did not have preoperative radiotherapy. Moreover, a poten-
tial statistical cancer stage × frequency of follow-up testing in-
teraction was assessed by inclusion of these interaction terms
in a Cox regression model.
Post Hoc Sensitivity Analysis
To test the robustness of the risk estimates, 3 additional
sensitivity analyses were performed. First, Cox proportional
hazard regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs)
with 95% CIs for overall mortality rate, colorectal cancer–
specific mortality rate, and colorectal cancer–specific recur-
rence rate. The analysis was adjusted for age at colorectal
cancer surgery, sex, colorectal cancer type, cancer stage,

 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, cere-
brovascular disease, preoperative radiation, adjuvant che-
motherapy, and smoking.
Second, the main analysis was repeated for the pri-
mary and secondary outcomes and compared the outcomes
among the 3 participating countries of Denmark, Sweden,
and Uruguay.
Third, a frailty model analysis was performed for the
primary and secondary outcomes by introducing ran-
dom effects in the model to account for associations and
unobserved heterogeneity due to participation of dif-
ferent centers.16
The level of significance was P < .05 with a 2-sided test.
The Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple
comparisons in the post hoc subgroup analysis.17 Each indi-
vidual hypothesis was tested at a significance level of α di-
vided by n, where α was the critical P value level for signifi-
canceandnwasthenumberofdifferenttests.Insteadofsetting
the critical P level for significance at .05, a new significance
level of .02 (P = .05/3) was defined given the 3 end points. The
statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Of the 13 718 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal
cancer between January 2006 and December 2010 at par-
ticipating recruitment centers, 2555 were randomized,
and 2509 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.
The number of participants assessed for eligibility and
the reasons for exclusion appear in Figure 1. There were
1253 patients in the high-frequency group and 1256 patients
in the low-frequency group who were included in the
intention-to-treat analysis.
The demographic characteristics of the patients and the
clinical risk factors appear in the Table. The 2 groups were well
balanced, with no major differences observed between pa-
tients in the high-frequency and low-frequency groups. Pa-
tients in the high-frequency group should have had CT on 5
occasions and the median number was 5 (mean, 4.3); pa-
tients in the low-frequency group should have had CT on 2 oc-
casions and the median number was 2 (mean, 1.8).
The proportion of patients with no protocol violations
was 94.2% in the high-frequency group and 94.3% in the

lations were similar in the groups (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
The most common reason was missing follow-up visits (45 pa-
tients). Seven patients were lost to follow-up.
Primary Outcomes
Among all participants, the 5-year overall mortality rate was
13.6%. The 5-year overall mortality rate was 13.0% (95% CI,
11.3% to 15.1%; n = 161) among the 1253 patients in the high-
frequency group vs 14.1% (95% CI, 12.3% to 16.2%; n = 174)
among the 1256 patients in the low-frequency group in the in-
tention-to-treat analysis (risk difference, 1.1% [95% CI, −1.6%
to 3.8%]; P = .43). Cumulative incidence plots appear in
Figure 2. In the per-protocol analysis, the 5-year mortality rate
was 13.3% (95% CI, 11.5% to 15.4%; n = 157) among the 1180 pa-
tients in the high-frequency group vs 14.5% (95% CI, 12.6% to
16.7%; n = 172) among the 1185 patients in the low-frequency
group (risk difference, 1.2% [95% CI, −1.6% to 4.0%]; P = .39;

1179) in the low-frequency group (risk difference, 2.3% [95%
CI, −1.0% to 5.6%]; P = .15).
Post Hoc Subgroup Analysis
The analyses stratified by cancer stage yielded no significant
between-group differences (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Patients with rectal cancer constituted a special subgroup.
In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 5-year overall mor-
tality rate was 13.7% (95% CI, 10.8%-17.4%; n = 58) among the
428 patients with rectal cancer in the high-frequency group
vs 15.0% (95% CI, 12.0%-18.7%; n = 67) among the 456
patients with rectal cancer in the low-frequency group.
Among these 884 patients, 510 received preoperative radio-
therapy. There was no between-group difference in the
5-year overall mortality rate.

Post Hoc Sensitivity Analysis
Intheintention-to-treatanalysis,nosignificantassociationswith
the primary outcomes were found in a Cox regression analysis
controlling for covariates when patients in the high-intensity
group were compared with patients in the low-intensity group
for the 5-year overall mortality rate (adjusted HR, 0.90; 95% CI,
0.73-1.12) or the colorectal cancer–specific mortality rate
(adjusted HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.72-1.17). The risk of detected re-
currence was not significantly increased in the high-intensity
groupcomparedwiththelow-intensitygroup(adjustedHR,1.15
[95% CI, 0.97-1.38]; eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
No significant differences were observed in the sensitiv-
ity analysis of the 3 participating countries (eFigure in
Supplement2).Nosignificantbetween-groupdifferenceswere
found in the frailty analysis (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
In this trial of more than 2500 patients with colorectal cancer
whounderwentsurgerywithcurativeintent,nosignificantrate
differences in 5-year overall mortality or colorectal cancer–
specific mortality were found when the intensity of postop-
erative colorectal cancer follow-up was increased from 2 to 5
examinations during the 3 years after surgery and with 5 years
of follow-up. In the high-intensity group, colorectal cancer–
specific recurrence was detected earlier, but this did not trans-
late into a reduced mortality rate.
The data extend former research on the utility of postop-
erative colorectal cancer follow-up. Systematic reviews con-
ducted in 2002, 2003, and 2007 (including meta-analyses of
randomizedtrialscomparingintensivevslessintensivefollow-
up) indicated that more intense regimens were associated with
improved survival.7-10 Only use of testing with CEA and CT
of the liver demonstrated significant efficacy in detecting
recurrence.7-10 The included studies were heterogeneous and
cancer-specific survival data were not statistically signifi-
cant. Furthermore, the survival benefit might not have been
relatedtoearlierdetectionandtreatmentofrecurrentdisease.18
In addition, most studies were conducted during the era
before the availability of advanced imaging techniques, mul-
timodal treatment of metastatic disease, or both, which is re-
flected by a very high local recurrence rate and a high propor-
tion of detected metachronous primary tumors.
The data correspond with the Follow-up After Colorectal
Surgery (FACS) trial and a 2016 meta-analysis.11-13 The FACS
trial included 1202 patients who had undergone curative
treatment for Duke colorectal cancer stages A to C in 39 hos-
pitals in the United Kingdom. The patients were allocated to 1
of 4 study regimens: minimum follow-up, CEA testing only,
CT only, or CEA testing plus CT. Serum CEA level was mea-
sured every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for
3 years. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and
pelvis was done every 6 months for 2 years and then annu-
ally for 3 years. Those in the minimum follow-up and CEA
testing only groups had a CT only once during 12 to 18
months of follow-up. Mortality during follow-up was 18.2%
in the combined intensive follow-up groups compared with
15.9% in the combined minimum follow-up groups. The
authors13 concluded that (1) the survival advantage of any
intervention was small and (2) the trial lacked sufficient

 power to assess whether improved detection of treatable
recurrences achieved by intensive follow-up leads to a re-
duced overall mortality rate.
Likewise, the 2016 review did not suggest any overall
survival benefit from intensifying patient follow-up after
curative surgery for colorectal cancer.11 This updated review
included 5403 participants enrolled in 15 earlier studies and
in 2 new studies. The review concluded that more partici-
pants were treated with salvage surgery with curative intent
in the intensive follow-up group, but this was not associated
with improved survival. Harms related to intensive follow-up
and salvage therapy were not well reported.
Survival was higher than expected in both the present
trial and in the FACS trial.12 The differences in survival might
reflect the lower proportion of emergency procedures in
the present study and the better outcomes expected for
patients recruited to a randomized trial compared with pa-
tients receiving routine clinical care.19 Another likely expla-
nation is that the design of the study, which required (based
on FASC results12) a colon and rectum free of neoplasia and
a meticulous preoperative workup excluding synchronous
metastases, reduced the rate of residual cancer disease
at study entry. Furthermore, survival improved during the
study period in the general population with colorectal can-
cer in both Sweden and Denmark,20-22 probably due to im-
proved adjuvant treatment and centralized surgery. Based on
national cancer registry data, corresponding survival figures
for the same period and using the same inclusion criteria
were 86.4% in Denmark and 85.0% in Sweden. This also may
explain the discrepancy in this trial’
s findings compared with
those of the meta-analyses.7-10 In the studies included in the
meta-analyses, residual disease rather than recurrence could
have been detected during follow-up. This is consistent with
an analysis of randomized patients vs eligible patients in the
present study, which showed no difference in distribution of
age and sex.
However, more patients with colon cancer were random-
ized compared with nonparticipating eligible patients (56% vs
51%, respectively) and had stage II cancer (56% vs 49%).5 It is
also unlikely that more aggressive tumor biology had an ef-
fect. In the subgroup analyses based on cancer stage, no im-
provedefficacyofhigh-intensityfollow-upamongpatientswith
stage III disease vs patients with stage II disease or any differ-
ence due to tumor site (ie, colon or rectum) were detected.
Progress in the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal can-
cer has intensified the discussion of how and when to
follow-up patients after resection with curative intent. Test-
ing of CEA levels, which has long been considered to be cen-
tral to surveillance,4 was questioned in a study based on
20-year follow-up of the first large CEA trial.7 However, the
results of another study led to CEA testing being recom-
mended by Verberne et al.23 For luminal recurrence, the
follow-up method of choice is colonoscopy. However, lumi-
nal recurrence seldom occurs and detection programs have
shown no effect.24
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, turnover of respon-
sible investigators and staff in many recruitment centers dur-
ingalongstudyperiodisapossibleweaknessbecauseanynon-
adherence to the protocol would most likely bias this trial’
s
findings toward the null.19,25,26 However, the adherence to the
follow-up protocol was good and similar to the FACS trial.12
A second concern is that due to the nature of the study de-
sign, it was not possible to blind patients and physicians to the
frequencyofthefollow-upexaminations.14Third,anintention-
to-treatanalysiswilltendtounderestimateaneffect,19,25,27but
such bias was likely small because the per-protocol analysis
produced similar results. Fourth, survival was higher than ex-
pected in both the present trial and in the FACS trial.12 With
fewer outcomes than expected, the statistical power to de-
tect a small significant between-group difference was re-
duced. Fifth, lack of systematic recording of potential ad-
verseeventsmighthaveledtounderestimationoftheseevents.

Conclusions
Among patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer, follow-up
testing with computed tomography and carcinoembryonic an-
tigen more frequently compared with less frequently did not
result in a significant rate reduction in 5-year overall mortal-
ity or colorectal cancer–specific mortality.
