IMPORTANCE Risk assessment tools for exercise treadmill testing may have limited external
validity. Cardiovascular mortality has decreased in recent decades, and women have been
underrepresented in prior cohorts.
OBJECTIVES To determine whether exercise and clinical variables are associated with
differential mortality outcomes in men and women and to assess whether sex-specific risk
scores better estimate all-cause mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included 59 877
patients seen at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF cohort) from January 1, 2000, through
December 31, 2010, and 49 278 patients seen at the Henry Ford Hospital (FIT cohort) from
January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2009. All patients were 18 years or older and
underwent exercise treadmill testing. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2000, to October
27, 2011, in the CCF cohort and from January 1, 1991, to April 1, 2013, in the FIT cohort.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASUREMENTS The CCF cohort was divided randomly into derivation
and validation samples, and separate risk scores were developed for men and women. Net
reclassification, C statistics, and integrated discrimination improvement were used to
compare the sex-specific risk scores with other tools that have all-cause mortality as the
outcome. Discrimination and calibration were also evaluated with these sex-specific risk
scores in the FIT cohort.
RESULTS The CCF cohort included 59 877 patients (59.4% men; 40.5% women) with a
median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 54 (45-63) years and 2521 deaths (4.2%) during a
median follow-up of 7 (IQR, 4.1-9.6) years. The FIT cohort included 49 278 patients (52.5%
men; 47.4% women) with a median (IQR) age of 54 (46-64) years and 6643 deaths (13.5%)
during a median (IQR) follow-up of 10.2 (7-13.4) years. C statistics for the sex-specific risk
scores in the CCF validation sample were higher (0.79 in women and 0.81 in men) than
C statistics using other tools in women (0.70 for Duke Treadmill Score; 0.74 for Lauer
nomogram) and men (0.72 for Duke Treadmill Score; 0.75 for Lauer nomogram). Net
reclassification and integrated discrimination improvement were superior with the
sex-specific risk scores, mostly owing to correct reclassification of events. The sex-specific
risk scores in the FIT cohort demonstrated similar discrimination (C statistic, 0.78 for women
and 0.79 for men), and calibration was reasonable.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Sex-specific risk scores better estimate mortality in patients
undergoing exercise treadmill testing. In particular, these sex-specific risk scores help to
identify patients at the highest residual risk in the present era.

E
xercise testing is recommended to assess prognosis in
patients with known or suspected coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD) who present with symptoms suggestive of
worsening ischemic heart disease.1 For nearly 3 decades, the
Duke Treadmill Score (DTS) has been the standard to assess
prognosis in these patients.2 However, during the past few de-
cades, advances in therapy have dramatically reduced cardio-
vascular mortality,3 and the validity of this score in a contem-
porary population is unclear. The DTS was also developed in
a predominantly male population, and a paucity of data re-
garding risk stratification with this score exists in women.4
Finally, the DTS incorporates only exercise duration,
ST-segment depression, and exercise-induced chest pain.2
Other exercise variables are associated with prognosis,5-7 and
many of these patients have cardiovascular comorbidities that
also affect their overall risk.
To address this latter concern, a nomogram was created
by Lauer and colleagues8 that is superior to the DTS at pre-
dicting all-cause mortality. The broader clinical use of this no-
mogram is unclear and in part has been limited by exclusion
of certain patient populations, including those with known
CAD, valvular heart disease, heart failure, and end-stage re-
nal disease (ESRD). Furthermore, sex-related differences in the
prognostic impact of exercise test variables and cardiovascu-
lar comorbidities should be accounted for.9,10 We therefore
aimed to develop comprehensive sex-specific risk scores to es-
timate all-cause mortality in a more inclusive and contempo-
rary population. We then determined whether these sex-
specific risk scores better estimated mortality when compared
with the DTS and Lauer nomogram. Finally, we validated these
sex-specific risk scores by assessing discrimination and cali-
bration in an external cohort.
Methods
Cleveland Clinic Cohort
From a cohort of 60 895 consecutive patients undergoing
symptom-limited treadmill testing at the Cleveland Clinic
Foundation (CCF) from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2010,
1018 were excluded owing to atrial fibrillation, a resting elec-
trocardiogram that precluded interpretation of the ST seg-
ment, digoxin use, being younger than 18 years, or having no
Social Security number available. The final CCF cohort in-
cluded 59 877 patients.
At the time of stress testing, patient demographic charac-
teristics, comorbidities, and medications were prospectively
entered into a stress database. Known CAD was defined as a
previous myocardial infarction, previous percutaneous coro-
nary intervention, or a history of coronary artery bypass graft-
ing. Heart failure was defined by self-reported history and re-
view of the medical record. Hypertension was defined as self-
reported history or use of antihypertensives. Hyperlipidemia
was defined as an abnormal fasting lipid panel according to
Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, self-reported history, or
use of medications to lower lipid levels. Diabetes was defined
as a fasting blood glucose level of at least 126 mg/dL (to con-
vert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555), self-reported
history, or use of medication to lower glucose levels. Patients
who were actively smoking cigarettes or who had smoked
within the past year were considered current smokers, and pa-
tients who had smoked less recently were considered to have
a history of smoking. We defined ESRD as receiving dialysis.
Patients underwent symptom-limited treadmill testing
using a protocol based on a pretest estimation of exercise ca-
pacity and designed to have the patient reach maximal exer-
tion within 8 to 12 minutes, as suggested by exercise testing
guidelines.1 Standard exercise protocols were used, and most
patients performed a Bruce protocol (61%). Other protocols in-
cluded Cornell, Naughton, modified Naughton, and modi-
fied Bruce.1 Heart rate targets were not used as an end point
or to judge the adequacy of the test. The ST segment was mea-
sured 80 milliseconds after the J point, and the magnitude of
STdepressionwasrecordedasthegreatesthorizontalordown-
sloping ST-segment depression in any lead except aVR dur-
ing the test or in recovery.
Blood pressure was measured during every stage of the
test.Heartratewasrecordedfromanelectrocardiogramprinted
everyminuteduringthetest.Peakestimatedmetabolicequiva-
lents of task (METs) were calculated from treadmill speed and
grade at peak exercise. Chest discomfort during the test was
recorded as none, nonlimiting chest pain, or test-limiting chest
pain. Rate-pressure product (RPP) was calculated as the prod-
uct of heart rate and systolic blood pressure. A ΔRPP was cal-
culated as RPP at peak exercise minus RPP at rest. Heart rate
recovery (HRR) was calculated as peak exercise heart rate mi-
nus heart rate at 1 minute after exercise.
Patients were given a standard walking recovery for tests
involving electrocardiography only, technetium imaging, or
metabolic stress testing. For patients undergoing stress ech-
ocardiography, a supine recovery immediately after exercise
was used. Therefore, HRR at 1 minute was classified as abnor-
mal if 12 or fewer beats/min for patients undergoing upright
recovery and abnormal if 18 or fewer beats/min in patients un-
dergoing stress echocardiography.5,11,12 Chronotropic reserve
index was calculated as (Peak heart rate – resting heart rate)/
[(220 – age) – resting heart rate] and was considered abnor-
mal if no greater than 0.8 for patients not taking a β-blocker
and abnormal if at least 0.62 for patients taking a β-blocker.
In patients who did not undergo a Bruce protocol, the esti-
mated METs achieved by each patient were converted to min-
utes per the Bruce protocol before calculation of the DTS.
Key Points
Question Do sex-specific risk scores better estimate all-cause
mortality for patients undergoing exercise treadmill testing?
Findings In a retrospective cohort study of nearly 110 000
patients, sex-specific risk scores better estimated mortality.
Exercise capacity had the greatest effect on prognosis in both
sexes, and all risk factors had a differential effect on prognosis in
women compared with men.
Meaning Risk stratification is improved with sex-specific risk
scores, and in particular, patients at the highest risk are more
readily identified.

The DTS was calculated as Exercise time – (5 × maximum
ST-segment depression) – (4 × treadmill chest pain index).
Treadmill chest pain was scored from 0 to 2, with 0 represent-
ing no chest pain; 1, nonlimiting chest pain; and 2, chest pain
for which the exercise test was terminated.2
Validation Cohort
The Henry Ford Exercise Testing (FIT) cohort is from a regis-
try of 69 885 consecutive patients who had physician-
referred exercise treadmill tests at the Henry Ford Health
System from January 1, 1991, through December 31, 2009.
Methodologic details have been reported previously.13 In
brief, patients older than 18 years who underwent exercise
treadmill tests were included. All testing used the standard
Bruce protocol. Exercise test, medical history, and medica-
tion data were collected at the time of testing, and support-
ing clinical data were derived from the electronic medical
record and administrative databases. For external validation
purposes, the 3880 patients without recorded weight and
the 16 727 without glomerular filtration rate data were
excluded. A final sample size of 49 278 patients was included
for external validation.
All data in both cohorts were deidentified. The institu-
tional review boards at CCF, Henry Ford Health System, and
Johns Hopkins Hospital approved this study with an exemp-
tion for individual patient consent.
Outcome
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and was deter-
mined from the Social Security Death Index Master File. Pre-
vious work14 demonstrated that more than 95% of the time the
Social Security Death Index correctly identifies patients who
have died. The final censoring date was October 27, 2011, in
the CCF cohort, and April 1, 2013, in the FIT cohort.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from January 1, 2000, to October 27, 2011,
in the CCF cohort and from January 1, 1991, to April 1, 2013, in
the FIT cohort. For men and women, the CCF sample was di-
vided randomly, with 50% of patients in the derivation co-
hort and 50% in the validation cohort. All data analysis to de-
velop risk scores was performed in the derivation cohorts. Data
are summarized as median and interquartile range (IQR) for
continuous data and number (percentage) of nonmissing data
forcategoricalvariables.Comparisonsacrossagecategoriesand
survival status used 2-tailed unpaired t tests for continuous
variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables. Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models were used to create sepa-
rate multivariable models for men and women to determine
independent risk factors for all-cause mortality.
All variables that were significantly associated with all-
cause mortality on univariable analysis (P < .05) were consid-
ered for multivariable adjustment. Bootstrapping methods
were used to identify variables for inclusion in the final mod-
els.Twohundredbootstrappedmodelsweregeneratedformen
andwomen;variablesthatwereenteredintothemodelsatleast
50% of the time were then entered into a backward stepwise
selection modeling process to create separate Cox models for
men and women. These Cox models were validated for cali-
bration accuracy to estimate overall survival (eMethods in the
Supplement).
TheCoxmodelsfromthederivationcohortwerethenused
to develop sex-specific risk scores for estimating mortality. To
assign value to each variable in creating a risk score, catego-
ries were created for the continuous variables in the model.
Creation of these categories was based on the distribution of
eachvariable.Linearitywastestedwithrestrictedcubicsplines.
Continuous variables were divided into quartiles with the ex-
ception of age for women and weight for men. The β coeffi-
cients across quartiles were similar for these variables; thus,
age for women was divided into older than 65 years or 65 years
or younger, and weight for men was divided into more than
80 kg or 80 kg or less. The β coefficients of each covariate in
these categories were then used to assign points for every risk
factor (eMethods in the Supplement). The points were then
added together to obtain a total score. Overall, 7% of data were
missing. To reduce bias in estimates and uncertainty related
to the imputation model, multiple imputation of missing vari-
ables was performed with a regression-based method. In the
CCF validation cohorts, discrimination was assessed with re-
ceiver operating characteristic curves and Harrell C statistics,
category-free net reclassification improvement, and inte-
grated discrimination improvement.15
TheFITcohortservedasanexternalvalidationcohort.The
risk scores were modified because certain data were not avail-
able in both cohorts. Heart rate recovery was not available in
the FIT database and was excluded from the models using this
cohort. A history of smoking was not available in the FIT co-
hortandwasreplacedwithcurrentsmoking.Finally,ESRDwas
not categorized in the FIT cohort and was replaced by glomer-
ular filtration rate of less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2. Discrimina-
tion with these modifications to the risk scores was assessed
with receiver operating characteristic curves and Harrell C sta-
tistics. Calibration was assessed by dividing the risk scores into
deciles for men and women and plotting observed vs pre-
dicted mortality.
AllanalyseswereperformedusingSAS(version9.2;SASIn-
stitute Inc), R (R CoreTeam 2015 [http://www.R-project.org/]),
and STATA (version 14.0; StataCorp) statistical software. Two-
tailed P < .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient Characteristics
Owing to known differences in the prevalence and impact of
comorbidities and exercise variables between men and
women,10 the 59 877 patients in the CCF cohort were divided
by sex (59.4% men; 40.5% women) for all analyses. Overall,
the median age was 54 (IQR, 45-63) years, and 66.4% of the
populationwaswhite.Cardiovascularcomorbiditiesweremore

eral arterial disease. In men, death was also associated with a
lower body mass index and a family history of coronary dis-
ease. With regard to exercise variables, death was associated
with ST-segment depression, lower maximal heart rate, lower
maximal RPP and ΔRPP, lower peak METs, an abnormal HRR,
and an abnormal chronotropic reserve index. A lower DTS was
alsoassociatedwithincreasedmortality,butnoassociationwas
found between nonlimiting or limiting chest pain and mortal-
ity (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Developing the Sex-Specific Risk Scores
In multivariable Cox models, lower peak estimated METs, ab-
normal HRR, increasing age, lower body weight, current or for-
mer smoking, and ESRD were all associated with mortality in
men and women (eTable 3 in the Supplement). In addition, a
history of diabetes was associated with mortality in women,
whereas a history of heart failure and hypertension were as-
sociatedwithmortalityinmen.TheseCoxmodelsshowedgood
calibration at predicting mortality at 10 years (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). The β coefficients from these Cox proportional
hazards regression models were then used to assign points for
each covariate (Table 2). The final risk scores for women and
men showed high discrimination in estimating mortality in the
derivation cohorts (C statistic for women, 0.82; C statistic for
men, 0.81).
Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis
Although the DTS was associated with mortality when as-
sessed as a continuous variable, differentiation of risk was lim-
ited when assessed according to the typical DTS categories. In
particular,fewpatientshadhigh-riskDTSsthatresultedinwide
and overlapping 95% CIs. Similar results were obtained in men
and women (Figure 1A and C). Of note, 78 women (0.3%) and
221men(0.6%)hadhigh-riskDTSs.Conversely,survivalcurves
using the sex-specific risk scores effectively identified pa-
tients at highest risk for all-cause mortality (Figure 1B and D),
as is also evident in the estimate of 10-year mortality risk ac-
cording to the sex-specific risk scores (eTables 4 and 5 in the
Supplement).
Validating the Risk Scores
For the sex-specific risk scores, C statistics were similar in the
CCF validation cohorts (0.79 for women and 0.81 for men).
These sex-specific risk scores also performed better at esti-
mating mortality when compared with the other models in
women (C statistic for DTS, 0.70; C statistic for Lauer nomo-
gram, 0.74) (eFigure 2A in the Supplement) and in men (C sta-
tistic for DTS, 0.72; C statistic for Lauer nomogram, 0.75) (eFig-
ure 2B in the Supplement). Category-free net reclassification
improvementandintegrateddiscriminationimprovementwere
also significantly improved with the sex-specific risk scores
when compared with the DTS and the Lauer nomogram
(Table 3). This improved discrimination primarily corre-
sponded to the correct reclassification of patients who died.
Finally, sex-specific risk scores were calculated for pa-
tients in the FIT cohort to assess external validation. At a me-
dian follow-up of 10.2 years, there were 6643 deaths in a popu-
lation of 49 278 (13.5%). The C statistics for the sex-specific risk
scores were similar in women (0.78) and men (0.79). Regard-
ing calibration, good tracking of observed vs predicted mor-
tality was found (Figure 2).
Discussion
The present study is, to our knowledge, the largest to date to
developsex-specificprognosticriskscoresusingtreadmilltest-
ing data. We have demonstrated excellent discrimination and
calibration for estimating mortality in the CCF derivation and
validation cohorts. Moreover, in the CCF validation cohort,
C statistics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated
discrimination improvement with these new sex-specific risk
scores were improved compared with the DTS and Lauer no-
mogram. Finally, discrimination and calibration were also rea-
sonable when the sex-specific risk scores were tested exter-
nally in the FIT cohort.
A few important observations from our study should be
highlighted. First, in patients undergoing treadmill testing, our

data support separate risk scores according to sex. Certain vari-
ables are present or absent in the models for men vs women,
and the hazard ratios for risk factors common to both models
differ according to sex. Therefore, rather than simply adjust-
ingforsex,wearguethatasex-specificapproachshouldbecon-
sidered when assessing the prognosis for patients who un-
dergo exercise testing. In addition, although many variables
are associated with mortality and refine risk stratification, de-
creased exercise capacity is the most important risk factor for
men and women. Finally, as shown in our category-free net
reclassification improvement, the major advantage of our risk
scores is the identification of patients who are likely to have a
fatal event. As cardiovascular mortality continues to decline,3
identification of patients with the highest residual risk is in-
creasingly important.
Previous Studies
The DTS remains the most common method to assess prog-
nosis in patients with exercise testing, although this score was
developed in higher-risk patients—predominantly middle-
aged men—who all had chest pain and invasive coronary
angiography.2 In a lower-risk and more diverse patient popu-
lation, our study demonstrates that the prognostic value of the
DTS is related solely to the importance of exercise capacity.
Chest pain and ST depression with exertion were not associ-

ated with mortality in multivariable models. The Lauer no-
mogram improved on the DTS by incorporating other exer-
cise variables and comorbidities.8 However, notable patient
populations were excluded. Our objective was to create more
comprehensive risk scores with a more inclusive patient popu-
lation. This approach facilitates a broader clinical use for our
sex-specific risk scores.
Limitations
Our study has several notable limitations. First, we assessed
all-cause instead of cardiac death, although all-cause mor-
tality may be preferred because it is an unbiased end point.
Second, imaging data were not included in our analysis and
have been shown to have prognostic importance.16,17 How-
ever, the focus of this study was to develop risk scores
based on clinical and exercise variables alone. Third, all
patients in the study underwent evaluation at large referral
centers, and generalizability to smaller hospitals may be
limited. Finally, because of differences in data collection,
the risk scores tested in the FIT cohort were similar, but not
identical, to the scores used in the CCF cohort. Discrimina-
tion was good in both cohorts, but this observation should
not lead to the exclusion of certain variables in risk assess-
ment, especially because HRR has emerged as a risk factor
in several studies.7,11,12,18 In fact, in a well-developed model,
little change may occur in the C statistic when an additional
variable is added, even if that variable improves risk
stratification.19
Conclusions
In a large cohort of patients who underwent treadmill test-
ing, we have demonstrated a differential effect of exercise vari-
ables and clinical risk factors on overall mortality according to

Invited Commentary
Can We Improve Mortality Estimation in Women
After Treadmill Testing by Using Sex-Specific Scores?
Ashok Krishnaswami, MD, MAS; Jeff W. Christle, MA; Victor Froelicher, MD
The use of predictive analytics in modern cardiology has
had a significant impact in decreasing the subjectivity of
forecasting cardiovascular events. The abundance of cur-
rently available clinical pre-
diction models (CPMs) has
been demonstrated by a
recent systematic review.1
This review unearthed 796 scientific articles on the topic of
CPMs and cardiovascular disease published from 1990 to
2012, with 90% being novel and the remainder recalibration
or other adaptations of prior CPMs. Although utilization of
CPMs is currently low, it promises to decrease use of the rou-
tine subjective eyeball test.2
To establish an anatomical diagnosis of coronary artery
disease and to estimate the probability of future cardiac
events is a difficult task. This concept is not dissimilar to the
Heisenberg “uncertainty principle” in which a particle’
s
position and momentum cannot be known with complete
precision.3 Therefore, working in this arena requires an
acceptance of some uncertainty. The exercise treadmill test
has been recommended as a routine first-line test for indi-
viduals capable of exercising with no contraindications and
without an abnormal resting electrocardiographic finding.4
However, concern about its low sensitivity and specificity
(leading to false-positive findings), owing to an undue focus
on the ST segment often results in the use of additional
imaging modalities (myocardial perfusion or echocardiogra-
phy). Advanced CPMs have come to the rescue and have
been shown to be superior to subjective prognostication.5
They have improved the accuracy of diagnosis of coronary
artery disease and the prognosis of future cardiovascular
events, reduced costs, and aided the decision-making
process.6,7
In this issue of JAMA Cardiology, Cremer et al8 have tied
together 3 important areas in cardiovascular medicine: the
use of CPMs, sex-specific research,9 and treadmill testing.
The investigators used the Cleveland Clinic Foundation
(CCF) cohort for derivation and internal validation and the
Henry Ford Exercise Testing (FIT) cohort for external valida-
tion. The study examined the hypothesis that sex-specific
CPMs are superior to general models that have been risk
adjusted for sex, such as the Lauer score.10 The models were
tested using standard discrimination and calibration statis-
tics. Patients in the CCF cohort underwent symptom-limited
treadmill testing using multiple treadmill protocols. Comor-
bidities were obtained at the time of the baseline treadmill
test. Subsequent prognostic variables, such as the Duke
Treadmill Score, chronotropic reserve index, and rate-
pressure product, were then calculated using standard
treadmill variables that were also obtained at the time of
baseline testing. The primary outcome of all-cause mortality
was determined by the Social Security Death Index Master
File. Covariate β coefficients were obtained using time-to-
event analysis (Cox proportional hazards regression model)
with a backward-stepwise covariate selection that was sub-
sequently used to develop a linear score.
The study findings demonstrated that the women re-
ferred for exercise testing were younger, were less often white,
