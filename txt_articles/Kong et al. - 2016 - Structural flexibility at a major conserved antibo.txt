Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease, affecting
over 2% of the world’s population. The HCV envelope glycopro-
teins E1 and E2 mediate viral entry, with E2 being the main target
of neutralizing antibody responses. Structural investigations of E2
have produced templates for vaccine design, including the con-
served CD81 receptor-binding site (CD81bs) that is a key target
of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Unfortunately, immu-
nization with recombinant E2 and E1E2 rarely elicits sufficient lev-
els of bNAbs for protection. To understand the challenges for
eliciting bNAb responses against the CD81bs, we investigated
the E2 CD81bs by electron microscopy (EM), hydrogen–deuterium
exchange (HDX), molecular dynamics (MD), and calorimetry. By
EM, we observed that HCV1, a bNAb recognizing the N-terminal
region of the CD81bs, bound a soluble E2 core construct from
multiple angles of approach, suggesting components of the CD81bs
are flexible. HDX of multiple E2 constructs consistently indicated the
entire CD81bs was flexible relative to the rest of the E2 protein,
which was further confirmed by MD simulations. However, E2 has
a high melting temperature of 84.8 °C, which is more akin to pro-
teins from thermophilic organisms. Thus, recombinant E2 is a highly
stable protein overall, but with an exceptionally flexible CD81bs.
Such flexibility may promote induction of nonneutralizing anti-
bodies over bNAbs to E2 CD81bs, underscoring the necessity of rigid-
ifying this antigenic region as a target for rational vaccine design.

H
epatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis
and hepatocellular carcinoma, infecting more than 2% of
the world’s population (1). HCV infection is highly prevalent in
developing countries and among marginalized populations, such
as injection drug users (IDUs) and prisoners in developed coun-
tries (2). Effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs have been
developed recently to curb the advance of HCV (3, 4). Never-
theless, new infections are on the rise among young IDUs in
developed countries and along drug-trafficking routes (2, 5, 6).
Because DAA treatment is prohibitively expensive and does not
prevent reinfection (7, 8), an effective vaccine is essential for
management of the global HCV epidemic (9–11).
Despite the significant public health burden, no effective pro-
phylactic vaccine against HCV has been developed. High genetic
variability of the virus is a major barrier, particularly in the E1 and
E2 envelope glycoproteins that are the primary neutralizing anti-
body (NAb) targets. E2, the receptor-binding protein, mediates
cell entry by interacting with the tetraspanin CD81 and several
other cell surface molecules (12, 13). The crystal structure of the
E2 core domain (E2c) consists of a central β-sandwich flanked by
“front” and “back” layers (14) (Fig. 1). The CD81-binding site
(CD81bs) has been mapped by mutagenesis and electron mi-
croscopy (EM) to various elements: a conserved N-terminal re-
gion (residues 412–423), the front layer (residues 424–453), and
the adjacent CD81-binding loop (CD81bl; residues 519–535)
(14–16) (Fig. 1). The CD81bs is also a conserved antigenic site
recognized by multiple broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs)
and, therefore, an important target for HCV vaccine design. So
far, three distinct clusters of neutralizing epitopes, or antigenic
sites, have been identified within the CD81bs. The first antigenic
site (AS412) consists of the conserved N-terminal end of the
CD81bs spanning residues 412–423. The bNAbs AP33, HCV1,
HC33.1, and 3/11 primarily bind to E2 at AS412, and their in-
teractions have been structurally characterized (17–22). The
second antigenic site (AS434) consists of a short α-helix in the
front layer residues 434–446. The bNAbs HC84-1 and HC84-27
and the weakly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) 8 pri-
marily recognize this helical region (23, 24). The third cluster of
neutralizing epitopes that we call antigenic region 3 (AR3) is a
discontinuous surface composed of the entire front layer, in-
cluding AS434, and the adjacent CD81bl. AR3 is recognized by a
family of potent bNAbs consisting of AR3A, AR3B, AR3C, and
AR3D (25, 26).
There is ample evidence that the E2 CD81bs is accessible and
immunogenic on the virion and on recombinant E2. First, the
CD81bs is recognized by bNAbs with different angles of ap-
proach (9) (Fig. S1). Second, although E2 is densely glycosylated,
Significance
Hepatitis C virus is an important human pathogen, and its E2
envelope glycoprotein is the major target of neutralizing an-
tibodies (NAbs) and, hence, a promising vaccine candidate.
Many broadly NAbs (bNAbs) to E2 recognize the conserved
receptor-binding site, but immunization with soluble E2 anti-
gen rarely elicits a potent bNAb response. Here, we show that
soluble E2 is highly stable except for the receptor-binding site
and variable loops. Thus, despite high sequence conservation,
structural flexibility at the receptor-binding site may distract
the immune system from eliciting bNAbs that recognize the
conformation required for its function on virions. Stabilization
of the E2 CD81 receptor-binding site (CD81bs) by structure-based
design may improve its performance as a vaccine candidate.

 the CD81bs is not obstructed by any of the 11 N-linked glycans
(14). Third, antibody responses to the CD81bs are frequently
detected in sera from subjects immunized with the candidate
vaccine immunogens: soluble E2 or E1E2. However, these serum
antibodies are often weak or nonneutralizing despite high anti-
E1E2 antibody titers (14, 27–30). Indeed, mAbs have been iso-
lated to the different components of the CD81bs, but only a few
(mentioned above) cross-neutralize the highly diverse HCV
genotypes (30–33). In a panel of 37 mAbs isolated from mice
immunized with E1E2, 20 (54%) and four (11%) bind to the E2
front layer and CD81bl, respectively, but none neutralize HCV
(30). The results indicate that the E2 front layer and CD81bl are
highly immunogenic but likely contain structural features that
act as decoys for the immune system, skewing the response to
nonneutralizing epitopes during immunization. Interestingly, in
the antibody panel, of seven mAbs that bind subsite AS412, six
are neutralizing, suggesting at least that AS412 is presented
correctly; however, sufficient levels of NAbs were not produced
in the animals. Thus, to understand how to elicit bNAbs to the
E2 CD81bs, it is necessary to investigate anti-CD81bs antibodies
and the E2 antigens in depth.
In this study, we first investigated the molecular features of the
E2 CD81bs. We used EM to elucidate the interactions between
E2 and a bNAb targeting AS412. Next, we mapped the surface
accessibility and flexibility of E2 through hydrogen–deuterium
exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS). The HDX results were
then corroborated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
using available crystal structures. To assess the overall stability of
E2, we used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and de-
termined binding entropies of various E2 ligands using isother-
mal titration calorimetry (ITC). The combined results suggest
recombinant E2 is a highly stable protein with an exceptionally
flexible receptor-binding site that can present many nonoptimal
conformations/configurations during immunization. Furthermore,
we can now use this information to guide engineering efforts to
stabilize the E2 CD81bs to advance HCV vaccine design.
Results and Discussion
Flexibility at the E2 CD81bs as Visualized by EM. The first structural
investigations of HCV E2 revealed that AS412 within the E2
CD81bs, when presented as a synthetic peptide, forms a β-hair-
pin when bound to bNAbs HCV1 and AP33 (17–20). Both
HCV1 and AP33 interact with one face of the AS412 β-hairpin,
whereas the opposite face contains an N-linked glycan. These
initial results suggest that both faces of the AS412 β-hairpin are
solvent-accessible and that AS412 might protrude from the E2
protein as a potentially flexible, flap-like structure (18). Interest-
ingly, AS412 is disordered in the published HCV E2c crystal
structure (14). Furthermore, recent structures of the AS412
peptide in complex with bNAbs HC33.1 and 3/11 revealed very
different, extended conformations for the peptide (21, 22).
To investigate the flexibility of AS412 in the context of E2, we
sought to visualize directly any structural heterogeneity in the
interaction between bNAb HCV1 and an E2c variant (E2c2; the
amino acid sequence of E2c variants are shown in Fig. S2)
containing a full variable region 2 (VR2) (Fig. 1 and Fig. S3).
Assuming that HCV1 primarily interacts with E2 via AS412,
flexibility at AS412 should translate to larger, rigid-body motions
for HCV1, as previously observed for anti–HIV-1 bNAb PG9
when bound to HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 as a mono-
mer (34). Therefore, we formed a complex composed of partially
deglycosylated E2c2 bound to the antigen-binding fragments
(Fabs) of mAb AR2A, mAb AR1B, and bNAb HCV1, and
performed reference-free alignment and classification. Previ-
ously, we showed by mutagenesis or negative-stain EM that at-
tachment of AR2A or AR1B to E2 did not significantly alter
binding of CD81 or mAb AR3C (14). AR2A and AR1B were
incorporated into the complex as fiduciary markers to help orient
the E2 structure. Interestingly, substantial heterogeneity was
observed at one protrusion in the 2D classes that corresponded
to a single Fab. Because of this heterogeneity, we collected
random conical tilt (RCT) EM data of the complex and calculated
multiple 3D reconstructions (Fig. 1 and Fig. S3). Altogether, the
2D classes were consistent with three separate 3D reconstructions,
each containing three protrusions of density corresponding to each
of the three Fabs used to construct the complex, with E2c2 at the
center. As expected from the 2D classes, there was substantial
structural variation for one of the Fabs. To assign identities to each
EM density protrusion, we relied on a previous mapping study
(25), an alanine scanning experiment (Table S1), the E2c/AR3C
Fab complex crystal structure (14), and the E2c-AR2A-CD81 EM
structure (14). In this manner, we were able to assign AR2A and
AR1B unambiguously to protrusions in the reconstruction that
extend in opposite directions from each other. The third EM
protrusion was consistent with the location of AS412 on E2
based on the AR1B and AR2A assignments. We therefore
identified this more variable protrusion as the HCV1 Fab. Re-
markably, the HCV1 Fab exhibited 10–22° variation in the angle
of approach between the three 3D reconstructions (Fig. 1).
Compared with the nearly 180° variation observed for anti-HIV1
bNAb PG9 when bound to HIV-1 gp120 monomer, the flexibility
of HCV1 is modest. However, PG9 recognizes the V1V2 loop,
which is 57–80 residues and highly flexible in the context of
gp120 monomer, whereas HCV1 recognizes AS412, which is
merely 12 residues and only five residues from the first disulfide
bond to the core of the E2 protein. Thus, the observed variability

 of HCV1 is consistent with the originally proposed hypothesis
that AS412 is a flap-like structure with structural flexibility, but
somewhat constrained by the close proximity to the rest of the E2
protein (18). Of note, the negative-stain EM results are not of
sufficient resolution to elucidate whether small, local confor-
mational changes could occur in the E2 front layer and/or
CD81bl in the antibody-bound E2.
Mapping the Conformational Flexibility of HCV E2 by HDX. Next, we
sought to extend our investigation on flexibility to the rest of the
E2 protein using HDX. HDX tracks the rate of deuterium in-
corporation into the backbone amides of proteins when exposed
to deuterated solvent, and is highly dependent on the confor-
mational flexibility and accessibility of individual residues in the
protein (35). Here, we used HDXMS to measure the masses of
enzymatically cleaved peptides from E2 after E2 had been ex-
posed to deuterated solvent over different lengths of time and
then quenched to stop the exchange (36). In this manner, three
complexes were analyzed with HDX: partially deglycosylated
E2c2 bound to Fab AR2A (E2c2-AR2A), partially deglycosy-
lated E2c2 bound to Fabs AR2A and AP33 (E2c2-AR2A-AP33),
and partially deglycosylated full-length E2 ectodomain (E2ΔTM)
bound to Fabs AR2A and AP33 (E2ΔTM-AR2A-AP33). The
E2 proteins were enzymatically deglycosylated with endogly-
cosidase H (EndoH) to maximize the identification of peptides
and the overall peptide coverage of the proteins. Fab AR2A,
which does not bind to the CD81bs, was required in the degly-
cosylation step to prevent E2 aggregation and ensure complete
protease digestion.
Multiple peptic fragments of the complexes were identified by
MS, covering 85% of E2c2 and 60% of E2ΔTM (Figs. S4 and S5).
Considering the relatively small size of E2 in relation to its rela-
tively large proportion of prolines that are inaccessible by HDX
(25 of 335 E2ΔTM residues are prolines), the variable glycosyla-
tion states of the proteins, and the low yield of glycopeptides
identifiable in MS, the HDX coverage achieved in this study is on
par with a previous HDX study of Ebola virus envelope glyco-
protein (37). To facilitate analysis, we focused on high-quality
peptides that defined nonoverlapping regions across the protein
sequence. Overall, the results indicated that E2c2 in the E2c2/
AR2A complex is flexible, with nine of 15 nonoverlapping peptide
regions having greater than 50% deuterium exchange by the first
time point. E2 peptides with lower deuterium exchange include
one peptide within the β-sandwich, which is expected to be rela-
tively stable because it is involved in backbone hydrogen bonds and
relatively inaccessible, and five peptide regions within the back
layer, which are protected by interaction with Fab AR2A (Fig. 2 A
and B and Fig. S5). The most flexible regions are the front layer of
the CD81bs and VR2, with over 90% deuterium exchange for all
peptides by the first time point (10 s) (Fig. 2A). The variable region
3 (VR3) on E2 is also highly flexible, as expected from its high
B-values in the available crystal structures, with 80% deuterium
exchange by the first time point compared with 50% deuterium
exchange for the peptides covering the β-sandwich. This high
global rate of deuterium exchange is comparable to the global
deuterium exchange rate of HIV-1 gp120 monomer (38), another
viral envelope glycoprotein known to be quite flexible from
structural studies (39), and is consistent with the use of flexibility
by viral proteins to tolerate mutations (40). To validate our
method, we used HDX to map the known bNAb AP33 epitope,
which, like the epitope of HCV1, consists of the AS412 with no
additional E2 protein components (18, 19) (Fig. S5). As expected,
the HDX profile of E2c2-AR2A-AP33 is mostly equivalent to the
profile of E2c2-AR2A except with much slower exchange at
Asn415-Trp420 within AS412 (Fig. 2B).
Next, we sought to extend our HDX studies to the full-length
E2ΔTM, which includes hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) and the
C-terminal stalk (residues 384–411 and 646–717, respectively),
both of which are truncated in E2c2. A previous EM study with
E2ΔTM suggested that HVR1 might pack against a highly con-
served hydrophobic surface identified on E2c (14). Thus, HVR1
might aid in stabilizing E2 by covering this hydrophobic surface,
which, in turn, might stabilize HVR1 through the interaction.
The same study also suggested that the C-terminal stalk region
might be packed closely against the E2 back layer, further im-
plying that the additional E2 protein regions on E2ΔTM that are
absent in E2c2 could have an overall stabilizing effect. However,
the HDX results for E2ΔTM in an E2ΔTM/AR2A/AP33 com-
plex were surprisingly comparable to the results for E2c2 de-
scribed above (Fig. S5). For example, the peptide regions that
overlap between E2ΔTM and E2c2 displayed similar levels of
Fig. 2.

 flexibility, suggesting the HVR1 and the C-terminal stalk did not
stabilize the core of the E2 protein. Nevertheless, two peptide
fragments from the front layer had less deuterium exchange in
E2ΔTM compared with E2c2, although this reduced deuterium
exchange was modest and only apparent at the earliest time
point (10 s) and more subject to experimental variability (Fig.
S5). Lower exchange in the front layer is also shown in a pre-
viously published HDX study of fully glycosylated E2ΔTM from
a different strain (41). Furthermore, over 90% deuterium ex-
change was observed for all peptides spanning HVR1 of E2ΔTM
by the first time point, suggesting HVR1 is at least as flexible as
the front layer and VR2 of E2c2. Thus, in addition to being
hypervariable in sequence, HVR1 is highly exposed and likely
very heterogeneous in conformation, which could serve to dis-
tract the immune response. Finally, the C-terminal stalk region
also appeared flexible in our study, with four of seven peptide
regions having more than 60% deuterium exchange by the first
time point. Although less flexible than the front layer or HVR1,
the deuterium exchange profile of the C-terminal stalk is com-
parable to the long CD81bl extending from the β-sandwich
(Gly523–Asp535) in E2c2.
Importantly, our HDX studies revealed that the E2 front layer,
which constitutes most of the CD81bs, is remarkably flexible.
Although displaying slower deuterium exchange than the front
layer, the CD81bl is also relatively flexible compared with other
E2 regions. The high flexibility was not notably affected by the
presence or absence of HVR1 or the C-terminal stalk. The high
flexibility of the front layer is surprising because in the crystal
structure, 20% of the front layer consists of a helical region,
whose backbone amides should be protected through hydrogen
bonding, and because the front layer is stapled to the rest of the
E2 protein by two disulfide bonds in a manner that partially
buries multiple front layer backbone amides. Nonetheless, this
finding now provides a possible explanation of recent structural
studies of antibodies that target AS434 on the front layer. Spe-
cifically, HC84-27 (23) and weakly neutralizing mAb 8 (24) bind
to a peptide spanning AS434 from opposite sides (Fig. S6).
When superposed on the E2c-AR3C crystal structure, bNAb
HC84-27 does not clash with the E2 protein and binds at an
angle of approach comparable to bNAb AR3C, the antibody
present in the E2c crystal structure. However, mAb 8 would
severely clash with E2 if superposed on the E2c structure in the
same manner because its epitope is buried by the E2 β-sandwich
(24, 42). The ability of mAb 8 to neutralize some viruses, albeit
weakly, suggests that major conformational rearrangements at
AS434 are possible that would allow mAb 8 to bind without a
clash. Such conformational flexibility of AS434 is now supported
by the HDX findings. AS434 rearrangement would entail a
nearly 180° rotation of the AS434 helix, and would possibly re-
quire disulfide bonds that link the front layer with the rest of the
E2 core to adopt alternate, extended disulfide conformations.
For example, alternating conformations of a disulfide linking the
I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 domains of β2 integrin are able to accom-
modate a remarkable >20-Å hinge motion between the domains
(43, 44). Considering the poor neutralizing ability of mAb 8, the
alternative AS434 conformation that is recognized by mAb 8
might not be optimal for vaccine design.
Mapping the Conformational Flexibility of E2 by MD Simulations. The
HDX and EM experiments provided empirical evidence for
flexibility at the CD81bs of E2. To assess the flexibility of the
CD81bs further, we performed MD analysis on unbound E2c
from the published E2c-Fab AR3C crystal structure (14) (Fig.
S7). The Cα root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) over a 100-ns
simulation was used as a measure of the flexibility. Consistent
with the HDX study, MD indicated that the front layer was one
of the most flexible regions of E2c (Figs. S5 and S7A). Within the
front layer, regions of high flexibility include residues 420–423,
431–434, and 448–452, each with an average 2.7-Å RMSF (Fig.
S7C), which is threefold higher than the 0.9-Å RMSF observed
for the β-sandwich. Overall, the unliganded E2 front layer
appeared to prefer conformations that drift away from the central
β-sandwich of the E2 protein, with a 5- to 6-Å RMSD relative to
the antibody-bound conformation (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the
most populated cluster of conformations adopted by the front layer
is characterized by an extended conformation of the AS434 helical
region, in which loops extending from the helix deviate 7–8 Å
from the bNAb-bound conformation in the crystal structure
(Fig. S7). This conformational difference is surprising because the
Cys452–Cys620 disulfide bond staples the nearby C terminus of the
front layer to the more stable back layer. However, the MD results
revealed that this disulfide bond appears to accommodate the
conformational differences by potentially adopting alternate
orientations (Fig. S7E), as previously observed for the integrin
subunits discussed above (43, 44). Together with the HDX data,
the MD findings further support the conclusion that the front
layer is conformationally flexible.
Thermal Stability of HCV E2. The observed high conformational
flexibility of recombinant E2 suggests that E2 might be a rela-
tively unstable protein, which could be detrimental for vaccine
development. To assess the global thermal stability of E2, we
first analyzed E2ΔTM using DSC (Fig. 3A). Unexpectedly, the
DSC profile of E2ΔTM displayed a single unfolding peak with a
high thermal denaturation midpoint (Tm) of 84.8 °C, comparable
to the DSC profiles of proteins from thermophilic organisms
(45), which generally display Tm values above 80 °C. Furthermore,
the E2ΔTM Tm is substantially higher than other viral envelope
proteins, such as HIV-1 gp140 (68.1 °C) (46) and influenza hem-
agglutinin (67.9 °C) (47). However, the DSC unfolding peak of
E2ΔTM is relatively broad, with a transition width (ΔT1/2) of
10.6 °C, which is nearly twice the ΔT1/2 of HIV-1 gp140 (46, 48). A
broad ΔT1/2 may be indicative of a multistep, noncooperative
unfolding transition, suggesting the protein may contain different
domains that unfold independently (49, 50). Next, to determine
the influence of the C-terminal stalk region and the N-terminal
HVR1 on the stability of E2, we analyzed the E2c construct that
lacks these components. As suggested by the HDX analysis above,
lack of the stalk and HVR1 had only a modest effect on the
Fig. 3.

 stability of E2c, which has a Tm of 81.5 °C. However, the unfolding
peak of E2c remained broad, with a ΔT1/2 of 10.0 °C, indicating
that this construct still displayed a noncooperative unfolding
behavior.
We next investigated how the flexible, surface-accessible re-
gions that are poorly defined in the electron density in the E2c
crystal structure might affect the melting profile of E2. Thus, we
modified the E2c construct to E2c3 by truncating loops at res-
idues 569–581 and 585–597, which overlap VR3 and the fol-
lowing disordered region. The removal of these loops from E2c
did not affect protein expression and purification, although
E2c3 had a lower Tm of 75.7 °C, nearly twice the difference in
Tm between E2c and E2ΔTM, but with a similar ΔT1/2 (11.2 °C).
This finding indicated that truncation of a flexible and variable
region between the β-sandwich and back layer had a destabi-
lizing effect on E2, but did not result in a more cooperative
melting curve.
Lastly, to study the contribution of the front layer to the
overall thermal stability of E2, we generated an E2c construct
lacking the front layer (E2cΔFL). The E2cΔFL had a Tm of 77.9 °C,
suggesting it is less stable than E2c, but surprisingly more stable
than E2c3. The result implies that E2 thermal stability is more
tolerant of a front layer deletion than truncation of the flexible
VR3 region defined previously (14). A recent crystal structure of
E2cΔFL from a genotype 2a HCV further supports a relatively
minimal role of the E2 front layer in overall E2 stability (41).
Thus, despite the flanking disulfide bridges to the β-sandwich and
back layer, the front layer might be more akin to a flexible loop
than a rigid structural element stably integrated with the rest of
the E2 protein.
Thermodynamic Parameters of HCV E2 Interactions with Ligands. The
change in entropy during protein binding, −TΔS, can be an in-
dication of structural ordering induced by ligand binding. For
example, with interactions between HIV-1 gp120 monomer and
CD4 (and similar ligands), high and unfavorable −TΔS corre-
lates with the induction of structural rearrangement (51). Here,
we used ITC to measure the −TΔS of binding to HCV E2ΔTM
by the CD81bs-targeting ligands bNAbs AR3C, AP33, and
HCV1 and by the large external loop of CD81 (Fig. 3B and Fig.
S8). For comparison, we also measured binding to E2ΔTM by a
non-CD81bs–directed ligand mAb, AR1B.
The ITC results indicated that all ligands tested bound tightly to
E2ΔTM. The −TΔS of the CD81bs-targeting AR3C (2.79 kcal/mol)
and CD81 (−0.44 kcal/mol) was modest. However, the −TΔS of
AR3C and CD81 did not notably differ from the −TΔS of the
non–CD81bs-directed antibodies AR2A (1.25 kcal/mol) and
AR1B (3.43 kcal/mol). By contrast, the −TΔS of AS412 tar-
geting bNAbs AP33 (6.26 kcal/mol) and HCV1 (5.44 kcal/mol)
was nearly twofold higher than for AR3C, suggesting more sta-
bilization on binding to the 12-residue AS412 than the other
CD81bs components. In comparison to the high −TΔS observed
for CD4 binding to gp120 (55 kcal/mol) (51), it appears that
CD81bs recognition does not entail large, global conformational
changes in E2.
Conclusion
Our investigations of E2 antigens by EM, HDX, and MD have
shown that the CD81bs exhibits high structural flexibility. Our
results extend and confirm previous observations and specula-
tions made from crystal structures showing that the AS412 region
is disordered when unbound (14, 41) and adopts a hairpin or
open-loop conformation when complexed with different NAbs
(17–22). Such alternate conformations appear to be critical for
virus neutralization. A recent study by Sandomenico et al. (52)
showed that antibodies raised against cyclized AS412 peptides
that adopt an alternative conformation were not neutralizing.
From the present study, the CD81bs front layer resembles a
highly flexible loop despite being held by two disulfide bonds and
despite high sequence conservation, which is generally not as-
sociated with flexible loops in viral proteins. High flexibility is
consistent with the observation that soluble E2 and E1E2 can
elicit antibodies that can bind the CD81bs with high affinity but,
nonetheless, cannot neutralize the virus (27–31). Some of these
non-NAbs or weak NAbs could be similar to mAb 8, which rec-
ognizes a conformation likely to be poorly accessible on the virus
(Fig. S6). By mapping E2 conformational dynamics, the data here
provide a molecular explanation for why it is difficult to elicit
CD81bs NAbs to the virus using recombinant E2. In contrast to
HIV, which has a recessed CD4 receptor-binding site, the CD81bs
on HCV is fully accessible (Fig. S1), and yet NAbs to CD81bs are
difficult to elicit because of conformational flexibility. In-
terestingly, the DSC findings indicated that although E2 is flexible,
it is also thermally stable, at least in its core region, presumably
due to its high density of disulfide bonds. It appears that in E2,
HCV has evolved a highly stable β-sandwich scaffold stabilized by
conserved disulfide bonds to accommodate both sequence varia-
tion and conformational flexibility. Of note, the observations made
with the soluble E2 antigens may differ in the context of E2 on the
viral surface. Nonetheless, next-generation soluble E2 antigens
with a more stabilized CD81bs that is in a functional conformation
recognized by NAbs may now be engineered based on these E2
flexibility results and published structures. Indeed, antigen stabi-
lization as a rational vaccine design strategy to enhance NAb
production has been demonstrated for respiratory syncytial virus
(53), and is being actively pursued for HIV (54, 55). Further work
in determining E2 CD81bs flexibility on the E1E2 complex and
the virion is warranted to improve immunogen design targeting
this important conserved functional site on HCV.
Materials and Methods
Antibodies. Fabs were either generated from papain (Sigma) digestion of the
corresponding IgGs or expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21 strain; Novagen) as
described previously (14).
E2 Proteins. The four soluble E2 constructs in this study were E2ΔTM, E2c2,
E2c3, and E2cΔFL (Fig. S2). The constructs were produced in 293F cells in the
presence of kifunesine.
HDX. Protein complexes analyzed by HDX were introduced to an Orbitrap
Elite Mass Spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) for electrospray ionization
and accurate mass measurements. DXMS Explorer (Sierra Analytics) was used
for the calculation of the deuteration level of all of the peptides as described
previously (56, 57).
ITC. ITC binding experiments were performed using a MicroCal Auto-iTC200
instrument (GE Healthcare).
DSC. Thermal melting curves of fully glycosylated HCV E2 glycoproteins were
obtained with a MicroCal VP-Capillary calorimeter (Malvern).
EM. Size exclusion chromatography-purified, EndoH-treated E2/Fab com-
plexes were imaged on an FEI Tecnai F20 instrument at 200 kV transmission
electron microscope (TEM) equipped with a Gatan Ultrascan 4k × 4k CCD.
Data were collected using Leginon Multi-Scale Imaging and processed with
TiltPicker (58), Xmipp (59), SPIDER (60), and EMAN1 (61).
MD Simulations. MD simulations were performed using the Desmond MD
package with the Maestro–Desmond interoperability tool, version 2.0 (62).
Further details of materials and methods used in this study are provided in
SI Materials and Methods.
