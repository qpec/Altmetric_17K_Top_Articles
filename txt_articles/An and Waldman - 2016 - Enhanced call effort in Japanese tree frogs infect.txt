Some amphibians have evolved resistance to the devastating disease chytridio-
mycosis, associated with global population declines, but immune defences
can be costly. We recorded advertisement calls of male Japanese tree frogs
(Hyla japonica) in the field. We then assessed whether individuals were infected
by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the causal agent of the disease. This
allowed us to analyse call properties of males as a function of their infection
status. Infected males called more rapidly and produced longer calls than unin-
fected males. This enhanced call effort may reflect pathogen manipulation of
host behaviour to foster disease transmission. Alternatively, increased calling
may have resulted from selection on infected males to reproduce earlier because
of their shortened expected lifespan. Our results raise the possibility that
sublethal effects of Bd alter amphibian life histories, which contributes to
long-term population declines.
1. Introduction
The pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (denoted Bd)
causes chytridiomycosis, a pandemic disease that can kill its amphibian hosts.
The pathogen induces physiological changes in susceptible amphibians through
multiple pathways. Bd interferes with electrolyte balance and osmoregulation
[1,2], effectively causing heart failure in clinically affected individuals. Addition-
ally, Bd disrupts adaptive immune system responses, impairing the proliferation
of lymphocytes and inducing apoptosis [3]. Although Bd antigens are recog-
nized, the fungus subverts normal immune responses against it. Bd factors
affect many tissues, not just those of the lymphoid system, resulting in lethargy,
lack of coordination and other behavioural changes [2,4].
Parasites and pathogens impose costs on hosts that can range from mild to
severe. Amphibians have robust immune systems that can clear many infections,
presumably by diverting resources from growth and reproduction [5]. Adap-
tations to tolerate rather than eliminate infection likewise incur costs [6].
Infections activate physiological and behavioural responses of hosts that promote
recovery from infection, but pathogens can manipulate these responses to facilitate
their own transmission. For example, pathogens sometimes chemically induce
their hosts to suppress signs of illness and boost their reproductive efforts [7].
Chytridiomycosishascontributedtoglobalamphibianpopulationdeclines,dec-
imating populations of some species, sometimes to extinction [8]. Yet, other species,
despite themselves harbouring Bd infections, survive in the midst of epizootics
affecting amphibian communities. In Asia, enzootic Bd strains commonly are
found on amphibians, but hosts typically bear low infection burdens [9]. Asian Bd
strains may have had a long historical association with amphibian hosts [10]. Evol-
utionary responses to the pathogen may be evident in the differential expression of
immune genes by frogs resistant to Bd infection [11]. Nonetheless, Bd might inflict
sublethal damage on its hosts, even in the absence of clinical signs of disease.
Bioacoustic signalling is the primary mode of mate attraction in anurans, so
changes in calling behaviour are likely to result in differential reproductive

 success. To examine how Bd affects Japanese tree frogs (Hyla
japonica) in the wild, we analysed properties of males’ adver-
tisement calls as a function of their Bd infection status. Hyla
japonica is widely distributed in Japan, Korea and eastern
and central Asia, and Bd infection prevalence ranges between
10 and 20% in Korean populations [9]. Neither morbidity nor
mortality attributable to chytridiomycosis has been reported
in this species, suggesting that it is resistant to, or tolerant
of, the pathogen.
2. Material and methods
We recorded advertisement vocalizations of 59 male H. japonica
in rice paddies in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea
(37838015.100 N, 127813013.600 E) between 22.00 and midnight
throughout their breeding season, from early June to mid-
August 2011. We recorded 10 calls from each frog on each of
several nights. Recordings were made 20 cm above frogs’ calling
perches using a Sennheiser ME80 microphone (K3-U power
module) with a Marantz PMD661 recorder at 48 kHz. After
recording each frog for the first time, we measured its snout–
vent length, toe-clipped it for individual identification, and
swabbed its ventral skin, limbs and toes 25 times for analyses
of Bd infection (MW100 swabs, Medical Wire and Equipment,
Corsham, Wiltshire, UK) [12]. After every recording, we also
obtained the temperature and relative humidity at the frog’s call-
ing perch. Air rather than water temperature was measured as
males called on the ground or from vegetation.
Hyla japonica advertisement vocalizations consist of bouts
of calls, each composed of a train of notes that includes multiple
pulses. We analysed 10 call parameters using RAVEN v. 1.4 (Cor-
nell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA): number of
pulses per note (PN), pulse repetition rate (PRR), inter-pulse
interval (IPI), number of notes (NN), note duration (ND), note
repetition rate (NRR), rise time (RT), fall time (FT), call duration
(CD) and dominant frequency (DF) (figure 1). To control for
unequal numbers of pulses and notes, means of these parameters
were first determined for each call. Hyla japonica typically calls in
dense, loud choruses, so only those recordings in which individ-
ual calls could be clearly identified were used. This reduced our
sample size to 42 calling males.
We analysed each call parameter as the dependent variable in
separate repeated-measures general linear models with Bd infec-
tion status as a fixed factor together with snout–vent length,
temperature, relative humidity and their interactions. To confirm
results, when call parameters were significantly affected by
temperature and snout–vent length, their values were adjusted
to the mean temperature of 21.48C or mean snout–vent length
of 39.4 mm by interpolation using regression coefficients. Statisti-
cal analyses were run using the SAS MIXED and TTEST
procedures (SAS v. 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
DNA was extracted from swabs using 50 ml PrepMan Ultra
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and tested for Bd
infection using nested PCR targeting 5.8S rDNA of the pathogen
[13]. Samples were run in duplicate, with Bd DNA as a positive
control, and were considered as positive for Bd infection when an
amplified band of approximately 300 bp was visualized by ethi-
dium bromide staining. Bd infection intensity subsequently was
determined in positive samples by qPCR [12].
3. Results
Infected males were found throughout thebreedingseason,with
9 of 42 males testing Bd-positive. They were slightly, but not
significantly, larger than uninfected males (40.17+0.74 versus
39.24+0.51 mm; x
¯ +s.e.) (t39 ¼ 0.88, p ¼ 0.38, two-tailed).
Infection loads varied between 15 and 43 zoospore genomic
equivalents, similar to those found in other Korean H. japonica
populations [9].
Calls of Bd-infected males contained more PN (F1,242 ¼
16.73, p , 0.0001), longer ND (F1,242 ¼ 15.97, p , 0.0001) and
longer RT (F1,242 ¼ 13.74, p ¼ 0.0003) than those of uninfected
frogs (figure 2). They also tended to have more notes and
longer call duration but these parameters were highly variable
so did not significantly differ between groups (NN, F1,242 ¼
0.42, p ¼ 0.51; CD, F1,242 ¼ 0.91, p ¼ 0.34). Mirroring their
shorter notes, uninfected frogs repeated notes more frequently
than infected ones (NRR, F1,242 ¼ 21.40, p , 0.0001; figure 2).
Dominant frequency did not differ between infected and unin-
fected frogs (DF, F1,242 ¼ 0.00, p ¼ 0.95). Also, no differences
were apparent in PRR, IPI or FT (F1,242 ¼ 0.01, p ¼ 0.92;
F1,242 ¼ 0.01, p ¼ 0.94; F1,242 ¼ 1.96, p ¼ 0.16; respectively).
Overall, the results suggest, controlling for body size, that
infected frogs exerted more calling effort than uninfected,
presumably healthier frogs. Aside from Bd infection status,
note and pulse repetition rates increased with temperature

p ¼ 0.02). Significant interaction effects between body size
and infection status on call properties (PN: F1,242 ¼ 8.61,
p ¼ 0.004; NN: F1,242 ¼ 7.59, p ¼ 0.006; CD: F1,242 ¼ 6.58,
p ¼ 0.01) suggest that larger individuals were more likely
than smaller ones to change their call structure when they
become infected.
4. Discussion
Males infected by Bd appeared to invest more in calling
behaviour than their uninfected competitors. As female anur-
ans generally prefer males that produce longer calls with
higher call rates [14], infected males thus should benefit
from increased reproductive success, at least over the short
term. Immunological responses to parasites and pathogens
impose metabolic costs on hosts that decrease resources avail-
able for other physiological activities. Calling is energetically
expensive [15], and thus, infected males might be expected to
produce fewer or weaker calls. For example, the calling rate of
Hypsiboas prasinus tree frogs decreases as their helminth para-
site load increases [16]. Yet, paradoxically, male H. japonica
not only compensate for any costs of infection but also
increase their reproductive effort.
Although we never have observed H. japonica showing
clinical signs of chytridiomycosis, infected individuals are
not uncommon in populations [9]. Possibly, frogs, when they
are infected, suffer sublethal effects that result in earlier repro-
ductive senescence. In such circumstances, infected frogs might
be selected to increase calling effort at the expense of growth,
survival or other life-history traits to ensure reproductive
success [17]. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated
that testes of Bd-infected frogs are larger and contain more
sperm than those of uninfected controls [18]. Furthermore,
Bd-infected males, when in good condition, are more likely
than uninfected males to be callers [19].
Chytridiomycosis is a highly infectious disease that can
be socially transmitted [20]. Males that invest more effort in
calling might increase their vulnerability to infection owing
to their increased social contacts. If infected males call
more, they may attract more females that consequently
become infected by Bd. Infection risk may be further heigh-
tened during mating, as hormonal changes can induce
temporary immunosuppression [21]. While social contact
seems unlikely to be the primary mode by which the disease
spreads [19], H. japonica is a largely terrestrial species so
females are unlikely to be exposed to Bd zoospores in stand-
ing water except when ovipositing. Whether Bd directly acts
on hosts to increase calling behaviour, thereby effectively
promoting its own spread, requires further study.
Although chytridiomycosis is believed to be a principal
driver of worldwide amphibian population declines, mass
mortality events have been reported in limited geographical
regions [8]. Rather, population declines often occur gradually,
perhaps in response to environmental changes that increase
pathogen effects. Estimates of anuran population sizes typi-
cally are based on call surveys [22] but these might not
reliably indicate population health. As frogs call to attract
mates, enhanced call effort should immediately increase
infected males’ reproductive success, yet negatively affect
population viability over the longer term.
Korean frogs are unlikely to be naive to Bd. Recent
research suggests that Bd has been infecting amphibians in
Korea for at least the last century [10], sufficient time for
endemic Bd to evolve into numerous strains [9]. Over time,
frogs presumably have adjusted their life-history strategies
to compensate for effects of the pathogen. Achieving higher
reproductive success when infected presumably comes at
the cost of future survival or reproduction. The enhanced
calling effort demonstrated by infected individuals represents
only one component of the evolutionary response of amphi-
bians to the pathogenic fungus. Long-term field studies of
effects of Bd on amphibian life histories and population
dynamics are needed to fully understand the threat that the
pathogen poses to its amphibian hosts.
