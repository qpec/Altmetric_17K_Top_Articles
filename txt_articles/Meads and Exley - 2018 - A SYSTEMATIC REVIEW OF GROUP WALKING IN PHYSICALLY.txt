Abstract: 
Background  
Walking is a good way to meet physical activity guidelines. We examined 
the effectiveness of walking in groups compared to walking alone or 
inactive controls in physically healthy adults on physical activity and quality 
of life. (PROSPERO CRD42016033752).  
Methods  
We searched Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Knowledge Science Citation 
Index, and Cochrane CENTRAL until March 2016, for any comparative 
studies, in physically healthy adults, of walking in groups compared to 
inactive controls or walking alone, reporting any measure of physical 
activity. We searched references from recent relevant systematic reviews. 
Two reviewers checked study eligibility and independently extracted data. 
Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Quality was assessed 
using likelihood of selection, performance, attrition and detection biases. 
Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3.  
Results  
From 1404 citations, 17 studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 
10 in meta-analyses. Thirteen compared group walking to inactive controls 
and four to walking alone. Eight reported more than one measure of 
physical activity, none reported according to current guidelines. Group 
walking compared to inactive controls increased follow-up physical activity 
(9 RCTs, SMD 0.58 (95%CI 0.34-0.82) to SMD 0.43 (95%CI 0.20-0.66)). 
Compared to walking alone, studies were too few and too heterogeneous to 
conduct meta-analysis, but the trend was improved physical activity at 
follow up for group walking participants. Six (all inactive control) reported 
quality-of-life: four showed statistically significantly improved scores.    
Discussion  
Better evidence may encourage government policy to promote walking in 
groups. Standardised physical activity outcomes need to be reported in 
research.

Background 
Walking is a good way to meet physical activity guidelines. We examined the effectiveness 
of walking in groups compared to walking alone or inactive controls in physically healthy 
adults on physical activity and quality of life. (PROSPERO CRD42016033752). 
Methods 
We searched Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Knowledge Science Citation Index, and 
Cochrane CENTRAL until March 2016, for any comparative studies, in physically healthy 
adults, of walking in groups compared to inactive controls or walking alone, reporting any 
measure of physical activity. We searched references from recent relevant systematic 
reviews. Two reviewers checked study eligibility and independently extracted data. 
Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Quality was assessed using likelihood of 
selection, performance, attrition and detection biases. Meta-analysis was conducted using 
Review Manager 5.3.  
Results 
From 1404 citations, 18 studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 10 in meta-
analyses. Fourteen compared group walking to inactive controls and four to walking alone. 
Eight reported more than one measure of physical activity, none reported according to 
current guidelines. Group walking compared to inactive controls increased follow-up physical 
activity (9 RCTs, SMD 0.58 (95%CI 0.34-0.82) to SMD 0.43 (95%CI 0.20-0.66)). Compared 
to walking alone, studies were too few and too heterogeneous to conduct meta-analysis, but 
the trend was improved physical activity at follow up for group walking participants. Seven 
(all inactive control) reported quality-of-life: five showed statistically significantly improved 
scores.   
Discussion  
Better evidence may encourage government policy to promote walking in groups. 
Standardised physical activity outcomes need to be reported in research.

What is already known on this subject? 
The majority of people are aware that they should be more physically active but it is difficult 
to motivate people. Much effort has been expended by clinical public health and others to 
encourage people to undertake more physical activity. Walking is an excellent mode of 
physical activity and more may take part if the social side of walking in groups was 
promoted.  
What this study adds? 
This systematic review demonstrates that walking in groups is more effective than inactivity 
to increase physical activity in physically healthy people. Far less evidence is available on 
walking in groups compared to walking alone but the trend was improved physical activity at 
follow up for participants walking in groups.

Background  
The World Health Organisation physical activity strategy recommends that adults undertake 
150 minutes of moderate aerobic physical activity such as cycling or fast walking (3-5 miles 
per hour) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity or a mix of moderate and vigorous activity every 
week, plus muscle-strengthening exercises on two or more days per week that work all of 
the major muscles in the body (1;2). However, only a relatively small proportion of adults 
meet these guidelines. In the USA, in 2014, 49.2% adults met the physical activity guidelines 
for aerobic physical activity and 20.8% adults met the physical activity guidelines for both 
aerobic physical and muscle-strengthening activity (3). The equivalent proportions meeting 
the physical activity guidelines for aerobic physical activity are: 24% of men and 21% of 
women in Canada (4), 40% of adults in Australia(5), and 67% of men and 55% of women in 
the UK(6).  
Dropout rates for exercise initiatives are known to be high (7;8). However, there is good 
evidence that exercise adherence is enhanced through the use of social support (9;10). A 
recent mixed-methods systematic review on community-based group exercise interventions 
for older adults found that increased social connectedness, wellbeing gains and an 
empowering environment were themes associated with above average long-term adherence 
rate (11). This study concluded that incorporating participants’ views into exercise 
programme designs could provide guidance for innovative interventions, which would lead to 
sustained adherence.  
Walking is a highly accessible form of physical activity, and is associated with a range of 
positive health benefits (12;13). Governments have strongly encouraged the public to 
increase physical activity through walking. For example the UK government aimed to invest 
£7 million between 2008 and 2011 in a programme of innovative campaigns to encourage 
people to walk more(14;15), and the US Department of Health and Human Services 
advocates walking as the principle component of its Active Living (16;17) initiative (one of 
seven priorities in the National Prevention Strategy) (18). And, as mentioned above, the 
World Health Organization physical activity recommendations include walking.  
There have been three recent systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of walking 
groups to enhance health (19) and increase physical activity (20;21) They included 42 
studies (19), 19 studies (20) and 10 studies (in the led walks section) (21) and all have 
strengths and weaknesses. For example, two (19;20) included both randomised and non-
randomised studies but the other (21) included RCTs only. All three included studies with 
physically and/or mentally healthy participants and studies with participants with a variety of

physical conditions that may impede walking (such as knee osteoarthritis), and did not meta-
analyse results for different participant groups separately. Also studies included in earlier 
systematic reviews were not included in later systematic reviews. One (20) included more 
than one effect size estimate per study, thus double counting results from some participants. 
One (21) did not conduct meta-analyses and one (19) had a physical functioning (6 minute 
walk test) meta-analysis of two included studies in non-healthy patients. None of the reviews 
looked at the specific impact that being part of a group had on adherence to the intervention. 
This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness in physically healthy adults of walking in 
groups compared to inactive controls and/or individuals walking alone, focusing on any 
measure of physical activity or quality of life at follow up. By also including walking alone as 
a comparison group we examine whether being part of a group is more likely to lead to 
greater benefits than walking alone.

Methods 
We developed and registered a protocol for this systematic review (Prospero registration 
number CRD 42016033752). The pre-defined inclusion criteria were comparative group 
studies in any language with physically healthy adults taking part in led walks or community 
group walks with an aspect of social interaction in addition to walking. We defined physically 
healthy as free from reported physical conditions or pain that would impede walking. We 
accepted a maximum of 20% in any group with pre-existing physical conditions so as not to 
exclude useful information, because many participants were likely to be older and not all 
would be completely physically healthy. Any forms of walking groups were compared to 
either (a) standard care, waiting list or any other non-active interventions such as physical 
activity advice or lectures on diet or nutrition (Set 1), or (b) walking alone (Set 2). Outcomes 
of interest were any measure of physical activity at follow up and/or any measure of generic 
quality of life or wellbeing. Outcomes could be measured at any time at or after the end of 
the intervention.  
The following databases were searched between 2010 and March 2016: Medline, Embase, 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central and 
Web of Science, Science Citation Index. Search terms included walk*, groups, program*, 
club, community, healthy, physical activity and exercise. Both MESH terms and keywords 
were used (see Supplementary Table 1). Search terms were piloted to ensure that searches 
were sufficiently sensitive to find known includeable studies. Reference lists of included 
studies and systematic reviews (19-21) were checked for includeable studies. Since there 
had been three relevant published systematic reviews with very comprehensive searches, 
with dates up to 2011-12, our searches were started in 2010 in order to ensure no studies 
were missed during the overlapping period. All relevant titles and abstracts were transferred 
to Endnote for assessment. 
Two reviewers (CM and JE) checked study eligibility independently. Both also independently 
extracted data from studies into standardised, pre-designed extraction tables in Microsoft 
Word. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Quality of included studies was 
assessed using likelihood of selection, performance, attrition and detection criteria because 
of the variety of study designs included. Specific quality checklists evaluate these biases 
tailored to different study designs and as we had a variety of study designs included, going 
back to fundamental quality assessment was considered to be more useful than using a 
mixture of different checklists. We tabulated the characteristics and results of all the included 
studies; analysis was quantitative. Numerical results were presented as point estimates of 
effect sizes (means, medians) with any reported measures of spread (standard deviations,

standard errors, ranges, confidence intervals). Where standard errors, ranges or 95% 
confidence intervals (95%CI) were provided, standard deviations were calculated using 
standard formulae from the Cochrane Handbook (22). Review Manager (version 5.3, The 
Cochrane Library) was used for meta-analyses. Where medians and ranges were given, 
these were only converted into means and SDs if the ranges were not skewed. We used 
random effects models because of heterogeneity of participants, interventions and outcome 
measures of physical activity. Where categorical measures were reported, meta-analyses 
used odds ratios (OR). Most outcomes, however, were continuous measures, and we used 
standardised mean differences (SMD) as outcomes had differing measurement scales. In 
one of the continuous outcome measures, a lower score was a better result (time taken to 
walk one mile) so these results were reversed for the meta-analysis. Several of the studies 
had more than one measure of physical activity, so we conducted two continuous measures 
meta-analyses, one using the lowest values (smallest effect size) and one using the highest 
values (largest effect size). Where only one measure of physical activity was reported this is 
used in both meta-analyses. There was insufficient evidence to warrant further investigation 
of heterogeneity by meta-regression. Risk of publication bias was assessed using a funnel 
plot.  
Role of the funding source 
There was no funding source for this study. The corresponding author had full access to all 
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

Results 
Searches found 1404 titles and abstracts. After removing duplicates 1047 remained for 
screening, of which 1000 were excluded. Full papers for 79 articles were assessed for 
inclusion (47 from database searches and 32 from reference lists) (see Supplementary 
Figure 1). For a full list of excluded studies and reasons for exclusion, see Supplementary 
Table 2. There were 18 studies included in the qualitative synthesis, fourteen used an 
inactive control (Set 1) (23-36) and four compared group walking interventions to walking 
alone (Set 2) (37-40). One study from Set 1 (30) had a second publication reporting long-
term follow up (41).  There were 10 studies from Set 1 in the quantitative syntheses (meta-
analyses). It is possible that there might be an effect from publication bias suggesting that 
small trials with no significant effects have not been published, or their physical activity 
results not published (see Supplementary Figure 2). 
Characteristics of included studies are presented in Supplementary Table 3. The majority of 
studies (14 out of 18) were RCTs or cluster RCTs; there was also one non-randomised 
experimental study (36), two case-control (38;39) and one cohort study with a local 
population comparator (29). The number of participants in studies varied between 17 and 
605 participants; seven of the studies had fewer than 50 participants. Most studies included 
older participants (older than 65 years) but participants’ ages ranged from 18 to 91 years. 
Participants were community volunteers in eight studies (23;24;26;32-34;36;37), recruitment 
was via general practices or community centres in six studies (25;27;31;35;38;40), from 
specific housing areas in two studies (29;39) and from random population sampling in one 
study (28). In the remaining study the recruitment method was unclear (30). The 
interventions were all led walks or walking in groups. In some studies the intervention 
consisted of encouraging participants to walk in a group, facilitated by advertising locally and 
training an individual to lead the walks, in others the intervention entailed leading the group 
in the walks. Interventions studied lasted between five and 90 minutes on one to seven days 
per week, for between eight weeks and one year. The frequency and duration of walking 
was tailored to the ages of the sample participants.  
The comparators in Set 1 were usual activities, cancer screening, fitness testing, advice, 
educational lectures, no walking group encouragement, waiting list, no intervention routine 
care or unspecified inactive controls. The comparators in Set 2 were usual care with 
encouragement to walk but no access within the study to a walking group (27;28), being a 
former walking club member but still walking (39), and not being paired with a ‘buddy’ to walk 
with (40). Follow-up was at the end of the intervention only for most of the studies, three 
studies had additional follow ups at between 3 months and 10 years (23;27;30). One case

control study (39) had no follow-up as the comparator was retrospective. Outcomes 
measured were of a wide variety of categorical and continuous physical activity measures; 
no study used the same physical activity measure.  
Quality of included studies varied (see Supplementary Table 4); nine studies were classified 
as being at high risk of bias, five medium and four low risk of bias. A number of the studies 
gave insufficient details to assess all aspects of quality so classification may not be accurate. 
An intervention such as this cannot be blinded to the participant, but blinding of investigators 
and outcome assessment should have been possible but it was not apparent whether this 
had been done in the majority of the studies (24-26;28;33-35;36;38-40). For the cluster 
RCTs, in Thomas et al 2012 (40) it was clear that participants knew they were part of a trial 
whereas in Fisher et al 2004 (24) and Jancey et al 2008 (28) this was unclear.  
Physical activity outcomes 
Numerical results are shown in Table 1. For Set 1 (inactive controls), meta-analysis of the 
continuous measure of physical activity showed that walking in groups increased physical 
activity at follow up compared to inactive controls (9 RCTs, highest value SMD 0.58 (95%CI 
0.34 to 0.82, I2 = 76%) and lowest value SMD 0.43 (95%CI 0.20 to 0.66, I2 = 73%)) (see 
Figure 1a and 1b). Removing the non-randomised experimental study (Takahashi 2013) 
reduced the SMD from 0.58 (95%CI 0.34 to 0.82) to 0.51 (95%CI 0.28 to 0.74). When the 
two studies that undertook follow up beyond the end of the intervention (22 months and 3.5 
months after participating in intervention) (Isaacs 2007, Kriska 1986) are taken out of the 
lowest value meta-analysis, the SMD increases from 0.43 (95%CI 0.20 to 0.66) to 0.66 
(95%CI 0.30 to 1.02) suggesting that physical activity gains associated with participating in 
walking groups diminished over time. Two studies measured categorical outcomes for 
physical activity. The meta-analysis found that the risk of participants being physically active 
at the end of the intervention was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to 
the comparators (RR 1.44 (95%CI 1.22 to 1.70, I2 = 0%)) (Supplementary Figure 3). 
For Set 2 (walking alone controls) studies were too few and too heterogeneous to conduct 
meta-analysis. For Cox 2008, there was no difference in 1.6km walk time between 
intervention and control groups at both 6 months and 1 year follow-ups. In Lee 2011, 
exercise frequency and duration were statistically significantly improved for the intervention 
group compared to controls at the end of the intervention (12 weeks). For Nguyen 2002 (39), 
there was a higher percentage of participants walking 1 km or less in the intervention group 
compared to the controls. In Thomas 2012 (40), those receiving the buddy intervention had 
higher mean physical activity levels at 12 months than controls, although the numerical

results for the control group were not explicitly reported.  
Quality of life outcomes 
Seven of the Set 1 and none of the Set 2 studies measured quality of life and wellbeing (see 
Table 2). Studies used a variety of measures for quality of life and wellbeing including 
Euroqol EQ-5D, Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), SF-36 and SF-12. All scores except NHP 
had higher scores indicating better quality of life. For NHP higher scores indicated greater 
number and severity of problems.  In five of the seven studies (24-26,32;33), the walking 
group intervention groups showed statistically significantly improved scores compared to 
controls in at least one of the outcomes measured. In the remaining two studies (27;35) 
there were no significant differences found, including in NHP scores. None of the outcomes 
measured showed significantly worse quality of life or wellbeing for the walking group 
interventions compared to controls. 
Other outcomes 
Retention rates are shown in Supplementary Table 4 and include retention rates for all 
participants, or retention rates by group where reported. Ten of the studies reported 
retention rates separately for the intervention groups compared to controls (eight in Set 1 
and two in Set 2). Seven had higher rates for the intervention groups whereas three had 
higher rates for the control groups. In several instances the rates were very similar. Many of 
the studies found that retention rates dropped gradually over time. There was insufficient 
information to determine whether different types of control had any impact on retention rates.  
Three studies in Set 1 and no studies in Set 2 reported numerical results for measures of 
social network or sociableness. Jancey 2008 (28) used a categorical measure of ‘Having no 
friends nearby’ in Generalised Estimating Equations and found that it had a significant 
negative effect (p=0.037) on total physical activity times, suggesting that fewer friends 
nearby was correlated with less total physical activity. Krieger 2009 (29) measured the 
number of neighbours the participant knew well enough to say hello to. They reported before 
and after results for the intervention group only and found a significant increase in the mean 
number of neighbours that participants knew well enough to say hello to while walking (4.3 
(95%CI 2.0, 6.7) p=0.001). Maki 2012 (32) measured the Lubben Social Network Scale and 
found that there was no significant difference in mean scores between the intervention and 
control groups (16.3 (SD5.7) versus 16.8 (SD5.2) p=0.16).

Discussion  
Main findings 
The main finding was that physical activity in physically healthy adults improved at follow up 
for the walking group intervention compared to inactive controls. This is based mostly on 
self-report physical activity outcomes and only one study used accelerometry (36) but this 
study was small, with 14 participants in each group. This physical activity improvement was 
strongest immediately following completion of the intervention and reduced somewhat at 
longer follow-ups. Walking in groups tended to increase quality of life measures and may 
increase social connectedness, but the evidence for this was uncertain. There was 
insufficient evidence to indicate whether walking in groups was more effective than walking 
alone for increasing physical activity and no evidence on the impact on quality of life.  
Retention rates tended to be higher in the intervention groups. No included study reported 
the proportion of participants meeting the recommended guidelines for physical activity of 30 
minutes moderate intensity physical activity five times per week (42). In general the quality of 
the evidence found was mixed, with seven out of 13 studies in Set 1 and two out of four 
studies in Set 2 considered to be at high risk of bias.  
Comparison to previous work 
Previous systematic reviews found that walking groups, compared to a variety of active and 
inactive controls provided wide-ranging health benefits (19) and that they were effective in 
increasing physical activity (20), including for leisure and travel (21). However, this is the first 
systematic review to quantify this effect in physically healthy people compared to inactive 
controls through meta-analyses. Also, this is the first systematic review to attempt to 
compare the sociable side of walking in groups to people walking alone.  
Strengths and limitations  
This systematic review has several strengths in that it is both more comprehensive than 
previous systematic reviews as it included adult participants of any ages, and more focussed 
as it only included mainly physically healthy participants, rather than mixing participants with 
conditions likely to impede the ability to walk such as knee arthritis with participants without 
such difficulties. In the included studies, participants varied but were mostly older adults, 
particularly older women and it is women in the age group of 55 to 74 year olds that form the 
majority of walkers in walking groups (43). As many participants were older, not all will be 
completely physically healthy, so a pragmatic decision was made to limit the proportion of 
physically unhealthy participants in any group to 20% or less, so as not to exclude useful

information. Extensive searches of reference lists from previous systematic reviews, 
included studies and policy documents were made, in addition to database searches, to find 
all eligible studies. All included studies were listed in one or more of the three systematic 
reviews (19-21). It is clear from the fact that the previously published systematic reviews (19-
21) were not comprehensive that searching for these types of studies is not straightforward. 
One reason is that, when searching for studies, the term ‘walking group’ can refer to one arm 
of a comparative study rather than where people were walking in groups. Therefore a 
relatively large number of full texts were read thoroughly to ascertain the exact nature of the 
walking intervention and whether it had any kind of social interaction.  Physical activity 
interventions are difficult to search for via databases alone, for example another systematic 
review of physical activity interventions found twice as many studies via other sources than 
via database searches (44). Also definitions of physical activity, exercise and physical fitness 
can vary so in this paper we use descriptions defined by Caspersen in 1985 (45).  
There were some studies where full papers were unavailable that could have been 
includeable in the systematic review. Every effort was made to use all available data 
including extracting information from existing systematic reviews. The included studies were 
very heterogeneous in terms of participants, interventions, comparators, follow up lengths 
and study designs, so it could be argued that studies should not have been meta-analysed. 
Also, some studies had imbalances at the start of the study, for example the cluster RCT by 
Jancey et al 2008 (28). However, random effects models were used to mitigate these factors 
to some extent, but this gives more weight to smaller studies than fixed effects meta-
analysis. Given that most of the included studies were relatively small this weighting may be 
a strength rather than a weakness. We included any comparative studies rather than RCTs 
only, and it could be argued that the different study designs should not have been meta-
analysed. Also no two physical activity outcomes were the same. Most were by self-report 
which can be inaccurate, few used objective measures and only one used 
accelerometry(36). However, they were all measuring physical activity in some way which 
meant that they could be meta-analysed. This approach assumes that a standard deviation 
change in one physical activity measurement scale is equivalent to a standard deviation 
change on another, which may not be true. Some numerical results were missing which 
meant that not all studies could be entered in the meta-analyses. We had to estimate SD 
from other measures of spread in three studies (26;27;31) but in one other (29) there was no 
measure of spread given so it could not contribute to the meta-analysis result. Because of all 
these factors, we consider our meta-analyses exploratory, and we conducted sensitivity 
analyses by altering the physical activity outcomes entered into the meta-analyses to 
generate highest and lowest effect size estimates.

We did not include the time spent in physical activity in the meta-analyses, although this is 
reported in Tables 1a and 1b. It might be that longer walking duration is a better predictor of 
physical activity outcomes, and this could be established through meta-regression. However, 
we chose not to conduct meta-regression because of the wide variation in physical activity 
outcome measures used in the included studies, and because there were only nine studies 
that could contribute to the calculation. In addition, some of the studies included warming up 
and cooling off, whereas others did not report this. These times are often opportunities for 
social interaction, which would not be captured if duration of exercise was used only. Social 
connectedness outcome measures were not well reported and the measures used not well 
validated.  
Implications for policy 
This systematic review aims to inform public policy on group walking promotion. As high 
levels of moderate intensity physical activity (60 to 75 minutes per day) seem to eliminate 
any increased risk of death associated with lack of physical activity, the more that people 
can be encouraged to undertake physical activity, the better it will be for them, the health 
services and the public purse (46;47). The lack of strong evidence demonstrating that group 
walking participation enhanced physical activity compared to walking alone means that there 
is no strong driver as yet for governments to adopt coherent strategic plans or to invest in 
this area of physical activity behaviour change. Walking in groups is a safe and inexpensive 
intervention that can be delivered easily and successfully in the community and has 
consistency with expectations and the public’s perception of walking.  
Implications for research  
There needs to be further research clearly evaluating the benefits for physically healthy 
people in taking part in group walking compared to walking alone, particularly measuring 
physical activity over the longer term. The activity measure should be that recommended by 
the World Health Organisation, i.e. the proportion meeting the physical activity guidelines. 
Other outcomes should include generic quality of life and wider societal costs. Capturing any 
adverse events is also important. There also needs to be evaluation of the best ways to 
motivate people to continue with walking once the initial enthusiasm wanes and the officially 
organised activity is discontinued. It is possible that sociable aspects of group walking may 
enhance persistence in maintaining physical activity participation.   
There needs to be encouragement to the physical activity research community to 
standardise physical activity measurement (following the COMET initiative (48)), so that all 
studies measure physical activity consistently. This would enable results of various

interventions to be compared across studies.  
 
Conclusions 
The bulk of the empirical evidence base for walking in groups consists of small studies 
comparing this activity to inactive controls and there is good evidence that walking in groups 
is more effective than inactivity. However, there is far less evidence on walking in groups 
compared to walking alone, yet research has shown that exercise adherence is enhanced 
through the use of social support. At a time when we are being encouraged to meet physical 
activity guidelines, a large proportion of the public fail to do so. Better quality evidence may 
encourage government policy to promote walking in groups organised by the groups 
themselves. Adequately powered multi-centre RCTs along with qualitative process 
evaluation should be undertaken to test the efficacy of walking group encouragement 
interventions.

Supplementary Table 1. Search terms and searches 
Searches were conducted in March 2016 for the years 2011-2016 to find relevant studies. 
Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, CAB Abstracts, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science, Science 
Citation Index were searched. Also many relevant studies would have been included in at least 
one of the three recent systematic reviews on walking interventions, so the included and excluded 
studies lists of these reviews were examined, using full texts if necessary to establish whether 
they met our inclusion criteria. The searches for these reviews were dated  
• 
Kassavou SR searches to March 2012 
• 
Hanson SR searches to November 2013 
• 
ScHARR searches not given but presumed to be to end 2011 
 
Medline (OVID) search terms:  
(Walk*) AND (program* or group* or led or scheme* or club* or community-based) AND (Healthy 
Volunteers/ or healthy.mp. or Healthy People Programs/) AND (physical activity or exercise) 
Searches were limited to:  human, all adults, therapy (maximises sensitivity)
