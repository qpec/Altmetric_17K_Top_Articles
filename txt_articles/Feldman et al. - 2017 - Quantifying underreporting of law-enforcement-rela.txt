Abstract
Background
Prior research suggests that United States governmental sources documenting the number
of law-enforcement-related deaths (i.e., fatalities due to injuries inflicted by law enforcement
officers) undercount these incidents. The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), adminis-
tered by the federal government and based on state death certificate data, identifies such
deaths by assigning them diagnostic codes corresponding to “legal intervention” in accor-
dance with the International Classification of Diseases–10th Revision (ICD-10). Newer, non-
governmental databases track law-enforcement-related deaths by compiling news media
reports and provide an opportunity to assess the magnitude and determinants of suspected
NVSS underreporting. Our a priori hypotheses were that underreporting by the NVSS would
exceed that by the news media sources, and that underreporting rates would be higher for
decedents of color versus white, decedents in lower versus higher income counties, dece-
dents killed by non-firearm (e.g., Taser) versus firearm mechanisms, and deaths recorded
by a medical examiner versus coroner.
Methods and findings
We created a new US-wide dataset by matching cases reported in a nongovernmental,
news-media-based dataset produced by the newspaper The Guardian, The Counted, to
identifiable NVSS mortality records for 2015. We conducted 2 main analyses for this
cross-sectional study: (1) an estimate of the total number of deaths and the proportion
unreported by each source using capture–recapture analysis and (2) an assessment of
correlates of underreporting of law-enforcement-related deaths (demographic character-
istics of the decedent, mechanism of death, death investigator type [medical examiner
versus coroner], county median income, and county urbanicity) in the NVSS using

(212-231-7762). Cause-of-death data for
decedents with known names and dates of birth
are available from the National Death Index Plus for
 multilevel logistic regression. We estimated that the total number of law-enforcement-
related deaths in 2015 was 1,166 (95% CI: 1,153, 1,184). There were 599 deaths reported
in The Counted only, 36 reported in the NVSS only, 487 reported in both lists, and an esti-
mated 44 (95% CI: 31, 62) not reported in either source. The NVSS documented 44.9%
(95% CI: 44.2%, 45.4%) of the total number of deaths, and The Counted documented
93.1% (95% CI: 91.7%, 94.2%). In a multivariable mixed-effects logistic model that con-
trolled for all individual- and county-level covariates, decedents injured by non-firearm
mechanisms had higher odds of underreporting in the NVSS than those injured by fire-
arms (odds ratio [OR]: 68.2; 95% CI: 15.7, 297.5; p < 0.01), and underreporting was also
more likely outside of the highest-income-quintile counties (OR for the lowest versus high-
est income quintile: 10.1; 95% CI: 2.4, 42.8; p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant
difference in the odds of underreporting in the NVSS for deaths certified by coroners com-
pared to medical examiners, and the odds of underreporting did not vary by race/ethnicity.
One limitation of our analyses is that we were unable to examine the characteristics of
cases that were unreported in The Counted.
Conclusions
The media-based source, The Counted, reported a considerably higher proportion of law-
enforcement-related deaths than the NVSS, which failed to report a majority of these inci-
dents. For the NVSS, rates of underreporting were higher in lower income counties and for
decedents killed by non-firearm mechanisms. There was no evidence suggesting that
underreporting varied by death investigator type (medical examiner versus coroner) or
race/ethnicity.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Several governmental and nongovernmental databases track the number of law-enforce-
ment-related deaths in the US, but all are likely to undercount these deaths.
• To our knowledge, our study is the first to estimate the proportion of law-enforcement-
related deaths properly captured by 2 data sources: official US mortality data, derived
from death certificates, and The Counted, a nongovernmental database derived from
news media reports.
• US mortality data include virtually all deaths that occur in the country, and law-enforce-
ment-related deaths are supposed to be assigned a diagnostic code corresponding to
“legal intervention.” If a death is improperly assigned another code, it is considered to
be misclassified, which leads to undercounting of the number of law-enforcement-
related deaths. We investigated the extent of misclassification and the factors associated
with misclassification.

 What did the researchers do and find?
• We estimated that 1,166 law-enforcement-related deaths occurred in the US in 2015;
The Counted captured a larger proportion of these deaths than the US mortality data.
• Law-enforcement-related deaths were most likely to be misclassified in mortality data if
the death was not due to a gunshot wound or if it occurred in a low-income county.
What do these findings mean?
• Datasets based on news media reports may offer higher-quality information on law-
enforcement-related deaths than mortality data.
• Further exploration into the ways in which policymakers and public health officials
report law-enforcement-related deaths is warranted.
Introduction
The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), administered by the US government and based
on state death certificates, is the longest-running national data source on law-enforcement-
related deaths (i.e., those involving fatal injuries inflicted by law enforcement), but has long
been suspected of underreporting a large number of such deaths [1–3]. Other databases run by
the US Department of Justice similarly undercount law-enforcement-related deaths [4]. In
recent years, a new type of data source on legal intervention mortality has emerged: national
databases maintained by newspapers, nongovernmental organizations, and the US Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS; a governmental organization) that identify incidents via web searches of
news media reports [3,5–8].
The NVSS has identified law-enforcement-related deaths since 1949, following the inclu-
sion of “injury by intervention of police” as a diagnostic category in the 6th revision to the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) [9]. While the category has since been renamed
as “legal intervention,” its definition remains unchanged up to the current ICD revision, ICD-
10: “injuries inflicted by the police or other law-enforcing agents, including military on duty,
in the course of arresting or attempting to arrest lawbreakers, suppressing disturbances, main-
taining order, and other legal action” [10] (Table 1). A designation of legal intervention does
not depend on whether the use of force resulting in the injury was lawful [11] or whether the
injuries were inflicted intentionally.
Prior studies found that NVSS counts of legal intervention deaths were lower in at least
some US states compared to counts reported by law enforcement data sources, suggesting that
the NVSS misses some proportion of these deaths [1,13,14]. This underreporting occurs when
a death certificate is misclassified: it is wrongly assigned an ICD code that does not correspond
to legal intervention, and the death can therefore not be identified as law-enforcement-related
in queries of NVSS data (Table 1). Misclassification primarily occurs because the coroner or
medical examiner certifying the death fails to mention police involvement in the literal text
fields of the death certificate’s cause of death section (e.g., the field labeled “Describe how the
injury occurred” does not state “killed by police”), although mistakes in the process of assign-
ing ICD codes may still occur even when the death certificate indicates police involvement

 [15]. To our knowledge, there have been no prior national estimates of the misclassification
rate for legal intervention deaths in the NVSS, nor has any research investigated factors associ-
ated with misclassification.
In recent years, a number of nongovernmental initiatives have sought to identify incidents
of law-enforcement-related deaths in the US based on web searches of news media, and these
databases provide counts that far exceed those reported in the NVSS and traditional US
Department of Justice governmental data sources. Examples of such nongovernmental efforts
include The Guardian’s The Counted (covering 2015–2016) [5], The Washington Post’s police
shooting database (2015–present; excludes non-firearm deaths) [7], and Fatal Encounters
(2014–present prospectively; 2000–2013 retrospectively) [6]. Prior analyses have found that,
within the same time period, these sources report a nearly identical set of cases [16]. In addi-
tion to these nongovernmental efforts, the BJS redesigned its Arrest-Related Deaths (ARD)
program in mid-2015 to track deaths in custody using a similar method: ARD first identifies
cases based on a systematic internet search of news media reports, then requests more infor-
mation about deaths from law enforcement agencies, medical examiners, and coroners [8].
Even as researchers have made increasing use of these news-media-based data sources [3,16–
18] and the federal government has adopted their practices, there have been no prior estimates
about the proportion of law-enforcement-related deaths that remain unreported in databases
drawn from news media.
Our a priori hypotheses were that underreporting by the NVSS would exceed that by the
news media sources, and that misclassification rates would be higher for decedents of color
versus white, decedents in lower versus higher income counties, decedents killed by non-fire-
arm versus firearm mechanisms, and deaths recorded by a medical examiner versus coroner.
Our study aims to improve public health monitoring of law-enforcement-related deaths,
which may ultimately aid efforts to improve accountability for both individual deaths and
aggregate trends [18].

“Legal intervention”
Based on the definition from the International
Classification of Diseases–10th Revision (ICD-
10): “injuries inflicted by the police or other law-
enforcing agents, including military on duty, in the
course of arresting or attempting to arrest
lawbreakers, suppressing disturbances,
maintaining order, and other legal action” [10]
Deaths will not appear if they are misclassified, i.e.,
assigned an ICD-10 code that does not correspond
to legal intervention. This may happen because law
enforcement involvement is not mentioned on the
death certificate, or potentially due to coding errors
by the National Center for Health Statistics.
The Counted
“People killed by police and
other law enforcement
agencies in the United States”
From The Counted website: “What is included in
The Counted? Any deaths arising directly from
encounters with law enforcement. This will
inevitably include, but will likely not be limited to,
people who were shot, tasered and struck by
police vehicles as well those who died in police
custody. What is not included in The Counted?
Self-inflicted deaths during encounters with law
enforcement. For instance, a person who died by
crashing his or her vehicle into an oncoming car
while fleeing from police at high speed is not
regarded by the Guardian’s database to have
been killed by law enforcement. The database
does not include suicides or self-inflicted deaths
including drug overdoses in police custody or
detention facilities.” [12]
Deaths may not appear if they were unreported in
news media, or if they were reported but The
Counted staff did not identify these publications.

 Methods
We created a dataset of law-enforcement-related deaths in 2015 by matching 2 sources: The
Counted, a news-media-based dataset created by the newspaper The Guardian [5], and the
NVSS, from which we obtained individually identifiable mortality data for cases that were
reported by The Guardian. Our study was deemed exempt from review by the Harvard T.H.
Chan School of Public Health institutional review board (IRB16-1146) because it did not
involve living persons. We were not able to publish death counts for all US states and counties
due to privacy restrictions for NVSS data. We did not have a written prospective analysis plan;
we agreed on an analytic plan at an October 2016 meeting and conducted all analyses in Janu-
ary 2017. Our cross-sectional study involved 2 main analyses: (1) a capture–recapture analysis
to estimate the total number of law-enforcement-related deaths in the US during 2015, as well
as the proportions captured by The Counted and the NVSS, and (2) a multilevel logistic regres-
sion analysis investigating the correlates of misclassification for law-enforcement-related
deaths in NVSS data. This report has been prepared according to STROBE guidelines, as sug-
gested by the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) net-
work (S1 STROBE checklist).
The Counted identified US law-enforcement-related deaths in 2015–2016 using web
searches of news media reports; it defined these incidents as “any deaths arising directly from
encounters with law enforcement . . . [such as] people who were shot, tasered and struck by
police vehicles as well those who died in police custody” and excluded persons who died of
self-inflicted injuries (Table 1) [12]. The website of the dataset also allowed members of the
public to report cases; however, all deaths in the 2015–2016 dataset were substantiated based
on local news media reports with the exception of 5 deaths identified via The Guardian’s origi-
nal reporting [19]. The Guardian staff extracted characteristics of each incident including the
decedent’s name, demographic information, street address of the police encounter, date of the
injury occurrence, and mechanism of death. They also included a brief narrative description of
events leading to the death. When necessary, reporting staff requested more information from
local government agencies.
The NVSS receives electronic mortality data, based on death certificates, on deaths from all
causes that are reported by 52 US-based independent registration areas (“states”; including the
50 states, District of Columbia, and New York City, which reports independently of New York
State). On death certificates, funeral home directors record demographic information, and
coroners or medical examiners report cause of death information. Staff at state vital statistics
registries input death certificate information in a standardized electronic format. They send
these data to the National Center for Health Statistics, which assigns up to 20 cause of death
codes, following ICD-10, based on literal text written by the coroner/medical examiner. For a
majority of decedents—approximately 60% of cases coded as legal intervention deaths in 2015
—ICD codes are assigned by a computer program, SuperMICAR (National Center for Health
Statistics; https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mmds/super_micar.htm). Trained nosologists
assign codes when automatic assignment fails.
Exclusion criteria
The Counted used a broader definition for law-enforcement-related deaths than the NVSS,
which follows the ICD definition for legal intervention (Table 1). Unlike the ICD definition,
The Counted did not require that the injury be inflicted by a law enforcement officer and
made no differentiation as to whether the injury was inflicted while a law enforcement officer
was acting in the line of duty. To ensure that both datasets were comparable, we excluded
cases from The Counted that did not conform to the ICD definition of legal intervention,

 while also recognizing that ambiguity in the ICD definition can make it unclear whether the
diagnostic category is appropriate for certain instances. One category for which the definition
lacks clarity is motor-vehicle-related deaths involving law enforcement. While on duty, an offi-
cer may accidently hit a pedestrian, although it is unclear whether this death occurred “in the
course of arresting or attempting to arrest lawbreakers, suppressing disturbances, maintaining
order, and other legal action.” Because these injuries may not specifically relate to the officer’s
law enforcement role, we excluded decedents killed in motor-vehicle-related accidents unless
they were being pursued by police or were intentionally injured in a police vehicle during tran-
sit. Another category for which definitional ambiguities arise is “deaths in custody,” i.e., non-
firearm deaths that occur during the course of arrest or in holding cells and jails. In such
instances, the circumstances of the death may be unknown to the public, and it may not be
clear to death investigators whether actions by officers contributed to the death [20]. We
excluded deaths in custody unless The Counted described a clear mechanism through which
law enforcement actions may have caused the death (medical neglect, use of a chokehold, use
of a Taser) or the death was reportedly ruled a homicide in The Counted’s narrative descrip-
tion (a homicide ruling can be made only if the injury was intentionally inflicted, while legal
intervention, as defined by the ICD-10, does not require intentionality; however, a finding of
homicide also provides evidence that law enforcement officers caused the death).
Additional exclusion criteria included instances of domestic violence perpetrated by law
enforcement officers, as these did not occur in the course of carrying out “legal action.” For
the same reason, we excluded deaths by “friendly fire” (i.e., an accidental shooting of one offi-
cer by another; the only such death reported in the 2015 The Counted data occurred during a
training). Finally, we also excluded the small number of decedents (N = 3; <0.3% of deaths)
who were injured in 2015 but died in 2016, as they would not appear in the 2015 mortality
data.
National Death Index plus matching process
The National Death Index (NDI) is a restricted-access database, administered by the National
Center for Health Statistics, that researchers can use to access the same electronic mortality
data reported in the NVSS [21,22]. Requestors submit a list of decedents, and the NDI returns
either vital status only (i.e., confirmation of whether the individual has died) or, if the
researcher pays a higher fee for “NDI Plus,” all reported ICD-10 coded causes of death for
each decedent. For all cases meeting our inclusion criteria, we submitted names and years of
birth (based on media-reported age) using NDI Plus. NDI Plus requires that submitted data
include exact matches for first names, near matches for last names, and near matches for year
of birth (±1 year) [22]. Matched records return the state in which the death occurred, date of
death, and multiple ICD-10 coded causes of death. We identified true matches from NDI
Plus output by ensuring dates and states of death were consistent with media reports. We
considered the date of death to match when it fell within 4 days of the injury occurrence date
reported in The Counted.
We rejected cases for which the date of death preceded the reported date of injury by more
than 4 days. For cases whose NDI record reported a date of death more than 4 days after the
reported injury, we flagged the result as a match only if we were able to locate a news article
reporting the later date of death. Similarly, for deaths whose matched record reported a state
that differed from the location of injury reported by The Counted, we flagged it as a match if
we were able to locate a news article confirming the state of death (differing states for injury
and death can happen if a person is transported across state lines to a hospital before the
death). Finally, we tabulated the characteristics of matched cases and unmatched cases and

 stratified by measured covariates for comparison. Unmatched cases were not included in any
subsequent analyses.
Estimating the total number of law-enforcement-related deaths
Our first set of analyses used capture–recapture analysis (also known as multiple systems esti-
mation) to estimate the number of US law-enforcement-related deaths in 2015. Using 2 or
more matched, incomplete lists, capture–recapture analysis estimates the total size of a popula-
tion, including the number of cases missed by all lists [23]. To conduct the capture–recapture
analysis, we obtained monthly counts of deaths reported as legal intervention deaths in the
2015 NVSS public-use multiple cause of death file [24]. Using those counts along with the
dataset derived from matching The Counted and NDI, we estimated the number of deaths
(1) reported in The Counted only, (2) classified as legal intervention deaths in the NVSS only,
and (3) reported in both systems. We considered a case to be reported as a legal intervention
death in the NVSS when at least 1 of its multiple ICD-10 cause of death codes corresponded to
legal intervention (ICD-10: Y35.0–Y35.4; Y35.6–Y35.7; Y89.0). We assumed unmatched cases
from The Counted (95/1,086; 8.7%) were classified as legal intervention deaths in the NVSS at
the same rate as matched cases: we added 43 of these deaths (45%) to the group that was cap-
tured by both the NVSS and The Counted, and added the remaining 52 cases (55%) to the
group captured by The Counted only.
We used Poisson regression, with data stratified by 3-month periods, to conduct capture–
recapture analysis. The counts for each group (deaths captured by The Counted only, the
NVSS only, and both systems) analyzed by the Poisson model are presented in S1 Table. For
capture–recapture analyses with only 2 data sources, the method assumes independence
between the lists (i.e., the probability of a case appearing in one list is uncorrelated with its
probability of appearing in the other list). This assumption is frequently violated in epidemio-
logic contexts, however: often there is positive list dependence, which leads to underestimated
population sizes [25]. In our study, one possible source of list dependence is that both data-
bases typically rely on reporting by police departments to ascertain cases, either when the
agency issues press releases (in the case of media reports) or when it releases reports detailing
the circumstances of the death to the coroner or medical examiner (in the case of the NVSS).
With respect to the latter, journalists have revealed multiple incidents in which law enforce-
ment agencies failed to release pertinent documents to death investigators for in-custody
deaths or pressured death investigators to make a finding of non-homicide [26–28], although
there is no evidence to suggest how frequently this occurs.
To address the potential for list dependence, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to estimate
the maximum plausible number of cases adjusting for a prior correlation value between our 2
lists. We followed the method employed by Lum and Ball [29], who incorporated prior values,
based on capture–recapture analyses of homicides from comparable sources in 5 other coun-
tries, when they estimated the number of law-enforcement-related deaths in the US from 2
probabilistically matched law enforcement datasets. By including the highest pairwise list cor-
relation value they reported (0.93, based on a study of homicides in Syria) as an offset in our
Poisson model, we calculated a maximum plausible estimate of the number of deaths in this
sensitivity analysis.
Analyzing correlates of misclassification in National Vital Statistics
System mortality data
Our next set of analyses sought to identify correlates of misclassification of legal intervention
deaths in NVSS mortality data, with misclassification defined as there not being any ICD-10

 codes for legal intervention among the reported multiple causes of death. For the purpose of
these analyses, we assumed The Counted’s matched cases were a random sample of the total
population of US law-enforcement-related deaths in 2015. This is a tenable assumption
because, as we report below, The Counted underreports relatively few incidents, and there
appear to be no systematic differences between matched and unmatched cases. We used demo-
graphic data (age, gender, and race/ethnicity) reported in The Counted, which our prior
research has found to be highly concordant with values reported on death certificates [15]. We
also used The Counted data on mechanism of death (firearm or non-firearm) and the county
where the fatal injury occurred. At the county level, we identified median household income
quintiles based on 2011–2015 US Census data [30], urbanicity based on National Center for
Health Statistics classifications [31], and death investigator type (medical examiner, elected
coroner, or appointed coroner) based on a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
dataset [32]. For counties with ambiguous CDC data regarding death investigator type, we
contacted local government agencies directly.
After tabulating descriptive statistics on misclassified and properly classified legal interven-
tion deaths, we calculated and mapped misclassification rates by state. We then conducted
multilevel logistic regression, using Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp [https://www.stata.com]), to
model the odds of misclassification. Our univariable and multivariable models included ran-
dom intercepts for counties and states. We used post-estimation commands to calculate the
average marginal effects for select covariates, and we report these as predicted probabilities of
misclassification.
Results
The Counted identified 1,146 law-enforcement-related deaths in the US during 2015. Applying
our exclusion criteria, we eliminated 60 cases that did not conform to the ICD definition of
legal intervention, such that the initial dataset included 1,086 observed deaths (Table 2).
Among the 1,086 observed cases, the majority were ages 18–44 years (766/1,086; 70.5%),
were men (1,043/1,086; 90.6%), were killed by a firearm (1,008/1,086; 92.8%), resided in a
large metro area (583/1,086; 53.7%), and had their death reported by a medical examiner
(682/1,086; 57.8%) (Table 3). Additionally, 27.1% (294/1,086) of decedents were black, 17.2%
were Hispanic (187/1,086), 1.1% were American Indian (12/1,086), 2.0% were Asian/Pacific
Islander (22/1,086), 50.9% were white non-Hispanic (553/1,086), and 1.7% were of unknown
race/ethnicity (18/1,086) (Table 3); the corresponding national estimates for the racial/ethnic

 composition of the US population in 2015 were 13.0% black, 17.6% Hispanic, 0.8% American
Indian, 5.9% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 62.6% white non-Hispanic [33].
We identified true matches for 91.3% (991/1,086) of included cases using NDI Plus
(Table 3). Matching rates were lower than 85% for decedents who were women (36/43; 83.7%),
had missing race/ethnicity (14/18; 77.8%), or had death certified by an appointed coroner (29/
35; 82.9%). Results from Fisher’s exact tests show that among these individual- and county-
level characteristics, the only variable for which differences in matching rates were statistically
significant (p = 0.049) was the death investigator type. These tests did not adjust for clustering
by counties, however; p-values for county-level variables are therefore biased downward and
may suggest statistically significant differences in matching rates where none exist.
Among the 991 matched cases, firearm deaths comprised 92.8%, or 920/991 cases (Table 4).
The second most common mechanism was death due to Taser (46/991; 4.6%). This was fol-
lowed by struck by/against injuries (18/991; 1.8%), motor-vehicle-related injuries (5/991;
0.4%), and neglect (3/991; 0.3%).
Overall, 444 (44.8%) of the law-enforcement-related deaths were properly classified as legal
intervention deaths in the NVSS. The most common underlying cause of death for misclassi-
fied cases was assault, which was more prevalent than legal intervention and accounted for
47.5% of all matched cases (N = 471). While nearly all firearm deaths were coded as legal inter-
vention or assault (96.8% combined), the causes of death reported for non-firearm mecha-
nisms were more heterogeneous. Deaths that followed the use of Tasers were reported as legal
intervention (6/46; 13%), assault (10/46; 21.7%), missing/undetermined (8/46; 17.4%), acci-
dental injury (10/46, 21.7%), and mental health/behavioral disorders (5/46; 10.9%). Struck
by/against was the only other non-firearm mechanism for which any cases were classified as
legal intervention (4/18 struck by/against injuries; 22.2%).
Estimates of the number of US law-enforcement-related deaths in 2015
There were 599 deaths reported in The Counted only, 36 reported in the NVSS only, 487
reported in both lists, and an estimated 44 (95% CI: 31, 62) not reported in either list. Assum-
ing independence between lists, our capture–recapture model estimates that the total number
of US law-enforcement-related deaths in 2015 was 1,166 (95% CI: 1,153, 1,184) (Fig 1). This
suggests that the NVSS documented 44.9% (95% CI: 44.2%, 45.4%) of law-enforcement-related
deaths, and The Counted documented 93.1% (95% CI: 91.7%, 94.2%). Our sensitivity analyses
show that these estimates are robust to potential pairwise list correlation. Assuming the highest
of the pairwise list correlation values reported by Lum and Ball [29], 0.93, the maximum num-
ber of deaths was only slightly higher, equaling 1,233 (95% CI: 1,200, 1,280). Under this maxi-
mum scenario, The Counted documented 88.1% (95% CI: 84.8%, 90.5%) of cases, and the
NVSS documented 42.4% (95% CI: 40.9%, 43.6%).
Correlates of ICD-10 misclassification of law-enforcement-related
deaths
We found that, among cases reported in The Counted and matched to NVSS data, 55.2% (547/
991) were misclassified in the NVSS. These deaths occurred in 51 states (49 states, the District
of Columbia, and New York City; The Counted did not report any cases from Rhode Island
meeting our inclusion criteria) (Table 5; Fig 2) and in 491 of 3,144 US counties. Misclassifica-
tion rates ranged from 0% to 100%; among states with �10 matched cases, rates ranged from
17.6% (Washington) to 100.0% (Oklahoma). Taken together, 5 states—California, Texas, Flor-
ida, Oklahoma, and Arizona—contained 42.4% of matched cases and accounted for a majority
of the misclassified cases (50.3%). Among these 5 states, misclassification was 40% to <60% in

1Mortality records report 1 underlying cause of death, defined as “(a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the
accident or violence which produced the fatal injury” [22]. The records also report up to 20 “multiple causes of death” based on any other health conditions reported on the death
certificate. In rare instances (N = 2), legal intervention was reported as a multiple cause of death but not an underlying cause of death. We nonetheless present these cases in the
column for legal intervention.
2Excludes legal execution, Y35.5.
3A classification of “events of undetermined intent” signifies that the coder knew (based on death certificate literal text) that the cause of death involved external injuries, but could not
identify whether the injury was due to legal intervention, assault, suicide, or accident. “Missing” signifies that the coder was unable to make any determination whatsoever about cause
of death.

 with a non-firearm mechanism of death (61/71; 85.9%), and those who died in a county in the
second lowest income quintile (124/196; 63.3%). Misclassification rates were lower than 40%
among persons who were Asian/Pacific Islander (8/21; 38.1%) and those who died in the
highest income counties (76/198; 38.4%). Chi-squared tests of independence found that mis-
classification rates exhibited statistically significant differences by race/ethnicity (p = 0.04),
mechanism of death (p < 0.01), and county income quintile (p < 0.01).
The multivariable mixed-effects logistic model (Table 7), which controlled for all individ-
ual- and county-level covariates, identified statistically significant differences in misclassifica-
tion rates by mechanism of death (odds ratio [OR] for non-firearm versus firearm: 68.2; 95%
CI: 15.7, 297.5; p < 0.01) and county median household income quintile (OR: 10.1; 95% CI:
2.4, 42.8; p < 0.01). Using average values for all other covariates, the predicted probability of
misclassification for firearm deaths was 48.6% (95% CI: 41.5%, 55.6%), while for non-firearm
deaths it was 86.4% (95% CI: 78.2%, 94.6%). For deaths occurring in the highest-income-quin-
tile counties, the predicted probability of misclassification was 33.4% (95% CI: 23.3%, 43.5%),
while among the lowest-income-quintile counties the probability was 57.2% (95% CI: 46.8%,
67.6%). Finally, there was 2.7 times more variability in misclassification rates within states
(county-level variance for random intercepts = 7.1) than between states (variance = 2.7).
Discussion
We estimated the total number of law-enforcement-related deaths in the US in 2015–1,166
deaths (95% CI: 1,153, 1,184)—and found that, as hypothesized, a much higher proportion of
such deaths were captured by The Guardian’s The Counted (93.1%; 95% CI: 91.7%, 94.2%)

 than by US vital statistics data (44.9%; 95% CI: 44.2%, 45.4%). We also found that misclassifi-
cation rates in NVSS data for law-enforcement-related deaths varied widely both within and
between states, and that misclassification was more likely for non-firearm deaths than firearm
deaths and for deaths that occurred outside of the highest income counties. These findings
together affirm that major shortcomings exist in official counts of law-enforcement-related
deaths based on US vital statistics. The results additionally suggest these shortcomings could
potentially be corrected by simultaneously (1) improving the extent and accuracy of the infor-
mation recorded in death certificates and (2) expanding the types of data employed (such as
media-based reports) utilized to generate official counts of these cases.
Our study is strengthened by its use of identifiable, national US mortality data to estimate
the number of law-enforcement-related deaths and to analyze patterns of misclassification of
these deaths in the NVSS. One limitation is that differential matching rates for our NVSS/The
Counted dataset may bias results, although the high proportion of cases that we were able to
match limits this bias. Additionally, we were unable to examine the characteristics of cases that
were unreported in The Counted. One issue of concern is that law-enforcement-related deaths
occurring in rural areas may not be reported in the news media, because there is less local
news coverage available in rural areas and rural news sources may not be accessible on the
internet [34]. Another issue is that we cannot know with complete certainty in which county
the death was declared; The Counted reports the location where the fatal injury was inflicted.
While data from California suggest that four-fifths of persons fatally injured by law enforce-
ment die immediately [35], an unknown proportion of the remaining one-fifth may die at a
hospital in another county. Facilities best equipped to treat gunshot wounds, such as level I
trauma centers, are more likely to be located in urban and higher income counties [36], so this
could lead to measurement error for county-level variables. Finally, The Counted data do not
include deaths that occurred in 2015 due to an injury inflicted in 2014, so any such cases are
absent from the analyses. However, this is likely a very small number of cases (for injuries
inflicted in 2015, we identified only 3 cases, or <0.3% of deaths, for which the death occurred
in 2016).
Our estimates, derived from capture–recapture analysis, for the total number of law-
enforcement-related deaths in 2015 are robust to pairwise list dependence. Because of the high
degree of overlap between our 2 data sources (i.e., a large proportion of deaths reported in the
NVSS were also reported in The Counted), any potential list dependency had minimal effect
on the overall estimate. The Counted was more effective at identifying deaths: a case was
approximately twice as likely to be reported in The Counted compared to the NVSS. Compar-
ing its coverage rate to previous estimates produced by the BJS, The Counted outperformed
ARD (which captured an estimated 49% of deaths over the period 2003–2011, excluding 2010)
as well as the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports data (which captured an estimated 46%
of deaths over the same period) [4].

 Only 2 prior studies have used capture–recapture analysis to estimate the number of US
law-enforcement-related deaths. First, a BJS analysis for the period 2003–2011 (excluding
2010) was based on probabilistically matched deaths from 2 national law enforcement sources
and estimated that there were on average 928 annual law-enforcement-related deaths in the

 US [4]. The authors of the BJS study note that many law enforcement agencies did not report
any deaths to either system, and, once they accounted for nonresponse, their estimate was
approximately 1,200, on par with our estimate. Second, Lum and Ball [29], adjusting for poten-
tial list dependency but not for agency nonresponse, used the same BJS data to estimate an
annual mean of 1,500 deaths in the US, which is higher than our estimate. They state that
adjusting for nonresponse would increase their estimate by an additional 30%. Differences
between these prior estimates and our own may be attributable to (1) an actual change in the
incidence of law-enforcement-related deaths, (2) uncertainty in the magnitude of list depen-
dence, or (3) potential error in the prior estimates introduced by the imprecision of probabilis-
tic matching.
We found that the majority of misclassified cases for the most common cause of death—
fatal gunshot wounds by law enforcement—were incorrectly coded as assault. As hypothesized,
a higher risk of misclassification occurred for the less common phenomenon of law-enforce-
ment-related deaths involving injury mechanisms other than firearms. This may reflect a lack
of consensus among coroners and medical examiners about how to report non-firearm deaths
in police custody [37]. Notably, cause of death classification was especially inaccurate for law-
enforcement-related deaths due to Taser shocks, which was the second most common mecha-
nism after firearms.
While misclassification of law-enforcement-related deaths is a problem throughout the
country, affecting 55% of mortality records nationally, the probability of misclassification var-
ied widely both within and between states, and also by social and economic groups. Descrip-
tive analyses found higher probabilities of misclassification among decedents who were under
age 18 years, black, or residing in the poorest county income quintiles, suggesting researchers
should exercise caution when comparing rates of law-enforcement-related mortality among
various sociodemographic groups using only national-level data. However, in our analyses
that accounted for systematic differences in odds of misclassification by state and county (i.e.,
the multilevel models), only county income quintile remained significantly associated with
risk of misclassification. Possible explanations for the inverse association between county
income and odds of misclassification may include better resources and training among coro-
ners/medical examiners in wealthier counties and differences in the political culture in wealth-
ier counties that lead to greater transparency in relation to law-enforcement-related deaths.
Even so, contrary to our hypotheses, we did not find that misclassification differed by death
investigator type. It may be that extent of training and resources matters more to mitigate mis-
classification than death investigator type.
Misclassification of cause of death is a longstanding and ongoing concern in US vital statis-
tics, and the validity of these reported data may vary widely depending on the type of disease
or injury [38,39]. However, evidence suggests that the accuracy of mortality classification for
homicide—an outcome similar to law-enforcement-related mortality in that it is also certified
by coroners and medical examiners—is very high. A prior study of large US cities found a
near-perfect correlation between homicide counts reported in the NVSS and homicide counts
reported in Supplementary Homicide Reports [40]. For law-enforcement-related deaths, how-
ever, correlations between the same 2 systems are considerably lower [1,13].
Future research and implications
Future studies could estimate the number of law-enforcement-related deaths, nationally or
subnationally, using data from additional years and sources. Alternative data sources for these
deaths include the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), which covers 40 US
states and the District of Columbia as of 2017 [41], and deaths-in-custody lists maintained by

 the attorneys general of California [35] and Texas [42]. Additionally, state offices of vital statis-
tics and departments of health can identify the shortcomings of their current vital statistics
data by reviewing death certificates for law-enforcement-related deaths. It will also be useful to
evaluate whether making such deaths a notifiable condition improves reporting [9], per new
legislation enacted in Tennessee in 2017 [43].
There are multiple interventions that may improve public health monitoring of law-
enforcement-related deaths. Examples include training medical examiners and coroners to
indicate law enforcement involvement in death certificate literal text, increasing the use of
news media reports as a data source for NVDRS states, and legally requiring disclosure of
these deaths to health departments [43] or death investigators [27]. Additionally, health
departments can create websites to provide the public with real-time reports of law-enforce-
ment-related deaths that occur within their jurisdiction. This can be coupled with the inclu-
sion of such deaths in a jurisdiction’s list of notifiable conditions, which would allow for
reporting of these deaths to health departments by medical staff, first responders, and mem-
bers of the public [18].
Improving public health monitoring of law-enforcement-related mortality is a critical part
of efforts to ensure public accountability for these incidents and prevent future incidents. Also
warranting attention is improved monitoring of nonfatal injuries due to law enforcement,
which currently are not captured by any official or media-based reporting system [44]. Better-
quality data would allow researchers to quantify various forms of social inequality that may be
linked to law-enforcement-related mortality (e.g., differences by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
position, and gender identity), compare rates between jurisdictions, and identify whether inci-
dence is increasing or decreasing over time [18,44].
