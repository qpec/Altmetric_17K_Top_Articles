Ohio is experiencing unprecedented loss of life caused by 
unintentional drug overdoses (1), with illicitly manufactured 
fentanyl (IMF) emerging as a significant threat to public health 
(2,3). IMF is structurally similar to pharmaceutical fentanyl, 
but is produced in clandestine laboratories and includes 
fentanyl analogs that display wide variability in potency (2); 
variations in chemical composition of these drugs make detec-
tion more difficult. During 2010–2015, unintentional drug 
overdose deaths in Ohio increased 98%, from 1,544 to 3,050.* 
In Montgomery County (county seat: Dayton), one of the epi-
centers of the opioid epidemic in the state, unintentional drug 
overdose deaths increased 40% in 1 year, from 249 in 2015 to 
349 in 2016 (estimated unadjusted mortality rate = 57.7 per 
100,000) (4). IMFs have not been part of routine toxicology 
testing at the coroner’s offices and other types of medical and 
criminal justice settings across the country (2,3). Thus, data 
on IMF test results in the current outbreak have been limited. 
The Wright State University and the Montgomery County 
Coroner’s Office/Miami Valley Regional Crime Laboratory 
(MCCO/MVRCL) collaborated on a National Institutes of 
Health study of fentanyl analogs and metabolites and other 
drugs identified in 281 unintentional overdose fatalities in 24 
Ohio counties during January–February 2017. Approximately 
90% of all decedents tested positive for fentanyl, 48% for acryl 
fentanyl, 31% for furanyl fentanyl, and 8% for carfentanil. 
Pharmaceutical opioids were identified in 23% of cases, and 
heroin in 6%, with higher proportions of heroin-related deaths 
in Appalachian counties. The majority of decedents tested 
positive for more than one type of fentanyl. Evidence sug-
gests the growing role of IMFs, and the declining presence of 
heroin and pharmaceutical opioids in unintentional overdose 
fatalities, compared with 2014–2016 data from Ohio and 
other states (3–5). There is a need to include testing for IMFs 
as part of standard toxicology panels for biological specimens 
used in the medical, substance abuse treatment, and criminal 
justice settings.
The MCCO Toxicology laboratory provides postmortem 
forensic toxicology services to approximately 30 of Ohio’s 
88 counties. Data from 281 unintentional overdose fatali-
ties that occurred in Montgomery County and 23 additional

counties† during January and February 2017, were analyzed 
by the MCCO Toxicology laboratory, and had assigned 
causes of death as of May 8, 2017, were included in this 
study. Montgomery County data include all unintentional 
drug overdose deaths that occurred in the county during the 
specified period. Other county data include all cases that 
were sent to MCCO for analysis, but might not represent all 
unintentional overdose deaths that occurred in those counties. 
A liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry–based 
method, developed and validated by toxicologists at the 
MCCO Toxicology Laboratory and Department of Chemistry, 
Wright State University, was used to test for 25 fentanyl ana-
logs, metabolites, and synthetic opioids§ in biologic matrices 
(human blood and urine specimens). 
Toxicologic testing for other substances (heroin, pharmaceu-
tical opioids, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methamphetamine, 
marijuana, and alcohol) was also conducted. Information 
on demographic characteristics including age, sex, and race 
was collected for each decedent. Counties were grouped into 
the following four urban/rural categories used by the Ohio 
Department of Health: 1) urban (Montgomery), 2) suburban, 
3) rural, non-Appalachian, and 4) Appalachian. The chi-square 
statistic was used to assess differences among the four county
groups in terms of demographic and drug-related character-
istics. To examine polydrug patterns, reports of the presence
of other fentanyl analogs/metabolites and other drugs were
examined for decedents with positive test results for 1) fentanyl, 
2) acryl fentanyl, 3) furanyl fentanyl, and 4) carfentanil, one
of the most potent fentanyl analogs.
Among the 281 decedents, 122 (43.3%) were from 
Montgomery County (City of Dayton), a large urban county 
with a population of approximately 530,000 persons (Table 1). 
Decedents from four suburban counties, who accounted

for 52 (18.5%) unintentional overdose deaths, were primarily 
from areas that are a part of or adjacent to the Dayton 
Metro area. Seventy-six (27.0%) decedents were from rural, 
non-Appalachian counties, primarily from the Southwestern 
part of the state, and 31 (11.0%) were from the Appalachian 
counties that are located in the Southern part of the state.
Males accounted for 181 (64.4%) unintentional overdose 
deaths, and 257 (91.5%) decedents were white; this propor-
tion was higher in rural (98.7%) and Appalachian (96.8%) 
counties (p = 0.007) (Table 2). Over half (57.7%) of deaths 
occurred in persons aged 25–44 years. Approximately 7% of 
all decedents were not residents of the county where they died, 
with larger numbers of out of county resident deaths in urban 
Montgomery County (9.8%).
Overall, 253 (90.0%), 136 (48.4%), and 87 (31.0%) 
decedents tested positive for fentanyl, acryl fentanyl, and 
furanyl fentanyl, respectively (Table 2). The proportions of 
decedents that were positive for acryl fentanyl and furanyl 
fentanyl were lower in Appalachian counties (29.0% and 
19.4%, respectively), although these differences were not sta-
tistically significant. There were statistically significantly more 
decedents in urban and suburban counties that tested posi-
tive for despropionylfentanyl (4-ANPP) (45.1% and 55.8%, 
respectively) than in rural (34.2%) and Appalachian (25.6%) 
counties (p = 0.021).
Only 16 (5.7%) of all 281 decedents tested positive for 
heroin, with a significantly higher proportion in Appalachian 
counties (25.8%) than in urban (2.5%), suburban (3.8%) 
or rural non-Appalachian counties (3.9%). Among all 16 
heroin-positive cases, 12 also tested positive for IMF. Overall, 
64 (22.8%) decedents tested positive for pharmaceutical 
opioids, 75 (26.6%) for benzodiazepines, and 86 (30.6%) for 
cocaine; a higher percentage of decedents who tested positive 
for cocaine died in urban (37.7%) and suburban (42.3%) 
counties than in rural (22.4%) or Appalachian (3.2%) coun-
ties (p<0.001) (Table 2).
Over half (53.8%) of specimens from fentanyl-positive 
decedents also tested positive for acryl fentanyl, and approxi-
mately one third (34.0%) for furanyl fentanyl (Table 3). 
Approximately 62% of fentanyl-positive decedents did not 
test positive for norfentanyl. All specimens from acryl fentanyl 
deaths also tested positive for fentanyl, and 39.7% tested 
positive for furanyl fentanyl. Approximately 99% of furanyl 
fentanyl deaths tested positive for fentanyl, 62.1% for acryl 
fentanyl, and 86.2% for 4-ANPP
.
Twenty-one decedents (including 11 [52%] in Montgomery 
County) tested positive for carfentanil. Among these, 15 
(71.4%) decedents also tested positive for fentanyl, five 
(23.8%) for acryl fentanyl, and eight (38.1%) for furanyl 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Illicitly manufactured fentanyl has become a significant contribu-
tor to unintentional overdose deaths in the United States.
What is added by this report?
Approximately 90% of unintentional overdose deaths examined 
in 24 Ohio counties that occurred during January–February 
2017 involved fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, or both, whereas 
heroin was identified in the minority (6%) of cases, with 
somewhat higher prevalence in Appalachian counties. Fentanyl 
is commonly appearing in combination with other analogs.
What are the implications for public health practice?
These findings highlight the urgent need to make illicitly 
manufactured fentanyl testing a part of standard toxicology 
panels for biological specimens. Because multiple naloxone 
doses are often required to reverse overdoses from illicitly 
manufactured fentanyl, assuring that sufficient supplies are 
provided to first responders and distributed through commu-
nity overdose prevention programs can mitigate the effects of 
opioid overdoses.

Discussion
Evidence from the toxicologic analyses of unintentional 
overdose deaths in Ohio from the beginning of 2017 indicate 
the increasing and substantial role of IMFs, and the declining 
presence of heroin and pharmaceutical opioids in overdose 
fatalities, compared with 2014–2016 data from Ohio and other 
states (3–5). Approximately 90% of unintentional overdose 
deaths in 24 Ohio counties that occurred during January and 
February 2017 involved fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, or both. 
Approximately 32% of fentanyl-positive decedents did not 
test positive for norfentanyl, a major metabolite for fentanyl, 
suggesting a very rapid death (6). Twenty-one decedents 
tested positive for carfentanil, a highly toxic IMF compound 
(approximately 10,000 times more potent than morphine), 
which is frequently used in veterinary medicine for sedation of 
large animals. Approximately one third of unintentional over-
dose deaths that tested positive for IMF also tested positive for 
cocaine. It is not known whether these data indicate a pattern 
of intended polydrug use or if cocaine and IMF mixtures were 
sold to unsuspecting illicit opioid or cocaine users.
The study documents the high numbers of acryl fentanyl– 
and furanyl fentanyl–associated deaths among unintentional 
overdose fatalities in the United States. Acryl fentanyl is 
more potent than fentanyl (7); in 2016, there were reports 
of furanyl fentanyl–related overdoses in Canada caused by 
smoking contaminated cocaine (8). These drugs are com-
monly advertised on cryptomarkets, which are commercial 
web-based marketplaces for transactions involving drugs and 
other illicit goods that provide anonymity to both buyers and 
sellers via their location on the “Dark” web (internet content 
that requires specific software or authorization to access) and 
use of cryptocurrencies (e.g., bitcoin) for payment. Nearly half 
of fentanyl positive cases and approximately 90% of furanyl 
fentanyl positives tested positive for 4-ANPP
. 4-ANPP is used 
as a precursor for the manufacture of fentanyl-type drugs; it 
is also an impurity found in fentanyl preparations and is a 
metabolite of fentanyl and furanyl fentanyl (9).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi-
tations. First, for counties other than Montgomery, uninten-
tional overdose numbers represent cases sent to MCCO for 
an autopsy and might not reflect all overdose deaths in that 
county. Further, it is not known whether there are systemic 
differences across counties (other than Montgomery County) 
regarding the types of cases sent to MCCO for testing. Second, 
toxicology reports cannot distinguish between pharmaceuti-
cal and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, although previous 
reports indicate that the majority of fentanyl linked to fatal 
unintentional overdoses in the country is suspected to be IMF 
(10). Third, toxicology data on decedents testing positive for 
multiple drugs cannot determine if the decedent knowingly 
or unknowingly used combinations of different drugs. Finally, 
data were obtained from 24 Ohio counties, and findings might 
not be generalizable to the entire state.
Overall, IMFs are appearing in combination with other 
fentanyl analogs, and co-occurrence of other drugs is common.

combinations of IMFs might indicate that available street drugs 
include mixtures of different types of IMFs or that persons use 
drugs obtained from multiple sources, with different toxico-
logic profiles. Expansion of access to evidence-based treatment 
is an important strategy for preventing fentanyl-related over-
doses (3). These findings highlight the urgent need to make 
IMF testing a part of standard toxicology panels for biological 
specimens used by substance abuse treatment centers, criminal 
justice institutions, and medical providers. Implementation of 
harm reduction initiatives could also help reduce the adverse 
consequences of IMF use (3,5). Because multiple naloxone 
doses are often required to reverse overdoses from IMFs (5), 
assuring that sufficient supplies are provided to first respond-
ers and distributed through community overdose prevention 
programs can mitigate the effects of opioid overdoses.
