Abstract
Background: Current research into alcohol consumption focuses predominantly on problematic drinkers and
populations considered likely to engage in risky behaviours. Middle-aged drinkers are an under-researched group,
despite emerging evidence that their regular drinking patterns may carry some risk.
Methods: We searched Scopus, Ovid Medline, and Ovid PsycInfo for peer-reviewed, English-language publications
appearing prior to 31 December 2015 and relating to the construction of alcohol consumption by middle-aged
non-problematised drinkers. Thirteen papers were included in our thematic analysis.
Results: Middle-aged non-problematised drinkers constructed their drinking practices by creating a narrative of
normative drinking via discourses of gender, identity, play, and learning to drink. They also used drinking norms to
construct their gender and identity. Health was not identified as a significant consideration for the population of
interest when constructing alcohol consumption, except where drinking behaviours were likely to harm another.
Conclusions: These results suggest that public health campaigns aimed at reducing alcohol consumption may be
more effective if they focus on unacceptable drinking behaviours instead of personal health outcomes.
Keywords: Alcohol consumption, Qualitative, Systematic review
Background
Alcohol drinking and non-drinking is a complex social
process influenced by a variety of factors and deeply em-
bedded in the social environment. The current body of
research into alcohol consumption focuses overwhelm-
ingly on problematised drinkers such as young drinkers
and binge drinkers. Low-level drinking is considered
unproblematic in many alcohol studies (especially socio-
logical studies) and in society more broadly [1]. In this
sense, low-level drinking is non-problematised. However,
low-level drinking can nonetheless be considered prob-
lematic since some alcohol studies (especially recent
epidemiological studies) demonstrate that it presents
health risks (increased all-cause mortality in the long
term) [2, 3]. Thus, groups not previously considered prob-
lematic
(which
we
henceforth
refer
to
as
non-
problematised drinkers) can nonetheless be conceived of
as drinking in ways that place them at risk.
One such group is middle-aged drinkers, whom we
have defined as 30–65 year olds. While drinking in this
age group has sometimes been problematised, such as in
the case of alcoholism or binge drinking [4, 5], this
group is rarely regarded as inherently problematic in the
same way that youth drinkers are [6]. Nonetheless, these
non-problematised drinkers may still drink in ways that
impact negatively on their long-term health. For example,
alcohol is a class 1 carcinogen with a dose response rela-
tionship and no known “safe” level of minimum drinking
[7], meaning that regular drinking increases cancer risk.
Daily drinking in Australia increases with age [8], and
Australian middle-aged drinkers drink in excess of lifetime
risk guidelines (no more than two standard drinks per
day) [7] in similar proportions to young drinkers. Recent
evidence indicates that 40–49 year-olds drink more alco-
hol than 18–24 year-olds [8]. In the United Kingdom,
mean alcohol consumption (units/week) is highest for

 men aged 55–64 years and for women aged 45–54 years [9].
In the United States of America, a slight long-term (since
2002) downward trend in drinking frequency and quantity
among adults under 25 years of age has coincided with a
slight long-term increase in these measures among adults
over 26 years of age [10]. The prevalence of high-frequency
drinking tends to increase among older drinkers as they age,
regardless of country, with the exceptions of Costa Rica,
Nicaragua, and Uganda (where it is lowest among men aged
35–49) and Brazil, Ireland, and Kazakhstan (where it is high-
est among the same age cohort) [11].
Despite the increasing evidence that alcohol con-
sumption among older drinkers is increasing over
time, and that older drinkers are consuming more
overall than younger drinkers, we know very little
about the motivations and decision-making processes
of non-problematised middle-aged drinkers when it
comes to their alcohol consumption. We sought to fill
this gap by systematically reviewing and synthesising
qualitative literature that describes the ways in which
non-problematised
middle-aged
drinkers
construct
their consumption of alcohol. Understanding alcohol
consumption in this group will support more effective
health interventions by, for instance, enabling health
promotion campaigns aimed at reducing alcohol con-
sumption among this group to speak to their greatest
concerns and priorities.
Methods
Defining non-problematised alcohol consumption
The purpose of this study was to describe the construc-
tions of the consumption of alcohol evident in academic
analysis of accounts of non-problematised middle-aged
drinking. We defined non-problematised alcohol con-
sumption as alcohol consumption that is neither signifi-
cantly harmful, nor socio-legally proscribed. We defined
significantly harmful consumption as:
consumption that significantly increases the risk of
ill health or injury to oneself or others, such as
binge drinking, drink driving, drinking while
pregnant, drinking after being diagnosed with a
medical condition adversely affected by alcohol
consumption (such as AIDS, Hepatitis, or CVD),
and drinking that constitutes a substance use
disorder (e.g. alcoholism and alcohol dependency).
We further defined socio-legally proscribed consumption
as:
consumption that occurs against the constraints of
prohibitive cultures (e.g. where religious conviction
requires or strongly commends abstinence) or illegal
consumption (e.g. where consumption is prohibited in
specific locations).
We included studies that included alcohol consumption
beyond recommended guidelines unless the drinkers ei-
ther self-identified their drinking as problematic or it
was presented by the authors as such.
Study selection process
We searched three databases: Scopus, Ovid Medline,
and Ovid PsycInfo, on the advice of the university’s
discipline search specialist (Additional file 1). EM and
NM also carried out hand-searches as described below.
No additional papers were identified through hand-
searching. The systematic review protocol was registered
with Prospero (CRD42016032871).
We assessed studies for inclusion against the following
questions:
1. Was this paper published in a peer-reviewed,
English-language journal?
2. Did this study examine the consumption of alcohol
as a beverage and examine how that consumption
was experienced, understood, or discussed by
participants, with regards to their own experience
of alcohol consumption?
3. Did this study meet the required standards of data
collection and analysis, e.g.: interviews or focus
groups; use of participant voices; acceptable quality
according to Critical Appraisal Skills Program
(CASP) analysis?
4. Did this study include the population of non-
problematised, middle-aged (30–65 year-olds) con-
sumers of alcohol?
Papers that did not meet these criteria were excluded
(see Fig. 1). Where papers met both exclusion and inclu-
sion criteria (e.g. featured mixed-age participants or a
combination of problematised and non-problematised
drinking) only data pertaining to the aims of the study
were included in the analysis.
An initial pool of 9813 search results was assessed by
EM and NM against title, keyword and abstract. NM’s
initial assessments (397 papers, determined by author
surname A) were also reviewed by EM who identified no
inappropriate exclusions, and so subsequent papers were
checked independently by either EM or NM with a com-
bined total of 245 papers for further analysis (Table 1).
We checked exclusions and inclusions as separate
stages due to the number of search results. The re-
viewers
then met and together checked inclusions
against the initial selection questions, to give a total of
144 papers.
EM
and
NM
then
independently
assessed
each
paper on the basis of a full-text reading. Any dis-
agreements were resolved through discussion, with 20
papers retained for data extraction and synthesis. EM

 subsequently hand-searched the publication lists of
thirteen authors recommended by three field experts
using a replication of the above process, with no add-
itional papers identified. Finally, EM searched the ref-
erence
lists
of
all
papers
included,
with
four
additional papers identified to give a total of 24 in-
cluded papers.
During the data extraction and synthesis phases, some
papers were identified as inappropriate for the aims of
the study [12]. Reasons for exclusion at this point were
that the reviewed studies failed to meet inclusion cri-
teria, as typified below:
� did not focus on the participants’ experience of
drinking, but instead focussed on the cultural
context in which drinking took place
� featured poor or unclear supporting data (e.g. assertions
made without clear evidence to support them).
These papers were rejected as they did not meet in-
clusion
criteria
regarding
participants’
participants
own voices discussing their experience of alcohol
consumption.
Data Extraction & Synthesis
EM read and re-read each paper, extracting key findings
using a data extraction form (Additional file 2). This
customised
form
(modelled
after
recommendations
found in Campbell et al. [12]) incorporated a modified
version of the CASP Qualitative Checklist [13] as well as
fields for extracting information about major themes
and key findings of the papers. NM repeated this process
on 6 papers as a check, with agreement on the CASP as-
sessment and key findings of the papers. We placed key
findings into a matrix with the papers’ pertinent meta-
data and coded them to themes, further identifying in-
teractions between themes across the included papers.
Themes were determined through EM and NM’s discus-
sion of key results, identifying repeated elements be-
tween and within papers.

Summary of papers
The majority of papers included in this review were
from the UK (9), with Scotland (4) and England (4) be-

Principal findings
We found that middle-aged drinkers expressed under-
standings of normative drinking through the four inter-
related themes of gender, play, identity, and learning to
drink. These four themes shaped understandings of nor-
mative drinking in ways that also provided alternative in-
terpretations of gender and identity (Fig. 2).
Normative drinking
Normative drinking describes how people define both
acceptable and unacceptable drinking practices. Accept-
able drinking was framed as respectable drinking that
was appropriate to one’s age or stage of life and which
allowed participants to meet their responsibilities. By
contrast, unacceptable drinking was drinking that was
inappropriate to one’s age or stage of life and/or pre-
vented one from meeting their responsibilities.
Acceptable and unacceptable drinking practices were
defined by numerous factors, including the presence or
absence of certain behaviours in public and effects on
the drinker. Across the dataset, we consistently found
that participants stated that drinkers should neither ex-
perience nor display any negative effects of their drink-
ing, such as slurred speech, vomiting, an unsteady gait,
or a hangover the next day [14]. In Ling et al. [15], par-
ticipants associated these effects with people who had
problems with drinking, or with young drinkers: one
participant described “these young teenagers on the
streets can’t walk, sort of like collapsed in a heap cos
they’ve drank that much” [15]. Being able to meet work
and domestic responsibilities was also frequently men-
tioned, especially in studies among parents and care-
givers [16, 17]. Another important factor in determining
acceptable and unacceptable drinking was that others
should not suffer as a consequence of a person’s drink-
ing: thus, drink-driving was always constructed as un-
acceptable [15], and responsible parenting required that
parents limit alcohol consumption [16].
The boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable
drinking were also described in terms of being appropri-
ate or inappropriate to one’s age and stage of life. For
some participants, cosmetic issues such as weight, ap-
pearance, and premature ageing [17, 18] were deemed
important in determining appropriate levels of con-
sumption. For example, participants in Lyons et al. [17]
described how their ageing bodies responded to alcohol,
such that avoiding the negative effects of drinking re-
quired them to consume less and to closely monitor
their own bodily response to alcohol. Similarly, some
mothers in Killingsworth’s ethnography said that grow-
ing older meant that respectable behaviour involved
drinking less; they were pleased to discover that a mu-
tual acquaintance was pregnant, since this would force
her to drink less and thus better conform to their notion
of acceptable and respectable middle-aged parenting be-
haviour [19].
Ling et al. [15] described a way of determining accept-
able drinking whereby participants defined a “safe” level of
alcohol consumption according to their own experiences,
actively rejecting as irrelevant government drinking guide-
lines and public health messages (apart from messages
around drinking and driving). For example, one partici-
pant stated, “I’ve seen all the education, I don’t think I
drink excessively but if you put me on a scale according to
the Government I am off the scale but, I feel fit, healthy
…” [15]. This positioned his experience of feeling fit and
healthy as the authoritative determinant of acceptable
drinking, not Government statements. Some participants
explicitly described particular drinking behaviours as
healthy; they described red wine as being good for the
heart and circulation [14] and men drinking together as
good for mental health [1]. By contrast, Brierley-Jones et
al. [18] reported that drinkers in the traditional pub set-
tings were indifferent about any link between alcohol and
health and were likely to “see the relationship between al-
cohol and future health, in nihilistic terms, as something
largely outside of their control,” describing it as being “like
a lottery” [18].
Acceptable drinking further differed depending on lo-
cation. Brierley-Jones et al. [18], utilising Bourdieu’s
Fig. 2 A model of themes which shape normative drinking

 concept of habitus,1 described how two locations gave
rise
to
differing acceptable practices, distinguishing
between the patterns of the “home” and “traditional”
habitus of drinking. The former was associated with
moderate consumption of wine throughout the week,
while the latter was associated with more expansive con-
sumption of beer and/or spirits in pubs on weekends.
Normative drinking was also context-driven: the same
behaviour could be acceptable in one context, but un-
acceptable in another. For example, in Nesvåg and
Duckert [20], work-related drinking featured a transition
from formal to informal or social phases of an event,
with differences in acceptable drinking practices. Apply-
ing informal drinking practices to the formal phase was
considered by participants to be a faux pas, which the
authors described as carrying a “risk of being margina-
lised” [20].
Gender
Part of what made drinking acceptable or unacceptable
in these studies was how drinking patterns adhered to
gendered expectations of behaviour. Drinking practices
were used as a tool to express and display adherence to
and transgression of gender norms. What and where
participants drank also mattered. For example, in several
studies from the United Kingdom, certain drinks were
considered appropriate for women and others for men
[1, 16, 17, 21], and domestic drinking was associated
with women, public drinking, with men [1].
In Holloway et al. [22], some female participants chal-
lenged particular gendered drinking norms but reaf-
firmed
others.
For
example,
respondent
Audrey,
comfortable going to pubs herself, related that “… I find
it a bit odd in this day and age, I know there are still
women that I know who wouldn’t meet you in a pub,
and certainly wouldn’t go to the bar, and some people
locally their husbands always buy the drinks” [22]. None-
theless, although challenging the norm that pubs are for
men, she was more permissive of male drinking, saying
that she felt “less negatively towards a drunk man than I
do towards a drunk woman” [22].
As mentioned earlier, men also experienced con-
straints on their drinking: whilst men were less scruti-
nised in how much they drank, they were nonetheless
constrained in what and where they could drink. This is
not to say that men could not move outside gendered
norms of drinking: in Emslie et al. [1], participants Gra-
ham, Ewan, and Hugh drew on the social capital of wine
connoisseurship to construct alternate masculinities, and
other men stated that drinking outside of the ‘pints in
pubs’ model could be done in “exceptional circum-
stances” such as holidays and special occasions. [1].
Emslie et al. [1] also showed how adherence to some
gendered norms of drinking allowed the transgression of
other gendered norms. They described how men’s adher-
ence to a very masculine model of alcohol consumption
of pints at the pub enabled men to do un-masculine
“emotional labour” (i.e. talking about feelings) around
mental wellbeing [1]. Here, the un-masculine work of
talking about feelings was counterbalanced by the highly
masculinised model of drinking.
Identity
In these studies, identity was important for construc-
tions of acceptable and unacceptable drinking. How
people drink both contributes to their identity, and is
shaped by the identity they have crafted for them-
selves. For example, Ho [23] found that the display of
alcohol-related knowledge (whilst drinking) for white-
collar women in Japan was “useful for enhancing their
image as corporate executives in business dealings, in
addition to projecting themselves as cosmopolitan in-
dividuals” [23]. Thurnell-Read [24] further reported
that participants in his study “thought of and spoke
of themselves as ‘ale drinkers’”, with routines peculiar
to the identity of ale drinkers enacted only when or-
dering and drinking an ale with other members of
the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA)2 [24].
Alcohol consumption was also regarded as a way of
reclaiming past identities, or transitioning from one
identity to another. In Ling et al. [15], drinking was de-
scribed by one male participant as a way of reclaiming
his identity before parenting by “[making] you feel like
an adult again” [15]. Women in the same study de-
scribed drinking as a way of “reliving [their] youth”, ob-
serving how particular drinks were associated with
earlier identities [15].
Play
Normative drinking was closely tied to ideas of lay: in
many papers, alcohol consumption signalled the cessa-
tion of work or responsibilities, and also a social or leis-
ure activity in its own right.
We noted the use of alcohol as a marker of the bound-
aries of work or responsibility across cultures. Commen-
cing drinking was described as a way of declaring that
work or other responsibilities were completed and that
recreation and relaxation had begun [16, 17, 21]. Alcohol
was also described as being instrumental in creating the
state of post-work relaxation [22].
Drinking norms specific to social settings can also be
seen in the relationship between guest and host. Hollo-
way et al. [22] described how “complex systems of soci-
ality, hospitality and reciprocity” led participants, even
non-drinkers, to feel compelled to keep a variety of alco-
holic beverages about the house in order to fulfil the role
of host [14]. Emslie et al. [16] described the difficulties
of maintaining appropriate drinking behaviour in home
Muhlack et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:1016 
Page 5 of 10
 settings, where acceptable drinking practices can be
paradoxical: participants in their study described how a
good host ensures that guests’ glasses are constantly
topped up, constituting pressure to drink, but (as we
highlighted earlier) drinking norms dictate that drinkers
avoid obvious signs of drunkenness. Thus, we note that
the duty of the guest to consume the constantly refresh-
ing supply, flowing from the largesse of the host, is
incompatible with the guest’s duty to exercise self-con-
trol. Participants in the 2012 study by Emslie et al. [16]
negotiated this paradox through the provision of suitable
excuses to limit or avoid drinking, such as detoxing or
being on a diet.
Alcohol consumption was described as a focussed leis-
ure activity by Thurnell-Read [24]. His study of “Real
Ale Enthusiasts” showed that, rather than being a signal
of relaxation, the consumption of alcohol and the
connoisseurship around it functioned as a recreational
activity in its own right [24]. Participants in the study
explicitly contrasted their CAMRA drinking with “nor-
mal” drinking, and one described having to “watch your-
self sometimes” to ensure that the serious leisure activity
of CAMRA connoisseurship did not spill over into social
time spent with those who are “into their beers but not
like I am” to avoid “feel [ing] like a daft prat” [24].
Learning to drink
The final theme apparent in these studies is the idea that
normative drinking is something that people learn, both
from family and culture as well as from knowledge of
personal preferences and the effects of alcohol on them.
This involved learning the “skill” of non-problematised
drinking, as well as learning about alcohol and how to
display that knowledge as part of normative drinking
behaviours.
Illustrating how drinking patterns could be learned
from family heritage and local tradition, Brierley-Jones
et al. [18] demonstrated how the reproduction of
traditional drinking habitus established a connection
between
present-day
white-collar
drinkers
and
a
blue-collar history of family and community. By drinking
in the village pub that used to service the foundry,
drinkers in the traditional habitus could align themselves
with this blue-collar history “despite the non-physicality
of white-collar work” [18]. Drinkers in both the home
and traditional habitus described the importance of their
parents’ behaviours in establishing their own drinking
behaviours and attitudes. The authors detailed how a
taste for particular beverages could be acquired, with
one respondent explaining how one would begin to
drink as a social act and then “you start liking it” [18].
Finally, Lyons et al. outlined how participants’ personal
limits on alcohol were learned from past experience,
with the bodily experience of alcohol consumption
becoming “so well-rehearsed that they no longer require
conscious intervention or scrutiny” [17].
Interactions between themes
Gender, identity, play, and learning to drink each help to
define normative drinking. In addition, as we explain
below, they interact with each another to build a more
complex picture of the nature of normative drinking.
It is clear from these studies that gendered norms of
drinking affected the mode of play. For example, for
men within Lyon’s et al. study, “drinking alcohol pro-
vided embodied pleasure as a reward for working hard”
[17]; for women, drinking with friends was an acceptable
way to relax and take time away from domestic respon-
sibilities
(e.g.
housework,
childcare)
and, for
some
women, away from paid employment [17]. In Emslie’s
study, however, the separation from responsibility was
incomplete as women still “retained the main responsi-
bility for their children” [21]. For these women, accept-
able drinking practices were constrained by “the effect
on children if they saw their mothers drinking (exces-
sively),” [21]. These gendered expectations worked to
limit the extent to which women were able to relax.
In other studies, the interaction between gender and
normative drinking served not simply to limit, but also
to prevent opportunities for play. Holloway et al. [22]
described how participant Doris (a widow) was excluded
from some social opportunities due to her gender and
age, given perceptions that “it’s not seemly for a woman
of [her] age to walk down and go in to the pub on her
own” [22].
The interaction between gender, play, identity, and
normative drinking was also evident in the work envir-
onment. Female managers in the study of workplace cul-
ture by Nesvåg and Duckert [20] felt constrained by
gendered and work-specific drinking norms, with one
woman stating that “in company organised parties I feel
my way of drinking is a part of the management per-
formance,” a clear contrast to the nature of alcohol con-
sumption as play [20]. In a study of female managers in
Norway by Buvik and Sagvaag [25], the interaction of
these themes served to limit alcohol consumption. Alco-
hol was so strongly associated with relaxation that the
women interviewed were reluctant to drink in the work
environment because it could undermine the control
that they were expected to maintain, both as women and
as managers. Their visible status as managers and
women created a restrictive environment that limited ac-
ceptable drinking practices. While women could take
the opportunities for recreation and relaxation afforded
by alcohol consumption, this was either (1) in a home
environment, (2) with other managers, or (3) with more
restrictive limits on acceptable behaviour than those en-
countered by male colleagues. Some participants stated
Muhlack et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:1016 
Page 6 of 10
 that they would rather forgo workplace drinking entirely
in order to fulfil gendered care-related duties [25]. As
noted above, Emslie et al. [21] similarly reported that
some women experienced incomplete separation from
their domestic duties, which prevented them from fully
engaging in recreation and relaxation activities. Ultim-
ately, drinking practices that were otherwise acceptable
in the work context were restricted by gendered expecta-
tions of the roles of manager and mother. However, the
authors described attempts by some women to move be-
yond these restrictions with nights out, when they es-
caped “from their work and domestic responsibilities”
[21] and followed new drinking norms that allowed
them to resolve “multiple co-existing femininities while
keeping a coherent sense of one’s self and identity” [21].
Just as gendered norms of drinking affected the mode
of play, so gendered drinking norms could construct an
identity
that
moved
beyond
simplistic
binaries
of
gender-appropriate behaviour. A study of playgroup
mothers in Australia showed how they consumed and
discussed alcohol in ways that skirted the edges of gen-
der expectations without actually transgressing them:
the mothers drank, but not too much, or they talked
about drinking, rather than actually drinking [19]. In this
way, the women simultaneously reinforced, and resisted,
“dominant, relatively traditional notions of (female) gen-
der and motherhood” [19]. Ho [23] later described how,
in Japan, women in white-collar professional employ-
ment participated in the recreational practices of drink-
ing
and
host
clubs
(an
environment
historically
restricted to men, and still somewhat gendered) to de-
fine themselves as sarariman (white-collar professional
workers). One study participant consumed masculinised
drinks such as beer and whisky to redefine her identity:
by transgressing gendered drinking norms, she adopted
masculinised traits that enhanced her identity as a
(female) manager in charge of a male-dominated sales
team [23]. Similarly, Emslie et al. [21] described how
their participant ‘Madeline’ used masculinised drinking
practices (“playing the lad”) [21] when drinking with
male colleagues in defiance of gendered drinking norms.
The
authors
hypothesised
that
Madeline
used
the
counter-balancing resources of her class position to
“construct herself as (respectably) feminine” and legitim-
ise her ‘masculine’ drinking.
Participants in various studies used the learned aspects
of normative drinking to construct their identity. In
Emslie et al. [1], connoisseurship, namely the display of
learned knowledge and appreciation of (in this case) al-
coholic beverages, was used as a form of social capital in
establishing a cultured identity. By deploying knowledge
of wine and malt whisky, participants in two all-male
focus groups could “position themselves as ‘accom-
plished individuals’ in the social hierarchy through this
demonstration of taste and discernment” [1]. By contrast,
in Holloway et al. [14] many respondents negotiated iden-
tities through a considered rejection of connoisseurship.
By declaring a preference for mid-range wines and simul-
taneously repudiating the label of aficionado, respondents
successfully navigated around the possibility of being seen
as pretentious while still accessing the cultural capital as-
sociated with wine consumption [14].
Group identities were also constructed through how
individuals learnt to drink. In Nesvåg and Duckert [20],
the “knowledge and communication” of various charac-
teristics of alcoholic drinks were strongly tied to a
continental European cultural ideal valued by the man-
agement of an oil company. This company norm and
identity then influenced the drinking behaviours of
individuals, with contrary behaviours (e.g. obviously
succumbing to drunkenness) being minimised and/or
denied by individual workers [20].
Limitations
Most papers we reviewed reported studies carried out in
the Anglosphere (predominantly the United Kingdom),
possibly because of our inclusion requirement that pub-
lications be in English. Thus, our findings may not have
captured all research around middle-aged drinking and
may be limited in cross-cultural applicability.
Several reviewed papers shared authorship or a data
source. We regarded papers from the Drinking Attitudes
in Midlife (DrAM) study [1, 16, 17, 21] as closely linked
to one another due to the common data pool, author-
ship, methods, and theoretical perspective. Two papers
examining the geographies of alcohol featuring common
authorship, data, topic, and lens of inquiry [14, 22] were
moderately linked to one another. Another two papers
[15, 18] we regarded as slightly linked to one another
due to significant overlap in authorship.
Discussion
Alcohol drinking and non-drinking is a complex social
process that is influenced by a variety of factors and
deeply embedded in the social environment. Based on
the literature, we have articulated five themes that ex-
plain how non-problematised middle-aged drinkers con-
struct their drinking. Participants in reviewed studies
distinguished
between
acceptable
and
unacceptable
drinking practices in nuanced ways to produce their ver-
sion of normative drinking. Normative drinking was in-
fluenced by play, gender, identity, and learning to drink,
as well as by interactions between these concepts.
Our results offer insights into how public health mes-
sages about the health effects of alcohol consumption
may be received by middle-aged non-problematised
drinkers, and the barriers that may prevent this group
from receiving and acting on these messages. In Ling et
Muhlack et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:1016

 al. [15], public health messages were subordinated to
subjective experience in individuals’ determinations of
healthy drinking behaviours. In Holloway et al. [14] and
Emslie et al. [1], competing discourses of alcohol and
health allowed alternative definitions of healthy behav-
iour. In Brierley-Jones et al. [18], health messages were
rejected entirely, replaced instead by a fatalistic view of
health. Collectively, these findings suggest that, for
middle-aged drinkers, what makes drinking safe and ac-
ceptable is determined by whether the drinker can still
meet responsibilities and adhere to socially expected
models of behaviour. This suggests that the principal
barrier to reductions in alcohol consumption is not the
lack of information about health risks. The drinkers in
these studies were aware of public health messages, but
drew upon alternative narratives to reframe their behav-
iours in ways that minimised or dismissed personal risk.
Health was either described as a minor concern or not
considered at all.
We have shown how participants maintain their status
as non-problematised drinkers partly by setting bound-
aries around drinking behaviours and adhering to certain
norms. There are some parallels between these practices
and the normalisation of substance abuse by drug users.
For example, “non-problem” drug use is normalised
[26–28] and “otherwise law-abiding citizens have collect-
ively socially reconstructed an illegal act” when consider-
ing the distribution of drugs among networks. [29]
Drinkers and drug users employ similar strategies to en-
sure that they remain on the “right” side of the line de-
marcating problem behaviours: they ensure that the
physical environment minimises physical risk [30] and
they distance their own (potentially problematic) actions
from those of the problematic (be it binge drinker or
drug dealer) [28]. It is the identity which determines
problematisation, rather than the behaviour. If one is
not a binge drinker or a drug dealer, then one’s drinking
or one’s drug use is not problematic. The similarities
between these two groups may provide a broader un-
derstanding of the ways in which non-problematised
drinkers
approach
their
drinking
and
associated
behaviours.
Several themes in this paper may be helpful when for-
mulating interventions to limit or moderate alcohol con-
sumption. Narratives of unacceptable drinking practices
may be useful in framing public health messaging of
relevance to this demographic. For example, public
health strategies can focus on meeting responsibilities to
others, the possibility of causing harm to others, the re-
quirement for respectability in drinking, the physical
limits of ageing bodies and subsequent physical conse-
quences, and gendered expectations of behaviour. One
example of a campaign using notions of respectability
and behaviour appropriate to one’s age and stage of life
is the Motor Accident Commission of South Australia’s
“Drink Driving—Grow Up” campaign, which relies on
notions of moderate drinking being respectable, and ex-
cessive drinking being inappropriate for mature adults,
when it suggests that drink-driving is ‘childish’ behaviour
by using child actors in adult roles [31].
How people define themselves as drinkers—their iden-
tities—can also be used in public health campaigns.
Some identities, such as the connoisseur and the “real
ale drinker,” are closely tied to consumption—without
consumption, the identity does not exist. However, these
specific identities are concerned with a specific type of
drinking, rather than with consuming a lot of alcohol.
These identities could be framed in ways that reject
higher levels of consumption and emphasise quality over
quantity in consumption. There is a danger, however,
that this message of gaining social capital through mod-
erate drinking could be exploited. For example, the
DrinkWise “Drinking: Do It Properly” campaign was
promoted as influencing “young adults (18-24) to drink
responsibly – by moderating the intensity and frequency
of binge drinking occasions” [32]. However, the cam-
paign received strong criticism as promoting drinking,
rather than moderation in drinking [33, 34].
It is also possible for the themes we have identified in
this paper to be used in public health campaigns in eth-
ically problematic ways. For example, the use of gen-
dered
public
health
messaging
to
encourage
or
discourage particular modes of consumption is problem-
atic, since many of the gendered drinking norms are
closely tied to traditional and potentially oppressive no-
tions of masculinity and femininity. For example, the
“Think Twice” campaign of Balance (the North East UK
Alcohol Office) and Breakthrough Breast Cancer in-
cluded an image of two glasses of rosé swirled to resem-
ble a woman’s cleavage. [35] This image relies on a
gendered form of alcohol consumption, which may, in
turn, reinforce wider gender stereotypes.
In contrast to this, the DrinkWise “Kids Absorb your
Drinking” campaign [36] used parental identity and the
learned nature of alcohol consumption. We demon-
strated that drinking norms for parents are gendered,
with the assumption that women undertake the bulk of
childcare and domestic responsibilities. This campaign
avoided gendered expectations of parental responsibility
by invoking the father-son relationship. In this way, the
campaign did not exploit traditionally gendered parent-
ing roles while still using themes of normative drinking
in a way that challenged drinking behaviours. It is im-
portant to note, however, that relying upon a traditional
educational model of intervention is insufficient; as
noted, messages tended to be subordinated according to
drinkers’ own experiences. In this regard, it may be more
useful to use these findings to shape and influence

 public debate to bring about legislative and regulatory
changes that create a safer drinking culture. This has
been
done
to
great
effect
with
tobacco,
another
non-problematised substance that was denormalized and
problematised as part of an ongoing campaign to reduce
lung cancer. However, caution is advised in denormalising
and problematising. Ethical issues around the potential for
stigmatisation, seen in tobacco smokers, must be consid-
ered when implementing campaigns such as this so that we
do not unacceptably cause harm in our search to do good.
Conclusion
For middle-aged non-problematised drinkers, alcohol
drinking and non-drinking is a complex social process
that is influenced by a variety of factors and deeply em-
bedded in the social environment. We found that
middle-aged drinkers constructed their alcohol con-
sumption within a framework of Normative Drinking.
This key concept was expressed through the four inter-
related themes of Gender, Play, Identity, and Learning to
Drink. Normative drinking was also used to offer alter-
native interpretations of gender and identity.
Concerns about health and healthy behaviour, how-
ever, were either minor or non-existent. For these
drinkers, alcohol was both a tool for relaxation described
by learned norms of behaviour around gender and iden-
tity, and a means by which the self could be expressed
through deliberate adherence to and rejection of those
norms. This offers possible narrative frameworks for
public health interventions around alcohol consumption,
although care must be taken to ensure that ethically
problematic issues around gender and identity are
considered.
