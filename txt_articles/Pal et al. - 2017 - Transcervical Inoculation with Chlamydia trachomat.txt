ABSTRACT
Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of infection-induced infertil-
ity in women. Attempts to control this epidemic with screening programs and anti-
biotic therapy have failed. Currently, a vaccine to prevent C. trachomatis infections is
not available. In order to develop an animal model for evaluating vaccine antigens
that can be applied to humans, we used C. trachomatis serovar D (strain UW-3/Cx)
to induce infertility in mice whose major histocompatibility complex class II antigen
was replaced with the human leukocyte antigen DR4 (HLA-DR4). Transcervical inocu-
lation of medroxyprogesterone-treated HLA-DR4 transgenic mice with 5 � 105 C.
trachomatis D inclusion forming units (IFU) induced a significant reduction in fertility,
with a mean number of embryos/mouse of 4.4 � 1.3 compared to 7.8 � 0.5 for the
uninfected control mice (P � 0.05). A similar fertility reduction was elicited in the
wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice (4.3 � 1.4 embryos/mouse) compared to the levels of
the WT controls (9.1 � 0.4 embryos/mouse) (P � 0.05). Following infection, WT mice
mounted more robust humoral and cellular immune responses than HLA-DR4 mice.
As determined by vaginal shedding, HLA-DR4 mice were more susceptible to a tran-
scervical C. trachomatis D infection than WT mice. To assess if HLA-DR4 transgenic
and WT mice could be protected by vaccination, 104 IFU of C. trachomatis D was de-
livered intranasally, and mice were challenged transcervically 6 weeks later with 5 �
105 IFU of C. trachomatis D. As determined by severity and length of vaginal shed-
ding, WT C57BL/6 and HLA-DR4 mice were significantly protected by vaccination.
The advantages and limitations of the HLA-DR4 transgenic mouse model for evaluat-
ing human C. trachomatis vaccine antigens are discussed.

C
hlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection
(1, 2). If left untreated, C. trachomatis can ascend to the endometrium, reach the
fallopian tubes, and cause upper genital tract pathology, including tubal factor infer-
tility (3–7). Since C. trachomatis infections can be asymptomatic, it may be difficult to
determine to whom and when antibiotic treatment should be given (1, 8). Thus, an
effective means of reducing or eliminating C. trachomatis-induced infertility is vaccina-
tion (9–13). Unfortunately, there is still no licensed C. trachomatis vaccine for humans.
Efforts to develop a human vaccine against C. trachomatis ocular infection were
initiated more than 100 years ago (14–19). However, whole-organism-based vaccines
induced only short-lived immunity and, in some cases, even exacerbated ocular pa-
thology upon reexposure to C. trachomatis (20, 21). The failure of the human vaccine
trials stimulated the search for a subunit vaccine to prevent genital tract infection using
the Chlamydia muridarum mouse model (11, 12). C. muridarum infection of the mouse
genital tract can induce infertility similar to that observed in women following a

 C. trachomatis infection (22–24). As a result, several protective antigens from C. muri-
darum have been identified (11, 25–28). However, the homologous C. trachomatis
antigens have not been evaluated due to lack of a convenient model for induction of
infertility. It is known that intravaginal inoculation with C. trachomatis, a procedure
closest to natural infection, fails to cause tubal pathology, partly due to the ability of the
innate immune response in the lower genital tract of the mouse to rapidly eliminate
human chlamydial organisms (29). To address this limitation, Carmichael et al. (30) used
an intrabursal inoculation model to compare different C. trachomatis serovars for their
ability to induce infertility in C3H/HeN mice pretreated with medroxyprogesterone.
These authors found that C. trachomatis serovar D caused a significant reduction in
fertility. The intrabursal inoculation model, however, involves survival surgery and
bypasses both the cervical barrier and the endometrial lumen where vaccine-induced
immunity may localize. Interestingly, it has been shown that transcervical inoculation
with C. trachomatis, a procedure that does not involve surgery but still bypasses the
cervical barrier, can cause both infection and inflammation in the mouse upper genital
tract (31). This inoculation route has recently been used for evaluating the efficacy of
an inactivated C. trachomatis vaccine to protect the genital tract of mice against
infection and inflammatory pathology (32). However, it remains unclear whether tran-
scervical inoculation with C. trachomatis serovar D can induce infertility. Addressing this
question may allow us to develop a model for evaluating whether a human C.
trachomatis vaccine can preserve the reproductive function of the mouse genital tract.
In the current study, we tested whether transcervical inoculation with C. trachomatis
D could induce infertility in mice whose major histocompatibility complex class II
(MHC-II) antigen is replaced with the human leukocyte antigen DR4 (HLA-DR4). These
mice have already been utilized to identify CD4� T-cell epitopes in several microor-
ganisms and human tumor-associated antigens and in vaccination studies (28, 33–36).
Since both the C. trachomatis vaccine antigens and the MHC-II antigen are of human
origin, the vaccine antigens identified in this model should be applicable to humans.
We found that transcervical inoculation of medroxyprogesterone-treated HLA-DR4
transgenic mice with 5 � 105 inclusion forming units (IFU) of C. trachomatis D (strain
UW-3/Cx) induced a significant reduction in fertility, and a similar reduction was also
elicited in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, the transcervical inoculation-
induced infertility correlated with enhanced recovery of C. trachomatis D from the
mouse genital tract and robust systemic lymphocyte responsiveness but limited levels
of serum neutralization antibodies. In addition, intranasal immunization of HLA-DR4
and WT mice with live C. trachomatis D elementary bodies (EBs) elicited similar levels
of protection against a transcervical challenge in both strains of mice. In conclusion,
transcervical inoculation with C. trachomatis D in HLA-DR4 mice can be a useful model
for evaluating human C. trachomatis vaccines.
RESULTS
Transcervical inoculation with C. trachomatis D significantly reduces fertility in
HLA-DR4 and WT mice. As shown in Table 1, the mean number of embryos in both
uterine horns of HLA-DR4 mice was significantly different between the transcervically
C. trachomatis D-infected (4.4 � 1.3 embryos/mouse) and the fertility control (7.8 � 0.5
embryos/mouse) group (P � 0.05). The number of embryos in the right uterine horns
was also significantly different between the two groups (P � 0.05). The transcervical
inoculation-induced infertility was also observed in WT C57BL/6 mice. In infected mice
the mean number of embryos/mouse was 4.3 � 1.4 while the fertility control mice had
9.1 � 0.4 embryos/mouse (P � 0.05). The numbers of embryos in the right and left
uterine horns were also significantly different between the two groups (P � 0.05).
HLA-DR4 mice are more susceptible to C. trachomatis D transcervical infection
than WT animals. Vaginal cultures for C. trachomatis D were collected twice a week for
the first 4 weeks and once a week for two additional weeks for a total of 10 cultures/
mouse (Fig. 1A and B). All mice infected transcervically had positive cultures as early as
day 4 postinoculation. Some HLA-DR4 mice continued to shed for the 43 days of

 observation while WT mice stopped by day 35. Of the 100 vaginal cultures collected,
75% (75/100) from the HLA-DR4 mice were positive for C. trachomatis D while only 38%
(38/100) from the WT C57BL/6 mice were positive (P � 0.05) (Fig. 2A). The total
numbers of C. trachomatis D IFU recovered were also significantly different between the
HLA-DR4 (289,316 IFU) and WT (8,925 IFU) mice (P � 0.05) (Fig. 2B). In addition, the
mean time (days) to negative cultures was significantly different between the HLA-DR4
(37 � 3 days) and WT (23 � 3 days) mice (P � 0.05) (Fig. 2C). Using Wilcoxon’s rank-sum
test to compare the areas under the curve (AUC), the vaginal shedding was significantly
different between the two groups (59,324 versus 1,478 arbitrary units; P � 0.05) (Fig. 1A
and B).
Characterization of the immune responses following C. trachomatis D transcer-
vical infection. To monitor antibody responses, blood was collected from all mice at 42
days post-transcervical infection. As shown in Fig. 3A, WT C56BL/6 mice had higher IgG
antibody titers than the HLA-DR4 animals. At day 42, the transcervically infected WT
mice had a C. trachomatis D-specific IgG geometric mean titer (GMT) of 67,559 (range,
25,600 to 204,800) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) while the HLA-DR4
mice had a GMT of 9,701 (range, 6,400 to 12,800) (P � 0.05).
The IgG2c/IgG1 ratio was used to monitor the bias toward a Th1 phenotype (Fig. 3A)
(37). Based on this ratio, the WT C57BL/6 mice (IgG2c/IgG1 � 58,813/696, or 84) had
more Th1-biased responses than HLA-DR4 mice (2,786/919, or 3). The HLA-DR4 mice
also displayed reduced titers of serum IgM (115; range �100 to 400) and IgA (303;
range, �100 to 1,600) than WT mice (for IgM, 303 [range, �100 to 400]; for IgA, 1,393
[range, 400 to 6,400]) although these differences were not statistically significant. The
IgG antibody titers in the vaginal washes were also not significantly higher in WT (127;
range, 80 to 160) than in HLA-DR4 (20; range, 10 to 80) mice (P � 0.05).
The serum antibodies were further evaluated for their ability to neutralize C.
trachomatis D infectivity in vitro (Fig. 3A). HLA-DR4 mice had a lower neutralizing GMT
(44; range, �10 to 160) than WT (452; range, 200 to 1,600) mice, which correlates with
both the reduced fertility and prolonged shedding (P � 0.05).
Western blotting was performed with serum samples collected before infection and
at day 42 post-transcervical infection. As shown in Fig. 4 (lanes 6 and 7), HLA-DR4 mice
had weaker antibody responses than WT mice following transcervical infection. HLA-
DR4 serum reacted with a band in the molecular mass range of 60 kDa, likely
corresponding to the 60-kDa cysteine-rich protein and/or the 60-kDa heat shock
protein, and a band corresponding to the major outer membrane protein (MOMP; 42
kDa). The WT mice, on the other hand, had antibodies to other proteins, including
proteins of �150-kDa (probably polymorphic membrane proteins), an �26-kDa pro-
tein, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suggesting that the humanization of the C57BL/6
mice with MHC-II quantitatively and qualitatively affected antibody responses.
Lymphoproliferative T-cell responses were determined at day 42 following transcer-
vical infection (Fig. 3B). As in the case of the humoral immune responses, more robust
T-cell responses were measured in T cells from WT mice stimulated with C. trachomatis
D EBs than in those of HLA-DR4 animals. The value in WT mice was 10,259 � 952 cpm

sal vaccination. To determine if protective immune responses could be elicited by
vaccination, naive mice were inoculated intranasally with 104 IFU of C. trachomatis D
and challenged transcervically 4 weeks later. Antibody responses following intranasal
immunization were evaluated in blood and vaginal washes. Similar to results following
transcervical inoculation, WT mice developed more robust antibody responses than
HLA-DR4 animals (Fig. 5A). For example, at day 28 postimmunization, the IgG GMT in
WT mice was 204,800 (range, 204,800 to 204,800) while in HLA-DR4 mice it was 36,204
(range, 25,600 to 51,200) (P � 0.05). The IgG2c/IgG1 ratio was also higher in WT mice
(IgG2c/IgG1 � 144,815/2,263, or 64) than in HLA-DR4 animals (12,800/800, or 16). The
IgA GMT in serum was also higher in WT than in HLA-DR4 mice. No IgM was detected
in serum. Serum neutralizing titers were higher in WT mice (566; range, 100 to 3,200)
than in HLA-DR4 mice (25; range, 25 to 25) (P � 0.05). Levels of IgG and IgA in vaginal
washes were also lower in HLA-DR4 mice than those of the WT animals but were not
statistically different (P � 0.05).
Western blotting performed with serum samples from WT mice vaccinated intrana-
sally with C. trachomatis D showed broader immune responses than samples from
HLA-DR4 mice (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). Serum from WT mice recognized bands with

T-cell proliferative responses to C. trachomatis D EBs were also more robust in WT
than in HLA-DR4 intranasally immunized animals (Fig. 5B). The level in WT mice reached
11,243 � 1,358 cpm while that in HLA-DR4 was 5,885 � 313 cpm (P � 0.05). In contrast,
T cells from HLA-DR4 mice stimulated with ConA responded more strongly than those
from WT mice (108,046 � 3,116 cpm for HLA-DR4 versus 35,706 � 2,182 cpm for WT
mice) (P � 0.05). Levels of IFN-� in EB-stimulated T-cell supernatants were 11,063 �
1,385 pg/ml for WT mice and 7,790 � 619 pg/ml for HLA-DR4 mice (P � 0.1). Levels
of IL-17 in supernatants were higher in the HLA-DR4 (455 � 51 pg/ml) than in the

strains.

 more striking for the HLA-DR4 than for the WT mice probably, at least in part, because
the HLA-DR4 mice were more susceptible to transcervical infection. For example, 75%
(75/100) of the vaginal cultures of the nonvaccinated HLA-DR4 mice were positive, but
only 30% (25/80) of cultures from the immunized group were positive (Fig. 2A) (P �

clearance were also significantly different (Fig. 2B and C) (P � 0.05). This difference
between immunized and nonimmunized HLA-DR4 mice is very apparent when areas
under the curve are compared (2,373 versus 59,324 arbitrary units; P � 0.05) (Fig. 1A
and C).
A direct comparison of protection achieved between the two vaccinated strains of
mice shows that similar protection levels were elicited in WT and HLA-DR4 mice. As
shown in Fig. 1C and D, all but one HLA-DR4 mouse had positive cultures on day 4
postchallenge in contrast to 5 of 8 WT mice with negative cultures, with HLA-DR4 mice
having a median (range) number of IFU shed of 389 (�2 to 3,654) versus 9 (�2 to 185)
for WT mice (P � 0.05). Between the HLA-DR4 and the WT immunized mice significant
differences were observed in the percentages of mice with positive cultures (30%
[24/80] of HLA-DR4 and 14% [11/80] of WT mice), total number of IFU shed (10,268 and

 DISCUSSION
In the current study, we demonstrated that transcervical inoculation with C. tracho-
matis D reduces fertility in HLA-DR4 transgenic mice. Importantly, the transcervical
inoculation-induced infertility was reproduced in the WT C57BL/6 mice, which both
validates the reproducibility of the model and suggests that the infertility is not
associated with either a mouse strain or a human MHC class II haplotype. The latter
finding is consistent with previous observations made in the C. muridarum mouse
model revealing that it is the CD8�, but not CD4�, T-cell response that plays a critical
role in promoting infertility (38). Indeed, both human and mouse data suggest that
protective immunity is more likely MHC class II restricted and CD4� T cell dependent
(28, 39–41). Thus, an HLA-DR4-restricted C. trachomatis antigen that shows protection
in the HLA-DR4 mouse model is unlikely to exacerbate pathology in humans. In
addition we showed that intranasal immunization with live C. trachomatis D protects
both strains of mice against a transcervical challenge.
The C. trachomatis-induced infertility caused by transcervical inoculation of HLA-DR4
mice paralleled extensive organism recovery from vaginal cultures and also correlated with
dampened cellular and humoral immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies. The
question is whether vaccine antigen-primed neutralization antibody responses can be
recalled to control the extensive number of live organisms in genital tissues, a premise
testable in this model. WT C57BL/6 mice are known to possess a strong bias toward the Th1
phenotype (42–44). Interestingly, our current study revealed that replacing the mouse MHC
class II antigens with the human HLA-DR4 attenuated the extreme Th1 bias, which may
render the HLA-DR4 mice more suitable for screening vaccine antigens for susceptible
humans. The previous success in inducing protective cellular immunity against C. muri-
darum infection in the genital tract of HLA-DR4 mice with proteins that are highly con-
served in both C. trachomatis and C. muridarum suggests that the HLA-DR4 mice are
suitable for evaluating T-cell antigens for vaccine development (28).
Transcervical infection bypasses the cervical barrier that may represent a critical site
where the vaccine antigen-induced immunity develops. Therefore, this model may miss
vaccine formulations that induce immunity against ascending infection. This concern can
be addressed by monitoring the descending infection. Vaccine-induced cervical immunity
should be able to prevent both ascending and descending infection. By monitoring live
organisms in vaginal swabs after transcervical inoculation, we can still determine whether
a given vaccine antigen is able to induce anti-ascending/descending immunity in this
model. Indeed, here we also showed that intranasal immunization with live C. trachomatis
D induces immunity that significantly reduces descent of transcervically inoculated C.
trachomatis organisms into the lower genital tract, confirming previous results (32).
Although the numbers of IFU, testing times, and Depo-Provera treatments differed
for the intranasal and transcervical inoculations with C. trachomatis D, similar humoral
and cellular immune responses were observed in both strains of mice. However, more
robust immune responses were obtained in WT than in HLA-DR4 mice independently
of the route of inoculation. Antibody titers in serum and vaginal washes were quite
high in both strains of mice. Based on the IgG2c/IgG1 ratio in serum and IFN-� levels
in supernatants from T cells stimulated with C. trachomatis D EBs, both routes elicited
Th1-biased immune responses consistent with the Th1 bias of C57BL/6 mice (42–44).
Interestingly, T-cell proliferative responses, using ConA for stimulation in contrast to
using C. trachomatis D EBs, were higher in HLA-DR4 mice than in WT mice, suggesting
that these mice do not have generalized weaker cell-mediated responses. Also, levels
of IL-17 in supernatants from EB-stimulated T cells were higher in HLA-DR4 mice than
in WT animals. IL-17 is thought to play a critical role in the generation of Th1 immunity
and the induction of memory immune responses, and, therefore, it is important in
Chlamydia-elicited vaccine immunity (45–47). These findings also suggest that HLA-DR4
mice may help elucidate immune mechanisms involved in vaccine-induced protection.
More work is necessary to reach definitive conclusions about the use of HLA-DR4
mice in vaccination studies. Interestingly, however, although the HLA-DR4 mice

 mounted weaker immune responses to live C. trachomatis D, the protection levels
elicited by intranasal vaccination against transcervical challenge were equivalent in the
two strains of mice. For example, using the AUC as a parameter to determine protection
against vaginal shedding, the HLA-DR4 mice had a decrease of 25-fold (59,324/2,373
arbitrary units) while the WT mice had a decrease of 2-fold (1,478/689 arbitrary units).
It could be argued that the AUC is still 3.4 (2,373/689 arbitrary units) higher in HLA-DR4
than in WT mice, but an apparent higher susceptibility to infection, and not weaker
protective immune responses, may account for that difference.
It is recognized that although DR4 (beta chain allele, DRB*0401) is a common
haplotype of MHC class II (MHC-II) in humans, the DR4-selected antigens may not work
in individuals who lack DR4. This concern is alleviated by the fact that immunodomi-
nant antigens selected by DR4 likely contain multiple epitopes recognized by other
MHC-II haplotypes. In addition, the incorporation of multiple antigens into a vaccine
will increase human MHC-II recognition frequency (11). Finally, the DR4-selected anti-
gens could also be analyzed in mice expressing other human MHC-II alleles associated
with normal fertility after chlamydial infection, such as DQA*0501 or DQB*0402 (48).
The antigens presentable by multiple MHC-II haplotypes should be prioritized for
incorporation into C. trachomatis vaccines.
In summary, transcervical inoculation with C. trachomatis D significantly reduced
fertility in HLA-DR4 transgenic and WT C57BL/6 mice. Based on the number of positive
vaginal cultures, the number of IFU recovered, and time to clearance, HLA-DR4 mice
were more susceptible than WT mice to a C. trachomatis D transcervical infection.
Furthermore, as determined by vaginal shedding, intranasal immunization of HLA-DR4
and WT C57BL/6 mice with live C. trachomatis D protected against a transcervical
challenge with this organism. This novel animal model opens new opportunities to test
subunit vaccine antigens that can potentially be used in humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
C. trachomatis D stocks. C. trachomatis D (strain UW-3/Cx) was obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and was grown in HeLa-229 cells using Eagle’s minimal essential
medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (49). Density gradient-purified EBs were stored
at �80°
C in 0.2 M sucrose, 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), and 5 mM glutamic acid (SPG medium)
(50). Bacterial stocks were titrated in HeLa-229 cells.
Transcervical infection and intranasal vaccination of mice. Six-week-old female WT and trans-
genic C57BL/6 mice [B6.129S2-H2Abtm1Gru Tg (HLA-DRA/H2-Ea, HLA-DRB1*0401/H2-Eb)1Kito; model
4149F] were purchased from Taconic Biosciences, Inc., and housed at the University of California, Irvine
(UCI), vivarium (28). For transcervical infection, mice were anesthetized and inoculated with 5 � 105 IFU
of C. trachomatis D via the cervical os by using a nonsurgical embryo transfer device (ParaTechs Corp.,
Lexington, KY) (28). Four days prior to transcervical infection, mice were treated subcutaneously with 2
mg of Depo-Provera (Pfizer).
To determine if HLA-DR4 and WT mice can be protected by vaccination, 104 IFU of C. trachomatis D
was delivered intranasally, and Depo-Provera-treated mice were challenged transcervically 4 weeks later
with C. trachomatis D (5 � 105 IFU).
Immunoassays. Blood was drawn from the periorbital region, and genital secretions were collected
by washing the vagina twice with 20 �l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). C. trachomatis D-specific
antibody titers were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as previously
described (51). Briefly, multiwell plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) were coated overnight with
1 �g of purified C. trachomatis D EBs per well, and serial dilutions of samples were added. The
antigen-antibody reactions were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse
antibodies. The following antibodies were utilized: IgG, IgM, and IgA (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories,
Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), IgG1 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), and IgG2c (Jackson Immuno Research,
West Grove, PA). The substrate, 2,2=-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic) acid, was used for color
development. The plates were scanned at 405 nm in an ELISA reader (Labsystem Multiscan, Helsinki,
Finland). Titers were calculated after subtracting the optical density (OD) �2 standard deviations (SD) of
preinfected mouse samples.
Western blotting was performed with C. trachomatis D EBs as previously described (52, 53). Following
transfer of the proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane, nonspecific binding was blocked, and the serum
samples were added and incubated overnight. The membrane was washed and incubated with horse-
radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig antibody followed by visualization of the bands by the
addition of hydrogen peroxide and 4-chloro-1-naphthol.
In vitro neutralization assays were performed as published by Peterson et al. (49). Briefly, 1 � 104 IFU
of C. trachomatis D was added to serial dilutions of mouse serum made with Ca2�- and Mg2�-free PBS,
pH 7.2, and supplemented with 5% guinea pig serum. After incubation for 45 min at 37°
C, the mixture

 was inoculated by centrifugation into HeLa-229 cells grown on shell vials. Following 40 h of incubation
at 37°
C, the monolayers were fixed and stained with a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to C. trachomatis
MOMP (MAb E4) (54). The titer of a sample was the dilution that yielded 50% neutralization relative to
neutralization of the control serum from naive mice.
A T-cell lymphoproliferative assay (LPA) was performed at week 7 postinfection using splenocytes, as
previously described (52). In short, splenic T cells were collected, and UV-inactivated C. trachomatis D EBs
were added at a concentration of 1 EB to 1 T cell plus antigen-presenting cell (APC). APCs were prepared
by irradiating splenocytes with 3,300 rads of 137Cs. Negative-control wells received medium alone, and
positive controls received concanavalin A (5 �g/ml). At 96 h of incubation, cell proliferation was
measured by addition of 1 �Ci of [methyl-3H]thymidine (47 Ci/mmol; Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL)
per well. The mean count was obtained from triplicate cultures.
Levels of IFN-�, IL-4, and IL-17 were determined, using a commercial kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA), in supernatants from splenic T cells stimulated as described above (55).
Genital cultures. Following the genital challenge, vaginal swabs were cultured twice weekly for the
first 4 weeks and then at 7-day intervals for an additional 2 weeks (52). HeLa-229 cells grown in 48-well
tissue culture plates were inoculated with 10-fold dilutions of the vaginal swab cultures and incubated
for 40 h at 37°
C. The monolayers were fixed with methanol, and chlamydial inclusions were stained using
MAb E4 as described above. The limit of detection was 2 IFU/mouse/culture.
Fertility studies. At 7 weeks following C. trachomatis D transcervical inoculation, mice were caged
with male WT C57BL/6 mice, and pregnancy was determined by weighing the animals. Mice that gained
weight were euthanized, and the number of embryos in each uterine horn was counted. Mice that did
not become pregnant were caged again with a different male mouse that had fathered a litter during the
first mating (52). Two groups of noninfected mice, of the same age as those infected, were used as
fertility controls. The numbers of embryos in both uterine horns were counted.
Statistics. A two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test, a Mann-Whitney rank U test, a Wilcoxon matched-
pairs signed-rank test, and Fisher’s exact test were used for statistical analyses with the program
SigmaStat, version 3.5. Differences were considered significant for P values of �0.05 (a P value of �0.1
was noted in a few analyses to indicate a trend to significance).
