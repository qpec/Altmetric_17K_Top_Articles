Anti-retroviral therapy successfully suppresses HIV-1 infection, but fails to provide a cure. During infection Type
1 IFNs normally play an essential role in viral clearance, but in vivo IFN-α only has a modest impact on HIV-1 in-
fection, suggesting its possible targeting by HIV. Here, we report that the HIV protein, Vif, inhibits effective IFN-α
signalling via degradation of essential JAK/STAT pathway components. We found that STAT1 and STAT3 are spe-
cifically reduced in HEK293T cells expressing Vif and that full length, infectious HIV-1 IIIB strain promotes their
degradation in a Vif-dependent manner. HIV-1 IIIB infection of myeloid ThP-1 cells also reduced the IFN-α-me-
diated induction of the anti-viral gene, ISG15, but not MxA, revealing a functional consequence of this HIV-1-me-
diated immune evasion strategy. Interestingly, while total STAT levels were not reduced upon in vitro IIIB
infection of primary human PBMCs, IFN-α-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 and ISG induction
were starkly reduced, with removal of Vif (IIIBΔVif), partially restoring pSTATs, ISG15 and MxB induction. Simi-
larly, pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 expression and IFN-α-induced ISG15 were reduced in PBMCs from HIV-infected pa-
tients, compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, IFN-α pre-treatment of a CEM T lymphoblast cells
significantly inhibited HIV infection/replication (measured by cellular p24), only in the absence of Vif (IIIBΔVif),
but was unable to suppress full length IIIB infection. When analysing the mechanism by which Vif might target
the JAK/STAT pathway, we found Vif interacts with both STAT1 and STAT3, (but not STAT2), and its expression
promotes ubiquitination and MG132-sensitive, proteosomal degradation of both proteins. Vif's Elongin-Cullin-
SOCS-box binding motif enables the formation of an active E3 ligase complex, which we found to be required
for Vif's degradation of STAT1 and STAT3. In fact, the E3 ligase scaffold proteins, Cul5 and Rbx2, were also
found to be essential for Vif-mediated proteasomal degradation of STAT1 and STAT3. These results reveal a target
for HIV-1-Vif and demonstrate how HIV-1 impairs the anti-viral activity of Type 1 IFNs, possibly explaining why
both endogenous and therapeutic IFN-α fail to activate more effective control over HIV infection.

1. Introduction
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a major global
health challenge, with over 40 million people infected worldwide
(Mayer and Beyrer, 2007). Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses
HIV-1 replication (Potthoff and Brockmeyer, 2010), but a drug that
fully clears infection remains undiscovered. Lifelong ART is costly and
brings with it issues of adherence, side-effects and mutational resis-
tance (Reust, 2011), highlighting the remaining need for new therapeu-
tic strategies to cure HIV. Harnessing endogenous anti-viral immune
responses provides a possible alternative for therapeutic discovery.
Type 1 Interferons (IFNs), such as IFN-α, upregulate IFN Stimulated
Genes (ISGs), that exert a broad range of anti-viral effector functions.
The anti-viral mechanisms of several ISGs are well documented, in
fact, by blocking the IFN-I receptor of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus
(SIV)-infected rhesus macaques, Sandler et al., eloquently highlighted
the importance of Type I IFNs for anti-viral gene expression, suppression
of viral reservoir and control of CD4 T-cell depletion (Sandler et al.,
2014). ISGs suppress HIV replication at multiple stages of the viral
lifecycle (Doyle et al., 2015), but therapeutic trials of exogenous IFN-α
have had surprisingly weak clinical response, with suppression of viral
load poorly sustained (Lane, 1991, Bosinger and Utay, 2015, Asmuth et
al., 2010). Therefore, we hypothesised that, as with other viruses
(Elliott et al., 2007; Stevenson et al., 2013; Ulane et al., 2003), HIV may
promote the degradation of Type 1 IFN Janus Kinase/Signal Transducers

 and Activators of Transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway compo-
nents, thus explaining the block in anti-viral ISG induction and HIV's
in vivo resistance to IFN-α.
During infection viruses are detected by Pattern Recognition Recep-
tors (PRRs) that induce Type I IFN production (Perry et al., 2005). Type I
IFNs bind to the Type I IFN Receptor (IFNAR) and signal through the JAK/
STAT pathway (Haller et al., 2006). IFN-α receptor engagement specifi-
cally results in tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and Tyrosine Kinase
(Tyk)2 (Colamonici et al., 1994; Shuai et al., 1993), leading to receptor
phosphorylation and recruitment of STAT proteins (Platanias, 2005),
which, when activated, dissociate from the receptor and form homo-
or hetero-dimers that translocate to the nucleus. Type I IFNs classically
signal via a trimer of STAT1, STAT2 and IFN Regulatory Factor (IRF)9,
called the IFN-Stimulated Gene Factor (ISGF)3. Upon translocation to
the nucleus, the ISGF3 complex binds IFN-Stimulated Response Ele-
ments (ISREs) (Levy et al., 1988) and promotes the induction of N500
ISGs (de Veer et al., 2001; Der et al., 1998a).
In this study we analysed the effects of HIV-1-Vif upon the expres-
sion of three well known, but functionally different, ISGs: ISG15, MxA
and MxB. The ubiquitin like protein, ISG15, acts by targeting proteins
for proteasomal degradation (Zhao et al., 2013) and has been shown
to effectively inhibit the cellular release of the HIV-1 virion by inhibiting
the endosomal trafficking pathway (Okumura et al., 2006). Further-
more, ISG15 can inhibit the release of HIV virions from the plasma
membrane (Pincetic et al., 2010). Indeed, the expression of ISG15 is en-
hanced in CD4+ T cells of HIV-infected patients (Scagnolari et al., 2016)
and HIV-1-Gag protein is post-translationally conjugated with ISG15,
further highlighting its anti-viral importance (Woods et al., 2011).
MxA shares structural homology with the dynamin family of GTPases
and inhibits viral replication via physical formation of oligomeric rings
around viral nucleocapsids (Haller and Kochs, 2011). It is well docu-
mented to inhibit a broad range of viruses, including influenza A virus,
La Crosse encephalitis virus, bunyaviruses, phleboviruses, hantaviruses
and Hepatitis C and B Viruses (HCV and HBV) (Pavlovic et al., 1990;
Kochs et al., 2002; Frese et al., 1996; Gordien et al., 2001; Shi et al.,
2017; Stevenson et al., 2011), but its direct anti-viral function against
HIV-1 is not currently known. In contrast to MxA, MxB has been
shown to inhibit HIV viral infection (Goujon et al., 2013). MxB prevents
the nuclear import and integration of HIV-1 viral DNA and mutation of
HIV capsid protein attenuates MxB's inhibition of HIV-1 (Kane et al.,
2013; Liu et al., 2013).
Anti-viral ISGs provide Type I IFNs with an arsenal of weapons
against viral infection, however, viral immune evasion strategies have
evolved to block many of these immune mechanisms. We and others
have discovered that several viruses, including HCV (Stevenson et al.,
2013), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (Elliott et al., 2007), Mumps
(Ulane et al., 2003) Simian Virus 5 and Human Parainfluenza Virus
Type 2 (Andrejeva et al., 2002), use a conserved mechanism to promote
STAT proteasomal degradation, thus cutting the intracellular “lifeline” of
ISG induction. Given the strong anti-viral effects of IFN-α, it is not sur-
prising that diverse viral species have evolved this mechanism to inhibit
its JAK/STAT signalling pathway. In fact, these viruses “hijack” an immu-
noregulatory mechanism commonly used by Suppressor Of Cytokine
Signalling (SOCS) proteins to endogenously control JAK/STAT signalling
(Yoshimura et al., 2007). SOCS all share a conserved “SOCS box” motif,
which interacts with Elongin B, Elongin C, Cullin (Cul) and Ring box
(RBX) proteins, forming a functional Elongin-Cul-SOCS box (ECS) E3 li-
gase complex (Kamura et al., 2004). This ECS enzymatic complex catal-
yses the poly-ubiquitination of target proteins, such as JAK2, thus
marking them for degradation via the 26S proteasome (Kamizono et
al., 2001). The RSV protein, NS1, interacts with Elongin C and Cul2,
thereby forming an E3 ligase complex, which specifically targets
STAT2 for proteasomal degradation (Elliott et al., 2007). Similarly, Para-
myxovirus protein V complexes with DNA damage binding protein-1
(DDB1) and Cul4A, thus promoting STAT1 and STAT2 degradation
(Ulane and Horvath, 2002); while Mumps protein V promotes
degradation of STAT1, STAT2 and STAT3 via formation of a Cul4A-
DDB1-dependent E3 complex (Ulane et al., 2003). Furthermore, we re-
cently discovered that HCV also targets STAT1 and STAT3 for
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, revealing yet another
virus that suppresses anti-viral IFN-α signalling (Stevenson et al., 2013).
HIV-1 has evolved several mechanisms for disabling specific anti-
viral ISGs. While the powerful immune evasion strategies HIV-1-Vif
are clearly displayed by its ability to down-regulate APOBEC3 gene tran-
scription (Anderson and Harris, 2015), it also contains SOCS box-like
motifs that promote the formation of an ECS E3 ligase complex, which
ubiquitinates and promotes proteasomal degradation of APOBEC3G
protein (Sheehy et al., 2003; Kamura et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004).
Here, we report that the Vif-ECS also targets key components of the
IFN-α JAK/STAT pathway. We demonstrate that HIV-1-Vif associates
with STAT1 and STAT3 and promotes their ubiquitination and MG132-
reversible proteasomal degradation, which is reliant on the SOCS box
binding motifs of Vif and expression of the E3 ligase proteins, Cul5 and
RBX2. Interestingly, while several HIV immune evasion processes are
likely to be “at play” in vivo, compared to controls, we observed less
IFN-α-mediated STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and ISG induction
in PBMCs infected in vitro with HIV-1 IIIB and in PBMCs from HIV pa-
tients, highlighting a functional signalling reduction in this anti-viral
pathway. In fact, we also observed that T-lymphoblast cells pre-treated
with IFN-α were less resistant to infection with IIIBΔVif (measured by
p24 levels), than the WT IIIB clone, indicating that the presence of Vif
functionally inhibits IFN-α's anti-viral protection. Together, these find-
ings are an insight into the suppressive capabilities of HIV-1 on the
IFN-α JAK/STAT pathway and may even provide some explanation for
the failure of endogenous and therapeutic IFN-α to mediate control of
HIV-1 replication in patients.

 using Mirus TransIT-2020. HEK293T cells were also transfected with
constructs encoding Vif or VifΔSLQ and the corresponding empty
pMEP4 vector using Mirus TransIT-2020. 24 h post transfection the
cells were stimulated with 1 μM CdCl2 for 24 h. Huh7 cells were

fectious molecular clones. 48 h later virus containing supernatants were
removed. Supernatants from EV transfected cells were used for mock in-
fections. ThP-1, CEM cells or PBMCs were spinoculated with HIV YU-2,
HIV IIIB or IIIBΔVif at 1200g for 90 min at 25 °C.

(Dublin, Ireland) Joint Research Ethics Committee.
3. Results
3.1. STAT1 and STAT3 Protein Expression is Significantly Reduced Upon Ex-
pression of HIV-Vif
Since therapeutic IFN-α has only a modest impact on HIV-1 infection
(Lane, 1991), we wondered if the virus could block its anti-viral activity
by degrading components of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. Since
several viruses target STAT proteins for degradation and HIV-Vif de-
grades APOBEC3G, we initially investigated the effect of Vif upon
STAT1-3 protein levels. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected
with a DNA construct encoding HIV-Vif or the EV control. STAT1,
STAT2 and STAT3 proteins were measured by Western blotting and
quantified by densitometric analysis. Upon expression of Vif, STAT1
and STAT3 protein levels were significantly reduced, while STAT2
expression was unaffected (Fig. 1A–C). To determine if Vif degrades
“specific” proteins, we also analysed expression of the NF-κB subunit,
p65. As with STAT2, Vif had no significant effect on p65, indicating
targeted specificity (Fig. 1D).
Having observed a loss of STAT1 and STAT3 protein in the presence
of Vif, we next investigated whether their loss was mediated at the
transcriptional level. mRNA expression of STAT1-3 was quantified by
qRT-PCR in Vif transfected HEK293T cells. Vif had no significant effect
on the mRNA of STAT1-3 (Suppl. Fig. 1A), indicating that the reduction
of STAT1 and STAT3 protein was mediated at a post-translational
stage. Vif expression also significantly suppressed IFN-α-induced
pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 (Suppl. Fig. 1B), revealing a functional loss of nor-
mal IFN-α signalling the presence of Vif.
As an additional experimental means of Vif expression, we also sta-
bly transfected HEK293T cells with a CdCl2-inducible Vif construct.
Using this CdCl2-induction of Vif, we again observed a reduction of
205
S. Gargan et al. / EBioMedicine 30 (2018) 203–216
 STAT1 and STAT3 protein levels (Suppl. Fig. 2A–B and E–F) and IFN-α-
induced pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 (Suppl. Fig. 2A–D), providing further sup-
port for Vif's role in suppressing the anti-viral IFN-α pathway.
3.2. STAT1 and STAT3 Protein Expression is Significantly Reduced Upon Ex-
pression of Full Length HIV-1 IIIB, but not IIIBΔVif
Having observed a loss of STAT1 and STAT3 protein in the presence
of Vif, we next analysed STAT protein expression in cells expressing
the full length HIV IIIB infectious molecular clone or a IIIB version with
a 230 base pair deletion in the region coding for Vif (IIIBΔVif).
HEK293T cells were transfected with either of these HIV-1 clones before
STAT1, STAT2 and STAT3 protein expression was examined using im-
munoblotting. HIV expression was confirmed by assessing p24 levels,
using a p24 antibody (Simm et al., 1995). Expression of the full length
HIV IIIB infectious molecular clone significantly reduced STAT1 and
STAT3 protein levels, while STAT2 expression was not significantly af-
fected (Fig. 2A–C). However, neither STAT1 nor STAT3 protein levels
were significantly reduced in the absence of Vif (IIIBΔVif clone)
(Fig. 2A and C), again suggesting a role for Vif in their cellular reduction.
3.3. Infection of Myeloid ThP-1 Cells With HIV-1 Reduces STAT1 and STAT3
Protein Expression, Along With ISG15 Induction
Having observed a reduction of STAT1 and STAT3 protein in 293 T
cells transfected with Vif or the full length HIV IIIB clone, we next exam-
ined the effect of HIV IIIB infection in myeloid, monocytic ThP-1 cells.
Compared to mock infected cells, infection with IIIB significantly re-
duced STAT1 and STAT3 protein levels, but IIIBΔVif infection did not
(Fig. 3A & B), further indicating that HIV-Vif plays a significant role in
targeting these STAT proteins. Similarly, infection of ThP-1 cells with an-
other HIV strain (HIV-1 YU-2), also significantly reduced STAT1 and
STAT3 protein expression (Suppl. Fig. 3), revealing these Vif-mediated
effects are not limited to a single HIV strain.
To investigate functional consequences of Vif-mediated STAT reduc-
tion, we next analysed downstream ISG induction. ThP-1 cells were in-
fected with HIV IIIB or IIIBΔVif, before being stimulated with IFN-α for 0
or 2 h. HIV IIIB, but not IIIBΔVif, infection significantly impaired IFN-α-
mediated induction of ISG15 (Fig. 3C). HIV IIIB infection had no effect
on IFN-α-induced MxA expression (Fig. 3D), highlighting that Vif's ef-
fect upon the JAK/STAT pathway has a differential outcome for specific
ISG expression.
3.4. Cellular HIV-p24 Protein Expression is Inhibited by IFN-α Pre-treatment
Only in the Absence of Vif (HIV IIIBΔVif)
Having observed that HIV infection promoted the degradation of es-
sential IFN-α pathway components, we subsequently investigated if
there was a functional consequence of this upon HIV “permissivity” (as
measured by p24 protein levels). CEM T lymphoblastoid cells were pre-
treated for 4 h with IFN-α, before infection with either HIV IIIB or IIIBΔVif
for 24 h. We observed that IFN-α pre-treatment reduced the expression
of p24 protein in the absence of Vif (IIIBΔVif), but was unaffected by
IFN-α in cells infected with the Vif-containing IIIB molecular clone
(Fig. 3E). These findings indicate that Vif may have a role in protecting
HIV from IFN-α's anti-viral activity. Indeed, these results support a hy-
pothesis that the loss of STAT1 and STAT3 in Vif-expressing cells, may re-
duce IFN-α's ability to block HIV infection and/or replication, possibly
revealing a previously unknown HIV immune evasion mechanism.
3.5. Infection of Primary Human PBMCs With HIV IIIB Infectious Clone Re-
duces IFN-α-Induced STAT1 and STAT3 Phosphorylation and ISG Induction
in a “Partially” Vif-dependent Manner
Having observed that infection of myeloid ThP-1 cells with HIV IIIB
significantly reduced STAT1 and STAT3 protein expression and IFN-α-
induced ISG15, we wondered if HIV infection also reduced expression
of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT3 in primary human immune cells.
In order to investigate this, PBMCs were isolated from healthy volun-
teers and infected with either HIV IIIB or the Vif deletion mutant, before
stimulating with IFN-α for 15 min. Even though this in vitro “acute” in-
fection of PBMCs with HIV did not reduce total STAT1 and STAT3 levels,
we found that infection with full length HIV IIIB significantly decreased
both pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 levels (Fig. 4A & B). Interestingly, while
pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 levels in HIV IIIBΔVif infected PBMCs were not sig-
nificantly reduced, there was less phosphorylation compared to mock
Fig. 1. STAT1 and STAT3 protein are specifically reduced upon expression of HIV-Vif. HEK293T cells were transfected with EV or HIV-Vif before cells were lysed and subjected to Western
blotting using (A) STAT1, (B) STAT2, (C) STAT3 and (D) p65 antibodies (kDa ladder weights included on right of blots). All blots were re-probed for HIV-Vif and β-actin. Densitometric
values of STATs and p65 were calculated relative to β-actin and compared to EV, which was normalised to 100%. All results are the average ±SD of (B, C, D) three or (A) four
independent experiments. *P b 0.05; Non-Significant (NS), (Paired t-test).
206

 infected (Fig. 4A & B), indicating that while Vif has a significant impact
upon IFN-α signalling, there may be other viral processes that target
IFN-α signalling. Together these results indicate that Vif significantly
contributes to a decrease in IFN-α signalling. Having observed this re-
duction in active STAT1 and STAT3, we next investigated the effect of
Vif further downstream of STATs. PBMCs from healthy volunteers
were infected with either IIIB or IIIBΔVif, before treating with IFN-α
for 2 h and measuring the induction of ISGs: ISG15, MxA and MxB. Com-
pared to uninfected PBMCs treated with IFN-α, infection with either full
length IIIB or IIIBΔVif, impaired the induction all three ISGs (Fig. 4C–E).
Interestingly, the IFN-α-mediated induction of both ISG15 and MxB was
significantly higher in PBMCs infected with IIIBΔVif, compared with
those infected with the Vif–containing virus, indicating a partial
restoration of these ISGs in the absence of Vif. However, as in ThP-1
cells, the removal of Vif had no significant affect on MxA induction
(Fig. 4E). Together these results support the hypothesis that Vif sup-
presses the JAK/STAT pathway, thus reducing the induction of specific
ISGs, but highlights that other viral immune evasion mechanisms
must also play a role in subverting these essential anti-viral responses.

 responses in ex vivo PBMCs from “chronic” HIV-infected patients. We
isolated PBMCs from HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers and
treated them for 0 and 15 min with IFN-α, before analysing tyrosine
phosphorylation and total protein levels of STAT1 and STAT3. PBMCs
from HIV-infected individuals had significantly decreased levels
of pSTAT1, when compared to PBMCs from healthy controls (HC)
(Fig. 5A and B). Total STAT1 was also significantly reduced in PBMCs
from HIV-infected patients, compared with healthy controls (Fig. 5A
and C). Interestingly, while the mean densitometric value of pSTAT3
and STAT3 protein in PBMCs from HIV+ patients was less than that
of healthy controls, the difference was not statistically significant
(Fig. 5A, D and E). It should be noted that these patients were on anti-
retroviral treatment, therefore it was not surprising that the inhibitory
effects of HIV-1 upon pSTAT3 previously observed in primary PBMCs
was not as “pronounced”. To analyse the IFN-α pathway further
downstream of STATs, PBMCs from HIV-infected patients or healthy
controls were treated with IFN-α for 2 h, before ISG15 mRNA was
measured by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, we observed impaired induction
of ISG15 in HIV patient immune cells, compared to healthy controls,
revealing a functional reduction in this anti-viral ISG's expression
(Fig. 4F).
3.7. HIV-Vif Protein Interacts With Both STAT1 and STAT3
Given that Vif expression reduced STAT1 and STAT3 protein (Fig. 1A
and C), but not their mRNA (Suppl. Fig. 1A), we hypothesised that, as
had previously been observed for APOBEC3G (Sheehy et al., 2003), Vif
might target these proteins for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degra-
dation. To investigate this we first analysed if STAT1, STAT2 or STAT3
interacted with Vif. Lysates from HEK293T cells expressing Vif and

mock infected or infected with IIIB or IIIBΔVif for (A) 2 or (B) 6 days. Thereafter, lysates were generated and subjected to immunoblotting using STAT1, STAT3, β-actin and p24 antibodies
(kDa ladder weights included on right of blots). Densitometric analysis was performed using Image Lab software and values for STATs were calculated relative to β-actin and compared to

gene and IFN-stimulated samples were compared to unstimulated, which were normalised to 1. Graphs are the mean ± SD of four independent experiments *P b 0.05; NS (unpaired t-
test). (E) CEM cells were treated with IFN-α for 4 h before being infected with IIIB and IIIBΔVif for 24 h. Lysates were then generated and subjected to immunoblotting using p24 and β-
actin antibodies (kDa ladder weights included on right of blots). n = 3.

 STAT1-3, revealed that Vif interacts with STAT1 (Fig. 6A) and STAT3
(Fig. 6B). However, STAT2 did not co-immunoprecipitate with Vif
(Fig. 6C). This was not surprising, given that we previously observed
that Vif did not degrade STAT2 protein (Fig. 1B). These findings show
that Vif can interact with STAT1 and STAT3, which may facilitate proxi-
mal ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.

 3.8. HIV-Vif Protein Promotes STAT1 and STAT3 Ubiquitination and
Proteasomal Degradation
To further investigate the mechanism by which Vif may reduce
STAT1 and STAT3 protein, we analysed the role of the proteasome
using a proteosomal inhibitor, MG132. In HEK293T cells expressing
Vif, treatment with MG132 restored STAT1 (Fig. 7A and Suppl Fig. 4A)
and STAT3 (Fig. 7B and Suppl Fig. 4B) protein expression, indicating
that Vif promotes their degradation through the proteasome. In support
of these findings, MG132 treatment also prevented Vif-mediated STAT1
and STAT3 degradation in the human hepatocyte cell line, Huh7, reveal-
ing a HIV-mediated immune evasion mechanism functional in different
cell types (Suppl. Fig. 4C–E). We also found that in HEK293T cells,
transfected with HA-tagged Ubiquitin, STAT1 and STAT3 had enhanced
ubiquitination in the presence of Vif, demonstrating the process of Vif-
mediated STAT1 and STAT3 ubquitination “in action” (Fig. 7C & D). To-
gether these results indicate an immune evasion mechanism by which
Vif promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of STAT1
and STAT3 protein, through the MG132-sensitive 26S proteasome.
3.9. The Vif SOCS-Box Motif (SLQXLA) is Essential for Vif-Induced STAT1 and
STAT3 Degradation
Vif is known to use its SOCS-box motif to hydrophobically bind
ElonginB/C and mutation of its Ser-Leu-Gln residues to Ala-Ala-Ala
(SLQ ➔ AAA) prevents this association (Yu et al., 2004). Having ob-
served that Vif interacted with STAT1 and STAT3 and promoted their
proteasomal degradation, we hypothesised that it mediates this process
via its SOCS-box motif (SLQXLA). To investigate if the Vif-ECS motif was
required for Vif-mediated STAT1 and STAT3 degradation, HEK293T cells
were transiently transfected with CdCl2-inducible Vif, VifΔSLQ or EV.
The expression of Vif significantly reduced STAT1 (Fig. 8A) and STAT3
(Fig. 8B) protein expression, while VifΔSLQ reduced neither STAT1
(Fig. 8A), nor STAT3 (Fig. 8B), indicating that the formation of the func-
tional ECS-type E3 ligase complex, via Vif's SOCS-box, enables STAT1
and STAT3 degradation.
3.10. Vif-Mediated STAT Degradation Requires Cul5 and RBX2 E3 Ligase
Proteins
Having found that the Elongin C binding site within Vif's SOCS-box
was essential for STAT1 and STAT3 degradation, we next analysed,
using shRNA knockdown, if the ECS scaffold proteins, Cul5 and RBX2
were also required for Vif-mediated STAT degradation. Cul5 shRNA suc-
cessfully suppressed Cul5 mRNA expression (Fig. 9A). The expression of
fellow family member, Cul2, was not reduced by Cul5 shRNA, which en-
sured knockdown specificity (Suppl. Fig. 5A). While the expression of
Vif significantly degraded STAT1 and STAT3 in the presence of the con-
trol (CT) shRNA, suppression of Cul5 impaired the ability of Vif to de-
grade STAT1 and STAT3 proteins (Fig. 9C & E), indicating that Cul5 is
required for their degradation. To determine if RBX2 was also required
for Vif-mediated STAT degradation, endogenous RBX2 expression was
suppressed using specific shRNA. RBX2 shRNA successfully suppressed
its mRNA expression (Fig. 9B), while the expression of fellow family
member, RBX1, was unaffected, ensuring knockdown specificity
(Suppl. Fig. 5B). As we observed with Cul5 knockdown (Fig. 9C & E),
suppression of RBX2 expression also impaired Vif-mediated degrada-
tion of STAT1 and STAT3 protein (Fig. 9D & F), indicating that RBX2 is

isolated from 12 HIV infected patients and 5 healthy controls, before treatment for 2 h with IFN-α. Total RNA was extracted and then converted to cDNA, which was used as a
template to measure mRNA levels of ISG15 using qRT-PCR. Gene expression was calculated relative to the housekeeping gene RPS15. IFN-stimulated values were compared to
unstimulated, which were normalised to 1. All graphs are the mean ± SEM. *P b 0.05; **P b 0.01 (Mann-Whitney).

 also required for their degradation. Together these results demonstrate
that Vif uses the “classical” ECS-E3 ligase complex to promote STAT1
and STAT3 degradation.
4. Discussion
The ubiquitin-proteasome system, found in all cells types, is required
for the recycling of damaged, dysfunctional or redundant proteins
(Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998). Several viral species hijack this
basic biological mechanism to promote their own survival. By targeting
cellular proteins required for anti-viral immunity, viruses evade endog-
enous defence mechanisms and increase the amino acid pool for syn-
thesis of their own proteins. This immune evasion process is elegantly
demonstrated through the actions of HCV, RSV and Mumps, which tar-
get the Type I IFN JAK/STAT pathway proteins for degradation (Sheehy
et al., 2003; Stevenson et al., 2013; Elliott et al., 2007; Ulane et al.,
2003). The HIV-protein Vif also uses this ubiquitin-proteasome system
to degrade the cytidine deaminase, APOBEC3G (Sheehy et al., 2003).
Furthermore, Vif and Viral protein r (Vpr), have been shown to target
IRF3 for proteasomal degradation (Okumura et al., 2008). Whereby
the effect of Viral protein u (Vpu), upon IRF-3 is less clear, with one
group reporting its proteolytic degradation (Doehle et al., 2012) and an-
other showing no Vpu-mediated degradation (Hotter et al., 2013). Vpu
has also been shown to promote proteolytic cleavage of IRF3, resulting
in a fragmented IRF3, that no longer contains its essential DNA binding
domain (Park et al., 2014). Interestingly, the HIV-1 Protease is also
thought to inhibit IRF-3 phosphorylation and decrease expression of
both IFN and ISGs, by targeting RIG-I to the lysosomes (Solis et al.,
2011). Collectively, this spectrum of HIV immune evasion mechanisms
that target detection, IFN production and ISG expression, highlight the
importance of the type 1 IFN anti-viral process in clearing HIV infection
(Bourke et al., 2017). This current study indicates that HIV-Vif targets
STAT1 and STAT3 proteins for degradation, indicating an effective im-
mune evasion technique used by HIV-1 to block the anti-viral effects
of Type I IFNs. Type I IFN expression is induced on detection of viral
PAMPs (Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns), by PRRs, which sub-
sequently activates the JAK/STAT pathway (Perry et al., 2005). The
anti-viral activities of the JAK/STAT pathway makes its components ob-
vious targets for viral immune evasion. Since several viruses have al-
ready been shown to promote STAT protein degradation (Banks et al.,
2003), we wondered if HIV-Vif also uses its E3 ligase activity to block
this essential pathway. Indeed, we found that Vif not only catalysed
the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the classical anti-
viral protein, STAT1, but also targeted the multi-functional protein,
STAT3, presenting a mechanism by which HIV subverts immune re-
sponses. The anti-viral role of STAT1 during IFN-α signalling is well
established (Fu et al., 1990), making it a prime target for Vif-mediated
degradation that acts to block downstream ISG induction. In contrast,
while STAT3 is phosphorylated by IFN-α (Yang et al., 1998; Stevenson
et al., 2013), its anti-viral role remains less clear. However, several

 viruses, including Measles, Mumps and HCV, target STAT3's signal trans-
duction (Stevenson et al., 2013; Ulane et al., 2003; Palosaari et al., 2003)
and we have shown STAT3 to be essential for anti-viral activity against
Vaccinia and Influenza (Mahony et al., 2017), pointing towards a signif-
icant role for STAT3 in anti-viral immunity. Indeed, HIV-Vif-mediated
STAT3 degradation further emphasises its anti-viral potential.
Type 1 IFNs are highly pleiotropic innate cytokines, contributing di-
rectly to HIV-1 control via upregulation of ISGs, and indirectly via the ac-
tivation of other innate and adaptive anti-viral responses. IFN-α JAK/
STAT signalling mediates induction of ISGs and can regulate cell activa-
tion, function, proliferation or survival (Der et al., 1998b). In ThP-1 cells
we studied the effects of Vif-mediated STAT degradation upon IFN-α in-
duction of two ISGs, with diverse anti-viral effects. We found that the in-
duction of ISG15, but not MxA, was significantly suppressed, revealing a
differential, but specific immune evasion mechanism for Vif. Since we
observed a Vif-mediated reduction in STAT1 and STAT3 expression, it
was no surprise to observe that IFN-α induction of ISG15 was signifi-
cantly reduced. Indeed, ISG15 has an essential role inhibiting HIV-1 vi-
rion release (Okumura et al., 2006; Pincetic et al., 2010; Woods et al.,
2011), which makes it a likely immune evasion target for HIV. Interest-
ingly, STAT3 has been shown to have a role in the upregulation of ISG15
in response to IFN-α which may explain why Vif has evolved to target it
for proteasomal degradation (Mahony et al., 2017). In contrast to ISG15,
MxA has no currently known role in the control of HIV-1 replication. In-
terestingly, Ribavirin, which was until recently, used in combination
with IFN-α for the treatment of HCV, enhances IFN-α-mediated MxA in-
duction in Huh7 cells, but fails to enhance IFN-α induced PKR, OAS or
CXCL10 (Stevenson et al., 2011), highlighting the complexity of signal
transduction involved in specific ISG expression. Indeed, HIV can upreg-
ulate MxA independently of IFN-α in monocytes, further revealing the
unique nature of MxA expression and an area of research that warrants
further exploration (Baca et al., 1994). We found that IFN-α induced sig-
nificantly higher levels of ISG15 in primary human PBMCs infected with
a IIIB Vif deletion mutant (IIIBΔVif), compared to cells infected with the
full length virus; and similar to our findings in ThP-1 cells, the presence
of Vif had no significant effect on MxA induction. MxB, unlike MxA, has
been shown to have an inhibitory effect upon HIV-1 (Goujon et al.,
2013; Haller and Kochs, 2011; Kane et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013). In
line with MxB's important role against HIV, we found that compared
to PBMCs infected with full length HIV-1 IIIB, IIIBΔVif-infected cells
treated with IFN-α also produced significantly higher levels of MxB in
response to IFN-α. Indeed these results highlight that, unlike MxA,
MxB induction is stunted in the presence of Vif. Together these findings
provide an insight into how Vif protein creates a favourable environ-
ment for HIV-1 replication.
In agreement with our findings in primary PBMCs from HIV-infected
patients, Hardy et al., reported that monocytes from HIV-infected pa-
tients had reduced levels of pSTAT1 and anti-viral gene induction
(Hardy et al., 2009). It is worth noting that they also discovered that
the effect of HIV infection upon IFN-α signalling was independent of
IFNα/β levels (Hardy et al., 2009), indicating that, as we have now dis-
covered, HIV infection attenuated the IFN-α signalling pathway. While
our studies showed that “acute” infection of primary human PBMCs
with HIV-1 stunted pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 expression, we did not observe
a reduction of total STAT1 and STAT3 protein. However, compared to
healthy controls, both phosphorylation and total STAT protein levels
were reduced in PBMCs from “chronically” infected patients. Indeed, it
is well known that “acute” infection of HIV leads to a cytokine “storm”
(Stacey et al., 2009), and since cytokines induce the expression of
STATs (Lehtonen et al., 1997; Narimatsu et al., 2001), we hypothesise
that cytokine induction of STAT proteins during “acute” infection of
PBMCs may indeed “mask” the Vif-mediated reduction of STAT proteins.
Of course, while HIV-Vif may have a significant role in regulating IFN-α
responses via STAT degradation, we should note that other HIV immune
evasion strategies are also “at play” in vivo. Indeed, compared to con-
trols, infection of PBMCs with both HIV-1 IIIB and IIIBΔVif decreased
IFN-α-mediated ISG15, MxA and MxB induction, highlighting the pres-
ence of additional HIV immune-suppressive activity.
Importantly, our studies also indicate that Vif's attenuation of the
IFN-α signalling pathway affects HIV infectivity. In fact, upon pre-treat-
ment of CEM cells with IFN-α, there was reduction in p24 protein levels
in IIIBΔVif infected cells, but not in IIIB infected cells, indicating that Vif
protects HIV from innate anti-viral IFN-α responses. Similarly to Vif, the
V proteins of simian virus 5 and human parainfluenza virus type 2 target

 STAT proteins for degradation, which also prevents the induction of an
anti-viral state in V protein expressing cell lines (Andrejeva et al.,
2002). Together these findings highlight the crucial antiviral activity of
STAT proteins.
IFN-α's broad anti-viral effects made it an obvious choice for treat-
ment for HIV infection in the early 1980s. However, responses to treat-
ment were variable, with higher baseline CD4 T cell counts being
associated with better clinical response and greater decline in viral load.
While these clinical benefits were modest and some decline in viral load
was observed in several studies, the decrease was limited in magnitude
(typically 0.5 to 1 log), and was not sustained (Katabira et al., 1998;
Vento et al., 1993; Soriano et al., 1994; Sperber et al., 1993; Fischl, 1991;
Skillman et al., 1996; Hatzakis et al., 2001; Asmuth et al., 2010; Manion
et al., 2012). More recent studies have tested the effects of pegylated-
IFN-α upon HIV control during structured ART interruptions. While en-
hanced HIV control was observed in some studies, viremia eventually
rebounded in patients who remained off ART (Dianzani et al., 2008;
Azzoni et al., 2013; Lane et al., 1988; Goujard et al., 2012). Together,
these findings suggest that IFN-α treatment can improve the control of
HIV (particularly when administered in early infection, or to patients
treated with ART), but unknown viral immune evasion mechanisms
have limited its efficacy. The results of our study reveal a mechanism
that may help explain this therapeutic failure. We have found that HIV-
Vif has a functional role in degrading STAT1 and STAT3, demonstrating
a mechanism by which HIV blocks specific anti-viral gene induction. Res-
toration of anti-viral responsiveness to IFN-α may enhance HIV clearance
and pave the way towards a new therapeutic approach for HIV, that could
be used alongside ART and/or employed together with latency-reversing
agents, as part of a much needed HIV cure strategy.
