IMPORTANCE Statins remain a mainstay in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
OBJECTIVE To detail the trends in use and total and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures
associated with statins in a representative US adult population from 2002 to 2013.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective longitudinal cohort study was
conducted from January 2002 to December 2013. Demographic, medical condition, and
prescribed medicine information of adults 40 years and older between 2002 and 2013 were
obtained from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey database.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimated trends in statin use, total expenditure, and OOP
share among the general adult population, those with established ASCVD, and those at risk
for ASCVD. Costs were adjusted to 2013 US dollars using the Gross Domestic Product Index.
RESULTS From 2002 to 2013, more than 157 000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
participants were eligible for the study (mean [SD] age, 57.7 [39.9] years; 52.1% female).
Overall, statin use among US adults 40 years of age and older in the general population
increased 79.8% from 21.8 million individuals (17.9%) in 2002-2003 (134 million
prescriptions) to 39.2 million individuals (27.8%) in 2012-2013 (221 million prescriptions).
Among those with established ASCVD, statin use was 49.8% and 58.1% in 2002-2003 and
2012-2013, respectively, and less than one-third were prescribed as a high-intensity dose.
Across all subgroups, statin use was significantly lower in women (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% CI,
0.79-0.85), racial/ethnic minorities (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.61-0.70), and the uninsured
(odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.30-0.37). The proportion of generic statin use increased
substantially, from 8.4% in 2002-2003 to 81.8% in 2012-2013. Gross domestic
product–adjusted total cost for statins decreased from $17.2 billion (OOP cost, $7.6 billion) in
2002-2003 to $16.9 billion (OOP cost, $3.9 billion) in 2012-2013, and the mean annual OOP
costs for patients decreased from $348 to $94. Brand-name statins were used by 18.2% of
statin users, accounting for 55% of total costs in 2012-2013.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Statin use increased substantially in the last decade among US
adults, although the uptake was suboptimal in high-risk groups. While total and OOP
expenditures associated with statins decreased, further substitution of brand-name to
generic statins may yield more savings.

S
tatins are one of the most well-established measures for
the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular disease (ASCVD). Guidelines released by the
American Heart Association and the American College of
Cardiology broadened the proportion of US adults in whom
statins are indicated from 37.5% (43.2 million) to 48.6% (56
million).1,2 These guidelines also included specific recommen-
dations about using high-intensity statins among select high-
risk individuals. However, contemporary data on national pat-
terns for statin use are limited.
Previous analyses have shown that pharmaceutical
products are a significant driver of health care costs.3 As the
health care system evolves, patients face higher out-of-
pocket (OOP) expenditures,4 contributing to increased finan-
cial burden.5 Statins are the most commonly prescribed
medications in the United States,6 and while their cost-
effectiveness has been established in several subgroups,7,8
these results are as sensitive to the cost of statins as they are
to users’risk level. While the recent introduction of generic
statins has led to a decrease in the cost of statins, to our
knowledge, trends of the intensity or expenditures on stat-
ins have not been robustly examined.
In this study, we analyzed the nationally representative
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data from 2002 to
2013 to delineate trends in statin use and costs. These results
could have important insights for guidelines and public health
discussions aimed at improving the efficiency and cost-
effectiveness of statin use in appropriate primary and second-
ary prevention populations.
Methods
Study Design and Population
Weperformeda12-yearretrospective,longitudinalcohortstudy
of US adults 40 years and older using the 2002-2013 MEPS da-
tabase. The database is sponsored by the Agency for Health-
care Research and Quality and is a national survey of individu-
als and families, clinicians, and employers for medical
conditions and health care resource use and costs. Each year,
the MEPS Household Components’sample is drawn from re-
spondentsofthepreviousyear’
sNationalHealthInterviewSur-
vey. It has an overlapping panel design, with each panel com-
posed of randomly sampled, noninstitutionalized US civilians.
Participants are interviewed every 6 months over 30 months
and their responses are reported annually to provide nation-
ally representative estimates of sociodemographic character-
istics, medical conditions, and health care use and costs.9 In-
terviews are conducted over the telephone, and further
information is obtained from physicians, hospitals, and phar-
maciestosupplyadditionalinformationonhealthcareuseand
cost data. After data collection, Agency for Healthcare Re-
searchandQualityresearchersassignperson-weightsandvari-
ance estimation stratum to reflect survey nonresponse and
population totals from the participants surveyed.10 Because
the MEPS consists of publicly available, deidentified data files,
this current study was exempted from institutional review
board approval, per the US Department of Health and Human
Services guidelines. Written consent was obtained from par-
ticipants to be contacted for interviews and to contact their cli-
nicians and pharmacies.
We merged the MEPS Household Components’full-year
consolidated, medical conditions, and prescribed medicines
files for each year from 2002 to 2013 to create annual files with
sociodemographic characteristics, medical conditions, and
medication use and expenditures. For ease of analysis and re-
porting,wepooleddatainto2-yearcyclesandadjustedtheper-
son-level weight accordingly to reflect the mean annual popu-
lation size and medication use and expenditures of the 2 years
ineachcycle.Individualsincludedinouranalysiswere40years
of age and older at the time of the survey, had a body mass in-
dex (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared) of 18.5 or more (underweight individuals gen-
erally represent a sicker population),11 and with a final survey
person-weight greater than 0 to be representative of the na-
tional population at the time of the survey (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement).
Our study population was stratified into 2 ASCVD risk
groups1,2: participants with known ASCVD included (1) those
with coronary heart disease (CHD) and (2) those with stroke
and/or peripheral arterial disease and participants without
known ASCVD substratified into (1) those with diabetes and
(2) those with dyslipidemia and without diabetes. Partici-
pants were classified into these groups if they had an Interna-
tionalStatisticalClassificationofDiseases,NinthRevision,Clini-
cal Modification diagnosis of the condition (eTable 1 in the
Supplement) and/or self-reported history of the diagnosis.
Statin Use and Expenditures
Duringthehouseholdinterview,MEPSrespondentswereasked
to supply the name of any prescribed medicine they or their
family members purchased or otherwise obtained in the ref-
erence period. The interviewers entered verbatim the names
of the prescription and other information as reported by the
respondents,12 who were also asked for permission to obtain
payment data from pharmacies. With written permission from
participants, pharmacies were contacted to obtain informa-
tion on the date filled, national drug code, and medication
Key Points
Question What are the trends in statin use and expenditure in the
US adult population?
Findings This cohort study found that statin use among adults 40
years and older increased from 17.9% in 2002-2003 to 27.8% in
2012-2013, with significantly lower use among women,
racial/ethnic minorities, and the uninsured. The gross domestic
product–adjusted total cost for statins decreased from $17.2 billion
(out-of-pocket cost, $7.6 billion) to $16.9 billion (out-of-pocket
cost, $3.9 billion), with brand-name statins accounting for 55% of
total costs in 2012-2013.
Meaning In the US adult population, while statin use increased
substantially over the last decade, disparities and suboptimal
uptake in higher-risk groups, along with significant costs, persisted
in this time frame.

name, strength of medicine, quantity, amount payed, and
source of payments. In 2011, 69.7% of Household Compo-
nents respondents granted permission to contact pharma-
cies, and 73.3% of pharmacies responded. For those with miss-
ing data, the payment information was imputed from the
pharmacy data for another person’
s purchase of the same drug
(see eAppendix in the Supplement for more details). When
compared with the Medicare Part D claims record, MEPS was
not different in the proportion of beneficiaries reporting any
prescription drug use, with an agreement rate of 0.97 (95% CI,
0.96-0.98), and a κ of 0.66.12 The multisourced, person-level
medication information was then included in the MEPS Pre-
scribed Medicine Files and linked to the Multum Lexicon da-
tabase by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
researchers,13 which gives the class of drug. In this study, the
Multum code 173 for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
reductase inhibitors was classified as statins. Because all lipid-
lowering combinations (Multum drug code 317) surveyed in
MEPS contained an 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
agent, we included them in the medications we identified as
statins. For each year, we used the variable specifying the drug
names to identify the major types of statins. We also used drug
namestoclassifystatinsasbrandnameorgeneric.Thestrength
of each prescribed medicine was used to generate the dose in-
tensity of statin used; atorvastatin, 40 to 80 mg, and rosuvas-
tatin, 20 to 40 mg, daily were classified as high-intensity stat-
ins, while all others were classified as moderate-to-low
intensity.1

ditures from 2002 to 2013 to constant 2013 US dollars.
Covariates
We considered age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, cardio-
vascular disease modifiable risk factors, and Charlson Comor-
bidity Index (CCI) score as factors that affect the time trends
in statin use and expenditure and therefore were treated as co-
variates in our analyses. Participants’age as of the last day of
the survey year were grouped into 3 categories: 40 to 64, 65
to 74, and 75 years and older. We had 5 categories of race and
ethnicity: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, His-
panic, Asian, and other (American Indian, Alaska Native, and
those who reported multiple races/ethnicities) categories.
There were 5 categories of family income level as a propor-
tion of the federal poverty level (FPL): poor (<100% of FPL),
near poor (100%-<125% of FPL), low income (125%-<200% of
FPL), middle income (200%-<400% of FPL), and high in-
come (≥400% of FPL). We estimated participants’comorbid-
ity burden using the Grouped CCI (GCCI), which has been de-
scribed extensively elsewhere.14,15 For our analysis, however,
we modified the GCCI by excluding acute myocardial infarc-
tion,congestiveheartfailure,peripheralvasculardisease,cere-
brovascular disease, and diabetes from our estimating GCCI
score to avoid collinearity in our regression analyses. There
were 3 categories for GCCI: 0, no comorbidity; 1, 1 long-term
condition; and 2, 2 or more long-term conditions present other
than CVD and/or diabetes. Hypertension, diabetes, and hy-
perlipidemia were determined using International Statistical
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modifica-
tion diagnosis or self-report (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using Stata version 14 (Stata-
Corp). Using the final person-weight and variance estima-
tions (person sampling units and stratum), we accounted for
the complex sampling design of the MEPS in all analyses to es-
timate nationally representative totals, means, and rates for
persons in the civilian noninstitutionalized population. We ap-
plied the final person-weight adjusted for the 2-year cycles to
the data and we used the svy: proportion command in Stata to
estimate the proportion of the population using any, high-
intensity, generic, and brand-name statin per cycle; the svy:
total command to estimate the total number of persons re-
porting statin use, the total number of prescriptions, and the
total expenditures; and the svy: mean command to estimate
theaverageexpendituresonanystatin.Ourtrendanalysisover
the 12-year period was done using weighted linear regression
models with estimated means or proportions as outcome vari-
ables and survey cycle as predictor. We determined the pre-
dictors of statin use using 3 different logistic regression
models of statin use (yes vs no) on possible predictors. We per-
formed a univariate logistic regression first, followed by model
1, which included the univariate predictors, and adjusted for
age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Model 2 was a multivariate logis-
tic regression consisting of all the predictor variables. We re-
ported odd ratios (ORs) of statin use comparing other cycles
with 2002-2003, the referent cycle. In all analyses, 95% CIs
were reported, and 2-sided P < .05 was considered statisti-
cally significant.
Results
Overall, from 2002 to 2013, 157 719 MEPS participants were eli-
gible for the study (mean age [SD], 57.7 [39.9] years; 52.1% fe-
male) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Table 1 describes char-
acteristicsoftheentirestudypopulation.Ofthese,24.6%(95%
CI, 24.2%-25.0%) reported any statin use, with 9% of all statin
users reporting only 1 prescription. The characteristics of those
taking vs not taking statins over the 12-year period are de-
tailed in eTable 2 and eTable 3 in the Supplement, respec-
tively. Most statin users were non-Hispanic white males with
health insurance. During this period, statins users were pri-
marily patients diagnosed as having hyperlipidemia, repre-
senting 93% in 2002-2003 and 96% in 2012-2013.
Trends in Statin Use
The estimates of statin use (%) in the general adult popula-
tion and in different risk groups are shown in Figure 1. The
number of adults in the general population who reported using
any statin increased from 21.8 million (17.9%) in 2002-2003
to 39.2 million (27.8%) in 2012-2013, representing a 79.8%

increase, with the largest increase seen between 2002-2003
and 2004-2005. Annual statin prescriptions increased from
134 million to 221 million (64.9% increase) over this period.
A similar increase in statin use was also observed among pa-
tients with ASCVD, although statin use appeared to plateau be-
tween 2004-2005 and 2008-2009 before slightly increasing
again in 2010-2011. Statin use steadily increased from 13.4%
to 22.2% among those without ASCVD, 33.4% to 52.7% among
those with diabetes, and 28.1% to 47.0% among those with hy-
perlipidemia and not diabetes over the 12-year period.
Overall, the proportion of statin as high intensity
increased from 16.5% in 2002-2003 to 20.4% in 2012-2013 in

the general adult population, peaking at 21.9% in 2008-
2009 (Figure 1). Among participants with ASCVD, statin use
was most prevalent among patients with CHD, 31% of whom
reported using high-intensity dose statins in 2012-2013. Of
those without established ASCVD, 18.4% of participants with
diabetes reported high-intensity statin use in 2012-2013.
Table 2 details 12-year statin use patterns across partici-
pants’characteristics. Statin use was least among adults aged
40 to 64 years, consistently higher among males and non-
Hispanic white patients. Similar patterns of statin use were
noted in the different subgroups over the years (eTable 4 in the
Supplement).
Distribution of Branded and Generic Statins
In 2002-2003, 19.9 million adults used brand-name statins,
accounting for 91.6% of all statin prescriptions (n = 126 mil-
lion). By 2012-2013, brand-name statins were only used by
18.2% of users (7.8 million adults; 44.4 million prescrip-
tions), while 31.4 million adults were using generic statins
(177 million prescriptions). A similar pattern was observed
across all subgroups (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Among
available statins, atorvastatin remained the most commonly
prescribed through 2006-2007, after which it was surpassed
by simvastatin. In 2012-2013, simvastatin (41.4%) and ator-
vastatin (28.3%) were the most commonly used statins, fol-
lowed by pravastatin (16.2%), rosuvastatin (11.2%), and
lovastatin (7.0%) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Predictors of Statin Use
The likelihood of any statin use in the general US population
increased with calendar year (expressed as 2-year cycles)
(Table 3). In a multivariable-adjusted analysis, compared
with those aged 40 to 64 years, adults aged 65 to 74 years
and adults aged 74 years or older were more likely to report

statin use, with ORs of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.81-2.11) and 1.80 (95%
CI, 1.66-1.96), respectively. Females vs males (OR, 0.81; 95%
CI, 0.79-0.85); racial/ethnic minorities (vs non-Hispanic
white individuals), including non-Hispanic black (OR, 0.65;
95% CI, 0.61-0.70) and Hispanic (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.64-
0.73) individuals; and the uninsured vs those with public
insurance (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.30-0.37) were significantly
less likely to report statin use in the 12-year period. Similar
differences were noted among those with ASCVD as well
as high-risk populations without ASCVD (eg, those with
diabetes) (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Trends in Statin Expenditure
In 2002-2003, annual total expenditures for statins were
$17.2 billion, peaking at $22 billion in 2008-2009 and trend-
ing down to $16.9 billion in 2012-2013 (Figure 2). A similar
trend was noted for OOP expenditures, which increased
from $7.6 billion to $8.8 billion from 2002-2003 to 2004-
2005 (Figure 2), before decreasing to $3.9 billion in 2012-
2013. Brand-name statins accounted for 94% of statin-
related expenditures in 2002-2003, significantly declining
to 55% in 2012-2013. The trends of total and OOP statin
expenditures in the different subgroups are shown in

eFigure 4 and eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Among US
adults, mean per-user annual expenditures (in constant 2013
dollars) for all statins fell from $791 in 2002-2003 to $409 in
2012-2013. However, over the same time frame, mean per-
user annual expenditures for branded statins rose from $808
to $1188, whereas the respective costs for generic statins fell
from $498 to $227 (eFigure 6 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Our study provides detailed insights into trends in use, dis-
parities in uptake, and costs associated with statin use be-
tween 2002 and 2013. We observed a significant increase in
statin use among the US general population; however, the ob-
served uptake among individuals with established ASCVD—a
group that derives the greatest benefit from statins—was sub-
optimal. Furthermore, the use of high-intensity statins among
patients with established ASCVD was particularly low. Our
study also found that despite improvement in statin use, sig-
nificantinequitiespersistinvarioussubgroupssuchaswomen,
racial/ethnic minorities, and the uninsured. Last, while sig-
nificant reductions in costs were associated with increased use
of generic statins, branded statins continued to account for a
larger portion of overall and OOP costs.
Overall, statin use increased by 79% among the US adult
population, rising from 17.9% to 27.8% from 2002-2003 to
2012-2013. A similar increase in statin use has been noted in
other nationally representative studies from both developed
and developing countries.16-18 While these figures represent
modestsuccessinimprovingstatinuptakeinthegeneralpopu-
lation,thetrendsinhigh-riskgroups,suchasthosewithASCVD
and diabetes, remain suboptimal. Since 2004-2005, statin use
in those with CHD essentially remained unchanged, increas-
ing slightly from 60% to 63%. This finding is consistent with
insights from National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey data showing that only 60% of US adults with CHD were
taking lipid-lowering medications in 2005-200619 compared
with 70.8% in 2012.20 Similar trends were noted in Medicare
patients with CHD, who also showed a modest rise in statin use
from 61% in 200421 to 66% in 2007-2008.22
While high-intensity statins improve outcomes in high-
risk populations and their use is a class 1A recommendation,
we noted significant underuse of high-intensity statins among
selected population groups. In those with established ASCVD,
high-intensitystatinswereusedbyonly21.5%patientsin2002-
2003, rising to 28.9% in 2012-2013. These findings are consis-
tentwithrecentfindingsfromanationalregistryreportingthat
only 1 in 5 patients with myocardial infarction were dis-
charged with high-intensity statins.23,24 Of Medicare benefi-
ciarieswhoweredischargedfromahospitalafteranacutemyo-
cardial infarction, only 27% of patients’first prescription after
discharge was for a high-intensity statin.25 Factors noted to
be associated with reduced uptake of appropriate high-
intensity statin use include a focus on low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol goals and patient concerns regarding adverse
effects.25Thesuboptimaluseofintensivestatintherapyamong
21.9 million US adults in 2012-2013 with established ASCVD
raises concerns about missed opportunities for intensive sec-
ondary prevention in high-risk patients and highlights an im-
portant opportunity to improve care and reduce recom-
mended treatment gaps. While statin use is a commonly used
quality metric to assess optimal care of patients with ASCVD,26
it is necessary to also include dose intensity as a quality met-
ric to maximize the myriad benefits of statin therapy in high-
risk patients. Increased education is needed to have physi-
ciansprescriberecommendedstatindosestohigh-riskpatients
independent of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
Inequalities in high-value treatment gaps have generated
significantinterestinrecentyearsfrominvestigatorsandpolicy
makers. Previous cross-sectional studies have suggested wide-
spread inequities in statin use among select demographic
groups.20,27,28 We expand on this work, showing that while
statin use among younger patients; women; racial/ethnic mi-
norities, especially black and Hispanic individuals; and the un-
insured have improved over time, practice gaps persisted over
the12-yearstudyperiod.Althoughdisparitiesininsurancecov-
erage have been identified by the Institute of Medicine as a key
driver of persistent health care discrepancies among these vul-
nerable groups, our findings demonstrate differential uptake
of statins among different demographics groups not fully
explained by insurance characteristics. This suggests that

equitable access to health care might not equate to uniform
quality of care.29 These findings should stimulate policymak-
ers and clinicians to enact resolute efforts allowing consis-
tent adoption of guidelines in these vulnerable populations to
eliminate this variance.29 Detailed future insights into fac-
tors contributing to existing gaps in well-established care path-
ways, such as statin use in high-risk groups, are critical to as-
sembling pragmatic actions to address these persistent health
disparities.
Our comprehensive analysis of trends in total statin drug
costs for the US adult population provides valuable insights for
policy makers with regard to projecting the cost of cardiovas-
cular care. Our data show that the introduction of generic stat-
ins had a pronounced effect on the cost associated with statin
use in the last 12 years. Over the study period, the gross domes-
tic product–adjusted cost for statins went from $17.2 billion in
2002-2003, peaking at $22 billion in 2008-2009, followed by
a downward trend to $16.9 billion in 2012-2013. Over the same
period,patientcost-shareforstatinsdecreasedfrom44.2%($7.6
billion) to 23.1% ($3.9 billion), with the mean annual OOP cost
per user reduced by 75% from $348 to $94. While the reduc-
tion in costs since 2008-2009 is encouraging, further gains can
be achieved by expanding the use of generic statins. With most
major statins coming off patent during the study period, an in-
crease in generic statin use was noted. In the general popula-
tion,brand-namestatinusedecreasedfrom91.6%to18.2%over
thestudyperiod.Similarreductionswerenotedamongallstudy
subgroups (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). All statins that be-
came generic saw increases in their prescription, reflecting ap-
propriate clinician market response (eFigure 3 in the Supple-
ment). However, despite these impressive reductions, 1 in 5
patients in 2013 continued to take brand-name statins despite
equivalent generic alternatives, blunting additional potential
cost reductions. Therapeutic substitution from brand-name to
generic statins, which is influenced by the preferences of phy-
sicians and/or patients, is of paramount importance in the cur-
rent climate of cost-containment.
Limitations
The present findings should be interpreted in the context of
the following limitations. First, because the MEPS was car-
ried out in a noninstitutionalized adult population, our
results are only generalizable to adults dwelling in commu-
nities and not those living in nursing homes. Second, our
classification of adults into ASCVD risk groups was partly
based on self-report, which could result in possible underes-
timation of risk groups’sizes. Third, any statin use was con-
sidered regardless of the number of prescriptions to ensure
accurate estimation of expenditures and this could poten-
tially overestimate statin use. However, when statin use was
considered to be restricted to individuals with at least 2 pre-
scriptions, it did not affect the results, but we observed
lesser statin use as we increased the threshold for the num-
ber of prescriptions in our description of statin use. Of note,
when limited to 2 or more prescriptions, the proportion of
the population using statins was 22.4%, and it was 20.0%
when limited to 3 or more prescriptions. It is important to
note that our results do not reflect patterns of adherence and
long-term use. Finally, our study lacked insight into the sta-
tus of statin use following the adoption of the American Col-
lege of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines in
2013 as the MEPS Prescribed Medicine File was not released
at the time of the current study. However, previous goal-
directed guidelines would necessitate high-intensity statin
use in most high-risk patients regardless.
Conclusions
In conclusion, while use of statins has increased substan-
tially in the general population from 2002 to 2013, appropri-
ate uptake in high-risk groups remains suboptimal, with per-
sistent disparities noted among women, racial/ethnic
minorities, and the uninsured. We noted that high-intensity
statin use remains an important gap that needs to be more
aggressively targeted by policy makers. Although significant
temporal reduction in drug costs continues to be realized
with broader generic substitution, in 2013, almost 1 in 5 pre-
scriptions were branded and accounted for 55% of total
statin-related expenditures. These findings have important
public health implications and should stimulate further dis-
cussions among stakeholders for pragmatic patient-centered
interventions to improve appropriate statin use and manage
associated costs.
