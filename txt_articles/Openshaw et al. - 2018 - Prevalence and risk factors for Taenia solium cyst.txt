Abstract
Background
Taenia solium cysticercosis affects millions of impoverished people worldwide and can
cause neurocysticercosis, an infection of the central nervous system which is potentially
fatal. Children may represent an especially vulnerable population to neurocysticercosis, due
to the risk of cognitive impairment during formative school years. While previous epidemio-
logic studies have suggested high prevalence in rural China, the prevalence in children as
well as risk factors and impact of disease in low-resource areas remain poorly characterized.
Methodology/Principal findings
Utilizing school based sampling, we conducted a cross-sectional study, administering a
questionnaire and collecting blood for T. solium cysticercosis antibodies in 2867 fifth and
sixth grade students across 27 schools in west Sichuan. We used mixed-effects logistic
regression models controlling for school-level clustering to study associations between risk
factors and to characterize factors influencing the administration of deworming medication.
Overall prevalence of cysticercosis antibodies was 6%, but prevalence was significantly
higher in three schools which all had prevalences of 15% or higher. Students from house-
holds owning pigs (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.81, 95% CI 1.08–3.03), from households
reporting feeding their pigs human feces (adjusted OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.03–2.16), and self-
reporting worms in their feces (adjusted OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.18–2.91) were more likely to
have cysticercosis IgG antibodies. Students attending high prevalence schools were more
likely to come from households allowing pigs to freely forage for food (OR 2.26, 95% CI
1.72–2.98) and lacking a toilet (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.38–2.46). Children who were boarding at

Conclusions/Significance
Our study indicates high prevalences of cysticercosis antibodies in young school aged chil-
dren in rural China. While further studies to assess potential for school-based transmission
are needed, school-based disease control may be an important intervention to ensure the
health of vulnerable pediatric populations in T. solium endemic areas.
Author summary
The zoonotic tapeworm, Taenia solium, affects millions of impoverished people world-
wide and can cause neurocysticercosis (NCC), an infection of the central nervous system
which is potentially fatal. Hypothetically, children may be a vulnerable population to
infection as neurological problems and cognitive impairment caused by NCC during for-
mative school years may lead to poor academic performance, contributing to drop-out
rates and, eventually, propagating cycles of poverty. We carried out a school-based study
of T. solium cysticerosis in primary school-aged children in rural western Sichuan. Our
results indicate high levels of T. solium exposure in young school-aged children in rural
China. While further studies to assess disease transmission within schools are needed,
school-based disease control may be an important intervention to ensure the health of
pediatric populations at risk for infection.
Introduction
Infection with the zoonotic tapeworm Taenia solium affects millions of people living in poverty
throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America [1]. Considered a neglected tropical disease, infec-
tion is linked to inadequate sanitation and hygiene, presence of free roaming pigs, and poverty
[2]. Infection in humans has two manifestations: intestinal taeniasis where humans serve as
the definitive hosts for the adult tapeworm which inhabits the gastrointestinal tract, and cysti-
cercosis, a tissue infection where humans are the accidental dead-end host for the cystic larvae
(cysticercus).
Intestinal infestation with the adult tapeworm develops when humans consume improperly
cooked pork containing cysticerci. The consumed cyst is released in the small intestines where
the adult worm develops, attaches to the intestinal wall, and liberates thousands of eggs, which
are shed, along with gravid proglottids, in human feces. T. solium eggs contaminate the envi-
ronment and are consumed by pigs that ingest human feces directly or indirectly through con-
taminated agricultural products. Once consumed, the larval forms encyst in porcine muscle
completing the cycle [3]. Human cysticercosis develops when T. solium eggs are consumed by
humans through auto-infection, consumption of contaminated food or water, or close contact
with a tapeworm carrier [4]. Upon ingestion of mature eggs, the hatched parasite migrates to
tissues throughout the body including muscle, sub-cutaneous tissues, orbits, and the central
nervous system (CNS) [5–7].
Neurocysticercosis (NCC) develops when T. solium larva establishes itself in the CNS and
may lead to morbidity which can be fatal [5,8,9]. NCC causes a range of symptoms depending
on number, stage of involution, volume, and location of the lesions [10], including seizures,

 chronic headaches, focal neurological deficits, psychiatric disturbances, and cognitive
impairment [3,11–15].
The full prevalence of NCC is difficult to establish, it is estimated to be responsible for 29%
of acquired epilepsy in endemic areas [16], and has been identified as a leading cause of death
from foodborne disease resulting in 2.8 million disability-adjusted life years lost in 2010 [2]. T.
solium has been reported throughout China, with hyperendemic foci mainly in southwest
regions [17]. Overall, NCC may affect up to an estimated 7 million people in China [1]. How-
ever, the risk factors for infection and impact of disease in rural areas remain poorly character-
ized [17,18].
Children may represent an especially vulnerable population to NCC, with resulting neuro-
logical problems and cognitive impairment during formative school years possibly leading to
poor academic performance, contributing to high drop-out rates and, eventually, propagating
cycles of poverty. Schools may represent centers of transmission combining poor hygienic
standards and close contact in a large and vulnerable population. Despite this hypothetical
risk, the prevalence of cysticercosis within schools has not been well evaluated.
Here we report the prevalence of cysticercosis antibodies and associated risk factors in
school-aged children using school-based sampling in western Sichuan, People’s Republic of
China.
Methods
Ethics statement
The school principals, who are the children’s legal guardians while they are boarding at school,
provided initial written consent for student participation, and each student provided verbal
assent prior to participating. Consent and assent status were documented by field staff, and
students who did not assent did not participate in the questionnaire or blood collection. Field
staff and school staff described the purpose of the study using pre-written scripts and were
available on hand to answer questions that students might have either about the study or ques-
tionnaires. Information on the study and a consent form were part of the take-home question-
naire, requesting written consent from adult caretakers in regard to their and their family
member’s involvement. All participants were allowed to keep a copy of the consent/assent doc-
ument. The study and all methodology were approved by the institutional review board of
Stanford University (study ID 35415) and the ethical review board of West China School of
Public Health, Sichuan University (K2015031).
Sampling
The data used in this analysis were collected as part of an epidemiological field study con-
ducted in November 2015 investigating T. solium cysticercosis and NCC prevalence, associa-
tions between NCC infection and academic performance, and risk factors for infection in
school-aged children. Results of the cognitive and academic assessments, prevalences of NCC
cases, and frequency of neurologic problems will be presented in another manuscript and are
not further discussed here.
The study was carried out in rural mountainous areas of western Sichuan. Located at the
eastern extremity of the Tibetan Plateau and with an average altitude of 2700 meters, these areas
are largely characterized by smallholder farmers who raise pigs and partake in small-scale agri-
culture. These areas were selected as they had been identified as having high endemicity of Tae-
nia species based on smaller scale studies [18]. In these remote areas, there is no routine mass
antihelminthic drug administration for pediatric or adult populations.

 To collect data which could be generalizable to school-aged children living in farming and
pig raising communities in western Sichuan with known T. solium risk factors we used a
school-based sampling technique. The study was conducted in three counties, each from one
of three prefectures in western Sichuan. In selecting the three study counties (S1 Fig), we con-
sidered all counties within Aba (13 counties total), Ganzi (18 counties total), and Liangshan
(16 counties and 1 autonomous county total) prefectures for the study. All counties in these
prefectures are known to have smallholder pig raising activity and risk factors for human cysti-
cercosis including open defecation and free range pigs based on reports from local public
health workers to Sichuan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Sichuan CDC).
Because we wanted to enroll students at risk for T. solium cysticercosis, we only considered
counties where previous cases of human cysticercosis and NCC had previously been detected
by Sichuan CDC or where there were previous reports to suggest T. solium taeniasis [18]. We
further favored counties with the largest populations of fifth and sixth grade students as esti-
mated by demographic data collected previously by colleagues at Sichuan CDC. Because these
mountainous communities are often difficult to access due to poor roads and long distances,
we focused on counties where all schools could be accessed by field teams and where local pub-
lic health services were supportive of the field work.
All schools enrolling fifth and sixth graders were sampled within the three selected counties
and all students in both grades were sampled at each school. We selected fifth and sixth grade
students for the cognitive study because standardized tests can be administered to this age
group easily and these students are old enough to have repeat and significant exposures.
At each school, field teams administered a student questionnaire, aseptically collected
approximately 5 ml of blood by venous puncture for T. solium cysticercosis IgG testing by
ELISA, and provided a take-home questionnaire to be completed by the child’s parent or
guardian.
Student and adult questionnaires
Student questionnaires (S2 Document) covered basic demographic data, home environment
and family asset ownership, animal ownership, pork consumption, and student toileting
behavior. If the family owned pigs, students were asked if they ever saw their family’s pigs eat-
ing human feces or if the pigs ever went to the areas where people defecated. While data on
specific drugs could not reliably be collected, use of antihelminthics was assessed by asking stu-
dents if they had taken any medication for “intestinal worms” in the past year. Finally, students
were asked about symptoms and perceptions of intestinal worms. To assess if tapeworms or
proglottids might be present in the child’s feces, students were asked if they had seen “worms”
or “pieces of worms” in their feces.
Children were also provided with a take-home adult questionnaire which was completed by
the head of household in their home. After completion, adult questionnaire forms were
returned to the school by the child. On the adult questionnaire, head of households were asked
about pig ownership and pig husbandry methods over the last year and slaughtering and meat
preparation practices. Adults were also asked about agricultural practices in the five years pre-
ceding the questionnaire and about their knowledge and attitudes towards intestinal worms
and the administration of medications for intestinal worms.
Laboratory methods
Serum was tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on low-molec-
ular-weight antigens (LMWAgs) of T. solium cysticerci collected from pigs in Chinese endemic
areas. LMWAgs based assays have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific [19,20], have

 been used in previous field studies [21], and are especially attractive—given their low cost,
quantifiable result, and simplicity—for use in low resource areas [20]. Detailed assay method-
ology has been published previously [20]. Antigen for the LMWAgs ELISA was obtained from
cyst fluids of T. solium metacestodes collected from infected pigs in endemic areas of China.
ELISA plates (Nunc-ImmunoTM plate, Maxisorp TM Surface, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Den-
mark) were coated with 100 μl of diluted LMWAgs at 1 μg/ml in PBS overnight at 4˚C. Plates
were rinsed twice with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and then blocked with 300 μl of
blocking solution (10 mM Maleic acid pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% casein, 0.1% Tween 20) at
37˚C for 1 hour. Serum samples were diluted in blocking solution at 1:100. Plates with 100 μl
of diluted sera in duplicate wells were incubated at 37˚C for 1 hour. The wells were washed 3
times with PBST, incubated with 100μl of recombinant protein G conjugated with peroxidase
(Invitrogen) at 1:4000 in blocking solution at 37˚C for 1 hour. After washing 3 times with
PBST, plates were incubated with 100 μl of substrate (0.4 mM 2,2’- azino-di-[3-ethyl-benzhia-
zoline sulfonate] in 0.1 M citric acid buffer, pH 5.3) for 30 minutes at 37˚C. Color reaction was
stopped by application of 1% SDS in each well. The optical density at 405 nm was evaluated
with an ELISA reader. The cut-off point was determined as the mean optical density (OD)
plus 3 times the standard deviation for a panel of serum samples obtained from healthy Chi-
nese donors (n = 30).
Statistical methods
We first characterized prevalence of cysticercosis antibodies, student demographics, reported
toileting behaviors, and reported pig husbandry and agricultural practices using basic descrip-
tive statistics. We constructed mixed-effects logistic regression models to better characterize
differences in T. solium antibody seroprevalence at the school-level, to study associations
between T. solium cysticercosis exposure and demographic, environmental, and behavioral
factors, and to investigate what factors affected the likelihood of children receiving deworming
medications in the year preceding the study.
We identified schools with higher student populations with T. solium cysticercosis antibod-
ies by building mixed-effects logistic models with the serologic result as the dependent vari-
able, school as the independent variable, and county as a random effect. A school with a
cysticercosis antibody prevalence closest to the mean value in the dataset was used as the
model reference.
To build models to assess the associations between risk factors and the presence of T. solium
cysticercosis IgG antibodies or deworming medication administration, we first framed a causal
diagram to identify associations between variables of interest (Fig 1) [22]. In the model assess-
ing associations between risk factors and the presence of T. solium cysticercosis IgG antibodies
we used the child’s serologic result for human cysticercosis IgG as the dependent variable. In
the model assessing deworming medication administration we used the report of the child
receiving medication for intestinal worms in the year preceding the study as the dependent
variable.
Missing values in independent variables were imputed assuming an ignorable missingness
mechanism using multivariate imputation by chained equations [23]. Numeric variables were
imputed using predictive mean matching, logical variables using logistic regression, and cate-
gorical variables with more than two levels with multinomial logit models [23]. Predictors for
multiple imputation included the independent variable in question, all dependent variables
outlined in the causal diagram, demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, and asset score), and geo-
graphic location (school and county). Fifty imputed datasets were generated. Conditional rules
were applied to ensure that imputation did not create impossible combinations (for example, a

 non-crop growing household reporting using human waste as crop fertilizer). Finally, results
obtained using multiple imputation were compared both to available-case and complete-case
analyses (shown in supplemental tables). All results reported within the manuscript are from
multiple imputed analyses. Odds ratios were calculated by pooling results across all imputed
datasets.
For each of the two dependent variables, we first constructed mixed-effects models consist-
ing of a single independent variable controlling for school clustering as a random effect. To
select variables to include in a best-fit multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression model, we
used a two-step approach. Five imputed datasets were used for variable selection, and the final
selected models were run on all fifty imputed datasets [24]. We first used information-theo-
retic model selection to generate all possible combinations of independent variables which had
resulted in p-values less than 0.1 in our initial analysis and selected the model with the lowest
corrected Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each of the five imputed dataset [25]. In the
second variable selection step, variables selected in at least 50% of the five imputed datasets
were assessed by backwards selection and retained if the Wald test resulted in a p value of less

 than 0.05 [24, 26]. To add a measure of wealth to our models we used principal components
analysis (PCA) to aggregate asset ownership variables into one standardized asset score [27].
To identify if exposures and reported behaviors differed between students attending schools
with the highest seroprevalences of T. solium IgG antibiodies compared to students attending
the lowest prevalence schools, we compared the proportion of students reporting selected
behaviors and exposures in the highest prevalence schools to students in all remaining lower
prevalence schools using Fisher’s Exact Test.
Independent continuous variables included in mixed-effects models were confirmed to be
linearly related to the log odds. We assessed multicollinearity between independent variables
in multivariable models using variance inflation factors.
Analysis was conducted in R [28] utilizing the lme4 package [29] for logistic mixed-effects
models, the MuMIn package for information-theoretic model selection [30], and the MICE
package to perform multivariate imputation by chained equations [23].
Results
A total of 3036 fifth and sixth grade students completed the student questionnaire. A total of
169 students refused to give blood, resulting in a final total of 2867 students with both serologic
and exposure data included in the analysis. The highest refusal proportion was in Yajiang
County where 8% (104/1242) of students refused to give blood, this was followed by Muli
County where 5% refused (55/1071) and Ruoergai County where 2% (12/728) refused. The
higher refusal proportion in Yajiang was driven by a single school were several teachers report-
edly suggested their students refuse blood draws and 30% (35/118) of students in the targeted
study population within the school refused to participate. Refusal proportions were 5% in the
fifth-grade population (74/1634) and 7% (97/1407) in the sixth-grade population. The final
study sample consisted of 1016 students in 12 schools in Muli County, 713 students in 9
schools in Ruoergai County, and 1138 students in 6 schools in Yajiang County. Of the 2867
students included in the analysis, 211 failed to return the take-home household questionnaire,
resulting in a dataset including both student and parental reported data for 2656 students.
Enrolled students (Table 1) had a mean and median age of 13; 52% were female (1474/
2847); 84% were of Tibetan ethnicity (2398/2866); and the majority boarded in school dormi-
tories (65%, 1852/2861), sleeping and eating most meals during the week at school and return-
ing to their village at regular intervals on weekends.
Pig ownership was commonly reported, with 74% of households (2107/2843) owning pigs
at home. Families reported owning a median of 3 pigs. Seventy percent of household heads
(1220/1735) in pig-owning households reported that their family allowed their pigs to freely
forage in the surrounding village and mountains. Sixty-one percent (1060/1724) of household
heads in pig-owning households reported that they had observed their pigs consuming human
feces in the environment while foraging, while 21% (513/2425) reported their pigs consumed
human feces from their own household.
Pork consumption was almost universal, with only 3% of children reporting that they never
consumed pork (79/2865). Sixty-one percent (1737/2825) of children reported that pork they
consumed at home was raised in their household. Fifteen percent (431/2781) of children
reported consuming undercooked pork in the past month. In the take-home household ques-
tionnaire, 21% (304/1435) of head of households in pig-owning households that slaughtered
pigs reported seeing “cysts” in freshly butchered pork in the five years preceding the study.
Adults in the majority of households (89%, 2202/2470) reported growing crops. Crops were
generally for household animal and human consumption and less commonly used as a source
of cash income: 96% (2106/2184) consumed their own crops, 73% (1493/2052) fed their crops

 to their pigs, and 30% (635/2148) sold their crops for profit. Human feces were used as a fertil-
izer in 33% (696/2101) of households that grew crops. Human feces were often not treated—
for example by composting or fermentation—before applying to crops. Of the households that
reported using human feces as a fertilizer, 31% (217/687) reported never treating and only
16% (112/687) always treated prior to using.
Thirty-eight percent (1095/2861) of children reported having no toilet in their home.
Forty-six percent (1330/2870) of children reported defecating someplace other than a toilet,
with the two most common locations for outdoor defecation reported as within the village
limit but outside the courtyard of their home (29%, 391/1330) and in the fields surrounding
the village (55%, 740/1330).
Prevalence of self-reported fecal worms and serum T. solium cysticercosis
IgG antibodies
Overall, 11% (283/2606, 95% confidence interval [CI] 10–12%) of all fifth and sixth grade chil-
dren self-reported that they had seen what appeared to be worms or worm segments in their
feces (Table 2). The highest prevalence was in Muli County, where 14% (141/1013, 95% CI 12–
16%) reported worms or worm segments in their feces.
The overall prevalence of serum T. solium cysticercosis IgG antibodies in fifth and sixth
grade students in the study area was 6% (180/2867, 95% CI 5–7%) (Table 2). The county preva-
lences in all enrolled fifth and sixth grade students ranged from 8% (78/1016, 95% CI 6–10%)
in Muli County to 6% (72/1138, 95% CI 5–8%) in Yajiang County, and 4% (30/713, 95% CI
3–6%) in Ruoergai County.
Three schools had significantly higher prevalences of students with serum T. solium cysti-
cercosis IgG antibodies when compared to a school with the mean prevalence in the study area

 (Fig 2): a school in Muli County with a prevalence of 15% (16/105, odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% CI
1.2–4.6), a school in Yajiang County with a prevalence of 22% (19/88, OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9–6.9),
and a school in Ruoergai County with a prevalence of 20% (22/111, OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.7–5.9).
Four schools, three in Ruoergai County and one in Muli County, had no students with anti-
bodies, although these results were not found to be statistically different than the mean preva-
lence in the study area.
Risk factors for the presence of T. solium cysticercosis IgG antibodies
In mixed-effects logistic models consisting of a single independent variable (Table 3, see S1 Table
for comparison of available-case, complete-case, and multiple imputed analyses) and controlling
for school-level clustering, children were more likely to have IgG antibodies to T. solium cysticerci
if they lived in households that owned pigs (4% vs 7%, OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.09–3.01) and if the fam-
ily reported feeding household human feces to pigs (5% vs 11%, OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.07–2.24).
While the odds ratio crossed one, suggesting no clear benefit, there was a trend suggesting treat-
ment of human feces prior to use as a crop fertilizer resulted in less cysticercosis exposure: 6% of
children had cysticerosis antibodies in households reporting never treating feces before use com-
pared to 2% if human feces were always treated. There was also a trend towards more children
with cysticercosis antibodies in households that did not own toilets (5% compared to 8%). Chil-
dren who reported worms or worm segments in their feces were more likely to have serologic evi-
dence of T. solium cysticercosis (10% compared to 6%, OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.03–2.5).
The factors most associated with the presence of IgG antibodies to cysticercosis were pig
ownership, feeding human feces to pigs, the presence of worms or worm segments in the
child’s feces, and the child having been given medication for gastrointestinal worms (see S2
Table for variable selection results). In the multivariate model (Table 3), children who came
from households that owned pigs and reported feeding the household’s human feces to their
pigs were more likely to have serologic evidence of cysticercosis antibodies (adjusted OR 1.81,
95% CI 1.08–3.03 and adjusted OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.03–2.16, respectively). In the multivariate
model, children who reported worms or worm segments in their feces were more likely to
have antibodies (adjusted OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.18–2.91), children who reported receiving medi-
cation for gastrointestinal worms in the year preceding the study were less likely to have cysti-
cercosis antibodies (adjusted OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31–0.90).

 Comparison of demographics and risk factors in high and low T. solium
cysticercosis antibody prevalence schools
Students attending the three schools with the highest seroprevalences of T. solium IgG antibio-
dies differed from those attending schools with lower prevalences in reported demographics,
behaviors, and exposures (Fig 3). Students attending the highest prevalence schools were more
likely to be Tibetan (OR 7.15, 95% CI 3.66–13.99), report boarding at school (OR 3.69, 95% CI
2.64–5.14), and come from households without toilets (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.38–2.46). Students
attending the highest prevalence schools were less likely to have received medication for gas-
trointestinal worms in the year preceding the study (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20–0.66) (Fig 3A).
Students attending the highest prevalence schools were more likely to come from pig own-
ing households (OR 4.75, 95% CI 3.08–7.33), report that their household’s human feces were
fed to pigs (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.18–2.05), and report that they had seen pigs consuming human
feces in the environment (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.93–3.67) (Fig 3B). Students attending the highest
prevalence schools were more likely to come from households reporting always allowing their
pigs to freely forage (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.72–2.98) and less likely to come from households not
allowing their pigs to forage (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.20–0.44). While the frequency of reported
pork consumption (Fig 3C) was the same in both student populations, students attending the

 1.06–1.70), and attempting to treat human feces through fermentation or composting before
use as a fertilizer (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04–1.77).
Factors influencing medication administration for gastrointestinal worms
to school-aged children
Thirty-two percent of children reported having “intestinal worms” in the year preceding the
study (818/2579). Most children reported that they had realized they were infected due to
abdominal pain (55%, 448/818), while a smaller number reported seeing worms or worm
pieces in their feces (20%, 163/817) or had been told that they had intestinal worms by a doctor
(14%, 114/818).
When asked about their impression of gastrointestinal worms in their children, 35% (866/
2469) of adult household respondents felt that intestinal worms had no adverse effects, 30%
felt that worms could stunt children’s growth (765/2469), and 3% (69/2468) felt that worms
could have a positive effect on children. When asked to identify the best treatments for gastro-
intestinal worms, 75% of adults (1832/2431) identified medication provided by a doctor, 10%
(232/2431) suggested a combination of reducing outdoor activity and drinking hot water, and
9% (210/2431) suggested that spicy food should be consumed.
Fourteen percent (379/2613) of children reported that they had taken a medication for gas-
trointestinal worms in the year preceding the study. In mixed-effects logistic models consisting
of a single independent variable (Table 4, see S3 Table for comparison of available-case, com-
plete-case, and multiple imputed analyses) and controlling for school-level clustering, children
who reported their ethnicity as “other” (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.36–4.32) and who reported seeing
worms or worm segments in their feces in the preceding year (OR 4.41, 95% CI 3.29–5.91)
were more likely to have received treatment. Children who were older (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82–
0.97), were of the Yi ethnicity (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.23–0.99), were boarding at school (OR 0.52,
95% CI 0.38–0.70), and were wealthier as classified by household asset score (wealthiest quar-
tile: OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40–0.91) were less likely to have received medication for gastrointesti-
nal worms in the year preceding the study.
Parental educational level and impressions of gastrointestinal worm influenced if children
received treatment. In families where adults reported worms having no adverse effects, fewer
children received medication (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.95). Higher levels of education were
associated with increasing medication administration, with parents achieving a junior high
education or higher more likely to provide medication (junior high school: OR 1.60, 95% CI
1.08–2.38; high school or higher: OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.48–3.79).
The factors most associated with children receiving medication for gastrointestinal worms
were age, school boarding status, level of parental education, parental understanding of adverse
events caused by gastrointestinal worms, and the child reporting worms or worm segments in
their feces in the last year (see S4 Table for variable selection results). In the multivariate model
(Table 4), children of more highly educated parents (high school or higher: adjusted OR 1.81, 95%
CI 1.11–2.98) and with worms or worm segments in their feces (adjusted OR 4.43, 95% CI 3.29–
5.98) were more likely to receive treatment for gastrointestinal worms. Children who were older
(adjusted OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83–0.99), boarding at school (adjusted OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42–0.80),
and who had parents who felt intestinal worm infestation had no adverse effects (adjusted OR
0.68, 95% CI 0.51–0.92) were less likely to receive medication.

 the typical village, is a unique approach and reveals variation in T. solium antibody seropreva-
lence across schools in close geographic proximity.
We identified three schools with significantly higher prevalences of T. solium cysticercosis
antibodies than surrounding schools. Schools with the highest prevalence of T. solium cysticer-
cosis antibodies had differences in reported behaviors and exposures compared to lower prev-
alence schools, with higher proportions of students in the highest prevalence schools reporting
the consumption of home raised pigs, living in households without toilets, and coming from
households were the family’s pigs are allowed to freely forage and fed human feces.
The seroprevalence of cysticercosis in children varies widely in the literature, from approxi-
mately 20% of 10–19 years olds found to be antigen positive in a village based study in the
Democratic Republic of Congo [31], to approximately 12% of 11–20 year olds having antibod-
ies in a hyperendemic area of Peru [32], and a study in three provinces of Burkina Faso show-
ing T. solium antigen prevalence ranging from 2.3% to 0.7% in the youngest cohorts [33].
Although it is difficult to compare results given differing laboratory methodology and our
school centered approach, the prevalence of T. solium cysticercosis antibodies in the highest
prevalence schools in our study seem similar to levels reported in children in high endemic
areas.
The risk factors most associated with cysticercosis antibodies in children identified in our
best-fit multivariate analysis included pig ownership, the child self-identifying worms or
worm segments in their feces, and households allowing their pigs to consume human feces.
The link between the presence of antibodies and a recent history of young children possibly
passing proglottids is consistent with previously published literature [32]. It is unclear from
our study how many children are tapeworm carriers and are auto-infecting themselves,
although given the poor handwashing practices among young children [34], there is likely sub-
stantial risk for auto-infection. Another potential explanation for this finding is that children
who are passing proglottids are, along with their family members, consuming undercooked
pork and therefore are likely surrounded by multiple members of their household who are har-
boring intestinal tapeworms.
The consumption of human feces by pigs results in infected pork and likely results in higher
proportions of human intestinal infestation with the adult T. solium tapeworm. Children and
adults in the study area often report either pigs eating the household’s human feces or report
seeing their pigs eating human feces while foraging in the environment. Free range pigs’ access
to human feces—made easier by lack of latrines and open defecation—has been frequently
identified as a risk factor for cysticercosis [33, 35–37]. The use and acceptance of human feces
as pig feed has been recognized as affecting household practices and preferences, for example
respondents in a qualitative study on latrine use in Zambia voiced concern that building
latrines would result in less available pig feed [38].
Risk factors identified in the school comparison are also consistent with factors previously
identified in the literature. Pig ownership has been identified as a risk factor for cysticercosis
and taeniasis in studies in Africa and South America [33,39], and higher risk of seropositivity
has been seen in households that consume home raised pigs [39].
While not always meeting criteria for statistical significance, our analysis did suggest trends
between agricultural techniques and cysticercosis exposure. Our comparison of the highest
with lower prevalence schools suggested that children who attend the highest prevalence
schools are more likely to come from households that grow their own crops. The use of human
feces as fertilizer for crops has been recognized as a potential risk factor in previous studies
[40,41]. While some households reported treating human feces prior to use as fertilizer, this
practice is not common and the effectiveness of household techniques is unclear, especially
given that consistently achieving the required levels of temperature, pH, and dryness to

 deactivate T. solium eggs may be difficult in household latrines [42]. The role of treating
human feces prior to use as fertilizer and other agricultural practices in reducing infection risk
deserves further characterization and study.
Unlike previous published studies, our study did not show any association between sero-
logic status and pork consumption levels [33,39]. Our failure to detect this is perhaps due to
the high pork consumption in the area and the fact that children, who do not prepare their
own meals at home or at school, are likely poor judges of their pork intake. Additionally, we
did not find an association between serologic status and poverty level [33]. This may be related
to economic status being similar across the entire study area or to little variation in risk factors
with increasing wealth given the agricultural and remote nature of our study communities.
Given that cyticercosis cases cluster around tapeworm carriers [32, 35, 43], it is possible
that schools are acting as centers for transmission in pediatric populations. Schools represent
large congregations of children, and risk for fecal-oral transmission and passage of eggs from
tapeworm carriers is likely high. If this is the case, efforts to reduce school fecal-oral transmis-
sion may serve as a tool to interrupt disease transmission.
Treating human tapeworm carriers with antihelminthic medication eliminates the adult
tapeworm, destroying the source of infection and preventing human and porcine cysticercosis
[44]. While we did not collect data on specific antihelminthic use, our study, which did include
questions regarding administration of medication to treat gastrointestinal worms, suggests
that few children receive therapy. More concerning, our analysis showed that children who are
boarding at school were less likely to receive medication than students living at home. Treat-
ment is most likely to be administered by more educated parents who are aware of the poten-
tial adverse effects of tapeworm infestation. If tapeworm carriers are present in schools, the
distribution of antihelminthic medications at schools could decrease possible school-based
transmission between students.
Our study has some weaknesses that limit our scientific inference. We used a LMWAgs
ELISA to detect antibodies to human T. solium cysticercosis. While historically less sensitive
and specific than enzyme-linked immunotransfer blot (EITB) assays [45], ELISA performance
for serodiagnosis of human cysticercosis has improved with the development of more sophisti-
cated methods for producing antigenic proteins [46]. Use of LMWAgs rather than crude cyst
fluid results in improved performance and less cross-reactivity with other pathogens [20].
However, evaluation of LMWAgs based ELISAs continues to suggest some weak cross-reac-
tion with alveolar and cystic echinococcosis [20]. Because echinococcosis is endemic through-
out regions of northwestern Sichuan [47], cross-reactivity may be causing us to over-estimate
the prevalence of human T. solium cysticercosis antibodies. In this case, we suspect that mis-
classification caused by cross-reactivity is minimal given that echinococcosis in northwestern
Sichuan is more common in pastoral herding communities than the farming communities
which inhabit the regions included in this work [47].
Because the overall larger study was designed to assess the relationship between NCC and
cognitive outcomes, we selected counties and schools to maximize disease based in small initial
studies suggesting presence of NCC and human cysticercosis in the study areas. This means
that our results may not be fully representative over a larger geographical area, as prevalences
of disease may be higher in our area of study.
Some of the risk factors that failed to achieve significance in the best-fit model are risk fac-
tors for gastrointestinal taeniasis and likely failed to achieve significance because our selected
laboratory outcome was a serologic test for cysticercosis antibodies. Our measure of taeniasis
was based on students self-reporting worms or worm segments in their feces. We were not
able to confirm if these reported gastrointestinal infestations were caused by T. solium nor
were we able to conduct large scale stool testing to detect cases of taeniasis. T. saginata and T.

 asiatica are known to be present in the region [18], so some of these self-reported cases may
represent other Taenia species or soil transmitted helminths. Our findings do suggest that stu-
dents reporting worms or worm segments in their feces are more likely to have T. solium anti-
bodies. Given the likely inclusion of gastrointestinal worms other than T. solium in our data
collection, we may be underestimating the risk for cysticercosis associated with T. solium taeni-
asis. Stool testing and laboratory confirmation will be required to better characterize the preva-
lence of taeniasis and better clarify the associated risk for cysticercosis in the study area.
Because we do not have infection data on pigs raised in the study area, we cannot correlate
prevalence with presence and density of infected pigs. Because of the mountainous terrain,
long distances, and presumed limited movement of both villagers and pig populations, it is
very possible that prevalence of T. solium cysticerci in pigs may vary widely in areas that are
geographically proximal but isolated due to terrain features, and this may explain some of the
variation in human seroprevalence. Given the complex biology of T. solium, the addition of
measures for gastrointestinal taeniasis in humans and prevalence of cysticercosis in pigs would
provide a more complete picture of the disease ecology.
Finally, because our study is questionnaire based, children failing to answer questions and
adults failing to return take home questionnaires may have limited our ability to make school
specific characterizations. In this case, however, overall participation in the study across the
entire geographic area was high.
We have shown a high prevalence of T. solium cysticercosis antibodies in school-aged chil-
dren with school-based clustering. These findings raise concerns for NCC in school-aged chil-
dren and possible cognitive deficits caused by CNS infection, which could result in long-term
negative health, economic, and social effects. T. solium is an eradicable disease. Combined
approaches addressing community education, improvements in hygiene and sanitation,
improved pig management and meat handling, treatment of tapeworm carriers with antihel-
minthics, and porcine treatment through vaccination and chemotherapy have shown success
in reducing transmission [48–50]. While further work identifying tapeworm carriers and
potential routes of transmission within schools is needed, our work raises the hypothesis that
schools may be sites of T. solium cysticercosis transmission and that school based interventions
may, therefore, be an important addition to reduce disease among vulnerable pediatric popula-
tions in T. solium endemic areas.
