Abstract
The first contact for patients with obesity for any medical treatment or other issues is gener-
ally with General Practitioners (GPs). Therefore, given the complexity of the disease, continu-
ing GPs’ education on obesity management is essential. This article aims to provide obesity 
management guidelines specifically tailored to GPs, favouring a practical patient-centred ap-
proach. The focus is on GP communication and motivational interviewing as well as on thera-
peutic patient education. The new guidelines highlight the importance of avoiding stigmati-
zation, something frequently seen in different health care settings. In addition, managing the 
psychological aspects of the disease, such as improving self-esteem, body image and quality

of life must not be neglected. Finally, the report considers that achieving maximum weight 
loss in the shortest possible time is not the key to successful treatment. It suggests that 5–10% 
weight loss is sufficient to obtain substantial health benefits from decreasing comorbidities. 
Reducing waist circumference should be considered even more important than weight loss 
per se, as it is linked to a decrease in visceral fat and associated cardiometabolic risks. Finally, 
preventing weight regain is the cornerstone of lifelong treatment, for any weight loss tech-
niques used (behavioural or pharmaceutical treatments or bariatric surgery).

Introduction
Obesity is a major public health issue as it is associated with increasing health and societal 
costs. The prevalence of the disease is continuously rising worldwide, especially in low and 
middle-income countries [1]. Therefore, improving obesity management in primary care 
settings is essential to reduce comorbidities and associated costs as well as to increase 
patients’ quality of life. Numerous international guidelines on adult obesity management 
have been published in Europe, the US and Australia [2–7]. National guidelines [8–10] have 
also been produced taking into account the disparity, specificity and cultural differences of 
each country. Nevertheless, 100% global standardization and harmonization of obesity 
treatment remains elusive. One issue is that the guidelines are used by different medical 
specialists and public health professionals. The latter focus on obesity treatment for a whole 
nation (or a large group), whereas other medical disciplines (such as endocrinologists and 
obstetricians) require guidelines for treating heterogeneous individuals suffering from 
obesity. This means that guidelines should be tailored to the objectives of the health care 
professionals who use them.
Among the medical profession, General Practitioners (GPs) are at the frontline of 
treatment and screening in a primary care setting, as they are the first point of contact for 
adults with obesity. How the doctor communicates with patients is crucial to establish a good 
therapeutic alliance. In this way, GPs play a central role in obesity management, even though 
they are aware that obesity is also a societal problem which requires political decisions to be 
made on food regulation as well as changes to the built environment.
The purpose of this article is to develop concise, practical, patient-centred and well-illus-
trated guidelines for GPs, using evidence-based experimental and clinical studies, focusing in 
particular on high-quality evidence, i.e. grade A classification which constitutes a strong 
recommendation based on evidence from randomized controlled trials or meta-analysis of 
randomized controlled trials.
Since these guidelines are specifically tailored to GPs, we also consider “practice based” 
notions which are useful in primary care, as not all obesity treatments used have been subject 
to experimental studies. For clarity, the guidelines are often set out as numbered lists or bullet 
points.
These guidelines can be easily transferred into daily practice. They are based on topics 
which are often neglected: communicating with patients suffering from obesity and moti-
vating them to change, patient therapeutic education, and avoiding stigmatization. An overall 
synopsis of the obesity management process, as developed in this paper, is presented in 
Figure 1. Different approaches for managing obesity, including weight loss drugs and bariatric 
surgery, are based on good communication with patients, motivation, objective clinical eval-
uation and behavioural therapy. The critical factors relevant for GPs in these areas are summa-
rized in Table 1.

Approaches/measurements used
Rationale/explanations
Improve communication and
motivation
Motivation is essential for adherence to treatment; readiness to 
change will be evaluated over the long term using motivational 
interviewing (MI)
Avoid stigmatization in a health
care setting
Stigmatization is very frequent in healthcare settings; the 
consequences are an increase in eating disorders, which worsen the 
degree of obesity, as well as an increase in depression, suicidal 
thoughts or even, in the worst cases, suicide; stigmatization can 
decrease using MI
Measure waist circumference
It is a good indicator of visceral fat and a useful predictor of 
cardiometabolic diseases; it can be measured at regular intervals to 
monitor the decrease of visceral fat
Treat comorbidities
Comorbidities should be treated as a priority, mainly the 
cardiometabolic diseases, to decrease mortality
Use a multidisciplinary team
A multidisciplinary team (obesity medical specialist, dietician or 
nutritionist, specialist in physical activity, psychiatric or 
psychologist, nurse and patient’s GP) is more efficient; this team will 
work in a network system
Assess weight loss
5–10% weight loss from initial weight is already sufficient to 
decrease comorbidities
Consider lifestyle behaviour
change
Behavioural modifications can induce 5–15% weight loss; it will also 
help to improve body image, self-esteem, self-affirmation and quality 
of life
Increase physical activity
Fit patients with obesity have a lower mortality risk, all aetiologies 
included, than normal weight sedentary patients. Moreover, regular 
physical activity decreases weight regain and the risk of weight 
cycling after weight loss
Avoid weight cycling
After weight loss, particular attention will be given to avoiding 
weight regain and weight cycling; patients can weigh themselves 
approximately every 2 weeks; if the patient gains 3–4 kg quickly, he/
she should not wait too long before visiting the GP to be assessed

Communication in Adult Obesity Management
Avoid Stigmatization
As shown in Figure 1, communication is a fundamental aspect of obesity treatment. We 
must acknowledge that the discrimination and stigmatization of patients with obesity is 
surprisingly common in health care settings [8, 12–15]. This includes among GPs, obesity 
specialists, psychiatrists, psychologists, obstetricians, dieticians and nurses. In fact, many 
studies [13, 14] have reported that stigmatization frequently occurs in different settings, at 
workplaces, in public, in the media, among family and friends and in places where it is least 
expected, namely among GPs, paediatricians, and obesity experts. A number of GPs and 
obesity specialists think that patients with obesity are lazy, non-compliant, weak-willed, 
unintelligent, lacking will-power and even dishonest. Many patients feel their GP is dismissive 
of them, and so avoid further consultation and treatment [12–14]. Therefore, it is particularly 
important to welcome the patient to the medical practice and to improve GPs’ attitudes.
The consequences of stigmatization are deleterious: an increase in eating disorders, a 
decrease in physical activity, both leading to additional weight gain and greater obesity, as 
well as an increase in depression, suicidal thoughts or even, in the worst cases, suicide [12–
14]. These consequences are summarized in Table 2.
Given the frequently observed negative attitudes of some health professionals compro-
mising the treatment’s efficacy, how can the management of patients with obesity be 
improved? Globally, patient management can be ameliorated by decreasing negative atti-
tudes by taking these actions [8, 13, 14]:
1 
Welcoming the patient to the practice with empathy and without any negative judge-
ments or bias.
2 
Understanding that a patient with obesity has already chronically been exposed to 
negative experiences with health professionals related to his/her excess body weight.
3 
Recognizing that obesity has a complex aetiology – it is a multifactorial disease caused by 
both individual and external factors – and that this condition is not fully under voluntary 
control.
4 
Taking care to not use inappropriate or hurtful words in order to maintain a positive, 
constructive and helpful relationship with the patient.
5 
Asking the patient whether he/she is willing to speak about his/her body weight before 
introducing the discussion around obesity, especially if the patient did not come to the 
GP for this specific issue.
6 
Semantically, it is important to talk about a patient “with obesity” rather than an “obese” 
patient; this will be considered less stigmatizing by the patient.
In practice, GPs may not have been specifically trained in patients communication skills, 
in particular with those suffering from obesity. So, in practical terms, what questions could 
health professionals ask themselves before managing obesity [8, 12–14]? Five key questions 
are relevant:
1
Increased risk of depression
2
Low self-esteem
3
Poor body image
4
Increased risk of eating disorders and binge eating
5
Exercise avoidance
6
Further weight gain
7
Avoidance of medical consultation
8
Suicide

of stigmatization in patients with

1 
What are the key messages that I would like to transmit to the patient with obesity?
2 
Will these messages empower a motivation to change his/her lifestyle?
3 
Does the (excess) body weight of a person per se engender bias and prejudice about his/
her character, intelligence, professional success, lifestyle and capacity to be happy or effi-
cient in daily life?
4 
How do I answer the individual needs of the patient with obesity?
5 
Am I listening carefully to him/her and am I aware of his/her concerns and needs?
In daily practice, the following messages and tools can be used while communicating with 
the patient:
 
−
In terms of communication technique, Motivational Interviewing (MI) helps the patient 
to change (see below).
 
−
Some inadequate terminology and expressions used to communicate with patients 
suffering from obesity (hurtful, judgmental, and critical language) could be devastating 
and could compromise further treatments.
 
−
Many patients have already attempted to lose weight repeatedly in the last decade or 
more.
 
−
Explore all causes of medical problems; do not focus only on weight per se.
 
−
Help the patient to select modest and realistic goals (step by step), remembering that 
even a modest weight loss (5–10% of initial weight) can have a beneficial effect on 
comorbidities (i.e. cardiometabolic risks) [2–10].
 
−
Focus on positive behavioural changes rather than on the pressure or “the obligation” 
to lose weight. For example, suggest changes such as eating more fruit and vegetables 
and increasing physical activity rather than focusing on the weight change itself [6, 8].
 
−
Decreasing waist circumference may be even more important than weight loss per se 
[6–8].
 
−
Self-esteem, self-affirmation, body image and well-being are essential issues [6–8].
Motivational Interviewing (MI)
Motivation is one of the key measures of the success of obesity management (i.e. adherence 
to treatment). Motivation is essential if behaviour change is to be sustained over the long 
term. MI is a very efficient communication technique, a non-judgemental, collaborative 
discussion style allowing reinforcement of the patient’s own motivation and stimulating his 
or her involvement towards a behavioural change [16–18].
How do I communicate adequately with the patient, with empathy and sensitivity using 
MI?
 
−
The aim is to develop a pleasant and warm atmosphere based on mutual trust so that 
the patient feels relax and comfortable, as well as building a strong therapeutic alliance.
 
−
The tone of MI is fully empathic and encouraging without any prejudice or bias.
 
−
The patient with obesity is considered to be his/her own “expert” and each patient 
selects, with the help of the GPs, the pertinent changes in the specific area which he/
she would like to initiate behavioural change. A real partnership is built with the GP 
(see below).
 
−
When confronted with any potential change, ambivalence is a natural expected 
phenomenon. The physician can help the patient to resolve his/her ambivalence 
towards behavioural change through reflective listening and open-ended questions. 
The physician will explore the decisional balance, asking first for the negative aspects 
of the potential change, following by the positive ones; the latter should be more 
numerous than the former. The priority is to resolve ambivalence before progressively 
moving on to the subsequent changes. The discussion focuses on goals and values and 
elicits change talk.

There are 3 keys to potential success:
1 
The perceived importance of change must be high.
2 
The patient feels confident in his/her ability to change behaviour.
3 
This change is a priority for the patient. It’s the right moment to do it. 
Another important issue is how to raise the overweight/obesity topic in a consultation. 
A number of studies indicate that patients with obesity prefer the terms “weight” or “BMI” 
when talking about obesity and dislike the terms “fatness”, “excess fat” and “obesity”.
It seems appropriate to give examples of practical generic questions which can be asked 
by GPs in general practice (Table 3). These questions can trigger and help to increase moti-
vation to change [16–20].
Clinical Evaluation of Adults with Obesity
Guidelines for the appropriate clinical evaluation of the obese adult patient have been 
included in the recent European Guidelines for Obesity Management in Adults published in 
2015 [2] as well as in the Swiss Consensus of Obesity released in 2016 [8]. The clinical evalu-
ation includes the patient’s history of obesity, the physical examination, assessment of life-
style habits, psychological status, and the laboratory assessment.
Anamnesis
History taking from the patient with obesity can be summarized in 12 points or objectives 
[2–10]:
1 
Patient representations, expectations and motivation to change.
2 
Measurement of the patient’s body weight over time (from birth to actual body weight) 
as well as exploring the genetic factors, exogenous stimuli and events which have led to 
weight gain or to significant variations of body weight (Fig. 2). In other words, determine 
if obesity dates back from childhood or if weight gain is recent, as this will lead to different 
management approaches.
Table 3. Useful questions to ask to the patient for increasing motivation to change
May we talk about your weight?
How are you feeling about your weight at this time?
How important is it for you to change your behaviour now?
How confident are you that you can make a change in your lifestyle?
Are there any stressful events in your life at the moment that could be a barrier to change?
If you decide to change your lifestyle, what would you change?
What would be the two or three advantages that you could get out of it?
If you decide to make this change, how would you do it?
How did our discussion help you to go forward? How do you see the follow-up?
What does “healthy eating” mean to you?
Do you feel the sensations of hunger and satiety?
Do you eat when you are bored, stressed or sad?
When would be the best time of day (or evening) to be physically active?
What does physical activity mean to you?
What kind of physical activity do you enjoy now or did you enjoy in the past?
What are some reasonable goals you could set regarding your weight?
What kind of changes would you be willing to start with?
What kind of help would you like to meet your goals?

3 
Identification of the reasons for gaining weight. Any dynamic variation in body weight 
over the patient’s lifespan can be reported on a simple graph, and the aetiology of these 
variations should be determined: physiological aspects (pregnancy), drugs, pregnancy, 
decrease in physical activity, eating disorders, psychological problems, child neglect etc. 
An independent proxy of evolving body weight is changes in clothes sizes during 
adulthood. It is necessary to track which phase the patient is currently in: losing or 
gaining weight (dynamic phase) or stabilized body weight (maintenance phase). In the 
former phase, body weight must be stabilized before initiating weight loss.
4 
Evaluation of past treatments and their effects are important, such as the types of 
slimming diet, weight cycling (yoyo effect), failure and success as well as the attitude of 
family and friends (or diet saboteurs).
5 
Degree of motivation for the treatment and its reasons.
6 
Degree of expectancy in terms of weight loss and waist circumference and changes in 
their own life.
7 
Definition of the professional and family lifestyle, in particular physical activity (orga-
nized sports, leisure time, physical activity, keeping active) as well as inactivity and 
sedentary behaviour. A switch from an active lifestyle or occupation to an inactive one 
constitutes a risk factor for weight gain. In addition, losing one’s job, getting married (or 
divorced) or living through grief could be a trigger for weight gain.

Assessment of the psychological impact of negative body image on the patient and his/
her self-esteem, investigating the desired body weight or image, the speed of weight loss 
desired and, above all, the motivation to change lifestyle. An unrealistic objective of 
weight loss or of slimming speed (e.g. 5–10 kg in 10–14 days) is a negative prognosis.
10 Assessment of eating disorders, depression, anxiety, stress, poor sleep quality, psycho-
logical profile and social aspects (family contact).
11 Exploration of food intake and behavioural profile: “What and how do you eat? With 
whom do you eat? Where do you eat?” Location of the meal, at home or elsewhere, at the 
table, watching television, using a smartphone or tablet or listening to the radio. Structure, 
duration, timing and composition of the meals, portion size and number of plates eaten 
per meal, nutritional “errors”, consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks or alcohol.
12 Important question for the patient: “Do you eat mindfully?” Evaluation of the physio-
logical sensations of hunger and satiety, speed of eating, pleasure while eating. Occur-
rence of snacking, binge eating, hyperphagia, bulimia, night eating syndrome etc.
Figure 2 presents a schematic overview of the major aetiological factors (divided into 
endogenous vs. exogenous), which can be tracked by history taking (anamnesis).
Physical Examination
It should be firstly remembered that the patient with obesity requires certain adapted 
tools, behaviours and skills for physical examination. The clinical evaluation includes the 
following measurements [2–10]:
Body Weight
Body weight is assessed in the lightest clothing practicable and with empty pockets, to 
avoid any feeling of embarrassment. Weight assessment should be in a discrete room, out of 
sight of external people and after getting the patient’s agreement. Weight is measured using 
an appropriate (calibrated) scale ranging up to 200 kg (450 pounds). Height is measured 
without shoes.
From the two above variables, BMI (kg/m2) is calculated. For children under 18 years of 
age, ensure that age/sex-appropriate BMI centile reference ranges are used when inter-
preting BMI.
Obesity is classically defined as a BMI > 30 kg/m2 [2–10, 20, 21] (Table 4). This cut-off 
value is not valid for children and adolescents (age and gender-dependent cut-offs) as well as 
for certain non-Caucasian ethnicities (e.g. Asians), in which the cut-off point needs to be 
lowered by 2.5 units. In the elderly, the cut-off values for BMI classification should be used 
cautiously for at least two reasons: first, there is a “natural” progressive body weight gain 
from 20 to 65 years of age in industrialized countries, which contributes to moderating the 
fat-free mass loss with age, and second, from 65 to 70 years of age or above, an overweight 
patient has a lower mortality rate than a skinny one [22].

The use of body composition measurements for assessing both fat mass and fat-free mass 
is recommended for research purposes, but these techniques are not strictly required in 
clinical practice (high cost, variable accuracy).
Waist Circumference
Waist circumference is a reasonably good indicator of abdominal fat and a useful predictor 
of cardiometabolic diseases [3, 8, 21–24]. Waist measurement is taken over light clothing in 
order to avoid embarrassment. Waist circumference is measured at the end of a normal expi-
ration in the horizontal plane midway between the superior iliac crest and the lower margin 
of the last rib [2], using a measuring tape placed horizontally around the abdomen and without 
compressing the skin (Fig. 3).
Waist circumference is considered a reasonably good proxy for the quantity of visceral 
fat and can be used to evaluate the cardiometabolic risks related to body fat distribution. 
When the BMI of the patient is above 35 kg/m2, the importance of this measurement is less 
obvious, unless the two measurements are combined in a predictive model.
“Normal” waist circumference references (relatively strict values, even for certain non-
obese and elderly individuals) are < 80 cm for women and < 94 cm for men. Cut-off points 
indicating higher cardiometabolic risks are > 88 cm for women and > 102 cm for men. Note 
that a gynoid morphotype (low waist/hip ratio: female < 0.8; male < 0.9) constitutes a 
protective profile against cardiometabolic risks [23, 24].
Fig. 3. The measurement of ab-
dominal circumference with a 
non-stretchable tape is not as 
easy as it looks on the schematic 
silhouette. It has a relatively poor 
inter-investigator accuracy, par-
ticularly in obese individuals. Al-
ternative objective circumference 
assessment without skin contact 
(e.g. by a laser beam) is currently 
available but the instrument is 
too costly for GPs’ routine medical 
practice [66].

Blood Pressure
Blood pressure is measured after about 10 min of rest in a sitting position (in the waiting 
room or elsewhere). Assessment of blood pressure is done using a cuff size (XXL) adapted to 
the circumference of the patient’s upper arm. Longitudinal home monitoring of blood pressure 
by the patient (using an accurate and precise sphingomanometer) could add valuable infor-
mation for GPs, which may reduce the well-known “white coat” effect.
Comorbidities Status
Enquiry for comorbidities. The sequence is to explore clinical symptoms and signs of the 
main comorbidities by making a complete medical status (diabetes type 2, hypertension, 
cardiovascular disease, asthma, sleep apnoea syndrome, gallbladder disease, NASH (non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis), osteoarthritis, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, breast cancer etc). 
Identify “metabolically healthy” obesity, especially when the patient has a high cardiorespi-
ratory fitness [25]. Look for acanthosis nigricans (brown colouration of the skin on the neck 
or in the armpits) related to insulin resistance [26, 27]. The different comorbidities asso-
ciated with obesity are shown in Figure 4.
Metabolic Syndrome
Patients who present a metabolic syndrome are prone to develop cardiometabolic 
disease and especially type 2 diabetes [28].
Five criteria for metabolic syndrome (International Diabetes Federation definition, 
https://www.idf.org/e-library/consensus-statements/60-idfconsensus-worldwide-definition-
of-the-metabolic-syndrome.html) have been defined as follows (no. 1 plus other 2 criteria have 
to be fulfilled for diagnosis of metabolic syndrome):

Laboratory Assessment
Laboratory assessment constitutes a valuable part of the evaluation of the patient at 
baseline and should be based on clinical evaluation. It is an objective measurement which 
complements history taking and clinical evaluation [2–10].
A summary of the appropriate laboratory assessment used in obesity management is 
given below. The maximum laboratory evaluation includes 10 assessments, but in practice 
fewer measurements may be necessary. The first 4 are the most important.
1 
Fasting blood glucose
2 
Lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides)
3 
Liver function (GOT, GPT, Gamma GT), with liver investigation (ultrasound, biopsy), if 
elevated liver enzymes
4 
Kidney function (creatinine)
5 
Index of inflammation (Hs-CRP, ferritin)
6 
Uric acid in blood, if gout
7 
Thyroid function (TSH)
8 
Cardiovascular assessment (ergometry, echocardiography), if indicated
9 
Sleep apnoea investigation, if indicated
10 Endocrine investigations (Cushing, hypothalamic disease), if clinically indicated.
Obesity Treatment
Treatment Goals
The principal goals in obesity management are to prevent complications by trying to 
keep the patient metabolically healthy (if possible), to prevent or to treat comorbidities if 
they are already present, to fight against stigmatization and to restore well-being, positive 
body image and self-esteem. Body weight loss per se is not considered the first priority. Moti-
vation to change is supported over the long term [2–10].
The treatment goals will be obviously tailored to the complications. Table 5 (adapted 
from [3]) summarizes the actions to be taken. The predictive weight loss is also given as an 
indicator of what could be achieved to decrease cardiometabolic risks. These range from 5 to 
15% of expected weight loss depending on the pathology. It is known that this amount of 
weight loss to be achieved, at least in the medium term, is possible with behavioural treatment.
Comprehensive Adult Obesity Management in General Practice [2–10]
GPs are aware that a patient with obesity entering the medical practice may not be coming 
for this issue but for other medical problems. A simple algorithm is proposed to clarify, step 
by step, the possible actions to be taken for comprehensive obesity management in adulthood 
(Fig. 5).
GPs are dealing with heterogeneous patients, with different backgrounds and levels of 
education. The medical jargon during the consultation can be a barrier to the patient’s under-
standing of the disease. Educating the patient is, as a result, a very important phase of the

treatment. Patient education will improve the therapeutic efficiency and the patient’s moti-
vation to change in the long term [29, 30]. It should enable patients to increase and keep 
abilities and skills which will help them to live with their disease. It is a permanent process 
included in lifelong treatment. In addition, it is patient-centred, involving awareness of how 
obesity leads to comorbidities and learning a process of self-management, psychological 
support and health behaviours. Patient education aims to help patients and their family to 
better understand obesity, to live healthier lives and to improve body image, self-esteem and 
quality of life, taking into account their beliefs and representation about their disease. One 
should address patients’ subjective and objective needs and help them to become progres-
sively self-supporting.
Considering the large inter-individual variability of patients with obesity, each with their 
own beliefs, family history and positive or negative attitudes towards a proposed treatment, 
it is fundamental to let the patient choose the area they feel able to make behavioural changes. 
As shown in Figure 6, there are three complementary areas: nutrition, physical activity, eating 
behaviour and psychological aspects. An overview of the decisions to be taken according to 
the level of cardiometabolic risks estimated from BMI and waist circumference is shown in 
Table 6 (adapted from [2]). The initial level of intervention is discussed with the patient.
Lifestyle and Behavioural Therapy
General Considerations [2–10, 31–35]
The role of a GP is not to shame but to avoid stigmatization of patients with obesity by 
encouraging, motivating and supporting them in their choices in a real partnership with the 
patient.
Ideally, an interdisciplinary team made up of the patient’s GP, an obesity medical 
specialist, a dietician or nutritionist, a specialist in physical activity, a psychologist or psychi-

atrist and a nurse will look after the patient. This team should work in a network system. 
Patients may benefit from joining a self-help group if possible.
The goals, in terms of weight loss and speed of slimming, must be achievable and 
progressive (5–10% of initial weight). The goal will focus more on lifestyle changes, body 
composition and decreasing waist circumference than on weight loss per se.
The patient is considered his/her own expert and chooses the area for behaviour modi-
fication with the support of his/her GP or obesity expert (Fig. 6).
The degree of motivation can be enhanced by using MI.
Patient education is relevant to help patients learn about their health. The use of thera-
peutic patient education clearly shows an improvement in health outcomes including quality 
of life. The approach includes nutrition, eating behaviour, physical activity and inactivity, 
stimulus control, systematic approaches for problem solving, stress reduction, cognitive 
behavioural therapy, psychological counselling or therapy, treatment of eating disorders, 
anxiety and depression as well as mobilization of social support structures through patient 
education [29, 30]. It will also help to improve body image, self-esteem, self-affirmation and 
quality of life.
The different areas in which the patient finds a way to optimize his/her motivation and 
adherence to the treatments is shown above (Fig. 6). It includes i) nutrition and eating 
behaviour ii) physical activity and inactivity behaviours and iii) psychological aspects such as 
stress management.

ing the consultation in order to help him/her choose which area they would like to initiate behavioural mod-
ification.

Nutrition and Eating Behaviour [8, 11, 31–37]
A number of patients with obesity no longer recognize the physiological sensations of 
hunger and satiety which control food intake. Therefore, they eat because it is time to eat, 
because they want to, for emotional compensation or as a reflex. The first step is therefore 
the most important: to recover the physiological sensations of hunger and satiety through 
practical exercises at home. This will determine food and energy intake and help to maintain 
metabolic equilibrium. It is essential to recognize the hunger sensation which reappears 
progressively 4–5 h after a “normal” meal – that of a “hole” in the stomach accompanied by 
noise. Waiting too long can be counterproductive because it could lead to a caloric overcon-
sumption. It is important to eat quietly without perturbation or being involved in anything 
else (watching television, using a smartphone or tablet, listening to the radio, walking, reading 
a magazine etc.).
One approach is to eat slowly and mindfully [36], to smell the food before eating, to chew 
carefully, to keep it in the mouth to detect all the different textures, flavours and tastes; this 
will help to identify satiety. This sensation will appear about 20 min after the beginning of the 
meal and will contribute to the control of food intake. Step by step, the pleasure of eating will 
decrease until the end of the meal when full satiety occurs. The aim is to perceive the act of 
eating through all our senses, to recover the pleasure of eating and to avoid the perverted 
automatic behavioural reactions which lead to overeating. Practical tips for patients are 
presented in Table 7.
A schematic illustration (Fig. 7) provides a simplified approach for selecting appropriate 
food items on a normal size plate, considering that about one quarter of the area is covered 
by a source of protein (meat, poultry, fish, cheese, egg, lentils etc.) and the remaining part by 
starchy (non-sugar cereals) and other non-refined carbohydrate food as well as fruit and 
vegetables. The Mediterranean diet should be promoted. This diet has a high content of vege-
tables, fruits, legumes, complex starches and food rich in omega-3 fatty acid like fatty fish, 
Table 7. General nutritional and behavioural advice given to the patient with obesity
1
Decrease energy density of food; increase vegetables and eat two portions of fruit per day; decrease 
fatty foods, especially saturated fat; decrease refined carbohydrates, sugar and sweetened beverages; 
decrease portion size, use a smaller plate and eat only one portion per meal
2
Avoid snacking and skipping meals (breakfast, for example: if you are not hungry early in the morning, 
you can eat your breakfast later, when you will feel hungrier)
3
Eat only in response to your sensation of hunger and stop when you feel a sensation of satiety; avoid 
eating if you are not hungry and avoid finishing your food if you feel full before the end of your meal
4
Eat slowly: a sensation of satiety will appear after about 20 min after the beginning of the meal
5
Eat mindfully
a Take a moment to relax, listen to your favourite music, and try to anticipate the meal to come
b Sit down at a table (no standing or walking) to eat without doing anything else (television, 
smartphone, tablet, radio, reading, etc.)
c Be aware of how the intensity of your hunger sensation decreases progressively throughout the meal
d Eat slowly and enjoy it, paying attention to the tastes, flavours, textures and temperature of the food; 
put down your knife and fork between bites
e Observe your emotions while eating
f
Stop eating when you feel full and the pleasure of eating decreases
6
Keep a diary so you become aware of your eating behaviour (snacking, volume of meals etc.) and to 
identify the triggers for eating when you are not hungry (watching television, using a smartphone or 
tablet, walking past a bakery, feeling bored or frustrated etc.)

nuts, goat’s cheese and mountain cheese. Rapeseed oil is also rich in omega-3 fatty acid. The 
diet also includes olive oil and avocado. A meta-analysis on the Mediterranean diet signifi-
cantly revealed an 8% reduction of death from all causes, a 10% reduction from death and/
or incidence of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases, a 6% reduction from death and/or the 
incidence of neoplastic diseases and a 13% reduction of the incidence of neurodegenerative 
diseases [37].
Physical Activity and Inactivity [8, 11, 39–45]
Today we consider that both physical activity and inactivity (i.e. doing insufficient 
physical activity in daily life) have to be dealt with in conjunction as both factors are interre-
lated: a net increase in physical activity will automatically decrease inactivity and vice versa, 
provided no compensation occurs.
An important message that can be given to the patient is that some recent studies and 
meta-analyses have shown that people with obesity who reached a high cardiorespiratory 
fitness have a lower mortality risk due to all aetiologies than normal-weight sedentary 
patients, namely those who sit or lie down for a prolonged period of time [39]. This message 
could be a motivation to increase physical activity in some patients. Moreover, the anatomical 
distribution of adipose tissue is very important: gynoid patients are protected from cardio-
metabolic disease by the subcutaneous adipose tissue (gluteal region). Visceral fat promotes 
cardiometabolic disease [40, 41]. Regular physical activity mobilizes visceral fat and decreases 
the risks of comorbidities.
About 300 min/week of endurance activity at moderate intensity or 150 min of more 
intense activity is sufficient to mobilize visceral fat [39–41, 43]. Physical activity can be split 
into multiple short segments of 10 min minimum in order to have a metabolic impact.
The general prescription for the population is at least of 150 min/week of moderate 
aerobic activity, equivalent to walking at 5–6 km/h. Doing sport is not crucial. Walking 
remains the best physical activity/exercise for both normal-weight/overweight and patients 
with obesity for the following reasons:
Fig. 7. The plate (“normal” size) 
shows the typical balanced Medi-
terranean style diet, which is used 
as a model to show the proportion 
represented by each of the com-
ponents: about half for vegeta-
bles, about one quarter for food 
rich in protein (meat, fish, cheese 
and legumes) and the last quarter 
for starchy food including cereals 
and grains. Fruits are shown on 
the periphery of the plate because 
they can be eaten between meals 
(apples, berries, etc.). (From:

3 
The patient can decide (self-tune) on the intensity of exercise as part of the self-deter-
mined adjustment of speed, selection of slopes (positive or negative grade) and a 
particular terrain (walking in snow/sand).
If a GP prescribes walking [44], 30 min/day (or 2 × 15 or 3 × 10 min) 5 days per week is 
an appropriate duration for overweight patients and patients with obesity. This prescription 
requires a progressive increase in volume and intensity of physical activity. When the total 
duration of exercise is longer than 30 min (60 or 90 min), adherence to exercise may decrease 
and, as a double burden, compensation to the added exercise could occur, namely an increased 
placidity during the post-exercise period [44]. In order to increase total physical activity to 
45 min, about 60 min of walking should be prescribed, since compliance tends to diminish 
with the duration of exercise.
Physical activity can be combined with 2–3 sessions of resistance exercise at least twice 
a week comprising 8–10 exercises involving large muscle groups.
Some examples of adapted sports for patients with obesity are: swimming, aqua 
gymnastics, Nordic walking, cycling, dancing, judo, cross-country skiing, golf, hiking, table 
tennis, muscle strengthening and cardio training under supervision.
The aim is to decrease physical inactivity (sitting time) as well as increase physical 
activity (= replacement effect) and recover the pleasure of moving and being active as much 
as possible by selecting appropriate physical activity. Note that any strenuous exercise in a 
patient with obesity requires a cardiac assessment by a cardiologist using an exercise stress 
test [45]. Moderate workload (e.g. walking, non-competitive swimming etc.) does not require 
this test, except for patients with existing comorbidities, in particular type 2 diabetes.
A schematic diagram is shown in Figure 8, visualizing the guidelines in terms of the type 
of physical activity, its effects on body composition and its duration expressed as an average 
number of minutes each activity should be performed to maximize health.
Psychological Aspects [2–11]
Psychological factors are very important for obesity management and strongly influence 
the success of the treatment, in particular in individuals suffering from severe obesity (class 
III). Eating disorders such as binge eating, night eating syndrome and severe multiple snacking 
should be treated by a psychiatrist, a psychologist or an obesity specialist with cognitive 
behavioural therapy.
Generally, there is a close relationship between the emotional state and stressful situa-
tions on the one hand and the desire or need to eat on the other. Becoming aware of the 
emotional relationship with food is the basis of the treatment. The objective is to decrease 
eating compulsions and to find new strategies to answer and mitigate these emotions, 
managing emotions in other ways than eating. It is also important to discuss the patient’s 
knowledge of food and nutrition.
Eating disorders are defined by DSM V [46, 47], comprising snacking and isolated or 
irregular compulsive disorders or binge eating, all of which are common in individuals 
suffering from obesity.
Binge eating disorder is defined as follows:
1 
Ingestion of a very large quantity of food in a very limited period of time
2 
Deep sensation of loss of control of eating behaviour during the binge (for example, 
feeling to be unable to stop eating)
3 
The binge episodes are associated with 3 (or more) of the following characteristics:
 
−
Eating far more quickly than usual (speed of eating)
 
−
Eating excessively until a painful feeling of gastric distension occurs

−
Eating a large quantity of food without any sensation of hunger
 
−
Eating in isolation because of the shame of eating so much and so quickly
 
−
Feeling disgusted by oneself, depressed or guilty of the enormous amount of food 
 
which has been eaten in a short period of time
4 
This binge is source of deep distress
5 
This binge occurs at least twice a week for 6 months or more
6 
This behaviour is not associated with inappropriate compensatory behaviours such as 
vomiting or compensatory exercises.
GPs may look for these disorders in the following sequences:
 
−
First, hunger sensation, appetite and satiety or restrictive behaviour
 
−
Then, snacking, compulsive eating, binge eating or night eating syndrome
 
−
Patient’s eating reactions towards positive or negative emotions
 
−
Compensatory behaviours.
There is a positive relationship between the severity of the obesity and the occurrence of 
binge eating, as well as with weight cycling and depression.
The treatment of eating disorders should be managed by specialists (psychiatrists, 
psychologists). Cognitive behavioural therapy has shown good results [46]:
1 
The first step is to increase the motivation to change using MI
2 
The second is to restructure the meal pattern during the day: three meals a day, allowing 
breaks between meals to be able to discern the physiological sensation of hunger and satiety

since the more time spent sedentary in daily life, the less time is available for exercise.

It is important not to restrict eating and to explore and learn to detect exogenous or 
endogenous stimuli which can lead to loss of control. Triggers are linked with food and 
emotions, such as being exposed to a person who is eating, forbidden food, skipping 
meals which leads to excess hunger, smelling food and feelings of stress, loneliness, 
boredom, inactivity, conflict, tiredness, sense of failure etc.
4 
The patient will be helped to find his/her own strategies to avoid snacking or compulsive 
disorders and to identify the triggers related to emotion, to identify and express his/her 
emotions in other ways and to enjoy getting out of the house or kitchen
5 
Finally, explore and identify automatic negative thoughts should be identified. The 
patient will learn to identify negative thoughts and put them in perspective, to deal with 
emotion in other ways than eating, to look for positive thoughts and to evaluate anxiety 
and depression.
Psychotherapy is often necessary to treat depression and anxiety. Body image, self-
esteem and self-confidence may also be improved by psychotherapy. Art therapy, dance 
therapy, role playing, hypnosis and gestalt therapy can also help to enhance quality of life.
Patients suffering from a compulsive eating disorder have very low self-esteem, which is 
worsened by the loss of control and results in deep distress. So significant work can be done 
to improve body image, self-esteem, self-confidence, self-affirmation and quality of life in 
individual therapy or in group therapy.
Pharmacotherapy [2–8, 48, 49]
Anti-obesity drug therapy and drug therapy of comorbidities can complement lifestyle 
therapy but can never be used alone. Anti-obesity drugs are suitable for patients with BMI > 
30 kg/m2 or with BMI > 27 kg/m2 with comorbidities. There are responders and non-
responders to the anti-obesity drugs. A 5% weight loss in non-diabetic patients and > 3% 
weight loss in diabetic patients should be achieved after 3-month treatment. If this is not the 
case, the anti-obesity drug should be interrupted. Weight loss drugs should not be used in 
pregnancy, lactation and childhood.
Today (in 2018), very few obesity drugs are available on the market: only 3 drugs received 
approval for clinical use in obesity management in Europe: orlistat, liraglutide and the combi-
nation of bupropion/naltrexone. The availability of these drugs varies within European coun-
tries, and they can be subjected to prescription limitations according to national rules.
 
−
Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue (GLP-1). It is an incretin E (intestinal 
hormone) which is secreted by the ileum in response to a meal. It belongs to the class of 
satiety hormones. It induces an increase of insulin secretion by the pancreas and sends 
a message of satiety to the brain. It is injectable and lasts about 24 h. It is already used 
to treat type 2 diabetes with a dose of 0.8–1.8 mg/day. A dosage of 3 mg has been 
available on the market since 2015 for the treatment of obesity in Europe. It is 
generally well tolerated, except for side effects such as nausea and vomiting which may 
occur at the beginning of the treatment. In patients with cholelithiasis, it should be used 
with caution with a slower speed of weight loss and the addition of ursodeoxycholic 
acid [2].
 
−
Orlistat is a potent and selective inhibitor of pancreatic lipase that reduces intestinal 
absorption of fat. The drug is available over the counter at a dose of 60 mg/day and a 
prescription dosage of 120 mg/day. Both forms are given before each (fatty) meal and 
produce a moderate absolute and placebo-subtracted weight loss. Faecal fat loss and 
related gastrointestinal symptoms (fatty diarrhoea) are common. It may cause small 
decreases in fat-soluble vitamins; thus a multivitamin complement can be prescribed [1].

Bupropion/naltrexone combines two centrally acting medications that have already 
been approved. Bupropion is used for treating depression and to aid smoking cessation. 
It is a nonselective inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. Naltrexone 
is an opioid receptor antagonist widely used to treat alcohol and opiate dependence 
syndromes. The anorectic effect of the bupropion/naltrexone combination is believed 
to result from a sustained activation of anorexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus. The 
recommended dosage is 16 mg naltrexone / 180 mg bupropion twice a day. The 
product licence requires 5% weight loss after 12 weeks of treatment. If a patient does 
not reach this target, the drug should be discontinued. The most common reported 
adverse event is nausea, which in most cases is transient for the first few weeks of 
treatment. Besides nausea, headache, dizziness, insomnia and vomiting are the most 
common adverse events that lead to discontinuation [2–10].
A comprehensive table summarizing the mechanism, contraindications, dosage and side-
effects of the various drugs used for obesity treatment in Europe has been published by 
Toplak et al. [48] in 2015 and in the European Guidelines for Obesity Management in Adults 
[2].
The presence of obesity and the effects that treatments have on body weight, body 
composition and metabolic status should be taken into account in the selection of drugs used 
to treat obesity-related comorbidities and non-obesity-related diseases occurring in a patient 
with obesity. Drugs increasing body weight and/or with negative metabolic effects should be 
possibly avoided or substituted. Weight loss and weight neutral medications should be 
preferred [2].
Bariatric Surgery [2–10, 48, 50–59]
Bariatric surgery is the most effective and efficient treatment for individuals suffering 
from severe obesity, in the middle and in the long term. The major health effects from bariatric 
surgery are related to inducing substantial weight loss and not to surgery per se [50]. However, 
it is the most invasive procedure to treat obesity and “it may not be appropriate for the 
majority of patients” [48]. Bariatric surgery is considered when conventional treatment over 
a certain duration has failed and if BMI is > 40 kg/m2 or > 30 kg/m2 with associated comor-
bidities, if BMI is > 35 kg/m2 with comorbidities, or if BMI is > 30 kg/m2 with type 2 diabetes 
on individual basis [2].

Patients with indications for bariatric surgery may be referred by GPs to specialized 
bariatric surgery centres, where they can be fully and objectively informed, fully psychologi-
cally prepared and treated by a dedicated and accredited multidisciplinary team [48]. In 
addition, their decision to undergo the operation should be made after a sufficient time of 
reflection.
A summary of the three major bariatric procedures is outlined in Table 8. The ranges of 
expected BMI losses for the three procedures have been taken from Bray et al. [59].
Bariatric patients require additional lifelong medical follow-up and management after 
surgery (Fig. 9). Eating habits need to be adapted to the new gastrointestinal physiology, and 
nutritional deficits often arise, depending on the type of bariatric procedure. The restriction 
of food intake after all bariatric surgery procedures as well as the malabsorption of nutrients 
induced by bypass procedures can cause long-term multiple nutritional deficiencies (e.g. 
proteins, several vitamins, minerals and trace elements). Therefore, long-term mineral and 
multivitamin supplements should be prescribed to every bariatric patient according to the 
surgery procedure used. In addition, periodic laboratory surveillance for nutritional defi-
ciencies is recommended, and appropriate supplements will be individualized accordingly 
[57]. Patients with demonstrated micronutrient deficiencies will be treated with the respective 
micronutrient. Moreover, the management of obesity-associated diseases needs to be modu-
lated according to weight loss. Specific problems may arise in patients who experience some 
psychological difficulties in adapting to the profound changes in eating behaviours and change 
in body image due to the huge amount of weight loss occurring within a year or more. Main-
tenance or relapse in food intake disturbances and eating disorders (which have not been 
treated by the operation) as well as psychological dysfunctions are often observed. Finally, 
relapse in body weight gain (of various magnitudes) generally occurs after a few years to a 
decade. There should be an early attempt at prevention through lifestyle modification, 
focusing particularly on physical activity and on eventual treatment with appropriate weight 
loss drugs [57].
The appropriate medical management of post-bariatric follow-up requires much 
attention. The provision of a post-bariatric multidisciplinary follow-up programme consti-
tutes an integral part of the clinical pathway at bariatric surgery centres, and it will be offered 
to patients requiring it. However, part of the follow-up, particularly in the period directly after 
surgery, could also be carried out at primary care level (by GPs), provided these professionals 
have been trained specifically. The Obesity Management Task Force (OMTF) of the European 
Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) recently released a paper containing practical 
recommendations for the post-bariatric surgery medical management [57].

Summary
For a comprehensive view of the different obesity treatments described above, a sche-
matic summary concerning lifestyle and behavioural therapy, pharmacotherapy and bariatric/
metabolic surgery, is shown in Table 9.
What are the important points to ensure successful treatment of obesity [2–10, 60, 61]?
1 
Avoiding stigmatization from GPs, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, dietitians, nutri-
tionists, obesity specialists and their teams, using appropriate language and communi-
cation techniques (motivational interviewing) and appropriate tools (cuff size, scales, 
discreet room to weigh the patient, chairs without armrests etc.)
2 
Using motivational interviewing to increase patient’s motivation to change and patient’s 
confidence in the therapists as well as in the treatment, and to increase self-confidence 
to succeed with lifestyle modifications
3 
Improving knowledge, adherence to treatment, motivation to change and quality of life 
through therapeutic patient education
4 
Investigating psychological aspects such as eating disorders, sleep disorders, stress, 
depression and treating them specifically
5 
Looking out for metabolically healthy patients with obesity and encouraging lifestyle 
modifications to keep them metabolically healthy as long as possible
6 
Improving body composition (decreasing fat mass with minimal fat-free mass mobili-
zation) through lifestyle modification, in particular enhanced general physical activity
7 
Treating any comorbidities with lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy if necessary
8 
Envisaging pharmacologic treatment and bariatric surgery if lifestyle modifications and 
behavioural treatment have failed and if this is the last option available
9 
Treatment could be considered a success if a patient with obesity has changed lifestyle 
in the long term, improved body composition, decreased comorbidities or is still meta-
bolically healthy, stabilized weight or has reached a weight loss of 5–10% from initial 
weight, improved body image, self-esteem, self-confidence, self-affirmation and 
quality of life and has sufficient motivation to sustain lifestyle modification in the long 
term.

A condensed, well-illustrated version of the present GPs’ guidelines, in the form of a prac-
tical leaflet, is freely available for the public at the EASO website (http://easo.org/practical-
guide-for-gps-in-obesity-management/, accessed October 2018).
In brief, there are 9 key practical messages for the management of adult obesity, including 
communication, motivation and therapeutic patient education, as well as the different 
treatment approaches:
1 
Discuss the patient’s personal situation with them after having collected all pertinent 
results, estimating cardiometabolic risks and evaluating other risk factors
2 
Estimate the patient’s degree of motivation and help them make the best choices about 
the amount of body weight loss, remembering that modest slimming (e.g. 3–5% from 
initial body weight) is beneficial for health
3 
Evaluate your patient’s understanding and identify the potential obstacles to reaching 
the objectives
4 
Together with the patient, develop a calendar and set and promote realistic goals which 
are based primarily on body composition change (fat mass loss) and a decrease in waist 
circumference rather than on body weight loss per se
5 
Regarding the treatment, the first objective of treatment is to stabilize body weight. The 
GP may monitor weight loss and waist circumference every 1–2 weeks during the first 
months to evaluate the efficiency of the treatment plan with the patient and to progress 
step by step. “If there is no weight loss (less than 1% body weight or no change in waist 
circumference) after 3 months of active management, lifestyle behaviours and causes of 
weight gain should be reviewed” [6]. After 6 months, monitoring once a month may be 
sufficient. The GP can ask to the patient how frequently they want to have the consulta-
tions
6 
With the patient, select their favourite specific area (physical activity and inactivity, 
nutrition or eating behaviour, psychological aspects, stress, etc.) to initiate obesity 
management. All these procedures may be supported by motivational interviewing and 
other therapeutic patient education techniques
7 
Treating comorbidities first is important, irrespective of the amount of weight loss
8 
After weight loss, particular attention must be given to avoiding weight cycling (yo-yo 
effect), and the patient must be clearly informed about the risk of weight regain
9 
“Long-term weight management may be more successful if it involves a self-management 
approach, continuing contact with health care professionals and behavioural strategies 
for maintaining motivation. Self-management strategies for long-term weight 
management may include maintaining a healthy lifestyle, identifying ways to manage 
hunger, setting and reviewing goals, and regular self-weighing” [6].
Prevention of Obesity Is Also Important
Primary prevention measures are fundamental to controlling and moderating the devel-
opment of obesity as early as possible in the natural history of obesity. We believe that GPs 
also play an essential role in prevention during the management of (pre)obesity. The targets 
for prevention in general practice have been published [6, 8]. Three categories of prevention, 
primary, secondary and tertiary, plus a fourth (quaternary prevention) are presented in 
Figure 10. GPs play a central role in particular in quaternary prevention, in which the main 
objective is to identify a patient at risk of over-medicalization and to propose interventions 
which are ethically acceptable [62, 63]. It also includes preventing stigmatization, avoiding 
the use of inappropriate medical treatment and management objectives and preventing 
“magical” (i.e. non-evidence-based) interventions/surgical approaches.

Conclusions and Perspective
GPs are the cornerstone of obesity management. They are the first to evaluate patients, 
diagnose obesity and treat comorbidities. They are an indispensable part of the obesity team 
and play a crucial role in comprehensive and continuous care. Ideally, the first task of GPs is 
to prevent obesity. Primary prevention of obesity is essential as, when it is established, obesity 
is complex, difficult and costly to treat. Public health regulation is also important to tackle 
because of strong economic and environmental influences such as the commercial promotion 
of foods high in fat and sugar. Moreover, the longer a patient suffers from obesity, the more 
difficult the patient is to treat. The patient is considered a partner and his/her own expert, 
playing a central role in treatment decisions. He/she is handled with respect, consideration 
and without stigmatization. If available, an inter- and multidisciplinary team including GPs, 
obesity experts, nutritionists/dietitians, psychologists/psychiatrists, physical activity 
specialists and nurses, appears to be the most efficient way of treating obesity today.
Recently, collaborative obesity centres for obesity management (COMs) [64] have been 
developed in Europe (under the EASO scheme) to assure the quality of obesity management. 
A number of European reference centres have been selected, and they have been trained to 
manage complex obesity cases.
Finally, the management of chronic diseases by GPs is paradoxically associated with a low 
level of evidence-based care [65]. As a result, the authors fully acknowledge that not all GPs

Fig. 10. Primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary preventions with their respective explanations. The 
quaternary prevention is a new paradigm important to how GPs manage obesity. It is defined as actions tak-
en by GPs to protect the patients from medical interventions that are likely to cause “more harm than good.”

may be able to strictly and thoroughly follow all recommendations set out in this paper, due 
to time constraints or other factors. Instead, they may individually select the necessary and 
relevant information available based on their own view, judgement and “philosophy” related 
to obesity management. Whilst the authors encourage the ideas around communication 
particularly to be adopted across Europe, we fully acknowledge that some countries already 
have obesity guidelines specific to their models of obesity service provision and which may 
reflect different GP role expectations, for example, where GPs have an awareness raising and 
signposting role, rather than obesity management role.
