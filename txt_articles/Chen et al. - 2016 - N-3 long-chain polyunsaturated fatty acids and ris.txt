N-3 long-chain polyunsaturated 
fatty acids and risk of all-cause  
mortality among general 
populations: a meta-analysis
Guo-Chong Chen1, Jing Yang1,2, Manfred Eggersdorfer3, Weiguo Zhang4 & Li-Qiang Qin1
Prospective observational studies have shown inconsistent associations of dietary or circulating n-3 
long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) with risk of all-cause mortality. A meta-analysis 
was performed to evaluate the associations. Potentially eligible studies were identified by searching 
PubMed and EMBASE databases. The summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) were calculated using the random-effects model. Eleven prospective studies involving 371 965 
participants from general populations and 31 185 death events were included. The summary RR of all-
cause mortality for high-versus-low n-3 LCPUFA intake was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84–0.98). The summary RR 
for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75–0.92) 
and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74–0.95), respectively. In the dose-response analysis, each 0.3 g/d increment in n-3 
LCPUFA intake was associated with 6% lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89–0.99); 
and each 1% increment in the proportions of circulating EPA and DHA in total fatty acids in blood was 
associated with 20% (RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.65–0.98) and 21% (RR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.63–0.99) decreased 
risk of all-cause mortality, respectively. Moderate to high heterogeneity was observed across our 
anlayses. Our findings suggest that both dietary and circulating LCPUFA are inversely associated with 
all-cause mortality.
The potential benefits of marine derived n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) (e.g., eicosapen-
taenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) have received great attention for over 40 years1. Prospective 
observational studies have shown consistent associations between intake of fish, a major dietary source of n-3 
LCPUFA, and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), in particular of coronary heart disease (CHD) mor-
tality2. Experimental and human intervention studies have demonstrated that n-3 LCPUFA have various phys-
iologic benefits, such as improvement of endothelial function3 and reductions of heart rate, blood pressure, and 
inflammation4,5. Some early randomized controlled trials (RCT) find significant reductions in cardiac death by 
n-3 LCPUFA supplementation6. The encouraging evidence led to the American Heart Association to recommen-
dation to increase oily fish intake or n-3 LCPUFA supplementation for primary and secondary prevention of 
CHD7. Such a recommendation, however, has been questioned by several recent human intervention trials8,9 and 
meta-analyses10,11 of available RCTs. Potential explanations for the differences between observational and clinical 
studies, and between early and recent trials are addressed in greater depth below.
Circulating concentrations of n-3 LCPUFA represent a good indicator of dietary intakes and endogenous 
metabolism12. There have been a number of prospective observational studies that investigate the relationships 
between dietary or circulating n-3 LCPUFA and all-cause mortality, and the results have been inconsistent13–22. 
In an attempt to quantitatively summarize the evidence, a systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out 
in the present study.

Results
Study selection and characteristics. 
A flow chart of study selection is reported in Fig. 1. Briefly, a total 
of 493 independent citations were identified after duplicate exclusion, of which 32 were retrieved for full-text 
review. Ten publications were excluded because the exposure or outcome was not relevant to the topic we studied; 
11 reports were excluded because they investigated dietary/circulating n-3 LCPUFA among patients with certain 
diseases, such as type 2 diabetes23,24, CHD25–28, heart failure29,30, and kidney disease31–33; further excluded was 
one publication34 which was an overlapping report of another35 with larger events. Finally, 10 publications13–22 
including 11 independent prospective studies (2 cohorts were combined in one publication17) were included in 
this meta-analysis, involving 7 studies13–18 on dietary n-3 LCPUFA and 4 studies19–22 on circulating EPA/DHA in 
relation to all-cause mortality risk. These studies covered a total of 371 965 participants from general populations 
and 31 185 death events.
The 7 studies on dietary n-3 LCPUFA were published between 2004 and 2015, covering 361 273 participants 
and 27 624 deaths during 5.0 to 24 years of follow-up. Dietary intakes were mostly assessed with self-administered 
food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), with the exception of one Japanese cohort15 in which food records were 
applied. N-3 LCPUFA consisted of both EPA and DHA in all studies and the intakes were estimated from food 
sources in 6 studies14–18 and from both food and supplementation in one13. In all four studies that were published 
between 2008 and 2015, circulating n-3 LCPUFA were measured by gas chromatography. A total of 3561 death 
events were identified from 10 692 participants during 9.6 to 30.7 years of follow-up. All of the 4 studies separately 
reported results for EPA and DHA. The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1. All of 
the included studies provided risk estimates that were controlled for multi-variables.
N-3 LCPUFA intake and all-cause mortality. 
A meta-analysis of the 7 prospective studies suggested a 
summary RR of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84–0.98) for the highest compared with lowest categories of n-3 LCPUFA intake, 
with moderate heterogeneity (P-heterogeneity = 
 0.01, I2 = 
 62.9%) (Fig. 2). There was no evidence of publication 
bias (P values for Egger and Begg tests ≥ 
0.30). Meta-regression analysis showed that the observed heterogeneity 
was not explained by pre-defined study and population characteristics (Table 2, P values for difference ≥ 
0.14). A 
sensitivity analysis conducted by omitting one study at each turn showed a RR range of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81–0.95) 
to 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87–0.99), and the overall I2 reduced from 62.9% to 32.3% when the Chinese cohorts by Takata 
et al.17 were omitted. Three independent studies (2 publications13,17) reported separate results for EPA and DHA 
intake in relation to all-cause mortality, and the summary high-versus-low RR was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75–0.92, 
I2 = 51.5%) for EPA and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74–0.95, I2 = 38.5%) for DHA, respectively.
Circulating EPA and DHA and all-cause mortality. 
Three of the 4 studies reported high-versus-low 
circulating EPA and DHA and risk of all-cause mortality. The summary RR was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.60–0.90) for EPA 
and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.64–0.93) for DHA, with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 
 55.1% and 38.3%, respectively) (Fig. 3). 
There was no evidence of publication bias (all P values ≥ 0.30).
Dose-response analysis. 
One study16 on dietary n-3 LCPUFA intake was not included in these analyses 
because the levels of the intake for each category were not available. Pooling the remaining 6 studies showed 
a summary RR of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89–0.99) for an increment in n-3 LCPUFA intake of 0.3 g/d, with moderate 
heterogeneity (P-heterogeneity = 
 0.01, I2 = 
 70.2%) (Supplementary Fig. S1). There was evidence of a nonlinear 
association (P-nonlinearity = 
 0.004) (Fig. 4A), with a tendency to plateau at high intakes (> 
0.6 g/d). However, 
this observation should be treated with caution because all data for high intakes were from one Japanese cohort15.

Discussion
Major findings. 
In this meta-analysis involving over 30 thousand deaths events from 11 prospective studies, 
both dietary and circulating n-3 LCPUFA are shown to be significantly associated with reduced risk of all-cause 
mortality, and the associations are similar for EPA and DHA.
Other results from observational studies and clinical trials. 
In a recent meta-analysis of 12 prospec-
tive studies, Zhao et al.36 report a moderate reduction in all-cause mortality associated with intake of fish, a major 
dietary source of n-3 LCPUFA. Significantly inverse associations of dietary fish and dietary and circulating n-3 
LCPUFA with risk of CHD have been consistently shown in prospective observational studies2,10. Conversely, 
clinical evidence regarding the health benefits of n-3 LCPUFA has been continuously inconsistent. Mozaffarian 
and Wu5 review the cumulative observational and clinical evidence published before 2011 regarding the effects 
of n-3 LCPUFA on CVD and related risk factors, and conclude that there is strong evidence supporting a protec-
tive effect of n-3 LCPUFA on cardiac death. Nonetheless, more recent meta-analyses fail to show any significant 
protection either on CVD or on all-cause mortality. For instance, Rizos et al.11 and Chowdhury et al.10 each 
pooled data from 17 RCTs and report no significant effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation on all-cause mortal-
ity, with a summary RR of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.91–1.02) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.86–1.03), respectively. Using a cumulative 
meta-analysis, Rizos et al.11 further find that a protection of n-3 LCPUFA on all-cause mortality is restricted to 
RCTs that are published before 2007.
The reasons for the disparate findings between observational and clinical studies are not fully understood, but 
several possibilities merit consideration. First, most of the RCTs, as argued by Mozaffarian and Wu5, are small in 
sample size and short in duration, and therefore may be of a low statistical power to detect a moderate-to-weak 
effect associated with long-term uses. Second, participants in the trials are mostly those subjects who are at high 
risk for, or already suffering from CVD rather than the general populations. In such a condition, the benefits of 
n-3 LCPUFA may be diminished or offset by disease status or corresponding dietary modifications and med-
ical treatments. A recent review37 summarize that post-hoc analyses of RCTs support beneficial effects of n-3 
LCPUFA on CVD prevention among statins non-users, and conclude that emerging uses of statins and less defi-
ciencies of n-3 LCPUFA among participants of recent trials may explain why especially early RCTs, but not recent 
ones find the health benefits of n-3 LCPUFA. Given that n-3 LCPUFA and statins share several mechanisms 
whereby they may exert health effects (e.g., improving endothelial function, reducing inflammation, and slowing 
atherosclerotic progresses5,38), statins may mask the action of n-3 LCPUFA in a competitive fashion.
Third, the association of n-3 LCPUFA with health outcomes may be nonlinear. A 2006 pooled analysis39 
of prospective studies and randomized trials indicate that the most protections of EPA and DHA intake on

CHD deaths could be achieved when the intake is up to 0.25 g/d. Furthermore, the effects on antiarrhythmia, 
antithrombosis, and reducing heart rate and blood pressure (but not triglycerides) also appear nonlinear, with 
tendencies to plateau at the intakes of 0.5–0.75 g/d39. A recent report from the Cardiovascular Health Study21 
demonstrate that EPA and DHA in plasma increase linearly and sharply with increasing dietary EPA and DHA 
lower than 0.5 g/d, whereas there are limited subsequent change in plasma concentrations despite larger increases 
in dietary intake. These observations suggest that diet and endogenous metabolism may jointly determine to what 
degree n-3 LCPUFA intake may exert their benefits to human body. If the benefits of n-3 LCPUFA indeed tend 
to be saturable at low-to-moderate levels, the null effects observed in the trials without taking into account diet 
background of participants are not surprising.
Fourth, it is possible that other nutrients (e.g., vitamins, minerals, and proteins) in fish or other foods rather 
than n-3 LCPUFA are beneficial. It is difficult, perhaps not possible for observational studies to accurately dis-
tinguish the effects between n-3 LCPUFA and these nutrients. Finally, even if n-3 LCPUFA are one of the causal 
components in fish, their consumption as part of a matrix of other nutrients in foods may be essential for the 
benefits. We consider the fourth possibility less likely because of multiple lines of evidence from experimental 
research, prospective observational studies, as well as human intervention trials supporting the potential cardio-
vascular benefits of n-3 LCPUFA.
Strengths and limitations of the current study. 
Major strengths of this meta-analysis include the pro-
spective design of original studies and the large number of events involved in the analyses. However, several 
limitations of this study should also be acknowledged. Since this meta-analysis is based on observational studies, 
potential influences of residual or unmeasured confounders on our findings cannot be fully excluded. Dietary 
information was mostly collected with self-reported FFQs in the original studies, which may introduce measure-
ment error and lead some participants to be misclassified. Such misclassification would likely be nondifferential 
in cohort studies and to attenuate any true association. This may partly explain the observation that the associa-
tions between circulating n-3 LCPUFA and all-cause mortality were stronger than those between dietary intakes 
and all-cause mortality. Furthermore, the common methods we used to detect potential publication bias may be 
of a limited power when the number of studies is relatively small. Thus, potential impacts of publication bias on 
our results cannot be completely excluded.
Conclusions. 
In summary, this meta-analysis of prospective observational studies suggests that both dietary 
and circulating n-3 LCPUFA are significantly inversely associated with risk of all-cause mortality. More large

prospective studies conducted among individuals with high intakes are needed to address whether there is a non-
linear association. Future well designed primary prevention trials that account for nutrition status, health con-
ditions, and medication usages of participants are also warranted to confirm our findings and those from others.
Methods
Literature search. 
This study was planned, conducted, and reported in adherence to the guidelines of the 
‘Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group’40. A literature search was performed 
on PubMed (January 1, 1966 to November 30, 2015) and EMBASE (January 1, 1980 to November 30, 2015) 
databases using the search strategy as follows: (n-3 fatty acids OR omega-3 fatty acids OR marine fatty acids OR 
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids OR n-3 PUFA OR docosahexaenoic acid OR eicosapentaenoic acid OR DHA OR 
EPA) AND (mortality OR death) AND (cohort OR prospective OR nested). Bibliographies in the retrieved full 
articles were also carefully hand searched for additional studies. Attempts were also made to contact relevant 
authors for additional information.
Study selection. 
Studies that met the following criteria were considered: 1) the study design was prospec-
tive; 2) the exposure of interest was dietary or circulating n-3 LCPUFA; 3) the outcome of interest was all-cause 
mortality 4) relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported or could be 
estimated. When multiple publications from the same study were available, the one with the largest number of 
events was selected.
Data extraction and quality assessment. 
Using a standardized data-collection form, the following data 
were extracted from each included study: the first author’s last name, publication year, country of origin, source 
of populations, study duration, age and sex of participants, number of events and participants, categories of n-3 
LCPUFA, the maximally adjusted RRs with 95% CIs, methods for exposure assessments, and potential confound-
ers accounted for in the statistical model. The study quality was evaluated with the 9-star Newcastle-Ottawa 
Scale (NOS)41. Literature selection, data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two 
authors (G-CC and L-QQ), with any disagreement resolved by consensus.
Statistical analysis. 
In a Japanese cohort15, mortality risks associated with n-3 LCPUFA intake were 
reported by causes of deaths (CVD and non-CVD). We combined results from the sub-cohorts with a fix-effects 
model, and included the overall estimates in the meta-analysis. A DerSimonian and Laird random-effects 
model42, which considers both within-and between-study variation was assigned to calculate the summary risk 
estimates. Heterogeneity test was performed using Q and I2 statistics43. For the Q statistic, P < 0.1 was considered

as statistically significant; and for the I2 statistic, the following cut-off points were used: < 
30% (little or no het-
erogeneity), 30–75% (moderate heterogeneity) and > 
75% (high heterogeneity). Potential publication bias was 
investigated with both Egger regression and Begg correlation tests44,45. Meta-regression analyses were performed 
to explore potential sources of heterogeneity according to geographic area, duration of follow-up, sex and age of 
participants, range of the exposure, and quality score of included studies. We also separately evaluated mortality 
risks associated with dietary/circulating EPA and DHA.
Given the distinct cut-off points across studies, dose-response analyses were performed with the method 
proposed by Greenland and Longnecker46 and Orsini et al.47. The method requires the number of cases and 
person-years and the risk estimates with their variance for at least 3 quantitative exposure categories. For studies 
that did not provide the number of cases/person-years in each exposure category, the data were estimated from 
total number of cases/person-years. For each study, the median/mean level of exposure for each category was 
assigned to each corresponding risk estimate. When the median/mean level per category was not provided, the 
midpoint of the upper and lower boundaries in each category was assigned as an average level. If the highest cat-
egory was open-ended, the width of the interval was assumed to be the same as in the second highest category. 
For 1 study19 where the categorized levels of circulating EPA and DHA were not provided, we contacted the 
corresponding author and obtained the data. For 2 studies20,22 where results for circulating EPA and DHA were 
reported as a continuous variable (1-SD increase), we rescaled the RR to a 1% increase in circulating EPA and 
DHA. One of the 2 studies did not report SD values, and the values were estimated using reported inter-quartile 
ranges according to the methods developed by Hozo et al.48. The results of linear dose-response analyses were 
presented for a 0.3 g/day increment in dietary n-3 LCPUFA (approximates 1 serving/week of fatty fish intake), and 
for a 1% increment in circulating EPA/DHA. We further examined a potential nonlinear relationship between 
dietary/circulating n-3 LCPUFA and all-cause mortality by modeling exposure levels using restricted cubic 
splines with 3 knots at percentiles 10%, 50% and 95% of the distribution49,50. A P value for nonlinearity was calcu-
lated by testing the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the second spline is equal to zero. All statistical analyses 
were performed using STATA software, version 11.0 (STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
