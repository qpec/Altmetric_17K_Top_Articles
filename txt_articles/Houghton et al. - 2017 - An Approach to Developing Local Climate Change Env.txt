Climate change represents a significant and growing threat to population health. Rural areas face unique challenges, such as high
rates of vulnerable populations; economic uncertainty due to their reliance on industries that are vulnerable to climate change;
less resilient infrastructure; and lower levels of access to community and emergency services than urban areas. This article fills
a gap in public health practice by developing climate and health environmental public health indicators for a local public health
department in a rural area. We adapted the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network’s framework for climate
and health indicators to a seven-county health department in Western Kentucky. Using a three-step review process, we identified
primary climate-related environmental public health hazards for the region (extreme heat, drought, and flooding) and a suite of
related exposure, health outcome, population vulnerability, and environmental vulnerability indicators. Indicators that performed
more poorly at the county level than at the state and national level were defined as “high vulnerability.” Six to eight high vulnerability
indicators were identified for each county. The local health department plans to use the results to enhance three key areas of existing
services: epidemiology, public health preparedness, and community health assessment.
1. Introduction
Climate change represents a significant and growing threat to
population health [1]. Health effects take the form of exacer-
bating existing, known hazards—such as increasing the risk
of morbidity and mortality during heat waves [2]—and intro-
ducing novel health risks—such as Harmful Algal Blooms
(HABs) erupting for the first time in warming waters [3].
Rural areas, comprising 95% of US landmass but housing
only 19% of the population [4, p. 334], are particularly vulner-
able to the health effects of climate change ([4, p. 339]; [5, 6]).
Natural climatic processes, such as airflow, often manifest
differently in rural areas versus their urban counterparts.
For example, ground level ozone, a key component of smog,
is often associated with urban areas because motor vehicle
exhaust is a major emitter of ozone precursors such as nitro-
gen oxide (NOx) [7]. However, rural areas can also experience
high concentrations of ground level ozone when air currents
transport the gas from the stratosphere or upper troposphere
to the ground [8]. The meteorological shifts caused by climate
change are likely to increase ozone events in both urban and
rural areas, but via different mechanisms [9, pp. 72-73] that
will require separate policy responses to be addressed.
Land use differences can also result in challenges that vary
from rural to urban areas. For example, Culex mosquitoes,
the primary vector for West Nile Virus, find the combination
of vegetation and the drought/flooding cycle in rural areas
an appealing habitat [10, p. 14], whereas, the Aedes aegypti
mosquito, the primary vector for Dengue, Chikungunya,
and Zika virus [11], prefers to live around residences in
urban areas [12]. Both types of mosquitoes and the diseases
they carry are highly responsive to changes in the climate.
However, the vector control methods used to control them
differ greatly.
Additionally, rural areas face different infrastructure chal-
lenges from urban areas, due to the low population density
over large swathes of land. For example, during an extreme
precipitation event, rural water basins can flood faster than

urban areas; however, these areas often rely on low water
crossings rather than bridges to cross water bodies, placing
motorists at risk during flooding events. Furthermore, fewer
alternate routes and transportation options are available in
rural versus urban areas; and, rural communities often expe-
rience slower emergency response times than their urban
neighbors [13, pp. 106-107]. After an event ends, it also can
take longer to restore utilities to rural communities than to
metropolitan regions [4].
Rural demographics include a disproportionate percent-
age of populations that have been shown to be vulnerable
to climatic events. Rural populations tend to be older, less
affluent, less well educated, and suffering from higher levels
of unemployment than urban residents [5, 6]. Of these
demographic characteristics, elderly populations and families
living in poverty have also been identified as populations who
are particularly vulnerable to climatic events ([14–30]; [13,
p. 108]). Population health status as a whole is often lower
in rural areas than in urban areas, particularly in relation to
chronic disease, in spite of rural residents’ spending a higher
proportion of their income on medical care than their urban
counterparts [31]. Furthermore, the fragility of the rural
built and emergency response infrastructure exacerbates the
vulnerability of groups such as the elderly, families living in
poverty, people of color, and populations with limited English
proficiency, who have a higher likelihood of living in isolated
rural areas [32, p. 252].
These demographic characteristics are often closely inter-
twined, due to a confluence of social, political, and economic
structures collectively referred to as the social determinants
of health. Rural populations representing a combination
of high-risk social determinants of health (such as elderly
populations living in poverty in a flood-prone area) can
experience an amplification of the three elements comprising
climate change vulnerability [32, p. 249]—increased expo-
sure, increased sensitivity, and reduced adaptive capacity—
and should be prioritized for investment in both adaptation
and emergency response interventions.
Finally, rural economies are more vulnerable to the
negative effects of climate change because they rely on a com-
bination of agriculture and heritage industries such as mining
and heavy manufacturing [4, p. 335]. Many agricultural prod-
ucts are already facing climate-related challenges, such as
shifting growing seasons and changing precipitation patterns,
which will increase as the climate continues to change [33].
Agriculture and industry combined represented over 30% of
US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2014, with the electric
power industry (many of whose installations are located in
rural areas) contributing an additional 30% [34]. With 60%
of total US GHG emissions sourced from the economic
engines of rural areas, these communities are particularly
vulnerable to the negative economic consequences of GHG
reduction policies. Additionally, agriculture is sensitive to
changes in seasonal weather patterns [35, 36]. On the other
hand, mitigation activities such as reforestation and large-
scale renewable energy installations may reinvigorate some
rural economies and hurt others [4, p. 340].
In spite of comprising the large majority of the nation’s
landmass and a sizeable minority of the country’s population,
less data is available quantifying the vulnerability of rural
areas to climate-related environmental hazards than for
urban areas, due to the challenges of developing robust
statistical models in areas with low densities of both people
and environmental sensors such as weather stations [37].
Local health departments are key players in protecting
their communities from the negative health effects of climate
change, both as participants in hazard mitigation planning
and response [38] and as leaders in ongoing efforts to
build resilience among vulnerable populations [39]. However,
to date, fewer data sources and public health intervention
opportunities are available for rural local health departments
than for their urban counterparts [40]. The Third US National
Climate Assessment identifies vulnerability assessments in
rural areas as a key research gap [4, p. 340]. This need is
particularly evident in the shortage of indicators measuring
the health effects of specific climatic hazards in rural areas.
1.1. Environmental Public Health Indicators. Environmental
public health indicators are a key component of vulnerability
assessments. They are the building blocks for assessing a pop-
ulation’s exposure and underlying vulnerabilities to environ-
mentally related health threats such as climate change. They
can also be used to track the success of policy and program-
matic interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability. How-
ever, existing indicators often do not distinguish between
rural and urban geographic areas—either aggregating to a
larger geographic area (such as the state or county level) or
not providing information for sparsely populated areas.
The National Environmental Public Health Tracking
(EPHT) Program, hosted by the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), shares key vulnerability and
health outcome environmental public health indicators at
the national, state, and county levels for a wide array of
environmental hazards, including climate change [41]. In
2014, Kentucky received a grant from the CDC to develop
a statewide tracking program, EnviroHealthLink, based on
the national framework [42]. The Green River District Health
Department (GRDHD) conducted the project reviewed in
this article under a grant from EnviroHealthLink. The
project’s goal was to reduce vulnerability to the negative
health effects of climate change in a predominately rural
region of Western Kentucky. Recognizing the resource and
capacity constraints at a rural local health department, we
set the objective of using existing online tools and datasets
to bring an evidence-base to GRDHD activities relevant to
climate change. To this end, we tailored EnviroHealthLink
for use at the local level. Using the National EPHT online
portal as a foundational resource for gathering datasets,
we developed climate change environmental public health
indicators relevant to the needs of a rural district. Our second
objective was to identify opportunities for integrating the
indicators into ongoing public health efforts, such as the
community health assessment process and existing health
surveillance programs. Our third objective was to identify
opportunities for collaboration with partnering agencies,
to ensure that vulnerable populations are prioritized in all
resilience activities.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Applying the National Environmental Public Health Track-
ing Framework at the Local Level. The CDC’s National EPHT
Network was designed to compile data on environmental
hazards, human exposure, and health effects into a single
network of standardized databases. This framework enables
researchers to evaluate relationships between datasets that
historically have been difficult to review side by side [41].
Data is currently available via an online portal at three
spatial scales: federal, state, and county. While the majority
of datasets are available at the federal level, the CDC funds 25
states (including Kentucky) and 1 city to assist in compiling
and making public the smaller spatial scales [43]. Fewer
datasets are available at the county level than at the state
and federal levels (Figure 1), presenting a challenge to local
health departments using the National EPHT Network to
support evidence-based policies and programs. The frame-
work presented in this article (Figure 1) recognizes the need to
supplement National EPHT datasets with external sources for
two purposes: (a) to assess a community’s vulnerability to the
health effects of climate change and (b) to establish metrics
for evaluating the success of local climate and health policies.
2.2. Selecting Environmental Hazards for Indicator Devel-
opment. The Green River District (GRD) is comprised of
seven counties in Western Kentucky: Daviess, Hancock,
Henderson, McLean, Ohio, Webster, and Union. It is a
predominantly rural area, with two major population centers,
Owensboro and Henderson. Total population in 2014 fell
just shy of 215,300 residents [44]. All seven counties in the
district have a higher percentage of rural residents than the
national average (19.3%); and five of the seven exceed the
Kentucky average of 41% (Figure 2). The diversity in land
use represented across the district, particularly comparing
the two more urban counties (Daviess and Henderson) with
the five fully rural counties, presents an opportunity to assess
the unique challenges and opportunities facing rural health
districts engaged in protecting their populations from the
negative health effects of climate change.
We used a three-step review process adapted from the

framework to identify which climate-related hazards should
be developed into environmental public health indicators for
the GRDHD. The BRACE framework is a five-step approach
to informing public health adaptation efforts at the state
and local levels. The five steps are as follows: (1) Antici-
pating Climate Impacts and Assessing Vulnerabilities; (2)
Projecting the Disease Burden; (3) Assessing Public Health
Interventions; (4) Developing and Implementing a Climate
and Health Adaptation Plan; and (5) Evaluating Impact
and Improving Quality of Activities [45]. The GRDHD
project completed a portion of Step (1): Anticipating Climate
Impacts and Assessing Vulnerabilities.
First, we reviewed the Third National Climate Assessment
[46] and the associated scientific assessment of the impacts of
climate change on human health [40] to develop a short list of
climate-related environmental hazards with a history and/or
projected future of risk to human health in the Southeastern
US. We then gathered evidence at a more granular level
[47–50] to identify which hazards were associated with
the most negative health outcomes and highest economic
burdens in rural Western Kentucky. Finally, we consulted
with climatologists, emergency management officials, and
other subject matter experts at the local and state levels to
validate our selection of extreme heat, drought, and flooding
as the leading climate-related hazards for the region.
2.2.1. Extreme Heat. As temperatures rise due to the buildup
of GHG in the Earth’s atmosphere, regions such as Western
Kentucky can expect to see increases in both average annual
temperatures and the number of extreme heat days each year.
By 2050, the average annual temperature in the Green River
District is projected to increase from close to 4∘F (under a low
emissions scenario) to 5∘F (under a high emission scenario)
[47, p. 15]. By 2020–2039, Kentucky as a whole is projected to
experience up to 23 days per year with temperatures exceed-
ing 95∘F. From 2040 to 2059, up to 44 days per year could
exceed 95∘F. Western Kentucky is projected to warm more
than other regions in the commonwealth [51, pp. 44-45].
Given these projections and in consultation with the state
climatologist, we defined extreme heat exposure as three or
more days with maximum temperatures greater than or equal
to 95 degrees.
Exposure to extreme heat can inhibit the body’s natural
ability to regulate its internal temperature. It can also exacer-
bate cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrovascular diseases
[52, p. 46]. Heat combined with humidity and extended
exposure to extreme heat alone can be debilitating, reducing
an individual’s ability to concentrate and leading to fatigue
([52, p. 46]; [53, 54]). From a mental health perspective,
extreme heat has been linked with increases in aggressive
behavior and hospital admittances for psychiatric conditions
[53, 55, 56]. The combination of heat and humidity may also
correlate with increases in suicide rates, although current
findings are not conclusive [53, 54].
Population vulnerability to extreme heat includes indi-
viduals on either end of the age spectrum. Both children and
the elderly have a limited capacity to regulate their internal
temperature [14]. Both groups are also likely to rely on others
to keep them safe during heat events [15–19, 57]. Families liv-
ing in poverty are at risk, because they may not have sufficient
access to heat-related adaptations such as weatherized build-
ings and affordable air conditioning [15, 17, 18, 20–22]. Non-
Hispanic Black populations are often at higher risk than the
general population because of a combination of health status,
socioeconomic status, and environmental justice concerns
[15, 17, 18, 21, 23–25, 58]. Homeless populations may combine
increased exposure to heat and cold with other risk factors
such as social isolation, psychiatric illness, and multiple
chronic diseases [59]. Outdoor workers are at increased risk
of negative health outcomes during extreme heat events, due
to increased exposure to elevated temperatures during the
heat of the day [19, 60, 61].
Preexisting chronic health conditions can also place an
individual at higher risk of negative health outcomes during
an extreme heat event. For example, obese individuals are
more sensitive to high ambient temperatures [3, p. 34].
Similarly, exposure to heat can exacerbate conditions such as
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and cerebrovascular
disease [52, p. 46].
2.2.2. Drought. Kentucky has experienced a trend of increas-
ing drought conditions since the 1950s [62]. As temperatures
warm and precipitation patterns become less reliable, these
events are likely to increase in frequency ([47, pp. 13-14
and Figure 4]; [63, 64]). According to Climate Central, the
severity of summertime droughts in Kentucky is expected to
double by 2050 [65].
We defined exposure to drought as a severe (D2), extreme
(D3), or exceptional (D4) drought declaration by the US
Drought Monitor.
It can be difficult to quantify the direct health effects of
drought, because they tend to result from a complex interplay
of socioeconomic variables (such as loss of livelihood); local
environmental characteristics (such as land use patterns); and
interactions between the drought and other related natural
 Journal of Environmental and Public Health

events (such as the prevalence of wildfires or the duration of
a heat wave) [66, 67]. As a result, we did not develop direct
health outcomes for this hazard. However, exposure to fine
particulate matter (in the form of dust) could be used as a
proxy for the health effects of drought associated with poor
air quality.
The population vulnerability indicators associated with
drought overlap with extreme heat, in part, because the two
hazards can occur concurrently. Children and the elderly are
particularly vulnerable to the effects that drought can have on
air quality and water quality [23, 24, 26–28, 68–72]. Similarly,
individuals with diabetes, chronic lower respiratory disease
(CLRD), and asthma are at heightened risk due to their
sensitivity to poor air quality [26–28, 73]. Finally, rural areas
have been associated with more severe mental health con-
cerns (such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD)) during droughts than urban areas, due to
the strong economic relationship between precipitation and
agricultural yields [66, 74–77]. Social networks in rural areas
can be disrupted when populations relocate during a drought
to seek alternative employment [53, 54, 66, 74–77]. This vul-
nerability is compounded by the difficulty of accessing mental
health services in many rural communities ([4, p. 339]; [54]).
2.2.3. Flooding. Major disasters were declared in Kentucky
due to flooding and/or severe storms 29 times from 2000–
2015, damaging 6,000 homes—many of which belonged to
low-income families. The number of declarations over that
fifteen-year period is almost equivalent to the previous forty
years combined [78]. Western Kentucky has historically expe-
rienced 55 thunderstorm days per year [79], with the 30-year
average of total annual precipitation slowly trending upwards
starting in the 1960s and a more marked rise (particularly
during spring months) from the 1990s onward [80]. Average
annual precipitation in the GRD is projected to increase 2%
under a low emissions scenario and up to 6% under a high
emissions scenario [47, p. 16].
We defined exposure to flooding as the number of days
annually with precipitation over 2 inches, as reported by
weather stations.
The health effects of flooding range from drowning-
related injury and death [24, 81–86] to gastrointestinal ill-
nesses [24, 85] and mental health concerns [24, 54, 85, 86].
Other flooding-related morbidities and mortalities are more
difficult to track, because flooding may not be listed as a
primary cause in the diagnosis or on the death certificate
[13, p. 114]. However, it can be extrapolated in some cases.
For example, poor indoor air quality arising from dampness
and mold in the home is currently associated with 8%–20%
of respiratory infections in the US (such as acute bronchitis)
and with exacerbating 4.6 million cases of asthma [87, 88].
Flooding events can also result in power outages, which have
been associated with carbon monoxide poisoning caused by
using combustion appliances indoors [89, 90].
Similar to extreme heat and drought, children and the
elderly are particularly vulnerable to negative health out-
comes after exposure to flooding. Both groups are more
vulnerable than the population as a whole to flooding-related
injuries and illnesses [24, 25]. Children are particularly
vulnerable if they are separated from their caregivers [91–
93]. Both populations are also particularly susceptible to
the negative mental health effects of flooding ([13, p. 108];
[54]) associated with the loss of property and loved ones,
economic hardship, and dislocation. These health outcomes
include anxiety, PTSD, aggression in children, and suicidal
tendencies [24, 53, 85, 86]. The dangers associated with
medical disruptions also led to the inclusion of long-term care
facilities [24, 29, 30, 94–99] and diabetes [100, 101] on the list
of vulnerability indicators for the GRD.
2.3. Populating Baseline Environmental Public Health Indica-
tors at the Local Level. To assess the Green River District’s
relative vulnerability to each hazard, we compiled environ-
mental exposure, human health outcome, population vul-
nerability, and environmental vulnerability indicators drawn
from the literature review for each hazard. Table 1 illustrates
that while a number of key indicators were available on the
National EPHT Network portal (most notably, environmen-
tal exposure indicators) external sources were required to
perform a comprehensive assessment at the local level. For
example, a number of studies have established a correlation
between extreme heat events and heat-related morbidity
and/or mortality by comparing the dates of extreme heat
events with the dates of heat-related morbidity and mortality
data [102–105]. While the National EPHT portal provides
heat-related mortality data for Kentucky during summer
months from 1999 to 2014, it does not provide data at the
county level. Furthermore, the datasets are annualized to
protect privacy [106]. However, county-level temperature
data from 2000 to 2012 (also obtained from the National
EPHT portal) shows geographic variation across the district
[106]. This variation is likely even more pronounced across
the commonwealth. In order to compare morbidity and
mortality data with the actual dates meeting the definition of
an extreme heat event, we gathered heat exposure data from
the Kentucky Climate Center and heat-related morbidity and
mortality data from the Kentucky Department for Public
Health. The Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research Center
at the University of Kentucky retrieved the health data
from the Kentucky Inpatient Hospitalization and Outpatient
Services Claims Files at the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and
Family Services, Office of Health Policy, and from the Ken-
tucky Death Certificates Files at the Kentucky Department
for Public Health, Cabinet for Health and Family Services.
It received Institutional Review Board approval from the
Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services.
Similarly, while robust, the population and environmen-
tal vulnerability data available on the National EPHT portal
are not as comprehensive as the list of correlations in the
public health literature. It was therefore necessary to gather
a number of local level datasets from sources such as the
US Census, CDC databases outside of the EPHT program,
and the Kentucky Department for Public Health (Table 1).
Attempts to gather local level mental health data were
unsuccessful. Comprehensive mental health data is lacking
for most of the identified region.

The project’s short timeline, limited funding, and capacity
constraints precluded the use of statistical analysis to identify
the subset of indicators that were most relevant to each county
or the region as a whole. The project report recommends
filling this gap under the next round of funding. Given this
constraint, which is not uncommon at local health depart-
ments, we directly compared each local indicator with parallel
Kentucky and US datasets, if available, to establish a rough
understanding of which indicators might prove to be outliers
using more sophisticated methods of analysis. Five indicators

were also compared with federal standards: exposure to air
pollution (compared with US EPA 2012 annual standard
for fine particulate matter concentrations [107]), obesity
(compared with Healthy People 2020 Goal NWS-9 [108]),
heart disease mortality (compared with Healthy People 2020
Goal HDS-2 [109]), asthma hospitalizations (compared with
Healthy People 2020 Goal RD-2.2 [110]), and cerebrovascular
deaths (compared with Healthy People 2020 Goal HDS-3
[109]). Indicators were defined as high vulnerability if they
fell short of both Kentucky and US indicators. They were
defined as moderate if they fell in between the larger-scale
indicators. And they were defined as low if they represented
an improvement over both the Kentucky and US indicators.
3. Results
3.1. Rural Vulnerabilities of the Green River District. The
Green River District demonstrates high risk for two of the
key vulnerable populations characteristic of rural areas, as
identified in the scientific literature: the elderly and families
living in poverty (Table 2). All seven counties in the district
host a slightly higher proportion of elderly populations (aged
65+) than the national average or the commonwealth of
Kentucky. Every county except for Hancock also exceeds
the national proportion of populations living in poverty.
However, only Ohio County also exceeds both the national
and Kentucky average.
Of the chronic diseases that can increase vulnerability
to the negative health effects of extreme heat, drought, and
flooding, many of the counties in the Green River District
report higher levels of diabetes, heart disease, CLRD, asthma,
and cerebrovascular disease than both Kentucky and the US
as a whole (Table 2). Due to a lack of baseline data for the GRD
region, comparisons between county mental health status and
state and national standards are not shown.
3.2. Extreme Heat Vulnerability. Table 3 displays the dates
from 2000 to 2012 when one or more county in the district
met the project’s extreme heat exposure definition. Interest-
ingly, two of the most rural counties in the district (Union and
Webster) experienced the highest number of extreme heat
events over this time period. Union County also displayed
the highest rate of heat-related emergency department visits
in the district from 2008 to 2012 (Figure 3).
The elderly were identified in all seven counties as a popu-
lation with high vulnerability. Children were similarly identi-
fied for five counties, excluding Union and Webster. Homeless
populations were identified as highly vulnerable in Daviess,
the most urban county in the district. In contrast, outdoor
workers were identified as a high vulnerability population
in the five particularly rural counties—Hancock, McLean,
Ohio, Union, and Webster. Obesity and/or diabetes and heart
disease were also identified as indicators of high vulnerability
to extreme heat in the same five counties (Table 2).
3.3. Drought Vulnerability. From 2007 to 2012, the district
experienced three widespread droughts meeting the project’s
definition: August–October 2007, October–December 2010,

and May–October 2012 (Figure 4). Furthermore, the most
intensive drought, July-August 2012, coincided with 33 days of
extreme heat exposure (Table 3). During those two months,
exceptional drought (D4) was declared in five of the seven
counties, demonstrating the complex interplay between
climate-related hazards such as extreme heat and drought.
The average concentration of PM2.5 in the Green River
District (14.1 PM2.5 𝜇g/m3) was slightly higher than the
Kentucky average (13.5 PM2.5 𝜇g/m3) in 2011 and signifi-
cantly higher than the national average of the same year
(11.1 PM2.5 𝜇g/m3 nationally) [111].
The demographic picture for high vulnerability drought
indicators in the Green River District aligns with extreme
heat regarding children and the elderly. Daviess County again
stands out from the rest of the region by identifying a subpop-
ulation as highly vulnerable that is not picked up in the other
six counties: individuals requiring mental health services.
Diabetes is identified as a high vulnerability indicator in
the rest of the region, along with CLRD and/or asthma in
Hancock, Henderson, and Webster Counties (Table 2).
3.4. Flood Vulnerability. Flooding and severe thunderstorms
accounted for 42% of natural hazard events and 92% of
related property damage in the Green River District from
2010 to 2015 [48, Figures 4-1 and 4-2] with serious flooding
occurring, on average, every two years [48, p. 109]. The entire
GRD averaged at least 15 days of high water flow annually
from 2000 to 2009, with some areas experiencing 23 days or
more [112]. Figure 5 displays the number of flooding events
in the district reported in the NOAA National Climatic Data
Center Storm Events Database from 2000 to 2015. During the
same period, the direct economic effects of flooding in the
area reached close to $40 million in property damage and $6
million in crop damage [50].
Residents of the GRD are highly vulnerable to flooding,
in part, due to development in known floodplains. The FEMA

floodplain was listed as a high vulnerability indicator for all
counties in the district except for Webster County, because
they exceed the Kentucky (5.4%) percentage of populations
living in the 100-year floodplain (Table 2). Three counties—
Daviess (13.6%), Hancock (14.7%), and McLean (12.8%)—
demonstrate more than double the average statewide expo-
sure [106]. From a geographic perspective, every county
except Webster also greatly exceeds the percentage of Ken-
tucky (9.8%) land located in a floodplain, with close to one-
half of the land in Henderson (43.2%) and McLean (45.3%)
counties located in vulnerable areas [106]. In spite of the
relatively high percentage of residents in the district living in a
floodplain, less than 2% hold current flood insurance policies
[113], further increasing their vulnerability to the economic
effects of flooding.
The district experienced 7 unintentional drowning-
related mortalities from 2008 to 2015 [114]. From 2008 to
2013, emergency department visits in the Green River District
related to carbon monoxide poisoning ranged from 11 in
Union and Webster Counties to 36 in Daviess County [115].
Similar to drought, mental health concerns were only
identified as a high vulnerability indicator for flooding
exposure in the more urban Daviess County. Patients in
long-term care facilities were identified as an indicator with
high vulnerability in Daviess, Hancock, McLean, and Ohio
counties. And diabetes was identified as a high vulnerability

4. Discussion
Comparing the baseline climate change environmental pub-
lic health indicators for the Green River District, Daviess
County’s more urban status distinguished it from the other
six counties, particularly in terms of the need to develop
educational messaging and services for homeless popula-
tions. Baseline indicators for the more rural counties, on
the other hand, included an emphasis on outdoor workers
and populations with existing chronic conditions such as
diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. These differences indicate
that climate and health policies and interventions in the
Green River District must distinguish between the needs of
rural and urban populations in the seven-county region.
While current policies and programs in the GRDHD do
not explicitly address climate change, three areas of current
engagement are particularly relevant to the study results
described above: epidemiology, public health preparedness,
and community health assessment.
Initial research highlighted mental health awareness as
a major weakness in the GRD region. Due to the lack of
focus on mental health within current programs and data
collection, GRDHD will be considering the status of mental
health conditions, the rural impact on mental health services
and access, and environmental influences on mental health
for future grants and programs.
The GRDHD epidemiology program monitors the health
status of the community and investigates disease clusters
and outbreaks. A passive surveillance system is already in
place, tracking infectious diseases reported by health care
providers and other community members. Several reportable
conditions are relevant to climate and health surveillance,
such as mosquito-borne diseases (West Nile Virus, Zika

Virus, etc.) and waterborne disease outbreaks [116]. The
epidemiology department also provides morbidity and mor-
tality surveillance to the state health department during
community outbreaks and disasters. Based on the results of
this study, the GRDHD plans on expanding both the surveil-
lance and reporting arms of the epidemiology department to
track environmental exposure indicators for all three climate
hazards and reportable health outcomes for extreme heat
and flooding (Table 4). Future work may include correlating
health outcome data with the dates when extreme heat or
flooding events occurred, in order to validate or change the
thresholds established during this project to trigger heat-,
drought-, and flooding-related surveillance activities, public
education campaigns, and interventions such as opening
cooling centers and emergency shelters.
The health department supports local emergency pre-
paredness agencies to safeguard the health of vulnerable pop-
ulations during and after both natural and human-caused dis-
asters. Much of this work involves public communication—
explaining the health risks associated with an event and
ways for individuals to protect themselves and their families.
The health department plans to use the results of this study
to tailor heat, drought, and flooding emergency response
activities to the highest risk populations in each county.
An active surveillance program will also be developed to
collect health data on clients of cooling centers and emer-
gency shelters. Example datasets to be collected may include
Injuries, Dermatologic, Gastrointestinal Illness, Pregnancy,
Respiratory Illness, Pain, Dehydration, Fever, Exacerbation of
Chronic Disease, and Mental Health. Furthermore, the health
department will work with the Green River Area Develop-
ment District to incorporate the results of the study into the
upcoming revision of the regional hazard mitigation plan.
Finally, the study results have been distributed as an
addendum to the 2015 Green River Community Health
Assessment (CHA), Climate and Health Addendum to 2015
Green River Community Health Assessment (http://healthde-
partment.org/community-health/community-health-plans/).
The report’s focus on vulnerable populations aligns with
the goals of the CHA. Many of the populations identified
by the climate and health scientific literature as vulnerable
to extreme heat, drought, and/or flooding have also been
identified in the CHA as requiring special consideration
under other health-promoting programs. For example,
the 2015 CHA tracks the percentage of children, elderly,
non-Hispanic Blacks, and populations living in poverty for
each county in the Green River District. Additionally, mental
health concerns and language barriers are highlighted as
areas in need of improvement to advance community health.
The assessment also highlights three Kentucky Health Now
Goals that overlap with the climate and health indicators
listed in Table 1: obesity, cardiovascular disease, and mental
health [117]. Local communities utilize the health assessment
to establish priorities and develop strategic planning efforts
to improve the health and resiliency of their community. The
most recent CHA, published in 2015, focuses on reducing
substance abuse, reducing obesity, reducing teen pregnancy,
and improving access to health care and mental health
services. The climate and health addendum will facilitate
conversations about the links between climate change and
environmental health during the next planning process, due
to begin in 2017.
4.1. Strengths and Limitations. The project reviewed in this
article addressed a gap in both climate and health research
and practice, namely, the shortage of vulnerability assess-
ments in rural areas [4, p. 340]. Its focus on developing EPH
indicators at the local level is also rare. Two examples at
that spatial scale, Reid et al. 2009 [118] and Prudent et al.
2016 [119], developed composite climate change vulnerability
indices based on a core set of indicators. Importantly, these
indices were mapped to subcounty spatial scales to help local
authorities and partners pinpoint the locations within coun-
ties where multiple vulnerabilities converge. This information
can be used to target investment in adaptation and emergency
response efforts.
Due to schedule, resource, and capacity constraints, the
phase of the project reviewed by this article did not include
the mapping, spatial analysis, and statistical validation per-
formed by Reid et al. and Prudent et al. That additional step
is necessary to identify the subgroups and specific locations
at highest risk of negative health effects after exposure to
 12
Journal of Environmental and Public Health
extreme heat, drought, and/or flooding. However, additional
quantitative analysis and validation were identified in the
project report as important objectives pending future funding
opportunities.
The final product may bear resemblance to a localized
version of the output of several grantees under the CDC’s
Climate Ready States and Cities program, which have
followed the BRACE framework for climate and health
adaptation. For example, Arizona has developed maps of
social vulnerability, impervious surface, weather-related, and
county warning area indicators to identify the locations in the
state that are most vulnerable to negative health outcomes
during extreme heat events (http://www.azdhs.gov/pre-
paredness/epidemiology-disease-control/extreme-weather/
index.php#heat-maps). Illinois has developed geospatial
indices at the county level for social vulnerability, flooding
vulnerability, and the effects of ozone on asthma vulner-
ability (https://braceillinois.uic.edu/). And the Minnesota
Department of Health has included climate-related envi-
ronmental health and human health indicators (such as
air quality, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
diabetes, heat-related illness, and Lyme disease) in its
overall data access portal (https://apps.health.state.mn.us/
mndata/home).
5. Conclusions
Climate change represents a significant and growing threat
to population health. Rural areas, such as the Green River
District in Kentucky, face unique challenges that are often
overlooked by climate and health policies and programs.
This project addressed that gap by adapting the National
Environmental Public Health Tracking Network’s framework
for climate and health indicators to a seven-county, rural
health department in Western Kentucky.
A review of the public health literature identified three
primary climate-related environmental public health hazards
for the region (extreme heat, drought, and flooding) and
a suite of related exposure, health outcome, population
vulnerability, and environmental vulnerability indicators.
Indicators that performed more poorly at the county level
than at the state and national levels were defined as “high
vulnerability.” The most urban county, Daviess, illustrated the
urban/rural divide in relation to vulnerable populations—for
example, identifying homeless populations and populations
with mental illness as highly vulnerable groups in comparison
with outdoor workers and populations with existing chronic
conditions, as seen in the more rural counties.
The health department plans to use the results of this
study to enhance three key areas of their existing services:
epidemiology, public health preparedness, and community
health assessment.
