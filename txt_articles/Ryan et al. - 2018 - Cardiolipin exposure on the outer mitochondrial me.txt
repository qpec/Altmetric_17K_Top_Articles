Neuronal loss in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with aberrant mitochondrial function
and impaired proteostasis. Identifying the mechanisms that link these pathologies is critical to
furthering our understanding of PD pathogenesis. Using human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs) that allow comparison of cells expressing mutant SNCA (encoding α-synuclein
(α-syn)) with isogenic controls, or SNCA-transgenic mice, we show that SNCA-mutant
neurons display fragmented mitochondria and accumulate α-syn deposits that cluster to
mitochondrial membranes in response to exposure of cardiolipin on the mitochondrial
surface. Whereas exposed cardiolipin specifically binds to and facilitates refolding of α-syn
fibrils, prolonged cardiolipin exposure in SNCA-mutants initiates recruitment of LC3 to the
mitochondria and mitophagy. Moreover, we find that co-culture of SNCA-mutant neurons
with their isogenic controls results in transmission of α-syn pathology coincident with
mitochondrial pathology in control neurons. Transmission of pathology is effectively blocked
using an anti-α-syn monoclonal antibody (mAb), consistent with cell-to-cell seeding of α-syn.

he decline of voluntary motor function in Parkinson’s
disease (PD) is caused by loss of A9 dopaminergic (DA)
neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The death
of these neurons is preceded by the formation of intracellular
proteinaceous aggregates known as Lewy bodies, which contain a
variety of misfolded protein components, including α-synuclein
(α-syn)1. Although aggregated proteins were first considered to be
pathogenic, evidence suggests that macroscopic aggregates are an
attempt by the cell to sequester aberrant proteins, whereas soluble
oligomers (micro-aggregates) of such proteins are the most toxic
forms (for a review see ref. 2).
The physiological conformation of α-syn remains contentious.
Recently, in-cell nuclear magnetic resonance studies have shown
that α-syn in neuronal cells is intrinsically disordered3. Although
this is a prevailing hypothesis, several other studies have sug-
gested that α-syn exists in a tetrameric form within the cytosol of
human brain, whereas membrane-associated α-syn is mono-
meric4,5. The interaction of α-syn with negatively charged
phospholipids in membranes promotes the adoption of an α-
helical structure6; however, α-syn can also form oligomers of
pleated β-sheets which can subsequently fibrilize and contribute
to Lewy bodies7,8. Interestingly, the A53T and E46K mutations in
α-syn, which have been associated with early-onset familial PD,
accelerate β-sheet formation and fibrilization7,9,10. These findings
suggest that the identification of mechanisms to promote normal
folding of α-syn may be of therapeutic interest. Indeed, although
mutation of the SNCA gene is causal in several rare familial forms
of PD, mutations in the SNCA locus are also consistently iden-
tified in genome-wide association studies of sporadic PD11, and
α-syn protein is commonly found in Lewy neurites of idiopathic
disease cases. These findings emphasize the need to understand
how altered α-syn structure and function relate to PD patho-
genesis in general terms.
In addition to protein misfolding and impaired proteostasis,
transgenic animal studies of PD-associated gene mutations that
focused on the molecular basis of neuronal loss found PD
pathology to be a consequence of mitochondrial damage and
oxidative stress1,12. In many neurodegenerative diseases, mito-
chondria become fragmented, which is ultimately believed to
promote their clearance by the cell’s autophagic machinery via a
process termed mitophagy13; however, excessive or prolonged
activation of mitophagy may, in and of itself, contribute to neu-
rodegeneration. Although data supporting mitochondrial dys-
function in PD are abundant, the link between these defects and
synucleinopathy remains unclear. α-Syn has been reported to
bind to both mitochondrial membranes14 and mitochondria-
associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes15, where it
contributes to mitochondrial fragmentation. The association of α-
syn between these membranes, however, is altered by SNCA
mutation15, and the importance of membrane binding to α-syn
function remains obscure.
The generation of human isogenic induced pluripotent stem
cell (hiPSC) and embryonic stem cell (hESC) models of familial
PD has facilitated the analysis of PD pathology at the cellular
level16, allowing us to contrast A9-type DA neurons (hNs) har-
boring the SNCA-A53T mutation with isogenic, mutation-
corrected controls12. Using these systems, we describe a novel
mechanism in which the mitochondrial membrane lipid cardio-
lipin plays a vital role in the folding of α-syn protein. We
demonstrate that cardiolipin translocates to the outer mito-
chondrial membrane (OMM) in both A53T and E46K SNCA-
mutant hNs, where it binds mutant α-syn, facilitating the folding
of α-syn to an α-helix. This finding was confirmed in SNCA-
A53T transgenic mouse brains. Furthermore, we show that
OMM-localized cardiolipin can pull α-syn monomers away from
oligomeric fibrils and facilitate their refolding from aggregated
β-sheet forms back to monomers comprising α-helices, effectively
buffering synucleinopathy. Surprisingly, both the A53T and E46K
α-syn mutations reduce the kinetic rate of cardiolipin-mediated
α-syn refolding relative to wild type (WT), increasing the level of
α-syn present at the OMM in A53T and E46K hNs. Binding of
A53T and E46K α-syn to cardiolipin leads to significantly
increased LC3 recruitment to the OMM relative to WT α-syn,
which in turn increases mitochondrial stress, triggering excessive
mitophagy. Finally, we show that mitochondrial pathology is
transmissible from α-syn mutant cells to non-mutant cells by
direct seeding of α-syn protein, a process that can be blocked with
a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against α-syn. Using hPSC-derived
A9-type DA neurons, this work represents the first demonstration
of direct cell-to-cell transmission of endogenous, mutant α-syn
from diseased human neurons to non-diseased human neurons,
and identifies cardiolipin exposure on mitochondrial membranes
as a key signal in PD pathogenesis.
Results
Neurons from SNCA-mutant hPSCs demonstrate synucleino-
pathy. In order to evaluate the relationship between α-syn folding
and mitochondrial integrity in PD, we required a homogeneous
population of A9-type DA neurons. Using either hiPSC-derived
clones that allow for comparison of the A53T-SNCA mutation
(A53T) with isogenic-corrected controls (Corr)12,16 or hESC-
derived clones that allow for comparison of WT-SNCA with
A53T-SNCA or E46K-SNCA mutations, we characterized the
lineage progression of hPSCs to DA neurons. Employing a floor-
plate induction protocol17, we first differentiated A53T and cor-
rected hiPSCs into human A9-type DA neurons that were both
microtubule-associated
protein
2/tyrosine
hydroxylase
(TH)
double positive and G-protein-regulated inward-rectifier potas-
sium channel 2 (Girk2)/TH double positive (Supplementary
Fig. 1a). Quantification of these cell types within our cultures
showed that our differentiation was robust, yielding over 80% TH
+ve DA neurons, most of which were also positive for Girk2
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). Importantly, and consistent with pre-
vious reports, there was no difference in the proportion of DA
neurons between corrected and A53T cultures (Supplementary
Fig. 1b)18. Labeling of corrected and A53T cultures with anti-
bodies against vGlut/Tuj1 and GAD65/Tuj1 revealed that a much
smaller proportion of our hN cultures expressed these markers
relative to that expressing TH/Tuj1 (Supplementary Fig. 1c–f).
We next sought to characterize the level of synucleinopathy
exhibited by SNCA-mutant (A53T and E46K) hNs. To determine
the physical state of proteins deposits, we performed a TX-100
wash-out of soluble protein in both hiPSC (Fig. 1a) and hESC
(Fig. 1b)-derived hNs prior to fixation. We labeled these hNs with
antibodies against ubiquitin, total α-syn and α-syn phosphoserine
129 (α-syn PS129), a modification commonly associated with
synucleinopathy19,20. We found that the accumulations of α-syn
PS129 and ubiquitin in SNCA-mutant lines were in TX-100
insoluble protein deposits (Fig. 1a, b). We further characterized
the proximity of α-syn PS129 with ubiquitin modifications by
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and found a sig-
nificant increase in the level of energy transfer in between 488-
labeled ubiquitin and 594-labeled PS129 and in SNCA-mutant
hNs relative to their respective controls (Fig. 1c, d), indicating
that these modifications reside in very close proximity. Taken
together, these results indicate that both hiPSC and hESC-derived
hNs harboring SNCA mutations exhibit early hallmarks of
synucleinopathy.
SNCA-mutant hNs have impaired mitochondrial dynamics.

 of synucleinopathy, we next sought to examine mitochondrial
function and dynamics in this system. We first looked at the
structural integrity of mitochondria in hiPSC-derived corrected
and A53T hNs (Fig. 2a, c) as well as in hESC-derived WT, A53T
and E46K hNs (Fig. 2b, c) expressing mitochondrial-targeted
DSRed (mitoDSRed) using structured illumination-based micro-
scopy21. While control hNs exhibited uniform ribbon-like mito-
chondrial morphology characteristic of healthy neurons, SNCA-
mutant hNs from both hiPSC and hESC backgrounds contained
highly fragmented mitochondria (Fig. 2c) consistent with our
previous observations of impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics in
A53T hNs12. Next, we assessed mitochondrial morphology by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and we found that
mitochondria in A53T hNs had a significantly reduced diameter
when compared to isogenically corrected controls (Fig. 2d, f) as
did A53T and E46K hNs relative to WT hNs (Fig. 2e, f).
Aberrant interactions with mutated or misfolded α-syn are
thought to contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in PD14,22.
We therefore investigated the localization of PS129-modified α-
syn in A53T and corrected hNs with respect to mitochondria. The
hNs expressing mitoDSRed were antigenically labeled for α-syn
PS129, and signal colocalization was measured by optical
sectioning. While corrected hNs had very little PS129 labeling
and
displayed
elongated
mitochondrial
morphology,
A53T
cultures contained a significantly higher percentage of neurons
with α-syn PS129 in close proximity to fragmented mitochondrial
membranes, suggesting that mutant α-syn is closely associated
with dysfunctional mitochondria (Fig. 2g). Quantitatively, A53T
cultures had far more cells with α-syn PS129 on fragmented
mitochondria than did corrected hNs (Fig. 2h). We confirmed the
proximity of α-syn to the OMM using the proximity ligation
assay. α-Syn molecules within 40 nm of the OMM marker Tom40
fluoresce red when excited with a 543 nm laser. Using this
approach, we found extensive interaction between OMM-
localized Tom40 and α-syn in A53T hNs but only modest signal
in corrected controls (Fig. 2i, j), suggesting that α-syn is closely
associated with the fragmented mitochondrial membranes in
these cells. By contrast, no enrichment of PS129-modified α-syn
could be identified on ER or Golgi membranes (Supplementary
Fig 2a, b).
Our ultrastructural analysis of mitochondria by TEM fre-
quently showed mitochondria from SNCA-mutant hNs in close
proximity with vacuoles (Fig. 2d, e), which could indicate
increased mitophagy. In order to further characterize mitochon-
drial integrity in this system, we assessed the formation of LC3+ve
puncta, which when colocalized with mitochondria, indicate
targeting of mitochondria to the autophagic machinery. We
antigenically labeled mitoDSRed-expressing hNs for LC3, and
found that while genome corrected control hNs exhibited a low
level of diffuse LC3 labeling, A53T hNs showed extensive LC3+ve

conversion and induction were also tracked (Supplementary
Fig 3a, b), using starvation to induce conversion of LC3I to LC3II
and the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine to measure steady-state
levels of LC3II. A53T neurons showed a higher rate of LC3
turnover and lower threshold for LC3 conversion than isogenic
controls. We next assessed the functional response of mitochon-
dria to the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoro-
methoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) in A53T and corrected hNs.
At baseline, A53T hNs had a higher number of LC3+ve puncta
per cell compared to corrected hNs (Fig. 3c). Exposure of A53T
hNs to FCCP over a 360-min time-course resulted in a more

 rapid initial increase in the number of LC3+ve puncta than that
observed in corrected cells (Fig. 3c), but ultimately led to
complete clearance of MitoDSRed-labeled mitochondria in both
lines (Fig. 3d).
Next, as an indicator of mitochondrial function and stress, we
measured mitochondrial potential in A53T and corrected hNs by
staining with tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) via the
dequench method23, in which loss of mitochondrial potential
leads to dequenching of TMRE fluorescence at the mitochondria
and a corresponding increase in cytoplasmic fluorescence.
Corrected and A53T hNs were labeled with TMRE and analyzed
by flow cytometry (Fig. 3e). The A53T hNs showed increased
levels of TMRE fluorescence relative to corrected controls,
indicating that the mitochondria in these cells have reduced
membrane potential (Fig. 3e, f). Taken together, these data
indicate that both the structure and function of mitochondria in
PD patient-derived A53T hNs are severely compromised relative
to corrected controls.
Finally, we assessed mitophagic flux in each of our SNCA-
mutant lines (both hiPSC and hESC derived) relative to their
respective isogenic controls using the mt-mKeima assay to
measure mitochondria targeted to the acidic compartment of
the autolysosome (Fig. 3g, h). In this assay, targeting of mKeima
to the lysosomal compartment results in a shift in fluorescence
excitation from 438 nm (red) to 561 nm (white). A53T and E46K
hNs from both hiPSC and hESC origins had a higher ratio of 561
nm to 438 nm fluorescence than their isogenic counterparts
(Fig. 3g, h), supporting an overall increase in the rate of
mitophagy in SNCA-mutant hNs. Furthermore, knockdown of
the mitophagic modulator Beclin-1, resulted in rescue of
mitochondrial volume in A53T hNs, further implicating mito-
phagy in α-syn-induced mitochondrial dysfunction (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3c, d).
Cardiolipin is externalized to the OMM in SNCA-mutant hNs.
At the developmental time point of analysis of 60 days in vitro
(DIV), mitochondrial pathology/fragmentation was already sig-
nificant in A53T hNs, and considerable α-syn deposits had
accumulated at mitochondrial membranes. To determine whether
α-syn was interacting with mitochondria prior to onset of mito-
chondrial fragmentation and triggering dysfunction, we took
advantage of the differentiation potential of our hPSC systems,
and examined cells prior to deposition of synucleinopathy. We
began by measuring the relative level of expression of α-syn in
A53T and Corr cells at the nestin-positive precursor stage (DIV
14). We found that α-syn levels were higher in A53T cells than
corrected cells (Fig. 4a), consistent with previous reports12, and
that this accumulation had begun by DIV 14 and persisted
through differentiation in hiPSC (Fig. 4a) and hESC-derived
(Supplementary Fig. 4a) SNCA-mutant hNs. This observation is
consistent with recent biochemical studies that have revealed that
accumulation of monomeric α-syn was a predictor of disease
pathology in α-syn transgenic mouse brain and hiPSC-derived
A53T hNs5.
In order to understand the relevance of α-syn accumulation
with respect to mitochondrial pathology, we next assessed
biochemically the accumulation of the various structural forms
of α-syn on isolated mitochondria over the course of neuronal
differentiation. We used TX-100 to separate soluble mitochon-
drial proteins from TX-100 insoluble, unfolded protein aggre-
gates, which can be subsequently solubilized in urea for analysis
(Fig. 4b). Western blot analysis of mitochondria from DIV 60
corrected and A53T hNs showed an increased accumulation of
TX-100 soluble α-syn in A53T hNs relative to corrected hNs
(Fig. 4b, c). Longer exposure showed that this was preceded by
the accumulation of soluble α-syn in the mitochondrial fractions
of DIV 14 A53T NPCs relative to corrected NPCs (Fig. 4b, c).
Interestingly, no insoluble deposits were observed in mitochon-
drial fractions. This result suggests that PD-causing mutations
may promote the accumulation of soluble synuclein at the
mitochondria prior to deposition of insoluble aggregates else-
where in the cell.
In functional mitochondria, the negatively charged phospho-
lipid cardiolipin (CL) localizes to the inner mitochondrial
membrane (IMM) but translocates to the OMM in response to
cellular stress, providing an anchor for LC3 and initiating
mitophagy24,25. Given the association of α-syn with fragmented
mitochondria (Fig. 2g), the early accumulation of monomeric α-
syn in mitochondrial fractions of A53T hNs (Fig. 4a–c) and
previous studies showing that α-syn interacts with cardiolipin at
the mitochondria14, we hypothesized that cardiolipin externaliza-
tion in response to the presence of α-syn may mark an early step
in the events leading to impaired mitochondrial dynamics in
A53T hNs.
We therefore sought to assess cardiolipin localization within
both SNCA-mutant cells and SNCA-transgenic animals. Cardio-
lipin is an anionic phospholipid whose externalization has been
shown
to
dramatically
lower
the
surface
charge
of
the
mitochondria26. To assess cardiolipin externalization, we first
used a probe for anionic charge (RPRE-RFP)26,27. Under
physiological conditions, the most abundant anionic charge in a
cell is phosphatidylserine at the inner surface of the plasma
membrane. Upon cardiolipin externalization, RPRE-RFP redis-
tributes from the plasma membrane to intracellular sites,
primarily mitochondria26,27. In order to assess whether the
mitochondria in our system were externalizing cardiolipin prior
to the onset of mitophagy, we first expressed mitoDSRed in DIV
14 corrected and A53T NPCs and assessed mitochondrial
structure (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). We found no difference in
the number of cells with fragmented mitochondria or in the total

 mitochondrial volume per cell between A53T cells and their
genetically corrected controls at this developmental stage. Next,
we expressed the RPRE-RFP charge probe in both A53T and
control NPCs at DIV 14 and assessed its subcellular localization.
While RPRE-RFP was predominantly localized to the plasma
membrane in genetically corrected cells, A53T cells showed a
marked
shift
in
subcellular
localization
of
RPRE-RFP
to
intracellular puncta (Supplementary Fig. 4d, e), indicating that
intracellular membranes in A53T hNs had begun to accumulate
negative charge.
We next sought to determine whether accumulation of
intracellular negative charge could be attributed to cardiolipin
exposure on the OMM. We visualized cardiolipin using a green
fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled cardiolipin probe (CL-GFP)
that contains the cardiolipin-binding domain of the mitochon-
drial protein SLP-2, in conjunction with RPRE-RFP to assess
anionic charge. We found a dramatic increase in colocalization of
the two probes in A53T cells relative to corrected cells (Fig. 4d, e),
consistent with the notion that the increase in negative charge at
the mitochondrial OMM in A53T cells is due to cardiolipin
externalization. We further characterized the proximity of RPRE
to cardiolipin by FRET in both hiPSC-derived A53T and
corrected cells as well as in hESC-derived WT, A53T and E46K
cells. We found a significant increase in the level of energy

 transfer between GFP-labeled cardiolipin and RFP-labeled RPRE
in SNCA-mutant hNs relative to their respective controls (Fig. 4f,
g), indicating that these molecules reside in very close proximity.
Finally, we sought to confirm this finding in vivo, using SNCA-
A53T mice expressing human A53T-mutant α-syn under the
Thy1 promoter12,28,29. We observed accumulation of heat-stable
α-syn in conjunction with α-syn-ubiquitylation in these animals
by the age of 6 months (Supplementary Fig. 4f). Mitochondria
were isolated from the SNpc of 6-month-old WT and A53T
transgenic animals and labeled with Annexin V, which is effective
in measuring cardiolipin translocation to the OMM in isolated
mitochondria25,30. We found that mitochondria from SNCA-
A53T transgenic animals show significantly more cardiolipin on
the mitochondrial surface than their WT littermates. Addition-
ally, we found that SNCA-A53T animals externalized cardiolipin
on the OMM to a similar extent to that of WT mitochondria that
had been exposed to rotenone (Fig. 4h).
Collectively, these data indicate that while the SNCA-mutation
is associated with mitochondrial stress in mature neurons both
in vitro and in vivo, this stress is initiated at earlier developmental
stages in response to α-syn present at mitochondrial membranes.
This association is coincident with a loss of mitochondrial surface
charge that results from cardiolipin exposure on the OMM and
precedes any increase in mitochondrial fragmentation. This
phenomenon may thus represent an early marker of pathology
that ultimately leads to excessive mitophagy due to prolonged
cardiolipin exposure in mature A53T hNs.
Cardiolipin binds α-syn and refolds α-syn oligomers. Given our
findings that cardiolipin exposure occurs well before any mito-
chondrial pathology, we sought to understand the purpose of
cardiolipin externalization in response to α-syn present on
mitochondrial membranes. We postulated that cardiolipin was
involved in regulating either (1) binding of mitochondrial
membranes to α-syn, (2) folding of disordered α-syn into an α-
helical state or (3) refolding of oligomeric/fibrillar α-syn aggre-
gates. In a cell-free system, we conducted a series of proof-of-
principle experiments in which we generated large unilamellar
lipid vesicles (LUVs) with increasing molar ratios of cardiolipin
that mimic the composition of the OMM (OMM vesicles). These
cardiolipin concentrations (8–30%) centered on the levels of
cardiolipin known to be externalized to the OMM of neurons
after exposure to the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rote-
none25. Using circular dichroic spectroscopy (CD), we first
assessed the ability of WT, A53T and E46K human recombinant
α-syn to bind cardiolipin-containing LUVs (Fig. 5a–e). Regres-
sion analysis of binding curves showed that WT and mutant α-
syn bind OMM LUVs in a cardiolipin-dependent manner, albeit
with differing specificities (Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, all
three α-syn forms had the same affinity for cardiolipin at a 30%
molar ratio, consistent with the level of cardiolipin reported to
recruit LC3 upon induction of mitochondrial stress25,30. We
simultaneously assessed the ability of LUVs containing increasing
molar ratios of cardiolipin to fold intrinsically disordered α-syn
monomers (Supplementary Fig. 5). We found a shift in the
spectra of both WT and mutant α-syn from disordered random
coil to α-helix with increasing cardiolipin ratios, indicating that
cardiolipin in the OMM can both bind to and promote folding of
disordered monomeric α-syn.
To address whether this mechanism occurs in the context of
pathology, we synthesized artificial, preformed fibrils (PFFs) from
α-syn monomers and conducted a similar experiment to
determine if cardiolipin externalization can facilitate refolding
of α-syn fibrils. We incubated WT, A53T or E46K preformed α-
syn fibrils with LUVs containing 30% cardiolipin by molar ratio
(Fig.
5f–h).
Time-dependent analysis
by CD spectroscopy
revealed that cardiolipin-containing LUVs are indeed able to
pull WT, A53T and E46K α-syn monomers away from fibrils and
refold the protein. These data were compared against the CD
spectra of monomeric protein established in Fig. 5e. Kinetic
analysis of the data at 222 nm (a wavelength informative of α-
helical formation) showed that the rate of refolding in the
presence of cardiolipin was higher for WT than for either A53T
or E46K α-syn (Fig. 5i), namely, 3.79 h−1 vs. 2.44 h−1 vs. 1.30 h−1
for
WT,
A53T
and
E46K
α-syn,
respectively.
Moreover,
deconvolution of the CD spectra at different time points showed
that

from

and
E46K
preformed fibrils was also significantly higher for WT α-syn
than for either A53T or E46K α-syn (Fig. 5j), plateauing by 24 h
of incubation. Collectively, these data show that α-syn binds
OMM vesicles in a cardiolipin-dependent manner and that
although cardiolipin-containing OMM vesicles promote refolding
of α-syn oligomers, cardiolipin must be externalized for a longer
period of time to refold A53T and E46K α-syn, because the
kinetic rate of refolding is slower than for WT. Since cardiolipin
at this molar ratio is also an anchor for LC3 and an initiating
signal for mitophagy24,25, we next sought to determine whether
LC3 binding to cardiolipin was influenced by the presence of α-
syn, and vice versa.
α-Syn and LC3 compete for binding to cardiolipin. Our final set
of binding experiments evaluated the impact of LC3 on the
binding of WT, A53T or E46K α-syn to OMM vesicles containing
Fig. 4 Cardiolipin is externalized to the mitochondrial surface in α-syn mutant hNs and transgenic mice in response to α-syn accumulation. a Western
analysis of lysates from corrected and A53T cells at DIV 14 and DIV 60 labeled for total α-syn, PS129, TH (DA neuronal marker), nestin (NPC marker) or
GAPDH show that levels of PS129-modified α-syn are elevated in A53T hNs at DIV 14 and remain elevated at DIV 60 relative to corrected cells. b, c
Mitochondria were purified from A53T cells and genetically corrected cells at both DIV 14 and DIV 60. Lysates were then separated based on TX-100
solubility (soluble) or urea solubility (insoluble). Western analysis of A53T cells shows elevated soluble α-syn at the mitochondria relative to corrected

Fig. 5 Cardiolipin promotes refolding of α-syn fibrils. a–d Binding of WT, A53T or E46K α-syn monomers to OMM-like LUVs, with increasing molar ratios
of CL, was measured by CD spectroscopy and the 222 nm signal was used to calculate the fraction of bound α-syn. Data are plotted as change in fraction of
bound protein vs. the total concentration of LUVs (bottom axis) or the total concentration of cardiolipin in the LUV (top axis). Binding parameters were
calculated by fitting the data to Eq. 1 (Methods) and are reported in Supplementary Table 1. e Representative CD spectra of the monomeric WT, A53T or

components (from primarily β-structures to primarily α-helical structures). The magenta line shows the CD spectra of the monomeric WT, A53T or E46K
α-syn in the presence of 1.2 mM LUVs as a reference standard. i Change in CD signal at 222 nm collected as a function of time. Kinetic data were fitted by

 30% cardiolipin. Equimolar ratios of recombinant human LC3
were incubated with either WT, A53T or E46K α-syn in the
presence of cardiolipin containing OMM vesicles and flotation
assays were performed to assess binding of each respective pro-
tein to OMM vesicles. We found that LC3 significantly inhibited
binding of WT α-syn to OMM vesicles (Fig. 5k) relative to WT α-
syn alone (Fig. 5k, pleated line), but that LC3-mediated inhibition
was significantly reduced in cases of A53T and E46K α-syn,
having no impact on E46K binding whatsoever. Moreover, we
found that WT α-syn similarly inhibited LC3 binding to OMM
vesicles relative to LC3 α-syn alone (Fig. 5l, pleated line), sug-
gesting that the two proteins are not normally present on OMMs
simultaneously. The inhibition of LC3 binding to OMM vesicles
was also significantly reduced in the cases of A53T and E46K α-
syn. These data suggest that WT α-syn can interact with cardi-
olipin at the mitochondria without triggering LC3-dependent
clearance of mitochondria, as WT α-syn inhibits LC3 binding to
OMM vesicles. Mutant α-syn variants, however, do not share this
inhibitory effect on LC3 binding and in fact co-exist on
cardiolipin-rich OMMs. This finding would explain, at least in
part, why SNCA-mutant hNs manifest increased mitochondrial
clearance relative to control hNs.
SNCA-mutant hNs transmit mitochondrial pathology. Several
recent studies have shown that aberrantly folded α-syn can
transmit to and seed synucleinopathy in healthy cells, propagat-
ing the pathology31–33. These reports support a prion-like
hypothesis of PD pathogenesis. Indeed, pathological analysis of
graft tissue from a human PD subject who received a transplant
of embryonic mesencephalon revealed Lewy body-like pathology
in the grafted tissue 14 years after transplant34.
In order to assess whether misfolded α-syn, and consequently
mitochondrial dysfunction, could be propagated from A53T to
corrected cells, we developed a co-culture system in which
isogenic-corrected cells expressing GFP were co-cultured with
A53T cells at DIV 14 and differentiated together. Differentiation
in co-culture had no impact on the proportion of TH+ve neurons
generated (Supplementary Fig. 6a–b). We labeled co-cultured
GFP+ve-corrected and GFP−ve-A53T hNs for α-syn PS129 and
ubiquitin to assess early signs of synucleinopathy. We noted
accumulation of both of these pathological markers in GFP+ve
and GFP−ve hNs (Fig. 6a) and quantification of α-syn PS129+ve
cells showed similar elevated levels in both GFP+ve and GFP−ve
populations (Fig. 6b).
To assess the impact of co-culture on mitophagic clearance, we
next combined isogenic-corrected cells expressing GFP and
MitoDSRed with A53T-mutant cells expressing MitoDSRed alone
and differentiated them in co-culture. Upon terminal differentia-
tion of co-cultured cells, we antigenically labeled cells with the
autophagy marker LC3 and assessed formation of mitochondria-
localized LC3 puncta in both GFP+ve and GFP−ve neurites
(Fig. 6c). As noted above, A53T hNs had significantly higher
numbers of cells containing fragmented mitochondria (Fig. 2)
and a greater number of LC3+ve puncta (Fig. 3). In contrast,
analysis of the co-cultured neurons showed that GFP+ve-
corrected hNs accumulated LC3+ve puncta to the same extent
as GFP−ve mutant hNs, and that these puncta were localized to
mitochondria (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, both the GFP−ve mutant
hN and the GFP+ve-corrected hN cultures contained similar
proportions of cells with fragmented mitochondria (Fig. 6d). We
also
confirmed
that
these
events
translated
into
loss
of
mitochondrial potential in co-cultured GFP+ve and GFP−ve
hNs by flow cytometry of TMRE-labeled cells. In contrast to
our previous experiments (Fig. 3e), which showed that corrected
hNs
maintained
normal
mitochondrial
potential
when
differentiated alone, co-culture with A53T hNs resulted in
depolarization of mitochondria in GFP+ve-corrected hNs (red
trace) as indicated by a shift in TMRE fluorescence to levels
resembling the GFP−ve-A53T population (black trace) (Fig. 6e
and Supplementary Fig 6c). GFP+ve-corrected hNs co-cultured
with untransformed (GFP−ve) corrected hNs showed no evidence
of α-syn PS129 accumulation and no LC3 punta formation
(Supplementary Fig. 6d, e).
We next assessed whether these effects could be attributed to
cardiolipin translocation to the OMM and associated accumula-
tion of anionic charge on the surface of mitochondria in corrected
cells. We expressed both CL-GFP and RPRE-GFP in corrected
cells (only) and differentiated them alone or in the presence of
A53T cells. Whereas corrected cells cultured alone exhibited a
plasma membrane localization of RPRE-RFP that is distinct from
the CL-GFP expression pattern, co-culture with A53T cells
caused redistribution of RPRE-RFP and resulted in colocalization
of this negative charge probe with CL-GFP (Fig. 6f). This result
indicates that corrected hNs undergo a change in mitochondrial
surface charge corresponding to externalization of cardiolipin in
the setting of co-culture with A53T hNs. We further characterized
the proximity of RPRE to cardiolipin by FRET in either hiPSC-
derived Corrected hNs, differentiated in co-culture with isogenic
A53T hNs, or in WT hNs, differentiated in co-culture with
isogenic A53T or E46K hNs. We found that co-culture with
SNCA-mutant neurons resulted in a significant increase in the
level of energy transfer between GFP-labeled cardiolipin and
RFP-labeled RPRE in both corrected and WT hNs relative to
when these lines are cultured alone (Fig. 6g, h), indicating that co-
culture with SNCA-mutant neurons alters cardiolipin localization
within mitochondrial membranes of neighboring, non-mutant
neurons. These data further suggest that co-culture of healthy
neurons with SNCA-mutant neurons can (1) trigger the onset of
synucleinopathy, (2) initiate cardiolipin externalization to the
OMM and (3) promote LC3-dependent mitochondrial clearance.
Collectively, these results suggest that molecular markers of PD
pathology can be transmitted from mutant to healthy human cells
in our system.
Antibodies against α-syn prevent transmission of pathology.
Next, we sought to simultaneously test whether secreted α-syn
was indeed responsible for the transmission of mitochondrial
pathology from A53T to corrected hNs as well as whether a
specific α-syn mAb could prevent the spread of disease by
blocking α-syn transmission and rescuing mitochondrial pathol-
ogy. For these experiments, we co-cultured hiPSC-derived, GFP-
labeled isogenic-corrected and unlabeled A53T α-syn cells from
DIV 14 to DIV 60 in the presence of either 1 μg ml−1 α-syn mAb
(anti-α-syn) or 1 μg ml−1 of a non-specific IgG. An identical
experimental paradigm was established in hESC-derived hNs by
co-culturing GFP-labeled WT cells with isogenic A53T or E46K
SNCA-mutant cells. The efficiency of α-syn capture from media is
reported in Supplementary Table 2. We then labeled the co-
cultures at DIV 60 for α-syn PS129. Importantly, the presence of
anti-α-syn mAb compared to IgG significantly reduced the per-
centage of α-syn PS129+ve/GFP+ve-corrected hNs relative to total
GFP+ve-corrected hNs (Fig. 7a, b and Supplementary Fig. 7a, b).
In contrast, the presence of anti-α-syn mAb compared to IgG had
no effect on the proportion of α-syn PS129+ve/GFP−ve-SNCA-
mutant hNs. This result is consistent with the notion that α-syn-
mAb present in the media captures secreted α-syn to inhibit the
spread of pathology from the SNCA-mutant cells to the isogenic
control cells within the co-culture system.
Finally, we examined the impact of blocking α-syn transmis-
sion on the propagation of mitochondrial dysfunction in co-

treatment with anti-α-syn (Fig. 7c–f). These results support a
critical role for secreted α-syn in the transmission of mitochon-
drial pathology in human PD neurons and suggest that α-syn
mAbs may effectively block both proteostatic and mitochondrial
stress-induced cellular phenotypes in PD.

 Discussion
Although mitochondrial function is known to be aberrant in PD,
the link between this dysfunction and the deposition of toxic
protein aggregates has remained unclear. In this study, we
describe a novel mechanism in which cardiolipin plays a vital role
in α-syn folding. Furthermore, we show that OMM-localized
cardiolipin can pull α-syn monomers out from preformed fibrils,
facilitating their refolding, thus effectively buffering synucleino-
pathy. This buffering capacity is reduced by mutations in α-syn
that cause familial PD. Finally, we show that mitochondrial
pathology can spread from human α-syn mutant cells to non-
mutant cells by direct transmission of mutant α-syn. Importantly,
this spread can be blocked by an anti-α-syn mAb.
In animal models of both familial and sporadic neurodegen-
erative conditions, including PD, morphologically abnormal
mitochondria appear in the brain as a result of altered fission/
fusion dynamics35–37, with α-syn reportedly driving mitochon-
drial fission14 and inhibiting fusion38. Although α-syn has been
reported to interact with several types of intracellular mem-
branes39, it appears to have a preferential affinity for mitochon-
drial or mitochondria-associated membranes15,40. The initial
attraction of α-syn to these membranes seems to require anionic
charge, as in vitro quenching of the cardiolipin phosphate group
in artificial mitochondrial membranes directly inhibits the
interaction between α-syn and the mitochondrial membrane41.
The physical interaction of WT α-syn with cardiolipin has been
reported to involve the N-terminal region of WT α-syn and the
cardiolipin acyl side chains42. The acyl chains induce negative
curvature strain in cardiolipin microdomains which, coupled to
the divalent anionic charge from the diphosphatidyl glycerol
headgroup, has been proposed to facilitate docking of α-syn oli-
gomers43,44. The LC3 binding to cardiolipin has also been
reported to be dependent on the presence of the acyl side chains,
as LC3 binding to lyso-cardiolipin is dramatically reduced25. Our
data suggest that WT α-syn and LC3 compete for binding to the
same site on cardiolipin, identifying a possible mechanism by
which α-syn may regulate LC3-induced mitophagy. A53T and
E46K α-syn had a significantly reduced ability to competitively
inhibit LC3 binding to cardiolipin, which may explain the
increase in mitophagic flux observed in SNCA-mutant neurons.
It has been proposed that anionic phospholipids, such as car-
diolipin, can promote folding of disordered α-syn monomers to
an α-helical structure14,45. In support of this hypothesis, we are
the first to show that cardiolipin has the capacity to buffer
synucleinopathy by drawing α-syn monomers out of potentially
pathological oligomers and fibrils, a capacity that is reduced in
fibrils composed of mutant α-syn. This observation is in contrast
to reports that anionic membranes promote α-syn aggregation46–
48; however, these early studies did not focus on cardiolipin-
containing mitochondrial membranes, but rather on synapto-
somes and phosphatidic acid-containing LUVs, suggesting that
the observed effects on refolding of α-syn fibrils may be unique to
cardiolipin-containing
mitochondrial
and
mitochondria-
associated membranes. Our findings therefore establish a novel
role for mitochondria in the proper folding and refolding of α-syn
and further suggest that mitochondria may be an important
defense mechanism against abnormal α-syn deposition and Lewy
body formation.
Based upon our results, it is tempting to speculate that the
early-onset PD phenotype associated with the A53T or E46K
mutations may be related, at least in part, to the reduced capacity
of the mitochondria to refold mutant α-syn. The increased
abundance and duration of cardiolipin exposure on the OMM
needed to refold mutant α-syn would alter membrane dynamics
and may initiate the depolarization of mitochondrial membranes
and associated mitochondrial stress that we observe in SNCA-
mutant neurons. Recent reports that oxidatively modified α-syn
interacts
with
Tom20
and
impairs
mitochondrial
protein
import49 may lend insight into the mechanism by which α-syn
association with the mitochondria facilitates cardiolipin exposure.
It is possible that oligomeric α-syn can similarly impair mito-
chondrial protein import and that this signals translocation of
cardiolipin from the IMM to the OMM to alleviate this inhibition.
Multiple lines of evidence have shown that oligomeric α-syn
aggregates can seed pathology in previously healthy cells by
promoting oligomeric aggregation32,50,51. Striatal injections of
WT α-syn PFFs in healthy mice result in the accumulation of
hyperphosphorylated α-syn deposits in other brain regions with a
direct connection to the striatum within 30 days, suggesting that
cell-to-cell transmission occurs in rodents and that it follows
inter-neuronal connectivity32. Our data are, to our knowledge,
the first to show that endogenous mutant α-syn can transmit cell
to cell in a hPSC-derived neuronal system, triggering mitochon-
drial pathology in healthy cells. Moreover, these effects manifest
within months, which supports the similarly short timeframe for
transmission observed in mice32. In addition, our findings high-
light and support the importance of recent advances in α-syn
immunotherapy, in which mAbs against misfolded α-syn reduced
the formation of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in mice injected
with preformed fibrils50. Our results show that an α-syn antibody

 transfer of α-syn pathology between cells, suggesting that the C-
terminal epitope of α-syn remains available. However, this would
not rule out concurrent exosome-mediated transfer of α-syn, and
may even include α-syn transferred via exosomes as the nature of
the interaction between exosomal vesicles and α-syn is not well
characterized. This membrane interaction may involve the α-syn
N terminus (as described for mitochondrial membranes), which
may still permit C-terminal capture via mAbs if exposed on the
membrane surface. Moreover, we also detect α-syn in association
with lysosomes, and therefore cannot rule out the simultaneous
transfer of α-syn through multiple mechanisms. Nonetheless, the
data presented here and the work of others suggest that α-syn
immunotherapy is a promising avenue that warrants further
exploration and that therapeutic approaches that block α-syn
transmission may have a role as an adjunctive therapy.
Methods
hiPSC/hESC culture. With the exception of the WT BGO1 hESCs, the cell lines
used in this study were generated and kindly shared by Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch16.
BGO1 hESCs were derived by BresaGen Inc. Genotypes of WT/Corrected and
A53T cell lines were confirmed by restriction digest of genomic DNA, as previously
described16. hPSCs (hiPSCs/hESCs designated as PSCs hereafter) were routinely
cultured and maintained in our laboratory using a protocol described previously12
with slight modifications. Briefly, pluripotent cells were plated on γ-irradiated
human foreskin fibroblasts and cultured using ESC medium containing 20%
knockout serum replacement (KSR) and 8 ng ml−1 basic fibroblast growth factor
(FGF), changed daily. The colonies were manually passaged weekly.
A9 DA neuronal differentiation. Differentiation of PSCs into A9-type DA neu-
rons was performed as described previously12,17. Immediately preceding differ-
entiation, the colonies were dissociated into a single cell suspension using accutase.
To purify PSCs and remove fibroblast feeders, medium containing dissociated
fibroblasts and PSCs was placed in gelatin-coated dishes. After adherence of the
dissociated fibroblasts, supernatant containing purified PSCs was collected and re-
plated at 4 × 104 cells per cm2 on Matrigel (BD)-coated tissue culture dishes for
differentiation. Floor-plate induction was carried out using medium containing
KSR, LDN193189 (100 nM), SB431542 (10 μM), Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) C25II
(100 ng ml−1, Purmorphamine (2 μM), FGF8 (100 ng ml−1 and CHIR99021 (3
μM). On day 5 of differentiation, KSR medium was incrementally shifted to N2
medium (25%, 50%, 75%) every 2 days. On day 11, the medium was changed to
Neurobasal/B27/Glutamax supplemented with CHIR. On day 13, CHIR was
replaced with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 20 ng ml−1), ascorbic acid
(0.2 mM), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; 20 ng ml−1), transforming
growth factor-β3 (TGFβ3; 1 ng ml−1), dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP; 0.5 mM) and
DAPT (10 μM) for 9 days. On day 20, cells were dissociated using accutase and re-
plated under high cell density 4 × 105 cells per cm2 in terminal differentiation
medium (NB/B27+BDNF, ascorbic acid, GDNF, dbcAMP, TGFβ3 and DAPT) or
DAN Medium (DA Neuron) on dishes pre-coated with poly-ornithine (15 μg ml−1)/
laminin (1 μg ml−1)/fibronectin (2 μg ml−1). Nucleofection with mt-mKeima
(addgene), RPRE-RFP or RPRE-GFP (Dr. Sergio Grinstein, Hospital for Sick Chil-
dren, Toronto) and CL-GFP (Dr. Joaquin Madrenas, McGill University, Montreal),
was performed between days 11 and 14 (hNPC) or days 20–25 of terminal differ-
entiation using human stem cell nucleofector kit 1 (Lonza, VPH5012) in conjunction
with the Amaxa Nucleofector 2b system (Lonza) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Stable MitoDSRed and or GFP expression was achieved by lentiviral
infection at DIV 11 of differentiation. For mAB treatments, cells were treated with a
mouse monoclonal IgG1 targeted against the C terminus of α-syn or an isotype-
specific control mAB (Santa Cruz). Knockdown of autophagy genes was achieved by
lentiviral expression of shRNA IRES GFP constructs targeted against Becn1 gene
product or scrambled controls using the following sequences: Becn1: GGAGG-
CAGTGGCGGCTCCTATTCCATCAA or CACCATGCAGGTG
AGCTTCGTGTGCCAGC.
Animals. B6.Cg-Tg(THY1-SNCA*A53T)M53Sud/J mice (The Jackson Laboratory)
and wild-type controls were housed in compliance with ethical regulations and
experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Scintillon
Institute for Biomedical and Bioenergy Research. Male and female animals between
6 and 8 months of age were used.
Immunocytochemistry and fluorescence analysis. Cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min, washed 1× with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS
for 30 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody overnight, and the
appropriate AlexaFluor (488, 555, 647)-conjugated secondary antibodies were used
at 1:2000. Primary antibodies and dilutions were as follows. Tom20 and Tom40
(1:500) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Cat. no. sc-17764 and sc-
11414); GIRK2 (1:1000) was obtained from Millipore (Cat. no. AB5200). Phos-
phoserine 129 (81A) (1:1000) LC3 (1:500), beta-III-Tubulin and Ubiquitin (1:500)
were purchased from BioLegend (Cat. no. 825701, 827101, 801202, 840501), while
total α-synuclein (1:500) was from BD Biosciences (Cat. no. 610787). Anti-TH
(1:1000) was from Pelfreeze (Cat. no. P40101) while anti-vGlut (1:500) and anti-
GAD65 (1:500) were from Synaptic Systems (Cat. no. 135302, 198111). Cells were
counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:500) from Invitrogen. For
FRET analysis cells were labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophores alone to
establish bleed-through constants prior to co-labeling and analysis. Analysis was
performed using the FRET analysis tool of Volocity 6.3 (PerkinElmer). For analysis
of percent PS129-positive neurons containing fragmented, mitoDSRed-expressing
hNs were fixed, stained for PS129 and imaged using Axio-observer LSM 800 with
Airyscan or using light-emitting diode (LED)-based illumination and Optical
Sectioning by structured illumination (Zeiss), and morphological analysis of
PS129-positive and MitoDSR-positive particles was performed using the mea-
surements tool of Volocity 6.3 (PerkinElmer). PS129-positive neurons were
determined by establishing a threshold of staining intensity in Volocity’s Advanced
Measurements Tools. Mitochondria within cells that were positive for
PS129 staining were scored as fragmented if >15% of the total mitochondrial
volume per cell existed in particles with a volume <5 μm3. Proximity ligation assay
was performed using the DuoLink in situ Red detection platform with mouse and
rabbit probes. Imaging was performed using either an Axio-observer LSM 800 with
Airyscan for super-resolution imaging by structured illumination (Zeiss) or an
Axio-observer Live-cell imaging microscope with LED-based illumination and
Optical Sectioning by structured illumination (Zeiss). Objectives used were Plan-
APO 40×/1.4 Oil DIC (UV) VIS-IR or Plan-APO 63×/1.4 Oil DIC M27.
Mitochondrial structure and function. For fragmentation analysis, MitoDSRed
expressing hNs were imaged using Axio-observer LSM 800 with Airyscan or using
LED-based illumination and Optical Sectioning by structured illumination (Zeiss),
and volumetric analysis of mitochondrial particles was performed using the
measurements tool of Volocity 6.3 (PerkinElmer). Mitochondria were scored as
fragmented if >15% of the total mitochondrial volume per cell existed in particles
with a volume <5 μm3. Mitochondrial potential was assessed by analyzing TMRE
fluorescence levels using the dequench method and based on the manufacturer's
protocol on a Beckman-Coulter FC500 flow cytometer. For TEM, neurons were
fixed with 4% PFA/2% Gluteraldehyde, counterstained with 1% osmium and 1%
uranyl acetate in cacodylate buffer, embedded in LR White, sectioned and imaged
on a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 Transmission Electron Microscope.
Mitochondrial fractionation and protein analysis. Isolation of intact mito-
chondria from cultured cells was completed using the Mito Isolation Kit (Thermo).
Cytosolic soluble proteins were extracted using the mitochondrial isolation reagent
C (CHAPS-based lysis buffer) that was a component of the kit. Isolated

 mitochondria were lysed using Tris-buffered saline (TBS)+1% Triton X-100.
Samples were sonicated using a 2 mm probe tip sonicator (5 s pulse, 40% amp, 30 s
total time) and spun at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed
and labeled “soluble fraction”. Pellets were washed twice in corresponding lysis

at room temperature for 30 min and then stored at −20 oC until needed. Protease

buffers just before use. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad

anti-mouse (Thermo, 1:2000) and anti-rabbit (Thermo, 1:2000) horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used in a 1:2000 dilution. Clarity
Western ECL Blotting Substrate (Bio-Rad) was used to visualize bands on blots.
Anti-mouse (800) and anti-rabbit (700) Li-Cor infrared conjugated secondary
antibodies were used at 1:1000. Bands were visualized on the Li-Cor Fc imaging
platform. Uncropped blots can be found in Supplementary Fig. 8.
Protein purification and α-synuclein PFF formation. The plasmid pET21a con-
taining human α-synuclein complementary DNA was purchased through Addgene
(Plasmid 51486) and deposited by MJFF. Mutagenesis was subsequently performed
to generate the A53T variant using the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (NEB) with
the following mutagenesis primers: for A53T forward: GCATGGTGTGaCAA-
CAGTGGC, reverse: ACCACTCCCTCCTTGGTT; for E46K forward: CAAAAC-
CAAAAAAGGCGTGGT, reverse: CTGCCGACATACAGAACAC. Mutant and
non-mutant colonies from a freshly transformed BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL
competent cells (Life Technologies) were used to inoculate a 10 ml starter culture,
which was grown overnight at 37 C in an incubator shaker. Cell culture from the
overnight growth was then diluted 100-fold and induced with 250 μg ml−1 IPTG at
A600 = 0.6 for 3 h. All the cultures were performed in LB media with 50 μg ml−1
ampicillin at 37 oC. Cultures were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and
pellets were frozen at −80 °C until they were ready to be used. Protein purification
was completed via boiling according to ref. 55 with slight modifications made to
adjust for the anionic properties of α-synuclein. Briefly, the cell pellet from 500 ml
culture was thawed on ice for 20 min, resuspended in 50 ml water, placed in a
beaker of boiling water for 20 min with shaking every 5 min and then placed on ice
for another 5 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C.
Supernatant was transferred to a new tube, Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was added to a final
concentration of 20 mM and supernatant was run through a 0.2 μm filter. Anion-
exchange chromatography (FPLC) was performed on a 1 ml Pall AcroSep column
connected to a DuoLogic system (Bio-Rad). Fractions were analyzed using
SDS–PAGE, and those fractions containing α-synuclein were pooled and run
through a Symmetry 300, C18, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (HPLC) column on a Waters system with Millennium 32 software. After
reversed-phase HPLC, the pure protein solution was frozen at -80 °C and lyo-
philized until dry. Samples were stored at -20 °C until further use. The A53T and
E46K sequences were validated via mass spectrometry. Preparation of PFFs was
completed as per ref. 56 with minor changes. The starting 30 mg ml−1 monomeric
stock solution was made fresh from lyophilized protein powder and not a frozen
stock solution. The stock solution was then spun at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min,
and the supernatant was removed to produce PFFs. The supernatant was diluted in
sterile PBS to a final volume of 500 μl and a final concentration of 5 mg ml−1.
Samples were put on a Vibromixer placed inside a 37 °C warm room and shaken
for 7 days at 1000 rpm. A sedimentation assay was completed to confirm PFF
formation, and PFFs were aliquoted (10 μl) and stored at −80 oC until needed. The
plasmid (pET15b) containing human LC3B was purchased through Addgene
(plasmid 73949) and deposited by Dr. Dieter Willbold’s lab. The plasmid was
transformed and expression induced in the same manner as α-synuclein. LC3B was
purified as per the Willbold lab protocol57.
LUV preparation. All lipids (porcine brain phosphatidylcholine (PC), porcine
brain phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), bovine liver phosphatidylinositol (PI),
porcine brain phosphatidylserine (PS) and cardiolipin (CL)) were purchased from
Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and stored at −20 °C until use. Aliquots of
chloroform solutions of PI, PC, PS, PE and CL were combined in the following six
molar ratios: (1) 9.4:55.2:7.3:28.1:0; (2) 8.8:51.9:6.9:26.4:6; (3) 8.6:50.8:6.7:25.9:8; (4)
8.3:48.6:6.4:24.7:12; (5) 7.8:45.8:6.1:23.3:17; and (6) 6.6:38.6:5.1:19.7:30. Large
unilamellar vesicles with a 100 nm diameter, referred to as LUVs, were formed as
previously described58.
CD spectroscopy. All CD data were collected using a Jasco J-815 spectro-
polarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic, Tokyo, Japan) using a quartz cuvette with a 1
mm path length (Hellma, Concord, ON, Canada), with thermostatting at 37 °C
using a Jasco PTC-424S/15 Peltier temperature controller (Japan Spectroscopic,
Tokyo, Japan). The samples contained 4 μM of protein (WT, A53T or E46K α-
synuclein) in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and various con-
centrations of LUVs. Each spectrum was collected at a scan rate of 100 nm min−1
and represents an average of 3 scans. Corresponding buffer scans were subtracted
from sample scans before analysis and presentation of the data. Secondary struc-
ture was analyzed using the CONTIN-LL algorithm59 at Dichroweb60. Experiments
were typically repeated two or more times with independently prepared samples.
For kinetic and binding experiments, each CD value at 222 nm was acquired for 45
s with 1 s intervals and all data points were averaged.
Analysis of cardiolipin binding. In the binding experiments, the observed CD
signal at 222 nm consists of a signal from two populations of protein molecules,
bound and free, and therefore the fraction of bound protein can be expressed as
(CDobs−CDf)/(CDb–CDf) and fitted to the following equation using OriginPro 8
(Origin Lab Corporation, Northampton, MA):

where CDobs is the signal acquired at 222 nm after buffer subtraction; CDf is signal
acquired at 222 nm in the absence of LUVs (signal of free protein); CDb is the
signal acquired at 222 nm in the presence of saturating concentration of LUVs
(signal of bound protein); [α-syn]t is the total concentration of α-syn in the mixture
(4 μM); [LUV]t is the total concentration of LUVs added to the reaction mixture; n
is the stoichiometry of binding (number of lipid molecules per molecule of pro-
tein); and KD is the dissociation constant.
Impact of LC3 on cardiolipin binding. Flotation assay experiments were based on
a protocol described by Anton et al.61. Each experiment contained 10 µM of protein
(LC3B alone, WT α-syn alone, A53T α-syn alone, E46K α-syn alone or LC3B and
WT, A53T or E46K α-syn) and 0.5 mM LUVs in 125 µl potassium phosphate
buffer (KPB). Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, after which they were
mixed with 175 µl of 2.4 M sucrose. Using a syringe, 400 µl of 0.8 M sucrose and
300 µl of 0.5 M sucrose were carefully layered in each tube. Samples were cen-
trifuged at 90,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C using a MLA-130 rotor (Beckmann). Fol-
lowing centrifugations, fractions were collected using a syringe, starting with the
bottom 250 µl, containing free protein. The remaining 750 µl was collected as
apparently bound protein. Free protein was quantified by western blot for LC3B
and slot blot for α-synuclein. For LC3B, samples were separated on a Tricine
SDS–PAGE gel and transferred onto a 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membrane and probed
with rabbit anti-LC3B (Abcam; 1:1000). For slot blots, fractions were applied to a
0.2 µm nitrocellulose membrane via slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and probed with
mouse anti-α-synuclein (BD; 1:1000). Donkey anti-rabbit-800 and donkey
anti-mouse-700 Licor secondary antibodies were used in a 1:10,000 dilution.
Membranes were imaged on a Licor-Fc and quantified using Image studio suite
version 5.2 (Licor). Quantitative densitometry was normalized to free protein
standards.
Statistical analysis. Data represent at least three independent experiments, pre-
sented as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical significance was ascertained by Student's t-test or
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with appropriate post hoc testing; p < 0.05
was considered significant. All data were analyzed using Prism7 (Graphpad Soft-
ware Inc.). For data not fitting a normal distribution, non-parametric tests were
used.
Data availability. All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in
this published article (and its Supplementary Information files) or is available from
