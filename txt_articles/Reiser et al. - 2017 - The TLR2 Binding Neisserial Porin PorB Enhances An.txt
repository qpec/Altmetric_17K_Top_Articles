TOLL-like receptor (TLR) ligands activate both innate and adaptive immune cells, while modulating the 
cellular immune response. The outer membrane protein (OMP) from Neisseria meninigitidis, PorB, is a 
naturally occurring TLR2 ligand and functions as an adjuvant. Here, we demonstrate that PorB increases 
the level of OVA in the endo-/lysosomal cellular compartment of BMDCs, increases antigen presenting 
cell (APC) trafficking to draining lymph nodes, and enhances antigen cross-presentation. PorB is capable 
of mounting an antigen specific T cell response by efficiently stimulating antigen cross-presentation in 
vivo and in vitro assessed by BMDC OT-I cocultivation assays. The enhanced antigen cross-presentation 
and the increased APC recruitment to secondary lymphoid tissues expand the scope of known adjuvant 
effects of PorB on the immune system. Our findings lead to a better understanding of how TLR-ligand 
based adjuvants can alter and modulate immune responses.
Vaccines are one of the most important achievements in modern medicine within the 20th century. The devel-
opment of new vaccines against infectious diseases (e.g. Tuberculosis, Measles, HIV, or Ebola viruses etc.) will 
require a detailed mechanistic understanding of the pathogen and host interactions, including entry, pathogen-
esis, and early events during the innate immune response, ultimately leading to a protective adaptive immune 
response. An essential component of an effective vaccine is its formulation with an adjuvant. Live attenuated 
or inactivated whole pathogen vaccine preparations have inherent adjuvants, e.g. TOLL-like receptor (TLR) 
agonists, or viral nucleic acids, inducing a directed immune response. To date, adjuvants are co-administered 
with poorly immunogenic antigens, shaping immune responses. They act simultaneously as delivery systems, 
enhancers and immunomodulators. The mechanism of action for each adjuvant is very specific. Aluminum salts 
(Alum) for example have a well-established safety profile and have been used in millions of vaccine doses until 
now. Their exact mode of action, however, is still under investigation1, 2. Alum activates antigen-presenting cells 
(APCs), increases antigen uptake and recruits APCs to site of injection3, 4. Novel vaccination strategies include 
the combination and integration of TLR agonists as adjuvants or other new formulation approaches and are 
currently in the focus of research for more effective vaccine design5–7. Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns 
(PAMPs), like TLR ligands, have been extensively studied as vaccine adjuvants8–11. They are known to function 
through a variety of pathways, including direct stimulation of APCs12, 13, increased antigen uptake and antigen 
processing14, as well as the release of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines upon APC maturation15. Antigen 
presenting cells play a major role in the onset of protective immunity. In addition to antigen uptake, the antigen 
needs to be proteolytically degraded, loaded onto either MHC class II or class I for CD4 or CD8 T cell stimulation, 
respectively, and costimulatory receptors on the APC have to be engaged to trigger activation and proliferation 
of T cells upon APC arrival in the draining lymph node. Dendritic cells (DCs), as professional APCs, are capable 
of stimulating both B cells and T cells in context of major histocompatibility complexes. Targeting antigen to 
DCs and the induction of cytokines aiding in the onset of a protective immune response are key features for an 
efficient vaccine6, 10, 16. Different DC subsets and other cell associated or soluble mediators determine the type of 
immune response, i.e. Th1 or Th2. CD8α
− DCs utilize MHC II for exogenously derived antigen and present it to

CD4 T cells, whereas CD8α

also called cross-presentation17–19.
Our laboratory utilizes the TLR2 stimulating capacity of PorB, a trimeric outer membrane protein derived 
from Neisseria meningitidis13, 20 to characterize the underlying molecular adjuvant mechanisms. Many investiga-
tors, including us, have shown, that PorB acts as a potent adjuvant and induces a robust immune response, when 
co-administered with poorly immunogenic antigens, e.g. peptides21 or ovalbumin22. In addition, PorB has been 
shown to be able to induce a T cell-dependent response to normally T cell-independent antigens, like bacterial 
capsular polysaccharides (CPS)23–26. Our group has shown that PorB enhances the humoral immune response to 
the meningococcal CPS, which is dependent on increased expression of CD86 on APCs27. We also have demon-
strated that PorB enhances immune responses to Francisella tularensis LPS, and increases protection in a mouse 
model of pulmonary tularemia28. PorB is a ligand of TLR1/TLR2 heterodimers and acts as a MyD88-dependent 
PAMP22. PorB has been used in humans as an immune adjuvant23–26. Yet, the complete underlying molecular 
mechanisms, how PorB’s adjuvant effect aids in the generation of protective immune responses, are not fully 
understood.
In the present study we investigated how PorB modulates antigen localization within professional APCs using 
in vitro matured bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) stimulated with fluorescently labeled ovalbumin 
(OVA). PorB formulation enhanced the shuttling of incorporated antigen in the endo-/lysosomal compartment 
relevant for cross-presentation. In vivo, PorB facilitated immune cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes and 
induced an OVA-specific CD8 T cell response in wild type (wt) mice. The cross-presentation of soluble OVA, in 
vitro, is significantly enhanced compared to unformulated antigen. Our findings support the potential of PorB 
being used as a TLR based adjuvant in vaccine formulations.
Results
PorB increases antigen presenting cell activation and shuttling of antigen into the endo-/lyso-
somal compartment. 
TLR ligands inherent in pathogens are known to increase antigen uptake and process-
ing14, 29. We hypothesized that PorB, as a TLR2 based adjuvant, might enhance antigen uptake and simultaneously 
increases cytokine production to establish an inflammatory environment promoting innate and adaptive immune 
responses. Therefore, we investigated the influence of PorB and other TLR based adjuvants on antigen uptake by 
incubating wt derived BMDCs with Alexa Fluor-594 labeled ovalbumin (OVA-A594) formulated with different 
TLR agonists. Antigen uptake was analyzed by flow cytometry and interpreted as mean fluorescence intensity 
(MFI) of OVA-A594 associated with CD11c+ CD11b+ BMDCs (Supplementary Fig. S1a for gating strategy). 
Formulation with PorB (grey triangle) and Pam3CSK4 (black triangle, a synthesized TLR2 ligand) resulted in 
slightly higher MFI values, although not significant when compared to OVA-A594 alone (Fig. 1a). Formulation 
with CpG, a TLR9 ligand, or LPS, a TLR4 ligand, did not increase OVA-A594 uptake. We found no difference in 
antigen uptake in TLR2−
/− BMDCs (Supplementary Fig. S1b) comparing OVA-A594 + PorB with OVA-A594 
only treated BMDCs. We showed previously that PorB induces inflammatory cytokines in APCs after extended 
exposure13, 22. PorB and Pam3CSK4 formulation of OVA-A594 enhanced the induction of TNFα
 and IL-6 signifi-
cantly compared to OVA-A594 only treated BMDCs as early as 4 h for TNFα
 and 8 h for IL-6 following PorB stim-
ulation (Fig. 1b,c, Supplementary Table 1 for statistics). CpG and LPS formulation also triggered high levels of 
TNFα
 and IL-6 and showed no enhanced antigen uptake. Noteworthy, PorB did not induce the type I interferon, 
interferon β
 (IFNβ
), which implies that PorB does not induce signaling via IRF3 or IRF7. LPS and CpG trig-
gered detectable amounts of IFNβ
, which were significantly higher than OVA-A594 only treated BMDCs starting 
at 4 h for LPS and 6 h for CpG (Fig. 1d). The induced inflammatory cytokine environment triggered by PorB, 
led us to hypothesize that PorB formulation might rather influence antigen transfer into specific cellular com-
partments involved in antigen processing and presentation, than enhancing uptake for OVA as model antigen. 
Although exogenous antigen is usually processed and presented via the MHC class II pathway, it can also enter 
the MHC class I pathway, also known as cross-presentation17–19. This pathway requires antigen translocation and 
proteasomal degradation30–32. We therefore stimulated adherent BMDCs on glass cover slips with fluorescently 
labeled OVA-A594 for 30 minutes or 2 h respectively. Antigen localization was determined by antibody staining 
for early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1 - Cyan) and lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1 - Green) 
using immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). PBS treated BMDCs showed no unspecific signal for OVA-A594 
(Fig. 2a). PorB formulation significantly enhanced OVA-A594 colocalization within endosomes and lysosomes 
respectively (Figs 2c and 3a) within 30 minutes compared to OVA-A594 only treatment (Fig. 2b). Prolonged 
stimulation (2 h) of BMDCs with OVA-A594 with or without PorB formulation revealed increased intracellular 
OVA-A594 occurrence in both cellular compartments without a significant difference (Figs 2d,e and 3b). Over 
the course of the stimulation (0.5 h versus 2 h) the fluorescence of OVA-A594 remained clearly traceable within 
the endo-/lysosomal compartment and is accelerated through the prescence of PorB as early as 0.5 h. The formu-
lation with PorB augments intracellular antigen availability in distinct cellular compartments earlier than without 
PorB. This potentially impacts also antigen processing, which led us to examine the effect of PorB on antigen 
presentation.
PorB formulation drives cell recruitment to secondary lymphoid tissue. 
Antigen delivery and 
APC – T cell interactions within the draining lymph node are essential for the initiation of an adaptive immune 
response. We utilized a hock vaccination model to analyze the effect of PorB on antigen trafficking in vivo33. Each 
mouse served as its own control, receiving OVA-A594 alone or formulated with PorB in one hock and PBS in 
the other. The antigen will drain to popliteal lymph nodes post injection, but fails to cross to the contralateral 
lymph node as this mechanism occurs either through vitreous pressure to the lymph or as an active event relying 
on antigen transport by DCs34. Figure 4 illustrates that PorB, as an adjuvant, significantly increased the presence 
of antigen loaded CD11c+ cells within popliteal lymph nodes (pLN) of wt mice 16 h after injection (Fig. 4e–h),

whereas OVA-A594, alone, did not (Fig. 4a–d). Noteworthy, the number of CD11c+ cells was distinctively higher 
in OVA-A594 + PorB injected mice compared to mice given OVA-A594 alone. When mice were vaccinated with 
OVA-A594 alone or PBS in one limb, and OVA-A594 + PorB in the contralateral limb, significantly more antigen 
positive cells were in the draining pLN of the limb receiving OVA-A594 + PorB as compared to the contralateral 
pLN of the same mouse injected with PBS or OVA-A594 alone (Fig. 5a). Antigen administration with either 
vaccine resulted in significantly increased cell counts compared to PBS control. Furthermore, we detected mark-
edly more antigen bearing CD11c+ CD11b+ cells using flow cytometry in single cell suspensions obtained from 
OVA-A594 + PorB injected mice compared to OVA-A594 alone (Fig. 5b). Control vaccination with PBS resulted 
in no antigen positive CD11c+ CD11b+ cells when the contralateral leg was vaccinated with OVA-A594, confirm-
ing an absence of midline crossover and the validity of our internal controls. Our findings highlight the adjuvan-
ticity and the potency of PorB as a TLR-ligand based vaccine adjuvant in triggering immune cell trafficking into 
the draining lymphoid tissue.
PorB enhances activation of OVA specific T cells in vitro. 
The distinct intracellular antigen local-
ization in prescence of PorB led us to investigate, how PorB modulates and alters antigen presentation. 
Cross-presentation of exogenous antigen via MHC class I constitutes an important pathway to elicit a protective 
cytotoxic CD8 T cell response to clear intracellular pathogens or tumors35, 36. PAMP engagement has been shown 
by many investigators to facilitate and enhance cross-presentation, e.g. for intracellular nucleic acid sensors like 
RIG-I37, STING38 or TLR signaling via TLR3 or TLR939. We hypothesized that PorB, as a TLR2 agonist might 
enhance cross-presentation of soluble OVA. T cells, derived from OT-I transgenic mice are a well established 
model to investigate MHC class I antigen recognition by antigen specific CD8 T cell in in vitro39 and in vivo37. 
OVA antigen uptake, protelytical degradation and presentation in context of MHC class I will trigger recognition 
of the “SIINFEKL” peptide - MHC class I complex on the APC by OT-I derived CD8 T cells. The cellular immune 
response of the CD8 T cells was determined by measuring production of interferon γ
 (IFNγ
) upon antigen stim-
ulation and antigen specific T cell proliferation. We cocultivated OVA or OVA + PorB treated BMDCs (1 h, 2 h 
or 4 h) from either wt or TLR2−
/− deficient mice (Fig. 6) with CFSE labeled splenocytes from OT-I mice, to test 
the effect of PorB formulation on cross-presentation and antigen recognition. Formulation of OVA with PorB 
resulted in significantly higher IFNγ
 production and proliferation by CFSE labeled OT-I T cells cocultivated with 
wt BMDCs (Fig. 6a). IFNγ
 levels in coculture supernatants increased with longer exposure of APCs to PorB com-
pared to OVA only. Notably, OVA protein alone was not sufficient to trigger high levels of IFNγ
 in these assays, 
demonstrating the importance and potency of PorB formulation. In addition, we also measured the proliferation 
of OVA specific CD8 T cells (Supplementary Fig. S2 for gating strategy and proliferation ratio). OVA + PorB

treated wt BMDCs induced significantly higher proliferation of OVA specific CD8 T cells earlier as compared 
to BMDCs treated with OVA alone (Fig. 6b,c). The stimulation of wt and TLR2−
/− BMDCs with OVA257-264 pep-
tide alone and PorB formulated peptide followed by cocultivation with OT-I splenocytes revealed an significant 
increase in IFNγ
 response by OT-I splenocytes (Supplementary Fig. S4a,b) for both genotypes. PorB formulation 
was necessary to induce a TNFα
 and IL-6 cytokine response (data not shown). Our group showed previously 
that PorB induces inreased MHC I and CD86 expression in BMDCs13. This might be a very important underly-
ing molecular mechanism of PorB enhancing antigen specific T cell activation, by increased costimulation and 
MHC expression (Supplementary Fig. S4). In this setup PorB exposure alone was not sufficient to induce a IFNy 
response in OT-I splenocytes. TLR2 signalling was crucial to trigger IFNγ
 production and proliferation in BMDC

– OT-I cocultures (compare Fig. 6b,c and e,f and supplementary Fig. S4). We detected a slight increase in IFNγ
 
production of OT-I derived CD8 T cells in absence of TLR2 when incubated with OVA or OVA + PorB treated 
BMDCs (Fig. 6e,f). We additionally tested the effect of PorB formulation on the IFNγ
 production of OVA specific 
CD4 T cells utilizing OT-II transgenic mice, recognizing a distinct CD4 T cell eptitope within OVA in context of 
MHC class II. PorB enhanced the antigen presentation of soluble OVA in wt BMDCs significantly with respect 
to IFNγ
 levels in OT-II cocultures compared to OVA only (Supplementary Fig. S5a), similar to our findings in 
the OT-I – BMDC cocultures. The IFNγ
 production in both OT-I and OT-II cocultivation assays, triggered by 
TLR2−
/− BMDCs, was greatly reduced and only a fraction as compared with wt derived BMDCs (Fig. 6d, supp-
lemetal Fig. S5b). However, both genotypes, C57Bl/6 and TLR2−
/− derived BMDCs, exhibited increases in IL-6

and TNFα
 production (Supplementary Fig. S3), when PorB was present as compared to OVA alone or OVA pep-
tide control. Cytokine levels of TLR2 deficient BMDCs were markedly less compared to C57Bl/6 derived BMDCs 
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The reduced proliferation in OT-I splenocytes cocultivated with TLR2−
/− BMDCs and 
the limited IFNγ
 response of cocultered OT-I and OT-II derived T cells confirm and strengthen the importance 
of TLR2 signaling in PorB’s adjuvant activity.
PorB triggers OVA specific CD8 T cell immune response in vivo. 
Vaccines containing PorB are potent 
inducers of immune responses21, 22. However, the underlying T cell response has not been characterized in depth. 
Based on the hock vaccination model, we injected wt and TLR2−
/− mice, twice, intramuscularly into the tibialis 
anterior with either OVA alone or OVA + PorB as described40. Ten and twelve days post booster vaccination 
(Supplementary Fig. S6a for vaccination setup) mice were sacrificed and single cell splenocyte suspensions were 
re-stimulated ex vivo with OVA peptide or a control peptide and analyzed for the presence of intracellular IFNγ
 
and TNFα
 using flow cytometry (gating strategy in supplementary Fig. S6b). We found significantly more IFNγ
 
and TNFα
 producing CD8 T cells ten and twelve days post booster vaccination in wt mice immunized with 
OVA + PorB (Fig. 7) as compared to OVA alone. Notably, PorB was able to induce a minor amount of OVA 
specific CD8 T cells even in TLR2 deficient mice. OVA + PorB immunized TLR2−
/− mice did show significantly 
more IFNγ
 and TNFα
 positive CD8 T cells upon ex vivo stimulation with OVA257-264 peptide on day twelve. IFNγ
 
and TNFα
 levels were comparable to those found in wt mice (Fig. 7a,c), although showing greater variability.

 and TNFα
 as the readout. Two independent experiments were combined for

There was no difference in the specific CD8 T cell response comparing day ten and day twelve post booster vacci-
nation in wt and TLR2−
/− mice. In addition, we determined the OVA specific humoral response using IgG ELISA 
(Supplemetary Fig. S7). The OVA specific humoral response was significantly higher when PorB was present in 
the vaccine in the wt mice at day twelve post booster injection (Supplemetary Fig. S7a,b) The IgG response pat-
tern for day ten followed the same trend (data not shown). The IgG titers in TLR2−
/− mice reached only about 
1/10 of the IgG titers in wt mice with the OVA + PorB vaccine (compare supplemetary Fig. S7a and b) consistent 
with previous results published from our group22.
In summary, the adaptive cellular as well humoral immune response against soluble OVA formulated with 
PorB is significantly higher than OVA alone, even in the absence of TLR2. The increased CD8 T cell response, in 
both wt and TLR2−
/− mice, indicates that the CD8 T cell immune response triggered by PorB is partially inde-
pendent of the presence of TLR2 as receptor for PorB. A similar finding has been reported for synthetic TLR2 
ligands covalently fused to peptides41. The TLR2-independent cytokine induction might be a possible reason 
accounting for the ability of PorB to induce some adjuvant activity in TLR2−
/− mice. The residual TLR2 inde-
pendent immune response, might be attributable to PorB’s particulated and aggregated form (Supplementary 
Fig. S8), which could enhance antigen availability in the draining lymphatics similar to virus like particles (VLPs) 
and nanoparticles42.
Discussion
The inherent adjuvant effect in most attenuated or inactivated vaccine preparations is mainly attributable to the 
involvement of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) recognizing PAMPs43, 44. Poorly immunogenic subunit vac-
cines rely on the formulation with adjuvants to induce humoral as well as cellular protective immune responses. 
PRR agonists, as conserved PAMPs, are becoming increasingly attractive adjuvants. They are used in experimen-
tal vaccine formulations and are currently in the focus of intense research2. TLR agonists, as one example for PRR 
ligands, are capable of modulating and shaping the resulting immune response, based on their receptor usage 
and admixed non-TLR adjuvants. The triggered immune response can include humoral responses, T-helper 1 
and 2 (Th1, Th2) responses, and cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses or combinations thereof. Lipid A analogues, e.g. 
MPLA, bind to TLR4 and trigger a specific antibody and TH1 directed immune response45. CpG ODNs in con-
trast, stimulate via TLR9 and vaccine antigen formulation with CpG results in humoral, Th1 directed, and CD8 
T cell response46, 47. Outer Membrane Protein Complexes (OMPCs) isolated from Neisseria meningitidis were 
used as carrier for Haemophilus influenza B (Hib) capsular polysaccharide as part of the Hib-OMPC vaccine23 
and induced immune responses with Th2 characteristics, relying on T cell help. PorB, a known TLR2 ligand with 
adjuvant activity, is one of the major constituents of this vaccine. In the present study we examined the effect 
of purified PorB on intracellular antigen shuttling, antigen-presenting cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes 
and the antigen specific T cell immune response of the well-characterized model antigen ovalbumin, as a meas-
ure of PorB’s adjuvant activity. Our findings extend the knowledge on how PorB acts as potent adjuvant and 
immunomodulator.
Our group previously demonstrated that PorB induces inflammatory cytokines and the presence of TLR2 was 
crucial for PorB to act as an adjuvant27, 28. TLR2 agonists have been described to favor antigen uptake and alter 
the immune response outcome48, 49. TLR2 also, recognizes ligands in combination with TLR1, TLR6 or TLR10 (in 
humans) as heterodimers leading to a wide range of ligands such as lipoproteins, lipopeptides or peptidoglycans. 
The downstream signaling involves MyD88 as an adaptor protein. Pam3CSK4, a synthetic TLR2 agonist, enhances 
antigen uptake and cross-presentation of apoptotic cells50. Subunit vaccines composed of a synthetic TLR2/TLR6 
ligand, namely Pam2Cys, covalently linked to CD4 T cell epitopes and target epitopes, triggered humoral as well 
as cellular immune responses51 strengthening the role for TLR2 agonists as effective adjuvants. In this study we 
utilized purified PorB, which stimulates cells via TLR2/1 and was isolated from a mutant Neisseria meningitidis 
strain lacking Rmp and PorA to minimize protein contamination. Furthermore a distinct method of preparation 
was used to eliminate possible LPS contamination52. The vaccine itself is generated by simply mixing PorB, for-
mulated into protein nanoparticles, termed proteosomes21, 53 with the target antigen, these preparations do not 
require covalent linkage of antigen and adjuvant. This makes PorB an ideal adjuvant candidate targeting TLR2. 
However, PorB did not significantly increase the antigen uptake of fluorescently labeled OVA formulated with 
PorB, but accelerated the presence of antigen in the endo-/lysosomal compartment. It rather modulates and 
accelerates the antigen shuttling. In light of that, we show that PorB triggers an inflammatory cytokine response 
in BMDCs as early as 2 h of stimulation in the coincubation assays and enhances the antigen localization within 
the endo-/lysosomal compartment (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Fig. 2). The endo-/lysosomal localization of anti-
gen is particularly important for the resulting immune response, which needs prior antigen processing by APCs 
and costimulation of either CD4 T cells or CD8 T cells via MHC. PorB, as a TLR2 agonist enhances the antigen 
targeting to endosomes (Figs 2 and 3). Together with the increase in costimulatory molecules and surface MHC13, 
this leads possibly to improved antigen presentation and increased here CD8 and CD4 T cell activation (Fig. 6 
and supplementary Figs S4 and S5). Similarily, a TLR2 binding antibody was shown to augment the shuttling of 
antigen into the MHC II processing cellular compartment and enhance CD4 T cell activation54.
The exact molecular mechanisms by which PorB facilitates the antigen uptake and transport into endosomes 
are still under investigation and not fully clarified. Endocytosis mediated by Pam3CSK4 as part of a conjugate 
vaccine has been shown to be clathrin- and/or caveolin dependent41. This could also be attributable to PorB medi-
ated endocytosis. PorB might utilize two distinct mechanisms for antigen uptake and intracellular processing to 
induce immune responses similar to what was shown for Pam3CSK4
41
. We cannot exclude that PorB interacts with 
other intracellular receptors and/or enhances the transport of OVA into phagolysosomes for efficient antigen 
processing/-presentation on MHC II14 and/or MHC I55.
Once stimulated, APCs will conceivably enhance their cellular trafficking to draining lymph nodes and initiate 
crosstalk with cells from the adaptive immunity41. Interaction between APCs and T cells occurs in the peripheral

lymphoid tissue and requires prior antigen transport to the lymph node56. To investigate antigen trafficking, 
we utilized a hock vaccination system33, which yielded increased cellularity and triggered trafficking of antigen 
bearing CD11b− CD11c+ DCs to the popliteal lymph node within 16 h (Figs 4 and 5) after OVA-A594 + PorB 
injection. We utilized APC – T cell costimulation assays to measure CD8 and CD4 T cell activation, in order 
to characterize their interaction. Previously, our lab showed PorB-induced APC activation via upregulation of 
cellular activation markers and costimulatory molecules, e.g. MHC I, MHC II, CD40, CD54, CD69 or CD86 
in different APC types13, 22, 52. We have also shown that PorB formulated vaccines with OVA trigger a balanced 
Th1/Th2 immune response13, 22 inducing proliferation of antigen specific B cells57. In this report we provided evi-
dence that PorB enhances in vitro antigen presentation to CD4 and CD8 T cells (Supplementary Fig. S5, Fig. 6). 
An OVA specific CD8 T cell activation/response requires presentation of OVA in context of MHC I, which we 
demonstrate in Figs 6 and 7. In vitro, PorB induced minimal cross-presentation of OVA in the absence of TLR2 
(Fig. 6), but a significant inflammatory cytokine response (Supplementary Fig. S3). In vivo, we show that PorB is 
capable of inducing antigen specific CD8 T cells, measured by INFγ
 and proliferation, and increased IgGs, which 
were reduced but not totally absent when TLR2 was not present (Supplementary Fig. S7 and Fig. 7). A potential 
underlying reason for the discrepancy of slightly diminished CTL response and reduced humoral response in wt 
versus TLR2−
/− mice might be due to the particulate nature of PorB administered as an adjuvant52, 53. Subjected 
to non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), PorB proteosomes break down, due to the electric 
charge and appear as multimers, reflecting the molecular size of about 120–250 kDa with the trimeric PorB form 
most prominent at 120 kDa (Supplementary Fig. S8a). On a denaturing SDS-PAGE PorB trimers break down and 
the monomeric form of Neisseria meningitidis PorB runs at 39 kDa (Supplementary Fig. S8b). The nanoparticulate 
structure of PorB proteosomes could be one reason for the TLR2 independent induction of cytokines of CD8 T 
cells in vivo and in vitro and needs further investigation. The PorB proteosomes are larger protein aggregates com-
posed of trimeric PorB and vary in size from 10 nm to 20 nm. The particulate nature of a vaccine greatly enhances 
its trafficking efficacy and the resulting immune response42, 58, this might be also applicaple to PorB proteosomes 
which are basically nanoparticles and TLR agonists at the same time.
In summary, we have demonstrated that PorB acts through two innate immunity pathways not previously 
reported in the adjuvant activity of PorB, namely APC trafficking and antigen cross-presentation. PorB as par-
ticulate and soluble adjuvant can modulate both pathways simultaneously and enhances the immune response 
outcome. This represents an essential mechanism of action for PorB and will be important in the development of 
next-generation vaccine adjuvants, especially for potential combination with new adjuvants.
Materials and Methods
Mice. 
Six-week-old female C57Bl/6 J (referred to as wt and C57Bl/6, stock #000664) mice, B6.Cg-
Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J (referred to as OT-II, stock #004194) and C57BL/6-Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J (referred to 
as OT-I, stock #003831) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). TLR2−
/− mice59 (on the 
C57Bl/6 genetic background) were a gift from Dr. S. Akira (Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka 
University, Osaka, Japan). All mice were maintained within the Laboratory Animal Science Center (LASC) at 
Boston University School of Medicine and used at 8–16 weeks of age. The Boston University Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all research conducted using animal models. Experiments were 
conducted in accordance to IACUC guidelines.
Generation of Bone Marrow Derived Dendritic cells (BMDCs). 
BMDCs were generated from both 
femurs and tibiae of C57Bl/6 and TLR2−
/− mice60. Briefly, single cell suspensions were generated flushing bones 
using a 25 G needle and filtered through a 70 µm nylon mesh (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). Erythrocytes 
were lysed with ACK lysis buffer (150 mM NaH4Cl, 50 mM KHCO3) and washed in PBS. Afterwards cells were 
counted and plated at a density of 3 ×
 105 cells per ml in non-coated petri dishes, supplemented with 20 ng/
ml murine rGMCSF (Sigma-Aldrich, #SRP3201) containing RPMI-1640 with 10% FCS (Gibco), 100 U/ml 
Penicillin-Streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) (referred to as R-10). Four days post generation 5 ml 20 ng/ml murine 
rGMCSF containing R-10 media was added to cell culture. Non-adherent BMDCs were harvested and pelleted on 
day 6 for antigen uptake assays and treated as indicated.
Vaccination of mice. 
Immune cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes was investigated using a hock 
vaccination model as described33. Briefly, wt mice were restrained and 10 μ
l of formulated vaccine (PBS, 5 μ
g 
OVA-A594 alone and 5 μ
g OVA-A594 + 10 μ
g PorB) was injected into the lateral aspect of the ankle, avoiding all 
major blood vessels. One group (n = 8) received PBS (control) in one ankle and OVA-A594 in the second. The 
other group (n = 8) of the mice was vaccinated with OVA-A594 in one ankle and OVA-A594/PorB in the second. 
For determination of OVA specific T cell responses C57Bl/6 and TLR2−
/− (n = 3–4) were immunized into the tibi-
alis anterior muscle as described previously40. Mice received two vaccinations 20 days apart with either 10 μ
g OVA 
alone or OVA formulated with 10 μ
g PorB. Mice were sacrificed 10 respectively 12 days post booster vaccination 
and splenocytes were ex vivo stimulated with peptides as indicated. Mice were bled prior to prime, before booster 
and terminally to determine OVA specific immunoglobulin levels.
Determination of OVA specific T cell response. 
Single splenocyte cell suspensions were stimulated with 
peptides in UltraCulture (Lonza, #12-725 F) as described previously61. Briefly, splenocytes (5 ×
 105/100 μ
l) were 
pulsed for 4 h with 2.5 μ
g/ml peptides purchased from Anaspec (USA) in the presence of 5 μ
g/ml brefeldin A 
(Sigma-Aldrich, #B7651-5mg) in serum free media. (Peptide list: control peptide OVAscrambled (FILKSINE) or 
OVA257-264 (SIINFEKL) CD8 T cell peptide). Afterwards cells were washed in FACS buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% 
sodium azide) and incubated with CD16/CD32 Fc receptor block for 15 minutes at 4 °C (eBioscience, USA). 
Samples were stained with CD8 – APC-Cy7 antibodies for 20 minutes. Surface stained cells were fixed with 2%

paraformaldehyde and afterwards permeabilized with permeabilization buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.5% saponin, 
0.05% sodium azide) for 15 minutes at RT. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed with anti-IFNγ
 – FITC 
and anti-TNFα
 – APC fluorescent conjugate antibodies for 30 minutes at RT in permeabilization buffer and 
afterwards washed twice with FACS buffer. Cells were resuspended in PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA. Data 
acquisition was performed on a BD LSRII and afterwards analyzed using FlowJo (version 10.0.8).
Cytokine ELISA. 
Cytokine levels in supernatants of stimulated or cocultivated cells were determined as 
follows: TNFα
 and IL-6 levels in supernatants of stimulated BMDCs were determined using the Mouse TNF 
alpha ELISA Ready-SET-Go kit (eBioscience, #88-7324-88) and IL-6 using the Mouse IL-6 DuoSet ELISA (R&D 
Systems, #DY406), according to manufacturer’s recommendation. Interferon β
 (IFNβ
) levels in supernatants were 
analyzed using a customized sandwich ELISA as described62. Briefly, 2HB plates were coated with monoclonal 
IFNβ
 antibody (0.1 μ
g/ml) (Santa Cruz, #sc-57201) in carbonate buffer. Samples and known IFNβ
 standard con-
centrations (PBL assay science, #12405-1) were incubated over night after blocking wells for 2 h with PBS/BSA 
1%. IFNβ
 was detected using an anti-mouse IFNβ
, polyclonal rabbit IgG (1:2000), (PBL assay science, #32400-1) 
for 2 h and donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody, HRP conjugated (1:2000) (EMD Millipore, #AP182P) for 1 h. BD 
HRP substrate (BD, #555214) was used to develop ELISA at 450 nm. Interferon gamma (IFNγ
) was measured 
using BD OptEIA Elisa (BD, #555138) sandwich ELISA. OD values for TNFα
, IL-6, IFNβ
 and IFNγ
 were deter-
mined at 450 nm and calculated based on standard curves generated by known amounts of recombinant TNFα
, 
IL-6, IFNβ
 and IFNγ
 using GraphPad Prism (version 6.0).
CFSE proliferation assay. 
OT-I splenocytes were stained with 5 μ
M CFSE (LifeTechnologies, USA) and 
cocultivated with stimulated BMDCs for 3 days at an effector target ratio of 4:1 in 96 U-well plates. APCs were 
stimulated prior to coculture with 10 μ
g OVA alone or formulated with 10 μ
g PorB. BMDCs were treated with 
50 μ
g/ml Mitomycin C (Fisher Scientific, USA) for 30 minutes and washed twice with PBS prior to coculture 
setup. Activation of BMDCs was verified using TNFα
 and IL-6 ELISA as described above. Supernatant of OT-I 
and OT-II BMDC cocultures were analyzed using IFNγ
 ELISA as described above. Proliferation of OT-I CD8 T 
cells was assessed using flow cytometry. Briefly, cells were stained with LD stain (Zombie Aqua, Biolegend, USA) 
for 20 minutes and afterwards treated with CD16/CD32 Fc block (as describe above). Samples were stained with 
CD8-APC-Cy7 and CD4 – PE and analyzed on a BD LSRII.
Immunofluorescence imaging of pulsed BMDCs and lymph node sections. 
In vitro matured 
BMDCs (4 ×
 105 cells/ml) were seeded on day 5 on fibronectin coated glass cover slips (Neuvitro, Germany) and 
pulsed in 24 well plates. Cells were rested over night in rGMCSF containing R-10 media and allowed to adhere 
prior to stimulation on day 6 with OVA-A594 [5 μ
g/ml] admixed with or without PorB [10 μ
g/ml] for 30 minutes 
or 2 h respectively. Afterwards cells were fixed in 2% PFA for 10 minutes at RT and permeabilized using 0.1% 
Triton X-100 (MP Biomedicals, USA) for 10 minutes. Cells were washed in PBS and block was performed for 
30 minutes using PBS-BSA (5%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). BMDCs were stained with primary antibody against early 
endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1, anti-mouse raised in goat, Santa Cruz, USA) and lysosomal-associated membrane 
protein1 (LAMP1, anti-mouse raised in rat, Biolegend, USA) for 45 minutes in PBS/BSA (1%). After 4 washes with 
PBS/BSA (1%) cells were stained for 1 h with secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:400 (anti-goat-Alexa-647, 
anti-rat-Alexa-488; Life Technologies, USA). Coverslips were mounted onto slides after extensive washing with 
PBS using DAPI SlowFade Gold Mountant media (Invitrogen, USA). Pictures were acquired on a Leica TCS SP5 
confocal microscope at the Cellular Imaging Core at the Boston University, equipped with a 405 nm diode, an 
argon laser and laser lines for 488 nm, 594 nm and 633 nm allowing simultenous acquisition of up to 4 channels 
with the Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (LAS AF) software. Image acquisition of BMDCs was 
performed, using the 63x oil immersion objective. Images were captured with 4 lines average at 200 Hz with a 
resolution of 1024 ×
 1024. Colocalization analysis was performed using ImageJ (NIH) as described63. Briefly, 
three representative images were selected and five cells per image were selected individually using the lasso tool. 
The background was subtracted for each cell separately using a rolling ball radius of 20.0 pixels. Afterwards an 
unsharp mask filter was applied (radius: 1.8 pixels, maskweight: 0.6). Colocalization was determined using the 
JaCoP plugin in ImageJ calculating the Pearson Colocalization Coefficient64.
Popliteal lymph node sections were obtained 16 h after hock immunization and embedded in Optimal 
Cutting Temperature (OCT) medium (Richard Allan Scientific) in molds (ThermoFisher). Samples were fro-
zen in an ethanol and dry ice mixture and stored at −
80 °C. Sectioning was performed on a Microm HM 550 
(Microm International GmbH, Germany). 8 μ
m sections were obtained and placed on Colorfrost Plus slides 
(ThermoFisher, USA) and stored at −
80 °C until staining. Sections were air dried for 15 minutes at room temper-
ature, then fixed in acetone at −
20 °C for 10 minutes and air dried for 10 minutes. Sections were re-hydrated in 
TBS buffer with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) then blocked for 20 minutes at room temperature with TBS-T with 5% 
BSA. Sections were rinsed with TBS-T and then stained with antibodies for 1 h followed by two rinses with TBS-T 
and incubated in a TBS-T bath for 5 minutes on an orbital shaker. The following antibodies and reagents were 
used: APC hamster anti-mouse CD11c (BD) and OVA-A594 (Invitrogen, USA). Stained sections were mounted 
in Fluoroshield mounting medium with DAPI (Abcam) and dried overnight. A Leica SP5 confocal microscope 
(Leica AG) was used to examine the sections using the Leica LAS AF software as described above using the 40x 
and 63x oil immersion objectives. The images were arranged using ImageJ (NIH).
Statistics. 
Statistics were calculated in GraphPad Prism (version 6.0). Differences in cytokine production by 
stimulated C57Bl/6 BMDCs have been calculated using Two-way non-parametric ANOVA with the Sidak test 
for multiple comparisons. Significance levels for cocultivation assays and humoral immune response were deter-
mined using Two-way non-parametric ANOVA with Tukey correction for multiple comparisons. Colocalization

analysis was assessed using Pearson Correlation coefficients calculated as described above. Differences in in vitro 
antigen colocalization, in vivo cell counts, antigen positive DCs in draining lymph nodes and specific CD8 T 
cell responses in vaccinated mice were calculated using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Significance 
Levels were: n.d. below threshold, ns P > 0.05, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.
