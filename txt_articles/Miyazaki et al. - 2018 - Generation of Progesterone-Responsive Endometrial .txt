SUMMARY
Defective endometrial stromal fibroblasts (EMSFs) contribute to uterine factor infertility, endometriosis, and endometrial cancer. Induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from skin or bone marrow biopsies provide a patient-specific source that can be differentiated to
various cells types. Replacement of abnormal EMSFs is a potential novel therapeutic approach for endometrial disease; however, the
methodology or mechanism for differentiating iPSCs to EMSFs is unknown. The uterus differentiates from the intermediate mesoderm
(IM) to form coelomic epithelium (CE) followed by the Mu
¨llerian duct (MD). Here, we successfully directed the differentiation of human
iPSCs (hiPSCs) through IM, CE, and MD to EMSFs under molecularly defined embryoid body culture conditions using specific hormonal
treatments. Activation of CTNNB1 was essential for expression of progesterone receptor that mediated the final differentiation step of
EMSFs before implantation. These hiPSC-derived tissues illustrate the potential for iPSC-based endometrial regeneration for future
cell-based treatments.
INTRODUCTION
The endometrium comprises a multilayered mucosa within
the uterus. In preparation for the implantation of an em-
bryo, it proliferates, differentiates, degenerates, and regener-
ates in a cyclical manner in response to ovarian steroid
hormones (Maruyama and Yoshimura, 2008; Miyazaki
et al., 2012). Estrogen and progesterone bind to their respec-
tive receptors ER and PGR and directly regulate the
transcription of various genes involved in endometrial
physiology.
Defective
endometrial
stromal
fibroblast
(EMSF) function, particularly abnormal responses to proges-
terone, play key roles in the development of various types of
endometrial disorders, including endometriosis and endo-
metrial cancer. Endometriosis is a painful and persistent
gynecological disease that affects approximately 10% of
women of reproductive age. Extrauterine growth of endo-
metrium-like tissue results in severe pelvic pain, infertility,
and development of adhesions (Bulun, 2009; Dyson et al.,
2014; Giudice, 2010; Mahmood and Templeton, 1991).
Studies have demonstrated an insufficient response to pro-
gesterone in EMSFs from women with endometriosis, which
directly affects the stromal-epithelial interactions necessary
for normal cycling and function of the endometrium (Kim
et al., 2013). Unresponsiveness of EMSFs to progesterone
also underlies the pathogenesis of steroid hormone-depen-
dent endometrial cancer (type 1), the most prevalent gyne-
cologic malignancy in the western world, with a rising
incidence in the United States (Siegel et al., 2013).
Cell replacement therapies have garnered substantial
public and scientific attention as a viable option to replace
cells lost or damaged in various disease processes (Daley,
2012; Mutlu et al., 2015). EMSF replacement therapy to
restore progesterone responsiveness may similarly provide
a novel therapeutic approach to endometrial disease such
as endometriosis. The most tractable source of normal
EMSFs applicable for clinical use are EMSFs differentiated
from
patient-derived
induced
pluripotent
stem
cells
(iPSCs). Human iPSCs (hiPSCs) have been developed using
non-integrating episomal factors or synthetic mRNA, pro-
ducing safer iPSCs with the same efficacy and pluripotency
as those derived through viral means (Warren et al., 2010;
Yu et al., 2007).
Currently, there is no published method available for
differentiating EMSFs from iPSCs. Moreover, the underly-
ing mechanisms for the differentiation of tissue endome-
trial stem/progenitor cells to EMSFs are not known
(Maruyama et al., 2010). We hypothesize that differentia-
tion of iPSCs to EMSFs would mimic the in vivo stages of
uterine development during embryogenesis. It is also likely
that later stages of this process may simulate the steroid-
dependent differentiation of tissue progenitor cells to
mature endometrial stromal cells. The uterus is a meso-
dermal organ that originates from the intermediate meso-
derm (IM). During embryogenesis, IM emerges from the
posterior primitive streak (PS) and gives rise to the coelomic
epithelium (CE). Invagination of CE during fetal develop-
ment forms the Mu
¨llerian duct (MD) (Guioli et al., 2007;

 Hashimoto, 2003), which then gives rise to the human
female reproductive tract, including the oviduct, uterus,
and upper vaginal canal (Hashimoto, 2003). Published
findings strongly suggest a critical role of the WNT/
CTNNB1 pathway in the differentiation of Mu
¨llerian tis-
sues (Deutscher and Hung-Chang Yao, 2007; Stewart
et al., 2013). Recently, hiPSCs have been differentiated
into IM-derived cells that express renal cell lineage markers
(Araoka et al., 2014; Morizane et al., 2015), providing a crit-
ical starting point for differentiating hiPSCs to EMSFs.
We developed a molecularly defined system for differen-
tiating hiPSCs to EMSFs, whereby embryoid bodies (EBs) of
hiPSCs reproducibly recapitulate the hierarchical differen-
tiation stages of PS, IM, CE, and MD. The hiPSC-derived
EMSFs
expressed
the
critical
endometrial
markers
HOXA10, HOXA11, and PGR within 14 days of initiation
of differentiation (Du and Taylor, 2015; Mote et al.,
1999). Prolonged treatment of the hiPSC-derived EMSFs
with a time-honored cocktail containing estrogen and pro-
gestin, strikingly induced the decidualization (endometrial
stromal differentiation) markers FOXO1, HAND2, IGFBP1,
and PRL (Buzzio et al., 2006). We predict that histocompat-
ible EMSFs derived from a patients’ own cells will permit
the development of tailored cell therapies for the endome-
trial disease. This work represents the first step in devel-
oping a cell-based therapeutic approach for women who
suffer from uterine factor infertility or endometriosis. The
ability to generate functional endometrial tissue from
hiPSCs may also create new models for studying endome-
trial development and pathophysiology, as well as for
drug screening. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
WNT/CTNNB1 pathway is a key regulator of PGR expres-
sion during differentiation of hiPSCs. This finding may
be a game changer for novel molecular therapy to improve
progesterone resistance seen in a variety of endometrial
diseases.
RESULTS
Differentiation of hiPSCs to Intermediate Mesoderm
via the Primitive Streak
We differentiated hiPSCs to IM via the posterior PS using a
previously established protocol (Figure 1A) (Lam et al.,
2014). We first cultured hiPSCs for 1 day in plates with mi-
crowells designed to facilitate aggregation of pluripotent
stem cells into EBs. Day 1 (D1) EBs were treated for 36 hr
with 5 mM CHIR99021 (CHIR), a potent GSK3B inhibi-
tor/CTNNB1 pathway agonist, to generate D2.5 EBs. Tran-
script levels of T and TBX6, genes that are predominantly
expressed in PS, were significantly higher in D2.5 EBs
versus hiPSCs (Figure 1B) (D’Amour et al., 2005; Gadue
et al., 2006). Upregulation of T protein was confirmed by
immunostaining (Figure 1C) and immunoblot (Figure 1D).
Quantitative analysis of the immunohistochemistry re-
vealed that the percentage of T+ cells was significantly
higher in D2.5 compared with D1 (94.5% ± 1.0% versus
9.3% ± 2.3%, p < 0.05) (Figure S1A). Since it is difficult to
perform antigen retrieval followed by immunostaining
for plated cells in culture, we used D1 EB for immunostain-
ing in place of hiPSC.
Differentiation of pluripotent stem cells is accompanied
by a loss of pluripotency (Lam et al., 2014). Since hiPSCs
share many properties with epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs)
(Han et al., 2011), we examined the expression of the EpiSC
genes NANOG, ZFP42, and SOX2, as well as KLF4, a gene
used to generate hiPSCs (Takahashi et al., 2007), to verify
the pluripotency of the EBs. Decreases in mRNA levels of
NANOG, ZFP42, and KLF4 were observed in D2.5 EBs
compared with hiPSCs (Figure 1B). Downregulation of
SOX2 was confirmed by immunostaining (Figure 1C) as
the quantitative analysis of immunohistochemistry re-
vealed that the percentage of SOX2+ cells was significantly
lower in D2.5 compared with D1 (92.9% ± 1.9% versus
1.4% ± 0.3%, p < 0.05) (Figure S1A). Downregulation of
NANOG and SOX2 was also confirmed by immunoblot
(Figure 1D).
EpiSCs can also differentiate ectoderm cells, early-gas-
trula organizer, and primordial germ cell precursors as
well as PS (Arango and Donahoe, 2008; Davidson and
Tam, 2000; Zimmerlin et al., 2017). We evaluated D2.5
EBs for the expression of markers for those derivatives to
assess the purity of PS differentiation: PAX6 for ectoderm
(Lam et al., 2014), LHX1 for early-gastrula organizer (David-
son and Tam, 2000), and PRDM14 for primordial germ cell
precursors (Arango and Donahoe, 2008). We found that
mRNA expression was unchanged or downregulated in
D2.5 EBs compared with hiPSCs (Figure S1B).
A switch in cadherin protein expression from CDH1 to
CDH2 indicates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
during

hiPSCs.
D2.5
EBs
showed
decreased expression of CDH1 and increased expression
of CDH2 by immunohistochemistry compared with D1
EBs, consistent with cell migration through the PS, as
seen during development (Figure 1C) (Ramkumar and An-
derson, 2011). Specifically, the quantitative data showed
the
following:
CDH1+,
3.9%
±
0.1%
versus
100%,
p < 0.05; CDH2+, 100% versus 8.3% ± 0.7%, p < 0.05 (Fig-
ure S1A). Together, these findings demonstrated the
potency of CHIR to induce differentiation of hiPSCs into
PS-like cells via a program that mimics normal develop-
ment in vivo.
In the next step, D2.5 EBs (PS stage) were treated with
1 mM retinoic acid (RA) and fibroblast growth factor 2
(FGF2) for 36 hr (Figure 1A). We examined whether D4
EBs are committed to the IM lineage by measuring the

 expression of LHX1, OSR1, and PAX2, which are expressed
in the developing IM (Lam et al., 2014; Mugford et al.,
2008). A marked increase in LHX1, OSR1, and PAX2
mRNA expression was observed in D4 EBs compared with
hiPSCs (Figure 1E). We confirmed protein expression of
LHX1 and PAX2 in D4 EBs by immunohistochemistry (Fig-
ure 1F) and immunoblot (Figure 1G). Quantitative analysis
of the immunohistochemistry revealed that the percent-
ages of LHX1+ cells and PAX2+ cells were significantly
higher in D4 compared with D2.5 (96.5% ± 0.5% versus
0%, p < 0.05; 96.0% ± 0.6% versus 1.1% ± 1.1%, p < 0.05,
respectively) (Figure S1C).
Because PS can also give rise to lateral plate mesoderm
and hemangioblast (Palpant et al., 2017), we also evaluated
the D4 EBs for mRNA expression of markers GATA4 (Gao
et al., 2016) and CD34 (Young et al., 1995). We found
that expression of these markers was downregulated or un-
changed compared with D2.5 EBs (Figure S1D). SOX17,
which is a marker for endoderm originating from the ante-
rior PS (Familari, 2006), was also unchanged in the D4 EBs
(Figure S1D). We therefore concluded that D4 EBs were
representative of IM.
Differentiation of Intermediate Mesoderm to
Coelomic Epithelium
All MD components derive from IM through CE (Hashi-
moto, 2003), and the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway mediates
the development of MD (Deutscher and Hung-Chang
Yao, 2007; Stewart et al., 2013). We hypothesized that acti-
vation of the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway, in addition to
several other growth factors, could reproduce MD develop-
ment from IM (D4 EBs) in vitro. We added the WNT/
CTNNB1 pathway activator CHIR, along with NOGGIN
and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), to D4
EB cultures for 2 days (Figure 2A). Because BMP7 is ex-
pressed in the Wolffian duct and induces nephrogenesis
from IM (Little et al., 2010), we added the BMP antagonist
NOGGIN to suppress nephrogenesis. PDGF-BB was added
based on its ability to differentiate human embryonic
stem cells into Mu
¨llerian lineage cells in a previously pub-
lished protocol (Yu et al., 2015).
To
determine
whether
EB
treatment
with
CHIR,
NOGGIN, and PDGF-BB for 2 days induced the develop-
ment of IM to CE, we examined the expression of CE
markers (and lack of IM markers) in treated or untreated
(vehicle control) D6 EBs. mRNA levels of PDGFRA and
TCF21, genes that are predominantly expressed in CE (Wil-
helm et al., 2007) (Edson et al., 2009), were significantly
higher in D6 EBs compared with hiPSCs (Figure 2B)
although PDGFRA expression was lower in the treated D6
EBs compared with vehicle-control-treated D6 EBs (Fig-
ure 2B). Upregulation of PDGFRA protein was confirmed
by immunostaining (Figure 2C) and immunoblot (Fig-
ure 2D). We used flow cytometry to assess the distribution
of PDGFRA-positive cells in D6 EBs. Via plotting forward-
scatter (FSC) against fluorescence intensity in the PE chan-
nel obtained from the unstained control, we identified two
populations: populations with low and high background of
PE (Figure 2E). However, in D6 EBs stained with the
PDGFRA antibody, 26.8% ± 2.5% of cells were positive for
PDGFRA when the positive gate was positioned to exclude
the high PE population although the majority of D6 EB
cells were PDGFRA positive after immunostaining (Figures
2C and 2E). This may be due to the variable sensitivity
of the different antibodies used for each procedure and
also the nature of the individual procedures. Addition of

 CHIR, NOGGIN, and PDGF-BB also significantly sup-
pressed
the
expression
of
markers
for
mesonephros
(NGFR) (Wilhelm et al., 2007) and metanephric mesen-
chyme (EYA1) (Little et al., 2010) in D6 EBs compared
with vehicle-control-treated D6 EBs (Figure 2F). mRNA
levels of the Wolffian duct marker RET (Little et al., 2010)
were not changed among D4 EBs, treated D6 EBs, and
vehicle-control-treated D6 EBs (Figure 2F).
Withdrawal of CHIR significantly increased the mRNA
levels of PDGFRA and TCF21 (CE markers), but it also
enhanced the expression of EYA1 (metanephric mesen-
chyme) and RET (Wolffian duct) (Figures S1E and S1F),
whereas withdrawal of NOGGIN significantly increased
the mRNA level of EYA1 but did not affect the expression
of PDGFRA or TCF21 (Figures S1E and S1F). Our data
suggested that withdrawal of PDGF-BB enhanced the
expression of EYA1 although there was no statistically sig-
nificant difference (p = 0.06) (Figure S1F). We therefore
concluded that the combination of CHIR, NOGGIN, and
PDGF-BB is the most optimal cocktail for the differentia-
tion of IM to CE.
We further tested the effects of varying durations of treat-
ment with CHIR, NOGGIN, and PDGF-BB by assaying the
expression of differentiation markers from days 5 to 7.
Although mRNA levels of PDGFRA and TCF21 were signif-
icantly higher in D7 EBs compared with D6 EBs, there was
an insignificant trend that D7 EBs expressed more EYA1
and RET compared with D6 EBs (p = 0.06) (Figures S1G
and S1H). D5 EBs showed significantly higher expression
of EYA1 and RET compared with D6 EBs, whereas mRNA
levels of PDGFRA and TCF21 were comparable between
D5 EBs and D6 EBs (Figures S1G and S1H). We therefore
concluded that D6 is the best time point for CE before pro-
ceeding to MD.
Differentiation of Coelomic Epithelium into
Mu
¨llerian Duct
We then cultured D6 EBs with CHIR and NOGGIN for an
additional 2 days (i.e., removed PDGF-BB) (Figure 2A),
and examined the expression of MD markers and lack of
expression of genes typically found in other CE derivatives.
mRNA levels of ISL1 and PAX2, genes that are predomi-
nantly expressed in MD (Kobayashi and Behringer, 2003),
were significantly increased in D8 EBs compared with
vehicle control D8 EBs or hiPSCs (Figure 2G). Protein
expression of those markers was confirmed by immuno-
staining (Figure 2H) and immunoblot (Figure 2I). One hun-
dred percent of cells in D6 EBs were ISL1 positive, whereas
90.3% ± 0.8% of cells were PAX2 positive (N = 3) (Fig-
ure 2H). Conversely, expression of marker genes for other
CE derivatives, such as ovarian mesenchymal stroma and
testicular interstitial cells (ABRACL) (Jameson et al., 2012)
and gonadal somatic cells (NR5A1) (Edson et al., 2009),
was not significantly different among D6 EBs, treated D8
EBs, and vehicle control D8 EBs (Figure 2J). Therefore, we
considered the D8 EBs to be a putative MD cell population.
Notably, H&E staining revealed a drastic change in cell
morphology during the transition from D6 to D8, such
that D6 EB cells were primarily ‘‘cobblestone’’ shaped,
epithelium-like cells, whereas the majority of cells in D8
EBs were spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like cells (Figure S2).
Differentiation of Mu
¨llerian Duct into EMSFs
Next, we cultured D8 EBs with 50-aza-20-deoxycytidine
(5aza2), CHIR, 17b-estradiol (E2), FGF9, and PDGF-BB for
6 days (Figure 3A). 5aza2 is a DNA methyltransferase inhib-
itor that induces pluripotent stem cell differentiation into
several cell types (Banerjee and Bacanamwo, 2010; Horrillo
et al., 2013). E2 at a moderate concentration (10�8 M) was
used to reproduce the levels present in the fetus (Peterson
et al., 1975), consistent with a previous protocol used to
differentiate human embryonic stem cell into cells of the
Mu
¨llerian lineage (Yu et al., 2015). FGF9 was added as a
known autocrine endometrial stromal growth factor (Tsai
et al., 2002), and PDGF-BB was used because it supports clo-
nogenicity of endometrial stromal cells (Chan et al., 2004).
After 6 days of treatment or (vehicle control treatment),
we examined whether the D14 EBs had committed to the
EMSF lineage based on positive expression of EMSF
markers. HOXA10 and HOXA11 are known to play critical

 roles in developmental patterning of the reproductive tract
(Benson et al., 1996; Gendron et al., 1997) and are also
necessary for endometrial receptivity (Du and Taylor,
2015). HOXA10 is expressed in the developing uterus (Du
and Taylor, 2015) but minimally expressed in fallopian
tube tissue (Salih and Taylor, 2004). In fact, the homeotic
transformation of the anterior part of the uterus into an
oviduct-like structure takes place in response to HOXA10
deficiency (Du and Taylor, 2015). HOXA11 is found in
the primordial lower uterus and cervix (Du and Taylor,
2015). MME is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein pre-
dominantly expressed in EMSFs (Imai et al., 1992), as is
PGR (Mote et al., 1999), which mediates progesterone
effects in the endometrium; PGR expression is low in the
vagina (Di Carlo et al., 1985). Expression levels of general
fibroblast markers, including COL1A1, FN1, and VIMs
were also examined (Akamatsu et al., 2013; Busch et al.,
2017; Cheng et al., 2016).
mRNA levels of HOXA10, HOXA11, PGR, COL1A1, FN1,
and VIM significantly increased in D14 EBs compared
with hiPSCs (Figure 3B), although expression of HOXA10,
HOXA11, COL1A1, and FN1 was comparable between
treated and vehicle control D14 EBs (Figure 3B). Protein
expression of MME, HOXA11, PGR, type I collagen, and
VIM was confirmed by immunostaining (Figure 3C) and
immunoblot (Figure 3D). One hundred percent of cells in
D14 EB were positive for MME and type I collagen, whereas
98.3% ± 1.0% of cells were HOXA11 positive. PGR was ex-
pressed in 94.3% ± 1.3% of cells (N = 3) (Figure 3C). With-
drawal of 5aza2 or E2 between D8 and D14 significantly
decreased the expression of EMX2 (Figure S1I), a gene
highly expressed in proliferative phase endometrium (Daf-
tary and Taylor, 2004).
Of note, mRNA expression of PGR in D14 EBs was compa-
rable with that in cultured primary EMSFs, although
expression of HOXA10, HOXA11, COL1A1, and VIM in pri-
mary EMSFs was significantly higher than that in D14 EBs
(Figure 3E). Our data suggested that primary EMSFs also ex-
press more FN1 compared with D14 EBs although there was
no statistically significant difference (p = 0.06). The cells in
D14 EBs were fibroblast-like cells, with no epithelial glan-
dular formation as shown by H&E staining (Figure S2).
Taken together, we considered these cells as an EMSF
population.
The transcript levels of SUSD2, which is a marker of endo-
metrial mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs), increases from
D4 to D8 (up to 10-fold), and decreases significantly from
D8 to D14 (Masuda et al., 2012). This supports the notion
that, during the differentiation protocol, these cells acquire
some of the eMSC properties at D8, followed by their differ-
entiation to EMSFs, as evident by a decline in SUSD2
expression (Figure S1J).
D14 EBs Undergo Decidualization in Response to
Hormonal Stimulation
During the secretory phase of the human menstrual cycle,
EMSFs undergo decidualization in response to hormonal
stimulation in preparation for implantation of an embryo
(Buzzio et al., 2006). The high levels of expression of PGR
in D14 EBs prompted us to further examine the hormone
responsiveness
of
D14
EBs
as
putative
EMSFs.
We
mimicked the secretory phase hormonal environment in
culture to stimulate in vitro decidualization (IVD) by treat-
ing D14 EBs with E2, progestin (MPA), and 8-bromoadeno-
sine 30,50-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) (Figure 4A). After
8 days of treatment, there was a significant increase in
the cytoplasmic volumes of treated cells, as demonstrated
by H&E staining at higher magnification (Figure 4B). Quan-
tification of cytoplasmic area demonstrated the significant
increase in the cytoplasmic volume in D22 EBs treated with
hormones (D22 IVD) compared with D22 EBs treated
with vehicle control (D22 VC) (266.2 ± 29.1 m2 versus
76.4 ± 4.2 m2, p < 0.05, respectively) (Figure S3A). Further-
more, D22 IVD expressed significantly higher mRNA levels

 of decidualization markers such as FOXO1, HAND2,
IGFBP1, and PRL (Buzzio et al., 2006) compared with D22
VC (Figure 4C). A similar profile was observed in two inde-
pendent clones although the upregulation of two of four
decidualization markers (IGFBP1 and PRL) observed in pri-
mary EMSFs were more prominent compared with D22 EBs
(Figures S3B and S3C). ELISA was used to confirm the pro-
tein levels of secreted IGFBP1 (Figure 4D). Immunoblot
and immunohistochemistry were used to confirm the pro-
tein expression of FOXO1 (Figures 4E and 4G). The levels of
PRLR, another marker of decidualization (Graubner et al.,
2017), was also increased in the D22 IVD versus D22 VC
by immunoblot (Figure 4E) and immunohistochemistry
(Figure 4G). Quantitative analysis of immunoblot densi-
tometry showed that the protein levels of FOXO1 and
PRLR were significantly higher in D22 IVD compared
with D22 VC (Figure 4F). The quantitative analysis of
immunohistochemistry revealed that the percentages of
FOXO1+ cells and PRLR+ cells were significantly higher
in D22 IVD compared with D22 VC (51.1% ± 4.2% versus
0%, p < 0.05; 54.2% ± 4.2% versus 0%, p < 0.05, respec-
tively) (Figure 4H). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of
FKBP5 (Su et al., 2012) and ZBTB16 (Kommagani et al.,
2016), which are direct PGR-target genes, was significantly
higher in D22 IVD compared with D22 VC (Figure 4I),
showing the progesterone responsiveness of the differenti-
ated cells.
To define a genetic signature of decidualization in the
differentiated D22 EBs, we performed RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq)
to
identify
differentially
expressed
genes
(DEGs) in D22 IVD relative to D22 VC. Pathway enrich-
ment analysis of the DEGs was performed using MetaCore.
The
differentially
regulated
pathways
for
the
DEGs
included the cAMP signaling pathway (false discovery
rate [FDR] <0.01) (Figure S4A), which is important for the
decidual transformation of EMSFs (Brar et al., 1997). See
Table S1 for the list of pathways with FDR values obtained
in the pathway enrichment analysis. We then compared
the D22 DEGs with those from our previously published
expression microarray analysis of primary human EMSFs
that underwent IVD treatment (Dyson et al., 2014). A total
of 1,404 DEGs were upregulated or downregulated simi-
larly in IVD-treated primary EMSFs and hiPSC-derived
D22 EMSFs (treated with IVD) compared with respective
vehicle controls (adjusted p < 0.05) (Figure S3D). Using
real-time PCR, we verified major decidualization markers
such as FOXO1, HAND2, IGFBP1, which were present
among commonly upregulated DEGs in both cell types,
supporting our hypothesis that iPSC-derived EMSFs are
molecularly quite similar to primary EMSFs (Buzzio et al.,
2006). Taken together, we confirmed the decidualization
capacity of D14 EBs, and characterized molecular similar-
ities between decidualization of primary EMSFs and iPSC-
derived EMSFs, also designated as D14 EBs.
D14 EBs Recapitulate the Molecular Signature of
Primary EMSFs
To assess the changes in molecular signatures that occur
during the differentiation of hiPSCs in our protocol and
how they compare with that in primary EMSFs, we
analyzed global gene expression profiles of EBs at each
stage (hiPSC, D2.5 EB, D4 EB, D6 EB, D8 EB, D14 EB,
D22 VC, and D22 IVD) and of primary EMSFs using
RNA-seq. The expression levels of 25,369 genes were
measured simultaneously. Unsupervised principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA) revealed a seamless transition in the
transcriptional profiles during differentiation (Figure 5A).
Unsupervised
hierarchical
clustering
analysis
showed
strong correlations between technical replicates in each
group and that the D14 EB and D22 EB signatures cluster
more closely to primary EMSFs, confirming their resem-
blance to EMSFs (Figure 5B). Clustered heatmap analysis
of 1,434 transcription factor genes revealed greater similar-
ity between the transcriptomes of primary EMSFs and D14
EBs compared with hiPSCs (Figure 5C). See Table S2 for the
list of genes used in Figure 5C.

A total of 11,241 and 10,299 DEGs were identified in D14 EBs and primary EMSFs, respectively, compared with hiPSCs (N = 3 independent
experiments, FDR adjusted p value <0.05). Since D14 EBs and primary EMSFs share 7,438 DEGs regardless of the direction of the expression,

 To identify the genes that drive the induction of EMSFs
from hiPSCs, we sought common DEGs in primary EMSFs
and D14 EBs relative to hiPSCs. A total of 11,241 and
10,299 DEGs were identified in D14 EBs and primary
EMSFs, respectively, compared with hiPSCs (adjusted
p < 0.05). Since D14 EBs and primary EMSFs share 7,438
DEGs regardless of the direction of expression, 14,102
(= 11,241 + 10,299 – 7,438) different sets of genes were
used to perform downstream analyses. A total of 6,366
DEGs were similarly upregulated or downregulated in pri-
mary EMSFs and D14 EBs compared with hiPSCs (adjusted
p < 0.05), as demonstrated by the Venn diagram in Fig-
ure 5D. Thirty genes (15 upregulated and 15 downregu-
lated genes in D14 and primary EMSFs compared with
hiPSCs) with the highest fold changes are listed in the clus-
tered heatmap (Figure S5A). The top 15 downregulated
DEGs include pluripotency markers such as SOX2 and
NANOG, whereas the top 15 upregulated genes include
genes that play crucial roles in endometrial function,
such as WNT2, GBP1, and POSTN (Burmenskaya et al.,
2017; Kumar et al., 2001; Li et al., 2017). Endometrium-spe-
cific transcription factors (HOXA9, HOXA10, HOXA11, and
PGR) and EMSF markers (MME, COL1A1, FN1, and VIM)
were present among other common DEGs. Pathway
enrichment analysis by MetaCore comparing a total of
14,102 genes included in DEGs in primary EMSFs and
D14 EBs relative to hiPSCs showed common enrichment
for genes in the cell-cycle regulation pathway (FDR <0.01)
and EMT pathway involving transforming growth factor
(TGF) and WNT/CTNNB1 pathways (FDR <0.01), indi-
cating that similar pathways are active in primary EMSFs
and D14 EBs (Figures 5E and S4B). See Table S3 for the list
of pathways with FDR values obtained in the pathway
enrichment analysis. Gene ontology (GO) analysis using
the same gene list showed common enrichment for
‘‘cellular component organization’’ and ‘‘system develop-
ment’’ (Figure S5B). See Table S4 for the list of pathways
with FDR values obtained in the pathway enrichment anal-
ysis. Heatmap analysis based on 133 genes involved in cell-
cycle regulation revealed significant similarities between
primary EMSFs and D14 EBs compared with hiPSCs (Fig-
ure S5C), confirming the result of the pathway enrichment
analysis. By contrast, the similarity between primary EMSFs
and D14 EBs was relatively weak with regard to the cyto-
skeleton remodeling pathway or EMT pathway as shown
by heatmap analysis of 232 genes involved in these two
pathways (Figure S5D). See Table S2 for the list of genes
used in Figures S5C and S5D.
To examine the similarity between D14 EBs and eMSCs,
we sorted SUSD2-positive eMSCs from freshly isolated pri-
mary EMSFs using flow cytometry, and performed RNA-
seq. The percentage of SUSD2+ eMSCs among primary
EMSFs was 3.6% ± 1.5% (N = 3) (Figure 6A). The mRNA
expression of SUSD2 was significantly higher in the
SUSD2-positive population compared with the SUSD2-
negative population (Figure 6B), showing the efficient
isolation of SUSD2-positive eMSCs. We then performed
RNA-seq on the SUSD2-positive population, and compared
its global gene expression profile with D14 and primary
EMSFs.
Unsupervised
hierarchical
clustering
analysis
revealed greater similarity between the transcriptomes of
primary EMSFs and D14 EBs compared with eMSCs (Fig-
ure 6C). These results collectively suggest the proximity
of D14 EBs to primary EMSFs, but not eMSCs.
The WNT/CTNNB1 Pathway Is Required for Induction
of EMSFs from hiPSCs
Based on the critical effect of CHIR, a CTNNB1 pathway
agonist for EMSF induction from hiPSCs in our previous ex-
periments, we hypothesized that the canonical CTNNB1
signaling pathway may play a key role in the differentia-
tion of hiPSCs to EMSFs. Indeed, pathway enrichment
analysis showed greater similarity of gene expression in
the WNT signaling pathway between primary EMSFs and
D14 EBs relative to hiPSCs (Figures 5E and S3B). Since acti-
vation of the canonical WNT/CTNNB1 signaling pathway
results in the accumulation of CTNNB1 in the nucleus
(Nusse, 2005), we performed immunofluorescence of
CTNNB1 to determine its cellular localization in EBs.
Progressive translocation of CTNNB1 from the plasma
membrane to the nucleus was observed at each EB differen-
tiation stage, confirming the activation of the canonical
CTNNB1 pathway (Figures 7A and S6).
To determine whether the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway is
required for differentiation of hiPSCs to EMSFs, we main-
tained cultures of D4 EBs (IM-like stage), D6 EBs (CE-like
stage), and D8 EBs (MD-like stage) in the absence of CHIR
or in the presence of CHIR plus or minus CTNNB1 inhibi-
tors until D6 (CE-like stage), D8 (MD-like stage), and D14
(EMSF-like stage), respectively. Two types of CTNNB1 in-
hibitors were used. IWP2, an inhibitor of Porcn, was used
to
block
the
autocrine
secretion
of
WNT
proteins.
XAV939 is a Tankyrase inhibitor that stimulates CTNNB1
degradation. We then examined the effects of treatment
on expression of PGR, HOXA10, and HOXA 11. Interest-
ingly, withholding CHIR or the addition of CTNNB1
pathway inhibitors (to the regular CHIR-containing cock-
tail) significantly decreased the expression of PGR at every
EB stage (Figures 7B–7D), indicating the importance of
WNT/CTNNB1 signaling for PGR expression at every stage
of differentiation of hiPSCs. In contrast, while withholding
CHIR or the addition of CTNNB1 pathway inhibitors be-
tween D4 and D6 significantly decreased the expression
of HOXA10 and HOXA11 (Figure 7B), CHIR withdrawal
between D6 and D8 had no effect on HOXA gene expres-
sion levels (Figure 7C). Furthermore, withholding CHIR

 or CTNNB1 inhibition between D8 and D14 increased the
expression of HOXA10 and HOXA11 (Figure 7D). These
data suggest that, while the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway is
necessary during all stages of endometrial differentiation,
it serves diverse functions and seems to be essential for pro-
gesterone responsiveness.
DISCUSSION
We defined a protocol to induce the differentiation of
EMSFs from hiPSCs under molecularly delineated EB cul-
ture conditions. Although the differentiation of human
embryonic stem cells and/or hiPSCs to cardiac, hepatic,
pancreatic, kidney, or neuronal cell lineages has been
widely reported (Batchelder et al., 2009; Chambers et al.,
2009; Mae et al., 2013; Song et al., 2009; Zhang et al.,
2009a, 2009b), our study represents a demonstration of
the successful production of endometrial lineage cells
from hiPSCs.
Only a few previous studies have attempted to derive
cells of endometrial cell lineage from human embryonic
stem cells (Song et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2011; Yu et al.,
2015). Ye and colleagues induced mesoderm from a human
embryonic stem cell line, co-cultured the mesoderm with
murine neonatal endometrial cells, and then transplanted
the differentiated cells under the kidney capsule of immu-
nodeficient mice. In the graft, they found epithelium with
TUBB (tubulin beta)-positive cilia, which expressed female
reproductive tract epithelium markers CK18, CA125, ESR1,
and HOXA10 (Ye et al., 2011). Yu and colleagues also
demonstrated induction of an endometrium-like cell pop-
ulation, which expressed significantly higher PRL after
treating a human embryonic stem cell line with a combina-
tion of PDGF-BB and WNT5a (Yu et al., 2015). Song et al.
(2015) reported differentiation of a human embryonic
stem cell line into endometrium-like cells expressing
several endometrial markers, using conditioned media
from human EMSFs. Of these three previous papers, only
Ye et al. (2011) reported the expression of Mu
¨llerian duct
cell
markers
during
differentiation
from
mesoderm,
whereas changes in gene profiles during the differentiation
of the human embryonic stem cells in the studies by Yu
et al. (2015) and Song et al. (2015) are not clear. While Yu
et al. (2015) did demonstrate possible hormone receptivity
of the differentiated endometrium-like cells, since human
dermal fibroblast cells also express PRL after IVD (Richards
and Hartman, 1996), they were unable to distinguish
‘‘endometrium-like cells’’ from dermal fibroblast cells.
The published protocols to produce Mu
¨llerian duct cells
from human embryonic stem cells have several limitations.
First, these protocols used poorly defined components,
such as conditioned medium obtained from endometrial
cell culture (Song et al., 2015) and co-culture with endome-
trium obtained from newborn mice (Ye et al., 2011), which
would not be suitable for clinical applications. Second,
since human embryonic stem cells are established from
the inner cell mass of an embryo, the tissues derived from
these cells cannot be transplanted to patients without an
immune rejection.
Although hiPSCs are more difficult to differentiate than
human embryonic stem cells (Kuzmenkin et al., 2009),
hiPSCs present fewer ethical problems than human embry-
onic stem cells and are able to produce histocompatible tis-
sues for autologous transplantation (Kondo et al., 2017).
Thus, hiPSC research is expected to lead to regenerative
therapies for various disorders, possibly including uterine
factor infertility and endometriosis.
Here, we attempted to reproduce each stage of EMSF
development, confirming the lineage of the differentiated
cells at each step based on the presence and absence of
cell-specific marker genes. We used an established protocol
for the first step, IM induction, using a previously estab-
lished protocol from Lam et al. (2014). We detected robust
upregulation of LHX1 and PAX2 via PS differentiation us-
ing sequential treatment with CHIR, FGF2, and RA, consis-
tent with the findings of Lam et al. (2014). We then used a
WNT/CTNNB1 pathway agonist along with other chemical
cocktails following the published findings that suggest a
critical role of the WNT/CTNNB1 pathway in the differen-
tiation of Mu
¨llerian tissues (Deutscher and Hung-Chang
Yao, 2007; Stewart et al., 2013). With each step, our proto-
col produced EBs with gene expression profiles similar to
CE, MD, and endometrial cells.
Importantly, we also demonstrated that the transcrip-
tomes of the hiPSC-derived EMSFs and primary EMSFs
were similar in the hierarchical analysis and heatmap anal-
ysis. Temporal changes in transcription factor genes are
critical for development, as they turn on or off the appro-
priate genes in response to various growth factors to
regulate changes in cell morphology and function that
determine cell fate and differentiation (Lobe, 1992). For
example, the HOX transcription factor family is important
for proper body pattern formation (Moens and Selleri,
2006). A characteristic spatial distribution of HOXA9-13
is seen throughout the MD of vertebrates (Goodman,
2002). HOXA9 is expressed in the oviduct, HOXA10 is ex-
pressed in the uterus, HOXA11 is found in the lower uterus
and cervix, and HOXA13 is seen in the ectocervix and up-
per vagina (Du and Taylor, 2015). Interestingly, HOXA9,
10, and 11, but not 13, were similarly regulated in D14
EBs and EMSFs, but distinct from hiPSCs.
The PCA partly supported the similarity of hiPSC-derived
EMSFs and primary EMSFs: on the PC1 axis, the transcrip-
tome distance between primary EMSFs and EBs became
progressively closer during the differentiation process. To
1150
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 11 j 1136–1155 j November 13, 2018
 assess the gene signature that drives the induction of
EMSFs, we identified 30 common DEGs with the highest
fold changes in D14 and primary EMSFs relative to hiPSCs.
Although the PCA was generated from the whole transcrip-
tome, it is inferable that these DEGs significantly contrib-
uted to the transition observed in PCA.
Pathway enrichment analysis further revealed that
EMSFs and D14 EBs show common enrichment for genes
in the cell-cycle regulation pathway, EMT pathway, and
cytoskeleton remodeling pathway that involves TGF and
WNT, relative to hiPSCs. However, while a heatmap of
cell-cycle regulation gene expression clearly demonstrated
the similarity between D14 EBs and primary EMSFs, a heat-
map of EMT pathway and cytoskeleton pathway genes
showed only weak similarity between D14 EBs and primary
EMSFs. This discrepancy between pathway enrichment
analysis and heatmap gene expression may be explained
by the difference in fold change between primary EMSFs
and D14 EBs relative to hiPSCs, as pathway enrichment
analysis only relies on the direction of gene regulation
(i.e., upregulation or downregulation).
Hormone responsiveness is a defining characteristic of
the endometrial stroma. In the secretory phase of the hu-
man menstrual cycle, progesterone exerts its action on
EMSFs by binding to PGR, a member of the steroid hor-
mone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcrip-
tion factors, promoting differentiation of the cells in a
process termed decidualization (Gellersen and Brosens,
2003). When hiPSC-derived EBs were treated with estro-
gen, progestin, and a cAMP analog, they underwent
decidualization, and the resulting D22 EBs had a similar
transcriptome
expression
pattern
as
primary
EMSFs,
with approximately 20%–30% of all DEGs similarly up-
or downregulated in response to IVD treatment. The
upregulation of direct PGR-target genes in response to the
hormone treatment further supported the active PGR
signaling pathway in the differentiated cells.
Our method of using CHIR to induce differentiation into
Mu
¨llerian lineage is consistent with the important role of
WNT/CTNNB1 signaling during embryonic MD develop-
ment (Deutscher and Hung-Chang Yao, 2007; Stewart
et al., 2013). Indeed, the addition of CTNNB1 inhibitors
led to downregulation of PGR, suggesting a critical relation-
ship between the canonical WNT/CTNNB1 signaling
pathway and PGR expression, at least in the developing
MD. Further study is needed to clarify the interaction be-
tween these signaling cascades.
hiPSC-derived EMSFs cultured as EBs displayed many spe-
cific characteristics of primary EMSFs such as expression
of the
critical genes including PGR, HOXA11,
PRL,
and IGFBP1. There were, however, some quantitative
differences between the two cell types. For example, proges-
terone fold induction of PRL or IGFBP1 was lower in hiPSC-
derived EMSFs. Moreover, the expression levels of general
fibroblast markers such as VIM were lower in hiPSC-derived
EMSFs compared with primary EMSFs. We anticipate that
further optimization of the current protocol and experi-
mental model will improve these aspects in the future.
Further study is also needed to generate endometrial
epithelial cells from hiPSCs. Whereas EMSFs are relatively
easy to grow on a 2D culture dish, endometrial epithelial
cells are more difficult to maintain. Recently, Turco et al.
(2017) reported a method for long-term, hormone-respon-
sive organoid culture of human endometrium in a chemi-
cally defined medium. Their approach may help elucidate
the distinct physiology of endometrial epithelial cells and
lead to a new protocol to generate endometrial epithelial
cells from hiPSCs in the future.
With regard to the potential clinical applications of our
work, we envision that the protocol to differentiate EMSFs
from hiPSCs will one day be amenable to cell replacement
therapy for endometrial diseases such as endometriosis or
early-stage
low-grade
endometrial
cancer,
in
which
abnormal EMSFs contribute to pathogenesis (Janzen et al.,
2013; Kim et al., 2013). Cell replacement therapy may also
be effective for the treatment of uterine factor infertility,
such as Asherman syndrome (intrauterine adhesions).
Future studies will explore the use of natural or synthetic
scaffolds of differentiated iPSC-derived EMSFs for transplan-
tation. In fact, endometrium-like tissues were successfully
regenerated from decellularized rat uterine matrix reseeded
with rat uterine cells (Miyazaki and Maruyama, 2014). This
technology may become a component of a novel therapeu-
tic strategy for treating uterine agenesis. Also, further work is
needed to elucidate the precise molecular pathways within
the WNT/CTNNB1 signaling cascade for the regulation of
PGR during differentiation of stem cells, which can lead to
a novel molecular therapy for a variety of endometrial dis-
eases since abnormal responses to progesterone play key
roles in the pathogenesis of such disorders.
In conclusion, defined sequential incubation with a
CTNNB1 activator and a number of other specific hor-
mones induces differentiation of hiPSCs into EBs with
similar gene expression patterns as EMSFs; these cells are
capable of decidualization in response to a time-honored
hormonal stimulation. We also demonstrated that the ca-
nonical CTNNB1 signaling pathway is essential for the
expression of PGR, the key steroid hormone receptor and
master regulator of the most important function of the
endometrium, i.e., implantation of an embryo (Kim et al.,
2013). The establishment of a protocol for differentiating
hiPSCs into cells of the endometrial stromal cell lineage
will have implications for cell-based therapies and bioengi-
neering of endometrial tissue for the treatment of various
endometrial diseases such as endometriosis, early-stage
endometrial cancer, and uterine factor infertility.

Experimental Model and Subject Details
Ethics Statement
The acquisition of human tissue for this study was approved by the
Northwestern Institutional Review Board for Human Research
(1375–005). Written informed consent from each subject was ob-
tained before surgery.
Method Details
hiPSC Culture
Two hiPSC lines (clone 1, ACS-1028; clone 2, ACS-1030) were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA). Clones 1 and 2 were derived from bone marrow CD34+ cells
obtained from a healthy African American female donor and a
white female donor, respectively, with Sendai viral expression
of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC genes. The cells were routinely
cultured on feeder layers of mitomycin C-treated mouse embry-
onic fibroblast feeder cells (Applied StemCells, Milpitas, CA),
seeded on gelatin-coated dishes (MilliporeSigma, Burlington,
MA),
in

+
20%
KnockOut Serum Replacement + 1 mM nonessential amino
acids + 2 mM GlutaMAX + 0.55 mM 2-mercaptoethanol [all
from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA]) supplemented
with 10 ng/mL recombinant human FGF2 (PeproTech, Rocky
Hill, NJ) (passages 9–13). Cell plastics were from TPP (St. Louis,
MO). Cultures were passaged using calcium-/magnesium-free
PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 0.5 mM
EDTA (VWR, Radnor, PA) and 30.8 mM NaCl (MilliporeSigma)
at a 1:4 split ratio every 3–5 days.
