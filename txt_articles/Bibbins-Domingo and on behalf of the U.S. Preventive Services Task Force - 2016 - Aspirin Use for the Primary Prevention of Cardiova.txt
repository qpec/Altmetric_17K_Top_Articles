 Aspirin Use for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease
and Colorectal Cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
Recommendation Statement
Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, PhD, MD, MAS, on behalf of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force*
Description: Update of the 2009 USPSTF recommendation on
aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and
the 2007 recommendation on aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug use to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC).
Methods: The USPSTF reviewed 5 additional studies of aspirin
for the primary prevention of CVD and several additional analy-
ses of CRC follow-up data. The USPSTF also relied on commis-
sioned systematic reviews of all-cause mortality and total cancer
incidence and mortality and a comprehensive review of harms.
The USPSTF then used a microsimulation model to systemati-
cally estimate the balance of benefits and harms.
Population: This recommendation applies to adults aged 40
years or older without known CVD and without increased bleed-
ing risk.
Recommendations: The USPSTF recommends initiating low-
dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in
adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year
CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life ex-
pectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose
aspirin daily for at least 10 years. (B recommendation)
The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary
prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 60 to 69 years who
have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual
one. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a
life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-
dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years are more likely to benefit.
Persons who place a higher value on the potential benefits than
the potential harms may choose to initiate low-dose aspirin. (C
recommendation)
The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of
benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary pre-
vention of CVD and CRC in adults younger than 50 years. (I
statement)
The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of
benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary pre-
vention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 70 years or older. (I
statement)

T
he U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
makes recommendations about the effectiveness of
specific preventive care services for patients without ob-
vious related signs or symptoms.
It bases its recommendations on the evidence of
both the benefits and harms of the service and an as-
sessment of the balance. The USPSTF does not consider
the costs of providing a service in this assessment.
The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions in-
volve more considerations than evidence alone. Clini-
cians should understand the evidence but individualize
decision making to the specific patient or situation. Sim-
ilarly, the USPSTF notes that policy and coverage deci-
sions involve considerations in addition to the evidence
of clinical benefits and harms.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND
EVIDENCE
The USPSTF recommends initiating low-dose aspi-
rin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) in adults aged
50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD
risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life
expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to
take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years. (B
recommendation)
The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the
primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 60
to 69 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk
should be an individual one. Persons who are not at
increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at
least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin

RATIONALE
Importance
Cardiovascular disease and CRC are major causes
of death among U.S. adults. In 2011, more than one
half of all deaths in the United States were caused by
heart disease, cancer, or stroke (1, 2).
Recognition of Risk Status
The primary risk factors for CVD include older age,
male sex, race/ethnicity, abnormal lipid levels, high
blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking (2).
The USPSTF used a calculator derived from the
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Asso-
ciation (ACC/AHA) pooled cohort equations to predict
10-year risk for first hard atherosclerotic CVD event (de-
fined as nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], coronary
heart disease [CHD] death, and fatal or nonfatal stroke)
(3). Although concerns have been raised about the
equations' potential to overpredict risk and their mod-
erate discrimination, they are the only U.S.-based, ex-
Figure. Aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer: clinical summary.

Risk Assessment
Primary risk factors for CVD are older age, male sex, race/ethnicity, abnormal lipid levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and 
smoking. Risk factors for GI bleeding with aspirin use include higher aspirin dose and longer duration of use, history of GI ulcers or 
upper GI pain, bleeding disorders, renal failure, severe liver disease, and thrombocytopenia.
The USPSTF used a calculator derived from the ACC/AHA pooled cohort equations to predict 10-y risk for first atherosclerotic CVD 
event.
Preventive 
Medication
Aspirin’s anticlotting effect is useful for primary and secondary CVD prevention because it potentially decreases the accumulation of 
blood clots that form as a result of reduced blood flow at atherosclerotic plaques, thereby reducing hypoxic damage to heart and 
brain tissue. The mechanisms for inhibition of adenoma or colorectal cancer development are not yet well-understood but may result  
from aspirin’s anti-inflammatory properties.
Treatment and 
Dosage
A reasonable approach consistent with the evidence is to prescribe 81 mg/d (the most commonly prescribed dose in the United  
States), and assess CVD and bleeding risk factors starting at age 50 y and periodically thereafter, as well as when CVD and   
bleeding risk factors are first detected or change.
Balance of Benefits 
and Harms

outweigh the increased risk for
bleeding by a moderate 
amount.

 ternally validated equations that report risk as a combi-
nation of cerebrovascular and CHD events.
Risk factors for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding with
aspirin use include higher dose and longer duration of
use, history of GI ulcers or upper GI pain, bleeding dis-
orders, renal failure, severe liver disease, and thrombo-
cytopenia. Other factors that increase risk for GI or
intracranial bleeding with low-dose aspirin use in-
clude concurrent anticoagulation or nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, uncontrolled hyperten-
sion, male sex, and older age (4, 5).
This recommendation applies to adults who are at
increased CVD risk and at average risk for CRC. Per-
sons who are at increased CVD risk and are known to
be at increased risk for CRC (for example, persons with
a family or personal history of CRC or familial adeno-
matous polyposis) (6) should consult their health care
provider.
Benefits of Aspirin Use
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that aspirin
use to reduce risk for cardiovascular events (nonfatal MI
and stroke) in adults aged 50 to 69 years who are at
increased CVD risk is of moderate benefit. The magni-
tude of benefit varies by age and 10-year CVD risk.
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that aspirin
use reduces the incidence of CRC in adults after 5 to 10
years of use.
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence that aspi-
rin use reduces risk for CVD events in adults who are at
increased CVD risk and are younger than 50 years or
older than 69 years.
Harms of Aspirin Use
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that aspirin
use in adults increases the risk for GI bleeding and
hemorrhagic stroke. The USPSTF determined that the
harms vary but are small in adults aged 59 years or
younger and small to moderate in adults aged 60 to 69
years. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to de-
termine the harms of aspirin use in adults aged 70
years or older.
USPSTF Assessment
In adults aged 50 to 69 years who are at increased
CVD risk, the benefits of aspirin use include prevention
of MI and ischemic stroke and, with long-term use, re-
duced incidence of CRC. Aspirin use may also result in
small to moderate harms, including GI bleeding and
hemorrhagic stroke.
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty
that the benefit of aspirin use for the primary preven-
tion of CVD events, combined with the reduced inci-
dence of CRC, outweighs the increased risk for bleed-
ing by a moderate amount in adults aged 50 to 59
years who have a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater.
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty
that the benefit of aspirin use for the primary preven-
tion of CVD events, combined with the reduced inci-
dence of CRC, outweighs the increased risk for bleed-
ing by a small amount in adults aged 60 to 69 years
who have a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater.
The USPSTF concludes that the evidence on aspirin
use in adults younger than 50 years or older than 69
years is insufficient and the balance of benefits and
harms cannot be determined.
CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Patient Population Under Consideration
This recommendation applies to adults aged 40
years or older without known CVD (including history of
MI or stroke) and without increased bleeding risk (for
example, history of GI ulcers, recent bleeding, or use of
medications that increase bleeding risk).
Assessment of the Balance of Benefits and
Harms
The magnitude of the health benefits of aspirin use
depends on an individual's baseline CVD risk and will-
ingness to take aspirin for a sufficient duration to obtain
the benefit of reduced incidence of CRC. The magni-
tude of harms depends on the presence of risk factors
for bleeding.
Baseline CVD Risk
The magnitude of the cardiovascular risk reduction
with aspirin use depends on an individual's initial risk
for CVD events. Risk assessment for CVD should in-
clude ascertainment of the following risk factors: age,
sex, race/ethnicity, total cholesterol level, high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure,
hypertension treatment, diabetes, and smoking. An on-
line version of the ACC/AHA risk calculator can be
found at http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/.
CRC Prevention
Colorectal cancer prevention plays an important
role in the overall health benefit of aspirin, but this ben-
efit is not apparent until 10 years after aspirin therapy is
started. Patients need to take aspirin for at least 5 to 10
years to realize this potential benefit (6, 7), and persons
with shorter life expectancy are less likely to benefit.
Thus, aspirin use is more likely to have an effect when it
is started between the ages of 50 and 59 years. Be-
cause of the time required before a reduced incidence
in CRC is seen, older persons (that is, 60 years or older)
are less likely to realize this benefit than adults aged 50
to 59 years (8).
GI and Intracranial Bleeding
Evidence shows that risk for GI bleeding, with and
without aspirin use, increases with age. For this recom-
mendation, the USPSTF considered older age and
male sex to be important risk factors for GI bleeding.
Other risk factors include upper GI tract pain, GI
ulcers, concurrent anticoagulation or NSAID use, and
uncontrolled hypertension (4, 5). Nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug therapy combined with aspirin use
increases the risk for serious GI bleeding compared
with aspirin use alone (9). The rate of serious bleeding

 among aspirin users is about 2 to 3 times greater in
patients with a history of GI ulcer (10). The risk for seri-
ous GI bleeding is 2 times greater in men than in
women (10). These risk factors substantially increase
the risk for bleeding and should be considered in the
overall decision about whether to start or continue as-
pirin therapy. There is no evidence that enteric-coated
or buffered formulations reduce the risk for serious GI
bleeding (2, 4, 11).
Balance of Benefits and Harms
The USPSTF used a CVD microsimulation model to
estimate cardiovascular event rates based on baseline
risk factors and aspirin use. It used the AHA/ACC risk
calculator to stratify findings of benefits and harms by
10-year CVD risk. The USPSTF also calculated estimates
of CRC incidence and harms of bleeding to determine
the net balance of benefits and harms across individu-
als with varying baseline CVD risk (8, 12).
The Table presents the USPSTF's estimated lifetime
number of nonfatal MIs, ischemic strokes, and cases of
CRC prevented, stratified by 10-year CVD risk level,
age, and sex, among adults aged 50 to 69 years (the
age range with evidence of net benefit from aspirin
use). In addition, the Table presents the USPSTF's esti-
mated lifetime number of GI bleeding events and hem-
orrhagic strokes. The USPSTF developed these esti-
mates assuming that aspirin users are not taking
NSAIDs and do not have other conditions that increase
risk for GI bleeding. The USPSTF estimated life-years
and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved as one
part of its consideration of the balance of benefits and
harms of these disparate clinical outcomes (see the Im-
plementation section for more information on interpret-
ing the results in the Table).
Overall, the USPSTF determined that the greatest
net benefit to be gained is by adults aged 50 to 59
years whose 10-year CVD risk is 10% or greater. The
USPSTF recommends that persons in this age and risk
group start taking aspirin. Adults aged 60 to 69 years
may also benefit from starting aspirin use, although the
net benefit is smaller due to the increased risk for GI
bleeding and decreased benefit in CRC prevention in
this age group (8).
Further, the decision about the level of CVD risk at
which the potential benefits outweigh potential harms
is an individual one. Some adults may decide that
avoiding an MI or a stroke is very important and that
having a GI bleeding event is not as significant. They
may decide to take aspirin at a lower CVD risk level
than those who are more concerned about GI bleed-
ing. Adults who have a high likelihood of benefit with
little potential for harm should be encouraged to con-
sider aspirin use. Conversely, adults who have little po-
tential for benefit or are at high risk for GI bleeding
should be discouraged from it.
Treatment and Dosage
The optimal dose of aspirin to prevent CVD events
is not known. Primary prevention trials have demon-
strated benefits with various regimens, including doses
of 75 and 100 mg per day and 100 and 325 mg every
other day. A dose of 75 mg per day seems as effective
as higher doses. The risk for GI bleeding may increase
with the dosage. A pragmatic approach consistent with
the evidence is to prescribe 81 mg per day, which is the
most commonly prescribed dose in the United States.
Although the optimal timing and frequency of dis-
cussions about aspirin therapy are unknown, a reason-
able approach may be to assess CVD and bleeding risk
factors starting at age 50 years and periodically there-
after, as well as when CVD and bleeding risk factors are
first detected or change.

 Suggestions for Practice Regarding the
I Statements
Potential Preventable Burden
Evidence from primary prevention trials on the
benefits of initiating aspirin use in adults younger than
50 years is limited. The potential benefit is probably
lower than in adults aged 50 to 69 years because the
risk for CVD events is lower (only a small percentage of
adults younger than 50 years have a 10-year CVD risk
≥10%) (8). Adults younger than 50 years who have an
increased 10-year CVD risk may gain significant benefit
from aspirin use; how much benefit is uncertain.
Evidence on the benefits and harms of initiating
aspirin use in older adults is limited. Many adults aged
70 years or older are at increased risk for CVD because
of their age. They have a high incidence of MI and
stroke; thus, the potential benefit of aspirin could be
substantial.
Potential Harms
The relationship between older age and GI bleed-
ing is well-established; thus, the potential harms for
adults older than 70 years are significant. The complex-
ity of risk factors, medication use, and concomitant ill-
ness make it difficult to assess the balance of benefits
and harms of initiating aspirin use in this age group. In
addition, aspirin use in adults older than 70 years re-
sults in smaller reductions in the incidence of CRC com-
pared with younger adults.
Current Practice
Nearly 40% of U.S. adults older than 50 years use
aspirin for the primary or secondary prevention of CVD
(5). A study of National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey data assessed how common aspirin use is
for the primary prevention of CVD and whether physi-
cians recommend it or patients start it on their own.
Among patients who were eligible for aspirin therapy
and
were
at
increased
CHD
risk
(>10%
10-year
risk), about 41% were told by a physician to take aspi-
rin. Among patients aged 65 years or older who were
told by a physician to take aspirin, 80% adhered to the
recommendation (13).
Useful Resources
The USPSTF has made other recommendations on
CVD prevention, including smoking cessation and pro-
moting a healthful diet and physical activity, as well as
screening for carotid artery stenosis, CHD, high blood
pressure,
lipid
disorders,
obesity,
diabetes,
and
peripheral artery disease. In addition, it has made rec-
ommendations on screening for CRC. These recom-
mendations are available on the USPSTF Web site
(www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org).
Additional Approaches to Prevention
Million Hearts (millionhearts.hhs.gov) is a national
initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes
by 2017. It aims to prevent heart disease and stroke by
improving access to effective care, improving the qual-
ity of care for the “ABCS” (aspirin when appropriate,
blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and
smoking cessation), focusing clinical attention on the
prevention of heart attack and stroke, and activating
the public to lead a heart-healthy lifestyle.
The Community Preventive Services Task Force
recommends several intervention strategies to prevent
CVD for communities and health care organizations
(available at www.thecommunityguide.org/cvd/). For
health care systems, it recommends introducing clinical
decision-support systems to implement clinical guide-
lines at the point of care. For insurers and payers, it
recommends reducing out-of-pocket costs to patients
for medications to control high blood pressure and
high cholesterol. For clinicians and health care organi-
zations, it recommends incorporating multidisciplinary
team-based care to improve blood pressure control,
including patients, primary care providers, and other
professionals (such as nurses, pharmacists, dietitians,
social workers, and community health workers).
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
Implementation
The decision to start or continue taking aspirin to
prevent CVD and CRC is complex, with many important
factors for clinicians and patients to consider. The most
favorable balance of benefits and harms involves ben-
efit for both CVD and CRC prevention and little poten-
tial for harm from bleeding. Persons who either are at
low risk for CVD events or have a life expectancy too
short to benefit from a reduced risk for CRC will receive
significantly less benefit; thus, the balance of benefits
and harms will likely not be favorable.
The balance of benefits and harms of aspirin use is
contingent on 4 main factors: risk for bleeding, prefer-
ences about taking aspirin, baseline CVD risk, and age.
• Risk for bleeding: Aspirin use is likely to do more
harm than good in persons who are at increased risk
for GI or intracranial bleeding.
• Preferences about taking aspirin: Persons who
place a high value on avoiding long-term daily medica-
tion use are poor candidates for aspirin use.
• Baseline CVD risk: A CVD risk threshold of 10%
should prompt a discussion about aspirin use. Persons
who are at higher risk will benefit more from aspirin use
than those who are near the 10% threshold. Although
persons who are at lower risk may still receive benefit,
they are less likely to have a favorable balance of ben-
efits and harms.
• Age 50 to 59 years: Initiating aspirin in this age
group has the largest average net benefit (Table). A
CVD risk threshold of 10% will identify patients for
whom the benefits outweigh the harms, provided they
are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to
take long-term daily medication. In addition, persons in
this age range generally have sufficient life expectancy
to benefit from a reduced risk for CRC.
• Age 60 to 69 years: Adults in this age group with
a higher CVD risk are most likely to have a favorable
balance of benefits and harms, and younger adults are
more likely to benefit from a reduced risk for CRC.

 Adults aged 60 to 69 years who are already taking as-
pirin as recommended by their clinician should con-
tinue use unless they develop new risk factors for
bleeding. Adults who develop CVD should use aspirin,
as directed by their clinician, to prevent future CVD
events.
• Age 70 years or older: The USPSTF was unable to
assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating
aspirin use in this age group. Adults aged 70 years or
older who are currently taking aspirin should discuss
with their clinician whether they should continue.
The time to benefit for CRC (that is, reduced CRC
incidence and death) and time to harm are important
considerations in assessing the benefits and harms of
initiating aspirin use in older adults. The CVD preven-
tion benefit begins within the first 5 years of use and
continues as long as aspirin is used. The CRC preven-
tion benefit is more complex. It takes at least 5 to 10
years of daily aspirin use to obtain a CRC benefit; how-
ever, due to a longer latent period, the benefit may
take 10 to 20 years to appear. Therefore, older adults
and those with shorter remaining life expectancy may
receive less benefit. Meanwhile, bleeding harms may
occur in the short term.
The Table provides information to help clinicians
understand the balance of benefits and harms of aspi-
rin therapy, especially for adults in their 60s. The mag-
nitude of net benefit is smaller at lower 10-year CVD
risk levels and greater at higher levels. For both men
and women, CRC benefits tend to be lower at higher
CVD risk levels due to competing causes of mortality,
including death from CVD.
Research Needs and Gaps
There are many important research gaps that, if
filled, could identify populations that may benefit the
most from using aspirin to prevent CVD and CRC. Car-
diovascular disease prevention in subpopulations is a
significant evidence gap. No data exist on the role of
aspirin therapy in racial/ethnic groups. Additional evi-
dence on benefits and harms in persons younger than
50 years or 70 years or older would help clarify who
could potentially benefit from aspirin use. An updated
version of the individual-patient data meta-analysis
from the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration that ac-
counts for confounders would be helpful in under-
standing the effect of aspirin in subpopulations.
More information is needed to determine the inter-
actions between statins and aspirin. How the use of
proton-pump inhibitors with aspirin may change the
balance of benefits and harms should be better under-
stood. In addition, more information is needed to dif-
ferentiate between aspirin's effect in reducing risk for
ischemic stroke and increasing risk for hemorrhagic
stroke.
The effect of aspirin use on CRC prevention in sub-
populations is also an important research gap. The dif-
ferential effects of sex, race/ethnicity, age, and genetic
factors on risk for CRC and the effect of screening
require additional research. More research is also
needed to determine the best dosing strategies, the
long-term effects in persons with previous adenoma
and on adenoma prevention, and the durability of
benefits after aspirin is discontinued. Longer-term
follow-up of CVD prevention trials that report cancer
incidence and mortality outcomes would be helpful.
Additional research is needed to better estimate
the harms of aspirin-induced GI bleeding. Develop-
ment of an externally validated risk assessment tool for
bleeding that could be used at the point of care would
be helpful. A tool that considers both CVD risk and GI
bleeding risk would be useful to clinicians and patients
when deciding whether to start or continue aspirin use
for primary prevention.
DISCUSSION
Burden of Disease
Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the leading
causes of death among U.S. adults. Cardiovascular dis-
ease, including heart attack and stroke, is responsible
for 30% of all deaths in the United States (1). More than
26 million adults have been diagnosed and are living
with heart disease. Nearly 8 million adults have a his-
tory of MI and 6 million have a history of stroke. The
costs of caring for persons with CVD were estimated at
$315 billion in 2010 (2).
Cancer accounts for 1 in 4 deaths in the United
States. Colorectal cancer is the third-most common
cancer in the United States. In 2014, there were an es-
timated 137 000 new cases and 50 000 deaths due to
CRC (3).
Scope of Review
The USPSTF commissioned 3 systematic evidence
reviews and a decision-analysis model to develop its
recommendation on aspirin use to prevent CVD and
cancer. The systematic review on aspirin use to prevent
CVD is an update of the 2009 USPSTF review (2, 14).
The systematic review on aspirin use to prevent CRC is
an update of the 2007 USPSTF review (6, 7). The sys-
tematic review on aspirin use to prevent cancer other
than CRC is new (4, 7). A review of potential harms was
incorporated across all 3 systematic reviews (4, 5). The
primary studies of interest for all reviews focused on
primary prevention of CVD. Findings from the 3 coor-
dinated systematic reviews were integral to determin-
ing the parameters and assumptions used in the
decision-analysis model, which was used to estimate
net benefit for the recommendation (8, 12).
Effectiveness of Risk Assessment and Preventive
Medication
The USPSTF used a calculator derived from the
2013 ACC/AHA pooled cohort equations to estimate
CVD risk thresholds (3). The USPSTF selected this tool
because of its broader focus on CVD outcomes (com-
bining both cerebrovascular and cardiovascular out-
comes), its external validation in various U.S. popula-
tions, and its reasonable performance in studies. The
calculator predicts 10-year risk for a first hard athero-
sclerotic CVD event, defined as nonfatal MI, CHD
death, and fatal or nonfatal stroke. It was derived from

 participants in 4 community-based cohort studies spon-
sored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
The tool accounts for various CVD outcomes, in con-
trast to many earlier tools that report only CHD out-
comes. In addition, the cohorts from which it was
derived allowed for the development of sex- and race-
specific equations.
The USPSTF focused its review of the evidence on
studies of the primary prevention of CVD. It considered
11 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated
the benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of car-
diovascular events (15–25). Four of these studies were
published since the last USPSTF review in 2009 (15–17,
25). The trials had a total of 118 445 participants; 3
were conducted exclusively in men and 1 exclusively in
women. Participants' mean ages ranged from 55 to 65
years. Eight trials used an aspirin dose of 100 mg or
less daily. Duration of follow-up was between 3 and 10
years (22).
Primary prevention trials consistently demonstrated
effectiveness of aspirin in preventing nonfatal MI and
stroke. Pooled analysis of 8 trials of low-dose aspirin
(≤100 mg daily) showed a 17% reduction in nonfatal MI
and coronary events (relative risk [RR], 0.83 [95% CI,
0.74 to 0.94]). Pooled analysis of 10 trials using any
aspirin dose showed a 22% reduction.
Nonfatal strokes were also reduced when only low-
dose aspirin trials were included in the analysis (RR,
0.86 [CI, 0.76 to 0.98]). Few fatal stroke events were
reported in trials. Pooling the 11 trials showed a non-
significant reduction in CVD mortality (RR, 0.94 [CI, 0.86
to 1.03]); results were similar when analysis was re-
stricted to studies of low-dose aspirin.
Reduction in all-cause mortality was not significant
in any of the trials reporting it. However, when trial re-
sults were pooled, all-cause mortality risk was reduced
by 5% in participants taking low-dose aspirin (RR, 0.95
[CI, 0.89 to 1.01]). When trials using any aspirin dose
were considered, the reduction was statistically signifi-
cant (RR, 0.94 [CI, 0.89 to 0.99]) (14).
Subpopulation analyses evaluated effect modifica-
tion of aspirin by age, sex, and diabetes status. Analysis
supports the likelihood that older age groups have
greater MI benefit than younger age groups; however,
results were mixed. Evidence was not sufficient to sup-
port any sex-specific differences in CVD outcomes (14).
This differs from the 2009 analysis, in which sex-specific
outcome differences were apparent. This was likely due
to the predominance of findings from the Women's
Health Study, with its relatively young and healthy study
population. There were also no clear differences in out-
comes based on diabetes status.
There is evidence of a potential long-term benefit
on CRC mortality. Pooled data from primary and sec-
ondary CVD prevention trials with more than 10 years
of follow-up suggest that a reduction in long-term cu-
mulative CRC mortality is possible with aspirin use. The
mortality benefit did not become apparent until 10 to
20 years after randomization (3). Aspirin dose in these
trials ranged from 75 to 1200 mg per day, without clear
evidence of a dose-related effect. The USPSTF evalu-
ated 3 applicable primary and secondary CVD preven-
tion trials that reported a 40% reduction in CRC inci-
dence with aspirin use (RR, 0.60 [CI, 0.47 to 0.76]) 10 to
19 years after initiation (22, 26–28). These studies sug-
gest that at least 5 to 10 years of aspirin use is required
to achieve this reduction. A previously published
individual-patient data meta-analysis of 4 primary and
secondary CVD prevention trials showed a similar but
smaller reduction in CRC incidence (hazard ratio, 0.76
[CI, 0.63 to 0.94]) (29).
Although evidence of aspirin's effect on other
types of cancer is evolving, it has not yet been seen in
trial results. Total cancer mortality was not significantly
reduced across 10 RCTs of primary CVD prevention (4).
An analysis of 6 RCTs of primary CVD prevention also
showed no reduction in total cancer incidence. Other
published reports have demonstrated reductions in to-
tal cancer mortality and incidence, but the RCTs in-
cluded in the analyses differed from those reviewed by
the USPSTF (for example, different groupings of stud-
ies, not a CVD primary prevention population, or
higher doses of aspirin used) (4).
Potential Harms of Preventive Medication
Using aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD
variably increases risk for major GI and intracranial
bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke, depending on the
patient's medical history and other factors, such as con-
current medication use.
The USPSTF found only 1 risk prediction tool for
bleeding, based on a systematic review of risk esti-
mates and incidence of upper GI bleeding and CHD
with low-dose aspirin use (30). The tool presumes a
baseline incidence rate of upper GI complications of 1
event per 1000 person-years and is modified for 10-
year age ranges starting at age 50 years. The tool uses
Framingham sex-specific risk prediction equations for
CHD and modifies bleeding risk with use of proton-
pump inhibitors or Helicobacter pylori eradication, nei-
ther of which has been tested for net benefit as part of
a comprehensive prevention regimen. Two retrospec-
tive validation studies were conducted, but data were
insufficient to support its use for prospective prediction
in a clinical setting.
To evaluate the risk for GI bleeding, the most com-
mon serious harm of aspirin use, the USPSTF consid-
ered 7 of the CVD primary prevention trials previously
discussed (15, 17–19, 21–23). These trials reported ma-
jor GI bleeding events, defined as GI bleeding requir-
ing transfusion or hospitalization or leading to death.
Aspirin dose ranged from 50 to 325 mg in all but 1 trial.
Duration of use and follow-up ranged from 4 to 10
years. Major GI bleeding increased by 58% in aspirin
users (odds ratio [OR], 1.58 [CI, 1.29 to 1.95]). Analyses
of trials using the range of aspirin doses showed similar
results. When all major primary and secondary CVD
prevention trials were pooled (15 studies), the OR in-
creased further to 1.65 (4). Cohort studies reported
similar bleeding risk with aspirin use (10).
Hemorrhagic stroke was a rare event; 15.5% of to-
tal strokes reported in the trials were hemorrhagic.

 Across 9 primary CVD prevention trials, the rate of
hemorrhagic stroke was 2.54 strokes per 1000 person-
years in aspirin users and 1.95 strokes per 1000 person-
years in nonusers. Pooled analyses of low-dose aspirin
trials showed an increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke
(OR, 1.27 [CI, 0.96 to 1.68]) (5). Pooled analyses of 9
trials of any dose showed a significant 33% increase in
hemorrhagic stroke (OR, 1.33 [CI, 1.03 to 1.71]) (5).
Increased harms may result from factors that either
increase bleeding risk or enhance the bleeding effect
of aspirin. An adjusted individual-patient data meta-
analysis found that older age (per decade), male sex,
and diabetes increased risk for serious bleeding (31).
Smoking and increased blood pressure were also asso-
ciated with increased major extracranial bleeding. A
large cohort study of rates of hospitalization for major
bleeding events also suggested that older age, male
sex, and diabetes had effects on increasing bleeding
risk. Statin and proton-pump inhibitor use may de-
crease the likelihood of hospitalization from a major
bleeding event (10).
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF used a microsimulation model to esti-
mate the magnitude of net benefit (8, 12). The model
incorporated findings from the 3 systematic reviews to
inform its parameters and assumptions. Results were
stratified by age decade, sex, and 10-year CVD risk.
When combined with primary trial data and meta-
analyses, the model provides an additional analytic ba-
sis to assess the balance of benefits and harms of aspi-
rin use. In addition to the numbers of nonfatal MIs and
ischemic strokes prevented, CRC cases prevented, and
serious GI bleeding events caused by aspirin, the
USPSTF also considered net life-years and net QALYs
gained (or lost) over a lifetime as a result of aspirin use
(Table).
Initiating aspirin use during ages 50 to 59 years
and continuing unless contraindicated by an adverse
bleeding event results in the greatest gain in net life-
years (range, 219 to 463 life-years in women and 333 to
605 life-years in men) and net QALYs (range, 621 to
833 QALYs in women and 588 to 834 QALYs in men).
Initiating aspirin use during ages 60 to 69 years and
continuing unless contraindicated by an adverse bleed-
ing event results in smaller gains in net life-years
(range, �12 to 48 life-years in women and �20 to 116
life-years in men) and net QALYs (range, 284 to 360
QALYs in women and 180 to 318 QALYs in men). The
USPSTF chose the 10% 10-year CVD risk threshold as
the point at which the tradeoff of benefits and harms
reaches an adequate level of certainty. The benefits for
an individual patient may shift above or below the
threshold depending on individual risk assessment.
The USPSTF determined with moderate certainty
that the net benefit in life-years and QALYs gained from
aspirin use is moderate in adults aged 50 to 59 years.
Adults aged 60 to 69 years gain fewer net life-years and
QALYs because of the increased harms from bleeding
that come with older age and the reduced potential for
CRC benefits (that is, direct reduction in incidence and
indirect reduction in mortality), which require at least
10 years to become apparent. The USPSTF concluded
with moderate certainty that the net benefit from aspi-
rin use is small in adults aged 60 to 69 years. In both
age groups, persons with higher CVD risk will have a
greater net benefit (provided their bleeding risk is not
also increased).
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological
Understanding?
Aspirin is an NSAID. It is one of the most commonly
used drugs and is used mostly to relieve pain. Over the
past 30 years, its platelet and clotting effects have be-
come better understood. Its anticlotting effect is useful
for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular
events because it can potentially decrease the accumu-
lation of blood clots that form as the result of reduced
blood flow at atherosclerotic plaques, thereby reduc-
ing hypoxic damage to heart and brain tissue (32).
Aspirin is an irreversible cyclooxygenase (COX) in-
hibitor. The COX-1 enzyme is responsible for produc-
ing the prostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa.
Inhibition of the COX-1 enzyme leaves the mucosa sus-
ceptible to damage and GI bleeding. This negative ef-
fect increases at higher doses of aspirin (33).
The mechanisms for inhibition of adenoma or CRC
development are not yet well-understood. Cyclooxy-
genase-dependent and -independent pathways have
been proposed. Cyclooxygenase-dependent pathways
may rely on aspirin's anti-inflammatory properties to re-
duce tumorigenesis (3).
Response to Public Comment
A draft version of this recommendation statement
was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web
site from 15 September 2015 to 12 October 2015.
Many comments requested clarification about initiating
and continuing aspirin use, especially for persons in
their 60s and 70s. The USPSTF added language
throughout the recommendation statement to clarify its
focus on initiating aspirin use and enhanced the “Imple-
mentation” section to provide guidance on continuing
aspirin use. Several comments asked for clarification on
the use of aspirin to prevent CRC in persons who are
not at increased CVD risk. The USPSTF clarified that its
recommendation is based on the combined benefit of
CVD and CRC reduction, and only at 10-year CVD risk
levels of 10% or greater is there certainty that the ben-
efits exceed the harms of low-dose aspirin use. Several
comments found the tables difficult to interpret or
asked to include additional age and risk levels. The
USPSTF considered other presentations of the data, but
the tables represent the results from the decision-
analysis model that are most relevant to its estimation
of net benefits. Therefore, the tables only include the
age and sex ranges for which the USPSTF found mod-
erate certainty of small or moderate net benefit. More
detailed tables can be found in the decision analysis
report (8).

 UPDATE OF PREVIOUS USPSTF
RECOMMENDATION
This recommendation updates the 2009 USPSTF
recommendation on aspirin use to prevent CVD events
and the 2007 recommendation on aspirin and NSAID
use to prevent CRC. To update these recommenda-
tions, the USPSTF reviewed 5 additional studies of as-
pirin for the primary prevention of CVD and several ad-
ditional analyses of CRC follow-up data. The USPSTF
also relied on reviews of all-cause mortality and total
cancer incidence and mortality and a comprehensive
review of harms. The USPSTF then used a microsimula-
tion model to systematically estimate the balance of
benefits and harms.
RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS
The AHA and the American Stroke Association (34)
recommend the use of low-dose aspirin for cardiovas-
cular (including but not specific to stroke) prophylaxis
in adults whose risk is sufficiently high for the benefits
to outweigh the risks associated with treatment; they
suggest that a 10-year CVD risk of 6% to 10% is
sufficient.
The American Diabetes Association suggests low-
dose aspirin therapy for primary prevention in patients
with type 1 or 2 diabetes who have an increased CVD
risk (>10% 10-year CVD risk) and are not at increased
risk for bleeding. It does not recommend aspirin ther-
apy in men younger than 50 years or most women
younger than 60 years who have low CVD risk because
the risk for bleeding outweighs the potential benefits of
aspirin treatment (35).
Previous recommendations from the American
Academy of Family Physicians about aspirin use for the
primary prevention of CVD and CRC have been consis-
tent with those of the USPSTF (36). The American Col-
lege of Chest Physicians suggests that patients older
than 50 years without symptomatic CVD use low-dose
aspirin for primary CVD prevention (37).
No organizations recommend aspirin use for the
primary prevention of CRC in average-risk adults. The
American Cancer Society recognizes that long-term
regular aspirin use has both harms and benefits, includ-
ing reduced risk for CRC, but has not formally reviewed
the evidence and does not currently have recommen-
dations for or against aspirin use. The American Gastro-
enterological Association and the National Compre-
hensive Care Network limit their recommendations to
patients who are at increased risk for CRC (6).
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently
denied a manufacturer's request to add primary pre-
vention of MI as an indication for aspirin use in any risk
group. In a consumer bulletin, it noted the risks for
GI and intracranial bleeding and suggested that the
benefits of primary prevention have not been well-
established (38).

Appendix Table 1. What the USPSTF Grades Mean and Suggestions for Practice
Grade
Definition
Suggestions for Practice
A
The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty
that the net benefit is substantial.
Offer/provide this service.
B
The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty
that the net benefit is moderate or there is moderate
certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.
Offer/provide this service.
C
The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this
service to individual patients based on professional
judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate
certainty that the net benefit is small.
Offer/provide this service for selected patients depending on individual
circumstances.
D
The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is
moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit
or that the harms outweigh the benefits.
Discourage the use of this service.
I statement
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient
to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service.
Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the
balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.
Read the Clinical Considerations section of the USPSTF Recommendation
Statement. If the service is offered, patients should understand the
uncertainty about the balance of benefits and harms.
Appendix Table 2. USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit
Level of Certainty*
Description
High
The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative
primary care populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This
conclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies.
Moderate
The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the
estimate is constrained by such factors as:
the number, size, or quality of individual studies;
inconsistency of findings across individual studies;
limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice; and
lack of coherence in the chain of evidence.
As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may
be large enough to alter the conclusion.
Low
The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of:
the limited number or size of studies;
important flaws in study design or methods;
inconsistency of findings across individual studies;
gaps in the chain of evidence;
findings that are not generalizable to routine primary care practice; and
a lack of information on important health outcomes.
More information may allow an estimation of effects on health outcomes.
* The USPSTF defines certainty as “likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.” The net benefit is
defined as benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level
on the basis of the nature of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.
