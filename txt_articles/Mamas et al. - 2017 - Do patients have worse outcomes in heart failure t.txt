Methods
and results
Data were obtained from the Primary Care Clinical Informatics Unit from a database of 1.75 million people registered
with 393 general practices in Scotland. Sex-specific survival modelling was undertaken using Cox proportional hazards
models, adjusted for potential confounders. A total of 56 658 subjects were eligible for inclusion in the study. These
represented a total of 147 938 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up: 2.04 years). In men, HF (reference group;
5-year survival: 55.8%) had worse mortality outcomes than prostate cancer [hazard ratio (HR) 0.61, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.57–0.65; 5-year survival: 68.3%], and bladder cancer (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81–0.96; 5-year survival:
57.3%), but better outcomes than lung cancer (HR 3.86, 95% CI 3.65–4.07; 5-year survival: 8.4%) and colorectal
cancer (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.16–1.31; 5-year survival: 48.9%). In women, HF (reference group; 5-year survival: 49.5%)
had worse mortality outcomes than breast cancer (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.51–0.59; 5-year survival 77.7%), but better
outcomes than colorectal cancer (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13–1.29; 5-year survival 51.5%), lung cancer (HR 3.82, 95% CI
3.60–4.05; 5-year survival 10.4%), and ovarian cancer (HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.80–2.17; 5-year survival 38.2%).

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death globally,
accounting for an estimated 17.5 million deaths in 2012, or around
a third of all deaths worldwide.1 Heart failure (HF) represents
the end phenotype of many cardiovascular disorders and has

a prevalence of around 1–2% in the general population, rising
to >10% in individuals aged ≥70 years. Heart failure is also the
most common cause of hospitalization in people aged >65 years.2
Advances in pharmacological and intracardiac device-based thera-
pies have reduced mortality rates in patients with HF by as much as
50% over the past decade, but both short- and long-term mortality

rates remain significant.3–5 The adverse outcomes associated with
HF have drawn comparisons with those of cancer amongst many
commentators, including international cardiological societies.6
Collectively, cancer in all its forms represents the second leading
cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with approximately
14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths in 2012.7
As with cardiovascular disease, improved treatments over recent
decades have reduced mortality rates in many cancers.5,
8 A previ-
ous comparative analysis of patients with a first admission to hos-
pital in Scotland in 1991 with HF or one of the four most common
types of cancer specific to men and women, respectively, suggested
that, with the exception of lung and ovarian cancer, HF had a similar
or worse 5-year survival rate than the remaining cancers.9 A com-
parable analysis of over 1.1 million hospital admissions in Sweden
during 1998–2004 reported similar findings.5
Important limitations of these findings include the observation
that a first hospital admission for many cancers frequently relates
to elective surgery or investigations,5 whereas that for HF often
represents an acute HF syndrome. These differences will bias sur-
vival comparisons towards worse outcomes for HF. Furthermore,
until now, there has been no attempt to adjust for co-morbidity
burden,5,
9 which has been increasingly recognized as an important
confounding factor in this patient population that may substantially
affect survival.
Finally, although improved survival rates in patients diagnosed
with HF and with many cancers have been reported over the past
decade, these improvements may have occurred at different rates in
the various diagnostic groups and past comparisons, therefore, may
no longer hold. In view of the limitations of the previous studies
highlighted above, it is possible that survival rates in patients with
HF in the community are significantly better than those in patients
with a diagnosis of cancer in contemporary practice, particularly
when differences in co-morbid burden are taken into account. We
report here an analysis of outcomes in patients in care cohorts
derived from a national primary care database in Scotland with the
aim of investigating whether the often quoted maxim ‘
heart failure
is as malignant as cancer’still holds in contemporary practice.
Methods
Study design and setting
The data for this study were obtained from the Primary Care Clinical
Informatics Unit (PCCIU).10,
11 In brief, the PCCIU was founded in
1999 to feed information about aspects of clinical care back to
practices as part of the Royal College of General Practitioners Scotland
Programme of Clinical Improvement and Effectiveness (SPICE). The
work involved collecting anonymized clinical information bi-annually
between 2000 and 2011 from 393 practices across Scotland, which
together cared for about a third of the Scottish population, held data on
1.75 million patients and were representative of the Scottish population
in terms of spread of age, gender, material deprivation and rurality.12
We carried out a retrospective analysis of the PCCIU cohort; our
population consisted entirely of adults aged ≥16 years with an inci-
dent diagnosis of either HF or a cancer between 1 April 2002 and
31 March 2011 (the last date of update of the PCCIU dataset). The
first 3 years of the PCCIU (1 April 1999 to 30 March 2002) were used

to mitigate the risk for the inclusion of prevalent cases: patients with
diagnosis codes for either HF or cancer in this period were excluded.
Cancers were restricted to the four most common cancers by gen-
der and included prostate, lung, colorectal and bladder cancer in men,
and breast, colorectal, lung and ovarian cancer in women. The Read
codes (the clinical coding system used in UK general practice to record
patient diagnoses and procedures in health care IT systems) for these
diagnoses are given in the supplementary material online (Tables S1 and
S2). The primary exposure was first entry of the diagnosis of HF or
cancer type on the health care record, and the date of diagnosis was
the index date. Patients with diagnoses of both HF and cancer were
assigned to the cohort of patients associated with the diagnosis that
had been made first. When possible, we based our morbidity defini-
tions on Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) (http://qof.digital.nhs
.uk/) business rules13 and Read code groups for long-term disorders
[as defined by National Health Service (NHS) Scotland].14 The QOF is
the world’
s largest pay-for-performance programme. It was introduced
for all family practices in 2004 and links up to 25% of family practi-
tioners’income to performance for more than 100 publicly reported
quality indicators relating to the management of chronic disease, orga-
nization of care and patient experience. A significant proportion of a
family practitioner’
s income will depend on the maintenance of a reg-
ister of patients with a particular diagnosis (such as HF and cancer
diagnoses) and will also relate to the proportion of such patients who
receive evidence-based care.
The primary outcome was survival time to all-cause mortality.
Potential confounders accounted for included: age at index diagnosis
(continuous variable); material deprivation (Scottish Index of Multi-
ple Deprivation, in quintiles whereby 1 = least deprived and 5 = most
deprived); rurality (urban–rural index in six levels, of which level 1
represents the most urban and level 6 the most remote and rural);
smoking status, and co-morbidities (before index date only). These
confounders were treated as ever/never terms (i.e. they were not
time-varying). Co-morbidities were initially selected and derived from
Read codes following Barnett et al.10 A shortlist of these [hypertension,
depression, asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes, thyroid disease,
rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke
or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), chronic kidney disease, atrial fib-
rillation, peripheral vascular disease, epilepsy, dementia, schizophrenia,
bronchiectasis, Parkinson’
s disease, multiple sclerosis, viral hepatitis,
chronic liver disease, previous myocardial infarction] was then used
for subsequent modelling. Co-morbidities diagnosed after the index
date, and all medications for HF (diuretics, aldosterone receptor antag-
onists, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers,
anti-platelets and lipids) were not considered in multivariable models
(supplementary material online, Table S3). Data cleaning included the
removal of patients for whom information on deprivation and rurality
was missing, and of those with logical conflicts in the dates of recorded
events. Imputation of deprivation and rurality was considered but the
proportion of patients for whom these fields were missing was low
(1.94%) and it was felt reasonable to assume that these fields were
missing completely at random. The majority of the clinical variables
were binary indicators of presence of a clinical code; the associated
condition or medication was assumed to be absent if the code was
absent.
Statistical methods
Descriptive statistics were presented as means with standard devia-
tions (SDs), or proportions; these were stratified first by gender and

then by primary exposure. These were compared between exposure
groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA) (to compare means) or 𝜒2
tests (to compare proportions), with the P-values reported. Numbers
of co-morbidities were compared between disease groups graphically;
survival was compared between groups using Kaplan–Meier plots.
Sex-specific survival modelling was carried out using Cox propor-
tional hazards models. Three models were considered: (i) a univari-
able model with the primary diagnosis only; (ii) a model corrected for
demographic variables of age and deprivation; and (iii) a fully adjusted
model that corrected for all confounders described above (i.e. age,
deprivation, rurality, smoking status) and all of the co-morbidities
described above that were diagnosed before baseline. Many of these
confounders may be highly correlated, which may make their effect
sizes and standard errors difficult to interpret. However, we do not
make any inference about these. We did not correct for any medica-
tions because these may act as mediators. Continuous variables such
as age were treated as linear. The proportional hazards assumption
was checked using Schoenfeld residuals.15 All analyses were carried
out using R Version 3.0.2.16
Results
A total of 58 412 patients met the study inclusion criteria from a
database of 1.75 million people registered with 393 medical prac-
tices in Scotland. A total of 1754 (3.0%) patients were excluded,
including 1119 patients for whom deprivation data were lacking,
and 635 patients for whom the date of death represented the date
of diagnosis, or in whom the date of loss from follow-up could not
be established. Thus, the final dataset comprised 56 658 patients.
These included 28 064 men and 28 594 women, with a mean ± SD
age at first diagnosis of 69.16 ± 12.76 years. The median follow-up
was 2.04 years and the cohort represented a total of 147 938
person-years. Diagnoses in men included 6795 cases of prostate
cancer, 4693 of lung cancer, 4239 of colorectal cancer, 2028 of
bladder cancer, and 10 309 of HF. Among the women, 10 760 had
breast cancer, 3610 had colorectal cancer, 3859 had lung cancer,
1234 had ovarian cancer, and 9131 had HF.
Descriptive sample characteristics are presented in Table 1
for men and in Table 2 for women. In men, ages at cancer
and HF diagnoses were similar, whereas in women a diagno-
sis of HF occurred later in life than one of cancer. Patients
with HF, both men and women, had more co-morbidities than
those with cancer; only 5.5% of HF patients of either gender
had no co-morbidity, compared with 20–38% of patients with
a diagnosis of cancer. The mean number of co-morbid con-
ditions was also greater in patients with HF compared with
patients diagnosed with cancer. Male patients with HF had a
mean ± SD of 2.62 ± 1.55 co-morbidities, whereas patients diag-
nosed with cancer had fewer (prostate cancer: 1.47 ± 1.38; lung
cancer: 1.79 ± 1.56; colorectal cancer: 1.52 ± 1.49; bladder can-
cer: 1.71 ± 1.52). Similar observations were recorded in women,
in whom a mean ± SD of 2.8 ± 1.61 co-morbidities were reported
in patients with HF and lower numbers were recorded in the
other diagnoses (breast cancer: 1.19 ± 1.31; colorectal cancer:
1.52 ± 1.46; lung cancer: 1.95 ± 1.60; ovarian cancer: 1.21 ± 1.32).
Numbers of co-morbidities at index date in each disease and by
gender are shown in Figure 1.

Crude mortality rates at 30 days, 1 year and 5 years are also
presented in Tables 1 and 2. The highest crude mortality rates
occurred in patients with lung cancer, with 8.7% of men and 9.3%
of women dying within 30 days. The lowest crude mortality rates
were recorded in women diagnosed with breast cancer (0.5%) and
men diagnosed with prostate cancer (0.4%). In subjects diagnosed
with HF, 30-day mortality rates were 1.5% in men and 2.2% in
women, and 1-year mortality rates were 14.5% and 17.7% in men
and women, respectively.
Kaplan–Meier plots for overall survival in years since diagnosis
are presented in Figure 2. The main Cox proportional hazards
model results are presented in Table 3. Men with prostate cancer
[hazard ratio (HR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57–0.65;
P < 0.001] or bladder cancer (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81–0.96;
P < 0.005) had better survival than those with HF, whereas those
with lung cancer (HR 3.86, 95% CI 3.65–4.07; P < 0.001) or
colorectal cancer (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.16–1.31; P < 0.001) gen-
erally fared worse. Women with breast cancer (HR 0.55, 95%
CI 0.51–0.59; P < 0.001) had better survival than those with HF,
whereas those with lung cancer (HR 3.82, 95% CI 3.60–4.05,
P < 0.001), ovarian cancer (HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.80–2.17; P < 0.001)
or colorectal cancer (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13–1.29; P < 0.001)
fared worse.
All models showed some deviation from proportional hazards.
Deviations still existed in the fully corrected models, but were
minor and so should not affect the interpretation of the results
(see supplementary material online, Tables S4 and S5).
Discussion
Our analysis is the first to compare survival outcomes in a primary
care setting in patients with diagnoses of HF or any of the four
most common cancers in men and women, respectively, in a con-
temporary cohort of patients treated with current evidence-based
practice that has changed dramatically over the two decades since
the older studies first reported outcomes following first hospi-
tal admission with a diagnosis of HF or cancer. Despite advances
in care, we found that men and women with a diagnosis of HF
continue to have worse survival than patients with one of several
common cancers. Our findings are particularly relevant given that
the current analysis overcomes many of the limitations of previous
work, particularly in relation to admission bias for different condi-
tions and differences in co-morbid burden between patients with
HF and those with cancer.
Advances in both medical and device-based treatments have
been associated with improved survival rates in patients with
HF in many17–20 but not all national registry-based studies.21
Age-standardized rates of death from HF are reported to have
decreased by 40% in seven European countries from 1987 to
2008.4 An analysis of all patients in Scotland hospitalized with a
first episode of HF between 1986 and 2003 demonstrated relative
declines in short- and medium-term case fatality rates of 40–50%
in men and 20–25% in women; these changes are associated with
significant increases in ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker use over this
period.17

There are limited data regarding longer-term outcomes of inci-
dent HF in the community. Our analysis suggests that mortal-
ity rates in patients with this condition remain significant. Our
observed 1- and 5-year mortality rates of 14.4% and 62.3%, respec-
tively, in males, and 17.7% and 68.1%, respectively, in females from
time of first recorded diagnosis of HF are lower than mortality
rates recorded following an acute admission to hospital for HF,22,
23
probably because the latter population represents a sicker cohort.
Our mortality rates are greater than the 5-year mortality rate of

38% reported in a contemporary community cohort of subjects
with new diagnoses of HF assembled in Ireland.24 Similarly, the
Echocardiographic Heart of England Screening Study (ECHOES)
community-based study reported 5-year mortality rates of 38%
in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and 47% in HF
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), although the study rep-
resented a cross-sectional analysis and did not report on survival
from time of diagnosis.25 Similarly, data derived from Olmsted
County reported 5-year survival of 45%, but again referred to a

cross-sectional survival analysis in which data were derived from
the time of initiation of the study rather than from the time of diag-
nosis of HF, which may have introduced a degree of bias towards a
poorer outcome.26
Survival rates in HF, and in many cancers, have improved over the
past decade, but these improvements have occurred at different
rates in HF and cancer populations. For example, an analysis
of hospital admissions in Sweden conducted by Stewart et al.
suggested that survival rates in HF admissions had improved
by a greater margin each calendar year than had survival rates
in the various cancers studied.5 Although our analysis is not
subject to many of the limitations of previous analyses, such

as admission bias and failure to adjust for type and number of
co-morbidities,5,
9 our findings are remarkably similar to those
reported initially by Stewart et al.9 and subsequently from hospital
admission data derived from Sweden.5 This suggests that even
in a more contemporaneous cohort (by at least a decade), a
diagnosis of HF remains as ‘
malignant’as that of some cancers. Our
findings were broadly consistent when the data were stratified by
co-morbid burden and age at diagnosis.
The burden of co-morbidity among patients with HF is
significant.27 Only 3.0% of patients with HF had no recorded
co-morbidity, whereas up to a third of patients with a cancer
diagnosis had no co-morbid conditions documented in their

medical record. Numbers of co-morbidities in patients with HF
appeared to be similar in both sexes despite the 6-year increase
in average age at diagnosis in women with HF in comparison with
men. Previous studies have also reported a significant co-morbidity
burden in patients with HF, the presence of which is independently
associated with increased mortality.28,
29 This burden appears to
have increased over time.29 In the Cardiovascular Research Net-
work PRESERVE study, undertaken during 2005–08, fewer than
2% of HF patients had no co-morbid conditions.30 Data derived
from the Spanish National Heart Failure Registry suggest that
only 15% of patients with HF have no co-morbidity.28 Only 4%
of individuals with HF in a Medicare dataset of 122 630 patients
had no non-cardiac co-morbid conditions and 40% had five or
more such co-morbidities.31 It is not surprising that the burden
of cardiovascular co-morbidities is greatest in patients with HF,
given that many of these conditions, such as diabetes mellitus,
hypertension and coronary artery disease, are risk factors for
the future development of HF.32 In contrast, studies of patients
with cancer suggest that the co-morbid burden is significantly
lower in this population. For instance, perhaps only half of all lung
cancer patients have co-morbidities,33 and even fewer patients
with breast, ovarian or uterine cancers do so.34
Our data suggest that the burden of cardiovascular disease in
patients with a diagnosis of cancer is also significant: 20% of men
with a common cancer also have a diagnosis of coronary artery
disease; 10–20% of both genders are diagnosed with diabetes;
rates of previous strokes or TIAs are significant, particularly in
men, and prevalences of hypertension vary between 30% and
45% in both genders. Previous registry-based studies have also
reported significant rates of cardiovascular co-morbidity in patients
with lung and prostate cancer.35,
36 Cardiovascular co-morbidity and
estimated cardiovascular risk have been independently associated
with worse outcomes in patients with lung and breast cancer.35,
37
Our study is subject to several limitations. Firstly, we relied on
primary care coding to identify the study cohort and did not val-
idate the codes. Like all other observational research undertaken

using data derived from electronic health care records, PCCIU
research relies on clinicians’observations and the entry of rele-
vant codes into electronic health care records, which may result in
an incomplete or inaccurate representation of a patient’
s health.
Whereas diagnoses of cancer are generally made by specialists
based on imaging or biopsy information and hence are robust,
diagnoses of HF may be clinical in the first instance and may
be less robust, particularly in the presence of obesity or other
conditions associated with dyspnoea and oedema. However, the
diagnosis of HF is well recorded in UK primary care electronic
health care records because it is an important part of the QOF
pay-for-performance scheme, which requires the maintenance of
a register of patients with a diagnosis of HF, and records the
percentage of such patients with a diagnosis of HF confirmed by
echocardiography or by specialist assessment at 3 months before
or 12 months after entry to the register. In Scotland, the percent-
age of patients with a diagnosis of HF (diagnosed on or after 1 April
2006) as confirmed by echocardiography or by specialist assess-
ment at 3 months before or 12 months after entry to the register
exceeds 95%,38 which suggests that the diagnosis of HF is robust.
Furthermore, the associated risk factor profile and survival rates
among the HF and cancer cohorts are in line with those reported
in the literature for incident HF and cancer in the community. Sec-
ondly, although we were able to report on outcomes associated
with a diagnosis of HF, we were unable to differentiate between
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart fail-
ure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Previous studies have
suggested that patients with HFrEF have short- and long-term mor-
tality outcomes similar39 to or worse40 than those in patients with
HFpEF, and hence the comparisons of outcomes in HFrEF and
HFpEF, respectively, with those in patients with a cancer diagno-
sis may differ. Thirdly, although our analysis captures the diagnosis
of cancer in the primary care health record, it does not provide
information relating to the stage of cancer, whether the cancer
is in remission, whether the cancer has been ‘
cured’
, or what
cancer-related treatments were given. Finally, in order to reduce

the risk for length of time bias and to exclude prevalent cases of
HF or cancer, patients with diagnosis codes for either HF or can-
cer during the first 3 years of the PCCIU (1 April 1999 to 30 March
2002) were excluded and only patients who had been registered
with the practice for at least 3 months prior to their index diagnosis
date were included. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibil-
ity that non-incident cases of either HF or cancer were included in
the study cohort, although the numbers of these would be small.
In conclusion, the current report of over 147 938 person-years
of observation is the first to compare survival outcomes in a pri-
mary care setting in patients with diagnoses of, respectively, HF and
each of the four most common cancers in men and women sepa-
rately. The study reveals that despite advances in management, HF
remains as ‘
malignant’as some common cancers. Our results high-
light the substantial multi-morbidity associated with HF that will
represent a significant challenge to the delivery of health care in the
future, particularly as the burden of HF continues to grow. Targeted
management of the co-morbidities common in HF may be associ-
ated with better survival and quality of life in this patient population.
