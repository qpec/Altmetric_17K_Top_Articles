The rise in the number of people diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may in 
part be due to an increase in the diagnosis of individuals with less severe behaviours. The 
current study examined whether there were changes over time in the behavioural severity of 
individuals who received the diagnosis of Autistic Disorder. Data were from a register of new 
ASD diagnoses in Western Australia (n = 1252). From 2000 to 2006, we examined 
differences in the both percentage of newly diagnosed individuals meeting each of the 12 
criterion for Autistic Disorder as well as severity ratings of the behaviours observed (not met, 
partially met, mild/moderate and extreme). We found a statistically significant reduction from 
2000 to 2006 in the percentage of new diagnoses meeting two of 12 criteria. There was also a 
reduction across the study period in the proportion of new cases rated as having extreme 
severity on six criteria. There was a reduction in the proportion of individuals with three or 
more criteria rated as extreme from 2000 (16.0%) to 2006 (1.6%), while percentage of new 
cases with no ‘extreme’ rating on any criteria increased from 58.5% to 86.6% across the same 
period. This study provides the first clear evidence of a reduction over time in the behavioral 
severity of individuals diagnosed with Autistic Disorder. A shift towards diagnosing 
individuals with less severe behavioral symptoms may have contributed to the increasing 
prevalence of Autistic Disorder diagnoses.

The increasing prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may in part be due to a shift 
in the diagnostic threshold that has led to individuals with a less severe behavioural 
phenotype receiving a clinical diagnosis. The current study examined whether there were 
changes over time in the qualitative and quantitative phenotype of individuals who received 
the diagnosis of Autistic Disorder. Data were from a prospective register of new diagnoses in 
Western Australia (n=1252). From 2000 to 2006, we examined differences in both the 
percentage of newly diagnosed cases that met each criterion as well as severity ratings of the 
behaviours observed (not met, partially met, mild/moderate and extreme). Linear regression 
determined there was a statistically significant reduction from 2000 to 2006 in the percentage 
of new diagnoses meeting two of 12 criteria. There was also a reduction across the study 
period in the proportion of new cases rated as having extreme severity on six criteria. There 
was a reduction in the proportion of individuals with three or more criteria rated as extreme 
from 2000 (16.0%) to 2006 (1.6%), while percentage of new cases with no ‘extreme’ rating 
on any criteria increased from 58.5% to 86.6% across the same period. This study provides 
the first clear evidence of a reduction over time in the behavioral severity of individuals 
diagnosed with Autistic Disorder during a period of stability in diagnostic criteria. A shift 
towards diagnosing individuals with less severe behavioral symptoms may have contributed 
to the increasing prevalence of Autistic Disorder diagnoses.

 Introduction 
 
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the present day diagnostic term for neurodevelopmental 
disabilities characterized by impairments in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal 
communication and by repetitive patterns of behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 
2013). In the absence of any consistent biological markers, a diagnosis of ASD is based on an 
appraisal of the qualitative nature and quantitative severity of these behavioral symptoms. 
ASD was first recognised in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (DSM-III, American Psychiatric Association, 1980) as Infantile Autism, 
which described a highly constrained behavioral phenotype characterised by relatively severe 
symptomatology. Subsequent research identified that individuals who are less severely 
affected in terms of language ability and IQ may also present with the behavioural 
characteristics of ASD (Bishop, 1989; Georgiades et al. 2007), and more recent versions of 
the DSM incorporated flexibility into the behavioral requirements for a diagnosis. For 
example, DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) introduced the category of 
Autistic Disorder, also included in the text revision (American Psychiatric Association, 
2000), which listed 12 criteria across three behavioural domains: Social impairments, 
communication difficulties, and restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests (RRBI). 
Individuals were deemed to meet the diagnostic threshold if they demonstrated specified 
combinations of six or more behavioural criteria across the three domains. 
 
There is evidence that the broadening of diagnostic criteria from DSM-III to DSM-IV has 
played a role in the increasing numbers of individuals diagnosed with an ASD over the past 
three decades (Bishop, Whitehouse, Watt & Line, 2008; King & Bearman, 2009; Leonard et 
al., 2010; Miller et al., 2012; Shattuck, 2006). In a systematic review of prevalence studies, 
5 
 Williams and colleagues found that epidemiological studies using DSM-IV criteria led to 
prevalence estimates three times those of studies using previous diagnostic criteria (Williams, 
Higgins, & Brayne, 2006). However, there is also evidence that the prevalence of ASD has 
continued to rise beyond the immediate period after the introduction of DSM-IV (Boyle et al., 
2011; Maenner & Durkin, 2010; Parner et al., 2011). A recent population-based study in 
Sweden reported a significant increase in the prevalence of Autistic Disorder diagnoses 
between the years 1993 and 2002, but no rise in the level of autistic symptoms in the general 
population (Lundström et al., 2015). These findings raise the possibility that the increasing 
prevalence of ASD may have been driven by a shift in the diagnostic threshold over time 
towards diagnosing individuals with less severe autistic behaviours. However, no study has 
directly tested this hypothesis or quantified the effect. 
 
The current study examined data from a register of newly diagnosed cases of ASD in 
Western Australia. Data are collected prospectively and include information on the diagnostic 
criteria met by each new case, as well as the severity of behaviours relevant to each criterion. 
We investigated all new cases that received the diagnosis of Autistic Disorder (diagnosed 
using DSM-IV-TR guidelines) from 2000 to 2006. The number of cases of Autistic Disorder 
in Western Australia has increased steadily over this period (Parner et al., 2011). The current 
study investigated the stability of criterion severity ratings over this seven-year time period 
during which the DSM-IV-TR criteria were stable, and tested the hypothesis that there has 
been population-level changes in the behavioural severity of individuals receiving a diagnosis 
of Autistic Disorder.

 Methods 
 
Cohort 
Western Australia has a population of approximately 2.6 million people (10% of Australia’s 
population). The majority (77%) of Western Australia’s population live in the capital city, 
Perth (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011), and the vast majority of ASD diagnostic and 
intervention services are coordinated from this centre. Since 1997, Western Australia has had 
a standardized procedure for diagnosis of ASDs and eligibility for Government-supported 
therapy provision (Glasson et al., 2008). For children younger than 12 years of age, the 
diagnostic assessment must be performed by a team of three independent health professionals 
(paediatrician or psychiatrist, psychologist, and speech-language pathologist), and for 
adolescents (12-17 years) and adults, an assessment must be carried out by a clinical 
psychologist, a paediatrician (for adolescents) and/or a psychiatrist, with the inclusion of a 
formalised assessment by a speech-language pathologist as needed.  
 
The Western Australian Register for Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter, ‘Autism 
Register’) is an independent, prospective collection of demographic and diagnostic data 
established January 1999 for newly diagnosed cases of ASDs in Western Australia (Glasson, 
2002). At the time of diagnosis, the diagnosing clinicians submit information to the Autism 
Register using a dedicated form. Notification of new cases to the Autism Register is 
voluntary, but ascertainment during the period covered by this study (2000 – 2006 inclusive) 
was enhanced by annual archival reviews of the four Government centres at which the 
majority of diagnostic assessments in Western Australia were conducted. One of these 
centres was also the primary administrative contact in Western Australia for families enrolled 
in Government supported ASD therapy services, which are available to all children in this 
7 
 jurisdiction with a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder. The diagnostic information of any cases 
found not to have been notified to the Autism Register was added to the annual collections, 
but without identifying details attached. Data collection has ethical approval from the 
Princess Margaret Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (294EP). 
 
In order to compare phenotypic changes over time in a large number of individuals diagnosed 
under consistent criteria, the current study included those cases who were diagnosed with 
Autistic Disorder (under DSM-IV-TR guidelines) in Western Australia between the years 
2000 and 2006 (inclusive). These years were selected for analysis because during this period: 
(1) diagnostic assessments were predominantly conducted through four Government centres, 
and there was a central administrative portal for archival reviews, which provided confidence 
in achieving near-complete ascertainment of new cases of Autistic Disorder; (2) 
diagnosticians were strongly encouraged to complete severity scores for each criterion, and a 
near complete data-set was available; and (3) numerous studies (Boyle et al., 2011; Maenner 
& Durkin, 2010), including those in Western Australia (Parner et al., 2011), have found that 
this period corresponded to a particular increase in the prevalence of Autistic Disorder. 
 
There were 1303 individuals who met the study inclusion criteria. Of these cases, 823 were 
notified to the Autism Register and 480 were added through archival reviews. A small 
number of cases (n = 51) were excluded from analyses because complete data on the criteria 
met and/or severity ratings were not provided by the diagnosing clinician(s), which left a 
final sample size of 1252 cases.  
 
Diagnostic and behavioral characteristics 
8 
 At the time of diagnosis, diagnosticians completed a data collection form and submitted this 
to the Autism Register. The form included DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria and diagnosticians 
were asked to rate the criteria for each new diagnostic case according to a four point scale: 
(0) Criteria definitely not met; (1) Criteria questionable/partially met, (2) Clearly meets 
criterion to mild or moderate degree, and (3) Clearly meets criterion to an extreme degree. 
Diagnosticians also indicated if a criterion was not assessed. 
 
Diagnosticians indicated on the data collection form whether the Vineland Adaptive Behavior 
Scales–Version 1 (VABS; Sparrow, Balla, & Cicchetti, 1984) was completed at the time of 
diagnosis. Those who completed the VABS were asked to provide standardized scores for the 
Adaptive Behavior Composite Score and the Communication, Daily Living Skills, 
Socialisation and Motor Skills domains (if completed). Lower standardized scores represent 
greater functional impairment. 
 
Statistical analysis 
Data consisted of one record per individual. Multiple variables were created for each 
diagnostic criterion including: (a) the original rating (0 to 3 scale), (b) a dichotomous criteria 
met or not met (met being defined as a score of 2 or 3) variable; and (c) a dichotomous rating 
of ‘extreme’ or ’not extreme’ (extreme being defined as a score of 3) variable. These were 
aggregated to counts and percentage per calendar year of diagnosis. 
 
All data analyses were completed using R (R Core Team, 2012). Analyses included 
investigations of: (a) the age and sex distribution of the sample across the study period; (b) 
change in percentage of cases deemed to meet diagnosis criteria (individually); (c) change in 
percentage of individuals deemed to be displaying extreme behaviors for diagnosis criteria 
9 
 (individually and aggregated), and (d) the number of criteria diagnosed as extreme (per case). 
Percentage change across calendar years within the study period was quantified using linear 
regression. As a sensitivity analysis, unit record data were analysed under a generalised linear 
model, modelled under the binomial distribution with the log link function, to calculate risk 
ratios. These analyses included adjustment for age and sex. It is likely that individuals who 
receive an ASD diagnoses during adulthood have different behavioral profiles to individuals 
who are diagnosed during childhood. To investigate the robustness of using whole population 
data, the analyses above were replicated restricting the data to only those individuals who 
were 18 years of age or younger at the time of diagnosis. Interaction terms between sex and 
calendar year were included, with models compared via ANOVA to assess the significance of 
the interaction term. 
 
VABS standard scores were available for less than half of the current sample (see 
Supplementary Table 3 for numbers), which is insufficient ascertainment to determine whole 
population trends over time. However, these scores provided an opportunity to examine the 
validity of clinician severity ratings. Separate linear regression analyses were conducted to 
examine the relationship between VABS standardized scores and the relevant DSM-IV-TR 
criteria severity ratings. While the associations between VABS scores and autistic 
symptomatology in the ASD population are often weak, the highest correlations are observed 
between scores on the VABS Socialization domain and autistic behaviours in the social 
domain of DSM criteria (Klin et al., 2007; Perry, Flanagan, Dunn Geier & Freeman, 2009), 
and so analyses focused on these relationships.

 Results 
 
Demographic data 
For the 1252 individuals who met the inclusion criteria, there was no statistically significant 
association between age at diagnosis or sex and calendar year across the study period (Table 
1). The mean age of diagnosis was 6.47 (SD = 4.72) years and 82.5% of the sample was 
male. 
 
Changes in diagnostic criteria met 
Linear regression identified a statistically significant decrease in the number of criteria 
deemed as ‘met’ per individual across the study period, decreasing by -0.067 (95% CI; -
0.108,-0.026; p < 0.01) per calendar year (Table 2). However this was not deemed clinically 
significant as the mean count was 8.22 in 2000 and only dropped to 8.02 in 2006, with the 
lowest value observed in 2005 (7.87). 
 
Table 2 also presents the annual count and percentage of individuals meeting each DSM-IV-
TR criterion. There was a statistically significant decrease per calendar year in the percentage 
of new diagnostic cases meeting criteria 1b (failure to develop peer relationships), -2.5% 
(95% CI -4.3, -0.8; p = .013), and 3a (preoccupation with restricted interests), -2.0% (95% 
CI -3.0,-1.0; p = .003). There was also a borderline significant (p < 0.1) decrease in the 
percentage of new diagnostic cases meeting criteria 2a (delay in, or total lack of, spoken 
language), -1.4% (95% CI -3.0, 0.2; p = .08), and 3b (inflexible adherence to routines), -
1.8% (95% CI -3.7, 0.1; p = .057). There was a significant increase per calendar year in new 
diagnostic cases meeting criteria 3d (persistent preoccupation with parts of an object), 2.3% 
11 
 (95% CI 1.2, 3.5; p = .004). No statistically significant changes over time were observed for 
the remaining criteria. 
 
Changes in behavioral severity of diagnostic criteria met 
Figure 1 presents change over time in the proportion of individuals who were rated as 
meeting a given criterion to an ‘extreme’ degree. Statistically significant decreases were 
observed for criteria 1a, 1b, 1c, 2b, 3a and 3b (all p values < .05), with the smallest 
statistically significant rate of decrease observed for criteria 2b (-0.7% per year, 95% CI -1.4, 
-0.1; p = .031) and the largest observed for criteria 1a (-2.1% per year, 95% CI -3.1,-1.2; p = 
.002). There was also a significant decrease per year in the percentage of individuals with any 
diagnostic criteria rated as ‘extreme’ (-3.8% per year, 95% CI -5.4,-2.2; p = 0.002, Figure 2). 
Table 3 presents beta coefficients from linear regression analyses for each criterion as well as 
across the three domains. The adjusted R-squared values suggest a large portion of the 
variation present is explained by calendar year. A sensitivity analysis was carried out 
modelling individual risk of receiving a severity rating of ’extreme’ for each criterion over 
time, adjusting for age and sex. The magnitude and direction of the results (risk ratios) were 
in line with those above and are presented in Supplementary Table 1a. The risk ratio 
estimates presented in Table 3 saw no major deviation when these analyses were repeated 
excluding the 20 (1.6%) of subjects aged over 18 years at the time of diagnosis, presented in 
Supplementary Table 1b. The interaction terms between sex and calendar year were not 
significant, and Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 1 show the consistency in 
observations and trend estimates between males and females. 
 
The percentage of individuals with ‘extreme’ ratings for at least three criteria declined from 
16.0% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2006, while the percentage of new cases with no ‘extreme’ ratings 
12 
 increased from 58.5% to 86.6% across the same period (Figure 3a). There was no increase 
across calendar year observed in the number of individuals presenting with an ’extreme’ 
diagnosis for at least one criteria, -1.3 (95% CI -3.6, 1.1; p = .218), which contrasts with a 
statistically significant increase per year in the number of individuals with no extreme ratings, 
21.7 per calendar year (95% CI 14.0, 29.4; p = .001) (Figure 3b). 
 
Validity of clinician severity ratings: VABS 
Supplementary Table 3 presents VABS standard scores as a function of clinician severity 
ratings. Numerous main effects were identified, including for Adaptive Behavior Composite 
scores in relation to severity ratings on Criteria 1b and 1c, for the Communication subscale 
scores in relation to ratings on Criteria 1a and 1c, and for the Socialization subscale scores in 
relation to ratings on Criteria 1b and 1c. Linear regression also revealed a significant effect of 
calendar year on the VABS Adaptive Behavior Composite score and Socialization subscale, 
indicating increasing VABS scores (less functional impairment) from 2000 to 2006 
(Supplementary Table 4). 
 
Discussion 
 
The current study provides the first evidence for population-level changes over time in the 
qualitative and quantitative phenotype of Autistic Disorder. Across the study period (2000 to 
2006), there was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of new diagnostic cases 
meeting two criteria (1b and 3a), and a reduction in the proportion of new cases rated as 
having ‘extreme’ severity for 6 of the 12 diagnostic criteria (1a, 1b, 1c, 2b, 3a and 3b). We 
found a significant reduction in the proportion of individuals given an extreme rating on three 
or more criteria from 2000 (16.0%) to 2006 (1.6%), while the percentage of new cases with 
13 
 no ‘extreme’ rating on any criteria increased from 58.5% to 86.6% across the same period. 
The observed changes in the diagnostic phenotype are even more striking given that the same 
criteria (DSM-IV-TR) were used during the entire study period, and the jurisdiction of 
Western Australia had a rigorous and standardized protocol for Autistic Disorder diagnoses. 
 
There was a statistically significant reduction over time in the endorsement of criteria 1b 
(failure to develop peer relationships to appropriate developmental level) and a borderline 
significant decrease in the endorsement of criteria 2a (delay in, or total of, the development of 
spoken language). These criteria are reflective of broader developmental abilities, and the 
observed changes appear to indicate a reduction over time in the proportion of new diagnoses 
with significant functional difficulties. There was also a statistically significant reduction 
over time in the endorsement of 3a (preoccupation with restricted interests) and a borderline 
significant reduction in the endorsement of 3b (inflexible adherence to routines/rituals), but 
an increase in the proportion of new diagnoses meeting criterion 3d (persistent preoccupation 
with parts of an object). It is arguable that the behaviours consistent with criteria 3a and 3b 
represent greater functional impairment to an individual than those reflected by criterion 3d, 
and that this qualitative shift in diagnostic characteristics is also indicative of a reduction over 
time in the proportion of new diagnoses with a high degree of functional difficulties. 
 
The major strength of the study design is the prospective, population-level data from a 
jurisdiction that had a standardised and rigorous diagnostic protocol for Autistic Disorder 
(Glasson, 2002). Despite notification to the Autism Registry being voluntary, we have reason 
to believe that the current sample represents near-complete ascertainment of all diagnoses of 
‘Autistic Disorder’ in Western Australia from 2000 to 2006. During the study period, the vast 
majority of diagnostic assessments for Autistic Disorder were made at four centres, including 
14 
 one centre which was the primary administrative contact for Government-supported 
therapeutic services (eligible to all individuals with a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder). Annual 
archival reviews were conducted at each of these centres to identify and add to the Autism 
Register any cases that were not initially notified. We cannot rule out the possibility that there 
were a small number of cases who received both privately-funded diagnostic and therapeutic 
services and were not notified to the Autism Register. However, even cases diagnosed at 
small private clinics operating in Western Australia between 2000 and 2006 were required to 
be registered centrally for service provision and these pathways were approached for any 
missed cases. For this reason, we believe that the cohort of individuals who received a 
diagnosis of Autistic Disorder but were not added to the Autism Register, if any, would 
represent a small number of cases with less severe phenotypes, and would not alter the main 
conclusions of the study. 
 
Clinician ratings of the severity of the behaviours relevant to each criterion was another 
strength of the study design. While severity ratings are part of the diagnostic classifications 
for ASD under DSM-5 guidelines, the use of ratings was not standard practice for diagnoses 
under DSM-IV-TR in other jurisdictions. It is important to highlight that the severity ratings 
had broad definitions, and that inter-rater reliability for clinician ratings could not be 
established from existing data. However, the VABS was completed on a proportion of cases, 
and we were able to demonstrate that standard scores on this measure (particularly the Total 
Composite, and the Communication and Socialization subscales) varied as a function of 
clinician severity ratings.  
 
The current findings may inform our understanding of why the prevalence of ASD diagnoses 
has increased markedly over the past 50 years from 0.05% in the 1960s (Lotter, 1966) to at 
15 
 least 1% in the 2010s (Elsabbagh et al., 2012). In the current study, we found that the number 
of individuals with no diagnostic criteria rated as ‘extreme’ in severity increased by an 
average of 21 cases per year from 2000 to 2006, whereas there was no statistically significant 
increase in the number of individuals with at least one diagnostic criterion rated as ‘extreme’. 
This observation indicates that the majority of the increase in Autistic Disorder diagnoses in 
Western Australia during this period (Parner et al., 2011) is likely due to an increase in the 
diagnoses of individuals with less severe behavioural phenotypes. A range of sociological 
factors may have contributed to changes over time in the behavioural profiles of individuals 
presenting for a diagnostic assessment, including greater awareness of ASD among clinicians 
and the community (Charman 2002; Leonard et al., 2010) and the introduction of 
Government funded services specific to individuals with a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder 
(Gurney et al., 2003; Leonard et al., 2010; Mandell & Palmer, 2005; Nassar et al., 2009).  
 
The current findings also have implications for future revisions of the diagnostic criteria for 
ASD. The population-level changes observed in the current study were across a study period 
that commenced six years after the introduction of the diagnostic category of Autistic 
Disorder (in DSM-IV in 1994). The findings indicate that population-level changes to the 
behavioural phenotype of community-based diagnoses can occur even during periods of 
stability in diagnostic criteria. The DSM-5 included several significant changes to the DSM-
IV-TR diagnostic criteria for ASD, including combining the social and communication 
behavioral domains into a single ‘social communication’ domain. There are significantly 
fewer combinations of symptoms that lead to an ASD diagnosis under DSM-5 guidelines, 
which several studies have indicated may decrease the number of individuals diagnosed with 
ASD (Bennet & Goodall, 2016; Kulage, Smaldone, & Cohn, 2014). While the longer-term 
effects of the new diagnostic criteria on the behavioral phenotype of ASD is uncertain, 
16 
 clinician severity ratings are a key part of the DSM-5 criteria for ASD, which will facilitate 
ongoing monitoring.
