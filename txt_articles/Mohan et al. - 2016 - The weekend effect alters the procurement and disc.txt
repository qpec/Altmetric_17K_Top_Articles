Abstract
Factors contributing to the high rate of discard among deceased donor kidneys remain poorly 
understood and the influence of resource limitations of weekends on kidney transplantation is 
unknown. To quantify this we used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and 
assembled a retrospective cohort of 181,799 deceased donor kidneys recovered for transplantation 
from 2000-2013. We identified the impact of the day of the week on the procurement and

 subsequent utilization or discard of deceased donor kidneys in the United States, as well as report 
the geographic variation on the impact of weekends on transplantation. Compared to weekday 
kidneys, organs procured on weekends were significantly more likely to be discarded than 
transplanted (odds ratio: 1.16; 95% confidence interval 1.13 – 1.19), even after adjusting for organ 
quality (adjusted odds ratio: 1.13; 95% confidence interval 1.10 – 1.17). Weekend discards were of 
a significantly higher quality than weekday discards (kidney donor profile index: 76.5 vs 77.3%). 
Considerable geographic variation was noted in the proportion of transplants that occurred over 
the weekend. Kidneys available for transplant over the weekend were significantly more likely to 
be used at larger transplant centers, be shared without payback, and experienced shorter cold 
ischemia times. Thus, factors other than kidney quality are contributing to the discard of deceased 
donor kidneys, particularly during weekends. Policy prescriptions, administrative or organizational 
solutions within transplant programs may potentially mitigate against the recent increase in kidney 
discards.

INTRODUCTION
Weekends are traditionally a period of limited resources at hospitals and numerous studies 
have demonstrated the adverse impact of weekends on patient outcomes. For example, 
higher mortality rates have been observed among patients admitted on weekends for 
diagnoses where outcomes are associated with time-sensitive interventions, e.g. myocardial 
infarctions, strokes, and pulmonary embolism (1-5). Similar analyses for diagnoses requiring 
urgent surgery, such as ruptured aortic aneurysms, have also demonstrated inferior outcomes 
(6). Previous analyses have suggested that outcomes following kidney and liver transplants 
performed over the weekend are similar to transplants performed during the week (7-10). 
However, these analyses examined only the outcomes of organs that were procured and 
actually transplanted without accounting for the impact of organ selection.
Each year over 5,000 people die waiting for a kidney transplant while annually, nearly 2,700 
kidneys that are procured for transplantation are subsequently discarded (11). This high rate 
of discard is concerning especially given the worsening organ shortage in the United States 
(U.S.), yet the factors contributing to organ discard remain poorly understood. While the 
most commonly cited reason for organ discard is biopsy results (despite growing evidence 
that these findings are not predictive of outcomes), recent analyses suggest that even kidneys 
of acceptable quality are being discarded at an increasing rate (9, 10, 12). Poor donor kidney 
function, anatomic abnormalities and concern of donor medical/social history are other 
highly cited reasons for the discard of deceased donor kidneys procured for transplant(9, 13, 
14) . It is important to note that currently, no universal guidelines exist in the U.S. to 
recommend which kidneys should be utilized and which should be discarded. As result, we 
hypothesize that there is a significant degree of transplant center-to-center variability, 
suggesting that factors external to the donor organ, or recipient, may contribute to transplant 
centers’ decisions not to transplant an organ. However, whether or not resource limitations at

 transplant centers contribute to the discard of deceased donor kidneys has not been studied. 
In this study, our objective was to analyze whether the procurement and utilization of 
deceased donor kidneys in the U.S. varied by day of the week, specifically, if it was different 
on weekends when compared to weekdays.
RESULTS
In the U.S. from 2000 – 2013, approximately 202,000 deceased donor kidneys were 
available for procurement (n = 201,956), of which ~90% were procured for transplant (n = 
181,799; Table 1; eFigure 1). The number of deaths in the U.S. during that period varied by 
day of the week and peaked on Friday and Saturday (15). Similarly, the total number of 
kidneys available for procurement varied by day of the week but the highest numbers were 
available on Tuesdays (15.1%) and Wednesdays (15.1%) while the lowest numbers were 
available on Sunday and Monday (13.5 and 13.4%, respectively; Table 1). The average 
quality of kidneys available for procurement, as measured by the KDPI, also varied 
significantly by day of the week (p<0.001). Fridays were associated with the lowest rate of 
procurement of kidneys from the available donor pool (89.3%) and the procured kidneys had 
the highest average KDPI (value of 53.7%), i.e. the lowest quality, for kidneys procured on 
any single day of the week. In contrast, Sundays and Mondays were associated with having 
the highest rates of procurement of donor kidneys but these kidneys also had the lowest 
KDPI suggesting that the procured kidneys were of a significantly better quality on average 
(Table 1).
Nearly 80% of kidneys transplanted on the weekend were procured from deceased donors on 
Fridays and Saturdays (eTable 1). Kidneys procured on Fridays experienced the highest rate 
of organ discard for the week (Table 1). The rate of kidney procurement on Saturday was 
marginally higher than that seen on Friday (89.7 vs. 89.3%, p<0.001) while the discard rate 
for kidneys procured on Saturday (18.4%) was the second highest for the week after kidneys 
procured on Friday (18.8%). The discard rate was lowest on Monday and increased over the 
course of the week to peak on Friday (p<0.001; Table 1). The odds of discard of a kidney 
after procurement tended to increase over the course of the week (reference = Monday), i.e. 
as the weekend neared, there was an increase in the odds of discard for kidneys procured on 
Friday and Saturday (Figure 1; Table 2a). The quality of discards also showed an uptrend 
during the course of the week and peaked on Friday. As a result, the odds of kidney discard 
on Friday and Saturday remained significantly elevated even after adjustment for the KDPI 
(aOR = 1.19; 95 confidence interval [CI]: 1.13 – 1.26; p<0.001 and aOR = 1.18; 95% CI: 
1.11 – 1.24; p<0.001, respectively; Figure 1; Table 2a). The percentage of kidneys being 
shared without payback between donor service areas increased from Monday to a peak on 
Saturday (p=0.003; Table 1). Additionally, kidneys procured on weekends (Friday - 
Saturday) were more likely to be transplanted at larger transplant centers than kidneys 
procured on a weekday (Sunday – Thursday; p=0.037).
When considered together, kidneys procured on Friday and Saturday, i.e. kidneys available 
for transplant on the weekend, were much more likely to be discarded (18.6 vs. 16.4%, 
p<0.001); these discarded kidneys were more likely to be of a higher quality, i.e. lower 
KDPI, (76.5 vs 77.3%, p =0.018) than those discarded during the rest of the week (Table 1).

 Compared to weekday kidneys, organs procured for transplantation on weekends were 
approximately 1.2 times more likely to be discarded than transplanted (OR = 1.16; 95% CI: 
1.13 – 1.19; p<0.001), even after adjusting for organ quality (aOR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.10 – 
1.17;p<0.001); Table 2b). Kidneys available for transplant over the weekend were also more 
likely to be used at larger transplant centers (p = 0.037), be shared without payback (p = 
0.001), and experienced shorter cold ischemia times (p = 0.002; Table 1). However, the 
majority of transplanted kidneys, regardless of weekday period or day of the week 
distinction, were transplanted the day after they were procurement (eTable 2) resulting in 
relatively similar mean cold ischemia times (eTable 2).
Transplants performed on the weekend were not evenly distributed across the country 
(Figure 2). Uniform transplantation rates and preferences suggest that, on average, 28.6% 
(2/7) of all deceased donor kidney transplants in any large geographic area would occur on 
weekends or, though unlikely, that the proportion of total kidneys transplanted during that 
time period equaled the proportion of kidneys offered. Considerable geographic variation 
was noted in the proportion of transplants that occurred over the weekend (Figure 2). The 
Southeast (e.g. Arkansas, Alabama, South Carolina, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia) and 
Midwest (e.g. Minnesota, Iowa, Ohio) regions performed a greater than expected share of 
their deceased donor renal transplants on weekends. States located within the Rocky 
Mountain (e.g. Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and Nevada) and Southeast regions (e.g. Arizona 
and Oklahoma) performed the smallest share of their transplants on the weekend (28.58 – 
33.51% vs. 18.98 – 25.55%).
Due to the broad study period, covering 2000-2013, we also analyzed both the percentage of 
kidneys discarded and the odds of discard over three contiguous time periods (2000-2004, 
2005-2009 and 2010-2013; eFigure 2). Additionally, we examined whether the probability 
of discard by day of the week was observed across time (eFigure 3). Both sub-analyses 
confirmed that the observed phenomena were not limited to only a part of the study period. 
Recent studies have also suggested that kidney discard is on the rise, following the 
introduction of the new kidney allocation system in the U.S. in 2014 (16).
A sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the impact of adjusting our logistic 
regression models, shown in Table 2, for the 10 individual components of the KDPI measure 
(e.g. donor age, weight, height, serum creatinine, etc.) instead of the KDPI summary 
measure. The coefficient estimate for the primary exposure (day of the week) and outcome 
(discard) relationship was not significantly altered when comparing both approaches and are 
shown in eTable 3).
DISCUSSION
Weekends are classically associated with limitations on resource availability and appear to 
negatively impact outcomes for several conditions.(1, 3-5) Outcomes following 
transplantation over the weekend appear to be a notable exception to these phenomena (7, 
8). However, since organ transplantation has a potentially elective component that requires 
acceptance of an organ by the medical/surgical team, outcomes of transplants performed

 over the weekend may be biased by potential differences in selection criteria between 
weekdays and weekends.
Our analysis demonstrates a temporal trend during the week for procurement and discard of 
kidneys, as well as utilization patterns that reflect how organs are distributed and where they 
are utilized. We also demonstrated a dramatic adverse impact of weekends on the 
procurement of, and subsequent discard of, kidneys from deceased donors that were 
determined to be transplantable at the time of procurement. Kidneys that were procured but 
not subsequently transplanted over the weekend appear to be of higher quality than kidneys 
that were procured and similarly discarded during the weekday, suggesting that factors 
beyond the quality of the kidney were influencing the decision to accept/decline the offer of 
a deceased donor kidney. This finding, coupled with the increased utilization of deceased 
donor kidneys at large transplant centers on the weekend, would suggest the contribution of 
resource limitations that often occur on weekends is a contributing factor. Large transplant 
centers tend to have more resources, including manpower, and while they may also 
experience resource constraints over the weekend, the impact may be smaller.
Notably, cold ischemia times for transplanted organs on the weekend were shorter than they 
were during the weekday, suggesting perhaps an awareness of the increased difficultly in 
organ acceptance during the weekend and the development of organ offer strategies to 
mitigate this effect. Alternatively, transplant centers may use lower thresholds for cold 
ischemia time for accepting a deceased donor kidney over the weekend . For example, 
centers that routinely accept kidneys with long cold ischemia time and are willing to accept 
the attendant increased risk of delayed graft function may be less willing to do so on 
weekends if there are resource limitations that limit the availability of hemodialysis post-
operatively. Additionally, we hypothesize that limited surgical manpower on weekends may 
be a contributing factor, particularly for smaller transplant programs. Surgeons may have to 
cover multiple services (e.g. liver and kidney), perform organ procurements, and deal with 
emergencies without the luxury of other attending transplant surgeons for backup on 
weekends. This may result in an increased reluctance, if not a complete inability to accept 
organs for transplant during these periods. Increased rates of decline at transplant centers on 
the weekend may also contribute to longer cold ischemia times accrued on kidneys while 
attempting to place them, which in turn would adversely affect the likelihood of organ 
acceptance even at centers with less stringent acceptance criteria. Geographic variation in 
the percentage of decreased donor transplants that occur on the weekend would suggest 
systemic factors are contributing to the acceptance/decline of kidneys for transplantation. 
While center specific resource allocation issues adversely impact organ acceptance on the 
weekends, transplant surgeons who are engaged in significant elective non-transplant 
surgeries during the work week may find themselves more willing or able to accept organ 
offers on the weekend for transplant resulting in centers that do a greater than expected share 
of their transplants on the weekend.
While there are many strengths of our study, our analysis has some of the limitations that are 
inherent in observational studies analyzing registry data. First, while SRTR data captures 
reason for organ discard and disposition, the reporting is subjective. In addition, certain 
organ and transplant center-level characteristics, such as cold ischemia time for discarded

 organs, detailed kidney biopsy findings and a center's academic affiliation, were not 
available in the data set. Thus, the contributions of these factors to organ discard were not 
measurable in our analysis. Also, although the KDPI has been validated as a reasonable 
measure of deceased donor organ quality in the U.S., it is an imperfect measure with only 
moderate predictive power (KDPI c-statistic = 0.60). The KDPI, as currently formulated, 
does not include certain organ characteristics that would influence the ability to use the 
organ such as anatomical abnormalities, injury during procurement or even biopsy findings 
when a biopsy is performed. Lastly, because the SRTR dataset does not include a precise 
date/time that a kidney is discarded, we chose to define weekend kidneys as organs that 
would have been transplanted on the weekend rather than those procured on the weekend. 
Deceased donor kidneys are often transplanted with more than 24 hours of cold storage and 
as a result, the majority of kidneys procured for transplantation are transplanted on the 
following day (eTable 1). Thus, most kidneys transplanted on the weekend (Saturday/
Sunday) are procured on Friday or Saturday.
In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates a variation in procurement and discard rates that 
vary over the course of the week and strongly suggest that deceased donor kidneys are more 
likely to be discarded over the weekend independent of organ quality. This suggests that 
organizational and systemic factors that extend beyond the quality of the available organ 
appear to be contributing to the high rate of discard of kidneys from deceased donors in the 
U.S. Further investigation into the short- and long-term outcomes of recipients transplanted 
at centers that are high weekend utilizers, could potentially provide an opportunity for 
quality improvement efforts, as well as changes in policy, to improve organ utilization.
METHODS
Study design and participants
This observational cohort study used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant 
Recipients (SRTR) and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), 2000-2013. The 
SRTR data system includes data on all donor, wait-listed candidates, and transplant 
recipients in the U.S., submitted by the members of the Organ Procurement and 
Transplantation Network (OPTN). The Health Resources and Services Administration 
(HRSA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provides oversight to the activities 
of the OPTN and SRTR contractors. The STROBE guidelines were used to ensure the 
reporting of this observational study (17).
We utilized the SRTR standard analytical file (2014 Quarter 1) to conduct a retrospective 
cohort study to analyze variation in kidney procurement and utilization during the calendar 
week (Monday–Sunday) from 2000 to 2013 and measure the impact of weekends, i.e. 
periods traditionally associated with lower resource availability. After including only 
deceased donor transplants and excluding donors and recipients <18 years in age, we 
identified a cohort of 201,956 deceased donor kidneys. For our analysis, we excluded 
kidneys from donors for whom we were unable to calculate the Kidney Donor Profile Index 
(KDPI; n=306) such as those with missing height or serum creatinine data. Kidneys of 
donors with a BMI greater than 50 (n=1,338) were also excluded due to concerns about the 
validity of anthropometric measurements that could affect the KDPI calculations.

 Given that nearly 80% (78.7%) of the organs used for kidney transplants performed on the 
weekend were procured on Friday and Saturday (eTable 1), we defined weekend kidneys as 
those that were procured for transplant on either a Friday or Saturday and subsequently 
discarded. We measured organ quality by calculating the KDPI, which is currently part of 
the new OPTN allocation policy for kidneys in the U.S. The KDPI is derived from the 
Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI), a measure used to estimate the relative risk of post-
transplant kidney graft failure. The KDRI is calculated using 10 donor specific 
characteristics (age, height, weight, ethnicity, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, 
cause of death, serum creatinine, HCV status, and donation after cardiac death (DCD) 
status) and has been validated as a reasonable measure of organ quality in the U.S. as well as 
in other developed countries (15, 18-21). After calculating the KDRI score, we mapped the 
values onto a cumulative percentage scale to create the KDPI. Because our analysis 
identified kidneys recovered from 2000 to 2013, as described by the OPTN, the KDRI was 
scaled to the median donor from 2013(15). Large transplant centers were defined as those 
that performed, on average, ≥100 living or deceased donor transplants per year over the 
duration of the study.
Geographic variation in the percentage of transplants that occurred on the weekends was 
estimated using the national OPTN Standard Transplant Analysis and Research (STAR) file 
(based on OPTN data as of June 30, 2014). The spatial representation of the proportion of 
weekend transplants is limited to recipients whose state of residence was known as of June 
2014.
Statistical analysis
Pearson's chi-square tests and the nonparametric Wilcoxon or Kruskal-Wallis tests were 
performed for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Chi-square tests were used 
to test equality of distribution between days of the week. We used univariate and 
multivariable logistic regression models to identify the odds of discard (vs. transplant) of 
kidneys procurement on different days of the week. The purposeful selection algorithm (PS) 
was used to evaluate confounding and establish which covariates were included in our 
regression models. We investigated effect measure modification by transplant center size and 
kidney procurement era on the relationship between day of the week organ procurement and 
discard. An interaction term approach, as well as the likelihood ratio test, was used to 
evaluate the effect medication. Transplant, recipient and donor characteristics were viewed 
as being potential model parameters. Univariate analysis of each potential covariate was 
performed; any variable having a significant univariate test, based on the Wald test from 
logistic regression using a p-value cut-off of 0.25, was considered a potential candidate for 
the multivariable analysis (22, 23). Known clinical relevance also contributed to the final 
selection of model parameters.
Prior to our analysis, the model assumptions for logistic regression testing were evaluated 
and met (including that there was linearity in the logit for the KDPI measure (the only 
continuous variable in our model and the lack of strongly influence outliers). Our final 
regression models adjusted the KDPI summary measure. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis 
was performed to understand the impact of adjusting models by the 10 components of the

 KDPI measure instead of the KDPI summary measure. Analyses were performed using SAS 
9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and Stata MP 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, 
USA). Post-covariate selection, statistical significance was identified by a p-value <0.05.
