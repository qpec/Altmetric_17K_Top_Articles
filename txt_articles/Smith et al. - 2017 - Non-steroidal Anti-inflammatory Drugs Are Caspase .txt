SUMMARY
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
among the most commonly used drugs in the world.
While the role of NSAIDs as cyclooxygenase (COX)
inhibitors is well established, other targets may
contribute to anti-inflammation. Here we report cas-
pases as a new pharmacological target for NSAID
family drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketor-
olac at physiologic concentrations both in vitro and
in vivo. We characterize caspase activity in both
in vitro and in cell culture, and combine computa-
tional modeling and biophysical analysis to deter-
mine the mechanism of action. We observe that
inhibition of caspase catalysis reduces cell death
and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Further,
NSAID
inhibition
of
caspases
is
COX
independent, representing a new anti-inflammatory
mechanism. This finding expands upon existing
NSAID anti-inflammatory behaviors, with implica-
tions for patient safety and next-generation drug
design.
INTRODUCTION
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among
the most prevalent pharmaceuticals in the world, with an esti-
mated 30 billion doses taken annually in the United States
alone (Green, 2001; Ong et al., 2007). The anti-inflammatory
properties of NSAIDs have been segued into analgesic and
anti-pyretic treatments targeting conditions ranging from mild
aches and pains to rheumatoid arthritis to cancer (Ricciotti
and FitzGerald, 2011). The best-characterized anti-inflamma-
tory properties of NSAIDs stem from inhibition of cyclooxyge-
nase (COX) isoenzymes (Gierse et al., 1999; Vane, 1971).
COX inhibition reduces the production of prostaglandins, which
are lipid autacoids involved in diverse cellular processes such
as angiogenesis, apoptosis, and cell migration (Ricciotti and
FitzGerald, 2011). However, much remains unclear about the
existence and contributions of additional NSAID targets (Loun-
kine et al., 2012). These targets may contribute to NSAID anti-
inflammatory mechanisms, applications, and the occurrence of
adverse drug reactions (Lounkine et al., 2012). Reported
NSAID functions include inhibition of nuclear factor kB, inhibi-
tion of proteasome function, activation of intrinsic and extrinsic
pathways of apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and activation of
stress kinases (Jana, 2008; Leibowitz et al., 2014). However,
many of these effects are seen only at superphysiological con-
centrations, limiting their biological relevance (Ghosh et al.,
2015; Mehlisch and Sykes, 2013). Here, we have identified
cysteine-aspartic proteases (caspases) as novel targets for
some NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketorolac at
physiologic concentrations. During inflammation, these NSAIDs
inhibit caspase catalytic activity, reducing cell death and the
induction of inflammatory cytokines.
Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that cleave
peptide substrates after aspartic acid. Conserved from meta-
zoans to humans, caspases play crucial roles in cell death, differ-
entiation, and inflammation (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2012). Initiator
caspases (caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10) contain large prodomains
for recruitment into multi-protein complexes, such as inflam-
masomes and apoptosomes. Upon activation, initiator cas-
pases will be proteolytically activated and subsequently activate
executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7), resulting in immu-
nologically silent cell death through apoptosis (Lamkanfi, 2011).
The aptly named inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, -4, and -5)
generate biologically active cytokines such as IL-1b and IL-18,
and induce pyroptotic cell death (Kayagaki et al., 2011; Shi
et al., 2014; Thornberry and Molineaux, 1995). Due to the impor-
tant role of caspases in inflammation and disease, it is essential
to understand the contributions of caspase inhibition in NSAID
pharmacology.
While previous research has observed pro-apoptotic and
chemoprotective NSAID behaviors, these studies were not con-
ducted under inflammatory conditions, which are more relevant
to patient physiology (Jana, 2008; Leibowitz et al., 2014). This
approach masks the independent contributions of caspases,
which are upregulated under inflammatory conditions, and
suggests that environment may affect the NSAID anti-inflamma-
tory mechanism. In the presence of inflammatory stimuli, cas-
pase activation propagates inflammation through the release of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and danger-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs) from dying cells (Creagh, 2014). Consequen-
tially, caspase inhibition by NSAIDs will reduce inflammation.
However, this behavior is a double-edged sword, as the reduc-
tion of cytokines and DAMPs is paired with prevention of bene-
ficial apoptosis. Armed with an expanded understanding of

 how caspase inhibition affects NSAID pharmacology, it may be
possible to improve patient safety and account for the occur-
rence of negative side effects. As caspases are an attractive
therapeutic target in their own right, it is also feasible that drug
repurposing could expand applications of some NSAIDs. Cas-
pases have known roles in cancer, cardiovascular disease, rheu-
matoid arthritis, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases
(McIlwain et al., 2013).
Here, we identify a novel role for NSAID family drugs such
as ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketorolac as caspase inhibitors.
At physiologically relevant concentrations, numerous NSAIDs
impede caspase catalysis, reducing inflammation and cell death.
Through study of COX-deficient cells and a Caenorhabditis
elegans model we have determined that caspase inhibition is
COX independent, and represents a new NSAID anti-inflamma-
tory target. As caspases play a pivotal role in inflammation and
cell death, inhibition could contribute to the NSAID anti-inflam-
matory mechanism and inform patient safety.
RESULTS
High-Throughput Screening Identifies NSAIDs as
Caspase-4 Inhibitors
Caspase-4 is an exciting new innate immune receptor because,
unlike other caspases, caspase-4 is able to directly bind its
cognate ligand, lipopolysaccharide (Shi et al., 2014). Caspase-4
inhibitors have promising anti-inflammatory applications in sep-
tic shock treatment; however, to date no caspase-4 small-mole-
cule inhibitors have been developed (Hagar et al., 2013; Smith
et al., 2015). Further, recent efforts in drug repurposing and
computational analysis have identified a myriad of previously un-
known targets for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
pharmaceuticals (Ashburn and Thor, 2004; Lounkine et al.,
2012). To this end, we aimed to use high-throughput screening
to identify therapeutic inhibitors of caspase-4 enzymatic activity.
We screened the 1,280 compound Prestwick Chemical Library,
which
is
comprised
of
FDA-approved
bioavailable
drugs
selected for chemical and pharmacological diversity (Figure S1).
Screening at 33 mM yielded 27 compounds that reduced cas-
pase-4 catalytic activity to less than 25%, a 2% hit rate (Table 1).
Due to the nature of the Promega Caspase-Glo-coupled enzyme
screen, these hits included known luciferase inhibitors, such as
resveratrol and AMP. Interestingly, NSAIDs comprised half of
the hits, and eight of the top ten most potent inhibitors. Hits
were not limited to one NSAID class (e.g., propionic acid class),
and are structurally diverse. This was intriguing because, while
caspases and COX share interrelated signaling, the enzymes
themselves are largely dissimilar. Further, earlier studies aiming
to observe NSAID off-target effects would not detect contribu-
tions from caspases, which are upregulated only in an inflamma-
tory environment (Hagar et al., 2013; Jana, 2008).
Despite the prevalence of NSAIDs as caspase-4 inhibitors, not
all of the NSAIDs screened reduced enzymatic activity (Table
S1). To ascertain the chemical properties that contribute to cas-
pase inhibitory activity, we performed a principal-component
analysis (PCA) using ChemGPS. This tool uses t scores from
PCA to compare NSAIDs in terms of physical-chemical proper-
ties such as size, aromaticity, polarity, and flexibility (Larsson
et al., 2007). From this evaluation of chemical space and its rela-
tionship to caspase inhibition, several trends emerged (Figures
S2A–S2D). The primary determinants were observed to be com-
pound size, shape, and polarizability (correlation coefficient
0.72). While aromaticity was not a factor, extremes in polarity
or hydrophobicity were not tolerated, and increased flexibility
discouraged binding (correlation coefficient 0.39). For example,
exceptionally polar compounds such as oxicam-class NSAIDs
or lipophilic compounds such as coxib-class NSAIDs are unable
to inhibit caspase-4. These factors are consistent with known
caspase active-site inhibitors. The NSAID size restriction mirrors
existing caspase inhibitors that often contain small core scaf-
folds (Poreba et al., 2015). It may be that larger NSAIDs are inca-
pable of fitting into the S1 pocket, and are unable to compensate
by forming sufficient contacts with the rest of the active site (Fig-
ure S2E). Further, at the P1 position, there is a nearly inalienable
preference for aspartic acid, and the S1 pocket is narrow and
extremely electropositive (Wei et al., 2000). Thus, extremely hy-
drophobic or charged NSAIDs would be unfavorable binding
partners. Additionally, many NSAIDs contain a carboxylic acid
that could form hydrogen bonds with the S1 pocket, mimicking
aspartic acid.
From the numerous NSAIDs considered thus far, nine com-
pounds (fenbufen, indoprofen, ketoprofen, ketorolac, felbinac,
tiaprofenic, aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) were selected
to further examine the effect of NSAIDs on caspase catalytic
activity. These compounds represent diverse NSAID classes,
scaffolds, sizes, polarities, rigidities, and caspase-4 inhibitory
potencies in order to provide a broad-scope assessment.
NSAIDs Are Multi-caspase Inhibitors
The caspase enzyme family is subdivided by their function as
inflammatory, initiator, or executioner caspases, or segregated
by recognition of particular tetrapeptide substrates (Garcia-
Calvo et al., 1998; Thornberry, 1998). Despite these functional
differences, caspases are structurally analogous, posing a chal-
lenge for chemical targeting of individual caspases (Poreba et al.,
2015; Wei et al., 2000). To explore NSAID specificity, we assayed
the catalytic activity of caspases-1, -3, -4, -5, and -9 (Figure 1).
These caspases were selected to represent inflammatory, initi-
ator, and executioner caspases with diverse tetrapeptide sub-
strates. Inhibition was not specific to caspase-4, as NSAIDs
reduced catalysis of multiple caspases (Table 2). Aspirin is a
notable exception, with no inhibitory properties. However,
aspirin has a unique acetylation mechanism that will not affect
caspase catalysis (Lecomte et al., 1994).
Multi-caspase inhibition suggests that NSAIDs are primarily
binding to a conserved subsite such as S1. In general, NSAID
inhibition was more pronounced for caspases-4, -5, and -9,
with weaker activity against caspases-3 and -1. This may
be due to differences in the substrate recognition pocket, as
caspases-4, -5, and -9 all recognize the LEHD tetrapeptide,
whereas caspase-1 recognizes WEHD and caspase-3 DEVD. It
is feasible that interactions with the adjacent but less-conserved
S2 and S10 subsites account for the small differences in activity
observed (Poreba et al., 2013; Talanian et al., 1997).
We

 proteases and ruling out the presence of redox cycling com-
pounds (RCCs) (Figure S3A). RCCs generate hydrogen peroxide
in the presence of strong reducing agents, and indirectly inhibit
enzyme activity through oxidation of the catalytic cysteine (John-
ston, 2011). We also accounted for luciferase inhibition, although
NSAIDs have been widely tested in luciferase-based assays
(Figure S3B). We did not observe inhibition of luciferase or
cathepsin B, suggesting that NSAID inhibition is specific to the
caspase family. This finding links NSAIDs to a class of enzymes
with known roles in cancer, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, and neurodegenerative diseases (McIlwain et al., 2013).
NSAIDs Are Competitive Inhibitors
We next sought to further characterize the interaction between
NSAIDs and various caspases. To assess binding, we observed
caspase-3 tryptophan fluorescence. Caspase-3 was selected
because it has two active-site tryptophan residues (Trp206 and
Trp214) that provide information on the active-site microenvi-
ronment (Kyoung et al., 2002). We observed quenching of cas-
pase-3 tryptophan fluorescence with indoprofen titration, giving
an apparent KD of 30 ± 2 mM (Figure 2A). Aspirin quenched with a
substantially weaker apparent KD of 1290 ± 10 mM. The disparate
binding affinities of these two NSAIDs corroborates the rank
order observed in our enzymatic data.
The hypothesized binding interaction was further explored
with computational modeling and enzymatic competition as-
says. Computational docking over the entire caspase-3 surface
places indoprofen and fenbufen in the caspase-3 S1 subsite,
obscuring the substrate binding pocket at the catalytic cysteine
(Figures 2B–2D) (Ganesan et al., 2006; Grosdidier et al., 2011a).
This localization would suggest that NSAIDs act as competi-
tive inhibitors. The S1 subsite is the most conserved, reflecting
the strict requirement for aspartic acid at the P1 position.
NSAIDs binding to this highly conserved site would not confer
caspase specificity, in agreement with the multi-caspase ac-
tivity observed. The carboxylic acid moiety of indoprofen and
fenbufen is able to form hydrogen bonds (Arg64, Arg207, and
Gln161) mimicking the aspartic acid substrate. This hypothesis

Compounds identified by high-throughput screening (HTS) that reduced caspase-4 catalytic activity to less than 25% were considered to be hits. In-
formation on the therapeutic categories for each compound was obtained from drugs.com. Values shown represent the average of two independent
replicates. Due to the nature of the Promega Caspase-Glo 9 coupled-enzyme system, luciferase inhibitors will also appear as false positives. Known
luciferase inhibitors are denoted with asterisks, including resveratrol and AMP. Data are reported to three significant figures. See also Figure S1 for HTS

 was experimentally validated with a substrate competition
assay. At increasing substrate concentrations, the observed
half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value increases,
consistent with inhibitor and substrate competing for the same
site (Table S2).
Conversely, despite the presence of a carboxylic acid, aspirin
does not preferentially dock to the active site (Figure 2E). Taken
together with the observed caspase inhibition, these results
suggest that NSAIDs may be competitive caspase inhibitors
recognizing the active site.
NSAIDs Are Physiologically Relevant Caspase Inhibitors
We next studied inhibition of caspases by NSAIDs in a cellular
context. With NSAID treatment between 0 and 500 mM, we
observed dose-dependent inhibition of caspase-3 catalytic
activity in HeLa cells (Figures 3A and S3C). Consistent with
the in vitro observation of multi-caspase targeting, we observed
multi-caspase inhibition with caspases-1, -3, and -9 when HeLa
and THP-1 cells were treated with 100 mM of NSAIDs (Figures
3B–3D). In addition to these direct measurements of catalysis,
we also assessed cell viability and IL-1b production as hallmarks
of caspase signaling. THP-1 cells treated with up to 500 mM of
NSAIDs demonstrated improved viability when challenged with
the apoptosis inducers nigericin or staurosporine (Figures 4A
and S3D). As caspase activity culminates in cell death, this is
consistent with a reduction of caspase catalysis. In further sup-
port of caspase-1 inhibition, we also observed a decrease in
IL-1b production in NSAID-treated cells (Figure 4B). Caspase-1
cleaves pro-IL-1b to its mature secreted form, thus caspase-1
inhibition halts cytokine release and subsequent inflammation.
Importantly, across all the different assays the NSAID rank order
is maintained, with fenbufen and indoprofen displaying substan-
tial inhibitory capabilities, while naproxen and ibuprofen are
weak inhibitors, and aspirin is ineffective.
Unlike previously identified NSAID targets observed only at
high doses (mM), caspase inhibition occurs at micromolar
concentrations in biological systems, consistent with physio-
logical levels of NSAIDs (5–500 mM), and comparable with
the IC50 values for COX (Ghosh et al., 2015; Gierse et al.,
1999; Kato et al., 2001; Piazza et al., 1997). While inhibition
is not comparable with that of potent, irreversible pan-caspase
inhibitors such as z-VAD-FMK, at physiological concentrations
caspase inhibition by NSAIDs may still have unforeseen effects
on patients.
Caspase Inhibition by NSAIDs Is COX Independent
As inflammatory signaling has extensive crosstalk, it is difficult to
parse out the individual contributions of caspase and COX inhi-
bition by NSAIDs in a biological system. We explored the COX
dependence of caspase inhibition in HCT116 cells, which lack
COX-2. HCT116 cells treated with 10 mM staurosporine and
100 mM of NSAIDs demonstrated comparable inhibition with
Figure 1. NSAIDs Are Multi-Caspase Inhibitors

caspase-3 in pink, caspase-4 in red, caspase-5 in green, and caspase-9 in blue. The associated IC50 values are available in Table 2. 100% = substrate with
solvent, 0% = z-VAD-FMK. Data are representative of the average and SD of at least two independent replicates.

 that observed in HeLa and THP-1 cells (Figure 5A). This finding is
supported by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knock down of COX-
2 and caspase-3 in HeLa cells. Knock down of COX-2 did not
alter the caspase-3 response, indicating that the caspase catal-
ysis assay is not contingent on COX-2 activity (Figure S4).
We further investigated NSAID treatments in the model
organism C. elegans, in which the caspase homolog cell death
proteins play a central role in apoptosis. C. elegans is an excel-
lent model as apoptotic machinery is highly conserved, but lacks
expression of either COX isoform (Lesa et al., 2003; Yuan et al.,
1993). We performed cell death analysis using the ced-1(e1735)
mutant that is defective in the cell corpse engulfment process,
which sensitized the cell death assay (Conradt et al., 2016;
Nakagawa et al., 2010). With 100 mM fenbufen or indoprofen
treatment, we observed a statistically significant decrease of
cell death starting at 2-fold, whereas 0.5% DMSO did not cause
any effect (Figures 5B and S4C). This assay presents an in vivo
COX-independent model for NSAID inhibition of caspases. While
both pathways will be simultaneously affected in patients, cas-
pase inhibition is a previously unacknowledged avenue that
likely contributes to NSAID pharmacology.
DISCUSSION
Here we report a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism for NSAIDs
such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketorolac. We observe that
these NSAIDs are competitive caspase inhibitors, binding to
the S1 subsite and obscuring the catalytic cysteine. Unlike
previously identified non-COX NSAID targets, caspase inhibition
is observed at physiological concentrations up to 500 mM. The
caspase inhibitory profile is comparable in potency to COX,
with micromolar IC50 values (Gierse et al., 1999; Kato et al.,
2001; Piazza et al., 1997). We also observe that caspase inhibi-
tion is COX independent, implicating a novel pathway for NSAID
pharmacology in patients. At physiological concentrations, it
is likely that both COX and caspase pathways are simulta-
neously modulated, each contributing to the anti-inflammatory
mechanism.
We propose that caspase contributions are relevant to the
NSAID anti-inflammatory mechanism of action by reducing cell
death and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. How-
ever, despite the beneficial anti-inflammatory results of caspase
inhibition, the possible detriments should not be discounted.
Reducing healthy caspase signaling increases the incidence of
viral and bacterial infection, and deregulates inflammation and
cell proliferation (Guo et al., 2015; McIlwain et al., 2013). Interest-
ingly, we observed a trend between the potency of caspase inhi-
bition and drug recall and incidence of side effects. For example,
fenbufen and indoprofen have been largely recalled from global
markets due to liver and gastrointestinal toxicity (Fung et al.,
2001; Lewis and Stine, 2013). However, aspirin, ibuprofen, and
naproxen remain prevalent, and demonstrate weaker caspase in-
hibition. Future efforts should look to further explore how caspase
inhibition by NSAIDs affects patients. Drug repurposing may
expand NSAID applicability to caspase-focused pharmacological

IC50 values were determined for each NSAID and caspase combination.
NSAIDs were tested from 66 mM to 26.1 nM to obtain a dose-response
curve. Aspirin shows no inhibition against any caspase at the concentra-
tions tested; however, all other tested NSAIDs demonstrate caspase in-
hibition. NSAIDs with no inhibition up to 66 mM are denoted as no activity,
while weak inhibitors have an IC50 value > 66 mM. The associated dose-
response curves are available in the supplemental information. NA, not
applicable.

arthritis, and neurodegenerative diseases. An improved under-
standing of how caspases control the NSAID anti-inflammatory
mechanism may lead to the design of more specific drugs, and
improve patient safety.

 drugs, we have identified a subset of NSAIDs capable of
inhibiting caspases at physiological concentrations. In vitro
characterization obtained IC50 values with multiple cas-
pases,
representing
wide
applicability
against
diverse
biological functions and substrates. Principal-component
analysis examined NSAID chemical space, and identified
compound size as the discerning factor for inhibition. We
explored
active-site
binding
interactions
with
trypto-
phan quenching, substrate competition, and computational
modeling. Further, we examined the biological context of
this work through cell culture and C. elegans animal models.
Here we observed a non-canonical NSAIDs mechanism
that is COX independent, establishing caspases as a novel
pharmacological target.

 While extensive effort has been invested in the study of
NSAIDs, previous research linking NSAIDs to apoptosis
was not conducted under inflammatory conditions. In these
circumstances, the contribution of caspases would not
be apparent, as these important enzymes are upregulated
only under inflammatory conditions. Further, many studies
are conducted at superphysiologic NSAID concentrations,
and may not be relevant to patients. By measuring caspase
signaling at physiologic concentrations under inflammatory
conditions, we were able to observe a novel role for NSAIDs.
Understanding how additional targets may contribute to
NSAID pharmacology could clarify the anti-inflammatory
mechanism, improve patient safety, and facilitate the design
of next-generation therapeutics.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Protein Expression and Purification
For high-throughput screening, a caspase-4 C258A catalytically inactive
mutant was expressed using a modified pET vector, which was generously
gifted by Dr. Feng Shao (Shi et al., 2014). To obtain the catalytically active
mutant, a New England Biolabs Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit was
used to revert the catalytically inactive caspase-4 to an active form with
cysteine at site 258. Caspase-3 (pET23b-Casp3-His Addgene no. 11821)
and caspase-9 (pET23b-Casp9-His Addgene no. 11829) were gifts from
Dr. Guy Salvesen (Stennicke et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 1997). Proteins were
expressed and purified using the protocol described previously by Denault
and Salvesen (2002). Briefly, plasmids were expressed in E. coli BL21 pLysS
cells and grown in 23 tryptone yeast culture medium at 18�C overnight after
induction with 50 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were
then pelleted and sonicated to collect the lysate, and purified using Nickel
NTA Agarose Beads (Gold Bio). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
For IC50 determination, caspase-1, -4, and -5 were purchased from Enzo
Life Sciences.
High-Throughput Screening
High-throughput screening for inhibitors of human caspase-4 was performed
using the 1280 compound Prestwick Chemical Library at the University of
Colorado High-Throughput Screening Core Facility. The screen was designed
in a 384-well format (Greiner no. 781207), using 33 mM compound, 1 mM re-
combinant human caspase-4 in high-citrate buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5],
1 M sodium citrate, 10 mM DTT, and 10% sucrose), and 20 mM Promega
Caspase-Glo 9 Assay substrate (O’Brien et al., 2005; Roschitzki-Voser et al.,
2012). While designed for use with caspase-9, the LEHD substrate is also
recognized by caspase-4 (Roschitzki-Voser et al., 2012; Talanian et al.,
1997). The assay Z0 factor is 0.66, recommending this method for high-
throughput experimentation (Figure S1) (Zhang et al., 1999). Plates were
read with endpoint luminescent analysis 20 and 60 min after substrate
addition. Compounds were considered to be hits if caspase-4 activity was
inhibited to less than 25% relative to the solvent control. Using these criteria,
we identified 27 hits, which are summarized in Table 1. Fenbufen, indoprofen,
ketoprofen, ketorolac, felbinac, naproxen, ibuprofen, and tiaprofenic were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Aspirin was purchased from TCI America.
z-VAD-FMK was obtained from InvivoGen.
Caspase Catalytic Activity, IC50 Determination, and Specificity
To assess the potency and specificity of each NSAID, IC50 values were deter-
mined against caspases-1, -3, -4, -5, and -9. Experiments were performed in a
384-well format (Greiner no. 781207) as per the conditions noted here.
Caspase-1: 2.5 nM enzyme, 6.5 mM WEHD substrate, ECB
Caspase-3: 200 nM enzyme, 3.3 mM DEVD substrate, SCB
Caspase-4: 1 nM enzyme, 10 mM LEHD substrate, HCB
Caspase-5: 20 nM enzyme, 10 mM LEHD substrate, HCB
Caspase-9: 200 nM enzyme, 6.5 mM LEHD substrate, HCB
ECB (Enzo Caspase Buffer): 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5%
Tween 20, 10 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol
SCB (Standard Caspase Buffer): 20 mM PIPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, and 10% sucrose
HCB (High-Citrate Buffer): 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 M sodium citrate,
10 mM DTT, and 10% sucrose
Substrate was present in at least 16-fold excess, and enzyme concentra-
tions were kept well below IC50. Activity was measured as the change in lumi-
nescent signal for at least 30 min. Analysis was performed using the linear
portion of the curve; however, endpoint analysis yielded values within error.
Percent inhibition was determined compared with the DMSO-only control.
Each assay included solvent and z-VAD-FMK controls. Compounds were
tested between 26.1 nM and 66 mM to obtain a dose-response curve. Higher

 concentrations were not tested since higher DMSO concentrations (>1%)
decreased luminescence. IC50 values were calculated using OriginPro 2016
using a dose-response curve with a variable Hill slope, where A1 and A2 repre-
sent the asymptotes, p is the Hill slope, and Logx0 is the center.
y = A1 +

The asymptotes were fixed at 100% and 0% to represent the solvent and
z-VAD-FMK controls, respectively. Data shown are the average and SD of at
least two technical replicates repeated in two independent assays.
Cathepsin B Catalytic Activity
Recombinant human liver cathepsin B was obtained from Enzo Life Sciences.
NSAID inhibition of cathepsin B was tested in a 384-well format (Greiner no.
781209) in buffer containing 352 mM KH2PO4, 48 mM Na2HPO4, 4 mM
EDTA, 8 mM cysteine, and 0.1% Triton X at pH 6.0 with 66 mM of compound
(Barrett, 1980). Cathepsin B was assayed at 75 nM with 2.5 mM z-Arg-
Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin hydrochloride (Z-RR-AMC) (Sigma-Aldrich).
N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Methional (ALLM) from BioVision Technologies was used
at 1 mM as an inhibitory control. Data shown are the average and SD of at least
three technical replicates repeated in three independent assays (n = 9).
Data were normalized such that cathepsin B with solvent is 100%, and 0%
as ALLM inhibitor.
Caspase Catalytic Activity in Cultured Cells
HeLa (human epithelial) and HCT 116 (human colon) cells from ATCC were
cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin were plated at 10,000 cells/well in a white 96-well plate (Greiner
no. 655083) and grown overnight. THP-1 (human peripheral blood monocyte)
cells from ATCC were grown in RPMI with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/strep-
tomycin, and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. THP-1 cells were plated at
25,000 cells/well in a white 96-well plate and differentiated with 10 ng/mL
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) overnight. The day after plating the cell cul-
ture medium was replaced. THP-1 cells were primed for 4 hr with 1 mg/mL
E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (InvivoGen). HeLa and HCT 116 cells
were not primed. Cells were then treated with 1 or 10 mM staurosporine
(Sigma-Aldrich) or 1 mM nigericin (InvivoGen) and the indicated concentration
of inhibitor (Locovei et al., 2007; Mariathasan et al., 2006; Omura et al., 1977;
Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2007; Tamaoki et al., 1986). After incubation,
caspase-1 (2 hr incubation, Promega Caspase-Glo 1 Inflammasome Assay),
caspase-3 (4 hr incubation, Promega Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay), or caspase-9
(4 hr incubation, or Promega Caspase-Glo 9 Assay) activity was assayed per
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Data were normalized with 10 mg/mL
z-VAD-FMK as 0% caspase activity, and staurosporine or nigericin as 100%
activation. Data shown are the average and SD of at least three biological
replicates. Statistical significance was determined using a one-way ANOVA
test followed by Tukey’s test to compare compound treated with nigericin
or staurosporine only.
Cell Viability Determination
THP-1 cells were cultured and plated as above in a 96-well black plate (Greiner
no. 655086). THP-1 cells were differentiated for 3 days with PMA. Apoptosis
was induced using 10 mM staurosporine or 25 mM nigericin, and viability was
measured after 2 hr using the Promega CellTiter-Fluor Viability Assay as per
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Additionally, the Promega CellTiter-
Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay was used to assess compound toxicity
and observe luciferase inhibition. Data were normalized using untreated cells
as 100% viability and staurosporine or nigericin cells as 0%. For CellTiter-Glo,
0% is lysed cells. Data shown are the average and SD of at least three bio-
logical replicates. Statistical significance was determined using a one-way
ANOVA test followed by Tukey’s test to compare the compound treated
with nigericin or staurosporine only.
ELISA
THP-1 cells were plated in a 96-well plate (Costar no. 3596), differentiated for
3 days with PMA, and treated with 20 mM nigericin. IL-1b cytokine production
was determined using the BD Biosciences Human IL-1b ELISA Set II as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. Data were normalized with 100% as nigericin
treated, and untreated cells as 0%. Data shown are the average and SD of
at least three biological replicates. Statistical significance was determined us-
ing a one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey’s test to compare compound
treated with nigericin only.
Figure 5. Caspase Inhibition by NSAIDs Is COX Independent
(A) HCT116 cells treated with 10 mM staurosporine and 100 mM NSAIDs demonstrate inhibition of caspase-3 catalysis. HCT116 cells do not express COX-2,
indicating that caspase inhibition is not contingent on canonical COX2 pharmacology. Data are representative of the average and SD of three biological repli-
cates. 100% = staurosporine, 0% = z-VAD-FMK. *p % 0.05 compared with 100% control.
(B) Cell death assays in C. elegans embryos treated with fenbufen or indoprofen. L4-stage ced-1(e1735) animals were exposed to 100 mM fenbufen or indoprofen
in 0.5% DMSO on NGM agar plates, and their progenies were analyzed. Embryonic cell corpses were scored at 1.5-, 2-, 2.5-, 3-, and 4-fold stages. The y axis
represents the mean and SD of cell corpses scored (n = 15). The statistical significance was determined using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. *p %

 siRNA Knock Down and Western Blot
HeLa cells were plated at 300,000 cells/well in a 6-well tissue-culture treated
plate (Costar no. 3516) and grown in supplemented DMEM (1% penicillin/
streptomycin, 10% FBS). Wells were transfected using 1.2 mL Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 25 nM of siRNA. COX2 siRNA was
obtained from Dharmacon (ON-TARGETplus Human PTGS2 SMARTpool
5743). Silencer Select CASP3 (no. 4290824) and GAPDH (no. 4390849)
siRNAs were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. For each experiment,
a mock transfection control was performed without siRNA. Cells were main-
tained for 48 hr, then transferred into a 96-well plate at 10,000 cells/well and
grown overnight. The following day, 72 hr post transfection, cells were as-
sayed for caspase-3 activity as described above, or collected for protein
expression analysis by western blot. For western blot, cell pellets were
collected, lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) and assayed for total protein content using the Pierce BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
For caspase-3 and GAPDH detection, 20 mg of total protein was loaded per
lane. Due to the lower expression levels of COX2, 50 mg of total protein
was loaded per lane. COX2 (no. 4842), GAPDH (no. 2118), and caspase-3
(no. 9662) primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technolo-
gies. Peroxidase-conjugated Affinity Pure Goat Anti-rabbit IgG secondary
antibody was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (111-
035-003). Knock down was quantified using Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012;
Schneider et al., 2012). Data shown are the average and SD of at least two
biological replicates. Data were normalized with mock staurosporine treated
as 100%, and 0% as z-VAD-FMK treated.
Tryptophan Fluorescence
Caspase-3 tryptophan fluorescence was detected on a HORIBA Jobin Yvon
Fluorolog using FluorEssence software. Fluorescence of 250 nM caspase-3
was measured with excitation at 295 nm and emission from 300 to 450 nm.
Indoprofen or aspirin was titrated into the sample and the change in fluores-
cence at 342 nm was quantified. Samples were incubated for 5 min after titra-
tion in order to ensure equilibrium. Data were normalized as caspase-3 titrated
with DMSO as 100% and buffer titrated with compound as 0%. This accounts
for quenching by DMSO, and for the intrinsic fluorescence of the NSAID. Data
shown are the average and SD of at least two independent trials.
COX-Independent Apoptosis in C. elegans
The phenotypic analysis in animals was conducted using a C. elegans mutant,
ced-1(e1735), which is defective in the cell corpse clearance process. Fenbu-
fen or indoprofen (100 mL of 100 mM) with 0.5% DMSO were added to the nem-
atode growth medium plates seeded with bacteria (OP-50), and incubated for
3 min at room temperature for absorption. One hundred L4 animals were
placed on the plates and incubated for 1 day at 20�C to allow them to lay em-
bryos. The live embryos were then subjected to cell corpse counting as
described previously (Parrish et al., 2003). Statistical significance was deter-
mined using a one-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey’s test to compare com-
pound treated with the 0.5% DMSO control.
Computational Docking Analysis
Docking of NSAIDs with caspase-3 was performed using SwissDock (Grosdid-
ier et al., 2011a, 2011b). Compounds (indoprofen: ZINC 391; aspirin: ZINC 53;
fenbufen: ZINC 1427) were docked against caspase-3 (PDB: 2DKO) (Ganesan
et al., 2006). Drug structures were obtained from ZINC, provided by the Irwin
and Shoichet Laboratories in the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) (Irwin and Shoichet, 2005;
Irwin et al., 2012; Sterling and Irwin, 2015). Clusters were scored using their
FullFitness, and the top hit was visualized. Molecular graphics and analyses
were performed with the UCSF Chimera package. Chimera is developed by
the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the UCSF
(Pettersen et al., 2004).
Chemical Space Analysis
ChemGPS-NP was used to explore the chemical space of screening hits (Lars-
son et al., 2007). ChemGPS-NP was developed and made available by the
Backlund group at Uppsala University. Using ChemGPS-NP PCA analysis,
compounds were compared based on factors such as size, aromaticity, polar-
ity, and hydrophobicity. Compound size, shape, and polarizability is deter-
mined by molecular weight, number of atoms, and Ghose-Crippen molar
refractivity. Aromaticity and conjugation is based on the number of aromatic
bonds, aromatic carbons, aromatic hydroxyl groups, and the aromatic ratio.
Lipophilicity, polarity, and hydrogen-bond capacity are determined by the
number of hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, the sum of atomic polariz-
abilities, and the Ghose-Crippen ALogP. Flexibility and rigidity are calculated
with the rotatable bond fraction based on the number of bonds, rings, and
rotatable bonds.
