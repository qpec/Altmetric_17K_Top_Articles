 Diagnosis and Management of Diabetes: Synopsis of the 2016
American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes
James J. Chamberlain, MD; Andrew S. Rhinehart, MD; Charles F. Shaefer Jr., MD; and Annie Neuman, PA-C
Description: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) pub-
lished the 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (Stan-
dards) to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and
other interested parties with the components of diabetes care,
general treatment goals, and tools to evaluate the quality of care.
Methods: The ADA Professional Practice Committee performed
a systematic search on MEDLINE to revise or clarify recommen-
dations based on new evidence. The committee assigns the rec-
ommendations a rating of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of
evidence. The E rating for expert opinion is assigned to recom-
mendations based on expert consensus or clinical experience.
The Standards were reviewed and approved by the Executive
Committee of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health
care professionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from
the larger clinical community was incorporated into the 2016
revision.
Recommendations: The synopsis focuses on 8 key areas that
are important to primary care providers. The recommendations
highlight individualized care to manage the disease, prevent or
delay complications, and improve outcomes.

S
ince 1989, the American Diabetes Association
(ADA) Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (Stan-
dards) have provided the framework for evidence-
based recommendations to treat patients with diabe-
tes. This synopsis of the 2016 ADA Standards highlights
8 areas that are important to primary care providers:
diagnosis, glycemic targets, medical management, hy-
poglycemia, cardiovascular risk factor management,
microvascular disease screening and management,
and inpatient diabetes management.
GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT AND EVIDENCE
GRADING
The ADA Professional Practice Committee (PPC),
which comprises physicians, diabetes educators, regis-
tered dietitians, and public health experts, developed
the Standards. All PPC members disclosed potential
conflicts of interest in accordance with the Institute of
Medicine standards. For the 2016 Standards, the PPC
systematically searched from 1 January to 7 December
2015 on MEDLINE to find and grade new evidence. As
a larger body of evidence becomes available, recom-
mendations and their grading levels are updated.
The recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B,
or C, depending on the quality of evidence. The E rat-
ing for expert opinion is a separate category for recom-
mendations in which there is no evidence from clinical
trials, clinical trials may be impractical, or evidence is
conflicting. Recommendations with an A rating are
based on large, well-designed clinical trials or high-
quality meta-analyses. Recommendations with lower
levels of evidence may be equally important but are not
as well-supported.
The PPC receives feedback from the larger clinical
community throughout the year. Public comments are
submitted on the Standards Web site.
The ADA funds development of the Standards out
of its general revenues and does not use industry sup-
port for these purposes. The complete Standards can
be downloaded at professional.diabetes.org/annals.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DIAGNOSIS OF
DIABETES
Table 1 shows diagnostic criteria (1, 2). Classifying
a patient with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM
or T2DM, respectively) is important because medical
management will be affected. Type 1 diabetes mellitus
accounts for approximately 5% of diagnosed diabetes
cases and is defined by the presence of 1 or more au-
toimmune markers.
During pregnancy, women with risk factors should
be tested for undiagnosed T2DM using standard diag-
nostic criteria at the first prenatal visit (B rating). Testing
for gestational diabetes should be done at 24 to 28
weeks of gestation in pregnant women not previously
known to have diabetes by using the “1-step” strategy
with a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test or the “2-step”
approach with a 50-g (nonfasting) screen followed by a
100-g oral glucose tolerance test for those who screen
positive (3, 4) (A rating). Women with gestational dia-
betes should be screened for persistent diabetes at 6
to 12 weeks after delivery by using nonpregnancy di-
agnostic criteria (E rating). Women with a history of
gestational diabetes should be screened for diabetes
or prediabetes at least every 3 years (B rating).
Maturity-onset diabetes of the young, which is
caused by a defect in insulin secretion inherited in an
autosomal dominant pattern, should be considered in
patients with mild stable fasting hyperglycemia and

 multiple family members with diabetes that is not typi-
cal of T1DM or T2DM (E rating). All children diagnosed
with diabetes in the first 6 months of life should have
genetic testing (B rating). Clinicians should consider re-
ferring these patients to a specialist.
Certain medications, such as glucocorticoids, thia-
zide diuretics, and atypical antipsychotics, may increase
the risk for diabetes (5).
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR GLYCEMIC TARGETS
Assessment of Glycemic Control
Glycemic
control
is
assessed
by
patient
self-
monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) levels. Continuous monitoring of interstitial
glucose may be a useful adjunct to SMBG in selected
patients on intensive insulin regimens.
Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose
Self-monitoring of blood glucose is integral to ef-
fective therapy (6), allowing patients to evaluate their
individual response and assess whether glycemic tar-
gets are being achieved. Specific treatments, needs,
and goals should dictate SMBG frequency and timing.
Most patients receiving intensive insulin regimens,
either multiple-dose insulin injections (3 to 4 injections
of basal and prandial insulin per day) or continuous
subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump therapy),
should consider SMBG before meals and snacks; post-
prandially (occasionally); at bedtime; before exercise;
when they suspect low blood glucose levels; and be-
fore critical tasks, such as driving.
Evidence is insufficient to determine when to pre-
scribe SMBG and the frequency of SMBG for patients
not receiving an intensive insulin regimen. Performing
SMBG alone does not decrease blood glucose levels.
To be useful, the information must be integrated into
clinical and self-management plans.
Hemoglobin A1c Testing
Hemoglobin A1c level reflects average glycemia
over several months and has strong predictive value for
diabetes complications (7, 8). The frequency of HbA1c
testing should depend on the clinical situation, the
treatment regimen, and the clinician's judgment. The
HbA1c test should be performed at least twice a year in
patients who meet treatment goals and who have sta-
ble glycemic control (E rating). The HbA1c test should
be done quarterly in patients whose therapy has
changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals (E rat-
ing). Table 2 shows the correlation between HbA1c lev-
els and mean glucose levels (9, 10).
Hemoglobin A1c Limitations
Hemoglobin A1c testing has limitations. Conditions
that affect erythrocyte turnover (hemolysis or blood
loss) and hemoglobin variants must be considered
(sickle cell anemia), particularly when the HbA1c result
does not correlate with the patient's blood glucose
levels.
Hemoglobin A1c testing alone does not provide a
measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. Gly-
cemic control is best evaluated by the combination of
results from SMBG and HbA1c testing.

 Hemoglobin A1c Goals in Nonpregnant Adults
The HbA1c goal for most nonpregnant adults is less
than 7% (Appendix Table, available at www.annals
.org). Glycemic control has been shown to reduce mi-
crovascular complications of diabetes in persons with
T1DM and T2DM and mortality in those with T1DM (11,
12). If implemented soon after the diagnosis of diabe-
tes, this target is associated with long-term reduction in
macrovascular disease (A rating). Providers might sug-
gest more stringent HbA1c goals (such as <6.5%) for
selected patients (such as those with short duration of
diabetes, T2DM treated with lifestyle or metformin,
long life expectancy, or no cardiovascular disease) (C
rating). More stringent goals are associated with in-
creased hypoglycemia, and studies have shown no fur-
ther improvement in cardiovascular disease or mortal-
ity (13–15). Less stringent HbA1c goals (such as <8%)
may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe
hypoglycemia (plasma glucose level <2.22 mmol/L
[<40 mg/dL]), limited life expectancy, advanced micro-
vascular or macrovascular complications, extensive co-
morbid conditions, or long-standing diabetes. The gen-
eral goal is difficult to attain in such patients despite
diabetes self-management education; appropriate glu-
cose monitoring; and effective doses of multiple
glucose-lowering agents, including insulin (16, 17)
(B rating).
When individualizing a patient's goals, many fac-
tors, including patient preferences and disease factors,
should be considered (Appendix Figure, available at
www.annals.org) (18).
HYPOGLYCEMIA
Hypoglycemia (plasma glucose level <3.9 mmol/L
[<70 mg/dL]) is the major limiting factor in the glycemic
management of T1DM and insulin-treated T2DM. Se-
vere hypoglycemia, characterized by cognitive impair-
ment, is defined as that in which the patient requires
assistance from another person. Patients at risk for se-
vere hypoglycemia should be prescribed glucagon,
and their close contacts should be instructed on how to
administer it (E rating). Hypoglycemia may be reversed
with administration of rapid-acting glucose (15 to 20 g).
Pure glucose is the preferred treatment; however, any
form of carbohydrate that contains glucose will in-
crease blood glucose level. Added fat and protein may
delay the acute glycemic response. Blood glucose re-
versal should be confirmed with SMBG after 15 min-
utes; if hypoglycemia persists, the process should be
repeated. Patients should be educated on situations
that increase their risk for hypoglycemia, such as fasting
for tests or procedures, during or after exercise, and
during sleep.
Hypoglycemia unawareness is characterized by de-
ficient counterregulatory hormone release and a dimin-
ished autonomic response, both of which are risk fac-
tors for and caused by hypoglycemia. Patients with
hypoglycemia unawareness should be advised to in-
crease their glycemic targets for at least several weeks
to partially reverse hypoglycemia unawareness and re-
duce the risk for future episodes.
Providers should be vigilant in preventing hypogly-
cemia in patients with advanced disease and should
not aggressively attempt to achieve near-normal HbA1c
levels in patients in whom such targets cannot be safely
and reasonably reached. Severe or frequent hypogly-
cemia is an absolute indication for the modification of
treatment regimens.
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES
Foundations of Care
Optimal diabetes care addresses behavioral, di-
etary, lifestyle, and pharmaceutical interventions. All
patients should participate in diabetes self-management
education and support (B rating). An individualized
medical nutrition therapy program, preferably pro-
vided by a registered dietitian, is recommended for all
persons with diabetes (A rating). A physical activity plan
should include at least 150 minutes of moderate-
intensity aerobic activity per week, reduced sedentary
time, and resistance training at least twice per week for
most adults with diabetes.
Type 1 Diabetes
Most patients with T1DM should be treated with
multiple-dose insulin injections or continuous subcuta-
neous insulin injection (19) (A rating). Studies have
shown clear improvements in the risk for or progres-
sion of microvascular complications and cardiovascular
disease with intensive insulin therapy (≥3 injections of
insulin per day) or continuous subcutaneous insulin in-
fusion compared with 1 or 2 injections per day (6, 20).
Patients should be offered education on matching
prandial insulin doses to carbohydrate intake, prepran-
dial blood glucose levels, and anticipated activity level
(E rating). Patients with T1DM should use insulin ana-
logues
to
reduce
hypoglycemia
risk
(21,
22)
(A rating).
Continuous glucose monitoring systems have re-
cently been shown to significantly reduce severe hypo-
glycemia risk in patients with T1DM (23). Insulin pump
therapy with a low blood glucose level “suspend” fea-
ture, augmented by continuous glucose monitoring, re-
duced
nocturnal
hypoglycemia
without
increasing
HbA1c levels (24).
Type 2 Diabetes
A patient-centered approach should guide the
choice of pharmacologic agents (18). Providers should
include efficacy; cost; potential side effects, including
effects on weight, comorbidities, and risk for hypogly-
cemia; and patient preferences when considering dif-
ferent agents (E rating).
Initial Therapy
Newly diagnosed patients who are overweight or
obese should begin lifestyle modifications, including
physical activity, and be counseled to lose at least 5%
of their body weight.

 If lifestyle efforts are not sufficient to maintain or
achieve glycemic goals, metformin therapy (if tolerated
or not contraindicated) should be added at or soon
after diagnosis. Metformin is the preferred initial phar-
macologic agent (A rating). It is inexpensive, has a long-
established evidence base for efficacy and safety, and
may reduce risk for cardiovascular events and death
(25, 26). Accumulating data suggest that metformin
therapy can be continued in patients with declining re-
nal function down to a glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
of 30 to 45 mL/min, although the dose should be
reduced (27).
Combination Therapy
When monotherapy with a noninsulin agent at the
maximum tolerated dose does not achieve or maintain
the HbA1c target over 3 months, a second agent should
be added (A rating). Providers should consider a com-
bination of metformin and 1 of these 6 treatment op-
tions:
sulfonylureas,
thiazolidinediones,
dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 inhibitors (28), sodium–glucose cotrans-
porter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) agonists, or basal insulin (Figure). The drug
should be based on the patient, disease, drug charac-
teristics, and patient preferences (17). Rapid-acting
secretagogues (meglitinides) can be used in place of
sulfonylureas in patients with erratic meal schedules or
those who have late postprandial hypoglycemia while
receiving sulfonylurea therapy. Other drugs, such as
�-glucosidase inhibitors, bromocriptine, colesevelam,
and pramlintide, can be used in specific situations. Ini-
tial dual-regimen combination therapy should be used
when the HbA1c level is 9% or greater to more quickly
achieve glycemic control.
Insulin Therapy
Insulin should be used with any combination regi-
men in newly diagnosed patients when severe hyper-
glycemia causes ketosis or unintentional weight loss (E
rating). Insulin therapy should not be delayed in pa-
tients not achieving glycemic goals (B rating). Once in-
sulin therapy is initiated, timely dose titration is impor-
tant. Adjustment of both basal and prandial insulins
should be based on SMBG levels.
Basal Insulin
Basal insulin may be initiated at 10 units or 0.1 to
0.2 units/kg of body weight. Basal insulin is typically
used with metformin and perhaps 1 additional nonin-
sulin agent.
When basal insulin has been titrated to appropriate
fasting blood glucose levels but the HbA1c level re-
mains above target, combination injectable therapy
should be considered to reduce postprandial glucose
excursions. A GLP-1 receptor agonist (29) or prandial
insulin, such as 1 to 3 injections of a rapid-acting insulin
(lispro, aspart, or glulisine) administered immediately
before meals, may be used. Twice-daily premixed insu-
lin analogues (70/30 aspart mix or 75/25 or 50/50 lis-
pro mix) may also be considered; their pharmacody-
namic profiles make them suboptimal for covering
postprandial glucose excursions.
Bolus Insulin
When bolus insulin is needed, insulin analogues
are preferred because they are faster-acting. Inhaled
insulin is available for prandial use but has a limited
dosing range. It is contraindicated in patients with
chronic lung disease. Lung function testing before and
after initiation of therapy is required (30).
A common conundrum for providers is whether to
continue oral and injectable agents when insulin ther-
apy is initiated. Sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4
inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists are usually
withdrawn when more complicated insulin regimens
(beyond basal insulin) are used. Thiazolidinediones
(usually pioglitazone) or SGLT2 inhibitors may be used
to improve glucose control and reduce total daily insu-
lin dose. Thiazolidinediones should be used with cau-
tion in patients with or at risk for congestive heart fail-
ure and have been associated with fractures and
weight gain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
recently issued a warning about the risk for ketoacido-
sis with SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients should stop taking
their SGLT2 inhibitor and seek medical attention imme-
diately if they have symptoms of ketoacidosis (31).
CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)—
defined as an acute coronary syndrome, a history of
myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coro-
nary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient
ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease (PAD)—is
the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for per-
sons with diabetes. In all patients with diabetes,
cardiovascular risk factors should be systematically as-
sessed at least annually. These risk factors include dys-
lipidemia, hypertension, smoking, a family history of
premature coronary disease, and the presence of
albuminuria.
Controlling individual cardiovascular risk factors
can prevent or slow ASCVD in persons with diabetes.
Large benefits are seen when multiple risk factors are
addressed simultaneously. Measures of 10-year coro-
nary heart disease risk among U.S. adults with diabetes
have improved significantly over the past decade,
and ASCVD morbidity and mortality have decreased
(32–34).
Hypertension
Blood pressure should be measured at every rou-
tine visit. An elevated blood pressure should be
confirmed on a separate day (B rating). Persons with
diabetes and hypertension should have a blood pres-
sure treatment goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg (35) (A
rating). In older adults, pharmacologic therapy to a
treatment goal of less than 130/70 mm Hg is not rec-
ommended; treatment to a systolic blood pressure
goal of less than 130 mm Hg has not been shown to

has been associated with higher mortality (36) (C rat-

Lifestyle therapy for patients with diabetes and hy-
pertension should consist of weight loss, a reduced-
sodium diet, moderate alcohol intake, and increased
physical activity. Pharmacologic therapy should com-

 prise a regimen that includes either an angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin-
receptor blocker (ARB) but not both (37–39) (B rating).
If one class is not tolerated, the other should be substi-
tuted (40) (C rating). Multidrug therapy is generally re-
quired to achieve blood pressure targets. During preg-
nancy, treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs is
contraindicated because they may cause fetal damage.
If ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or diuretics are used, serum
creatinine levels or estimated GFR (eGFR) and serum
potassium levels should be monitored (E rating).
Lipid Management
In adults not receiving statins, it is reasonable to
obtain a lipid profile at the time of diabetes diagnosis,
at an initial medical evaluation, and every 5 years there-
after (or more frequently if indicated) (E rating). A lipid
profile should be obtained at initiation of statin therapy
and periodically thereafter because it may help to mon-
itor the response to therapy and inform adherence (E
rating). Lifestyle modification should be recommended
to improve the lipid profile. This includes focusing on
weight loss (if indicated); reducing intake of saturated
fat, trans fat, and cholesterol; increasing intake of �-3
fatty acids, viscous fiber, and plant stanols or sterols;
and increasing physical activity (A rating).
Lifestyle therapy should be intensified and glyce-
mic control optimized for patients with elevated triglyc-
eride levels (≥1.7 mmol/L [≥150 mg/dL]) and/or low
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels
(<1.0
mmol/L [<40 mg/dL] for men and <1.3 mmol/L [<50
mg/dL] for women) (C rating). For patients with fasting
triglyceride levels of 5.7 mmol/L (500 mg/dL) or
greater, evaluation for secondary causes of hypertri-
glyceridemia should be done and medical therapy
should be considered to reduce the risk for pancreatitis
(C rating).
In addition to intensive lifestyle therapy, statin use
is recommended for most persons with diabetes aged
40 years or older (Table 3). Table 4 provides guidance
on statin use and intensity. The addition of ezetimibe to
moderate-intensity statin therapy has been shown to
provide additional cardiovascular benefit compared
with moderate-intensity statin therapy alone, and it may
be considered for patients with a recent acute coronary
syndrome and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
level of 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) or greater or for those
who cannot tolerate high-intensity statin therapy (41) (A
rating).
Combination therapy with a statin and a fibrate has
not been shown to improve ASCVD outcomes and is
generally not recommended (A rating). However, ther-
apy with a statin and fenofibrate may be considered for
men with a triglyceride level of 2.3 mmol/L (204 mg/dL)
or greater and a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
level of 0.9 mmol/L (34 mg/dL) or lower (B rating).
Combination therapy with a statin and niacin has not
been shown to increase cardiovascular benefit more
than statin therapy alone. This therapy may increase the
risk for stroke and is generally not recommended
(A rating).
Antiplatelet Agents
Aspirin therapy (75 to 162 mg/d) is recommended
as a primary prevention strategy in patients with T1DM
and T2DM who are at increased cardiovascular risk (10-
year risk >10%) (C rating). Aspirin should not be recom-
mended for ASCVD prevention in adults with diabetes
who are at low ASCVD risk (10-year risk <5%) (C rating).
Clinical judgment is necessary for patients with diabe-
tes who are younger than 50 years and have several
other risk factors (for example, 10-year ASCVD risk of
5% to 10%). Aspirin therapy is well-established as a sec-
ondary prevention strategy in patients with diabetes
and a history of ASCVD. In patients with ASCVD and a
documented aspirin allergy, clopidogrel (75 mg/d)
should be used. Dual-antiplatelet therapy is reasonable
for up to a year after an acute coronary syndrome.
MICROVASCULAR DISEASE SCREENING AND
MANAGEMENT
Diabetic Kidney Disease
Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of
end-stage renal disease (42). Intensive diabetes man-
agement, with the goal of achieving near-normo-
glycemia, may delay the onset and progression of albu-
minuria and reduced eGFR (43, 44). Annual diabetic
kidney disease screening should be performed via
urine albumin–creatinine ratio on a spot urine sample
and eGFR in patients who have had T1DM for at least 5
years, in all patients with T2DM, and in all patients with
comorbid hypertension (B rating). Two of three urine
albumin–creatinine ratio specimens collected over 3 to
6 months should be abnormal (>30 mg/g) before a pa-

 tient can be considered to have albuminuria. Patients
with persistent and severely increased levels of albu-
minuria (≥300 mg/g) are more likely to develop end-
stage renal disease (45, 46). Referral to a nephrologist
should be considered when there is uncertainty about
the cause of kidney disease or advanced kidney dis-
ease (B rating).
Use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs helps to slow the
progression of kidney disease in hypertensive patients
with diabetes with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73
m2 and a urine albumin–creatinine ratio greater than
300 mg/g (47, 48).
Retinopathy
Optimizing glycemic control (A rating), blood pres-
sure, and serum lipid control (A rating) is key to reduc-
ing the risk for and slowing the progression of diabetic
retinopathy. Annual comprehensive eye examination
by an ophthalmologist or optometrist should begin for
patients who have had T1DM for more than 5 years and
for those with T2DM at diagnosis (49) (B rating). Retinal
photographs are not a substitute for a comprehensive
eye examination.
Neuropathy
Achieving glycemic control can effectively prevent
or delay diabetic peripheral neuropathy (A rating) and
cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in T1DM (50, 51)
and may slow their progression in T2DM (52) (B rating),
but it does not reverse neuronal loss. Manifestations of
diabetic autonomic neuropathy include hypoglycemia
unawareness, gastroparesis, constipation, diarrhea, fe-
cal
incontinence,
erectile
dysfunction,
neurogenic
bladder, and sudomotor dysfunction. Cardiovascular
autonomic neuropathy is associated with mortality in-
dependent of other cardiovascular risk factors (13, 53).
Manifestations include resting tachycardia and ortho-
static hypotension.
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can be severe and
can affect quality of life (54). Symptoms may include
dysesthesias and numbness. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has approved pregabalin, duloxetine,
and tapentadol for treatment of diabetic peripheral
neuropathy. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, ven-
lafaxine, carbamazepine, topical capsaicin, and trama-
dol may be considered as additional treatment options.
Foot Care
All patients who have had T1DM for more than 5
years and all patients with T2DM should have a foot
examination annually using 10-g monofilament testing
plus pinprick sensation, vibration perception, or ankle
reflexes (55) (B rating). At least 2 normal test results rule
out loss of protective sensation. In addition, foot exam-
inations should include inspection of skin integrity,
identification of bony deformities, and assessment of
pedal pulses.
Patients with a history of foot ulceration or amputa-
tion, foot deformities, peripheral neuropathy, PAD,
poor glycemic control, visual impairment, and cigarette
smoking are considered to be at high risk (56). High-
risk patients should be educated on proper foot care
and the importance of daily foot monitoring. Patients
with advanced foot disease may require custom-fitted
shoes. Diabetic foot wounds without evidence of soft
tissue or bone infection do not require antibiotic ther-
apy. Foot ulcers and wounds may require care from a
multidisciplinary team (57) (B rating).
Screening for PAD should include a history of clau-
dication and assessment of pedal pulses. Ankle–bra-
chial index testing should be considered in patients
aged 50 years or older and in those younger than 50
years with PAD risk factors (including smoking, hyper-
tension, and dyslipidemia) or a diabetes duration
greater than 10 years (58).
DIABETES CARE IN THE HOSPITAL
Inpatient hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are as-
sociated with adverse outcomes, including death (59,
60). Therefore, hospital glucose goals include prevent-
ing hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, promoting the
shortest safe hospital stay, and providing an effective
transition out of the hospital that prevents complica-
tions and readmission.
Glycemic Targets in Hospitalized Patients
Inpatient glucose targets of 7.8 to 10 mmol/L (140
to 180 mg/dL) are recommended for most noncritical
(C rating) and critically ill (A rating) patients (60). How-
ever, glucose targets of 6.1 to 7.8 mmol/L (110 to 140
mg/dL) may be appropriate for some patients (C rat-
ing), such as cardiac surgery patients (61, 62) and those
with acute ischemic cardiac (63) or neurologic events, if
the targets can be achieved without significant hypo-
glycemia. Conversely, higher glucose ranges may be
acceptable in certain populations, such as terminally ill
patients.
Antihyperglycemic Agents in Hospitalized
Patients
In the critical care setting, continuous intravenous
insulin infusion is the best method for achieving glyce-
mic targets. Intravenous insulin infusions should be ad-
ministered on the basis of validated written or comput-
erized protocols that allow for predefined adjustments
in the infusion rate, accounting for glycemic fluctua-
tions and insulin dose (60, 64) (E rating).

 Insulin is the preferred therapy for persistent hyper-
glycemia (plasma blood glucose level >10 mmol/L
[>180 mg/dL]). Outside critical care units, scheduled
subcutaneous insulin injections should align with meals
and bedtime or should be administered every 4 to 6
hours if no meals are consumed or continuous enteral
or parenteral therapy is used (60). An insulin regimen
with basal, nutritional, and correction components
(basal–bolus) is the preferred treatment for patients
with good nutritional intake (65) (A rating). In such in-
stances, point-of-care glucose testing should be per-
formed immediately before meals. Consistent carbohy-
drate meal plans are preferred because they facilitate
matching the prandial insulin dose to the amount of
carbohydrate consumed (66). A basal-plus-correction
insulin regimen is the preferred treatment for patients
with poor oral intake or those who are receiving noth-
ing by mouth (64) (A rating). The sole use of sliding-
scale insulin in the inpatient hospital setting is strongly
discouraged (60, 67) (A rating).
When intravenous insulin therapy is discontinued, a
transition protocol to a subcutaneous insulin regimen is
associated with lower morbidity and costs of care (68).
Subcutaneous insulin should be given 1 to 2 hours be-
fore intravenous insulin therapy is discontinued. Con-
verting to basal insulin at 60% to 80% of the daily infu-
sion dose has been shown to be effective (60, 68, 69).
Hypoglycemia in the Hospital
Hospital-related hypoglycemia is associated with
higher mortality. Iatrogenic hypoglycemia triggers in-
clude sudden reduction of corticosteroid dose; altered
ability of the patient to report symptoms; reduced oral
intake; emesis; new nothing-by-mouth status; inappro-
priate timing of short-acting insulin in relation to meals;
reduced infusion rate of intravenous dextrose; and un-
expected interruption of oral, enteral, or parenteral
feedings. A standardized hospital-wide and nurse-
initiated hypoglycemia treatment protocol should be in
place to immediately address hypoglycemia (60).
Transition From the Acute Care Setting
A structured discharge plan should be tailored to
the individual patient (B rating), which may reduce
length of hospital stay and readmission rates and in-
crease patient satisfaction (70). To help guide treat-
ment decisions at the time of transition, admission or-
ders should include an HbA1c level if none is available
within the prior 3 months (60). Discharge planning
should begin at admission and should be updated as
patient needs change. An outpatient follow-up visit
within 1 month of discharge is advised.

tions for Nonpregnant Adults With Diabetes
Variable
Value*
Hemoglobin A1c level
<7.0%
Preprandial capillary plasma glucose
level
4.4–7.2 mmol/L (80–130 mg/dL)
Peak postprandial capillary plasma
glucose level†
<10.0 mmol/L (<180 mg/dL)
* More or less stringent glycemic goals may be appropriate for indi-
vidual patients. Goals should be individualized on the basis of dura-
tion of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known car-
diovascular
disease
or
advanced
microvascular
complications,
hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient considerations.
† Postprandial glucose level may be targeted if hemoglobin A1c goals
are not met but preprandial glucose goals are. Postprandial glucose
measurements should be made 1–2 h after the beginning of the meal
(generally peak levels in patients with diabetes).

Depicted are patient and disease factors used to determine optimal HbA1c targets. Characteristics and predicaments toward the left justify more
stringent efforts to lower HbA1c level, and those toward the right suggest less stringent efforts. Adapted with permission from Inzucchi and
colleagues (18) and the American Diabetes Association. HbA1c = hemoglobin A1c.
