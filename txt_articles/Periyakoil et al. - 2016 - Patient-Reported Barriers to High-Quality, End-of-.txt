Abstract
Objective: The study objective was to empirically identify barriers reported by multiethnic patients and families
in receiving high-quality end-of-life care (EOLC).
Methods: This cross-sectional, mixed-methods study in Burmese, English, Hindi, Mandarin, Tagalog, Spanish,
and Vietnamese was held in multiethnic community centers in five California cities. Data were collected in
2013–2014. A snowball sampling technique was used to accrue 387 participants—261 women, 126 men, 133
Caucasian, 204 Asian Americans, 44 African Americans, and 6 Hispanic Americans. Measured were multi-
ethnic patient-reported barriers to high-quality EOLC. A development cohort (72 participants) of responses was
analyzed qualitatively using grounded theory to identify the six key barriers to high-quality EOLC. A new
validation cohort (315 participants) of responses was transcribed, translated, and back-translated for verifica-
tion. The codes were validated by analyses of responses from 50 randomly drawn subjects from the validation
cohort. All the 315 validation cohort transcripts were coded for presence or absence of the six barriers.
Results: In the validation cohort, 60.6% reported barriers to receiving high-quality EOLC for persons in their
culture/ethnicity. Primary patient-reported barriers were (1) finance/health insurance barriers, (2) doctor be-
haviors, (3) communication chasm between doctors and patients, (4) family beliefs/behaviors, (5) health system
barriers, and (6) cultural/religious barriers. Age (v2 = 9.15, DF = 1, p = 0.003); gender (v2 = 6.605, DF = 1,
p = 0.01); and marital status (v2 = 16.11 DF = 3, p = 0.001) were associated with reporting barriers; and women
<80 years were most likely to report barriers to receiving high-quality EOLC. Individual responses of reported
barriers were analyzed and only the participant’s level of education (Friedman statistic = 2.16, DF = 10, p = 0.02)
significantly influenced choices.
Conclusion: Multiethnic patients report that high-quality EOLC is important to them; but unfortunately, a
majority state that they have encountered barriers to receiving such care. Efforts must be made to rapidly
improve access to culturally competent EOLC for diverse populations.
Introduction
T
oo large a gulf exists1–3 between the health care
Americans want at life’s end and what actually occurs. A
vast majority of patients1,4 say that they wish to avoid inef-
fective, high-intensity care and prefer to die gently and nat-
urally, but their wishes are often overridden. National data4–6
show that the end-of-life care (EOLC) patients receive de-
pends not on their wishes or their advance directives (ADs),
but rather on local health care system variables like institu-
tional capacity and individual doctors’ practice style. Thus a
big percentage of the 2.6 million Americans who die every
year7 spend the last phase of their lives beset with repeated
hospitalizations, subjected to ineffective and burdensome
high-intensity treatments at great human cost. The cost to the
nation is not trivial either. U.S. health care spending, which is
already extremely high, is projected to escalate further.8
Better outcomes are not associated with higher costs.1,2 Ju-
dicious curbing of costs in the end-of-life (EOL) arena, by
avoiding ineffective treatments that patients and families do
not want, will allow1 for redirecting of resources toward vital
services like caregiver support and other basic care needs
specifically tailored to increase quality of care for all seri-
ously ill persons.
Health disparities persist well into EOL9–13 with seriously
ill ethnic minority patients being disproportionately affected
by poor-quality care. The United States is poised to become a
minority majority nation in 2044.14 Thus the need to ensure
culturally competent, high-quality EOLC for diverse Amer-
icans is not only a national priority but also perhaps the

 largest public health crisis looming over our nation. This
multilingual, mixed-methods study15 was conducted to de-
termine if multiethnic patients and families valued high-
quality EOLC and if they had encountered barriers to such
care for persons within their racial/ethnic community.
Methods
Study sample
Multiethnic people from five cities (Fremont, Palo Alto,
San Francisco, San Jose, and Walnut Creek) in California
participated in a cross-sectional survey; data were collected
from calendar years 2013–2014 and analyzed in 2014–2015.
Participants were recruited from community-based centers
using a snowball sampling technique.
Data collection
The questionnaire was administered once. No personal
health identifiers were collected in an effort to promote par-
ticipant confidentiality and honest responses without con-
cerns about individual scrutiny. In order to ensure ease of
participation for patients with Limited English Proficiency
(LEP), the study was conducted both in English and their
primary language. Medical interpreters were available to help
LEP patients. Stanford University’s institutional review
board approval was obtained to conduct the study and ana-
lyze the data presented in this paper. These are the open-
ended triggers used in data collection:
� Is receiving high-quality EOLC important to you?
� Please list the top three barriers (if any) you and people
from your culture, race, and ethnicity face/have faced
in receiving high-quality health care at the EOL?
Study phase 1
The objectives of this development phase were (1) to en-
sure the relevance of the research question to patients and
families and (2) to identify common barriers (if any) patients
identify in having effective EOL conversations with their
doctor with the purpose of code development by qualitative
analyses. A sample (n = 72 persons) of community dwelling
persons (23 men and 49 women, 16 Caucasian, 6 Hispanic, 6
African Americans, and 44 Asian Americans) was recruited
and served as the development cohort. All participants in the
development cohort felt that receiving high-quality health
care at the EOL was an important priority for them. Of the
development cohort, 27.8% (n = 20) denied having any bar-
riers and 72.2% (n = 52) reported encountering barriers to
receiving high-quality health care at the EOL.
The open-ended responses by the 52 participants of the
development cohort who reported barriers to receiving high-
quality EOLC were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using
Microsoft Access and NVivo 7 (QSR International Pty Ltd.,
Melbourne Australia). Grounded theory techniques16–17 of
intense open and axial coding were used to identify key
barriers reported. First, using an open-coding approach, one
of the authors (VSP) and a trained research assistant inde-
pendently coded the transcripts of the development cohort.
During open coding, recurrent barriers were identified and
characterized. During axial coding, the barrier categories
were further defined and the relationships between them were
characterized. Next, the coders compared their assignment of
codes, and a third investigator (HCK) mediated any dis-
crepancies between codes assigned until agreement was
reached. Efforts to maintain the validity of the qualitative
data included the following: to evaluate inter-coder reliabil-
ity, the exact assignment of codes was assessed for 100% of
the development cohort transcripts; agreement was found to
be greater than 90%,18–19 which was comparable with pre-
vious work. After 30 transcripts had been coded, no new
codes emerged from the next five transcripts (data saturation
had been reached). To confirm data saturation, the remaining
22 transcripts in the development cohort were coded, with no
new code labels emerging. At the end of this process, six
primary patient-reported barriers to high-quality EOLC were
identified. The development cohort was discarded and not
used in phase 2 of the study.
Study phase 2: Study sample and data collection
The validation cohort consisted of 315 multiethnic partic-
ipants 50 years and older (see Table 1 for demographics). The
trigger questions (see above) were administered to partici-
pants in English or in their preferred language. The questions
were translated and back-translated to ensure accuracy by
medical interpreters into Spanish and several Asian languages
(Burmese, Hindi, Mandarin, Tagalog, and Vietnamese).
Trained interpreters were available on site at the community
centers to assist participants with Limited English Proficiency
(LEP) who needed any help with survey completion. Parti-
cipants had an option to respond to the survey questions either
in their native language or in English. Participant responses in
various languages were translated and verified by profes-
sional medical interpreters and transcribed. Demographic

 data (age, gender, ethnicity, level of education, and marital
status) were collected, but personal identifiers were not
collected in an effort to promote participant confidentiality
and honest responses without concerns about individual
scrutiny. There was no repeated contact of participants.
Code validation
Of the 315 transcripts from the validation cohort, 50 were
drawn randomly and coded independently by the coders
(VSP and project RA) for the presence or absence of each of
the six primary barriers identified by the development cohort,
as well as for any new codes. The two coders then met and
compared codes for each transcript and determined that no
new recurrent codes emerged and that the six primary barriers
identified earlier were sufficient to appropriately code the
entire validation dataset.
Qualitative coding of the validation
cohort (n = 315 subjects)
Next, the validation dataset responses were coded inde-
pendently by the two coders qualitatively for the presence or
absence of the six primary barriers identified by multiethnic
patients in conducting effective EOLC with their doctor
identified by earlier qualitative analyses using grounded
theory methods. The two coders coded the validation cohort
responses independently. All discrepancies in codes were
reviewed by both coders with one of the authors (HCK) and
debated until consensus was reached (Table 2).
Quantitative analyses of validation
cohort responses
The primary six barriers to high-quality EOLC, as identi-
fied by each participant, were rank-ordered according to the
response (with tie ranks, particularly for those barriers not
mentioned). The data were imported into statistical software
SAS (SAS version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) for
quantitative analyses. A variant of the Friedman test25 was
used to compare subgroups (age, gender, ethnicity, education
level, and marital status) and determine if any of the six
primary barriers was ranked consistently higher or lower.
Results
Group differences between patients who reported
barriers to high-quality EOLC and those who did
not report barriers
All participants in the validation cohort affirmed the im-
portance of receiving high-quality EOLC. Of the 315 subjects
in the validation cohort, 124 (39.4%) did not report any
barriers and 191 (60.6%) identified barriers to receiving high-
quality EOLC for persons in their culture/ethnicity. There
were significant differences between the two groups in
terms of age (Mann Whitney Wilcoxon v2 = 9.15, DF = 1, and

marital status (v2 = 16.11, DF= 3, and p = 0.001). A receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to
further understand the group differences (if any) that might
identify patients who are more likely to report barriers to re-
ceiving high-quality EOLC. The ROC found an age and gender
interaction with 74.7% of women <80 years of age being most
likely to report barriers to receiving high-quality EOLC for
persons within their culture/ethnicity/race compared to 48.5%
of men <80 years and 42.2% of persons ‡80 years.
Next, individual responses for the 191 patients who reported
barriers to receiving high-quality EOLC for persons in their
culture/ethnicity were analyzed. Only the participant’s level of
education (Friedman statistic = 2.16, DF= 10, p = 0.02) had a
significant influence on how the participants rated the barriers
to effective EOL conversations with their doctor (Fig. 1). The
group with no formal education was statistically significantly
different ( p = 0.01) from the group with elementary or high
school education. Patients with no formal education found
financial/insurance issues to be most challenging followed by
the communication chasm between doctors and patients. Pa-
tients with any other level of education (elementary, high
school, or more) identified doctor behaviors to be their biggest
barrier to receiving high-quality EOLC for persons in their
culture/ethnicity followed by communication chasm between
doctors and patients. There were no significant differences in
how patients ranked the magnitude of the barriers based on
gender, age, ethnicity, or marital status.
Discussion
All study participants endorsed the importance of receiv-
ing high-quality EOLC for persons in their culture/ethnicity/
race and a majority (60.6%) reported struggles in doing so.
Women from all ethnic groups who were between the ages of
50 and 79 years reported the most struggles in receiving high-
quality EOLC. It is likely that women in this age group are
most likely experienced in caregiving20 for the seriously ill in
their family circle and thus may be more sensitized to the
struggles and barriers in accessing high-quality EOLC.
FIG. 1.
This graphic shows how patients and families of various education levels rate the relative importance of the six
primary barriers to receiving high-quality EOLC. The solid line represents persons with no formal education. The dotted
line represents persons with elementary or high school education. The dashed line indicates persons with college/ graduate/
professional education. Primary barriers in rank order of importance with mean rank and SD are barrier 1 (B1): finance/
health insurance barriers (mean rank 2.93, SD 1.62); barrier 2 (B2): doctor-related barriers (mean rank 3.46, SD 1.48); barrier 3
(B3): communication chasm between doctors and patients (mean rank 3.46, SD 1.45); barrier 4 (B4) (mean rank 3.58, SD
1.33): family barriers; barrier 5 (B5): health system barriers (mean rank 3.58, SD 1.33); and barrier 6 (B6): cultural barriers
(mean rank 3.96, SD 1.16). Patients with no formal education found financial/insurance issues to be most challenging followed
by the communication chasm between doctors and patients and health system issues. Patients with any other level of education
(elementary, high school, or more) identified doctor behaviors to be their biggest barrier to receiving high-quality EOLC for
persons in their culture/ethnicity followed by communication chasm between doctors and patients and health system issues.

 Six primary, multiethnic patient-reported barriers
to receiving high-quality EOLC
Barrier1:Finance/healthinsurancebarriers.
Multiethnic
patients identified lack of finances and insurance to be the
biggest barrier to accessing high-quality EOLC for persons in
their culture/ethnicity. In 2012, an estimated 84 million
Americans did not have insurance for the full year or were
underinsured and unprotected from high out-of-pocket
costs.21 Forty-three percent of Americans reported cost-
related problems getting needed health care. Lack of basic
health access continues to plague the poorest22 in the nation
and exacerbates the health disparities triggered by the social
determinants of health.
Under the current U.S. health system, patients (and fami-
lies) are liable for the costs of care in part or in full even if the
care was ineffective and irrespective of whether they were
informed and consenting recipients of such care. Seriously ill
patients, who access emergent care at safety net hospitals, are
less likely to have access to primary care,23 less likely to
complete advance care planning, and more likely24 to be
subjected to ineffective and burdensome treatments. They
may be forced to bear the cost of this care either in part or in
full, further depleting their meager resources.
A large national study25 identified medical debts to be the
largest cause of personal bankruptcies. Having health insur-
ance is only partially protective against medical bankrupt-
cies, as most medical debtors were educated homeowners in
the workforce and 75% had health insurance. While the Af-
fordable Care Act (ACA) 26 is trying to promote uniform
access to health care, it has also proposed to reduce funding to
safety net hospitals where the poorest in the nation get their
care. Health care needs to be reformed to ensure that diverse
Americans receive high-quality EOLC irrespective of their
socioeconomic status.
Barrier 2: Doctor behaviors.
Our study participants felt
that the doctors were just too busy to initiate EOL conver-
sations, reluctant to listen to their concerns and questions
about EOL decision making, and often gave vague responses,
making it difficult for the patient to comprehend their choices
and make informed decisions. EOL decisions are intensely
personal and often influenced by the individual’s cultural and
religio-spiritual beliefs and biases. Patients felt that the
doctors19 were either unaware of or insensitive to their
cultural/spiritual needs. This perceived lack of empathy and
sensitivity made patients reluctant to voice their values and
preferences, causing them to shy away from EOL discus-
sions. While we need to train doctors19 to communicate with
empathy and cultural effectiveness, this is just one part of the
problem. The fragmented health system that mainly re-
imburses doctors for treatments and procedures is the un-
derlying larger problem in urgent need of an solution.
Fortunately, effective January 1, 2016, Medicare will pay for
30 minutes of ACP in a physcian’s office or in a hospital
(CPT billing code 99497). In both settings, Medicare will pay
for 30 additional minutes of consultation (add-on CPT billing
code 99498).
Barrier 3: Communication chasm between doctors
and patients.
The third biggest barrier identified by our
study subjects was the communication divide that exists be-
tween doctors and their patients. The main reasons19 fueling
the communication gap were (1) health literacy issues for most
patients and (2) language issues for patients with LEP. Cur-
rently, 36% of all Americans have basic or below-basic health
literacy. Older Americans are affected disproportionately by
limited health literacy in addition to having visual and hearing
deficits that make them extremely vulnerable.
In routine medical encounters, the patient’s health literacy
level, while important, is not critical, as these encounters
often do not require that patients make crucial decisions. For
example, when getting an antibiotic for an infection, the
patient is faced with limited or no choices and much of the
patient education emphasis is on the importance of treatment
adherence. EOL situations, however, are different in that they
require patients to take an active role, partner with their
doctors, and make complex and high-risk decisions in the
face of an uncertain future. This is best done using a Shared
Decision Making (SDM) 26 approach, a fact that is recog-
nized by ACA sections 3506 and 3021. In order for SDM to
work, doctors and patients need a common vocabulary to
discuss complex and sensitive EOL issues. In the event
EOLC decisions have to be conducted through a medical
interpreter due to a language barrier, the situation becomes
inordinately complex. Doctors need to become skilled at
explaining complicated medical issues19 in simple English
without losing the underlying nuances and complexity, so
that patients can make informed EOL choices. Patients need
both health literacy27,28 and numeracy skills to meaningfully
comprehend the various options available to them. It is im-
portant to make health education an integral part of high
school education, so that patients are better informed and able
to participate in their care.
Barrier 4: Family behaviors and beliefs.
Our study
participants identified their own family members as a barrier
for the patient receiving quality EOLC. Proxy decision makers
(heath care surrogates) when they disagree with the patient’s
choices can and do override patients’ stated wishes due to (1)
love for the patient and not being able to contemplate the
thought of losing the patient, (2) a sense of duty to protect the
patient from the health care system and ensure that they receive
all possible medical treatments available to them, (3) guilt
associated with refusing treatments that attempt to prolong life,
(4) the desire to have time to repair their relationship before the
patient dies, (5) religious/spiritual reasons that discourage
treatment refusal, or (6) secondary gain in some cases. Also, in
many states, the primacy of the surrogate decision maker is not
protected; i.e., other family members and stakeholders can and
do override the decisions both of the patient and the designated
surrogate, leading to tremendous conflict. As discussions about
EOL between the patient and family led to conflicts, our study
participants reported that they avoided these discussions. In
other cases, our participants reported instances when the
family members persuaded the patient to undergo burdensome
treatments that the patient did not want but acquiesced just to
please their family.
It is vital that patients learn to take the lead on the issue
of EOL decision making. While this is no easy task, the
physical, emotional, and fiscal toll of not doing so is very
high, as patients are at risk for being subjected to ineffec-
tive and burdensome treatments30 and procedures that they
do not want.
BARRIERS TO QUALITY OF EOL CARE
377
 Barrier 5: Health care system barriers.
Patients iden-
tified two types of health care system barriers: (1) Difficulties
accessing services and support for the care they needed:
With the growing doctor shortage, accessing medical care
can be challenging, especially doctors with palliative skills.
(2) Health care culture that is biased towards high-intensity
treatments even if ineffective: Patients and families reported
that when hospitalized, they were subjected to tests and
treatments at a very rapid pace, and that they did not under-
stand what these interventions were intended for. They
reported that the hospital staff often felt pressured to try to
prolong life even in the face of obvious terminal illness. This
resulted in dying patients being subjected to burdensome
treatments30 that were ineffective and took an enormous
emotional toll on the patient and family.
The ACA has implemented a pay-for-performance pro-
gram and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is
changing the way Medicare pays for hospital care by
rewarding hospitals for delivering services of higher quality
and higher value and reducing payments to acute care hos-
pitals with excessive readmissions. This program should also
screen for overtreatment of dying patients31 (for example,
providing chemotherapy for cancer patients with poor func-
tional status who have progression of disease after receiving
three consecutive regimens) and reduce payments for such
care. All doctors should be incentivized to become skilled in
primary palliative care so that they can incorporate palliative
principles into their practice.
Barrier 6: Cultural and religious barriers.
In many
ethnic cultures, death is a taboo topic,19 as patients and
families fear that speaking about death may invoke it. Pa-
tients belonging to certain religious and spiritual groups ex-
pressed the sentiment that death and dying are in the hands of
God and mere mortals should not be speculating about it or
tamper with the dying process. Some families reported be-
lieving in religious miracles and refused to entertain with-
drawal of life support even in imminently dying patients.
Others believed in redemptive suffering. Decreasing lifespan
by withholding or withdrawing life support was seen as fore-
going a God-given opportunity for redemption,18 and such
actions were deemed to be morally problematic. As EOL is-
sues are complicated by a complex interplay of medical,
spiritual, and existential issues, we need coordinated efforts of
an interdisciplinary team of experts including chaplains and
community faith leaders working in conjunction with medical
providers.
Our study is unique, as we used mixed methods to better
understand a complex and sensitive research question with
multiethnic participants. By conducting the study in seven
languages and using medical interpreters we were able to
engage an otherwise difficult to reach population of ethnic
persons with LEP about the sensitive topic of EOLC, which
has never been done before to the best of our knowledge. We
are limited by the fact that we recruited participants using a
snowball technique from only five cities in one state. Also,
our study is in part a qualitative study and thus methodo-
logically challenging to conduct nationally. However, it
is to be noted that we have followed the consolidated crite-
ria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ)32 guidelines
in conducting our study and in reporting our qualitative
findings.
Conclusions
Multiethnic patients report that receiving high-quality
EOLC is important to them, but also state that persons from
their cultural/ethnic/racial group have encountered barriers to
receiving such care. We have empirically identified the six
primary barriers reported by multiethnic patients preventing
them from receiving high-quality EOLC. As the United
States is becoming increasingly ethnically diverse and as
ethnic patients have been shown to consume ineffective and
burdensome high-intensity treatments at the EOL, there is an
urgent need to train and support doctors and allied health
professionals in conducting culturally effective EOL con-
versations early in the trajectory of any chronic and serious
illness in order to facilitate dignity33,34 at the EOL for diverse
Americans. There is an equally urgent need to educate and
support35 Americans to proactively participate in EOLC
planning. Finally, health care payments should be linked to
quality of care at the EOL.
