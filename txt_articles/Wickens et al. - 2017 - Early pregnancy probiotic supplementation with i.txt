Abstract
The study aims to assess whether supplementation with the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (HN001) can reduce the prevalence of
gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel trial was conducted in New Zealand (NZ)
(Wellington and Auckland). Pregnant women with a personal or partner history of atopic disease were randomised at 14–16 weeks’ gestation
to receive HN001 (6 × 109 colony-forming units) (n 212) or placebo (n 211) daily. GDM at 24–30 weeks was assessed using the definition of
the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) (fasting plasma glucose ≥5·1 mmol/l, or 1 h post 75 g glucose
level at ≥10 mmol/l or at 2 h ≥8·5 mmol/l) and NZ definition (fasting plasma glucose ≥5·5 mmol/l or 2 h post 75 g glucose at ≥9 mmol/l). All
analyses were intention-to-treat. A total of 184 (87 %) women took HN001 and 189 (90 %) women took placebo. There was a trend towards
lower relative rates (RR) of GDM (IADPSG definition) in the HN001 group, 0·59 (95 % CI 0·32, 1·08) (P = 0·08). HN001 was associated with
lower rates of GDM in women aged ≥35 years (RR 0·31; 95 % CI 0·12, 0·81, P = 0·009) and women with a history of GDM (RR 0·00; 95 % CI
0·00, 0·66, P = 0·004). These rates did not differ significantly from those of women without these characteristics. Using the NZ definition, GDM
prevalence was significantly lower in the HN001 group, 2·1 % (95 % CI 0·6, 5·2), v. 6·5 % (95 % CI 3·5, 10·9) in the placebo group (P = 0·03).
HN001 supplementation from 14 to 16 weeks’ gestation may reduce GDM prevalence, particularly among older women and those with
previous GDM.

Lifestyle factors such as changes in patterns of food consumption
with economic development have led to the well-recognised and
increasing problems of obesity and associated diseases, including
gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), both in New Zealand (NZ)(1)
and other developed countries(2). Pre-pregnancy overweight and
obesity have been shown to account for 46 % of GDM(3), with
excess weight gain during pregnancy, previous GDM or a family
history of diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), older age
and higher parity also identified as risk factors(4). GDM itself
increases the risk for preeclampsia, miscarriage, preterm birth,
macrosomia, induction of labour and caesarean section(2,3). GDM
also increases the risk for later maternal and child obesity and
subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus(5).
GDM definitions are variable, and establishing an inter-
national consensus on diagnostic criteria that predict adverse
pregnancy outcomes has been challenging. In 2008, the Inter-
national Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group
(IADPSG)(6) used data from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse
Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study(7) to develop recommen-
dations for oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) threshold glucose
concentrations for the diagnosis of GDM (fasting plasma
glucose ≥5·1 mmol/l or 1 h post 75 g glucose level ≥10 mmol/l
or at 2 h ≥8·5 mmol/l). This was based on the findings of the
HAPO study(7) of a curvilinear dose–response relationship
between fasting, 1 and 2 h glucose concentrations and adverse
pregnancy outcomes, including macrosomia and caesarean

 section delivery. However, the NZ guideline definitions for
GDM diagnosis specify a higher baseline and 2 h glucose test
threshold (fasting plasma glucose ≥5·5 mmol/l or 2 h post
75 g glucose level ≥9 mmol/l)(1).
The WHO has defined probiotics as live micro-organisms,
which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health
benefit to the host(8). There is emerging evidence for a modu-
lating effect of probiotics on gut microbiota and inflammatory
responses(9,10), with a recent meta-analysis suggesting that
probiotics can favourably influence glucose metabolism(11).
A Finnish trial(12) showed that a probiotic supplement con-
taining Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis
Bb12, taken from the first trimester of pregnancy, reduced the
prevalence of GDM.
The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the
probiotic L. rhamnosus HN001 (HN001) taken by pregnant
mothers from early pregnancy could reduce the prevalence of
GDM by 26–28 weeks’ gestation.
Methods
Study design
The
study
was
a
two-centre,
double-blind,
randomised,
placebo-controlled parallel trial investigating the effects of the
probiotic HN001 on the prevalence of GDM. This secondary
outcome was decided a priori. The primary outcome was the
development of eczema and atopic sensitisation in the child
at age 12 months (Australia NZ Clinical Trials Registry:
ACTRN12612000196842).
For a detailed description of study methods and outcomes
refer to Barthow et al.(13).
Participants
In brief, pregnant women in Auckland and Wellington, NZ,
were recruited into the study via health professionals and
study information placed in pregnancy packs. Women were
considered eligible if they were <16 weeks’ gestation, English-
speaking, had intention to breast-feed, and if either they or
the unborn child’s biological father had a history of asthma,
hayfever
or
eczema
requiring
medication.
Women
were
excluded from the study if aged <16 years, were planning
to move outside the study centres during the study duration,
had a history of immunological disorders or medication, or
cardiac valve disease, required in vitro fertilisation, had major
fetal abnormalities, were using probiotic drinks or supplements,
participating in another randomised controlled trial, refused
notification of their clinical carers, carried adrenaline for
cows’ milk allergy, had a history of a transplant or HIV, had
used continuous antibiotic therapy for at least 3 months,
miscarried between screening and enrolment, or were other-
wise deemed unsuitable. Eligible women were enrolled into
the study at 14–16 weeks’ gestation, where gestation was
determined on the basis of the earliest first-trimester scan
and, where this was not available, the date of the last
menstrual period.
Study capsules
Participating women were randomised to receive capsules
containing either HN001 (6 × 109 colony-forming units (cfu)) or
placebo (maize-derived maltodextrin, identical in appearance
and smell to the probiotic) to be taken daily from enrolment
throughout pregnancy and until 6 months post birth if still
breast-feeding. HN001 powder was manufactured by Fonterra
Co-operative Group Ltd (Fonterra) using aseptic fermentation,
concentration and freeze-drying, as previously described(14).
The placebo powder, maize-derived maltodextrin, was manu-
factured by Grain Processing Corporation. Women were
instructed to keep the capsules in a refrigerator and to avoid
taking them within 10 min of consuming hot food or fluid.
Fonterra retained samples of capsules at 4°C, which were
tested monthly to ensure viability of the contents over time. The
viability of the contents of a selection of unused capsules
returned from the field was tested 3 monthly. Loss in viability
was <0·1 log, and within the limit of uncertainty of the
counting method.
Randomisation of capsules was performed by a statistician at
Fonterra who had no contact with the study investigators or
participants. Randomisation was stratified by the study centre
and performed in blocks of twenty according to a computer-
generated randomisation schedule and an allocation ratio of
1:1. Research staff screened and enrolled participants, providing
eligible participants with the next available sequentially num-
bered capsule container. All researchers, laboratory staff and
participants were blinded to study allocation.
Baseline
Information collected included age, ethnicity, parity, previous
PCOS, BMI (weight (kg)/height (m2)), waist circumference,
antibiotic use during pregnancy but before enrolment and
type 2 diabetes mellitus in the participant or a first-degree
relative. Among women with previous pregnancies >20 weeks,
we also collected a history of previous GDM and birth weight of
previous babies.
Outcomes
The GDM outcome was defined a priori primarily as the diag-
nosis of GDM according to the IADPSG recommendations(6):
a fasting plasma glucose ≥5·1 mmol/l, or 1 h post 75 g glucose
load ≥10 mmol/l or at 2 h ≥8·5 mmol/l. A secondary analysis
was
conducted
using
NZ
thresholds
≥5·5 mmol/l
fasting
or ≥9 mmol/l at 2 h to define GDM(1).
The assessment for GDM was conducted at 24–30 weeks’
gestation following a 12 h overnight fast, using a GTT under-
taken at a community laboratory. Only women without pre-
pregnancy diabetes were invited to undertake a study GTT.
Women who received a GTT-based diagnosis of GDM before
the study GTT were included in the study outcome only if there
was evidence of earlier negative tests confirming that their
diabetes was gestational. When repeat GTTs were performed
later in pregnancy (for clinical purposes), the test completed
at 24–30 weeks’ gestation determined their study GDM status.

 Women with GDM were asked to have a postpartum HbA1c
measured at least 3 months after birth. A postpartum HbA1c
level ≥6·5 % (48 mmol/mol) or a postpartum fasting glucose
≥7 mmol/l and/or 2 h glucose ≥11·1 mmol/l was used to indi-
cate the presence of co-existing type 2 diabetes. If women met
these criteria they were excluded from the GDM analysis.
We collected other outcomes at 4–7 d post birth, including
maternal weight (kg) and waist circumference (cm), gestation
(in weeks) and prematurity (<37 weeks). Infant Apgar score
at 5 min and birth weight were collected from medical
records. Infant length (cm), ponderal index (PI) (birth weight
(kg)/length (m3)), head circumference (cm), type of delivery
(vaginal or caesarean) and admission to the neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU) were assessed by the researcher at 4–7 d
post birth.
Adherence
More than 3 months’ supply of capsules (n 105) were placed in
each bottle. Bottles were replaced at 26–28 weeks’ gestation and
birth, at which time two bottles were given to the mother to cover
the period up to 6 months post birth. Returned capsules were
counted by staff not involved in the study assessments, and
adherence rates (number taken/time period) were calculated.
Power
Assuming a 15 % prevalence of GDM, a 63 % reduction due to
the probiotic, as found in a Finnish study(12), and a sample size
of 195 in each group, the study would have 87 % power at the
5 % level of significance.
Statistical analysis
Analysis was performed using SAS 9.3 and 9.4 (SAS Institute).
All analyses were intention-to-treat. Differences between the
treatment groups in the prevalence of GDM and dichotomous
birth outcomes were estimated using relative rates (RR) and
95 % CI. Although not pre-specified, we conducted an analysis
of GDM stratified by factors that were significantly associated
with GDM (maternal age, BMI, a history of GDM) and by
antibiotic use during the study before the GTT using a gene-
ralised linear model with a log-link and binomial distribution.
For continuous variables, differences between treatment groups
are reported as differences in means (95 % CI) compared
using t tests, or as ratios of geometric means (95 %CI) compared
using ANCOVA on logged values, adjusted for logged baseline
measures; other differences were compared with Wilcoxon’s
rank-sum tests. The Apgar score was compared between
groups using ordinal logistic regression. Tests were two-sided
and P < 0·05 was considered statistically significant.
Missing GTT measurements were estimated with 1000 mul-
tiple imputations using treatment, fasting, 1 and 2 h measure-
ments, ethnicity, age, BMI at enrolment, a family history
of diabetes in first-degree relatives, previous PCOS, and the
combination of previous GDM and number of previous preg-
nancies of >20 weeks’ gestation (grouped as no previous
pregnancies, one previous pregnancy with GDM or one
previous pregnancy without GDM, two or more previous
pregnancies with GDM or two or more previous pregnancies
without GDM). One participant who did not undergo the
GTT because she had been diagnosed with GDM and
prescribed insulin from early pregnancy was assumed to have
GDM in all imputations.
This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid
down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures
involving human subjects were approved by the Multi-Region
Health and Disability Ethics Committee. Written informed
consent was obtained from all subjects. The trial was registered at
the Australia NZ Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12612000196842,

Results
Participants (n 423) were randomised to the HN001 (n 212) or
placebo group (n 211) between December 2012 and November
2014 at an average rate of 4·2 a week. Gestational diabetes
assessments were completed by February 2015 and the final
infant was born in May 2015. Loss-to-follow-up rates were
similar between study groups, but more participants in the
HN001 group had discontinued the intervention before the GTT
(Fig. 1). In contrast, most participants lost to follow-up between
the GTT and birth visits were in the placebo group, with small
numbers discontinuing the intervention in both study groups.
There was one maternal death in the placebo group due to
a subarachnoid haemorrhage.
Median adherence rates were 94·9 % (interquartile range
(IQR) 85·7–98·8 %) (n 179) in the HN001 group and 94·0 %
(IQR 85·9–98·8 %) (n 183) in the placebo group (Wilcoxon’s
rank-sum test, P = 0·59).
Among randomised participants, the 24–30-week GTT results
included all three time points (fasting, 1 h and 2 h values, as
required by IADPSG guideline definitions) in 184 (87 %) parti-
cipants in the HN001 group and 189 (90 %) in the placebo
group, at mean 27·7 (SD 4·6) and 28·0 (SD 8·6) weeks’ gestation,
respectively. An additional ten HN001 participants and eleven
placebo participants had only the fasting and 2-h time-point
GTT results available, which were sufficient for a diagnosis of
GDM by standard NZ guidelines. A total of 194 (92 %) in the
HN001 group and 200 (95 %) in the placebo group participated
in either GTT assessment, all of whom were able to contribute
data to the analysis on the basis of NZ guidelines.
There were no substantial differences between the study
groups in any maternal characteristic at enrolment, including
age, ethnicity, parity, weight, waist, BMI, antibiotic use or
corticosteroid use during pregnancy before enrolment, family
history of diabetes, household income, maternal smoking or
maternal treated allergic disease (asthma, eczema or hayfever),
and among those with previous births, weight of largest infant
and having a history of GDM (Table 1).
The prevalence of GDM (defined using the IADPSG criteria)
in the HN001 group was lower than that in the placebo group,
but this difference was not statistically significant (Table 2).
However, using the more specific NZ definition, the prevalence

 of GDM was significantly lower in the HN001 group. There
were three participants in the HN001 group and five in the
placebo group using oral or injected corticosteroids between
enrolment and the GTT (P = 0·48). Among this small number of
participants there was no increased risk for gestational diabetes
(data not shown). Adjustment for systemic corticosteroid use
during this time period made only minimal differences to the
treatment effects on gestational diabetes for both the IADPSG
(RR 0·59; 95 % CI 0·32, 1·08) and the NZ (RR 0·31; 95 % CI 0·10,
0·95) guidelines. These analyses were repeated with imputed
results for missing values but there was little change in the RR
estimates. Using the IADPSG guidelines the imputed RR = 0·64
(95 % CI 0·36, 1·11), and using the NZ guidelines imputed
RR = 0·33 (95 % CI 0·11, 0·99).
The mean blood glucose levels at baseline and after 1 and 2 h
were slightly lower in the HN001 group compared with the
placebo group, but were significant only at baseline (Table 2).
Among forty-four participants diagnosed with GDM according
to either the NZ or IADPSG guidelines, forty participants had
HbA1c measured between 1 and 15 months post birth, with
values between 5·0 % (31 mmol/mol) and 6·4 % (46 mmol/mol).
One participant had a post-birth GTT, with values within the
normal range. Three participants did not have post-birth HbA1c
measured because one had declined, one had withdrawn from
the study, and one had died.
Table 3 shows that only maternal age, BMI and having a
history of GDM were significantly associated with GDM in this
study. These factors were then used to stratify the analysis
(Fig. 2) using only the IADPSG definition of GDM, as this
definition reflects our a priori hypothesis. There was a
significant treatment-by-age (as a continuous variable) interac-
tion (P = 0·005) and a non-significant interaction with age
dichotomised as ≥35 v. <35 years (Pinteraction = 0·06). In the
older group, HN001 was associated with a 3-fold reduction in
the prevalence of GDM compared with the prevalence among
women in the placebo group (RR 0·31; 95 % CI 0·12, 0·81,
P = 0·009). In women aged <35 years the prevalence in each
study group was similar (RR 1·04; 95% CI 0·45, 2·39). There were

 also no significant differences in effect dependent on whether
BMI was ≥30 kg/m2 (RR 0·86; 95 % CI 0·37, 1·96), or <30 kg/m2
(RR 0·51; 95 % CI 0·22, 1·17) (Pinteraction 0·39). GDM did not recur
in any of the HN001 participants who had a history of GDM.
Thus, we could not test for an interaction effect. Among those
with a history of GDM, HN001 protected against a recurrence of
GDM, RR = 0·00 (95% CI 0·00, 0·66), and for those without pre-
vious GDM, RR = 0·50 (95 % CI 0·20, 1·27). Three women (20 %)
with a history of GDM did not complete the GTT according to the
IADSPG guidelines. In all imputations, these were GDM positive,
giving an imputed RR = 0·38 (95 % CI 0·05, 1·00, P = 0·043,
Barnard’s exact test). As HN001 is susceptible to a range of
antibiotics(15), we examined the effect of HN001 on GDM by use
of antibiotics between study enrolment and the GTT test. The
HN001 effect on GDM was significantly protective among
participants who had not used antibiotics between study enrol-
ment and the GTT test but there was no significant effect of
HN001 for those who had used antibiotics during this period
(Pinteraction = 0·10).
Similarly, among those not using antibiotics, fasting mean
blood glucose levels were significantly lower (P= 0·001) in
the HN001 group (4·28; 95 % CI 4·23, 4·33) compared with
that in the placebo group (4·42; 95 % CI 4·35, 4·48). Differences in
mean glucose levels at 1 and 2 h post glucose load were
also lower but were not significant. At 1 h, blood glucose
levels were 6·63 (95 % CI 6·37, 6·89) in the HN001 group
and 6·88 (95 % CI 6·60, 7·16) in the placebo group (P= 0·20), and
at 2 h the levels were 5·56 (95 % CI 5·38, 5·73) in the HN001 group
and 5·77 (95 % CI 5·53, 6·01) in the placebo group (P = 0·15).
HN001 was not significantly associated with any maternal
anthropometric measures (after adjustment for baseline mea-
surements), or infant birth weight, gestation, caesarean delivery
or admission to the NICU or, at 4–7 d post birth, infant length, PI
or head circumference. Infants whose mothers were in the
HN001 group had a significantly higher 5-min Apgar score than
did infants in the placebo group (Table 4).
GDM in the mother, defined according to the IADPSG
recommendations,
was
associated
with
higher
maternal
weight (P = 0·0002), waist circumference (P < 0·0001) and BMI
(P < 0·0001) post birth but was not associated with any infant
anthropometric measures, gestation, caesarean delivery, NICU
admission or Apgar score at 5 min (data not shown).
Discussion
As far as we are aware, this is the first study to report a role for
probiotics in preventing GDM among women not selected on
the basis of risk for GDM. Our data suggest that the probiotic
HN001 at a dose of 6 × 109 cfu/d may lower the rate of GDM
from 13·8 to 8·2 %, a 40 % reduction using the IADPSG guide-
lines(6) or a 68 % reduction from 6·5 to 2·1 % using the NZ
guidelines. Differences in mean blood glucose levels were small
at baseline, and at 1 and 2 h post glucose load. Nevertheless,
these differences in absolute values correspond to the differ-
ence in GDM prevalence we found using thresholds.
The HN001 protective effect on GDM (defined using the
IADPSG criteria) found in this study was weaker than the pro-
biotic effect on GDM found among women at risk for GDM in
Finland(12), but older women and women with a history of
GDM had similar risks to the at-risk Finnish population. This
Finnish study intervened from the first trimester of pregnancy
with a combination of two probiotics (L. rhamnosus GG and
B. lactis Bb12) and reported a significant reduction in GDM
prevalence from 36 to 13 % due to the probiotics. Both active
and placebo groups also had a dietary intervention. It is
possible that the probiotics interacted with diet to enhance
protection against GDM, or that the combination of the two
probiotics used in the Finnish study was more effective than

 HN001 alone. The higher prevalence of GDM in the Finnish trial
may be a consequence of limiting the test to an at-risk
sub-group and the different diagnostic thresholds applicable
in Finland at that time (≥4·8 mmol/l at baseline, ≥10 mmol/l
at 1 h, or ≥8·7 mmol/l at 2 h)(12). Applying the Finnish at-risk
criteria(16) to our study population, at least 58 % of the women
would have been at risk, and applying the Finnish GDM diag-
nostic criteria to these women at risk, 27 % of women in the
placebo group and 22 % of women in the HN001 group would
have been classified as having GDM. In smaller studies, Lindsay
et al. have shown no significant effect of Lactobacillus
salivarius UCC118 on fasting glucose levels among obese
women when taken between 24 and 28 weeks’ gestation(17) or
as a 4–6-week treatment for women with either impaired
glucose tolerance or GDM(18). This may indicate that this
particular strain of probiotic is an ineffective intervention for
prevention or treatment of GDM, or that the intervention period
was too short or too late in pregnancy to observe an effect, or
the studies lacked statistical power.
Our study showed that the HN001 effect was stronger using
the higher NZ glucose thresholds than the IADPSG thresholds
to define GDM, suggesting that the effect is greater in
preventing more severe GDM.
Taking one or more systemic antibiotic courses during the
same period as the HN001 may negate any effect of HN001 on
GDM, with benefits of taking HN001 found only among those
who did not require antibiotics. However, because of the small
percentage (11 %) taking antibiotics, the study had low power
to assess differences in HN001 effect dependent on antibiotic
use (P = 0·10). There was a similar strengthening effect of
HN001 on blood glucose levels, particularly at baseline, after
excluding those taking antibiotics. These data might indicate
the deleterious effect that antibiotics have on gut microbiota
composition
and
function(19),
possibly
compromising
the
viability of HN001.

 NICU were also unaffected by HN001, findings that are
consistent with other studies(12,17). One explanation for a lack
of effect may be that maternal use of medication or dietary/
exercise regimens to reduce blood glucose levels could have
obscured any effect of untreated GDM on post-birth measures
in the infant or the mother. The effects of antibiotics on the gut
microbiota if taken during the third trimester, but before labour,
could also have obscured an effect. However, removal of the
13 % using systemic antibiotics during this period had little
impact on the associations of HN001 with anthropometric
measures. Assuming this discrepancy between an HN001 effect
on GDM but not on anthropometric measures at birth is not
explained by obstetric interventions to limit excessive weight
gain, there may be a mechanism whereby HN001 has an effect
on blood sugar levels but not on maternal weight.
There was a significant (P = 0·04) beneficial effect of HN001
on the 5-min Apgar score, possibly due to chance given the
number of comparisons performed.
The gut microbiota is profoundly altered during the three
trimesters of pregnancy towards a less diverse state, with the
most depleted microbial richness found in women with
GDM(20). In contrast to obesity-related gut microbiota, the last-
trimester gut microbiota has been associated with greater
amounts of energy lost in stool compared with the first
trimester, indicating that the impact of gut microbiota alterations
during pregnancy on host adiposity and host glucose metabo-
lism is not necessarily identical(20). We speculate that HN001
supplementation altered the composition and function of the
gut microbiota in favour of improved insulin sensitivity and
inflammation in the host, which reduced the propensity
towards GDM.
The lack of any deleterious effect on birth outcomes supports
HN001 as a safe intervention to take from early pregnancy
(14–16 weeks’ gestation), which may also be beneficial to the
infant, as reflected by the Apgar score. These findings are
important given the small amount of data available on effects of
early-pregnancy probiotic interventions.
A limitation of our study is that we did not collect maternal
anthropometric measures at the time of the GTT. We were also
unable to measure pre-pregnancy maternal anthropometric
measures, and hence changes in maternal weight and waist
circumference during pregnancy were based on measurements
taken at enrolment (14–16 weeks’ gestation), when differences
may already reflect a change from pre-pregnancy weight.
However, women are recommended to gain less than 2 kg in
their first trimester(21), and many women gain considerably
less(22). Given the smaller reduction in GDM we found com-
pared with Luoto et al.(12), we may also have overestimated the
power of the study to find a difference by basing it on their
findings.

 The strengths of this study are the larger sample size and
good follow-up rates compared with previous studies, and
good generalisability because our population was not selected
for high risk for GDM. As underlying low-grade inflammation
may be a predisposing factor in obesity, diabetes and allergic
disease(23), our study population, selected to be at risk for
allergic disease, may also be at greater risk for diabetes. Further,
systemic corticosteroid use, most likely for asthma management
in our study population, may have increased the rate of insulin
resistance and gestational diabetes(24). However, it is unlikely
that these factors explain our study findings, given that the 6·5 %
prevalence of GDM in the placebo group is representative of
the NZ prevalence(1) and corticosteroid use was not associated
with increased gestational diabetes for either GDM definition.
The generalisability of the study may also be compromised
because women self-selected for study may be better educated
and have higher incomes than women not included in the
study. However, these factors are unlikely to be associated
with an HN001 effect.
We were also able to exclude the possibility that women with
undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus were misclassified as
GDM by measuring their postpartum HbA1c or GTT. Most of
these women (40/44) underwent postpartum evaluation of
their glycaemic status but none met a level indicative of type 2
diabetes mellitus(25), suggesting that the cases of GDM are likely
to be gestational only.
Promoting good health in pregnancy through weight control
programmes or diet has been largely ineffective, partly due
to poor adherence with the interventions. If our results for
probiotics are confirmed in other larger trials, the promise of
a simple, cheap and safe intervention is an attractive option to
reduce the prevalence of GDM, which is increasing not only in
affluent countries but also in less-affluent countries as they
become more Westernised.
