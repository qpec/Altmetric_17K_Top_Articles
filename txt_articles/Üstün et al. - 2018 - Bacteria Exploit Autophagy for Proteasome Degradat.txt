Autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are two major protein degradation pathways implicated in the response
to microbial infections in eukaryotes. In animals, the contribution of autophagy and the UPS to antibacterial immunity is well
documented and several bacteria have evolved measures to target and exploit these systems to the benefit of infection. In
plants, the UPS has been established as a hub for immune responses and is targeted by bacteria to enhance virulence. However,
the role of autophagy during plant-bacterial interactions is less understood. Here, we have identified both pro- and antibacterial
functions of autophagy mechanisms upon infection of Arabidopsis thaliana with virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato
DC3000 (Pst). We show that Pst activates autophagy in a type III effector (T3E)-dependent manner and stimulates the autophagic
removal of proteasomes (proteaphagy) to support bacterial proliferation. We further identify the T3E Hrp outer protein M1
(HopM1) as a principle mediator of autophagy-inducing activities during infection. In contrast to the probacterial effects of Pst-
induced proteaphagy, NEIGHBOR OF BRCA1-dependent selective autophagy counteracts disease progression and limits the
formation of HopM1-mediated water-soaked lesions. Together, we demonstrate that distinct autophagy pathways contribute to
host immunity and bacterial pathogenesis during Pst infection and provide evidence for an intimate crosstalk between
proteasome and autophagy in plant-bacterial interactions.
INTRODUCTION
Autophagyisamajordegradationandrecyclingpathwayineukaryotes
that directs the bulk or selective engulfment of cytoplasmic content
into double membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, for sub-
sequentturnover(KlionskyandCodogno,2013).Thesequentialsteps
of autophagosome formation and delivery to lytic compartments (i.e.,
vacuole or lysosome) rely on a complex set of membrane trafficking
and fusion events and involve the coordinated action of conserved
autophagy-related (ATG) proteins (Yin et al., 2016; Reggiori and
Ungermann, 2017; Yu et al., 2017). For instance, two ubiquitin-like
conjugation pathways produce ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 complexes
and lipidated ATG8 proteinsrequired for the expansion and sealing of
the isolation membrane (or phagophore) around the nearby cellular
cargo (Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011). In addition, membrane-
anchored ATG8 acts as an important docking site for selective au-
tophagyreceptorsthatdeliveramultitudeofsubstratestothegrowing
autophagosome, including single or aggregated proteins, entire or-
ganelles, and invading microbes (Zaffagnini and Martens, 2016). In
plants, NEIGHBOR OF BRCA1 (NBR1) is the best characterized
cargoreceptorandfunctionsinthedegradationofpolyubiquitinated
protein aggregates (aggrephagy) as well as viral components and
particles (xenophagy) (Svenning et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2013;
Hafrén et al., 2017, 2018). Recent findings also revealed that the
ubiquitin-binding proteasome subunit REGULATORY PARTICLE
NON-ATPASE SUBUNIT10 (RPN10) acts as a specific autophagy
receptor for the degradation of proteasomes (proteaphagy) in re-
sponsetochemicalorgeneticproteasomeinhibition(Marshalletal.,
2015). This interplay between both major cellular degradation
pathways appears to be conserved in other eukaryotes as mal-
functioning proteasomes are also degraded in yeast and mammals,
albeit via different cargo receptors (Cohen-Kaplan et al., 2016;
Marshall et al., 2016).
Altered expression of ATG and cargo receptor genes has been
widely explored to dissect the functions and mechanisms of
autophagy processes. These studies have established important
roles for autophagy in cellular homeostasis, development, me-
tabolism, and stress adaptation in various eukaryotic organisms
(Boya et al., 2013; Klionsky and Codogno, 2013). In addition,
autophagy is induced in response to a wide range of pathogens
and contributes to various aspects of adaptive and innate im-
munity during animal infections (Levine et al., 2011; Gomes and
Dikic, 2014). In turn, several intracellular viruses and bacteria
have evolved measures to suppress and evade antimicrobial

 autophagy or even hijack autophagic processes for enhanced
pathogenicity (Dong and Levine, 2013; Mostowy, 2013). In plants,
autophagywasinitiallyascribedtotheregulationofthehypersensitive
response as part of effector-triggered immunity against avirulent
oomycete,viral,andbacterialpathogens(Liuetal.,2005;Hofiusetal.,
2009; Kwon et al., 2013; Han et al., 2015). Subsequently, autophagy
was shown to be involved in basal resistance and the control of
disease-associated cell death upon infection with necrotrophic fungi
(Laietal.,2011;Lenzetal.,2011;Lietal.,2016).Theidentificationofan
ATG8-interacting oomycete effector that antagonizes the NBR1
autophagy receptor further indicated an important role of selective
autophagy in defense responses (Dagdas et al., 2016). In support of
this notion, NBR1 was also found to function in antiviral immunity by
targeting the viral capsid protein and particles of Cauliflower mosaic
virus (CaMV) for xenophagic degradation (Hafrén et al., 2017).
However,NBR1-independentbulkautophagypromoteshostsurvival
during CaMV infection and thus serves as a proviral pathway by
extending the time span for particle production and potential vector
transmission (Hafrén et al., 2017).
Despite recent advances in the understanding of autophagy
during compatible interactions of plants with oomycetes, fungi,
and viruses (Zhou et al., 2014; Hofius et al., 2017), the functions of
bulk and selective autophagy pathways upon virulent bacterial
infection remained unclear. Autophagy-deficient Arabidopsis
thaliana mutants such as atg5 were previously shown to display
enhanced resistance to infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv
tomato DC3000 (Pst). This phenotype has been linked to a po-
tential,asyetunknownroleofautophagyinthenegativeregulation
ofsalicylic acid(SA)levelsanddefensesignaling (Yoshimotoetal.,
2009; Lenz et al., 2011). Notably, Pst secretes several type III
effector (T3E) proteins to suppress proteasome activity and block
SA signaling (Üstün et al., 2016), probably mediated by the im-
paired turnover of the defense regulator NONEXPRESSOR OF
PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1 (NPR1),asseenduringXanthomonas
campestris infection (Üstün et al., 2013; Üstün and Börnke, 2015).
These findings imply a potential crosstalk between autophagy and
proteasome functions during bacterial infections, the specifics
of which are not yet known.
In this study, we investigated whether and how Pst alters au-
tophagy responses to interfere with host immunity and enhance
pathogenicity in Arabidopsis. Our results show that Pst induces
autophagy and increases autophagic flux upon delivery of the T3E
HopM1. We further demonstrate that HopM1 stimulates pro-
teaphagy, thus providing the mechanistic basis for Pst-mediated
inhibition of proteasome function that suppresses immune re-
sponses in plants. While Pst-induced autophagy promotes bac-
terial proliferation, NBR1-mediated selective autophagic processes
seem to counteract it by suppressing the formation of HopM1-
induced water-soaked lesions. Our data indicate that distinct se-
lective autophagy pathways operate simultaneously during virulent
P. syringae infection and have opposing functions in plant immunity
and bacterial pathogenesis.

 first assayed whether the previously observed impact of Pst on
proteasome function (Üstün et al., 2016) is altered in Arabidopsis
mutants defective in the core autophagy machinery. As expected,
Pst infection inhibited proteasome activity in Col-0 wild-type
plants, determined by cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide (Suc-
LLVY-AMC) via the 20S proteasome. This suppressive effect was
reversed in atg5-1 (Figure 1A), atg2-1, and atg7-2 null mutant
plants (Supplemental Figure 1A), leading to a higher proteasome
activity upon infection compared with Col-0. Notably, loss of
function of NPR1 or the SA biosynthetic gene SALICYLIC ACID
INDUCTION DEFICIENT2 (SID2) in atg5-1 npr1-1 and atg5-1 sid2
double mutants did not change the proteasome response to Pst
infection compared with atg5-1, indicating that the phenotype
occurs independently of SA levels and SA-mediated defense
signaling (Supplemental Figure 1B). We then analyzed the
accumulation of the proteasome subunit PBA1, whose post-
translational cleavage at the N terminus is blocked upon chemical
or bacterial suppression of proteasome activity and maturation
(Book et al., 2010; Üstün et al., 2016). The unprocessed form of
PBA1 was still detectable in the atg5-1 mutant but accumulated to
a substantially lower amount compared with Col-0 (Figure 1B),
supporting the observed inability of Pst to reduce proteasome
activity in the autophagy-deficient background. Furthermore,
accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins during Pst infection was
increased in atg5 relative to Col-0 (Figure 1B), indicating that Pst
stimulates autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated target pro-
teins. Finally, the enhanced resistance phenotype ofatg5 plants to
Pst infection (Lenz et al., 2011) was reverted by introducing the
proteasome subunit loss-of-function mutations rpt2a-2 and
rpn12a-1 (Kurepa et al., 2008) (Figure 1C). Collectively, these
results show that Pst-induced proteasome inactivation to en-
hance virulence (Üstün et al., 2016) is dependent on a functional
autophagy pathway.
Pst-Induced Autophagy Promotes Plant Susceptibility
The requirement of autophagy for Pst-induced proteasome sup-
pression in Arabidopsis prompted us to investigate whether auto-
phagy is induced during Pst infection. We first monitored the
expression of the autophagy core gene ATG8a and the selective
autophagy receptor NBR1, which represent well-established
markers for the autophagy response (Thompson et al., 2005; Zhou
etal.,2013;Hafrénetal.,2017).Transcriptlevelsofbothgeneswere
increased upon bacterial infection (Figure 2A), with ATG8a showing
an earlier accumulation compared with NBR1. Importantly, the
steady state level of NBR1 protein appeared diminished during Pst
infection, suggesting enhanced NBR1 turnover (Figure 2B). Indeed,
stabilization of NBR1 by treatment with concanamycin A (ConA),
an inhibitor of vacuolar acidification and hence autophagic body
degradation, verified Pst-induced enhancement of autophagic
flux (Svenning et al., 2011; Minina et al., 2013). We then infected
a transgenic line expressing GFP-ATG8a and found that Pst
stimulated the formation of GFP-labeled autophagosomal struc-
turescomparedwiththenoninfectedcontrol(Figure2C).Inaddition,
we monitored by immunoblotting the release of free GFP from the
GFP-ATG8a fusion protein, which serves as marker for vacuolar
turnover of autophagic bodies (Chung et al., 2010). Detection of an
increased free GFP/GFP-ATG8a ratio at early and particularly at

 later stages of infection (24 h postinoculation [hpi]) compared with
the mock control further indicated an enhanced autophagy activity
and flux upon Pst challenge (Figure 2D).
To assess the relevance of stimulated autophagy during in-
fection, we determined bacterial growth in plants treated with
AZD8055, an inhibitor of the negativeautophagyregulator TARGET
OFRAPAMYCIN (TOR), which isknown to promote autophagic flux
(Liu and Bassham, 2010; Pu et al., 2017; Supplemental Figure 2).
Pst growth was slightly but significantly enhanced by AZD8055-
mediated autophagy activation in Col-0 plants (Figure 2E),
whereas inhibitor treatment did not affect bacterial proliferation
in atg5-1 (Supplemental Figure 3). To further exclude autophagy-
independent TOR signaling effects on the altered resistance
response, we analyzed bacterial growth in ATG5 overexpressing
Arabidopsis plants that show constitutive upregulation of au-
tophagy (Minina et al., 2018). Consistent with the results from the
AZD8055 inhibitor treatment, we observed significantly increased
proliferation of Pst in independent transgenic lines compared
with the wild-type control (Figure 2F). Together, these data show
that Pst-induced autophagy promotes bacterial susceptibility in
Arabidopsis.
Pst Effector Proteins Drive Autophagy Induction
We next addressed whether Pst triggers autophagy through
the activity of T3E proteins. T3Es are delivered into the plant cell
to suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-
triggered immunity and to manipulate other cellular functions for
enhanced virulence (Macho, 2016). We therefore analyzed the
autophagy responses to nonpathogenic PstDhrcC, a mutant
strain defective in the T3 secretion system and thus incapable of
effector translocation. In contrastto wild-type Pst, NBR1 protein
levels were slightly increased upon infection with PstDhrcC and
showedonlyaminorresponse to ConA treatmentcomparableto
that of the mock control (Figure 3A). In addition, PstDhrc in-
fection did not further increase NBR1 accumulation in the atg5
mutant background as detected for the wild-type strain (Figure
3B). Transcriptional upregulation of ATG8a upon infection with
PstDhrcC was reduced compared with Pst, while NBR1 ex-
pression was increased only at early infection time points,
possibly explaining the elevated NBR1 protein levels at steady
state (Figure 3C). Furthermore, autophagosomal structures
labeled with GFP-ATG8a were only slightly enhanced (Figure
3D), and accumulation of the GFP-ATG8a fusion protein as well
as free GFP release was hardly affected by PstDhrcC in com-
parison to the mock control (Figure 3E). This minor autophagic
response upon PstDhrcC challenge suggests that autophagy is
stimulated by the delivery of T3Es. Indeed, treatment with the
bacterial PAMP flg22 or heat-inactivated wild-type Pst did not in-
duce the formation of GFP-ATG8a puncta to similar levels as seen
upon Pst infection (Supplemental Figure 4). Together, these results
indicate that Pst-induced enhancement of autophagy is mediated
by T3Es and is part of a bacterial virulence strategy.
The Pst Effector HopM1 Mediates Autophagy Activation
To identify potential T3Es that are responsible for autophagy
modulation, we utilized a quantitative autophagy assay in the
Nicotiana benthamiana system. This assay is based on the
Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression of
Renilla luciferase (RLUC) fused to ATG8a together with free
Firefly luciferase (FLUC). While RLUC-ATG8a is sequestered
into autophagosomes and targeted for vacuolar degradation,
cytoplasmic FLUC serves as an internal reference for protein
expression. The readout of autophagic flux is derived from the
ratio of RLUC-ATG8a to FLUC levels and compared in the
presence or absence of the coexpressed effector protein.
Based on our observation that Pst-induced proteasome sup-
pression requires autophagy, we speculated that effector
proteins previously identified as suppressors of proteasome
activity (Üstün et al., 2016) might equally well be autophagy
modulators. We therefore selected HopM1 as a candidate,
given that it has the strongest proteasome inhibiting capacity
(Üstün et al., 2016) and suppresses SA-dependent defense
responses (DebRoy et al., 2004). Measurement of luciferase
activities in N. benthamiana leaves upon coexpression of HopM1
and the autophagy reporter constructs revealed a significant
decrease in the RLUC-ATG8a/FLUC ratio, indicating increased
autophagy activity (Figure 4A). In contrast, the T3Es HopX1 and
Hopl1, capable of suppressing SA-mediated defenses (Jelenska
et al., 2007; Gimenez-Ibanez et al., 2014) but not proteasome
activity (Üstün et al., 2016), did not alter the RLUC-ATG8a/
FLUC ratio (Figure 4B). Expression of all T3Es used in the quan-
titative autophagy assay was verified by immunoblot analysis
(Supplemental Figure 5). This finding indicated that the modulation
of autophagy is not a general feature of T3E interfering with SA
signaling.
To verify the effect of HopM1 on autophagy levels, we used
a dexamethasone-inducible HopM1-GFP transgenic Arabidopsis
line (Nomura et al., 2006, 2011). HopM1 expression resulted in
decreased NBR1 protein accumulation at steady state (Figure 4C)
that could be reverted to control level in the presence of ConA,
thus confirming enhanced autophagy flux (Figure 4D). To verify
that HopM1 also activates autophagic degradation in the infection
context, we took advantage of a Pst strain that lacks 28 T3Es (Pst
D28E) and can be engineered for delivery of single effectors
(Cunnac et al., 2011). Pst D28E containing HopM1 increased
the formation of GFP-ATG8a-labeled autophagosomal structures
to a similar extent as the wild-type Pst strain in comparison to
PstDhrcC, PstDhopM1, PstD28E, and mock controls (Figure 4E;
Supplemental Figure 6). The dramatic rise in GFP-ATG8a puncta
upon ConA treatment of HopM1-delivering PstD28E strongly
substantiates the finding that HopM1 activates autophagic
flux and suggests that this T3E is the major contributor to the
autophagy-inducing capacity of Pst.
Pst Induces Proteaphagy during Infection
Autophagy has recently been shown to mediate the turnover of
proteasomesduringnutrientstarvationandinresponsetochemicalor
genetic proteasome inhibition (Marshall et al., 2015). Since Pst sup-
presses proteasome activity and activates autophagy in Arabidopsis,
we analyzed whether proteaphagy is induced during bacterial in-
fection. Similar to treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132
(Gladman et al., 2016), Pst infection led to transcriptional upregulation
of proteasome subunits at 8 and 24 hpi (Figure 5A; Supplemental
672
The Plant Cell
 Figure 7). Transcript levels of PBA1, RPT2a, and the proteaphagy
receptor RPN10 were significantly increased, while expression of
RPT2b, which is nonresponsive to proteasome inhibition (Gladman
et al., 2016), remained unaltered during Pst infection (Figure 5A).
Consistent with the transcriptional response, levels of Arabidopsis
proteasome subunitswerealsoelevatedin Col-0 uponchallengewith
Pst (Figure 5B), but not with PstDhrcC (Supplemental Figure 8),
substantiating the T3E dependency of the phenotype. Notably, ConA
treatmentfurtherincreasedPBA1levelsuponinfectioncomparedwith
mock control (Figure 5C), indicating that the transcriptional upregu-
lation of proteasome subunits masks their autophagic degradation
both in response to Pst infection and chemical proteasome inhibition

Autophagy in Plant-Bacteria Interaction

 (Marshall et al., 2015). Together, these results reveal that Pst activates
proteaphagy to degrade proteasomes.
To test whether Pst-induced reduction of proteasome activity
results in autophagic clearance of proteasomes, we applied
a cell biological approach in the N. benthamiana system to
demonstrate the association of the proteasome with autophagy
proteins during infection. For this purpose, we transiently ex-
pressed the GFP-tagged proteasome core particle subunit
PAG1, which has previously been verified as a reliable protea-
some reporter (Marshall et al., 2015). Subsequently, leaves were
infected with a T3E HopQ1-1-deficient Pst strain (DhopQ1-1)
that is fully virulent in N. benthamiana and also capable of in-
hibiting proteasome activity (Cunnac et al., 2011; Misas-Villamil
et al., 2017). PstDhopQ1-1 induced the formation of PAG1-GFP
puncta and aggregates (Figures 5D and 5E) in a manner com-
parable to MG132 treatment (Supplemental Figure 9). Pst-in-
duced aggregation of PAG1 also proved to be dependent on T3E
secretion, as it was not observed upon infection with PstDhrcC
(Supplemental Figure 9), in agreement with the gene expression
response of proteasome subunits at transcript and protein level.
Importantly, we found colocalization of PAG1-GFP with RFP-
ATG8a, RFP-NBR1, RFP-Ubiquitin (Figure 5F), and RFP-tagged
ATG8e and ATG8g isoforms (Supplemental Figure 10). These
results suggest that the Pst-induced degradation of protea-
somes is linked to the autophagy pathway.
Finally, we tested whether loss of the proteaphagy receptor
RPN10 impacts Pst-induced proteasome malfunction in Arabi-
dopsis. Similar to other autophagy mutants, proteasome sup-
pression by Pst was abolished in the weak rpn10-1 mutant allele
(Smalle et al., 2003) that lacks the ubiquitin-interacting motifs
required for binding of ubiquitylated proteasomes and ATG8
(Supplemental Figure 11A). Bacterial growth was elevated in
rpn10-1 (Supplemental Figure 11B) similar to other proteasome
subunit mutants compared with the wild type (Figure 1B; Üstün
et al., 2016), suggesting that the function of RPN10 in pro-
teaphagy is masked by additional pleiotropic functions as
ubiquitin receptor in targeting substrates to the proteasome
(Smalle et al., 2003).
HopM1 Induces Proteaphagy
As HopM1 contributes to both proteasome suppression (Üstün
et al., 2016) and autophagy induction (Figure 4), we then tested
whether the T3E-dependent activation of proteaphagy involves
HopM1.BothtransientexpressionofHopM1viaagroinfiltrationas

 Figure 12). In addition, we found that the protein abundance of
PAG1-GFP was diminished in the presence HopM1 (Figure 6C).
ConA treatment reverted this HopM1-induced effect but also
stabilized PAG1-GFP at control conditions. These results sug-
gest that proteasomes are turned over by autophagy at basal
levels and that proteaphagy is further stimulated in response to
HopM1 activity. Confocal microscopy verified colocalization of
transiently expressed HopM1 with PAG1-GFP aggregates (Figure
6D) as well as association with the autophagy markers ATG8a
and NBR1 (Figure 6E). Furthermore, HopM1-induced PAG1-
GFP aggregates and punctuate structures colocalize with NBR1
and ATG8e (Supplemental Figure 13). These observations link
HopM1 to the proteasome and autophagy machinery, further
supporting HopM1-induced activation of proteaphagy. From
these data we conclude that Pst reduces proteasome activity
andtriggersproteaphagyvia the activityofthe T3EHopM1, thereby
impairing proteasome function.
NBR1 Counteracts HopM1-Triggered Water-Soaked
Lesions and Bacterial Pathogenicity
Based on our initial observation that Pst infection causes en-
hanced NBR1 flux and association of NBR1 with aggregated
proteasomesandHopM1,wewonderedwhetherNBR1-mediated
selective autophagy influences host immunity and bacterial
pathogenesis. The induction of NBR1-dependent selective pro-
cessesbyPstwasfurtheranalyzedusingatransgenicArabidopsis
line expressing GFP-NBR1. Compared with the noninfected
control, GFP-NBR1-labeled punctate structures were more
abundant upon infection and increased substantially upon
ConA treatment (Figures 7A and 7B). Additionally, NBR1 was
found in immunoprecipitates of GFP-ATG8a but not of free GFP
from Pst-infected plants (Supplemental Figure 14), further
supporting the notion that NBR1-mediated selective autophagy
is activated upon Pst challenge. To assess the biological rele-
vance of NBR1-dependent processes during infection, we
determined the Pst resistance response in Arabidopsis upon
loss of NBR1 function. Intriguingly, nbr1-2 plants supported
significantly more bacterial growth and displayed more pro-
nounced disease progression and water-soaked lesions com-
pared with wild-type plants (Figures 7C and 7D).
Recent data have shown that water-soaking is mediated by
HopM1andplaysanactiveroleinestablishinganaqueousapoplast
for bacterial pathogenesis (Xin et al., 2016). We therefore tested
whether NBR1-mediated autophagy antagonizes HopM1-induced
water-soakinginN.benthamianaleaves.Indeed, transientexpression
of NBR1 reduced the appearance of HopM1-triggered water-soaked
lesions and the extent of electrolyte leakage from leaf tissue, which
was dependent on the ATG8/LC3-interacting motif (AIM/LIR) and
main ubiquitin binding domain (UBA2) of NBR1 (Figures 7E and 7F).
The observed phenotypes were not due to lower HopM1 protein
levels, as HopM1 abundance remained largely unchanged upon
coexpression of wild-type and mutant forms of NBR1 (Supplemental
Figure 15).
Based on these data, we speculate that NBR1 is involved in the
autophagic degradation of an as yet unknown factor required for
HopM1-induced water-soaking. In agreement with this notion,
nbr1-2 mutants hyperaccumulate ubiquitinated proteins to
higher levels than in Col-0 upon Pst infection (Supplemental
Figure 16), suggesting that NBR1 might contribute to the turn-
over of ubiquitinated substrates during infection.
Together, these findings reveal that NBR1-mediated selec-
tive autophagy plays a role in antibacterial immunity and thus
acts contrary to NBR1-independent proteaphagy in bacterial
pathogenesis.
DISCUSSION
Autophagy is well recognized as an intrinsic pathway with both
anti- and promicrobial functions during viral and bacterial
infections in animals (Levine et al., 2011; Mostowy, 2013; Paul
and Münz, 2016). Recent evidence indicates that xenophagic
mechanisms also target viruses and their components in plants
and that some viruses evolved sophisticated strategies to es-
cape or hijack autophagy processes for enhanced pathogenicity
(Derrien et al., 2012; Hafrén et al., 2017, 2018; Haxim et al., 2017).
Plant pathogenic bacteria differ from their animal counterparts
and viral pathogens in the exclusive extracellular proliferation,
but they exhibit a similar capacity to manipulate the intracellular
machineryviasecretedeffectorproteins.Whileautophagyiswell
known to contribute to the effector-triggered hypersensitive
response upon avirulent P. syringae infection (Hofius et al., 2009;
Kwon et al., 2013; Coll et al., 2014), the role of autophagic
processes during virulent bacterial infections has remained to be
clarified.
In this study, we demonstrate that Pst delivers the T3E HopM1
to enhance autophagic flux and activate proteaphagy, thus leading
to the suppression of proteasome function and promotion of vir-
ulence.Bycontrast,theselectivecargoreceptorNBR1counteracts
HopM1-induced water-soaking and suppresses bacterial pro-
liferation. Hence, our data establish the phytopathogenic bac-
terium P. syringae as a seminal example of the integration of

 distinct autophagy pathways into host immunity and bacterial
pathogenesis. In addition, we provide evidence for the intimate
crosstalk between autophagy and the proteasome during plant-
pathogen interactions.
Probacterial Role of Autophagy during P. syringae Infection
Several pathogenic bacteria in animals inhibit autophagy to es-
cape their elimination by xenophagy (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella,
Legionella, and Mycobacterium) (Shpilka and Elazar, 2012; Mostowy,
2013), whereas others seem to exploit autophagy components
and structures to promote their replication and survival (e.g.,
Listeria, Staphylococcus, and Brucella) (Mostowy, 2013). Our
findings clearly support a probacterial function of T3E-triggered
autophagy during virulent P. syringae infection in plants. In particular,
the significant promotion of bacterial growth upon autophagy en-
hancement by AZD8055 treatment or ATG5 overexpression is in
accordance with previous observations that transgenic plants ex-
pressing a constitutively active form of the positive autophagy reg-
ulator RabG3B are more susceptible (Kwon et al., 2013), and
autophagy-deficient mutants more resistant (Lenz et al. 2011) to
Pst infection.
Our data provide several lines of evidence for a novel mech-
anistic link between Pst-induced probacterial autophagy and
inactivationof proteasomefunction:(1)Autophagy-defectiveatg
mutants are insensitive to Pst-induced proteasome inhibition,
which is not caused by altered SA levels and signaling; (2) en-
hanced bacterial resistance in atg mutants is abolished by
mutations in proteasome subunits; and (3) proteaphagy is in-
duced by the autophagy-stimulating T3E HopM1. Because
proteaphagy is activated upon chemical proteasome inhibition
(Marshall et al., 2015), and some effectors from Xanthomonas
ssp and P. syringae pv lachrymans interact directly with the
proteasome to block its activity (Üstün et al., 2013, 2014; Üstün
and Börnke, 2015), we anticipate that HopM1-mediated in-
terference with the proteasome leads to proteaphagy activation
and suppression of proteasome function during Pst infection.
In support of this model (illustrated in Figure 8), HopM1 was
previouslyshowntoinhibitproteasomeactivityandassociatewith
proteasome subunits(Üstünetal.,2016).Inaddition, thepresence
of the unprocessed form ofPBA1 in the atg5background upon Pst
infection confirms direct effector targeting of the proteasome
independent of autophagy activation. We also observed several
hallmarks of chemical proteasome inhibition during bacterial in-
fection (Marshall et al., 2015), including increased transcript and
protein levels of multiple proteasome subunits as well as pro-
teasome aggregation. However, in contrast to Pst infection,
MG132 treatment is still sufficient to inactivate the proteasome in
atg mutants (Marshall et al., 2016), suggesting different modes of
HopM1 and MG132 action. Indeed, HopM1 is mainly associated
with the regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome (Üstün et al.,
2016), while MG132 targets its catalytic subunits (Bibo-Verdugo
et al., 2017). Hence, anefficientblock ofproteasome activity during
Pst infection requires a functional proteaphagy pathway involving
the core autophagy machinery (ATG2, ATG5, and ATG7) and cargo
receptor (RPN10). Intriguingly, proteasome activity appeared
rather elevated in the atg mutants. This observation might give
at least an indirect explanation why autophagy-deficient mu-
tants are more resistant to Pst infection (Lenz et al., 2011).
Enhanced proteasome activity was demonstrated to correlate
with activated PAMP-triggered immune responses and re-
sistance toward nonpathogenic bacteria (Üstün et al., 2016).
The strong overall increase in cellular autophagy levels upon
Pst infection and HopM1 delivery in Arabidopsis still implies
the possibility that HopM1 and potentially additional T3Es
stimulate bulk and selective autophagy pathways by other as
yet unknown mechanisms. Notably, HopM1 has been localized
to the trans-Golgi network/early endosomes (TGN/EEs) where
it exerts virulence function (Nomura et al., 2006). In general,
there is substantial evidence for the extensive overlap and
crosstalk between autophagy and endosomal trafficking
pathways in eukaryotes including plants (Teh and Hofius,
2014; Kalinowska and Isono, 2017; Noda, 2017) and the TGN/
EE has recently been implicated in the regulation of auto-
phagosome formation in mammalian cells (Guo et al., 2012;
Mattera et al., 2017). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that
HopM1 might target host proteins and associated processes
at the TGN, resulting in autophagy induction or promotion.
Such primarily enhanced autophagic activities may result in
concurrent turnover of proteasomes, resembling the situation
of starvation-induced proteaphagy (Marshall et al., 2015).
Which host targets are mainly responsible for the effector-
triggered autophagy enhancement and proteaphagy induction
will be an important subject of future research.
Besides selective proteaphagy to suppress proteasome-
dependent host defense, the stimulation of bulk autophagy may

 have additional benefits for the hemibiotrophic bacterium. One
possibility is related to the survival function of autophagy in
suppressing stress- and disease-associated cell death (Üstün
et al., 2017). Increased plant viability and life span by autophagy
activation has been demonstrated to serve the production of
CaMV particlesand, thus, potential vector transmission (Hafrén
et al., 2017). Hence, Pst-induced autophagy may prolong the
biotrophic phase during infection, thereby supporting bacterial
survival and proliferation. Alternatively, effector-triggered auto-
phagy might also be involved in the recycling and rerouting of
nutrients in favor of the pathogen during the establishment of
infection or upon transition from the biotrophic to necrotrophic

Ralstonia solanacearum (Popa et al., 2016) and the oomycete
Phytophthora infestans (Dagdas et al., 2016).
Antibacterial Role of Autophagy during P. syringae Infection
While bulk autophagy and proteaphagy contribute to bacterial
pathogenicity, NBR1-dependent selective autophagy seems to
restrict bacterial infection. NBR1 proteins in plants are structurally
and functionally related to the mammalian autophagic cargo
receptors NBR1 and p62/sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1) that either
act alone or cooperate in targeting mostly ubiquitinated sub-
strates to the growing phagophore (Svenning et al., 2011). Unlike
NBR1 homologs, p62 proteins are confined to metaozans, but
Arabidopsis NBR1 and the N. benthamiana homolog Joka2 share
their ability of self-oligomerization and aggregation (Svenning
et al., 2011; Zientara-Rytter and Sirko, 2014). Thus, plant NBR1
proteins are regarded as functional hybrids of mammalian NBR1
and p62 and have been assigned a general role in targeting
polyubiquitinated protein aggregates for autophagic degrada-
tion, e.g., in abiotic stress conditions (Svenning et al., 2011;
Zhou et al., 2013). Recently, NBR1-mediated xenophagy of
nonassembled viral capsid protein and particles has been linked
to antiviral immunity against CaMV infection (Hafrén et al., 2017).
Intriguingly, the RXLR effector PexRD54 counteracts the func-
tion of Joka2 in host defense during P. infestans infection of
N. benthamiana (Dagdas et al., 2016). A model was proposed in
which Joka2 facilitates the removal of plant or pathogen proteins
negativelyregulatingimmunity.PexRD54might hijackthispathway
to selectively eliminate defense compounds or to reallocate
nutrients to the infection structures (i.e., haustoria) (Dagdas
et al., 2016). Our finding of NBR1-mediated suppression of
HopM1-induced water-soaking together with the enhanced
susceptibility of nbr1-2 mutants to Pst infection supports the
conserved integration of NBR1-dependent processes in plant
immunity against different pathogens with a (hemi)-biotrophic
lifestyle. Bacterial infection increases the amount of ubiquiti-
nated proteins due to the reduction of proteasome activity
(Üstün et al., 2016) and autophagy activation. The increased
abundance of polyubiquitinated proteins in nbr1-2 plants in
response to Pst infection indicates that NBR1 contributes to the
turnover of these proteins, which is possibly required for acti-
vation, or maintenance, of antibacterial defenses. Given that
transient overexpression of NBR1 reduces the establishment of
water-soaked lesion, we speculate that NBR1 is involved in the
selective degradation of negative immune regulators and/or
substrates required for HopM1-triggered water-soaking. Al-
though we find partial association of HopM1-labeled structures
with NBR1 and ATG8, there is currently no substantial evidence
suggesting that NBR1-mediated selective autophagy may be
involved in the direct targeting of bacterial effectors. However,
similar to P. infestans, distinct effectors and NBR1 may coincide
at the same cellular destinations due to their competition in mod-
ulating similar host targets and processes.
Inconclusion,weproposethatPsthasevolvedaneffector-based

growth assays, bacterial suspensions with an OD600 of 0.0001 were
syringe-infiltrated into three fully expanded leaves per soil-grown plant. At
3 d postinoculation, leaf discs from infiltrated leaf areas were homogenized
using two technical replicates (leaf discs from the same plant) each from
four independent plants, and leaf extracts were plated in appropriate di-
lutions on solid King’s B medium. Colony-forming units were determined
after plate incubation for 1 to 2 d at 28°C. Bacterial infections in seedlings
were performed as described (Ishiga et al., 2011) with slight modifications.
In brief, 10- to 14-d-old seedlings were flood-inoculated for 3 min with
a bacterial suspension at an OD600 of 0.1 containing 0.025% Silwet L-77.
For NBR1 flux assays and immunoblot analysis, seedlings were harvested
10 h after inoculation. Bacterial infections for RT-qPCR analysis, protea-
some activity measurements, confocal microscopy, and immunoblot anal-
ysis were performed with a bacterial suspension at an OD600 of between
0.1 and 0.2 to provide fast and robust responses.
Plasmid Construction
For transient expression experiments, the coding region of the protea-
some subunit PAG1 was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO and subsequently
recombined into pGWB505 (Nakagawa et al., 2007), while the coding
region of ubiquitin (UBQ11) was similarly cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO
and then recombined into pUBN-DEST-RFP (Grefen et al., 2010). The
RFP-ATG8a, RFP-NBR1, HopM1-HA, and HopI1-HA constructs were
described previously (Hafrén et al., 2017; Üstün et al., 2016). All binary
plasmids were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1
and infiltration of N. benthamiana was done at the four- to six-leaf stage. For
the quantitative autophagy assay, the coding sequences of the luciferases
from Photinus pyralis (Firefly luciferase [FLUC]) and Renilla reniformis
(Renilla luciferase [RLUC]) were amplified from the pRD400-35S:FLUC and
pRD400-35S:RLUC vectors (Eskelin et al., 2011) using FLUC_fwd/FLUC_rev
and RLUC_fwd/RLUC_rev as primer pairs, respectively (Supplemental Table
1). The FLUC sequence was then introduced into pMDC32 (Curtis and
Grossniklaus, 2003) between the double 35S promoter and the Gateway
cassette using KpnI/AscI restriction sites resulting in the pMDC32:FLUC
vector. To produce a pMDC32 vector with kanamycin resistance for
expression of RLUC, the hygromycin B resistance gene of pMDC32 was
replaced by the NPTII gene. RLUC was then introduced between the
double 35S promoter and the Gateway cassette of the modified pMDC32
vector using the same KpnI/AscI restriction sites.
Transient Expression in N. benthamiana by Agrobacterium-
Mediated Leaf Infiltration
Agrobacterium strains harboring the indicated plasmids were grown
overnight in liquid LB media at 28°C with appropriate antibiotics and
harvested by centrifugation at 3000g for 5 min. Bacterial pellets were
washed once in double-distilled water, resuspended in infiltration buffer
(10 mM MES, pH 5.7, 10 mM MgCl2, and 150 mM acetosyringone), and
incubated for 2 h at room temperature without shaking. The OD600 of each
culture was adjusted such that approximately equal numbers of bacteria
from cultures expressing different transgenes were mixed and infiltrated
into N. benthamiana leaves using a needleless syringe.

Live-cell images were acquired from abaxial leaf epidermal cells using
aZeissLSM780microscope.Excitation/detectionparametersforGFPand
RFP were 488 nm/490 to 552 nm and 561 nm/569 to 652 nm, respectively,
and sequential scanning mode was used for colocalization of both fluo-
rophores. Inhibitor treatment was performed by either syringe infiltration of
mature leaves or incubation of seedlings in half-strength MS with 0.5 mM
ConA for 6 or 14 h prior to confocal analysis. Confocal images were
processed with ZEN (version 2011) and ImageJ (version 1.48v) software.
Quantification of GFP-ATG8a-labeled autophagosomal structures was
done on single planes that were converted to eight-bit grayscale and then
counted for GFP-ATG8 puncta either manually or by the Particle Analyzer
function of ImageJ.
Immunoprecipitation
GFP pull-down assays were performed as previously described (Dagdas
et al., 2016) with minor modifications. Approximately 2.5 g of Arabidopsis
leaf material was ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and homog-
enized in 5 mL of extraction buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
10% glycerol, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 2% [w/v] polyvinylpolypyrrolidone,
1% [v/v] protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma], and 0.1% [v/v] Nonidet P-40).
Insoluble debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min with 2000g at
4°C. Immunoprecipitation was performed by adding 30 mL of GFP-Trap
coupled to agarose beads (ChromoTek) and samples were incubated for
2 h at 4°C with continual rotation. Beads were subsequently washed five
times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and
immunoprecipitates were eluted with 30 mL of 23 SDS loading buffer at
70°C for 10 min.
Immunoblot Analysis
Proteins were extracted in 100 mM Tris (pH 7.5) containing 2% SDS, boiled
for 10 min in SDS loading buffer, and cleared by centrifugation. The protein
extracts were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF mem-
branes (Amersham, GE Healthcare), blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS,
and incubated with primary antibodies anti-NBR1 (Svenning et al., 2011),
anti-ATG8a (Yoshimoto et al., 2004), anti-ubiquitin (Agrisera), anti-GFP
(Clontech and Santa Cruz), anti-PBA1 (Enzo Life Science), anti-RPT2a (Enzo
Autophagy in Plant-Bacteria Interaction
681
 Life Science), and anti-RPN10 (Lin et al., 2011) primary antibodies using
1:2000 dilutions in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. This was followed by
incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
diluted 1:10,000 in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The immunoreaction
was developed using an ECL Prime Kit (GE Healthcare) and detected with
a LAS-3000 Luminescent Image Analyzer (Fujifilm).
RT-qPCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen), and
on-column DNA digestion was performed with DNase I (Qiagen). First-
strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg of total RNA using the Maxima
First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantitative
PCR analysis was done with Maxima SYBR Green/Fluorescein qPCR
Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the CFX Connect Real-
Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) with the gene-specific primers
listed in Supplemental Table 1. Normalization was done using PP2A
(AT1G69960).
Proteasome Activity Measurement
Proteasome activity was determined as described previously (Üstün et al.,
2016; Üstün and Börnke, 2017).
Dual Luciferase Assay
The dual luciferase reporter assay was performed according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System; Promega)
with slight modifications. Briefly,four leaf discs werehomogenized in200 mL
lysis buffer and cleared by centrifugation. For detection and measurement of
theFireflyluciferaseactivity,40mLoftheluciferaseassayreagentwasadded
to 5 mL of plant extracts. To measure Renilla luciferase activity, 40 mL of
the Stop and Glo reagent was added to the mixture. The measurement
was performed in a plate reader.
Ion Leakage Measurement
For quantification of water-soaking in HopM1-expressing N. benthamiana
leaves, electrolyte leakage assays were done essentially as described
(Üstün et al., 2012). In brief, four leaf discs (0.9 cm in diameter) per bi-
ological replicate were sampled at 48 h post-agroinfiltration, placed into
a reaction tube with 8 mL double-distilled water, and incubated overnight
at 4°C under constant rotation. Conductivity of the bath solution was
measured with a conductometer (EcoScan Hand-held Series; Eutech
Instruments), and values were expressed as the percentage of maximum
values obtained by subsequent boiling of the samples for 30 min.
Data Analysis and Presentation
Data are presented as mean 6 SD. Statistical significance was analyzed by
Student’s t test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and P*** < 0.001) or one-way ANOVA
(P < 0.05). The number of biological replicates (n) is given in the figure
legends.
