Abstract
Swine production work is a risk factor for nasal carriage of livestock-associated (LA-)
Staphylococcus aureus and also for skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). However, whether
LA-S. aureus nasal carriage is associated with increased risk of SSTI remains unclear. We
aimed to examine S. aureus nasal carriage and recent (�3 months prior to enrollment)
SSTI symptoms among industrial hog operation (IHO) workers and their household con-
tacts. IHO workers and their household contacts provided a nasal swab and responded to a
questionnaire assessing self-reported personal and occupational exposures and recent
SSTI symptoms. Nasal swabs were analyzed for S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant
S. aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant-S. aureus (MDRSA), absence of scn (livestock
association), and spa type. S. aureus with at least one indicator of LA was observed among
19% of 103 IHO workers and 6% of 80 household members. Prevalence of recent SSTI
was 6% among IHO workers and 11% among 54 minor household members (0/26 adult
household members reported SSTI). Among IHO workers, nasal carriers of MDRSA and
scn-negative S. aureus were 8.8 (95% CI: 1.8, 43.9) and 5.1 (95% CI: 1.2, 22.2) times as
likely to report recent SSTI as non-carriers, respectively. In one household, both an IHO
worker and child reported recent SSTI and carried the same S. aureus spa type (t4976)
intranasally. Prevalence of scn-negative S. aureus (PR: 5.0, 95% CI: 1.2, 21.4) was ele-
vated among IHO workers who reported never versus always wearing a face mask at work.

 Although few SSTI were reported, this study of IHO workers and their household contacts
is the first to characterize a relation between nasal carriage of antibiotic-resistant LA-S.
aureus and SSTI. The direction and temporality of this relation and IHO workers’ use of
face masks to prevent nasal carriage of these bacteria warrant further investigation.
Introduction
Over the past decade, animal-adapted strains of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have
emerged globally among food-producing animals, as well as among people who have contact
with food-producing animals [1]. These S. aureus, which include methicillin-resistant (MRSA)
and multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MDRSA) strains, are commonly referred to as livestock-
associated (LA-) S. aureus. LA-S. aureus may spread from animals to humans through direct
contact and through contact with animal dander, particles from decomposing waste [2], and
aerosols generated by animal activity (e.g. movement, coughing, and/or sneezing) [3]. Clonal
complex (CC) 398 is the most widely describedstrain, although CC9 is increasingly reported in
Asia [4,5] and the United States [6,7]. Nasal carriage and infection with LA-S. aureus has
increased among individuals without livestock exposure in several European Union countries,
suggesting that human-to-human transmission may now be occurringin the community,
albeit at a lower rate than typical community-associated S. aureus CCs [8–10].
Despite high prevalence of LA-S. aureus nasal carriage among individuals occupationally-
exposed to livestock [1] and increasing prevalence among some non-exposed populations
[8,11], it remains unclear whether LA-S. aureus nasal carriage is a risk factor for skin and soft
tissue infection (SSTI). Nasal carriage of hospital and community-associated S. aureus, which
occurs among 20–40% of the general United States population, is an established risk factor for
infection in the clinical setting [12]. However, LA-S. aureus appear to differ from hospital and
community-associated strains in that they typically lack genetic factors associated with human
infection, including Panton-Valentine leukocidin- (PVL-) encoding genes, enterotoxin-pro-
ducing genes, and human immune evasion complex (e.g., scn) genes [13–15]. Their capacity
for human-to-human transmission also appears to be lower than many widespread commu-
nity- and hospital-associated S. aureus CCs [16,17]. Most LA-S. aureus infections present as
SSTI, which are of concern to IHO workers who can experience lacerations, abrasions, and
other skin injuries through their daily work activities [18,19]. Associations between LA-S.
aureus nasal carriage and SSTI are difficultto investigate through studies in clinical settings
because many livestock workers lack regular access to medical care [20], and because nasal
screening for S. aureus is not typically conducted for clinical SSTI cases [21,22]. To date, pro-
spective cohort studies of healthy volunteer hog production workers have not identified risk
factors for SSTI other than livestock exposure [21,23,24]. Identifying an association between
SSTI and nasal carriage, which can be managed through decolonization interventions [25],
could help efforts to prevent S. aureus exposure and associated infections among livestock
workers and their household and community contacts.
In the present study, we assessed nasal carriage of LA-S. aureus among industrial hog opera-
tion (IHO) workers and their household members in North Carolina and estimated associations
with self-reported SSTI symptoms. Using data from the baseline enrollment visit of a four-
month repeated-measures study of S. aureus nasal carriage, we examined: (a) baseline prevalence
and distribution of S. aureus nasal carriage patterns; (b) associations between S. aureus nasal car-
riage patterns and reports of recent (in the three months prior to the baseline visit) SSTI symp-
toms; and (c) associations between S. aureus nasal carriage patterns and IHO work exposures.

 Materials and Methods
Data Collection
Data were collected between October 2013 and February 2014 by community organizers from
the Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help (REACH) with researchers from
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) and the Gillings School of
Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Community
organizers recruited volunteer livestock workers who fit the following inclusion criteria: cur-
rently worked at an industrial hog operation (IHO), resided in North Carolina, could speak
English or Spanish, and were at least 18 years of age. Only individuals employed in production
of live pigs were considered IHO workers for the purposes of this study; individuals employed
in other types of food animal production or meat processing (e.g. slaughterhouses, processing
plants, rendering facilities) were not included in the study. Up to three individuals living in the
same household as an IHO worker were eligible to participate if they were at least seven years
old and spoke English or Spanish. Because enrolled participants were encouraged to refer IHO
workers in their social networks to participate, it was not possible to determine the total num-
ber of IHO workers who learned about this study, or the percent who were not interested in
contacting community organizers for further information about participating. Before partici-
pating, adults provided written informed consent. Written parental permission and informed
assent were collected for participants seven to 17 years of age (hereafter referred to as
“minors”). The JHSPH Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved this study (IRB00004608).
The UNC Non-Biomedical IRB approved reliance on the JHSPH IRB.
Each participant attended a baseline enrollment session at the REACH office or in a com-
munity meeting space (e.g. a local church). Each enrollment session lasted between 2–3 hours.
Participants responded to a baseline questionnaire which assessed demographic information,
household characteristics, work activities, risk factors for exposure to S. aureus, and symptoms
of SSTI and doctor-diagnosedS. aureus infection during the three months prior to the enroll-
ment session. Participants also provided a self-collectedBBL CultureSwab (BD, Sparks, MD)
from both of their anterior nares, under supervision and using illustrated diagrams and verbal
instruction. Nasal swabs were self-collectedrather than collected by investigators based on
prior experience in a repeated-measures S. aureus nasal carriage study in which participants
demonstrated consistent and repeatable nasal swabbing technique [6]. Self-collectednasal
swabs can be as effective in recovering pathogens from the anterior nares as investigator-col-
lected swabs in a supervisedsetting [6,26–28]. Participants were provided with a monetary
incentive after completing study tasks (approved by the JHSPH IRB).
Detection of S. aureus and MRSA
Baseline swabs were transported to UNC at 4°C within 12 hours of collection. A trip blank was
included with each shipment to confirm lack of contamination during transport. Within three
days of arrival, each swab was clipped into one ml of phosphate-buffered saline and vortexed
for 60 seconds. One hundred μL of this eluate was plate spread on CHROMagar™ Staph aureus
(BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) (CSA) while the remaining eluate and swab were refrigerated at 4°C.
After incubation at 37°C for 24 hours, at least two colonies with morphology characteristic of
S. aureus were streaked on quadrants of a new CSA plate. If direct plating did not yield colonies
with S. aureus morphology, swabs and remaining PBS were enriched overnight at 37°C in 10
mL Mueller-Hinton broth containing 6.5% NaCl. A loopful (~10 μL) of Mueller-Hinton broth
was streaked onto both Baird Parker and CSA plates to increase sensitivity of detection [29],
and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Up to two colonies with morphology characteristic of S.

 aureus on either media were then streaked on quadrants of a new CSA plate. In total, presump-
tive S. aureus colonies were isolated within two to four days of nasal swab collection. Presump-
tive colonies were archived at -80°C in brain heart infusion broth with 15% (w/v) glycerol.
A crude DNA extraction was performed on each isolate using a protocol adapted from
Reischl et al. [30]. Multiplex PCR was used to amplify the spa, scn, mecA, and mecC genes [31].
Strain LGA251 was used as an extraction and PCR control for spa and mecC, while a clinical
MRSA isolate was used as an extraction and PCR control for spa, scn, and mecA. Sterile water
was used as a negative control. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels stained with
ethidium bromide. Colonies positive for spa, a S. aureus-specific gene, were classified as S.
aureus. Singleplex PCR was used to evaluate the presence of pvl-encoding genes among all S.
aureus isolates [32].
All isolates were characterized by spa typing using the Ridom StaphType software and the
Ridom SpaServer(http://spa.ridom.de/index.shtml) [33]. S. aureus CCs, including CC398 and
CC9, are traditionally inferred through multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), which we did not
perform. However, spa types associated with CC398 and CC9 have been describedby other
studies in which both MLST and spa typing were performed [15,34,35]. Thus, we assigned
putative CC398 or CC9 to isolates in this study based on spa type, the literature, and the Ridom
SpaServer, as others have done [6,36].
Assessment of antibiotic susceptibility
One isolate from each S. aureus-positive nasal swab was assessed for susceptibility to a panel of
antibiotics (S1 Table), using the Phoenix Automated Microbiology System (BD Diagnostic Sys-
tems, Sparks, MD). Testing was completed by the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at the
Johns Hopkins Hospital. Isolates for testing were shipped from UNC to JHU between January
and February, 2014. MRSA were defined as S. aureus isolates resistant to cefoxitin and positive
for either mecA or mecC [37]. MDRSA were defined as S. aureus isolates resistant to three or
more classes of antibiotics. MRSA isolates meeting the definition of MDRSA were classified as
multidrug-resistant MRSA. However, MRSA and MDRSA did not necessarily overlap by these
definitions.
Indicators of livestock association
There is currently no consensus marker for LA-S. aureus. We examined four indicators of live-
stock association among S. aureus isolates: strain type CC398, strain type CC9, absence of scn,
and tetracycline resistance. We have used CC398, absence of scn, and tetracycline resistance as
indicators of livestock association in previous work [6,38]. CC9 has been identified as a marker
of LA-S. aureus among livestock workers in Asia [39], and has been observedamong livestock
herds and people in contact with these herds in the Midwestern US [7], and in the same geo-
graphic region as the present study [6,38].
Definition of recent SSTI outcome
We created the main infection outcome variable, “any symptoms of S. aureus SSTI in the past
three months,” as “Yes”
, “No”
, or “missing” based on participants’ responses to the baseline ques-
tionnaire. This variable was coded “Yes” for participants who reported “Yes, in the past three
months” to any of the following: doctor-diagnosedS. aureus infection; skin boil; pus-filled
abscess; red, painful, swollen skin bump or pimple; or spider bite that was itchy and oozes liquid;
“No” for participants who reported “No” to all of the above; or as “Missing.” Prior to responding,
participants were shown pictures of S. aureus SSTI with each of these manifestations (courtesy of

 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] and Dr. Tara Smith, Kent State Univer-
sity). Hereafter, we refer to this outcome as “recent SSTI.”
Statistical analysis
We compared the distributions of potential individual (e.g. use of antibiotics, participation in
contact sports) and household risk factors (e.g. number of household members, pets, home
located on a hog operation) for S. aureus nasal carriage between workers and household mem-
bers. For analyses in which prevalence of S. aureus nasal carriage was evaluated as an outcome,
results for adult and minor household members were combined for sample size considerations.
We calculated the prevalence of nasal carriage of S. aureus, MRSA, and MDRSA among work-
ers and their household members, including livestock-associated classifications of the above.
We used log-binomial regression models to estimate crude prevalence ratios (PR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for associations between participant type (worker versus household
member) and S. aureus nasal carriage outcomes, S. aureus nasal carriage outcomes and recent
SSTI, and occupational exposures and S. aureus nasal carriage outcomes. We used generalized
estimating equations with an exchangeable correlation matrix to account for the non-indepen-
dence of observations within-household [40]. Individual and household-level risk factors that
were associated with both participant type and nasal carriage patterns were included in log
binomial regression models where sample size allowed. However, adjusted PRs are not pre-
sented because inclusion of these covariates did not change the magnitude or precision of effect
estimates. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC). An anonymized (de-identi-
fied) dataset has been included in the Supplemental Materials showing sufficient variables to
reproduce the analysis (S1 Appendix).
Results
Participant and household characteristics
One hundred eighty-three participants, comprising 103 workers (56%), 26 adult household
members (14%), and 54 minor children (30%) completed a baseline questionnaire and pro-
vided a baseline nasal swab (Table 1). All but two participants identified as Hispanic or Afri-
can-American. Traditional risk factors for nasal carriage of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus were
uncommon among IHO workers and adult household members (e.g. hospitalization, use of
antibiotics, use of a gym or workout facility, and/or playing contact sports within the past three
months; among adult household members, working in a medical facility was also uncommon).
Among minors, recently playing contact sports (36%) and using a gym or workout facility
(55%) were more common, but using antibiotics was uncommon (6%) (Table 1).
In total, the 183 participants comprised 81 households (S2 Table). Most households com-
prised three to five individuals (73%) and 45% reported having children under seven in the
home. Over half reported having no health insurance (58%). Care from a private doctor was
most common (44%) but 32% reported seeking care at an urgent care or emergency depart-
ment for medical care (S2 Table).
Prevalence of S. aureus, MRSA, and MDRSA
Forty-five of 103 workers (44%) and 31 of 80 household members (39%) carried S. aureus at
baseline and MRSA was observedin only one worker (Table 2). Twenty-one workers (20%) and
eight household members (10%) carried MDRSA (Table 2). S. aureus carried by IHO workers
exhibited a larger diversity of antibiotic resistance patterns (10 distinct patterns observed)than S.
aureus carried by their household members (five patterns observed)(S3 Table).

S. aureus (PR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 10.3) among workers compared to household members
(Table 2). Putative S. aureus CC9 was only observedamong workers (9/103) but putative S.
aureus CC398, including CC398 with additional indicators of livestock association, was
observedamong both workers and their household members (Table 2). We did not observe
pvl-encoding genes among any S. aureus isolates in this study.

 IHO workers with a swollen skin bump reported this symptom was a doctor-diagnosedS. aureus
infection. Six of 80 household members (8%) reported recent SSTI, and all of these household
members were minors (6/54; 11%) (Table 3). Three minors (10, 11, and 12 years old) reported a
swollen skin bump and two minors (7 and 8 years old) reported a spider bite that was itchy. One
minor reported a doctor-diagnosedS. aureus infection, but did not describeits presentation.
Among all participants, we observedthat those who carried S. aureus (PR: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4,
14.9) and MDRSA (PR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 7.8) (Table 3) intranasally were more likely to report
a recent SSTI. Among IHO workers, we observeda higher prevalence of recent SSTI among
individuals carrying versus not carrying MDRSA (PR: 8.8, 95% CI: 1.8, 43.9) and scn-negative
S. aureus (PR: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.2, 22.2); associations between recent SSTI and nasal carriage of
S. aureus and tetracycline-resistant S. aureus were positive but not statistically significant
(Table 3).

 Characteristics of S. aureus isolates recovered from the anterior nares of workers and minors
who reported recent SSTI are describedin Table 4. One IHO worker-minor pair in the same
household who reported recent SSTI were S. aureus nasal carriage positive and carried the
same S. aureus spa type (t4976), although the minor’s isolate was tetracycline-susceptible
(Table 4). One additional IHO worker-minor pair in the same household who reported a doc-
tor-diagnosed S. aureus infection were S. aureus-nasal carriage negative. None of the six IHO
workers who reported recent SSTI carried S. aureus CC398 but two carried scn-negative S.
aureus CC9, one carried scn-negative, tetracycline-resistant t002, and one carried tetracycline-
resistant t4976 (Table 4).
Occupational risk factors for nasal carriage
Among the 103 participating IHO workers, working between 51–60 hours per week was most
common (40/99) (S4 Table). Almost all workers (96%) reported always wearing boots or other
foot protection while at work, but always wearing gloves (86%), and always wearing long
sleeves and pants or coveralls (86%) were somewhat less common. Only 37% of IHO workers
reported always wearing a face mask at work. A higher nasal carriage prevalence of MDRSA
(PR: 3.9, 95% CI: 1.0, 15.2), scn-negative S. aureus (PR: 5.0, 95% CI: 1.2, 21.4), and tetracycline-
resistant S. aureus (PR: 4.1, 95% CI: 0.9, 17.7) was observedamong workers who reported

 never wearing a face mask versus those who reported always wearing a face mask at work
(Table 5). Examination of statistical associations between IHO workers’ occupational exposures
and recent SSTI was limited due to small numbers. But we did observeincreasing prevalence of
recent SSTI as IHO workers’ reported frequency of face mask usage decreased (S4 Table).
Discussion
In this study population of IHO workers and their household contacts, we found that nasal car-
riage of S. aureus was associated with recent symptoms of SSTI. Among IHO workers specifi-
cally, we observedpositive associations between nasal carriage of each S. aureus-related
outcome we examined (S. aureus, MDRSA, scn-negative S. aureus, tetracycline-resistant S.
aureus) and recent SSTI. Only associations with MDRSA and scn-negative S. aureus were sta-
tistically significant; however, the direction and similar magnitude of these associations indi-
cates that nasal carriage may be associated with SSTI outcomes in this study population.
Overall, the twelve participants who reported recent SSTI included two IHO worker-minor

 pairs; one of these worker-minor pairs reported that a doctor had confirmed their SSTI symp-
toms as a S. aureus infection. This is one of the first reports in the United States of an associa-
tion between nasal carriage of livestock-associated S. aureus and SSTI among individuals with
frequent and intensive exposure to industrial hog production, as well as of SSTI prevalence
among their minor child household members. This finding warrants further investigation to
assess the directionality of the relation between S. aureus nasal carriage and SSTI in this
population.
Few studies have surveyed SSTI among individuals employed in livestock production. In
this cross-sectional analysis, we observeda SSTI prevalence of 6.6% (12/183). A retrospective
analysis of reported injuries among pork meatpacking and poultry processing workers from
2004–2009 determined average annual SSTI prevalence to be 33% and 12%, respectively [41].
A cross-sectional online and paper-based survey of US pork producers identified a self-
reported MRSA infection prevalence of 5/135 (3.7%) [42]. In one other published study of
SSTI among hog farm owners and operators that we are aware of, Wardyn et al. observedan
incidence of 6.6 cases/1,000 person-months [7]. The present study differed from Wardyn et al.
in several ways. First, Wardyn et al. only examined farm owners and operators, for whom
exposure to animals and the confinement barn environment may be less intensive than for
hired laborers whose job tasks primarily involve direct contact with livestock. Second, partici-
pants in Wardyn et al.’s study were primarily Caucasian (98.9%), while participants in this
study were primarily Hispanic (89%). Hispanic livestock production workers are believed to
significantly underreport occupational injuries compared to Caucasian workers [43]. Third,
Wardyn et al. ascertained S. aureus infections using prospectively-collectedskin swabs, while
we only assessed SSTI through participants’ recall of recent symptoms. Participants’ recall of
SSTI symptoms may have included infections prior to the three months before enrollment,
skin afflictions that were not related to a bacterial infection, and/or SSTIs with a bacterial etiol-
ogy other than S. aureus. In order to minimize the possibility of reporting errors, we showed
participants pictures of S. aureus SSTI (provided by the CDC and Dr. Tara Smith, Kent State
University) prior to asking them to report SSTI symptoms. In our study, any potential misclas-
sification due to recall was non-differential with respect to S. aureus nasal carriage status since
participants were blinded to their lab result at enrollment. However, whether recent SSTI pre-
ceded or was a consequence of participants’ S. aureus nasal carriage could not be investigated
with our study design. Fourth, Wardyn et al. did not describe S. aureus nasal carriage status
among individuals who reported SSTI. Thus, any association between antecedent S. aureus
nasal carriage and SSTI in their study population is not known. The results presented here pro-
vide some of the first insights into the association between nasal carriage of S. aureus with mul-
tiple indicators of livestock association and prevalence of SSTI among IHO workers and their
household contacts in the United States.
Because we asked participants about SSTI during the three months prior to and including
the enrollment session, we were unable to assess whether the S. aureus present in participants'
nares were the same strains responsible for recent SSTI. However, we observedassociations
between nasal carriage of S. aureus, MDRSA, and S. aureus with indicators of livestock associa-
tion (absence of scn) and self-reported SSTI. Additionally, risk factors for community-associ-
ated and healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant S. aureus infection (e.g. recent use of
antibiotics, playing contact sports, recent use of a gym) were uncommon among IHO workers
and their household members. Some risk factors were more common among minors (specifi-
cally, playing contact sports and recent use of a gym).
S5 Table depicts the frequency and distribution of S. aureus spa types observedamong
workers and household members. Fifty-nine of the 81 households enrolled in this study con-
tained more than one study participant. Ten of these households contained at least two

 individuals who shared the same S. aureus spa type at baseline (S6 Table). Seven of these ten
were worker-household member pairs, two of ten were worker-worker pairs, and one of ten
was a household member-household member pair. Shared spa types included: t094, t233, t337,
t4976, t5739, t645, t659, t701 and t7226. S. aureus strains that were concordant between work-
ers and their household members generally did not have characteristics of livestock association
(CC398, CC9, tetracycline resistance or absence of scn). One worker-household member pair
shared a tetracycline-resistant spa type (t701) and one worker-worker pair shared a S. aureus
spa type associated with CC9 (t337), which was also scn-negative. One worker-household
member pair shared the same spa type (t4976), but only the worker carried S. aureus with an
indicator of livestock association (tetracycline resistance).
Although ten of 59 households contained participants who shared the same S. aureus spa
type, we observedlittle evidence of household transmission of livestock-associated S. aureus.
Other studies have detected S. aureus CC398 transmission between occupationally-exposed
individuals (i.e. livestock veterinarians) and their household members [44]. We may not have
observedtransmission of livestock-associated S. aureus in this study population because it does
not occur, or because of limitations in our study design. First, we examined transmission events
in the context of a cross-sectional analysis. Since transmission events may be infrequent [16], a
longitudinal study design might be better suited to capture transmission events. Further, we
only examined one S. aureus isolate per nasal swab for spa type and indicators of livestock asso-
ciation. Since a portion (~7%) of S. aureus-colonized individuals carries multiple strain types
simultaneously [45], it is possible we missed some instances of concordance. Finally, we
assessed transmission events based on shared spa types between household members. How-
ever, recent whole genome sequencing studies have demonstrated that shared spa types may
not indicate true transmission events; both false positives and false negatives are possible
[46,47].
There were several limitations to our assessment of S. aureus-related carriage outcomes.
First, because we directly plated nasal swabs, our sensitivity to detect MRSA may have been
lower than if we used an antibiotic-supplemented enrichment broth [48]. However, MRSA
prevalence among IHO workers in this study (1%) was comparable to a previous study of IHO
workers we conducted in this same region (3%) [38], in which an antibiotic-supplemented
enrichment broth was used. Second, since ~7% of S. aureus-colonized individuals carry multi-
ple S. aureus strains simultaneously[45], as mentioned previously, we may not have captured
the true distribution of S. aureus-related outcomes in this population. Third, we only assessed
S. aureus nasal carriage to maximize participant acceptability. However, S. aureus colonization
has been documented at additional body sites [49]. It is possible that we underestimated S.
aureus carriage by not swabbing other body sites. However, it is likely that such underestima-
tion would have been non-differential with respect to the outcome (i.e., similar among individ-
uals with and without recent SSTI), which could have had an attenuating influence on our PR
(95% CI) estimates. Other common S. aureus body colonization sites of IHO workers (e.g. axil-
lary, inguinal, and rectal areas) are more likely to be protected in the IHO environment than
the anterior nares. Thus, the possibility that we greatly underestimated S. aureus body carriage
is likely to be low. Fourth, IHO workers and their household members volunteered to partici-
pate in this study; participants were not randomly selected from an enumerated population
(e.g. employee roster/records). Thus, it is unclear how generalizable our findings are to all live-
stock workers in North Carolina or the United States. Nevertheless, the potential for exposure
to and infection with antibiotic-resistant S. aureus among the estimated 292,000 livestock
workers employed in the United States in 2012 [50–52] merits further investigation. Based on
the demographics of our study population (>90% Hispanic; <50% health insurance) IHO
workers in NC may be particularly vulnerable, as they may not have access to healthcare

 systems and thus may be difficult to capture via medical records-based or passive surveillance
studies.
Additional research is needed to establish the direction and temporality of the association
between nasal carriage of livestock-associated, antibiotic-resistant S. aureus and SSTI. In this
study population, we observedthat nasal carriage of S. aureus, including MDRSA, and scn-neg-
ative S. aureus, was more common among individuals who reported recent symptoms of SSTI.
This association is in accordance with previously observedassociations between S. aureus nasal
carriage and infection in clinical settings [12], and provides some of the first evidence in the
United States of a potential link between nasal carriage of livestock-associated S. aureus (a
modifiable potential risk factor for infection) and SSTI. Because few cases of SSTI were
reported, future studies should examine this association in a larger cohort and over time to
assess its repeatability and directionality. Overall, this study adds to the growing body of evi-
dence suggesting that individuals exposed to livestock-associated, antibiotic-resistant S. aureus,
MRSA, and MDRSA via hog production work in the United States could be at risk for SSTI.
