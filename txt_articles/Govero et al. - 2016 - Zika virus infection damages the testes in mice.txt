Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus (ZIKV) can cause 
congenital malformations including microcephaly, which has 
focused global attention on this emerging pathogen1. In addition 
to transmission by mosquitoes, ZIKV can be detected in the 
seminal fluid of affected males for extended periods of time and 
transmitted sexually2. Here, using a mouse-adapted African ZIKV 
strain (Dakar 41519), we evaluated the consequences of infection 
in the male reproductive tract of mice. We observed persistence of 
ZIKV, but not the closely related dengue virus (DENV), in the testis 
and epididymis of male mice, and this was associated with tissue 
injury that caused diminished testosterone and inhibin B levels 
and oligospermia. ZIKV preferentially infected spermatogonia, 
primary spermatocytes and Sertoli cells in the testis, resulting in 
cell death and destruction of the seminiferous tubules. Less damage 
was caused by a contemporary Asian ZIKV strain (H/PF/2013), in 
part because this virus replicates less efficiently in mice. The extent 
to which these observations in mice translate to humans remains 
unclear, but longitudinal studies of sperm function and viability in 
ZIKV-infected humans seem warranted.
We and others have observed that infection of male adult mice 
with ZIKV results in infection of the testes3,4, which is consistent with 
observed male-to-female5,6 and male-to-male7 sexual transmission in 
humans. To address the effects of infection on the male reproductive 
tract, we performed a longitudinal study in wild-type C57BL/6 mice 
infected with ZIKV (strains H/PF/2013 (French Polynesia 2013) or 
mouse-adapted Dakar 41519 (Senegal 1984)) or DENV (serotype 2, 
strain D2S20). Because ZIKV and DENV do not efficiently antagonize 
 
type I interferon (IFN) signalling in mice compared to humans8, 
animals were treated with a single dose of IFNα 
 and IFNβ 
 receptor 1 
 
(Ifnar1)–blocking monoclonal antibody to facilitate infection and 
 
dissemination. When wild-type mice were treated with an isotype-control 
 
antibody instead and then infected, ZIKV RNA did not accumulate in 
the testes (Fig. 1a).
In the presence of the anti-Ifnar1 antibody, high levels of viral RNA 
(105–108 focus-forming unit (FFU) equivalents per g or ml) and infec-
tious virus (up to 108 plaque-forming units (PFU) per g or ml) were 
detected in the testis, epididymis and the fluid collected from the 
epididymis within seven days of infection with either of the two ZIKV 
strains but not DENV (Fig. 1a–c). ZIKV-Dakar replicated to higher 
levels than ZIKV-H/PF/2013, which is consistent with the enhanced 
virulence of ZIKV-Dakar in wild-type mice3. Notably, ZIKV RNA and 
infectious virus were also detected in mature sperm collected from 
the epididymis (Fig. 1b, c, and Extended Data Fig. 1). At day 7 after 
inoculation, ZIKV-infected testes appeared similar in size to uninfected 
testes from age-matched mice and had equivalent weights (Fig. 1d, e). 
Histological analysis of ZIKV-infected testis and epididymis at day 7 
revealed no apparent differences in architecture (Fig. 1f and Extended 
Data Fig. 2). However, staining for CD45 (a pan-leukocyte marker) 
was observed in testis sections only from ZIKV-infected animals, with 
CD45+ cells localizing to the interstitium between the seminiferous 
tubules (Fig. 1g, column 1). The blood–testis barrier (BTB) remained 
intact at day 7 after infection, as shown by equivalent staining of the 
ETV5 transcription factor (which mediates BTB function and testicular 
immune privilege9) in Sertoli and germ cells in sections from unin-
fected and ZIKV-infected mice (Fig. 1g, column 2). Furthermore, there 
was no CD45 staining on the seminiferous tubular side of the BTB, near 
the TRA98+ germ cells or spermatogonia (Fig. 1g, column 1). A similar 
pattern of CD45 staining in the testicular interstitium and epididymal 
epithelium was described in patients infected with HIV10; indeed, we 
also observed scattered CD45+ cells in the epididymal epithelium of 
ZIKV-infected mice (Fig. 1g, column 5). However, at day 7, F4/80+ 
macrophages were not apparent in the testicular interstitium or the 
lumenal epithelium of the epididymis of ZIKV-infected mice (Fig. 1g, 
columns 3 and 4).
To determine which cells were targeted by ZIKV
, we performed in situ 
hybridization (ISH) for viral RNA at day 7 after infection. In the testis, 
 
ZIKV RNA was evident in spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes 
and the trophic, inhibin B-producing Sertoli cells (Fig. 1h, left), with 
relative sparing of the androgen-producing Leydig cells. In the cauda 
epididymis, mature sperm in the lumen stained strongly for ZIKV 
RNA (Fig. 1h, right) as did sperm cells collected from the epididymis 
(Extended Data Fig. 1).
We followed the consequences of ZIKV infection of the male repro-
ductive tract over time. At day 14 after inoculation, high levels of ZIKV 
RNA persisted in the testis, epididymis, the fluid from the epididymis 
and mature sperm of most mice (Fig. 2a). In ZIKV-Dakar-infected ani-
mals, there was a noticeable decrease in testis size and weight (Fig. 2b, c). 
 
In comparison, no noticeable infection by DENV was observed in the 
testis at this time point (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Histological analysis of 
the ZIKV-infected testis at day 14 showed damage to the architecture of 
the seminiferous tubules with loss of the central ductal lumen (Fig. 2d). 
This was associated with decreased numbers of TRA98+ germ cells and 
Lina28a+ type A and B spermatogonia, morphological abnormalities of 
GATA4+ Sertoli cells and detachment of Sertoli cells from the basement 
membrane (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2). In some regions, large 
numbers of CD45+ leukocytes were observed, suggesting substantial 
inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 2d, left; e, column 1). The absence 
of ETV5+ cells at this time point indicates loss of integrity of the BTB, 
which could explain the extent of interstitial inflammation and F4/80+ 
macrophages in the affected testis. The epididymis of ZIKV-infected 
animals also showed tissue injury at day 14, as indicated by constriction 
of the epididymal lumen, thickening of inter-luminal tissue and accu-
mulation of sperm interspersed with necrotic bodies (Fig. 2d, e, right). 
ISH at day 14 showed progressive evidence of ZIKV RNA in cells of 
the testis, in the mature lumenal sperm and on cilia layering the inner 
lumen of the epididymis, similar to day 7 (Fig. 2f).
High levels of viral RNA persisted in tissues of the male reproduc-
tive tract at 21 days after ZIKV-Dakar inoculation (Fig. 3a), and this

was associated with a loss of tissue architecture. Involution of the testis 
was observed, indicated by their noticeably reduced size and weight 
 
(Fig. 3b, c). Histological analysis revealed almost complete destruction 
of the seminiferous epithelium with constricted tubules after ZIKV 
infection (Fig. 3d). The populations of spermatogonia, Sertoli cells and 
3β 
-HSD+ Leydig cells were markedly diminished, and this was associ-
ated with persistent CD45+ leukocyte infiltration (Fig. 3e and Extended 
Data Fig. 2). In the epididymis, ZIKV infection resulted in constric-
tion of the lumen with a mass of residual sperm that was interspersed

with necrotic bodies (Fig. 3d). ISH showed viral RNA in remaining 
testicular cells of the damaged testis and in the lumenal sperm of the 
infected epididymis (Fig. 3f). Damage to the seminiferous tubules in 
the testis, albeit at lower levels, was also observed in mice infected 
with the epidemic ZIKV-H/PF/2013 strain at day 28 after infection 
(Extended Data Fig. 3b, c).
The RNA ISH analysis suggested that Sertoli cells were tar-
geted by ZIKV in the testis. Sertoli cells provide a trophic function 
for spermatogenesis and express high levels of the TAM receptors 
Tyro3, Axl and Mertk11. Because Axl has recently been postulated 
as an entry factor for ZIKV infection into cells12–16, we assessed the 
effect of a genetic deficiency of Axl on ZIKV infection of the testis 
and epididymis. As we found high levels of infection in the testis and 
epididymis in Axl−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 4a), this TAM receptor 
probably does not have an essential role in ZIKV pathogenesis in the 
male reproductive tract. ISH showed strong staining of viral RNA in 
both Sertoli and germ cells in Axl−/− mice at day 7 after ZIKV infection 
(Extended Data Fig. 4b).

The histological analysis showed that injury of the testis was asso-
ciated with inflammatory cell infiltration. To assess the role of adap-
tive immune cells in the pathogenesis of acute disease, we inoculated 
Rag1−/− mice, which lack both mature B and T cells, with ZIKV after 
a similar treatment with anti-Ifnar1 antibody. At day 7, we observed 
high levels of viral RNA in all male reproductive tract tissues (Extended 
Data Fig. 4a). At day 13, we observed ZIKV RNA in germ and Sertoli 
cells in Rag1−/− mice, and this was associated with a decrease in 
TRA98+ germ cells and Lin28a+ spermatogonia and breakdown of 
the BTB. However, interstitial Leydig cells remained in ZIKV-infected 
Rag1−/− mice even though the architecture of the seminiferous tubules 
was altered (Extended Data Fig. 4c–d). Thus, damage to the testis 
appears to be mediated both by ZIKV infection and adaptive immune 
 
responses.
To determine the functional consequences of ZIKV-Dakar infec-
tion in the testis, we measured the levels of two hormones important 
for spermatogenesis, testosterone and inhibin B, which are produced 
by Leydig and Sertoli cells, respectively. At day 7 after ZIKV infec-
tion, testosterone levels in homogenates of testes were increased, 
possibly because of the altered cellular physiology or inflammatory 
environment associated with viral replication17. By day 14, testos-
terone levels in ZIKV-infected mice were decreased and remained 
low at 21 days (Fig. 4a, left). Inhibin B levels were also reduced in 
ZIKV-infected testes at days 14 and 21 after infection (Fig. 4a, right). 
We observed diminished total and motile sperm counts from fluid 
 
collected from the cauda epididymis at 14 (Fig. 4b) or approximately 42 
 
(Fig. 4c) days after ZIKV inoculation, which was consistent with 
extensive damage to the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 2d–f and 
Extended Data Figs 2, 5a, b). We also observed reduced rates of 
 
pregnancy and numbers of viable fetuses from females mated with 
ZIKV-infected males compared to uninfected males (Fig. 4d). 
Consistent with substantial injury to the testis, there was marked 
cell death in the seminiferous tubules and lumen of the epididymis 
at multiple time points, as indicated by TUNEL staining (Fig. 4e) and 
loss of cellularity (Fig. 3e, f). Thus, in mice, the injury to the male 
reproductive tract due to ZIKV infection results in decreased sex 
hormone production and oligospermia. ZIKV pathogenesis in the 
testis appears distinct from that of mumps virus, which preferentially 
infects interstitial Leydig cells and causes highly inflammatory acute 
orchitis18,19.
In most human infections, ZIKV causes a mild febrile illness associ-
ated with rash and conjunctivitis. However, severe phenotypes are now 
appreciated, including Guillain-Barré syndrome20,21 and congenital 
abnormalities in fetuses22. ZIKV can be transmitted sexually, in con-
trast to related flaviviruses, as infectious virus persists in the semen of 
males23–25 for up to 80 days after symptom onset2. Our experiments 
with mouse-adapted ZIKV-Dakar show that infection causes testicular 
and epididymal damage in mice that can progress to reductions in key 
sex hormones, destruction of germ and somatic cells in the testis, and 
loss of mature sperm and fertility. Sertoli cells may be a key target for 
ZIKV in the testis, resulting in cell dysfunction, detachment from the 
basement membrane and dissolution of the BTB. Infiltrating inflam-
matory cells may amplify destruction of the testicular architecture. 
Although further studies are required, this pathologic process results 
in decreased male fertility, at least in mice. While Axl is not required 
for infection of the mouse testis, other TAM or T-cell immunoglobulin 
and mucin domain (TIM)15 receptors could be important for ZIKV 
tropism.
The establishment of a model of male reproductive tract injury after 
ZIKV infection will allow the rapid testing of new classes of therapeutic 
agents26,27 or vaccines28 to mitigate or prevent disease. Although our 
data are concerning for yet another unanticipated clinical manifesta-
tion of ZIKV infection, we acknowledge these results reflect studies 
exclusively performed in mice. Nonetheless, genitourinary signs and 
symptoms, including haematospermia, dysuria and perineal pain5,6,29, 
have been reported in ZIKV-infected humans and ZIKV was recently 
detected in human spermatozoa30. Longitudinal studies monitoring 
ZIKV infection in semen and sperm counts seem warranted to define 
the extent and consequences of this disease process in affected human 
males.

Ethics statement. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommen-
dations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National 
Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (Assurance 
number A3381-01). Inoculations were performed under anaesthesia induced and 
maintained with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all efforts were made 
to minimize animal suffering.
Viruses. ZIKV strain H/PF/2013 (French Polynesia, 2013) was provided by the 
Arbovirus Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with permis-
sion (X. de Lamballerie). ZIKV strain Dakar 41519 (Senegal, 1984) was provided by 
the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (R. Tesh) and 
passaged twice in Rag1−/− mice to create a mouse-adapted, more pathogenic variant 
 
of ZIKV-Dakar (M. Gorman and M. Diamond, unpublished results). DENV-2 
(strain D2S20) was obtained as a gift (S. Shresta). Virus stocks were propagated in 
mycoplasma-free Vero cells (ATCC) and titrated by focus-forming assay (FFA), 
as described previously3.
Mouse infection experiments. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased commer-
cially (Jackson Laboratories) and congenic Rag1−/− mice were bred at Washington 
University in a pathogen-free facility. Congenic Axl−/− mice were described 
 
previously31. Seven-week-old mice were inoculated by subcutaneous route in the 
footpad with 103 (H/PF/2013) or 106 (Dakar 41519 or DENV-2) FFU in a volume 
of 50 μ 
l. One-day before inoculation with virus, mice were treated with 0.5 or 2 mg 
of an Ifnar1-blocking mouse antibody (MAR1-5A3) or isotype control mouse 
antibody (GIR-208) by intraperitoneal injection3. At different days after infection, 
tissues were collected and processed as described below. Testis and epididymis 
collected from infected male mice were processed for haematoxylin and eosin 
staining, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, ISH and viral titer analysis 
as described previously32. Testes were also examined macroscopically and weighed. 
At days 14, 21 and around 42 after ZIKV-Dakar infection, the macroscopic dam-
age as indicated by a reduction in size was often uniformly bilateral, although 
some asymmetry in testis (right versus left) size was observed. Randomization and 
blinding of the animal experiments were not performed, and sample sizes were 
not calculated beforehand.
Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Mature sperm from the cauda 
epididymis of uninfected or virus-infected mice were collected immediately after 
euthanasia as reported earlier33. The sperm suspension in vitrofert medium (Cook 
Medical) was analysed for total sperm count by CASA using the HTM-IVOS Vs12 
integrated visual optical system motility analyser (Hamilton-Thorne Research) 
as described previously34. For studies at around 42 day after infection, mice were 
killed at day 41 (n = 
 3), 42 (n = 
 4), 43 (n = 
 3), and 48 (n = 
 1) after infection with 
103 to 106 FFU of ZIKV-Dakar. All measurements of total and motile sperm were 
made within 60 min of dissection of the cauda epididymis.
Testosterone and inhibin B levels. Total homogenates of testes from uninfected 
or ZIKV-infected mice were assayed for testosterone and inhibin B levels by radi-
oimmunoassay as described17 using the Research in Reproduction Ligand Assay 
and Analysis Core at the University of Virginia.
Fertility studies. Age-matched uninfected or ZIKV-infected wild-type C57BL/6 
males (at days 7, 16 or 26 after infection, n = 
 4–5 at each time point) were mated 
with single 8-week-old female wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Five days later, males 
were removed from the cage to isolate the females. Ten days later, female mice 
(n = 
 14–15 for each group) were euthanized and evaluated for pregnancy, and the 
number of viable or resorbed fetuses was counted. Because sperm from mice can 
be obtained only at euthanasia, we were unable to perform longitudinal studies and 
directly correlate sperm counts after ZIKV infection with fertility rates.
Viral burden. ZIKV- or DENV-infected mice were euthanized on specific 
days. Testis, epididymis and other tissues were weighed and homogenized with 
 
zirconia beads in a MagNA Lyser instrument (Roche Life Science) in 200 μ 
l PBS. 
 
All homogenized tissues from infected animals were stored at − 
80 °C. With some 
samples, viral burden was determined by plaque assay on Vero cells35. Sperm were 
subjected to three rapid freeze-thaw cycles to release infectious virus. Other samples 
 
were extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit. ZIKV and DENV RNA levels were 
determined by one-step quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT–PCR) on 
an ABI 7500 Fast Instrument using standard cycling conditions. Viral burden was 
expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA equivalents per g or ml after comparison 
with a standard curve produced using serial tenfold dilutions of ZIKV or DENV 
RNA as described previously35. For ZIKV, the following primer sets were used: 
1183F: 5′ 
-CCACCAATGTTCTCTTGCAGACATATTG-3′ 
; 1268R: 5′ 
-TTCGGA 
CAGCCGTTGTCCAACACAAG-3′ 
; and probes (1213F): 5′ 
-56-FAM/AGCCTA 
CCT TGACAAGCAGTC/3IABkFQ-3′ 
.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Tissues were collected after death and 
fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Subsequently, 5-μ 
m-thick 
testis and epididymal sections from infected and uninfected mice were processed 
for histology by haematoxylin and eosin staining. For immunohistochemistry, 
the tissue sections were incubated with mouse primary monoclonal anti-CD45 
(610266; BD Biosciences), anti-ETV5 (ab102010; Abcam), anti-GATA4 (ab84593; 
Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-Lin28a (3978S, Cell Signaling), rat polyclonal anti-
TRA98 (ab82527; Abcam), rat polyclonal anti-F4/80 (ab6640; Abcam), or goat 
polyclonal anti-3β 
-HSD antibodies (SC-30820, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After 
washing, slides were stained with Alexa Fluor 488- or, Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated 
goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-goat (1:1,000; A11008, A11081, 
A11030 or A11056; ThermoFisher Scientific) secondary antibodies for 1 h, and 
mounted with prolong gold anti-fade mount containing the nuclear counter stain, 
DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific). Immunostaining was detected by confocal 
microscopy (Leica SPE100, Germany).
Viral RNA in situ hybridization. RNA ISH was performed using RNAscope 2.5 
(Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PFA-
fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized by incubating for 
60 min at 60 °C. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with H2O2 for 10 min 
at room temperature. Slides were boiled for 15 min in RNAscope Target Retrieval 
Reagents and incubated for 30 min in RNAscope Protease Plus before probe 
hybridization. The probe targeting ZIKV RNA was designed and synthesized by 
Advanced Cell Diagnostics (Catalog #467871). Positive (targeting plr2a gene) and 
negative (targeting bacterial gene dapB) control probes also were obtained from 
Advanced Cell Diagnostics (Catalog #312471 and #310043, respectively). Tissues 
were counterstained with Gill’s haematoxylin and visualized using bright-field 
microscopy.
Data analysis. All data were analysed with GraphPad Prism software. For viral 
burden analysis, the log10 transformed titres were analysed by the Mann–Whitney 
test or a Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA. A P value of < 
0.05 indicated statistically 
significant differences.

the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable
