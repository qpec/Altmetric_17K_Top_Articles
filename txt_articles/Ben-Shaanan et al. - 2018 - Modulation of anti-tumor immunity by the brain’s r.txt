Regulating immunity is a leading target for cancer therapy. Here, we show that the anti-tumor
immune response can be modulated by the brain’s reward system, a key circuitry in emo-
tional processes. Activation of the reward system in tumor-bearing mice (Lewis lung carci-
noma (LLC) and B16 melanoma) using chemogenetics (DREADDs), resulted in reduced
tumor weight. This effect was mediated via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), mani-
fested by an attenuated noradrenergic input to a major immunological site, the bone marrow.
Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which develop in the bone marrow, became less
immunosuppressive following reward system activation. By depleting or adoptively trans-
ferring the MDSCs, we demonstrated that these cells are both necessary and sufficient to
mediate reward system effects on tumor growth. Given the central role of the reward system
in positive emotions, these findings introduce a physiological mechanism whereby the
patient’s psychological state can impact anti-tumor immunity and cancer progression.

pidemiological evidence supports a connection between the
patient’s mental state and cancer survival1,2. Nevertheless,
many of these studies have yielded inconsistent results3,4,
and our understanding of the central neuronal mechanisms
underlying the effect of emotional states on cancer is limited.
Moreover, most research in this field has been focused on nega-
tive emotional states, such as stress and depression5,6, while the
impact of positive mental attributes on cancer biology is largely
unknown.
The brain’s reward system, specifically the dopaminergic neu-
rons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), constitutes a key
neuronal network whose activation mediates positive emotions,
expectations, and motivation7–9. The dopaminergic projections
from the VTA to components of the limbic system are causally
associated with motivated behavior and reward perception10,11.
Pharmacological studies indicated a connection between reward
system activity and immune modulation12–14, and we recently
showed that reward system activity can boost antibacterial
immunity15.
Immune system activity is crucial for controlling the initiation
and progression of tumors. However, the immune system can
also act as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it generates
effector cells, such as CD8 T cells and NK cells that can eliminate
tumors16,17. On the other hand, some immune cell subsets, such
as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), act to support
tumor growth by suppressing the anti-tumor immune response
and by generating a favorable environment for the tumor (e.g.,
promoting angiogenesis)18.
Thus, given the importance of the immune system in tumor
biology, and since reward system activity affects immunity, we
test here the hypothesis that reward system activity could affect
tumor growth. We used chemogenetics, which enables targeted
neuronal manipulation19, to reveal a causal connection between
reward system activity and alterations in anti-cancer immunity.
We demonstrate, using two murine tumor models (Lewis lung
carcinoma (LLC) and B16 melanoma), that chemogenetic
activation of the reward system attenuates tumor growth. This
manipulation also resulted in reduced sympathetic activity in
the bone marrow, evident by attenuated noradrenaline (NA)
levels. We further showed that MDSCs that develop in the bone
marrow are functionally affected by the noradrenergic input.
Thus, following reward system activation, MDSCs exhibited an
attenuated
immunosuppressive
profile,
which
manifested
in vivo by increased expression of Granzyme B by tumor CD8
T cells. By depleting and adoptively transferring MDSCs, we
showed that these cells are both necessary and sufficient to
mediate the effects of reward system activation on tumor
growth.
Results
Specific and functional DREADD expression in the VTA.
Given the central role of the immune system in fighting cancer,
and given the effects of reward system activity on immunity, we
hypothesized that reward system activity could also affect tumor
growth. To test this hypothesis, we used Designer Receptor
Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to speci-
fically control reward system activity. DREADDs are mutated
muscarinic receptors that no longer respond to their endogenous
ligand20. Instead, upon exposure to a synthetic ligand, clozapine-
N-oxide (CNO), stimulatory DREADDs (hM3D(Gq)) elicit an
intracellular
cascade
that
leads
to
neuronal
activation21.
DREADDs were expressed in VTA dopaminergic neurons, using
an adeno associated virus (AAV)-based vector. The virus carried
a gene encoding the DREADD receptor and an mCherry fluor-
escent reporter. We used stereotactic injections to deliver the
virus directly to the VTA, and a Cre-dependent system to ensure
virus expression specifically by the VTA dopaminergic neurons22
(Fig. 1a). As controls in this study, we injected mice with the same
virus encoding the fluorescent reporter, mCherry, but lacking the
DREADD gene (control virus). This enabled us to control for any
potential local inflammatory response induced by the viral
infection, effects of surgery, and CNO administration.
The efficiency of virus-expression among the VTA dopami-
nergic neurons was validated using immunohistochemistry. We
analyzed the co-labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker
for dopaminergic neurons23,24, and mCherry, indicating virus
expression (Fig. 1b). We found that 57.3 ± 5% of the TH+
neurons in our control mice (injected with the control virus that
lacks the information for DREADDs) and 64.7 ± 3.4% of TH+
neurons in the experimental mice expressed the viral vector (P =
0.29; Supplementary Fig. 1; Student’s t-test), rendering them
potentially amenable for manipulation using DREADDs. We also
confirmed that DREADDs expression was restricted to the VTA
as demonstrated by the lack of mCherry labeling in additional
brain regions (nucleus accumbens, lateral hypothalamus and
frontal cortex) (Supplementary Fig. 2). To validate neuronal
activation following daily CNO injection, we used immunohis-
tochemical analysis of c-Fos, an early activation marker. Indeed,
60.9 ± 4% of the DREADD-expressing VTA neurons were c-Fos
+, compared to 34.5 ± 6% in the mice injected with the control
virus (P < 0.005; Fig. 1c; Supplementary Fig. 3; Student’s t-test).
VTA activation attenuates tumor growth. To analyze the effect
of VTA activation on tumor growth, we used the solid tumor
model LLC. We subcutaneously (s.c.) injected the LLC cells to the
lower right flank of both DREADD-expressing mice and their
controls (expressing the control virus). Following the tumor cell
injection, we treated mice daily with CNO to induce VTA acti-
vation (controls were also treated with CNO; Fig. 1a). After
14 days of repeated VTA activation, tumor size was reduced by
46.5 ± 17.6% and tumor weight by 52.4 ± 15.1% (P < 0.014, P <
0.003, respectively) in the VTA-activated mice when compared to
the controls (Fig. 1d–f). Reward system activation was also
effective in reducing tumor size in an additional murine cancer
model, the B16 melanoma model. As with the LLC model, we s.c.
injected mice with B16 tumor cells and activated their reward
system daily. In this cancer model, reward system activation
reduced tumor weight by 38 ± 11.99% when compared to controls
(P < 0.03; Fig. 1g), indicating that the effects of VTA activation
were not limited to a single cancer model. Yet, as the effect was
more profound with the LLC, we focused on this model for the
remainder of the study. With this model, we tested an additional
reward system activation regimen, every other day (instead of
every day). To maintain the same number of VTA activation
sessions, we continued this experiment for 28 days (instead of
14 days). As shown in Fig. 1h, this less frequent manipulation
regimen, also reduced tumor weight by 28 ± 11.7% (P < 0.006).
Taken together, the use of DREADDs, which enables causal
connections to be established25, revealed that VTA activation
reduces tumor growth. However, it is unlikely that this is a direct
effect, as dopamine does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB),
raising the question of how the signal is transmitted from the
brain to the tumor.
Necessity of sympathetic nervous system for VTA’s effect on
tumor. Previous findings indicate that reward system activity
affects the sympathetic nervous system (SNS)15,26. Other studies
demonstrate
that
sympathetic
activity
affects
cancer
progression27,28. Thus, we hypothesized that the SNS is likely to
be involved in mediating the signal from the VTA to affect tumor

 growth. To directly test this hypothesis, we treated DREADD-
expressing mice and their controls with 6-hydroxydopamine
(6OHDA; intraperitoneal injection). 6OHDA systemically ablates
catecholaminergic neurons comprising the SNS29. 6OHDA does
not cross the BBB29, and thus, when injected to the periphery, its
effect is considered to be limited to the peripheral SNS innerva-
tions. Accordingly, 6OHDA had no effect on the number of TH+
cells in the VTA of the tumor-bearing mice (P < 0.69; Supple-
mentary Fig. 4). In these sympathetically ablated mice, VTA
activation had no effect on tumor weight (P < 0.8825; Fig. 2a)
demonstrating the requirement of the SNS in mediating VTA
effects on the tumor. We further validated the SNS involvement
in mediating reward system effects by treating the VTA-activated
mice and controls with a blocker to one of the main NA recep-
tors, the β-adrenergic receptor. Nadolol is a β-adrenergic blocker
that does not cross the BBB30 and thus, inhibits β-adrenergic
receptors in the periphery. Similarly to 6OHDA treatment,
Nadolol eliminated the effects of VTA-activation on tumor
weight (P < 0.4283; Fig. 2b). Thus, we conclude that sympathetic
activity is required to mediate the reward system effects on
tumor growth.
SNS activity is commonly associated with the stress response.
Therefore, we analyzed the levels of the stress hormone,
corticosterone, in VTA-activated mice and their controls. We
could not detect any difference in plasma corticosterone between
the two groups (P < 0.81; Fig. 2c). However, the SNS also directly
innervates organs relevant to cancer biology, including some
tumors27,31 and all immune organs32,33. These innervations
enable local control of sympathetic activity at the target site34,35.
Thus, we analyzed whether VTA activation had any effect on
these local sympathetic innervations, measuring the levels of the
primary SNS neurotransmitter, NA, in various target sites. VTA
activation had no significant effect on plasma and spleen NA
levels (determined by ELISA; P < 0.89, P < 0.16; Fig. 2d, e;
Supplementary Fig. 5), though at the tumor site, we observed
some, non-significant (P < 0.107) reductions in NA level (Fig. 2f;
Supplementary Fig. 5). However, in the bone marrow of VTA-
activated mice, NA levels were significantly reduced by 24.6 ±
0.1% (P < 0.044; Fig. 2g; Supplementary Fig. 5). We verified this
finding by staining the bone marrow for TH, an enzyme that
participates in NA synthesis and is expressed by sympathetic
fibers in the periphery36. We found a 50.5 ± 22.3% reduction in

activated mice compared to their controls (P < 0.044; Fig. 2h, i).
Functional β2-adrenergic receptor on bone marrow MDSCs.
The bone marrow is a particularly important site for the anti-
tumor immune response37,38. During cancer progression, the
bone marrow is characterized by extensive proliferation of mye-
loid cells, especially of MDSCs (identified by Gr-1+ CD11b+
expression)39,40. In the LLC model, this heterogeneous popula-
tion, including neutrophils41, comprises a major fraction of cells
in the bone marrow of tumor-bearing mice39,42 (on average
81.6 ± 1.6% of the bone marrow cell population 28 days after s.c.
injection of LLC; Fig. 3a). MDSCs support tumor progression by
various mechanisms including promoting angiogenesis and sup-
pressing anti-tumor immunity42,43. Given that VTA activation
specifically reduced NA levels in the bone marrow and given the
high abundance of MDSCs in this site, we decided to focus on
these cells. Moreover, previous studies showed that SNS activity
affects myeloid population in the bone marrow44–47.
First, we evaluated whether MDSCs could be affected by the
change in NA levels, and analyzed their expression of the β2

 adrenergic receptor. We focused on this receptor because it was
already shown that it is commonly expressed on immune cells48,
and it was consistent with our finding that the β-blocker, Nadolol,
abrogated VTA-activation effects on tumor growth (Fig. 2b). We
compared β2 adrenergic receptor mRNA levels expressed by two
main subsets of bone marrow MDSCs: monocytic MDSCs (M-
MDSCs; CD11b+ Ly6C+) and polymorphonuclear MDSCs
(PMN-MDSCs; CD11b+ Ly6G+). While both MDSCs subsets
expressed the β2 adrenergic receptor, receptor levels on PMN-
MDSCs were 3.2-fold higher compared to M-MDSCs (P < 0.004;
Fig. 3b). Next, we tested whether the β2 adrenergic receptor was
not only expressed by these cells, but also functionally active. NA
signaling is known to activate an intracellular cascade leading to
CREB phosphorylation49, thus to evaluate the activity of the
receptor, we assessed pCREB levels. We exposed PMN-MDSCs
and M-MDSCs to a β-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol) in vitro.
PMN-MDSCs manifested a significantly greater increase in
pCREB levels compared to M-MDSCs following exposure to
the β-agonist (P < 0.0004, P < 0.023, respectively; Fig. 3c; Supple-
mentary Fig. 6), in agreement with their elevated expression of
the β2 adrenergic receptor (Fig. 3b). Although PMN-MDSCs
were more reactive than M-MDSCs to NA signaling, both
populations responded to this signal. Moreover, VTA activation
had no effect on the relative abundance of the two subpopulations
(P < 0.22 for PMN-MDSCs and P < 0.64 for M-MDSCs; Supple-
mentary Fig. 7); therefore, we continued our analysis on the total
MDSC population. We found that the overall expression levels of
the β2 adrenergic receptor on MDSCs isolated from the bone
marrow were 2.49-fold higher compared to MDSCs isolated from
the tumor (P < 0.015; Fig. 3d), suggesting that bone marrow
MDSCs are more susceptible to changes in NA levels. Interest-
ingly, VTA activation reduced NA levels mainly in the bone
marrow (Fig. 2g–i).
To determine the direct effects of NA on MDSCs, we isolated
these cells from the bone marrow of tumor-bearing mice and
incubated them in vitro with the β-adrenergic agonist (Fig. 3e).
We screened for changes in the expression of known mediators
that can affect tumor growth. Specifically, we analyzed mRNA
levels of the angiogenic factor VEGF42, the pro-tumorigenic
cytokine TGFβ50, the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 as well

 as the regulatory factors iNOS and TNF-α50–52. This analysis
revealed that following β-adrenergic agonist treatment, the main
significant effect was a reduction in TNF-α expression levels by
MDSCs (P < 0.016; Fig. 3f; Supplementary Fig. 8). TNF-α is a
potent anti-tumor cytokine that has a disputed, yet central role in
cancer biology53. Given that the β-adrenergic agonist decreased
TNF-α expression in the bone marrow MDSCs, we expected that
in the VTA-activated mice, which had reduced NA levels, MDSCs
would manifest an increase in TNF-α. Accordingly, flow
cytometry analysis revealed a significant increase in TNF-α levels
in MDSCs from the bone marrow and spleen (P < 0.027, P <
0.039, respectively; Fig. 3g, h). This increase was specific to TNF-
α, as other markers such as IFN-γ, iNOS, Arginase, IDO, PDL-1,
and VEGF were not affected (P < 0.98, P < 0.44, P < 0.34, P < 0.35,
P < 0.36, and P < 0.95, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 9). More-
over, CD31 mRNA levels in the tumor site were unchanged
following VTA activation (P < 0.41; Supplementary Fig. 10).
. Taken together, following VTA activation, we observed a
decrease in NA levels in the bone marrow but not in the spleen or
tumor site.
Thus, it is possible that this change in the bone
marrow, the milieu, where the MDSCs develop, affected their
subsequent functional profile at other sites.
One of the pro-tumorigenic functions of MDSCs is their ability
to suppress T-cell activation and proliferation. Therefore, we
treated MDSCs with the β-adrenergic agonist and incubated them
with activated T cells in vitro. We found that the β-adrenergic
agonist increased the immunosuppressive effect of MDSCs,
manifested by a reduction in CD4 T-cells proliferation (P <
0.007; Fig. 3i). In agreement with this in vitro finding, MDSCs
isolated from tumors of VTA-activated mice were less effective in
suppressing CD4 T cell proliferation compared to MDSCs
derived from controls (P < 0.004; Fig. 3j, k; Supplementary
Fig. 11). Moreover, CD4 T cells derived from the tumor site of
VTA-activated mice manifested elevated levels of the activation
marker, CD69 (P < 0.001; Fig. 3l).
Necessity and sufficiency of MDSCs on VTA’s effect. Although
CD69 is indicative of cell activation, it is not directly associated
with effector and cytotoxic functions. Therefore, we characterized
CD4 and CD8 populations in the spleen and tumor site. We
evaluated their abundance and expression of the cytokines IFN-γ,
TNF-α, and Granzyme B (on CD8 cells) (Supplementary Fig. 12).
We found a significant increase in Granzyme B expression on
CD8 T cells in the VTA-activated mice (P < 0.0159; Fig. 4a;
Supplementary Fig. 13). Granzyme B is known to have a cytotoxic
effects on target cells54 and thus, the increase in its levels further
supports the induction of anti-tumor immune response following
VTA activation. To determine whether this effect on Granzyme B
levels was dependent on MDSCs activity, we depleted the MDSC
population. We injected an anti-Gr-1 antibody to deplete the Gr-
1-positive populations in tumor-bearing VTA-activated mice and
controls. As shown in Fig. 4a, depletion of MDSCs eliminated the
effect of VTA activation on Granzyme B levels on CD8 T cells (P
< 0.1188). Moreover, we found that the tumor weight in these
anti-Gr-1-treated mice did not differ between the two experi-
mental groups, indicating the necessity of MDSCs in mediating
these effects (P < 0.3272; Fig. 4b).
Although we do not assume that MDSCs are the only cell
population affected by VTA activation, a change in these cells
might be sufficient to induce the reduction in tumor weight. To
directly address this question, we performed an adoptive transfer
experiment; MDSCs were isolated (based on their expression of
Gr-1 and CD11b) from tumors of VTA-activated mice and their
controls (carrying the control virus and treated with CNO). The
cells were then co-injected along with new tumor cells into naïve
recipient mice. As the recipient mice were injected with an equal
number of LLC cells and MDSCs (isolated from control or VTA-
activated mice), any difference in the evolving tumors could be
directly attributed to functional changes in the transferred cells
(Fig. 4c). After validation that the transferred MDSCs could
survive in the recipient mice (Supplementary Fig. 14) and that the
tumor cells were not immediately rejected in our experimental
paradigm (P < 0.24; Supplementary Fig. 15), we compared the
tumors in both groups. We found that when MDSCs were derived
from VTA-activated mice, the tumor size was reduced by 42.9 ±
13.4% and tumor weight was reduced by 43.6 ± 16.3% compared
to the controls (P < 0.008, P < 0.019, respectively; Fig. 4d–f),
indicating that the effect on MDSCs was sufficient to mediate the
VTA effects on tumor growth. Taken together, the transfer and
depletion experiments, demonstrated that MDSCs are both
sufficient and necessary to mediate VTA-induced effects on
tumor growth.
Discussion
Taken together, in this study, we establish a causal link between
reward system manipulation and tumor growth. We demonstrate
that although the effect is causal, the link is indirect. The
mechanism
is
dependent
on
SNS
activity,
specifically
β-
adrenergic input, and is mediated, at least in part, via MDSCs.
It should be noted that MDSCs are a heterogeneous population,
and the markers used for their characterization do not allow
distinguishing between MDSCs and neutrophils41. Moreover, it is
possible that additional effects induced by VTA activation are
independent of the effects on MDSCs. The observed decrease in
NA levels in the bone marrow following VTA activation is con-
sistent with previous studies indicating that VTA activity and
positive emotional state affect the SNS15,55. Moreover, the dif-
ferential control of sympathetic activity at specific organs was
described before47,56, though the mechanisms underlying such
specificity are, as yet, unknown.
Our analysis was focused on the effects of VTA activation on
the anti-tumor immune response, specifically MDSCs. However,
it is likely that such a brain manipulation will also affect other
physiological systems, which can also contribute to the observed
effects. It is important to note that we do not consider such robust
and specific modulations of VTA activity (as induced here by
DREADD activation) to be physiological and the relevance to
human cancer is still unknown. Moreover, in this study, we used
two tumor models that evaluate a specific aspect in tumor biol-
ogy, namely, primary tumor growth rates. Thus, other aspects of
cancer development and progression such as tumor initiation or
metastasis remain unknown. Thus, rather than dissecting the
specific molecular mechanisms mediating these effects, our study
aims to demonstrate a functional connection between a mood-
regulating neuronal circuit, such as the reward system, and tumor
growth.
Moreover, given the central role of the reward system in mood
regulation, the finding that the reward system can affect anti-
tumor immunity and tumor growth introduces a new mechanistic
insight into the epidemiological connection between mental states
and cancer progression.
Methods
Mice. Adult male (10–12 weeks of age; 20–25 g) TH-Cre mice (B6129X1-Th<tm1
(cre)Te>/Kieg; EMMA), GFP mice, and C57BL/6 mice were used in all experi-
ments. Mice were maintained under Specific-Pathogen-Free (SPF) conditions on a
12:12 h light cycle (lights on at 07:00). All experiments were performed in accor-
dance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. All procedures and protocols were approved by the Technion
Administrative Panel of Laboratory Animal Care.

 Stereotactic injection. As described before15, mice were anesthetized using a
ketamine/xylazine mixture (ketamine 80 mg/kg; xylazine 15–20 mg/kg) diluted in
sterile saline solution (NaCl 0.9%), before being fixed in a stereotactic frame
(Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA). Mice were randomly divided between VTA-
activated and control group. An AAV8 virus, (AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-
mCherry) purchased from the Vector Core at the University of North Carolina,
was used for Cre-dependent DREADD expression. We injected 0.7 μl of the virus
(1012–1013 vg/ml) into the right VTA region (anterior–posterior −3.2 mm;
medial–lateral 0.48 mm; dorsal–ventral 4.7 mm) of TH-Cre mice. Control mice
were injected with a sham AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry construct, lacking the
DREADD gene. This allowed us to control for local inflammatory response,
induced by the virus and CNO injection, and surgical procedure. Experiments were
performed 30 days after surgery to ensure the expression of the DREADD. Mice
showing signs of physical distress and pain were excluded from the experiment.
Following sacrifice, stereotactic injection sites were verified by
immunohistochemistry.
Cell lines and culture. The LLC and B16 melanoma cell lines were provided by the
research groups of professors Yuval Shaked and Yishai Ofran of the Technion’s
Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine. The cells were originally obtained
from ATCC. The LLC cell line was established from the lung of a C57BL mouse
bearing a tumor. B16 melanoma is a common cell line that naturally originated in
melanin-producing epithelia of C57BL mice. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Biological Industries, IL) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biological Industries, IL), 2 mM L-glutamine (Bio-
logical Industries, IL), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Biological Industries, IL), and 1%
PenStrep (Biological Industries, IL). The cells have been tested and found negative
for mycoplasma. Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5%
CO2 at 37 °C.

 mouse; 0.25×106 cells/mouse, respectively) by a researcher blinded to the experi-
ment conditions. The cells from both lines were injected to the lower right flank of
the mice in a total volume of 250 μl. The mice were then given a daily intraper-
itoneal injection of CNO (Sigma) diluted 1 mg/kg in saline. Control mice were
similarly injected with CNO.
Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry. Validation of the virus injection
site, evaluation of DREADDs expression, c-Fos analysis, and assessment of TH+
neurons in the bone marrow were performed by immunohistochemistry. Mice
were sacrificed, and their brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS
for 48 h, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution for another 48 h, and then frozen in
dry ice. Coronal cryosections from the midbrain were sliced at 12 μm thickness and
mounted on super-frost slides (Fisherbrand). The tissues were stained for TH with
mouse anti-TH (1:200; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and the proportion of
DREADD-expressing cells (mCherry+) out of the total TH+ population in the
VTA was evaluated (min 1500 cells). To evaluate c-Fos expression, the mice were
sacrificed 90 min after CNO injection, and treated as described above. The fixed
sections were prepared and stained with rabbit anti-c-Fos antibodies (1:100, Cal-
biochem, San Diego, CA, USA). The proportion of c-Fos+ cell nuclei was calcu-
lated from the total number of virus-expressing cells. Quantification of double-
positive cells was performed using Imaris Software. For the evaluation of the TH+
neurons in the bone marrow, the mice were sacrificed, and the hind legs were fixed
in 4% PFA in PBS for 48 h, and then decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA in PBS for 10 days.
Afterwards, the bones were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution for another 48 h
and then frozen in dry ice. Cryosections from the bone were sliced at 10 μm
thickness and mounted on super-frost slides (Fisherbrand). The tissues were
stained for TH with mouse anti-TH (1:200; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and the
TH positive neurons were quantified using Fiji software (expressed as area per-
centage). All images were taken at 20× or 10× magnification using an Axio imager
M2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc. US).
Analysis of NA and corticosterone levels. For the analysis of NA and corti-
costerone levels in plasma samples, whole blood from anesthetized mice were
collected in heparinized tubes. Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 2000×g and
stored at −80 °C until analyzed. To analyze NA levels in the bone marrow, mouse
femurs and tibias were flushed with 2 ml of cold PBS and centrifuged for 10 min at
300×g. Supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C. To analyze the NA levels
in the spleen and tumor, 0.7 g of each sample was homogenized using Bullet
Blender (Next Advance, US) in 700 μl of PBS containing 0.01 N HCl, 1 mM EDTA,
and 4 mM sodium metabisulfite. NA levels in the plasma, spleen, tumor, and bone
marrow sample were analyzed with Norepinephrine ELISA kit (IBL-America, US).
Plasma corticosterone levels were analyzed with Corticosterone ELISA kit (Enzo
Life Sciences, US).
Flow cytometry. Mice were sacrificed, and their bone marrows, spleens, and
tumors were collected. Spleens were dissociated into single-cell suspensions in 2%
FBS in PBS (Biological Industries, IL) and mesh-filtered to remove clumps and
debris. Tumor tissues were dissociated into single-cell suspensions in 2% FBS
(Biological Industries, IL) and 1 mM EDTA in PBS, and mesh-filtered to remove
clumps and debris. Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing mouse femurs and
tibias with PBS. Cell suspensions were treated with red blood cell lysis buffer (BD
Biosciences, NJ, USA). For extracellular staining, cells (106) were incubated with
antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, cells were washed with FACS staining buffer
(PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% sodium azide). The fol-
lowing mAbs (all from Biolegend, San Diego, CA, US) were used: PerCP-
conjugated anti-CD11b (M1/70), PE-Cy7 or PE-conjugated anti-Ly-6G/Ly-6C (Gr-
1;RB6-8C5), PE or Alexa Flour 700-conjugated anti-CD45 (30-F11), Brilliant
Violet 510-conjugated anti-Ly6C (HK1.4), FITC or APC-conjugated anti-Ly6G
(1A8), PE-conjugated anti-TNF-α (MP6-XT22), APC-conjugated anti-Arginase
(R&D Systems), APC-conjugated anti-PDL-1 (10F.9G2), Alexa Flour 647-
conjugated anti-IDO-1 (2E2/IDO1), and Alexa Flour 405-conjugated anti-iNOS
(Santa Cruz). For intracellular staining, the samples were first stained extracellular
as described above, fixated and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit, and
stained with the intracellular antibodies. The samples were re-suspended in 400 μl
of 1% PFA and analyzed by flow cytometry. All samples were analyzed using an
LSRFortessa cell analyzer and FlowJo software.
Sympathetic denervation. As described before15, virus-injected mice (30 days
after stereotactic injection) were sympathetically denervated by two intraperitoneal
injections of 6OHDA (150 mg/kg in 0.01% ascorbic acid in saline; Sigma–Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) administered at 24 h intervals. Mice were injected s.c. with
LLC tumor cells in the lower right flank (0.5×106 cells/mouse) 5 days after the last
6OHDA injection. The mice were injected daily with the DREADD ligand, CNO,
for 14 days, and afterwards the immune organs and tumors were removed for
analysis.
Nadolol and anti Gr-1 treatment. Virus-injected mice (30 days after stereotactic
injection) were injected with tumor cells. Then, we injected ip either Nadolol (6
mg/kg in saline; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or anti-Gr-1 antibody (200
μg/mouse in saline; BioXcell) or an isotype control antibody (200 μg/kg in saline;
BioXcell). The anti Gr-1 antibody, its isotype control as well as the Nadolol and its
vehicle control, were all injected daily 20 min before the CNO injections. After
14 days, the mice were sacrificed and their tumors were analyzed.
p-CREB analysis. Cells from the bone marrow of tumor bearing mice were
extracted by flushing femurs and tibias with 2 ml cold PBS. Then, the cells were
centrifuged for 10 min at 300×g, and the pellets were re-suspended at a con-
centration of 5 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries IL) sup-
plemented with heat inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries IL), L-
glutamine (200 mM; Biological Industries IL), sodium pyruvate (100 nM; Biological
Industries IL), and Penicillin–Streptomycin solution (diluted 1:100; Biological
Industries IL). Bone marrow cells extracted from each mouse were divided into two
24-well plates. Into one of the wells, the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, was
added at a concentration of 1 μM for 15 min. After that, the cells were fixed with
4% PFA (ThermoFisher scientific) for 15 min, and then centrifuged for 5 min at
300×g. The supernatants were discarded and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 1
ml 90% cold methanol for 20 min at 4 °C. Then, the cells were washed twice with
FACS staining buffer, and stained with PerCP-conjugated anti-CD11b, Brilliant
Violet 421-conjugated anti-Ly6C, PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-Ly-6G/Ly-6C (Gr-1),
and Alexa Flour 488-conjugated anti-phospho-CREB (Ser133; from Cell Signaling
Technology) for 1 h at room temperature. All samples were analyzed using an
LSRFortessa cell analyzer and FlowJo software.
Quantitative RT-PCR. For analyzing the effect of β-adrenergic stimulation on gene
expression, sorted MDSCs were incubated overnight (16 h) with isoproterenol
(1 μM) diluted in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with heat inactivated 10%
fetal calf serum, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and Penicillin–Streptomycin. Then
the cells were lysed in TRI-Reagent (Sigma) and stored at −80 °C overnight. Total
RNA was isolated according to the protocol supplied with the TRI-Reagent. Total
RNA (0.1 µg) was reverse transcribed (RT) using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR analysis was performed
using an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real Time PCR System (Foster City,
CA) in two independent experiments in duplicates using the Fast SYBR Green
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Dissociation analysis was performed at the end
of each run to confirm the specificity of the reaction. Real-time PCR efficiencies
were determined for all sets of primers used. The cycle conditions for real-time
PCR were 95 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s, and 60 °C for 30 s,
and a melt curve stage (95 °C 15 s, 60 °C 1 min, 95 °C 15 s). Quantification of
relative gene expression was performed according to the ΔΔ-CT method57 using
StepOne Software 2.3 (Applied Biosystems), and expressed as fold difference ± s.e.
m. For analyzing the effect of β-adrenergic stimulation on gene expression, the
same samples were used to monitor expression changes of five genes (VEGF, iNOS,
TGFβ, IL-10, and TNFα). For analyzing the effects of VTA-activation on gene
expression, the same samples were used to monitor the expression changes of the
gene CD31. To this end, we performed the Bonferroni multiple testing correction
with a cutoff P-value of 0.1.

In vitro T cell suppression assay. For all in vitro assays, CD4+ T cells were
obtained from spleens of naïve mice, and isolated using EasySep mouse CD4+ T
cell isolation kit (Stemcell Technologies Inc.). The T cells were labeled with CSFE
(Biolegend, San Diego, CA, US) to determine CD4 cell proliferation.
To assess the effects of noradrenergic signaling on bone marrow MDSCs, these
cells were isolated from the bone marrow (the site in which MDSCs expressed the
highest levels of mRNA for the β2-adrenergic receptor) of tumor bearing mice, by
staining and sorting for CD45+CD11b+Gr-1+ cells using a FACSaria. Isolated
MDSCs (1×105) were incubated for 1 h in 5 µM of isoproterenol (Sigma–Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted in RPMI media with 1% heat inactivated FBS
(Biological Industries, IL). The cells were then washed three times with fresh RMPI
medium, resuspended with the CFSE labeled CD4+ T cells (1×105), which were
stimulated with 1 µg/ml of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Biolegend, San
Diego, CA, US) diluted in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine

 serum (FBS; Biological Industries, IL), 2 mM L-glutamine (Biological Industries,
IL), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Biological Industries, IL), and 1% PenStrep (Biological
Industries, IL), and cultured in a U-shaped 96-well dish. After 96 h, T cells were
stained with APC-conjugated anti-CD4 (GK1.5) and analyzed with an LSRFortessa
cell analyzer and FlowJo software.
To evaluate the ability of MDSCs to suppress T-cell proliferation, we isolated
MDSCs from the tumors because in this site MDSCs manifest the highest
immunosuppressive capacity. The MDSCs were isolated from VTA-activated mice
and their controls (injected with a virus lacking the information encoding for
DREADDs). The cells were then stained for CD45+CD11b+Gr-1+ and sorted
using FACSaria. The isolated MDSCs (1×105) were resuspended in fresh RMPI
media (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biological Industries, IL),
2 mM L-glutamine (Biological Industries, IL), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Biological
Industries, IL), and 1% PenStrep (Biological Industries, IL)), and plated in a U-
shaped 96-well culture plates, along with CD4+ T cells (1×105). The T cells used
for the incubation were labeled with CFSE and stimulated with 1 µg/ml of anti-
CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, US). Following 96 h, we
stained the T cells with an APC-conjugated anti-CD4 (GK1.5) and analyzed the
cells with LSRFortessa cell analyzer. We identified proliferating CD4 T cells based
on their CFSE levels, which is reduced in proliferating cells. The percentage
suppression of proliferating CD4 T cells was calculated using the following

Anti�CD3þanti�CD28 stimulated CD4 T cells in the absence of MDSCs
CD11b+Gr-1+ MSDCs adoptive transfer assay. CD11b+GR1+ cells were isolated
using FACSaria from the tumors of VTA-activated mice and their controls
(injected with a virus lacking the information encoding for DREADDs). Isolated
MDSCs (2×105) were co-injected s.c. with 2×105 LLC cells, into naïve C57BL/6
mice. To physically bind the isolated MDSCs and LLC cells, these cells were
injected together with 200 µl of Cultrex gel (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, Maryland,
USA). Tumor weight was measured after 14 days.
Statistical analysis. Significance levels of other data were determined by using
Prism5 (GraphPad Software). Experiments were analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t-
test or by Mann–Whitney test to account for the multiple comparisons, as indi-
cated for each experiment.
