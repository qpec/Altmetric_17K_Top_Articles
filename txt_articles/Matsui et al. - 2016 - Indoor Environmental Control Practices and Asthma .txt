abstract
Indoor environmental exposures, particularly allergens and pollutants, are 
major contributors to asthma morbidity in children; environmental control 
practices aimed at reducing these exposures are an integral component 
of asthma management. Some individually tailored environmental 
control practices that have been shown to reduce asthma symptoms and 
exacerbations are similar in effi
 cacy and cost to controller medications. 
As a part of developing tailored strategies regarding environmental 
control measures, an environmental history can be obtained to evaluate 
the key indoor environmental exposures that are known to trigger 
asthma symptoms and exacerbations, including both indoor pollutants 
and allergens. An environmental history includes questions regarding 
the presence of pets or pests or evidence of pests in the home, as well as 
knowledge regarding whether the climatic characteristics in the community 
favor dust mites. In addition, the history focuses on sources of indoor air 
pollution, including the presence of smokers who live in the home or care 
for children and the use of gas stoves and appliances in the home. Serum 
allergen-specifi
 c immunoglobulin E antibody tests can be performed 
or the patient can be referred for allergy skin testing to identify indoor 
allergens that are most likely to be clinically relevant. Environmental control 
strategies are tailored to each potentially relevant indoor exposure and are 
based on knowledge of the sources and underlying characteristics of the 
exposure. Strategies include source removal, source control, and mitigation 
strategies, such as high-effi
 ciency particulate air purifi
 ers and allergen-
proof mattress and pillow encasements, as well as education, which can be 
delivered by primary care pediatricians, allergists, pediatric pulmonologists, 
other health care workers, or community health workers trained in asthma 
environmental control and asthma education.

INTRODUCTION
Asthma is one of the most common 
chronic childhood illnesses, affecting 
as many as 10% of children across the 
United States, with prevalence rates 
as high as 25% in some communities. 
1 
Self-reported black race, Puerto 
Rican ethnicity, and poverty are the 
major risk factors for asthma in US 
populations. 
1 Children with asthma 
who are sensitized and exposed 
to indoor allergens, including dust 
mite, 
 
2 rodent, 
 
3, 
4 cockroach, and pet 
allergens, 
 
5, 
 
6 have worse asthma 
control and lung function and greater 
airway inflammation and morbidity 
than those who are either not 
sensitized or not exposed to these 
allergens. In addition, exposure to 
common indoor pollutants, including 
secondhand smoke (SHS) 
7 and 
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 
 
8 exacerbates 
asthma, regardless of the presence of 
allergic sensitization.
Children may be vulnerable to these 
environmental exposures for several 
potential reasons. First, perhaps 
because of their airway physiology, 
they may be exposed to larger doses 
of airborne pollutants. 
9 
– 
11 Second, 
it is possible that their exposure to 
pollutants, chemicals, and/or allergens 
is greater because of their proximity to 
the floor, which can be a reservoir for 
these exposures. 
12 It is also noteworthy 
that most children with asthma who 
are at least school-aged have evidence 
of allergic sensitization, so that allergen 
exposure likely plays a significant 
role in childhood asthma. However, 
an estimated 20% of school-aged 
children with persistent asthma are 
not atopic, 
13 
– 
15 and although they are 
not susceptible to allergen exposure, 
they are susceptible to pollutants 
and irritants, as are children with 
atopic diseases. For all children with 
asthma, viruses are a major trigger of 
exacerbations.
The purpose of this report is to raise 
awareness among pediatricians 
regarding the need to assess for and 
implement indoor environmental 
control practice measures in 
the management of asthma and, 
thereof, to provide guidance. The 
recently published manual Pediatric 
Environmental Health, known as 
the “Green Book” (third edition, 
2012) from the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP), has 2 chapters 
devoted to the discussion of topics 
included in this report: chapter 20, 
“Air Pollutants, Indoor, 
” and chapter 
43, “Asthma.” 
16 These chapters 
provide additional reference material 
that supports a number of findings 
discussed in this report. There are 
no contradictions evident between 
the 2 resources, but the current 
report includes some updated 
references and commentary (eg, 
electronic nicotine delivery systems 
[e-cigarettes], practice parameters 
regarding environmental assessment 
of and exposure reduction to rodent 
and cockroach allergens, etc).
Environmental control strategies 
are tailored to each potentially 
relevant indoor exposure on the 
basis of knowledge of the patient’s 
allergic sensitivities and relevant 
indoor exposures. Serum allergen-
specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) 
antibody tests may be performed, 
or the patient may be referred to a 
board-certified allergist for allergy 
skin testing to identify indoor 
allergens that are most likely to be 
clinically relevant for a patient who 
meets National Asthma Education 
and Prevention Program criteria for 
persistent asthma, which include 
patients taking a long-term controller 
medication as well as patients 
having symptoms >2 days per week 
or nocturnal symptoms more than 
twice per month. 
17 Serum IgE testing 
and allergy skin testing are both 
appropriate methods of assessing 
allergic sensitivities; neither is clearly 
better than the other in identifying 
clinically important sensitizations, 
 
18 
and there is no lower age limit for 
either of these tests.
For allergic children, an 
environmental history includes 
questions regarding the presence of 
furry pets or pests or evidence of 
pests in the home. Understanding 
whether the climatic characteristics of 
a community favor dust mite growth is 
important for assessing the likelihood 
that the patient has significant 
exposure to dust mites. Except for 
arid climates, exposure to dust mites 
is an important consideration. For all 
children, both allergic and nonallergic, 
the environmental history focuses 
on nonallergen exposures as well. 
Allergens only affect a subset of those 
who are sensitized to the specific 
allergen(s), whereas irritants affect 
all children to variable degrees. 
For pollutants, the history focuses 
on sources of indoor air pollution, 
including smokers who live in the 
home or care for the child and the 
use of gas stoves and appliances. 
Household chemicals, such as those 
found in air fresheners and cleaning 
agents, also can be respiratory 
irritants and trigger asthma 
symptoms. 
16 The specific strategies 
used to target an exposure depend 
on knowledge about the sources 
and underlying characteristics of the 
exposure. Environmental control 
strategies include source removal 
(eradication of the allergen source), 
source control (controlling the 
population/amount of the allergen 
source), and mitigation strategies 
(reducing the amount of allergen 
in the air, dust, bedding, etc, that is 
produced by the source), such as 
using high-efficiency particulate 
air (HEPA) purifiers and allergen-
proof mattress/box spring and 
pillow encasements. Individually 
tailored, multifaceted environmental 
interventions are endorsed by 
the National Asthma Education 
and Prevention Program guidelines 
and may be similar in terms of 
efficacy to controller medications. 
9 
Although a multifaceted approach 
makes intuitive sense and reflects 
clinical practice, much of the 
foundational research has focused 
on single allergens; therefore, each 
allergen will be discussed individually 
in this report.

INDOOR ALLERGENS
Dust Mites
The major dust mite allergens are 
Der f 1 and Der p 1, from the 2 most 
common house dust mite species, 
Dermatophagoides farinae and 
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, 
respectively. Dust mites, microscopic 
members of the Arachnid class, are 
rare in arid environments, because 
they require moisture to survive; 
humid environments such as those 
found in the southeastern United 
States and along the coasts are most 
conducive to dust mite growth. In 
more humid climates, dust mites are 
found not only in homes but also in 
public places such as schools.
Dust mite allergen exposure has 
been repeatedly linked to worse 
asthma among those who are dust 
mite sensitized 
2; and many, but not 
all, studies indicate that effective 
reduction in dust mite allergen 
exposure improves asthma in this 
patient group. 
2, 
 
19 
–21 Approximately 
30% to 62% of children with 
persistent asthma are sensitized to 
dust mite allergens, 
 
2, 
 
22, 
 
23 and it is 
this population who are susceptible 
to the effects of dust mite allergen 
exposure. Unlike patients who may 
describe allergic reactions to furry 
pet exposure, patients who are 
allergic to dust mites are unable 
to identify dust mites, which are 
microscopic, as an allergic trigger. 
Therefore, the pediatrician can 
only rely on an understanding of 
whether the climatic conditions of 
the community are conducive to 
dust mite growth. As an alternative, 
a family can have a home dust 
sample tested for dust mite content 
with the use of a commercially 
available kit, although this test is not 
currently reimbursed by third-party 
payers.
Dust mite allergen exposure 
reduction strategies focus on source 
removal (ie, killing the dust mites) 
and/or removal of the allergen. 
Strategies that have been attempted 
include measures that target the bed, 
including frequent washing of all bed 
linens in hot water and the use of 
allergen-impermeable mattress and 
pillow encasements, and measures 
that target other allergen reservoirs, 
such as vacuuming, removal of carpet 
and stuffed toys from the bed, and 
application of acaricides or allergen-
denaturing agents. 
24 Applications of 
acaricides and allergen-denaturing 
agents are cumbersome and 
ineffective, sustained reduction in 
indoor relative humidity is difficult 
to achieve, and carpet removal is 
expensive and of unclear benefit. 
24 
There are also potential risks when 
applying chemicals to the indoor 
environment, and although these 
risks are small when the agents are 
handled according to instructions, 
they are an important consideration. 
More information about the risks 
of chemical agents, including 
pesticides, can be found in the AAP 
publication Pediatric Environmental 
Health. 
16 Because the major dust 
mite allergens are carried on larger 
particles (>10 μm), they quickly 
settle to dependent surfaces after 
disturbance of the reservoir. For this 
reason, air filtration is not likely to 
have any meaningful effect on dust 
mite allergen exposure. Because 
dust mites feed on shed human skin, 
which is abundant in the bed, first-
line approaches to reduce dust mite 
allergen exposure include washing 
of bed linens and the use of allergen-
impermeable mattress and pillow 
encasements, which can be highly 
effective in reducing dust mite 
allergen in the bed.
Although the most recent meta-
analysis of dust mite interventions 
concluded that dust mite 
interventions had no effect on 
asthma, this meta-analysis included 
studies whose interventions had little 
to no effect on dust mite exposure 
and whose populations may not 
have been dust mite allergic. 
25 In 
contrast, most of the studies in 
children who are very likely to have 
dust mite–driven asthma found that 
dust mite interventions that resulted 
in a substantial reduction in dust 
mite allergen levels had a beneficial 
clinical effect. For example, of the 
15 studies of bedding encasements 
in dust mite–sensitized children 
included in the meta-analysis, 14 
included assessments of dust mite 
allergen exposure, and 7 found at 
least an 80% reduction in dust mite 
allergen in the active intervention 
groups. Of these 7 studies, 5 
found that the active intervention 
group had improvements in 
asthma. 
21, 
 
24,

Cat and Dog Allergens
The most common furry pets found 
in homes are cats and dogs; the major 
dog allergen is Can f 1 and the major 
cat allergen is Fel d 1. Exposure to 
these allergens has been linked to 
worse asthma among pet-sensitized 
asthmatics, and approximately 25% 
to 65% of children with persistent 
asthma are sensitized to cat or dog 
allergens. 
2, 
 
3, 
 
22, 
 
23 When patients are 
asked about the presence of a pet in 
the home (or in other places where 
the child spends significant time), 
an affirmative response confirms 
significant exposure, but the absence 
of a pet does not ensure that the 
patient does not have clinically 
meaningful pet allergen exposure. 
It is also important to note that a 
child with clinically relevant pet 
sensitization may not have acute 
allergic symptoms with exposure, so 
that the absence of these symptoms 
does not rule out a role for the pet 
in the child’s asthma. Although 
pet allergens are found in higher 
concentrations in homes with pets, 
they are ubiquitous and detected 
in places such as schools, child care 
centers, and public transportation. 
Furry animal allergens adhere to 
clothing, walls, furniture, etc, and, in 
contrast to dust mite and cockroach 
allergens, are predominantly carried 
on smaller particles (<10–20 μm), 
so they remain airborne for long 
e3

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
periods of time. As a result, they are 
carried on clothing of people who 
have a cat or dog and are transferred 
to environments that do not contain 
a cat or dog. Indirect exposure to pet 
allergens through this mechanism 
can also cause asthma symptoms in 
sensitized children. For example, cat 
allergen brought into classrooms by 
students with cats has been linked to 
worsening of asthma in cat-sensitized 
classmates with asthma.5
Clinically significant reductions 
in animal allergen levels require 
source removal, or relocating the 
pet. 
30 Even after removing the pet 
from the home, it can take several 
months before significant reductions 
in allergen levels are observed, 
 
31 
so it is important that parents are 
counseled accordingly. In the only 
prospective (but nonrandomized) 
study of pet removal, asthma 
improved significantly and controller 
medication needs were reduced 
substantially in the group who 
removed the pet but not in the group 
who kept the pet. 
32 Because of the 
reluctance of patients to give up 
their pets, there have been several 
studies examining the efficacy of air 
filtration in reducing airborne pet 
allergen levels and improving asthma 
in sensitized patients. 
33– 
35 Overall, 
these studies have found that this 
approach is ineffective at improving 
asthma outcomes and, at best, only 
modestly reduces airborne allergen 
levels. A common patient question 
is whether certain dog breeds are 
“hypoallergenic.” A recent study 
found that homes with dogs believed 
to be hypoallergenic had levels of 
dog allergen similar to homes with 
dogs that were not considered to be 
hypoallergenic. 
36 The “Thanksgiving 
effect” refers to the phenomenon 
when cat-allergic asthma patients 
living with, and apparently 
tolerating, a cat go away to college 
in the fall and then return home for 
Thanksgiving and, on reexposure to 
the cat, develop significant asthma 
symptoms. 
37 Sustained animal 
allergen exposure as an attempt at 
inducing tolerance is unlikely to be 
effective, but pet removal is quite 
effective. 
32
Rodents
Rodent allergens have been 
recognized as a cause of occupational 
allergy and asthma for many 
decades but have only recently 
been recognized as an exacerbator 
of asthma in rodent-sensitized 
community populations. 
38 Mus 
m 1, the major mouse allergen, is 
found primarily on small particles, 
like other furred animal allergens, 
so it is readily airborne. 
39, 
 
40 It 
is found in virtually all inner-
city homes, particularly in the 
northeastern and Midwestern 
United States. 
41– 
43 Although 75% to 
80% of US homes have detectable 
mouse allergen, concentrations in 
inner-city homes are as much as 
1000-fold higher than those found 
in suburban homes. 
44, 
 
45 A report 
of any evidence of infestation, 
particularly from a patient living in 
an urban neighborhood, suggests 
that there are clinically significant 
levels of mouse allergen in the home. 
However, a report of absence of 
infestation is not a reassurance that 
there is not clinically significant 
exposure when the patient resides 
in an urban neighborhood. Mouse 
allergen exposure has repeatedly 
been linked to an increased risk of 
a range of markers of uncontrolled 
and more severe asthma among 
sensitized children. 
3, 
4, 
 
42, 
 
43
A substantial reduction in mouse 
allergen levels can be achieved with 
a professionally delivered integrated 
pest-management intervention that 
includes trap placement, sealing 
of holes and cracks that can serve 
as entry points into the home, and 
application of rodenticide. 
46 It is 
important to weigh the potential 
benefits of rodenticide against the 
potential risks, and a discussion of 
these risks can be found in Pediatric 
Environmental Health. 
16 Although 
a minor mouse infestation can be 
handled without rodenticide, some 
homes with serious infestation 
may require a rodenticide; in this 
circumstance, bait blocks may be 
associated with the risk of accidental 
ingestion by children and pets, 
and families may have greater 
benefit from professionally applied 
rodenticide.
Although there has yet to be a 
study testing the clinical efficacy 
of intervention on mouse allergen, 
mouse-sensitized patients who 
have any evidence of infestation 
may benefit from integrated pest 
management, because reducing 
mouse allergen would be expected 
to be clinically efficacious. Integrated 
pest management targets mice and 
other pests, such as cockroaches, 
and includes sealing up entry points 
for pests and removing sources of 
food, shelter, and water for pests 
by storing food in chew-proof 
containers, cleaning up immediately 
after eating, fixing leaky faucets and 
pipes, and taking the trash out on a 
regular basis. For patients living in 
rental units, families can work with 
landlords and/or property managers 
to address the infestation. Patients 
with mouse sensitization are very 
likely to be cat sensitized as well, 
so the acquisition of a cat may not 
be a prudent approach to mouse 
infestation. Rat allergen exposure 
is less common, because it is 
detected in approximately one-third 
of inner-city homes; so, although 
it is associated with worse 
asthma, a smaller proportion of 
children are affected by rat allergen 
exposure than mouse allergen 
exposure.
Rodents are also kept as pets, and 
the more common rodent pets are 
gerbils, guinea pigs, and hamsters. 
Rabbits and ferrets, which are not 
rodents, are also common furry 
pets. Exposure to these animals can 
contribute to worse asthma among 
patients who are sensitized.

Cockroach
The most common cockroaches in 
US inner cities are the German and 
American cockroaches; the major 
German cockroach allergens, Bla g 
1 and Bla g 2, are the best studied in 
terms of health effects. Cockroach 
allergen exposure among sensitized 
inner-city children with asthma was 
first linked to asthma morbidity in 
the National Cooperative Inner-City 
Asthma Study report published 
in 1997. 
47 Since then, the link 
with asthma morbidity has been 
replicated, and highly effective 
methods based on integrated pest-
management principles to reduce 
cockroach allergen levels have been 
identified. Pesticides that come in 
gel form are preferred to aerosolized 
pesticides, which likely result in 
greater pesticide exposure. 
48, 
 
49 
Moreover, in a successful 
multifaceted environmental 
intervention in inner-city children 
with asthma, the degree of reduction 
in cockroach allergen was correlated 
with the degree of improvement in 
asthma symptoms, providing support 
for cockroach allergen environmental 
control measures, which include 
integrated pest management, as an 
integral part of asthma management 
in cockroach-sensitized children with 
asthma. 
19, 
50
Dampness and Mold
Excessive moisture in homes can 
contribute to asthma through an 
increase in mold exposure as well as 
increased cockroach and dust mite 
allergen. Excessive moisture may 
be present because of inadequate 
ventilation or other building 
problems or because of a flooding 
event. Mold exposure occurs mainly 
as spores become aerosolized, and a 
substantial number of asthma cases 
may be attributed to dampness and 
mold exposure. 
51 The prevalence of 
mold sensitization in children with 
persistent asthma is approximately 
50%, and the most common species 
to which children are sensitized and 
exposed are Alternaria, Aspergillus, 
Cladosporium, and Penicillium. 
52 
Although Alternaria and Aspergillus 
are derived from outdoor sources, 
they are present indoors and may 
be clinically relevant. 
53 The National 
Survey of Lead and Allergens in 
Housing found that 56% of homes 
had levels of some molds above 
thresholds observed to be associated 
with asthma symptoms. 
54 Children 
sensitized and exposed to the major 
indoor molds appear to be at greater 
risk of asthma exacerbations.52 
Remediation of mold has been shown 
to reduce symptoms and medication 
use in several populations, and its 
effects may not depend on whether 
the population is sensitized to 
mold. 
55, 
 
56
The evaluation of a patient with 
persistent asthma includes an 
assessment of sensitization to the 
major indoor molds, which can 
be accomplished with specific 
IgE testing performed on a blood 
sample or through referral to a 
board-certified allergist for skin 
testing. Air sampling, thermography, 
moisture meters, environmental 
history, and direct observation are 
all useful techniques to identify 
moisture problems. Although 
more sophisticated techniques for 
assessing home dampness and mold 
exposure are ideal, parental report of 
dampness, leaks, or mold is helpful 
and, in a child with sensitization to 
the major indoor molds, suggests 
that the parents be counseled to 
intervene on the home environment 
(some simple measures are listed 
in the Supplemental Appendix). A 
common tool used to assess home 
mold exposure is air sampling, but 
it is important to note that molds 
are ubiquitous, so reports from air 
sampling are uninterpretable without 
concomitant indoor and outdoor 
sampling. More detailed information 
about dampness and mold can be 
found in the Institute of Medicine’s 
report Damp Indoor Spaces and 
Health 
57 and the World Health 
Organization’s Guidelines for Indoor 
Air Quality: Dampness and Mould. 
58
INDOOR POLLUTANTS
Particulate Matter and SHS 
Exposure
Particulate matter (PM) simply 
means airborne particles, and it 
is often expressed as either PM2.5, 
which is the portion of PM that is 
2.5 μm in diameter or less, or PM10, 
which is the portion of PM that is 
10 μm or less. Both allergic and 
nonallergic children with asthma are 
susceptible to the effects of indoor 
PM and SHS. 
59 PM2.5, also known as 
fine PM, penetrates further into the 
airways than larger-sized particles 
and is capable of entering the alveoli. 
Indoor PM is composed partly of 
outdoor PM but mostly of particles 
generated indoors by smoking and 
other activities, such as cooking 
and sweeping. 
60 
 
–63 PM exposure is 
associated with lung inflammation, 
decreased lung function, and 
respiratory symptoms in children 
with asthma, regardless of whether 
they have allergic sensitization. Other 
sources of indoor PM include wood-
burning stoves, fireplaces, biomass 
burning, electronic nicotine delivery 
systems (e-cigarettes), 
 
64 cigar 
smoke, incense, bus idling outside of 
school, and other substances that are 
smoked, such as marijuana. 
16
SHS
Cigarette smoke is a major 
contributor to indoor PM in US 
homes, because each half-pack of 
cigarettes smoked in the home is 
estimated to contribute 4.0 μg/m3 of 
PM, 
7, 
 
60 and approximately 30% of all 
US children and 40% to 60% of US 
children in low-income households 
are exposed to SHS in their 
homes. 
7, 
 
65, 
66 Smoking cessation by 
close family members and caregivers 
is the most effective way to reduce or 
eliminate tobacco smoke exposure. 
Although tobacco dependence 
can be a very severe addiction, 
e5

Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
tobacco-dependence treatment 
medications approved by the US 
Food and Drug Administration are 
very effective in treating tobacco 
dependence and allowing the 
tobacco smoker to stop smoking. 
67 
State-of-the-art approaches to 
treating tobacco dependence initiate 
therapy on the basis of severity 
of the tobacco dependence and 
adjust therapy to control nicotine 
withdrawal symptoms. The AAP 
Section on Tobacco Control recently 
published documents that address 
clinical practice policy as well as 
public policy to protect children from 
tobacco, nicotine, and tobacco smoke 
and provided an accompanying 
technical report to support evidence-
based approaches. 
68 
– 
70
If tobacco-dependent family 
members are not ready to stop 
smoking or initiate tobacco-
dependence treatment, smoke-free 
home and car policies can reduce 
but not eliminate a child’s tobacco 
smoke exposure. For families 
who are not willing to consider 
smoking cessation, starting tobacco-
dependence treatment, or keeping 
the home smoke free, 2 randomized 
controlled trials suggest that the use 
of portable HEPA purifiers in the 
home may be of some benefit 
7, 
 
71 
but would not be as effective as 
if occupants of the home stopped 
smoking or instituted a home 
smoking ban. HEPA purifiers are also 
costly, so whether the expenditure is 
worth the benefit will vary depending 
on the child’s clinical picture, 
progress in smoking cessation or 
institution of a home smoking ban, 
and the financial resources available. 
It is also important to note that 
homes are not the only indoor spaces 
where children are exposed to SHS. 
SHS exposure in public places has 
been targeted by legislation that 
bans smoking in public places, and 
this legislation has been associated 
with significant decreases in asthma 
morbidity in children, including 
asthma hospitalizations. 
72
Portable HEPA Purifi
 ers
The use of portable HEPA purifiers 
has been shown to reduce indoor 
PM concentrations by approximately 
25% to 50% and to reduce asthma 
symptoms and exacerbations. 
7, 
 
71 
Portable HEPA purifiers appear to be 
effective in reducing PM from tobacco 
and nontobacco smoke sources, but 
there is little evidence to support 
their efficacy in reducing airborne 
animal allergens or pollen. Although 
HEPA purifiers are expected to be 
much less effective than the first-line 
approach of source removal, if they 
are suggested, nonionizing HEPA 
purifiers with clean air delivery 
rates that are appropriate for the 
size of the room in which they will 
be used may be most effective. This 
information is indicated on the air 
purifier packaging. It is important 
to note that cigarette smoke also 
produces nonparticle, gaseous 
pollutants, such as nicotine and 
others, and that HEPA purifiers do 
not appear to have any effect on air 
nicotine and possibly other gaseous 
components of tobacco smoke. 
7 As a 
result, HEPA purifiers will not offer 
any protection from the adverse 
health effects of these nonparticle 
components of SHS.
NO2
NO2 is a gas that is a byproduct of 
combustion, so it is found outdoors 
as a result of traffic and other 
combustion activities, and affects 
both allergic and nonallergic children 
with asthma. 
73 It can be found in 
concentrations associated with 
adverse health effects in homes, 
where the most important source is 
gas heat and appliances. 
8, 
 
73 
In addition, older wood-burning 
stoves, unvented space heaters, and 
other sources of combustion can 
produce NO2 and other pollutants. 
Higher indoor NO2 concentrations 
have been linked to worse asthma 
in children with asthma, 
 
8 although 
1 study found that only nonatopic 
children with asthma were affected.73 
Although data are scant regarding 
effective interventions for reducing 
indoor NO2, ensuring that the stove 
is properly vented and using the 
vent while the stove is in use would 
be expected to reduce indoor NO2 
concentrations. One randomized 
controlled trial found reductions 
of 40% to 50% in indoor NO2 
concentrations when a gas stove 
was replaced with an electric one. 
74 
Whether this degree of indoor NO2 
reduction results in improvements in 
asthma remains unclear, however.
ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION AND 
MANAGEMENT FOR THE PEDIATRIC 
PATIENT WITH ASTHMA
An assessment of environmental 
triggers and education regarding 
evidence-based approaches to 
exposure reduction are an integral 
part of asthma management in 
the pediatric patient. 
75 Children 
are vulnerable to the respiratory 
effects of indoor environmental 
exposures because of their 
respiratory physiology and because 
any pulmonary effects from 
these exposures may affect their 
respiratory health in adulthood. An 
assessment of allergic sensitization 
to a panel of indoor allergens is 
useful for determining whether 
indoor allergens may be clinically 
relevant for a patient and, if so, for 
identifying which allergens may be 
relevant. Allergen-specific IgE tests 
can be performed at commercial 
laboratories, so they can be ordered 
by a primary care provider. Testing 
to large panels of allergens is not 
helpful, because there may be many 
positive results to allergens that 
are not relevant to the individual 
patient’s environment and history; 
instead, testing to selected relevant 
allergens is preferred. The clinical 
scenario guides which allergens 
to include in testing; for pediatric 
patients with persistent asthma, 
testing to common indoor allergens, 
including cat, dog, dust mites (if in 
a nonarid area of the country), and

molds, is appropriate. For children 
living in a community in which pest 
infestation is common, testing for 
mouse and cockroach sensitization 
would also be appropriate. More 
information about allergy testing 
can be found in a recent AAP clinical 
report on the subject. 
18 Alternatively, 
the patient can be referred to an 
allergist-immunologist for allergy 
skin testing, interpretation of results, 
and education of the family about 
environmental triggers.
In most cases, a careful exposure 
history, combined with knowledge 
about the community and allergy 
testing, is sufficient to identify 
the major exposures that may be 
clinically relevant. The history 
includes asking parents and patients 
about exposure to pets, dampness, 
or mold and whether they have seen 
evidence of pest infestation. Relevant 
exposures occur at schools, child 
care centers, cars/transportation, 
and relatives’ homes, so these other 
locations of potential exposure 
are included in the environmental 
history. Understanding whether the 
patient lives in an area conducive 
to dust mite growth or to mouse 
or cockroach infestation is also an 
important component of determining 
the potentially relevant allergens for 
the patient. For pollutants, which 
are relevant for both allergic and 
nonallergic children with asthma, the 
history includes asking parents and 
patients first about SHS exposure. An 
additional history elicits the presence 
of gas heat and/or appliances, 
because this finding would suggest 
that the patient may have clinically 
relevant NO2 exposure. Because 
relevant exposures occur in schools 
and child care centers, it is important 
to elicit potential relevant exposures 
that occur in other settings outside 
of the home. Often, families can work 
with schools and child care centers 
to address relevant exposures, and 
both the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention have online 
resources for addressing the school 
environment (http://

gov/ 
iaq/ 
schools/ 
managingasthma. 
html and http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
HealthyYouth/ 
asthma/ 
creatingafs/ 
, 
respectively).
The environmental history and 
assessment of allergic sensitization 
will inform a tailored environmental 
control plan for the patient. It is 
important to note that environmental 
interventions that target all relevant 
exposures are more likely to be 
successful than those that target 
only 1 or 2 exposures. For patients 
sensitized to an allergen, the first-
line strategies for targeting indoor 
exposures discussed previously 
are likely to result in a reduction 
in relevant indoor exposures and 
improvements in asthma. Although 
the role of allergen-proof mattress 
and pillow encasements has been 
debated, 
 
76, 
 
77 their efficacy may 
be greater for children than for 
adults, 
 
20, 
 
21, 
26 
– 
28 and they have been 
an integral part of successful, 
individually tailored, multifaceted 
home environmental interventions. 
19 
For patients with SHS exposure, 
helping the smoker obtain effective 
tobacco-dependence treatment so 
that he or she can stop smoking is the 
most effective approach, because it 
eliminates the source of the tobacco 
smoke. A home smoking ban can 
reduce, but does not eliminate, the 
tobacco smoke exposure. In some 
cases, the parent may not be able to 
influence the smoking behavior of 
household members and may not 
be able to move to another home. 
In that situation, the use of portable 
HEPA purifiers may be better than 
no intervention. Insurance coverage 
for air purifiers and other goods and 
services for environmental control is 
being reevaluated and may be more 
widespread in the future. For patients 
with gas heat and appliances, the first-
line environmental control strategies 
would include ensuring that the gas 
stove is properly vented and the vent 
is used when the stove is on.
Because each child has his or her 
own profile of relevant exposures, 
it is important that the strategies 
regarding environmental control be 
tailored to each patient. In addition, 
each of the child’s exposures affects 
his or her asthma, so targeting 
all of the exposures, to the extent 
possible, is important to achieve 
the maximal benefit. A sample 
environmental control plan is 
provided (Supplemental Appendix), 
which can be used to indicate the 
child’s allergic status, to provide 
basic background information about 
indoor environmental exposures, 
and to list the environmental 
control practices that the family 
can implement to reduce the child’s 
exposure to indoor allergens and 
irritants that are contributing to the 
child’s asthma.
Although public and private 
insurers may cover environmental 
assessments and control measures, 
most do not, despite evidence of their 
cost-effectiveness. Public and private 
resources are available, including 
legal assistance (such as through 
medical-legal partnerships; www. 
medical- 
legalpartnerships 
. 
org), to 
help primary care pediatricians, 
asthma and allergy specialists, 
and patients with environmental 
remediation efforts pertinent to 
various residential settings. In some 
states, Medicaid may cover some 
components of an environmental 
intervention, such as a home visit 
for an environmental assessment 
and education, which can be 
delivered by health care workers or 
community health workers trained 
in asthma environmental control. It 
is important to note, however, that 
insurance coverage differs from state 
to state and among insurers and is 
expected to change over time, so it is 
best to seek information from your 
AAP Chapter, the AAP Department 
of Practice, or the Asthma and 
Allergy Foundation to understand 
what resources, including insurance 
coverage, are available to support

environmental control goods and

KEY POINTS
1. Individually tailored 
environmental control 
measures have been shown to 
reduce asthma symptoms and 
exacerbations, are similar in 
efficacy to controller medications, 
and appear to be cost-effective 
when the aim is to reduce days of 
symptoms and their associated 
costs. 
75, 
 
78 The efficacy of 
environmental control measures 
has been sustained for up to 1 
year after the intervention. 
19
2. As a part of developing 
tailored strategies regarding 
environmental control measures, 
an environmental history may 
be obtained to evaluate the key 
indoor environmental exposures 
that are known to trigger asthma 
symptoms and exacerbations, 
including both indoor pollutants 
and allergens.
3. The leading indoor environmental 
contributors to asthma symptoms 
are indoor allergens (pets, dust 
mites, mice, rats, cockroaches, 
molds) and pollutants (airborne 
PM, SHS, NO2).
4. An environmental history may 
include questions regarding 
the presence of pets or pests, 
or evidence of pests in the 
home, as well as knowledge 
regarding whether the climatic 
characteristics in the community 
favor dust mites. In addition, the 
history may focus on sources of 
indoor air pollution, including 
smokers in the home, use of 
gas stoves and appliances, and 
presence of mold in the home.
5. Serum allergen-specific IgE 
antibody tests may be performed 
or the patient may be referred 
to a board-certified allergist for 
evaluation and allergy skin testing 
to identify indoor allergens that 
are most likely to be clinically 
relevant.
6. Environmental control strategies 
are tailored to each potentially 
relevant indoor exposure and are 
based on knowledge of the sources 
and underlying characteristics of 
the exposure. Strategies include 
source removal, source control, 
and mitigation strategies.
