PSYCHOLOGY
Media exposure to mass violence events can fuel a cycle 
of distress
Rebecca R. Thompson1, Nickolas M. Jones1,2, E. Alison Holman3, Roxane Cohen Silver1,4*
The established link between trauma-related media exposure and distress may be cyclical: Distress can increase 
subsequent trauma-related media consumption that promotes increased distress to later events. We tested this 
hypothesis in a 3-year longitudinal study following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings and the 2016 Orlando 
Pulse nightclub massacre using a national U.S. sample (N = 4165). Data were collected shortly after the bombings, 
6 and 24 months post-bombings, and beginning 5 days after the Pulse nightclub massacre (approximately 1 year later; 
36 months post-bombings). Bombing-related media exposure predicted posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) 
6 months later; PTS predicted worry about future negative events 2 years after the bombings, which predicted 
increased media consumption and acute stress following the Pulse nightclub massacre 1 year later. Trauma-related 
media exposure perpetuates a cycle of high distress and media use.
INTRODUCTION
Countless mass violence events have stunned the world in recent 
years, including tragedies such as the massacre at the Pulse night-
club in Orlando, FL, and the mass shooting at a country music fes-
tival in Las Vegas, NV, each described at the time as the “worst mass 
shooting” in the history of the United States. Unfortunately, cover-
age of these and other large-scale collective traumas (e.g., terrorist 
attacks and disasters) appears in traditional and social media with 
increasing frequency; this extensive media coverage is often repeti-
tious and regularly includes graphic images and videos (1), as well 
as sensationalized descriptions of the events. Repeated exposure to 
news coverage of these events has been linked to poor mental health 
outcomes (e.g., acute stress) in the immediate aftermath (2–4) and 
posttraumatic stress responses and physical health problems over 
time (2, 5). The 24-hour news cycle and the proliferation of mobile 
technologies mean that much of the viewing public is regularly 
plugged into news updates. Thus, media coverage of collective, 
community-based traumas may transmit distress by broadcasting an 
event to whole populations, extending the reach of an event that 
would otherwise have been restricted to local communities (6).
Research also suggests that consumption of media coverage of 
collective traumas may be a rational response for individuals who 
are anxious about such events. The uncertainty management hy-
pothesis (7–9) states that individuals may experience anxiety result-
ing from feelings of uncertainty associated with collective traumas. 
To mitigate this anxiety and the uncertainty from which it stems, 
individuals who are concerned about a collective trauma may seek 
information from the media. Thus, individuals with increased event-related 
fear should be more likely to cope by consuming trauma-related 
media. Furthermore, this is likely to be true even for individuals 
without a history of mental health problems—even healthy individ-
uals pay greater attention to stimuli they perceive as threatening 
(10–12). However, this strategy of reducing uncertainty by seeking 
information via the media may backfire when individuals are ex-
posed to graphic trauma-related media content. For example, in 
the aftermath of the September 11th (9/11) terrorist attacks, indi-
viduals who perceived the media as a provider of useful informa-
tion were more likely to consume 9/11-related media coverage, 
but this media use was associated with increased distress over 
time (7).
Thus, an individual’s media use after a collective trauma may fuel 
a cycle of distress by exacerbating distress and worry about future 
events, which promotes even greater distress when these events ul-
timately occur. Worry about the future is commonly associated 
with posttraumatic stress (13, 14) and is a hallmark symptom of most 
anxiety disorders. Because worry about the future is associated with 
protective decision-making (15), to the extent that people consume 
media to gather information they can use to protect themselves from 
a perceived threat, previous worries about future events should be 
associated with future media use as well.
After a collective trauma, other individual-level characteristics 
and experiences may underpin psychological vulnerability and 
information-seeking behavior. Those who have experienced more 
violence in their lives often see themselves at greater risk of exposure 
to future negative events (16) and are more likely to develop mental 
health problems following subsequent violent and nonviolent trau-
mas (17). Individuals with previously diagnosed mental health ail-
ments are also more likely to report high distress and greater incidence 
of physical health ailments over time following community-based 
traumas (18, 19). Research also finds that individuals with past expo-
sure to collective traumas encounter more media coverage of subsequent 
collective traumas (1) and suggests that mental health may be impli-
cated in media exposure (1, 20). Thus, it may be the case that indi-
viduals with these characteristics and experiences may be at greater 
risk of falling into patterns of traumatic media exposure and dis-
tress in a trauma’s aftermath.
We hypothesize that distress responses to a past collective trau-
ma may sensitize individuals—that is, make them more emotionally 
responsive—to media coverage of future events, resulting in height-
ened distress and worry following subsequent media exposure. This 
heightened distress may also lead to increased attention to media 
coverage of future events. Although underexplored, there is some 
evidence for this cyclical pattern. Both direct and media-based indi-
rect exposures to past collective traumas are known risk factors for

future posttraumatic stress responses to subsequent trauma (2, 21, 22). 
For example, following the 2014 Ebola public health crisis, worry 
about contracting Ebola was strongest for individuals who reported 
both high distress about a prior trauma and greater exposure to 
Ebola-related media coverage (23). A cycle of sensitization may 
therefore exist such that individuals who consume extensive me-
dia about a collective trauma will respond more strongly both to 
that event and to future events as a function of their ongoing worry. 
This cycle has yet to be demonstrated, and a recent meta-analysis con-
firms that this remains a substantial gap in the literature. To this point, 
there have been no longitudinal studies examining the potential 
transactional effects of media use after a collective trauma (24). Such 
a study would “address the ways in which disaster media use affects 
reactions, how those reactions drive additional disaster media use, 
how additional media use affects future reactions, and so on” (24, p. 749). 
The present study aims to address this gap by demonstrating how 
these relationships play out over time in the context of exposure to 
consecutive collective traumas.
RESULTS
We conducted a longitudinal study of a national sample of U.S. res-
idents who were surveyed four times over a 3-year period, includ-
ing in the days following two mass violence events in the United 
States: the bombings at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon, 
which resulted in three deaths and over 260 people injured, and the 
2016 massacre in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL, which result-
ed in 49 deaths and 58 people injured. The first survey was fielded to 
a representative national sample 2 to 4 weeks following the Boston 
Marathon bombings and associated lockdown, and included over-
samples in New York and Boston metropolitan areas (wave 1, N = 
4675, 4/29/13 to 5/13/13, 79.1% participation) (3). The second 
survey was fielded to all available wave 1 participants (n = 4429) ap-
proximately 6 months later (wave 2, n = 3588, 10/17/13 to 11/17/13, 
80.9% participation). The third survey was fielded at around the 
second anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings (wave 3, 
n = 3341, 4/29/15 to 6/26/15, 78.1% participation) to all available 
wave 1 participants (N = 4276). The final survey was fielded starting 
5 days after the Pulse nightclub massacre (wave 4, n = 3199, 6/17/16 
to 7/22/16, 74.5% participation), again to all available participants 
(N = 4292). The present analyses included only those participants 
who completed at least two waves of data collection (N = 4165; 
89.1% of the original sample). The demographic characteristics of 
this sample and descriptive statistics for all variables of interest are 
presented in Table 1. This design enabled us to capture individuals’ 
responses to both events, a rare feature among post-disaster studies 
(25). As a result of this longitudinal design, we were also uniquely 
positioned to examine how post-event responses to one national 
trauma might sensitize people to news coverage of another tragedy 
over time.
Using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) Builder of Stata 
14.2 (College Station, TX), we examined the relationships among 
exposure to news coverage of both the Boston Marathon bombings 
and the Pulse nightclub massacre and acute and posttraumatic 
stress responses using path analysis. This analysis incorporates sev-
eral regression analyses simultaneously, which enables testing of 
possible causal pathways over time. Covariates included age, gen-
der, income, education (Bachelor’s degree or greater versus other), 
ethnicity (white, non-Hispanic versus other), and sample area (Boston

metropolitan area, New York City metropolitan area, or national 
sample).
Model specification was conducted using a complete case analy-
sis (n = 2450); the final model was fit using a full information max-
imum likelihood approach with bootstrapped SEs to account for 
multivariate nonnormality. In the initial theoretical model, previ-
ously diagnosed mental health ailments and prior history of vio-
lence exposure predicted both exposure to media coverage of the 
Boston Marathon bombings and bombing-related posttraumatic stress 
symptoms (PTS). Exposure to Boston Marathon–related media also 
predicted wave 2 PTS. Higher bombing-related symptoms pre-
dicted wave 3 worry about future events, which predicted wave 4 
consumption of Pulse nightclub–related media coverage and 
acute stress symptomatology. Stability paths were included for 
wave 1 and wave 4 media consumption, as well as for wave 2 and 
wave 4 symptoms. Pre–Boston Marathon bombings covariates 
(i.e., demographics and sample area) also predicted both bombing- 
related media exposure and PTS. This theoretical model fit the 
data satisfactorily [2(30) = 340.12, P < 0.001; CFI (Comparative Fit 
Index) = 0.90; RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation) 
= 0.065], but further analyses were pursued to attain a model with 
better fit for the data. Modification indices suggested an addi-
tional path between pre-bombing violence exposure and wave 3 
worry about future events [MI (Modification Index) = 57.62]; the 
addition of this path improved the model fit significantly [2(1) 
= 58.31, P < 0.001]. Further modification indices suggested an ad-
ditional path between wave 2 PTS and wave 4 media consumption 
(MI = 38.34); addition of this path also improved model fit rela-
tive to the more constrained model [2(1) = 38.29, P < 0.001]. 
Model fit indices suggested acceptable fit of this model to the data 
[2(28) = 243.52, P < 0.001; CFI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.056].
On the basis of this final model and theoretical considerations, a 
few additional paths were tested. The first was a path between prior 
mental health diagnoses and worry about future events. A likeli-
hood ratio test suggested that the addition of this path significantly 
improved model fit relative to the more constrained model and was 
included in the final model [2(1) = 14.79, P < 0.001]. The second 
path was between bombing-related media exposure and worry about 
future events. A likelihood ratio test suggested that the addition of this 
path did not significantly improve model fit [2(1) = 3.74, P = 0.053], 
and the indices of fit remained approximately the same (RMSEA = 
0.056; CFI = 0.94); thus, the more constrained model was chosen. 
However, there was a significant indirect relationship between Boston 
Marathon bombing–related media exposure and worry about future 
events through bombing-related PTS ( = 0.12, P < 0.001).
Figure 1 presents the best-fitting model for the data. Fit indices 
for this model indicated good fit [2(27) = 256.13, P < 0.001; CFI = 
0.941; RMSEA = 0.045]. Correlations for all variables may be found 
in Table 2; standardized regression coefficients for each of the struc-
tural paths that are not shown in Fig. 1 may be found in Table 3. 
Descriptions of tests of alternative models may be found in the 
Supplementary Materials.
We found that, controlling for covariates, media exposure to the 
Boston Marathon bombings was associated with PTS 6 months later, 
which, in turn, was associated with worry about future negative events 
at the second anniversary of the bombings. Bombing-related post-
traumatic stress and worry about future events each uniquely pre-
dicted both hours of media exposure and acute stress responses to 
the Pulse nightclub massacre. Pulse nightclub massacre–related acute 
stress symptoms were also uniquely associated with hours of media 
exposure to this event. Violence exposure that respondents reported 
experiencing before the Boston Marathon bombings indirectly 
predicted Pulse nightclub massacre–related acute stress through 
bombing-related media exposure, PTS, worry about future events, 
and Pulse nightclub massacre–related media exposure.
DISCUSSION
These results suggest that distress responses to past large-scale col-
lective traumas (e.g., terror attacks) may sensitize some individuals 
to media coverage of later collective tragedies, thereby exacerbating 
distress responses in their aftermath. In other words, this sensitization

process may fuel a cycle of distress. Our findings also suggest that 
exposure to repeated trauma-related media coverage may render 
some individuals more vulnerable to mental health consequences 
[e.g., flashbacks and intrusive memories; (26, 27)] as collective trau-
mas accumulate over time. Given the apparent role that worry about 
the future plays in perpetuating this cycle of sensitivity to distress, 
this cycle may contribute to a prolonged physiological stress re-
sponse that heightens risk for stress-related diseases (28, 29). Acute 
stress responses following a terror attack have also been associated 
with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease over time, even 
among individuals who were not directly exposed to the attack (30). 
Thus, this cycle of media exposure and distress appears to have 
downstream implications for public health. In a rapidly evolving 
news climate, the pressure to generate clicks and shares for online 
content can lead to sensationalism and, in some cases, can even fa-
cilitate the spread of unverified rumors (31), which are associated 
with even greater distress when information is scarce (32). Our 
findings suggest that media organizations should seek to balance

the sensationalistic aspects of their coverage (e.g., providing more 
informational accounts as opposed to lengthy descriptions of car-
nage) as they work to inform the public about breaking news events. 
This may reduce the impact of exposure to one event, reducing the 
likelihood of increased worry and media-seeking behavior over time.
Although we conducted prospective, longitudinal analyses, at-
trition across the 3 years of data collection suggests that the sample 
of individuals included in the present path model (i.e., those who 
completed at least two waves of data collection) was older, wealthier, 
more educated, and more likely to be white. We note, however, that 
wealthier, educated, white respondents also reported significantly 
lower Boston Marathon bombing–related PTS, and white respondents 
reported significantly less Boston Marathon bombing– 
related media 
exposure (see Table 3), suggesting the possibility that the pattern of 
findings reported here could be a conservative test of the hypothe-
sized downward spiral. That is, if people from other racial and ethnic 
backgrounds engaged more Boston Marathon bombing–related 
media, and reported significantly more PTS, then it is possible that 
our findings underestimate the strength of these associations in the 
general population. In addition, media use was assessed retrospec-
tively, albeit within a very short time frame after each event. Future 
research might ask respondents to complete daily reports of media 
use to obtain more accurate reports of their media exposure. Despite 
these limitations, longitudinal studies that capture repeated exposure 
to large-scale collective traumas among individuals drawn from a 
nationally representative panel are very rare, particularly when they 
include assessments of acute stress.
Our findings have important policy implications for both the 
news media and the general population. They suggest that social 
media platforms and other media organizations need to recognize 
the vital role they can play in broadcasting distress in the aftermath 
of mass violence events. Furthermore, there is some evidence that 
presentation of mass violence events in the media is associated with 
contagion effects, such that mass killings involving firearms appear 
to subsequently increase the rate of similar events in the future (33). 
Together with our findings, this suggests that a more even-handed 
approach when reporting these events is critical for public health. 
The sooner that news platforms begin monitoring themselves for 
potentially sensitive, graphic content, the better the outcomes for 
their consumers, who may not always be successful at monitoring 
their own media habits. Although a well-informed public is essential 
during crisis events, it is also important that viewers understand how 
they may be putting their long-term mental and physical health at risk 
by closely following along with collective traumas as they unfold in the 
news media. That way, consumers will be able to make more mindful 
and informed choices about how to stay informed about collective 
traumas across the world.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants were randomly drawn from the GfK KnowledgePanel, 
a nationally representative panel of U.S. residents recruited using 
address-based sampling methods. In address-based sampling, indi-
viduals are randomly sampled within households to participate on 
the panel through a series of mailings to randomly selected addresses; 
if a phone number is attached to an address, then phone invitations 
may also be used. KnowledgePanelists complete online surveys in 
exchange for internet access or other compensation (e.g., points that 
participants may accumulate that can be redeemed for cash, gift 
prizes, or sweepstakes opportunities). Households without computer 
access are supplied with a laptop to facilitate survey completion and 
ensure panel representativeness. Individuals may only join the 
KnowledgePanel after being randomly selected. Email, postcard, and 
telephone reminders were sent to encourage participation. All pro-
cedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the 
University of California, Irvine.
Before the start of the first survey, participants provided demo-
graphic information (e.g., age, ethnicity, gender, education, income, 
and region) and mental health history (physician-diagnosed depres-
sion or anxiety disorders, coded 0 for no diagnoses, 1 for either de-
pression or anxiety, and 2 for both diagnoses) upon entry to the GfK 
KnowledgePanel. Media exposure to the Boston Marathon bombings 
was assessed at wave 1; hours of exposure to each of seven sources of 
media (television; radio; pictures, videos, or text updates on social me-
dia; online news; and print media) were summed to create a composite 
media exposure variable. Cumulative hours of daily media consump-
tion were capped at 33 (3 SDs above the mean) to account for outliers 
(because individuals could report up to 11 hours per day across seven 
sources, many participants reported cumulative media use in ex-
cess of 24 hours per day across sources). At wave 2, participants’ 
complete life-event histories were assessed using an inventory of 37 
possible events that has been used previously in surveys of national 
samples (34). Participants indicated whether each event had oc-
curred before or following the Boston Marathon bombings; re-
sponses to the 12 violence items (e.g., being physically attacked or 
assaulted and being hit or pushed by partner/spouse) (16) that had 
occurred before the bombings were summed to create a composite 
score for prior violence exposure. PTS from the Boston Marathon 
bombings were assessed at wave 2 using a slightly modified version 
of the Primary Care PTSD Screen (35), which used four items to 
assess the hallmark constructs of PTSD (re-experiencing, avoidance, 
numbing, and hyperarousal) resulting from the Boston Mara-
thon bombings. Responses are scored on a 1-to-5 Likert-type scale 
(1 = never to 5 = all the time) and summed to create a composite 
Boston Marathon bombing–related posttraumatic stress score for 
each participant ( = 0.78). At wave 3, worry about future events 
was assessed using an eight-item scale that was adapted from one 
used in previous studies of collective traumas (36). Participants used 
a 1-to-5 Likert-type scale (1 = never to 5 = all the time) to report 
how often in the previous week they had fears of terrorism, com-
munity violence, natural disaster, or economic hardship affecting 
them or their families ( = 0.87). At wave 4, beginning 5 days 
after the Pulse nightclub massacre, acute stress symptomatology in 
response to the shooting was assessed using the Acute Stress Dis-
order Scale 5 (37). This scale measured the frequency of experienc-
ing 14 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th 
edition (DSM-5) (38) symptoms of acute stress resulting from “the 
Orlando mass shooting and its aftermath” on a five-point Likert-type 
scale (0 = not at all to 4 = a great deal;  = 0.88). Total hours of daily 
exposure to each of five sources of news media (i.e., television, radio, 
online news, pictures, and text on social media sources) regarding 
the Pulse nightclub massacre were also assessed at this time. Hours of 
daily media consumption were capped at 18 (3 SDs above the mean) 
to account for outliers. In addition to the data described here, pan-
elists completed two additional waves of data collection between 
waves 2 and 3 (Boston Marathon bombing anniversary wave: 4/18/2014 
to 5/6/14, n = 3260 responses, 74.2% participation; Ebola outbreak 
wave: 12/29/2014 to 2/27/15, n = 3450, 79.6% participation). The
