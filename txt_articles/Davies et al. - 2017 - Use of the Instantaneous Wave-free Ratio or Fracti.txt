BACKGROUND
Coronary revascularization guided by fractional flow reserve (FFR) is associated 
with better patient outcomes after the procedure than revascularization guided by 
angiography alone. It is unknown whether the instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR), 
an alternative measure that does not require the administration of adenosine, will 
offer benefits similar to those of FFR.
METHODS
We randomly assigned 2492 patients with coronary artery disease, in a 1:1 ratio, 
to undergo either iFR-guided or FFR-guided coronary revascularization. The primary 
end point was the 1-year risk of major adverse cardiac events, which were a compos-
ite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or unplanned revascu-
larization. The trial was designed to show the noninferiority of iFR to FFR, with a 
margin of 3.4 percentage points for the difference in risk.
RESULTS
At 1 year, the primary end point had occurred in 78 of 1148 patients (6.8%) in the 
iFR group and in 83 of 1182 patients (7.0%) in the FFR group (difference in risk, 
−0.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.3 to 1.8; P<0.001 for non-
inferiority; hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.33; P 
= 
0.78). The risk of each compo-
nent of the primary end point and of death from cardiovascular or noncardiovascular 
causes did not differ significantly between the groups. The number of patients who 
had adverse procedural symptoms and clinical signs was significantly lower in the 
iFR group than in the FFR group (39 patients [3.1%] vs. 385 patients [30.8%], 
P<0.001), and the median procedural time was significantly shorter (40.5 minutes 
vs. 45.0 minutes, P 
= 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS
Coronary revascularization guided by iFR was noninferior to revascularization guided 
by FFR with respect to the risk of major adverse cardiac events at 1 year. The rate 
of adverse procedural signs and symptoms was lower and the procedural time 
was shorter with iFR than with FFR. (Funded by Philips Volcano; DEFINE-FLAIR

F
or the past 20 years, physiological 
measurements obtained during invasive pro-
cedures have been used to guide coronary 
revascularization. Pioneering work supported the 
use of flow measurements to make safe deci-
sions about revascularization,1,2 but this approach 
was soon superseded by the use of fractional 
flow reserve (FFR), which measures pressure as 
a surrogate of flow to estimate the severity of 
stenosis.3-5 FFR was successful largely because of 
its technical simplicity and because clinical tri-
als showed that it was associated with improved 
clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI).6,7 Consequently, FFR is now 
included in the appropriate-use criteria for coro-
nary angiography and in the American College 
of Cardiology–American Heart Association–Euro-
pean Society of Cardiology guidelines; despite 
these recommendations, its adoption remains 
limited.8-10
FFR must be measured during maximal hyper-
emia, which is typically induced with the admin-
istration of a potent intravenous or intracoronary 
vasodilator, such as adenosine.11 Several studies 
have questioned the need for the administration 
of a vasodilator to assess stenosis severity.12-14 In 
these studies, investigators found that in deter-
mining stenosis severity, FFR was not superior to 
the instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR), a pres-
sure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not 
obtained with the administration of a vasodila-
tor. We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety 
of an iFR-guided strategy versus an FFR-guided 
strategy for coronary revascularization.
Methods
Trial Design and Management
DEFINE-FLAIR (Functional Lesion Assessment 
of Intermediate Stenosis to Guide Revascularisa-
tion) is a multicenter, international, randomized, 
blinded trial in which iFR is being compared with 
FFR for physiologically guided coronary revascu-
larization. The trial, which is ongoing, is being 
performed at 49 interventional sites across 19 
countries on 4 continents. The 1-year outcomes, on 
which the primary trial analysis is based, are re-
ported here.
The trial was designed by the steering com-
mittee (for a list of committee members, see the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org). Central ethics 
approval was granted by the National Research 
Ethics Service Committee London, and local eth-
ics approval was granted at each participating site. 
The trial is funded by an unrestricted educational 
grant from Philips Volcano, which had no role in 
the design of the trial, the collection or analysis of 
the data, the writing of the manuscript, or the 
decision to submit the manuscript for publication.
Trial management and oversight were per-
formed by personnel at the Imperial College Trials 
Unit, Imperial College London, who maintained 
the clinical database and conducted all the data 
analyses independent of the funder. A risk assess-
ment established that the trial was of low risk to 
the patients; therefore, no data and safety moni-
toring board was established. The first draft of 
the manuscript was written by the first author, 
and all the authors participated in trial oversight, 
approved all subsequent drafts of the manuscript, 
and made the decision to submit the manuscript 
for publication. The steering committee and all 
the authors vouch for the accuracy and complete-
ness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity 
of the study to the trial protocol and statistical 
analysis plan, which are available at NEJM.org.
Population
Patients who had undergone coronary angiogra-
phy were assessed for trial eligibility. Patients 
were eligible for inclusion in the trial if they had 
coronary artery disease with at least one native 
artery in which the stenosis was of questionable 
physiological severity (typically, an artery with 
40 to 70% stenosis of the diameter on visual 
assessment). Patients with tandem stenoses 
(i.e., stenoses separated by more than 10 mm 
within a single vessel) that would require inde-
pendent evaluation and treatment were excluded. 
A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is 
provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. No exclusions were made on the basis of 
heart rate or rhythm. Written informed consent 
was obtained from all the patients before their 
enrollment in the trial.
Randomization
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to un-
dergo revascularization guided by either FFR or 
iFR. Randomization was performed with the use 
of an automated and validated online randomiza-
tion tool (SRUB, Imperial College London). During 
the trial procedures, investigators were allowed 
 n engl j med nejm.org

Use of Instantaneous Wave-free Ratio in PCI
to obtain FFR or iFR measurements only in ac-
cordance with group assignment. Verification of 
the data was performed in each patient with the 
use of the electronic physiology record, which was 
uploaded directly from the physiological console 
for each patient into the electronic clinical record 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). During 
the procedure, patients were not told which tech-
nique was used for physiological assessment, and 
they remained unaware of their group assignment 
throughout the entire course of the trial. The re-
search nurses and doctors who were responsible 
for the follow-up visits were also unaware of the 
group assignments.
Procedure
Before the FFR or iFR measurement was obtained, 
intracoronary nitrates were administered to control 
vasomotor tone. The physiological measurements 
were obtained in the routine manner with the use 
of a coronary-pressure guidewire (Philips Volcano) 
(Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Physiological assessment was performed in 
all vessels with questionable stenosis severity. In 
patients with an acute coronary syndrome, phys-
iological assessment was performed in only non-
culprit vessels, after the culprit vessel had been 
revascularized. Prespecified treatment thresholds 
were an FFR of 0.80 and an iFR of 0.89 (Fig. S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix). When the FFR 
or iFR for a given stenosis was equal to or lower 
than the prespecified threshold, the stenosis was 
revascularized with a drug-eluting stent or a bio-
resorbable vascular scaffold or by coronary-artery 
bypass grafting (CABG). When the FFR or iFR was 
higher than the prespecified threshold, treatment 
was deferred. When multivessel revascularization 
was attempted, investigators could choose to pre-
specify a staged treatment plan, with the staged 
procedure performed within 60 days. Adverse pro-
cedural signs and symptoms were documented.
Routine clinical follow-up assessments were 
performed at 30 days and at 1 year, and follow-up 
by telephone was conducted at 6 months. Com-
plete monitoring of every electronic clinical record 
was performed, and the data were confirmed by 
on-site source-document verification in a randomly 
selected 30% of patients.
End Points
The primary end point was the 1-year risk of 
major adverse cardiac events, which were a com-
posite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, 
or unplanned revascularization. Death was con-
sidered to be from cardiovascular causes unless 
an unequivocal noncardiovascular cause was es-
tablished. Myocardial infarction was classified 
as either spontaneous or periprocedural and as 
either ST-segment elevation myocardial infarc-
tion (STEMI) or non-STEMI (NSTEMI). Revascu-
larization was considered to be unplanned when 
it was not the index procedure and was not identi-
fied at the time of the index procedure as a staged 
procedure to occur within 60 days. Detailed end-
point definitions, which did not change after the 
commencement of the trial, are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
End-point events were adjudicated with the use 
of anonymized source documentation by a com-
mittee of international experts who were not part 
of the steering committee. A consensus decision 
was made on the basis of prespecified end-point 
definitions. Members of the events committee re-
main unaware of the identities of the patients 
and their group assignments.
Statistical Analysis
The prespecified trial hypothesis was that iFR 
would be noninferior to FFR with respect to the 
risk of major adverse cardiac events at 1 year 
among patients undergoing physiologically guided 
revascularization. We based the sample size on 
an assumed annual rate of primary end-point 
events of 8.5% in a population that includes a 
mix of patients with either stable coronary disease 
or acute coronary syndromes15; given this rate, we 
calculated that a sample size of 2305 patients 
would provide the trial with 90% power to detect 
the noninferiority of iFR to FFR, with the use of 
a noninferiority margin of 3.4 percentage points 
for the difference in risk, at a type I error rate of 
5%. To allow for attrition, the target sample size 
was set at 2500 patients.
Both a risk-difference analysis and a time-to-
event analysis were performed. The time-to-event 
analysis was conducted with the use of the Kaplan–
Meier method. A Cox survival model was used 
to derive hazard ratios. For the results of both 
analyses, two-sided 95% confidence intervals 
(whose upper limits correspond to the upper limits 
of one-sided 97.5% confidence intervals) and two-
sided 99% confidence intervals (whose upper lim-
its correspond to the upper limits of one-sided 
99.5% confidence intervals) are reported. The va-

lidity of the proportional-hazards assumption 
was tested with Schoenfeld residuals. There were 
no signs of violation of the proportional-hazards 
assumption.
Patients who withdrew from the study before 
they reached 1 year of follow-up and who were 
event-free at their last visit were excluded from 
the risk-difference analysis for the primary end 
point and its components. Data for these patients 
were censored at the time of withdrawal for the 
time-to-event analysis. Patients who had a myocar-
dial infarction or an unplanned revascularization 
before withdrawing from the study were includ-
ed in the risk-difference analysis.
Results
Patients and Procedures
During the recruitment period (January 2014 to 
December 2015), a total of 2535 patients who un-
derwent coronary angiography were assessed for 
trial eligibility. Of the 2492 patients who met the 
enrollment criteria, 1242 were assigned to the 
iFR group and 1250 to the FFR group (Fig. 1). 
The baseline demographic characteristics of the 
patients are shown in Table 1. The mean age of 
the patients was 65 years, 76% were men, and 80% 
had stable coronary artery disease.
Procedural characteristics for the two trial 
groups are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2. A total 
of 99.4% of the patients assigned to the iFR group 
and 99.6% of those assigned to the FFR group 
underwent the assigned procedure. Crossover, 
which represented a deviation from the protocol, 
occurred in 13 cases and was due to profound 
early adenosine-induced bradycardia and hypo-
tension in 1 case and to site errors in the re-
maining 12 cases. There were no cases in which 
heart-rhythm disturbances or lack of electrocar-
diographic assessment prevented FFR or iFR mea-
surements from being obtained.
The number of vessels evaluated did not dif-
fer significantly between the iFR group and the 
FFR group (total number assessed, 1575 and 1608, 
respectively; mean [±SD] number evaluated per 
patient, 1.27±0.61 and 1.29±0.63; P 
= 
0.58). The 
mean iFR and FFR measurements were close to 
their respective thresholds (mean iFR, 0.91±0.09; 
mean FFR, 0.83±0.09); these findings suggest 
that most of the assessed vessels had stenosis of 
intermediate severity (Figs. S4 and S5 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). The number of function-

ally significant stenoses (i.e., stenoses with an 
iFR or FFR below the treatment threshold) was 
significantly lower in the iFR group than in the 
FFR group (451 vs. 557 [28.6% vs. 34.6% of total 
vessels evaluated], P 
= 
0.004).
In both the iFR group and the FFR group, the 
number of patients who underwent PCI (565 and 
625, respectively) was greater than the number 
who had functionally significant stenoses (426 and 
486, respectively). This is because PCI proce-
dures that were performed in culprit vessels of 
patients with an acute coronary syndrome and in 
angiographically significant stenoses (neither of 
which required physiological assessment) were 
included in the totals. The median procedure time 
was significantly shorter in the iFR group than 
in the FFR group (40.5 minutes [interquartile range, 
27.0 to 60.0] vs. 45.0 minutes [interquartile range, 
30.0 to 66.0], P 
= 
0.001).
Outcomes
At 1 year, the primary end point (a composite of 
major adverse cardiac events) had occurred in 78 
of 1148 patients (6.8%) in the iFR group and in 
83 of 1182 patients (7.0%) in the FFR group 
(Fig. 2). The hazard ratio was 0.95 (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.33; P 
= 
0.78), and 
the difference in risk was −0.2 percentage points 
(95% CI, −2.3 to 1.8; 99% CI, −2.9 to 2.5; 
P 
= 
0.83) (Table 3, and Table S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The upper limits of the two-
sided 95% and 99% confidence intervals were 
within the prespecified noninferiority margin of 
3.4 percentage points (P<0.001 for noninferiori-
ty). The risks of each individual component of 
the primary end point and of death from cardio-
vascular or noncardiovascular causes did not 
differ significantly between the two groups.

confirmed in the per-protocol analysis (Tables 
S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). In 
the per-protocol analysis, the hazard ratio for 
major adverse cardiac events was 0.94 (95% CI, 
0.67 to 1.31; P 
= 
0.72), and the difference in risk 
was −0.3 percentage points (95% CI, −2.4 to 1.8; 
99% CI, −3.0 to 2.4; P 
= 
0.77). The risk of each 
individual component of the composite end point 
did not differ significantly between the two groups 
in the per-protocol analyses.
Procedural Signs and Symptoms
In the iFR group, 39 patients (3.1%) reported ad-
verse procedural symptoms or signs, including 19 
who reported chest pain and 13 who reported 
dyspnea (Table 2). In the FFR group, 385 patients 
(30.8%) reported adverse procedural symptoms 
or signs, including 250 who reported dyspnea and 
90 who reported chest pain. The difference be-
tween the two groups in the number of patients 
with adverse procedural symptoms or signs was 
significant (P<0.001) (Fig. S9 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Serious adverse events (broncho-
spasm and ventricular arrhythmias) were reported 
in 8 patients in the FFR group (after hyperemia) 
and in 1 patient in the iFR group.
Discussion
In the DEFINE-FLAIR trial, we found that iFR-
guided coronary revascularization was noninfe-
rior to FFR-guided revascularization with respect 
to the risk of major adverse cardiac events. The 
use of iFR was also associated with a lower rate 
of procedural signs and symptoms and with a 
shorter procedural time than the use of FFR. There 
were no significant differences between the trial 
groups in the rates of death from any cause, 
death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, and unplanned revasculariza-
tion. These results suggest that the benefits of 
physiologically guided coronary revascularization 
with FFR can also be achieved with iFR. Our prin-
cipal findings are similar to those now reported in 
the Journal by Götberg et al.16
It has previously been proposed that a hybrid 
iFR–FFR approach might be advantageous for the 
detection of functionally significant stenoses, with 
iFR used as the initial measure and FFR used only 
to evaluate stenoses that were of intermediate 
severity on iFR-guided assessment.17,18 However, 
the results of our trial suggest that iFR alone can 
effectively identify stenoses that require inter-
vention. Our trial also provides clinical evidence 
that there is no significant advantage to the ad-
ministration of a hyperemic agent — a finding 
consistent with results of studies in which iFR 
and FFR were compared with other reference 
standards.13,14,19,20
Although evidence supporting the benefits of 
physiologically guided revascularization has ac-
cumulated over the past decade, adoption of this 
approach in clinical practice has lagged. There 
are many reasons for this, including equipment 
and drug costs, inadequate reimbursement, phy-
sician preferences, patient symptoms, and addi-
tional procedural burden. Although adenosine is 
a generally safe drug that is used in millions of 
diagnostic procedures annually, its risks are well 
documented21,22 and it is not suitable for every 
patient; therefore, avoiding the use of adenosine 
is preferable.11,23,24 In addition, adenosine contrib-
utes substantially to the cost of physiological 
stenosis assessment, and its use is hampered in 
many countries because it is unavailable or not 
indicated for this purpose. Thus, the ability to 
perform physiological assessments of coronary-

Use of Instantaneous Wave-free Ratio in PCI
artery stenoses without the use of adenosine may 
increase the use of such assessments in clinical 
practice.
Although the patients were not informed of 
their group assignments, adverse procedural symp-
toms or signs occurred in 30.8% of the patients 
in the FFR group, as compared with 3.1% of the 
patients in the iFR group. This difference is most 
likely due to the side effects of adenosine. It is 
therefore possible that at least some patients in 
the FFR group became aware of their group as-
signment. Such unblinding could have led to 
bias in the rates of unplanned revascularization, 
especially if patients discussed these symptoms 
with their physicians.
The number of functionally significant steno-
ses was lower in the iFR group than in the FFR 
group. This difference could be a consequence 
of dissimilar thresholds for the two measures. 
In addition, iFR has been shown to be more 
closely linked to coronary flow reserve than FFR, 
and a previous study has shown higher revascu-
larization rates associated with assessment guid-
ed by FFR than with assessment guided by coro-
nary flow reserve.25 Regardless of the explanation, 
the results of our trial suggest that the use of 
iFR can lead to outcomes similar to those asso-
ciated with FFR and to the placement of fewer 
(potentially unnecessary) stents.
The clinical population in our trial differed 
from the population in the FAME trial (Fractional 
Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel 
Evaluation), in which all the patients had multi-
vessel disease and were scheduled for revascular-
ization.6 In DEFINE-FLAIR, only 41% had multi-
vessel disease. Although the benefit of coronary 
revascularization in patients with single-vessel 
disease is likely to be more uncertain, our trial 
population is probably similar to the population 
that would be seen in current clinical practice. 
Given the clinical evidence in support of physi-
ologically guided revascularization, it was con-
sidered unethical to repeat a study similar to 
FAME, in which iFR-guided revascularization 
was compared with angiography-guided revas-
cularization.
In our trial, the noninferiority margin for the 
difference in risk was set at 3.4 percentage points, 
which meant that the upper limit of the hazard 
ratio could have been as high as 1.40 while still 
allowing a claim of noninferiority. Although this 
noninferiority margin is wide, it is similar to 
margins used in other major clinical trials in 
cardiology.26-32 The event rates were lower than 
had been expected, because the number of pa-
tients with an acute coronary syndrome who were 
enrolled in the trial was lower than had been an-
ticipated. However, when we used the prespecified 
noninferiority margin to test the actual event rate 
among the prespecified number of patients, we 
found that iFR was noninferior to FFR even 
when the upper limit of a one-sided 99.5% con-
fidence interval was used.
In conclusion, we found that coronary revas-
