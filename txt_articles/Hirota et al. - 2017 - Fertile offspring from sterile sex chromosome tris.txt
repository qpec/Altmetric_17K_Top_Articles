Having the correct number of chromosomes is vital for normal development and health. Sex
chromosome trisomy affects 0.1% of the human population and is associated with
infertility. We show that during reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs),
fibroblasts from sterile trisomic XXYand XYY mice lose the extra sex chromosome through a
phenomenon we term trisomy-biased chromosome loss (TCL). Resulting euploid XY iPSCs can
be differentiated into the male germ cell lineage and functional sperm that can be used in
intracytoplasmic sperm injection to produce chromosomally normal, fertile offspring. Sex
chromosome loss is comparatively infrequent during mouse XX and XY iPSC generation.TCL
also applies to other chromosomes, generating euploid iPSCs from cells of a Down syndrome
mouse model. It can also create euploid iPSCs from human trisomic patient fibroblasts.The
findings have relevance to overcoming infertility and other trisomic phenotypes.
T
he mammalian sex chromosomes have spe-
cialized roles in male (XY) and female (XX)
germ cell development (1). Sex chromosome
abnormalities are the most common genetic
cause of human infertility (2). In the sex
chromosome trisomies (SCTs) Klinefelter (XXY)
and double Y (XYY) syndrome, spermatogenesis
is disrupted by excess X and Y genes, respectively
(2). XYY men are commonly fertile due to spon-
taneous loss of the extra sex chromosome (mosa-
icism). In XXY men, mosaicism is less common.
Testicular sperm retrieval has enabled reproduc-
tion from some young Klinefelter men but is less
successful in older patients (3, 4). XXY and XYY
individuals without XY germ cells are infertile.
To study SCT infertility, we generated adult XXY
and XYY mice carrying the fluorescent reporter
transgenes Blimp1-mVenus (BV) and Stella-ECFP
(SC) (5) to monitor differentiation of pluripotent
stem cells into primordial germ cell–like cells
(PGCLCs) (6). XXY males were created by mat-
ing a wild-type female to a sex chromosome var-
iant male that produces XY-containing sperm
(fig. S1). Generation of XYY mice requires in-
heritance of a Y chromosome from both parents.
We therefore used a paternally inherited wild-
type Y chromosome and a maternally inherited
Yd1 chromosome that does not express the testis-
determinant Sry (fig. S1) (7). As shown previously
(8, 9), the spermatogenesis phenotype in both
models recapitulated that in SCT men, with arrest
at the prospermatogonial stage in XXY mice and
at pachynema in XYY mice (fig. S2). Spermato-
genesis was normal in euploid XY BVSC trans-
genic siblings.
Next, we established fibroblasts from SCT
and control XY and XX mice (Fig. 1A). DNA–
fluorescence in situ hybridization (DNA-FISH)
for the X gene Slx and Y gene Sly confirmed that
passage 4 (P4) SCT and control fibroblasts had re-
tained their original sex chromosome complements
(Fig. 1B andfig. S3A). Fibroblasts were reprogrammed
to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (10) in a
doxycycline (Dox)–inducible manner. DNA-FISH
was performed in resulting P2 iPSCs (Fig. 1A).
A high proportion of SCT-derived iPSC lines
exhibited sex chromosome loss. From XXY mice,
we observed XY, XX, and XO iPSCs (Fig. 1, C and
E). The incidence of loss was similar for the X
and Y chromosomes (P = 0.062, Mann-Whitney
test). From XYY mice, we observed XY and XO
iPSCs (Fig. 1, D and E). Y chromosome loss in

 XYY males occurred at a similar frequency to
that observed for the X and Y chromosome com-
bined in XXY males (P = 0.089, Mann-Whitney
test). We then compared the incidence of sex
chromosome loss between SCT-derived and eu-
ploid XY- and XX-derived iPSCs. Sex chromo-
some loss was more common in SCT- than
euploid-derived iPSCs (Fig. 1E), irrespective of
the cutoff used to define sex chromosome loss
(fig. S12D).
Sex chromosome loss could occur during re-
programming of SCT cells or during iPSC pro-
pagation to P2, perhaps conferring a proliferative
advantage to resulting euploid cells. Indeed, sex
chromosome instability has been observed in
pluripotent stem cells (11, 12). To test the latter
hypothesis, we analyzed sex chromosome stabil-
ity between P2 and P6 in iPSCs with highly pa-
rental (>90%) complements (fig. S4A). We observed
sex chromosome loss in XX and XXY iPSC lines
(P < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively; Wilcoxon signed-
rank test) but not in XY and XYY iPSC lines (P =
0.21 and 0.66, respectively; Wilcoxon signed-rank
test). However, no iPSC line showed more than a
15% decrease in parental complement (fig. S4B).
Furthermore, sex chromosome loss between P2
and P6 was not trisomy-biased (fig. S4B). SCT-
derived euploid XY iPSCs also exhibited no pro-
liferative advantage over XXY or XYY iPSCs (fig.
S5). Because SCT fibroblasts were also karyotypi-
cally stable (Fig. 1B and fig. S3A), chromosome
loss is likely induced during iPSC reprogram-
ming and is thus distinct from sex chromosome
instability in pluripotent stem cells (11, 12). We
refer to the phenomenon as trisomy-biased chro-
mosome loss (TCL).
We next determined whether euploid XY iPSCs
derived from SCT fibroblasts would form func-
tional sperm. We selected highly euploid (≥80%
of cells XY) P6 iPSCs adapted to Dox-free me-
dium (fig. S6). For our XYY experiments, only XY
iPSC lines that retained the wild-type Y rather
than the Yd1 chromosome were used for PGCLC
experiments (fig. S7). Karyotyping confirmed that
all SCT-derived XY iPSC lines and a control XY
iPSC line were euploid (fig. S8). These iPSC lines
were differentiated (6) through an epiblast-like
state to create PGCLC aggregates positive for BV
and SC (Fig. 2A). BV-positive PGCLCs (table S1)
were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sort-
ing (FACS) (Fig. 2B) and transplanted into germ-
cell deficient W/W v (Kit mutant) testes (13).
Spermatogenesis in recipients was evaluated
9 to 10 weeks after transplantation. Teratomas,
which are observed after iPSC-derived PGCLC
transplantation (6), were present in 29% of XXY-
derived and 50% of XYY-derived transplanted
lines (fig. S9). Reconstitution of spermatogenesis,
revealed by the presence of spermatogenic col-
onies (Fig. 2C) and by histology (Fig. 2D), was
observed for all XXY- and XYY-derived iPSC lines
used (Table 1). Thus, SCT-derived XY iPSCs can
differentiate to germ cells in vitro and complete
spermatogenesis after transplantation.
We asked whether sperm created via trans-
plantation could support reproduction. Intra-

Downloaded from 
 from two XXY- and two XYY-derived XY iPSC
lines (Fig. 2E and fig. S10A) generated zygotes
that developed into two-cell embryos in vitro
(efficiency 76.7 to 87.3%) (Fig. 2F, fig. S10B, and
table S2) and grossly normal offspring when
transplanted into recipients (efficiency 46.9 to
59.4%) (Fig. 2G, fig. S10C, and table S2). Poly-
merase chain reaction genotyping confirmed
that the offspring were derived from the trans-
planted PGCLCs (fig. S10D). Pups from XXY-
and XYY-derived iPSC lines showed comparable
growth to those derived from control XY iPSCs
(fig. S10E). Notably, the XXY- and XYY-derived
pups had euploid (XY or XX) complements (fig.
S11). Three matured males and three females
from each XXY- and XYY-derived iPSC line were
mated to each other, and all were fertile (Fig. 2H
and fig. S10F). Thus, sperm from SCT-derived XY
iPSCs give rise to chromosomally normal, healthy,
and fertile offspring.
We addressed whether TCL is specific to tri-
somy of sex chromosomes. Because mouse mod-
els with trisomy for a complete autosome are not
available (14), we repeated our experiments in male
Tc1 transchromosomic mice, a Down syndrome
model with an accessory human chromosome 21
(hChr.21) (15). Tc1 mice carry a hChr.21-inserted
neomycin resistance cassette, selection for which
reduces hChr.21 mosaicism (15). We therefore
first enriched adult Tc1 fibroblasts for the pres-
ence of hChr.21 using the neomycin analog G418
(Fig. 3A). DNA-FISH showed that the vast ma-
jority (≥96%) of Tc1 fibroblasts retained hChr.21
(Fig. 3B and fig. S3B). These Tc1 fibroblasts were
reprogrammed without G418 selection, and the
resulting iPSCs were analyzed at P2. Ten of the 16
iPSC lines that were generated (62.5%) showed
loss of hChr.21 in ≥10% of cells (Fig. 3, C and D, and
fig. S12D). In contrast, after G418 removal, hChr21
was retained in Tc1 fibroblasts cultured for the
same period as that used for iPSC reprogramming
(18 days) and in P6 iPSC lines that had highly
parental (>90% hChr.21 positive) complements at
P2 (fig. S12, A and B). We conclude that the loss
of hChr.21 in Tc1 cells is promoted by reprogram-
ming rather than G418 removal and therefore
that TCL also affects an accessory chromosome.
We next asked whether TCL occurs in human
cells. Instances of chromosome loss have been
observed during human trisomic cell culture
(16, 17), but its prevalence and relationship to
reprogramming has not been systematically an-
alyzed. We selected human Klinefelter syndrome,
Down syndrome, and euploid XY and XX fibro-
blast lines exhibiting minimal mosaicism (fig. S13,
A and D), reprogrammed them, and determined
the chromosome complements of resulting
iPSC lines. We observed XY and XX iPSCs from
Klinefelter syndrome fibroblasts and euploid
iPSCs from Down syndrome fibroblasts (fig. S13,
B,C,F,andG).Chromosomelosswasmorecommon
in trisomic than in disomic cells, demonstrating that
TCL also occurs during human reprogramming.
However, the frequency of highly euploid iPSC
lines was lower than that observed in trisomy-
derived mouse iPSCs (fig. S13, F to H).
We have shown that TCL produces euploid
iPSCs from SCT and autosomal trisomic mice
and patients (fig. S12E). In mice, the resulting
“corrected” iPSCs can form functional sperm,
enabling production of chromosomally euploid
offspring from infertile SCT individuals. TCL com-
plements existing iPSC therapies for chromosome
abnormalities (17–21). The mechanisms that cause
TCL are unknown. Cellular stresses associated
with reprogramming may select against trisomic
cells, permitting emergence of euploid cells. We
observed less frequent TCL in human than in
mouse cells (figs. S12D and S13H). Even if rare,
TCL could offer treatments for infertile SCT
patients for whom alternative approaches are
unsuccessful. However, the clinical use of human
germ cells made in vitro should be carefully con-
sidered ethically and legally (22–24). Furthermore,
complete in vitro spermatogenesis will have to be
developed to avoid the risk of teratoma forma-
tion arising through germ-cell transplantation.
TCL also permits production of female iPSCs
from males, offering potential for the genetic
dissection of sexual dimorphisms (25). By creat-
ing isogenic iPSC lines that differ only with re-
spect to their sex chromosomes, sex differences
identified during iPSC disease modeling could be
attributed to X or Y chromosomal effects.
