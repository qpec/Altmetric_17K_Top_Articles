ABSTRACT 
 
Clinically relevant subtypes exist for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), 
but molecular characterization is not yet standard in clinical care. We implemented 
a biopsy protocol to perform time-sensitive whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing for patients 
with advanced PDAC. Therapeutically relevant genomic alterations were identifi
 ed in 48% (34/71) and 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline alterations in 18% (13/71) of patients. Overall, 30% (21/71) 
of enrolled patients experienced a change in clinical management as a result of genomic data. Twenty-
six patients had germline and/or somatic alterations in DNA-damage repair genes, and 5 additional 
patients had mutational signatures of homologous recombination defi
 ciency but no identifi
 ed causal 
genomic alteration. Two patients had oncogenic in-frame  
BRAF deletions, and we report the fi
 rst 
clinical evidence that this alteration confers sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibition. Moreover, we 
identifi
 ed tumor/stroma gene expression signatures with clinical relevance. Collectively, these data 
demonstrate the feasibility and value of real-time genomic characterization of advanced PDAC. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: Molecular analyses of metastatic PDAC tumors are challenging due to the hetero-
geneous cellular composition of biopsy specimens and rapid progression of the disease. Using an 
integrated multidisciplinary biopsy program, we demonstrate that real-time genomic characterization 
of advanced PDAC can identify clinically relevant alterations that inform management of this diffi
 cult 
disease.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third-
leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and 
is projected to become the second leading cause by 2030 (1). 
Most patients present with advanced disease and die within 
12 months of diagnosis (2, 3). Recent genomic studies of 
primary PDAC resection specimens have identified recurrent 
molecular alterations and genomic subtypes of the disease 
(4–12). Moreover, RNA analyses of PDAC cohorts have identi-
fied gene expression signatures with prognostic and biologi-
cal relevance (7, 12–14). Although these molecular subtypes 
of PDAC may theoretically help guide precision medicine 
approaches, molecular characterization of PDAC in patients 
with advanced disease is not yet standard clinical practice. 
Biopsy-driven genomic studies have been challenging due 
to rapid disease progression and the small-volume and het-
erogeneous nature of biopsies that impede deep molecular 
characterization. Despite the fact that conventional therapies 
are often ineffective, the rate of enrollment of patients with 
PDAC onto clinical trials is extremely low (15). A proactive, 
standardized approach to acquire PDAC biopsy tissue and 
perform rapid turnaround molecular analysis is required 
to efficiently generate and utilize genomic information in 
patients with PDAC.
RESULTS
Biopsy Approach and Patient Cohort
The PancSeq protocol was developed as an institutional 
review board (IRB)–approved multidisciplinary biopsy pro-
gram to obtain tissue from core-needle biopsies or fine-needle 
aspirates in patients with metastatic or locally advanced 
PDAC for rapid turnaround genomic analysis. Between March 
2015 and June 2017, 79 patients underwent biopsy on the 
PancSeq protocol (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary 
Fig. S1). An initial pilot phase (n = 10 patients) was conducted 
in patients having clinically indicated biopsies to optimize 
workflow, tissue processing, nucleic acid extraction, whole- 
exome sequencing (WES), and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 
from small-volume needle biopsies (approximately 15–20 mg

of tissue per biopsy). Subsequently, 69 additional patients 
underwent biopsy and WES was performed in a Clinical Lab-
oratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–certified labora-
tory, with return of selected somatic and germline variants to 
referring clinicians. Patients had a median age of 64 years and 
most had metastatic disease (96%) and no prior therapy (70%; 
Supplementary Table S1). Most patients had a diagnosis of 
PDAC (95%), although several patients with less common 
histologies were enrolled. Biopsies were obtained from liver 
(n = 63), pancreas (n = 7), peritoneum (n = 6), lymph nodes 
(n = 2), and ovary (n = 1; Supplementary Table S2). Biopsies 
were performed percutaneously by interventional radiology 
(n = 72), with endoscopic ultrasound (n = 6), or intraopera-
tively (n = 1), and a median of 5 (range, 1–10) cores or biopsy 
specimens were collected per patient. A low rate of serious 
complications was observed, with only 1 patient having a 
self-limited hepatic subcapsular hematoma in the setting of a 
clinically indicated liver biopsy and therapeutic anticoagula-
tion with an oral factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban) for prior 
deep venous thrombosis.
Real-time DNA Sequencing and Exome Analysis
From the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded core, tumor 
content was quantified by histopathology, and 92% (73/79) 
of cases had sufficient tumor content (≥5% tumor nuclei) to 
proceed with WES. ABSOLUTE purity (16) was examined in 
WES data, and successful mutation and copy-number calls 
could be made for all but two of these samples (Supplemen-
tary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Consistent with prior genome sequencing studies of pri-
mary PDAC samples, samples from our cohort of patients 
with PDAC displayed low neoplastic cellularity, with a median 
cellularity by histologic assessment of 40%, and by WES using 
the ABSOLUTE algorithm of 34% (Supplementary Fig. S2A–
S2B; ref. 16). Neoplastic cellularity estimates by histologic 
assessment and by the ABSOLUTE algorithm on WES data 
were significantly correlated (Pearson product–moment corre-
lation = 0.386; 95% CI, 0.195–0.548; P = 0.00016; Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2A). This level of correlation is consistent with that 
 
observed in other studies (12, 16) and is affected by variability 
between biopsy specimens as well as differential sensitivity 
between the two methods for identification of neoplastic 
cellularity. For our biopsy samples, we performed deep WES 
with a median of mean target coverage of 191× in the tumor 
and 176× in the normal (Supplementary Table S2). Within 
the CLIA-certified phase of the study, analyzed results were 
available within an average of 39 days (range, 16–67) from 
the date of clinically indicated biopsies and 28 days (range, 
15–51) for research-only biopsies (Supplementary Table S2). 
Additional time for return of results for clinically indicated 
biopsies was required, as these specimens were held in the 
pathology department until a formal histologic diagnosis was 
confirmed. A report of clinically relevant events was returned 
to the referring clinician detailing somatic mutations, small 
insertions/deletions, and copy-number alterations (CNA) as 
well as pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline alterations in a 
curated list of 81 PDAC-relevant genes (Supplementary Table 
S3). These genes were chosen based on somatic or germline 
clinical relevance, therapeutic actionability, and/or recur-
rent mutation across published PDAC genome-sequencing 
cohorts (4–12). Most of these genes (n = 69) were associated 
with clinical trial or off-label FDA-approved targeted thera-
pies. Comprehensive analysis of all genes from WES data was 
simultaneously performed in the research setting.
Landscape of Somatic Mutations and CNAs  
in Advanced PDAC
Genome-sequencing studies have elucidated the molec-
ular landscape of archived primary PDAC tumors and have 
demonstrated distinct molecular subtypes of disease (6–12). 
In our cohort of 71 patients with PDAC, we identified signifi-
cantly recurrent mutations in KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, 
ARID1A, and TGFBR2—a collection of genes that were also 
recurrently mutated in primary PDAC tumors (refs. 7, 10, 12; 
Fig. 1). Moreover, we observed frequent mutations in addi-
tional tumor suppressor genes (e.g., RNF43) or oncogenes 
(e.g., BRAF, GNAS), as well as recurrent mutations in genes 
involved in DNA-damage repair (DDR) and chromatin modi-
fication (Fig. 1). Recurrent high-level amplifications were 
observed in several genomic loci, encompassing genes such 
as MYC, AKT2, and GATA6 (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S3). 
Deletions were identified at numerous loci, including fre-
quent homozygous deletions of CDKN2A and SMAD4 (Fig. 1; 
Supplementary Fig. S3).
Mutational Signature Analysis from WES Data
Mutational signature analysis was performed using a 
Bayesian variant of the non-negative matrix factorization 
approach in a two-stage manner from the set of single-nucle-
otide variants (SNV) in our dataset, as previously described 
(SignatureAnalyzer; Supplementary Experimental Methods; 
refs. 17–20). First, we performed de novo signature discovery 
and our analytic pipeline identified three primary signatures: 
SigA that best resembled Catalogue of Somatic Mutations 
in Cancer (COSMIC) signature 3 with cosine similarity 0.87 
[BRCA mutant signature suggestive of homologous recombi-
nation deficiency (HRD)]; SigB that best resembled COSMIC 
signature 1 with cosine similarity 0.96 (C>T transitions at CpG 
dinucleotides, Aging); and SigC that best resembled COSMIC 
signature 17 with cosine similarity 0.91 (etiology unknown; 
Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4B). In addition, we observed a 
relative elevation of C>G transversions and C>T transitions 
at TC[A/T] contexts in SigA corresponding to canonical hot-
spots of APOBEC mutagenesis (COSMIC signatures 2 and 13), 
 
suggesting that APOBEC signature is possibly operative in 
this cohort, but not cleanly separable due to a lack of muta-
tions (17). Based on this de novo analysis, we concluded that 
four main mutational processes were likely active in these 
data (Aging/COSMIC1, BRCA/HRD/COSMIC3, APOBEC/
COSMIC2+13, and COSMIC17). To better evaluate discrete 
contributions of these mutational processes in our data and to 
minimize signature contamination, we next performed a pro-
jection analysis to infer a signature activity across our biopsy 
cohort using the signature profiles of the five contributing 
COSMIC signatures: COSMIC1, 2, 3, 13, 17 (Fig. 2A; Supple-
mentary Experimental Methods). Consistent with the de novo 
analysis, the inferred signature activity with these five COSMIC 
signatures reveals a clear contribution of the Aging/COSMIC1 
signature in almost all patients and a notable activity of the 
HRD/COSMIC3 signatures in many patients (Fig. 2A).

To further investigate the HRD/COSMIC3 signature in these 
data, we integrated mutation and copy-number data from WES 
and gene-expression data from RNA-seq for a core set of known 
homologous recombination (HR) genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, 
and RAD51C) that are known to be associated with the HRD/
COSMIC3 signature (18) and categorized samples as “HRD 
altered” or “WT” (wild-type). We defined HRD-altered sam-
ples based on the presence of damaging germline and somatic 
mutations (null, truncating, and splice-site variants), homozy-
gous deletions, or more than 2-fold downregulation of mRNA 
expression levels. We observed a significant enrichment of HRD/ 
COSMIC3 signature mutations within HRD-altered samples 
(Fig. 2B; P < 0.000002 by one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test). 
The increased occurrence of large deletions of up to 50 base 
pairs with overlapping microhomology is another characteristic 
of HR-deficient samples, and we indeed observed an increased 
incidence of such deletions (≥9 base pairs) in our HRD-altered 
samples (Fig. 2C; P < 0.00002 by one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test). Eight of the top 14 samples with HRD/COSMIC3 signa-
ture activity harbored deleterious mutations or homozygous 
deletions in one of the four core HRD genes. Six of these eight 
HRD-altered samples had both germline and somatic events 
or a somatic alteration with coexisting loss of heterozygosity 
(LOH) in BRCA1 or BRCA2, supporting a “two-hit” hypothesis. 
Another sample (0400253) had both a p.Q750* nonsense and a 
p.F1016S missense mutation in PALB2. Furthermore, one sam-
ple harbored homozygous deletion of RAD51C. Two additional 
samples with HRD/COSMIC3 signature activity but without 
genomic alterations in the four core HRD genes displayed 
downregulation of RAD51C expression in the RNA-seq data, 
an event previously associated with HRD/COSMIC3 signature 
activity (18). Thus, a total of 10 of 14 samples with a high HRD/ 
COSMIC3 signature activity could be explained by genomic 
alterations or downregulation of gene expression in BRCA1, 
BRCA2, PALB2, or RAD51C (Fig. 2B).
Notably, we also observed 4 samples that did not have 
clear DNA alterations or mRNA downregulation of BRCA1, 
BRCA2, PALB2, or RAD51C but nevertheless had enrichment 
of the HRD/COSMIC3 mutational signature at a level equal 
to or greater than those samples in the HRD-altered class 
(Fig. 2B and C). We conducted a broader examination of 
genes involved in DDR, including those responsible for HR, 
nonhomologous end joining, base excision repair, nucleotide 
excision repair (NER), and DDR checkpoint responses. One 
patient with a high activity of the HRD/COSMIC3 signa-
ture had an ERCC2N238S mutation in a conserved helicase

domain of this key enzyme involved in NER. This ERCC2N238S 
mutation corresponds to one of the recurrent mutational 
hotspots observed in patients with muscle-invasive urothelial 
carcinoma who achieved a complete response to neoadju-
vant cisplatin-based therapy (21). ERCC2 mutations have 
been associated with a separate mutational signature that 
has a significant overlap with the HRD/COSMIC3 signature 
(20); thus, the apparent enrichment of the HRD/COSMIC3 
signature for this patient with PDAC with an ERCC2N238S 
mutation may be attributed to the presence of an ERCC2 
mutational signature. Notably, this patient experienced a par-
tial response to platinum-based FOLFIRINOX therapy (5-FU, 
leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin), but progressed after

with unexplained HRD/COSMIC3 signature enrichment, we 
did not observe other mutations or copy-number events 
in recognized DDR genes. Thus, our data suggest that the 
HRD/COSMIC3 signature analysis in WES data may detect 
additional patients with HRD not identifi
 ed solely by muta-
tion profi
 ling of specifi
 c genes known to be related to HR. 
 
 
Germline Mutations 
 
Identifi
 cation of germline variants associated with PDAC can 
have important implications for treatment of the proband as 
well as for counseling and genetic screening of family members. 
Thus, in addition to somatic mutation and copy-number analy-
sis, we simultaneously interrogated each patient’s germline 
sequencing data for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 81 
genes (Supplementary Table S3). In total, we observed patho-
genic/likely pathogenic germline variants in 18% (13/71) of 
patients ( 
Table 1 
;  
Fig. 1 
). These patients were referred for 
genetic counseling and outreach to family members ( 
Table 1 
). 
 
 
Pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants were 
observed in several DDR genes, including  
BRCA1 
 ( 
n 
 = 2), 
 
BRCA2 
 ( 
n 
 = 3), and  
ATM 
 ( 
n 
 = 3). An additional pathogenic 
 
CHEK2 
 deletion was observed through commercial testing 
in a patient who was referred due to a strong family history 
of malignancy ( 
Table 1 
). Notably, our CLIA-certifi
 ed WES 
platform was not validated for detection of exon-level CNAs 
in the germline at the time of this study. However, reexamina-
tion of the germline WES data confi
 rmed the  
CHEK2 
 deletion 
seen on commercial testing. 
 
All 5 patients with a germline mutation in  
BRCA1 
 or 
 
BRCA2 
 demonstrated evidence of enrichment in the genomic 
HRD/COSMIC3 signature ( 
Fig. 2B 
), as well as LOH through 
somatic copy-number loss of the wild-type allele ( 
Table 1 
). 
However, only 1 of 3 patients with a germline  
ATM 
 muta-
tion harbored a somatic alteration in the other allele. A 
somatic second hit was also not identifi
 ed for patients with 
germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic mutations in

FANCA, FANCL, or RAD50. Beyond the BRCA1/2-mutant 
cases, none of the patients harboring other germline DDR 
gene mutations showed evidence of HRD/COSMIC3 signa-
ture enrichment (Fig. 2B). The mean age at diagnosis did 
not significantly differ between cohorts with or without a 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline mutation (60.2 vs. 
63.9 years, respectively; two-tailed t test, P = 0.14).
RNA-seq of PDAC Biopsies
Recent gene expression studies have identified subtypes of 
PDAC with prognostic and biological relevance (7, 12–14). 
These studies converge on at least two major neoplas-
tic subtypes of PDAC including a squamous/basal-like/
quasimesenchymal subtype and a classic/pancreatic progen-
itor subtype. To investigate these neoplastic PDAC subsets 
within our metastatic biopsy cohort, we performed RNA-seq 
on a separate biopsy specimen from that used for WES. We 
achieved successful RNA extraction and sequencing from 
80% (63/79) of patients (Supplementary Fig. S1). Consistent 
with our prior observations in primary PDAC specimens, we 
observed clear distinctions at the RNA level of the basal-like 
and classic subtypes (ref. 14; Fig. 3A). However, samples 
with low neoplastic cellularity were more difficult to clas-
sify with the basal-like and classic subtype gene sets, and 
several of these samples showed a strong association with 
gene expression from normal liver tissue (Fig. 3A and B; 
Supplementary Fig. S5A), suggesting that the biopsy may 
have captured primarily adjacent liver parenchyma rather 
than the target tumor lesion. Moreover, integrated analysis 
of tumor and normal gene expression enabled clustering of 
samples by tumor-specific subtype and site of biopsy as well 
as identification of outlier samples based on tumor type, 
atypical genetic lesions, or predominant contribution from 
adjacent normal or stromal gene expression (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S5B).
In addition to neoplastic subtypes of PDAC, two stro-
mal subtypes have been identified: “normal” and “activated” 
stromal subtypes (14). To capture a single composite stroma 
signature, we generated a merged “stroma score” reflecting 
the combined total expression of the top 25 activated and 
top 25 normal expressed stroma genes. Notably, biopsies 
from metastatic liver lesions on average demonstrated lower 
stroma scores than those from other sites or compared with 
primary tumor resection specimens (Fig. 3C). Comparison of 
ABSOLUTE neoplastic cellularity derived from WES revealed 
a trend toward higher neoplastic cellularity for liver lesions 
(mean 0.39) versus pancreatic biopsies or resections (mean 
0.30; two sample t test, P = 0.07; Supplementary Fig. S2B). 
Despite liver metastases showing on average lower stroma 
scores, many samples did show elevated scores at a level simi-
lar to those seen in primary resections or biopsies of other 
sites. Thus, the stroma score shows important differences 
according to site of biopsy but also significant interpatient 
variability within each biopsy site.
Clinically Relevant Genomic Events
Genomic analyses of primary specimens have suggested 
that approximately 40% of patients with PDAC may har-
bor clinically relevant genomic events that could potentially 
affect treatment decisions (12). However, most patients with 
PDAC do not undergo timely genomic analysis to identify 
these events for clinical decision-making. Leveraging our 
rapid turnaround CLIA-certified sequencing program, we 
performed real-time assessment of genomic data for use 
in clinical decision-making (Supplementary Fig. S6A; Sup-
plementary Table S4). Excluding common events in KRAS 
or CDKN2A, 48% (34/71) of patients within this cohort had 
cancers with at least one genomic alteration that could poten-
tially confer eligibility for current clinical trials or support 
off-label usage of an agent approved for another indication 
(Supplementary Fig. S6A). Furthermore, 11% (8/71) of the 
patients had cancers with two or more such events, sug-
gesting a potential basis for genotype-driven combination 
therapy trials.
KRAS mutations were observed in 90% (64/71) of patients 
in our cohort. Although this alteration has been used to 
enroll patients onto clinical trials of MAPK-directed ther-
apy, these trials have demonstrated limited efficacy to date 
(22). However, in the subset of KRAS wild-type tumors, we 
observed mutations and CNAs in additional MAPK path-
way activating genes, such as BRAF mutations (see below), 
a ROS1 translocation and high-level FGFR1 amplification 
(Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S6A). Across the entire cohort, 
we observed multiple other alterations that could warrant 
experimental therapies, including RNF43 mutation (e.g., 
porcupine inhibitor), AKT2 amplification (e.g., AKT inhibi-
tor), TSC2 mutation (e.g., MTOR inhibitor), MYC amplifica-
tion (e.g., bromodomain inhibitor), and CDK4 amplification 
(e.g., CDK4 inhibitor; Supplementary Fig. S6A). Moreover, 
sequencing identified other lesions that may contraindicate 
therapy with certain agents, such as RB1 mutations (n = 4 
patients) and CDK4/6 inhibition.
A total of 24% (17/71) of patients enrolled on the PancSeq 
study were treated with an experimental agent, either through 
enrollment onto a clinical trial or through off-label use of an 
approved agent (Table 2). In particular, genomic informa-
tion from WES dictated the choice of experimental agent in 
15% (11/71) of cases. Moreover, 18% (13/71) of patients had 
a clinically relevant germline mutation necessitating referral 
for genetic counseling (Table 1). Thus, accounting for both 
new therapeutic options and genetic counseling indications, 
a total of 30% (21/71) of patients enrolled on the PancSeq 
protocol experienced a change in clinical management as a 
result of the obtained genomic data (Tables 1 and 2).
DDR Mutations and PARP Inhibitor Therapy
In 20% of patients, we observed germline and/or somatic 
alterations in one or more of the following DDR genes: 
BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, and CHEK2 (Fig. 1; Supplemen-
tary Fig. S6B). When considering mutations in a wider spec-
trum of genes across several DDR classes, as well as specific 
mutational signatures consistent with HRD, we identified a 
total of 44% (31/71) of patients displaying genomic evidence 
of potential DDR deficiency (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 
S6B). DDR gene mutations may confer increased sensitivity 
to platinum chemotherapy (9). Moreover, BRCA1 or BRCA2 
gene mutations have been reported to confer sensitivity to 
poly-ADP polymerase (PARP) inhibition in preclinical mod-
els and early clinical trials of PDAC (9, 23, 24). All 6 patients

As noted above, 2 patients with BRCA2 alterations were 
treated with off-label olaparib. The patient harboring a 
somatic BRCA2 mutation was a 45-year-old man who pre-
sented with jaundice and abdominal pain and was diag-
nosed with metastatic PDAC involving the liver and lymph 
nodes, with a serum CA19–9 of 3,592 U/mL on presenta-
tion. He underwent biopsy of a metastatic liver lesion which 
confirmed a poorly differentiated PDAC. Genome sequencing 
 
on the PancSeq protocol revealed KRAS (p.G12R), TP53 
(p.M246fs), and somatic BRCA2 (p.LS298fs) mutations (Fig. 
4A). He received first-line therapy with the platinum-contain-
ing regimen FOLFIRINOX and experienced normalization of 
serum CA19-9 levels (Fig. 4B) and a complete radiographic 
response to therapy within 5 months of treatment (Fig. 4C). 
FOLFIRINOX was discontinued after a total of 13 two-week 
cycles due to transaminitis and neuropathy. The patient

initiated on off-label olaparib 300 mg twice daily as mainte-

BRAF-Mutant PDAC and Response  
to MAPK Inhibition
Within our CLIA-certified cohort, we discovered 2 patients 
with in-frame deletions in the BRAF oncogene (Fig. 5A). This 
class of deletions near the alphaC-helix region of the kinase 
domain has recently been shown to occur in KRAS wild-type 
PDAC and activates the protein to drive MAPK signaling (12, 
25, 26). Furthermore, PDAC cell lines grown in vitro or as in 
vivo xenografts have been shown to be sensitive to MAPK 
inhibition, although this approach had not been tested in 
humans (26). To further define the frequency of this BRAF 
alteration in PDAC, we investigated a larger collection of 
samples (N = 406) profiled with a targeted genome sequenc-
ing panel at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (27, 28) and found 
four KRAS wild-type tumors that harbored the same in-
frame deletion (p.N486_P490del) and one additional KRAS 
wild-type tumor with a small, likely oncogenic in-frame 
insertion (p.T599dup). Thus, BRAF in-frame insertions or 
deletions occurred in approximately 10% of our patients 
with KRAS wild-type PDAC or 1% of all patients with PDAC 
(12, 25, 26).
In one case, a 66-year-old woman presented with dys-
pepsia and weight loss and was diagnosed with PDAC and 
liver metastases. She underwent first-line therapy with FOL-
FIRINOX but experienced progression of disease after only 
5 two-week cycles. She underwent a biopsy and WES on 
the PancSeq protocol and then began second-line therapy 
with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel that was discontinued 
after 6 four-week cycles due to disease progression (Fig. 
5B). Sequencing revealed a BRAF in-frame deletion (p.N486-
P490del) and TP53 mutation (p.V157G; Fig. 5A and B). Given 
that cell lines harboring this mutation were sensitive to 
MEK inhibitors but resistant to selective BRAF inhibitors in 
preclinical models (26), she was initiated on off-label treat-
ment with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib, which is FDA 
approved for use in BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma (Fig. 5B; 
refs. 29–31). Within 4 weeks of initiating therapy, her serum 
CA19-9 had fallen from 36,000 to 8,100 U/mL, and the first 
restaging scan done 8 weeks after initiation of trametinib 
showed a partial response to therapy (Fig. 5C and D). Serial 
plasma samples were collected to measure the fractional 
abundance of BRAF- and TP53-mutant alleles in circulating 
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) by droplet-digital PCR (ddPCR; refs. 
32, 33). cfDNA measurements for BRAF and TP53 alleles 
(two clonal alterations in this tumor) revealed a dramatic 
decline in response to trametinib therapy that mirrored the 
radiographic findings (Fig. 5E). After 5 months on trametinib 
therapy, a rise in the fractional abundance of the BRAF- and 
TP53-mutant alleles in cfDNA was observed. After 6 months 
of therapy, radiographic progression was identified. Evalua-
tion of a more comprehensive panel of genes within cfDNA 
was pursued through a commercial test (Guardant360) at 
the time of progression and demonstrated the emergence of 
multiple subclonal mutations in the MAP2K2 (MEK2) gene 
(Fig. 5E). Notably, these mutations are homologous to MEK1 
mutations that have been previously described to confer 
resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro in mutagenesis studies 
in BRAF-mutant melanoma (34). Retrospective analysis of the 
MEK2 mutations in serial plasma samples collected through 
the patient’s treatment course revealed emergence of these 
mutant alelles in concert with increases in fractional abun-
dance of mutant BRAF and TP53 alleles (Fig. 5E). Thus, these 
data likely reflect the emergence of heterogeneous polyclonal 
resistance mechanisms that evolved under the selective pres-
sure of trametinib therapy.
Given the emergence of MAP2K2 resistance mutations 
while on trametinib therapy, the patient was subsequently 
treated with ulixertinib/BVD-523, an inhibitor of ERK1/2 
(which signals downstream of MEK1/2), on a single-patient 
investigational new drug application. After treatment with 
ulixertinib/BVD-523 for 17 days, cfDNA analysis by ddPCR 
demonstrated a rapid decline in the fractional abundance 
of the BRAF- and TP53-mutant alleles (Fig. 5E). The MEK2 
resistance alleles also rapidly decreased in absolute frequency 
and in relative abundance with respect to the overall tumor 
burden (as measured by the total MEK2/TP53 ratio; Fig. 5E). 
Unfortunately, the patient’s functional status was quickly 
declining as she initiated therapy with ulixertinib/BVD-523, 
and this medication was stopped after 3 weeks of therapy. A 
last blood collection after cessation of ulixertinib/BVD-523 
demonstrated rebound of the fractional abundance of the 
BRAF- and TP53-mutant alleles. The patient expired at home 
several weeks later with hospice services. This patient’s clini-
cal course suggests that a BRAF in-frame deletion may serve 
as an important biomarker for response to MAPK inhibition 
in patients with pancreatic cancer.
DISCUSSION
Many barriers to precision medicine exist for patients with 
PDAC, including low neoplastic cellularity of tumors and the 
aggressive nature of the disease that makes timely biopsy and 
genomic analysis difficult. We have established an integrated 
biopsy program for patients with advanced PDAC that ena-
bles CLIA-certified genomic profiling and rapid turnaround 
of WES data to referring clinicians. To overcome the chal-
lenges of low neoplastic cellularity, we have performed deep 
WES on small-volume tumor biopsies and germline DNA 
and have used analytic algorithms to accurately quantitate 
tumor DNA content and to identify mutations and CNAs. In 
addition, we have identified molecular driver alterations and 
clinically relevant subsets of disease in real time, during the 
course of the patient’s illness. In an initial biopsy cohort of 
79 patients, we obtained high-quality genomic information 
for 71 patients and identified potentially actionable somatic 
and germline alterations in 48% of cases. These include 26 
patients harboring tumors with DDR gene mutations and 7 
with KRAS wild-type tumors, including 2 with BRAF altera-
tions and 1 with a ROS1 translocation. We have demonstrated 
how these data can affect clinical decision making, utilizing 
molecular information to treat multiple patients on clinical 
trials or with use of off-label targeted therapies. Neverthe-
less, further study will be necessary to confirm the rate 
 
and therapeutic implications of actionable alterations in a

multi-institutional population of patients with PDAC. Over-
all, 30% (21/71) of enrolled patients experienced a change in 
clinical management as a result of genomic data, including 
15% of patients for whom genomic information dictated the 
choice of an experimental agent and 18% of patients whose 
germline data warranted referral for genetic counseling. 
These numbers far exceed the average experience for patients 
with PDAC, and these data support the implementation of 
genomic evaluation as a standard clinical practice in patients 
with advanced PDAC.
We identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline 
mutations in 18% of patients in our cohort of patients with 
advanced PDAC. Analysis of germline variants was performed 
within a set of 81 genes included in our CLIA-certified analy-
sis pipeline (Supplementary Table S3). Thus, this analysis 
may underestimate the true number of patients with PDAC 
with a hereditary pancreatic cancer predisposition. However, 
18% is higher than the approximately 4% to 12% incidence 
of pathogenic germline variants that has been reported in 
recent primary tumor cohorts (12, 35, 36). This higher rate of 
germline variants may be due to the larger number of genes 
examined, different distribution of Ashkenazi Jewish patients 
(who are known to have higher rates of germline variants), the 
selected patient population who provided informed consent 
for research biopsy, and potential enrichment of germline 
variants in patients with advanced PDAC. Regarding the 
latter point, a similar observation of enrichment for germ-
line mutations in DDR genes has been made in metastatic 
prostate cancer (37). Nevertheless, the frequency of germline 
mutations in patients with advanced PDAC will require fur-
ther validation. Annotation of Ashkenazi Jewish descent was 
incomplete for patients included in the current study. How-
ever, only 3 of the 13 identified germline alterations were 
known to be Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations.
Although all tumors with germline mutant BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 genes demonstrated somatic mutation or LOH of 
the second allele, only 2 of 9 (22%) of the other identified 
germline mutant genes demonstrated somatic mutation or 
LOH. The functional implications for loss or retention of the 
wild-type allele remain an important unanswered question 
that is worthy of further investigation. Given the prevalence 
of germline mutations in patients with PDAC, several groups 
now advocate for universal multigene germline testing for all 
patients, irrespective of family history or age at diagnosis (35, 
38–40). The most effective approach to implementing univer-
sal germline testing as well as the optimal bioinformatic and 
functional frameworks for interpreting these data remain 
important to define.
As has been suggested in prior studies of primary PDAC 
resection specimens (7, 9, 12), we observed a striking preva-
lence of germline and somatic mutations in DDR genes in 
our cohort of patients with advanced PDAC. Beyond the 
37% (26/71) of patients with DDR gene mutations or CNAs, 
9 of whom had HRD/COSMIC3 signature enrichment, an 
additional 7% (5/71) of patients had enrichment of an HRD/
COSMIC3 signature but no clear associated HR gene altera-
tion. Two of these cases could be explained by downregula-
tion of mRNA expression of RAD51C; however, three samples 
had HRD/COSMIC3 signature activity but no clear causal 
genetic or gene expression feature to explain the signature. 
Although the therapeutic implications of HRD/COSMIC3 
signature enrichment without an identifiable mutation need 
further validation in preclinical models, this result suggests 
that more patients may have functional DDR deficiency than 
is detectable by DNA mutational profiling alone, thus argu-
ing in favor of performing more global genomic characteri-
zation approaches such as WES in concert with integrative 
analyses of gene expression in patients with PDAC. Notably, 
whole-genome sequencing of PDAC has also suggested that 
chromosomally unstable tumors with a large number of 
structural variation events are associated with a BRCA muta-
tional signature (9). We were unable to similarly evaluate the 
number of structural rearrangements in these tumors using 
WES, and additional studies will be needed to understand the 
association of DDR gene mutations, HRD/COSMIC3 muta-
tional signature enrichment, and structural variation events.
In this study, 6 patients with DDR gene mutations were 
treated off-label or enrolled on clinical trials of PARP inhibi-
tor therapy. Understanding the gene- and allele-specific dif-
ferences for DDR genes conferring sensitivity to platinum 
chemotherapy, PARP inhibition, or other inhibitors of DDR 
checkpoints will be critical to enabling effective stratification 
of patients with PDAC onto efficacious therapies. As noted 
above, the functional implications of genomic correlates on 
therapeutic responsiveness, including somatic LOH versus 
retention of the wild-type allele or COSMIC3/HRD signature 
activity, also need further investigation in patient-derived 
models as well as in human clinical trials.
We and others have noted the importance of alternative 
oncogenic driver events in KRAS wild-type PDAC (10, 12, 
41). Here, we demonstrate multiple oncogenic and targeta-
ble lesions that occur in KRAS wild-type tumors, includ-
ing alterations in BRAF, ROS1, FGFR1, and other genes. In 
particular, we have identified in-frame deletions in BRAF in 
2 patients in our cohort. These lesions have been reported 
to result in oncogenic activation (25, 26). We report the 
first human therapeutic experience with MAPK inhibition 
in a patient harboring a BRAF in-frame deletion. We dem-
onstrate substantial clinical benefit in a patient who had a 
partial response to the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib (Fig. 
5). Furthermore, by serial monitoring of driver alterations in 
plasma cfDNA through multiple lines of treatment, we pro-
vide molecular evidence for disease response and progression, 
as well as the emergence of heterogeneous MEK2 resistance 
alleles that correspond to radiographic progression of disease 
on trametinib. This patient was subsequently treated with an 
ERK inhibitor after progression on trametinib and showed 
a second decline in mutant BRAF and TP53 alleles within 
cfDNA and suppression of MAP2K2 resistance alleles, sug-
gesting further evidence of response to MAPK inhibition. A 
second patient with rapidly progressive BRAF-mutant disease 
was also treated with off-label trametinib but failed to show 
a response. This heterogeneity of primary and secondary 
resistance mechanisms will necessitate effective combination 
therapy strategies with MAPK inhibition. These data suggest 
that a larger multicenter clinical trial with proper molecu-
lar correlates, including cfDNA monitoring of therapeutic 
response and resistance, should be developed to fully investi-
gate the therapeutic efficacy of MAPK inhibition in patients 
with activating oncogenic BRAF deletions.

In parallel to WES of DNA alterations, we also performed 
RNA-seq and demonstrated that RNA signatures of neoplas-
tic PDAC subtypes are readily discernible from small-volume 
metastatic biopsies. The two primary neoplastic subtypes of 
PDAC have been shown to have prognostic importance and 
may correlate with chemosensitivity (14, 42); thus, identifying 
these subtypes and proactively incorporating this stratifica-
tion into clinical trials remains an important translational 
priority. Detection of a high stromal signature was consistent 
across primary tumors and several metastatic sites but more 
variable in liver biopsy specimens, suggesting that the stro-
mal makeup of liver lesions may be distinct from that of pri-
mary tumors. This observation has been made recently using 
an automated histologic approach (43) and will need rigor-
ous follow-up with histologic and molecular approaches. 
Stromal fibroblasts have been proposed to play an impor-
tant role in promoting PDAC progression and in blunting 
chemotherapeutic response (42, 44, 45); however, attempts 
to target fibroblasts in mouse models as well as clinical trials 
have yielded conflicting results (46–48). Additional trials of 
stroma-directed therapies are under way, including vitamin 
D receptor agonists to modulate stromal gene expression and 
improve chemosensitivity (42). Our data highlight the impor-
tance of biopsy and RNA-seq analysis to identify patients and 
even specific metastatic lesions that may respond to stroma-
directed therapy.
Together with recent work from other PDAC referral cent-
ers (41, 49), this study demonstrates the feasibility and value 
of real-time genomic characterization of advanced PDAC and 
provides a path forward for treatment of patients with PDAC 
with molecularly defined therapy. To harness all potential 
therapeutic opportunities in this highly aggressive disease, 
we propose that biopsy-based genomic analysis early in a 
patient’s treatment course should become standard of care 
for all patients with PDAC.
METHODS
Investigators obtained informed, written consent for each patient 
enrolled to the PancSeq protocol (DF/HCC #14-408), and this 
study was performed in accordance with standard ethical guidelines 
approved by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center IRB. DNA and 
RNA were extracted from tumor samples (and normal whole blood 
for germline DNA control), and WES was performed in a labora-
tory certified by CLIA (#22D2055652; refs. 12, 50). WES data were 
processed through the Broad Institute “Picard” pipeline (http://
picard.sourceforge.net/), generating a BAM file for each sample. 
Mutation calling was performed using the MuTect algorithm (51). 
MutSigCV2 was used to determine significantly mutated genes (52). 
GISTIC2.0 was used to identify recurrent deletions and amplifica-
tions (53). ABSOLUTE (16) was used to determine purity, ploidy, 
and whole-genome doubling status using allelic copy-number data 
along with the allelic fraction of all somatic mutations as input. 
Annotated WES data were cross-referenced with a curated list of 81 
PDAC-relevant genes, and variants in these genes were reviewed by 
a certified clinical geneticist. A report of clinically relevant germline 
and somatic events was returned to the referring clinician detailing 
somatic mutations, small insertions/deletions, and CNAs as well as 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline alterations. Only germline 
variants with a population frequency of <1% upon comparison with 
the ExAC database (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) were retained 
for review as pathogenic/likely pathogenic. Mutational signature 
analysis was performed on the set of SNVs in our dataset using 
 
SignatureAnalyzer, as previously described (17–20). RNA-seq was per-
formed on poly-A–selected mRNA at the Broad Institute, and gene-
expression signatures were derived from Moffitt and colleagues (14). 
cfDNA analysis was performed by ddPCR as previously described (32, 
33) or through a commercial assay (Guardant360; ref. 54). See also 
the Supplementary Experimental Methods for further description of 
experimental procedures. Data in this study have been deposited in 
dbGaP under accession number phs001652.v1.p1.
