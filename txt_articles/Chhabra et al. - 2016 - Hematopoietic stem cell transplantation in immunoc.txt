Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation can cure diverse diseases of the blood system, including hematologic
malignancies, anemias, and autoimmune disorders. However, patients must undergo toxic conditioning regimens
that use chemotherapy and/or radiation to eliminate host HSCs and enable donor HSC engraftment. Previous
studies have shown that anti–c-Kit monoclonal antibodies deplete HSCs from bone marrow niches, allowing
donor HSC engraftment in immunodeficient mice. We show that host HSC clearance is dependent on Fc-
mediated antibody effector functions, and enhancing effector activity through blockade of CD47, a myeloid-
specific immune checkpoint, extends anti–c-Kit conditioning to fully immunocompetent mice. The combined
treatment leads to elimination of >99% of host HSCs and robust multilineage blood reconstitution after HSC trans-
plantation. This targeted conditioning regimen that uses only biologic agents has the potential to transform the
practice of HSC transplantation and enable its use in a wider spectrum of patients.
INTRODUCTION
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are multipotent stem cells that give
rise to all cells of the blood system for the life of an individual (1).
HSCs reside in specialized “niches” within the bone marrow that allow
them to self-renew and remain in an undifferentiated state (1–3). Trans-
plantation of HSCs into a host can regenerate a healthy blood system
and, in so doing, cure many life-threatening blood disorders, auto-
immune diseases, and hematologic malignancies. However, to achieve
successful engraftment of exogenous HSCs, two obstacles must be
overcome. First, donor HSCs must escape immune rejection by the
recipient, and second, the transplanted cells must have access to niche
space within the recipient bone marrow (2–4). The current con-
ditioning regimens of radiation and/or chemotherapy simultaneously
immunosuppress recipients by lymphoablation and elimination of res-
ident HSCs to free bone marrow niches. However, these procedures
also result in nonspecific injury to other tissues and can cause lifelong
complications (5, 6). Consequently, HSC transplantation is reserved
for those with life-threatening disorders where the benefits are thought
to outweigh the risks of the procedure. Safer and more targeted con-
ditioning protocols could both improve the safety of transplantation
and extend the existing clinical utility of this powerful form of cell
therapy. Transplantation of purified allogeneic HSC has been shown
in animal models to result in replacement of diseased hematopoietic
cells without the complication of graft-versus-host disease (7). Pure
HSC transplantations induce permanent transplantation tolerance of
cells, tissues, or organs from the HSC donor and therefore represent
a major platform upon which regenerative medicine rests (8).
HSCs and downstream hematopoietic progenitors express c-Kit
(CD117), a dimeric transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (fig. S1)
(9). Signaling engaged by c-Kit ligand (KL) is essential for numerous HSC
functions, including homing, proliferation, adhesion, maintenance, and
survival (10–12). The critical role of c-Kit in HSC regulation is evidenced
in W41/W41 mice that harbor hypomorphic c-Kit alleles. W41/W41 mice
have reduced numbers of HSCs (13) and can be robustly reconstituted
by exogenous HSCs with minimal radiation (14). Similarly, immuno-
compromised c-Kit mutant mice can be used for allogeneic HSC
transplantation (15) and engrafted by human HSCs (16) without any
irradiation. Furthermore, targeted deletion of KL in perivascular cells
results in loss of HSCs in vivo, thus establishing the requirement for
KL in addition to the c-Kit receptor (17).
Administration of an anti-mouse c-Kit monoclonal antibody (mAb)
(ACK2) into immunocompromised Rag2−/−gc−/− and Rag2−/− mice
depletes host HSCs and enables exogenous HSCs to engraft (18). Simi-
larly, administration of ACK2 in utero eliminates HSCs in developing
mouse embryos and permits HSC engraftment in neonates (19). How-
ever, ACK2 as a single agent is incapable of conditioning immunocom-
petent adult mice to accept donor HSCs, and its combination with at
least low-dose radiation is required for ACK2-mediated depletion of
HSCs and engraftment in immunocompetent mice (20).
CD47, a transmembrane protein expressed on HSC and many other cell
types, is a “don’t eat me” signal that is an innate immune checkpoint and
acts as a critical “marker of self” to attenuate antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity/phagocytosis (ADCC/ADCP) via its interaction with
SIRPa on neutrophils and macrophages (21–23). Mobilized or naturally
circulating HSCs in peripheral blood up-regulate expression of surface CD47
to avoid destruction by macrophages in the perisinusoidal spaces in bone
marrow, spleen, and liver (24). High levels of CD47 expression on many
different cancer cells similarly confer protection of cancer cells from phago-
cytosis (25, 26). Blockade of the CD47-SIRPa axis markedly enhances the
ADCP activity of tumor-opsonizing mAbs in vitro and in vivo (25–27).
Here, we investigated whether CD47 antagonists can potentiate anti–
c-Kit antibody–mediated HSC depletion. We show that selective targeting

 of c-Kit and CD47 with biologic agents only results in robust depletion of
functional HSCs in immunocompetent recipients and permits engraft-
ment of donor congenic HSCs. Furthermore, addition of T cell–depleting
antibodies to achieve immune ablation in models of allogeneic HSC
transplantation allowed robust HSC engraftment. These studies dem-
onstrate a promising approach that has the potential to markedly im-
prove the safety and broaden the use of HSC transplantation by
targeted host conditioning, devoid of DNA-damaging agents.
RESULTS
Anti–c-Kit antibodies deplete HSCs in an
Fc-dependent manner
We compared the ability of the anti–c-Kit antibody ACK2 to deplete
HSCs in wild-type versus immunodeficient Rag2−/−cg−/− mice. As ob-
served previously (18), ACK2-mediated depletion of immunopheno-
typic Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+CD150+Flt3−CD34− long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs)
was greater in Rag2−/−cg−/− than in wild-
type mice (Fig. 1A). In Rag2−/−cg−/−
mice, a single 500-mg dose of ACK2 re-
duced LT-HSC numbers by greater than
four orders of magnitude 6 days after ad-
ministration. By contrast, in wild-type
mice, ACK2 administration produced a
modest (<10-fold) decrease in HSCs,
with complete recovery of the HSC com-
partment 6 to 9 days later (Fig. 1A).
To determine whether the depletive
activity of ACK2 could be enhanced in
wild-type animals, we investigated the
mechanism of ACK2-mediated HSC
clearance. Previously, it was surmised
that ACK2 acts primarily by blocking the
interaction between c-Kit and KL based
on studies that showed comparative
lack of effectiveness of 2B8, a different
nonblocking anti–c-Kit antibody (18, 28),
as well as similar loss of HSCs in the
conditional KL knockout (17). However,
multiple factors govern antibody effica-
cy, including Fc structural conformation
and the ability to engage Fc receptors
(FcRs) on host immune cells (29, 30),
which could also explain the differential
activity of 2B8 versus ACK2. We thus ex-
amined whether ACK2 depletes HSC
via effector cell involvement.
We addressed this question through
multiple approaches. We prepared ACK2
Fab fragments, which lack antibody Fc.
The Fc moiety plays a critical role in
immune-mediated cell killing, including
activation of effector cells and phagocy-
tosis of target cells (31). Administration
of intact ACK2 to Rag2−/−cg−/− mice
caused the depletion of HSC in a dose-
dependent manner. In contrast, Fab
fragments of ACK2 had no discernible effect on HSC frequency, in-
dicating that ACK2-mediated HSC depletion is dependent on its Fc
portion (Fig. 1B). To further assess the Fc dependence of ACK2 for
HSC depletion, we used Fcer1g−/− mice that are deficient in the
g-chain subunit of FcRIII, FcRI, and FcRIV. These mice lack function-
al ADCC activity of natural killer (NK) cells, phagocytic capacity of
macrophages and neutrophils, and functional allergic activities of mast
cells and basophils (32). Treatment of ACK2 in Fcer1g−/− mice had no
effect on immunophenotypic HSC number in the bone marrow (Fig.
1C and fig. S2A), whereas a significant (P = 0.0277) but modest re-
duction was observed in wild-type mice (fig. S2B). The number of
functional HSCs was similarly unaffected by ACK2 treatment in these
mice, as determined by competitive transplantation analysis (fig. S2C).
Because ACK2 has been previously demonstrated to effectively condi-
tion Rag2−/−cg−/− mice (18), we treated Rag2−/−cg−/− mice with the
FcR blocking antibody 2.4G2 before ACK2 administration. Whereas
ACK2-treated animals displayed increased granulocyte chimerism af-
ter HSC transplantation as compared to untreated controls, the 2.4G2

 blocking antibody inhibited this effect, demonstrating a general de-
pendency on FcgRIIb and FcgRIII receptors (Fig. 1D). Furthermore,
this effect was not due to a loss of effector cells, because 2.4G2 treat-
ment alone did not cause reduction in myeloid cells in the peripheral
blood, bone marrow, and spleen (fig. S3). Thus, removal of the Fc por-
tion of ACK2 through preparation of Fab fragments, genetic deficien-
cy of FcRs, and pharmacologic blockade of Fc-FcgRIIb and Fc-FcgRIII
receptor interactions each abrogated the HSC-depletive activity of
ACK2. Together, these results establish
that antibody Fc effector functions eli-
cited by ACK2 are necessary for its in
vivo HSC-depletive activity.
CD47 blockade augments
the efficacy of ACK2 for
transplant conditioning
We previously demonstrated in mouse
tumor models that blockade of the
CD47-SIRPa axis markedly enhances
the ADCP activity of antitumor antibo-
dies (27). Hence, we hypothesized that
interruption of the CD47-SIRPa inter-
action might similarly enhance deple-
tion of endogenous HSCs using ACK2
or other anti–c-Kit antibodies. We there-
fore tested engineered fragments of hu-
man SIRPa as high-affinity antagonists
of CD47 (27) or antibodies that block
CD47 activity. The most potent of the
high-affinity variants, CV1 (consensus var-
iant 1), binds human CD47 (hCD47) with
an affinity of 11 pM but cross-reacts more
weakly with mouse CD47 (mCD47), with
>1000-fold lower affinity than hCD47.
We thus sought to redesign CV1 as an
antagonist of mCD47 by fusing CV1 to
the CH3 domain of human immuno-
globulin G1 (IgG1) through a cysteine-
containing hinge (Fig. 2A). Because the
CH3 domain is homodimeric, the fu-
sion protein exists as a disulfide-linked
dimer of CV1 molecules. We reasoned
that this new molecule, which we termed
a CV1 “microbody” (CV1mb), would
have enhanced affinity for mCD47 owing
to the avidity afforded by its dimeric
architecture. CV1mb efficiently blocked
the SIRPa interface of CD47 on both hu-
man and mouse erythrocytes, as deter-
mined by competition with the blocking
anti-hCD47 and anti-mCD47 mAbs
Hu5F9-G4 and MIAP301, respectively
(Fig. 2B). In vitro, CV1mb was functional-
ly equivalent to monomeric CV1, because
it induced no phagocytosis by itself but ro-
bustly synergized with an opsonizing
mAb, cetuximab, which binds to the epi-
dermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
present on a colon cancer cell line (Fig. 2C). We examined the in vivo
duration of action of CV1 and CV1mb by measuring receptor occu-
pancy, the ability to bind and block CD47. To assess the effect of the
microbody format in extending the in vivo persistence of CV1, we
administered CV1mb to mice and performed receptor occupancy stu-
dies of CD47 on mature mouse erythrocytes (which express high
levels of CD47) at several time points after injection. Administration
of a single dose (200 mg) of CV1mb to wild-type mice resulted in a

 more thorough and sustained occupan-
cy of mCD47 on erythrocytes than an
equivalent dose of CV1 monomer,
blocking 96 and 75% of mCD47 after
1 and 24 hours versus 53 and 6% for
CV1 monomer (Fig. 2D). Thus, the fa-
vorable binding, functional, and phar-
macodynamic properties of CV1mb
indicated that it could effectively antag-
onize mCD47 in vivo.
We then studied the effect of com-
bining CD47 blockade using CV1mb
with ACK2 treatment in immuno-
competent C57BL/6.CD90.1 animals.
As seen previously, administration of
500 mg of ACK2 alone in C57BL/6.
CD90.1 failed to produce a sustained
reduction of immunophenotypic HSCs
after 7 days. Similarly, daily intraperi-
toneal injections for 5 days with 500 mg
of CV1mb alone had no appreciable ef-
fect on immunophenotypic HSC num-
bers at the same time point. However,
the combination of ACK2 and CV1mb
resulted in a marked (>10,000-fold) re-
duction of Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+(LSK)
CD150+ Flt3−CD34− LT-HSCs, as de-
termined by flow cytometric analysis
(Fig. 3A). To confirm that functional
HSCs were eliminated, we cotransplanted
whole bone marrow from ACK2/CV1mb-
treated mice with an equal number of
green fluorescent protein–positive (GFP+)
congenic bone marrow cells from unma-
nipulated mice into lethally irradiated
recipients. HSC chimerism measured at
24 weeks after transplant was signifi-
cantly reduced in recipients transplanted
with bone marrow from ACK2 plus
CV1mb–treated mice. In contrast, ro-
bust donor chimerism was observed
in recipients of marrow from untreated
and ACK2-treated mice (Fig. 3B).
Because c-Kit is expressed in the hem-
atopoietic progenitor cells downstream
of HSCs (fig. S1), we hypothesized that
these populations might also be targeted
by ACK2 combined with CV1mb. A sig-
nificant loss of downstream myeloid
progenitors was observed in mice trea-
ted with the combination of ACK2 and
CV1mb (Fig. 3C). Accordingly, mice
treated with combined ACK2 and CV1mb
developed transient reduction of hemat-
ocrit, RBCs, and hemoglobin, as well as
a decrease in white blood cells (fig. S4A).
By histological examination, administra-
tion of ACK2 with CV1mb caused

 marked reduction of bone marrow cellularity. The clearance of the
bone marrow by 7 days after treatment was characterized by a marked
loss of mononuclear cells and RBCs revealing marrow adipocytes (Fig.
3D). This clearance of the bone marrow niche is distinct from the
drastic angiectasis observed 7 days after lethal radiation (fig. S5). No-
tably, combined treatment of ACK2 plus CV1mb did not decrease
functional HSCs in Fcer1g−/− mice (fig. S4B), as shown by no change
in myeloid chimerism, indicating that the mechanism of the combined
treatment regimen is dependent on FcR function. Thus, the near-
complete depletion of HSCs and hematopoietic precursor cells and
the apparent clearance of the bone marrow niche space by ACK2 plus
CV1mb indicated that this combination could effectively precondition
wild-type mice for HSC transplantation.
Preconditioning with ACK2 and CD47 blockade enables HSC
transplantation in wild-type mice
To assess whether the combination of anti–c-Kit and CD47 blockade
could permit donor HSC engraftment in the absence of chemotherapy
or radiation, we treated fully immunocompetent C57Bl/6 CD45.1/
CD45.2 adult mice with ACK2 and CV1mb and performed transplan-
tation of lineage-depleted bone marrow cells (Fig. 4A). Whereas mice
treated with ACK2 alone had very low levels of HSC engraftment,
mice receiving the combination of ACK2 and CV1mb exhibited high
levels of HSC engraftment 20 weeks after transplantation, about two
orders of magnitude greater than the antibody alone (Fig. 4B). More
than 60% donor-derived granulocyte chimerism was observed in the
peripheral blood of ACK2- and CV1mb-treated mice (Fig. 4C), as well
as in the bone marrow (fig. S6A) and spleen (fig. S6E). The engraft-
ment was not limited to the myeloid compartment, because we ob-
served an average of about 40 to 50% B cell (Fig. 4D), 30% T cell
(Fig. 4F), and 60% NK cell donor chimerism in blood (Fig. 4E), as well
as in the spleen (fig. S6, F to H) and bone marrow (fig. S6, B to D). The
engraftment in the peripheral blood was relatively stable 12 weeks after
transplant (fig. S7). T cell engraftment was also observed in the thymus
(fig. S6I). In comparison with conditioning with radiation, we found
that the combination of ACK2 and CV1mb was more effective than
sublethal radiation with 250 or 450 cGy and equivalent to 750 cGy
(fig. S8).
Given the robust synergism between ACK2 and CV1mb, we sought
to determine whether conditioning with ACK2 could be generalized to
other CD47 antagonists. We thus administered ACK2 with monomer-
ic CV1 and an anti-CD47 antibody that blocks both mCD47 and
hCD47 (MIAP410; fig. S9A). These combinations effectively enhanced
ACK2-mediated depletion of functional HSCs similar to CV1mb, as
determined by a competition transplant assay (fig. S9B). Furthermore,
CV1 and MIAP410 enabled HSC transplantation when combined
with ACK2 for conditioning, yielding 45 and 59% granulocyte chime-
rism, respectively (fig. S10A). B cell chimerism was moderate, with
CV1 and ACK2 yielding 17% and MIAP410 combined with ACK2
resulting in 34% donor B cells (fig. S10B). T cell chimerism was low,
with CV1 and ACK2 resulting in 7% and MIAP410 with ACK2 gen-
erating 8% (fig. S10C). These results indicate that pharmacologic CD47
blockade acts to potentiate the HSC-depletive activity of anti–c-Kit anti-
bodies, and that the magnitude of the effect is influenced by the size,
affinity/avidity, and/or antibody isotype of the CD47 antagonist. To
confirm that the potent effect of ACK + MIAP410 is transient, we treated
mice with this combination without HSC rescue and supported them
at their hematopoietic nadir with whole-blood transfusions only. Under
these conditions, recovery of the RBC lineage occurred at about 3 weeks
after antibody treatment (fig. S11).
We wished to determine whether conditioning through the com-
bination of anti–c-Kit antibody and CD47 antagonist could be
extended to a clinically relevant model of allogeneic HSC transplanta-
tion, in which the donor and recipient are matched through human
leukocyte antigen alleles but are mismatched at minor histocom-
patibility complex (mHC) antigens. Unlike radiation and chemo-
therapy, the combination of anti–c-Kit and CD47 blockade is
unique in that it depletes HSC niches but is not expected to complete-
ly immunoablate recipients. Thus, we conditioned BALB/c mice with
combinations of ACK2 and CV1mb or ACK2 and the anti-CD47
antibody MIAP410 in conjunction with immune ablation via T cell–
depleting antibodies (anti-CD4 GK1.5 and anti-CD8 YTS169.4). The
mice were subsequently transplanted with mHC-mismatched B10D2
sorted LSK HSCs (Fig. 5A). Neither ACK2 monotherapy nor treatment
with anti-CD4/8 antibodies successfully conditioned recipient mice to
accept allografted HSCs. However, when ACK + CV1mb or ACK2 +
MIAP410 was combined with a T cell–depleting regimen of anti-CD4
and anti-CD8 antibodies, substantial granulocyte (Fig. 5C), B cell (Fig.
5D), T cell (Fig. 5E), and NK cell (fig. S5D) chimerism, as well as HSC
engraftment (Fig. 5B) in the bone marrow, was observed. This multi-
lineage chimerism was stable 12 weeks after transplant in the
peripheral blood (fig. S12, A to C) and was significantly greater than
untreated recipients (fig. S13, A to D). Multilineage chimerism was also
present in the spleen (fig. S13, F to I), and T cell chimerism was ob-
served in the thymus (fig. S13E). These results establish that a targeted,
entirely biologic conditioning regimen free of DNA-damaging agents
can promote stable purified HSC engraftment even in an allogeneic
HSC transplant model.
DISCUSSION
A principal limitation of HSC transplantation remains the safe and
facile liberation of the niche space to accept the donor graft. Our
results establish that treatment of adult immunocompetent mice with
two biologic agents, opsonizing anti–c-Kit antibodies and CD47 an-
tagonists, leads to extensive depletion of HSC and progenitor cells
and enables exogenous congenic HSCs to robustly engraft. Although
previous studies have attempted to use ACK2 in immunocompetent
recipients, it has not been possible without low-dose radiation. Com-
bination of 300 cGy and 2 mg of ACK2 resulted in HSC chimerism
(20), similar to our protocol of using ACK2 and CD47 antagonism.
When additionally combined with transient depleting anti-lymphocyte
antibodies, this regimen permitted HSC allotransplantation between
mHC-mismatched donor/recipient pairs, the most common trans-
plant scenario encountered clinically. The extension of this approach
to humans could obviate the need for nonspecific toxic therapies that
are the current standard of care and could subsequently allow for HSC
transplantation to be extended to a broader set of patients. This prospect
is particularly appealing in the era of modern gene-editing technolo-
gies, and it is readily conceivable that, for nonmalignant indica-
tions, a regimen consisting of anti–c-Kit plus CV1mb or anti-CD47
antibody such as Hu5F9G4, which is currently undergoing clinical
trials (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02216409 and NCT02367196), could en-
able autologous gene-edited HSC transplants to effectively cure inherited
immunodeficiency, inborn errors of metabolism, hemoglobinopathies,

The superior efficacy of ACK2 at HSC
depletion in immunocompromised mice
compared to immunocompetent wild-type
mice is a question that remains incom-
pletely resolved. Both T and B cells indepen-
dently offer some protection from ACK2,
suggesting two potential mechanisms for
further study. One explanation may be
that regulatory T cells regulate antibody-
directed functions of macrophages, similar
to their inhibition of antibody-dependent
cytotoxicity of NK cells (33). Studies pub-
lished by our group (34) and others (35)
suggest that T cells influence HSC cycling
in and out of the marrow niches. This ef-
fect of T cells is not due to their immune
function per se, but rather appears to be re-
lated to the cytokines locally produced in
the marrow. T cells may also exert control
or suppression over the marrow macro-
phages. Similarly, B cells in wild-type mice
may limit the effectiveness of ACK2
through the production of endogenous im-
munoglobulin, which could compete with
ACK2 for binding to FcRs. This mechanism

 may be similar to the immunosuppressive ef-
fect elicited by administration of intravenous
immunoglobulin. Irrespective of the cause of
attenuated action of ACK2 in wild-type ani-
mals, the augmented efficacy of the antibody
by CD47 blockade extends the treatment princi-
ple to a more realistic model of clinical practice.
The principal toxicity of cytopenias that we
observed from the combined targeting of CD47
and c-Kit was secondary to stem and pro-
genitor niche clearance, the intended conse-
quence of this therapy. Mice receiving ACK2 +
CD47 antagonists exhibited substantial reduc-
tion in hematologic parameters, particularly
with respect to RBC indices. The half-life of
RBCs in mice is shorter than that in humans
(36), which may, in part, explain this effect.
That said, in the clinical setting, this toxicity
can be mitigated by careful monitoring and
transient supportive transfusions. CD47-
blocking therapies themselves can affect
RBC indices, but dosing strategies have been
described to avoid this toxicity (37). Further-
more, our studies use high doses of donor
HSCs to achieve rapid blood cell recovery,
a strategy that is clinically feasible as the num-
bers are similar to previously performed mega-
dose CD34+ cell transplants (38). c-Kit is
widely expressed on other tissues. Hence, un-
wanted off-target effects are possible. However,
to date, the reported side effects of ACK2 have
been mild and transient, including graying of

 mice (18) and reduction of spermatogonia (19). Although both CD47-
blocking therapies and anti–c-Kit antibodies are being independently
investigated in early-phase clinical trials, additional trials will be needed
to assess the safety and feasibility of a combined regimen for patients.
Thus far, CD47 blockade has largely been applied to directing my-
eloid effector responses against cancers. The results presented here
suggest a wider therapeutic application for blockade of the CD47-
SIRPa pathway. The robust synergism between pharmacologic CD47
antagonism and anti–c-Kit antibodies in a syngeneic model provides
strong evidence for the value of using CD47-blocking therapies to in-
crease the cell-depletive capacity of therapeutic antibodies that target
nonmalignant cells. The compelling therapeutic profile that anti–c-Kit
antibodies combined with CD47 antagonism exhibited in allowing
robust HSC engraftment suggests that such targeted therapy could sup-
plant the toxic therapies that have traditionally been used to achieve
HSC replacement in patients with disorders correctable with hemato-
poietic cell transplantations or HSC transplants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein expression and purification
CV1 was expressed and purified from BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells
as previously described (27). For production of CV1mb, the CV1mb
coding sequence was cloned in-frame with an N-terminal GP67 leader
sequence and C-terminal 8× histidine tag into the baculovirus expres-
sion vector pAcGP67. Recombinant CV1mb baculovirus was prepared
in Sf9 cells, and CV1mb protein was expressed by infection of Hi5
cells. Sixty hours after infection, secreted CV1mb was purified from
the culture medium by nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) chroma-
tography. Endotoxin was removed by column washes with Triton
X-114 as previously described. Purified proteins were desalted into
PBS and passed through a sterile 0.22-mm filter.
Production and purification of ACK2 Fab fragments
Intact ACK2 antibody (a gift from S. Nishikawa) was digested using
immobilized papain (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Undigested ACK2 and Fc products were removed by
passage of the reaction mixture over a protein A column, followed
by ion exchange chromatography with a monoQ column. Purified
Fab fragments were desalted into PBS and filtered with a 0.22-mm filter.
Mice
Mice used were 8- to 12-week-old, congenically distinguishable
CD45.1, CD45.2, or CD45.1/CD45.2 C57Bl/6 or C57Bl/6.CD90.1
mice, Rag2−/−cg−/− mice, or Fcer1g−/− mice. All procedures were ap-
proved by the International Animal Care and Use Committee
(protocol #12182). Mouse strains were bred and maintained at Stan-
ford University’s Research Animal Facility.
mCD47 and hCD47 antibody competition assays
For each sample, 1 ml of human or mouse blood was washed with
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS + 0.5 mM
EDTA + 0.5% bovine serum albumin) and incubated with one of a
range of concentrations (indicated in Fig. 3B) of either CV1 or CV1mb
for 60 min on ice. After the samples were washed with FACS buffer to
remove unbound CV1/CV1mb, unoccupied CD47 was detected by
labeling with Alexa 488–conjugated Hu5F9-G4 (15 mg/ml) for human
samples or APC-conjugated MIAP301 (15 mg/ml) (eBioscience) for
murine samples on ice for 20 min. The samples were washed, and anti-
body staining was detected by flow cytometry with an LSRFortessa
(BD). Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star) and fit to sigmoidal
curves using Prism 6 (GraphPad).
Determination of erythrocyte CD47 occupancy from CV1/
CV1mb-treated mice
Mice were treated with 200 mg of CV1 or CV1mb or PBS by intraperi-
toneal injection. One hour before, 1 hour after, and 24 hours after
injection, 20 ml of blood was obtained through tail cut and collected
into 200 ml of PBS with 10 mM EDTA (PBS-EDTA). The erythrocytes
were then washed with FACS buffer and stained with anti-mCD47
antibody MIAP301 conjugated to Alexa 647 at a concentration of
40 mg/ml. Staining proceeded for 40 min on ice; the cells were then washed
with FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry with an LSRFortessa.
Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo, and the percentage of
unoccupied receptors was defined by the quotient of the background-
subtracted MFI of each sample to the background-subtracted MFI in
the absence of CD47 blockade. Data were plotted using Prism 6.
Phagocytosis assays
Human macrophages were differentiated as previously described (27).
Briefly, leukocyte reduction system chambers were obtained from
anonymous blood donors at the Stanford Blood Center. Monocytes
were purified using whole-blood CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi),
followed by separation using an autoMACS Pro Separator (Miltenyi).
Monocytes were differentiated to macrophages by culture in Iscove’s
modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) with GlutaMAX (Thermo
Fisher) plus 10% human AB serum (Gemini), penicillin (100 U/ml),
and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (Thermo Fisher) for 7 to 10 days. Mac-
rophage phagocytosis of GFP+ DLD-1 colon cancer cells was per-
formed as previously described (27). Briefly, 50,000 macrophages
and 100,000 GFP+ DLD-1 cells were cocultured per well of a 96-well
plate and incubated with the given treatments in serum-free IMDM at
37°C for 2 hours. The cell mixtures were then washed with autoMACS
Running Buffer (Miltenyi) and stained with anti-CD45 (BioLegend) to
label macrophages and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) to
assess cell viability. Phagocytosis was determined by flow cytometry as
the percentage of GFP+ macrophages (CD45+ cells) with an LSRFortessa.
Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo and plotted in Prism
6 after normalization as the percentage of maximal phagocytosis. Statis-
tical significance was determined in Prism by two-way analysis of var-
iance (ANOVA) with correction for multiple comparisons.
Complete blood count analysis
Twenty microliters of whole blood per mouse was collected via the tail vein.
Complete blood counts (CBCs) were conducted using Heska HemaTrue
Veterinary Hematology Analyzer. For RBC parameter recovery, C57Bl/
6.CD90.1 mice were treated with either ACK2 (500 mg) or ACK2 (500 mg)
and five daily injections (500 mg each) of anti-CD47 antibody (MIAP410)
and compared to untreated controls. Before ACK2, 400 mg of diphen-
hydramine (APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC) was injected via intra-
peritoneal injection. Day 0 was considered to be the time when the first
injection of ACK2 or ACK2 + MIAP410 was administered. Combination-
treated animals were given whole-blood transfusions (100 ml) from con-
genic animals as supportive care of day 6, 7, 8, and 10 post-ACK2
injection. Mice were bled twice weekly, and CBC analysis was performed.

between live and dead cells. Cells were analyzed on BD LSRII at the
Stanford Shared FACS Facility. Data were analyzed using FlowJo 9.5
(Tree Star). Statistical significance was determined in Prism by two-
way ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons.
Bone marrow transplant
Mice were given retro-orbital injections of one of the following cell
preparations that were resuspended in 100 ml of PBS: lineage-negative
bone marrow cells, sorted LSK HSCs, or whole bone marrow. For
competitive transplantation assays to determine functional HSCs,
whole bone marrow of treated mice was mixed with equal numbers
of congenic support whole bone marrow differing in CD45 allele ex-
pression and transplanted into recipients after lethal radiation was
performed in split dose. Also, for competitive transplants with CV1mb-
and ACK2-treated animals, whole bone marrow of treated mice was
mixed with equal numbers of congenic GFP+ support whole bone mar-
row. For FcR blocking transplants, Rag2−/−cg−/− were given 250 mg of
2.4G2, followed by 500 mg of ACK2 the next day along with 250 mg of
2.4G2 simultaneously. Before ACK2, 400 mg of diphenhydramine (APP
Pharmaceuticals, LLC) was injected via intraperitoneal injection. The
mice were given a total of seven injections of 2.4G2, 48 hours after
the last 2.4G2 injection, 50,000 congenic B6.CD45.1 LSK HSCs were
transplanted for three consecutive days. For ACK2 and CD47 antago-
nist congenic transplants, a single dose (500 mg) of ACK2 on day 0 and
500 mg of CV1mb/CV1/MIAP410 (a gift from I. Weissman) on day 0
followed by four daily injections of 500 mg of CV1mb/CV1/MIAP410
on days 1, 2, 3, and 4. Starting on day 6 after treatment, lineage-depleted
CD45.2+ bone marrow cells were transplanted daily for three consecu-
tive days. For minor mismatch transplants, 50,000 sorted LSK HSCs
were transplanted daily for 3 days. GK1.5 anti-CD4 (100 mg) (Bio X
Cell) and YTS169.4 anti-CD8 (100 mg) (Bio X Cell) were administered
by intraperitoneal injection starting 2 days before transplant for 3 days,
and 4 days after the last transplant, followed by a single injection a week
later, for 2 weeks. For comparison of radiation and ACK2 + CV1mb,
50,000 sorted LSK HSCs were transplanted daily for 3 days, 12 hours
after radiation, or 6 days after initial ACK2 treatment.
Bone marrow histology
Femurs were dissected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin overnight.
Bones were subsequently decalcified using Immunocal (Immunotec). Par-
affin embedding and sectioning were performed by Histo-Tec Laboratory.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software, and P value
was calculated using t test unless otherwise noted. Original data for all
