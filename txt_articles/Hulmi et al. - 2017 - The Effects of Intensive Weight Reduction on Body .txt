Worries about the potential negative consequences of popular fat loss regimens for
aesthetic purposes in normal weight females have been surfacing in the media. However,
longitudinal studies investigating these kinds of diets are lacking. The purpose of the
present study was to investigate the effects of a 4-month fat-loss diet in normal weight
females competing in fitness-sport. In total 50 participants finished the study with 27
females (27.2 ± 4.1 years) dieting for a competition and 23 (27.7 ± 3.7 years) acting as
weight-stable controls. The energy deficit of the diet group was achieved by reducing
carbohydrate intake and increasing aerobic exercise while maintaining a high level of
protein intake and resistance training in addition to moderate fat intake. The diet led
to a ∼12% decrease in body weight (P < 0.001) and a ∼35–50% decrease in fat
mass (DXA, bioimpedance, skinfolds, P < 0.001) whereas the control group maintained
their body and fat mass (diet × group interaction P < 0.001). A small decrease in lean
mass (bioimpedance and skinfolds) and in vastus lateralis muscle cross-sectional area
(ultrasound) were observed in diet (P < 0.05), whereas other results were unaltered
(DXA: lean mass, ultrasound: triceps brachii thickness). The hormonal system was altered
during the diet with decreased serum concentrations of leptin, triiodothyronine (T3),
testosterone (P < 0.001), and estradiol (P < 0.01) coinciding with an increased incidence
of menstrual irregularities (P < 0.05). Body weight and all hormones except T3 and
testosterone returned to baseline during a 3–4 month recovery period including increased
energy intake and decreased levels aerobic exercise. This study shows for the first time
that most of the hormonal changes after a 35–50% decrease in body fat in previously
normal-weight females can recover within 3–4 months of increased energy intake.

Weight Reduction in Fitness Competitors
INTRODUCTION
Many persons lead an active lifestyle aiming to lose body fat with
minimal muscle loss for aesthetic or performance purposes. An
extreme example of these individuals are competitors in different
aesthetic and/or weight class sports (Sundgot-Borgen et al.,
2013). These fat loss regimens are very popular and are shown
regularly in the media in a similar way as diets for the obese
are (Fothergill et al., 2016). Although, worries have arisen about
the negative consequences of these diets on, for example, the
female hormonal system, comprehensive longitudinal weight-
loss studies investigating these diets are lacking on this area,
especially in normal-weight females. This lack of studies is
probably due to ethical reasons and practical constraints as it is
not ethical to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with
normal weight individuals so that the participants would diet as
heavily as needed in these kinds of situations.
A classic Minnesota starvation study in the 1940s investigated
the effects of prolonged and extreme dieting in young previously
normal weights males (Keys et al., 1950; Dulloo et al., 1996). This
type of a long-term semi-starvation experiment would no longer
be possible in civilized countries and thus only much shorter
semi-starvation studies have been conducted, mainly in males
(Alemany et al., 2008; Henning et al., 2014; Müller et al., 2015).
Nevertheless, cross-sectional and longitudinal refeeding studies
have been conducted in females with low energy availability such
as anorexia nervosa or with the female athlete triad. These studies
have shown that prolonged undernutrition is often associated
with low fat and lean mass, decreased bone mineral content,
and other physiological and psychological changes from which
recovery can be very slow and difficult (Sundgot-Borgen et al.,
2013). It is not known how well a normal weight female body can
recover from an energy deficit.
There is a lack of studies in females even though they often
take part in weight reduction ending up in a rather large energy
deficit. For this research question, female fitness competitors are
important as they voluntarily conduct a prolonged heavy diet
concurrent to participating in a large amount of exercise. The aim
of these competitors is to achieve an aesthetic appearance with
symmetry, balance, and muscle “definition” that is accomplished
by low fat mass. These competitors usually compete and thus diet
once per year. Their routine includes a 2–5 month progressive
diet ending up in a state of low energy intake, which is usually
achieved mainly by decreasing carbohydrate and/or fat intake
with maintenance of high protein. Furthermore, exercise volume
is increased to reduce fat mass effectively while maintaining
muscle mass (Helms et al., 2014, 2015). The diet is typically
followed by a recovery period, during which the competitors
increase their energy intake back to baseline. This is quite
a contrast to overweight individuals, who try to maintain
their weight loss, although only rarely that goal is achieved
(Fothergill et al., 2016). Previous weight loss studies with fitness
athletes or bodybuilders have often been case studies using male
bodybuilders (Rossow et al., 2013; Kistler et al., 2014; Robinson
et al., 2015) or they have focused only on body composition,
muscle strength (Sandoval et al., 1989; Bamman et al., 1993; van
der Ploeg et al., 2001), or psychology (Newton et al., 1993). Thus,
physiology, including the hormonal system, has not yet been
comprehensively investigated in a larger group of individuals
following a diet that aims to achieve very low levels of fat mass.
In the present study voluntary fitness-competitors and their
controls are used in a unique research model to investigate
the physiological effects of a demanding 3–4 month period of
dietary energy restriction concurrent with a large amount of
exercise aiming to achieve prolonged negative energy balance. It
is also asked whether a similar 3–4 month period of increased
energy intake is enough to restore endocrine function and body
composition. We hypothesized that (1) fitness-competitors are
able to decrease their body mass mainly by decreasing fat mass
and that (2) the endocrine system is altered, approaching levels
that are typically considered unhealthy if maintained for longer
periods of time, and that (3) the hormonal levels are increased
back to the baseline together with body weight during the
recovery period.
METHODS
Participants
A total of 184 healthy, physically active young females, recruited
by web page and social media advertisements and who claimed
to meet the inclusion criteria volunteered for the study. Out of
the females who fulfilled the preliminary criteria, 63 participants
were planning on competing under the International Federation
of Bodybuilding and Fitness (IFBB) in the year of the study and,
thus, would diet accordingly. In addition, a total of 121 volunteers
were aiming not to diet now, but would probably diet later in
their life or at least try to maintain a fitness lifestyle. An online
pre-study questionnaire was sent to the available 44 diet- and
70 randomly chosen control group candidates that fulfilled the
preliminary requirements for the study (see below). Females, who
were diagnosed with chronic diseases or prescribed medications
such as thyroxine, but excluding contraception, and who were
younger than 20 or older than 38 years old, whose BMI was
below 20 or above 27, or who did not have at least 2 years of
resistance training experience were excluded from the study. As a
result, the diet group competing in the autumn of 2015 consisted
of 30 volunteers. We chose these exclusion criteria because our
aim was to investigate normal-weight healthy previously trained
females. An equal number of control participants were quasi-
randomized by matching based on their age, height, weight,
and training experience reported on the pre-study questionnaire.
The participants selected for the study filled in an additional
questionnaire that was subsequently reviewed by the physician of
our study to confirm that they did not meet the exclusion criteria
relating to health.
All of the diet participants were IFBB amateur fitness
competitors aiming to lose fat, but maintain their muscle mass
in a sport that is tested for prohibited performance enhancing
drugs. Out of these participants, 17 were bikini fitness and 9 body
fitness competitors and 1 was a fitness competitor. These groups
were very similar at the baseline and with regard to the changes
during diet (body composition and hormones, data not shown).

study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations
of Ethical Committee at the University of Jyväskylä with written
informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave written
informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee at the
University of Jyväskylä.
Study Design
The study included 3 test days at the laboratory: baseline
testing before the diet or the control period started (Pre),
after the diet (Mid), and after a refeed recovery period (Post)
during which the participants were advised to continue their
training regimen, but to stop dieting. The control participants
were advised to maintain their activity levels and nutrient
intake throughout the study. The participants were given
identification numbers and the measurement team was blinded
so that they did not know into which group participants
belonged to.
Out of the 30+30 participants eventually 30 volunteers that
would follow the diet (referred to as “diet group” from here on)
and 29 controls arrived to our baseline testing. During the study,
nine females (3 from the diet group and 6 controls) dropped
out. All three drop-outs in the diet group stopped dieting due
to failing to follow the diet program whereas controls either
were not able to follow the control period or for some unknown
reason finished the study. This resulted in 50 participants (27
dieters and 23 controls) overall finishing the whole study. The
diet group (n = 27) was on average 27.2 ± 4.1 years old and
the controls 27.7 ± 3.7 years old. The length of the diet-period
for the diet group was 19.8 ± 3.6 weeks while the recovery
period was 17.5 ± 2.6 weeks. The length of the respective control
periods were 22.4 ±5.0 and 19.2 ± 5.3 weeks, respectively.
Figure 1A depicts the study design and two females from each
group.
For 15 of the competitors, this was their first competition
diet and the rest of the diet group (n = 12) had been dieting
for competitions between 1 and 4 times. Three of the 27
of the diet group participants were competing at the world
championship level, while the rest competed in the Finnish
National championships or in the qualification rounds.
Three Test Days
The participants came to the laboratory from all over the Finland.
If they traveled >50 km to our laboratory, they were provided
with a hotel room for the night prior to testing. Figure 1B
depicts the measurement day of the participant in the laboratory.
The participants came to the tests after 8 h of fasting and
the first measurements (blood sampling, DXA, bioimpedance)
were conducted before a quick standardized low-fat breakfast (a
protein-drink, a protein bar and a medium-sized apple/banana:
in total ∼47–48 g proteins, ∼72–80 g carbohydrates, ∼6 g fat).
Thereafter, ultrasound, skinfolds, blood pressure, and muscle
strength measurements were conducted. The breakfast was
especially important in the measurements after the diet since
some of the participants were in a large energy deficit and
potentially not able to perform, for example, muscle strength
testing in a reliable and safe manner. The mid measurement
day after the diet was conducted the morning after the
competition.
All the measurements were conducted at the same time
(always within max ±1 h) due to the importance of standardizing
the time of the day of measurements. The control group
participants were measured on the same days as the competitors.
The same researcher/research assistant was always responsible
for conducting the measurements and analysis to avoid
interobserver/-analyzer variability. The participants were asked
to sleep for at least 8 h during the preceding night and were
required to refrain from strenuous physical activity for at
least 24 h.
Resistance and Aerobic Training
The resistance training background of the participants was 3.5
± 1.4 years in the diet group and 3.1 ± 1.1 years in the
control group. The participants trained with their own training
programs and they were asked to provide their training diaries
throughout the study period. The training frequency, intensity
and volume were calculated from the diaries. Total exercise
metabolic equivalents in hours (MET-hours) were calculated
based on recommendations (Ainsworth et al., 2000).
Split routines were used for resistance training by all
competitors in the diet group meaning that they focused on
single muscle groups per session as is often the case also in
bodybuilders (Hackett et al., 2013). The main muscle groups
trained included thighs, hamstrings, buttocks, chest, shoulders,
arms, upper and lower back, calves, and abdominals. Dividing
training into separate body parts per session did not differ
significantly throughout the training. At baseline the 3-, 4-, 5-,
and 6-split training was used by 3, 10, 13, and 1 of the 27
participants, respectively, while the same numbers were during
the diet on average 5, 8, 14, and 0 and during the recovery period
7, 8, 12, and 0. In addition, the competitors also practiced their
posing routines. Training sessions lasted between 40 and 90 min.
Aerobic training for the participants was almost uniquely
either high-intensity interval training (HIT) with bicycle,
crosstrainer, or other gym equipment or both HIT and steady-
state low to medium intensity aerobics (usually walking/running
or with crosstrainer). During the competition week the
participants did not report doing HIT, but instead lower
intensity aerobics. Typical HIT-exercise was 10–25 min in
total including high intensity 15–45 s intervals with 30–60 s of
recovery between the sets. Steady state lower intensity aerobics
was typically 30–60 min in duration. Part of the females
completed their aerobic training mainly together with their
resistance exercise workouts while most of the participants
completed also separate aerobic workouts, especially during the
diet.
At the last week of a typical fitness or bodybuilding diet there
is a tapering period during which total training load is typically
slightly decreased and carbohydrate and total energy intakes
are increased toward the baseline levels. This is conducted to
replenish muscle glycogen stores and, thus, prevent an artificial
decrease in muscle size that occurs with low carbohydrate diets
as ∼2.7 g of water per each gram of glycogen is stored in skeletal
muscle.

during which the participants decreased their energy intake and the amount of exercise (see the Results Section), whereas the controls maintained their activity levels

Nutrient Intake
The participants maintained their diet during the diet phase.
About 50% percent of the participants reported all their
meals to the investigators. The rest of the participants
had a more flexible diet or did not share all the details
of
their
diet,
but,
instead
reported
representative
days
throughout the diet. The controls kept their dietary diary
over 3 weekdays and 1 weekend day at the baseline, in
the middle of the study and during the last part of the
study. Nutrients provided by nutritional supplements were
included in the analysis. The food diaries were analyzed by
nutrient analysis software (Aivodiet, Flow-team Oy, Oulu,
Finland).
Body Composition
DXA
Body
composition
was
estimated
by
Dual-energy
X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA, Lunar Prodigy Advance, GE Medical
Systems—Lunar, Madison WI USA) using methods similar to
Hulmi et al. (2015) in a fasted state. Participants were tested
on their back in a supine position on the DXA table with their
arms at their sides and feet together with minimal clothing (i.e.,
a pair of shorts). The legs were secured by non-elastic straps
at the knee and ankles, and the arms were aligned along the
trunk with the palms facing the thighs. All metal objects were
removed from the participant before the scan. Analysis (using
enCORE 2005, version 9.30 and Advance 12.30) provided total,
lean (bone-free), bone, and fat masses. The android region
is the area between the ribs and the pelvis within the trunk
region (the upper part of the trunk) and correlates with visceral
fat measures (Hill et al., 2007; Miazgowski et al., 2014). High
levels of visceral fat mass are strongly associated with metabolic
abnormalities (Kang et al., 2011). The gynoid area defined by
the software is a region including the sex organs and lower-part
of the hips (Miazgowski et al., 2014). In a previous study in our
laboratory the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the
body composition measures were 0.786–0.975 (Schumann et al.,
2014).

Bioimpedance
After an overnight fast, body fat percentage, fat, and lean masses
were measured by bioelectrical impedance using an InBody720
machine with a multifrequency current (Seoul, Korea).
Skinfolds
Skinfold thicknesses were analyzed with Harpender calibers
from four sites: biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac and
replicated at least three times. Fat percentage was calculated with
a formula (Durnin and Womersley, 1974) while total fat mass and
fat-free masses were calculated by subtraction from body mass.
Ultrasound for Muscle Cross-Sectional
Area and Thickness and Subcutaneous Fat
Thickness
Cross-sectional area (CSA) of the vastus lateralis muscle was
examined at the mid-thigh by extended field of view mode using
a B-mode axial plane ultrasound (model SSD-α10, Aloka, Tokyo,
Japan) using a 10 MHz linear-array probe (60 mm width) with
the extended-field-of-view mode (23 Hz sampling frequency).
The CSA of the vastus lateralis muscle was determined from
two levels: the first was exactly 40% from the superior point of
patella toward anterior superior spina iliaca and the second 2
cm distally from the first level. The thickness of subcutaneous fat
in the thigh was examined from the 40% line mentioned above,
but at the medial-lateral axis at the border of vastus lateralis
and rectus femoris. The thickness of triceps brachii muscle and
subcutaneous fat were measured at exactly the midpoint between
medial epicondyle and acromion. A customized convex-shaped
probe support coated with water-soluble transmission gel was
used to assure a perpendicular measurement and to constantly
distribute pressure on the tissue. For CSA, the transducer was
moved manually from medial to lateral along a marked line
on the skin. Three images were scanned from each lines (CSA)
and measurement point (thicknesses). CSA and thicknesses
were analyzed manually using ImageJ software (version 1.44p;
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The average values
were used for the statistical analyses. The panoramic ultrasound
method has been shown by us to be very reliable and valid
against magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect resistance
training-induced change in muscle CSA in our laboratory, e.g.,
ICC > 0.9 and high limits of agreement by Bland Altman method
(Ahtiainen et al., 2010). Also for subcutaneous fat thickness intra-
assay CV and reliability for this method are high (Müller et al.,
2016).
Maximal and Explosive Strength
In the beginning of the actual measurements, the participants
were carefully familiarized with the test procedures and
techniques. The participants had a general warm up (body-
weight 1- and 2-legged squats and hand rotations) after
which several warm-up trials were performed on each test
device. A horizontal leg press extension dynamometer (custom
built: Department of Biology of Physical Activity, University
of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland) was used to determine
maximal isometric bilateral leg press force (maximal voluntary
contraction, MVC). In the leg press, the participants were seated
with a hip and knee angle of 110◦ and 107◦, respectively. Maximal
leg extension force was analyzed by a customized script (Signal
4.04, Cambridge Electronic Design, UK). Maximal isometric
bilateral bench press for the upper-body strength (MVC) was
measured in a smith-machine and the bar was locked to the
position with the elbow angle of 90◦ (Ojasto and Häkkinen,
2009). The subject was in a supine position on the bench and
pushed against the fixed bar. The test position including the
wideness of the grip was standardized throughout the study.
The maximum force was measured by the force plates under
the bench using a customized script (Signal 4.04, Cambridge
Electronic Design, UK). In these isometric tests, the participants
were instructed to produce maximal force on verbal command
and to maintain their maximal force plateau for 3–4 s while
being verbally encouraged. Maximal explosive strength of the
hip and knee extensors was measured using a vertical counter
movement jump (Komi and Bosco, 1978) on a custom-built
infrared contact mat (Department of Biology of Physical activity,
University of Jyväskylä). The height of rise of the center of gravity
was calculated from the flight time. The subjects were instructed
to perform a quick and explosive countermovement and to jump
as high as possible while their hands were on the hips throughout
the action. In each strength test 3 maximal trials were conducted
with recovery periods of 1 min in the isometric tests and 0.5 min
in the jump test. Up to two additional trials were performed if the
result during the last trial was greater by 5% compared with that
during the previous attempt. The trial with the highest result was
used for statistical analysis.
Blood Pressure and Heart Rate
The participants were seated in a quiet room and after resting
their blood pressure and heart rate (pulse) was measured using
calibrated Omron M6 automatic blood pressure monitor with
appropriate cuff size (Omron R6, Omron Healthcare, Kyoto,
Japan). The measurements were conducted three times and the
average was selected as the final result.
Venous Blood Sampling and Analysis
Venous blood samples were taken from the antecubital vein into
serum tubes (Venosafe; Terumo Medical Co., Leuven, Hanau,
Belgium) using standard laboratory procedures. Whole blood
was immediately analyzed (Sysmex XP 300 analyzator Sysmex
Inc, Kobe, Japan) for hemoglobin and hematocrit. Blood samples
for hormone analysis were stored in room temperature for 30
min, after which they were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10
min (Megafure 1.0 R Heraeus; DJB Lab Care, Germany). Free
thyroxine (T4), free triiodothyronine (T3), thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH), cortisol, testosterone, estradiol were analyzed
from serum by Immulite 2000 XPi immunoassay system
(Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). Serum leptin was
analyzed by Dynex Ds 2 ELISA prosessing System (DYNEX
Technologies, Chantilly, VA, USA) using a commercial kit
(Human leptin ELISA, BioVendor, Heidelberg, Germany). These
hormones are routinely analyzed in our laboratory and day-to
day reliability (CV%) for all of these hormones in our laboratory
is <8%.

Profile of Moods (POMS) and Reproductive
Function Questionnaires
Mood and menstrual bleeding was asked by the questionnaires
at pre time-point, in the middle of the pre and mid timepoints
and the week before the mid- and post measurements. The
participant’s mood was examined using the Finnish version
(Vuoskoski and Eerola, 2011) of the Profile of Mood States-
Adolescents questionnaire (POMS-A; Terry et al., 1999). The 24
items of the POMS, designed to measure six moods of Vigor,
Confusion, Anger, Fatigue, Depression, and Tension, were rated
on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = not at all to 5 =
extremely.
Menstrual/reproductive function questionnaire involves yes
or no answers to the following questions: Have you had some
of these menstrual irregularities within the last 2 months: 1:
menstrual cycle has become irregular, 2: menstrual bleeding
has decreased, 3: menstrual bleeding has increased, and 4: no
menstrual bleeding.
Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as means ± SD, except where designated.
Normality,
skewness
and
possible
outliers
were
checked
with the Shapiro–Wilk test and several plots. Data was
analyzed with the repeated ANOVA (time × group) with
contrasts.
Logarithm
transformations
were
applied
when
needed
to
normalize
variables
or
to
homogenize
group
variances. If assumptions for parametric tests were not met
even with transformations, nonparametric tests (Friedman’s
test, Sign test and Mann–Whitney test) were utilized, and
variables
were
RANK-transformed
for
the
estimation
of
interaction term (time × group in parametric ANOVA).
Average percentage changes between groups were tested with
the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test due to deviations
from normality and outliers. Holm–Bonferroni was used
to manually correct for the multi-tests between individual
time-points between the groups and within the groups.
IBM
SPSS
for
Windows
22.0
(Armonk
NY,
2013)
was
utilized for statistical analyses. Significance level was set
as 0.05.
RESULTS
Nutrition
The energy intake during the diet was on average 22.9 ±
13.8% (p < 0.001) lower than before the diet, while the
energy intake of the control group remained unaltered (Table 1).
The decreased energy intake in the diet group was mainly
explained by reduced carbohydrate ingestion. Although, absolute
protein and fat intake slightly decreased, these values were
explained by decreased weight and, thus, per kg of body
mass only very slight decrease in fat and no changes in
protein intake was noticed (Table 1). Actually, the relative
protein intake (% of total energy) increased (p < 0.001) and
relative CHO intake decreased (p < 0.01), while relative fat
intake remained unaltered (Supplementary Table 1). During the
recovery energy intake of the participants returned to baseline
levels.
Exercise
The training frequencies and MET-hours of the participants
are shown in Table 2. The participants resistance trained 4.7
± 0.7 (diet group) and 3.9 ± 1.9 (controls) times per week at
the time of the pre-measurements. The diet group maintained
their resistance training frequency during the diet, during the
competition week and during the recovery period. However,
when taking into account the reported length and intensity of
their resistance exercise bouts, the MET-hours of the participants
decreased during the competition week (p < 0.001), probably
due to the tapering period fitness-competitors have before the
competition. The controls maintained their resistance training
frequencies and MET-hours throughout the study period. Lower
body muscles were trained during the diet 1.4 ± 0.5 times per
week and specific upper body muscle groups 1.1 ± 0.3 times per
week in a split design. Unlike resistance training, the diet group
increased their aerobic training during the diet (4.9 ± 2.9 times
per week) when compared to pre-state (3.6 ± 2.8; P < 0.05 and
diet × group interaction p = 0.013). This was due to the increased
amount of steady state aerobics in several subjects, while part of
the participants also started to conduct or increased the amount
of HIT-exercises. The level of aerobic training decreased during
the recovery period in these participants down to 2.3 ± 1.9 times
per week while the controls maintained their levels of aerobic
training.
Body Composition
Body
composition
was
examined
with
many
indirect
measurements [DXA, bioimpedance (InBody) and skinfolds]
as well as direct measures (ultrasound) as the diet itself may
distort some of the assumptions of individual body composition
measurements or their formulas used. There was group × time
interaction (p < 0.001) in body mass and fat mass independent
of the method used (DXA, skinfolds, bioimpedance; Table 3)
as well as in fat thickness (Figures 2A,B; ultrasound). These
were explained by the fact that the body and fat mass of
the diet group participants decreased during the diet and
returned almost completely (body mass) or partially (fat
mass and thickness) to the baseline after the recovery period.
No change of these parameters was observed in the control
group (Table 3). This resulted in a decrease in fat % by diet
on average from 23.1 ± 5.6 to 12.7 ± 4.0% (DXA), from
19.7 ± 4.2 to 11.6 ± 3.9% (bioimpedance), and from 25.2
± 3.0 to 18.3 ± 2.7% (skinfolds). From these values, fat %
increased during the recovery period to 20.1 ± 5.4%, 18.0 ±
4.5%, and 25.9 ± 4.1% based on DXA, bioimpedance, and
skinfold
measurements,
respectively.
Regarding
individual
areas, the android region in DXA reflecting visceral fat
decreased ∼68% in the diet group (p < 0.001) and then
recovered toward baseline and controls (Table 3). Similarly,
fat in the gynoid area decreased by diet 44.2 ± 12.8% (p
< 0.001) followed by an increase close to the pre-values
during the recovery period (post–pre: −9.4 ± 19.5%, p <
0.05) while remaining unaltered in the controls (diet × group
interaction p < 0.001).
Unlike body mass and fat mass, diet or the recovery period
did not significantly alter lean mass measured by DXA. There

of the diet group had a small increase in their lean mass (average
of DXA and bioimpedance) while most of them had a decrease or
no change (Figure 2E).

Total bone mass tended to have group × time interaction (p
= 0.10), which was explained by a decrease in bone mass during
diet (p < 0.001) while no change was observed in the controls (p
> 0.3; Table 3).
Maximal and Explosive Strength
Isometric maximal strength and explosive strength of leg
extensors remained unchanged during diet and there was no
difference compared to controls (group × time interaction
p > 0.1; Table 4). However, isometric bench press decreased
during the diet when compared to control participants (p < 0.05;
Table 4).
Hormones
There was group × time interaction in serum concentrations
of leptin, testosterone, T3 (p < 0.001), and estradiol (p <
0.01; Figures 3A–D). This was shown as decreases in these
hormones due to the diet when compared to the control
group. Leptin and estradiol (Figures 3A,C) increased back to
baseline while T3 (Figures 3D, 4) and testosterone (Figure 3B)
remained slightly, but significantly below the baseline even after
the recovery period. No changes to the controls at the post
timepoints were, however observed. T4 showed an increase due
to diet and a reduction back to baseline during the recovery
period, but these changes were small and non-significant in
comparison to controls (Figure 3E). No treatment × time
interaction was observed in TSH and cortisol (p > 0.19,
Figures 3F,G).
Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Hemoglobin,
and Hematocrit
Systolic blood pressure showed a group × time interaction (p

pressure (p = 0.177) (Table 5). The post-hoc analysis showed that
diet led to decreased systolic blood pressure (p < 0.001), which
remained decreased after the recovery period, when compared

post-hoc analysis showed that diet decreased hemoglobin (p <

Menstrual Irregularities
The baseline values for the missing menses in the diet-
participants was 11.1% (3/27) and for irregularities in menstrual
bleeding 37.0% (10/27) while in the controls the same values were
and 4.3% (1/23) and 30.4% (7/23) without differences between
the groups (p > 0.6). Fisher’s exact test revealed that the diet
group had more (63%) irregular menstrual bleeding than controls
(30%; p < 0.05) and tended to have more missing menses (44 vs.
22%, p = 0.082) during the diet than the controls during their
weight-maintenance period (measurement-points in the middle
of the diet or after the diet before the competition). After the
recovery period at post, in the diet group 28% (7/25) females
had no menstrual bleeding and in the controls the respective
value was 14.0% (3/22; p = 0.297). For those competitors
using estrogen containing contraception (n = 19) there were
irregularities in menstrual bleeding during the diet in 10/19
participants and/or lack of menstruation in 8/19 participants (at
baseline 8/19 and 2/19, respectively). On the other hand, those
subjects not using estrogen containing contraception (n = 5),
5/5 demonstrated irregular menstrual bleeding during the diet
and/or lack of menstruation in 3/5 participants (at baseline 2/5
and 1/5, respectively). Three subjects did not report whether they
used contraception medication or not.
Mood
There was no statistically significant changes in the mood of the
participants within the diet group or between the diet and control
groups at any of the time-points (Supplementary Table 2). The
only statistical trend was a slight decrease in the vigor of the
competitors (p = 0.066) in the middle of the diet when compared
to the changes in the control group participants.
DISCUSSION
The present study showed that a diet to achieve very low
levels of body fat can be completed with very small losses of
lean mass/muscle size and muscle function in normal weight
females with high levels of protein intake and resistance exercise.
Moreover, the endocrine system is altered during the diet, but is
recovered in most of the females following a recovery period of
3–4 months that includes increased energy intake together with
the recovery of body weight.
Previous studies with energy deficits in otherwise normal
weight

various
results
in
body
composition. In the classic Minnesota starvation study body
mass decreased in males on average by 25% with lean mass
representing 6–28% (mean ∼15%), and the rest being fat (Keys
et al., 1950; Dulloo et al., 1996). On the other hand, fat-free
mass showed only a small decrease during a diet in female
bodybuilders (van der Ploeg et al., 2001). There are a few possible
explanations why lean mass and muscle size were maintained
in the present study. First, the proportion of lean mass loss
during diet has been larger the smaller the initial body fat% was
(Dulloo et al., 1996; Huovinen et al., 2015). In the present study,
females had an average 19–25% of fat (depending on whether
DXA, bioimpedance, or skinfolds was used) at baseline, which
is relatively high in comparison to e.g., ∼14% of fat in the male
participants of the Minnesota study (Keys et al., 1950; Dulloo
et al., 1996). Second, studies have shown that during energy
deficit lean mass can be better maintained with ≥1.7–2 g/kg
body weight per day protein ingestion in males and females
(Mettler et al., 2010; Josse et al., 2011; Arciero et al., 2013;
Churchward-Venne et al., 2013; Pasiakos et al., 2013; Longland
et al., 2016). In our study cohort of fitness-competitors the
protein content remained high, on average 3 g/kg even during
the energy deficit. Third, resistance and aerobic training have
been shown to attenuate the loss of lean mass during energy
deficit when compared to energy restriction alone (Kraemer
et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2013), which were both also used
during the diet by the present fitness competitors. Moreover,
the changes in body weight of the diet group were rather slow,
on average ∼0.4 g/kg per week, which is actually pretty close to
the level that was previously observed to maintain lean mass in
normal-weight females on a diet (Mero et al., 2010) and what
has been recommended for fat loss in fitness diets (Helms et al.,
2014). The average participant, while resistance trained, had not

had many years of training experience (average 3.5 ± 1.4 years in
the diet group and 3.1 ± 1.2 years in the controls), which makes
it possible for some to even gain some muscle mass on a diet
when regularly conducting resistance training combined with
high protein intake (Josse et al., 2011; Longland et al., 2016).
It is also important to recognize that the last week of a typical
fitness or bodybuilding diet includes tapering of training, which
was observed as decreased MET-hours of resistance training and
similar to baseline carbohydrate eating. This makes lean mass
and muscle sizes after diet more comparable when compared to
baseline. When this is not taken into account in diet studies in
which carbohydrates are restricted, small 1–3 kg losses in lean
mass may just be glycogen and water losses instead of an actual
decrease in protein mass.
Out of the present serum hormones investigated the
concentration of leptin robustly decreased but recovered close to
baseline levels after the recovery period following energy intake
and fat mass as expected (Kelesidis et al., 2010). Decreased leptin
after diet has orexigenic effects in response to energy deficiency
and in decreased fat mass (Kelesidis et al., 2010) and may be one
of the reasons why maintaining low energy intake and energy
deficit for a long time has been shown to be psychologically very
difficult (Keys et al., 1950). In our study, only a few of the females
had leptin levels <3 ng/ml (6 of 27 diet-participants) after the
diet, a level thought to be a low-limit for many physiological
changes in females such as decreased immune function (Chan
et al., 2006). This state was reversed by the recovery period as
serum leptin levels did recover to ≥3 ng/ml levels in all females.
This is important as recovery of leptin can in itself restore,
for instance, ovulatory menstrual cycles and improve levels of
reproductive and thyroid hormones as well as bone markers in
amenorrhea (Rosenbaum et al., 2002; Kelesidis et al., 2010).
Weight reduction in obese or overweight individuals typically
decreases T3 while T4 and TSH usually remain unaltered
(Fothergill et al., 2016). We now showed that also in normal
weight to thin individuals, weight loss from mainly fat stores
decreases only T3 and not T4 and TSH. This is also supported by
data from individuals with anorexia nervosa who have lowered
serum leptin and T3, together with low fat mass (Tolle et al.,
2003). These hormones are usually at least partially recovered
toward the values of normal-weight individuals after weight gain
(Tolle et al., 2003). Individual T3 levels were also compared to
the reference values. For T3, in dieters, 5/27 were below the
reference values (2.6–6 pmol/L) at pre, 20/27 after the diet and
13/27 at recovery while in controls the number of participants
was 5/23, 8/23, and 7/23, respectively (Figure 3). Statistically
significantly lowered T3 at the post time-point suggests that 3–4
months of recovery may not be enough in some individuals after
heavy energy deficit. These females should probably continue
the recovery period of increased energy intake before dieting
again for the competition to avoid longer term changes in
their hormonal balance. This is because in addition to possible
health risks, decreased T3 can lead to decreased metabolic rate
(Kim, 2008). The decrease and only a partial recovery of T3
was accompanied by the decreased heart rate and systolic blood
pressure. Similarly as T3, heart rate also remained decreased after
the recovery period. Together with decreased fat mass, decreased
blood pressure and heart rate are typical responses after a diet,
even for normotensive and non-overweight individuals (Keys
et al., 1950; Awazu et al., 2000; Rossow et al., 2013) showing that
the autonomic nervous system also adapts to an energy deficit as
expected and, thus, may not be a health risk at these levels of heart
rate of ≥49 bpm in all females. However, when the heart rate is
more substantially decreased and long lasting such as in anorectic
individuals without supervised and controlled refeeding, this can
lead to a long QT in ECG and an increased risk for arrhytmia
(Sachs et al., 2016).
Anorectic females have very low serum estradiol (Tolle et al.,
2003) and testosterone (Miller et al., 2007). Not surprisingly, in
the present study, serum sex-hormones estradiol and testosterone
both decreased during the diet. In addition, estradiol, but not
testosterone, recovered at or close to baseline levels within 3–
4 months of recovery. This suggests that recovery of serum
testosterone in females takes longer time and/or larger energy
intake and/or fat mass when compared to estradiol. It is
unknown whether the levels observed in the present study are
physiologically meaningful as the mean values are within normal
values of serum testosterone in most of the participants (Haring
et al., 2012) and the measured loss of muscle size was very small.
However, higher serum testosterone levels in females have been
associated with larger lean mass to fat mass ratio (Rickenlund
et al., 2003) and occasionally correlation between gains in muscle

cross-sectional area and/or strength during resistance training
have also been observed (Häkkinen et al., 1992). Interestingly,
a slightly decreased bone mass by DXA was observed in diet,
increasing back to baseline after the recovery period. The result
may be due to the direct effects of decreased body and muscle
mass on mechanical forces (Goodman et al., 2015), decreased
energy availability (Ihle and Loucks, 2004) and/or lowered
estradiol and testosterone that are both anabolic to bone based
on some (Davis et al., 1995), but not all studies (Muñoz et al.,
2002).
Some studies have suggested that for optimal health,
minimum body fat for females would be within the range of
12–14% (Meyer et al., 2013), but this depends on the individual
and the body composition assessment method. BMI decreased
from 23.5 ± 1.8 to 20.6 ± 1.4 recovering to 22.9 ± 2.0 while
the lowest BMI’s after the diet were 18.7–19.0 in four females.
On the other hand, 6/27 females had <10% body fat after the
diet in both DXA and in bioimpedance. In many sports such
as in distance running, figure skating and gymnastics fat % in
females can be as low as 10–15% and in some females even below
10% almost year round (Wilmore et al., 1977). Instead, in fitness-
competitors, fat percentage is usually kept at low levels only for
a rather short period of time. Indeed, none of the participants
had <10% levels after the recovery period, while levels of 15–
20% were frequent. This may, in theory, offer a health protection.
Weight cycling, i.e., repeated cycles of weight loss and regain that
are observed in those who frequently compete and thus diet may,
however, predispose to some health risks such as obesity in some
groups of people (Saarni et al., 2006), although the total weight of
evidence is very weak (Mehta et al., 2014). Nevertheless, females
need a higher fat percentage than males because of the endocrine
function that is necessary for ovulation and maintenance of
bone mass. Indeed, in the present study, more dieting females
reported changes in their menstrual function during their diet
than controls in their control period. The values reported are
not unexpected as menstrual dysfunction is very common among
many thin female athletes (Melin et al., 2015). These results
are probably related, in part, to changes in fat mass around
visceral and genital areas. In the present study the estimation
of visceral fat measured as an android region mass by DXA
showed a substantial ∼68% decrease followed by an increase
back to the pre-values after the recovery period. A recent meta-
analysis suggests that in negative energy balance, both exercise
and diet reduce fat mass, but exercise may be more important
to reduce visceral adipose tissue (Verheggen et al., 2016). The
decrease in fat in these areas combined with energy deficit can,
in theory, signal the hypothalamus-pituitary axis to decrease
secretion of hormones relating to ovulation such as estradiol
and eventually, to transiently stop ovulation and menstrual
bleeding.
Even though muscle strength is not essential for fitness
competition performance per se, it may be, in theory, important
to maintain muscle strength for the purposes of resistance
training adaptations. In the present study, the participants
maintained their maximal isometric muscle strength and
explosive strength of leg extensors during the diet. This
can be explained, in part by maintenance of muscle size
in the important knee extensor muscles investigated and by
frequent heavy intensity resistance training that was maintained
throughout the study, which can sustain or improve voluntary
activation of muscles even in strength trained female athletes
(Häkkinen and Kallinen, 1994). However, a measure of upper-
body strength, isometric bench press, decreased during diet
when compared to controls suggesting that during the diet
especially the upper-body strength may be difficult to maintain
due to energy/carbohydrate deficit with a typical training
program of fitness athletes. This was observed even though
the thickness of triceps brachii muscle, which is one of the

main muscles responsible for the bench press strength, remained
unaltered during the diet. Previously, Bamman et al. (1993)
noticed a decrease in isometric strength after a bodybuilding
diet in males while Rossow et al. (2013) reported decreased
absolute, but not relative levels of muscle strength and Robinson
et al. (2015) reported no changes in most of the isokinetic
measures of maximal strength in a male bodybuilder after
the diet.
Mentally, maintaining rather a large energy deficit can be
hard, possibly especially for those who are dieting toward very
low body fat levels as observed previously in bodybuilders on
a competition diet (Newton et al., 1993). Perhaps surprisingly,
the present fitness-diet did not markedly affect the mood
state of the participants. Supporting the mood results, serum
cortisol did not increase following the diet. This was also a bit
surprising considering that in stressful situations such as energy
restriction and monitoring calories, serum cortisol level often
increase (Tomiyama et al., 2010). However, a slight decrease
in the vigor of the participants (P = 0.066) was observed in
the middle of the diet when compared to the changes in the
control group participants. This suggest that some individuals
on the diet may have felt less active, lively, and/or energetic
when compared to their baseline levels than individuals in the
control group. This supports the earlier case-study with male
drug-free bodybuilder (Rossow et al., 2013). The reason why
the results were not very consistent may be explained, in part,
by the fact that the participants were voluntarily taking part in
the diet, which makes the situation different compared to a full
randomized trial without a clear “reward” (competition) at the
end.
The present study had several strengths. The n-size of the
study was rather large and a control group was included, which
is quite rare in energy deficit—refeeding studies. In addition,
the comprehensive analysis of body composition with direct
measures of muscle and fat size can be regarded as a strength. On
the other hand, the study was limited in the experimental design
that it was not randomized. However, we think that a similar
background of the groups enables us to compare the changes
in the diet group to almost an identical group of the controls
not changing their nutrition or exercise during the experimental
period. The physiology and body composition measurements
were taken after a competition and not a week before the
“peak” week. This is, however, in our view also an advantage
as mentioned above at least regarding the body composition
measurements. Contraceptive medication use did not result in
exclusion from the study. In the present study the majority
(19) of the competitors reported using estrogen-containing
contraception and five not. While we acknowledge that in
addition to the variation in the phase of the menstrual cycle,
also oral contraception use can have effects and thus add extra
variation on the measured variables. We analyzed the changes in
serum estradiol from pre to mid and from mid to post and those
remained significant in the estrogen containing contraception
users and in non-users (p < 0.05) similarly as shown with
all the subjects pooled (data not shown). Unfortunately the
n-size is too small to conduct a valid statistical analysis for
the menstrual irregularities, but our data tends to suggests that
those who do not use estrogen containing medication may
be slightly more vulnerable to menstrual irregularities during
the diet than those who use them. However, this question
needs to be addressed with studies using larger n-size in the
future.
In conclusion, a fitness diet in healthy young females
accomplished
by
restricting
carbohydrate
ingestion
and
increasing aerobic exercise while maintaining high levels
of protein intake and resistance exercise can be carried out
without major decreases in lean mass/muscle size. Therefore,
the diet almost exclusively decreased body fat and altered serum
hormones, but most of those values recovered within 3–4 months
with the increase in energy intake and decrease in high level of
aerobic exercise. However, in some females this time period may
not have been long enough for a full recovery (e.g., free T3 and
testosterone hormones). Future studies should investigate the
time-course of the changes during the diet and in the recovery
period and whether repeating heavy diets for many times has any
long-lasting negative effects.
