Summary
Background Male circumcision is being widely deployed as an HIV prevention strategy in countries with high HIV 
incidence, but its uptake in sub-Saharan Africa has been below targets. We did a study to establish whether educating 
religious leaders about male circumcision would increase uptake in their village.
Methods In this cluster randomised trial in northwest Tanzania, eligible villages were paired by proximity (<60 km) 
and the time that a free male circumcision outreach campaign from the Tanzanian Ministry of Health became 
available in their village. All villages received the standard male circumcision outreach activities provided by the 
Ministry of Health. Within the village pairs, villages were randomly assigned by coin toss to receive either additional 
education for Christian church leaders on scientific, religious, and cultural aspects of male circumcision (intervention 
group), or standard outreach only (control group). Church leaders or their congregations were not masked to random 
assignment. The educational intervention consisted of a 1-day seminar co-taught by a Tanzanian pastor and a 
Tanzanian clinician who worked with the Ministry of Health, and meetings with the study team every 2 weeks 
thereafter, for the duration of the circumcision campaign. The primary outcome was the proportion of male 
individuals in a village who were circumcised during the campaign, using an intention-to-treat analysis that included 
all men in the village. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 02167776.
Findings Between June 15, 2014, and Dec 10, 2015, we provided education for church leaders in eight intervention 
villages and compared the outcomes with those in eight control villages. In the intervention villages, 52∙8% 
(30 889 of 58 536) of men were circumcised compared with 29∙5% (25 484 of 86 492) of men in the eight control 
villages (odds ratio 3∙2 [95% CI, 1∙4–7∙3]; p=0∙006).
Interpretation Education of religious leaders had a substantial effect on uptake of male circumcision, and should be 
considered as part of male circumcision programmes in other sub-Saharan African countries. This study was 
conducted in one region in Tanzania; however, we believe that our intervention is generalisable. We equipped church 
leaders with knowledge and tools, and ultimately each leader established the most culturally-appropriate way to 
promote male circumcision. Therefore, we think that the process of working through religious leaders can serve as an 
innovative model to promote healthy behaviour, leading to HIV prevention and other clinically relevant outcomes, in 
a variety of settings.

Introduction
Evidence in support of male circumcision as an HIV 
prevention strategy among heterosexual men was the 
subject of a Cochrane Database systematic review1 in 2009. 
The review by Siegfried and colleagues1 cited three major 
randomised controlled trials, done in South Africa,2 
Kenya,3 and Uganda4 between 2002 and 2006. All three 
trials were stopped early when the group randomised to 
receive male circumcision was found to have a dramatic 
reduction in HIV incidence within the first 12–24 months. 
The systematic review estimated a risk reduction 
between 38% and 66% over this period. In light of these 
compelling findings, WHO recommends5 widespread 
implementation of voluntary medical male circumcision 
for HIV prevention in countries with generalised HIV 
epidemics and a low prevalence of male circumcision. 
In 2011, 14 target countries in sub-Saharan Africa were 
prioritised for scale-up of male circumcision, with a goal 
of achieving national male circumcision rates of 80%, 
requiring 20·8 million circumcisions by 2016.6 However, 
uptake has been about 50% lower than predicted, with 
only 10 million circumcisions done by the end of 2015.5
The practice of male circumcision is imbued with 
religious significance in many cultures, and religious 
beliefs remain major impediments to the acceptance of 
male circumcision in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa.7–9 
In our previous work in the Mwanza region of northwest 
Tanzania, Christian church attenders expressed concern 
that male circumcision was a Muslim practice and 
that male circumcision programmes offered by the 
Tanzanian Government were attempts to convert them.7 
Other common Christian viewpoints were that male

circumcision is a practice only for the sexually 
promiscuous and that Christians should focus on so-
called circumcision of the heart rather than their physical 
bodies. Because of these beliefs, many Tanzanian 
Christians questioned whether male circumcision was 
compatible with their faith.
Churches and other religious organisations exert 
formative influence on the beliefs and behaviours of a 
large majority of people in sub-Saharan Africa. Tanzania 
has two principal religions, Christianity and Islam.10 
Overall, 93% of the population rate religion as very 
important in their lives, and 83% attend religious services 
at least weekly.10 Traditional beliefs also remain powerful, 
with at least 60% of Tanzanians routinely seeking 
medical care from traditional healers.11 Religious leaders 
are among the most highly respected authorities in the 
villages.12 Therefore, in rural Tanzania and many other 
areas in which uptake of male circumcision is below 
target, promoting its use within religious communities is 
a unique opportunity to augment its acceptance.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Our clinical experience in Tanzania suggested that a church-
based intervention could be an effective means to encourage 
uptake of male circumcision or other healthy behaviours. To 
investigate what was known on this topic in sub-Saharan Africa, 
we searched PubMed, Ovid, and the Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews for articles published between Jan 1, 2000, 
and Dec 31, 2015. We initially used the following broad MeSH 
search terms: “religious beliefs”, “religious ethics”, “religion and 
medicine”, “health behavior”, “prevention”, “prevention 
measures”, “Africa south of the Sahara”, “HIV infections/
prevention and control”, and “HIV infections/transmission”. 
Among the articles identified using this strategy, we narrowed 
our focus using the following additional terms: “faith-based 
interventions”, “church-based”, “church”, “congregation”, 
“community-based interventions”, and “circumcision, male”. 
Among the articles identified by these strategies, we sought 
randomised controlled trials, cluster randomised trials, and 
systematic reviews. The searches and article selection were 
done by two of the study team members, who then presented 
findings to all coauthors for discussion.
The concept of health behaviour promotion in religious 
communities has been most broadly explored in church 
congregations in the USA. Work in the USA has largely focused 
on African-American and Latino populations, which bear a 
disproportionate burden of HIV and are also more likely than 
other groups to report a religious affiliation. Williams and 
colleagues did a systematic review in 2011 of 11 church-based 
HIV-focused programmes in the USA. They concluded that key 
components of successful programmes were providing church 
leaders and congregations with sufficient knowledge of a topic 
and ensuring that programmes were concordant with a 
church’s religious doctrine. They cited successful church-based 
initiatives that presented data to congregations about specific 
health needs in their neighbourhoods and then worked with 
congregants to decide together on the nature of their HIV 
intervention efforts.
By contrast, few studies in sub-Saharan Africa have documented 
the effect of church-based or faith-based teaching to promote 
healthy behaviour. A 2013 systematic review by Suthar and 
colleagues investigated community-based approaches to increase 
voluntary HIV counselling and testing in Africa and 
North America. The authors established that community-based 
approaches including door-to-door testing, school or workplace 
testing, and mobile test sites were effective in increasing HIV 
testing. The authors mentioned church-based testing only briefly 
in reference to a single cost-effectiveness study from South Africa. 
In 2015, a unique cluster randomised trial by Ezeanolue and 
colleagues randomised Nigerian churches to receive or not to 
receive health-themed baby showers that promoted HIV testing 
for pregnant women attending the church. 92% of pregnant 
women in the intervention group were HIV tested, compared 
with 55% of controls. The authors concluded that faith-based 
organisations and congregational centres, which are widely 
available and widely accessed in sub-Saharan Africa, offer 
numerous opportunities for health interventions.
Added value of this study
Despite major international efforts to increase male 
circumcision for HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, uptake 
has been slower than expected. Qualitative data indicates that a 
major reason might be the unaddressed religious implications of 
male circumcision in many devout religious communities. Data 
from the USA and a single randomised trial from sub-Saharan 
Africa suggest that promoting healthy behaviour within 
religious communities might be highly effective.Our cluster 
randomised trial showed that an educational intervention for 
religious leaders in Tanzania led to major increases in the uptake 
of male circumcision. These findings strengthen a growing 
understanding of the fundamental role that religion can have in 
promoting healthy behaviour in sub-Saharan Africa.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study’s findings, when added to the previous evidence base, 
show the formative role that religious leaders can play in 
encouraging healthy behaviour among their congregants. The 
large majority of people in sub-Saharan Africa are devoutly 
committed to their religious belief and practice, yet to date very 
few medical and public health interventions in the region have 
worked within religious communities. The Nigerian church-based 
study addressed a different HIV prevention issue and was done 
more than 4500 km away from our work in Tanzania, yet both 
studies show the potential for major public health gains when 
HIV prevention efforts are promoted through culturally-adapted 
religious community interventions in sub-Saharan Africa.

We hypothesised that the uptake of male circumcision 
could be increased if the practice was understood and 
endorsed by local religious leaders, who would then in 
turn educate their congregations. Building on findings 
from our focus group work, we designed a culturally 
adapted curriculum to educate church leaders of both 
genders about the religious, cultural, and medical aspects 
of male circumcision. We then did a community cluster 
randomised trial to establish whether providing this 
educational intervention for church leaders could 
increase the uptake of circumcision among men and 
boys in Tanzania.
Methods
Study design
We did a mixed-methods study that included a 
community cluster randomised trial, followed by focus-
group interviews in participating villages after completion 
of the trial.13 Our trial was done in the rural Mwanza 
region near Lake Victoria in northwest Tanzania, in 
conjunction with a voluntary medical male circumcision 
outreach campaign that was being offered by the 
Tanzanian Ministry of Health in the northwest of the 
country. The campaign brings a team of clinicians to 
undertake free male circumcisions in two to three 
villages at a time. The campaign routinely provides male 
circumcision and voluntary HIV counselling and testing 
to 100–200 men and boys per day and typically remains 
in a village for 3–6 weeks until the demand for 
circumcision decreases. In the northwest of Tanzania, 
the dominant Sukuma tribe does not traditionally 
circumcise, and Christians constituted more than 95% of 
the population,14 resulting in baseline male circumcision 
rates of about 20% before the circumcision campaign.14–16 
The Tanzanian policy encourages circumcision in men 
of all ages. The age group that was targeted by the 
campaign was 10–35 years because it has the highest 
incidence of HIV; however, all boys and men aged 
10 years or older were eligible for circumcision.
This trial was approved by the institutional review 
boards of Bugando Medical Centre (CREC/009/2014) and 
the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR/HQ/
R.8a/Vol. IX/1201), both in Tanzania, and Weill Cornell 
Medical College, NY, USA (1107011800). According to 
CONSORT guidelines, village leaders were informed of 
the study objectives and methods and gave permission 
for participation, and individuals who participated in 
focus-group interviews provided written informed 
consent.17,18 Study team members received training in the 
ethical conduct of research, including confidentiality and 
how to obtain informed consent.
Participants
The unit of randomisation in the cluster randomised 
trial was the village. We worked with the campaign to 
identify eligible village pairs, which were those that 
were in the rural Mwanza region of Tanzania, located 
within 60 km of each other, had clearly defined 
boundaries, and would be targeted by the male 
circumcision outreach campaign at the same time. 
Paired villages were therefore matched by geographical 
proximity and by the start date of the male circumcision 
in the village, which were prespecified to be the two 
most important factors for matching. In these rural 
regions, poor infrastructure, inadequate trans 
portation, 
and dirt roads lead to minimal contact between villages. 
Villages were matched in this way to account for 
variations in numbers of men seeking circumcision that 
could be associated with different months of the year, 
caused by factors such as farming responsibilities 
during wet versus dry seasons and the effect of an 
election year in Tanzania.
For focus groups, we enrolled individual church leaders 
from intervention and control villages. In these villages, 
we invited one church leader from each of six to eight 
different churches of varying sizes and denominations to 
participate. Church leaders provided written informed 
consent for participation in the focus-group discussions.
Randomisation and masking
Within the village pairs, villages were randomly assigned 
by a coin-toss to receive or not to receive the intervention. 
The coin-toss and assignment were done by one of the 
study investigators (DJD) who did not participate in 
enrolment or data collection. Assignments were stored 
in a sealed opaque envelope away from the study sites. 
Random allocations were not revealed to members of the 
male circumcision outreach campaign aside from 
clinicians who taught at the educational seminars. 
Because of the nature of the intervention, masking of 
church leaders or their congregations in the intervention 
villages was not possible.
Procedures
Both intervention and control villages received the 
standard community outreach events to promote male 
circumcision that are provided by the Tanzanian Ministry 
of Health during their campaign. The standard outreach 
includes 
community 
meetings, 
drama, 
broadcast 
announcements, and distribution of health information 
brochures, but these events do not specifically target 
religious leaders. The outreach activities and services 
provided by the circumcision outreach team were 
identical in all villages.
In villages that had been randomised to receive the 
intervention, Christian church leaders of both sexes and 
all denominations were invited to attend an educational 
seminar about male circumcision. The opportunity to 
participate in the educational seminar was explained to all 
Christian leaders by the village chairman of all Christian 
denominations. The chairman asked each church in the 
village to send at least one male and one female leader.
Seminars lasted for 1 day, and used a curriculum that 
our team developed in 2012 on the basis of our previous

focus-group work.7 Seminars were done in Kiswahili 
(the national language) and co-taught by a Tanzanian 
pastor and a Tanzanian clinician who worked with the 
Ministry of Health circumcision outreach campaign. 
Church leaders were taught medical, historical, religious, 
tribal, and social aspects of male circumcision and given 
tools to lead their congregations in the understanding 
and practice of this issue. Church leaders participated in 
lively discussions about ways in which they could 
encourage male circumcision within their congregations.
Seminars were provided immediately before or 
concurrent with the start of the male circumcision 
campaign at each site randomised to the intervention. 
Following the educational seminars, our study team 
continued to meet every 2 weeks with church leaders, 
both individually and for group discussions, for the 
duration of the male circumcision campaign in a given 
village. Our team provided feedback and answered 
questions for leaders as they implemented teaching 
programmes in their churches.
We used paper charts, routinely completed by hand for 
each male individual seeking circumcision, to document 
the total number of boys and men presenting for 
circumcision in each study village. We obtained the total 
number of male individuals living in each village from 
2012 Tanzania census data.19 We used this data to 
calculate the overall proportion of male individuals 
seeking circumcision during the campaign divided by 
the total population of men and boys per village.
Members of the circumcision outreach campaign staff 
recorded demographic information of men seeking 
circumcision and their stated reasons for seeking 
circumcision manually. This data was abstracted by 
members of our study team, unlinked from all personal 
identifiers. Members of our study team did not have 
contact with these individuals.
We additionally collected qualitative data following 
completion of the randomised trial by running 
focus-group interviews in both intervention and control 
villages. Focus groups were composed of religious 
leaders and two study team members, and were split by 
sex. Discussions, led by two trained study team members 
of the same sex as the groups, took place in Kiswahili in 
a private setting using guided discussion questions. The 
group interviews, each lasting approximately 60 min, 
were recorded with a digital recorder and transcribed and 
translated by a professional language service in Mwanza.
Outcomes
The primary study outcome was the proportion of the 
total male population in a village that presented for 
male circumcision at the village health centre during 
the outreach campaign. The numerator of this 
proportion is the number of men who sought 
circumcision in each village, as documented at the 
circumcision clinic. The denominator is the total male 
population observed and enumerated in each village in 
the 2012 national census.19 The 2012 census data was 
chosen as the best possible estimate of the target male 
population because it would not have been feasible to 
repeat the census in all male individuals in each village 
(more than 145 000 men and boys) and to establish 
baseline circumcision status of each male individual 
before the intervention.
Secondary outcomes were the proportion of men 
presenting for circumcision who stated that they wanted 
to be circumcised as a result of discussions in their 
churches, with a wife or girlfriend, with a teacher, with a

friend, or for their own health. We also used the focus 
groups to assess the prevailing attitudes that religious 
leaders 
expressed 
about 
male 
circumcision 
in 
intervention versus control villages.
Statistical analysis
We predicted a coefficient of variation between 
communities of 0∙2520 and that the proportion of males 
who would present for circumcision would be 65% in 
intervention villages versus 30% in control villages. We 
therefore calculated that we needed to randomise 
16 villages (eight pairs) to have 80% power to detect this 
difference at an α level of 0∙05.
We fitted a mixed-effects logistic regression model to 
calculate the odds ratio (OR) for circumcision in the 
intervention compared with the control group. The 
analysis was done using the person as the unit of analysis. 
Village pairs and clustering were taken into account with 
the following features: (1) we incorporate intercorrelation 
between participants within the same village using an 
indicator of the individual village as a random effect; 
(2) we estimate the effect of the intervention using an 
indicator of the intervention as a fixed effect; and (3) we 
adjust for the difference between village pairs using an 
indicator of the village pair as a fixed effect. These features 
reflect the nature of the study design and data well.
For the secondary outcomes, we analysed the 
differences in motivation for circumcision between 
intervention and control villages, as a village-level 
analysis only. We used logistic regression to compare the 
secondary outcomes while accounting for intercorrelation 
within the village pair. Data analysis was done using 
Stata IC version 13. This trial was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 02167776.
In our qualitative analysis of the post-trial focus group 
interviews, translated texts were imported into NVivo, 
version 10. The aim of this analysis was to do a thematic 
survey to explore views of focus group participants using 
interpretative phenomenological analysis.21,22 We did a 
stepwise analysis to establish prevailing themes from 
transcripts, using an independent and then a collaborative 
group process with the study team. Finally, we selected 
representative quotations to illustrate major themes.

Results
The first two villages were randomised in this study on 
June 15, 2014, and data collection was completed on 
Dec 10, 2015. During this time, we assessed 20 villages in 
the Mwanza region near Lake Victoria that were 
scheduled to be recipients of the male circumcision 
outreach campaign for inclusion in the study. We 
excluded two of these villages because they were urban 
centres without clear boundaries, and two others that did 
not have a clear pair village located within 60 km that 
would be targeted by the campaign at the same time

(figure 1). The remaining 16 villages were paired and 
subsequently randomised to receive the intervention or 
control (figure 2). We noted no differences between 
intervention and control villages in total population, 
male population, average household size, female-to-male 
ratio, or educational levels (measured by the national 
ranking of the village’s primary school, determined by 
test scores; table 1).
In each of the eight intervention villages, the 
educational seminar was provided to a median of 
162 (IQR 138–162) male and female religious leaders. In 
total, 1194 leaders received training.
In intervention villages in which church leaders 
received teaching about male circumcision, 52∙8% 
(30 889 of 58 536) of men and boys were circumcised 
compared with 29∙5% (25 484 of 86 492) of men and boys 
in the eight control villages (OR 3∙2 [95% CI 1∙4–7∙3], 
p=0∙006). The proportion of male individuals seeking 
circumcision was greater in the intervention group than 
in the control group in five of the pairs, approximately 
equal in two of the pairs, and lower than in the control 
group in one pair (figure 3, table 2). The intracluster 
correlation coefficient was 0∙22 [95% CI 0∙08–0∙35], 
which is lower than the predicted value of 0·25 that was 
used in our sample size calculation. Trials in which 
clusters have higher intracluster correlation coefficients 
require more clusters to demonstrate significance; 
therefore, the intracluster correlation coefficient of 0·22 
provided us with higher power than we had predicted.
Demographic data collected from men presenting for 
circumcision showed no significant differences between 
the intervention and control village in age or the distribution 
of religious faiths, classified as Muslim, Christian, or none 
(table 3). We observed a significant difference between 
groups in the proportion of men presenting as a result of 
discussions in church (30·8% in intervention villages 
vs 0·7% in control villages; p<0∙0001). Wives and girlfriends 
in intervention villages were also more likely to have 
encouraged their male partners to seek circumcision than 
those in the control villages (p=0∙002; table 3).
To investigate the robustness of our findings, we did 
several sensitivity analyses. First, we removed village pair 
number 4, which had the most significant difference 
between invention and control with regard to the number 
of male individuals who were circumcised. The OR 
for circumcision comparing intervention and control 
in the other village pairs remained significant 
(OR 1∙8 [95% CI 1∙2–2∙9], p=0∙01). We did a second 
sensitivity analysis to account for potential differences in 
the proportions of Muslims or men who were already 
circumcised in the villages. Even if 20% more of the 
population in the control villages than in the intervention 
villages were circumcised at baseline (which we 
represented by removing 20% of the denominators in all 
control villages) our findings remain significant (OR 2∙73 
[95% CI 1∙23–6∙04], p=0∙013).

After completion of the male circumcision campaign, 
we ran six focus-group interviews that included 
43 church leaders in three intervention and three control 
villages. Major themes that emerged are presented in the 
panel. In control villages, church leaders reported 
numerous rumours that had circulated in their villages 
about male circumcision and routinely stated that male 
circumcision was never broached in their churches. 
Furthermore, most leaders in the control villages felt 
frustrated and ill-equipped to discuss male circumcision 
with their congregations. By contrast, church leaders in 
intervention villages who attended the educational 
seminars reported a better understanding of male 
circumcision and a sense of empowerment to teach their 
congregations about the issue. Many described their 
congregations as seeking male circumcision in great 
numbers after church discussions of the topic.
Leaders in both intervention and control villages 
recognised the strong influence that they had had on the 
behaviour of their congregation. This sentiment was 
summarised poignantly by one female leader: “What I 
ask is that Christian religious leaders should teach a 
society to uptake male circumcision”.
Discussion
Our trial shows that equipping and empowering religious 
leaders to “teach a society to uptake male circumcision” 
significantly increased the use of voluntary medical male 
circumcision. We documented an absolute difference 
of 23·3% with an OR of 3·2 for circumcision in the 
intervention villages compared with the control villages, 
with a third of men who were circumcised in intervention 
villages citing discussions at church as a reason for 
seeking circumcision. Extrapolating this increase to the 
country of Tanzania and estimating the variation in 
baseline rates of circumcision in different regions of 
Tanzania,15,19 our strategy has the potential to lead to more 
than 1 million additional circumcisions (21·2 million men 
in mainland Tanzania × 0·29 who are uncircumcised × 
0·233 [our percentage increase] =1·44 million men; 
95% CI 1·41–1·47 million men), potentially preventing 
65 000–200 000 new HIV infections in Tanzania alone.23
We believe that a key reason for our study’s effectiveness 
was its attentiveness to structural and cultural factors in 
promoting behavioural change. A previous community 
randomised trial to promote adolescent health in 
Mwanza compared control villages with intervention 
villages that received a package of condom distribution, 
adolescent-friendly health services, and reproductive 
education in schools. The trial showed an increase in 
adolescents’ knowledge, but no effect on their health 
behaviour or the incidence of sexually-transmitted 
infections, HIV, or pregnancy.24 A process assessment of 
the trial concluded that a key reason for the absence of 
effect had been overemphasis on individual cognition 
with insufficient attention to social and structural 
determinants of behaviour.25 Recognising that most 
behavioural change in Tanzania operates through a 
community’s social and cultural norms, we designed our 
trial to work within highly influential religious 
communities. Furthermore, we grounded our work on 
the principle that church leaders themselves would be 
best equipped to establish the most appropriate and 
effective ways to encourage healthy behaviours among 
their congregants. For this reason, leaders were given 
Panel: Summary of themes and quotes from focus groups done after the conclusion 
of the male circumcision campaign in intervention and control villages
Church leaders and church members in control villages were misinformed and 
suspicious about male circumcision
• 
“ ‘Those who have undergone circumcision have gone to have their bodies used for 
business’—that is now what many people say and they fear to go for circumcision” 
(male leader, control village)
• 
“Christians as Christians…they have ideas that are different from Islam. That means 
they think as soon as they are circumcised it means that one way or another they 
agree with Islamic thinking” (male leader, control village)
Church leaders in control villages desired additional teaching about male circumcision
• 
“[Those working on the male circumcision campaign] don’t bring any seminar saying 
we come because of this and this and this … they just come all of a sudden coming to 
do this matter. You would think everyone in this world is educated like they are” 
(male leader, control village).
• 
“We answer by guessing. Even in the churches we don’t understand the meaning of 
circumcision. If there would come education in the church we would get the ability to 
educate someone so that he can do it” (male leader, control village)
• 
“For me, what I see, religion is not concerned with male circumcision because from the 
beginning up to my age I did not hear talking about male circumcision in churches” 
(female leader, control village)
Church leaders from intervention villages felt empowered and reported high levels 
of acceptance
• “We came to see that boy, it [male circumcision] is very important…the way we 
motivate in the church people received it…Boys, youth, men received it as being 
meaningful. In the past it had no meaning for us Christians. We saw it as improper 
that, I don’t know, it was shameful. If you preach about circumcision in church you feel 
like you are preaching insults but gosh, it is something meaningful” (female leader, 
intervention village)
• “After this seminar of circumcision we delivered the message in our churches. We told 
people about the children to take them to the health centre to be circumcised. People 
agreed to this matter…in great numbers. Yes, they did not refuse, they agreed 
completely” (female leader, intervention village)
Church leaders from intervention and control villages agreed that working through 
churches is effective
• 
“For those who refused to do circumcision, for Christians the first reason was that 
people did not have enough information concerning male circumcision in the 
church… But if people will be taught in the church they will not refuse to take 
circumcision” (female leader, control village)
• 
“Pastors have a power to motivate people and church members are trusting their 
pastors more than any other person or leader. If the pastor will encourage people in 
church many young men will uptake circumcision” (female leader, control village)
• 
“What I ask is that Christian religious leaders should teach a society to uptake male 
circumcision” (female leader, intervention village)

knowledge and tools to teach, but each leader was left to 
decide how to best address issues of male circumcision 
in his or her own community.
Our study substantiates the effectiveness of an 
innovative concept for health promotion in sub-Saharan 
Africa—namely, drawing on the power of religious 
leaders to promote healthy behaviour among their 
congregants. Despite high prevalence of devout religious 
populations throughout much of Africa,10 and some 
efforts to promote healthy behaviour in church contexts 
in the USA,26,27 few formal assessments of using religion-
based interventions to affect health behaviour in Africa 
have been done. One well designed community 
randomised trial in Nigerian churches offered specialised 
baby showers, which included medical teaching and on-
site laboratory HIV testing for pregnant women in 
church congregations.28 The Nigerian study documented 
a major increase in uptake of antenatal HIV tests. Similar 
to our work in Tanzania, the team in Nigeria concluded 
that 
working 
through 
highly-accessed 
religious 
institutions is an effective way to reach populations even 
in the most rural communities.
Several of the principles that we have shown to be 
effective in our trial in Tanzania have been described in 
reviews of studies from the USA, where the concept of 
promoting health through religious communities has 
been more broadly explored than it has in sub-Saharan 
Africa. A systematic review of 11 church-based 
programmes that focused on HIV/AIDS in the USA 
found that providing sufficient information to clergy and 
ensuring that health messages were congruent with 
church doctrine were important aspects of successful 
programmes.27 Others have highlighted the importance 
of designing an intervention that accounts for the 
cultural context and can be delivered, at least in part, by 
the community itself.26,29–31 Our study lays groundwork 
for additional studies to establish the effect of promoting 
healthy behaviours through religious communities in 
sub-Saharan Africa, where the overwhelming majority 
of the population is deeply committed to religious faith 
and practice.10
The extremely high prevalence of circumcision in one 
village in our study reflects a unique situation that would 
be difficult to duplicate. Our study team reported a robust 
theological debate about male circumcision among 
church leaders in that particular village. In particular, 
one highly influential leader preached strongly against 
male circumcision, insisting that it was a campaign led 
by foreign devil worshippers who were stealing foreskins 
for profit. The dissenting leader’s views caught the 
attention of village civic leaders, leading to additional 
discussions throughout the entire village. Ultimately, the 
dissenting leader was invited to observe the operations of 
the male circumcision campaign at the health centre, 
including witnessing the burning of foreskins on site. 
The leader changed position and then preached strongly 
and repeatedly in favour of male circumcision for the 
remainder of the campaign. We suspect that this debate, 
which did not occur at other intervention sites, could 
have further impassioned church leaders who agreed 
with promoting male circumcision when they discussed 
these issues with their congregations. This case study 
suggests that involving not only church but also civic 
leaders might further increase the effect of our 
educational intervention.
The sensitivity analysis suggests that our findings 
remain robust despite the limitations of our study. 
Because the collection of baseline data on circumcision 
status and religion from more than 145 000 men in 
16 rural villages would not have been feasible, we did our 
study in a region of Tanzania in which baseline rates of 
male circumcision were low and more than 95% of the 
population is Christian. We therefore relied on 2012 
national census data, and assumed that paired nearby 
villages would have similar baseline characteristics. We 
further assumed that most village residents were not 
aware of the village’s assignment as an intervention or 
control group because of the breadth of educational 
activities, outside of the church, that were provided in all 
study villages. A major strength of our cluster randomised 
trial is that randomisation should address these and 
other potential confounders.
In conclusion, we have shown that an intervention to 
educate church leaders about HIV prevention and male 
circumcision led to a major increase in uptake of male 
circumcision. We believe that this innovative concept of 
inciting behavioural change by working with influential 
religious leaders should be incorporated as an integral 
part of all circumcision campaigns. Because of the 
contextual flexibility of our intervention, we believe that it 
will be broadly applicable for addressing other health 
behaviours and for working in other regions and among 
other religious groups. Moreover, our work has major 
implications for health-care delivery in much of sub-
Saharan Africa, where the large majority of people are 
highly committed to their faith traditions. We are now 
adapting this curriculum to educate Muslim leaders and 
to address other challenging health behaviours in 
Tanzania.
