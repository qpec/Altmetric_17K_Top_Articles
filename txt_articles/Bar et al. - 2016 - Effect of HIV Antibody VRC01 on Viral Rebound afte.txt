Abstract
BACKGROUND—The discovery of potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has made passive immunization a potential strategy for the 
prevention and treatment of HIV infection. We sought to determine whether passive administration 
of VRC01, a bNAb targeting the HIV CD4-binding site, can safely prevent or delay plasma viral 
rebound after the discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART).
METHODS—We conducted two open-label trials (AIDS Clinical Trials Group [ACTG] A5340 
and National Institutes of Health [NIH] 15-I-0140) of the safety, side-effect profile, 
pharmacokinetic properties, and antiviral activity of VRC01 in persons with HIV infection who 
were undergoing interruption of ART.
RESULTS—A total of 24 participants were enrolled, and one serious alcohol-related adverse 
event occurred. Viral rebound occurred despite plasma VRC01 concentrations greater than 50 μg 
per milliliter. The median time to rebound was 4 weeks in the A5340 trial and 5.6 weeks in the 
NIH trial. Study participants were more likely than historical controls to have viral suppression at 
week 4 (38% vs. 13%, P = 0.04 by a two-sided Fisher’s exact test in the A5340 trial; and 80% vs. 
13%, P<0.001 by a two-sided Fisher’s exact test in the NIH trial) but the difference was not 
significant at week 8. Analyses of virus populations before ART as well as before and after ART 
interruption showed that VRC01 exerted pressure on rebounding virus, resulting in restriction of 
recrudescent viruses and selection for preexisting and emerging antibody neutralization–resistant 
virus.
CONCLUSIONS—VRC01 slightly delayed plasma viral rebound in the trial participants, as 
compared with historical controls, but it did not maintain viral suppression by week 8. In the small 
number of participants enrolled in these trials, no safety concerns were identified with passive

 immunization with a single bNAb (VRC01). (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases and others; ACTG A5340 and NIH 15-I-0140 ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, 
NCT02463227 and NCT02471326.)
Therapeutic administration of monoclonal antibodies has revolutionized treatment options in 
oncology, rheumatology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, neurology, and the field of 
infectious diseases.1,2 The use of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a potential approach to the prevention of HIV infection 
and its therapy and cure.3,4 VRC01 is a bNAb that targets the CD4-binding site of the HIV 
envelope glycoprotein. VRC01 has been shown to neutralize approximately 90% of a broad 
panel of 190 group M HIV envelope pseudotyped viruses with a mean 50% inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) of 0.33 μg per milliliter.5 Passive administration of bNAbs, including 
VRC01, has been shown to prevent HIV transmission in animal models6–9 and is now being 
tested in clinical trials of vertical and horizontal transmission in humans.
Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) potently suppresses HIV replication; however, it 
does not eradicate the persistent viral reservoir.10 In most HIV-infected persons, plasma viral 
rebound predictably occurs within days after treatment interruption.11–14 HIV-specific 
bNAbs hold potential advantages over current ART. First, bNAbs can be administered as 
long-acting agents by means of antibody engineering6 or vectored delivery. 15,16 Second, 
unlike classic ART, antibody Fc effector functions enable the killing of HIV-infected cells, 
which may assist in the clearance of the persistent viral reservoir.4,17 Finally, bNAbs engage 
the host immune system and may augment antiviral responses.18,19
Preclinical studies of single and combination bNAbs in animal models have shown virus 
suppression, enhanced viral killing, augmented anti-HIV immune responses, and reduction 
of the cellular reservoir.18,20,21 In clinical trials involving humans, no safety concerns have 
been identified thus far with passive administration of bNAbs targeting the CD4-binding site 
in healthy uninfected persons and in participants with chronic HIV infection who have either 
viremia or viral suppression.22–24 Passive administration of VRC01 to HIV viremic persons 
led to a reduction of 1.1 to 1.8 log10 in plasma HIV viremia, although it was ineffective in 
the quarter of study participants who had baseline resistance to the antibody.24 In addition, 
we previously found that HIV isolated from the latent viral reservoir of many, but not all, 
infected persons was inhibited by VRC01 ex vivo.17 Collectively, these findings suggest that 
passive immunotherapy with VRC01 could potentially prevent plasma viral rebound in HIV-
infected persons after analytic treatment interruption.
Here, we report the results of two phase 1 clinical trials designed to investigate the 
feasibility of achieving sustained suppression of plasma viremia (virologic remission) in 
HIV-infected persons by means of multiple infusions of VRC01 after the discontinuation of 
ART that had been successfully suppressing plasma viremia below the detectable 
concentration. Our goals were to ascertain whether the passive administration of VRC01 is 
safe and has an acceptable adverse-event and side-effect profile, leads to high VRC01 
plasma concentrations, can suppress plasma viremia after the discontinuation of ART, and 
could inform our understanding of recrudescent viruses after immunologic intervention.

 METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT
We conducted two clinical trials with similar designs to evaluate the safety, adverse-event 
and side-effect profile, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and antiviral activity of the human 
monoclonal antibody VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) in HIV-infected persons who 
were undergoing analytic treatment interruption. The first trial, AIDS Clinical Trials Group 
(ACTG) A5340, was conducted at the clinical research sites of the University of 
Pennsylvania and University of Alabama (see the protocol, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org). The second trial (NIH 15-I-0140, hereafter referred to as the National 
Institutes of Health [NIH] trial) was conducted at the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases, NIH, in Bethesda, Maryland (see the protocol).
Both trials had similar entry criteria and recruited participants who had chronic HIV 
infection with fully suppressed plasma viremia while receiving ART (details are provided in 
the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org). Study participants were not prescreened for sensitivity of the virus to 
neutralization by VRC01 in either trial.
The trials were reviewed by the institutional review boards of each participating institution. 
All participants provided written informed consent. All the authors vouch for the accuracy 
and completeness of the data and analyses and the fidelity of the trial to the respective 
protocol. There was no commercial support for these trials.
TREATMENT PROCEDURES, STUDY OBJECTIVES, AND STUDY OUTCOMES
In step 1 of the A5340 trial, 14 participants received up to three doses of VRC01 (40 mg per 
kilogram of body weight administered intravenously) at 3-week intervals (Fig. 1). One week 
after the first dose of VRC01, participants discontinued ART and were followed at weekly 
intervals until they had a confirmed CD4 T-cell count of less than 350 cells per cubic 
millimeter or a return of HIV viremia, which was defined as an HIV RNA level of 200 
copies or more per milliliter followed by a confirmation level of 1000 copies or more per 
milliliter or three consecutive measurements of 200 copies or more per milliliter. On 
confirmation of viral rebound or a decrease in CD4 T cells, participants entered step 2, at 
which point ART was reinitiated and participants were followed until the HIV viral load was 
less than 50 copies per milliliter.
The primary objectives of the A5340 trial were to assess the safety and side-effect profile of 
multiple doses of VRC01 administered to persons with plasma viremia suppressed to below 
detectable levels and to estimate the proportion of participants with a return of viremia in the 
presence of high plasma levels of VRC01 at 8 weeks of analytic treatment interruption. 
Secondary objectives were the frequency of rebound viremia at 4 weeks and the evaluation 
of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the product. Key exploratory objectives were the 
frequency of development of antibodies against VRC01 and the genetic and phenotypic 
characterization of the rebound virus. We calculated that 13 participants with data that could 
be evaluated would be required to provide this trial with 95% power to detect a difference of

 40 percentage points (i.e., a return of viremia by 8 weeks in 50% of trial participants vs. 
90% of historical controls)14 at a two-sided alpha level of 0.10.
In the NIH trial, 10 participants received infusions of VRC01 (at a dose of 40 mg per 
kilogram) intravenously 3 days before and 14 and 28 days after the discontinuation of ART 
and monthly thereafter (Fig. 1). Plasma viremia and CD4 T-cell counts were measured at 
baseline (day −3) and subsequently (Fig. 1). Participants who met any of the following 
criteria discontinued VRC01 infusions and resumed ART: a decrease of more than 30% in 
the baseline CD4 T-cell count or an absolute CD4 T-cell count below 350 cells per cubic 
millimeter, a sustained (≥2 weeks) HIV plasma viremia greater than 1000 copies per 
milliliter, any HIV-related symptoms, or pregnancy.
The primary end point of the NIH trial was safety, as defined according to the rate of 
occurrence of grade 3 or higher adverse events, including serious adverse events, that were 
possibly related to infusion of VRC01. The secondary end point was virologic efficacy, as 
defined according to the number of participants who met protocol-defined, virologic, 
immunologic, or clinical criteria to discontinue VRC01 infusions and restart ART. Post hoc 
analyses of the sequence diversity at the time of plasma viral rebound and the neutralization 
capacity of VRC01 and other bNAbs against autologous HIV before and after antibody 
infusions were performed.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analysis of the time to the first confirmed HIV RNA level of 200 copies or more 
per milliliter during the analytic treatment interruption was performed in both trials (post 
hoc in the NIH trial). Measurements of HIV RNA levels that were taken closest to each 
scheduled week were obtained, and the cumulative probability of continued virologic 
suppression (i.e., no confirmed HIV RNA level ≥200 copies per milliliter) was calculated by 
means of Kaplan–Meier methods.
In both trials, a two-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the percentage of trial 
participants with viral rebound at 4 and 8 weeks (post hoc in the NIH trial) with the 
percentage of historical controls with viral rebound in previous treatment-interruption trials 
conducted by the ACTG.14 In the A5340 trial, the proportion of participants with adverse 
events was estimated with an exact 95% confidence interval. The proportion of participants 
who had return of viremia at 8 weeks of analytic treatment interruption and who had data 
that could be evaluated was estimated with a prespecified exact 90% confidence interval. 
Details of the historical control group, participant monitoring, and laboratory and statistical 
methods are outlined in the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
RESULTS
STUDY PARTICIPANTS
The A5340 trial enrolled 14 participants, all of whom were male, with a median CD4 T-cell 
count at enrollment of 896 cells per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 579 to 1053) and a 
median duration from the initiation of ART to study entry of 4.7 years (interquartile range,

 3.8 to 6.0). One participant was excluded from the analyses of time to viral rebound because 
he discontinued ART before the administration of VRC01.
The NIH trial enrolled 10 participants (8 men and 2 women) with a median CD4 T-cell 
count of 724 cells per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 630 to 926) (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix) and a median duration from the initiation of ART to study entry 
of 10.0 years (interquartile range, 7.7 to 13.3). In the NIH participants, the median frequency 
of CD4 T cells carrying HIV proviral DNA was 881 copies per 106 cells (range, 154 to 
2079) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Table 1 lists the baseline characteristics of 
the participants in both trials and the historical controls.
SAFETY
All participants completed VRC01 infusions per protocol. One serious adverse event 
occurred in a participant who required a brief hospital admission to recover from conscious 
sedation following upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to evaluate a history of possible 
hematemesis after alcohol ingestion. In the A5340 trial, 14 participants received from 1 to 3 
infusions of VRC01, and none had a grade 3 or higher adverse event or a grade 2 VRC01-
related adverse event (0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0 to 23). In the NIH trial, 
participants received 2 to 6 infusions (median, 3.5) of VRC01, and no adverse events 
occurred during the infusion or immediate postinfusion period. Complete data on adverse 
events are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. These safety results are consistent with 
those of much larger and ongoing studies of the same product.
In 24 participants, ART was reinitiated on confirmation of viral rebound and their plasma 
viremia was suppressed again. In the A5340 trial, participants had not received ART for a 
median of 6 weeks (range, 3 to 13). The median time from the first detectable HIV RNA 
level of 200 copies per milliliter or more to the first suppressed HIV level of less than 200 
copies per milliliter after ART reinitiation was 6 weeks (range, 3 to 14). In the NIH trial, 
participants did not receive ART for a median of 8 weeks (range, 3 to 17). The median time 
from the first detectable HIV RNA level of 200 copies or more per milliliter to the first 
suppressed HIV level of less than 200 copies per milliliter after ART reinitiation was 11 
weeks (range, 4 to 20). No participant had a confirmed decrease in the CD4 T-cell count 
below 350 cells per milliliter; 1 participant had a decrease of more than 30% from the 
baseline CD4 T-cell count; this led to the reinitiation of ART per protocol.
TIME TO VIRAL REBOUND
In both trials, the administration of VRC01 did not produce durable suppression of plasma 
viremia. In the A5340 trial, 12 of 13 participants with data that could be evaluated had viral 
rebound of more than 200 copies per milliliter at or before week 8 (92%; 90% CI, 68 to 
100), with a median time to rebound of 4 weeks (interquartile range, 3 to 5) (Fig. 2A, and 
Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). This is a small delay in viral rebound as compared 
with the delay in historical controls from previous ACTG studies; 38% of the participants 
versus 13% of the controls had viral suppression at week 4 (P = 0.04 by a two-sided Fisher’s 
exact test) and 8% and 3%, respectively, had viral suppression at week 8 (P = 0.44 by a two-
sided Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. 2C). One participant (Participant A07) in the A5340 trial had

 prolonged viral suppression, and detectable plasma viremia developed at week 11 of the 
analytic treatment interruption when plasma VRC01 levels had waned significantly (plasma 
VRC01 concentration, 25 μg per milliliter) (Fig. 2A, and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). One participant (Participant A11) was excluded from the evaluation of time to 
viral rebound, since he had detectable plasma viremia at the time of VRC01 infusion (Fig. 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In the NIH trial, viral rebound to more than 40 copies per milliliter occurred during VRC01 
treatment in all 10 participants, with a median time to rebound of 39 days (interquartile 
range, 29 to 39) or 5.6 weeks (interquartile range, 4.1 to 5.6) (Fig. 2B, and Fig. S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). However, as compared with the time to plasma viral rebound 
(HIV RNA level, ≥200 copies per milliliter) in historical controls, VRC01 infusion led to a 
longer time to rebound (≥200 copies per milliliter), and 80% of the participants versus 13% 
of the controls had viral suppression at week 4 (P<0.001 by a two-sided Fisher’s exact test) 
and 10% and 3%, respectively, had viral suppression at week 8 (P = 0.37 by a two-sided 
Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. 2C). Nine of 10 study participants resumed ART because of 
virologic failure; ART was reinitiated in the remaining participant (Participant N03) because 
of a significant decrease in the CD4 T-cell count (>30%) (Figs. S1 and S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix) associated with low-level plasma viremia (HIV RNA level, 471 
copies per milliliter). One participant (Participant N04) self-administered antiretroviral drugs 
for 3 days off protocol after the first ART interruption; self-administration of antiretroviral 
drugs may have contributed to a brief period of aviremia (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). However, his plasma viremia rebounded shortly after the second ART 
interruption.
VRC01 PHARMACOKINETIC CHARACTERISTICS
Plasma levels of VRC01 that were achieved by passive infusion were similar to levels 
reported in previous trials.23,24 In the A5340 trial, participants received 40 mg of VRC01 per 
kilogram every 3 weeks for three doses and maintained measured plasma VRC01 levels well 
above 50 μg per milliliter for 8 weeks (median, 175 μg per milliliter; range, 68 to 1494) (Fig. 
S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In the NIH trial, participants received 40 mg of VRC01 per kilogram every 2 weeks for the 
first three doses, then monthly for up to 6 months. NIH trial participants maintained levels of 
VRC01 in plasma above 100 μg per milliliter at almost all time points throughout the trial 
(Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Measured values of plasma VRC01 at the time of rebound were greater than 50 μg per 
milliliter in all trial participants, except for Participant A07 in the A5340 trial, who had 
delayed rebound at week 11 of analytic treatment interruption with VRC01 levels of 
approximately 25 μg per milliliter (Fig. 2D). No anti-VRC01 antibodies were identified in 
any trial participants.
SEQUENCE EVIDENCE OF VRC01-MEDIATED VIRUS RESTRICTION
Different strategies were applied in each trial to elucidate the mechanisms leading to early 
viral rebound. To characterize rebounding viral populations in the A5340 trial, single-

 genome sequencing25 of plasma HIV env genes from pre-ART plasma samples (available in 
8 participants) and rebound plasma samples from the first and second weeks of detectable 
viremia (available in 13 participants) was performed. When analyzed together in a maximum 
likelihood phylogenetic tree, the pre-ART and rebound sequences of the 13 participants with 
data that could be evaluated clustered independently, indicating the relatedness of pre-ART 
and rebound viruses (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Three independent studies have recently shown that without any additional intervention 
besides ART, viral rebound after analytic treatment interruption is consistently polyclonal 
because of the reactivation of multiple latent viruses.26–28 Genetic evidence of VRC01-
mediated restriction of viral rebound was assessed by analyzing the clonality of rebound 
virus or by enumerating genetically distinct virus populations that composed rebound 
viremia. In 3 of 12 participants (25%) in the A5340 trial who had viral rebound in the 
presence of high concentrations of VRC01, sequence evidence suggested VRC01-mediated 
restriction of viral rebound. As shown in Participant A04 in Figure 3A and Participants A02 
and A12 in Figure S8 in the Supplementary Appendix, pre-ART plasma virus from persons 
with chronic infection formed characteristic diverse trees,29 whereas rebound virus clustered 
into single low-diversity lineages of nearly identical sequences (Figs. S9 and S10 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
The remaining 9 of 12 participants (75%) had polyclonal rebound akin to what is reported in 
historical analytic treatment interruption without intervention,26,27 suggesting possible 
preexisting resistance. As shown in Figure 3B, rebound virus in Participant A05 clustered 
into multiple genetically distinct rebound lineages that align throughout the pre-ART virus 
phylogeny, whereas multiple rebound lineages in Participant A03 clustered unevenly within 
the pre-ART virus population (Fig. 3C). The rebound sequences in Participant A07 in the 
A5340 trial (Fig. 3D), who had virus suppression maintained until week 11 of analytic 
treatment interruption and had rebound with lower VRC01 concentrations, formed two 
closely related lineages.
Evidence of selective pressure exerted by VRC01 was also explored at the molecular level in 
the NIH trial by amplifying env genes by means of single-genome sequencing from pre-ART 
(a median of 1.8 months before the initiation of ART) and rebound plasma samples. As in 
the A5340 trial, the majority of NIH trial participants had phylogenetic evidence of multiple 
viral lineages in rebound plasma virus (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Appendix). Specific 
amino acid changes within the VRC01 antibody-binding site were examined with the use of 
a neutralization-based epitope prediction algorithm.30 In four of the six NIH trial 
participants, changes were identified in or near the VRC01 epitope, mainly in the V5 loop 
and the CD4-binding loop (Fig. S12 in the Supplementary Appendix); this outcome 
suggested VRC01-mediated selective pressure on rebounding virus. Similar patterns were 
seen in the VRC01-binding site in participants in the A5340 trial (Fig. S10 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
SELECTION FOR VRC01-RESISTANT REBOUNDING VIRUSES
The role of resistance to VRC01 at viral rebound in the presence of high VRC01 
concentrations in the A5340 trial was assessed by cloning selected env genes from 46 quasi-

 species and lineages collected throughout the pre-ART and rebound periods of the trial 
(median, 3 pre-ART and 3 rebound env genes per participant). These env genes were cloned, 
expressed as pseudoviruses, and tested for sensitivity to neutralization by VRC01. Notably, 
nearly all participants who had viral rebound early with high concentrations of plasma 
VRC01 had rebound Env pseudoviruses with IC50 neutralization titers higher than 1 μg per 
milliliter (median, 4.1 μg per milliliter; range, 1.9 to >50.0), conferring what is generally 
perceived to be at least moderate resistance to VRC01.5,31,32 Only Participants A02 and 
A07, who had rebound at week 8 and 11 after analytic treatment interruption, respectively, 
had rebound viruses with IC50 neutralization titers below 1 μg per milliliter (Fig. 3E).
Similarly, all participants who had viral rebound early had preexisting resistant virus as 
either dominant or minor populations in the pre-ART virus, as shown in the phylogenetic 
trees of the four participants in Figure 3A through 3D. The prevalence of preexisting 
resistance predicted the pattern of rebound. In participants with VRC01-resistant virus in 
multiple pre-ART variants (e.g., Participants A05, A06, and A09) (Fig. 3, and Fig. S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), VRC01 therapy was followed by rapid, polyclonal rebound with 
highly resistant virus. In participants in whom there was a range of neutralization 
sensitivities in the baseline virus (e.g., Participants A03 and A04 [Fig. 3] and Participant 
A12 [Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix]), VRC01 therapy led to monoclonal or 
compartmentalized rebound after variable durations of suppression (range, 2 to 6 weeks). 
Finally, Participants A02 and A07, who had highly sensitive virus throughout their tested 
pre-ART populations, had suppression maintained for 7 and 10 weeks, respectively, and had 
rebound with relatively sensitive monoclonal or oligoclonal virus.
Regardless of the time to rebound, resistance to VRC01 increased almost universally in 
participants in the A5340 trial during treatment with VRC01. In an exploratory analysis, pre-
ART and rebound Env pseudoviruses were compared in the eight participants in whom both 
samples were available. This analysis showed significantly increased VRC01 resistance at 
rebound by IC50 (mean increase by a factor of 3.44, P = 0.006 by a two-sided random-
effects model) and IC80 (mean increase by a factor of 3.79, P = 0.004 by a two-sided 
random-effects model) (Fig. 3E and 3F, and Fig. S13 in the Supplementary Appendix).
NEUTRALIZATION CAPACITY OF VRC01 AND OTHER BNABS AGAINST AUTOLOGOUS HIV 
BEFORE AND AFTER ANTIBODY INFUSIONS
In the NIH trial, the role of resistance to VRC01 and other bNAbs was explored by testing 
fully replication-competent autologous HIV isolates recovered from the CD4 T cells of trial 
participants before and after antibody infusions. Multiple viral isolates (182 total) were 
generated from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells obtained from trial participants before 
infusions of VRC01 (eight participants, 75 isolates) and after infusions of VRC01 (nine 
participants, 107 isolates) and the discontinuation of ART. The susceptibility of the 
infectious isolates to neutralization by VRC01 and other bNAbs (3BNC117, 10–1074, and 
PGT121), and anti-CD4 antibody (UB-421) was then measured with the latter antibodies 
serving as controls, both for comparison with antibodies currently being tested in 
monotherapy trials as well as for their possible inclusion in future combination antibody 
trials. As shown in Figure 4A, the capacity of VRC01 to neutralize the preinfusion viral

 isolates was significantly lower than that of 3BNC117 (P = 0.008), 10–1074 (P = 0.03), and 
UB-421 (P = 0.008); this finding strongly suggests that the preexisting viral reservoir of the 
majority of NIH trial participants harbored VRC01-resistant HIV.
Next, the capacity of VRC01 to suppress the preinfusion and postinfusion autologous virus 
was evaluated in the seven participants from whom infectious isolates could be recovered at 
both time points (Fig. 4B, and Figs. S14 and S15 in the Supplementary Appendix). Notably, 
virus sensitivity to VRC01 diminished significantly after multiple infusions of VRC01 
during analytic treatment interruption in several participants. Participant-to-participant 
variability prevented us from concluding that the observed decrease in sensitivity was 
universal (P = 0.08). Nonetheless, in Participants N03, N04, N08, and N10, there was strong 
evidence of the emergence of HIV isolates that were less sensitive to VRC01, highly 
resistant to VRC01, or both (Fig. 4B). It is noteworthy that the preinfusion isolates obtained 
from Participant N09 were already highly resistant to VRC01 and remained resistant after 
infusion. In contrast, there were no detected changes in susceptibility of pre-ART versus 
rebound viral isolates to neutralization by 3BNC117, 10–1074, PGT121, and UB-421 (Figs. 
S14 and S15 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rebound VRC01-resistant isolates from 
two participants (Participants N04 and N08) were also resistant to the CD4-binding site 
bNAb 3BNC117 (Figs. S14 and S15 in the Supplementary Appendix). Collectively, the 
analyses of viral isolates in the NIH trial corroborate the sequence-based analysis observed 
in the A5340 trial and show selection for preexisting VRC01-resistant virus and the capacity 
for VRC01 to further drive resistance during analytic treatment interruption.
DISCUSSION
In two similarly designed clinical trials, we found that the passive administration of multiple 
doses of VRC01 monotherapy generated high plasma VRC01 concentrations, and no safety 
concerns were identified. In persons with chronic HIV infection who were undergoing 
analytic treatment interruption, as compared with historical controls, VRC01 therapy 
slightly delayed plasma viral rebound; however, viral suppression beyond 8 weeks was not 
achieved. Sequence-based and neutralization analyses suggest that VRC01 can restrict the 
clonality of rebounding virus in some participants, select for preexisting resistance, and 
drive the emergence of VRC01-resistant virus. Baseline resistance to VRC01 was common 
in both trials, suggesting that persons with chronic infection may frequently harbor archived 
resistant virus to this antibody.
Our results suggest that the prevalence of clinically significant archived resistance to VRC01 
may present a considerable challenge in the use of bNAbs as therapeutic agents for HIV 
infection. Preexisting resistance to bNAbs is biologically plausible, since before the 
initiation of ART, persons with chronic HIV infection have extensive exposure to a 
polyclonal autologous B-cell response that results in archived escape variants to many 
antibody specificities, including those of bNAb target epitopes.33–36 Indeed, a previous 
study tested replication-competent viral isolates derived from the latent viral reservoir and 
showed resistance to VRC01 in a substantial proportion of persons in an autologous culture 
system.17 In participants with only sensitive pre-ART virus (tested as infectious isolates or 
envelope-pseudo-typed virus) who had rebound with VRC01-resistant virus, it is unclear

 whether this rebound indicates selection for low-frequency resistant viruses that were not 
sampled or the emergence of new VRC01 resistance. The development of methods to 
characterize the phenotypic characteristics (e.g., neutralization sensitivity) of the persistent 
replication-competent viral reservoir will be needed to distinguish between these different 
mechanisms of failure of HIV-specific bNAbs.
Although extensive preexisting resistance limited the efficacy of VRC01 in both trials, it is 
notable that in a previous study of viral isolates17 and the present NIH clinical trial, other 
tested bNAbs appeared to have less prevalent archived resistance (Fig. 4A). The efficacy of 
any given bNAbs in persons with chronic HIV infection will be dependent in part on 
whether these persons have resistant virus to that bNAb, even at very low frequencies, in 
persistent viral reservoirs. Future clinical trials may consider prescreening for resistance, 
although this is a complex task.
The emergence of VRC01-resistant HIV after infusions of VRC01 and discontinuation of 
ART was observed in both trials. However, a fraction of infectious HIV isolates in some trial 
participants remained sensitive to VRC01 despite viral rebound in the presence of high 
levels of VRC01 in plasma. This could be explained by a possible artifact of culture 
whereby isolates from the persistent viral reservoir37–39 were induced by the ex vivo 
conditions needed to stimulate cells into producing replication-competent viral isolates, but 
they may not have been actively replicating after discontinuation of ART. In the A5340 trial, 
virus that rebounded early in the presence of high concentrations of VRC01 was almost 
universally resistant to VRC01. Only two participants (including Participant A07, who had 
viral rebound after plasma VRC01 concentrations had waned substantially) had VRC01-
sensitive envelope glycoproteins.
Our findings highlight an important consideration for the design of future clinical trials of 
passive immunotherapy in HIV-infected persons. During the early years of development of 
antiretroviral drugs for HIV infection, the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
zidovudine used as a single agent resulted in a decrease of approximately 0.5 log copies per 
milliliter in plasma viremia that almost invariably rebounded40 with zidovudine-resistant 
mutants.41 The advent of additional antiretroviral drugs directed at different viral targets and 
used in combinations led to more potent viral suppression for longer durations of time.42,43 
Analogous to current regimens of highly successful combination ART that targets multiple 
HIV gene products,44 our data suggest that immunotherapy will probably require multiple 
bNAbs that target different sites on the HIV envelope glycoprotein.

 Figure 1. Trial Designs
As shown in Panel A, the A5340 trial had two steps. In step 1, participants received an 
intravenous infusion of VRC01 (at a dose of 40 mg per kilogram of body weight) (triangles) 
1 week before and 2 and 5 weeks after discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART 
was discontinued 1 week after the first VRC01 infusion. The treatment interruption was 
open-ended, and participants were monitored weekly until viral rebound. On confirmed 
plasma viral rebound, participants entered step 2 and ART was reinitiated. Participants were 
then followed until plasma viremia decreased below 50 copies per milliliter. HIV env 
sequencing (gray circles) was performed with the use of plasma samples obtained before the 
initiation of ART and after viral rebound. As shown in Panel B, in the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) trial, participants received infusions of VRC01 (at a dose of 40 kg per 
kilogram) (triangles) 3 days before and 14 to 28 days after discontinuation of ART, and 
monthly thereafter. Infectious viral isolates (orange circles) were generated from samples 
obtained before VRC01 infusion and after plasma viral rebound. HIV env sequencing (gray 
circles) was performed with the use of plasma samples obtained before the initiation of ART 
and after viral rebound.

ART
Panel A shows the plasma viremia of participants in the A5340 trial after the interruption of 
therapy. The gray dotted line indicates the limit of detection of the assay (HIV RNA level, 
20 copies per milliliter). Panel B shows the plasma viremia of NIH trial participants after 
interruption of therapy. The gray dotted line indicates the limit of detection of the assay 
(HIV RNA level, 40 copies per milliliter). Panel C shows the Kaplan–Meier curve of plasma 
viral suppression (<200 copies per milliliter) after VRC01 administration and analytic 
treatment interruption in A5340 and NIH trial participants as compared with historical 
participants in AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) trials who underwent interruption of 
therapy without other immunotherapeutic interventions. Panel D shows in vivo plasma levels 
of VRC01 at the first detectable plasma viremia. The limit of detection of VRC01 was less 
than 0.98 μg per milliliter.

 specific envelope glycoprotein that was cloned and tested for phenotypic features. Asterisks 
indicate bootstrap support of greater than 80%. As shown in Panel A, Participant A04 had 
monoclonal rebound with VRC01-resistant virus. As shown in Panel B, Participant A05 had 
polyclonal rebound with VRC01-resistant virus. As shown in Panel C, Participant A03 had 
polyclonal rebound with VRC01-resistant virus. Multiple rebound lineages arise clustered 
within one area of the phylogeny. Sequences from Participant A03 were tested for 
clustering; Slatkin–Maddison and Hudson’s “nearest neighbor” tests support sequence 
compartmentalization (P<0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). As shown in Panel D, 
Participant A07 had polyclonal rebound of VRC01-sensitive virus. As shown in Panels E 
and F, pre-ART and rebound Env pseudotyped virus from the eight participants with 
available samples were compared for changes in neutralization sensitivity by IC50 (truncated 
at 25 μg per milliliter) (Panel E) and 80% inhibitory concentration (IC80) (truncated at 50 μg 
per milliliter) (Panel F) with the use of multilevel random-effects models (random intercept 
and slope) to account for multiple clones per participant at each time point. A two-sided P 
value for the estimated difference in pre-ART and rebound resistance was calculated. Mean 
titers are shown for pre-ART virus on the left and rebound virus on the right.

 Figure 4. Characterization of Autologous, Replication-Competent HIV Isolates before and after 
Infusions of VRC01 and Discontinuation of ART in the NIH Trial
Panel A shows neutralization of preinfusion autologous viral isolates by VRC01 and other 
monoclonal antibodies. Susceptibility of preinfusion infectious isolates obtained from eight 
trial participants to neutralization by VRC01 and other broadly neutralizing antibodies 
(3BNC117, 10–1074, and PGT121) and anti-CD4 antibody (UB-421) is shown. The percent 
suppression of HIV was calculated with the use of the following formula: (1 − [luciferase 
activity in the presence of test antibody ÷ luciferase activity in the presence of control 
antibody IgG]) × 100. Luciferase activity was expressed in relative light units. Gray 
horizontal bars indicate mean values. P values were computed with the use of a paired 
permutation test. Panel B shows neutralization of preinfusion and postinfusion viral isolates 
by VRC01 in seven trial participants from whom infectious isolates could be recovered at 
both time points. Gray horizontal bars indicate mean values. The P value for each participant 
was computed with the use of the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test.
