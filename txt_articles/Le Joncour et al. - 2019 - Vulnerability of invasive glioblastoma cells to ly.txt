Abstract
The current clinical care of glioblastomas leaves behind invasive,
radio- and chemo-resistant cells. We recently identified mammary-
derived growth inhibitor (MDGI/FABP3) as a biomarker for invasive
gliomas. Here, we demonstrate a novel function for MDGI in the
maintenance of lysosomal membrane integrity, thus rendering inva-
sive glioma cells unexpectedly vulnerable to lysosomal membrane
destabilization. MDGI silencing impaired trafficking of polyunsatu-
rated fatty acids into cells resulting in significant alterations in the
lipid composition of lysosomal membranes, and subsequent death of
the patient-derived glioma cells via lysosomal membrane permeabi-
lization (LMP). In a preclinical model, treatment of glioma-bearing
mice with an antihistaminergic LMP-inducing drug efficiently eradi-
cated invasive glioma cells and secondary tumours within the brain.
This unexpected fragility of the aggressive infiltrating cells to LMP
provides new opportunities for clinical interventions, such as re-
positioning of an established antihistamine drug, to eradicate the
inoperable, invasive, and chemo-resistant glioma cells from sustain-
ing disease progression and recurrence.

Introduction
Gliomas constitute approximately 30% of all primary nervous
system
tumours
and
80%
of
all
malignant
brain
tumours
(Goodenberger
&
Jenkins,
2012).
Glioblastoma
is
the
most
frequent, aggressive and lethal type of gliomas. Glioblastomas
harbour a dense abnormal vasculature, display large hypoxic and
necrotic areas and contain extensively proliferating tumour cells
with the intrinsic ability to disseminate and colonize the brain far
beyond the primary tumour mass. The current standard of care,
comprising
surgery,
radio-
and
chemotherapy,
provides
only
modest
improvement
in
patient
survival,
and
the
prognosis
remains dismal (Weller et al, 2017). This is due to (i) difficulty of
complete surgical resection of the tumour, (ii) intratumoural
heterogeneity and presence of multidrug-resistant cells and stem
cell-like glioma cells responsible for the tumour maintenance and
relapse, and (iii) the sheltering effect of the blood–brain-barrier
(BBB), which efficiently prevents access of many systemic anti-
cancer agents into the brain. Most probably, different approaches
are required to eradicate the invasive cells and the cells that reside
within the tumour bulk (Guishard et al, 2018). Thus, novel thera-
peutic approaches for glioblastomas are urgently needed (Reifen-
berger et al, 2017).
We have previously identified mammary-derived growth inhi-
bitor (MDGI) as a glioma biomarker expressed in tumour cells and
their associated vasculature (Hyvo
¨nen et al, 2014). MDGI, also
known as heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP/FABP3),
belongs to the family of fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) that
facilitate the intracellular transport of fatty acids (Glatz & van der
Vusse, 1996). Both tumour-suppressive (Nevo et al, 2010) and
tumour-promoting (Hashimoto et al, 2004; Sumantran et al, 2015)
functions, depending on the cancer type, have been reported for
MDGI. In glioma cells, MDGI has been found to mediate lipid
droplet formation and fatty acid uptake (Bensaad et al, 2014) with
the highest binding affinities to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs;
Richieri et al, 2000).

 Here, we used cohorts of patients operated for primary glioma
and patient-derived human spheroid cultures to examine the func-
tion of MDGI. Primary gliomas abundantly expressed MDGI, and
high expression was associated with poor patient survival. MDGI
was upregulated by hypoxia, and its overexpression enhanced the
invasive growth of glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Surpris-
ingly, MDGI silencing compromised spheroid growth and glioma cell
survival via lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). Lipid
analyses of the lysosomal membranes showed that linoleic acid
(18:2n-6), the major PUFA in the cell culture medium, was ineffi-
ciently incorporated into lysosomal phospholipids in MDGI-silenced
cells. This led to biased molecular species composition of the phos-
pholipids, in conjunction with reduced degree of lysosomal ceramide
unsaturation. In addition, we show that glioma cells were more
sensitive than normal cells to an LMP-inducing drug, the antihis-
tamine clemastine, in vitro, and that clemastine treatment eradicated
the invasive glioma cells in vivo. Our results suggest that MDGI
expression is crucial for glioma cell viability and an important regu-
lator of lysosomal integrity. The vulnerability of invasive glioma
cells to lysosomal membrane destabilization opens new opportuni-
ties for LMP-inducing drugs as a promising treatment option.
Results
High MDGI expression correlates with poor glioma
patient survival
Our previous results show that MDGI is expressed in a grade-depen-
dent manner in human gliomas and its expression positively corre-
lates with the histologic grade (Hyvo
¨nen et al, 2014). To study the
potential correlation of MDGI expression with clinicopathological
variables and patient survival, we performed immunohistochem-
istry for MDGI in human tumour microarrays (TMAs) consisting of
lower WHO grade (grade II–III) gliomas and glioblastomas (grade
IV; Fig 1A), and scored the staining intensity separately in tumour
cells and tumour-associated endothelial cells. Approximately 50%
of both grade II–III gliomas and glioblastomas expressed moderate
to high levels of MDGI, accompanied with positive vascular staining
for MDGI (Appendix Tables S1 and S2). Only 5% of all gliomas
(n = 6/122) showed no detectable MDGI expression.
In the
glioblastoma specimens, MDGI expression correlated with the pres-
ence of the CD117/C-Kit receptor in the perinecrotic tumour regions
(P = 0.006; Appendix Table S2). MDGI expression did not associate
with the expression of EGFR (P > 0.999), EGFRvIII (P = 0.613),
phosphorylated EGFR (Tyr-1173; P > 0.999) or p53 (P = 0.499;
Appendix Table S2).
In lower grade gliomas (grade II–III), moderate to high MDGI
levels
significantly
associated
both
with
poor
glioma-specific
(HR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.08–3.16; P = 0.022; Appendix Fig S1A) and
poor overall survival of patients (HR = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.19–3.28;
P = 0.007; Fig 1B) as compared to patients with negative or low
tumour
MDGI
expression.
Multivariate
Cox
hazards
analysis
showed that both MDGI expression and high tumour grade indepen-
dently associated with unfavourable overall survival, increasing the
risk of death by the factor of 2 (Table 1). In glioblastomas, tumour
MDGI
levels
were
not
associated
with
overall
survival
(Appendix Fig S1B).
Next, we studied MDGI/FABP3 expression in human glioma speci-
mens and its association with survival using the GlioVis dataportal
(http://gliovis.bioinfo.cnio.es). We analysed MDGI/FABP3 expres-
sion in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA seq datasets for
glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and for glioblastoma and low-grade
glioma (TCGA GBMLGG). In the TCGA GBMLGG dataset, high MDGI
mRNA expression associated with poor survival (Fig 1C), while no
significant association between MDGI expression and patient survival
was observed in the TCGA GBM dataset (Appendix Fig S1C). Thus,
these results corroborate our immunohistochemistry results. When
we analysed MDGI expression in the different histological glioma
subclasses (grades II–IV), significantly more MDGI was expressed in
glioblastomas compared to the lower grade gliomas (Appendix Fig
S1D). When different glioblastoma subtypes were analysed, highest
MDGI expression was observed in the mesenchymal subtype
compared to the classical or pro-neural ones (Fig 1D). However, it
did not reach the statistical significance. Moreover, the vast majority
(94%) of MDGI-expressing glioblastomas displayed the non-G-CIMP
phenotype (Appendix Fig S1E). In addition, in the lower grade
gliomas, no significant difference in MDGI expression was observed
between the IDH wt and mutant tumours (Appendix Fig S1F).
We then analysed MDGI expression using the Ivy Glioblastoma
Atlas project (Ivy_GAP; http://glioblastoma.alleninstitute.org) RNA
seq dataset, which maps gene expression across the anatomic struc-
tures and putative cancer stem cell clusters in glioblastomas. Inter-
estingly, MDGI mRNA was expressed at significantly higher levels
in the leading edge of the tumour and in infiltrative tumour cells
compared to the microvascular proliferation, pseudopalisading cells
or cells in the tumour mass (Fig 1E). In addition to the patient tissue
biopsies, MDGI was expressed in all seven distinct patient-derived
spheroid cultures containing stem cell-like glioma cells, whereas it
was very low in 4 of 5 adherent cell lines studied (Fig 1F).
Our immunohistochemical results in clinical tumour samples
revealed a correlation between MDGI expression and perinecrotic C-
Kit, which is an indirect hypoxia marker in glioblastomas (Sihto et al,
2007). In patient-derived BT12 and BT13 spheroids, MDGI expression
was high in conjunction with strong expression of hypoxia-inducible
factor 1a (HIF-1a; Fig 1G). Addition of medium supplemented with
serum led to drastic reduction (70–90%) in both MDGI and HIF-1a
levels (Fig 1G) and shifted the growth from spheres to adherent
monolayers. Moreover, MDGI expression was highly increased by
hypoxia in adherent BT5, BT5R and U87MG cell lines (Fig 1H). No
increase in MDGI expression in response to hypoxia was observed in
BT12 and BT13 spheroid cultures, which already express high levels
of MDGI and HIF-1a under normoxic conditions (Fig 1G and H).
These results in glioma cells link MDGI induction to hypoxia.
MDGI overexpression promotes glioma cell invasion
As MDGI expression was associated with glioma cell invasion and
poor patient survival, we next studied MDGI function in glioma cell
growth and invasion. We overexpressed MDGI as a GFP-fusion
protein (MDGI-GFP) in U87MG cells since they express low endoge-
nous levels of MDGI and form local, non-invasive tumours follow-
ing intracranial injection in preclinical models (Lee et al, 2006;
Xie et al, 2015). While MDGI overexpression did not affect cell
proliferation (Fig EV1A), it significantly enhanced colony formation,

 independent growth of the MDGI-overexpressing cells (Fig EV1B
and C). In addition, MDGI-overexpressing spheroids grew more
invasively in an ex vivo brain slice model than the control cells
(Fig EV1D and E). Moreover, the intracranial U87MG-MDGI-GFP
xenografts grew invasively (Fig 2A and B), formed secondary
tumours (diameter > 300 lm) in the brain (Fig 2C, D and G) and
displayed vascular co-option (angiotropic tumours with diame-
ter < 300 lm, Fig 2E, F and H) unlike the control GFP-expressing
U87MG-derived xenografts that only formed well-delineated masses.
Next, we overexpressed MDGI in the LN229 glioblastoma cells that
in addition to formation of the primary tumour mass invade into the
brain
parenchyma
and
form
secondary
vasculature-associated
angiotropic tumours. Also, in this model, high MDGI expression
significantly promoted the invasion and formation of angiotropic
tumours (Fig 2I–P) consistent with the results obtained with the
U87MG-MDGI-GFP xenograft model.
MDGI silencing reduces glioblastoma cell viability
To investigate the functions of the endogenous MDGI in glioblas-
toma cells, we silenced MDGI in patient-derived BT12 and BT13
cells using two different shRNAs (shMDGI1 and shMDGI2). The
shMDGI1 resulted in undetectable MDGI levels, while shMDGI2
showed approximately 60–70% knockdown efficiency (Fig EV2A
and B). MDGI silencing caused a dramatic change in the cell
morphology abrogating the formation of the large multicellular
spheroids (Fig 3A). Moreover, the self-renewal ability in methylcel-
lulose (Fig 3B and C) and the anchorage-independent growth in soft
agar (Fig EV2C) of the MDGI-silenced cells were severely compro-
mised. Surprisingly, MDGI silencing inhibited proliferation of both
BT12 and BT13 cells (Figs 3D and EV2D) and dramatically reduced
their viability (Fig EV2E). When the MDGI-silenced cells were
injected intracranially into immunocompromised mice, no tumour
formation was observed, while the control shRNA (Scr)-infected
cells formed invasive tumours (Figs 3E and F, and Appendix Fig
S2A–C). These results demonstrate a dose-dependent effect of MDGI
silencing on glioblastoma cell growth and viability.
MDGI has been previously shown to affect EGFR trafficking
(Nevo et al, 2009), inhibition of which can induce glioma cell apop-
tosis (Ghildiyal et al, 2013; Kaluzova et al, 2015). Thus, we investi-
gated the EGFR expression and pathway activity in glioma cells.
Only the patient-derived glioblastoma BT11, BT12 and BT13 spher-
oids expressed high levels of EGFR (Appendix Fig S2D). As
expected, BT12 and BT13 cells were highly sensitive to the
commonly used EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib (Wakeling et al, 2002).
While 0.4 lM of gefitinib was able to kill up to 50% of the BT12
and BT13 cells, 23.5-fold higher concentration (9.4 lM) was
required to kill 50% of the ZH305 cells that expressed low levels of
EGFR (Appendix Fig S2E). EGFR expression was significantly
reduced in response to MDGI silencing in BT12 and BT13 cells both
at the mRNA and protein levels (Appendix Fig S2F and G).
However, MDGI silencing also induced death of the ZH305 spher-
oids expressing low levels of EGFR, suggesting that MDGI silencing-
triggered cell death was independent of EGFR expression (Fig EV2F
and G).

 MDGI silencing induces caspase-independent death of glioma cells
To further examine the mechanism underlying the reduced viability of
MDGI-silenced cells, we assessed the Annexin V binding to the cell
surface-exposed phosphatidylserines as a marker of cell death (Koop-
man et al, 1994). MDGI silencing significantly increased the binding of
Annexin V to MDGI-silenced BT12 cells compared to the control cells,
indicating increased apoptosis (Fig 4A and B). To study the intracellu-
lar pathways that could contribute to this, we analysed the expression
of apoptosis-associated proteins at various time points after lentiviral
MDGI silencing. Levels of the phosphorylated and total p53 and the
pro-apoptotic protein BAD first remained stable but eventually
decreased 5–6 days after transduction (Appendix Fig S3A). Surpris-
ingly, the amounts of total caspase-3 and its cleaved, activated form
also decreased 5–6 days after silencing (Appendix Fig S3A). We also
studied the expression of selected proteins of the key signalling path-
ways at different time points after MDGI silencing using Western blot.
In MDGI-silenced cells, p27 levels were elevated and the Erk1/2 phos-
phorylation was significantly induced, while the phosphorylated AKT
was decreased already at day three after silencing (Appendix Fig S3B).
In addition, in an antibody array of apoptosis-associated proteins,
levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis protein (XIAP) decreased in MDGI-silenced cells. We also
observed a decrease in the active caspase-3 level. However, the fold-
change (0.61) exceeded the threshold, and therefore, it was considered
as unchanged. On the other hand, levels of the HTRA serine protease
were elevated, while levels of pro-apoptotic proteins BAD and BAX or
cytochrome C were unchanged by MDGI silencing (fold-change less
than 0.6 or more than 1.5; Appendix Fig S3C and D). Furthermore,
MDGI silencing-induced cell death could not be rescued by siRNA
silencing of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD (Appendix Fig S3E and F).
This suggests that apoptosis in the MDGI-silenced cells was not medi-
ated by caspase activation.
MDGI silencing induces lysosomal membrane
permeabilization (LMP)
Since apoptosis in MDGI-silenced cells was not mediated by caspase
activation, we studied the effects of MDGI silencing on LMP. This
alternative cell death pathway leads to release of lysosomal hydro-
lases into the cytosol, and depending on the extent of the release
can ultimately lead to lysosomal cell death with necrotic or apop-
totic features (Aits & Jaattela, 2013). LMP induction can be easily
visualized as a change in galectin-1 localization from a diffuse cyto-
plasmic to a punctate staining pattern (Aits et al, 2015). As a
control, we first treated the glioma spheroids with an LMP-inducing
agent, L-leucine O-methyl (LLOMe; Uchimoto et al, 1999), which
caused increased formation of galectin-1 (LGALS1)-positive puncta
(Fig 4C and D). Similarly, we detected a significant increase in the
number of LGALS1-positive punctate staining in the MDGI-silenced
patient-derived BT12 and BT13 cells (Fig 4E–I). In addition, a signif-
icant fraction of the MDGI-silenced cells was already dead at the
time of analysis, as revealed by the quantification of the number of
fragmented nuclei devoid of LGALS1-staining (Fig 4J). LGALS1-
puncta co-localized with the lysosomal marker protein, lysosome-
associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), verifying the lysosomal
localization of LGALS1 (Fig EV3A). Moreover, the activity of lysoso-
mal cathepsin B was significantly increased in the cytoplasm of the
MDGI-silenced cells (Fig 4K). Interestingly, when we cultured the
BT12 and BT13 cells with the pan-cathepsin inhibitor (K777),
survival of MDGI-silenced cells was partially rescued (Fig 4L). Only
11% of the MDGI-silenced cells were alive at day 5 after shRNA
transduction compared to the control cells, while 41% of the MDGI-
silenced cells were alive when cultured in the presence of K777
compared to the control cells (Fig 4L).
MDGI silencing changed lysosomal membrane lipid composition
To investigate whether MDGI silencing would affect the lysosomal
membrane lipid composition due to its fatty acid binding and trans-
port function, we enriched lysosomes by density gradient ultracen-
trifugation (Fig EV4B) and analysed the extracted lysosomal lipids
by mass spectrometry. The lipid classes with most evident composi-
tional differences between the MDGI-silenced and control cells were
phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and cera-
mide. PC and PE are the bulk lipids of the membrane that together
comprise about 70% of the lysosomal membrane phospholipids
(Kobayashi et al, 2002). Lysosomes of the MDGI-silenced cells

 contained decreased proportions of di-unsaturated PC and PE
species compared to the lysosomes of the control cells (Fig 5A),
especially the 36:2 was diminished due to the silencing (Fig 5B). At
the same time, the proportions of monounsaturated PC and PE
species (34:1 and 36:1) increased and those of saturated PC species
(30:0 and 32:0) decreased compared to the lysosomes of the control
cells (Fig 5B). While no differences were observed in the total
proportions of the more highly unsaturated PC and PE species (dou-
ble bond content 3–7) in response to MDGI silencing (Fig 5A),
certain polyunsaturated species with 3 or 4 double bonds were
increased (PE 38:3, 40:3, 36:4, 38:4) in conjunction with decrease in
species with 5–7 double bonds (PE 40:5, 40:7; Fig 5B).
Ceramides
(Cer),
regarded
as
important
determinants
of
membrane permeability, have only one N-linked acyl chain, which
commonly is either saturated or monounsaturated. Lysosomes of
the MDGI-silenced cells showed a marked compositional change of
ceramide species (Fig 5C). In the control cell lysosomes, Cer 24:1
dominated by threefold over Cer 24:0, while in the lysosomes of the
MDGI-silenced cells these two Cer species were found in equal
amounts (Fig 5C and D). The consequent impairment of the elastic
properties of membrane bilayer (Bruno et al, 2007; Pan et al, 2009)
probably contributed to the found leakage of lysosomal membranes.
Clemastine evokes glioma cell death
Inspired by MDGI silencing-triggered cell death via LMP, we
searched for an LMP-inducing drug that could be safely used in
preclinical studies. A recent report by Ellegaard et al (2016) identi-
fied cationic amphiphilic (CAD) antihistamines as drugs able to
provoke LMP. Therefore, we chose clemastine (Tavegil
TM), a first-
generation histamine H1 blocking antihistamine CAD, as the BBB-
permeable drug for our experiments. The patient-derived BT12,
BT13 and ZH305 glioblastoma cells, as well as various normal cells,
were treated with increasing concentrations of clemastine (1–5 lM).
The highest concentration killed all the cells in vitro already by day
3 (Fig 6A and B). About 90% cell death was observed with 2 lM
clemastine concentration, while 1 lM clemastine concentration
killed 50% of BT12 and BT13 cells and 64% of ZH305 cells at day 4
(Fig 6A). No significant cell death was observed when normal
human endothelial cells (HuAR2T), normal human astrocytes
(NHA), embryonic kidney (HEK293T; Fig 6B) or murine brain
endothelial (Fig EV3C) cells were treated at 1–2 lM of clemastine,
suggesting a therapeutic window for clemastine treatment in
gliomas. In accordance, already 1 lM of clemastine induced punc-
tate localization of the galectin-1 in BT12, BT13 and ZH305 cells
(Fig 6C), whereas no galectin-1 re-localization was observed in
HuAR2T, NHA or HEK293T cells (Fig 6D). Galectin-1 relocation into
the lysosomes cells was confirmed by co-localization with the
LAMP2 (Fig EV3D). Clemastine treatment had no effect on MDGI
levels in glioblastoma cells in vitro (Appendix Fig S4A), suggesting
that the clemastine effect is not upstream of MDGI.
The preclinical evaluation of clemastine was performed in
patient-derived xenografts orthotopically implanted in immunocom-
promised mice. We chose three different patient-derived glioblas-
toma models with different intracranial growth patterns: BT13 cells
grow as an angiogenic non-invasive tumour, ZH305 cells grow
highly diffusively without formation of tumour bulk, and BT12
cells show a mixed phenotype with tumour bulk and invasive
growth. After 15 days of tumour growth, we started intraperitoneal
injections of clemastine at a dose of 100 mg/kg on the first day
followed by 50 mg/kg daily injections for 12 additional days. The
vehicle (saline solution) was administered under the same modali-
ties to the control cohort. As illustrated in Fig 7A, clemastine
provoked a profound alteration in the growth pattern of BT12-,
BT12
Scr-
and
ZH305-derived
xenografts.
No
difference
was
observed in the BT13-derived xenografts that form bulky angio-
genic tumours without invasive tumour cells (Fig 7A). The MDGI-
silenced BT12 cells did not form tumours in vivo (Figs 3E, and
EV4A and B). The number and distance of invasive cells that had
escaped the primary tumour and disseminated into the brain were
dramatically reduced (Fig 7B and C) to the extent that in the
ZH305 model, no tumour cells were detected (Figs 7A and EV4C).
In addition, clemastine treatment significantly reduced the number
of secondary tumours in BT12 and BT12 Scr xenografts (Fig 7D).
In addition, clemastine treatment led to a nearly complete loss of
co-opting angiotropic tumour cells (Fig 7E). To further evaluate the
anti-tumour effect of clemastine, we analysed the number of apop-
totic cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end
labelling (TUNEL) in control and clemastine-treated BT12-xenograft
bearing animals. Whole-brain quantification revealed that the lead-
ing, migratory edge of the tumour was more susceptible to the
cytotoxic effect of clemastine (Fig 7F and G) than the cells inside
the tumour mass. As a consequence, clemastine-treated animals
showed significantly prolonged survival (P = 0.044) compared to
the
controls
(Fig 7H).
To
study
whether
clemastine
affected
galectin-1 localization as a sign of LMP induction also in vivo, we
analysed the BT12-derived control and clemastine-treated xeno-
grafts by using immunohistological and Western blot analyses.
Clemastine induced re-localization of galectin-1 into a more punc-
tate pattern (Fig EV4D and E) but did not affect the galectin-1
expression levels (Fig EV4F). No cytotoxic effect of clemastine
apart from the transient drowsiness of the animals following drug
injections was observed during the treatment. We weighted the
animals during the treatment and post-mortem measured selected
organs’ weight. The vehicle-treated animal lost weight at the end of
the treatment probably due to the tumour burden (Appendix Fig
S4B), but no significant difference in the organ:body weight ratios
was observed between the vehicle- and clemastine-treated animals
(Appendix Fig S4C–F).
Discussion
There is an unmet need for novel therapeutic strategies to treat
gliomas, making the characterization of proteins involved in disease
progression highly imperative. Here, we examined the expression of
a potential glioma biomarker, MDGI (Hyvo
¨nen et al, 2014), in WHO
grade II–III glioma and glioblastoma (grade IV) specimens, publicly
available datasets as well as in patient-derived and commercially
available glioblastoma cell lines. We show that high MDGI expres-
sion associated with unfavourable patient survival and was crucial
for glioblastoma cell viability. We further describe a novel function
for MDGI in the maintenance of lysosomal membrane integrity and
show the exceptional vulnerability of invasive glioma cells to desta-
bilization of lysosomes. In addition, we show that antihistaminergic
drug clemastine eradicated invasive glioblastoma cells in vivo via

 induction of lysosomal membrane permeabilization and prolonged
survival of glioblastoma-bearing mice.
Although MDGI expression has been linked to tumour-suppres-
sive properties in breast cancer (Nevo et al, 2010), in gastric carci-
nomas MDGI associated with poor patient survival (Hashimoto
et al, 2004) and in melanomas, its expression was upregulated
during disease progression (Sumantran et al, 2015). Here, we show
that MDGI was frequently expressed in human gliomas, and high
MDGI expression significantly correlated with poor survival. These
results suggest that the effect of MDGI on tumorigenesis may be
tissue-dependent and cancer type-dependent. We detected high
MDGI expression also in various patient-derived, cancer stem cell-
enriched spheroids but not in adherent cells under normoxia.
However, hypoxia stimulated MDGI expression in adherent cells.
This is in agreement with previous data that showed upregulation of
MDGI expression during hypoxia (Bensaad et al, 2014). MDGI over-
expression in glioma cells significantly promoted their anchorage-
independent growth and invasion both in vitro and in vivo, suggest-
ing a functional role for MDGI in the invasive growth. Consistent
with this, MDGI/FABP3 expression was highest in the mesenchymal
subtype of glioblastomas (GlioVis) as well as in the leading edge
and infiltrating tumour cells based on tumour structure-specific
mRNA expression dataset of glioblastomas (Ivy_GAP).
Interestingly, our results demonstrate that MDGI expression is
crucial for glioma cell survival, and MDGI depletion induces
lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). LMP is an intracel-
lular cell death pathway that can be either caspase-independent
or caspase-dependent and it can occur either up- or downstream
of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization depending on the
cell type and/or LMP-inducer (Boya et al, 2003; Aits & Jaattela,
2013; Huai et al, 2013; Shen et al, 2013). As a consequence,
LMP
results
in
irreversible
leakage
of
lysosomal
proteolytic
enzymes to the cytoplasm, where they digest vital proteins and
intracellular organelles (Kirkegaard & Jaattela, 2009). Considering
the function of MDGI as a fatty acid binding protein, we hypoth-
esized that
LMP
may
be
induced by
changes
in
lysosomal
membrane lipid composition. Indeed, MDGI has been reported to
bind efficiently the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; Richieri
et al, 2000), and in the MDGI knockout mice, incorporation of
PUFAs into phospholipid membranes was reduced (Murphy et al,
2005). Our lipid analyses show that MDGI silencing impaired
trafficking of polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA) into cells resulting
in significant alterations in the lipid composition of lysosomal
membranes. Among the FAs preferred by MDGI is linoleic acid
18:2n-6, which cannot be synthesized de novo by the cells but
has to be received from external sources. In fact, 18:2n-6 was
the main FA component in cell culture media used in this study
suggesting that MDGI silencing impaired the uptake and incorpo-
ration of the 18:2 FA chain into the lysosomal phospholipids.
Mammalian cells actively regulate their membrane fluidity, and
when the supply of exogenous PUFAs diminishes, the endoge-
nous production of monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) from the
saturated
FA
(SFA)
precursors
by
desaturases
is
activated
(Ntambi, 1999). In line with this, the lysosomal membranes of
MDGI-silenced cells contained larger proportions of MUFAs and
fewer SFAs than the control lysosomes, which can be seen as
fluidity compensation among these membrane bulk phospho-
lipids. However, it should be recalled that MUFAs cannot replace
the essential PUFAs in their specific biological functions, and it
is likely that this compositional bias caused by MDGI silencing
hampered lysosomal membrane integrity, dynamics and vesicle
secretion, and changed the precursor pool of signalling molecules
(Erazo-Oliveras et al, 2018).
Membrane ceramide content has been considered as an impor-
tant factor defining membrane permeability, albeit the mechanistic
explanations vary from pore induction to gradually increasing
defects in lipid packing (Artetxe et al, 2017). The lysosomes of
the MDGI-silenced cells showed no marked change in the total
ceramide
content
or
their
acyl
chain
length
distribution,
commonly attributed to cell fate decisions and induction of
apoptosis (Grosch et al, 2012). Our data, however, identified
ceramides as potential mediators of LMP, since the degree of
unsaturation of the lysosomal ceramides (ratio of Cer 24:1 to Cer
24:0) markedly decreased upon MDGI silencing. These observed

 changes in the ceramide FA saturation are plausibly large enough
to
affect
lateral
packing
and
dynamics
of
the
lysosomal
membrane. Loss of the unsaturated Cer 24:1 species from the
lysosomal membrane leaves behind a membrane enriched with
more rigid saturated 24:0, which probably made the membrane
less elastic and prone to leakage.
In addition to the impaired membrane integrity and elasticity,
activation of Erk in the MDGI-silenced cells could play a role in the
process, since phosphorylated Erk [besides being linked to apoptosis
induction and cell cycle arrest (Woessmann et al, 2002)] has also
been shown to enhance cysteine cathepsin expression and activity,
sensitizing cells to LMP (Fehrenbacher et al, 2008). In addition to
the LMP, we also observed decreased activity of the AKT kinase
(the master regulator of various cell survival pathways; Chang et al,
2003), downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins XIAP and survivin,
which have been linked to caspase-independent apoptosis (Kang
et al, 2008) as well as an upregulation of the pro-apoptotic serine
protease HTRA (Eckelman et al, 2006). HTRA contributes to cell
death by downregulating XIAP protein levels (Vande Walle et al,
2008) and decreases the chemoresistance of colon cancer cells
(Xiong et al, 2017).
A very recent study by Guishard et al showed an evident
translational gap in the past clinical trials of glioma: attempts to
include drugs that are able to overcome the chemoresistance of
glioma stem cells and cross the BBB were not made. However, in
the ongoing trials, this has been taken better into account, but
there is still room for improvement (Guishard et al, 2018). LMP
induction has been shown to re-sensitize multidrug-resistant cells
to chemotherapy and shown efficacy against apoptosis-resistant
cancer cells (Ellegaard et al, 2013; Groth-Pedersen & Jaattela,
2013). LMP induction in glioblastoma treatment has not been
widely studied, but several studies have recently characterized
the mechanism of action of some novel chemotherapeutics and
shown that lysosomal dysfunction is a major contributor in drug-
mediated cancer cell death (Gonzalez et al, 2012; Gutierrez et al,
2016; Jiang et al, 2016). Among the drugs currently on the
market, cationic amphiphilic (CAD) antihistamines induce lysoso-
mal cell death. Moreover, the use of the CAD antihistamines was
associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality among
cancer patients when compared with the use of non-CAD antihis-
tamines and adjusted for potential confounders (Ellegaard et al,
2016). We chose an older generation CAD antihistamine, clemas-
tine, due to its ability to cross the BBB, to test the sensitivity of
our patient-derived glioblastoma cells towards drug-induced LMP.
Clemastine is devoid of neurotoxic effects (Liu et al, 2016) even
though it causes reported fatigue-induced side effects common to
many of the antihistaminergic drugs (Verster & Volkerts, 2004).
Moreover, clemastine is FDA-approved and currently under clini-
cal evaluation for multiple sclerosis (Green et al, 2017). We
observed a dramatic loss of the glioblastoma cell viability that
was associated with the loss of lysosomal membrane integrity at
doses that did not affect the proliferation or viability of several
normal cells in vitro. When we evaluated the preclinical efficacy

 glioblastoma xenografts was significantly prolonged compared to
controls due to the eradication of the invasive glioma cells. Both
the co-opted, angiotropic growth and single-cell invasion, as well
as collective migration of glioblastoma cells, were inhibited by
the systemic delivery of clemastine leading to a nearly complete
loss of disseminated cells. The observed cytotoxic effect of clem-
astine targeted preferentially glioblastoma cells in the vicinity of
functional blood vessels and at the leading edge of the primary
tumour mass leading to eradication of the secondary tumours. It
is known that intratumoural vasculature in glioblastoma is highly
aberrant and non-functional (McDonald & Choyke, 2003). Simi-
larly
to
challenges
in
delivering
systemically
administered
chemotherapeutics (Bianco et al, 2017), clemastine delivery into
the primary tumour mass may partially have been compromised
due to poorly functional tumour blood vessel network. Lack of
clemastine efficacy in reduction of the primary tumour volume
may also be due to the dense connective network within the
tumour bulk that has been shown to provide exceptional protec-
tion of glioblastoma cells to radiotherapy (Osswald et al, 2015).
Many triggers of the LMP are known (Cesen et al, 2012; Aits &
Jaattela, 2013; Appelqvist et al, 2013), but genes and cellular path-
ways that regulate the lysosomal membrane integrity remain poorly
understood. Our study demonstrates the crucial role of MDGI in
glioma cell survival, linking this fatty acid binding protein to the
maintenance of lysosomal membrane integrity. The inoperable,
highly invasive and chemo-resistant glioma stem cell-like cells
showed an unexpected fragility towards LMP. Thus, our study
provides a potential answer to the clinical challenge for the manage-
ment of the cells that eventually will lead to the recurrence of the
disease. These results also suggest re-positioning of an old drug with
a new indication. More widely, LMP-inducing agents should be
considered as a possible novel treatment option for gliomas.

Hospital, Finland. The cohort has been described elsewhere (Joen-
suu et al, 2005; Puputti et al, 2006). Briefly, glioblastoma TMA was
composed of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumours
derived from 43 craniotomy patients, subsequently diagnosed with
primary glioblastoma between October 2000 and December 2003.
The median survival time of the patients was 9 months (range 1–
40 months) as calculated from the date of the diagnosis to the date
of death. All patients died due to glioblastoma during follow-up. In
seven cases, tissue microarray sample was missing or staining was
not informative leaving 36 patients in the series.
FFPE grade II–III glioma TMAs were prepared from the tumours
of 122 patients who were operated for a primary glioma at the
Helsinki University Hospital between 1979 and 2000. In 10 cases,
tissue microarray sample was missing or staining was not informa-
tive leaving 112 patients for the analysis. Thirty-three of the
tumours (30%) were diagnosed as astrocytoma, 16 (14%) as
anaplastic astrocytoma, 36 (32%) as glioblastoma, 18 (16%) as
oligodendroglioma and 9 (8%) as oligoastrocytoma. The association
of MDGI with clinical and histopathological factors was studied
from 76 low-grade samples, excluding glioblastoma patients, and
the median follow-up time after surgery was 6.0 years (range 0.6–
17.0 years). Ten of the patients lived at the end of the follow-up,
while 58 and eight patients died from glioma or other causes,
respectively.
Immunohistochemistry and evaluation of immunostaining
The immunohistochemical stainings using antibodies against SCF/
Kit, CD117/KIT-receptor, CD133, EGFR, EGFRvIII, p53 and phos-
phorylated
EGFR
(Tyr1173)
have
been
described
elsewhere
(Joensuu et al, 2005; Puputti et al, 2006). For immunohistochemical
analyses, MDGI expression was detected from the FFPE-samples
using TSA kit (Perkin Elmer) according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The antigen was retrieved with heat treatment in citrate buffer
(1.8 mM citric acid, 8.2 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0). The sections
were blocked for 10 min with (10 min with 3% H2O2 in methanol,
30 min with TNB-buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl,
0.5% blocking reagent from the TSA kit) and incubated with
primary antibody overnight at 4°C and with biotinylated secondary
antibody (goat anti-rat immunoglobulin, Dako). The staining was
amplified by using SA-HRP and biotinylated tyramide and finally
visualized with AEC (0.95 M 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole, 6% N,N
dimethylformamide,
94%
sodium
acetate,
0.01%
H2O2).
The
sections were counterstained with Mayer’s haematoxylin.
MDGI expression was evaluated blinded to the clinical data and
scored as follows: 0, all tumour cells negative; 1, low expression in
tumour cells (5–50%); 2, moderate expression in ≥ 50% of tumour
cells; and 3, high expression in ≥ 50% of tumour cells. For the
statistical analyses, tumours with MDGI expression scored as 0 and
1 were grouped together as well as tumours with MDGI expression
scored as 2 and 3. Vascular expression of MDGI was scored as
follows: 0, no MDGI-positive vessels; 1, one or more MDGI-positive
vessels.
Patient-derived cells
The glioma patient samples were obtained from surgeries (Kuopio
University Hospital, Finland) during years 2010–2011. BT5 cells
were obtained from a human gliosarcoma and BT5R cells from its
relapse. BT11 cells are from a glioblastoma-containing oligocompo-
nents, and BT12 and BT13 cells are from glioblastoma patients.
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and that the exper-
iments conformed to the principles set out in the WMA Declaration
of Helsinki and the Department of Health and Human Services
Belmont Report.
Tumours were collected into solution [0.1% BSA (Biowest), 1 M
glucose in PBS] centrifuged for 1 min at 250 × g and suspended into
trypsin-hyaluronidase-kynurenic acid mixture (1.33% trypsin, 0.7%

were incubated at 37°C for 15–30 min and triturated with a pipette
to break down tissues clumps. After filtering through 100-lm nylon
mesh filter, the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 250 × g. Cell
pellets were suspended into sucrose solution (30.8% glucose in
0.5× HBSS) and centrifuged again for 10 min at 500 × g. Cells
were suspended in 2 ml of 1× EBSS medium and pipetted on top of

 15 ml of BSA-EBSS-HEPES solution (4% BSA, 1 M HEPES in
1× EBSS). After centrifugation for 7 min at 350 × g, the cells were
suspended into the complete growth medium. Trypsin, hyaluroni-
dase, kynurenic acid and DNase were obtained from Sigma. HBSS
and EBSS were obtained from Gibco and 1 M HEPES-buffer from
Lonza.
Cell culture
The patient-derived brain tumour cells (BT3, BT11, BT12, BT13,
BT5, BT5R) were maintained for up to 20 passages in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium with Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12,
Gibco) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 2% B27-supplement
(Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 lg/ml streptomycin, 0.01 lg/
ml recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-basic (FGF-b, Pepro-
tech), 0.02 lg/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor
(EGF, Peprotech) and 15 mM HEPES-buffer. The ZH161, ZH305 and
S24 were maintained for up to 10 passages in phenol red-free Neuro-
basal medium (Gibco) supplemented with the same ingredients as
described above except 0.02 lg/ml of FGF-b was used. We con-
firmed by gas chromatography that the medium provided the cells
with linoleic acid (18:2n-6) as the main PUFA (50.3 mol % per total
FAs). All the cells were maintained and grown at 37°C in a humidi-
fied atmosphere containing 5% CO2 unless stated otherwise. Myco-
plasma contamination was routinely checked twice a month using
the mycoplasma detection kit (11-1050, Minerva Labs).
Commercial cell lines
The human embryonic kidney cells (293FT, ATCC) were maintained
from passages 10–25 in DMEM containing 4.5 g/l glucose, 10%
FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 lg/ml strepto-
mycin. Human glioma cell line U87MG and murine brain microves-
sel endothelial cells bEND3 (ATCC) were maintained for not more
than 10 and 15 passages, respectively, in DMEM containing 1 g/l
glucose, and with the same supplements described above. The
generation of stable human U87MG cell lines overexpressing green
fluorescent protein (GFP) or MDGI as GFP-fusion (MDGI-GFP) has
been previously described (5). The immortalized human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HuAR2T) were obtained from the Ojala Lab
(University of Helsinki, Finland) and maintained from passages 15–
25 in Endothelial Basal Medium 2 (C-22211) added with Supple-
ments Pack Endothelial Cell GM2 (C-39211; Promocell) and 2 lg/ml
doxycycline.
Lentivirus production and generation of MDGI-silenced cells
The MDGI/FABP3 shRNA-constructs in the pLKO.1 vector were
obtained from the RNAi Consortium shRNA library (Broad Institute
of MIT and Harvard). The sequences were as follows: shMDGI1:
50GACCAAGCCTACCACAATCAT30, shMDGI2: 50GACAGGAAGGTCA
AGTCCATT30.
Second-generation lentiviruses were produced by co-transfecting
the MDGI shRNA or Scr-containing plasmids and lentiviral packag-
ing
plasmids
CMVg
and
CMVD8.9
(Addgene)
together
with
Fugene6-transfection reagent (Promega) into 293FT cells. After
72 h, the virus-containing supernatants were collected and filtrated.
On the day of transduction, human glioma cell spheres were
dissociated with Accutase (Gibco) and transduced with viral super-
natants together with 8 lg/ml Hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma). On
the next day, the cells were supplied with the fresh complete
medium. MDGI silencing was verified using Western blot and real-
time qRT–PCR.
Immunofluorescence
In order to attach the suspension cells, glass coverslips were first
coated with Poly-D-Lysin (Sigma) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were cultured for 24 h after which they were
fixed with 4% PFA and permeabilized with 0.5% NP-40 in PBS. The
cells were blocked with 3% BSA-PBS and incubated with the
primary and fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies (Alexa
Fluor, Life technologies). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (Vec-
tashield, Vector Laboratories).
Western blot
The cells were lysed either in RIPA-buffer [150 mM sodium chlo-
ride, 50 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1%
sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS, 0.5 mM DTT, Complete ultratablet
protease inhibitor, (Roche)] or in SDS-buffer (150 mM Tris, pH 6.8,
1.2% SDS, 30% glycerol, 15% b-mercaptoethanol). Protein concen-
trations of the extracts were determined spectrophotometrically
(Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Scientific). 10–20 lg of
protein was loaded to a 12% SDS–PAGE gel followed by a transfer
to PVDF membrane (Immobilon, Millipore) either by electroblotting
in transfer buffer (20% MetOH, 250 mM Tris, 1.9 M glycine) 100 V
for 1 h at 4°C or by Transblot Turbo device (Bio-Rad) using manu-
facturer’s instructions. After blocking (5% BSA in 0.1% TBS-
Tween), the membrane was probed with the primary antibodies o/n
at 4°C. After several washes, the membrane was probed with horse-
radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed again
and finally visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico kit (Thermo
Scientific) or with Clarity Western ECL (Bio-Rad).
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA extraction was performed using the Nucleospin RNA II kit
(Macherey-Nagel) and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA
(cDNA) with High-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit and
MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). Quantita-
tive real-time PCR (qRT–PCR) was performed using SYBR Green
PCR Mix (Kapa Biosystems). Relative gene expression was normal-
ized to ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) housekeeping gene. Rela-
tive quantification of the expression levels between the samples was
performed according to the Delta Ct method (DCt). Primer sequences
in 50-30-direction were as follows: MDGI (fwd): CCTGGAAGCTA
GTGGACAGC; MDGI (rev): TAGCAAAACCCACACCGAGT; EGFR
(fwd): TCCAGTGGCGGGACATAGT; EGFR (rev): TGGATCACACT
TTTGGCAGC; ARF1 (fwd): TCCCACACAGTGAAGCTGATG; ARF1
(rev): GACCACGATCCTCTACAAGC.

 Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium
Bromide
(MTT;
5 mg/ml in PBS) was added and the cells were incubated for 2 h.
Finally, the cells were lysed (10% SDS, 10 mM HCl) o/n and the
absorbance was measured at 540 nm using Multiskan Ascent soft-
ware version 2.6 (Thermo Labsystems).
Cell viability and apoptosis
Trypan blue exclusion method was used to estimate the cytotoxic
effects of MDGI silencing. Cells were diluted 1:2 in 0.4% Trypan
blue solution (Sigma), after which viable and dead cells were
counted. The percentage of viable cells was determined as follows:
(number of viable cells/total cell number) × 100. The proportions
of apoptotic cells were determined with Annexin V staining which
binds to phosphatidylserine residues translocated to the outer cell
membrane during early stages of apoptosis. Cells were dissociated
with Accutase and stained with Annexin V conjugate (Annexin V
Alexa Fluor 488, Molecular Probes), for 15 min in RT. After washes
with binding buffer (10 mM HEPES—140 mM sodium chloride—
2.5 mM CaCl2), the lentiviral transduced cells were fixed with 4%
PFA (containing 2.5 mM CaCl2) for 10 min at 4°C, suspended into
binding buffer and analysed with flow cytometer (BD Accuri C6)
equipped with appropriate lasers. Cell gating and data analysis was
performed using FlowJo v10.1 software (Tree Star Inc.).
Apoptosis arrays
Expression of apoptosis-associated proteins was determined using
the Human apoptosis antibody array (ab134001, Abcam) containing
antibodies against 43 proteins in duplicates and additional reference
spots. Membranes were incubated with 335 lg of cell extracts,
immunoblotted and exposed to X-ray films (Super RX, Fuji Medical)
according to manufacturers’ instructions. Pixel densities of each
protein spot were determined by using the ImageJ software.
EGFR inhibition
Glioma cells (5 × 103) were plated on 96-well plates in triplicates
and treated with various concentrations (0.1–10 lM) of gefitinib
(InvivoGen, USA). After 48 h MTT was added, cells were lysed and
the absorbance was measured as described above. Half-maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined for each cell line
using the following formula: IC50 = (50%–Low Inh%)/(High Inh%–
Low Inh%) × (High Conc–Low Conc) + Low Conc, where: Low
Inh%/High Inh% = % inhibition directly below/above 50% inhibi-
tion; Low Conc/High Conc = Corresponding concentrations of the
test compound.
Colony forming cell assay in methylcellulose
Methylcellulose stock solution (3%) and protocol were obtained
from the R&D Systems. Briefly, 1 × 104 cells were suspended as
single cells in complete medium containing the growth factors EGF
and FGF-b and semi-solid matrix Methylcellulose stock solution
(final concentration 1.3%). One millilitre of the final cell mixture
was added into 35-mm plate in triplicates and incubated for 3 weeks
at 37°C containing 5% CO2. The colonies were imaged using Nikon
Eclipse
Ti-E
inverted
microscope
and
quantified
using
the
CellProfiler cell image analysis software (http://cellprofiler.org/ci
tations/). The experiment was repeated three times.
Anchorage-independent growth assay
Cells (3,000/35-mm well, triplicates) were suspended in medium
containing 0.35% agarose and pipetted into 6-well plates containing
a 2-ml layer of solidified 0.7% agar in the medium. Complete
medium was added twice a week. After 14 (U87MG) or 27 (BT12
and BT13) days, eight images per well were taken (Zeiss Axiovert)
and the number of colonies was quantified using the ImageJ soft-
ware (National Institute of Health, USA). The experiment was
repeated twice.
Hypoxia and serum starvation
For the hypoxia treatment, 3 × 105 cells were plated on 35-mm dishes
1 day before the experiments. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a
hypoxia chamber (Ruskinn Technology Limited, UK) in 1% of O2 and
5% of CO2 for 24 h. For the FBS treatments, 3 × 105 cells were plated
on 35-mm dishes and grown for 7 days in DMEM containing 10%
FBS or in serum-free DMEM/F12. Afterwards, the cells were washed
with ice-cold PBS, lysed and analysed with Western blot.
Ex vivo brain slice cultures
Female FVB mice (5–8 weeks of age) were anesthetized, and their
brains were removed. Cerebellum was excised, and the two hemi-
spheres were embedded into 4% Low Melting Point Agarose
(Thermo Scientific) in PBS. Slices of 500 lm were cut with a vibra-
tome (HistoLab) and placed on top of 0.4-lm filter membranes (Mil-
lipore) in 6-well plates. Neurobasal A (1 ml, Gibco) supplemented
with 1 mM glutamine, 2% B-27 (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/strepto-
mycin was added to the bottom of each well. The medium was
changed every other day. The slices were incubated for 1 week
(37°C, 5% CO2) before starting the experiments (Ohnishi et al,
1998). The spheres were formed o/n in U-shaped 96-well plates
coated with 0.6% agarose (4,000 cells/well), after which they were
placed to the brain slices. The GFP-fluorescent spheres were imaged
at indicated time points by taking 10-lm optical slices with Leica
TCS SP2 confocal microscope. Image stacks were generated using
the ImageJ software, and the number of invaded and migrated cells/
cell groups was quantified manually. The experiment was repeated
twice with 3–5 individual spheres/cell line/slice in each experiment.
Analysis of lysosomal membrane permeabilization
LMP was determined using the LGALS1 puncta-staining assay (Aits
et al, 2015). BT12 cells treated with 2 mM L-leucine O-methyl ester
(LLOMe, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as positive controls
for LMP. For the quantification of LGALS1 staining (cytoplasmic/
puncta), DAPI- and LGALS1-stained cells grown on PDL-coated
coverslips were scanned with 3DHISTECH Pannoramic P250 FLASH
II
using
Zeiss
Plan-Apochromat
objective
(20×/NA
0.8)
and
pico.Edge 4.2 CMOS camera. The number of LGALS1-stained cells
(cytoplasmic/puncta) and unstained dead cells was manually calcu-
lated from each coverslip (n = 6, 50 mm2 area) using Panoramic
viewer software (3DHISTECH).

 Cytoplasmic Cathepsin B activity measurement
Protocol was modified from Jaattela and Nylandsted (2015). Cells
(2 × 104) in 100 ll of complete medium and growth factors were
plated in poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well plates in quadruplicates and
incubated o/n. Cytosolic and total cell extracts were prepared by
incubating the cells in digitonin extraction buffer on ice for 15 min
on a rocking table. Used digitonin concentrations for cytosolic and
total cell extractions were 20 lg/ml and 200 lg/ml, respectively.
After transferring the extracts into a new 96-well plate, the cells
were lysed in SDS-lysis buffer and protein concentrations were
determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scien-
tific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To measure the
cathepsin B activity, 50 ll of cytosolic and total extracts was mixed
with 50 ll of reaction buffer containing cathepsin B substrate (Cal-
biochem) in a black 96-well plate. The plate was preincubated at
30°C for 5 min, and then, the kinetics of cathepsin B activity was
measured using FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader (BMG Labtech)
at 30°C for 20 min (Ex 380 nm; Em 460 nm; 45-s interval). To
calculate the cytosolic cathepsin B release, measured enzyme activi-
ties were first normalized to the corresponding protein concentra-
tion of the same well, and then, cytoplasmic activity was compared
to the total cellular activity. The experiments were started at day 3
post-lentiviral transduction and repeated three times.
Pan-cathepsin inhibition assay
For cathepsin inhibition assays, 5 × 103 cells in 100 ll of complete
medium and growth factors were plated in 96-well plates in tripli-
cates. Cells were treated with 0, 1 or 2 lM of pan-cathepsin inhi-
bitor K777 (AdipoGen Life sciences). At indicated time points, MTT
was added, cells were lysed, and the absorbance was measured as
described above. Fresh inhibitor was added to the cells every other
day during the experiments. The experiment was started at day 4
post-lentiviral transduction and repeated three times.
Lysosomal extracts
Lysosomal extracts were prepared at day 6 post-lentiviral transduc-
tion by density gradient ultracentrifugation using the Lysosome
Enrichment Kit for Tissue and Cultured Cells (Thermo Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. One readout constituted
of six independent spheroid culture samples pooled together.
Presence of the lysosomes and purity of the collected fractions
were verified using Western blot analysis with specific antibodies
against lysosomes (LAMP2) and endoplasmic reticulum (Calnexin 1).
Extracted lysosome pellets were stored at �80°C and further analysed
by mass spectrometry. The experiment was performed two times.
Mass spectrometric analysis of lysosomal lipids
Total lipids in the lysosomal fractions were extracted using the
Folch method (Folch et al, 1957). The lipids were identified and
quantified by direct infusion electrospray ionization-tandem mass
spectrometry as previously described (Tigistu-Sahle et al, 2017)
with Agilent 6490 Triple Quad LC/MS with iFunnel technology (Agi-
lent Technologies, Inc.). In brief, the lipid extracts in chloroform:
methanol (1:2, v:v) were spiked with 10 internal standards and
supplemented with 1% NH4OH just prior infusion into the MS at a
flow rate of 10 ll/min. The lipids were detected by using lipid-class
specific detection modes (e.g. precursor ion m/z 264 for ceramide,
m/z 184 for PC and neutral loss scan of 141 amu for PE; Brugger
et al, 1997). The spectra were processed by MassHunter Worksta-
tion qualitative analysis software (Agilent Technologies, Inc.), and
the individual lipid species were quantified using the internal stan-
dards and free software called Lipid Mass Spectrum Analysis (Haimi
et al, 2006). The results are described as mol % of each molecular
species in its lipid class and marked as the number of acyl carbons:
number of double bonds (e.g. 36:2).
Clemastine treatment
Clemastine fumarate salt (Sigma) cytotoxicity was tested at the indi-
cated concentrations and time points using the MTT protocol as
described above. LMP induction by clemastine was verified using the
LGALS1 puncta-staining assay described in the previous section (Aits
et al, 2015). Cells were treated with DMSO or clemastine (1 lg/ml) at
37°C o/n and then lysed in RIPA-buffer for Western blot analyses.
Animal experiments
Animal experiments were approved by the Committee for Animal
Experiments of the District of Southern Finland (ESAVI/6285/
04.10.07/2014). Six-week-old immunocompromised NMRI-nu (Rj:
NMRI-Foxn1nu/Foxn1nu, Janvier Labs) mice were intracranially
engrafted using a stereotaxic injector (World Precision Instru-
ments) in the corpus callosum with 105 U87MG-GFP (n = 5) or
U87MG-GFP-MDGI (n = 9) or LN229-GFP (n = 10) or LN229-GFP-
MDGI (n = 10) cells in 5 ll of PBS under ketamine and xylazine
anaesthesia.
Post-operative
painkiller
(temgesic)
was
locally
administered for 2 days. Following the same methodology, the
clemastine preclinical study included the implantation of 105 cells
dissociated from spheroids in 5 ll of PBS. The cohorts were
distributed as BT12 parental (wt, Ve n = 9, Cle n = 12), shMDGI
infected (Ve n = 5, Cle n = 5), control shRNA infected (Ve
n = 5, Cle n = 5), ZH305 (Ve n = 10, Cle n = 10) and BT13 (Ve
n = 10,
Cle
n = 9).
Two
weeks
after
tumour
implantation,
animals
were
randomized
and
clemastine
(200 ll
in
PBS,
intraperitoneally) was injected daily at the indicated doses for a
duration of 12 days in one cohort or until the physical manifesta-
tion of tumour burden for the survival studies. Control animals
were treated under the same modalities with the vehicle (200 ll).
At the endpoint of the experiment, animals were euthanized and
brains were snap-frozen in �50°C isopentane (Honeywell) until
tissue processing.
Animal tissue processing and analysis
Snap-frozen xenografted brains were cut using a cryotome (Cryostar
NX70, Thermo Scientific) into series of 9-lm-thick coronal sections
collected from the frontal to the anteroposterior part of the tumour.
Tissue sections were fixed in 4% PFA, blocked with 5% FBS and
0.03% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and stained for the human vimentin or
CD31 and MDGI by immunofluorescence. Whole-brain sections
were then scanned using a slide scanner (3DHistec). When required,
verification of co-located staining was performed on 9-lm distant

 consecutive sections of each brain. Primary tumour volume determi-
nation was obtained by measuring the tumour area of 100-lm
distant consecutive sections covering the whole tumour (up to 30
histologic sections). Quantification of the different tumour parame-
ters (tumour cell invasion, number of angiotropic satellites) was
performed on 10 sections equally distributed along the entire
tumour.
Microscope imaging
The samples were imaged with a fluorescent upright microscope
(Zeiss Axioplan and Axioimager) using AxioVision software. For the
light microscopy, the cells were visualized and imaged with an
inverted epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200) equipped
with AxioVision software. Confocal images were taken with Zeiss
LSM 780 and 880 equipped with appropriate lasers.
Patient study approval
The ethics committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusi-
maa approved this study. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health,
Finland, permitted the use of tumour tissue. The ethics committee
of the Pohjois-Savo Health Care District municipalities permitted the
use
of
human
glioma
tissue
specimens
(53/2009,
1.8.2009-
31.7.2019).
Statistics
Association of MDGI expression with other factors was tested using
a Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test and Mann–Whitney’s U-test
was used for the MDGI vs. age analysis. All tests were 2-tailed. The
cumulative survival rates of patients were estimated by using the
Kaplan–Meier method, and survival between groups, hazard ratio
(HR) and their 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were computed by
using the Cox proportional hazards model. Overall survival was
calculated from the date of the surgery of primary tumour to death,
censoring patients still alive on the last date of follow-up. Glioma-
specific survival was calculated from the date of the surgery of
primary tumour to glioma caused death, censoring patients still
alive or lost from follow-up for other cause on the last date of
follow-up. Analyses were conducted with the IBM SPSS 22 software.
Results from all other experiments were analysed using the
GraphPad Prism 7 software (La Jolla, USA) using two-tailed,
nonparametric Mann–Whitney’s U-test. All the experiments were
repeated at least three times with triplicates unless stated otherwise.
For the lipidomics, two cell lines were used and the experiment was
repeated
two
times.

The paper explained
Problem
Glia-derived brain tumours are the most frequent primary central
nervous system cancers. In particular, its deadliest and the most
frequent form, glioblastoma, is highly invasive cancer. Glioblastoma
cells cannot be completely removed by surgery, and they exhibit high
resistance to therapies. Finding a potential weakness of these invasive
glioblastomas is required to improve the otherwise very poor patient
prognosis. Current drugs suffer from poor specificity, which increases
the off-target and side effects, and even poorer brain delivery due to
the presence of a highly selective blood–brain-barrier (BBB). This study
investigated a novel modality of the glioblastoma cell death, the lyso-
somal membrane permeabilization (LMP). It identifies the heart-type
fatty acid binding protein (MDGI/FABP3) as a central regulator of the
lysosomal membrane integrity in glioblastoma cells. The LMP can also
be induced in vivo by administering drugs that can pass through the
BBB, such as the cationic amphiphilic (CAD) antihistamine clemastine.
Results
Using patient databases, tissue samples and live glioblastoma cells
isolated from several patients, we show that MDGI is a biomarker of
tumour invasiveness. Moreover, silencing of MDGI provoked death of
glioblastoma
cells
through
activation
of
the
LMP.
Using
high-
throughput lipidomics analyses, we were able to pinpoint the accu-
mulation or depletion of very specific lysosomal phospholipids in the
absence of MDGI. We linked the lysosomal membrane destabilization
induced by the silencing of MDGI to interrupted transportation of
linoleic acid from the extracellular space to the intracellular compart-
ment. Among the family of lysosomotropic LMP-inducing agents, the
antihistamine clemastine was able to kill patient-derived glioblastoma
cells without compromising the viability of non-cancer cells. Ulti-
mately, the administration of clemastine to mice bearing patient-
derived tumours showed a very significant reduction of the invasive
cancer cell density. Depending on the patient-isolated cells, clemastine
treatment left only a very circumscribed tumour or completely eradi-
cated highly diffusive glioblastoma.
Impact
Bearing in mind, the chemo-resistant nature of infiltrating gliomas
and the poor delivery of conventional drugs due to the BBB, the
repurposing of antihistamines and other CADs to trigger the LMP in
invasive neoplasms should be considered as an adjuvant therapy to
the standard of care, i.e. the surgical resection of the primary tumour
and conventional radio- and chemotherapies.
