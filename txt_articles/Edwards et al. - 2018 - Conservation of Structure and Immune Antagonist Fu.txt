SUMMARY
Non-retroviral
integrated
RNA
viral
sequences
(NIRVs) potentially encoding �280 amino acid homo-
logs to filovirus VP35 proteins are present across the
Myotis genus of bats. These are estimated to have
been maintained for �18 million years, indicating
their co-option. To address the reasons for co-
option, 16 Myotis VP35s were characterized in com-
parison to VP35s from the extant filoviruses Ebola
virus and Marburg virus, in which VP35s play critical
roles in immune evasion and RNA synthesis. The
Myotis VP35s demonstrated a conserved suppres-
sion of innate immune signaling, albeit with reduced
potency, in either human or Myotis cells. Their atten-
uation reflects a lack of dsRNA binding that in the
filoviral VP35s correlates with potent suppression
of interferon responses. Despite divergent function,
evolution has preserved in Myotis the structure of
the filoviral VP35s, indicating that this structure is
critical for co-opted function, possibly as a regulator
of innate immune signaling.
INTRODUCTION
Non-retroviral integrated RNA viral sequences (NIRVs) are
thought to reflect rare events in which RNA viruses that do not
encode their own reverse transcriptase co-opt such an enzyme
present in the infected cell, leading to integration of viral se-
quences into the germline. NIRVs are present in fungi, plants, in-
sects, and mammals (Belyi et al., 2010; Crochu et al., 2004; Horie
et al., 2010; Tanne and Sela, 2005; Taylor and Bruenn, 2009;
Taylor et al., 2010, 2011). They serve as a viral fossil record,
providing evidence of historical viral interactions with a host
and allowing for the study of the timescale and evolution of the
virus-host interaction. Beyond this, however, the biological
significance of these genetic elements remains incompletely
understood.
Filoviruses, which include the highly pathogenic Ebola virus
(EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are negative sense, single-
stranded RNA viruses with cytoplasmic replication that are
highly represented among mammalian NIRVs (Belyi et al.,
2010; Taylor et al., 2010, 2011). Filovirus-like sequences corre-
sponding to the nucleoprotein (NP); large (L) protein, which is
the viral RNA polymerase; and viral protein of 35 kDa (VP35)
have been identified in several mammals (Belyi et al., 2010; Tay-
lor et al., 2010, 2011). These include both NP and L sequences in
the opossum, NP sequences in shrews and tenrecs, VP35 se-
quences in the tammar wallaby and Philippine tarsier, and both
NP and VP35 sequences in rodents (such as the house mouse
and brown rat) and mouse-eared bats (Myotis) (Belyi et al.,
2010; Taylor et al., 2010, 2011). Maintenance of sequences
recognizable as being of viral origin implies functional co-option.
However, although NIRVs are common in eukaryotic genomes,
recognizable candidates with an understood functional role are
exceedingly rare.
Myotis VP35 elements, likely the result of a long interspersed
nuclear element (LINE-1)-mediated insertion, retain an intact
open
reading
frame
(ORF)
potentially
encoding
proteins
of �280 amino acids (Belyi et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2010,
2011). This is in contrast to many other NIRVs, including the
NP sequences integrated into Myotis, which consist of disrupted
ORFs. Prior studies identified syntenic VP35-like ORFs in mem-
bers of Old World, North American, and South American clades

 of Myotis bats, suggesting a single integration event that
occurred an estimated 18 million years ago, before the diver-
gence of Old World and New World species (Ruedi et al., 2013;
Taylor et al., 2011). The long-term maintenance of an intact
ORF, coupled with the prior identification of multiple sites within
Myotis VP35 under positive selection, suggests the Myotis
VP35s have been preserved to carry out a function of signifi-
cance for the host (Taylor et al., 2011).
In the context of filovirus infection, VP35 proteins are innate im-
mune suppressors and part of the viral RNA synthesis machinery
(Basler et al., 2000; M€
uhlberger et al., 1999). Immune suppression
functions include inhibition of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling
to block type I interferon (IFN) production and suppress dendritic
cell maturation (Basler et al., 2000; Bosio et al., 2003; Jin et al.,
2010; Lubaki et al., 2016; Ramanan et al., 2012; Yen et al.,
2014; Yen and Basler, 2016). These inhibitory functions correlate
with VP35 capacity to bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
through its C-terminal IFN inhibitory domain (IID), which likely se-
questers viral dsRNA from RLR recognition (Bale et al., 2012,
2013; Ca
´ rdenas et al., 2006; Dilley et al., 2017; Leung et al.,
2010; Ramanan et al., 2012). Interaction of VP35 with PACT
also impairs RIG-I signaling (Luthra et al., 2013). In addition,
dsRNA binding-independent mechanisms of inhibition have
been described (Chang et al., 2009; Prins et al., 2009). Studies
on recombinant EBOV and MARV with mutated VP35s indicate
that these suppressive functions are critical for efficient virus
replication and for virulence in animals (Albarin
˜ o et al., 2015; Hart-
man et al., 2006, 2008; Prins et al., 2010b). Other VP35 functions
that may contribute to innate immune evasion include inhibition of
the IFN-induced antiviral protein kinase R (PKR) and counteract-
ing microRNA (miRNA) silencing (Fabozzi et al., 2011; Feng et al.,
2007; Haasnoot et al., 2007; Sch€
umann et al., 2009; Zhu et al.,
2012). For viral RNA synthesis, four viral proteins—NP, VP30, L,
and VP35—are required (M€
uhlberger et al., 1998, 1999). In the
viral RNA polymerase complex, VP35 is essential due to critical
interactions with the NP and L proteins (Becker et al., 1998; Leung
et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017; Mo
¨ ller et al., 2005; Prins et al., 2010a;
Theriault et al., 2004; Trunschke et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2017).
Here, we used the sequences of 16 Myotis VP35-like ORFs to
directly determine, by using functional, evolutionary, and struc-
tural approaches, how features of this non-retroviral RNA virus
have been maintained in the context of a multi-million-year co-
option by a mammalian host.
RESULTS
Myotis VP35s Are Less Potent Suppressors of IFN-b
Production than Extant Filoviral VP35s
We synthesized the originally identified Myotis VP35 ORF from
Myotis lucifigus (batVP35) and amplified and sequenced an addi-
tional 15 VP35 ORFs from a variety of Myotis species, including
another M. lucifigus VP35 (Figure S1) (Belyi et al., 2010). Analysis
by Partitionfinder revealed that two significant partitions existed
(of the three codon positions assayed), which were fit to the
F81+G and K3P+G models in IQ-TREE (Trifinopoulos et al.,
2016). These clades can be further divided into three groups
based on the presence or absence of previously described inde-
pendent deletions of 9 base pairs (bp) (blue), 39 bp (red), or no
deletion (black) (Figure 1A; Figure S1) (Taylor et al., 2011). Align-
ment required just these two deletions, indicating that the contri-
bution of alignment error to downstream bioinformatics analyses
such as ancestral sequence reconstruction and tests of selec-
tion is low with these data. Subsequently, the ancestral
Myotis VP35 sequence was reconstructed under a Jones-Tay-
lor-Thornton (JTT) + gamma model of amino acid substitution us-
ing PhyloBot, a pipeline that allows for the reconstruction of
extinct proteins (Hanson-Smith and Johnson, 2016).
Alignment of batVP35 to EBOV and MARV VP35s revealed
amino acid conservation particularly in the IID (Figure S2). To
determine whether Myotis VP35s can inhibit IFN-b production
via the RIG-I signaling pathway, reporter gene assays were em-
ployed. FLAG-tagged VP35s were expressed in HEK293T cells
as indicated, and Sendai virus (SeV), a known inducer of IFN-b
production via the RIG-I pathway, was used to induce IFN-b pro-
moter activity. Most Myotis VP35s, including the ancestral Myotis
VP35 (Ancestral), inhibited IFN-b production to a modest extent
(Figure 1A). Several Myotis VP35s had little to no inhibitory effect
at the concentration tested, including M. oxyotus, whereas others,
including M. davidii, exhibited increased inhibitory activity relative
to the others. The variation in activity did not correlate with either
the clade or the presence of base pair deletions (Figure 1A; Fig-
ure S1). To further assess potency, we selected several of the
most efficient Myotis VP35s, including representatives from
each sequence group (batVP35, M. nigricans, M. annectans,
and M. davidii) and assessed their activity across a range of con-
centrations in comparison to EBOV VP35 (eVP35) in HEK293T
cells (Figure 1B). As expected, eVP35 inhibited IFN-b promoter
activity over a range of concentrations. In contrast, the inhibitory
activity of all four Myotis VP35s was most efficient at the highest
concentration tested, but inhibition titrated out quickly (Figure 1B).
Filoviral VP35 inhibition of RLR signaling prevents the virus-
induced phosphorylation and activation of transcription factor
IRF-3 (Basler et al., 2003; Ramanan et al., 2012). Therefore,
IRF-3 phosphorylation was monitored in the absence or pres-
ence of either eVP35 or batVP35. eVP35 blocked SeV-induced
IRF-3 phosphorylation over a range of concentrations, while
batVP35 was effective only at the highest concentration (Fig-
ure 1C). Another control, MARV nucleoprotein (mNP), did not
inhibit IRF-3 phosphorylation. These data indicate that a repre-
sentative endogenous Myotis VP35 retains the ability to inhibit
RLR signaling and IFN-b production, although with decreased
efficiency relative to extant filovirus VP35s.
Myotis VP35 IFN-Antagonist Function in Bat Cells
By use of an IFN-b promoter reporter assay, we also assessed
IFN-inhibitory activity of FLAG-tagged eVP35, Ancestral VP35,
and the 16 Myotis VP35s in a transformed nasal epithelial (Nep)
cell line from a M. myotis bat (He et al., 2014). As seen in the
HEK293T cells, eVP35 potently inhibited activity of the IFN-b
promoter in M. myotis cells, whereas many Myotis VP35s ex-
hibited attenuated inhibitory activity (Figure 1D). The pattern of
Myotis VP35s that inhibit SeV-induced IFN-b reporter activity in
HEK293T cells does not perfectly align with inhibitory activity in
M. myotis cells (Figures 1A and 1D). For example, M. oxyotus
has no detectable inhibition of IFN-b promoter activity in
HEK293T cells but shows modest inhibition in the M. myotis
862
Cell Reports 24, 861–872, July 24, 2018
 cell line. However, several Myotis VP35 ORFs show similar,
attenuated, inhibitory activity in both human and Myotis cells,
including batVP35, M. nigricans, M. horsfieldii, and M. riparius
(Figure 1D). These data demonstrate that Myotis VP35s consis-
tently exhibit substantially decreased IFN-inhibitory activity rela-
tive to filoviral VP35s, but many have retained some capacity to
inhibit IFN-b production in both human (HEK293T) and Myotis
(Nep) cell lines. batVP35 demonstrated similar, modest, IFN-b
inhibitory activity in both cell lines, suggesting that batVP35
and HEK293T cells provide an appropriate model for further
analysis of VP35 functions retained by Myotis VP35s.
Myotis VP35s Lack dsRNA Binding Activity
Filoviral VP35s bind dsRNA via the IID, likely sequestering dsRNA
from RLRs (Bale et al., 2013; Ca
´ rdenas et al., 2006; Dilley et al.,
2017;Leunget al., 2010;Ramanan et al.,2012).dsRNA binding re-
quires amino acid residuesofthe central basic patch(CBP) (Leung
et al., 2010; Ramanan et al., 2012). In eVP35, the CBP is
composed of R305, K309, R312, K319, R322, and K339 (Leung
et al., 2010). Conserved between eVP35 and MARV VP35
(mVP35) are basic residues (using eVP35 numbering) at positions
R305, K309, R312, R322, and K339 (Figure S2; eVP35, asterisk;
mVP35, number sign). In batVP35, positions equivalent to
eVP35 residues 312, 319, 322, and 339 are basic, while the resi-
dues equivalent to 305 and 309 are not basic but instead are glu-
tamic acid and a glycine, respectively (Figure S2). Within the 17
Myotis VP35s, the eVP35 305 equivalent is non-basic (glutamic
acid [E] or glutamine [Q]) in the clade containing sequences with
a 9 bp deletion (Figure S1, blue) but is a basic residue (lysine [K])
in the ancestral Myotis VP35 sequence and those in the clade con-
taining sequences with either a 39 bp deletion (red) or no deletion
(black) (Figure S1). The glycine at 309 (using eVP35 numbering) is
conserved across all 16 Myotis VP35s and the ancestral recon-
structed sequence (Figure S1). To determine whether batVP35
has retained dsRNA binding activity, the IIDs of eVP35 and
batVP35 were expressed, purified, and used in an in vitro RNA
binding assay. As expected, eVP35 bound dsRNA; however,
no interaction between batVP35 and dsRNA was detected

were the most efficient inhibitors of IFN-b promoter activity for
each sequence group in HEK293T cells, and M. oxyotus, which
lacks inhibition of virus-induced IFN-b reporter activity in
HEK293T cells but maintains modest inhibition in the M. myotis
Nep cells, were expressed in HEK293T cells. Cell lysates contain-
ing each VP35 were subjected to a polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid
[poly(I:C)] pull-down (Figure 2B). As expected, eVP35 and mVP35
interacted with poly(I:C), while eVP35 R312A did not (Figure 2B).
Despite expression levels greater than that of the filovirus
VP35s, batVP35 again had no detectable interaction with dsRNA
(Figure 2B). Furthermore, M. oxyotus, M. davidii, M. annectans,
and M. nigricans did not bind the poly(I:C) beads (Figure 2B).
These results indicate that Myotis VP35s lack the dsRNA binding
activity characteristic of viral VP35s.

in
HEK293T cells (Figures 2C–2E). As pre-
viously reported, eVP35 modestly in-
hibited IFN-b production induced by
each
of
these
activators;
however,
batVP35 did not show comparable inhib-
itory activity, suggesting a mechanism of
inhibition upstream of the kinases and activated RIG-I (Figures
2C–2E). The cellular protein PACT facilitates RIG-I activation,
but eVP35 can inhibit this by binding PACT and preventing
its interaction with RIG-I (Iwamura et al., 2001; Kok et al.,
2011; Luthra et al., 2013). This binding and inhibition requires
the CBP residues but appears to be independent of VP35
dsRNA binding activity (Luthra et al., 2013). eVP35 was there-
fore compared to eVP35 R312A, mVP35, and batVP35 in an
IFN-b reporter gene assay to assess inhibition of PACT
enhancement of RIG-I signaling (Figure 2F). In the absence of
SeV, expression of RIG-I alone induced reporter activity, while
expression of PACT alone did not (Figure 2F). Co-expression of
PACT with RIG-I led to an enhancement of reporter activity
over that of RIG-I alone, and this enhancement was efficiently
inhibited by eVP35, as previously described (Figure 2F) (Luthra
et al., 2013). Similarly, mVP35 blocked the effect of PACT,
demonstrating that this inhibition is a conserved function of fi-
loviral VP35s. Although prior work identified eVP35 dsRNA
binding mutants that are unable to block PACT activation of
RIG-I, eVP35 R312A blocked PACT-enhanced RIG-I activity
at the highest concentration tested, demonstrating that VP35
dsRNA binding activity is not required for this relatively weak
864
Cell Reports 24, 861–872, July 24, 2018
 inhibition (Figure 2F). However, this effect titrates out quickly.
batVP35 inhibited PACT-mediated RIG-I activation more effi-
ciently than did eVP35 R312A, significantly inhibiting reporter
activity at both concentrations tested (Figure 2F). Infection
with SeV results in reporter activity that is enhanced in the
presence of RIG-I. PACT expression combined with SeV infec-
tion results in a minor increase in reporter activity over infected,
empty vector-transfected cells. However, co-expression of
PACT with RIG-I leads to a synergistic enhancement of re-
porter activity (Figure 2F). Both eVP35 and mVP35 potently in-
hibited reporter activity in the presence of SeV infection, while
eVP35 R312A showed a substantially reduced, albeit still sig-
nificant, inhibition of IFN-b reporter activity. Although not as
potent as the wild-type filovirus VP35s, batVP35 again signifi-
cantly inhibited reporter activity (Figure 2F). eVP35 carries
out its inhibitory effect at least partly through its interaction
with PACT; therefore, we asked whether batVP35 can bind
PACT. Similar to eVP35, mVP35 co-immunoprecipitated with
PACT, suggesting mVP35 uses a mechanism of PACT inhibi-
tion comparable to eVP35 (Figure S3). As previously shown,
eVP35 R312A did not detectably interact with PACT (Luthra
et al., 2013). Similarly, batVP35 did not pull down PACT,

Full-Length Myotis VP35 Is Required for Inhibition of
IFN-b Production
To map regions of Myotis VP35 important for inhibition of IFN-b
production, truncations that include the N or C termini of eVP35
(eN VP35 or eC VP35) or batVP35 (batN VP35 or batC VP35) and
chimeric constructs containing the N terminus of eVP35 and the
C terminus of batVP35 (eNbatC VP35) or the N terminus of
batVP35 and the C terminus of eVP35 (batNeC VP35) were con-
structed (Figure 3A). In the IFN-b promoter assay, eVP35
potently inhibited IFN-b promoter activity (Figure 3B). eN VP35
exhibited decreased inhibitory activity (Figure 3B). eC VP35 re-
tained potent inhibitory activity, demonstrating that the IID of
eVP35 can function independently of its N-terminal oligomeriza-
tion domain at the concentrations tested (Figure 3B). As ex-
pected, full-length batVP35 demonstrated modest inhibition of
IFN-b promoter activity. However, expression of neither batN
VP35 nor batC VP35 inhibited reporter activity, indicating
that full-length batVP35 is required for inhibition (Figure 3B).
The chimeric eNbatC VP35 and batNeC VP35 constructs
Cell Reports 24, 861–872, July 24, 2018

 recapitulated the inhibitory patterns seen for their respective
eVP35 component, preventing us from determining whether
the batVP35 termini contributed to the activity detected
(Figure 3B).
Restoration of Basic CBP in Myotis VP35 Does Not
Enhance Inhibition of IFN-b Production
Given the critical role of CBP residues in the potent IFN inhibitory
activity and dsRNA binding by eVP35 and mVP35, we generated
a batVP35 construct in which residues E246 and G250, position-
ally equivalent to eVP35 residues R305 and K309, were both
mutated to arginine (batVP35 RR) (Figure 3C). As before,
eVP35 potently inhibited IFN-b promoter activity while wild-
type batVP35 had a low level of inhibition (Figure 3D). Restora-
tion of the basic CBP in batVP35 RR had minimal effects on
inhibitory activities (Figure 3D). Furthermore, batVP35 RR did
not gain the ability to interact with dsRNA, as shown with a
poly(I:C) pull-down (Figure 3E). Therefore, despite the impor-
tance of these basic residues in filovirus VP35s, mutation of
these residues does not confer on batVP35 robust activity, sug-
gesting that other residues contribute to the attenuated inhibitory
activity of batVP35.
Myotis VP35 Does Not Inhibit PKR Activation or miRNA
Silencing
eVP35 inhibits PKR activation, and although inhibition does not
require dsRNA binding activity, loss of inhibition occurs with
mutation of at least two basic amino acids in the CBP (Feng
et al., 2007; Sch€
umann et al., 2009). FLAG-tagged eVP35,
eVP35 R312A, mVP35, and batVP35 were therefore assayed
for inhibition of PKR phosphorylation stimulated by SeV infec-
tion. Consistent with prior studies, eVP35 and eVP35 R312A
efficiently inhibited PKR phosphorylation (Figure 4A). mVP35
was similarly inhibitory, demonstrating that PKR inhibition is
conserved among filoviral VP35s. However, batVP35 was un-
able to detectably block the SeV-induced PKR phosphorylation
(Figure 4A). The same VP35 constructs were tested for inhibi-
tion of miRNA silencing using a reporter gene assay in which
a luciferase reporter containing miR30 target sequences was
co-transfected with plasmids expressing either the non-target-
ing miR21 or the targeting miR30 (Zhu et al., 2012). Whereas
miR21 fails to inhibit luciferase expression, the miR30 plasmid
does so. As expected, eVP35 and eVP35 R312A counteracted
miRNA silencing (Figure 4B). Although this function is also
conserved in mVP35, batVP35 does not block the miR30 inhi-
bition (Figure 4B).
Myotis VP35s Do Not Disrupt EBOV or MARV Replication
One potential function of endogenous Myotis VP35s would be to
interfere with the replication of an infecting filovirus. VP35 func-
tion in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) com-
plex is crucial for virus replication (Becker et al., 1998; Leung
et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017; Mo
¨ ller et al., 2005; M€
uhlberger
et al., 1998, 1999; Prins et al., 2010a; Trunschke et al., 2013;
Zhu et al., 2017). To determine the effect of batVP35 on replica-
tion activity, EBOV and MARV RNA synthesis was measured
through the use of a minigenome system. In these assays, the
RDRP complex, consisting of the NP, VP30, VP35, and L, is re-
constituted in mammalian cells by transfection (M€
uhlberger
et al., 1998, 1999). Co-transfection of a minigenome luciferase
reporter containing the necessary cis-acting sequence of the
EBOV or MARV genome allows for assessment of viral polymer-
ase activity. To determine the effect of Myotis VP35s on filovirus
replication, the EBOV or MARV RNA polymerase complexes
were expressed in HEK293T cells in the presence of increasing
concentrations of either the cognate VP35 or a subset of Myotis
VP35s (Figure 5). Although both EBOV and MARV replication
activity were sensitive to expression of excess cognate VP35,
neither minigenome system was inhibited by overexpression of
batVP35, M. nigricans, M. oxyotus, M. annectans, or M. davidii
VP35s, indicating that Myotis VP35s do not impair the activity
of these viral replication complexes (Figure 5). In addition, by
co-immunoprecipitation assay, batVP35 did not detectably
interact with EBOV NP, VP35, VP30, or a truncated form of
L (L 1-505) (data not shown). Altogether, this suggests that
Myotis VP35 does not interfere with the RNA synthesis of either
EBOV or MARV.
Consistent with these functional data, the N-terminal portions
of the Myotis VP35s show less homology to the filoviral VP35s
compared to the C-terminal IID (Figure S2). The N-terminal
domain of filoviral VP35s engages in protein-protein interac-
tions, including the interaction of an NP binding peptide

 (NPBP) that engages the viral NP and a motif in eVP35 that
binds the 8 kDa dynein light chain (LC8), each of which contrib-
utes to regulation of viral RNA synthesis (Kubota et al., 2009;
Leung et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017; Luthra et al., 2015; Zhu
et al., 2017). The Myotis VP35s lack sequences with obvious
homology to the previously described NPBP and LC8 interac-
tion motif (Figure S2). Loss of these features, particularly
the lack of the NPBP, is consistent with loss of RNA synthesis
functions.
Myotis VP35 Forms Homo-oligomers
The N terminus also has a VP35 homo-oligomerization domain
that is required for the maximal inhibition of IFN-b production
and for filoviral VP35 function as a polymerase co-factor (Mo
¨ ller
et al., 2005; Reid et al., 2005). A co-immunoprecipitation assay
demonstrated that FLAG-tagged batVP35 can co-precipitate
with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged batVP35, consistent with oligo-
merization (Figure 6A). Both eVP35 and mVP35 form tetramers,
as demonstrated by light scattering analyses, although work
has described the crystal structure of the N terminus of mVP35
forming a trimer instead (Bruhn et al., 2017; Edwards et al.,
2016). To determine the oligomeric state of batVP35, we used
multi-angle light scattering coupled to size exclusion chromatog-
raphy and found that it also forms a tetramer (Figure 6B). There-
fore, the ability of Myotis VP35s to form homo-oligomers has
been retained.
Myotis VP35 C Terminus Shares Structural Homology to
Filovirus VP35s
The degree of sequence homology between Myotis and filoviral
VP35s is greatest in the C-terminal IID (sharing 35% and 27%
amino acid identity between batVP35 IID and IIDs of eVP35
and mVP35, respectively). The structure of the batVP35 IID, con-
taining residues 158–281, was pursued for comparison to previ-
ously reported filovirus VP35 IID structures. The X-ray crystal
structure of the batVP35 IID RR mutant was solved to 2.6 A
˚ using
molecular replacement with the wild-type eVP35 IID structure
(PDB: 3L25, molecule A) as the search model (Figure 6C; Table
S1). This demonstrated striking structural homology between
batVP35 and the common filoviral VP35 protein fold (Figure 6C;
batVP35, pink; eVP35, yellow). Therefore, despite limited
sequence similarity to eVP35 and mVP35, this protein fold is
independently conserved in batVP35 through evolution. A com-
parison of the surface electrostatic potentials of batVP35 and
eVP35 shows that there is less basic charge along the compara-
ble eVP35:RNA binding interface of batVP35 (Figures 6D and 6E,
left). Rotation of the structure to the opposite face of the RNA
binding interface reveals that batVP35 lacks much of the highly
charged first basic patch, a region important in VP35 polymerase
co-factor activity, consistent with the absence of conservation of
residues corresponding to eVP35 R222, R225, and K248 (Fig-
ures 6D and 6E, right; Figure S2) (Prins et al., 2010a).
Myotis VP35 Residues Undergoing Diversifying and
Purifying Selection Map to the IID
Analysis of the 16 Myotis VP35 sequences, excluding the ances-
tral reconstructed Myotis VP35, using MEME (mixed effect
model of evolution) identified three residues in the IID of Myotis
VP35 that underwent episodic diversifying selection (using
batVP35 numbering, residues 189, 209, and 223) (Figures S1
and S2, +; Table S2). That is, these sites appeared to undergo
significant episodic selection along branches leading to species
of Myotis, whereas the sites have remained fixed among known
genera of filoviruses (Figure S2). Those residues under diversi-
fying selection include batVP35 residue 189, which is never a
basic residue in the 16 Myotis VP35 sequences (Figure S1). In
eVP35 and mVP35, the corresponding residue is a member of
the first basic patch (Prins et al., 2010a). Further analysis identi-
fied nine residues under purifying selection in the Myotis VP35s
(using batVP35 numbering, residues 94, 103, 132, 134, 176,
178, 181, 210, and 273) (Figures S1 and S2, �; Tables S3 and

 S4). The three residues under diversifying selection and five of
the nine residues under purifying selection map to the batVP35
IID (batVP35 residues 176, 178, 181, 189, 209, 210, 223, and
273), with all present on the surface of the protein (Figure 6F;
diversifying, orange; purifying, cyan). These analyses indicate
that the prevalent evolutionary signal in Myotis VP35 is one of
purifying selection, but the detection of significant diversifying
selection at three sites may also indicate limited lineage-specific
adaptation since their integration.

(Taylor et al., 2011). Despite identifica-
tion in mammalian genomes of NIRVs
from RNA viruses, such as filoviruses
and bornaviruses, the extent to which
homology reflects conservation of struc-
ture and function is not known (Belyi
et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2010, 2011).
A bornavirus nucleoprotein-like integration into the genome
of the thirteen-lined ground squirrel can yield a protein capable
of being incorporated into extant bornavirus ribonucleoprotein
complexes and inhibit viral replication and infection (Fujino
et al., 2014). However, functional roles for most described
NIRVs have not yet been assessed.
Filovirus-related sequences are disproportionally represented
among known mammalian NIRVs (Belyi et al., 2010; Taylor
et al., 2010, 2011). Sequences related to the filovirus NP gene
have been identified in at least 13 mammalian genera, L in a single
genus, and VP35 in seven mammalian genera (Belyi et al., 2010;
Taylor et al., 2010, 2011). The presence of such viral-like se-
quences in Myotis bats is intriguing given that bats serve as res-
ervoirs for MARV and are a suspected reservoir for EBOV (Leroy
et al., 2005; Towner et al., 2009). Although Myotis bats have not
been specifically implicated as reservoirs for filoviruses, the pres-
ence of multiple filovirus-like elements indicates historic infec-
tions. Previous timescale analysis of the filovirus-like integrations
868
Cell Reports 24, 861–872, July 24, 2018
 indicated insertion of NP sequences earlier than 25 million years
ago and VP35-like ORFs approximately 18 million years ago
(Ruedi et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2011). Although the NP-like
ORFs are disrupted in the Myotis genome, Myotis VP35 ORFs
have undergone purifying selection and have been actively main-
tained throughout the Myotis genus. This active maintenance
suggests a functional role of the VP35-like ORF beyond that of
simply a fossil record of a past virus-host interaction. Our
increased genomic sampling (compared to prior efforts) bolsters
evidence for the maintenance of the ORF and identifies numerous
sites subject to pervasive purifying selection, many of which map
to the C-terminal IID. The picture that emerges from our study is
partial functional conservation of the IFN-suppressing activity of
Myotis VP35s relative to filoviral VP35s.
A central feature of extant filoviral VP35s is potent suppression
of RIG-I signaling and IFN production (Edwards et al., 2016; Fea-
gins and Basler, 2015; Leung et al., 2010; Ramanan et al., 2012).
The most intensively studied, eVP35, inhibits IFN responses
through several mechanisms (Basler et al., 2000; Leung et al.,
2010; Luthra et al., 2013; Prins et al., 2009, 2010b; Yen and Bas-
ler, 2016). One crucial mechanism is thought to be the interaction
of EBOV and mVP35 with dsRNA via their IID, sequestering
immunostimulatory dsRNA from recognition by RLRs (Dilley
et al., 2017). Of the 17 Myotis VP35 ORFs tested, many were
able to inhibit RIG-I signaling in either HEK293T or M. myotis
cells, although several lacked measurable inhibitory activity,
with the pattern of inhibition varying between the two cell lines.
For those that possess anti-IFN function, the degree of inhibition
is substantially less than for extant filovirus VP35s. This impaired
anti-IFN function correlates with a lack of dsRNA binding activity.
The lack of conservation of two CBP residues in Myotis VP35
might explain the lack of dsRNA binding. However, reconstitu-
tion of the CBP in the batVP35 RR construct did not restore
dsRNA binding or IFN-b inhibitory activity. The solved crystal
structure of batVP35, although it contains the reconstituted
CBP, is less basic than that of eVP35, potentially explaining
the lack of dsRNA interaction.
Filovirus VP35s also employ dsRNA-independent mechanisms
of IFN inhibition, including the inhibition of PACT enhancement of
RIG-I activity through the interaction of eVP35 and PACT (Luthra
et al., 2013). In addition to the previously described inhibition by
eVP35, we show that mVP35 interacts with PACT and inhibits
PACT activation of RIG-I, indicating a conserved filovirus VP35
anti-IFN function. eVP35 R312A retains modest inhibition of
PACT-induced RIG-I activity, despite a lack of interaction with
PACT. batVP35 likewise maintains the functional capacity to
inhibit PACT activation of RIG-I while lacking a detectable interac-
tion with PACT. Therefore, batVP35 appears to act upstream of
RIG-I activation, potentially via inhibition of PACT, to block RIG-I
signaling. Consistent with an inhibitory mechanism proximal
to RIG-I activation, batVP35 lacks inhibitory activity when the ki-
nases IKKε and TBK-1, which are upstream of IRF-3 phosphoryla-
tion but downstream of RIG-I, are overexpressed. This is in
contrast to what is seen with EBOV or mVP35s in the same assay
(Edwards et al., 2016; Prins et al., 2009; Ramanan et al., 2012).
A study evaluated a single Myotis VP35 ORF from M. lucifigus
and concluded that the single bat-derived VP35 significantly in-
hibited human IFN-b promoter activity in HEK293T cells and that
inhibition was comparable to that of eVP35 (Kondoh et al., 2017).
However, prior studies have demonstrated that filovirus VP35s
are relatively weak inhibitors of IFN responses when these are ar-
tificially induced by overexpression of signaling molecules
downstream of RIG-I. In contrast, the same filovirus VP35s are
potent inhibitors when the pathway is activated by canonical
mechanisms (Edward et al., 2016; Ramanan et al., 2012). There-
fore, under conditions in which downstream activators are over-
expressed, the inhibitory activity of the Myotis VP35 may appear
to be similar to that of eVP35, allowing for the erroneous conclu-
sion that the IFN inhibitory functions of Myotis and eVP35s
are comparable. In our study, we used SeV infection, a nega-
tive-sense RNA virus, to trigger an IFN response through the
activation of RIG-I by its canonical mechanism. Under these
conditions, one can see potent inhibition by filovirus VP35s
and can more accurately assess the corresponding but lesser
activity of Myotis VP35s.
Filovirus VP35s also engage in innate immune evasion tactics
outside of suppressing IFN production. In contrast to filovirus
VP35s, batVP35 does not inhibit PKR phosphorylation. In
eVP35, it has been shown that although dsRNA binding is not
required, mutation of at least two CBP residues results in a loss
of inhibitory activity (Sch€
umann et al., 2009). Therefore, the
absence of inhibition of PKR phosphorylation by batVP35 could
be due to the presence of non-basic residues in two positions
in the CBP, at 305 and 309 (using eVP35 numbering). The lack
of inhibition of miRNA gene silencing by batVP35 might also be
attributable to the loss of PKR inhibition, because it has previously
been suggested that eVP35 R312A counteracts miRNA silencing
through its antagonism of PKR activity (Zhu et al., 2012).
The capacity of Myotis VP35 to form homo-oligomers and the
substantial conservation of the C-terminal filovirus VP35 protein
fold indicate purifying selection of structural elements over the
evolutionary timescale. This is consistent with the hypothesis
that host-virus protein-based interactions may have occurred
for a substantial time following endogenization, resulting in the
active maintenance of the filovirus-like VP35. The differential ca-
pacity to suppress IFN signaling by Myotis VP35s relative to
extant filovirus VP35s may be attributable to the divergence of
extant filovirus VP35s from the Myotis VP35s or to the diver-
gence of extant Myotis VP35s from the ancestral bat filovirus.
However, assessment of the inhibitory activity of the recon-
structed, ancestral Myotis VP35 sequence suggests that the
current endogenous Myotis VP35s have not evolved toward
more modest IFN inhibition; instead, they have maintained for
more than 18 million years the reduced, but significant, suppres-
sion of IFN induction present in the ancestral integration.
Although inhibition of EBOV or MARV RNA synthesis yielded
negative data, it remains possible that Myotis VP35s could inter-
fere with the replication of other extant viruses, including viruses
that have not yet been isolated, or with the replication of ances-
tral filoviruses that no longer exist. It is also plausible that there
was functional divergence among the differing integrated filovi-
rus-like bat genes with the now-pseudogenized Myotis NP pos-
sessing an antifiloviral function while the VP35 maintained an
immunoregulatory function. It seems probable that a potent sup-
pressor of IFN responses would be selected against, because
this could result in high susceptibility to viral infection. One can
Cell Reports 24, 861–872, July 24, 2018
869
 conceive of a scenario whereby modest inhibitory activity mod-
ulates IFN and inflammatory responses, which might otherwise
be detrimental to the virus-infected host; many negative regula-
tors of IFN and inflammatory pathways have been described
(Hayden and Ghosh, 2012; Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014). It is
possible that a viral protein might be co-opted for such a pur-
pose. Alternatively, it is possible that the Myotis VP35 was pre-
served to carry out an as-yet-unidentified function.
Despite evidence for functional maintenance, when and where
filovirus-like VP35 ORFs are expressed in Myotis bats is not
known. Limited analysis has yet to detect protein or mRNA
expression of the Myotis VP35s (Taylor et al., 2010, 2011). Using
qRT-PCR, we were unable to detect M. myotis VP35 mRNA in
transformed cell lines of the nasal epithelium, nervus olfactorius,
or brain of M. myotis (data not shown) (He et al., 2014). We further
looked for VP35 mRNA expression in the spleen of M. lucifigus
and only detected a signal for the filovirus-like VP35 slightly
above background (minus reverse transcriptase) levels (data
not shown). However, the lack of convincing detection of Myotis
VP35 mRNA in the cell lines and tissues examined does not pre-
clude the potential for Myotis VP35 expression. The human pro-
tein syncytin, co-opted from an endogenous retroviral gene
insertion and required for placental function, has tissue-specific
expression, with robust presence in the human placenta, weaker
expression in testis, and no detection in 21 other human tissues
(Mi et al., 2000). To gain further insight into possible Myotis VP35
functions, a more exhaustive search for tissue-specific and
developmentally regulated expression would be appropriate.

(FMNH_167239), Myotis horsfieldii (FMNH_177466), Myotis blythii (FMNH_140372), Myotis oxyotus (FMNH_174938), Myotis nigri-
cans (FMNH_162544), Myotis annectans (American Museum of Natural History, Ambrose Monell Cryo Collection (AMCC_110817),
Myotis riparius (AMCC_109656), Myotis albescens (AMCC_109603), Myotis septentrionalis (New York State Rabies Laboratory),
Myotis capaccinii and Myotis myotis (Dr. Jordi Serra-Cobo, Barcelona University, Spain) and were used to obtain the endogenous
filovirus-like VP35 open reading frames (ORFs) using the forward primer 50GCGCGCGGCCGCATCCCTGGAG30 and reverse primer
50GCGCAGATCTTCAAATCTTTAAC30. cDNA generated from a Myotis velifer incautus cell line (ATCC CRL-6012) was used to obtain
the filovirus-like VP35 ORF using the forward primer 50GCGCGCGGCCGCAATGTCCCTGGAGCAGTG C30 and reverse primer
50GCGCAGATCTTTAAATCTTTAACCCGAGGC30. The resulting PCR products were cloned with N-terminal Flag-tags into pCAGGS
and the sequences of the inserts were confirmed. Sequences were synthesized for Myotis davidii VP35 (GenBank: ALWT01033109.1,
nucleotides 1842-2562) and Myotis brandtii VP35 (GenBank: ANKR01158691.1, nucleotides 2885-3727) and were similarly tagged
and cloned (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ). Ancestral Myotis VP35 sequence reconstruction was carried out in Phylobot using the
related VP35-like sequence from the tarsier as an outgroup and PROTGAMMAJTT as the substitution model (Hanson-Smith and
Johnson, 2016). Phylobot uses the CODEML package of PAML to carry out empirical Bayesian ancestral sequence reconstruction.
The resulting sequence was synthesized and cloned as above (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ). pCMV-miR30, pCMV-miR21 and pCMV-
luc-miR30(P) were obtained from Addgene (Addgene plasmid #20670, #20381 and #20875) (Zeng and Cullen, 2003). Expression vec-

and pM1 MARV minigenome reporter (mMG) plasmid have previously been described (Ca
´ rdenas et al., 2006; Edwards et al., 2014,
2015, 2016; Luthra et al., 2013; Ramanan et al., 2012). MARV NP, MARV VP30 and MARV L were subcloned from Flag-tagged
pCAGGS into untagged pCAGGS (Edwards et al., 2014). Overlapping PCR was used to clone eVP35 R312A, batVP35 RR and
chimeric VP35s, which were cloned with N-terminal Flag-tags into pCAGGS. Bacterial Expression: eVP35 215-240, full length
batVP35 and batVP35 159-284 were subcloned into a modified pET15b vector (Novagen, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA).
Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification
Proteins were expressed as maltose binding protein (MBP) fusions in BL21(DE3) E. coli (Novagen, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) in LB
medium. Cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer containing 25 mM sodium phosphate [pH 7.5], 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM imid-
azole and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and were lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). Lysates were
clarified by centrifugation at 42,000 x g at 10�C for 40 minutes. Proteins were purified using a series of chromatographic columns and
sample purity was determined by SDS-PAGE.
Co-immunoprecipitation Assays
HEK293T cells (1 x106) were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) and at
24 hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 280 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mM
EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor (cOmplete; Roche, Indianapolis, IN)). Anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were incubated with lysates for one hour at 4�C, washed five times in NP-40 lysis buffer, and eluted using
3X FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 4�C for 30 minutes or by boiling for five minutes in 1x sample buffer. Whole
cell lysates and co-precipitation samples were analyzed by western blot.
Poly(I:C) Pull-down Assays
HEK293T cells (1 3 106) were transfected with 1 mg of the indicated VP35 plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific, MA). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 280 mM NaCl, 0.5% Non-
idet P-40, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor (cOmplete; Roche, Indianapolis, IN)). Lysates were incubated
with Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, PA) either coupled or uncoupled to low molecular weight poly(I:C) (Invivogen, CA) for four
hours at 4�C. Beads were washed five times in NP-40 lysis buffer and bound proteins were eluted by boiling for five minutes in 1x
sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by western blot.
IRF-3 Phosphorylation Assay
HEK293T cells (5 3 105) were transfected with 2, 1 or 0.5 mg of the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific, MA). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were infected with SeV. Eight hours post-infection, cells were lysed in NP-40
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 280 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor and
phosphatase inhibitor (cOmplete and PhosSTOP; Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Lysates were analyzed by western blot.
IFN-b Reporter Gene Assays
SeV-induced reporter assay: HEK293T cells (1 3 105) were transfected with an IFN-b firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, a constitu-
tively expressed Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pRL-tk) (Promega, Madison, WI) and the indicated VP35 expression plasmids
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). M. myotis Nep cells (2 3 105) were transfected in the same manner. At
e4
Cell Reports 24, 861–872.e1–e6, July 24, 2018
 twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were infected with SeV (Cantell Strain, HEK293T - 1000 HA Units, M. myotis
Nep – 100 HA Units) in DMEM, and 10% FBS. At eighteen hours post-treatment, cells were lysed and a dual luciferase reporter assay
(Promega, Madison, WI) was performed. Firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase values. The assay was per-
formed in triplicate; error bars indicated the standard error of the mean (SEM) for the triplicate. Kinase-induced reporter assay:
HEK293T cells (1 3 105) were transfected with an IFN-b firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, a constitutively expressed Renilla lucif-
erase reporter plasmid (pRL-tk) (Promega, Madison, WI), the indicated VP35 expression plasmids and the indicated activator; consti-
tutively active form of RIG-I (Flag RIG-I N), Flag IKKε or Flag TBK1. Twenty-four hours post-transfection the cells were lysed and as-
sayed using a dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and analyzed as above. PACT reporter assay: HEK293T cells
(1 3 105) were transfected with an IFN-b firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, a constitutively active Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid
(pRL-tk) (Promega, Madison, WI), expression plasmids encoding PACT (100 ng), RIG-I (1 ng) and indicated VP35 plasmids (500 and
5 ng) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were infected with SeV
(100 HA units). At eighteen hours post-infection, cells were lysed and a dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega, Madison, WI)
was performed and analyzed as above.
PKR Phosphorylation Assay
HEK293T cells (2.5 3 105) were transfected with Flag tagged eVP35, eVP35 R312A, mVP35 and batVP35 (500 ng). Twenty-four hours
post-transfection, cells were infected with SeV (1000 HA Units) as indicated after which virus was replaced with DMEM supple-
mented with 10% FBS. Eighteen hours post-infection, cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 280 mM NaCl,
0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor (cOmplete and
PhosStop; Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Lysates were analyzed by western blot.
microRNA Silencing Reporter Assay
The assay was modified from (Zhu et al., 2012): HEK293T cells (1 3 105) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, MA) with pCMV-luc-miR30(P) firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (30 ng) containing miR30 target sites, a constitutively active
Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (5 ng), pCMV-miR30 targeting plasmid (10 ng), pCMV-miR21 non-targeting plasmid (20 ng) and the
indicated pCAGGS VP35 plasmids (50 and 500 ng). Twenty-four hours post transfection the cells were lysed and assayed using a
dual luciferase reporter assay. Firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase values and the assay was done in
triplicate; error bars indicate the SEM for the triplicate.
Minigenome Assays
HEK293T cells (1 3 105) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) with expression plasmids encod-
ing either the EBOV or MARV replication complex components; NP, L, VP30, VP35, T7, T7 promoter-driven EBOV or MARV minige-
nome RNA (eMG or mMG), which encode a Renilla luciferase reporter gene, and a constitutively expressed firefly luciferase plasmid
(pCAGGS Firefly) that served as a transfection control. For the EBOV minigenome this consisted of 50 ng pCAGGS eNP, 100 ng
pCAGGS eL, 20 ng pCAGGS eVP30, 25 ng pCAGGS VP35, 40 ng eMG, 40 ng pCAGGS T7 and 0.2 ng pCAGGS Firefly. The
same concentrations of DNA were used for the MARV minigenome components, except for 25 ng of pCAGGS mVP30 was used.
Additional Flag-tagged VP35 expression plasmids were transfected in increasing concentrations as indicated (20, 100 and
200 ng). Forty-eight hours post transfection the cells were lysed and assayed using a dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega, Mad-
ison, WI). The assay was performed in triplicate; error bars indicate SEM for the triplicate.
SEC-MALS
SEC-MALS experiments were performed using a DAWN-HELEOS II detector (Wyatt Technologies) coupled to a Superdex SD200
column (GE Healthcare) in (10 mM HEPES [pH 7], 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM TCEP). 2 mg/ml sample was injected and raw data
were analyzed using ASTRA 6 software (Wyatt Technologies) to determine the weight averaged molecular mass (MW). Protein
concentrations were determined using the refractive index measured by an Optilab T-rEX (Wyatt Technologies) and a dn/dc =
0.185 mL 3 g�1.
RNA filter binding assay
Labeled RNAs (5 nM) were incubated with increasing concentrations of purified batVP35 IID protein. After 15 minutes at room tem-
perature, samples were applied to a dot blot apparatus (Whatman) with one nitrocellulose (NC) membrane on top of one nylon (NY)
membrane. Radiolabeled RNA bound to the NC and NY membranes were quantified using a Typhoon 9410 variable-mode imager,
and the fraction of RNA bound to batVP35 was calculated using the following equation: fraction bound = RNA signal on
NC/(RNA signal on NC + RNA signal on NY).
Antibodies
Monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M2, polyclonal rabbit anti-Flag, monoclonal mouse anti-HA, polyclonal rabbit anti-HA and monoclonal
mouse b-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Anti-IRF-3, anti-phospho IRF-3 (Ser396) and
Cell Reports 24, 861–872.e1–e6, July 24, 2018
e5
 anti-PKR were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Anti-phospho PKR antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge,
MA). Monoclonal anti-eVP35 antibody has previously been described (Prins et al., 2010b).
Western Blots
Lysates were run on 10% Bis-Tris Plus polyacrylamide gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) and transferred to PVDF membrane
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies and were developed using Western Lightning
Plus ECL (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).
Phylogenetic Analyses
Unaligned sequences were translated in Seaview and then aligned using Muscle (Gouy et al., 2010). Seaview was then used to
convert the alignment into a nucleotide-based codon alignment. Maximum likelihood analysis and model fitting was carried out using
IQ-TREE using the two significant partitions identified by Partitionfinder (Lanfear et al., 2012; Nguyen et al., 2015; Trifinopoulos et al.,
2016). Trees, midpoint rooting, and support values (ultrafast bootstrap and approximate likelihood ratio tests) were visualized using
Figtree 1.4.3 (Rambaut, 2012).
Analysis of Selective Pressure
Four tests for selection (MEME, FUBAR, FEL and SLAC) were carried out using Datamonkey, a web server for HyPhy (Delport et al.,
2010). We used a conservative approach to determine significance of pervasive selection which required a consensus of significant
codons from at least three methods (using default levels for posterior probabilities and significance) (Table S2, S3 and S4).
Crystallization, Diffraction Data Collection, Structure Determination and Refinement of Myotis VP35 IID
Initial conditions for crystallization of Myotis lucifigus residues 158-281 containing E246R and G250R mutations were identified using
commercially available screens (Anatrace). BatVP35 IID RR crystals grew in 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5 with 25% (w/v) PEG 3350. Diffrac-
tion data was collected at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (IMCA-CAT 17-ID beamline; Argonne, IL) at
100 K. Phases were determined using molecular replacement with the native wild-type structure of eVP35 IID (PDB: 3L25 molecule A)
and using MOLREP or PHASER (Read, 2001; Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997). The model was further refined using REFMAC interspaced
with manual building using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004; Murshudov et al., 1997). Validation of the structure was performed using
MOLPROBITY (Chen et al., 2010). Figures were prepared using PyMOL (Delano, 2002).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 with significance determined either by a one-way ANOVA followed by
Tukey’s test or by an unpaired t test. All statistical details can be found in the figure legends and data points were considered signif-
icantly different if the p value was < 0.05.
