ABSTRACT
Objective The majority of patients with chronic or
gestational hypertension do not develop pre-eclampsia.
Home
blood-pressure
monitoring
(HBPM)
has
the
potential to offer a more accurate and acceptable
means
of
monitoring
hypertensive
patients
during
pregnancy
compared
with
traditional
pathways
of
frequent outpatient monitoring. The aim of this study was
to determine whether HBPM reduces visits to antenatal
services and is safe in pregnancy.
Methods This was a case–control study of 166 hyper-
tensive
pregnant
women,
which
took
place
at
St
George’s Hospital, University of London. Inclusion crite-
ria were: chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension
or high risk of developing pre-eclampsia, no signifi-
cant proteinuria (≤ 1+ proteinuria on dipstick testing)
and normal biochemical and hematological markers.
Exclusion criteria were maternal age < 16 years, sys-
tolic blood pressure > 155 mmHg or diastolic blood
pressure > 100 mmHg,
significant
proteinuria
(≥ 2+
proteinuria on dipstick testing or protein/creatinine
ratio > 30 mg/mmol), evidence of small-for-gestational
age (estimated fetal weight < 10th centile), signs of severe
pre-eclampsia, significant mental health concerns or insuf-
ficient understanding of the English language. Pregnant
women in the HBPM group were taught how to measure
and record their blood pressure using a validated machine
at home and attended every 1–2 weeks for assessment
depending on clinical need. The control group was man-
aged as per the local protocol prior to the implementation
of HBPM. The two groups were compared with respect
to number of visits to antenatal services and outcome.
Results There were 108 women in the HBPM group
and 58 in the control group. There was no difference
in maternal age, parity, body mass index, ethnicity or
smoking status between the groups, but there were

more women with chronic hypertension in the HBPM
group compared with the control group (49.1% vs
25.9%, P = 0.004). The HBPM group had significantly
fewer outpatient attendances per patient (6.5 vs 8.0,
P = 0.003) and this difference persisted when taking into
account differences in duration of monitoring (0.8 vs 1.6
attendances per week, P < 0.001). There was no difference
in the incidence of adverse maternal, fetal or neonatal
outcome between the two groups.

INTRODUCTION
Hypertensive
disorders
of
pregnancy
include
gesta-
tional hypertension (GH), chronic hypertension and
pre-eclampsia (PE). They complicate up to 10% of preg-
nancies and are associated with adverse maternal and
fetal outcomes, such as eclampsia, stroke, renal and hep-
atic dysfunction, fetal growth restriction and stillbirth1–3.
Monitoring, early recognition and treatment are there-
fore key to reducing severe complications and mortality4.
Traditionally, women who develop hypertension in preg-
nancy are advised to attend an outpatient service or
day assessment unit (DAU) at their maternity hospital,
commonly two to three times a week, for blood pres-
sure monitoring and urine testing5. The purpose of these
assessments is to monitor for the development of PE
and/or placental insufficiency. However, the vast majority
(more than 80%) of these women do not develop PE6.
Frequent monitoring can be a source of anxiety for these
women and their families, is demanding for patients in
terms of time, transport costs and work absence, and has
significant service implications for healthcare providers.

These women may also undergo unnecessary medical
intervention, such as early delivery.
An alternative to this pathway is home blood-pressure
monitoring (HBPM), in which patients monitor and
record their own blood pressure using a validated
machine, with instructions from a healthcare professional
on the frequency of monitoring and when to attend
the hospital. HBPM is recommended in the general
population for diagnosing hypertension, but there is a
paucity of data on the use of HBPM in pregnancy7–9.
It has also been noted that 30% of pregnant women
monitor their own blood pressure without informing their
healthcare provider and using a wide range of devices, not
all of which have been validated in pregnancy10,11. This
highlights the need for evidence-based patient education
to establish and maintain safety of this practice. We
therefore developed a pathway for HBPM in pregnancy,
in which eligible women performed the majority of blood
pressure checks at home and recorded the results in their
notes or on a smartphone application. Our main aim was
to assess if HBPM can be used in women at risk of PE and
whether such monitoring reduces the number of visits to
antenatal services without causing any discernible adverse
outcome.
METHODS
Population and study design
This was a case–control study at St George’s Hospi-
tal, University of London, of a cohort of hypertensive
pregnant women enrolled on a HBPM pathway and
a control group managed according to the traditional
pathway of regular DAU visits for blood-pressure moni-
toring. Inclusion criteria were chronic hypertension, GH
or high risk of developing PE, no significant proteinuria
(≤ 1+ proteinuria on dipstick testing), and normal bio-
chemical and hematological markers. Pregnant women
in the HBPM group presented via referral either to the
hypertension clinic or to the DAU between December
2013 and November 2016. HBPM was implemented as
a quality improvement initiative at St George’s Hospi-
tal. The control group was derived retrospectively from
maternity databases and consisted of a historic cohort
of women who presented to the DAU with hyper-
tension in pregnancy and were managed as per the
local hospital protocol prior to the implementation of
HBPM. Search criteria included women referred to the
DAU for blood-pressure monitoring who did not have
a plan for delivery made within 1 week of their first
visit. Exclusion criteria were maternal age < 16 years,
systolic blood pressure > 155 mmHg or diastolic blood
pressure > 100 mmHg,
significant
proteinuria
(≥ 2+
proteinuria on dipstick testing or protein/creatinine
ratio > 30 mg/mmol), evidence of small-for-gestational
age (estimated fetal weight < 10th centile), signs of severe
PE (oliguria of < 500 mL urine output in 24 h, cerebral
or visual disturbance, pulmonary edema, epigastric or
right upper-quadrant pain, impaired liver function (twice
the upper limit of normal levels for aspartate transam-
inase and/or alanine transaminase), thrombocytopenia
(platelet count < 100 000/mm3)), significant mental health
concerns or insufficient understanding of the English lan-
guage.
Diagnoses of GH and PE were made according to
the criteria of the International Society for the Study
of Hypertension in Pregnancy12. GH was diagnosed
in the presence of systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg
and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg on at least
two occasions 4 h apart, developing after 20 weeks of
gestation in a previously normotensive woman, in the
absence of significant proteinuria. PE was diagnosed in
the presence of GH with proteinuria ≥ 300 mg in 24 h, or
two readings of ≥ 2+ on dipstick analysis of midstream
or catheter urine specimens if no 24-h collection was
available. PE superimposed on chronic hypertension was
diagnosed in the presence of significant proteinuria (as
defined above) after 20 weeks of gestation in women
with known chronic hypertension (history of hypertension
before conception or presence of hypertension at booking
visit before 20 weeks of gestation, in the absence of
trophoblastic disease). Diagnosis of chronic hypertension
was made when there was a documented presence of
chronic non-gestational hypertension prior to the current
pregnancy or history of antihypertensive medication prior
to 20 + 0 weeks’ gestation. White-coat hypertension was
diagnosed when there were confirmed high blood-pressure
recordings in the hospital/clinic with normal readings on
HBPM or ambulatory monitoring. Ethical approval was
obtained for the study (16/NW/0206).
Home blood-pressure monitoring pathway
Eligible patients were counseled and trained by a specialist
midwife and provided with an automated Microlife©
‘WatchBP Home’ blood-pressure machine (Microlife
Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan), which has been validated
for use in pregnancy and PE13. They were taught
how to measure their blood pressure accurately and
record readings in their notes or on a specially designed
smartphone app (Hampton Medical, Trakka Medical,
UK). Each patient was given a personalized schedule of
frequency of monitoring and timing of hospital visits
(to either DAU or antenatal clinic), depending on their
clinical need. While the schedule varied per patient, the
frequency of monitoring complied with National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on
hypertension in pregnancy5. A typical regime for a
woman with well-controlled chronic hypertension would
be to measure blood pressure two or three times a
week, whereas a woman initiating new treatment would
be asked to measure blood pressure twice a day and
would be reviewed 1 week later. The same specialist
midwife reviewed patients at interim visits and HBPM
recordings were reviewed. Blood pressure and urine were
assessed and ultrasound examination for fetal wellbeing
was performed as indicated. Patients were given written
instructions regarding when to present to hospital based

on their HBPM readings being out of normal range or
on their reporting symptoms of PE. Our protocol used
a systolic blood pressure of > 155 mmHg or a diastolic
blood pressure of > 100 mmHg as the trigger for a patient
to contact the hospital for review, to avoid patients
developing severe hypertension at home. This is in line
with NICE recommendations for hospital admission for
systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg or diastolic blood
pressure of 110 mmHg5. For those using the smartphone
app, a warning was generated automatically if they
inputted an abnormal reading. Any patient presenting
with such a concern was reviewed as per normal hospital
protocol.
Patients in the control group either presented directly
to the DAU or were referred from an antenatal clinic.
They were managed according to the hospital protocol
and had all blood-pressure checks performed in the DAU.
The hospital protocol at that time was based on NICE
guidelines for hypertension in pregnancy and follow-up
visits were once or twice a week, depending on severity of
hypertension5.
Data on maternal age, body mass index (BMI) at
booking, ethnicity, parity, smoking status, mode of
conception and pregnancy outcome were collected. The
diagnoses at the start of blood pressure monitoring and
at delivery were ascertained from medical records. We
also recorded the duration of blood pressure monitoring,
number of blood pressure-related visits to the DAU,
hypertension clinic and family practitioner, number
of ultrasound scans, hematological and biochemistry
tests on maternal blood, administration of steroids and
magnesium sulfate, and number of blood-pressure-related
hospital admissions or admission to the high-dependency
unit (HDU) for severe PE.
Adverse pregnancy outcome
Maternity,
ultrasound
and
neonatal
records
were
reviewed to collect data on adverse maternal, fetal
and neonatal outcomes. Adverse maternal outcome
included acute renal failure (maternal serum creatinine
level > 100 μmol/L antenatally or >130 μmol/L postna-
tally) or need for dialysis, acute myocardial ischemia,
need for third intravenous agent to control blood pres-
sure (i.e. in addition to labetalol and hydralazine),
hypertensive encephalopathy (altered mental status with
characteristic cerebral imaging), cortical blindness, reti-
nal detachment, stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), pul-
monary edema or adult respiratory distress syndrome
(defined by characteristic pulmonary imaging in addition
to oxygen requirement), need for mechanical ventilatory
support (other than for Cesarean section), disseminated
intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome, acute fatty liver,
liver hematoma or rupture, placental abruption, and
maternal death. Adverse fetal outcome included preterm
delivery (< 37 + 0 weeks’ gestation), small-for-gestational
age (birth weight < 10th centile), fetal growth restriction
(birth weight < 5th centile) and antepartum or intrapartum
fetal death. Adverse neonatal outcome included neona-
tal death, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular
hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary
dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of
prematurity, seizure and admission to the neonatal unit
for more than 48 h (for full-term infant).
Statistical analysis
Outcome data were obtained from maternity databases
as
well
as
from
detailed
review
of
the
patient’s
hospital notes. Categorical data are presented as number
and percentage and continuous data as median and
interquartile range. The chi-square test, or Fisher’s
exact test when appropriate, was used to compare
categorical variables. The Mann–Whitney U-test was
used for analysis of continuous data. P < 0.05 was
deemed statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
RESULTS
There were 166 women included in the analysis: 108
who had performed HBPM (with results recorded on the
smartphone app in 29 cases and in their medical notes in
79 cases) and 58 control patients managed conventionally.
Three (2.7%) of the women who were approached for
HBPM declined, as they were not confident in using
the technology. Two (1.8%) who commenced HBPM
were excluded at their first review as it became clear
they were non-compliant; they reverted to traditional
care. Demographic characteristics and diagnosis at the
beginning of blood-pressure monitoring and at the end
of pregnancy are presented in Table 1. There were
significantly more women with chronic hypertension in
the HBPM group compared with controls (49.1% vs
25.9%, P = 0.004). Significantly fewer patients developed
PE in the HBPM group compared with the control
group (20.4% vs 34.5%, P = 0.046). Across both HBPM
and control groups, 20.6% of women with chronic
hypertension and 32.1% of those with GH developed PE.
The duration of outpatient monitoring was significantly
longer in the HBPM group (8.9 vs 4.9 weeks, P = 0.004;
Table 2). Patients in the HBPM group had significantly
fewer visits per patient to the DAU (4 vs 6, P < 0.001).
When also including other blood pressure-related visits
to antenatal services (hypertension clinic, out-of-hours
maternity
triage,
obstetric
and
midwifery
antenatal
clinic and general practitioner), the HBPM group had
significantly fewer antenatal visits per patient (6.5 vs 8.0,
P = 0.003). When calculated as the number of visits per
patient per week, the HBPM group still had fewer visits
compared with the control group (0.8 vs 1.6, P < 0.001).
On subgroup analysis (Table 3), women with chronic
hypertension in the HBPM group had significantly fewer
visits per patient to the DAU and fewer antenatal visits
overall per patient per week compared with the control
group. Women with GH also had significantly fewer visits

was no difference in visits overall per patient per week.
There was no significant difference between the HBPM

There was no significant difference between the HBPM
group and controls in the number of days of blood

days in HDU per patient between the two groups
(Table 2). There were also no significant differences
between the groups in terms of gestational age at
delivery, birth weight, admission to the neonatal unit,

maternal, fetal or neonatal adverse outcome (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Summary of study findings
Our results demonstrate that HBPM significantly reduced
the number of DAU visits for blood pressure monitoring
compared with traditional outpatient antenatal monitor-
ing. HBPM was also associated with a significant reduc-
tion in antenatal outpatient visits overall per patient for
hypertension-related reasons, and this reduction remained
significant when taking into account differences in the
duration of monitoring. The duration of monitoring was
significantly longer in the HBPM group, which is likely to
be due to the greater proportion of patients with chronic
hypertension, who are likely to have started monitoring
at an earlier gestational age. There were no significant
differences in the number of days of hospital or HDU
admission per person or any other markers of adverse
maternal, fetal or neonatal outcome between the HBPM
and the control group.
Interpretation of study findings and comparison with
the literature
There is limited published literature on HBPM in
hypertensive pregnant women. Our results demonstrate
a lower number of visits to antenatal services by
hypertensive pregnant women using HBPM, with no
increase in adverse outcome for either mother or baby,
compared with controls managed traditionally. Although
our study was possibly underpowered to assess the adverse
maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes, our findings are
supported by previous studies of home monitoring in
women with GH14–16. In their pilot study, Lanssens
et al.14 compared retrospectively antenatal attendance
and pregnancy outcome in 55 hypertensive women using
remote monitoring with those in a hypertensive group
managed by traditional means. Whilst they reported fewer
hospital attendances in the remote-monitoring group, the
difference was not significant on multivariate analysis.
Importantly, their study populations differed, with the
remote-monitoring group having fewer pre-eclamptic
women, and the study utilized blood-pressure monitors
that were not validated for use in pregnancy. Furthermore,
the retrospective nature of their study increases the
possibility of selection bias. Barton et al.15,16 reported
similar maternal and perinatal outcomes, in their study of
a large cohort of hypertensive pregnant women using
HBPM. Although they also reported fewer days of
hospital admission in the HBPM group, this difference
was inevitable as the control group was a historical cohort
managed as inpatients. The findings were also limited by
a non-standardized management protocol defined by the
patient’s individual private physicians.
Study strengths and limitations
There were no significant differences between the HBPM
and control groups with respect to maternal age, BMI,
ethnicity, parity and smoking status, thereby reducing
the risk of confounding for adverse outcome. Our study
also benefits from robust data and outcome collection, in
which all hospital notes as well as maternity databases
were reviewed in order to gain detailed information about
the numbers of visits and admissions, as well as pregnancy
outcome. Furthermore, pregnant women in the HBPM
group were reviewed by one specialist midwife, reducing
variation in practice and related biases.
One of the limitations of our study is that the majority
of patients in the HBPM group had chronic hypertension,
whereas the control group had significantly more women
with GH. This makes comparisons between the groups

harder to interpret, as any differences may have been
due to management of the underlying condition rather
than HBPM itself. However, firstly, subgroup analysis
demonstrated that, in HBPM patients compared with
controls, there were still significantly fewer DAU and
total outpatient visits when only the patients with chronic
hypertension were analyzed, and significantly fewer DAU
visits when only patients with GH were analyzed.
Secondly, the control group was recruited retrospectively,
meaning that selection bias cannot be excluded. Finally,
our HBPM protocol was designed to comply with the
organization and recommended practice of antenatal care
in the UK, which may not be representative of antenatal
care in other countries. This should be considered when
applying the results to other populations.
Clinical and research implications
Despite the paucity of evidence regarding the use
of
HBPM
in
pregnancy,
many
professional
bodies
acknowledge its potential benefits and the need for further
research8,17,18. This is one of few studies to compare
HBPM with traditional monitoring in a hypertensive
pregnant population. The finding of a reduction in number
of hospital visits for hypertension-related reasons without
an increase in maternal or fetal harm suggests that a large
randomized trial is justified.
If women developed PE while using HBPM, they
reverted to the traditional care pathway. Therefore, our
findings cannot be applied to a PE population and the
role of HBPM in PE remains unclear. Concerns over
differences in home and clinic blood-pressure readings
of PE patients using an automated device and mercury
sphygmomanometry have been reported19, and, although
validation studies for devices used in pregnancy often
include PE patients, readings in this group may be less
accurate11,20,21. Our study was not designed to compare
the ability of HBPM with that of traditional monitoring
to detect PE and this is an important question to be
addressed in future research.
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in pregnancy
has been shown to be effective in diagnosing white-coat
hypertension and therefore reducing unnecessary inter-
vention; HBPM is likely to offer a similar benefit22,23.
Conversely, it would be hoped that HBPM would allow
for earlier detection of severe hypertension and PE by
virtue of the patient’s blood pressure being measured
more frequently than if they were attending traditional
outpatient monitoring. The fact that significantly fewer
patients in the HBPM group progressed to PE may be
explained by the fact that HBPM, as compared with con-
ventional care, offers closer follow-up in women at risk
for PE, allowing for better fine-tuning of antihypertensive
therapy, with subsequent lower risk for progression to
a more advanced and severe stage of the disease; how-
ever, the difference was small and should be interpreted
with caution in view of the differences in the underlying
diagnoses. Studies on ambulatory blood pressure mon-
itoring have shown higher 24-h readings, as compared
with routine blood-pressure measurements, in patients
who subsequently develop PE or fetal growth restriction;
however, refinement is required to enable these measures
to be used as a prognostic tool22–26.
HBPM is acceptable to patients and does not appear
to increase anxiety27,28. It requires fewer visits to
hospital, which can save both time and money for
patients. Already, many patients self-monitor their blood
pressure in pregnancy without the advice of a healthcare
professional and using a large variety of devices10,11. It is
therefore important to develop evidence-based protocols
to ensure that this practice is performed safely. Finally,
HBPM has the potential to offer cost savings and service
improvements by reducing the number of lengthy visits
required. This is important in both low- and high-income
settings, all of which are under pressure to streamline
services.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that using HBPM in hypertensive
pregnancies has the potential to reduce the number of
hospital visits required by patients without compromising
safety. A larger prospective study is now warranted to
explore further whether HBPM can make a difference
in terms of requirements for antihypertensive treatment
and early delivery for blood pressure-related reasons, and
maternal and fetal adverse outcome.
