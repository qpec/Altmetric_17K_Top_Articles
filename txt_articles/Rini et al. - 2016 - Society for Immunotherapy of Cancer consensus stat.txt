Abstract
Immunotherapy has produced durable clinical benefit in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC). In the past,
patients treated with interferon-alpha (IFN) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) have achieved complete responses, many of which
have lasted for multiple decades. More recently, a large number of new agents have been approved for RCC, several of
which attack tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and VEGF receptors (VEGFR),
as well as tumor metabolism, inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Additionally, a new class of
immunotherapy agents, immune checkpoint inhibitors, is emerging and will play a significant role in the treatment of
patients with RCC. Therefore, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a Task Force, which met to
consider the current role of approved immunotherapy agents in RCC, to provide guidance to practicing clinicians by
developing consensus recommendations and to set the stage for future immunotherapeutic developments in RCC.

Introduction
For more than 20 years, immunotherapy using IL-2 or IFN
has been a primary treatment for patients with metastatic
RCC (mRCC) [1–5]. The toxicity of high-dose (HD) IL-2
therapy, in particular, has restricted its use to patients with
adequate organ function and treated at institutions experi-
enced in the management of side effects. Multiple studies
over many years have tried to identify biologic and im-
munologic parameters to pre-select patients for sensitivity
to HD IL-2, but to date there is no biomarker for response
related to the tumor itself or to the patient’s immune profile
that has been prospectively validated. The most recent pro-
spective study demonstrated that clinico/pathologic param-
eters such as excellent performance status and clear cell
histology remain as the best predictors of HD IL-2 respon-
siveness [6]. Investigations have also clarified prognostic
groups, and those for whom immunotherapy is not useful.
The identification of biomarkers predictive of response or
resistance to immunotherapy continues to be the focus of
active research. Over many years of evaluation, it has be-
come apparent that RCC is comprised of a number of dif-
ferent histologic subtypes, now shown to have different
genomic profiles [7]. It has also been noted in mul-
tiple clinical trials and registry experiences that non-
clear cell RCC is much less likely to respond to IL2 or
IFN. The treatment approach for non-clear cell RCC con-
tinues to be explored with optimal subtype-specific strat-
egies yet to be developed.
Since 2005, ten agents have been approved for the
treatment of patients with metastatic clear cell RCC
(which continues to be 75–85 % of mRCC). These in-
clude six agents that target the tyrosine kinase of recep-
tors of VEGF (sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib,
cabozantinib, lenvatinib [in combination with everoli-
mus]) [8–11], two that target mTOR (temsirolimus,
everolimus) [12, 13], and a monoclonal antibody that
binds VEGF before it engages its receptor (bevacizumab)
[14, 15]. These agents have brought treatment options to

 greater numbers of patients with metastatic clear cell RCC.
The selection of patients for different treatment options as
well as the sequencing of these targeted agents relative to
each other continue to be topics of clinical investigation.
Despite an abundance of newer agents, there continues to
be a role, albeit more limited, for cytokine-based immuno-
therapy. In addition, new immunotherapeutic agents are
entering the clinical arena, notably nivolumab, an immune
checkpoint inhibitor for programmed death 1 (PD-1) (nivo-
lumab) [16]. Therefore, optimal sequencing becomes even
more important in order to provide patients with the great-
est chance of durable disease control and survival that is
free from symptoms of disease or treatment.
In the era of anti-angiogenesis therapy, with agents
that are available to nearly all patients with mRCC, SITC
has convened a panel of RCC/immunotherapy experts to
consider the current data and to provide treatment rec-
ommendations to practicing clinicians caring for pa-
tients with RCC, outlining the current and potential
future role of immunotherapy for this disease.
Methods
Consensus statement policy
SITC has adopted a process and standards, initially out-
lined by the Institute of Medicine, to develop clinical
practice guidelines for the use of immunotherapy [17, 18].
This paper is the result of this process in delineating guide-
lines for the use of immunotherapy in the treatment of
renal cell cancer. SITC convened a multi-disciplinary panel
of renal cancer/immunotherapy experts in October 2014
to produce an evidence-based guideline document, trans-
parent with regard to funding as well as the reporting and
management of conflicts of interest. The resulting docu-
ment is designed to provide guidance only. The panel fo-
cused on drugs currently approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients
in the U.S. The final consensus statement and was made
available to the entire SITC membership for open com-
ment. This feedback received during the comment period
were considered for the final manuscript (Additional file 1).
Due to the approval of two agents and release of phase III
data since the convened meeting, additional edits, ap-
proved by all authors, were also incorporated.
Renal cancer consensus Task Force and conflicts of interest
The Task Force consisted of 17 health care providers, all
specializing in the treatment of patients with RCC (12
medical oncologists, 3 urologic oncologists, and 2 oncol-
ogy nurses), as well as 2 patient advocates and 1 patient
(Additional file 2). The providers were particularly expe-
rienced in the management of patients with either ad-
vanced or local/regional disease. More than 80 % had
experience with HD IL-2 and with anti-angiogenesis
agents, and more than 75 % had experience with mTOR
inhibitors. In addition, more than 85 % had experience
with RCC clinical trials. Clinical trial participation
among the Task Force members included studies involv-
ing anti-PD-1 (80 %), anti-PD-L1 (59 %), allogeneic bone
marrow transplantation (29 %), RCC vaccines (45–50 %),
and cabozantinib, a VEGF and MET inhibitor (65 %).
Thus, the Task Force was a highly selected group of ex-
perts with long-standing experience in RCC treatment
and clinical research and reflects the forefront of indi-
viduals conducting clinical trials with the newer agents
for RCC over the past decade. Several Task Force mem-
bers were also involved in the development and conduct
of adjuvant clinical trials in patients with high risk RCC.
All Task Force members were required to disclose any
conflicts of interest related to the treatment of RCC and
the agents to be discussed during the conference. This
included full financial disclosure of relationships with
commercial sponsors of these agents. No commercial
funding was provided for any aspect of the process, in-
cluding the literature search, support of the meeting, or
preparation of the manuscript.
Literature review
The database selected for the literature review was
MEDLINE. The search terms that were utilized included
“kidney cancer or renal cancer and immunotherapy” with
subtopics of “BMT” and “other/vaccine,” “kidney cancer
or renal cancer and interferon,” “cytokine monotherapy”
with subtopics “Bev/interferon” and “Peg-IFN,” “kidney
cancer or renal cancer and IL2,” and “kidney cancer or
renal cancer and anti-PD-1.” The literature search was
supplemented with additional papers identified by the
Task Force at the time of the consensus meeting. This re-
sulted in a 290-item bibliography (Additional file 3).
The level of evidence reported in the literature was
placed into one of three levels. Level A was considered the
strongest supportive evidence, demonstrated by random-
ized, controlled trials and/or by meta-analyses as well as
by long-term follow-up of prospective, uncontrolled trials
in the case of HD IL-2. Level B was considered moderate
evidence supported by more recent prospective, uncon-
trolled trials, and level C was considered weak evidence,
derived from case reports and retrospective reviews.
Task Force consensus meeting agenda
Topics discussed with respect to immunotherapy of RCC
were the following: 1) the current role and place of HD IL-2
therapy; 2) the selection of patients for IL-2-based regimens
and the criteria for those choices; 3) the current role of IFN
and its use in conjunction with bevacizumab; 4) the identifica-
tion of biomarkers of response to immunotherapy; 5) the se-
quencing of immunotherapy with the anti-VEGF agents; 6)
the management of patients with central nervous system
(CNS) metastases; 7) the potential role and sequencing of

 new immunotherapy agents including the PD-1/PD-L1
pathway inhibitors; 8) future opportunities and the role of
immunotherapy-based combination therapies for RCC.
The pre-meeting survey questions and Task Force re-
sponses are also available in full (Additional file 4).
It was agreed that the data supporting the use of IL-2
originates from older studies, rather than phase III com-
parative trials, and therefore, the basis for recommenda-
tions regarding this agent reflects decades of clinical
experience. Because of the need for careful selection of
patients for HD IL-2, historical data must be the basis for
recommendations. More recently, a prospective phase II
clinical trial of HD IL-2 suggested that in the current era
of alternative treatment options, patients felt to be appro-
priate for HD IL2 treatment experience a higher response
rate than in the initial reports (25 vs. 14 %) [6]. Addition-
ally, registry data from treatment centers in the current
era demonstrate enhanced activity and reduced severe
toxicity for this treatment approach [19, 20].
Consensus recomendations
What is the role of systemic therapy for resected stage II/
III renal cell cancer?
Although clinical trials of HD IL-2 and of IFN were con-
ducted as adjuvant therapy, results did not support their
use in this setting [21, 22]. VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibi-
tors (TKIs) sorafenib and sunitinib did not demonstrate
benefit relative to placebo in the E2805 ASSURE trial [23].
However, recent preliminary data from S-TRAC indicate a
relapse-free survival benefit to sunitinib over placebo in pa-
tients with resected high-risk RCC [24]. Full details regard-
ing this trial including overall survival and relative toxicity
are awaited to determine if sunitinib will be a new standard
of care in this setting. Other ongoing adjuvant clinical trials
awaiting results include: EVEREST (S0931, NCT01120249),
a phase III comparison of everolimus versus placebo in the
North American Cooperative Groups, which will complete
accrual shortly and SORCE, a randomized phase III trial of
one year of sorafenib versus three years of sorafenib versus
observation conducted in Europe, which completed accrual
and is pending analysis [25]. In addition, two industry-
sponsored trials (PROTECT and ATLAS) are ongoing.
Literature review and analysis
The earliest adjuvant trials in patients with completely
resected RCC were with IFN. The North American Co-
operative Groups conducted an intergroup study, enrol-
ling from 1987–1992, in which 283 patients with pT3-4a
and/or lymph node positive patients were randomized to
observation or to IFN alfa-NL, administered daily for
5 days, every 3 weeks, for up to 12 cycles [22]. At a me-
dian follow-up of 10.4 years, the median survival was
7.4 years in the observation group, and 5.1 years in the
IFN group (log rank p = 0.9). Median recurrence-free
survival (RFS) was 3.0 years for the observation group and
2.2 years in the IFN group (p = .33). The investigators con-
cluded that adjuvant treatment with IFN did not contrib-
ute to survival or RFS [22]. The Cytokine Working Group
(CWG) conducted an adjuvant study in a mixed popula-
tion of 69 resected locally advanced or metastatic patients,
comparing HD IL-2 to observation [21]. Early closure was
recommended after an interim analysis determined that
the goal of a 30 % improvement in 2-year disease-free sur-
vival (DFS) could not be achieved with further accrual.
As stated above, a number of randomized, placebo-
controlled adjuvant trials utilizing anti-VEGF agents or
anti-mTOR agents are being completed and/or undergo-
ing analysis. The first report was of ASSURE in 2015,
demonstrating no difference in RFS comparing sunitinib
to placebo or sorafenib to placebo [23]. Ongoing genomic
studies may provide insights into differing populations
among the patients in this trial. Considerable enthusiasm
is developing for adjuvant trials of checkpoint inhibitors
in resected RCC and such trials are in development.
Consensus recommendations
The entire Task Force agreed that the current standard of
care in the adjuvant setting is either observation or enroll-
ment in a clinical trial based on Level A evidence for cyto-
kines [21, 22] and Level A evidence from the ASSURE
clinical trial [23]. The panel was supportive of initiation of
studies utilizing PD-1 pathway blocking agents in the neo-
adjuvant and/or adjuvant setting and such trials are in de-
velopment (Table 2). The preliminary S-TRAC data
release, which occurred after the meeting, may impact
both the standard of care and the control arms of future
clinical trials in this setting.
What is the role of surgery for stage IV renal cell cancer?
Initial assessment of a patient with mRCC
Patients with mRCC should be evaluated for histologic
subtype and extent of metastatic disease, including
evaluation of the CNS. In the presence of small volume
metastatic disease, relative to the tumor volume in the
primary site, cytoreductive nephrectomy is often recom-
mended prior to systemic therapy [26–29]. Data suggest
improved survival associated with cytoreductive neph-
rectomy in the cytokine era [26–29] and preliminarily
also with VEGFR pathway targeted therapy [30]. If there
are isolated distant metastases, these may be considered
for resection as data support this approach [31, 32]. Sys-
temic therapy is not indicated after metastasectomy in the
absence of residual disease except as part of a research
study. There is an ongoing cooperative group clinical trial
evaluating pazopanib versus placebo in the setting of
resected metastatic disease (E2810, NCT01575948).
However, if patients have a large tumor burden outside
of the kidney, particularly symptomatic distant metastases,
Rini et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:81 
Page 3 of 15
 or poor performance status/co-morbidities, then initiating
therapy without nephrectomy may be appropriate and
should be strongly considered as part of a multi-
disciplinary discussion.
Literature review and analysis
Early studies demonstrated improved survival in patients
presenting with metastatic disease, who subsequently
underwent nephrectomy and were then treated with
IFN, compared in randomized trials with those only
treated systemically [27–29]. Similarly, nephrectomy
prior to HD IL-2 confers benefit [26]. A more recent re-
port suggests that this benefit may be limited to selected
patients, with survival being primarily improved in pa-
tients with favorable Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSKCC) or Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) prognostic features among patients
treated with VEGF-targeted therapies [30]. Several re-
ports also describe survival benefit from resection of
concurrent or recurrent metastatic disease, again in
highly selected patients [31, 32].
Consensus recommendations
These comments were discussed as part of the general
discussion and were not voted on. In general, the Task
Force agreed that nephrectomy remains an important
component of management of patients with mRCC
based on Level A evidence for IFN and IL-2 [26–29] and
Level C evidence for VEGF-targeted agents [30, 32]. The
resection of oligometastases is supported by Level C evi-
dence [31, 32]. It is unclear how novel immunotherapy
may impact these surgical approaches.
Immunotherapy for mRCC
In the setting of residual metastatic disease, following
nephrectomy, or recurrent metastatic disease, the Task
Force discussed the role of first-line treatment with im-
munotherapy versus VEGF or mTOR targeted therapy
for metastatic disease. The outcome of this discussion is
outlined below and summarized in a treatment algorithm
for patients with stage IV RCC (Fig. 1).
What is the current role of HD IL-2 in the treatment of mRCC?
IL-2 is a cytokine that was initially called “T cell growth
factor” [33] that activates both effector and regulatory T
cells. It has shown clinical antitumor activity in preclin-
ical models and clinical trials leading to its FDA ap-
proval in patients with advanced RCC in 1992 and
melanoma in 1998 [2–4].
The FDA approval for HD IL-2 was based on the po-
tential for a small subset of treated patients to achieve
durable complete responses, which may last for decades.
Therefore, centers that treat patients with mRCC fre-
quently
screen
for
HD
IL-2
candidates
prior
to
considering other types of agents as initial treatment.
Research to develop biomarkers of responsiveness has
been ongoing. However, criteria for patient selection re-
main clinical at this time. Many IL-2 treatment centers
recommend HD IL-2 as initial treatment for patients with
mRCC, depending upon the patient’s clinical condition
and perceived ability to tolerate this therapy. Others rec-
ommend clinical trials since some, especially those evalu-
ating frontline use of checkpoint inhibitors, preclude
patients with prior therapy of any kind including HD IL-2.
Literature review and analysis
HD IL-2 was approved for treatment of mRCC in 1992,
based on summarized data from 7 clinical trials consist-
ing of 255 patients [3]. The overall response rate (ORR)
was 15 % (37/255), including 17 complete (CR) and 20
partial responses (PR). Sixty percent of the PRs had
more than 90 % reduction in tumor burden, and some
were rendered complete responders by further surgery.
The median duration of response was 54 months, in-
cluding a median of 20 months for PR patients and me-
dian not reached for CR patients. The median survival
for all 255 patients was 16 months [3].
Subsequent reports with data from a median of 10 years
follow-up showed that 60 % of CR patients remained in
complete remission. Additionally, 4 PR patients who under-
went surgery of residual disease to achieve CR remained
alive and disease-free at more than 65 + months [2, 4].
More recently, the CWG conducted a prospective, bio-
marker validation study entitled “SELECT” in which
clinical and some biologic features were evaluated as po-
tential selection factors for best response [6]. This study
again demonstrated that HD IL-2 therapy yielded durable
remission and prolonged survival in patients with mRCC.
These results were achieved in patients considered both
“poor” risk and “favorable” based on retrospectively derived
criteria [34]. Clinico/pathologic criteria appeared to select
for better outcome, such as clear cell histology (96 % of
subjects) and prior nephrectomy (99 % of subjects), and
these reflected selection prior to enrollment in the trial,
based on previous clinical experience. This study demon-
strated improved results compared to the historical studies
postulated to be based primarily on better patient selection.
One hundred and twenty eligible patients were enrolled,
70 % of them being intermediate risk based on MSKCC cri-
teria. The independently evaluated ORR was 25 %, with 3
CRs and 27 PRs. Thirteen patients (11 %) remained
progression-free at 3 years from treatment, and the median
overall survival (OS) was 42.8 months [6]. Biomarkers that
were evaluated and not found to be predictive of response
were histologic subtype and CA-IX score by immunohisto-
chemistry. Positive expression of PD-L1 in the tumor (18
patients) did significantly correlate with response, but this
result requires validation [35].

 Additional new data on outcomes with HD IL-2 treat-
ment has been derived from single institution reports
and the development of a national database registry of
initially retrospective patients and now ongoing pro-
spective collection of treatment and outcome data for
HD IL-2 (PROCLAIM NCT 01415167,) [19, 20].
PROCLAIM data on the retrospective cohort of 97 pa-
tients with mRCC treated between 2007 and 2012 at 13
sites was presented in 2015. The ORR was 22 % (8 % CR
and 14 % PR). The median OS was 51 months for the en-
tire cohort. For those patients achieving CR, PR or stable
disease (SD) > 6 months, the median OS has not been
reached [19]. The median OS for those patients who dir-
ectly progressed after IL-2 therapy was 37.9 months.
There were no deaths due to IL-2 related toxicity among
the 97 patients. Additionally, the median OS for those pa-
tients treated with HD IL-2 as first-line therapy was
61.8 months (n = 82) compared with a median OS of
Fig. 1 Stage IV renal cell carcinoma (RCC) immunotherapy treatment algorithm. All treatment options shown may be appropriate. The final selection of
therapy should be individualized based on patient eligibility and the availability of each therapy at the treating physician’s discretion. 1) “Risk” refers to
prognostic risk group per Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and/or International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium
(IMDC) classification [49, 83]. 2) For patients with small-volume, indolent metastases, an initial period of observation can be considered accounting for
patient age/comorbidities, patient preference, and toxicity of available therapy. 3) A clinical trial, including those that are immunotherapy-based, should be
considered in all RCC patients in all lines of therapy. 4) As noted in the manuscript, HD IL2 should be considered and discussed with mRCC patients with
clear cell histology and good performance status. 5) For patients with advanced non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), if available a clinical trial is the
preferred initial treatment option, including trials of checkpoint inhibitors for which limited data exists regarding efficacy in non-clear cell RCC. If unavailable,
then a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is preferred given results from two small randomized trials showing a slight advantage over mTOR inhibitors in
this setting [81, 82]. 6) Nivolumab is an appropriate initial recommendation in refractory RCC in the absence of contraindications given the overall survival
benefit and tolerability. Other options (TKI, HD IL-2 and mTOR inhibitors) can be considered depending on patient performance status, comorbidities, prior
therapy received and preference. Figure adapted from Kaufman et al., 2013 [18]

 15.3 months for those treated with IL-2 as second-line
therapy (n = 15) [19]. Additional single institution data
have been published, demonstrating similarly improved
ORR and survival in the modern era [36].
Consensus recommendations
The Task Force was divided about the degree of the role
that HD IL-2 has in initial treatment of patients with
mRCC. The overall opinion was that appropriate pa-
tients with mRCC who have undergone nephrectomy, ei-
ther in the past or as a cytoreductive intervention,
should have a discussion about IL-2 and be referred to
centers of excellence for further discussion when appro-
priate. Sixty-seven percent recommended that all such
patients have a discussion regarding IL-2, whereas 33 %
preferred to select the patients for that discussion. This
recommendation was based on Level A evidence from
long-term follow-up of multiple clinical trials [2–4] and
Level B as well as C evidence from more recent pro-
spective, uncontrolled clinical trials and clinical experi-
ence as noted in the literature review [6, 20, 25, 37].
What are the criteria for considering IL-2 therapy?
The Task Force discussed in detail the clinical and bio-
logical criteria required for consideration of treatment
with HD IL-2 (Table 1). These are specific to HD IL-2,
but some criteria may also be applicable to emerging
immunotherapy.
Literature review and analysis
Several clinical studies have demonstrated poorer out-
comes of patients with non-clear cell RCC compared
with those having clear cell RCC, after treatment with cyto-
kines such as IL-2 or IFN [7, 12, 37]. A retrospective review
of histology showed markedly improved outcome among
patients with clear cell RCC after IL-2 therapy, compared
with those with mixed histology or those with extensive
granular features [37]. In this study, among patients with
clear cell and favorable features (alveolar but no papillary or
granular features) the ORR was 39 % (n = 36), and in pa-
tients with clear cell with < 50 % granular features, ORR was
19 % (n = 146). Among others including non-clear cell, the
ORR was 6 % [37]. This report provided preliminary data
that led to the evaluation of tumor histology that was pro-
spectively evaluated in the renal SELECT clinical trial [6].
With respect to sarcomatoid differentiation, studies de-
scribe rapid clinical deterioration and report poorer out-
comes overall among patients whose tumors have these
features, regardless of treatment approach [38, 39]. Wu et
al. described 7 patients with sarcomatoid histology, none of
which responded to treatment with HD IL-2. Median sur-
vival among these patients was 13 months compared with a
median survival of 39 months in 63 patients with clear cell
RCC treated with HD IL-2. All were treated in the pre-
VEGF pathway inhibitor era in a single institution [38].
Evaluations of potential biomarkers of response to HD
IL-2 have been ongoing but have not provided guidance
for specific populations who are more likely to respond.
The prospective SELECT trial evaluated several bio-
markers, such as tumor CA-IX expression, but this did
not predict response. Further exploration of expression
of PD-L1 as a biomarker of disease behavior and/or re-
sponse to immunotherapy is ongoing [35]. Clinical selec-
tion by the above criteria remained the strongest predictors
along with clear cell histology [6].
Consensus recommendations
In terms of biology, the histology of the renal tumor should
be the first consideration [7, 38]. The majority of the Task
Force felt that only patients with clear cell histology should be
considered for HD IL-2. The Task Force discussed whether
patients with tumors having sarcomatoid features should
receive IL-2, and 40 % of participants would exclude such
patients. Others would consider such patients, depending
upon the proportion of sarcomatoid features noted and
the biologic behavior of the disease (rapid or indolent).
Thirteen percent would exclude patients with extensive
granular features or Fuhrman grade 4 histology based on
retrospective data [37]. PD-L1 expression versus a marker
for aggressive RCC or a combination of both were dis-
cussed as biomarkers to predict sensitivity to IL-2 as sug-
gested in the SELECT trial. However, this will need to be
further verified [6, 35]. The level of evidence supporting
the recommendations related to pathology are considered
Level C, based on retrospective reviews [7, 12, 37–39] and
Level B, based on a prospective, uncontrolled trial [6].

 Clinical and physiologic criteria should also be evalu-
ated prior to recommending HD IL-2. The following
have long been established as criteria for patients to
undergo HD IL-2 treatment: adequate heart and lung
function; ECOG performance status 0–1, preferably 0;
age (physiologic versus chronologic), but the upper limit
for both is usually in the upper 70s; and absence of CNS
metastases (or treated metastases, with no residual
edema) [40, 41]. The Task Force agreed upon these and
established a series of criteria and rated their level of im-
portance (Table 1). This was based on Level A evidence
from long-term follow-up in multiple trials [2–4, 40, 41].
What is the role of immunotherapy in mRCC patients with
CNS metastases?
The development of CNS metastases is not rare in mRCC
and remains a criterion for exclusion from clinical trials.
However, there are multiple modalities for treatment of
small volume CNS lesions, including surgery and stereo-
tactic radiation. When these modalities are successful, the
previous CNS metastases do not alone preclude proceed-
ing with systemic treatment of mRCC, including immu-
notherapy. The concern with HD IL-2 is the risk of
increasing brain edema when administered to patients
with untreated CNS metastases, and therefore, most clini-
cians screen for CNS involvement prior to starting HD IL-
2. However, occasionally small lesions are not identified
and such patients have been treated.
Literature review and analysis
Retrospective reports from the early decades of therapy with
HD IL-2 have described treatment of patients with either
treated or untreated CNS metastatic disease [42–44]. A
report from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
described the outcome of 138 patients with mRCC who
developed CNS metastases from 1989 to 2006 [42]. In this
study, those with symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions as
well as the total number of lesions were characterized. The
results illustrated that patients with solitary lesions were less
likely to develop additional CNS lesions. In addition, se-
lected patients were able to proceed with HD IL-2 and expe-
rienced prolonged survival [42]. In this series, the median
survival after diagnosis of CNS metastases was 10.7 months,
and the 5-year survival was 12 %. Patients receiving HD IL-
2 after CNS treatment had a response rate of 17 %.
Retrospective data from the National Cancer Institute
consisted of more than 1000 patients with either melan-
oma or mRCC who were treated with HD IL-2 with or
without other therapy from 1985 to 2000 [43]. Patients
with previously treated CNS metastases (n = 27) had an
ORR of 18.5 %, and those with no brain metastases
(n = 1005) had an ORR of 19.8 % [43]. Two of 36 pa-
tients with untreated CNS lesions demonstrated ob-
jective response of both intracranial and extracranial
disease. This report stated that there were no differ-
ences in toxicity profile or reasons for stopping IL-2
among those with CNS lesions and those without.
A third retrospective report described the manage-
ment of CNS metastases in patients with mRCC, with
the use of stereotactic radiation therapy (SRS) from 2000
to 2006 [44]. Among 32 patients with 71 CNS lesions,
local control was achieved in 22 patients and 42 lesions.
Whereas the median survival of all patients with CNS me-
tastases was 10 months, 16 % achieved 3 year survival. In
addition, these patients were able to proceed to systemic
immunotherapy, including HD IL-2 and IFN [44].
Two later reports of patients with melanoma also de-
scribe the objective response of intracranial metastases
to immunotherapy (HD IL-2 and adoptive cell therapy),
confirming the ability of immunotherapy to induce re-
gressions of intracranial tumors [45, 46].
Consensus recommendations
Given the heterogeneous and retrospective nature of the
information available regarding management of CNS
metastases in patients with mRCC, the Task Force felt
that proceeding with HD IL-2 in this setting is individu-
alized and relies on clinical judgment.
With respect to patients presenting with CNS metasta-
sis, 47 % of the Task Force preferred the use of a VEGFR
TKI after local treatment of the CNS disease. However,
40 % would treat the CNS lesion(s) with either surgery
of stereotactic RT first, and then consider proceeding
with HD IL2, if other criteria are met. The level of evi-
dence for the recommendation for use of IL-2 was consid-
ered Level A, based on long-term follow-up [42, 43] and
Level C based on short-term, retrospective data [44].
What is the role of evaluation of risk factor prognostic
categories in deciding treatment approach?
Several groups have evaluated clinical and laboratory fea-
tures of patients with mRCC and have developed algo-
rithms that define prognosis and survival. The initial report
was developed retrospectively among patients treated with
IFN [34], and additional retrospective studies demonstrated
similar delineations of patients into favorable, intermediate
(majority of mRCC) and poor risk groups [47, 48]. Subse-
quent evaluations have assessed risk criteria among patients
treated with VEGF pathway inhibitors and have demon-
strated consistent results [49]. The evaluation of such
prognostic information has become useful in evaluating
outcome of clinical trials by strata, as well as adding infor-
mation when considering treatment options for patients.
Literature review and analysis
In the prospective SELECT trial, HD IL-2 produced dur-
able remissions and prolonged survival in both good and
poor risk patients according to MSKCC criteria; however,
Rini et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:81 
Page 7 of 15
 the poor risk patients were few in number [6]. Reports in
clinical trials [8–12] and in the modern prognostic factor
analyses with immune and targeted therapy [47–49]
demonstrate the greatest treatment benefit for patients
with mRCC to be among those with favorable and inter-
mediate risk.
Consensus recommendations
Regarding the use of the prognostic categories that have
been developed for predicting survival of patients with
mRCC, the consensus of the Task Force was that these cri-
teria are used for treatment decisions. Poor risk patients,
with expected shortened survival are not considered initial
candidates for HD IL-2, and the majority (53 %) would
proceed with anti-VEGFR TKI, 20 % with temsirolimus, and
27 % with clinical trials, if available, in the setting of poor
risk patients. These recommendations are based on Level B
evidence from long-term retrospective reviews [34, 47–49]
and Level B evidence from a prospective trial with IL-2 [16]
as well as Level C evidence from retrospective evaluations of
risk categories in studies of targeted therapies [8–15].
What are considerations of duration of treatment with HD
IL-2 and when to change therapy?
There was discussion regarding retreatment of patients
following the first course of HD IL-2. Although chemo-
therapy treatment in oncology utilizes repetitive treatment
cycles, the necessary treatment duration for immunother-
apy continues to be evaluated. It is conceivable that once
activation of the immune system occurs, additional treat-
ment does not result in additional benefit.
Literature review and analysis
Based on the SELECT trial and PROCLAIM data, SD
may be a therapeutic effect of IL-2. In SELECT, there
was an ORR of 25 %, with 3 CRs and 27 PRs. The me-
dian duration of response was 20.6 months, and 13 pa-
tients progression-free at 3 years. There were 9 patients
with SD lasting more than 6 months. The median OS
was 43 months for all 120 patients [6]. In the retrospect-
ive and prospective PROCLAIM registry, which is still
accumulating patient data, the response rate is 20 %, and
the median OS has not been reached for the prospective
category of patients [19]. The survival of stable patients
aligned with the responders and was considerably better
that that of the progressing patients [19].
Consensus recommendations
There were different opinions as to whether more than
one course of HD IL-2 should be given to those patients
who respond or are stable. In patients with responding
or SD 12 weeks following HD IL-2, 80 % would give a
second two week course of therapy. Thirteen percent
would continue to observe, especially in patients with
SD, until progression is documented, and then start an-
other treatment. Anecdotal patients were discussed who
achieved a durable CR with one course of HD IL-2. It
has not been prospectively evaluated whether patients
who have SD as their best response to the first course of
HD IL-2 can achieve either a better response or delayed
progression with additional courses of therapy. However,
if no contraindication existed, the majority of the Task
Force would proceed with a second course before chan-
ging treatment. The level of evidence was considered
Level C, based on retrospective data and case anecdotes.
What options are recommended at progression following
HD IL-2?
For many years additional immunotherapy or clinical trials
were the only treatment options. In initial exploratory clin-
ical trials of VEGF and mTOR pathway inhibitors, most of
the patients had progressed on prior immunotherapy,
which did not have a negative effect on outcome [50, 51].
Therefore, data and clinical experience exist to inform
the management of patients following HD IL-2. This
decision clearly depends on the timing of progression
(immediate vs years later), type and degree of pro-
gression, rate of progression, and previous experience
with HD IL-2 treatment.
Literature review and analysis
Data for proceeding with additional HD IL-2 come from
experience in patients for whom this had been their only
option. Anecdotal experience has demonstrated subse-
quent responses to HD IL-2, after a hiatus of time from the
initial treatment. Also, long-term follow-up data from IL-2
studies show patients with surgically completed complete
responses continue to demonstrate long term remission
[52]. Subsequent treatment with anti-angiogenesis agents
or mTOR inhibitors has likewise demonstrated benefit in
patients who progressed on cytokines [13, 50, 51]. There
are limited data on activity of checkpoint pathway inhibi-
tors following treatment with HD IL-2.
Consensus recommendations
There was a difference of opinion regarding options at
progression, even if response to IL-2 lasted at least
6 months: 73 % would proceed to another therapy,
whereas 13 % would recommend another course of HD
IL-2. Another 13 % would recommend resection of re-
sidual disease if possible to remove all such disease.
In a follow-up discussion, the consensus was that pa-
tients who have major response to 2 courses of IL-2,
who have residual oligometastatic disease should be
managed with surgical resection of residual disease
(73 %), another course of IL-2 (20 %), or switch to TKI
(7 %). All data was considered anecdotal, and therefore,
clinical judgment is the deciding factor at this time.

 What is the role of Low dose IL-2 or low dose IL-2 combined
with IFN?
Low dose regimens have been studied in the past, including
low dose intravenous (IV) administration on the same
schedule as HD IL-2, low dose subcutaneous (SQ) adminis-
tration, 5 days/week for indeterminate time frame, a decres-
cendo dosing schedule of SQ IL2, and SQ administration of
both low dose IL-2 and IFN, among others. Although dur-
able complete responders have been documented with all
of these regimens, the ORR is lower than with HD IL-2 in
the IV bolus dose and the SQ injection schedule [53, 54].
Literature review and analysis
A low dose IV regimen of IL-2 was noted to yield dur-
able CRs in some patients, albeit in smaller numbers,
and this regimen was safe in patients with organ dys-
function [53–55]. Additionally, studies have been re-
ported in which alternate schedules of HD IL-2 have
been utilized, and appear to be more tolerable with simi-
lar efficacy [56, 57]. These should be further evaluated,
particularly in the context of combinations.
Consensus recommendations
All agreed that there is limited to no role of either low
dose IL-2 regimen as a single agent treatment, with the
possible exception of patients with impaired organ function
based on a prospective, uncontrolled trial (Level B evi-
dence) [55]. Level A efficacy data favoring HD IL-2 com-
pared to low dose IL-2 was based on two randomized,
comparative studies [53, 54]. Level B data on new schedules
was derived from prospective, uncontrolled trials [56, 57].
Investigation of low dose regimens in conjunction with
new immunotherapies is a research consideration, given
that check point pathway inhibitors are being studied at
much lower doses in combination than those used in the
original single agent trials. Alternative schedules should
also be explored in the context of combination immuno-
therapy or immunotherapy with targeted agents.
What is the role of HD IL-2 as second-line therapy after
anti-VEGF TKI in a patient who met eligibility criteria for
HD IL-2 and was not progressing rapidly?
More commonly in the past 10 years, patients with mRCC
are started on an anti-VEGF TKI and upon progression
are referred for consideration of immunotherapy with HD
IL-2 to an institution with such a treatment program. The
Task Force was asked to consider the pros and cons of this
approach in terms of optimizing treatment options for pa-
tients, as well as tolerability of this approach.
Literature review and analysis
Cho et al. reported a small experience in which 40 % of
15 patients treated with prior TKI treatment had unex-
pected cardiac toxicity upon treatment with HD IL-2
[58]. They noted that patients generally had very brief
“wash out” periods after completing treatment with anti-
VEGF TKIs. Lam et al. subsequently reported the success-
ful administration of HD IL-2 after anti-VEGF TKIs have
recommended doing so in the setting of a prolonged break
between therapies [59]. They did, in fact, note unexpected
grade 3 cardiac events in 6/40 patients who were treated
after a short interval. Both reports recommend 8–12
weeks before initiating HD IL-2 therapy [58, 59].
Consensus recommendations
Sixty-seven percent of the Task Force felt that anti-PD-1
agents will be the preferred second-line immunotherapy
in this setting, following initial anti-VEGF TKI. This is
not based on comparative data with other immunother-
apy, but it is based on the logistics of outpatient therapy
of anti-PD-1 and less stringent eligibility criteria. This
second-line position of anti-PD-1 agents is now sup-
ported by Level A data from the recently published ran-
domized phase III trial of nivolumab versus everolimus
in the second-line setting [16].
Currently, if anti-PD-1 agents are not available for use,
then HD IL-2 should be considered as second-line ther-
apy after a washout period in appropriate patients based
on Level C data [58, 59]. Such patients should be evalu-
ated carefully with a cardiac echo and show adequate
cardiac function prior to initiation of IL-2 therapy.
What is the role of HD IL-2 after investigational treatment
with an anti-PD-1 agent?
Data are only now being compiled by the PROCLAIM
registry for centers treating with HD IL-2 and thus no
substantial data are yet available.
Literature review and analysis
There are no prospective studies. However, there is a
single abstract reporting the outcome of patients treated
with HD IL-2 after progression on anti-PD-1 checkpoint
inhibitors. A small report using the PROCLAIM data-
base and a single institution reported on 11 patients, 7
of whom had mRCC. All developed ongoing SD or re-
sponse with a median follow-up of 15 months [60].
Consensus recommendations
There was no formal vote on this topic. However, the
Task Force’s assessment was that HD IL-2 could follow
anti-PD-1 agents based on their lower toxicity profile,
which is associated with fewer persistent immune-
related adverse events compared with other checkpoint
inhibitors (e.g., anti-CTLA-4 agents).
Informally, 73 % felt that this sequence is a consider-
ation, as the two immunotherapy approaches work by
different mechanisms of immune activation and that
anti-PD-1 and IL-2 could potentiate the activity of each
Rini et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:81 
Page 9 of 15
 other. Some of the Task Force members have done this
successfully. The level of evidence for sequencing is cur-
rently Level C. A prospective trial of HD IL-2 following
anti-PD-1 therapy was felt to be worth consideration.
Summary of HD IL-2 recommendation
Eligible patients (clear cell histology with adequate organ
reserve, s/p nephrectomy, with few adverse risk features)
should be considered for IL-2 therapy at centers with
adequate experience. The utility and role of IL-2 prior to
or after checkpoint inhibitors is unknown and requires
further study.
What is the role of IFN in the treatment of RCC?
IFN has been a mainstay in the treatment of RCC for
more than 20 years and has been the control arm for the
initial clinical trials that led to the approval of anti-
VEGF and mTOR targeted therapies [1, 5, 10, 12]. IFN
has anti-proliferative activity, as well as immune stimula-
tory activity, with activation of cellular immunity. Con-
tinued research provides insight into interactions with
signaling pathways for gene transcription, apoptosis, and
immune interactions with Toll-like receptors among
others [61, 62]. IFN has produced CRs in patients with
mRCC, both in the cytokine era and more recently,
following anti-VEGF therapy [1, 5]. Nevertheless, it is a
difficult drug to use because of the chronic administra-
tion as well as the severity and chronicity of side effects.
Literature review and analysis
IFN is currently approved in combination with bevacizu-
mab for treatment of patients with mRCC, based on the
results of two phase III trials comparing the combin-
ation to IFN alone [14, 15, 63, 64]. In these studies, the
combination had a better response rate (26–31 %) com-
pared to IFN alone (13 %) and a prolonged progression-
free survival (PFS) compared with IFN (8.5–10.4 months
versus 5.2–5.4 months). OS was prolonged in both arms,
and approached 2 years. The lack of difference in OS be-
tween arms was thought to be in part due to subsequent
therapy given to patients in both arms after progression.
A subsequent multicenter, phase II trial was conducted,
built on the initial phase III bevacizumab/IFN data, taking
into account the frequent dose reductions of IFN observed
in those studies [64]. This study utilized a reduced dose of
IFN (3 MIU 3×/week versus 9 MIU 3×/week). Compared
with the data from the initial phase III trials, there was re-
duced IFN-related toxicity without compromising efficacy
[64]. The response rate was 28 %, the median PFS was
15.3 months, and OS was 30.7 months.
There appears to be additive benefit for IFN in combin-
ation with bevacizumab, and studies of lower dose IFN ap-
pear to provide a manageable regimen in combination.
There is wider IFN usage outside of North America.
Consensus recommendations
Most members of the Task Force do not use IFN, even
in combination with bevacizumab (60 %) and even at
lower IFN doses, which evolved in the randomized trials
and then was formally evaluated [14, 15, 63–65]. The ef-
ficacy recommendation for single agent IFN is level A,
based on prospective, randomized trials showing that
anti-VEGF receptor and mTOR inhibitor targeted ther-
apies have superior PFS compared to single agent IFN
[10, 12]. The level of evidence for IFN in combination
with bevacizumab being superior to IFN alone is Level
A, based on two randomized, controlled clinical trials
[14, 15, 63, 65]. Among the members of the Task Force,
only 13 % would use IFN as a single agent.
What is the role of PD-1 blockade (either with anti-PD-1
or anti-PD-L1)?
The PD-1 pathway is a checkpoint for immune regula-
tion and suppression at the level of the tumor and im-
mune cell interaction [66]. Inhibition of this pathway
leads to immune activation. Agents that are under inves-
tigation include antibodies to PD-1 and PD-L1 (Table 2),
and clinical trials have demonstrated anti-tumor benefit
including in mRCC [67–69]. Two such agents have been
approved for the treatment of melanoma (nivolumab
and pembrolizumab) and more recently for non-small
cell lung cancer, RCC (nivolumab), urothelial cancer
(atezolizumab), Hodgkin Disease (nivolumab). Nivolumab
was approved for mRCC following progression on a
VEGFR targeted therapy by the FDA in 2015. This ap-
proval was based on Level A evidence in a randomized,
phase III controlled trial demonstrating an OS benefit of
nivolumab compared with everolimus following progres-
sion on anti-VEGFR TKI. There are no comparative data
between immunotherapies at this time. The approval of
PD-1 pathway blockers in RCC will necessitate further
study of sequencing and combination therapy approaches
in this disease, involving immunotherapies and VEGF
pathway targeted therapies. Many such trials are ongoing.
Literature review and analysis
Current longitudinal data for anti-PD-1 agents in mRCC
include a phase II trial of nivolumab, evaluating 3 differ-
ent dose levels. There did not appear to be a dose re-
sponse in this study, and responses were observed at all
three dose levels with an ORR of 21 % and median PFS
of 4 months [70]. Another report provided long-term
follow-up of the expansion cohort of mRCC patients
treated with nivolumab in the initial phase I study, in
which 34 treatment-refractory mRCC patients were en-
rolled [67, 71]. The response rate was 29 % with a
median response duration of 12.9 months, and there
were 9 additional patients (27 %) with stable disease last-
ing beyond 24 weeks. The median OS of all patients was
Rini et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2016) 4:81 
Page 10 of 15
 22.4 months [71]. In a recent update, 3 and 5-year sur-
vival for this patient population was reported to be 41
and 34 % respectively [72]. This data led to a phase II
trial (NCT01354431), which enrolled 167 patients with
VEGR TKI refractory advanced RCC and randomized
them to 3 different dose levels of nivolumab administered
every 3 weeks [70]. Response rates were 20–22 % for each
dose level and median OS ranged from 18 to 25 months.
Updated data were recently presented at ASCO 2016. At a
minimum follow-up of 38 months ORR was 21 % and the
median duration of response was 22 months. In addition,
the 3-year OS rate was 35 % [72].
Recently, results of the phase III clinical trial of nivolu-
mab versus everolimus in second-line treatment of
mRCC were released [16]. The study was stopped early
in July 2015 because data demonstrated a median OS
benefit in patients receiving nivolumab at 25 months
compared with everolimus at 19 months, hazard ratio
0.73, p = 0.002 [16]. Additionally, the objective response
rate for nivolumab was 25 % compared to 5 % for everoli-
mus (p < 0.001). Median PFS was 4.6 months with nivolu-
mab and 4.4 months with everolimus, p = .11. Grade 3 or
4 adverse events deemed related to treatment occurred in
19 % of nivolumab-treated patients and in 37 % of
everolimus-treated patients. This study also evaluated
tumor expression of PD-L1 as a potential biomarker of
treatment effect, with cut-off values at ≥ 1 % and ≥ 5 %.
While expression of PD-L1 correlated with poorer out-
come, it did not predict better response to or survival with
nivolumab compared with everolimus, as patients with
both high and low PD-L1 expressing tumors appeared to
benefit from nivolumab relative to everolimus [16]. This
report led to FDA approval of nivolumab for mRCC as
second line therapy following a VEGFR inhibitor.
A phase I study of the anti-PD-L1 agent, atezolimuzab
reported increased anti-tumor activity in patients whose
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes demonstrated PD-L1 ex-
pression. Additionally, this study showed a response rate of
22 % among patients with clear cell RCC with Fuhrman
grade 4 or sarcomatoid features [73]. It should be noted,
however, that given the low expression of PD-L1 in RCC, 5
out of 9 responders had low PD-L1 expression, highlight-
ing the limited value of assessment of PD-L1 expression
for clinical decision making in patients with mRCC.
Combination studies of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 have
been reported in melanoma with high response rate and
high toxicity rate [74, 75]. This approach is currently
undergoing considerable modification in terms of dose and
schedule and clinical trials of combinations are ongoing in
a variety of diseases, including mRCC (Table 2). Studies of
combinations of PD-1 pathway blockers and anti-VEGF
pathway agents are also ongoing (Table 2 and Table 3).

 Consensus recommendations
At the time of the meeting, phase III studies were not
yet reported and the Task Force discussed the role of
PD-1 pathway blockade in mRCC in light of the avail-
able phase I and II data. There was enthusiasm for this
approach as a single agent, as well as for investigation in
combination with other checkpoint pathway inhibitors
(anti-CTLA-4) and with activating cytokines (IL-2). The
Task Force did vote on their preferred treatment for pa-
tients who have progressed on anti-VEGF TKI therapy,
in the setting of a patient who had received sunitinib for
one year, pazopanib for 8 months, and who remained with
ECOG performance status 1. Sixty-seven percent pre-
ferred anti-PD-1 agents in clinical trials or as a commer-
cial agent, if available. Thirteen percent would choose IL-2
in appropriate patients after TKIs, and 6.7 % would rec-
ommend either axitinib or everolimus. Due to their more
favorable toxicity profiles, many patients as well as physi-
cians would likely prefer immunotherapy with anti-PD-1
agents compared to HD IL-2.
There was considerable enthusiasm for enrolling pa-
tients into ongoing clinical trials of anti-PD-1 agents in
combination therapy. This was preferred even in the
first-line setting where several clinical trials are available
(Table 3). The utilization of expression of PD-L1 as a
biomarker of potential activity of these agents is still
under investigation and not established.
Critical questions regarding checkpoint inhibitor ther-
apy include the value (risk/benefit ratio) of combination
therapy over single agent use, the ability to stop and re-
start therapy (i.e., the need for ongoing treatment), the
development of biomarkers to select patients, and opti-
mizing toxicity management.
What treatment is recommended for metastatic non-clear
cell RCC?
Non-clear cell RCC represents approximately 20–25 %
of surgical cases of RCC, and much less of the mRCC
population. Papillary RCC is the most common subtype
of non-clear cell RCC, representing about 15 % of surgical
series. Other subtypes include chromophobe, collecting
duct, medullary, translocation, and several hereditary syn-
dromes with unique features. Specific molecular character-
istics have been identified separating the various subtypes.
However, to date, except for clear cell RCC, this has not
yet led to a successful treatable target.
Literature review and analysis
Historically, patients with non-clear cell RCC did not fre-
quently respond to treatment with HD IL-2 [2–4]. The HD
IL-2 “SELECT” trial included 5 patients with non-clear cell
RCC, and none responded [6]. In an unplanned analysis of
the outcome of patients in the phase III trial of temsiroli-
mus versus IFN, patients with non-clear cell carcinoma
treated with temsirolimus had a major survival advantage
compared to those treated with IFN, demonstrating either
the effectiveness of temsirolimus or the lack thereof of IFN
in non-clear cell subtypes [12, 76].
Although expanded access trials and small studies of
targeted therapy suggested some response to anti-VEGF
directed therapy, large database reviews report lower re-
sponse rates and poorer median survival among patients
with metastatic non-clear cell RCC compared with clear
cell RCC [77–79]. There is a recently opened NCI-
sponsored clinical trial for patients with papillary RCC
to evaluate a variety of MET-inhibitors, thus targeting a
known genomic feature of some papillary RCC tumors
(S1500). Whether the newer immunotherapies will have
a role in non-clear cell RCC remains to be determined.
A case report describes a dramatic and rapid response of
a single patient with papillary RCC with sarcomatoid
and rhabdoid features to nivolumab [80].
Consensus recommendations
The majority of the Task Force felt that HD IL-2 should
be reserved for patients with clear cell renal cancer,
based on Level A [6] and Level B evidence [2–4]. Data
are insufficient regarding the use of checkpoint pathway
inhibitors in the non-clear cell RCC population, since
very few such patients were entered into the clinical tri-
als of these agents.
There was lack of consensus on the initial treatment
recommendation for patients with metastatic non-clear
cell RCC. Essentially, the Task Force voted for clinical
trials as initial therapy for such patients, provided new
agents or approaches have strong rationale for the spe-
cific subtype. If a clinical trial is unavailable, then a
VEGFR TKI is preferred given results from two small

 randomized trials showing a
slight
advantage
over
mTOR inhibitors in this setting [81, 82].
Conclusions
Immunotherapy remains an established modality for the
treatment of patients with mRCC and continues to pro-
duce durable responses in a subset of patients. Patient
selection for HD IL2 remains based on clinical criteria.
Outcome for HD IL-2 continues to be the gold standard
insofar as there are durable complete remissions. The
approval of nivolumab in previously treated patients
with mRCC and clinical trials with nivolumab and other
PD1 pathway blockers are providing new directions for
immunotherapy in patients with mRCC and will likely
expand the cohort of patients eligible for such therapy.
It is not yet clear whether this approach will provide an
increased number of responders, although the sugges-
tion of response in patients with more aggressive tumors
with anti-PD-L1 therapy is perhaps evidence that HD
IL-2 and PD-1 pathway blockade may have some comple-
mentary anti-tumor efficacy. However, further research is
ongoing, including exploration of combinations, dose and
schedule, and potential consideration of studies in the ad-
juvant setting. The further development of immunother-
apy in patients with RCC will provide meaningful benefit,
and the goal should be durable CRs comparable to those
observed with HD IL-2. Recent data showing substantial
3–5 year survival rates with nivolumab suggest that this
goal may quickly become a reality.
