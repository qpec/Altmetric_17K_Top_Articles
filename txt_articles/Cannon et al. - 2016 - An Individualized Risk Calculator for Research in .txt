Abstract
Objective—About 20–35% of individuals aged 12–30 years who meet criteria for a prodromal 
risk syndrome convert to psychosis within two years. However, this estimate ignores the fact that 
clinical high-risk (CHR) cases vary considerably in risk. Here we sought to create a risk calculator 
that can ascertain the probability of conversion to psychosis in individual patients based on

 profiles of risk indicators. The high risk category predicted by this calculator can inform research 
criteria going forward.
Method—Subjects were 596 CHR participants from the second phase of the North American 
Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS 2) who were followed up to the time of conversion to 
psychosis or last contact (up to 2 years). Our scope was limited to predictors supported by prior 
studies and readily obtainable in general clinical settings. Time-to-event regression was used to 
build a multivariate model predicting conversion, with internal validation using 1000 bootstrap 
resamples.
Results—The 2-year probability of conversion to psychosis in this sample was 16%. Higher 
levels of unusual thought content and suspiciousness, greater decline in social functioning, lower 
verbal learning and memory performance, slower speed of processing, and younger age at baseline 
each contributed to individual risk for psychosis, while stressful life events, traumas, and family 
history of schizophrenia were not significant predictors. The multivariate model achieved a 
Concordance index of 0.71, and was validated in an independent external dataset. The results are 
instantiated in a web-based risk prediction tool envisioned to be most useful in research protocols 
involving the psychosis prodrome.
Conclusions—A risk calculator comparable in accuracy to those for cardiovascular disease and 
cancer is available to predict individualized conversion risks in newly ascertained CHR cases. 
Given that the risk calculator can only be validly applied for patients who screen positive on the 
Structured Clinical Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes, which requires training to administer, 
it's most immediate uses will be in research on psychosis risk factors and in research driven 
clinical (prevention) trials.
Introduction
Given limitations of current treatments for schizophrenia, with most patients showing 
substantial deficits in social and occupational functioning throughout life, there is 
considerable interest in developing preventive approaches to psychotic disorders (1). 
Ascertainment of individuals at greatest risk is crucial to these efforts. For the majority of 
patients, onset of fully psychotic symptoms is preceded by the emergence of subtler changes 
in belief, thought, and perception that appear to represent attenuated forms of delusions, 
formal thought disorder, and hallucinations, respectively. Among individuals aged 12 to 35 
years with a recent onset of such symptoms (termed clinical high-risk or CHR cases), 
approximately 20–35% develop fully psychotic symptoms over a 2-year period, an incidence 
rate that is over 100 times larger than in the same age band in the general population (2). 
Further, it appears that the CHR criteria are sensitive to an imminent risk for onset, as most 
of the conversions occur during the first year following ascertainment, with a decelerating 
conversion rate thereafter (3).
Although CHR criteria have been validated as sensitive to conversion risk in epidemiological 
studies, their utility in individual decision-making is currently limited, given that two-thirds 
to four-fifths of cases ascertained by these methods do not convert to psychosis within a 2-
year time frame. A number of studies have examined combinations of clinical and 
demographic variables to determine whether prediction of psychosis can be enhanced

 beyond the 20–35% risk associated with CHR status (4). Multivariate algorithms requiring 
particular combinations of symptoms and demographic factors achieve relatively high 
positive predictive values and specificity (e.g., in the 50–70% range), but low sensitivity 
(e.g., in the 10–30% range) (3). There is consistency among studies in showing 
(unsurprisingly) that greater severity of the psychosis-risk symptoms at baseline is the best 
predictor of conversion; nevertheless, the most predictive multivariate profiles vary across 
studies (4). Although it should be noted that few studies have attempted direct replication of 
each other’s risk algorithms, this pattern suggests heterogeneity among profiles of clinical 
and demographic risk indicators among those who convert.
To maximize clinical utility, we require an approach that can be applied to scale the risk in 
an individual patient during their initial clinical contact. Such individualized risk calculation 
is possible when a large dataset on a reference population is available from which risks can 
be calculated based on one or more predictor variables. Well-performing risk calculators 
have been developed in numerous somatic disease contexts, including cardiovascular disease 
and cancer (5–9), where they provide a rationale for clinicians to pursue more or less 
invasive intervention strategies, based on the level of risk implied by an individual’s profile 
across a set of risk factors. They also inform patients and their family members to help make 
complex treatment decisions.
Here we present such an individualized risk calculator for psychosis, using data from the 
second phase of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS 2). Predictors 
were chosen a priori based on a review of the prior literature on psychosis risk prediction in 
CHR samples, blindly with respect to the empirical relationships between any of the 
nominated variables and psychosis outcome within the NAPLS 2 dataset. We limited our 
scope to clinical, cognitive, and demographic measures that are readily obtainable in 
standard clinical settings. Using time-to-event proportional hazards regression, a risk 
calculator was generated that calculates risk according to an individual subject’s values on 
the included variables. We evaluated the performance of the risk calculator using the 
Concordance index (a measure of overall accuracy, analogous to area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve or AUC) and assessed the relative importance of each of the 
included predictor variables.
Methods
Subjects and Clinical Characterization
The study protocol and consent form were reviewed and approved by the Institutional 
Review Boards at each of the 8 data collection sites (UCLA, Emory, Beth Israel Deaconess 
Medical Center, Zucker Hillside Hospital, UNC, UCSD, Calgary, Yale). We have previously 
reported on the methods for evaluation of subjects and data collection (10). Participants were 
evaluated using the Structured Interview for Psychosis-risk Syndromes (SIPS) (11) and the 
Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Version IV (DSM-IV) (12) by trained interviewers who met high reliability 
standards (ICCs=0.92–0.96) (10). Potential participants who had ever met DSM-IV criteria 
for a psychotic disorder or with histories of substance dependence, neurological disorder, or 
estimated IQ < 70 were excluded. Participants met SIPS criteria (13) for the presence of one

 or more CHR syndromes: attenuated psychotic symptoms syndrome; brief intermittent 
psychotic symptom syndrome; and/or familial risk and deterioration syndrome.
Follow-up clinical evaluations were scheduled every 6 months following study entry through 
2 years. Conversion to psychosis was determined by the SIPS criteria that are designed to 
operationalize the threshold of delusional ideation or hallucination severity required for a 
DSM-IV (14) psychotic disorder diagnosis. Participants were followed up to the time of 
conversion to psychosis or the last contact (up to 2 years), the dates for which were 
recorded, permitting calculation of length of time in the study until conversion or censoring 
(loss to follow-up).
A total of 743 SIPS-criteria meeting CHR cases were enrolled in NAPLS 2 from 2008 – 
2013. For the present report, we excluded subjects who dropped from the study before any 
clinical follow-up was conducted (N=147). The final study cohort consisted of 596 CHR 
participants with at least one follow-up evaluation.
Selection of Predictor Variables
To meet the objective of developing a practical tool for risk prediction, our focus was on 
demographic, clinical, neurocognitive and functioning measures that are easily administered 
in general clinical settings. The maximum number of predictors was limited a priori to 8 to 
ensure that there were at minimum 10 converters per predictor in the model, which helps to 
mitigate model instability due to over-fitting. We avoided including terms for the 
interactions among the predictors for this same reason. The NAPLS 2 dataset itself was not 
used to select predictors; doing so would have invalidated the logic of using the underlying 
data to inform prediction for new cases (i.e., the predictive logic would then be circular). 
Rather, we evaluated the available published literature on psychosis prediction in CHR 
samples. Our selection of indicators was based on empirical links to psychosis prediction in 
two or more prior studies of CHR cases; there was no attempt to select predictors based on a 
theoretical model of causes of psychosis or clinical knowledge or intuition. Based on this 
process, the following 8 variables were chosen for inclusion:
Age at ascertainment was included to help account for variation in age at onset of psychosis 
(15) and in processes that undergo developmental modification during the age range of our 
sample (16–18). Greater severity of SIPS items P1 and P2 (Unusual Thought Content and 
Suspiciousness) are strongly predictive of psychosis in CHR samples (3, 4). Given that the 
meaning of gradations below the prodromal threshold are likely different from those at or 
above this threshold, these items were modified such that all levels in the non-prodromal 
range (0–2 on the original scale) were redefined as 0, levels in the prodromal range (3–5 on 
original scale) were redefined as 1–3, and psychotic intensity (6 on original scale) was 
redefined as 4, and summed together. A number of studies have found that slower processing 
speed and lower verbal learning and memory functioning are predictive of psychosis (19, 20) 
and in meta-analyses, have among the largest effect sizes amongst converters to psychosis 
(21). These constructs were represented by scores on the BACS Symbol-Coding Test (22) 
and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R; sum of trials 1–3) (23), 
respectively. Many CHR cases who convert to psychosis show a pronounced decline in 
social functioning in the year prior to ascertainment (24), measured here using the Global

 Scale of Functioning-Social (GFS-S) (25). Stressful life events, along with childhood 
traumas, have been shown to be predictive of psychosis in prior studies of CHR samples 
(26). To represent the former, we aggregated 31 life events designated as negative and 
potentially relevant to subjects aged 12–35 years from the Research Interview Life Events 
Scale (RILES) (27), and for the latter, we used the Childhood Trauma and Abuse Scale 
(CTAS) (28). Family history of psychotic disorder in a first-degree relative is by itself not a 
robust predictor of psychosis in studies of CHR samples (3, 4), but was nevertheless 
included as it elevates ones’ risk by almost 10-fold compared with the general population 
(29).
Statistical methods
Risk calculators have been developed to assist health care professionals for a variety of 
illnesses (5–9) (see http://www.lerner.ccf.org/qhs/risk_calculator/ for examples). Calculators 
are able to derive a risk prediction for a particular person from a given set of indicators by 
querying a multivariate model based on a large sample of similar cases. Through imputation, 
calculators can accommodate incomplete information on the panel of risk indicators; 
however, they become more powerful, with a tighter range of certainty, the more complete 
the information available on a given case.
We built a multivariate proportional hazards (PH) model to predict the likelihood of 
conversion to psychosis based on each participant’s demographic, cognitive, and clinical 
characteristics, as defined above. We tested restricted cubic splines in relation to continuous 
variables; as none were significant, no adjustments were made. As shown in Table 1, there 
were no (or minimal) missing data for age, symptom severity, family history, and social 
functioning. Cognitive test data were missing on fewer than 4% of cases, and data regarding 
stressful life events and/or traumas were missing in 12–14% of cases. In order to reduce 
selection bias and maximize the sample size, missing predictors were multiply imputed with 
the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) method before the multivariate 
regression.
The statistical model was internally validated using 1000 bootstrap resamples, where the 
discrimination and calibration performance were evaluated. Harrell’s C-index was used to 
quantify the discrimination ability for separating converters and non-converters, which is 
analogous to the AUC, with a range of 0.5 (no discrimination) to 1 (perfect discrimination), 
but tailored for censored data (30). A plot of the model-predicted probabilities versus the 
observed outcomes was used to assess calibration performance.
All statistical analyses and graphics were conducted using the open source software R 
version 3.0.1 (R Core Team, 2013) including the rms and Hmisc packages.
Results
The baseline patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. There were no significant 
differences between those who were and were not followed up clinically on any of the 
predictor variables. Of the 596 participants with follow-up data available, 84 converted to 
psychosis within two years. The mean age of the sample was 18.5 years. Among converters,

 the mean time from baseline to conversion was 7.3 months, and among non-converters, the 
mean follow-up time from baseline to the last contact was 19.1 months. A total of 280 cases 
were followed up at 24 months without converting, and the remaining “non-converters” were 
lost to follow-up at various points between 6 and 24-months.
The 2-year probability of conversion to psychosis was 0.16 (95%CI 0.13, 0.19). Figure 1 
provides frequency distributions of predicted risks in the sample overall and among 
converters. Converters are identified at a higher rate than the sample base-rate beginning at a 
predicted risk of .20 or higher. The output of the multivariate PH model is shown in Table 2. 
Prodromal symptom severity (P1P2), decline in social functioning, and verbal learning and 
memory (HVLT-R scores) were significant predictors, with non-significant trends for age at 
baseline and speed of processing (Symbol-Coding score) (p’s < 0.10), though all of these 
variables were significant in univariate analyses (p’s < 0.01). Stressful life events, traumas, 
and family history of schizophrenia were not significant predictors in univariate or 
multivariate analyses.
Table 2 provides additional diagnostics of the performance of individual predictor variables. 
Predictors associated with the largest decreases in the C-index when removed from the 
model were P1P2, decline in global social functioning, HVLT-R score, and Symbol-Coding 
score. Predictors associated with the largest increases in the C-index (i.e., above that of the 
base model that included only P1P2) were Symbol-Coding score, HVLT-R score, decline in 
social functioning, and age. Family history of psychosis, stressful life events, and traumas 
did not alter the C-index by more than one-half of one percent when added to or deleted 
from the model.
Based on the bootstrap internal validation, the multivariate model achieved a C-index of 
0.71. As shown in Figure 2, the calibration plot revealed a high degree of consistency 
between observed probabilities and model-predicted probabilities of conversion to psychosis 
within the range of 0.0–0.4, within which 95% of the cases fell (mean = 0.18, SD = 0.11; 
median = 0.16). Table 3 gives statistics for prediction of actual conversion to psychosis 
across several thresholds of model-predicted risk. There is a trade-off between the positive 
predictive value (PPV; proportion of cases at the threshold of predicted risk who actually 
converted) versus sensitivity (proportion of actual converters who had predicted risks at that 
threshold). PPV is maximal (48.4%) at a threshold of 0.4 or higher of model-predicted risk, 
but only 17.9% of converters have model-predicted risks at this threshold. Conversely, at a 
model-predicted risk of 0.2 or higher, PPV is 28.1%, but with a sensitivity of 66.7%.
An on-line version of the risk calculator was built to facilitate numeric calculation of the 
predicted probability of conversion to psychosis (http://riskcalc.org:3838/napls/).
Discussion
The goal of this study was to develop a practical tool for the individualized prediction of 
psychosis in CHR cases. A well-performing risk calculator was generated from the NAPLS 
2 cohort using a small number of demographic (age, family history of psychosis), clinical 
(unusual thought content and suspiciousness), neurocognitive (speed of processing, verbal

 learning and memory), and psychosocial (traumas, stressful life events, decline in social 
functioning) predictor variables. The overall model achieved a C-index of 0.71, which is in 
the range of those of established calculators currently in use for cardiovascular disease and 
cancer recurrence risk, with C-indices of 0.58 to 0.81 (5–9).
The risk calculator generates a number representing the probability of transition to psychosis 
given a particular profile of input variables. Technically, this is an observed likelihood of 
conversion within the NAPLS 2 cohort itself, but this framework uses the logic of predictive 
inference to extend that observed likelihood based on past cases to the predicted probability 
for a newly ascertained case with the same profile. This logic rests on the assumption that 
the new case is ascertained from the same population and in a manner similar as those in 
NAPLS 2.
In particular, given that this risk calculator assumes a SIPS-based diagnosis of a prodromal 
risk syndrome as a starting point, the risk prediction tool would not be usable if such a risk 
syndrome has not been diagnosed. The risk calculator also assumes particular pathways to 
ascertainment, in that CHR cases in NAPLS are distressed and treatment seeking. This tool 
would thus be most useful to clinicians with training in psychosis risk detection using the 
SIPS (which, in addition to risk status, ascertains severity of unusual thought content and 
suspiciousness and family history of psychosis), who could then use the calculator for 
patients who have screened positive for a prodromal risk syndrome. Critically, risk 
determinations should be communicated to clients by trained clinicians, who can help clients 
understand the meaning of the risk estimates (i.e., calibrated to the sample from which they 
were generated) and provide commensurate treatment recommendations. Note that, within 
the context of NAPLS 2, with a mean±SD predicted risk of 0.18±0.11, predicted risks of .3 
or higher are relatively rare (12.4% prevalence among those meeting CHR criteria) and 
potent (39.2% PPV). Proper training in the administration and scoring of the other measures 
included in the risk calculator (i.e., Symbol-Coding, HVLT-R, GSF-S, RILES, CTAS) is also 
required.
A key advantage of the risk calculator is that it inherently accommodates heterogeneity in 
profiles of risk factors among CHR cases. Examining configurations that vary across the 
significant predictors – greater prodromal symptom severity, lower verbal learning and 
memory, slower speed of processing, greater decline social functioning, and younger age – 
reveals that a number of separate permutations yield predicted conversion risks of 0.3 or 
higher. Stressful life events, traumas and family history of schizophrenia have a negligible 
impact on their own or in combinations with other variables in prediction of psychosis, but 
did occur more frequently among CHR individuals compared to healthy controls. Perhaps 
these variables are more significant for determining presence of a CHR syndrome and thus 
are not as sensitive to outcomes within a group all of whom have a CHR syndrome.
The most crucial test of robustness of a statistical model is validation on an independent, 
external dataset. In a companion paper (31), Carrión et al. perform such a replication test of 
the NAPLS 2 risk calculator in an independent sample from the Early Detection, 
Intervention, and Prevention of Psychosis Program (EDIPPP) that included 176 CHR cases 
diagnosed using the SIPS and followed clinically to monitor conversion. Only the stress and

 trauma variables – found to be negligible in predicting conversion here – were not collected 
and were therefore omitted from the replication testing. The remaining 6 NAPLS 2 risk 
factors yielded a highly significant time-to-event proportional hazards regression model 
predicting conversion in the EDIPPP sample (p<0.003), with a C-index of 0.79, which is 
even somewhat better than in the NAPLS 2 sample (0.71). The predictive model was well 
calibrated, and the NAPLS 2 calculator provided a reasonable estimation of psychosis risk 
when considering the risk prediction generated by the validation model and the actual 
observed outcomes. In addition, when applied to the external EDIPPP sample, the NAPLS 2 
calculator showed sensitivity and specificity values comparable to those found in the NAPLS 
2 sample across different levels of model predicted risk (i.e., as in Table 3) (31).
There is also some degree of convergence with previous studies reporting multivariate 
models, but which used their own samples for variable selection (i.e., model optimization) 
and did not present a web-based tool for extending individualized risk estimation to future 
patients (3, 24, 32). For example, a recent report (24) using a smaller (N=92) and non-
overlapping sample of CHR cases from one of the NAPLS sites developed a classifier that 
included three of predictors included in the NAPLS 2 risk calculator (suspiciousness, verbal 
memory deficits, and decline in social functioning). Note that the sample in that study was 
over 5 times smaller, used a more restricted age range (12–20), and was not ascertained 
using SIPS criteria, factors that make risk classifications based on it much less generalizable 
than that of the NAPLS 2 risk calculator.
The most immediate uses of the risk calculator are likely to be in the selection of individual 
subjects for participation in clinical (prevention) trials, given the desire to avoid exposing 
cases with lower transition risks to the potential adverse consequences of any interventions 
and given the potential to evaluate whether interventions differ in effectiveness based on 
initial risk levels and/or profiles across predictors. In terms of clinical practice outside the 
context of a prevention trial, at this point the most likely use is for the clinician to be able to 
communicate to the patient and family a scaling of risk that could help to recruit their 
cooperation with a monitoring and/or intervention plan.
A current limitation of the psychosis risk calculator is that risk estimates are not bounded by 
a confidence interval, making it unclear how well the single value output as a conversion risk 
represents the individual’s actual likelihood of conversion. This issue is particularly 
problematic for computed risks of 0.5 or higher, for which there is sparse representation 
within the NAPLS 2 dataset and for which calibration of the risk calculator could 
consequently not be adequately tested. Nevertheless, the use of confidence intervals is not 
likely to be of value in discussing risks with individual patients and their families, as the 
general concept of a confidence interval relates to likelihoods under future sampling rather 
than to an individual case, and the calculated risk is the best estimate for that individual (33).
Because the replication study (EDIPPP) included several community behavioral health 
centers and inter-governmental managed mental health organizations, the risk calculator 
appears to be generalizable beyond academic medical centers, at least within the United 
States health care system. The degree to which the risk calculator generalizes to other health 
care system models (e.g., socialized) remains an open question.

 In addition to testing the calculator’s performance in independent datasets, future work 
could determine whether other variables, including biological tests, can improve prediction 
over and above the set of clinical, demographic and cognitive measures evaluated here. 
Some promising leads on the use of biological assays to predict psychosis among CHR cases 
have emerged using empirically-based discovery approaches, including machine learning 
algorithms for gray matter variations in structural brain images (34) and so-called “greedy” 
regression algorithms for proteomic/metabolic plasma parameters (35). Future studies 
employing discovery oriented model-optimization methods, with parallel, independent 
samples, are needed to better inform future versions of this and other risk calculators. 
However, it is still critical to note that the data used in any risk calculator could not be the 
same as used in the model optimization phase; as noted above, doing so would invalidate the 
risk predictions for new cases.
Given that in approximately one-third of CHR cases, the symptoms that determined their 
initial risk status remit within 6- to 12-months of ascertainment (36, 37), it should be 
possible to develop a complementary tool to predict a new case's likelihood of remission 
from a CHR syndrome. Such an estimate would not necessarily be merely the inverse of the 
conversion risk, as different predictors may be relevant.
It is also possible that risk calculators could eventually be used to select clients for different 
treatment regimens or reclassify risk following completion of a particular intervention. At 
this stage, the knowledge base for doing so is quite limited, as only a small number of 
controlled prevention trials in CHR cases have appeared. Collectively, the results support the 
view that any targeted intervention, whether biological or psychological in approach, is 
associated with better outcomes than less targeted control conditions (38). Results of two 
small trials with antipsychotic drugs do not support a prophylactic effect on conversion risk 
beyond the period of active treatment (39, 40). In general, the use of such medicines in 
individuals who are below the threshold of full psychosis is not recommended. Intriguing 
results have been obtained in an initial trial of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (41); this 
finding awaits confirmation by independent studies. Psychosocial interventions such as 
cognitive behavior therapy and family-focused psychoeducation may be beneficial in 
deflecting the course of illness severity and chronicity (42, 43); however, it remains unclear 
whether such approaches can prevent onset of illness. Future intervention studies are 
encouraged to use the risk calculator at end-stage analysis to determine whether treatment 
efficacy is moderated by initial risk level or profile.
Ultimately, the degree of risk estimated by the risk calculator may be useful for weighing the 
cost-benefit ratios of various treatment options that emerge from clinical intervention 
research in the CHR population. Treatments associated with greater risks to the patient (e.g., 
medication side effects) or greater costs to healthcare delivery systems (e.g., resource and 
time intensive psychotherapeutic inventions) may best be reserved for those with higher-
than-median levels of predicted risk (i.e., ≥0.16), while cost-effective treatments with benign 
side effect profiles may be the best option for those whose predicted risk for psychosis is in 
the lower range.

 Like a person at risk for cardiovascular disease or cancer, an individual with a prodromal 
risk syndrome is more interested in receiving information pertinent to his or her personal 
risk profile than information about the population at large. Publication of this risk calculator 
is intended to assist clinicians in providing such personalized risk estimates. It is of course 
possible for an untrained individual to access these tools and approximate their scores on the 
set of risk variables. If, in so doing, a high predicted risk of conversion was generated, this 
could lead to significant personal distress. To mitigate this possibility, we have built in a 
decision-tree for the on-line calculator that requires confirmation of an interview-based SIPS 
diagnosis of a prodromal risk syndrome and confirmation that the ratings and test scores 
were obtained by a professional; if either one of these verifications are missing, the decision 
tree opts out of making a prediction. The risk for loss of privacy or stigmatization based on 
access of the prediction tool by untrained users is also mitigated for these reasons.
In summary, a well-performing risk calculator for psychosis is available for application to 
new patients who meet criteria for a psychosis risk syndrome. Challenges to be addressed in 
the next phase of research include incorporating biological assays into the risk calculations, 
extending the analysis to predict likelihood of remission, extending the framework to 
calculate reductions in risk based on particular interventions and investigating how patients 
and family members feel about and use this information.

 Figure 2. 
Calibration plot of the accuracy of model-predicted probability in relation to observed 
probability of psychosis. The observed probability was estimated using proportional hazard 
regression evaluating the predicted 2-year probabilities in relation to the observed 
conversion events, taking into account time to conversion or censoring. The over-fitting bias 
for the estimated observed probability was corrected using 1000 bootstrap resamples. The 
plot shows excellent calibration across predicted probabilities of 0.0 – 0.4, corresponding to 
95% of the NAPLS 2 sample. Predicted probabilities above 0.4 are too sparsely represented 
to permit adequate calibration testing.
