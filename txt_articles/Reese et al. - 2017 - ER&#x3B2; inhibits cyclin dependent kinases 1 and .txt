ABSTRACT
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which comprises approximately 15% of 
all primary breast cancer diagnoses, lacks estrogen receptor alpha, progesterone 
receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression. However, we, 
and others, have demonstrated that approximately 30% of TNBCs express estrogen 
receptor beta (ERβ), a nuclear hormone receptor and potential drug target. Treatment 
of ERβ expressing MDA-MB-231 cells with estrogen or the ERβ selective agonist, 
LY500307, was shown to result in suppression of cell proliferation. This inhibitory 
effect was due to blockade of cell cycle progression. In vivo, estrogen treatment 
significantly repressed the growth of ERβ expressing MDA-MB-231 cell line xenografts. 
Gene expression studies and ingenuity pathway analysis identified a network of ERβ 
down-regulated genes involved in cell cycle progression including CDK1, cyclin B and 
cyclin H. siRNA mediated knockdown or drug inhibition of CDK1 and CDK7 in TNBC 
cells resulted in substantial decreases in proliferation regardless of ERβ expression. 
These data suggest that the tumor suppressive effects of ERβ in TNBC result from 
inhibition of cell cycle progression, effects that are in part mediated by suppression of 
CDK1/7. Furthermore, these data indicate that blockade of CDK1/7 activity in TNBC 
may be of therapeutic benefit, an area of study that has yet to be explored. 
INTRODUCTION
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 
approximately 15% of all breast cancers diagnosed [1, 2] 
and is defined by the absence of estrogen receptor alpha 
(ERα), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification [1, 2]. 
TNBC typically occurs in young, pre-menopausal women 
and is more prevalent in women of African-American 
decent [3]. Women diagnosed with TNBC usually present 
with larger tumors of higher grade that have spread to 
the lymph nodes [4]. Despite current treatment strategies 
which include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation 
therapy, patients with TN disease are faced with a 
poor prognosis [5]. In fact, 34% of patients with newly 
diagnosed TNBC will develop recurrent disease within 
five years of diagnosis following aggressive chemotherapy 
treatment [5]. Therefore, a better understanding of the 
molecular pathways responsible for driving TNBC 
development and progression, and the concurrent 
identification of novel therapeutic drug targets, are vital 
steps to combatting this breast cancer subtype.
We have previously demonstrated that a second 
form of the estrogen receptor, ERβ, is expressed in 
approximately 30% of TNBCs [6] and have shown that

proliferation of ERβ+ TNBC cell lines is significantly 
inhibited following estrogen treatment [6-8]. A recent 
meta-analysis of ERβ expression in breast cancer 
showed significant associations with increased disease-
free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in ERα-
negative patients [9]. These data support the notion that 
drugs designed to specifically activate ERβ may elicit 
therapeutic benefit in the portion of TNBC patients with 
ERβ+ disease.
Past studies have suggested that one of the 
mechanisms by which ERβ functions as a tumor 
suppressor in breast cancer is through alterations in cell 
cycle progression [8, 10, 11]. Cell division is a well-
orchestrated process that requires coordinated expression 
of key factors during specific points in the cell cycle in 
order to be successful. These factors include cyclin-
dependent kinases (CDKs) which are heterodimeric serine/
threonine kinases that depend on cyclins, their binding 
partners, for catalytic activity [12, 13]. In humans, there 
are 21 CDK genes [14] which are known to be positive 
regulators of cell proliferation, gene transcription and 
mRNA processing [15, 16]. 
Abnormal activation of CDKs results in increased 
proliferation of cancer cells and genomic instability [17]. 
For these reasons, inhibition of CDK activity has received 
significant attention as a therapeutic approach to treat 
multiple forms of cancer. In breast cancer, CDK4 and 
CDK6 are among the most well studied CDKs. CDK4 and 
6 interact with cyclin D to drive cell cycle progression 
from G0 to early G1 phase [18]. Palbociclib, an inhibitor 
of CDK4 and CDK6, in combination with endocrine 
therapy resulted in improved progression-free survival 
(PFS) in ERα+/Her2 negative advanced breast cancer 
[19-21]. Unfortunately, palbociclib does not inhibit 
proliferation in TNBC cell lines [19, 22] although a 
recent study has demonstrated that blockade of CDK4/6 
suppresses TNBC metastases [23]. 
In the current study, we demonstrate that treatment 
of ERβ expressing TNBC cells with estrogen, or the ERβ 
selective agonist, LY500307, results in suppression of 
proliferation through blockade of cell cycle progression. 
Furthermore, activation of ERβ was shown to significantly 
inhibit the growth of MDA-MB-231 cell line xenografts 
in vivo. From a mechanistic standpoint, ligand-mediated 
activation of ERβ results in the suppression of a network 
of genes involved in cell cycle progression including 
CDK1, CDK7, cyclin B and cyclin H. siRNA-mediated 
depletion, or drug inhibition of CDK1 and CDK7 resulted 
in substantial decreases in TNBC cell proliferation, effects 
that were independent of ERβ expression. Taken together, 
these data suggest that the tumor suppressive effects of 
ERβ in TNBC are in part mediated by inhibition of genes 
involved in cell cycle progression and provide further 
support for the development of CDK1 and CDK7 specific 
inhibitors for the treatment of TNBC. 
RESULTS
The selective ERβ agonist, LY500307, inhibits 
TNBC cellular proliferation
We, and others, have shown that approximately 
30% of all TNBCs express ERβ [6, 24] and that estrogen 
treatment of ERβ expressing TNBC cell lines results in 
decreased proliferation rates [6, 7]. Using a doxycycline 
(Dox)-inducible ERβ expressing MDA-MB-231 cell 
line generated in our laboratory, we have confirmed that 
ligand mediated transcriptional activation of ERβ with

either estrogen or multiple doses of the highly selective 
ERβ agonist, LY500307, (Figure 1A) results in significant 
inhibition of TNBC cell proliferation following five days 
of treatment (Figure 1B). All concentrations of LY500307 
used in this study resulted in significant repression of 
cell proliferation relative to vehicle control treated cells, 
effects that were nearly identical to that of 1 nM estrogen 
treatment.

ERβ activation does not induce apoptosis
Given the observed decreases in TNBC cell 
proliferation following estrogen and ERβ selective 
agonist treatment, we next sought to determine if these 
compounds induced programmed cell death. Using 
an antibody based array, we analyzed the impact of 24 
hours of estrogen treatment on the expression levels of 
35 different apoptosis-related proteins in MDA-MB-231-
ERβ cells. The expression levels of classic pro-apoptotic 
proteins such as cytochrome C, pro-caspase 3, and FADD 
did not significantly change with treatment, nor did a 
number of anti-apoptotic proteins such as XIAP, HIF-1α 
and cIAP (Figure 2A and 2B). Furthermore, Annexin V 
staining followed by flow cytometry did not indicate any 
induction of apoptosis following estrogen or LY500307 
treatment for 24 hours or 5 days (Figure 2C and 2D). 
Instead, a decrease in the percentage of apoptotic cells 
(as indicated by the number of cells in the upper-right 
quadrant of the scatterplot) was observed following 
induction of ERβ expression, an effect that was further 
magnified in the setting of ligand treatment (Figure 2C 
and 2D). These data indicate that ERβ-mediated decreases 
in TNBC cell proliferation are not due to the induction of 
programed cell death. 
Ligand mediated activation of ERβ induces cell 
cycle arrest
Based on the above findings, we next assessed 
the impact of estrogen and LY500307 on cell cycle 
progression. Following 24 hours or 5 days of treatment 
with estrogen or LY500307, propidium iodide (PI) 
staining followed by flow cytometry analysis revealed 
a statistically significant accumulation of cells in the 
G1 phase of the cell cycle compared to vehicle-treated 
controls (Figure 3A and 3B). These data indicate that the 
tumor suppressive effects of ERβ in TNBC cells primarily 
result from the induction of cell cycle arrest.
Estrogen suppresses ERβ positive TNBC tumor 
growth in vivo
Given these in vitro findings, we next examined 
the effect of ERβ activation on MDA-MB-231 tumor 
growth in vivo. One million MDA-MB-231-ERβ-Luc 
cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank 
of 6-8 week old ovariectomized female nude mice and 
tumors were allowed to form and progress to a tumor 
volume of approximately 100 mm3. Following tumor 
establishment, animals were placed on doxycycline-
containing chow and randomized to placebo or estrogen

pellets. Tumor volume was determined weekly using 
calipers and luciferase readouts were captured using the 
IVIS2000 xenogen machine after 8 weeks of treatment 
(Figure 4A and 4B). Animal weights were also measured 
weekly as a means of monitoring toxicities and no changes 
were observed during the course of the study. Estrogen 
treatment resulted in suppression of tumor progression 
as indicated by a significantly increased time to tumor 
doubling compared to placebo treated control animals 
(Figure 4C). Time to tumor tripling was also significantly 
increased in estrogen treated mice (data not shown). To 
confirm that ERβ expression was maintained throughout 
the course of the experiment, both mRNA and protein 
levels were determined in residual tumors at the time of 
sacrifice by RT-PCR and western blotting (Figure 4D 
and 4E). ERβ protein expression was also monitored by 
immunohistochemistry in tumor sections (Figure 4F). All 
of these analyses demonstrated that ERβ expression was 
maintained and indicated that estrogen treatment may 
stabilize ERβ protein levels in vivo. 
ERβ suppresses a network of genes pertaining to 
CDK1 and CDK7 function
To determine the mechanisms by which activation 
of ERβ may elicit its tumor suppressive effects, we 
interrogated transcriptomic data collected from vehicle 
and estrogen treated MDA-MB-231-ERβ cells that were 
generated in our laboratory (data not shown). Ingenuity 
pathway analysis of estrogen regulated genes identified 
cell cycle regulation as one of the most significantly 
regulated networks (Figure 5A). A heat map depicting the 
estrogen-regulated genes identified within this network is 
shown in Figure 5B and indicates that the majority of these 
genes are suppressed in response to estrogen. A number 
of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their respective 
binding partners were down-regulated including CDK1 
(cdc2), cyclin B and cyclin H, while a number of keratins 
were upregulated. The down-regulation of these targets 
was confirmed with qPCR analysis (Figure 5C). Decreased

protein levels of CDK1, the active form of CDK1 
(phospho-CDK1) and cyclin B1 were also observed in 
response to both estrogen and LY500307 treatment in ERβ 
expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5D). Furthermore, 
we confirmed that the expression of CDK1, cyclin B, 
and cyclin H were decreased in the MDA-MB-231-ERβ 
xenograft tumors isolated from estrogen treated animals 
relative to placebo treated controls (Figure 5E). These data 
demonstrate that a number of important cell cycle-related 
genes are repressed by estrogen and LY500307 treatment 
in ERβ expressing TNBC cells.

Inhibition of CDK1 and CDK7 suppresses TNBC 
cell proliferation
Since estrogen and LY500307 resulted in decreased 
expression of CDK1 and CDK7, we sought to further 
analyze the roles of these two proteins in regulating cell 
proliferation and cell cycle progression in TNBC cells. As 
a first step, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of 
CDK1 and CDK7 in MDA-MB-231 cells. A pool of CDK1 
or CDK7 siRNAs was shown to substantially decrease the 
mRNA (Figure 6A and 6C) and protein levels (Figure 6B 
and 6D) for each of these genes. Interestingly, knockdown 
of CDK7 also resulted in decreased expression of its 
binding partner, cyclin H, as well as the phosphorylation 
of serine 5 at the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase 
II (Figure 6D). siRNA-mediated suppression of CDK1 
and CDK7 also resulted in significant decreases in 
the proliferation rates of MDA-MB-231 cells, effects 
that were independent of the presence or absence of 
ERβ expression (Figure 6E). To confirm these effects, 
dose-response curves were generated using the CDK1 
inhibitor, dinaciclib (Figure 6F), and the CDK7 inhibitor, 
BS-181 (Figure 6G). Proliferation assays revealed potent 
inhibition of MDA-MB-231 proliferation rates by both 
drugs in ERβ+ (dox) and ERβ- (no dox) cell lines after 
six days. As seen with siRNA knockdown, drug inhibition 
of CDK7 with BS-181 at or above the IC50, also showed 
altered protein levels of total RNA polymerase II and RNA 
polymerase II phospho-serine 5 (Figure 6H). These data 
demonstrate that knockdown, or drug-mediated inhibition, 
of CDK1 and CDK7 results in decreased proliferation in 
TNBC cells regardless of ERβ expression. In addition, 
CDK7 inhibition also has an effect on the phosphorylation 
of RNA polymerase II and therefore might play a dual role 
in cell cycle progression and transcription.
Impact of CDK1 and CDK7 inhibition on TNBC 
cell cycle progression
To further elucidate the roles of CDK1 and CDK7 
in modulating TNBC cell proliferation, we next analyzed 
the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of these two 
genes on cell cycle progression. As shown in Figure 7, 
knockdown of CDK1 resulted in a dramatic accumulation 
of MDA-MB-231 cells in the G2-phase (45%) of the cell 
cycle relative to scrambled siRNA controls (Figure 7A and 
7B). Interestingly, knockdown of CDK7 did not have a 
significant effect on cell cycle progression (Figure 7A and 
7B) in spite of the fact that cell proliferation rates were 
decreased under these same conditions (Figure 6E). This 
effect could in part be due to CDK7’s role in transcription 
Figure 6: Inhibition of CDK1 and CDK7 decreases proliferation of TNBC cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK1 A. 
and B. and CDK7 C. and D. in MDA-MB-231-ERβ cells were verified at both the mRNA and protein level. The impact of CDK1 (B) 
and CDK7 (D) knockdown on the protein expression levels of their respective binding partners, cyclin B and cyclin H, as well as RNA 
Polymerase II phospho-serine 5 for siCDK7 treated cells, are shown. Total RNA Polymerase II and Vinculin are shown as loading controls.

where it is known to phosphorylate the C-terminal domain 
of RNA polymerase II at Serine 5 [25]. Drug mediated 
inhibition of CDK1 with dinaciclib also resulted in a G2 
arrest (Figure 7C and 7D) similar to that of the siRNA. 
Blockade of CDK7 with BS-181 had no significant effect 
on cell cycle progression (Figure 7C and 7D) as was also 
shown to be the case in CDK7 siRNA transfected cells. 
Overall these data demonstrate that suppression of CDK1 
results in a G2 phase cell cycle arrest while blockade of 
CDK7 function has no impact on cell cycle progression of 
TNBC cells. 
DISCUSSION
ERβ is a tumor suppressor whose expression is 
associated with a better prognosis in breast cancer [6, 
26-35]. As ERβ is expressed in approximately 30% of 
TNBCs we sought to determine the therapeutic potential 
of targeting ERβ in TNBC. In this manuscript, we 
demonstrate that ligand-mediated activation of ERβ with 
estrogen, or the ERβ selective agonist LY500307, resulted 
in anti-proliferative effects in vitro and suppression of 
tumor progression in vivo. Activation of ERβ was shown 
to induce cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis. ERβ was 
also shown to inhibit the expression of a number of cell 
cycle-related genes both in vitro and in vivo including 
CDK1, cyclin B, and cyclin H. siRNA and drug mediated 
inhibition of CDK1 resulted in decreased proliferation 
of MDA-MB-231 cells due to a G2/M phase cell cycle 
arrest, effects that were independent of ERβ expression. 
Inhibition of CDK7 using siRNA and BS-181 resulted in 
decreased proliferation of TNBC cells, but had no effect 
on cell cycle progression. 
In this manuscript, we report for the first time that 
low concentrations of LY500307, a potent ERβ selective 
agonist, can not only activate ERβ but also suppress 
proliferation of ERβ expressing TNBC cells. These anti-
proliferative effects are an extension of previous studies 
by our laboratory and others demonstrating that ligand-
mediated activation of ERβ results in anti-proliferative 
effects in multiple cancer cell lines [6-8, 36]. In addition, 
we showed that estrogen treatment of mice harboring 
ERβ+ MDA-MB-231 xenografts results in significant 
inhibition of tumor growth, and in some animals 
induced complete tumor regression. These findings are 
in agreement with a previous collaborative study with 
Dr. Wei Xu’s group in which estrogen treatment induced 
anti-tumor effects in ERβ expressing MDA-MB-468 
xenografts [8]. 
Previous findings from our laboratory have 
demonstrated that estrogen treatment of ERβ expressing 
Hs578T TNBC cells inhibits proliferation primarily by 
inducing a G1 cell cycle arrest [7]. We have confirmed

these observations in the present study using MDA-MB-
231-ERβ cells. In the MDA-MB-231-ERβ model, we also 
observed a slight, but insignificant, increase in G2 arrest. 
These findings agree with previous studies that have linked 
ligand-mediated activation of ERβ to both G1 and G2 cell 
cycle arrest in multiple types of cancer cell lines [10, 11, 
37-40]. In addition to cell cycle analysis, we performed 
an Annexin V/PI assay to determine if programmed-
cell death contributed to the observed decreased rates of 
proliferation. Interestingly, when ERβ is expressed, the 
basal number of cells undergoing apoptosis decreased 
compared to when ERβ is absent. These effects of ERβ 
on decreased rates of apoptosis have been observed 
previously and may be related to the decreased rates of 
cell growth [41]. These data indicated that alterations 
in apoptosis do not contribute to the tumor suppressive 
effects of ERβ in this model system and instead that the 
majority of this phenotype is driven by increases in cell 
cycle arrest. 
To understand the potential mechanisms of action 
by which ERβ suppresses cell cycle progression, we 
performed ingenuity pathway analysis on existing gene 
expression studies conducted by our laboratory. In this 
analysis, one of the most significantly altered biological 
pathways following estrogen treatment of MDA-MB-
231-ERβ cells was a network of genes involved in cell 
cycle regulation. Among these genes were CDK1, cyclin 
B and cyclin H which were all significantly suppressed by 
estrogen treatment. Unliganded ERβ has previously been 
shown to repress the expression of cyclin B1, which in 
turn decreases the activity of CDK1 and results in a G2 
cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells [10]. Another interesting 
observation was that a number of keratins were also 
upregulated. Keratins are known markers of differentiation 
that can be associated with histological grade, however, 
no observations of differential tumor histology were 
observed in the animal xenografts [42, 43]. To the best of 
our knowledge, our findings are the first to report that ERβ 
suppresses the functions of CDK1 and CDK7 (through 
suppression of cyclin H) in TNBC. 
Since CDK1 is required for mitosis, approaches 
to target the CDK1-cyclin B complex are appealing for 
cancer therapy. In fact, agents targeting CDK1 or cyclin 
B have been shown to effectively block tumor growth and 
progression of multiple forms of cancer [44-48]. While 
a pure CDK1 inhibitor does not yet exist, a number of 
pan-CDK inhibitors, including dinaciclib, have been 
developed [49, 50]. Dinacilib targets CDK1, CDK2, 
CDK5 and CDK9 with in vitro IC50 values of 3 nM 1 
nM, 1 nM and 4 nM, respectively. At the concentrations 
utilized in this study, dinaciclib would have an effect on 
all four of these CDKs. Our results demonstrated a potent 
G2/M cell cycle arrest indicative of CDK1 inhibition in 
TNBC cells and significantly decreased proliferation 
rate. These findings correlate well with other pre-clinical 
studies demonstrating inhibition of cell proliferation by 
siRNA mediated suppression or dinaciclib treatment in 
other types of cancer cell lines [22, 50-53]. Furthermore, 
clinical studies of dinaciclib have demonstrated efficacy 
in both solid tumors and relapsed multiple myeloma with 
a manageable safety profile [54, 55]. 
In addition to CDK1, we also demonstrated that 
CDK7 function is likely to be repressed given the 
decreased expression of cyclin H following estrogen 
treatment of ERβ expressing MDA-MB-231 cells and 
xenograft tumors. CDK7 knockdown was shown to 
decrease cyclin H protein levels, an effect that has also 
been observed in a previous report [56]. CDK7, unlike 
other CDKs, plays a dual role in regulating both cell 
cycle progression and transcription [57, 58]. In regard to 
cell cycle progression, inhibition of CDK7, specifically 
during the G2-phase of the cell cycle, prevents entry into 
mitosis by disrupting the assembly and phosphorylation 
of the CDK1-cyclin B complex [59]. On the other hand, 
CDK7 plays an important role in transcription where it 
phosphorylates serine 5 at the C-terminal domain of RNA 
polymerase II [58]. Here we demonstrate that knockdown 
or drug inhibition of CDK7 did indeed have an effect 
on the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II at serine 
5. In the present report, inhibition of CDK7 resulted in 
decreased proliferation of TNBC cells, which could be 
due to the transcriptional activity of CDK7 rather than 
its influence on cell cycle progression as no effect was 
observed. These findings are in agreement with a previous 
study demonstrating that some TNBC cells are “addicted” 
to CDK7 mediated transcription, and that suppression of 
CDK7 function elicits tumor suppressive effects [59]. 
In conclusion, these data indicate that ligand-
mediated activation of ERβ in TNBC cells results 
in decreased proliferation rates, cell cycle arrest and 
suppression of tumor growth. These effects are likely 
mediated in part by suppression of CDK1 and CDK7 
function. We provide further evidence that inhibition 
of CDK1 and CDK7 expression/function also results in 
decreased proliferation of TNBC cells, effects that are 
independent of ERβ expression or estrogen treatment. 
These findings support the notion that CDK1 and CDK7 
serve as clinically relevant therapeutic targets in TNBC, an 
area of study that has yet to be fully explored.

free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (AA), 5 
mg/L blasticidin S and 500 mg/L zeocin and cultured in

a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2. HyCloneTM 
charcoal/dextran stripped FBS (CS-FBS) was purchased 
from GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Pittsburgh, PA). For 
xenograft models, the MDA-MB-231-ERβ-Luc cell line 
was generated by stably integrating the pLNCX-FLuc 
(firefly luciferase) vector into the doxycycline-inducible 
ERβ1-expressing MDA-MB-231 cell line. MDA-MB-
231-ERβ-Luc cells were maintained in identical medium 
with the addition of 500 µg/L puromycin. 17β-estradiol 
(E2) and doxycycline (Dox) were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The ERβ-selective agonist, 
LY500307, was obtained from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). 
Dinaciclib (SCH727965) and BS-181 HCl were purchased 
from Selleckchem (Houston, TX).
Transient transfection and luciferase assay 
analysis
MDA-MB-231-ERβ cells were plated at 35,000 
cells/well in 24-well plates with 10% CS-FBS containing 
media supplemented with 100 ng/ml dox for 24 hours. 
Cells were transfected with 100 ng of the estrogen 
response element (ERE) luciferase reporter construct 
using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche) in CS-FBS 
containing media. The next day, cells were washed twice 
with 1X PBS and treated with CS-FBS containing media 
supplemented with 100 ng/ml Dox and ethanol control, 1 
nM estrogen, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 nM LY500307 for 24 
hours. Cells were harvested using 1X Passive Lysis Buffer 
(Promega, Madison, WI) and equal amounts of protein 
extract were assayed using luciferase assay reagent and a 
Glomax-Dual Luminometer (Promega).
Proliferation assays
Relative proliferation rates were determined 
using crystal violet assays. Briefly, cells were plated in 
replicates of eight at a density of 2,000 cells per well in 
96-well plates using 10% CS-FBS containing phenol-
red free medium in the presence (100 ng/mL) or absence 
of Dox as indicated. Twenty-four hours later, cells were 
treated with vehicle (ethanol), 1 nM E2, or various 
concentrations of LY500307, dinaciclib, BS-181 or 
siRNAs as indicated. After six days of treatment, cells 
were fixed with glutaraldehyde and stained with crystal 
violet. Staining was solubilized with 100 nM sodium 
citrate and quantified using a plate reader at wavelength 
550 nm. Replicates were averaged among treatment 
groups and values were normalized to vehicle control 
treated cells. Experiments were repeated a minimum of 
three times and a representative data set is shown. Student 
t-tests were performed to determine significance between 
treatments and vehicle controls.
Flow cytometry
MDA-MB-231-ERβ cells were plated in 10 cm 
tissue culture dishes in 10% CS-FBS containing medium. 
Following 24 hours of treatment in the absence or 
presence of Dox, cells were treated with ERβ ligands, 
drugs or siRNAs. ERβ ligand treatment was performed 
for both 24 hours and 5 days while drug inhibitors or 
siRNA knockdowns were harvested and assayed after 24 
hours. Propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma-Aldrich) staining was 
performed for cell cycle analysis as previously described 
[60] and AnnexinV/PI (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, 
NJ) staining for apoptosis as previously described [61]. 
Briefly, on the day of harvest, cells were washed once 
with 1X PBS and dissociated using 1 mL TripLETM 
(Invitrogen). For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed, 
permeabilized, and incubated with RNAse A solution (0.1 
mg/mL in 0.1% (w/w) sodium citrate, Roche, Indianapolis, 
IN) for 15 minutes. PI (0.1% mg/mL in 0.1% sodium 
citrate) was added and cells were incubated at room 
temperature in the dark for 15 minutes prior to analysis 
by flow cytometry. For apoptosis analysis, following 
dissociation, cells were stained with Annexin V on ice in 
the dark for 30 minutes. Propidium iodide was then added 
and samples were analyzed within 1 hour. Flow cytometry 
was performed using the FACSCalibur flow machine in 
the Mayo Clinic Flow Cytometry Core Facility (Rochester, 
MN). ModFit LT software was utilized to determine the 
percentage of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases for each 
treatment and subsequently averaged across triplicate 
experiments. CellQuest Pro software was implemented to 
determine the percent Annexin V-positive and Annexin V/
PI-positive cells for each treatment which were considered 
to be apoptotic. Values were summed for each sample and 
averaged among treatment groups.
Apoptosis protein array
MDA-MB-231-ERβ cells were plated in 10 cm 
tissue culture dishes in the presence of Dox and treated 
with ethanol vehicle or 1 nM estrogen for 5 days in 10% 
CS-FBS containing medium. A human apoptosis array kit 
was purchased from R&D systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, 
MN) and the assay was performed following the 
manufacturer’s 
protocol. 
Briefly, 
nitrocellulose 
membranes containing capture and control antibodies 
spotted in duplicate for each target were blocked for an 
hour at room temperature. Four hundred µg of each cell 
lysate was applied to respective membranes and incubated 
overnight at 4°C. The next day, membranes were washed 
and incubated with a cocktail of biotinylated primary 
detection antibodies for an hour at room temperature. After 
washing, membranes were incubated with Streptavidin-
HRP for 30 minutes. One mL of Chemi Reagent Mix was 
applied to each membrane for 1 minute before removal

and exposure to x-ray film. Quantification was performed 
using ImageJ software.
MDA-MB-231-ERβ xenograft studies
MDA-MB-231-ERβ-Luc cells were grown at 
37°C with 5% CO2 until approximately 80% confluency 
at which time they were trypsinized, counted and 
resuspended at 1.0 x 106 cells/100 µL in equal volumes 
of 1X PBS and matrigel. Cells were injected into the 
right flank of six to eight week old ovariectomized female 
nude mice purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar 
Harbor, ME). Tumor volumes were measured weekly 
using digital calipers. Once the average tumor volume 
for all animals reached approximately 100 mm3, mouse 
diets were changed to 200 mg/kg Dox-containing chow 
(TD.98186, Envigo Tekland Diet, Madison, WI) to induce 
tumoral expression of ERβ and animals were randomized 
to placebo or 17β-estradiol (0.54 mg/90-day release) 
pellets (n = 8 animals per group). Pellets were purchased 
from Innovative Research of America (Sarasota, FL) and 
were implanted into the nape of the neck using a trochar. 
Tumor volumes were monitored weekly with digital 
calipers using the formula: Tumor volume = ½(length 
× width2). Additionally, luciferase-based imaging was 
performed as previously described [62] using the Xenogen 
IVIS 200 Imaging System. In brief, mice were sedated 
with Isoflurane and 1 mg D-luciferin (10 mg/mL in PBS) 
was administered via intraperitoneal injection. Images 
were captured approximately 15 minutes after injection to 
allow for the development of complete luciferase activity. 
All animal work was carried out in strict accordance 
with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and 
Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of 
Health. The protocol was approved by the Mayo Clinic 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Permit 
Number: A33015). 
At the time of sacrifice, tumor xenografts were 
dissected and an approximately 5 mm thick section 
was obtained through the center of each tumor and was 
processed for formalin fixation and paraffin embedding. 
Five µm sections were cut and utilized for ERβ IHC 
analysis. Additional tumor pieces were processed for 
RNA extraction using TRIzol® Reagent (ThermoFisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA) and protein extraction using 
RIPA buffer as described below. 
Immunohistochemistry
Five micron formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded 
sections were cut for immunostaining and analyzed as 
previously described [63]. IHC staining was performed 
at the Pathology Research Core (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, 
MN) using the Leica Bond RX stainer (Leica). Briefly, 
tissue slides were dewaxed and retrieved on-line using 
the following reagents Bond Dewax (Leica) and Epitope 
Retrieval 2, EDTA based (Leica Biosystems Inc. Buffalo 
Grove, IL). Tissue slides were retrieved for 30 minutes. 
The ERβ1 PPG5/10 antibody (Thermo Scientific, 
Waltham, MA) was diluted 1:75 in Background Reducing 
Antibody Diluent (Dako, Agilent Technologies, Santa 
Clara, CA) and incubated for 30 minutes. This antibody 
has been shown to be highly specific and sensitive for 
detection of only the full-length form of this receptor in 
previous IHC studies [59-61]. 
Biological pathway analysis
Existing microarray data from our laboratory was 
analyzed for pathways that were significantly altered 
following 1 nM E2 treatment for five days using the 
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA, Ingenuity 
Systems, Inc., Redwood City, CA; http://www.ingenuity.
com). Significant canonical pathways in which the 
Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) in the tested 
samples were enriched were identified. The IPA program 
applies Fisher’s exact test to calculate a p-value that 
represents the probability of the DEGs in the pathway 
being found together due to random chance. Specifically, 
genes identified in the microarray with differential 
expression p-values ≤0.05 and fold-changes ≥1.5 were 
used as focus genes. Pathways with p-values < 0.05 were 
significantly enriched.
Real-time RT-PCR
One microgram of total RNA was reverse 
transcribed using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit 
(Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate 
using a Bio-Rad CFX Real-Time PCR Detection system 
(Hercules, CA). The PerfeCTa™ SYBR Green Fast Mix™ 
(Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) PCR kit was 
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the 
following cycling conditions were employed: 95°C for 
2 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 seconds 
and 60°C for 30 seconds. Melt curves were generated to 
ensure amplification of a single PCR product. Quantitation 
of the PCR results were calculated based on the threshold 
cycle (Ct) and normalized to the controls, TATA Binding 
Protein (TBP) or 18S ribosomal RNA. All PCR primers 
were designed using Primer3 software (http://bioinfo.
ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/primer3/) and were purchased from 
Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primer 
sequences are listed in Table 1.
Western blot analysis
Total protein lysates were prepared using RIPA 
buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 nM NaCl, 1% sodium 
 Oncotarget

deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS). RIPA buffer was 
supplemented with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor 
cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 
Indianapolis, IN) prior to use. Protein concentrations were 
determined using a Bradford assay and equal amounts of 
lysate were loaded onto 4-15% gradient SDS-PAGE gels, 
transferred to PVDF (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and blocked 
with 5% milk in TBST for one hour at room temperature. 
Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies: 
CDK7 (#2916), cyclin B1 (#4138), cyclin H (#2927), 
phospho-CDK1 Thr161 (#9114), and total CDK1 (#9116) 
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), β-catenin 
(#05-665) and Total RNA-Polymerase II (#05-623) from 
Millipore (Billerica, MA), Vinculin (ab129002) and RNA 
Polymerase II phospho-Ser 5 (ab5131) from Abcam 
(Cambridge, MA). Primary antibodies were prepared 
in either 5% milk or 5% BSA in TBST per company 
recommendations and incubated overnight at 4°C. After 
washing, blots were incubated with anti-mouse sc-2005 
and anti-rabbit sc-2004 secondary antibodies from Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX) for one hour at room 
temperature. Blots were imaged on the Odyssey Fc (LI-
COR, Lincoln, NE) system with the imager set to capture 
the 700 nm and chemi channels for 30 seconds and 10 
minutes, respectively. 
For infrared fluorescence, protein lysates were 
prepared, loaded, and the gel was run exactly as 
described above. Proteins were transferred onto FL PVDF 
membranes (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and blocked with 
Odyssey blocking buffer for one hour at room temperature. 
Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies: 
ERβ (#8974) from Santa Cruz (Dallas, TX) and B-actin 
(#A2228) from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Primary antibodies 
were prepared in Odyssey PBS buffer and incubated 
overnight at 4°C. After washing, blots were incubated 
with anti-mouse 680RD or anti-rabbit 800CW secondary 
antibodies for one hour at room temperature protected 
from the light. Blots were imaged on the Odyssey Fc (LI-
COR, Lincoln, NE) system with the imager set to capture 
the 700 nm and 800 nm channels. 
CDK1 and CDK7 inhibition
For 
knockdown 
experiments, 
two 
pre-
designed siRNAs targeting both CDK1 and CDK7 
were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) 
and consisted of the following sequences: CDK1-9: 
5’-GUACAGAUCUCCAGAAGUA-3’, 
CDK1-10: 
5’-GAUCAACUCUUCAGGAUUU-3’, 
CDK7-5: 
5’-GGACAUAGAUCAGAAGCUA-3’, 
CDK7-6: 
5’-CAAUAGAGCUUAUACACAU-3’. The siGENOME 
Non-Targeting siRNA Pool 1 (Dharmacon; D-001206-
13) was used as a negative control. Transfections were 
performed with a pool of the two CDK1 or CDK7 
siRNAs, or the control siRNA, using Dharmafect Reagent 
1 (Dharmacon; T-2001) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. A final concentration of 25 nM of total siRNA 
was used for all experiments. 
Drug mediated inhibition of CDK1 and CDK7 was 
performed using dinaciclib (CDK1) and BS-181 (CDK7). 
Dose-response proliferation assays were performed for 
six days to determine the inhibitory concentration of 
50% of our MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50) for each CDK 
inhibitor. The CDK inhibitors were tested at the following 
concentrations: dinaciclib at 10 nM, 25 nM and 50 nM and 
BS-181 at 5 µM, 10 µM, and 20 µM. Proliferation assays 
were performed after six days while cell cycle analysis via 
flow cytometry was performed after 48 hours following 
knockdown or drug inhibition of CDK1 and CKD7 as 
described above. 
Statistical analysis
All of the in vitro experiments were conducted 
with a minimum of three biological replicates with 3-6 
technical replicates per assay and representative data 
sets are shown. A students t-test was used to determine 
statistical significance between treatments relative 
to controls. P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered to be 
statistically significant. For the animal models, 8 mice per 
treatment group were utilized and a log-rank test was used 
to assess whether time to tumor doubling differed between
