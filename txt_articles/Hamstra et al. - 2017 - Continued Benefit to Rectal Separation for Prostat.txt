 Summary
A phase III trial was per-
formed using an absorbable
hydrogel (SpaceOAR System)
to provide space between the
prostate and rectum for men
undergoing dose-escalated
prostate radiation therapy. At
3 years, the men in the spacer
arm had decreased bowel
toxicity and fewer declines in
both urinary and bowel qual-
ity of life compared with the
control group.
Purpose: SpaceOAR, a Food and Drug Administrationeapproved hydrogel intended
to create a rectaleprostate space, was evaluated in a single-blind phase III trial of
image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy. A total of 222 men were random-
ized 2:1 to the spacer or control group and received 79.2 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions to the
prostate with or without the seminal vesicles. The present study reports the final results
with a median follow-up period of 3 years.
Methods and Materials: Cumulative (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, version 4.0) toxicity was evaluated using the log-rank test. Quality of life
(QOL) was examined using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC),
and the mean changes from baseline in the EPIC domains were tested using repeated
measures models. The proportions of men with minimally important differences
(MIDs) in each domain were tested using repeated measures logistic models with pre-
specified thresholds.
Results: The 3-year incidence of grade �1 (9.2% vs 2.0%; PZ.028) and grade �2
(5.7% vs 0%; PZ.012) rectal toxicity favored the spacer arm. Grade �1 urinary in-
continence was also lower in the spacer arm (15% vs 4%; PZ.046), with no difference
in grade �2 urinary toxicity (7% vs 7%; PZ0.7). From 6 months onward, bowel QOL
consistently favored the spacer group (PZ.002), with the difference at 3 years (5.8
points; P<.05) meeting the threshold for a MID. The control group had a 3.9-point
greater decline in urinary QOL compared with the spacer group at 3 years (P<.05),
but the difference did not meet the MID threshold. At 3 years, more men in the control
group than in the spacer group had experienced a MID decline in bowel QOL (41% vs
14%; PZ.002) and urinary QOL (30% vs 17%; PZ.04). Furthermore, the control
group were also more likely to have experienced large declines (twice the MID) in
bowel QOL (21% vs 5%; PZ.02) and urinary QOL (23% vs 8%; PZ.02).
Conclusions: The benefit of a hydrogel spacer in reducing the rectal dose, toxicity, and
QOL declines after image guided intensity modulated radiation therapy for prostate
cancer was maintained or increased with a longer follow-up period, providing stronger
evidence for the benefit of hydrogel spacer use in prostate radiation therapy. � 2017

Introduction
External beam radiation therapy (RT) is used to treat men
with prostate cancer and results in outcomes similar to those
with surgery for patients with low- or intermediate-risk
disease (1) and improved survival when added to androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) for high-risk disease (2, 3). Dose
escalation improves the outcomes but increases the risk of
urinary and bowel toxicity (4). Both image guided RT
(IGRT) (5-7) and intensity modulated RT (IMRT) (8) have
been used to limit margins and conform the high-dose ra-
diation volume to limit toxicity. Nevertheless, because the
rectum and prostate are often in physical contact, the ability
of IGRT and IMRT to spare the rectum has been limited.
The SpaceOAR System (Augmenix, Inc, Waltham, MA) is
the only Food and Drug Administrationeapproved absorbable
hydrogel that can be introduced between the prostate and
rectumtodecreasetoxicityandminimizethechangesinquality
of life (QOL) after prostate RT. The 15-month follow-up data
from the SpaceOAR phase III trial were previously reported.
The results showed that >97% of men had a clinically signif-
icant 25% relative reduction in the rectal V70, with a reduction
in rectal toxicity and improvements in bowel QOL (9). The
present study reports the updated results with a median follow-
up period of 37 months.
Methods and Materials
Patient population and treatment
The details of the phase III study were previously reported
(10, 11). Men with National Comprehensive Cancer Net-
workedetermined low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer
and a Zubrod performance status of 0 to 1 were enrolled in
a multi-institutional institutional review boardeapproved
single-blind phase III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01538628). The exclusion criteria included prostate
volume �80 cm3, extraprostatic extension, >50% positive
biopsy cores, previous or planned use of ADT, and/or
previous treatment of prostate cancer. The patients were
randomized 2:1 to the spacer or control group, with all men
receiving fiducial markers for IGRT. The patients were
unaware of the treatment allocation and had the fiducial

 markers or markers plus the hydrogel spacer placed without
knowing to which treatment they had been randomized.
Magnetic resonance imagingebased planning was used,
with the postfiducial marker computed tomography scan
fused with the magnetic resonance imaging scan. The use
of intravenous, oral, or bladder/urethral contrast were at the
discretion of the investigators. The radiation plans were
evaluated by an independent core laboratory before treat-
ment for compliance to the protocol guidelines and deter-
mination of the dosimetric endpoints (H.G., W.B., J.M.).
The clinical target volume was the prostate with or
without the seminal vesicles at the physician’s discretion. A
planning target volume (PTV) margin of 5 to 10 mm was
used. The radiation dose was 79.2 Gy in 1.8-Gy daily
fractions, delivered 5 days weekly.
Data collection and follow-up protocol
The men were followed up weekly during treatment and at
3, 6, 12, and 15 months after enrollment. The primary
endpoint was reported at 15 months (10). Extended follow-
up data at 3 years were recorded, with local institutional
review board approval to gather Expanded Prostate Cancer
Index (EPIC) data, prostate-specific antigen, medical and
surgical history, rectal and urinary adverse events, and
medication changes since the 15-month visit. Participation
in this extended follow-up protocol was voluntary, with
each institution choosing whether they would participate.
Rectal and urinary adverse events were adjudicated by an
independent clinical events committee that was unaware of
the treatment arm according to the event type, severity, and
relatedness to radiation or other factors. Adverse events
attributed to radiation were included for toxicity analysis in
accordance with the National Cancer Institute’s Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
Statistical analysis
The toxicity events from enrollment through 3 months of
follow-up were classified as acute, and those occurring after
3 months were classified as late. The cumulative incidence
of late toxicity was evaluated using the log-rank test and
Kaplan-Meier analysis by randomization arm.
For the QOL analysis, the mean changes in the EPIC
summary scores from baseline were evaluated in linear
mixed models with the fixed effects of randomized treat-
ment, questionnaire completion date, and baseline score. The
interaction of randomized treatment and questionnaire
completion date and repeated measures within patient
groups were accounted for using an autoregressive correla-
tion structure. Pairwise testing was done within the modeling
framework. Minimally important differences (MIDs) in the
EPIC summary scores were evaluated according to previ-
ously published thresholds: bowel (5 points), urinary (6
points), sexual (11 points), and vitality/hormonal (5 points)
(12). In addition, a second preplanned cutpoint was
evaluated twice at each of these thresholds. Each binary
MID variable was modeled using a General Estimating
Equation model with a logit link to account for the repeated
surveys for each patient over time and the independent ef-
fects of randomized treatment, questionnaire completion
date, baseline domain score, and the interaction of ran-
domized treatment and questionnaire completion date.
Analysis was performed in SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).
Biochemical failure was defined using the Phoenix
definition (nadir plus 2 ng/mL) (13).
Results
From January 2012 to April 2013, 222 eligible men from 20
participating institutions were enrolled and randomized to the
control (nZ73) or spacer (nZ149) arm. No differences were
found in the demographic data between the 2 arms (Table E1;
available online at www.redjournal.org). The primary end-
points were reported at a minimum follow-up point of
15 months, when 97% of the control group and 99% of the
spacer group were evaluable. Extended follow-up was
continued through April 2016, when 63% of both control
(nZ46) and spacer (nZ94) patients were evaluable. No dif-
ferencewas found in the median follow-up period between the
2 treatment arms in the extended study (control: median
37.0 months, range 26-46; spacer: median 37.1 months, range
32-47;P>.5;Fig.E1;availableonlineatwww.redjournal.org).
Dosimetry
Compared with the control arm, those with the hydrogel
(spacer arm) had a smaller volume of rectum treated to all
volumesfromV50 toV80 (P<.0001 for all;Fig.1A).ForV50,
a54%relativereductionwasfound(21%vs10%forcontrolvs
spacer), with increasing relative reductions at higher doses.
These included a 79% relative reduction in V70 (10% vs 2%
for control vs spacer) and a 96% reduction in the V80 (4% vs
0.1% for control vs spacer). No differences were found in the
dosimetry values for the bladder, bladder wall, or bladder/
bladder wall within 1 or 2 cm of the prostate (P>.1 for all). In
addition, no differences were found in the hot spots in the PTV
(>79.2 Gy; P>.1). The dose to the penile bulb was signifi-
cantly reduced in the spacer arm for the mean, median,
maximum dose, and doses from V10 to V30 (Fig. 1B).
Toxicity
Grade �1 rectal toxicity at 3 years of follow-up was decreased
by 75% in the spacer arm (control: 9%, 95% confidence in-
terval [CI] 4%-20%; spacer: 2%, 95% CI 1%-6%; P<.03;
hazard ratio 0.24, 95% CI 0.06-0.97), and no grade �2 rectal
toxicity was observed in the spacer arm (3-year rate: control,
6%, 95% CI 2%-17%; spacer 0%; P<.015; Figs. 2A and 2B).
One case of grade 3 rectal toxicity developed in the control
arm. A reductionwas also seen incumulative grade�1 urinary

 incontinence at 3 years (control: 15%, 95% CI 8%-29%;
spacer:4%, 95% CI2%-10%;PZ.046; hazard ratio0.36, 95%
CI 0.12-1.1), without a difference in other grade �1 urinary
toxicities (P>.5) or grade �2 urinary toxicity (P>.5; Figs. 2C
and 2D; Fig. E2; available online at www.redjournal.org).
Quality of life
Bowel QOL
Both arms had similar acute declines in bowel QOL between
enrollment and 3 months after treatment, with return toward
baseline at 6 months (Fig. 3A). Numerically, from 6 months
through 3 years, the spacer arm bowel QOL score was near
or greater than the baseline score but had declined in the
control arm (PZ.002). The mean difference of 5.8 points in
the bowel summary score at 3 years between the control
(�5.3 points) and spacer (þ0.5 points) groups met the pre-
viously established threshold for a MID of 4 to 6 points (12).
The proportion of patients with measurable changes in
bowel QOL meeting the MID threshold (5 points; Fig. 3B)
or twice that threshold (10 points; Fig. 3C) was also evalu-
ated. From 6 months through 3 years, more men in the
control arm had a MID in bowel QOL meeting the
threshold of 5 points (PZ.009), but no difference was found
for a 10-point decline (PZ.14). Both differences increased
with a longer follow-up duration, such that at 3 years, men
treated with the spacer were less likely to have a detectable
change in bowel QOL for both thresholds (5-point: 41%
vs 14%, PZ.002, odds ratio [OR] 0.28, 95% CI 0.13-0.63;
10-point: 21% vs 5%, PZ.02, OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.83).

 Dosimetric analysis revealed a correlation between
an increasing rectal V50 to V80 and a decline in
bowel QOL (P<.03 for all; Table E2; available online at
www.redjournal.org). In addition, those treated to the
prostate and seminal vesicles were more likely to have a
decline in bowel QOL compared with those treated to the
prostate only; however, the relative benefit of hydrogel
spacer use was independent of seminal vesicle treatment
(Fig. E3; available online at www.redjournal.org).
Urinary QOL
For urinary QOL, a similar decline was seen at 3 months
between the treatment arms, which again had approached
baseline by 6 months (Fig. 4A). When averaged over the
entire follow-up duration, no significant difference was
found in the mean urinary QOL between the 2 arms
(P<.13). At the 3-year point, a statistically significant dif-
ference was found in urinary QOL favoring the spacer arm
(þ0.6 points) compared with the control arm (�3.3 points;
PZ.04). However, the difference of 3.9 points did not meet
the criteria for a MID (5-7 points). When assessing the
proportion of men throughout the follow-up period with a
MID in urinary QOL, no difference was found in those with
a 6-point decline (PZ.13; Fig. 4B). However, a smaller
proportion of men had a 12-point decline in urinary QOL in
the spacer arm (P<.035; Fig. 4C). Again, the differences
increased over time, such that at 3 years, significantly fewer
men had either a 6-point (30% vs 17%, P<.05, OR 0.41,
95% CI 0.18-0.95) or 12-point (23% vs 8%, P<.03, OR
0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.85) decline. No dosimetric variables
correlated with urinary QOL.
Other QOL analysis
Aspreviouslyreported,nosignificantdifferenceswerefoundin
sexual QOL or vitality/hormonal QOL between the random-
ized arms (Fig. E4; available online at www.redjournal.org).
Nor were significant differences found in the proportion of
patients with MID changes between the treatment arms for
either the vitality/hormonal or sexual domains (P>.1 for both;
data not shown). The dose to the penile bulb, although different
between the treatment arms (Fig. 1B), was low in both groups
and did not correlate with the change in the EPIC sexual
summary score for all patients or each randomized arm.
The proportion of patients with moderate or large
problems in QOL according to each item on the EPIC
questionnaire was also assessed (Tables E3-E6; available
online at www.redjournal.org). At 3 years, only 1 item
showed a statistically significant difference at this threshold
between the treatment arms (bother secondary to urinary
frequency: control 18% vs spacer 5%; P<.05). However, of
all 50 items, 14 had differences of �5% between treatment
arms at 3 years. Of these items, 13 favored the spacer arm
(3 bowel, 3 urinary, 5 sexual, and 2 vitality/hormonal) and
only 1 (weight gain) favored the control arm.
For all patients in the study (spacer plus control), an
overall decline in urinary QOL of 6 and 12 points at 3 years
was seen in 21% and 13% of the patients, respectively. A
strong association was found between the decline in bowel

 QOL and concomitant decline in urinary QOL. The 6-point
urinary decline was seen in 14% of the men who did not
have a bowel change but in 45% of those with a detect-
able 5-point decline in bowel QOL (P<.0001, OR 4.3,
95% CI 3.3-5.8), with a similar correlation found for the
12-point decline in urinary QOL. A 12-point decline was
observed in 7.5% of the men with stable bowel function but
in 62% of the men with a detectable 10-point decrease in
bowel QOL (P<.0001, OR 7.4, 95% CI 5.2-10.6).
Given the greater likelihood of experiencing urinary
QOL changes in the face of bowel changes, we next
assessed the overall burden of QOL changes at 3 years at
the 1� and 2� MID thresholds for bowel, urinary, and
sexual QOL (Fig. 5). At 3 years, 46% of men in the spacer
arm had no detectable change in any of the 3 QOL domains
compared with 35% in the control arm, and 67% of the
spacer group had no changes meeting the 2� thresholds
compared with 58% of the control group. Furthermore, in
the control arm, more men had a decline in all 3 domains
(20% control vs 2.5% spacer for 1� MID and 12.5%
control vs 0% spacer for 2� MID). The statistical signifi-
cance of the differences in the patients with declines in �1
QOL domain were different between the 2 treatment arms
(c2, PZ.0017 for 1� MID and PZ.0049 for 2� MID).
Given the 63% response rate at 3 years, we also per-
formed sensitivity analyses comparing potential differences
between those with or without a response at the 3-year
point (Table E7; available online at www.redjournal.org).
No difference was found in the QOL at either baseline or
15 months between those with and without a response. For
all QOL domains, a similar relationship was found between
the treatment arm and the change in mean QOL for those
with and without a response both during the follow-up
period time and at 36 months (Table E8; available online
at www.redjournal.org). For bowel QOL, similar differ-
ences were also observed in those achieving a 5- or 10-

 point decline when limited to those with all data available
compared with the initial analysis of all patients (Fig. E5;
available online at www.redjournal.org).

found in the nadir prostate-specific antigen level after RT in
either arm (0.5 ng/mL; P>.5).
Discussion
The results of the present prospective single-blind ran-
domized phase III trial have demonstrated that the hydrogel
spacer was safe to apply and well tolerated and resulted in a
significant rectal dose reduction. Furthermore, the benefit
seen
with
the
hydrogel
spacer
at
15
months
for
bowel toxicity and QOL was maintained or had increased at
the 3-year median follow-up period.
The control arm had very low rates of rectal toxicity
compared with previous reports (14-19). The cumulative
rate of grade �2 bowel toxicity was 6% at 3 years in the
control arm, with no cases of grade �2 toxicity in the
spacer arm. These results compare favorably with those
from recently published multi-institutional studies such as
the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0126 trial (79.2 Gy
in 1.8-Gy fractions, IMRT, unknown use of IGRT, grade �2
rectal toxicity rate of 15.1%) (14) or Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group 0415 trial (73.8 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions, all
IGRT, 79% IMRT, grade �2 rectal toxicity rate of 11.4%)
(17). The low toxicity in the control arm might have been
related to a number of factors, including different toxicity
scales, uniform use of both IMRT and IGRT, small PTV
margins, magnetic resonance imaging planning, and strict
dosimetric constraints with centralized pretreatment review
of the plans. Nevertheless, despite the overall excellent
results in the control arm, the addition of the hydrogel
spacer still resulted in statistically significant and clinically
meaningful reductions in toxicity and improvements in
bowel QOL. This highlights 1 notable strength of the pre-
sent study in that the outcomes using both physician-scored
toxicity
(Common
Terminology
Criteria
for
Adverse
Events, version 4.0) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs;
EPIC) resulted in similar and complementary conclusions,
both favoring the spacer arm. The present study was also
performed across 20 centers, reflecting broad applicability.
Despite the low rates of physician-scored toxicity, the
analysis of PROs revealed greater rates of measurable de-
clines in QOL. In the control arm at 3 years, 41% of patients
exhibited a detectable decline in bowel QOL (5 points) using
the PROs, which met the definition of a MID, and 21%
experienced a more serious decline (10 points). These rates
were both reduced by 70% in the spacer arm (14% and 5%,
respectively). Additionally, for urinary QOL at 3 years, 30%
of the men in the control arm reported detectable declines (6
points), with most (23%) reporting a decline in urinary QOL,
which was �2 times the MID (12 points). Again, the use of
the hydrogel spacer reduced the likelihood of either a MID
or more serious changes in urinary QOL by >60% (with
rates in the spacer arm of 17% and 8%, respectively). Thus,
despite an overall favorable toxicity profile, a substantial
portion of patients were still likely to obtain a benefit from
the use of the absorbable hydrogel spacer, as measured by
PROs. This difference was also evident when analyzing the
proportion of patients with multidomain changes across all 3
domains (urinary, sexual, and bowel). In the spacer arm, 46%
of the men had no clinically detectable change in any QOL
domain at 3 years; the rate was 35% for the control arm. In
addition, for the men in the control group, 20% had changes
meeting the threshold for MID in all 3 arms compared with
only 2.5% in the spacer group. Also, 12.5% of the control
group had large changes (2� MID) in all 3 domains at
3 years compared with no men with 2� MID across all 3
domains in the spacer group.
The number needed to treat (NNT) is a useful metric to
estimate the proportion of patients expected to derive a
benefit from the use of an intervention. The NNT to spare 1
cumulative grade �1 bowel toxicity at 3 years was 14.3 and
for grade �2 bowel toxicity, was 16.7. The patient-reported
QOL outcomes might provide a more sensitive metric,
because it better reflects the patient’s experience and pri-
orities and is complementary to physician-scored toxicity.
The NNT to prevent 1 detectable change in bowel QOL at
3 years (5-point threshold) was 3.7 compared with a NNT
of 6.3 for the more severe change in bowel QOL (10-point
threshold). Furthermore, the use of a hydrogel spacer also
decreased the incidence of urinary incontinence and
resulted in a statistically significant (albeit not clinically
significant) improvement in the average urinary QOL at
3 years. Despite not causing, on average, a clinically
meaningful benefit in urinary QOL, a substantial minority
of patients did have detectable declines in urinary QOL,
such that the NNT to prevent 1 patient with a MID decline
in urinary QOL (6-point threshold) at 3 years was 7.7 and
was 6.7 when the more severe threshold of twice the MID
was used (12 points). When considering QOL more
broadly, the NNT to prevent 1 man from experiencing a
measurable decline in all 3 domains was 9.1 for the 1�
MID threshold and 8.0 for the 2� MID threshold.
Unlike bowel QOL, for which previous studies have
identified strong correlations between radiation dosimetry
and declines in PROs, which we also noted (Fig. 1; Table
E2; available online at www.redjournal.org) (19, 20), we
were unable to identify dosimetric characteristics that
correlated with the differences in urinary toxicity and QOL.
The structures evaluated included the bladder, bladder wall,
bladder neck, prostate, and penile bulb (as a surrogate for
genitourinary diaphragm). Some, although not all, previous
studies have reported a correlation between the dose to the
urethra and the occurrence of urinary toxicity after high-
dose RT. However, using the treatment plans available,
we did not have a urethral structure for evaluation. Men

 with a detectable change in bowel QOL were approxi-
mately five-fold more likely to exhibit detectable changes
in urinary QOL. A number of possibilities exist to explain
this association: different organs at risk with an association
to urinary QOL that have not yet been identified (eg,
intraprostatic urethra, distal urethra, or bladder trigone) (21,
22) but that might have been spared by the spacer treat-
ment; potentially more intrinsic radiosensitivity in those
exhibiting both bowel and urinary QOL declines (23); a
greater likelihood of reporting urinary differences, even if
not present, when bowel differences are present (24); and a
greater likelihood of men reporting urinary issues owing to
increased restroom usage secondary to bowel changes.
Since the initiation of the present clinical trial, the use of
other dose-escalated RT modalities for the treatment of
prostate cancer has increased, including moderately hypo-
fractionated RT, stereotactic body RT, brachytherapy as
monotherapy or a boost, and proton therapy (17, 18, 25-33).
With each of these treatment modalities, bowel toxicity and
changes in QOL have been associated with the dose to the
rectum, which in some cases can be extreme. In 1 recent
stereotactic body RT trial, nearly 10% of patients in the
highest dose arm required a colostomy (33). Thus, the benefits
obtained through prostateerectal spacing using convention-
ally fractionated RT could also be evident using these other
treatment techniques, such that with further dose intensifica-
tion, the hydrogel spacer might have greater effects.
Conclusions
We have reported the first level 1 evidence from a ran-
domized phase III trial of an RT technique for prostate
cancer to demonstrate reductions in rectal dosimetry and
improvements in both toxicity and QOL. Encouragingly,
the differences identified at the 15-month minimum follow-
up
point
(10)
appear
to
have
been
maintained
or
increased at 3 years. For radiation technologies, only the
use of 3-dimensional conformal RT had previously been
tested in such a phase III trial (34). Nevertheless, both
IGRT and IMRT have been routinely adopted despite
lacking a similar level of evidence (35). Future work might
be able to identify the clinical and dosimetric risk factors
that can determine those at greatest risk of rectal toxicity
and who might stand to benefit the most from the use of a
spacer (36). It is also notable that the use of this hydrogel
spacer provided a clinically meaningful improvement even
in the best current standard of care for conventionally
fractionated dose-escalated RT, with PROs identifying
significant improvements in both urinary and bowel QOL.
