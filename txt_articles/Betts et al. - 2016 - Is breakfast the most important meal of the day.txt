The Bath Breakfast Project is a series of randomised controlled trials exploring the effects of
extended morning fasting on energy balance and health. These trials were categorically not
designed to answer whether or not breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
However, this review will philosophise about the meaning of that question and about
what questions we should be asking to better understand the effects of breakfast, before sum-
marising how individual components of energy balance and health respond to breakfast v.
fasting in lean and obese adults. Current evidence does not support a clear effect of regularly
consuming or skipping breakfast on body mass/composition, metabolic rate or diet-induced
thermogenesis. Findings regarding energy intake are variable, although the balance of evi-
dence indicates some degree of compensatory feeding later in the day such that overall en-
ergy intake is either unaffected or slightly lower when breakfast is omitted from the diet.
However, even if net energy intake is reduced, extended morning fasting may not result in
expected weight loss due to compensatory adjustments in physical activity thermogenesis.
Specifically, we report that both lean and obese adults expended less energy during the
morning when remaining in the fasted state than when consuming a prescribed breakfast.
Further research is required to examine whether particular health markers may be respon-
sive to breakfast-induced responses of individual components of energy balance irrespective
of their net effect on energy balance and therefore body mass.
Fasting: Energy balance: Health: Thermogenesis
The broad field of nutrition and health is rife with myths,
misconceptions and frequently posed yet seemingly fun-
damental questions that we intuitively feel should have
simple answers. Is a calorie a calorie? Is obesity due to
eating too much or doing too little? Is breakfast the
most important meal of the day? Often there are simple
answers, the first two being central to the themes
considered in the present review and both absolutely
‘yes’ (just as a second is a second, one thermochemical
calorie is simply a unit of measurement equivalent to
4·18 J). The third is not so easily answered and there
can be no correct response until we refine that question;
‘If you wish to converse with me’ said Voltaire ‘define
your terms’. In this case, we must define both what is

meant by breakfast and what is meant by important (i.e.
important for what?).
Framing our question in terms of whether breakfast is
the most important meal of the day also implies some in-
herent value in comparing breakfast with other daily eat-
ing occasions. Why should the potential benefits of
breakfast and therefore our decision about breakfast con-
sumption depend on the relative importance of lunch or
dinner? For example, breakfast consumption is unlikely
to be more important for our general health than physic-
al exercise or not smoking but that does not discount that
breakfast may be sufficiently important to form part of a
wider healthy lifestyle(1–4). Indeed, markers of a healthy
lifestyle are associated with frequent breakfast consump-
tion, which confounds interpretation of causal links
between breakfast and good health.
The true question to be explored in the present review
therefore concerns our daily decision about when to
interrupt an extended period of fasting (e.g. overnight).
Whether what might then be defined as breakfast and
has the potential to cause meaningful effects on various
health markers across different populations and contexts
can then be considered. While this approach is unlikely
to fit the false dichotomy through which the media obses-
sively brand any given health strategy as universally good
or bad, the truth is understandably less extreme or con-
sistent (i.e. breakfast is probably more or less important
for some outcomes/people per day than for others).
What do we mean by ‘Breakfast’?
One issue contributing to the apparently conflicting
findings in this area is that there is no universally accepted
definition of breakfast(5); and why should there be?
Without thinking about this too hard, it might at first
seem logical simply to define breakfast as the first meal
of the day. This is then consistent with the etymology to
‘break’ the ‘fast’ and may work for some as a general de-
scription of breakfast but is logically flawed and not overly
helpful as a scientific definition. Consider an individual
who breaks their fast shortly after waking by ingesting en-
ergy from carbohydrate, protein and fat in the form of cof-
fee with milk and sugar, then nothing else until
early-afternoon when the same mixed-macronutrients
(plus alcohol) are consumed but this time in the form of
spaghetti Bolognese and wine. Opinions may now be
divided about whether this person had breakfast at all
and, if so, whether it was coffee and/or spaghetti and
wine. Can we count a cup of coffee as a meal? Was the spa-
ghetti consumed in the fasted-state (i.e. post-absorptive)?
What if we learn that this person woke at midday?
These differences of opinion become problematic when
scientific investigations have surveyed breakfast habits or
recommended breakfast consumption but allowed indi-
vidual interpretation regarding what constitutes breakfast.
This can be informative from a sociological perspective
but it is helpful when considering physiological health
effects to employ a more precise and consistent operation-
al definition. Taking the earlier example, some studies
have included only solid foods as breakfast irrespective
of the many highly calorific beverages available, yet (not-
withstanding differences in gastric emptying rate and
metabolic response to different nutrients in solid v. liquid
form(6)), our net energy balance does not discriminate be-
tween absorbed nutrients or calories depending on
whether they required chewing; ‘a calorie is a calorie’.
While in the future it might become possible to justify
a rationale for defining meals based on a certain mixture
of nutrients, a logical starting point to define the essential
conditions of breakfast per se would be based on the
quantity and timing of energy consumed. We propose
that a quantity of 209·2 kJ (50 kcal) represents an appro-
priate arbitrary threshold to exclude common ingestive
behaviours that would neither be recognised as a meal
by the majority of people nor meaningfully shift our
physiology towards the fed-state, a marker of which
could be a detectable perturbation in exogenous and/or
endogenous substrate utilisation (thus one standard tea/
coffee would be unlikely to meet this criterion).
The issue of timing is more complex and can be con-
sidered relative to time of day, time of waking and/or
the intervals that distinguish separate eating occasions.
A universal definition of breakfast as morning feeding
based purelyon light–dark cycles (i.e. clock time) independ-
ent of sleep–wakes cycles (or vice versa) is complicated by
variance in these very cycles due to geographical/seasonal
differences in daylight hours or cultural/vocational differ-
ences in sleeping patterns (e.g. night-shift workers). A nom-
inal period of 2 h after waking is also often applied to the
definition of the breakfast meal, with separate meals in
turn having been distinguished from snacks by a cut-off
quantity of approximately 1087·8 kJ (260 kcal) and distinct
eating occasions isolated on the basis of a 45 min interval(7).
On balance, it therefore seems reasonable for a working
definition of breakfast to represent the first meal consumed
within2 h afterthelongestsleep in any 24 h period,thusnor-
mally also reflecting the longest daily duration spent in the
fasted-state and the only time most of us are genuinely
post-absorptive(8).
According to the earlier rationale, our research involved
approximately 70 lean and obese adults, of whom none
worked night-shifts and approximately one-third habit-
ually consumed <209·2 kJ (50 kcal) within 2 h of waking
on most days, so might be classified as breakfast skippers.
These individuals kindly participated in a series of experi-
ments known as the Bath Breakfast Project, in which we
allocated the habitual breakfast consumers and skippers
equally into groups who for 6 weeks either: extended
their overnight fast (0 kJ) until midday everyday; con-
sumed 1464·4 kJ (350 kcal) within 2 h of waking and at
least 2928·8 kJ (700 kcal) before 11.00 hours everyday;
or maintained their usual lifestyles for 6 weeks(9).
In contrast to the wealth of evidence contrasting differ-
ent types or amounts of breakfast foods, this is the first ran-
domised controlled trial to compare a treatment involving
breakfast with the complete absence of morning feeding in
relation to all components of energy balance. Whilst the
project therefore ostensibly concerns breakfast (indeed,
you may only be reading the present paper due to a shared
interest in that meal), our intervention from a basic science
perspective is in fact the fasting treatment, with morning

feeding serving as a control (Bath Extended Morning
Fasting Project did not seem so catchy). On that basis,
the precise composition of breakfast prescribed was less
important at this stage than simply ensuring that whatever
was ingested differed sufficiently from fasting that mean-
ingful effects would be detectable should they exist. The
added practical benefits of this initial approach are that
any significant effects could be generalised more broadly
as responses to fasting as opposed to the presence or ab-
sence of specific foods consumed at breakfast; whereas
none could argue that these treatments fail to polarise
the contrast and meet all but the most extreme and unusual
definitions of breakfast.
What do we mean by ‘Important’?
If you are hungry upon waking and personally prefer to
promptly satiate your hunger, then breakfast is undoubt-
edly the most important (i.e. only) meal suited to that
purpose. Similarly, if your morning will involve physical
exercise with performance on that day a priority, then
consuming a carbohydrate-rich breakfast is the most im-
portant
meal
to achieve your
immediate goals(10).
However, if we place importance on long-term health
outcomes, these generally do not respond acutely to a
single food or meal but instead require sustained expos-
ure to a consistent dietary pattern. In this case, we are
asking whether regular daily breakfast has a chronic ef-
fect on energy balance and associated health outcomes.
The presentreviewwillsequentiallyconsidertheeffectsof
breakfast v. extended morning fasting on the various indi-
vidual components of energy balance and health. For each
outcome, we will first summarise the state of evidence link-
ing breakfast to energy balance prior to our recent rando-
mised controlled trial. That is the evidence upon which the
pervasive societal beliefs about breakfast rested(11), despite
being almost entirely cross-sectional in nature. The vast
and diverse populations surveyed are a legitimate strength
of these epidemiological studies but are also responsible
for
misconceptions
amongst
a
public
(and
media)
ill-equipped to evaluate research design, measurement
error or controls, so who are inclined only to believe the
findings (or headlines) from studies perceived to be large
(again, define your terms). Conversely, other studies are
too often discounted forbeing smallirrespective of accuracy
and precision in measurement (for a primer see How big
does mysample need to be?(12)), which means we sometimes
miss the opportunity to complement epidemiology with
causal evidence from focused, tightly controlled and prop-
erly powered experiments (i.e. research where interventions
and controls are directly manipulated). We will therefore
set-out here how our understanding of causality specific
to each outcome has been advanced by our recent series
of randomised controlled trials; the Bath Breakfast Project.
Body mass/composition
As recently reviewed, although the extent to which the
mere association between breakfast omission and obesity
has
been
verified
can
be
described
as
gratuitous,
confirmatory studies continue to emerge even today des-
pite the stated relationship confirmed by meta-analysis at
a confidence level of P = 0·001 almost 20 years ago (ris-
ing to P < 10−42 at the most recent cut-off in 2011)(11).
There can be little doubt, therefore, that individuals
who more frequently consume breakfast tend to be leaner
and that this pattern hardly varies across a diverse range
of human populations. However, no matter how strong
these correlations may be, they cannot be used to draw
a causal inference and so cannot inform evidence-based
recommendations either encouraging or discouraging
breakfast for the purposes of weight-management.
The Bath Breakfast Project was designed primarily to
examine individual components of energy balance as
opposed to long-term weight-change, as evident in the
fact that the intervention was applied for only 6 weeks
with direct prescription and adherence to the treatments
(i.e. a completers-only analysis)(9). In this sense, our
examination of body mass changes as an indication of
net energy (im)balance better reflects an efficacy trial
and nicely complements the results of a concurrent effect-
iveness trial which reported no significant difference in
weight-loss over 16 weeks with a recommendation to
eat or skip breakfast (i.e. an intention-to-treat ana-
lysis)(13). Our data are consistent with this conclusion in
that there was no significant difference in total body
mass change between breakfast v. fasting amongst indivi-
duals who were either lean(14) or obese(15), although it is
interesting to contrast the pattern of changes in dual-
energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived body composition
between groups across both levels of adiposity (Fig. 1).
As can be seen, despite the absence of differences be-
tween groups according to the breakfast intervention,
there were significant within-group changes from base-
line but with the pattern reversed according to adiposity
and treatment group. Specifically working from left to
right across Fig. 1, lean individuals in the fasting group
did not compensate for the energy ‘missed’ at breakfast,
hence there is a significant reduction in body mass (most-
ly from fat loss); whereas lean individuals in the breakfast
group certainly do not gain weight despite the relatively
large prescription of at least 2928·8 kJ (700 kcal) by
11.00 hours daily for 6 weeks(14). In contrast, it was the
fasting group in the obese population who exhibited
the greatest compensation, with avoidance of weight-loss
despite consuming not a single calorie until midday every
day for 6 weeks; whereas the obese individuals in the
breakfast group clearly did not compensate by expending
the prescribed energy intake (or reducing subsequent en-
ergy intake sufficiently) and so increased energy storage
in the form of adipose tissue(15).
The net effect of the earlier pattern is that, whether fed
or fasted in the mornings, lean individuals may favour a
more negative energy balance and obese individuals a
more positive energy balance. This could mean that an
individual’s natural propensity to compensate is what
determines the extent of adiposity and/or could equally
mean that the extent of adiposity determines compensa-
tion. Whichever is the case, we begin to question both

according
to
adiposity
and
what
mechanisms
are
involved in compensation (i.e. which components of en-
ergy balance are responsible)?
Components of energy balance
Energy intake
Cross-sectional observations.
Omission of breakfast
results in an energy intake deficit at the beginning of
the day relative to breakfast consumption. Whether
this deficit is maintained will depend on the existence/
magnitude of compensatory feeding throughout the
remainder
of
the
day.
Cross-sectional
evidence
predominantly suggests lower energy intake in those
that skip breakfast(16–19), with a recent within person
analysis from The National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey showing that energy intake is
1033·4 kJ (247 (95 % CI 121, 373) kcal) lower for
men and 782·4 kJ (187 (95 % CI 121, 253) kcal) lower
for women on days when breakfast was omitted (both
P < 0·001)(20). However, this observation has not been
consistent across all studies(3), with work categorising
individuals by graded breakfast frequency reporting
no difference despite varying category definitions(2,4,21).
Acute laboratory studies.
Experimental research has
examined energy intake in both tightly-controlled acute
settings in the laboratory and with chronic exposure to
different morning feeding interventions under free-living
conditions (i.e. people studied in their usual environment).
The nature of laboratory investigations allows precise
control and measurement of actual intake, yet it is that
same tight control and elimination of external influences
that presents a limitation when generalising to ‘real world’
behaviours(22). However, laboratory investigations allow
measurement of other relevant variables such as concurrent
metabolic measurements, subjective responses and appetite
regulatory
hormones,
which
can
provide
valuable
mechanistic insight(23). The majority of appetite regulatory
hormones previously measured are related to satiety and
satiation (e.g. peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), glucagon-
like peptide-1, leptin) but ghrelin acts as an appetite
stimulant(24). As would be expected, there are clear
differences
between
morning
fasting
and
breakfast
consumption during the morning, with a postprandial
reduction in ghrelin and increased PYY in response to
breakfast
consumption(25,26),
thus
reflecting
an
anorexigenic response evidenced by subjective measures of
appetite, as recently reviewed in this Journal(27).
Lunchtime feeding also elicits a PYY response that
persists throughout the afternoon(25,26), suggesting that
this hormone reflects total cumulative intake as opposed
to the energy content of the most recent meal. In con-
trast, both Clayton et al.(28) and our recent studies in
lean(25) and obese(26) individuals suggest that, paradoxic-
ally, acylated ghrelin remains elevated during the after-
noon in those that have consumed a carbohydrate-rich
breakfast and lunch. This may be related to the reduced
insulinaemic response to the lunchtime meal due to the
second-meal effect(29). While these findings for hormonal
appetite regulatory mechanisms and results of subjective
appetite assessments are informative, it is important to
acknowledge that numerous factors contribute to appe-
tite regulation(30). We have also shown in obese indivi-
duals that the pattern of appetite regulatory hormones
and subjective appetite ratings does not necessarily pre-
dict ad libitum intake(26).
Studies investigating acute appetite regulation follow-
ing breakfast omission fall into two main categories:
those that have examined subsequent ad libitum energy
intake following an unbroken overnight fast; and those
where prior to lunch a pre-lunch snack (i.e. preload)
was provided in both breakfast consumption/omission

conditions such that lunch was always consumed in a fed
state. In studies of lean individuals where lunch was con-
sumed ad libitum, most but not all(31,32) indicate energy
intake is increased at the lunch meal, both when
fasted(25,28,31) and after a morning preload(33). Of these
studies, Astbury et al. report the energy deficit from
breakfast was abolished by the increase in energy intake
at lunch. This was not the case in our work in lean indi-
viduals(25), for whom total intake was greater in the
breakfast condition. Notably the breakfast provided by
Astbury et al. was relatively small (about 1046·0 kJ
(250 kcal)) in comparison with those provided in most
other investigations (typically >1673·6 kJ (400 kcal)).
With this in mind, it is a logical suggestion that the en-
ergy content of larger breakfasts is less likely to be
fully compensated in the next meal alone. Studies that
have examined energy intake at both lunch and then din-
ner(28) or meals plus snacks(31) have not revealed
increased intake after morning fasting, refuting the possibil-
ity that further compensation occurs throughout the day.
This view is also supported by findings of similar energy in-
take during evening snacks and meals when comparing
morning feeding v. fasting followed by a standardised
lunch(34).
The balance of evidence from controlled studies there-
fore suggests that breakfast omission results in some com-
pensation at the next meal in lean individuals but that this
next-meal effect is relatively transient with little evidence
of more sustained compensatory feeding mechanisms.
Interestingly, our work in obese individuals indicated simi-
lar energy intake at lunch independent of morning fasting
or breakfast consumption(26). To our knowledge, this isthe
first report of ad libitum intake amongst obese adults after
breakfast omission and subsequent investigations should
attempt to determine if dietary compensation occurs at
later feeding occasions in this population.
Intervention studies.
Intervention studies attempting
to
quantify
the
response
to
chronic
breakfast
consumption or omission do not provide such clear
evidence as laboratory investigations for the effect of
breakfast omission upon energy intake. Early work in
which feeding frequency was regimented throughout the
day suggested that breakfast omission leads to greater
energy intake than breakfast consumption(35). Two
recent studies both from the same research group using
similar cross-over designs of 1-week duration provide
further data in this regard. In the first investigation,
Halsey et al.(36) reported no difference in energy intake
when
participants
either
fasted
or
consumed
an
ad libitum high-carbohydrate breakfast under supervised
laboratory conditions. In a subsequent investigation,
participants were asked to consume a freely chosen
breakfast within 1 h of waking for 1 week, relative to
fasting until midday; omission of breakfast reduced daily
energy intake by 669·4 kJ (160 kcal) relative to a mean
energy intake of about 1673·6–2092·0 kJ (400–500 kcal)
prior to midday when breakfast was consumed(37).
Our recent investigations did not impose any dietary
limitations on the participants in either group other
than
maintaining
the morning fast until noon or
consuming ≥2928·8 kJ (700 kcal) by 11.00 hours, with
at least half of this consumed within 2 h of waking(9).
In lean individuals we found evidence for limited dietary
compensation, with the breakfast group consuming
2255·1 kJ/d (539 (95 % CI 157, 920) kcal/d) more than
those in the fasting group(14). However, in the obese cohort
energy intake was not significantly different between the
breakfast and fasting groups, with those assigned break-
fast intake consuming 1414·1 kJ/d (338 (95 % CI −313,
988) kcal/d) more(15). This finding in obese individuals is
consistent with the findings of Reeves et al.(37), where the
difference between breakfast and fasting groups was a
pooled effect of lean (about 1108·7 kJ (265 kcal) higher)
and obese individuals (about 251·04 kJ (60 kcal) higher),
suggestive that obese individuals may compensate more
for a morning energy deficit than lean individuals under
free-living conditions. Interestingly, in our experiments
the same obese individuals undertook both the acute in-
vestigation described earlier (where there was no compen-
sation observed at lunch) and the free-living assessments
(where there was no difference in daily intake between
groups)(15,26). This is in contrast to the equivalent lean
individuals who displayed limited compensation for
breakfast omission both inside and outside the labora-
tory(14,25). The discord between these two groups of indivi-
duals suggests either that lean and obese people respond
differently to the study designs employed or that energy in-
take may be more strongly influenced by environmental
factors with increasing adiposity(38). For example, the en-
ergy intake compensation evident in the obese cohort may
be due to food choices and frequency, as opposed to the
quantity consumed at single homogenous meals provided
in an artificial laboratory setting.
As might be expected, the data from free-living investi-
gations are inherently more varied than controlled labora-
tory investigations and the limitations of self-reported
energy intake have recently been detailed elsewhere(39).
While these factors contribute towards systematic and ran-
dom error and so impact both validity and reliability, there
is little reason to believe that comparisons between experi-
mental groups would be systematically biased by such lim-
itations(7). Nonetheless, methods to assess diet remain
challenging under free-living conditions and there are cur-
rently no viable alternatives to dietary records in some
form if specific nutrient profiles and/or feeding patterns
are of interest. However, from a pure energy-balance per-
spective, it is possible to estimate total energy intake with
relative accuracy using the intake-balance method(40,41),
which exploits the energy-balance equation to derive en-
ergy entering the system as the sum of the change in energy
storage and objectively measured energy expenditure(42).
The latter may itself be responsive to altered feeding pat-
terns and the following sections will addressthis possibility
with specific reference to each individual component of en-
ergy expenditure.

starvation and hypoenergetic dieting(44–46) but evidence
for a modifying effect of chronic morning feeding pattern
upon RMR is not apparent. Three past studies have mea-
sured changes in RMR in response to a sustained morning
feeding intervention(35,47,48). Of these, Schlundt et al.(47)
demonstrated that weight loss induced by caloric restriction
in obese women resulted in similar reductions in RMR
whether consuming breakfast or fasting during the morn-
ing. In accordance, the 2-week crossover intervention of
Farshchi et al. found no difference in RMR (or weight/
body composition) following breakfast consumption or
skipping regimens in lean women(35). In a crossover study
design involving groups of lean and overweight individuals,
1 week of breakfast consumption or fasting until noon also
had no effect upon RMR(48).
The results of our 6-week interventions in both lean(14)
and obese(15) individuals over 6 weeks of daily breakfast
or morning fasting indicated that RMR was unaffected
by morning feeding pattern (all groups stable within
62·8 kJ/d (15 kcal/d)). Therefore, the evidence uniformly
shows that consistently extending the overnight fast does
not directly affect RMR beyond the predicted change
associated
with
possible
changes
in
body
mass/
composition.
Diet-induced thermogenesis
Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) is the smallest compo-
nent of energy expenditure under most circumstances and
reflects the obligatory energy expended for the processing
and digestion of food. Different macronutrients induce
varying levels of thermogenesis(49,50), but DIT is only
ever a fraction of the energy content of the foods ingested
and typically only about 10 % of intake when consuming
a normal mixed diet(51). Only one intervention study has
examined the effect of a sustained morning feeding inter-
vention on DIT, with no effect on the thermic effect of a
mixed macronutrient test drink after breakfast skipping
or consumption for 2 weeks(35).
There is some evidence that DIT is greater in the
morning than later in the day(52,53) and the thermogenic
effect of breakfast is necessarily greater than morning
fasting. Indeed, when consuming breakfast and an ad
libitum lunch, both lean and obese participants expend
greater energy through DIT during the morning and
afternoon than when omitting breakfast (276·1 (SD
138·1) kJ (66 (SD33) kcal) v. 205·0 (SD 121·3) kJ (49 (SD
29) kcal) in lean and 284·5 (SD 125·5) kJ (68 (SD 33)
kcal) v. 167·4 (SD 96·2) kJ (40 (SD 23) kcal) in obese;
Chowdhury et al., unpublished results). In studies
where a fixed lunch meal has been provided following
morning fasting/feeding, DIT during the afternoon was
greater following breakfast(34) or not different relative
to fasting when measured 1 and 4 h after lunch(28).
Where energy intake has been matched across 24 h fol-
lowing breakfast omission by increasing intake at subse-
quent meals, no difference in 24 h energy expenditure
was observed(54). This suggests little modifying effect of
morning feeding pattern on DIT. Future studies should
determine the effect of chronic breakfast omission upon
DIT in response to feeding (i.e. a chronic adaptation in
the acute response). However, any potential effect of
breakfast consumption per se on overall DIT will be
quantitatively small and inexorably outweighed by the
energy intake required to elicit that DIT.
Physical activity thermogenesis
Of the components contributing to total energy expend-
iture, physical activity thermogenesis is undoubtedly
the most modifiable component yet has received surpris-
ingly little attention in the literature regarding breakfast.
Higher physical activity levels assessed by questionnaire
are cross-sectionally associated with regular breakfast
consumption(1–3,21,55–57). However, this relationship has
not been explained by causal data from experimental
studies, with the few that are available having employed
a wide variety of methodologies of varied sensitivity and
specificity. Several studies have investigated the effect of
varying feeding frequencies upon overall energy expend-
iture measured using a whole body calorimeter(58–60),
which understandably places severe restrictions upon
natural physical activity patterns that might be respon-
sive to breakfast outside the laboratory.
Other past studies have attempted to quantify aspects
of physical activity behaviour in response to breakfast in
particular or altered daily meal frequency in general
using a variety of approaches. Physical movements
have been estimated using hip-worn monitors, ped-
ometers or accelerometers but have failed to detect any
difference in step counts during 1 week of either break-
fast or fasting(36,48) or any difference in accelerometer
counts when comparing a three-meal feeding pattern
with a single evening-meal for 8 weeks(61). However, nat-
ural adjustments in overall activity may have been
masked in the latter study because participants were
‘encouraged to maintain their normal exercise through-
out the day’. In addition, such measurement tools may
also lack both reliability and sensitivity when applied
to subtle changes across all aspects of physical activity
thermogenesis(62). While the issues of reliability and sen-
sitivity have been overcome using doubly-labelled water
to verify no difference in total energy expenditure be-
tween a two- v. seven-meal daily feeding pattern(63),
that finding is neither specific to breakfast or physical ac-
tivity thermogenesis per se, nor does the technique reveal
temporal patterns of activity.
We employed combined heart-rate accelerometry as a
validated tool to quantify physical activity thermogenesis
on a minute-by-minute basis under free-living conditions
in response to our daily breakfast v. fasting intervention.
This instrument is particularly sensitive to the low-
to-moderate intensity, spontaneous lifestyle activities
that we hypothesised might be most responsive to break-
fast(9,62). Our investigation in lean individuals demon-
strated that daily physical activity thermogenesis was
substantially greater amongst those consuming breakfast
than those fasting (1849·3 (95% CI 142·3, 3560·6) kJ/d
(442 (95% CI 34, 851) kcal/d)), with a particular differ-
ence between groups apparent for the morning period
and for light intensity activities(14). The obese individuals
subsequently studied were less active overall and did not

display such a difference between groups in total daily
physical activity thermogenesis (1138·0 (95% CI 1309·6,
4133·8) kJ/d (272 (95% CI −313, 988) kcal/d)) although,
like their lean counterparts, an effect on morning energy
expenditure was apparent (786·6 (95% CI 167·4, 1401·6)
kJ/d (188 (95% CI 40, 335) kcal/d))(15). This suggests that
modifying feeding patterns can affect physical activity,
with the most pronounced response during the time per-
iod of energy restriction/breakfast consumption. The rea-
sons for this are not immediately clear but might be
related to perceptions of lethargy, expectations relating
to physical activity readiness or that reduced availability
of exogenous substrate and/or systemic metabolites may
limit engagement in non-essential physical exertion.
Taken collectively, these observations that physical ac-
tivity levels are lower in response to fasting begin to ex-
plain why a resolution to start skipping breakfast may
not predict the degree of weight loss one might expect.
The shaping of our genome prior to the agricultural revo-
lution ensured that individuals evolved mechanisms to
protect against energy deficit during natural fed–fasted
cycles on a daily basis (i.e. when almost every meal
required initial ‘investment’ of energy). In this sense, it
might be better to express the energy-balance equation
not
as
Balance = Intake − Expenditure
but
instead
Balance = −Expenditure + Intake. The net result is un-
changed but this serves as a reminder that, in terms of
survival, our investment of energy comes first and is inev-
itable, whereas food availability/procurement is uncer-
tain and may be zero.
Strategies designed to improve human health by target-
ing energy balance must therefore integrate an appreci-
ation of how compensatory feedback mechanisms can
operate to defend against energy deficit. Conserving en-
ergy via reduced physical activity can be effective in the
short term, but may not favour survival during a sustained
food shortage, in which case more sedentary behaviours
might be selected-out relative to the more proactive ap-
proach of competing for what limited resources are avail-
able early in the post-absorptive period. It therefore
remains a possibility that more extreme or sustained ex-
posure to extended daily fasting resulting in a chronically
hypoenergetic diet could stimulate increased spontaneous
physical activities, similar to the starvation-induced
hyperactivity noted in rodents and patients with anor-
exia(64). Of course, these elegantly evolved compensatory
mechanisms have become somewhat obsolete (for most)
in modern societies where food procurement is largely in-
dependent of any up-front investment of energy(65). An ef-
fective intervention today will therefore need to target
both sides of the energy-balance equation (e.g. diet and
physical activity); hence, the following section will con-
sider the arguably more natural scenario in which fasting
is superimposed against a background of physical activity
and/or exercise.
Exercise–fasting interactions
An important distinction should be made between phys-
ical
activity
thermogenesis
and
exercise-induced
thermogenesis. Whilst both have an end result of increas-
ing energy expenditure, the distinguishing factor is that
the latter is defined by having a purpose. Accordingly,
if structured exercise was already planned for as part of
an individual’s morning, then this is likely to prohibit
the effect of breakfast consumption on physical activity
thermogenesis, since energy expenditure is prescribed.
The question then arises, what are the effects of breakfast
consumption on metabolism for the morning exerciser?
The acute responses of exercise metabolism to prior
feeding are well characterised. Total energy expenditure
is almost entirely determined by the duration and inten-
sity of the exercise bout, but substrate selection can be
drastically shifted by nutritional status. Consumption
of a mixed-macronutrient breakfast increases carbohy-
drate oxidation and suppresses fat oxidation during exer-
cise(32,66), which is largely driven by the type and
quantity of carbohydrate in the meal(67). This is predom-
inantly due to the insulin-induced suppression of plasma
NEFA availability; insulin concentrations after a mixed-
macronutrient carbohydrate-rich breakfast remain ele-
vated sufficient to all but maximally suppress palmitate
appearance(68). Interestingly, the breakfast-induced sup-
pression of fatty acid availability during exercise is not
due to a reduction in lipolysis (at least in the subcutane-
ous adipose tissue depot) but rather to an increase in
re-esterification(69). In addition, if the breakfast has a
particularly high glycaemic index, then an elevated pre-
exercise muscle glycogen concentration(70) can also con-
tribute to a further suppression of fat oxidation in both
men(71) and women(72).
The omission of breakfast prior to exercise (or delay-
ing breakfast consumption until after exercise) also
appears to have unique consequences for acute whole-
body substrate balance. Physical exercise does not invoke
the same acute energy intake response to breakfast omis-
sion/delay presented earlier (i.e. energy intake at lunch
and dinner is largely either unaltered(32,73,74) or does
not fully compensate for breakfast omission(28)). Instead,
the increase in energy expenditure due to exercise, com-
bined with the shift in substrate utilisation towards greater
lipid oxidation with breakfast omission, results in a less
positive (more negative) fat balance in both lean(32) and
overweight men(74). This has also been observed over a
full 24-h period with room calorimetry and fixed energy in-
take(75). Given the importance of endogenous carbohy-
drate stores for exercise tolerance(76–78), the preservation
of whole-body carbohydrate balance in the presence of a
negative fat balance(32,74) could be an attractive metabolic
milieu for the regular exerciser.
The chronic effect of breakfast–exercise interactions is
much less clear. An emerging theme in exercise physi-
ology is the augmentation of endurance-type training
adaptations through manipulation of substrate availabil-
ity. Methods such as multiple bouts of exercise(79,80),
reductions in dietary carbohydrate intake and timing of
dietary carbohydrate intake(81,82) all serve to reduce en-
dogenous or exogenous carbohydrate availability, conse-
quently elevating fatty acid availability. Whilst (to the
authors knowledge) no studies are available on the effect
of breakfast on endurance training adaptation per se,

 Proceedings of the Nutrition Society
there is evidence to suggest that consumption of a
carbohydrate-rich breakfast prior to training, in addition
to carbohydrate intake during every exercise training ses-
sion can impair some endurance-type training adapta-
tions. Specifically, compared to extending the overnight
fast until after exercise, carbohydrate consumption before
and during exercise can attenuate and/or abolish the
increases in VO2max
(83) glucose tolerance, insulin sensitiv-
ity, resting muscle glycogen concentrations and GLUT4
content(84). It should be noted however, that these effects
are not consistent across all studies of fasted-state exercise
training(85).
The energy balance and body composition responses
to regular exercise training with breakfast consump-
tion/omission are currently unknown. It therefore
remains to be seen whether the Nobel Laureate and
Exercise Physiologist A.V. Hill had a firm rationale
for running a mile every morning prior to having
breakfast(86).
Health outcomes
Much of the work examining different morning feeding
patterns as described in the present review has focused
on components of energy balance. Considering the sever-
ity of the growing issue of obesity(87) and the general pre-
occupation of the public/media with the effects of diet
upon weight, this is not surprising. However, it is import-
ant to keep in mind that the primary reason for the study of
energy balance is not as an endpoint in itself, but because
of our interest in the potential impact of an individual’s en-
ergy (im)balance upon factors that may then affect their
health. While chronic energy (im)balance is potentially
an important contributor to negative health outcomes,
specific components of energy balance such as physical
activity can also impact disease and mortality risk inde-
pendent of net energy surplus/deficit or changes in adipos-
ity(88,89). Therefore, it is perfectly plausible that the
omission/consumption of breakfast might affect markers
of health independent of energy balance.
While there is a wealth of evidence for increased dis-
ease risk in those that omit breakfast(1–4), randomised
controlled trials that have provided causal mechanisms
to explain these observations remain very limited. In
the two prior studies where health markers have been
measured, Stote et al.(61) report increased lipoproteins
relative to a three-meal pattern (total, HDL and LDL)
when individuals adhered to a one-meal a day regimen.
In a less extreme model, Farshchi et al.(35) report when
delaying morning intake until 10.30 hours each morning
for 2 weeks that total and LDL-cholesterol and insulin
response to a test drink increased (although other mea-
sures of insulin sensitivity remained unchanged), relative
to a reduction when consuming breakfast daily. Our re-
cent studies have extended this evidence by measuring
several markers related to CVD risk and metabolic con-
trol. In lean individuals, only a modest increase in glu-
cose variability in those fasting during the afternoon/
evening was detected(14), with no effects for 24 h gly-
caemic
control
detected
in
obese
individuals(15).
However, there was an interaction effect for insulinaemic
response to an oral glucose tolerance test in this popula-
tion, with a reduction in those consuming breakfast rela-
tive to an increase in those fasting. Across both groups,
the majority of health markers were unaffected by either
regimen. Therefore, it appears that any effects of chronic
morning fasting upon health in healthy individuals are ei-
ther non-existent or not detectable over the relatively
short time period examined. Evidence for a potential ef-
fect upon insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control is evi-
dent in the work of our group and others(14,15,35), and
tallies somewhat with reports of improved glycaemic
control with greater breakfast quantity in type-2 dia-
betics(90,91). However, considering that not all measures
of metabolic control demonstrated a deterioration with
extended morning fasting in healthy individuals, it
appears that any effects are subtle at best. Future studies
could provide further insight by employing interventions
of longer durations, over which potential effects upon
markers of health might be more apparent.
Conclusions
The evidence reviewed suggests that breakfast omission
affects some components of energy balance much more
than others. There is no evidence to suggest that breakfast
consumption per se affects RMR, or DIT of subsequent
meals or over the day as a whole. Evidence that breakfast
affects energy intake is compelling for laboratory studies,
with the majority of studies showing energetic compensa-
tion at the next meal, but not sufficient to eliminate the
deficit from morning fasting. In addition, designs where
afternoon/evening feeding has been allowed do not dem-
onstrate sustained compensation for breakfast omission.
Experiments outside the laboratory understandably pro-
duce more varied results, with the balance of evidence sug-
gesting that energy intake is either lower or similar when
omitting breakfast. Our work in lean and obese groups
would suggest that there are differences between groups
in energy intake responses based on adiposity. The body
of evidence taken together supports the concept that, in
general, energy intake is reduced when breakfast is omit-
ted, with limited support for the popular perception of
greater overall energy intake after breakfast omission.
While much work has investigated energy intake in re-
sponse to breakfast omission, there is a severe lack of
studies investigating the most modifiable component of
energy expenditure-physical activity energy expenditure,
with some studies limited by measurement issues. Our
work in both lean and obese individuals suggests that
breakfast omission may lower physical activity energy ex-
penditure, particularly during the morning, although this
needs confirmation and the potential reasons for this
phenomenon remain to be established. The majority of
studies conducted to date have been of relatively short
duration, but those that have examined the effect of
breakfast omission upon body weight do not support
the strongly established public perceptions and correl-
ational evidence that omission of breakfast is associated
with weight-gain.

Future investigations should focus on concurrently
measuring all aspects of energy balance, to provide a ful-
ler understanding of the effects of breakfast omission
upon individual components (and importantly the inter-
action of these components). Longer-term studies are
needed to conclusively establish the effects of breakfast
omission
upon
health
markers,
with
more
studies
required examining overweight and obese populations.
Breakfast may or may not be the most important meal
of the day, but it is certainly an important meal to inves-
tigate further.
