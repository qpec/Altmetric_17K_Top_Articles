On July 13, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). 
Zika virus belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family 
Flaviviridae; it is transmitted to humans primarily through 
the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito (e.g., Ae. aegypti 
and Ae. albopictus) (1). Zika virus has been identified as a 
cause of congenital microcephaly and other serious brain 
defects (2). As of June 30, 2016, CDC had issued travel 
notices for 49 countries and U.S. territories across much 
of the Western hemisphere (3), including Brazil, where the 
2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games (Games of the XXXI 
Olympiad, also known as Rio 2016; Games) will be hosted 
in Rio de Janeiro in August and September 2016. During the 
Games, mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission is expected 
to be low because August and September are winter months 
in Brazil, when cooler and drier weather typically reduces 
mosquito populations (4). CDC conducted a risk assessment 
to predict those countries susceptible to ongoing Zika virus 
transmission resulting from introduction by a single traveler to 
the Games. Whereas all countries are at risk for travel-associated 
importation of Zika virus, CDC estimated that 19 countries 
currently not reporting Zika outbreaks have the environmental 
conditions and population susceptibility to sustain mosquito-
borne transmission of Zika virus if a case were imported from 
infection at the Games. For 15 of these 19 countries, travel to 
Rio de Janeiro during the Games is not estimated to increase 
substantially the level of risk above that incurred by the usual 
aviation travel baseline for these countries. The remaining four 
countries, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, and Yemen, are unique 
in that they do not have a substantial number of travelers to 
any country with local Zika virus transmission, except for 
anticipated travel to the Games. These four countries will be 
represented by a projected, combined total of 19 athletes (plus 
a projected delegation of about 60 persons), a tiny fraction 
of the 350,000–500,000 visitors expected at the Games.* 
Overall travel volume to the Games represents a very small 
fraction (<0.25%) of the total estimated 2015 travel volume to 
Zika-affected countries,† highlighting the unlikely scenario that 
Zika importation would be solely attributable to travel to the 
Games. To prevent Zika virus infection and its complications 
among athletes and visitors to the Games and importation of 
Zika virus into countries that could sustain local transmission, 
pregnant women should not travel to the Games, mosquito 
bites should be avoided while traveling and for 3 weeks after 
returning home, and measures should be taken to prevent 
sexual transmission (Box).
To assess the country-specific risk for importation and sus-
tained, local mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus from 
travel to the Games, CDC constructed a stepwise model. The 
model began with the 206 countries and numbers of athletes 
planning to participate in the Games, as of June 30, 2016 (5). 
Each country was assessed on five criteria: 1) no active CDC 
travel notice (as of June 30, 2016) reporting local Zika virus 
transmission (3); 2) modeled probability of Ae. aegypti pres-
ence, drawn from a data set of 20,000 observed occurrences 
during 1960–2014 (6) and fitted to climate norms for the 
months of August and September when travelers would return 
to their home country; 3) predicted dengue epidemic potential 
(7), such that the environmental and population conditions 
could support mosquito-borne disease spread from a single 
point of introduction; 4) lack of historic Zika virus circulation 
as evidenced by historic serosurveys, Zika virus detection, or 
exported Zika virus disease cases to exclude any country in 
which Zika virus might already be endemic (8); and 5) ranking 
countries by the estimated aviation travel passenger-journeys 
during August 2016 from Rio de Janeiro. Combined, the first 
four criteria estimate susceptibility to ongoing Zika transmis-
sion from introduction by a single traveler to the Games or to 
any other country with ongoing Zika virus transmission during 
August–September. The fifth criterion considers the probability 
that ongoing transmission could be the result of travel to the 
Games alone. In a stepwise manner, CDC successively excluded 
countries that did not meet the preceding criteria (Table 1).
* According to the Brazilian Tourism Board (Embratur), approximately 350,000–
500,000 international visitors are expected at the Games (http://www.embratur.

MMWR / July 22, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 28
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Research based on the previous four summer Olympics 
has indicated that travel during the Olympics typically does 
not exceed baseline travel volume patterns to the host city 
(Kamran Khan, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St. Michael’s 
Hospital, Toronto, Canada, personal communication, June 
2016). Therefore, for most countries, the number of passenger-
journeys from Rio de Janeiro during August 2016 was assumed 
to be approximately the same as the number of journeys 
occurring during August 2015. Modeled data were used to 
estimate the number of passenger-journeys originating from 
Rio de Janeiro during August 2015.§ For countries without 
documented passenger-journeys from Rio de Janeiro in August 
2015, the estimated Olympic delegation size¶ was used as a 
proxy for travel volume during August 2016.** Delegation 
size was determined by viewing video footage of the Parade of 
Nations from the London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony 
and comparing the number of persons observed with the 
known number of athletes; this is likely an underestimation 
given that some delegates might not participate in the parade 
(5). Finally, CDC calculated the estimated aviation travel 
from Rio de Janeiro during August 2016 as the proportion of 
each country’s total travel to all Zika-affected countries dur-
ing 2015.†† For example, there were 36,923,504 passenger-
journeys to the United States from all Zika-affected countries 
and U.S. territories in 2015 and 38,798 journeys from Rio de 
Janeiro during August 2015; thus, the proportion of estimated 
U.S. travel from Rio de Janeiro for the Games, relative to that 
of all Zika-affected countries is 0.11%. CDC assumed that 
any country whose estimated proportion of travel to Rio de 
Janeiro among all travel to Zika transmission areas exceeded 
5% was at risk for ongoing transmission of Zika attributable 
to the Games.
Among the 206 countries competing in the Games, 39 have 
CDC travel notices indicating ongoing Zika virus outbreaks 
or epidemics (Table 1). Among the remaining 167 countries, 
148 were not considered to be at risk for the following reasons: 
74 did not have a predicted presence of Ae. aegypti in August–
September, 51 did not also have a predicted high dengue 
epidemic potential, and 23 also had evidence of previous Zika 
virus transmission. Thus, 19 countries currently not reporting 
Zika outbreaks that are participating in the Games met all the 
risk criteria for susceptibility to ongoing Zika transmission 
from introduction by a single traveler to the Olympics. For 
15 of these countries, estimated aviation travel from Rio de 
Janeiro in August 2016 compared with total aviation travel 
from all countries with local Zika virus transmission in 2015 
was 0.01%–3.25% (Table 2). Four countries (Chad, Djibouti, 
Eritrea, and Yemen) were estimated to have >19% of travel 
from Rio de Janeiro in August 2016 compared with the overall 
aviation travel from all countries with local Zika transmission.
Discussion
This risk assessment reflects an unlikely scenario, given 
that it will be winter in Rio de Janeiro during the Games and 
mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus is predicted to be 
low. Nineteen countries participating in the Games have no 
evidence of ongoing or previous Zika virus transmission but 
do have the environmental and population conditions that 
could support ongoing mosquito-borne Zika virus transmis-
sion after introduction from a single traveler after the Games. 
For 15 of the countries, travel to Rio de Janeiro during the 
Games is not estimated to increase substantially the level of 
risk above that incurred by the usual aviation travel baseline 
for these countries. Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, and Yemen have

BOX. CDC prevention recommendations for athletes and visitors to 
Rio de Janeiro, and other areas where Zika virus is circulating
• Pregnant women should not travel to any area where 
Zika virus transmission is ongoing.
• T
ravelers should take protective measures, including use of 
insect repellent, to prevent mosquito bites both during 
travel and for 3 weeks after returning to their home country. 
Such measures include wearing long-sleeved shirts and long 
pants; staying in places with air conditioning and window 
and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside; sleeping 
under a mosquito bed net, and using insect repellents with 
active ingredients (e.g., DEET).
• Travelers should prevent possible sexual transmission 
while at the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games and 
after returning home by correctly using condoms every 
time they have sex or by abstaining from sex. Males 
should use condoms for at least 8 weeks after travel or, 
if symptomatic for Zika virus infection, for 6 months 
from the start of symptoms.
• After returning from a country with Zika virus transmission, 
men with pregnant partners should use condoms or not 
have sex for the duration of the pregnancy.
• Couples who want to try to get pregnant after attending 
the Olympic and Paralympic Games should wait at least 
8 weeks, and 6 months if the male partner has 
symptomatic Zika virus infection.
 
†† For countries lacking total aviation travel from Rio de Janeiro in August 2015, 
estimated size of delegation was added to the aviation travel from all Zika-
affected countries in 2015.

 § For countries without total aviation travel from Rio de Janeiro in August, 2015, estimated size of delegation was added to aviation travel from all Zika-affected 
countries in 2015.
 ¶ Calculated as aviation from Rio de Janeiro in August 2015 divided by aviation travel from all Zika-affected countries in 2015. For countries with no documented 
aviation passenger-journeys in August 2015, the estimated Olympic delegation size was substituted as the numerator in place of passenger-journeys.

an additional, unique factor: apart from projected travel to the 
Games, these countries do not have substantial travel to any 
country with local Zika virus transmission. With the excep-
tion of these four countries, the Games do not pose a unique 
or substantive risk for mosquito-borne transmission of Zika 
virus in excess of that posed by non-Games travel.
To create a model based on “worst-case scenarios,” CDC 
identified five assumptions. First, CDC assumed that Zika 
transmission would be ongoing during the winter months of 
August and September in Rio de Janeiro. Historically, winter 
months are low season for mosquito-borne disease transmission 
in Rio de Janeiro (4). Second, it was assumed that preventive 
measures, such as wearing long sleeves and pants or using insect 
repellent, would not be used or would be ineffective, and that 
all visitors would have an equal risk for exposure to Zika virus. 
Third, visitors who were infected were assumed to be viremic 
upon return from the Games. Fourth, infected visitors were 
assumed to return immediately to their home country with no 
extended stays in other countries. Fifth, it was assumed that 
visitors would not employ precautions to prevent mosquito 
bites upon return to their home country.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, the aviation travel data set comprised modeled 
estimates of passenger-journeys from 2015, not actual counts 
of travelers, and aviation travel data might have changed in 
2016. Second, delegation sizes were estimated using a simple 
formula based on the projected numbers of athletes. However, 
the planned participating countries and numbers of athletes 
reflect data available as of June 30, 2016 (5) when Olympic 
qualifying events were ongoing and the numbers of athletes 
had not been finalized. Chad, Mauritania, and Yemen had 
not completed qualifications, so the number of athletes from 
the 2012 London Games was used to estimate the number of 
athletes for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games. Third, analyses 
were completed considering only the primary Zika virus vector, 
Ae. Aegypti, and not Ae. Albopictus, which is less commonly 
associated with transmission; however, this did not affect the 
results, because none of the countries where Ae. albopictus 
but not Ae. aegypti is present met all four risk criteria. Fourth, 
assessment included all estimated passenger-journeys from 
Rio de Janeiro in August 2016, although many of these pas-
senger journeys might be unrelated to the Olympics. Finally, 
the analysis does not estimate actual risk, which would be 
expected to be related to travel volume (and therefore low for 
countries with low travel volume), but instead estimates pro-
portionate changes in risk that could occur because of travel 
during the Games.
Global travel has resulted in spread of Zika virus across much 
of the Western Hemisphere (9). Substantial and continuous 
travel has occurred between most of the countries participating 
in the Games and the 49 countries or U.S. territories with CDC 
Zika Travel Notices. Global connectivity creates a pervasive 
risk for importation of Zika virus by travelers from areas with 
local transmission. These findings support implementation 
of public health interventions that increase ongoing readiness 
and response capabilities to prevent Zika virus transmission, 
including educating travelers regarding prevention of infection 
and transmission. CDC recommends that pregnant women 
not travel to any area with ongoing Zika virus transmission. 
Pregnant women with male partners who travel to Zika trans-
mission areas should correctly use condoms every time they 
have sex or abstain from sex during pregnancy. Athletes and 
visitors to Rio de Janeiro and other Zika transmission areas 
should follow precautions to prevent exposure to the virus. 
Specifically, all delegation members and visitors should take 
rigorous steps to reduce the likelihood of mosquito bites (e.g. 
use insect repellent) both during the Games and within the 
three weeks after they return to their home country from an 
area with ongoing Zika transmission (Box). Efforts to enhance 
global health security to prevent, detect, and respond to Zika 
virus, as well as other emerging infections, require a sustained 
international commitment at all levels of government, the 
private sector, and civil society.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
High travel volume globally has disseminated Zika virus broadly 
across much of the Region of the Americas since May 2015, 
highlighting the major role of globalization in rapidly spreading 
this emerging virus.
What is added by this report?
All countries are at risk for travel-associated importation of 
Zika virus. CDC identified 19 countries currently not reporting 
Zika outbreaks but with environmental conditions and 
population susceptibility that could sustain mosquito-borne 
transmission of Zika virus during August–September. Among 
these, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, and Yemen have risk uniquely 
attributable to their travel related to the 2016 Olympic and 
Paralympic Games (Games), because these four countries do 
not have substantial non-Games travel to any countries with 
local Zika virus transmission.
What are the implications for public health practice?
With the exception of four countries, attendance at the Games 
does not pose a unique or substantive risk for mosquito-borne 
transmission of Zika virus in excess of that posed by non-Games 
travel. Efforts to enhance global health security to prevent, 
detect, and respond to Zika virus, as well as other emerging 
infections, require a sustained international commitment at all 
levels of government, the private sector, and civil society.
