SUMMARY
The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) presents a revised operational clas-
sification of seizure types. The purpose of such a revision is to recognize that some sei-
zure types can have either a focal or generalized onset, to allow classification when the
onset is unobserved, to include some missing seizure types, and to adopt more trans-
parent names. Because current knowledge is insufficient to form a scientifically based
classification, the 2017 Classification is operational (practical) and based on the 1981
Classification, extended in 2010. Changes include the following: (1) “partial” becomes
“focal”; (2) awareness is used as a classifier of focal seizures; (3) the terms dyscognitive,
simple partial, complex partial, psychic, and secondarily generalized are eliminated;
(4) new focal seizure types include automatisms, behavior arrest, hyperkinetic, auto-
nomic, cognitive, and emotional; (5) atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, and
tonic seizures can be of either focal or generalized onset; (6) focal to bilateral tonic–
clonic seizure replaces secondarily generalized seizure; (7) new generalized seizure
types are absence with eyelid myoclonia, myoclonic absence, myoclonic–atonic,
myoclonic–tonic–clonic; and (8) seizures of unknown onset may have features that can
still be classified. The new classification does not represent a fundamental change, but
allows greater flexibility and transparency in naming seizure types.
KEY WORDS: Classification, Seizures, Focal, Generalized, Epilepsy, Taxonomy.
The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE),
through the Commission for Classification and Terminol-
ogy, has developed a working classification of seizures
and epilepsy. Following the proposed reorganization in
2010,1,2 further clarification has been discussed and feed-
back sought from the community. One area that required
further elucidation was the organization of seizure types.
A Seizure Type Classification Task Force was estab-
lished in 2015 to prepare recommendations for classifica-
tion of seizure types, which are summarized in this
document. A companion document guides the intended
use of the classification.
Descriptions of seizure types date back at least to the
time of Hippocrates. Gastaut3,4 proposed a modern classi-
fication in 1964. Various basic frameworks for seizure
classification can be considered. Manifestations of certain
seizures are age-specific and depend on the maturation of

ILAE POSITION PAPER
 the brain. Previous classifications have been based on
anatomy, with temporal, frontal, parietal, occipital, dien-
cephalic, or brainstem seizures. Modern research changed
our view of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved
and has shown epilepsy to be a network disease and not
only a symptom of local brain abnormalities.5 From a net-
work perspective, seizures could arise in neocortical, tha-
lamocortical, limbic, and brainstem networks. Although
our
understanding
of
seizure
networks
is
evolving
rapidly,6 it is not yet sufficient to serve as a basis for sei-
zure classification. In 1981, an ILAE Commission led by
Dreifuss and Penry7 evaluated hundreds of video–elec-
troencephalography
(EEG)
recordings
of
seizures
to
develop recommendations that divided seizures into those
of partial and generalized onset, simple and complex par-
tial seizures, and various specific generalized seizure
types. This classification remains in widespread use today,
with revisions in terminology and classification of sei-
zures and epilepsy by the ILAE,2,8–14 and with suggested
insights, modifications, and criticisms by others.15–24 We
chose not to develop a classification based solely on
observed behavior—instead, reflecting clinical practice,
the 2017 classification is interpretive, allowing the use of
additional data to classify seizure types.
The intention of the 200112 and 200613 reports on
reclassification was to identify unique diagnostic entities
with etiologic, therapeutic, and prognostic implications,
so that when a syndromic diagnosis could not be made,
the therapy and prognosis would be based on seizure
type. Such a classification would permit grouping of rea-
sonably pure cohorts of patients for discovery of etiolo-
gies, including genetic factors, research into fundamental
mechanisms, involved networks, and clinical trials. The
ILAE Seizure Type Classification Task Force (hereafter
called “the Task Force”) chose to use the phrase “opera-
tional classification,” because it is impossible at this time
to base a classification fully on the science of epilepsy.
In the absence of a full scientific classification, the Task
Force chose to use the basic organization initiated in
1981 and subsequently modified1,2 as a starting point for
the revised operational classification.
Methods
What is a seizure type?
A seizure is defined as “a transient occurrence of signs
and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous
neuronal activity in the brain.”25 It is the clinician’s first task
to determine that an event has the characteristics of a seizure
and not one of the many imitators of seizures.26 The next
step is classification into a seizure type.
The Task Force operationally defines a seizure type as a
useful grouping of seizure characteristics for purposes of
communication in clinical care, teaching, and research.
Mention of a seizure type should bring to mind a specific
entity, albeit sometimes with subcategories and variations
on a theme. Choices must be made by interested stakehold-
ers to highlight groupings of seizure characteristics that are
useful for specific purposes. Such stakeholders include
patients, families, medical professionals, researchers, epi-
demiologists, medical educators, clinical trialists, insurance
payers, regulatory agencies, advocacy groups, and medical
reporters. Operational (practical) groupings can be derived
by those with specific interests. A pharmacologist, for
example, might choose to group seizures by efficacy of
medications. A researcher doing a clinical trial might con-
sider seizures as disabling or nondisabling. A surgeon might
group by anatomy in order to predict the eligibility for and
likely success of surgical therapy. A physician based in an
intensive care unit with predominantly unconscious patients
might group seizures in part by EEG pattern.27 The principal
aim of this classification is to provide a communication
framework for clinical use. Seizure types are relevant to
clinical practice in humans; whereas, it is acknowledged
that seizure types in other species, experimental and natural,
may not be reflected in the proposed classification. One goal
was to make the classification understandable by patients
and families and broadly applicable to all ages, including
neonates. The ILAE Commission on Classification & Ter-
minology recognizes that seizures in the neonate can have
motor manifestations, or alternatively little or no behavioral
manifestations. A separate Neonatal Seizure Task Force is
working to develop a classification of neonatal seizures.
The 2017 seizure classification is not a classification of
electroencephalographic ictal or subclinical patterns. The
guiding principle of the Seizure Type Task Force was
advice from Albert Einstein to “make things as simple as
possible, but no simpler.”
Motivation for change
Adapting to a change in terminology can be effortful and
needs to be motivated by a rationale for change. Seizure
type classification is important for several reasons. First, the
classification becomes a worldwide shorthand form of
Key Points
• The ILAE has constructed a revised classification of
seizure types; the classification is operational and not
based on fundamental mechanisms
• Reasons for revision include clarity of nomenclature,
ability to classify some seizure types as either focal or
generalized, and classification when onset is unknown
• Seizures are divided into those of focal, generalized,
unknown onset, with subcategories of motor, non-
motor, with retained or impaired awareness for focal
seizures

 communication among clinicians caring for people with
epilepsy. Second, the classification allows grouping of
patients for therapies. Some regulatory agencies approve
drugs or devices indicated for specific seizure types. A new
classification should gracefully map to existing indications
for drug or device usage. Third, the seizure type grouping
might provide a useful link to specific syndromes or etiolo-
gies, for example, by noting an association between gelastic
seizures and hypothalamic hamartoma or epileptic spasms
with tuberous sclerosis. Fourth, the classification allows
researchers to better focus their studies on mechanisms of
different seizure types. Fifth, a classification provides words
to patients to describe their disease. Motivations for revising
the 1981 Seizure Classification are listed below.
1 Some seizure types, for example, tonic seizures or epilep-
tic spasms, can have either a focal or generalized onset.
2 Lack of knowledge about the onset makes a seizure
unclassifiable and difficult to discuss with the 1981 sys-
tem.
3 Retrospective seizure descriptions often do not specify a
level
of
consciousness,
and
altered
consciousness,
although central to many seizures, is a complicated con-
cept.
4 Some terms in current use do not have high levels of
community acceptance or public understanding, such as
“psychic,” “partial,” “simple partial,” “complex partial,”
and “dyscognitive.”
5 Some important seizure types are not included.
Results
Classification of seizure types
Figure 1 depicts the basic and Figure 2 depicts the
expanded 2017 seizure classification. The two represent the
same classification, with collapse of the subcategories to
form the basic version. Use of one versus the other depends
on the desired degree of detail. Variations on the individual
seizure theme can be added for focal seizure types according
to level of awareness.
Structure of the classification
The classification chart is columnar, but not hierarchical
(meaning that levels can be skipped), so arrows intention-
ally are omitted. Seizure classification begins with the
determination of whether the initial manifestations of the
seizure are focal or generalized. The onset may be missed or
obscured, in which case the seizure is of unknown onset.
The words “focal” and “generalized” at the start of a seizure
name are assumed to mean of focal or generalized onset.
For focal seizures, the level of awareness optionally may
be included in the seizure type. Awareness is only one
potentially important feature of a seizure, but awareness is
of sufficient practical importance to justify using it as a
seizure classifier. Retained awareness means that the per-
son is aware of self and environment during the seizure,
even if immobile. A focal aware seizure (with or without
any subsequent classifiers) corresponds to the prior term
“simple partial seizure.” A focal impaired awareness
seizure (with or without any subsequent classifiers) corre-
sponds to the prior term “complex partial seizure.”
Impaired awareness during any part of the seizure renders
it a focal impaired awareness seizure. In addition, focal sei-
zures are subgrouped as those with motor and nonmotor
signs and symptoms at the onset. If both motor and nonmo-
tor signs are present at the seizure start, the motor signs
will usually dominate, unless non-motor (e.g., sensory)
symptoms and signs are prominent.
Focal aware or impaired awareness seizures optionally
may be further characterized by one of the listed motor
onset or nonmotor onset symptoms, reflecting the first
prominent sign or symptom in the seizure, for example,
focal impaired awareness automatism seizure. Seizures
should be classified by the earliest prominent motor onset or
nonmotor onset feature, except that a focal behavior arrest
seizure is one for which cessation of activity is the dominant
feature throughout the seizure, and any significant impair-
ment of awareness during the course of the seizure causes a
focal seizure to be classified as having impaired awareness.
Classification according to onset has an anatomic basis,

 behavioral basis, justified by the practical importance of
impaired awareness. Both methods of classification are
available and can be used in concert. Brief behavioral arrest
at the start of a seizure often is imperceptible, and so it is not
used as a classifier unless dominant throughout the seizure.
The earliest (anatomic) classifier will not necessarily be the
most significant behavioral feature of a seizure. For exam-
ple, a seizure might start with fear and progress to vigorous
focal clonic activity resulting in falling. This seizure would
still be a focal emotional seizure (with or without impair-
ment of awareness), but free text description of the ensuing
features would be very useful.
A focal seizure name can omit mention of awareness
when awareness is not applicable or unknown, thereby clas-
sifying the seizure directly by motor onset or nonmotor
onset characteristics. The terms motor onset and nonmotor
onset may be omitted when a subsequent term generates an
unambiguous seizure name.
The classification of an individual seizure can stop at any
level: a “focal onset” or “generalized onset” seizure, with no
other elaboration, or a “focal sensory seizure,” “focal motor
seizure,” “focal tonic seizure,” or “focal automatism sei-
zure,” and so on. Additional classifiers are encouraged, and
their use may depend on the experience and purposes of the
person classifying the seizure. The terms focal onset and
generalized onset are for purposes of grouping. No infer-
ence is made that each seizure type exists in both groups;
including absence seizures in the generalized-onset cate-
gory does not imply existence of “focal absence” seizures.
When the primacy of one versus another key symptom or
sign is unclear, the seizure can be classified at a level above
the questionably applicable term with additional descriptors
Figure 2.
The expanded ILAE 2017 operational classification of seizure types. The following clarifications should guide the choice of seizure type.
For focal seizures, specification of level of awareness is optional. Retained awareness means the person is aware of self and environment
during the seizure, even if immobile. A focal aware seizure corresponds to the prior term simple partial seizure. A focal impaired aware-
ness seizure corresponds to the prior term complex partial seizure, and impaired awareness during any part of the seizure renders it a
focal impaired awareness seizure. Focal aware or impaired awareness seizures optionally may further be characterized by one of the
motor-onset or nonmotor-onset symptoms below, reflecting the first prominent sign or symptom in the seizure. Seizures should be clas-
sified by the earliest prominent feature, except that a focal behavior arrest seizure is one for which cessation of activity is the dominant
feature throughout the seizure. A focal seizure name also can omit mention of awareness when awareness is not applicable or unknown
and thereby classify the seizure directly by motor onset or nonmotor-onset characteristics. Atonic seizures and epileptic spasms would
usually not have specified awareness. Cognitive seizures imply impaired language or other cognitive domains or positive features such as
d�
ej�
a vu, hallucinations, illusions, or perceptual distortions. Emotional seizures involve anxiety, fear, joy, other emotions, or appearance of
affect without subjective emotions. An absence is atypical because of slow onset or termination or significant changes in tone supported
by atypical, slow, generalized spike and wave on the EEG. A seizure may be unclassified due to inadequate information or inability to place
the type in other categories. 1Definitions, other seizure types and descriptors are listed in the accompanying paper and glossary of terms.

Operational Classification of Seizure Types
 of seizure semiology relevant to the individual seizure. Any
signs or symptoms of seizures, suggested descriptor terms
as listed in the companion paper or free text descriptions can
optionally be appended to the seizure type as descriptions,
but they do not alter the seizure type.
The seizure type “focal to bilateral tonic–clonic” is a spe-
cial seizure type, corresponding to the 1981 phrase “partial
onset with secondary generalization.” Focal to bilateral
tonic–clonic reflects a propagation pattern of a seizure,
rather than a unitary seizure type, but it is such a common
and important presentation that the separate categorization
was continued. The term “to bilateral” rather than “sec-
ondary generalized” was used to further distinguish this
focal-onset seizure from a generalized-onset seizure. The
term “bilateral” is used for propagation patterns and “gener-
alized” for seizures that engage bilateral networks from
onset.
Seizure activity propagates through brain networks,
sometimes leading to uncertainty about whether an event is
a unitary seizure or a series of multiple seizures starting
from different networks (“multifocal”). A single unifocal
seizure can present with multiple clinical manifestations as
a result of propagation. The clinician will need to determine
(by observation of a continuous evolution or stereotypy
from seizure-to-seizure) whether an event is a single seizure
or a series of different seizures. When a single focal seizure
presents with a sequence of signs and symptoms, then the
seizure is named for the initial prominent sign or symptom,
reflecting the usual clinical practice of identifying the sei-
zure onset focus or network. For example, a seizure begin-
ning with sudden inability to understand language followed
by impaired awareness and clonic left arm jerks would be
classified as a “focal impaired awareness (nonmotor onset)
cognitive seizure” (progressing to clonic left arm jerks).
The terms in parentheses are optional. The formal seizure
type in this example is determined by the cognitive non-
motor onset and presence of altered awareness during any
point of the seizure.
Generalized seizures are divided into motor and non-
motor (absence) seizures. Further subdivisions are similar
to those of the 1981 classification, with the addition of
myoclonic–atonic seizures, common in epilepsy with
myoclonic–atonic
seizures
(Doose
syndrome28),
myoclonic–tonic–clonic seizures common in juvenile myo-
clonic epilepsy,29 myoclonic absence,30 and absence sei-
zures with eyelid myoclonia seen in the syndrome described
by Jeavons and elsewhere.31 Generalized manifestations of
seizures can be asymmetrical, rendering difficult the dis-
tinction from focal-onset seizures. The word “absence” has
a common meaning, but an “absent stare” is not synony-
mous with an absence seizure, since arrest of activity also
occurs in other seizure types.
The 2017 classification allows appending of a limited
number of qualifiers to seizures of unknown onset, in order
to better characterize the seizure. Seizures of unknown onset
may be referred to by the single word “unclassified” or with
additional features, including motor, nonmotor, tonic–clo-
nic, epileptic spasms, and behavior arrest. A seizure type of
unknown onset may later become classified as either of
focal or generalized onset, but any associated behaviors
(e.g., tonic–clonic) of the previously unclassified seizure
will still apply. In this regard, the term “unknown onset” is a
placeholder—not a characteristic of the seizure, but of
ignorance.
Reasons for decisions
The terminology for seizure types is designed to be useful
for communicating the key characteristics of seizures and to
serve as one of the key components of a larger classification
for the epilepsies, which is being developed by a separate
ILAE Classification Task Force. The basic framework of
seizure classification used since 1981 was maintained.
Focal versus partial
In 1981, the Commission declined to designate as “focal”
a seizure that might involve an entire hemisphere, so the
term “partial” was preferred. The 1981 terminology was in a
way prescient of the modern emphasis on networks, but
“partial” conveys a sense of part of a seizure, rather than a
location or anatomic system. The term “focal” is more
understandable in terms of seizure-onset location.
Focal versus generalized
In 20101 the ILAE defined focal as “originating within
networks limited to one hemisphere. They may be discretely
localized or more widely distributed. Focal seizures may
originate in subcortical structures.” Generalized from onset
seizures were defined as “originating at some point within,
and rapidly engaging, bilaterally distributed networks.”
Classifying a seizure as having apparently generalized onset
does not rule out a focal onset obscured by limitations of our
current clinical methods, but this is more an issue of correct
diagnosis than of classification. Furthermore, focal seizures
may rapidly engage bilateral networks, whereas classifica-
tion is based on unilateral onset. For some seizure types, for
example, epileptic spasms, the distinction of a focal versus
generalized onset may require careful study of a video-EEG
recording or the type of onset may be unknown. A distinc-
tion between focal and generalized onset is a practical one,
and may change with advances in ability to characterize the
onset of seizures.
Focality of seizure onset can be inferred by pattern
matching to known focal-onset seizures, even when the
focality is not clear strictly in terms of observable behavior.
A seizure is focal, for example, when it starts with d�
ej�
a vu
and then progresses to loss of awareness and responsive-
ness, lip-smacking, and hand-rubbing for a minute. There is
nothing intrinsically “focal” in the description, but video-
EEG recordings of countless similar seizures have previ-
ously shown focal onsets. If the epilepsy type is known, the

 onset can be presumed even if it is unwitnessed; for exam-
ple, an absence seizure in a person with known juvenile
absence epilepsy.
Clinicians have long been aware that so-called general-
ized seizures, for example, absence seizures with EEG gen-
eralized spike-waves, do not manifest equally in all parts of
the brain. The Task Force emphasized the concept of bilat-
eral, rather than generalized, involvement of some seizures,
since seizures can be bilateral without involving every brain
network. The bilateral manifestations need not be symmet-
ric. The term “focal to bilateral tonic–clonic” was substi-
tuted for “secondarily generalized.” The term “generalized”
was maintained for seizures generalized from onset.
Unknown onset
Clinicians commonly hear about tonic–clonic seizures
for which the onset was unobserved. Perhaps, the patient
was asleep, alone, or observers were too distracted by the
manifestations of the seizure to notice the presence of focal
features. There should be an opportunity to provisionally
classify this seizure, even in the absence of knowledge about
its origin. The Task Force therefore allowed further descrip-
tion of seizures of unknown onset when key characteristics,
such as tonic–clonic activity or behavior arrest are observed
during the course of the seizure. The Task Force recom-
mends classifying a seizure as having focal or generalized
onset only when there is a high degree of confidence (e.g.,
≥80%, arbitrarily chosen to parallel the usual allowable beta
error) in the accuracy of the determination; otherwise, the
seizure should remain unclassified until more information is
available.
It may be impossible to classify a seizure at all, either
because of incomplete information or because of the unu-
sual nature of the seizure, in which case it is called an
unclassified seizure. Categorization as unclassified should
be used only for the exceptional situation in which the clini-
cian is confident that the event is a seizure but cannot further
classify the event.
Consciousness and awareness
The 1981 classification and the revision in 20101,10,32
suggested a fundamental distinction between seizures with
loss or impairment of consciousness and those with no
impairment of consciousness. Basing a classification on
consciousness (or one of its allied functions) reflects a prac-
tical choice that seizures with impaired consciousness
should often be approached differently from those with
unimpaired consciousness, for example, with respect to
allowing driving in adults or interfering with learning. The
ILAE chose to retain impairment of consciousness as a key
concept in the grouping of focal seizures. However, con-
sciousness is a complex phenomenon, with both subjective
and objective components.33 Multiple different types of
consciousness have been described for seizures.34 Surrogate
markers35–37
for
consciousness
usually
comprise
measurements of awareness, responsiveness, memory, and
a sense of self as distinct from others. The 1981 classifica-
tion specifically mentioned awareness and responsiveness,
but not memory for the event.
Retrospective determination of state of consciousness
can be difficult. An untrained classifier might assume that a
person must be on the ground, immobile, unaware, and
unresponsive (e.g., “passed out”) for a seizure to show
impaired consciousness. The Task Force adopted state of
awareness as a relatively simple surrogate marker for con-
sciousness. “Retained awareness” is considered to be an
abbreviation for “seizures with no impairment of conscious-
ness during the event.” We employ an operational definition
of awareness as knowledge of self and environment. In this
context, awareness refers to perception or knowledge of
events occurring during a seizure, not to knowledge of
whether a seizure occurred. In several languages, “unaware”
translates as “unconscious,” in which case changing the sei-
zure designation from “complex partial” to “impaired
awareness” will emphasize the importance of consciousness
by putting its surrogate directly in the seizure title. In Eng-
lish, “focal aware seizure” is shorter than is “focal seizure
without impairment of consciousness” and possibly better
understood by patients. As a practical issue, retained aware-
ness usually includes the presumption that the person having
the seizure later can recall and validate having retained
awareness; otherwise, impaired awareness may be assumed.
Exceptional seizures present with isolated transient epilep-
tic amnesia in clear awareness,38 but classification of an
amnestic seizure as a focal aware seizure would require
clear documentation by meticulous observers. Awareness
may be left unspecified when the extent of awareness cannot
be ascertained.
Responsiveness may or may not be compromised during
a focal seizure.39 Responsiveness does not equate to aware-
ness or consciousness, since some people are immobilized
and consequently unresponsive during a seizure, but still
able to observe and recall their environment. In addition,
responsiveness often is not tested during seizures. For these
reasons, responsiveness was not chosen as a primary feature
for seizure classification, although responsiveness can be
helpful in classifying the seizure when it can be tested, and
degree of responsiveness may be relevant to the impact of a
seizure. The term “dyscognitive” was not carried into the
current classification as a synonym for “complex partial”
because of lack of clarity and negative public and profes-
sional feedback.
Awareness is not a classifier for generalized-onset sei-
zures, because the large majority of generalized seizures
present with impaired awareness or full loss of conscious-
ness. However, it is recognized that awareness and respon-
siveness can be at least partially retained during some
generalized seizures, for example, with brief absence sei-
zures,40 including absence seizures with eyelid myoclonias
or myoclonic seizures.

Operational Classification of Seizure Types
 Etiology
A classification of seizure types can be applied to seizures
of different etiologies. A posttraumatic seizure or a reflex
seizure may be focal with or without impairment of aware-
ness. Knowledge of the etiology, for instance, presence of a
focal cortical dysplasia, can aid in classification of the sei-
zure type. Any seizure can become prolonged, leading to
status epilepticus of that seizure type.
Supportive information
As part of the diagnostic process, a clinician will com-
monly use supportive evidence to help classify a seizure,
even though that evidence is not part of the classification.
Such evidence may include videos brought in by family,
EEG patterns, lesions detected by neuroimaging, laboratory
results such as detection of antineuronal antibodies, gene
mutations, or an epilepsy syndrome diagnosis known to be
associated with either focal or generalized seizures or both,
such as Dravet syndrome. The seizures usually can be classi-
fied on the basis of symptoms and behavior, provided that
good subjective and objective descriptions are available. Use
of any available supportive information to classify the sei-
zure is encouraged. Availability of supportive information
may not exist in the resource-poor parts of the world, which
may lead to a less specific, but still correct classification.
ICD-9, ICD-10, ICD-11, and ICD-12
The World Health Organization International Classifica-
tion of Diseases (ICD) is used for inpatient and outpatient
diagnoses, billing, research, and many other purposes.41,42
Concordance between ICD epilepsy diagnoses and ILAE
seizure types is desirable for clarity and consistency. This is
possible only to a limited extent with existing ICD terms,
since ICD-9, ICD-10, and ICD-11 are already formulated.
The ILAE proposals will always lead ICD standards. ICD-9
and ICD-10 make use of old seizure terminology, including
terms such as petit mal and grand mal. ICD-11 does not
name seizure types at all, but focuses on epilepsy etiologies
and syndromes, as do ILAE epilepsy classifications.1 For
this reason, there is no conflict between our proposed sei-
zure type classification and ICD-11. Efforts can be made to
incorporate new classifications of seizure types and syn-
dromes into the development of ICD-12.
Discussion
Discontinued terms
Simple/complex partial
After approximately 35 years of use, the terms “simple
partial seizure” and “complex partial seizure” may be
missed by some clinicians. There are several reasons for
changing. First, a decision was previously made1 to globally
change partial to focal. Second, “complex partial” has no
intrinsic meaning to the public. The phrase “focal impaired
awareness” can convey meaning to a lay person with no
knowledge of seizure classification. Third, the words “com-
plex” and “simple” can be misleading in some contexts.
Complex seems to imply that this seizure type is more com-
plicated or difficult to understand than other seizure types.
Calling a seizure “simple” may trivialize its impact to a
patient who does not find the manifestations and conse-
quences of the seizures to be at all simple.

The term “convulsion” is a popular, ambiguous, and
unofficial term used to mean substantial motor activity dur-
ing a seizure. Such activity might be tonic, clonic, myoclo-
nic, or tonic–clonic. In some languages, convulsions and
seizures are considered synonyms and the motor component
is not clear. The word “convulsion” is not part of the 2017
seizure classification, but will undoubtedly persist in popu-
lar usage.
Added terms
Aware/impaired awareness
As discussed earlier, these terms designate knowledge of
self and environment during a seizure.
Hyperkinetic
Hyperkinetic seizures have been added to the focal sei-
zure category. Hyperkinetic activity comprises agitated
thrashing or leg pedaling movements. Hypermotor is an ear-
lier term introduced as part of a different proposed classifi-
cation by L€
uders and colleagues in 1993.43 The term
hypermotor, which contains both Greek and Roman roots,
was supplanted in the 2001 ILAE glossary44 and 2006
report2 by “hyperkinetic,” and to be both etymologically
and historically consistent, “hyperkinetic” was chosen for
the 2017 classification.
Cognitive
This term replaces “psychic” and refers to specific cogni-
tive impairments during the seizure, for example, aphasia,
apraxia, or neglect. The word “impairment” is implied
because seizures never enhance cognition. A cognitive sei-
zure can also comprise positive cognitive phenomena, such
as d�
ej�
a vu, jamais vu, illusions, or hallucinations.
Emotional
A focal nonmotor seizure can have emotional manifesta-
tions, such as fear or joy. The term also encompasses affec-
tive manifestations with the appearance of emotions
occurring without subjective emotionality, such as may
occur with some gelastic or dacrystic seizures.
New focal seizure types
Some seizure types that were described previously as
only generalized seizures now appear under seizures of

R. S. Fisher et al.
 focal, generalized and unknown onset. These include
epileptic spasms, tonic, clonic, atonic, and myoclonic sei-
zures. The list of motor behaviors constituting seizure types
comprises the most common focal motor seizures, but other
less common types, for example, focal tonic–clonic, may be
encountered. Focal automatisms, autonomic, behavior
arrest, cognitive, emotional, and hyperkinetic are new sei-
zure types. Focal to bilateral tonic–clonic seizure is a new
type as the renamed secondarily generalized seizure.
New generalized seizure types
Relative to the 1981 classification, new generalized sei-
zure
types
include
absence
with
eyelid
myoclonia,
myoclonic–atonic, and myoclonic–tonic–clonic (although
clonic onset of tonic–clonic seizures was mentioned in the
1981 publication). Seizures with eyelid myoclonia could
logically have been placed under the motor category, but
since eyelid myoclonia are most significant as features of
absence seizures, seizures with eyelid myoclonia were
placed in the nonmotor/absence category. Seizures with
eyelid myoclonia may even rarely display focal features.45
Similarly, myoclonic absence seizures potentially have
features of both absence and motor seizures, and could
have been placed in either group. Epileptic spasms are sei-
zures represented in focal, generalized, and unknown onset
categories, and the distinction may require video-EEG
recording. The term “epileptic” is implied for every seizure
type, but explicitly stated for epileptic spasms, because of
the ambiguity of the single word “spasms” in neurologic
use.
What is different from the 1981 classification?
Table 1 summarizes the changes in the ILAE 2017 sei-
zure type classification from the 1981 classification. Note
that several of these changes were already incorporated
into the 2010 revision of terminology and subsequent
revisions.1,32
Compared to the 1981 classification, certain seizure types
now appear in multiple categories. Epileptic spasms can be
of focal, generalized, or unknown onset. Represented both
in focal and generalized columns are atonic, clonic, myoclo-
nic, and tonic seizures, although the pathophysiology of
these seizure types may differ for the focal onset versus gen-
eralized-onset seizure type of that name.
A companion paper provides guidance on how to apply
the 2017 classification. Employment of the 2017 classifica-
tion in the field for a few years likely will motivate minor
revisions and clarifications.
