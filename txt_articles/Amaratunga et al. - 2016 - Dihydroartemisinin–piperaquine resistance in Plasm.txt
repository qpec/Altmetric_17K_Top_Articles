Abstract
Background—Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum threatens to reduce the efficacy 
of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), thus compromising global efforts to eliminate 
malaria. Recent treatment failures with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, the current first-line ACT 
in Cambodia, suggest that piperaquine resistance may be emerging in this country. We explored 
the relation between artemisinin resistance and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures, and 
sought to confirm the presence of piperaquine-resistant P falciparum infections in Cambodia.
Methods—In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled patients aged 2–65 years with 
uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in three Cambodian provinces: Pursat, Preah Vihear, and 
Ratanakiri. Participants were given standard 3-day courses of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. 
Peripheral blood parasite densities were measured until parasites cleared and then weekly to 63

 days. The primary outcome was recrudescent P falciparum parasitaemia within 63 days. We 
measured piperaquine plasma concentrations at baseline, 7 days, and day of recrudescence. We 
assessed phenotypic and genotypic markers of drug resistance in parasite isolates. The study is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01736319.
Findings—Between Sept 4, 2012, and Dec 31, 2013, we enrolled 241 participants. In Pursat, 
where artemisinin resistance is entrenched, 37 (46%) of 81 patients had parasite recrudescence. In 
Preah Vihear, where artemisinin resistance is emerging, ten (16%) of 63 patients had 
recrudescence and in Ratanakiri, where artemisinin resistance is rare, one (2%) of 60 patients did. 
Patients with recrudescent P falciparum infections were more likely to have detectable 
piperaquine plasma concentrations at baseline compared with non-recrudescent patients, but did 
not differ significantly in age, initial parasite density, or piperaquine plasma concentrations at 7 
days. Recrudescent parasites had a higher prevalence of kelch13 mutations, higher piperaquine 
50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, and lower mefloquine IC50 values; none had multiple 
pfmdr1 copies, a genetic marker of mefloquine resistance.
Interpretation—Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures are caused by both artemisinin and 
piperaquine resistance, and commonly occur in places where dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine has 
been used in the private sector. In Cambodia, artesunate plus mefloquine may be a viable option to 
treat dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures, and a more effective first-line ACT in areas where 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures are common. The use of single low-dose primaquine to 
eliminate circulating gametocytes is needed in areas where artemisinin and ACT resistance is 
prevalent.

Introduction
Artemisinin combination therapy—the use of a potent, short-acting artemisinin and a less-
potent, long-acting partner drug—is recommended worldwide for the treatment of 
Plasmodium falciparum malaria.1 Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, one of the few 
artemisinin combination therapies still effective against multidrug-resistant P falciparum in 
southeast Asia, was adopted as the first-line antimalarial treatment in Cambodia in 2008. 
Several earlier studies2–4 documented the excellent safety and tolerability of 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in Cambodia, as well as efficacy of 96–98% after 28 days 
or 63 days in the Cambodian provinces of Oddar Meancheay, Siem Reap, Pursat, and 
Kratie.3–6 However, the rapid spread of artemisinin resistance in Cambodia7–11 and 
throughout mainland southeast Asia10–12 threatens the efficacy of dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine and all other artemisinin combination therapies.13 This danger arises because as 
more parasites become resistant to artemisinin, more parasites need to be eliminated by the 
lone partner drug; therefore, they are more likely to spontaneously develop genetic 
resistance to piperaquine and other partner drugs.
Preliminary evidence for this development has been provided by three studies that show 
declining efficacy of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine shortly after its widespread 
deployment in western Cambodia. In a 2008–10 study,14 the efficacy of dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine after 42 days was 75% in Pailin and 89% in Pursat, but 100% in Preah Vihear

 and Ratanakiri in northern and eastern Cambodia. Because dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
failures were found not to be associated with piperaquine 50% inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) in this study, and piperaquine plasma concentrations at 7 days were not measured, 
piperaquine resistance in Pailin and Pursat could not be confirmed. The emergence of 
piperaquine resistance is also difficult to reconcile with concomitant decreases in 
piperaquine IC50 values in Pailin and Pursat.14 In a 2013 study,15,16 the efficacy of 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine after 42 days in Oddar Meancheay was 46%. Although 
patients with recrudescence or cure had similar exposures to piperaquine in this study, the 
piperaquine IC50 values for recrudescent parasites were not higher than those for non-
recrudescent parasites. Given this result, piperaquine resistance in this province also could 
not be confirmed. In a 2011–13 study,17 the proportion of recrudescent infections by 42 days 
after dihydro artemisinin–piperaquine treatment was higher in western Cambodia (15%) 
than in eastern Cambodia (3%). Patients with recrudescence or cure in this study had similar 
exposures to piperaquine and carried parasites with similar piperaquine IC50 values. In view 
of these findings and the lack of a genetic marker, piperaquine resistance in western 
Cambodia has not been confirmed, although increasing piperaquine IC50 values in northern 
Cambodia suggest that it may be emerging.18
The lack of clear evidence of piperaquine resistance in Cambodia hinders efforts to define 
its role in dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures, identify and validate genetic markers for 
use in large surveillance programmes, and study its molecular mechanism. We did a cohort 
study to identify piperaquine-resistant P falciparum infections in Cambodia. We postulated 
that such infections would be associated with artemisinin resistance,19 dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine failures, adequate piperaquine exposure, and decreased susceptibility of P 
falciparum isolates to piperaquine in vitro. We also postulated that dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine would fail more often in areas where artemisinin resistance is prevalent than 
where it is emerging. We therefore compared the efficacy of dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in Pursat, Preah 
Vihear, and Ratanakiri, where the prevalences of kelch13 mutations—a genetic marker for 
artemisinin resistance in Cambodia and elsewhere in southeast Asia9,10—were 76%, 21%, 
and 4%, respectively, in 2011–12.10 We also compared the prevalence of kelch13 mutations, 
plasma piperaquine concentrations after 7 days, and in-vitro piperaquine IC50 values 
between non-recrudescent and recrudescent infections to investigate the presence of 
piperaquine-resistant parasites.
Methods
Study design and participants
For this prospective cohort study, we recruited patients from provincial referral hospitals and 
district health centres in Pursat, Preah Vihear, and Ratanakiri provinces, Cambodia. Patients 
were eligible if they were aged 2–65 years and had acute, uncomplicated P falciparum 
malaria (excluding mixed infections with non-falciparum species), parasite density no more 
than 200 000 parasites per μL, and fever (a tympanic temperature ≥37.5°C) or fever in the 
previous 24 h. The main exclusion criteria were treatment of present symptoms with an 
antimalarial in the previous week, pregnancy or breastfeeding, and haematocrit <25%.

 The protocol was approved by the Cambodian National Ethics Committee for Health 
Research and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases institutional review 
board. Patients or parents of children younger than 18 years provided written informed 
consent.
Procedures
Patients were admitted to the hospital for supervised treatment and monitoring for resolution 
of parasitaemia. Just before administering the first dose of treatment at 0 h, the initial 
parasite density was measured in thick blood films. All patients were then treated at 0 h, 24 
h, and 48 h with Duo-Cotecxin tablets (Holley Pharmaceutical, Beijing, China), each 
containing dihydroartemisinin 40 mg and piperaquine 320 mg, according to bodyweight 
(<10 kg, half a tablet; 10–19 kg, one tablet; 20–29 kg, one and a half tablets; 30–39 kg, two 
tablets; ≥40 kg, three tablets) per the manufacturer's recommendation.
For patients with a parasite density of 10 000 para sites per μL or more at screening, we 
measured parasite densities at 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h, and every 6 h thereafter until three 
consecutive blood films showed no parasitaemia (ie, no ring-stage parasites were observed 
after 500 leucocytes were examined by microscopy). For patients with an initial parasite 
density of less than 10 000 parasites per μL, we measured parasite densities every 24 h until 
one blood film showed no parasitaemia.
At 7 days and then weekly to 63 days, we measured body temperature, reviewed malaria 
symptoms, and took a finger-prick blood sample to screen for recurrent parasitaemia using a 
rapid diagnostic test (First Response; Premier Medical Corporation, Nani Daman, India) and 
microscopy. Parasite densities were measured in samples with detectable parasitaemia. A 
200-μL blood sample was also collected for measuring piperaquine plasma concentrations.
Patients who developed asymptomatic P falciparum parasitaemia or uncomplicated P 
falciparum malaria (with or without co-incident Plasmodium vivax parasitaemia) within 63 
days were admitted to the hospital for supervised oral treatment at 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h with 
artesunate (4 mg/kg; Guilin Pharmaceutical, Shanghai, China) plus Malarone tablets 
(GlaxoSmithKlein; Hanover, PA, USA), each containing atovaquone 250 mg and proguanil 
100 mg (in adult tablets) or atovaquone 62.5 mg and proguanil 25 mg (in child tablets), 
according to bodyweight (5–8 kg, two child tablets; 9–10 kg, three child tablets; 11–20 kg, 
one adult tablet; 21–30 kg, two adult tablets; 31–40 kg, three adult tablets; >40 kg, four 
adult tablets) per the manufacturer's recommendation. Patients were then monitored daily for 
resolution of fever and clearance of parasitaemia. Patients who developed P vivax infection 
(with or without malaria symptoms) within 63 days were treated with Duo-Cotecxin tablets 
as described above.
Plasma samples were transported on dry ice to the Department of Clinical Pharmacology, 
Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand. The laboratory is 
accredited according to ISO15189 and ISO15190, and participates in the WorldWide 
Antimalarial Resistance Network quality control and assurance proficiency testing 
programme.20 Piperaquine concentrations were measured by a validated method.21 Quality 
control samples (4.5 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 400 ng/mL) showed intra-day and inter-day

 variabilities below 10% during drug measurements of study samples. The lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) was 1.5 ng/mL; the lower limit of detection (LLOD) was 0.375 
ng/mL. Values below these limits were imputed as LLOQ/2 or LLOD/2, respectively, before 
statistical analysis.
We did genotyping for pfmdr1 and X5r copy numbers22 and kelch13 propeller and pfcrt 
mutations.23 In 168 samples for which kelch13 genotypes were unavailable, the propeller 
domain of kelch13 was amplified by nested PCR with previously described9 primers (K13-1 
forward 5′-cggagtgaccaaatctggga-3′ and K13-4 reverse 5′-gggaatctggtggtaacagc-3′ for the 
primary reaction, and K13-N1 forward 5′-gccaagctgccattcatttg-3′ and K13-N1 reverse 5′-
gccttgttgaaagaagcaga-3′ for the secondary reaction), with some modifications to PCR 
conditions. 1 μL of DNA was amplified with 0.2 μmol/L of each primer, 0.2 mmol/L 
deoxynucleoside triphosphates (Bioline USA; Taunton, MA, USA), 1.6 mmol/L MgCl2, and 
0.25 U PerfectTaqTM DNA polymerase (5 PRIME; Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to 
the following cycling programme: 4 min at 94°C, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 1 min at 58°C, 1 
min at 72°C, and 4 min at 72°C. For the nested PCR, 1.5 μL of primary PCR products were 
amplified under the same conditions, except with 1.2 mmol/L MgCl2 and 0.375 U 
PerfectTaq, and annealing for 1 min at 60°C. PCR products were purified from 2% agarose 
gels and sequenced by Macrogen (Rockville, MD, USA). Sequences were analysed with 
DNASTAR Lasergene. The kelch13 sequence of the 3D7 parasite line was used as the 
reference (accession number XM_001350122.1) to locate single nucleotide polymorphisms 
in clinical isolates. For recurrent infections, PCR genotyping was done, with msp1, msp2, 
and glurp as genetic markers to distinguish recrudescence from a newly acquired 
infection.24 In brief, DNA samples extracted from 200 μL of whole blood were assessed for 
polymorphisms in these genes by nested PCR.25 Genomic DNA samples from the HB3 and 
3D7 parasite lines were used as controls. According to WHO recommendations,26 recurrent 
episodes were classified as recrudescences if all msp1, msp2, and glurp alleles present at the 
time of recurrence were also present before treatment. In all other cases, they were 
considered new infections.
We did in-vitro testing of drug susceptibility for parasites freshly obtained from participants 
by means of a standard 72-h method using SYBR Green I stain.22 We calculated IC50 values 
with use of IVART software27 to fit the concentration–inhibition data. Antimalarial drug 
standards were provided by the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network, except for 
piperaquine (Sigma; Steinheim, Germany).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was P falciparum recrudescence within 63 days of starting 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment. Secondary outcomes were piperaquine plasma 
concentrations at 7 days and day of recrudescence; parasite clearance half-life;28–30 the 
proportion of patients with a parasite clearance half-life longer than 5 h;10 and the 
proportion of patients with parasitaemia detected by microscopy at 72 h.31

 Statistical analysis
To analyse categorical data, we used Fisher's exact test (R version 3.1.2). For quantitative 
data, we used a Kruskal-Wallis test (for comparing three sites) or a Mann-Whitney test (for 
comparing two sites; GraphPad Prism 6). If the overall test between all three sites was 
significant, it was followed by three tests comparing the pairs of sites. When these four tests 
are applied this way with the same significance level, no adjustment for multiple com 
parisons is necessary to bound the familywise type I error rate;32 hence, there was no need 
to adjust the p values. Survival analysis approximates time to recurrence or censoring at the 
time of blood sampling and uses Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test 
(GraphPad Prism 6). For the PCR-corrected survival analysis, reinfections and those we 
were unable to classify as a recrudescence or reinfection were censored. To compare 
piperaquine IC50 values with corresponding plasma concentrations, we used the paired t test 
CIs on the log-transformed values. To compare piperaquine IC50 values for paired initial and 
recrudescent isolates, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (GraphPad Prism 6). Parasite 
clearance half-life is a measure of the parasite clearance rate derived from the linear segment 
of the log parasitaemia–time curve (parasite clearance half-life=loge2 divided by the parasite 
clearance rate). We deemed p values of less than 0.05 as significant.

Results
Between Sept 4, 2012, and Dec 31, 2013, we screened 6209 indivi duals presenting with 
symptoms consistent with malaria for eligibility (table 1). We enrolled 241 (table 2). Most 
patients were male and median age was 24 years. A greater proportion of patients in Pursat 
and Preah Vihear were male, were older, and had greater bodyweight than did those in 
Ratanakiri (table 2). Median haematocrit was 39% and was significantly higher in patients in 
Pursat than in Ratanakiri. Median parasite density was 12 249 cells per μL, and did not 
differ between the three sites. 11% of patients had gametocytaemia at enrolment, with 
significantly more in Pursat than in Ratanakiri (table 2). More patients in Pursat had 
detectable and higher piperaquine concentrations than did those in Ratanakiri. The relative 
piperaquine concentrations in the three sites paralleled the numbers of patients excluded 
from our study because of previous use of artemisinin combination therapies in the private 
sector (table 1).
29 patients were censored in the survival analysis because they were lost to follow-up 
(n=18), withdrew from the study (n=2), or developed P vivax parasitaemia between 42 days 
and 63 days that required retreatment with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (n=9; table 3). 
Of these 29 patients, 23 were from Pursat, reflecting the higher incidence of P vivax malaria 
and emigration from this province during the study.

 Among the 212 patients who were followed up to 63 days, the proportion of those with 
recurrent P falciparum infection differed significantly by site, with the most in Pursat and 
the least in Ratanakiri (table 3). Recurrent infections were detected between 14 days and 63 
days (median 28 days). Neither the day nor parasite density of recurrent infections differed 
significantly between sites. More than three quarters of patients with recurrent P falciparum 
infection were febrile (table 3), and all cleared their parasitaemia within 72 h of receiving 
Malarone. PCR correction identified seven recurrent parasitaemias as reinfections and one 
as indeterminate. The efficacy of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine with PCR correction also 
differed significantly by site, being greatest in Ratanakiri (figure, table 3).
Piperaquine concentrations at 7 days were significantly higher in patients in Pursat and 
Preah Vihear than in Ratanakiri (table 3). These differences were still significant after 
correcting for each individual's dose of piperaquine. At the time of recrudescence, mean 
piperaquine concentration was 22.6 ng/mL (SD 35.5). Piperaquine concentrations correlated 
significantly with the day of recrudescence (Spearman's r=–0.40, p=0.005; appendix p 1).
The parasite clearance half-life was significantly longer in Pursat than in Preah Vihear or 
Ratanakiri (table 4). The time to 90% (but not 50%) parasite clearance was also significantly 
longer in Pursat than in Preah Vihear and Ratanakiri (table 4). The proportions of patients 
with parasite clearance half-life longer than 5 h or detectable parasitaemia at 72 h were 
significantly greater in Pursat than in Preah Vihear, and greater in Preah Vihear than in 
Ratanakiri. The presence of a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in kelch13 
after position 440 was higher in Pursat than in Preah Vihear, and higher in Preah Vihear than 
in Ratanakiri (table 3).
To investigate patient and parasite factors associated with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
failure, we compared the characteristics of recrudescent and non-recrudescent infections 
(table 5). A larger proportion of patients with recrudescence were male, and had detectable 
and higher piperaquine plasma concentrations at the time of enrolment than those with no 
recrudescence, but their age, initial parasite density, total piper aquine dose, and piperaquine 
plasma concentration at 7 days did not differ significantly (table 5, appendix p 2).
Compared with non-recrudescent parasites, recrudescent parasites had higher chloroquine, 
piperaquine, and atovaquone IC50 values; similar artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, quinine, 
and pyronaridine IC50 values; and lower mefloquine IC50 values (table 5, appendix p 3). 
These data are consistent with observations7,8 that artemisinin resistance is not associated 
with increased artesunate or dihydroartemisinin IC50 values. Recrudescent parasites had 
piperaquine IC50 values (geometric mean 64.6 ng/mL) that were 3.85-times (95% CI 2.70–
5.47) higher than the corresponding patients' piperaquine plasma concentrations (16.8 
ng/mL, n=30) at the time of recrudescence, suggesting that they were resistant to 
piperaquine. Piperaquine IC50 values did not differ between paired initial and recrudescent 
isolates (p=0.13, n=23), suggesting that piperaquine resistance did not arise within patients 
during the study.
Significantly more recrudescent parasites carried kelch13 mutations than did non-
recrudescent parasites (table 5). None of 48 recrudescent parasites had multiple pfmdr1

 copies, compared with 11% of non-recrudescent parasites (table 5). Although multiple 
chromosome 5 region (X5r) copies and the pfcrt cys101phe mutation have been associated 
with in-vitro piperaquine resistance,33 multiple X5r copies were not associated with 
recrudescence or piperaquine IC50 values in our study, and pfcrt cys101phe was not present 
in any sample.
Discussion
The intensive spread of artemisinin resistance in Cambodia7–10 is rapidly threatening to 
reduce the efficacy of all artemisinin combination therapies used in this country and in 
bordering areas of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. This threat arises because more parasites 
survive exposure to the fast-acting artemisinin component, increasing the chance that some 
of them will spontaneously develop genetic resistance to long-acting partner drugs. In this 
study, dihydro artemisinin–piperaquine cured 63% of patients in Pursat province, where 
artemisinin resistance is entrenched, 85% of patients in Preah Vihear province, where 
artemisinin resistance is emerging, and 98% of patients in Ratanakari province, where 
artemisinin resistance is rare. The proportion of patients cured paralleled the prevalence of 
kelch13 mutations (77% vs 34% vs 11%). Treatment failures were not associated with 
patient age, initial parasite density, or piperaquine plasma concentration at 7 days, 
suggesting that they did not result from lower levels of age-dependent, parasite-clearing 
immunity,34,35 higher parasite load, or lower plasma exposure to piperaquine. Although 
patients in Ratanakiri had significantly lower piperaquine concentrations at 7 days than 
those in other provinces (probably due to the greater proportion of children, who clear 
piperaquine more rapidly than do adults),3,36 recrudescences in Ratanakiri were rare.
Recrudescent parasites were almost three-times more likely to have kelch13 mutations than 
were non-recrudescent parasites. Recrudescent parasites also had higher piperaquine IC50 
values than non-recrudescent parasites, and had piperaquine IC50 values that were nearly 
four-times higher than piperaquine plasma concentrations at the time of recrudescence, 
strongly indicating that piperaquine resistance has emerged and spread in Cambodia. 
Surprisingly, patients with recrudescence were much more likely to have detectable and 
higher piperaquine plasma concentrations at the time of enrolment than were patients 
without recrudescence, suggesting that they presented to our study with a recrudescent 
parasitaemia following an earlier dihydro artemisinin–piperaquine failure in the private 
sector. This result is reminiscent of a finding of detectable piperaquine plasma 
concentrations in 15% of patients in Pursat in 2008,37 and suggests that intensified efforts 
are needed to discourage what appears to be a highly ineffective approach of self-treatment 
in the private sector, and instead to encourage hospital admission for patients in areas where 
artemisinin combination therapy-resistant falciparum malaria is prevalent.
Recrudescent parasites had significantly lower mefloquine IC50 values and all had only one 
copy of pfmdr1. This latter finding is consistent with that of a previous study14 in which 17 
of 18 dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures in Pailin and Pursat were also associated with 
one pfmdr1 copy. Together, all available data suggest that dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine 
failures are due to both artemisinin and piperaquine resistance. They also suggest that 
artesunate plus mefloquine should be tested as a front-line artemisinin combination therapy

 in areas of Cambodia where dihydro artemisinin–piperaquine failures have been 
documented, and also as a salvage treatment for patients with dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine failures elsewhere in the country. Whether deamplification of pfmdr1 and 
increased sensitivity to mefloquine is a result of the removal of mefloquine selection 
pressure, the addition of piperaquine selection pressure, or both, awaits further investigation. 
Given that piperaquine-resistant parasites are highly susceptible to atovaquone and 
pyronaridine in vitro, artesunate plus atovaquone–proguanil or artesunate–pyronaridine38 
might be effective alternatives for patients who cannot take mefloquine.
Our study is the third report of poor clinical efficacy of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in 
Cambodia, and extends this finding to Preah Vihear. In Pursat, where the prevalence of 
mutant kelch13 alleles has increased from 40% in 2003–04,9 to 77% in 2012–13, the 
efficacy of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine has decreased from 98% in 2005,6 to 63% in 
2012–13. These findings, and the observation that piperaquine IC50 values have increased 
since dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was widely used in 2010,15,22 suggest that parasites 
resistant to artemisinin and piperaquine are spreading rapidly in Cambodia, that the parasites 
most sensitive to piperaquine are being eliminated, or both. Results from this study and two 
previous studies10,16 have documented an increased gametocyte prevalence in patients with 
artemisinin-resistant parasites, suggesting that they have increased transmission potential. 
Whether this finding is related to increased transmissibility of slow-clearing parasites 
following dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment in Kenya39 requires further 
investigation. Studies are also needed to test whether single low-dose primaquine40 prevents 
the transmission of dihydro artemisinin–piperaquine-resistant parasites to native and non-
native mosquito vectors.41
Because few other artemisinin combination therapies (eg, artemether-lumefantrine6,42 and 
artesunate-pyronaridine38) are available, and because artemisinin resistance will probably 
accelerate resistance to any partner drug, investigations of alternative treatment approaches 
are urgently needed. These include further clinical testing of new compounds;43 frequent 
cycling between combination therapies, which has tremendous logistic challenges; 
deployment of multiple first-line artemisinin combination therapies simultaneously at the 
population level; treating patients sequentially with two artemisinin combination therapies, 
such as dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine followed by artesunate plus mefloquine;44 using 
extended combination therapies, such as three doses of artesunate followed by a full course 
of an artemisinin combination therapy;10 and introducing three-drug regimens such as 
dihydro artemisinin–piperaquine plus mefloquine (as is being tested in a clinical trial; 
ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02453308). Improvements in the treatment of P falciparum 
malaria with real-time drug resistance data, identification and treatment of asymptomatic 
parasite carriers through community treatment campaigns, and prevention of gametocyte 
transmission to mosquitoes with single low-dose primaquine, are now needed more than 
ever if malaria elimination is to succeed in southeast Asia.

 Panel: Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed using the terms “dihydroartemisinin”, “piperaquine”, “efficacy”, 
and “Cambodia” without any date or language restrictions on June 5, 2015. We identified 
13 articles, six of which were original clinical trials of the efficacy of 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria in Cambodia. Three studies from 2001–05 showed that efficacy was 96–98% 
before dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was widely used. Three later studies reported 
reduced efficacy (46–89%) in 2008–13, after dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine became 
widely used. Treatment failure has been linked to parasite kelch13 mutations, which are 
associated with artemisinin resistance. All three of the later studies found no association 
between treatment failures and high piperaquine in-vitro IC50 values (a measure of 
parasite susceptibility to piperaquine). The role of in-vivo piperaquine resistance in 
treatment failures has not been adequately assessed.
Added value of this study
Our findings suggest that dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine treatment is failing in Pursat 
and Preah Vihear, where artemisinin resistance is prevalent, but remains highly 
efficacious in Ratanakiri where artemisinin resistance is uncommon. Treatment failures 
were not associated with older patient age, higher initial parasite density, or high 
piperaquine plasma concentration at 7 days. Instead, recrudescent parasites had more 
kelch13 mutations and high piperaquine IC50 values, indicating that dihydroartemisinin–
piperaquine failures are due to both artemisinin and piperaquine resistance. These 
recrudescent parasites also have reduced mefloquine IC50 values and lack multiple copies 
of pfmdr1, a genetic marker for mefloquine resistance.
Implications of all the available evidence
Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is failing quickly in four western Cambodian provinces 
(Pailin, Pursat, Oddar Meanchey, and Preah Vihear), and is associated with parasite 
resistance to both artemisinin derivatives and piperaquine. Evidence of piperaquine 
resistance in P falciparum should prompt efforts to map this phenotype in Cambodia and 
other southeast Asian countries, to elucidate its molecular mechanism, and to discover 
new drugs that circumvent piperaquine resistance. Artesunate plus mefloquine should be 
tested as a first-line therapy where dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures have been 
documented, and also as a salvage treatment for dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine failures 
in Cambodia. Clinical trials should be done of a triple-drug regimen of 
dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus mefloquine.

*Not measured for 21 patients because of missed visit (16 in Pursat, one in Preah Vihear, three in Ratanakiri) or low sample quantity (one in Ratanakiri).
†Calculated with the Kruskal-Wallis test; Mann-Whitney tests indicate that absolute piperaquine plasma concentrations at day 7 were significantly lower in Ratanakiri than in Pursat (p=0.0020) and than in 
Preah Vihear (p=0.012), with no significant difference between Pursat and Preah Vihear (p=0.97); and that normalised piperaquine plasma concentrations at day 7 were also significantly lower in Ratanakiri 
than in Pursat (p=0.0004) and than in Preah Vihear (p=0.0038), with no significant difference between Pursat and Preah Vihear (p=0.91).
‡The denominator excludes patients who were lost to follow-up (n=18), withdrew themselves from the study (n=2), or developed Plasmodium vivax parasitaemia between 42 days and 63 days that required 
retreatment with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (n=9).
§Calculated with Fisher's exact test; recurrence was higher in Pursat than in Preah Vihear (p=0.0001) and Ratanakiri (p<0.0001), and higher in Preah Vihear than in Ratanakiri (p=0.016); these effects 
remained significant after dose-normalisation.
¶Calculated with the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.

p values in the table are for difference between all three sites. Time to 50% parasite clearance was not determined for two patients in Pursat, one patient in Preah Vihear, and three patients in Ratanakiri. 
Time to 90% parasite clearance was not determined for one patient in Ratanakiri. SNP=single nucleotide polymorphism.
*Calculated with Fishers' exact test; the proportion of patients with parasite clearance half-life >5 h was higher in Pursat than in Preah Vihear (p=0.021), higher in Preah Vihear than in Ratanakiri 
(p=0.0006), and higher in Pursat than in Ratanakiri (p<0.0001); the proportion of patients still positive for parasitemia at 72 h was higher in Pursat than in Preah Vihear (p=0.0027), higher in Preah Vihear 
than in Ratanakiri (p=0.013), and higher in Pursat than in Ratanakiri (p<0.0001); the proportion of parasites with a kelch13 mutation was higher in Pursat than in Preah Vihear (p<0.0001), higher in Preah 
Vihear than in Ratanakiri (p=0.016), and higher in Pursat than in Ratanakiri (p<0.0001).
†Calculated with Kruskal-Wallis test; Mann-Whitney tests indicate that half-life and time to 90% parasite clearance were longer in Pursat than in Ratanakiri (p<0.0001 for both); half-life was longer in 
Pursat than in Preah Vihear (p=0.0077), with no significant difference between Preah Vihear and Ratanakiri (p=0.17); 90% parasite clearance was significantly longer in Pursat than in Preah Vihear 
(p=0.0096), with no significant difference between Preah Vihear and Ratanakiri (p=0.14).
