Classification schemes for carcinogenicity based solely on hazard-identification such as the IARC
monograph process and the UN system adopted in the EU have become outmoded. They are based on a
concept developed in the 1970s that chemicals could be divided into two classes: carcinogens and non-
carcinogens. Categorization in this way places into the same category chemicals and agents with widely
differing potencies and modes of action. This is how eating processed meat can fall into the same
category as sulfur mustard gas. Approaches based on hazard and risk characterization present an inte-
grated and balanced picture of hazard, dose response and exposure and allow informed risk manage-
ment decisions to be taken. Because a risk-based decision framework fully considers hazard in the
context of dose, potency, and exposure the unintended downsides of a hazard only approach are avoided,
e.g., health scares, unnecessary economic costs, loss of beneficial products, adoption of strategies with
greater health costs, and the diversion of public funds into unnecessary research. An initiative to agree
upon a standardized, internationally acceptable methodology for carcinogen assessment is needed now.
The approach should incorporate principles and concepts of existing international consensus-based
frameworks including the WHO IPCS mode of action framework.

1. Introduction
Cancer prevention is the primary objective of the evaluation of
chemicals for their human carcinogenicity potential. This objective,
however, is undermined by confusion resulting from conflicting
pronouncements coming from multiple international and national
agencies (Guardian, 2016). This has led to carcinogen definition and
regulation being called “the poor relation to other cancer preven-
tative measures” (Lancet, 2016). The problem arises from the
different concepts and approaches that are being used, some of

 which were developed half a century ago. Their appropriateness
was questionable at the time and they have now clearly become out
of step with advances in scientific understanding and modern
regulatory science.
Classifying chemicals on hazard-identification alone is one such
outmoded concept. The International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) classification process for carcinogenicity and the
United Nations Global Harmonized System for Classification and
Labelling (GHS) (adapted and adopted in the EU and elsewhere)
processes for carcinogenicity (and reproductive toxicity) are based
on this outmoded concept.
The original intention of these processes was to raise a warning
flag for chemicals of potential concern which would lead to fuller
evaluation to determine if risk management measures need to be
taken. However, the warning flags are never removed, and some-
times they even appear after more complete evaluation by regu-
latory authorities has determined that adequate risk management
is in place. Of even greater concern is that evaluation often stops at
classification and acceptability is based only on hazard with no
consideration of the potential risk under even extreme (though
remotely possible) human exposure.
This hazard-identification only process places chemicals with
widely differing potencies and very different modes of action into
the same category. Processed meat (consumption) and sulfur
mustard gas are placed into the same category (group 1) by IARC as
described in section 6. This leads to confusion; should we treat
processed meat as we do sulfur mustard gas e reduce exposure to
zero; or should we treat sulfur mustard gas as we do red meat e
consider it part of a healthy life style in moderation? This catego-
rization can thus lead to unnecessary public anxiety; resources may
be diverted that would be better used addressing more substantial
problems; safe and useful products come under unnecessary and
excessive scrutiny; and they may even be replaced by other less
characterized and potentially less safe products.
This present work describes the origins of classification schemes
based on hazard-identification, acknowledges that they were once
useful, explains why they no longer serve a useful role and illus-
trates how science-based approaches in a risk based decision
framework are more suited to protecting human health in the 21st
century.
2. Advances in public health and chemical risk management
The 20th century saw great advances in the state of public
health; managing the potential risks from chemicals has played its
part. Life expectancy increased by over 30 years in Europe and the
Americas between 1900 and 2000 (Roser, 2015). Certain chemicals
and technologies developed in the late 19th century and early 20th
century did come at a price, however. At the time, there was poor
understanding of the range of biological effects that chemicals
could cause until the pioneering observational studies that identi-
fied how chemicals could adversely affect human health were
published (Goldblatt, 1944). Many adverse effects observed in
humans were then verified in animal studies. By the middle of the
20th century there was a shift towards the use of animal studies to
predict what could happen in humans, which led, in the 60's and
70's, to the development of extensive and diverse toxicological
studies to identify and characterize chemical hazards, and predict
the human safe dose, before adverse effects could occur in humans.
Hazard-identification and characterization via animal studies
became the standard for predicting and then avoiding potential
adverse effects in humans. As a result of this approach to chemical
safety assessment, exposure to high-risk chemicals has been pro-
gressively reduced (Kauppinen et al., 2013). Whilst not perfect, this
approach has the advantage that chemicals potentially toxic to
humans are identified before there is any human exposure.
3. Classification and risk assessment
The results of laboratory animal toxicology studies are used for
identifying in animals adverse health effects assumed without
additional information to represent a potential hazard to humans
which may be further characterized in terms of severity and dose
response. This information is then most appropriately used for
assessing potential human health impact from the use or presence
in the environment of the chemical. There are two major ways in
which this is done: risk assessment and classification.
Risk assessment requires estimation of the human exposure in
terms of duration, frequency and magnitude to derive a plausible
maximum dose to which humans might be exposed. This dose is
then compared with the projected safe human dose level derived
from hazard characterization; if the projected exposure is lower
than the projected human safe dose then safety in use can be
assumed, and if not then it may be necessary to identify and
implement risk mitigation measures. Risk assessment also requires
evaluation of the relevance of the findings at high doses in animal
studies to lower exposures in humans. Mechanisms leading to
toxicity in animals might not be relevant to humans, or changes
occurring at high doses might not be relevant to low does. In other
words, scientific evaluations are necessary.
Classification uses a different approach while being based on
similar principles. It focuses on the hazard which has been identi-
fied, usually from animal studies and, then, grades the hazard into
various categories based on the severity and, in some instances,
dose response. Classification was originally intended to provide
information on the effects of a chemical following acute exposure
for labelling purposes for transport (UN, 2011). However, its use has
broadened substantially so that many regulatory schemes are based
solely on classification for a range of end points following either
acute or repeated exposure leading directly to risk management
action without consideration of the chemical potency, severity of
the effect or mode of action or the nature and extent of human
exposure.
4. Problems with classification
The advantages and disadvantages of both approaches have
been reviewed by Barlow et al., 2015, who concluded that both
approaches have their uses depending on the situation being
addressed. Classification is more appropriate for acute toxicity or in
situations where it is hypothesized that there is no threshold for an
adverse effect. It requires less data and can be valuable in providing
guidance when a decision has to be taken before a full evaluation
has been carried out. Risk assessment provides more information
and insight into the magnitude of risks, and can be used as a basis
for deriving “safe” levels of exposure. However, problems can arise
when both approaches are used in regulation by the same or
different agencies that address the same agent/substance. This
separation of decision-making can result in hazard-based re-
strictions on marketing and use or unnecessary remediation of
environmental levels, even when risk-based assessments show
there is reasonable certainty no harm will result. This in turn can
lead
to contradictory,
confusing and
ultimately unnecessary
actions.
These problems arise most often when the classification process
focuses simply on identifying the hazard but does not go on to
characterize the hazard in terms of severity, dose response and
mode of action. This is the situation with some schemes in the areas
of carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity, and it is a source of the
current controversy on how to prioritise and manage the risk posed
A.R. Boobis et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 82 (2016) 158e166
159
 by chemicals identified as endocrine disrupters. The omission of
characterization of both hazard and risk in these schemes stems
from the historical special treatment given to certain health effects
based on their public perception (Slovic, 1987) such as carcinogenic
and reproductive toxicity effects, and more recently endocrine
disruption, neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity.
5. Cancer as a major concern
Cancer had become such a concern that in 1971 US President
Nixon signed the National Cancer Act saying in his State of the
Union Address “The time has come when the same type of
concentrated effort that split the atom and took a man to the moon
should be turned toward conquering this dread disease”. Large
sums of money were devoted to reducing cancer deaths and pre-
vention was seen as part of the “war on cancer” as well as the
discovery and development of treatments. It was believed, at the
time, that a large proportion of cancers were caused by industrial
chemicals. Hueper (1955) from the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
had concluded that cancer from exposure to industrial chemicals
was of far greater concern than cancer from tobacco smoking. This
has since been shown to be incorrect as tobacco smoking is now
recognized as the second leading cause of death globally, with 6.3
million deaths annually attributed to smoking (GBD2010, 2012).
In the middle of the 20th century, the concept developed that
chemicals could be segregated into two classes: carcinogens and
non-carcinogens. It was postulated that a major reduction in cancer
incidence would result if we could identify the “carcinogens” and,
hence, replace them with “non-carcinogens”. This concept started
the drive towards using hazard-identification alone for carcinoge-
nicity which has continued for nearly half a century in a largely
unmodified way. It was also the basis for the use of the Maximum
Tolerated Dose in animal studies which was thought to optimize
the chances of identifying “carcinogens”. Whilst the concept was
considered sound in principle at the time, it was based on a
fundamental misconception. There is now a greater understanding
of the complex biology and etiology of cancer, specifically how
chemical exposure can lead to cancer, and the idea of a binary
separation into “carcinogens” and “non-carcinogens” has proved to
be overly simplistic. Indeed, a very wide range of chemical cans
cause cancer under the “right” experimental circumstances many
of which having no relevance to humans or achievable exposure
levels (see section 7).
6. Cancer classification
Carcinogen hazard-identification is primarily based on the
evaluation of human epidemiological data, if available, and the
results of long term bioassays in laboratory rodents. At first most of
the evaluations were based upon human epidemiology studies in
occupational settings. Processes were set up by several national and
international bodies to identify carcinogens that were largely based
on Sir Austin Bradford Hill's considerations for causality (Hill,1965).
The strength of the evidence for causality varied and, therefore, it
was graded to allow chemicals to be placed into different categories
regarding the confidence in a causal link for carcinogenicity in
humans.
The categories used today by IARC (2012) still reflect this:
� Group 1: The agent is carcinogenic to humans
� Group 2A: The agent is probably carcinogenic to humans
� Group 2B: The agent is possibly carcinogenic to humans.
� Group 3: The agent is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to
humans
� Group 4: The agent is probably not carcinogenic to humans.
Whether by accident or design, this was a classification system
and, therefore, it was not surprising that this system was co-opted
into some of the chemical classification schemes which were
emerging in the 1970s and 1980s. However, unlike the other clas-
sification systems developed for health protection, the carcinoge-
nicity scheme deliberately avoided the valuable context of hazard
or of dose response, severity, and mode of action or exposure. At the
time this scheme was put in place, such characterization was not
thought necessary as the aim was simply to identify “carcinogens”
and to eliminate them.
The EU in its Classification and Labelling Guidelines (ECHA,
2012) has implemented the UN GHS categorization system which
is very similar using strength of evidence involving only the
enumeration of tumors in human and animal studies and deter-
mination of their level of statistical significance. The Guidelines
state that “Sufficient human evidence demonstrates causality between
human exposure and the development of cancer, whereas sufficient
evidence in animals shows a causal relationship between the sub-
stance and an increased incidence of tumors. Limited evidence in
humans is demonstrated by a positive association between exposure
and cancer, but a causal relationship cannot be stated. Limited evi-
dence in animals is provided when data suggest a carcinogenic effect,
but are less than sufficient. The terms 'sufficient' and 'limited' have
been used here as they have been defined by the International Agency
for Research on Cancer (IARC).”
The UN GHS categories are.
� Category 1A: Known to have carcinogenic potential for humans,
the placing of a substance in this category is largely based on
human evidence
� Category 1B: Presumed to have carcinogenic potential for
humans: the placing of a substance in this category is largely
based on animal evidence
� Category 2: Suspected Human carcinogen
Thus a system set up half a century ago based on an overly
simplistic concept as an initial attempt to address the disease
burden of cancer has found its way into classification schemes for
chemicals and also into some downstream risk management pro-
cesses. The consequences may not have been intended but they
were predictable. The pressure to replace a chemical which had
been identified as a potential human carcinogen was immense,
even on the basis of animal studies, and the very act of categorizing
a chemical in this way leads to a stigma which would often result in
major changes in its use, including withdrawal, whereas risk-based
assessments show that there is reasonable certainty no harm will
result from its use.
7. Introduction of the cancer bioassay
All of this was occurring at the time as the potential of chemicals
to cause adverse effects was being recognized and animal models
were being developed. The long term bioassay for carcinogenicity
was accepted as an OECD guideline study in 1981 (OECD, 2009) and
the results of rodent bioassays were used as evidence, either
alongside or instead of epidemiology, in deciding whether a
chemical should be classified as a “carcinogen”. Since known hu-
man carcinogens, based on epidemiology studies, also caused
cancer in animal models, it was concluded that a chemical that
caused cancer in an animal model must also cause cancer in
humans. Their reverse incorrect logic has been proven wrong
numerous times. For example, about 60% of pharmaceuticals tested
in the rodent bioassay gave positive results, but have been deemed
safe for human use (Brambilla et al., 2012). Applying a hazard
classification would have kept these life-saving pharmaceuticals off
A.R. Boobis et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 82 (2016) 158e166
160
 the market, including statins and proton pump inhibitors, two of
the most widely used classes of drugs today.
The bioassay was intended for hazard-identification and was
therefore designed to maximize the ability to detect “carcinoge-
nicity”. Dosing was for as much of the life time of the animals as
possible. Historically, exposure started after weaning, some newer
study designs start exposure before birth. The highest dose was set
as a Minimally Toxic Dose that would not impact the animals'
normal lifespan from effects other than cancer. This evolved into
the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), which increased the doses
used in an attempt to increase sensitivity to detect the “carcino-
genicity” of low potency compounds. Under these assay conditions
50% of chemicals, both synthetic and natural, were capable of
increasing the incidence of neoplasms (both malignant and benign)
(Gold et al., 1989). Numerous studies have shown that as the
experimental dose of a chemical is increased, different saturable or
inducible toxicokinetic (e.g., metabolism, uptake, excretion) and
toxicodynamic (e.g., homeostasis, receptor interactions, protein
binding, repair mechanisms) processes involved in chemical
toxicity (e.g., tumorigenicity) can be involved, which may not be
engaged at environmental exposures (Slikker et al., 2004a,b). It
seems that the high doses used were triggering different mecha-
nisms which lead to the development of neoplasms in laboratory
animals. Determining which mechanisms are operative along the
dose-response curve has important implications for interpreting
bioassay data for the purposes of predicting human risk.
The classification processes were, therefore, adapted to include
the results of the animal bioassays in determining the strength of
evidence for carcinogenicity. Induction of excess neoplasms in ro-
dents, irrespective of the dose, was taken as strong evidence for
carcinogenicity
in
humans
and
chemicals
were
categorized
accordingly. The large proportion of chemicals classified in this way
led to questioning of the validity of the assays and the overall
process (Ames and Gold, 1990). The finding that around 50% of
chemicals caused neoplasms in these assays undermines the
concept of separating chemicals into “carcinogens” and “non-car-
cinogens”. It is not logical that half the chemicals in use cause
cancer in humans particularly given the high experimental doses
used and the high incidence of background tumors in certain ro-
dent species and strains and the lack of confirmation in scores of
human epidemiology studies (Pastoor and Stevens, 2005).
8. Increasing understanding of carcinogenicity (and its
impact on risk assessment and management)
Increasing understanding of chemically-driven carcinogenic
pathways over the last several decades has progressively raised
questions regarding the relevance for human health of certain tu-
mor findings in rodent bioassays. Given the issues and debates
around the human relevance and dose response of rodent tumors,
advances in knowledge of chemical carcinogenesis, and emerging
cost and time-effective methods to investigate modes of action
(MOAs), the international need for harmonized guidance on how to
look at mode of action information in cancer assessment was
recognized. Work under the auspices of the WHO International
Programme for Chemical Safety (IPCS) began in the 1990's to
develop a weight of evidence framework (Sonich-Mullin et al.,
2001). In the first stage of the framework one determines
whether it is possible to establish an MOA for the animal tumor(s)
under investigation by identifying a series of key events along the
causal pathway to cancer using a weight-of-evidence approach
based on the Bradford Hill considerations. The key events are
compared first qualitatively and then quantitatively between those
which would occur in the experimental animals and those which
would occur in humans. Finally, a clear statement of confidence,
analysis, and implications for risk assessment is produced.
The resulting IPCS mode of action framework was an important
development in moving cancer assessment away from a phenom-
enological approach and toward enabling the integration of a fuller
biological understanding of how chemicals induce neoplasia and a
better understanding of the dose response relationships. Shortly
afterwards, the IPCS framework was expanded to address how
MOA knowledge can be used to evaluate the human relevance of
animal responses based on species concordance analyzes (Meek
et al., 2003; Boobis et al., 2006). In the early mid 2000‘s, the
approach was extended to evaluate non-cancer endpoints and life
stage information (Boobis et al., 2008; Seed et al., 2005) and to
incorporate the quantitative consideration of dose response (Julien
et al., 2009; Simon et al., 2014). IPCS has now updated the frame-
work to consolidate the international work that had been done and
to emphasize that MoA analyzes should be problem formulation-
based recognizing that MOA knowledge can inform different risk
management decisions: priority setting, read across, or guiding
research, not just for risk assessment where it has been most
frequently used (Meek et al., 2014).
When using this approach for assessing carcinogenicity, there
are three broad outcomes which have an impact on how the
chemical should be further evaluated:
� Rodent carcinogens that are considered relevant for humans and
which have mode(s) of action indicating that there is no pre-
sumption of a threshold for the dose response.
� Rodent carcinogens that are considered relevant for humans and
which have a mode(s) of action indicating that there is a
threshold for the dose response. These often result from modes
of action associated with the high experimental treatment doses
that result in secondary processes (e.g., sustained cytotoxicity
and compensatory hyperplasia) where a no effect level or
margin of safety can be established. A substantial number of
chemicals have been shown to fall into this group including the
pesticides acifluorfen sodium, amitrole, captan, cyproconazole,
folpet, lactofen, and pyroxasulfone (EPA, 2015)
� Rodent carcinogens that are considered to have mode(s) of ac-
tion not relevant for humans. A number of chemicals induce
tumors by modes of action well documented to be non-relevant
to humans. Some examples are: kidney tumors in male rats
associated with substances causing a2u-globulin nephropathy;
pheochromocytomas in male rats exposed to particulates
through inhalation secondary to hypoxemia; Leydig cell ade-
nomas induced by dopamine antagonists or gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH); certain thyroid tumors in rodents
mediated by UDP glucuronyltransferase (UGT) induction (listed
in the Classification Guidelines by ECHA, 2012).
The process for the assessment of the carcinogenicity of chem-
icals by many regulatory authorities or organisations has incorpo-
rated the concept that different modes of action have different
implications for human safety. Examples are:
8.1. US EPA
The US EPA (2005) revised their Cancer Risk Assessment
Guidelines to bring in more relevant science in the cancer risk
assessment process by incorporating a framework for analyzing
mode of action (consistent with the WHO IPCS approach). The US
EPA also replaced their cancer categories with descriptors and
weight of evidence narratives, and to acknowledge that carcino-
gens should be considered in ways appropriate to their full hazard
and risk characterization. In the absence of data, the US EPA takes a
public health protective position that animal tumor findings are
A.R. Boobis et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 82 (2016) 158e166
161
 assumed to be relevant to humans, and cancer risks are assumed to
conform with the default hypothesis of non-threshold, low dose
linearity. However, sufficient, scientifically justifiable mode of ac-
tion information can support different conclusions. Non-linear dose
response modelling may be appropriate. In some cases, the animal
tumors are concluded to be not relevant to humans and thus not to
be used in human risk assessment. These considerations are re-
flected in the descriptors which the EPA applies. More than one
descriptor can be used when an agent's effects differ by dose or
exposure route. For example, an agent may be “Carcinogenic to
Humans” by one exposure route but “Not Likely to Be Carcinogenic”
by a route by which it is not absorbed. Also, an agent could be
“Likely to Be Carcinogenic” above a specified dose but “Not Likely to
Be Carcinogenic” below that dose because a key event in tumor
formation does not occur below that dose. These are descriptors
which enable the US EPA to apply the appropriate risk assessment
methodology.
8.2. ACGIH
The American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists
(ACGIH, 2016) has developed categories which describe different
classifications based on the concept that different modes of action
have different implications for human safety:
� A1 e Confirmed human carcinogen
� A2 e Suspected human carcinogen
� A3 e Animal carcinogen. The agent is not likely to cause cancer
in humans except under uncommon or unlikely routes or levels
of exposure. The agent is carcinogenic in experimental animals
at a relatively high dose, by route(s) of administration, at site(s),
of histologic type(s), or by mechanism(s) that may not be rele-
vant to worker exposure.
� A4 e Not classifiable as a human carcinogen
� A5 e Not suspected as a human carcinogen
8.3. UK CoC
The United Kingdom Committee on Carcinogenicity (CoC, 2012)
developed a decision tree approach which takes into account the
mode of action in the way the hazard is characterized and the risk
assessed before risk management decisions are taken. The decision
tree reviews the carcinogenicity data and leads to one of three
conclusions:
� Exposure should be as low as reasonably possible for substances
with a genotoxic mode of action
� Exposure should be below a level set using identification of
critical end points and use of uncertainty factors for substances
with other modes of action considered relevant to humans.
� Exposure should be below levels determined by consideration of
non-carcinogenicity end-points for substances with modes of
action for carcinogenicity considered non-relevant to humans.
8.4. SCOEL
The EU Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits
(SCOEL) set criteria to include mode of action and strength of
available data to provide input to the management of carcinogens
(Bolt and Huici-Montagud, 2008):
A) Non-threshold genotoxic carcinogens; for low-dose assess-
ment of risk, the linear non-threshold (LNT) model appears
appropriate. For these chemicals, regulations (risk manage-
ment) may be based on the ALARA principle (“as low as
reasonably achievable”), technical feasibility, and other
socio-political considerations.
B) Genotoxic carcinogens, for which the existence of a threshold
cannot be sufficiently supported at present. In these cases,
the LNT model may be used as a default assumption, based
on the scientific uncertainty.
C) Genotoxic carcinogens with a practical threshold, as sup-
ported by studies on mechanisms and/or toxicokinetics;
health-based exposure limits may be based on an established
NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level).
D) Non-genotoxic carcinogens and non-DNA-reactive carcino-
gens; for these compounds a true (“perfect”) threshold is
associated with a clearly founded NOAEL.
Each of these modern schemes derives the dose which is pre-
dicted to be of concern, or not, in humans based on the concept that
different modes of action have different implications for human
safety.
9. Unchanged processes become outmoded
Although it has not modified its categories since 1971, IARC
currently makes no claim that its role is anything other than
hazard-identification; “These categories refer only to the strength of
the evidence that an exposure is carcinogenic and not to the extent of
its carcinogenic activity (potency).” (IARC, 2015a). However, on
occasion, IARC has pronounced on the risk of some of the carci-
nogenic hazards that they have identified (IARC, 2015b).
The EU Classification and Labelling Guidelines (ECHA, 2012)
uses a system based on the strength of evidence for hazard-
identification as a “carcinogen”. The guidelines allow for a chemi-
cal to be classified as not a carcinogen if a mode of action can be
established to be not relevant to humans. However, for carcinogens
that are considered relevant for humans, the system does not
distinguish between those which have a mode of action indicating
that there is a presumption of no threshold for the dose response
and those which have a mode of action indicating that there is a
threshold for the dose response.
Categorization of carcinogenicity of agents (e.g., commodity or
pesticide chemicals, food additives, viruses, or natural products) by
the strength of evidence (e.g., animal cancer bioassays, epidemi-
ology, other experimental in vitro and in vivo) without consider-
ation of mode of action, dose-response and human exposure can
result in agents being placed into the same category that vary
widely in their likelihood to cause cancer. It has been suggested
that the EU GHS process could be improved by including potency in
a weight of evidence approach using methods which are already
part of the EU Classification, Labeling and Packaging guidelines
relating to the presence of substances classified as carcinogens in
mixtures and preparations (Hennes et al., 2014).
10. Problems resulting from use of outmoded processes
The problems caused by hazard-identification classification
schemes are complex and they have consequences for many parts
of society. The original intent of these schemes was to identify
chemicals or other agents which may be of concern and thus
require further evaluation including full risk assessments to
determine if action would be needed to mitigate a risk. We see this
process working in the strategy used by the EPA (EPA, 2005) and UK
Committee on Carcinogenicity (CoC, 2012) where the initial hazard-
identification as a carcinogen triggers a logical and scientific
consideration of the risk to human health which takes into account
A.R. Boobis et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 82 (2016) 158e166
162
 the potency, the mode of action and the magnitude, duration, fre-
quency and route of exposure. Appropriate risk mismanagement
decisions can then be made which can range from taking no action,
using personal protective equipment, decreasing personal expo-
sure, restrictions on use, to outright banning of use in extreme
circumstances.
However, all too often the public response to the classification
by hazard-identification alone is not so reasoned. For example IARC
classification as “carcinogenic to humans”, “probably carcinogenic
to humans” or “possibly carcinogenic to humans” can all lead to
negative publicity and a “health scare”. The “health scare” can
trigger anxiety and lead to behavior which is detrimental to actu-
ally achieving desirable public health goals (Berry, 2016). Govern-
ment and other agencies then have to use precious resources to
respond because of publicly perceived rather than actual threats.
Several organisations have had to explain to the public what
IARC does in attempts to alleviate unnecessary concern (Health
Canada, 2016; Cancer Research UK, 2012). As an example, Cancer
Research UK sums up what IARC does: “Just because something is in
IARC's top level category, it doesn't necessarily mean it's public health
number one e it's more complex than that. IARC does ‘hazard identi-
fication’, not ‘risk assessment’. That sounds quite technical, but what it
means is that IARC isn't in the business of telling us how potent
something is in causing cancer e only whether it does so or not. To take
an analogy, think of banana skins. They definitely can cause accidents
e but in practice this doesn't happen very often (unless you work in a
banana factory). And the sort of harm you can come to from slipping
on a banana skin isn't generally as severe as, say, being in a car ac-
cident. But under a hazard identification system like IARC's, ‘banana
skins’ and ‘cars’ would come under the same category e they both
definitely do cause accidents.”
Cancer Research UK (2012) explains that “IARC categories are
designed to flag things up to policy makers, so they can then analyse
the scale of the problem, weigh the risks against the benefits, and bring
in appropriate legislation.” IARC sometimes assesses chemicals after
they have already been considered in detail for both potential
hazard and risk by stringent agencies responsible for regulation,
such as US EPA, EFSA, ECHA, JMPR, PMRA. This lack of coordination
and co-operation can lead to problems, confusion, duplication of
efforts, and the expenditure of unnecessary resources. A recent
example of this has arisen with the herbicide glyphosate. The Eu-
ropean Food Safety Authority has completed an extensive review of
its original evaluation following a second mandate from the Euro-
pean Commission (EFSA, 2015) to consider the findings from IARC's
classification of glyphosate as “a probable human carcinogen” (IARC,
2015a,b), They came to the conclusion that “glyphosate is unlikely to
pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans and the evidence does not
support classification with regard to its carcinogenic potential” (EFSA
2015). Oddly, IARC reviewers have chosen to dispute the findings of
the EFSA process and criticize EFSA for “an over-reliance on non-
publicly available industry-provided studies using a limited set of as-
says that define the minimum data necessary for the marketing of a
pesticide” (Portier et al., 2015). In the case of pesticides, it is the legal
responsibility of the regulated industry to provide all the studies
needed to establish the safety of their products. Extensive data are
legally mandated by regulatory authorities to enable them to
evaluate efficacy and safety, and these data are generated in
accordance with Good Laboratory Practice and a series of interna-
tionally harmonized and scientifically peer-reviewed study pro-
tocols, designed to maintain a high standard of scientific quality
and consistency, and to provide confidence that study results are
repeatable and acceptable. So it should not be surprising that there
are large databases of studies sponsored by pesticides registrants
given the legal and regulatory requirements by authorities, who
have access to all the raw data. It is noteworthy that based on an
weight of evidence approach that evaluates the consistency, dose
response, time course, and biological plausibility of all relevant
evidence, JMPR concluded that glyphosate “is unlikely to pose a
carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet” (JMPR,
2016). EPA recently articulated its proposed conclusions that “The
strongest support is for “not likely to be carcinogenic to humans at
doses relevant to human health risk assessment.”” (EPA, 2016).
The EU classification system can also cause problems because
there are automatic risk management consequences built into
downstream regulations. These are exemplified in the EU Directive
on the regulation of crop protection products (EU, 2009). This
regulation applies so-called cut off criteria which do not allow any
products categorized as category 1A or 1B carcinogens to be
registered for use. This is an example of a process where hazard-
identification goes directly to risk management without going
through hazard characterization and risk assessment, even though
the regulations demand that a full toxicological and exposure data
set be produced and a risk assessment be performed for every
requested use. In many cases, a risk assessment using the modern
approaches would show that different modes of action have
different implications for human safety and would therefore impact
the regulatory decision.
Chemicals and other agents, particularly those that are in
widespread use that are flagged by classification processes based
on hazard-identification alone tend to come under close scrutiny
and become the subject of debate and concerted public campaigns.
For instance the IARC classification of glyphosate has given rise to
headlines such as “War in Europe- Battle over Glyphosate” (Genetic
Literacy Project, 2016), “EU scientists in row over safety of Glyph-
osate weedkiller” Guardian (2016), and “How the World Health
Organization's cancer agency confuses consumers” (Reuters, 2016).
The listing of a chemical by these hazard-identification only based
schemes can have major implications either because of down-
stream regulation or because of the reputational damage which can
be caused as a consequence of a distorted and misled public
perception. Useful chemicals can be lost by attrition even without
regulatory intervention, because of unfounded changes in public
behavior and precautionary reaction of industry. In many cases, the
categorization of a chemical by hazard-identification alone diverts
effort and funding into research projects which continue long after
the chemical has been determined not to pose a risk to humans or
effective risk management actions have been taken. For instance,
the NCI bioassay on chloroform was published in 1976 (NCI, 1976)
but over 90 papers have been published concerning its carcinoge-
nicity (PubMed, 2016). As recently as 2010, Take et al. (2010)
investigated interactions in kinetics of chloroform via the oral
and inhalation routes in an attempt to put the results of the original
high dose oral dosing based bioassay into the context of human
exposure which is mainly by inhalation or via the dermal route
(Take et al., 2010).
11. Problem formulation: what problem is being addressed?
“The mere formulation of a problem is far more essential than its
solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or
experimental skill. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to
regard old problems from a new angle require creative imagination
and marks real advances in science.” e Albert Einstein (1938).
Formulating the problem being addressed is key to solving it.
Which problems are the hazard-identification based classification
systems trying to address?
In the 1970s the problem could have been formulated as
“identify those chemicals which are capable of causing cancer so
they can be eliminated from use”. The processes put into place
based on this problem formulation were set up in favor of
A.R. Boobis et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 82 (2016) 158e166
163
 identifying carcinogens, i.e. set up to minimize false negatives. The
problem was formulated with the assumption that there would be a
relatively small number of carcinogens which could be detected
with reasonable reliability and did not foresee that there would
turn out to be various mechanisms of carcinogenicity with different
implications for risk assessment and risk management, and that a
number of these would be specific to rodents. Most of the chemicals
identified up to that time were potent DNA-reactive (genotoxic)
carcinogens that produced cancer in both rodent models and in
humans, such as aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons, nitrosamines and aflatoxins. These were believed to not have
a threshold. With the development of the two year rodent bioassay
incorporating an MTD, numerous chemicals were identified as
carcinogenic that were non-DNA reactive (non-genotoxic). Their
cancer modes of action considered to be secondary consequence of
their toxicity (e.g. sustained cytotoxicity or cell proliferation) and
were considered to have a threshold. Subsequent research has
shown that many produce cancer in rodents by a mode of action not
relevant to humans. If relevant to humans, the presence of a
threshold presents a completely different dose response and risk
assessment than the DNA reactive carcinogens. Hazard-based sys-
tems do not distinguish these, even though potency and human risk
are vastly different.
Hazard-identification based classification systems could have a
part to play in addressing an updated problem formulation as an
early warning or priority setting measure. There could be value if
the processes used were rapid and were undertaken before more
detailed risk assessment is completed and if they were acknowl-
edged to provide a preliminary evaluation which would subse-
quently be refined as necessary. However, the current hazard-
identification based systems are not treated as preliminary as-
sessments leading to the problems which have been described in
section 10.
Systems which are designed to place as many chemicals as
possible into the most severe category are ultimately self-defeating.
At first sight this could appear to be a benefit. More chemicals will
be classified in the most severe category and would be subjected to
stringent risk management, which in a hazard-identification only
system means no exposure. This could be achieved at a fraction of
the cost simply by assuming that all chemicals are carcinogens. But
placing more and more chemicals into the most extreme category
will have a severe unintended effect. In fact, when only the most
hazardous chemicals are identified, the classification is respected
and appropriate risk management decisions are taken, especially in
those sectors where banning or withdrawal is not mandatory.
However, if too many chemicals are placed into the most hazardous
category, including those which do not represent an extreme risk,
the distinction is lost, and respect for the system is eroded
(American Cancer Society, 2016).
Many sectors will find it hard to operate by excluding all
chemicals in this category and chemicals truly hazardous by
adverse effects other than carcinogenicity may not be excluded or
managed appropriately, thereby having the opposite effect from
the intended one. For example, many chemicals that are natural
components of various foods produce cancer in rodents at high
doses, including substances in fruits and vegetables, which most
people consider positive enhancers to health (Ames and Gold,
1990). Likewise, more than half of currently approved prescrip-
tion pharmaceuticals are carcinogenic in rodent bioassay, and yet,
based on a risk assessment rather than a hazard-based analysis,
they benefit millions of grateful patients, with little or no risk of
cancer (Brambilla et al., 2012).
It is now time to revise the problem formulation statement
along the lines of “identify and characterize the carcinogenic po-
tential of chemicals so that appropriate risk management measures
can be taken to safeguard human health.”
This is the direction being taken by several national and inter-
national initiatives (e.g., Health Canada, 2000; WHO IPCS, 2010;
EFSA, 2013). The US EPA Framework for Human Health Risk
Assessment to Inform Decision Making (EPA, 2014) outlines a
stepwise approach that goes through Planning and scoping; Prob-
lem formulation; Risk assessment; Exposure and effects assess-
ment
(including
hazard-identification
and
dose
response
assessment); Risk characterization; Public, stakeholder and com-
munity involvement; Informing decisions. The RISK21 process
(Embry et al., 2014) emphasizes the importance of problem
formulation, the use of existing data, and tiered assessment of
exposure and then hazard in safety assessment.
Much has been achieved by international co-operation in
advancing risk assessment it is now time for the categorization of
carcinogenicity to be the subject of such an initiative. The WHO
International Programme for Chemical Safety last reviewed classi-
fication schemes in 1995 (IPCS, 1995) and recognized the need to
consider a range of issues which would need resolution to solve the
problem of diverging classification schemes. These issues have
been clarified in the intervening 20 years, and it is now the time to
heed the call in the Lancet (Lancet, 2016) for an international
initiative to develop a standardized, internationally agreed upon
methodology for carcinogen assessment, coupled with tools for
presenting results that are easily understood and accepted by all
interested parties.
12. Reproductive toxicology and endocrine disruption
This paper has focused on cancer but there are other areas of
toxicology in which hazard-identification based classification sys-
tems exist, with similar untoward consequences. The classification
system for reproductive and developmental toxicity in the EU is
also a hazard-identification based system (Hennes et al., 2014).
Classification as a Category 1A (known human reprotoxicant) or 1B
(presumed human reprotoxicant) will trigger downstream auto-
matic extreme risk management measures for some uses of
chemicals, for instance plant protection products (EU, 2009) using
the so-called “cut-off” criteria. This causes similar problems to
those caused by the hazard-identification based system for carci-
nogenicity within the EU. For example, vitamin A at high doses is a
known human teratogen (Rothman et al., 1995). In a hazard-based
classification system it should be banned, and yet lower exposures
are essential for life. These problems are being reviewed in a
Consultation on the Regulatory Fitness of Chemicals Legislation
(EU, 2016a,b).
Recently the EU published the proposed criteria for identifying
chemicals which have the potential to cause adverse effects via
endocrine disruption, but the proposed classification does not
include an assessment of potency (EU, 2016a). It does not seem to
be sensible to introduce a new hazard-identification based system
with all the problems that entails at the same time as the EU is
reviewing the impact of such systems (EU, 2016b).
13. Conclusions
Hazard-identification based classification schemes are inade-
quate to guide appropriate risk management decisions and have
become outmoded. They are based on a concept developed in the
1970s that chemicals could be categorically divided cleanly into
two classes: carcinogens and non-carcinogens. It was postulated at
that time that a major reduction in cancer incidence would result if
carcinogens could be identified and then eliminated from use and
from the environment (Rettig, 2007). The classification that these
schemes provide is based on the strength of evidence that the
A.R. Boobis et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 82 (2016) 158e166
164
 chemical has some degree of carcinogenic potential in humans or
rodents but they do not indicate the degree of risk following real
human exposure.
Categorization by the strength of evidence that a chemical has
caused cancer in humans or in laboratory animals can place
chemicals and agents with widely differing potencies in their
ability to cause cancer and with very different modes of action into
the same category. Chemicals with seven orders of magnitude
difference in the dose required to cause cancer can be placed in the
same category. This is how eating processed meat can fall into the
same category as sulfur mustard gas.
More modern strategies based on problem formulation and
hypothesis-based approaches in a risk decision framework such as
those described by the US EPA (EPA, 2005; EPA, 2014), the UK
Committee on Carcinogenicity (CoC, 2012), the EU Scientific Com-
mittee on Occupational Exposure Limits (Bolt and Huici-Montagud,
2008) provide clearer guidance and allow informed risk manage-
ment decisions to be taken. Once carcinogenic potential has been
identified, hazard characterization then examines other factors
such as the dose response and the mode of action to be combined
with exposure assessment leading to risk assessment. Only then
can risk management actions be taken if appropriate.
The hazard and risk characterization approach avoids the un-
intended downsides of creating health scares, incurring unnec-
essary economic costs and the diversion of public funds, which
could be spent more wisely, into unnecessary research.
An international initiative to agree upon a standardized, inter-
nationally acceptable methodology for carcinogen assessment is
needed now. The approach taken should incorporate principles and
concepts of existing international consensus-based frameworks
including the WHO IPCS mode of action framework.
