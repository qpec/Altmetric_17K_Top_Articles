Abstract
Purpose: The study objective was to characterize the prognostic
performance of a novel Breast Cancer Index model (BCINþ), an
integration of BCI gene expression, tumor size, and grade, spe-
cifically developed for assessment of distant recurrence (DR) risk
in HRþ breast cancer patients with one to three positive lymph
nodes (pN1).
Experimental Design: Analysis was conducted in a well-anno-
tated retrospective series of pN1 patients (N ¼ 402) treated with
adjuvant endocrine therapy with or without chemotherapy using
a prespecified model. The primary endpoint was time-to-DR.
Results were determined blinded to clinical outcome. Kaplan-
Meier estimates of overall (0–15 years) and late (�5 years) DR,
HRs, and 95% confidence interval (CIs) were estimated. Likeli-
hood ratio statistics assessed relative contributions of prognostic
information.
Results: BCINþ classified 81 patients (20%) as low risk with a
15-year DR rate of 1.3% (95% CI, 0.0%–3.7%) versus 321
patients as high risk with a DR rate of 29.0% (95% CI, 23.2%–
34.4%). In patients DR-free for �5 years (n ¼ 349), the late
DR rate was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.0%–3.7%) and 16.1% (95% CI,
10.6%–21.3%) in low- and high-risk groups, respectively. BCI
gene expression alone was significantly prognostic (DLR-c2 ¼
20.12; P < 0.0001). Addition of tumor size (DLR-c2 ¼ 13.29,
P ¼ 0.0003) and grade (DLR-c2 ¼ 12.72; P ¼ 0.0004) significantly
improved prognostic performance. BCI added significant prog-
nostic information to tumor size (DLR-c2 ¼ 17.55; P < 0.0001);
addition to tumor grade was incremental (DLR-c2 ¼ 2.38; P ¼
0.1) with considerable overlap between prognostic values
(DLR-c2 ¼ 17.74).
Conclusions: The integrated BCINþ identified 20% of pN1
patients with limited risk of recurrence over 15 years, in whom
extended endocrine treatment may be spared. Ongoing studies
will characterize combined clinical-genomic risk assessment in
node-positive patients. Clin Cancer Res; 23(23); 7217–24. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Improvements in patient outcomes with prolonged endo-
crine therapy are supported by several studies of hormone
receptor–positive (HRþ) breast cancer patients (1–5). Howev-
er, as extended adjuvant treatment is increasingly adopted,
better methods to estimate risks and benefits are important to
balance efficacy with potential toxicities and tolerability issues
to ensure the best health outcomes for patients that may be
receiving anti-estrogen therapy for up to 10 years. Lymph
node–positive (LNþ) disease is associated with approximately
twice the risk of recurrence over 10 years compared with lymph
node–negative (LN�) disease (6, 7), and thus the standard of
care includes more intensive treatment regimens such as adju-
vant chemotherapy and consideration of extended endocrine
therapy for these patients. In findings from large randomized
studies in LNþ patients, adjuvant chemotherapy and extended
endocrine therapy have been shown to reduce the 10-year
absolute risk of recurrence by approximately 9% and 3%,
respectively (2, 8). However, a substantial subset (>60%) of
LNþ patients remain disease free for 10 or more years when
treated with 5 years of endocrine therapy only with or without
adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, accurate assessment of
individualized risk is an important goal, particularly with
regard to LNþ patients, because nodal status is weighed heavily
relative to other clinicopathologic parameters for guiding more
aggressive treatment.
Use of molecular assays to assess prognosis and predict
response to therapy in addition to traditional clinicopathologic
characteristics are of great interest across many cancer types. The
Breast Cancer Index (BCI) is a gene-expression signature devel-
oped from the combination of two biomarkers: the HOXB13:
IL17BR expression ratio (H/I) and the Molecular Grade Index
(MGI; ref. 9). H/I is a biomarker that is associated with response to
endocrine therapy in ERþ breast cancer, and MGI consists of the
average expression of five cell cycle–associated genes and provides
quantitative and objective molecular assessment of tumor grade
and proliferative status. In previous studies, BCI was demonstrat-
ed to significantly stratify patients with breast cancer with LN�
disease based on the risk of early (0–5 years), late (5–10 years),
and overall (cumulative 0–10 years) distant recurrence (9, 10).
A number of genomic biomarkers have demonstrated strong
prognostic ability in LN� patients; however, the prognostic value

 of gene expression alone is reportedly attenuated in LNþ patients
(11–13). Notably, recent studies within LNþ cohorts have dem-
onstrated that integration of clinicopathologic factors with molec-
ular scores improved and strengthened prognostic performance
compared with molecular scores alone (14, 15). The objective of
this study was to evaluate an optimized model that integrated BCI
gene expression with clinicopathologic factors (tumor size and
grade) for the prognostic assessment of risk of distant recurrence
specifically in patients with ERþ breast cancer with one to three
positive lymph nodes (pN1).
Materials and Methods
Patient characteristics and tumor samples
A distinct recurrence risk model (BCINþ), as well as its pre-
specified cut-point, for patients with pN1 disease was previously
developed using Cox proportional hazards regression integrating
BCI, tumor size, and grade using ERþ pN1 patients as described
previously (16). The performance of this BCINþ model was
assessed in a well-annotated retrospective case series from a single
academic institution [Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH),
Boston, MA] that was constructed on the basis of prespecified
inclusion criteria and intended to validate the prognostic perfor-
mance of BCINþ. The criteria included women with HRþ, invasive
pN1 breast cancer diagnosed between 1993 and 2007 who
received adjuvant endocrine therapy with or without chemother-
apy, had at least 5 years of follow-up, and had available FFPE
tumor blocks. Corresponding clinical andpathologic information
collected included age; tumor size; tumor grade; tumor histology;
number of positive lymph nodes; ER, PR, and HER2 status;
surgery type; chemotherapy treatment; endocrine therapy regi-
men and duration of endocrine therapy; and time to any local,
regional, or distant disease recurrences. All women were followed
up until distant recurrence or last documented follow-up visit. A
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slide for each case was centrally
reviewed to confirm tumor grade according to the Nottingham
system. ER, PR, and HER2 statuses were centrally determined via
IHC through pathology report review. ER and PR positivity was
determined using a cut-off level of 10% nuclear staining of tumor
cells (clinical practice standard at the time), whereas HER2
positivity was defined as IHC 3þ and/or FISH HER2/NEU gene
amplified. The methods for lymph node assessment (sentinel
lymph node biopsy alone vs. axillary lymph node dissection) were
not collected. The investigation of the collected tumor samples
was approved by the Institutional Review Board at MGH. In
accordance with the approval, informed consent from patients
was not required. The study was conducted in accordance with the
U.S. Common Rule.
Breast cancer index assay
Gene expression analysis of FFPE specimens was performed at
Biotheranostics, Inc., blinded to clinical outcome. For each case,
three 10-mm tissue sections were cut, and an H&E slide was used to
confirm 40% content of invasive cancer before manual macro-
dissection to enrich tumor content for RNA extraction. Total RNA
was reverse transcribed and the resulting cDNA was preamplified
using the PreAmp Master Mix Kit per the manufacturer's instruc-
tions (Applied Biosystems), followed by TaqMan RT-PCR as
previously described (17). H/I, MGI, and BCI were calculated as
described previously, blinded to all other variables (9, 17, 18).
Precision/reproducibility of the BCI assay was completed under
quality system regulation (QSR) as part of the clinical laboratory
(CLIA) quality management process and has been reported pre-
viously (9). Reproducibility of FFPE sections within blocks was
assessed by two serial sections within the same block from 10
patients. The mean within-block SD for the BCINþ score was 0.06
BCI-unit [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.0–0.14].
Study endpoints
The primary objective was to evaluate the prognostic per-
formance of the BCINþ model for overall and late (post 5
years) distant recurrence in an independent cohort of patients
with pN1 disease. The primary endpoint was time to distant
recurrence, defined as the time from diagnosis to the time of
first metastasis at distant organs. Death before distant recur-
rence was considered a censoring event. Locoregional recur-
rences were not considered either as events or as censoring
events. Secondary endpoints included time to any recurrences
(locoregional or distant, whichever occurred first). Late distant
recurrences were defined as distant recurrences occurring after
5 years from diagnosis and were evaluated within the subset
of patients who had remained distant recurrence free for at
least 5 years.
Statistical considerations and analyses
It was calculated that a minimum of approximately 226
patients was required to detect an absolute 20% difference in
10-year distant recurrence rate between the two BCINþ risk
groups with 80% power at 5% significance level, assuming 20%
of patients would be classified as low-risk with 10-year risk of
distant recurrence of 5%. The BCINþ model (with scores
reported ranging from 0.0 to 10.0), assay cut-points, and all
analyses were prespecified and blinded to clinical outcomes.
The change in likelihood ratio statistics (DLR-c2) was used to
represent the additional prognostic information of gene expres-
sion over clinicopathologic factors, and vice versa in a bar
graph, with the remaining likelihood ratio statistic representing
the overlap in prognostic information between the two. Distant
recurrence–free survival for the two prespecified risk groups was

Translational Relevance
The Breast Cancer Index (BCI) is a gene expression–based
signature originally developed for node-negative patients. This
study describes the evaluation of an optimized model
(BCINþ) that integrates tumor size and grade with gene
expression to enhance prognostic performance in hormone
receptor–positive (HRþ) patients with breast cancer with one
to three positive lymph nodes (pN1). Findings showed that
BCINþ identified a substantial proportion of women with pN1
disease who had a limited risk of distant recurrence over a 15-
year follow-up period. In the context of increasing use of
extended durations of endocrine therapy, these results showed
that the prognostic value of combining clinicopathologic and
genomic factors may have clinical impact in terms of improv-
ing individualized risk stratification for patients with pN1
disease. Women categorized as BCINþ low risk may be suffi-
ciently treated by adjuvant endocrine therapy � chemotherapy
and spared extended adjuvant endocrine therapy.

 equality of the survival curves was evaluated with the log-rank
test. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to
evaluate whether BCINþ as a continuous risk index provided
prognostic information independent of other relevant factors
(i.e., age, PR status, chemotherapy, duration of endocrine
therapy, and type of endocrine therapy) using likelihood ratio
tests. Patients with missing data on the covariates were exclud-
ed from the multivariate analyses. Interquartile hazard ratios
(HRs) for continuous BCINþ corresponding to a change from
the 25th to 75th percentile of the distribution, and correspond-
ing 95% CIs, were provided. A receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve was generated to assess the discriminative power
of BCINþ for distant recurrence using 15 years as the censoring
time point; patients with <15 years of follow-up and no
recurrence were excluded. Concordance index (c-index) was
also estimated to assess the predictive ability of BCINþ for
distant recurrence–free survival. A two-sided P value of less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses
were performed using R statistical package (version 3.1.3,
http://www.r-project.org).
Results
Patient and tumor characteristics
Patient and tumor characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Of
the 402 cases that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were
included in the study cohort, 39% were <50 years old and 61%
were �50 years old. The majority of cases (81%) were treated with
adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) or AC-T (AC
followed by paclitaxel)–based chemotherapy. For adjuvant endo-
crine therapy, 191 (48%) patients received tamoxifen only, 69
(17%) received an aromatase inhibitor (AI) only, and 142 (35%)
received a sequence of tamoxifen and an AI. A total of 276 patients
were treated with up to 5 years of endocrine therapy, whereas 126
patients received more than 5 years of endocrine therapy. There
was no relationship between tumor size and treatment duration,
although a smaller proportion of patients that received more than
5 years of endocrine therapy were grade 3 (16%) compared with
patients that received �5 years (30%). A majority of patients had
ductal histology (86%), and most patients had one (58%) or two
(26%) positive nodes. The cohort included 17% grade 1, 56%
grade 2, and 26% grade 3, 62% �2 cm, and 38% >2 cm, and the
proportion of distant recurrences that occurred early (<5 years)
versus late (�5 years) were similar. There were 87 (22% of
patients) distant recurrences, 44% of which occurred more than
5 years after diagnosis (i.e., late recurrence). Patient characteristics
in patients with early versus late recurrences are shown in Sup-
plementary Table S1. Median follow-up was 12 years, with 78
patients (33% of event-free population) having �15 years of
follow-up.
Performance evaluation of BCINþ for overall and late distant
recurrence
BCINþ significantly stratified patients into low-risk and high-
risk groups for both overall (P < 0.0001) and late (P ¼ 0.0014)
distant recurrence (Fig. 1A and B). The median follow-up was 12
years, and all follow up was censored at 15 years. For overall
distant recurrence, BCINþ classified 20% of patients (N ¼ 81) into
a low-risk group with a 15-year risk of distant recurrence of 1.3%
(95% CI, 0.0%–3.7%), whereas 15-year risk for the BCINþ high-
risk group was 29.0% (23.2%–34.4%), giving an HR of 25.93
(95% CI, 3.61–186.22; Fig. 1A). Patients (n ¼ 349) who remained
distant recurrence free for at least 5 years were analyzed for late
(post 5 year) recurrence. Of these, 23% were classified as BCINþ
low risk. Risk of distant recurrence in years 5 to 15 was 1.3% (95%
CI, 0.0%–3.7%) versus 16.1% (95% CI, 10.6%–21.3%) in the
low- and high-risk groups, respectively (Fig. 1B). Patients in the
BCINþ high-risk group had 12.39-fold (95% CI, 1.7–90.35)
greater risk for late distant recurrence compared with the patients
in the low-risk group. For the prespecified secondary endpoint of
all recurrences, including locoregional recurrences, the BCINþ
low-risk group had a 15-year risk of 3.6% for both overall and late
recurrence (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
The nonlinearity of BCINþ was assessed by restricted cubic
spline, quadratic, and cubic transformation using a likelihood

 ratio test, which showed that there was no nonlinear effect (P ¼
0.45, 0.37, and 0.53, respectively). As a continuous variable,
predefined BCINþ was a highly significant prognostic factor,
with an interquartile HR of 2.14 (95% CI, 1.56–2.94; P <
0.0001) and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.13–2.09; P ¼ 0.006) for overall
and late distant recurrence, respectively. Multivariate analysis
adjusting for age, PR status, chemotherapy treatment, duration
of endocrine treatment (>5-year vs. �5-year), type of endocrine
treatment (any AI versus tamoxifen) and number of positive
lymph nodes showed that BCINþ remained the most significant
prognostic factor, with an HR of 1.81 (95% CI, 1.33–2.45; P <
0.0001) and 1.41 (95% CI, 1.06–1.89; P ¼ 0.02) for overall and
late distant recurrence, respectively. Duration of endocrine
therapy, type of endocrine therapy, and number of positive
nodes were also statistically significant in the multivariate
analysis with BCINþ included (Supplementary Table S2). The
10-year and 15-year risk of distant recurrence estimated as a
linear variable from the Cox model increased monotonically as
the BCINþ scores increased for both overall and late distant
recurrence (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S2). ROC analyses of
continuous BCINþ in all patients showed AUCs of 0.76 for 15-
year distant recurrences in both all patients and those treated
with �5 years of endocrine therapy (Supplementary Fig. S3A
and S3B), and AUCs of 0.82 and 0.9, respectively, for 15-year
distant recurrences in the HER2-negative subset (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S3C and S3D). The c-index was 0.72 for both all
patients and those treated with �5 years of endocrine therapy
and was 0.78 and 0.80 for all HER2-negative patients and those
HER2-negative but treated with �5 years of endocrine therapy,
respectively.
Performance evaluation in clinical subsets
The interaction between BCINþ and whether patients received
more than 5 years endocrine therapy or not did not show statis-
tical significance (P ¼ 0.25 and 0.90 for overall and late distant
recurrence, respectively). In the subset of patients that received �5
years of endocrine therapy (n ¼ 276), BCINþ significantly sepa-
rated the patients into low-risk and high-risk groups for both
overall (P < 0.0001) and late (P ¼ 0.0067) distant recurrence (Fig.
1C and D). For overall distant recurrence, BCINþ classified 18%
patients into a low-risk group with a 15-year risk of distant
recurrence of 2.1% (95% CI, 0.0%–6.0%), whereas 15-year risk
for the BCINþ high-risk group was 36.8% (95% CI, 29.3%–
43.4%) with an HR of 21.88 (95% CI, 3.04–157.32; Fig. 1C).
Of the patients that were distant recurrence free for at least 5 years,
22% were classified as BCINþ low risk. Risk of distant recurrence at
year 15 was 2.1% (95% CI, 0.0%–6.0%) versus 19.0% (95% CI,
11.6%–25.8%) in the low- and high-risk groups, respectively
(Fig. 1D). Patients in the BCINþ high-risk group had 9.49-fold
(95% CI, 1.29–69.7) increased risk for late distant recurrence as
the patients in the low-risk group. The secondary endpoint of all
recurrences is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D.
Several prespecified subset analyses were performed to assess
BCINþ in clinically relevant subgroups. First, within the subset of
259 HER2-negative patients, 57 patients (22%) were classified as
low risk by BCINþ, and this group had no distant recurrences over

 the 15 years of follow-up (Supplementary Fig. S4). HER2�
patients in the BCINþ high-risk group had significantly higher
risk of overall (0–15 years) and late (5–15 years) distant recur-
rence of 29.1% (95% CI, 21.6%–35.9%; P < 0.0001) and 17.0%
(95% CI, 9.8%–23.7%; P ¼ 0.0037), respectively. Prognostic
performance of BCINþ by the number of positive nodes was also
examined (Supplementary Fig. S5): more than half of patients
(n ¼ 231; 57%) had 1 positive node, whereas 106 patients (26%)
and 65 patients (16%) had two or three positive nodes, respec-
tively. BCINþ performed similarly across groups, with the low-risk
group having 1.7%, 0%, and 0% 15-year risk of distant recurrence
in patients with one, two, or three positive nodes, respectively. The
risk of recurrence in the BCINþ high-risk groups increased with the
number of positive nodes (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Incremental prognostic contribution of gene expression and
clinical factors
BCI gene expression alone was significantly prognostic (DLR-x2
¼ 20.12; P < 0.0001; Fig. 3). The addition of tumor size (DLR-x2 ¼
13.29; P ¼ 0.0003) and grade (DLR-x2 ¼ 12.72; P ¼ 0.0004)
individually or combined (DLR-x2¼22.28; P < 0.0001) to BCI
significantly improved the prognostic performance (Fig. 3). Con-
versely, BCI added significant prognostic information to tumor
size alone (DLR-x2¼17.55; P < 0.0001; Fig. 3). However, addition
of BCI to tumor grade did not reach statistical significance in this
cohort (DLR-x2¼2.38; P ¼ 0.1) due to a large overlap between
their prognostic values (DLR-x2¼17.74), consistent with the
overlap of grade and the MGI component of BCI which evaluates
proliferative status.

 Discussion
The standard of care for patients with HRþ LNþ breast cancer
includes more intensive approaches such as adjuvant chemother-
apy and, more recently, strong consideration of extended endo-
crine therapy, based on higher overall risk of recurrence, with an
approximately 25% risk at 5 years and approximately 40% risk at
10 years compared with approximately 12% and approximately
20%, respectively, in LN� patients (6, 7). Notably, a majority of
early-stage LNþ patients do not benefit from extended endocrine
therapy. For example, in the MA.17 randomized trial, the absolute
benefit of extended endocrine therapy in LNþ patients (distant
disease–free survival) was approximately 3% with a median
follow-up of 30 months (19). Similarly, in the ATLAS randomized
trial, the absolute benefit of extended endocrine therapy in LNþ
patients was approximately 3% (2). Recently disclosed primary
data from the MA.17R and NSABP B-42 randomized trials—
which contained 51% and 43% LNþ patients, respectively, and
were the first studies to report safety and efficacy of AIs for up to 10
years—were consistent with earlier extended endocrine trials,
demonstrating an absolute benefit of approximately 3% to 4%
in terms of disease-free survival and approximately 1% to 2% in
terms of distant recurrence–free survival (5, 20). These studies
also established that longer durations of endocrine therapy were
associated with significant increases in risk of some serious
toxicities, including endometrial cancer with tamoxifen and new
osteoporosis and fractures with AIs (2, 5, 21).
Results from these extended endocrine trials raise the unmet
critical need to weigh risk versus benefit at the individual patient
level in determining duration of endocrine therapy. Traditional
methods for assessing risk of distant recurrence have used clinical
and pathologic factors such as age, tumor size, tumor grade, and
extent of nodal involvement; however, these measures can be
limited as risk estimates are based on categorical averages. For
example, in a recent Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative
Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis, pN1 patients with small tumors
(T1) had a risk of late distant recurrence of 8%, 15%, and 23%
between years 5 to 10, 5 to 15, and 5 to 20, respectively (22). Thus,
identification of patients with a limited risk of late distant recur-
rence can be challenging based on clinicopathologic factors.
The current study demonstrated that BCINþ-derived risk groups
showed distinct rates of distant recurrence based on more than 10
years of follow-up. In particular, the approximately 20% of
patients who were classified as BCINþ low risk had limited 15-
year rates of distant recurrence of <2%. Notably, these patients
have a similar risk of distant recurrence as node-negative patients
identified as low risk by BCI gene expression alone (9, 10).
Conversely, BCINþ high risk defined patients at significantly
higher risk of distant recurrence (29.0%) during 15 years of
follow-up, despite aggressive treatment that included adjuvant
chemotherapyas well as adjuvant endocrine therapy. Theseresults
are of clinical relevance and provide a basis on which to identify
patients with one to three positive nodes that may not need
extended durations of endocrine therapy. Moreover, BCINþ iden-
tified pN1 patients at low risk of recurrence regardless of whether
they had one, two, or three positive nodes (Supplementary Fig.
S5). Identification of low-risk pN1 disease was also demonstrated
in patients treated with endocrine monotherapy, albeit within the
training cohort, indicating that the BCINþ model may also have
potential utility for decision making regarding adjuvant chemo-
therapy. Although chemotherapy is recommended for almost all
women with four or more positive lymph nodes, further studies in
pN1 patients treated with endocrine therapy alone are planned to
assess the value of BCINþ to help determine the need for adjuvant
chemotherapy at the time of diagnosis.
Characterization of several genomic biomarkers has revealed
that molecular signatures have the ability to provide a substantial
amount of prognostic information when assessing node-negative
patients, but that prognostic capability is substantially enhanced
by the addition of clinicopathologic factors to molecular
approaches in node-positive patients (11–13). Consistent with
this, in previous work, BCI gene expression alone has been shown
to provide greater prognostic value than clinicopathologic factors
in LN� patients (9, 23). Findings from the current study show that
the integration of tumor size and grade statistically enhanced the
prognostic performance of BCINþ compared with BCI gene
expression alone (Fig. 3). These findings are consistent with
studies of other molecular biomarkers in patients with LNþ
disease. The PAM50 risk of recurrence (ROR) score (including
tumor size) and the EndoPredict EPClin score (including tumor
size and number of positive lymph nodes) both incorporate
clinical factors and molecular scores for risk assessment (11,
12). Similar to BCI in the study presented here, in a comprehen-
sive comparative analysis across biomarkers, molecular informa-
tion from PAM50 and EndoPredict alone captured substantial
prognostic information in LN� patients, whereas in patients with
LNþ disease, prognostic value was incremental when added to
clinicopathologic factors (11–13). As a result, integration of
molecular information with clinicopathologic factors led to sig-
nificantly greater overall prognostic performance in LNþ patients.
Results of these studies support the notion that the most impor-
tant factors underlying disease recurrence evolve as disease pro-
gresses from LN� to LNþ disease, with anatomic and pathologic
factors potentially playing a larger role than the underlying
biology, and that optimal patient risk stratification of LNþ
patients may require the involvement of both molecular and
clinicopathologic factors.
Evaluation of the incremental contributions of gene expression
versus tumor size and grade in this cohort showed a large overlap
between BCI and tumor grade (DLR-x2¼17.74; P < 0.0001; Fig. 3).
This overlap is likely due to the proliferation-based MGI compo-
nent within BCI, as MGI was developed as molecular surrogate
for tumor grade and is composed of five cell cycle–regulation
genes (17). The implication of this finding is that tumor prolif-
erative status is the primary determinant of prognosis in this
model, however, when analyzed to evaluate what clinicopatho-
logic factors add to BCI gene expression, BCI was a highly
significant prognostic factor in the pN1 population, with size
and grade adding significant prognostic value in addition to the
molecular signature (P ¼ 0.0003 and 0.0004, respectively). Given
the variability of clinical and pathologic assessment in routine
clinical practice, incorporation of molecular factors may help to
standardize and refine risk assessment. This may be particularly
relevant for molecular assessments of proliferative status, where
marked variability has been documented in pathologic assess-
ment (24–31). Further studies in other independent cohorts are
required to adequately characterize the contribution of tumor
grade to the prognostic performance of BCINþ.
The study had several key strengths and limitations. Validation
of the BCINþ model was completed in a clinically relevant cohort,
including pre- and post-menopausal patients and patients treated
with tamoxifen and/or AIs, most with adjuvant chemotherapy. A
key limitation of the study was the use of a retrospective cohort for
Zhang et al.

 performance evaluation, though the study was prospectively
defined and blinded. In addition, information on duration of
endocrine therapy was collected in a categorical manner (�5 years
vs. >5 years), and therefore, further subset analyses based on
specific duration of endocrine therapy could not be performed.
Furthermore, the proportion of PR� patients was under-repre-
sented in this cohort compared with reported estimates in other
published studies (8, 32–34). Additional validation studies in
prospective or multicenter cohorts will strengthen the evidence
base.
In summary, findings from this study indicate that integration
of clinicopathologic and molecular factors in BCINþ has the
potential to inform treatment decisions for a substantial propor-
tion of HRþ pN1 patients—in particular, the 1 in 5 patients with
low risk of late distant recurrence. On the basis of these results,
BCINþ may provide information to facilitate selection of LNþ
patients for extended endocrine treatment. Women categorized as
BCINþ low risk appear to have been adequately treated by 5 years
of adjuvant therapy and can avoid extended adjuvant endocrine
therapy. Efforts to further refine risk assessment through the
integration of clinicopathologic and molecular biomarkers
should continue in an effort to optimize the risk-versus-benefit
assessment and individualization of care for ERþ breast cancer
patients.
