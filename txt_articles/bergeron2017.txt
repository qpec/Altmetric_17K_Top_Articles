IMPORTANCE Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome has been associated with increased
morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Previous
studies have suggested that azithromycin may reduce the incidence of post–lung transplant
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate if the early administration of azithromycin can improve airflow
decline–free survival after allogeneic HSCT.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The ALLOZITHRO parallel-group trial conducted in 19
French academic transplant centers and involving participants who were at least 16 years old,
had undergone allogeneic HSCT for a hematological malignancy, and had available
pretransplant pulmonary function test results. Enrollment was from February 2014 to August
2015 with follow-up through April 26, 2017.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive 3 times a week either 250 mg of
azithromycin (n = 243) or placebo (n = 237) for 2 years, starting at the time of the
conditioning regimen.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy end point was airflow decline–free
survival at 2 years after randomization. Main secondary end points were overall survival and
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome at 2 years.
RESULTS Thirteen months after enrollment, the independent data and safety monitoring board
detected an unanticipated imbalance across blinded groups in the number of hematological
relapses, and the treatment was stopped December 26, 2016. Among 480 randomized
participants, 465 (97%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (mean age, 52
[SD, 14] years; 75 women [35%]). At the time of data cutoff, 104 patients (22%; 54 azithromycin
vs 50 placebo) had experienced an airflow decline; 138 patients (30%) died (78 azithromycin vs
60 placebo). Two-year airflow decline–free survival was 32.8% (95% CI, 25.9%-41.7%) with
azithromycin and 41.3% (95% CI, 34.1%-50.1%) with placebo (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.3;
95% CI, 1.02-1.70; P = .03). Of the 22 patients (5%) who experienced bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome, 15 (6%) were in the azithromycin group and 7 (3%) in the placebo group (P = .08).
The azithromycin group had increased mortality, with a 2-year survival of 56.6% (95% CI,
50.2%-63.7%) vs 70.1% (95% CI, 64.2%-76.5%) in the placebo group (unadjusted HR, 1.5; 95%
CI, 1.1-2.0; P = .02). In a post hoc analysis, the 2-year cumulative incidence of hematological
relapse was 33.5% (95% CI, 27.3%-39.7%) with azithromycin vs 22.3% (95% CI, 16.4%-28.2%)
with placebo (unadjusted cause-specific HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4; P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT for
hematological malignancy, early administration of azithromycin resulted in worse airflow
decline–free survival than did placebo; these findings are limited by early trial termination.
The potential for harm related to relapse requires further investigation.

ronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after transplants,
characterized by a new-onset airflow obstruction after
either lung transplant or allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplant (HSCT), is a serious complication associ-
ated with increased morbidity and mortality.1 The patho-
physiology of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome occurring
after either lung transplant or HSCT is likely similar.1
After HSCT, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is closely
linked to chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD)2 and typically
develops within 2 years of the procedure; bronchiolitis oblit-
erans syndrome has been reported to occur in 4% to 6% of
allogeneic HSCT recipients and in up to 14% of patients
with chronic GVHD.3-6 The diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliter-
ans syndrome is based on the presence of obstructive lung
disease demonstrated by pulmonary function testing.2
Although early diagnosis is challenging, a growing body of
evidence suggests that a decrease in the forced expiratory
volume in the first second of expiration (FEV1) may occur
before the onset of obstructive lung disease.3,7,8 Bronchiolitis
obliterans syndrome, once diagnosed, is usually irreversible
despite immunosuppressive treatment. To avoid the adverse
effects of steroids, new strategies targeting the airways
are increasingly being investigated.9,10 Given the disease
severity and lack of reliable risk factors, prophylactic proto-
cols are needed.
Beyond their antibiotic effects, macrolides have immu-
nomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties for which
they are broadly used in the management of several chronic
respiratory diseases.11,12 A randomized clinical trial showed
that azithromycin prophylaxis improved bronchiolitis oblit-
erans syndrome–free survival among patients who had
undergone a lung transplant with a significant reduction in
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome prevalence after 2 years.13
The ALLOZITHRO study investigated whether prophylactic
azithromycin would improve airflow decline–free survival 2
years after HSCT.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical
Practice guidelines and the provisions of the Declaration of
Helsinki.14 The Institutional Ethics Committee Ile-de-France
study IV approved the research protocol (Supplement 1).
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants
before randomization. The ALLOZITHRO trial was a multi-
center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
phase 3 superiority trial. Participants were recruited from 19
French bone marrow transplant sites from February 2014 to
August 2015. An independent data and safety monitoring
board periodically reviewed blinded data to assess safety.
A steering committee blindly reviewed diagnoses of nonin-
fectious lung complications.
In September 2016, 13 months after completing recruit-
ment, the independent data and safety monitoring board
detected an unexpected imbalance across blinded groups in
the number of hematological relapses reported as severe
adverse events and alerted the trial steering committee and
the study sponsor. Analysis of these data led to early termi-
nation of the trial in December 2016 for safety concerns.
Then, as requested by national authorities, the protocol was
amended to include follow-up assessments for up to 5 years
after randomization to evaluate the occurrence of late-onset
hematological relapses. We present herein the results as
of April 26, 2017, at which time 91 patients included after
April 2015 had not had the opportunity to complete 2
years of treatment (48 in the azithromycin group; 43 in the
placebo group), including 24 who had already experienced
airflow decline (15 in the azithromycin group; 9 in the pla-
cebo group).
Participants
Eligible participants were at least 16 years old, had undergone
an allogeneic HSCT for a hematological malignancy, and had
available pretransplant pulmonary function test results
according to standard practice. Exclusion criteria were an
allergy or intolerance to azithromycin, macrolides, ketolides,
or the excipient used; an indication for the use of macrolides
as a prophylaxis to prevent infection, according to a 2014
protocol amendment (Supplement 1); a prolonged corrected
QT (QTc) interval (>450 milliseconds); the use of medications
prolonging the QTc interval; a family history of a prolonged
QTc interval; the use of ergotamine or dihydroergotamine;
the use of colchicine; a history of congestive heart failure;
severe liver insufficiency; and history of nontuberculous
mycobacterial infection.
Randomization and Intervention
Participants scheduled to undergo an allogeneic HSCT were
randomly assigned (the day the pretransplant conditioning
regimen was started), in a 1:1 allocation ratio, to receive
azithromycin (a generic drug) at a dose of 250 mg orally
or an identical-appearing placebo 3 times a week for 2 years.
An interactive web-response system was used to randomize
patients. The randomization was stratified by center on
potential confounders—FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio
(≤0.85 or >0.85) and age (≤50 or >50 years)—with prespeci-
fied lists based on permutation blocks of fixed size that
remained blinded to investigators.
Key Points
Question Does azithromycin given at the time of the conditioning
regimen improve airflow decline–free survival after an allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplant?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 465
patients, 2-year airflow decline–free survival was significantly
worse for the azithromycin group than for the placebo group
(hazard ratio, 1.3). The trial was terminated early for a significant
increased risk in the azithromycin group of hematological relapses,
which was a nonprespecified adverse event.
Meaning Azithromycin resulted in worse airflow decline–free
survival, but findings are limited by early termination, and the
potential for harm requires further evaluation.

 Outcomes
The primary composite end point of the study was initially
airflow obstruction–free survival at 2 years after randomiza-
tion, that is, time to airflow obstruction or to death from any
cause. Airflow obstruction was defined as a rate of a pre-
dicted FEV1 decline of more than 5% per year (airflow
decline) and an FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.8, which were
associated with both significant overall and attributable
mortality.15 In 2015, the protocol was amended due to new
data deemphasizing the importance of the FEV1/FVC ratio in
these patients,5,16,17 and only airflow decline and death were
retained as events in the primary composite end point. Sec-
ondary end points were overall survival, bronchiolitis oblit-
erans syndrome and other late-onset pulmonary noninfec-
tious complications, change in pulmonary function
parameters (FEV1, FVC, total lung capacity, residual volume,
and forced midexpiratory flow of 25%-75%), acute and
extrathoracic chronic GVHD, quality of life, and tolerance of
azithromycin, all assessed at 2 years. Late-onset pulmonary
noninfectious complications, including bronchiolitis oblit-
erans syndrome, were determined according to the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria,2 and interstitial lung dis-
ease criteria were determined as previously defined.18 Diag-
nostic criteria and severity of acute and extrathoracic
chronic GVHD were assessed according to the NIH criteria,
with a grading scale from 1 to 4 for acute GVHD and a lim-
ited to extensive grading scale for chronic GVHD.2,19 The
St George’
s Respiratory Questionnaire was used to evaluate
quality of life.20 According to the recommendation of the
data and safety monitoring board and the sponsor, in Octo-
ber 2016, the protocol was amended to include hematologi-
cal relapse up to 2 years after randomization as a post hoc
end point.
Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
The trial was designed as a superiority trial. The sample
size computation was initially based on airflow obstruction–
free survival, which required 460 patients (see the trial
protocol in Supplement 1). After amending the protocol
in 2015, the primary outcome was changed to airflow
decline–free survival. Overall, 218 events and 460 patients
(230 in each group) were needed to demonstrate a clinically
relevant 15% improvement in the primary outcome at 2
years for patients treated with azithromycin compared with
an expected rate of 45% for patients receiving placebo
based on previous data on airflow decline15 and mortality
data from the French Biomedicine Agency (https://www
.agence-biomedecine.fr), with a type I error of .05 and a power
of 0.9 based on a 2-sided log-rank test. To account for an
estimated 5% dropout rate due to consent withdrawals, 480
patients had to be recruited.
Efficacy analysis of data at 2 years was based on a
modified intention-to-treat analysis, excluding only pa-
tients who withdrew their consent according to French
regulation. All analyses used April 26, 2017, as the time of
data cutoff, and patients with less than 2 years of follow-up
were administratively censored at this time. Airflow decline–
free survival and overall survival after randomization were
displayed using Kaplan-Meier plots, compared using log-
rank tests. Cumulative incidences of each event were
described separately. The Cox proportional-hazards model
was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) as a measure of
effect size, with associated 2-sided 95% CIs.21 Adjusted
HRs were secondarily computed, including stratification
variables as the variables known a priori to be associated
with the primary outcome, and variables selected as associ-
ated with the outcome based on univariable prognostic
analyses. Center effect was tested using a frailty term.
Cumulative incidences of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome
as well as acute and chronic GVHD were estimated in a
competing-risk setting, for which death free of the event of
interest was a competing event, and were compared across
randomized groups with the Gray test.22 To summarize pul-
monary function data, a k-means approach specifically
designed to analyze longitudinal data was used23 (eAppen-
dix in Supplement 2).
In a post hoc analysis, the cumulative incidence of hema-
tological relapse was estimated as described for GVHD.
A cause-specific Cox proportional-hazards model with
adjustment for imbalanced prognostic factors was second-
arily used; those variables were selected as prognostic
based on previous available data.24,25 Post hoc exploratory
treatment-by-covariate interaction tests based on Gail and
Simon statistics26 were performed in relation to well-known
prognostic covariates to better understand the effects of
treatment on the cause-specific hazards of hematological
relapse, and chronic GVHD.
Because the trial was stopped early, a tipping-point analy-
sis was also performed to assess the likelihood that the pri-
mary outcome could have become null or better had the study
been completed (eAppendix in Supplement 2).
Safety data, including serious adverse events, were sum-
marized based on randomized groups.
In the regression models, missing values of the dis-
ease risk index were imputed using the modal class.
A 2-sided P value of <.05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant. For the secondary end point analyses, there was
no adjustment for multiple comparisons. Accordingly,
these findings should be considered exploratory. The
statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.3.2
(https://www.R-project.org/).
Results
In September 2016, the independent data and safety moni-
toring board detected an unexpected imbalance across
blinded groups in the number of hematological relapses
reported as severe adverse events. The data and safety moni-
toring board requested that the sponsor globally unblind the
study and requested additional data. An intensive monitoring
of all relapse data was performed, and other imbalanced risk
factors for hematological relapses were investigated. Based
on these analyses, on December 26, 2016, both the data and
safety monitoring board and the sponsor decided to termi-
nate the trial early.

 Study Participants
From February 2014 through August 2015, 480 patients were
randomized in 19 centers; 15 patients withdrew their consent
and were subsequently excluded from the analysis (Figure 1).
The baseline characteristics of the remaining 465 patients are
shown in Table 1. More high-risk patients, more patients with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and more patients older than
50 years with an FEV1/FVC ratio greater than 0.85 were ran-
domized into the azithromycin group. Treatment of the last
randomized patient was initially expected to be completed in
August 2017; treatment was actually stopped for all patients
in December 2016.
Efficacy Analysis
At the time of data cutoff for analysis (April 26, 2017) in the
modified intention-to-treat population, 242 patients (52%)
had experienced a primary event: 104 patients (22%) had
experienced an airflow decline (54 in the azithromycin
group and 50 in the placebo group), and 138 patients (30%)
died (78 in the azithromycin group and 60 in the placebo
group) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). The airflow decline–free
survival was significantly lower in the azithromycin group
than in the placebo group, with a 2-year estimate of 32.8%
(95% CI, 25.9%-41.7%) in the azithromycin group vs 41.3%
(95% CI, 34.1%-50.1%) in the placebo group (P = .03 by the
log-rank test) (Figure 2A). The unadjusted HR for airflow
decline–free survival was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.02-1.70). In a sec-
ondary multivariable analysis adjusted by randomization
strata, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a high disease risk
index, and a random effect of center (though not signifi-
cant), the HR for airflow decline–free survival was 1.2 (95%
CI, 0.9-1.6) (Table 2). A total of 22 patients (5%) experienced
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, 15 (6.4%) in the azithro-
mycin group and 7 (3.0%) in the placebo group (P = .08)
(Figure 2B). At year 2, no significant differences in variation
of FEV1 (eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 2) nor in the
change in the other pulmonary function parameters were
noted between groups (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2).
The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD did not signifi-
cantly differ across randomized groups, with a 2-year esti-
mateof41.9%(95%CI,35.7%-48.1%)intheazithromycingroup
vs 41.2% (95% CI, 35.0%-47.4%) in the placebo group (P = .98)
(Table2,Figure3A).ThecumulativeincidenceofchronicGVHD
wasnotsignificantlydifferentbetweentherandomizedgroups
with a 2-year estimate of 29.0% (95% CI, 23.1%-34.9%) in the
azithromycingroupvs34.0%(95%CI,27.8%-40.2%)inthepla-
cebo group (P = .30) (Table 2, Figure 3B).
A total of 161 patients (35%) died (95 in the azithromycin
group vs 66 in the placebo group), with a 2-year survival rate
of 56.6% (95% CI, 50.2%-63.7%) in the azithromycin group vs
70.1% (95% CI, 64.2%-76.5%) in the placebo group (unad-
justed HR, 1.5, 95% CI, 1.1-2.0, P = .02) (Figure 4A), including
75 deaths after hematological relapse (52 in the azithromycin
group vs 23 in the placebo group) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 2).
Adjusting for factors associated with death (eTable 1 in
Supplement 2) did not significantly modify the results, with
an adjusted HR for death in the azithromycin group of 1.3 (95%
CI, 1.0-1.8) (Table 2).
Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse events that occurred during the study period
are summarized in the eTable 2 in Supplement 2. Cardiovas-
cular events, 5.6% in the azithromycin group vs 3.0% in the
placebo group, were not significantly different (P = .25).
Post Hoc Analyses
In a post hoc analysis, relapse of the underlying hematologi-
cal disease occurred in 77 patients (32.9%) in the azithromy-
cin group and 48 patients (20.8%) in the placebo group
(Table 2), with a 2-year cumulative incidence of 33.5% (95%
CI, 27.3%-39.7%) in the azithromycin group and 22.3% (95%
CI, 16.4%-28.2%) in the placebo group (cause-specific HR, 1.7;
95% CI, 1.2-2.4; P = .002) (Figure 4B). Adjustment for factors
associated with relapse (eTable 3 in Supplement 2) did not sig-
nificantly modify the estimated HR at 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1-2.3).
Additional post hoc analyses of the incidence of acute
GVHD grade 2 or higher and of moderate or severe chronic
GVHD, as well as post hoc subgroup analyses of GVHD and of
hematological relapse are presented in Table 2, the eAppen-
dix, eTable 4 and eFigures 5 through 8 in Supplement 2.
A tipping-point analysis suggested that the effect of
azithromycin on the primary end point could not be reversed
to demonstrate benefit of azithromycin (eTable 5 in
Supplement 2).

 Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial involving patients undergo-
ing allogeneic HSCT for hematological malignancy, early ad-
ministration of azithromycin compared with placebo re-
sulted in worse airflow decline–free survival, although these
findings were limited by the early trial termination. Azithro-
mycin administration also was associated with decreased sur-
vival at 2 years and in post hoc analysis was associated with
hematological relapse at 2 years. These adverse outcomes re-
quire further investigation.

 With the increasing number of transplants, chronic
GVHD has emerged as a significant complication of allogeneic
HSCT.27 Among the target organs of chronic GVHD, lung
involvement with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome has been
associated with increased morbidity and mortality.1,3 Thus,
prophylactic and therapeutic interventions aimed at decreas-
ing the incidence and severity of bronchiolitis obliterans syn-
drome are clearly needed.
Azithromycin, a macrolide derivative, has been widely
used for years both for its antibacterial and immunomodula-
tory properties.11 Azithromycin has been associated with
improved pulmonary function results following lung trans-
plant in randomized, placebo-controlled trials.13,28,29 Follow-
ing allogeneic HSCT, azithromycin has also been shown to
decrease GVHD and mortality30 and to prevent noninfectious
pneumonia31 in murine models of allogeneic HSCT, and the

 association of fluticasone, azithromycin, and montelukast
has been generally used in the United States to treat bronchi-
olitis obliterans syndrome in humans32,33 following results
from a phase 2 open-label trial.10
These factors were considered in designing this random-
ized, placebo-controlled trial which demonstrated that air-
flow decline–free survival was significantly decreased in the
azithromycin group compared with the placebo group. Ad-
justing for imbalanced prognostic factors yielded a nonsig-
nificant estimated adjusted HR of 1.2 (95% CI, 0.9-1.6) for the
primary outcome. The number of patients with bronchiolitis
obliterans syndrome in the azithromycin group was not sig-
nificantly different from that of the placebo group. No signifi-
cant differences in the trajectories of FEV1 and the other pul-
monary function tests were found between the 2 groups.
Overall, the results of this study suggest it is unlikely that
azithromycin could reduce the risk of bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome after allogeneic HSCT. Moreover, survival was de-
creased in the azithromycin group.
This trial had to be stopped prematurely due to an unan-
ticipated increase in the hematological relapse rate in the
azithromycin group. Although other factors may have con-
tributed to hematological relapse, adjusting for factors asso-
ciated with relapse in univariable analysis did not signifi-
cantly modify the effect on hematological relapse observed in
the azithromycin group.
The mechanism for increased hematological relapse in the
azithromycin group is unclear. The graft-vs-leukemia effect af-
ter allogeneic HSCT is a complex phenomenon that is intrin-
sically associated with GVHD.34 A link between the increased
relapseriskintheazithromycingroupanddifferencesinGVHD
incidence was considered, but no differences in GVHD inci-
dence (either acute or chronic) between the 2 study groups was
noted. Azithromycin has pleiotropic but poorly character-
ized effects on the immune system35-38 that might partly ex-
plain the increased hematological relapse rate observed in this
trial, particularly in the early posttransplant period. It is also
possible that azithromycin interfered with the conditioning
regimen, although the current understanding of the antileu-
kemicpowerofallogeneicHSCTisthoughttobemediatedmore
by the immune-mediated graft-vs-leukemia effect than by the
cytotoxicroleofthepretransplantconditioningregimen.39An-
otherpotentialexplanationmaybethatazithromycin,asamac-
rolide derivative, might disturb the microbiome and influ-
ence the risk of subsequent hematological relapse since
commensal bacterial species have recently been associated
with both GVHD and graft-vs-leukemia in the transplant set-
ting or in response to checkpoint inhibitors.40-43
Basedonthehypothesisthatthefirsteventleadingtobron-
chiolitis obliterans syndrome would be the epithelial aggres-
sion induced by conditioning,1,44 azithromycin was started at
the time of conditioning in this study. However, the effect of
azithromycin may be different if administered after engraft-
ment. Although less than other macrolides, azithromycin may
interact with the many other drugs that are administered in
allogeneicHSCTrecipients,includingchemotherapy,andthus,
the effective concentration of azithromycin may have varied
during the study.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the trial was stopped
prematurely, which may have affected the primary outcome
findings because it resulted in a decreased statistical power.
Nevertheless, the observed number of events was higher than
expected, likely due to the increased death rate in the azithro-
mycin group. Tipping-point analysis conducted to assess the
potential effect of premature stopping of the study suggested
that the primary end point findings could not be reversed to
demonstrate a beneficial effect of azithromycin. Moreover, the
administrative censoring of patients with less than 2 years of
follow-up argue against any bias in the analyses of the pri-
mary end point.
Second, this trial used airflow-decline criteria as a com-
ponent of the primary end point. Although well recognized
in predicting the occurrence of bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome,7,8airflowdeclinehasnotbeenvalidatedforusepre-
viously. Nevertheless, no evidence of any effect on pulmo-
nary function tests was observed.
Third, the use of a composite end point, including death
as another primary event, assumed that azithromycin could
act on mortality from other causes. This relied on the re-
ported effect of FEV1 decline on mortality15 as well as on the
reported benefit in animal models of azithromycin prophy-
laxis on mortality.30,31
Fourth, we had to exclude patients who withdrew their
consent, and this may have introduced some selection bias,
although this only concerned 3% of the enrolled patients (3.7%
in the azithromycin group vs 2.5% in the placebo group).
Fifth, given the stratification of randomization, selection
bias due to violation of the allocation concealment by the in-
vestigators is possible; the use of a website by which the strata
were automatically computed and the absence of preference
of investigators toward the use of azithromycin in these highly
complex patients argue against it.
Sixth, the absence of adjustment for multiple compari-
sons of secondary end points requires these findings to be
considered exploratory. Moreover, all results of the second-
ary and post hoc analyses (including subgroup analyses) were
exploratory in nature and should be viewed as hypothesis
generating.
Seventh, a nonnegligible number of patients discontin-
ued their treatment before 2 years, and a per-protocol analy-
sis will be considered in the near future to evaluate the effect
of treatment among those who were treated as outlined in
the protocol.
Conclusions
Among patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT for hematol-
ogical malignancy, early administration of azithromycin
resulted in worse airflow decline–free survival than did
placebo; these findings are limited by the early trial termina-
tion. The potential for harm related to relapse requires fur-
ther investigation.
