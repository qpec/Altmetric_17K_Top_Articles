ABSTRACT
Background Individual studies on the relations
between ambient air pollution and the risk of stillbirth
have provided contradictory results. We conducted a
systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the
existing evidence.
Methods We conducted a systematic search of three
databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, from
their time of inception to mid-April, 2015. Original
studies of any epidemiological design were included.
Data from eligible studies were extracted by two
investigators. To calculate the summary effect estimates
(EE), the random effects model was used with their
corresponding 95% CI.
Results 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. Although
not reaching statistical significance, all the summary
effect estimates for the risk of stillbirth were
systematically elevated in relation to mean prenatal
exposure to NO2 per 10 ppb (EE=1.066, 95% CI 0.965
to 1.178, n=3), CO per 0.4 ppm (EE=1.025, 95% CI
0.985 to 1.066, n=3), SO2 per 3 ppb (EE=1.022, 95%
CI 0.984 to 1.062, n=3,), PM2.5 per 4 μg/m3
(EE=1.021, 95% CI 0.996 to 1.046, n=2) and PM10 per
10 μg/m3 (EE=1.014, 95% CI 0.948 to 1.085, n=2).
The effect estimates for SO2, CO, PM10 and O3 were
highest for the third trimester exposure. Two time series
studies used a lag term of not more than 6 days
preceding stillbirth, and both found increased effect
estimates for some pollutants.
Conclusions The body of evidence suggests that
exposure to ambient air pollution increases the risk of
stillbirth. Further studies are needed to strengthen the
evidence.
INTRODUCTION
Ambient air pollution is a major environmental
health problem in developed and in developing
countries,1 and is a major cause of several import-
ant diseases including lung cancer,2 acute lower
respiratory
infections,3
cardiovascular
diseases,4
pregnancy outcomes,5 chronic obstructive pulmon-
ary
disease
COPD6
and
asthma.7
The
WHO
reports that in 20128 around 7 million people died
—one in eight of total global deaths was as a result
of air pollution exposure, 3.7 million of these were
attributed to ambient air pollution due to exposure
to particulate matter (PM10).1 This estimate is more
than twofold of the previous estimates and suggests
that air pollution is now the world’s largest single
environmental health risk.1
Fetal growth and pregnancy outcome are deter-
mined
by
several
factors
including
maternal
nutrition, environmental exposures and heredity.
The prenatal stage of life is a very sensitive period
such that exposure to harmful substances can have
an adverse effect on the developing fetus. The
effects of air pollution on fetal growth and preg-
nancy outcomes have been studied especially in
developed countries and the results have been sum-
marised in several reviews.9–12
The WHO reported that 2.6 million stillbirths
occurred worldwide in 2009, according to the first
comprehensive set of estimates published in a
special series of Lancet, 2011. Every day, more
than 7200 babies are stillborn.13 Previous studies
have identified the important causes of stillbirth as
umbilical cord accidents, congenital anomalies, pla-
cental abruption, maternal disease (diabetes, HIV
,
syphilis and hypertension), obesity, primiparity and
smoking in pregnancy.14
T
wo
previous
reviews
have
suggested
that
ambient air pollutant exposure including nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), black carbon,
carbon monoxide (CO), polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons (PAH’s) and particulate matter (PM), can
also be an important cause of stillbirth, but both
concluded that the evidence was weak at the time
of conduct. There are also recent reviews indicating
that air pollution from secondhand smoke15 and
solid fuels16 increases the risk of stillbirth.
The two previous reviews of the effects of
ambient air pollution evaluated three studies each,
two of which were common to both reviews, with
What this paper adds
▸ Previous reviews on the relations between
prenatal exposure to air pollution and the risk
of stillbirth were based on only three studies
and were inconclusive. Emergence of a
substantial number of studies since the last
review, called for re-evaluation of the existing
evidence.
▸ This systematic review and meta-analysis
suggests an elevated risk of stillbirth in relation
to air pollution, although further studies are
needed to strengthen the evidence.
▸ Policies such as control of vehicular emissions,
fuel quality improvement and control of
industrial waste emission, should be developed
and implemented to reduce the risk of air
pollutants.

 Glinianaia et al17 stating that the evidence available is insuffi-
cient to assess a possible association between PM and stillbirth.
Lacasana et al18 reported a positive but not consistent associ-
ation between ambient air pollution and stillbirth; this may be
due to an insufficient number of studies available. A recent
review by Zhu et al19 evaluated the effect of exposure to PM2.5
on pregnancy outcomes but only included one study on still-
birth. A substantial number of studies have emerged since the
conduct of these reviews, and this certainly calls for an evalu-
ation of the evidence to provide insight into causality and iden-
tify gaps in knowledge. The objective of the present study was
to assess the effect of prenatal ambient air pollution exposure
on
the
risk
of
stillbirth
through
systematic
review
and
meta-analysis.
METHODS
A systematic search of three databases—PubMed, Scopus and
W
eb of Science—was carried out from their time of inception to
mid-April, 2015, using Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms
without any language restriction. The search terms used are
listed in table 1.
T
wo investigators (NS and HAB) independently searched for
relevant studies from the databases by first screening the titles of
the citations and subsequently reviewing the abstracts of relevant
titles. Studies selected after the abstract review were retrieved in
full and reviewed with articles selected for inclusion in the study
satisfying the following criteria: (1) original articles of any epi-
demiological design; (2) conducted in a human population; (3)
provided effect estimates for the relation between exposure to
any outdoor air pollutant and the risk of stillbirth, or reported
the occurrence of stillbirth among exposed and unexposed
mothers. The reference lists of the included studies were also
reviewed to identify additional eligible studies.
Data extraction and study quality appraisal
A data extraction form adapted from our previous review16 was
used independently by two investigators (NS and HAB) to
extract the relevant information from the studies meeting the
inclusion criteria. The information extracted by the two investi-
gators was compared with any differences resolved by repeat-
edly checking the original articles and through discussion with
the third investigator (AKA) adjudicating in situations where
there
were
disagreements.
Methodological
quality
of
the
included studies was assessed by investigating evidence of selec-
tion, information and confounding bias, and evaluation of the
case ascertainment protocols. The general quality of the studies
was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).20
Statistical analysis
Owing to differences in study design, geographical settings and
different study population, we anticipated the inconsistency in
the studies and applied the random effect model in summary
effect
estimates
with
their
corresponding
95%
CI.
Heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I2 statistic,
with a value >50% being deemed to indicate high heterogen-
eity, 25–50% indicating moderate and <25% indicating low
heterogeneity. Individual studies included in the meta-analysis
had their effect estimates with different magnitude of air pollu-
tant exposure (except for NO2 and PM10), therefore, before
estimating the summary effects the individual effect estimates
were converted with a common pollutant concentration such as
per 3 ppb increase in SO2, per 0.4 ppm in CO, 4 mg/m3 in
PM2.5 and 10 ppb increase in O3 exposure. With regard to the
study providing only trimester specific effect estimates, we first
combined the three (1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester) estimates using
the fixed effects model to get the estimate for the entire preg-
nancy, and then applied the combined estimate in the overall
meta-analysis. Forest plots corresponding to each summary
effect estimate were visually assessed. Sensitivity analysis was
not conducted due to the small number of studies included in
the meta-analysis. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspec-
tion of the funnel plots and application of Begg’s and Egger’s
tests. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata V
.13.0
(StataCorp LP
, College Station, T
exas, USA) software.
RESULTS
A total of 13 studies were included in the review. The study
selection process is shown in figure 1.
Characteristics of included studies
The characteristics of the included studies are presented in
online supplementary table S1.
Of the 13 studies, two studies21 22 assessed the effects of
short-term air pollution exposure with the remaining studies
focusing on long-term air pollution exposure. Six studies23–28
assessed maternal exposure to air pollution on a trimester basis.
Of the 11 epidemiological studies with assessment of long-
term air pollution exposure, six studies23
25–29 employed a
cohort design, of which one26 was prospective. T
wo studies30 31
were semiecological, that is, the exposure was assessed at group
level and the outcome at individual level, and another two
studies were cross-sectional32 33 with one study24 applying a
case control design. Of the two epidemiological studies with
assessment of short-term air pollution exposure, one21 applied a
case-crossover design with the hazard period defined as lag day
2 and reference periods selected by matching on the weekday
within the same calendar month, and they also used two
through 6 days before delivery as lag days. The other short-term
air pollution exposure study22 was a time series analysis using
Poisson regression and with lag effect of up to 5 days preceding
delivery. Regarding the geographical location of the included
studies, five studies were conducted in the USA, one in Latin
America, three in East Asia, two in Europe, one in Russia and
one in the UK. Seven of the included studies were published
after the year 2005.
Eleven21–31 of the included studies relied on routine air moni-
toring data in their respective study areas in estimating maternal

 air pollution exposure. Landgren33 categorised each exposure in
two ways, (1) above and below the mean exposure value (SO2:
8.0 mg/g, CH: 6.6 mg/g and NO: 14.7 mg/g) of all the included
municipalities and (2) the municipality with the highest expos-
ure level was compared with all other municipalities. Vassilev
et al32 used statewide combined modelled average concentra-
tions for each census tract and categorised exposures into low
(0.040–0.268 mg/m3), medium (0.269–0.610 mg/m3) and high
exposure (0.611–2.830 mg/m3) level with low exposure serving
as the reference in the analysis. The included studies measured
13 pollutants including SO2, NO2, CO, particles (PM2.5, PM10,
SPM), O3, NO, POM, NOx, hydrocarbon (CH), black smoke,
which was taken as equivalent to PM4 in the study that mea-
sured this pollutant,25 and suspended solids.
Of the 11 studies relying on air monitoring station data,
seven studies21 23–28 and that by Vassilev et al32 assigned expo-
sures to mothers based on their residential addresses at the time
of delivery. Regarding the studies conducted by Faiz et al21 23
and DeFranco et al,27 mothers had to live within a 10 km radius
of the closest monitoring station; and Green et al28 used 20 km
radius for PM2.5, O3, SO2 and 5 km radius for CO and NO2 to
be included in the studies. Whereas Hwang et al24 applied a
25 km radius. The exposure assignments in the studies by Kim
et al,26 Pearce et al25 and Vassilev et al32 were not based on any
fixed radius. The two ecological studies30 31 used annual mean
concentrations of the pollutants studied to assign exposures.
Dimitriev29 used monthly concentration of air pollutants in the
study areas.
Six studies21 23 24 27 28 32 used a stillbirth cut-off point of
>20 weeks of gestation, with three studies22
25
30 using a
cut-off of >28 weeks of gestation. Landgren33 and Sakai31 did
not provide a case definition in their reports. DeFranco et al27
ascertained stillbirth by using both, last menstrual period (LMP)
and
ultrasound
examination
methods,
whereas two
other
studies25 26 mostly used the LMP method but also used fetal
ultrasound examination if there was either uncertainty about the
LMP date or discordance between the two estimates. T
wo
studies23 28 used the LMP method only, with Hwang et al24
applying ultrasound examination. The type of stillbirth studied
was not mentioned in any of the included studies except the
study by Pereira et al,22 which identified the stillbirths as intra-
uterine mortality, which we assume to be antepartum stillbirth.
The source of data on stillbirth was obtained from fetal death
certificates in five studies,21–23 32 33 birth registry or vital statis-
tics in five studies24 27 28 30 31 and hospital records in two
studies.25 26 Dimitriev29 did not provide any information on
how the stillbirths were ascertained.
Methodological quality of the included studies
Selection bias
Selection bias was very minimal in the included studies as most
of the studies collected data from fetal death certificates or birth

 registries and are likely to have represented their source popula-
tions with high response rate also reported. The prospective
cohort study,26 however, only included pregnant women who
visited the hospital for prenatal care, excluding mothers with
missing values for residential address and sociodemographic risk
factors. Few studies25 28 32 excluded mothers without gesta-
tional age information and census tract coding (8%) from the
analysis.
Information bias
There was evidence of potential information bias in all the
included studies due to the reliance on proximity of maternal
homes to the nearest air pollution monitoring station,21–31 and
use of emission measurement and meteorological data32 33 in
assessing exposure. Factors such as mother’s mobility, change of
residence during pregnancy, occupation of mother and air
exchange were not considered, and this may lead to a decrease
in the accuracy of the exposure assessment and introduce a non-
differential misclassification that might lead to an underestima-
tion of the effects of air pollution. Also, the exposure source
was not reported by the studies other than those by Hwang
et al,24 Pearce et al,25 Vassilev et al32 and Sakai.31 For the
outcome measurement, the true dates of fetal death were
unknown, hence an estimated time using date of delivery was
recorded on the fetal death certificate and this may introduce
bias. This was observed in the study by Faiz et al,21 23 Hwang
et al,24 Kim et al,26 Green et al,28 Bobak and Leon,30 and
Vassilev et al.32
Control of confounding
Any determinant of the risk of stillbirth could be considered as
a potential confounder in cohort, case–control and cross-
sectional studies. The case-crossover study and time-series
analyses
eliminate
any
confounding
related
to
individual
characteristics and environmental exposures that are linked to
the
studied
air
pollutant.
Most
studies
adjusted
for
the
characteristics of the mother, such as age and family character-
istics, at an individual level. Some of the studies applied control
of confounding at group levels.30 When estimating the effect of
an individual air pollutant, exposure to other air pollutants is a
potential confounder. Only five studies fitted more than one air
pollutant into the multivariate model, that is, applied multipol-
lutant rather than single pollutant models.21 22 24 28 30
Regarding the ecological studies, Bobak and Leon30 adjusted
for several socioeconomic characteristics, which were obtained
from the Czech Statistical office, at the district level; whereas
Sakai31 did not control for confounding. In the time series ana-
lysis, Pereira et al22 adjusted for season and weather. Faiz et al21
conducted a case-crossover study where they controlled for
mean temperature of the corresponding lag days. Of the nine
long-term air pollution exposure studies, Dimitriev29 did not
control for any confounding and the confounding control
was considered inadequate in one study,33 as the author
only adjusted for year of birth, maternal age and parity.
Confounding control was considered adequate in the remaining
studies.23–28 32 These studies adjusted for a range of confoun-
ders including maternal age, race, education, socioeconomic
status, season or month of conception, parity, infant sex,
prenatal care and lifestyle characteristics. Hwang et al24 and
Kim et al26 further controlled for gestational age and maternal
anthropometry,
respectively.
Vassilev et
al32
used
separate
Mantel-Haenzel OR analysis for potential confounding factors
and few factors were controlled in the final logistic regression
model, this approach can also be deemed as adequate control of
confounding factors.
By applying the NOS scale, three studies23 24 28 were rated as
very high quality (case–control/cohort—8 or more stars) and one
study26 was rated as high quality (cohort study—7 stars). The
Newcastle-Ottawa-Scores for all the studies included in the
meta-analyses are presented in the online supplementary table S2.
Findings of included studies and summary effect estimates
Summary effect estimates are presented in table 2 and the corre-
sponding forest plot in figure 2.
Three studies23 24 28 provided estimates for the relation of
SO2 exposure (per 3 ppb, 1 ppb and 10 ppb increase in mean
concentration) to stillbirth for the entire pregnancy period. The
summary-effect estimate (EE) per 3 ppb increase in SO2 expos-
ure in the random effects model was 1.022 (95% CI 0.984 to
1.062), with low heterogeneity between the studies observed
(I2=19.6%). The case-crossover study21 reported increased risk
of stillbirth with IQR (4.7 ppb) increase in mean SO2 exposure
2 days before delivery, and also found similar associations on all
the lag days; whereas, another time series study22 reported mar-
ginal association between daily counts of intrauterine mortality
and SO2 concentration on the same day as delivery. One of the
ecological studies31 also found significant positive correlation
between spontaneous fetal death rate and SO2 concentration.
However, Landgren33 and other ecological study (per 50 mg/m3
increase in annual mean concentration of SO2),30 however, did
not find any association, even after adjustment with other pollu-
tants SPM and NOx.
Three studies23 24 28 provided estimates for the relation of
both NO2 and CO exposure for the entire pregnancy period,
with the summary EE in the random effects model found to be
1.066 (95% CI 0.965 to 1.178) per 10 ppb increase in mean
NO2 concentration and 1.025 (95% CI 0.985 to 1.066) per
0.4 ppm increase in mean CO concentration, respectively.
Evidence of high heterogeneity was observed in the NO2 ana-
lysis
(I2=79.6%).
The
case-crossover21
studies
reported
increased risk of stillbirth with IQR increase of NO2 (16.4 ppb)
and CO (0.54 ppm) in mean concentration, respectively, 2 days
before delivery and also found similar associations on all the lag
days.
The
time-series
study22
reported
strong
significant
dose–response relationship between daily counts of intrauterine
mortality with NO2 concentration, and marginal association
with CO concentration at 5 days and 3 days before delivery,
respectively. The findings of CO exposure with stillbirth were,
however, less consistent. Sakai31 also found a statistically signifi-
cant positive correlation between NO2 concentration and spon-
taneous fetal death rate. Pereira et al22 also developed an overall
index of air pollution (combination of NO2, SO2, CO) and
found a very robust significant association with dose–response
relationship, whereas Faiz et al21 used two pollutant models on
lag day 2 but found estimates similar to those of the single pol-
lutant models. Green et al28 adjusted PM2.5 or ozone with NO2
and the associations were unaffected.
T
wo studies24 26 provided estimates for the relation of still-
birth per 10 mg/m3increase in average PM10 concentration
during the entire pregnancy duration to the summary EE in the
random effects model found to be 1.014 (95% CI 0.948 to
1.085). Evidence of high heterogeneity was noted in the analysis
(I2=85.0%). The time series study22 did not find any statistically
significant associations.
T
wo studies23 28 provided estimates for the relation of still-
birth per 4 mg/m3 increase in average PM2.5 concentration
during the entire pregnancy duration to the summary EE in the

 random effects model found to be 1.021 (95% CI 0.996 to
1.046). No heterogeneity was noted in the analysis (I2=0.0%).
DeFranco et al27 found non-significant 21% (OR: 1.21, 95% CI
0.96 to 1.53) increased risk in stillbirth with high PM2.5
(15.67 mg/m3) exposure during the entire pregnancy.
T
wo studies24 28 provided estimates for the relation of still-
birth per 10 ppb increase in average O3 concentration during
the entire pregnancy duration to the summary EE in the
random effects model found to be 1.002 (95% CI 0.971 to
1.034). Evidence of low heterogeneity was noted in the analysis
(I2=19.6%). The time series study22 evaluated the relation
between O3 exposure and stillbirth, and found no association.
Four studies23 24 26 28 provided trimester-specific estimates
for the relation of stillbirth risk to six pollutants (SO2, NO2,
CO, PM10, PM2.5, O3). With the exception of SO2 exposure
during the second trimester, NO2 and PM2.5 exposure during
the third trimester and O3 exposure during the first trimester,
we observed evidence of moderate to substantial heterogeneity
in most of the analysis. In the random effect model, almost all
these pollutants (per 3 ppb SO2, 10 ppb NO2, 0.4 ppm CO,
10 mg/m3 PM10, 4 mg/m3 PM2.5 and 10 ppb O3 increase in
mean concentration) showed increased risk in each trimester
except SO2 and NO2 exposure in the second trimester, PM10
and O3 exposure in the first and second trimester and PM2.5
exposure in the third trimester. For SO2, CO, PM10 and O3,
third trimester exposure appears to pose the highest risk
whereas for NO2 and PM2.5, first trimester exposure posed the
highest risk. The summary EE per 10 mg/m3 increase in PM10
exposure showed an increasing trend whereas for PM2.5 per
4 mg/m3 increase in concentration, a decreasing trend was
observed. Regarding SO2, NO2, CO and O3, the trend was
inconsistent with the second trimester summary estimates, being
the lowest for SO2, NO2, O3 and first trimester for the
CO exposure. Faiz et al21 found a non-significant small
increased risk of stillbirth with IQR increase in the mean PM2.5
concentration in their time series analysis on all the lag days.
Whereas DeFranco et al27 found significant 42% (OR 1.42,
95% CI 1.06 to 1.91) increased risk in stillbirth with high
PM2.5 (16.22 mg/m3) exposure only in the third trimester.
Hwang et al24 evaluated increased risk of stillbirth in association
with SO2 per 1 ppb and PM10 per 10 mg/m3 increase during the
first and second months of pregnancy, and was stable after
adjustment for O3 and either CO or NO2 in multipollutant
models. Green et al28 found robust association with third tri-
mester O3 exposure after addition of PM2.5 and NO2.
Dimitriev29 compared the occurrence of stillbirth in good and
worse ecological areas assessed on the basis of monthly concen-
tration of selected pollutants (suspended solids, SO2, CO, NO2),
and reported risk of stillbirth as 6.63 and 11.03 per 1000
births, respectively. The estimated risk ratio showed a 65% (RR
1.650, 95% CI 1.136 to 2.397) increased risk of stillbirth
among mothers resident in polluted ecological areas.
T
wo studies31 33 that investigated the relation of NO exposure
to stillbirth also found no association. The association between
stillbirth risk and per 10 mg/m3 relating average weekly black
smoke (equivalent to PM4) exposure was evaluated by Pearce
et al,25 but did not find any significant association during preg-
nancy. Bobak and Leon30 evaluated the effects of SPM and NOx
(per 50 mg/m3 increase in concentration), and found no signifi-
cant
association

 adjustment with all pollutant (SPM, SO2, NOx) models. Vassilev
et al32 investigated POM exposure and, using low exposure as
the reference category, found statistically significant increased
risk of stillbirth with medium and high exposure (ORs of 1.21
(95% CI 1.04 to 1.40) and 1.19 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.39), respect-
ively). The effect of CH was investigated by Landgren,33 but no
association was found between stillbirth and levels of CH con-
centration in Swedish municipalities.
Evaluation of publication bias
Figure 3 presents the funnel plots for all the study specific effect
estimates used to calculate the summary effect estimates. Online
supplementary table S3 presents results from the Begg’s and
Egger’s tests. There was no indication of publication bias
present, although these results should be interpreted with
caution because they were based on two or three study-specific
effect estimates only.
DISCUSSION
Our systematic review and meta-analysis provided evidence that
prenatal exposure to air pollution increases the risk of stillbirth.
The summary effect estimates from the random effects models
were systematically elevated, although they did not reach statis-
tical significance. Per 10 ppb NO2, 0.4 ppm CO, 3 ppb SO2,
4 mg/m3 PM2.5 and 10 mg/m3 PM10, increase in mean exposure
during the entire pregnancy duration, respectively, resulted in a
6.6% (EE=1.066, 95% CI 0.965 to 1.178), 2.5% (EE=1.025,
95% CI 0.985 to 1.066), 2.2% (EE=1.022, 95% CI 0.984 to
1.062), 2.1% (EE=1.021, 95% CI 0.996 to 1.046) and 1.4%
(EE=1.014, 95% CI 0.948 to 1.085) increased risk of stillbirth.
The point estimates for the third trimester were slightly elevated
for SO2, CO, PM10 and O3 consistently, with a hypothesis of a
susceptible time window for the adverse effects, although the
differences were not statistically significant. T
wo time series
studies used lag day not more than 6 days preceding stillbirth
and both found increased risk with certain pollutants.
Validity of results
W
e included all the studies identified in an extensive systematic
search, so missing of important epidemiological studies is less
likely to have happened. A significant number of studies have
emerged since the last reviews; hence the critical assessment of
the evidence is timely. Even though our review contains eight
more studies and much more information than the previous
reviews, we found a very limited number of estimates for each
of the pollutants, and only five studies made attempts to adjust
for other air pollutants when presenting effect estimates of each
air pollutant. Therefore, we could not include all of the studies
in the meta-analyses, and the reliability on the summary effect
estimates is further compromised. However, the existing evi-
dence is suggestive of causality for air pollution and stillbirth
without precise identification of the timing of exposure. With
the limited studies on the relevant topic, our review suggests
strong priorities for future research. The visual inspection of the
funnel plots and the statistical assessment did not indicate publi-
cation bias.

 immaturity.34 The biological mechanisms by which exposure to
ambient air pollutants leads to fetal death is not very clear. Faiz
et al21 suggested the direct crossing of air pollutants across the
placenta, causing irreversible damage to the dividing cells of the
growing fetus and triggering hypoxic damage or immune-
mediated injury during critical periods of development, as a
possible mechanism.
Of all the pollutants, only the mechanism of the toxic effects
of CO on the fetus is well established.17 CO reduces oxygen-
carrying capacity of maternal haemoglobin that could seriously
affect oxygen delivery to fetal circulation.35 Sangalli et al36
revealed that CO crosses the placental barrier and haemoglobin
on fetal blood has greater affinity for binding CO than that in
an adult; O2 delivery to fetal tissues is further compromised.37
Moreover, fetal elimination of carbon monoxide is slower than
in the mother.38 There is also a significant dose-dependent rela-
tionship between CO and COHb, and a developing fetus can be
deprived of adequate oxygenation due to high levels of COHb,
which may even lead to fetal death.22
Maternal exposures to particulate (PM) air pollutants during
pregnancy
can
result
in
increased concentration
of DNA
adducts or may lower the efficiency of the transplacental func-
tion, resulting in decreased fetal health leading to stillbirth.39 40
There is evidence that the presence of air pollution increases
blood viscosity and plasma fibrinogen relates to coagulation;
these haematological factors might have an influence on blood
perfusion of the placenta, which could also lead to impair fetal
health.41–43
Synthesis with previous knowledge
In the meta-analysis, we observed a 1.4% (EE 1.014, 95% CI
0.948 to 1.085) increased risk of stillbirth with 10 mg/m3
increase in PM10 exposure during the entire duration of preg-
nancy, albeit statistically but not significantly. Pereira et al22 also
did not find any statistically significant association in their time
series study. Glinianaia et al17 reported little evidence of associ-
ation between exposure to PM and stillbirth risk, and thus
describes it as insufficient to assess a possible association
between PM and stillbirth.
For PM2.5, Zhu et al indicated that there was no evidence of
statistically significant effect (OR: 1.18, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.04)
on stillbirth with an increase of 10 mg/m3; this result is consist-
ent with our review, which reveals (EE 1.021, 95% CI 0.996 to
1.046)
with
an
increase
of
4 mg/m3.
However,
in
our
meta-analysis, we also found a 4.2% (EE 1.042, 95% CI 0.920
to 1.180) and 4.0% (EE 1.040, 95% CI 0.940 to 1.152)
increase
per
4 mg/m3,
in
the
first
and
second
trimester,
respectively.
W
e also observed a small and statistically non-significant
increased risk of stillbirth with SO2 2.2% (EE 1.022, 95% CI
0.984 to 1.062) and CO 2.5% (EE 1.025, 95% CI 0.985 to
1.066)
exposure
for
the
entire
pregnancy
period
in
the
meta-analysis. The short-term air pollution studies on these rela-
tionships21 and one of the ecological studies31 also reported an
increased risk of stillbirth related to SO2 and CO exposure. The
findings of CO exposure with stillbirth was, however, less
consistent.
Lacasana et al18 stated that SO2 and CO also showed some,
though less consistent, relationship with intrauterine mortality.
In our review, we found that there is an increased risk of still-
birth associated with increased ambient concentrations of sulfur
dioxide in early pregnancy, with pooled effect estimates of 4.0%
(EE 1.040, 95% CI 0.962 to 1.125). Also, we found the highest
pooled estimate of 5.2% (EE 1.052, 95% CI 0.973 to 1.138)
for carbon monoxide in the last trimester.
For NO2, we observed a higher increase risk of stillbirth of
6.6% (EE 1.066, 95% CI 0.965 to 1.178) for the entire preg-
nancy. This finding is consistent with the study by Lacasana
et al,18 which reported an increased risk of stillbirth with expos-
ure to NO2.
Most of the pollutants in polluted ambient air, such as PM
and CO, are also present in indoor air polluted by smoking and
solid fuel combustion, although the concentrations are lower.
Leonardi-Bee et al15 conducted a meta-analysis of studies on the
effects of secondhand smoking on the risk of stillbirth, present-
ing a 23% risk increase (EE 1.23, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.38).
Amegah et al16 synthesised the effect of solid fuels showing an
effect estimate of 29% for stillbirth. These findings are consist-
ent with the present pollutant-specific summary effect estimates
and thus strengthen the hypothesis that ambient air pollution
increases the risk of stillbirth.
Conclusion, recommendations and implications for future
research
Our results provide suggestive evidence that ambient air pollu-
tion is a risk factor for stillbirth. Pregnant women should be
aware of the potential adverse effects of ambient air pollution,
although the prevention against exposure to air pollutants gen-
erally requires more action by the government than by the indi-
vidual. The healthcare sector can create awareness and engage
other sectors contributing to ambient air pollution (such as the
housing sector, transportation sector, industries and the energy
sector), to develop and implement policies such as control of
vehicular emissions, fuel quality improvement and control of
industrial waste emission, to reduce the risk of air pollutants.
Most of the studies reviewed used data from monitoring sta-
tions to assess maternal exposure levels. Future studies should
integrate the use of personal monitoring methods and also con-
sider the activity of mothers, change in residence, air exchange,
mother’s occupation and outdoor activities of the mothers. The
pregnant women should also be monitored if possible from the
first month of pregnancy in order to ascertain the exact period
of the effect.
