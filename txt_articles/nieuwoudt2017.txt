ABSTRACT 
24 
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by reductions in β-cell function and insulin secretion on the 
25 
background of elevated insulin resistance. Aerobic exercise has been shown to improve β-cell function, 
26 
despite a subset of T2D patients displaying “exercise resistance”. Further investigations into the 
27 
effectiveness of alternate forms of exercise on β-cell function in the T2D patient population are needed. 
28 
We examined the effect of a novel 6-week CrossFit™ Functional High Intensity Training (F-HIT) 
29 
intervention on β-cell function in 12 sedentary adults with clinically diagnosed T2D (54±2 years, 166±16 
30 
mg/dL fasting glucose). Supervised training was completed 3 days a week, comprising of functional 
31 
movements performed at a high intensity in a variety of 10-20 minute sessions. All subjects completed 
32 
an oral glucose tolerance test and anthropometric measures at baseline and following the intervention. 
33 
The mean Disposition Index (DI), a validated measure of β-cell function, was significantly increased (PRE: 
34 
8.4±3.1, POST: 11.5±3.5, P=0.02) after the intervention. Insulin processing inefficiency in the β-cell, 
35 
expressed as the fasting proinsulin-to-insulin ratio, was also reduced (PRE: 2.40±0.37, POST: 1.78±0.30, 
36 
P=0.04). Increased β-cell function during the early-phase response to glucose correlated significantly 
37 
with reductions in abdominal body fat (R2=0.56, P=0.005) and fasting plasma alkaline phosphatase 
38 
(R2=0.55, P=0.006). Mean total body fat percentage decreased significantly (Δ: -1.17 0.30%, P=0.003), 
39 
while lean body mass was preserved (Δ: +0.05±0.68kg, P=0.94). We conclude that F-HIT is an effective 
40 
exercise strategy for improving β-cell function in adults with T2D.

INTRODUCTION 
43 
Insulin is an essential glucoregulatory hormone. In the presence of insulin resistance, this pancreatic β-
44 
cell secreted hormone has a diminished ability to drive plasma glucose into peripheral tissues. The 
45 
subsequent glycemic dysregulation is overcome by β-cell compensation via insulin hyper-secretion. In a 
46 
subset of individuals, however, the β-cell is unable to sustain this compensatory state and eventually 
47 
undergoes failure. This progression underlies the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is the topic 
48 
of several in-depth reviews (8, 12, 15). Investigating therapies that target recovery of  β-cell function in 
49 
the T2D patient population is of paramount clinical importance, as 21 million American adults have 
50 
already been diagnosed with the disease (7). 
51 
 
52 
Several groups have demonstrated that exercise has a profound effect on insulin secretion and β-cell 
53 
function (16, 29), in addition to its already established influence on insulin sensitivity (17, 28). The 
54 
specific effects of exercise on β-cell function appear to be dependent on metabolic status and the mode 
55 
of exercise implemented. We have shown that a twelve-week aerobic exercise intervention improved β-
56 
cell function in adults with T2D (31). The same intervention also suppressed insulin hyper-secretion in 
57 
healthy overweight adults. We further demonstrated that exercise-driven improvements in glycemic 
58 
control were better predicted by insulin secretion rather than sensitivity (32). Specifically, participants 
59 
with greater pre-intervention pancreatic secretory function also had the greatest improvements in 
60 
glycemic control. When comparing responses to physical training in T2D patients with moderate versus 
61 
low secretory capacity, Dela et al. reached a similar conclusion, showing that only the moderate 
62 
secretors responded favorably to exercise training (9). From these findings there appears to be a 
63 
response dichotomy to exercise in the T2D population, specifically dependent on residual β-cell 
64 
secretory capacity. 
65 
 
66

The aforementioned studies employed only aerobic exercise training. A recently published study of 8-
67 
weeks of High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which has risen in popularity in both the exercise science 
68 
field and society at large, in adults with T2D showed improvements in β-cell function, despite no 
69 
changes in insulin secretion or sensitivity (21). The combination of aerobic and resistance training in the 
70 
STRRIDE-AT/RT randomized trial resulted in increased β-cell function to a greater extent than either 
71 
training mode alone, in sedentary, obese, non-diabetic adults (1). Combination training or high intensity 
72 
training may be able to overcome the apparent resistance to exercise seen in some individuals in 
73 
aerobic training only studies, but this has yet to be investigated. 
74 
 
75 
The exercise approach that was developed by CrossFit, Inc.™, differs significantly from the exercise 
76 
protocols used in studies to date, and may be described as a Functional High Intensity Training (F-HIT) 
77 
protocol. This type of supervised training is defined by constantly varied, functional movements 
78 
performed at a high intensity, and combines resistance training, gymnastics (body weight), and aerobic 
79 
exercise.  Importantly, workouts only require 10 to 20 minutes per session and are only performed 3 
80 
times per week (30). To date, there are no published studies that have assessed β-cell function in F-HIT 
81 
or resistance training within the T2D patient population. We hypothesized that this novel F-HIT 
82 
intervention program would increase β-cell function in adults with T2D.  
83 
 
84 
METHODS 
85 
Subjects. This pilot, proof-of-principle study, involved twelve adults with clinically diagnosed T2D (8 
86 
women, 4 men, HbA1c 8.6±0.7%, 53 ± 2 years), recruited from the Cleveland Metropolitan Area. All 
87 
participants were receiving standard of care treatment including metformin and diet/exercise 
88 
education, but none were taking insulin to control their diabetes. Exclusion criteria included heart, 
89 
kidney, liver, thyroid, intestinal, and pulmonary diseases or medications known to affect the outcome 
90 
  
5
variables of the study. All participants underwent medical history, physical exam, and clinical blood-work 
91 
prior to entering the study. Participants were sedentary (less than 1 hour of exercise a week) and weight 
92 
stable (±5 lbs.) for the prior 6 months. Study design and procedures were approved by the Cleveland 
93 
Clinic Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided written informed consent. 
94 
 
95 
Intervention. Exercise comprised of 6-weeks of F-HIT (CrossFit™) training, performed at an established 
96 
gym (Great Lakes CrossFit, Bedford Heights, Ohio, USA) under the instruction of a certified CrossFit™ 
97 
trainer. Groups of 2-4 participants performed three exercise training sessions per week, which included 
98 
one high-intensity workout (> 85% HR maximum) ranging in duration from 10-20 minutes. Over the 
99 
course of 6 weeks, participants were exposed to an array of functional weightlifting, gymnastics, and 
100 
endurance movements in various combinations. More information about the individual movements and 
101 
exercises may be found at https://www.crossfit.com/exercisedemos/. Post-testing commenced within 
102 
36 hours after the final exercise bout. 
103 
 
104 
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). Participants were provided a standardized mixed meal dinner (55% 
105 
carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15% protein) the night before testing. The meal made up 33% of their daily 
106 
energy requirements based upon the Harris-Benedict Equation (13). Medications were withheld 24 
107 
hours prior to testing, and the participants also refrained from structured exercise during that time. 
108 
Following an overnight (~12 hours) fast, a baseline blood sample (5 mL) was drawn from an antecubital 
109 
vein. A 75 gram glucose beverage was then consumed within 5 minutes. Additional blood samples were 
110 
drawn at 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes after the glucose was consumed. Aprotinin, EDTA, and DPP-IV 
111 
inhibitors were included in sub-aliquots of plasma and serum according to manufacturer 
112 
recommendations. 
113 
 
114

Blood Analysis. The following clinical blood measures were determined on an automated platform 
115 
(Roche Modular Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN): alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase 
116 
(AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), plasma glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, 
117 
LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. Free fatty acids (FFA) were measured on serum samples collected 
118 
at 0 and 120 minutes of the OGTT using a non-esterified fatty acid enzymatic colorimetric quantification 
119 
assay (Wako Diagnostics, Richmond, Virginia, USA). FFA suppression was calculated as the percent 
120 
reduction in serum FFA from the 0 to 120-minute time points (14). Insulin and C-peptide were measured 
121 
for all OGTT samples via radioimmunoassay (EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA) and counted 
122 
on a Beckman Gamma 4000 Counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA). Intact proinsulin was 
123 
measured by ELISA (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden), with <0.03% and <0.006% specificity for insulin and C-
124 
peptide, respectively. Plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic 
125 
peptide (GIP) were measured on baseline, 30, and 60 minute samples using an enzyme-linked 
126 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). Insulin processing was 
127 
calculated as the ratio of proinsulin to insulin (6).  The early-phase C-peptide secretory response 
128 
(Secretory Index), an established predictor of early-phase insulin secretion, was calculated as the ratio of 
129 
the change in plasma C-peptide and glucose concentrations between baseline (0 minute) and 30 minute 
130 
samples during the OGTT (26). Late-phase insulin secretion was calculated as the ratio of the total area 
131 
under the curve (tAUC) for plasma C-peptide and glucose measures from 30 to 180 minutes of the OGTT. 
132 
An Insulin Sensitivity Index (ISI) was calculated using the validated Stumvoll equation (37). β-cell 
133 
function (Disposition Index, or DI) was individually calculated as the product of the Secretory Index and 
134 
ISI multiplied by 103 (2). Unless stated otherwise, secretion and β-cell function here refer to the early-
135 
phase Secretion Index and Disposition Index, respectively. 
136 
 
137

Body Composition. Body composition measures were obtained prior to and after completion of the 
138 
intervention. Body weight was determined using standard procedures to the nearest 0.1 kg averaged 
139 
over three independent measures. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to determine total 
140 
and depot specific body fat, as well as lean mass, with the Lunar iDXA model scanner and software (GE 
141 
Healthcare, Madison, Wisconsin). 
142 
 
143 
Physical Performance. All participants underwent a screening 12-lead electrocardiogram submaximal 
144 
exercise stress test (SensorMedics, CareFusion, San Diego, CA) to assess healthy heart function and 
145 
safety to exercise. The test was performed on a treadmill at constant speed while the grade was 
146 
increased in two minute stages until the individual reached 80-85% of their age-predicted heart rate 
147 
max. Blood pressure was also recorded during every 2-minute stage of the test. A second incremental 
148 
graded treadmill exercise test was administered on a separate day and was performed before and after 
149 
the exercise intervention to measure maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max; Jaeger Oxycon Pro, Viasys, 
150 
Yorba Linda, CA) (17). The test was deemed maximal if there is a plateau of VO2 despite increased work 
151 
load and at least two of the following additional criteria were satisfied: volitional fatigue, heart-rate 
152 
greater than age-predicted maximum, and RER of ≥1.10. Blood pressure and heart rate were also 
153 
monitored during the test. Performance during each exercise training session was recorded by the 
154 
CrossFit™ trainer. Days 2 and 18 (final session) consisted of the same sets of exercises with total 
155 
repetitions recorded: 5 sets of 1 minute of rowing, 1 minute of sit-ups, 1 minute of squats (no weight), 
156 
and 1 minute of rest. One subject did not complete a post-intervention VO2max test due to equipment 
157 
failure, and another subject did not have the number of repetitions recorded for their final exercise 
158 
training session.

Statistics. Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean. Statistical analyses were 
161 
performed using GraphPad Prism 5. Data sets were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. 
162 
Non-normal data were natural log transformed to approach normality, which was subsequently 
163 
confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. PRE- to POST-intervention statistical comparisons were analyzed 
164 
with a paired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Linear regression analyses between study variables (Δ vs. Δ) 
165 
were also performed in GraphPad Prism 5, using the Pearson test for correlations. Non-normally 
166 
distribute Δ data sets were also natural log transformed to approach normality. The accepted P value for 
167 
significance for each two-tailed test and Pearson correlation was set a priori at less than 0.05. 
168 
 
169 
RESULTS 
170 
Physiological and Metabolic Adaptations. F-HIT intervention effects on subject anthropometrics and 
171 
fasting plasma measures are listed in Table 1. Body composition changed significantly, with a mean 
172 
reduction in total body fat percentage (Δ: -1.1 ± 0.3 %, P = 0.002) along with trending total body weight 
173 
loss (Δ: -1.8 ± 1.0 kg, P = 0.09). Exercise capacity was significantly greater after training, with increases in 
174 
both VO2max (Δ: 0.38 ± 0.08 L/min, P = 0.001) and total repetitions completed for standardized training 
175 
sessions (Δ: 59 ± 8, P < 0.001). Mean fasting plasma measures of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, 
176 
and free fatty acids, which are of general clinical importance to patients with T2D, did not change 
177 
significantly. Measures of liver enzyme levels in the plasma (ALP, AST, ALT) were significantly, or tended, 
178 
to be reduced. First-phase (0-30min) and late-phase (30-180min) plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and 
179 
proinsulin remained unchanged as well (Table 1). 
180 
 
181 
Insulin Secretion. The early-phase DI was significantly improved following the intervention (PRE: 8.4 ± 
182 
3.1, POST: 11.5 ± 3.5, P = 0.02; Fig. 1A). Late-phase DI was not increased (PRE: 15.6 ± 3.1, POST: 16.4 ± 
183 
2.5, P = 0.65). There was, however, variability in individual responses to the intervention with regard to 
184 
  
9
DI (Fig. 1C). Individuals with ΔDI above the mean are indicated as filled circles, with those below the 
185 
mean with little to no change in DI indicated as crossed circles. Since DI is the product of early-phase 
186 
secretion and insulin sensitivity, the individual Δ’s for these measures are presented in Figure 1D and 1E. 
187 
The individual demarcations from Figure 1C are retained in 1D and 1E, to further illustrate the variability 
188 
in responses to the intervention. These latter data show that improvements in insulin secretion, and not 
189 
insulin sensitivity, were most likely responsible for the improvement in DI. The proinsulin/insulin ratio, a 
190 
measure of insulin processing inefficiency, was reduced after the intervention (PRE: 2.40 ± 0.37, POST: 
191 
1.78 ± 0.30, P=0.04; Fig. 1B). 
192 
 
193 
Incretin and FFA Responses. Fasting GLP-1 (PRE: 3.32 ± 0.65, POST: 3.46 ± 0.72 ng/mL, P = 0.78) and GIP 
194 
(PRE: 40.5 ± 7.0, POST: 46.9 ± 7.0 ng/mL, P = 0.14) levels remained unchanged, as well as tAUC for the 
195 
first 60 minutes of the OGTT: GLP-1 (PRE: 558 ± 98, POST: 477 ± 88 ng/mL*min, P = 0.58), GIP (PRE: 
196 
10903 ± 1502, POST: 11645 ± 1257 ng/mL*min, P = 0.38). The intervention did not significantly alter 
197 
fasting FFA levels (Table 1) or FFA suppression (PRE: -78.4 ± 3.8, POST: -78.5 ± 5.3 %, P = 0.98). 
198 
 
199 
Correlations. Based on correlation analyses, changes in body composition and ALP correlated 
200 
significantly with β-cell function and secretion. These data are presented in Figure 2, with linear 
201 
regressions and 95% confidence intervals plotted for each Δ vs. Δ correlation. The individual 
202 
demarcations from Figure 1 for individual responses in early-phase β-cell function are kept in Figure 2. 
203 
This representation further emphasizes the significant correlations between changes in β-cell function 
204 
and insulin secretion, and decreases in abdominal body fat, and lowered fasting serum ALP levels. 
205 
Individual changes in the fasting proinsulin/insulin ratio, another measure of β-cell function, did not 
206 
significantly correlate with any study variables. 
207 
 
208 
  
10
Sub-group Analysis. Figure 2C shows the spread of individual responses to the F-HIT intervention based 
209 
on the DI derived β-cell function index. Sub-group analyses were performed to compare the individuals 
210 
demarcated in Figure 1 as filled circles (“responders”, n=5) versus crossed circles (“non-responders”, 
211 
n=7). Participants in the “responder” sub-group were all female, with no significant differences from the 
212 
“non-responders” in terms of age or body composition. This “responder” sub-group had higher PRE-
213 
intervention fasting plasma ALP levels (92 ± 5 vs. 64 ± 7 U/L, P = 0.008), as well as higher fasting C-
214 
peptide levels (4.0 ± 0.3 vs. 2.7 ± 0.5 ng/dL, P = 0.05). This sub-group also had better overall glucose 
215 
tolerance, as tAUC (0-180 min) glucose was lower for this sub-group PRE- (33603 ± 2228 vs. 44157 ± 
216 
4060 mg/dL*min, P=0.05) and POST-intervention (32242 ± 2051 vs. 43290 ± 3502 mg/dL*min, P=0.02). 
217 
Secretory capacity, expressed as C-peptide tAUC (0-180 min), was also greater in the “responder” sub-
218 
group PRE- (792.4 ± 54.0 vs. 550.8 ± 73.9 ng/mL*min, P=0.03) and POST-intervention (787.0 ± 44.5 vs 
219 
569.0 ± 75.0 ng/mL*min, P=0.03). Early-phase secretion changes were significantly greater in the 
220 
“responder” sub-group (0.20 ± 0.06 vs. -0.02 ± 0.01 ng/mL/mM, P = 0.02), which is apparent from the 
221 
distribution of individual changes in secretion presented in Figure 1D. Congruent with the correlations 
222 
shown in Figure 2, fasting plasma ALP levels (-18.4 ± 3.3 vs. 0.9 ± 2.6 U/L, P = 0.002) and abdominal fat (-
223 
2.6 ± 0.85 vs. 0.40 ± 0.65 %, P = 0.02) were significantly reduced in the “responder” sub-group. Following 
224 
the intervention, the “responder” sub-group also had lower fasting plasma glucose (126 ± 11 vs. 187 ± 
225 
22 mg/dL, P=0.04). 
226 
 
227 
DISCUSSION 
228 
Determining β-cell function in humans poses specific challenges, as only indirect plasma metabolite 
229 
measures are generally possible. The OGTT has emerged as an efficient and effective method for 
230 
assessing pancreatic insulin secretion (36). However, insulin secretion is tied directly to insulin 
231 
sensitivity, in a classic hyperbolic relationship (4). The Disposition Index or DI, which is the mathematical 
232 
  
11
product of secretion and sensitivity, has thus been clinically accepted and validated as a measure of β-
233 
cell function in humans (33). Here we show that exercise at high intensity for as little as 10-20 mins/day, 
234 
3 days/wk for 6-weeks improves β-cell function in adults with T2D (Fig. 1A). The fasting 
235 
proinsulin/insulin ratio, representing the processing inefficiency of insulin within the β-cell, was also 
236 
significantly reduced following the intervention (Fig. 1B), providing further evidence for improved β-cell 
237 
function. 
238 
 
239 
Despite achieving mean improvements in β-cell function, overall glucose tolerance was not significantly 
240 
changed. Following a more traditional 3-month aerobic exercise intervention in T2D patients, Dela et al. 
241 
used a sub-group analysis to show that only participants with residual β-cell secretory capacity (defined 
242 
as “moderate secretors”) had significantly improved β-cell function, despite no changes in glucose 
243 
tolerance (9). We also found variability in individual changes in DI, where some participants had limited 
244 
changes and even reductions in DI in response to the intervention. Therefore, we used a similar sub-
245 
group analysis approach to delineate possible factors that might contribute to these differences. This 
246 
analysis revealed that the “responder” sub-group did indeed show improved glucose tolerance, lower 
247 
glucose tAUC and fasting glucose POST-intervention, following the intervention in contrast to the “non-
248 
responder” sub-group. These data highlight that participants who did not appreciably improve their β-
249 
cell function also do not experience improvements in glucose tolerance. 
250 
 
251 
Resistance to the beneficial effects of exercise could be due to under-performance or compensatory 
252 
lifestyle changes, as some research groups have suggested (20, 24, 35). This variability in response to 
253 
lifestyle intervention has been noted before (5). In this study two measures of physical performance 
254 
improved very significantly in response to the intervention (Table 1), but neither β-cell function nor 
255 
secretion significantly correlated with either of these measures. Within the sub-group analysis, there 
256 
  
12
were also no differences between “training volume”, or the total number of repetitions in comparative 
257 
sessions, between either of the two sub-groups. As a result we cannot attribute response variability 
258 
specifically to differences in training effort. Instead, as our previously published (32) and currently 
259 
presented data suggest, residual β-cell secretory capacity is required for exercise (independent of mode) 
260 
to effectively improve β-cell function and glycemic control. Longer exercise interventions, combined 
261 
with strict dietary guidelines, may be able to drive improvements in β-cell function in patients with more 
262 
severe T2D who display resistance to the exercise modes studied to date (25). However, if non-response 
263 
is driven by genetic factors, as Stephens et al. (34) and Lessard et al. (20) suggest, modifying lifestyle 
264 
only, may not be a sufficient therapeutic approach.  
265 
 
266 
The intervention was quite effective at reducing total body fat, with trending reductions in body weight. 
267 
Notably, lean mass was preserved (Δ: 0.05 ± 0.68 kg, P = 0.94) indicating that any changes in body 
268 
weight were due to reductions in fat mass. We also found that reductions in abdominal fat correlated 
269 
significantly with changes in both β-cell function (R2 = 0.56, P = 0.005) and secretion (R2 = 0.41, P = 0.02) 
270 
(Fig. 2). Accumulation of adipose tissue in the abdominal region has been linked to increased insulin 
271 
resistance (18), and correlates closely with increased β-cell dysfunction (40), highlighting the negative 
272 
role of fat in this region on metabolic function. Potential mechanisms include increased plasma FFAs 
273 
driving lipotoxicitiy of the β-cell (3). However, we did not see any significant statistical association 
274 
between change in FFAs and β-cell function. We recognize that fasting levels of FFAs do not adequately 
275 
represent the dynamic regulation of lipolysis (38). However, the percent suppression of plasma FFAs 
276 
from minute 0 to minute 120 of the OGTT also remained unchanged after the intervention. We have 
277 
previously reported that exercise and diet intervention-induced improvements in β-cell function among 
278 
adults with T2D were significantly correlated with changes in GIP (31). However, the incretin hormone 
279 
  
13
levels of GLP-1 and GIP remained unchanged in this study, suggesting that some other mechanism is 
280 
driving improved β-cell function after this type of intervention. 
281 
 
282 
Many patients with T2D also have accompanying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 
283 
hepatocyte apoptosis, which we (10) and others (27) have shown can be reduced by exercise (aerobic 
284 
and resistance training). Mean plasma AST and ALT levels, which are clinical measures of liver 
285 
hepatocyte apoptosis, were significantly reduced following the intervention (Table 1), suggesting overall 
286 
improvements in liver function (11). Fasting ALP also tended to decrease. The correlations in Figure 2 
287 
and our sub-group analyses reveal that in the “responder” sub-group, ALP levels were significantly 
288 
elevated PRE-intervention, but markedly reduced POST-intervention. Cross-sectional analysis of plasma 
289 
ALP levels show that there appears to be no link to sex (41), despite the sex differences between the 
290 
two sub-groups. The source of circulating ALP, which may be of liver, bone, or intestinal origin, was not 
291 
specifically identified in the clinical assay performed. As a result, we are unable to conclude whether ALP 
292 
levels were indicative of changes in liver, gut, or bone function. The limited available literature on the 
293 
topic of ALP in T2D is conflicting.  One study determined that bone is the predominant source of 
294 
elevated ALP in T2D (23), although this is not a consistent observation (39). In a mouse model, a high fat 
295 
diet increases serum ALP levels, but ALP was unaffected by exercise training despite protecting the mice 
296 
from liver steatosis and loss of β-cell function (22). Our data are contrary to these animal model findings, 
297 
highlighting the need to further investigate the role of this enzyme in diabetes and exercise, especially 
298 
as it relates to β-cell function. 
299 
 
300 
This was a pilot proof-of-principle study investigating the efficacy of a 6-week F-HIT lifestyle intervention 
301 
in adults with T2D, and hence limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size and lack of 
302 
comparative groups, in the form of a control group or groups participating in alternative forms of 
303 
  
14
exercise. Instead, we designed the study using an internal validity paradigm, where each participant’s 
304 
PRE-intervention served as the control for the POST-intervention testing results. Second, we note that 
305 
from a technical perspective, the use of the hyperglycemic clamp technique would have provided a 
306 
more in-depth determination of pancreatic function. 
307 
 
308 
There is little scientific doubt that exercise is beneficial, yet adults with T2D may find it difficult to 
309 
adhere to a strict exercise regimen, citing “lack of time” as one of their primary barriers (19). F-HIT 
310 
programs like CrossFit™ may address this barrier by providing structure, supervision, and accountability, 
311 
with a minimal time commitment (10-20 min/session 3 times per week). Additionally, no adverse events 
312 
or injuries were reported by participants throughout the course of the study. Therefore, we conclude 
313 
that F-HIT is a safe and effective exercise approach by which adults with T2D may improve their β-cell 
314 
secretory function, given that residual β-cell secretory capacity is preserved. Here we have identified 
315 
that changes in plasma ALP levels and abdominal adiposity appear to be additional delineating factors in 
316 
determining the efficacy of exercise mediated improvements in β-cell function. Larger training studies 
317 
may shed important insight into the variability in responses to exercise observed in the T2D patient 
318 
population and to subsequently develop the most effective exercise treatment options for these 
319 
patients.
