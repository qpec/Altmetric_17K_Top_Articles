Considerable scope exists to vary the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles, with
subsequent impact on biological interactions; however, no accelerated process to access large
nanoparticle material space is currently available, hampering the development of new
nanomedicines. In particular, no clinically available nanotherapies exist for HIV populations
and conventional paediatric HIV medicines are poorly available; one current paediatric
formulation utilizes high ethanol concentrations to solubilize lopinavir, a poorly soluble
antiretroviral. Here we apply accelerated nanomedicine discovery to generate a potential
aqueous paediatric HIV nanotherapy, with clinical translation and regulatory approval for
human evaluation. Our rapid small-scale screening approach yields large libraries of solid
drug nanoparticles (160 individual components) targeting oral dose. Screening uses 1 mg of
drug compound per library member and iterative pharmacological and chemical evaluation
establishes potential candidates for progression through to clinical manufacture. The wide
applicability of our strategy has implications for multiple therapy development programmes.

anomedicine has made significant impact to patients
globally across disparate disease conditions ranging from
schizophrenia
and
hypercholesterinemia
to
macular
degeneration and various cancers; existing therapies include
Doxil/Caelyx
and
Myocet
for
breast
cancer,
paliperidone
palmitate for 3 monthly long-acting schizophrenia treatment,
Visudyne for macular degeneration and Tricor for cholesterol
management1–3. The growing pipeline of candidate nano-
medicines continues to have options at various development
stages, moving towards the ranks of clinically proven medicines.
Nanotherapies often utilize injectable nanocarriers that deliver
drug
cargoes
directly
to
the
bloodstream;
however,
daily
injections are not practical in many clinical scenarios, such as
chronic
conditions
requiring
self-administration
over
a
protracted period. Such conditions render many nanomedicine
approaches inappropriate, especially if disease is not restricted to
targetable organs, creating a prerequisite for oral administration
and requiring consideration of inter-related factors such as
pharmacokinetics, patient adherence and pill burden. Many of
these issues are exacerbated during paediatric administration
where there is much less understanding4.
Daily oral administration of modern antiretroviral (ARV)
therapy has transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a manage-
able chronic condition. However, access to ARVs is not universal
and paediatric treatment formats still require improvement. The
global burden of HIV continues to grow, with 2014 World Health
Organization (WHO) statistics estimating 36.9 million people
living with HIV, 2.6 million of which were children o15 years. At
the end of 2014, an estimated 14.9 million people were receiving
ARVs including only 32% of infected children. The ability to
moderate progression of HIV to AIDS, in addition to B2 million
new annual infections, places increasing demand on ARVs. The
2015 WHO guidelines5 recommend
therapy initiation for
everyone living with HIV at any CD4 cell count in addition to
daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis for at-risk populations,
exacerbating
supply
pressure
and
stimulating
therapy
optimization strategies. Although attrition processing of large
drug particles down to smaller particle sizes, using techniques
such as high-pressure homogenization or nanomilling2,6, has led
to
many
Food
and
Drug
Administration-approved
oral
nanomedicines utilizing solid drug nanoparticles (SDNs), there
are currently no oral ARV nanotherapies available. In addition, it
is not clear what chemical and physical parameters (for example,
size, surface chemistry, charge, charge density and polydispersity)
of SDNs will successfully achieve clinical target performance and
attrition processing is labour and time intensive. While many
nanotechnologies are being explored for HIV, the achievement of
large-scale production, under clinical manufacturing conditions
and at low cost, is often not addressed.
In new cases of paediatric HIV infection (o3 years), a
ritonavir (RTV)-boosted lopinavir (LPV) oral liquid formula-
tion is WHO-recommended as a 4:1 LPV:RTV combination.
Both LPV and RTV have low bioavailability with poor
water
solubility
(1.92
and
1.26 mg l � 1,
respectively)
and
substrate affinity for transporters and metabolic enzymes7.
Despite its well-known side effects, RTV is required as a
pharmacoenhancer to ‘boost’ the pharmacokinetics of other
ARVs that are substrates for p-glycoprotein and/or cytochrome
P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); a second drug, Cobicistat, is also approved
as a booster for HIV therapies. For infants, the WHO-
recommended twice-daily dose is 300 mg/75 mg LPV/RTV
per m2 of body surface area, and a paediatric oral solution
(80/20 mg ml � 1) is available. Due to the poor water solubility of
both drugs, the oral solution contains 42.4% (v/v) ethanol and
15.3% (w/v) propylene glycol. Administration may commence
as early as 14 days after birth for prevention of mother-to-child
transmission in HIV-positive mothers. Clearly, it would be
preferential to avoid regular dosing of alcoholic mixtures, and
viable strategies to remove RTV and/or alcohol are urgently
required. Nanomedicine strategies may have a critical role to
play in the formation of aqueous orally dosed paediatric
therapies, but any strategy must allow rapid formation and
evaluation of multiple SDN options and have cost and
scalability
at
its
core.
We
recently
reported
emulsion-
templated freeze-drying (ETFD)8, a non-attrition approach to
the
production
of
aqueous
re-dispersible
SDNs,
and
its
application to the ARV efavirenz9. The prototype nano-
medicine exhibited higher pharmacokinetic exposure than a
conventional preclinical formulation in rats after oral dosing.
Herein, we describe the extension of this strategy to the
accelerated discovery and translation of LPV and LPV/RTV
combination SDNs with high drug loading relative to excipients
(Z50 wt%)
through
a
unique
iterative
cycle
of
materials
chemistry and pharmacology, utilizing a novel high-throughput
ETFD screening process, with scale of production subsequently
achieved by clinically compliant spray-drying. Reduction to lead
candidates
with optimized
drug
loading, larger
pilot-scale
production and stability testing has enabled formation of a
candidate LPV nanomedicine for imminent human clinical trials
(EudraCT number 2013-004913-41). By generating a formulation
library with variability in size, surface charge and surface
chemistry during screening stages, the identification of optimal
nanoparticle properties as they relate to the pharmacology is
possible. This process is highly translatable and offers the rapid
production, evaluation and optimization of cost-effective orally
dosed drug nanoparticles to address unmet clinical needs across
various diseases.
Results
High-throughput screening of SDN candidates. SDN formation
was initially studied using a miniaturized ETFD approach (Fig. 1);
a 160-component library screening process was developed to
determine candidate polymer and surfactant combinations,
focusing first on single LPV SDNs with 10 wt% drug loading
relative to water-soluble excipients. Oil-in-water emulsions were
prepared from a chloroform (CHCl3)/water mixture with thor-
ough emulsification utilizing externally focused ultrasonication to
avoid cross-contamination. Excipient stabilizers with wide che-
mical and structural diversity were chosen from the Food and
Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
list of inactive ingredients10, ensuring pre-existent use in clinically
approved medicines. Once sonicated, all volatile components
were removed by freeze-drying to leave dry monolithic porous
matrices of water-soluble excipients containing LPV SDNs.
Monolith dispersion by addition of water (1 ml) led to the
release of SDNs with stability derived from adsorption of the
excipient
polymers
and
surfactants.
SDN
hydrodynamic
diameters (Dz; Fig. 2a), polydispersity indices (PDI) and zeta
potentials (z; Fig. 2b) were determined by dynamic light
scattering (DLS). Unlike the serial formation of SDNs by
attrition methods, the large number of SDNs successfully
formed by ETFD required criteria to reduce the options to
those most likely to succeed as scale-able nanomedicines
including: (1) complete aqueous dispersion; (2) Dzo1000 nm;
(3) Dz s.d. between repeated measurement o10% (n ¼ 3;
Fig. 2c,d); and (4) PDIo0.5. Although varying criteria could be
chosen to narrow the options for further study, these were
selected to ensure investigation of monomodal distributions of
stable particles in the sub-micron range, generated after rapid
dispersion; larger multi-micron particles are able to be readily
generated using alternative methods.

 Of the 160-component library, 74 candidates met these
selection criteria and production was subsequently repeated to
assess reproducibility (n ¼ 3) and confirm z values. Good
reproducibility for each SDN candidate, with considerable Dz
and
z
variability
between
library
members
was
achieved
(Supplementary Table 1). SDN formation was enhanced by
non-ionic surfactants with correlation between Dz and surfactant
use; greater Dz variation was observed with changing surfactant
across each polymer option (Fig. 2c). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
and Kollicoat generated the most SDN candidates matching the
selection criteria, presumably due to their surface active proper-
ties.
To
enable
pharmacological
evaluation,
the
74
SDN
candidates were each reproduced with integration of a tracer
amount of 3H-radiolabelled LPV; this approach to the formation
of radiolabelled SDNs is unique to ETFD to the best of the
authors’ knowledge.
Pharmacological evaluation of SDNs comprising 10 wt% LPV.
High-throughput
screening
of
LPV
apical-to-basolateral
permeation (A4B; gut to blood) across Caco-2 cells was utilized
for selection of leads with favourable pharmacology. An aqueous
LPV control showed A4B permeation of 3.5% per hour. From
the 74 LPV SDN candidates, most options showed comparable or
greater A4B permeation (Fig. 2e). SDNs containing PVA with
either Tween 20 or Tween 80 showed 45.5-fold greater trans-
cellular permeation (20.5% per h). Importantly, a number of LPV
SDN formulations also showed reduced permeation; SDNs
comprising Kollicoat and Tween 20 showed a 1.4-fold lower rate
(2.7% per hour). In addition, accumulation and cytotoxicity in
Caco-2 cells was assessed (Supplementary Table 2). Only two
formulations showed cellular accumulation ratios (CAR) higher
than the LPV aqueous solution (CAR ¼ 35.3); sodium carbox-
ymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) and Brij58 (CAR ¼ 36.6), and
NaCMC and hyamine (CAR ¼ 39.6), indicating that augmented
intracellular drug delivery was not driving increased permeation.
No increase in overt cytotoxicity was observed. The considerable
diversity in pharmacological behaviour of the SDN library,
generated from this single compound, strongly underlines the
need for a wide ranging study of the multiple chemical and
physical variables that dominate SDN interactions with biological
systems. Only through library generation and subsequent phar-
macological testing can new SDN nanomedicine options be
substantially de-risked to allow the investment of time and
resources for further development.
Optimizing SDN candidate drug loading and excipient ratios.
Increasing drug content within SDN lead options is critical to
cost-effective production and reduction of exposure to unneces-
sary excipients, particularly surfactants. Having established the
potential for comparable or enhanced permeation through
Caco-2 monolayers, and good reproducibility without compro-
mising cytotoxicity, 49 candidates were chosen for progression.
A series of smaller libraries, restricted to the seven water-
soluble surfactants and seven water-soluble polymers within the
chosen 49 candidates, was generated with progressively increasing
drug loading. ETFD libraries targeting r50 wt% LPV utilized the
same oil-to-water phase ratio (1:4) and polymer:surfactant
wt% ratio (40:10) as initial screens; libraries targeting up to
70 wt% LPV employed a 20:10 polymer:surfactant wt% ratio and
successful SDN dispersions were characterized using DLS.
Compared with the initial screen containing 10 wt% LPV,
libraries
comprising
50 wt%
LPV
(Supplementary
Fig.
1;
Supplementary Table 3) generated considerably fewer successful
SDN options, with further reductions observed at a 70 wt% LPV
loading (Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 4). The
polymers PVA, Kollicoat and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose
(HPMC) successfully generated SDNs at 50 wt% LPV; however,
Kollicoat was unsuccessful at 70 wt%. PVA proved to be the most

freeze-drying, forms re-dispersible solid monoliths comprising water-soluble excipients and poorly water-soluble drug nanoparticles. Detailed physical and

 successful polymer at high drug/excipient ratios, with HPMC also
showing considerable promise. The 49-component screen yielded
six promising candidates at 70 wt% LPV. The inability of various
excipients to generate SDNs at high drug content is possibly due
to a lack of interaction with particles during formation under the
ETFD process or an inability to provide sufficient surface
nanoparticle coverage after dispersion. Each 49-component
ETFD screen at 70 wt% LPV utilized 343 mg of drug, highlighting

 the importance of the initial 10 wt% screening process (160 mg
LPV per 160-component library) to minimize drug use.
The polymer:surfactant ratios within the seven most promising
70 wt% LPV SDN options were varied from a 1:2 to a 5:1 wt ratio
(n ¼ 2)
to
minimize
surfactant
(Supplementary
Fig.
3;
Supplementary
Table
5).
Resultant
SDNs
varied
in
Dz
(566–984 nm) with near-neutral z values ( � 11 to 18 mV). Six
70 wt% LPV SDN formulations (Supplementary Table 6) were
chosen for extended in vitro pharmacological evaluation due to
their high drug loading and low surfactant content (5-10 wt%);
these included binary mixtures of PVA:a-tocopherol polyethylene
glycol succinate (TPGS), PVA:Tween 20 and PVA:sodium
deoxycholate. LPV SDN options containing HPMC were not
progressed at this stage due to the variability that was seen when
using different batches of this excipient; with robustness as a key
commercial need, a detailed investigation of this variability was
not conducted.
Combination 70 wt% LPV/RTV SDN formulations. ETFD is
uniquely
able
to
generate
multiple-component
SDNs
by
combining two or more hydrophobic compounds within the
internal
oil
phase11,12;
other
approaches
to
combination
nanoparticle
approaches
have
utilized
lipid
nanocarrier
approaches for subcutaneous injection13. This is of high
clinical
relevance
for
HIV
due
to
the
need
for
drug
combinations. The ETFD conditions for 70 wt% LPV SDNs
were utilized to generate LPV/RTV dual-component SDNs
through substitution of a fraction of the LPV with RTV to
provide a 56:14 w/w, matching the current 4:1 w/w clinical
products while maintaining relative drug:excipient wt ratios.
Recently, we showed RTV SDNs display augmented inhibition
of CYP3A4, offering the potential for RTV dose reduction14.
Therefore, combination SDNs with 10:1 and 40:1 wt ratios
(LPV/RTV) were also generated. In general, very little variation
in SDN formation and Dz was seen, but z values were observed
to increase when substituting LPV with RTV (Supplementary
Table 7).
Monolith and nanodispersion characterization. The two lead
SDN candidate formulations with good reproducibility, size and
low surfactant content (70 wt% LPV and 56/14 wt% LPV/RTV,
both with 20 wt% PVA and 10 wt% TPGS) were characterized in
the solid state and as aqueous nanodispersions. Long-term sta-
bility is critical to translation and stable dosing dispersions within
the pharmacy would considerably enhance convenience of use.
LPV has at least four known crystal polymorphs and solvates with
the thermodynamically stable form (Form 1) being preferred in
conventional solid dosing15. Powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD) of
the
ETFD
lead
SDNs
showed
fully
amorphous
materials
(Supplementary Fig. 4a) with no observable crystallinity and no
relevant variation in Dz, z or PDI was observed during the 6-
month
study
(Supplementary
Fig.
4b–d).
Aqueous
SDN
dispersions showed good stability for 10 h after dispersion; Dz
increased slightly (600 nm to B750 nm) over 3 h with no further
change over 8 h, and no substantial PDI or z variation
(approximately
� 15 mV;
Supplementary
Fig.
4e-g).
Good
stability across
a wide pH range 2.5–9.5
(Supplementary
Fig. 4h) was seen with the expected z variation indicating
predominantly steric
stabilization. Similar
investigations
of
LPV/RTV
combination
SDN
monoliths
and
aqueous
dispersions showed similar chemical and physical behaviour;
amorphous material in the solid state, stable dispersions under
varying pH and good stability when dispersed in water for 10 h
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
In vitro pharmacology of LPV and LPV/RTV 70 wt% SDNs.
Gut absorption was evaluated using Caco-2 permeation of the
aqueous SDN dispersions at various time points (1, 2, 3 and 4 h).
In these extended studies, B4A and A4B permeation was
compared
with an
aqueous
LPV
solution
(Supplementary
Table 8). At 1 h, the A4B transcellular permeation for each
SDN comprising 70 wt% LPV ranged from 138.1 to 239.9 nmol,
which is B2.5–4.8-fold higher than the measured 50.6 nmol for
the LPV aqueous solution. Concomitantly, transcellular permea-
tion in the B4A direction was similar to an aqueous solution for
all but one SDN candidate at the 1 h time point (Supplementary
Table 8). Over 4 h, one SDN formulation showed consistently
greater A4B permeation compared with the aqueous LPV
solution, with similar B4A permeation, suggesting bioavailability
at least similar to conventional LPV as hoped for a bioequivalent
paediatric format. This nanoformulation consisted of 70 wt%
LPV, 20 wt% PVA and 10 wt% TPGS.
Drug permeation across Caco-2 monolayers from LPV/RTV
combination SDNs was individually assessed. LPV permeation
was greater than aqueous controls containing equivalent LPV/
RTV for all combination SDNs tested across all time points
(Supplementary Table 9): after 1 h, LPV permeation from
combination SDNs was 380.9 nmol for a 4:1 ratio (control ¼ 77.6
nmol), 545.3 nmol from a 10:1 ratio (control ¼ 56.9 nmol) and
356.7 nmol from a 40:1 ratio (control ¼ 44.1 nmol). After 4 h,
LPV permeation from combination SDNs was 922.5 nmol from a
4:1 ratio (control ¼ 176.3 nmol), 872.5 nmol from a 10:1 ratio
(control ¼ 124.6 nmol)
and
854.5 nmol
from
a
40:1
ratio
(control ¼ 79.2 nmol). RTV permeation from combination SDNs
with a 4:1 or 10:1 LPV/RTV ratio was similar to the respective
aqueous controls and greater for combination SDNs with a 40:1
ratio. Based upon the Caco-2 permeation data (Supplementary
Table 8; Fig. 3a,b) for the lead candidates, and focussed on
acceleration towards future translation, progression of only one
single and one combination SDN formulation to pilot-scale
clinical manufacture was conducted. LPV SDNs allow study of
variation in RTV (dosed using conventional 50 mg tablets) levels
and the potential for manipulation of drug ratios to maintain
bioequivalence of LPV, rather than the single study of one fixed
combination SDN; LPV SDNs were therefore selected for
progression to large-scale manufacture.
The use of Caco-2 monolayers for relatively rapid evaluation of
gut permeation has been reported by many groups, but recent
reports of co-culture and triple-culture models that allow the
incorporation of mucous within the in vitro models have sought
to extend the relevance of such studies16. Permeation of the
selected LPV SDNs through two additional co-culture models and
one triple-culture model was studied to determine gross variation
between models.
Permeation of 50 wt% loaded spray-dried lead LPV SDN across
the cellular layer of triple-culture model was assessed to
determine the influence of mucous and M cells on SDN
permeation
(Supplementary
Table
10).
The
presence
of
HT29-MTX-cells in the monolayer resulted in a significant
decrease in SDN permeation at all time points assessed (Po0.05),
presumably due to the inhibiting presence of a more developed
mucous layer covering the apical surface of the cells. Compared
with the data from Caco-2 monolayers, double-culture mono-
layers containing both Caco-2 and M cells did not alter the
cellular permeation of the LPV SDN at 1 h (P ¼ 0.24), 2 h
(P ¼ 0.18), 3 h (P ¼ 0.065) or 4 h (P ¼ 0.093).
Cellular toxicity of aqueous LPV, 50 wt% loaded spray-dried
lead LPV SDN, PVA and TPGS were assessed over 24 h in Caco-2
cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). The aqueous LPV, 50 wt% loaded
spray-dried lead LPV SDN, and PVA were not toxic at any
concentration tested, therefore, had CC50 above 50 mM. The

Translation of ETFD SDNs to pilot-scale clinical manufacture.
ETFD library screening identified SDN options with potential as
orally dosed HIV nanomedicines. The removal of alcohol from
current paediatric treatments and the opportunity to investigate
the impact of RTV boosting of SDNs led to cost-effective large-
scale production studies. Several challenges were identified
including low solid content within ETFD screening (2% w/v).
Spray-drying of emulsions containing volatile organic solvents is
not commonplace, but solutions of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2)
have been previously spray-dried at scale17. We aimed to
optimize
processing
conditions
for
large-scale
LPV
SDN
manufacture
while
translating
to
emulsion
spray-drying
(ESD)
and
maintaining
Dz,
PDI,
z
and
pharmacological
behaviour for the candidate SDNs. Inexpensive laboratory grade
PVA (80% hydrolysed, molecular weight (MW) ¼ 9,500 g mol � 1)
was replaced with pharmaceutical grade PVA (grade 4–88,
MW ¼ 57–77,000 g mol � 1) and the heat stability of LPV was
investigated to determine temperature limits for spray-drying. In
addition, CHCl3 was replaced with CH2Cl2 as the emulsion
internal phase. The International Conference on Harmonisation
Steering Committee categorizes CHCl3 and CH2Cl2 as class 2
solvents. However, the residual solvent limits for CH2Cl2 are
600 p.p.m. (whereas CHCl3 limit ¼ 60 p.p.m.) allowing greater
scope for reaching acceptable limits. The boiling point of CHCl3
(61.2 �C) and low volatility during small-scale sonication makes it
ideal for ETFD, but the lower boiling point of CH2Cl2 (39.6 �C)
presents a greater opportunity for efficient removal during
aerosolisation within the heated carrier gases of a spray-dryer.
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of
LPV solutions in CH2Cl2 showed no degradation over 24 h and
similar analysis of spray-dried emulsion samples (10 ml) showed
99.6% LPV recovery when using inlet temperatures up to 220 �C
(outlet ¼ 114 �C).
SDN
formation
by
ESD
was
conducted
by
processing
the emulsions identified using ETFD (70 wt% LPV/20 wt%
PVA/10 wt% TPGS; 1:9 oil:water phase ratio; 2 wt% total solids)
using a Buchi benchtop spray-dryer. Initial experiments failed to
form SDNs at 70 wt% LPV and stepwise reduction of LPV to
50 wt% yielded SDNs from readily water-dispersible powders
with
very
similar
results
to
those
formed
during
ETFD
(Dz ¼ 625±18 nm, PDI ¼ 0.47±0.03, Dn ¼ 337±49 nm). Opti-
mization of solids content within feedstocks was also conducted
in a stepwise fashion, increasing from 2% w/v to 8 w/v % by
simple removal of water from the emulsion. Feedstock concen-
trations are a critical determinant of achieving cost-effective scale
when spray-drying. Variation in probe sonication parameters
made little impact on emulsion or SDN formation, but spray-dry
conditions were adjusted to increase flow through the spray-
dryer, resulting in an inlet temperature of 140 �C and subsequent
outlet
of
70 �C.
Optimized
emulsions
comprised
CH2Cl2
(2 ml, 200 mg ml � 1 LPV) and an aqueous PVA/TPGS solution
(6.4 ml and 1.6 ml respectively, 50 mg ml � 1) in a 1:4 oil/water
phase ratio with an overall 8 w/v % solid loading (50 wt% drug
loading). Spray-drying yielded readily water-dispersible solid
powders releasing SDNs with Dz ¼ 393±6 nm, PDI ¼ 0.28±0.03,
Dn ¼ 272±12 nm. Substitution of 20 wt% of LPV with RTV, to
make combination LPV/RTV SDNs, successfully generated
powders that dispersed to give SDNs of Dz ¼ 441±16 nm,
PDI ¼ 0.24±0.01, Dn ¼ 290±84 nm.
Emulsion volumes were increased to 300 ml with excellent
reproducibility of LPV SDNs (no RTV) using the benchtop spray-
dryer and subsequent progression to semi-pilot-scale (Niro
Mobile Minor) where a series of 20 emulsions were successively
fed through the spray-dryer over 4 h leading to 306 g of
SDN-containing powder (64% mass recovery). After vacuum
drying under ambient conditions, LPV content was determined
by HPLC as 53 wt% with no measureable impurities. This
material was shown to be amorphous via p-XRD, yielding
dispersed
SDNs
on
dispersion
into
water
(Dz ¼ 404 nm,
PDI ¼ 0.28 and Dn ¼ 256 nm, z ¼ � 1.1±0.09 mV). The stability
of the amorphous SDNs was studied under controlled conditions
over 12 months at elevated temperature (40 �C and 75% relative
humidity) with no indication of crystallinity or degradation over
this period (Supplementary Table 11); in addition, samples stored
under ambient conditions for 14 months also showed no
observable onset of crystallinity via p-XRD analysis (Supple-
mentary
Fig.
7).

Physiologically based pharmacokineticsimulations. Using this

model
(see
Methods), Caco-2 cell data were used to predict the pharmaco-
kinetics of SDN (with highest apparent permeability from the
screen) and the traditional formulation of LPV in a virtual cohort
of 100 patients receiving standard doses of 400/100 mg twice daily
(Supplementary Fig. 8). The simulation predicted a higher Cmax
(maximum concentration achieved in the plasma; 11.915±3.631
versus
7.449±2.916 mg l � 1)
and
higher
Cmin
(minimum
concentration in the plasma at the time of second dose;
6.045±2.736 versus 4.023±1.981 mg l � 1) for the SDN versus the
conventional formulation.
In vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation of spray-dried LPV SDNs.
The pharmacokinetics of the orally dosed LPV SDNs and
LPV/RTV combination SDNs was studied in vivo by WuX-
iAppTec (http://www.wuxiapptec.com/) in compliance with their
internal policies. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed
with conventional preclinical formulations of LPV or LPV/RTV
and equivalent aqueous SDN dispersions. Blood samples were
taken over 12 h and plasma concentrations of LPV and/or RTV
were determined using mass spectrometry (Fig. 3c–h). LPV
exposure after dosing of single-component SDNs or conventional
preclinical formulation was not significantly different despite the
absence of organic liquids to aid dissolution: average Cmax
LPV ¼ 187 ng ml � 1 and LPV SDN ¼ 155 ng ml � 1 (P ¼ 0.60);
average area under the curve (AUC) LPV ¼ 579.4 ng ml � 1 h � 1
and LPV SDN ¼ 434 ng ml � 1 h � 1 (P ¼ 0.37); Tmax LPV ¼ 0.6 h
and LPV SDN ¼ 1 h (P ¼ 0.68).
Comparison of LPV plasma concentrations for rats orally
dosed with LPV/RTV (4:1) combination SDNs (Fig. 3f) and
equivalent preclinical formulations (Fig. 3e) showed lower
pharmacokinetic exposure to LPV after administration of the
combination SDN, but these differences did not reach statistical
significance:
average
LPV/RTV
Cmax ¼ 1,738 ng ml � 1
and
LPV/RTV SDN ¼ 1,194 ng ml � 1 (P ¼ 0.23); average LPV/RTV
AUC ¼ 10,540 ng ml � 1 h � 1
and
LPV/RTV
SDN ¼ 8,423
ng ml � 1 h � 1 (P ¼ 0.33). The similarity of LPV plasma concen-
trations from combination SDNs is remarkable with relatively
poor
RTV
absorption
with
average
AUC
calculated
as
213 ng ml � 1 h � 1 from the conventional preclinical formulation
and 28 ng ml � 1 h � 1 for combination SDNs (Po0.05).
The observation that plasma RTV concentrations were lower in
the LPV/RTV SDN despite equivalent LPV exposure is counter-
intuitive given that RTV is needed to attain therapeutic
LPV concentrations. To clarify this, the concentrations of LPV
and RTV were investigated in hepatic tissue homogenates.

 Interestingly,
LPV
hepatic
concentrations
were
15.2±
13.7 ng g � 1 versus 1.5±3.4 for the conventional versus the
LPV/RTV SDN formulation, respectively (P ¼ 0.048). Conversely,
RTV
hepatic
concentrations
were
equivalent
between
the
conventional and the LPV/RTV SDN formulation at 10.8±7.5
versus 6.6±6.7 ng g � 1, respectively (P ¼ 0.41). Therefore, a
change in LPV route of entry into the systemic circulation (for
example, via the lymphatics) may reduce entry via the hepatic
portal vein directly to the liver, meaning a lower hepatic LPV
concentration and a reduction in RTV concentrations necessary
for pharmacoenhancement. However, further experimentation
would be needed to confirm this mechanism.
Due to all of these observations, the single-component LPV
SDN formulation was progressed to enable more flexibility for
RTV dosing within subsequent clinical trials (that is, the dose of
RTV needed for optimal pharmacoenhancement can be titrated
in humans using conventional RTV tablets, which would not be
possible using a fixed-dose combination LPV/RTV SDN). For
clarity, these initial human trials will considerably inform the
drug ratios within candidate combination LPV/RTV SDNs and
the development of target ethanol-free paediatric therapies. It is
notable that a general reduction of variability was observed in
both in vivo studies, potentially offering greater predictability if
this behaviour is replicated in future human studies.
Storage characterization of ESD LPV SDN formulations. ESD
powders containing LPV SDNs were filled into Size 0 Vcaps Plus
HPMC capsules (Capsugel) to a dose of 150 mg of LPV per
capsule, placed in 50 ml high-density polyethylene bottles and
subjected to accelerated storage stability testing for 6 months at
40 �C/75% RH and for 12 months at 25 �C/60% RH to establish
long-term stability before submission for approval of first-in-
human clinical studies. In both cases, analysis by HPLC showed
related substances below limits defined within the US Pharma-
copeial Convention specification18, confirming viability as a
candidate clinical nanomedicine (Supplementary Tables 11
and 12).
Discussion
The treatment of HIV requires oral dosing as the only patient-
acceptable daily administration option. Chronic oral dosing has
significant complications that arise from the high pill burden
experienced by many patients across populations with varying
conditions leading to subsequent non-adherence to regimens.
Recent evaluation
of
HIV patient
groups have
shown a
willingness to switch to nanomedicine alternatives if benefits
can be shown19 and research efforts focused on the development
of long-acting subcutaneous and intramuscular injections, using
SDNs produced via milling approaches, may address many oral
dosing challenges20. However, until long-acting combination
therapies are available orally dosed ARVs will continue to be
mainstay therapies.
Orally dosed SDNs have been successfully deployed for many
disease conditions and the use of appropriate SDNs for HIV is a
natural progression. Circulating SDNs are not expected to be
present after gut absorption and, in our current study, the SDN
benefits are likely derived from benefits in the intestine without
reliance on added solvents; as suggested by their stability at
varying pH (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5), the SDNs are expected
to remain as intact nanoparticles in the intestine, thereby
presenting the observed benefits. The pharmacokinetic (PK)
profiles in rodents are very encouraging and offer the ability to
provide a novel aqueous dosing format at identical dosing levels,
but without the use of ethanol and with the storage benefits of a
re-dispersible solid, in contrast to the current liquid product
containing volatile solvents.
Although the data are highly promising, the rat studies
presented here do not necessarily correlate directly to human
adult, or paediatric, PK behaviour and the full opportunities for
SDNs of ARVs will only be truly seen after oral dosing to
humans. Although the single-component LPV SDNs have been
progressed to clinical manufacturing scale, opportunities may also
be available for the combination LPV/RTV SDNs. Indeed, the
maintenance of Cmin with reduced LPV Cmax and reduced overall
exposure to RTV observed in rat studies may be important in the
context of concentration-dependent and chronic-exposure toxi-
cities for these drugs21. It is also worth noting that early screening
identified
formulations
with
the
potential
for
augmented
exposure but for the purposes of this project, and simplified
regulatory
acceptance,
a
single-component
LPV
paediatric
formulation with the potential for bioequivalence in an entirely
aqueous format is being progressed to clinical evaluation
(EudraCT number 2013-004913-41) due to the pressing clinical
need for ethanol-free therapy options.
Preliminary ESD studies to establish commercially relevant
manufacture of combination SDNs were successful through
simple substitution of 20 wt% of LPV with RTV. Currently,
the
clinical
LPV/RTV
solid-dose
formulation
(Kaletra)
is
processed by melt extrusion and the paediatric liquid formu-
lation has limited shelf-life of 2 months (at 25 �C) if not
refrigerated, making this option non-ideal for use in sub-Saharan
Africa22.
The increasing demand for ARV manufacture is a growing
concern and the data generated for the SDNs studied here do not
appear to offer routes to decrease oral dose. However, the
nanomedicine options presented are cheap to produce in a simple

 manufacturing process, and have a demonstrated 6-month shelf-
life at elevated temperature that should allow a reduction in
distribution costs with a predicted decrease in waste.
The strategy described throughout this study is explicitly
illustrated in Fig. 4, and has a number of key benefits. First, it is
clear that the ETFD screening strategy allows for a large number
of SDN nanoparticle options to be generated and rapidly assessed
for chemical and physical properties. This is unique within our
accelerated strategy as hundreds of SDN options may be
generated within days, allowing for multiple options to be
removed from the evaluation process, in contrast to the relatively
small number of SDN options that could be studied in an
identical period using homogenization or nano-milling. Second, it
is also clear that the libraries of SDNs behave very differently
pharmacologically and it would be impossible to predict which
initial combination of excipients would provide the appropriate
size, surface charge, stability and permeability to provide the best
options for further study; in essence, by generating and testing the
large number of options, any discipline prejudice is removed and
the SDNs select themselves for progression. This is important as a
conventional serial approach is unlikely to identify optimum
materials from limited data sets.
The number of potential options identified does present a
series of issues as seen in Fig. 2e; options to enhance
bioavailability were present within the initial gut-model permea-
tion evaluation but the target within this study was the generation
of bioequivalent options that would presumably avoid potential
complications that can arise from fundamentally new absorption
and bio-distribution as seen with some previous clinically
accepted nanomedicines23,24. In addition, the screening process
allowed
multiple
optimization
steps
to
be
simultaneously
attempted to increase drug loading relative to excipients. If
conducted in a stepwise and serial manner, this parallel approach
would have taken considerably longer to achieve very high
loadings. Finally, the progression to clinical manufacture through
ESD has created a commercially viable nanotherapy, identified
through library-based screening utilizing just 1 mg per library
sample and translated to near-kg scale production ready for
human trials. This has considerable implications for future
SDN-based nanomedicine development programmes as the
timescale of initial laboratory screening to human evaluation
(o4 years) should provide a pathway for acceleration of a range
of new therapeutic opportunities. At the time of manuscript
preparation, the authors have received UK Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approval for human
bioequivalence trials and will be commencing dosing to healthy
volunteers in the near future.
Methods
Material details and some routine experimental information are available in the
Supplementary Methods.
Preparation of emulsion-templated freeze-dried monoliths. Stock solutions
of LPV or 4:1 LPV/RTV (10, 50 or 70 mg ml � 1 in chloroform), polymer
(P; 22.5 mg ml � 1 in water) and surfactant (S; 22.5 mg ml � 1 in water) were
prepared using standard techniques. The three stock solutions were added to a
sample tube, along with additional water (W) in the following API:P:S:W (ml)
ratios: 100:267:133 (10 wt% API, 60 wt% P and 30 wt% S), 100:178:45:177 (50 wt%
API, 40 wt% P and 10 wt% S) and 100:90:45:265 (70 wt% API, 20 wt% P and
10 wt% S) to form a total solid mass (10 mg) in a 1:4 chloroform/water mixture.
The samples were emulsified using either a Hielscher UP400S ultrasonic processor
equipped with H3 probe at 50% (Wattage) output intensity for 7 s or using a
Covaris S2x acoustic homogenization system for 30 s with a duty cycle of 20, an
intensity of 10 and 500 cycles/burst in frequency sweeping mode. Samples were
cryogenically frozen immediately and lyophilized using a Virtis benchtop K freeze-
dryer for 48 h. If required, 1H-labeled LPV was added to the chloroform stock
solution to generate radioactive SDNs.
Preparation of emulsion spray-dried powders. (Note: the following describes
300 ml scale processing). API stock solutions of LPV or 4:1 LPV/RTV
(200 mg ml � 1 in dichloromethane), polymer (P) PVA (grade 4–88, MW 57–
77,000; 50 mg ml � 1 in water) and surfactant (S) Kolliphor TPGS (50 mg ml � 1 in
water) were prepared using standard techniques. Three stock solutions were mixed
in the API:P:S ratio 60:192:48 (ml) in a 1:4 dichloromethane to water mixture.
Emulsified was conducted using a Hielscher UP400S ultrasonic processor equipped
with H14 Probe at 100% output (140 W) for 300 s, with immediate spray-drying
using a benchtop spray-dryer (BUCHI Mini-290) with an air-atomizing nozzle and
compressed air as the drying gas. Spray-drying process conditions: 7 ml min � 1
solution flow rate; 65 �C outlet temperature; and 110 �C inlet temperature.
Resultant powders were dried under vacuum for 48 h.
Cytotoxicity studies. Cytotoxicity was conducted as previously described9. In
brief, caco-2 cells were seeded at 2.5 � 104 cells 100 ml � 1 into a 96-well plate and
incubated for 24 h. Media were replaced with media containing 0.1 � 10 � 6,
1 � 10 � 6, 10 � 10 � 6, 100 � 10 � 6, 500 � 10 � 6 or 1,000 � 10 � 6 M LPV SDN or
LPV aqueous solution (o1% dimethylsulphoxide) and incubated for a further 24 h.
Subsequently, CellTiter-Glo Reagent (100 ml) was added and luminescence was
measured after 10 min using a Tecan Genios plate reader (Tecan; Austria). In
addition, the 50 wt% loaded spray-dried lead LPV SDN toxicity was assessed in
Caco-2 cells. Media were replaced with media containing 0.1 � 10 � 6, 0.2 � 10 � 6,
0.39 � 10 � 6, 0.78 � 10 � 6, 1.56 � 10 � 6, 3.13 � 10 � 6, 6.25 � 10 � 6, 12.5 � 10 � 6,
25 � 10 � 6 or 50 � 10 � 6 M LPV as either aqueous solution or in SDN form
(o1% dimethylsulphoxide) and incubated for a further 24 h. Excipients present in
the SDN (PVA and TPGS) were also assessed using the concentrations ranging
from 500 � 10 � 6 to 1 � 10 � 6 M. Analysis was performed as described above.
Cellular accumulation studies. Cellular accumulation was determined as pre-
viously described9. In brief, caco-2 cells were seeded at 5 � 106 per well and after
24 h, media was replaced with HBSS containing 10 � 10 � 6 M (final concentration)
LPV in either solution or SDN form with 0.1 mCi of 3H LPV as a tracer. After
60 min, an extracellular sample (100 ml) was placed into a scintillation vial. Cells
were lysed in water (500 ml) and plates were incubated for 24 h at � 20 �C. Ultima
gold liquid scintillation cocktail (4 ml) was added to intracellular and extracellular
samples and radioactivity detected using a Perkin Elmer 3100TS scintillation
counter. CARs were calculated as the ratio of intracellular/extracellular
concentrations.
Transcellular permeability studies. Transcellular permeability assays utilized
Caco-2 cells propagated to a monolayer over 21 days, yielding transepithelial
electrical resistance values of 41,300 O. LPV solution or LPV SDNs (10 � 10 � 6 M;
including 0.1 mCi 3H LPV) was added to the donor chamber of four wells and a
sample was drawn (and replaced) from the receiver compartment over 4 h. In
addition, the transcellular permeability of 50 wt% loaded spray-dried lead LPV
SDN was assessed through single-, dual- and triple-culture monolayer models, as
described previously16. Mannitol permeability was used to determine monolayer
integrity as described above. Antipyrene was assessed as a high permeability
control compound that is largely unaffected by the presence of a mucous layer or
M cells.For the PBPK modelling, virtual patients were generated using a population
physiology model25. Oral absorption was simulated using a compartmental
absorption and transit model and the volume of distribution was simulated using
the Poulin and Theil method26–29. The PBPK model was designed using
Simbiology v.4.3.1, a product of Matlab v.8.2 (MathWorks, Natick, MA, 2013).
In vitro data describing physicochemical properties, absorption, distribution,
metabolism and elimination of LPV and RTV were determined experimentally or
obtained from the literature. The PK of LPV/RTV was simulated in 100 virtual
individuals treated with 400/100 mg bid. The impact of SDN on the absorption and
pharmacokinetics of LPV was simulated considering the highest and lowest Papp
obtained for the apparent permeability assay in Caco-2 cells.
In vivo studies. In vivo analyses were conducted using adult male Sprague-Dawly
rats (200–300 g; five animals per group). Animals were surgically implanted with a
catheter in a carotid artery using polyethylene tubing heparin (50I U ml � 1)/glucose
(50%) used as the lumen lock solution and allowed to recover for 3–5 days before
the experiment. Doses were prepared on the day of the experiment and adminis-
tered via oral gavage. Blood samples (0.25 ml) were collected via the catheter at the
presented time points post dose. Plasma was prepared within 30 min of being
drawn and stored at � 70 �C until analysis of LPV and RTV (where relevant)
by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. SDN formulations were
dispersed in water before administration, whereas conventional formulations
consisted of 95% propylene glycol with 5% ethanol (as used in preclinical
development by the originator)30.
