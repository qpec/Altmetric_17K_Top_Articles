Abstract
 Background & Aims—Celiac disease is a common disorder with a worldwide distribution, 
though the prevalence among different ethnicities varies. We aimed to measure the prevalence of 
duodenal villous atrophy among patients of different ethnicities throughout the United States (US).
 Methods—We performed a cross-sectional study of all patients who had duodenal biopsies 
submitted to a national pathology laboratory between January 2, 2008 and April 30, 2015. The 
prevalence of villous atrophy was calculated for the following ethnicities, using a previously 
published algorithm based on patient names: North Indian, South Indian, East Asian, Hispanic, 
Middle Eastern, Jewish, and other Americans.

  Results—Among all patients (n=454,885), the median age was 53 years and 66% were 
female. The overall prevalence of celiac disease was 1.74%. Compared to other Americans 
(n=380,163; celiac disease prevalence 1.83%), celiac disease prevalence was lower in patients of 
South Indian (n=177, 0%; P=.08), East Asian (n=4700, 0.15%; P=<.0001), and Hispanic 
(n=31,491, 1.06%; P=<.0001) ethnicities. Celiac disease was more common in patients from the 
Punjab region (n=617, 3.08%) than in others from North India (n=1195, 1.51%; P=.02). The 
prevalence of celiac disease among patients of Jewish (n=17,806, 1.80%; P=.78) and Middle 
Eastern (n=1903, 1.52%; P=.33) ethnicities was similar to that of other Americans. Among Jewish 
individuals (n=17,806), the prevalence of celiac disease was 1.83% in Ashkenazi persons 
(n=16,440) and 1.39% in Sephardic persons (n=1366; P=.24).
 Conclusions—Among patients undergoing duodenal biopsy, individuals from the Punjab 
region of India constitute the ethnic group in the US with the highest prevalence of villous atrophy 
consistent with celiac disease. Compared to other Americans, villous atrophy prevalence on 
duodenal biopsy is significantly lower among US residents of South Indian, East Asian, and 
Hispanic ancestry.

 Introduction
Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-based disorder triggered by the consumption of gluten in 
genetically susceptible people who are subject to as-yet unidentified environmental triggers. 
(1) A recent study found that the overall prevalence of CD in the general population of the 
United States (US) is 0.7%, which is equal to approximately 1.8 million Americans. (1) 
When initially characterized, CD was thought to be a disease of Caucasian Europeans, 
though it is now recognized as one of the most common genetic disorders with a worldwide 
distribution. However, the prevalence in different ethnicities varies. (2) The prevalence of 
CD among Europeans is thought to be about 1-1.5% (2) with a similar estimated prevalence 
of about 1.1% in the adult Israeli population (3) and 1.2% in the United Arab Emirates, (4) 
while the disease appears to be less common in Indonesia, (2) South Korea, (2) and the 
Philippines (2), which may be related to the lower consumption of wheat in those 
populations. A retrospective study from the Northern part of India reported a significant 
increase in the prevalence of CD in the past decade. (5) In one study of ethnic minorities 
with biopsy-proven CD at a pediatric clinic in Canada (n=54), South Asians were found to 
comprise a significant majority (81%) of the ethnic minorities with CD. (6) Celiac disease in 
the Asia-Pacific region is considered to be under-diagnosed, though there are expectations 
for this to change. (7)
Few studies have investigated racial and ethnic variation of CD prevalence in the US. 
African-Americans and Hispanics undergoing upper endoscopy are less likely to be biopsied 
than Caucasians; therefore, CD may be under diagnosed in these populations. (8) One 
serologic screening study that estimated the prevalence of CD in the US population found 
the disease to be predominantly present in non-Hispanic Caucasians and less common 
among Hispanics and non-Hispanic African-Americans. (1) There is also uncertainty

 regarding whether the female predominance observed in European studies of CD (9-11) 
applies to different ethnicities in the US.
In this study, we aimed to measure the prevalence of duodenal villous atrophy (the histologic 
hallmark of CD) among different ethnicities throughout the US. Using a large pathology 
database of duodenal samples from endoscopic procedures performed by US physicians and 
diagnosed by a central group of pathologists, we sought to quantify the prevalence of CD 
among individuals of different ethnic backgrounds, all of whom underwent duodenal biopsy. 
We also aimed to determine whether the gender distribution in CD differed between these 
ethnic groups.
 Methods
 Data source
We used a large national pathology database of subjects who underwent esophago-gastro-
duodenoscopy (EGD) with duodenal biopsy between January 2, 2008 and April 30, 2015 in 
endoscopy centers distributed throughout the US. The mucosal biopsy specimens were 
evaluated and reported by a single group of gastrointestinal pathology fellowship-trained 
histopathologists at three different laboratories of Miraca Life Sciences. Pathologists 
participate in daily consensus conferences and each reviews specimens from multiple 
different states. All data were derived from pre-existing records. No direct contact with 
either patients or health care providers was made and no individual patient information was 
revealed. All patient records were de-identified before being analyzed.
 Ethnicity categories
A series of computer algorithms based on first and last name analysis were used to 
categorize patients by ethnicity. This method of ethnic classification, modified from similar 
existing models, (12,13) and described in detail in a recent publication, (14) was first 
validated by a progressive process, which consisted of adjusting the algorithms against lists 
of persons of known ethnicity until the specificity was greater than 95%. This level of 
specificity compares favorably to that of self-reported ethnic classification (15,16) and is 
substantially more accurate than the assignment of ethnicity by visual inspection as 
determined by the IC codes used in the United Kingdom. (17) The last validation step, 
specific for this cohort of patients, included pre-arranged visits to medical practices where 
substantial numbers of patients of different ethnicities were recruited and had telephone 
interviews with practice managers. These visits and interviews, aimed at determining the 
level of coincidence between the ethnic categories assigned by our algorithm and the 
ethnicities recorded by the practices, revealed an essentially perfect concurrence. Using this 
approach, patients were stratified into the following ethnicities: North Indian (with further 
subdivision into Punjabis or Other North Indian), South Indian, East Asian, Hispanic, 
Middle Eastern, Jewish (with further subdivision into Ashkenazi or Sephardic), and Other 
Americans. The latter group served as a reference and included individuals (mostly 
Caucasians and African-Americans) not specifically associated with any of the other ethnic 
groups. Patients with a combination of names that suggested more than one ethnicity (3.7%) 
were classified as undetermined and excluded from further analysis.

  Celiac disease
We calculated the prevalence of CD among each of the ethnic groups described above. 
Patients were considered to have CD if duodenal biopsies showed villous atrophy. We then 
calculated the prevalence of various degrees of villous atrophy: partial villous atrophy 
(corresponding to Marsh 3A) and subtotal or total villous atrophy (Marsh 3B and Marsh 
3C). (18)
 Statistical analysis
The distributions by age, gender, and ethnicity were calculated and expressed as a 
percentage of the total study population. The prevalence of CD among different ethnicities 
was compared using the chi square test, with the group “Other Americans” serving as a 
reference for all comparisons. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
were calculated using logistic regression. We then recalculated ORs and 95% CIs, adjusting 
for age and gender. Because gastric colonization with H. pylori varies by ethnicity (19) and 
the presence of H. pylori correlates inversely with CD, (20) we then additionally adjusted for 
H. pylori status using a multivariate model restricted to those individuals who had a 
concurrent gastric biopsy.
The prevalence of CD between the genders was compared overall and then stratified by 
ethnicity. We used logistic regression to measure the association between female gender and 
CD using ORs and 95% CIs; we then adjusted for age and H. pylori status.
We used SAS (Cary, NC) version 9.4 for all analyses. All reported p values are 2-sided. The 
Institutional Review Board of Columbia University Medical Center deemed this “non-
human subjects research” since the data were stripped of all identifiers before being 
provided to the investigators.
 Results
During the study period, there were 458,256 unique individuals with duodenal biopsies. We 
excluded 11 for likely erroneous age (recorded as over 99 years). Additionally, we excluded 
2,931 patients whose biopsies showed duodenal neoplasia and 429 patients whose biopsies 
showed Giardia lamblia. The remaining 454,885 patients served as our study population. 
Demographic information and histologic findings are summarized in Table 1. The median 
age was 53 years and the majority of patients (75%) were older than 40 years; 66% were 
female. The most common indications for duodenal biopsy were gastroesophageal reflux 
disease, dyspepsia/epigastric pain, anemia, and diarrhea (see Table 1). CD was diagnosed in 
7,928 patients, equivalent to 1.74% of those who underwent duodenal biopsy. The 
prevalence villous atrophy consistent with CD varied by indication for biopsy; it was lowest 
(1.25%) among those with gastroesophageal reflux disease, and highest (2.04%) among 
those with diarrhea.
Table 2 shows the prevalence of villous atrophy consistent with CD by ethnicity. Compared 
to the prevalence of CD among Other Americans (1.83%), the lowest prevalence of CD was 
found among patients identified as South Indians (0/177, OR and CI not calculable), East 
Asians (0.15%, OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.04-0.17, p <0.0001), and Hispanics (1.06% OR 0.58,

 95% CI 0.52-0.64, p <0.0001). These comparisons were essentially unchanged when CD 
was subdivided into partial villous atrophy and subtotal/total villous atrophy and when ORs 
were adjusted for age, gender, and H. pylori status (data shown in Table 2). Among North 
Indians, there was a trend toward higher prevalence (2.04%) when compared to Other 
Americans (1.83%) that did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.41, 95% CI 0.99-2.00, 
p=0.06).
Of the 1,812 patients with North Indian origin, 617 were Punjabis; 19 (3.08%) of Punjabi 
patients had villous atrophy consistent with CD. The prevalence of CD was significantly 
higher in Punjabis (3.08%) than that in Other North Indian patients (3.08% vs 1.51% 
(18/1,195); p=0.02) Among Jewish individuals (n=17,806), the prevalence of CD was 1.83% 
(301/16,440) in Ashkenazi subjects and 1.39% in Sephardic subjects (19/1,366, p=0.24).
The distribution of villous atrophy consistent with CD by gender and ethnicity is shown in 
Table 3. Although 5,338 (67%) of the patients with CD were female, this apparent majority 
was due to the fact that females comprised 66% of all individuals undergoing duodenal 
biopsy and the prevalence of CD was nearly identical in males and females (1.7% and 1.8%, 
respectively). The similar prevalence of CD between genders was present across all 
ethnicities, although there was a non-significant trend toward female predominance in North 
Indian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern, and Jewish patients. (Table 3)
Figure 1 shows the prevalence of villous atrophy consistent with CD by age, stratified by 
ethnicity. The distributions were fairly even among the groups where CD was more 
prevalent. There was an increase in CD among Jewish and North Indian patients in the 
youngest age group (0-19 years), although comparisons of the ethnic groups in this age 
stratum did not yield statistically significant differences due to the low number of children 
with CD in these groups.
 Discussion
In our analysis of over 400,000 duodenal biopsies from a nationwide pathology database, we 
found that the prevalence of CD in those undergoing duodenal biopsy was lower in patients 
identified as South Indian, East Asian, and Hispanic when compared to Other Americans. 
North Indian patients identified with ancestry in the Punjab region had a significantly higher 
prevalence of CD on duodenal biopsy compared to all Other North Indian patients. There 
were no significant differences in prevalence of CD between Middle-Eastern and Jewish 
patients when compared with Other Americans.
In this population, the prevalence of CD was 1.74%, slightly more than double the 
prevalence reported in the screening studies. (1,21) Our study population consisted of 
patients undergoing duodenal biopsy for various indications, including symptoms clinically 
suggestive of CD. Significantly fewer Hispanic and East Asian patients were found to have 
CD, which is consistent with prior reports. (2,21-22) Susceptibility to CD is predominantly 
associated with the human leukocyte antigen HLA-DQ2, which varies geographically and is 
found in higher frequency in Western Europe and in portions of Africa and India. (23) In 
studies of CD in India, the prevalence of compatible HLA haplotypes is similar to those in

 Western countries, and does not vary substantially between regions. (24) Large regional 
variation in the wheat consumption in India, (24) is possibly a more significant reason to 
explain why cases of CD in India are primarily reported from Northern regions, with only 
isolated case reports from the rest of the country (25) and virtually no cases reported in 
Southern India, (24) in keeping with the findings of our study. Our finding of a higher 
prevalence of CD in patients with Punjabi ancestry is also consistent with previous reports. 
(26)
Our study population of patients undergoing duodenal biopsy was majority female, which is 
consistent with prior reports in this setting and elsewhere that women undergoing EGD are 
more likely to have duodenal biopsies than men. (8,27) However, we found that CD was 
equally prevalent among men and women undergoing duodenal biopsy, which was true in all 
ethnic groups studied. Several screening studies of CD in the US have shown that CD is 
equally prevalent among men and women, (28-30) but screening studies of children in the 
US (31) and elsewhere (10,11) have shown a female predominance. Regardless of whether 
gender affects the true prevalence of CD, women are more likely to be diagnosed with CD 
than are men. (32) Our findings support the notion that CD should be considered as a 
diagnosis in men as often as it is considered in women.
We found no significant difference in the prevalence of CD on duodenal biopsy between 
patients of Ashkenazi and Sephardic origin. While the high prevalence of inflammatory 
bowel disease in Ashkenazi Jews is well documented, we are not aware of any studies 
investigating the prevalence of CD in Sephardic versus Ashkenazi Jews. One study of the 
prevalence of CD among the adult Jewish population in Israel included only 850 subjects 
and did not differentiate between Ashkenazi and Sephardic ancestry. (3) Our comparison 
may have been limited by the small number of patients of Sephardic ancestry in study 
population.
This study has several strengths, including its large sample size and uniform reporting of 
histologic findings, as all biopsies were read and reported by a central group of pathologists 
with subspecialty training in gastrointestinal pathology, who practice in the same 
environment, use uniform diagnostic criteria and standardized diagnostic codes, and 
participate in daily consensus conferences where cases and diagnostic criteria are discussed. 
Upon review of the reporting of villous atrophy by different pathologists on the same 
specimen, there was good to excellent agreement for variable villous atrophy (Marsh 3a) and 
villous atrophy (Marsh 3b and 3c). As such, diagnosis of duodenal biopsies consistent with 
CD was very consistent across all pathologists. Pathology specimens came from multiple 
centers around the country; thus patients in our study population were representative of the 
US general population and allowed us to generate true prevalence data among patients 
undergoing duodenal biopsy. Although some geographic regions have a higher proportion of 
certain ethnicities, and it is indeed possible that certain pathologists see more patients of a 
certain group, this is unlikely to have biased our results. We found no distinct geographic 
predominance with regards to patients of Indian, Jewish, or Middle Eastern descent. As 
such, there were essentially equal chances that any pathologist interpreted biopsies from 
these ethnicities. The largest proportions of East Asian patients in our patient population are 
in New York, New Jersey, California, Alaska, and Hawaii. These five states have more than

 20 pathologists who share the diagnostic work. Similarly, Hispanic patients are distributed 
almost equally in California, the Southwest (including Texas), and the Northeast. Therefore, 
it is extremely unlikely that all of the pathologists interpreting biopsies from these different 
states have a bias for a low rate of CD diagnosis.
Our study has several limitations. We were able to measure villous atrophy but not the 
clinical entity of CD. As we had no serologic data on patients with duodenal biopsies that 
showed villous atrophy, it is possible that some patients may have been misclassified as 
having CD, although even the most common cause of seronegative villous atrophy is still 
CD. (33) Nevertheless, some patients with alternative causes of villous atrophy (such as 
tropical sprue (33) or sprue-like enteropathy due to olmesartan (34)) would have been 
classified as having CD in this analysis. In particular, multiple studies have shown that 
tropical sprue is still the most common cause of malabsorption syndrome in India (35,36), 
while CD is emerging as a more important cause of malabsorption than previously thought 
(35-37). Still, such cases of tropical sprue and sprue-like enteropathy due to olmesartan are 
far less common than CD in the US. (38,39) Our study population only included those 
undergoing duodenal biopsy; thus our prevalence calculations do not include those patients 
who may be diagnosed with CD based on serology and symptoms alone, nor do they take 
into account undiagnosed CD. As ethnicity was derived based on a name-based algorithm, 
misclassification of ethnicity is possible. For example, the proportion of patients in our 
sample classified as Hispanic was 6.9%, far lower than the prevalence of 16.3% based on 
self-report in the 2010 U.S. Census. (40) However, such misclassification would bias our 
results towards the null, as it is unlikely that misclassification is differential by CD status. 
Therefore, it is possible that the prevalence of CD differs by ethnicity to a greater extent than 
reported in this study. Misclassification was mitigated in part by our excluding patients 
whose names were deemed ambiguous or dual-classified by our algorithm. Another 
limitation to the name-based algorithm is the lack of data on year of immigration to the US, 
which would help inform if and when dietary and other environmental exposures affect the 
risk of CD. While the national setting enhances the generalizability of our findings, the 
pathology specimens were submitted from private offices and ambulatory surgical centers 
and not from hospital-based endoscopy suites, raising the possibility that these data are not 
entirely representative of the US population.
In conclusion, we found that in the US, the prevalence of CD in those undergoing duodenal 
biopsy is significantly lower among patients of South Indian, East Asian, and Hispanic 
descent. Among patients of North Indian descent undergoing duodenal biopsy, CD is 
significantly more common in those from the Punjab region than in all other patients from 
North India. Patients of Jewish and Middle Eastern ethnicity had CD prevalence similar to 
that of other Americans. Men and women had a similar prevalence of villous atrophy on 
duodenal biopsy, regardless of ethnicity. These findings may have clinical relevance to 
gastroenterologists across the US and may aid in their diagnostic practices.
