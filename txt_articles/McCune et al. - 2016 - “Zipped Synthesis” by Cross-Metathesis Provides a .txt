ABSTRACT: The gaseous neuromodulator H2S is associated with neuronal cell death pursuant to cerebral ischemia. As
cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) is the primary mediator of H2S biogenesis in the brain, it has emerged as a potential target for
the treatment of stroke. Herein, a “zipped” approach by alkene cross-metathesis into CBS inhibitor candidate synthesis is
demonstrated. The inhibitors are modeled after the pseudo-C2-symmetric CBS product (L,L)-cystathionine. The “zipped”
concept means only half of the inhibitor needs be constructed; the two halves are then fused by olefin cross-metathesis. Inhibitor
design is also mechanism-based, exploiting the favorable kinetics associated with hydrazine-imine interchange as opposed to the
usual imine−imine interchange. It is demonstrated that the most potent “zipped” inhibitor 6S reduces H2S production in SH-
SY5Y cells overexpressing CBS, thereby reducing cell death. Most importantly, CBS inhibitor 6S dramatically reduces infarct
volume (1 h post-stroke treatment; ∼70% reduction) in a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model for ischemia.
■ INTRODUCTION
In light of evidence of H2S production in rat, bovine, and
human brain tissues,1,2 interest has intensified in its role as the
third gaseous “hormone.”3,4 In particular, H2S appears to be an
important actor in modulating cell function in the vasculature
and in the cerebrum. Three enzymes5−7 have been reported to
produce H2S endogenously, namely, (i) cystathionine β-
synthase (CBS; EC 4.2.1.22), (ii) cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE;
EC 4.4.1.1), and (iii) 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-
MST; EC 2.8.1.2). CBS and CSE eliminate H2S from
L-
cysteine, whereas 3-MST reductively releases H2S from 3-
mercaptopyruvate, itself a product of L-cysteine transamination
via cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). [In vitro, CSE actually
eliminates H2S 3-fold more efficiently from L-homocysteine
than from L-cysteine; however, physiological concentrations of
the latter (100 μM) are estimated to be 10-fold higher than
those of the former (10 μM), making L-cysteine the principal
biological H2S donor for CSE as well.8] Thioredoxin appears to
be the best candidate for the in vivo reductant in the 3-MST
reaction. Once released, H2S may serve as (i) a signaling
molecule itself or is transformed into (ii) sulfhydrated protein
(e.g., through reaction with a protein disulfide), or into (iii)
polysulfides or into (iv) HSNO upon reaction with NO,
another prominent gaseous neuromodulator (a one electron
oxidation).9 So while the mechanism for H2S-signaling is clearly
complex, potentially divergent, and incompletely understood,
important functions have been associated with H2S-signal
transduction in both the cerebrum and the vasculature.
Interestingly, all three biogenetic pathways into H2S emanate
from
L-cysteine and involve a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-
dependent enzyme. The expression of these enzymes seems to
be tissue-specific. CSE has been shown to be primarily involved
with H2S production in the cardiovascular system.10 Con-
versely, studies have indicated that CBS serves as the primary
machinery for H2S production in the brain, and its expression is

 highly concentrated in the astrocytes.11,12 Understanding of
H2S in terms of its biogenesis, in vivo concentration,
bioenergetics, and activity is still in its infancy, with the ability
to measure H2S levels in vivo being one of the principal
challenges, particularly given that it may be “stored” in various
releasable forms. A number of recent reviews9,13−17 on H2S
provide an overview of the complexity of signaling activities
ascribed to H2S as an effector molecule. To further our
understanding of the protective and deleterious effects
associated with H2S going forward, a combination of genetics
and chemical biology will likely be needed. There also is great
interest in developing new and more effective H2S-sensing
platforms.18−25 At this stage, tools that allow for the
modulation of CBS activity in the astrocytes [and correspond-
ingly of CAT/3-MST activity and/or CSE activity in the
vasculature] would be valuable tools to chemical biologists
seeking to understand H2S activity as a function of tissue
location; concentration; cellular conditions; and source (L-
cysteine, L-homocysteine, stored sulfane repository or elemental
S).
H2S Biogenesis. Illustrated in Figure 1a are the two key
biological reactions mediated by CBS (coordinates for PDB
1M54 shown).26 The reaction on the lower left represents the
role of CBS in the transsulfuration pathway through which
sulfur in essential dietary L-methionine is transformed into
essential cellular redox equivalents in the form of glutathione.
Specifically, CBS condenses L-serine with L-homocysteine in a
β-replacement reaction, producing a molecule of (L,L)-
cystathionine and water. This effectively moves the sulfur
atom from its L-methionine source to its L-cysteine destination.
(The methyl group from L-methionine is transferred elsewhere
through the sequential action of three enzymes: SAM
synthetase, SAM-dependent methyl-transferases, and SAH
hydrolase. The resultant
L-homocysteine transfers its sulfur
atom to the β-carbon of L-serine through the consecutive action
of two PLP-enzymes, namely, CBS, forming (L,L)-cystathionine
and CSE, breaking (L,L)-cystathionine down to L-cysteine, α-

from L-cysteine (upper right reaction). (b) A few possible effects of elevated H2S levels on neurological outcomes pursuant to stroke: (i) cAMP-
dependent PKA activation leading to possible NMDA receptor phosphorylation and increased activity; (ii) H2S enhancement of Ca2+ flux into the

elevated H2S levels may augment signaling pathways involved in activating inflammatory cells (microglial cells) causing a discharge of mediators such
as chemokines and cytokines that could further damage the neuron, exacerbating neuronal cell death. (c) Schematic illustrating the design principles

 ketobutyrate, and ammonia.) The second major CBS activity,
illustrated in the upper right section of Figure 1a, represents the
primary H2S-source in the mammalian brain. A suite of CBS-
mediated transformations exists, through which L-cysteine is
paired with a cosubstrate to produce a molecule of H2S, either
by a β-replacement or a β-elimination reaction. Elegant and
comprehensive kinetic studies by Banerjee and co-workers27
have demonstrated (i) the promiscuity of this enzyme in
accepting a variety of nucleophiles in the H2S-generating β-
replacement manifold; (ii) that the by product(s) distribution
associated with H2S production is dependent upon the available
nucleophiles, their physiological concentrations, and their
relevant kinetic parameters (Km, kcat, and kcat/Km); (iii) that
under both maximal velocity and physiological substrate
concentrations, β-replacement of cysteine by homocysteine is
primarily responsible for H2S production by CBS; and (iv) at
high substrate concentrations, CBS accounts for ∼95% of the
total H2S output in the brain.
H2S Forms and Concentrations. Estimates by a variety of
techniques place endogenous cerebral H2S concentration in the
range of 1−160 μM,1,2,9 or even sub-micromolar with a new
monobromobimane-based assay.28 It might seem that such low
H2S levels would be insufficient to induce the range of
physiological responses reported. However, more recently,
Shibuya et al. and others7,29 have found that H2S may be stored
in the form of polysulfides or protein persulfides formed
through the process of sulfhydration. This protein-bound sulfur
appears to function as an intracellular storage form of H2S. In
these studies, H2S is released in the presence of a redox active
thiol such as thioredoxin, or perhaps glutathione. Thus, actual
H2S concentrations may vary significantly as a function of
cellular redox potential. Increased calcium influx to astrocytes
has also been reported to actuate release of the signaling
molecule D-serine, a coagonist of the N-methyl D-aspartate
receptor (NMDAR), thereby potentiating the H2S-signal at this
receptor while signifying possible cross-talk between two PLP-
dependent enzymes in the brain, CBS and serine racemase,
with attendant consequences for neuronal cell damage pursuant
to stroke.
Protective vs Deleterious Effects of H2S as a Function
of Concentration. The role of H2S in the inflammatory
response, another source of neuronal damage (Figure 1b,
schematic iii), has been the subject of considerable debate with
both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles for H2S having been
described. Research from Whiteman has shown that the effect
of H2S on inflammation is a concentration-dependent response
and is dependent upon the rate of H2S generation.30 The
pioneering work of Abe and Kimura showed that high levels of
H2S (130 μM) selectively increase NMDAR-mediated currents
in hippocampal slices.31 Later, this same group reported (Figure
1b, schematic i) that H2S effects on the NMDAR are associated
with an increase in the secondary messenger, cAMP, suggesting
the activation of adenylate cyclase.32 Elevated H2S levels have
been implicated in a wide range of abnormalities and diseases.
Relevant to the collaborative work described herein, Wong et
al. observed that high plasma cysteine levels correlated with
poor clinical outcome of patients suffering from acute stroke.33
In the same study, in an experimental model for stroke on rats,
middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO) measurements of
brain infarction volumes were elevated upon exogenous
introduction (IP or ICV) of cysteine prior to the occlusion,
in a dose-dependent manner. A similar effect was also observed
when an H2S donor, NaSH, was administered. The hypothesis
that the cysteine effect was due to its conversion to H2S by CBS
was further supported when pretreatment with aminooxyacetic
acid (AOAA), a generic PLP-enzyme inhibitor, served to
counteract these effects. Confirmatory evidence for high H2S
concentrations leading to enhanced cell death under ischemia
was obtained in cells overexpressing CBS after knocking in of
the CBS gene.34 Moreover, brain 3-MST activity has been seen
to be down-regulated following acute stroke,35 lending
additional support to the notion that CBS is the key enzyme
modulating levels of cysteine-derived H2S in the cerebral cortex
and that H2S mediates ischemic damage pursuant to stroke.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Design and “Zipped Synthesis” of CBS Inhibitor Array
by Cross-Metathesis. As mentioned above, all three
biogenetic routes to H2S involve PLP-enzymes, but it is CBS
that serves as the principal source of H2S biogenesis in the
brain. Given the evidence implicating elevated cerebral H2S
levels in ischemic neuronal damage, CBS inhibitor development
has emerged as an area of considerable interest. Owing to the
dearth of such inhibitors, previous studies have relied upon
generic PLP-enzyme inhibitors such as AOAA to modulate
CBS activity. To address this, a central goal of this study was to
develop CBS-targeted inhibitors and explore their utility as
tools for chemical biology. Indeed, the Berkowitz laboratory
explores problems at the interface of synthetic organic
chemistry and mechanistic enzymology,36,37 with a long-
standing interest in the inhibition of PLP-dependent
enzymes.38−44 And the Wong laboratory has made a dedicated
effort to develop in vitro and animal models for stroke, with a
particular interest in H2S-signaling.34,45 These complementary
approaches set the stage for the collaborative chemistry/
neurobiology studies detailed herein.
An array of CBS-targeted inhibitors was envisioned, based
upon structural, synthetic, and mechanistic considerations. (i)
Structurally, the notion was to construct a series of compounds
with shape and charge complementarity to (L,L)-cystathionine,
the particular CBS reaction product that presents the greatest
number of binding recognition elements for the enzyme and
that also exhibits the tightest binding to the enzyme (Km ≈ 83
μM vs mM Km values for
L-serine,
L-cysteine, and
L-
homocysteine).46 (ii) Synthetically, the pseudo-C2-symmetry
present in the (L,L)-cystathionine structure would provide the
key to a streamlined “zipped synthesis” route into the inhibitor
library. (iii) Finally, mechanistically, these inhibitors were
designed by careful consideration of pyridoxaldimine chemistry
in PLP-enzyme active sites. Namely, the inhibitor candidates
were designed to be outfitted with vicinal heteroatomic
functional groups (-NHNH2, -ONH2, -NHOH) in place of
the usual α-amino groups. This is because such derivatives have
the potential to display especially favorable binding kinetics
with respect to cofactor-adduction. This is borne out by a
careful survey of the literature, as is laid out in detail in Figure
S10 of the Supporting Information. Whereas for α-hydrazino
acids, imine-hydrazone interchange (i.e., transaldimination) is
1−2 orders of magnitude slower than the corresponding
imine−imine interchange for native α-amino acid substrates in
the forward direction (i.e., kon), the reverse reaction is some 4−
6 orders of magnitude slower (i.e., koff) for the former (t(1/2)off
≈ 0.02−1 s) vs the latter (t(1/2)off ≈ 2.5 h). In simple terms,
the price that one pays in terms of attenuated kon kinetics is
more than compensated for by greatly diminished koff rates for
the α-hydrazino-acids vs α-amino-acids resulting in an

 anticipated ∼103-fold advantage in effective equilibrium
constant for covalent cofactor adduction for such compounds.
Following this analysis, we chose to design our library as is
illustrated in Figure 1c, retrosynthetically replacing the central
thioether linkage with an “isosteric” CC linkage. (Consider
here the difficulty of separating thiophene impurities from
benzene. In this case, after replacing the central S with at CC
element, a single methylene is removed so as convert a
pseudosymmetric inhibitor target into a perfectly symmetrical
one). This introduces actual C2-symmetry into the inhibitor
design, and, most importantly, enables these inhibitors to be
“zipped” together by Grubbs cross-metathesis chemistry47 from
a single “half-inhibitor” precursor, greatly streamlining the
chemistry. The broad functional group compatibility48 of the
metathesis chemistry makes it especially appropriate for this
application in chemical biology. Highlighted in Figure 2 are the
key synthetic transformations leading to the focused library of
CBS inhibitor candidates targeted herein. Starting from (S)-
glycidol, O-THP-protection, and vinyl cuprate-mediated
epoxide ring-opening efficiently yield the important
D-α-
hydroxy-4-pentenol-derived chiral synthon 3. Compound 3
proved to be a key common intermediate for a series of
modified Mitsunobu reactions (∼70% yield for each series) in
which the Cα-hydroxyl group is stereospecifically substituted
with an α-effect nucleophile, with inversion of configuration,
giving (i) the bis-Boc-protected hydrazine 4, (ii) the N-
phthalimide-protected aminooxy compound 7, or (iii) the N-
Boc-O-o-nitrobenzyl-protected hydroxylamine 10. The zipped
approach of streamlining the construction of such inhibitors by
exploiting C2-symmetry proved to be quite effective, allowing
for swift assembly of the carbon backbone via convergent
alkene cross-metathesis. The Grubbs first generation catalyst
serves to zip together the two halves of the targeted inhibitors
quite cleanly (“spot to spot” reactions, albeit with two
geometric isomers being formed; ∼80% yields). Following
these convergent cross-metathesis transformations, tailoring
chemistry was performed in order to separate the geometric
isomers and set the desired oxidation state. These operations

finally (iii) a convenient global deprotection strategy to unveil a
3 × 3 array of CBS inhibitor candidates.
Enzyme Kinetics: CBS Inhibition Studies. CBS inhibition
assays were performed on the heterologously expressed human
enzyme, hCBSΔC143 construct. This truncated form of the
enzyme lacking the C-terminal regulatory domain is known to
form a highly active dimeric enzyme that has been characterized
structurally.49 A comprehensive assessment of inhibitor
candidate fitness was conducted utilizing three distinct assays
for hCBS activity: (i) a modified continuous assay, exploiting
microscopic reversibility, allowed for measurement of the
cystathionine-lyase activity of hCBS, followed by trapping of
the L-homocysteine produced with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitroben-
zoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman’s reagent) and spectroscopically
quantifying the m-carboxy-p-nitrothiophenolate anion (λmax =
412 nm; Δε412 = 13 600 M−1 cm−1) thereby released; (ii) a
radioactive label-based assay reporting on the forward trans-
sulfuration reaction catalyzed by hCBS using 14C-labeled L-
serine in the presence of L-homocysteine to measure
14C-
labeled (L,L)-cystathionine product. And, most importantly,
(iii) a modified H2S-sensing assay to measure hCBS-catalyzed
production of H2S from
L-cysteine. Capture of the H2S
produced by Pb(OAc)2 leads to the formation of PbS and a
concomitant increase in Abs300 (Figure 3a,b).
Both the (L,L)-cystathionine lyase-activity and radioactive
assay identified the fully saturated α-(L,L)-bis-hydrazino acid 6S
to be the most potent CBS inhibitor candidate (see Supporting
Information). Furthermore, It should be noted that assays
involving the hydroxylamino acid compounds 12E, 12Z, and
12S (designed as “nitrone-formers”) were not compatible with
the continuous assay. When tested in the radioactive assay, both

 the aminooxy (-ONH2 series) and hydrazino acid (-NHNH2
series) inhibitor classes significantly outperformed the hydrox-
ylamino acid class (-NHOH series). This is consistent with the
spectroscopic studies involving incubation with PLP directly
(see below and Figure 3c), the results of which point to the
greater predilection of PLP to engage in hydrazone (-NHNH2
series) and oxime (-ONH2 series) linkages, in comparison with
nitrone linkages (-NHOH series). Given the promise associated
with the hydrazone-forming strategy in particular here, further
kinetic analysis was performed on the most promising inhibitor
candidate, 6S, this time monitoring its effect on CBS-mediated
H2S formation directly. Using the aforementioned Pb-based
spectrophotometric H2S sensing assay, 6S was found to display
a kinetic pattern consistent with clean competitive inhibition of
the CBS with respect to L-cysteine, yielding Ki = 48 ± 2 μM.
As noted, to test the inhibitor design strategy, a series of
model experiments was conducted by incubation of specific
inhibitor candidates of each functional group class with PLP in
solution. PLP-adduct formation with the saturated inhibitor
candidates 6S, 9S, and 12S was monitored by UV/vis
spectroscopy (Figure 3c). These model experiments were
deemed particularly important because hCBS contains a critical
heme domain that absorbs broadly in the UV/vis from 325 to
500 nm,49 thereby blocking the spectral region in which one
typically observes the active site internal PLP-aldimine (λmax ≈
420 nm) and related PLP-adducts. Displayed in Figure 3c are
the spectroscopic profiles of compound 6S and 9S, respectively,
upon incubation with PLP. For each model experiment, the
spectrum indicates that at t = 0 no complex has formed. The
absorption peak at λmax = 388 nm is attributed to free PLP; over
time, additional peaks appear and the peak at 388 nm
diminishes as covalent cofactor adduct formation proceeds.
The projected hydrazone-forming compound 6S, for example,
when incubated with PLP, gives rise to absorbance peaks at 305
and 329 nm. A different spectroscopic signature for the putative
oxime-former 9S appears with absorbances at 270 and 325 nm.
It should be noted that the saturated N-hydroxy amino acid
compound 12S was also tested in the same manner. However,
the data do not provide evidence for the formation of a stable
nitrone adduct with the cofactor under these conditions. The
apparent PLP-hydrazone, on the other hand, is reminiscent of
the carbidopa hydrazone that forms in the active site of
peripheral DOPA decarboxylase (combination therapy for
Parkinson’s disease).50,51 Indeed, in spectroscopic studies
conducted for carbidopa52 (100 μM) and PLP (10 μM)
alone, hydrazone formation was characterized by two
absorption bands at λmax = 305 and 335 nm (t1/2 = 1.19
min) and a shoulder around 380 nm. Thus, the preponderance
of evidence suggests that 6S and 9S are able to engage the PLP
cofactor in stable hydrazone and oxime adduct linkages,
respectively, but it remains an open question as to whether
12S can engage the cofactor in a stable nitrone linkage, at least
in aqueous solution. Given these encouraging results,
compound 6S was advanced into the chemical biology stage
of the investigation, including examination of performance in
both in vitro cell-based assay and in vivo assay using a rat middle
cerebral artery occlusion model for stroke.

 in brain whole cell lysates were consistent with the in vitro
kinetic assays previously described (Ki ≈ 50 μM for H2S
production). Moreover, in neuroblastoma model studies
simulating ischemic conditions through oxygen and glucose
deprivation (OGD) (Figure 4), SH-SY5Y overexpressing CBS
(CBSOE cells) were treated with concentrations of L-cysteine
and
L-homocysteine that represent estimated physiological
substrate concentrations (red),53 on the one hand, and high
concentrations (green), on the other. These experiments were
conducted in the absence or presence of CBS inhibitor 6S (100
and 500 μM). As shown in Figure 4, the cell viability of CBSOE
cells was reduced to ∼50% when subjected to OGD for 24 h.
When physiological substrate concentrations were used, there
was no significant change in cell viability as compared to the no
substrate control. However, when substrate concentrations
were increased 10-fold to mimic stroke conditions, a significant
loss in cell viability to <10% was observed, presumably due to
the high levels of H2S production through the action of CBS.34
As expected, cell viability was largely restored by addition of
inhibitor 6S. Indeed, the SH-SY5Y CBS overexpressing cells
responded in a dose-dependent manner (see Figure S16 in the
Supporting Information for details) to rescue with 6S, with
nearly full restoration to control levels being observed at 500
μM of inhibitor. These results are consistent with reports that
the effects of H2S on neuronal damage33,54 and macrophages55
are dependent on the H2S concentration at the time of insult.
Rat Stroke Model: Transient Middle Cerebral Artery
Occlusion (tMCAO). Next, an in vivo tMCAO rat model study
was undertaken to ascertain whether the observed inhibition of
CBS in vitro, and inhibition of H2S biogenesis in SH-SY5Y CBS
overexpressing cells lysate by 6S would translate into
attenuation of infarction volume in a rat stroke model. In the
event, the middle cerebral artery was transiently blocked for
100 min to induce tissue infarction in the following 24 h
window. Illustrated in Figure 5, infarct volumes were
determined in brain slices stained with TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl-
2H-tetrazolium chloride). In this assay, tissues undergoing
active respiration exhibit significant succinate dehydrogenase
activity and this manifests itself in reduction of the TTC
indicator, producing triphenylformazan (TPF) a red-colored
dye. By contrast, those regions suffering from necrosis exhibit a
markedly lower local redox potential, and fail to reduce the
tetrazolium salt to the corresponding formazan dye, resulting in
unstained regions indicative of infarction. The volume of
unstained tissue relative to the hemispherical volume was then
experimentally quantified and used as a measure of infarction
volume. As can be seen in Figure 6c, this lead compound 6S
(1.6 μmol/kg, intracerebroventricular injection) protected
against infarction, with an 83% or 66% reduction in infarction
volume being seen, relative to control when the inhibitor was
injected 30 min prior to or 60 min after the start of tMCAO,
respectively. These results clearly demonstrate a pharmaco-
logical effect of the inhibitor in an in vivo setting. In addition, 6S

 appeared to have no effect on cerebral blood flow as observed
in the first 30 min after administration but before the onset of
tMCAO in the pretreatment group (Figure 5b). The fact that
this inhibitor remained effective when given as a post-stroke
treatment following the onset of occlusion is encouraging as
this is the norm in the treatment of acute stroke.
Modulating the Microglial Response in the Presence
of the CBS Inhibitor. In light of these encouraging results,
experiments were also conducted to examine whether the
dramatic reduction in infarct volume observed upon ICV
treatment with 6S might correlate with a reduction in microglial
activation. Microglia account for 10−15% of all brain cells. In
the normal brain, microglia exist as ramified star-like cells
known as resting microglia. In disease or injury, microglia are
first transformed into activated microglia with thicker processes
and larger cell bodies, and then into large amoeboid shape
phagocytic microglia. They function as scavengers through
phagocytosis of dead/apoptotic cells, cellular debris, and
foreign materials such as viruses and bacteria. They can also
release cytotoxic free radicals and activate pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines. Figure 6a shows OX-42 immuno-
positive microglia in the cortex and striatum. Resident microglia
mostly in the resting state can be seen in the sham-operated
group. The tMCAO group shows microglial activation as
evidenced by the increase in number and change in
morphology. However, treatment with CBS inhibitor 6S
markedly attenuates the microglial activation. Furthermore,
staining for ED-1, a marker for macrophages including
phagocytic microglia, shows many such cells in the tMCAO
group. This marker, too, was correspondingly reduced in the
CBS inhibitor-treated group. In contrast, macrophages are not
detected in the sham-operated group (Figure 6d). These
observations are supported by the Western blot data (Figure
6b,c and e, f). Overall, treatment with 6S leads to a significant
decrease in microglial activation as a result of reduced tissue
damage induced by tMCAO. These results provide support for
the idea that targeted blockade of H2S-production in ischemic
tissues may dampen the inflammatory response, in addition to
attenuating infarction.
■ CONCLUSIONS
The studies described herein articulate design elements for the
inhibition of hCBS that are likely generalizable to other enzyme
targets, particularly those dependent upon PLP. These design

immunopositive microglial cells observed in the Sham-operated (S) group are resting microglia based on their ramified star-like morphology. Marked
increase in the number of microglia was observed in the tMCAO (T) group. Many of these cells are activated as they appeared to be large with thick
processes. In the CBSI 6S-treated tMCAO (T + I) group, the number of activated microglia was reduced although still increased when compared to

 principles include (i) choosing that enzymatic product, (L,L)-
cystathionine here, that presents the largest binding surface as a
platform for inhibitor design, even if that product is not
produced in the reaction being targeted for tissue-localized
inhibition (H2S production here). Next, (ii) the pseudo-C2-
symmetry in the cognate substrate may be exploited to greatly
simplify inhibitor candidate construction, by allowing for the
stereocontrolled synthesis of one-half of the inhibitor structure,
in this case, followed by a melding of the two halves by a quite
efficient Ru-mediated alkene cross-metathesis transformation
mediated by the Grubbs first generation catalyst. Finally, (iii)
these studies support the use of an X-Y affinity reagent
functionality in place of the α-amino group to develop PLP
enzyme inhibitor candidates, but, at the same time, point to the
advantage of surveying a range of such X-Y functionalities as
significant structure/activity relationship (SAR) may be seen.
Indeed, key results here include the observation that CBS
inhibitors mimicking the (L,L)-cystathionine structure but
bearing α-hydrazino functionality in place of the α-amino
groups are most effective in blocking hCBS activity, presumably
via active site PLP-hydrazone formation, consistent with model
studies. The most effective inhibitor, 6S, displays a Ki lower
than the best substrate Km yet reported (for (L,L)-cystathionine
itself) and, to our knowledge, the lowest Ki reported to date for
a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. Compound 6S also
exhibits functional irreversible inhibition (exhaustive dialysis
studies show essentially no recovery of CBS activity against two
different buffer systems; see Figure S13 and the surrounding
experimental details in the Supporting Information) and
consistently curtails CBS activity across three different assay
platforms − (i) cystathionine lyase and (ii) formation activities
(bidirectional transsulfuration) and (iii) H2S evolution. Given
the ability of this model inhibitor to effectively block CBS-
based evolution of H2S from L-cysteine in purified enzyme
assays, compound 6S was employed as a chemical biological
tool to manipulate H2S levels in both cell culture model
systems and in an animal stroke model.
These studies show promise for the ICV delivery of hCBS
inhibitors to neuronal tissue on several fronts. First, the efficacy
of the C2-symmetric hydrazone former, 6S, in competitively
inhibiting H2S formation in the cuvette is mirrored when
assaying its effect on H2S evolution in neuronal cell tissue
culture. Second, in SH-SY5Y cerebral neuronal cell model
studies employing OGD and high L-cysteine/L-homocysteine
concentrations to mimic stroke-like conditions, 6S is seen to
improve cell viability. Third, this protective effect of 6S in cell
culture translates into a protective effect against cerebral
infarction in a rat tMCAO model, over a 100 min occlusion
window. Infarction volume is reduced by over 80% upon ICV
pretreatment with 6S (at 1.6 μmol/kg) 30 min prestroke and
by nearly 70% when treatment is 1 h post-stroke. These
observations point to the utility of simple chemical biological
tools in projecting out toward an eventual therapeutic window
for an actual treatment. Finally, in separate experiments,
treatment with 6S is also seen to dampen the inflammatory
response associated with ischemia as measured by the up-
regulation of the macrophage and phagocyte-specific markers,
OX42 and ED1, respectively, in the tMCAO rat model and
their subsequent knockdown upon 6S treatment, in both the
cerebral cortex and striatum.
The principles articulated here with respect to CBS inhibitor
(i) structure (exploiting the pseudo-C2-symmetry inherent in
L,L-cystathionine), (ii) synthesis (demonstration of an efficient
“zipped synthesis” based upon versatile cross-metathesis
chemistry) and (iii) mechanism (exploiting the slow koff rate
associated with PLP-enzyme imine-hydrazone interchange−
t(1/2)off ≈ 2.5 h) will likely inform future efforts toward
enzyme inhibitor design, in general, and targeted efforts toward
blocking enzyme activity dependent upon pyridoxal phosphate,
in particular. Compound 6S, the first generation chemical
biological tool introduced here, though not highly potent,
represents a great improvement upon aminooxyacetic acid
(AOAA), the relatively nonspecific PLP enzyme inhibitor that
has been used in the closest previous studies. As a first pass
measure of specificity, GABA AT was used as a comparison
enzyme, as this is one of the best studied PLP-enzymes and one
of the most important PLP enzymes in the brain (controls
brain GABA levels). Whereas 6S is a 12-fold better inhibitor of
CBS (Ki ≈ 48 μM) than of GABA AT (IC(50) ≈ 572 μM),
AOAA is a 33-fold better inhibitor of GABA AT (IC(50) ≈ 360
nM) than of CBS (IC(50) ≈ 12 μM)54 (see Figure S17 in the
Supporting Information for details of the specificity assays).
Taken together these data show that 6S has a 400-fold
specificity advantage over AOAA for CBS inhibition as opposed
to GABA AT inhibition.
Of course, moving forward, it will be desirable to fine-tune
the inhibitor designs identified herein so as to expand and
refine the arsenal of chemical biological tools available for the
study of this important hCBS enzyme. Lead compound 6S
provides a useful starting point for such studies and sets the
stage for the development of second generation hCBS
inhibitors wherein issues of bioavailabilty, transport, metabo-
lism, and conformity to Lipinski’s rules of five56−58 may be
addressed. As was discussed at the outset, there is a major need
today to better define the temporal and spatial distribution of
H2S biogenesis and to better understand both the biological
roles of H2S and the molecular mechanisms by which these are
achieved. This study demonstrates the important role that small
molecule enzyme modulators are likely to play in addressing
these important questions in neuronal biology.
