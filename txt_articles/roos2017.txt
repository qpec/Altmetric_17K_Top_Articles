ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND There is a paucity of data on the association between high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) levels
and outcomes in patients with chest pain but no myocardial infarction (MI), or any other condition that may lead to
acutely elevated troponin levels.
OBJECTIVES The authors hypothesized that any detectable high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) level is
associated with adverse outcomes.
METHODS All patients (N ¼ 22,589) >25 years of age with chest pain and hs-cTnT analyzed concurrently in the emergency
department of Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden from 2011 to 2014 were eligible for inclusion. After
excluding all patients with acute conditions that may have affected hs-cTnT, or MI associated with the visit, or insufficient
information to determine whether troponin levels were stable, Cox regression was used to estimate risks for all-cause,
cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality, MI, and heart failure at different levels of troponins.
RESULTS A total of 19,460 patients with a mean age of 54 � 17 years were included. During a mean follow-up of
3.3 � 1.2 years, 1,349 (6.9%) patients died. Adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for all-cause mortality
were 2.00 (1.66 to 2.42), 2.92 (2.38 to 3.59), 4.07 (3.28 to 5.05), 6.77 (5.22 to 8.78), and 9.68 (7.18 to 13.00) in
patients with hs-cTnT levels of 5 to 9, 10 to 14, 15 to 29, 30 to 49, and $50 ng/l, respectively, compared with patients
with hs-cTnT levels <5 ng/l. There was a strong and graded association between all detectable levels of hs-cTnT and
risk for MI, heart failure, and cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality.
CONCLUSIONS Among patients with chest pain and stable troponin levels, any detectable level of hs-cTnT is associated with
an increased risk of death and cardiovascularoutcomes and should merit furtherattention. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;70:2226–36)

 disease (7–9), evidence is consistent that the newer
high-sensitivity assays retain prognostic value at
levels that were undetectable with the older assays
(10,11).
The increased sensitivity has been associated with
decreased specificity, causing a substantial propor-
tion of patients without MI to have hs-cTn levels
above the 99th percentile value, which is the cutoff
level for the diagnosis of MI (12,13). As for patients
with cardiac disease, troponin levels have been found
to be independent determinants and predictors of
adverse outcomes in patients with noncardiac acute
medical conditions (14). Investigation and treatment
of these patients are focused on the underlying con-
ditions
associated
with
elevated
hs-cTn
levels.
Persistently elevated hs-cTn levels without a typical
rise and/or fall pattern indicate chronic myocardial
injury. Knowledge on how to investigate or treat
these patients to prevent future adverse outcomes is
limited (15). Moreover, in patients with chest pain but
no MI, or any other condition that may affect troponin
levels acutely, few data are available on the associa-
tion between the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T
(hs-cTnT) level and long-term outcomes. Therefore,
we conducted a large observational cohort study
including all consecutive patients who sought medi-
cal attention for chest pain during a 4-year period at
our hospital to investigate the association between
stable hs-cTnT levels and long-term outcomes.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION. From January 1, 2011 through
October 20, 2014, we included all patients >25 years
of age with a principal report of chest pain and at least
1 hs-cTnT level analyzed in the ED at the Karolinska
University
Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Patients
with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
of <15 ml/min/1.73 m2, MI associated with the visit,
and any other acute medical condition that could be
related to an acute increase in the hs-cTnT level were
excluded (Figure 1).
The Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm
approved the study protocol. The study adhered to
the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki.
DATA SOURCES. We used our administrative data-
base, which includes all visits to the ED, to identify
patients
with
chest
pain.
Laboratory
data
were
retrieved from the hospital’s Department of Infor-
mation and Technology. The data were then sent to
the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare,
where information about comorbidities and outcomes
from
the
National
Patient
Register
(16),
medication use from the Prescribed Drug
Register, and dates and causes of death from
the Cause-of-Death register were retrieved.
The
creation
of
the
database
has
been
described previously (2). The Elecsys 2010
system
(Roche
Diagnostics,
Mannheim,
Germany)
was
used
to
analyze
hs-cTnT
levels. The assay has a limit of detection of
5
ng/l
and
a
limit
of
blank
of
3
ng/l.
The 99th percentile cutoff point is 14 ng/l,
and the coefficient of variation is <10% at
13 ng/l (4).
After excluding all patients with end-stage
kidney disease (n ¼ 131), and all patients with MI
associated with the visit (n ¼ 1,269), and all patients
with a first hs-cTnT level of #12 ng/l and a change in
the hs-cTnT level of >2 ng/l during the same visit as
suggested by the European Society of Cardiology
guidelines to identify patients at high risk for MI (1),
all patients with at least 1 hs-cTnT level of >14 ng/l
were identified (n¼4,052). To mimic clinical practice
all medical records of these patients were then scru-
tinized by 4 of the investigators with varied clinical
experience (A.R., M.J.H., N.B., and M.L.) to identify
and exclude all patients with a medical condition that
could potentially explain an elevated hs-cTnT level
(n ¼ 1,327), as well as those with insufficient infor-
mation to determine whether the hs-cTnT level was
stable (n ¼ 402). This process is described in detail in
the Online Appendix. The numbers of patients and
conditions associated with an acute elevation that led
to exclusion are shown in Figure 1 and Online Table 1.
Briefly, all available information in a patient’s
medical record regarding the index visit and other
visits, including laboratory data, radiology, echocar-
diography, noninvasive stress testing, vital signs, and
electrocardiography, was used to determine whether
the hs-cTnT level was affected by an acute condition.
For patients with at least 1 troponin level >14 ng/l, no
specific delta-troponin value was used that would
lead to exclusion of the patient. All patients with only
1 hs-cTnT level analyzed were excluded. The pro-
portions of agreement between the assessment of
A.R. and that of the other investigators were 0.90,
0.90, and 0.86, respectively, meaning that 90 of 100,
90 of 100, and 86 of 100 patients were assessed in the
same way by different investigators. Finally, 100 pa-
tients were randomly chosen from the final cohort,
and their medical records were scrutinized by 1 senior
cardiologist and 1 attending internist who were blin-
ded to the study protocol. These clinicians were asked
to assess whether the elevated hs-cTnT level found in
each patient was caused by an acute condition. Four

 patients were determined to have an acute condition
leading to a higher than usual hs-cTnT level, meaning
that 4% of patients were included in the stable
troponin cohort instead of being excluded because of
an acutely elevated troponin level.
EXPOSURE. Exposure was categorized according to
the following hs-cTnT levels: 5 to 9, 10 to 14, 15 to 29,
30 to 49, and $50 ng/l. Patients with an hs-cTnT
level <5 ng/l were used as references.
DEFINITIONS. The day the patient sought medical
attention for chest pain was defined as the index
date. Delta-troponin was defined as the largest dif-
ference between the first troponin level measured at
the index date and any other troponin level measured
during 24 h from the first level measured. Diabetes
was defined as ongoing medication with any hypo-
glycemic agent. In subgroup analyses, coronary artery
disease (CAD) was defined as prior MI or cardiac
revascularization, and established heart disease was
defined as prior CAD, heart failure, or atrial fibrilla-
tion.
Ongoing
medication
was
defined
as
$2
dispensed medications during the year preceding the
index date. eGFR was estimated using the Chronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation.
OUTCOMES AND FOLLOW-UP. Outcomes were retrieved
from the Patient Register by using only diagnoses in
the
primary
position.
Cardiovascular
death
was
defined as death caused by atherosclerotic disease (17).
Only the underlying cause of death was used, and this
information was retrieved from the Cause of Death
Register in which all deaths in Sweden are registered.
The end of follow-up for all-cause mortality was March
28, 2016, and then end of follow-up for all other out-
comes was December 31, 2014.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSES. Baseline
characteristics
are described as frequencies and percentages for
categorical variables and means and SDs for contin-
uous variables. Cox proportional hazards models
were used to calculate the association, expressed as
hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs), between the hs-cTnT level (<5 ng/l reference
group and 5 to 9, 10 to 14, 15 to 29, 30 to 49,
and $50 ng/l) and the following 5 outcomes: all-cause
mortality, cardiovascular death, noncardiovascular
death, MI, and hospitalization for heart failure. Two
models for each outcome were conducted (unad-
justed and adjusted) for the following covariates: age;
sex; eGFR; prior MI; heart failure; stroke; chronic

statins. Moreover, 2 sensitivity analysis were con-
ducted for the primary outcome of all-cause mortality
unadjusted and adjusted for the same confounders as
the main analysis: 1 where only patients with a delta-
troponin level of 0 to 2 ng/l were included; and a
second analysis where only patients with a change in
delta-troponin of <20% were included. We used the
Kaplan-Meier method to calculate the cumulative
incidence of all-cause mortality. Moreover, time was
introduced as an interaction term to account for the
increased sensitivity of the hs-cTnT assay after April
24, 2012 (18) by dividing the follow-up period into
2 periods: January 1, 2011 to April 24, 2012 and April
25, 2012 to October 20, 2014.
For subgroup analyses, we evaluated potential
effect modification by limiting our analyses to the
following subgroups: age, sex, eGFR (>60 and 15 to
60 ml/min/1.73 m2), heart failure, established heart
disease, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and time period.
The proportional hazard assumption was evaluated
by calculating the correlation between Schoenfeld
residuals for the covariates and the ranking of the
failure times. The correlations were close to zero,
and the p values were >0.05, which implies that
the assumption was met. Data management was
performed using the World Programming System,
version
3.1
(World
Programming
Ltd.,
Romsey,
Hampshire, United Kingdom). The software R, version
3.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria) was used for the statistical analyses.
RESULTS
STUDY POPULATION. In total, 19,460 patients were
included; of these patients, 62%, 21%, and 8.6% had
hs-cTnT levels of <5, 5 to 9, and 10 to 14 ng/l, respec-
tively (Table 1). A total of 7.9% of patients had hs-cTnT
levels >14 ng/l. With increasing hs-cTnT levels, the
patients were older, were more often men, had a lower
eGFR, and had more comorbidities. Overall 89% of the
study population had a delta-troponin level in the
range of 0 to 2 ng/l (Online Table 2). The mean delta-
troponin level was 1.4 � 11.7 ng/l in the whole study
population, with levels ranging from 0.23 � 2.7 ng/l and
1.3 � 8.1 ng/l in patients with baseline hs-cTnT levels
of <5 ng/l and 5 to 9 ng/l, respectively, and increasing
gradually to 9.8 � 19.4 ng/l in patients with baseline
hs-cTnT levels of $50 ng/l. The mean delta-troponin
level in 1,327 patients who were excluded from the
main analyses was 71 � 330 ng/l (Online Table 2).

 ALL-CAUSE, CARDIOVASCULAR, AND NONCARDIO-
VASCULAR MORTALITY. During a mean follow-up
of 3.3 � 1.2 years (65,196 person-years), 1,349 (6.9%)
patients
died
(Table
2).
The
crude
cumulative
mortality rate is shown in the Central Illustration.
The yearly rate of death was 0.5% among patients
with hs-cTnT levels <5 ng/l, and this rate rose in
a
graded
manner
with
increasing
levels
to
33%
among
patients
with
hs-cTnT
levels
$50
ng/l
(Table 2). The adjusted risk of death during follow-up
was doubled in patients with hs-cTnT levels of
5 to 9 ng/l, 3-fold higher in those with levels of
10 to 14 ng/l, and almost 10-fold higher in those
with levels $50 ng/l compared with patients with
hs-cTnT levels <5 ng/l.
In 2 sensitivity analyses we restricted the inclusion
of patients to those with (1) a delta-troponin level of
0 to 2 ng/l; and (2) a change in delta-troponin
of <20%. The associations were similar to those in
the main analysis (Online Table 3).
In total, 288 (1.5%) cardiovascular and 630 (3.2%)
noncardiovascular deaths occurred during a mean
2.1 � 1.1 years (41,760 person-years) of follow-up.

 of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality
increased in a graded manner with increasing hs-cTnT
levels. The adjusted risk for cardiovascular mortality
was more than 3-fold in patients with hs-cTnT levels of
5 to 9 ng/l, and it increased to 27 times in patients with
hs-cTnT levels $50 ng/l compared with patients with
hs-cTnT levels <5 ng/l. Similarly, the association be-
tween the hs-cTnT level and an increased risk for
noncardiovascular
mortality
was
significant,
but
weaker, for all detectable hs-cTnT levels (Table 2).
The 3 most common groups of causes of death were
as follows: cancer, with 325 deaths (35%); cardiovas-
cular disease, with 313 deaths (34%); and lung dis-
ease, with 53 (5.8%) deaths. This was followed by
39 (4.2%) deaths from gastrointestinal disease and
39 (4.2%) deaths from neurological disease. Eight of
the 10 most common specific causes of death were
cancer related in patients with hs-cTnT levels <5 ng/l,
and none were cardiovascular (Online Table 4). On
the contrary, in patients with hs-cTnT $50 ng/l only 2
among the 10 most common causes of death were
cancer
related,
and
4
were
cardiovascular.
The
10 most common causes of death in each stratum of
hs-cTnT are shown in Online Table 4.

A total of 304 (1.6%) MIs occurred during a mean 2.1 �
1.1 years of follow-up (Table 2). The yearly rate of MI
increased from 0.3% among patients with hs-cTnT
levels <5 ng/l to 4.5% in patients with hs-cTnT
levels $50 ng/l. The adjusted risk for MI during
follow-up was not increased among patients with
hs-cTnT levels of 5 to 9 ng/l but was doubled among
patients with hs-cTnT levels of 10 to 14 ng/l. A 2- to
3-fold increased risk for MI was found in patients with
hs-cTnT levels of 15 to 29, 30 to 49, and $50 ng/l.
In total, 488 (2.5%) cases of heart failure occurred
during a mean 2.1 � 1.1 years of follow-up. There was
a strong and graded increase in the yearly rate of
hospitalization for heart failure from 0.1% to 1.0% and
to 2.8% among patients with hs-cTnT levels of <5, 5 to

 9, and 10 to 14 ng/l, respectively, and to 20% among
patients with hs-cTnT levels $50 ng/l (Table 2). The
adjusted risk of hospitalization for heart failure dur-
ing follow-up was almost 4-fold higher among pa-
tients with hs-cTnT levels of 5 to 9 ng/l and 6-fold
higher among those with levels of 10 to 14 ng/l.
Patients with hs-cTnT levels >14 ng/l had an 11- to
13-fold increased adjusted risk of heart failure.
When time was added as an interaction term into
our statistical models to account for the fact that the
hs-cTnT assay became more sensitive after April 24,
2012 (18), the associations among different hs-cTnT
levels and death, MI, and heart failure were similar
(Online Table 5).

OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE ELEVATIONS
OF TROPONIN LEVELS. The 1,327 patients who were
excluded from the main analyses because of acute
illness that led to higher than usual troponin levels
were on an average 14 years older, and they were 3 to
4 times more likely to have comorbidities such as
chronic kidney disease, MI, heart failure, or atrial
fibrillation (Online Table 6). The yearly rates of all-
cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mor-
tality
were
11.2%,
4.5%,
and
8.7%,
respectively
(Online Table 7). Corresponding yearly rates for MI
and heart failure were 2.8% and 7.0%, respectively.
The 30-day mortality, MI, and heart failure rates were
3.9%, 1.7%, and 2.5%, respectively.
DISCUSSION
This observational cohort study of 19,460 patients who
sought medical attention for chest pain in the ED
revealed a strong and graded association between all
detectable levels of hs-cTnT and an increased risk of
death,
MI,
and
hospitalization
for
heart
failure.
An hs-cTnT level of 5 to 9 ng/l, which is well below the
99th percentile value of 14 ng/l, was associated
with a doubled risk of death after adjustment for
confounders.
Earlier studies involving community-based pop-
ulations revealed consistent and graded associations
between increasing hs-cTnT levels and the risk of
future cardiovascular events, even at levels below the
upper normal limit (19–21). Our results extend the
findings
from
previous
studies,
which
included
mainly healthy individuals, to a population including
patients with and without established cardiovascular
disease, patients with chronic kidney disease, men
and women, and patients with a wide range of ages.
The association between increasing hs-cTnT levels
and outcomes was similar in all subgroups of pa-
tients. In a recent study that evaluated an algorithm
to diagnose MI in patients with chest pain in the ED, it
was noted that patients with elevated hs-cTnT levels
in the absence of MI had a high risk for all-cause
mortality (22). In another study that included pa-
tients with chest pain to investigate negative predic-
tive values for MI by using a high-sensitivity cardiac
troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay, it was found that patients
with hs-cTnI levels <5 ng/l had a 59% lower risk of MI
or cardiac death compared with patients with values
between 5 ng/l and the 99th percentile value (23). In
these studies, patients without MI were not evaluated
for any acute condition that may have led to an
elevated troponin level. Therefore, we believe that
our study extends the findings from previous studies
in the respect that we evaluated all potential acute
elevations of troponin levels and excluded patients
not only with MI but also with any condition that
potentially could explain an elevated troponin level.
Observation of patients with chest pain is currently
focused on the exclusion of MI. In a recently pub-
lished paper, we found that patients with MI were
more than twice as likely to undergo echocardiogra-
phy than were patients with elevated hs-cTnT levels
and no MI, even though one-half of the patients with
elevated hs-cTnT levels and no MI had no history of
heart disease (13). In the current study, the yearly
mortality rate was 12% in patients with a persistent
hs-cTnT level of 15 to 29 ng/l. This finding corre-
sponds to the first-year mortality rate among 97,254
patients who survived an acute MI in Sweden from
2006 to 2011 (24).
The
current
clinical
guidelines
on
prevention
of
cardiovascular
disease
only
briefly
mention
persistently elevated troponins (1,17). Additionally,
no
consensus
has
been
reached
regarding
how
“chronically”
elevated
troponin
levels
should
be
defined. These guidelines lack advice on how to
investigate, follow-up, or treat patients with persis-
tently
elevated
troponin
levels.
Thus,
clinicians
currently have no guidance regarding how to handle
these patients even though our study and as other
studies indicate a similar or even higher risk of
premature death and cardiovascular outcomes than
in patients with MI (19–21).
We found a markedly increased risk of hospitaliza-
tion for heart failure with increasing hs-cTnT levels,
even at concentrations within the normal range. This
finding is consistent with data from animal models of
induced left ventricular dysfunction, as well as in
humans with heart failure, thus supporting contin-
uous and small release of troponin from the myocar-
dium (25). Another study showed that the risk of
incident heart failure was 6 times higher in patients
with hs-cTnT levels >14 ng/l than <14 ng/l (26).
The association between the hs-cTnT level and risk
of hospitalization for heart failure was stronger than
the association between the hs-cTnT level and MI.
This finding may reflect important differences in the
pathophysiological mechanisms of troponin release.
A reduced eGFR has been associated with moderate

 troponin elevations (27). Although renal clearance of
small troponin degradation products is the main
source of measured troponin (28), increased release
of troponin from the heart in the absence of necrosis
may also contribute to persistently elevated troponin
levels in many cases (29,30). However, the mecha-
nism behind release of troponin from viable car-
diomyocytes
is
unknown
(31).
Early
electron
microscopy studies suggested that transient holes
in the plasma membrane called “cell wounds” form
as a result of ischemia-induced swelling (32,33).
Several
other
mechanisms
have
been
suggested
such as myocyte necrosis, apoptosis, normal myocyte
turnover,
cellular
release
of
proteolytic
troponin
degradation products, and formation and release
of membranous blebs (34). Several different mecha-
nisms of troponin release may have been present
among our patients, and some mechanisms may
have been associated with worse prognosis than
others.
In a population-based cohort comprising mainly
healthy
individuals,
higher
hs-cTnT
levels
were
associated with increased left ventricular mass and
wall thickness, an increased likelihood of left ven-
tricular hypertrophy, and impaired left ventricular
systolic function (20). In contrast, studies do not
support an association between the hs-cTnT level and
either myocardial hyperenhancement on magnetic
resonance imaging as a marker of previous MI (35) or
the coronary artery calcium score (20). In patients
with stable CAD, the association between the hs-cTnT
level and the risks of all-cause mortality and heart
failure is stronger than that between the hs-cTnT
level and MI (36). Accordingly, chronic troponin
release may be mediated by functional and structural
heart diseases rather than by ischemic heart disease.
However, further investigation is needed regarding
what
adverse
processes
could
be
mediated
by
troponin leakage and whether the risk associated
with detectable troponin levels in stable patients is
modifiable.
In the absence of clinical guidelines, we strongly
believe that persistently elevated hs-cTnT levels may
be reason in itself to investigate patients for exclusion
of previously undiagnosed heart disease. In addition,
future research should focus on how to mitigate risk
for patients with no detectable heart disease that may
explain persistently elevated hs-cTnT levels.
STRENGTHS. The main strength of this study is that
it was conducted in the setting where troponin mea-
surement is most commonly performed, namely, in
patients with chest pain in the ED. Thus, we believe
that the external validity of our findings is high. The
large sample size allowed us to analyze data in a large
number of hs-cTnT categories and conduct appro-
priate
subgroup
analyses.
Furthermore,
we
used
validated national health care registers (16) with
complete coverage of Sweden. Thus, we had no loss
to follow-up, and all medications and comorbidities
resulting in hospitalization were known to us.
Unlike some other studies that relied only on
1 hs-cTnT level to categorize patients (19–21), we used
all levels available to us and never included patients
with an elevated level on only a single measurement.
We were able to exclude patients with acute medical
conditions that may have led to high hs-cTnT levels.
We observed high interobserver agreement in the
assessment of whether the hs-cTnT level was affected
by acute illness. In addition, when it was not possible
to determine the presence of an acute or persistent
elevation of the hs-cTnT level, those patients were
excluded from the study. Moreover, only 4% of a
random sample from the final cohort, which was
assessed by 2 physicians not involved in the study,
was determined to have acutely elevated hs-cTnT
levels.
Therefore,
we
believe
that
the
risk
of
misclassification in terms of exposure was small.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. The main limitation of our
study is that we were not able to enroll patients pro-
spectively on the basis of repeated measurements of
the hs-cTnT level. Thus, although we believe that a
selection bias that leads to 4% of patients being mis-
classified as exposed is rather small, a preferred
strategy would have been to analyze hs-cTnT levels 1
to 2 weeks after the index visit. An alternative strategy
for scrutinizing medical records to decide whether
troponin levels were stable would have been to pre-
define a delta-troponin level that would have led to
exclusion. However, because we wanted to mimic real-
world conditions we chose to use all the information
available to us in the medical records. Moreover, if
patients with medical conditions related to an acute
hs-cTnT elevation arrive late to the ED, their troponin
levels may have plateaued. Consequently, even if
delta-troponin levels were analyzed 12 to 24 h apart,
patients with only minimal changes may have been
considered to have falsely stable levels. In addition, if
we had restricted our study population to a very nar-
row delta-troponin level, it would have led to a smaller
study population and significantly reduced precision
in our estimates. Although 89% of patients had delta-
troponin levels between 0 and 2 ng/l, there were pa-
tients with rather large variability in hs-cTnT levels
who were not excluded because we had no rule for
excluding patients on the basis of absolute changes in
hs-cTnT levels. With higher baseline hs-cTnT levels

 the variability became more pronounced, as expected,
and as described previously in completely stable
patients with elevated baseline troponin levels (37).
However, in 2 sensitivity analyses where we restricted
the included patients to those who had a delta-
troponin level of 0 to 2 ng/l and <20% change in
troponin levels, we found similar point estimates for
the risk of all-cause mortality as in the main analysis.
Therefore, we believe that our findings may be used in
a clinical context because the basis of the process of
determining whether patients had stable hs-cTnT
levels was information available in clinical practice.
There may have been differences in the proportion of
MI type 1 or 2 cases during follow-up in different
categories of hs-cTnT levels. However, because there
was no code for subtypes of MI in the Swedish version
of the International Classification of Diseases-Tenth
Revision, we were not able to investigate whether
there were any differences among the groups. We did
not have information on left ventricular hypertrophy
or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, both of
which were associated with elevated troponin levels
previously (20). Finally, as in every observational
cohort study, we cannot exclude that there was
residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS
In a large cohort of patients with chest pain without
MI or other conditions that may have affected the
hs-cTnT level, we found that an hs-cTnT level of 5 to
9 ng/l was associated with a 2-fold higher risk of long-
term mortality. The risk of death and all cardiovas-
cular outcomes increased in a graded manner with
increasing hs-cTnT levels, starting at levels well
below the normal upper limit. Our data indicate that
any detectable hs-cTnT level is associated with an
increased risk of death and cardiovascular events and
may merit further attention.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In patients
presenting to the emergency department with chest pain, even
slightly elevated blood levels of hs-cTnT are associated with
adverse clinical outcomes.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: More information is needed
to define optimum evaluation and management strategies for
patients with elevated hs-cTnT levels and the interventions that
reduce the risk of adverse events.
