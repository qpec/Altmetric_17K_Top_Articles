Abstract
We assess how presymptomatic infection affects predictability of infectious disease epi-
demics. We focus on whether or not a major outbreak (i.e. an epidemic that will go on to
infect a large number of individuals) can be predicted reliably soon after initial cases of dis-
ease have appeared within a population. For emerging epidemics, significant time and effort
is spent recording symptomatic cases. Scientific attention has often focused on improving
statistical methodologies to estimate disease transmission parameters from these data.
Here we show that, even if symptomatic cases are recorded perfectly, and disease spread
parameters are estimated exactly, it is impossible to estimate the probability of a major out-
break without ambiguity. Our results therefore provide an upper bound on the accuracy of
forecasts of major outbreaks that are constructed using data on symptomatic cases alone.
Accurate prediction of whether or not an epidemic will occur requires records of symptom-
atic individuals to be supplemented with data concerning the true infection status of appar-
ently uninfected individuals. To forecast likely future behavior in the earliest stages of an
emerging outbreak, it is therefore vital to develop and deploy accurate diagnostic tests that
can determine whether asymptomatic individuals are actually uninfected, or instead are
infected but just do not yet show detectable symptoms.
Author Summary
Emerging epidemics pose a significant challenge to human health worldwide. Accurate
real-time forecasts of whether or not initial reports will be followed by a major outbreak
are necessary for efficient deployment of control. For all infectious diseases, there is a
delay between infection and the appearance of symptoms, i.e. an initial period following
first infection during which infected individuals remain presymptomatic. We use mathe-
matical modeling to evaluate the effect of presymptomatic infection on predictions of

 major epidemics. Our results show rigorously, for the first time, that precise estimates of
the current number of infected individuals—and consequently the chance of a major out-
break in future—cannot be inferred from data on symptomatic cases alone. This is the
case even if the values of epidemiological parameters, such as the average infection and
death or recovery rates of individuals in the population, can be estimated accurately. Accu-
rate prediction is in fact impossible without additional data from which the number of cur-
rently infected but as yet presymptomatic individuals can be deduced.
Introduction
A principal challenge in infectious disease epidemiology is quantifying the threat posed by dis-
ease early in emerging outbreaks [1,2]. During the earliest stages of infectious disease out-
breaks, two main questions are i) will a major epidemic occur, and ii) what will the final size of
the outbreak be [3]? Answering the second of these questions is impossible without under-
standing the answer to the first. We therefore focus on predicting whether or not reports of ini-
tial cases will be followed by a major outbreak of disease, in which a large number of
individuals become infected [4–7]. Accurate real-time forecasts at the start of emerging out-
breaks are essential for efficient deployment of limited resources for control [8,9]. However,
the dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks are influenced by the incubation period, within
which hosts are infected but do not yet show symptoms [10–12]. We use mathematical model-
ing to investigate how the consequent ambiguity in the number of hosts that are currently
infected confounds prediction in the earliest stages of a potential major outbreak.
The basic reproductive number, R0, the average number of secondary cases caused by a sin-
gle infection in a totally susceptible population, justifiably dominates any discussion of infec-
tious disease epidemiology [4,5,13]. If R0 < 1, there will certainly not be a major outbreak [14].
When R0 is above this threshold, however, major outbreaks can but do not always occur
[15,16]. In large populations, the distribution of epidemic sizes is bimodal when R0 > 1, and
either the disease dies out with very few ever becoming infected, or it becomes widespread [5,7]
(S1 Fig). A major outbreak can therefore naturally be defined as one where the disease becomes
widespread, i.e. the total number of hosts that ever become infected lies in the part of the distri-
bution of possible final sizes that contains the larger mode. A well-known approximation to
the probability of a major outbreak in a large population can be derived from simple stochastic
epidemiological models,
ProbðMajor outbreakÞ � 1 �
1
R0
�
�I�
;
where I� is the number that are infected at the time of estimation [6]. This estimate is wide-
spread in the theoretical epidemiology literature particularly in the case where disease first arri-
ves in the system and so I� = 1 [5,15,17–22]. We note that this formula has also been used in
the context of the spread of the recent Ebola outbreak to Nigeria, to estimate the chance that a
single undetected infected case will spark a major outbreak [23]. More sophisticated approxi-
mations to the probability of a major outbreak can be derived for models containing additional
epidemiological detail, for example population structure [24,25], more refined models of indi-
viduals’ infectious periods [6], and differences in infectivity between individuals [13]. Crucially,
however, the approximation above illustrates that estimates of the probability of a major out-
break require knowledge not only of the values of disease transmission parameters, but also of
the total number of currently infected hosts, I�. This includes those individuals that have not

 yet developed symptoms. Modelers have concentrated on developing increasingly elaborate
statistical machinery to estimate the parameters that constitute R0 [26–28]. Other work, most
notably back-calculation [29,30], focuses on estimating the number of individuals that are cur-
rently infected, accounting for delays before symptoms emerge. What has never been exam-
ined, however, is how the lack of knowledge of precisely how many are infected in the early
stages of a potential major outbreak affects predictability of whether or not a large epidemic
will in fact go on to occur. In practice, epidemic forecasts for specific pathogens are typically
conducted via simulation [11,31–36]. Consequently, we conduct a simulation-based study into
the impact of presymptomatic infection—which the formula from the theoretical epidemiology
literature suggests might disrupt forecasting—on predictions of major epidemics.
Case study: Ebola virus disease
As an example of a disease for which initial cases are frequently not followed by major out-
breaks, and with a significant delay between infection and emergence of symptoms, we con-
sider Ebola virus disease. All five strains of the genus Ebolavirus cause severe acute illness, with
early non-specific symptoms including asthenia and myalgia typically followed by nausea,
vomiting, hemorrhagic symptoms and, in a significant proportion of cases, death [37]. There
are reports of cases of Ebola in remote villages in Central and West Africa every few years [38],
hypothesized to be initiated by spillover from reservoirs of infection in wild animal popula-
tions, with fruit bats most often implicated as the reservoir host [39]. Often there is no sus-
tained human-to-human transmission, and initial cases do not lead to large outbreaks.
However, since 1976 there have been twenty-five distinct reports of primary infection in
humans, of which sixteen have led to epidemics causing more than twenty deaths. The largest
ever Ebola outbreak started in Guinea in December 2013 and subsequently spread to and
caused widespread transmission in Liberia and Sierra Leone, with additional cases in Nigeria,
Mali, Senegal, Spain, USA, UK and Italy. This epidemic caused more than 11,000 fatalities
before it was declared officially over by the World Health Organization on 14th January 2016,
although an additional death was confirmed the following day and additional small flare-ups
are still possible [40].
Modeling studies of Ebola have tended to focus on parameter estimation [41–43] and the
potential effects of disease control [31,32,37,44]. Here, we instead focus on using an existing
epidemiological model fitted to data from the outbreak in Uganda that killed 224 people in
2000 [45] to show how presymptomatic infection affects our ability to predict whether or not
reports of initial cases will go on to cause a major outbreak. Ebola is therefore a motivating
example for our investigation into how presymptomatic infection affects the predictability of
infectious disease epidemics. However, since presymptomatic infection is ubiquitous, our con-
clusions are applicable to a wide range of pathogens.
Results
Estimating the probability of a major outbreak
We use simulations of stochastic compartmental epidemic models to drive our analyses. The
models assume that, at any time, every member of the population belongs to a compartment
describing their infection and symptom status. In a single realization of the model, whether or
not an individual becomes infected is a random process. If an individual does become infected,
then the model generates the time at which the individual is first infected, the time at which
symptoms first appear and the time at which the individual either dies or recovers. These times
are simply those at which the individual passes into the relevant compartments of the model.

 We therefore produce a “dataset” for the start of an outbreak by running a simulation
model. We “freeze” the outbreak at the time of the fourth death, and calculate two quantities
using the model (Fig 1): the probability of a major outbreak given complete observation of pre-
symptomatic cases (hereafter referred to as the “true” probability of a major outbreak), and the
estimate of this probability that only uses data on the timings of symptoms and deaths and not
the times at which individuals are initially infected. In this estimated probability, the presymp-
tomatic cases remain hidden and the number of presymptomatic infected individuals is esti-
mated from the data on symptoms and deaths.
Fig 1. Incorrect estimation of the probability of a major outbreak. The number of presymptomatic infected individuals is estimated (giving a distribution of
possible values), and these values are used as initial conditions in forward simulations to build a point estimate of the probability of a major outbreak (bottom
left—here, the estimated probability of a major outbreak is 0.55). However, the number of presymptomatic infected individuals actually takes a single value,
which can be used in forward simulations to determine the true probability of a major outbreak (bottom right—here, the true probability of a major outbreak is
0.78). The underlying dataset is simulated using the SEIR model, and the predicted future behaviors shown are generated using 100,000 forward simulations
of the model.

 For an individual outbreak, a confidence interval can be constructed around the point esti-
mate that we consider. For the outbreak in Fig 1, the distributional estimate of the number of
exposed individuals leads to a 95% confidence interval for the current number of infected indi-
viduals of [1,6], which corresponds to an extremely wide 95% confidence interval for the prob-
ability of a major outbreak of [0.24,0.78]. The point estimate corresponds to a weighted sum
over the distributional estimate of the probability of a major outbreak.
Our initial analysis considers a simplified, SEIR model with exponential waiting times in
each compartment. In the SEIR model, presymptomatic infecteds are confined to the uninfec-
tious, latently infected (E) class. We relax this assumption later, and also consider the case
where the waiting times follow gamma, rather than exponential distributions. Recent modeling
work, focused on the recent outbreak of Ebola, often includes considerable epidemiological
detail [31,32,44], although there are some exceptions [42,43,46]. Here we take advantage of a
previous parameterization of the SEIR model for Ebola, noting that the SEIR model is widely-
used for a number of diseases and captures what we want to investigate here—i.e. the effect of
presymptomatic infection on major outbreak forecasting—in the simplest possible way.
The true and estimated probabilities of a major epidemic are calculated for many simulated
outbreaks, to investigate how presymptomatic infection affects the ability to predict major epi-
demics early in outbreaks (Fig 2A). The probability of a major outbreak depends on the num-
ber of infected individuals at the time of estimation (S2 Fig), and hidden presymptomatic
infection therefore frustrates prediction. This is even the case when there are actually no

outbreak, what point estimate for the estimated probability of a major outbreak might be obtained? (100,000 simulated datasets using the SEIR model for
each true probability). For clarity, true probabilities greater than 0.97 are classified into bins of size 0.01. B. How does the true probability of a major outbreak
vary between outbreaks with the same point estimate for the probability of a major outbreak? Estimated probabilities are classified into bins of size 0.1
(100,000 simulated datasets per bin). Circle areas are proportional to the number of outbreaks at each true probability, normalized for each bin of estimated
probabilities of a major outbreak, so that the sum of the areas of the circles along each horizontal line is constant.

 presymptomatic infected individuals in the population, since the distribution that estimates the
number of presymptomatic individuals will include values other than zero.
In the SEIR model, only discrete values of the true probability of a major outbreak are possi-
ble, since the true probability is entirely controlled by the total number of infected individuals
at the time of estimation. However, each individual dataset, corresponding to a separate reali-
zation of an outbreak, consists of the times that individuals become symptomatic. Slight varia-
tions in these times lead to different probability distributions of the number of presymptomatic
infecteds. These differences are reflected in the estimated probability of a major outbreak. Con-
sequently, the estimated probability for each true value is effectively a continuously varying
quantity.
The key qualitative result, i.e. that the estimated and true probabilities of a major outbreak
do not match, is robust to performing estimation at different stages of the start of an outbreak,
and to different lengths of the incubation period and values of R0 (S3–S6 Figs). Additional
uncertainty in the probability of a major outbreak occurs when the parameters for disease
spread must also be estimated from the transmission data (S7 Fig). However, no matter how
much parameter estimation is improved, for example using data from previous outbreaks to
inform estimates, presymptomatic infection still causes significant errors in forecasting major
outbreaks.
The problem of practical interest for an emerging epidemic is inferring the true probability
of a major outbreak. For an individual outbreak, a (often imprecise) confidence interval can be
constructed around the point estimate as we described above. However, we characterize the
implications of presymptomatic infection more generally by examining many simulated out-
breaks, inverting our point estimate of the probability of a major outbreak to consider the
range of true probabilities that are possible for each estimated value. Similar estimated proba-
bilities of a major outbreak can correspond to a remarkably wide range of true probabilities
(Fig 2B). For example, for outbreaks in which the estimated probability is between 0.5 and 0.6,
the true probability can lie between 0.23 and 0.83. We note the extreme values are themselves
quite likely: in 13% of these simulated outbreaks, the true probability is in fact either 0.23 or
0.83.
Improving estimates using diagnostic tests
Estimation of the chance of a major outbreak can be improved by the use of diagnostic tests to
determine whether asymptomatic individuals are susceptible or presymptomatic infected.
Since the reliability of diagnostic tests affects the extent to which forecasting is improved (Fig
3), it is not only important to develop diagnostic tests but also to ensure their continued refine-
ment. To illustrate the general principle that diagnostic tests could be used to improve predic-
tion, we simply choose individuals to test at random from the asymptomatic individuals in the
population. With random selection, the diagnostic test must be deployed widely to reduce the
error in estimates significantly, although of course careful choice of which individuals to test
(e.g. via contact tracing) would reduce the need for such widespread deployment in practice.
Different assumptions about the incubation and latent periods
The emergence of symptoms and the emergence of infectivity are assumed to coincide in the
SEIR model. We relax this assumption by considering two other models. In the first, individu-
als display symptoms before becoming infectious (Fig 4A). In the second, individuals are infec-
tious before becoming symptomatic (Fig 4B). When symptoms appear before individuals are
infectious, the incubation period is reduced, so more infected individuals can be detected. As a
result, predictions of major outbreaks become more accurate, although some systematic

 ambiguity nevertheless remains (Figs 4A and S8A). Conversely, if the incubation period is
instead longer than the latent period, as is the case for many human diseases [47], it becomes
more difficult to predict major outbreaks accurately (Figs 4B and S8B).
In Fig 4B, the variable heights of adjacent boxplots indicate that the distribution of infected
individuals between the asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious classes affects the estimated
probability of a major outbreak. For example, the heights of the second and third boxplots
from the left can be explained as follows. Consider two outbreaks, each with only a single
infected individual at the time that the chance of a major outbreak is being estimated. Suppose
that in the first outbreak (“outbreak one”, say), the infected individual is presymptomatic, but
in the second outbreak (“outbreak two”) the infected individual is symptomatic. In outbreak
two, because disease is observed since the infected individual is symptomatic, the estimated
probability of a major outbreak will be high compared to outbreak one. However, whilst the
estimated probability of a major outbreak is higher for outbreak two, the true probability of a
major outbreak is in fact higher for outbreak one. This is because, in Fig 4B, individuals can be
infectious both when they are presymptomatic and when they are symptomatic. A presymp-
tomatic individual is therefore likely to be infectious for a longer period in future than a symp-
tomatic individual. A longer time infectious corresponds to (on average) more infections, and
therefore a higher true probability of a major outbreak.

 It might also naïvely be thought that prediction would be easiest in outbreaks in which
many infected individuals are symptomatic. However, when a large proportion of infected
individuals are symptomatic, the total number of infected individuals tends to be overesti-
mated, causing large errors in forecasts (cf. the boxplots corresponding to a single infected indi-
vidual at the time of estimation in Fig 4B).
The default assumption for compartmental models is that incubation and infectious periods
are exponentially distributed. We relax this assumption, and draw periods instead from two-
parameter gamma distributions to reflect the observed incubation and infectious periods for a
number of diseases [49,50] (S9 Fig). Recently-infected individuals are more likely to remain
infectious for a long period beyond the time of estimation than individuals that have already
been infected for a long time. Consequently, outbreaks with many presymptomatic infecteds
have a high true probability of a major outbreak. However, because presymptomatic individu-
als are unobserved, the estimated probability of a major outbreak is low in these outbreaks.
Discussion
Predicting whether or not a major epidemic is likely, from the limited data typically available
during the first few days of an outbreak, has received surprisingly little attention. A notable
exception is the paper by Drake [51], which shows that the exact final size varies significantly
between simulated outbreaks under identical conditions. He investigates how this variability
scales with the contact rate between individuals and the efficacy and speed of control responses.

Carlo [48]. In the boxplots in A, for clarity, true probabilities greater than 0.98 are classified into bins of size 0.01, and in B, true probabilities greater than 0.8
are classified into bins of size 0.01.

 However an incubation period is not explicitly included in the model used. Craft et al. [7] use a
model of rabies in canids to show that the first four death times cannot be used to forecast
major outbreaks. However, by assuming that the data consist of death times alone, the factors
potentially responsible for this imprecision are confounded. Neither Drake [51] nor Craft et al.
[7] quantify the error caused by presymptomatic infection. In addition to quantifying this
error, our main message is that presymptomatic infection by itself is sufficient to cause error in
predictions of whether or not an outbreak will be major, let alone in predicting the final size
exactly. This error is particularly notable when there are no infected individuals in the popula-
tion at all (i.e. the outbreak has already faded out), since the distribution that estimates the
number of presymptomatic infected individuals will include values other than zero.
To focus entirely on the uncertainty caused by presymptomatic infection, we worked in an
idealized setting in which symptomatic cases and deaths were recorded perfectly and in which
the values of disease transmission parameters were known exactly. This allowed us to calculate
the exact probability distribution of the current size of the outbreak, i.e. the total number of
individuals currently infected, given that presymptomatic infection causes some infected indi-
viduals to be unobservable. This distribution drives the estimated probability of a major
outbreak.
In practice, however, the distribution of possible current outbreak sizes would have to be
estimated from incomplete data on symptomatic cases and deaths, without exact knowledge of
parameter values and sometimes without even knowing the total population size precisely. One
method for doing this is back-calculation, as originally designed by Brookmeyer and Gail for
HIV-AIDS [29], which provides an estimate for the distribution of possible current outbreak
sizes. Although, to the best of our knowledge, back-calculation has not been used to estimate
the probability of a major outbreak, such a forecast using back-calculation as an input would
necessarily be less precise than those used in our analyses here, since we have used the exact
distribution of current outbreak sizes given presymptomatic infection. Indeed, by restricting
our attention to the case in which there are sufficient data that the number of presymptomatic
individuals is the only quantity being estimated, our results provide an upper bound on the
ability of any method that seeks to predict major outbreaks from data on symptomatic cases
alone. In fact, given the extensive knowledge of the epidemic assumed here, the basic formula-
tion of back-calculation can be extended in a natural fashion to obtain the exact probability dis-
tribution of the current size of the outbreak that we use to generate our estimates for the
probability of a major outbreak (S4 Text, S10 Fig).
Prediction during the recent Ebola outbreak has been criticized for overestimating the total
number of cases that actually occurred [52]. Similarly, modeling studies during the 2009 H1N1
outbreak typically overestimated the total number of cases [53]. In contrast with investigations
that attempt to predict the final epidemic size, we differentiated only between “minor” and
“major” outbreaks. Our focus was prediction during the very early stages of an outbreak, before
a major outbreak is underway, rather than forecasting the final extent of a major outbreak once
the epidemic has taken off. This very initial phase of outbreaks is particularly important given
the recent interest in rapid detection of disease outbreaks [54–57].
We assumed that the parameter values controlling disease spread are unchanged through-
out the early stage of the outbreak, whereas in reality these parameters might vary temporally
in response to changing contact networks and control interventions [58], as well as varying
environmental conditions [59]. However, any such variations will only exacerbate the uncer-
tainty that we have shown exists. Other sources of uncertainty such as under-reporting, which
has posed a challenge to forecasting during the recent Ebola outbreak [60], will also decrease
predictability further, although as we have shown presymptomatic infection alone is sufficient
to make precise prediction impossible. A systematic investigation of the errors in forecasting

 caused by under-reporting in comparison to those due to other features such as presymptom-
atic infection or epidemiological parameter uncertainty is a possibility for a future study.
Our work shows rigorously, for the first time, that no matter how accurately disease trans-
mission parameters are estimated, precise estimates early in outbreaks of whether a major epi-
demic will occur will remain unavailable without data about presymptomatic infection. This is
still the case even if significant resources are devoted to recording symptomatic cases accu-
rately. Consequently, diagnostic tests that can identify presymptomatic infecteds [61,62] are
extremely important for improving forecasts of epidemic outbreaks. While our simulations
consider random testing of asymptomatic individuals, in practice testing is costly [63], so it is
vital that predictability is further improved in a cost-effective way by careful selection of indi-
viduals to test. This could be done by contact tracing [64] or using statistical methods to iden-
tify individuals with the highest risk of being infected [65], although of course effective and
cheap diagnostics are still required. A systematic investigation into which asymptomatic indi-
viduals ought to be tested, accounting for the specificity of the tests as well as the sensitivity,
would be a valuable extension to our work. A recent analysis of Ebola [66] has considered test-
ing of individuals already exhibiting symptoms to confirm whether the patients have Ebola or
a different disease with similar symptoms. That study shows that using rapid diagnostic tests in
combination with slower but more accurate diagnostic tests could have significantly reduced
the number of cases in Sierra Leone in the recent outbreak.
Our conclusions are robust to various characteristics of the disease, and so apply to all infec-
tious diseases. We chose to use Ebola as a representative case study, but our results are in fact
generic. In particular, our key message that presymptomatic infection drives uncertainty in
whether an emerging outbreak will become major holds throughout the early stages of the out-
break (S3 and S4 Figs), as well for a number of values of the basic reproduction number of the
pathogen (S6 Fig). For Ebola, there is debate as to whether the onset of symptoms and infec-
tiousness coincide [67] or not [68]. However, symptoms and infectiousness are certainly not
always concurrent: HIV is a high profile example, for which the time between infection and
recognizable symptoms can take years [69], whereas individuals are infectious within months
of acquiring the virus [70]. We have considered different models in which symptoms and infec-
tiousness are not assumed to coincide (Figs 4 and S8). While we showed prediction is most reli-
able for diseases for which the incubation period is shorter than the latent period, even very
short incubation periods can generate significant uncertainty in the number of presymptomatic
infecteds, and therefore the probability of a major outbreak (S5 Fig). This means that our con-
clusions even hold for diseases such as influenza and norovirus, which have incubation periods
of only a few days [4]. The messages we have set out are also robust to different distributions of
the incubation and infectious periods, as we showed by considering models for which these
periods follow gamma rather than exponential distributions (S9 Fig).
Of course, our conclusions are relevant to pathogens of agricultural and wild animals and
plants, as well as humans. Xylella fastidiosa is a plant pathogen that is currently invading south-
ern Italy, causing devastating damage to olive groves [71]. Containment and surveillance zones
have been set up in an attempt to find the pathogen and subsequently mitigate spread via con-
trol interventions. Surveys in the containment zone do include some laboratory testing for pre-
symptomatic infection, with the surveillance zone solely relying on diagnosis from visual
inspection [72]. We have shown that consideration of presymptomatic infection is extremely
important when forecasting the spread of pathogens, and so it is also likely to be important
when planning interventions that attempt to slow or prevent spread. Studies examining the
impacts of presymptomatic infection on forecasting and control of specific pathogens would
represent valuable applied extensions to this publication.

 At the time of writing, a point-of-care diagnostic test that can detect Ebola from blood sam-
ples has been developed and found to be accurate [73]. In light of our analysis, the continued
development, deployment and improvement of this and other diagnostic tests that determine
whether asymptomatic individuals are infected is of obvious public health importance, not
only for Ebola but also for other infectious diseases.
Methods
Mathematical models
We perform our analyses using stochastic compartmental models of disease spreading in a
small population. Here we outline the three types of model we use: the standard SEIR model,
which assumes that symptoms and infectiousness coincide; more complex models that relax
this assumption; and a model that assumes that the incubation and infectious periods follow
gamma, rather than exponential, distributions.
Equal incubation and latent periods (SEIR model).
For simplicity we use a SEIR model
initially, making the commonly-used assumption that the emergence of symptoms and of
infectivity coincide exactly [41,45,74]. The classic deterministic SEIR model has the following
form [5]:
dS
dt ¼ �bSI;
dE
dt ¼ bSI � gE;
dI
dt ¼ gE � mI;
dR
dt ¼ mI:
Here, S is the number of individuals susceptible to the pathogen, E the number latently and
presymptomatically infected, I the number of symptomatic infectious individuals, and R the
number of dead or recovered individuals. We conduct our analysis starting from one initial
presymptomatic infected (with the rest of the population of size 1,000 susceptible), using the
analogous stochastic model, and generate simulations using the Gillespie direct method [75].
The model is parameterized for Ebola [45]: β = 3.83 × 10−4 days−1, 1/γ = 3.35 days and 1/μ =
3.5 days (so that R0 � 1.34). However, we also test the robustness of our results to these choices.
The World Health Organization states that the incubation period is usually between 2 and 21
days [76]. The mean value from the fitted model we have used is at the lower end of this inter-
val and therefore provides a particularly stringent test of the possible effects of presymptomatic
infection on forecasting major outbreaks of disease.
Unequal incubation and latent periods (SEUIR and SEAIR models).
The SEIR model
assumes that the incubation and latent periods coincide exactly, so that individuals in the I
class are both infectious and symptomatic. For Ebola, there is debate as to whether the onset of
symptoms and infectiousness coincide [67] or not [68]; however models usually assume that
they do [32,37,44]. This assumption is certainly untrue for numerous other diseases [4]. We
therefore also consider models in which the incubation and latent periods are unequal, thereby
allowing for asymptomatic infectious or symptomatic uninfectious individuals. To examine the
case where symptoms appear before infectiousness, we use the stochastic SEUIR model, in
which individuals in the U (i.e. Uninfectious symptomatic) class are symptomatic but not yet
infectious. To illustrate the effects of this extra compartment, we make the representative

 choice that the average time spent in the E class in the SEIR model case is now split between
1/γ1 = 2.35 days in the E class and 1/γ2 = 1 day in the U class. To consider potential effects of
individuals becoming infectious before symptoms appear, we use the stochastic SEAIR model,
in which individuals in the A (i.e. Asymptomatic infectious) class are asymptomatic but infec-
tious. In this case, we assume that the average time spent in the equivalent of the I class in the
SEIR model is now split between 1/μ1 = 1 day in the A class and 1/μ2 = 2.5 days in the I class.
Gamma-distributed incubation and infectious periods.
We consider a model that uses
the so-called “method of stages” [6,77] to replace exponential distributions for the incubation
and infectious periods with gamma distributions, by replacing the E and I classes in the SEIR
model with three E and I classes (each with period one third of the respective original class).
Gamma distributions are more realistic for a number of infectious diseases [49,50], and have
been found to fit incubation period and time from symptom onset to death data from the
recent Ebola outbreak [67].
Estimating the number of presymptomatic infected individuals
Since our concern is quantifying uncertainty caused by presymptomatic infection alone, we
assume that the parameters controlling disease transmission are known, and that complete
data are available from the very beginning of the epidemic for changes in the number of symp-
tomatic infected individuals over time. These data can be used to construct the probability dis-
tribution for the number of presymptomatic infected individuals at the time of estimation (S1
Text). For the SEIR model, the data on symptomatic cases are used to estimate the probability
that an asymptomatic individual is infected, which feeds into a binomial distribution to esti-
mate the number of presymptomatic infected individuals. The approach can readily be adapted
for the SEUIR and gamma-distributed incubation and infectious periods cases. In the SEAIR
model case, the A class causes the complete time series of infectious individuals to be unob-
served, so that the required probability cannot be calculated. Instead reversible jump Markov
chain Monte Carlo (S2 Text) is used to estimate the probability distribution for the number of
currently infected individuals.
Testing to detect presymptomatic infection
To illustrate the principle that diagnostic tests can improve forecasts, the sampling of asymp-
tomatic individuals and testing to find presymptomatic infection is modeled by choosing indi-
viduals at random out of the S or E classes without replacement. If the individual is susceptible,
then infection is not detected (i.e. the test produces no false positives), whereas if the individual
is presymptomatic infected, the pathogen is detected with probability pd. The results of the
sample can then be integrated into the estimate of the probability distribution of the number of
presymptomatic infected individuals, which therefore becomes more precise (S3 Text).
The true and estimated probability of a major outbreak
We estimate two probabilities using data from individual simulated epidemics at the time of
the fourth death: the true probability of a major outbreak, and the best point estimate of this
probability consistent with the transmission data. Specifically, we calculate the true probability
of an outbreak by “freezing” the infection status of all individuals at the time of four deaths,
simulating a very large number of outbreaks (100,000) using these data as initial conditions,
and finding the proportion of simulations in which a major outbreak occurs (defined as more
than 10% of the population ever becoming infected, cf. S1 Fig). Of course, this calculation is
only possible since the number of presymptomatic infected individuals is known.

 To calculate the estimated probability of a major outbreak, we instead imagine that the
exact infection statuses of individuals that are asymptomatic (i.e. susceptible individuals and
presymptomatic infected individuals) are unknown, as would be the case in practice. We use
the data on symptomatic cases up to the time of the fourth death to infer the probability distri-
bution of the number of presymptomatic infecteds. We then calculate the estimated probability
of a major outbreak by running an ensemble of simulations that sample initial conditions from
this distribution on each forward run.

S5 Fig. Robustness of results to different ratios of incubation to infectious period. For
extremely short incubation periods, the probability of a major outbreak can be estimated more
accurately (since variation in the number of presymptomatic infected individuals between sim-
ulations is lower). Here, the infectious period is held fixed and the incubation period varied so
that the ratio of these is consistent with poliomyelitis (ratio = 0.12), influenza (ratio = 0.8),
mumps (ratio = 2.5) and diphtheria (ratio = 5) [4]. True probabilities greater than 0.97 are clas-
sified into bins of size 0.01.

tion, and constrained to within x% of the true value (representing prior knowledge about the

identified, is calculated from 10,000 simulations for each (percentage, pd) pair when: A. Symp-
toms appear before individuals become infectious; B. Symptoms appear after individuals
become infectious.

S9 Fig. Estimating the probability of a major outbreak with gamma distributed incubation
and infectious periods. The incubation and infectious periods are both split into three classes,
each with exponentially distributed waiting times. Since the true probability of a major out-
break is no longer restricted to discrete values, we classify the true probabilities into bins. The
bins are of size 0.1 for true probabilities greater than 0.3. Since lower true probabilities occur
infrequently, for computational efficiency we then consider true probabilities equal to 0, and
true probabilities greater than zero but less than 0.3, in their own bins.
