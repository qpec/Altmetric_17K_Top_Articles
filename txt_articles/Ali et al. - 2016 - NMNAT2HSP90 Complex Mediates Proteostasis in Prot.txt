Abstract
Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase 2 (NMNAT2) is neuroprotective in
numerous preclinical models of neurodegeneration. Here, we show that brain nmnat2
mRNA levels correlate positively with global cognitive function and negatively with AD
pathology. In AD brains, NMNAT2 mRNA and protein levels are reduced. NMNAT2 shifts its
solubility and colocalizes with aggregated Tau in AD brains, similar to chaperones, which
aid in the clearance or refolding of misfolded proteins. Investigating the mechanism of this
observation, we discover a novel chaperone function of NMNAT2, independent from its
enzymatic activity. NMNAT2 complexes with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to refold aggre-
gated protein substrates. NMNAT2’s refoldase activity requires a unique C-terminal ATP
site, activated in the presence of HSP90. Furthermore, deleting NMNAT2 function
increases the vulnerability of cortical neurons to proteotoxic stress and excitotoxicity. Inter-
estingly, NMNAT2 acts as a chaperone to reduce proteotoxic stress, while its enzymatic
activity protects neurons from excitotoxicity. Taken together, our data indicate that
NMNAT2 exerts its chaperone or enzymatic function in a context-dependent manner to
maintain neuronal health.

 Author Summary
Pathological protein aggregates are found in many neurodegenerative diseases, and it has
been hypothesized that these protein aggregates are toxic and cause neuronal death. Little
is known about how neurons protect against pathological protein aggregates to maintain
their health. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) is a newly
identified neuronal maintenance factor. We found that in humans, levels of NMNAT2
transcript are positively correlated with cognitive function and are negatively correlated
with pathological features of neurodegenerative disease like plaques and tangles. In this
study, we demonstrate that NMNAT2 can act as a chaperone to reduce protein aggregates,
and this function is independent from its known function in the enzymatic synthesis of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). We find that NMNAT2 interacts with heat
shock protein 90 (HSP90) to refold protein aggregates, and that deleting NMNAT2 in cor-
tical neurons renders them vulnerable to protein stress or excitotoxicity. Interestingly, the
chaperone function of NMNAT2 protects neurons from protein toxicity, while its enzy-
matic function is required to defend against excitotoxicity. Our work here suggests that
NMNAT2 uses either its chaperone or enzymatic function to combat neuronal insults in a
context-dependent manner. In Alzheimer disease brains, NMNAT2 levels are less than
50% of control levels, and we propose that enhancing NMNAT2 function may provide an
effective therapeutic intervention to reserve cognitive function.
Introduction
Robust neuronal maintenance mechanisms are required to minimize or repair damage arising
from intrinsic and extrinsic stressors. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases
(NMNATs) play important roles in neuronal maintenance in flies [1,2] and human [3–6], and
their overexpression provides neuroprotection in diverse neurodegenerative models [7,8].
NMNATs are known as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-synthesizing enzymes that
enable proper flux of NAD, an essential cofactor for many cellular processes [7,8]. The litera-
ture regarding the importance of this enzymatic activity in axonal health is mixed [8]. The
majority of evidence that supports the importance of NMNAT’s enzymatic activity comes
from studies using Wallerian degeneration models. Upon nerve cut, NAD levels are quickly
reduced, and exogenous NAD application offers protection [9–12]. Abolishing NMNAT enzy-
matic function impairs their axon-protective function against injuries [9,10,12–14]. However,
NMNAT enzymatic activity is not required to maintain neural integrity in Drosophila photore-
ceptors [2], suggesting that NMNATs may protect neurons by different mechanisms in a con-
text-dependent manner [7,8].
NMNAT2 has the shortest half-life among three mammalian NMNATs and its function in
axonal survival cannot be compensated by endogenous NMNAT1 or 3 [15,16]. The constant
axonal supply of NMNAT2 from Golgi-derived vesicles is critical to maintain axonal health
[16,17]. Constitutive NMNAT2 removal results in neurite outgrowth deficits [18,19], while
knocking down NMNAT2 in developed neurons causes axonal degeneration [15], a prominent
feature of many neurodegenerative diseases [20–23]. Importantly, NMNAT2 is highly
expressed in the mammalian brain [24,25]. nmnat2 mRNA levels are reduced in Parkinson,
Huntington, and Alzheimer diseases (AD), as well as in tauopathies [26–31], suggesting a role
of NMNAT2 in maintaining neuronal health in the aging brain. In rTg4510 transgenic mice, a
Frontotemporal Dementia and Parkinsonism-17 (FTDP-17) tauopathy model, NMNAT2
abundance declines prior to the onset of neurodegeneration or memory deficits [32].

 Moreover, elevating NMNAT2 levels in rTg4510 mice ameliorates their neurodegenerative
phenotype. These finding suggest a role for NMNAT2 in neuronal maintenance in the brain,
but the mechanism underlying neuroprotection remains to be elucidated.
Drosophila NMNAT (dNMNAT) also functions as a molecular chaperone [2]. Molecular
chaperones are defined as a class of proteins that interact with, stabilize, or assist proteins to
retain their native and functionally active conformation [33]. They are critical in maintaining
protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and to facilitate the clearance of pathological protein aggre-
gates [34,35]. Furthermore, the identification of synaptic chaperones has highlighted the
importance of chaperones in preserving neuronal function [36–40]. For example, the synaptic
vesicle protein cysteine string protein α (CSPα) forms a chaperone complex with heat shock
cognate 70 (Hsc70) and the small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat protein SGT to pro-
mote SNARE-complex assembly and maintain the presynaptic release machinery [37,38]. Hap-
loinsufficency of CSPα in humans causes autosomal dominant adult onset neuronal ceroid
lipofusinosis and leads to dementia [41,42].
Proteinopathies, including AD and tauopathies, are characterized by stereotypic aggregated
proteins, and this pathology is associated with cognitive impairment [43,44]. It has been pro-
posed that enhancing chaperone activity helps to establish a cytoprotective state, defending
against the cellular damage caused by misfolding and/or aggregation associated proteinopa-
thies [45]. The role of chaperones in AD has been studied extensively with respect to tau aggre-
gation and fibrillization. Chaperones, such as HSP70, HSP90, and the C-terminus of HSC70
Interacting Protein (CHIP) have been shown to preferentially bind to hyperphosphorylated
human Tau (p-hTau) as well as paired helical filamentous tau, but not to nonphosphorylated
tau [46]. Indeed, overexpression of cytosolic HSP70 and HSP90 inhibit the early stages of amy-
loid aggregation in AD models [47]. The reduced Tau burden upon elevating NMNAT2 levels
in rTg4510 mice [32] prompted us to ask the following three questions. Does NMNAT2 act as
a chaperone? Is this chaperone activity required for NMNAT2 to reduce tauopathy and protect
neurons against protein stress? How does NMNAT2 exert its chaperone function?
In this study, we validate the clinical relevance of human NMNAT2 levels by examining the
relationship between nmnat2 mRNA levels and the cognitive capabilities and AD pathology in
a large cohort of aged human subjects. In AD brains, NMNAT2 shifts into the insoluble frac-
tion together with chaperones like HSP70 [48–51]. Next, we show that NMNAT2 functions as
a chaperone in several in vitro and in vivo assays. We define the domain that acts as a chaper-
one and show that NMNAT2 acts with HSP90 to clear protein aggregates. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that NMNAT2’s enzymatic or chaperone function is differentially recruited to
protect neurons depending on the nature of insult. Deleting NMNAT2 in cortical neurons
increases their vulnerability to proteotoxic stress and excitotoxicity triggered by excessive neu-
rotransmission. The chaperone function of NMNAT2 is required to defend against proteotoxic
stress, while its enzymatic function is indispensible for maintaining viability under excitotoxic
conditions. Taken together, our findings suggest that the dual-functions of NMNAT2 protect
neurons and preserve cognitive function during aging.
Results
NMNAT2 mRNA Levels Positively Correlate with Global Cognitive
Function and Negatively with AD Pathology
To evaluate the clinical relevance of NMNAT2 in human brain, we examined postmortem
brain tissue and data available from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and
Aging Project [52–54]. These studies combine longitudinal clinical and cognitive evaluations
with brain neuropathological evaluations at death. A global cognitive summary measure is

 based on subject performance on a battery of 17 standardized cognitive tests, while a global AD
neuropathologic burden is computed from counts of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tan-
gles on silver-stained tissue sections from five brain regions [55,56]. nmnat1/2 mRNA levels
were extracted from an RNA-sequencing dataset profiling the transcriptome in dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex samples from 541 deceased subjects (mean age at death = 88.4 y, standard
deviation (sd) = 6.7; S1 Table). Higher nmnat2 mRNA levels are associated with better cogni-
tive performance proximate to death (p = 0.0007; Fig 1A–1D) as well as with a lower AD
neuropathological burden (p = 0.004; S2 Table). These associations are robust when adjusted
for age of death, postmortem interval and RNA quality (RNA integrity number; RIN) (S1
Table). By contrast, there is no relationship between nmnat1 mRNA levels with cognition or
AD pathology in this cohort (Fig 1B and 1C, S2 Table).
Causality cannot be inferred from such human data analysis. Path analysis, developed by
the geneticist Sewall Wright [57], is a standard approach in human genetics to examine the
complex interrelationships among multiple variables and to assess the relative importance of
these variables upon outcome(s) of interest, including a range of potential mediators [57–60].
We conducted path analysis to examine the interrelationship between nmnat2 expression, AD
pathology and cognition. Fig 1D illustrates our hypothetical structural model, including a
direct path that links nmnat2 expression to cognition, as well as an indirect path that links its
expression to AD pathology and, subsequently, to cognition. Standardized path coefficients
and the corresponding standard error for each path were reported to assess both the hypothe-
sized direct and indirect effect of nmnat2 expression on cognition, using standard notation
[60]. The relations represented by arrows in Fig 1D reflect our a priori hypothesis and are con-
sistent with, but are not proof of, causality. We find that about 30% of the effect of nmnat2
mRNA abundance on cognition is explained by global AD pathology (p = 0.003). This result is
consistent with a hypothetical model in which at least part of the relation between nmnat2 and
cognition is mediated by AD pathology. The placement of AD pathology downstream of
nmnat2 expression in this model suggests the role of NMNAT2 in modulating AD pathology.
An independent cohort of human cortical samples consisting of control and AD brains were
acquired from the Oregon Brain Bank. In this cohort, we observed a significant reduction of
nmnat2 mRNA as well as NMNAT2 protein but not NMNAT1 (S1 Fig; S3 Table). Soluble and
insoluble proteins were extracted sequentially from human postmortem brain tissues with pro-
gressively more stringent detergents thereby fractionating human brain proteins based on their
solubility [61,62], allowing the more soluble proteins to be extracted first. This was followed by
the extraction of membrane-bound proteins, and finally the most insoluble proteins were iso-
lated in a 2% SDS buffer. Aggregated proteins such as neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid pla-
ques are typically present in insoluble fractions prepared from AD brains [63]. The majority of
NMNAT2 in control brains was extracted in the soluble fraction (Fig 1E and 1F), while very lit-
tle NMNAT2 was found in the insoluble fraction. However, in brains of AD patients, abundant
NMNAT2 protein was detected in the insoluble fraction (p < 0.001). This fraction also contains
hyperphosphorylated hTau and HSP90 (Fig 1E). The strong shift in solubility of NMNAT2 in
AD brains is reminiscent of the behavior of chaperones, such as HSP70, HSP90 and HSP27, and
cochaperones such as CHIP, which have been linked to pathological aggregates in AD [64].
NMNAT2 Functions as a Chaperone with Both Holdase and Foldase
Activities
To assess the chaperone activity of human NMNAT2, we first conducted a cell-based luciferase
assay [65,66]. In this assay, treatment with cycloheximide (200 uM for 3 h) to block protein
synthesis, followed by heat denaturation (at 42°C for 15 min), renders the endogenous

 chaperone machinery incapable of preventing luciferase aggregation and refolding (Fig 2A).
This allows for a direct measurement of the chaperone activity of the introduced test protein
by its ability to prevent luciferase from undergoing heat shock-induced denaturation (holdase
activity) and to promote proper refolding (foldase activity) of heat-denatured luciferase during

pathologic burden. (E–F) NMNAT2 protein levels were reduced in the soluble fractions of AD brains. The insoluble fraction contains aggregated proteins
such as insoluble Tau (revealed by PHF-1 antibody, which detects p-S396/404 hTau). NMNAT2 and HSP90 shift solubility in AD brains, appearing in the
insoluble fraction. *,*** indicate p < 0.05, p < 0.001. The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction. Data

 recovery (at 37°C for 3 h). We found that NMNAT2’s holdase and foldase activity are compa-
rable to that of HSP70 (S2 Fig). In other words, NMNAT2 reduces luciferase aggregation upon
thermal stress and promotes its refolding, as indicated by higher luciferase activity postrecovery
in NMNAT2 overexpressing cells.

 To assess if NMNAT2 can directly bind to substrates and reduce protein aggregation in the
absence of other proteins, a cell-free chaperone activity assay was performed. In the presence
of thermal stress, citrate synthase (CS) aggregates leading to increased optical absorbance that
can be detected as a result of Raleigh scattering [67]. This assay with recombinant proteins
allows us to examine whether NMNAT2 can exert holdase activity to maintain CS in a thermo-
stable conformation in the absence of other chaperones, cochaperones, or ATP. Both
NMNAT2 and HSP70, but not lysozyme, are capable of preventing thermally-induced CS
aggregation in a dose-dependent manner (S3 Fig).
The Enzymatic and Chaperone Function of NMNAT2 Are Mediated by
Different Protein Domains
Homology-based structural modeling of NMNAT2 shows that both the N- and C-terminal
domains are highly conserved among NMNATs [24], while the central domain of NMNAT2 is
different [68]. Both NAD synthesis activity [68,69] and chaperone function are comparable
among NMNAT1-3 (S2 and S3 Figs). Previous studies have shown that mutating W92G elimi-
nates more than 95% of NMNAT2’s catalytic activity [14,70] whereas mutating two palmitoy-
lation sites (Cys-164 and Cys-165) in the central region of the protein increases stability
[16,17]. We therefore generated an enzyme-dead (ED) NMNAT2 by mutating residue W92
(NMNAT2W92G; ED) or by deleting residues 1 to 100 of the N-terminus (Δ1–100; ΔNT) to
entirely eliminate NMNAT2’s NAD catalytic activity (Fig 2B, S4A and S4B Fig). As shown in
Fig 2C, both NMNAT2-ΔNT (p = 0.0004) and -ED (p = 0.0098) retained the ability to decrease
luciferase aggregation and increase refolding similarly to NMNAT2-WT and HSP70.
Mutating the palmitoylation sites at Cys-164 /Cys-165 to serines (C164S;C165S; PM) signif-
icantly improved enzymatic (p < 0.001) and chaperone activity (p < 0.0001) for either holdase
or foldase activity (Fig 2C) in addition to its stability (S4C Fig). However, deleting the C-termi-
nal domain (Δ200–308; ΔCT) severely impaired NMNAT2’s foldase (p < 0.0001) but not its
holdase activity (p = 0.87, compared to WT; Fig 2C), suggesting that this domain is selectively
required for foldase activity. ATP binding has been shown to enhance chaperone activity of the
large heat shock protein families by suppressing protein unfolding and aggregation [35,71–74].
The C-terminal region of NMNAT is predicted to contain an ATP-binding site spanning resi-
dues 269–274. These residues are highly conserved among NMNATs. Deleting 5 aa in the C-
terminal ATP site (Δ269–274; ΔcATP) renders NMNAT2 incapable of promoting luciferase
refolding (p < 0.0001, Fig 2C) but does not affect NAD synthesis (p = 0.79, S4A and S4B Fig).
The deficits in foldase activity observed in NMNAT2-ΔCT and -ΔcATP are unlikely to be
caused by alterations in their stability, as the half-lives of these proteins are similar to
NMNAT2-WT, -ΔNT, and -ED (S4C Fig). Hence, our data indicate that the C-terminal ATP
site is critical for NMNAT2’s foldase function, and the domains implicated in NAD enzymatic
and chaperone function are mutually exclusive.
The Chaperone Function of NMNAT2 Is Required to Reduce pTau
Intracellular aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau into filamentous inclusions
is a defining characteristic of AD. Because the appearance of tau-aggregate bearing lesions cor-
relates with both cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, it has been hypothesized that
hyperphosphorylated tau may be directly toxic to the cells that harbor them. Our previous
studies showed that NMNAT2 overexpression in the hippocampi of rTg4510 mice, a tauopathy
model [75,76], is sufficient to reduce p-hTau burden [32]. To determine whether NMNAT2’s
chaperone function is required for p-hTau clearance, we first tested NMNAT2 WT and various
mutants in a HEK293-tau cell line stably expressing a doxycycline-inducible human tau40

 (Fig 3A and 3B) [77]. In these cells, an increase in p-hTau is induced 48–72 h after doxycycline
treatment. This p-hTau is easily detected by the PHF-1 antibody that detects p-S396/404 Tau
[77,78]. Overexpression of NMNAT2-WT (p = 0.009), -ED (p = 0.013), -PM (p = 0.011), or
HSP70 (p = 0.024) significantly reduced p-hTau by half, but not total, hTau in the doxycycline-
induced cells (Fig 3A and 3B). However, NMNAT2-ΔCT (p = 0.682) or -ΔcATP (p = 0.763)
overexpression failed to reduce p-hTau levels, suggesting that NMNAT2’s chaperone function
is required to reduce p-hTau in this in vitro Tau model.
To further demonstrate that NMNAT2’s chaperone activity is required for p-hTau clear-
ance in vivo, we examined the impact of NMNAT2-WT, -ED, -ΔcATP and GFP overexpres-
sion on p-hTau levels in the hippocampus of rTg4510 mice (Fig 3C). 1 μl of 109 particles of
recombinant adenoassociated virus (rAAV) carrying GFP- or HA-tagged NMNAT2-WT, -ED,
-ΔcATP was injected into the hippocampi of 6-wk-old rTg4510 mice (n = 17), which corre-
sponds to the age when endogenous NMNAT2 begins to decline [32]. The impact of GFP or
NMNAT2-WT, -ED, -ΔcATP expression on hTau was evaluated 1-mo post injection with
immunostaining (Fig 3C). The MC1-antibody that recognizes conformational changes in hTau
[79] was employed to evaluate the impact of NMNAT2 and its variants on hTau processing,
while an HA-antibody identified exogenous NMNAT2 or its variants (Fig 3C and 3D). The
overall intensity of MC1 immunoreactivity in the CA1 region of the hippocampi was quanti-
fied, and NMNAT2-WT (p < 0.001), -ED (p < 0.001), but not -ΔcATP (p = 0.68) significantly
reduced the levels of conformationally altered hTau recognized by the MC-1 antibody (Fig 3C
and 3D). To quantify the impact of NMNAT2 overexpression on hTau processing, western
blot analysis was conducted with tissue homogenates prepared from EGFP and
NMNAT2-WT, -ED, -ΔcATP rAAV transduced hippocampi of rTg4510 mice one mo postin-
jection (Fig 3E and 3F). The levels of p-hTau were evaluated with AT8 (recognizing p-S202/
205 hTau [80]) and PHF-1 antibodies. Overexpressing NMNAT2-WT (p < 0.001), -ED
(p < 0.001), but not NMNAT2-ΔcATP (p = 0.59) or GFP significantly reduced p-hTau levels
in rTg4510 hippocampi while total hTau levels remained unchanged (Fig 3F). These data pro-
vide compelling evidence that NMNAT2’s chaperone activity but not its enzymatic function is
critical in ameliorating proteotoxic stress caused by hTau overexpression.
NMNAT2’s Foldase Activity Requires an NMNAT2:HSP90 Complex
How does NMNAT2 act as a chaperone? Does NMNAT2 function together with known chap-
erones HSP70/90 or cochaperones HOP and CHIP [81] to reduce protein aggregates? To deter-
mine if NMNAT2 interacts with other chaperones, we conducted immunoprecipitation
experiments of NMNAT2 to determine whether HSP70, HSP90, HOP, or CHIP complex with
NMNAT2 in hTau40 cell lines after induction of hTau40 expression. As shown in Fig 4A,
NMNAT2 complexes with HSP90 but not HSP70, HOP or CHIP in NMNAT2-transfected
HEK293-tau cells, via its C-terminus (S6 Fig). Similar to NMNAT2, HSP90 is also present in
the insoluble fraction prepared from human AD brains but not control brains (Fig 1E). In aged
rTg4510 cortex, NMNAT2 is also present in the insoluble fraction where p-hTau and HSP90
are concentrated (S5 Fig). NMNAT2 and HSP90 not only form complexes with each other (S6
Fig) in rTg4510 cortex (Fig 4B) but also bind to hTau (Fig 4B). These interactions are likely to
be evolutionarily conserved as proteomic studies in Drosophila also identified HSP83, the Dro-
sophila HSP90 homolog, as a dNMNAT-interacting protein (S4 Table).
HSP90 binds to non-native polypeptides to prevent aggregate formation, mainly at the late
stages of substrate folding, a function that is tightly regulated [81]. To determine whether
HSP90 is required for NMNAT2’s ability to reduce protein aggregates, we reduced HSP90 lev-
els by either using HSP90-specific siRNA or by pharmacological blockade with 17-allylamino-

 17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), an HSP90-specific inhibitor [82] (Fig 4C). We first
examined the impact of reducing HSP90 expression level on NMNAT2’s ability to attenuate p-
hTau burden. Briefly, cells were transfected with NMNAT2-WT, and either HSP90 siRNA or
scrambled siRNA 12 h prior to doxycycline induction. p-hTau abundance in these cells was
examined 48 h post doxycycline induction. We found that decreasing HSP90 function severely
impaired NMNAT2’s ability to reduce p-hTau (Fig 4D; p < 0.001for siRNA).

 To determine whether NMNAT2 requires HSP90 to exert its function as a holdase or a fol-
dase, we performed luciferase-refolding assays (Fig 2A). The cells were transfected with Lucif-
erase and NMNAT2-WT together with scrambled or HSP90 siRNA (Fig 4E). To test the drug,
the cells were treated with 500 nM 17-AAG, 24 h prior to heat shock treatment. We found that
HSP90 reduction by either HSP90-siRNA (p < 0.001) or 17-AAG (p < 0.001) prevented
NMNAT2’s facilitation of the recovery of aggregated luciferase, but these treatments have a
minimal impact on NMNAT2’s holdase activity (Fig 4E). These data suggest that NMNAT2
requires HSP90 for its foldase activity to reduce the proteotoxic burden.
HSP90 can regulate the stress response by modulating the activity of Heat Shock Factor 1
(HSF1). During nonstressed condition, HSP90 binds to HSF1 and p23-immunophilins [83].
This binding prevents HSF1 from activating the transcription of the heat shock response genes.
Upon stress or heat shock, protein aggregates sequester HSP90 [83,84], freeing HSF1 to acti-
vate transcription of the heat shock response genes [83]. Hence, reduction or inhibition of
HSP90 promotes the heat shock response (Fig 4C, S7 Fig). To assess if HSF1 plays a role in the
chaperoning activity of NMNAT2, we blocked HSF1 effects on HSP transcription using 10 μM
KRIBB-11 (KRI) (Fig 4C) [85,86]. KRI application minimally impacted NMNAT2’s chaperone
activity (p = 0.47, Fig 4E). Moreover, coapplication of KRI with either AAG or an siRNA for
HSP90 resulted in changes that were similar to those seen with AAG or siRNA alone (p = 0.54,
compared to siRNA alone). Consistent with the data obtained from the luciferase assay, HSF-1
inhibition had no impact on NMNAT2-mediated clearance of p-hTau (Fig 4D). These observa-
tions rule out a contribution by HSF1 to NMNAT2’s chaperone function. Taken together, our
results show that NMNAT2 requires HSP90 for its foldase activity to reduce the proteotoxic
burden in this hTau model.
ATPase activity is often required for molecular chaperone activity. As demonstrated above,
NMNAT2’s C-terminal ATP binding site is essential for its foldase activity. Hence, we tested
whether this site has ATPase activity. Unlike HSP90, recombinant NMNAT2 shows no mea-
surable ATPase activity in the presence of denatured CS substrate (Fig 4F, S8 and S9 Figs).
However, addition of HSP90 stimulated NMNAT2’s ATPase activity (p = 0.0002 compared to
HSP90; Fig 4F, S8B Fig). The importance of the C-terminal mutant missing this ATP binding
site for this ATPase activity is demonstrated by the observation that the C-terminal mutant
without this ATP site lacked ATPase activity in the presence of misfolded CS and HSP90
(p = 0.38 compared to HSP90; Fig 4F, S9 Fig). Our findings thus suggest that a complex of
NMNAT2 with HSP90 induces a conformational change that stimulates NMNAT2’s ATPase
activity, allowing it to function as a foldase (Fig 4G).
NMNAT2: HSP90 Mitigates Proteotoxicity in a SCA1 Model of PolyQ
Disorder
As nmnat2 transcript levels are reduced in various proteinopathies (S5 Table), we examined
whether NMNAT2’s chaperone function is able to reduce aggregates of polyglutamine repeat
expanded Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 1 (SCA1) protein. We conducted a cell-based human
Ataxin1-[82Q]-GFP aggregation assay [87], in which the polyglutamine protein forms nuclear
aggregates, observed in SCA1 pathology (Fig 5). Ataxin1-[82Q]-GFP forms numerous and
often large protein aggregates in nucleus and cytoplasm of Cos7 cells (Fig 5A and 5B). In the
presence of NMNAT2-WT (p < 0.0001), -ΔNT (p < 0.0001), -ED (p < 0.0001), -PM
(p < 0.0001), the size of these GFP aggregates are significantly smaller than the aggregates
found in mCherry expressing cells, or neighboring untransfected cells (empty). However,
NMNAT2-ΔCT (p = 0.52) or -ΔcATP (p = 0.631) overexpression failed to reduce the size of

 Ataxin1-[82Q]-GFP aggregates, again suggesting that the chaperoning activity of NMNAT2
plays a critical role in dampening the formation of protein aggregates.
To distinguish between soluble and insoluble Ataxin1-[82Q]-GFP aggregates, cells were
lysed and fractionated [87]. NMNAT2 overexpression reduced the amount of both soluble
(p = 0.0004) and insoluble (p < 0.0001) Ataxin1-[82Q]-GFP aggregates (Fig 5C and 5D).
Again, NMNAT2’s chaperone function, but not NAD synthase activity, is required for amelio-
rating the proteotoxic burden in SCA-1. Furthermore, in Ataxin1-[82Q]-GFP and NMNAT2
expressing Cos7 cells, NMNAT2 also complexes with HSP90, but not with HSP70, CHIP, or

 HOP (Fig 5E). Knocking-down HSP90 with HSP90 siRNA also prevented the reduction of sol-
uble or insoluble ataxin1 aggregates by NMNAT2 (Fig 5F and 5G). However, HSF-1 inhibition
with KRI minimally affected NMNAT2-mediated clearance of Ataxin1-82Q-GFP aggregates.
Hence, HSF1-mediated transcription does not mediate NMNAT2’s chaperone function in this
model system. All the above results provide strong evidence that the NMNAT2: HSP90 com-
plex is capable of reducing aggregated proteins in different proteinopathies (S14 Fig).
NMNAT2 Loss-of-Function Renders Cortical Neurons More Sensitive to
Stress
Loss of NMNAT2 in mice causes death at birth [18]. To assess NMNAT2’s function in the cen-
tral nervous system (CNS), cortical neurons were prepared from NMNAT2 WT (NMNAT2
+/+), HET (NMNAT2+/-), and KO (NMNAT2-/-) embryos. We quantitatively compared the
viability of NMNAT2 WT, HET, and KO cortical neurons at different days-in-vitro (DIV)
using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) reduction
assay, a colorimetric assay routinely used to estimate the number of viable cells [88]; Fig 6). We
found that the viability of NMNAT2 KO neurons decreases as they mature and form numerous
synapses (S10A Fig). Next, we treated DIV14 cortical neurons with 10 μM MG132, a proteoso-
mal inhibitor, for 12 h to promote their demise via proteotoxic stress. Interestingly, loss of
NMNAT2 also increases the vulnerability of DIV14 cortical neurons to proteotoxic stress (Fig
6A; p < 0.0001), suggesting that NMNAT2 deletion renders neurons sensitive to proteosomal
stress. To determine whether NMNAT2’s chaperone function is required for its ability to pro-
tect cortical neurons against MG132-induced proteotoxicity, we transduced NMNAT2 KO
cortical neurons with a lentiviral vector (LV) carrying NMNAT2 WT or various mutants at
DIV2. At DIV14, the viability of these neurons was assessed by the MTT reduction assay after
MG132 treatment. Overexpression of NMNAT2-WT (p = 0.0024), or -ED (p = 0.0013), but
not NMNAT2-ΔcATP (p = 0.784), significantly increased the viability of NMNAT2 KO neu-
rons post MG132 treatment (Fig 6A, S11 Fig). Interestingly, in WT neurons, NMNAT2 overex-
pression completely mitigated the toxic impact of protein stress (Fig 6A). Such protection by
NMNAT2 depends on its chaperone but not enzymatic function. Hence, the chaperone func-
tion of NMNAT2 is required to protect cortical neurons against MG132 induced proteotoxi-
city, whereas its NAD synthesis activity is dispensable.
In Drosophila photoreceptors, dNMNAT protects neurons against activity-related insults
[1]. Here, we found that upon massive glutamate release triggered by KCl treatment (30 mM for
24 h), the viability of NMNAT2 KO neurons was significantly decreased even at DIV10, while
the viability of NMNAT2 WT and HET neurons was not affected by KCl treatment (Fig 6B,
S10B and S11A Figs). At DIV20, both NMNAT2 HET (p < 0.01) and KO (p < 0.0001), neurons
are significantly more sensitive to KCl-triggered excitotoxicity compared to NMNAT2 WT neu-
rons (S10B Fig). Overexpression of NMNAT2-WT (p < 0.0001), -ΔcATP (p < 0.0001), but not
NMNAT2-ED (p = 0.162), in NMNAT2 KO neurons significantly restored their resistance to
KCl-induced cell death (Fig 6B, S11B Fig). Similarly, NMNAT2 overexpression in WT neurons
completely prevented the excitotoxicity and this protection required NMNAT2’s enzymatic
activity. Thus, cortical neurons require NMNAT2’s enzymatic but not chaperone function to
protect them against excitoxicity. Taken together, both the enzymatic and chaperone activity of
NMNAT2 are important to maintain neuronal health in a context-dependent manner.
NMNAT2 May Play a Role in Synaptic Maintenance
Synapses are often the first structures lost in neurodegenerative disease [89]. Vertebrate
NMNAT2 has been detected in synaptic membranes and vesicles of cortical neurons [17,24]

 suggesting a role for NMNAT2 in synapse maintenance. Immunostaining of DIV10 cultured
neurons reveals a decrease of presynaptic proteins such as VGluT1 and synaptophysin (SYPH)
in NMNAT2 HET neurons when compared to WT (S12 Fig. Almost no VGluT1 or SYPH sig-
nals are seen in the axons of NMNAT2 KO neurons. Loss of NMNAT2 significantly reduces
levels of synaptic vesicle proteins such as SNAP25 (p = 0.0071) and SYPH (p = 0.032) as well as

 the active zone protein RIM1α (Fig 7A; p = 0.0028). In 8-mo-old NMNAT2 WT and HET
brains, NMNAT2 protein levels are variable (Fig 7B and 7C). Interestingly, the abundance of
presynaptic proteins like SYPH (p < 0.0001, r = 0.9633), VGluT1 (p < 0.0001, r = 0.9577),
SNAP25 (p < 0.0001, r = 0.9526) and RIM1α (p < 0.0001, r = 0.9701) are positively correlated
with NMNAT2 levels (Fig 7C). In addition, the levels of neurofilament (p = 0.033, r = 0.6159)
and microtubule binding protein MAP2 (p = 0.0067, r = 0.7325) are also significantly corre-
lated to NMNAT2 levels, whereas levels of HSP90 and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NR1)
were not significantly related. Taken together, our data indicate that NMNAT2 plays a signifi-
cant role in synaptic maintenance.
Discussion
Here, we provide compelling evidence that NMNAT2 acts as a potent chaperone for denatured
luciferase, p-hTau, and ataxin1-82Q-GFP. NMNAT2’s C-terminal ATP site is required for its
chaperone activity but not for its NAD synthesis activity. The ED (NAD synthesis incompe-
tent) NMNAT2 mutant has comparable chaperone activity to wildtype NMNAT2 in restoring
luciferase activity as well as in reducing p-Tau and ataxin1-82Q-GFP. In rTg4510 mice, both
WT- and ED-, but not chaperone-compromized-NMNAT2, were effective in reducing the
abundance of both p-hTau and pathological hTau. This finding implicates an in vivo require-
ment of NMNAT2’s chaperone activity in p-hTau clearance. Its partial loss may therefore pro-
mote neurodegeneration in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, whereas increased levels
of NMNAT2 may protect against the demise of neurons.
NMNAT2 exerts both a holdase function, whereby it binds to aggregation-prone proteins to
reduce their aggregation, and a foldase function, whereby it binds to and refolds aggregated or
conformationally abnormal proteins. Using a CS aggregation assay, we found that NMNAT2
alone can act as holdase, while it requires HSP90 to refold CS aggregates. Importantly, the
interaction with HSP90 activates NMNAT2’s C-terminal ATPase activity when protein aggre-
gates are present. This C-terminus ATP binding site is required for NMNAT2’s foldase activity.
It is likely that the ATPase activity triggered by HSP90 binding is required for NMNAT2 to
refold its client proteins. Independently, a Drosophila proteomic screen also identified the
HSP90 homolog, HSP83, as a dNMNAT interacting partner, suggesting the NMNAT2 and
HSP90 interaction is conserved during evolution. In addition to hTau, HSP90 is also required
for NMNAT2 to reduce CS aggregation as well as refolding of denatured luciferase and Atax-
in1-polyQ aggregates. The conservation of such interactions across diverse systems attests to a
broad role for the HSP90:NMNAT2 complex in mitigating proteotoxic aggregation.
Previous studies using nerve injury models have proposed that NMNAT2 supplies NAD to
maintain axonal integrity [15–17,90]. Here, we found that deleting NMNAT2 in cortical neu-
rons renders them sensitive to both proteotoxic stress and excitotoxicity triggered by sustained
neuronal depolarization. In wildtype neurons, NMNAT2 overexpression has no impact on
baseline cell viability but strengthens neuronal defense mechanisms to combat neural insults
triggered by excessive protein stress or neurotransmission. Interestingly, the chaperone func-
tion of NMNAT2 is required to counter protein stress while the enzymatic function of
NMNAT2 provides protection against excitotoxicity. The restoration of NMNAT2 KO neu-
rons’ resistance to activity induced insults by over expression of enzymatically competent
NMNAT2 reveals a similar context-dependent protection mechanism.
It remains to be determined how NMNAT2 switches between these two functional modes to
protect against these distinct insults. Using Cos7 cells, we demonstrate that NMNAT2 only
complexes with HSP90 upon protein stress (S13 Fig) despite both proteins being highly
expressed. The observation of increased NMNAT2:HSP90 complex formation in the

 hippocampi of rTg4510 mice compared to wildtype mice suggests that protein stress triggered
NMNAT2:HSP90 complex formation also occurs in vivo. Interestingly, NMNAT2’s ATPase
activity is only activated when both HSP90 and protein aggregates are present. Taken together,
we propose that NMNAT2 forms complexes with different partners depending on the nature of
the insult and complex formation allows it to switch modes of actions to offer neuroprotection.
The localization of NMNAT2 in synaptosomal fractions prepared from whole mouse brains
suggests the presence of NMNAT2 in synapses [24]. In Drosophila, dNMNAT maintains syn-
aptic structure by stabilizing the active zone protein Bruchpilot [91], and photoreceptors that
lack dNMNAT are sensitive to light or neural activity [1]. Loss of NMNAT2 significantly
reduces the levels of presynaptic proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role of
NMNAT2 in neurite outgrowth [18,19]. The reduction in axon number and length can account
for the reduction of presynaptic proteins we detected in NMNAT2 KO neurons. However,
immunostaining reveals reduced immunoreactivity for synaptic vesicle proteins VGluT1 and
synaptophysin in NMNAT2 KO axons (S12 Fig). This suggests that NMNAT2 is required not
only for axonal outgrowth but also for maintaining synaptic proteins in axonal arbors. The
finding of a positive correlation between NMNAT2 levels and presynaptic proteins in adult
mice provide additional support for the role of NMNAT2 in maintaining synaptic integrity.
The dual-function of NMNAT2 makes it a very potent neuronal maintenance factor; it can
provide sufficient local NAD to maintain neurons after high frequency neurotransmission and
can also act as a chaperone to reduce proteinopathies. Such dual protection is likely to be
important in preventing synaptic loss and preserve cognitive function during aging.
Our studies of NMNAT2 transcript levels, AD pathology, and cognitive performance in the
human cohort studies represent associations, and on their own, do not establish causality. It is
interesting that NMNAT2 but not NMNAT1 levels are reduced in AD brains. The shift of
NMNAT2 solubility to an insoluble compartment in AD brains and its partitioning with
hyperphosphorylated hTau, provides strong support for NMNAT2’s role as a molecular chap-
erone in the human brain. Due to NMNAT2’s short half-life [15,17], the appropriate level of
NMNAT2 is likely to be actively regulated to ensure optimal neuronal function. In rTg4510
mice, NMNAT2 levels are reduced prior to neurodegeneration, a reduction due in part from
decreased CREB-mediated nmnat2 transcription [32]. Decreased CREB activity has been
reported in human AD brains and mouse AD models [92]. Thus, it is plausible in human that
reduced CREB activity results in a decrease in NMNAT2 and synaptic loss, culminating in
dementia. Deleting NMNAT2 function in mouse cortical neurons decreases presynaptic mark-
ers and increases sensitivity to excitotoxicity and protein stress. NMNAT2’s enzymatic activity
is required to reduce excitotoxicity upon excessive neurotransmission, while it works together
with HSP90 to reduce protein stress through its chaperone function. Elucidating how nmnat2
levels are regulated may help to reveal preventive therapies to protect neurons from nmnat2
down-regulation and cognitive decline. NMNAT2’s chaperone function is a promising thera-
peutic target to protect against CNS proteinopathies.

men and women primarily from retirement facilities in the Chicago area who were at least 53 y
of age and free of known dementia at the time of enrollment. All participants in ROS and MAP
signed an informed consent agreeing to annual detailed clinical evaluations and cognitive tests,
and the rate of follow-up exceeds 90%. Similarly, participants in both cohorts signed an Ana-
tomical Gift Act donating their brains at the time of death. The mean for the interval between
last study evaluation and death is 8.2 mo. The overall autopsy rate exceeds 85%. All aspects of
these studies were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Rush University Medical
Center and Partners Healthcare. More detailed information regarding the two cohorts can be
found in previously published literature [52,53]. The global cognitive performance score has
been previously described and was determined based on 17 cognitive tests, measuring 5
domains of cognitive function (episodic memory, visuospatial ability, perceptual speed, seman-
tic memory, and working memory), and collected at annual evaluations proximate to death
[55]. Results of each test were converted into a Z score using the mean and SD from baseline
evaluations of all participants and then averaged to compute the composite measure of global
cognition. For descriptive purposes and for the subgroup analysis presented in both S1 and S2
Tables, and Fig 1, the clinical diagnoses of dementia and AD were made following National
Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke–Alzheimer’s Disease and
Related Disorders Association recommendations [93,94]. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
referred to those individuals rated as cognitively impaired by the neuropsychologist but not
demented by the examining physician, as previously described [95]. The quantitative global
AD pathology measure has been extensively described in prior publications [56]. Bielschowsky
silver stain was used to visualize and count neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles on rep-
resentative sections from midfrontal, middle temporal, inferior parietal, and entorhinal corti-
ces, and the hippocampal CA1 sector. Raw counts were divided by the population standard
deviation of the region-specific counts, and the scaled counts were averaged over the five brain
regions to create a global summary measure. RNA-seq data was generated using postmortem
brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) from ROS/MAP subjects. The RNA was extracted
from the tissue after the quality control evaluation based on RIN score [96] or RNA were
extracted first, and then RIN was used to filter out low-quality samples. The library was
sequenced using Illumina Hi-Seq with 101 bp reads and 4-plex pooling. All the paired-end
reads were mapped using RSEM alignment using Bowtie as the aligner [97] using the human
genome transcriptomic database from Ensemble (http://www.ensembl.org). The Fragment Per
Kilobase Per Million (FPKM) was calculated for the nmnat1 or nmnat2, and these values were
regarded as expression quantity for each gene and its isoform for further analysis. Linear
regression was used to evaluate the relationship between transcript levels (nmnat1 or nmnat2)
and either global cognition or global AD pathology summary score. Since the scaled outcome
of AD pathologic burden was right skewed, we applied square root transformation prior to the
analyses. All analyses were adjusted for age at death, gender, postmortem interval, and RIN
score. p < 0.0125 was considered significant after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing (α =
0.05 divided by 4 [2 transcripts + 2 outcomes]. Path analysis was used to evaluate structural

 models linking nmnat2 mRNA expression, global AD pathology, and global cognition proxi-
mate to death. Standardized path coefficients along individual pathways were used to assess the
total direct and indirect effects of nmnat2 expression on cognition. All tests were performed
using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Mplus, version 7.0 (Muthen &
Muthen, 1998–2012).
Human Brain Samples
Frozen cortical tissue was obtained from the Oregon Brain Bank at Oregon Health and Science
University (OHSU) in Portland, OR. These subjects were enrolled and clinically evaluated at
the NIH-sponsored Layton Aging and AD Center (ADC) at OHSU. Every subject received
annual neurological and neuropsychological evaluations, with a clinical dementia rating (CDR)
assigned by an experienced clinician. The AD subjects were diagnosed according to the
National Institute for Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Disorder Association diagnostic criteria for clinical AD, followed by neu-
ropathologic confirmation at autopsy. Neuropathologic assessment conformed to National
Institute on Aging-Reagan consensus criteria. All brain tissue was examined by a neuropathol-
ogist for neurodegenerative pathology including neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques
and assigned an amyloid score based on the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain (0, no
plaques; 1, sparse plaques; 2, moderate plaques; 3, dense plaques), and a Braak stage (0–6; with
6 being the most severe) indicative of the level and location of hyperphosphorylated tau tangles
[98]. In addition to the pathological information detailed above, demographical data including
age, sex, and MMSE score for each case were received along with the frozen tissue (S3 Table).
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
For each sample, RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. Two
micrograms of RNA were used for the reverse transcription reaction with the High Capacity
RNA to cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Quantification of nmnat2 and nmnat1
mRNA was performed using a CFX Touch Realtime PCR System (BioRad). The housekeeping
genes, 18s and gapdh, were used as internal controls to normalize mRNA expression. Amplifi-
cation mix (25 μl) consisted of 0.1 μg cDNA, 12.5 μl TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) and 1 μl TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Hs00322752_m1 nmnat2,
Hs00276702_m1 nmnat1, Hs99999901_s1 18s, Hs02758991_g1 gapdh, Mm99999915_g1).
Samples were amplified by a PCR program of 40 cycles of 10 s at 95°C, 15 s at 55°C, and 1 min
at 72°C. The Ct value was defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescence to
exceed the detection threshold, and the data were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCt method to quanti-
tatively assess relative changes in gene expression [99]. Briefly, the raw Ct values were averaged
for samples per group (AD, NDAN, and age-matched controls) for nmnat1, nmnat2, gapdh,
and 18s. ΔCt values were calculated by subtracting the geometric means of gapdh and 18s Ct
value from that of nmnat1 and nmnat2. The relative expression of nmnat1 and nmnat2 in AD
and NDAN samples compared with controls was obtained by calculating the ΔΔCt value for
each group by subtracting the average ΔCt value of control nmnat1/nmnat2 from AD/NDAN
average ΔCt. The relative fold change of AD/NDAN groups to control was expressed as 2−ΔΔCt.
Human Tissue RNA Extraction
Total RNA was extracted from human brain samples using Trizol reagent (Life Technology,
Grand Island, NY). 0.5 mL of 100% isopropanol was added to the aqueous phase, per 1 mL of
TRIzol Reagent used for homogenization and the samples were incubated at room temperature
for 10 minutes before centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4°C. RNA was purified from

 the extracts using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to man-
ufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration and purity were determined using a Nanodrop
spectrophotometer.
Human Tissue Protein Extraction
Human brain samples were prepared for protein extraction using the differential fractionation
method previously described [61,62]. This method relies on the use of increasingly stringent
detergents that allow for soluble and peripheral membrane proteins to be extracted first, fol-
lowed by extraction of membrane-bound proteins, and finally the most insoluble proteins are
extracted into a 2% SDS buffer. Briefly, brain tissue was collected and frozen immediately with
liquid nitrogen. Prior to extraction, the frozen brain tissue was weighed and homogenized in
15 volumes of ice-cold TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl) containing protease
and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Branford, CT). The samples were centrifuged at 175,000 x
g for 1 h at 4°C and the supernatants collected as the TBS fraction. The pellets were resus-
pended in ice-cold TBS buffer, spun at 175,000 x g for 1 h at 4°C, and the supernatants were
discarded. Ice-cold TBS (pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and 1% Tri-
ton X-100 (TBS-X) were added to the pellet and the suspension homogenized. The samples
were centrifuged at 170,000 x g for 1 h at 4°C and the supernatants collected as the TBS-Tri-
tonX fraction (soluble fraction). During the next myelin flotation phase, the pellet from the
previous step was washed in TBS-TritonX buffer with 30% sucrose at room temperature for 1 h
(with rotational shaking). This fraction was centrifuged at 175,000 x g for 1 h at 4°C, and the
supernatants were discarded. The final pellet containing the insoluble material was re-sus-
pended in 2% SDS buffer (insoluble fraction). Protein concentrations were determined using
the Bradford Assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
Upon measurement of total protein concentrations, this extraction scheme applied to con-
trol brains yields 32% of total proteins in the TBS fraction, 65% in the TBS-TritonX fraction,
and around 2% in the insoluble fraction. In comparison, in AD brains, around 26% of total
protein is present in the TBS fraction, 68% in TBS-TritonX fraction and roughly 5% in the
insoluble fraction, reflecting the higher level of insoluble protein present in AD brains.
Western Blotting
For analysis of protein expression, 10 μg of total protein lysate per sample were resolved by
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane, and probed with antibodies against the HA-tag (1/5,000; Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA), ß-actin (1/4,000; Sigma), hTau (1/1,000; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), GFP (1/1,000,
Invitrogen), GAPDH (1/5000, Millipore, Temecula, CA), PHF-1 (1/1,000, gift from Dr. Peter
Davies), AT8 (P1/1,000 Pierce/Thermofisher, Waltham, MA), Neurofilament-M (1/2,000,
Millipore, Temecula, CA), HSP70 (1/1,000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), HSP90 (1/1,000, Novus
Biological, Littleton, CO), CHIP (1/1,000, Novus Biological, Littleton, CO), HOP (1/1,000,
Novus Biological, Littleton, CO). Western blot analysis was performed with infrared dye conju-
gated secondary antibodies, IR700 and IR800 (1/10,000, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).
Blots were imaged and processed on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Densitometry anal-
ysis was performed on all the blots using ImageJ software (NIH). Data are represented as
means ± SEM.
To study changes in neuronal proteins in aged NMNAT2-HET and wild type littermate
brains, the cortex and hippocampus were dissected out and homogenized in Syn-PER Synaptic
Protein Extraction buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, GrandIsland, NY). Part of the total homog-
enate from each brain was stored, while the rest was used for synaptic fractionation, to enrich

 for synaptic proteins, using manufacturer’s protocol. Protein concentrations were calculated
using Bradford Assay (BioRad). For analysis of protein expression, 10 μg of total protein lysate
per sample were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, trans-
ferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibodies against Synaptophysin (1/
4,000, Millipore, Temecula, CA), SNAP-25 (1/1,000, Synaptic Systems, GmbH, Germany),
Neurofilament (1/1,000, Millipore, Temecula, CA), VGlut2 (1/1,000, Synaptic Systems, GmbH,
Germany), GAPDH (1/5,000, Millipore, Temecula, CA).

gift by Dr. Huda Y. Zoghbi (Baylor College of Medicine). Site-directed mutagenesis was per-
formed on the pCAG-HA-NMNAT2 backbone using a Quik-ChangeII Site-Directed Muta-
genesis kit (Agilent, Santa Clara CA). The sequences of primers used for mutagenesis are listed

expression cassette-IRES-EGFP driven by the elongation factor-1 (EF-1) promoter within the
AV4-EF1-GFP shuttle plasmid as described [32].
CS Aggregation Assay
The CS aggregation assay was performed as described previously [67]. Substrate CS (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) was desalted and mixed with either egg white lysozyme (Sigma), NMNAT1/2/3
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or HSP70 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at varying
concentrations in HEPES (pH 7.4) buffer for 30 min. To generate recombinant NMNAT2 pro-
teins, the coding sequences were cloned into pET28b vector for bacterial expressions. The
recombinant proteins of NMNAT2 and its variants were prepared by the MD Anderson Prote-
omic Core. Aggregation of denatured CS was initiated at 43°C and was monitored as Raleigh
scattering absorbance at 360 nm as a function of time. A FluoStar Optima plate reader (BMG
Labtech, Cary, NC) was used for absorbance measurements. The relative chaperone activity of
NMNAT was calculated as the scattering of CS aggregates with time versus NMNAT
concentration.
CS Refolding Assay
The refolding assay of chemically denatured CS was performed as described previously [100].
Briefly, the concentration of desalted CS was measured at A280 (for CS, A280(0.1%) = 1.78).
1 μM CS was denatured in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 1 M Tris-HCl (pH = 8) and 50 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1.5 hours at 25°C. Renaturation of aggregated CS was initiated by add-
ing 0.5 M ATP and 1 μM of respective chaperones and studied by measuring light scattering at
360 nm as a function of time. A FluoStar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC) was
used for absorbance measurements.

 Luciferase Aggregation Assay
The luciferase aggregation assay was performed as described [101,102], with a few modifica-
tions. Cos7 cells were transfected with pCMV-cytLuciferase and one of the following plasmids:
pCMV-HSP70, pCMV-NMNAT1, pCMV-NMNAT3, pCAG-mCherry, HA-NMNAT2,
HA-NMNAT2W92G(ED), HA-NMNAT2C164S/C165S (PM), HA-NMNAT2ΔNT, HA-NM-
NAT2ΔCT, or HA-NMNAT2ΔcATP, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). 48 h
post-transfection, the cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (50
ug/mL for 3 h). One batch of cells was lysed immediately with luciferase lysis buffer (Promega,
Madison, WI), while two similar batches were heat-shocked at 42°C for 15 min (which induced
efficient unfolding of luciferase without killing the cells). Second batch of cells was lysed imme-
diately after heat shock, while the final batch was allowed to recover at 37°C for 3 h. Luciferase
activity was measured with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega).
NAD/NADH Enzymatic Assay
NMNAT enzyme activity was measured using Amplite Colorimetric Total NAD and NADH
Assay Kit (AAT Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA). Briefly, Cos7 cells overexpressing different NMNAT
isoforms and mutants were lysed 48 h post transfection using manufacturer’s protocol. For mea-
suring NAD levels from hippocampi, tissue was extracted in the lysis buffer provided in the kit
and NAD was measured using 50 ug total protein per reaction. NAD/NADH levels were mea-
sured using supplied standards using an absorbance microplate reader at ~576 nm.
ATPase Activity Assay
The ATPase activity of NMNAT2 variants and HSP90 was measured with or without aggre-
gated CS using the EnzCheck Phosphate Assay kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).
Briefly, this spectrophotometric microplate-based assay detects a change in absorbance from
330 nm to 360 nm, when the 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside (MESG) substrate
is converted by the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) enzyme to the ribose MESG prod-
uct, in the presence of inorganic phosphate. The reactions were performed in a 96-well plate, in
the presence of 500 mM ATP and either 1 mM NMNAT2-WT, -ΔcATP or HSP90, in the
absence or presence of denatured CS. Measurements were made after 5 min of incubation
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
In Vitro p-hTau Assay
Inducible tau stable Trex-293 cell lines expressing human 2N4R tau (hTau40) were a gift from
Dr. Jeff Kuret [77]. To maintain stably-transfected cells containing the Tau transgene, these
were cultured in selective medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Cells were transfected
with pCMV-mCherry, HSP70, HA-NMNAT2, HA-NMNAT2-ED, HA-NMNAT2-PM,
HA-NMNAT2-ΔNT, HA-NMNAT2-ΔCT or HA-NMNAT2-ΔcATP using Lipofectamine. 6 h
post transfection, Tau expression was induced by adding 1 μg/mL tetracycline (Sigma) to cell
culture media. 48 h postinduction, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer to extract total protein,
which was assayed for PHF-1 levels using western blotting.
Cos7 Cell Line Experiments
HA-NMNAT2 was expressed in Cos7 cells using lipofectamine. 48 h post transfection, cells
were treated with DMSO or 10 μM MG132 for 12 h. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and pro-
tein concentration assayed using the Bradford method. 1 mg total protein was used as the start-
ing material for immunoprecipitation with HA-antibody or HSP90 antibody. Mouse IgG was

 used as a negative control in the experiment. Immunoprecipitates were probed with specific
antibodies to reveal protein–protein interactions.
Mice
The generation and genotyping of rTg(tauP301L)4510 (rTg4510) and NMNAT2-Blad mice
have been described previously [18,76]. rTg4510 mice over-express the P301L mutation in
4R0N human tau associated with FTDP-17 [76]. NMNAT2 null mutation was generated by
transposon-mediated gene-trap mutagenesis [18]. Animal housing and use were in compliance
with the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by
the institutional animal care committee at Baylor College of Medicine and Indiana University.
Stereotactic Injection of Recombinant Adeno-associated Virus Carrying
GFP or NMNAT2 or NMNAT2 Variants into Adult Mice
To quantitatively compare the in vivo efficacy of NMNAT2 and its variants in reducing toxic
tau species, we overexpressed GFP, and NMNAT2-WT, -ED, -ΔcATP in the hippocampi of
6-wk-old rTg4510 mice through rAAV. Serotype 6 rAAVs carrying cDNA’s of NMNAT2-WT,
-ED, or -ΔcATP were prepared by cloning into the expression cassette-IRES-EGFP driven by
the EF-1 promoter within the AV4-EF1-GFP shuttle as described [32]. GFP-rAAV was also
generated as control rAAV. 1 μl rAAV-NMNAT2-WT, -ED, -ΔcATP, or 1 μl of rAAV-EGFP
(108 particles per μl) was injected into the CA1/dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus in one
hemisphere (control mice: n = 6 for GFP, n = 2 per NMNAT2-WT, -ED, and ΔcATP; rTg4510
mice: n = 6 for GFP, n = 6 for NMNAT2-WT, n = 5 for -ED, and n = 6 for ΔcATP) at the fol-
lowing coordinates measured from bregma: A: 2 mm, L: 1–1.5 mm, V: 1.2 mm (tooth bar set at
zero). The efficacy of these rAAVs on toxic tau clearance were quantitatively evaluated with
immunostaining and western blotting using the tissue prepared from GFP-AAV and
NMNAT2 or NMNAT2 variants-AAV-transduced hippocampi of rTg4510 mice at 1 mo
postinjection.
Immunohistochemistry and MC1 Quantification in rTg4510
Hippocampus
One month after rAAV injections, rTg4510 and control mice were deeply anesthetized, trans-
cardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in PBS, after
which the brains were removed and postfixed overnight in 4% PFA. The brains were serially
sectioned in the coronal plane into 50 μm thick sections using a Leica VT-1000 vibrating
microtome (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL). Brain slices containing comparative com-
plete hippocampal morphology were selected and stained with MC-1 antibody (recognize
pathological conformation of hTau, a generous gift from Peter Davies, Feinstein Institute for
Medical Research, Manhasset, NY; 1:500), HA-antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA) and DAPI (nuclear stain). For quantitative analysis of MC1-positive neurons in the hip-
pocampus, we imaged areas enriched with HA-positive pyramidal neurons in the CA1 and
quantified HA and MC1-immunoreactivity in the striatum pyramidale layer using NIH ImageJ
software, as described previously [103].
Immunocytochemistry for Cultured Neurons
Cortical neurons were prepared from E16.5 NMNAT2 WT, HET, or KO embryos and cultured
on Poly-D-Lysine coated coverslips. DIV10 neurons were fixed with 4% PFA and 3% Sucrose
in PBS and immunostained for synaptic markers Synaptophysin (1/1,000, Millipore, Temecula,

 CA), and VGlut1 (1/500 (1/1,000, Synaptic Systems, GmbH, Germany), the axonal marker
ßIII-Tubulin (1/1,000, Millipore, Temecula, CA) and MAP2 (1/2,000, Millipore, Temecula,
CA) as described [104,105]. Cells were imaged using fluorescent Alexa Fluor 555, 488, and 647
conjugated antibodies, with a Leica TCS SPE personal confocal.
Neuronal Cultures and MTT Assay
Cortical neurons were prepared from the cortices of E16.5 embryos from NMNAT2 wild type,
heterozygous, or homozygous [18] using the Worthington Papain Dissociation Kit (LK003153,
Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ). 50,000 neurons were plated per well in
polylysine-D coated 96-well plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) in Neurobasal media
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY). Following plating, half of the media was replenished with B-27 and
L-glutamine supplemented fresh Neurobasal media on Days-in-Vitro (DIV2), DIV7 and
DIV14 and DIV18. Neurons were treated with prior to treatment with MG132 (10 μM) or
DMSO (control) on DIV14 for 12 h. For KCL treatment, neurons were treated at DIV5, 10, 15,
or 20 with 30 mM KCl for 24 h. Following either treatment, the MTT assay was performed as
described [106]. MTT assay measures cell viability based upon the ability of viable cells to
reduce the tetrazolium dye MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bro-
mide to its insoluble form formazan [88]. MTT assay was performed on primary cortical neu-
rons grown in 96-well plates, using Vybrant MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit, according to
manufacturer’s guidelines (Life Technologies). The absorbance values for cells treated with
MTT were measured using the 540 nm wavelength, Opsys MR spectrophotometer, and Revela-
tion Quicklink software.
Lentiviral Transduction in Cortical Neuronal Culture
Wild type NMNAT2, ED, PM, and cATP deletion mutants were cloned into LV provided by
the DERC Gene Vector Core at BCM. These LV vectors were concentrated by ultracentrifuga-
tion and supplied at roughly 1 x 105 tu/uL. Neurons plated at a concentration of 100K/mL onto
Poly-D-Lysine coated coverslips in 24-well plates or 96-well plates for MTT assay, were
infected on DIV2 with 1 uL (105) LV particles to transduce almost all the neurons plated. For
imaging, coverslips were either fixed at DIV5 or DIV10 with 4%PFA+ 3%Sucrose solution and
processed for immunostaining (see below).
Coimmunoprecipitation
Heads from approximately 5 ml of Transgenic flies carrying P{w[+mW.hs] = GAL4-da.G32}
UH1; UAS-HA:Nmnat [1] were homogenized in a dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer contain-
ing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT and prote-
ase and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The resulting supernatant
was collected without centrifugation after 5 min settling on ice and used for coimmunoprecipi-
tation using Sigma Ezview Red Anti-HA affinity gel along with the supplied protocol. Bound
proteins were eluted using Sigma HA peptide at 100 ug/ml.
Mass Spectrometry Analysis
The mass spectrometry analysis was performed in the Mass Spectrometry-Proteomics Core
Facility in Baylor College of Medicine. Two microliter aliquots of each sample were quantified
using NanoOrange protein quantification kit (Invitrogen). All samples were normalized to one
microgram per 100 μL with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.9). The samples were
reduced with 100 mM DTT (BioRad) in a rotary shaker at 800 rpm at room temperature for 30

 min. The reduced cysteine residues were further treated with 400 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma)
in the dark at room temperature for 30 min in the same shaker. 40 ng of sequencing grade tryp-
sin (Sigma) were added to the samples for digestion. The digests were supplemented with ace-
tonitrile to 10% of total volume. The digestion was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 16 h by mild
shaking. Digestion was stopped by the addition of formic acid to 5% final volume and tubes
were Speedvac dried. Digests were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid and 5% acetonitrile solu-
tion. The concentration of each digest was measured using NanoOrange and 200 ng of each
sample was fed into the Eksigent nanoLC system. The Ekisgent nanoLC and the ABCIEX Tri-
pleTOF 5,600 mass spectrometer were controlled by Analyst software, version 1.6 (ABCIEX
Inc., Framingham, MA).
The Eksigent nanoLC system has a cHiPLC system. The chips contained a trap column
(200 μm × 0.5 mm, ChromXP C18-CL, 3 μm, 120Å) that trapped the injected peptides in a
flow rate of 3 uL/min in a buffer composed of 50% of 0.1% formic acid and 50% of acetonitrile
for 5 min at 23°C. The second section was an analytical column (75 μm × 15 cm, ChromXP
C18-CL, 3 μm, 120 Å) with an organic mobile phase gradient set at a 90 min gradient starting
from 5 to 35% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The acetonitrile
concentration was increased to 80% in 5 min and then held in 80% acetonitrile for an addi-
tional 5 min. The final acetonitrile concentration was reduced to 5% within 5 min and then the
column was equilibrated for 20 min to prepare for the next sample.
The Eksigent nanoLC was linked via the nanoflex to the ABCIEX TripleTOF 5600 mass
spectrometer. The spray tip was the PicoTip emitter (360 μm OD, 20 μm ID, 12 cm long with
10 μm tip opening size) from New Objective. The GS 1 gas was set at 3 units and the curtain
gas was set at 24 units. The ionization voltage was set at 2,400 V. The interface heater tempera-
ture was set at 150°C. The MS precursor ions were selected from 400 to 1,250 amu. The cycle
time was 0.25 s and the forty most abundant ions were allowed to pass to the q2 for product
ion production. The MS/MS spectra were acquired at 0.1 second at the m/z range of 100 to
2,000. A beta-galactosidase tryptic digest was used as a calibration standard every sixth run.
Raw WIFF files were fed into Protein Pilot version 4.5 (Paragon-based) software (ABCIEX
Inc.) for peak generation and database search with <10% false discovery rate. The organism
was set as Drosophila and the database was the NCBI nonredundant database.
Ataxin-1 Aggregation Assay
The ataxin-1 aggregation assay was performed as described [87]. Briefly, Cos7 cells were dou-
bly transfected with either pEGFP-hAtaxtn-1[82Q] and pCAG-mCherry, HA-NMNAT2,
HA-NMNAT2W92G (ED), HA-NMNAT2C164S/C165S (PM), HA-NMNAT2ΔNT, HA-NM-
NAT2ΔCT or HA-NMNAT2ΔcATP using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were fixed
and immunolabelled to detect HA-tagged NMNATs. Cell nuclei were labeled with DAPI
(Molecular Probes, Grand Island, NY). The size of GFP-positive aggregates was measured
using Neurolucida software.
To distinguish between soluble and insoluble ataxin, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50
mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1%
SDS, 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Branford, CT) and fractionated
according to an established protocol [87]. The detergent-soluble fraction was defined as pro-
teins remaining in the supernatant after centrifugation of the cell lysates at 120,000 g for 15
min. After removal of the supernatant, the pellets were washed with RIPA buffer and then sus-
pended in 2% SDS Buffer. One assumption made in this assay was that all cells transfected
would have likely chance of incorporating both pEGFP-hAtaxin-1[82Q] and the test chaperone
protein.

 Immunofluorescence Staining and Imaging for Cultured Cells
Immunofluorescence staining was performed on cultured cells. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA for
20 min and washed with PBS/0.01% Triton X-100 (PBST) and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton
X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 5 min. Next, blocking was performed for 1 h using 5%
normal goat serum in PBS. Following this step, the cells were stained for the HA-tag (1:1,000,
Cell Signaling) diluted in PBST/1% normal goat serum at 4°C overnight. The next day, cells
were washed with PBST, and incubated with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse 594 secondary
antibodies (all at 1/500, Invitrogen) in PBST at room temperature for 2 h. Following this incu-
bation, cells were washed with PBST three times for 10 min each and mounted in Vectashield
mounting media with DAPI (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and cover slipped for imaging.
Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss AxioImager M1 system equipped with
epifluorescence filters, a Zeiss monochrome digital camera and AxioVision software. All
images were processed in Adobe Photoshop for brightness/contrast, orientation and back-
ground correction to better illustrate staining patterns.
Statistics
Means were compared across groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for � three
groups or t-tests for two groups for data with normal distribution that met variance homogene-
ity. Significance was assessed using the Tukey criterion for pairwise mean comparisons under
the ANOVA model. Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. When
homogeneity of variance was not met under the ANOVA model, a robust ANOVA was carried
out. Two-tailed p-values <0.05 were considered significant. Values are expressed as
mean ± SE. Computations were carried out using Graphpad Prism for Windows, version 6.0
(La Jolla, CA).

S1 Fig. NMNAT2 levels are reduced in AD and nondemented AD neuropathology (NDAN)
brains collected by the Oregon Health Center. Both qPCR and western analysis were con-
ducted to determine the levels of nmnat2 mRNA and protein in postmortem human brains
from control and NDAN groups as well as AD patients. NDAN group had normal cognitive
function but possessed the same levels of plaque and tangle burden as AD patients (Braak stage
of IV through VI and CERAD rating of moderate to frequent; please see S3 Table for individual
subjects) [107,108], suggesting that NDAN subjects are resistant to or have extraordinarily
delayed the onset of cognitive decline that normally accompanies the progression of fully
symptomatic AD. Comparing NDAN to AD cases is a way to shed light on mechanisms that
are selectively involved in AD-related cognitive decline. (A) The levels of nmnat1/2 mRNA in
postmortem human brains from control (n = 5) and NDAN (n = 6) groups as well as AD
patients (n = 6) were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The levels of mRNA for both
genes were normalized to GAPDH and 18s mRNA loading controls. We found a significant
reduction in nmnat2 mRNA levels in NDAN and an even greater decline in AD brains. There
was no change of nmnat1 abundance in NDAN or AD groups. (B) Quantification of

 NMNAT2 protein levels in soluble fractions from Control, NDAN and AD brains reveals a
reduction in NMNAT2 levels in NDAN and AD, consistent with the decreased mRNA level.
The majority of proteins extracted from these human brain samples is present in the soluble
fraction, which extracts both soluble and membrane bound proteins. Comparatively, a very
small fraction of proteins, comprised mainly of aggregated pathological species and proteins
bound to such species appear in the insoluble fraction (approximately 1/100 of the total
amount present in the soluble fraction) [109]. Error bars represent SEM. The differential
reduction of NMNAT2 in NDAN and AD suggests that the reduction of NMNAT2 below a
threshold contributes to cognitive decline in AD. �p<0.05, ��p < 0.01, ���p < 0.001 when com-

S2 Fig. Mammalian NMNATs act as chaperones to refold and prevent heat-denatured lucif-
erase aggregation. Mammalian NMNATs act as chaperones to refold and prevent heat-dena-
tured luciferase aggregation. Cos7 cells were transfected with cytoplasmic luciferase together
with either mCherry, human NMNAT1, 2 or 3 or HSP70. In this assay, heat denaturation
along with the protein-synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, renders the endogenous chaperone
machinery incapable of preventing luciferase aggregation and recovery post stress, allowing for
the chaperone activity of an introduced test protein to be directly measured. The cells express-
ing luciferase and various proteins were briefly heated at 45°C (heat shock), returned to 37°C
and the luciferase activity was compared before and after heat shock to assess the ability of test
proteins to protect luciferase from heat shock-induced denaturation (holdase activity) and to
promote proper refolding of heat-denatured luciferase during recovery (foldase activity). Sum-
mary shows that the presence of HSP70 or NMNATs 1, 2, and 3 reduced the aggregation of
luciferase post heat shock and promoted refolding of the aggregated luciferase during the
recovery phase (3 independent experiments with triplicate in each experiment). Blue bars show
baseline luciferase activity. Red bars show luciferase activity immediately after 15 min 42°C
heat shock while blue bars show luciferase activity after 3 hours of post-heat shock recovery.

S3 Fig. NMNATs act as molecular chaperones. (A) Example data from an in vitro chaperone
activity assay. In this assay, recombinant CS is induced to aggregate with thermal stress, and
the aggregation process quantified by Rayleigh scattering of the CS homoaggregates versus
time. CS was incubated with Lysozyme (negative control), HSP70 (positive control), or human
NMNAT1-3 for 30 min. Aggregation of CS was induced at 43°C and monitored as absorbance
at 350 nm over time. Decreased absorbance corresponds to less aggregation, which could result
from a protein binding to CS and stabilizing it to protect it from aggregation. Incubation of CS
with increasing amounts of purified recombinant hNMNAT1, 2, 3, or HSP70 resulted in a con-
comitant decrease in substrate aggregation after thermal denaturation in a dose-dependent
manner. At the same time, lysozyme did not have any effect on CS aggregation. This assay
reveals the holdase activity of HSP70 and NMNAT1-3, by which they can bind to aggregation-
prone substrates and keep them in a stable phase to prevent aggregation. (B) Summary show-
ing that CS aggregation was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by recombinant HSP70,
NMNAT1, 2, or 3, but not lysozyme. The potency of human NMNAT1–3 to decrease substrate
denaturation was similar to that of HSP70, a well-studied chaperone. Raw data can be found in

 S4 Fig. Enzymatic and stability properties of NMNAT2 variants. (A) Enzyme activity of WT
and various NMNAT2 mutants, in Cos7 cells, as measured by NAD and NADH levels (n = 3
experiments). ED and ΔNT show similar NAD/NADH levels as the mCherry control, proving
that these constructs are indeed enzymatically inactive. PM is more stable and correspondingly
shows more enzymatic activity. ΔCT and ΔcATP mutants exhibit similar enzymatic functions
as WT NMNAT2. (B) NAD levels in hippocampus after 1 mo postinjection of AAV overex-
pressing GFP or NMNAT2-WT, -ED, or -ΔcATP. Clearly, overexpressing -ED does not
increase NAD levels as seen with -WT or -ΔcATP. (C) The stability of WT and mutant
NMNAT2 was measured in Cos7 cells treated with 10 μM cycloheximide for 4 h (n = 3 inde-
pendent experiments). Among NMNATs, NMNAT2 is the most labile, with a half-life less
than 2 h [15,16]. Deleting the central domain or mutating the palmitoylation sites (C164 and
165) in this domain significantly increases NMNAT2’s stability [17]. The N- and C-terminal
domains of NMNAT2 are highly conserved with those of NMNAT1 and 3, while its central
domain is unique [68]. Deleting the N or C-terminal domain (ΔNT and ΔCT) had no impact
on NMNAT2 stability. The half-lives of NMNAT- ED mutant, the C-terminal ATP site dele-
tion (ΔcATP) mutant, and NMNAT2-WT were all similar. � indicate significant differences

S5 Fig. NMNAT2 appears in the insoluble fraction in rTg4510 cortex, complexing with
Tau and HSP90. (A) In the rTg4510 tauopathy model, where FTD-linked mutant human Tau
is overexpressed in the forebrain from 1 mo of age. Neurodegeneration phenotypes in this
mouse line become evident from 2.5 mo of age [110]. In this model, tau hyperphosphorylation
is observed from 2.5 mo of age [111] and increases with age. NMNAT2 shifts solubility in
6-mo-old rTg4510 brains and a substantial fraction of NMNAT2 became insoluble, colocaliz-
ing with tau oligomers and HSP90 in the insoluble fraction, while in control brains almost no
NMNAT2 was found in the insoluble fraction. A similar change in HSP90 solubility was
observed in human AD cortices, but not in control. (B) Previously, we reported that
NMNAT2 levels decline in this model as early as 1 mo of age, preceding the onset of neurode-
generation or behavioral impairments. When we investigated when NMNAT2 protein shifts
solubility NMNAT2 in this model, we observed that this occurs simultaneously as Tau
becomes insoluble. rTg4510 cortices, where P301L-mutant human Tau was overexpressed
with a neuronal CAMKII promoter, were harvested at age 1 and 3 mo. In young mice, where
hTau insolubility had not occurred, NMNAT2 was only detected in the soluble fraction. How-
ever, at 3 mo of age, NMNAT2 became insoluble, with hTau insoluble oligomers detected by
AT8 Ab. AT8 Ab detects hTau phosphorylated at Ser202 and Thr 205 [112]. At this same
time point, NMNAT2 levels were reduced in the soluble fraction. Total tubulin was used as a
loading control.

S6 Fig. NMNAT2’s C-terminal domain is required to complex with HSP90. (A) In this sta-
ble cell line, 2N4R tau (hTau40) is overexpressed when doxycycline (1 μg/mL) is added to the
media [77]. Over time, hyperphosphorylated Tau forms and aggregates. 24 h after inducing
hTau expression, HA-NMNAT2 was overexpressed in these cells. 48 h post transfection, the
cells were lysed and HA-tagged proteins immunoprecipitated from the soluble fraction. Immu-
noprecipitation of HA-tagged NMNAT2 from soluble lysates of hTau40 stable cell line reveals
efficient pull down of all NMNAT2 variants. HSP90 was immunoprecipitated with all but the
C-terminal NMNAT2 deletion mutant. (B) The interaction between HSP90 and NMNAT2 in

S7 Fig. Inhibiting or reducing HSP90 function increases luciferase activity after heat shock
and following the recovery phase. During basal conditions (nonstressed), HSP90 binds to
HSF1 and p23-immunophilins [83]. This complex prevents HSF1 from forming homo trimers
and activating the transcription of the heat shock response genes (Fig 4C) [83]. Hence, reduc-
tion or inhibition of HSP90 by treating the cells with siRNA or 17-AAG promotes the heat
shock response by increasing free HSF1 and HSP transcription. Here, we found that reducing
HSP90 activity lessened luciferase aggregation and promoted refolding post heat shock in
mCherry-expressing cells. Such an effect is likely to arise from overactivation of HSF1 upon
inhibition of HSP90. Indeed, coapplication of KRI, which blocks HSF1 recruitment to Heat
Shock Elements [86], reversed the effects of blocking HSP90 on luciferase refolding. Bar graph

ments. Experiments were repeated four times in triplicate. � indicates p < 0.05 when compared

S8 Fig. NMNAT2’s interaction with HSP90 activates its ATPase activity. (A) ATPase activity
of NMNAT2 was measured after 5 min of incubation with reactants in the presence of 500 uM
ATP. NMNATs catalyze the condensation of ATP with NMN to form NAD and pyrophosphate
(PPi). However, this assay only detects the release of inorganic phosphate. To test the enzyme
efficacy of the NMNATs, we added pyrophosphatase that will release inorganic phosphate from
pyrophosphate. In the presence of aggregated CS, NMNAT2 lacks ATPase activity. However,
addition of pyrophosphatase yields inorganic phosphate in this reaction when NMN is present
(red), showing that our protein is enzymatically active. (B) When we add HSP90 with
NMNAT2 and aggregated CS, we activate NMNAT2’s ATPase activity, which can be estimated
by subtracting the Pi released in this ATPase reaction from that containing only HSP90 (last
blue bar on right). Experiments were repeated three times. ��p < 0.001, ���p < 0.0001 respec-

S9 Fig. NMNAT2:HSP90 complexing hydrolyzes ATP at the C-terminus ATP site. Mutat-
ing NMNAT2 to the ΔcATP mutant abolishes the ATPase activity of NMNAT2 in the presence
of HSP90. Note, the blue bars with ΔcATP+HSP90 are similar to those with just HSP90 in the
reaction. This suggests that ATP bound to the C-terminal ATP site of NMNAT2 in the pres-
ence of aggregated substrates is only hydrolyzed when NMNAT2 complexes with HSP90.
