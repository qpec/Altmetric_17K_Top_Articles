Abstract
An emerging approach for treating cancer involves programming patient-derived T cells with 
genes encoding disease-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), so that they can combat 
tumour cells once they are reinfused. Although trials of this therapy have produced impressive 
results, the in vitro methods they require to generate large numbers of tumour-specific T cells are 
too elaborate for widespread application to treat cancer patients. Here, we describe a method to 
quickly program circulating T cells with tumour-recognizing capabilities, thus avoiding these 
complications. Specifically, we demonstrate that DNA-carrying nanoparticles can efficiently 
introduce leukaemia-targeting CAR genes into T-cell nuclei, thereby bringing about long-term 
disease remission. These polymer nanoparticles are easy to manufacture in a stable form, which 
simplifies storage and reduces cost. Our technology may therefore provide a practical, broadly

 applicable treatment that can generate anti-tumour immunity ‘on demand’ for oncologists in a 
variety of settings.
Despite the obvious advantages afforded by targeted T-cell therapies (compared with the 
blunt instruments of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery), the complex procedures and costs 
involved in producing genetically modified lymphocytes remain major obstacles for 
implementing them as standard-of-care in the treatment of cancer1,2. Currently, clinical-
scale manufacturing of T lymphocytes requires an assortment of elaborate protocols to 
isolate, genetically modify, and selectively expand the redirected cells before infusing them 
back into the patient. Because these difficult procedures entail dedicated equipment and 
considerable technical expertise, they can only be performed at a few specialized centres 
worldwide. Given the challenges this disease already poses to our healthcare system, 
providing personalized T-cell therapy to the more than 1.5 million new patients diagnosed 
just in the United States each year is not practical.
Nanotechnology could solve this problem by making available inexpensive DNA carriers 
that can quickly and specifically program tumour-recognizing capabilities into T cells as 
they circulate within the patient (Supplementary Fig. 1). Here, we demonstrate that once 
they are adapted with lymphocyte-targeting ligands, polymeric nanocarriers can selectively 
deliver leukaemia-specific CAR genes into host T cells in situ. When administered under the 
correct conditions, these particles can program T cells in quantities that are sufficient to 
bring about tumour regression with efficacies that are similar to conventional infusions of T 
cells transduced ex vivo with CAR-encoding viral vectors. We found that nanoparticle-
reprogrammed T cells continue to produce these receptors for weeks, allowing them to act as 
a ‘living drug’ that increases in number, serially destroys tumour cells, and ultimately 
differentiate into long-lived memory T cells.
Designing nanocarriers to achieve CAR expression in T cells
To achieve effective nucleic acid delivery into T cells, gene carriers must (i) be taken up by 
T cells and (ii) import their DNA cargo into the cell nucleus. Our first step was to couple T-
cell-targeting anti-CD3e f(ab′)2 fragments to the surfaces of biodegradable poly (β-amino 
ester)-based nanoparticles3, which selectively enabled their receptor-mediated endocytosis 
by lymphocytes (Fig. 1a). To achieve requirement (ii), we functionalized the polymer with 
peptides containing microtubule-associated sequences (MTAS) and nuclear localization 
signals (NLS), as a means to facilitate fast-track nuclear import of their genetic cargo via the 
microtubule transport machinery4.
We furnished these targeted nanoparticles with anticancer programming capabilities by 
loading them with plasmid DNA encoding the leukaemia-specific 194-1BBz CAR (ref. 5), 
which is a fusion receptor composed of a single-chain antibody (scFv) specific for the 
extracellular domain of the CD19 leukaemia antigen, combined with 4-1BB and CD3ζ 
cytoplasmic signalling domains. To conduct our studies in immunocompetent mice, we used 
an all-murine CAR that is equivalent to one that is the focus of current clinical trials6. We 
achieved persistent CAR expression in actively dividing T cells by flanking our gene 
expression cassette with piggyBac inverted terminal repeats; these transposons are mobile

 genetic elements that efficiently integrate vectors into chromosomes via a cut-and-paste 
mechanism7, an event that is mediated by the piggyBac transposase enzyme. To enable this 
integration, we co-encapsulated a plasmid encoding a hyperactive form of the transposase 
(iPB7)8 into the carriers.
The nanoparticles were manufactured by mixing the reactants at a polymer:DNA ratio of 30 
(w/w) in aqueous conditions, which condenses plasmid DNA into nanosized complexes (Fig. 
1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). These were targeted towards T cells by coupling polyglutamic 
acid to anti-CD3e f(ab′)2, forming a conjugate that was electrostatically adsorbed to the 
particles. The resulting DNA nanocarriers were 155 ± 40 nm in size and −7.8 ± 2.1 mV in 
zeta potential, and could be lyophilized prior to use with no change in properties or efficacy 
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2).
CAR-programming of cultured T cells via DNA nanocarriers
We first assessed the ability of the engineered nanoparticles to program specificities against 
leukaemia by incubating mouse splenocytes with the particles at various ratios. We found 
that CD3-targeted nanoparticles selectively bind T lymphocytes, as their interactions with 
off-target cells were low (Fig. 2a). Confocal imaging established that the particles are 
rapidly (120 min) internalized into the cytoplasm, presumably as a result of receptor-induced 
endocytosis (Fig. 2b). As early as 30 h post-transfection, 194-1BBz receptors were detected 
on the surfaces of the treated cells (mean 3.8% CAR+ T cells ± 0.3%, nanoparticle:T cell 
ratio = 3 × 103:1; Fig. 2c). Gene transfer greatly benefited from the use of poly(beta-amino 
ester) (PBAE) polymer that had been functionalized with the MTAS and NLS sequences, as 
in their absence nuclear targeting of CAR-transgene expression in primary T cells was 
substantially lower (mean 1.1 ± 0.2%; Fig. 2d). Nanoparticle-transfected lymphocytes were 
fully functional, as they selectively lysed Eμ-ALL01 leukaemia cells and secreted effector 
cytokines at levels similar to T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding the same 
CAR (Fig. 2e–g). Exposure of T cells to anti-CD3e f(ab′)2 on the surfaces of the 
nanoparticles resulted in only a mild T-cell stimulation compared with untargeted particles, 
and did not induce unresponsiveness to antigen restimulation (Supplementary Fig. 3). 
Incorporating piggyBac transposable elements into nanoparticle-delivered plasmids 
maintained high-level 194-1BBz gene expression in T cells over many days as a result of 
somatic integration (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 4).
In vivo T-cell targeting and reprogramming
Our goal is to selectively edit lymphocyte targeting in vivo to bring about the regression of 
cancer; accordingly, we next examined how exclusively CD3-mediated targeting confined 
nanoparticle interactions to circulating T cells by systemically injecting mice with 3 × 1011 
functionalized, DNA-free nanoparticles that we fluorescently tagged. Flow cytometry of 
peripheral blood collected 4 h later established that 34% (±5.1%) of the circulating T 
lymphocytes bound CD3-targeted nanoparticles, whilst signals from offtarget cells in 
peripheral blood were low (5.9 ± 2.8%; Fig. 3a). A more detailed phenotypic analysis 
revealed that neutrophils, monocytes and B cells were among the more prominent subtypes 
that non-specifically bound injected CD3-targeted nanoparticles, although particles were

 also detected on small numbers of natural killer (NK) cells and eosinophils (Fig. 3a, lower 
panel, that is, the horizontal bar in the middle showing the different cell populations). As in 
vitro, confocal microscopy of sorted T cells confirmed the rapid internalization of bound 
nanoparticles from the cell surface (Fig. 3a, right panel). As in vitro means that the confocal 
picture shown in the right panel of Fig. 3a show the same process (receptor-mediated 
internalization of nanoparticles by T cells) as Fig. 2b (in vitro experiments). The difference 
in Fig. 3 compared to Fig. 2 is that in Fig. 3 nanoparticles were injected intravenously into 
mice and taken up in vivo whereas in Fig. 2 nanoparticles were directly incubated with T 
cells in vitro. The right panel refers to the confocal image of T cells with incorporated 
nanoparticles. Infused nanoparticles were taken up by all CD3-expressing T-cell 
subpopulations, including CD4+ and CD8+ naive, effector and memory cells, in numbers 
reflecting their respective physiological ratios in peripheral blood (Fig. 3b). In parallel 
experiments, we quantified the distribution of nanoparticles in various organs 4 h after 
intravenous injection. The highest concentrations of non-targeted particles were found in the 
liver, whilst lymphocyte-targeted nanocarriers accumulated mainly in the spleen, lymph 
nodes and bone marrow (Fig. 3c,d).
Guided by the distribution data, we next measured potential in vivo toxicities of the 
lymphocyte-targeted nanocarriers. These experiments were conducted using nanoparticles 
loaded with P4-1BBz genes (which encode a CAR specific for human prostate-specific 
membrane antigen9) instead of those encoding the 194-1BBz CAR, thereby ensuring that 
any changes in the parameters we measured (for example, blood levels of cytokines) could 
be attributed to the nanocarriers per se rather than their reprogramming activity. Mice were 
injected with five daily doses of 3 × 1011 nanoparticles, or phosphate-buffered saline as a 
control. Gross examinations and histopathology performed 24 h after the final dose revealed 
no treatment-related macro- or microscopic lesions (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c). Cell counts 
and blood chemistry profiles also revealed no abnormalities, indicating that systemic 
toxicities did not occur (Supplementary Fig. 5d). In addition, nanoparticle treatments caused 
only modest increases in the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (interferon 
gamma: 1.6-fold, P = 0.51, non-significant (ns) (P >0.05); interleukin-12: 1.3-fold, P = 
0.015* (* means significant); interleukin-6: 2.5-fold, P = 0.01*; Supplementary Fig. 5d).
To determine if the targeted nanoparticles can reprogram circulating T cells with leukaemia-
specific CAR genes in situ, we intravenously injected mice bearing B-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia with five sequential doses of 3 × 1011 nanoparticles engineered to 
deliver transgenes encoding the 194-1BBz CAR. One treatment group received 
nanoparticles carrying the CAR transgene only, and a second group was injected with 
particles co-delivering the CAR transgene with plasmids encoding iPB7 transposase, which 
mediates efficient integration of nanoparticle-delivered CAR transposons into the genome of 
transfected T cells. A third group of mice received nanoparticles loaded with tumour-
irrelevant P4-1BBz genes, and controls received no treatment. We found that only bolus 
injections of nanoparticles co-delivering 194-1BBz and iPB7 transgenes rapidly and 
efficiently programmed peripheral T cells to recognize leukaemia cells (mean 5.8% CAR+ 
among CD3+ ± 0.9% on day 6; Fig. 4a). Following transfection, these lymphocytes 
underwent robust proliferation (5.5-fold, day 12) while maintaining high-level expression of 
the CAR transgene (mean 7.1% CAR+ among CD3+ ± 1.7% on day 24). Following a

 contraction period, nanoparticle-programmed effector T cells acquired a CD44high CD62L+ 
memory phenotype (Fig. 4a). Expansion of 194-1BBz-programmed T cells was dependent 
on their interaction with tumour antigens, as lymphocytes programmed with P4-1BBz CARs 
failed to proliferate and gradually declined to undetectable levels by day 12. Also, stable 
integration of the 194-1BBz transposon into the genome of transfected T cells was required 
to yield relevant numbers of CAR T cells, as T cells transfected with CAR-encoding 
nanoparticles carrying transgenes without the piggyBac elements failed to expand, even in 
the presence of abundant tumour antigen (Fig. 4a).
To measure the dynamics of nanoparticle-mediated programming of circulating T cells, we 
injected mice with particles carrying plasmids that co-express the click beetle red luciferase 
(CBR-luc) reporter along with CAR genes. Using bioluminescence imaging, we found that 
the initial signal in mice receiving treatments encoding 194-1BBz (+iPB7) was concentrated 
in the spleen area as early as 3 days after nanoparticle administration (Fig. 4b). This signal 
subsequently became systemic, spreading to areas of the bone marrow and lymph nodes 
while increasing in intensity (to a maximum of 41-fold on day 12; Fig. 4c). By contrast, we 
could detect only a weak bioluminescence signal at day 3 in mice injected either with 
194-1BBz- (no iPB7 transposase) or P4-1BBz-programming nanoparticles, which gradually 
declined to near-background levels by day 12.
We engineered the nanoparticles to minimize off-target binding by anchoring T-cell-specific 
targeting ligands to their surfaces, and by shielding the nucleic acids they carry with a 
negatively charged polyglutamic acid coating. Nonetheless, a fraction of injected 
nanocarriers was cleared from the circulation by phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial 
system (for example, 16.2 ± 3.2% just by liver-resident phagocytes; Fig. 3c,d). To determine 
whether phagocytes that internalize DNA nanocarriers express the transgenes they take up, 
we quantified off-target CAR expression over time in the liver and the spleen. We found that 
one day after the last of the five nanoparticle doses (day 6), less than 1% of phagocytes in 
the liver and in the spleen expressed the nanoparticle-delivered genes (Supplementary Fig. 
6). Importantly, while the percentage of CAR-transfected cells among circulating T cells 
increased from 5.8% (±0.9%) to 19.7% (±4.1%) between day 6 and day 12 (Fig. 4a), the 
fraction of nanoparticle-transfected phagocytes in the liver and the spleen gradually 
decreased during the same time, indicating that CAR expression in these cell types does not 
trigger expansion or proliferative signals.
Nanoparticle-induced anti-tumour activities
To determine whether nanoparticle-redirected T cells are produced in quantities sufficient to 
reduce established cancers, we systemically injected luciferase-expressing Eμ-ALL01 
leukaemia cells (an immunocompetent mouse model of B-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia that recapitulates the disease at genetic, cellular and pathologic levels6) into 
albino C57BL/6 mice and used bioluminescent imaging to quantify differences in tumour 
progression between treatment groups. We found that injections of lymphocyte-targeted 
nanoparticles carrying P4-1BBz genes provided no improvements over controls, as mice 
comprising both groups had the same longevity (median survival: 13 versus 14 days, 
respectively; P = 0.51; Fig. 5a–c). By contrast, when we injected nanocarriers that

 programmed 194-1BBz (+iPB7 transposase), tumours were eradicated in seven out of ten 
mice, and the others showed substantial regression along with an average 58-day 
improvement in survival; Fig. 5a–c). As CD19 is expressed on B cells—both healthy and 
malignant alike—we found dramatically reduced B-cell numbers in the spleens of 
194-1BBz(+iPB7)-nanoparticle-treated animals (7.4 × 104 B cells/spleen ± 8.3 × 104 on day 
12; Fig. 5d), which is consistent with the reversible B-cell aplasia observed in patients 
following CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy10. In agreement with the inefficient programming of 
194-1BBz CAR T-cells using nanoparticles that carry 194-1BBz genes only (Fig. 4a–c), we 
saw only an average 5-day survival benefit in this treatment group compared with untreated 
control animals (Fig. 5c).
To compare the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle infusions with conventional adoptive T-
cell therapy, we treated an additional group of mice with a single dose of 5 million cells 
transduced ex vivo with lentiviral vectors encoding the 194-1BBz CAR. This quantity is 
equivalent to the higher doses of CAR T-cells used in current clinical studies, where patients 
have been treated with up to 1.2 × 107 CAR T-cells per kilogram of body weight11. To 
model clinical protocols of ongoing adoptive T-cell therapy trials, which usually require 
preconditioning chemotherapy of patients prior to CAR-transduced cell infusion12, CAR T-
cell-treated mice received 100 mg kg−1 cyclophosphamide intraperitoneally a day before T-
cell transfer to eliminate endogenous lymphocytes. We found that survival is greatly 
improved in mice treated with these transduced T cells, but not significantly better than 
those treated with synthetic nanoparticles programming the same receptors into circulating 
lymphocytes (Fig. 5a–c).
In summary, nanoparticles carrying genes of CD19-specific CARs can selectively and 
quickly edit T-cell specificity in vivo to bring about leukaemia regression in mice at 
efficacies comparable to conventional adoptive transfer of laboratory-manufactured CAR T-
cells.
Conclusions
The results described here establish for the first time that synthetic nanoparticles can be 
engineered to program antigen-recognizing capabilities into lymphocytes in vivo.
Our approach patently contrasts with those currently used to generate T cells with defined 
specificities against tumours, which require isolation of T cells from the patient’s blood and 
their genetic modification via complex laboratory procedures based on retroviral or lentiviral 
vectors1,13,14.
We performed our experiments using a syngeneic, immune-competent model of B-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia that not only measures direct anticancer activities of nanoparticle-
programmed CAR T-cells, but also recapitulates other interactions that may affect their 
eradication of tumours (for example, cell trafficking or immune suppressor cells)6. This 
model also enabled us to evaluate toxicities of nanoparticle treatments (Supplementary Fig. 
5). By contrast, preclinical adoptive T-cell therapy studies have mostly relied on xenogeneic

 models involving immunodeficient animals that do not accurately reflect tumour 
microenvironments and interactions between T cells and tissues15–17.
Our test system involved treating leukaemia using 194-1BBz CAR-encoding transgenes. We 
chose this receptor because it is currently by far the most investigated CAR (there are 36 
ongoing clinical trials internationally), and most lead-product candidates developed by 
cellular immunotherapy companies target CD19 (ref. 18). Certainly, treating solid tumours 
using this nanotechnology platform will be more challenging: unlike leukaemia cells, which 
universally express high levels of CD19 target antigen and are easily accessible by 
circulating T cells, solid cancers are heterogeneous and protected19. One approach we are 
developing to address these problems is to program T cells with multiple CARs recognizing 
several cancer antigens. Another is to perform genome editing to prevent the action of 
tumour-stimulated checkpoint inhibitors.
Clinical implementation of nanoparticle-mediated T-cell programming will heavily rely on 
the safety of the procedure. We chose poly(β-amino ester) polymer, which has a half-life 
between 1 and 7 h in aqueous conditions3, as the core material for T-cell-targeted 
nanocarriers, and shielded their positive charge to reduce off-target binding. PBAE-based 
nanoparticles have previously been described as safe and effective DNA delivery 
vectors3,20,21, albeit using local (and untargeted) rather than systemic application. The 
question of whether the potential benefits of in situ T-cell programming outweigh safety 
concerns regarding gene transfer into off-target cells must still be evaluated, either in a 
nonhuman primate model or directly in a phase-1 dose-escalation trial. In our project, we 
found that even though a fraction of T-cell-targeted DNA nanocarriers is taken up by 
phagocytes, the transgenes they carry are not (or are only inefficiently) expressed, and the 
cells do not remain stably transduced (Supplementary Fig. 6). It is well known that gene 
transfer into phagocytes is notoriously difficult, as they are bestowed with degradative 
enzymes that destroy nucleic acid integrity22. Furthermore, the limited proliferative nature 
of phagocytes does not favour nuclear entry and integration of the delivered transgenes. This 
sharply contrasts with lymphocytes, which undergo substantial clonal proliferation and 
differentiation into effector cells following antigen encounters. This, and the fact that the 
signalling domains of CARs are specifically designed to mimic T-cell-intrinsic stimulatory 
signals, leads us to conclude that toxicities arising from CAR expression in non-T cells 
would at most be minimal, and manageable in a clinical setting. To completely eliminate this 
risk, the nanoparticle-delivered CAR transgenes could be expressed under the control of a T-
cell-specific promoter23,24. Compared with the ubiquitous EF-1 alpha promoter we chose for 
our studies, cell-specific promoters have a weaker transcriptional activity—but thanks to the 
emergence of adoptive T-cell therapy, improved vector systems that enable tighter control of 
gene expression in T cells are in development25.
The clinical safety of this approach would further benefit from using a transposon/
transposase system that is already used in clinical trials to introduce CAR transgenes into 
patient T cells ex vivo. In particular, the Sleeping Beauty transposon has demonstrated 
efficient transposition and safety in several phase-1 clinical CAR T-cell trials26. Compared 
with conventional lentiviral vectors, which preferentially integrate into highly expressed 
cancer-related genes, this transposase mediates transgene integration into safe harbour loci

 that are not expected to cause mutagenesis27. To exclude the possibility of unintentionally 
integrating antibiotic resistance genes into the host genome, early clinical testing of 
nanoparticle-mediated CAR T-cell programming will also likely require that nanoparticle-
delivered genetic materials be in the form of minicircles28. Compared with the conventional 
plasmids we used in our current studies, minicircles are smaller, supercoiled DNA 
molecules; they also lack a bacterial origin of replication and an antibiotic resistance gene29.
In summary, our findings establish that circulating T cells can be modified to express 
leukaemia-specific CARs using genes carried by polymeric nanoparticles, thereby enabling 
them to mediate rejection of the disease. Nanoparticles are easy to manufacture and are 
stable, which simplifies long-term storage and reduces cost. Thus, implemented in the clinic 
as a new form of active immunotherapy, this technology could provide a practical, low-cost, 
broadly applicable way to treat cancer.

Plasmid construction
All of the plasmids used in this project were custom-cloned by vectorbuilder.com.
The following piggyBac transposon gene expression vectors were used:
1.
pPB-EF1alpha-murine194-1BBz-P2A-GFP-WPRE-BGH polyA
In this construct, a previously described all-murine CD19-specific CAR6 is 
expressed under the control of the EF1alpha promoter. The only difference 
between this and the original 1928z CAR (which is composed of a rat anti-mouse 
CD19 scFv fused to the mouse CD8 transmembrane region, mouse CD28 signal 
transduction domain, and mouse CD3 cytoplasmic domains), is the use of the 
mouse 4-1BB instead of the CD28 costimulatory domain. To assess gene-transfer 
efficiency and monitor in situ T-cell programming, we created a bicistronic 
genetic construct that co-expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) along with 
the m194-1BBz CAR by using a P2A peptide sequence. To increase gene 
expression, we placed a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory 
element (WPRE) between the stop codon and the bovine growth hormone (BGH) 
poly-A signal.

pPB-EF1alpha-murine194-1BBz-P2A-CBR-WPRE-BGH polyA
Instead of GFP, this version co-expresses the 194-1BBz CAR with click beetle

 These two control plasmids contain the same component as plasmids (1) and (2), 
respectively, but encode the tumour-irrelevant P4-1BBz CAR (ref. 9) instead of the 
leukaemia-specific 19-41BBz CAR. P4-1BBz retargets T lymphocytes to prostate-specific 
membrane antigen (PSMA), a protein expressed in prostate cancer cells and the 
neovasculature of various solid tumours in humans, but absent in mice.
The following regular plasmid gene expression vector was used:
pRP-EF1alpha-iPB7transposase-WPRE-SV40 polyA
This plasmid encodes the hyperactive iPB7 piggyBac transposase8 under the control of the 
EF1alpha promoter. A WPRE sequence was inserted between the stop codon and the SV40 
polyA.
The following lentivirus gene expression vector was used:
pLV-EF1alpha-murine194-1BBz-P2A-GFP-WPRE-BGH polyA
This construct’s gene expression cassette is identical to plasmid (1), only cloned into the 
vectorbuilder.com lentiviral backbone (third generation).
Cell lines
Both the Eμ-ALL01 cell line (a gift from M. Sadelain; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
Center, New York, New York)6 and the B16F10 melanoma cell line (American Type Culture 
Collection) were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal 
bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 gl−1 sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 gl−1 glucose, 10 
mM HEPES, 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The 
immunophenotype and geneexpression pattern have been characterized in ref. 6, and the 
results demonstrate that Ep-ALL01 cells have a progenitor B-cell phenotype (B220+ CD19+ 
CD43+ BP1+ HSA− IgM−). The HEK 293T lentiviral packaging cell line (Clontech) was 
cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamate, 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 
μg ml−1 streptomycin. For in vivo bioluminescent imaging, the Eμ-ALL01 cell line was 
retrovirally transduced with firefly luciferase (F-luc). All cell lines tested negative for 
mycoplasma using a DNA-based PCR test (DDC Medical).
MTAS-NLS peptide synthesis
The previously described MTAS-NLS peptide, encompassing a microtubule-associated 
sequence (MTAS) and a nuclear localization signalling (NLS) sequence4: 
GRYLTQETNKVETYKEQPLKTPGKKKKGKPGKRKEQEKKKRRTR was custom 
synthesized by AnaSpec Inc. A cysteine was added to the N-terminus of the peptide for 
linkage to the PBAE-447 polymer.
PBAE 447 synthesis
PBAE 447 was synthesized using a method similar to that in ref. 3. 1,4-butanediol diacrylate 
was combined with 4-amino-1-butanol in a 1.1:1 molar ratio of diacrylate monomer to 
amine monomer. These were heated to 90 °C with stirring for 24 h to produce acrylate-
terminated poly(4-amino-1-butanol-co-1,4-butanediol diacrylate). 2.3 g of this polymer was

 dissolved in 2 ml tetrahydrofuran (THF). To form the piperazine-capped 447 polymer, 786 
mg of 1-(3-aminopropyl)-4-methylpiperazine was dissolved in 13 ml THF then added to the 
polymer/THF solution. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature (RT) for 2 h. 
The capped polymer was precipitated with 5 volumes of diethyl ether. The ether was 
decanted, then the collected polymer was washed with 2 volumes of fresh ether. The 
polymer residue was dried under vacuum for 2 days. Neat polymer was dissolved in 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 100 mg ml−1 and stored at −20 °C.
PBAE 447–NLS-MTAS peptide conjugation
A solution of 12 mg 4-(maleinimido) phenyl isocyanate (PMPI) in DMSO (20 mg ml−1) was 
added to 86 mg 447 polymer in DMSO (100 mg ml−1). The solution was mixed at RT for 3 
h. The 447-maleimide derivative was added to a solution of 100 mg NLS-MTAS peptide in 
5.3 ml DMSO containing tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP•HCl; 3 mg 
ml−1). The solution was mixed at RT for 3 h then filtered through a 7k Zeba spin column 
equilibrated with DMSO. The DMSO was evaporated under vacuum overnight. The 447-
peptide conjugate was redissolved in DMSO to 100 mg ml−1 447 and stored at −20 °C.
Cy5-labelling of DNA
Plasmid DNA was labelled with Cy5 using the Mirus Label IT Nucleic Acid Labeling Kit 
with some modifications to the manufacturer’s protocol. The labelling reaction was 
incubated at 37 °C for 2 h using a 1:4 ratio of labelling reagent to DNA (v:w). The labelled 
DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation.
PGA–antibody conjugation
Polyglutamic acid (PGA) was dissolved in water to 20 mg ml−1 then sonicated for 10 min in 
a bath sonicator. An equal volume of ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide•HCl 
in water (4 mg ml−1, 16 equiv.) was added and the solution was mixed at RT for 5 min. The 
resulting activated PGA was added to a solution of antibody (In VivoMAb anti-mouse CD3ε 
F(ab′)2 fragments from Bioxcell.com; cat. no. BE0001-1FAB) in phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS) at a 4:1 molar ratio and mixed at RT for 6 h. Excess reagents were removed by 
dialysis (20,000 MWCO Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassette) against PBS for 24 h, followed by 
filtration through a 40k Zeba spin column. Antibody concentration was determined using a 
NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
Nanoparticle preparation
All components were diluted in sodium acetate buffer (25 mM, pH 5.2) to the following 
concentrations: DNA, 0.1 mg ml−1; PBAEs 447 and 447–NLS-MTAS, 3.14 mg ml−1; PGA-
antibody, 0.45 mg ml−1 Ab. To prepare the particles, 447–NLS-MTAS was added to DNA at 
a PBAE:DNA mass ratio of 15:1. The mixture was vortexed gently for 10 s then incubated at 
RT for 2 min. Unconjugated 447 was then added to the complex at a PBAE:DNA mass ratio 
of 15:1. The mixture was vortexed gently for 10 s then incubated at RT for 5 min. PGA-
antibody was then added at an Ab:DNA mass ratio of 2.5:1. The mixture was vortexed 
gently for 10 s then incubated at RT for 5 min. Sucrose was added as a cryoprotectant to a 
final concentration of 30 mg ml−1. The mixture was vortexed briefly, frozen in liquid N2,

 then lyophilized using a FreeZone 2.51 Freeze Dry System (Labconco). Lyophilized 
particles were resuspended in water at 1/3 of the pre-lyophilization volume.
Nanoparticle characterization
The number, average hydrodynamic radius and concentration of the nanoparticles were 
determined using a NanoSight NS300 instrument (Malvern Instruments). Lyophilized 
particles were resuspended in water at the same concentration used for transfection. After 
gentle vortexing, the particles were incubated on ice for 10 min to allow for complete 
hydration. The suspension was centrifuged for 3 min at 2,400g, then the supernatant was 
diluted 5-fold for Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. The zeta potential of the particles was 
determined using a ZetaPALS Zeta Potential Analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments 
Corporation). Freshly prepared nanoparticles were centrifuged for 1 min at 1,000g, then the 
supernatant was diluted 14× in PBS for these measurements.
Transmission electron microscopy
25 μl of freshly made nanoparticles was deposited on a glow discharge-treated 200 mesh 
carbon/Formvar-coated copper grid. After 30 s, the grid was touched sequentially to a drop 
of ½ Karnovsky’s fixative, a drop of 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, 8 drops of dH2O (distilled 
water), then a drop of 1% (w/v) filtered uranyl acetate. The grid was run over filter paper 
with a strip of dH2O, then dried overnight in a desiccator. Samples were imaged with a 
JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV (JEOL USA).
In vitro T-cell transfection using synthetic DNA nanocarriers
Spleens of C57BL/6J mice were macerated over a filter, and resuspended in ACK lysing 
buffer (Biosource). Effector CD8+ T cells were prepared by incubating splenocytes (3 × 106 
ml−1) in complete RPMI 1640 with 1 ng ml−1 interleukin-7 (PeproTech) and 2 μg ml−1 
Concavalin A (Calbiochem) at 37°C. Two days later, dead cells were removed by Ficoll 
gradient separation (GE Healthcare) and CD8+ cells were isolated using a mouse CD8 
Negative Isolation Kit (Stemcell Technologies). Cells were captured by passing them over a 
syringe filter with a 1-μm pore size. Subsequently, the filter was loaded (Fig. 2c) with the 
nanoparticle suspension, using the particle concentrations indicated in the figures, and 
allowed to empty by gravity flow. To release nanoparticle-transfected T cells, we reversed 
the filter and flushed it three times with complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 ng ml−1 
interleukin-2.
Functional in vitro T-cell assays
Cytotoxicity assay—We measured in vitro cytotoxic activity of T cells using standard 
flow cytometry-based assays as described elsewhere31. Briefly, Eμ-ALL01 leukaemia cells 
(or B16F10 melanoma tumour cells as controls) were labelled with the membrane dye 
PKH-26 (Sigma-Aldrich), washed with RPMI containing 10% foetal calf serum, and 
resuspended in the same medium at a concentration of 1 × 105 tumour cells per ml. T cells 
were added to the suspensions at varying effector-to-target cell ratios in 96-well plates (final 
volume, 200 μl) and incubated for 3h at 37 °C. Then, cells were transferred to V-bottom 96-

 well plates and stained with Annexin V-Brilliant Violet 421 (BioLegend). Following a wash 
in PBS, the cells were analysed by flow cytometry.
Cytokine secretion assay—T-cell cytokine release was measured with ELISA (R&D 
Systems) 24 h (IL-2) or 48 h (IFN-γ and TNF-α) after stimulation on irradiated Eμ-ALL01 
leukaemia cells or B16F10 melanoma controls.
Southern blot analysis
DNA of T cells (either nanoparticle-transfected and GFP-sorted, or untransfected) was 
digested with the restriction enzymes NotI and XmaI (New England Biolabs) that cleave 
within the transposon sequence to produce an internal 750-bp fragment. Following 
digestion, approximately 10 μg DNA was electrophoresed, transferred to a Hybond-N+ 
membrane (GE Healthcare), and hybridized using QuickHyb hybridization solution 
(Stratagene) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. For hybridization, a 500-bp 
probe specific for the 750-bp fragment was generated by PCR amplification from 10 pg 
transposon-containing plasmid DNA and labelled with a Rediprime II DNA Labeling 
System (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Mice and in vivo tumour models
Mice were housed in the animal facility at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and 
used in the context of a protocol approved by the Center’s Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee. We modelled haematological cancers by systemically injecting luciferase-
expressing Eμ-ALL01 leukaemia cells6 into 4–6-week-old female albino B6 (C57BL/6J-Tyr 
< c-2J>) mice (Jackson Laboratories) and allowing them to develop for 1 week. Following 
tail-vein injection of Eμ-ALL01 leukaemia cells, all animals were included in our studies 
and included in the analysis, and the mice were randomly assigned to experimental cohorts. 
They were then treated daily for 5 days with 3 × 1011 CD3-targeted nanoparticles carrying 
CAR-transgenes (or control particles) in a suspension that was administered slowly over 20 
min through a rodent tail-vein catheter using a programmable BS-300 infusion pump (both 
Braintree Scientific Inc.). To compare the therapeutic efficacy of nanoparticle infusions with 
conventional adoptive T-cell therapy, one group of mice was treated with a single dose of 5 
million T cells transduced ex vivo with a murine194-1BBz CAR-encoding lentiviral vector. 
Only these mice were preconditioned with 100 mg kg−1 cyclophosphamide intraperitoneally 
to eliminate endogenous lymphocytes a day before T-cell transfer.
Lentiviral production and ex vivo T-cell transduction
Lentiviral stocks were generated by transfection of 293T cells with the pLV-EF1alpha-
murine194-1BBz-P2A-GFP-WPRE-BGH polyA plasmid described above 
(pCMVdeltaR8.91) and pMD.G (both plasmids were purchased from Addgene) followed by 
concentration as previously reported32. For lentiviral gene transfer into murine T cells, 1 ml 
per well of lentivirus was preloaded on 6-well non-tissue-culture-treated dishes coated with 
RetroNectin (TakaraBio) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. An equal volume of Concavalin A/
IL-7 activated T lymphocytes (3 × 106 cells per ml−1 in RPMI medium supplemented with 
50 IU hIL-2 ml−1) was added and centrifuged at 2,000g for 30 min. Six hours after

 spinoculation, 1 ml of fresh, prewarmed RPMI containing 50 IU hIL-2 (Chiron) was added. 
T cells were used for adoptive transfer experiments 2 days after gene transfer.
In vivo bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging
We used D-luciferin (Xenogen) in PBS (15 mg ml−1) as a substrate for F-luc (used for 
imaging of Eμ-ALL01 leukaemia cells) and CBR-luc30 (used for T-cell imaging). 
Bioluminescence images were collected with a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum Imaging System 
(Xenogen). Living Image software version 4.3.1 (Xenogen) was used to acquire (and later 
quantitate) the data 10 min after intraperitoneal injection of D-luciferin into animals 
anesthetized with 150 mg kg−1 of 2% isoflurane (Forane, Baxter Healthcare). Acquisition 
times ranged from 10 s to 5 min. To correct for background bioluminescence, we subtracted 
signals acquired from tumour-free mice (injected with D-luciferin) from the measurement 
region of interest (ROI).
For in vivo fluorescence biodistribution studies (Fig. 4), we loaded CD3-targeted or non-
targeted polymer nanoparticles with Cy5-labelled plasmid DNA. To extract the signal 
emitted by the Cy5 fluorophore (excitation (ex): 647 nm, emission (em): 665 nm) from 
tissue autofluorescence, an image sequence (ex: 465 nm, em, 520 nm/ex: 535 nm, em: 600 
nm/ex: 570 nm, em: 620 nm/ex: 675 nm, em: 720 nm; f/stop 2, which is a measure of the 
lens aperture, 10 s) was collected with the imaging system, and spectrally unmixed using 
Living Image software. Before all bioimaging experiments, Nair depilatory cream (Church 
and Dwight) was applied to the C57Bl/6 mice and washed off to remove hair.
Nanoparticle biodistribution
C57Bl/6 mice were intravenously injected with 3×1011 Cy5-tagged nanoparticles that were 
either non-targeted, or targeted to the T-cell CD3 molecule. The nanoparticle suspension was 
administered through a tail vein as described above. After 6 h, tissues as indicated were 
removed, weighed and macerated as needed with scissors. We quantified specific Cy5 tissue 
fluorescence for each organ using the IVIS Spectrum imaging system, and calculated the 
percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID g−1) as the final readout.
Toxicity studies
To measure potential in vivo toxicities of repeatedly infusing lymphocyte-targeted DNA 
nanocariers, we injected mice intravenously with five sequential doses of 3 × 1011 CD3-
targeted nanoparticles carrying P4-1BBz CAR-encoding transgenes over the course of 5 
days. Control animals received no treatment. Each experimental group comprised 10 mice. 
Twenty-four hours after the final nanoparticle infusion, mice were anesthetized and blood 
was collected by retro-orbital bleed using heparinized microcapillary tubes into 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-containing microcontainers for determination of the 
complete blood count (CBC), which included a white blood cell count with differential, a 
red blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, and a platelet count. Blood was also 
collected into serum separator tubes for serum chemistry and cytokine profile analyses 
(performed by AniLytics Inc.). Animals were then euthanized with carbon dioxide to 
retrieve organs, which were washed with deionized water before fixation in 4% 
paraformaldehyde. The tissues were processed routinely, and sections were stained with

 hematoxylin and eosin. The specimens were interpreted by S. Pillai, a board-certified staff 
pathologist, in a blinded fashion.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
All flow cytometry antibodies were purchased from ebioscience. Cells were acquired on a 
FACSCanto Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). For experiments involving fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (Figs 2e–h and 3a), a FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences) was 
used.
Confocal microscopy
Cells were transferred onto fibronectin (Sigma Aldrich)-coated 10-mm teflon ring glass 
slides (Esco), fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent 
(Invitrogen) for 24 h, and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope.
Statistical methods
Pairwise differences in bioluminescent tumour and T-cell signals were analysed at selected 
time points using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and we characterized survival data using the 
Log-rank test. We treated 10 animals per group, which provided 80% power to detect an 
effect size of 1 standard deviation between groups, based on a t-test with a two-sided 
significance level of 0.05. With the exception of the toxicity studies, investigators 
conducting the experiments were not blinded. All statistical analyses were performed using 
GraphPad Prism software version 6.0.

 Figure 3. CD3-targeted nanoparticles bind to circulating T cells in mice
a, Flow cytometry demonstrating fluorescent nanoparticle binding to peripheral T cells 4 h 
after a 3 × 1011 dose was injected. The right panel is confocal microscopy of CD3-sorted T 
cells, establishing that, like in vitro, the particles are rapidly internalized from the surfaces of 
circulating cells. Shown below are the phenotypes of other circulating cell subtypes that 
non-specifically bound the injected nanoparticles, as measured by flow cytometry: 
neutrophils (Ly6G+, CD11b+, CD11c−), monocytes (Ly6C+, CD11b+, CD11c−), eosinophils 
(CD11b+, CD193+, F4/80+), natural killer (NK) cells (CD49b+, NKp46+), B cells (B220+). 
Data are representative of two independent experiments with two animals per treatment 
group. Scale bar, 3 μm. b, Phenotypes of circulating T cell subtypes internalizing injected 
nanoparticles, as measured by flow cytometry: naive T cells (CD62L+, CD44−), effector T

 memory (EM) T cells (CD62Llow, CD44+), and regulatory T (Treg) cells (CD4+, Foxp3+, 
CD25+). The CD4:CD8 ratio of nanoparticle-transfected T cells is shown as a pie chart in 
the centre; the bar graphs on the sides reflect percentages of each T-cell subtype. c, 
Biodistribution of fluorescent T-cell-targeted or non-targeted nanoparticles 4 h after tail-vein 
injection. Data are expressed as injected dose (ID) per gram of tissue. Bl, blood; Li, liver; 
Sp, spleen; Ln, lymph node; Bm, bone marrow; Lu, lung; Si, small intestine; Ki, kidney; 
Mu, muscle. Data are from ten mice per treatment condition pooled from two independent 
experiments. Each bar represents the mean percentage of ID per gram tissue ± s.e.m. d, 
Bioimaging of nanoparticle distributions. One representative mouse from each cohort (n = 
10) is shown. A bar graph on the right reflects percentages of splenocytes positive for 
fluorescent nanoparticles in animals treated with CD3-targeted nanoparticles, as measured 
by flow cytometry: T cells (CD3+), macrophages (F4/80+, CD11b+, CD11c−), monocytes 
(CD11b+, Gr1+, F4/80low), and B cells (B220+).

 Figure 4. Reprogramming host T cells with leukaemia-specific CAR genes
a, Top: flow cytometry of peripheral T cells following injection of nanoparticles delivering 
DNA that encodes 194-1BBz_2A_GFP or tumour-irrelevant P4-1BBz_2A_GFP genes. The 
profiles shown here are representative of two independent experiments consisting of five 
mice per group. Bottom: to determine whether persistent CAR expression in actively 
dividing T cells requires co-delivery of plasmid encoding the hyperactive transposase, we 
also compared 194-1BBz transgene-loaded nanocarriers containing or lacking iPBS7 
transgenes. b, Sequential bioimaging of nanoparticle-programmed CAR+ T cells. In this 
experiment, nanoparticles were loaded with plasmids that co-express the click beetle red 
luciferase (CBR-luc) reporter along with the CAR transgene. As in the previous experiments 
(panel a), 194-1BBz CAR-encoding nanoparticles were prepared with or without iPB7 
transgenes. Five representative mice from each cohort (n = 10) are shown. c, Plots of CBR-
luc signal intensities after nanoparticle injections. Each line represents one animal and each 
dot reflects its whole animal photon count. Pairwise differences in photon counts between 
treatment groups were analysed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Shown are data for ten 
mice per treatment condition pooled from three independent experiments.

 Figure 5. Nanoparticle-programmed CAR lymphocytes can cause tumour regression with 
efficacies similar to adoptive T-cell therapy
a, Sequential bioimaging of firefly luciferase-expressing Eμ-ALL01 leukaemia cells 
systemically injected into albino C57BL/6 mice. One week after this injection (Day 0), the 
animals were treated with five sequential injections (Day 0-Day 5) of 3 ×1011 lymphocyte-
targeting nanoparticles carrying 194-1BBz or P4-1BBz CAR-encoding transgenes. To test 
whether integration of nanoparticle-delivered CAR transgenes into the chromosomes of in 
situ reprogrammed T cells is a requirement to achieve anti-leukaemia effects, we injected 
194-1BBz transgene-loaded nanocarriers with or without iPBS7 transgenes into two 
different treatment groups. Controls were not treated. An additional group of mice was first 
given cyclophosphamide, then a day later treated with a single dose of 5 million CAR+ T 
cells that had been transduced ex vivo with 194-1BBz-encoding lentiviral vectors. Five

 representative mice from each cohort (n = 10) are shown. b, Quantification of the results 
shown in a. Every line represents one animal and each dot reflects the whole animal photon 
count. c, Survival of animals following therapy, depicted as Kaplan-Meier curves. Shown are 
ten mice per treatment group pooled from three independent experiments. ms, median 
survival. Statistical analysis between the treated experimental and the untreated control 
group was performed using the Log-rank test; P <0.05 was considered significant. d, Flow 
cytometry plots showing killing of malignant and normal B cells 12 days after treatment 
with 194-1BBz-encoding nanoparticles. The numbers labelling the peaks represent 
percentage of GFP-negative (left) and GFP-positive (right) cells. The leukemia cells were 
GFP-positive, whereas the endogenous B cells are GFP-negative. To distinguish leukaemia 
from healthy B lymphocytes, Eμ-ALL01 cells were genetically tagged with GFP. The 
respective subsets are illustrated in separate histogram plots that are gated on CD19+ cell 
populations. Data are representative of ten mice per treatment group pooled from three 
independent experiments.
