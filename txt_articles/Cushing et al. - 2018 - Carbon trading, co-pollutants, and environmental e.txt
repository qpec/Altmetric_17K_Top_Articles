Abstract
Background
Policies to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can yield
public health benefits by also reducing emissions of hazardous co-pollutants, such as air
toxics and particulate matter. Socioeconomically disadvantaged communities are typically
disproportionately exposed to air pollutants, and therefore climate policy could also poten-
tially reduce these environmental inequities. We sought to explore potential social disparities
in GHG and co-pollutant emissions under an existing carbon trading program—the domi-
nant approach to GHG regulation in the US and globally.
Methods and findings
We examined the relationship between multiple measures of neighborhood disadvantage
and the location of GHG and co-pollutant emissions from facilities regulated under Califor-
nia’s cap-and-trade program—the world’s fourth largest operational carbon trading program.
We examined temporal patterns in annual average emissions of GHGs, particulate matter
(PM2.5), nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds, and air toxics before
(January 1, 2011–December 31, 2012) and after (January 1, 2013–December 31, 2015) the
initiation of carbon trading. We found that facilities regulated under California’s cap-and-
trade program are disproportionately located in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods
with higher proportions of residents of color, and that the quantities of co-pollutant emissions
from these facilities were correlated with GHG emissions through time. Moreover, the
majority (52%) of regulated facilities reported higher annual average local (in-state) GHG

 emissions since the initiation of trading. Neighborhoods that experienced increases in
annual average GHG and co-pollutant emissions from regulated facilities nearby after trad-
ing began had higher proportions of people of color and poor, less educated, and linguisti-
cally isolated residents, compared to neighborhoods that experienced decreases in GHGs.
These study results reflect preliminary emissions and social equity patterns of the first 3
years of California’s cap-and-trade program for which data are available. Due to data limita-
tions, this analysis did not assess the emissions and equity implications of GHG reductions
from transportation-related emission sources. Future emission patterns may shift, due to
changes in industrial production decisions and policy initiatives that further incentivize local
GHG and co-pollutant reductions in disadvantaged communities.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine social disparities in GHG and co-pollut-
ant emissions under an existing carbon trading program. Our results indicate that, thus far,
California’s cap-and-trade program has not yielded improvements in environmental equity
with respect to health-damaging co-pollutant emissions. This could change, however, as the
cap on GHG emissions is gradually lowered in the future. The incorporation of additional pol-
icy and regulatory elements that incentivize more local emission reductions in disadvan-
taged communities could enhance the local air quality and environmental equity benefits of
California’s climate change mitigation efforts.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Climate change policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can also reduce
emissions of hazardous co-pollutants, such as air toxics and particulate matter.
• Decreases in GHG emissions are therefore also likely to provide health benefits by
improving local air quality to communities near regulated facilities.
• Globally, socioeconomically disadvantaged communities are often disproportionately
exposed to hazardous air pollutants due to emissions from facilities nearby.
• We examined temporal patterns in GHG and co-pollutant emissions with respect to
neighborhood demographics under California’s cap-and-trade program—the world’s
fourth largest carbon trading market.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We assessed GHG and co-pollutant (particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides,
volatile organic compounds, and air toxics) emission patterns and the social equity
implications of California’s cap-and-trade program before (2011–2012) and after
(2013–2015) the initiation of carbon trading.

 • Facilities regulated under California’s cap-and-trade program are disproportionately
located in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
• Statistical analysis found that co-pollutant emissions from regulated facilities were tem-
porally correlated with GHG emissions, and most regulated facilities (52%) reported
higher annual average local (in-state) GHG emissions after the initiation of trading,
even though total emissions remained well under the cap established by the program.
• Since California’s cap-and-trade program began, neighborhoods that experienced
increases in annual average GHG and co-pollutant emissions from regulated facilities
nearby had higher proportions of people of color and poor, less educated, and linguisti-
cally isolated residents, compared to neighborhoods that experienced decreases in
GHGs.
What do these findings mean?
• To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess social disparities in GHG and co-pol-
lutant emissions under an existing carbon trading program.
• Although GHG emission reductions could bring about significant air quality and health
benefits for California’s disadvantaged residents, thus far the state’s cap-and-trade pro-
gram has yet to yield such localized improvements in environmental equity.
• Policy and regulatory incentives to enhance local GHG emission reductions in disad-
vantaged communities could yield greater local air quality and environmental equity
benefits from California’s climate change mitigation strategies.
• Future regulatory efforts should systematically track trends in hazardous co-pollutant
emissions associated with GHG emissions from stationary and transportation-related
sources and assess how they impact socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.
Introduction
Health and environmental equity benefits of reducing greenhouse gases
(GHGs)
GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2), indirectly impact health by causing climate change
but are not directly harmful at the concentrations typically found in outdoor air. However,
GHG emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels are accompanied by other hazardous co-
pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), ozone-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) that cause respiratory and cardiovascular disease and increases in
mortality [1]. Decreases in GHG emissions from combustion are thus likely to provide short-
and long-term health benefits by improving local air quality [2]. Several studies estimate that
the economic cost savings of reduced air-pollution-related illness and death often outweigh
the costs of GHG mitigation [3–5].
Globally, socioeconomically disadvantaged communities are often disproportionately
exposed to hazardous air pollutants [6,7]. In the US, regulation under the Clean Air Act has

 led to significant improvements in ambient air quality even while the economy and population
have grown [8]. However, many air toxics remain unregulated, and some industrial facilities
are exempt from regulation due to their vintage, size, or location. Moreover, many US cities
are out of compliance with ambient air quality standards, and stark racial, ethnic, and class-
based inequalities in exposure to air pollutants remain [9]. For example, in the US, Asian
American, African American, and Hispanic individuals (herein referred to as “people of
color”) have higher estimated lifetime cancer risks from exposure to hazardous ambient air
pollutants compared to white individuals [10]. Similarly, based on location of residence, aver-
age outdoor nitrogen dioxide levels are 38% higher for people of color than for non-Hispanic
white individuals, and reducing ambient concentrations to the level experienced by white indi-
viduals would reduce ischemic heart disease mortality by an estimated 7,000 deaths per year
[11].
Strategies to reduce GHG emissions could be structured to also maximize the ancillary
health benefits of reducing these social inequalities in exposure to air pollutants that have per-
sisted despite decades of regulation. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that designing air
quality regulations to improve conditions for those who are most negatively impacted can also
efficiently improve overall outcomes at the population level. For example, Levy et al. examined
the equity and efficiency benefits of a suite of hypothetical rollouts of emission-control tech-
nology at US power plants, by simulating scenarios by which reductions of sulfur dioxide
(SO2), NOx, and fine PM (PM2.5) could be distributed to achieve national emission caps. The
authors applied a source–receptor matrix to determine pollutant concentration changes asso-
ciated with various control scenarios and mortality reductions, and estimated changes in the
spatial inequality of health risk, applying the Atkinson index for health risk inequality. Study
results found that reductions in spatial inequality in mortality associated with SO2 and PM2.5
emissions were correlated with higher total mortality reductions [12]. A later study looking at
controls on tail-pipe emissions on public buses in Boston, using a similar source–receptor
matrix method and inequality metric, found similar results [13].
Environmental equity concerns regarding cap-and-trade
Cap-and-trade has emerged as the dominant regulatory mechanism for pricing carbon and
reducing GHG emissions from large stationary sources around the world. Under a cap-and-
trade system, regulated companies must surrender tradable emission permits, or “allowances,”
equal to the amount of GHGs they emit (typically, 1 allowance equals 1,000 kg [1 metric ton
(t)] CO2 equivalent [CO2e]). The cap on emissions is set by the total allowances issued, which
is designed to decrease over time to secure aggregate gains. As the cap is lowered, regulated
companies can reduce their GHG emissions (e.g., through energy efficiency measures, new
technologies, or switching to less GHG-intensive fuels) or purchase excess allowances from
other regulated entities that are able to reduce their emissions more cheaply. Most cap-and-
trade programs also allow industries to purchase carbon offset credits generated from projects
in sectors outside of the cap and often outside of the legal jurisdiction of the program—such as
forestry or agriculture projects in other states or countries—that can be used in place of allow-
ances. The market-based approach of cap-and-trade ostensibly lowers emission reduction
costs and enhances industry support for climate change mitigation policies [14].
Some economists and environmental justice advocates argue that efficient climate regula-
tion requires deeper GHG reductions in locations where the health benefits of co-pollutant
reductions are likely to be greatest, and that this objective cannot be accomplished with the
geographically unrestricted trading characteristic of cap-and-trade in which all GHG reduc-
tions are treated equally regardless of where they occur [15]. Offsets may further undermine

 improvements to local air pollution by undercutting financial incentives for industries to
reduce emissions on site. Unless the location and co-pollutant intensity of GHG emissions are
incorporated into the design of a cap-and-trade system, carbon trading could also potentially
widen social inequities in exposure to localized hazardous co-pollutants because GHG-emit-
ting facilities, which are disproportionately located in disadvantaged communities, are able to
purchase allowances or offsets rather than reduce their emissions [15–17]. However, to our
knowledge, no studies have examined trends in co-pollutant emissions or social disparities in
emission reductions under an existing carbon trading program in order to inform climate pol-
icy design.
Methods
Using data from January 1, 2011–December 31, 2015, which includes the first 3 years of Cali-
fornia’s cap-and-trade program, we evaluated temporal and sector-specific trends in emissions
of GHGs and hazardous co-pollutants overall and with respect to multiple measures of neigh-
borhood demographics and disadvantage. Specifically, our analysis sought to examine the fol-
lowing questions: (1) What are the demographic characteristics of neighborhoods (census
block groups) surrounding facilities that are currently regulated under California’s cap-and-
trade program? (2) Since the program’s implementation, what patterns are evident in terms of
the relationship between local (in-state) GHG and co-pollutant emissions across and between
industry sectors? (3) What is the relationship between neighborhood demographics and tem-
poral patterns in local GHG and co-pollutant emissions? (4) What trends do we observe in
terms of companies that utilize offsets as part of their regulatory compliance obligations and
their local emissions of GHGs and co-pollutants?
California’s cap-and-trade program
California’s cap-and-trade program regulates carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and
fluorinated GHGs from power plants, refineries, industrial facilities, fuel suppliers, and other
entities that emit over 25,000 t CO2e of GHGs per year, with biogenic CO2 being exempt. The
program covers 3 types of GHG emissions: (1) direct emissions within the state (“local” emis-
sions); (2) indirect emissions from electricity imported from outside state boundaries; and (3)
starting in 2015, geographically distributed emissions from fuels such as gasoline and natural
gas. Beginning in 2013, industries were required to hold allowances equal to their GHG emis-
sions (1 allowance = 1 t CO2e). Over 90% of allowances were freely allocated during the first
compliance period of 2013–2014, with the balance auctioned or reserved for price contain-
ment. The total number of allowances in circulation, or “cap,” decreases by 3%–3.5% annually
between 2015 and 2020 in order to meet a cumulative GHG reduction target of 15% from 2015
to 2020. In addition, companies can meet 8% of their compliance obligation by purchasing
GHG emission reduction credits generated by offset projects located in the US (1 offset = 1 t
CO2e). Thus, by design, the 3%–3.5% annual reduction in GHG emissions set by the decreas-
ing cap can be achieved entirely via offset projects. Cutbacks in the use of more carbon inten-
sive energy sources imported from outside the state (such as electricity generated from coal-
fired rather than natural gas power plants) can also be used by regulated entities to meet emis-
sion reduction goals in lieu of in-state reductions.
Recognizing the social and environmental equity concerns related to cap-and-trade, Cali-
fornia passed legislation requiring that 25% of the revenue generated by the program be
invested in climate mitigation measures located in or benefitting disadvantaged communities
[18]. These communities are defined geographically based on CalEnviroScreen, a spatial map-
ping tool that combines 21 indicators of environmental quality and population vulnerability to

 identify communities most burdened by multiple sources of pollution and that may be espe-
cially vulnerable to their effects [19]. CalEnviroScreen incorporates measures of ambient pollu-
tion and proximity to pollution sources, most of which are not regulated under cap-and-trade;
these measures include hazardous waste sites, polluted water bodies, traffic density, pesticide
usage, drinking water quality, and ambient air quality measures for ozone and PM2.5. CalEn-
viroScreen also includes indicators of population vulnerability including low educational
attainment, poverty, linguistic isolation, and unemployment, and measures of health status,
because of the evidence that social stressors and underlying chronic health conditions may
exacerbate the adverse effects of pollution exposures [20]. A recent systematic review of rele-
vant human and animal studies using the Navigation Guide protocol [21] assessed the com-
bined impact and interaction of prenatal exposure to stressors and chemicals, including air
pollution, on developmental outcomes. For the most common outcome (fetal growth), the
authors evaluated risk of bias, calculated effect sizes for main effects of individual and com-
bined exposures, and found that, in human studies, effect estimates for pollutants were stron-
ger for groups exposed to higher levels of social stressors [22].
We utilize neighborhood demographic measures from the US Census and the CalEnviroSc-
reen designation of “disadvantaged communities”—which are the 25% of California census
tracts that score the worst on measures of environmental quality and population vulnerability—
to analyze the distribution of GHG and co-pollutant emissions from facilities regulated under
California’s cap-and-trade program.
Emissions data
GHG and co-pollutant emissions from facilities regulated under California’s cap-and-trade
program were downloaded from the Pollution Mapping Tool (formerly known as the Inte-
grated Emissions Visualization Tool) of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for the
calendar years 2011–2015 (https://www.arb.ca.gov/ei/tools/pollution_map/). The locations
(latitude and longitude) of facilities were obtained separately from CARB and were based on
geo-coding of facility-reported addresses. The locational information was manually cleaned
using satellite imagery from Google Earth to verify the location of GHG facilities. Facility-level
GHG emissions are self-reported to the State of California under the Regulation for the Man-
datory Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (mandatory reporting regulation [MRR]) pro-
gram [23] and include self-reported estimates of annual carbon dioxide (CO2), methane
(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated GHG emissions that have been verified by an
independent third party. Our analysis focused on “emitter covered” emissions (local emis-
sions), which correspond to localized, in-state emissions resulting from “the combustion of
fossil fuels, chemical and physical processes, vented emissions,” and “emissions from suppliers
of carbon dioxide” as well as emissions of GHGs other than CO2 from biogenic fuel combus-
tion. Emissions are given in units of CO2e based on the 100-year global warming potential fac-
tors given in Title 40, Part 98, of the Code of Federal Regulations, Subpart A, Table A-1, as
published in the Federal Register on October 30, 2009 (http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/reporting/
ghg-rep/regulation/subpart_a_rule_part98.pdf).
Facility-level emissions of PM, NOx, sulfur oxides (SOx), and VOCs are self-reported by
regulated facilities under the California Emission Inventory Development and Reporting Sys-
tem (CEIDARS) program. Reporting under CEIDARS is required every 4 years but may be
more frequent depending on the administrative air basin and facility. We made several adjust-
ments to harmonize the MRR and CEIDARS datasets. First, the GHG emissions for 3 hydro-
gen plants were allocated to nearby refineries because they primarily produce hydrogen for
those refineries and because the facilities appear to report jointly to CEIDARS. Second, we

 summed co-pollutant emissions from oil and gas facilities based on a cross-walk file provided
by CARB in order to harmonize the data with oil and gas GHG emissions that are reported on
a more aggregated basis to the MRR. Finally, 4 facilities merged into or were acquired by 2
other facilities during the study period. Emissions prior to the merger for these facilities were
combined for consistency in temporal reporting.
Data on the annual stack emissions of air toxics were downloaded from the US Environ-
mental Protection Agency’s Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) model using the
EasyRSEI application and matched to regulated California GHG facilities based on their name
and spatial proximity (https://www.epa.gov/rsei). In a few cases, if the facilities in the RSEI and
MRR databases were near each other but the names did not match, an internet search was
used to confirm that one company was a subsidiary of the other. RSEI emission estimates
come from data that are self-reported to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) as required by Sec-
tion 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act of 1986 [24]. Facili-
ties must report to the TRI if they are in a specific industry sector (such as mining, utilities,
manufacturing, and hazardous waste facilities), employ 10 or more full-time employees, and
manufacture, process, or handle a TRI-listed chemical in sufficient quantities (https://www.
epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/basics-tri-reporting). Only a fraction of facilities
regulated under California’s cap-and-trade program are required to report to TRI.
Facilities were initially categorized according to the first 2 digits of the North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes given in the MRR. In order to facilitate the anal-
ysis, we then grouped several categories together to achieve a greater number of facilities in
each category as follows: educational, healthcare and social assistance, professional, scientific,
technical, public administration, and other services were categorized as “public services”;
mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction were categorized as “oil and gas production/
supplier”; facilities in the “utilities” category with a NAICS description of “steam and air-con-
ditioning supply” were grouped as “co-generation”; support activities for transportation, agri-
culture, forestry, fishing and hunting, utilities, arts, entertainment, recreation, information,
wholesale trade, administrative and support, and waste management and remediation services,
and missing values were recoded as “other.” The category of paper, chemical, mineral, and
petroleum manufacturing was renamed “other manufacturing.” All other categories are as
coded by NAICS.
Finally, we conducted several additional data cleaning steps. We concluded from a visual
inspection of the 43 facilities that reported 0 emitter covered (i.e., local) GHG emissions dur-
ing 1 or more years that many of these 0 values were likely not true 0s, but artifacts of the
accounting rules that govern which emissions are covered under the program. Most facilities
reporting 0 emitter covered GHG emissions reported total GHG emissions during the same
year, and had reported emitter covered GHG emissions proportional to their total GHG emis-
sions in all other years. Therefore, we replaced 0 emitter covered GHG values with the value of
total GHGs reported by that facility during the same year, multiplied by the ratio of emitter
covered to total GHGs reported the prior year, or the subsequent year if the prior year was not
available. Finally, 5 GHG facilities reported 0 GHG emissions and then stopped reporting in
subsequent years. We assumed these facilities ceased operations during the study period and
assumed 0 GHG emissions for all years after reporting ceased.
Neighborhood demographics
We defined neighborhoods on the basis of 2010 vintage census block group boundaries pro-
vided by the US Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_blkgrp.
html). Block groups are generally contiguous geographic areas that contain between 600 and
Environmental equity and California’s cap-and-trade program

 3,000 people and can vary in size depending on population density. Geographic block group
centroids and the distance between block group centroids and GHG facility locations were cal-
culated using ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA). We considered 2 buffer distances when assigning
block groups to nearby GHG facilities based on their geographic centroid: 1 mile (1.6 km) and
2.5 miles (4.0 km).
Demographic information for each block group was obtained from the American Commu-
nity Survey 2011–2015 5-year estimates (https://www.census.gov/acs/www/). White individu-
als were defined as those who self-identified as white race but not Hispanic ethnicity. People of
color were defined as all other individuals, including those who identified as multiracial or of
Hispanic ethnicity. Poverty was defined as twice the federal poverty level to reflect increases in
the cost of living and California’s high cost of living relative to the rest of the country [25].
CalEnviroScreen 3.0 scores for all census tracts were obtained from the California Office of
Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/
calenviroscreen-30). Block groups are nested within census tracts, larger geographic units that
contain between 1,200 and 8,000 people. We assigned block groups the CalEnviroScreen score
of their census tract in order to compare CalEnviroScreen rankings near GHG facilities to
those of neighborhoods in the rest of the state.
Some oil and gas facilities report GHG emissions on an aggregate basis. In order to more
accurately characterize neighborhood demographics near the sites of the pollutant emissions,
we obtained information on the geographic location of drilling sites for 19 oil and gas facilities
from CARB. These drilling site locations were included when ascertaining whether a block
group was near a regulated facility. If a block group contained or was near several drilling sites
belonging to 1 facility, we considered it to be near 1 GHG facility rather than multiple.
Allowances and offsets
Information on the allocation of allowances was compiled from the California Code of Regula-
tions (17 CA ADC § 95841 and 17 CCR § 95870) and CARB publications on the public alloca-
tion of allowances and estimates of state-owned allowances [26–28]. We obtained the number
of allowances and offsets surrendered by each company at the completion of the first compli-
ance period from CARB’s 2013–2014 compliance report [29]. Information on individual offset
projects was compiled from CARB documents on offsets issued as of August 10, 2016 [30],
and individual project descriptions provided in the American Carbon Registry and Climate
Action Reserve carbon offset registries (http://americancarbonregistry.org; http://www.
climateactionreserve.org).
Analysis
The construction of the final dataset for analysis is shown in S1 Fig. All statistical analyses were
conducted in R (R Foundation; https://www.r-project.org). Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon tests
were used to test for differences in neighborhood demographics near facilities because demo-
graphic variables were not normally distributed. Emissions data were also highly skewed, so
we used log values in our analysis in order to reduce the non-normality of model residuals.
For the cross-sectional analysis, a series of simple linear regressions was used to examine the
correlation between GHG and co-pollutant emissions cross-sectionally for each industry cate-
gory, with log(t co-pollutant) as the outcome and log(t GHG) as the predictor variable using
the most recent year with both values available and greater than 0 for each facility.
For the longitudinal analysis, a series of mixed effects regression models was used to esti-
mate the correlation between GHG and co-pollutant emissions over time, with log(t co-pollut-
ant) as the outcome and log(t GHG) as the predictor variable. We included a random slope

 and a random intercept for facility. This approach allowed us to incorporate missing values
during years when facilities did not report; missing values were assumed to be missing at ran-
dom. In order to be able to incorporate 0 values, a small constant equivalent to the reporting
threshold divided by the square root of 2 was substituted for 0 values following convention for
left-censored, skewed environmental data. The reporting threshold was considered to be 0.05
in the original units of each data source (short tons for CEIDARs, metric tons for GHGs, and
pounds for air toxics) since the lowest reported values were 1, and we assumed values below
0.5 would have been rounded down to 0. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine the
effect of the imputed value for 0s on our results. Coefficients from the regression models can
be interpreted as estimates of the percent change in co-emissions associated with a 1% change
in emitter covered GHG emissions, either comparing across facilities in the case of the cross-
sectional analysis or over time in the case of the longitudinal analysis.
Finally, we also applied a multivariable logistic modeling strategy to assess the independent
effect of multiple block group demographic variables on the odds of an increase in annual
average GHGs and co-pollutant emissions from nearby facilities before (January 1, 2011–
December 31, 2012) versus after (January 1, 2013–December 31, 2015) implementation of the
cap-and-trade program.
Results
Facilities regulated under California’s cap-and-trade program are
disproportionately located in disadvantaged communities
GHG-emitting facilities regulated under California’s cap-and-trade program are dispropor-
tionately located in disadvantaged communities (Fig 1). The relative differences between
neighborhoods within 2.5 miles (4.0 km) (based on their geographic census block group cen-
troids) of a regulated facility as compared to neighborhoods located beyond 2.5 miles were, on
average, 59% higher in population density, 34% higher in the proportion of residents of color,

 23% higher in the proportion of poor residents, 64% higher in the proportion of residents with
low educational attainment, and 80% higher in the proportion of linguistically isolated house-
holds in which no one age 14 years or older speaks English very well (Table 1). A higher pro-
portion of neighborhoods near facilities were designated by CalEnviroScreen as disadvantaged
(38% versus 19% of neighborhoods not near facilities) (Table 1). Similar but generally smaller
relative differences also existed at the smaller, 1-mile (1.6 km), buffer distance; one exception
was a larger relative difference in the proportion of poor residents within 1 mile (54%) (see
S1 Table).
Most regulated facilities increased their local GHG emissions
The majority of facilities (52%) had higher annual average local GHG emissions (a change in
mean aggregate emissions of 6,773,670 t) after implementation (2013–2015) of the cap-and-
trade program as compared to the 2 years prior to implementation (2011–2012) (S4 Table). A
majority of facilities also increased their annual average PM2.5, VOC, and air toxics emissions
during this time period (51%, 57%, and 52%, respectively), while a minority increased their
annual average NOx and SOx emissions (46% and 44%, respectively). While the program has
claimed an overall reduction in total annual average GHG emissions during this period, this
decrease was primarily achieved through indirect reductions associated with cutbacks in pur-
chases of more carbon intensive electricity (such as electricity generated from coal-fired rather
than natural gas power plants) imported from outside the state, rather than reductions in local
emissions within California (see S2 Fig). Changes in GHG emissions within California during
this period varied by industry sector. For example, while 70% of co-generation facilities
decreased annual average emissions in 2013–2015 relative to 2011–2012, 75% of cement plants
increased emissions. Cement plants had the highest median increase in local GHG emissions,
followed by electricity generators, oil and gas producers, food and beverage manufacturing,
and refineries (Fig 2).

 GHG and co-pollutant emissions are correlated
GHGs and hazardous co-pollutants emitted by facilities regulated under California’s cap-and-
trade program were positively correlated when comparing across facilities. The strength of the
correlation between GHG and co-pollutant emissions across facilities varied by co-pollutant
and industry sector. Co-pollutant emissions tended to rise most steeply with GHG emissions
among public service facilities (for PM2.5), metal and machinery manufacturing facilities (for
NOx), refineries (for SOx), co-generation facilities (for VOCs), and other manufacturing facili-
ties (for air toxics), while co-pollutant emissions overall tended to be the most tightly corre-
lated with GHG emissions (based on the model R2) among cement plants and refineries
(Table 2).
GHG and co-pollutant emissions were also correlated within facilities over time. On aver-
age, a 1% change in annual GHG emissions at the facility level was accompanied by a 0.91%,
0.66%, 0.66%, 0.63%, and 0.48% change in air toxics, NOx, PM2.5, SOx, and VOCs, respectively
(all p < 0.001) (see Fig 3). This association indicates that reductions in GHG emissions can be
expected to result in reductions in co-pollutant emissions (and vice versa). Imputing slightly

We show log-linear regression coefficients (β), 95% confidence intervals, and model fit (R2). For facilities that were missing data for 2015, we used data from the most
recent year with non-0 emission values for both sets of pollutants. Eight facilities categorized as hydrogen plants or other are not shown because there were fewer than 5
facilities with data in either industry category.
an refers to the highest total number of facilities in that category. For some pollutants, the n may be smaller due to missing data. Air toxics are only reported by a small
proportion of facilities, and the n’s were as follows: cement plants (8), co-generation (6), electricity generation (4), food and beverage manufacturing (12), metal and
machinery manufacturing (10), oil and gas production/suppliers (2), other manufacturing (22), public services (0), and refineries (16).
bIn all, 595 individual chemicals and 32 chemical categories known to cause cancer, other acute or chronic human health effects, and/or significant adverse
environmental effects are included as air toxics and reported under the federal Toxics Release Inventory by a subset of facilities [32]. Some air toxics are also VOCs,
which are defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency as “any compound of carbon, excluding carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, metallic
carbides or carbonates, and ammonium carbonate, which participates in atmospheric photochemical reactions” [33].

 higher values for reported emissions of 0 in the analysis did not affect these effect estimates by
more than 3%. We did not observe a one-to-one relationship between changes in GHG and
co-pollutant emissions, which may be a result of the fact that emission reductions can be
achieved using diverse strategies. For example, a facility may use scrubbers to reduce PM emis-
sions, but potentially increase GHG emissions in the process because this pollution reduction
strategy is more energy intensive. Alternatively, a facility could undertake energy conservation
efforts that reduce energy use and thereby GHG emissions, but have little impact on air toxics
or other co-pollutant emissions that result from processes unrelated to energy production.
Emission patterns differ by neighborhood demographics
Given the spatially clustered nature of facilities regulated under California’s cap-and-trade pro-
gram, we examined the relationship between neighborhood demographics and changes in
emissions from all facilities located nearby (�2.5 miles from the geographic block group cen-
troid). We found that compared to neighborhoods that experienced decreases in aggregate
annual average GHG emissions after versus before implementation of carbon trading, neigh-
borhoods that experienced increases of both annual average GHGs and annual average co-pol-
lutants were more likely to be designated by CalEnviroScreen as disadvantaged and had higher
proportions of residents of color, higher rates of poverty, higher rates of low educational attain-
ment, and higher proportions of linguistically isolated households (Table 3). Population density
was generally lower in the neighborhoods that experienced emission increases, except for those
where both GHGs and air toxics from nearby facilities increased. Similar differences were also
noted using a 1-mile buffer distance (see S2 Table). Logistic modeling results assessing the odds

 of block groups experiencing increases of GHGs and each co-pollutant compared to block
groups that experienced decreases in either indicate that less densely populated block groups
and those with higher proportions of residents of color and residents with low levels of educa-
tional attainment had an increased odds of experiencing an increase in GHGs and co-pollut-
ants independent of the proportion of poor or linguistically isolated residents (Table 4). Results
for other demographic variables such as the proportion of residents living in poverty and the
proportion of linguistically isolated households were less consistent across models for each of
the co-pollutants. Overall, among those block groups that experienced increases in GHG and
co-pollutant emissions, the median and range of emission changes in metric tons was as fol-
lows: GHGs, 14,320 (1.7–1,137,000); PM2.5, 2.78 (0.03–113.6); NOx, 5.35 (0.03–223.2); SOx,
0.51 (<0.001–132.7); VOCs, 2.96 (0.015–296); and air toxics, 0.37 (0.001–95.6).
Offsets can undercut emission reduction efforts and environmental equity
goals
During the first compliance period (2013–2014), offset credits represented more than 4.4% of
the total compliance obligation (credits and offsets surrendered for each metric ton of GHGs
emitted), or over 4 times the targeted reduction as established by the cap in GHG emissions
from 2013 to 2014. The majority of the offset credits (75.6%) were generated by out-of-state
projects. Overall, most offset projects were in forestry (46.3%) and destruction of ozone-
depleting substances (45.6%). Facilities owned by companies that used offsets emitted

 significantly higher levels of GHGs than those owned by companies that did not use offsets
(see S3 Table). For example, the 10 companies using the most offset credits during the first
compliance period were responsible for 82% of offsets surrendered and 43% of total covered
GHG emissions. Facilities owned by companies that used offset credits also emitted more
PM2.5, NOx, SOx, and air toxics over the same time period, although these differences were not
statistically significant. Conversely, average VOC emissions were lower among companies that
used offsets (p = 0.001). While companies using offsets tended to be larger emitters overall,
their annual average changes in GHGs and co-pollutant emissions after (2013–2015) versus
before (2011–2012) the implementation of carbon trading were statistically indistinguishable
from those of companies not using offsets (data not shown).
Discussion
California’s efforts to slow climate change by reducing GHG emissions have the potential to
bring about significant air quality and health benefits to the state’s less advantaged residents.
GHG-emitting facilities tend to be located in neighborhoods with higher proportions of resi-
dents living in poverty and people of color, and the temporal correlation between GHG and
co-pollutant emissions indicates that incentivizing deeper reductions in local GHG emissions
could bolster the environmental equity goals articulated in California’s climate change laws.
Our results, however, indicate that, thus far, the cap-and-trade program has not yielded this
set of localized improvements in environmental equity.
Prior analyses of emission trading programs found little evidence that they produced
socially inequitable outcomes. For example, studies of the US Acid Rain Program to reduce
sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants and of Southern California’s Regional
Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) program to reduce NOx and SOx emissions from
large facilities such as power plants, refineries, and manufacturing facilities found no evidence
that the locations of emissions or purchases of allowances were disparate with respect to the
racial/ethnic makeup or income of surrounding neighborhoods [34–36]. One exception is an
analysis that incorporated dispersion modelling of emissions and found that high-income
neighborhoods benefitted more from RECLAIM than did low-income neighborhoods and
that, conditional on income, African American individuals benefitted more, and Hispanic

in each predictor. The reference group for each model is block groups that experienced decreases in either GHGs or the co-pollutant. n = 303 facilities for all models
except air toxics, which includes 82 facilities that are required to report emissions to the Toxics Release Inventory. We exclude 19 oil and gas facilities with multiple sub-
facility locations because they report their GHG emissions on an aggregated basis such that emission changes cannot be determined in the neighborhoods near the sub-
facility locations where they occur.

 individuals benefitted less, than white individuals [37]. Our analytical approach differs from
that taken in most prior studies because we use a neighborhood—rather than facility-level—
perspective to evaluate changes in aggregate emissions. Such an approach is warranted in our
context because polluting facilities are clustered in space and many Californians live in close
proximity to multiple facilities, as shown in Fig 1.
Our results also suggest that although California’s total GHG emissions are below the cap
set by the cap-and-trade program, results have been underwhelming with respect to local (in-
state) GHG emissions, which increased on average for regulated facilities in several industry
sectors (with a net increase of mean local GHG emissions of 6.7 million t CO2e from 2011–
2012 to 2013–2015, and a median facility-level increase of 600 t across all facilities that we ana-
lyzed). The lack of deeper reductions in local emissions may be due to an initial overallocation
of allowances that resulted in an oversupply of cheap allowances on the market. Emissions at
the initiation of the carbon trading program were lower than expected due to the economic
downturn related to the Great Recession of 2008, and the initial allocation of allowances was
thus far greater than the metric tons of regulated emissions. There was a larger aggregate
decrease in local GHG emissions in 2015 compared to prior years (see S2 Fig), suggesting that
greater reductions may be achieved going forward as the cap is lowered further. However,
banking of excess allowances from early years of the program [38] and the substantial use of
offset credits suggest that there may continue to be little reduction in in-state emissions. The
quantity of offsets allowed thus far under the program is worrisome because the validity of
GHG emission reductions claimed under offset projects is controversial given the challenge of
verifying if they are truly additional and would not have occurred in the absence of the cap-
and-trade program [39–42]. Offset credits included in our analysis were primarily generated
from forestry projects outside the state that do not offer the same benefits as localized co-pol-
lutant emission reductions. Recent California legislation (AB 398) seeks to address this issue
by reducing the use of offset credits generally, while also increasing the proportion of allowable
offsets that are generated from in-state projects [43]. Under the current cap-and-trade pro-
gram, offset credits can make up as much as 8% of the total amount of allowances used for
compliance by a regulated company. However, AB 398 will reduce this amount. From 2021 to
2025, up to 4% of a covered company’s compliance obligation can be met by offsets, and half
of these must be in state or “provide direct environmental benefits” to California. From 2026
to 2030, up to 6% of a covered company’s compliance obligations can be met by offsets, with at
least half generated from in-state projects.
In summary, our study results reflect preliminary local GHG and co-pollutant emissions
and social equity patterns of the first 3 years of California’s cap-and-trade program for
which data are currently available. One limitation of our analysis is that it was restricted to reg-
ulated industries and was not able to include an assessment of the emission patterns and equity
implications of GHG reductions from transportation-related sources. In addition, ongoing
investments of a significant portion of California’s cap-and-trade revenue in disadvantaged
communities as mandated by law [18] to mitigate climate change could also potentially incen-
tivize deeper local GHG and co-pollutant reductions in the future. As data to examine these
issues become available, future research can more holistically assess the extent to which GHG
and co-pollutant emission patterns from both industrial and transportation sources may be
shifting due to changes in industrial production decisions, cap-and-trade revenue investments,
and policy initiatives that encourage deeper in-state emission reductions, particularly in disad-
vantaged communities.
Some analysts have cautioned against integrating air quality into climate policy, and
argue that co-pollutants are best regulated under existing laws such as the US Clean Air Act
[44]. However, others note that the most cost-effective climate regulation would achieve

 GHG reductions in locations where the health benefits are greatest [15]. Our analysis sug-
gests that California’s climate policy could better harmonize efforts to reduce GHGs with
improvements to local air quality, and that market-based strategies in general could provide
greater overall benefits by incentivizing localized GHG reductions in disadvantaged and
highly polluted neighborhoods. For example, other emission trading programs have
restricted trading and raised the price of allowances within high-pollution areas in order to
promote deeper reductions in disproportionately impacted neighborhoods [45]. In addition,
regulated firms could be required or incentivized to purchase offsets that are linked to local
projects that reduce GHG emissions and also improve air quality in the regions where their
facilities are located; such local offset projects could include electrification of railyards
and ports, cleaning up truck fleets, or financing retrofits to reduce GHGs and co-pollutant
emissions from other local emission sources. Such local offset projects could enhance gov-
ernment oversight and promote community partnerships in project monitoring and emis-
sion verification.
The administrative costs of such an integrated strategy are likely to be modest, particularly
since a small number of industry sectors and facilities present the greatest opportunities to
achieve air quality co-benefits [15]. It would require more systematic temporal and spatial
tracking of the air quality and environmental equity impacts of cap-and-trade through annual
and verifiable GHG and co-pollutant emission reporting by each regulated facility, combined
with facility- and company-specific allowance allocations and trading information, including
the use of offsets. These data are beginning to be made publicly available, which will enable
more effective and timely regulatory oversight of emission temporal patterns and future
research on the health and environmental equity impacts of cap-and-trade. Ultimately, apply-
ing regulatory and analytical tools that address the contributions of GHG emission sources to
local cumulative air pollution burdens could support better integration of the sustainability
and environmental equity goals of California’s climate laws and inform carbon pricing efforts
elsewhere.
