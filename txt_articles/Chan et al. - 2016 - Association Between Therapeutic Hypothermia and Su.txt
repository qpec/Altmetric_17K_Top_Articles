IMPORTANCE Therapeutic hypothermia is used for patients following both out-of-hospital
and in-hospital cardiac arrest. However, randomized trials on its efficacy for the in-hospital
setting do not exist, and comparative effectiveness data are limited.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between therapeutic hypothermia and survival after
in-hospital cardiac arrest.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS In this cohort study, within the national Get With the
Guidelines–Resuscitation registry, 26 183 patients successfully resuscitated from an
in-hospital cardiac arrest between March 1, 2002, and December 31, 2014, and either
treated or not treated with hypothermia at 355 US hospitals were identified. Follow-up
ended February 4, 2015.
EXPOSURE Induction of therapeutic hypothermia.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge.
The secondary outcome was favorable neurological survival, defined as a Cerebral
Performance Category score of 1 or 2 (ie, without severe neurological disability). Comparisons
were performed using a matched propensity score analysis and examined for all cardiac
arrests and separately for nonshockable (asystole and pulseless electrical activity) and
shockable (ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia) cardiac arrests.
RESULTS Overall, 1568 of 26 183 patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (6.0%) were treated
with therapeutic hypothermia; 1524 of these patients (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [16.2] years;
58.5% male) were matched by propensity score to 3714 non–hypothermia-treated patients
(mean [SD] age, 62.2 [17.5] years; 57.1% male). After adjustment, therapeutic hypothermia
was associated with lower in-hospital survival (27.4% vs 29.2%; relative risk [RR], 0.88 [95%
CI, 0.80 to 0.97]; risk difference, −3.6% [95% CI, −6.3% to −0.9%]; P = .01), and this
association was similar (interaction P = .74) for nonshockable cardiac arrest rhythms (22.2%
vs 24.5%; RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.99]; risk difference, −3.2% [95% CI, −6.2% to −0.3%])
and shockable cardiac arrest rhythms (41.3% vs 44.1%; RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.05]; risk
difference, −4.6% [95% CI, −10.9% to 1.7%]). Therapeutic hypothermia was also associated
with lower rates of favorable neurological survival for the overall cohort (hypothermia-
treated group, 17.0% [246 of 1443 patients]; non–hypothermia-treated group, 20.5% [725 of
3529 patients]; RR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69 to 0.90]; risk difference, −4.4% [95% CI, −6.8% to
−2.0%]; P < .001) and for both rhythm types (interaction P = .88).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, use of
therapeutic hypothermia compared with usual care was associated with a lower likelihood of
survival to hospital discharge and a lower likelihood of favorable neurological survival. These
observational findings warrant a randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy of therapeutic
hypothermia for in-hospital cardiac arrest.

T
herapeutic hypothermia, or targeted temperature
management, is recommended for comatose patients
following both out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac
arrest.1 Nevertheless, therapeutic hypothermia has only been
shown to improve overall survival and rates of favorable neu-
rological survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac ar-
rest due to ventricular fibrillation.2,3 Whether this treatment
improves survival for patients with in-hospital cardiac
arrest—in which response times, comorbidity burden, and car-
diac arrest etiology differ markedly from the out-of-hospital
setting—is unknown.
To our knowledge, there have been no randomized trials
conducted in the in-hospital setting. Two small observa-
tional studies (comprising a total of 231 treated patients) have
not shown a survival benefit,4,5 and a third included only 42
treated patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest.6 In addition,
more than 80% of in-hospital cardiac arrests have initial
rhythms of asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA), car-
diac arrest rhythms for which the evidence base for therapeu-
tichypothermiaisunclear,evenfortheout-of-hospitalsetting.7
As in-hospital cardiac arrest affects approximately 200 000
individuals annually in the United States,8 there is a need to
understand whether therapeutic hypothermia is associated
with improved survival for these patients.
To address this gap in knowledge, this study was
designed to evaluate the association of hypothermia treat-
ment with survival to hospital discharge and with favorable
neurological survival at hospital discharge among patients
with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Data were leveraged from the
Get With the Guidelines (GWTG)–Resuscitation registry. In
addition, by linking this registry with Medicare files, the
association between hypothermia treatment and 1-year
survival was evaluated.
Methods
The institutional review board of Saint Luke’
s Mid America
Heart Institute approved this study and waived the require-
ment for informed consent because data were deidentified.
Data Sources
The GWTG-Resuscitation registry is a large, prospective, na-
tional, quality improvement registry of in-hospital cardiac ar-
rest sponsored by the American Heart Association. Its design
has been previously described.9 In brief, trained hospital per-
sonnel attempt to identify all patients without do-not-
resuscitate orders with a cardiac arrest (defined as absence of
a palpable central pulse, apnea, and unresponsiveness) who
undergo cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Cases are identified
by hospital research staff through multiple methods, includ-
ing centralized collection of cardiac arrest flow sheets, re-
views of hospital paging system logs, and routine checks of
code carts and pharmacy tracer drug records.9 Standardized
Utstein-style definitions are used for all patient variables and
outcomes to facilitate uniform reporting across hospitals.10,11
Data accuracy in GWTG-Resuscitation is supported by certifi-
cation of research staff, use of case-study methods for newly
enrolled hospitals to enhance operational definition compli-
ance prior to data acceptance, use of standardized software
with data checks for completeness and accuracy, and a peri-
odic reabstraction process, which has been demonstrated to
have a mean error rate of 2.4%.9
For patients aged 65 years and older, GWTG-Resuscita-
tion data have been previously linked with Medicare inpa-
tient files.12,13 For each linked patient, Medicare denominator
andinpatientfileswereobtained.Forthisstudy,asneweryears
of Medicare files were available, the deterministic linkage
was repeated for Medicare data through 2012. This linkage was
successful in 66.5% of Medicare-eligible patients in GWTG-
Resuscitation, similar to the prior rate of 68.6%.13
Study Population
The study included patients aged 18 years and older enrolled
in GWTG-Resuscitation between March 1, 2002 (after publi-
cation of hypothermia trials for out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest2,3),andDecember31,2014.Asthisstudyevaluatedthera-
peutic hypothermia, only patients with return of spontane-
ous circulation after an index in-hospital cardiac arrest were
included. For those aged 65 years and older, patients who were
not linked to Medicare inpatient files (no unique match or
enrolled after 2012) were excluded to enable examination of
postdischarge survival. To ascertain that hypothermia was
availableateachhospital,patientsfromhospitalswithnocases
of therapeutic hypothermia were excluded. Moreover, only
cases occurring after the first documented use of therapeutic
hypothermiaforin-hospitalcardiacarrestateachhospitalwere
included. As therapeutic hypothermia is considered in coma-
tosepatients,thecohortwasrestrictedtopatientsonmechani-
cal ventilation at the time of cardiac arrest (as documented by
GWTG-Resuscitation) or after cardiac arrest (as documented
by a Medicare International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification procedure code for mechani-
cal ventilation [96.7X] among those aged ≥65 years). Patients
with missing information on survival to discharge and comor-
biditiesformodeladjustmentwereexcluded.Furthermore,pa-
tients with an initial out-of-hospital cardiac arrest followed by
an in-hospital cardiac arrest were excluded.
Key Points
Question Is therapeutic hypothermia associated with better
survival outcomes for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest?
Findings In this cohort study using a US national registry, survival
outcomes were compared for 26 183 patients who were treated
vs not treated with therapeutic hypothermia after surviving an
in-hospital cardiac arrest. Compared with untreated patients,
those treated with therapeutic hypothermia had significantly
lower rates of in-hospital survival (29.2% vs 27.4%, respectively),
as well as lower rates of survival to discharge with favorable
neurological status.
Meaning Therapeutic hypothermia was not associated with
improved survival or better neurological outcomes and was
potentially harmful. Current use of therapeutic hypothermia for
in-hospital cardiac arrest may warrant reconsideration.

Independent Variable and Study Outcomes
The independent exposure variable was active induction of
therapeutic hypothermia, as documented within GWTG-
Resuscitation. The primary outcome was in-hospital survival
(ie, to hospital discharge). The secondary outcome was favor-
able neurological survival, defined as survival to hospital dis-
charge with a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2 (ie,
without severe neurological disability).14 Additionally, among
patients aged 65 years and older, cumulative survival (ie, area
under the survival curve) over the first year and 1-year sur-
vival were examined using Medicare denominator files. The
last follow-up date was February 4, 2015, for survival to dis-
charge and favorable neurological survival and December 31,
2012, for 1-year outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline differences between patients treated and not treated
with therapeutic hypothermia were evaluated using χ2 tests
for categorical variables and t tests for continuous variables.
To evaluate the association between therapeutic hypo-
thermia treatment and survival outcomes, propensity score
analyses were conducted. A multivariable logistic regression
model was constructed to estimate a patient’
s likelihood of
being treated with therapeutic hypothermia after in-hospital
cardiac arrest. This model included the hospital site and the
following variables from GWTG-Resuscitation: age, sex, self-
identified race by patients or families (which is known to affect
survival15 and was categorized as white, black, and other),
initial cardiac arrest rhythm (asystole, PEA, ventricular fibril-
lation, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia), location of car-
diac arrest, comorbid conditions (prior heart failure or myo-
cardial infarction, index admission heart failure or myocardial
infarction, diabetes mellitus, baseline depression in central
nervous system function, acute stroke, pneumonia, and meta-
static or hematologic malignant neoplasm), medical condi-
tions present within 24 hours of cardiac arrest (renal insuffi-
ciency, hepatic insufficiency, respiratory insufficiency,
hypotension, septicemia, and metabolic or electrolyte abnor-
mality), and interventions in place at the time of cardiac
arrest (continuous intravenous vasopressor, implantable car-
dioverter-defibrillator, and hemodialysis). The model also ad-
justedfordurationofacutecardiopulmonaryresuscitation,the
time of day (work hours [7:00 AM to 10:59 PM] vs after hours
[11:00 PM to 6:59 AM]), and day of the week (weekday vs week-
end) of the cardiac arrest.16
After deriving a propensity score for each patient, variable
optimalmatchingforeachhypothermia-treatedpatientwasper-
formed, with up to 4 controls without replacement for each
treated patient, using an algorithm match with a caliper width
no greater than 0.2 times the standard deviation of the logit of
the propensity score.17 Besides matching by propensity score,
hypothermia-treated and non–hypothermia-treated patients
were additionally matched on 3 other criteria: cardiac arrest
within365daysofthehypothermia-treatedpatient’
scardiacar-
rest, initial cardiac arrest rhythm, and duration of acute cardio-
pulmonary resuscitation (in 5-minute categories [eg, 6-10 min-
utes, 11-15 minutes, 16-20 minutes]). Matched patients were
compared to assess balance in covariates (ie, standardized dif-
ferencesforeachcovariatewere<10%).18 Afterconfirmingthis,
the associations between therapeutic hypothermia and sur-
vival to discharge and favorable neurological survival were as-
sessed by constructing binomial models using a log link strati-
fied by matched sets to estimate relative risks (RRs) as well as
an identity link to estimate risk differences.19
Interaction analyses were conducted between therapeu-
tic hypothermia and cardiac arrest rhythm to assess whether
the association between therapeutic hypothermia and sur-
vival outcomes differed for patients with shockable (ventricu-
lar fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia) and non-
shockable(asystoleandPEA)cardiacarrestrhythms.For1-year
survival, a separate propensity score model was derived for pa-
tients aged 65 years and older. Cumulative survival over the
first year was compared between the propensity score–
matched patients. In addition, a binomial model using a log
link stratified by matched sets assessed overall rates of 1-year
survival.
Although use of a propensity score balances measured
covariates between treatment groups, indication bias due to
unmeasured confounding may exist. To address this, a sensi-
tivity analysis was conducted whereby all patients who died
within the first 24 hours were excluded. If there was indica-
tion bias against therapeutic hypothermia treatment
(whereby sicker patients were more likely to receive thera-
peutic hypothermia), this analysis, from 24 hours onward,
would result in a stronger survival benefit for therapeutic
hypothermia treatment, as a greater proportion of patients
treated with hypothermia would have died during the first 24
hours. This sensitivity analysis was conducted after deriving
new propensity scores for this cohort and reperforming the
previous analyses.
For each analysis, the null hypothesis was evaluated at a
2-sided significance level of .05, and 95% confidence inter-
vals were calculated using robust standard errors. All analy-
ses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc)
and R version 2.10.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing) statistical software.
Results
An initial 117 005 patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest with
returnofspontaneouscirculationfrom674hospitalswereiden-
tified (Figure). A total of 90 822 patients were excluded: 31 565
were not linked with Medicare data, 15 012 were from hospi-
tals without hypothermia cases, 17 117 had an in-hospital car-
diac arrest prior to the first patient treated with therapeutic hy-
pothermia at their hospital, 26 429 were not on mechanical
ventilation, 69 were missing data on survival, 28 were miss-
ing data on comorbidities, and 602 had an initial out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest. The final cohort included 26 183 pa-
tients from 355 hospitals who were successfully resuscitated
after in-hospital cardiac arrest.
Overall, 1568 patients (6.0%) were treated with therapeu-
tic hypothermia. Patients treated with hypothermia were
younger, less likely to have a cardiac arrest in the intensive care
unit, and more likely to have an initial cardiac arrest rhythm

of ventricular fibrillation (Table 1). The duration of resuscita-
tion before return of spontaneous circulation was similar be-
tween patients treated with and without hypothermia, but pa-
tients with therapeutic hypothermia initiated were more likely
to have a myocardial infarction prior to their cardiac arrest and
less likely to have hypotension, respiratory insufficiency, re-
nal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, pneumonia, acute
stroke, and a metastatic or hematologic malignant neoplasm
at the time of their cardiac arrest.
The propensity score for the overall cohort had good dis-
crimination (C statistic of 0.783) and led to the successful
matchingof1524patientstreatedwithhypothermia(mean[SD]
age, 61.6 [16.2] years; 58.5% male) to 3714 patients not treated
with hypothermia (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [17.5] years; 57.1%
male). The mean (SD) age of the propensity score–matched co-
hort was 62.0 (17.5) years, 57.5% were men, and 68.0% were
white. Prior differences in age, sex, race, initial cardiac arrest
rhythm, location of arrest, and comorbidities were well bal-
anced after matching for the overall cohort (Table 1) and by
rhythm type (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Temperature data
(optional data element) were available for 364 matched pa-
tients treated with hypothermia (23.9%) and 607 not treated
with hypothermia (16.3%). The median lowest achieved tem-
perature was 33.1°C (interquartile range [IQR], 32.3°C-35.7°C)
in hypothermia-treated patients (with 76 [20.9%] below the
recommended nadir of 32°C) and 36.3°C (IQR, 35.6°C-36.8°C)
in non–hypothermia-treated patients (P < .001).
Survival to Discharge
In the overall propensity score–matched cohort, 417 patients
treated with therapeutic hypothermia (27.4%) survived to hos-
pital discharge, as compared with 1084 non–hypothermia-
treated patients (29.2%). Therapeutic hypothermia was asso-
ciated with a lower likelihood of in-hospital survival (relative
risk [RR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.97]; risk difference, −3.6%
[−6.3% to −0.9%]; P = .01), and this association was similar (in-
teraction P = .74) for nonshockable cardiac arrest rhythms
(22.2% vs 24.5%; RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.99]; risk differ-
ence, −3.2% [95% CI, −6.2% to −0.3%]) and shockable cardiac
arrestrhythms(41.3%vs44.1%;RR,0.90[95%CI,0.77to1.05];
risk difference, −4.6% [95% CI, −10.9% to 1.7%]) (Table 2).
A lower proportion of patients in the hypothermia-treated
group died during the first day than in the non–hypothermia-
treated group (29.1% vs 45.0%, respectively; P < .001). In sen-
sitivity analysis, wherein the study cohort was restricted to the
3124 propensity score–matched patients who survived the first
24 hours after cardiac arrest (59.6%), all associations between
therapeutichypothermiaandsurvivalpersisted(eTable2inthe
Supplement).Inaddition,survivalresultswerenotduetohigher
rates of de novo do-not-resuscitate orders in the hypothermia
groupafterachievingreturnofspontaneouscirculation(eTable
3 in the Supplement).
Favorable Neurological Survival
Information on favorable neurological survival was missing
for 81 hypothermia-treated patients (5.3%) and 185 non–
hypothermia-treatedpatients(5.0%).Afterexcludingthesepa-
tients,therapeutichypothermiawasassociatedwithalowerlike-
lihood of favorable neurological survival for all rhythms (246
of 1443 hypothermia-treated patients [17.0%] vs 725 of 3529
non–hypothermia-treated patients [20.5%]; RR, 0.79 [95% CI,
0.69 to 0.90]; risk difference, −4.4% [95% CI, −6.8% to −2.0%];
P < .001), with similar patterns in patients with nonshockable
andshockablerhythms(interactionP = .88)(Table2).Thesere-
sults did not change when the analyses were restricted to pro-
pensityscore–matchedpatientswhosurvivedthefirst24hours
after cardiac arrest (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
One-Year Survival
Among 2741 propensity score–matched patients successfully
linked to Medicare inpatient files, 706 patients treated with
therapeutic hypothermia were matched to 2035 non–
hypothermia-treated controls. Cumulative survival through-
out the first year was similar between the 2 groups (mean, 2.21
months [95% CI, 1.89-2.53] vs 2.20 months [95% CI, 2.02-
2.39], respectively; P = .92) (Table 3 and eFigure in the Supple-
ment). At 1 year, 100 hypothermia-treated patients (14.2%) and
286 non–hypothermia-treated patients (14.1%) were alive, and
there were no differences in 1-year survival between the 2
groups overall (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.96-1.03]; P = .94) and by
rhythm type (Table 3).
Discussion
In a large national registry, treatment with therapeutic hypo-
thermia was not associated with higher rates of survival to dis-
charge or favorable neurological survival in patients with in-
hospital cardiac arrest and was associated with potential harm.
These associations were similar for both shockable and non-
shockable cardiac arrest rhythms. When follow-up was

extended to 1 year, there remained no survival advantage with
therapeutic hypothermia treatment. Collectively, these find-
ings do not support current use of therapeutic hypothermia
for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest.
To our knowledge, there are no randomized trials of thera-
peutic hypothermia for in-hospital cardiac arrest, and obser-
vational studies are scant and have been underpowered. Kory
et al4 found no difference in rates of survival to discharge be-
tween 17 hypothermia-treated patients (24%) and 16 non–
hypothermia-treated patients (31%) (P = .62). An early study
within GWTG-Resuscitation found no difference in rates of fa-
vorable neurological survival between 214 hypothermia-
treated patients (18.7%) vs 8102 non–hypothermia-treated pa-
tients(20.1%),butthatstudyinvolvedfewpatientstreatedwith
hypothermia and did not restrict analyses to sites with hypo-
thermia capability.5 A more recent study6 reported improved
survivalamong42hypothermia-treatedpatients,butthisstudy
used a limited propensity score derived from 5 factors unre-
lated to in-hospital cardiac arrest.20 The current study ex-
tends the findings of prior studies by including a large study
sample, restricting the analyses to hospitals with therapeutic
hypothermia capability, requiring all study patients to be on
mechanical ventilation, using a robust propensity score,
examining outcomes for both shockable and nonshockable
cardiac arrest rhythms, and evaluating both in-hospital and
1-year survival.
A particular focus of this study was to assess whether un-
measured factors leading to indication bias (eg, initiating hy-
pothermia in those with a worse prognosis) influenced study
results. To address this, a sensitivity analysis that excluded pa-
tients who died within the first 24 hours after return of spon-
taneous circulation was conducted; it found that a lower pro-
portion of patients treated with hypothermia died within the
firstday.Thissuggeststhateithertherapeutichypothermiawas
protective during the first 24 hours after return of spontane-
ous circulation but was not effective overall, or that any indi-
cation bias was in favor of patients treated with hypothermia.
Another potential concern is that GWTG-Resuscitation
does not collect information on comatose status among pa-
tients resuscitated from an in-hospital cardiac arrest. To over-
come this limitation, patients were required to be on mechani-
cal ventilation at the time of, or after, cardiac arrest as a
surrogate for comatose status. Given a mean duration of car-
diopulmonary resuscitation of 16 minutes in both groups and

theadditionalrequirementofmechanicalventilation,itislikely
that only a few noncomatose patients were included in the
study cohort, and any misclassification would be expected to
be nondifferential. Nonetheless, potential indication bias
and misclassification of comatose status further suggest that
this study’
s findings warrant confirmation with a random-
ized clinical trial.
The finding that therapeutic hypothermia was not asso-
ciatedwithbettersurvivaloutcomesmayraisequestionsabout
plausibility. However, clinical trials have found that therapeu-
tichypothermialeadstoworsesurvivaloutcomesforothercon-
ditions, such as traumatic brain injury21,22 and bacterial
meningitis.23 To date, the only randomized trials to examine
therapeutichypothermiavsnotemperaturemanagementhave
been for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.2,3 In-hospital cardiac
arrest is a different condition with faster response times (me-
dian times of <1 minute to cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
1 minute to first defibrillation,24 and 3 minutes to first epi-
nephrine dose25), potentially limiting the theorized benefit of
therapeutic hypothermia to reduce free radical–mediated rep-
erfusion injury from anoxic brain injury.26 Moreover, 4 in 5 pa-
tients with in-hospital cardiac arrest have an initial rhythm of
asystole or PEA, cardiac arrest rhythms for which random-
ized trials of therapeutic hypothermia do not exist. Addition-
ally, although patients treated with hypothermia in this study
achieved, on average, a median lowest temperature of
33.1°C, which is consistent with recent trials of therapeutic
hypothermia,27 21% of patients treated with hypothermia
achieved temperatures below the recommended nadir of 32°C.
These factors may explain why therapeutic hypothermia for
in-hospitalcardiacarrestinthisregistrywasnotassociatedwith
improved short-term or long-term survival and was possibly
harmful. Since therapeutic hypothermia is not without costs,
national registries such as GWTG-Resuscitation have a unique
opportunity to conduct low-cost, large-scale, pragmatic trials
of therapeutic hypothermia treatment to establish its
efficacy for in-hospital cardiac arrest.28
This study should be interpreted in the context of the fol-
lowing limitations. First, although data available in GWTG-
Resuscitation enabled a propensity score analysis that ad-
justed for a number of key variables linked to survival after
cardiac arrest, the possibility of residual confounding re-
mains. Second, GWTG-Resuscitation did not collect detailed
data on therapeutic hypothermia protocols and treatments for
each patient; therefore, this study reflects outcomes of com-
munity implementation of hypothermia treatment. More-
over, the temperature data field was optional, so these data
were not available for most patients. The possibility remains
that the null findings for therapeutic hypothermia seen in this
study may reflect poor implementation (eg, insufficient du-
ration of hypothermia), even though the median lowest
achieved temperature was 33.1°C among patients treated with
hypothermia for whom temperature data were available. Also,
since the Targeted Management Trial for out-of-hospital car-
diac arrest was not published until December 201327 (a year
before the study period ended), the proportion of non–
hypothermia-treated patients with targeted temperature man-
agement of 36°C is likely small. Third, this study may have in-
cludedsomepatientswhowerenotcomatosefollowingcardiac
arrest. Any misclassification would be expected to be nondif-
ferential, but differential misclassification favoring the non–
hypothermia-treated group could have influenced the study
results. Fourth, results for favorable neurological survival
should be interpreted with some caution as variability in as-
sessing neurological status exists29 and some patients were
missing data on this outcome. Fifth, although GWTG-
Resuscitation is a quality improvement registry that collects
cardiac arrest data from a diverse population of US hospitals,
findings may be different in nonparticipating hospitals.
Conclusions
Among patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, use of thera-
peutic hypothermia compared with usual care was associ-
ated with a lower likelihood of survival to hospital discharge
andalowerlikelihoodoffavorableneurologicalsurvival.These
observational findings warrant a randomized clinical trial to
assess efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia for in-hospital
cardiac arrest.
