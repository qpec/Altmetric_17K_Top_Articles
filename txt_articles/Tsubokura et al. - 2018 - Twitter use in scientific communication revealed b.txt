Abstract
Scientific communication through social media, particularly Twitter has been gaining impor-
tance in recent years. As such, it is critical to understand how information is transmitted and
dispersed through outlets such as Twitter, particularly in emergency situations where there
is an urgent need to relay scientific information. The purpose of this study is to examine how
original tweets and retweets on Twitter were used to diffuse radiation related information
after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. Out of the Twitter database, we
purchased all tweets (including replies) and retweets related to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
power plant accident and or radiation sent from March 2nd, 2011 to September 15th, 2011.
This time frame represents the first six months after the East Japan earthquake, which
occurred on March 11th, 2011. Using the obtained data, we examined the number of tweets
and retweets and found that only a small number of Twitter users were the source of the
original posts that were retweeted during the study period. We have termed these specific
accounts as “influencers”. We identified the top 100 influencers and classified the contents
of their tweets into 3 groups by analyzing the document vectors of the text. Then, we exam-
ined the number of retweets for each of the 3 groups of influencers, and created a retweet
network diagram to assess how the contents of their tweets were being spread. The key-
word “radiation” was mentioned in over 24 million tweets and retweets during the study
period. Retweets accounted for roughly half (49.7%) of this number, and the top 2% of Twit-
ter accounts defined as “influencers” were the source of the original posts that accounted for
80.3% of the total retweets. The majority of the top 100 influencers had individual Twitter
accounts bearing real names. While retweets were intensively diffused within a fixed

Introduction
The term scientific communication is defined as communicating scientific information to
non-experts in the general public [1]. In this age of information overload, appropriate scien-
tific communication is critical to raise the scientific literacy of the public, to implement policies
based on evidence, and to improve the well-being of citizens [2].
It was common in the past to provide the general public with one-directional information
through classical mass media outlets such as newspapers, televisions, and radios [3]. Recently
however, social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, have been playing increasingly
important roles as media through which to disseminate and receive scientific information [4,
5]. In fact, it is estimated that approximately 60% of the general public rely on social media as a
source for scientific information [6]. Social media platforms enable real-time communication
with rapid propagation over a wide demography [7]. In regard to scientific communication
however, there are several drawbacks to using social media. In particular, there is concern
about the spread of scientifically inappropriate or inaccurate information through erroneous
rumors or hoaxes during times of natural or other disasters [8, 9]. For example, there were
prior incidences of inappropriate scientific information regarding vaccine efficacy and cancer
treatments being disseminated through social media [10]. Therefore, to use social media effec-
tively for scientific communication, it is important to identify how to make good use of the
properties of these media in the future.
Twitter is a social media platform where registered users can create posts containing up to
280 characters and attach images. At the time of this study however, the limit in place was 140
characters, and even now Japanese tweets fall outside the scope of this deregulation. Twitter
users can follow each other freely and spread information more broadly compared to Face-
book. [11]. On Twitter, the relationship between users who are followers and those who are
being followed forms a social network, and retweeting or replying to another user’s tweet is the
way to distribute and propagate information. Retweeting is the act of spreading information to
one’s followers by quoting verbatim the tweet of other users [12]. In this way Twitter can be
used to diffuse scientific information, and its role has been increasing in recent years due to its
high real-time capabilities and ease of exchanging information with other users.
The advantage of Twitter is that it allows direct communication between people who are
too far away socially as well as physically in everyday life. Especially, at the time of a social phe-
nomenon, such as a disaster that attracts public attention, related tweets rapidly increase [13].
As such, Twitter is regarded as a very useful social media tool to obtain necessary information,
spread information, and ask for help in case of a disaster [14, 15]. Despite Twitter being a plat-
form that plays a key in the exchange of current information, there are limited reports that
focus on how scientific information diffuses, and how Twitter is useful for scientific communi-
cation within the first few months after a disaster.
The Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident,
which occurred on March 11th, 2011, resulted in radioactive contamination and radiation
exposure to the public [16]. Residents in the surrounding areas had long-term radiation

 exposure and the fear of the contamination spreading resulted in social unrest across Japan
[17]. In response to this situation, one-directional and conventional scientific communication
regarding radiation was released from various government and private sources [18]. However,
in addition to a wide range of perceived problems (such as health, societal, and lifestyle) caused
by radiation pollution, there were some stakeholders making scientifically erroneous assertions
particularly about low-dose radiation and its health effects. Many conflicting opinions circu-
lated and caused confusion among the general public [19]. As a result, residents were at a loss
as to whom to believe, and the public’s trust in science itself was lost [20].
Social media, in particular Twitter, was actively used for both direct communication and
for transmission and exchange of scientific information at the time of the earthquake [21–24],
especially in the affected areas. However, many reports on the subject have only described the
phase immediately after the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident including evacuation
and logistics [25, 26], and there is insufficient information on how Twitter was used for scien-
tific communication of radiation-related issues. Assessing how Twitter was used after the radi-
ation accident is very useful in order to clarify how social media is used in the world of
scientific communication.
In the present study, we used Twitter data up to six months after the accident, to examine
how Twitter was used, especially as it relates to retweets, and to see the spreading of scientific
information on radiation. This study will provide useful information for scientists to under-
stand the background of distrust in science after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant
accident, and to better understand the method of appropriate scientific information dissemi-
nation on social media platforms, such as Twitter should there be a future crisis.
Materials and methods
Tweet and retweet data used
Tweets and retweets used in this research was purchased from NTT DATA Corporation. NTT
DATA, an IT company, is a member of NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation)
Group, the largest telecommunications company in Japan. NTT DATA is Twitter’s intermedi-
ary in Japan authorized to give customers paid access to tweets. For this research, we gave
NTT DATA a list of Japanese words, phrases and expressions related to radiation and radioac-
tivity resulting from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (Table 1). Using this list of
keywords, NTT DATA extracted and compiled the contents of tweets and retweets (including
replies) written in Japanese that were sent on between March 2nd, 2011 to September 15th,
2011 (i.e. the first six months after the Great East Japan Earthquake). This data was purchased
and used in our analysis.
All tweets extracted by NTT DATA that had at least one of the keywords and key phrases
shown in Table 1 were included in the analysis. Keywords and phrases were chosen to analyze
events and facts related to radiation and not the effects of the earthquake and tsunami; they
also did not include emotional words that expressed fear, anxiety or anger about the radiation.
All members of our research team agreed that the search terms shown in Table 1, was a highly
accurate representation of the scope of the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident and radia-
tion. Due to our allowed fiscal budget, this research was limited to 50 million tweets, as a result
"nuclear power plant" and "Fukushima" and other terms that are related, but not critical to our
research, were not used as independent search terms.
The number of tweets and retweets transmitted during the study period, and the transition
of the retweet ratio among all tweets were examined. Retweets were counted by the number of
accounts that posted the same tweet; for example, if 10 different accounts each retweeted one
tweet posted by user-A, the number of retweets was counted as ten.

 Definition of “influencers” and classification of their tweet contents
We found that the majority of the retweets were based on original posts sent out by a few hun-
dred accounts. The top 2% of accounts were the source of original posts that received 80.3% of
all retweets during the study period. Thus, the top 100 accounts that were retweeted frequently
were identified and defined as “influencers”.
To classify the contents of their tweets, we calculated tweet’s document vectors for each
influencer’s account. The method is as follows: using the text that appeared in all the tweets
used in this study and the article text of Japanese Wikipedia as corpus, each Japanese docu-
ment was separated with spaces using Japanese morphological analysis engine MeCab [27].
For the dictionary, ipadic and mecab-ipadic-neologd were used [28]. In this way we derived
390,681,577 words from 12,219,497 tweets, and 397,785,864 words from 1,072,888 Wikipedia
articles. The number of unique words combined was 171,644. Gensim version 2.3, a natural
language processing library for Python programming was used to execute Doc2Vec [29]. The
default parameter setting of genism was used for learning with 100 dimensions of the output
vector. Python code can be found in the following URL (https://github.com/likr/twitter-
analysis2018/tree/master/scripts).
K-means method was applied to the document vector to classify each influencer [30]. Of
the top 100 influencer accounts examined during the study period, 99 accounts were still active
as of June 2017. Five accounts of outliers that did not constitute the same clusters with other
influencer accounts have been removed, so 94 accounts were used for the final clustering.
First, five clusters were identified in the k-means method based on the Elbow method [31].
These five clusters were then grouped according to the contents of their tweets regarding radi-
ation and whether the clusters included media accounts or not. Finally, we classified the influ-
encers into three groups, and examined the number and the ratio of retweets over the study
period.
Visualization of radiation information spreading by influencers
In order to visualize the spread of radiation information by influencers, we built a retweet net-
work centered on influencers. A retweet network is a weighted directed graph linking the rela-
tionship that account A has retweeted influencer X for n number of times. We visualized the
center of the retweet network using only the top 20 influencers and accounts with more than 5
retweets. The Fast Multipole Multilevel Method [32] (FM3) implemented in the Open Graph
Drawing Framework [33] was used to set the coordinate positions of nodes.
Protection of personal information accompanying tweet and account data
use
The data of this study was received from Twitter, Inc. and are in accordance with the compa-
ny’s user agreement for the handling of personal information. Due to contractual agreements
with NTT DATA, the purchased data used in this study cannot be shared. However, research-
ers can purchase this data through Twitter Inc., or its local intermediary, by specifying the
same keywords and key phrases listed in Table 1. The extracted tweets and retweets will then
be similar to the ones we purchased from NTT DATA. The Twitter accounts which were used

and retweets generated from these accounts can also be viewed, although they will not be lim-
ited to those bearing our keywords listed in Table 1.
Results
Overall trends of tweet and retweet
The total number of tweets and retweets that included the keywords listed in Table 1 during
the period from March 2nd to September 15th, 2011 was 24,287,299. The number of accounts
that sent out tweets or retweets at least once was 1,397,941. Since Japanese is written without
space between words, if the Japanese words in Table 1 were a part of a sentence or ID, it was
included in the study. On the other hand, in the case of an English word like Sv, it was not
used as a search term unless it exists as an independent English word of Sv. When radio- is
searched in Japanese, compound words such as heat radiation, emissivity, radiologist, etc. are
included in the search result. Regarding contamination, it has related words such as environ-
mental pollution and nuclear pollution. In order to clarify the extent of how such unrelated
tweets are included in the present study, we randomly extracted 1000 tweets, and confirmed
that there are 116 tweets which seem to be irrelevant to the present research topic. Using that
as an estimate, we predict that unrelated tweets accounted for 11.6±2.6% of total tweets
assessed in this study. The number of tweets per account fell between 0 to 61,037 with a
median of 1; the number of retweets sent out per account was 0 to 36,716 with a median of 1.
Fig 1 shows the number of tweets and retweets per day during the study period.
The number of tweets and retweets per day that included the keywords shown in Table 1
increased sharply after March 11th, 2011 (= day 0 of the Great East Japan Earthquake). The
number remained high in the first month, but it decreased drastically after the second month
(around 100,000 cases per day). The maximum was 643,603 on March 15th, 2011 (= day 4), the
minimum was 74,274 on August 15th, 2011 (= day 157). The average number of tweets and
retweets per day for each month after the disaster was 241,529, 109,197, 120,720, 93,854,
103,953, and 99,464 (from 11th March to 10th April, from 11th April to 10th May, from 11th May
to 10th June, from 11th June to 10th July, from 11th July to 10th August, and from 11th August to
10th September, respectively). Several spikes were observed in the first month; 12th March (=
day 1), 15th March (= day 4), 16th March (= day 5), and 23rd March (= day 12) measured the
number of 400,000 or more (480, 573, 643,603, 488,555, and 500,575, respectively). After 1
month (11th April), only 12th April (= day 32) exceeded 200,000 (207,293 tweets and retweets).
During the study period, the total number of retweets was 12.07 million which accounted
for 49.7% of all tweets and retweets combined. This retweet ratio remained at around 50% dur-
ing the study period, but more precisely, it started with a downward trend one month after the
disaster and then increased slightly afterwards. The average during the first week of the disaster
was 57.3%. The weekly average one month after the earthquake (average for 7 days from 11th
April) was 41.4%, and the monthly average during August was 50.3%.
Fig 2 shows the cumulative percentage of retweets for accounts arranged in descending
order of retweet volume. While the number of accounts that received retweet at least once was
232,607, the top 100 influencers accounted for 3.76 million retweets (31.1%) out of 12.07 mil-
lion retweets. The top 200 accounts received 4.8 million retweets (40.0%), and the top 2%
accounts received 80.3% of all retweets.
Classification of influencers by Doc2Vec
The document vectors of tweets by influencers were calculated using Doc2Vec. Table 2 shows
the result of clustering influencer accounts into 5 groups by k-means method.

 Among the 94 influencers that were analyzed, 53 (56%) accounts had real names, 24 (26%)
were anonymous, and 14 (15%) were accounts for press-related companies.
In Cluster 1, ten out of 13 individual accounts had real names. Of these ten accounts, four
belonged to academia, two were journalists, and one bureaucrat. In Cluster 1, tweets tended to
rationally describe the effect of radiation based on facts, and this cluster was defined as group
A. A typical tweet is as follows:
“In 1974 China conducted atmospheric nuclear tests, and radioactive materials fell in Tokyo
with rain. I was a student then, and measured people’s hair and clothes with a Geiger counter.
The measured values were comparable or larger than those experienced at hospitals in Fukush-
ima. No health problem due to radiation exposure has been reported up to the present for the
citizens exposed then in Tokyo.”

 Cluster 2 had 21 out of 38 individual accounts with real names. Two accounts belong to aca-
demia, four businessmen, three journalists, and three politicians. In Cluster 3, 21 of the 25
individual accounts had real names. Among them, three accounts belonged to academia, with
five journalists and six politicians.

 Both Cluster 2 and cluster 3 had many emotional tweets, and criticisms against the govern-
ment and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Since these two clusters had similar
tweet contents regarding radiation, we combined them to create group B. The contents of
tweets concerning radiation among group B differed from those among group A. A typical
tweet is below:
“I will repeat it many times! To buy and eat radioactively polluted agricultural and fishery
products is showing "support for TEPCO" rather than "assistance for victims"! Why should
consumers, at the expense of their own health, help with the damage that should be compen-
sated for by TEPCO? Stop doing this stupid thing now! Do you want to save TEPCO until your
children develop thyroid cancer?”
Cluster 5 consisted of 7 news agencies and one individual account of a journalist. Since
clusters 4 and 5 were accounts related to mass media, these two clusters were collectively
shown as group C for subsequent counting.
Trends of retweets in the three influencer groups
Fig 3 shows (a) the number and (b) the proportion of retweets that each influencer group
accounted for out of the total retweets. At the beginning of the disaster, the number of retweets
received by group A influencers was almost equal to that of group B, but after one month
group B received the majority of retweets, and the situation remained unchanged afterwards.
Tweets posted by group C received the lowest number of retweets. Specific bumps were
observed in group B in the middle of May and in the middle of July.

encers’ node indicates the total number of retweets and their group, respectively. Nodes that
do not bear the color of any influencer, shows the color of the group whose messages the
group retweeted the most. The link density represents the number of retweets. Overall,
retweets of group B’s posts were dominant. Inside each group were there many retweet

 interactions, whereas the number of retweets between groups were relatively small. Among
each respective group, especially in group B, a tight network was built by the influencers at the
hub who frequently retweeted each other’s contents. The network diagram would be uploaded

Discussion
Scientific communication on SNS (social networking service) has become increasingly
important. However, in emergency situations such as a natural disaster where scientific

 communication is necessary, little is known about how much scientific information is spread
and transmitted on Twitter.
Of note, retweets account for roughly half of all the radiation-related tweets and retweets
posted within half a year after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. The
majority of the original posts that were retweeted were sent out by accounts defined as “influ-
encers”. In this study, retweets accounted for 49.7% of all tweets and retweets combined. The
top 100 accounts received 31.1% of retweets, and the top 200 accounts received 40.0%.
Although future research is necessary regarding the extent to which the number of retweets
themselves represent the information spreading power of Twitter, our data suggests that it is
possible that the majority of information on Twitter is being supplied by very few sources.
These findings are comparable to past research results dealing with tweets not related to radia-
tion, such as hate speech targeting foreigners in Japan [34]. Twitter is a social media platform
with a high degree of free interaction between individual accounts, but in terms of information
spreading, retweets account for half of the total. Influencers can have a stronger impact on
information transmitted to the general public rather than the interaction between individuals.
In this study, the majority of influencers (54%) had their personal names attached to their
Twitter accounts. News agencies accounted for 15% of influencers, and had a small number of
retweets throughout the study period as shown in Fig 3. Some group accounts, which were
socially important but not identified by personal names, such as news media and government
agencies, did not have a strong influence on information propagation. This result is consistent
with a past report showing that Japanese government’s tweets were no longer being retweeted
once public concerns and doubts have become too strong [35]. These findings suggest that
individual accounts bearing real names had more influence on the spread of radiation related
information than other accounts. Since there were various opinions on radiation, the general
public had trouble ascertaining which information was scientifically correct; and perhaps,
judging whether the content of tweet was correct or not, depended on if the sender could be
trusted. Scientists should avoid transmitting scientific information in a closed society within
their affiliated organizations or open to the public but in an anonymous manner during events
that cause social debate such as nuclear accidents and radiation exposure. Although it could
give us useful information on how to effectively transmit scientific information, our study has
not revealed the mechanism of information spreading by influencers. A further study on their
tweets, including those with topics other than radiation, would give us some hint for an effec-
tive way of transmitting scientific information to the public.
Interestingly, the ratio of tweets sent by influencers stayed fairly constant since the first
month. In the early days after the accident, posts made by group A, B and C were all frequently
retweeted; however, the number of retweets received by group A and C showed a rapid
decrease, and messages by group B received the majority of retweets one month after the disas-
ter. This tendency remained unchanged over the next six months even after credible scientific
information became widely available such as actual measured radiation doses in the environ-
ment. We did not investigate why the share of group A and C rapidly reduced, and group B
maintained its dominance. We did observe however that group B’s tweets were more emo-
tional than the other groups and involved many criticisms against the government and
TEPCO. Such tweets may be easier to propagate widely through SNS than science-based and
less emotional information. Scientists should recognize that such emotional exchanges tend to
occupy the majority of posts made on SNS. Further research is necessary to understand how to
effectively convey scientific but not emotional information through SNS.
The results in this study suggest that retweets were intensively spread within a fixed popula-
tion, especially within groups with similar document vectors, while intercommunication
among groups with different document vectors was small (see Fig 4). These findings are

 analogous to the fact that at the time of the United States presidential election, each camp
accessed only the information its own camp posted on Twitter [36]. While influencers were
eventually classified into three groups in the present study, there seems to be a discontinuity in
information spreading in group A and B as can be seen in the network diagram (Fig 4).
Although this research did not carefully examine the contents of each tweet, the sentiment of
tweets concerning safety and danger of radiation is firmly fixed within each group, and the
contents of tweets exchanged within each group were clearly differentiated. In group A, infor-
mation on radiation was transmitted based on relevant scientific evidence, whereas in group B
the majority sent out cautionary messages, over-emphasizing or exaggerating the danger of
radiation. Therefore, when members of the general public tried to acquire information on
radiation, they may have been exposed only to biased information depending on which group
of influencers they were following with their Twitter account. Twitter is an interactive social
media platform, but information regarding radiological issues was spread mainly through
retweeting influencers’ messages; as a result, individuals were found to have received only
biased information from a limited number of influencers.
The present study is suggestive when considering how government and international orga-
nizations communicate scientific information to the public. As shown in the present study,
information on SNS is not limited to only those that are scientifically correct. Contents that
are perceived to be more emotional and eye-catching tend be propagated more. A lot of infor-
mation in Twitter is spread by influencers sharing information with each other. For this rea-
son, the method of unifying the information sources and providing information to the public
only from specified organizations is not necessarily optimal as a method of distributing infor-
mation to the public. Scientists and stakeholders will have to link each other and distribute
information in cooperation. In addition, although discussion and public dialogue are impor-
tant to deepen mutual consent and understanding of controversial issues such as radiation [37,
38], attention must be paid to the possibility that a two-way communication tool like Twitter
could be used unilaterally by influencers to spread their own agenda.
Conclusion
The results of this study showed that retweets account for roughly half of all the tweets related to
radiation within half a year after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. The major-
ity of the retweets were based on original posts sent out by a few hundred accounts defined as
“influencers”. The majority of influencers had individual accounts with real names. While the ratio
of information spreading by influencers was established and fixed in the first month, retweets were
intensively spread within fixed population, especially within groups with similar tweet contents.
