 Methods: Patients were randomized to guselkumab 100 mg (weeks 0 and 4, then every 8 weeks; n = 329);
placebo/guselkumab (weeks 0, 4, and 12 then guselkumab at weeks 16 and 20, then every 8 weeks;
n = 174); or adalimumab (80 mg week 0, 40 mg week 1, then 40 mg every 2 weeks through week 47;
n = 334). Physician-reported outcomes (Investigator Global Assessment, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index
[PASI]), patient-reported outcomes (Dermatology Life Quality Index, Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary),
and safety were evaluated through week 48.
Results: Guselkumab was superior (P \.001) to placebo at week 16 (85.1% vs 6.9% [Investigator Global
Assessment score of 0/1 (cleared/minimal)] and 73.3% vs 2.9% [90% or greater improvement in PASI score
from baseline (PASI 90)]). Guselkumab was also superior (P \.001) to adalimumab for Investigator Global
Assessment 0/1 and PASI 90 at week 16 (85.1% vs 65.9% and 73.3% vs 49.7%), week 24 (84.2% vs 61.7% and
80.2% vs 53.0%), and week 48 (80.5% vs 55.4% and 76.3% vs 47.9%). Furthermore, guselkumab significantly
improved patient-reported outcomes through week 48. Adverse event rates were comparable between
treatments.
Limitations: Analyses were limited to 48 weeks.
Conclusions: Guselkumab demonstrated superior efficacy compared with adalimumab and was well
tolerated in patients with psoriasis through 1 year. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2017;76:405-17.)

IL-1714-16 and IL-23 alone.17-21
Guselkumab
(CNTO
1959; Janssen Research & Development LLC, Spring
House, PA) is a fully human IgG1 lambda mono-
clonal antibody that binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23
and
inhibits
the
intracellular
and
downstream
signaling of IL-23, which is required for terminal
differentiation and survival of T helper (Th)17 cells.22
To confirm earlier findings, we conducted 2 pivotal,
phase III trials: VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2. We report
efficacy, safety, and patient-reported outcome find-
ings from VOYAGE 1, which compared guselkumab
with adalimumab, a widely
used TNF-a inhibitor, and
placebo in patients with pso-
riasis
treated
continuously
for 1 year. Findings from
VOYAGE 2, which included
a

CAPSULE SUMMARY
d Phase II data demonstrated superior
efficacy of guselkumab compared with
adalimumab in moderate to severe
psoriasis.
d The phase III VOYAGE 1 study validates
the superiority of guselkumab compared
with adalimumab, including in difficult-
to-treat regional disease, through 1 year
of treatment.
d Our results, which show guselkumab is
superior to adalimumab for clearing
moderate to severe psoriasis, will help
clinicians make informed treatment
decisions.

Study design
VOYAGE 1 (NCT02207231) was a phase III, ran-
domized, double-blind, placebo- and active compa-
ratorecontrolled trial conducted at 101 global sites
(December 2014-April 2016). The study comprised
an active-comparator period when guselkumab was
compared with adalimumab (week 0-48) and a
placebo-controlled period (weeks 0-16), after which
patients taking placebo crossed over to receive
guselkumab through week 48 (Fig 1). Patients were
randomized using a permuted block method at
baseline in a 2:1:2 ratio to guselkumab 100 mg at
weeks 0, 4, 12, and every 8 weeks through week 44;
placebo at weeks 0, 4, and 12 followed by
guselkumab 100 mg at weeks 16 and 20, and every
8 weeks through week 44; or adalimumab 80 mg at
week 0, 40 mg at week 1, and 40 mg every 2 weeks
through
week
47.
Central
randomization
was
implemented using an interactive World Wide Web
response
system
(Perceptive
Informatics,
East
Windsor, NJ). To maintain the blind, matching
placebos were used. An institutional review board
or ethics committee approved the study protocol at
participating
sites;
patients
provided
written
informed consent before study initiation.
Assessments
Efficacy was evaluated using the IGA, PASI,24 scalp-
specific IGA, fingernail Physician Global Assessment
(f-PGA), Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI),25 and
Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of the hands and/
or feet (Table I). Patient-reported outcomes were
assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index
(DLQI)26 and Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary
(PSSD)27,28 (Table I). Safety monitoring included
collection of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory
testing. Antibodies to guselkumab were detected
using a highly sensitive and drug-tolerant electro-
chemiluminescence immunoassay (sensitivity: 3.1 ng/
mL in guselkumab-free serum and 15 ng/mL with
serum guselkumab concentrations #3.125 �g/mL,
exceeding mean trough serum guselkumab levels).
Statistical analyses
Coprimary end points were the proportions of
patients achieving an IGA score of cleared/minimal
disease (IGA 0/1) and 90% or greater improvement in
PASI score from baseline (PASI 90) at week 16 in the
guselkumab group compared with placebo. The
primary and major secondary analyses were tested in
a fixed sequence to control for multiplicity (Table II).
All randomized patients were included in the primary
and selected secondary efficacy analyses; data were
analyzed by randomized treatment group.
The coprimary end points and binary major
secondary
end
points
were
analyzed
using
a
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel x2 statistical test stratified
by investigator site. With a sample size of approxi-
mately 750 patients, the power to detect a significant
difference was more than 99% for both coprimary
end points. Continuous response parameters were
compared using an analysis of variance model with
investigator site as a covariate. All statistical testing
was performed 2-sided (a = 0.05).
Patients who discontinued study agent because of
lack ofefficacy or an AE ofpsoriasis worsening or who
started a protocol-prohibited psoriasis treatment were
considered nonresponders (binary end points) or had
baseline values carried over (continuous end points).
Other patients with missing data were considered
nonresponders for binary end points (nonresponder
imputation) and had last observation carried forward
for continuous end points (and all PSSD end points).
Safety analyses included all patients receiving at
least 1 study agent administration and were summa-
rized by actual treatment. The proportion of patients
with antibodies to guselkumab was summarized for
those receiving at least 1 dose of the biologic.
RESULTS
At baseline, 837 patients were randomized to
placebo (n = 174), guselkumab (n = 329), or
adalimumab (n = 334). Overall, 6.9% (12 of 174),
8.5% (28 of 329), and 15.6% (52 of 334) of patients

 discontinued treatment in the placebo, guselkumab,
and adalimumab groups, respectively, through week
48 (Fig 2). Demographic and disease characteristics
were
comparable
across
treatment
groups
at
baseline (Tables III and IV).
Clinical responses
Guselkumab was superior to placebo and/or ada-
limumab for the coprimary end points and all major
secondary end points (all P \.001). Compared with
placebo, significantly higher proportions of patients
taking guselkumab achieved IGA 0/1 (6.9% vs 85.1%)
and PASI 90 (2.9% vs 73.3%) at week 16 (Fig 3 and
Table V). In addition, the proportions achieving 75%
or greater improvement in PASI score from baseline
(PASI 75) along with IGA 0 and 100% improvement in
PASI score from baseline (PASI 100) were significantly
higher for guselkumab versus placebo at week 16
(Fig 3 and Table V). Guselkumab was superior to
adalimumab as measured by the proportion of pa-
tients achieving IGA 0/1 (85.1% vs 65.9%), PASI 90
(73.3% vs 49.7%), and PASI 75 (91.2% vs 73.1%) at
week 16 (Fig 3 and Table V). Significantly better
responses to guselkumab compared with adalimumab
were maintained at week 24 (IGA 0 [52.6% vs 29.3%],
IGA 0/1 [84.2% vs 61.7%], and PASI 90 [80.2% vs
53.0%]) and at week 48 (50.5% vs 25.7%, 80.5% vs
55.4%, and 76.3% vs 47.9%, respectively) (Fig 3 and
Table V). Likewise, PASI 100 responses in the gusel-
kumab group were significantly better than those in
the adalimumab group at weeks 24 and 48 (P\.001).
In addition, higher proportions of patients taking
guselkumab attained response in higher PASI cate-
gories compared with adalimumab at week 48 (Fig 4).
After initiating guselkumab at week 16, patients in the
placebo cross-over group achieved responses similar
to those observed in the guselkumab group (Fig 3).
Regional psoriasis measures
Regional
psoriasis
was
evaluated
based
on
assessments using scalp-specific IGA; f-PGA; NAPSI;
and PGA of the hands and/or feet as described in
Table I. The proportion of patients in the guselkumab
group achieving scalp-specific IGA 0/1 (absent/very
mild
scalp
psoriasis)
was
significantly
higher
compared with placebo (83.4% vs 14.5%, P \.001)
at week 16; significantly better responses to guselku-
mab versus adalimumab were observed at weeks 24
and 48 (both P \.001) (Table V). The proportion of
patients achieving f-PGA 0/1 (cleared/minimal) and
percent
improvement
in
NAPSI
score
were
significantly higher for guselkumab versus placebo
at week 16 (P \.001) (Table V). Although the f-PGA
responses were comparable at week 24, guselkumab
was superior to adalimumab by week 48 (P = .038,
Table V). Mean percent improvements in NAPSI
score were comparable between guselkumab and
adalimumab at weeks 24 and 48 (Table V). The
proportion of patients achieving PGA 0/1 of the
hands and/or feet (clear/almost clear) was signifi-
cantly higher for guselkumab versus placebo at week
16, and responses to guselkumab were superior to

 adalimumab at week 24 (P \ .001) and week 48
(P \.045) (Table V).
HRQoL measures
At week 16, improvement from baseline in DLQI
score was significantly greater for guselkumab
compared with placebo (mean change �11.2 vs
�0.6), as were the proportions of patients achieving
DLQI score 0/1 (no impact of psoriasis on HRQoL)
(both P \.001) (Table V). At weeks 24 and 48, both
improvements from baseline in DLQI score and
proportions of patients achieving DLQI 0/1 were
significantly higher for guselkumab versus adalimu-
mab (P \.001) (Table V).
At week 16, the improvement from baseline in
PSSD symptom score was significantly greater for
guselkumab versus placebo (mean change �41.9 vs
�3.0); mean changes in PSSD sign score were
similarly favorable for guselkumab (both P \ .001)
(Table V). Likewise, at weeks 24 and 48, mean
changes in PSSD scores for guselkumab were
significantly greater than those for adalimumab
(P \ .001) (Table V). The proportions of patients
achieving
a
PSSD
symptom
score
of
0
with
guselkumab and adalimumab, respectively, were
36.3% and 21.6% at week 24, and the significantly
better response to guselkumab was maintained at
week 48 (P\.001). Similar results were observed for
the proportions of patients achieving a PSSD sign
score of 0 at weeks 24 and 48 (P \.001) (Table V).
Safety outcomes
During the placebo-controlled period (weeks 0-
16), the proportion of patients with at least 1 AE was
comparable across treatment groups, and the most
commonly reported events were nasopharyngitis and
Table I. Overall psoriasis, regional psoriasis, and health-related quality of life assessments
Assessment
Description and rating scale
IGA
Investigator Global Assessment
At a given time point, psoriatic lesions are graded by the investigator
for induration, erythema, and scaling on a scale of 0-4: cleared (0),
minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4).
PASI
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index
The severity of psoriatic lesions is assessed in 4 body regions: the
head, trunk, and upper and lower extremities, which account for
10%, 30%, 20%, and 40% of the total BSA, respectively. Each of
these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration, and
scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0-4. Total score ranges
from 0-72; a higher score indicates more severe disease.
ss-IGA
Scalp-Specific Investigator
Global Assessment
Scalp lesions are assessed in terms of clinical signs of redness,
thickness, and scaliness and are scored on a 5-point scale:
0 = absence of disease, 1 = very mild disease, 2 = mild disease,
3 = moderate disease, 4 = severe disease.
NAPSI
Nail Psoriasis Severity Index
A target nail (ie, the nail most affected by psoriasis) is divided into
quadrants, which are examined for the presence of nail matrix
psoriasis (ie, pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, nail plate
crumbling) and nail bed psoriasis (ie, onycholysis, oil drop
dyschromia, splinter hemorrhages, subungual hyperkeratosis) on a
scale of 0-4; total score ranges from 0-8; higher scores indicate
more severe disease.
f-PGA
Fingernail Physician Global Assessment
The overall condition of the fingernails is assessed on a 5-point scale:
0 = clear, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe.
hf-PGA
Physician Global Assessment
of Hands and/or Feet
The severity of psoriasis plaques on the palms and soles is scored on a
5-point scale: 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate,
and 4 = severe.
DLQI
Dermatology Life Quality Index
Ten questions related to the effect of skin problems on aspects of life
(ie, symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school
performance, personal relationships, and treatment) during the
previous week are answered by the patient, for an overall score of
0-30. A higher score indicates more severe disease.
PSSD
Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary
Symptoms (ie, itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and
signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness,
and bleeding) of psoriasis are graded (0-10 scale) by the patient in a
daily diary. A higher score indicates more severe symptoms and
signs of psoriasis.

 upper respiratory tract infection (Table VI). Serious
AEs and AEs leading to study agent discontinuation
occurred infrequently and in similar proportions of
patients for each treatment (Table VI). Rates of overall
infections and infections requiring antibiotic treat-
ment were comparable across treatment groups
(Table VI). Two patients in the adalimumab group
experienced serious infections (both cellulitis). One
nonmelanoma skin cancer (ie, basal cell carcinoma)
was reported in the guselkumab group, and no other
malignancies occurred in any group. One myocardial
infarction (ie, major adverse cardiovascular event)
occurred in each of the guselkumab and adalimumab
groups through week 16.
The types and patterns of AEs reported through
week 48 were similar to those reported during the
placebo-controlled period (Table VI). The propor-
tions of patients with at least 1 AE, an AE leading to
discontinuation, or a serious AE were similar in the
guselkumab and adalimumab groups (Table VI).
Between weeks 16 and 48, serious infections were
reported in 2 patients in the guselkumab group (ie,
thigh abscess and cellulitis
with
postoperative
wound infection) and 2 patients in the adalimumab
group (ie, abdominal abscess and staphylococcal
pneumonia with a fatal outcome). Overall infections
and
infections
requiring
antibiotic
treatment
occurred at comparable rates across treatment
groups (Table VI). Two additional nonmelanoma
skin cancers (ie, 1 basal cell carcinoma each in the

 group) were reported through week 48. No addi-
tional major adverse cardiovascular event occurred
after week 16. A single suicide attempt was reported
in a patient taking adalimumab. Incidence rates of
candidiasis and neutropenia were low and compa-
rable between groups, and no events of Crohn’s
disease were reported through week 48.
Through week 48, the proportion of patients with
an injection site reaction (ISR) (2.2% vs 9.0%) and the
proportion of injections associated with ISRs (0.5% vs
1.2%) were lower for guselkumab compared with
adalimumab; most ISRs were mild. Rates of abnormal
laboratory results were low, and no between-group
differences were noted. Antibodies to guselkumab
were detected in 26 of 492 patients (5.3%) through
week 44; titers were generally low (81% #1:320). No
association was observed between antibody deve-
lopment and reduced efficacy or ISR occurrence.
DISCUSSION
Our findings, together with the VOYAGE 2
results,23 confirm that 2 injections of guselkumab
100 mg (weeks 0 and 4) and maintenance therapy
every 8 weeks effectively treats moderate to severe
psoriasis. Guselkumab was superior to placebo by
substantial margins at week 16 using 2 rigorous end
points (IGA 0/1 and PASI 90). The onset of action of
guselkumab was rapid, with significant response as
early as week 2 compared with placebo. Guselkumab
was also superior to adalimumab, which is a widely
used and effective subcutaneous TNF-a inhibitor, at
the week-16 end points of IGA 0/1, PASI 90, and PASI
75. Response rates continued to improve with gusel-
kumab beyond week 16. At weeks 24 and 48,
approximately half of all patients in the guselkumab
group achieved complete clearance (IGA 0), which is
associated with optimal HRQoL for patients with
psoriasis.29,30 Patient-reported outcome end points
(PSSD and DLQI) based on total change, or indicating
minimal/no impact on HRQoL or no symptoms or
signs of psoriasis, demonstrated guselkumab re-
sponses superior to placebo at week 16 and adali-
mumab at weeks 24 and 48.
This study assessed multiple body areas where
psoriasis is challenging to treat, and guselkumab was
highly effective in all regions. Guselkumab was
superior to placebo at week 16 and to adalimumab
at weeks 24 and 48, indicating complete or nearly
complete clearance of scalp and hand/foot psoriasis
in at least 75% of guselkumab-treated patients. Based
on both the proportion of patients with clear/
minimal fingernail psoriasis (f-PGA 0/1) and the
mean percent improvement in NAPSI score, gusel-
kumab was superior to placebo at week 16. Nail
responses were comparable between active treat-
ments at weeks 24 and 48, and guselkumab was
superior to adalimumab for f-PGA 0/1 at week 48.
Rates and types of AEs, serious AEs, and abnormal
laboratory results were generally comparable between
the guselkumab and placebo groups through week 16,
and between the guselkumab and adalimumab
groups through week 48. Rates of serious infections,

groups. No notable differences in the incidence of
neutropenia or candidiasis were observed between
the guselkumab and control groups. No AEs of
Crohn’s disease occurred in any treatment group,
and 1 suicide attempt was reported in the adalimumab
group. The number of injections and proportions of
patients with ISRs were higher for adalimumab
compared with guselkumab. The size and duration
of this study may not allow for assessment of uncom-
mon events or those with a long latency; however,
longer-term guselkumab treatment is being evaluated
in ongoing study extensions.

 VOYAGE 1 confirms the role of IL-23 in the
pathogenesis of psoriasis. When compared with
TNF-a blockade, selective targeting of the IL-23
pathway provides more psoriasis-specific cytokine
inhibition with a higher degree of efficacy while
maintaining a favorable safety profile.31 IL-23 is a
key driver of Th17 cell differentiation and survival and
an upstream regulator of IL-17A, a central proinflam-
matory effector cytokine implicated in psoriasis
pathogenesis.32-34
Moreover,
IL-23
stimulates
production of other Th17 cytokines (eg, IL-22) by
other celltypes, including innatelymphoid type 3 cells
and gd T cells.35-37 Therefore, inhibition of IL-23
blocks downstream production of IL-17A and IL-22 by
Th17 cells and other cell types. Because many IL-17A-
producing cells are dependent on IL-23 for survival,
inhibition of IL-23 may reduce the number of these
pathogenic cells.38 This may explain the long duration
of effect and allow for the convenient dosing interval
of guselkumab compared with both antieTNF-a and
anti-IL-17 agents.39-43
Our findings, together with those from VOYAGE
2,23 demonstrate the superior efficacy of guselkumab
compared with adalimumab in psoriasis, including
regional disease of the scalp, nails, and hands/feet,
and a positive safety profile. Although the well-
characterized long-term safety findings reported for
a related treatment that blocks both IL-12 and IL-23
(ustekinumab)44-46 provides relevant information for
selective
blockade
of
IL-23
with
guselkumab,
ongoing study extensions will be important for
defining the efficacy and safety of guselkumab
beyond the 1-year period reported here.
