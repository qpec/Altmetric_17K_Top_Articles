ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To evaluate the implementation of four high evidence 
practices for the care of very preterm infants to assess 
their use and impact in routine clinical practice and 
whether they constitute a driver for reducing mortality 
and neonatal morbidity.
Design
Prospective multinational population based 
observational study.
setting
19 regions from 11 European countries covering 
850 000 annual births participating in the EPICE 
(Effective Perinatal Intensive Care in Europe for very 
preterm births) project.
PartiCiPants
7336 infants born between 24+0 and 31+6 weeks’ 
gestation in 2011/12 without serious congenital 
anomalies and surviving to neonatal admission.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Combined use of four evidence based practices for 
infants born before 28 weeks’ gestation using an “all 
or none” approach: delivery in a maternity unit with 
appropriate level of neonatal care; administration of 
antenatal corticosteroids; prevention of hypothermia 
(temperature on admission to neonatal unit ≥36°C); 
surfactant used within two hours of birth or early 
nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Infant 
outcomes were in-hospital mortality, severe neonatal 
morbidity at discharge, and a composite measure of 
death or severe morbidity, or both. We modelled 
associations using risk ratios, with propensity score 
weighting to account for potential confounding bias. 
Analyses were adjusted for clustering within delivery 
hospital.
results
Only 58.3% (n=4275) of infants received all 
evidence based practices for which they were 
eligible. Infants with low gestational age, growth 
restriction, low Apgar scores, and who were born on 
the day of maternal admission to hospital were less 
likely to receive evidence based care. After 
adjustment, evidence based care was associated 
with lower in-hospital mortality (risk ratio 0.72, 95% 
confidence interval 0.60 to 0.87) and in-hospital 
mortality or severe morbidity, or both (0.82, 0.73 to 
0.92), corresponding to an estimated 18% decrease 
in all deaths without an increase in severe 
morbidity if these interventions had been provided 
to all infants.
COnClusiOns
More comprehensive use of evidence based practices 
in perinatal medicine could result in considerable 
gains for very preterm infants, in terms of increased 
survival without severe morbidity.
Introduction
Very preterm infants—those born before 32 weeks’ ges-
tation—represent fewer than 2% of all births but up to 
half of infant deaths.1  For survivors, the risks of cere-
bral palsy, visual and auditory deficits, cognitive 
impairments, psychiatric disorders, and behavioural 
problems are much higher than for children born at 
term.2 Ensuring the best outcomes for very preterm 
infants is essential for their future health and develop-
ment and for reducing the burden for families and 
healthcare and social systems.
Wide disparities in the risk adjusted mortality and 
morbidity of very preterm infants across countries and 
neonatal units suggests that substantial gains are pos-
sible using current medical knowledge.3-7  Research 
comparing the care of very preterm infants across coun-
tries and units supports this assertion, as practices are 
not always consistent with the latest scientific evi-
dence, including non-use of treatments shown to be 
effective and safe and use of others for which evidence 
is limited or where safety is of concern.8-13
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Very preterm infants face high risks of mortality and severe neonatal morbidity 
compared with infants born at term
Effective perinatal interventions exist to improve survival and reduce neonatal 
morbidity
Country and unit variations in very preterm outcome are large and may reflect 
suboptimal use of evidence based care
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Only 58.3% of very preterm infants admitted for neonatal care in 19 European 
regions received all of the four evidence based practices for which they were 
eligible
These very preterm infants had higher risk adjusted survival without severe 
morbidity, suggesting more comprehensive provision of evidence based practices 
could yield substantial gains
The study’s findings support the growing focus on bundling effective practices to 
improve processes of care and to achieve best outcomes

The promotion of applied evidence based care may 
thus be an important driver for achieving better out-
comes in this high risk population, as shown in other 
areas of medicine.14-17  Research from many medical 
specialties has highlighted the challenges of translat-
ing even convincing scientific knowledge into practice 
because of organisational, cultural, or personal barri-
ers.18-20 Moreover, although evidence based interven-
tions are shown to be effective in clinical trials, the 
selection criteria applied to achieve equipoise and 
ensure rigorous implementation of the protocol may 
limit the generalisability of results to the overall popu-
lation of patients. It is thus necessary to improve 
knowledge on the use of interventions by clinicians 
and health planners and their impact in unselected 
populations.
The EPICE (Effective Perinatal Intensive Care in 
Europe) project established a population based 
cohort of very preterm infants in 19 regions in 11 
European countries to investigate the use of evidence 
based practices and their association with outcomes 
in real life clinical settings. We investigated the use of 
four practices that have a high level of evidence for 
the care of very preterm infants and measured their 
association with mortality or neonatal morbidity, 
or both.
Methods
Study design
The EPICE cohort is a geographically defined prospec-
tive study of all very preterm stillborn and liveborn 
infants from 22+0 weeks to 31+6 weeks of gestation, 
delivered in all public and private maternity hospitals 
in 19 regions in 11 European countries covering over 
850 000 births annually: Belgium (Flanders), Den-
mark (eastern region), Estonia (entire country), France 
(Burgundy, Ile-de-France, and the northern region), 
Germany (Hesse and Saarland), Italy (Emilia-Ro-
magna, Lazio, and Marche), the Netherlands (central 
and eastern region), Poland (Wielkopolska), Portugal 
(Lisbon and northern region), Sweden (greater Stock-
holm), and the United Kingdom (East Midlands, north-
ern, and Yorkshire and Humber regions). Regions were 
selected for geographical and organisational diversity, 
feasibility (on-site infrastructure and expertise for 
implementing the protocol), and sample size consider-
ations. Data were collected on births occurring 
between April 2011 and September 2012; in each region 
inclusions occurred over 12 months, except in France 
(six months).
Investigators abstracted data from medical records in 
obstetrical and neonatal units using a pretested 
 
standardised questionnaire with common definitions. 
Gestational age was defined as the best obstetric assess-
ment based on information on last menstrual period 
and antenatal ultrasound examinations, which are part 
of routine obstetrical care in all regions. When there 
were several estimates, we used the following hierarchy 
to determine gestational age for the study: in vitro 
 
fertilisation treatment, ultrasound result based on ear-
liest estimate, last menstrual period, fundal height 
 
measurement, and neonatal assessment at birth. We 
cross checked inclusions against delivery ward registers 
or another external data source. Infants were followed 
up until discharge home from hospital or into long term 
care or death.
Patient involvement
The EPICE study included a European parent organisa-
tion in stakeholder meetings about the project’s prelim-
inary results and analyses, including this study. EPICE 
maintains contact with parents in the cohort through 
regional newsletters, letters, and its website. A Euro-
pean parent organisation is part of our consortium for 
follow-up studies of the cohort.
study population
The study population comprised all infants without 
severe congenital anomalies born at 24+0 to 31+6 
weeks’ gestation and admitted to a neonatal unit 
(n=7336 infants delivered in 335 maternity units and 
admitted to 242 neonatal units). We excluded infants 
born before 24 weeks’ gestation because there is no con-
sensus across the regions about active treatment for 
these births21  (n=301 live births). Infants with severe 
congenital anomalies were excluded because of 
regional differences in screening and termination poli-
cies (n=126).22 We also excluded infants who died on the 
labour ward (n=112 ≥24 weeks’ gestation) because the 
EPICE database does not contain information on the 
degree of emergency in these cases, condition at birth, 
or neonatal resuscitation practices, and we were con-
cerned that these cases were often situations where 
there was no opportunity to provide evidence based 
care. Furthermore, we surmised that reverse causality 
could be present—that is, a decision against active man-
agement could explain non-implementation of evi-
dence based practices. Finally, we excluded out of 
hospital births that were unlikely to result in evidence 
based care (n=26).
Definition of evidence based care: using an all or 
none approach
We used an all or none approach to study the use of evi-
dence based practices. In contrast with an item by item 
assessment of performance or the creation of a compos-
ite measure, this approach considers whether all mea-
sures have been provided to each eligible patient.23 
 
A restrained set of indicators is selected that should 
measure performance on the specified elements of good 
care and be related to the desired outcomes.23  The 
EPICE protocol included 17 practices with varying levels 
of evidence, from which we identified four with a high 
level of evidence that are related to neonatal mortality 
and morbidity and that could be measured reliably 
using information from medical records (see supple-
mentary table S1). Some evidence based practices 
included in EPICE were not retained because they are 
evaluated with respect to longer term outcomes, such as 
screening for retinopathy of prematurity. Others were 
not selected because the evidence is not of highest qual-
ity and therefore unlikely to be consensually adopted in

all regions, such as active management of patent ductus 
arteriosus.24 We then established minimum thresholds 
for evidence based care that would be accepted across 
all regions.
Selected indicators were: delivery in a maternity 
unit with appropriate neonatal care services25  using 
national level of care designations (see supplementary 
table S2); any administration of antenatal corticoste-
roids before delivery26 ; effective prevention of hypo-
thermia, defined as a temperature on admission of 
36°C or more that corresponds to the lower limit of 
current recommendations27 28 ; and surfactant used 
within two hours after birth or early nasal continuous 
positive airway pressure for infants born before 28 
weeks’ gestation.29 30 We computed a variable measur-
ing the receipt of all practices, given each infant’s eli-
gibility.
Outcomes
Our outcomes were in-hospital mortality, defined as 
death before discharge home or into long term 
 
paediatric care; severe neonatal morbidity among 
infants discharged alive; and a composite of in-hospi-
tal mortality or severe neonatal morbidity, or both. 
Severe neonatal morbidity comprised intraventricular 
haemorrhage grade III or IV, cystic periventricular leu-
komalacia, retinopathy of prematurity stages III to V, 
and severe necrotising enterocolitis. Intraventricular 
haemorrhage grades were determined using Papile’s 
classification,31  and we recorded periventricular leu-
komalacia only if cystic abnormalities were present on 
ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging scans. 
Severe necrotising enterocolitis was assessed by sur-
gery or peritoneal drainage because Bell stages were 
not routinely recorded in all regions. We did not 
include bronchopulmonary dysplasia because large 
regional variability in respiratory management and 
oxygen saturation targets affect rates of this outcome 
variable.32
Covariables
We identified clinical and healthcare factors likely to 
influence both the probability of receiving evidence 
based care and our outcomes based on the scientific lit-
erature and biological plausibility. These factors 
included gestational age, sex, multiple pregnancy, 
pregnancy complications (preterm premature rupture 
of membranes, eclampsia or pre-eclampsia, and hae-
molysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) 
syndrome), small for gestational age , type of delivery 
(prelabour caesarean section, intrapartum caesarean 
section, vaginal), and Apgar score at five minutes. We 
categorised small for gestational age as less than the 
third and less than the 10th centile for gestational age 
and sex with Hadlock’s references adapted to national 
population values using Gardosi’s model.33 We also 
identified cases where the birth was more likely to have 
been unexpected, with a rapid onset precluding use of 
evidence based practices, defined by delivery on the 
same day as maternal admission to hospital without in 
utero transfer. We also assessed neonatal transport in 
the first 48 hours after delivery; this variable was not 
included in multivariable models, but used for sensitiv-
ity analyses to identify infants who were born in the 
maternity unit associated with the neonatal unit where 
they received care (termed inborn). For the propensity 
score analysis we identified other possible confounders 
(see below).
Missing data
Most variables had low proportions of missing data: 
less than 1% (gestational age, birth weight, sex, multi-
ple pregnancy, neonatal transport, antenatal cortico-
steroids), 1-3% (pregnancy complications, mode of 
delivery, neonatal morbidity), and 4-5% (Apgar score 
and admission to delivery time). In contrast, admission 
temperature was missing in 12.1% of cases (n=886). We 
used multiple imputations chained equations to impute 
missing data, based on all variables in the study.34  We 
used 100 imputed datasets.35 Outcomes were not 
imputed. Results are presented using the imputed data; 
however, models using list-wise deletion are included 
as supplementary tables.
analysis strategy
We described the use of each evidence based practice 
and investigated the factors associated with our all or 
none composite (full evidence based care). We then 
investigated the association of full evidence based care 
with our three primary outcome variables. For both 
analyses, we used generalised linear models to take 
into consideration the clustering of births within hospi-
tals, assuming a Poisson distribution with robust stan-
dard errors to estimate risk ratios.36 Region was 
included as a fixed effect.
To assess the impact of use of evidence based care on 
outcomes, we developed propensity scores to control 
for observed confounding factors. Probabilities of 
receiving full evidence based care were generated using 
logistic regression models, including investigator 
selected covariables and other possible confounders 
(24 variables in total and four interactions, see supple-
mentary table S3). Missing values for these additional 
variables were included as a separate category. After 
consideration of the propensity score using stan-
dardised differences, we assessed the balance in our 
covariables between infants receiving and not receiving 
evidence based care. The propensity score was included 
in our primary analyses by weighting each infant by the 
inverse propensity of his or her group.37 We compared 
results from propensity score models with those from a 
multivariable model, adjusting for investigator selected 
covariables. We ran our models for all infants and 
inborn infants born the day after the mother had been 
admitted to hospital.
To check that our findings did not reflect the influ-
ence of only one of the evidence based practices, we 
reran our models four times, removing each indicator 
in turn. We also assessed the impact of non-receipt of 
one versus two or three, or four practices, compared 
with receiving all interventions, using the multivari-
able model with investigator selected covariables. To

estimate the impact of receipt of evidence based care, 
we predicted cases of death and severe morbidity if 
all infants and almost all infants received the evi-
dence based practices for which they were eligible by 
keeping coefficients and variables values constant 
and setting the evidence based care variable to “yes” 
for all infants, or “yes” for 90% of the infants. The 
10% of infants assigned to continued non-evidence 
based care in the latter model were those with the 
lowest propensity scores, reflecting their likelihood 
of receiving evidence based care based on their 
 
characteristics.
Analyses were carried out using STATA 13.0 SE (Stata, 
College Station, TX).
Results
The mean gestational age in our sample was 28.7 
weeks, with a mean birth weight of 1224 g (table 1); 
25.0% (n=1835) of births were preceded by preterm 
premature rupture of membranes and 42.7% (n=3130) 
were prelabour caesarean sections; 21.9% (n=1605) of 
infants were born on the same day as maternal admis-
sion to hospital without in utero transfer; 11.0% 
(n=808) were transported to another hospital after 
birth. In-hospital  
mortality was 9.2% (n=672), and 
10.3% (n=669/6479) of survivors had a severe neona-
tal morbidity.
Most infants received at least one of the evidence 
based practices (fig 1 ): 88.2% (n=6468) for appropriate 
place of birth, 89.2% (n=6541) for antenatal steroids, 
74.4% (5455) for an admission temperature of 36°C or 
more, and 83.0% (n=6086) for surfactant used within 
two hours or early nasal continuous positive airway 
pressure. However, only 58.3% (n=4275) of infants 
received all four practices and 9.6% (n=704) did not 
receive at least two of the practices. The probability of 
receiving full evidence based care was lower for infants 
of less than 26 weeks gestational age, singletons, small 
for gestational age infants, infants with low Apgar 
scores (<7 at five minutes), infants transported after 
birth, and infants born on the day of maternal admis-
sion (table 2). Full evidence based care by region ranged 
from 32.0% to 75.5%, and differences remained

models, mortality for infants receiving all evidence 
based practices was 28% lower (risk ratio 0.72, 95% 
confidence interval 0.60 to 0.87) and mortality or 
severe morbidity was 18% lower (0.82, 0.73 to 0.92). 
Results were similar in models adjusting for investiga-
tor selected covariables and when the analysis was 
restricted to inborn infants delivered the day after the 
mother had been admitted to hospital.  
Sensitivity anal-
yses with different  
combinations of the evidence based 
practices confirmed that one indicator was not driving 
these associations, and using list-wise deletion of miss-
ing data yielded similar results (see supplementary 
table S4 and fig S1).
We also analysed whether there was a dose-re-
sponse effect, whereby infants receiving fewer evi-
dence based practices had worse outcomes. In 
adjusted models, compared with infants receiving all 
evidence based practices, receiving one fewer prac-
tice was associated with a risk ratio of mortality of 1.32 
(1.09 to 1.60), two fewer of 1.55 (1.23 to 1.95), and three 
or four fewer of 1.81 (1.26 to 2.61). These estimates for 
death or severe neonatal morbidity, or both were 1.20 
(1.10 to 1.34), 1.32 (1.12 to 1.44, and 1.59 (1.30 to 1.94), 
respectively. Most infants not receiving evidence 
based care, however, received only one fewer practice 
(77.0%).
Table 4 illustrates the potential impact of providing 
evidence based care more broadly. We simulated two 
different situations for eligible infants: one where evi-
dence based care was provided to all infants, and one 
where such care was provided to 90%. The model 
with evidence based care provided to all infants pre-
dicted a reduction of 28.1% of the 432 deaths in the 
group that did not receive evidence based care, which 
represents a reduction of 17.9% of all deaths. Of the 
781 cases of death or severe morbidity, or both in the 
non-evidence based group, the reduction was esti-
mated at 19.4%, corresponding to 11.3% of the total

1341 cases. In the scenario where 90% of infants 
received full evidence based care, 18.3% of deaths in 
the non-evidence based group would be prevented, 
representing 11.8% of all deaths. The percentages for 
mortality or severe morbidity were 12.1% and 7.0%, 
respectively.
discussion
Only 58.3% of very preterm infants received all of four 
high evidence practices for which they were eligible, 
including delivery in a maternity unit with appropriate 
level of neonatal care, administration of antenatal cor-
ticosteroids, prevention of hypothermia, and surfactant 
used within two hours of birth or early nasal continu-
ous positive airway pressure. In-hospital mortality as 
well as a combined outcome of mortality or severe neo-
natal morbidity, or both were lower for infants who 
received all components of evidence based care in our 
all or none measure. These results suggest that more 
comprehensive use of these high evidence and widely 
accessible practices could yield substantial gains in 
survival without severe morbidity for these infants at 
high risk.
strengths and limitations of this study
The strengths of our study are its large and heteroge-
neous multiregional population based sample, includ-
ing public and private healthcare facilities, which 
ensure the generalisability of our results to a wide range 
of settings. The EPICE study also developed common 
study instruments and protocols to obtain comparable 
high quality data across regions. Our study also has lim-
itations. It was challenging to define evidence based 
practices that were adapted to diverse cultural and 
organisational settings and could be identified from 
data systematically available in medical records; we 
thus selected the most liberal criteria to ensure high 
acceptability of our thresholds in all contexts. Others 
may prefer more stringent thresholds—for example, 
higher temperatures on admission, or administration of 
full courses of antenatal steroids. Although choosing 
conservative cut-off points overestimates the use of evi-
dence based care, it does not invalidate our main find-
ing of low use of these practices and the gains 
associated with the improvement in evidence based 
perinatal management. We excluded deaths on the 
labour ward because these were more likely to result 
from emergency situations where there was no opportu-
nity to arrange a maternal transfer or to administer 
antenatal steroids and also because of concerns with 
reverse causality. However, suboptimal use of evidence 
based care probably contributes to the risks of death on 
the labour ward, leading us to underestimate total 
effects; future studies with data on exact timing of 
maternal arrival at the hospital, resuscitation practices 
in the delivery room, and parental opinions are needed 
to explore this issue further. We had some missing data 
on interventions and, in particular, on admission tem-
perature. These cases may reflect less focus on hypo-
thermia prevention and have led to an overestimation 
of evidence based care and an underestimation of the 
impact on outcomes. Finally, our study only included 
short term neonatal outcomes; the longer term impacts 
on child neurodevelopment and other measures of 
child and family wellbeing are an important area for 
further investigation.
Comparison with other studies
An all or none approach makes it possible to evaluate 
the process of care and the potential for improvement 
for high evidence based interventions that are 
already widely used. We identified four interventions 
for the care of very preterm infants, which are sup-
ported by evidence, linked to better health outcomes, 
and could be measured in our study in a standardised 
way. Two of these refer to the management of preg-
nant women with threatened preterm delivery and 
two to the early management of infants. This selec-
tion reflects our conviction that optimal outcomes for 
very preterm infants require both prenatal and post-
natal interventions.
Our all or none composite comprises practices that 
have been shown in meta-analyses of randomised con-
trolled trials or observational studies to improve out-
come and have been accepted as standard care for 
over a decade. For the first practice—delivery in an 
appropriate maternity unit—meta-analyses of observa-
tional studies have shown that birth in a maternity 
unit with on-site neonatal intensive care (often termed 
a level 3 unit) is associated with better outcomes for 
very preterm infants.25  As the specialisation of units 
by level of care differs in Europe,38  we used regional 
guidelines to identify appropriate units. For the sec-
ond practice—administration of antenatal corticoste-
roids—meta-analyses have shown reductions in 
neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, intra-
ventricular haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, 
and systemic infections.26  Our third practice focused 
on hypothermia at admission to the neonatal unit, 
which is associated with higher mortality and morbid-
ity.28 39  Plastic wraps or bags, plastic caps, skin-to 
skin-contact, and transwarmer mattresses have all 
been shown to be effective for the prevention of hypo-
thermia.40  As the combination of these measures can 
vary between units, we considered a non-hypothermic 
temperature at neonatal admission to indicate use of 
effective evidence based practices. Multiple defini-
tions of hypothermia are used (<36.0°C or 36.5C°)27 28 ; 
to ensure consensus on our thresholds, we used the 
more liberal definition of 36.0°C. Our last practice 
focused on respiratory management for extremely 
preterm infants, and it is based on two recent 
meta-analyses. One showed less chronic lung disease 
or death when using early stabilisation on nasal con-
tinuous positive airway pressure, with selective sur-
factant administered to infants requiring intubation.30 
 
The other showed less acute and chronic pulmonary 
injury and neonatal mortality from surfactant admin-
istered within the first two hours of life in infants intu-
bated for respiratory distress.29  Given these results, we 
judged either early administration of surfactant or 
early nasal continuous positive airway pressure in

infants born less than 28 weeks of gestation to be evi-
dence based interventions. This combined criterion is 
in accordance with European consensus statements.41 
42
We found high rates for use of each practice—
between 75% and 90%, corroborating network and sin-
gle country studies.43 44  The population receiving full 
evidence based care was, however, much lower: fewer 
than 60% of infants, revealing more severe deficits in 
the care process. We further illustrated the high impact 
on population health of implementing all these prac-
tices by simulating situations in which all and almost 
all infants received the evidence based practices for 
which they were eligible. While we observed a dose-re-
sponse association related to the number of practices 
not administered, most infants received only one fewer 
than the total. These findings underscore the limits of 
evaluating practices in isolation and support the grow-
ing focus in other clinical areas of medicine and other 
specialties, including adult care, on bundling effective 
practices to improve processes of care and to achieve 
best outcomes.45 
46
While it seems surprising that such a low propor-
tion of infants received these key elements of care, 
our results corroborate research from many disci-
plines showing the difficulty of translating effective 
interventions into routine clinical practice. Barriers 
include the doctors’ education, knowledge, and atti-
tudes,20  and organisational obstacles within the unit, 
such as lack of strong leadership, absence of written 
protocols, absence of in-service training, no manage-
ment support, and the size of the facility.47 48  Differ-
ences in ethical attitudes influencing active 
management of extremely preterm infants may be 
another contributing factor,21  although the exclusion 
of births under 24 weeks and labour ward deaths 
probably minimised this effect. Many countries rec-
ommend active management starting at 24 weeks of 
gestation, but in others this remains a grey area in 
which decisions on active  
management are discussed 
with parents.49  Finally, the regulatory context may be 
one driver of implementation for these interventions, 
although the relation between the existence of guide-
lines and practice is complex.18 20  All these factors 
likely contribute to the variability in evidence based 
care observed between the European regions included 
in this study, corroborating previous reports of wide 
practice variability for the care of very preterm infants 
across countries and across hospitals within 
 
countries.8 10-12 50
Our results also showed that the organisational 
challenges of managing unexpected deliveries con-
tributed to low use of evidence based care for very 
preterm infants, although this did not explain the 
shortfall in use of evidence based care that existed 
even for inborn babies whose mothers were admitted 
to hospital for at least one day before their birth. Fur-
ther investigation is needed to assess whether actions 
targeting the organisation and provision of care in sit-
uations involving unexpected or precipitous deliveries 
could achieve rates of the all or none composite close 
to 100%.
Conclusion and policy implications
Only 58.3% of very preterm infants admitted for perina-
tal care in 19 European regions received all of the four 
evidence based practices for which they were eligible; 
receipt of evidence based care was associated with 
improved survival after taking into consideration clini-
cal and delivery factors that may affect access to care 
and outcomes. Maximising the number of very preterm 
infants who receive the complete set of these well 
proved practices could yield substantial gains in sur-
vival without increasing severe neonatal morbidity in 
survivors.
