High milk consumption might shorten life span through increased oxidative stress. We aimed to determine
whether higher mortality rates with high milk consumption are modified by fruit and vegetable intake or total anti-
oxidant intake (oxygen radical absorbance capacity). We used information from food frequency questionnaires
completed by 61,420 women in a Swedish cohort (22,391 deaths from the 1987–1990 baseline onward), 36,714
women from a second survey (1997) of this cohort, and 45,280 Swedish men (15,478 deaths from the 1998 base-
line onward). Compared with low consumption of milk (<1 glass/day) and high consumption of fruits/vegeta-
bles (≥5 servings/day), time-updated information revealed an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 2.79 (95%
confidence interval (CI): 2.42, 3.21) in women who consumed ≥3 glasses of milk/day and <1 serving/day of fruit/
vegetables and a hazard ratio of 1.60 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.82) in women who consumed the same amount of milk but
≥5 servings/day of fruits/vegetables. The same comparisons in men, based on a single food frequency question-
naire, displayed hazard ratios of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.51) and 1.07 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.18), respectively. Total anti-
oxidant consumption showed similar patterns as fruit/vegetable intakes. Dietary antioxidant intake, especially in
women, seems to modify the elevated death rate associated with high milk consumption.

High milk consumption has long been promoted as
strengthening bone and reducing the likelihood of fragility
fractures. However, we recently demonstrated a higher risk of
fracture with high daily milk consumption in women (1).
Mortality rates were also increased in both women and men
with high milk consumption. We hypothesized that the under-
lying mechanism could be explained by the lactose content of
milk (1).
Milk is the main dietary source of D-galactose, one compo-
nent of the disaccharide lactose. Chronic D-galactose exposure
in animals, with a dose corresponding to 1–2 glasses of milk
in humans (1, 2), is deleterious to health by means of oxida-
tive stress damage and chronic inflammation (2–5). Female
animals seem to be especially vulnerable (6–8). The increased
oxidative stress with aging and chronic low-grade inflamma-
tion is not only a pathogenic mechanism of cardiovascular
disease and cancer in humans (9, 10) but also a mechanism of
age-related bone loss and sarcopenia (10, 11).
Oxidative stress and inflammation can be reduced by a diet
rich in antioxidants (12–15), and such foods could potentially
reduce rates of death (16, 17). Because of the antioxidant cap-
acity of vegetables and fruits and the high content of lactose/
galactose in milk, which may induce oxidative stress and
low-grade inflammation, we hypothesized that a high intake
of fruits and vegetables or a high total antioxidant intake
(18, 19) may counteract the observed associations of milk in-
take with mortality. Indeed, experimental evidence in animals
indicates that galactose-induced aging can be prevented by a
higher intake of fruits and vegetables (20–24).
To our knowledge, no previous clinical study has com-
bined milk consumption with fruit and vegetable intake and
total antioxidant intake to evaluate associations with the rate

 of death. In Scandinavia, consumption of milk and of fruits
and vegetables displays a wide range in intake (1, 25, 26).
Therefore, our main objective in this Swedish cohort study
was to determine whether fruit and vegetable intake or total
antioxidant intake modifies the previously observed rela-
tionship between milk consumption and death.
METHODS
We used data from 2 previously described (1) population-
based cohort studies, the Swedish Mammography Cohort
(SMC) and the Cohort of Swedish Men. The SMC started in
1987–1990 when 74% of all 90,303 women aged 39–74
years residing in 2 Swedish counties completed a question-
naire covering diet (food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)) and
lifestyle that had been enclosed with a mailed invitation to
undergo routine mammography screening. In 1997, a subse-
quent expanded questionnaire was sent to the 56,030 women
still living in the study area (response rate 70%). We excluded
women with implausible values for total energy intake (≥3
standard deviations below or above the log-transformed mean
energy intake; cutoffs were 574 kcal/day and 4,707 kcal/day)
(27) and those with missing data on all items regarding fruit
and vegetable consumption. Exclusion of outliers for energy
intake, in addition to adjustment for total energy intake in the
statistical analyses, compensates for overall under- or overre-
porting of dietary intake (28). In the present study, a first anal-
ysis included 61,240 women without a prevalent cancer
diagnosis in the SMC with information from 1987–1990 and
38,331 women with updated information from 1997. In a sec-
ond analysis with baseline set at the second examination, we
included 36,714 women who were alive on January 1, 1998,
and free of any previous cancers.
The Cohort of Swedish Men was established in 1997.
All men aged 45–79 years residing in 2 counties in central
Sweden were invited to participate in the study (n = 100,303).
The FFQ and lifestyle questionnaire was completed by
48,850 men. Despite a response rate of only 49%, the Co-
hort of Swedish Men is representative of Swedish men in
this age range in relation to age distribution, educational level,
and prevalence of overweight (29). We excluded men with
implausible values for total energy intake (cutoffs were
861 kcal/day and 7,311 kcal/day). For the present analysis,
45,280 men who were alive on January 1, 1998, and free of
previous cancers were available.
The single FFQ administered in 1997 was used to simplify
the comparison between men and women, but in women we
also used time-updated information by means of the complete
SMC data set. The studies have been approved by the Regional
Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden.
Exposures
The participants reported, by means of a valid and reprodu-
cible FFQ, their average frequency of consumption of up to 96
foods and beverages during the past year, including milk (ei-
ther low-fat (≤0.5%), medium-fat (1.5%), or high-fat (3%)),
sour milk, yogurt, cheese, 5 fruits (apples, bananas, berries,
oranges/citrus fruit, and other fruit), orange juice, and 13
vegetables (carrots, beet root, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower,
lettuce, onion, garlic, peas, pea soup, peppers, spinach, toma-
toes, and other vegetables) (29–31). There were 8 possible fre-
quency categories in increasing order from zero times per
month to more than 3 times per day. In the 1987–1990 FFQ,
the numbers of fruit (n = 4) and vegetable (n = 5) categories
were fewer, but they comprised more fruit or vegetable items
in each category. The fruit and vegetable categories repre-
sented the typical consumption pattern in Sweden at the time
of each investigation, with a higher number of items over
time. In accordance with national dietary guidelines (32), only
1 glass of juice (fresh or from concentrate) was included in
the calculation of daily intake, independent of the amount in-
gested. Instructions in the FFQ stated that 1 serving of milk
corresponds to 1 glass of 200 mL. Milk intake was specified
according to fat content, and intakes were summed into a sin-
gle measure representing total milk intake on a continuous
scale. Missing values for individual dairy products were inter-
preted as no intake of that particular food (33). The small frac-
tion of missing data for single items, which were regarded as
zero consumption, is unlikely to represent a bias for the ob-
served findings (33). In fact, 92% of those who did not report
milk consumption on the FFQ part of the questionnaire re-
ported that they did not consume milk when posed a specific
question, and 99.8% had consumption of less than 1 glass/day
according to complementary open questions regarding dairy
consumption.
Nutrient intakes were estimated by multiplying the con-
sumption frequency of each food item by the nutrient con-
tent of age-specific portion sizes and reference data obtained
from the Swedish National Food Agency database (34) and
were adjusted for total energy intake using the residual
method (28). According to validation studies of the self-
reported milk intakes, the Spearman coefficient for correl-
ation between the FFQ and four 7-day food records every
third month (a gold standard reference) was approximately
0.7 (35). Spearman coefficients for correlation between the
FFQ and the averages of these four 7-day dietary records
ranged between 0.4 and 0.7 for individual fruit and vege-
table items.
We calculated estimates of total antioxidant capacity from
diet analyzed with an oxygen radical absorbance capacity
(ORAC) assay, as described in detail previously (18). The
FFQ contained 31 items with available ORAC values. The to-
tal antioxidant capacity of the diet (µmol/day) was calculated
as the sum of the antioxidant content of the 31 food items,
calculated by multiplying the average daily consumption of
each food by its ORAC concentration (μmol Trolox equiva-
lents (TE)/100 g) (Trolox: F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Basel,
Switzerland). Because antioxidants in coffee and tea have
been shown to be poorly absorbed, we took into account ab-
sorption (6% for coffee and 4% for tea) when calculating the
ORAC (36). The correlation between the total antioxidant
capacities of dietary ORAC and plasma ORAC was 0.31.
Outcomes
We considered as the primary outcome all-cause mortal-
ity registered between baseline and September 30, 2015, in
the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. We used the under-
lying cause of death from the Swedish Cause of Death

 Registry to define secondary outcomes: mortality from cardio-
vascular diseases (International Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision, codes I00–I99) and cancer (International
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, C-codes) through
December 31, 2014. For 1987–1996, we used corresponding
codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision.
Statistical analysis
We calculated time at risk for each participant from study
entry until the date of each outcome, the date of emigration,
or the end of the study period, whichever came first. We first
evaluated trends in mortality rates according to milk intake,
fruit and vegetable intake, and ORAC using restricted cubic-
spline Cox regression with 3 knots placed at percentiles 10,
50, and 90 of the exposures (37). We calculated age-adjusted
death rates and age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios
and 95% confidence intervals for categories of milk intake
(<1, 1–<2, 2–<3, or ≥3 glasses/day) and categories of fruit
and vegetable intake or quartiles of ORAC. We categorized
fruit and vegetable intake as <1, 1–<2, 2–<3, 3–<4, 4–<5,
or ≥5 servings/day, with the latter category reflecting dietary
recommendations (32). The proportional hazards assumptions
were confirmed graphically by log-log plots.
To select suitable covariates for the multivariable model,
we used present knowledge and directed acyclic graphs
(38). The model for the total effect included age, total en-
ergy intake, body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2),
height, intakes of yogurt, cheese, red and processed meat,
and alcohol (all continuous), educational level (≤9 years,
10–12 years, >12 years, or other), living alone (yes/no),
ever use of antioxidant supplements (yes/no), physical activ-
ity (metabolic equivalent-hours/day; continuous), smoking
status (never, former with <20 pack-years, former with ≥20
pack-years, current with <20 pack-years, or current with
≥20 pack-years) and Charlson’s comorbidity index (pos-
sible range of scores, 0–33; continuous) (39, 40). To avoid
loss of efficiency and limit the introduction of bias by re-
stricting the analysis to persons with complete data alone,
missing data on covariates were imputed using multiple im-
putation (41). We also imputed covariates not assessed at
the baseline of the SMC in 1987–1990 (e.g., smoking status
and physical activity) (1). Additional sensitivity analyses in-
cluded exclusion of the first 2 years of follow-up, persons
with a body mass index greater than 35, and current smok-
ers. To our second model, we also added as covariates use
of calcium-containing supplements and, for baseline 1997,
use of aspirin and prevalent hypercholesterolemia. In a
fourth model, we additionally adjusted our estimates for
energy-adjusted dietary intakes of protein, total and satu-
rated fat, calcium, vitamin D, retinol, and phosphorus; ever
use of cortisone; and, among women, hormone replacement
therapy.
Measures of interaction were calculated on the basis of
adjusted hazard ratios (HRs), using persons consuming
less than 1 glass of milk and 5 or more servings of fruit
and vegetables per day as the reference category for the
following groups (annotations in parentheses): milk intake

1990) (solid line), in the SMC after administration of the second food fre-
quency questionnaire (baseline 1997) (short-dashed line), and in the
Cohort of Swedish Men (baseline 1998) (long-dashed line). The shaded
areas illustrate 95% confidence intervals. One glass of milk corre-
sponds to 200 mL. Covariates were age, body mass index (weight (kg)/
height (m)2), height, energy intake, alcohol intake, intakes of yogurt,
cheese, and red and processed meat, education, marital status (living
alone vs. not), physical activity (metabolic equivalent-hours/day), smok-
ing habits (never, former, or current smoker and, for baseline 1997, also
pack-years of smoking), ever use of antioxidant-containing supple-
ments, and weighted Charlson’s comorbidity index. Associations with
milk intake were further adjusted for intake of fruit and vegetables, and
associations with fruit and vegetable intake and ORAC were adjusted
for intake of milk.

 ≥3 glasses/day, fruit and vegetable intake ≥5 servings/day
(HR10); milk intake <1 glass/day, fruit and vegetable intake
<1 serving/day (HR01); and milk intake ≥3 glasses/day,
fruit and vegetable intake <1 serving/day (HR11). The rela-
tive excess risk of interaction (interaction on the additive
scale) was calculated as HR11 − HR10 − HR01 + 1 (42), and
95% confidence intervals were obtained by means of the
bootstrap percentile method with 1,000 bootstrap samples.
The statistical analyses were performed with Stata 13.1
(StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Characteristics of the study population by baseline date and
sex are presented in Tables 1–3. Approximately 9% of the
women reported milk consumption of ≥3 glasses/day in 1987–
1990 (Table 1), whereas in 1997 only 2% reported such intake
(Table 2). Men had on average higher consumption of milk;
15% drank ≥3 glasses/day in 1997 (Table 3). Average re-
ported consumption of fruits and vegetables among women
was 3.5 servings/day (standard deviation (SD), 2.0) at baseline
and 5.3 servings/day (SD, 3.0) at the follow-up examination.
Men reported an average consumption of 4.1 servings/day
(SD, 2.5). Intake of fruits and vegetables did not vary by milk
intake in either women or men.
During a mean follow-up period of 23 years (maximum 29
years), 22,391 women (total time at risk = 1,434,171 person-
years) died. From January 1, 1998, onward, 10,314 women
(581,785 person-years) and 15,478 men (687,688 person-years)
died during a mean follow-up period of 15 years (maximum 17
years). Death rates increased in both sexes with increasing milk
consumption (Figure 1A), and death rates decreased with high-
er consumption of fruit and vegetables (Figure 1B), as well as
with higher ORACs (Figure 1C), although a threshold seemed
to be discerned (>5 servings of fruit/vegetables per day and
15,000 µmol ORAC/day). In men, higher death rates started to
be observed after only 3 or more glasses of milk per day
(Figure 1A). In women, death rates were already increased at
1–2 glasses of milk per day.
In further analyses, we combined milk intake with fruit and
vegetable consumption, as well as with ORACs. In Table 4,
we present age-adjusted rates and numbers of deaths by each
combination category. The rate of mortality was highest
among persons consuming less than 1 serving of fruit and vege-
tables per day (or in the lowest quartile of ORAC) combined
with a high consumption of milk, in both men and women. In
contrast, the lowest age-adjusted mortality rates were found in
women and men who reported high consumption of fruits and
vegetables or had high ORACs combined with low intake of
milk.
Figures 2 and 3 depict the multivariable-adjusted hazard ra-
tios for mortality by milk and fruit/vegetable intake or ORAC,
using the group with the lowest intake of milk (<1 glass/day)
and the highest intake of fruit and vegetables (≥5 servings/
day) or ORAC (highest quartile) as the reference. Hazard ra-
tios for mortality tended to increase with higher milk con-
sumption in every category of fruit and vegetable intake or
ORAC, although the estimates were attenuated with increasing

 consumption of fruits and vegetables or ORAC. The pattern
was clearer with time-updated information as compared with a
single exposure assessment. Accordingly, in time-updated
analysis of the SMC, a high intake of milk (≥3 glasses/day)
with a concomitant low intake of fruit and vegetables (<1
serving/day) conferred a multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of
2.79 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.42, 3.21), and with a
combined high intake of fruit and vegetables, the hazard ratio
was 1.60 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.82). In women with a single expo-
sure assessment, the corresponding estimates were 1.81 (95%
CI: 1.03, 3.20) and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.38), respectively.
The same comparisons in men revealed a hazard ratio of 1.31
(95% CI: 1.14, 1.51) for high consumers of milk with a low
fruit and vegetable intake and a hazard ratio of 1.07 (95% CI:
0.97, 1.18) for high consumers of milk who also consumed 5
or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day. If we used
ORAC intake instead of fruit and vegetable intake as the
effect-measure modifier, the estimates remained essentially
unaltered. The relative excess risk of interaction estimate
of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.01, 1.27) in the time-updated analysis of
women indicated a modest additive interaction. No significant
interaction was discovered among men (data not shown).
Hazard ratios were not attenuated in women after addi-
tional adjustment, including adjustment for vitamin and min-
eral nutrients common in milk, although they were somewhat
attenuated in men (see Web Table 1, available at http://aje.
oxfordjournals.org/). The total number of cardiovascular dis-
ease or cancer deaths was less than half that of the number of
deaths from any cause (Web Tables 2 and 3). Nevertheless,
for cardiovascular mortality (Web Table 4), the hazard ratios
remained similar to estimates of all-cause mortality, whereas
hazard ratios for cancer mortality were lower (Web Table 5).
Exclusion of the first 2 years of follow-up (Web Table 6;
2%–5% of all deaths were excluded, depending on the anal-
ysis), persons with a body mass index greater than 35 (Web
Table 7; 2% of all deaths were excluded), and current smok-
ers (Web Table 8; 24%–29% of all deaths were excluded)
gave estimates similar to those seen in the total cohort.
DISCUSSION
In 2 independent population-based cohorts, mortality rates
were highest in persons with high consumption of milk com-
bined with low consumption of fruits and vegetables or a low
ORAC. However, the gradient of risk with increasing milk
consumption was more pronounced in women, and an additive
interaction for mortality rates between milk consumption and
fruit and vegetable consumption was found only in women.
The findings of our observational investigation should not
be evaluated in isolation and have to be interpreted cautiously.
A recent attempt to perform a meta-analysis demonstrated sub-
stantial heterogeneity in nonfermented milk consumption
among cohort studies in relation to mortality from all causes
(43). Heterogeneity among studies was observed in most sub-
groups defined by sex, country, and study quality (43). Besides
methodological differences, a potential explanation for the in-
consistent findings may be related to the variability in the range
of milk consumption in different populations and, as also indi-
cated by our present study, by different patterns of intake of
antioxidant-rich foods in the populations. To our knowledge,
no randomized trial has examined the association of milk in-
take with incidence of mortality, and this study design is un-
likely to ever be implemented. Another possible analytical
approach might be the use of genetic variation in lactase per-
sistence within a Mendelian randomization study design, but
this specific genetic variant is probably weak as an instrumen-
tal variable (44), with conceivable pleiotropic effects (45, 46).
The present study extends our previous finding of higher
mortality rates with high milk consumption (1). Our postu-
lated mechanism is that milk consumption induces oxidative
stress by way of the galactose component of lactose,

 because galactose supplementation results in premature
aging in animals through induction of oxidative stress and
inflammation (2–5). Oxidative stress induced by galactose is
a consequence of an imbalance between prooxidant and
antioxidant defenses, which causes accumulation of ad-
vanced glycation end-products and reactive oxygen species,
especially superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide (2–5).
Indeed, we have previously noted higher concentrations of
oxidative stress and inflammation markers in human urine
and serum with high consumption of milk (1).
Mortality rates were increased at more moderate levels of
milk consumption in women as compared with men; excess
mortality was seen with 1–2 glasses of milk per day in women,
while twice that amount was necessary for the observation of
excess mortality in men. A sex difference in sensitivity to
galactose exposure has been identified experimentally (6–8),
and galactose elimination capacity is also higher in men than
in women, but it declines with increasing age (47–49).
Galactose is used in the endogenous production of human
breast milk. Most lactose in human breast milk is synthe-
sized from galactose taken up from the blood, and only
one-third is made from endogenous synthesis (50). Liver
glycogen in infants is formed mainly from breast milk–de-
rived galactose (51), and it acts as a reservoir for subsequent
hepatic glucose release to the circulation during times of
fasting (52, 53). A lower female degradation of galactose
might have been an evolutionary survival mechanism for
the child. Specifically, the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate
uridylyltransferase (GALT) in the Leloir breakdown pathway
of galactose (Figure 4) has a higher activity in male animals
than in female animals (7, 54, 55). GALT deficiency is also
the main cause of galactosemia, an inborn error of metabol-
ism resulting in early death without avoidance of galactose
intake. With lower capacity of galactose degradation to glu-
cose by the Leloir pathway, an alternative route is the polyol
pathway, where galactose is converted to galactitol by al-
dose reductase, secondarily leading to free-radical formation
(56, 57). In addition, galactose reacts nonenzymatically with
amino groups in proteins and peptides, forming advanced
glycation end-products (3). Although the exact mechanisms
are not known, galactose-treated rodents, flies, and tissue
culture cells also display evidence of lower-than-expected
antioxidant enzyme activities, suggesting that the normal
defenses might be compromised (2, 5, 58).
By reducing oxidative stress and inflammation processes,
higher fruit and vegetable intake has convincingly been
shown to promote longevity (17, 59) and reduce the risk of
cardiovascular disease (13, 17, 60) and some cancers (61).
Intriguingly, and supporting our results in women, there is
experimental evidence that fruits and vegetables or extracts
of them can rescue animals from the premature aging pheno-
type induced by galactose supplementation (20–24, 62, 63).
We found no clear interaction between milk intake and
fruit and vegetable intake in men. This failure to find an
interaction could have several explanations. The association
between milk and mortality was more modest in men, and a
clear excess mortality rate was observed in men only above
≥3 glasses/day, which limited our possibility to detect an

Overview of galactose metabolism. The major pathway of galactose metabolism (the Leloir pathway) operates via the enzymes galac-
tokinase (GALK), galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT), and uridine diphosphate (UDP) galactose 4-epimerase (GALE), resulting in
UDP-glucose. The conversion to galactitol by aldose reductase via the polyol pathway results in decreased availability of nicotinamide adenine di-
nucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione, with increased production of free radicals (56). By way of a nonenzymatic reaction with amino
groups in proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, galactose is converted to advanced glycation end products (AGEs).

 interaction pattern with fruit and vegetables. Furthermore,
the gene expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes
(such as mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase and super-
oxide dismutase) in animals seem to be higher in females
than in males, giving females an enhanced capacity to pro-
vide mitigation of oxidative damage through an increased
intake of antioxidants (64).
The main strengths of this study were the use of data
from 2 large population-based cohorts and the comprehen-
sive FFQ administered in a setting with a wide range of
milk intakes and intakes of antioxidant foods. We found
consistency in the results irrespective of whether fruit and
vegetable consumption or ORAC was used as the effect
measure modifier. Loss to follow-up was negligible, be-
cause we used the individual personal identification number
for linkage to the death registry. Through the use of time-
updated information and with a larger number of outcomes
in the SMC, we observed stronger estimates compared with
use of a single assessment of exposure. Questions regarding
fruit and vegetable intake were more diversified in the sec-
ond FFQ, administered in 1997, but still the mortality rate
patterns with a threshold at 5 servings/day were similar
(Figure 1B). Our results might not apply to people of other
ethnic origins, such as those with a high prevalence of lac-
tose intolerance, or to children and adolescents.
Our observational results in this population of Swedish
adults question the value of recommending high consump-
tion of milk, especially in women not meeting the recom-
mended requirements for fruit and vegetable intake (≥5
servings/day).
