Introduction: Adolescence and young adulthood are periods of continued biological
and psychosocial maturation. Thus, there may be deleterious effects of consuming large
quantities of alcohol on neural development and associated cognition during this time.
The purpose of this mini review is to highlight neuroimaging research that has specifically
examined the effects of binge and heavy drinking on adolescent and young adult brain
structure and function.
Methods: We review cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of young binge and heavy
drinkers that have examined brain structure (e.g., gray and white matter volume, cortical
thickness, white matter microstructure) and investigated brain response using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Results: Binge and heavy-drinking adolescents and young adults have systematically
thinner and lower volume in prefrontal cortex and cerebellar regions, and attenuated white
matter development. They also show elevated brain activity in fronto-parietal regions
during working memory, verbal learning, and inhibitory control tasks. In response to
alcohol cues, relative to controls or light-drinking individuals, binge and heavy drinkers
show increased neural response mainly in mesocorticolimbic regions, including the
striatum, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus, and amygdala. Mixed findings
are present in risky decision-making tasks, which could be due to large variation in task
design and analysis.
Conclusions: These findings suggest altered neural structure and activity in binge and
heavy-drinking youth may be related to the neurotoxic effects of consuming alcohol in
large quantities during a highly plastic neurodevelopmental period, which could result in
neural reorganization, and increased risk for developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD).
Keywords: binge drinking, heavy drinking, adolescence, young adulthood, MRI and fMRI
INTRODUCTION
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have highlighted ongoing brain maturation through
young adulthood (Gogtay et al., 2004). Decreases in cortical gray matter (GM) from ages 10–12
through adulthood have been attributed to synaptic pruning, a process that prioritizes efficiency
and strengthening of connections via proliferation of myelin over the creation of new synaptic

connections that occurs in childhood (Amlien et al., 2016).
White
matter
(WM)
volume
increases
linearly
through
young adulthood, which yields relatively stable total brain
volumes after puberty (Giedd et al., 2009). This period of
significant cortical modification coincides with increases in
behavioral risk taking including the use of alcohol and other
substances.
Alcohol use has negative effects on cognition and the
brain (Jacobus and Tapert, 2013) and on health and safety
(Nhtsa, 2014), yet drinking in high quantities increases during
adolescence as nearly 25% of high school seniors report
getting drunk in the last 30 days (Johnston et al., 2017).
Binge or heavy episodic drinking (i.e., 4 or more standard
drinks within a 2 h drinking session for females, 5 or
more drinks for males) (NIAAA, 2004)1 leads to increased
risk for negative acute effects, such as drunk driving, unsafe
sex, and other substance use (Miller et al., 2007). Long-
term, adolescent alcohol use is related to serious psychosocial
problems, including comorbid psychopathology (Deas and
Thomas, 2002), poorer academic success (Kristjansson et al.,
2013), and detrimental neurocognitive consequences (Jacobus
and Tapert, 2013). Furthermore, binge drinking patterns initiated
during late adolescence often persist into early adulthood
(Degenhardt et al., 2013) and initiating heavy drinking at an
early age significantly increases risk for subsequent adult alcohol
use disorders (AUD) and related problems (Hingson et al.,
2006).
Given the increase of binge and heavy drinking during
adolescence when protracted brain maturation is still underway,
understanding the potentially harmful effects of consuming large
quantities of alcohol on neural development and associated
cognition is of central importance. The purpose of this
mini review is to highlight associations that may reflect
deleterious effects of binge drinking and also to inform future
investigations into the effects of binge drinking on brain
development and functioning in young binge/heavy episodic
drinkers (BD/HD). Thus, we excluded samples based on
diagnostic criteria (e.g., alcohol abuse or AUD), treatment
studies, and those that characterized drinking based on
non-binge or heavy-drinking criteria (e.g., lifetime alcohol
use days).

grams of pure alcohol).
changes in brain structure associated with binge drinking
(Table 1).
GM and WM Macrostructure
Several cross-sectional studies have examined brain structure
and binge and heavy-drinking histories of varying lengths in
young drinkers, and the majority have highlighted regions of
interest where alcohol-related deficits have been identified in
chronic alcoholics (Pfefferbaum et al., 1998). Many studies report
smaller volumes or thinner tissue distributed across neocortical
regions primarily in frontal cortices, but also in temporal and
parietal cortices (see Table 1). For example, a study that followed
drinking patterns of young adults for 10 years reported HD
exhibited reduced GM volume in the anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), temporal gyrus, and insular
cortex compared to light drinkers (LD) (Heikkinen et al., 2017).
One study targeting the ACC also reported decreased cortical
thickness among BD compared to LD (Mashhoon et al., 2014),
while another study found that BD exhibited larger ACC volumes
(Doallo et al., 2014). A large cross-sectional study reported that
BD (n = 134) exhibited smaller volumes and thinner cortical
tissue in total, frontal, and temporal GM as well as thinner
cingulate cortex compared to controls (n = 674). In addition,
within the BD group the number of binges in the previous year
was negatively related to frontal and parietal cortical thickness
(Pfefferbaum et al., 2016).
Subcortical
regions
including
the
hippocampus,
diencephalon, cerebellum and brain stem also exhibit decreased
volume among BD. For example, smaller left hippocampal
volume in conjunction with greater hippocampal asymmetry in
BD compared to controls has been found (Medina et al., 2007).
Other studies reported brain stem volumes were smaller in HD
compared to LD (Squeglia et al., 2014), and binge drinking
episodes were inversely related to cerebellar volume (Lisdahl
et al., 2013). Conversely, one study reported increased volume
in the ventral striatum and thalamus among BD compared to
controls (Howell et al., 2013). Interestingly, two studies found no
differences between BD compared to controls/LD, but discovered
a BD by sex interaction such that male BD exhibited smaller
volumes compared to male controls/LD in several frontal,
temporal, and subcortical regions, while female BD had larger
volumes than female controls/LD in the same regions (Squeglia
et al., 2012b; Kvamme et al., 2016).
Two longitudinal studies were able to examine structural MRI
changes in adolescents who had a pre-drinking baseline measure.
One reported greater-than-expected decline in cortical thickness
in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) associated with the onset of
binge drinking (Luciana et al., 2013), as well as greater increases
in several distributed WM regions over 2 years in non-drinkers
compared to BD (Luciana et al., 2013). In a larger sample similar
accelerated declines in frontal and temporal cortical volumes
in BD and slower increases in WM were reported (Squeglia
et al., 2015). A co-twin study attempted to parse out effects of
drinking from genetic (or other) pre-existing vulnerabilities by
examining co-twin deviations, and reported that reduced volume
of the ventral diencephalon and middle temporal gyrus could
be attributed to drinking, while reduced volume of the right

 Cservenka and Brumback
Youth Binge and Heavy Drinking
amygdala and increased volume of the left cerebellum appeared
to be pre-existing vulnerability for the onset of drinking (Wilson
et al., 2015).
Taken together, binge drinking appears to be largely associated
with decreased volume and accelerated thinning in the frontal
and prefrontal cortices and slowing of expected WM increases.
Allocortical and subcortical regions may reflect some specific
positive associations with binge drinking (e.g., ventral striatum),
and there is some evidence that male and female BD may exhibit
an inverse relationship in some frontal and subcortical regions.
GM and WM Microstructure
Among alcohol dependent adults WM integrity tends to be
weakened (Pfefferbaum et al., 2006), but fewer studies have
examined the effects of binge drinking on WM and GM
microstructure (see Table 1). Each study among non-dependent
BD has reported WM integrity deficits compared to LD/controls
across the majority of WM tracts (Jacobus et al., 2009; Mcqueeny
et al., 2009; Bava et al., 2013). Longitudinal studies also support
decreased WM integrity among individuals who initiate or
increase binge drinking, showing additional declines in fractional
anisotropy over time (Jacobus et al., 2013; Luciana et al., 2013).
A recent study examining both GM and WM microstructure
utilizing orientation dispersion index (ODI) reported that BD
had lower ODI in frontal GM but higher ODI in parietal GM
and in the ventral striatum (Morris et al., 2017). Thus, overall
it appears that binge drinking is associated with decreased
WM microstructural integrity, but may be selectively related to
increases in microstructural GM in a brain region associated with
reward seeking.
FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE
IMAGING (FMRI)
As structural abnormalities have been related to heavy alcohol use
during neuromaturation, it is important to understand whether
these findings translate to alterations in the functioning of
brain systems across different cognitive domains. We discuss six
areas that have included studies of BD/HD: response inhibition,
working memory, verbal learning and memory, decision making
and reward processing, alcohol cue reactivity, and socio-
cognitive/socio-emotional processing (Table 2). Further, in order
to focus this section of the mini review on task-related functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, we excluded
discussion of functional connectivity (Gorka et al., 2013; Weiland
et al., 2014; Morris et al., 2016), acute alcohol administration
(Filbey et al., 2008), machine learning (Squeglia et al., 2017),
treatment (Feldstein Ewing et al., 2016), and neurofeedback
(Kirsch et al., 2016) studies that included young BD/HD, as well
as studies where binge drinking was examined, but was not the
main variable of interest (Glaser et al., 2014).
Response Inhibition
The ability to inhibit a pre-potent response or have self-control
over impulsive actions is a central facet of executive functioning
(Diamond, 2013). Several studies have identified deficits in
response inhibition and its neural correlates in individuals with
AUD (Lawrence et al., 2009), and these investigations have
extended to adolescent and young adult BD/HD, most of which
have used Go/NoGo tasks. For example, in a study of 18–20 year
old college students, HD showed slower reaction times on both
correct Go hits and incorrect NoGo false alarms (Ahmadi et al.,
2013). LD had greater response in ACC, supplementary motor
area (SMA), MFG, parietal lobe, hippocampus, and superior
temporal gyrus (STG) than HD during NoGo correct rejections,
suggesting decreased inhibitory control brain activity in HD in a
set of brain regions that underlie cognitive and impulse control
(Ahmadi et al., 2013).
Variations of the Go/NoGo task have used alcohol-related
images as NoGo stimuli and non-alcoholic beverages as Go
stimuli. Ames et al. (2014) demonstrated that compared with
HD, LD had better Go/NoGo task performance as indexed by
d-prime. HD had greater activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC), ACC, and the anterior insula than LD during
NoGo trials, suggesting greater reliance on executive functioning,
error monitoring, and emotional interoception regions during
inhibitory control (Ames et al., 2014). Another task presented
the traditional letters used in Go/NoGo tasks overlaid onto black,
neutral picture, and alcoholic photo backgrounds. While there
were no effects of background context, college HD displayed
greater activity in visual and emotional processing regions, such
as the amygdala and occipital lobe during failed inhibitions
compared with LD (Campanella et al., 2016).
In one longitudinal investigation, HD had greater fronto-
parietal and cerebellar activity during response inhibition relative
to controls at follow-up but reduced activity in these same
regions at baseline, suggesting both markers of vulnerability
toward heavy drinking and altered executive functioning activity
after the initiation of heavy alcohol use (Wetherill et al., 2013).
Task-related fMRI studies have largely reported that HD/BD
have increased fronto-parietal and cerebellar response during
successful inhibitory control and increased emotional and visual
response during unsuccessful response inhibition (except for
Ahmadi et al., 2013).
Working Memory
Another key component of executive functioning is working
memory (WrkM), the ability to maintain and manipulate
information during a short time span (Diamond, 2013). WrkM
has been linked with adaptive decision making and deficits in
WrkM are associated with vulnerability toward addiction (Nagel
et al., 2012). An fMRI n-back task of WrkM was completed
by university BD, who showed larger pre-SMA WrkM-related
activity than controls, suggesting greater attentional resources
devoted to performing the task by the BD to maintain equal
performance with the control group (Campanella et al., 2013).
Some studies have reported that sex differences may also be
present in WrkM-related activation between male and female
BD. Female BD had less spatial WrkM activation in several
frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions compared to female
controls and this was linked to poor behavioral performance
in the BD, a pattern opposite to what was seen in male BD
relative to male controls (Squeglia et al., 2011). The authors
argue that this may suggest female vulnerability toward the
neurotoxic effects of binge drinking during active periods of
neuromaturation.

 Cservenka and Brumback
Youth Binge and Heavy Drinking
While longitudinal research is sparse among fMRI studies
of BD/HD youth, one study reported reduced baseline fronto-
parietal activity in adolescents who later transitioned into heavy
drinking. However, HD showed significantly increased activity
in these areas at a 3-year follow-up relative to baseline brain
response (Squeglia et al., 2012a). Overall, these studies suggest
mostly greater WrkM-related brain activity across fronto-parietal
regions in BD/HD relative to controls, but some exceptions may
be present when examining sex differences and pre-drinking
vulnerability.
Learning and Memory
Deficits in learning and memory have been previously reported
in individuals with AUD (Pitel et al., 2014), and in investigations
of BD youth (Carbia et al., 2017). In the first of three studies
examining neural response during verbal or figural encoding,
Schweinsburg et al. (2010) found that while learning novel
word pairs, BD showed elevated superior frontal and posterior
parietal activity compared with controls, a finding that was
closely replicated in a subsequent study where BD had greater
fronto-parietal activity during novel encoding, with some areas
displaying reduced activity relative to controls, such as the
inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), precuneus, and ACC (Schweinsburg
et al., 2011). These findings suggest some degree of neural
reorganization in BD that results in increased reliance on fronto-
parietal regions while learning novel word pairs, and decreased
activity in other regions.
Pictorial as opposed to verbal stimuli were used in a study of
college HD who demonstrated similar patterns of brain activity
to previous studies of adolescents, namely greater fronto-parietal
activity during encoding of novel stimuli, as well as greater
hippocampal response relative to LD (Dager et al., 2014b). This
study also examined brain activity associated with recognition
for the first time, and found less insular activity during correct
recognition in HD vs. LD, a finding the authors believed could
reflect less arousal during correct recognition or a different task
approach that resulted in similar task performance (Dager et al.,
2014b).
Decision Making and Reward Processing
A number of studies have investigated the neural correlates of
risky decision making and reward processing across monetary
decision making tasks in young BD. A study using the Iowa
Gambling Task found that compared with their peers, adolescent
BD had greater insular and amygdala activity, suggesting greater
emotion-driven decision making in the BD (Xiao et al., 2013),
but this task did not permit the dissociation of decision
making-related activation from reward processing. A subsequent
longitudinal study used a modified Wheel of Fortune Task,
in which BD showed reduced dorsal striatum activity during
risky vs. safe decision making, and similar to previous studies,
reductions in fronto-parietal activity preceded the onset of heavy
drinking (Jones et al., 2016). It is possible that feedback during
risk taking could modify behavior and cognitive control as young
adult BD decreased their risk taking when they were presented
with information about potential monetary losses, and this was
associated with increased recruitment of IFG (Worbe et al., 2014).
Finally, processing of reward receipt was related to decreased
cerebellar activity in a longitudinal study of BD, suggesting
blunted reward and affect-related responses as a result of heavy
episodic drinking (Cservenka et al., 2015). Based on these results,
a general pattern that is emerging is related to alterations in
cognitive control and emotional processing brain regions that
may be modifiable when feedback about the consequences of risk
taking are presented.
Alcohol Cue Reactivity
Alcohol cue reactivity studies have found greater neural response
in reward and emotional processing brain regions among
individuals with AUD (Heinz et al., 2009). Alterations in
motivational neurocircuitry are associated with AUD (Koob and
Volkow, 2010) and have thus been investigated in young adult
and adolescent BD/HD. Dager et al. (2013) reported that young
adult HD had greater neural activity in response to alcohol-
related images in widespread areas comprised of limbic, visual,
frontal, and insular regions compared with LD. Further, in a
task where participants were instructed not to focus on alcohol
cues, ventral tegmental area activation was elevated in young
adult HD compared with neural response seen to soft drink
cues, suggesting automatic processing of alcohol-related stimuli
that may increase motivational drive in mesolimbic circuitry
(Kreusch et al., 2015). Interestingly, response to alcohol cues
may be used to predict drinking behavior in young adult HD
as those who showed elevated response in fronto-striatal areas
and the insula subsequently transitioned into heavy drinking
(Dager et al., 2014a). A longitudinal study of adolescent HD
showed that increased brain activity to alcohol cues in HD vs.
controls diminishes with abstinence from alcohol, indicating that
a decline in risky drinking may modify brain activity in response
to alcohol-related stimuli (Brumback et al., 2015). Across these
studies, there is evidence that mesolimbic and motivational
circuitry may be important targets for studies designed to reduce
response to alcohol cues in adolescent and young adult HD.
Socio-Cognitive and Socio-Emotional
Processing
Research on the effects of binge and heavy drinking on the
developing brain are limited in other domains, such as socio-
cognitive and socio-emotional processing. While recent meta-
analyses highlight deficits in social cognition in individuals with
AUD (Onuoha et al., 2016; Bora and Zorlu, 2017), there are a
lack of fMRI studies in this area within young BD/HD. In one
study, young adult BD categorizing vocal affective stimuli had
less activity in STG, but more activity in MFG compared with
their peers (Maurage et al., 2013). Given the large gap in the
literature specifically focused on socio-cognitive processing in
young BD/HD, future research should further investigate this
domain.
CONCLUSIONS
Binge drinking among youth is associated with smaller/thinner
cortical and subcortical structures and decreased WM integrity.
Consistent across many fMRI studies of cognitive control,

Youth Binge and Heavy Drinking
WrkM, and verbal learning, young BD and HD show greater
reliance on fronto-parietal systems while performing these tasks
(Schweinsburg et al., 2010, 2011; Squeglia et al., 2012a; Wetherill
et al., 2013; Dager et al., 2014b). Executive functioning and
emotional processing systems are important networks for future
investigations related to decision making and reward processing
(Xiao et al., 2013; Worbe et al., 2014; Cservenka et al., 2015; Jones
et al., 2016), while mesolimbic circuitry is likely involved in the
elevated response to alcohol cues in young BD/HD (Dager et al.,
2013, 2014a; Brumback et al., 2015; Kreusch et al., 2015). These
findings suggest there may be neural alterations as a result of
heavy alcohol use or neural risk markers related to vulnerability
toward heavy drinking during adolescence and young adulthood.
While some findings have been replicated, greater efforts are
needed for consistency across task variations, analyses reported,
inclusionary criteria for BD/HD, as well as longitudinal studies of
this topic.
