Abstract 
The spread of drug-resistant bacterial pathogens pose a major threat to global health. 
It is widely recognised that the widespread use of antibiotics has generated selective 
pressures that have driven the emergence of resistant strains. Methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first observed in 1960, less than one year after 
the introduction of this second generation b-lactam antibiotic into clinical practice. 
Epidemiological evidence has always suggested that resistance arose around this 
period, when the mecA gene encoding methicillin resistance carried on an SCCmec 
element, was horizontally transferred to an intrinsically sensitive strain of S. aureus.  
Whole genome sequencing a collection of the very first MRSA isolates allowed us to 
reconstruct the evolutionary history of the archetypal MRSA. Bayesian phylogenetic 
reconstruction was applied to infer the time point at which this early MRSA lineage 
arose and when SCCmec was acquired. MRSA emerged in the mid 1940s, following 
the acquisition of an ancestral type I SCCmec element, some fourteen years prior to 
the first therapeutic use of methicillin. Methicillin use was not the original driving 
factor in the evolution of MRSA as previously thought. Rather it was the widespread 
use of first generation b-lactams such as penicillin in the years prior to the 
introduction of methicillin, which selected for S. aureus strains carrying the mecA 
determinant. Crucially this highlights how new drugs, introduced to circumvent 
known resistance mechanisms, can be rendered ineffective by unrecognised 
adaptations in the bacterial population due to the historic selective landscape created 
by the widespread use of other antibiotics.

Introduction 
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been identified as one of the 
major risk pathogens associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance 
(AMR). The emergence of AMR in S. aureus is well documented and the species has 
proven particularly adept at evolving resistance in the face of new antibiotic 
challenges. The introduction of penicillin in the 1940s heralded a revolution in the 
treatment of infectious diseases. However at the same time as its use was becoming 
more widespread following advances in the scaling up of production, evidence of 
penicillin resistance in S. aureus was already being uncovered (Kirby 1944).  
 
Methicillin (Celbenin), a semi-synthetic b-lactam, was introduced in the UK in 1959 
to circumvent growing penicillin resistance in S. aureus, associated with the 
acquisition of a b-lactamase enzyme, blaZ (Knox 1960). As a second-generation b-
lactam antibiotic, methicillin was insensitive to breakdown by BlaZ. Following the 
introduction of methicillin into clinical practice in the UK the Staphylococcal 
Reference Laboratory in Colindale (London, England) screened S. aureus isolates for 
evidence of resistance to this antibiotic (Jevons 1961). More than 5000 S. aureus 
strains were assessed in the period between October 1959 and November 1960, and in 
October 1960 three isolates showing increased minimum inhibitory concentrations 
(MICs) to the new drug, methicillin, were identified. The isolates originated from the 
same hospital and shared a common phage type and resistance profile (penicillin, 
streptomycin and tetracycline) suggesting that they were related. In the description of 
these isolates it was noted that methicillin had been used only once previously at this 
hospital, and that none of the individuals from whom MRSA was isolated had been 
exposed to the drug. Within two years MRSA was being detected elsewhere in

Europe, with invasive infections being identified in Denmark (Eriksen and Erichsen 
1964). These MRSA isolates from the UK and Denmark in the early 1960s constitute 
the very first epidemic MRSA clone. 
 
The genetic basis of methicillin resistance in S. aureus is associated with carriage of a 
mobile cassette of genes known as the Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec 
(SCCmec) (Katayama et al. 2000). Within this cassette is the mecA gene that is 
responsible for resistance to b-lactams including methicillin. The product of mecA is 
the peptidoglycan synthesis enzyme penicillin binding protein (PBP) 2a involved in 
cross-linking of peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall (Hartman and Tomasz 1984; 
Matthews and Tomasz 1990). PBP2a has a lower binding affinity for b-lactam 
antibiotics than the native PBP proteins encoded in the core genome of S. aureus. The 
subsequent combination of reduced penicillin-binding affinity and increased 
production PBP2a accounts for the observed resistance to b-lactam antibiotics.  
 
Genetic analyses of the first MRSA by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) 
demonstrated that they were sequence type (ST) 250, a lineage belonging to clonal 
complex (CC) 8 and carried the type I SCCmec element (Crisóstomo et al. 2001; 
Enright et al. 2002). After emerging in the UK, this first epidemic MRSA clone 
(ST250-MRSA-I) spread across Europe during the 1960s and 70s, but by the late 
1980s had become less prevalent and is now rarely reported (Enright et al. 2002; 
Oliveira et al. 2002; Gomes et al. 2006). The single locus variant and close relative of 
ST250-MRSA-I, ST247-MRSA-I was first detected in Denmark 1964 (Crisóstomo et 
al. 2001) and has been more successful, spreading globally and persisting as a source 
of outbreaks in Europe into the late 1990s (Oliveira et al. 2002; Gomes et al. 2006),

but this too has been superseded by more successful contemporary clones (Oliveira et 
al. 2002). Five decades on since the appearance of the first MRSA, multiple MRSA 
lineages have emerged which have acquired different variants of SCCmec elements.  
 
Epidemiological evidence has always suggested that MRSA arose following, and 
probably as a consequence of, the introduction of methicillin into clinical practice. 
However exactly when SCCmec was acquired by S. aureus has never before been 
determined. Here we have used whole genome sequencing of a collection of 209 of 
the earliest MRSA isolates recovered in Europe between 1960 and 1989 to reconstruct 
the evolutionary history of methicillin resistance. Using Bayesian phylogenetic 
reconstruction we have identified the likely time point at which this early lineage 
arose and also predicted the time by which SCCmec was acquired. 
 
Results 
Early MRSA belong to a diverse clone  
Preserved in the culture collection of the Staphylococcal Reference Laboratory at 
Public Health England are representatives of the very first MRSA identified. These 
original isolates have been preserved as freeze-dried cultures, and have not been 
repeatedly passaged over the years. One hundred and eighty eight isolates that 
represented the earliest MRSA were recovered from the ampoules and their genomes 
sequenced (Supplementary Table 1). All the isolates belonged to CC8 MRSA and 
were originally isolated between 1960 and the late 1970s, and included eight isolates 
from the original study describing MRSA in 1961 (Jevons 1961). In addition, 21 CC8 
MRSA isolated between 1964 and 1989 in Denmark (Crisóstomo et al. 2001; Gomes 
et al. 2006) were sequenced, as representatives of the earliest MRSA detected

elsewhere in Europe. We also included early methicillin sensitive isolates of ST250 or 
ST247 (n=11), however only a limited number of these were found in the reference 
laboratory collection. 
 
Analysis of the MLST of the isolates identified two main groups, ST250 (n=126), and 
a single locus variant (SLV), ST247 (n=78), plus two novel SLVs of ST247 (n=4) 
(Supplementary Table 1). A supplementary isolate from the Public Health England 
collection was included to provide an outgroup for the analysis; 
RH12000692_7401696 is an MRSA which was collected in 1967 and is a triple locus 
variant of ST250 (Supplementary Table 1). 
 
The S. aureus isolate COL, a representative member of this early MRSA lineage first 
identified in the 1960s (Dyke et al. 1966) had previously been fully sequenced, and 
the chromosome was used as a reference for mapping. Following exclusion of mobile 
genetic elements (MGEs) and predicted recombination events in the collection, a total 
of 4220 SNPs were identified and used to construct a phylogeny (Figure 1A). The 
population framework revealed a diverse population structure containing several 
distinct clades. The mapping of the ST information on to the phylogeny reveals that 
the ST250 population is basal to the ST247, suggesting that ST247 emerged from 
ST250, which is consistent with the epidemiological evidence, and supports the 
hypothesis that this pandemic multidrug-resistant MRSA clone emerged out of the 
ancestral MRSA genotype (Crisóstomo et al. 2001; Enright et al. 2002).  
 
Highlighted in the expanded view (Figure 1B) are the isolates from the Jevons study, 
derived from three individuals at the same hospital in the South London area between

July and November 1960 (Jevons 1961). The isolation source and resistance profiles 
of these isolates are shown in Supplementary Table 2. These isolates are genetically 
very closely related differing by seven SNPs only. Present within this cluster are 
additional isolates from the Public Health England collection originating between 
1960 and 1961. Full epidemiological data is not available for these, but two of these 
isolates were identified in the same region as the hospital where the original Jevons 
study isolates originated. The genetic distance between isolates and their phylogenetic 
relationships suggests there was transmission within the hospital between patients A 
and C and nurse B, and that they were also transmitted beyond the hospital as part of 
a local outbreak. 
 
Although all of the Jevons isolates are confined to a single clade, other isolates from 
the early 1960s are distributed throughout the entire phylogeny (Figure 2). This 
suggests that the earliest MRSA circulating in the UK were not from a single recently 
emerged clone, but were representatives of an established population. In addition to 
the UK isolates, there were 21 from Denmark, which represent the earliest MRSA 
detected outside the UK. These derive from 1964 onwards, and include the youngest 
isolates within the collection from the late 1980s. The Danish isolates are found in 
three clusters distributed throughout the phylogeny (Figure 1A) suggesting that, like 
the early UK MRSA, they originated from an established and diverse population.  
 
Genetic basis of resistance to methicillin and other antibiotics in the archetypal 
MRSA population 
Previous studies have shown that the archaic MRSA clone carried a type I SCCmec 
element, which was the first type of this MGE family to be classified (Katayama et al.

2000; Ito et al. 2001). Notably the description of the type I element was based upon 
the SCCmec derived from S. aureus strain NCTC10442 identified in the 1960 Jevons 
study (Supplementary Table 2 and Figure 1B) (Ito et al. 2001). The type I element 
carries mecA as its only resistance gene in combination with a truncated gene 
encoding the MecRI regulatory protein (together known as a class B mec gene 
complex) with type 1 chromosomal recombinases (ccrA1 and ccrB1). The original 
description of SCCmec type I identified the presence of a frameshift mutation in 
ccrB1 which disrupts the translation of this site specific recombinase (Ito et al. 2001). 
In the collection, 193 of the isolates contained intact SCCmec elements carrying the 
mecA gene (Figure 2). Of these 192 were SCCmec type I elements, all of which 
contained the NCTC10442-type frameshift mutation in ccrB1. The only non-type I 
element identified in the collection was in the outgroup isolate 
RH12000692_7401696, which contained a type IVh SCCmec element. The remaining 
16 isolates lacking SCCmec elements were distributed throughout the phylogeny 
(Figure 2), suggesting that these represent MSSA arising from the loss of the type I 
SCCmec element, rather than forming an ancestral MSSA population. 
 
In addition to methicillin resistance, the first MRSA described were also resistant to 
penicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline (Jevons 1961). Analysis of the genomes of 
these isolates identified blaZ and tetK genes conferring resistance to penicillin and 
tetracycline respectively, but failed to identify the str or aad9 genes associated with 
streptomycin resistance in S. aureus. In the absence of an acquired resistance gene, 
the core genome was examined for mutations potentially responsible for resistance to 
streptomycin. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, mutations in the ribosomal protein 
RpsL were shown to confer streptomycin resistance, including the substitution of an

arginine for a lysine residue at residue 43 (Huang et al. 2003). Alignment of the M. 
tuberculosis and S. aureus sequences revealed that RpsL in the Jevons isolates 
contained an arginine in the equivalent position, residue 56. Comparison with RpsL 
sequences in the public sequence databases showed that in S. aureus the frequent 
amino acid residue at position 56 was lysine. Examining the whole collection, all but 
one of the sequenced isolates contained the arginine residue at position 56, the 
exception being the outgroup isolate RH12000692_7401696 (Figure 2). This 
demonstrates that the non-synonymous substitution resulting in an arginine for a 
lysine residue at residue 56 (K56R) occurred most likely very early during emergence 
of the archetypal MRSA population. 
 
Analysis of the resistomes of the isolates revealed genetic resistance determinants to 
numerous other antibiotics, including: penicillin (blaZ), erythromycin (ermA and 
linA), kanamycin (aadD), gentamicin and kanamycin (aacA-aphD), spectinomycin 
and streptomycin (aad9), and chloramphenicol (catA1, catA2 and catA3), fusidic acid 
(fusA P404L) and trimethoprim (dfrA F99Y), as well as well as genes associated with 
decreased susceptibility to disinfectants (qacA and qacC). The frequency and 
widespread dispersal of these determinants reveals the strong selective pressure 
exerted by antibiotics on the archetypal MRSA clone over an extensive period. 
Examining their distribution in the context of the phylogeny shows that some of these 
traits have been co-acquired (Figure 2), such as ermA and aad9 which are carried on 
Tn554, and that these acquisition events can be mapped on to the phylogeny (Murphy 
et al. 1985).

To determine if the methicillin resistance emerged once or multiple times in the 
archetypal MRSA population we examined the variation within the SCCmec type I 
elements. In total, 194 variant sites were identified in 192 elements present in the 
collection. Analysis of the distribution of the variation within the elements suggested 
that some could be attributed to homologous recombination. Two regions contained 
the majority of the variation: 124 SNP sites were identified in the gene encoding the 
LPxTG surface protein pls, and 31 SNP sites within a 549 bp intergenic region 
between a hypothetical protein (SACOL0030) and a glycerophosphoryl diester 
phosphodiesterase (SACOL0031). Excluding these predicted recombination regions, 
39 core variants sites across 28.6 kb distinguished the 192 elements, with half of the 
isolates (n=96) carrying an identical element. The maximum SNP distance 
distinguishing any two elements was eight SNPs, and phylogenetic analysis revealed 
that the elements present in the historic MRSA clone were closely related 
(Supplementary Figure 1) and shared a common evolutionary origin. 
 
Our analysis of the evolutionary events surrounding the emergence of methicillin 
resistance in the archetypal MRSA lineage focused on a subset of 122 isolates that 
had precise dates of isolation (Supplementary Table 1). This enabled us to generate a 
robust Bayesian phylogeny and temporal calibration. Examining the distribution of 
the type I SCCmec variants (Figure 3A) within the context of a core genome 
phylogeny generated with BEAST (Figure 3B) reveal congruence between the 
phylogenetic relationships of the two. All of the canonical SNPs associated with the 
SCCmec genotypes could be singularly mapped onto nodes of the core phylogeny, 
suggesting that the variation observed in the SCCmec elements had occurred during 
expansion of the ST250 and ST247 populations. On the basis of this, we propose that

a type I SCCmec element was acquired once in a single primordial development of 
methicillin resistance (Figure 3B), that could be dated back to the emergence of this 
clone.  
 
We utilized Bayesian phylogenetic methods applying combinations of molecular 
clock models. The combination of an exponential population and relaxed-log normal 
clock model was found to be the best fit to our data based on Bayes factors using the 
harmonic mean estimator. This indicated the time to most recent common ancestor 
(TMRCA) of the ST250/ST247 population was 1946 (95% highest posterior density 
(HPD) 1938-1952) (Supplementary Figure 2), and therefore the time of acquisition of 
SCCmec was likely to around, or before this date. Notably, the time to most recent 
common ancestor of the type I SCCmec elements in these isolates based on a linear 
regression of a core SNP phylogeny was predicted to be early 1941 (Supplementary 
Figure 3). 
 
To ensure that the Bayesian result was not an artifact of the clock or population 
models used in the analysis, we calculated the TMRCA for a range of model 
combinations and found that our chosen model exhibited a predicted TMRCA that 
was encompassed by the 95% HPDs of all other model combinations (Figure 4).  
 
Discussion 
This historic collection provides unique insights into of the evolution of the first 
MRSA lineage. Preserved for decades in their original freeze-dried state this large 
collection of strains representing the earliest MRSA clone has allowed us to 
reconstruct the evolutionary events leading to the emergence of MRSA. Using whole

genome sequencing we have been able to shed light on the time when SCCmec first 
entered into S. aureus, and also to estimate how many times this is likely to have 
happened in the archaic MRSA population. 
 
The origins of SCCmec almost certainly lie in coagulase negative staphylococci 
(CoNS) (Couto et al. 1996). S. aureus belonging to the ST250 background appear to 
have been the first recipient in the transfer from CoNS, but whether the element 
entered the ST250 population on multiple occasions, or as a single isolated event with 
subsequent propagation through the population has never been definitively resolved. 
A single entry of mecA followed by its evolution within the recipient background has 
been suggested (Kreiswirth et al. 1993). In order to clarify this we examined the 
variation present within the SCCmec elements in isolates throughout the population. 
The variation seen within SCCmec is predominantly in the pls gene which has been 
described before (Shore et al. 2005). Functionality of this 230 kDa cell wall-anchored 
(CWA) protein remains unclear, but its expression has been shown to reduce adhesion 
to host proteins as well as decrease invasiveness (Juuti et al. 2004). This LPXTG 
surface protein has a highly repetitive D/S rich structure making it a target for 
homologous recombination. As noted in other lineages the CWA proteins are subject 
to diversifying selection and exhibit diversity between and within S. aureus lineages 
(Santos-Júnior et al. 2016; Murphy et al. 2011). Removal of this variation reveals that 
the evolutionary history of the SCCmec elements was congruent with that of the 
strains carrying them, which points towards a single acquisition, rather than multiple 
or recurrent horizontal transmissions. Supporting this hypothesis is the observation of 
a mutation in ccrB1 gene of the SCCmec type I element. The recombinase genes are 
required for both integration and excision from the chromosome. Specifically, CcrB is

required for excision and the mutation present within this NCTCT10442 type I 
SCCmec element is believed to produce a non-functioning recombinase (Misiura et al. 
2013; Noto and Archer 2006). Given that all the isolates in this collection have this 
frameshift mutation, this strongly supports the conclusions of the phylogenetic 
analysis, namely that a type I SCCmec was acquired once in the ST250 background, 
and then became fixed in the population due to defective recombinase apparatus that 
precluded excision.  
 
One of the questions we sought to address in this study was what were the temporal 
events surrounding the emergence of MRSA. With the first reports of MRSA 
occurring only after introduction of methicillin in the UK in 1959 and Denmark in 
1964 it seemed reasonable to conclude that resistance arose after the first clinical use 
of the drug, and resistance therefore developed in S. aureus as an adaptive response 
following exposure to the antibiotic. However the results presented in this 
communication are not consistent this conclusion, since the gene bestowing 
methicillin resistance was likely to have been acquired in the mid 1940s. It was during 
this period that b-lactamase mediated penicillin resistance was becoming widespread 
among clinical isolates of S. aureus. Within four years of the introduction of penicillin 
for the treatment of staphylococcal infections, the first penicillin-resistant S. aureus 
were being described in 1944 (Kirby 1944). In the years that followed the frequency 
of resistance in clinical isolates climbed steadily, such that by the time methicillin was 
introduced into clinical practice in 1960, resistance rates of 80% were common 
(Barber and Rozwadowska-Dowzenko 1948; Bauer et al. 1960).

is blaZ, mecA also encodes penicillin resistance via a different mechanism involving 
an alternative penicillin-binding protein, PBP2a (Hartman and Tomasz 1984; Ubukata 
et al. 1989). In the sequenced collection blaZ is widely distributed, albeit at a lower 
frequency than mecA (85.2% of isolates carry the blaZ gene in comparison to 95.2% 
for mecA) suggesting a selective advantage to possessing two distinct b-lactam 
resistance mechanisms. Based on the temporal calibration of the acquisition of mecA, 
it appears likely that methicillin resistance in S. aureus evolved long before this new 
b-lactam antibiotic was introduced. Thus it was the widespread use of penicillin, 
rather than methicillin, that was the driver for the emergence in the archaic MRSA 
clone.  
 
Beyond b-lactams our analysis uncovered evidence for the strong selective impact 
that a number of different antibiotics have had on the evolution of the archaic MRSA 
clone. Several of the antibiotics, such as tetracycline, are prescribed in far lower 
amounts today in human medicine, than in the 1950s and 1960s, and resistance to 
these antibiotics in contemporary S. aureus from humans is relatively rare, which 
contrast the archaic MRSA population, where the distribution of tetracycline 
resistance determinants was widespread (Figure 2; 96% of isolates contained tetK 
or/and tetM) (Aanensen et al. 2016). In a prescient study examining the antibiotic 
consumption and rates of resistance in a hospital in the US in the 1950s, Bauer et al. 
provided evidence of a correlation between the two, where increasing usage of 
tetracycline was associated with an increase in the frequency of tetracycline resistance 
in isolates from inpatients (Bauer et al. 1960).

In addition to methicillin and tetracycline resistances, a key phenotypic marker of the 
archaic MRSA clone was non-susceptibility to streptomycin. In our analysis we 
identified a mutation predicted to confer streptomycin resistance occurring on the 
same branch of the tree in which we mapped the acquisition of the SCCmec element. 
This finding suggests that methicillin and streptomycin resistance both emerged in the 
archetypal MRSA progenitor population around the same time. Discovered in the 
early 1940s, streptomycin was demonstrated to have activity against Gram-positive 
pathogens, and was used in the UK in 1947 during the first ever randomized clinical 
trials studying the efficacy of streptomycin in the treatment of pulmonary TB (Schatz 
et al. 1944; Anonymous 1948). It therefore appears that the first MRSA clone 
emerged, and developed resistance to two of the earliest antibiotics - streptomycin and 
penicillin - almost immediately after the S. aureus population would have been first 
exposed to them. 
 
At the time of its discovery, the incidence of MRSA in the general population is likely 
to have been very low. This is demonstrated by the fact that screening of over 5000 
samples at Public Health England yielded only three methicillin resistant isolates. 
Therefore it is likely that when methicillin was introduced to circumvent penicillin 
resistance in S. aureus, it did not select for emergence of MRSA at that time, but 
instead provided the selective pressure, which drove the nosocomial spread of a pre-
existing variant, at a time when infection control measures in UK hospitals were 
limited.  
 
This study highlights the unintended consequences of widespread antibiotic use, and 
how when new drugs are introduced to bypass known resistance mechanisms, they

may be already be rendered ineffective due to unrecognised adaptations accrued in 
response to prior selective pressures exerted by other antibiotics. This remains one of 
the many challenges in tackling the growing problem of AMR and serves to 
emphasise the importance of continual surveillance of pathogen populations for 
evidence of emerging adaptations and resistance patterns in the context of prescribing 
practice.  
 
Methods 
Bacterial isolates 
Two hundred and nine isolates derived from the culture collections of Staphylococcus 
aureus reference laboratory, Public Health England, and isolates originating from the 
Statens Serum Institute collected and analysed by Profs Tomasz, Westh and de 
Lencastre. These correspond a collection of MRSA and MSSA isolates collected 
between 1960 and late 1980s in the UK and Denmark.  
 
One hundred and eighty eight isolates preserved as freeze-dried cultures in the Health 
Protection England (HPA) Staphylococcal Reference Laboratory were resurrected and 
grown on solid media. Prior to the start of this study the Reference Laboratory 
sequence typed the all isolates from 1960 and 1961 using standard MLST techniques 
(Enright et al. 2000), and identified that the isolates belonged to clonal complex (CC) 
8 and were either sequence type (ST) 250 or 247.  
 
Twenty one CC8 MRSA isolated in Denmark between 1964 and 1989 were also 
included in this study. These isolates originating from the Statens Serum Institute and 
had been previous sequence typed using standard MLST techniques (Enright et al.

2000). All isolates in this study were subsequently sequence typed from their whole 
genome sequence (WGS) data (see below).  
 
Genomic library preparation and sequencing  
Genomic DNA was isolated using the Qiagen QIAcube system according to 
manufacturer’s protocol.  
 
We prepared sequencing libraries from 500ng of DNA extracted from each MRSA 
isolate as previously described, with amplification using Kapa Hifi polymerase (Kapa 
Biosystems, Woburn, MA, USA) (Hsu et al. 2015). Tagged DNA libraries were 
created using a method adapted from a standard Illumina Indexing protocol, as 
described previously (Hsu et al. 2015). Whole genome sequencing was performed on 
the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with 100 bp paired-end reads. The Illumina 
sequence data has been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and the 
accession numbers are provided in Supplementary Table 1. 
 
Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis  
The sequence reads for each representative isolate (n=209) were aligned against the 
reference genome of the MRSA S. aureus COL (accession number: CP000046) (Gill 
et al. 2005) using SMALT (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/smalt-0) and SNPs 
(single nucleotide polymorphisms) and indels (insertions/ deletions) identified as 
described previously (Hsu et al. 2015). Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) identified in 
the COL reference sequence by manual curation of BLASTN pairwise visualized in 
ACT (Carver et al. 2005). Regions of recombination within core genome and 
SCCmec element alignments were identified using Gubbins

(http://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Gubbins) (Croucher et al. 2014). 
Phylogenetic reconstruction using core SNPs was performed with RAxML 
(Stamatakis 2014). Regions of high-SNP density corresponding to putative regions of 
recombination and those SNPs associated with horizontal gene transfer were 
excluded.  
 
In order to investigate if the genomic data contained evidence of a temporal signal we 
used root to tip linear regression using Path-O-Gen v.1.4 
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tempest/)(Supplementary Figure 4). A core 
alignment for 122 isolates for which precise dates of isolation were available was 
used. MGEs and regions of predicted recombination along with homplastic SNPs 
within these isolates were then also excluded. To estimate evolutionary rates and time 
to most common recent ancestor (TMRCA) Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction was 
performed using BEAST (v.1.7.4) (Drummond et al. 2012). A GTR model with a 
gamma correction for among-site rate variation was used, and all combinations of 
strict, relaxed lognormal, and relaxed exponential clock models and constant, 
exponential, expansion, and skyline population models were evaluated. For each, 
three independent chains were run for 100 million generations, sampling every 10 
generations. On completion each model was checked for convergence, both by 
checking effective sample size (ESS) values were greater than 200 for key 
parameters, and by checking independent runs had converged on similar results. 
Models were compared for their fit to the data using Bayes factors based on the 
harmonic mean estimator as calculated by the program Tracer v.1.4 from the BEAST 
package. A burn-in of 10 million states was removed from each of the three

independent runs of this model before combining the results from those runs with the 
logcombiner program from the BEAST package. 
 
A previously described database of sequences of known resistance determinant genes, 
both horizontally acquired and core, was utilized as a resistome database (Holden et 
al. 2013). Fastq files from the 209 isolates were mapped to the resistome database 
using SRST2 (Inouye et al. 2014). SNPs in chromosomally encoded genes previously 
identified as being associated with antimicrobial resistance were then manually 
inspected to confirm the variation.  
 
Multilocus Sequence Type (MLST) of isolates was predicted using SRST2 (Inouye et 
al. 2014).  
 
Data access 
Short reads for all sequenced isolates have been submitted to the European Nucleotide 
Archive (ENA; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/) under study accession number 
ERP001103. Individual accession numbers of sequences and assemblies for all 
isolates are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Distribution antibiotic resistance determinants in the archetypal MRSA clone.  
A maximum likelihood tree of historic MRSA isolates (n=209) plus the COL 
reference is displayed on the left, and the panels on the right indicate dates of 
isolation (coloured according to year, see key below for years), and the presence 
(purple boxes) and absence (white space) of genetic determinants responsible for 
antibiotic resistance in the genomes of the isolates. The identity of genetic 
determinants are listed at the top, and divided into acquired genes (red text), and core 
mutations (green text). The antibiotics linked to the genetic determinants for the 
acquired genes are: b-lactams blaZ and mecA; chloramphenicol, catA1, catA2, and 
catA3; erythromycin, ermA; clindamycin, linA; aminoglycosides, aacA-aphD, aad9, 
aadD, aph3A, and str; tetracycline, tetM and tetK; disinfectants, qacA and qacC; and 
for the core gene mutations: streptomycin substitution of arginine for a lysine at 
residue 56 (K56R) of the ribosomal protein rpsL; fusidic acid, substitution of a 
proline for a leucine at residue 406 (P404L) of the transcription elongation factor 
fusA; trimethoprim, substitution of an tyrosine for a phenylalanine at residue 99 
(F99Y) of the dihydrofolate reductase dfrA.

A. Parsimonious minimal spanning tree of SCCmec type I elements present in the 
archetypal MRSA isolates present in the clade credibility tree in panel B. The tree is 
built with core SNPs identified in the SCCmec type I elements, and excludes SNP in 
the pls gene that were predicted to have arisen by recombination. In total, 10 
genotypes were observed, and the genetic events that distinguish each genotype from 
the founder genotype are indicated. The tree is centered on the majority genotype 
inferred as the founder population, and colour-coded according to their genotype. 
Black stars indicate isolates that lack the type I SCCmec element. The sizes of the 
circles illustrate the relative sizes of the genotype populations. The key below the tree 
describes the canonical SNPs differentiating SCCmec type I genotypes and the 
number of variants with that genotype. 
B. Maximum clade credibility tree of the archetypal MRSA clone population based on 
BEAST analysis. Tips of the tree are constrained by isolation dates; the time scale is 
shown below the tree. The tree is built with core genome SNPs from a subset of the 
total collection’s isolates (n=122), which had robust provenance and precise dates of 
isolation. The branches of the tree are coloured according to the genotype of the 
SCCmec type I element present in that strain (illustrated in panel 3A). Internal 
branches are coloured according to parsimonious reconstruction of the predicted 
genotype. Where terminal branches are black, this indicates the absence of an 
SCCmec element, which is predicted to reflect loss of the element. An arrow indicates 
the point in the phylogenetic reconstruction where an ancestral of type I SCCmec 
element was acquired. The root of the tree corresponds the basal node of the 
ST250/ST247 population in Figure 1 rooted by the RH12000692_7401696 outgroup. 
From the analysis the estimated mutation rate of population is 1.8x10-6 
SNPs/site/year. This substitution rate falls within the reported ranges of multiple
