Introduction
The act of breathing results in a cyclical flow of air through the
nose, providing an entry point for respiratory entrainment of
neural activity. In mammals, local field potential (LFP) responses
in olfactory bulb and piriform cortex (PC) oscillate in phase with
breathing (Adrian, 1942; Kay and Freeman, 1998; Fontanini et
al., 2003), and when breathing is diverted away from the nose,
these patterns diminish (Fontanini et al., 2003). Based on such
findings, it has been proposed that dynamic oscillatory rhythms
regulate cortical excitability, synchronize activity within cell as-
semblies, and coordinate network interactions, helping to shape
olfactory sensory coding, memory, and behavior (Laurent et al.,
2001; Kay, 2005; Kepecs et al., 2006; Martin and Ravel, 2014).
Breathing is a vital rhythm of mammalian life, replenishing
the bloodstream with oxygen and eliminating carbon dioxide
with essential regularity. Although the respiratory drive is gener-
ated by conditional bursting pacemaker neurons in the brainstem
(Smith et al., 1991, 2009; Garcia et al., 2011), its pace is not fixed:

this study, we collected intracranial EEG data from rare patients with medically intractable epilepsy, and found evidence for
respiratory entrainment of local field potential activity in human piriform cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. These effects
diminished when breathing was diverted to the mouth, highlighting the importance of nasal airflow for generating respiratory
oscillations. Finally, behavioral data in healthy subjects suggest that breathing phase systematically influences cognitive tasks
related to amygdala and hippocampal functions.

 a variety of emotional and cognitive states, including anxiety
(Boiten, 1998), stress (Suess et al., 1980), and exploratory behav-
ior (Welker, 1964; Kay and Freeman, 1998; Verhagen et al., 2007;
Evans et al., 2009; Vlemincx et al., 2011; Huijbers et al., 2014), can
all modify the rate and depth of breathing. The alternative idea,
that respiratory phase exerts a direct impact on emotion and
cognition, is unknown. The fact that the olfactory system is
closely linked with limbic brain regions mediating emotion,
memory, and behavior (Carmichael et al., 1994; LeDoux, 2000;
Eichenbaum et al., 2007) suggests a robust pathway by which
nasal breathing could even shape rhythmic electrical activity in
downstream limbic areas, with corresponding effects on cogni-
tive functions.
In line with these ideas, the power of fast cortical oscillations
can be modulated by rhythmic external events occurring at lower
frequency (Lakatos et al., 2005), with recent animal work reveal-
ing that breathing entrains high-frequency oscillations in both
olfactory brain regions (Rojas-Líbano et al., 2014; Frederick et al.,
2016) and nonolfactory areas, including whisker barrel cortex
(Moore et al., 2013; Ito et al., 2014) and hippocampus (Yanovsky
et al., 2014; Nguyen Chi et al., 2016). Interestingly, new behav-
ioral data in rodents show that sniffing can even impact nonol-
factory behaviors, such as whisking (Cao et al., 2012; Ranade et
al., 2013) and ultrasonic vocalizations (Sirotin et al., 2014). Thus,
data across a wide range of studies and sensory modalities suggest
that respiratory rhythms modulate oscillatory patterns through-
out the brain, with potential impact on stimulus sampling behav-
iors. One broad implication is that breathing subserves more
than just supplying oxygen to the body; it can also organize neu-
ronal population activity across brain regions to orchestrate com-
plex behaviors affiliated with orofacial sensation (Kleinfeld et al.,
2014). Whether respiratory rhythms have a direct influence on
cortical oscillations in the human brain is not well understood.
Here we used intracranial EEG (iEEG) methods to test four
inter-related hypotheses about breathing, the brain, and cogni-
tion. First, we asked whether respiratory-induced oscillations are
present in human PC. Such evidence has been elusive, given that
surface EEG approaches lack the spatial resolution and functional
MRI (fMRI) approaches lack the temporal resolution to identify
oscillatory activity in deeply situated olfactory structures. Sec-
ond, we asked whether respiratory oscillations propagate to
amygdala and hippocampus, and, if so, whether these depend on
airflow stimulation through the nose. This question was designed
to establish a mechanistic basis for our third hypothesis, examin-
ing whether breathing phase systematically influences cognitive
tasks related to amygdala and hippocampal functions. Finally, in
one patient, we directly tested the idea that respiratory oscilla-
tions in the amygdala influence performance on an emotion
judgment task, which would imply that the breathing rhythm can
exert potent control over learning and behavior.
Materials and Methods
Study participants. Participants in the iEEG experiment included seven
patients (three women) with temporal lobe epilepsy whose seizures were
poorly controlled by medication (Table 1, demographic and clinical de-
tails). An eighth patient was specifically recruited to participate in the
emotion judgment task (Table 1, patient P8 details). Patients were re-
cruited for the study only if the planned clinical electrode coverage pro-
vided coverage of PC, amygdala, and/or hippocampus. Behavioral study
participants included a total of 107 healthy human subjects between the
ages of 18 and 30 years. All participants gave informed consent to take
part in the study, and all experiments were approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Northwestern University. During iEEG data acquisi-
tion, patients were asked to sit quietly, breathing naturally for 15 min.
They were asked to keep their eyes open, and one member from the
research team sat in the room with the patient during this time. If patients
became fatigued or the task was interrupted, the experiment was stopped
and resumed later.
Electrophysiology. iEEG data were recorded using a clinical Nihon
Kohden system in place at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH).
The Nihon Kohden recording system allows sampling frequency of up to
2000 Hz, and can reliably handle high-pass filters from 0.08 Hz, thus
allowing the recording of very low-frequency oscillations, well below the
range of natural breathing in humans. The system also allows four DC
input channels. Our data were recorded with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz.
Reference and ground were obtained from a surgically implanted elec-
trode strip that was placed specifically for this purpose, facing away from
the brain (toward the scalp). All data were rereferenced to a common
average before further data analysis. Our rationale for using a common
average reference was based on the fact that this reference could be used
in all of the patients, ensuring consistency of methods across patients.
Depending on clinical needs and surgical approach, electrode coverage
varied across patients. This meant that it was difficult to find an appro-
priate single reference electrode that was in a similar location across
patients.
Electrode locations did not deviate from standard clinical coverage for
medial temporal epilepsy patients at NMH, and included four depth
electrodes, implanted along an oblique coronal plane and (across the
four electrodes) intended to span the long axis of the medial temporal
lobe. As standard clinical procedure at NMH, respiration was recorded
using a piezoelectric pressure sensor attached to a nasal cannula at the
patient’s nose (Salter Labs), and breathing belts placed around the abdo-
men (see Respiratory physiological recordings and analysis, for addi-
tional information). The electrodes used to record LFP data for this study
were eight-contact depth electrodes (Integra Epilepsy, Integra) using the
Leksell frame and Brainlab planning system (iPlan Stereotaxy version 3.0,
Brainlab). Electrodes had 5 mm center-to-center spacing between adja-
cent electrode contacts. Data were recorded in separate blocks of �15
min in length, corresponding to the behavioral tasks performed. Preop-
erative structural MR images were acquired on all patients with a 1.5 T
MRI scanner. Computed tomography (CT) scans were acquired postop-
eratively with subdural electrodes in place, clearly showing electrode
positions with respect to skull geometry. CT scans were aligned to T1
images using the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain Soft-
ware Library (FSL5). Coregistered CT scans underwent visual inspection
and manual translation was performed via MATLAB if major structural
landmarks were still not properly aligned. Electrode localization was then
performed on coregistered CT scans using CTMR implemented in MAT-
LAB (Hermes et al., 2010).
Respiratory physiological recordings and analysis. Our method of mea-
suring respiration varied depending on the task and the location of the
experiment. Respiratory recording methods were as follows, for each
task:
Intracranial EEG recordings in patients who underwent nasal breath-
ing: pressure sensor (Salter Labs). As temporal resolution of the breath-
ing signal was most critical for time locking of the iEEG experiments, this
pressure sensor is the ideal choice for measuring the temporal dynamics
of respiration (Johnson et al., 2006).
Intracranial EEG recordings in patients who underwent both nasal
and oral breathing: abdominal breathing belt (Perfect Fit II Adult
Effort Belt, DyMedix Diagnostics). Because the Salter Labs pressure
sensor is unable to detect changes in oral breathing, we used an ab-
dominal breathing belt, enabling us to compare nasal and oral breath-
ing from the same patient using the same breathing device. Therefore,
any differences in spectral power between nasal and oral breathing
cannot be attributed to differences in the respiratory measurement
technique.
Behavioralrecordingsinhealthysubjectsparticipatinginthenasalbreath-
ing version of the emotion and memory tasks: pneumotachometer (4719
Series, 0–100 LPM, Hans Rudolph), which uses a flow head connected to a
fine mesh stainless steel screen to generate a pressure signal proportional to
the airflow rate. The response-time performance of this device has been
found to be very similar to that of the pressure sensor (Johnson et al., 2006).

 Behavioral recordings in healthy subjects participating in the oral
breathing version of the emotion and memory tasks: abdominal breath-
ing belts (Siemens).
Behavioral recordings in healthy subjects participating in the con-
trol (nasal breathing with mouth open) version of the emotion and
memory tasks: both pneumotachometer (4719 Series, Hans Rudolph)
and abdominal breathing belt (RX-TSD221-MRI, Biopac Systems).
This enabled us to directly compare the breathing belt data and the
pneumotachometer data.
Respiratory data for iEEG experiments were recorded, digitized, and
filtered (0–15 Hz) on-line through a DC input directly into the Nihon
Kohden clinical EEG recording system. The main goal of off-line analysis
of the breathing time-series data (in MATLAB) was to identify the time of
peak inspiratory flow for each breath (trial) in the respiratory time series.
As noted above, the pressure sensor is coupled to piezo pressure sensor
technology to measure airflow pressure. Because this sensor is positioned
at the nasal cannula, the device is effectively an “open” system (unlike the
“closed” system of a bellows-type respiratory device that measures chest
expansion and/or lung volume). This open system means that the device
is most sensitive to changes in airflow. Thus, the most sensitive point of
the respiratory signal occurs at the maximal inspiratory flow, precisely
where the inflection point from an upward slope (accelerating phase of
inspiration) to a downward slope (decelerating phase of inspiration)
occurs. When the subject has completed an inhalation, but before begin-
ning exhalation, the respiratory signal will begin to return to zero, since at

Zelano et al. • Human Limbic Respiratory Oscillations
 this point the flow of air has ceased. As a result of these temporal dynam-
ics of the breathing signal, the component of the recorded breathing
signal that is most reliably detected using automated MATLAB scripts is
the inspiratory peak airflow.
To obtain reliable estimates of the time-points of peak inspiratory
flow, we computed the instantaneous phase of the respiratory signal,
using the Hilbert transform function in MATLAB (Fig. 1). In this way,
the peak flow could be estimated as the abrupt discontinuity in phase,
which could be easily identified by taking the derivative of the phase of
the respiratory signal (Fig. 1A, green tick marks). Specifically, the respi-
ratory signal was thresholded two times. First, the derivative of the phase
was thresholded to identify sharp peaks corresponding to respiratory
maximal flow. We then further thresholded the value of the physiological
respiratory signal for each identified event to include only those that were
�0.75 SD from the mean, to minimize contributions of signal noise. All
trials were then manually inspected to ensure accuracy. While there are
different methods to determine respiratory peaks, this method was ro-
bust to changes in the timing and amplitude, as well as to occasional noisy
segments, of the breathing signal.
To characterize the rate of natural breathing in each patient, we per-
formed a fast Fourier transform analysis in MATLAB (“pwelch” func-
tion; segment length, 8192 ms; 90% overlap; Hanning window length,
8192 ms). This approach confirmed that the dominant breathing fre-
quency in most patients was 0.24–0.36 Hz, corresponding to 14.4–21.6
breaths/min (Fig. 1B).
LFP data preprocessing. Analyses of the LFP time-series data were per-
formed using MATLAB (MathWorks) and a combination of EEGLAB
code (Delorme and Makeig, 2004), FieldTrip code (Oostenveld et al.,
2011), and in-house code. Interictal spikes were removed using an auto-
mated spike sorting algorithm (Yadav et al., 2011) and manual inspection
of EEG time series. The data were analyzed both with and without spike
removal, with similar results. The following sections provide specific
details about LFP analyses of the slow respiratory oscillations, the higher-
frequency spectral data, and the cross-frequency coupling (CFC).
LFP analysis of slow respiratory oscillations. To determine whether very
low-frequency neural oscillations in the human respiratory range were
coherent with respiration, we focused on the individual averaged LFP
data in each patient separately. Data were analyzed from 15 min periods
of wake during which the patient was resting quietly and breathing
naturally through the nose, during times when the patients were undis-
turbed by visitors, including research and clinical staff. We used a low-
pass filter (�0.6 Hz) for extracting the low-frequency LFP signal
corresponding to the human respiratory range. This procedure also had
the advantage of removing higher-frequency oscillatory effects that
might be aligning to respiration. A two-pass least-square finite-impulse
response (FIR) filter (order � three times the lower frequency bound)
was used to prevent phase distortion. It is worth noting that because our
recording system is only able to record at frequencies �0.08 Hz, this
filtering effectively amounted to a bandpass filter of 0.08–0.6 Hz.
Filtering of the low-frequency signal was performed across the entire
15 min raw LFP time series, which was then divided into separate 6 s trials
aligned to peak inspiratory flow for each respiratory trial (Figs. 2, 3).
These 6 s windows were simply used as the time windows within which
trials were binned, where peak flow was set to 0 s. As such, the �2 s
time-point did not necessarily denote the onset of inspiration, nor did
the �4 s time-point denote the end of the breath. Basically, the 6 s
windows ensured that each breath trial was fully captured in that period
of time; because patients often initiated a second breath within 6 s, we
included only every other respiratory peak in the spectral analysis to
eliminate data overlap across trials.
Respiratory and LFP trials (each of 6 s duration, aligned to peak in-
spiratory flow at 0 s) were then averaged, and the linear correlation was

 computed and Fisher z-transformed. To assess statistical significance, the
same procedure was followed, but using 6 s windows of LFP data that
were aligned to random time points with regard to the peak flow onset
times in the respiratory data (Fig. 3). This process was repeated 1000
times to generate a statistically null distribution of R values. Comparison
of each patient’s actual R value to their R-null distribution enabled us to
derive a p value (such that an effect was significant if the actual value fell
within the top 5% of the distribution).
LFP spectral analysis of higher-frequency oscillations. To determine
whether respiratory phase entrains higher-frequency oscillations across
limbic brain regions, we computed spectrograms in each region for each
patient individually (Fig. 4A–C, left columns). Time–frequency decom-
position of the neural time-series data was conducted using a filter-
Hilbert approach, a widely accepted algorithm for analysis of EEG time
series (Bruns, 2004; Canolty et al., 2006; Cohen, 2014; Szczepanski et al.,
2014). First, we used a two-pass FIR filter (order � three times the lower
frequency bound), to create 101 log-spaced frequency steps, with center
frequencies ranging from 1 to 200 Hz, and with frequency bandwidths
(window sizes) logarithmically increasing in 101 steps from 1 to 10 Hz.
These procedures were applied to the entire 15 min raw LFP time series
individually for each patient.
Next, the instantaneous amplitude at each time point and each fre-
quency band was extracted using the element-wise modulus of the Hil-
bert transform, and then the resulting amplitude time series were
segmented into 6 s epochs, centered at the peak inspiratory flow at 0 s.
Spectrograms were then created by averaging across all trials, followed by
temporal smoothing with a moving average window of 10 ms. As was
done for the LFP analysis of slow respiratory oscillations, we used a 6 s
window to ensure that at least one breath trial was fully captured in that
period of time, and only entered every other respiratory peak into this
analysis to minimize data overlap between breaths.
Finally, the spectrogram was normalized (per frequency) by subtract-
ing the mean amplitude from 0.2 to 0.8 s (depicted as a thick black bar on
the horizontal axis of all spectrograms (Figs. 4, 5, 6). The significance of
amplitude changes was determined using a bootstrap method (Canolty et
al., 2007). In brief, the actual inspiratory peaks were circularly shifted by
a random amount while reserving the number of samples between suc-
cessive trials. Surrogate mean amplitudes were obtained by averaging the
amplitude of the surrogate indices. A distribution of surrogate values was
obtained after repeating this procedure 10,000 times. The z-scored actual
mean amplitude change was calculated by dividing the mean amplitude
change by the SD of the surrogate ensample. The z maps were then
thresholded for statistical significance using false discovery rate (FDR)
correction for multiple comparisons (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).
Frequency bands were defined as follows: delta band, 0.5–4 Hz; theta
band, 4–8 Hz; alpha band, 8–13 Hz; beta band, 13–30 Hz; gamma band,
30–200 Hz.
Analysis of cross-frequency coupling. Phase-amplitude coupling was ex-
amined using the modulation index (MI), which is an estimate of the
normalized entropy of the phase-amplitude distribution (Tort et al.,
2008). Analysis of cross-frequency coupling between the low-frequency
phase and higher-frequency amplitude involved three steps. The first
step was designed to extract instantaneous phase data across a set of low
frequencies between 1 and 10 Hz. To this end, a two-pass FIR filter
(order � three times the lower frequency bound) was used to create 19
equally spaced frequency steps across the full 15 min LFP time series, with
center frequencies ranging from 1 to 10 Hz, and with fixed-frequency
bandwidths of 2 Hz. These parameters provided sufficient sensitivity to
assess most of the lower end of the delta band. The instantaneous phase
was then determined from the element-wise angle of the Hilbert-
transformed signal for each of the 19 frequency steps.
The second step was designed to extract instantaneous amplitude data
across a set of higher frequencies between 13 and 200 Hz. To this end, a
two-pass FIR filter (order � three times the lower-frequency bound) was
used to create 100 log-spaced frequency steps over the 15 min LFP time
series, with center frequencies between 13 and 200 Hz, and with frequency
bandwidths logarithmically increasing between 4 and 50 Hz. The instanta-
neous amplitude was then determined from the element-wise modulus of
the Hilbert-transformed signal for each of the 100 frequency steps.
ThefinalstepinvolvedcomputationoftheMI.Foreachphase-amplitude
combination, a histogram of amplitude values was generated using 20 phase
bins. Following published methods (Tort et al., 2008), the entropy of each
phase-amplitude histogram was computed to generate MI values for each
combination. These values were then plotted onto a 2-D comodulogram
(Fig.7).To test the significance of the modulation index, 200 surrogate
modulation indices that were calculated using a combined, randomly
shifted phase and the amplitude time series were obtained (Canolty et
al., 2006). The z-scored modulation index was obtained by subtract-
ing the surrogate mean value from the actual modulation index,
which was then divided by the SD of the surrogate distribution.
Emotion recognition task. A total of 70 healthy subjects between the
ages of 18 and 30 years participated in this task: 24 subjects performed the
task during nasal respiration (13 women), 18 subjects performed the task
during oral respiration (12 women), and 28 subjects performed the task
during nasal respiration with the mouth held open as an attentional
control (18 women). In the nasal version of the task, 3 of the 24 nasal
subjects were excluded (1 subject fell asleep during the task, 1 subject had
nasal congestion resulting in difficulty breathing through the nose, and 1
subject had an excessive number of missed trials across the session),
leaving a total of 21 subjects. In the oral version of the task, 1 of the 18
subjects was excluded because her nasal airway was not properly blocked,
leaving a total of 17 subjects. In the attentional control task, 4 subjects
were excluded (3 subjects due to technical problems with the respiratory
recording equipment, and 1 subject had an excessive number of missed
trials), leaving a total of 24 subjects. Thus, there was a total of 62 healthy
subjects who completed these studies.
Before the start of the experiment, subjects were affixed with either a
pneumotachometer positioned in front of the nostrils (nasal task) or
with a pair of breathing belts placed around the abdomen (oral task). For
subjects taking part in the oral version of the task, a small piece of tape
was lightly placed across the nostrils to minimize nasal contributions to
breathing. For subjects taking part in the attentional control task, a pneu-
motachometer and an abdominal breathing belt were both affixed. These
subjects were asked to breathe through their nose while holding their
mouths open.
The emotion task consisted of viewing a set of faces with either a fearful
or surprised expression (see Fig. 8). The task was presented on a Mac-
book Pro using PsychToolbox (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997) through
MATLAB. On each trial, a stimulus was presented for 100 ms, with an
intertrial interval (ITI) randomly jittered between 2 and 5 s (mean ITI,
3.5 s) to ensure that stimuli fully “tiled” all phases of the respiratory cycle.
Upon viewing a face, subjects had to indicate by pushbutton as quickly
and accurately as possible whether an expression of fear or surprise was
present, using the buttons (buttons “1” and “2”) on a computer key-
board. In total, 18 different faces were presented in each task, with each
face repeated 10 times. There was a total of 180 emotion recognition trials
occurring within a single session of 11 min. The intertrial interval re-
ported (average, 3.5 s) was programmed to include the response time
(RT). Thus, to record a response, participants were forced to respond
within the ITI. This was because we aimed to have control over the time
between when each stimulus was presented so as to minimize any sys-
tematic lag that could be generated if reaction times varied systematically
with respiration. In addition to the emotion task, subjects also took part
in a control gender discrimination task. In this instance, subjects
viewed faces with either a happy or neutral expression. Task param-
eters were otherwise identical. The order of the emotion and gender
tasks was counterbalanced across subjects. All stimuli came from the
Ekman (1975) face set.
Condition-specific stimulus presentations (fear/surprise faces in the
emotion task; male/female faces in the gender task) were synchronized
with the respiratory trace recorded via PowerLab (ADInstruments). Sub-
sequently, all trials were categorized by respiratory phase, determined by
estimating the angle of the Hilbert transform of the respiratory signal. In
the nasal condition, in which a spirometer was used to record breathing,
trials were categorized as inspiratory trials when the stimulus occurred
between ��/2 and �/2 of the respiratory phase, whereas trials were
categorized as expiratory trials when the stimulus occurred between ��
and ��/2 or between �/2 and � of the respiratory phase. In the oral

 condition, in which a breathing belt was used to record breathing, stimuli
that landed within respiratory phases of �� and 0 were categorized as
inspiratory trials (because of differences in the nature of the breathing
belt signal compared with the spirometer signal), and those that landed
within respiratory phases of 0 and � were categorized as expiratory trials.
At the level of individual subjects, the reaction time of each trial was
square root transformed, and the mean was computed subsequently
across the square root reaction times (within condition). Reaction times
that were 3 SDs above or below the mean were excluded. Mean reaction
times and accuracies were compiled for each subject and condition,
and then submitted to group-level analysis. For reaction time analyses,
incorrect responses were excluded. For group-level analyses, repeated-
measures ANOVAs were performed comparing breathing route, emo-
tion, and phase, followed by confirmatory ANOVAs and t tests.
By recording respiration both via pneumotachometer and breathing
belt during the attentional control task (breathing through the nose with
the mouth held open), we were able to directly compare behavioral re-
sults obtained from the two respiratory recording methods. We found
that it made no difference whether the pneumotachometer or the breath-
ing belt was used to classify fearful faces into the inspiratory or expiratory
phase of breathing: with both techniques, fearful faces were detected
significantly more quickly during inspiration than expiration, as evi-
denced by an ANOVA computed between measure (belt/pnuemotach)
and phase (inhale/exhale). There remained an overall effect of phase
(F(1,23) � 9.31, p � 0.005), and no interaction between measure and
phase (F(1,23) � 0.58, p � 0.45), suggesting that the abdominal breathing
belt provided adequate temporal resolution to resolve the behavioral
trials according to the phase in which they appeared.
Visual object memory task. A total of 42 healthy subjects between the
ages of 18 and 30 years took part in this task (Fig. 9), including 13 subjects
(8 women) enrolled in the nasal version of the task, 13 subjects (9
women) enrolled in the oral version, and 16 subjects (8 women) enrolled
in the control (nasal breathing/mouth open) version. One subject from
the nasal condition was excluded because the pneumotachometer be-
came detached during testing, and one subject from the oral condition
was excluded because her nasal airway (at the nostrils) was not ade-
quately blocked. Four subjects from the attentional nasal condition were
excluded due to experimenter error (the wrong experimental task was
administered). A further subject from each condition was excluded due
to an excessive number of missed trials (�10%), leaving a total of 11
subjects in each condition. Stimuli consisted of objects of various
human-made and organic categories (e.g., buildings, fruits, instru-
ments), obtained from the set available from Moreno-Martínez and
Montoro (2012). A total of 180 of these objects were randomly assigned
to the encoding session. Stimuli were previously ranked in salience, en-
abling us to exclude stimuli within the top or bottom 15% of salience
ratings.
Before the encoding session, subjects were told they would view images
that they would later be asked to recall. During the encoding session (15 min
duration), 180 stimuli were presented for 500 ms. The ITI was randomly
jittered between 3 and 6 s (mean ITI, 4.5 s) to ensure that stimuli fully
spannedallphasesoftherespiratorycycle.Followinga20minbreak(during
which time subjects performed the emotion andgender tasks), subjects took
part in a memory retrieval session, consisting of the 180 “old” stimuli and
180 “new” stimuli. During memory retrieval, subjects were asked to indicate
whether each image had been previously seen during initial encoding (“old)
orhadnotbeenseenbefore(“new”).Allstimuluspresentationtimesinboth
sessions were recorded on-line using PowerLab (ADInstruments), in syn-
chrony with recording of the respiratory signals. Data analysis was per-
formed in MATLAB.
Respiratory phase during each stimulus was determined by estimating
the circular mean of the instantaneous angle of the Hilbert transform of
the breathing signal over the duration of stimulus presentation. Re-
sponses evoked by each object image during retrieval were categorized
into the respiratory phase of either the actual phase of respiration at
retrieval, or the phase of respiration during initial encoding. Respiratory
phase was determined in the same way as described above in the emotion
recognition task. Reaction times (square root transformed) were aver-
aged, and accuracies were computed across condition, phase, and session
of phase for each subject.
Results
To characterize respiratory phase-locked oscillations in the
human brain, we analyzed iEEG data from depth electrodes
inserted into PC, amygdala, and hippocampus in seven surgi-
cal epilepsy patients during natural breathing (five with PC
coverage; all seven with amygdala and hippocampal coverage).
As primary regions of interest, PC and amygdala receive direct
afferent input the olfactory bulb (Carmichael et al., 1994; Root
et al., 2014), and odor-evoked responses have been observed
in human iEEG studies of amygdala (Hughes and Andy, 1979;
Hudry et al., 2001; Jung et al., 2006). Hippocampus is not
formally part of the olfactory network but receives projections
from the olfactory system via the entorhinal cortex (Haberly
and Price, 1978; Carmichael et al., 1994), and, in rodents, slow
rhythmic activity in hippocampus can in some circumstances
fluctuate in phase with nasal respiration (Macrides, 1975;
Macrides et al., 1982; Kay, 2005; Viczko et al., 2014; Yanovsky
et al., 2014; Kleinfeld et al., 2016; Nguyen Chi et al.,
2016).
Slow oscillations in human piriform cortex are in synchrony
with natural breathing
During data acquisition, patients breathed quietly through their
noses, in the absence of odor stimulation, while respiration was
monitored. Our initial analysis tested whether the ongoing
rhythms of natural spontaneous breathing were in synchrony
with slow fluctuations of neuronal activity. Qualitative inspec-
tion of these data suggested that the raw (unfiltered) LFP time
series in PC was often in phase with breathing, with respiratory
entrainment observed in each patient (Fig. 2A). To quantify these
effects, a within-subject “event-related” analysis was performed
in which the inspiratory peaks from the respiratory time series
were used to define event-onset times (Fig. 3). First, the original
LFP time series were filtered from 0 to 0.6 Hz, corresponding to
the human respiratory range. The respiratory time series and the
filtered LFP were then both organized into trials of 6 s duration,
aligned to inspiratory peaks (from �2 to �4 s, with 0 being the
inspiratory peak). Trials were averaged together, enabling us to
compute the temporal correlation between the mean LFP signal
and the mean respiratory signal on a patient-by-patient basis.
This analysis revealed that in PC, the LFP was correlated with
breathing in each patient, with R values ranging from 0.64 to 0.87
(Fig. 2B, red and blue traces).
The statistical significance of this effect was tested by plotting
the correlation value (between LFP and respiratory signals) onto
a distribution of randomly generated R values, in which the mean
LFP signal was created from 6 s trials that were randomly chosen
with respect to the inspiratory peak (Fig. 3). This process was
iterated 1000 times (bootstrapping with resampling), yielding a
statistically null distribution from which a p value could be
calculated. As shown in Figure 2C (left column), the observed
correlation value in PC was consistently outside of the upper
bound of the 95% confidence interval of the randomly gener-
ated distribution for each and every patient, implying a signif-
icant time-series alignment between the LFP signal and
breathing in this brain region (P1: r � 0.64, p � 0.006; P2: r �
0.74, p � 0.008; P3: r � 0.87, p � 0.0001; P4: r � 0.72, p �
0.02; P7: r � 0.64, p � 0.002), and in one patient in hippocam-
pus (P1: r � 0.77, p � 0.005).

 By
comparison,
respiratory-paced
LFP fluctuations in other medial tempo-
ral lobe areas were not reliably aligned
with breathing. In the amygdala (Fig.
2B,C, middle column), the correlation
between neural and respiratory signals
was low in all five patients (R value
range,
0.01–0.25),
none
of
which
reached significance (p value range,
0.1–0.53). In the hippocampus (Fig.
2B,C, right column), correlation values
were nonsignificant in four patients (R
value range, 0.08–0.43; p value range,
0.13–0.44), with only one patient exhib-
iting significant respiratory entrain-
ment (P1: r � 0.77; p � 0.0001).
Together, these results highlight the
specificity of these effects to the piri-
form olfactory area, and show that slow
respiratory oscillations in PC are a char-
acteristic electrophysiological signature
of the human olfactory system, though
at a much slower (�0.16–0.33 Hz) fre-
quency of natural breathing than is ob-
served in other mammalian model
systems.
Respiratory phase entrains higher-
frequency limbic oscillations
Intracranial EEG recordings in animals
and
humans
consistently
show
that
higher-frequency oscillatory power is
modulated
by
the
phase
of
lower-
frequency oscillations, enabling neuronal
coordination across different time-scales (Fries, 2005; Canolty et
al., 2006; Jensen and Colgin, 2007), and in some cases is even
modulated by low-frequency rhythmic events, such as sounds
(Lakatos et al., 2005) or quiet breathing (Moore et al., 2013; Ito et
al., 2014; Rojas-Líbano et al., 2014). To test whether breathing
phase systematically modulates oscillatory amplitudes at faster
frequencies, we computed spectrograms averaged over trials,
time locked to peak inhalation. Increases in oscillatory power
were observed in PC in each and every patient (Fig. 4A), with
spectral changes emerging during the inspiratory phase of
breathing. Oscillatory power changes were consistent across pa-
tients, with statistically significant increases in the delta range
(0.5–4 Hz) in every patient with PC coverage (P1, P2, P3, P4, and
P7; z-scores � 3.2, FDR corrected for multiple corrections). All
five patients with PC coverage also showed an inspiration-locked
increase in the theta range (4–8 Hz), reaching statistical signifi-
cance in all patients, though in smaller temporal clusters, and
three patients (P3, P4, and P7) showed inspiration-locked in-
creases in the beta range (13–30 Hz).
Respiratory entrainment was also observed in amygdala and
hippocampus, with phase coupling arising near the onset of in-
spiration. In amygdala (Fig. 4B), inspiration-locked oscillatory
power changes were similar to those in PC, with consistent in-
creases in the delta range in all seven patients. Theta oscillations
were less consistently locked to inspiration in this region, with
three of seven patients showing theta power increases (P4, P5,
and P7). In the hippocampus (Fig. 4C), all seven patients exhib-
ited delta power increases following inspiration, though these
effects survived FDR correction in only four patients (P1, P2, P5,
and P7). Significant changes in hippocampal oscillatory power,
again in phase with inspiration, were also found in the theta-
frequency band (P1, P3, P4, P6, and P7) and in the beta-
frequency band (P1, P4, P5, and P7). These findings indicate that
respiratory phase-entrained oscillations in the human brain are
not limited to olfactory-related regions, but extend to adjacent
limbic networks in the medial temporal lobe, especially at low
frequencies.
Human respiratory oscillations depend on nasal airflow
One mechanism by which respiratory phase and limbic cortical
oscillations could become synchronized is that nasal airflow in-
duces oscillatory activity in PC (Fontanini et al., 2003; Fontanini
and Bower, 2005, 2006; Litaudon et al., 2008), which in turn
propagates to amygdala and hippocampus via direct connections
between these brain regions (Carmichael et al., 1994; Yanovsky et
4

Zelano et al. • Human Limbic Respiratory Oscillations
 al., 2014). To test this hypothesis, we reasoned that if nasal airflow
is critical for mediating limbic oscillations, then the diversion of
airflow through the mouth should decrease respiratory entrain-
ment in olfactory limbic areas. We examined iEEG data from
three patients (P5, P6, and P7) who were asked to breathe natu-
rally through either the nose or mouth in separate recording
sessions. The order of nasal and oral breathing was counterbal-
anced across the patients. Electrode coverage for all three patients
included amygdala and hippocampus (only P7 had PC coverage).
Duringoral(vsnasal)breathing,therewasadistinctreductionof
respiratory phase-locked oscillations in PC in the delta, theta, and
beta ranges for each patient (Fig. 5A). The same breathing route-
dependent decline in delta oscillatory activity was also evident in the
amygdala and hippocampus for all three patients (Fig. 5B,C). These
data indicate that the passage of air through the nose is critical for
respiratory entrainment of delta and theta oscillations in PC,
amygdala, and hippocampus. We found that nasal (r � 0.64, p �
0.002),butnotoral(r�0.09,p�0.05)breathingwasalsocriticalfor
respiratory entrainment of the infraslow oscillations in PC (Fig. 6,
top row). By comparison, respiratory entrainment was not signifi-
cant during either nasal or oral breathing in amygdala (nasal breath-
ing, r � 0.28; oral breathing, r � 0.02; p values �0.05) or
hippocampus (nasal breathing, r � 0.33; oral breathing, r � 0.42; p
values �0.05; Fig. 6, middle and bottom rows). While additional
contributions from respiratory pacemakers in the brainstem cannot
be discounted, our findings are compatible with the idea that
respiratory-locked limbic oscillations originate from the cyclic
movement of air through the nose, potentially propagating through
PC en route to downstream targets in the medial temporal lobe.
Recent studies indicate that within-region modulation between
the phase of a low-frequency LFP oscillation and the amplitude of a
higher-frequency LFP oscillation (CFC) is enhanced in the human
brain during high attentional demand, and has been linked to cog-
nitive tasks not only in cortical brain regions (Schack et al., 2002;
Schack and Weiss, 2005; Jensen and Colgin, 2007; Canolty and
Knight,2010;Voyteketal.,2010;Szczepanskietal.,2014),butalsoin
deep limbic structures, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and
nucleus accumbens (Mormann et al., 2005; Tort et al., 2008; Cohen
et al., 2009; Axmacher et al., 2010; Chaieb et al., 2015; Liu et al.,
2015). CFC phenomena have also been observed during rest (Foster
and Parvizi, 2012; Weaver et al., 2016) perhaps reflecting intrinsic
oscillatory signatures among networks that are functionally con-
nected (Foster and Parvizi, 2012). Whether the state of natural
breathing through the nose is associated with phase-amplitude
modulation across a particular frequency range in human olfactory
areas has not been examined.
To this end, we estimated the MI value in PC, amygdala, and
hippocampus for each combination of low-frequency phase (be-
tween 1 and 10 Hz) and higher-frequency amplitude (between 13
and 200 Hz; Tort et al., 2010) in each patient individually (see Ma-
terials and Methods). The resulting comodulograms revealed con-
sistentclustersofCFCacrosspatientsinPC(Fig.7),whiletheresults
were more dispersed and variable across subjects in amygdala and
hippocampus (data not shown). Significant modulation of beta

 power by theta phase was consistently present in PC in all five pa-
tients during nasal breathing (Fig. 7A, white ovals), as well as theta–
gamma coupling in three of five patients (Fig. 7A, white arrows). In
one patient with PC coverage (P7) who took part in the oral breath-
ing task (Fig. 7B), there was a significant decrease in theta—beta
couplingwhenbreathingwasdivertedfromnosetomouth,whichis
in line with the decrease in overall respiratory entrainment of LFP
oscillations shown in Figure 6.
Respiratory phase and route modulate emotional response
times in healthy subjects
Given that our data show markedly different patterns of neural
activity in the amygdala and hippocampus during inhalation
compared with exhalation, it follows that respiratory phase itself
might have a fundamental impact on cognition. To test this hy-
pothesis, we recruited independent groups of healthy subjects to
participate in behavioral tasks typically associated with amygdala
and hippocampal functions (see Materials and Methods). Criti-
cally, in these experiments, sensory stimuli (trials) were pre-
sented at random jittered intervals, enabling us to fully “tile” the
breathing cycle and determine whether behavioral performance
was enhanced when a stimulus arrived within a specific phase of
respiration.
Based on the established role of the amygdala in the processing
of fearful stimuli, we first examined whether the respiratory cycle
modulates response times in an emotion discrimination task.
Twenty-one subjects viewed rapid (100 ms) presentations of
faces expressing either fear or surprise on separate trials, and
made speeded responses to indicate which emotion was per-
ceived (Fig. 8A). Fearful faces were identified more quickly when
they had been encountered during inhalation compared with
exhalation (t(20) � �2.64, p � 0.016, paired t test, two-tailed),
while no such effect was found for surprised faces (t(20) � �0.04,
p � 0.97, paired t test, two-tailed; Fig. 8B). In a separate group of
subjects (N � 17) who breathed through their mouths instead of
their noses, there was no effect on either fearful (t(16) � 1.21, p �
0.24, paired t test, two-tailed) or surprised faces (t(16) � �1.08,
p � 0.30, paired t test, two-tailed), though there was a main effect
of route (such that subjects were overall faster during nasal vs oral
breathing; F(1,36) � 4.87, p � 0.03). Critically, the specificity of
this effect for the fear condition during nasal breathing was ex-
emplified in the following two ways: the three-way interaction
among airflow route (nasal/oral), emotion (fear/surprise), and
respiratory phase (inspiration/expiration) was significant (F(1,36)
� 4.77, p � 0.036), and the two-way interaction between route
(nasal/oral) and respiratory phase (inhale/exhale) for fearful
faces was significant (F(1,36) � 5.83, p � 0.021). The complemen-
tary two-way interaction of route and phase for surprised faces
was not significant (F(1,36) � 1.004, p � 0.323). Together, the
above data establish the nasal origin of these effects.
By plotting time-series profiles of response times across four
phase segments of the breathing cycle (Fig. 8C), we found that
RTs significantly differed across phase time bins for the nasal
route (F(1,20) � 4.98, p � 0.03; repeated-measures ANOVA, main
effect of phase) but not for the oral route (F(1,16) � 1.93, p �
0.18). Importantly, the two-way interaction between route (two
levels: nasal/oral) and phase time bin (four levels) was significant
(F(1,36) � 5.48, p � 0.025). In follow-up post hoc comparisons,

Zelano et al. • Human Limbic Respiratory Oscillations
 when the nasal group was examined separately, maximal RT dif-
ferences across phases were observed between the beginning of
inspiration and the beginning of expiration (Fig. 8C, point 1 vs
point 3; t(20) � �3.0, p � 0.007; two-tailed paired t test). Com-
parison between the nasal and oral groups shows that RTs were
maximally different between the peak of inspiratory flow and the
end of inspiration (point 2 in Fig. 8C; t(36) � �2.47, p � 0.016;
independent sample t test, two-tailed, fear nasal vs oral).
Although the above findings provide strong evidence for the se-
lective effect of nasal breathing (vs oral breathing) on rapid emo-
tional discrimination, it is possible that the oral breathing task could
have introduced an attentional confound: subjects had to focus ex-
plicitlyonkeepingtheirmouthopen,whilesimultaneouslyensuring
that air was not being directed through the nose. In this manner, if
oral breathing had the effect of drawing subjects’ attention away
from the face stimuli, then this might have resulted in slower re-
sponsetimestothosefaces.Therefore,inacontrolbehavioralexper-
iment, we asked an independent group of subjects (N � 24) to
perform the same emotion judgment task, while breathing through
their nose but simultaneously keeping their mouth open. Because
this maneuver poses the same distractions as the pure mouth-
breathing task, we were able to assess whether greater attentional
load (nasal breathing/mouth open) would abolish the RT differ-
ences between fearful and surprise faces.
Our results indicate that despite the imposed distraction, RTs
remained significantly faster when faces were presented during
inhalation compared with exhalation in the fear condition only
(t(23) � �2.88, p � 0.009; data not shown). Importantly, a com-
parison of fear RTs between the two experimental routes (nasal
breathing vs nasal breathing/mouth open) revealed a significant
main effect of breathing phase (F(1,43) � 14.81, p � 0.001), with
no significant interaction between route and phase (F(1,43) �
0.047, p � 0.83). In parallel, when comparing nasal breathing/
mouth open to oral breathing, we found no main effect of phase
(F(1,43) � 0.53, p � 0.47), whereas the interaction between route
and phase was significant (F(1,43) � 6.62, p � 0.014). These find-
ings indicate that, despite the attentional demands of keeping the
mouth open while breathing through the nose, the subject still
responded more quickly to fearful faces during inhalation than
during exhalation, with effects that significantly differed from
oral breathing alone.
Analysis of the accuracy data from the emotion task indicates
that subjects detected the fearful faces equally well during inspi-
ration and expiration, without a significant difference between
respiratory phases (t(20) � �1.71, p � 0.10; data not shown). The
same held true for surprised faces (t(20) � �0.70, p � 0.49).
When comparing nasal and oral routes, a three-way ANOVA
among route, emotion, and phase yielded no significant main
effects (route: F(1,36) � 0.90, p � 0.35; emotion: F(1,36) � 0.25, p �
0.62; phase: F(1,36) � 1.16, p � 0.29), two-way interactions (route
by emotion: F(1,36) � 0.48, p � 0.49; route by phase: F(1,36) � 0.48,
p � 0.492; emotion by phase: F(1,36) � 1.87, p � 0.18), or three-
way interaction (F(1,36) � 0.78, p � 0.38).
Respiratory phase modulates recognition memory accuracy
in healthy subjects
Finally, given the role of the hippocampus in memory function,
independent sets of subjects took part in an object recognition
memory task. Subjects first viewed pictures of visual objects pre-
sented at random time intervals to fully tile the respiratory cycle
(Fig. 9A). After a 20 min break, subjects were presented with the
old pictures plus an equal number of new pictures, again at ran-
dom time intervals. Trials were then sorted according to the re-
spiratory phase in which the pictures had initially been presented,
and also according to the respiratory phase of the picture during
retrieval. In subjects who breathed through the nose (N � 11),
breathing phase exerted an overall significant main effect on rec-
ognition accuracy (F(1,10) � 6.18, p � 0.03; two-way ANOVA),
whereby accuracy was enhanced for the pictures that had been
retrieved during inspiration versus expiration (t(10) � 2.85, p �
0.017, paired t test, two-tailed; Fig. 9B).
Such phase-specific effects on recognition accuracy were not
observed in subjects who breathed orally (N � 11; t(10) � �1.07,
p � 0.31), and there was no main effect of route (nasal vs oral) on
overall accuracy (F(1,20) � 1.15, p � 0.29). Critically, in the two-
way interactions of phase-by-route, inhalation (vs exhalation)
had a significantly stronger impact on memory performance dur-
ing nasal versus oral breathing, both for encoding (F(1,20) � 4.51,
p � 0.046) and retrieval (F(1,20) � 7.06, p � 0.015; Fig. 9B). In
other words, retrieval accuracy was higher for those picture items
that had been encoded during the inspiratory phase of breathing,
and was also higher for picture items retrieved during inspiration,
for the nasal route only.
The above data indicate that, during the encoding session, the
(nasal) respiratory phase had a significant effect on subsequent
memory in the retrieval session, with greater accuracy for pic-
tures encoded during inspiration (vs expiration) and for pictures
retrieved during inspiration (vs expiration). However, this anal-
ysis was averaged across all trials, and was therefore unable to
determine whether memory recognition was selectively en-
hanced when the same pictures were encountered in same (or
different) respiratory phases across encoding and retrieval ses-
sions. For example, one possibility would be that recognition
memory for pictures appearing in the inspiratory phase during
retrieval would be selectively enhanced for those same pictures
that had appeared in the inspiratory phase during encoding.
To explore this question, we conducted a follow-up analysis in
which all “hit” trials (pictures successfully recognized during re-
trieval) were sorted into the following four categories: (1) pic-
tures encoded in inspiration that were retrieved in inspiration;
(2) pictures encoded in expiration that were retrieved in inspira-
tion; (3) pictures encoded in inspiration that were retrieved in
expiration; and (4) pictures encoded in expiration that were re-
trieved in expiration. This arrangement conformed to a 2 � 2
factorial design, with factors of encoding session phase (inspira-
tion/expiration) and retrieval session phase (inspiration/expira-
tion). A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a main
effect of retrieval phase (F(1,10) � 7.00, p � 0.025), but no main
effect of encoding phase (F(1,10) � 0.95, p � 0.35), and no inter-
action between encoding and retrieval phases (F(1,10) � 0.17, p �
0.69). These data indicate that the inspiratory (vs expiratory)
phase of breathing during memory retrieval had a greater impact
on picture recognition, although memory performance did not
depend on whether those same pictures had appeared in the same
or a different respiratory phase at the time of encoding (Fig. 9C).
We also asked an independent group of subjects (N � 11) to
take part in the same memory paradigm while performing the
attention control task (nasal breathing while holding the mouth
open). In comparing the nasal breathing group to the control
(nasal breathing/mouth open) group, there remained a main ef-
fect of phase during retrieval (F(1,20) � 5.48, p � 0.030), without
a main effect of route (F(1,20) � 1.96, p � 0.18), and without an
interaction of phase by route (F(1,20) � 4.0, p � 0.059), suggesting
that attentional demands did not have a marked effect on mem-
ory performance. Analysis of the RT data from the memory task
indicates that breathing phase had no main effect on response

 times during memory retrieval when subjects breathed through
their noses (t(10) � 0.48, p � 0.64), through their mouths (t(10) �
�0.27, p � 0.79), or through their noses while keeping their
mouths open (t(10) � 0.12, p � 0.90).
Amygdala inspiratory power in one patient predicts
performance on an emotion judgment task
To identify a direct relationship between respiratory oscilla-
tory entrainment and cognitive modulation, we obtained in-
tracranial EEG data from one additional patient (P8) with
amygdala coverage who participated in the emotion discrim-
ination task (Fig. 10), on each trial indicating whether the face
was expressing fear or surprise. During this task, the patient
identified fearful faces more quickly during inspiration than
expiration. Although there was no significant difference in
response times for fear versus surprise trials, or for inhalation
versus exhalation trials (all p values �0.14), the interaction
between respiratory phase and emotion was significant, and in
the predicted direction (F(1,128) � 3.446, p � 0.03, one-tailed;
Fig. 10A). In an initial analysis, we simply tested whether re-
spiratory phase had a modulatory effect on LFP oscillatory
activity in the amygdala. The time–frequency spectrogram,
based on an average of all 6 s trials (time locked to peak in-
spiratory flow, as in Fig. 4), revealed oscillatory power in-
creases in the delta-, theta-, and beta-frequency bands (Fig.
10B), in line with the demonstration of low-frequency respi-
ratory entrainment observed in the other seven patients.
To look for a direct relationship between oscillatory power
during inhalation and response times, we conducted a trial-by-
trial analysis of the amygdala LFP data (limited to the 24 trials in
which fearful faces appeared during inhalation). On trials where
the patient identified the face more rapidly, we found that the
inspiratory delta power was generally higher (Fig. 10C). To quan-
tify this effect, trialwise RTs were regressed onto mean inspiratory
power (within the delta band), revealing a significant correlation
between these two measures (Fig. 10D, top left; r � �0.4, p �
0.05). By comparison, such relationships were not observed when
examining mean expiratory power during fear trials (r � 0.15,
p � 0.33), nor during surprise trials for either mean inspiratory
(r � 0.13, p � 0.47) or mean expiratory (r � 0.01, p � 0.95)
power (Fig. 10). Although preliminary, the demonstration of an
inverse relationship between the magnitude of respiratory oscil-
latory entrainment in the amygdala and reaction times on the
emotion task provides an important bridge between the electro-
physiological and behavioral datasets, and brings support to the
idea that respiratory limbic oscillations can shape cognitive
performance.

Zelano et al. • Human Limbic Respiratory Oscillations
 Discussion
Beginning with the groundbreaking work of Lord Adrian almost 75
years ago (Adrian, 1942, 1950), the presence of respiratory oscilla-
tions has become a defining electrophysiological signature of the
olfactory system, yet no published study has demonstrated this phe-
nomenon in humans. By using iEEG techniques to measure oscilla-
tory activity directly from the human brain, we show that electrical
fluctuations in human PC are in phase with the natural cycle of
breathing. This respiratory synchrony extends across both temporal
andspatialscales,withhigher-frequencyoscillatoryentrainmentnot
only in PC, but also in amygdala and hippocampus. Our findings
thus establish that the phasic respiratory organization of electrical
activity in the olfactory system of small mammals is equally applica-
ble to the human olfactory system, despite the fact that humans
breathe at a dramatically slower rate.
Natural breathing paces slow respiratory oscillations in
human piriform cortex
Intriguingly,theslowrateofhumanrespirationapproachestherangeof
“infraslow” oscillations that were first observed in animals �50 years
ago (Aladjalova, 1957). The mechanism by which the brain generates
infraslow electrical fluctuations likely involves multiple intracerebral
structures,withanimalstudiesindicatingself-sustaininginfraslowfluc-
tuations in cortical slices (Sanchez-Vives et al., 2000; Timofeev et al.,
2000), as well as evidence for non-neuronal contributions from glial
cells (Dietzel et al., 1989; Amzica and Steriade, 2000; Heinemann et
al., 2000; Laming et al., 2000) and the blood–brain barrier (Van-
hatalo et al., 2003; Voipio et al., 2003). Speculatively, the large am-
plitude and long duration of infraslow oscillations suggests a likely
contribution from subcortical structures as well (Usher et al., 1999).
In humans, infraslow oscillations have been linked to resting-state
oscillatory networks (Mantini et al., 2007; Picchioni et al., 2011; Hil-
tunen et al., 2014), and studies have also found coherence between
fMRI BOLD signal and respiration in olfactory cortex (Sobel et al.,
1998; Mainland and Sobel, 2006). The data presented here suggest
thepossibilityofanadditionaluniquesourceofinfraslowactivity:air
plumes that periodically enter the nose at the rate of quiet breathing
may elicit slow and rhythmic neuronal oscillations that propagate
throughout limbic brain networks.

Strength of respiratory modulation in the amygdala predicts emotional response times. A, One patient (P8) with intracranial coverage of the amygdala participated in the
emotion discrimination task (as in Fig. 8). Analysis of RTs revealed a significant interaction between emotion (fear vs surprise) and respiratory phase (inhale vs exhale). B, A
time–frequency spectrogram computed across all breaths highlights respiratory entrainment of oscillatory activity in the amygdala, as observed in the patients who took part in the
passive breathing task. Significant spectral clusters (FDR-corrected) are outlined in black, and include delta-, theta-, and beta-frequency bands. Black line, Respiratory waveform; black
horizontal bar, preinspiratory baseline period used for z-normalization. C, In a trial-by-trial analysis of inspiratory delta power, the 24 trials in which fearful faces appeared during the
inspiratory phase of breathing were sorted by increasing RT, and suggest that fear–inhalation trials with higher oscillatory entrainment in amygdala (orange-to-red colors) were
generally associated with faster behavioral responses, compared with trials associated with slower behavioral responses (green-to-blue colors). The respiratory signal for each trial is
overlaid (vertically from top to bottom) in black. D, Trial-by-trial scatterplots of amygdala delta power vs emotion judgment RTs demonstrated a significant negative correlation for
fear–inhalation trials only, whereby trials with greater inspiratory power were associated with lower (faster) RTs. Trialwise measures of amygdala delta power were averaged across the
entire time-window of inhalation or exhalation separately for fear and surprise conditions.

 The inspiratory phase of breathing entrains higher-frequency
oscillations in the human medial temporal lobe including
piriform cortex
We also found that respiratory entrainment of higher-frequency
limbic oscillations was consistent across patients. The inspiratory
phase of nasal breathing was associated with increased power in
the delta frequency range in each of five patients in PC, and seven
patients in amygdala and hippocampus (Fig. 4), with effects sur-
viving statistical correction for multiple comparisons. The
relevance of nasal airflow for respiratory cortical entrainment
was established in separate experiments where three patients
breathed through either the nose or the mouth. Diversion from
nasal to oral breathing led to a disorganization of limbic oscilla-
tory synchrony in all three brain regions. Of note, the emergence
of cross-frequency coupling between theta phase and beta ampli-
tude in PC also dissipated when the breathing route was switched
from nose to mouth (Fig. 7). Mechanistically, such findings im-
ply that variations in low-frequency (delta) power, itself under
the infraslow pace of nasal respiration, serve as a carrier rhythm
on which oscillations at faster frequencies are embedded, or
nested, within the limbic system (Lakatos et al., 2005). More
generally, the demonstration that respiratory phase-locked oscil-
lations—and their coupling to higher-frequency rhythms—are
driven by nasal inhalation suggests that this breathing route
serves as a common “clock” to organize spatiotemporal excitabil-
ity broadly throughout the brain (Kay, 2005; Fontanini and
Bower, 2006; Moore et al., 2013; Ito et al., 2014; Yanovsky et al.,
2014).
Cross-frequency coupling is thought to play an important role
in coordinating neural activity across different spatial and tem-
poral scales, potentially underlying neural information process-
ing and cognition (Bragin et al., 1995; Lisman and Idiart, 1995;
Canolty et al., 2006; Tort et al., 2009; Axmacher et al., 2010;
Canolty and Knight, 2010; Palva et al., 2010; Lisman and Jensen,
2013; Szczepanski et al., 2014; Aru et al., 2015). Maximal modu-
lation has most commonly been reported between theta phase
and gamma amplitude in cortical areas. Interestingly, we found a
different frequency profile for CFC in human olfactory cortex,
namely, theta phase modulating beta (rather than gamma) am-
plitude. Enhanced theta–beta coupling in olfactory cortex was
consistently present in all five subjects with PC coverage, lending
strength to our findings, and dovetailing nicely with data from
rodents suggesting that beta oscillations dominate the LFP during
odor sampling (Neville and Haberly, 2003; Lowry and Kay, 2007;
Martin et al., 2007; Poo and Isaacson, 2009; Kay and Beshel,
2010). Such forms of neurophysiological convergence across dif-
ferent species suggest that human intracranial EEG approaches
may play an important role in helping to inform and constrain
mechanistic principles of olfactory system function in animal
models where causal hypotheses can be more easily addressed.
The respiratory phase of nasal breathing modulates limbic-
based behaviors
A key implication of our data is that the nasal route of respiration
offers an entry point to limbic brain areas for modulating cogni-
tive function. Indeed, behavioral data across three experiments
and 62 participants demonstrated that respiratory phase and
route have a significant influence on emotion discrimination and
recognition memory. Independent groups of healthy subjects
were better able to recognize fearful expressions, and were better
able to retrieve visual object memories, when target stimuli were
encountered during nasal inspiration than during expiration. We
also found that the route of breathing was critical to these effects,
such that cognitive performance significantly declined during
oral breathing. Importantly, the effects of nasal breathing on cog-
nition were sustained even when subjects were asked to hold their
mouth open, helping to control for attentional confounds that
might have arisen during the oral breathing experiment. To-
gether, these findings support the idea that passive inhalation of
air through the nose can selectively enhance reaction times to
fearful stimuli and the accuracy of visual object recognition.
Combined behavioral and electrophysiological data from one
patient show that respiratory entrainment of LFP activity in the
amygdala is predictive of performance on an emotion discrimi-
nation task. In linking trial-by-trial changes in respiratory oscil-
lations to behavior, these results bring insights into the potential
mechanisms by which breathing can influence human cognitive
processing. That rhythmic breathing paces electrical activity in
the human brain to modulate behavior raises the intriguing pos-
sibility that other physiological and autonomic rhythms, and
even periodic sampling in other sensory domains (Kepecs et al.,
2006; Moore et al., 2013; Ito et al., 2014), might also shape neu-
ronal oscillations to optimize human perception, emotion, and
cognition. We would note that, while the effect sizes of our be-
havioral results are relatively modest (e.g., a 28 ms difference
between fear inhalation and fear exhalation for the nasal route; a
60 ms difference between fear inhalation/exhalation for the nasal
vs oral route), the magnitude of the changes is on par with those
found in many other cognitive studies examining the effects of
facial emotion on perceptual discrimination, with differences
typically in the range of 20–100 ms (Doty et al., 2014; Li et al.,
2014; Ye et al., 2014).
While our iEEG data provide direct evidence for respira-
tory phase-specific entrainment in the human brain, the use of
iEEG methods has inherent shortcomings. Limited availability
of epilepsy research patients for these studies means that sam-
ple sizes tend to be low. Because medication regimen, postim-
plantation hospital course, and regional locations of the
electrodes are just a few of the many factors that may differ
across patients, data variability across patients can be high. To
minimize these issues, and to prevent outlier bias effects, we
conducted and presented all analyses at the level of individual
patients, and highlighted common electrophysiological pro-
files across patients. In the context of our study, attentional
fluctuations, breathing differences, and temporal jitter (asso-
ciated with event-related spectral analyses) are additional po-
tential sources of variability that might have emerged both
within and between patients. Nevertheless, the fact that our
effects were generally consistent across patients, and survived
statistical correction for multiple comparisons, suggests that
this variance did not have a major detrimental impact and
would only have reduced the strength of our findings.
In demonstrating respiratory modulation of cognition, our
data provide a novel counterpoint to earlier studies reporting
cognitive (behavioral) modulation of respiration. Animals
routinely increase their respiratory rate during exploratory
behavior (Welker, 1964; Kay and Freeman, 1998; Verhagen et
al., 2007; Evans et al., 2009; Vlemincx et al., 2011; Huijbers et
al., 2014), and humans alter their respiratory patterns in re-
sponse to emotional stimuli (Boiten, 1998) and cognitive ef-
fort (Evans et al., 2009; Vlemincx et al., 2011; Huijbers et al.,
2014). For example, the human respiratory cycle phase locks
to stimulus presentations during memory encoding (Huijbers
et al., 2014), and respiratory variability is reduced during
mental load and attentional tasks (Vlemincx et al., 2011). Such
studies suggest that respiratory patterns are impacted by cog-

 nition, but do not address the possibility that the respiratory
rhythm directly impacts neural activity in the brain in a func-
tionally relevant manner. Our findings imply that, rather than
being a passive target of heightened arousal or vigilance, the
phase of natural breathing is actively used to promote oscilla-
tory synchrony and to optimize information processing in
brain areas mediating goal-directed behaviors.
