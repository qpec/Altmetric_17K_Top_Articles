Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of food environments, characterized as food swamps,
on adult obesity rates.
Food swamps have been described as areas with a high-density of
establishments selling high-calorie fast food and junk food, relative to healthier food options.
This study examines multiple ways of categorizing food environments as food swamps and food
deserts, including alternate versions of the Retail Food Environment Index. We merged food outlet,
sociodemographic and obesity data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Food Environment Atlas, the American Community Survey, and a commercial street reference
dataset. We employed an instrumental variables (IV) strategy to correct for the endogeneity of food
environments (i.e., that individuals self-select into neighborhoods and may consider food availability
in their decision). Our results suggest that the presence of a food swamp is a stronger predictor
of obesity rates than the absence of full-service grocery stores. We found, even after controlling
for food desert effects, food swamps have a positive, statistically significant effect on adult obesity
rates. All three food swamp measures indicated the same positive association, but reflected different
magnitudes of the food swamp effect on rates of adult obesity (p values ranged from 0.00 to 0.16).
Our adjustment for reverse causality, using an IV approach, revealed a stronger effect of food swamps
than would have been obtained by naïve ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. The food swamp
effect was stronger in counties with greater income inequality (p < 0.05) and where residents are
less mobile (p < 0.01). Based on these findings, local government policies such as zoning laws
simultaneously restricting access to unhealthy food outlets and incentivizing healthy food retailers to
locate in underserved neighborhoods warrant consideration as strategies to increase health equity.

1. Introduction
The nation is experiencing an obesity epidemic, with 35% of all adults classified as having
obesity [1]. However, disparities exist and obesity rates are higher in low-income populations
and racial and ethnic minority groups than in socially-advantaged populations [2]. There are also
inequalities in obesity rates by geographic region, which has serious implications for exacerbating
health disparities [3,4]. The relationship between where people live and their risk of obesity has led to
research on the relationship between one’s food environment and health.
1.1. Food Deserts and Food Swamps
“Food deserts”, defined as residential areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious
food, [5] have been posited as one driver of the obesity epidemic [6]. Living in a food desert has been

linked to a poor diet [7] and greater risk of obesity [8,9]; while people who live near a grocery store are
more likely to consume fruits and vegetables and less likely to be obese [6,10].
Food deserts are often assessed by measuring the distance between people’s homes and
supermarkets [5,11], which has been found to vary significantly with a neighborhood’s racial/ethnic
and socioeconomic composition [12–14]. To address the problem of food deserts, the Healthy Food
Financing Initiative supports opening full-service grocery stores where none exist [15]. Surprisingly,
quasi-experimental and longitudinal studies evaluating the impact of opening new grocery stores
have shown that while perceived access to healthy food improves, diet quality and body mass index
(BMI) do not [15–18]. These findings suggest that the influence of introducing healthier foods into a
neighborhood may be tempered by the continued accessibility of unhealthy foods.
To capture the idea that both healthy and unhealthy food access is important, Rose and colleagues
coined the term “food swamp” as a spatial metaphor to describe neighborhoods where fast food and
junk food inundate healthy alternatives [19]. Low-income and racial-ethnic minorities are more likely
than Whites to live near unhealthy food retailers, which has been associated with poor diet [20–23].
In a review of the research on fast food access, 10 out of 12 studies provided evidence that fast food
restaurants are more likely to locate in areas where there are higher concentrations of ethnic minorities
than Whites [24]. These associations raise questions about causality and suggest that the race and
ethnicity of a community shapes the actions of the food industry and community design decision
makers, which in turn, influence the food environment.
Alternatively, reverse causality may occur at the individual behavior level.
Observational
studies tend to assume that the food environment shapes individual health behaviors and health
outcomes, but not vice versa. However, individuals may self-select into neighborhoods, and it is
important that studies on neighborhood food environments and obesity account for this endogeneity
problem [5,25–33]. Because it is not feasible to assign people to neighborhoods in an experimental
design, statistical adjustments are necessary.
In summary, there is evidence that living in a food desert increases the risk of obesity. There is also
emerging evidence that food swamps may better capture the characteristics of an obesogenic
neighborhood food environment. The research to date on food swamps highlights two substantial
gaps in knowledge: how to operationalize the food swamp concept for empirical analysis; and how to
adjust for the possibility that obese adults choose to live in neighborhoods that are food swamps.
1.2. Study Objectives
To our knowledge, this is the first study to test relative measures of food swamps alongside food
deserts as predictors of obesity rates across all United States (U.S.) counties, adjusting for reverse
causality. We have three key objectives.
First, the present study makes a novel contribution by examining the countrywide existence of
“food swamps” in the U.S. This builds upon previous work on food swamps abroad [33,34] and studies
identifying food swamps in two major U.S. cities [21,35]. For instance, Hager and colleagues identified
food swamps as areas in Baltimore City, with four or more convenience/corner stores within 0.25 miles
of a study participant’s home.
Second, this study contributes to the literature on food swamps in the U.S. by considering the
relative balance among multiple food outlets in the environment rather than absolute metrics of grocery
store or restaurant access [36–38]. We examined multiple ways of categorizing food environments as
food swamps, including alternate versions of the Retail Food Environment Index (RFEI) [23,34,39].
This builds upon previous work by Colón-Ramos and colleagues, which employed a relative food
environment measure to identify a food swamp in the District of Columbia and predict food acquisition
behaviors among recently migrated mothers from Central America [35]. The other studies that have
used relative measures of food access were conducted outside the US, in Waterloo, Canada [33]
and Porirua, New Zealand [34].

Third, this paper addresses the question of reverse causality, which is relevant because both
individuals and the builders of food outlets choose to go into certain neighborhoods. Different
statistical methods have been utilized to account for unobserved characteristics that may influence
where individuals and food retailers choose to locate [5,26–33,40]. An increasingly common approach
is to instrument for food store access with highways (counts within, or distance from, a predetermined
geographic area), street connectivity or land zoned for commercial use [26–29].
To substantiate the use of highway exits as an instrument for restaurant access, previous papers
have referenced the clustering of fast food retailers near highways, independent of demand or
health outcomes [26–29,41]. With the exception of work by Dunn and colleagues using a nationally
representative dataset, these studies have been limited to rural areas [26]. We expand upon this work
by accounting for fast food retail options beyond the largest national brands and controlling for food
deserts. We also include a measure of the conduciveness to physical activity to address the critical role
of physical activity as a correlate of obesity [26].
Last, we offer an aggregated unit of analysis to facilitate policy discussions. We test the effect of
food access on obesity rates by using a county-level unit of analysis [26]. This approach complements
the current literature as it is more aggregated than the local community level [27–31,34,35,39],
but less aggregated than the state level [32,42].
Previous work by Dunn [26] and Blanchard
and Lyson [43] documents significant county-level variations in access to fast food restaurants or
grocery stores. Land-use and zoning policies are usually implemented at the county and city-level;
therefore, our county-level assessment of this topic can potentially inform an identification strategy
for municipalities that would most benefit from revising zoning policies related to the local food
environment [44].
The key hypotheses were that: (1) food swamps are a distinct and separate phenomenon to
food deserts; and (2) food swamps have a stronger positive effect on obesity rates than food deserts,
even after controlling for physical activity indicators and sociodemographic information.
2. Data and Empirical Strategy
We employed an instrumental variables (IV) strategy to correct for the endogeneity problems
associated with food environments and utilized highway exits as a source of exogenous variation.
Using cross-sectional, secondary food retail and obesity rates data from the USDA Food Environment
Atlas, ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression models were
employed to analyze cross-sectional associations between local food environments categorized as food
swamps and obesity rates.
2.1. Data
This paper used 2009 data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food
Environment Atlas [45]. This dataset includes 211 food environment indicators for all 3141 US counties.
The Food Environment Atlas is a compilation of federal government sources and includes statistics
on (1) food stores (total counts per county based on the North American Industry Classification
System (NAICS); (2) health and well-being (% of adult county residents); and (3) community
characteristics. Matching with county-level Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) codes,
Food Environment Atlas data were combined with data from the ArcGIS ESRI StreetMap North
America, on the number of highway exits per county as well as socio-demographic information from
the American Community Survey.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Dependent Variable: Adult Obesity Rates
The primary outcome measure was the rate of adult obesity at the county level, taken from the
Food Environment Atlas, measured as the age-adjusted percentage of persons, aged 20 and older,
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 1366
4 of 20
who are obese. People are considered obese if they have a body mass index (BMI) greater than
or equal to 30 kilograms per meter squared. BMI remains a respected screening tool for obesity,
despite its limitations [46]. The original data source for this variable was the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Systems (BRFSS). CDC BRFSS
calculates aggregate levels of BMI by asking more than 500,000 respondents nationwide the following
questions: How tall are you without shoes? and About how much do you weigh without shoes?
2.2.2. Independent Variable: Food Swamps
Table 1 presents the three continuous food swamp measures we used, which were based on
previous studies utilizing relative food environment measures [23,30,33,34,39,47]. All county-level
food store data was sourced from the Food Environment Atlas. We began with the traditional Retail
Food Environment Index (RFEI), which is calculated as the ratio of fast food retailers and convenience
stores to grocery stores and supermarkets [23,39]. The RFEI measure considers fast food restaurants,
full-service restaurants, and convenience stores as unhealthy food outlets and supermarkets, grocery
stores and farmers’ markets as healthy food outlets.
Table 1. Food Swamp Measures.
Food Swamp Measure

Grocery Stores/Supermarkets + Farmer� s Markets + Specialized stores
Expanded RFEI #2
Fast Food/Limited Service Establishments + Convenience Stores
Grocery Stores/Supermarkets + Farmer� s Markets + Specialized stores + Supercenters
We also constructed two forms of “Expanded RFEI” to include additional food outlets.
These additional outlets were categorized as healthy if they traditionally offered healthy foods,
as defined in Table 2 [48]. Based on this definition, supermarkets, specialty stores (e.g., produce markets,
delis), and permanent farmers markets were all classified as healthy outlets. Conversely, limited service
establishments (which include take-out or self-carry to a table) and corner stores, and convenience
stores were considered unhealthy outlets. Supercenters, such as Wal-Mart, were difficult to categorize
because studies have found both positive and negative relationships between additional Wal-Mart
locations and average BMI [49,50]. To address this empirically, we put superstores in the numerator
(unhealthy) in RFEI #1 and the denominator (healthy) in RFEI #2.
Table 2. Definitions of Healthy vs. Unhealthy Food Items [48].
Food Type
Definition
Healthy food
Foods that (a) are comprised of at least one of the major food groups (vegetables, fruits,
grains, dairy, and protein foods) equal to at least half the portion size that the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans 2010 uses for measuring the nutrients in that food, and (b) contain
only moderate amounts of saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium.
Less healthy/
Unhealthy food
Foods that are high in saturated fat, added sugar, and/or sodium, or that contribute little
to meeting dietary recommendations.
2.3. Covariates
2.3.1. Food Deserts
Food deserts were calculated as a continuous measure reflecting the proportion of each county’s
total population identified as both low income and low access. Low income was defined as having a
household income ≤ 200% of the federal poverty threshold and low access was defined as being more
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 1366
5 of 20
than 1 mile from a supermarket/grocery store in an urban area, or more than 10 miles in a rural area.
The data for these calculations were obtained from the Food Environment Atlas.
2.3.2. Recreation/Fitness Facilities & Natural Amenities
Ecological models of obesity illustrate energy balance as a function of factors shaping “energy in”
(determined by the food environment), but also “energy out” (determined by the calories expended
during physical activity). The Food Environment Atlas includes the number of recreation and fitness
facilities that feature exercise, physical fitness and recreational sports unadjusted for county size
(NAICS code: 713940). The original dataset for this variable was the U.S. Census Bureau County
Business Patterns.
The Food Environment Atlas also provides a Natural Amenities Index for each county, originally
from the Economic Research Service Natural Amenities Scale.
The index is measured from
1 (low amenity) to 6 (high amenity) and is based on the premise that people are more inclined to be
active where there are lakes, ponds or ocean fronts, warmer winters and summers with low-humidity.
2.3.3. Socio-Demographic Characteristics
Matching on county-level FIPS codes, we merged data from the Food Environment Atlas
(median household income, poverty rate, metropolitan vs. nonmetropolitan status and low-fat milk:
soda price ratio) with data from the 2010 U.S. Census and the American Community Survey to obtain
more information pertaining to neighborhoods characteristics. The low-fat milk price: soda price ratio
variable was extracted from the Food Environment Atlas as a proxy for the relative affordability of
healthier food products. More specifically, this measure is a ratio of the regional average price of 1%
and nonfat milk to the regional average price of diet and caloric sweetened beverages. Variables taken
from the Census included: population, number of households, race (% white, % Black and % Hispanic),
gender (female), age groups (in four-year intervals) and size (in square miles).
Additional descriptive information about the counties, including educational attainment, means
of travel to work (car, public transportation, etc.) and level of income equality (measured by the Gini
Coefficient), was added from the American Community Survey. Previous evidence suggests that
inequality is an important factor to consider in the context of obesogenic environments and health
disparities [51]. The Gini Index reflects the distribution of income on a scale of 0 (perfect equality)
to 1 (perfect inequality) [52]. Primary means of travel to work was included because transportation
and vehicle ownership have been previously linked to food access [5]. All of these socio-demographic
variables were measured at the county level, except for the low-fat milk: soda price ratio, which used
regional prices.
2.4. Statistical Approach
Statistical analyses were executed using STATA/SE version 14 software (StataCorp,
College Station, TX, USA). Initial descriptive statistics were calculated for the sample of 3141 US
counties. Mean values were compared for the Food Store variables, the Food Environment Measures
and key demographics, such as race, median household income, age, means of transport to work
and Gini Index. The second phase of this study involved bivariate analyses. Pearson’s correlation
coefficients were used to assess the relationships between obesity rates, highway exits, and food
swamp measures. Correlational analyses were used to examine the association between the food
swamp and food desert variables, and test the hypothesis that food swamps are operationally distinct
from food deserts.
2.4.1. OLS Regression Analysis: Testing Obesity as a Function of Food Swamps and Food Deserts
In phase three of the analyses, multivariate analyses were used to model county-level obesity
rates as a function of the food swamp effect, the food desert effect, the number of recreation and
physical fitness centers, and the Natural Amenities Index, while controlling for several neighborhood

characteristics. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models were run to test the significance of
these predictors. Each socio-demographic variable was added to the model only if its variance inflation
factor (VIF) was about 2 or under. The model employed (Equation (1)) built upon one used by Chen and
colleagues by incorporating food stores beyond fast food restaurants and grocery stores, and explicitly
controlling for physical activity indicators in the aggregate (rather than at the individual) level [29].
County Obesity rate = β0 + β1 (food swamp) + β2 (food desert) + β3(# of recreation and
physical fitness centers) + β4 (natural amenities) + γ (neighborhood characteristics) + �
(1)
Each regression model was tested using three alternative food swamp measures. These were:
(1) Traditional RFEI (2) Expanded RFEI with supercenters categorized as “healthy” and (3) Expanded
RFEI 2 with supercenters categorized as “unhealthy”.
2.4.2. Instrumental Variable Approach: Two-Staged Least Squared (2SLS) Regression Analyses
For the fourth phase of analysis, a quasi-experimental method was used to correct for reverse
causality. One possibility is that unhealthy food outlets are built in neighborhoods where individuals
already have expressed preferences for fast food and junk food, or are more likely to be obese.
Therefore, to derive a consistent estimate of the effect of food swamps on obesity rates, we must
be convinced that they are independent of residuals. To accomplish this, we used a two-stage least
squares (2SLS) estimator for IV regression. The term “2SLS” stems from this estimator being calculated
in two stages. The first stage regression is conducted using OLS and includes only exogenous variables
on the right-hand side. The second stage involves utilizing OLS to estimate the structural regression,
with endogenous variables replaced by predictors from the first stage. Rummo and colleagues
employed comparable IV regression models to examine the relationship between food environments
and body mass index [30].
Notably, the 2SLS IV approach requires that two conditions are met: (1) The chosen instrument is
related to the potentially endogenous question predictor (X); and (2) There is no direct path from the
instrument (Z) to the outcome (Y), except through predictor (X), known as the exclusion restriction.
The 2SLS IV approach employed in this study is illustrated by the results of two separate
regressions (first and second stage). As shown in Equation (2), the first stage reflects Z (highway exits)
as a valid predictor of food swamps (X). The second stage exhibits the predicted values of X (which were
the output of the first stage) inserted into the model of county obesity rates (Y) (Equation (2)).
We conducted a comparative analysis by running separate regression models, including only one of
the three continuous food swamp measures. The “ivregress” command in Stata (version 15.0) was used
for this phase of the analysis.

2.4.3. Stratification: Means of Travel to Work and Income Inequality
The final phase of the analysis involved stratification using the same models in Equations (1)–(3).
As an attempt to isolate the food swamp effect on obesity rates from other county characteristics,
counties included in the sampling frame were stratified by means of travel to work, and income
equality.
This permitted examination of the effect of food swamps on obesity rates, based on

comparisons between more homogenous counties, while simultaneously addressing the potential
threats to exclusion outlined above.

3.2. Bivariate Analysis
As Table 5 indicates, the relationship between food deserts and food swamps at the county level
varied by the measure of food swamps used. Overall, this measure showed a statistically significant
negative correlation between food deserts and food swamps. In addition, all of the coefficients
reported in Table 5 were considered small, suggesting these two phenomena are distinctly different
(see Appendix A, Table A2, for OLS estimates of food deserts on food swamps controlling for key
socio-demographics). We found similar trends by testing the food desert measure (% low access and
low income) as a predictor of all five food swamp variables, controlling for aggregate measures of
educational attainment, race, ethnicity, poverty, and square miles

Results from the correlation analyses showed the food desert variable was not statistically
significantly associated with obesity. In contrast, the food swamp measures were significantly positively
correlated with the number of highway exits in a county. Surprisingly, the traditional RFEI was
significantly negatively associated with the number of highway exits in a county. Finally, highway
exits were significantly correlated with fitness centers. Physical activity indicators represent potential
threats to the exclusion restriction, and thus were incorporated in the regression analyses (refer to
Appendix A, Table A3, for correlations between obesity and highway exits and a range of food
environment measures, physical activity indicators, and county demographics).
3.3. OLS Regression Results
All specifications included for the multivariate analysis used robust standard errors clustered
by state (Table 6). The food swamp measures showed a statistically positive effect on obesity rates,
controlling for food deserts, fitness/recreation centers, natural amenities, low-fat milk price: soda price
ratio, county size in square miles and several sociodemographic indicators.
Across specifications (1–3) none of the continuous food desert measures remained statistically
significant after controlling for food swamps. The magnitude of the food swamp effect on obesity
varied across the three measures. However, the coefficients were small; the highest was the traditional
RFEI variable, which indicated that a 1 percent increase in fast food restaurants increases obesity by
approximately 0.125 percent. Here, the version of the expanded RFEI 1 with supercenters categorized
as healthy had a larger magnitude than the expanded RFEI 2. However, neither had a stronger effect
on obesity than the traditional RFEI. We also conducted the OLS regression analyses adding total food
outlets as a covariate and there were no major changes in the findings (see Appendix A, Table A4,
for the full table of regression results including total food stores as a neighborhood characteristic).

3.4. Instrument Variables (IV) Regression Results
In order to address the problem of food swamp endogeneity, we employed an IV strategy using
the number of highway exits per county as a source of exogenous variation. The first and second
stage results from the two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression analyses are shown in Tables 7 and 8,
respectively. The 2SLS models controlled for the same variables as the OLS regressions. Results from
the first stage (Table 7) indicated that while highway exits were significantly associated with the food
swamp measures, the size of the effect was small.

All food swamp measures indicated a positive effect on county-level obesity rates after controlling
for food deserts, physical activity, and key demographics (Table 8). For instance, βTraditionalRFEI was
2.604. Notably, using highway exits as an instrument, the food swamp effect on obesity was stronger
compared to the OLS coefficients shown in Table 6. We also conducted these analyses controlling for
total food outlets as a covariate in all models, and the food swamp measures still showed a positive
relationship with obesity relevance. See the Appendix A Table A5 for the full table of IV results
controlling for additional neighborhood characteristics and key demographics.
In the final analyses, the 2SLS model using the traditional RFEI was stratified by income inequality
and means of transportation to work. As shown in Table 9, the food swamp effect remained significant
among counties where there was less driving or reliance on public transportation for travelling to work
(βRFEI = 2.452; p < 0.05). The first specification in Table 9 suggests food swamps are a stronger predictor
of obesity in these geographic areas relative to the impact of food deserts (βLowincome&LowAccess = 0.09;
p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant food swamp or food desert effects in counties with
above average driving or use of public transportation. Further, the food swamp effect on obesity
remained statistically significant in areas with lower income inequality (p < 0.05).

4. Discussion
This study documents that food swamps are a stronger predictor than food deserts on obesity
rates among U.S. adults at the county level. Our results suggest that it is important to use relative
food environment measures that incorporate both “healthy” and “unhealthy” retail sources of food.
Our work expands the findings of a study conducted in California which showed a positive association
between RFEI and obesity rates [23]. Our findings are also consistent with a previous longitudinal
study of individuals’ accesses to grocery stores and fast food outlets which found evidence to support
a 3 km zoning restriction on fast food establishments from low-income residents [40]. In that study,
the authors concluded that increased access to grocery stores should be pursued in combination with
other strategies, because improving access to grocery stores did not improve diet quality. The present
study also demonstrates the value of addressing the potential problem of endogeneity when measuring
the causal effect of food access on diet-related health outcomes. The current results demonstrate that
typical OLS regression analyses would have underestimated both the food swamp and food desert
effects on obesity rates.
4.1. Food Swamps vs. Food Deserts
The results of this study support the position that food swamps are a separate phenomenon
from food deserts, and may play an even larger role than food deserts on county-level obesity rates.
Results from OLS regressions showed that food desert measures became statistically insignificant after
controlling for food swamps. In contrast, IV results indicated that food deserts have a significant
positive effect on obesity. However, the food desert effect was much smaller than the food swamp
effect on obesity after adjusting for sorting effects.

4.2. Food Swamp Measures
Overall, all the food swamp measures were significantly related to rates of adult obesity at the
county level; however, the comparative analysis revealed variation in the magnitude of this effect
across food swamp measures. We tested the traditional RFEI index and two expanded versions of
the RFEI index and found that the traditional RFEI had the strongest relationship with rates of adult
obesity out of the three measures, in both OLS and IV regression analyses. This suggests that the
balance among fast food restaurants, convenience stores, and grocery stores is a more important
determinant of aggregate obesity levels than other food outlets, including supercenters, farmers’
markets or specialized food stores.
4.3. OLS vs. IV
The present study also demonstrates the value of addressing the potential problem of endogeneity
when measuring the causal effect of food access on diet-related health outcomes. Our results are
consistent with previous studies showing that OLS regression models underestimate the effect of
food environments on obesity rates [26–28,30–32]. Estimates from simple OLS regressions were
downwardly biased and would have underestimated the food swamp effect without the highway exit
instrument because they do not adjust for endogeneity. The naïve OLS estimate coefficients suggest
that mitigating food swamp effects would only lower obesity rates by about 0.003 to 0.12 percent.
In contrast, the IV coefficient estimates imply that policies, like zoning laws, could lower obesity
rates by about three percent. These results are consistent with the notion that the built environment
shapes health, even after controlling for selection and individuals’ preferences to live in certain
neighborhoods [26–28,30–32,38,41,53,54].
4.4. Neighborhoods Characteristics
The positive food swamp effect on obesity rates was stronger in counties where people were less
likely to drive or use public transportation to get to work. This finding suggests that individuals who
have limited access to their own or public transportation may be more vulnerable to the negative
impact of living in a food swamp. Zoning policies addressing food swamps might be prioritized
in counties where people are restricted to walkable and bikeable distances when acquiring food
(e.g., corner stores or fast-food restaurants near major roads).
In regard to the relative importance of transportation in food deserts, we found that in areas
where the population was less mobile, living in a food swamp was more closely associated with rates
of obesity. This result is consistent with the idea that grocery shopping decisions are less convenience
driven than food purchasing at unhealthy food retailers. Thus, it is reasonable that food swamps are
a stronger predictor in counties with comparable primary means of transportation, because people
may consider proximity to fast food outlets and convenience stores to lower time costs associated with
acquiring food. Notably, stratifying by income inequality did not diminish the food swamp effect,
suggesting that this phenomenon is consistent in the built environment across socio-economically
diverse counties.
4.5. Limitations
The present study has limitations.
First, as noted by Dunn, highways are an imperfect
instrument [26]. There were 1672 counties with no highway exits, so this IV approach did not
provide information about counties where the food environment is not associated with the number
of highway exits. Further, we might imagine several scenarios where the density of highway exits
influences obesity rates through mechanisms other than “food swamp” environments. There are a few
plausible threats to the exclusion restrictions necessary for implementing an IV approach. Gas stations
selling snacks, quick meals and other high-calorie, convenience foods were not accounted for in the
current study, but they also cluster near highways. Also, more highways may decrease the appeal of
 Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2017, 14, 1366
13 of 20
physical activity (i.e., walking or biking) due to more traffic congestion or pollution. We attempted to
adjust for a potentially weak instrument [26–28] by controlling for physical activity indicators, median
household income and race (threats 2 and 3). However, the physical activity indicators were measures
of access and conduciveness to physical activity, not information about how frequently people exercise
each week.
Second, due to data limitations, this study did not examine mechanisms linking food
environments to obesity.
It would be useful for future work on food swamps to consider
diet quality, food away from home expenditures, and exposure to food marketing as potential
pathways. Third, this study was limited to the county level data available, so it did not assess
the impact of micro-level food environments by using census tract, neighborhood-level assessments,
or individual-level BMI data. The cross-sectional nature of the dataset limited our ability to make
causal statements, and the obesity rates were based on self-reported height and weight, rather than
measured height and weight. Finally, there are validity issues with secondary data sources, including
the Food Environment Atlas, which categorizes food stores based on NAICS codes [55].
5. Conclusions
5.1. Implications for Future Research on Zoning to Reduce Food Swamps
The findings from the current study have implications for zoning policies to reduce the harm
associated with food swamps. Future research is needed to: (1) identify and refine the types of
zoning policies recommended (e.g., restrictions on locations of fast food restaurants, closing times,
distances from public places); (2) define terms such as “fast-food restaurant”, “formula restaurant”,
and “carryout” to avoid enforcement challenges; (3) identify priority locations that meet the definition
of food deserts or food swamps for zoning interventions; and (4) study how to mobilize community
members and leaders.
Standardized measures of food swamps and fast food restaurants, in the context of health zoning
policies, should be priority aims in future research on this topic. Fleischhacker and colleagues reported
that twenty out of forty articles had their own way of defining a fast food retailer [55]. It is problematic
that the Los Angeles City Council passed a moratorium on issuing licenses for the construction of new
fast food restaurants without a sound definition of what constitutes a fast food restaurant [56].
5.2. Implications for Zoning as an Obesity Prevention Strategy
Scholars argue that policies limiting the availability or affordability of unhealthy foods may have
more impact on obesity than those designed to promote access to healthy food options [14,57,58].
Given limited resources for policy interventions, it is important to identify which strategies are likely
to have the greatest impact. However, the systems approach to obesity prevention has revealed that
restricting unhealthy food items without introducing alternative healthy food stores potentially leads
to higher rates of food insecurity in these communities [2].
The Institute of Medicine suggests that we identify ways to attract retailers offering healthier
foods to underserved communities, while also limiting the concentration of unhealthy food venues.
Incentives should be linked to public health goals in ways that give priority to stores that also commit
to health-promoting retail strategies (e.g., through placement, promotion, and pricing) [2].
Results from the present study on food swamps can be used by key stakeholders, such as city
planners and policymakers, to justify a two pronged approach to improving the food environment.
Interventions like the Healthy Food Financing Initiative bring grocery stores to food deserts can be
complemented with restrictions on fast-food restaurants and convenience stores. By simultaneously
increasing availability of healthy food and decreasing availability of unhealthy food, policymakers can
maximize the potential of the food environment to reduce obesity and promote health equity.
