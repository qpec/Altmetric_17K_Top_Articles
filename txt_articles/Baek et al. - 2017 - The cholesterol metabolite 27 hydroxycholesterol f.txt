Obesity and elevated circulating cholesterol are risk factors for breast cancer recurrence,
while the use of statins, cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors widely used for treating
hypercholesterolemia, is associated with improved disease-free survival. Here, we show
that cholesterol mediates the metastatic effects of a high-fat diet via its oxysterol metabolite,
27-hydroxycholesterol. Ablation or inhibition of CYP27A1, the enzyme responsible for the
rate-limiting step in 27-hydroxycholesterol biosynthesis, significantly reduces metastasis in
relevant animal models of cancer. The robust effects of 27-hydroxycholesterol on metastasis
requires myeloid immune cell function, and it was found that this oxysterol increases
the number of polymorphonuclear-neutrophils and γδ-T cells at distal metastatic sites.
The pro-metastatic actions of 27-hydroxycholesterol requires both polymorphonuclear-
neutrophils and γδ-T cells, and 27-hydroxycholesterol treatment results in a decreased
number of cytotoxic CD8+T lymphocytes. Therefore, through its actions on γδ-T cells
and polymorphonuclear-neutrophils, 27-hydroxycholesterol functions as a biochemical
mediator of the metastatic effects of hypercholesterolemia.

besity is an established risk factor for the onset of breast
cancer, and in patients with established disease, it is
associated with a decreased time to recurrence and
poorer overall survival1, 2. The significance of the association
between obesity and metastatic recurrence is highlighted by the
fact that >90% of breast cancer mortality is attributable to
metastasis. However, the multifactorial nature of obesity has
made it difficult to establish cause and effect relationships with
respect to breast cancer pathophysiology. Proposed mechanisms
include obesity-associated increases in circulating levels of
insulin, insulin like growth factor 1 or inflammatory cytokines/
adipokines released from adipose-infiltrating immune cells or
adipose itself3. For estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive breast
cancer, the local production of estrogens (17-β estradiol or
estrone) by aromatase expressed in adipose tissue is likely to be a
contributing factor. Elevated cholesterol is a comorbidity of
obesity4–6, generating the postulate that cholesterol may mediate
some of the pro-metastatic effects of obesity. Epidemiologic
data
regarding
cholesterol
and
breast
cancer
onset
are
controversial, and it is not clear whether total, LDL or HDL
cholesterol impart risk7–9. Studies investigating the correlation
between patients taking inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A reductase, statins and risk of onset are equally
conflicting, with the largest meta-analyses indicating that there
is no association10. However, there is strong clinical evidence
supporting a role for cholesterol in breast cancer recurrence and
survival. Elevated total cholesterol is associated with increased
breast cancer recurrence11. Further, several retrospective studies
indicate patients taking statins, demonstrate a significantly
increased time to breast cancer recurrence12–14. Finally, in a
recently
published
phase
III,
double-blind
trial
including
8010
postmenopausal
women
with
early-stage,
hormone
receptor-positive invasive breast cancer, it was found that taking
cholesterol lowering medication during endocrine therapy was
associated with increased recurrence-free survival time and
distant recurrence–free interval15. Considering these observa-
tions, we hypothesized that cholesterol is a mediator of some of
the effects of obesity on breast cancer metastasis.
Previously we have shown that a high-cholesterol diet
can increase the growth of ER-positive tumors in the murine
MMTV-PyMT model, and that statin treatment could attenuate
the effects of a high-fat diet on E0771 tumor growth16.
Notable was the observation that the primary metabolite of
cholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), behaved as a selective

Fig. 1 27HC is a biochemical mediator of the effects of obesity and elevated cholesterol on breast cancer metastasis. a A high-cholesterol diet (HCD)
increases spontaneous metastasis of murine ER-negative Met1 cells (N = 10 each). b Mice fed a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) exhibit increased lung

APOE3 mice (i.v. graft of cells). Pretreatment for 7 days prior to the graft and continued treatment throughout the study with daily placebo or atorvastatin
(statin, 40 mg/kg) by oral gavage reduced metastatic colonization. Representative images of iRFP-expressing E0771 colonies (depicted as black) within the

 estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that exhibited agonist
activity in breast cancer cells and as such was able to promote the
growth of ER-positive tumors16, 17. Importantly, 27HC levels
have been found to be elevated within breast tumors compared to
normal breast tissue, increased protein expression of the enzyme
responsible for its synthesis (CYP27A1) is associated with a
higher tumor grade, and circulating 27HC levels were elevated in
patients treated with an aromatase inhibitor16–19. In addition to
its effects on primary tumor growth, elevated 27HC also
increased
metastatic
burden.
Somewhat
unexpectedly,
the
pro-metastatic effects of 27HC did not appear to involve ER,
while activation of the liver X receptors (LXRs) was implicated.
Indeed, it was demonstrated that synthetic LXR agonists could
also induce breast cancer cell metastasis albeit less effectively than
27HC. Thus, it appeared likely that in addition to LXR activation,
27HC engaged additional targets that contributed to the meta-
static phenotype. Therefore, the goals of this study were to (1)
determine if cholesterol increases metastasis independent of a
high-fat diet, (2) establish the role of 27HC as a biochemical
mediator of cholesterol associated metastasis, and (3) elucidate
the mechanisms by which 27HC increases metastasis.
Herein, we report that an isocaloric diet high in cholesterol
(HCD) alone was sufficient to increase metastasis in several
pre-clinical models of mammary cancer, firmly establishing a
causative effect of cholesterol on metastasis. This activity could be
attributed to effects of the cholesterol metabolite 27HC on
myeloid cell function and was associated with increased numbers
of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and γδ T cells, and
decreased cytotoxic CD8+ T cells within tumors and metastatic
lesions. Importantly, these studies also highlight the potential
clinical utility of interfering with the production and/or activity of
cholesterol and 27HC in patients with breast cancer and possibly
other solid tumors.
Results
27HC mediates obesity and cholesterol increase in metastasis.
There is compelling evidence that high-fat diets (HFD) increase
tumor growth and metastasis in established models of breast
cancer20, 21. We have previously demonstrated that inhibiting
cholesterol biosynthesis was sufficient to mitigate the impact of a
HFD on tumor growth. Leveraging these results we have explored
the relationship between a HFD, elevated cholesterol, and
metastasis, using relevant in vivo models of breast cancer. We
demonstrated that a high-cholesterol diet alone was sufficient to
increase
spontaneous
lung
metastasis
from
orthotopically
engrafted Met1 tumors (ER-negative breast cancer cells), without
a significant impact on the growth of the primary tumor (Fig. 1a;
Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly, lung colonization by Met1
cells grafted intravenously (i.v.) was also increased in mice on a
high-cholesterol diet (Fig. 1b). The impact of inhibiting choles-
terol biosynthesis on the ability of a HFD to increase breast
cancer metastasis was next assessed. For these studies, we made
use of a transgenic model in which the murine Apoe gene
was replaced with the human APOE3 allele (APOE3 mice)22, as
wild-type mice do not exhibit hypercholesterolemia when fed a
HFD. Using this approach we have previously demonstrated
that a HFD significantly elevates circulating cholesterol and that
this can be inhibited by statin administration16. Importantly, a
HFD resulted in increased metastatic burden when these mice
were grafted with syngeneic E0771 cells, a murine model of
ER-positive mammary cancer (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 Effects of 27HC are mediated by its cancer-cell extrinsic effects on the host. a Mice were pretreated with placebo or 27HC (20 mg/kg) daily for
5 days, at which point Met1 cells expressing iRFP were grafted (i.v.) and treatment ceased. At day 28, lungs were harvested, imaged and iRFP fluorescence
quantified. Experimental timeline outlined above. Representative images of iRFP-expressing Met1 colonies (depicted as black) within the lungs are
presented above quantified data (placebo N = 5, 27HC N = 4, scale bar indicates 5 mm). b Mice were grafted (i.v.) with Met1 cells expressing iRFP on day 0.
On day 5, mice were treated daily with placebo or 27HC for either 5 days or for the remainder of the study (chronic 27HC). At day 28, lungs were
harvested, imaged and iRFP fluorescence quantified. Experimental timeline outlined above quantified data (placebo N = 7, 5 days 27HC N = 7, chronic
27HC N = 6). c Pretreatment of naive mice (regime outlined in a) with the CYP27A1 inhibitor GW297X (100 mg/kg) reduces colonization of lung by
E0771 cells, which is reversed by co-pretreatment with 27HC (N = 5/group). d Pretreatment of mice with GW297X (as in c) results in decreased Met1
colonies. For this experiment, mice were pretreated with placebo or GW297X (100 mg/kg) for 5 days at which point Met1 cells expressing iRFP were
grafted (i.v.) and treatment ceased. Five days post-graft, lungs were harvested, imaged, and fluorescence quantified (placebo N = 9, GW297X N = 10).

 of a HFD on metastasis, thus implicating cholesterol as a
causative agent in this process. Altogether these data implicate
cholesterol as a biochemical link between HFD and increased
metastasis.
Previously, we and others have shown that the ability of
cholesterol
to
promote
breast
tumor
growth
required
its
conversion
by
the
enzyme
CYP27A1
to
the
oxysterol
27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC)16, 17. This effect of 27HC was
shown to result from its ability to function as a partial agonist of
ERα.
It was thus important to determine whether the effect of
hypercholesterolemia on metastasis was also dependent on 27HC,
and if this activity required ERα. To this end, the effects of 27HC
on the metastasis of the ER-negative cell line, Met1, was
examined. Notably, absent an effect on the growth rate of the
primary tumors, 27HC increased the spontaneous metastasis
from this orthotopic tumor model (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, the
pro-metastatic effects of a HCD in MMTV-PyMT mice required
the presence of CYP27A1 (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Fig. 3).
Even when on a normal chow (low cholesterol) diet, lung
metastasis was considerably reduced in PyMT+;CYP27A1−/− mice
when compared to their wild-type counterparts. The importance
of 27HC in this latter activity was confirmed by demonstrating
that treatment with GW273297X, a small molecule inhibitor of
CYP27A1, decreased the spontaneous metastasis of Met1 tumors
to the lung, in normocholesterolemic mice on normal chow
(Fig. 1f). Similarly, GW273297X attenuated the effects of a HFD
on lung-colonization from E0771 grafts in the APOE3 mouse
model
(Fig.
1g;

Fig. 3 Metastatic effects of 27HC require polymorphonuclear neutrophils. a Myeloid-derived immune cells are required for the colonizing effects of 27HC,
as clodronate-liposome depletion of phagocytic cells ablates its effects. Mice were pretreated prior to cellular graft (i.v.) with placebo or 27HC and/or
liposomes containing either PBS or clodronate as outlined in Fig. 2a. Representative images of iRFP-expressing Met1 colonies (depicted as black) within the
lungs are presented above quantified data for both Met1 and E0771 mammary cancer models (Met1 in order from left to right N = 5, 3, 3, 4, E0771 in order
from left to right N = 3, 3, 4, 4, scale bars indicate 5 mm). b 27HC treatment of metastasis bearing mice results in the recruitment of inflammatory
monocytes (IMs) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) to the lung, as assessed by FACS analysis (in order from left to right N = 3, 3, 6). For
comparison, one group of mice received only an i.v. PBS injection (no cells). c 27HC increases in vitro migration of bone marrow-derived neutrophils in a
CXCR2-dependent manner, as the small-molecule inhibitor of CXCR2, SB225002 attenuates its effects (N = 3/group). d Colonizing effect of 27HC
requires activation of CXCR2. Mice were pretreated with indicated ligands for 5 days prior to engraftment with Met1 cells expressing iRFP (as in Fig. 2a).
Representative images of iRFP-expressing Met1 colonies (depicted as black) within the lungs are presented above quantified data (N = 6/group, scale bar
indicates 5 mm). e PMNs are required for the colonizing effects of 27HC, as immune-depletion of PMNs with an antibody against Ly6G (α-Ly6G) ablates
its effects. Mice were pretreated with indicated ligands for 5 days prior to engraftment with Met1 cells expressing iRFP (as in Fig. 2a). Representative
images of iRFP-expressing Met1 colonies (depicted as black) within the lungs are presented above quantified data (placebo groups N = 4, isotype control

 documented in vitro and in vivo, and was confirmed here
(Supplementary Fig. 4)16, 23. While GW273297X significantly
reduced circulating 27HC levels in HFD APOE3 mice, diet and
treatments also led to subtle changes in 24R/S-HC and 22S-HC. It
is possible that GW273297X may have led to alterations in other
cholesterol metabolite levels including those with anti-tumor
properties such as the dendrogenin A, and that these may be
responsible for its activity24. It should be noted that the oxysterol
content of the diets was not specifically determined, and that
accumulation of different oxysterols within the diet could also
contribute to the observed phenotype. Regardless, our data, when
considered in totality, supports a role for 27HC as a downstream
mediator of the pro-metastatic effects of a HFD and cholesterol,
and this activity is independent of the expression of ERα within
cancer cells. These findings, confirmed in multiple models of
mammary cancer, provide strong rationale for the development
of CYP27A1 inhibitors for use in the prevention and/or treatment
of metastatic breast cancer.
27HC promotes metastasis in a tumor cell extrinsic manner.
The effects of 27HC on primary tumor growth require ERα and
27HC-stimulated growth was inhibited with specific antiestro-
gens, indicating that this activity occurs in a tumor cell intrinsic
manner16, 17. However, the dramatic effect of 27HC on the
metastasis of both ERα-positive and ERα-negative tumors sug-
gests that an alternative target is also engaged, raising the ques-
tion as to whether these activities are manifest in a tumor cell
intrinsic manner or if host targets are also involved. In general
support of a tumor cell extrinsic activity for 27HC/HCD was the
observation that a HCD increased the colonization of lung tissue
by ER-negative cancer cells when injected intravenously (i.v.), an
approach that would be expected to minimize the cancer cell
intrinsic effects of cholesterol (Fig. 1b). To address this possibility
in a more definitive manner, naive wild-type mice were pretreated
with either placebo or 27HC, followed by the injection of Met1
mammary cancer cells (i.v.) at such time 27HC treatment was
ceased. The results of this experiment shown in Fig. 2a indicated
that the 27HC pretreated mice had significantly more metastatic
nodules than those that were pretreated with placebo (p = 0.016,
Mann–Whitney test). In this pretreatment model, plasma levels
of 27HC reach 0.334 µM, which is well within circulating levels
found in humans25, and decrease after cessation of injections
(Supplementary Fig. 5). These findings are consistent with 27HC
having its primary effects on metastasis through its actions in
cells other than the cancer cells themselves. This hypothesis was
tested in an additional experiment in which Met1 cells were
engrafted (i.v.) into treatment-naive mice and treatment was
initiated 5 days post-graft, with either placebo or 27HC, allowing
for colonization prior to ligand administration. After 5 days
27HC treatment was discontinued in one group but continued in
another cohort. No increase in metastatic burden was observed in
mice treated with 27HC for 5d post-graft, indicating that the
previously observed effects of 27HC were indeed due to its ability
to ‘‘prime’’ the distal metastatic site (Fig. 2b). Interestingly,
however, chronic treatment with 27HC starting post-graft resul-
ted in a small but significant (p < 0.01, Student Newman-Keuls
(SNK) test) increase in metastatic burden, potentially due to
increased secondary metastatic seeding. At this point it is
not known why this increase is smaller than that observed for
pretreated mice, but may be due to the increased concentration
of circulating cancer cells in the pretreatment model. Basal
concentrations of 27HC were found to be important in priming
the metastatic microenvironment, as pretreatment with the
CYP27A1 inhibitor GW273297X also reduced metastasis as
determined by visual assessment and confirmed by messenger
RNA (mRNA) analysis of genes enriched in epithelial cancer
cells (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 6). The effects of
GW273297X were reversed by co-treatment with exogenous
27HC confirming that the anti-colonization effects of this drug
were mediated through its inhibition of CYP27A1. Interestingly,
the anti-colonization effects of CYP27A1 inhibition were appar-
ent as early as 5 days after cell engraftment (Fig. 2d, Supple-
mentary Fig. 7). We, therefore, conclude that the pro-metastatic
effects of 27HC are likely manifest in a tumor cell extrinsic
manner.
Myeloid cells required for the metastatic effects of 27HC.
Myeloid derived cells are key regulators of the metastatic pro-
cess26, not only in the primary tumor, but also at the distal
metastatic site, where they facilitate the establishment and
subsequent growth of metastatic lesions27, 28. Since 27HC is a
circulating metabolite with the capacity to exert effects at the
distal metastatic site, and recent evidence shows that steroid
hormones
can
alter
myeloid
cell
populations
within
the
tumor microenvironment29, we speculated that the metastatic
phenotype observed in 27HC pretreated mice may involve cells of
the myeloid lineage. In order to test this hypothesis, we repeated
the pretreatment experiment outlined in Fig. 2a, but this time in
the presence or absence of a strategy that would acutely deplete
phagocytic cells of the myeloid lineage. Specifically, 24 and 4 h
before cell graft, mice were treated with liposomes containing
either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or clodronate; clodronate
liposomes being preferentially taken up by phagocytic cells,
thereby eliminating them (Supplementary Fig. 8). As clearly
demonstrated in Fig. 3a, the colonizing effect of 27HC was
completely attenuated in mice lacking myeloid cells. This effect
was consistent between two murine mammary cancer models:
Met1 and E0771.
Tumor-associated macrophages are a collection of functionally
distinct myeloid cells within the tumor, which drive tumor
progression and metastasis30–32. Indeed, we have previously
shown that the myeloid cell repertoire differs among different
tumor types and this is established in large part by the associated
tumor and host-specific factors32. Of specific importance to this
study was our previous observation in E0771 tumors that the
composition of myeloid cell types recruited to the distal
metastatic sites were similar to that of the primary tumor32, with
the exception of inflammatory monocytes (IMs), which were
relatively more abundant in the primary tumor. A comprehensive
analysis of the leukocyte cell composition within the lungs of
placebo
and
27HC-treated
mice
bearing
metastatic
lesions showed that many leukocyte types changed in relative
concentration between metastasis bearing lungs and those free of
metastasis (Supplementary Fig. 9). However, among mice bearing
lung metastases, 27HC treatment consistently resulted in a
robust increase in the numbers of CD11bhigh; Ly6C+; CCR2+
“inflammatory monocytes” (IMs), and Ly6G+ PMNs (Fig. 3b).
Consistent with this finding, treatment with the CYP27A1
inhibitor decreased the presence of these populations (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7). In subsequent analyses we have defined IMs as
CD11bhigh; Ly6Chigh; Ly6Glow-negative.
We have previously demonstrated that metastatic lungs exhibit
a dramatic increase in PMNs compared to IMs, implicating
PMNs in the pathogenesis of metastasis, and indicating that IMs
may
be
‘‘responding’’
cells
rather
than
initiating
cells32.
Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated critical roles for
PMNs in breast cancer metastasis formation33, 34. Therefore, we
tested whether the effects of 27HC were mediated by PMNs. It
has been demonstrated by others that PMN cell trafficking to sites
of inflammation is regulated in part by processes downstream of

 the chemokine receptor CXCR235. Furthermore, it has been
reported that oxysterols can interact with and activate CXCR236.
Thus, we first investigated whether 27HC had the capacity to
increase the migration of primary PMNs in an in vitro model.
As shown in Fig. 3c, 27HC increased the migration of primary
bone-derived neutrophils, and this activity was quantitatively
inhibited by co-treatment with SB225002, a small molecule
CXCR2 antagonist. The involvement of CXCR2 was confirmed
using
PMNs
isolated
from
CXCR2fl/fl
and
infected
with
lentivirus containing an expression vector for Cre-recombinase
(Supplementary Fig. 10). The migratory stimulation by 27HC was
consistent in two cell lines representing myeloid cell precursors
(RAW264.7 and U937 cells; Supplementary Fig. 10). Further, the
migratory induction by 27HC was unchanged when 27HC
was added to the bottom chamber or top chamber, indicating
that 27HC might not be a chemoattractant per se. Importantly,
27HC-dependent metastasis of Met1 cells following tail vein
injection was also inhibited by pretreatment with SB225002
(Fig. 3d).
To specifically test whether the pro-metastatic effects of 27HC
required PMNs, we adopted an immune-depletion strategy to
remove Ly6G+ cells. Mice were pretreated with placebo or 27HC
for 5 days. Thirty-six and 12 h prior to cell engraftment, mice
were injected with either purified anti-Ly6G antibody or a
corresponding isotype control. Successful immune depletion of
PMNs at the time of graft was confirmed by flow cytometry
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Importantly, the pro-metastatic effects
of 27HC were completely absent in mice whose PMNs were
depleted, strongly supporting our hypothesis that 27HC-recruited
PMNs facilitate metastasis (Fig. 3e). On the other hand,
while colonization was reduced when IMs were either depleted
with an antibody against Ly6C, or their recruitment was reduced
with the CCR2 antagonist RS-504393, 27HC continued to
stimulate colonization (Supplementary Fig. 12).
PMNs and γδ-T cells mediate metastatic effects of 27HC. It has
been shown previously that by secreting interleukin-17 (IL-17),
γδ-T cells can induce the expansion and polarization of
granulocytes. These polarized PMNs are then enabled to actively
suppress cytotoxic CD8+ T cells33. We adopted a method to
enrich for PMNs from bone marrow and confirmed their viability
in cell culture (Supplementary Fig. 13). Using an in vitro
co-culture approach wherein bone marrow-derived cells enriched
for PMNs by density gradient centrifugation were cultured with
splenocytes, it was determined that 27HC treatment resulted in
an increase in the numbers of rare γδ-T cells compared to vehicle
treated cells, most likely due to the increased expansion of this
cell type (Fig. 4a). Notably, the expansion of γδ-T cells driven by
27HC required the presence of excess neutrophils, as culturing of
splenocytes alone with 27HC did not induce γδ-T-cell prolifera-
tion (Fig. 4b). This suggests that unlike previous reports33,
neutrophils have a role in stimulating γδ-T cell growth in the
presence of 27HC. However, the main effector cell of 27HC
signaling has yet to be determined. Importantly, modeling
colonization by analyzing early stage tumors, a critical stage for
immune-suppression, it was further determined that treatment
with 27HC also increased the number of both intratumoral
γδ-T cells and PMNs (Fig. 4c, d). A corresponding decrease in
CD8+ T cells was also observed (Fig. 4e), consistent with the
hypothesis that 27HC does indeed suppress cytotoxic immune
cell activity. Similarly, we found that 27HC increased the presence
of γδ-T cells and decreased cytotoxic T cells within the lungs, 24 h
post i.v. inoculation with Met1 cells (Fig. 4f–h). Immune ablation
of γδ-T cells did not have a significant impact on basal
colonization of Met1 cells (p > 0.05, SNK test), but completely
attenuated
27HC-induced
colonization,
indicating
that
in
addition to PMNs, these cells are critical mediators of 27HC
(Fig. 4i, Supplementary Fig. 14). These effects were corroborated
using the E0771 model in mice void of γδ-T cells (Tcrdtm1/mom/J,
also known as TCRD−/−) (Fig. 4j). Interestingly, and in support
of our co-culture assays, we found that 27HC failed to increase
γδ-T cells in the absence of PMNs, while it continued to promote
an increase of PMNs in the metastatic lungs of mice immune
depleted of γδ-T cells (Supplementary Fig. 15). This would
indicate that PMNs are the primary effector cells of 27HC and
that γδ-T cells are ‘‘responding cells’’ the presence of which are
required for the full effects of 27HC. Previous studies have shown
that metastasis-associated PMNs have an increased expression of
Prok2, NOS2, S100A8 and S100A933. When bone marrow
derived PMNs were cultured, 27HC modestly induced the mRNA
expression of Prok2 and NOS2, while having no effect on S100A8
or S100A9 (Supplementary Fig. 16). Likewise, 27HC did not
significantly regulate the expression of these genes in splenocytes
(p > 0.05, SNK test). However, when PMNs were co-cultured with
splenocytes (similar to Fig. 4a), the induction of Prok2 and NOS2
by 27HC was significantly enhanced, and S100A8 and S100A9
were now both induced (p < 0.05, SNK test). The enhanced
induction of these genes was not apparent when splenocytes from
TCRD−/− mice were co-cultured with wild-type bone marrow
(Supplementary Fig. 16). Collectively, this data suggests that
27HC results in increased PMNs at the metastatic site, but that
γδ-T cells are required for their full pro-tumorigenic properties.
However, further experimentation is now required to test this
model and determine the precise interactions between PMNs and
γδ-T cells.
Immune depletion of CD8+ T cells resulted in increased basal
colonization which 27HC did not increase further (Fig. 4k).
Therefore, it is likely that through its actions on PMNs and/or
γδ-T cells, 27HC suppresses cytotoxic CD8+ cells, thereby
allowing cancer cells to escape immune surveillance at distal
metastatic sites. Highlighting the clinical relevance of our findings
are data from the TCGA, which indicates that in patients with
low tumoral CYP7B1 (and thus expected elevated 27HC) there is
increased expression of the granulocyte marker CD66b and the
PMN polarizing factor IL-17 (Fig. 4l). On the other hand, low
CYP7B1 expression is also associated with decreased expression
of CD3e and perforin, markers of T-cell infiltration and cytotoxic
activity, respectively.
27HC increases metastasis of other solid tumor types. The
results presented thus far suggest that the effects of 27HC on
metastasis are due in large part to its actions on host cells. Thus,
we speculated that the pro-metastatic effects of 27HC may also
increase metastasis of cancer cells other than those derived from
breast tumors. Using i.v. injection of cancer cells as a model of
metastasis, it was determined that 27HC pretreatment increased
the number of metastatic nodules in the lungs when syngeneic
colorectal cancer cells (MC38), lung cancer cells (Lewis Lung),
melanoma (B16-F0) or pancreatic cells (KPC915) were injected
(Supplementary Fig. 17). Increased colonization of pancreatic
cancer cells to the heart and liver, or melanoma cells to the liver,
were also observed in 27HC-treated mice. Further, the number
of nodules formed after injection of colorectal cancer cells into
wild-type mice was significantly higher than in mice that lack
the ability to synthesize 27HC (CYP27A1−/− mice; p = 0.03).
Considering these studies performed in well-validated models, it
is concluded that cholesterol, secondary to its conversion to
27HC, is likely to impact metastasis of a broad range of tumor
types; a result that highlights the importance of this axis as a
therapeutic target.

 Discussion
Considerable epidemiological data links both obesity and elevated
cholesterol with an increased likelihood of recurrence in breast
cancer patients, while statins have been shown to significantly
improve prognosis. Although several studies have indicated
that ‘‘Western diets’’ high in both fat and cholesterol increase
mammary cancer metastasis8, the specific contributions of
cholesterol in this process have not been evaluated. Therefore,
using clinically relevant murine models of breast cancer, we show
that (1) elevated cholesterol alone can increase metastasis, (2) the
metastatic effects of obesity are mediated in part by elevations in
cholesterol, and (3) statin intervention can attenuate the effects of
a high-fat diet. Furthermore, it was determined that the effect of
dietary cholesterol on metastasis requires CYP27A1, the enzyme
responsible for the synthesis of 27HC. In support of the idea that
the 27HC signaling axis mediates the effects of cholesterol, it was
shown that exogenous supplementation with 27HC robustly
increased lung metastasis from tumors and colonization from i.v.
grafts. It is important to note that although our studies implicate
27HC as a mediator of the pro-metastatic actions of cholesterol
they do not rule out the possibility that other metabolites
of 27HC, such as cholestenoic acid, may also be involved.
Furthermore,
we
have
not
investigated
how
27HC
treatment might also alter other metabolites, in particular
cholesterol-5,6-epoxides. These epoxides have been shown have
anti-tumor properties, and in fact tamoxifen is a ligand for the
enzyme
responsible
for
their
synthesis
(cholesterol
epoxide hydrolase, ChEH). Treatment of breast cancer cells with
tamoxifen leads to the accumulation cholesterol-5,6α-epoxide,
contributing
to
the
efficacy
of
this
drug37.
Furthermore,
cholesterol-5,6α-epoxide can react with histamine to form
dendrogenin A, a metabolite with tumor-suppressing activity24.
Therefore, it will be important for future studies to consider the
complete cholesterol-homeostatic landscape.
We and others have shown previously that 27HC can function
as an endogenous SERM38, 39. In models of the cardiovascular
system, for instance, 27HC behaves as an ER-antagonist, while it
functions as a partial agonist in osteoblasts and in ER-positive
breast cancer cells39–42. In animal models of ER-positive breast
cancer, the partial agonist activity of 27HC is sufficient to support
tumor growth16, 17. It has also been demonstrated that 27HC
can function as a robust LXR agonist and that similar to other
synthetic LXR agonists it induces the expression of markers of the
epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells (EMT)
16, 40, 43. However, induction of this program by pretreating cells
with 27HC prior to their engraftment in mice, resulted in a very
modest increase in metastasis as compared to that which was
observed when cells were engrafted into 27HC pretreated
mice (ref. 16 and Fig. 2a). Thus, although 27HC can induce
the expression of some of the key markers of EMT, it is likely that
the cancer cell extrinsic actions of 27HC are most important in
facilitating metastasis. Indeed, the pro-metastatic activities of
27HC were readily apparent in studies designed to isolate the
activities of this oxysterol to the host. Although subtle, an
increased metastatic burden was observed in mice grafted i.v. with
cancer cells and subsequently treated with 27HC in a chronic
manner. We believe that this may represent the promotion of
‘‘secondary’’ seeding events. This observation is significant as it
suggests that inhibition of 27HC synthesis or action may be
beneficial in patients who have already been diagnosed with
metastatic disease.
In this study, it was demonstrated that the pro-metastatic
effects of 27HC were entirely dependent on the presence of
clodronate-liposome sensitive myeloid cells, which are known to
contribute significantly to the metastatic process27, 28, 44–46. The
role of granulocytes in metastasis is somewhat enigmatic in that
they have been shown to have both positive and negative effects
on tumor biology, these effects being elaborated in a context
specific manner. However, neutrophil infiltration at the distal site
has been shown to be required for metastasis and such infiltration
has been attributed to activation of CXCR2 and resulting
downstream signaling events33, 34, 47.
Immune cell profiling indicated both IMs and PMNs were
increased in the metastatic lungs of mice treated with 27HC.
Since the motility of PMNs is induced by CXCR2 signaling, and
considering previous reports that oxysterols can activate CXCR2,
we tested the possibility that the effect of 27HC on metastasis
resulted
from
its
ability
to
activate
CXCR2
in
PMNs.
Two important findings in this study support this hypothesis:
(1) a small molecule inhibitor of CXCR2 was able to ablate
the colonizing effects of 27HC, and (2) 27HC had no effect on
cancer cell colonization in animals in which PMNs were
immune-depleted. On the other hand, while depletion of IMs
reduced basal colonization, 27HC continued to promote cancer
cell colonization under these conditions.
T-cell subtypes have been shown to have dramatic effects that
promote or inhibit cancer progression. Specifically, CD4+ CD25+
T-regulatory cells (or Tregs) have been shown to suppress
anti-tumor immune responses by CD8+ T cells48. Further,
CD8+CD3+ cytotoxic T cells naturally respond to the presence of
cancer cells and initiate apoptotic mechanisms in tumor cells,
but their effectiveness is neutralized by host factors produced by
cells within the tumor environment49, 50. Bridging the gap
between these axes are γδ T-cell receptor (TCR)+ CD3+ T cells; a
rare population of T lymphocytes whose characteristics straddle
those of innate and adaptive immunity. These lymphocytes are
thought to develop from the same late precursor as αβ TCR+
T cells, but gain their specific TCRs during development in the
thymus51. In contrast to αβ TCR+ T lymphocytes, γδ-T cells can
be activated through direct recognition of ligands, and can initiate
rapid immune responses. Though earlier reports have indicated
their anti-cancer activity52–54, recent reports provide compelling
arguments for their cancer-promoting role. It has been shown
that γδ-T cells infiltrate tumors, and encourage metastasis by
secreting IL-17, which modulates the polarization of neutrophils
and that this results in the suppression of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell
proliferation and effector phenotype33. Our work suggests a
feed-forward mechanism whereby 27HC stimulates the recruit-
ment of PMNs which are required for the proliferative action
of 27HC on γδ-T cells, and based on previous reports33, the
γδ-T cells would then promote further PMN recruitment
in addition to polarizing PMNs into an immune-suppressive
subtype. Although we have not specifically investigated PMN
polarization, we did find that the induction of certain genes
associated with metastasis-associated PMNs by 27HC required
the presence of γδ-T cells. The numbers of γδ-T cells are
significantly elevated in the tumors of patients with advanced
disease, and elevated numbers are a marker for poor prognosis55.
Most relevant to this study, is the ability of γδ-T cells to recognize
and respond to lipid antigens56, cancer cell-derived antigens57,
and mevalonate metabolites in tumor cells58. Our results
demonstrating the effect of 27HC on this T-cell population
supports a model whereby 27HC leads to the activation/recruit-
ment of γδ-T cells and PMNs, the activity of both cell types
being ultimately responsible for the suppression of CD8+
cytotoxic T cells and pro-colonizing properties of 27HC. The
precise molecular mechanisms by which 27HC impacts immune
biology in these cells remains to be determined.
Here, we show that 27HC is a major biochemical mediator of
the metastatic effects of hypercholesterolemia. Indeed, 27HC is a
circulating metabolite that dramatically increases breast cancer
metastasis through its interaction with γδ-T cells and PMNs.

 Although the precise signaling events involved are not yet known,
27HC has previously been shown to interact with the ERs, LXRs,
and CXCR2. Of note, a recent report indicates that ER signaling
can lead to altered myeloid cell infiltration and activity within the
ovarian tumor microenvironment29. In addition, a recent report
indicates that cholesterol is a ligand for the estrogen-related
receptor alpha (ERRα), and modeling would suggest that 27HC
might also interact with this receptor59. All four of these potential
targets
are
highly
amenable
to
therapeutic
intervention.
Notable was the observation that genetic or small molecule
dependent inhibition of CYP27A1 significantly reduced breast
cancer colonization of the lungs in two clinically relevant animal
models. While statin therapy may be effective in the short term, a
recent ‘‘window of opportunity’’ study indicated that HMG-CoA
reductase was upregulated in tumors from patients treated with
statins, indicating that downstream targeting (such as CYP27A1
or the effectors of 27HC) will likely be more efficacious60.
Furthermore, since the effects of 27HC are on the host
environment, its effects are likely to be broadly applicable to all
solid tumors, and we present evidence that this is the case for
colorectal, pancreatic, melanoma, and lung cancers.
Methods
Reagents. 27HC and GW273297X were synthesized by Sai Life (Hyderabad,
India). HFD and its corresponding control (5TJS and 5TJN) were purchased from
TestDiet. HCD (2% cholesterol and 0.5% sodium cholate) and its respective CD
(0.5% sodium cholate) were purchased from TestDiet (5CNY and 5BRW). 27HC
and GW273297X for in vivo administration were solubilized in 40% (2-hydro-
xypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin at room temperature, sterile filtered (0.2 µm) and then
stored at 4 °C prior to subcutaneous injections (20 mg/kg for 27HC, 100 mg/kg for
GW273297X). Auto-oxidation of these compounds was not specifically controlled
for in their formulation. Antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from BD
Biosciences or R&D systems and used at a working dilution of 1:100 in FACS
buffer (2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in PBS, supplemented with penicillin/strep-
tomycin). Catalogue numbers as follows: CD11b: 557686, CD11c: 563735, Ly6C:
553104, Ly6G: 551461, CCR2: FAB5538A, CD3: 555275, CD4: 553729, CD8:
557682, TCRγ/δ: 563532. Immune depletion antibodies and their isotype controls
are as follows: α-Ly6G clone 1A8 from BioLegend catalogue number 400544; α
-Ly6C clone HK1.4 from BioXCell catalogue number BE0284; α-TCRγ/δ clone
UC7-13D5 and isotype control from BioXCell catalogue numbers UC7-13D5 and
BE0091; α-CD8 clone YTS 169.4 from BioXCell catalogue number BP0117; isotype
control for α-Ly6G, α -Ly6C and α-CD8 were from BioLegend catalogue number
127632).
Cell culture. E0771 cells were obtained from Mark Dewhirst (Duke University)
and grown in RPMI supplemented with 8% FBS, non-essential amino acids,
sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin. Met1 cells were obtained from
Alexander Borowsky (University of California at Davis) and grown in Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with the same supplements. All cell lines were
routinely tested for mycoplasma. Met1 and E0771 cells were stably transfected with
infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP) as previously described16.
Histology. Metastatic lungs were fixed in 10% formalin followed by 70% ethanol,
embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Resulting sections were stained with hema-
toxylin and eosin (H&E).
FACS quantification of cell types. Metastatic lungs were digested in a collagenase
solution in DMEM (1 mg/ml). Resulting dispersed cells were stained with anti-
bodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell populations were identified by flow
cytometry based on previous description32 as follows: IMs: CD11bhigh; Ly6Chigh;
Ly6Glow-negative; CCR2+, PMNs: CD11b+; Ly6Clow-negative; Ly6Ghigh, γδ-T cells:
CD3+; CD4−; CD8−; γδ-TCR+, cytotoxic T cells: CD3+; CD4−; CD8+. Antibodies
were used at a working dilution of 1:100.
Animal studies. All protocols involving animals were previously approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of either Duke University School of
Medicine or the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Sample size was
determined by previous experience with models, animal availability and end-point
statistics (power analysis). C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories or Jackson Laboratories. Tcrdtm1/mom/J (TCRD−/−) mice were
purchased from Jackson Laboratories and bred in house. Animals were randomized
into indicated dietary regimens or treatment groups prior to graft. Genetic models
were randomized post-genotyping, prior to any measurements. Some experiments
were blinded from personnel in charge of treatment (as in personnel taking
measurements did not know treatment groups) (Figs. 1c, e, g, 2b, and 3b,
Supplementary Figs. 3–5, and 7).
Humanized APOE3 mice were generated previously22. They were
ovariectomized at ~6 weeks of age and placed on their respective diets for 8 weeks.
Daily treatment with indicated ligands commenced 7 days prior to engraftment
(i.v.) with E0771-iRFP cells. Atorvastatin was administered by oral gavage (40 mg/
kg) and GW273297X by subcutaneous injection (100 mg/kg). Corresponding body
weights are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2. Resulting oxysterol concentrations
are presented in Supplementary Fig. 4.
MMTV-PyMT+;CYP27A1−/− and MMTV-PyMT+;CYP27A1+/+ mice were
previously generated on a mixed FVB/C57BL/6 background as described16. Mice
were co-housed and placed on their respective diets (CD or HCD) at wean. At
~5 weeks of age mice were ovariectomized by surgical removal of the ovaries under
anesthesia. Mice were euthanized when their collective tumor burden reached 2000
mm3. RNA was extracted from the lungs and complementary DNA was generated
as previously described16. Metastasis was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR
(QPCR) to quantify PyMT mRNA expression in the lungs16. QPCR was performed
using a BioRad CFX384 machine and the BioRad iTaq Universal Sybr Green
Supermix; PyMT primers are as follows: [GAGTTCTCCAACAGATACACCC]

Supplementary Fig. 3.
Met1 cells were grafted into female FVB mice at least 8 weeks of age. E0771 cells
were grafted into ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice at least 8 weeks of age. For tumor
studies (Fig. 1a, d), cells were grafted orthotopically into the mammary fat pad, and
resulting tumor growth assessed by direct caliper measurement. For colonization
experiments, cells were grafted intravenously via the tail vein. For studies involving
these cell lines, metastasis was assessed by ex vivo imaging of lungs on a Licor
Odyssey (Figs. 1a, b, d, f, 2a, b, 3, and 4c–i), or by counting visible nodules (Figs. 2c
and 4j) and normalized to control or placebo as indicated. Briefly, the trachea was
cannulated and lungs inflated with a cold PBS solution, removed from the mouse
and placed in a cold PBS solution. Visible nodules were counted, or lungs were
scanned at an excitation of 700 nm on a Licor Odyssey apparatus.
Pretreatment model. Mice were pretreated with placebo (40% (2-hydroxypropyl)-
β-cyclodextrin), 27HC, GW2973297X or SB225002 daily for 5 days (subcutaneous)
at which point treatment was ceased. Twenty-four hours after the final injection,
cancer cells were grafted i.v. (tail vein; 500,000 Met1, MC36, B16/F0 or Lewis Lung
cells, 106 E0771 or KPC915 cells). Clodronate liposomes or PBS liposomes (VU
Medisch Centrum) were injected i.v. (0.2 ml) 24 h and again 4 h prior to cell
engraftment. SB 225002 was administered 2×/day at a dose of 1 mg/kg during the
27HC pretreatment period. Immune depletion studies were done by injecting mice
during the 27HC pretreatment period with 400 and 100 µg of the antibodies or
their respective isotype controls 36 and 12 h (respectively) prior to engraftment
with Met1-iRFP cells. Depletion of respective immune populations was confirmed
24 h post-inoculation by FACS analysis. Pretreatment with GW273297X was
similar as for 27HC pretreatment experiments. For Fig. 2c, 27HC was co-
administered with GW273297X for one group.
For early tumor studies, 8-week-old female C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River,
Wilmington, MA) were ovariectomized and allowed to recover for 1 week.
E0771 cells were then injected into an axillary mammary fat pad. Two days after
E0771 engraftment, mice were treated daily with subcutaneous injections of either
27HC (20 mg/kg) or vehicle (cyclodextrin). Eight days post-engraftment, mice were
euthanized and tumors removed for flow cytometric analysis.
Plasma cholesterol and oxysterol quantification. Plasma was sent to the
Duke Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resources for analysis by ultra-
performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/tandem mass
spectrometry using a customized method allowing chromatographic resolution of
the isobaric hydroxycholesterol species. A standard curve of 27HC (0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5,
1, and 5 μM made up in BSA) was generated. Plasma concentrations of 27HC were
determined by calculating the ratio of analyte to internal standard within each
sample, and using this value as ‘‘y’’ in the linear regression equation generated from
the standard curve. 24(R/S)-HC, 22(R)-HC, 22(S)-HC, 4b-HC, 7a/b-HC and
cholesterol concentrations are semi-quantitative, calculated based on a ratio to each
internal standard (stable-isotope dilution).
In vitro studies of PMNs. Bone marrow-derived cells were isolated by cen-
trifugation on a density gradient containing Histopaque 1077 layered over
Histopaque 1119 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). The lower of two resulting bands
of cells was collected and plated in complete RPMI media (including 8.85% FBS;
Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cells from spleens were resuspended in complete RPMI
media, and counted. Bone marrow cells and splenocytes were then co-cultured by
seeding a 1:20 ratio of PMN:Splenocytes, and treated with indicated ligands. Cells
were incubated for 4 days (Fig. 4a, b) or 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 16) and then
harvested for further analysis.
Migration assays. Cells were seeded in the top of Boyden Chambers with con-
ditioned media from breast cancer cells as well as indicated ligands in the bottom
chamber. Staining and quantification were performed as described previously40.

 CXCR2fl/fl mice were originally purchased from Jackson Laboratories. For assays
involving PMNs from these mice (Supplementary Fig. 10a), PMNs were infected
with lentivirus expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of a CMV promoter
(MOI of 1, GeneCopoeia) for 24 h prior to use in the migration assay. Expression of
Cre-recombinase and reduction of CXCR2 mRNA was confirmed by QPCR.
Analysis of TCGA data. TCGA microarray expression data from 817 invasive
breast carcinomas was obtained from the C-BioPortal (data set described in
refs 61–63). Data from patients whose gene expression for either CYP7B1, CD66b,
IL-17, CD3e, or Perforin read ‘‘NaN’’ were discluded leaving 421 usable samples.
Array gene expression data was transformed (2^(Expression)), and parsed based on
median CYP7B1 expression. Data (as displayed in Fig. 4l) was tested for normal
distribution prior to non-parametric Mann–Whitney test for significance.
Statistics. Data was assessed for normality and were ln-transformed or a
non-parametric test was chosen as appropriate. No replicates were excluded, with
the exception of one mouse (Fig. 4c–e) as the cell-graft was not successful. One-way
ANOVA followed by a SNK multiple comparison test was used for Figs. 1c, e, g, 2b,
c, 3a–e, and 4i–k. Unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test was used for Figs. 1a, b, d, f,
2a, d, and 4a–h. Fisher’s Exact test was used for Supplementary Fig. 17.
Mann–Whitney tests were used for Fig. 4l. Statistical differences (p < 0.05) are
indicated on graphs with asterisks and/or lines.
Data availability. The TCGA data referenced during the study are available in a
public repository from the cBioPortal For Cancer Genomics website (http://www.
cbioportal.org/). All the data that support the findings of this study are available
within the article and its Supplementary Information files or from the corre-
