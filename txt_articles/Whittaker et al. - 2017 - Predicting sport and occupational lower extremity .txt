Abstract
Background—Identification of risk factors for lower extremity (LE) injury in sport and military/
first-responder occupations is required to inform injury prevention strategies.
Objective—To determine if poor movement quality is associated with LE injury in sport and 
military/first-responder occupations.
Material and methods—Five electronic databases were systematically searched. Studies 
selected included: original data; analytic design; movement quality outcome (qualitative rating of 
functional compensation, asymmetry, impairment or efficiency of movement control); LE injury 
sustained with sport or military/first-responder occupation. The PRISMA guidelines were 
followed. Two independent authors assessed the quality [Downs and Black (DB) criteria] and level 
of evidence (Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine model).
Results—Of 4361 potential studies, 17 were included. The majority were low quality cohort 
studies (level 4 evidence). Median DB score was 11/33 (range 3–15). Heterogeneity in 
methodology and injury definition precluded meta-analyses. The Functional Movement Screen 
was the most common outcome investigated (15/17 studies). Four studies considered 
interrelationships between risk factors, seven reported diagnostic accuracy and none tested an 
intervention program targeting individuals identified as high-risk. There is inconsistent evidence 
that poor movement quality is associated with increased risk of LE injury in sport and military/
first-responder occupations.
Conclusions—Future research should focus on high quality cohort studies to identify the most 
relevant movement quality outcomes for predicting injury risk followed by developing and 
evaluating pre-participation screening and LE injury prevention programs through high quality 
randomized controlled trials targeting individuals at greater risk of injury based upon screening 
tests with validated test properties.

BACKGROUND
Due to the increasing prevalence and cost of treating chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) 
conditions such as hip, knee and ankle osteoarthritis (OA) there has been a call for scientific 
inquiry focused on shifting the approach taken to manage these conditions away from 
treatment and toward prevention.1 From an epidemiological perspective prevention of

 chronic MSK conditions may include strategies aimed at reducing MSK injuries in 
susceptible populations (primary prevention) and/or strategies aimed at slowing down or 
halting the onset of the chronic MSK disorder after a MSK injury has occurred (secondary 
prevention). Susceptible populations for MSK injury include those that participate in sport 
and recreation, or have a service related occupation (e.g., military and first responders such 
as police officers, fire fighters and paramedics).23 For example epidemiological surveys have 
shown that the risk of injury is 1.5 to 2.0 times greater amongst individuals that participate 
in a variety of sporting and physical activities,2 and that MSK injury is the leading cause of 
disability in the military.4 In both of these at risk populations the most common MSK 
injuries are those that involve the lower extremities (LE).3
Van Mechelen5 proposed a 4-step model for injury prevention. This model involves 
establishing the extent of the specific injury burden of interest, followed by identifying 
injury risk factors and causal mechanisms through prospective analysis. The first two steps 
inform the development and introduction of preventative strategies (step four), which should 
then be evaluated to determine their impact on injury burden (step five). Finch et al6 
expanded upon this model emphasizing the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of 
preventative strategies in real-world implementation contexts and Meeuwisse et al7 
emphasized the importance of acknowledging that injury is a consequence of complex 
interactions of multiple risk factors and inciting events. Consequently, studies aimed at 
identifying risk factors for LE injuries and accompanying preventative strategies should 
engage end-users, utilize a prospective design and ensure an adequate sample size to 
facilitate biostatistical methods that consider the interrelationships between various risk 
factors.8 Further, to establish the value of injury risk screening on injury burden it is crucial 
that there is an accumulation of high quality evidence indicating that an intervention 
program targeting those at high risk of injury based on a screening program is more 
beneficial than a non-targeted intervention.9
Concomitant to injury prevention models is the development of approaches to identify ‘high-
risk’ individuals. Identification of these individuals enables prevention programs to be 
individually targeted, improving their effectiveness and public health impact (e.g., health 
care cost reduction). One method that is widely used to identify individuals at high-risk of 
injury are movement screening tests. The value of these tests is that they can be administered 
on-field or in clinical settings and are less costly than tests that require specialized 
equipment or highly trained personnel (e.g., laboratory tools such as 3D motion analysis). 
Additional advantages of movement screening tests are that they can be administered to a 
large number of individuals, are easily adapted to various sporting or occupation 
environments and provide almost immediate results. Further, as movement is modifiable, 
these tests provide information that can directly inform a prevention strategy and possibly 
assist in return to activity decisions.
Movement screening can involve the assessment of a single movement task or a composite 
battery of movement tasks. Further, participants can be assessed on their physical 
performance and/or the quality with which they move. Assessment of physical performance 
would consider a quantifiable outcome(s) of sport or occupational strength, power, balance, 
agility etc., often through multi-joint movements (e.g., Triple Single Leg Hop, Y Balance

 Test).1011 Conversely, assessment of movement quality involves qualitative identification 
and rating of functional compensations, asymmetries, impairments or efficiency of 
movement control through transitional (e.g. squats, sit to stand, lunge) or dynamic 
movement (e.g. hopping, walking, running, landing, cutting) tasks. Both physical 
performance and movement quality assessments would ideally align with the sport or 
occupation specific context. Although there is consensus and several recent high-quality 
summaries of the clinimetric properties (e.g., validity, reliability and diagnostic accuracy) 
and evidence related to predicting injury risk and successful return to sport for physical 
performance outcomes,1011 the same cannot be said for movement quality outcomes.
As identification of risk factors and casual mechanisms are precursors to the development of 
effective prevention strategies, the lack of consensus related to movement quality risk factors 
for LE injury in sport and service occupations has likely hindered the process of developing 
and evaluating injury prevention strategies. The primary objective of this systematic review 
is to determine whether screening movement quality (a qualitative rating of functional 
compensation, asymmetry, impairment or efficiency of movement control either with 
individual movements tasks or a composite battery of movement tasks) can predict LE injury 
in sport and/or occupational (e.g., military, first responders) populations of all ages. A 
secondary objective is to summarize the clinimetric properties of the movement quality 
screening tests in the identified literature to inform clinicians and future research aimed at 
the development and use of movement quality screening.
METHODS
This review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42015026958) and conducted 
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines.12
Data Sources and Search
Relevant studies were identified by searching five online databases, selected based on their 
relevance to the research topics, from inception to January 2016. These databases included: 
Medline, EMBASE (Excerpta medical databases), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing 
and Allied Health Literature), Sport Discus, and SCOPUS. The combination of medical 
subject headings (MeSH) and text words that were used to execute each search was 
developed in consultation with a health sciences librarian scientist (LD). Appendix 1 
outlines the search terms used for population, injury type, screening type, screening quality, 
measurement as well as limits and exclusions, along with combinations of search terms that 
formed the final search strategy. The search strategy (specifically filters 3 and 4) from 
Kroman et al13 was heavily used as a source of search terms for screening quality and 
measurement concepts. Limits included: English language; human and MSK condition 
studies published in peer-reviewed journal. Articles were organized using the reference 
management software package, EndNote version 7.1 (Thomson Reuters, 2013). The number 
of references obtained from each search strategy for each database was recorded and a 
running total constructed. After accounting for duplication, the titles and corresponding 
abstracts of all returned records were independently reviewed by two of the authors blinded

 to record author(s) and journal title using a Microsoft Excel workbook designed specifically 
for screening.14 Data were compiled and consensus (first between the two reviewers and if 
required by the lead author) regarding potentially relevant studies was reached on items in 
which there was disagreement. Prior to title and abstract review all authors independently 
screened a random sample of 120 titles and abstracts in which they were blinded to authors 
and journal title and reached strong agreement with the lead author (agreement ranging from 
81–97%, Kappa ranging from 0.13–0.49) using an Excel workbook designed specifically for 
this purpose.1415 Finally, two authors independently reviewed the full text of all potentially 
relevant studies to determine final study selection.
Study Selection
Studies were included if they investigated the prospective association between a movement 
quality outcome (defined as a qualitative rating of functional compensation, asymmetry, 
impairment or efficiency of movement control during either an individual movement task or 
battery of movement tasks) and MSK LE injury (defined as an injury involving the hip joint 
or distal). Additional inclusion criteria included: primary research with original data, 
analytic or intervention design, an outcome measure of LE injury sustained during sport or 
military/first-responder occupation participation and an objective exposure measure of one 
or more potential movement quality risk factor for LE injury. Studies were excluded if they 
were not written in English or involved animal models or cadavers. Further, conference 
proceedings or abstracts, editorials, commentaries, opinion-based papers review articles 
(systematic and narrative), case series, case studies, or studies in which screening did not 
take place prior to injury onset (e.g., cross-sectional) were excluded.
Data extraction and study rating process
Data extracted from each study included: study year; design; study location and population 
(e.g., sport, military/first-responder occupation, age, sample size); injury outcome (e.g., 
definition) and how it was ascertained; injury estimates (e.g., incidence proportion, 
incidence rate, prevalence); risk factors, and results (e.g., significant and non-significant) 
including measures of reliability, measures of risk [e.g., difference in means, correlations, 
odds ratio (OR), incidence rate ratios; IRR and risk ratio (RR)] and diagnostic accuracy 
(e.g., sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, positive or 
negative likelihood ratios). Two authors independently assessed the quality and level of 
evidence of each study. Quality of evidence was evaluated based on criteria for internal 
validity (study design, quality of reporting, presence of selection and misclassification bias, 
potential confounding) and external validity (generalizability) using the Downs and Black 
(DB) quality assessment tool which assigns an individual score calculated out of 32 total 
points for each study (11 points for reporting, 3 points for external validity, 7 points for bias, 
6 points for confounding and 5 for power: Appendix 2)16. The level of evidence represented 
by each study was categorized based upon the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine 
(OCEBM) 2009 model (Appendix 3).17 As per study exclusion criteria, levels 1a, 2a, 3a 
(systematic reviews), 4 (case series) and 5 (opinion-based papers) were not included. 
Discrepancies in DB scoring or OCEBM categorization were resolved first by consensus 
between the two reviewers who rated the study and if required, by the lead author (JW).

 Data synthesis
Extracted data, quality and level of evidence were summarized for each study. The quantity, 
quality and level of evidence for the most commonly investigated movement quality risk 
factors for LE injury in sport military/first-responder occupation were collated.
RESULTS
Identification of studies
An overview of the study identification process is provided in Figure 1. The initial search 
yielded 8219 articles, 3858 duplicates were removed leaving 4361 potentially relevant 
articles. Following the removal of studies not meeting inclusion criteria based on abstract 
review (e.g., not human studies, ineligible study design, not sport or military/first-responder 
occupation, no LE injury, no movement quality risk factor, no association between a 
movement quality risk factor and LE injury) this was reduced to 119. Subsequent to full 
article evaluation by the two independent reviewers, 102 were excluded leaving 17 studies 
deemed appropriate for inclusion to the systematic review. Due to inconsistent methodology 
and injury definition, and heterogeneity of the risk factors examined, meta-analyses was 
precluded (see Table 1).
Study characteristics
Characteristics of the 17 included studies are summarized in Table 1. Sixteen of the 17 
studies were cohort studies, representing four countries (13 from the United States,18–30 1 
each from Canada31, Iran32 and Japan33) published between 2007 and 2015. 
Thirteen181922–2528–34 of the studies investigated the value of movement quality screening 
for athletes (including three182425 involving professional athletes and four22232930 involving 
National Collegiate Athletic Association athletes22232930; 2128 total participants; 1159 
males and 817 females), two2027 in the military (total male participants 3350) and two2126 in 
first responder trainees (total participants 1153; unable to distinguish by sex). 
Fourteen18–2024–34 of the studies are believed to have included male participants, while 
seven19222628293234 of the studies included female participants. Five2123–2530 of the studies 
did not specify participant sex however based on the sport or military group investigated in 
three242530 of these it is likely the participants were male. The age range of the athletes was 
11–25 years, military members 18–57 years and first responder trainees 11–22 years. One of 
the studies involving first responder trainees21 and three182425 with athletes did not report 
age range. Amongst the 17 studies, three202627 had a sample size greater than 500, 
five2023252930 had at least 50 injury cases (range 7–916 with three not reporting the number 
of injured participants) and four20272933 utilized a multivariable statistical approach to 
identify if movement quality outcomes could identify injury risk. Five2224252831 of the 17 
studies included a metric of diagnostic accuracy and no studies were identified that assessed 
the value of screening for movement quality on reducing the burden of LE injury.
Clinimetric Properties
Fifteen18–2729–33 of the 17 studies (88%) employed the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) 
to assess movement quality, while two2834 used the Lower Extremity Scoring System

 (LESS). Of those using the FMS only three222333 investigated the reliability of their 
measurement system while one34 of the investigations employing the LESS embedded an 
assessment of reliability into the study design. The most common reliability statistic 
estimated was an intraclass correlation coefficient with two2933 of the 17 studies including 
95% confidence intervals (CI). One33 study reported estimates of measurement precision.
Injury estimates
Descriptions of injury estimates (incidence proportion, incidence rate, prevalence), effect 
estimates (IRR, RR, OR) and significant and non-significant movement quality outcomes are 
presented in Table 1.
Quality and level of evidence
The highest level of evidence demonstrated by all reviewed studies was level 2b (cohort 
study) with the majority (13/17) of studies classified as level 4 which corresponds to low 
quality cohort study (n< 500, injury sample < 50, lack of multivariable analyses).
The median methodological quality for all 21 studies, based on the DB criteria, was 11/33 
(range 3–15) with only 9/17 scoring greater than 10. The aim of the DB criteria is to assess 
scientific study methodological quality (inclusive of randomized and non-randomized 
intervention as well as observational studies). As all of the included studies were 
observational in nature, 7 items (4, 8, 14, 19, 23, 24, and 27; totaling 10 points) on the DB 
checklist were not applicable. Areas in which the included studies were consistently limited 
included: incomplete description of how the sample was representative of the population of 
interest (e.g., insufficient description of participant characteristics such as sex, history of 
previous injury, training exposure); limited description of the characteristics of those lost to 
follow-up; insufficient reporting of how participants were lost to follow-up and differing 
length of follow-up were accounted for in statistical analyses; inadequate sample size; and 
lack of adjustment for potential modification and confounding by factors, such as exposure 
and previous injury. Of further note is the fact that two of the studies reported significant 
findings even though the 95%CI of the statistical estimate included a null value and that 
11/17 studies were published in non-indexed journals or in journals with an impact factor 
less than 2.
Synthesis of results
The quantity, quality and level of evidence for the most commonly investigated movement 
quality outcomes are summarized in Table 3. The most common risk factors investigated 
included age, FMS total score, FMS total score ≤14, FMS total score ≤12, FMS hurdle step, 
FMS in-line lunge, FMS deep squat, LESS total score and LESS total score ≥5. Based on 
this synthesis there is inconsistent evidence that poor movement quality is associated with 
increased risk of LE injury in sport and military/first-responder occupation.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review examining movement quality risk 
factors for LE injury in sport and military/first responder occupations that incorporates both

 a formal evaluation of study quality and level of evidence. Overall there is inconsistent level 
4 evidence that poor movement quality is a risk factor for LE injury in sport and military/
first-responder occupation populations. Accordingly, as the identification of risk factors is 
the first step in the injury prevention, it remains unknown if movement quality screening has 
a role in reducing the burden of LE injury in these populations.
It is important to highlight that the findings of this review are based upon a synthesis and 
evaluation of existing literature, and as such they are limited by the inadequacies of studies 
included. Overall there was a lack of consistent high quality evidence to support nominating 
any particular movement quality outcome as a risk factor due to inadequate reporting of 
concepts essential to establishing internal and external validity. The biggest threats to 
internal validity were related to the possibility of selection bias, and the reporting of, and 
adjustment for, potential confounding by factors such as sex, injury history and training 
exposure. Specifically, due to the lack of participant characteristic reporting it was often 
difficult to determine if the individuals selected for a study differed systematically from 
those in the source population. Equally important was the consistent omission of the 
characteristics of those lost to follow-up, which made it impossible to determine if 
participants lost to follow-up were systematically different from those retained in a study. 
The inability to determine selection bias not only questions the internal validity of several 
included studies, it impacts the degree to which the findings of these studies can be 
generalized to the larger population from which the samples were drawn (external validity).
As indicated earlier, it is highly unlikely that a LE injury is a result of a single risk factor or 
aberrant movement pattern, but rather the consequence of complex interactions between 
multiple risk factors and inciting events.7 Multivariable biostatistical techniques can explore 
these complex interactions given an adequate sample size. Bahr and Holme8 estimated that 
50 injury cases are needed to detect a moderate to strong association between a risk factor 
and injury. Of the 17 studies included in this review only four20272933 employed 
multivariable biostatistical techniques, of which only two2029 had 50 or more injury cases 
(with one27 not reporting the number of injury cases) and were able to assess the influence 
of additional covariates (e.g., body mass index, smoking status, muscular and cardiovascular 
fitness, battalion, previous injury history, sex, age and sport). As sex, previous injury, and 
exposure to training are known to influence the incidence of MSK LE injury the lack of 
reporting and assessment of the impact of these factors on the association between a pre-
season movement quality deficit and injury incidence with adequate sample size and 
biostatistical techniques brings into question the value of only assessing movement quality 
to establish injury risk.
It is important to consider that the true value of being able to identify risk factors for future 
injury is dependent upon it actually leading to strategies that result in injury reduction in real 
world contexts. This empirical validation requires an accumulation of high quality evidence 
indicating that an intervention program targeting those at high risk of injury based on a 
screening test is more beneficial than a non-targeted intervention.9 However before such a 
hypothesis can be tested there needs to be an accumulation of high quality evidence 
demonstrating a strong relationship between the risk factor, which was assessed with a valid 
and reliable screening test employing a specific cut-off value, and injury. Further, the

 predictive ability of the specific screening test cut-off value must be validated in multiple 
populations.9
To date, movement quality tests lack the foundation of rigorous development and validation 
(e.g. psychometrics) common in other fields35 and there is a lack of high quality evidence 
demonstrating a strong relationship between any single movement quality outcome and 
injury. As movement quality tests were not specifically developed as diagnostic tools, but 
rather to identify deficits that inform clinical interventions from a mechanistic perspective, 
this is perhaps not surprising.936 Although several cut-off points for high LE injury risk have 
been proposed (e.g., FMS total score ≤ 14,24 FMS total score ≤12,30 and LESS total score 
≥528), none appear to have sufficient diagnostic accuracy to be useful in real world contexts. 
For example the sensitivity and specificity of a FMS total score ≤14 has been shown be 
between 0.54–0.83 and 0.61–0.91 respectively.22242537 This suggests that almost half of 
individuals that go on to suffer a injury may not have a FMS total score ≤14 and over half of 
those that do not go on to suffer an injury may not have a FMS total score ≤14.
The ability to establish a link between poor movement quality and injury risk hold great 
potential for identifying modifiable causal mechanisms for injury, which can be addressed 
with a targeted intervention. For example the LESS aims to identify movement quality errors 
during jump-landing28 such as decreased hip flexion and knee valgus that have been 
associated with anterior cruciate ligament injury. In doing so provides a starting point for 
targeted interventions aimed at improving jump-landing mechanics and reducing an 
individual’s future ACL injury risk. However, the link between other movement quality 
outcomes that have an association with LE injury, such as reduced shoulder mobility19 or 
other FMS components, is not as intuitive. Without a theoretical basis linking the ‘non-
optimal movement’ to the injury, it would be difficult to know how to use the finding of an 
“abnormal” movement to guide an intervention aimed at reducing injury risk. This is a 
limitation of some movement quality outcomes that will have to be addressed prior to 
widespread application.
A final consideration is that this review was unable to identify any investigation that had 
assessed the value of screening for movement quality for reducing the burden of LE injury 
through targeted interventions in sport or military/first-responder occupation populations. 
With that said there are several examples of attempts to do this in the field of sport injury 
prevention using physical performance outcomes that can provide valuable guidance3839 
Specifically, these studies highlight the importance of developing an implementation 
strategy in conjunction with the intervention and then tracking and accounting for adherence 
to the prevention programs in the analysis.
Limitations
Meta-analyses were not possible due to the fact that the assumptions for meta-analyses were 
not satisfied by the included studies. In particular, there was considerable inconsistency in 
methodology (e.g., reporting and controlling for confounding) and heterogeneity of injury 
definition. For example, the injury definition covered the span of ‘a MSK injury resulting 
from organized intercollegiate sport practice or competition that required medical attention 
or advice from a certified athletic trainer, athletic training student or physician’22 to ‘a MSK 
Whittaker et al.

 injury that occurred during participation in track and field practice or competition that 
prevented participation for 4 weeks’33. This inconsistency in injury definition led to injury 
estimates ranging from 0.8 % to 85% of participants across the included studies. Further, 
despite a comprehensive search strategy and rigorous approach to study selection, it is 
important to acknowledge the possibility of omitting a relevant study and inclusion of only 
English language articles as additional potential limitations. Finally, as the findings of this 
review are based upon a synthesis and evaluation of existing literature it is important to point 
out that the current evidence base of studies that have assessed the prospective relationship 
between poor movement quality and LE injury may not have considered all possible 
movement quality screening tests (e.g., Nine Battery Test,40 Performance Matrix,41 Single 
Leg Squat,42–44 Tuck Jump Assessment and Star Excursion Balance Test45).
Recommendations
Both cohort and intervention study designs can play an important role in identifying 
potential risk factors and reducing the burden of LE injury in sport and military/first-
responder occupations.89 While cohort studies are critical for establishing temporality 
between a risk factor and subsequent injury, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide the 
strongest evidence for the causal nature of a risk factor and the effectiveness of modifying 
that factor on injury burden. Based upon the studies reviewed it is recommended that future 
research focus on high quality cohort studies aimed at identifying the most relevant 
movement quality outcomes for predicting injury followed by establishing the diagnostic 
accuracy of the movement quality screening tests used to assess these risk factors in relevant 
populations. Given the challenges and high cost of undertaking high quality cohort studies, 
an alternative approach may be to simultaneously develop and evaluate pre-participation 
screening and LE injury prevention programs through high quality RCT’s targeting athletes 
or workers at greater risk of injury based upon previous injury. Further recommendations 
include; ensuring consistency in injury definition amongst studies attempting to determine 
the relationship between a movement quality outcome and subsequent injury that aligns with 
international consensus46 and the development of movement quality screening tools 
according to psychometric principles.35 Implementation of these recommendations will 
assist in the advancement of injury prediction and prevention.
CONCLUSIONS
Based on the findings of this systematic review it is recommended future research focus on 
high quality cohort studies to identify the most relevant movement quality outcomes for 
predicting injury. This should be followed by development and evaluation of pre-
participation screening and LE injury prevention programs through high quality randomized 
controlled trials targeting athletes or workers at greater risk of injury based upon 
psychometrically sound movement screening tests.

 WHAT ARE THE NEW FINDINGS
•
There is conflicting level 4 evidence that movement quality outcomes are risk 
factors for lower extremity injury in sport and military/first-responder 
occupation populations.
•
There is a need for consistency in injury definition amongst studies 
attempting to determine the relationship between a movement quality 
outcome and subsequent injury.
•
Based on the work done in the field it is recommended that investigators focus 
on high quality cohort studies to identify the most relevant movement quality 
outcomes for predicting injury risk that account for the multifactorial nature 
of injury by ensuring adequate sample size and employing relevant 
biostatistical techniques.
