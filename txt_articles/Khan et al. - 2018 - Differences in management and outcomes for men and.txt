The known Sex differences in the management and outcomes
of patients with acute coronary syndromes have been
reported, but many reported analyses were not adjusted for
confounding covariates.
The new Despite broader awareness of STEMI protocols,
revascularisation rates for women with STEMI are lower than
for men. In hospital, rates of major adverse cardiovascular
events and mortality were similar, but at 6 months were
significantly higher for women. Women were less frequently
referred for cardiac rehabilitation or prescribed preventive
medications on discharge.
The implications Clinicians should consider potential barriers
to equity for women in the management of STEMI.
C
ardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in both sexes, but an extensive literature
has described differences between men and women in
clinical presentation and pathophysiology that may influence
management and outcomes.1,2 Observational studies have found
that
women with acute coronary syndromes
(ACS) more
frequently present with atypical symptoms,3 with more comor-
bidities,4 and at an older age, and that plaque rupture5 and high
risk features3,6,7 are less likely to be identified during angiog-
raphy than in men.
Large hospital registry studies have found that women with ACS
are less likely to receive evidence-based management, including
coronary angiography and appropriate medications in hospital
and at discharge.4,6,8-10 Australian data similarly indicate that
women with ACS are underinvestigated and that evidence-based
therapies are less often prescribed than for male patients.10-12
Some studies have found that the higher mortality rates for women
than for men with ACS in hospital,4,6,9,10,13 at 30 days,7,14 and at
6 months3,13 are attenuated after adjusting for age and comorbid
conditions, but others have found that differences persist despite
adjustment.8
In our investigation, we wanted to avoid confounding by the sig-
nificant interactions between sex and type of ACS identified in
earlier studies.7,14 We therefore focused on patients with STEMI, as
the clinical presentation and diagnosis of this condition is relatively
consistent and the patients receive a largely standardised man-
agement plan. We hypothesised that management and outcomes
for men and women with STEMI should be similar after adjusting
for risk level.
Our specific aims were to identify sex differences in the charac-
teristics and outcomes of patients presenting with STEMI; to
examine associations between sex and outcomes (morbidity and
mortality) after adjusting for relevant covariates; and to explore
whether there with differences in the prescribing of preventive
medications for men and women after STEMI.
Methods
We analysed data from the CONCORDANCE (Cooperative
National Registry of Acute Coronary care, Guideline Adherence
and Clinical Events) registry, an ongoing prospective ACS registry
Abstract
Objective: To examine whether there are sex differences in the
characteristics, management, and clinical outcomes of patients
with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
Design, setting: Cohort study; analysis of data collected
prospectively by the CONCORDANCE acute coronary syndrome
registry from 41 Australian hospitals between February 2009 and
May 2016.
Participants: 2898 patients (2183 men, 715 women) with
STEMI.
Main outcome measures: Rates of revascularisation
(percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI], thrombolysis,
coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]), adjusted for GRACE
risk score quartile. Secondary outcomes: timely vascularisation
rates; major adverse cardiac event rates; clinical outcomes and
preventive treatments at discharge.
Results: The mean age of women with STEMI at presentation
was 66.6 years (SD, 14.5 years), of men, 60.5 years (SD, 12.5
years). The proportions of women with hypertension, diabetes,
prior stroke, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, or
dementia were larger than those of men; fewer women had
histories of previous coronary artery disease or myocardial
infarction, or of prior PCI or CABG. Women were less likely to
have undergone coronary angiography (odds ratio, adjusted for
GRACE score quartile [aOR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41e0.69) or
revascularisation (aOR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.34e0.52); they were less
likely to have received timely revascularisation (aOR, 0.72;
95% CI, 0.63e0.83) or primary PCI (aOR, 0.76; 95% CI,
0.61e0.95). Six months after admission, the rates of major
adverse cardiovascular events (aOR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.76e4.09)
and mortality (aOR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.24e3.80) were higher for
women. At discharge, significantly fewer women than men
received b-blockers, statins, and referrals to cardiac
rehabilitation.
Conclusion: Women with STEMI are less likely to receive
invasive management, revascularisation, or preventive
medication at discharge. The reasons for these persistent
differences in care require investigation.

 involving 41 sites around Australia that has enrolled patients since
February 2009. The cohort for the current analysis was enrolled
between February 2009 and May 2016. Details of the design and
rationale of CONCORDANCE have been published elsewhere,15
and are described only briefly here.
Setting and participants
Hospitals from all Australian states and territories participated.
Twenty-eight hospitals (68%) are in metropolitan regions, 13 in
rural locations; 30 (73%) have onsite cardiac catheterisation labo-
ratories. All ACS patients can be enrolled, but most hospitals select
a representative sample, usually enrolling the first ten adult pa-
tients (at least 18 years of age) admitted with suspected ACS each
calendar month. An opt-out consent process was applied and
consent waiver approved for patients who died or were too ill to
provide consent.15 Patients included in the analysis reported in this
article were those with a final discharge diagnosis of STEMI.
Data collection
Patient characteristics, treatments and medical history at presen-
tation,
initial
assessment
and
management,
in-hospital
in-
vestigations and management, and in-hospital morbidity and
mortality are collected in a standardised electronic case report
form. To ensure data quality, a random sample of submitted case
report forms was audited. Patients undergoing percutaneous cor-
onary intervention (PCI) were categorised as receiving either
“primary PCI” or “other PCI”. The Global Registry of Acute Cor-
onary Events (GRACE) risk score was calculated for all patients.
The GRACE risk score is a validated clinical risk prediction tool for
estimating the cumulative 6-month risks of death and of death or
myocardial infarction on the basis of eight factors: age, pulse rate,
Killip class, systolic blood pressure, initial serum creatinine level,
initial cardiac enzyme levels, cardiac arrest at admission, and ST
segment deviation.16
The primary outcome was total revascularisation, a composite
endpoint encompassing patients receiving PCI, thrombolysis, or
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during the index admis-
sion. We chose this outcome because delay in diagnosis or treat-
ment is often
cited as a cause of sex differences. Total
revascularisation better captures whether the principal goal of
revascularisation therapy was achieved in STEMI patients than
assessing the rates of individual therapies.
Important secondary outcomes were also assessed:
�
the components of the primary outcome: any PCI, primary
PCI, thrombolysis, CABG;
�
timely revascularisation, defined as patients presenting to
hospital within 12 hours of symptom onset receiving primary
PCI with a door-to-balloon time of no more than 90 minutes or
thrombolysis with a door-to-needle time of no more than 30
minutes;
�
major adverse cardiac events, a composite endpoint including
myocardial re-infarction, and stroke or death with a cardiac
cause;
�
mortality in hospital and within 6 months of admission.
In patients discharged alive, we also examined discharge medica-
tions and referral to cardiac rehabilitation.
Statistical analysis
Simple group comparisons employed c2 tests for categorical vari-
ables and Student t tests for continuous variables, adjusted for
clustering. For categorical univariate analysis of outcomes with
more than two levels, we used the RaoeScott c2 test. P < 0.05 was
deemed statistically significant.
We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes for men and
women. Associations between sex and each outcome were
examined in univariate and multivariate logistic regression
models using the generalised estimation equation framework.
Multivariate models, adjusted for the GRACE risk score (cat-
egorised as quartiles), were calculated for each of the outcomes:
revascularisation, discharge medication, cardiac rehabilitation
referral, mortality. In each model, we tested for interactions be-
tween each variable and sex, and adjusted for clustering. Several
sensitivity analyses were undertaken: adjusting for time to pre-
sentation (defined as time between symptom onset and time of
presentation to first hospital) as well as GRACE risk score for
revascularisation therapies and clinical outcomes; comparing the
primary outcome stratified by GRACE risk score or by year of
index admission; restricting analyses of revascularisation thera-
pies to hospitals able to perform PCI; restricting analysis of pri-
mary PCI rates to patients with significant coronary artery
disease. All analyses were performed in SAS University Edition
(SAS Institute).
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the Sydney Local Health District
Human Research Ethics Committee (reference, CH62/6/2008-
141). The CONCORDANCE registry was approved by the
research and ethics committees at all participating sites.
Results
Of 10 656 people enrolled in the CONCORDANCE registry at 31
May 2016, 2898 (27.5%) had a final diagnosis of STEMI; 2183
(75.3%) were men, 715 (24.7%) women. In-hospital clinical
outcome data were complete for all patients, and also for 2075 of
2627 patients (79.0%) eligible for follow-up at 6 months. GRACE
risk scores could be calculated for 2790 of 2898 patients (96.3%)
(2103 of 2183 men; 687 of 715 women). The mean age of women
with STEMI at presentation was higher (66.6 years; standard de-
viation [SD], 14.5 years; men, 60.5 years; SD, 12.5 years), as was
their mean GRACE score (123.5; SD, 33.3; men, 111.4; SD 30.0).
Further, a larger proportion of women than of men had hyper-
tension, diabetes, a history of prior stroke, chronic kidney disease,
chronic heart failure, or dementia; fewer had a history of previous
coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction, or of prior PCI or
CABG (Box 1).
Women with STEMI were less likely to have undergone coronary
angiography (odds ratio, adjusted for GRACE score quartile
[aOR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41e0.69) or received
revascularisation (aOR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.34e0.52); they were less
likely to have received timely revascularisation (aOR, 0.72;
95% CI, 0.63e0.83) or primary PCI (aOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61e0.95).
Rates of thrombolysis were similar for men and women, but in the
subset of cases with data on timeliness, the maximum door-to-
needle time of 30 minutes was less often met for women than
men (29% v 37%); there was no difference in door-to-balloon times
for primary PCI (50% v 52%) (Box 2). Overall rates of total
revascularisation for both men and women improved during
2010e2015, but there was still a significant sex difference (online
Appendix, table 1).
Women had higher rates of non-significant coronary artery disease
(12.1% v 3.7%) and lower rates of two-vessel disease (24.7% v

 29.7%) than men, but similar rates of single- and three-vessel cor-
onary artery disease and of anterior STEMI (women, 51.0%; men,
51.8%) detected by coronary angiography (online Appendix,
figure 1).
All sensitivity analyses yielded similar results to the main anal-
ysis, including after adjusting for time to presentation as well as
for GRACE risk score (online Appendix, table 2), stratifying by
GRACE risk score quartile (online Appendix, table 3), and
restricting analysis to hospitals that were PCI-capable (online
Appendix, table 4). In the analysis restricted to patients with
significant coronary artery disease, the total revascularisation
rate for women was lower than for men with STEMI (90.0% v
95.1%).
In hospital, women were more likely to have second or third degree
atrioventricular block (aOR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.08e3.00), and less
likely to experience in-hospital cardiac arrest (aOR, 0.70; 95% CI,
0.51e0.96) or sustained ventricular tachycardia (aOR, 0.47; 95% CI,
0.26e0.83). Rates of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events and
mortality were higher for women, but the differences were not
statistically significant after adjusting for GRACE risk score quar-
tile; however, at 6 months their major adverse cardiac event rate
(aOR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.76e4.09) and mortality (aOR, 2.17; 95% CI,
1.24e3.80) were higher than for men after adjusting for GRACE
risk score quartile (Box 3). These differences in clinical outcomes
were similar after adjusting for time to presentation as well as for
GRACE score quartile (online Appendix, table 5).
At discharge, significantly lower proportions of women than of
men received b-blockers, statins, and referrals to cardiac rehabili-
tation, but there were no sex differences for receiving second an-
tiplatelet agents, aspirin, or angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (Box 4).
Discussion
In our analysis of Australian ACS registry data, we found that
the mean age of women presenting to hospital with STEMI
was higher than for male patients, as was their mean GRACE
risk score. Nevertheless, smaller proportions of women than
men with STEMI had undergone coronary angiography or
revascularisation; 6 months after admission, they were more
likely to have had a major adverse cardiac event, and their
mortality rate was higher. The lower overall revascularisation
rate in women was explained by lower rates of primary PCI
and CABG, as there was no sex difference for thrombolysis.
These differences persisted even after adjusting for both time

in
analyses
restricted to patients with significant obstructive coronary ar-
tery disease, and in analyses restricted to PCI-capable hospi-
tals. Our findings of lower rates of revascularisation of women
than of men with STEMI are consistent with those of an
analysis of Victorian ACS registry data; mortality in the
Victorian study, however, was similar for men and women.11,12
Further, women with STEMI in our study were less likely to
receive some elements of secondary preventive treatment,
including b-blockers
and
statins,
and
referral
to
cardiac
rehabilitation.
The characteristics of the patients in our study are comparable
with those of other Australian and international studies that have
found that women present with ACS later in life than men, and
have
more
comorbid
conditions,
especially
diabetes
and
hypertension;3,4,8,9,11,13,17-21 several of these studies also found
that women were less likely to undergo invasive coronary angi-
ography and revascularisation.4,9,11,13,17,18 Three studies have
reported rates of primary PCI in patients with STEMI. Registry
data analyses in Switzerland (12 146 patients) and France (3510
patients) each found that primary PCI rates were lower for
women than men with STEMI (30.9% v 40.3% and 47% v
55% respectively).4,21 The lower rates of primary PCI in the Swiss
registry (AMIS) study than in ours (women, 42.8%; men, 52.3%)
are probably explained by the period of enrolment (AMIS,
1997e2006; CONCORDANCE, since 2009). A study by the
Malaysian National Cardiovascular DiseaseeAcute Coronary
Syndrome Registry (6378 patients) found much lower rates of
primary PCI (women, 6.2%; men, 6.7%), and the rates of throm-
bolysis were also lower for women (64.4%; men, 74.6%).9 It is not
clear whether these differences in management are associated
with poorer clinical outcomes for women; some registries from
middle (upper and lower) and high income countries have found
no sex difference in adjusted rates of in-hospital mortal-
ity.4,9,13,17,18 An analysis of data in the Global Registry of Acute

 Coronary Events (14 Western countries; 26 755 patients) found
higher adjusted 6-month major adverse cardiac event rates, but
not higher mortality among women than men.3
The reasons for the persisting differences in the investigation and
management of men and women in Australian hospitals are per-
plexing. By restricting our analyses to patients with STEMI, we
minimised the effects of differences in management caused by type
of ACS and level of risk. We found that women with STEMI in
every GRACE risk score quartile received less comprehensive
assessment and treatment. Current guidelines support invasive
management of patients at high risk, while acknowledging that
this increases the risk of complications.22 Undertreatment of pa-
tients with a high risk score has been a consistent feature of ACS
management in several studies.23 Undertreatment in the popula-
tion we examined might be caused by poor awareness that women
with STEMI are generally at higher risk, or by a preference for
subjectively determining risk rather than applying more reliable,
objective risk prediction tools.24
The similar rates of in-hospital mortality in our study may reflect
insufficient statistical power for detecting a sex difference at this
time point. Differences in revascularisation rates in hospital may
underlie the statistically significant differences in major adverse
cardiac event rate and mortality at 6 months.
Treatment protocols for patients with STEMI have improved in
Australia, and we found that overall rates of total revascularisation

 have increased since 2010. Nevertheless, sex differences persist.
More detailed qualitative evaluation of the reasons for these dif-
ferences is needed to understand whether variances in manage-
ment are justified, or whether strategies are needed to redress the
imbalances.
Limitations
The strength of our study is that we examined data from 41 diverse
centres across Australia, collected detailed information on the
baseline characteristics of patients, and analysed prospectively
collected data on clinical outcomes. There were nevertheless some
limitations. First, senior hospital staff at participating hospitals
were provided with real time electronic reports of key performance
indicators of the effectiveness of their systems of care, and they
could use this feedback to correct management deficits,
meaning that these centres would not be representative
of non-participating centres. However, in this case we
will probably have underestimated differences in man-
agement and outcomes for men and women with
STEMI. Second, follow-up to 6 months was not complete
(80%), which may limit our ability to draw conclusions
about outcomes at this point. This level of participation
is, however, typical for an ongoing clinical quality reg-
istry study, and is comparable with those of large in-
ternational ACS registries.25 Further, there were no
significant differences in the baseline characteristics of
patients who were or were not followed up (online
Appendix, table 7).
Conclusion
We found that both risk levels and outcomes for patients
with STEMI in Australia are different for men and
women. The mean GRACE risk score at admission was
higher for women, and at every level of GRACE risk,
women were less likely than men to receive invasive
management and revascularisation. Women were also
less likely to be prescribed preventive medicines after
discharge, and had higher rates of major adverse cardiac events at
6 months. These differences do not seem medically justified. Future
research should identify why they persist, the influences on deci-
sion making by health providers and health services that cause
these differences, and strategies for redressing the disparities in
treatment.
