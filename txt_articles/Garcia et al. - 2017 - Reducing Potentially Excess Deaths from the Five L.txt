Background
In 2014, the all-cause age-adjusted death rate in the United 
States reached a historic low of 724.6 per 100,000 population 
(1). However, mortality in rural (nonmetropolitan) areas of the 
United States has decreased at a much slower pace, resulting 
in a widening gap between rural mortality rates (830.5) and 
urban mortality rates (704.3) (1). During 1999–2014, annual 
age-adjusted death rates for the five leading causes of death 
in the United States (heart disease, cancer, unintentional 
injury, chronic lower respiratory disease [CLRD], and stroke) 
were higher in rural areas than in urban (metropolitan) areas 
(Figure 1). In most public health regions (Figure 2), the 
proportion of deaths among persons aged <80 years (U.S. 
average life expectancy) (2) from the five leading causes 
that were potentially excess deaths were higher in rural areas 
compared with urban areas (Figure 3). Several factors probably 
influence the rural-urban gap in potentially excess deaths 
from the five leading causes, many of which are associated 
with sociodemographic differences between rural and urban 
areas. Residents of rural areas in the United States tend to be 
older, poorer, and sicker than their urban counterparts (3). A 
higher proportion of the rural U.S. population reports limited 
physical activity because of chronic conditions than urban 
populations (4). Moreover, social circumstances and behaviors 
have an impact on mortality and potentially contribute to 
approximately half of the determining causes of potentially 
excess deaths (5).
Potentially excess deaths (also described as potentially 
preventable deaths) are defined as deaths among persons aged 
<80 years in excess of the number that would be expected 
if the death rates for each cause were equivalent across all 
states to those that occurred among the three states with the 
lowest rates (6,7). Although not all potentially excess deaths 
can be prevented, many might represent deaths that could 
be prevented through improved public health programs that 
support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods and better 
access to health care services.
Reducing Potentially Excess Deaths 
in Rural Areas of the United States
In 2014, approximately 62% of all 1,622,304 deaths in the 
United States were related to the five leading causes of death 
(6). During 2014, the number of potentially excess deaths 
from the five leading causes in rural areas was higher than those 
in urban areas (8). Targeted, needs-based prevention efforts, 
combined with improved access to treatment for chronic 
conditions, might reduce the rural-urban gap in age-adjusted 
death rates and potentially excess deaths from the five leading 
causes of death.
Heart Disease, Stroke, and Chronic Lower 
Respiratory Disease
Heart disease, stroke, and CLRD share several substantial 
co-morbidities from individual behavioral and social risk 
factors (9–12). The percentage of potentially excess deaths 
from these three causes is higher in rural than urban areas in 
all 10 regions (8). In addition, potentially excess deaths among 
regions vary substantially. For example, the percentages of 
excess deaths in urban areas in regions 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 related 
to stroke are higher than even the rural area percentages in 
regions 1, 2, 8, 9, and 10. For these three causes of potentially 
excess deaths, the highest urban percent in one or more regions 
is higher than the lowest rural percentages in three or more 
regions. Stroke is the most prominent example: urban excess 
deaths in regions 4 (South East) and 6 (New Mexico, Texas, 
Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana) far outpace rural excess 
deaths in regions 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10. In region 5 (Great

Lakes), rural-urban differences in potentially excess deaths 
nearly disappeared for heart disease and stroke. Additional 
research is needed to understand the causes of these differences 
and what can be learned from both the broad regional 
differences across the United States and the near elimination 
of rural-urban differences in the Great Lakes region.
Tobacco use increases the risk for developing and dying from 
heart disease, stroke, and CLRD. Cigarette smoking is the leading 
cause of preventable disease and death in the United States (13) 
and is the most substantive risk factor for CLRD (10). Nationally, 
the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults living in rural 
counties is higher than in urban counties, and smoking rates 
differ markedly by region, making tobacco use a likely leading

cause of differential mortality between urban and rural areas (4). 
Understanding where tobacco use in rural areas is higher than 
urban areas can help prioritize resources to reduce tobacco use and 
secondhand smoke exposure and begin to address the increasing 
numbers of CLRD-related deaths in rural areas.
Heart disease and stroke mortality rates are decreasing 
in both rural and urban areas. However, this improvement 
in mortality trends is plateauing and the rate of decline for 
heart disease in rural areas is slowing relative to urban areas, 
thus increasing the differential rural-urban gap in mortality 
rates (8). In 22 states, including rural states such as Alaska, 
Idaho, Kentucky, Montana, Vermont and West Virginia, the 
number of deaths attributed to heart disease declined below 
the number of cancer deaths for the first time (8). For stroke, 
the difference in the number of deaths in rural and urban areas 
remained constant, with substantive declines in both rural 
and urban areas (8). In 2013, stroke declined from the third 
to the fifth leading cause of death in nonmetropolitan areas 
(14). Lack of physical activity, poor nutrition (especially diets 
high in calories, sodium, added sugars, and saturated fat), and 
associated obesity are major risk factors for hypertension and 
diabetes (15). These risk factors and conditions contribute 
substantially to heart disease and stroke death rates in the 
United States and are more prevalent in rural areas than urban 
areas. Obesity has been linked to a variety of serious chronic

illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and arthritis 
(16–18). From 1960 to 2010, the proportion of adults in the 
United States who were overweight or obese increased from 
40.5% to 66.1% (19). Self-reported obesity was higher in rural 
areas than urban areas and increased with increasing levels of 
rurality (4). Regular physical activity and improved physical 
fitness offer numerous health benefits, including reduced risk 
for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, some cancers, and 
musculoskeletal conditions (20). Despite evidence of modest 
increases in the prevalence of physical activity and improved 
nutrition, the prevalence rates of hypertension and diabetes 
have not been improving over time (21,22). However, a greater 
percentage of adults with hypertension are controlling their 
blood pressure (23), and since 2006 there has been a sustained 
decline in the incidence of diabetes and a plateauing in the 
prevalence of diabetes nationally (24).
Barriers to health care access result in unmet health care 
needs that include, but are not limited to, a lack of preventive 
and screening services, treatment of illnesses (25) and timely 
urgent and emergency services (26). Residents of rural areas 
experience many of these barriers. Specifically, rural counties in 
the United States have a higher uninsured rate (27); experience 
health care workforce shortages (approximately only 11 percent 
of all physicians choose to practice in rural settings) (28); often 
lack subspecialty care (e.g., oncology), critical care units, or 
emergency facilities (29); have limited transportation options; 
and experience longer time to services caused by distance (26). 
Differential access to quality health care (25), including timely 
access, likely contributes to rural-urban gaps in mortality 
rates and potentially excess deaths. For example, persons 
with CLRD and unmet health care needs in rural areas can 
experience serious life-threatening respiratory episodes, and the 
lack of timely access to emergency care could affect survival. 
In contrast, the parallel mortality trends for stroke might be 
explained by the success of complementary programs that 
improve the quality of stroke care. These programs (CDC’s 
Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program, the American 
Heart Association/American Stroke Association’s Get with the 
Guidelines program, and The Joint Commission’s Certification 
for Primary Stroke Centers program) organize systems that 
coordinate acute stroke care across both urban and rural 
hospitals (30). However, comparable programs to improve 
cardiac care have not been implemented in rural areas, which 
might account for divergent trend in myocardial infarction 
mortality rates.
Cancer
During 2003–2012, the overall cancer-related age-adjusted 
death rate decreased by 1.5% per year (31); however, rates

declined less in rural than urban areas (8). Age-adjusted death 
rates from cancer have mirrored decreases in the prevalence of 
risk factors such as tobacco use, which is a shared risk factor 
with heart disease, stroke, and CLRD (10–12), and increases 
in cancer screening, vaccinations, and improvements in 
treatment (31). Differences in these death rates might reflect 
higher prevalence of tobacco-use and obesity in rural areas 
(4) and lack of access to cancer screening services, follow-up 
to abnormal tests, quality care for cancer patients, and cancer 
survival care (32).
To address the rural-urban gap in cancer-related potentially 
excess deaths, comprehensive approaches that encompass the 
cancer continuum (e.g., prevention, early detection, treatment, 
and survivorship) are needed at the local and state level to 
reduce risks associated with potentially excess deaths from 
cancer in rural areas (33). Comprehensive cancer-control 
programs are funded by CDC in 50 states, the District of 
Columbia, seven tribes and tribal organizations, and seven 
U.S. territories and Pacific Island jurisdictions (https://www.
cdc.gov/cancer/ncccp/about.htm). These programs build 
coalitions that develop and implement strategic plans for cancer 
prevention and reduce morbidity and mortality for persons 
affected by cancer.
CDC also supports cancer screening programs that 
address health disparities among adults who are uninsured 
or underinsured (34,35), which is a common characteristic 
among rural populations (32). Historically, funding for the 
National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program 
and the Colorectal Cancer Control Program has focused on 
direct screening services. Since 2012, emphasis has shifted to 
population-based approaches, such as partnering with health 
systems to implement evidence-based interventions to increase 
population-level screening (36), including provider reminders 
for persons who are due for cancer screening (37).
As differences in cancer-related death rates are addressed at 
the local and state level, opportunities are available to address 
them at the federal level. The Cancer Moonshot is focused on 
accelerating the understanding of cancer and its prevention, 
early detection, treatment, and cure, including improving 
access and care (38). Although some components of this 
federal initiative target the genomic level, when combined 
with population-based approaches, the rural-urban gap in 
cancer-related deaths rates might be reduced.
Unintentional Injury
During 2008–2010, the annual age-adjusted death rates for 
unintentional injury were highest in rural counties (8). During 
1999–2014, the age-adjusted death rates for unintentional 
injuries were approximately 50% higher in rural areas than 
urban areas (Figure 1). Several factors explain the wide gap 
in rural-urban death rates from unintentional injuries. First, 
unintentional injury burden is higher in rural areas because of 
severe trauma associated with high speed motor vehicle traffic-
related deaths (4). Second, rates of opioid analgesic misuse and 
overdose death are highest among poor and rural populations 
(39). Third, behavioral factors (e.g., alcohol impaired driving, 
seatbelt use, and opioid prescribing) contribute to higher injury 
rates in rural areas (40–42). Fourth, access to treatment for 
trauma and drug poisoning is often delayed when the injury 
occurs in rural areas. For life-threatening injury, higher survival 
is associated with rapid emergency treatment (43,44). Because 
of the geographic distance involved, emergency medical service 
(EMS) providers who operate ambulances take longer to 
reach injured or poisoned patients in rural areas. Moreover, 
ambulatory transport to the optimal treatment facility also 
can take longer because of increased distance to the treatment 
facility. Most life threatening trauma is best treated in advanced 
trauma centers, which are usually located in urban areas; care 
at these centers has been associated with 25% lower mortality 
(45). Trauma centers have advanced equipment and specialized 
staff available 24 hours, 7 days a week. Such care also includes 
access to advanced neurosurgical care, which is important 
because approximately one third of all injury-related deaths 
involve a traumatic brain injury. Regulatory restrictions and 
EMS capability and certification to treat drug overdose cases 
with naloxone at the scene of overdose events also might be a 
factor in higher opioid poisoning-related deaths in rural areas.
Interventions to address the disproportionate unintentional 
injury death rates in rural areas include increased adherence to 
guidelines for triaging ambulatory transport destinations (46), 
changing state rules to expand the types of EMS providers 
that can administer naloxone to reverse a drug overdose (47), 
and enforcement of motor vehicle seatbelt and alcohol laws 
to reduce motor vehicle crashes (48). Educating rural opioid 
prescribers on the opioid guideline (49) and better access 
to opioid agonist medication-assisted treatment programs 
probably would benefit rural communities with high opioid 
use disorder rates (50). Quicker access to definitive trauma and 
opioid dependency treatment and additional interventions are 
needed to reduce unintentional injury deaths in rural areas.
Conclusion
In the United States, there is a rural-urban gap in age-
adjusted death rates and potentially excess deaths from the five 
leading causes of death. Rural communities experience higher 
age-adjusted death rates and a higher number of potentially 
excess deaths from the five leading causes compared with urban

areas. Higher death rates and potentially excess deaths are often 
associated with various societal, geographic, behavioral, and 
structural factors. Historic trends indicate that focusing on 
access to health care in rural areas of the United States alone is 
not sufficient to adequately address complex health outcomes, 
including mortality among rural populations (3). Consistent 
with the recommendations and best practices described in this 
report, approaches to address the nonuniform achievements in 
rural areas must focus on strengthening the health care delivery 
system while improving and increasing the integration of 
primary, specialty, and substance abuse services (3). Identifying 
structural and societal modifiable factors contributing to the 
gap between rural and urban mortality outcomes from the five 
leading causes of death is challenging. Additional analysis can 
yield results that inform the strategic alignment of resources 
with condition-specific needs. To reverse the widening gap in 
age-adjusted death rates from unintentional injuries between 
rural and urban areas, special attention should be given to 
designing, implementing, and monitoring locally informed 
initiatives in rural communities for the effective prevention 
and treatment of opioid misuse, including treatment of opioid 
overdose. Needs-based allocation of resources can substantially 
impact rural health. Although rural communities are at higher 
risk for death from the five leading causes of death, funding to 
address risk factors is allocated on a population basis (3), often 
resulting in underfunded rural programs. An increased emphasis 
on need and epidemiologic burden of disease as major factors 
in targeting future allocation of public health and prevention 
funding might contribute, among other factors, to bridging the 
mortality gap from the five leading causes of death between rural 
and urban areas in the United States.
