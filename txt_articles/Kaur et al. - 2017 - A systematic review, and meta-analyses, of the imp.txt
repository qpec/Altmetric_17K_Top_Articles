Abstract
Background: Health-related claims are statements regarding the nutritional content of a food (nutrition claims)
and/or indicate that a relationship exists between a food and a health outcome (health claims). Their impact on
food purchasing or consumption decisions is unclear. This systematic review measured the effect of health-related
claims, on pre-packaged foods in retail settings, on adult purchasing decisions (real and perceived).
Methods: In September 2016, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CAB abstracts, Business Source Complete,
and Web of Science/Science Citation Index & Social Science Citation Index for articles in English published in peer-
review journals. Studies were included if they were controlled experiments where the experimental group(s) included
a health-related claim and the control group involved an identical product without a health-related claim. Included
studies measured (at an individual or population level); actual or intended choice, purchases, and/or consumption. The
primary outcome was product choices and purchases, the secondary outcome was food consumption and
preference. Results were standardised through calculating odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for
the likelihood of choosing a product when a health-related claim was present. Results were combined in a
random-effects meta-analysis.
Results: Thirty-one papers were identified, 17 of which were included for meta-analyses. Most studies were
conducted in Europe (n = 17) and the USA (n = 7). Identified studies were choice experiments that measured
the likelihood of a product being chosen when a claim was present compared to when a claim was not
present, (n = 16), 15 studies were experiments that measured either; intent-rating scale outcomes (n = 8),
consumption (n = 6), a combination of the two (n = 1), or purchase data (n = 1). Overall, 20 studies found
that claims increase purchasing and/or consumption, eight studies had mixed results, and two studies found
consumption/purchasing reductions. The meta-analyses of 17 studies found that health-related claims increase
consumption and/or purchasing (OR 1.75, CI 1.60–1.91).
Conclusion: Health-related claims have a substantial effect on dietary choices. However, this finding is based
on research mostly conducted in artificial settings. Findings from natural experiments have yielded smaller
effects. Further research is needed to assess effects of claims in real-world settings.

 Background
Poor diet is a leading cause of ill health. It has been
estimated that 11.3 million deaths a year worldwide are
attributable to dietary risk factors [1]. The World
Health Organization recommends that adults consume
at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, re-
strict their fat intake to 30% of the total energy intake,
saturated fat to 10%, and free sugars to 5% of the total
energy intake, and limit their salt intake to less than 5 g
a day [2].
In order to address the burden of a poor diet food la-
bels can be used to provide nutrition information to the
consumer. People who read the nutrition information on
food labels tend to have a healthier diet; however some
consumers find the information difficult to understand
and/or interpret [3]. Consumers would benefit from
more interpretative aids to simplify the information pro-
vided on food labelling [3, 4].
Health and nutrition claims could potentially be used
as interpretative aids. A health claim is ‘any claim which
states, suggests or implies that a relationship exists
between a food category, a food or one of its constitu-
ents and health’ [5]. Whereas a nutrition claim is ‘any
claim that states, suggests or implies that a food has par-
ticular beneficial nutritional properties due to the en-
ergy, nutrients or other substances it contains, contains
in reduced or increased proportions or does not contain’
[5]. It has been estimated that within Europe approxi-
mately 26% of pre-packaged foods carry a health or nu-
trition claim [6].
Health and nutrition claims (henceforth referred to as
‘health-related claims’) may help consumers identify
healthier products if they are used responsibly [7, 8].
However, they also have considerable potential to mis-
lead consumers [9, 10]. For example, consumers may at-
tribute excessive health benefits to consuming a food
with a claim (‘magic bullet’ effect) [11, 12]. They may in-
correctly perceive a product carrying a health-related
claim more positively than a product without a claim
(positivity bias). Finally, they may incorrectly ascribe the
product with positive attributes unrelated to the claim
(‘heath halo’ effect) [13].
There is some contention on the effect of health-related
claims on dietary choices. There is some evidence that
health-related claims may increase consumption for ex-
ample Wansink and Chandon (2006) [14] found that
participants ate more of a snack food when it was de-
scribed as ‘low fat’. However, other studies have found that
health-related claims reduce consumptions as they lower
consumers’ taste expectations [15, 16].
A variety of methods have been used to study the ef-
fect of health-related claims. Early research into the ef-
fects of health-related claims on dietary choices looked
at the sales of products before and after a claim was
introduced. For example, a number of studies examined
population sales data of breakfast oats before and after a
health claim was used and found that sales increased
once a health-related claim was added to the packaging
[17]. Whilst these types of natural experiments have sub-
stantial external validity the lack of control means that
there may be other factors driving the sales increases for
example promotional campaigns or price reductions.
In contrast to this, experimental studies in controlled
environments allow for more precise manipulation of
these factors and are easier to replicate compared to
natural experiments. For example, discrete choice exper-
iments in laboratory settings allow researchers to ma-
nipulate multiple attributes of a product and to then
measure how these changes affect the participants’
choices. Product attributes are systematically manipu-
lated and presented to the participants in choice sets. In
conjoint analyses it is assumed that the participants
make trade-offs for the attributes they value and through
this the utility of each attribute can be estimated. How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, these types of studies
of the effect of health-related claims on dietary choices
have not been reviewed systematically.
Previous systematic reviews on dietary choices have
examined the role of nutrition labelling in dietary
choices [3, 4]. These reviews found that nutrition labels
can be used to guide choices although this varies by
population subgroup. However, there have been very few
systematic reviews that specifically examine the effect of
health-related claims. Schemilt, Hendry, & Marteau
(2017) [18] conducted a systematic review of the impact
of nutrition claims on selection, consumption, and per-
ceptions of food products but did not consider health
claims in the review. Williams (2005) [12] conducted a
systematic review on consumer understanding and use
of health claims and found some evidence that claims
may improve the quality of dietary choices. However, ef-
fects were not quantified.
Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of experi-
mental studies to quantify the effect of health-related
claims, on food labels in a retail setting, on adults’ dietary
choices. Our primary outcome was the likelihood of
choosing a product when a health-related claim was
present compared to when such a claim was not present.
Our secondary outcome was the percentage change (from
when a health-related claim was present compared to
when such a claim was not present) in measured, actual
or intended, consumption and/or purchases.
Methods
The protocol for this review was registered with PROS-
PERO in August 2016 (Systematic review registration
number: CRD42016044042) [19].

 Identification of studies
The search strategy was created with input from an infor-
mation specialist (NR) and designed to capture any study of
the effects of food labelling. Terms related to participants
or study designs were not included in the search strategy as
we expected much heterogeneity. The searches were
piloted in November 2015 and the finalised searches con-
ducted in December 2015 and re-run in September 2016
to check for new studies. The search terms are presented
in Appendix A. We searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO,
Embase, CAB abstracts, Business Source Complete, and
Web of Science/Science Citation Index & Social Science
Citation Index. To be eligible for inclusion articles had to
be written in English and published in a peer review jour-
nal. No date restrictions were placed on the search.
Selection of studies
An article was included if it was a controlled experiment
that examined the effect of health-related claims on food
labels on adults’ actual food purchasing and/or consump-
tion behaviour or intended behaviour. Pre- and post-
studies that collected longitudinal individual level data or
population level data on real shopping behaviour were eli-
gible. The health-related claim had to be presented in a re-
tail setting or scenario (e.g. supermarkets) and not a food
service setting or scenario (e.g. menus, canteens etc.). For
the purposes of this review an appropriate control was de-
fined as the same product without a health-related claim
but similar in all other aspects. Non-health related claims
(e.g. taste or organic claims) were not considered to be ap-
propriate control claims due to evidence of a taste/health
association with food choices [15, 16].
The definitions and categorisations of health-related
claims are those proposed by the International Network
for Food and Obesity/non-communicable disease Re-
search, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS)
[20] which are based on the definitions of the Codex Ali-
mentarius Commission (Codex) [21]. Definitions and ex-
amples of sub-types of health-related claims are detailed
in the Additional file 1. Only explicit health-related claims
were considered in this review. Implicit claims, for ex-
ample a picture of a person running or a heart shaped
logo (without underlying nutritional criteria for its use),
were not included. Health-related claims could be pre-
sented as text, a symbol or a combination of both.
Studies that solely examined children’s and/or adoles-
cents’ dietary choices were not included, neither were
studies that were concerned with the purchases of; infant
and baby foods including follow-on milks, foods for spe-
cific nutritional uses, alcoholic beverages, and vitamins
and mineral supplements. Studies that estimated the max-
imum monetary amount participants were willing to pay
for a product with specific attributes were excluded. Stud-
ies that presented the health-related claim as part of a
wider intervention (e.g. healthy eating initiatives, weight
loss groups etc.) were also not included.
Data extraction, synthesis, and analysis
The database search results were imported into Endnote
V7. A single researcher (AK) completed the first screen of
titles to remove any duplicate references and studies that
were clearly unrelated to the systematic review. Full text
articles were obtained when the title and abstract sug-
gested that the study met the inclusion criteria. The full
text was also sought when there was ambiguity about a
paper’s relevance to the review. Another researcher (PS)
assessed 10% of the references (minus records excluded at
the title screen stage) in order to check for any disagree-
ments in classification. Data was extracted into an Excel
spreadsheet. A list of the column headings used can be
seen in the Additional file 1. Where further information
about a study was required the corresponding and/or the
first author were contacted.
The Cochrane Risk of bias tool [22] was adapted and used
to assess the study quality (Table 1). Studies were assessed
for the following potential sources of bias; selection, per-
formance, detection, recruitment, and funding.

 A two-step data analysis strategy was employed. First a
sign test that indicated how the study addressed the pri-
mary research question ‘do health-related claims increase,
actual or intended, consumption and/or purchasing?’ The
second step was to quantify the effect by calculating an
odds ratio for choice-based studies and/or percentage
change for consumption and/or intent-rating scale (e.g.
Likert scale ratings measuring purchase or consumption
intent). Where possible, 95% confidence intervals were
calculated (95% CI). Where studies reported a log-
likelihood for choosing a product (sometimes referred to
as ‘parameter estimates’) the results were exponentiated to
calculate the Odds Ratio. Where results were presented,
for the same population, for sub-types of health or nutri-
tion claims we calculated a weighted average of the results.
Parameter estimates for the entire population (i.e. not ag-
gregated by participant characteristics) were used; where
results were stratified a weighted average was calculated.
A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted due to
the high level of heterogeneity between the studies. Data
were analysed by claim type (health or nutrition claims)
and by food category (based on UK Eatwell Guide categor-
ies [23]). Planned analyses by participant characteristics
(e.g.
gender
and/or
socioeconomic
status)
were
not
conducted as this data was not available for the studies in-
cluded for meta-analyses. An influence analysis was con-
ducted to assess if the omission of one study would greatly
alter the results of the meta-analyses. Funnel plots were
conducted to assess for publication bias. The results pre-
sented in the papers were standardised in Excel and the
meta-analyses conducted in Stata v11 SE [24].

Description of studies
Results of the search
In total 5386 unique studies were identified through the
database searches, of which 31 [14, 25–54] were deemed
eligible for inclusion. The PRISMA flow diagram is pro-
vided in Fig. 1. The observed agreement between the
two researchers on the 10% sample was 87.6% (170/194
decisions), kappa = 0.47 (95% CI 0.30–0.65). A kappa of
0.47 would be categorised as ‘moderate agreement’ [55].
Of the 24 studies where there was a disagreement, a sin-
gle paper was in the final set of included studies (but
not included for the meta-analyses).

 Overall, 262 papers proceeded to the full paper review
and their eligibility was assessed using the inclusion cri-
teria outlined above. Following this, 231 papers were ex-
cluded. The most common reason for exclusion was
that the study was not concerned with a health or
nutrition claim as defined above (n = 61). A summary
of the 31 [14, 25–54] included studies is provided
in Table 2.
Types of studies
European studies were the most common studies with
four studies from Spain [30, 36–38], three from Germany
[28, 29, 40], two from the Netherlands [31, 53], and single
studies from Denmark [51], Greece [42], Italy [33], and
the UK [34]. There were two studies that used multiple
countries; Contini et al. (2015) [35] compared consumer
behaviour of participants in Denmark and Italy, and Van
Wezemael et al. (2014) [54] investigated consumer prefer-
ences in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and the UK.
There were eight studies [14, 32, 39, 41, 45, 48–50, 52] con-
ducted in North America, one of which was conducted in
Canada [32]. Three studies were conducted in Urguay,
South America [25–27], one study was conducted in Taiwan
[43], Australia [44], and two in New Zealand [46, 47].
The most common study type was choice experiments
(n = 15 [27–30, 33, 35–38, 42, 44, 45, 47–49, 54]), of
these ten studies included conjoint analyses that were
relevant to the review [27, 30, 33, 35, 36, 44, 45, 47–49].
There were nine experiments that involved participants
rating, on a Likert scale, their intention to purchase or
consume products [25, 26, 34, 41, 43, 46, 50–52], and
six experiments that involved measuring how much
participants consumed under different claim conditions
[14, 31, 32, 40, 52, 53]. A single study used sales data to
measure the effect of health-related claims [39].
Types of products and claims
There were eight studies that examined nutrition claims
[14, 32, 36–39, 42, 47], 12 studies that examined health
claims [27, 35, 40, 41, 43–45, 48–50, 52, 53], and 11
studies examined both health and nutrition claims
[25, 26, 28–31, 33, 34, 46, 51, 54]. There was one
study that measured the effects of health-related claims
on ‘Fruits and Vegetables’ [48] whereas there were nine
studies that examined ‘Foods High in Fat and/or Sugar’
[26, 31, 33, 35, 38–40, 42, 53], five studies examined
‘Beans, Pulses, Fish, Eggs, Meat and other Proteins’
[37, 44, 47, 50, 54], three studies on ‘Potatoes, Bread, Rice,
Pasta and Other Starchy Carbohydrates’ [34, 46, 52], four
studies on ‘Dairy and Alternatives’ [27, 36, 45, 51], and
two studied ready meals [32, 41]. Six studies looked at
multiple categories of foods [14, 25, 28–30, 49].
Outcomes
Likelihood of selecting product with health-related claim
In total, 16 studies [27, 28, 30, 33, 35–38, 42, 44–49, 54]
reported the likelihood of choosing a product when a
health-related claim was present, one study presented
the percentage chosen of products with a health-related
claim [29]. These results have been transformed into
odds ratio where the comparator was always the same
product without any claims (Table 3). Meta-analyses on
the 17 studies (Fig. 2) found that products carrying
health-related claims were more likely to be purchased
or consumed than an identical product without a claim
(OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.60–1.91). The effect was similar for
nutrition claims (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.29–2.35) and
health claims (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.57–1.91).
Analyses by food category (Fig. 3) found large effects
for claims on products categorised as ‘Beans, Pulses,
Fish, Eggs, Meat and other Proteins’ (OR 2.42, 95% CI
1.87–3.12), and ‘Fruits and Vegetables’ (OR 1.92, 95% CI
1.56–2.35), moderate effects for ‘Foods High in Fat and/
or Sugar’ (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09–1.60), ‘Dairy and Alter-
natives’ (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.22–1.27), and ‘Potatoes,
Bread, Rice, Pasta and Other Starchy Carbohydrates’ (OR
1.17, 95% CI 0.44–3.13), and smaller, non-significant
effects for multiple categories (‘Dairy and Alternatives’ &
‘Potatoes, Bread, Rice, Pasta and Other Starchy Carbohy-
drates’
, OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91, 1.24).
Figure 2 notes: Results have been aggregated when the
same claim type (Health/Nutrition) has been used on
the same product, and on the same population.
Studies appear multiple times if results for different
populations have been presented. For example, Van
Wezemael (2014) presented results for health claims
and, with a different population, health and nutrition
claims combined, for 5 countries.
Where studies present results for the same population
but multiple claim sub-types an average has been calcu-
lated. For example, Casini (2014) presented the effect of
two health claims and one nutrition claim on one popula-
tion. An average of the health claim was calculated and a
separate value for the nutrition claim was also included.
Change in preference or consumption of a product
when a health-related claim was present Products car-
rying health-related claims increased actual or intended
purchasing/consumption by 8.9% (95% CI −4.9%, 22.6%,
10 studies) (Table 4). Health claims lead to a 9.8% in-
crease (95% CI −8.4, 30.0), and nutrition claims lead to a
7.8% increase (95% CI −15.2, 30.8). The averages were
then stratified by the outcome measure used. Studies
that reported a rating scale outcome, such as the Cole-
man et al. study [34] which used a 5 point rating scale of
purchase intent where 1 equalled “definitely” would not
buy’ and 5 equalled ‘definitely would buy’

 average, a 12.6% increase (95% CI 6.1%, 19.0%), whereas
studies measuring consumption reported a 5.6% increase
(95% CI −13.6%, 24.8% - five studies). A single study
reporting store-level sales reported a 16.1% increase
(95% CI 12.0, 20.2%).
The percentage change in preference/consumption dif-
fered by food groups; on average, health-related claims on
‘Dairy and Alternatives’ products led to a 5% reduction,
whereas a 10% increase was observed for ‘Potatoes, Bread,
Rice, Pasta or Other Starchy Carbohydrates’
, a 12 point in-
crease was observed for ‘Foods High in Fat and/or Sugar’
,
and a 7% increase for ‘Composite Foods’.
Seven studies reported purchase/consumption intent-
rating scale outcomes where a higher rating indicated
a greater intention to purchase and/or consume the
product [25, 26, 34, 41, 50–52], however all used dif-
ferent scales i.e.; 7-point [25, 26] or 5-point [50] will-
ing to try scales or, 5-point [34], 7-point [41, 51], or
9-point purchase intent scales [52]. Five of these
studies reported increases in intent when a health-
related claim was present [26, 34, 41, 50, 52] ranging
from +1% [34] to +52% [50]. Coleman [34] tested five
types of health claims on white bread and found that
some claim types had a stronger effect than others.
For example a nutrient and other function claim
related to satiety led to a 1% intent increase (non-sig-
nificant) whereas a similar nutrient and other func-
tion claim related to mineral content led to a 22%
intent increase (95% CI 15%, 29%). Ares [25] found a
reduction in intent when health and nutrition claims

 Wansink & Chandon (2006) [14] all measured the
mean amount (in weight) of food consumed, whereas
Carbonneau et al. (2015) [32] measured the mean nutrient
intake over a 10 days period. Despite reporting similar
outcome measures there was still considerable variance in
the in the average food consumption in the five studies.
For example, when nutrition claims were present there
was a 3–4% increase in consumption of ready meals
[32] and a 28–50% increase in chocolate consumption
[14], but a 149% increase in consumption of trail mix
when a health claim was present [40]. Steenhuis et al.
(2010) [53] examined the effect of the Choices health
logo [56] on a chocolate dessert and found a 7% reduc-
tion (not statistically significant) in consumption. Belei
et al. (2012) [31] also studied the effects of health-
related claims on a chocolate product and found that a
38% increase in consumption when a nutrition claim
was present and a 34% reduction when a health claim
was present. Belei et al. then replicated this study and
had similar results for the effect of a nutrition claim
(43% increase) and found a larger reduction when
a health claim related to antioxidants was present
(−47%), and an even larger reduction with a low choles-
terol claim (−50%).
In two studies Aschemann-Witzel et al. [28, 29]
reported the proportion of products with a health-related
claim that were chosen from a selection of products and
found a 2–5% increase in the number of choices of prod-
ucts than if products were chosen at random.
Risk of bias
The risk of bias table is available in the Additional file 1.
We identified 13 studies as being at risk of selection
bias due to the use of research panels for recruitment
[34, 36, 41, 42, 44–51, 54], and for four studies the
method of recruitment was not clear [28, 31, 35, 38].
For studies involving participants, most used random
allocation and/or random sequence generation. The
majority of the studies were at risk of performance
bias as just three studies [14, 32, 51] used cover
stories to reduce demand characteristics. For example,
Wansink & Chandon (2006) [14] compared the amount of
granola consumed when it was labelled as ‘low fat’ to
when it was labelled as ‘regular’ but informed participants
that the purpose of the study was to rate a video to reduce
the likelihood that participants would alter their behaviour
in accordance to the study aims.
The target population was often not stated in the paper;
however 10 studies [27, 29, 30, 35, 37, 38, 48–50, 54]
found that their participants’ characteristics fit well with
national census data. No studies explicitly listed any con-
flicts of interest due to industry funding.
Tests revealed a high level of heterogeneity in the results
(I-squared: overall 96%, health claims 97%, nutrition
claims - 93%). A funnel plot showed strong asymmetry
suggesting that there was publication bias (Fig. 4).
An influence analysis was conducted to assess if the
omission of one study would greatly alter the results of
the meta-analyses. Overall, four studies had a large effect
on the results, the omission of which affected the esti-
mated effect size by more than 5%. When the Van
Wezemael et al. study [54] was omitted it led to an 18%

 reduction to the overall estimated effect size (OR 1.43,
132–1.55), the omission had a greater impact on the ef-
fect size for nutrition claims (30% reduction, OR 1.22,
0.93–1.60) than for health claims (18% reduction, OR
1.49, 1.36–1.62). Three other studies also led to greater
than 5% change in the estimated effect size for nutrition
claims - omitting Casini et al. (2014) [33] led to a 10% in-
crease (OR 1.91, 1.47, 2.48), whereas omitting Krystallis &
Chrysochou (2012) [42] and Mclean, Hoek, & Hedderley
(2012) [47] led to smaller increases (OR 1.85, 1.33–2.59,
and OR 1.84, 1.34–2.54, respectively).
Discussion
Summary of main results
Results of choice experiments (without actual purchas-
ing of foods) suggest that products carrying a health-
related claim are 75% more likely to be chosen than an
identical product without a health-related claim (OR
1.75, 95% CI 1.60–1.91). This effect is similar for nutri-
tion claims (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.29–2.35) and health
claims (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.57–1.91). The effect varies by
the category of the food that the claim was presented
on: larger effects were seen for health-related claims on
products categorised as ‘Beans, Pulses, Fish, Eggs, Meat
and other Proteins’ (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.87–3.12) or
‘Fruits and Vegetables’ (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.56–2.35),
than for ‘Foods High in Fat and/or Sugar’ (OR 1.35, 95%
CI 1.09–1.60) or other food categories.
The results should be viewed with caution due to the risk
of bias associated with the studies, the high degree of het-
erogeneity in study findings and the potential risk of publi-
cation bias revealed by the funnel plot. Overall, the results
that have been derived from studies using continuous out-
comes (ratings, sales, amount consumed etc.) demonstrate
much more conservative results than those that have been
estimated by conjoint analyses. Averages of such studies es-
timated that health-related claims led to just an 8.9% (95%
CI −4.9%, 22.6%) increase in purchases/consumptions.
Kiesel & Villas-Boas (2013) [39] examined the effect of
nutrition claims (on shelf labels) on real-life purchases of
popcorn products by examining, across five stores, the dif-
ference in sales in between when a shelf-label intervention
was present and was it was not. They found that low calorie
claims increased sales but low fat labels decreased sales.
When these results were standardised for this systematic
review we estimated the overall effect of nutrition claims to
increase sales by 16.1% (95% CI 12.0, 20.2), much lower
than 75% increase estimated from the meta-analyses.
The results from the meta-analyses suggest that health
and nutrition claims have a similar effect on dietary
choices. This would be supported by previous research
on health-related claims which suggests that consumers
often do not clearly distinguish between health and nu-
trition claims [12].
The studies included in this systematic review cover
a range of foods and all of the food groups (as cate-
gorised by the UK Eatwell Guide) were represented,
however there was only one study [48] that examined
the effect of health-related claims on fruits and vege-
tables. Mohelbalian, Cernusca, & Aguilar (2012) con-
ducted a choice experiment examining health claims
on a fruit juice product and found that the odds of
choosing the product with a health claim varied by
how health conscious the consumer was and whether
they already consumed the product. Less health-conscious
consumers who already consumed the fruit juice were
more likely to choose the product with the health claim
(OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.19,2.23) but health-conscious con-
sumers who did not already consume the product had a
much higher odds of choosing the product when a
health claim was present (OR 2.51, 95% CI 2.23, 2.82).
This suggests that consumer attributes, such as lifestyle
traits, may be an important mediator of the effect of
health-related claims.
Although each data line in the meta-analysis is drawn
from either a separate experiment or a separate popula-
tion (or both) many were conducted with similar
methods and hence potentially similar biases (e.g. Van
Wezemael, 2014 [54]). In the random effects models that
we used in this paper we did not adjust for potential
correlation between estimates produced with similar
methods. In a multilevel meta-analysis (35 results nested
in 17 studies) of the combined effect of health and nutri-
tion claims the effect size reduced from 1.75 to 1.41
(95% CI 1.20, 1.67). Such a method accounts for study-
level correlation [57], however in this case may over-
adjust since the data lines are all drawn from either
separate experiments or separate populations or both.
Whilst choice experiments are able to isolate the effect
of the claim from other competing influences (e.g. price,
brand, store factors etc.), they are conducted in an artifi-
cial context and therefore may have limited external valid-
ity. Similarly, in these choice experiments participants are
asked to choose between the product with a claim and the
control product (without a claim). It is unclear whether
these choices would equally translate into real-world pur-
chases made with the participants’ own money, particu-
larly when other factors such as positioning, package
design, and brand factors are likely to play a role.
Limitations of the review
This systematic review is the first, that we are aware of,
that has attempted to quantify the effect of health-related
claims on dietary choices using odds ratios and/or esti-
mating the percentage change in consumption, willingness
to purchase/consume, or actual sales. We have used an
established taxonomy for the classification of claims which
is compatible with EU and international regulations.

 As there has been a large amount of research pub-
lished on various aspects of health-related claims (e.g.
claim understanding, substantiation, recognition etc.),
during the abstract screening stage studies were only in-
cluded if the abstract mentioned one of the following
outcomes; choices, purchases, or consumption. It is pos-
sible that studies that did not mention an outcome rele-
vant to the systematic review went on to present
relevant results in the full paper – such studies would
not have been included.
Furthermore, a single researcher conducted the screen-
ing and data extraction. However, we attempted to limit
the potential bias of this through conducting a 10% title
check and then at the abstract screening stage all three re-
viewers discussed the excluded and ‘undecided’ papers.
Conclusions
Findings from discrete choice experiments suggest that
health-related claims have a substantial effect on dietary
choices; however this effect varies according to the type
of product. Further research is needed to see whether re-
sults may be replicated with similar claims and products.
Furthermore, studies conducted in more natural settings
suggest that health-related claims play a much smaller
role in real-life dietary choices. Therefore, we highlight
the need for more research into the effect of health-
related claims on real-life dietary choices.
After taking these considerations and the findings of this
review into account, it appears that health-related claims
are likely to have a large effect on purchasing and con-
sumption and, thus in turn, on public health. Given the
prevalence of health-related claims and the concerns over
‘health halos’ it is important that health-related claims are
regulated properly to ensure their validity so that only
foods with a better nutritional composition may carry
claims. Modelling exercises assessing the impact of using
a nutrient profile are required.
Further work is also required to establish whether
health-related claims lead to changes in dietary choices
between products within a category (e.g. switching a cola
drink for a fruit juice), or whether they increase total
purchasing/consumption within a food category.
