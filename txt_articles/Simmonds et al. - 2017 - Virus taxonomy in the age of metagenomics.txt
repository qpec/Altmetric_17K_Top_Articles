 Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that proba-
bly infect all cellular forms of life. Although virologists 
have traditionally focused on viruses that cause disease 
in humans, domestic animals and crops, the recent 
advances in metagenomic sequencing, in particular 
high-throughput sequencing of environmental samples, 
have revealed a staggeringly large virome everywhere in 
the biosphere. At least 1031 virus particles exist globally at 
any given time in most environments, including marine 
and freshwater habitats and metazoan gastrointestinal 
tracts, in which the number of detectable virus particles 
exceeds the number of cells by 10–100-fold1–5. To help 
conceptualize the sheer number of viruses in existence, 
their current biomass has been estimated to equal that 
of 75 million blue whales (approximately 200 million 
tonnes) and, if placed end to end, the collective length 
of their virions would span 65 galaxies6. In addition to 
their remarkable abundance, viruses are spectacularly 
diverse in the nature and organization of their genetic 
material, gene sequences and encoded proteins, repli-
cation mechanisms, and interactions with their cellular 
hosts, whether they are antagonistic, commensal or 
mutualistic7. Aquatic environments contain particularly 
diverse forms of viruses, including single-stranded (ss) 
and double-stranded (ds) DNA and RNA viruses with 
genomes that range in size from less than 2,000 bases to 
more than 2 million bases4. Although dsDNA viruses 
that infect bacteria (bacteriophages) are the best studied 
to date, recent work suggests that around 50% of marine 
viruses have ssDNA or RNA genomes8.
Metagenomic data are changing our views on virus 
diversity and are therefore challenging the way in 
which we recognize and classify viruses9. Historically, 
the description and classification of a new virus 
 
by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
(ICTV) have required substantial information on host 
range, replication cycle, and the structure and proper-
ties of virus particles, which were then used to define 
groups of viruses. However, high-throughput sequenc-
ing and metagenomic approaches have radically changed 
 
virology, with many more viruses now known solely from 
 
sequence data than have been characterized experi-
mentally. For example, the family Genomoviridae cur-
rently comprises a single classified virus, whereas more 
than 120 possible members have been sequenced from 
diverse environments. However, these sequenced viruses 
lack information about their hosts and other biolog-
ical properties that would guide their assignment into

Abstract | The number and diversity of viral sequences that are identified in metagenomic data 
far exceeds that of experimentally characterized virus isolates. In a recent workshop, a panel of 
experts discussed the proposal that, with appropriate quality control, viruses that are known only 
from metagenomic data can, and should be, incorporated into the official classification scheme 
of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Although a taxonomy that is 
based on metagenomic sequence data alone represents a substantial departure from the 
traditional reliance on phenotypic properties, the development of a robust framework for 
sequence-based virus taxonomy is indispensable for the comprehensive characterization of the 
global virome. In this Consensus Statement article, we consider the rationale for why 
metagenomic sequence data should, and how it can, be incorporated into the ICTV taxonomy, 
and present proposals that have been endorsed by the Executive Committee of the ICTV.

 species and genera in the family10. Indeed, vast num-
bers of complete, or nearly complete, genome sequences 
have been assembled and characterized from metagen-
omic data for viruses with small11–14, medium15–18 and 
even large19,20 genomes. The identification of entirely 
new groups of viruses from such analyses emphasizes 
the power of metagenomic approaches in discovering 
viruses, some of which could have key functions in the 
regulation of ecosystems, whereas others could coexist 
with their hosts without causing recognizable disease 
or may even be mutualists7. However, realistically, few 
 
of these viruses are ever likely to receive the same level of 
 
experimental characterization as pathogens that cause 
human disease or influence the global economy.
The question of whether viruses that are identified by 
metagenomics can, and should, be incorporated into the 
official ICTV taxonomy scheme on the basis of sequence 
data alone is pressing. In response to this question, a 
workshop of invited experts in the field of virus discov-
ery and environmental surveillance, and members of the 
ICTV Executive Committee, took place in June 2016 to 
discuss this possibility and to develop a framework for 
appropriate approaches to virus classification. We pres-
ent these proposals in this Consensus Statement article, 
together with an explanation of the rationale for their 
development. Our proposals have been subsequently 
endorsed by the ICTV Executive Committee.
Virus diversity
The discrepancy between the number of potential 
taxa into which viruses in environmental samples 
could be classified and the number currently rec-
ognized by the ICTV is striking. A recent analysis 
of dsDNA virus sequences that were characterized 
as part of the Tara Oceans expedition from 43 sur-
face ocean sites worldwide identified 5,476 distinct 
dsDNA virus populations21, but only 39 of these cor-
responded to virus groups that have been classified 
by the ICTV. Most of these populations were both 
abundant and widely dispersed geographically, but 
almost all fell outside of established viral taxa (FIG. 1). 
Early virome studies from different marine habi-
tats hinted at this huge diversity22,23, and, although 
sequencing technologies at the time precluded direct 
genome-wide characterization, mathematical model-
ling predicted several hundred thousand distinct DNA 
viral genotypes. A recent comprehensive metagen-
omic analysis of thousands of diverse samples has 
led to the discovery of approximately 125,000 new 
viral genomes and a 16-fold increase in the number 
of identified viral genes24. Similarly, as technology 
advances, it is becoming clear that ssDNA and RNA 
viruses in marine and other ecosystems are far more 
diverse than currently characterized viruses; however, 
these new viruses remain understudied despite their 
ecological importance11,25–31. Many ssDNA viruses 
identified in metagenomic data encode an evolution-
arily conserved replication-associated protein (Rep), 
whereas the number, orientation and evolutionary 
 
origin of other genes are highly variable in these circular 
Rep-encoding ssDNA viruses (CRESS-DNA viruses)32. 
Phylogenetic analyses have revealed distinct clustering 
of some of these viruses into four recognized families, 
in addition to a vast range of viruses that fall outside 
of these clusters (FIG. 2). Aside from marine environ-
ments, most viruses discovered in wild plants through 
metagenomics seem to be persistent, and only a tiny 
proportion of these viruses are species that are recog-
nized by the ICTV33. Highly diverse novel viruses have

 been similarly reported from insects34,35, and several 
eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses have been identified 
in terrestrial environmental samples24,36.
Metagenomic studies have also uncovered astonish-
ingly abundant novel viruses in the human gastrointes-
tinal tract that, despite decades of research, had not been 
detected previously. For example, the ~97 kb genome of 
a dsDNA bacteriophage, named crAssphage, is six-times 
more abundant in publicly available metagenomic data-
sets from sewage or wastewater samples than all other 
known bacteriophages combined. This virus contributes 
up to 90% of all sequence reads in virus-like particle- 
derived metagenomes and accounts for ~1.7% of all 
human faecal metagenomic sequence reads in public 
databases17.
Furthermore, numerous viruses are hidden in pub-
licly available microbial genomic datasets. A recently 
developed tool, VirSorter37,38, identified 12,498 new viral 
genome sequences in ~15,000 bacterial and archaeal 
genomes37, which increased the number of known 
prokaryotic viruses ~10-fold and identified viruses 
that infect 13 prokaryotic phyla37,38. These advances 
are a striking testimony to the fundamental change in 
virus discovery: the overwhelming majority of new 
viral genomes now come from metagenomic data and 
have never been directly linked to biological agents. 
Virologists, especially viral taxonomists, have no choice 
but to work within this new reality.
Current taxonomy of viruses
The framework that is provided by taxonomy enhances 
our understanding of viruses. It helps communication 
among virologists, and between virologists and other 
stakeholders, such as farmers, growers, regulators and 
potential funders. However, the taxonomy of viruses 
differs in some fundamental aspects from that of cellu-
lar life forms. In particular, viruses lack universal genes 
that can be used to construct a unified phylogeny into 
which all viruses can be placed39–42. Therefore, there is 
no viral equivalent to the cellular tree of life that has 
been established through comparisons of ribosomal 
RNA and (nearly) universal protein-coding genes in 
bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes (notwithstanding 
the complications that are caused by horizontal gene 
transfer)43–45.
The ICTV is solely responsible for the classification 
of viruses into taxa and naming them. Currently, clas-
sified viruses are assigned to the hierarchical ranks of 
family, genus and species, and each taxon has a defined, 
unique and regulated name. Some families are also 
divided into subfamilies that each contain separate 
genera, and a minority of families are also assigned to 
the higher taxon of order. The ICTV disseminates infor-
mation on virus taxonomy through the master species 
list (MSL), which currently lists 7 orders, 112 families, 
610 genera and 3,704 species46 (see Virus Taxonomy: 
2015 Release), and through periodic publication of 
ICTV reports that contain additional descriptive mate-
rial47. The MSL is updated annually based on the sub-
mission of taxonomic proposals to the ICTV Executive 
Committee (see current ICTV Executive Committee 
webpage), mostly by specialized study groups (see 
ICTV Study Groups). These proposals are made avail-
able to the public and are then scrutinized by the ICTV 
Executive Committee for compliance with a minimal 
set of rules that are laid out in the International Code 
of Virus Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN; 
see International Code of Virus Classification and 
Nomenclature webpage), and for the robustness of the 
supporting evidence. The new taxonomy is then ratified 
by voting members of the ICTV and incorporated into 
the MSL annually.
The lowest taxonomic rank is that of species, which 
is defined in the ICVCN as “a monophyletic group of 
viruses whose properties can be distinguished from 
those of other species by multiple criteria”
. Historically, 
the term “multiple criteria” has been interpreted as 
referring to attributes such as replication properties in 
cell culture, virion morphology, serology, nucleic acid 
sequence, host range, pathogenicity, and epidemiology 
or epizootiology. However, there is considerable varia-
tion in the way in which these criteria have been applied 
to viruses in different families by the respective Study 
Groups and approved by the ICTV.

 The ICVCN provides greater freedom for specifying 
the higher taxonomic ranks, with a genus defined as 
 
“a group of species sharing certain common characters”
, 
a family defined as “a group of genera (whether or not 
these are organized into subfamilies) sharing certain 
common characters” and an order defined as “a group 
of families sharing certain common characters”
. These 
looser criteria accommodate the substantial variation 
in the way in which they are applied among the higher 
ranks. As an approximate guide for vertebrate and plant 
viruses, members of different genera in a family typi-
cally have similar genome organizations with homol-
ogous structural and replication-associated genes, but 
often have non-homologous accessory genes, such as 
those that are involved in the evasion of host defence 
and in viral movement in plants. By contrast, between 
families, viruses often have completely different genome 
organizations and may lack any detectable genetic 
relatedness. The presence of homologous, even if not 
closely similar, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases 
(RdRps), proteases and helicases in RNA viruses, and 
Rep-encoding genes in small ssDNA viruses, may, how-
ever, enable distant evolutionary relationships between 
virus families to be identified; such relationships may 
form a basis for the creation of orders. The process of 
identifying such distant relationships and assessing 
their appropriateness for higher rank taxonomic clas-
sification is not trivial, and, consequently, the creation 
of orders requires particularly careful consideration. 
For example, the existence of a substantial set of shared 
genes in diverse large or giant dsDNA viruses of eukar-
yotes has prompted a proposal for the creation of the 
order ‘Megavirales’ (REF. 48), which has thus far not been 
accepted by the ICTV owing to the lack of consensus 
in the field. Similarly, the creation of an order for the 
CRESS-DNA viruses is currently being considered by 
the relevant ICTV Study Groups.
Virus taxonomy in the age of metagenomics
In the past, the approval of a new species by the ICTV 
was typically dependent on the availability of data that 
demonstrate the distinct biological characteristics of the 
respective virus. This requirement has limited the num-
ber of viruses that have been classified and incorporated 
into the MSL. As most viruses are now discovered by 
metagenomics and lack direct correlation with biologi-
cal agents, a workshop was convened to develop a new 
framework for virus taxonomy in the era of metagenom-
ics (BOX 1; Supplementary information S1 (box)). The 
discussions at the workshop reflected the fact that the 
challenges that are posed by metagenomic data are not 
unique to viruses (BOX 2).
Sequence assemblies that are derived from environ-
mental samples often contain complete, verified genome 
sequences of new viruses, but do not directly provide 
information on biological properties. This perceived 
limitation has raised the concern that virus classifica-
tion based on sequence information alone would result 
in a taxonomy of sequences rather than of viruses49. 
However, with appropriate precautions (see below), we 
believe that the detection of a viral sequence in a sam-
ple is sufficient evidence to infer the existence of the 
corresponding virus. Indeed, the concept that a virus 
can be detected, characterized and classified entirely 
through analysis of its sequence has gained traction in 
the burgeoning field of virus discovery. Given that the 
properties of a virus are largely, or entirely, encoded 
 
by its genome, it follows that virus classification based 
 
on sequence information alone is not limited primarily 
by the absence of biological attributes, but by our ina-
bility to accurately read such information and robustly 
infer enzymatic functions, virion structure and other 
phenotypic attributes.
Sequence data provide a wealth of information that 
can be used for the purposes of taxonomy, such as evo-
lutionary relationships, overall genome organization 
(gene content and order, prediction of encoded proteins 
and the presence of characteristic repeated sequences),

 features of genome expression, genome replication 
strategy, the presence or absence of various distinctive 
motifs (for example, polyprotein cleavage sites, internal 
ribosome entry sites, terminal sequences, structural 
folds and host range determinants50), and features of 
global and local genome composition (for example, GC 
content, dinucleotide frequencies51 and codon usage). 
Sequence analyses could thus provide the ‘multiple 
criteria’ that are required for classification into species. 
Indeed, the successful use of sequence information 
in virus classification has been foreshadowed in the 
pre-metagenomic era. For example, the bioinformatic 
characterization of cloned sequences was responsible for 
the discovery of hepatitis C virus, the prediction of its 
properties and replication strategy, the characterization 
of its similarity to members of the family Flaviviridae, 
and the development of effective diagnostic and screen-
ing assays52,53; such advances preceded the visualization 
of virus particles, the detection of viral proteins in vivo 
and the achievement of viral growth in cell culture by 
many years.
However, it is important to recognize that there are 
several technical problems with using viral genomes that 
are assembled from metagenomic datasets for taxonomy. 
Such sequences are often derived from mixed virus pop-
ulations and, consequently, there is a risk of assembling 
artificially chimeric genomes. Furthermore, current 
methodologies are unsuitable for assembling complete 
genome sequences from viruses that have segmented or 
multipartite genomes. Another practical problem arises 
from virus-derived sequences that are integrated into 
host genomes (for example, endogenous virus-like ele-
ments and prophages), many of which are transcribed 
and hence are present in the RNA pool. To use metagen-
omic sequences for classification, these problems need to 
Box 1 | A workshop to advance virus classification
The Wellcome Trust funded a workshop to discuss frameworks for the advancement of 
virus taxonomy in the age of metagenomics. The workshop was convened in Boston, 
Massachusetts, USA, from 9–11 June 2016, and was organized and chaired by P
.S., and 
administered locally by M.L.N. Participants had wide-ranging expertise in viral 
genomics, metagenomic environmental studies and virus classification (13 of the 26 
participants were members of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
(ICTV) Executive Committee), and, based on data presentations and wide-ranging 
discussions, participants set out to develop a series of expert proposals for future 
consideration by the ICTV Executive Committee.
The understanding in the workshop was that the term metagenomic applies to any 
viral sequence that lacks biological or other experimental characterization, although 
the definition of ‘lack’ in practice has varied in the literature. Sequence data are already 
of paramount importance in virus taxonomy, because they currently provide the only 
reliable means of representing evolutionary relationships at the required granularity; 
however, the workshop recognized that the data generated by high-throughput 
sequencing from environmental samples pose major challenges, particularly because 
increasingly powerful methods are producing overwhelming quantities of such data, 
which are linked to little or no biological information.
The workshop participants concluded that it is entirely valid to use metagenomic 
sequences in virus taxonomy in the absence of an isolate or direct biological data, such 
as the visualization of virus particles or the detection of signs or symptoms of disease.  
A set of proposals was developed and is discussed in this Consensus Statement article 
(see also Supplementary information S1 (box)). These proposals were subsequently 
endorsed by the ICTV Executive Committee.
Box 2 | Classifying bacteria, archaea and fungi based on metagenomic data
The procedures that are used to classify viruses and name taxa differ substantially from those that are used for bacteria 
and archaea. The International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria regulates only the names of newly proposed species 
without formally classifying these species into higher ranks. A total of 2,053 named bacteria and archaea were listed in 
the Approved List of Bacterial Names by the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes in 1980. Since then, 
an additional 13,434 species with validly published names have been described in approved journals62. However, this total 
is widely regarded as being at odds with the conservative estimates of several million species of novel bacteria and 
archaea that have been discovered through environmental screening63,64. The assignment of names to bacterial or archaeal 
species requires information on defining biological characteristics, such as morphology, metabolism or ecology, to 
distinguish novel species from previously assigned species. Additional requirements are that the organism must have 
been cultured and an isolate deposited in at least two international repositories. To overcome such limitations, many 
authors have advocated the use of phenotypic characteristics inferred from sequence data as criteria that are required 
for assignment of bacterial species63. Furthermore, a relatively small number (approximately 350) of non-cultured but 
otherwise identifiably distinct bacteria and archaea have been named without the deposition of an isolate, with the 
qualifier ‘Candidatus’ assigned to the species name65. Historically, sequence information has not contributed to the 
taxonomy of bacteria and archaea, although 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences are now available for members of most 
prokaryotic species and have led to the identification of many synonyms (different names for the same bacterial species). 
Despite the major differences in both the routes of evolution and the taxonomic approaches between viruses and 
bacteria and archaea, the current challenge to classification is the same in both cases: an overwhelming number of 
diverse genomes that arguably represent distinct taxa is accumulating from metagenomic research.
Similar comments can be made about other microorganisms. For example, the taxonomy of fungi resembles that of 
bacteria and archaea, with a comparable requirement for the deposition of type samples in one of four international 
repositories under rules that are specified by the International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi and Plants. 
Species assignments remain based largely on biological characteristics. Indeed, the different morphological types of the 
same fungus in its sexual and asexual stages have often been assigned to different species and even genera, although 
there have been serious attempts in recent years to rectify this problem66. There has similarly been no comparable 
attempt, until recently67, to identify and remove synonyms as sequence data have become available. Metagenomics can 
be expected to exert a substantial change on fungal taxonomy, as only a small percentage of fungi are thought to be 
culturable, and the number of distinct fungi in the environment may number in the millions68. The use of genomic 
markers, such as the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, has been proposed as a biological barcode for the genomic 
assignment of fungi67.

 be addressed by robust computational and experimental 
methods. However, these caveats do not represent fun-
damental barriers to virus classification, as the tech-
nology that is used to create metagenomic sequences is 
improving continuously, and many of the problems, par-
ticularly those that are associated with de novo assembly, 
will be resolved. These improvements include methods 
that generate longer sequence reads and those that use 
template circularization to decrease error rates54.
Proposals
The workshop reached a consensus view on classifying 
viruses solely on the basis of metagenomic sequence data 
and, consequently, developed a set of proposals (BOX 1; 
Supplementary information S1 (box)). These proposals 
are diagrammatically summarized in FIG. 3.
Basis of classification. Classifying viruses that are 
identified only from metagenomic data will advance 
virus taxonomy, dependent on appropriate checks on 
data integrity and following the standard procedures 
 
of assignment. This is expected to involve the creation of 
higher rank taxa that consist entirely of viruses that are 
identified from metagenomic sequence data.
Creating new species. The current ICTV species defini-
tion suffices for the classification of viruses based only 
on sequence information. Virus characteristics that 
can be inferred from sequence data, including genome 
organization, replication strategy, presence of homolo-
gous genes, and, potentially, host range or type of vec-
tor, may serve as additional biological characteristics. 
These may be used to delineate species in the absence 
of pheno 
typic data that have often been relied on for 
existing species definitions. Such information is best 
inferred from genomic sequences that comprise the 
complete coding potential of the respective virus and 
should be a minimum requirement for classification 
based on sequences alone.
Assigning new species and genera to existing families. 
Demarcation procedures vary widely between virus 
groups and are typically based on parameters that 
include sequence-based phylogeny and various biologi-
cal attributes. Although recognizing that direct biological 
 
information may form a part of the definition of exist-
ing taxa, viruses that are identified from metagenomic 
data can be classified into additional taxa (species and 
genera) if their sequence relationships are comparable to 
those among existing taxa in that family.
Delineating new families and orders. Viruses that have 
genome sequences that lack close relationships to viruses 
in existing taxa pose a particular problem, as there is no 
phenotypically derived standard by which they can be 
classified. In this situation, assignment of a virus to a 
new family could be based on limited or absent genetic 
homology to viruses in recognized families and the 
existence of major differences in genome organization 
or inferred replication strategy. Clustering and patterns 
of variation among more closely related metagenomic 
sequences might be used to assign viruses hierarchically 
to lower taxonomic ranks in such groups. However, the 
creation of a new family, and the assignment of genera 
Phenotypic data
Proposed taxonomy
• Can be used for virus genome and 
 metagenomic sequence data
• Based on
 – Phenotypes inferred from genome analysis
 – Sequence relatedness inferred from 
    phylogeny, homology detection and 
    divergence metrics
• Biological data not essential
Genomic data
Metagenomic data
Biological properties
Phylogeny, sequence distances
Inference of biological properties
Taxonomy now
• Informed by biological properties
 – Pathogenicity
 – Host range
 – Epidemiology
• Informed by sequence relationships
 – Divergence
 – Phylogeny
Taxonomy then
• Used from 1970s–1990s
• Based on biology
 – In vitro properties
 – Virion structure
 – Antigenic relationships
• Wider host factors
 – Pathogenicity
 – Host range
 – Epidemiology
Figure 3 | Summary of the proposed classification pipeline. The proposed classification pipeline (red arrows) enables both 
metagenomic sequence data and conventionally derived virus sequences to be classified. Inferred biological properties that 
are obtained by bioinformatic analysis of virus sequences together with information on sequence relatedness and gene 
content, and, optionally, any observed biological properties (dotted line), may all be used as defining criteria for species and 
higher rank taxonomic assignment in the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) taxonomy. This procedure 
differs from current (green arrows) and previous practice (blue arrows), in which biological data and/or host information and 
sequence data (current), or biological data alone (1970s–1990s), were required for classification.

 and species within it, would require a considerable 
amount of sequence information and the development 
of a sound classification framework that is capable of 
accommodating it. Formalized clustering and network 
analysis methods that create similarity metrics that are 
based on the detection of homologous genes and their 
genetic divergence55–57 could be valuable for taxonomic 
assignments and should be critically evaluated for their 
effectiveness in the development of a robust classifica-
tion approach. Frameworks of this kind may have to be 
tailored to the virus group. For example, bacteriophage 
taxonomy is typically based on virion sequence and 
structure58, but these characteristics may not be appro-
priate for the classification of animal and plant RNA 
viruses, in which deeper relationships are most often 
apparent in the gene sequences of the RNA polymerase 
and other conserved replication-associated proteins59.
Nomenclature of taxa identified only from sequence 
data. The system that is currently used by the ICTV 
for taxon nomenclature is readily extendable to addi-
tional species, genera and families that are created from 
metagenomic sequence data. Furthermore, taxa may 
contain viruses that were identified by various methods. 
Hence, a species that initially comprises viruses that are 
characterized solely from sequence data could eventu-
ally include viruses that are identified by isolation and 
that have directly defined biological properties. Thus, 
metagenomic status belongs to, and would be recovera-
ble from, the sequence record for a particular virus and 
not to the entire taxon to which it is assigned. Although 
some virologists have adopted the term ‘associated’ 
as part of the nomenclature of viruses that were iden-
tified in metagenomics datasets (for example, human 
stool-associated circular virus (GQ404856 (REF. 60)); for 
other examples see REFS 12,13,26,61), it is unnecessary to 
incorporate this or other such terms that are equivalent 
to the bacterial term ‘Candidatus’ into virus taxon names.
Improvement of the procedure for the classification of 
viruses. The current process of submitting taxonomic 
proposals to the ICTV suffices, in principle, for dealing 
with viruses that are known only from sequence data. 
However, the process could be substantially improved 
and streamlined through the development of electronic 
submission methods that incorporate appropriate 
quality checks for accuracy and completeness of data. 
In particular, the format could be modified to enable 
numerous species (possibly many hundreds or thou-
sands) to be proposed in the same submission without 
the unnecessary repetition of information. In addition, 
procedures could be developed that shorten the time 
that is required for processing proposals and updating 
the MSL.
ICTV endorsement. As an important initial step towards 
metagenomics-based virus taxonomy, the proposals that 
were developed during the workshop were presented 
to, and discussed at, the ICTV Executive Committee 
meeting from 22–24 August 2016. The proposals were 
supported by all members of the Executive Committee 
that were present (one member was unavoidably absent 
but has since expressed support) and their practical 
implementation was seen as a matter of high priority 
for the ICTV. This process will include actively inviting 
the virology community to submit taxonomic propos-
als that are based on metagenomic sequences, providing 
guidelines on data standards (including sequence quality 
and completeness) and developing more effective data 
submission tools for large sequence datasets. The ICTV 
Executive Committee plans to explain and develop these 
steps in a separate article.
Conclusions
We believe that the time has come to advance the phi-
losophy and practice of virus taxonomy by admitting 
viruses that are identified only from metagenomics data 
as being bona fide viruses, dependent on appropriate 
checks on data integrity and following the standard 
procedures of taxonomic assignment. We expect that 
this process will lead to the imminent creation of higher 
rank taxa that consist entirely of viruses identified by 
metagenomics.
We believe that the implementation of the propos-
als outlined here will enable the creation of a vastly 
expanded formal taxonomy for viruses that will be a 
major contribution to future research on virus diversity. 
Only by accepting that sequences that are generated by 
metagenomic methods truly represent existing viruses 
and by including them in classification schemes, can 
we hope to better understand the ecology, history and 
impact of the global virome.
