Context: Limited data are available evaluating the effects of soy isoflavones on metabolic status
of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Objective: The current study was performed to determine the effects of soy isoflavones on met-
abolic status of patients with PCOS.
Methods: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed on 70 women
diagnosed with PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria who were 18–40 years old. Participants
were randomly allocated into two groups to take either 50 mg/d soy isoflavones (n � 35) or placebo
(n � 35) for 12 weeks. Metabolic, endocrine, inflammation, and oxidative stress biomarkers were
quantified at the beginning of the study and after the 12-week intervention.
Results: After 12 weeks of intervention, compared to the placebo group, soy isoflavone adminis-
tration significantly decreased circulating serum levels of insulin (�1.2 � 4.0 vs �2.8 � 4.7 �IU/mL;
P � .001) and homeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (�0.3 � 1.0 vs �0.6 �
1.1; P � .001) and increased the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (�0.0009 � 0.01 vs
�0.01 � 0.03; P � .01). Supplementation with soy isoflavones resulted in significant reductions in
free androgen index (�0.03 � 0.04 vs �0.02 � 0.03; P � .001) and serum triglycerides (�13.3 � 62.2
vs �10.3 � 24.5 mg/dL; P � .04) compared to the placebo group. There was a significant increase
in plasma total glutathione (�96.0 � 102.2 vs �22.7 � 157.8 �mol/L; P � .04) and a significant
decrease in malondialdehyde levels (�0.7 � 0.8 vs �0.8 � 2.3 �mol/L; P � .001) by soy isoflavone
intake compared with the placebo group. We did not observe any significant effect of soy isoflav-
one intake on other lipid profiles and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers.
Conclusion: Soy isoflavone administration for 12 weeks in women with PCOS significantly im-
proved markers of insulin resistance, hormonal status, triglycerides, and biomarkers of oxidative
stress. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101: 3386–3394, 2016)
P
olycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endo-
crine disorder among women of reproductive age,
is mainly associated with hyperinsulinemia, impaired
glucose metabolism, hyperandrogenism, and dyslipide-
mia (1). Moreover, emerging evidence has shown that
elevated levels of inflammatory factors and biomarkers
of oxidative stress in the blood and histological samples
of women with PCOS might play important roles in
the pathogenesis of PCOS (2, 3). These disorders can
increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
coronary heart disease, endometrial cancer (4), and
ovulatory dysfunction (5, 6).

 Recently, some human studies have shown the relation
between dietary pattern and metabolic profiles, inflam-
matory factors, and biomarkers of oxidative stress among
women with PCOS (7–9). There is growing interest in
using the soy isoflavones in diseases related to metabolic
syndrome (10). The basis of this interest derives mostly
from the results of epidemiological surveys, and nutri-
tional intervention studies in human and animal models
suggest that dietary isoflavones have protective effects
against menopausal symptoms, coronary heart disease,
cancer, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and various forms
of chronic renal disease (11–13). In a pilot study without
the placebo group by Romualdi et al (14), it was shown
that taking 36 mg/d of genistein for 6 months among pa-
tients with PCOS decreased low-density lipoprotein
(LDL)-cholesterol levels but did not affect anthropometric
features, other lipid profiles, the hormonal milieu, men-
strual cyclicity, and glycoinsulinemic metabolism. In ad-
dition, consumption of genistein (an isoflavone in soybean
products) with a dose of 18 mg twice a day orally for 3
months among women with PCOS decreased LH, triglyc-
erides, LDL-cholesterol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
(DHEAS), and T but did not change other lipid profiles
and FSH (8). Furthermore, further studies have reported a
positive impact of phytoestrogens on the glycoinsulinemic
assessment of postmenopausal women, obese subjects,
and patients with T2DM (15, 16).
Favorable effects of soy isoflavones on metabolic pro-
files may result from a direct inhibitory activity on several
enzymes, which accounts for the positive metabolic effects
associated with their dietary intake (14), glucose metab-
olism (17), and through the inhibition of insulin discharge
by the pancreatic islets (18). Limited data are available
assessing the effects of soy isoflavones on glucose homeo-
stasis parameters, hormonal status, lipid concentrations,
markers of inflammation and oxidative stress of patients
with PCOS. The aim of the present study was to evaluate
theeffectsofsoyisoflavonesupplementationonmetabolic
status in women with PCOS.
Subjects and Methods
This study was a prospective randomized, double-blind, place-
bo-controlled clinical trial.
Participants
This trial was conducted among 70 participants with PCOS
aged 18–40 years who were referred to the Kosar Clinic in Arak,
Iran,fromDecember2015toFebruary2016.DiagnosisofPCOS
was performed according to the Rotterdam criteria (19). Those
with two of the following criteria were considered as having
PCOS: 1) oligo- and/or anovulation (defined as menses de-
layed � 35 days or � eight spontaneous hemorrhagic episodes
per year); 2) clinical (hirsutism using modified Ferriman-Gallwey
score [mFG] of � 8) (19) and/or biochemical signs of hyperandro-
genism (20); and 3) polycystic ovaries (12 or more follicles in each
ovary measuring 2–9 mm in diameter, and/or increased ovarian
volume�10mL3)(19).Weexcludedpregnantwomenandsubjects
with elevated levels of prolactin, thyroid disorder, endocrine dis-
eases including diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, and gastro-
intestinal problems from the study.
Ethics statements
This study was conducted in accordance with the Decla-
ration of Helsinki, and informed consent was obtained from
all participants. The research was approved by the ethics com-
mittee of Arak University of Medical Sciences and was re-
corded in the Iranian web site for registration of clinical trials
(http://www.irct.ir: IRCT201601025623N62).
Study design
At the beginning of the study, all participants were matched for
age,phenotypesofPCOS,andbodymassindex(BMI).Participants
were then randomly divided into two groups to receive either soy
isoflavone supplements (n � 35) or placebo (n � 35) for 12 weeks.
Participants were requested not to change their ordinary physical
activity and not to take any nutritional supplements during the
12-week trial. All patients completed 3-day food records and three
physical activity records at the study baseline; at weeks 3, 6, and 9
of the intervention; and at the end of the trial. Daily macro- and
micronutrient intakes were analyzed by nutritionist IV software
(First Databank). In the current study, physical activity was de-
scribed as metabolic equivalents (METs) in hours per day. To de-
termine the MET for each patient, we multiplied the time reported
for each physical activity (in hours per day) by its related MET
coefficient by standard tables (21).
Intervention
In the intervention group, participants received 50 mg/d soy
isoflavones containing 37.5 mg genistein, 10 mg daidzein, and
2.5mgglyciteinfor12weeks.Duetotheexistenceoflimiteddata
about the appropriate dosage of soy isoflavones for PCOS, we
used the above-mentioned dosage of soy isoflavones based on a
previous study in PCOS patients (14). It must be considered that
this level (50 mg soy isoflavones) is achievable by consuming 500
mL soy milk daily in a real dietary intake. Soy isoflavone sup-
plement and placebo capsules were similar in shape and size and
were manufactured by Soygol.
Treatment adherence
Every 4 weeks, participants were given enough supplements
to last until 3 days after their next scheduled visit, and they were
instructed to return all the unused supplements at each visit.
Patients were scheduled for follow-up visits every 2 weeks for an
intermediate evaluation. To evaluate compliance, the remaining
supplements were counted and subtracted from the amount of
supplements provided to the participants. To increase compli-
ance, all participants received short messages on their cell phones
every day to remind them about taking the capsules.

 of the study and after the 12-week intervention. BMI was cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared. Waist circumference (WC) was assessed at the mini-
mum circumference between the iliac crest and the last rib. Hip
circumference (HC) was quantified at the maximum protuber-
ance of the buttocks. All anthropometric measures were done by
a trained midwife.
Assessment of outcomes
In our study, markers of insulin resistance and androgens
were considered as the primary outcome, and lipid profiles and
biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress were consid-
ered as the secondary outcomes.
Clinical assessments
In the current study, clinical assessments included determi-
nations of hirsutism using a mFG scoring system (22), of acne
score (23), and of alopecia based on assessment guidelines col-
lated by Olsen et al (24). Acne was marked by a four-point scale:
0, no acne; 1, minor acne on face; 2, moderate acne on face only;
and 3, severe acne on face and back or chest (23).
Biochemical assessment
Ten-milliliter fasting blood samples were collected at the be-
ginning and end of the study at the Arak reference laboratory in
a fasting status and centrifuged to separate serum. Then, the
samples were stored at �80°C before analysis. Serum insulin
concentrations were assessed using available ELISA kit (Dia
Metra) with inter- and intra-assay coefficient variances (CVs) of
3.3 to 4.9%, respectively. The homeostasis model of assessment-
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model of assess-
ment �-cell function (HOMA-B), and quantitative insulin
sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were determined according to
the suggested formulas (25). Serum total T with inter- and intra-
assay CVs of 4.0 to 5.9%, SHBG with inter- and intra-assay CVs
of 3.5 to 5.1%, free T with inter- and intra-assay CVs of 3.9 to
5.8%, and DHEAS concentrations with inter- and intra-assay
CVs of 4.1 to 6.2% were determined using commercial kits
(DiaMetra). Free androgen index (FAI) was calculated as the
ratio of total T to SHBG. Enzymatic kits (Pars Azmun) were used
to quantify fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum triglycerides,
and very LDL (VLDL)-, total-, LDL-, and high-density lipopro-
tein (HDL)-cholesterol concentrations. All inter- and intra-assay
CVs for FPG and lipid concentrations were � 5%. Serum high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations were
evaluated by commercial ELISA kit (LDN) with inter- and intra-
assay CVs of 4.5 to 6.4%, respectively. The plasma nitric oxide
(NO) concentrations were assessed using Griess method (26).
Plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) concentrations were
determined by the method of ferric-reducing antioxidant power
developed by Benzie and Strain (27), total glutathione (GSH)
concentrations were determined using the method of Beutler and
Gelbart (28), and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were
determined by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances spec-
trophotometric test (29). All inter- and intra-assay CVs for NO,
TAC, GSH, and MDA concentrations were � 5%.
Sample size
Using a formula suggested for clinical trials, having 30 par-
ticipants in each group was adequate while considering a type 1
error (�) of 0.05 and type 2 error (�) of 0.20 (power � 80%), 4.3
pg/mL as SD, and 3.0 pg/mL as the mean distinction (d) of total
T as the key variable (30). Assuming five dropouts in each group,
the final sample size was determined to be 35 participants in each
group.
Randomization
Randomization assignment was conducted using computer-
generatedrandomnumbers.Randomizationandallocationwere
concealed from the researchers and participants until the final
analyses were completed. The randomized allocation sequence,
enrolling participants, and allocating them to interventions were
conducted by a trained midwife at the gynecology clinic.
Statistical methods
To evaluate whether the study variables were normally dis-
tributed or not, we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For non-
normally distributed variables (total T, DHEAS, and GSH), we
applied log transformation. To detect differences in anthropo-
metric measures as well as in macro- and micronutrient intakes
between the two groups, we applied Student’s t test to indepen-
dent samples. The Pearson �2 test was used to compare categor-
ical variables. To determine the effects of soy isoflavone admin-
istration on markers of insulin resistance, hormonal status, lipid
profiles, biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress, we
used one-way repeated measures ANOVA. In this analysis, the
treatment (soy isoflavones vs placebo group) was regarded as a
between-subject factor, and time with two time-points (the onset
of the study and after 12-week intervention) was considered as
a within-subject factor. To identify within-group differences
(baseline and end of trial), we used paired-samples t tests. Ad-
justment for changes in baseline values of biochemical parame-
ters, age, and BMI at the baseline was performed by analysis of
covariance using general linear models. P value � .05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. All statistical analyses used the
Statistical Package for Social Science version 18 (SPSS Inc).
Results
In the current study, all 70 participants (soy isoflavones
[n � 35] and placebo [n � 35]) completed the trial (Figure
1). On average, the rate of compliance in the present study
was high, such that � 90% of capsules were taken
throughout the study in both groups. No side effects were
reported after the consumption of soy isoflavone supple-
ments in women with PCOS throughout the study.
Mean age, height, weight, BMI, WC, HC, and METs at
the baseline and the end of the trial were not statistically

did not have any effect on FPG, other lipid profiles, and
biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress.
Patients with PCOS are susceptible to several aberra-
tions, including metabolic disorders, inflammation, and
oxidative stress (2, 5, 6, 31). Our study indicated that soy
isoflavone intake for 12 weeks in women with PCOS re-
sulted in a significant decrease in serum insulin levels,
HOMA-IR, and HOMA-B and a significant increase in
QUICKI compared with the placebo. Supporting our find-
ings, a 2-month supplementation with a soy food contain-
ing 50 mg isoflavones/d led to a significant decrease of
insulin levels among postmenopausal women (30). Fur-
thermore, preliminary data from epidemiological surveys
and nutritional intervention studies in animals and hu-
mans have reported that phytoestrogens may improve
glycemic and insulinemic concentrations (15, 32). Few
studies have shown an amelioration of insulin sensitiv-
ity in animal and human models after soy isoflavone
administration (17, 33). However, a 6-month adminis-
tration of soy protein with or without isoflavone
supplementation did not influence glycemic control
and insulin sensitivity among Chinese postmenopausal
women (34). The results of the current study may sup-
port a direct pharmacological effect of soy isoflavones
on the markers of insulin metabolism. Furthermore, soy
isoflavones may improve markers of insulin resistance
through the inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases,
which play an important role in the regulation of insulin
secretion by pancreatic �-cells (15).
The current study demonstrated that soy isoflavone in-
take for 12 weeks in women with PCOS led to a significant
decrease in FAI and mFG scores compared with the pla-
cebo, but there was no change in other hormonal profiles.

Soy Isoflavones and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome

 Invitrostudieshaveindicatedthatphytoestrogensareable
to increase SHBG mRNA levels (35). In addition, two in
vivo studies confirmed that dietary intake of soy isofla-
vones in postmenopausal women resulted in a significant
increase of circulating levels of SHBG (36, 37). However,
few studies were able to observe any change in androgen
and SHBG levels in subjects with PCOS during the isofla-
vone treatment (14, 38). Soy isoflavones, mainly by bind-
ing to the estrogen receptor, may modulate the activity of
steroidogenic enzymes such as P450 aromatase, 3�-hy-
droxysteroid dehydrogenase (3�-HSD), and 17�- HSD
(39, 40). Inhibiting expression and activity of 3�-HSD by
phytoestrogens, which catalyzes the conversion of andro-
stenediol to T, may result in decreased levels of T (41). In
addition, phytoestrogens may increase SHBG levels
through increased SHBG mRNA levels (35) and stimulat-
ing SHBG production (37).
Findings of the present study indicated that supplemen-
tation with soy isoflavones in PCOS patients significantly
decreased serum triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol lev-
els compared with the placebo but did not influence other
serumlipidprofiles.Beneficialeffectsofsoyisoflavoneson
blood lipids were the most consistently reported findings.
Two recent meta-analyses have demonstrated that the iso-
flavone content of soy may be responsible for its lipid-
lowering effects (42, 43). In addition, triglyceride levels
were significantly lower after 6 months of high-dose iso-
flavone treatment (300 mg/d) in healthy postmenopausal
women, but the difference did not persist after 1 year (44).
However, a daily supplement of 84 or 126 mg soy germ
isoflavones did not affect lipid profiles in early postmeno-
pausal Chinese women after 24 weeks of treatment (45).
Soy isoflavones may reduce triglycerides and VLDL-cho-
lesterol levels by the reduction of glucose incorporation
into lipids (46), dose-dependent inhibition of glucose con-
version into lipids, and increased lipolysis and decreased
lipid synthesis (47).
We found that, compared with the placebo, soy isofla-
vone intake in women with PCOS did not affect inflam-
matory markers. In agreement with our study, soy milk
consumption for 4 weeks had no significant effect on
inflammatory markers among T2DM patients with ne-
phropathy (48). Similar findings were seen among post-
menopausal Chinese women with early hyperglycemia for
6 months (49) and among postmenopausal Caucasian and
African American women for 3 months (50). In addition,
a high soy diet for 4 weeks had no effect on vascular NO
production in animal models (51). However, C-reactive
protein concentrations were decreased after the intake of
0.5 cup of soy nuts (25 g of soy protein and 101 mg of
aglycone isoflavones) was replaced with daily intake of
25 g of non-soy protein for 8 weeks among postmeno-
pausal women (52). Increased inflammatory cytokines in
women with PCOS render them at a potential increased

 risk for the development of atherosclerosis, T2DM, infer-
tility, and other comorbidities (53). The discrepancies re-
garding this issue between our study and other studies
might be explained by different study designs, different
types and durations of phytoestrogen supplementation,
and general characteristics of the study participants.
The current study demonstrated that taking soy isofla-
vones among women with PCOS was associated with a
significant rise in plasma GSH and a significant reduction
in plasma MDA levels compared with the placebo, but it
did not influence plasma TAC concentrations. In line with
our results, the consumption of isoflavone-enriched pasta
by patients with T2DM for 8 weeks resulted in a signifi-
cant rise in GSH levels (54). Moreover, Azadbakht et al
(55) observed that soya consumption for 8 weeks reduced
plasma MDA concentrations in postmenopausal women
with the metabolic syndrome (55). In another study, soy
protein with or without isoflavones showed no significant
effect on the antioxidant capacity concentrations (56).
However, few researchers observed any beneficial effects
after the intake of soy isoflavones on GSH and MDA lev-
els. For instance, soy milk supplementation for 4 weeks
did not alter plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress in post-
menopausal women (57). In a study by Yang et al (58), it
was also observed that in rats fed peptic-digested soy
protein, no changes in circulating MDA were found. Ox-
idative stress levels are correlated with obesity, insulin
resistance, hyperandrogenemia, and chronic inflamma-
tion (59). In addition, increased oxidative stress is consid-
ered a potential inducement of PCOS pathogenesis (60).
Oxidative stress could also directly induce genetic varia-
tion by DNA damage, such as DNA chain rupture and
base modification, and epigenetic change including ele-
vated DNA methylation levels, which both play important
roles in the pathogenesis of cancer (61, 62). Phytoestrogen
intake may result in decreased oxidative stress through
inhibiting oxidative modification of LDL-cholesterol
(63). In addition, isoflavones may decrease oxidative
stress through their ability to modulate gene expression
and the activity levels of enzymes involved in antioxidant
defense and the metabolism of xenobiotics including nic-
otinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen qui-
none oxidoreductase 1 and glutathione S-transferase (64).
Limitations of the current study include the lack of testing
for a dose-response relationship between soy isoflavone in-
take and occurred changes in the metabolic profiles and bio-
markers of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we did not evalu-
ate soy isoflavone administration on estrogen levels and
other biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. It
must be noted that we quantified total T and other steroids
using the method of the ELISA. Due to limited funding for
research projects in developing countries, we were unable to
make more accurate determination of total T and other ste-
roid levels with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spec-
trometry methods. Furthermore, we did not validate ELISA
kitsagainstthe“goldstandard”liquidchromatography-tan-
dem mass spectrometry. Therefore, our findings should be
interpreted with caution.
In conclusion, soy isoflavone administration for 12
weeks in women with PCOS significantly improved mark-
ers of insulin resistance, hormonal status, triglycerides,
and biomarkers of oxidative stress.
