Effect of diet and physical activity based interventions 
in  
pregnancy on gestational weight gain and pregnancy 
 
outcomes:  
meta-analysis of individual participant data from 
 
randomised trials
The International Weight Management in Pregnancy (i-WIP) Collaborative Group
ABSTRACT
Objective
To synthesise the evidence on the overall and 
differential effects of interventions based on diet 
and physical activity during pregnancy, primarily on 
gestational weight gain and maternal and offspring 
composite outcomes, according to women’s body mass 
index, age, parity, ethnicity, and pre-existing medical 
condition; and secondarily on individual complications.
DESIGN
Systematic review and meta-analysis of individual 
participant data (IPD). 
DATA SOURCES
Major electronic databases from inception to February 
2017 without language restrictions.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES
Randomised trials on diet and physical activity based 
interventions in pregnancy.
DATA SYNTHESIS
Statistical models accounted for clustering of 
participants within trials and heterogeneity across 
trials leading to summary mean differences or odds 
ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the effects 
overall, and in subgroups (interactions).
RESULTS
IPD were obtained from 36 randomised trials (12 526 
women). Less weight gain occurred in the intervention 
group than control group (mean difference −0.70 kg, 
95% confidence interval −0.92 to −0.48 kg, I2=14.1%; 
33 studies, 9320 women). Although summary effect 
estimates favoured the intervention, the reductions 
in maternal (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 
0.79 to 1.03, I2=26.7%; 24 studies, 8852 women) and 
offspring (0.94, 0.83 to 1.08, I2=0%; 18 studies, 7981 
women) composite outcomes were not statistically 
significant. No evidence was found of differential 
intervention effects across subgroups, for either 
gestational weight gain or composite outcomes. 
There was strong evidence that interventions reduced 
the odds of caesarean section (0.91, 0.83 to 0.99, 
I2=0%; 32 studies, 11 410 women), but not for other 
individual complications in IPD meta-analysis. When 
IPD were supplemented with study level data from 
studies that did not provide IPD, the overall effect 
was similar, with stronger evidence of benefit for 
gestational diabetes (0.76, 0.65 to 0.89, I2=36.8%; 
59 studies, 16 885 women).
CONCLUSION
Diet and physical activity based interventions during 
pregnancy reduce gestational weight gain and lower 
the odds of caesarean section. There is no evidence 
that effects differ across subgroups of women.
Introduction
Half of all women of childbearing age worldwide 
are overweight or obese.1-3 Obesity and excessive 
gestational weight gain put mother and offspring 
at risk, both in pregnancy and in later life.4-6 The 
resultant costs to the health service and society are 
considerable.7 8 Increasingly, healthcare organisations 
and research funding bodies prioritise research on 
interventions and strategies to reduce maternal weight 
related adverse outcomes in pregnancy.9-12
Syntheses of study level data on effects of diet and 
physical activity based interventions in pregnancy13 
have shown an overall benefit on limiting gestational 
weight gain, but the findings varied for their protective 
effect on maternal and offspring outcomes.13 14 
Importantly, the subgroups of women who may benefit 
the most from such interventions are not known.15 For 
this, primary studies do not have sufficient power,16 17 
and meta-analyses of study level data are limited by the 
absence of published details of subgroup effects,18 and 
by potential ecological bias.19 These problems can be 
addressed by evidence synthesis using raw individual 
level data from relevant studies.20 21
We undertook an individual participant data (IPD) 
meta-analysis to assess the effects of diet and physical 
activity based interventions, primarily on gestational 
weight gain and on maternal and offspring composite 
outcomes, in subgroups defined by body mass index 
(BMI), age, parity, ethnicity, and pre-existing medical

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Increased weight gain in pregnancy is associated with maternal and fetal 
complications
Interventions based on diet or physical activity or both in pregnancy minimise 
gestational weight gain
Interventions based on diet and physical activity may have a potential role in 
preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Diet and physical activity based interventions consistently reduce gestational 
weight gain across various subgroups of women categorised by age, parity, body 
mass index, ethnicity, and pre-existing medical condition
The reduction in odds of adverse maternal and offspring composite outcomes 
with diet and physical activity is not significant, and does not vary across various 
subgroups of women
Interventions significantly lower the odds of caesarean section and have no 
effect on offspring outcomes

condition. Furthermore, we assessed the overall effects, 
and those of individual interventions (diet, physical 
activity, mixed), on critically important maternal and 
offspring complications. In addition to using IPD, we 
also assessed the impact of incorporating study level 
data from other studies not providing IPD.
Methods
The IPD meta-analysis was performed using a 
prespecified protocol (PROSPERO CRD42013003804)22 
and was reported in line with recommendations of the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
Meta-Analysis of Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-
IPD).23
Literature search and study identification
We searched the major electronic databases Medline, 
Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Health 
Technology Assessment Database from October 2013 
to March 2015 to update our previous search in this 
topic for randomised trials on diet and physical activity 
based interventions in pregnancy.13 The search was 
further updated in January 2016 and February 2017 to 
identify new studies. We searched the internet by using 
general search engines, and contacted researchers in 
the specialty to identify relevant trials. There were no 
language restrictions. Web appendix 1 provides details 
of the search strategy.
Two independent researchers (ER and NM, AAM, or 
EM) selected studies in a two stage process. In the first 
stage, potential citations were identified. Next, we did a 
detailed evaluation of the full manuscripts of potential 
papers and selected articles that fulfilled the eligibility 
criteria. We included randomised trials that assessed the 
effects of interventions based on diet, physical activity, 
and mixed interventions in pregnancy, on maternal and 
offspring outcomes. We classified complex interventions 
on diet and physical activity, including those with 
behavioural change components, as mixed interventions. 
We excluded studies that only included women with 
gestational diabetes at baseline, involved animals, 
reported only non-clinical outcomes, and were published 
before 1990. The primary outcomes were gestational 
weight gain, a composite of maternal outcomes, and 
a composite of offspring outcomes. The secondary 
outcomes were individual maternal and offspring 
complications. The components of the composite 
outcomes were determined by a two round Delphi survey 
of researchers in this specialty, and were considered to be 
critically important to clinical practice.24 The maternal 
composite outcome included gestational diabetes 
mellitus, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm 
delivery, and caesarean section. The offspring composite 
outcome included stillbirth, small for gestational age 
fetus, large for gestational age fetus, and admission of the 
newborn to a neonatal intensive care unit.
We defined gestational weight gain as the difference 
between maternal weight at antenatal booking and the 
last weight measured before delivery. We accepted the 
primary authors’ definition and reporting of gestational 
diabetes mellitus, pregnancy induced hypertension, 
pre-eclampsia, caesarean section, stillbirth, and 
admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. We defined 
preterm delivery as birth before 37 weeks of gestation, 
and small for gestational age and large for gestational 
age as babies with a birth weight below the 10th and 
at or over the 90th centiles, respectively, adjusted for 
mother’s BMI, parity, and gestational age at delivery.25
Establishment of IPD collaborative network and 
database—We established the International Weight 
Management in Pregnancy IPD Collaborative Group 
by contacting researchers of eligible studies.26 A 
bespoke database was developed, and we requested 
collaborators for relevant data in any format. We sent 
three reminders when there was no response.
Quality assessment of the included studies
Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of the 
randomised trials using a risk of bias tool for sequence 
generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete 
outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other 
potential sources of bias.27 We considered a study to 
have a high risk of bias if it scored as such in at least one 
of the following domains: randomisation, allocation 
concealment, blinding of outcome assessment, or 
incomplete outcome data; all items should be scored as 
low risk for a study to be classified as low risk of bias.
Data extraction and assessment of IPD integrity
Two independent reviewers (ER and NM) undertook 
data extraction at study level for inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, the characteristics of the intervention, and 
the reported outcomes. We sought to obtain IPD from 
relevant studies published until July 2015, which was 
the endpoint for IPD acquisition, to allow sufficient time 
for data cleaning, standardisation, and amalgamation 
of datasets. We also extracted the published study level 
data for all relevant studies published until February 
2017, including those published beyond the individual 
data acquisition timeline, and those for which IPD 
were not provided by study authors.
We 
obtained 
IPD 
for 
individual 
maternal 
characteristics that were determined a priori, such as 
BMI, age, parity, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and 
pre-existing medical conditions. Continuous variables 
were kept continuous, but some were also categorised 
when considered to be clinically useful. These included 
categorisations based on BMI (normal 18.5-24.9 kg/m2, 
overweight 25-29.9 kg/m2, obese ≥30 kg/m2) and age 
(cut-off 20 years). Mother’s ethnicity was classified as 
white or non-white. We used the mother’s educational 
status to indicate socioeconomic status: low status if 
the mother did not complete secondary education to A 
level, medium if she completed secondary education 
(A level equivalent), and high if she completed any 
further higher education. We defined pre-existing 
medical conditions as diabetes mellitus, early onset of 
gestational diabetes, or hypertension.
We considered participants to be adherent to 
the intervention based on the following criteria:

completion of at least 70% of the intervention 
protocol, dataset provided information on adherence 
in a yes or no format, or participant was deemed to 
be adherent as per the study criteria. We performed 
range and consistency checks on all IPD and produced 
summary tables. The randomisation ratio, baseline 
characteristics, and method of analysis in the IPD 
dataset were compared with the published information. 
Any discrepancies, missing data, obvious errors, and 
inconsistencies between variables or outlying values 
were queried and rectified as necessary with input 
from the original authors.
Data synthesis
To obtain summary estimates (mean difference for 
gestational weight gain and odds ratios for binary 
outcomes) and 95% confidence intervals for the 
intervention effects for each primary outcome we 
undertook a two stage IPD meta-analysis.21 We 
assessed the effects across all interventions overall 
and for individual interventions. A two stage IPD meta-
analysis was used to obtain summary estimates of 
the subgroup effects (interactions) of interest, which 
compared differential effects of interventions across the 
primary outcomes. Additionally we evaluated whether 
there are any differential effects of interventions for 
individual complications, according to BMI (normal, 
overweight, obese). All analyses were designed to 
preserve the intention to treat principle.
The first stage of the two stage meta-analysis involved 
analysing the IPD in each trial separately, to account 
for the clustering of participants within trials, and to 
obtain the estimates of interest and their variances. For 
the cluster randomised trials, we included a random 
intercept for a unit of randomisation to account for 
this further clustering. For the outcome of gestational 
weight gain, we used analysis of covariance in each 
trial to regress the final weight value against the 
intervention while adjusting for baseline weight and 
centres in cluster randomised trials. For maternal and 
offspring outcomes, we used a logistic regression model 
for each trial separately, with the intervention as a 
covariate. We excluded women with confirmed glucose 
intolerance or a hypertensive disorder at baseline, 
as defined by the primary authors, in the analysis of 
composite adverse pregnancy outcomes. To assess 
potential intervention effect modifiers, we extended 
the aforementioned models to include interaction 
terms between participant level covariates and the 
intervention (ie, treatment-covariate interaction terms).
In the second stage, we pooled the derived effect 
estimates (ie, treatment effects or treatment-covariate 
interactions) across trials using a random effects 
model fitted using restricted maximum likelihood. The 
random effects approach allowed us to account for 
unexplained interstudy heterogeneity in effects across 
studies. This produced summary estimates and 95% 
confidence intervals for the intervention effects and the 
interactions (subgroup effects). The Hartung-Knapp 
correction was applied when subsequently deriving 
95% confidence intervals for the true mean effect, 
to help account for the uncertainty of the estimate of 
interstudy heterogeneity.28 29
We included studies that did not contribute IPD, by 
incorporating their extracted study level data within 
the second stage of the IPD meta-analysis framework, 
to obtain summary estimates of intervention effects 
that combined IPD and non-IPD studies. Sensitivity 
analyses were also performed by excluding studies 
with high risk of bias, analysing the primary outcomes 
separately for each intervention type (diet, physical 
activity, and mixed), excluding participants not 
adherent to the intervention, by analysing change in 
BMI instead of weight gain, and excluding maternal 
weight gain estimates from pregnancies that ended 
before 37 completed weeks of gestation to avoid 
systematic differences.
Heterogeneity was summarised using the I2 
statistic, the estimated interstudy variance (τ2),30 and 
approximate 95% prediction intervals, which indicate 
the potential intervention (or interaction) effect in a 
new population similar to those included in the meta-
analysis.31
Small study effects (potential publication bias) were 
investigated by using contour enhanced funnel plots 
alongside visual examination and statistical tests for 
asymmetry (Egger’s test for continuous outcomes or 
Peter’s test for binary outcomes).32 We assessed for IPD 
availability bias by comparing the summary results 
when including non-IPD studies with those from IPD 
studies.33 Furthermore, we compared the symmetry 
of funnel plots before and after inclusion of non-IPD 
studies. All meta-analyses were undertaken using Stata 
software version 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, 
USA), and statistical significance was considered at the 
5% level.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were they 
involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or 
implementation of the study. A patient representative 
provided an input to the interpretation and writing up 
of results. There are no plans to disseminate the results 
of the research to study participants or the relevant 
patient community. It was not evaluated whether 
the studies included in the review had any patient 
involvement.
Results
Study selection

More than 80% of women in the IPD meta-analyses 
were of white origin, and at least half were classified 
as of high socioeconomic status. Around 45% of 
women were nulliparous, 40% were obese, and a 
similar proportion was classified as having sedentary 
status with no exercise at baseline (table 1). IPD 
were available to assess the effects of interventions 
on gestational weight gain (33 studies, 9320 
women), maternal composite outcomes (24 studies, 
8852 women), and offspring composite outcomes 
(18 studies, 7981 women). The largest IPD were 
available for the outcome of large for gestational 
age fetus (34 studies, 12 047 women), followed by 
preterm delivery (32 studies, 11 676 women), small 
for gestational age fetus (33 studies, 11 666 women), 
any caesarean section (32 studies, 11 410 women), 
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (22 studies, 
9618 women), and gestational diabetes (27 studies, 
9427 women). We did not have access to IPD for 
51% of all eligible women (12 960/25 486) from 67 
studies (fig 1).
Quality of included studies
Overall, trials had a low risk of bias in random 
sequence generation (71%, 73/103). More than 90% 
(34/36) of studies that contributed to the IPD were 
assessed as low risk of bias in this domain compared 
with 58% (28/67) of the non-IPD studies. Two IPD 
studies (2/36) and one non-IPD study (3/67) were 
considered high risk for allocation concealment. 
Blinding of outcome assessment was appropriate 
in 44% (16/36) of IPD and 33% (22/67) of non-IPD 
studies (fig 2). Fewer IPD studies (5/36) were assessed 
as high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data than 
non-IPD studies (15/67). Figure 2 shows the summary 
of the risk of bias estimates for all eligible studies 
and those that did and did not contribute to IPD. We 
did not encounter any issues that we were not able 
to clarify with the IPD contributor during the IPD 
integrity check.

Effects of interventions on pregnancy outcomes
Gestational weight gain
Based on IPD meta-analysis (33 studies, 9320 women), 
diet and physical activity based interventions resulted 
in significantly less gestational weight gain compared 
with control (summary mean difference −0.70 kg, 95% 
confidence interval −0.92 to −0.48 kg, I2=14.1%), 
after adjusting for baseline weight and clustering. The 
approximate 95% prediction interval for the intervention 
effect in a new setting was −1.24 to −0.16 kg (table 2).
Differential effects in subgroups
No strong evidence was found of a treatment-covariate 
interaction for baseline BMI when treated as a 
continuous covariate (−0.02 kg change in intervention 
effect per one unit increase in BMI, 95% confidence 
interval −0.08 to 0.04 kg), or when compared as 
overweight versus normal (−0.11 kg, −0.77 to 0.55 kg), 
obese versus normal (0.06 kg, −0.90 to 1.01 kg), and 
obese versus overweight (−0.09 kg, −1.05 to 0.86 kg). 
We also did not observe evidence of a subgroup effect 
for age (−0.03 kg per one year increase in age, 95% 
confidence interval −0.08 to 0.02 kg), parity (0.10 kg 
change in effect for multiparity versus nulliparity, 95% 
confidence interval −0.39 to 0.60 kg), ethnicity (0.05 
kg change in effect for non-white versus white, 95% 
confidence interval −1.27 to 1.37 kg), and underlying 
medical condition (1.51 kg change in effect for 
women with at least one condition versus none, 95% 
confidence interval −2.01 to 5.02 kg). The findings 
were consistent when continuous covariates were 
analysed as categorical measures based on clinically 
relevant cut points (table 3).
Sensitivity analyses
The reduction in gestational weight gain owing to the 
intervention was consistently observed when the analysis 
was restricted to studies with low risk of bias (−0.67 kg, 
95% confidence interval −0.95 to −0.38 kg; 15 studies, 
5585 women), women adherent to the intervention 
(−0.76 kg, −1.00 to −0.52 kg; 33 studies, 8565 women), 
women followed up until more than 37 weeks’ gestation 
(−0.91 kg, −1.17 to −0.66 kg; 28 studies, 5324 women), 
and for BMI instead of maternal weight as an outcome 
(−0.30 kg/m2, −0.39 to −0.21 kg/m2; 31 studies, 9238 
women).

Addition of studies that did not contribute IPD
In meta-analysis undertaken by supplementing the 
IPD with study level data from studies (48 studies, 
8210 women) that did not contribute IPD, we observed 
a larger beneficial intervention effect for weight gain 
(summary mean difference −1.1 kg; 95% confidence 
interval −1.46 to −0.74 kg; 81 studies, 17 530 
women). The benefit was also consistently observed 
for individual interventions based on diet, physical 
activity, or mixed approach (table 2).
Maternal and offspring composite outcomes
In the IPD meta-analyses, the summary estimates 
favoured the intervention group for reduction in odds 
of maternal (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 
0.79 to 1.03, I2=26.7%; 24 studies, 8851 women) and 
offspring composite outcomes (0.94, 0.83 to 1.08, 
I2=0%; 18 studies, 7981 women), but these were not 
statistically significant (table 4).
Differential effects across subgroups
We observed no strong evidence of differential 
subgroup effects for maternal composite outcome 
according to either baseline BMI (treatment-covariate 
interaction 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 
1.02), age (1.01, 0.99 to 1.03), parity (1.03, 0.75 to 
1.39), ethnicity (0.93, 0.63 to 1.37), and underlying 
medical condition (1.44, 0.15 to 13.74) (table 5).
A similar lack of differential effect was observed 
for offspring composite outcome in mothers grouped 
according to baseline BMI (interaction 0.98, 95% 
confidence interval 0.95 to 1.00), age (1.01, 0.98 to 
1.04), parity (0.94, 0.64 to 1.37), ethnicity (1.12, 0.75 
to 1.68), and underlying medical condition (0.58, 
0.03 to 9.81) (table 4). The findings did not change 
for maternal and offspring composite outcomes when 
BMI and age were analysed as continuous instead of 
categorical variables.
Individual maternal outcomes
Overall, in the IPD meta-analysis we observed a 
significant reduction in caesarean section (odds 
ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.99, 
I2=0%; 32 studies, 11 410 women) for interventions 
compared with routine care. The reduction in other 
individual outcomes such as gestational diabetes 
(0.89, 0.72 to 1.10, I2=23.8%; 27 studies, 9427 
women), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (0.95, 
0.78 to 1.16, I2=24.2%; 22 studies, 9618 women), 
and preterm delivery (0.94, 0.78 to 1.13, I2=17.3%; 
32 studies, 11 676 women) were not statistically 
significant in IPD meta-analyses (table 5). We did not 
observe any differential effect according to baseline 
BMI category (normal, overweight, obese) for any of 
the individual maternal outcomes (see web appendix 
3). The findings were consistent when study level data 
from non-IPD studies were meta-analysed with IPD, 
but with a stronger evidence of benefit for gestational 
diabetes. The reduction in gestational diabetes (0.76, 
0.65 to 0.89, 36.8%; 59 studies, 16 885 women) 
became significant (table 5).
Among individual interventions, those based mainly 
on physical activity showed a reduction in gestational 
diabetes in both IPD (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence 
interval 0.46 to 0.99, I2=0%; 10 studies, 2700 women) 
and in combined (IPD and non-IPD) meta-analyses 
(0.66, 0.53 to 0.83, I2=0%; 27 studies, 6755 women). 
While the summary estimates for physical activity 
based interventions favoured caesarean section (0.82, 
0.67 to 1.01, I2=0%; 13 studies, 3046 women) and 
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (0.74, 0.42 to 
1.33, I2=6.0%; 7 studies, 2565 women) in IPD meta-
analyses, the addition of non-IPD studies resulted in 
stronger evidence of benefit for these complications, 
with reduction in the respective odds by 17% (0.83, 
0.73 to 0.95, I2=0%; 32 studies, 6587 women) and 
32% (0.68, 0.49 to 0.93, I2=0%; 20 studies, 5125 
women).
A strong effect was observed for preterm birth with 
diet based interventions in both IPD (odds ratio 0.28, 
95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.96, I2=0%; 4 studies, 
1344 women) and combined analyses (0.32, 0.14 to 
0.70, I2=0%; 7 studies, 1696 women), but the overall 
sample sizes were relatively small (table 5). There was 
no evidence of benefit with mixed interventions for any 
maternal outcomes.
Individual offspring outcomes
No strong evidence was found that interventions 
had an effect on individual offspring outcomes 
such as stillbirth (odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence 
interval <0.001 to 256.69, I2=0%; 2 studies, 3719 
women), small for gestational age fetus (1.06, 0.94 
to 1.20, I2=0%; 33 studies, 11 666 women), large for 
gestational age fetus (0.90, 0.76 to 1.07, I2=38.0%; 
34 studies, 12 047 women), and admission to a 
neonatal intensive care unit (1.01, 0.84 to 1.23, 
I2=0%; 16 studies, 8140 women) based on the IPD 
meta-analyses. The significance of the findings did 
not change when non-IPD studies were added to 
the IPD meta-analyses (table 5). The numbers of 
eligible participants for whom data were obtained, 
effect estimates, and confidence intervals for all 
above analyses are available from the study authors 
on request. There was no differential effect for any 
individual offspring outcome according to the BMI 
category (see web appendix 3).
Small study effects
We found visual and statistical evidence (Egger’s test 
P=0.04) of small study effects in the contour enhanced 
funnel plots for the IPD meta-analysis of the overall 
effect on gestational weight gain. The asymmetry of 
the plot was not improved by the addition of study 
level data from non-IPD studies to the meta-analysis. 
When studies with high risk of bias were excluded 
from the analysis, the symmetry of the funnel plot 
improved (Egger’s test P=0.61). We found significant 
evidence of small study effects for the maternal 
composite outcome (Peter’s test P=0.04), but not for 
the offspring composite outcome (P=0.85) (see web 
appendix 4).

Discussion
Our large, collaborative individual participant data 
(IPD) meta-analysis confirms that diet and physical 
activity based interventions in pregnancy reduce 
gestational weight gain. This beneficial effect was 
consistently observed irrespective of maternal 
body mass index (BMI), age, parity, ethnicity, or 
pre-existing medical condition; and remained 
when studies at high risk of bias were excluded. 
The findings are generalisable, with the 95%

prediction interval suggesting a beneficial effect 
on gestational weight gain when the intervention 
is applied in a new population or setting. There is 
no strong evidence that interventions reduce the 
risk of maternal and offspring composite outcomes, 
with no variation in effect observed across the 
subgroups.
For individual outcomes, interventions reduce 
caesarean section without a statistically significant 
reduction 
in 
other 
maternal 
and 
offspring 
complications. The effects of interventions for 
individual maternal and offspring complications 
are consistent irrespective of the BMI of the mother. 
Addition of study level data from non-IPD studies 
to the IPD meta-analysis increased the precision of 
estimates, without a change in the direction of effect, 
and showed additional benefit for gestational diabetes. 
Among individual interventions, those mainly based 
on physical activity lowered the odds of gestational 
diabetes.
Strengths and weaknesses of this study
To our knowledge this is the first IPD meta-analysis 
to assess the differential effects of diet and physical 
activity based interventions for important, clinically 
relevant outcomes, in subgroups of women who were 
identified a priori. Establishment of the International 
Weight Management in Pregnancy IPD Collaborative 
Group facilitated the collaboration of key researchers 
in this area and provided access to the largest IPD 
in this specialty. This allowed us to extract data that 
were not published, with larger sample sizes for 
outcomes such as preterm birth, small and large for 
gestational age fetuses, and admission to the neonatal 
intensive care unit for IPD than for study level meta-
analysis. Furthermore, we were able to minimise 
the heterogeneity in the population by excluding 
individual women who did not fulfil the inclusion 
criteria. We compared the quality of studies that 
contributed to the IPD, which were generally of higher 
quality than those that did not contribute IPD.

Access to IPD provided us with substantially 
increased power (compared with individual trials) 
to robustly estimate treatment covariate interactions 
and to avoid the ecological bias observed in aggregate 
metaregression of study level covariates.19 21 It 
also allowed us to adjust for baseline weight using 
analysis of covariance in each trial,134 which is the 
best approach to analysing continuous outcomes,135 
although rarely used in individual trials. Our reporting 
of 95% prediction intervals for the overall and 
differential effects of interventions across subgroups 
allowed us to quantify the range of effects across 
populations of interest.
The subgroups were chosen in response to the call by 
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
for assessment of the effectiveness of lifestyle 
interventions in pregnancy for specific groups of 
women considered to be at high risk of complications, 
such as teenagers, those from ethnic minorities, and 
women who enter pregnancy obese.15 We assessed 
treatment-covariate interactions for subgroups as both 
continuous and categorical variables. We chose 20 
years as the cut-off for age, as it allowed us to assess 
the effect of intervention in young adults, where 
pregnancy may alter normal growth processes and 
increase the women’s risk of becoming overweight or 
obese.136 Adolescent mothers also retain more weight 
post partum than mature control participants.136
Owing to the variation in reporting, we were only 
able to broadly classify the ethnicity of women as white 
or non-white. Our findings were limited by the smaller 
number of non-white compared with white mothers. 
We combined diet based, physical activity based, and 
mixed approach interventions to provide an overall 
estimate, and also reported their individual effects.13 
137 Since more than one clinical outcome is considered 
to be important to clinical care, we assessed the effects 
of interventions on maternal and offspring composite 
outcomes, the individual components of which were 
identified through a robust Delphi process.24 The 
varying definitions may have an impact on findings 
for gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, where the 
cut-offs and the criteria for diagnosis differed. Another 
limitation is that the majority of our population has a 
medium to high education status, a factor favouring 
compliance with interventions.
IPD repository
By establishing the International Weight Management 
in Pregnancy IPD live repository through the support 
of the individual research teams, we ensured that in 
addition to the standardisation, data were robustly 
safeguarded. The continuing growth of the repository 
is crucial for future research in this area138 and will 
accelerate update of the meta-analysis for the various 
relevant outcomes as new studies are published. We 
were successful in obtaining individual data from 80% 
of all participants within the IPD acquisition timeline. 
While every effort was made to include IPD from the 
latest studies identified in the updated search, we were 
limited by the time needed to prepare the IPD datasets, 
which involved data access, setting up of institutional 
contracts, cleaning and formatting of accessed data, 
resolution of queries with individual researchers, 
and standardisation and merging of the data. This 
restricted our ability to include studies published after 
the agreed data acquisition timeline in the IPD meta-
analysis. In a high priority area such as obesity and 
weight gain in pregnancy, the number of published 
studies has increased rapidly, with at least 10 trials 
published each year since 2011, and 16 published in 
2016. We sought to maximise the information needed 
to inform the findings by combining study level data 
from non-IPD studies with the IPD meta-analyses. 
The conclusions appeared to be robust for nearly all 
outcomes. Furthermore, the non-availability of IPD 
from these studies did not appear to contribute to the 
observed small study effects, since the asymmetry 
of the funnel plot was not altered when the non-
IPD studies were added. Non-IPD studies were also 
generally at a higher risk of bias.
Gestational weight gain
Diet and physical activity based interventions reduce 
gestational weight gain. We have shown that this 
beneficial effect is observed in all women irrespective 
of maternal characteristics. The findings are consistent 
for any type of intervention, even when restricted to 
only high quality studies and to women adherent to 
the intervention, and when non-IPD are added to IPD. 
Mothers with excess weight gain in pregnancy are at 
increased risk of postpartum weight retention.139 This 
increase in interpregnancy BMI may contribute to risks 
of entering subsequent pregnancies as overweight 
or obese, with adverse outcomes in subsequent 
pregnancy.140 Furthermore, this may increase women’s 
risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in 
later life.141 Compared with published evidence,13 we 
identified a smaller reduction in gestational weight 
gain of 0.7 kg with interventions. The effect of such a 
reduction in gestational weight gain (compared with 
routine care) on postpartum weight retention and long 
term outcomes is not known.
Maternal and offspring outcomes
Despite the summary effect estimates favouring the 
interventions for maternal and offspring composite 
outcomes, these were not statistically significant. 
Interventions significantly reduced the odds of 
caesarean 
section. 
Previous 
systematic 
reviews 
showed a trend towards reduction in this risk overall, 
and for individual interventions (diet, physical activity, 
or mixed approach),13 but were limited by the small 
sample sizes and paucity of reporting, compared with 
the 11 000 women included in our IPD meta-analysis. 
Of the individual interventions, physical activity 
in pregnancy showed a trend towards reduction in 
caesarean section in IPD meta-analysis, which became 
statistically significant with minimal heterogeneity 
when non-IPD were added. The physical activity 
component in most studies involved a structured 
exercise of moderate intensity (eg, aerobic classes or

stationary cycling) with resistance training that varied 
in frequency (see web appendix 5). The relatively small 
numbers of women in the diet only intervention may 
have contributed to the imprecision in estimates.
Although the direction of effect appeared to favour 
the intervention for other maternal outcomes, they were 
not statistically significant. Addition of non-IPD to the 
IPD meta-analysis resulted in a statistically significant 
reduction in gestational diabetes. However, unlike 
our IPD analysis, we were not able to implement the 
strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, standardise the 
analysis strategy (eg, adjust for baseline), or ascertain 
occurrence of outcome in the combined analysis with 
study level data. Physical activity based interventions 
statistically significantly reduced the odds of gestational 
diabetes in IPD meta-analysis, and also when combined 
with non-IPD. This benefit could be mediated through 
mechanisms that resulted in improved glycaemic 
variables and outcomes in type 4 and type 2 diabetes, 
through increased insulin sensitivity and reduced 
oxidative stress. Exercise in pregnancy may also have 
a potential role in preventing hypertensive disorders of 
pregnancy. The effects of diet and physical activity on 
maternal and offspring outcomes did not vary according 
to the BMI of the woman, highlighting the potential 
benefits for all and not selected groups of mothers.
Interventions based on diet showed a reduction 
in preterm birth, although the analysis included 
relatively small numbers of women. We did not identify 
any benefits with interventions in preventing any 
adverse offspring outcome, despite a sample size that 
was twofold to threefold more than published data for 
some outcomes, consistent with previous findings.14 
The lack of adverse effects such as small for gestational 
age and preterm birth with diet and physical activity 
in pregnancy should reassure mothers who have 
traditionally been advised not to undertake structured 
exercise or manage their diet in pregnancy.
Implications for clinical practice
Currently in the UK, only obese women are offered 
access to a dietician and specific antenatal classes for 
advice on diet and lifestyle, to minimise gestational 
weight gain. Based on our work, it is likely that women 
of all BMI groups could benefit from specific advice on 
diet and physical activity for weight gain, and some 
maternal outcomes. Healthcare professionals should 
avoid variations in care and lifestyle advice provided to 
mothers based on ethnicity, age, and underlying medical 
conditions, as no differential effects were found.
Discussions about diet and physical activity in 
pregnancy, which are delivered as part of antenatal 
care, should incorporate specific estimates of benefit 
for caesarean section and gestational weight gain, 
and the likelihood of preventing gestational diabetes. 
Mothers should be reassured about the safety of the 
interventions, particularly on physical activity and 
structured exercise in pregnancy, by highlighting 
the benefits and lack of harm. This may improve 
engagement and compliance with the intervention. 
Importantly, such interventions in pregnancy could 
be considered in global efforts to reduce caesarean 
section in relevant populations.
Implications for further research
Whether the observed benefit in gestational weight 
gain with diet and physical activity translates to 
long term benefits to the mother and child needs to 
be assessed. Evaluation of any differential effects 
according to the individual components of the 
intervention, such as duration, frequency, provider, 
and setting, on individual outcomes is required to 
provide detailed recommendations. The effects of these 
interventions on mothers in low and middle income 
countries, particularly in those countries with high 
rates of caesarean section and gestational diabetes, 
need to be ascertained from large randomised trials. 
There is a need to develop a harmonised core outcome 
set for future reporting of clinical trials in this area, to 
maximise the meaningful interpretation of published 
data. This is particularly relevant for rare but important 
outcomes such as shoulder dystocia, birth trauma, and 
venous thromboembolic events.
Conclusion
Diet and physical activity based interventions in 
pregnancy limit gestational weight gain, with no 
evidence that this effect differs across subgroups 
defined by maternal characteristics. The odds for 
caesarean section are also reduced.
