Children and adolescents may participate in sports that favor a particular 
body type. Some sports, such as gymnastics, dance, and distance running, 
emphasize a slim or lean physique for aesthetic or performance reasons. 
Participants in weight-class sports, such as wrestling and martial arts, 
may attempt weight loss so they can compete at a lower weight class. 
Other sports, such as football and bodybuilding, highlight a muscular 
physique; young athletes engaged in these sports may desire to gain weight 
and muscle mass. This clinical report describes unhealthy methods of 
weight loss and gain as well as policies and approaches used to curb these 
practices. The report also reviews healthy strategies for weight loss and 
weight gain and provides recommendations for pediatricians on how to 
promote healthy weight control in young athletes.
abstract
Young athletes who participate in sports that favor a particular body type 
may express a desire to lose or gain weight. Athletes who participate in 
“weight-sensitive” sports, which emphasize a lean, slim physique, often 
seek to lose weight. In aesthetic sports, such as gymnastics, figure skating, 
and diving, athletes may believe they will be judged more favorably if 
they have a lean body build. With other sports, distance running and 
cycling, for example, participants with a slim physique are perceived to 
have a greater ability to move the body against gravity if they weigh less. 
 
Table 1 lists examples of sports that typically favor a slim/lean build. For 
weight-class sports, including wrestling and martial arts, athletes often 
desire to compete at the lowest possible weight in the belief that lighter 
athletes have an increased strength-to-weight ratio (‍Table 2).
Football and powerlifting are examples of sports that highlight a muscular 
physique (‍Table 3). Children and adolescents who participate in sports 
that emphasize strength and power often attempt to gain weight and lean 
muscle mass to improve performance. Participants in bodybuilding may 
seek to increase muscle mass and definition for aesthetic reasons.
In their attempts to change body weight and composition, some athletes 
resort to unhealthy weight-control practices.1

 weight-control approaches may 
adversely affect health and, in 
some cases, can negatively affect 
performance. Pediatricians should 
have an awareness of safe and unsafe 
weight-control practices so they can 
counsel young athletes and family 
members appropriately.
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
(‍AAP) policy statement “Promotion 
of Healthy Weight Control in Young 
Athletes” was published in 1996 
and updated in 2005.7, 
 
8 This clinical 
report replaces the 2005 statement 
and includes more recent evidence 
about the detrimental effects of 
dehydration and the benefits of 
gradual weight loss as compared with 
acute weight loss. Data on the effects 
of collegiate and high school rule 
changes are also included.
WeighT Loss
Athletes may attempt to lose weight 
to enhance performance, to qualify 
for a particular weight class, or to 
change their appearance for a sport 
that emphasizes a lean physique. 
Weight loss becomes a problem when 
athletes are inadequately hydrated 
and/or when nutritional needs are 
not met. Table 4 lists healthy and 
unhealthy weight loss methods.
Unhealthy Weight Loss
Some weight loss methods can lead 
to serious physical and psychological 
harm. Additionally, certain weight 
loss practices impair athletic 
performance and increase injury risk. 
Weight loss may initially improve 
athletic performance because of an 
increase in the strength-to-weight 
ratio. However, continued use of 
inappropriate weight loss methods 
can result in reduced muscle 
strength, reduced performance in 
aerobic activities, decreased mental 
and cognitive performance, mood 
changes, depression, compromised 
immune response, and changes 
in the cardiovascular, endocrine, 
gastrointestinal, renal, and 
thermoregulatory systems.1

Weight Loss Attributable to Dehydration
Up to 67% of athletes involved 
in weight-class sports, such as 
wrestling, boxing, and weight-class 
crew, attempt to lose weight acutely 
with dehydration techniques.4 High 
school and college wrestlers report 
high rates of fasting, restricting fluid 
intake, and engaging in practices 
that increase sweating for acute 
weight loss.17, 
 
18 This process, 
referred to as “weight cutting, 
” 
allows competitors to weigh in at the 
lowest possible weight; most athletes 
subsequently attempt to regain 
weight by rehydrating between 
the weigh-in and competition. The 
term hypohydration refers to the 
state of suboptimal hydration, 
and dehydration describes the 
transition from a well-hydrated to 
a hypohydrated state.19 Examples 
of dehydration techniques include 
fluid restriction, spitting, vomiting, 
steam baths, saunas, using laxatives 
or diuretics, and wearing nonporous

Using these tactics over the course of 
several days can lead to progressive 
dehydration because many athletes 
fail to fully rehydrate each day.20

After 2 to 3 days of dehydration, 
replacement of intracellular fluids 
takes 48 hours.25
Athletes and coaches in weight-
class sports often harbor a belief 
that weighing in at the lowest 
possible weight will maximize 
strength-to-weight ratio and 
increase an athlete’s competitive 
advantage.4,

hydration has been shown to 
decrease athletic performance; 
aerobic function is impaired more 
than anaerobic performance.26

National Sport Governing Bodies 
Address Rapid Weight Loss Attributable 
to Dehydration and/or Hypohydration
In 1997, over the course of 33 days, 
3 college wrestlers died as a result 
of attempting drastic weight loss 
before competition.40 In response to 
these deaths, the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association (‍NCAA) 
instituted new rules designed to 
curb the practice of acute weight 
loss; the rules were implemented in 
1998 and updated in the 2003–2004 
and 2013–2014 rule books.41 The 
updated NCAA rules banned the use 
of diuretics, impermeable suits, and 
saunas for weight loss and decreased 
the amount of time between weigh-
ins and competition. Additionally, 
the NCAA established a system 
of setting a minimum weight for 
competition during the wrestling 
season by using a calculation that 
incorporates hydration status 
(‍based on urinespecific gravity), 
weight, and body composition. 
Before the competition season, 
athletes submit a urine sample from 
a witnessed collection for testing. If 
the urinespecific gravity is 1.020 or 
less, the athlete is considered well 
hydrated and can weigh in. Body fat 
is measured by using 1 of 3 methods: 
skin fold caliper measurement by 
a trained evaluator, hydrostatic 
(‍underwater) weighing, or air 
displacement plethysmography 
(‍commonly performed by using 
a Bod Pod device). Body fat and 
weight are entered into an online 
optimal performance calculator 
and are used to calculate the lowest 
allowable weight (‍LAW) by using 
2 different methods. The LAW1 
formula incorporates the minimum 
body fat of 5% allowed by the 
NCAA. The LAW2 accounts for the 
1.5% body weight loss per week 
permitted during the season. The 
highest of these calculated weights 
is the lowest weight allowed for 
competition during the wrestling 
season.41, 
 
42 Table 6 provides a list of 
the variables and the equations used 
in the calculation of LAW1 and LAW2 
for reference.
In the high school wrestling arena, 
the Wisconsin Interscholastic 
Athletic Association was the first 
state high school athletic association 
to implement a plan to curtail 
weight cutting among high school 
wrestlers.43 The National Federation 
of State High School Associations 
adopted guidelines that apply to 
high schools in all states in 2006. 
High school wrestlers must have 
a urinespecific gravity of 1.025 or 
less for their preseason weigh-in. 
Minimum body fat during the 
wrestling season is set at 7% for 
boys and 12% for girls. As with 
NCAA athletes, high school wrestlers 
may lose no more than 1.5% of 
body weight per week. Additionally, 
there is a 2-lb growth allowance 
for each weight class per season.

 High schools are permitted to use 
bioelectrical impedance analysis as 
an alternative to skin fold caliper 
and air displacement options to 
determine body fat percentage.44 
Some individual states have adopted 
stricter policies and require a 
urinespecific gravity of 1.020 or 
lower before weigh-ins.45, 
 
46
The establishment of minimum 
competition weight rules has led to 
a decrease in the practice of rapid 
weight loss before competition.47, 
 
48  
However, the urinespecific gravity 
measurements of 1.020 and 
1.025 required by the NCAA and 
National Federation of State High 
School Associations for weigh-ins, 
respectively, do not correspond with 
ideal hydration status. An optimally 
hydrated athlete should have a 
urinespecific gravity of ∼1.010 and 
a urine osmolality of 300 mOsm/L.49 
Some athletes may use diuretics to 
produce dilute urine. Additionally, 
consuming a large quantity of plain 
water over a short period of time 
leads to lower serum osmolality 
and increased urine output and 
dilution.50, 
51 This practice may result 
in a low urinespecific gravity test 
result in a dehydrated athlete.
There is no agreed-on gold 
standard for the assessment of body 
composition. Skinfold measurement 
is an inexpensive, well-validated 
method that is commonly used in 
the high school and collegiate setting 
to determine body composition. 
However, skinfold measurement 
requires trained personnel and may 
not be as accurate for individuals 
with obesity.28, 
 
29, 
 
52 In addition, there 
are racial and ethnic differences in 
the location of body mass storage 
and fat deposition that affect skin 
fold measurements.53, 
54 Hydrostatic 
(‍underwater) weight and air 
displacement plethysmography 
are simple to perform but require 
expensive equipment; both 
methods may underestimate body 
fat percentage in extremely lean 
athletes. High schools are allowed to 
use bioelectrical impedance analysis 
to measure body fat percentage; 
this technique is less accurate than 
others, and hydration status can 
affect the results.52, 
 
55 Dual-energy 
radiograph absorptiometry (‍DXA) is 
accurate, nonintrusive, and easy to 
perform; but DXA scanning involves a 
small amount of radiation exposure, 
and athletes over 192 cm (‍73.5 in) 
may not fit into standard scanners.52 
The most precise way to determine 
body composition is by using several 
different methods (‍a multicomponent 
model), such as skinfold 
measurements, DXA, and waist 
circumference measurements.27, 
56  
However, the multicomponent 
method is rarely feasible in the 
clinical setting. Body composition is 
most accurately calculated with serial 
measurements that use the same 
assessment technique performed by 
an experienced health care provider, 
such as an exercise physiologist, 
athletic trainer, registered dietitian 
nutritionist (‍RDN), or sports 
medicine physician.52
Changing the timing of 
precompetition weigh-ins to 
immediately before matches has been 
proposed as a means of decreasing 
the incentive to cut weight.4 Using 
a random draw to determine 
the order in which athletes of 
different weight classes compete 
could also spur athletes to avoid 
purposeful dehydration before sport 
participation.42
Unhealthy Weight Loss Attributable to 
Inadequate Energy (Caloric) Availability
Many athletes attempt to lose weight 
by restricting energy (‍caloric) intake. 
Athletes typically need a greater 
caloric intake than nonathletes.9, 
 
27, 
 
57  
The actual energy requirement 
depends on the athlete’s body 
composition, weight, height, age, 
stage of growth, and level of fitness, 
as well as the intensity, frequency, 
and duration of exercise activity.9, 
57  
Athletes need to eat enough to cover 
the energy costs of daily living, 
growth, remodeling bone, building 
and repairing muscle tissue, and 
participating in sports.9, 
 
57, 
 
58
Unhealthy weight loss behaviors 
occur along a continuum. At one end 
of the spectrum are individuals with 
a mild energy imbalance: caloric 
intake is not sufficient to cover the 
body’s energy requirements. At 
the other end of the spectrum are 
athletes engaging in dangerous 
weight loss practices that carry a 
high risk of associated morbidity 
and mortality; this extreme includes 
children and adolescents with frank 
eating disorders, such as anorexia 
nervosa and bulimia nervosa.17, 
 
59 
– 
63 
In addition to fasting or restricting 
calories, risky weight loss practices 
include vomiting after eating, 
performing excessive exercise, 
and the use of diuretic, laxative, or 
stimulant medications. Persistent 
weight loss via unhealthy behaviors 
may result in delayed physical 
maturation, growth impairment, 
and the development of eating 
disorders.2, 
 
3,

The “female athlete triad” (‍triad) is a 
term that describes the combination 
of low energy availability, menstrual 
dysfunction, and low bone mineral 
density. When first described, 
the 3 facets of the triad included 
disordered eating, amenorrhea, 
and osteoporosis.64 The definition 
was subsequently altered to 
reflect the spectrum of low energy 
availability and its consequences 
in female athletes.63, 
 
65 Low energy 
availability refers to an imbalance 
between caloric intake and energy 
expenditure. A small body of research 
supports the concept that male 
athletes also appear to be susceptible 
to inadequate energy availability 
and may experience adverse health 
consequences as a result.66, 
67
A survey of female high school 
athletes revealed that one third had 
disordered eating; disordered eating 
was correlated with an increased 
risk of musculoskeletal injury.68

 Menstrual irregularities and low 
bone mineral density, also features 
of the female athlete triad, have been 
associated with higher injury risk.69 
The AAP statement “The Female 
Athlete Triad” provides an in-depth 
review of energy deficiency and 
eating disorders in female athletes.70
Although female athletes have the 
highest rates of eating disorders, 
male athletes are also at risk. In a 
study of 677 elite adolescent athletes, 
female athletes exhibited higher 
rates of eating disorders than male 
athletes (‍14% vs 3.2%), and both 
groups had a greater risk than their 
nonathlete peers (‍5.1% of female 
controls and 0% of male controls).71 
Male elite athletes in weight-class 
sports demonstrated higher rates 
of subclinical and clinical eating 
disorders than athletes participating 
in endurance sports or ball game 
sports, such as handball, soccer, and 
volleyball (‍18% for weight-class 
athletes vs 9% and 5% for endurance 
and ball game athletes, respectively). 
In the same study, 42% of female 
athletes involved in aesthetic sports, 
such as gymnastics, met the criteria 
for an eating disorder as compared 
with 30% of females in weight-class 
sports and 16% involved in ball game 
sports.72 Male collegiate athletes in 
weight-control sports have high rates 
of subclinical eating disorders (‍16%) 
and high rates of pathologic weight-
control practices, including binge 
eating, fasting, and strict dieting.73

designed to screen for disordered 
eating and menstrual irregularities.74, 
 
75  
Weight, height, and BMI can also be 
plotted on a growth chart at each 
office visit, and abnormal trends 
can be identified. BMI less than the 
fifth percentile, BMI less than 17.5 
in a skeletally mature adolescent, or 
weight less than 85% of expected 
body weight would warrant further 
evaluation for unhealthy weight loss 
behavior.16, 
 
63
Education of athletes, parents, and 
coaches about unhealthy weight loss 
behaviors and their negative impact 
on health and athletic performance 
is important to prevent adverse 
health effects. For non–weight-class 
sports, coaches should promote 
healthy eating habits and be alert 
to unhealthy eating habits in their 
athletes. Coaches of weight-class 
sports should discourage unhealthy 
weight-control methods and 
encourage athletes to compete at a 
weight that is appropriate for their 
age, height, physique, and stage of 
growth and development. Many 
coaches inappropriately focus on 
weight instead of performance. 
In addition, coaches generally do 
not have an adequate nutritional 
background to counsel an athlete 
about weight loss. Coaches’ 
discussions of weight loss with 
athletes may increase the risk of 
harmful weight loss practices.76, 
 
77
Athletes should focus on optimizing 
energy availability for maximizing 
performance and good health. Female 
athletes with menstrual dysfunction 
require an evaluation to determine 
the underlying etiology. If low energy 
availability is the cause, increasing 
energy intake will generally lead to 
resumption of normal menses.65, 
 
70 
If an eating disorder is suspected, 
referral to a multidisciplinary team 
of experts in this field, including a 
physician, RDN, and mental health 
provider, is appropriate. Referral to 
an RDN may be of benefit to assist 
athletes with a well-designed, healthy 
weight loss program or to provide 
guidance on increasing caloric 
intake, when appropriate. The AAP 
clinical report, “Identification and 
Management of Eating Disorders in 
Children and Adolescents, 
” discusses 
the diagnosis and treatment of 
eating disorders in the pediatric 
population.16 Recommendations 
have also been published on return-
to-play criteria in female athletes 
with disordered eating, menstrual 
dysfunction, and decreased bone 
mineral density.61,

healthy Weight Loss in the Athlete 
Classified as having overweight or 
obesity
The AAP has published clinical 
reports that outline guidance for the 
prevention and treatment of obesity 
for all children and adolescents.78, 
 
79  
These AAP recommendations 
emphasize adherence to physical 
activity recommendations, healthy 
diet, and limits on screen time. For 
most children and adolescents, the 
goal of weight management should 
be to keep BMI below the 85th 
percentile. Recommendations for 
weight maintenance and weight loss 
are based on the degree of obesity.78
Excessive body fat may interfere with 
acclimation to heat and negatively 
affect speed, endurance, and work 
efficiency.6, 
 
9, 
 
27 Young athletes who 
are not classified as having obesity 
may strive to lose weight or increase 
lean body mass to improve sports 
performance. Because weight is not 
an accurate indicator of body fat, lean 
muscle mass, or performance, athletes 
should focus on maintaining lean 
muscle mass.27, 
57 Skeletally immature 
athletes should not be encouraged 
to lose weight to improve athletic 
performance. An imbalance between 
energy intake and energy expenditure 
can result in the loss of lean muscle 
mass, which can negatively affect 
performance.9, 
 
27, 
 
57 Changes in 
weight and body composition should 
be achieved gradually, by using 
sensible methods aimed at long-term 
change. Athletes should avoid cyclic

Gradual weight loss appears to 
confer greater performance benefits 
than rapid weight loss. A study of 
athletes engaged in strength training 
demonstrated that weight reduction of 
0.7% of body weight per week results 
in increased lean body mass and

weight reduction of 1.4% body weight

and athletes who are mature can lose 
up to 2 lb per week.27, 
 
57
Adult athletes generally require a 
minimum of 2000 kcal per day, but 
this can vary widely depending on 
sex and level of activity.80 Caloric 
requirements for active children 
and adolescents differ depending 
on age and stage of growth; caloric 
requirements peak in adolescence 
and early adulthood. Type and 
intensity of physical activity will 
also influence caloric needs. The US 
Department of Agriculture provides 
an online interactive tool for health 
care providers to calculate an 
individual’s caloric needs on the 
basis of sex, age, and activity level 
(‍https:// 
fnic. 
nal. 
usda. 
gov/ 
fnic/ 
interactiveDRI/ 
).
Approximately 55% to 65% of energy 
(‍calories), or 6 to 10 g/kg per day, 
should be from carbohydrates; 15% 
to 20%, or 0.85 to 1.7 g/kg per day, 
should be from protein, and 20% to 
35%, or 1 g/kg per day, should be 
from fat.9, 
 
27, 
 
57 The diet should be 
well balanced and consist of a variety 
of foods. Young athletes attempting 
to lose weight may benefit from 
the guidance of a RDN with sports 
nutrition experience.81
WeighT gAin
Athletes involved in sports such 
as football, rugby, power lifting, 
and bodybuilding may desire to 
gain weight and lean muscle mass 
to improve power and strength or 
to achieve a muscular physique. 
Preadolescent and adolescent 
athletes who want to gain weight 
may require guidance about 
appropriate, healthy strategies for 
achieving their goals. Table 7 lists 
healthy and unhealthy methods of 
weight gain.
Unhealthy Weight gain
Increasing caloric intake in the form 
of food consumption or use of dietary 
supplements may lead to excessive 
fat accumulation rather than the 
desired increase in lean muscle 
mass.57 Excess body fat can have 
a negative effect on overall health 
and athletic performance.27 Often, 
athletes use over-the-counter dietary 
supplements to increase lean body 
mass. Supplement manufacturers are 
not required to prove safety before 
bringing their products to the market. 
Many supplements, even those sold 
by national retailers, contain unlisted, 
potentially harmful ingredients.82 In 
1 analysis, 20% of drug-related liver 
injuries resulting in hospitalization 
were associated with use of dietary 
supplements.83 Young athletes 
may use illegal and dangerous 
medications to gain weight and 
increase muscle mass. Adolescent 
males who perceive themselves as 
under- or overweight are nearly 4 
times more likely to use anabolic 
steroids to attempt to change body 
composition as compared with 
those who perceive themselves as 
being at an appropriate weight.84 
The AAP policy statement “Use of 
Performance-Enhancing Substances” 
reviews the risks of supplements 
and drugs used for weight gain in 
detail; Table 8 provides a summary of 
performance-enhancing substances 
and their effects adapted from this 
statement.85
healthy Weight gain
Young athletes in sports in which 
a muscular physique is valued for 
aesthetic or performance reasons 
may seek to gain weight and 
increase lean body mass through 
a combination of increased caloric 
intake and strength training. An 
athlete’s stage of development, 
genetic factors, type of training, diet, 
and motivation are all factors that 
influence weight gain and muscle 
development.57, 
 
83, 
 
86, 
 
87
Female athletes and prepubertal 
male athletes typically increase 
strength with a weight-training 
program but generally do not have 
sufficient circulating androgens to 
increase muscle bulk considerably.88 
Athletes with a slender body build 
(‍ectomorphs) will have more 
difficulty increasing muscle mass

Summary of Performance-Enhancing Substances Commonly Used by Athletes With Effects on Performance and Possible Adverse Effects
Substance
Usual Form of Intake
Purported Mechanism of 
Performance Effect
Data on Performance Effects
Potential Adverse Effects
Creatine
Creatine is found in meat 
and fish. About 3–5 g/kg 
uncooked meat or fish. 
Cooking can degrade 
some creatine in food. 
Generally about 1 g/d 
found in omnivore diet
Delays onset of muscle fatigue 
during high-intensity training 
by adenosine triphosphate 
production in high intensity 
activities that rely upon 
phosphocreatine shuttle
Performance benefit in 
most studies is small 
and primarily seen in 
short-duration, maximum-
intensity resistance 
training.34 No benefit 
generally shown in aerobic 
activities or with “on-field” 
athletic performance
Short-term use at usual doses appears safe in normal adults, but has not been 
evaluated specifically in the pediatric population. Most concern with impact on 
kidneys because of nephrotic metabolites (methylamine and formaldehyde), and 
specific recommendation against use for athletes at risk for kidney dysfunction.35 
May impair performance in endurance activities. Causes water retention.
Orally ingested creatine 
monohydrate supplement
Anabolic agents
Variety of testosterone 
derivatives. Schedule III 
drugs. Oral, injectable, 
buccal, and transdermal 
forms. Multiple forms 
often taken in “stacks” in 
6- to 12-wk cycles
Enhances net protein synthesis 
by increasing transcription 
and decreasing catabolism
Increased strength and lean 
muscle mass
Possible long-term effects on brain remodeling with adolescent AAS exposure. 
Premature physeal closure with decreased final adult height. Acne. Gynecomastia 
(irreversible). Hair loss/male pattern baldness (irreversible). Hypogonadism. 
Dependence. Behavior change (hypomania, irritability, aggression). Cardiomyopathy. 
Increased low-density lipoproteins/decreased high-density lipoproteins. Cholestatic 
jaundice, liver tumors.
Prohormones
Variety of substances often 
taken in combination 
(“stacks”) and in cyclical 
fashion
Purported to enhance 
testosterone concentrations 
after ingestion as well as 
potential direct anabolic 
effects
Androstenedione and DHEA: 
repeated dosages do not 
appear to increase blood 
testosterone concentrations 
or increase muscle size or 
strength36
Suppression of endogenous testosterone production, otherwise potentially same for 
testosterone as listed above.37 Supplements contaminated with prohormones are a 
common cause of doping violations in organized sports.36
All except for DHEA are now 
scheduled drugs as a 
result of the Anabolic 
Control Act of 2005 and 
Designer Anabolic Steroid 
Act of 2014
Caffeine/other 
stimulants
Caffeine is ubiquitous in 
a variety of food and 
beverages, as well as 
over-the-counter diet 
pills and “stay awake” 
medication
Currently believed that 
performance benefit 
primarily due to central 
nervous system stimulation 
and enhanced muscle 
activation
Most studies with caffeine 
have examined 3–6 mg/
kg, but 1–3 mg/kg has 
been shown to have 
performance-enhancing 
effects, particularly in 
endurance activity41
Tolerance. Cardiac arrhythmias (premature ventricular contractions) increased 
blood pressure. Headaches, irritability, sleep disruption, tremor. Gastric irritation. 
Increased core temperature with exertion, particularly in hot environments. 
Significant toxicity has been associated with ingestion of multiple energy drinks, 
leading to almost 1500 emergency department visits in 2011 in the 12- to 17-y age 
group.42 Increased availability of pure powdered caffeine is of particular concern 
and is responsible for at least 2 deaths in young people (1 teaspoon is equivalent to 
25 cups of coffee) (FDA warning).
Amphetamines often 
are diverted from 
prescription use
This includes 4% 
improvements in strength 
of knee extensors (note: 
other muscle groups 
did not show strength 
improvements with 
caffeine); 14% in muscular 
endurance; and 10%–20% 
improvements in time to 
exhaustion studies

tissue
HMB: meta-analysis of studies 
on young adults show 
untrained athletes with 
6.6% gains in strength, but 
only trivial strength impacts 
in trained athletes43
Ingestion of single amino acids may result in imbalance of others. Short-term ingestion 
of HMB appears safe at 6 g/d.45

Nitric oxide is a potent 
vasodilator. Synthesized 
from arginine via reduction 
to nitrate. Citrulline is an 
arginine precursor
Any potential benefit of 
arginine appears minimal in 
healthy young athletes who 
ingest sufficient protein.37

current data does not support restriction of vegetable source of nitrates.49
Buffers
Sodium bicarbonate or 
sodium citrate. Carnosine 
and β-alanine
Buffers the metabolic acidosis

To increase muscle mass, athletes 
must consume sufficient calories 
and include adequate proteins, 
carbohydrates, and fats.57, 
 
86, 
 
87 Weight 
gain needs to be gradual; gain in 
excess of 2 lb per week may result in 
increased body fat.27, 
57, 
 
87  
A male athlete could expect to gain 
0.5 lb to 1.0 lb of lean mass per 
week, and a female could expect 
to gain 0.25 lb to 0.75 lb of lean 
mass per week. Increased energy 
intake should always be combined 
with strength training to induce 
muscle growth. Children and 
adolescents who wish to engage in 
strength training should begin by 
learning proper technique without 
resistance. Weight loads should 
be increased gradually; programs 
should incorporate 2 to 3 sets of 8 
to 15 repetitions with the athlete 
maintaining proper technique. 
Although weight-training programs 
for children and adolescents have 
health and athletic performance 
benefits, the AAP recommends that 
skeletally immature children and 
adolescents avoid power lifting, 
bodybuilding, and maximal lifts.88 
Referral to an RDN may be helpful 
for athletes attempting to gain 
weight and increase lean body 
mass, particularly for those who 
have not been successful despite 
a seemingly appropriate strength-
training program, adequate rest, and 
a nutritionally sound diet.
WeighT, BMi, And Body CoMposiTion 
MeAsUreMenTs
Optimal weight, BMI, and body 
composition measures for athletic 
performance have yet to be 
determined, and sports performance 
measures may be the best indicator 
for an athlete’s optimal body 
composition and weight at his or her 
developmental stage. BMI, defined 
as weight in kilograms divided 
by height in meters squared, 
2 is a 
commonly applied screening tool 
used as a measure to assess general 
health. BMI values between the 
5th and 85th percentile for age are 
considered normal. The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention has 
published BMI charts that categorize 
BMIs on the basis of sex and age.89 
Although BMI is easy to measure in 
the clinical setting, abnormal values 
should be interpreted with caution. 
Approximately one-third of adults 
classified as having obesity on the 
basis of BMI measurement have good 
cardiac and metabolic health on the 
basis of other variables, such as blood 
pressure, cholesterol concentrations, 
and insulin resistance.90 BMI is 
a measure of weight relative to 
height but reveals nothing about 
body composition.27 Athletes, 
particularly those with a muscular 
build, are especially vulnerable to 
being misclassified as having obesity 
on the basis of BMI data because 
increased lean body mass increases 
BMI values. An increased torso-to-leg 
ratio also results in increased BMI. In 
adolescents, increased weight gain 
and increased height velocity during 
puberty may not coincide, resulting 
in temporary elevation or depression 
of BMI.91 In addition, BMI values in 
adolescents with eating disorders (‍or 
underweight adolescents) can result 
in an underestimation of the degree 
of malnutrition.92
Although there are normative data 
for body fat percentage, there are 
no established recommendations 
regarding body composition in 
children and adolescents.93 Body fat 
percentage varies by age. The average 
body fat in healthy adolescents 
without obesity ranges from ∼16% 
to 18% for males and ∼25% to 28% 
for females.57, 
 
94 The NCAA minimum 
allowable body fat percentage is 5% 
for male wrestlers. The minimum 
body fat percentage recommended 
by the National Federation of State 
High School Associations is 7% for 
male wrestlers and 12% for female 
wrestlers. These minimums are well 
under the fifth percentile for body fat 
observed in the general adolescent 
population. Rather than suggesting a 
specific percentage of body fat for an 
individual athlete, a range of values 
that is realistic and appropriate 
should be recommended.94
gUidAnCe for The CLiniCiAn
1. Physicians who care for young 
athletes are encouraged to have 
an understanding of healthy 
and unhealthy weight-control 
methods;
2. Health supervision visits for 
young athletes generally include 
history-taking to ascertain diet 
and physical activity patterns. 
When discussing diet and exercise, 
physicians can encourage 
parents of young athletes to place 
nutritional needs for growth 
and development above athletic 
considerations. Acute weight 
loss through dehydration and 
the use of potentially harmful 
medications and supplements for 
weight control should be strongly 
discouraged;
3. Physicians should counsel young 
athletes who express a desire 
to gain or lose weight to avoid 
weight-control methods that 
may have adverse health effects, 
such as acute weight loss through 
dehydration and the use of 
potentially harmful medications 
and supplements. Many of these 
methods may have a negative 
effect on performance as well;
4. Some states require a 
specific form for sports 
preparticipation examinations. 
For physicians in states without 
a specific requirement, the 
AAP Preparticipation Physical 
Examination monograph contains 
a standardized history-taking 
form that may be helpful for

When appropriate, pediatricians 
should advocate for the use of this 
form as the preferred tool for the

state and local level;
5. Physicians are encouraged to 
engage the services of RDNs 
familiar with athletes to help with 
complex weight-control issues, if 
these providers are available in 
their communities. Monitoring 
athletes with weight-control 
issues every 1 to 3 months can 
aid the physician in detecting 
excessive weight loss;
6. There are no established 
recommendations for body 
fat percentages in adolescent 
athletes. Rather than suggesting 
a specific percentage of body 
fat for an individual athlete, a 
range of values that is realistic 
and appropriate should be 
recommended;
7. Physicians should counsel young 
athletes that weight gain or 
weight loss regimens should be 
initiated early enough to permit 
gradual weight change before a 
sport season. Slow weight gain, 
in combination with strength 
training, will decrease gain of body 
fat. Slow weight loss in the athlete 
with excess body fat will decrease 
loss of muscle mass. A well-
balanced diet is recommended 
for all athletes. Once the desired 
weight is obtained, the athlete 
should attempt to maintain a 
constant weight; and
8. When opportunities for 
community education arise, 
pediatricians should collaborate 
with coaches and certified athletic 
trainers to encourage healthy 
eating and exercise habits.
