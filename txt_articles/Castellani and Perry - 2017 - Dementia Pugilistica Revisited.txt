Abstract. Extensive exposure of boxers to neurotrauma in the early 20th century led to the so-called punch drunk syndrome,
which was formally recognized in the medical literature in 1928. “Punch drunk” terminology was replaced by the less derisive
‘dementia pugilistica’ in 1937. In the early case material, the diagnosis of dementia pugilistica required neurological deficits,
including slurring dysarthria, ataxia, pyramidal signs, extrapyramidal signs, memory impairment, and personality changes,
although the specific clinical substrate has assumed lesser importance in recent years with a shift in focus on molecular
pathogenesis. The postmortem neuropathology of dementia pugilistica has also evolved substantially over the past 90 years,
from suspected concussion-related hemorrhages to diverse structural and neurofibrillary changes to geographic tauopathy.
Progressive neurodegenerative tauopathy is among the prevailing theories for disease pathogenesis currently, although this
may be overly simplistic. Careful examination of historical cases reveals both misdiagnoses and a likelihood that dementia
pugilistica at that time was caused by cumulative structural brain injury. More recent neuropathological studies indicate
subclinical and possibly static tauopathy in some athletes and non-athletes. Indeed, it is unclear from the literature whether
retired boxers reach the inflection point that tends toward progressive neurodegeneration in the manner of Alzheimer’s disease
due to boxing. Even among historical cases with extreme levels of exposure, progressive disease was exceptional.

INTRODUCTION
Given the necessity for self-defense in essentially
all animal species, it is not hard to imagine the
clenched fist appearing in human evolution along-
side the act of running, or that pugilism is likely
as old as humankind itself. Egyptian hieroglyphics
dating from 4000 BC suggest the existence of boxing-
like combat as a military expediency, with thongs
wrapped around hands as a precursor to the boxing
glove [1]. Similar leather-wrapped fists were noted in
ancient Baghdad. Boxing as a part of various games

and festivals was evident in early Greek and Roman
cultures [1]. The term boxing is believed to have its
origin in the clenched fist, or the folding of fingers
and thumb into a box-like structure, its roots from the
Greek and Latin being puxos and buxus, respectively.
Implements such as the cestus, a form of lethal gaunt-
let, were used in Ancient Rome for contests among
gladiators on feasts and holidays, but were eventually
banned in favor of the common sense view that fights
to the death, or near death, was not necessarily advan-
tageous for warrior training [1]. Without the prospect
of someone being killed, public interest in boxing
declined in the later years of the Roman Empire.
Emperor Theodosius the Great banned the Olympic
games and therefore its boxing component in 393
AD [1]. The subsequent 1300 years saw a relative

historical silence to boxing as a spectacle with greater
emphasis on warfare and weaponry, but resurfaced in
England, the “cradle of pugilism,” [1] coinciding with
expansion of the proletariat of the industrial revolu-
tion. Ritualistic armed contests such as fencing that
developed in the middle ages drifted into sport for the
aristocracy, while boxing was something of an equal-
izer for the new labor class, and a diversion from the
squalor of urban confinement.
By the late 19th and early 20th century, boxing
gloves and rules of engagement (e.g., Queensberry
Rules of 1867) had been broadly implemented,
allowing more of a sporting quality compared to
underground bare knuckle contests, and formal pro-
motion of “prize fighting.” Its popularity was such
that quality professional boxers could occasionally
subsist solely on contest proceeds, while many oth-
ers could earn a worthwhile supplement to a laborer’s
wage [2]. This is perhaps among the many factors
that led to increased exposure and increased num-
bers of those exposed in recent times. At any other
time in recorded history, boxing appears to have been
either compulsory or provided an unenviable sum to
that which could be derived from the low wage labor
market or the informal street economy. The increased
popularity also meant that lower tier and undertrained
boxers would continue fighting while their skills were
in decline, and at times offer themselves up for a
small stipend in professional contests, knowing full
well that severe physical punishment was the likely
outcome[2].Moreover,whennotparticipatinginpro-
moted fights, many boxers fought in carnival booths,
as often as 30 to 40 times a day [3], in an unmoni-
tored fashion, “taking on all comers.” Others sparred
with upper tier and more punishing fighters as a sepa-
rate endeavor, or in addition to promoted contests and
booth exhibitions [2]. The long term effects of these
ancillary activities, potentially synergistic with pro-
moted contests, was obliquely addressed by Roberts
[2], but are largely unknown to this day and likely
lost to history. The plight of such rank and file boxer
is summed up well by Critchley [4]:
“Of special aetiological importance is that hum-
bler side of boxing where the contestant travels in
fairs in the boxing booth (or “blood-tub”), taking
on all-comers at any weight. Almost as character-
istic is the story of the boxer who eventually gives
up the ring, having failed to make the grade, later
to become what they call a “punch-bag”- that is,
one of a team of sparring partners to a first-class
heavyweight. A typical story is that the boxer,
after a promising early career in the ring, begins
to slow up; to be knocked out more often; to win
fewer contests; and to be seedy for increasingly
longer periods after each affray. Most character-
istic of all is the admission on the part of the boxer
that he finally abandoned the ring because of his
wife’s increasing disapproval of his career.”
High levels of neurotrauma exposure from box-
ing in the early 20th century is apparent in the early
case material with professional fights numbering as
many as 1,000 and after a lengthy amateur career
[5]. Such high numbers are not encountered today.
According to one literature review, the average box-
ing career since the 1930 s has declined from 19 years
to 5 years, and the number of fights has declined
from an average of 336 to 13 [6]. The popularity
of the sport at that time was such that skilled fight-
ers would have bouts arranged and promoted almost
every week, compared to once a month or less by the
1950 s [2]. Oversight of the contests also differed.
Prior to World War II, there was no inclination on the
part of either the referee or the competitors to stop
the fight when one of the fighters was obtunded [2].
Repetitive concussive blows leveled on an incapaci-
tated fighter “out on his feet,” until he lay prostrate on
the canvass, occurred as a matter of routine [4]. The
presence of a physician was variably required among
the state boxing commissions, mainly for purposes
of emergency care [2]. It was not until 1979 that the
New York State Athletic Commission specified that
an assigned physician could step into the ring and stop
a bout [7]. Exceptionally long contests with numer-
ous two minute rounds were commonplace before
1940, and little care was taken in fight promotions to
match evenly skilled or evenly weighted boxers [2].
Lighterboxinggloves(6oz.)werecommon[5].Thus,
severe and protracting beatings, and numerous such
beatings with no mandatory exclusion times, were
typical over a boxer’s professional career, notwith-
standing any additive effects of one’s career as an
amateur, a sparring partner, or a booth fighter. It
is perhaps not surprising, in light of the dynamics
of boxing participation and boxing oversight, that a
neurological condition known colloquially as ‘punch
drunk’ emerged in the early 20th century and has
since tapered.
The focus on neurological injury from boxing
exposure tends to place emphasis on poor outcome,
although it should be pointed out for balance that tran-
scendent human benefits are still commented upon in
the modern era, such as self-esteem, respect within

the community, physical fitness, and avoidance of
a criminal lifestyle, alcohol, and illicit drugs [8].
Boxers themselves have rejected, sometimes bitterly,
the notion that boxing first and foremost encourages
violence [8]. Nevertheless, heated debate among box-
ing advocates versus those favoring a ban on the
sport have been taking place for many years and
are ongoing [9]. For the purposes of this review, we
do not presume to provide insight into the question
of whether ordered society has the moral impera-
tive to ban individuals from a sport like boxing, or
whether the benefits of boxing outweigh the risks. We
are more concerned with the nature of neurological
and biological processes associated with the “model
experiment” [10] of boxing, and the analysis of the
largely historical entity of dementia pugilistica with
the benefit of hindsight.
PUNCH DRUNK
Punch drunk appeared in the medical literature for
the first time in 1928, when Martland commented
on a ‘pecular condition’ among prize fighters [11].
The condition, plainly visible to boxing fans, promot-
ers, and indeed the fighters themselves in advance
of Martland’s paper, had not been codified previ-
ously as a neurological disease state. It was said to
affect lower skilled fighters of the “slugger” type who
tended to take considerable punishment while sizing
up their opponent for the elusive knockout blow, or
who were otherwise limited in defensive skills but
possessed the constitution to withstand substantial
physical punishment. Parker would later comment
that “Quick, agile, clever boxers who guard them-
selves well and take little punishment seem to escape.
Chiefly affected are the less expert but courageous
menwhotakeconsiderableinjuryinthehopeofwear-
ing out their opponents” [12]. Critchley drew similar
conclusions regarding the style of boxing, and also
suggested that the condition was much less common
in African American boxers [4], although he did not
provide any statistical basis for this latter conclusion.
Twenty-three fighters with the putative punch
drunkconditionwerereportedtoMartlandfromasin-
gle, well known, boxing promoter. 15 of these were
described simply as punch drunk, four were said to be
committed to an asylum and not otherwise character-
ized, three dragged an extremity (two of these were
also dysarthric, one was in ‘bad shape’), and one had
a parkinsonian syndrome. Martland examined five of
these subjects, although he provided no description
of any of the five. Instead, he described an additional
subjectascase2inhisreport–a38-year-oldmanwho
became symptomatic at age 23 with a left hand tremor
and unsteadiness in his legs, after 7 years of fight-
ing. Martland frankly acknowledged the differential
diagnosis of early-onset Parkinson disease (paraly-
sis agitans) in this subject, although he eliminated
epidemic encephalitis from the time course of clini-
cal symptoms. (case 1 in Martland’s paper consisted
of the autopsy findings in a 76-year-old man who
succumbed after falling down a flight of stairs; this
subject had no boxing history and was presented only
to illustrate Martland’s original hypothesis that punc-
tate hemorrhages were responsible for the clinical
signs of the punch drunk syndrome).
In keeping with present day discussions of
chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the relationship
between clinical findings, which themselves were
wide-ranging, and neuropathology, was speculative.
Martland described flopping of the foot or leg,
unsteadiness in gate, uncertainty in equilibrium (even
while actively boxing), appearance of intoxication,
peculiar tilting of the head, dragging of one or both
legs, a staggering or propulsive gait, parkinsonian
faces, tremors, vertigo, deafness, and in some cases
marked mental deterioration. The pathological sub-
strate offered by Martland appeared more in line with
acute parenchymal brain injury. His depiction of the
stairway-related fall is that of diffuse axonal injury,
with acute gliding contusions, hemorrhages in the
corpus callosum, and small hemorrhages in the basal
ganglia. Martland offered the theory that “Punch
drunk bares the same relation to multiple concus-
sion hemorrhages as do many of the post-concussion
neuroses and psychoses that follow blows or falls
on the head.” There was no mention of neurofibril-
lary tangles (NFT) or Alzheimer-related changes, or
otherwise a lesion that would correspond to accu-
mulations of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) or chronic
traumatic encephalopathy as it has been recently
described [13]. The potential for a manufactured con-
dition was not lost on Martland in his index report,
noting:
“While the establishment of these facts is of
enormous importance to the courts and to labor
compensation boards in placing many cases of
cranial injuries on a firm pathologic basis, it
also will have its disadvantages. A very great
field is opened for the so-called expert testi-
mony, in which malingerers and those suffering
from various forms of psychoses and neuroses
 1212
R.J. Castellani and G. Perry / Dementia Pugilistica Revisited
may claim undue compensation. The correct
diagnosis during life will always be extremely
difficult, as the condition can only be proved by
autopsy” [11].
The latter concept of autopsy-proven disease has
its own element of subjectivity. Martland’s “proof”
at the time consisted of concussion-related hemor-
rhages, which were never seriously considered as a
lesion responsible for long term sequelae after the
1940 s.
Millspaugh introduced the term “dementia pugilis-
tica” in 1937 [14] in a somewhat meandering
discussion, commenting on Martland’s findings and
the possibility for microscopic ring hemorrhages.
Observations by Parker, including his assertion of a
multitude of individual lesions [12], and by Jokl and
Gutterman [15] favoring a cerebral trauma-induced
dementia, were noted. Some attention to the prob-
lems of weight differences among fighters, and rules
requiring the attendance of medical officers, indi-
cated a level of concern for serious or permanent
injury at the time. Dyslalia of heterogeneous ori-
gin (laryngeal trauma, facial and dentition trauma,
psychiceffects),othematoma,andtraumaticmetacar-
pophalangeal arthropathies, were mentioned briefly.
Psychiatric disturbances, including quasi-delusional
ideation with “magnification of former prowess”
was commented upon, as were gait abnormali-
ties and Parkinsonian symptoms. Overall, dementia
pugilistica was meant to convey a physical-psychic
syndrome that accumulated over a lengthy boxing
career, but was less derisive and less resented among
boxers than ‘punch drunk’.
Despite the newly introduced term encompass-
ing ‘dementia’, Millspaugh tended to convey a static
condition, in that steady neurological deterioration
was less striking than the odd psychic characteris-
tics, neurological signs, and speech difficulties. The
morbid anatomy and associated mechanism were
addressed with some specificity. Particular vulnera-
bility of the “corpora striata, corona radiata, and the
basal ganglions” was suggested. Mechanistic theory
included “Traumatic punctate cerebral hemorrhages,
hydrostatic disequilibrium of the spinal fluid, cere-
bral edema, concussion injury to the cortical cells,
cerebral vasomotor imbalance, reparative gliosis or
degenerative lesions of cerebral parenchyma, vari-
ation in the weight and therefore inertia between
gray and white matter and tension transmission by
nerves, blood vessels and musculature,” which tend
to suggest cumulative damage from acute injury
mechanisms, as opposed to a progressive Alzheimer-
like neurodegeneration.
THE NATURE OF DISEASE
PROGRESSION
Modern experimental constructs implicating pro-
tein templating as an underlying mechanism [16]
require a priori the conclusion that progressive neu-
rodegeneration is caused by repetitive neurotrauma.
A close examination of the earliest case material in
dementia pugilistica, i.e., those with the most exten-
sive exposure to repetitive neurotrauma, nevertheless
indicate heterogeneity with regard to progressive
disease, and that a trauma-induced, progressive pro-
teinopathymodelisoverlysimplistic.Martlandstated
unambiguously that “Many cases remain mild in
nature and do not progress beyond that point” [11].
Parker similarly noted that “a pugilist may be only
mildly affected, and may continue to fight to the end
of his career, or he may be so disabled that he ulti-
mately has to quit boxing and yet gets no worse in
after life” [12]. On the other hand, a “progressive
neurological syndrome may appear, putting an end to
all fighting, and leading finally to mental or physi-
cal helplessness” was also suggested in some cases.
Critchley also raised the issue of a “groggy state,”
[4] or a form of preclinical dementia pugilistica, in
which the boxer’s skills may have subtly declined,
rendering him increasingly vulnerable to concussive
blows to the head, from which recovery is prolonged
and more likely incomplete. In this respect, an expo-
nential, rather than linear, increase in traumatic brain
damage during this era late in a boxing career may be
hypothesized, emphasizing the importance of retire-
ment once a critical point is reached (i.e., once the
boxer “softens up”) [17, 18], particularly if cumula-
tive structural injury underlies clinical progression.
Three case studies by Parker indicated injuries
traceable to specific fights, and a static or improved
course over time [12]. In Parker’s case 1, the boxer
“attributed all his difficulties to his last and futile
appearance in the ring. The unbroken chain of cause
and effect is very evident in this case, and it is to
be noted that in nearly two years the condition had
not become worse nor was there much improve-
ment beyond a certain point.” He went on to say
that “No specific nervous syndrome appeared, such
as Parkinson’s disease, but rather a medley of scat-
tered and incomplete lesions of the brain.” Parker’s
case 2 showed a number of neurological signs and
 R.J. Castellani and G. Perry / Dementia Pugilistica Revisited

deficient memory but that did not deteriorate over the
6 years prior to the report and, if anything, improved.
Parker’s case 3 showed progressive symptoms “up to
his final, ignominious failure in the ring, and then, for
eleven years thereafter, his condition remained much
the same as it was when he ceased fighting,” despite
an earlier clinical diagnosis of lateral sclerosis.
Critchley on the other hand suggested the term
chronic traumatic encephalopathy in 1949 [19] and
then “chronic progressive traumatic encephalopa-
thy of boxers” in 1957 [4], suggesting that lack of
insight into the neurological deficits was evidence
of an insidious onset, often culminating in a fatu-
ous or euphoric dementia with emotional lability.
Speech and thought became progressively slower in
his experience, with mood swings, truculence, and
uninhibited violent behavior. To support his views,
Critchley detailed 10 cases of punchdrunkenness,
although the individual case histories fit into the neu-
rological and psychiatric spectrum of other described
cases. He nevertheless favored a progressive process
once initiated:
“Of great interest, pathological as well as practi-
cal, is the fact that this traumatic encephalopathy
is a progressive condition. Once established it not
only does not permit of reversibility, but it ordi-
narily advances steadily. This is the case even
though the boxer has retired from the ring and
repeated cranial traumata are at an end” [4].
Mawdsley and Ferguson described a series of
10 subjects with air encephalography, document-
ing abnormalities in the septum pellucidum and
dilated lateral ventricles [20]. The case histories
likewise showed a mixture of neurological signs
with gait and speech abnormalities, pyramidal and
extra-pyramidal signs, memory loss, and brain atro-
phy. Slow progression of dysarthria, disorder of
movement, and memory deficits, were noted, and
it was stated that 8 out of 10 subjects had a
significant disability. Many were “unemployed for
many years,” while the authors also commented
that “Cerebrovascular lesions in ex-boxers of middle
age could possibly aggravate pre-existing traumatic
damage.”
Without insight into prevalence of the presumed
head-trauma induced condition, discussions of dis-
ease progression prior to the late 1960 s may have
been premature. Indeed, misinterpretation of single
cases, or failure to exclude coincidental neurological
illness, could mean the difference between conclud-
ing progressive disease versus a stationary condition.
To address this issue, the Royal College of Physi-
cians of London set up a committee ‘to report on
the medical aspects of boxing’, and appointed Dr. A.
H. Roberts to carry out a large scale cross-sectional
study, and the only study of its kind to date on
long term effects of neurotrauma in humans [2].
This was accomplished by examining a random sam-
ple 250 boxers out of 16,781 total boxers registered
by the British Boxing Board of Control between
1929 and 1955. Of those 250, 16 died, 9 emigrated,
and one refused to cooperate. 224 were thus stud-
ied by a series of four neuropsychological tests,
patient interview, clinical examination, and elec-
troencephalography. The results of the studies were
published in a book, ‘Brain Damage in Boxers’ in
1969. The remarkable yield of cooperation was only
possible through the diligent and time-consuming
house-to-house inquiries by social workers, many
times with the help of boxers themselves, in order
to facilitate dialogue. When one considers the dili-
gence of the effort as well as the era of numerous
boxers with extensive neurotrauma exposure, it is not
surprising that this now 50-year-old study has never
been replicated.
Roberts found that of the 224 boxers studied,
37 (17%) “had evidence of lesions of their cen-
tral nervous systems, similar to those reported and
attributed to boxing by others, and not typical of the
clinical entities encountered in routine neurological
practice.” Of these, 13 (6%) were more severely dis-
abledandappearedtopresenttwoclinicalsyndromes:
“one predominantly extra-pyramidal and apparently
more clearly progressive”, and the other predomi-
nantly cerebellar. (Extra-pyramidal signs attributable
to boxing have since been said to be exceedingly rare
[5, 21].) The more severe nature of the thirteen cases
was evident in their presentation to neurological clin-
ics. According to Roberts, these 6% were of the kind
labeled ‘punch drunk’ in boxing circles. The same
could not be said of the other 24 cases, as these indi-
viduals “were on the whole only marginally or in
no way disabled.” Interestingly, all of the 13 cases
with more severe clinical signs recognized as punch
drunk boxed prior to World War II. Roberts com-
mented on the issue of disease progression at some
length despite the cross sectional design, as the idea
of a neurodegenerative disease provoked by repetitive
head trauma was already being raised. He noted that
the “first evidence of the condition may follow one
or a series of particularly hard fights, and that it may
then regress if the boxer stops fighting.” This same
phenomenon appears in a number of other described
 1214
R.J. Castellani and G. Perry / Dementia Pugilistica Revisited
cases [3], rather than after a period of latency. Roberts
goes on to state:
“When there is an adequate independent account,
or the individual has sufficient insight, most of
these boxers appear to have developed the symp-
toms of the condition during their last years
boxing or after a series of particularly hard fights.
It seems that some degree of progression may
occur which cannot be accounted for simply on
the basis of normal ageing, and occurs more com-
monly in the extra-pyramidal lesions, but apart
from a few isolated exceptions reported previ-
ously and in one case in the present series (case
2), this progression is not in general characteris-
tic of that seen in the systems degenerations or in
the commoner presenile dementias” [2].
The appearance of traumatic encephalopathy from
midbrain injury after a single bout supports Roberts’
assertions [17, 22, 23]. Roberts also identified
asymmetrical motor signs, including tremor and
hyperreflexia, with an overall tendency to favor the
boxer’s left side [2]. Given the predominance of
right-handed boxers, it has been asserted that such
asymmetry is due to structural injury per se to the
upper brainstem, from mechanical trauma per se.
Case 2 in the selected case summaries provided
by Roberts, on the other hand, suggests a progres-
sive neurological disease. Roberts commented that
the condition dated from the subject’s active boxing
career(asopposedtofollowingaperiodof“latency”),
and expressed some difficulty in excluding a co-
existing neurodegenerative disease, especially given
the rarity of this type of clinical progression in the
series. In the final analysis, Roberts’ described uncer-
taintyonissueofprogressionversustheagingprocess
superimposedonstaticdeficits,apossibilityendorsed
by Jordan [24]:
“How far it can be assumed that a progressive
degenerative process involving the neuron is mir-
rored in the widespread neurofibrillary changes
found in some ex-boxers’ brains remains unan-
swered. It seems certain that diffuse cellular
and axonal depletion has resulted from box-
ing to account for the clinical syndrome related
to occupational exposure found in the present
study. It must therefore be assumed that cerebral
trauma of a minor degree may result in perma-
nent structural damage that is cumulative. There
was good evidence in some cases that the condi-
tion had progressed for some time after retirement
from boxing, particularly in those with evidence
of extra-pyramidal lesions, but the information
available from the study proved inadequate to set-
tle finally the question of progression unrelated to
the changes associated with ageing” [2].
In short, cases with progressive disease were
the exception in Roberts’ series, and still lacked
Alzheimer-like progression in the rare patients with
extrapyramidal signs. At one point, Roberts com-
mented that “There is a good deal of evidence in
the present study to suggest that in most cases the
condition remains stationary when the individual
has stopped boxing, and indeed there are excel-
lent independent accounts for a few of undoubted
improvement after their retirement.” The contrast
between Roberts’ case synthesis and classical neu-
rodegenerative diseases is noteworthy, as the latter
never remain stationary let alone improve. Only
two subjects in Roberts’ series were indisputably
demented judging by their inability to live unaided
in the community [2]. The protein cascades cur-
rently under discussion seem, therefore, to over-run
the empirical observation that a progressive neu-
rodegenerative disease, in a manner of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), is exceptional at best, even in these
early 20th century boxers whose exposure levels
were extreme. It finally should be noted that none
of the Roberts’ cases were accompanied by patho-
logical confirmation. The difficulty in obtaining such
cases at autopsy, then and now, speaks to the lack
of a cohesive neurodegenerative disease entity, and
keeps viable the possibility or probability that some
cases in this largest series of boxers consisted of
idiopathic progressive synucleinopathies or other
sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrovascu-
lar disease, and/or an undiagnosed infectious or
inflammatory processes.
NEUROPATHOLOGY DESCRIBED IN
BOXERS
Historically,
neurodegenerative
diseases
were
uncovered by the appearance of an unusual and inex-
orably progressive neurological decline, followed
by neuropathological examination at autopsy. The
index case of AD, for example, occurred in a middle
aged woman with relentless neurologic deteriora-
tion and autopsy demonstration of hallmark lesions
[25]. In contrast, Martland’s original description [11],
Millspaugh’s article introducing the term “dementia
 R.J. Castellani and G. Perry / Dementia Pugilistica Revisited
1215
pugilistica,” [14] Roberts’ case series [2], and many
other early reports describing encephalopathy in
boxers [3], were unaccompanied by autopsy neu-
ropathology.
It is further emblematic of the complexity of the
topic that the first report of boxers’ encephalopathy
at autopsy was not a case of dementia pugilistica
or punch drunk syndrome, at all. In 1954, Bran-
denburg and Hallervorden described the autopsy
findings in a 51-year-old man who had boxed from
age 18 to 29, ultimately holding the title of ama-
teur German middle-weight champion for 6 years
[26]. At age 39, personality changes appeared, which
deteriorated into insomnia, memory loss, dysphasia,
parkinsonism, and frank dementia. The most remark-
able finding at autopsy was extensive AD pathology,
including an abundance of senile plaques of var-
ious morphological types, severe cerebral amyloid
angiopathy, and numerous NFT. Noteworthy as well
were numerous so-called “condensation plaques”
which correspond to today’s “cotton wool” plaque.
The findings thus indicate rather unambiguously the
presence of early-onset AD. The abundance of cotton
wool plaques also suggests familial disease associ-
ated with presenilin-1 mutation [27]. Unfortunately,
no family history was available or otherwise provided
in this case.
The case reported by Grahmann and Ule in 1957
[28] is often considered alongside the case report by
Brandenburg and Hallervorden as among the first
cases suggesting a “link” between neurofibrillary
change and boxing. In this case, the findings in a
46-year-old man who boxed between the ages of
15 and 25 were described. He expired after suffer-
ing hemorrhagic venous infarction from a cerebral
venous sinus thrombosis, and after a documented,
progressive neurological decline starting at age 36.
The case history is similar to the earlier report by
Brandenburg and Hallervorden in its description of
progressive neurological deterioration, which clearly
suggests neurodegenerative disease. It differs, how-
ever, in the absence of senile plaques and cerebral
amyloid angiopathy, and with neurofibrillary changes
noted largely in the brainstem and medial tempo-
ral lobe. Cerebral atrophy was present, along with
cavum septum pellucidum, as was loss of Purkinje
cells and granular neurons of the cerebellum. Since
limited pathological illustrations were made avail-
able, it is unclear how carefully sporadic systems
degenerations were excluded. From the standpoint
of Roberts’ epidemiological survey, this case would
have represented an outlier, both in terms of the long
symptom-free interval between boxing and onset of
symptoms, and the inexorable disease progression.
The possibility of coincidental neurodegenerative
disease unrelated to boxing remains a consideration.
To his credit, Roberts recognized the possibility of
coincidental neurological disease in the above two
cases, noting:
“it would appear that the kind of progression
indistinguishablefromAlzheimer’sdiseaseintwo
of the fourteen neuropathological studies of box-
ers reported so far must be extremely uncommon.
So much so, that the fortuitous occurrence in
Boxers of Alzheimer’s disease in these two cases
cannot be entirely ignored” [2].
Neubuerger et al. reported two cases in 1959 [29].
His first case presented at age 46 initially for a coro-
nary complaint, and four years later with a complaint
of headaches. Neurological examination revealed a
head and neck tremor, increased tone in the right
arm, defective upward gaze, a mildly abnormal EEG,
and abnormalities on neurocognitive testing. Neu-
ropathology was limited to a brain biopsy, performed
for unstated reasons, which showed gliosis. His sec-
ond patient presented at age 53 with neurological
decline including dementia and ataxia, eventually
expiring secondary to pulmonary fibrosis and cor pul-
monale. He had boxed between the ages of 18 and 24.
Autopsy examination showed significant frontal cor-
tical atrophy but no neurofibrillary degeneration or
senile plaques. This case thus lacks all pathological
features attributed to boxing, while frontotemporal
dementia would be a consideration if not likely.
Courville (1962) published what he considered a
verified case of dementia pugilistica in a 49-year-
old man with alcoholism and diabetes mellitus, and
a four-year boxing history [30]. Autopsy, however,
showed nonspecific thickening of the leptomeninges
and nonspecific changes on microscopy. Spillane
(1962)reportedautopsyfindingsina45-year-oldman
with approximately 300 professional fights, among a
total of five cases with heterogeneous clinical pre-
sentations [31]. Neurological signs included slurred
speech beginning about the time he retired from
boxing at age 32. Later neurological signs included
dragging of the left lower extremity and left arm
posturing, ataxia, and continued dysarthria. Autopsy
was performed after he suffered an acute myocardial
infarct. Areas of “softening” in multiple brain regions
were noted, suggestive of cerebrovascular disease.
Spillane made no mention of neurofibrillary degener-
ation and ultimately concluded that “Taken together,
 1216
R.J. Castellani and G. Perry / Dementia Pugilistica Revisited
these cases illustrate the difficulties of aetiological
diagnosis and emphasize the extent of our ignorance
of this subject.”
Case 10 by Mawdsley and Ferguson (1963)
depicted the autopsy findings in a 51-year-old ex-
boxer who retired at age 35 with 300 professional
fights [20]. He was said to be “punchy” with slurred
speech, an expressionless face, memory loss, apathy,
and brisk reflexes, expiring secondary to squamous
cell carcinoma of the floor of mouth. Autopsy showed
gross atrophy, cavum septum pellucidum, and sep-
tal fenestration. No microscopic examination was
provided. Payne (1968) reported neuropathological
findings in six professional boxers with extensive
boxing histories in addition to significant vascular,
psychiatric, and alcohol abuse co-morbidities [32].
In particular, he noted septal abnormalities, minis-
cars in the cerebral cortex, and foci of white matter
degeneration.Senileplaquesandearlyneurofibrillary
changes were noted in two cases, which Payne con-
cluded were “nonspecific degenerative phenomena.”
Burger and Minarovjech (1966) reported nonspecific
neuropathology in a 44-year-old former boxer who
expired from intracerebral hemorrhage [33]. Betti
and Ottino (1969) reported brain biopsy findings in
a 38-year-old former boxer with an extensive boxing
exposure as well as head trauma from a stairway-
relatedfall[34].Asymmetricaltremor,abnormalgait,
and dysarthria were noted clinically. Brain biopsy,
performed for unclear reasons, showed nonspecific
loss of neurons.
The landmark study of chronic neuropathology
in former boxers was published by Corsellis et al.
in 1973 [35] and established the neuropathology of
dementia pugilistica until about 1990. This was a
retrospective analysis of 15 cases examined in the
Department of Neuropathology at the Runwell Hos-
pital Institute of Psychiatry, near London, UK. Since
the limiting factor for case acquisition in the Corsellis
series was examination at the Institute of Psychiatry,
selection bias precludes any discussion of prevalence.
The spectrum of pathology is nonetheless noteworthy
and perhaps not fully appreciated in modern dis-
cussions of long-term effects of mild neurotrauma.
Subjects in the Corsellis series boxed between 1900
and 1940, with ages at death ranging from 57 to
91. As noted above, boxers in this era had exten-
sive neurotrauma exposure, vastly exceeding levels
of exposure encountered today. Many of the subjects
participated in hundreds of promoted fights. Some
fought in booths. 7 of the 15 endorsed a history of
heavy alcohol use, whereas heightened sensitivity to
the effects of alcohol was reported in 6 cases. In only
four cases was alcohol use specifically denied. The
duration of neurological signs potentially attributed
to boxing was often unclear, but ranged from 8 years
to 41 years in cases providing such data. The pre-
cise onset of symptoms relative to boxing was often
unclear.
Neuropathological examination emphasized neu-
rofibrillary degeneration on von Braunmuhl silver
impregnation, especially in the substantia nigra and
medial temporal lobe. These were often present in
large numbers in the face of limited plaque pathol-
ogy, thus separating the neurofibrillary degeneration
of dementia pugilistica from that of typical AD. Sub-
stantia nigra neuron loss, cerebellar scarring (with
extensive measurements and neuronal counts) par-
ticularly involving the cerebellar tonsils, and septal
abnormalities with an enlarged cavum and septal fen-
estrations were also considered among the cardinal
manifestations of boxing-relating neuropathology.
There was significant heterogeneity in the sample,
however. Although not specifically highlighted as
boxing-specific, atrophic or flattened fornices were
present in several cases. Shrunken and atrophic mam-
millary bodies were also noted in about half of the
cases. Hippocampal atrophy was present in some
cases, and hippocampal sclerosis per se was depicted
in case 1. Cerebrovascular disease with infarcts was
present in several cases. Given the important role
of cerebrovascular disease in producing focal neu-
rological signs as well as cognitive deficits [36],
and the relative lack of effective anti-hypertensive
therapy in the early 20th century, the role of co-
morbid cerebrovascular disease among classic cases
of boxers’ encephalopathy may be underappreciated.
Structural traumatic brain injury was also evident,
with remote contusions and hemosiderin staining of
the olfactory bulbs in some cases. A cavernous mal-
formation was present in one case. Tabes dorsalis
was present in still another case. Three cases showed
no specific pathology, and one was reported to lack
a boxing history on further analysis [37]. All told,
the Corsellis series is a complex and heterogeneous
sample with numerous co-morbidities and struc-
tural injuries involving a multitude of brain regions.
Despite the heterogeneity of neuropathology in the
Corsellis et al. sample, however, the major impact
seems to have been the renewal of focus on neurode-
generative pathology and in particular neurofibrillary
degeneration.
 R.J. Castellani and G. Perry / Dementia Pugilistica Revisited
1217
Asanindicatoroftherarityofdementiapugilistica,
studies in the 1980 s and early 1990 s often looked
to the Corsellis series for application of lately avail-
able immunohistochemistry, and offered examination
of only a small number of new cases. For example,
Roberts [38] in 1988 examined 8 of 15 cases from
the Corsellis series with anti-sera to p-tau with no
additional cases. Roberts et al. [39] in 1990 exam-
ined 14 of 15 Corsellis et al. cases with anti-sera to
amyloid-� (A�) (in addition to 5 amateur boxer cases
that lacked features of classical dementia pugilis-
tica). The 1988 study confirmed the linkage of p-tau
to neurofibrillary degeneration in dementia pugilis-
tica, with cases resembling AD, while the 1990 study
highlighted variably extensive A�-positive diffuse
plaques not previously noted with silver impregna-
tion techniques, raising the issue of diffuse plaque
pathology as a component of repetitive trauma-
induced changes. Tokuda et al. [40] re-examined 7
cases from the Corsellis et al. series, and added one
new case, noting extensive morphologically diverse
plaque pathology with significant overlap with AD.
This suggested to Tokuda et al. a role of trauma in
AD pathogenesis, but on balance also suggests co-
morbid aging and/or AD pathology in the original
Corsellis case series. Allsop et al. [41] re-examined
6 cases from the original Corsellis series and 2 new
cases, also noting more abundant A� pathology than
previously appreciated from silver impregnation, in
addition to A� immunoreactive NFT with advanced
pathology.
Hof et al. [42] extended the specificity of neu-
rofibrillary degeneration in dementia pugilistica by
examining three boxers with extensive boxing expo-
sure. In this study, findings consistent with Corsellis
et al. were noted, including abundant neurofibrillary
pathology, cerebellar cortical pathology, substantia
nigra pathology, and septal pathology. However, the
authors noted larger numbers of NFT in superficial
cortical laminae, and thus provided an additional
point of distinction between trauma-related NFT
and aging/Alzheimer-related NFT. Geddes et al.
[43] examined the brain of a 23-year-old boxer
who suffered an acute boxing-related death. P-tau
immunohistochemistry, even in this young subject,
showed abundant cortical p-tau, predominantly in
frontal and temporal lobes. The immunoreactivity
was patchy and showed a predilection for perivascu-
lar areas. No clinical signs were ascribed to the p-tau
pathology although it was noted that the decedent was
“somewhat forgetful” during life.
EVOLUTION OF DEMENTIA
PUGILISTICA OVER TIME
The evolution of punch drunk/dementia pugilis-
tica since 1928 is noteworthy, particularly alongside
AD in which basic understanding of the clinical
substrate, cognitive trajectory, and the pathological
hallmarks has remained relatively stable since 1906.
As noted above, dementia pugilistica was identi-
fied initially because of purely neurological signs,
such as dysarthria, pyramidal and extra-pyramidal
signs, and ataxia. Concussion-related hemorrhages
were the initially-offered pathologic substrate [11].
Alzheimer-like pathology was then erroneously
linked to dementia pugilistica as noted above [26].
NFT as a component of dementia pugilistica was
reaffirmed by Corsellis et al. [35], who then added
septal abnormalities, cerebellar sclerosis, and dam-
age to the substantia nigra to the list of changes.
Patchy tauopathy with predilection for superficial
cortical laminae and perivascular areas of the cor-
tex and A�-positive diffuse plaques appeared in the
1990 s [42, 43], while the specificity of nigral and
cerebellar pathology seems to have been abandoned.
Additional patterns of tauopathy have been ascribed
to chronic effects of trauma in more recent studies
[44], and further refined to a single required crite-
rion with several supportive criteria according to a
consensus recommendation forged in 2015 [13]. It is
further stated that as many as 20% of cases with pre-
sumably sport-related p-tau deposits may be missed
by routine dementia sampling and immunostaining
protocols [13].
It is of note that among the few dementia pugilis-
tica cases reported in the recent literature, either no
clinical signs were apparent, or clinical signs were
attributabletoothermajordiseases[43,45–48].Thus,
as classical dementia pugilistica has receded over
the years, dementia pugilistica diagnosed purely by
p-tau immunohistochemistry, either in the absence of
neurological signs or in the context of other neuro-
logical diseases, have taken their place. This leaves
open the question of clinical significance of patchy p-
tau immunoreactivity, identified by highly sensitive
means.
Figure 1 depicts a case in point. This section was
obtained from the NIH Neurobiobank at the Univer-
sity of Maryland. In particular, it was obtained as a
control case for a brain bank dedicated to neurodevel-
opmental disorders. The decedent was a 51-year-old
man who died of suddenly of pneumonia complicated
 1218

by cardiovascular disease, prior to which he had no
health complaints whatsoever. He was neurologically
and psychologically healthy. He was on no medica-
tions. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. It
was gleaned from the death investigation, however,
that the decedent had competed as an professional
boxer during his youth. He fought in 14 profes-
sional contexts and lost 7 of them, two by knock out.
At autopsy, his brain was grossly and microscopi-
cally normal. Because of his boxing history, and only
because of his boxing history, extensive immunohis-
tochemical stains for p-tau (AT8) were performed,
and indeed there were accumulations of p-tau in neu-
rons and glia, at times in patchy foci at the depths
of cortical sulci, meeting modern criteria for chronic
traumatic encephalopathy. Given his limited boxing
exposure, it seems likely that a similar subclinical
stationary tauopathy may be encountered in other
asymptomatic athletes with similar or less exposure,
and for that matter in non-athletes. This would not
be particularly surprising given the ubiquity of more
stereotyped p-tau accumulation with age and in the
absence of clinical disease [49]. One could specu-
late about the decedent’s neurological or cognitive
trajectory had he lived, but the circularity of such
speculation, the lack of insight into the kinetics of
such changes over time, and the poor correlation
between uncomplicated p-tau reactivity (i.e., p-tau
reactivity without neuronal loss) and neurological
signs, are problematic.
THE ROLE OF TAU PATHOLOGY IN
DEMENTIA PUGILISTICA
As stated by Roberts:
“It has never been doubted, since it is implicit in
the contest, that personal injury occurs in boxing,
or that, rarely, accidents happen, as they do in
other sports, which result in damage to cerebral
functions and even death. Until recently it had
not been suggested that the evidently transient
incapacity usually sustained might result in per-
manent, slight but cumulative damage to delicate
neural structures.”
The heavy neurotrauma exposure of the early
20th century boxing thus brought into medical con-
sciousness the intuitively obvious conclusion that
brain damage could occur in some participants,
and that structural brain injury might be cumulative
with time and exposure. A progressive Alzheimer-
like neurodegenerative cascade from boxing-induced
neurofibrillary degeneration, however, was hypothet-
ical then as it is today. The modern concept of p-tau
as a driver of disease likewise sets aside cumula-
tive structural brain injury and instead opens up
hypothesis-confirming lines of inquiry, perhaps pre-
maturely, such as 1) tau biomarkers, such as in
cerebrospinal fluid or on PET imaging studies [50]; 2)
the role of low-n assembly intermediates of p-tau in
experimental trauma versus control [51]; 3) the role
of any of a number inflammatory mediators in tau
phosphorylation [52]; 4) similarities and differences
intauisoformprofilesinrepetitivetraumaversuscon-
ventional tauopathy [46]; and 5) templating behavior
and prion-like conformers and strains in experimen-
tal constructs, among others [53]. The question of
whether tau pathobiology is a primary or inherently
pathogenic process in the first place seems reasonable
to ask, given that p-tau is manifestly downstream in a
multitude of conditions [54–57], and that the over-
 R.J. Castellani and G. Perry / Dementia Pugilistica Revisited
1219
whelming majority of heavily exposed boxers are
asymptomatic, with most of the rest having stationary
neurological deficits.
The amyloid cascade hypothesis may provide
some guidance as one attempts to understand the rela-
tionship between proteinopathy and clinical disease
[58–60]. In terms of a hypothesis for disease etiol-
ogy or an otherwise rate-limiting factor for disease
pathogenesis [61], the role of A� in AD is consider-
ably more robust scientifically than p-tau in dementia
pugilistica. Pathogenic mutations in amyloid-� pro-
tein precursor (A�PP) within and near the A� coding
region lead to familial autosomal dominant AD with
near 100% penetrance. In Down syndrome patients,
who possess an extra copy and overproduce A�PP,
AD pathology as well as cognitive deterioration from
baseline, appear consistently and early compared to
sporadic AD and aging. Familial early-onset AD is
associated with mutations not only in A�PP, but
also in presenilin 1 and 2—components of the �-
secretase complex, required for processing of the
A�PP into A�. Thus in AD, not only is there
strict adherence to central dogma of molecular biol-
ogy and genotype-phenotype relationships, there is
alsogeneticadherencetogenotype-enzyme-substrate
phenotype relationships. In addition, animal models
in AD are well characterized and consistently reca-
pitulate hallmarks of AD pathology [62]. Therapeutic
constructs that reduce A� have been shown to reduce
behavioral and neurocognitive deficits in AD mod-
els [63]. These data have further been extended to
clinical trials in humans, in which immunotherapy
has been shown to reduce A� burden [64]. Yet in
the case of AD, despite its robust molecular-genetic
underpinningsanddetailedextenttowhichithasbeen
investigated in humans, all major therapeutic trials
targetingA�haveeithershownnobenefitorhaveper-
formed worse than placebo [60]. The point here is that
lesion- or protein-driven neurodegenerative disease
constructs insufficiently address the complexity of
neurodegenerativediseaseinhumans,eveninthecase
of AD, a much more homogeneous condition com-
pared to dementia pugilistica, studied in exhaustive
detail over three decades with all available techno-
logical advancements. By that analogy, the concept
of p-tau as a driver of disease or target for therapy in
dementia pugilistica seems premature.
CONCLUSIONS
Dementia pugilistica has evolved remarkably
over time. Concussion-related hemorrhages, AD
pathology, diverse neuropathology encompassing
structural brain lesions, neurofibrillary pathology and
diffuse A� plaques, and, most recently, geographic
tauopathy have all been proposed as patholog-
ical substrates. The classic clinical presentation
includes slurring dysarthia, pyramidal and extrapyra-
midal signs, ataxia, memory deficits, and personality
changes, although the diagnosis is occasionally
offered in more recent literature in asymptomatic
young athletes and in retired athletes with other
major diseases. Assuming that dementia pugilistica is
exposure-related, the prevalence of dementia pugilis-
tica or punch drunk syndrome appears to have peaked
at 6%, and it makes sense in light of the markedly
decreased exposure since World War II that classical
dementia pugilistica has reduced to a rarity, notwith-
standing subclinical and stationary p-tau deposits
in asymptomatic athletes. On the other hand, since
cumulative structural brain injury may have been
the driver of disease for dementia pugilistica when
it was most prevalent, and since single bouts have
been shown, on rare occasions, to produce perma-
nent deficits, boxing can never be said to be devoid
of risk for permanent brain injury or even death.
Of particular concern is not simply the existence
of structural brain injury, including cumulative struc-
tural brain injury, which obviously has occurred
in some boxers, but the specific concept of repet-
itive trauma-induced neurodegenerative disease in
the manner of AD, propagated by a proteinopathy.
Clinicopathological data in boxers with extreme neu-
rotrauma exposure leaves considerable doubt that
such a process exists today with any frequency,
while those anecdotal instances with evidence
of progression tend to be confounded either by
major co-morbidities, failure to exclude coincidental
neurodegeneration disease, or outdated pathomor-
phological analyses that are not amenable to
comparison with current concepts. Also striking is
the paucity of new cases of dementia pugilistica in the
literature, and in those few cases that have appeared,
the lack of the neurological syndrome (dysarthria,
ataxia, asymmetric hyperreflexia, etc.) that allowed
identification of punch drunk syndrome or dementia
pugilistica in the first place. At present, if one is rig-
orous with the human data, it remains unclear how,
and indeed whether, traumatic brain injury from box-
ing crosses the threshold from structural damage to a
progressive neurodegenerative cascade. On the other
hand, the finding of p-tau in atypical patterns and dis-
tributions, even in asymptomatic athletes, indicates
that more research is needed.
