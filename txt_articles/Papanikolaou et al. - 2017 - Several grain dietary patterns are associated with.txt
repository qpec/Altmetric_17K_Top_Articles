Abstract
Background: The present study identified the most commonly consumed grain food patterns in US children and
adolescents (2–18 years-old; N = 8,367) relative to those not consuming grains and compared diet quality and
nutrient intakes, with focus on 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2015–2020 DGA) shortfall nutrients.
Methods: Cluster analysis using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2010,
identified 8 unique grain food patterns: a) no consumption of main grain groups, b) cakes, cookies and pies, c)
yeast bread and rolls, d) cereals, e) pasta, cooked cereals and rice, f) crackers and salty snacks, g) pancakes, waffles
and French toast and other grains, and h) quick breads.
Results: Energy intake was higher for all grain cluster patterns examined, except ‘cereals’, compared to no grains.
Children and adolescents in the ‘yeast bread and rolls’, ‘cereals’, ‘pasta, cooked cereals and rice’, and ‘crackers and
salty snacks’ patterns had a higher diet quality relative to no grains (all p < 0.01). Energy adjusted (EA) dietary fiber
intake was greater in five of the seven grain patterns, ranging from 1.8 – 2.8 g more per day (all p < 0.01), as
compared to those consuming no grains. All grain patterns, except cakes, cookies and pies had higher EA daily
folate relative to children in the no grains pattern (all p < 0.0001). EA total fat was lower in ‘cereals’, ‘pasta, cooked
cereals and rice’, and ‘pancakes, waffles, French toast and other grains’ in comparison to the no grains food pattern
(all p < 0.01). EA magnesium intakes were greater in children and adolescents consuming ‘yeast bread and rolls’, ‘pasta,
cooked cereals and rice’, and ‘quick breads’, while EA iron was higher in all grain patterns relative to no grains (all p < 0.
01). EA vitamin D intake was higher only in children consuming ‘cereals’ vs. no grain group (p < 0.0001). There were no
significant differences in total or added sugar intake across all grain clusters as compared to no grains.
Conclusions: Consumption of several, but not all, grain food patterns in children and adolescents were associated
with improved 2015–2020 DGA shortfall nutrient intakes and diet quality as compared to those consuming no grains.

 Background
The
2015–2020
Dietary
Guidelines
for
Americans
(2015–2020 DGA) policy report states that several nutri-
ents are under-consumed relative to requirement levels
set by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). These have been
characterized as shortfall nutrients and include vitamin A,
vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin C, folate, calcium, magne-
sium, fiber, and potassium. For adolescent, premenopausal
females and women who are pregnant, iron is also deemed
an under-consumed nutrient of public health concern
largely due to increased risk of iron-deficiency in these
populations. Of the shortfall nutrients, calcium, vitamin
D, fiber, and potassium also are classified as nutrients of
public health concern because their under-consumption
has been linked in the scientific literature to adverse
health outcomes [1]. The report further identified that a
healthy dietary pattern is higher in fruits, vegetables,
whole grains, low- and non-fat dairy, seafood, legumes,
and nuts; and lower in red and processed meat, sugar-
sweetened
foods
and
beverages
and
refined
grains.
However, a variety of grain-based food products, of which
include refined/enriched grains, are sources for several
shortfall nutrients identified by the DGA, including diet-
ary fiber, folate, iron, and magnesium [1]. With mandatory
folic acid fortification commencing in 1998 by the Food
and Drug Administration [2], specific grain foods became
leading sources for folate; breads, rolls, and crackers are
the largest contributor of total folate to the US diet, con-
tributing nearly 16% of total intake, which exceeds contri-
bution of folate from vegetables [3]. Similarly, using data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES) 2003–2006, researchers have reported that
fortification
of
grain
foods
substantially
contributes
nutrient adequacy for U.S. children and adolescents aged
2–18
years-old,
without
excessive
intakes
for
most
vitamins and minerals [4].
While certain grain food products are contributors of nu-
trients to limit in the diet, including added sugar, total and
saturated fat [5, 6], grain foods also contribute positive
nutrients to the diet, including dietary fiber, iron, magne-
sium, and B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and folate).
Food sources of energy and nutrients data in children
showed that while three of the top ten ranking foods for cal-
orie contribution to the diet were grain-based foods, the top
ten ranking food sources of dietary fiber included six grain-
based products, collectively contributing 40% of total daily
dietary fiber intake [4]. Others have argued that while three
of the top ten sources of energy provided no nutritional
value, the remaining sources of energy, including milk, beef,
poultry, cheese and baked goods are significant contributors
of nutrients of concern and other essential nutrients, postu-
lating the premise that elimination of these foods from food
patterns could potential have inadvertent effects on diet
quality in the US population [6].
Recent NHANES data in adults showed that some, but
not all, grain food patterns were associated with better
nutrient intakes, improved diet quality and beneficial
obesity-related parameters [7]. While 2015–2020 DGA
identify
several
healthy
dietary
food
patterns,
and
encourage
increased
whole
grain
consumption
and
reduced refined grain intake, at present, there are no
data that evaluate the association of different grain food
patterns on nutrient intakes and diet quality outcomes
in children and adolescents. Further, some popular diet
plans encourage diet patterns that omit gluten- contain-
ing or grain-based foods (e.g. Paleolithic diet) as health-
ier patterns [8, 9]. As such, the objective of the current
analyses was to isolate the most commonly consumed grain
food patterns in U.S. children and adolescents and compare
nutrient intakes and diet quality of those consuming various
grain food patterns to those not consuming grain foods
using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examin-
ation Survey (NHANES) 2005–2010. The hypothesis for the
present analysis was that certain grain food patterns are as-
sociated with improved diet quality and can significantly
contribute nutrients, including shortfall nutrients, while
concurrently lowering nutrients to limit in the diet.
Methods
Data were obtained from What We Eat in America, the
dietary intake component of NHANES. NHANES is a
government-directed program led by the Center for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention in collaboration with US
Department of Agriculture. Written informed consent
was obtained for all participants or proxies, and the survey
protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review
Board at the National Center for Health Statistics. The
distribution of the civilian non-institutionalized US
population, as well as response rate percentages and
population totals in NHANES 2005–2010 data by age
and gender, can be viewed at www.cdc.gov/nchs/
nhanes/response_rates_cps.htm. Data from the current
NHANES are released every two years and for the current
analyses, we used three data releases, namely 2005–2006,
2007–2008, and 2009–2010 [10, 11].
The dietary intake data were obtained from an in-
person 24-hour dietary recall (Day 1) by trained
specialists using the Automated Multiple-Pass Method
[12] as a means to reduce bias in reporting energy and
nutrient intakes in the Mobile Examination Center.
The Multiple-Pass Method consisted of five steps: (1)
the quick list, which included an uninterrupted list of
foods and beverages consumed by the subject; (2) the
forgotten foods list, which queried the subject on
categories of foods that have been documented as fre-
quently forgotten; (3) a time and occasion where foods
were consumed; (4) the detail cycle, which elicited
descriptions of foods and amounts consumed with the

 aid of an interactive Food Model Booklet and measur-
ing guides; and (5) final probe review. USDA’s Food and
Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies, 3.0, 4.1, and 5.0
was used to code dietary intake data and calculate nutrient
intakes [13–15].
Cluster analysis was used to develop patterns of grain
consumption—a statistical procedure that analyses large
data sets to identify various patterns while trying to
maximize
differences
among
the
patterns.
Cluster
analysis allows for the focus on a specifically defined
aspect (i.e., grain food consumption) and then forces
maximal
differences
in
clusters
for
assessments.
Cluster analysis also allows for group comparisons
rather than factor analysis which are generally associ-
ations. The USDA food coding system was used to de-
fine categories of grain foods [15]. Grain foods intake
patterns were identified using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, 2013) PROC CLUSTER using a single 24-
hour dietary recall in NHANES 2005–2010. SUDAAN
v.11.0 (Research Triangle Institute; Raleigh, NC) was
used to adjust analyses for sampling weights and the
sampling units and strata information as provided by
NHANES. Clusters were developed based on the per-
centage of calories consumed from the grain products as
the centroid for each cluster. Grains from flour and dry
mixes, mixed dishes, and meat substitutes were not in-
cluded in development of grain clusters. Cluster analyses
provides the ability to focus on a particular defined as-
pect (e.g. calories from grains) and then forces maximal
differences in clusters for assessment. For these analyses,
the USDA grains products main categories were used to
identify the grain cluster patterns of intake (see Table 1).
All main grain food codes fit into one and only one of
the grain foods groupings. The patterns identified by the
cluster analysis were then identified by percent calories
within each grain food grouping (only groups that con-
tributed 5% or more of calories were used to define the
clusters) at the centroid of each cluster. Using this
method resulted in seven readily identifiable grain food
patterns and a no consumption of main grain groups
(i.e., no grains group); creating eight unique patterns of
grain food consumption. With grain food cluster pat-
terns identified, and using the output from the cluster
procedure, each subject was then placed in the cluster
that matched most closely to the pattern of calories
across the food categories.
Adjusted least-square means ± SE values for subjects
were determined in each cluster using PROC REGRESS
and LOGREGRESS in SUDAAN 11.0 for dietary intakes
and diet quality [Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010]
with various sets of covariates. Covariates for analyses of
energy intake, HEI-2010 and HEI sub-components [16]
were age, gender, and ethnicity. The poverty income
ratio (PIR) grouped into three categories (<1.25, 1.25‒
3.49, and >3.49) and physical activity (sedentary, mod-
erate or vigorous based on questionnaire responses),
current smoking status, alcohol intake (g/d), and
energy intake for nutrient-related variables (with the
exception of energy intake itself or HEI-2010) also
served as covariates. The PIR values reflected the
federally established poverty criteria, thus a PIR of
<1.25 equated to below 125% of poverty, while higher
values represented the subject was from a higher in-
come status. The HEI-2010 provides a measure of diet
quality and measures conformance to federal dietary guid-
ance and has been predominantly used to monitor dietary
practices of the US population and the low-income sub-
population. Nutrient intakes were also adjusted for energy
intakes. The main comparison of interest was to compare
results between the no consumption of main grain groups
(cluster 0) and all other clusters. A conservative P-value of
p < 0.01 was set for significance.
Results
Eight grain clusters were identified, one of which in-
cluded isolating a group of children and adolescents that
did not consume any of the identified grains (4.0% of the
population). The eight clusters are defined as outlined in
Table 1, namely: 1) no consumption of main grain
groups, 2) cakes, cookies and pies 3) yeast breads and

Energy and nutrient intakes
Energy intake was significantly higher for children and
adolescents in all grain pattern clusters, with the excep-
tion of ‘cereals’ (p = 0.089), when compared to the no
grains group. The higher energy intake ranged from 416
‒ 524 kcal/d with ‘pancakes, waffles, French toast and
other grains’ and ‘quick breads’ clusters representing the
greatest increase in kcal/day (Table 2).
Energy adjusted nutrient intakes in the eight grain food
patterns are presented in Table 2. When examining nutri-
ents of concern, as outlined by the 2015–2010 DGA [1],
no differences in calcium intake was observed in children
all of the grain clusters compared to those not consuming
grain foods, while dietary fiber was higher in children
consuming ‘yeast breads and rolls’
, ‘cereals’
, ‘pasta, cooked
cereals and rice’
, ‘crackers and salty snacks’
, and ‘quick
breads’
, ranging from 1.8 ‒ 2.8 g/day greater daily fiber
than children and adolescents in the no grains group.
In terms of nutrients (i.e., vitamins and minerals)
present naturally or added to grain foods, via either en-
richment or fortification practices, nutrient intakes were
higher for those in certain grain clusters. Iron intake was
greater across all seven grain clusters examined, thus
demonstrating the relevance of both the naturally occur-
ring and added iron in contributing to this 2015–2020
DGA shortfall nutrient. Daily vitamin D (D2 + D3) was
significantly greater only in children and adolescents
consuming a ‘cereals’ grain pattern, while no significant
differences were observed with potassium intakes in any
of the grain clusters as compared to those not consum-
ing grain food products. Intakes of thiamin were signifi-
cantly higher for children and adolescents consuming all
grain clusters, except for ‘cakes, cookies and pies’
, while
daily intakes of riboflavin were significantly greater all
grain patterns, with the exception of ‘cakes, cookies and
pies’
, ‘pasta, cooked cereals and rice’ and ‘crackers and
salty snacks’ when compared to those not consuming
grain foods. Similarly, folate was higher (76 ‒ 411 μg/d;
all p < 0.0001) in those in all grain food clusters, except
‘cakes, cookies and pies’
, relative to the no grains cluster.
Zinc intake was higher only in children and adolescents
consuming ‘yeast breads and rolls’
, ‘cereals’ and ‘pasta,
cooked cereals and rice’ and significantly lower in those
consuming ‘cakes, cookies and pies’ compared to those
in the no grains cluster. Magnesium intakes were greater
in children and adolescents consuming ‘yeast bread and
rolls’
, ‘pasta, cooked cereals and rice’
, and ‘quick breads’
relative to the no grains group (Table 2).
Regarding nutrients to limit, daily saturated fat intake
was significantly lower in all grain patterns examined,
with the exception of ‘yeast breads and rolls’ and ‘quick
breads’
, compared to those not consuming grain foods,
with a range of difference in saturated fat ranging from
1.5 ‒ 4.8 g less per day. Daily sodium intake was only
lower (approximately 350 mg/day) in children and ado-
lescents consuming ‘cakes, cookies and pies’ compared
to the no grains cluster pattern. There were no signifi-
cant differences in total and added sugar intake across
all grain clusters as compared to the no grain cluster
(Table 2).
Diet quality assessment
Diet quality, as measured by USDA’s HEI-2010 is
depicted in Table 3. Four of the grain clusters had
significantly greater scores when compared to the no
grains cluster. Specifically, those in the ‘pasta, cooked
cereals and rice’ had the greatest score at 50.6 ± 1.0, while
children and adolescents consuming ‘yeast breads and
rolls’
, ‘cereals’ and ‘crackers and salty snacks’ had scores of
46.1 ± 0.5, 48.5 ± 1.2, and 46.0 ± 0.4, respectively (all p <
0.001) compared to the no grains cluster (42.7 ± 0.9).
When examining the subcomponents of HEI-2010
(Table 3), children and adolescents in the ‘crackers, salty
snacks’
, ‘pancakes, waffles, French toast and other grains’
and ‘quick breads’ had significantly lower total vegetable
scores than subjects in the no grains pattern. Children and
adolescents in all grain clusters examined had significantly
greater scores for whole grains as compared to those not
consuming grain foods, which indicated higher consump-
tion of whole grains (see Table 3). Children and adoles-
cents in the ‘cakes, cookies and pies’ grain cluster were the
only cluster to show significantly higher scores for sodium
intake relative to individuals not consuming grains. The
lower HEI-2010 sub-component scores were more than
offset with increased scores for those in the ‘yeast breads
and rolls’
,‘cereal’
,‘pasta, cooked cereals and rice’ and ‘crack-
ers and salty snacks’ clusters for total fruit, whole fruit and
whole grains as compared to those not consuming grain
foods. Additionally, children and adolescents consuming
‘yeast breads and rolls’
, ‘pasta, cooked cereals, and rice’
,
‘crackers and salty snacks’ and ‘quick breads’ had signifi-
cantly higher scores for greens and beans, while the ‘ce-
reals’ cluster showed higher dairy scores in comparison to
children and adolescents in the no grains pattern. The sig-
nificantly greater score for empty calories in the ‘pasta,
cooked cereals, and rice’ cluster translates as fewer calories
from solid fats, alcohol and added sugars), while those
consuming ‘cakes, cookies and pies’ ingested more calories
from solid fats, alcohol and added sugars relative to the no
grains dietary pattern.

 reported associations between grain pattern consump-
tion, energy and nutrient intakes and diet quality. The
current data support that a variety of grain food pat-
terns, including those recommended by dietary guidance
and those that focus on enriched and fortified grain
staples, are associated with greater nutrient intakes, in-
cluding higher consumption of shortfall nutrients and
nutrients of public health concern as identified by the
2015–2020 DGA [1], in comparison to an alternative
dietary pattern that does not emphasize grain-based
foods in children and adolescents. The findings from the
present study are aligned with recently published data in
American adults, where consumption of specific grain
foods were associated with greater nutrient intakes, in-
cluding greater consumption of shortfall nutrients and
nutrients of public health concern. Several, but not all
grain food patterns, were associated with improved diet
quality compared to adults not consuming main grain
groups. Adults consuming pasta, cooked cereals and rice
also had lower body weights and smaller waist circum-
ferences when compared to individuals not consuming
grain foods [7].
Several nutrients contributed by grain foods natur-
ally or via fortification/enrichment, including folate,
calcium,
magnesium,
fiber
and
iron
are
under
consumed relative to IOM nutrition standards [17].
Dietary patterns that encourage nutrient-dense grain
foods, with the concept of limiting sodium, total fat
and sugar, may help shift population consumption in
children
and
adolescents
toward
recommended
intake levels for several shortfall nutrients identified
by 2015 DGAC [17]. Additionally, creating positive
habits including nutrient-dense dietary patterns that
include whole and enriched grain consumption in
earlier years may benefit health outcomes into adult-
hood [18, 19]. Indeed, the current research in children
and adolescents provides a sound rationale to support
more specific dietary guidance for American children
and adolescents about grain consumption rather than
simply having two broad categories of recommended in-
takes that revolve around refined/enriched and whole
grains. The current data illustrates how various enriched
grain products contribute to daily nutrient intakes and
overall diet quality. For example, we observed that chil-
dren and adolescents consuming ‘yeast breads and rolls’
,
‘cereals’
, ‘pasta, cooked cereals and rice’
, and ‘crackers and
salty snacks’ grain patterns had a significantly higher diet
quality, as measured by USDA’s HEI-2010 and dietary
fiber intake was significantly greater in five of the eight
patterns, ranging from 1.8 ‒ 2.8 g more daily fiber, as com-
pared to those consuming no grain foods. It is rationale to
suggest that these daily increases in dietary fiber can have
a meaningful impact on public health initiatives by helping
to minimize gaps in fiber consumption in children and
adolescents. In fact, a recent study evaluating ten-year
trends in fiber intakes using NHANES data from 2001–
2010 in children and adolescents reported mean fiber in-
take to be 13.2 ± 0.1 g/day [20]. Thus, dietary fiber intake
levels in children and adolescents continue to fall short of
meeting dietary guidance based on recommendations set
forth by the Institute of Medicine where fiber Adequate
Intake in children 1 ‒ 8 years and children and adolescents
9–18 years is set at 19 ‒ 25 g/day and 26 ‒ 38 g/day, re-
spectively [21].
Collaborative efforts from the American Heart Associ-
ation, American College of Cardiology and The Obesity
Society state that nearly one-third of children and youth
are overweight or obese, further exacerbating poor
health profiles and increasing risks for chronic diseases
and their co-morbidities [22, 23]. In the current analyses,
total fat intake was lower in, ‘cereals’ and ‘pasta, cooked
cereals and rice’
, and daily saturated fat intake was lower
in many of the grain patterns examined, in comparison
to the no grains food pattern. The range of saturated fat
lowering per day translates to meaningful reductions when
considering the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Daily
Value (DV) for saturated fat; the mean lowering of saturated
fat ranged from 1.5 ‒ 4.8 g per day which represents 7.5 ‒
24% of the DV for adults and children ≥4 years of age con-
suming 2000 kcal/day. Taken collectively, some grain food
patterns, comprised of both whole and enriched grains, can
be beneficial in children and adolescents when considering
dietary guidance and health outcomes.
Our results are aligned with previous observational
findings that considered sources of nutrients in the US
diet. When identifying the top food sources of nutrients,
including both intrinsic and added to foods via fortifica-
tion, results showed that grain foods represented the top
five ranking food sources for folate, such that ready-to-
eat cereals, yeast breads and rolls, pizza, pasta and
crackers, popcorn, pretzels, and chips contributed 56.7
and 54.4% of folate to the diet of children and adoles-
cents, respectively. Results were similar another shortfall
nutrient, such that grain foods represented the top five food
sources for iron in the diet of US children and adolescents,
with ready-to eat cereals, yeast breads, pizza, cakes, cookies,
and pies, and crackers, popcorn, pretzels, and chips cumula-
tively contributing 52.1 and 48.7% of iron [24].
The 2015–2020 DGA and 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advis-
ory Committee (2015 DGAC) report further states ‘of the
shortfall nutrients, calcium, vitamin D, fiber, and potassium
also are classified as nutrients of public health concern be-
cause their under consumption has been linked in the scien-
tific literature to adverse health outcomes” [21], a principle
carried forward from the DGA 2010 policy document [25].
The 2015 DGAC [17] also reports that “if whole grains were
consumed in the amounts recommended in the recom-
mended
food
patterns,
whole
grains
would
provide
Papanikolaou et al. Nutrition Journal  (2017) 16:13 
Page 8 of 10
 substantial percentages of several key nutrients, such as
about 32% of dietary fiber, 42% of iron, 35% of folate, 29% of
magnesium and 16% of vitamin A”. While these nutrients
levels represent significant contributions from whole grains,
whole grain consumption alone can still leave a gap between
consumption and recommendation levels. The 2005 DGAC
reported that refined grains contribute substantial levels of
key nutrients to food patterns, naming folate, iron, calcium,
dietary fiber, thiamin, riboflavin and niacin [26], thus dem-
onstrating the importance of consuming both enriched and
whole grains. The committee further acknowledged that in-
cluding only three ounce equivalents of whole grains daily
with no refined grains in recommended food patterns would
lower intake of many of key nutrients and potentially place
specific populations at risk for nutrient inadequacy [26]; an
argument which led the 2015 DGAC to conclude that con-
sumption of whole grains with no substitutions would result
in nutrient shortfalls [17]. The current analysis provides data
linking different grain food patterns with nutrient intakes
and concurrently we observe the adverse nutrient- and
health-related outcomes when grain foods as a whole are
eliminated from the diet. In many of the grain patterns ex-
amined, we see a better overall nutrient intake profile, which
demonstrates the important dietary contributions made by
different grain foods and emphasizes the importance of con-
suming a balance of whole grains, enriched and fortified
grain products. Indeed, while some of the grain food clusters
contributed nutrients to limit in the diet as identified by the
2015–2020 DGA [1], including saturated fat, added sugars,
and sodium, several of the grain food patterns were associ-
ated with lower intakes of these nutrients and improved
shortfall nutrients and diet quality. Such findings provide a
rationale for more specific, evidence-based dietary guidance
around grain consumption.
There are several limitations to the present analysis
that deserve recognition. Data for energy and nutrient
intakes, including values reported for diet quality, were
obtained using 24-hour dietary recalls, which rely on
study participant memory. While validated procedures
are used to collect the data, recalled information may be
inaccurate and biased from misreporting or memory
challenges [27]. In addition, the current evidence, being
observational, cannot establish a causal link between the
different grain foods patterns examined and improve-
ments in nutrient intakes and diet quality. However, a
large strength of the current work stems from the use of
NHANES, which is a large continuous survey that exam-
ines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 in-
dividuals yearly by highly-trained medical personnel.
Additionally, numerous covariates were used to adjust
the data in an attempt to remove potential confounding
scenarios. However, residual confounding may still exist
and may explain some of the results reported. Lastly, we
identified a small percentage of the population with no
consumption of the main grain groups investigated,
which served as the comparison group. While the com-
parison group was relevant for research purposes, it only
represented 4% of the population, suggesting that further
research is required.
Conclusions
Several grain food dietary patterns in U.S. children and
adolescents are associated with greater nutrient intakes, in-
cluding greater consumption of shortfall nutrients and nutri-
ents of public health concern as identified by the 2015–2020
DGA. Improved diet quality, as measured by USDA’s HEI-
2010 was also linked to consumption of specific grain food
patterns, including ‘pasta, cooked cereals and rice, ‘cereals’
,
‘yeast breads and rolls’ and ‘crackers and salty snacks’
, when
compared to those children and adolescents not consuming
grain food dietary pattern. Improved diet quality was due
not only to the contribution of nutrients inherent in the
grain, but also to those added through enrichment and forti-
fication practices and those provided by natural food pair-
ings such as cereal and dairy foods (i.e., milk). Overall, while
some grain food patterns were associated with elevated so-
dium and added sugar, the present data also support that
several grain food patterns can serve as part of a healthy
dietary food pattern in children and adolescents, that
accounts for 2015–2020 DGA dietary recommendations to
reduce total fat, saturated fat and added sugar consumption,
while concurrently increasing intake of shortfall nutrients
and/or nutrients of concern, including iron, magnesium,
dietary fiber, vitamin D, potassium and folate.
