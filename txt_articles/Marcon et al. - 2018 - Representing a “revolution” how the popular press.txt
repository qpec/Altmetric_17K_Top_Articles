 Representing a “revolution”: how the popular press has
portrayed personalized medicine
Alessandro R Marcon, MA1, Mark Bieber, BSc2 and Timothy Caulfield, LLM, FRSC1,3
Purpose: This study investigated the portrayal of “personalized” and
“precision” medicine (PM) in North American news over the past
decade. Content analysis of print and online news was conducted to
determine how PM has been defined and to identify the frames used to
discuss PM, including associated topics, benefits, and concerns.
Methods: A data set was built using the FACTIVA database,
searching for popular North American publications with the terms
“personalized (personalised) medicine” and/or “precision medicine”
from 1 January 2005 to 15 March 2016. The final set of publications
totaled 774.
Results: PM is almost exclusively defined as related to genetics and is
often part of a story related to cancer. The PM story is overwhelmingly
one of highlighting (potential) benefits and optimism, especially in
shorter publications, and ones where PM is not the main focus. This
promotional PM discourse has remained fairly consistent over the past
decade.
Conclusion: The numerous concerns associated with PM have
received little attention over the past decade, especially in articles more
likely to be encountered by a more general audience. This promotion
of PM serves as an example of the science hyping that takes place in
science reportage and may have implications for consumers, public
expectations, and related health policy.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, the hopes, benefits, and concerns as well
as the use of technological and scientific advancements in the
overlapping fields of genetics, medicine, science, and health
care in approaches now commonly referred to as precision or
personalized medicine have attracted a significant amount of
media attention. The appointment of precision-medicine
proponent Francis Collins to the role of director of the
National Institutes of Health, the announcement of President
Obama’s Precision Medicine Initiative, and the emergence of
numerous direct-to-consumer genetics-related health compa-
nies such as 23andMe, have all played a role in this rise of
media discourse. Although the terms “personalized medicine”
and “precision medicine” (PM) have become the most
commonly used in this context, they still lack singular,
concrete definitions.1,2 Many other terms have been used in
similar contexts, including “stratified medicine,” “P4 medi-
cine,” “genetic medicine,” and “personalized genomics.”2,3
The creation and ultimate popularization of the term “PM,”
despite its somewhat varied use, have the fundamental roles of
synthesizing under a unified title a range of genetics-related
health-care practices through which information and knowl-
edge exchanges can take place among scientists, government,
industry, and the public at large. Thus, while PM, as a term,
remains something of a fluid social construct, taking on
diverse meanings based on the context as well as the manner
in which it is used, a general, working definition of PM can be
understood as “an emerging approach for disease treatment
and prevention that takes into account individual variability
in environment, lifestyle, and genes for each person.”4
PM is typically presented as striving toward making health
care more “personalized, predictive, preventive, and partici-
patory.”2 It has been portrayed as a means to optimize care5–7
and to empower both patients and the general public to
participate more in treatment decisions as well as to take
greater preventive measures.7 It has also been argued that PM
will
improve
health-care
efficiency
and
reduce
system
costs.8–10 Furthermore, it is thought not only that PM will
help accelerate the development of new drugs for rare or
neglected diseases11 but also that drugs previously deemed
ineffective might find new uses.7 Often, when PM is promoted
to the general public, it is portrayed as representing a
“revolution”12 or part of a “breakthrough”13,14 in health care.
For all its potential benefits, however, PM efforts have also
faced cautionary criticism. For example, commentators have
questioned the clinical value of the PM approach in many
contexts.1,15,16 In addition, evidence suggests that individuals
are unlikely to change their behavior in response to genetic
risk information,17,18 a common justification for the adoption
of PM strategies.19 There is also concern that the introduction
of PM might lead to increases in overdiagnosis, unnecessary
testing, iatrogenic injuries,20 and health-care costs.21 In
addition, the heavily promotional language often associated
with PM (such as the term “revolution”) has been criticized

 for contributing to inaccurate public representations of
science22 and unrealistic public expectations,23 as well as
facilitating a market for unproven products and services.24
Finally, some have suggested that an emphasis on PM may
result in an inappropriate shift from public health initiatives
to those focused on the individual.5,25 Because a large body of
research has detailed issues concerning the hype26 and overly
optimistic portrayals of biomedical research,27 a primary
analytical focus of this study was to assess the degree to which
PM has been portrayed as beneficial in light of the concerns
also being raised.
With these tensions in mind, the goals of this research were
to examine the portrayal of PM in popular print and online
North American news media over the past decade (2005–
2016), to determine how PM has been defined (as a process
related to “genetics” or otherwise), to identify the central
topics associated with PM, and to identify which—and the
extent to which—PM benefits and concerns have been
discussed.
The role of the popular press
Apart from the education system, mass media stands as the
primary source of health information for the general public.28
In addition, studies have shown a substantial interest in novel
advancements in health care and biotechnology; one reported
that almost 60% of Americans said they were “very interested”
in news about medical discoveries.29 While the factors
underlying the reporting and publication of health news are
numerous and complex,30 the media undeniably plays a role
in how the general public learns about, and makes sense of,
health-related topics. For example, studies have shown how
media attention on a particular topic can affect the public’s
utilization of health services.31 Other studies illustrate how the
media plays an influential “framing” role when covering
issues surrounding access to health care, at times highlighting
certain aspects of debates over others32 or in some cases
omitting important information concerning relevant risks and
limitations.33 The concept of “framing,” which has been taken
up and expanded on by theorists and communication
scholars, refers to the process of selecting, and in turn
emphasizing, particular stories, topics, themes, facts, and
actors over others.34 As a result of framing choices, certain
frames resonate more with particular audiences, gaining
stronger or weaker influence depending on the context.35
With regard to analyzing frames when performing content
analysis, choices can be made between analyzing generic or
issue-specific frames.36
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data collection
To capture the popular representation of PM in North
American news media, we used the FACTIVA database
(https://www.dowjones.com/products/factiva/) to collect both
print and online news stories appearing in the most popular
American and Canadian news sources, including newspapers,
magazines, and news-related websites. FACTIVA is a news
source database owned by Dow Jones in which elaborate
search inquiries can be performed and corresponding text—in
this case, articles—can be downloaded. Details on the
selection of news sources for this study can be found in the
Supplementary Material online.
After performing a Google “news” search on the wide range
of terms associated with PM (e.g., “personalized medicine,”
“personalized genetics,” “precision medicine,” “individualized
medicine,” “personalized treatment”) and recording the
number of search results for each term, we determined that
“personalized medicine” (also with the spelling “persona-
lised”) and “precision medicine” were the terms used most
frequently. While these two terms do not capture the totality
of
the
PM
discourse,
they
markedly
substantiate
the
popularization of the concept. These two terms were searched
in the FACTIVA database over the time period from 1
January 2005 to the day of collection: 15 March 2016. Because
our objective was to track and analyze PM discourse over
time, and because metrics such as Google Trends showed
consistent use of “personalized medicine” and “precision
medicine”—the latter with a sharp spike in the last 15 months
—it was determined that just over a complete decade would
provide an ample and sufficient data set.
A total of 1,477 articles were initially obtained. Duplicate
and irrelevant articles were excluded, resulting in a final data
set of 774 news articles. Articles were considered irrelevant if
PM was only mentioned or briefly defined but not discussed
in any detail and not connected to themes and topics
represented in the story.
Data analysis
Content analysis37—a systematic and replicable process of
analyzing text to make valid and objective inferences about a
particular social context—was then performed on the articles
to examine how PM was being framed in the media. This
process involved building a coding frame through a sample
analysis, which was then applied to all texts in the database.
The coding results serve as an accurate portrayal of the PM
communicative discourse. In this media study on PM, the
frames chosen were issue-specific and were determined both
inductively and deductively (an initial coding frame was
modified through an analysis of a data sample), with the
broad goal of mapping out which themes and topics become
associated with PM. Analyzing the framing tensions between
articles promoting PM and those raising concerns about PM
sheds light on how the general public is being informed about
these emerging technologies, and because the articles cover a
time span of more than a decade, whether the story has
changed or remained consistent over time. The final coding
frame included (i) information (metadata) about publication
date, headline, word count, author, and article source; (ii)
identification of article type, e.g., news, commentary, news
and commentary combined; (iii) the degree to which the
article focuses on PM; (iv) definition of PM; (v) general topics
associated with PM; (vi) mentions of specific health topics
related to PM; (vii) mentions of specific drugs related to PM;

 (viii) benefits attributed to PM; (ix) expected timeframe for
PM benefits to come into effect; (x) Concerns associated with
PM; and (xi) overall tone of the article with respect to PM.
The
complete
coding
frame
can
be
found
in
the
Supplementary Material, which provides the details of each
coding category.
Assessment of the tone of the article was based on the
presence and analysis of benefits versus concerns. An article
detailing and stressing PM benefits but not PM concerns was
coded as “positive.” An article predominantly detailing PM
benefits but also mentioning and stressing some concerns was
coded as “mostly positive.” The same process with the inverse
values was undertaken to code articles “negative” and “mostly
negative.” Articles were coded “neutral” if the benefits and
concerns of PM were detailed in equal measure, or if a
definitive emphasis on either side could not be determined.
Because the coding aspect of content analysis can have
subjective variance, we tested just over 10% (n = 84) of the
articles for intercoder reliability. Following a consensus-
reaching session in which intercoder human error was
corrected and category requirements were clarified, we
achieved a mean κ score of 0.814 across all categories,
demonstrating
“strong”
agreement
based
on
stringent
standards.38 Complete κ scores for each category can be
found in Supplementary Table S1. For category v (general
topics), an agreement score (κ = 0.583) was achieved, which
illustrates only “weak” agreement. Some inconsistencies in
coding for this category were found, as there were ambiguities
when demarcating university research, government initiatives,
and biotech industries. These data have been included in the
analysis because they provide a general mapping of the topics
through which PM is framed but do not weigh heavily on
conclusions drawn from analysis. For category ix (timeframe
of PM benefits coming into effect), we obtained weak
agreement (κ = 0.483) and therefore removed all data
pertaining to this category from our analysis.
RESULTS
Of the 774 articles included in the final data set, 539 (69.6%)
were from US news sources and 235 (30.3%) were Canadian.
The numbers of articles per year and the total number of
articles appearing in each US and Canadian news source are
shown in Supplementary Figures S1–3. With respect to
article type, 391 (50.5%) were “news,” 205 (26.5%) “news and
commentary,” and 178 (22.9%) “commentary.” With respect
to degree of PM focus, in 338 (43.7%) of the articles, PM was
the “main focus” and in 436 (56.3%) it was not. Regarding
definitions, PM was defined as something based solely on
genetics in 675 (87.2%) articles, as something related to
genetic procedures as well as other processes in 46 (5.9%)
articles, and as something not related to genetics in 53 (6.8%)
articles. Regarding general topics, PM was associated with
university research in 40.1% of articles, with biotechnology in
32.9% and government initiatives in 22.9%. PM was discussed
in the context of specific medical procedures in 13.0% of
articles and was connected to direct-to-consumer companies,
products, or services in 9.9%. These data are shown in
Supplementary Figure S4. With respect to “other” topics
associated with PM, present in only 5.4% of the articles, 18
articles focused on legal proceedings, and 5 touched on topics
related to fundraising, philanthropy, and competitions. The
topic of ELSI (ethical, legal, and social implications) debates
was raised in four articles.
More than 120 specific health topics appear in the 774
articles, but cancer had substantially the largest presence,
appearing in 441 (56.9%) articles. The next most discussed
health topics included diabetes, in 71 (9.2%) articles; heart
disease, in 56 (7.2%) articles; cystic fibrosis, in 53 (6.8%)
articles; and Alzheimer disease, in 50 (6.5%) articles. No other
health topic appears in more than 6% of the total articles. For
a complete list of all health topics mentioned in at least five
articles, refer to Supplementary Table S2.
In 210 (27.1%) articles, reference is made to specific drugs.
A total of 125 different drugs are mentioned in the articles, 86
of which are mentioned only once. All drugs mentioned in at
least 5 articles are listed in Supplementary Table S3.
With regard to the benefits of PM, 709 articles (91.6%)
describe eight principal PM benefits and seven “other”
benefits. Of these 709 articles, 354 (49.9%) detail only one
benefit, 259 (36.5%) detail two, and 76 (10.7%) detail three. Of
the 354 articles that detail only one benefit, 284 describe the
efficacy of current or future PM-related treatments and 28
describe the benefit of PM-related prevention. Text examples
of the efficacy of PM treatments are provided in the
Supplementary Material. Sixty-five (8.4%) articles discuss
PM without detailing any benefits. The overall presence of
PM benefits is displayed in Figure 1. For cases where PM was
seen as beneficial in terms of creating more patient autonomy
or helping to assist in the prevention of diseases, we coded the
rationale stated for doing so. In these cases, increased
screening and monitoring (including ease of access to
screening and monitoring) were mentioned in 118 (15.2%)
articles.

 were equated with decreasing the burden placed on the
health-care system in less than 1% of articles. PM was
described as a beneficial means for “advancing science”—
progressing the scientific understanding of humans and
environments regardless of whether a specific practical
application for that knowledge could be discerned—in 77
(9.9%) articles.
In addition to highlighting the benefits of PM, articles
raised numerous PM concerns. The total number of articles
raising concerns about PM, however, as displayed in Figure 2,
was significantly lower than that of articles describing its
benefits: 253 articles (32.7%) raised PM concerns while 521
(67.3%) did not.
We coded for 13 specific concerns as well as an open
category labeled “other” (see Supplementary Material online
for the complete list). The most common concern centered on
the “limited clinical or health value of genetic information,”
which was expressed in 90 (11.6%) articles. Economic cost
concerns were mentioned in 79 (10.2%) articles. The other
concerns present in more than 5% of articles included “other”
(or miscellaneous) in 44 (5.7%) articles, the “exaggeration of
benefits” in 43 (5.6%) articles, government regulations and
policies (e.g., questions about how to regulate DTC products,
issues over when health care systems should use and/or fund
genetic tests, etc.) in 38 (4.9%) articles, and concerns
surrounding access to and control of data, in 41 (5.3%)
articles. Concerns not present in more than 4% of articles
included concerns related to genetic literacy, too much
medicine (e.g., issues related to overdiagnosing, diagnostic
cascade, or iatrogenic injury), genetic discrimination, patents,
managing
information,
doctors’
knowledge/expertise
in
interpreting genetic data, and ELSI topics pertaining to race,
ethnicity, and ancestry, as well as the potential for increased
inequality in health-care systems. For “other” (miscellaneous)
topics, two topics made up 45.5% of the 44: the accuracy of
genetic tests (in 11 articles) and emotional issues (anxiety,
false hope, and helplessness) for PM patients (in 9 articles). In
terms of PM tone, the articles were overwhelmingly positive,
as shown in Figure 3.
PM values, the presence of concerns, and the story over
time
Concerns and PM focus
In calculating the presence of concerns when PM is the main
focus versus when it is not (i.e., PM is referred to but is not
the principal topic of the news story), the data reveal that
more concerns are present when PM is the main focus. Of the
articles in which PM is the main focus (43.7% of all the
articles), concerns are mentioned in 39.1%. In contrast, of
the articles in which PM is not the main focus (56.3% of all
the articles), an even smaller proportion mention concerns:
27.1% of the articles. Supplementary Figures S5 and S6
present this information.
Concerns and word count
The data show a relationship between length of article and
presence of concerns. The average length of articles was
approximately 1,000 words. Analysis by category—articles with
fewer than 500 words, 500–1,000 words, 1,000–1,500 words, and
more than 1,500 words—showed an increasing presence of
concerns with increasing word count, as shown in Figure 4.

 a portrayal of PM benefits and concerns—shows a fairly
consistent pattern with no obvious directional trends.
DISCUSSION
Analyzing the PM news stories appearing over the past 10
years reveals key aspects of how PM has been framed and
demonstrates that PM is largely portrayed in a promotional or
positive light. Regarding PM health topics, PM is most
typically presented in a story related to cancer. Other health
topics, such as diabetes, heart disease, cystic fibrosis, and
Alzheimer disease, receive some PM-related attention but
considerably less, and PM in connection with topics such as
cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, autism, Crohn
disease and Parkinson disease are seldom discussed in the
popular press. General readers of PM-related news are
therefore more likely to associate PM with cancer and are
probably exposed to considerably fewer PM-related develop-
ments and issues pertaining to a wide range of health topics.
Furthermore, there generally seems to be consensus in the
popular press regarding the definition of PM. It is used,
rightly or not, almost exclusively to define procedures, topics,
or themes related to genetics. For those who believe that PM is
really a broader concept—one that encompasses a variety of
factors relevant to a patient, including relationships, socio-
economics, and lifestyle—this finding will undoubtedly be
frustrating. However, it also speaks to how successful those
invested in branding the concept of PM have been, especially
since our research has observed a fairly consistent framing
over the study period. In the popular sphere, PM is primarily
about genetics. This raises interesting questions, worth further
investigation, about whether this popular culture emphasis
may facilitate an inappropriate de-emphasis of important,
nongenetic, factors relevant to population health.
Another major theme is optimism. PM is almost always
framed as positive or mostly positive (in 82% of the articles).
Only a small percentage of the articles present PM in a negative
light. Furthermore, nearly all articles (approximately 92%) detail
specific PM benefits, such as the effectiveness of current or
prospective PM treatments. In contrast, the exaggeration of PM
benefits, which is commonly raised by critics concerned about
the lack of data surrounding PM,15 is mentioned in only 6% of
articles. This conclusion aligns with past research that has
mapped the phenomenon of science hype,39 showing genetic
research to be portrayed in a predominantly positive manner
and as part of a near-future “revolution.”14 Future research
should (continue to) explore whether the positivity surrounding
the portrayal of PM is translating into an increased demand by
the public for genetics-related testing. This would be especially
worthwhile seeing as this study highlights increased screening
and monitoring as a core PM benefit.
Another strongly promoted benefit of PM is its potential
ability
to
encourage
preventative
health
measures
and
increase
patient
autonomy.
Specifically,
several
articles
present PM as a way to assist individuals in adopting
beneficial lifestyle changes, including screening behavior, diet,
and exercise. Given that existing research suggests that the
provision of genetic-risk information has little impact on
behavior change,16,17 these media representations seem out of
step with the existing research. Indeed, the inaccurate
representations of the empowerment message stand as a
good example of how the media portrayals of PM may
mislead both the public and policy makers about the value of

 some PM technologies. Given that previous research has
highlighted the potential impact of media representations on
utilization patterns, policies, and public expectations,31,33
these results may be cause for concern. In addition, these
media portrayals may facilitate the marketing of unproven
direct-to-consumer genetic testing services23 by making
unsubstantiated marketing promises—which often include
messages of empowerment—seem more plausible.
Given the dominance of the enthusiastic portrayals, it is
somewhat ironic that the most common concerns found in
the popular press focus on the limited value of genetic
information and the problems of exaggerated claims of benefit
(e.g., questioning the ability of PM to enable preventative
measures). In other words, when concerns are found in the
popular press, they often touch on the problems of overly
enthusiastic portrayals of benefit. But critiques of this kind are
only seldom presented in popular PM news stories.
Another interesting theme that emerged from our data was
that longer and more PM-focused articles were, in general, more
balanced (that is, mentioned both benefits and concerns). For
example, articles focusing specifically on PM were more likely to
highlight concerns (39%), compared with articles mentioning
PM as part of a broader news story (27%). Broader news stories,
therefore, including those pertaining to, for example, business/
finance, government initiatives, or technological developments,
generally describe PM in a more optimistic or promotional tone
than do articles that focus on PM specifically. This serves as an
example of “implicit hype,” a phenomenon that has been noted
with other emerging health technologies,40 whereby the news
media simply takes benefits for granted. Audiences encountering
the topic of PM through news stories that are more general in
scope are even more likely to be exposed to a positive portrayal
of PM than audiences reading specifically about PM. This trend
is also evident in analyzing article length. As shown in Figure 4,
the longer an article is, the more likely it is to highlight concerns
surrounding PM. As such, readers more on the periphery of
PM-related news stories, encountering only shorter articles that
describe PM using fewer words and less detail, are probably
exposed to more favorable or optimistic representations of PM
than those reading longer, more detailed analyses. Again, this
plays into the hyping associated with PM,26 which, as a result,
has the potential to create not only unrealistic expectations14 but
could lead to an erosion of trust and/or enthusiasm surrounding
science more generally.27
The primary limitation of our study was in our choice of
search terms. There is an abundance of terms associated with
personalized or precision medicine. While terms such as
“individualized medicine,” “genetic medicine,” and “persona-
lized genomics” appeared in Google news searches with
substantially less frequency than “personalized medicine” or
“precision medicine,” it is possible that including a wider
range of search terms in our query would have resulted in a
data set of articles highlighting different PM-related benefits,
topics, and concerns. Further research could take this
approach, exploring whether there are similar or dissimilar
discourses between various PM-related terms.
Ultimately, this study captured the popularization and framing
of what is now commonly known and referred to as personalized
or precision medicine. It shows that in popular discourse, PM
has been framed in a consistent manner: as a positive health-care
trend associated with few concerns. Given the power of the
media to shape public discourse, including patient expectations,
this could have implications for the implementation of PM
technologies. To date, the concerns associated with PM have
received little attention. This is unfortunate. The public discourse
would benefit from a more balanced and nuanced framing.
