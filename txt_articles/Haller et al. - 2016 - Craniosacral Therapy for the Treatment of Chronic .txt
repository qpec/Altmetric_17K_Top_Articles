Objectives: With growing evidence for the effectiveness of craniosacral
therapy (CST) for pain management, the efficacy of CST remains
unclear. This study therefore aimed at investigating CST in compar-
ison with sham treatment in chronic nonspecific neck pain patients.
Materials and Methods: A total of 54 blinded patients were
randomized into either 8 weekly units of CST or light-touch sham
treatment. Outcomes were assessed before and after treatment
(week 8) and again 3 months later (week 20). The primary outcome
was the pain intensity on a visual analog scale at week 8; secondary
outcomes included pain on movement, pressure pain sensitivity,
functional disability, health-related quality of life, well-being,
anxiety, depression, stress perception, pain acceptance, body
awareness, patients’ global impression of improvement, and safety.
Results: In comparison with sham, CST patients reported significant
and clinically relevant effects on pain intensity at week 8 (�21mm
group
difference;
95%
confidence
interval,
�32.6
to
�9.4;
P =0.001; d= 1.02) and at week 20 (�16.8mm group difference;
95% confidence interval, �27.5 to �6.1; P =0.003; d=0.88).
Minimal clinically important differences in pain intensity at week 20
were reported by 78% within the CST group, whereas 48% even had
substantial clinical benefit. Significant between-group differences at
week 20 were also found for pain on movement, functional disability,
physical quality of life, anxiety and patients’ global improvement.
Pressure pain sensitivity and body awareness were significantly
improved only at week 8. No serious adverse events were reported.
Discussion: CST was both specifically effective and safe in reducing
neck pain intensity and may improve functional disability and the
quality of life up to 3 months after intervention.

N
eck pain is a significant public health problem with 1 in
2 people experiencing neck pain at least once in their
lifetime.1 Neck pain is often recurrent, of nonspecific
nature, and associated with disability in both social and
occupational life.2–4 For the treatment of chronic courses,
evidence is still limited, as only therapeutic exercises, acu-
puncture, and manual therapies were recommended in
recent clinical practice guidelines.5–7 On asking manual
therapists about their perception and use of complementary
and alternative medicine for the treatment of chronic pain
conditions, one repeatedly mentioned treatment was cra-
niosacral therapy (CST).8
CST is thought to be a noninvasive, mindfulness-
based treatment approach using gentle manual palpation
techniques to release fascial restrictions between the cra-
nium and the sacrum.9 The craniosacral system anatomi-
cally encompasses the structures of the central nervous
system including the skull, the cranial sutures, the cere-
brospinal fluid, and the membranes of the brain and the
spinal cord. It is influenced by and linked to the
musculoskeletal system,10 and presumably to the vascular
and endocrine system as well as to the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous system.11 In the craniosacral
theory, fascial restrictions within the craniosacral system
lead to abnormal, arrhythmic motion of the cerebrospinal
fluid. This craniosacral rhythm is assessable by palpa-
tion and quantifiable by encephalogram, myelogram,
and magnetic resonance imaging.12 There is also growing
evidence for fascial involvement in pain chronification.
Studies have shown increased activity of fascial noci-
ceptors within restricted connective tissue, which can
contribute to remodeling processes of inflammation and
fibrosis, increased tissue stiffness, muscle tension, and
chronic pain.13,14 However, research on craniosacral
diagnostic and treatment mechanisms revealed very het-
erogenous results,11,12 with only preliminary evidence
supporting inherent processes of peripheral and descend-
ing
pain
inhibition
due
to
gentle
fascial
palpation
techniques.11,15,16
The effectiveness of craniosacral treatment on health
outcomes has been shown for a number of chronic pain
syndromes, but it is limited to observational designs and
randomized
controlled
trials
with
low
to
moderate
methodological quality.17–19 Efficacy studies and studies on
musculoskeletal pain have not been conducted to date,20
although neck and back pain were the most frequent
symptoms for which CST was requested.21 Therefore, this
study aimed at investigating the efficacy of CST in chronic
nonspecific neck pain in comparison with a manual sham
control intervention.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Design and Registration
The study was designed as a randomized controlled
clinical trial with a parallel-group design and 3 months of
follow-up observation. After baseline assessment, patients
were randomized into either the CST group or an active
attention-control group receiving light-touch sham treat-
ment. Outcome measures were collected at week 8 after
randomization (after intervention) and week 20 after
randomization (3-month follow-up). The trial was con-
ducted between February 2012 and May 2013 at the
Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Kliniken
Essen-Mitte, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Ger-
many. Before patient recruitment, the trial protocol was
approved by the ethics committee of the University of
Duisburg-Essen, Germany (11-4850-BO), and registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01526447).
Randomization
A statistician who was not involved in conducting the
study generated a nonstratified allocation sequence with
randomly varying block lengths using the random number
generator RANUNI from the SAS/STAT software (release
9.2, SAS Inc.). On the basis of these random number tables,
he prepared sealed and opaque envelops sorted in the
ascending order of randomization. To reveal patients’
group assignment, the envelop with the lowest number was
opened directly after each baseline assessment by the trial
coordinator who was involved neither in the random
sequence generation nor in the assessment of study
outcomes.
Sample Criteria
Patients were recruited from specialist care, primary
care, and noncare populations through advertisements. To
assess eligibility, those who called were screened by a
research assistant, whereupon eligible patients obtained
written study information and a physical and neurological
examination by a study physician. If all eligibility criteria
were met, patients had to give written inform consent and
were included in the study.
Inclusion criteria were an age of 18 to 65 years, chronic
nonspecific neck pain for 3 months or more with at least
moderate pain intensity of Z45 mm on a 100-mm visual
analog scale (VAS),22 and treatment naivety with respect to
CST. Participation was not possible in cases of specific neck
pain due to degenerative diseases (disk prolapse, scoliosis),
inflammatory diseases (spondylitis, arthritis), neurological
diseases (neuropathy, multiple sclerosis), physical trauma
(whiplash, operation at the cervical spine), or neoplasms of
the spine. Severe comorbid somatic and psychiatric dis-
orders such as oncological diseases or major depression and
current pregnancy also were exclusion criteria. Patients
taking corticosteroids, opiates, muscle relaxants, anti-
depressants, or those with recently initiated or modified
drug therapy or invasive/manipulative treatment were also
excluded.
The sample size was calculated on the basis of pain
intensity ratings of chronic nonspecific neck pain patients
who received osteopathic manipulative treatment23 using
the G*Power software (release 3.1.3, Kiel University, Ger-
many).24 To detect an expected group difference
of
1.73 ± SD of 2.16 on a 10-point numeric rating scale (effect
size of 0.84) with a power of 80%, a 2-sided t test with
a = 5% significance level required 24 patients per group.
Accounting a possible loss of statistical power due to
patient withdrawal of 10%, a total sample size of 54
patients was calculated.
Blinding
First, patients were blinded to the group allocation
and to the fact that 1 group would receive sham treatment
as it was recommended for manual therapy trials25; instead
they were told that 2 different CST techniques would be
tested. Second, investigators assessing outcomes remained
blind to patients’ group allocation during the whole study
period. Third, the statistician who conducted outcome
analyses was blinded to the group allocation by renaming
the groups with numbers.
Interventions
Standardized treatment protocols comprised 8 units of
CST or sham treatment once a week lasting 45 minutes
each. Patients of both groups received initial structural CST
examination, which was repeated at the end of each unit,
and was treated by 1 of 4 licensed physiotherapists with
advanced CST qualification, and on average 6 years of
clinical practice. Treatment steps were recorded by thera-
pists using a structured log.
The Treatment Group
The CST protocol was designed to release restrictions
of the cranium and the spine up to the pelvis and the sac-
rum using standardized application of gentle fascial trac-
tion, release, and unwinding techniques in accordance with
the respective palpated restrictions.26,27 The techniques
applied included frontal and parietal lift, medial com-
pression of the parietal bones, release of the sagittal suture
and the atlanto-occipital joint, compression-decompression
of the sphenobasilar and the temporomandibular joints,
cranial base release, release of the hyoid diaphragm and the
thoracic inlet, dural tube traction, respiratory and pelvic
diaphragm release, lumbosacral and sacroiliac decom-
pression, fascial unwinding of the neck/shoulders and lower
limbs, and still point induction.9,15 If indicated, dialog
techniques for increasing body awareness and assisting the
process of somato-emotional release were used.28
The Sham Control Group
The sham protocol was designed to be credible but not
specifically effective. Therefore, light touch was applied on
standardized anatomic areas, equal to those treated with
CST, for 2 minutes each time.29,30 In addition, body
awareness instructions were given to simulate CST dialog
techniques.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was an average pain intensity
during the last 7 days, recorded on a 100-mm VAS at week
8.31 Secondary outcomes were pain on movement, pressure
pain sensitivity, neck pain-related disability, health-related
quality of life, well-being, anxiety and depression, stress
perception, pain acceptance, body awareness, patients’
global impression of improvement, and safety.
To assess pain on movement, patients obtained the
Pain on Movement Questionnaire and were asked to rate
the pain intensity on a 100-mm VAS while flexing,
extending, laterally flexing, and laterally rotating their
head. The average pain on movement score was then

 calculated from all movement directions.32 Pressure pain
sensitivity was measured at the individual point of max-
imum pain and bilaterally at anatomically predefined sites
(levator scapulae, trapezius, and the semispinalis capitis
muscle). For these points, pressure pain thresholds were
determined 3 times each using a digital algometer (Somedic
AB, Ho
¨ rby, Sweden) with a 1-cm2 cylinder. Pressure was
applied in steps of 40 kPa/s until patients stated pain in
addition to pressure.33,34 Functional disability was assessed
using the Neck Disability Index, a 10-item questionnaire
that enquired the disability in daily activities induced by
neck pain. Scores of <9 indicate no perceived disability, 10
to 29 mild disability, 30 to 49 moderate disability, 50 to 69
severe disability, and 70 to 100 complete disability.35
Health-related quality of life was assessed on 2 subscales,
physical and mental quality of life, using the 12-item Short
Form Health Survey. Subscales were standardized to a
mean of 50 ± SD of 10 and a range of 0 to 100, with 0
indicating the lowest level and 100 the highest level of
health.36 Well-being was measured by the sum score of the
16-item Questionnaire for Assessing Subjective Physical
Well-being (FEW-16).37 Anxiety and depression were
measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
Each subscale is composed of 7 items with a maximum of
21 points. Scores below 8 indicated anxiety and depression
levels within normal limits, 8 to 10 points indicated sub-
clinical levels, and over 10 points a possible clinical dis-
order.38 To assess stress perception, patients obtained the
Perceived Stress Questionnaire in the 20-item version.39
Pain acceptance was measured by the 8-item Positive Life
Construction Scale of the Emotional/Rational Disease
Acceptance Questionnaire.40 Body awareness was measured
by the Scale of Body Connection, which is composed of 2
subscales:
Body
Awareness
and
Body
Dissociation.41
Patients’ ratings of their Global Impression of Improve-
ment (PGI-I) were assessed on a 7-point scale from 1 (very
much improved) to 7 (very much worse).42,43 Safety
assessment was realized by asking patients at the beginning
of each treatment unit about the frequency and the severity
of side effects. In addition, patients were requested to
document side effects as well as concurrent treatment and
medication use in a daily log.
Furthermore, treatment expectancy was assessed as
part of the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire on a 9-
point rating scale from 1 (not at all) to 9 (very much).44,45
Treatment credibility and quality of the therapeutic alli-
ance, measured by the Helping Alliance Questionnaire,46
were analyzed and reported separately.47
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat
population
including
all
patients
who
were
initially
randomized, regardless of whether they had missing data or
were not fully adhering to the treatment protocol. Missing
at random values were imputed 20 times using fully con-
ditional specification iterations, a multiple imputation
technique based on multivariate regression models of
baseline values and sociodemographic parameters.
Dropout analyses and baseline comparability were
analyzed using independent-samples t tests for continuous
data and w2 tests for categorical data. Concurrent medi-
cation use was converted into defined daily doses (DDD)48
and analyzed using repeated measures analysis of cova-
riance with the treatment group as the classified factor and
patients’ expectations as the linear covariate. The primary
outcome was analyzed as a function of the treatment group
(classified factor), patients’ expectations, and respective
baseline values (linear covariates) using univariate analysis
of covariance. Between-group differences (D) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using 2-sided t
tests, and an alpha level of 5%. Equal models were applied
for secondary outcomes, which were analyzed were explor-
atory. This way, no alpha-level adjustment for multiple
testing was necessary.49 For each outcome, standardized
effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated by dividing estimated
group differences by the pooled SD at baseline. In addition,
responder
analyses
were
calculated
for
patients
who
improved by at least 20% of their respective baseline values
(minimal clinically important difference) and for patients
with at least 50% improvement (substantial clinical bene-
fit).50,51 Between-group differences for treatment response
analyses were tested with w2 tests. All analyses were per-
formed using the SPSS software (release 22.0, IBM).
RESULTS
Patient Recruitment and Flow
Figure 1 displays the Consort flow chart of patient
recruitment and loss during the study period. Out of 150
initially interested patients, 96 had to be excluded because
of not fulfilling the eligibility criteria or for reporting
scheduling problems. In total, 54 patients were randomized
and allocated to 1 of the 2 treatment groups. Whereas 4
patients from the CST group and 8 patients from the sham
group did not attend all treatment units provided, only 3
patients were lost to assessment at week 8. Reasons for
dropout were scheduling problems and loss of interest. At
week 20, dropout of 7 patients was recorded due to
scheduling problems, whereas 2 others made no further
reply. Comparisons of patients who completed the study
with those who were lost to week 8 and week 20 revealed no
significant differences concerning their social demographics,
neck
pain
characteristics,
and
treatment
expectancy
(PZ0.05) (Table 1).
Sample Characteristics at Baseline
Patients’ baseline characteristics are shown in Table 2.
Their ages ranged from 19 to 65 years, with a mean of
44.6± 10.0 years. All were whites. Most were female
(81.5%), employed, and of normal body mass index. The
sample included patients from all educational levels, which
were equally distributed. Patients reported 9.6± 8.9 years of
neck pain duration, and most of them had received several
pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments during
that time. No significant differences in patients’ social dem-
ographics and neck pain characteristics were found between
study groups (PZ0.05). Patient’s expectations that CST
would be successful in reducing their neck pain symptoms
were also comparable between groups (PZ0.05).
Concurrent Treatments
Patients’ use of concurrent pain medication is illus-
trated in Figure 2. During the 8 weeks of treatment, the
average intake of analgesics was 0.1 ± 0.1 DDD in the CST
group and 0.5 ± 0.3 DDD in the sham group. Analysis
revealed no significant main effect of time (P = 0.716) and
group (P = 0.099), and no significant time-group inter-
action (P = 0.069). Other concurrent treatments were
reported by 5 patients in the sham group who used massage
4 times and acupuncture 2 times.

 Primary Outcome
Effects on the primary outcome are shown in Table 3.
In comparison with sham, patients in the CST group
reported a significantly lesser pain intensity of D =
�21.0 mm at week 8 (95% CI, �32.6 to �9.4; P = 0.001;
d = 1.02) and n = �16.8 mm at week 20 (95% CI, �27.5
to �6.1; P = 0.003; d = 0.88).
A minimal clinically important pain reduction of at
least 20% was reported by 74.1% of the CST patients
against 40.7% of the sham patients at week 8 (P = 0.013),
and 77.8% of the CST patients against 51.9% of the sham
patients at week 20 (P = 0.046). A substantial clinical
benefit of at least 50% pain relief at week 8 was reported by
44.4% of the CST patients against 14.8% of the sham
patients (P = 0.017). At week 20, a comparison of 50%
response rates did not reach the level of significance
(P = 0.091) (Table 4).
Secondary Outcomes
Analyses of secondary outcomes are also shown
in Table 3. At week 8, significant between-group differences
were detected for pain on movement (P = 0.001; d = 0.92),
pressure pain thresholds at the point of maximum pain
(P = 0.038; d = 0.52), and bilaterally at the trapezius
muscle
(P = 0.042;
d = 0.43),
functional
disability
(P = 0.010; d = 0.73), physical quality of life (P = 0.013;
d = 0.64),
body awareness (P = 0.001; d = 0.59), and
global improvement (P = 0.000; d = 1.01). At week 20,
significant effects could be detected for pain on movement
(P = 0.020; d = 0.66), functional disability (P = 0.006;
d = 0.80), physical quality of life (P = 0.000; d = 1.07), and
global improvement (P = 0.029; d = 0.62). Although anx-
iety and depression levels were reduced in the CST group
and increased in the sham group, between-group compar-
isons were significant only for anxiety and only at week 20
(P = 0.020; d = 0.58). No significant group differences were
found for stress perception, well-being, mental quality of
life, pain acceptance, and body dissociation (PZ0.05).
Safety
No serious adverse events were reported. Minor
adverse events during or subsequent to the treatment were
reported by 6 patients in the CST group and included
increased neck pain in 2 patients and pain in the jaw area,
shivering,
tiredness,
strong
emotional
reactions,
and
weeping in 1 patient, respectively. Within the sham group, 8
patients reported minor side effects, which included tran-
sient headache or migraine in 7 patients, worsened neck
pain in 3 patients, tingling sensations in 2 patients, and
dizziness in 1 patient. In all reported cases, symptom wor-
sening subsided shortly after the respective treatment unit.
Another 2 patients, 1 from each group, discontinued study
participation in consequence of recurrent headache during
treatment, but were free of headaches at both follow-up
assessments.

 DISCUSSION
Summary of Evidence
The present study is the first randomized controlled
trial that revealed efficacy for CST in comparison with
manual sham treatment. In a patient sample with a mean
duration of 9.6 years of nonspecific neck pain, significant
and clinically relevant effects on the pain intensity were
found directly after the active treatment period and at week
20, a further 3 months later. Minimal clinically important
differences in pain intensity at week 20 were reported by
almost 78% within the CST group, whereas 48% even had
substantial clinical benefit. An exploratory analysis also
revealed significant between-group differences at weeks 8
and 20 for pain on movement, functional disability, phys-
ical quality of life, and patients’ global impression of
improvement. Pressure pain sensitivity and body awareness
were significantly improved only directly after 8 weeks of
treatment, and anxiety only at week 20. No serious adverse
events were reported.
Results are in line with previous pain research in CST
and recommended neck pain treatments. Although CST
was shown to be effective in improving pain intensity,
functional disability, and health-related quality of life in
comparison with waiting list,52 relaxation,53,54 off-state
physical devices,55,56 or standard medical care,57 this study
found comparable effects in blinded patients with respect to
sham. The effect sizes are comparable to those of neck pain
guideline treatments58–61 and more than likely cannot be
explained exclusively by nonspecific treatment effects,
which were found to be only of small to medium effect
sizes.62 Specific effects of the used CST techniques seem to
be probable, given the broad nociceptive and low-threshold
mechanosensory innervations of the fasciae,16,63 Treating
fasciae has been shown to induce a decreased tone of
intrafascial muscle cells, decreased muscles tension, and
increased parasympathetic nervous system response and
vagal tone, in vitro63 and in vivo.64 Pain relief, decreasing
muscles tension, and the experience of deep relaxation and
release were also reported by the interviewed patients
treated with CST.65,66 Further described results of CST
included the reduction of state and trait anxiety, whereas
depression levels were often not influenced significantly.29,56
Adverse events have been reported only by 1 randomized
controlled trial in detail, with temporarily increased symp-
toms and tiredness occurring most often.57 In the CST
theory, such transient symptom aggravation, tiredness, and
the described emotional release reactions are usually
understood as positive vegetative responses to treatment,28
which were also reported in studies of osteopathy, massage
therapy, and acupuncture.67–69
Strengths and Weaknesses
The strengths of the study design included the random
and concealed allocation procedure, the intention-to-treat
analysis, the active attention-control and touch-control
condition, comparable concurrent treatments, and the
successful blinding of patients47 and outcome assessors.
However, there are certain limitations. First of all, the
sample size was relatively small and consisted of 81.5% of
female patients, which may reduce the representativity and
the generalizability of the results. Even so, the analyses
conducted had adequate statistical power, suggesting com-
parable results even in bigger samples. Epidemiological

 surveys otherwise show a generally higher neck pain prev-
alence in women,1,3 which in turn would explain the greater
percentage of included women compared with men. Second,
the comparability of the CST and the sham groups may be
limited due to the allocation to the therapists. Whereas 3
therapists performed CST, only 1 therapist performed the
sham treatment. However, secondary analyses have shown
that the alliance to the assigned therapists did not system-
atically affect study outcomes.47 Nonetheless, the treatment
protocols used only allow for conclusions about the effect of
CST on subjective clinical outcomes. It remains unclear
whether CST techniques actually affect the indicated fascial
structures and joints, and if so, whether these changes in
turn would result in quantifiable physiological responses.
The design therefore would have to include further objective
physiological measures and an even more standardized
application of fascial palpation techniques.
CONCLUSIONS
CST was shown to be specifically effective and safe in
reducing neck pain intensity and may improve the func-
tional disability and the quality of life up to 3 months after
the intervention. Particularly in chronic and recurrent neck
pain, CST may be a worthwhile treatment option in addi-
tion to standard medical care. Further studies with rigorous
methodological designs and long-term follow ups are
needed to confirm CST efficacy in neck pain treatment.
