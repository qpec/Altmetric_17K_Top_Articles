Sleep is critical for regulation of synaptic efficacy, memories, and learning. However, the underlying mechanisms of how sleep rhythms
contribute to consolidating memories acquired during wakefulness remain unclear. Here we studied the role of slow oscillations, 0.2–1
Hz rhythmic transitions between Up and Down states during stage 3/4 sleep, on dynamics of synaptic connectivity in the thalamocortical
network model implementing spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity. We found that the spatiotemporal pattern of Up-state propa-
gation determines the changes of synaptic strengths between neurons. Furthermore, an external input, mimicking hippocampal ripples,
delivered to the cortical network results in input-specific changes of synaptic weights, which persisted after stimulation was removed.
These synaptic changes promoted replay of specific firing sequences of the cortical neurons. Our study proposes a neuronal mechanism
onhowaninteractionbetweenhippocampalinput,suchasmediatedbysharpwave-rippleevents,corticalslowoscillations,andsynaptic
plasticity, may lead to consolidation of memories through preferential replay of cortical cell spike sequences during slow-wave sleep.

Introduction
Sleepconstitutesapproximatelyone-thirdofourlives.Duringsleep,
human and animal brains are primarily decoupled from sensory
input. Nevertheless, brain activity remains high and is manifested in
various types of sleep-specific synchronized rhythms (Frank, 2012).
It was proposed that sleep plays a critical role in memory consolida-
tion, in which newly acquired information during wakefulness is
transformed into long-term memory during sleep (Born, 2010).
Specifically,slow-wavesleep(SWS)hasbeenshowntofacilitatecon-
solidation of declarative, hippocampus-dependent memory (Gais et
al., 2000; Marshall et al., 2006; Marshall and Born, 2007; Barnes and
Wilson, 2014), whereas rapid eye movement (REM) sleep can ben-
efit procedural, hippocampus-independent memory (Born, 2010).
SWS, often referred to as deep sleep, consists of stage 3/4 of
non-REM (NREM) sleep. Slow-wave brain activity, observed
during SWS in humans and animals (Steriade et al., 1993), is
characterized by large-amplitude slow oscillations (0.2–1 Hz) in
the electroencephalograph (Blake and Gerard, 1937), reflecting
alternating periods of active (Up) and silent (Down) states in the
intracellular recordings of thalamic and cortical neurons (Ste-
riade et al., 2001). Previous studies have pointed to the impor-
tance of SWS in memory consolidation. In humans, it has been
shown that enhancing SWS by transcranial electrical stimulation
can enhance memory consolidation (Marshall et al., 2006). In
rodents, during SWS, temporally ordered firing sequences re-
lated to a recent experience replayed in both hippocampus and
neocortex synchronously (Ji and Wilson, 2007; Mehta, 2007).
Such sequence replay has been proposed to be a neural substrate
of memory consolidation (Barnes and Wilson, 2014) and is be-
lieved to result in synaptic changes in the neocortex responsible
for integration of memory representations (Schwindel and Mc-
Naughton, 2011). Cognitive models based on experimental stud-

during deep sleep can underlie mapping hippocampal memory traces to persistent cortical representation. This study provided,
for the first time, a mechanistic explanation of how slow-wave sleep may promote consolidation of recent memory events.

suggested
a
distributed
role
for
memory representation, and the interac-
tion between the hippocampus and cortex
is proposed as a mechanism for consolida-
tion (McClelland et al., 1995; Rogers and
McClelland, 2006). Nevertheless, specific
neuronal mechanisms of replay and how
spike sequence replay leads to synaptic
changes that underlie memory consolida-
tion are hard to demonstrate in animals in
vivo and are still poorly understood.
To address these questions, we exam-
ined how synaptic connectivity in a bio-
logically realistic network model of the
thalamocortical system were changed by
and in return affected the spatiotemporal
pattern of sleep slow oscillations (Bazhe-
nov et al., 2002, 2011). Spike-timing-
dependent
plasticity
(STDP)
was
implemented to the cortical network to
regulate synaptic efficacy. Sparse external
stimulation was applied on a few cortical
pyramidal cells to mimic hippocampal in-
put during SWS. We found that even weak
and spatially localized input influenced
the spatiotemporal pattern of slow oscilla-
tions and led to a persistent change of syn-
aptic efficacy between neurons. These
synaptic changes remained even after the
input was removed and promoted the specific order of neuronal
firing, similar to sequence replay. Our study proposes a neuronal
mechanism of how the interaction between cortically generated
slow waves and sparse external input, simulating input from hip-
pocampal formation, may lead to reorganization of synaptic
strength during stage 3/4 sleep, therefore consolidating recent
memories.
Materials and Methods
Thalamocortical model
The network model (Fig. 1) incorporated a model of thalamus with
thalamic relay (TC) and reticular (RE) neurons, as well as a model of
cortical column with pyramidal neurons (PY) and inhibitory interneu-
rons (IN; Bazhenov et al., 2002, 2011). All neurons were modeled based
on the Hodgkin–Huxley kinetics. The units and description of parame-
ters were summarized in Table 1.
Intrinsic currents: thalamus
TC and RE cells were modeled as a single compartment that included
voltage- and calcium-dependent currents described by Hodgkin–Huxley
kinetics (Bazhenov et al., 2002):

where Cm � 1u F/cm 2 is the membrane capacitance, gL is the leakage
conductance (0.01 mS/cm 2 for TC cell and 0.05 mS/cm 2 for RE cell), and
EL is the reversal potential (�70 mV for TC and �77 mV for RE). I syn is
the sum of synaptic currents. I int is the sum of active intrinsic currents
that include a fast sodium current, INa, a fast potassium current IK (Traub
and Miles, 1991), a low-threshold Ca 2� current, IT, for RE (Huguenard
and Prince, 1992) and TC (Huguenard and McCormick, 1992) cells, and
a potassium leak current, IKL, where IKL � gKL(V � EKL), gKL is the
potassium leakage conductance, and EKL is the potassium reversal poten-
tial. A hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih (Huguenard and
McCormick, 1992), was included in TC neurons. Therefore, the sum of
active intrinsic currents for RE and TC are

transition rates for all currents were given in a previous study (Bazhenov
et al., 1998).
Fast sodium current INa. The INa current is described by
INa � gNam 3h(V � ENa),
where gNa is the maximal sodium conductance (90 mS/cm 2 for TC,

the conductances between the axosomatic and dendritic compartment,
where R � 10 M� is the resistance between compartments. VD and VS are
themembranepotentialsofdendriticandaxosomaticcompartments.Inthis
model, we set the capacitance of axosomatic compartment to be 0 (Chen et
al., 2012). This model was first proposed (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1996) as a
reduction of a multicompartmental pyramidal cell model, based on the as-
sumptionthatthecurrentdynamicsintheaxosomaticcompartmentarefast

In PY cells, ID
int included a fast sodium current, INa, a persistent sodium

compartment. IS
int included a fast sodium current, INa, a persistent so-
dium current, INa(p), and a fast delayed rectifier potassium current, IK, in
the axosomatic compartment. The persistent sodium current, INa(p), was
included in the axosomatic and dendritic compartments of PY cells to
increase bursting propensity. IN cells have the same intrinsic currents as
those in PY except that INa(p) is not included. The ratio of dendritic area
to axosomatic area was � � 165 for PY and � � 50 for IN.
Fast sodium current INa. The INa current is described by
INa � gNam 3h(V � ENa),
where gNa is the maximal sodium conductance (3000 mS/cm 2 for soma,
0.8 mS/cm 2 for dendrite). ENa � 50 mV is the reversal potential of

Persistent sodium current INa(p). The INa(p) current is described by
INa(p) � gNa(p)m(V � ENa),
where gNa(p) is the maximal persistent sodium conductance (15 mS/cm 2

where gKm is the maximal slow voltage-dependent noninactivating po-
tassium conductance (0.02 mS/cm 2). EK � �90 mV is the reversal po-
tential of potassium. The expressions of transition rates are

Slow calcium-dependent potassium current IKCa. The IKCa current is de-
scribed by
IKCa � gKCam(V � EK),
where gKCa is the maximal slow Ca 2�-dependent K � conductance (0.3
mS/cm 2). The expressions of transition rates are
�m � 0.01[Ca2�]i,

where [Ca2�]i is the intracellular calcium concentration.
High-threshold calcium current IHVA. The IHVA current is described by
IHVA � gHVAm 2h(V � ECa),
where gHVA is the maximal high-threshold Ca 2� conductance (0.02 mS/
cm 2). ECa � 140 mV is the reversal potential of calcium. The expressions

Calcium dynamics. For each cell, the calcium dynamics is described by a
simple first-order model:

where [Ca]� is 2.4 � 10 � 4 mM, indicating equilibrium calcium concen-
tration, A � 5.1819 � 10 � 5 mM cm 2/(ms �A) and � � 5 ms.
Synaptic currents
The equations for all synaptic currents are given in previous studies
(Timofeev et al., 2000; Bazhenov et al., 2002). GABAA, AMPA, and
NMDA synaptic currents are given by
Isyn � gsyn�O� f�V��V � Esyn�.
where gsyn is the maximal conductance, [O] is the fraction of open
channels, and Esyn is the reversal potential (EAMPA � 0 mV, ENMDA �
0 mV, and EGABAA � �70 mV). Here f(V) � 1 for GABAA and AMPA
receptors, but for NMDA receptor, it is a voltage-dependent sigmoid
function f(V) � 1/(1 � exp(
�
(V � Vth)/�)), where Vth � �25 mV,
and � � 12.5 mV (Traub and Miles, 1991; Chen et al., 2012). The
maximal conductances for each synapse were gGABAA(RE�TC) �
0.15 �S, gGABAA(RE�RE) � 0.125 �S, gAMPA(TC�RE) � 0.35 �S,
gAMPA(TC�PY) � 0.1 �S, gAMPA(TC�IN) � 0.05 �S, gAMPA(PY�PY) �

andgNMDA(PY�PY)�0.005�S.Thefactionofopenchannel[O]iscalculated
according to the equation
d[O]/dt � �(1 � [O])[T] � �[O],
�T] � A�(t0 � tmax � t)�(t � t0),
where �(x) is the Heaviside function and t0 is the time of receptor acti-
vation. The amplitude and duration of the neurotransmitter pulse were
A � 0.5 and tmax � 0.3 ms. The rate constants were � � 1.1 ms and � �
0.19 ms for AMPA receptors, � � 1 ms and � � 0.0067 ms for NMDA
receptors, and � � 10.5 ms and � � 0.166 ms for GABAA receptors.
In the intracortical connections, GABAA, and AMPA synaptic currents
are modified by a short-term depression term D (Timofeev et al., 2000):
Isyn � Dgsyn[O]f(V)(V � Esyn),
where D represents the amount of available “synaptic resources.” D was
calculated according to the following interactive scheme (Timofeev et al.,
2000):
Dn�1 � 1 � �1 � Dn�1 � U�� exp � � �t/��,
where �t is the time interval between nth and (n � 1)th spike, � (700 ms
for AMPA and GABAA) is the time constant of recovery of the synaptic
resources, and U (0.073 for GABAA, 0.07 for AMPA) is the fraction of
resources used per action potential.
GABAB synaptic current is given by the following (Destexhe et al.,
1996a):
IGABAB � gGABAB([G] 4/([G] 4 � K))/(V � EK)
d[R]/dt � K1(1 � [R])[T] � K2
d[G]/dt � K3[R] � K4[G]
where [R] is the fraction of activated receptors, [G] is the concentration
of G-proteins, gGABAB � 0.04 �S, and EK � �95 mV is the potassium
reverse potential. The rate constants were K1 � 0.52 mM � 1ms � 1, K2 �
0.0013 ms � 1, K3 � 0.098 ms � 1, K4 � 0.033 ms � 1, and K � 100 �M 4.
Network geometry
The cortical column included three layers: layer II/III/IV, layer V, and
layer VI. Each layer was organized in a one-dimensional chain of n PY
neurons and n/4 INs, where n � 200 in this model. The radii of
connections between cortical neurons were RAMPA(PY�PY) � 5,
RAMPA(PY�IN) � 2, and RGABAA(IN�PY) � 5. We varied RAMPA(PY�PY)
� 5–7 in layer V to confirm that layer V is the most likely site of
Up-state initiation across layers for Figure 2. The thalamus model
consisted of core and matrix systems (Jones, 2001). Each system con-

neurons within each system were RGABAA(RE�TC) � 6, RGABAB(RE�TC)
� 6, RGABAA(RE�RE) � 4, and RAMPA(TC�RE) � 4. The core TC neu-
rons projected to the middle layers of the cortex (layer II/III/IV)
(RAMPA(TC�PY) � 5 and RAMPA(TC�IN) � 1), whereas the matrix TC
neurons projected to the superficial layer (layer I) whose cell bodies were in
the layer V (Jones, 2001) (RAMPA(TC�PY) � 20 and RAMPA(TC�IN) � 4). The

cortical layer V to the matrix thalamus system were RAMPA(PY�TC) � 10 and
RAMPA(PY�RE) � 5.
Mechanism of initiation and termination of Up states
Slow oscillation in the model was driven by intracortical dynamics.
Spontaneous summation of miniature EPSPs (mEPSPs) through AMPA-
mediated synapses among pyramidal neurons triggered Na � spikes in
some (randomly located) PY neurons, which then initiated spikes in their
postsynaptic neighbors (Timofeev et al., 2000; Bazhenov et al., 2002;
Chen et al., 2012). In the model, we set different state of the computer
system to change the random seed for different initial conditions. The
spread of activity within a cortical layer and between cortical layers was
mediated by the lateral excitatory connections, which limited the degree
of synchronization at active state onset.
The arrival times of spontaneous mEPSPs were modeled by Poisson pro-
cesses (Stevens, 1993), with time-dependent mean rate � � (2/(1 �

the last presynaptic spike (Timofeev et al., 2000). The mEPSP frequency (F)
and amplitude (A) within cortical layers were FPY�PY � 50, FPY�IN � 80,
APY�PY � 0.2 �S, and APY�IN � 0.05 �S. The mEPSP frequency and am-
plitude between different cortical layers were FPY�PY � 80 and APY�PY �
0.05 �S.
Different mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in termina-
tion of Up states. In our previous study of the slow oscillations based on
recordings from isolated cortical slab (Timofeev et al., 2000; Bazhenov et
al., 2002), we proposed that termination of Up states depends on (1) slow
adaptation currents such as Ca 2�-dependent K � current (IKCa) and (2)
synaptic depression. In another study, it has been proposed that termi-
nation may involve activation of the Na �-dependent K � current (IKNa)
(Compte et al., 2003). Finally, another model of slow oscillation pro-
posed that “depolarization-activated potassium currents and synaptic
depression terminate the Up state” without specifying the origin of the
depolarization-activated potassium current (Hill and Tononi, 2005).
More recently, we extended our model and proposed that activation of
the inhibitory interneurons can be involved in Up-states termination
(Chen et al., 2012); this model was able to explain higher synchrony of
Up-state termination versus initiation as it was reported in vivo. Our
current model incorporate all the properties mentioned above except for
IKNa.
Spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity
Synaptic plasticity leading to enhancement or depression in synaptic
strength is widely thought to underlie learning and memory storage in
the brain. Among the various forms of synaptic plasticity, we used STDP,
which adjusts the synaptic efficacy based on the relative timing of the
presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. The basic STDP is described by
(Song et al., 2000)
F��t� ��
A�e���t�/��, if
�t � 0
�A�e���t�/��, if

(3)
where �t, the spike time of postsynaptic neurons i minus the spike time
of presynaptic neuron j, determines whether the synaptic weight is
strengthened by long-term potentiation or weakened by long-term de-
pression. A� and A� determines the maximum amounts of synaptic
modification. Here, we set A� � A� � 0.0005, �� � �� � 20 ms.
In this study, excitatory synaptic connections within cortex layer were
implemented with STDP:
gAMPA 4 gAMPA � gmaxF(�t),
(4)
where gmax is the maximal synaptic conductance. If �t is positive, the
conductance of the excitatory-to-excitatory synapse is potentiated. If �t
is negative, the conductance is depressed. To limit the synaptic changes,
we assumed that the synaptic efficacy stays within an interval [0, gmax]. In
text, the synaptic weight was then normalized with gmax.
Spontaneously released glutamate vesicles can trigger mEPSCs. The
amplitude of mEPSC is thought to reflect postsynaptic receptor density.
Here, we assumed that synaptic plasticity affects the amplitude of mEPSC
(AmEPSC) (Pare
´ et al., 1997; Prange and Murphy, 1999):
AmEPSP 4 AmEPSC � fAmEPSC0F(�t),
where AmEPSC0 is an initial value of AmEPSC, and f � 0.01 is a factor
representing the change of STDP on AmEPSC is slower than on gAMPA.
Data analysis
Analysis of synaptic weight. The total input synaptic weight was measured
as the sum of the strength of all incoming synaptic weights at each neu-
ron, and the strength of recurrent connections was calculated by sum-

 ming the product of the weights along each of the recurrent loops
(incoming connection times outgoing connection). The spatial gradient
of synaptic weight of each neuron was calculated by the difference of total
input synaptic weight from the lower index neurons and the higher index
neurons. The sign of spatial gradient of synaptic weight determines the
direction of propagation. The positive value indicates that the wave pre-
fers to propagate from the lower index neuron to the higher index neu-
ron. The higher amplitude of spatial gradient of synaptic weight indicates
higher preference to propagate in one direction.
Up-state initiation detection. We first detected the timing of the onsets of
Up state for each neuron, which is mainly based on bimodality of the mem-
brane potential distributions (Volgushev et al., 2006) and the number of
spikes during a short interval (e.g., 30 ms). We then selected Up states only if
all the neurons are active simultaneously and their onsets should be sepa-
rated by �300 ms, called clusters (Volgushev et al., 2006). We defined the
neuron that actives first during an Up state as the initiation neuron.
Sequence detection and sequence replay measurement. We used two
methods to detect spike sequences. (1) We calculated the firing rate of
each cell by the number of spikes during a moving window (with a
window length 50 ms and window overlap 10 ms) divided by the dura-
tion of this interval and then smoothed it by a seven-point moving aver-
age. The firing sequences of neurons were determined by ordering the
peaks of their smoothed firing rate during each Up state. (2) Because
sequences are determined by the order of spike times, we computed a
cross-correlation of Gaussian convoluted spike trains between the Up-
state initiation neuron and all other neurons for each Up state. Based on
the cross-correlation analysis, we identified time delays (lags of the cross-
correlation peak) between neurons. This approach essentially gave us a
“mean” or characteristic delay between spiking of any two neurons. Sort-
ing these time delays provided the order of spiking of the neurons during
one specific Up state (spike sequence).
We then used two methods to quantify sequence replay. (1) For a small
subset neurons (e.g., four neurons), we calculated the probability of all
possible sequences of these neurons before stimulation, during stimula-
tion, and after stimulation. (2) For a large group of neurons, we applied
a string distance (SD) method to quantify how similar two sequences are.
The SD was calculated by SD (S1, S2) �

Statistical analysis. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to deter-
mine whether the sample data have come from a normal distribution. The
two-sample t test (for normal distribution) or the nonparametric Mann–
WhitneyUtest(fornon-normaldistribution)wasusedforstatisticalanalysis

ANOVA was used for comparisons across the multiple groups, with Bonfer-
roni’s post hoc test applied to determine the significant group. Two-way

quency groups with both periodic and Poisson stimulation (see Fig. 3C,D).

Results
Spontaneous slow oscillations in the thalamocortical
network model
The network model included a three-layer cortical network (lay-
ers II/III/IV, V, and VI) with PY cells and INs, as well as a two-
subsystem thalamic network (core and matrix; Jones, 2001;
Bonjean et al., 2012) with TC and RE neurons (Fig. 1). The model
spontaneously generated slow oscillations characterized by peri-
odic transitions between active (Up) and silent (Down) states
(Fig. 2A,B) with properties similar to recordings in vivo (Steriade
et al., 2001). The Up states of the slow oscillation were initiated
because of the summation of the spontaneous mEPSPs (minis)
between cortical PY cells during Down states (Timofeev et al.,
2000; Bazhenov et al., 2002). Although minis are rare events in
each synapse (Stevens, 1993), occasional summation of minis
across multiple synapses was sufficient to activate persistent Na �
currents and initiate spikes in one or few cortical cells, leading to
Up-state initiation. Excitatory connections between cortical neu-
rons (Bazhenov et al., 2002) and cortico-thalamo-cortical projec-
tions (Lemieux et al., 2014) mediated spread of activity over the
entire cortical and corresponding thalamic networks. Active
states were then terminated by the slow activation of the Ca 2�-
dependent K � current, synaptic depression (Timofeev et al.,
2000; Bazhenov et al., 2002), and the buildup of inhibition (see
Materials and Methods; Chen et al., 2012). The network switched
back to a silent state that was followed by initiation of the next Up
state, leading to oscillations (Fig. 2A,B). We found that the global
pattern of activity of PY cells was similar across cortical layers
(Fig. 2A,B, top). The TC and RE cells also showed active and
silent periods during corresponding Up and Down states in cor-
tical neurons (Fig. 2A,B, middle and bottom). In TC cells, the
active period usually consisted of a few spikes followed by sub-
threshold oscillations at 7–14 Hz and was commonly preceded by
a brief hyperpolarization attributable to inhibition from RE cells
in both the core and matrix subsystems. This spindle-like activity
was similar to recordings in experiments with cats (Timofeev and
Steriade, 1996).
Cortical and thalamic networks contributed to specific fea-
tures of the slow oscillations. Experimental studies (Sanchez-
Vives and McCormick, 2000; Chauvette et al., 2010) revealed that
Up states of the slow oscillations are more often initiated in layer
V neurons. In our model, higher probability of Up-state initia-
tion in layer V (Fig. 2C; p � 0.01, one-way ANOVA with Bonfer-
roni’s post hoc test) resulted from a higher number of synaptic
inputs to the layer V pyramidal neurons, based on anatomical
data of cortical connectivity (Thomson and Lamy, 2007). After
initiation in layer V, slow oscillations propagated to other layers
with a similar spatiotemporal pattern (Fig. 2A,B). Thalamic neu-
rons are known to play a role in synchronization of active states of
slow oscillation in vivo (Lemieux et al., 2014). In our model, the
Down-state duration was significantly increased when the thala-
mus was removed (Fig. 2D, see “No conn.” bar, p � 0.01, one-
way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test). We found that the
cortical network alone generated slow oscillation activity that was
similar to recordings in vitro in cortical slices and isolated cortical
slabs (Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000; Timofeev et al.,
2000). Thus, thalamic network was necessary to obtain in vivo-
like pattern of slow oscillation and to ensure that the synaptic
reorganization described in this study occurs in the presence of
the synchronized effect of matrix thalamic projections (Bonjean
et al., 2012; Lemieux et al., 2014).
We next examined statistical features of the spatiotemporal
pattern of the slow oscillations. In the model, spontaneous
spike-independent minis mediated transitions from silence to
active cortical states (Bazhenov et al., 2002; Chauvette et al.,
2010), and thus any network site could potentially initiate an
Up state (Fig. 3A, top and top middle). Initially, because of the
same synaptic connectivity, the probability of Up-state initia-
tion was nearly uniformly distributed across the network (Fig.
3A, bottom middle). Such distribution of Up-state initiation
sites remained regardless of initial conditions (initial states of

Wei et al. • Memory Consolidation during Sleep Slow Oscillations
 the random variables see Materials and Methods). Surpris-
ingly, we also found that a network site that initiated an Up
state at the previous cycle of oscillation was more likely to
initiate it at the following cycle (Fig. 3A, bottom). Such history
dependence resulted from the refractoriness of network. Dur-
ing an Up state, there was an accumulation of intracellular
Ca 2�, which led to a progressive increase in the hyperpolariz-
ing Ca 2�-dependent K � current; IKCa then decreased during
the Down state. This intrinsic current along with depression of
synapses led to a refractory-like period affecting the genera-
tion of the next Up state. Because Up-state initiating neurons
displayed slightly earlier termination compared with the rest
of the network, these neurons were released from the refrac-
tory period earlier and thus had higher likelihood to generate
the next Up state. Furthermore, the probability of synaptic
minis accumulation increased with time after termination of
the last Up state. This also facilitated initiation of the next Up
state at the same location where Up state was initiated in the
previous cycle. Our model suggests that intrinsic and synaptic
properties determine minimal time of Down- to Up-state
transition and ultimately minimal period of the slow oscilla-
tion. These results are consistent with in vivo in slab experi-

 ments, in which the period of slow oscillations depended on
the cortical network size (Timofeev et al., 2000). In cortical
slab with a reduced number of connections and limited size of
the neuronal population, slow oscillation became irregular
with an average period between Up states reaching up to 60 s
(Timofeev et al., 2000). Interestingly, keeping isolated cortical
slab in vivo for few days led (as we hypothesized) to homeo-
static changes, and the period of slow oscillations reached
again 1–3 s (Lemieux et al., 2014). Furthermore, it has been
reported that Up states recurred with a periodicity of 2–5 s in
vitro (Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000).
The history effect (mediated by hysteresis) alone could only
maintain repeatable pattern of Up-state initiation for up to
two or three cycles, so in a long timescale, the Up-state initia-
tions were uniformly distributed across the network without
plasticity or external input (Fig. 3A, bottom middle). Never-
theless, this effect helped to maintain the stereotyped Up-state
initiation pattern in the presence of even very sparse (in time)
hippocampal input because it was necessary for reliable syn-
aptic changes (see below).
External input influences the spatiotemporal pattern of
slow oscillations
It has been proposed that declarative memory is consolidated by
reactivation of neural representations of recent memories in the
hippocampus and the neocortex during SWS, leading to forma-
tion of persistent cortical memory traces (Marshall and Born,
2007; Born, 2010). The key element of consolidation stage is
cortical replay triggered by hippocampal sharp wave-ripple
(SPW-R) events (Peyrache et al., 2009). Experimental studies
have demonstrated that hippocampal neurons in CA1 project to
multiple regions in the medial prefrontal cortex (Jay and Witter,

Wei et al. • Memory Consolidation during Sleep Slow Oscillations
 1991; Hoover and Vertes, 2007; Parent et al., 2010). In our study,
we mimicked the hippocampal input to the neocortex with an
external stimulation to a small group of pyramidal cells. Each
input was a current step with 100 ms duration, which is similar to
characteristic ripple duration in vivo (50–150 ms; Sullivan et al.,
2011). We tested a broad range of inter-ripple intervals as found
in experiments (Axmacher et al., 2008). Figure 3B shows the
spatiotemporal pattern of cortical slow oscillation with a periodic
(1 Hz) external input applied to a group of three pyramidal cells
(cells 101–103) in layer II/III/IV of the cortical network. During
stimulation, the pattern of Up-state propagation became orga-
nized (Fig. 3B, top middle), and the majority of active states were
initiated around the stimulation site (Fig. 3B). This result is con-
sistent with the pervious findings with a one-layer cortical model
(Compte et al., 2003).
The probability of initiating an Up state at the simulation
location was highest when the frequency of stimuli was �1 Hz,
which was also the natural frequency of slow oscillation in our
model (Fig. 3C,D). Lower stimulation frequencies led to less re-
liable initiation. However, the probability of Up-state initiation
at the stimulation site remained above chance even for very low
input frequencies (Fig. 3D). The excess kurtosis of the Up-state
probability distribution peaked close to 0 for 1 Hz stimulation,
indicating a close to normal distribution (Fig. 3C). A two-way
ANOVA test showed that both periodic and Poisson distributed
inputs produced similar results (p � 0.8909 and 0.5733 for Fig.
3C,D, respectively, compare blue and black lines), but there was a
significant difference from the contribution of stimulation fre-
quency (p � 0.01 for both Fig. 3C,D). These experiments suggest
that even sparse hippocampal input could potentially influence
the spatiotemporal pattern of slow oscillations in the neocortex.
STDP leads to the appearance of local “groups” of neurons
initiating Up states
To explore effects of synaptic plasticity during slow oscillations,
we first considered the condition when there was no external
input to the network, and synaptic weights of the excitatory con-
nections between all cortical neurons were allowed to change
based on STDP rule (see Eq. 3). The synaptic changes were set to
be very small: spiking activity during a single Up state affected
synaptic weights by �1% of the initial value. In the presence of
STDP, the main spatiotemporal properties of the slow oscilla-
tions, including duration and frequency of Up states, remained
intact. However, because of the change of synaptic weights during
spontaneous slow oscillations, the probability distribution of ini-
tiation sites deviated from the uniform distribution (Fig. 4, com-
pared A,B). Some sites of the network (such as a group of
neurons around sites 50 and 150 in the network shown in Fig. 4B)
initiated Up states more often than other sites. In the model
without external stimulation, such preferential initiation sites
spontaneously emerged, and their location varied across simula-
tion trials with different initial conditions.
The emergence of the repetitive spatiotemporal pattern of
slow oscillation was determined by synaptic changes. Indeed, in
the model with STDP, the direction of Up-state propagation de-
termined whether the synaptic connection increased or reduced
after each wave (Up state) propagation. On average, connections
increased from any neuron that had Up state earlier in time to any
neuron that had it later in time, whereas the opposite connections
decreased, thus leading to strongly asymmetric weight distribu-
tion (neuron 100 in Fig. 4C). Because of the refractoriness of the
network, this effect could accumulate across cycles of slow oscil-
lation mediating systematic changes of synaptic weights.
To reveal how distribution of synaptic weights influences ini-
tiation of Up states, we examined whether total synaptic weight
per neuron, strength of recurrent excitatory connections, or spa-
tial gradient of synaptic weights along the network (see Materials
and Methods) could predict the site of Up-state initiation. Up
states were initiated more often within groups of neurons with
variable total synaptic strength (Fig. 4D, top). Among those neu-
rons, the neurons with maximal total synaptic input had many of
the incoming synapses reaching the upper limit (neuron 151 in
Fig. 4F; brown star in Fig. 4D), and the neurons with minimal
total synaptic input had many of the incoming synapses reaching
the lower limit (neuron 154 in Fig. 4F; blue star in Fig. 4D). The
neurons with maximal total synaptic input experienced high syn-
aptic (minis) drive during Down states and therefore could more
likely initiate a spike. Furthermore, because not all spikes could
lead to an Up state, Up states were initiated mainly at the network
sites in which recurrent excitatory connection strength between
pyramidal cells was high (Fig. 4D, bottom, blue line); this in-
creased the probability that an initial spike would trigger a wave
of excitation. Finally, close to zero spatial gradient of the total
synaptic weight per cell indicated locations of bidirectional wave
propagations that was also a predictor of the initiation site (Fig.
4D, bottom, green line). [The sign of the spatial gradient at a
specific location determined the preferential direction of wave
propagation. For example, for neurons 80–120, the spatial gradi-
ent was positive (Fig. 4D, bottom, green), indicating that the wave
propagation was primarily unidirectional and from the lower
index neuron to the higher index neurons.] For the sample net-
work shown in Figure 4D, we predicted that the group of neurons
(neurons 50–70) with highly variable synaptic weights, high re-
current synaptic strength, and close to zero spatial gradient of
synaptic weight was the main initiation site and another group
(neurons 160–170) formed the secondary site. This was indeed
consistent with the distribution of the probability of Up-state
initiation shown in Figure 4B.
The spatiotemporal pattern of slow oscillation, once it was
formed, remained throughout the simulation time (Fig. 4E).
Why did this pattern preserve? We found that locations of Up-
state initiation determined the dynamics of synaptic weights and
vice versa. This mutual interaction helped preserve the pattern.
Over time, the overall size of the regions of unidirectional wave
propagation slowly increased (Fig. 4G), forming a spatiotempo-
ral pattern with Up-state initiation occurring primarily in a few
specific locations. This may suggest that this spatial pattern of the
synaptic weights is an attractor state for the network.
External stimulation in the presence of STDP leads to input-
specific synaptic weight reorganization
Next we applied a periodic (1 Hz) stimulation to few cortical
pyramidal neurons (neurons 101–103) in layer II/III/IV. As be-
fore, the properties of the stimulation were designed to represent
minimal characteristics of the hippocampal ripples. We observed
that the probability of Up-state initiation at the stimulation sites
increased (Fig. 5B). As we showed in the previous section, inter-
action of the slow waves and STDP led to characteristic synaptic
changes; however, in presence of stimulation, these changes re-
flected input pattern to the network. Groups of cells with higher
probability of Up-state initiation have been formed, and their
location was not random but reflected location of the stimulation
sites. This pattern remained even after stimulation was removed
(Fig. 5, compare A,C). Importantly, this effect was independent
on the initial state of the network (initial conditions of all the
random variables; see Materials and Methods).

 In these experiments, external stimulation was applied at the
early stage of the network, so before the stimulation, synaptic
weights were distributed almost uniformly across the network
(Fig. 5D, left). During stimulation, Up states initiated mainly
near the input sites (Fig. 5B). This led to stereotyped wave prop-
agation and synaptic changes reflecting the propagation pattern
as we described previously (Fig. 4). Synaptic connectivity matrix
of many neurons became asymmetric, with connections from
one side of the network enhanced whereas the connections from
the other side reduced, except around stimulation sites. Such an
asymmetric synaptic pattern already emerged during the early
stage of stimulation (Fig. 5D, middle) and persisted after stimu-
lation was removed (Fig. 5D, right).
Why was Up-state initiation more likely to occur around stimu-
lation sites even after termination of the input? To answer this ques-
tion, we analyzed distribution of the total synaptic weight per
neuron, strength of recurrent excitatory connectivity, and spatial
gradient of synaptic weights along the network. Although relatively
large cell populations had highly variable synaptic weights (Fig. 5E),
recurrent connectivity and spatial gradient of synaptic weights
predicted initiation near site 100, where external input was
applied during the stimulation phase (Fig. 5F).

Wei et al. • Memory Consolidation during Sleep Slow Oscillations
 We interpreted these results as formation of long-term memory
representation in the cortical network after period of replay driven
byhippocampalripples.Thiseffectcanbegeneralizedtomorecom-
plex input patterns with multiple stimulation sites (Fig. 6A–C). We
found that both stimulation sites displayed higher probability to
initiate Up states during stimulation (Fig. 6B). After input termina-
tion,therewasarelativelyhighprobabilityofUp-stateinitiationnear
both stimulation sites, although one site (neurons 75–77) domi-
nated Up-state initiation (Fig. 6C, bottom).
We found that preexisting memory traces remained in the corti-
cal network after new stimulation was applied (Fig. 6D,E). Once the
first memory was imprinted into the network connectivity during
the first (earlier) stimulation period, it remained strongly expressed
after the second (later) stimulation (Fig. 6E). The second memory
trace integrated with the first one, forming two network sites with a
higher than average probability of Up-state initiation (Fig. 6E). Be-
cause of the small network size, only local intracortical synaptic con-
nectivityandreduceddimensionality(one-dimensionalnetwork)of
our model, these two memories shared some overlapping fragments
of the spike sequences. In a large-scale multidimensional system,
better approximating complexity of the animal and human brain,
we expect that different and non-overlapping sequences would rep-
resent different memories. Our study suggests that the mechanisms
of interaction between hippocampal inputs and cortical slow oscil-
lation can maintain storage of multiple memories. Mapping of the
new memories does not necessarily disrupt the previously stored
memories. However, we also found that the exact outcome of this
experimentdependsonthestrengthoftheearliermemory,whichin
our model depended on the duration of the first stimulation. We
found that, if the first stimulation was long enough leading to suffi-
ciently strong synaptic changes, then during stimulation at the sec-
ond site, both network sites continued to initiate Up states
simultaneously, resulting in a complex pattern with the interference
between two stimulation sites (data not shown). Thus, our results
suggest that the initial period of SWS is crucial for memory consol-
idation, consistent with experimental studies (Gais et al., 2000; Es-
chenko et al., 2008).

 an Up state (Fig. 5B,C). Here, we showed that such preferential
Up-state initiation results in repetition of the firing sequences of
neurons. First, we showed that, within an Up state, the relative
timing of the neuronal spiking is preserved on average and simi-
lar to that at the Up-state onset. Using cross-correlation analysis,
we found “mean” or characteristic delay between spiking of any
two neurons over the entire length of any given Up state. We then
compared these characteristic delays with those at the Up-state
onset and found that the order of cell spiking is primarily pre-
served from an Up-state initiation to its entire duration. To illus-
trate this result, we showed a typical Up-state spike pattern in
Figure 7A. Spikes in different neurons formed “stripes” during an
Up state following the same pattern as that at the onset of the Up
state. Characteristic delay between an Up-state initiating neuron
and any other neuron increased with distance from the Up-state
initiating neuron, reflecting wave propagation pattern (data not
shown).
Next, we demonstrated that all the Up states initiated from the
same neuron result in similar spike sequences. We used string
distance (SD) to measure similarity between sequences (for de-
tails, see Materials and Methods). For each network site (neu-
ron), we detected spike sequences from the Up states initiated at
that particular network location. Within these sequences, we then
calculated SD between every sequence and all the other sequences
(so, essentially, between all the pairs of sequences). This was re-
peated independently for each Up-state initiation site. Distribu-
tion of all the SDs calculated this way (Fig. 7B, blue) was
significantly lower than distribution of the SDs between every
sequence and all the other sequences of the subset with randomly
shuffled spike times, also repeated for each initiation site (Fig. 7B,
red). This suggests that all Up states initiated by the same neuron
result in similar spike sequences.
We then compared SDs before, during, and after the stimula-
tion (for details, see Materials and Methods). We first artificially
generated a template sequence representing an “ideal” sequence
initiated at a specific network site (for example, sequences 101,
102, 100, 103, 99, 104, 98 … for initiation site at 101). We then
computed the SD between this template sequence and every other
sequence generated by the network as a function of time (Fig.
7C). The mean value of SD before stimulation represented base-
line (Fig. 7C, blue dotted line). Because of the random location of
sites of Up-state initiation before stimulation, the SD was signif-
icantly higher (Fig. 7D, p � 0.01) and showed large fluctuations
around the mean (Fig. 7C). The SD was significantly reduced
during stimulation and displayed only minimal fluctuations (Fig.
7C,D). Importantly, we found that the SD remained relatively
lower after stimulation was removed (Fig. 7D), which corrobo-
rates our prediction that the change of synaptic weights during
stimulation promotes specific sequence replay after stimulation.
Finally, we examined sequence replay by a subset of neurons
in which sequences were detected based on the firing rate. We
selected four cortical neurons and assigned them letters (a � 20,
b � 35, c � 50, d � 65) to test repetition of specific letter com-
binations, similar to the previous studies (Ji and Wilson, 2007).

 quences of these neurons were determined by ordering the peaks
of their smoothed firing rate (Fig. 7E, middle; Lee and Wilson,
2002). We then computed the probability of each sequence that
could be formed by four selected neurons (Fig. 7E, bottom) be-
fore, during, and after the stimulation. Before stimulation, initi-
ation of Up states was random, which was reflected in the low
probability of any specific sequence, e.g., “dcba” sequence (Fig.
7E, left column). During stimulation, the pattern of slow oscilla-
tions reflected Up-state propagation from the stimulation site.
The neurons fired sequentially in the direction of Up-state prop-
agation; therefore, the probability of the sequence “dcba” became
high (Fig. 7E, middle column). When stimulation persisted long
enough, we observed that the probability of “dcba” sequence
remained high even after stimulation was removed (Fig. 7E, right
column). This suggests that external input reorganized synaptic
weights to increase the probability of specific firing sequences.
When stimulation was applied at the very different network sites
(e.g., around site 150), the network formed different dominant
sequences (“abcd” and “abdc”) that also remained after the stim-
ulus was removed.
In all of the above simulations, we assumed that memory
traces are initially stored in the hippocampus, and we presented
evidence that the input from the hippocampus to the cortical
network during slow oscillations may govern formation of cor-
responding memory traces in the cortical network. We also tested
the possibility that memory traces are embedded to the cortical
network during the state preceding sleep (e.g., wakefulness), and
we asked the question how these traces would be modified by

 slow oscillations. We found that spike sequences of cortical neu-
rons reflecting those embedded synaptic patterns replayed during
ongoing slow oscillations and that led to further enhancement of
characteristic synaptic patterns (data not shown).
Global (such as transcranial) stimulation augments the effect
of synaptic changes associated with local (such as
hippocampal) input
In our previous simulations, the local input targeted only a few
cortical neurons. This type of input was designed to model the
interaction between the hippocampus and neocortex during
sleep. In the study by Marshall et al. (2006), transcranial electrical
stimulation led to global modulation of the neural membrane
potentials to boost slow oscillations at the early stage of NREM
sleep. To test the effect of such stimulation in our model, we
applied global input (with a frequency of 1 Hz) to the entire
network to modulate slow oscillation. At the same time, we ap-
plied a local stimulation, as described in the previous sections, to
the neurons 101, 102, and 103 to mimic input from the hip-
pocampus. We found that initiation of the Up states was more
likely to occur near the stimulation site when both local and
global stimuli were applied simultaneously (Fig. 8B) compared
with the local stimulation alone (Fig. 8A). Initiation of the Up
states became more synchronized because of the global input
(Fig. 8B, middle top). As a result, synaptic weights increased more
rapidly (Fig. 8, bottom), and after the stimulation, the probability
of Up-state initiation was higher around the stimulation site (Fig.
8, middle bottom) when the global stimulation was coupled with
the local input. These findings suggest that global external stim-
ulation, when co-occurring with the local input (such as normal
projections from hippocampus to the cortex during NREM
sleep), can accelerate synaptic changes associated with sleep-
related memory consolidation, consistent with experimental
results obtained previously (Marshall et al., 2006). In the “closed-
loop” hippocampo-cortical network in vivo, the timing of the
hippocampal SPW-Rs is influenced by the cortical activity, and
those hippocampal events are more likely to occur during transi-
tion from a Down to Up state of slow oscillations (Isomura et al.,
2006; Mo
¨lle et al., 2006). Our study suggests that transcranial
electrical stimulation can enhance synchrony of Up states and
promote sequence activation in the hippocampo-cortex loop.
Discussion
In this study, we showed that the spatiotemporal pattern of sleep
slow oscillations in the neocortex could be influenced by the
sparse synaptic input from the hippocampus. In the presence of
synaptic plasticity, this leads to the input-specific changes in syn-
aptic connections between cortical neurons and formation of a
persistent locus of preferred Up-state initiation at specific cortical
sites. This pattern remains even without hippocampal input,

Wei et al. • Memory Consolidation during Sleep Slow Oscillations
 which manifests consolidation of the memory traces in the neo-
cortex by hippocampal input. Our study thus suggests a putative
neuronal mechanism for memory consolidation during SWS.
Interaction between slow oscillations and synaptic plasticity
Synaptic plasticity is believed to be a cellular mechanism of learn-
ing and information storage in the brain. STDP is an experimen-
tally well-characterized form of plasticity that adjusts synaptic
weights based on the relative timing of the presynaptic and post-
synaptic spikes (Song et al., 2000). Our modeling study supports
the idea that thalamocortical activity during SWS can be well
suited to promote specific and precise synaptic changes by STDP.
We observed mutual interaction between synaptic changes
and spatiotemporal pattern of slow oscillations. First, the pattern
of slow oscillations determined the change of synaptic connec-
tions between cortical neurons. During slow oscillations, the
transition from a Down to Up state of oscillations occurs in a
form of traveling waves (Massimini et al., 2004; Volgushev et al.,
2006), possibly initiated at many independent network locations.
In the presence of STDP, synaptic connections between neurons
changed according to the relative order of spiking: synaptic con-
nections in the direction of wave propagation potentiated, and
those in the opposite direction depressed. Thus, the repetitive
pattern of slow oscillation led to characteristic changes of the
network connectivity.
Second, the changes of synaptic connections can in return
affect pattern of slow oscillations. We found that, after a long
enough period of slow oscillations, the synaptic connectivity ma-
trix of many neurons became strongly asymmetric (inputs from
one direction were higher than those from the opposite direc-
tion). These neurons also had a low probability of excitatory
recurrent connections and were less likely to initiate an Up state.
In contrast, synaptic weights of a few neurons located near stim-
ulation sites exhibited a complex pattern with either high or low
total (net) synaptic weight. The neurons receiving high total syn-
aptic input also had high recurrent connectivity and close to zero
spatial gradient of synaptic weights. These neurons had the high-
est probability for initiating Up states. Our results are consistent
with in vivo finding in cats indicating that the Up states preferen-
tially spread from one or few local foci during slow oscillations
(Volgushev et al., 2006). Previous computational studies also re-
ported that, when STDP was included to the cortical model of Up
and Down states, the network self-organized; strengthening of
connections led to reactivation of precise temporal sequences
(Kang et al., 2008). This study predicts that, within a cortical
architecture, the interaction between slow oscillations and syn-
aptic plasticity may form local clusters of neurons involved to
Up-state initiation, and location of those clusters is altered by
input from other brain areas. These complex synaptic associa-
tions between neurons could potentially contribute to the forma-
tion of assembly sequences for reactivation (O’Neill et al., 2010).
In the model, the global synaptic dynamics leads to bi-
modal distribution in the long term as reported in many stud-
ies of STDP. We implemented a hard boundary (Gerstner et
al., 1996; Kempter et al., 1999; Song et al., 2000; Drew and
Abbott, 2006) in this study to prevent STDP from runaway
synaptic dynamics. Such synaptic dynamics can be potentially
prevented by including heterosynaptic plasticity (Chen et al.,
2013). However, the characteristic changes in synaptic weights
and spatiotemporal dynamics of slow oscillations emerged
early in our simulations and were qualitatively similar for the
rest of the simulation. This suggests that consolidation of
memory and replay of learned sequences does not require
extreme changes in synaptic weights.
Although previous studies have explored the role of STDP
during sleep (Esser et al., 2007; Olcese et al., 2010), these works
mainly focused on the global synaptic weight dynamics (synaptic
homeostasis during sleep). In contrast, our study is focused on
the local synaptic reorganization mediated by the spatiotemporal
pattern of sleep slow oscillations. We found that sleep slow-wave
activity leads to the change of the connectivity between cortical
neurons, and, in return, changes of the synaptic weights affect the
pattern of slow oscillations. Ultimately, our study aims to explain
cortical sequence generation that requires a fine-tuning of spe-
cific connections rather than global scaling of synaptic weights.
The novelty of our research is in linking local synaptic dynamics
to specific patterns of sleep activity and ultimately to sequence
replay.
Interaction between the neocortex and hippocampus to
consolidate memory
It has been proposed that declarative memory is consolidated by
interaction between the hippocampus and neocortex during
sleep, leading to long-term memory storage in the neocortex
(Marshall and Born, 2007; Born, 2010; Schwindel and Mc-
Naughton, 2011). Hippocampal SPW-R events have been hy-
pothesized to provide active communication between the
hippocampus and neocortex during SWS (Buzsa
´ki, 1996). In-
deed, the low cholinergic activation, such as during SWS, permits
information flow from the hippocampus to the neocortex (Has-
selmo, 1999). Several studies supported the hypothesis that
SPW-R events occur mainly in the neocortical transition from
Down to Up states (Battaglia et al., 2004), and suppression of
hippocampal ripple results in poor performance in memory tasks
(Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010). In our study, we have mimicked
hippocampal SPW-R input to the neocortex by sparse external
cortical stimulation. Duration of the stimuli events matched the
typical length of SPW-R events (Sullivan et al., 2011). We have
found that such input promotes Up-state initiation at specific
network locations and induces long-term changes in synaptic
conductances, leading to the sequence replay. These results im-
plicated the importance of the hippocampal SPW-R events in
transferring memory information to the neocortex.
There are evidences suggesting that spindles occur during the
Up states of slow oscillations (Mo
¨lle et al., 2011), and spindles are
temporally aligned with hippocampal ripples (Siapas and Wilson,
1998; Sirota et al., 2003; Staresina et al., 2015). Long-term synap-
tic changes induced by spindles were studied in rat somatosen-
sory layer V pyramidal cells, suggesting that spindles can support
long-term storage of memory-related information in the neo-
cortical networks (Rosanova and Ulrich, 2005). These exper-
imental studies imply that precise coordination of the ripples,
spindles, and slow oscillations plays an important role in
memory consolidation.
Replay of sequences arises from reactivation of
spatiotemporal pattern of slow oscillations
During SWS, the brain reorganizes its synaptic connectivity to
store new information acquired during awake. Some studies have
suggested that the primary effect of sleep is homeostatic down-
regulation of synaptic efficacy (Olcese et al., 2010). Discovery of
replay, a phenomenon when temporally ordered firing sequences
occurred during recent awake are replayed during sleep-
promoting memory consolidation (Ji and Wilson, 2007; Mehta,
2007), suggested a more complex picture of synaptic changes
Wei et al. • Memory Consolidation during Sleep Slow Oscillations

 during sleep. Although some synaptic weights may indeed decay,
others, corresponding to recent awake experience, would en-
hance to form long-term memories. In our model, we observed
sequential firing of neurons during slow oscillations, triggered by
interaction between the input and the intrinsic dynamics of the
thalamocortical network. Although input to the model was lim-
ited by short transient stimulation at one or few cortical sites, our
study predicts that more complex stimulation patterns, such as
representing sequences of firing of hippocampal neurons, would
trigger characteristic responses (firing sequences) in the neocor-
tical network. We found that reorganization of cortical connec-
tivity attributable to STDP increased the likelihood of specific
sequence replay even after hippocampal input was removed. This
suggests a mechanistic explanation for the consolidation of spe-
cific memories during SWS, whereby the memory traces become
independent of the hippocampus and are stored in the neocortex.
Model limitations and future directions
Our simplified one-dimensional thalamocortical model revealed
the basic principles of how interaction between hippocampal
SPW-Rs, cortical slow oscillations, and synaptic plasticity during
sleep may lead to memory-specific synaptic changes, which in
return promote reliable spike sequences. In our model, (1) hip-
pocampal input was limited by one or two cortical sites and
uniquely determined pattern of Up-state propagation, (2) the
spatiotemporal pattern of the Up state then determined the rela-
tive spike timing of neuronal firing within an Up state–cortical
spike sequence, and (3) two nearby cortical initiation sites trig-
gered overlapping but non-identical spike sequences. In a biolog-
ical system, many additional factors may affect spike sequences
during memory replay, including the following: (1) memory-
specific changes of the intracortical connectivity during training
phase in awake; (2) the presence of the plastic long-range intra-
cortical connectivity; and (3) existence of the multiple cortical
input sites for a SPWR event, leading to a complex spatiotempo-
ral pattern of slow oscillation. In such complex settings, the rela-
tionship between hippocampal memory events and cortical spike
sequences can be nonlinear with abrupt change of spike se-
quences as a function of changing hippocampo-cortical input.
Summary
The results of our study present, for the first time, a mechanistic
explanation of how characteristic brain activity during stage 3/4
sleep may promote consolidation of recent declarative memory
events. It makes predictions that can be tested experimentally,
including specific interventions to suppress or augment memory
consolidation processes.
