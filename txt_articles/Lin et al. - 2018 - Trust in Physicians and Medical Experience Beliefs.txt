Context: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) report dissatisfaction with their early
medical care. Little is understood about factors that can encourage stronger patient-provider re-
lationships and promote treatment adherence.
Objective: To compare trust in physicians and beliefs about social support from health care providers
between women with and without PCOS.
Design: Cross-sectional study with online questionnaire.
Setting: Medical clinic referral or broader community recruitment via advertising and websites.
Participants: Three hundred thirty-two US-based women with PCOS or with regular menses (n = 134
and n = 198, respectively).
Main Outcome Measures: Trust and social support toward health care providers [primary care
physicians (PCPs), specialists, and/or nurse practitioners and physician assistants].
Results: PCOS was associated with greater distrust in the PCP’s opinion (P , 0.01) and greater con-
fidence about the PCP’s prioritization of general health concerns (P = 0.04) than the comparison group.
Patients with PCOS felt that the PCP spent less effort and were less qualified to treat PCOS health
concerns than general health concerns (both P , 0.001). No significant associations were observed be-
tween PCOS diagnosis and trust in specialists. When examining social support, women with PCOS felt
they had more arguments with their health care providers than the comparison group (P = 0.02).
Conclusion: Women with PCOS reported greater overall distrust in the PCP’s opinions and more
arguments with their health care providers than women without PCOS. These findings support a need
to identify additional areas of improvement in the patient-provider relationship to ensure continuity of
care for patients with PCOS who require life-long surveillance.

 link with treatment adherence [3, 4], an important consideration when treating polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is characterized by the presence of at least two cardinal
features, which include androgen excess, irregular menstrual cycles, and/or polycystic
ovarian morphology [5]. PCOS is recognized as a leading cause of anovulatory infertility yet
its effects extend well beyond impaired reproductive function. Several metabolic abnor-
malities (such as obesity and increased prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease
and diabetes) are closely associated with PCOS, and lifelong medical care is required to
manage PCOS symptoms and mitigate long-term health complications [6]. As such, patients
with PCOS are encouraged to engage in healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors,
which improve cardinal PCOS symptoms and metabolic status [7–9]. However, women with
PCOS may face unique barriers that impede the adoption of these health-related behaviors
due to their previous medical experiences [10, 11]. The degree to which trust and beliefs about
social support from health care providers contribute to these barriers is uncertain.
There are few data evaluating the patient-provider relationship in PCOS [11, 12]. Among
the studies conducted to date, a substantial proportion of patients with PCOS across several
countries reported feeling frustrated with their early medical experiences [11], resulting in
negative beliefs about medical care [12, 13]. Further, patients’ beliefs about the quality of
medical care appeared to vary between primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists
[12–14]. This observation may be particularly relevant in the United States, where a
gatekeeping approach involving PCPs operates within the health care system for access to
specialist referrals [15, 16]. Indeed, women with PCOS will likely require care from a variety
of health care providers across the life course, due to the evolution of their endocrine and
metabolic symptoms with aging and/or changes in treatment goals at different life stages
[11, 17].
It is also unclear whether medical experiences related to PCOS influence patient beliefs
during treatment of general medical concerns. Previous studies have revealed patients’
beliefs that they received limited informational support provided about specific PCOS issues,
but these studies did not investigate other health concerns that are addressed during patient-
provider interactions [11, 13, 18]. Themes of social support have been only briefly discussed,
leaving this concept largely unexplored in this patient population. To that end, our primary
objective was to examine whether there were differences in trust and beliefs about social
support between women with and without PCOS with types of physicians (i.e., PCP, spe-
cialists) and/or other health care providers (i.e., nurse practitioners, physician assistants).
Our secondary objective was to examine whether trust in physicians varied between the types
of health concerns (i.e., general vs PCOS-related). This study provides context about the
current beliefs about medical care in women with PCOS with the goal of identifying factors,
which could be targeted to improve patients’ overall medical experiences.
1. Materials and Methods
An expanded methods section is available in the Supplemental Materials [19].
A. Participants
This project was registered as part of a larger observational study comparing health-related
behaviors (i.e., diet, physical activity) in women with and without PCOS (ClinicalTrials.gov
no. NCT01859663). Flyers and online advertisements (i.e., Twitter, Facebook, Reddit,
ResearchMatch) were used to recruit locally around Tompkins County, New York, and
broadly across the United States. Participants met inclusion criteria if they reported that
they were between 18 and 38 years of age and had either a history of predictable menstrual
cycles (i.e., between 21 and 35 days) or an existing PCOS diagnosis. A participant was placed
in the PCOS group if they responded affirmatively to the item, “Have you been diagnosed with
PCOS by a medical professional?” Those who never received a PCOS diagnosis and reported
predictable menstrual cycle lengths (i.e., 20 and 35 days) were placed in the comparison

 group. Participants were excluded if they had (1) incomplete surveys (less than half of the
instrument) or reported (2) implausible or missing body mass index (BMI; defined as ,16 kg/m2
or .80 kg/m2), (3) a major chronic disease, (4) a self-reported history of isolated oligomenorrhea
(defined as unpredictable menstrual cycles and/or menstrual cycle length ,20 or .35 days
without a PCOS diagnosis), and/or (5) non-US resident status. The Institutional Review Board
approved the study protocol, and all participants provided informed consent.
B. I-PCOSM Development
The Instrument for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: Medical Experiences (I-PCOSM) was dis-
tributed as a web-based instrument (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) over a 2-year interval (August
2014 to August 2016). Forty-eight items were modified from two published instruments to
assess trust in physicians and beliefs about social support from health care professionals by
women with PCOS [20, 21]. Items were modified with the goal of investigating beliefs related
to medical experiences over a broad range of health care providers (PCP, specialists, nurse
practitioners, and physician assistants) and perceptions of care over general and PCOS-
related health concerns. Examples were provided for specialists, which included but were not
restricted to gynecologists, endocrinologists, and dermatologists. The draft of the instrument
underwent three rounds of peer review by individuals with expertise in instrument design to
ensure clarity and organization of the items prior to administration to research participants.
C. Reliability and Validity of the I-PCOSM
Details about the reliability and validation analyses of the I-PCOSM are described in the
Supplemental Materials [19]. After evaluating validity and reliability, the final instrument
contained 28 reliable and valid items that assessed the recent medical experiences of women
with PCOS within the last 3 years. Items related to trust in physicians were consistently
worded across types of physicians (PCP or specialist) and health concerns (general or PCOS-
related). The PCOS group was presented with items on both types of health concerns,
whereas the comparison group was only asked about general health issues. Responses to each
item were formatted as five-point scales. Response options for trust in physicians ranged from
“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree,” whereas the options on social support ranged from
“never” to “always.” For all responses, we chose a midpoint of 3 to reflect neutrality. Thus,
any score greater than 3.5 reflected greater agreement and/or greater frequency due to
rounding principles.
D. Statistical Analysis for Primary Analyses
Data were analyzed with SPSS 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY), and a P , 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Demographic and anthropometric data were compared between
PCOS and comparison groups using independent t tests and x2 analyses. To address the
primary objective, multiple linear regression was used to examine associations between
PCOS diagnosis (independent variable) with trust and social support outcomes. Mixed-effects
regression models were used to investigate whether trust of physicians differed between
types of health concerns. Given that each participant in the PCOS group had two observations
(PCOS and other health concerns) for this secondary objective, participants were treated as a
random effect in the mixed model. All regression models were adjusted for age (continuous),
BMI (categorical), and income (categorical). As a result of the high correlation among trust
and social support items, multiple comparison correction methods were not used in the
analyses [20].
2. Results
Of the 755 women that completed the I-PCOSM in the nationwide sample, 332 (44%) met
eligibility criteria for the PCOS (n = 134) and the comparison groups (n = 198). The remaining

 participants (n = 423) were excluded based on incomplete surveys (n = 312), report of oli-
gomenorrhea without a PCOS diagnosis (n = 80), non-US resident status (n = 30), and/or
implausible or missing BMI values (n = 1). The eligible study sample included 262 (79%)
white participants and 188 (57%) participants with a college degree (Table 1). Most women
were New York state residents (62%), with the remaining participants residing at different
areas in the United States. Groups did not differ by age, race, education, or BMI. By contrast,
the PCOS group reported higher yearly household incomes relative to the comparison group
(P , 0.001).
Women with PCOS believed their physicians (both PCPs and specialists) were well
qualified to treat general health concerns and were able to place patients’ medical needs
above other considerations (Table 2). Overall, the PCOS group had positive beliefs regarding
the physicians’ efforts to treat their general health concerns. Although women with PCOS
somewhat disagreed with the statement, “I sometimes distrust the recent specialized doctor’s
opinions and would like a second one” [2.5 (SD 1.2)], they had more neutral attitudes toward
the PCP [3.1 (SD 1.2)]. Relative to the comparison group in the fully adjusted models
(Table 3), women with PCOS experienced greater distrust in the opinions offered by the PCP
(P , 0.01) but reported greater confidence in the PCP’s prioritization of their general medical
needs (P = 0.04). Although PCOS was also positively associated with patient’s trust in the
PCP’s qualifications to treat general medical problems in the unadjusted model (P = 0.03),
this association became nonsignificant after adjusting for covariates (P = 0.05). No significant
associations were observed between PCOS status and trust in specialists.

 Women with PCOS provided favorable scores when asked about their trust in specialists
regarding PCOS-related concerns (Table 2). Similar to responses about general health
concerns, women with PCOS agreed that the PCPs were able to prioritize PCOS medical
needs [3.8 (SD 1.1)] but had more neutral feelings about their PCP’s qualifications to treat
PCOS [3.4 (SD 1.4)]. The PCOS group’s responses to items relating to the PCPs efforts to treat
and advise on PCOS concerns suggested they experienced more neutral feelings regarding
their interactions with their PCP on these issues [3.4 (SD 1.4) and 3.2 (SD 1.2)]. Results from
the mixed model confirmed that the PCOS group felt their PCP placed less effort in treating

 PCOS issues compared with general health concerns (Table 3, P , 0.001). Moreover, women
with PCOS were less likely to believe that their PCP was well qualified to treat PCOS
concerns relative to general health concerns (P , 0.001). The adjustment for potential
covariates did not appreciably alter the estimates of these associations.
The PCOS group reported that they usually received general health advice (informational
support) from health care providers but only sometimes receive specific information about
nutrition and PCOS (Table 2). Women with PCOS reported that they rarely had negative
encounters with their health care providers, yet only sometimes felt satisfied with the
emotional support provided during their medical care. The limited satisfaction may be at-
tributed to the patients’ inability to usually relax and discuss their health concerns with their
health care providers (3.1 6 1.2 and 3.3 6 1.2, respectively), as well as the patients’ beliefs
that health care providers only sometimes comprehended their health concerns (3.4 6 1.1).
When examining differences in beliefs about social support by mixed models, the PCOS group
reported that their health care providers were more inclined to argue with them about health-
related issues relative to the comparison group (Table 3, P = 0.02).
3. Discussion
To our knowledge, this was the first study to directly investigate the trust and beliefs about
social support with health care providers in a sample of women with PCOS. Our data support
the conclusion that women with PCOS believe that their PCPs are well qualified to treat
general health concerns but are less qualified to address issues related to PCOS. Accordingly,
PCOS was associated with greater distrust of the PCP’s opinions to treat PCOS concerns, but
this association was not observed with specialists. Women with PCOS were only some-
what satisfied with the provision of emotional support experienced during medical visits
with providers in general and felt they had more arguments with their health care pro-
viders about their health issues compared with the comparison group. Collectively, the
evidence implicates the contribution of PCOS diagnoses on specific domains in the patient-
provider relationship.

 Differences in trust between study groups emerged only when medical experiences with
PCPs were evaluated, suggesting that patients’ trust may differ between PCP and specialists.
We hypothesize that PCPs face greater feelings of distrust because they are at the front line of
health care delivery [15] and frequently provide referrals when encountering medical con-
ditions outside their usual scope of practice [22]. However, the absence of significant asso-
ciations between PCOS and trust related to specialists should not be interpreted to mean that
all types of specialized care are associated with stronger trust in these domains. The
I-PCOSM did not distinguish patient experiences by physician subspecialty, leaving this as
an important area of future research. The need for more research in this area was emphasized
by recent findings of varying levels of knowledge between reproductive endocrinologists and
gynecologists [23] and the substantial lag period between PCOS symptom onset and di-
agnosis by multiple health care providers [11].
This study showed that women with PCOS only sometimes received information about
PCOS, per se, and beneficial dietary and physical activity behaviors, which is consistent with
previous findings that patients with PCOS are provided with limited information from their
health care providers [11–13, 18]. Further, we also noted that women with PCOS were only
sometimes satisfied with the emotional support provided by their health care providers,
which was closely linked to poor beliefs about receiving encouragement about their health.
Among the few qualitative studies that have examined the concept of emotional support,
interviews revealed that women with PCOS perceived a lack of empathy and experienced
greater frequency of arguments with their physicians [12, 14]. Tomlinson et al. [12] identified
conflicts stemming from disagreements about whether PCOS symptoms would alleviate with
age and on the necessity of specialist referrals. Our demonstration that PCOS was associated
with greater arguments about health-related issues relative to the comparison group sup-
ports these earlier findings. Collectively, results across studies reveal the health care pro-
vider should address different aspects of social support (informational and emotional) to
improve the PCOS patient-provider relationship.
Strengths of this study include the systematic approach used to develop and ensure the
validity and reliability of the I-PCOSM in a large study sample. Further, the main effect of
PCOS on trust and social support toward health care providers was investigated after
adjusting for several potential covariates (i.e., age, BMI, income) to better reflect an ap-
proximation of the actual effect sizes between exposure and outcome variables.
We acknowledge that this study relied on participants’ self-report of having a PCOS di-
agnosis by a medical professional, and hence, it is possible that women who reported being told
that they have PCOS may not actually have the condition. However, there is evidence to
support that self-reported PCOS correlates well with the clinical manifestations of the condition
[24], and this approach has been used in many survey-based studies [11, 25]. Further, women
who self-report having a formal diagnosis of PCOS will likely “self-identify” with that condition,
thus influencing health-related behaviors [26]. Our decision to exclude women with oligo-
menorrhea with no known PCOS diagnosis from the comparison group was intended to enable a
comparison of women with the highest likelihood of having PCOS (per self-report) vs women
with the lowest likelihood of having (or self-identifying) with PCOS. By applying these ap-
proaches, we attempted to reduce the heterogeneity within each study group.
We acknowledge that this study was limited by the possibility of self-selection bias
particularly by those with Internet access and interest in study participation. We also did not
exclude for the presence of other physical or psychiatric disorders that might be important
determinants of trust in health care providers. Further, previous research has shown that
patients who were most satisfied with their medical care were often the first to respond to
surveys, but that evaluations became less affirmative through repeated prompting of initial
nonresponders [27]. This study did not use repeated prompts to ensure participants com-
pleted the survey, so it is possible that our survey primarily captured responses from in-
dividuals with more positive outlooks about their medical care. Compared with a study with
an unselected population [28], a greater percentage of women with PCOS in our study
identified as white. This suggests that we may not have captured a representative sample of

 US women with PCOS and reduces the generalizability of the results to other racial and
ethnic groups. There is some evidence that black women are less trusting of physicians than
white women and more concerned about potential for harm in hospital settings [29]. For these
reasons, future research would benefit from evaluating health-related beliefs across a more
diverse spectrum of patients with PCOS.
This study provides new evidence regarding the trust and beliefs about medical care in the
PCOS patient population and identified potential areas of improvement to enhance patient-
provider relationships. Though delays in the diagnosis can be partly attributed to contro-
versies with the PCOS diagnostic criteria [30], negative medical experiences can ultimately
lead to feelings of greater dissatisfaction with health care providers [11]. When interacting
with a patient seeking answers about PCOS, we suggest that physicians consider tailoring
their advice to acknowledge the unique challenges and concerns of women living with PCOS
and listen to the patients without judgment. Providing strong informational and emotional
support may help reduce feelings of distrust between patients and physicians. We also
recommend the importance of strengthening the specialty referral process and identifying
patient cues for when a referral may be the optimal approach when diagnosing and/or
treating women at risk for PCOS [11, 22]. Future studies should investigate and establish
recommendations to improve the medical experiences of women with PCOS. Efforts to di-
rectly compare experiences by subspecialty and how the PCOS diagnosis experience in-
fluences impressions of general medical care are needed. By investigating these questions,
the far-reaching implications of PCOS medical experiences could be further understood with
the goal of ensuring quality and continuity of care for patients who require life-long sur-
veillance to curb health risks related to PCOS.
