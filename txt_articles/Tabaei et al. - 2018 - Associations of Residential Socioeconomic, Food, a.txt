In the present study, we examined the longitudinal associations between residential environmental factors and glyce-
mic control in 182,756 adults with diabetes in New York City from 2007 to 2013. Glycemic control was defined as a
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level less than 7%. We constructed residential-level measures and performed principle com-
ponent analysis to formulate a residential composite score. On the basis of this score, we divided residential areas into
quintiles, with the lowest and highest quintiles reflecting the least and most advantaged residential environments, re-
spectively. Several residential-level environmental characteristics, including more advantaged socioeconomic condi-
tions, greater ratio of healthy food outlets to unhealthy food outlets, and residential walkability were associated with
increased glycemic control. Individuals who lived continuously in the most advantaged residential areas took less time
to achieve glycemic control compared with the individuals who lived continuously in the least advantaged residential
areas (9.9 vs. 11.5 months). Moving from less advantaged residential areas to more advantaged residential areas was
related to improved diabetes control (decrease in HbA1c = 0.40%, 95% confidence interval: 0.22, 0.55), whereas mov-
ing from more advantaged residential areas to less advantaged residential areas was related to worsening diabetes
control (increase in HbA1c = 0.33%, 95% confidence interval: 0.24, 0.44). These results show that residential areas
with greater resources to support healthy food and residential walkability are associated with improved glycemic control
in persons with diabetes.

In several epidemiologic studies, investigators have exam-
ined residential environments and related health outcomes,
and there is evidence that better access to high-quality resi-
dential resources is associated with better health, as well as
decreased disease prevalence and incidence (1–5). Results
from these studies suggest that modifying residential envir-
onments may improve population health and reduce health
disparities by increasing health behaviors and minimizing
unhealthy exposures (2, 6).
Research has explored this concept (7–9), and several
mechanisms for this relationship have been proposed (10).
Residential socioeconomic disadvantage, as measured by
household income, poverty level and racial composition,
has been found to be associated with higher body mass index
(BMI) (11–13), cardiovascular disease (10), and hypertension
(11), which are independent of individual-level characteristics.
Regarding food environment, several studies have found
that greater residential availability of healthy food options
is associated with healthier diet (5, 14, 15) and lower obesity
(11, 16–19), whereas higher density of outlets selling poorer
quality foods (e.g., fast food restaurants and small grocery
stores) is associated with increased weight (11, 13). With respect
to the built environment, residential walkability and high density
of mixed residential and commercial units has been associ-
ated with higher levels of walking (20–23) and decreased
weight (16, 24); access to parks and recreational facilities
has also been associated with higher levels of physical activity
(25–28).

 Research on the influence of the residential environment on
persons with diabetes mellitus is limited. A small amount of
cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence exist that show that
residential socioeconomic status, as well as availability of
healthy food, physical activity resources, and walking environ-
ments, have statistically significant associations with the inci-
dence and prevalence of diabetes (2, 23). It is unclear, however,
whether residential environments directly contribute to diabetes
control in persons with diabetes. To our knowledge, no study
has prospectively evaluated whether the cumulative number of
exposures to specific residential features is associated with gly-
cemic control in persons with diabetes in a large multiracial,
multiethnic cohort.
The present study was conducted to determine whether
residential-level socioeconomic, food, and built environment
factors were associated with glycemic control in a population
of adults with diabetes in New York City (NYC) over a 7-year
period. We hypothesized that residential resources that sup-
ported high-quality environments would be associated with
better glycemic control, as measured by hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c). Specifically, we aimed to assess: 1) associations
between residential-level environmental factors and glycemic
control; 2) associations between residential-level environmen-
tal factors on achievement of, and failure to maintain glycemic
control; 3) residential stability and longitudinal influence of
continuously living in 1 residential area on glycemic control;
and 4) residential mobility and the longitudinal influence of
moving between residential areas on glycemic control.
METHODS
Study population
We utilized data from the NYC HbA1c Registry (referred to
here as the Registry) (29). In 2006, the NYC Department of
Health and Mental Hygiene implemented mandatory report-
ing of HbA1c tests to the Registry from NYC residents, which
enabled public health surveillance of diabetes trends in the
area. The Registry has limited data accompanying HbA1c test
results (e.g., demographic information) and does not include
any clinical history to confirm diabetes diagnosis. Consistent
with the diagnostic criteria of the American Diabetes Associa-
tion (30), we defined diabetes as the reporting of at least 2
HbA1c tests with a value of 6.5% or greater since the incep-
tion of the Registry.
The study included NYC residents aged 18 years or older
with diabetes who reported at least 1 HbA1c test every year
in the Registry between January 1, 2007, and December 31,
2013. Each study aim examined a different registrant cohort.
Aim 1 and aim 2 included all persons who had at least 1 HbA1c
test every year between 2007–2009 (defined as time 1 period)
and who stayed in their place of residence throughout the
3-year time 1 period. Aim 3, which measured residential stabil-
ity, examined persons included in aim 1 and aim 2 who stayed
in their original place of residence after the end of time 1 period
and who had yearly testing throughout a 4-year time 2 period
(2010–2013). Aim 4, which measured residential mobility,
examined persons included in aim 1 and aim 2 who moved
to and stayed in a new residential area after the end of time
1 period and who had yearly testing throughout the 4-year
time 2 period. The comparison group for residential mobil-
ity was the cohort examined for aim 3.
Variables
For aim 1 and aim 2, the primary outcome was glycemic con-
trol, defined by the American Diabetes Association’s guidelines
(30) as an HbA1c level less than 7% across all HbA1c tests. As
a sensitivity analysis, we examined a less stringent glyce-
mic control target (HbA1c <8%). For aims 3 and 4, the out-
come of interest was mean HbA1c value across all HbA1c
tests for the period of interest. The residential-level measures
processed for the current study was guided by previous litera-
ture and has been described extensively (16, 31–33). A detailed
description is provided in the Web Appendix 1 (available at
https://academic.oup.com/aje). Briefly, we defined residential
areas by zip code (n = 164), and constructed 16 residential-
level measures by combining several proprietary and public use
geo-spatial data sets and included measures of socioeconomic,
food, and built environments. These measures were then matched
to data from the Registry using a unique individual zip code fea-
ture key identification. Socioeconomic environment variables
were constructed using data from the 2000 US Census summary
file 3 (34), which include race/ethnic composition, median
household income, education attainment, area-based neigh-
borhood poverty level, proportion of population who are lin-
guistically isolated, and homicide crime. Food environment
measures were derived from 2005 data purchased from Dun &
Bradstreet (Short Hills, New Jersey), which include business
name, geocoded location, and detailed Standard Industrial Clas-
sification industry codes for food establishments. As described
previously (16), we first identified types of food outlets by Stan-
dard Industrial Classification code numbers and business name
searches, and then grouped them into categories that were
hypothesized to provide BMI-healthy or BMI-unhealthy food,
with a neutral category for outlets whose classification was
uncertain. Built environment variables constructed for the
present study included a measure of residential walkability
(a co-distribution of residential and commercial land use mix)
using the 2005 Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (35), a
parcel-level data set available from the NYC Department
of City Planning. Other built environment measures included
proportion of park and green space area, as well as proportion
of outdoor open space and recreational areas per zip code,
determined by using the 2006 data from the NYC Department
of Parks and Recreation boundary shapefile and the NYC
Department of City Planning. Individual-level variables included
age at baseline (age at the first HbA1c test in 2007), sex, frequency
of HbA1c testing, duration of follow-up (months) and average
time interval between HbA1c testing (months).
Statistical approach
To aid in interpreting the magnitude of associations and to
allow for comparison of relative changes that were associated
with a 1 standard deviation increase, the results were examined
as transformed residential variables using standardized z scores.
Therefore, changes of continuous independent variables were
measured as 1-unit offsets from the standard deviation.

 Correlation analyses were performed for all residential-level
environmental variables to measure the strength and direction
of a linear relationship between these variables. As is often
found with census data, several of these variables were highly
and significantly correlated (Web Table 1). Given the high
degree of correlation amongst residential-level environmental
variables, and considering the problem of multicollinearity that
would result from analyzing these measures simultaneously in
multivariate models, we performed principle component analy-
sis. In total, 3 factors extracted in the principle component anal-
ysis explained 82% of the variation in the data. Factor 1
represented a mix of residential socioeconomic and BMI-
unhealthy food variables, whereas factor 2 reflected residen-
tial social variables, and factor 3 represented availability and
accessibility of BMI-healthy and BMI-neutral food outlets, as
well as residential walkability (Web Table 2). These factors
were not significantly correlated with one another (for factor 1
vs. factor 2, correlation coefficient = 0.03, P = 0.70; for factor
1 vs. factor 3, correlation coefficient = 0.09, P = 0.26; for fac-
tor 2 vs. factor 3, correlation coefficient = 0.13, P = 0.10).
Because a high score for both factor 1 and factor 2 reflected
residential disadvantage and a high score for factor 3 reflected
residential advantage, factor 1 and factor 2 were rescaled accord-
ingly such that a high score represented a more advantaged resi-
dential environment. We then combined the components of the
significant factors to formulate a residential composite score (an
overall measure of residential environment) by summing the
variable scores within each factor and then across factors. On
the basis of this composite score, we divided residential areas
into quintiles. The first (lowest) quintile reflects the least advan-
taged residential environments and the fifth (highest) reflects
the most advantaged environments.
In the present study, a multilevel mixed modeling framework
with the following hierarchical structure was applied: longitudi-
nal repeated HbA1c measurements (level 1) were nested within
individuals (level 2), which were nested within residential areas
(level 3). Specifically, generalized linear mixed models with a
binary distribution for residual errors and logit link function
were used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals
to assess the associations between residential-level environmen-
tal factors and glycemic control (aim 1). The intra-cluster corre-
lation coefficient derived from the model was used to assess the
variance within and between residential areas. Conditional Cox
proportional hazards models with robust sandwich estimates of
the covariance matrix were used to conduct time-to-event anal-
ysis and estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals to
assess the association between residential-level environmental
factors and achievement of glycemic control (aim 2). Time-
to-event analysis was conducted in 2 ways: 1) time to achieve
glycemic control for individuals with HbA1c 7% or greater at
baseline (first HbA1c test in 2007), and 2) time to failure to
maintain glycemic control for individuals with HbA1c less
than 7% at baseline. As individuals had many repeated HbA1c
measurements at different time points (initial and all subsequent
HbA1c tests), we assumed that the hazard varied as a function
of time since the individual’s last event. Finally, random coeffi-
cient linear mixed models with continuous outcomes and random
intercept and slope (time) were used to examine 1) residential
stability and changes in mean HbA1c values for individuals
who stayed in their original residential areas (aim 3), and
2) residential mobility comparing positive and negative change
in mean HbA1c slope between individuals who moved from 1
residential area to another across the residential environment
composite score (aim 4).
The multivariate models were further adjusted for age, sex,
frequency of HbA1c testing, duration of follow-up (months),
average time interval between HbA1c testing (months) and zip-
code level number of total population. The fitness of models
and their covariance structure were assessed using −2 Log like-
lihood test, as well as Akaike’s and Bayesian information crite-
rion statistics. We evaluated the proportional hazard assumption
of Cox models by plotting Schoenfeld residuals against time.
Descriptive statistics were generated using mean (standard devi-
ation) and median (25%–75% interquartile range) for continu-
ous variables and proportions for categorical variables. All
statistical tests were 2-sided, with a threshold for significance of
P < 0.05. All descriptive and comparative analyses were con-
ducted using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North
Carolina). The research protocol of the present study was re-
viewed and approved by the NYC Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene institutional review board.
RESULTS
Description of residential areas
In the present study, the least advantaged residential areas (first
quintile of the residential environment composite score) were
found to be more likely to have a larger number of residents,
higher proportion of racial and ethnic minorities, and higher
proportion of socioeconomic disadvantage compared with the
most advantaged (fifth quintile) residential areas (Table 1). Com-
pared with the most advantaged areas, the least advantaged areas
also had lower land-use mix, residential walkability, and num-
bers of healthy and neutral food outlets. There were no statisti-
cally significant differences between the 2 types of residential
areas with regard to the number of unhealthy food outlets, per-
centage of residential area parks and green space, and propor-
tion of outdoor recreational resources.
Demographic characteristics of individuals
The 182,756 adults included in the study had a mean age of
64 years and a mean HbA1c of 7.7%. The median number of
HbA1c tests over the 3-year period was 6 and the median average
time interval between HbA1c tests was 4.3 months (Table 2).
Associations between residential environments and
glycemic control
Age, sex, socioeconomic environment variables (all except
linguistic isolation), BMI-healthy, neutral and unhealthy food
environment ratios, and residential walkability were signifi-
cantly associated with glycemic control (Table 3). In the mul-
tivariate analysis, all 3 residential environment factor scores
independently (odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% confidence inter-
val (CI): 1.28, 1.33; OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.38, 1.42; OR = 1.08,
95% CI: 1.06, 1.11) and the summary residential environment
composite score (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.54, 1.61) were signifi-
cantly associated with glycemic control. The odds of glycemic

b Social environment variables were constructed at the zip-code level using US Census data from the year 2000. All 2000 US Census variables
were calculated using variables of sample data from summary file 3 (34). Homicide variables were mined from the New York Times (51).
c Food environment measures were derived from 2005 data purchased from Dun & Bradstreet, a commercial vendor of business data. Dun &
Bradstreet maintains a comprehensive database of microdata on over 11 million US business locations, which include business name, geocoded
location, and detailed Standard Industrial Classification industry codes for food establishments (52). Food outlets for BMI-healthy, BMI-neutral, and
BMI-unhealthy were measured using point-in polygons counts.
d Built environment variables constructed for the present study included a measure of residential and commercial land use mix using the Primary
Land Use Tax Lot Output data (35), the percentage of open space and outdoor recreational area available from the Department of City Planning,
and the percentage of park and green space area available from NYC Department of Parks and Recreation park boundary shapefile data (53).
e Residential environment factor score 1 is a summary score extracted from principal component analysis of the variables low proportion of His-
panic population, poverty, linguistically isolated, less than high school education, ratio of counts of BMI-unhealthy food to BMI-healthy and BMI-
neutral food outlets, high proportion of neighborhood income, and college education. This score explained 47.9% of the variation of the original
neighborhood variables.
f Residential environment factor score 2 is a summary score extracted from principal component analysis of the variables low proportion of black
population, homicide crime; and high proportion of white population. This score explained 22.9% of the variation of the original neighborhood
variables.
g Residential environment factor score 3 is a summary score extracted from principal component analysis of the variables ratio of BMI-healthy
food to BMI-neutral and BMI-unhealthy food outlets, ratio of BMI-neutral food to BMI-healthy and BMI-unhealthy food outlets and neighborhood
walkability. This score explained 11.0% of the variation of the original neighborhood variables.
h A residential socioeconomic, food and built environment composite score was created by combining the 3 components identified by principal
component analysis and then divided into quintiles. This score explain a substantial amount of the variation (81.8%) of the original neighborhood
variables.

 control in the most advantaged residential areas was 2.59 times
higher than in the least advantaged residential areas (95% CI:
2.43, 2.77). The intra-residential correlation coefficient was 0.02.
Table 4 shows the time-to-event analyses by residential
environment composite score quintiles. The result indicates
that among individuals with a first HbA1c test of 7% or greater,
living in the most advantaged residential areas was associated
with a shorter time to achieving glycemic control compared
with living in the least advantaged areas (9.9 months (95% CI:
9.6, 10.1) vs. 11.5 months (95% CI: 11.4, 11.7); hazard ratio =
1.14, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.16). Among individuals with a first
HbA1c test of less than 7%, living in the most advantaged resi-
dential areas was associated with a longer time to failure to
maintain glycemic control compared with individuals who
lived in the least advantaged areas (10.9 months (95% CI:
10.7, 11.1) vs. 9.7 months (95% CI: 9.6, 9.9); hazard ratio =
0.87, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.89).
Residential stability
Table 5 illustrates trajectories of mean HbA1c by residen-
tial environment composite score quintiles for individuals
who stayed in their place of residence between 2007 and
2013. The intercept of mean HbA1c in the most advantaged
residential areas was 0.44% lower than in the least advan-
taged areas (P < 0.001). Overall, the slope of mean HbA1c
was fairly stable across all residential environment compos-
ite score quintiles over the 7-year study period, and ranged
from clinically insignificant 0.13% in the least advantaged
residential areas to −0.01% in the most advantaged areas. These
results suggest that individuals who lived continuously in more
advantaged residential areas had persistently lower mean
HbA1c values and better diabetes control compared with the
individuals who lived continuously in less advantaged resi-
dential areas.

 increase in residential environment composite score; P <
0.001). From the baseline condition of no change in score, mean
HbA1c decreased by 0.16% per each 1-unit positive change in
score (score >0; P < 0.001). This implies that change in resi-
dence to an area with a higher residential environment score is
significantly associated with a 0.40% decrease in HbA1c values
(95% CI: 0.22, 0.55). Conversely, compared with the baseline
condition of no change in residential environment score, mean
HbA1c increased by 0.11% per 1-unit decrease in score (score
<0; P < 0.001). These results suggest that change in residence
to an area with a poorer residential environment score is signifi-
cantly associated with a 0.33% increase in HbA1c values (95%
CI: 0.24, 0.44).
As a sensitivity analysis, we examined a less stringent
HbA1c goal for glycemic control as defined by HbA1c less
than 8%. Overall, the sensitivity analysis mirrored the origi-
nal findings, in which some higher overall magnitudes of the
associations were found (Web Tables 3 and 4).
DISCUSSION
The present study identified several residential-level socioeco-
nomic, food, and built environment factors that were associated
with glycemic control (HbA1c <7.0% and <8.0%) after adjust-
ment for other residential environment and individual-level

 covariates. These findings suggest that residential character-
istics such as more advantaged socioeconomic conditions,
greater ratio of healthy and neutral food outlets compared
with unhealthy food outlets, and residential walkability were
positively associated with glycemic control. Conversely, less
advantaged socioeconomic conditions, homicide crime, and a
greater ratio of unhealthy food outlets compared with healthy
and neutral food outlets were negatively associated with gly-
cemic control.
We found that individuals who lived continuously in more
advantaged residential areas with high-quality environmental
resources had persistently lower mean HbA1c values and bet-
ter diabetes control compared with the individuals who lived
continuously in less advantaged residential areas with low-
quality environment resources. Moving from less advantaged
to more advantaged residential areas was related to better dia-
betes control as measured by lower HbA1c levels, whereas
moving from more advantaged to less advantaged residential
areas was related to poorer diabetes control and higher HbA1c
levels during a 4-year study period (time 2). The change in
HbA1c in the present study compares favorably to monother-
apy with several approved pharmacologic anti-glycemic agents
to treat type 2 diabetes (36, 37).
Relatively little is known about the environmental determi-
nants of diabetes. Several cross-sectional studies have found
relationship between diabetes prevalence and residential food
(8), and social (38, 39) environment resources. Only a few lon-
gitudinal studies have shown direct associations between resi-
dential environments and diabetes prevalence or incidence.
Poor housing (40) and living in socioeconomically less advan-
taged residential areas (41, 42) have been reported to be posi-
tively associated with diabetes onset, even among those with
higher individual income and socioeconomic status. To our
knowledge, 2 studies found that longitudinal exposure to resi-
dential environments with greater resources for physical activ-
ity and healthy foods was associated with lower incidence of
type 2 diabetes (43, 44). One randomized social experiment
study showed that changing residential environments (from
high to low poverty) led to a reduced prevalence of obesity
and type 2 diabetes (45). The group with a randomly assigned
opportunity to move to a residential area with a lower poverty
rate had 4.3% lower prevalence of diabetes compared with the
control group. Additionally, 2 recent studies found a negative
association between walkability and type 2 diabetes that were
adjusted for neighborhood deprivation (46), and area income
and ethnicity (47). A recent cross-sectional study has shown a
positive relationship of neighborhood characteristic such as
aesthetics, social support and access to healthy food, and self-
care behaviors with glycemic control among individuals with
diabetes (48). However, that study did not use direct measure-
ments of residential environment; and instead evaluated the
participant’s perception of their neighborhood, and used self-
reported scales and indices to measure neighborhood charac-
teristics. To date, we are aware of no other studies that have
directly examined the environmental determinants of dia-
betes control.
The present study has several limitations. First, residential
self-selection may bias the associations reported, in which indivi-
duals with certain behaviors select to live in certain residential
areas. Because the Registry has limited individual-level variables,
we were not able to adjust for any other important individual-
level variables related to residential selection beside age and
sex, so unobserved individual characteristics may have influ-
enced our results. Second, zip codes were used as the spatial
scale for this analysis, which is an administrative unit that cre-
ates artificial boundaries that may not be optimal. Thus, the in-
fluences of residential resources on diabetes control may not
be fully apparent using this analytical unit. Third, there may
be potential sources of error and misclassification in the mea-
sures of food environment. Data from Dun & Bradstreet are
used mainly for marketing purposes, so coverage may be less
complete in areas that are less attractive to marketers. We con-
trolled for residential socioeconomic composition, which may
be an important correlate of measurement error in the Dun &
Bradstreet data (16). Another issue is the possibility of misclas-
sification of food outlets into the BMI-healthy, BMI-unhealthy,
and BMI-neutral categories. Within-category heterogeneity in
food selection may bias food environment coefficients toward
zero or create interactions between residential composition and
food environment characteristics (16). Although the analyses
controlled for variables that might influence the level of within-
category measurement error such as residential social composi-
tion and land-use mix, measurement error remains a possibility.
Another limitation is the temporal mismatch between the time
periods of the study (2007–2013), food environment measures
and land use data (2005), population census measures (2000),
and crime data (2006). Because residential demographic and
built environment characteristics typically change slowly,
these discrepancies should not affect the results significantly.
Although we only looked at the residential areas for the pres-
ent analysis, it is also possible that the working environments
of individuals may affect the observed associations in the pres-
ent study. In addition, we did not adjust for any time-varying
covariates which could affect the analysis. Finally, as our
study was based on a multi-racial and ethnic urban population,
these results may not be generalizable to rural and more racially
and ethnically homogenous settings.
A primary strength of the present study is the longitudinal
measurement of residential environment and glycemic control
status over a 7-year period in a large, multi-racial, multi-ethnic
sample. We examined multiple measures within each socio-
economic, food, and built environmental feature directly and
concurrently, rather than using 1 residential characteristic as a
proxy for many interrelated features, which has been the case
in most of the current research to date. This approach may be
less susceptible to possible problems of endogeneity or reverse
causation (49), in which the compositional characteristics of
residential areas are determined by the individual characteristics
of the residents (50). The examination of mutual and relative
synergistic influence of several residential environment features
is another key strength. Most studies have treated physical and
social domains of residential areas as independent, but these
features are interrelated and may have a combined influence on
health (2). Future research is needed to understand the mutual
implication of different residential environments. Use of com-
prehensive measures to characterize the food environment into
BMI-healthy, BMI-unhealthy and BMI-neutral categories is a
third strength. Although this method limits our ability to mea-
sure the association between specific food outlets and glycemic
control, it provides a more accurate and complete account of

 food choices available to urban residents (14, 16). When only 1
food environment type is studied, the results are difficult to
interpret, as residential areas with greater access to unhealthy
food options may also have greater access to healthy food op-
tions (14).
In conclusion, the present analysis found an association
between socioeconomic, food and built environments, and
glycemic control. These results are consistent with the hypoth-
esis that residential areas with greater resources to support
healthy food, residential walkability and high socioeconomic
environments are positively associated with glycemic control
in persons with diabetes. Further research is needed to increase
the confidence of the associations observed in the present
study, especially by adjusting for time-varying individual- and
residential-level environmental resources, as such findings
have important implications for urban policy and population
health improvement efforts. Research on other environmental
exposures and factors, such as those near work and health care
access environment attributes, may also be appropriate.
