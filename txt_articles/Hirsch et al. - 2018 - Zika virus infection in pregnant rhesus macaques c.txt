Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy leads to an increased risk of fetal growth
restriction and fetal central nervous system malformations, which are outcomes broadly
referred to as the Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). Here we infect pregnant rhesus maca-
ques and investigate the impact of persistent ZIKV infection on uteroplacental pathology,
blood flow, and fetal growth and development. Despite seemingly normal fetal growth and
persistent fetal-placenta-maternal infection, advanced non-invasive in vivo imaging studies
reveal dramatic effects on placental oxygen reserve accompanied by significantly decreased
oxygen permeability of the placental villi. The observation of abnormal oxygen transport
within the placenta appears to be a consequence of uterine vasculitis and placental villous
damage in ZIKV cases. In addition, we demonstrate a robust maternal-placental-fetal
inflammatory response following ZIKV infection. This animal model reveals a potential
relationship between ZIKV infection and uteroplacental pathology that appears to affect
oxygen delivery to the fetus during development.

n general, both transplacental passage of maternal viral
infections and subsequent fetal infection are rare1. When
maternal viral infection does occur, it leads to productive viral
replication in the placenta and a fetal inflammatory response that
can have deleterious outcomes, even though the virus is not
always detected in the fetus1. Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-
borne flavivirus closely related to yellow fever and dengue viruses,
recently caused an epidemic in the Americas2. Historically, ZIKV
infections have been sporadic and associated with relatively mild
disease. However, clinical observations of the recent epidemic
indicate that ZIKV may cause neurological sequelae in adults,
such as Guillain–Barré Syndrome as well as a spectrum of neu-
rological birth defects in infected fetuses, including microcephaly,
eye defects and hearing loss3,4. While initial reports from the
WHO and CDC highlighted microcephaly as the major concern
with vertical transmission of ZIKV infection in pregnancy, newer
studies refer to Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS), of which
microcephaly is one severe manifestation of infection. The data
from a cohort of >1000 pregnant women with possible ZIKV
infection indicated that ~5% of the resultant neonates had evi-
dence of birth defects, and this proportion was ~10% if restricted
to cases with confirmed evidence of ZIKV infection5. Within the
spectrum of anomalies of CZS, there are a range of adverse
obstetric outcomes, which occur in the absence of severe neonatal
CNS deficits6,7. Viral infections during pregnancy have been
demonstrated to cause spontaneous abortions, stillbirth, fetal
infection,
intrauterine
growth
restriction
(IUGR),
oligohy-
dramnios, preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm
delivery; such outcomes have been strongly associated with ZIKV
infection during pregnancy8,9. However, infection with other
flaviviruses such as dengue virus are rarely associated with fetal
infection or severe birth defects10, suggesting that ZIKV is quite
unique
in
this
regard.
Furthermore,
these
observations
strongly suggest a component of placental dysfunction in ZIKV
cases, which has not previously been extensively investigated
in vivo.
Prompted by the ZIKV epidemic, recent efforts to understand
the detrimental effects of this virus on the developing fetus and
pregnancy outcomes have expanded exponentially. The presence
of ZIKV RNA in the mother, fetal brain and amniotic fluid (AF)
during human pregnancy has been reported11–13. Much of the
attention to date has been focused on the biology of ZIKV14, the
Aedes spp. mosquito vector control15, birth defects including
microcephaly16–18, and sexual transmission of the virus19,20.
However, because of the immunologic complexity of pregnancy,
the maternal-feto-placental immune responses and neonatal
neurodevelopmental consequences from ZIKV infection in utero
have yet to be fully explored. Recent studies by our group and
others21–26 identified the presence of ZIKV RNA in the plasma of
experimentally infected rhesus monkeys, as well as a robust
immune response, including ZIKV-specific antibodies and T-cells
in non-pregnant adult animals. ZIKV infection of a single preg-
nant pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina) resulted in several
sequelae in the fetus reminiscent of CZS in humans, including
restricted fetal brain growth and the presence of viral RNA in the
fetal brain27. Additionally, infection of pregnant rhesus macaques
using the French Polynesian ZIKV strain has similarly demon-
strated some evidence of disrupted fetal growth, prolonged
maternal viremia, and inflammation at the maternal-fetal inter-
face, including mild decidual perivascular inflammation (not
unusual in human decidua) and placental acute chorioamnionitis,
which is almost always associated with a bacterial intra-amniotic
infection28. However, the impact of ZIKV infection on in vivo
uteroplacental blood flow and oxygen transport has not pre-
viously been examined or correlated with in vitro placental
histology.
As the placenta has a critical role in fetal development and
pregnancy success, attention has been focused on the mechanisms
by which ZIKV transmission occurs, the placental cell types
impacted and the adverse effects of maternal ZIKV infection29–35.
However, placenta studies are impeded by the inability to
examine placental function in vivo, with most data generated
from post-delivery in vitro studies. Recently, we have made
advancements to overcome this hurdle through the development
of placenta-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols
that provide quantitative assessment of placental perfusion and
oxygenation in vivo. These protocols have been developed and
validated in nonhuman primate models of perturbation during
pregnancy36,37. Like humans, the nonhuman primate has a long
gestation and a hemochorial placenta, making this a well-suited
translational model to understand human disease mechanisms.
The available data from nonhuman primate studies and human
cohorts suggest some underlying inflammation contributing to
the placental dysfunction in ZIKV-infected pregnancies, but prior
to now, such assessments have not been linked to an in vivo
functional correlate.
In order to investigate the effect of maternal ZIKV infection
during pregnancy, five pregnant rhesus macaques were infected
with ZIKV at different time points across gestation. We hypo-
thesized that ZIKV infection would induce both placental and
fetal inflammation and perturb placental function. Maternal viral
loads as well as innate and adaptive immune responses were
measured longitudinally following ZIKV infection. Chronological
evaluation of fetal growth, uteroplacental blood flow and amniotic
fluid index were assessed via non-invasive ultrasound (US)
throughout pregnancy. Moreover, we employed our in vivo
imaging capabilities to quantify placental perfusion and oxyge-
nation
following
maternal
ZIKV
infection.
Uteroplacental
pathology was reviewed to test for correlations between tissue
structure and functional assay results. Comprehensive immuno-
phenotyping and quantification of viral RNA in maternal, pla-
cental and fetal tissue samples was performed post-delivery.
Results
Nonhuman primate model of ZIKV during pregnancy. Five
pregnant rhesus macaques (time-mated breeding) were infected
with ZIKV (strain PRVABC59) at 31 days of gestation (dGA)
(animal ID: D27428), 51 dGA (animals: D23046 and D27427),
114 dGA (animal: D28380) and 115 dGA (animal: D27406).
(Throughout this manuscript, animal identification numbers will
be preceded by “D”, indicating dams or “F” indicating fetuses).
Full term in rhesus macaques is 168 days. The dams received
ZIKV inoculum (1 × 105 ffu) divided over 10 subcutaneous
injections in the hand, wrist and upper arm (1 × 104 ffu per
injection site)22. Each pregnancy was monitored following
infection by serial physical exams, blood counts, a total chemistry
panel and ultrasound. Cesarean section delivery was performed
for all animals at 135dGA, at which time maternal and fetal tis-
sues were collected and processed (Fig. 1). Six uninfected control
rhesus macaques from two ongoing studies were used as a
comparative data set for all placental parameters unless otherwise
noted. These animals underwent advanced imaging, were simi-
larly delivered at 135dGA, and experienced no treatments or
manipulations during pregnancy.
Innate and adaptive immune responses after ZIKV infection.
We monitored the development of the maternal immune
response post-ZIKV infection by utilizing PBMCs isolated from
blood samples at various days post infection (dpi). PBMCs were
phenotypically analyzed by flow cytometry using antibody panels
designed to identify innate immune cell activation as well as

 adaptive immune T- and B-cell proliferative responses. Innate
immune cells were classified as monocyte/ macrophages, myeloid
dendritic cells (DC), natural killer (NK) cells, or other (non-
myeloid DC) based on the gating strategy described in “Methods”
section. Within 5 dpi, all dams showed innate immune cell
activation as demonstrated by the presence of CD169+ staining
within monocyte/ macrophage, myeloid DC, and NK subsets
(Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). Activation of NK cells was observed
from 12–21 dpi in some dams, additionally, DCs and NK cells
displayed elevated activation at 70 and 85 dpi. CD8 T-cell pro-
liferation peaked from 5 to 14 dpi for naive, effector memory
(TEM), and central memory (TCM) subsets with a second time
point of proliferation for the TEM and TCM subsets at 56 dpi. B-
cell proliferative burst responses were maximal at 10–14 dpi
(Supplementary Fig. 1d–f). ZIKV-specific maternal antibodies
were detected as early as 6 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 2), and
antibody titers increased through 28 dpi. Analysis of maternal
and fetal serum collected at 85 dpi showed neutralizing activity
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Maternal viral loads and tissue distribution. During the period
between infection and delivery of the fetus, viral RNA was
detected in the dam’s serum from four out of five animals at 3
dpi, which is consistent with previous reports of ZIKV infection
in rhesus macaques21,22. Serum from animal D23046 was not
sampled between days 1 and 6 post infection and was negative for
viral RNA at 7 dpi. However, viral RNA was detected in the urine
for this animal for most of the time points (2–85 dpi, Supple-
mentary Fig. 3). In animal D27428 (31 dGA), viral RNA in the
urine was detected sporadically through 84 dpi; whereas the other
animals had more limited detection profiles. A number of
maternal tissues were positive for ZIKV RNA at necropsy,
including the genitourinary tract, brain, peripheral nerves and
spinal cord, as well as joint and muscle tissues (Supplementary
Table 1), demonstrating that ZIKV persists in maternal tissues
and is shed in urine for extended periods of time post infection.
Fetal viral loads and tissue distribution. Viral RNA was detected
in the urine of all five fetuses, indicating that all were infected and
persistently shedding viral RNA in their urine (Supplementary
Table 2). In addition, RNA was detected in tissue from all of the
fetuses except animal F35878 (51 dGA infection) (Supplementary
Table 3). Viral RNA-positive tissues included spinal cord, tri-
geminal cranial nerve, brachial plexus, peripheral nerves, eye,
thyroid, pituitary gland, thymus, tonsil, finger joints, elbow,
hamstring, bladder, uterus, myometrium, cervix, and ovary
(Supplementary Table 3). In addition, amniotic fluid of fetus
F35467 was positive for viral RNA at necropsy (85 dpi), and
animals F35972 (104 dpi) and F35878 (85 dpi) had detectable
levels of viral RNA in their CSF (Supplementary Table 2). The
brain of animal F35797 was examined for viral RNA, following
observation of anomalous fetal brain MRI (see below), and a
detectable level of RNA was found. Combined, these data indicate
that each of the fetuses were infected following subcutaneous
infection of the dams and that viral RNA persisted; the latter is
consistent with our previous findings in non-pregnant rhesus
macaques22.
Placental viral loads. The hemochorial placenta of the rhesus
macaque is similar to that of the human, but is distinguished by
two lobes38. The umbilical cord attaches centrally to a primary
lobe and clusters of bridging vessels supply a structurally inde-
pendent secondary lobe. To comprehensively assess viral load in
the placenta, RNA was isolated from each individually mapped
and identified cotyledon from both the primary and secondary
lobes (Table 1). In humans and nonhuman primates, cotyledons
are perfusion domains defined by septa, which include a maternal
blood pool (intervillous space) and fetal vasculature within the
villous tissue for nutrient exchange38. As shown in Table 1, ZIKV
RNA was detected in placental tissues from four of the five ani-
mals (D23046, D27427, D27406 and D28380). For animal
D23046, two sections were positive in the primary placenta:
peripherally located cotyledons #3 and #5; and three in the sec-
ondary placenta: peripherally located cotyledon #1, #3 and #6
(Supplementary Fig. 7 shows gross photos of each of the five
ZIKV placentas with individually identified, annotated and
numbered cotyledons depicting the relative location of each
sample site). These findings suggest that placental infection may
be focal, rather than diffuse and widespread. The two other
positive animals had reduced numbers of positive cotyledons
(Table 1). While the exact route and timing of placental transfer
and fetal infection relative to the dams is unknown, these data
argue that ZIKV infects the placenta and fetal tissues, which can
remain persistently viral RNA positive for 85 dpi.
To confirm ZIKV infection of the placenta, trophoblast cells
were isolated from placental tissue from three animals (D27428,
D27427, and D28380). Cells were maintained in culture for 3 days
and used for detection of ZIKV envelope (E) protein by
immunofluoresence analysis (IFA) at 1, 2, and 3 days post-
plating (dpp). Supernatants conditioned for 24 h were collected
immediately prior to IFA and viral titers determined on Vero cells
by plaque assay. Gradient-banded cells stained strongly for
cytokeratin 7 (Supplementary Fig. 4a), while phase microscopy
confirmed the presence of mononuclear cytotrophoblasts (CTB)
at 1 dpp with fusion to yield differentiated syncytiotrophoblasts
(STB) by 3 dpp (Supplementary Fig. 4b). While trophoblasts were
the predominant cell type in these cultures, occasional cells with
the morphology of Hofbauer cells (HC) and lymphocytes were
observed. Infectious virus was recovered from the placental
cultures derived from animal D28380 (0.33 pfu/ml on 1 dpp;
100 pfu/ml on 2 dpp; 100 pfu/ml on 3 dpp), but not from the
other two animals. In cultures from all three animals however,
cells expressing ZIKV E protein were occasionally observed.
These were typically trophoblasts but cells resembling HC and

 lymphocytes were also found (Supplementary Fig. 4c). In keeping
with infectious virus recovery, placental cultures derived from

 cytometric antibody panels specific for innate and T-cell subsets.
The frequency of activated innate immune cells (monocytes/
macrophages and DCs) was higher in placental tissues from
ZIKV-infected dams vs. control dams (Fig. 2a, b, d). There was a
significant increase in the percent of activated (CD169+) mono-
cyte/macrophages from ZIKV-infected placenta tissues compared
to uninfected controls in both the decidua (p < 0.01, one-way
ANOVA) and villous (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). The mono-
cyte population was further divided into three functionally dif-
ferent subsets based on CD14 and CD16 expression: classical
(CD14hiCD16−), intermediate (CD14hiCD16+), and non-classical
(CD14loCD16+) monocytes. Surprisingly, the ratio of classical to
non-classical monocytes was decreased in both decidua and vil-
lous from ZIKV-infected dams compared to uninfected controls
(Fig. 2c). Classical monocytes are involved in wound healing,
antigen presentation, and typically secrete IL-10, while non-
classical monocytes actively patrol tissues following damage and
secrete inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-
12)39. Staining of placenta tissues for macrophage subtypes via
CD68 (M1) and CD163 (M2) showed both populations were
present, with an increase in M1 macrophages in the villous
stroma during ZIKV infection (Supplementary Fig. 5). Pro-
liferation of CD4 T cells was also increased in placenta tissues
from ZIKV-infected dams compared to uninfected controls.
These differences were most evident and significant in the CD4
TEM (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) and CD4 TCM (p < 0.01, one-
way ANOVA) cell subsets (Fig. 2e, f). These results suggest an
active inflammatory immune response is maintained in the pla-
centa following ZIKV infection.
Cytokine and chemokine production. A Luminex NHP Cyto-
kine Magnetic 29-plex panel was used to quantify cytokine and
chemokine expression in umbilical blood, fetal circulation, and
amniotic and cerebral spinal fluids. Fetal peripheral blood
and arterial/venous umbilical cord blood were collected at
delivery from ZIKV-infected animals (135dGA) and age-matched
controls. Because of the direction of blood flow, inflammatory
mediators present in fetal peripheral blood and umbilical artery
can be considered to originate within the fetus, while inflam-
matory mediators present in the umbilical vein originate within
the placenta. Similar expression of IL-1RA, IL-1β, IL-12, MCP-1
(CCL-2), MDC (CCL-22), IFNγ, and IP-10 (CXCL-10) was
observed between fetal plasma, and the umbilical artery and vein
circulations, implying that the placenta and fetus are immuno-
logically responding to ZIKV (Fig. 3a). The production of
inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-12 is consistent
with the observed shift toward non-classical monocytes present in

 the placenta villous and decidua. However, the expression of I-
TAC (CXCL-11) was predominately higher in fetal plasma.
Comparatively, the expression of all these cytokines was minimal
in the maternal circulation. Cytokine profiling of amniotic fluid
revealed increased levels of IL-6, Eotaxin (CCL-11), MCP-1
(CCL-2), and FGF-β (Fig. 3b). Together these finding are quite
dramatic and suggest that the fetus is undergoing a significant
inflammatory immune response. Similarly, the CSF of the fetus
had significantly elevated levels of IL-1RA, Eotaxin (CCL-11),
MCP-1 (CCL-2) and IP-10 (CXCL-10) compared to the maternal
CSF (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA), which could be indicative of an
ongoing viral infection (Fig. 3c).
Assessment of uteroplacental blood flow. Longitudinal assess-
ments of uteroplacental hemodynamics and fetal growth were
made by ultrasound examinations prior to infection and across
gestation until delivery. Neither the uterine artery pulsatility
index (PI), nor the umbilical artery PI, deviated from control in
any of the ZIKV animals (Fig. 4a, b). Control animal data were
obtained at two gestational ages: 85dGA and 135dGA (Fig. 4a–d).
Quantitative estimation of volumetric blood flow in the uterine
artery with ultrasound has been used by our group and others to
assess perfusion on the maternal side of the placenta40–43. The
calculated blood flow volume in the uterine artery (cQuta) cor-
rected for maternal body weight demonstrated some variability
between ZIKV animals, but revealed an overall trend to
increasing with advancing gestational age, as would be anticipated
(Fig. 5c). Similarly, the quantitative estimation of blood flow on
the fetal side of the placenta41,44,45, the calculated blood flow in
the umbilical vein (cQuv) also increased across gestation, with
values comparable to uninfected control animals, (Fig. 4d). While
Doppler ultrasound provides a semi-quantitative estimation of
blood flow, it is limited to measurements in major vessels both
proximal and distal to the placental circulation contributing to a
lack of sensitivity to detect placental dysfunction. Significantly, we
observed an increase in echogenicity of the placenta in all three of
the ZIKV animals infected early in gestation. This observation
was consistently observed and all ultrasound exams were per-
formed by one ultrasonographer (AEF) with similar image
acquisition parameters. This finding was apparent at ~40 dpi
(mid-gestation, Fig. 4f) and is suggestive of inflammation and/or
ischemic injury. Given the increased echogenicity of the placenta
and the limitations of Doppler ultrasound to assess placental
function in vivo, we employed advanced non-invasive imaging
modalities prior to delivery at 135dGA to further evaluate pla-
cental vascular function in vivo36,37,46,47.
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with maternal infusion
of Definity® contrast agent was used to locate and visualize spiral
artery sources supplying individual placental cotyledons from the
ZIKV-infected animals and uninfected controls at 135dGA. The
flux rate constant (β) provides a measure of microvascular
resistance and gives an indirect measure of blood flow in the
placental intervillous space47. In comparing microvascular flux
rates from ZIKV-infected animals to data from uninfected control
animals at 135dGA, we observed a significant increase in flux rate
regardless of gestational age at the time of infection (Fig. 4g, p <
0.0001 one-way ANOVA). While our CEUS data analysis
visualizes the spiral artery sources that supply individual placental
cotyledons, it does not allow for absolute quantification of blood
flow volumes, instead reflecting the change in vascular impe-
dance. The increase in flux rate following in utero infection with
ZIKV is indicative of increased velocity of maternal blood being
delivered to the intervillous space from the spiral arteries, which
may result in shear stress-induced placental injury.
Placental perfusion and oxygenation by MRI. As CEUS may not
reflect the global regional perfusion differences amongst cotyle-
dons, we also employed novel MRI techniques for placental
imaging at 135dGA36,37. Our group has recently developed MRI
methods to quantify maternal perfusion of the placenta using
both Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to inter-
rogate delivery and transport of maternal blood in the pla-
centa36,47, and Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) MRI to
characterize placental oxygenation, (via T2 * mapping)37. This
technique enables us to separately quantify placental perfusion
and placental oxygenation while accounting for the complex
vascular network of the intervillous space. When comparing
DCE-MRI results for the five ZIKV-infected animals to a group of
six pregnant rhesus macaque controls matched at 135dGA, we
found modest, but not statistically significant, decreases in both
total placental blood flow (139 ml/min vs. 161 ml/min, respec-
tively) and normalized placental blood flow (1.14 ml/ml/min vs.
1.25 ml/ml/min, respectively). Histograms of R2 * (= 1/T2*, nor-
malized to placental volume) reveal that four of the five ZIKV-
infected animals (excepting D27406) demonstrated a higher level
of oxygenated maternal blood within the placenta as compared to
the control group (Fig. 4j). We modeled the spatial distribution of
T2* values within the placenta to estimate the ratio of oxygen
permeability-surface area product to blood flow37. Combining
these values with flow estimates from DCE-MRI, revealed large
and statistically significant decreases (PSvi = 1.22 × 106 vs. PSvi =
8.69 × 106, p = 0.018) in oxygen permeability-surface area product
in the ZIKV-infected dams relative to control animals. PSvi is a
parameter representing the efficiency of oxygen transport from
intervillous space to the fetal villi and is quantitated as the pro-
duct of fetal villous permeability, fetal villous surface area and
intervillous space37. P values were calculated using a non-
parametric two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. D27406 was
also an outlier in these data, with oxygen permeability values in
the low range of the control animals. Combined with our
observation of nearly normal maternal blood flow and increased
levels of oxygenated blood within the placenta, these results
strongly suggest that ZIKV infection impairs transplacental
transport of oxygen, potentially resulting in long-term fetal
oxygen deprivation during gestation, likely secondary to placental
damage occurring at the level of the fetal villi. Furthermore,
high-resolution post-contrast imaging reveals both gross and
scattered punctate regions of placental infarction with no sig-
nificant

perfusion in the placenta from the ZIKV-infected dams. Lastly,

and secondary lobes generated by MRI analysis with the gross

Placental and fetal growth after ZIKV exposure. Serial fetal
biometry measurements made by ultrasound enabled fetal growth
to be tracked across gestation. Abdominal circumference, head
circumference, biparietal diameter, and femur length did not
deviate from the reference data across gestation (Supplementary
Fig. 6). Amniotic fluid levels were on the lower end of the normal
control range at 135dGA for all ZIKV animals (Supplementary
Fig. 6e). Fetal weight at 135dGA is reported in Table 1. Of note,
there is variability across the five ZIKV-infected animals, but
mean fetal weight did not differ from the control fetal cohort and
we did not find evidence of fetal growth restriction following
ZIKV infection. Importantly, cesarean section delivery of the

 fetus was performed at 135dGA, which corresponds to the early
third trimester and the start of the exponential fetal growth
period. Deviation from the normal growth trajectory may have
manifested if the pregnancy had been continued closer to term of
168dGA. Placental weight was greater in the ZIKV-infected ani-
mals compared to controls; importantly, calculated fetal:placental
weight ratio was decreased in 4 out of 5 animals. The fetal:pla-
cental ratio is often used as a proxy for placental efficiency48 and
the decrease in this ratio may reflect aberrant placental function
following in utero ZIKV infection, which is consistent with both
our functional imaging data (Fig. 4) and the placenta pathology
described below.
Uteroplacental pathology. All five ZIKV-infected cases showed
at least microscopic placental infarctions (Fig. 5a). Larger gross
infarctions were visible in the cases infected earlier in gestation
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Additionally, there was a subtle pattern of
villous stromal calcifications compared with the gestational age-
matched uninfected controls (Fig. 5b), which we concluded is
most likely a feature of stromal fibroblast cell necrosis (Fig. 5c).
Villous maturation was similar between cases and controls.
Chorionic villi were negative for chronic villitis (feature some-
times seen in viral infections like CMV, or herpes), but ZIKV-
infected cases did have diagnostic chronic decidualitis with
plasma cells, which are required for the diagnosis. Two of the five
cases had a pronounced leukocytoclastic vasculitis with a mixture
of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and a few eosinophils infiltrating the
spiral artery muscular wall (Fig. 5c, d). This type of vasculitis is
usually related to a hypersensitivity reaction, but viral infections
are also a well-recognized etiology49. In the three of the ZIKV
cases infected at days 31–51, some of the spiral arteries also had
less active inflammation, but clearly showed evidence of more
remote lymphocytic vasculitis with medial damage and abnormal
fibrin deposition (not part of the normal physiologic changes that
characterize pregnancy-induced vascular remodeling (Fig. 5e, f)50.
Spiral artery vasculitis was absent in the two ZIKV cases infected
at 115dGA (these two cases also had fewer plasma cells in the
decidua, fewer placental villous calcifications, and only micro-
scopic placental infarctions), which likely reflects the shorter time
between infection and tissue collection.
MRI of the fetal brain. In spite of ZIKV-induced pathology and
disruption of placental function, only minor effects on fetal brain
development were observed by fetal MRI at 135dGA. To facilitate
examining potential fetal brain abnormalities following ZIKV
infection, T2W volumes of each ZIKV-infected fetal brain were
linearly registered to a template generated from 16 age-matched
experimentally-naive
controls
(manuscript
in
preparation).
Sagittal (Fig. 6a) and axial views (Fig. 6a) at indicated levels
(Fig. 6, insets) are shown for the template and a 135dGA
experimentally naive fetus of an uninfected dam. Fetal brain T2W
MRI are shown at corresponding locations for each ZIKV-
infected animal in Fig. 6c. In contrast to human fetuses exposed
in the first trimester51 and a pigtail macaque infected at 119dGA
of a 162dGA term27, no obvious signal intensity anomalies within
the cerebral cortical gray matter or fetal white matter of the T2W
images were observed in the infected animal (Fig. 6a, b). Subtle
abnormalities were observed in two of the fetal brains. A thinner
postcentral gyrus, and a missing secondary sulcus was identified
in animal F35467 (Fig. 6a, red and yellow arrows, note the “Y”-
shaped post central gyrus in the template and other 4 ZIKV-
infected fetal brains). To better characterize the abnormal gyral
folding pattern detected in this animal, a 3D cortical surface
model was generated and curvature of the cortical surface was

 rendered on the surface (Fig. 7a, top, lateral view; bottom, dorsal
view), and an age-matched control (Fig. 7b). The surface area of
the post-central gyrus, quantified as the percent of isocortex, for
10 age-matched controls fetuses studied previously52. In these
animals, the post-central gyrus occupies between 4.4 and 5.7% of
the isocortex (mean ± SD of 5.04 ± 0.45). The post-central gyrus
for animal F35467 occupied 4.3% of the isocortex, which is
smaller than all 10 control animals previously studied, and 1.6 SD
smaller than the average value for controls. In animal F35797,
reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was observed in the
right motor, somatosensory, and auditory cortices compared to
the left hemisphere (Fig. 7d, red circles). The cortical regions
marked by lower ADC were continuous throughout multiple
levels (Fig. 7d). An ADC map template generated from 8 control
fetuses at matched gestational age show homogeneous cortical
ADC between hemispheres, and throughout the entire cerebral
cortex (Fig. 7c). At necropsy, brain tissue from the low ADC
regions (Fig. 7d, red circles) was dissected and determined to be
positive for ZIKV RNA. Interestingly, F35797 was the fetus of
dam D27406, the only ZIKV-infected animal with microvascular
flux rate and placental oxygen permeability that was comparable
to uninfected controls.
Fetal pathology. Histological assessment of the genitourinary
tract revealed the presence of tissue and cellular damage in the
female and male fetuses (Fig. 8). Neutrophilic inflammation
(cystitis) of the bladder wall was identified in one animal (F35972,
31 dGA infection) and lymphocytic inflammation of the pelvic
floor adjacent to the bladder was identified in one animal
(F35865, 114 dGA infection). Interstitial hemorrhage was seen in
sections of the testis from three animals (F35878, F35865, and
F35797), indicating vascular damage following ZIKV infection.
Individual apoptotic cells and cells undergoing vacuolar degen-
eration were present in testis, seminal vesicle, vas deferens, and
prostate (Fig. 8). Damage in the seminal vesicle was generally focal
and involved both the epithelial cells and the underlying smooth
muscle cells. Similarly, abnormal focal interstitial hemorrhage was
present in the cervix of F35467 (51 dGA infection) as well as
smooth muscle cell degeneration. While we did not detect ZIKV
RNA in all of the affected tissues, this could be due to the focal
nature of infection, assay sensitivity or viral clearance by the time
of necropsy. The collective observations of viral detection in the
urine from all fetuses and some of the female and male fetal
reproductive tracts combined with cellular and vascular damage to
these tissues suggest that fetal genitourinary tracts are targeted by
ZIKV and viral mediated pathogenesis.

 Discussion
We describe a translational nonhuman primate pregnancy model
of ZIKV infection using a clinically relevant strain of ZIKV53. We
demonstrate productive infection of five pregnant rhesus maca-
ques at three different time points across gestation and draw
comparisons to gestational-age-matched uninfected controls. We
observed long-term persistence of virus in both maternal and fetal
tissues, robust maternal and fetal innate and adaptive immune
responses, and a systemic fetal inflammatory response to con-
genital infection with ZIKV. In addition, we report aberrant
in vivo placental function secondary to ZIKV infection related to
uteroplacental pathology. Notably, we did not observe fetal
growth restriction or microcephaly in these animals. Importantly,
initial reports from the WHO and CDC highlighted microcephaly
as the major concern with vertical transmission of ZIKV infection
in pregnancy. However, recent studies refer to a more inclusive
clinical syndrome with microcephaly representing only one severe
manifestation despite a range of adverse obstetric outcomes
associated with ZIKV infection. In agreement with these studies,
we detected neurological development abnormalities in two out of
five fetuses in our ZIKV-infected cohort. Indeed, human epide-
miological data suggest a spectrum of responses to ZIKV expo-
sure during pregnancy3,4, and our data in pregnant rhesus
macaques support and strengthen this finding with a range of
fetal responses demonstrated following maternal ZIKV infection.
Previous studies by Nguyen and Dudley identified prolonged
viremia following ZIKV infection in pregnant rhesus macaques
relative to non-pregnant ZIKV-infected animals21,28. We did not
observe this prolonged viremia in our study, which could be due
to the lower sensitivity of our detection assays or the reduced
frequency of blood sampling. While we cannot determine the
precise timing of placental and fetal infection after subcutaneous
maternal infection with ZIKV, detection of virus in the placenta
and fetus in the animals infected at 115dGA and delivered 20dpi
indicate that transplacental fetal infection can occur rapidly. We
hypothesize that this process occurs during the early peak phase
of maternal viremia. Viral RNA was detected in maternal serum
as early as 3dpi and persists in maternal tissues and urine for
extended periods, up to 85 dpi in this study, which is consistent
with previous findings in non-pregnant rhesus macaques22,26.
The persistence in maternal tissues could provide a reservoir
facilitating vertical transmission of ZIKV. Furthermore, viral
RNA in the maternal genitourinary tract, particularly the uterus,
may be a concern when contemplating invasive diagnostic testing
with amniocentesis and merits further investigation. Similarly,
viral RNA was detected in the fetus and placenta at 85 dpi in spite
of the immune response mounted by both the dam and fetus. The
wide distribution of viral RNA in fetal tissues, similar to the
maternal distribution, provides a foundation to interpret the
varied phenotypes reported in the CZS, and provide a basis for
understanding the broad range of developmental consequences
that may result from CZS. While detection of ZIKV RNA in the
urine from all fetuses, combined with the pathologic changes in
the fetal genitourinary and reproductive tracts, suggests that fetal
urinary and reproductive tracts are targeted by ZIKV and virus-
mediated pathogenesis, the long-term pathologic consequences
are potentially significant and warrant further investigation.
As other groups have recently reported with a different strain
of ZIKV28, fetal infection occurred at all gestational time points,
which is consistent with human reports5 of infection occurring
both early and late in gestation. Uncertainty exists on the sus-
ceptibility of human trophoblasts to infection with ZIKV in vitro,
with some reports suggesting greater placental tropism in first vs.
third trimester placenta trophoblasts30,35,54. Our primary tro-
phoblast cultures from ZIKV-infected dams demonstrate ZIKV E
protein expression from animals infected at 31, 51 and 114 dGA,
suggesting all are susceptible to infection. Furthermore, viral RNA
was detected only in the primary trophoblast culture from 114
dGA infection, which also contained the most ZIKV E-expressing
cells, possibly reflecting the short time elapsed between maternal
infection and tissue collection (21 days). Human studies have
suggested that vertical transmission may take 5 weeks; here we
detected vertical transmission in two macaques infected at the
end of the 2nd trimester within 20 days.

 We comprehensively evaluated the interplay between the
maternal-fetal and placental inflammatory milieu in response to
ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Our data suggests that ZIKV
exposure in utero produces a robust proinflammatory fetal
immune response characterized by alterations in classical vs. non-
classical monocyte phenotype and presence of activated CD4 T-
cells as well as elevated cytokines (IL-12, IL-2 TNFα and IFNγ)
and the chemokine IP-10 (CXCL-10). IP-10 is inducible by
proinflammatory mediators such as interferon-γ (IFNγ), TNFα,
and several viruses55–58. This chemokine is involved in the
recruitment and potentiation of Th1 type inflammatory respon-
ses. The fetus is a semi-allograft, and active maternal tolerance
mechanisms (Th2 and Treg recruitment) are critical to prevent
fetal rejection. Inflammation of the placenta and decidua due to
viral infections not only alters fetal organ development but also
alters the fetal immune system, and can result in aberrant post-
natal immune responses to infections8,59. The implication is that
in utero ZIKV infection may cause vulnerability in the neonatal
innate and adaptive immune responses and thus increase the
susceptibility to subsequent sepsis, additional infections and
autoimmune diseases.
Functional imaging of the placenta in vivo by CEUS and MRI
provide compelling evidence that ZIKV can alter placental
function (summarized by the placental schematic in Fig. 9). First,
the CEUS data in 4 of 5 ZIKV animals demonstrate an increased
flux rate through the spiral arteries into the intervillous space.
The microvascular flux rate data generated from our CEUS
analysis represents the in-flow velocity of the contrast agent as it
enters the intervillous space. This velocity is a component of flow
but does not equate directly with blood flow, which requires a
measure of volume; achieved in our studies by using DCE-MRI
immediately following CEUS. Nonetheless, together with spiral
artery histopathology, this increased rate of in-flow velocity could
result in shear stress injury to the placental villi, which may
explain the observed decrease in permeability-surface area pro-
duct by functional MRI. Specifically, functional MRI demon-
strated a higher level of oxygenated maternal blood within the
placenta and decreased oxygen permeability-surface area product
with ZIKV infection in the same 4 of 5 animals. The increased
level of oxygenated maternal blood within the placenta could
reflect decreased oxygen permeability across the villous tropho-
blast and/or decreased fetal metabolic demand. The decreased
oxygen permeability-surface area product with ZIKV infection
suggests that disruption in oxygen permeability across the villous
trophoblast contributes to this higher-than-expected oxygenation
of maternal blood within the placenta. The increased echogenic
appearance observed with ultrasound that was also confirmed by
high-resolution post-contrast MRI revealed placental lesions that
were subsequently shown to be gross and microscopic infarctions
and villous stromal calcifications. We suspect placental damage
leads to decreased oxygen permeability, which may provide a
mechanism for the observed association between ZIKV infection
and adverse obstetric outcomes, including stillbirth, in some cases
of CZS. The placenta pathology observed in our study recapitu-
lates many features of pathology reported in post-delivery ZIKV-
infected human placentas with villous calcification, stromal
proliferation, and intravillous and perivillous fibrin deposi-
tion60,61; microscopic structural changes which could impact
oxygen transport across the villi.
We did not detect IUGR in this model, the macaques were
delivered at 135dGA, prior to the significant growth phase in the
third trimester; as a result, we cannot exclude the possibility that
fetal growth abnormalities may have been observed if the preg-
nancies had been taken to term. In one animal infected at 115
dGA, placental function both by CEUS and MRI was similar to
control animals despite it demonstrating fetal infection similar to
the other ZIKV-infected animals. This finding suggests that, while
placental dysfunction could contribute or exacerbate fetal devel-
opmental disruption associated with infection, fetal infection can
occur in spite of normal placental function in vivo. The placental
infection to ZIKV is focal, which was determined only by com-
prehensive biopsy of all placental perfusion domains. Interest-
ingly, the focal areas where virus was detected corresponded to
the regions with decreased perfusion and gross infarctions in the
one animal where three-dimensional isosurfaces were rendered.
Fetal ultrasound and biometry did not demonstrate evidence of
microcephaly, which was confirmed with fetal MRI, and at
delivery. Further, T2-weighted image hyperintensities in germinal
zones or developing white matter, reported in other studies of
ZIKV-infected nonhuman primates27,28, were not observed for
any of the animals examined here. Although it is not possible to
conclude that placental pathology is completely separable from
brain injury because subtle fetal brain abnormalities were
observed by in utero MRI in 2 of 5 infected animals, the overall
absence of severe brain pathology, in the presence of perturbed
placental function resulting from ZIKV infection in this model, is
notable. In one animal (F35797), a region in the cerebral cortex
with conspicuously low ADC was observed. Viral RNA was
recovered from this area. In a second animal (F35467), an
anomalous shape of the post-central gyrus and the absence of a
minor sulcus immediately caudal to the dorsal central sulcus were
observed. Although these cortical surface characteristics resulted
in the formation of an extremely small post-central gyrus (smaller
than 10 age-matched fetuses examined in a recent study52), this
cortical shape anomaly is sufficiently subtle that the possibility it
is a rare cortical folding variant cannot be excluded. In the 2
animals where CNS abnormalities were identified, the effects of
infection appeared to be focal, as in the placenta. However,
additional regions of infected brain cannot be excluded for all
fetuses. The animal with the virally-infected cortical region of
reduced water ADC was infected relatively late in pregnancy
(115dGA), and placental function was normal, as assessed with
in vivo imaging. This suggests that placental injury, as detected by
our methods, is not a prerequisite to vertical transmission. The
varying degrees of neurodevelopmental disruption reported in
CZS thus may reflect damage resulting from inflammation and
placental dysfunction when fetal metabolic requirements exceed
the placental reserve capacity in addition to any direct tissue
injury from ZIKV. Clarification of the relative roles of these two
factors in CNS injury will require further study.
In summary, this work in a nonhuman primate model that
shares developmental ontogeny with humans demonstrates that
ZIKV infection during pregnancy results in a spectrum of feto-
placental outcomes. Our findings not only highlight the need for
further understanding of the causal mechanisms of ZIKV infec-
tion, but demonstrate the importance of redefining the clinical
criteria and assessment of pregnant mothers suspected for
infection. Improved antenatal monitoring may allow for mod-
ification of clinical management plans and reduce the adverse
impact of maternal ZIKV infection on fetal and neonatal devel-
opmental consequences.

 Zika virus PRVABC59. Zika virus isolate PRVABC5922,53 was generously pro-
vided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). PRVABC59 was passed twice on
C6/36 cells (ATCC CRL-1660), and a working stock was concentrated by ultra-
centrifugation through a 20% sorbitol cushion and titered in Vero cells (ATCC
CRL-1586). The working stock was sequenced and described previously22. All cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing
penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine and 5–10% fetal calf serum (FCS).
Study design. Gestational age was determined by monitoring daily blood samples
for the mid-cycle peak in estradiol, which immediately precedes the surge of
luteinizing hormone responsible for ovulation. Females are paired with males
several days prior to the estradiol surge and are then separated the day after peak
levels are observed. Day 1 of gestation is considered 48 h post-estradiol surge. This
timed-mating scheme allows for gestational age to be determined within 24–48 h of
conception. At 31, 51, 114, and 115 days of gestation (dGA; term = 168 days)
timed-pregnant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were infected subcutaneously
with a total of 1 × 105 focus-forming units (ffu) of ZIKV PRABC59 diluted in 1 ml
of PBS that was distributed over both hands, wrists and upper arms as 10–100 µl
injections (to mimic the typical pattern of mosquito bites)22. The dams were
evaluated daily for clinical signs of disease. Body temperature along with peripheral
blood and urine samples were obtained, and fetal/placental ultrasound analyses
were performed at indicated times post infection (Fig. 1). Blood was collected on 0,
3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 43, 49, 57, 63, 71, 78, 85, 91, 98, and 105 dpi with the following
exceptions: (1) Animals D28380 and D27406 was taken to necropsy at 21 dpi; (2)
Animals D23046 and D27427 were taken to necropsy at 85 dpi; and (3) day 3 was
not collected for D23046. Collection of blood samples and ultrasound analysis were
performed under ketamine sedation (10 mg/kg, IM). Peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were isolated by centrifugation over lymphocyte
separation medium and then analyzed for lymphocyte phenotype and frequency by
flow cytometry. Plasma was assessed for viral load by qRT-PCR and the levels of
cytokines by a multiplex-bead based assay. Urine and saliva were assessed for viral
RNA by qRT-PCR and for infectious virus by co-culture and focus-forming assays
using Vero cells. An in utero MRI scan of the fetal brain and placenta was per-
formed just prior to delivery. Necropsy was performed on the all of the dams and
fetuses at 135dGA. Samples of maternal and fetal tissues (joints, muscles, organs,
brain, spinal cord, eyes, glands, lymph nodes and bone marrow) and biological
fluids (cerebral spinal fluid, blood, amniotic fluid, and urine) were collected and
stored in RNAlater, Trizol (RNA isolation), medium (virus isolation) as well as
formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin.
ZIKV detection by one-step qRT-PCR analysis. RNA from maternal, fetal and
placental tissue samples, blood, urine, CSF, and amniotic fluid was isolated using
Trizol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. ZIKV RNA levels were
measured by a one-step quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) using TaqMan® One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems). Primers and probes were as previously described62 with a
one base change in the probe to match the PRVABC59 sequence (Genbank
accession #: KU501215.1). Forward primer: 5′- CCGCTGCCCAACACAAG-3′
(ZIKV PRVABC59 genome sequence nucleotides 1192–1208); reverse: 5′-
CCACTAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT-3′ (complement of nucleotides
1245–1268); and TaqMan probe: 5′ Fam-5′-AGCCTACCTTGACAAGCAATCA-
GACACTCAA-3′ -MGB (nucleotides 1213–1243). Forward and reverse primers
were used at 250 nM in the reaction, and the probe at 200 nM. The limit of
detection for our One-step RT-PCR quantification assay was approximately 100
genomes making the limit of detection in bodily fluids 1e4 for 100 µl of plasma or
urine and 1/10th of the RNA recovered used per reaction. The limit of detection in
tissues was ~400 genomes per µg total RNA using 250 ng total RNA per reaction.
Isolation of placental immune cells and trophoblasts. At the time of necropsy,
~0.5–1 g of decidua and villous tissue were collected and stored in 5 mL of HBSS
supplemented with 2% FBS and 10 mM Hepes (HBSS + ), for flow cytometry
analysis. Tissues were dissected into a fine slurry using forceps and scissors prior to
being digested with collagenase, 50 mg collagenase in 35 mL HBSS + , for 30 min at
37 °C, with rocking. Digested tissues were washed with HBSS + and run through a
70 μM filter. The cells present in the flow through were pelleted by centrifugation at
500 × g. Red blood cells were lysed in the cell pellet with BD Pharm Lyse lysing
buffer (BD Biosciences). After a final wash in HBSS + , cells were resuspended in
5 mL HBSS + and counted using a hemocytometer. Cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry as described below.
To evaluate placental infection by ZIKV, villous trophoblasts were isolated from
the placentas of three animals (D27428, D27427 and D28380) essentially according
to the method of Kliman et al.63. Briefly, villous tissue (30–35 g) that had been
dissected free of membranes was washed, minced, filtered through sterile gauze and
digested with three rounds of incubation in a trypsin-DNase solution (0.25%
trypsin [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO] in PBS with 0.5 mg/ml DNase 1 [Sigma;
2000 Kunitz units/mg]). Digested tissue was collected, layered over newborn calf
serum (NCS; Sigma) at a 5:1 v/v ratio and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cell
pellets were resuspended in DMEM and the mononuclear cytotrophoblast
population was isolated by centrifugation on a preformed Percoll gradient
(10–70%) with collection of cells banding between 35–55%. Recovered cells were
washed and plated on 35 mm Corning Primaria tissue culture dishes (Thermo-
Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA) in 1:1 DMEM/Hams F12 (Thermo-Fisher
Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics
(Penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin). Cells were cultured for 3 days post plating
(pp) with medium exchange every 24 h. Supernatants were harvested at days 1, 2,
and 3 pp and evaluated for the presence of infectious ZIKV by titration on Vero
cells. Monolayers were used immediately after each supernatant collection on days
1–3pp for immunofluorescence detection of ZIKV antigen. Briefly, cells were
washed, fixed and permeabilized in 4% pFormaldehye followed by 0.2% Triton X-
100, blocked with 20% normal goat serum and sequentially incubated with an anti-
Flavivirus group antigen mAb (Clone D1–4G2) and a goat-anti-Mouse IgG Alexa-
Fluor 488 (Thermo-Fisher) secondary antibody.
Phenotypic analysis of peripheral blood and tissue mononuclear cells. Flow
cytometry was used to quantify the immune cell phenotype and level of cellular
proliferation and activation for maternal PBMCs isolated at the time points defined
above as well as the immune cells obtained from placental tissues. The panel of
antibodies used for the analysis of innate immune cells consisted of HLA-DR (G46–6
10 µg/mL Beckman Coulter), CD14 (HCD14 10 µg/mL Biolegend), CD11c (3.9 10
µg/mL Biolegend), CD123 (SSDCLY107D2 10 µg/mL Beckman Coulter), CD20
(B9E9 10 µg/mL Beckman Coulter), CD3 (SP34-2 2 µg/mL Biolegend), CD8 (SK-1
10 µg/mL BD Bioscience), CD16 (3G8 10 µg/mL ThermoFisher), and CD169 (7–329
2 µg/mL Biolegend). To differentiate between monocyte/macrophages, dendritic cells
(DC), and natural killer (NK) cells the following gating strategy was utilized:
monocyte/macrophages (CD3−CD20−CD14+HLA-DR+), classical monocytes (CD3-
CD20- HLA-DR+ CD14+CD16−), intermediate monocytes (CD3−CD20− HLA-DR+
CD14+CD16+), non-classical monocytes CD3−CD20− HLA-DR+ CD14−CD16+),
DC (CD3−CD20−CD14−HLA-DR+), myeloid DCs (CD3−CD20−CD14−HLA-DR+
CD123−), CD11c+ plasmacytoid DCs (CD3−CD20−CD14−HLA-DR+CD123+CD11c
−), other DCs (CD3−CD20−CD14−HLA-DR+CD123−CD11c−), and NK cells (CD3
−CD20−CD8+CD16+). The percentage of activated cells (CD169+) within each subset
was calculated as a representation of the cellular activation profile. T cells were
analyzed with the following panel of antibodies directed against CD3 (SP34-2 2 µg/
mL Biolegend), CD4 (L200 5 µg/mL Thermofisher), CD8β (SK-1 10 µg/mL BD
Bioscience), CD95 (DX2 2 µg/mL BD Biosciences), CD28 (CD28.2 2 µg/ml Biole-
gend) and the intracellular proliferation marker Ki67 (20Raj1 2 µg/ml, Thermo-
fisher). CD3+ T cells were first identified as CD4+ or CD8+; within the CD4+ and
CD8+ T-cell subsets the naive (CD28+CD95−), central memory (CD28+CD95+), and
effector memory (CD28−CD95+) subsets were analyzed. B cells were stained using
the following antibodies: CD20 (B9E9 5 µg/ml Beckman Coulter), CD27 O323 5 µg/
mL Biolegend), and IgD (Goat polyclonal 2 µg/mL Southern Biotech) to delineate
naive (CD20+CD27−IgD+), memory (CD20+CD27−IgD−) and marginal-zone like B
cells (CD20+CD27+IgD+) as well as Ki67 to identify recent proliferating cells. The
percentage of proliferating (Ki67+) B and T cells within each subset was calculated.
The gating strategies were performed as previously described64. Phenotyping was
performed using an LSRII instrument (BD Bioscience) and the data were analyzed
with FlowJo Software (TreeStar).
ZIKV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-ZIKV antibodies
were measured by ELISA in the maternal and fetal plasma as well as in the cord
blood (venous and arterial) and amniotic fluid. High-binding polystyrene 96-well
plates (Corning) were coated overnight with 100 µl of PBS containing a 1:100
dilution of purified ZIKV particle preparations. The plates were blocked with PBS
containing 2% milk and 0.05% Tween (ELISA-Block) for 1 h at room temperature,
washed with 0.05% Tween-PBS (ELISA-Wash), and incubated with two-fold
dilutions of rhesus plasma in ELISA-Block starting at a dilution of 1:50. The plate
was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were washed several times with
ELISA-Wash and then incubated with secondary anti-monkey IgM/A/G (Rock-
land, Inc.) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 30 mins. Plates were washed
with ELISA-Wash and bound secondary antibody was detected using the OPD
substrate (Life Technologies) with an HCl stop. The plates were read within 10 min
using a Synergy HTX Microplate Reader (BioTeck) at 490 nm. Dilution titers of
ZIKV-binding antibodies were determined using a Log-to-Log transformation
method and the results were graphed using GraphPad Prism v6 software.
Anti-ZIKV neutralization assay. Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT50)
was used to measure the concentration of serum that neutralizes 50% of a fixed
number of ZIKV-PRABC59. NHP serum from the dam and fetus, cord blood, and
amniotic fluid was serially diluted 2-fold from starting dilutions of 1:10 and mixed
with an equal volume of a fixed number of plaque forming units (50 PFU) of ZIKV
for final serum dilutions ranging from 1:40 to 1:81,920. Sera and virus were
incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixtures were added to individual wells of 12-well
plates seeded with Vero cells at 90% confluence for 1 h at 37 °C on a rocker and
then overlaid with DMEM containing methylcellulose. Plates were incubated for
3 days and then fixed and counterstained with methyl blue. Plaques were counted
and PRNT50 values were calculated utilizing the sigmoid dose-response curve

Cytokine assay. Luminex monkey Cytokine Magnetic 29-plex panel (Invitrogen)
was used to quantify cytokine and chemokine expression in maternal blood and
fetal (circulation and venous/arterial cord blood) plasma, amniotic fluid and CSF
samples. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, washed antibody-conjugated polystyrene magnetic beads were incubated
with a 7-point standard curve or 25 µl of rhesus monkey plasma or CSF plus 25 µL
of blocking buffer, and incubated 2 h. Beads were washed with wash buffer and
labeled with the biotinylated detector antibody for 1 h. Beads were washed and then
incubated with Streptavidin conjugated to R-Phycoerythrin for 30 min and washed.
Cytokines were identified and quantified using a Luminex 200TM Detection system
(Luminex) and data was graphed using GraphPad Prism v6 software.
Doppler ultrasonography. Standard Doppler ultrasound measurements for uter-
oplacental hemodynamics were performed by one ultrasonographer (AEF) as
previously published for use with macaques41,43,65–67. Briefly, image-directed
pulsed and color Doppler equipment (GE Voluson 730 Expert) with a 5-to9-MHz
sector probe was used for ultrasonographic data collection. Blood velocity wave-
forms were obtained from the maternal uterine artery (UtA) and umbilical artery
to calculate their pulsatility index (PI = [peak systolic velocity—end diastolic
velocity]/time-averaged maximum velocity over the cardiac cycle) values. The
mean velocity from the intra-abdominal umbilical vein (UV) was also obtained.
The diameter of the uterine artery and intra-abdominal umbilical vein was
obtained as previously described and utilized to calculate the uterine artery volume
blood flow and umbilical vein volume blood flow41,43,65. Fetal head and abdominal
circumference (HC, AC), bipartiel diameter (BPD) and femur length (FL) was
assessed by ultrasonography to monitor potenial pertubationas in normal fetal
growth and development (microcephaly or calcifications in the fetal brain and
placenta).
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound. At gestational day 135, following an overnight
fast, animals were sedated by intramuscular injection with 10 mg/kg Ketamine.
Animals were then intubated and maintained under anesthesia with 1–2% inhaled
isoflurane gas for the duration of each imaging study. Contrast-enhanced ultra-
sound was performed using a multiphase amplitude-modulation and phase-
inversion algorithm on a Sequoia system (Siemens Medical Systems, Mountain
View, CA) as previously described in detail47. Lipid-shelled octofluoropropane
microbubble contrast reagent (Definity®, Lantheus Medical Imaging, Billerica, MA)
was prepared in 0.9% saline at a final concentration of 5% for intravenous infusion
via a cephalic catheter. The acoustic beam was centered over individually identified
maternal spiral artery sources and the microbubbles within the path of the beam
were destroyed by a brief (2 s) increase in mechanical index. Microbubble re-entry
in the spiral artery and the IVS was recorded at 1 frame /75 ms until the area of
interest reached signal saturation (VImax). Digital video clips were recorded for
10 s durations to measure video intensity (VI) of the blood pool (VIpool). Three
replicates of all recordings were obtained during each study. The digital imaging
data were analyzed using a custom-designed CE-US analysis program as previously
described47. In brief, regions of interest were drawn over the area of each placental
cotyledon. The data were fit to the function y = A(1-e-βt), where y is the VI at the
pulsing interval t, A is the VI plateau and β is the flux rate constant. A one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparison test was used to compare
microvascular flux rate data.
Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies were performed on a nonhuman
primate-dedicated 3T Siemens TIM-Trio scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using a
circularly-polarized (CP) transmit, 15-channel receive radiofrequency (RF)
“extremity” coil (QED, Cleveland, OH). ZIKV animals were transported under
1–2% inhaled isoflurane immediately from the ultrasound studies to the MRI
facility. For fetal brain imaging, a half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-
echo (HASTE) sequence was used to acquire T2-weighted volumes (T2W) along
the axial direction (relative to fetal brain). Four averages of T2W volumes were
collected with TR/TE = 1200/102 ms at a resolution of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.8 mm. A dif-
fusion-weighted, 2D spin-echo-based EPI sequence was used to acquire one image
volume with b = 0 (the “b0” volume) and 20 diffusion-weighted volumes with b =
500 s/mm2 along the fetal axial direction. Up to 6 averages of b0 and diffusion-
weighted volumes were acquired with a resolution of 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.7 mm. Apparent
diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were calculated from b0 and diffusion-weighted
volumes using the “DTIFIT” function within FSL software package (https://fsl.
fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki). T2W volumes and ADC maps of ZIKV-infected animals
were linearly registered to a T2W template and an ADC map template, respectively.
The T2W template was generated from 16 control animals at gestational age G135
± 2d, and the ADC map template was generated from 8 control animals at the
same gestation age range (manuscript in preparation). For an animal shown
abnormal gyral folding pattern and an age-matched control, 3D cortical surface
models of the fetal brains were generated from manual segmentations of T2W
volumes using CARET software (http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Caret).
Cortical surface curvature (a metric for brain folding) were computed and rendered
onto the 3D surfaces. Cortical gyri have positive curvatures (Fig. 7, warm colors)
and sulci have negative curvatures (Fig. 7, cold colors). For placental MRI, fol-
lowing localization of the placenta and acquisition of T2-weighted HASTE ana-
tomic images in the coronal and axial planes, axial 2D multislice multiecho spoiled
gradient echo (SPGR) images spanning the entire uterus, were acquired as pre-
viously described in detail36,37. Subsequently, 3D SPGR images were acquired in
the coronal plane, also covering the entire uterus, to allow estimation of T1
(longitudinal relaxation time) using the variable flip angle (VFA) method37.
Immediately after acquisition of VFA data, 150 volumes of 3D SPGR images were
acquired for DCE-MRI with intravenous injection of a standard dose of 0.1 mmol/
kg of gadoteridol CR (Prohance, Bracco Diagnostics Inc, Princeton, NJ) at a rate of
30 mL/min using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), followed by
3D post-contrast SPGR imaging. Anatomic and multiecho imaging was performed
during expiratory breath-holding, achieved by temporarily suspending ventilation,
while the DCE-MRI data were acquired during ventilation. Physiological mon-
itoring of pulse rate, arterial blood oxygen saturation, and end-tidal CO2 partial
pressure was performed throughout the imaging study, with no deviations from
normal ranges observed in these parameters. Immediately following MRI, the
animals were transported to the ONPRC Surgical Services Unit for Cesarean sec-
tion. Subsequent to necropsy, the right hemisphere was immersion fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and imaged in phosphate-buffered saline following previously
described methods37.
Histological analysis of placental tissue. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
tissue blocks representative of the placenta (8–11 separate 0.5 cm3 samples/pla-
centa) and the placental bed emphasizing grossly visible spiral arteries
(3–4 separate biopsies per case) provided hematoxylin and eosins stained (H&E)
histologic sections for review by a gynecologic pathologist. Sections from five ZIKV
cases and three gestational age-matched negative controls (135dGA) were reviewed
while blinded to exposure group scoring for the presence or absence of placental
infarctions, accelerated villous maturation, villous stromal calcifications, chronic
villitis, acute chorioamnionitis, chronic decidualitis (highlighted by CD138, B-A38
cat#760-4248) immunostaining of plasma cells), and macrophage subtyping by
CD68 (M1, KP-1 cat#790-2931) and CD163 (M2, MRQ-26 cat#760-4437) in villi
and decidua. Antibodies were received pre-diluted (and ready for use and
immunostains were performed on a Benchmark XT autostainer (Ventana Medical
Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA). The number of plasma cells and macrophage subtypes
were scored as number per high power field (40× objective) and reported as the
average of the four most populated fields. Complete cross-sections of decidual
spiral arteries were scored for normal luminal dilation and for the presence or
absence of vasculitis.
Fetal pathology. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks representative of
the fetal tissues were stained with H&E followed by microscopic examination.
Sections were reviewed by ONPRC veterinary pathologists.
