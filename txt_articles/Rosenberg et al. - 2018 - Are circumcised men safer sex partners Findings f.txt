Abstract
Introduction
The real-world association between male circumcision and HIV status has important impli-
cations for policy and intervention practice. For instance, women may assume that circum-
cised men are safer sex partners than non-circumcised men and adjust sexual partnering
and behavior according to these beliefs. Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is
highly efficacious in preventing HIV acquisition in men and this biological efficacy should
lead to a negative association between circumcision and HIV. However, behavioral factors
such as differential selection into circumcision based on current HIV status or factors associ-
ated with future HIV status could reverse the association. Here, we examine how HIV preva-
lence differs by circumcision status in older adult men in a rural South African community, a
non-experimental setting in a time of expanding VMMC access.
Methods
We analyzed data collected from a population-based sample of 2345 men aged 40 years
and older in a rural community served by the Agincourt Health and socio-Demographic Sur-
veillance System site in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. We describe circumcision
prevalence and estimate the association between circumcision and laboratory-confirmed
HIV status with log-binomial regression models.
Results
One quarter of older men reported circumcision, with slightly more initiation-based circumci-
sions (56%) than hospital-based circumcisions (44%). Overall, the evidence did not suggest

within the Agincourt Health and socio-
Demographic Surveillance System, with funding
from The Wellcome Trust (058893/Z/99/A;
069683/Z/02/Z; 085477/Z/08/Z; 085477/B/08/Z),

Research Council, South Africa. TB received
 differences in HIV prevalence between circumcised and uncircumcised men; however,
those who reported hospital-based circumcision were more likely to test HIV-positive [PR
(95% CI): 1.28 (1.03, 1.59)] while those who reported initiation-based circumcision were
less likely to test HIV-positive [PR (95% CI): 0.68 (0.51, 0.90)]. Effects were attenuated, but
not reversed after adjustment for key covariates.
Conclusions
Medically circumcised older men in a rural South African community had higher HIV preva-
lence than uncircumcised men, suggesting that the effect of selection into circumcision may
be stronger than the biological efficacy of circumcision in preventing HIV acquisition. The
impression given from circumcision policy and dissemination of prior trial findings that those
who are circumcised are safer sex partners may be incorrect in this age group and needs to
be countered by interventions, such as educational campaigns.
Introduction
Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is highly efficacious in preventing HIV acqui-
sition in men.[1–4] In South Africa, where HIV incidence has been extremely high over the
past three decades, national guidelines recommend that all men who test HIV-negative be
offered a comprehensive prevention package that includes information on and referral to
VMMC services, and that “the success of testing programs should be measured by the number
of individuals successfully linked to. . .medical male circumcision services for HIV-negative
males.”[5]
However, little is known about the current differences in HIV prevalence by circumcision
status in real-world, non-clinical trial settings. The evidence justifying VMMC trials came
from a body of observational studies demonstrating lower HIV prevalence among traditionally
circumcised men.[6] It is unknown if this association differs after years of expanding VMMC
access when the decision to undergo the procedure may relate to current HIV status or factors
associated with future HIV status, and specifically whether these kinds of selection effects
could be strong enough to outweigh the protective biological effect of VMMC. One message
transmitted by current VMMC policy and the proven protective effect of VMMC is that cir-
cumcised men are less likely to be HIV-positive. There is emerging potential for female part-
ners, who report preference for circumcision in part due to perceptions about HIV status,[7,8]
to change their sexual behaviors in response to this assumption.[9,10] The implications for
HIV risk rest on whether or not this assumption is founded.
There is also little known about male circumcision acceptability and uptake among older
men in South Africa. In younger and general population South African and sub-Saharan Afri-
can men, circumcision is generally perceived positively, with the link between circumcision
and HIV/STI prevention cited as an important reason to become circumcised.[11–13] Older
men, who are often overlooked as targets for HIV prevention interventions due to incorrect
assumptions about their lack of sexual risk-taking,[14,15] and who came of age prior to
VMMC recommendations for HIV prevention, may have different circumcision attitudes and
patterns of circumcision uptake. Further, circumcision associated with traditional initiation
ceremonies marking the rite of passage from childhood to adulthood is relatively common
among Black South Africans and is more prevalent among older men than younger men.[16]

 In this paper, we aim to fill persistent knowledge gaps related to male circumcision in older
men in sub-Saharan Africa. First, we describe the prevalence of male circumcision in the pop-
ulation and identify socio-demographic predictors of being circumcised in a sample of men 40
years and older from a rural South African community. Then, we model the association
between circumcision status and prevalent HIV infection to provide insight into how HIV
prevalence differs by circumcision status in a non-experimental setting in a time of expanding
VMMC access.
Methods
Study population
This analysis uses data from the population-based Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal
Study of an INDEPTH Community in South Africa (HAALSI) study that aims to characterize
a community of older men and women in rural South Africa with respect to health, physical
and cognitive function, aging, and well-being. Adults age 40 and older were sampled from the
existing framework of the Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance System
(Agincourt HDSS)[17] in Mpumalanga province, northeast South Africa, and visited at home
between November 2014 and November 2015. Extensive survey and laboratory data were col-
lected to assess physical and cognitive functioning, cardiometabolic health, economic well-
being, and HIV and HIV risk.
Ethical approval for HAALSI was obtained from the University of the Witwatersrand
Human Research Ethics Committee (#M141159), the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public
Health Office of Human Research Administration (#13–1608), and the Mpumalanga Provin-
cial Research and Ethics Committee. All participants provided written informed consent to
participate in the HAALSI study with consent procedures approved by the three ethical com-
mittees mentioned above.
Key measures
Trained, local fieldworkers collected survey data electronically using Computer Assisted
Personal Interviews (CAPI). Surveys were conducted in the local language, Shangaan, with
instruments translated from English and back-translated to ensure accurate translation. Cir-
cumcision status was ascertained with the question: “Has your foreskin been removed?”
Among those who responded affirmatively to the circumcision question, age at circumcision
(ages 0–13 14–18, and 19+) and type of circumcision (hospital-based or initiation-based cir-
cumcision) were queried. Although an ‘other’ response option for type of circumcision was
available, all circumcised men self-selected into either ‘initiation’ or ‘hospital’ categories. For
this reason, these are the only categories we used.
In addition to the survey, fieldworkers collected blood via finger prick from those who con-
sented. Dried bloodspots were prepared and later tested for HIV. Laboratory-confirmed HIV
status was determined through screening and confirmatory HIV enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assays conducted using standard laboratory practices on the prepared dried bloodspots.
[18]
Statistical analysis
Given the proven biological efficacy of VMMC, we hypothesized that circumcised men would
have lower HIV prevalence than uncircumcised men, and that lower HIV prevalence would be
explained by those receiving hospital-based circumcisions and circumcisions at younger ages.
We used log-binomial regression models to estimate the association between circumcision

 status and HIV status, with circumcision status stratified by age at circumcision and type of
circumcision, and then doubly stratified by age and type of circumcision. We chose log-bino-
mial regression models over logistic regression models because prevalence ratios from log-
binomial regression are generally more interpretable than odds ratios from logistic regression.
As a sensitivity analysis around our modeling decisions, we repeated our analyses using logistic
regression models.
We compared unadjusted estimates to estimates adjusted for age, in years; household asset
index quintiles; African traditional religion; marital status; country of origin; formal education
(any versus none); and number of lifetime sex partners (0–1, 2–4, or 5+). This study does not
seek to re-examine the established causal relationship between VMMC and reduced HIV risk.
Instead, we were interested in how circumcision and HIV prevalence are associated in a real-
world setting of older men, in which decisions to undergo circumcision procedures could
plausibly be related to HIV status and/or HIV risk. Thus, the unadjusted analyses of the associ-
ation between circumcision and HIV are the primary results of interest in this study. The
adjusted analyses provide evidence for whether these population-level estimates can be
explained by the inclusion of key covariates. All analyses were conducted using SAS statistical
software, version 9.4.[19]
Results
Of the 2345 men enrolled in the study, 68% were currently married, 41% reported no formal
education, 11% reported African/traditional religious affiliation, and 29% were of Mozambi-
can descent (Table 1). Median age was 61 years with interquartile range between 52 and 71
years.
One quarter of the men reported circumcision; of them, over half (56%) were circumcised
in traditional initiation-based circumcision ceremonies while 44% were circumcised in hospi-
tal-based procedures. Those who reported hospital-based circumcision were younger, less
likely to be widowed, more likely to have higher educational attainment, more likely to identify
with Christian or Islamic religion, less likely to be of Mozambican descent, and more likely to
live in a household in the highest wealth quintile, compared to those who were uncircumcised.
Those who reported initiation-based circumcision were older, less likely to be married, more
likely to have higher educational attainment, and less likely to be of Mozambican descent,
compared to those who were uncircumcised.
Nearly a quarter of circumcised men (23%) were circumcised in childhood or early adoles-
cence (before age 14), 36% were circumcised during adolescence (age 14–18), and 41% were
circumcised in adulthood (age 19 or older). As expected, those who reported hospital-based
circumcisions were more likely to report circumcision in adulthood compared to those who
reported initiation-based circumcision.
Overall, laboratory-confirmed HIV prevalence among HAALSI men was 23% (95% CI: 21,
25), with no evidence for differences between uncircumcised men [24% (95% CI: 22, 26)] and
circumcised men [23% (95% CI: 19, 27)] (Table 2 and Fig 1). HIV prevalence was lowest
among those who reported an initiation-based circumcision [16% (95% CI: 12, 21)], higher
among those who did not report circumcision [24% (95% CI: 22, 26)], and highest among
those who reported a hospital-based circumcision [31% (95% CI: 25, 37)]. After adjustment, a
protective association between traditional circumcision and HIV prevalence remained [PR
(95% CI): 0.73 (0.54, 0.98)], and the association between hospital-based circumcision and
heightened HIV prevalence was smaller in magnitude [PR (95% CI): 1.11 (0.88, 1.40)] with
confidence interval spanning the null. No clear pattern emerged in HIV prevalence by age at
circumcision in adjusted or unadjusted analyses; however, those who were circumcised

 between the ages of 14 to 18 years were the least likely to test HIV-positive [18% (95% CI: 13,
25)], compared to those who were circumcised at age 13 years or younger [23% (95% CI: 17,
33)], and those who were circumcised after age 18 [27% (95% CI: 21, 34)]. HIV prevalence did
not vary significantly by age at circumcision when stratified by circumcision type.
Sensitivity analysis
Because nearly all Muslims are circumcised for religious reasons, we excluded the small Mus-
lim population (n = 2) from the sample and repeated our analyses. As expected, all of our
results remained nearly identical to the main analyses shown in the paper. Odds ratios from
logistic regression models were similar in magnitude and direction to the prevalence ratios cal-
culated in our primary analysis (S1 Table).
Discussion
In this analysis of population-based data on older men in rural South Africa, we examined cir-
cumcision history and the association between circumcision and HIV status in the current cir-
cumcision landscape. We found that one quarter of older men reported being circumcised,
with slightly more than half of circumcisions reported as traditional initiation-based proce-
dures as opposed to medical procedures. This circumcision prevalence is lower than the 2012
national estimate of 46% in men age 15 and older, but in line with findings indicating tradi-
tional circumcisions are more common than medical circumcision.[20] We also found that

 the demographic profile of those who were uncircumcised differed substantially from those
with hospital-based circumcisions and those with initiation-based circumcisions. We found
no differences in HIV prevalence by circumcision status overall, and that men with hospital-
based circumcisions were more likely to test HIV-positive compared to both uncircumcised
men and men with traditional initiation-based circumcision.
That hospital-based circumcision was not associated with lower HIV prevalence differs
from the findings we expected based on (i) the national policy on selection of HIV-negative
men for VMMC, (ii) the protective effect of VMMC on HIV acquisition, and (iii) the protec-
tive association we observed between traditional initiation-based circumcision and HIV. A
large body of observational studies from the pre-VMMC era established that traditionally cir-
cumcised men were less likely to be HIV-positive. A systematic review of 27 studies[6]
reported a protective effect in nearly all of the unadjusted analyses, with strengthened associa-
tions after covariate adjustment. In population-based, cross-sectional studies like ours, the
overall protective effect was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.54), slightly stronger than our estimate for
traditionally circumcised men, but in contrast to our estimate for medically circumcised men.
Of course, our findings are plausible despite the high biological efficacy of medical circum-
cision in preventing HIV acquisition in men. The most likely explanation is that HIV-positive
older men are circumcised in clinical settings in larger numbers than HIV-negative men,
counter to the South African policy to target HIV-negative men with circumcision informa-
tion and referral. One plausible pathway for this explanation is that HIV-positive men are

 more engaged in care than their HIV-negative counterparts, and circumcision services could
be one of the clinical services to which they have more access.
Another possible explanation is that men who engage in riskier sexual behavior self-select
into VMMC, resulting in heightened risk for subsequent HIV infection. Although no significant
differences were observed by age at circumcision, HIV prevalence was highest among men who
were circumcised in the oldest age category (after age 18). One possible explanation for this
finding is that in adulthood men with higher than average risk of HIV acquisition chose to be
circumcised but that no such selection effect existed in childhood. However, this explanation
requires the perhaps improbable assumption that the risk behaviors among the circumcised
confer risk at a magnitude able to overcome the otherwise protective circumcision effect.
Similarly, it is possible that older men engage in riskier sexual behavior after circumcision
because they know that they are now at substantially reduced risk for HIV acquisition. However,
this explanation is unlikely as there has been no evidence for this kind of risk compensation in
prior circumcision studies in Africa,[21–26] and the magnitude of risk compensation that would
have had to occur in our study population to bias the otherwise protective effect to become a sig-
nificant association on the other side of the null is likely implausibly large. The possibility also
exists for risk compensation in men with traditional initiation-based circumcision if they had
been informed of the protective effects of circumcision. While risk compensation is unlikely to be
the only explanation of the observed association between circumcision and HIV status in this
study, it could have contributed to some extent to our findings, warranting further research on
quantifying the level of risk compensation in communities similar to the study community.
Several features of the data structure and quality call for our findings be interpreted with
caution. First, we used self-reported circumcision status with no objective examination to con-
firm true circumcision status, which could lead to biased results if men were unwilling or
unable to accurately report their true circumcision status. Second, the data were cross-sec-
tional in design so we were unable to disentangle the temporal relationship between circumci-
sion and HIV status. Plausible bidirectional mechanisms exist and we were not able to assess
their relative contributions given the rough categorization of age at circumcision and
unknown date of HIV seroconversion. Finally, these data were collected in a sample of older
men in a rural South African community. Generalizability of these results to younger men or
men in more urban settings may not be possible.
Our findings are important for HIV prevention policy in South Africa for several reasons.
First, among older men in rural South Africa, there remain many HIV-negative uncircumcised
men who could receive HIV prevention benefits from VMMC as part of a comprehensive HIV
prevention package promoting safer sexual practices tailored to the particular needs of older
adults. Expansion of VMMC services to target older men with referrals could help address this
unmet need. Second, the policy to target HIV-negative men with VMMC is likely not complied
with in real-world settings as HIV prevalence was higher among medically circumcised men than
among uncircumcised men. It is plausible that this policy, coupled with the widely-known pro-
tective effect of VMMC, gives the false impression that circumcised men are safer sex partners. If
HIV-positive men actually take up the procedure at high rates, the promotion of VMMC as a
procedure for HIV-negative men to prevent HIV may have the unintended consequence of
increasing HIV transmission at the population-level. To reduce this risk, modifications of the
existing VMMC policies and associated public engagement campaigns should be considered.
Conclusions
Medically circumcised older men in rural South Africa had higher HIV prevalence than uncir-
cumcised men, despite the biological efficacy of VMMC and the South African policy explicitly

 targeting HIV-negative men for circumcision. This finding suggests that the association
between circumcision and HIV status may be more strongly driven by selection into circumci-
sion than the biological efficacy of circumcision in preventing HIV acquisition. The impres-
sion given from circumcision policy and dissemination of prior trial findings that those who
are circumcised are safer sex partners may be incorrect in this age group.
