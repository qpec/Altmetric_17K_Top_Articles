Hallmarks of chronic neurodegenerative disease include progressive synaptic loss and neuronal cell death, yet the
cellular pathways that underlie these processes remain largely undefined. We provide evidence that dual leucine
zipper kinase (DLK) is an essential regulator of the progressive neurodegeneration that occurs in amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease. We demonstrate that DLK/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling was increased in
mouse models and human patients with these disorders and that genetic deletion of DLK protected against axon
degeneration, neuronal loss, and functional decline in vivo. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of DLK activity
was sufficient to attenuate the neuronal stress response and to provide functional benefit even in the presence of
ongoing disease. These findings demonstrate that pathological activation of DLK is a conserved mechanism that
regulates neurodegeneration and suggest that DLK inhibition may be a potential approach to treat multiple
neurodegenerative diseases.
INTRODUCTION
The progressive degeneration of neurons underlies a range of diseases,
such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), for which there are no disease-modifying treatments. Although
recent advances in human genetics have identified causative factors in
neurodegenerative disease (1, 2), the pathways induced within neurons
in response to these triggers are still poorly understood. Furthermore,
most clinical cases of ALS and AD are sporadic, with no clear definable
cause. A better understanding of how neurons respond to chronic stress
may reveal common links between neurodegenerative diseases and sug-
gest therapeutic avenues to modify disease progression regardless of the
initial insult.
Recent work has identified the neuron-enriched kinase dual leucine
zipper kinase (DLK) as an integrator of many types of neuronal injury,
suggesting that this kinase may be a conserved driver of neuronal de-
generation (3–8). DLK is required for initiation of the c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK)–dependent stress response in neurons and broadly regu-
lates injury-induced transcriptional changes (3, 5). Neurons lacking
DLK expression are protected against axon degeneration and neuronal
apoptosis, both during healthy development and in response to diverse
neuronal insults (3–8). DLK also supports regeneration in invertebrate
models and in permissive environments in mouse, such as peripheral
nerve injury (5, 9–12). In all of these scenarios, DLK functions as an
injury sensor that regulates the neuronal stress response, with the adop-
tion of proapoptotic and proregenerative outcomes depending on the
specific cellular context (5). The central role of DLK in response to neu-
ronal injury suggests that pharmacological inhibition of this kinase may
be beneficial in chronic neurodegenerative disease, but this has yet to be
tested experimentally in progressive disease models.
Inhibition of JNK pathway signaling downstream of DLK has been
shown to slow neuronal degeneration in some contexts (13), but it has
proved challenging to generate brain-penetrant compounds that safely
and effectively target specific JNK isoforms (14). DLK inhibition may
have similar benefits, and the development of selective, brain-penetrant
DLK inhibitors suggests that it represents a more tractable therapeutic
target (15, 16). Here, we demonstrate that loss or inhibition of DLK
signalingrapidlyreversedthe neuronalstressresponsein severalchronic
neurodegenerative disease models even if initiated after disease onset.
Halting this stress response prolonged neuronal survival, preserved
synapses, and improved cognitive and motor function in mouse models
of ALS and AD.
RESULTS
The JNK pathway is activated in central nervous system
tissues from mouse models and patients with ALS or AD
To ascertain whetheractivation of the DLK/JNK pathway contributes to
chronic neurodegenerative disease, we first examined whether aberrant

 JNK signaling occurs in the context of progressive neurodegeneration.
Phosphorylation of both JNK and the downstream target c-Jun was
examined, with a particular focus on phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun)
because it is a specific marker of stress-induced JNK activity in neurons
(4, 5, 17–20). In the SOD1G93A transgenic mouse model of familial ALS
(21, 22), we found an age-dependent increase in p-c-Jun–positive cells
in lumbar spinal cord of SOD1G93A transgenic mice between 9 and
14 weeks of age, with little staining in nontransgenic (nonTg) littermate
controls (Fig. 1, A and B), consistent with previous reports (17, 18).
Costaining for the neuronal marker NeuN (Fig. 1C) revealed that
p-c-Jun staining was almost entirely neuronal, with 94 of 100 p-c-
Jun–positive cells also expressing NeuN (fig. S2F). Moreover, p-c-Jun
costainedwithcholineacetyltransferase(ChAT)–positivemotorneurons,
whicharesusceptibletodeathinthisALSdiseasemousemodel(fig.S1A).
Dlk mRNA localized to cells expressing the pan-neuronal marker
Tubb3 (Fig. 1D and fig. S1B) and the motor neuron marker Chat
(fig. S1C), implying that DLK activity could be driving the phosphoryl-
ation of c-Jun in neurons. The number of p-c-Jun–positive cells was also
increased in the cortex of a second ALS model, the TDP-43A315T
transgenic mouse (Fig. 1, H and I) (23). Many components of the
JNK signaling pathway, including phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), p-c-
Jun, total JNK, and total c-Jun, were increased in lumbar spinal cord
lysates from patients with sporadic ALS (Fig. 1, E to G), suggesting that
activation of the JNK pathway occurs in the human disease and is not
limited to ALS caused by SOD1 mutations.
JNK pathway activity was also elevated in two transgenic mouse
strains that model specific aspects of AD, PS2APP and TauP301L
(24–26), at ages greater than 6 months (Fig. 2, A to D, and fig. S2, A
to D). p-c-Jun was detected almost exclusively within NeuN-positive
cells in both PS2APP mice and TauP301L mice (fig. S2, E and F), indicat-
ingthattheaberrantJNKpathwayactivitywassimilarlylimitedtoneurons
in these models. In postmortem central nervous system (CNS) tissues
from patients with either early-stage AD or confirmed AD, p-c-Jun
immunostaining was significantly elevated in hippocampal neurons
(Fig. 2, E and F; P < 0.01), consistent with previous findings (27, 28). To
determine whether the presence of aberrant JNK activity correlated with
the extent of disease pathology, we examined p-c-Jun, total c-Jun, and
p-JNKincontrol,early-stageAD,andconfirmedADpatientsuperiorfron-
tal gyrus, a brain region affected predominantly in the later stages of AD
(29). In these samples, increased JNK activity was observed only in con-
firmed AD but not in early AD postmortem brain samples (Fig. 2, G to I).
Expression of p-JNK and p-c-Jun in these samples correlated well with the
presence of phosphorylated pathogenic Tau (pS202 and pS396/S404)
(Fig. 2, G to I and fig. S2, G and H), suggesting that stress-induced JNK ac-
tivationoccursspecificallyinbrainregionswherediseasepathologyispresent.
Loss of DLK reduces JNK activity in animal models
of neurodegenerative disease
During development or after acute neuronal injury, DLK is required for
stress-induced JNK pathway activation and phosphorylation of c-Jun in
neurons(3–5, 10). To determine whetherthiswasthe case in the context
of progressive neurodegeneration, we crossed SOD1G93A, PS2APP, and
TauP301L mice with a DLK conditional knockout/CAAGS-CreERT
(DLKcKO) mouse (4). In this model, Dlk excision could be achieved in
adult mice by tamoxifen-induced Cre recombination, a strategy that
avoids potential developmental phenotypes and more accurately models
systemic DLK inhibitor treatment. In SOD1G93A;DLKcKO mice
administered tamoxifen from4 to 7 weeks of age, the Dlk recombination
efficiency was ~66 to 80% in lumbar spinal cord, as measured by quanti-
tative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (fig. S3A). Even thisincomplete
removal of DLK was able to reduce the number of p-c-Jun–positive
cells per section of the spinal cord by 47% in SOD1G93A;DLKcKO
mice compared to SOD1G93A;DLKWT littermates that lack the CreERT
transgene at 14 weeks of age (Fig. 3, A and B; P < 0.0001).
In the PS2APP and TauP301L mice, tamoxifen treatment was ini-
tiated at ~10 weeks of age and brain tissues were collected at 9 months
of age, after significant AD-related pathology had developed. Deletion
of Dlk reduced cortical DLK protein in both PS2APP;DLKcKO and
TauP301L;DLKcKO mice (~75 to 81%; Fig. 3, C, D, G, and H; P <
0.0001). This reduction in DLK expression was sufficient to significantly
reduce cortical p-c-Jun (~41 to 48%) and total c-Jun (~30%; Fig. 3, C, D,
G, and H; P < 0.0001) by Western blotting in both PS2APP;DLKcKOand
TauP301L;DLKcKO mice. The reduction in total c-Jun aligned with the
previous finding that inhibition of c-Jun phosphorylation reduces total
c-Jun expression (30). To confirm that the reductions in p-c-Jun re-
sulted from reduced DLK pathway activation, we measured the activity
oftwoupstreamcomponentsoftheDLK/JNKpathway,MKK4(mitogen-
activated protein kinase kinase 4) and JNK. Because neurons display
high basal activation of JNK and MKK4 that is not stress-dependent
or affected by DLK (4), less robust changes were observed in these
pathway markers after Dlk deletion. Small but significant reductions
in p-JNK (~11 to 18%) were observed in both models [Fig. 3, D (P <
0.05) and H (P < 0.01)], whereas phosphorylated MKK4 (p-MKK4) was
reduced in PS2APP;DLKcKO mice by ~30% but was unchanged in
TauP301L;DLKcKOmice[Fig.3,CandD(P<0.01),andGandH].Immuno-
staining forp-c-JunconfirmedthereductionsfoundbyWesternblotting:
the average number of p-c-Jun–positive cells per square millimeter was
significantly reduced throughout the brain in both PS2APP;DLKcKO
mice (by 69%; P < 0.0001) and TauP301L;DLKcKO mice (by 45%; Fig. 3,
E, F, I, and J; P < 0.0001). Together, these results demonstrate that loss
of DLK reduced stress-induced activation of the JNK pathway in three
independent animal models of chronic neurodegenerative disease.
Loss of DLK is neuroprotective in SOD1G93A transgenic mice
We next examined the impact of DLK removal on motor neuron sur-
vivalbycomparingthenumberofspinalcordmotorneuronsat14weeks
ofageinSOD1G93A;DLKWTmiceversusSOD1G93A;DLKcKOmice.Whereas
SOD1G93Amice with normal DLK expression showed the expected 40%
loss of ChAT-positive neurons compared to nonTg littermates, the
SOD1G93A;DLKcKO mice only lost 13% of ChAT-positive cells (Fig. 4,
A and B; P < 0.001). To determine whether motor neuron axons were
also protected in SOD1G93A;DLKcKO mice, we examined total axonal lu-
men area in cross sections of sciatic nerve. On the basis of the progres-
sion of axon degeneration pathology in SOD1G93A mice (31), this end
point provided the most robust measure at this age (14 weeks), because
a significant decrease in axon number has not yet occurred (fig. S3B).
Consistent with previous reports, axonal lumen area was decreased in
SOD1G93A mice, corresponding to the initial phase of axon degeneration
(Fig. 4, C and D; P < 0.001). A significant rescue in axonal lumen area was
observed in SOD1G93A;DLKcKO mice (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that Dlk
deletion was sufficient to elicit axonal protection. SOD1G93A;DLKcKO
animals also showed significant reductions in both ionized calcium
binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)–positive microglia and glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP)–positive astrocytes (Fig. 4, E and F, and fig. S3, C
and D; P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01, respectively). Because DLK expression is
enriched in neurons compared to glia (Fig. 1D and fig. S1B) (32), the
reduction in microglial and astrocytic activation suggested that unhealthy
neurons may be able to stimulate gliosis.

 To determine whether the protection of motor neurons after Dlk de-
letion would provide lasting functional benefit, we examined symptom
progressionandlifespaninanindependentcohortofSOD1G93A;DLKcKO
mice. We found that loss of DLK increased the median life span of
SOD1G93A;DLKcKO mice by 8 days compared to SOD1G93A mice
expressing wild-type DLK (Fig. 4G) while controlling for SOD1G93A
transgene copy number (fig. S4B) (33). Furthermore, SOD1G93A;
DLKcKO mice displayed improvements in functional outcomes (fig. S3,
E and F) (34), including the wire hang test, a measure of motor strength
(Fig. 4H and fig. S3G). Dlk deletion was well tolerated, with only minor
reductions in body weights (fig. S3, H and I).
Dlk deletion is beneficial in two mouse models of AD
In AD, reductions in dendritic spine densities are greatest within close
proximity to amyloid plaques (35), which can be recapitulated in mouse
models (24, 36–39). On the basis of previous work, this end point can
serve as an indicator of synaptic loss and provides a valuable measure of
degenerative processes because neuronal loss is not a common feature
of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse models of AD
(40, 41). Because DLK is present in the postsynaptic density and medi-
ates neuronal degeneration after excitotoxic injury (4), we sought to
determine whether plaque-associated synaptic loss is DLK-dependent
through measurement of synaptic spine densities after selective dele-
tion of Dlk from individual layer II/III neurons (4). Ex vivo imaging
found 30% less spine loss proximal to plaques in PS2APP;DLK null
neurons compared with PS2APP;DLK wild-type neurons (Fig. 5, A
and B), indicating that Ab/plaque-associated synaptic loss is at least
in part mediated by DLK signaling.
Becauselossofsynapticspinesisassociatedwithcognitivedeclineboth
inhumanADpatientsandinsomeanimalmodelsofAD(24,36–39,42,43),
we next compared cognitive function in >7-month-old PS2APP mice,
in which Dlk deletion was induced at 10 to 12 weeks of age. PS2APP
mice with intact DLK showed impairment in acquisition of active
avoidance behavior (Fig. 5C) (24, 36). However, loss of DLK expression
resulted in a complete rescue of the PS2APP phenotype, with the
PS2APP;DLKcKO mice performing equally as well as nonTg controls on
this task (Fig. 5C; P < 0.001). Spatial learning and memory were assessed
in the Morris water maze, but no significant PS2APP transgene–
dependent differences were found in this cohort of mice such that as-
sessment of DLK function wasnotpossible (fig. S5A). Fear-conditioning
acquisition and24-hour context fearmemory were also not significantly
different in PS2APP mice compared to nonTg controls (fig. S5, C to F).
However, an increased freezing response to an audible tone (cued
memory) was detected in PS2APP;DLKWT animals, which was rescued
in PS2APP;DLKcKO mice (fig. S5, G and H). These results demonstrate
that deletion of Dlk in young mice results in rescue of certain behavioral
phenotypes in PS2APP mice. To determine whether DLK removal
would have similar benefits after initiation of Ab/plaque deposition
and associated JNK/DLK pathway activation, we deleted Dlk at 6 months
of age in an independent cohort of PS2APP;DLKcKO mice (fig. S6A).
These mice showed improvement in the active avoidance learning
test (Fig. 5D; P < 0.01), suggesting that loss of DLK even subsequent
to activation of the DLK/JNK pathway may be sufficient to reverse
cognitive deficits in this task.
We next examined whether loss of DLK resulted in altered Ab/
plaque pathology in the PS2APP mice. Although synaptic spine density
and cognitive function were improved after Dlk deletion, Ab42 produc-
tion and plaque load were not reduced (fig. S6). At older ages, PS2APP;
DLKcKO mice had slightly higher levels of full-length APP, amyloid
plaques, and plaque-associated gliosis (fig. S6, B to K). These increases
were not a result of altered b-secretase 1 (BACE1) (fig. S6, E and F) but
could be explained by an aberrant up-regulation of hAPP expression
driven by the Thy1 (thymus cell antigen 1) promoter (fig. S6, E to G).
This observation was consistent with the previous finding that stress-
induced Thy1 down-regulation is prevented in DLKcKO mice (5), sug-
gesting that the increase in plaque pathology was specific to this mouse
model. APP expression changes in the PS2APP;DLKcKO mice were
specific to the Thy1-driven hAPP gene, whereas mAPP and prion
protein (PrP) promoter–driven expression of hPS2 were unaffected
(fig. S6, E to G).
To provide a second measure of AD-related neurodegeneration in a
model that displays more robust cell loss, we also assessed DLK function
in TauP301L mice. The amount of total and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau)
was unchanged at 15 months of age (fig. S7, A and B), suggesting that
loss of DLK did not alter Tau pathology. We found a significant atten-
uation of cell loss in the subiculum of TauP301L;DLKcKO mice (Fig. 5, E
and F; P < 0.05), a brain area that develops Tau pathology (44). Collect-
ively, the results from these three independent models of chronic
neurodegenerative disease demonstrate that Dlk deletion, even after
disease onset, results in increased neuronal survival, enhanced synaptic
integrity, and some functional benefits.
Treatment with DLK inhibitors is neuroprotective and can
reverse injury-induced changes in gene expression
Before examiningtheactivityoftwostructurallydistinctDLKinhibitors,
GNE-8505 (fig. S8) and GNE-3511 (15), in chronic neurodegenerative
disease mouse models, we first sought to better characterize the in vivo
activity of these compounds using an acute optic nerve crush model
where genetic deletion of Dlk or DLK inhibition before crush injury re-
duced injury-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun (15, 16). To determine
whetherDLKinhibitorsreducedp-c-Junwhenadministeredafterinjury,
we gave the animals a single dose of GNE-8505 18 hours after optic
nerve crush, and we measured the amount of p-c-Jun in mouse retina
at several time points. A single oral dose of GNE-8505 rapidly reduced
p-c-Jun in a dose-dependent fashion within 1 hour, a decrease that was
sustained for at least 6 hours (Fig. 6A). p-c-Jun repression correlated
with the plasma concentration of GNE-8505, allowing all time points
to be pooled to generate an in vivo dose-response curve (Fig. 6B).
The calculated in vivo half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) val-
ue of 0.98 ± 0.11 mM was consistent with the cellular IC50 for this com-
pound when corrected for protein binding (table S2) and suggested that
continuous DLK activity was required to maintain c-Jun phosphoryl-
ation (and, conversely, that repressing p-c-Jun would require sustained
DLK inhibition).
Previous microarray studies in DLKcKO mice revealed that DLK
signaling not only regulates c-Jun phosphorylation but is also required
for most of the injury-induced transcriptional changes after optic nerve
crush (5). To determine whether DLK inhibition has the same effect,
we gave the animals two doses of GNE-3511, starting at 3 days after
nerve crush, and we assessed DLK-dependent gene expression by RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq). As observed in previous studies (5), optic nerve
injury induced numerous gene expression changes in vehicle-treated
animals 3 days after injury. Just 12 hours of GNE-3511 treatment was
sufficient to attenuate many of the injury-induced gene expression
changes, with 148 up-regulated and 105 down-regulated genes demon-
strating DLK dependence (Fig. 6C; P < 0.05). The DLK dependence of
eight representative stress-induced genes, including Sprr1a, Atf3, Ddit3,
and Bbc3, was then confirmed in a distinct cohort of animals (fig. S9).

 To determine whether the reversal of injury-induced DLK signaling
was sufficient to elicit neuroprotection in the mouse retina, we ad-
ministered GNE-3511 twice daily for 3 days starting at 18 hours after
optic nerve crush. Treatment with DLK inhibitors resulted in a signif-
icant reduction in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis (by 96%; P =
0.0014) and maintenance of Brn3 expression (by 50%; P < 0.0001) in
RGCs 3 days after crush injury (Fig. 6, D to F). This demonstrated that
inhibition of DLK resulted in neuroprotection similar to that seen in
DLKcKO animals even when dosing was initiated after injury (5).
DLK inhibition is beneficial in a mouse model of ALS
We next sought to determine whether pharmacological inhibition of
DLK could have beneficial effects in a chronic neurodegenerative disease
mousemodel.These studiesfocusedlargelyon theSOD1G93Atransgenic
mouse model of ALS where degeneration of motor neurons and loss of
neuromuscular junctions are characteristic of the disease and can be
readily monitored. We first tested whether short-term DLK inhibition
was sufficient to reverse existing DLK/JNK signaling in vivo. GNE-3511
treatment reduced the number of p-c-Jun–positive cells in a dose-
dependent manner in the spinal cords of 14-week-old SOD1G93A
mice when compared with vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 7, A to C).
Similar results were obtained with GNE-8505 treatment (Fig. 7B),
confirming that this effect was a result of DLK inhibition. Furthermore,
a single dose of GNE-8505 was sufficient to elicit a comparable dose-
dependent reduction in brain p-c-Jun at 6 hours after dose in both
PS2APP and TauP301L mice, suggesting that this observation was not
specific to the SOD1G93A mouse model (fig. S10). Thus, acute treatment
of mid–disease stage animals with DLK inhibitors reduced activity in
the DLK/JNK signaling pathway and decreased p-c-Jun even when
disease-related JNK signaling had been present for weeks before drug
treatment.
To determine whether DLK inhibitor treatment was able to protect
motor neurons from degeneration, we first treated cultured mouse em-
bryonic stem cell–derived HB9-GFP (HB9–green fluorescent protein)–
positive motor neurons with GNE-3511 after trophic factor withdrawal.
A dose-dependent increase in motor neuron survival was observed at
24 hours after addition of the compound (Fig. 7, D and E). We then
examinedwhetherchronicGNE-3511treatmentwasabletoslowdisease
progression in SOD1G93A mice. In an effort to design a feasible pre-
clinicalstudy in whichthe SOD1G93Amice were receiving adequate dos-
ing while minimizing dosing-related stress, we opted to administer
GNE-3511 in food and assessedan early measure of disease progression,
neuromuscular junction loss. Loss of innervation of the neuromuscular
junctions in gastrocnemius muscle is one of the first signs of disease in
thismodel(45,46),withmorethan50%ofneuromuscularjunctionsshow-
ing complete denervation by 9 weeks of age. Notably, GNE-3511 treat-
ment delayed neuromuscular junction denervation by ~10% (Fig. 7, F to
H, and fig. S11; P = 0.0094) compared to vehicle-treated SOD1G93A
mice, demonstrating that chronic inhibition of DLK between 5 and
9 weeks of age was able to provide neuroprotection in this mouse model
of ALS.
DISCUSSION
Here, we demonstrate that either genetic deletion or pharmacological
inhibition of DLK is sufficient to reduce disease-associated JNK
pathway activation and provide functional neuroprotection in mouse
models of ALS and AD. The function of DLK signaling described here
is consistent with reports examining DLK function after acute insults,
suchas axonalinjury, excitotoxic insult, and MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-
1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) treatment (3–5, 15, 47), suggesting that
DLK represents a conserved component of the neuronal stress response
that is downstream of a variety of insults. This, along with the observa-
tion that similar JNK pathway activation exists in the CNS of patients
with ALS and AD, supports the hypothesis that DLK signaling
contributes to neuronaldegeneration and subsequent functional decline
in a range of neurodegenerative diseases.
The number of p-c-Jun–positive neurons present in the SOD1G93A
mouse model of ALS was considerably higher than the number ex-
pected to be undergoing apoptosis at any given time (18). In addition,
widespread p-c-Jun–positive cells are present in PS2APP mice, al-
though extensive neuronal loss does not occur in this AD mouse model
(40, 41). These observations suggest that DLK activation may not lead
directly to apoptosis. Instead, neurons appear to undergo an extended
period of stress, suggesting that DLK/JNK signaling may also contribute
to degeneration of neuronal processes and synapse loss. The rescue of
synaptic spines in PS2APP mice via Dlk deletion provides a direct dem-
onstration that loss of this prodegenerative signal protects against sub-
apoptotic cellular damage. Last, the cognitive improvements observed
in PS2APPmiceafterlateDlkdeletion arguesthatmeaningfulfunctional
benefitcan be achieved by halting existing neuronalDLK/JNK signaling.
These observations along with the rapid reversal of c-Jun phosphoryl-
ation and stress-induced transcriptional changes within hours of a single
DLK inhibitor treatment argue that individual neurons can still be res-
cued from degeneration after DLK/JNK pathway activation. Data from
multiple studies indicate that some adaptive/proregenerative stress re-
sponses may also take place in p-c-Jun–positive neurons (5, 9–12), yet
the functional benefits observed in DLKcKO animals argue that loss of
DLK signaling provides a net benefit in the context of chronic neuro-
degeneration.
Nonetheless,importantquestionsmuststillbe answeredtoaccurately
assess the therapeutic potential of this approach. First, although the
histological protection of neurons in DLKcKO mice was robust across
models, it is challenging to determine whether the effect size observed
in the functional end points measured would be likely to translate to
clinical benefit. Second, additional studies are needed to determine the
level of DLK inhibition required to maintain efficacy after chronic
drug treatment and to confirm that these doses will be tolerated. Al-
though encouraging progress has been made toward the development
of selective brain-penetrant DLK inhibitors (15, 16), it has historically
proved challenging to design kinase inhibitors that are well tolerated
in clinical studies.
There are a number of considerations, however, that make targeting
DLK more attractive than other approaches aimed at inhibition of JNK
signaling. First, DLK expression is enriched in neurons and specifically
regulates stress-induced JNK signaling (32, 48, 49), providing a specific
means to target neuronal dysfunction in CNS disease, in contrast to
many other components of the JNK signaling pathway (32). Second,
loss of DLK signaling in the adult is well tolerated (4). Third, given
the broad regulation of the transcriptional stress response in neurons
via DLK signaling and the ability of DLK inhibitors to rapidly reverse
injury-induced gene expression changes (Fig. 6), DLK inhibitor treat-
ment could potentially attenuate a range of downstream signaling
events in the context of progressive degeneration (5). Given the con-
sistent role for DLK/JNK signaling in multiple disease models driven
by diverse mechanisms, DLK inhibitors hold broad therapeutic
potential and may warrant advancement to clinical studies should safe
compounds be identified.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The primary research objectives of this study were to assess whether
mouse models of neurodegeneration (including SOD1G93A, PS2APP,
and TauP301L mice) and CNS tissue from patients with ALS and AD
display evidence of increased DLK pathway activity and to test whether
genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of DLK could ameliorate
end points of disease progression. In all experiments, animals were
randomly assigned to experimental or treatment groups and matched
for age, sex, and littermate controls. All behavioral scorings and histolog-
ical analyses were carried out blind to genotype and treatment groups.
Any SOD1G93A transgenic mouse with a reduced transgene copy number
was excluded (fig. S4). All animal studies were authorized and approved
by the Genentech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Human
samples were procured with Ethics Committee approval and written
informed consent.
Mice
ALS mouse models used in this work were the SOD1G93A high–copy
number transgenic mice (SOD1) originally derived from the Jackson
Laboratory [JAX stock #002726 (21)] and backcrossed for at least
10 generations into C57BL/6N (Charles River Laboratories) and
TDP-43A315T (JAX #010700) (23). Treatment groups for all experi-
ments using SOD1 mice were balanced for gender and litter, and all
mice were genotyped for SOD1 copy number (fig. S4 and table S1).
AD mouse models used in this study included PS2APP mice that co-
express human APP (hAPP) with the Swedish mutation K670N/
M671L and human presenilin 2 with the N141I mutation, driven by
Thy1 and PrP promoters, respectively (25). TauP301L mice overexpress
mutant human Tau with the P301L mutation (26) driven by the Thy1
promoter. The PS2APP and Tau alleles in each line were bred to homo-
zygosity for all mice used in this study.
Inducible DLK knockout mice were described previously (4). Briefly,
DLKlox mice were crossed with CAG-CreERT mice (JAX #004453) to
generate DLKlox;Crepos or DLKlox;Creneg mice. These mice were then
crossed with the SOD1G93A, PS2APP, and TauP301L mice generating,
for example, SOD1G93A;DLKlox;Creneg and SOD1G93A;DLKlox;Crepos
mice, which are referred to as SOD1G93A;DLKWT and SOD1G93A;DLKcKO,
respectively, after recombination. Dlk excision was achieved by placing
the mice on a tamoxifen-containing diet (about 40 mg/kg per day) for
3 weeks to induce Cre-mediated DNA recombination. This protocol
was found to generate maximal recombination efficiency of the Dlk
allele in the CNS while minimizing the loss of animals due to tamox-
ifen toxicity. All mice in this study were placed on this diet, including
nonTg controls, where applicable. SOD1G93A mice were placed on the
diet at 28 daysof age and PS2APPand TauP301L mice at 10 to 12 weeks of
age or 6 months of age. While on medicated chow, all mice appeared
healthy and active overall despite modest weight loss (up to 10 to
15%). All mice were returned to regular chow diet after the tamoxifen
treatment.
Human postmortem samples for Western blotting
and immunohistochemistry
Frozen spinal cord tissues were procured from patients with sporadic
ALS and control subjects with no known neurodegenerative diseases.
These cases were clinically and neuropathologically evaluated at the
University of California, San Francisco. Additional human tissue speci-
mens were provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs Repository.
Human frozen brain samples were procuredfrompatientswithputative
AD (early-stage AD) or confirmed AD along with age-matched controls
from Folio Biosciences or Banner Sun Health Research Institute. All
human tissues were collected with informed consents and institutional
review board approvals.
Tissue harvest and preparation
SOD1 mice were anesthetized with 2.5% tribromoethanol (0.5 ml/25 g
body weight)and transcardially exsanguinatedwithphosphate-buffered
saline(PBS)followedby4%paraformaldehyde(PFA)inPBSforfixation.
Gastrocnemiusmuscleswerecollectedandcryoprotectedin30%sucrose.
Sciatic nerve was harvested 2 to 3 cm proximal to the branch point of
the tibial, peroneal, and sural nerves and postfixed in 4% PFA overnight.
Spinal cords were harvested as previously described and postfixed in
4%PFAovernight,thentransferredtoPBS,andshippedtoNeuroScience
Associates for histology.
At indicated time points, PS2APP and TauP301L on DLKWT or
DLKcKObackgroundanimalsweredeeplyanesthetizedandPBS-perfused.
After PBS perfusion, the brain was collected, and the left hippocampus
and cortex were frozen and later homogenized for Western blotting (see
Supplementary Materials and Methods). The right forebrain was drop-
fixed in 4% PFA for 48-hour shaking at 4°C, then cryoprotected in
30%sucrose,andsectionedsagittallyat35mmusingaslidingmicrotome.
Sections were preserved in cryoprotectant (30% glycerol, 30% ethylene
glycol, and PBS) and stored at −20°C.
Immunohistochemical staining
Spinal cord histology and staining
Lumbar spinal cord segments were sectioned and sampled as previously
described (45). They were multiply embedded into a gelatin matrix using
MultiBrain Technology (NeuroScience Associates). Each MultiBrain
block was sectioned coronally at 25 mm. A series of 33 sections equally
spaced at 300-mm intervals throughout the entire lumbar spinalcord was
used for staining. Spinal cord sections were stained as previously de-
scribed (45). Immunohistochemical staining was performed using
goat anti-ChAT (Millipore AB144P), rabbit anti-GFAP (Dako
Z0334), rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako 019-19741), rabbit anti–p-c-Jun (Ser63)
II (Cell Signaling #9261), and mouse anti-NeuN (clone A60, Millipore
MAB377).
Brain histology and staining
Free-floating sections (35 mm thick) were rinsed in PBS then PBS with
0.1% Triton X (PBST), treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBST,
and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST before
overnight incubation at 4°C, with primary antibody diluted in 1%
BSA in PBST [anti-Iba1 (1:1000), anti-GFAP (1:1000), and anti–
p-c-Jun (Ser63)II (1:600)].Binding wasdetectedwithbiotin-conjugated
secondary antibodies, followed by avidin–biotin–horseradish per-
oxidase (HRP) complex (details in VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit;
Vector Laboratories #PK6100), and developed with diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride.
For detection of p-c-Jun (Ser63) in human AD and control tissue,
immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-mm-thick formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections mounted on glass slides. Staining was
performed on Dako Autostainer using Target Retrieval Solution (Dako)
for antigen retrieval. Detection used goat anti-rabbit biotinylated sec-
ondary antibody (Vector Laboratories), followed by VECTASTAIN
Elite ABC HRP kit (Vector Laboratories) and metal-enhanced dia-
minobenzidine visualization (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and
coverslipped.

 Statistical analysis
Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software
(GraphPad Software Inc.) or JMP 10.0.2 software (SAS Institute Inc.).
All data are presented as means ± SEM, except when stated otherwise in
the figure legends. Unless otherwise stated, for quantitative cell mor-
phology (spine density), biochemical, and histological analysis, statistical
significance was assessed by Student’s t test for comparison between two
samplesorbyone-wayortwo-wayANOVAwithposthocTukey-Kramer
honest significant difference test for comparison across multiple groups
or Dunnett’s test versus controls. Nonparametric tests included Mann-
Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by Dunn’s multiple-
comparison test. For behavioral data collected over multiple sessions or
positions(thatis,activeavoidance),weusedmultifactorrepeated-measures
ANOVA with the between-subjects factor of genotype (PS2APP or
DLK) and the within-subjects factor of sessions (sessions or trials).
For survival analysis of the SOD1 mice, a log-rank test was assessed
for the whole model, with examination of DLK genotype and sex effects.
