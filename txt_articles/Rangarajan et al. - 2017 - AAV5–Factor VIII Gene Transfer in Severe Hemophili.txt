BACKGROUND
Patients with hemophilia A rely on exogenous factor VIII to prevent bleeding in 
joints, soft tissue, and the central nervous system. Although successful gene trans-
fer has been reported in patients with hemophilia B, the large size of the factor 
VIII coding region has precluded improved outcomes with gene therapy in patients 
with hemophilia A.
METHODS
We infused a single intravenous dose of a codon-optimized adeno-associated virus 
serotype 5 (AAV5) vector encoding a B-domain–deleted human factor VIII (AAV5-
hFVIII-SQ) in nine men with severe hemophilia A. Participants were enrolled se-
quentially into one of three dose cohorts (low dose [one participant], intermediate 
dose [one participant], and high dose [seven participants]) and were followed through 
52 weeks.
RESULTS
Factor VIII activity levels remained at 3 IU or less per deciliter in the recipients of 
the low or intermediate dose. In the high-dose cohort, the factor VIII activity 
level was more than 5 IU per deciliter between weeks 2 and 9 after gene transfer 
in all seven participants, and the level in six participants increased to a normal 
value (>50 IU per deciliter) that was maintained at 1 year after receipt of the dose. 
In the high-dose cohort, the median annualized bleeding rate among participants 
who had previously received prophylactic therapy decreased from 16 events before 
the study to 1 event after gene transfer, and factor VIII use for participant-reported 
bleeding ceased in all the participants in this cohort by week 22. The primary ad-
verse event was an elevation in the serum alanine aminotransferase level to 1.5 times 
the upper limit of the normal range or less. Progression of preexisting chronic 
arthropathy in one participant was the only serious adverse event. No neutralizing 
antibodies to factor VIII were detected.
CONCLUSIONS
The infusion of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ was associated with the sustained normalization 
of factor VIII activity level over a period of 1 year in six of seven participants who 
received a high dose, with stabilization of hemostasis and a profound reduction in 
factor VIII use in all seven participants. In this small study, no safety events were 
noted, but no safety conclusions can be drawn. (Funded by BioMarin Pharmaceuti-

H
emophilia A, an X-linked bleeding 
disorder, results from mutations in the 
gene encoding coagulation factor VIII. 
Patients with severe hemophilia A (factor VIII 
activity level, <1 IU per deciliter) are susceptible 
to spontaneous or provoked bleeding in joints 
and soft tissue, resulting in painful disabling 
arthropathy, impairment in well-being, and ele-
vated risks of intracranial hemorrhage and early 
death.1,2
Although many patients with hemophilia A 
receive exogenous factor VIII only when bleeding 
occurs (on-demand therapy), the current standard 
of care in developed countries is the prophylactic 
administration of intravenous factor VIII.3 How-
ever, the relatively short half-life of available factor 
VIII and extended half-life factor VIII concentrates 
(8 to 19 hours) necessitates frequent infusions (up 
to 3 times weekly), making adherence to therapy 
and adequate hemostasis challenging and ad-
versely affecting patients’ quality of life.4,5 Despite 
the widespread adoption of factor VIII prophy-
laxis in North America and Europe, breakthrough 
bleeding causing progressive joint destruction and 
impairment in quality of life still occurs,3,6-8 par-
ticularly when trough levels of factor VIII drop 
below 1 IU per deciliter.9
Vector-mediated gene therapy has been suc-
cessful in the long-term correction of underlying 
deficiencies in several genetic diseases.10-12 A sin-
gle infusion of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) 
vector expressing a human factor IX transgene 
led to therapeutic but low FIX plasma levels and 
clinical improvement for up to 3 years in 10 men 
with severe hemophilia B.13,14 However, the use 
of AAV vectors in gene therapy for hemophilia A 
poses specific challenges that are due to the large 
size and inefficient expression of the human fac-
tor VIII coding sequence.15-17 To overcome these 
obstacles, we developed AAV5-hFVIII-SQ (valoc-
tocogene roxaparvovec), an AAV serotype 5 vector 
containing a codon-optimized expression cassette 
for the SQ variant of B-domain–deleted human 
factor VIII. A dose-dependent increase in factor 
VIII expression in mouse and nonhuman primate 
models after the injection of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ with 
a liver-specific promoter (on the basis of a con-
struct by McIntosh et al.17) provided the rationale 
for our study. We report data from a phase 1–2 
dose-escalation study of factor VIII gene transfer 
that used a single intravenous infusion of AAV5-
hFVIII-SQ in nine men with severe hemophilia A.
Methods
Study Design and Assessments
Eligible participants were adults with severe he-
mophilia A, with no history of factor VIII in-
hibitor development and without detectable im-
munity to the AAV5 capsid in a cell-based in vitro 
transduction-inhibition assay and a total anti-
AAV5 antibody assay.18 At least 150 days of previ-
ous exposure to factor VIII concentrate or cryo-
precipitate was required. For participants using 
on-demand factor VIII therapy, the criterion for 
inclusion was at least 12 bleeding episodes (de-
fined as a bleeding event [or multiple bleeding 
events on same day] resulting in factor VIII re-
placement treatment) in the 12 months before 
study entry. Complete eligibility criteria are shown 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
From September 2015 through April 2016, 
nine participants were enrolled sequentially into 
three dose cohorts at five sites in the United 
Kingdom and received a single dose of AAV5-
hFVIII-SQ infused (over a period of approximately 
1 hour) into a peripheral vein. The low-dose cohort 
(one participant) received a dose of 6×1012 vector 
genomes (vg) per kilogram of body weight; the 
intermediate-dose cohort (one participant), 2×1013 
vg per kilogram; and the high-dose cohort (seven 
participants), 6×1013 vg per kilogram. Escalation 
to the next dose cohort occurred after a single 
patient had received a dose safely and if the fac-
tor VIII activity level was less than 5 IU per deci-
liter at week 3 after gene transfer. All the partici-
pants were hospitalized for the study-drug infusion 
and were observed for 24 hours.
All the participants who had been receiving 
prophylactic factor VIII therapy previously were 
withdrawn from prophylaxis. However, patients 
were permitted to self-administer factor VIII ther-
apy in the event of bleeding after gene transfer. On 
the basis of previous studies of AAV gene trans-
fer,13,14,19 the study protocol (available at NEJM.org) 
required the initiation of a therapeutic course of 
glucocorticoids (prednisolone at a dose of 60 mg 
per day, tapering over a period of ≥11 weeks) if 
the alanine aminotransferase level increased to 
1.5 or more times the individual participant’s 
baseline level. After the occurrence of this event 
in the first participant in the high-dose cohort who 
received the infusion (Participant 3), subsequent 
participants received prophylactic prednisolone (at

AAV Gene Transfer in Severe Hemophilia A
a dose of 40 mg per day, tapering from week 3 
to week 17 or longer).
Safety was the primary end point of the study. 
The prospectively specified primary efficacy goal 
was a factor VIII activity level of at least 5 IU per 
deciliter at week 16 after gene transfer. Second-
ary efficacy measures were the frequency of fac-
tor VIII use and the number of bleeding episodes. 
Additional measurements included the develop-
ment of factor VIII inhibitors (neutralizing anti-
bodies), anti–AAV5 capsid total antibody levels, 
vector shedding, and cellular immune responses to 
the factor VIII transgene product and AAV capsid 
proteins. We are continuing to monitor long-term 
safety. Factor VIII activity assays were performed at 
a central laboratory (Esoterix) with the use of both 
a one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time–
based clotting assay and a chromogenic factor Xa 
assay (see the Factor VIII Activity Level Assays 
section in the Supplementary Appendix).
Vector Production and Formulation
AAV5-hFVIII-SQ is a recombinant codon-optimized 
AAV5 vector that expresses the SQ variant of 
B-domain–deleted human factor VIII with a hybrid 
liver-specific transcription promoter (Fig. S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).17,20 The expression 
cassette is inserted between two AAV serotype 2 
inverted terminal repeats. AAV5-hFVIII-SQ was 
manufactured with the use of a baculovirus–
Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect-cell production 
system.21
Study Oversight
The study was designed by the sponsor, BioMarin 
Pharmaceutical, and three authors who were not 
employees of the sponsor. The study was conduct-
ed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines and the principles of the Declaration 
of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by 
relevant ethics boards. Written informed consent 
was provided by each participant. BioMarin Phar-
maceutical oversaw the collection and analysis of 
data. The manuscript was written with medical 
writing assistance funded by BioMarin Pharmaceu-
tical, with critical review and input from all the 
authors. One of the authors who is an employee of 
the sponsor and another employee of the sponsor 
performed the statistical analyses. All the authors 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the 
data and analyses and for the adherence of the study 
to the protocol.
Statistical Analysis
Analysis of the data was descriptive in nature, 
including means with standard deviations and 
medians, ranges, and interquartile ranges for 
continuous variables and counts and percentag-
es for categorical variables. All the participants 
who received the study drug were included in the 
safety and efficacy analyses. The factor VIII ac-
tivity level was assessed approximately every week 
at a central laboratory through week 36 and every 
other week through week 52 after gene transfer. 
Factor VIII activity levels below the lower limit 
of quantitation were imputed with half the lower 
limit of quantitation, and factor VIII activity 
levels obtained within 72 hours after the last use 
of exogenous factor VIII were excluded from the 
analyses. A box plot of median factor VIII activ-
ity levels within 4-week windows was generated. 
A regression analysis of the factor VIII activity 
levels in the one-stage assay and in the chromo-
genic assay was conducted involving participants 
in the high-dose cohort.
Validated medical records, diaries, and inter-
views with participants were used to calculate ex-
ogenous factor VIII use, factor VIII consumption, 
and frequency of bleeding episodes. The annual-
ized bleeding rate for each participant was calcu-
lated as follows: (total number of bleeding epi-
sodes 
÷ 
total number of days during the calculation 
period) 
× 
365.25. Similarly, the annualized rate of 
factor VIII use was calculated as follows: (total 
number of infusions of exogenous factor VIII 
÷ 
to-
tal number of days during the calculation peri-
od) 
× 
365.25. The annualized factor VIII consump-
tion was calculated as follows: (total factor VIII 
consumption 
÷ 
total number of days during the 
calculation period) 
× 
365.25. Adverse events were 
reported with the use of the Common Terminol-
ogy Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. A box 
plot of maximum alanine aminotransferase values 
within 4-week windows was created. The statisti-
cal analysis plan is available with the protocol.
Results
Characteristics of the Participants
Nine men with severe hemophilia A were enrolled 
into one of the three dose cohorts and were fol-
lowed through the week 52 visit (Table 1). Eight 
participants had been receiving regular factor VIII 
prophylaxis before the study. Participant 4 used 
on-demand factor VIII for bleeding episodes.

Safety of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ Infusion
The adverse events that were reported in at least 
three of the nine participants were an increased 
alanine aminotransferase level (in seven), arthral-
gia (in six), back pain (in four), an increased as-
partate aminotransferase level (in three), fatigue 
(in three), and productive cough (in three); all 
these events were of mild severity except for one 
moderate event of arthralgia and one moderately 
increased level of aspartate aminotransferase. The 
only serious adverse event was progression of 
chronic arthropathy in Participant 6, which oc-
curred at an anatomical site that had often been 
a bleeding site before treatment and for which he 
subsequently had surgical knee replacement.
Eight participants (one in the low-dose cohort 
and seven in the high-dose cohort) had increased 
laboratory values regarding alanine aminotrans-
ferase, with the first observed value above the 
upper limit of the normal range at week 3; peak 
values ranged from 59 to 128 U per liter (normal 
range, 6 to 43) (Fig. 1, and Fig. S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). All these events were asymp-
tomatic and resolved without sequelae. In two 
participants (Participants 1 and 5), the rise in 
the alanine aminotransferase level was concurrent 
with alcohol consumption, hepatotoxic medication 
(celecoxib), or vigorous exercise (or a combina-
tion of these events). No participant had abnor-
mal elevations in the bilirubin or alkaline phos-
phatase level.
All the participants in the high-dose cohort 
received glucocorticoids (Fig. 1 and Table 1), and 
all had the glucocorticoids successfully tapered 
off. Participants 1 and 2 (in the two lower-dose 
cohorts) did not receive glucocorticoids during 
the study. There was no clear association between 
the resolution of the elevated alanine aminotrans-
ferase level and prednisolone use. The increased 
alanine aminotransferase level was accompanied 
by a decline in the factor VIII activity level in 
only one participant (Participant 4), in whom the 
level declined from 227 IU per deciliter to 52 IU 
per deciliter in conjunction with an increase in 
the alanine aminotransferase level from week 28 
to week 35 (peak value, 95 U per liter) (Fig. 1). A 
decline in the alanine aminotransferase level was 
noted before the initiation of therapeutic pred-
nisolone. The factor VIII activity level subsequent-
ly increased, and no bleeding was reported.
Efficacy Results
Low-Dose Cohort
In the low-dose cohort (AAV5-hFVIII-SQ at a dose 
of 6×1012 vg per kilogram), the factor VIII activity 
level remained under 1 IU per deciliter through 
week 54 in Participant 1 (Fig. 1). The consump-
tion of factor VIII was 95 infusions per year 
(3792 IU per kilogram per year) before the study 
and 123 infusions per year (3461 IU per kilogram 
per year) after gene transfer. The participant re-
sumed factor VIII prophylaxis after week 16.
Intermediate-Dose Cohort
In the intermediate-dose cohort (AAV5-hFVIII-
SQ at a dose of 2×1013 vg per kilogram), Partici-
pant 2 had a stable but low factor VIII activity 
level (1 to 3 IU per deciliter) through week 54 
(Fig. 1). He discontinued factor VIII prophylaxis. 
The consumption of factor VIII fell from 104 in-
fusions per year before the study to 14 infusions 
per year after gene transfer (reduction in con-
sumption, from 3029 to 366 IU per kilogram per 
year), but the annualized bleeding rate increased 
from 3 to 11 events. The participant elected to 
continue with on-demand therapy.
High-Dose Cohort
After the infusion in the high-dose cohort 
(AAV5-hFVIII-SQ at a dose of 6×1013 vg per kilo-
gram), the factor VIII activity level gradually in-
creased and then appeared to plateau at or above 
physiologic levels in weeks 20 through 24 (Figs. 
1 and 2). At week 16 (the prespecified time point 
for the efficacy assessment), all seven participants 
had a factor VIII activity level that was more than 
5 IU per deciliter (5 IU per deciliter is the cutoff 
for moderate vs. mild hemophilia); this level oc-
curred in four participants by week 2 (Table 1). 
After week 20, the factor VIII activity level was 
consistently more than 50 IU per deciliter in six 
of seven participants, and in the remaining par-
ticipant the level typically ranged from 12 to 32 
IU per deciliter. At week 52, the median factor 
VIII activity level was 77 IU per deciliter (range, 
19 to 164; mean [±SD] level, 93±48). The factor 
VIII activity levels reported here are from the one-
stage clotting assay and were consistently ap-
proximately 1.65 times as high as the factor VIII 
levels from the chromogenic assay (see the Com-
parison of One-Stage and Chromogenic Assays

AAV Gene Transfer in Severe Hemophilia A
for Factor VIII Activity section and Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
In the six participants who had received fac-
tor VIII prophylaxis before the study, the median 
annualized bleeding rate dropped from 16 events 
per year before the study to 1 event per year after 
gene transfer (mean reduction in rate, from 16 
to 2 events) (Fig. 3A). The median annualized 
use of factor VIII fell from 138 infusions per 
year before the study to 2 infusions per year af-
ter gene transfer (mean reduction in rate, from 
137 to 5 infusions per year) and was 0 after week 
2 (i.e., when the endogenous factor VIII activity 
level reached 1 to 5 IU per deciliter) (Fig. 3B). The 
median consumption of factor VIII decreased 
from 5286 to 65 IU per kilogram per year. One 
participant did not use factor VIII at all after 
gene transfer, and four ceased factor VIII use 
after week 2. Only Participant 6 used factor VIII 
for self-reported bleeding after week 2 — at 
week 21 for a knee that had undergone multiple 
radiosynovectomy procedures previously; at this 
time, his circulating factor VIII level was 12 IU 
per deciliter. He subsequently underwent total 
knee replacement, with perioperative use of fac-
tor VIII, at week 54.
In the one participant (Participant 4) who had 
previously used on-demand factor VIII therapy, 
factor VIII consumption fell from 833 IU per 
kilogram per year before the study to 81 IU per 
kilogram per year after gene transfer. After week 
2, the participant used factor VIII only once for 
self-diagnosed bleeding at week 7; the factor VIII 
activity level at the time was 34 to 66 IU per 
deciliter.
Host Immune Response to Factor VIII and AAV5
AAV5 capsid-specific antibodies developed after 
gene transfer in all the participants by week 8 
(the first time point assessed). However, cellular 
immune responses that were specific for AAV5 
capsid peptides were not detected at any time 
point, according to interferon-γ enzyme-linked 
immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. In Participants 6 
and 9, at one time point each, the results on the 
interferon-γ ELISPOT assay above the established 
threshold for positivity (50 spot-forming units 
[SFU] per 106 peripheral-blood mononuclear cells) 
were detected against FVIII-SQ peptides. These 
responses, with a maximal value of 120 SFU per 
106 peripheral-blood mononuclear cells, were 
not consistently associated with increasing levels 
of alanine aminotransferase or declines in mea-
sures of factor VIII and returned to negative 4 
weeks later. No participant tested positive for 
factor VIII inhibitors at any time point according 
to the Nijmegen–Bethesda assay.
Vector Shedding
Vector DNA was detected by the quantitative 
polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay in blood, 
semen, saliva, urine, and feces within 72 hours 
after infusion in all the participants, with peak 
levels in weeks 1 through 4. Samples were re-
ported as negative only if no signal on the quan-
titative PCR assay above the threshold of ampli-
fication was observed; otherwise, the results were 
reported as positive. Positive samples at or above 
the limit of quantitation were reported with nu-
merical results, and positive samples below the 
limit of quantitation were reported as being be-
low the limit of quantitation. Clearance for each 
matrix was defined as having had negative re-
sults at three consecutive visits.
Overall, all the samples of biologic fluids and 
feces showed decreasing quantities of residual 
vector DNA over the study period. For the two 
participants in the two lower-dose cohorts, the 
fastest clearing biologic fluids were urine (5 weeks 
and 11 weeks) and semen (11 weeks and 13 weeks). 
Each of these participants had two consecutive 
negative results in saliva at week 52. The sam-
ples from Participant 1 (in the low-dose cohort) 
indicated that feces was cleared and the blood 
Figure 1 (facing page). Individual Participant Profiles, 
Including Factor VIII Activity Levels, Bleeding Epi-
sodes, Levels of Alanine Aminotransferase, and Gluco-
corticoid Use.
Participant 1 was in the low­dose cohort (dose, 6×1012 
vector genomes [vg] per kilogram of body weight), 
Participant 2 in the intermediate­dose cohort (dose, 
2×1013 vg per kilogram), and Participants 3 through 9 
in the high­dose cohort (dose, 6×1013 vg per kilo­
gram). The dose (dashed vertical line) was adminis­
tered on day 0. Factor VIII values are from the one­
stage assay performed by a central laboratory 
(Esoterix); the normal range is 50 to 150 IU per decili­
ter. The normal range for the alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) level is 6 to 43 U per liter; the upper limit of the 
normal range is indicated by the horizontal dashed 
line. Arrows indicate bleeding episodes that were re­
ported by the participant. The dose of glucocorticoids 
(values associated with green bars) in Participants 3 
through 9 is shown in milligrams per day; Participants 
1 and 2 did not use glucocorticoids.

level was below the limit of quantitation at week 
52. The samples from Participant 2 (in the inter-
mediate-dose cohort) indicated one negative re-
sult in the feces compartment and a blood level 
above the limit of quantitation at week 52.
In the high-dose cohort, residual levels of 
vector DNA were present in all seven partici-
pants at week 52 in blood, with all values above 
the limit of quantitation. The fastest clearing bio-
logic fluid was urine, with all participants having 
urine cleared at or before 28 weeks (range, 6 to 
28) (Fig. 4). Four of the seven participants had 
semen cleared at or before 36 weeks (range, 16 
to 36); of the remaining three participants, one 
had two consecutive negative results (this par-
ticipant had semen cleared at week 56 when three 
consecutive negative results were obtained), and 
two had levels below the limit of quantitation in 
semen at week 52. On further investigation, we 
found that vector DNA was not present in puri-
fied sperm cells that were obtained from these 
two participants, which ruled out the risk of 
inadvertent germline modification. All the par-
ticipants in the high-dose cohort had samples 
showing that saliva was cleared at or before 52 
weeks (range, 40 to 52). No participant in the 
high-dose cohort had a sample showing that fe-
ces was cleared at week 52, but all the levels were 
below the limit of quantitation. The household 
contacts of the participants were not examined.
Discussion
We report the results of a phase 1–2, dose-esca-
lation study to assess the safety and efficacy of a 
single peripheral infusion of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ, a 
codon-optimized AAV5 vector encoding B-domain–
deleted human factor VIII, in nine men with se-
vere hemophilia A. These changes in the vector 
and the gene resulted in successful gene transfer 
in participants with hemophilia A, despite the 
large size of the coding region.
Increases in the factor VIII activity levels were 
dose-dependent, with all seven participants in 
Figure 2. Factor VIII Activity Levels in the High-Dose Cohort.
Factor VIII values are from the one­stage assay performed by a central laboratory (Esoterix), with normal values of 
50 to 150 IU per deciliter (shaded area). Data were available for all seven participants in the high­dose cohort, ex­
cept that data were not available for Participant 7 at week 32. The plot is based on the median values of factor VIII 
activity within 4­week windows for each participant. The horizontal line within each box indicates the median value 
among the participants. The lower and upper boundaries of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, re­
spectively. The ends of the whisker lines represent the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the inter­
quartile range from the lower and upper box boundaries. Mean values are indicated by diamonds. Factor VIII activity 
levels below the limit of quantitation were imputed as being 0.5 IU per deciliter. Factor VIII activity levels within a 
72­hour period since the last consumption of factor VIII were excluded. Data points beyond the range (i.e., 1.5 times 
the interquartile range from the lower and upper box boundaries) were considered to be outliers and are marked 
with an ×.

AAV Gene Transfer in Severe Hemophilia A
the high-dose cohort (dose, 6×1013 vg per kilo-
gram) sustaining therapeutic levels at 1 year af-
ter gene transfer. In conjunction, the frequency of 
participant-treated bleeding episodes decreased 
markedly, with resultant cessation of factor VIII 
use. The absence of spontaneous bleeding in pa-
tients with severe hemophilia A is uncommon 
with factor VIII replacement therapy, regardless 
of the product half-life. Cessation of prophylac-
tic infusions, reduced use of pain medications 
and other medications, freedom from microbleed-
ing, and absence of unprotected periods of factor 
VIII trough levels of less than 1 IU per deciliter 
from replacement therapy are likely to provide 
improved quality of life to patients.
Three previous clinical trials of gene transfer 
in patients with severe hemophilia A have been 
unsuccessful. In two trials, one with the use of 
ex vivo transfected dermal fibroblasts expressing 
a modified factor VIII molecule22 and one with 
the use of a retroviral vector expressing factor 
VIII,23 the sustained expression of adequate fac-
tor VIII levels did not occur. A third trial, in which 
adenovirus was used to deliver the factor VIII gene, 
was terminated owing to toxic events in a single 
patient.24
In contrast, in the current study, six of seven 
participants in the high-dose cohort had a factor 
VIII activity level in or above the physiologic range 
(50 to 150 IU per deciliter) at 1 year after gene 
transfer (range, 76 to 164 IU per deciliter), and 
the factor VIII activity level in the remaining par-
ticipant was within the range for mild hemo-
philia (5 to 40 IU per deciliter). A factor VIII 
activity level of more than 5 IU per deciliter was 
reached in all seven participants between weeks 
2 and 9 after gene transfer, with stabilization 
between weeks 20 and 24. Observations of pro-
longed clinical benefit correspond with preclini-
cal findings showing the persistence of factor 
VIII expression for multiple years after AAV gene 
therapy in dogs.15 In view of studies that docu-
ment a close association between the factor VIII 
activity level and bleeding frequency (i.e., an 
18% reduction with every increase of 1 IU per 
deciliter in the factor VIII activity level),25 as well 
as between total and joint hemorrhages and dis-
abling arthropathy,8 the achievement of sustained 
factor VIII activity levels of more than 5 IU per 
deciliter after gene transfer in all the recipients 
in the high-dose cohort is encouraging.
The variation in the factor VIII activity levels 
among the participants is likely to be multifacto-
rial and may stem in part from differences in 
vector uptake within cells and in the synthesis, 
release, and metabolism of the factor VIII pro-
tein in the circulation. AAV5 delivery of the fac-
tor VIII transgene appears to take longer to reach

Participants in the High-Dose Cohort Who Were Receiving Factor VIII  
Prophylaxis before the Study.
Panel A shows the mean annualized bleeding rate (±SD) among the six 
participants in the high­dose cohort who were receiving exogenous factor 
VIII prophylaxis before study enrollment. The annualized bleeding rate was 
calculated as follows: (number of bleeding episodes ÷ total number of days 
during the calculation period) × 365.25. Median values with interquartile 
ranges (IQR) are also shown. Panel B shows the mean annualized use of 
factor VIII in these six participants. The annualized use of factor VIII was 
calculated as follows: (number of infusions of exogenous factor VIII replace­
ment therapy ÷ total number of days during the calculation period) × 365.25.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
a steady state than has been observed in previ-
ous studies that have used other serotypes and 
the FIX transgene; different expression kinetics 
between AAV serotypes26 and slow annealing of 
partial single-stranded DNA molecules because 
of the size of the factor VIII transgene may con-
tribute to this difference.
As in other trials of AAV-based gene thera-
py,13,19,27,28 a mild asymptomatic increase in the 
serum level of alanine aminotransferase was 
common. In contrast to results in a trial of an 
AAV serotype 8 vector in patients with hemo-
philia B,13,14 only one participant in our study 
had a decline in the factor VIII activity level with 
an increased level of alanine aminotransferase. 
The continued increase in factor VIII activity level 
concurrent with the increased level of alanine 
aminotransferase in the other six participants in 
the high-dose cohort, as well as the absence of a 
concomitant rise in the bilirubin or alkaline phos-
phatase level, is consistent with maintenance of a 
high level of hepatocyte function and suggests that 
hepatic toxicity may not be a limiting factor in 
treatment.
After infusion, antibodies to AAV5 were de-
tected in all the tested participants, but no T-cell–
mediated immune responses to AAV5 capsid pro-
teins were detected, and neutralizing antibodies to 
factor VIII did not develop in any participants. 
The absence of factor VIII inhibitors during more 
than 1 year of follow-up underscores the safety 
of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ. As has been observed in simi-
lar clinical trials of vector gene transfer,13,19,29 vec-
tor DNA was detected in various biologic fluids 
obtained from all the participants (see the Vector 
Shedding–Discussion section in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The possibility of vector integra-
tion was not assessed. The protocol was not de-
signed to measure whether AAV5 infection was 
present in family members or close contacts, and 
ethics approval was not sought to pursue this 
question. The two viral genes within AAV5 have 
been replaced by factor VIII, and AAV5 requires 
another virus such as an adenovirus for a pro-
ductive infection.
Factor VIII activity levels of more than 150 IU 
per deciliter were observed intermittently in four 
participants in the high-dose cohort, with peak 
Figure 4. Median Levels of Vector DNA in Biologic Fluids in the High-Dose Cohort.
The plot is based on the median level of vector DNA at each visit. When multiple test results were available for a participant in a visit 
window, the maximum result was picked for the participant for the median calculation of that visit. Negative values were carried over to 
the following visits without additional testing, after three consecutive negative test results were observed (i.e., after clearance was ob­
served). The data­cutoff date was based on the 52­week observation window. Values below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) were imputed 
as one half the validated LOQ of 50 vg per quantitative polymerase chain reaction and were then back­calculated to the theoretically cor­
responding vector genomes per standard unit of biologic specimen.

AAV Gene Transfer in Severe Hemophilia A
values ranging from 201 to 349 IU per deciliter. 
These values were not associated with clinical 
findings that were suggestive of a thrombotic 
event and did not lead to medical intervention. 
Periodic assessments of the platelet count, pro-
thrombin time, and activated partial-thrombo-
plastin time were within normal limits in these 
participants. Preliminary data regarding six par-
ticipants who received a dose (4×1013 vg per kilo-
gram) between the intermediate and high doses 
in our study support a dose response, with 
maximum factor VIII activity levels between 3 and 
50 IU per deciliter (during 5 to 20 weeks of ob-
servation).
Although mild asymptomatic elevations in 
the serum level of alanine aminotransferase were 
common, these were usually not associated with 
decreased factor VIII activity levels and were 
without clinical sequelae. We observed sustained 
factor VIII activity at therapeutic levels for 1 year 
in seven men with severe hemophilia A after a 
single intravenous infusion of a codon-optimized 
AAV5 vector expressing the SQ variant of the 
B-domain–deleted human factor VIII (at a dose 
of 6×1013 vg per kilogram). Increased levels of 
factor VIII activity were accompanied by a marked 
diminution in the rate of bleeding episodes and 
the cessation of exogenous factor VIII use.
