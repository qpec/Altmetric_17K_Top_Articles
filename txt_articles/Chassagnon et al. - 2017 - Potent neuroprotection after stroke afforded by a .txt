Stroke is the second-leading cause of death worldwide, yet there are
no drugs available to protect the brain from stroke-induced neuronal
injury. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is the primary acid sensor
in mammalian brain and a key mediator of acidosis-induced neuronal
damage following cerebral ischemia. Genetic ablation and selective
pharmacologic inhibition of ASIC1a reduces neuronal death follow-
ing ischemic stroke in rodents. Here, we demonstrate that Hi1a, a
disulfide-rich spider venom peptide, is highly neuroprotective in a
focal model of ischemic stroke. Nuclear magnetic resonance struc-
tural studies reveal that Hi1a comprises two homologous inhibitor
cystine knot domains separated by a short, structurally well-defined
linker. In contrast with known ASIC1a inhibitors, Hi1a incompletely
inhibits ASIC1a activation in a pH-independent and slowly reversible
manner. Whole-cell, macropatch, and single-channel electrophysio-
logical recordings indicate that Hi1a binds to and stabilizes the closed
state of the channel, thereby impeding the transition into a conduct-
ing state. Intracerebroventricular administration to rats of a single
small dose of Hi1a (2 ng/kg) up to 8 h after stroke induction by
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery markedly reduced infarct size,
and this correlated with improved neurological and motor function,
as well as with preservation of neuronal architecture. Thus, Hi1a is a
powerful pharmacological tool for probing the role of ASIC1a in acid-
mediated neuronal injury and various neurological disorders, and a
promising lead for the development of therapeutics to protect the
brain from ischemic injury.

ischemia
M
ost strokes (>85%) are ischemic (1–3), and the disruption of
blood flow that occurs during cerebral ischemia leads to
neuronal damage in localized vascular territories within a few
minutes (4). Whether blood flow is completely or partially im-
peded defines two distinct regions of tissue damage, known as the
core and penumbral (peri-infarct) zones, respectively (1–3, 5). The
core tissue exposed to the most dramatic reduction in blood flow is
mortally injured and thought to undergo irreversible necrotic cell
death (2). In contrast, the ischemic penumbra, which can compose
up to one-half of the total lesion volume during the initial stages of
ischemia, undergoes apoptosis over a period of hours to days, and
thus is potentially salvageable via poststroke therapy (2). With
time, the infarct core expands into the ischemic penumbra, and
this therapeutic opportunity is lost (1, 6).
Oxygen depletion during cerebral ischemia compels the brain to
switch from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis. The
resultant acidosis causes the extracellular pH to fall from ∼7.3 to 6.0–
6.5 in the ischemic core under normoglycemic conditions, and it can
fall to below 6.0 during severe ischemia under hyperglycemic condi-
tions (7, 8). The pH for half-maximal activation (pH50) of acid-sensing
ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) in human cortical neurons is 6.6 (9), and,
consequently, these channels are robustly activated by the decrease in
extracellular pH that occurs during cerebral ischemia. ASIC1a is the
primary acid sensor in mammalian brain (9, 10) and a key mediator of
stroke-induced neuronal damage. Genetic ablation of ASIC1a reduces
infarct size by ∼60% after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) in mice (7), whereas pharmacologic blockade with modestly
potent ASIC1a inhibitors, such as amiloride (7) and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (11), yield less robust neuroprotection.
The most potent inhibitor of ASIC1a identified to date is psalmotoxin
1 (PcTx1), a 40-residue peptide isolated from venom of the tarantula
Psalmopoeus cambridgei. PcTx1 inhibits rat ASIC1a (rASIC1a) with IC50
∼1 nM without inhibiting other ASIC subtypes (12, 13). Intra-
cerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of a single small dose of PcTx1
(1 ng/kg) at 2 h after MCAO in rats reduced cortical infarct volume by
∼70% and greatly improved behavioral outcomes (14). Intranasal ad-
ministration of P. cambridgei venom at 2–4 h after MCAO in mice re-
duced infarct volume by ∼50% (15), although how much of this affect
can be attributed to the inhibition of ASIC1a is unclear, given that PcTx1
represents only ∼0.4% of total venom protein (14). Neither PcTx1 nor
any other ASIC inhibitor has been shown to provide significant neuro-
protection beyond 2–4 h after stroke onset. Here, we describe the iso-
lation and characterization of a venom peptide that potently inhibits
Significance
Six million people die each year from stroke, and 5 million sur-
vivors are left with a permanent disability. Moreover, the neu-
ronal damage caused by stroke often triggers a progressive
decline in cognitive function that doubles the risk of dementia for
stroke survivors. Despite this massive global disease burden,
there are no approved drugs for treating the neuronal injury
caused to the brain by the oxygen deprivation occurring during
an ischemic stroke. The precipitous drop in brain pH resulting
from stroke activates acid-sensing ion channel 1a. We show that
inhibition of these channels using a “double-knot” spider venom
peptide massively attenuates brain damage after stroke and
improves behavioral outcomes, even when the peptide is ad-
ministered 8 h after stroke onset.

 ASIC1a via a unique mode of action and protects the brain from neu-
ronal injury when administered up to 8 h after stroke onset.
Results
Discovery of Hi1a. Analysis of a venom-gland transcriptome from the
Australian funnel-web spider Hadronyche infensa (Fig. 1A) revealed a
family of four peptides with marked similarity to PcTx1, the prototypical
ASIC1a inhibitor from an unrelated spider (12). In contrast to PcTx1,
these peptides are larger (75–77 residues), and comprise two tandem
PcTx1-like sequences joined by a short linker (Fig. 1B). The N- and
C-terminal regions of the most abundantly expressed family member,
Hi1a, have 62% and 50% identity with PcTx1, respectively, suggesting
that these peptides evolved through duplication of a gene encoding a
PcTx1-like toxin. Production of recombinant Hi1a by overexpression in
Escherichia coli yielded a single dominant isomer with six disulfide
bonds (Fig. S1). Two-electrode voltage-clamp (TEVC) recordings
revealed that Hi1a potently inhibits both rASIC1a and human ASIC1a
(hASIC1a) expressed in Xenopus oocytes (IC50 values of 0.40 and
0.52 nM, respectively) but never inhibits >80% of ASIC1a currents even
at saturating doses (Fig. 1 C and D). At 1 μM, Hi1a had no effect on
rASIC2a or rASIC3 and only mildly potentiated rASIC1b, indicative
of >2,000-fold higher potency for rASIC1a over these other subtypes
(Fig. 1E). PcTx1 (10 nM) completely inhibited ASIC1a, but the effect
was rapidly reversible on peptide washout (τoff = 6.2 min for rASIC1a,
0.99 min for hASIC1a; Fig. 1F and Fig. S2). In striking contrast, current
inhibition by 10 nM Hi1a was only slowly reversible (τoff = 14.2 min
for rASIC1a, 31.8 min for hASIC1a), with ∼40% recovery of current
amplitude after a 30-min washout (Fig. 1F and Fig. S2). Such slow
reversibility has not been reported for any other ASIC modulator.
Hi1a Inhibits Activation of ASIC1a. PcTx1 binds to the acidic pocket of
ASIC1a (16, 17), a key proton-binding site on the channel (18), and
promotes steady-state desensitization (SSD) (19). In contrast to PcTx1,
which causes a surmountable shift in the pH dependence of activation
and SSD to more alkaline values (19), Hi1a-induced inhibition is sub-
stantially less pH-dependent, as evidenced by only small alkaline shifts
in the pH50 of SSD in the absence and presence of peptide, and this
effect is insurmountable (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3A). In addition, in contrast
to PcTx1, Hi1a induced a small acidic shift (0.18 pH units at 5 nM for
hASIC1a; Fig. S3A) and a noncompetitive inhibition of ASIC1a acti-
vation. Thus, despite the remarkable sequence similarity between PcTx1
and Hi1a, particularly in the N-terminal PcTx1-like domain, which
contains many of the key pharmacophore residues of PcTx1 (Fig. 1B)
(13, 20), Hi1a has substantially different functional activity, as demon-
strated by its incomplete, pH-independent inhibition and slow off-rate.
To further explore Hi1a’s unique mode of action, we obtained
macropatch and single-channel recordings of hASIC1a overexpressed in
HEK293 cells in the absence and presence of a saturating concentration
of Hi1a (5 nM). The macropatch recordings revealed that Hi1a induced
a marked reduction of peak current (78.6%; Fig. 2B) and a fivefold
decrease in the rate of hASIC1a activation. In contrast, the rates of
desensitization and current deactivation were barely affected (Fig. S3B).
In single-channel recordings, pre-exposure to Hi1a markedly increased
the activation lag time after acidification from 3.4 ms to 22 ms (Fig. 2C).
In contrast, all-points amplitude histograms revealed that the current
amplitude remained unchanged at 1.0 pA after Hi1a exposure, sug-
gesting that Hi1a does not affect ion permeation (Fig. 2D). Analysis of
the distributions of shut and open dwell times of single-channel activity
revealed additional, long-lived components for both shut and open
distributions after exposure to Hi1a (Fig. S3C).
Taken together, our TEVC, macropatch, and single-channel data
demonstrate that Hi1a induces a delay in the activation of ASIC1a,
suggesting that it binds to and stabilizes the closed state of the channel.
This is a strikingly different mode of action from that of PcTx1, which
stabilizes the desensitized state of ASIC1a (19, 21). From these data, we
infer that Hi1a slows the conformational rearrangements of ASIC1a
that underlie its transition from the resting state to a conducting state.
Hi1a Is a Double-Knot Peptide. The structure of PcTx1 (13, 16, 17, 22)
reveals that it forms an inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motif that is
common in spider venom peptides and typically provides them with a
high degree of thermal and chemical stability, as well as resistance to
proteases (23). The solution structure of Hi1a, which we determined
using a heteronuclear NMR approach (24), shows that it comprises two
homologous ICK domains connected via a short and structurally well-
defined linker (Fig. 3 A and B and Table S1). Thus, Hi1a is a member
of the recently described “double-knot” toxin family (25). The β-hairpin
loop is precisely defined in the C-terminal ICK domain but is more
disordered in the N-terminal domain, as has been noted for the
β-hairpin loop of PcTx1 (13), which houses most of the pharmacophore
residues (20). Because each ICK domain has both sequence and
structural similarity with PcTx1, we produced recombinant versions of
the N-terminal (Hi1a:N) and C-terminal (Hi1a:C) ICK domains and
tested whether they are active in isolation (Fig. 3 C and D). Hi1a:N
induced full inhibition of ASIC1a, but with markedly reduced potency
(IC50 ∼200-fold greater than that for either PcTx1 or Hi1a). Moreover,
in contrast with full-length Hi1a, this weak inhibition was rapidly

 reversible (Fig. 3F). Hi1a:C did not inhibit ASIC1a at all; rather, at
concentrations >1 μM, the C-terminal ICK domain caused minor po-
tentiation of channel currents.
Because Hi1a resembles two concatenated PcTx1-like domains, we
asked whether simply linking two copies of PcTx1 would recapitulate
the unique activity of Hi1a. An engineered peptide containing two
copies of PcTx1 joined by a short linker inhibited rASIC1a ∼200-fold
less potently than Hi1a (IC50 ∼63 nM; Fig. 3E). Moreover, like PcTx1,
but in contrast to Hi1a, this engineered double-knot peptide induced
full inhibition of ASIC1a currents. However, a chimeric double-knot
peptide comprising an N-terminal PcTx1 fragment joined to the
C-terminal ICK domain of Hi1a (PcTx1-Hi1a:C) potently inhibited
ASIC1a (IC50 1.27 nM; Fig. 3E), and, in contrast with PcTx1 and the
double-PcTx1 peptide, caused incomplete inhibition, similar to that
induced by Hi1a. We conclude that the unique mechanism of action of
Hi1a requires covalent linkage of the two ICK domains, with the
C-terminal domain imparting the unusual property of incomplete
channel inhibition at saturating peptide concentrations.
Residue F350 in rASIC1a is located on α-helix 5 adjacent to an
acidic pocket that is critical for proton gating of the channel (18).
Mutation of this residue to Ala abolishes the ability of PcTx1 to inhibit
ASIC1a (26). Similarly, we found that Hi1a was inactive on an F350A
mutant of rASIC1a (Fig. 3G), suggesting that the binding sites for
PcTx1 and Hi1a on ASIC1a overlap at least partly. Binding of Hi1a at
the acidic pocket is consistent with our hypothesis that the peptide
impedes the conformational rearrangements necessary for the resting
channel to transition into a conducting state.
Hi1a Protects the Brain After Stroke. Because PcTx1 protects against
stroke (14, 15), and Hi1a inhibits ASIC1a with higher potency and slower
reversibility than PcTx1, we investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of
Hi1a both in vitro and in vivo. In primary neuron/astrocyte cultures that

of activation and SSD of rASIC1a (Left) and hASIC1a (Right). Activation curves
were obtained by applying increasing concentrations of protons every 50 s. In
the continued presence of protons (pH <∼7.2 for rASIC1a), ASICs rapidly de-
sensitize and cannot reopen until sufficiently deprotonated (pH >∼7.3 for
rASIC1a), a phenomenon known as SSD. SSD profiles were obtained by condi-
tioning the channels for 120 s at decreasing pH. Data are mean ± SEM; n = 6.

 were oxidatively stressed with 0.3 mM H2O2, both PcTx1 and Hi1a
caused concentration-dependent increases in cell viability (Fig. S4);
however, at the highest concentration tested (100 nM), Hila provided
greater neuroprotection than PcTx1, with cell viability of 77% and 68%,
respectively (Fig. S4).
We next investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of Hi1a in a rat
model of focal cerebral ischemia. Stroke was induced in conscious,
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) by titrating endothelin-1 (ET-1)
above the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) via an indwelling cannula
to cause vessel occlusion and evoke stroke-induced behavior (14). This
vasoconstrictive stroke model more closely resembles human stroke
than mechanical occlusion models (3). A single small dose of Hi1a
(2 ng/kg) administered i.c.v. at 2, 4, or 8 h after stroke caused a marked
reduction in infarct size (Fig. 4 A and B). Strikingly, Hi1a afforded
protection not only in the penumbral (cortical) zone, but also in the
ischemic (striatal) core, which is the tissue directly impacted by hypoxia
and is generally considered refractory to therapeutic intervention (2).
These findings are consistent with the preservation of neuronal archi-
tecture in both the penumbral and core regions of damage, as evidenced
by intact neuronal staining (Fig. 4E), and were reflected symptomati-
cally, with the Hi1a-treated animals exhibiting markedly reduced neu-
rological deficit (Fig. 4C) and motor impairment (Fig. 4D).
The neuroprotective efficacy of Hi1a is not due simply to an ability
to cause vasodilation, because it did not modify the ET-1–evoked
vasoconstriction of isolated cerebral arteries even at concentrations as
high as 100 nM (Fig. S5A). Vascular tone in Hi1a-treated arteries was
similar to that in time controls, despite the fact that these vessels fully
dilated in response to the vasodilator papaverine (Fig. S5B).
Discussion
Hi1a Provides a Long Time Window for Neuroprotection After Stroke.
Stroke is the second-leading cause of death worldwide (27) and the
primary cause of serious long-term disability (28), with treatment of
stroke accounting for ∼3% of global healthcare expenditures (29).
Despite this massive disease burden, the use of tissue plasminogen
activator (tPA) to help restore blood flow remains the only Food and
Drug Administration-approved agent for treatment of ischemic stroke.
Moreover, tPA is used in only 3–4% of stroke patients (30), owing to
its relatively narrow therapeutic window and the risk of inducing in-
tracranial hemorrhage (1, 31). Currently, there are no approved ther-
apeutic agents for treating the neuronal damage caused by stroke (5).
Neuroprotective drugs would need to have long time window for
therapeutic efficacy, given that ∼60% of stroke patients do not reach
an emergency room until at least 2 h after stroke onset (3), and many
patients do not receive medical care until much later.
In this study, we have demonstrated that inhibition of ASIC1a using
Hi1a provides exceptional levels of neuroprotection even when the
peptide is administered up to 8 h after stroke onset. Along with facili-
tating a substantially reduced level of penumbral damage, Hi1a is unique
in providing some protection of the striatal core region, which is generally
considered therapeutically unrecoverable owing to rapid and irreversible
necrotic cell death (2). Importantly, we have shown that the reduction in
infarct volume in Hi1a-treated animals translates to improved behavioral
outcomes, with a marked decrease in neurological deficits and motor
impairment. We observed no adverse effects during the 72-h observation
period following i.c.v. administration of Hi1a, consistent with previous
work showing that central or peripheral administration of ASIC inhibi-
tors does not produce unwanted side effects (32).
Mechanistic Basis of Hi1a’s Neuroprotective Efficacy. Hi1a is the most
potent inhibitor of ASIC1a described to date; its IC50 of ∼500 pM for the
inhibition of both rASIC1a and hASIC1a makes it approximately twofold
more potent than PcTx1. Hi1a comprises two ICK domains that have
strong sequence homology with PcTx1, and its 3D structure resembles
two concatenated PcTx1 molecules joined by a structured linker. Both
peptides are highly neuroprotective in MCAO models of stroke. Despite
these similarities, Hi1a and PcTx1 have distinctly different mechanisms of
action. PcTx1 binds to the acidic pocket of ASIC1a to promote de-
sensitization of the channel (19). In contrast, although the binding site for
Hi1a overlaps with that of PcTx1 (Fig. 3G), Hi1a delays the activation of
ASIC1a (Fig. 2), suggesting that it binds to and stabilizes the closed state
of the channel. Moreover, Hi1a causes incomplete channel block even at
saturating peptide concentrations, and its inhibition of ASIC1a is less
readily reversible than that of PcTx1. The slower reversibility of Hi1a, as
well as its pH-independent inhibition of ASIC1a, may provide a greater
“effective dose” than an equivalent amount of PcTx1 over a range of
extracellular conditions, whereas the residual channel activity even at
saturating doses of Hi1a might be important for retaining normal phys-
iological functions of brain ASIC1a, which remain unclear.

PHARMACOLOGY
 Hi1a was neuroprotective even when administered 8 h after onset of
ET-1–mediated MCAO. Although we did not determine the degree
and duration of ET-1–mediated cerebral ischemia, previous studies
have reported either complete or partial recovery of blood flow at 8 h
after stroke (33–35). In this context, we have shown that the neuro-
protection afforded by Hi1a is unlikely to result from a vasodilatory
effect, given that it did not reverse ET-1–mediated vasoconstriction of
isolated cerebral arteries.
It was recently shown that acidosis induces neuronal necroptosis via
direct association of activated ASIC1a with RIP1 kinase independent
of ASIC1a’s ion-conducting function (36), consistent with RIP1’s
function as a crucial mediator of necroptosis (37). An indirect effect of
Hi1a on RIP1 activation might explain its ability to provide some
protection of the striatal region, which is thought to undergo rapid
necrotic cell death following cerebral ischemia. However, pharmaco-
logical inhibition of RIP1 only marginally reduces infarct size (∼15%)
at 6 h after MCAO (38), whereas Hi1a provides much higher levels of
protection at up to 8 h after stroke induction. Thus, it remains to be
determined whether inhibition of RIP1 recruitment contributes to the
neuroprotective efficacy of Hi1a. In future preclinical studies, it also
will be critical to examine stroke outcomes over several weeks, to
ensure that the neuroprotective effects of Hi1a are not transient.
Materials and Methods
Analysis of the H. infensa Transcriptome. Three specimens of H. infensa were
collected from Orchid Beach, Fraser Island, Australia and milked exhaustively
to induce transcription of toxin genes. Three days later, the spiders were
anesthetized, and venom glands were dissected into TRIzol (Life Technolo-
gies). Total RNA was extracted using standard methods, then mRNA enrich-
ment was performed using an Oligotex Direct mRNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA
quality and concentration were determined using a Bioanalyzer 2100 in-
strument (Agilent Technologies), and 100 ng of mRNA was used to prepare a
cDNA library. Sequencing was performed at the Australian Genome Research
Facility using a Roche GS FLX sequencer. Low-quality sequences were discarded
using a Phred score cutoff of 25. De novo assembly was performed using MIRA
(39), and the data were visualized using Tablet (40) or Geneious (41). Signal
sequences were identified using SignalP (42), and propeptide cleavage sites
were predicted based on a sequence logo analysis of spider toxin precursors in
the ArachnoServer database (43).
Production of Recombinant Peptides. Hi1a and analogs were produced using an
E. coli periplasmic expression system developed for disulfide-rich peptides (44).
In brief, a synthetic gene encoding the peptide was subcloned into an ex-
pression vector that enables periplasmic expression of the peptide as a His6-
MBP fusion protein, with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site
sandwiched between the MBP and peptide-coding regions (44). E. coli BL21
(λDE3) cells transformed with the vector were grown at 30 °C, induced with
0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at OD600 = 0.8–1.3, then grown
overnight at 16 °C. After cell disruption at 32 kpsi (TS Series Cell Disrupter;
Constant Systems), the His6-MBP-peptide fusion protein was captured by
passing the cell lysate (buffered in 20 mM Tris·HCl and 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.8)
over Ni-NTA Superflow Resin (Qiagen). The resin was washed with 10 mM
imidazole to remove weakly bound contaminants, after which the fusion
protein was eluted with 400 mM imidazole, concentrated to 5 mL, and then
cleaved overnight at room temperature with TEV protease. The liberated
recombinant peptide was then isolated to >95% purity using reversed-phase
HPLC. Note that for all peptides, a nonnative serine residue was added at the N
terminus to facilitate TEV cleavage.
NMR. The structure of Hi1a was determined from heteronuclear NMR data
acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker 900-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-
resonance cryogenic probe using a sample of 13C/15N-labeled Hi1a [300 μM in
20 mM Mes, 0.02% NaN3, and 5% (vol/vol) D2O]. Backbone resonance assign-
ments were obtained from 2D 1H-15N-HSQC, 2D 1H-13C-HSQC, 3D HNCACB, 3D
CBCA(CO)NH, 3D HNCO, and 3D HBHA(CO)NH spectra, whereas side chain as-
signments relied on a 4D HCC(CO)NH-TOCSY (45). The 3D and 4D spectra were
acquired using nonuniform sampling and processed using maximum entropy
reconstruction (45). Chemical shift assignments have been deposited in Bio-
MagResBank (accession no. 25848). Distance restraints for structure calculations
were derived from 3D 13C-aliphatic, 13C-aromatic, and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC
spectra (mixing time, 200 ms) acquired using uniform sampling. SPARKY (www.
cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/) was used for peak picking and integration of NOESY
spectra, and then peak lists were assigned and structures calculated using CYANA
3.0 (46). Disulfide-bond connectivities were determined unambiguously in the first
round of structure calculations, and corresponding disulfide-bond restraints (47)
were applied in subsequent rounds. Backbone dihedral-angle restraints derived
from TALOS+ (48) were also used in structure calculations. CYANA was used to
calculate 200 structures from random starting conformations; then the 20 con-
formers with highest stereochemical quality as judged by MolProbity (49) were
selected to represent the structure of Hi1a. Coordinates for the Hi1a ensemble are
available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID code 2N8F).
TEVC. The TEVC experiments were carried out using Xenopus laevis oocytes
expressing rat or human ASICs (13, 20). Stage V-VI oocytes were injected with
4 ng of cRNA encoding rASIC1a, hASIC1a, rASIC1b, rASIC2a, or rASIC3, and
recordings were made 1–5 d later at room temperature (18–21 °C) in ND96
solution containing 0.05% fatty acid-free BSA. Changes in extracellular pH
were induced using a microperfusion system that allowed local, rapid ex-
change of solutions. Hepes was replaced by Mes to buffer the pH 6.0 stimulus
solution. The control extracellular solution comprised 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl,
1.8 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM Hepes. Peptides were dissolved in ND96
solution (pH 7.45) containing 0.05% BSA to prevent adsorption onto tubing.
Single-Channel Recordings. HEK293 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding
hASIC1a. Recordings were performed at 22 ± 1 °C at a clamped potential of
−70 mV, in the outside-out patch patch-clamp configuration. The intracellular
solution comprised 145 mM CsCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, and
5 mM EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH. The control extracellular solution
comprised 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes,
and 10 mM D-glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The activating extracel-
lular solution was identical to the control, except that 10 mM Mes was used
instead of Hepes and the solution was titrated to pH 6.0 with NaOH. All working
solutions also contained 0.01% BSA. Macropatch currents were generated by
rapidly switching solutions across the patch using a piezoelectric stepper (rise
time, ∼150 μs). Single-channel and macropatch currents were recorded using an
Axon 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered (−3 dB, four-pole Bessel) at
5 kHz, and sampled at 20 kHz. Macropatch currents were analyzed using
pClamp10 (Molecular Devices). Between 10 and 20 macropatch currents were
elicited from the same patch and averaged for measurement of rise, de-
sensitization, and deactivation times. Group means were tested for significance
using a paired t test, with P < 0.01 as the significance threshold. Activation lag
time estimates represent median and 25th and 75th percentile values.
The 10–100% region of the rising phase of the current was fitted to the
exponential equation I(t) = Imax [1 – exp (–t/τ)], where Imax is the peak current
amplitude, τ is the time constant, and t is time. A single standard exponential
equation was used to fit the desensitization phase of the current. Two standard
exponential equations fit the deactivation phase of the current, and a
weighted time constant was calculated using the equation τw = (τ1A1 + τ2A2)/
(A1 + A2), where τw is the weighted time constant for current deactivation and
τn and An are individual time constants and corresponding fractions, re-
spectively. Single-channel currents were analyzed using pClamp 10 and QuB.
Shut and open dwell histograms were generated from idealized single-channel
currents at a resolution (dead time) of 100 μs and fitted to a mixture
of exponentials.
In Vitro Neuroprotection Assay. Oxidative stress was induced in primary cortical
neuronal-astrocytic cultures by incubation with 0.3 mM H2O2. Then cell viability
in the presence/absence of Hi1a or PcTx1 (1–100 nM) was assessed using a
colorimetric assay. More details are provided in Fig. S4.
Stroke Experiments. We used a focal reperfusion model of stroke in conscious
SHRs (14). Two 23-gauge stainless steel guide cannulae were stereotaxically
implanted into anesthetized animals (ketamine 75 mg/kg; xylazine 10 mg/kg
i.p.) at 5 d before stroke induction. The first cannula was implanted 3 mm dorsal
to the right MCA for stroke induction. The second cannula was implanted into
the left lateral ventricle for drug administration. After 5 d of recovery, stroke
was induced by inserting a 30-gauge injector protruding 3 mm below the
previously implanted cannula and administering ET-1 (20 pmol/μL) at a rate of
0.2 μL every 30 s until the animal exhibited stroke-induced behaviors, including
continuous ipsilateral circling, clenching, dragging, failure to extend the left
contralateral forelimb, chewing, jaw flexing, and shuffling with forepaws (level
4 stroke). These motor deficits correlate with stroke severity (50) and provide a
consistent benchmark for stroke induction in conscious rats. Only animals that
achieved a level 4 stroke were included in the study. Animals that showed
behaviors exceeding a level 4 stroke (e.g., complete loss of balance, excessive
spinning) were excluded and humanely euthanized. Animals that had a rectal
temperature >40 °C during the 3 h after stroke induction, lost >10% body
weight, failed to feed and drink, or lacked spontaneous movement were

 excluded as well. Animals were randomly allocated to vehicle or Hi1a treatment
group before the initiation of stroke induction and the experimenter (C.M.) was
blinded to all treatments and histological analyses. At 2, 4, or 8 h after stroke,
SHRs were treated with a single i.c.v. dose of Hi1a (2 ng/kg) or saline using a 30-
gauge injector protruding 3 mm below the guide cannula. Drugs were dis-
solved in saline and infused in a volume of 3 μL over 3 min.
Stroke-induced motor deficit was assessed by counting foot faults while the
rat traversed a gradually narrowing ledged beam (14, 50). Animals were trained
to traverse the beam on 2 consecutive days before prestroke assessment. Pos-
tural abnormalities were assessed by elevating the rat by the tail above a flat
surface and grading the severity of thorax twisting and angle of forelimb ex-
tension. These indicators of neurologic health were scored between 0 and 3,
with a score of 0 corresponding to no twisting of the thorax or complete
forelimb extension toward the flat surface, and a score of 3 corresponding to
severe thorax twisting and failure to extend the forelimb. The scores for thorax
twisting and forelimb extension were summed to give a total possible neuro-
logic score of 6, which represents severe neurologic deficit. Behavioral tests
were performed before stroke and at 24 and 72 h after stroke. At 72 h post-
stroke, rats were reanesthetized (ketamine 75 mg/kg; xylazine 10 mg/kg i.p.)
and transcardially perfused with physiologically buffered saline. Brains were
removed, snap-frozen, and sectioned (16 μm) at eight predetermined forebrain
levels (–3.20 mm to 6.8 mm relative to bregma). Sections were imaged, and
infarct volumes were measured in all brain sections using the ballistic light
method and corrected for edema (14, 50).
Cerebral Artery Vascular Tone. Brains were rapidly removed from euthanized
male SHR and placed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid. A distal segment of the MCA
(109 ± 10 μm; n = 7 arteries) was isolated and transferred to a pressure myo-
graph chamber (Living Systems Instrumentation). Vessels were cannulated and
pressurized to 60 mmHg. After a 30-min equilibration period, vessels were sub-
maximally constricted (∼25% of postequilibration diameter) with ET-1 (1–10 nM).
Cumulative concentration-response curves were then performed to either vehicle
(0.9% saline) or Hi1a (1–100 nM). Arteries were then treated with papaverine
(100 μM) to obtain maximum diameters.
