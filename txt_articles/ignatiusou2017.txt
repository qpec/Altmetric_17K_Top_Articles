Abstract 
Resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with 
activating EGFR mutations generally involve development of acquired secondary or tertiary 
EGFR mutations, such as T790M or C797S. However, case reports have demonstrated that 
actionable receptor tyrosine kinase fusions such as EML4-ALK, CCDC6-RET, and FGFR3-TACC3 
can potentially confer resistance to EGFR TKIs. We seeked to identify the prevalence of FGFR3-
TACC3 fusion transcripts as resistance mechanism to EGFR TKIs. Hybrid-capture based genomic 
profiling was performed on FFPE tissue samples and circulating tumor DNA isolated from 
peripheral whole blood in the course of clinical care. We performed a comprehensive survey of 
17,319 clinical NSCLC samples (14,170 adenocarcinomas and 3,149 NSCLC not otherwise 
specified (NOS)) and identified 5 cases of FGFR3-TACC3 containing the intact kinase domain of 
FGFR3 and the coiled-coil domain of TACC3 emerging after treatment with EGFR TKIs, including 
one previously reported index case. Of the 4 novel cases of FGFR3-TACC3, one emerged after 
erlotinib, one after afatinib, one after osimertinib, and one after ASP8273. These 5 cases of 
FGFR3-TACC3 fusions acquired post-EGFR TKI, while rare, indicate that FGFR3-TACC3 is a 
recurrent resistance mechanism, which can bypass EGFR blockade by all generations of EGFR 
TKIs in NSCLC. Routine re-biopsy and genomic profiling using platforms capable of detecting 
  
3 
kinase fusions has the potential to inform new therapeutic strategies for patients with EGFR-
mutant NSCLC progressing on TKIs. 
 
Introduction 
 
The majority of reported acquired resistance mechanisms to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs) generally involve mutations in the kinase domain which alter drug binding and/or ATP 
affinity, including T790M, which mediates resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs 
[1,2], and C797S, which mediates resistance to the third-generation EGFR TKI such as 
osimertinib [3,4]. MET amplification is another recognized resistance mechanism to all 
generations of EGFR TKIs. Other common resistance mechanisms include bypass pathway 
activation, via mechanisms such as MET amplification, and small cell transformation, both of 
which have been observed as resistance mechanism to all generations of EGFR TKIs [1,2,5,6]. 
Recently, reports have identified known oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) fusions 
(CCDC6-RET, FGFR3-TACC3, EML4-ALK) emerging after disease progression on EGFR TKIs [7-9]. 
Hence we performed a survey of the genomic database of Foundation Medicine, Inc for cases 
with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions that also had co-existing activating EGFR mutations.  
Materials and Methods 
Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on tissue samples using the FoundationOne® 
assay as previously described [10]. Briefly, DNA was extracted from 40 µM of FFPE sections 
(generally 10 unstained 4 M slides), and CGP (Comprehensive Genomic Profiling) was 
performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage 
depth of >550X for 236 or 315 cancer-related genes plus select introns from 19 or 28 genes 
  
4 
frequently rearranged in cancer. Genomic profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using the 
assay FoundationACT™ assay was performed as described previously [11] where two 10 mL 
aliquots of peripheral, whole blood were collected in proprietary, stabilizing collection tubes. A 
double spin protocol was used to isolate plasma and 50-100 ng of ctDNA was extracted to 
create adapted sequencing libraries prior to hybrid capture and sample-multiplexed sequencing 
on an Illumina HSQ2500. This ctDNA test covers 62 genes to >3,000x unique coverage and 
employs propriety algorithms to call alterations at low allele frequencies (0.1% for 
substitutions, 1% for indels and rearrangements, and 20% for copy-number amplifications). 
Mutant allele frequency (MAF) for the tissue-based assay represents the percentage of DNA 
obtained from the biopsied tumor which contains the mutation.  In the blood, MAF represents 
the percentage of ctDNA in the blood stream harboring the mutation on the given day and time 
of specimen procurement. MAF for the tissue assay and ctDNA assays cannot be directly 
compared. Both assays are validated and performed on similar Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA)-certified genomic profiling platforms (Foundation Medicine, Inc., 
Cambridge, MA). Approval for this study, including a waiver of informed consent and a HIPAA 
waiver of authorization, was obtained from the Western Institutional Review Board (Protocol 
No. 20152817). 
 
Results 
We surveyed 17,319 clinical lung cancer samples (14,170 adenocarcinomas and 3,149 NSCLC 
not otherwise specified (NOS)) submitted between August 2012 and March 2017. We identified 
a total of 5 cases of FGFR3-TACC3 fusions and activating EGFR mutations in the setting of 
  
5 
known resistance to EGFR TKIs. No co-occurring FGFR3 fusions and EGFR activating mutations 
were identified in 2,609 cases of lung squamous cell carcinoma. One of the five cases has been 
reported [8], and here we report the 4 additional cases identified. All fusions involved the 
complete FGFR3 kinase domain and were predicted to be in frame. 
 
Case 1. Patient is a 49-old Asian female never-smoker who presented with stage IV 
adenocarcinoma of the lung. Her tumor was submitted for CGP, which revealed only EGFR exon 
19 deletion (ex19del), TP53 Y163C, and RB1 loss (Table 1). She received afatinib and achieved a 
partial response (PR) by RECIST for 16 months in the primary tumor before appearance of new 
metastatic nodules (Figure 1) and eventual progression of her primary tumor. Because of the 
location and size of the primary tumor and pulmonary nodules (Figure 1A), a plasma-based 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay was performed as previously described [10] and revealed 
the original EGFR ex19del as well as an acquired FGFR3-TACC3 fusion (F18; T10) (Figure 1B). 
Details of the detected genomic changes pre- and post-EGFR TKI are listed in Table 1. The 
patient is currently receiving carboplatin/pemetrexed chemotherapy with response after two 
cycles of chemotherapy (Figure 1A). 
Case 2. Patient was a 45-year-old male with EGFR ex19del positive stage IV NSCLC who 
achieved a PR on erlotinib for 8 months. On progression, CGP revealed the original EGFR 
ex19del and EGFR T790M resistance mutation. The patient was treated on a clinical trial with a 
third-generation EGFR TKI, ASP8273. After achieving a PR for another 8 months, the patient’s 
disease again progressed and repeat tumor biopsy was performed. CGP of this sample revealed 
loss of EGFR T790M mutation, but the emergence of FGFR3-TACC3 (F18; T7) (Figure 1B) and 
  
6 
retention of the original activating EGFR ex19del mutation. Patient received palliative radiation 
and received osimertinib but passed away 2 months after discontinuation of ASP8273. 
Case 3. Patient was a 66-year-old female diagnosed with NSCLC positive for EGFR 
ex19del mutation identified by local testing. She was treated with erlotinib and achieved a PR 
(>80% tumor shrinkage) for 11 months prior to disease progression. She then received 4 cycles 
of paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab followed by maintenance erlotinib with bevacizumab for 
7 cycles. Upon subsequent disease progression she received 7 cycles of afatinib with cetuximab 
and whole brain radiation therapy for asymptomatic brain metastasis. At this time, CGP of a 
lung tumor biopsied at progression revealed FGFR3 amplification and FGFR3-TACC3 (F17; T11) 
(Figure 1B) as well as the primary EGFR ex19del mutation. The patient received gemcitabine 
and vinorelbine and then docetaxel with some clinical benefit. 
 
Case 4. Patient is a 74-year-old male diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma positive for 
EGFR ex19del by local testing. He was treated with erlotinib with a PR; however, after 5 months 
of therapy he developed pneumonitis and therapy was discontinued. Post-erlotinib, a blood 
sample was sent for analysis using a plasma-based ctDNA assay, which revealed EGFR T790M 
mutation in addition to the EGFR ex19del.  Osimertinib was begun and the patient had a PR 
lasting for approximately 4 months, when he presented with increasing symptoms and 
worsening disease on imaging. Upon progression on osimertinb a second blood sample was 
sent for ctDNA testing, and the T790M mutation was not detected; however, an FGFR3-TACC3 
(F18; T13) fusion (Figure 1B) and retention of the original EGFR ex19del mutation was observed. 
Subsequently, the patient received one dose of paclitaxel, but was hospitalized for symptom 
management and has now received two doses of nivolumab.

Discussion 
In addition to the first case report of an FGFR3-TACC3 fusion as potential resistance 
mechanism to EGFR TKI [8], herein, we report four additional cases of EGFR-mutated NSCLC 
with FGFR3-TACC3 fusions acquired post EGFR targeted therapy, implicating FGFR3-TACC3 
fusion as a rare but recurrent mechanism of acquired resistance to all three generations of 
EGFR TKIs (erlotinib, afatinib, osimeritnib, ASP8273). In each case, the acquired fusion occurred 
in the absence of other known mechanisms of resistance, and in 3 of 4 cases a prior sample was 
assayed on the same or similar platform and was negative for any FGFR alterations including 
kinase fusion. In this series, each FGFR3-TACC3 fusion results in C-terminal truncation of FGFR3 
(breakpoint in intron 17 or exon 18) with a retained kinase domain, fused to TACC3 
(breakpoints ranging between intron 6 and exon 13), which retains its coiled-coil dimerization 
domain (figure 1B). In two cases presented in this series T790M was no longer detected post-
osimertinib progression and instead the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion emerged as a potential resistance 
mechanism. FGFR3-TACC3 fusions have been reported in both squamous cell carcinoma [12,13] 
and adenocarcinoma of the lung [13,14]. Notably, the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcript was 
shown to activate Erk signaling to escape EGFR/ERBB3 blockade in a head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) xenograft model. Daly and colleagues demonstrated during 
combination antibody blockade of EGFR and ERBB3 in the HNSCC xenograft model that EGFR 
blockade preferentially inhibited Erk activation while ERBB3 blockade inhibited AKT activation. 
Upon progression of the xenograft, there was emergence of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts 
detected. Furthermore, introduction of FGFR3-TACC3 conferred resistance to osimertinib 
  
8 
inhibition of the NCI-H1975 (EGFR L858R + T790M) cell line, but did not confer resistance to 
PI3K inhibition of PI3K mutated cell lines [15].  
The observation that RTK fusions especially FGFR3-TACC3 can emerge as mechanisms of 
acquired resistance to all current generations of EGFR TKIs in EGFR-driven NSCLC is relatively 
new. For patients with FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive disease, there are no approved US FDA 
approved TKIs targeting FGFR, thus severely limiting options of combining FGFR inhibitors and 
EGFR TKIs. Although patient in case 1 responded to chemotherapy, given the multiple individual 
cases of acquired resistance presented herein, as well as the potentially prominent role of 
FGFR3-TACC3 fusions as driver alterations in a diverse group of malignancies, and the recent in 
vitro experiments suggesting that FGFR3-TACC3 can activate bypass signaling to circumvent 
EGFR blockade, development and approval of either pan-FGFR or specific FGFR3 inhibitors is 
urgently needed. This reports highlights the important role of analysis of repeat biopsies and 
ctDNA using well validated methods capable of sensitive detection of all classes of genomic 
alterations, including kinase fusions, to identify rare mechanisms of acquired resistance and 
guide future therapy selection.
