Abstract
Clothing treated with the pyrethroid permethrin is available in the United States as consumer products to prevent 
tick bites. We used tick bioassays to quantify contact irritancy and toxicity of permethrin-treated clothing for three 
important tick vectors of human pathogens: the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae); the lone 
star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae); and the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis (Say) 
(Acari: Ixodidae). 
We first demonstrated that field-collected I. scapularis nymphs from Minnesota were as susceptible 
as laboratory-reared nymphs to a permethrin-treated textile. Field ticks examined in bioassays on the same day 
they were collected displayed contact irritancy by actively dislodging from a vertically oriented permethrin-treated 
textile, and a forced 1-min exposure resulted in all ticks being unable to move normally, thus posing no more than 
minimal risk of biting, 1 h after contact with the treated textile. Moreover, we documented lack of normal movement 
for laboratory-reared I. scapularis nymphs by 1 h after contact for 1 min with a wide range of permethrin-treated 
clothing, including garments made from cotton, synthetic materials, and blends. A comparison of the impact of a 
permethrin-treated textile across tick species and life stages revealed the strongest effect on I. scapularis nymphs 
(0% with normal movement 1 h after a 1-min exposure), followed by A. americanum nymphs (14.0%), I. scapularis 
females (38.0%), D. variabilis females (82.0%), and A. americanum females (98.0%). Loss of normal movement for 
all ticks 1 h after contact with the permethrin-treated textile required exposures of 1 min for I. scapularis nymphs, 
2 min for A. americanum nymphs, and 5 min for female I. scapularis, D. variabilis, and A. americanum ticks. We 
conclude that use of permethrin-treated clothing shows promise to prevent bites by medically important ticks. 
Further research needs are discussed.

Numerous studies over the last four decades have shown that perme-
thrin-treated clothing is effective against tick vectors of human path-
ogens in the United States, including the blacklegged tick, Ixodes 
scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae); the lone star tick, Amblyomma 
americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae); and the American dog tick, 
Dermacentor variabilis (Say) (Acari: Ixodidae) (Schreck et al. 1978, 
1980, 1982, 1986; Mount and Snoddy 1983; Evans et al. 1990; 
Miller et al. 2011; Vaughn and Meshnick 2011; Jordan et al. 2012; 
Vaughn et al. 2014, Eisen et al. 2017a). In addition to the use of 
permethrin in pressurized sprays to self-treat clothing, refined meth-
odology for textile impregnation (Faulde and Uedelhoven 2006, 
Faulde et al. 2016) has led to new tick-protection consumer prod-
ucts in the form of permethrin-treated clothing. Insect Shield, LLC 
(Greensboro, NC) is a leading manufacturer of permethrin-treated 
clothing in the United States. In a previous study (Eisen et al. 2017a), 
we used material from a permethrin-treated T-shirt (100% cotton) 
from Insect Shield to develop a set of new bioassays to quantify con-
tact irritancy and toxicity of permethrin-treated clothing toward 
nymphal I. scapularis ticks, the primary vectors in eastern North 
America of the causative agents of Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and 
babesiosis (Eisen et al. 2017b). In addition to demonstrating con-
tact irritancy and toxicity of the tested permethrin-treated cotton 
textile for I. scapularis nymphs, we observed what appeared to be a 
weaker contact irritant ‘hot-foot’ effect for field-collected versus lab-
oratory-reared nymphs (Eisen et al. 2017a). However, in that study, 
the field-collected nymphs were held in the laboratory for ≥2 wk 
before being used, which may have affected their performance in the 
contact irritancy bioassay relative to the normal scenario of natur-
ally host-seeking nymphs encountering permethrin-treated clothing 
on a human in the field.

Here, we report on a set of studies where the new bioassays were 
used as follows: to 1) compare the contact irritancy and toxicity of 
a single type of permethrin-treated clothing for laboratory-reared 
versus field-collected I. scapularis nymphs; 2) compare the contact 
irritancy and toxicity of permethrin-treated clothing made from 
different types of textiles for I. scapularis nymphs; and 3) compare 
the toxicity of a single type of permethrin-treated clothing for the 
primary human-biting stages of I. scapularis (nymphs and females), 
A. americanum (nymphs and females), and D. variabilis (females).
Materials and Methods
Sources of Permethrin-Treated Clothing and Ticks
Ten different types of permethrin-treated clothing purchased dir-
ectly from Insect Shield were included in this study. Of these, three 
clothing items were 100% cotton (T-shirt, long sleeved shirt, and 
pants), three were 100% synthetic textile in the form of shirts 
(100% polyester shirt and 100% nylon shirt) or socks (85% cool-
wick/15% lycra spandex compression sock), and four were blends 
of cotton and synthetic textiles in the form of shirts (60% cot-
ton/40% polyester shirt and 50% cotton/50% polyester shirt) or 
socks (76% cotton/21% nylon/3% lycra sock and 49% polyes-
ter/47% cotton/3% rubber/1% spandex sock). All pieces of cloth-
ing were in pristine condition (not washed or worn) when used in 
the bioassays. The nontreated control textile was always a 100% 
cotton T-shirt. Textile pieces for use in the bioassays were cut from 
the front or back of the shirts, the lower legs of the pants, and the 
upper part of socks that extend above a shoe.
Laboratory-reared ticks used in the study were obtained from the 
Oklahoma State University (OSU) Tick Rearing Facility (Stillwater, 
OK). These included I. scapularis nymphs and females, A. america-
num nymphs and females, and D. variablis females, all of unknown 
age. Prior to being used, the ticks were held within glass desiccators 
(90–95% RH) in a growth chamber maintained at 21 to 22°C with 
a 16:8 h light:dark cycle. The lone exception was for OSU I. scapu-
laris nymphs that were used in the field together with field-collected 
I. scapularis nymphs: these OSU ticks were placed in plastic desic-
cators equipped with water and held under ambient conditions, in 
the same complex where the bioassays were performed at the Camp 
Ripley Training Center, Morrison County, MN, for approximately 
1 wk prior to being used in bioassays. Field-collected I. scapularis 
nymphs came from sites at the Camp Ripley Training Center. These 
ticks were collected from vegetation from 21 to 24 June 2017, using 
white cotton utility cloths as tick drags. All nymphs were used in 
bioassays the same day they were collected, typically within 4 h of 
collection.
Contact Irritancy and 
Toxicity Bioassays
Our vertical (45° angle) bioassay to assess contact irritancy was 
described in detail previously (Eisen et al. 2017a) and contains a 
playing card (64-mm wide by 89-mm tall) onto which a test textile 
is sewn. Ticks are introduced onto the center of the textile-covered 
card and the number remaining on the card is scored at 1-min inter-
vals over a 5-min period. We found this bioassay to be suitable for 
nymphal ticks but not for the more mobile adult ticks, as these dis-
lodged very quickly even from cards with nontreated control textile. 
Based on their variable mobility, we found it convenient to observe 
ticks within groups of 10 I. scapularis nymphs or 5 A. americanum 
nymphs per bioassay. After exposure, ticks were held in desiccators 
(90–95% RH) at room temperature in the laboratory or at ambi-
ent temperature in the field setting until scored for vigor 24 h later. 
Bioassays with nontreated control textile universally had survival 
rates of ≥90% at 24 h post-exposure.
Our bioassay to assess toxicity was described in detail previously 
(Eisen et al. 2017a) and is performed by keeping ticks in continuous 
contact with a horizontally oriented treated test textile or nontreated 
control material for a given period of time. In this study, we used 
exposure durations of 1, 2, and 5 min. Based on their variable mobil-
ity, we found it convenient to use groups of 10 I. scapularis nymphs, 
5 A. americanum nymphs, or 5 female ticks of any species per bio-
assay. Nymphal ticks were exposed using a 10-cm diameter textile 
circle placed within a Petri dish, whereas the more mobile females 
were exposed on a larger, 18- × 13-cm piece of textile affixed within 
a plastic tray. After exposure, ticks were held in desiccators (90–95% 
RH) at room temperature in the laboratory until scored for vigor 1 
and 24 h later. Bioassays with nontreated control material uniformly 
had survival rates of ≥90% at 24 h post-exposure.
Bioassays to compare the impact of permethrin-treated clothing 
made from different types of textiles were restricted to laboratory-
reared I. scapularis nymphs. Bioassays to compare the impact of per-
methrin-treated clothing on laboratory-reared versus field-collected 
I. scapularis nymphs, or the primary human-biting life stages of dif-
ferent tick species, were restricted to a single type of permethrin-
treated clothing (100% cotton).
Classification Scheme for Vigor of Ticks
We used the post-exposure classification scheme for tick vigor 
described previously by Eisen et al. (2017a). Briefly, tick vigor fol-
lowing introduction onto a nontreated surface and stimulation of 
activity via gentle physical prodding and human breath was scored 
across four categories of capacity for movement: 1) tick completely 
motionless; 2) tick capable of some movement of the legs but unable 
to right itself or walk; 3) tick capable of righting itself but not able 
to move in a coordinated way or readily orient toward a stimulus; 
and 4) tick displaying normal movement and response to a stimu-
lus. Ticks scored as displaying normal movement (4) were further 
assessed to determine whether they would ascend onto a finger when 
given the chance.
Data Analysis
We compared proportions of ticks presenting various responses to 
permethrin-treated clothing to those exposed to nontreated con-
trols using Fisher’s exact test. Results were considered significant at 
α = 0.05, using a one-tailed test. All comparisons were conducted in 
JMP Pro 13 (Cary, NC).
Results
Contact Irritancy and 
Toxicity of a Single 
Type of 
Permethrin-Treated Clothing for Laboratory-Reared 
Versus Field-Collected I. scapularis Nymphs
In the contact irritancy assay, the percentage of ticks remaining on 
the assay card after 1 min was significantly (P < 0.0001) lower for 
the permethrin-treated textile compared with the nontreated con-
trol textile, both for the laboratory-reared nymphs (57.5 and 100%, 
respectively) and the field-collected nymphs (32.5 and 85.0%, 
respectively) (Table 1). By the end of the 5-min observation period, 
the difference was even more pronounced for the laboratory-reared 
nymphs, with 100% of nymphs still on the nontreated control but 
only 5.0% remaining on the permethrin-treated textile (P < 0.0001). 
The field-collected nymphs were far more active and less likely to 
remain on the assay card with nontreated control textile for the full

5 min. Nevertheless, they were still marginally less likely to remain 
on the permethrin-treated textile compared with the nontreated con-
trol textile at the 5-min time point (7.5 and 22.5%, respectively; 
P = 0.0574). Moreover, the percentage of ticks displaying normal 
movement 24 h post-exposure was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced 
following contact with permethrin-treated textile compared with the 
nontreated control textile, both for the laboratory-reared nymphs 
(25.0 and 100%, respectively) and the field-collected nymphs (45.0 
and 100%, respectively) (Table 1). And even fewer ticks both dis-
played normal movement and were willing to ascend the tip of a 
finger when given the opportunity (Table 1). For the field-collected 
nymphs, exposure to permethrin-treated textile resulted in only 
17.5% both displaying normal movement and climbing onto a fin-
ger 24 h post-exposure, compared with 80.0% for exposure to non-
treated control textile (P < 0.0001).
In the toxicity assay, continuous contact with test textile for 
1 min resulted in significant (P < 0.0001) reductions (≥90 percent-
age points) for the probability of ticks to display normal move-
ment after exposure to permethrin-treated textile compared with 
the nontreated control textile, regardless of whether we assayed 
laboratory-reared or field-collected nymphs and whether tick vigor 
was scored at 1 or 24 h post-exposure (Table 2). Of special note is 
that no field-collected nymphs displayed normal movement 1 h after 
1-min exposure to the permethrin-treated textile, and that only 5% 
of nymphs having been exposed for such a brief period of time had 
recovered normal movement 24 h after exposure. For the field-col-
lected nymphs, 1-min exposure to permethrin-treated textile resulted 
in only 2.5% both displaying normal movement and climbing onto 
a finger 24 h post-exposure, compared with 52.5% for exposure to 
nontreated control textile (P < 0.0001).
Contact Irritancy and 
Toxicity of Permethrin-Treated 
Clothing Made From Different 
Types of 
Textiles for 
Laboratory-Reared I. scapularis Nymphs
The main findings in the contact irritancy assay were that, compared 
with nontreated control textile, exposure to permethrin-treated tex-
tile resulted in significant reductions (P < 0.0001) in the percentage 
of ticks remaining on the assay card after 5 min for 9 of 10 different 
types of treated clothing, and in the percentage of ticks displaying 
normal movement 24 h post-exposure for all 10 different types of 
treated clothing (Table 3). Notably, the percentage of ticks display-
ing normal movement 24 h post-exposure was reduced to ≤20.0% 
for all tested types of treated clothing and to <5.0% for 6 of 10 
types of treated clothing. We also note that one of the sock textiles 
examined—a 49% polyester/47% cotton/3% rubber/1% spandex 
sock—had a unique combined impact in that nymphs failed to dis-
lodge from it but were severely affected and uniformly were unable 
to move normally 24 h post-exposure.
In the toxicity assay, a 2-min exposure led to lack of normal 
movement 1 and 24 h post-exposure for all ticks exposed to treated 
textile, regardless of the type of clothing (Table 4). This represented 
significant (P < 0.0001) decreases in normal movement at 1 and 
24 h post-exposure for all treated textiles compared with nontreated 
control textile (100 and 98.0% of nymphs with normal movement, 
respectively). When the exposure time was reduced to 1 min, lack of

normal movement for all ticks by 1 and 24 h post-exposure was still 
recorded for 6 of 10 types of treated textile. Exposure to the other 
four types of treated textile resulted in lack of normal movement for 
all ticks 1 h post-exposure but variable likelihood (8.0–36.0%) of 
recovery of normal movement by 24 h post-exposure. These results 
for the 1-min contact time represented significant (P < 0.0001) 
decreases in normal movement at 1 and 24 h post-exposure for all 
treated textiles compared with nontreated control textile.
Contact Irritancy of a Single 
Type of Permethrin-
Treated Clothing for Laboratory-Reared Nymphal 
I. scapularis and A. americanum Ticks
The percentage of ticks remaining on the assay card after 1 min was 
significantly (P < 0.0001) lower for the permethrin-treated textile 
compared with the nontreated control textile, both for I. scapu-
laris nymphs (44.0 and 98.0%, respectively) and A. americanum 
nymphs (6.0 and 48.0%, respectively) (Table 5). The irritant effect 
of the treated textile was even more pronounced for I. scapularis 
nymphs after the full 5-min observation period, with only 2.0% of 
ticks remaining on the treated textile but 94.0% remaining on the 
nontreated control textile (P < 0.0001). Observation periods beyond 
1 min were counter-productive for the very mobile A. americanum 
nymphs as >80% of ticks had dislodged from the nontreated control 
textile already by 2 min. Most likely due to rapid dislodgement of 
A. americanum nymphs from the treated textile, the percentage of 
ticks displaying normal movement 24 h after contact was similar for 
those exposed to nontreated and treated clothing. By contrast, both 
normal movement of I. scapularis nymphs and normal movement 
combined with willingness to climb a finger 24 h post-exposure were 
significantly reduced for ticks exposed to permethrin-treated cloth-
ing compared with nontreated clothing (P < 0.0001) (Table 5).
Toxicity of a Single 
Type of Permethrin-Treated 
Clothing for Different 
Tick Species and Life Stages
Continuous exposures to treated textile revealed a general trend 
of decreasing sensitivity (i.e., increasing likelihood of retaining 
the ability to move normally 1 h post-exposure) from I. scapula-
ris nymphs (0% with normal movement after a 1-min exposure) 
to A. americanum nymphs (14.0%), I. scapularis females (38.0%), 
D. variabilis females (82.0%), and A. americanum females (98.0%) 
(Table 6). Loss of normal movement for all ticks 1 h after contact 
with the treated textile required exposures of 1 min for I. scapularis 
nymphs, 2 min for A. americanum nymphs, and 5 min for female 
I. scapularis, D. variabilis, and A. americanum ticks. Recovery of 
normal movement from 1 to 24 h after contact with permethrin-
treated clothing was recorded for some (8.0%) I. scapularis nymphs 
exposed for 1 min but not for longer (2 or 5 min) exposures. For 
A. americanum nymphs, 50.0–60.0% of ticks recovered normal 
movement from 1 to 24 h after contact that lasted for 1–2 min, 
compared with only 10.0% following a 5-min exposure. Patterns 
for females were less clear cut across the shorter contact times but 
for all three species we recorded recovery of females for the 5-min 
contact from 1 h after exposure (0% capable of normal movement 
for all species) to 24 h after exposure (14.0–24.0% capable of nor-
mal movement). Another interesting observation was that, in con-
trast to I. scapularis and A. americanum females, shorter (1–2 min)

exposures for D. variabilis females appeared to result in a slow poi-
soning effect resulting in successive loss of normal movement over 
time: for example, following a 1-min exposure normal movement in 
the females fell from 82% 1 h later to 58% by 24 h (Table 6).
Discussion
Our bioassay findings indicate that permethrin-treated clothing 
has promise as a personal protective measure to prevent bites by 
medically important ticks in the United States. This agrees with the 
findings of previous studies where use of permethrin-treated clothing 
reduced the risk of bites by I. scapularis, A. americanum, and D. var-
iabilis under field conditions or simulated field conditions (Schreck 
et al. 1980, 1982, 1986; Mount and Snoddy 1983; Evans et al. 1990; 
Miller et al. 2011; Vaughn and Meshnick 2011; Vaughn et al. 2014). 
Of special note in our study is the very strong impact of permethrin-
treated clothing on nymphal I. scapularis ticks, which are considered 
the primary vectors in the United States of seven human pathogens 
including the causative agents of Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and 
babesiosis (Eisen et al. 2017b, Eisen and Eisen 2018). This finding

is consistent with previous studies showing very high levels of pro-
tection against I. scapularis nymphs from use of permethrin-treated 
military uniforms (Schreck et al. 1986, Evans et al. 1990) or perme-
thrin-treated summer-weight clothing (Miller et al. 2011).
Our side-by-side comparison of laboratory-reared and field-col-
lected I. scapularis nymphs was prompted by a previous study where 
field-collected nymphs used in bioassays several weeks after collec-
tion appeared to experience contact irritancy to a lesser extent than 
laboratory-reared nymphs (Eisen et al. 2017a). In this study, field 
nymphs examined on the day of collection exhibited similarly strong 
contact irritancy when introduced onto permethrin-treated textile 
as laboratory-reared nymphs (Table 1). One possible explanation to 
the contradictory results for field-collected I. scapularis nymphs in 
the same contact irritancy bioassay in the two studies may be that a 
tick’s ability to engage in behavior to escape contact with the irritant 
substrate is related to its physiological status. In the present study, 
the field nymphs were used in the bioassay on the same day they 
were collected and, as evidenced by their high level of activity even 
on the nontreated control textile (Table 1), represented vigorous 
specimens. In the previous study where field-collected nymphs failed 
to display contact irritant behavior when introduced onto perme-
thrin-treated textile (Eisen et al. 2017a), the nymphs were held in the 
laboratory for several weeks prior to being used and also showed a 
very low level of activity on nontreated control textile. We speculate 
that nymphal ticks in poor physiological condition may be overcome 
by the toxic effects of permethrin very quickly, thus rendering them 
unable to engage in evasive behavior that requires vigorous, coordi-
nated movement.
Across our bioassay experiments both laboratory-reared and 
field-collected I. scapularis nymphs consistently lost capacity for 
normal movement, and thus posed no more than minimal risk of 
biting by 1 h after forced contact with permethrin-treated clothing 
for 1 min (Tables 2, 4, and 6). As also reported in our previous study 
(Eisen et al. 2017a), some ticks recovered capacity for normal move-
ment by 24 h post-exposure as the effect of permethrin poisoning 
wore off. All examined types of permethrin-treated clothing were 
highly toxic to I. scapularis nymphs, regardless of whether the textile 
was 100% cotton, 100% synthetic material, or blends (Table 4). One 
intriguing finding is that although all three types of socks examined 
were highly toxic to the nymphs (0% ticks with normal movement 
1 h after forced 1-min exposure in all three cases), a much higher 
proportion of ticks remained after 5 min in the vertical contact irri-
tancy assay on one of the examined socks (94%) compared with the 
other two socks (22–26%). Rather than lack of contact irritancy, we 
speculate that this may have resulted from a looser weave and more 
‘fuzzy’ surface of the sock on which ticks were less likely to dislodge, 
perhaps leading them to more commonly get trapped in the fibers 
and fail to escape the irritant textile. A previous field trial showed 
that A. americanum nymphs can readily stay attached to vertically 
oriented socks while subjects are walking (Bissinger et al. 2011).

Perhaps not surprisingly, our side-by-side comparison of dif-
ferent tick species and life stages showed that as ticks increase in 
size—from I. scapularis nymphs to A. americanum nymphs and 
I. scapularis, A. americanum, and D. variabilis females—a longer 
period of contact with permethrin-treated textile was required to 
achieve loss of normal movement. Nevertheless, 5-min contact was 
sufficient for female ticks of all species to uniformly lose their abil-
ity to move normally by 1 h post-exposure. Much remains to be 
explored with regards to the impact of permethrin-treated textile 
on different tick species and life stages, both in terms of their innate 
susceptibility to permethrin and their posture, which may influ-
ence their level of contact with the treated textile. For example, it 
stands to reason that the ventral side of the body and capitulum of 
a smaller tick with shorter legs more frequently would make contact 
with the treated textile compared with a larger tick with longer legs. 
Moreover, the specific escape behavior when contacting a vertical 
treated textile, such as a sock or pant leg, also may be important: the 
typical response of I. scapularis nymphs is to actively flip over and 
tumble downward (Eisen 2017a) leading to both their ventral and 
dorsal surfaces coming into contact with the treated textile.
Our study had notable limitations, most importantly that we 
only examined pristine permethrin-treated clothing and therefore 
have no data for how wearing and washing the garments may affect 
their contact irritancy and toxicity toward ticks. With the exception 
of some of the I. scapularis nymphs, the ticks used in the bioassays 
were reared in the laboratory and it therefore would be beneficial 
to confirm the results with field-collected specimens from differ-
ent parts of the geographic ranges of medically important ticks. 
Moreover, assessing contact irritancy of permethrin-treated textiles 
for highly mobile female ticks will require modification of our exist-
ing bioassay as the females rapidly walked off small assay cards with 
nontreated control textile. Other limitations of the bioassays and 
tick vigor assessment were discussed previously (Eisen et al. 2017a).
Important remaining questions regarding the potential for per-
methrin-treated clothing to protect against bites by vector ticks and 
ultimately reduce tick-borne disease include the following: 1) poten-
tial loss of effectiveness following repeated wear and washing, as 
observed for mosquito vectors (DeRaedt Banks et al. 2015, Faulde 
et al. 2016, Orsborne et al. 2016, Kittayapong et al. 2017, Richards 
et al. 2017); 2) the level of acceptance for use of permethrin-treated 
clothing (Richards et al. 2014); and 3) the willingness of individu-
als to change their behavior by consistently putting on permethrin-
treated clothing when entering tick habitat (Vaughn et al. 2014), 
especially if this includes parts of your own backyard and requires 
daily action. We also need to better understand which portions of 
the body must be covered by permethrin-treated clothing to achieve 
strong protection against tick species with different host-seeking 
strategies. For example, treated shoes or socks alone may be rea-
sonably effective against mobile ‘hunter’ ticks capable of making 
contact with humans by actively seeking out their lower extremities 
when they stand still. However, more extensive coverage by perme-
thrin-treated garments may be required to protect against ticks that 
rather use an ambush strategy and essentially wait for hosts to con-
tact them, such as nymphs of I. scapularis and the closely related 
Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae). Humans 
greatly increase the risk for contact with nymphs of these species 
when picking up things from the ground (ticks getting onto hands 
and arms) or kneeling or sitting on the ground or natural features 
such as logs (ticks getting onto the legs) rather than simply walk-
ing through the environment (Carroll and Kramer 2001, Lane et al. 
2004). Consequently, adequate protection against bites by nymphal 
I. scapularis ticks may require wearing not only permethrin-treated 
shoes/socks but also permethrin-treated full-length pants and long-
sleeved shirts.
