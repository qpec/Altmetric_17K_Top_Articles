Objectives To determine the prevalence of knee pain, 
radiographic knee osteoarthritis (RKOA), total knee 
replacement (TKR) and associated risk factors in male 
ex-professional footballers compared with men in the 
general population (comparison group).
Methods 1207 male ex-footballers and 4085 men 
in the general population in the UK were assessed by 
postal questionnaire. Current knee pain was defined as 
pain in or around the knees on most days of the previous 
month. Presence and severity of RKOA were assessed 
on standardised radiographs using the Nottingham 
Line Drawing Atlas (NLDA) in a subsample of 470 ex-
footballers and 491 men in the comparison group. The 
adjusted risk ratio (aRR) and adjusted risk difference 
(aRD) with 95% CI in ex-footballers compared with the 
general population were calculated using the marginal 
model in Stata.
results Ex-footballers were more likely than the 
comparison group to have current knee pain (aRR 1.91, 
95% CI 1.77 to 2.06), RKOA (aRR 2.21, 95% CI 1.92 
to 2.54) and TKR (aRR 3.61, 95% CI 2.90 to 4.50). 
Ex-footballers were also more likely to present with 
chondrocalcinosis (aRR 3.41, 95% CI 2.44 to 4.77). 
Prevalence of knee pain and RKOA were higher in ex-
footballers at all ages. However, even after adjustment 
for significant knee injury and other risk factors, there 
was more than a doubling of risk of these outcomes in 
footballers.
Conclusions The prevalence of all knee osteoarthritis 
outcomes (knee pain, RKOA and TKR) were two to three 
times higher in male ex-footballers compared with 
men in the general population group. Knee injury is the 
main attributable risk factor. Even after adjustment for 
recognised risk factors, knee osteoarthritis appear to be 
an occupational hazard of professional football.
InTrOduCTIOn
Football is the world’s most popular team sport. 
Worldwide over 265 
million people are estimated to 
play football and of these 1 
10 
000 are professional 
male footballers.1 The average career of a profes-
sional footballer lasts 13.5 years and, despite typi-
cally being extremely fit, engaging in high-intensity 
match-play and training can result in sport-related 
health risks.2 Professional football has a high injury 
rate and 17% of all injuries involve the knee.3 
Apart from overt acute injury, the cumulative effect 
of repetitive microtrauma and joint overloading 
could also prove deleterious to the knee joint, as is 
recognised in other physically demanding occupa-
tions such as coal mining.4 
Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common complex 
disorder with multiple risk factors including 
injury.2 Although there have been long-standing 
concerns over the risk of KOA in ex-footballers, 
only six studies have examined this association.5–10 
However, these studies used different definitions of 
KOA and often focused on just one or two outcomes 
(eg, knee symptoms, structural KOA on imaging, 
self-reported diagnosis of KOA). Most studies 
were small, four had no comparison groups and 
adjustment for other known risk factors for KOA 
was absent or limited.2 Indeed, a recent systematic 
review cited the same limitations and concluded 
that only ‘very low quality’ evidence suggests foot-
ball increases the risk of KOA.11 No studies have 
used a general population group for comparison, 
so whether ex-footballers have more KOA than the 
general population remains unknown.
We hypothesise that, when recognised risk factors 
are adjusted for, several outcomes relevant to KOA, 
including knee pain, radiographic KOA (RKOA), 
radiographic chondrocalcinosis (CC) (this co-as-
sociates with KOA and has been associated with 
prior joint trauma12), physician-diagnosed KOA 
and knee arthroplasty (a surrogate for clinically 
severe KOA) are more prevalent in ex-footballers 
compared with the general population. Therefore, 
we undertook the following cross-sectional study 
comparing male ex-footballers with men in the 
general population.
The objectives of this study were:
1. To determine the prevalence of KOA outcomes 
(specifically knee pain, RKOA, CC, requirement 
for knee replacement surgery (TKR)) and risk 
factors for knee OA in a sample of retired 
male professional footballers in the UK and 
in a random sample of men in the general 
population.
2. To compare the prevalence of these outcomes in 
ex-footballers and the general population with 
adjustment for other known risk factors.
3. To determine the main attributable risks for any 
increased prevalence in knee OA outcomes in 
ex-footballers.

MeThOds
A cross-sectional design was used, involving postal questionnaire 
surveys to ex-footballers and to a sample of men in the general 
population to gain information on knee pain, knee surgery and 
KOA risk factors as well as simple demographics, occupational 
history, general health and current medications. Participants who 
indicated interest in attending for knee radiographs, irrespective 
of knee pain status and who provided written informed consent, 
were invited to undergo bilateral knee radiographs to determine 
RKOA and CC.
Participants
Ex-footballers were recruited via the Professional Footballers’ 
Association (PFA) and former players’ associations (n=21 
profes-
sional clubs). Inclusion criteria for ex-footballers were men 
aged over 40 years who had played professionally (in the top 
four tiers of the English Football League). The comparison 
group were recruited from the Knee Pain and Related Health 
in the Community Study (KPIC), involving recruitment via 12 
general practitioner/family medicine (GP) practices in the UK 
Midlands region. All men on these UK National Health Service 
GP registers aged 40 years and older who were not terminally 
ill, were able to give written informed consent and had no other 
reason judged by the GPs to exclude them from the study were 
sent the questionnaire.
Questionnaire survey
The postal questionnaire was developed based on previously 
published questionnaires.13 14 Through public and patient 
involvement, two pilot versions were evaluated to identify any 
problems with content, language and layout.
The 44 
775 questionnaires were similarly constructed to 
capture detailed information about the participant, their medical 
history and putative risk factors for KOA.5 A validated screening 
question was used to determine presence of current knee 
pain: "Have you ever had knee pain for most days of the past 
1 
month?”14 Additionally, a body pain mannequin15 was used to 
locate pain in other body regions. There were specific enqui-
ries about comorbidities, current medications and any past knee 
surgery including TKR. Constitutional knee alignment (in early 
20s), current knee alignment and the index-to-ring finger length 
ratio (2D:4D) were assessed using validated line drawings.16 17 
These drawings, which illustrated the direction and severity of 
each alignment grade, allowed participants to choose their knee 
alignments grades separately for early adult life and for current 
alignment. The grades being: A=severe 
varus, B=mild 
varus, 
C=straight legs, D=mild 
valgus and E=severe 
valgus. The 
2D:4D ratio can be visually classified as pattern 1 (index longer 
than ring finger), pattern 2 (index length equal to ring finger) or 
pattern 3 (index shorter than ring finger) and it is pattern 3 that 
has been associated with RKOA.17 Nodal OA was determined 
using a validated diagram18 and classified as present in those 
reporting nodes on at least two rays of both hands.19 Significant 
knee injury was defined as ‘one which caused pain for most days 
for at least a 3-month period and resulted in an absence from all 
training and matches during this time’. Occupations were classed 
as ‘high risk for KOA’ based on published evidence.20 Each listed 
occupation per individual was analysed and the data dichoto-
mised into high-risk or low-risk groups (excluding professional 
football careers).
radiographic knee osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis
All ex-footballers who returned a questionnaire indicating will-
ingness to have knee radiographs, and who lived within 40 
miles of a Spire Healthcare Hospital were invited to attend. 
Similarly, all general population men in KPIC who had indi-
cated interest were invited to attend the Nottingham University 
Hospitals Radiology Department for bilateral knee radiographs. 
Participants who had undergone bilateral TKR were excluded 
from radiographic assessment. All radiographs (weight-bearing 
semi-flexed posterior-anterior and 30° flexion skyline views) 
were performed using published protocols.16 21 Radiographs 
were scored by one observer (GSF), blinded to knee pain status, 
as a single mixed batch using HIPAX Dicom software. The 
Nottingham Line Drawing Atlas (NLDA) is a logically derived, 
interval (not ordinal)-based atlas and was used to score indi-
vidual compartment and composite joint space narrowing (JSN), 
individual compartment and subsequent composite osteophyte 
and combined (global JSN and osteophyte) scores for each 
knee.21 The NLDA uniquely provides separate illustrations for 
JSN for men and women to account for the normally wider joint 
space width in men and gives 0–5 interval scores for osteophyte 
at eight sites in the three compartments with consideration 
for natural variations in osteophyte shape. Separate line draw-
ings for joint space width and osteophyte removes the distrac-
tion of combined features and replaces the ordinal grading 
inherent in photographic atlases. The Kellgren and Lawrence 
(KL) composite grade (0–4) was also scored for the combined 
tibiofemoral compartments (medial and lateral) and separately 
for combined patellofemoral compartments (medial and lateral) 
using verbal descriptors for features of OA (JSN and/or osteo-
phyte presence) as opposed to a photographic atlas.
Definite dichotomised RKOA using the NLDA was defined 
as definite JSN (score >2) and definite osteophyte (score >2) 
in any compartment. CC in either hyaline or fibrocartilage was 
defined as present or absent. RKOA using KL was defined as 
grade >3 (definite osteophyte and definite narrowing) and addi-
tionally, grade >2 (definite osteophyte and possible narrowing) 
in any compartment. Intra-observer agreement (GSF) and 
interobserver agreement (GSF and AS) were assessed for NLDA 
and KL grades using kappa coefficients.
statistical analyses
Based on a 15% prevalence of RKOA in the general popula-
tion,22 the sample size needed was calculated using the z test 
and a logistic regression model with an a priori type power anal-
ysis. We assumed our data would include multiple confounding 
factors with a multiple correlation coefficient of 0.3 between 
them. With a power of 80% at 0.05, one tail (assuming footbal-
lers would have greater risk of knee OA than the general popula-
tion) and a relative risk (RR) of 2.0, the sample size required was 
424 participants per group. The power calculations were done 
using GPower, V
.3.1.9.2.
Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and 
percentages and continuous variables as means and SD. To deter-
mine whether distributions of the variables were statistically 
significantly different between ex-footballers and the general 
population, a t-test (continuous variables) or Χ2 test (categor-
ical variables) was used. Statistical significance was defined as 
p<0.05.
The RR, that is, the ratio of the prevalence of knee OA 
outcomes between the ex-footballers versus that in the general 
population was calculated. A multivariable logistic regression 
model was used to adjust for other confounding factors such as 
age, body mass index (BMI) and injury. This was followed by the 
adjrr Stata command.23 RR was determined instead of ORs as 
the outcomes of interest, such as KP and RKOA are not rare and

therefore the use of ORs would inflate the estimate. The primary 
purpose of this analysis was to confirm whether playing profes-
sional football is a risk factor independent from other potential 
knee OA risk factors. We therefore ran four analyses to follow 
this up. First, we calculated crude RR for playing professional 
football without any adjustment. Second, we estimated the RR 
adjusted for two common confounders for OA, age and BMI 
(model 1). Third, we brought injury into the model as it is a 
major risk factor of OA for anyone in the general population to 
examine whether footballing per se without a major injury is a 
risk factor for knee OA (model 2). Finally, we included all puta-
tive risk factors/confounders previously established in the liter-
ature and collected in the study (age, BMI, nodal OA, 2D:4D 
ratio, alignment, injury, high-risk occupation and comorbidi-
ties).24 We also calculated the risk difference (RD) as an absolute 
measure of association according to the STROBE.25 While the 
RR is the ratio of knee OA outcomes between the ex-footbal-
lers and controls, the RD is the difference between the preva-
lence of knee OA outcomes between these groups. The RD was 
calculated using a logistic regression model for each knee OA 
outcome (dichotomous) between the ex-footballers and general 
population followed by the same adjrr Stata command. The 
RR and RD in cross-sectional studies have also been termed as 
prevalence proportion ratio (PPR) and prevalence proportion 
difference (PPD), respectively to differ from those measured 
in cohort studies where the incidence rather than prevalence is 
used.26 However, despite the different terminologies, the calcu-
lations are identical, that is, RR or PPR=r1/r2, whereas RD or 
PPD=r1–r2, where r1 is the risk (prevalence in cross-sectional 
study or incidence in cohort study) in the exposure group (eg, 
ex-footballers) and r2 is the risk in the non-exposure group (eg, 
general population control). We therefore opted to use the RR 
and RD for this paper as they are more commonly used terms for 
relative risk and attributable risk and understood by the majority 
of clinicians. We had very few missing data at random (eg, where 
BMI was not reported by a participant). Imputation or modelling 
was therefore not undertaken for the occasional missing values.

resulTs
Of 4775 questionnaires sent to ex-footballers, 1207 responses 
(25%) were received. Of 40 
000 questionnaires sent to men and 
women in the community (KPIC), 9517 completed questionnaires 
(24%) were returned, including 4085 men (42.9%) (figure 1).
The mean age of ex-footballers was 59 years (±11.7), 3.9 years 
younger than the comparison group (62.9±10.4 years), but mean 
BMI were comparable (table 1). Ex-footballers had a higher prev-
alence of nodal OA, 2D:4D pattern 3 and body pain (all p<0.01) 
and were more likely to report constitutionally malaligned knees 
(varus or valgus) compared with men in the general population. 
Ex-footballers had fewer comorbidities such as diabetes and cancer 
(p<0.01) (table 1). Details on missing data for each variable have 
been provided in online supplementary appendix 1.
self-reported KOA outcomes
Overall prevalence of knee pain in ex-footballers was 52.2% 
compared with 26.9% in the general population (p<0.01). 
Across all age groups, ex-footballers had more current knee pain 
than the general population (figure 2A), especially in younger 
age groups (aged 45–54 years). There was no effect of later-
ality in knee pain prevalence in the right, left and both knees 
(see online supplementary appendix 2).
After adjusting for age and BMI, the aRR of current knee pain 
in ex-footballers was 1.91 (95% CI 1.77 to 2.06) compared 
with the general population. A higher proportion of ex-footbal-
lers (28.3%) than men in the general population (12.2%) had

received a diagnosis of KOA from a physician (aRR 3.73, 95% 
CI 3.33 to 4.17). Furthermore, 11.1% of ex-footballers reported 
TKRs compared with 3.8% of the general population (p<0.01), 
giving an aRR of 3.61 (95% CI 2.90 to 4.50). The prevalence of 
TKR by age categories is presented in figure 2B.
radiographic findings
Agreement between observers (AS and GSF) examining 21 
participants (40 knees) on two occasions using the NLDA was 
substantial (kappa 0.78), and intra-observer agreement kappas 
were 1.00 for each observer.
RKOA in any knee using NLDA scoring was present in 64% 
of footballers and 35.2% of the general population. Ex-footbal-
lers had significantly more RKOA in their right, left and both 
knees (27.2%, 34.6% and 14.4%) compared with the general 
population (12.2, 10.1% and 5.6%) (see online supplementary 
appendix 3); 15.7% of ex-footballers had RKOA in their right 
knee compared with 4.6% in the general population. The preva-
lence of RKOA by ages is presented in figure 2C.
After adjusting for age and BMI, the aRR of RKOA increased 
from 1.82 to over two times more likely (RR 2.21, 95% 
CI 1.92 
to 2.54) than in the general population. The prevalence of RKOA 
using KL grading (>3) in any compartment of either knee, was 
also higher in ex-footballers with an aRR of 2.46 (95% CI 1.89 
to 3.22) (table 2).
Ex-footballers had more RKOA in their left compared with their 
right knee. They also showed most JSN in the patellofemoral (PF) 
compartment, whereas the general population had most JSN in the 
TF compartment (see online supplementary appendix 3). Ex-foot-
ballers also had more RKOA in their right and left TF compart-
ment (15.7% and 11.6%) compared with the general population 
(4.6% and 5%) (see online supplementary appendix 4).
Ex-footballers were more likely than the general population 
to have CC (24.3% vs 8.8%) with an aRR of 3.41 (95% CI 2.44 
to 4.77) (table 2), and particularly had more CC in the left knee 
(see online supplementary appendix 5).
Table 3 presents the crude and adjusted risk difference (RD) 
for each knee OA outcome in the ex-footballers compared with 
the controls. The absolute measure of association for knee pain 
suggests that even after adjustment for age and BMI (model 
1), 24.46% (21.30%–27.62%) more ex-footballers would 
present with knee pain compared with the general popula-
tion. Similarly, even after adjustment for age and BMI, 37.49%

Apart from being professional footballers, knee injury, BMI, 
other high-risk occupation, constitutional knee malalignment and 
2D:4D finger ratio were also significantly associated with knee 
pain, RKOA and TKR (see online supplementary appendix 6).
dIsCussIOn
This is the first study comparing the risk of KOA in ex-footbal-
lers and the general population. The main findings in footbal-
lers are: first, a near twofold increased risk of current knee pain 
(aRR 1.91, 95% 
CI 1.77 to 2.06), which was most marked in 
younger age groups; second, a twofold increased prevalence of 
RKOA (aRR 2.21, 95% 
CI 1.92 to 2.54) at all age groups and a 
threefold increased prevalence of radiographic CC (aRR 3.41, 
95% 
CI 2.44 to 4.77) and third, almost a three times higher 
requirement for TKR (aRR 3.61, 95% 
CI 2.90 to 4.50). The 
major attributable risk factors are knee injury (aRR 1.89 for knee 
pain, 1.44 for RKOA and 3.32 for TKR), BMI (aRR 1.49 for 
knee pain and 2.24 for TKR) and nodal OA (aRR 1.46 for knee 
pain and 1.93 for TKR). However, even after adjusting for injury 
and other risk factors there is still over a twofold increased risk 
of KOA outcomes which supports an important role for repeti-
tive microtrauma associated with playing football.
The knee pain prevalence in the general population group 
accords with previous general population surveys14 27 and that 
in ex-footballers also is similar to previous reports.2 Ex-footbal-
lers were three times more likely to report a physician-diagnosis 
of KOA with a prevalence (28.3%) in line with previous ques-
tionnaire surveys.5 6 In this study, ex-footballers had three times 
more RKOA and specifically, JSN, in their right TF articulation 
(15.7%) than the general population (4.6%), which is similar to 
one study,9 but lower than others.7,8 This discrepancy may arise 
from smaller population samples in previous studies, selection 
bias from recruiting from a single club and radiographic cut-offs 
using ‘possible’ JSN. When using this cut-off (KL >2), our results 
remained unchanged with a twofold increased risk of RKOA. 
Our preferred RKOA definition requiring definite osteophyte 
and definite narrowing (KL >3) accords with pathological defi-
nitions of KOA that require both focal loss of hyaline cartilage 
and bone hypertrophy.28 Furthermore, we used the interval scale 
NLDA to score narrowing and osteophyte separately, which has 
several advantages over more commonly used ordinal scale photo-
graphic atlases and the composite KL grading system, particularly 
accounting for wider joint space widths in men and assessing the 
entire joint (all three compartments) with a global score.21 In 
addition to this, the NLDA was constructed to score changes in 
the TF and PF compartments of the knee, whereas KL grading 
has only subsequently been adapted for use in the PF compart-
ment (using the same verbal descriptors as for the combined TF 
compartments) and was not specifically designed for this purpose 
originally. Nevertheless, despite these caveats we included the KL 
grading to permit comparison with other studies that used KL 
grading to assess radiographic OA severity. The prevalence of CC 
was significantly higher in ex-footballers (24.3%) compared with 
the general population (8.8%) and previous population estimates 
(7%–10%).29 Both KOA and prior joint insult are recognised risk 
factors for CC,11 so this increased prevalence is consistent with 
more biomechanical knee trauma in footballers. Furthermore, 
concurrence of CC with KOA may associate with greater clinical 
severity and worse outcomes.,12 Interestingly, while our general 
population had more right knee RKOA, ex-footballers had signifi-
cantly more left knee RKOA, despite the majority indicating right 
limb dominance. As most football injuries are non-body contact 
in nature,3 this finding might be attributed to playing technique 
where players cannot respond quickly enough to rapid, unpredict-
able movements and where rotational strain on the weight-bearing, 
non-dominant/kicking limb may cause damage.8 Additionally, in 
ex-footballers JSN particularly targeted the PF compartment 
which is an important component of the knee extensor mecha-
nism that could be stressed by kicking with a partially flexed knee, 
by constitutional malalignment (which was increased in footbal-
lers (table 1)) or by torsional movements that influence patellar 
tracking, all of which may initiate PF degeneration.30
Ex-footballers reported more knee pain at all ages, and this 
was particularly marked in younger age groups (figure 2A). 
Having adjusted for all significant risk factors, including injury, 
ex-footballers still showed increased risks of knee pain, RKOA 
and TKR suggesting lasting damage from repetitive microtrauma 
sustained over the course of their footballing career. This is the 
first nationwide study to examine structural and person-cen-
tred outcomes relating to KOA in ex-footballers. The reported 
degree of increased adjusted risk (at least doubled) is in the order 
required by many national bodies to recognise KOA as an indus-
trial disease for professional football. Importantly, the study also 
identifies risk factors for KOA in footballers and in particularly, 
key modifiable risk factors, such as knee injury, being overweight/
obese and undertaking high-risk occupations after retiring from 
football (see online supplementary appendix 6).
CAVeATs
There are several limitations to this study. First, the use of self-re-
ported questionnaires might involve recall bias and possible 
misclassification of self-reported outcomes.31 A structured clinical

Original article
enquiry and assessment of every participant would have been 
preferable but was impractical due to logistics (UK nationwide 
survey) and limited resources. Nevertheless, we used validated 
instruments designed for questionnaire use and involved ex-foot-
ballers, patients and general public volunteers to help optimise 
clarity and ease of use of the questionnaire. Second, the subop-
timal response rate to the questionnaire and subsequently the 
ex-footballers and general population subsamples indicating 
willingness to have knee X-rays, could have resulted in selection 
bias. Unfortunately, we could not compare simple demographics 
or health records of responders and non-responders in either 
group due to data protection of externally held databases and 
patient confidentiality in the general population group. However, 
although knee pain positive individuals might be more likely to 
respond, this bias should be present in both groups. Furthermore, 
this is a large cross-sectional study and given that the prevalence 
of knee pain, RKOA, CC and risk factors in the general popula-
tion generally aligned with results from other population-based 
studies, it seems unlikely that the estimates are unduly biased. 
Third, although we surveyed ex-footballers over a wide area of 
the UK, for logistical reasons the general population was recruited 
from just one region. Nevertheless, the East Midlands was a major 
coal-mining region, a male occupation with an established risk of 
RKOA.4 Thus, any regional bias in the general population would 
have been expected to inflate rather than lower the prevalence of 
KOA, making the demonstrated increased risk in ex-footballers 
even more confident. Fourth, although radiographs are widely 
used to assess structural KOA in population-based studies, they 
are insensitive to soft tissue and other changes indicative of early 
KOA that can be identified by alternative imaging techniques such 
as MRI.32 Therefore, we are likely to have underestimated the 
true prevalence of structural OA in both ex-footballers and the 
general population. However, use of MRIs in this study was not 
financially or logistically viable. Another caveat is that while the 
authors were able to include known risk factors of KOA such as 
age, BMI and injury, there are still unmeasured confounders such 
as physical activity or unknown confounders that might contribute 
to the increased KOA outcomes in ex-footballers compared with 
the general population.
In summary, the prevalence of knee pain and RKOA in ex-foot-
ballers is twice as high as in men in the general population and 
ex-professional players develop knee pain earlier and require three 
times more knee joint replacements. This study took into account 
other risk factors for knee OA and demonstrates that professional 
football is a significant risk factor for the development of the symp-
toms (knee pain), structural change (RKOA, CC) and requirement 
for TKR. Knee injury is a major attributable risk factor for each of 
these outcomes. These findings have important consequences for 
football associations/unions and stakeholders for whom the health 
of retired and current professional footballers is paramount.

What are the findings?
 
► This is the first large-scale cross-sectional study to compare 
outcomes of knee pain, radiographic osteoarthritis and 
requirement for knee arthroplasty in ex-footballers to men in 
the general population. The prevalence of all knee outcomes 
was almost two to three times higher in ex-footballers even 
after adjustment for known risk factors including significant 
knee injury.
 
► The prevalence of knee pain by age reached its peak 10–15 
years earlier in ex-footballers compared with men in the 
general population.
 
► Knee injury, a high body mass index and a high-risk 
occupation (postretirement from football) are the main 
attributable risk factors for the increases in knee pain, 
radiographic osteoarthritis and knee replacement in 
ex-professional footballers.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
The results indicate modifiable risk factors such as obesity and 
significant knee injuries which can be better managed through 
self-education, early treatment, appropriate rehabilitation 
before return to play, etc in order to reduce knee osteoarthritis 
outcomes. This is an important finding for football associations/
unions and stakeholders for whom the health of retired and 
current professional footballers is a priority.
