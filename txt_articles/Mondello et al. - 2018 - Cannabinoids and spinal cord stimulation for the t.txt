Objective: This study aimed to evaluate pain and its symptoms in patients with failed back 
surgery syndrome (FBSS) refractory to other therapies, treated with a combination of delta-
9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), in association with spinal cord stimula-
tion (SCS).
Settings: Outpatients referred at Pain Unit of San Vincenzo Hospital in Taormina (Italy), 
between September 2014 and January 2016.
Subjects: Eleven FBSS patients diagnosed with neuropathic pain using the Douleur 
 
Neuropathique 4 questionnaire and suffering from moderate to severe chronic refractory 
pain, and undergoing treatment with SCS and a combination of THC/CBD for 12 consecu-
tive months.
Materials and methods: All the included patients discontinued previous unsuccessful therapy 
at least 2 months before the beginning of the cannabinoid therapy, with the exception of the SCS 
that was continued. Patients received a fixed dosage of cannabinoid agonists (THC/CBD) that 
could be increased subjective to pain control response. A Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire 
was administered to measure pain and its interference with characteristic dimensions of feelings 
and functions. The duration of treatment with SCS and THC/CBD combination was 12 months.
Results: Effective pain management as compared to baseline result was achieved in all the 
cases studied. The positive effect of cannabinoid agonists on refractory pain was maintained 
during the entire duration of treatment with minimal dosage titration. Pain perception, evaluated 
through numeric rating scale, decreased from a baseline mean value of 8.18±1.07–4.72±0.9 by 
the end of the study duration (12 months) (P<0.001).
Conclusion: The results indicate that cannabinoid agonists (THC/CBD) can have remarkable 
analgesic capabilities, as adjuvant of SCS, for the treatment of chronic refractory pain of FBSS 
patients.

Introduction
Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is defined by the International Association for 
the Study of Pain as “a spinal pain of unknown origin either persisting despite surgical 
intervention or appearing after surgical intervention for spinal pain originally in the 
same topographical location”.1 Several conditions have been identified as underlying 
causes for FBSS, such as epidural fibrosis, global or lateral canal stenosis, foraminal 
stenosis, retained disc fragment, recurrent disc herniation or degeneration, spinal 
instability, facet joint pain, sacroiliac joint pain, discitis, adhesive arachnoiditis, and

others.2 The percentage of the insurgency of chronic pain 
after spinal surgery varies significantly ranging from 5% to 
74.6%, and the percentage of the need for re-operation is 
between 13.4% and 35%.3 Up to 20%–40% of patients who 
have undergone lumbar spine surgery experience FBSS.4 
Nowadays, this syndrome affects ~0.02%–2% of the general 
population.5 The FBSS patients frequently suffer from mod-
erate to severe chronic pain, associated with sensory and/or 
motor deficits, as well as other severe chronic pain syndromes 
associated with the persistence of low back pain, deteriora-
tion or recurrence of radiculopathy, and sphincter dysfunc-
tion.6,7 The current therapeutic strategies for FBSS include 
antidepressant medications, antiepileptic medications,8 deep 
brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation (SCS),9,10 epidural 
and intrathecal injections,11,12 spine surgery,13 counseling,14 
and exercise therapy.15 FBSS is considered an intractable 
syndrome when various combinations of the existing thera-
peutic strategies prove ineffective. Opioids and their major 
adjuvants usually produce positive results in the treatment of 
chronic pain, especially when other therapeutic approaches 
fail. There is an increasing demand for alternative therapeutic 
strategies by patients and clinicians when available therapies 
are marginally effective, or not well tolerated. In this con-
text, the authors assessed the effectiveness of an alternative 
approach for chronic refractory pain associated with FBSS, 
using cannabinoids as a multimodal treatment approach to 
neuropathic pain. The plant Cannabis sativa L. has been used 
for centuries, both for recreational and medicinal purposes. 
Only in recent times, studies about exogenous cannabinoids 
have been performed to evaluate their therapeutic value 
and to investigate the role of endogenous cannabinoids 
(endocannabinoids) in physiology and pathophysiology of 
many neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases.16–18 Several 
types of insults which can damage the peripheral or central 
somatosensory nervous system, including FBSS, can cause 
neuropathic pain. It is estimated that 7%–8% of the popula-
tion in developed nations is suffering from neuropathic pain.19 
To date, therapeutic options for neuropathic pain induced by 
FBSS achieve effective analgesia in only less than 50% of 
the cases.20 This pain could, however, be effectively treated 
by drugs modulating endocannabinoid system.21 This system 
is highly expressed in neurons and immune cells, and it plays 
a crucial role in the development of neuropathic pain.22 This 
pilot study aimed to evaluate the effect of a combination of 
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/cannabidiol (CBD) in 
FBSS refractory to other available therapeutic strategies, 
including opioids, adjuvant drugs, radio frequency neuro-
modulating treatments, and SCS alone. The SCS, a treatment 
modality for chronic pain that has been in use since 1967,9 is 
an expensive therapy and careful selection for its suitability 
is recommended. Remarkable technological advances over 
the years have resulted in electrodes transitioning from 
single to multi-contact arrays and stimulators from external 
radiofrequency coupled to implantable rechargeable devices. 
Current implantable SCS electrodes can be inserted per-
cutaneously through a Tuohy needle using essentially the 
same technique as that used for an epidural catheter.23 In 
this context, a retrospective study documenting the results 
obtained with oral administration of cannabinoids agonists, 
namely a combination of THC/CBD, in eleven refractory 
FBSS patients is presented.
Materials and methods
This article reports a retrospective study, performed at Pain 
Therapy Unit of San Vincenzo Hospital of Taormina, in col-
laboration with the Anesthesiology and Pain Therapy Unit 
and the Department of Biomedical and Dental Sciences and 
Morphofunctional Imaging of the University Hospital “G. 
Martino” of Messina. All outpatients included in the study 
were referred at the Pain Unit of San Vincenzo Hospital, dur-
ing the period between September 2014 and January 2016. 
Treatments were performed in accordance with rules and 
ethical standards on human experimentation and the Decla-
ration of Helsinki of 1964 (further revised in 2013). All the 
study participants gave written informed consent (including 
information on possible risks and side effects) for participa-
tion in the research study. Every precaution was taken to 
protect the privacy of patients. The retrospective study was 
approved by the Local Ethics Committee (Comitato Etico 
Interaziendale della Provincia di Messina) with protocol 
number 61/17, and the clinical study is registered with the 
number NCT03210766 (www.clinicaltrials.org). Between 
November 2014 and December 2015, authors included the 
clinical records of eleven FBSS patients suffering from 
moderate to severe chronic pain not responsive to other treat-
ment regimens (including neuromodulating techniques), and 
considered eligible according to the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria established for the study. The patients, aged between 
49 and 77 years (median age 61.18±10.26 years), were 
equally distributed (six males and five females) (Table 1). 
Primary inclusion criteria in this study were the diagnosis of 
FBSS refractory to other standard treatments. Patients who 
had not discontinued their previous oral analgesic therapy, 
at least 2 months before the beginning of the treatment with 
cannabinoid agonists, were excluded. The SCS therapy, 
unsatisfactory in terms of pain perception as observed from

baseline numeric rating scale (NRS) values, was not discon-
tinued (Table 1). Cannabinoid agonists (THC/CBD) were 
administered in association with SCS for a treatment period 
of 12 consecutive months.
The neuropathic pain was assessed using the Douleur 
Neuropathique 4 (DN4) questionnaire in all the cases studied. 
The DN4 questionnaire consists of a total of ten items, of 
which seven items are related to the characteristics of pain 
(burning, painful cold, electric shocks) and its association 
with abnormal sensations (tingling, pins and needles, numb-
ness, itching), and three items are related to neurological 
examination in the painful area (touch hyperesthesia, pinprick 
hyperesthesia, tactile allodynia). The value of 1 was given to 
each positive item, and 0 value to each negative item. The 
total score was calculated as the sum of all ten items and 
the cutoff value for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain was 
established as a total score of 4/10.24 Basal DN4 scores of 
patients ranged from 7/10 to 10/10 (mean =8.9±1.37). The 
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) allows patients to rate and refer the 
severity of their pain and the degree by which pain interferes 
with common dimensions of feelings and functions. The BPI 
was performed by all the patients both at the first visit and at 
the end of treatment (after 12 months). Initially developed 
to assess pain related to cancer, the BPI has shown to be 
an appropriate measure of pain caused by a wide range of 
clinical conditions. The BPI is a eleven-item questionnaire 
that consists of four 0–10 NRS items asking patients to rate 
their pain at its “worst in the last 24 hours”, “least in the 
last 24 hours”, “average”, and “actually”, with 0 indicating 
“no pain” and 10 representing “pain as bad as you could 
imagine”. The remaining seven BPI items probe the degree 
to which pain interferes with general activity, mood, walking 
ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and 
enjoyment of life, again using a 0–10 value scale. For these 
interference items, 0 (zero) represents “does not interfere” 
and 10 indicates “interferes completely”.25 Baseline NRS

scores for average pain at visit ranged from 7 to 10 (mean 
=8.15±0.98) (Table 1). Patients were visited weekly in the 
first month and every 2 weeks for the entire study duration. 
All patients received an oleic suspension of THC (19%) and 
CBD (<1%), 25 mg/day for oral administration. The dosage 
of cannabinoid agonists could be increased, depending on 
the positive response to pain control.
Statistical analysis
The numerical data were expressed as the mean ± standard 
deviation (SD). For each numerical parameter for basal 
observation and after treatment, we separately performed 
statistical comparison using the Mann–Whitney test. For 
each numerical parameter, considered separately for basal 
and final values, we performed a comparison between basal 
observation and after treatment to evaluate the existence of 
a statistically significant difference using the Wilcoxon test.
Results
In FBSS patients treated with the THC/CBD combination, 
an analgesic effect was achieved in four cases within the 
first month of treatment. The effect of cannabinoid ago-
nists on refractory pain was maintained during the entire 
observation time with minimal dosage titration. The mean 
pain perception calculated using the NRS decreased from 
8.18±1.07 at first visit to 4.72±0.9 at the end of the obser-
vational time in all cases (Table 2), thus indicating marked 
analgesia with the treatment. The THC/CBD combination 
significantly reduced burning sensation and paresthesia 
linked to FBSS. The BPI interference examination showed 
that all the patients reported improvement in the quality of 
sleep (11/11; P<0.01). Additionally, THC/CBD combination 
enhanced mood as indicated by the rise in baseline mean 
level of 5.54±0.52–3.63±0.5 by the end of the study period

(P<0.001). Remarkably, similar results were obtained with 
every item on the questionnaire.
The maximum THC/CBD combination dose prescribed 
for all patients was 100 mg/day, while the minimum was 50 
mg/day, with a mean dose of 68.5 mg/day. All adverse events 
were transient lasting from 30 minutes to a few hours, and 
not requiring medical care or suspension of therapy (Table 3). 
There were no reports of any severe adverse events. 
Discussion
FBSS is a symptomatological syndrome, influenced by physi-
cal, psychological, and psychosocial factors that contribute 
to worsening individual quality of life. The pathological 
mechanism of intractable pain related to FBSS is complex 
and includes permanent inflammatory, neuropathic, and 
compressive processes, and in some cases are not suscep-
tible to medical or surgical resolution.26 Treatment for this 
category of patients aims to achieve relief from pain and 
consequently improve quality of life and daily activities. 
The diagnosis of FBSS through clinical history or history 
of spine operation is not always easy. Physicians should 
find the underlying causes of the pain and the mechanisms 
responsible for its maintenance and enforcement. Only an 
accurate diagnosis can potentially lead to the implementation 
of appropriate pain management strategies; this is particu-
larly true for neuropathic pain (of radicular, ganglion, or 
spine origin) which is initiated by nervous system lesions 
or dysfunction and can be maintained by several different 
mechanisms. Moreover, neuropathic pain is more likely to 
be caused either by surgical treatment or associated diseases 
(comorbidity) and is more difficult to treat than nociceptive 
pain.4 Successful treatment outcomes are difficult to achieve 
for chronic pain which can, in the long run, adversely affect 
the patient, health care services, and eventually the society. 
Although SCS can successfully induce analgesia initially, 
this has been observed to be relatively temporary, with the 
analgesia usually wearing out after 12–24 months,9 as in 
the presented study. In this scenario, the quick onset and 
prolonged analgesic effects obtained with cannabis-derived 
products seem to be independent of the effect of prior SCS 
therapy. From the results obtained, the superior analgesia 
combined with the low incidence of adverse events suggests 
that cannabis-derived products may be a valuable therapeutic 
option for chronic refractory pain associated with FBSS, in 
comparison to other drug classes including opioids. Canna-
bis-derived products have been used historically for chronic 
pain, and are attracting renewed pharmaceutical interest for 
analgesia. Epidemiological studies show that 10%–15% of 
patients suffering from chronic pain use cannabis to improve 
pain, sleep, and mood.18 Cannabinoid compounds mediate 
their pharmacological actions by binding to the cannabinoid 
receptors, namely cannabinoid type 1 receptor CB1 and can-
nabinoid type 2 receptor CB2. The CB1 receptors are located 
predominantly in the nervous system, while CB2 receptors 
are present in the immune cells.17 Moreover, several authors 
have described cannabinoid neurophysiological system as 
distinct but functionally similar to the opioid pain modulation 
system.27 Recent clinical trials, investigating the effects of 
the newest formulations of synthetic and naturally derived 
cannabinoids, demonstrated their analgesic properties for 
refractory neurogenic pain, brachial plexus injuries, and 
chronic neuropathic pain.16 These studies suggest that the 
administration of cannabinoid agonists should be considered 
in patients suffering from chronic moderate to severe pain, 
especially when other less invasive treatments and opioid 
therapies fail, or when extreme adverse events are reported.28 
The plant genus Cannabis contains a complex mixture of phy-
tochemicals (over 60 compounds) known as cannabinoids. 
Among the cannabinoids, the most investigated are the two 
major active chemical constituents, namely THC and CBD. 
Cannabinoids are mixed polyketides derived biosynthetically 
from malonyl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA units prenylated with 
geranyl phosphate.29 THC is the main psychoactive type of 
cannabinoid, whereas CBD is the major component of canna-
bis with a distinct pharmacological and psychotropic profile 
to THC. CBD (C21H30O2) is a resorcinol-based compound 
devoid of the psychoactive effects of THC and, on the con-
trary, is believed to be able to attenuate the psychotomimetic 
effects induced by high dosages of THC. Selective CB2 ago-
nists may reduce central effects, but these are not clinically 
available. The mechanism of action of CBD is complex and

Cannabinoids and SCS for the treatment of FBSS refractory pain
not fully known since this molecule is a “multifaceted-target” 
drug interacting with several non-endocannabinoid systems 
such as receptors, ion channels, enzymes, and transport-
ers.30 CBD modulates the activity of many cellular effectors, 
including the receptors CB1 and CB2,31 GPR55,32 5HT1A,33 
μ- and δ-opioid,34 peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
gamma (PPARγ),35 the transient receptor potential subfamily 
V member 1 (TRPV1) cation channels,36 and fatty acid amide 
hydrolase (FAAH).37
In Italy and other European countries, only a single 
product consisting of a THC/CBD oromucosal spray has 
been authorized by the regulatory agency for the treatment of 
multiple sclerosis spasticity. However, other cannabis flower 
preparations may be prescribed for patients suffering from 
chronic pain conditions, refractory to conventional therapy. 
In the present study, orally administered oleic suspension of 
THC (19%) and CBD (<1%) was chosen chiefly because the 
pharmacokinetic data indicate that intake of “high content” 
of THC cannabis oil results in detectable plasma concentra-
tions of THC as compared to ingestion of “low content” 
of THC cannabis oil or “mid-content” THC oil-containing 
capsules.38 Additionally, the availability of the product and 
the simplicity offered by the oral route of administration for 
the oil suspension, in comparison to vaporization, were favor-
able factors in choosing this formulation. Due to the lack of 
precise information on efficacy and safety of the product, the 
study protocol involved an initial low dosage to be increased 
according to the patient response.
In the cases described in the present study, the analysis 
of results confirms the positive effects of treatment with 
THC/CBD in patients with refractory FBSS pain. More-
over, results from BPI examination show an improvement 
in mood and general activities as well (P<0.001). Overall, 
THC/CBD combination was well tolerated and not asso-
ciated with any severe side effects. However, the small 
number of cases and the lack of a control group are limit-
ing factors for this study to assess a definitive effect and/
or for the identification of patient population for which 
treatment with THC/CBD may be appropriate. The posi-
tive effect of THC on the quality of sleep, reported in our 
study, has already been observed by other authors,39 and 
could perhaps positively influence pain perception. To 
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study report-
ing the beneficial effects of a combination of THC/CBD 
in FBSS refractory pain. Preliminary studies on cannabis 
and sleep suggest that CBD may have therapeutic effects 
on insomnia. Similar effects favoring sleep were observed 
with THC; however, contradictory findings revealed that 
this compound decreases sleep latency and could impair 
sleep quality in the long term.40 As a consequence, in our 
opinion, the effects of THC on pain may be independent 
of an effect on sleep. Finally, cannabis-derived products 
should be used cautiously in patients with a history of, or 
current anxiety or panic disorder, as well as for those with 
potential for reported dependence or abuse. Additionally, 
careful monitoring is advised for patients with depression 
and other psychiatric disorders.41
Conclusion
This is the first study that underlines the beneficial effects of 
cannabinoids for the treatment of FBSS. The results suggest 
that THC/CBD combination may represent an innovative 
and valid strategy to treat disabling symptoms represented 
by pain, nausea, and sleep disorders in FBSS patients. Fur-
thermore, in these patients, cannabinoid treatment could 
positively contribute to an improved quality of life. Though 
cannabinoids can have common side effects such as dry 
mouth and drowsiness, the side effects profile of THC/CBD 
combination seems to be milder and well tolerated. The chief 
limiting factors of this study are the small number of cases of 
FBSS patients with intractable refractory pain and the lack 
of a control group, even though it is a general opinion that 
interpretation of results obtained with placebo-controlled 
trials may encounter difficulties because of the psychoactive 
effects of cannabis. Additionally, it must be noted that ethical 
rules in Italy are very restrictive, especially in the context 
of pain treatment.
Albeit the limitations, in all the cases reported, the 
beneficial effect obtained with cannabinoids in association 
with SCS demonstrate that SCS therapy alone may be not 
sufficient to provide adequate analgesia.
Finally, we believe that prospective clinical studies are 
required to assess the real safety and efficacy of THC/CBD 
combination for chronic FBSS refractory pain. In conclu-
sion, the current study suggest that THC/CBD combination 
represents an alternative treatment strategy in FBSS patients 
with chronic and severe pain, refractory to neuromodulating 
techniques, and is a valuable adjuvant to SCS.
