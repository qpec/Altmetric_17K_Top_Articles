Abstract
Interventions that target fundamental aging processes have the potential to transform human health and health care. A variety of candidate drugs 
have emerged from basic and translational research that may target aging processes. Some of these drugs are already in clinical use for other 
purposes, such as metformin and rapamycin. However, designing clinical trials to test interventions that target the aging process poses a unique 
set of challenges. This paper summarizes the outcomes of an international meeting co-ordinated by the NIH-funded Geroscience Network to 
further the goal of developing a translational pipeline to move candidate compounds through clinical trials and ultimately into use. We review 
the evidence that some drugs already in clinical use may target fundamental aging processes. We discuss the design principles of clinical trials to 
test such interventions in humans, including study populations, interventions, and outcomes. As examples, we offer several scenarios for potential 
clinical trials centered on the concepts of health span (delayed multimorbidity and functional decline) and resilience (response to or recovery from 
an acute health stress). Finally, we describe how this discussion helped inform the design of the proposed Targeting Aging with Metformin study.
Keywords: Aging—Clinical trials—Metformin—Rapamycin—Acarbose
This paper is an outcome of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-
funded Geroscience Network, a consortium of 18 aging centers and 
academic groups across the United States, in partnership with groups in 
the European Union (Supplementary Table 1). Here, we summarize and 
expand upon discussions held during a R24 Geroscience retreat that fol-
lowed a Zing Conference on the Biology of Human Aging in September, 
2014 in Oropesa, Spain. This retreat brought together geriatric leaders 
who have carried out intervention studies in the elderly people, and ger-
ontologists and basic scientists who are working on strategies to extend 
health span and life span in model systems (Supplementary Material). 
At the preceding conference, each of the retreat participants gave a 
focused lecture on their experience related to the mission of the retreat, 
“To design studies to delay age-related dysfunction and diseases using 
drugs approved for human use.” The retreat participants brainstormed 
and prioritized ideas as a group. This retreat approached clinical trials 
broadly; a later retreat further developed ideas specifically around early-
stage proof-of-concept clinical trials, which is presented separately in 
Justice et al. in this issue. Here, we summarize the ideas developed in 
Oropesa on the conduct of clinical trials of aging interventions, includ-
ing support for further prioritization, and discuss an outline of strate-
gies for translating biological findings into treatments to delay, prevent, 
alleviate, or treat age-related dysfunction and diseases.
Goals of Clinical 
Trials 
That 
Target Aging Processes
The promise of interventions that target the aging process is that 
they might have an outsized impact on major outcomes that matter 
deeply to patients—ability to maintain independence and quality of 
life—through broad effects on many different age-related diseases,

 syndromes, and age-related declines in physiological function. Age is 
not only the leading risk factor for many common chronic diseases 
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and Alzheimer’s dis-
ease but is also the major risk factor for geriatric syndromes such as 
falls, immobility, frailty, and incontinence (1). Loss of independence 
due to geriatric syndromes may not be due to a single disease process 
but to the accumulation of physiological dysfunctions in multiple 
systems from many underlying processes. However, they may ulti-
mately have their genesis in a more limited number of fundamental 
aging mechanisms that predispose to multiple chronic diseases and 
affect the physiological function of many organ systems. The goal of 
interventions targeting aging processes is not to prolong life span per 
se, although this may be a desirable side effect, but rather to extend 
health span. We define health span as the number of years of life 
that is relatively free from disease and morbidity, during which the 
daily activities and independence of the individual are maintained. 
Data from preclinical animal studies and the limited human studies 
of the interventions described in the section titled Candidate Drugs 
That Affect the Aging Process indicate that they may be effective for 
slowing age-related decline in a variety of settings.
Determining the effect of such interventions on delaying or allevi-
ating aging processes in humans will ultimately require one or more 
randomized, controlled clinical trials conducted over a sufficient 
time period in a large, heterogeneous older adult population test-
ing “hard” outcomes such as burden of chronic diseases, functional 
dependence, and/or mortality. As we describe in this paper, trials of 
this sort would be a major effort. However, such a successful trial 
would be groundbreaking, with enormous implications not only for 
medical practice and policy but for society in general (2). The first 
step on a path to large clinical trials is a series of smaller clinical tri-
als that can provide evidence for the concept that aging processes can 
be affected in humans, provide biological data for reverse translation 
studies of the effects of interventions targeting basic aging mecha-
nisms in humans, suggest or validate intermediate outcomes such as 
biomarkers or surrogate clinical endpoints, and inform the design 
and scale of larger trials. Challenges encountered in randomized 
clinical trials are well described and include protocol adherence by 
study participants or study sites; dropouts leading to missing data 
(3); result interpretation of the “intention to treat” analysis, where 
everyone in the treatment group is analyzed together regardless of 
their adherence to the study intervention (4); participant diversity 
(gender, ethnicity, geography, and age) (5); and generalizability. In 
the following sections, we will describe candidate drugs that affect 
the aging process, offer demonstrative examples of potential studies, 
and discuss issues and challenges in the design of such studies that 
test interventions targeting fundamental aging mechanisms.
Candidate Drugs 
That Affect the Aging Process
In the decades that have passed since the first single genes were 
identified that regulate longevity in an organism (6,7), a variety of 
pathways have been discovered that, if manipulated, are associated 
with life-span and health-span extension. Alongside pathway dis-
covery has come the identification of a number of candidate drugs 
that inhibit or activate proteins within these pathways to regulate 
their function. Some of this has been through traditional transla-
tion of basic science findings, but much discovery to date has been 
“reverse translation”: mapping existing drugs with relevance to 
aging processes onto specific mechanisms and pathways. Metformin 
is one prominent example, in use for decades without a clear under-
standing of its mechanism of action, but now thought to exert its 
broad effects on health span and aging at least in part as a calorie 
restriction mimetic through inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1 
and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (8).
A growing number of drugs have been rigorously demonstrated to 
extend life span in laboratory rodents though multicenter testing with 
genetically heterogeneous mice in the National Institute on Aging (NIA) 
Interventions Testing Program (ITP), including rapamycin (9,10), acar-
bose (11), aspirin (12), 17-α-estradiol (11), and nordihydroguaiaretic 
acid (11,12). Other drugs that have been shown to extend life span in 
non-ITP studies include metformin (13), two sirtuin activators (14,15), 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (16,17), and aldosterone recep-
tor blockers (ARBs) (18). In some cases, these studies examined health-
span outcomes as well, such as cognitive function, metabolic health, 
and motor performance. Other compounds, such as resveratrol, did not 
extend life span in nonobese rodents but appear nonetheless to have 
pleotropic effects on age-related diseases and physiological function.
Many novel agents are under development to target the cellu-
lar processes that are now understood to affect fundamental aging 
(19,20). These include new molecules related to rapamycin that 
may have better side effect profiles, including less gastrointestinal 
(GI) irritation and less glucose intolerance (21,22). Growth and dif-
ferentiation factor-11–related agents (23,24), drugs that selectively 
clear senescent cells—senolytic agents (25–27), drugs that protect 
against the proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phe-
notype (28,29), drugs that are related to mitochondrial function 
(30), agents that impact protein synthesis or autophagy (31,32), and 
caloric restriction mimetics (33) are among the types of compounds 
that are currently being developed or tested. A robust and standard-
ized preclinical pipeline, discussed in Huffman et al. in this issue, will 
be essential for developing novel interventions that might target new 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications related to aging, 
frailty, functional decline, or multimorbidity. Preclinical studies will 
be critical for testing various concepts of outcomes, establishing dos-
ing and biomarkers within broad ranges, and studying initial safety.
A variety of other nondrug interventions have been shown to 
either delay age-related changes or extend life span in rodent mod-
els. Together with the hundreds of single-gene mutations that extend 
life span (34), these include (nonexhaustively) calorie, protein, and 
methionine restriction (35); visceral fat removal (36); elimination of 
senescent cells (27,37); exposure to young serum (38); and serum-
derived proteins such as GDF-11 (23,24,39); GH and insulin-like 
growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor inhibitors (40); mitochondrial 
derived peptides (41); activators of AMPK (42); and many others. 
Some of these are currently the focus of drug-discovery efforts to 
recapitulate their beneficial effects.
In the sections that follow we will briefly review some of the 
more promising agents that have emerged from human and animal 
testing, emphasizing those already approved for use in humans (sum-
marized in Table 1).
Metformin
Metformin, an FDA-approved first-line drug for the treatment of type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has been used successfully in patients 
for more than 60 years with an outstanding safety record. Data 
on both clinical and model organisms suggest that metformin has 
broad effects on aging (see the recent review (43) and Supplemental 
Material, for additional references). Metformin is associated with 
extended longevity in male C57BL/6 mice, and the ITP suggested 
a synergistic effect with rapamycin. Metformin also extends the 
life span of nematodes, suggesting that it targets an evolutionarily 
conserved mechanism. In T2DM, metformin decreases hepatic glu-
cose production by several mechanisms, leading to lower circulating

 glucose and insulin levels and improved insulin action. Metformin 
also decreases IGF-1 signaling, activates AMPK, and may inhibit 
the proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype. 
A recent study extends metformin actions to reduction of oxida-
tive stress and inflammation, together with prolongation of both life 
span and health span in C57BL/6 males.
In humans, metformin can prevent the progression from 
impaired glucose tolerance to overt diabetes in overweight patients 
(44). But if indeed metformin targets human aging processes, its 
administration should be associated with less age-related disease 
in general, rather than simply the decreased incidence of a single 
age-related disease such as T2DM. Notably, in the United Kingdom 
Prospective Diabetes Study metformin, compared with other anti-
diabetes drugs, also demonstrated a decreased risk of CVD—an 
effect also suggested by meta-analysis of other studies. In addition, 
numerous epidemiologic studies have shown an association between 
metformin use and decreased risk of cancer, as well as decreased 
cancer mortality. There is also evidence from studies performed 
both in vitro and in vivo of metformin’s role in attenuating tumori-
genesis. In fact, metformin’s potential protective effect against can-
cer has been gaining much attention, with more than 100 ongoing 
studies registered on the clinicaltrials.gov website. Data on effects 
of metformin on Alzheimer’s disease are still emerging but contro-
versial. In addition, a recent observational study demonstrated that 
metformin treatment among older diabetics was associated with 
improved overall survival that surpassed the survival of matched 
controls without diabetes. This evidence from human studies, com-
bined with other clinical and basic science investigations, makes 
metformin a prime candidate for a clinical trial that aims to target 
aging processes.
Acarbose
Acarbose (ACA) has been approved and used around the world for 
the treatment of T2DM for more than 15 years. It has an outstand-
ing safety record, although it commonly leads to minor GI side 
effects. ACA slows processing of starch into disaccharides by inhibit-
ing α-glucosidases in the intestine, thereby reducing peaks in glucose 
absorption (45). ACA was tested in the ITP based on the hypothesis 
that spikes in post meal glucose could contribute to biological aging 
(46). ACA administration increased male mouse median life span 
by 22%, but increased female median life span by only 5% in the 
ITP (11). This sexual dimorphism could not be explained by effects 
of ACA on weight. ACA increased maximum life span by ~10% in 
both genders. ACA administration resulted in increased food intake, 
but decreased body weight and glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 levels 
(11,47). In humans, the Stop-NIDDM trial (48) showed that ACA 
can prevent progression of impaired glucose tolerance to T2DM. 
ACA was also associated with a statistically significant 49% relative 
risk reduction in the development of CVD events, including myocar-
dial infarction (49). ACA administration was associated with a 34% 
relative risk reduction in the incidence of new cases of hypertension 
and risk of “silent” myocardial infarction (50). It is important to note 
that glucose-lowering efforts using numerous drug interventions to 
try to prevent cardiovascular effects in T2DM have not been suc-
cessful. This raises the possibility that ACA targets aging processes 
through other mechanisms, perhaps through effects on the intestinal 
microbiome, causing intestinal cells to release other peptides such 
as GLP1, or, possibly, systemic absorption of ACA leading to direct 
effects of ACA on cellular processes.
ACEi and ARBs
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin 
II receptor antagonists (also known as angiotensin receptor block-
ers or ARBs) are widely used as antihypertensive agents and have 
a strong safety record. Interestingly, ACEi and (in some cases) 
ARBs have been shown to reduce mortality in heart failure and 
after myocardical infarction, and to be renoprotective in diabetes, 
all at least partially independent of the effect on blood pressure 
(51). Although ARBs were at first thought to increase cancer risk 
(52), later studies have found that they are actually associated 
with a lower risk of cancer (53) and reduced cancer mortality (54). 
Finally, treatment of hypertension with an ACEi or ARB may help 
prevent cognitive decline in people with hypertension or CVD (55–
57), although this may reflect a general effect of antihypertensive 
treatment, and the relationship between antihypertensive treatment 
and cognition remains controversial. Many of these human data 
were presaged by rodent studies. ACEi increased life span in both 
healthy (16,17) and hypertensive rodents (58,59). Both ACEi and 
ARB prolong rat life span and improve cardiovascular function 
(18), as well as protect against age-related declines in kidney and 
cognitive function (60). One nonantihypertensive mechanism for 
these benefits may be reduced oxidative stress in the mitochondria 
through inhibition of the angiotensin system (61). Finally, genetic 
disruption of the angiotensin II receptor prolongs mouse life span 
(62), and variations in its gene are associated with exceptional 
human longevity (63).

 Rapamycin and rapalogs
Rapamycin inhibits the eponymous mTOR kinase, which lies in two 
distinct protein complexes. mTORC1 in particular is an integrative 
center of cellular energy signaling, activated by glucose and amino 
acids, and strongly inhibited by rapamycin. Rapamycin is FDA 
approved as an immunosuppressant for solid organ transplantation, 
while derivative “rapalogs” are approved for treatment of certain 
cancers (64). Rapamycin extends life span in yeast, flies, and worms, 
as well as in C57BL/6, 129/Sv, and genetically heterogeneous mice, 
even when started late in life (see the recent reviews (65,66) for 
additional references) Rapamycin has a variety of effects in mice 
that might contribute to longevity, including modulating stem cell 
function and inflammation, promoting autophagy, slowing cognitive 
decline, and alleviating models of heart failure and neurodegenera-
tion. It is not a panacea in rodents, however, with side effects includ-
ing increased rates of kyphosis and cataracts. The clinical use of 
rapamycin in humans has permitted detailed examination of human 
adverse effects, including metabolic dysfunction, impaired wound 
healing, and aphthous ulcers. Despite these challenges, clinical trials 
are at various stages of development to test rapamycin or its ana-
logs as an adjuvant to cardiac rehabilitation after cardiac surgery 
or angioplasty (CARE study, NCT01649960), for cognitive impair-
ment in Alzheimer’s disease and for enhancing the immune response 
to vaccination in the elderly people (67).
17-α-Estradiol
17-α-Estradiol is a nonfeminizing endogenous estrogen that has 
lower affinity for estrogen receptors than 17-β-estradiol (68). It was 
demonstrated to have neuroprotective properties in animal models 
of Parkinson’s (69), Alzheimer’s (70), and cerebrovascular diseases 
(71). Its protection may be mediated, in part, via anti-oxidant effects. 
However, the anti-oxidant effects of 17-α-estradiol are likely not 
mediated through estrogen receptors (72). It has been shown to acti-
vate multiple signaling proteins within the mitogen-activated protein 
kinase pathway, including B-Raf and extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase (73). Like metformin, 17-α-estradiol increases AMPK activ-
ity and, like rapamycin, it reduces mTOR activity (74). In mice, 
17-α-estradiol alleviates age-related metabolic and adipose tissue 
dysfunction (74). Rodent studies using 17-α-estradiol conducted 
through the NIA ITP demonstrated a significant extension in median 
life span in males by 12%, but not in females (11), albeit with a wide 
variation among the three ITP testing sites. 17-α-estradiol appears 
to have a good safety profile in humans, although the data are lim-
ited. No adverse events were documented in a Phase 1 clinical study 
conducted with orally administered 17-α-estradiol at various doses 
in a group of postmenopausal females of an average age of 60 years 
(75). It has been approved for topical use in Europe for treatment 
of alopecia (76) as well as an element of postmenopausal estrogen 
replacement (77).
Sirtuin agonists
Sirtuins are a class of NAD-dependent deacetylases related to the 
budding yeast gene Sir2, one of the first longevity genes identi-
fied in this workhorse model organism (see the review (78) and 
Supplementary Materials for additional references). Genetically 
increasing the activity of Sir2 or its homolog increases life span in 
yeast and, controversially, in fruit flies and round worms. There 
are seven mammalian Sir2 homologs. Overexpression of SIRT6 
increases longevity in otherwise normal male mice and protects mice 
against the deleterious metabolic effects of high-fat feeding, possibly 
through repression of IGF signaling. The other mammalian sirtuins 
have not been shown to extend life span when overexpressed, but 
they do have beneficial functions in a variety of age-related physio-
logical parameters and diseases. SIRT1, when overexpressed in mice, 
reduces cancer incidence and osteoporosis, while improving glucose 
tolerance and wound healing. The regulation of sirtuins is complex, 
but it is hoped that sirtuin-activating compounds might recapitu-
late some of these health benefits. Resveratrol, a plant phenol that 
activates sirtuins among other biochemical functions, extends life 
span in yeast and flies. Two newer sirtuin activators, SRT2104 and 
SRT1720, both extend health span and life span in mice. Resveratrol 
itself does not affect life span in normally fed, nonobese mice, but it 
does, along with the other sirtuin activators, improve health and life 
span in mice made obese by high-fat feeding. Resveratrol appears 
to have similarly beneficial metabolic effects in rhesus monkeys fed 
a high calorie diet and possibly obese humans, although there are 
conflicting data about whether sirtuin activators alleviate glucose 
intolerance in humans. The diversity of effects of sirtuin activators 
on age-related diseases and evidence of life-span extension in certain 
model organism studies—especially when obese or under metabolic 
stress—suggest that these drugs might eventually turn out to hold 
promise for targeting age-related processes.
Aspirin and salicylic acid
Aspirin is the most widely used medication in the world, popular as 
an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent as well as an antiplatelet 
thrombosis inhibitor. It is an acetylating agent, with many of its clini-
cal effects thought to be due to irreversible acetylation of a serine 
residue in the active site of cyclooxygenase enzymes. Interestingly, 
aspirin appears to reduce cancer risk in humans (79–81). When tested 
in the ITP, aspirin was found to increase the median, but not maxi-
mum life span of genetically heterogeneous mice (12). Additional 
mechanisms of action may explain these diverse effects. Salicylic acid 
is a metabolite of both aspirin and the related anti-inflammatory 
drug salsalate and has been shown to be an allosteric activator of 
AMPK (82). In mice, salicylic acid improves lipid utilization via 
AMPK, but also improves glucose homeostasis through an independ-
ent and currently unknown mechanism (82). In a small clinical trial, 
salsalate improved glucose control in diabetics (83). Subsequently, 
aspirin was found to inhibit mTOR and activate AMPK in human 
colorectal cancer cells (84) and to extend life span in worms though 
activation of AMPK and Daf-16/FOXO3 (85). Together, these results 
from both human and model organism studies suggest that aspirin 
and related compounds may broadly regulate effects of aging and 
age-related diseases through several distinct mechanisms.
Designing Clinical 
Trials 
That 
Target Aging Processes
There are two broad strategies for an intermediate trial of an inter-
vention targeting fundamental aging processes, aimed at the related 
concepts of health span and resilience (Figure 1). Health span might 
be gradually limited by slow physiological decline, together with the 
accumulation of multiple chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes 
that all together result in morbidity and functional dependence 
(Figure 1A). Alternatively, health span may be truncated by an acute 
event that causes sudden, severe morbidity and functional depend-
ence with limited or no recovery (Figure 1B). The ability to rebound 
back to baseline functional and health status after an acute event is 
termed resilience. Older, frail individuals are less able to cope with 
major physiological stressors such as surgery or myocardial infarc-
tion. Acute illnesses have more severe presentations in the elderly 
people, recovery times are longer, risk of death is higher, and likeli-
hood of recovering to the prior level of function and independence

 is much lower than when the same stress occurs in a young person 
(86). This lack of resilience is a major cause of morbidity, functional 
dependence, and death.
Principles of Study Design for a Clinical 
Trial of 
Health Span
Scenario 1: Extension of health span
Example: A longitudinal double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 
older adults at high risk for age-related diseases testing the effect of 
metformin on prevention of age-related diseases or significant func-
tional limitation over a 5-year period.
Extension of human health span, the number of years of life that 
are spent free of functional limitations, morbidity, and chronic pain, 
is a key goal of new clinical interventions that target aging processes 
(Figure 1A). If aging is associated with a gradual accumulation of mul-
tiple chronic diseases (multimorbidity), geriatric syndromes, and func-
tional decline that leads to limited health span, then a study targeting 
the aging process would test if an intervention can slow or prevent these 
adverse health events over a relatively long period of time. Such a study 
should be longitudinal, double blinded, and placebo controlled, with 
careful attention to the adjudication of events. Longitudinal design is 
essential to evaluate the effect of an intervention on the incidence of new 
events or conditions. In a longitudinal study, participants are followed 
prospectively and information is collected about the occurrence of new 
clinical events of interest. Event information might be collected yearly, 
semiannually, or at other designated frequencies through structured 
interviews at follow-up study visits or through telephone interviews 
with the participants. Such a design is not without precedent; there is a 
wealth of data available from a variety of clinical trials on the effect of 
drugs and lifestyle interventions on multiple health outcomes. However, 
the idea of a clinical trial that targets the aging process as a means of 
delaying disease and disability is a relatively novel concept. Because the 
age-related health events of interest involve multiple systems, including 
the cardiovascular, renal, neurologic, musculoskeletal, and endocrine 
systems, the therapeutic intervention must exhibit multisystem effects in 
order to demonstrate its efficacy as a drug that targets aging processes. 
The selection of the study population would determine whether the 
intervention might be thought of as primary or secondary prevention. 
At one extreme, a study of healthy, community-dwelling older adults 
might require a large study population for adequate power and a fairly 
benign intervention given the low likelihood of a poor outcome. At the 
other extreme, a study of frail, already multimorbid or partially depend-
ent older adults might be more analogous to a secondary prevention 
trial where the likelihood of poor outcomes is greater. For a second-
ary prevention trial, a smaller study population can provide adequate 
power. Greater risk might be tolerated from the intervention in the hope 
of altering the poor natural course. The study proposed here should 
strike a balance, discussed in the sections that follow.
Principles of Study Design for a Clinical 
Trial of 
Resilience
Scenario 2: Resilience to acute stressors
Example A: Enhancing immunization: Enroll healthy, community-
dwelling patients referred for annual influenza vaccination. Provide 
study drug as a prehabilitation intervention. Primary outcomes 
are immune responses to vaccination and incidence of influenza. 
Secondary outcomes include measures of function, comorbidity, and 
biomarkers.
Example B: Preserving independence after elective surgery: Enroll 
functionally independent, community-dwelling patients scheduled to 
undergo major elective surgery. Provide study drug as a prehabilita-
tion intervention. Primary outcomes include length of stay, wound 
healing, delirium, and discharge disposition. Secondary outcomes 
include measures of function, comorbidity, and biomarkers.
Example C: Reducing readmission and functional decline after hos-
pitalization: Enroll elderly patients admitted with a diagnosis of 
sepsis who are at elevated risk for posthospital mortality and func-
tional decline. During recovery, provide study drug as an interven-
tion along with conventional rehabilitation as indicated. Primary 
outcomes include readmission, mortality, and functional recovery 
after rehabilitation. Secondary outcomes include measures of func-
tion, comorbidity, and biomarkers.
Trials of resilience would test whether an intervention can improve 
health and functional outcomes after an acute stress. As described 
earlier, a key principle is that the response to the stressor should 
change with age. As resilience is a concept that spans a broad range 
of clinical scenarios, trials targeting resilience could be heteroge-
neous across several design variables. These variables include the 
intensity of the stressor, planned versus unplanned stressors, and the 
timing of the intervention. Targeting relatively minor stressors like 
immunization (Example A) might be analogous to a primary pre-
vention trial as described earlier. Targeting a major planned stressor 
such as elective surgery or chemotherapy (Example B), or providing 
an intervention as rehabilitation after a major stressor (Example C, 
rehabilitation after sepsis), might be more analogous to a secondary 
prevention trial with a much higher likelihood of poor outcomes 
without intervention. In all examples, the primary outcome would 
be related to the specific stressor, such as immune response to vac-
cination (67), or functional recovery after hip arthroplasty.
Considerations for 
Trials 
That 
Target Either Health 
Span or Resilience
As outlined in this paper, many unique challenges accompany the 
design of clinical trials that target aging processes, some of which 
will be addressed in the following sections in the context of the two 
described scenarios.
Figure 1. Schematic of study designs. (A) The natural course of health 
span is often a gradual decline in function (red dotted line) that results in 
disability or dependence when a certain threshold is crossed (black dashed 
line). Interventions that target aging processes and extend health span 
would delay the occurrence of disability or dependence by slowing this 
decline (blue solid line). (B) Health span may also be interrupted by an acute 
stressor, which may push the individual’s function (red dotted line) below 
the disability/dependence threshold (black dashed line), where the individual 
may remain after recovery from the stressor. The intervention may enhance 
the individual’s ability to recover back to independence (blue solid line).

 Population selection
Inclusion criteria would ideally be as broad as possible within the 
context of the trial design. The practice of excluding very elderly 
people or patients with extensive comorbidities (87) would be coun-
terproductive, because these people are those who would be most 
likely to benefit from interventions targeting basic aging mechanisms 
and for whom the interventions may ultimately be used. In many 
circumstances, it may make sense to stratify by frailty, function, 
comorbidities, or biomarkers upon enrollment and preferentially 
target those patients at higher risk for the primary outcome (88) to 
increase power and the likelihood of benefit.
A key consideration in selecting the study population is the degree 
of risk the population has for primary outcomes such as age-related 
morbidity and disability. This, in turn, affects the study size, study 
duration, and tolerable safety profile of the intervention. The exten-
sion of health-span study proposed earlier (Scenario 1) can illustrate 
these considerations. The study design would favor selection of older 
individuals (eg, age ≥ 65 years) who already manifest at least one 
age-related disease or condition, who are therefore at increased risk 
for age-related morbidity and disability. Study participants could 
manifest conditions that are considered risk factors for disease or 
disability, such as metabolic syndrome, mild cognitive impairment, 
or subclinical vascular disease or diseases that are not yet associated 
with significant dysfunction, such as hypertension and early stages 
of chronic kidney disease (CKD Stages 1 and 2). A study of a more 
intensive intervention might include patients with one or two overt 
age-related diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart 
failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, T2DM, mild dementia, 
cancer in remission, or more advanced stages of renal failure (CKD 
Stages 3 and 4). Optimizing the population selection in this way 
decreases the time needed to carry out the study and increases the 
probability of observing the effect of the study intervention. Going 
too far along the risk spectrum in either direction might be coun-
terproductive. For example, one might not include individuals with 
multiple major comorbidities or functional impairment, because at 
that point it may be too late to intervene in the aging process and 
the use of study drug may be contraindicated by the individual dis-
eases. Conversely, selection of older adults without any age-related 
diseases, disabilities, or preclinical conditions might make the study 
difficult to be carried out because the yearly incidence rate of disease 
or disability may be low and healthy older adults may actually pos-
sess factors that protect them from developing age-related condi-
tions. Thus, individuals living independently in the community who 
do not have significant disease burden, but have some manifestations 
of aging, would be the population of choice for a drug intervention 
trial. This selection strategy would also facilitate individuals’ partici-
pation in the study because they ideally would travel to study visits. 
Studies should also exclude individuals with limited life expectancy 
(<5 years), who would be unlikely to complete the relatively long 
follow-up period.
Intervention
Selecting a drug that is already in clinical use and that demonstrates 
a good safety profile with pleotropic effects on multiple systems may 
be ideal. Metformin is one such drug. It has been extensively studied 
and was shown to delay T2DM, reduce CVD, and improve overall 
survival (44,89,90). Alternatively, a new drug specifically developed 
to target the known pathways implicated in aging, such as mTOR-
inhibiting rapalogs or senescent-cell-clearing senolytics could be 
considered. The disadvantages of using a novel agent are several, 
including the need for pharmacokinetic data in older individuals, 
drug safety information, and the lack of knowledge about its effects 
on age-related dysfunction and diseases in humans. Combination 
therapy involving multiple drugs with nonoverlapping mechanisms 
is a therapeutic mainstay of many common diseases, including tuber-
culosis, coronary artery disease, HIV, and most cancers. Combination 
therapies targeting aging are already being tested in preclinical mod-
els and might be considered for human studies as well.
When deciding on the most effective dose, safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy must be balanced. In the case of metformin, the maximum 
recommended daily dose is 2,550 
mg per day. However, the risk of 
GI side effects is proportional to the dose, with most people tolerat-
ing a daily dose of 1,500–2,000 
mg without serious side effects (91). 
Thus, the dose can be titrated up to a maximum of 2,000 
mg per day 
in those who tolerate it and those who do not may be maintained on 
the maximum tolerated dose. Rapamycin may also need to be titrated 
based on tolerance, although there is evidence that some analogs 
of rapamycin are effective at low doses without significant adverse 
effects (67). In fact, it is not entirely certain that higher doses, or the 
doses used for treatment of overt disease (such as metformin for 
diabetes), will be more effective as an intervention targeting funda-
mental aging processes than lower doses. Preclinical studies can help 
inform initial dose selection, and doses can potentially be titrated to 
achieve similar biological effect (eg, AMPK activation) between pre-
clinical and human pilot studies. The ease of administration of the 
drug must also be considered. A drug taken orally, for example, may 
be preferable to one only available as an injection. Some drugs may 
have specific contraindications that must be considered in the study 
design. For example, metformin is contraindicated in renal impair-
ment, and so would not be suitable for a health-span study enroll-
ing many patients with advanced CKD. In addition, metformin is 
presently indicated for the treatment of T2DM, so participants with 
T2DM at baseline will need to be excluded from randomized trials 
using metformin. If a patient with T2DM is randomized to the pla-
cebo group, it would be ethically untenable to withhold an effective 
therapy from them, while experimentally unsound to permit them to 
receive the study drug “off-study.” As another example, rapamycin 
may inhibit wound healing and may not be appropriate for a resil-
ience study of postsurgical recovery. Drug interactions should also 
be considered, especially in older individuals who are often treated 
with multiple prescription or over-the-counter drugs and supple-
ments. One advantage of metformin is that it is not known to have 
serious interactions with commonly prescribed medications.
Choice of study drug is also influenced by the planned duration and 
intensity of the study. Whereas it may be acceptable to conduct a study 
of short duration or secondary prevention with an agent that is associ-
ated with more potential side effects or greater risk of toxicity, longer-
term or primary prevention studies should be conducted with a drug 
that is safe and well tolerated to ensure participant compliance through-
out the study period and to minimize the risk for cumulative toxicity. 
The duration of the study depends on its goals. Ultimately, a longitudi-
nal study of long duration that can capture delay or prevention of age-
related disease and disability would be the ideal test of effects on health 
span, potentially with a decade or more of follow-up. Before commit-
ting to a long-term health-span study, it would be prudent to carry out 
a shorter-duration or a pilot study that would not only help solidify the 
hypothesis for the longer study, but would also help resolve some of the 
issues surrounding participant, intervention, and outcomes selections. 
The duration of such a pilot study would be between 1 and 5 years. 
Studies of resilience could be designed to be shorter, as the outcomes of 
interest occur relatively soon after the acute event. The length of expo-
sure to potential toxicity or side effects is therefore shorter as well.

 The intervention itself might be as simple as a single drug or 
might be more complex. Single-drug simplicity may be helpful for tri-
als where a key goal is reverse translation studies to identify molecu-
lar mechanisms. However, additional complexity may ultimately be 
inevitable and desirable for trials intended to change clinical prac-
tice. Combinations of drugs acting on complementary pathways may 
maximize benefits and minimize side effects, and efficacy of drugs 
might be potentiated by simultaneous nondrug interventions (eg, 
exercise). For example, combining metformin with rapamycin may 
not only provide additional effects on fundamental aging processes 
but may also alleviate the insulin resistance and hyperglycemia 
related to rapamycin (92,93). If a two-drug combination is consid-
ered, a 2 
× 
2 trial design may be most informative, where the four 
treatment arms would include metformin alone, rapamycin alone, 
metformin with rapamycin, or placebo.
A randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial is the gold 
standard. The placebo in this case would likely include an inactive 
pill, but the current standard of care will also need to be incorpo-
rated into all study arms. In a health-span study (Scenario 1), diet 
and exercise counseling might be offered to all participants. In 
Example C of the resilience scenario (Scenario 2, rehabilitation after 
sepsis), the standard of care might include admission to an Acute 
Care of Elders unit and home-based rehabilitation after hospital dis-
charge. Indeed, existing geriatric-focused care programs both in and 
out of the hospital might provide an ideal framework for conducting 
these trials. Investigators should be comfortable with multifactorial 
interventions (94) and pragmatic study design (95) to reflect the cur-
rent standard of care in geriatrics and the nature of the population 
being targeted.
Measureable outcomes
The main outcome of interest would be whether an intervention can 
target fundamental aging processes as measured by age-related dis-
eases and functional disability. Using longevity itself as an outcome 
may not be feasible within a reasonable timeframe, and longevity 
with poor health or compromised function may not be a desirable 
outcome anyway. Therefore, disease-free survival or disability-free 
survival would be the primary outcomes of interest in clinical trials 
of agents that target fundamental aging processes. In a longitudi-
nal study of health span, this might be operationalized as time to 
incidence of a second or third age-related disease or impairment of 
a first activity of daily living. Although life span by itself may not 
be the outcome of choice, for reasons discussed earlier, mortality 
should be included among a composite of outcomes. Time between 
disability and death, end-of-life functional trajectory, and qual-
ity of death could be included in longer trials. Trials of resilience 
should also measure outcomes directly related to the stressor, such 
as antibody titers following vaccination or length of stay after elec-
tive surgery. For both trial scenarios, quantitative intermediate or 
secondary outcomes might include gait speed, grip strength, mobility 
stress test (Walking while Talking Test) (96,97), activities of daily 
living (ADLs), instrumental ADL (IADLs), and number of chronic 
prescription medications. Cognitive tests such as the Digit Symbol 
Substitution Test or Montreal Cognitive Test can be used to assess 
executive cognitive function (96,98).
Particularly for larger studies, the community of older adults 
can be involved in determining high-priority outcomes—perhaps, 
for example, independence in ADLs or avoiding institutionalization. 
This can be facilitated by academic–community partnership pro-
grams such as the Los Angeles Community Academic Partnership for 
Research in Aging (99) or through institutional community advisory 
boards. Such outreach could help build broader public support, 
enhance recruitment, assist in advocacy for funding, and ensure the 
relevance of the studies to the general population.
Recording clinical events like new onset of disease requires 
careful and systematic adjudication. After an event is reported, it 
must be reviewed and confirmed by experienced physicians. This 
involves obtaining the participants’ medical records, after receiving 
their informed consent, from medical institutions where the event 
was documented and/or treated. Adjudication of events is usually 
based on a set of prespecified criteria and is performed by a desig-
nated committee that is blinded to the intervention in order to ensure 
objectivity.
Longitudinal data collection would be helpful in studies of both 
health span and resilience. Resilience studies should collect baseline 
data prior to the intervention and/or stressor if possible, as well as 
at several time points after the stressor. All studies might collect bio-
logical samples at each of several time points, including blood and, 
where feasible, muscle, adipose tissue, and skin biopsies. Such bio-
logical samples would be crucial for reverse translation, biomarker 
validation, and possibly risk stratification. A patient registry could 
be maintained to facilitate long-term follow-up of age-related out-
comes. Furthermore, links to national or local clinical databases, 
with participant consent, would provide opportunity for addi-
tional collection of outcomes data even after the completion of the 
intervention study.
In certain situations, primary outcomes of clinical trials can 
be surrogate endpoint biomarkers that are highly predictive of an 
actual clinical event, such as high blood sugar, which is predictive of 
diabetes mellitus, or hypertension and increased circulating lipids, 
which are predictive of CVD. Such biomarkers can be used as end-
points for trials, but extensive testing and validation are required 
before they are accepted by the medical community and regulators 
in place of actual clinical events. At present, there are no validated, 
easily measurable biomarkers that predict age-related morbidity 
and disability in large populations. Potential biomarker candidates 
that have been linked to function and health span in older adults in 
limited studies include interleukin-6, IGF-1, and IGF binding pro-
teins (96). Development of reliable biomarkers or surrogate markers 
could dramatically accelerate aging research and should be one goal 
of initial pilot studies. As demonstrated earlier, multiple factors indi-
vidually or in combination may be considered as outcomes, with the 
concept of a composite outcome potentially being most representa-
tive of the complex physiology that accompanies aging.
Challenges
The aging population is diverse ethnically, genetically, socioeconomi-
cally, and physically. It is also heterogeneous in terms of diseases, 
co-comorbidities, and disabilities. This creates great challenges in 
designing a study, yet these challenges must be tackled to address 
the needs of the aging population. Many clinical trials have excluded 
older individuals precisely for these reasons, but in order for the 
clinical trial intervention to target the aging process itself and not 
only individual diseases, it must embrace this diversity across the 
older population.
Human physiology is complex, with perturbations in one system 
having effects on multiple systems. If an individual with T2DM sub-
sequently develops CVD, cancer, or Alzheimer’s disease, should these 
subsequent diseases be considered as independent outcomes of the 
aging process or did T2DM through hyperinsulinemia, hyperglyce-
mia, dyslipidemia, and inflammation increase the risk for these dis-
eases? Epidemiological data support the association between T2DM

 and increased risk of other diseases, and this would need to be con-
sidered in designing a trial.
A trial incorporating all the necessary diversity of the aging 
population would need to be powered sufficiently. This may pose 
a great challenge, because more homogenous studies have not 
always had sufficient power to detect multiple outcomes, despite 
enrolling thousands of patients. However, one advantage of a 
study targeting aging processes may be the very age of the par-
ticipants enrolled. Age is a major risk factor for most diseases 
and functional disability, thus the incidence of these events is 
expected to be greater in this population, which would translate 
into greater power to detect an effect. In addition, both sexes have 
to be represented adequately in a clinical trial. The numbers of 
individuals of each sex may need to be large enough so that the 
study will have sufficient power to detect sex-specific effects. This 
is important to consider, because several pathways implicated in 
the biology of aging appear to be sex specific, such as the GH/
IGF-1 axis (100).
The ultimate goals of clinical trials that test an aging intervention 
will include obtaining FDA approval for an aging-related indication. 
“Aging” is not currently an FDA indication, but plausible indications 
representative of aging-associated morbidity might include combina-
tions of age-related diseases (multimorbidity), ADL or IADL func-
tion, or defined geriatric syndromes such as frailty. A key goal of 
the first large clinical trials will be to define outcomes that are rep-
resentative of fundamental aging processes as well as acceptable to 
regulatory agencies as potential indications. Furthermore, impera-
tive to this goal is to identify outcomes that are clinically meaningful 
and not only statistically significant.
Recently, the FDA has increasingly utilized a process called 
“accelerated approval,” particularly for oncology drugs (101,102), 
which may provide a model for approval of repurposed drugs that 
target fundamental aging mechanisms while building evidence to 
support larger studies. In this route, the FDA approves drugs that 
show promising results in Phase 2, with the condition that the drug 
sponsor must still perform confirmatory Phase 3 studies. If the Phase 
3 study eventually indicates that the results did not meet the expec-
tations, that is, failure to reach the primary endpoint, or has previ-
ously unknown safety issues, the FDA would revoke its approval. 
For instance, bevacizumab was approved for metastatic breast can-
cer in 2008 under the FDA’s accelerated approval program. After the 
accelerated approval of bevacizumab for breast cancer, the drug’s 
sponsoring pharmaceutical company completed two additional 
clinical trials and submitted the data from those studies to the FDA. 
These data showed a very modest effect on cancer without evidence 
of improved survival or improvement in quality of life compared 
with taking standard chemotherapy alone—thus the FDA revoked 
the approval in 2011 (103).
For studies that target fundamental aging processes, if a Phase 
2 clinical trial shows efficacy with proof of concept, and an excel-
lent safety profile is demonstrated, then the trial may possibly lead 
to accelerated approval. The rationale for this conditional approval 
on the basis of a Phase 2 trial would be twofold. First, if efficacy is 
established in a major clinical outcome (eg, impact on the risk of age-
related chronic diseases such as dementia), then the benefits would 
greatly outweigh the risks given the impact on lessening chronic dis-
ease risk on an individual’s morbidity and quality of life (as well sub-
stantial cost savings both at the individual and public health levels). 
Second, a large Phase 3 trial might take a decade to complete, so the 
results of Phase 2 trials can help establish many therapeutic avenues 
in a shorter time period.
Funding sources
Valuable small pilot and proof-of-concept studies might be carried 
out within traditional funding mechanisms. These might test safety 
and dose ranges of interventions, correlate drug interventions with 
tissue biomarkers (eg, S6K activation from rapamycin), and provide 
preliminary data for effect sizes on physiological (eg, gait speed), 
disease (eg, CVD incidence), and functional (eg, ADL dependency) 
outcomes. Initially, larger clinical studies in either the health-span or 
resilience schemas that robustly test effects on disease can be funded 
in part by private, not-for-profit organizations, some of which have 
provided initial support. Although these studies are in the interest of 
the NIA, it may be difficult to cover the entire cost from NIA grants. 
As aging is a universal human condition and an inherently multi-
disciplinary field that affects a wide range of diseases, funding for 
such studies may turn out to be shared by other disease-focused NIH 
Institutes. If successful, a large landmark study is likely to be a one-
time effort, because once a precedent is established with the FDA 
to accept the notion that multimorbidities of aging can be targeted, 
larger studies will probably be led by the pharmaceutical industry, 
realizing this opportunity for drug development or repurposing in 
Phase 3 trials.
Example of an Intervention Study to Delay Aging 
Processes: 
Targeting Aging With Metformin
One tangible outcome of the NIH-sponsored retreat was the con-
ception of the Targeting Aging with Metformin (TAME) study 
hypothesizing that metformin will delay the onset of several major 
age-related diseases, thereby indicating its potential to extend health 
span and increase active life expectancy (104). Initial support for the 
study is currently from the American Federation for Aging Research, 
and it is co-ordinated with the FDA to approve multicomposite of 
age-related diseases as an accepted drug target. The TAME study 
is planned as a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial, 
enrolling approximately 3,000 individuals aged 65 years and older 
and will exclude variety of pre-existing conditions. The primary out-
come for this trial is the time to occurrence of any component of a 
multimorbidity composite, which includes coronary heart disease, 
stroke, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, cancer 
(driven mainly by breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung), T2DM, cog-
nitive impairment, and mortality. The study proposes to use a met-
formin dose of ~1,500 
mg per day. It is designed as a 6-year study, 
with a mean follow-up time of more than 3.5 years.
Summary
Clinical trials that target fundamental aging processes in humans 
are a novel concept that presents unique challenges and enormous 
opportunities. Challenges include selection of appropriate study 
populations, study designs, interventions, and outcomes. We pre-
sented two models that conceptualize trial designs for interven-
tions that target fundamental aging processes in long-term and 
acute settings, defined by extension of health span and resilience 
to acute stressors, respectively. However, in order to gain the 
full support of federal and private sectors for development of 
therapeutics that target aging in humans, it is important to have 
“aging” or aging-associated outcomes such as frailty, functional 
decline, and multimorbidity designated as conditions eligible for 
registration by the FDA. Evidence from human studies is emerg-
ing that indicates certain interventions can target multiple age-
related conditions simultaneously, potentially by interfering with

 the aging process itself. With the aging population projected to 
grow exponentially in the near future, clinical studies that can 
demonstrate the protective effect of these therapeutics during 
acute and chronic perturbations in aging humans are more timely 
than ever. Thus, delaying or preventing the disabilities that occur 
as a consequence of the aging process would result not only in tre-
mendous cost savings for the healthcare system but also in gains 
for society on the whole from the increase in productive contribu-
tions from older members of society (2).
