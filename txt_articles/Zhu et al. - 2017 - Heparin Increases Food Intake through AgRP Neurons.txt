SUMMARY
Although the widely used anticoagulant drug heparin
has been shown to have many other biological
functions independent of its anticoagulant role, its
effects on energy homeostasis are unknown. Here,
we demonstrate that heparin level is negatively
associated with nutritional states and that heparin
treatment increases food intake and body weight
gain. By using electrophysiological, pharmacological,
molecular biological, and chemogenetic approaches,
we provide evidence that heparin increases food
intake by stimulating AgRP neurons and increasing
AgRP release. Our results support a model whereby
heparin competes with insulin for insulin receptor
binding on AgRP neurons, and by doing so it inhibits
FoxO1 activity to promote AgRP release and feeding.
Heparin may be a potential drug target for food intake
regulation and body weight control.
INTRODUCTION
Heparin, a naturally occurring mucopolysaccharide, is produced
mainly by basophils and mast cells. Although heparin has been
widely used as an anticoagulant and antithrombotic drug in
therapeutic doses since the 1930s (McLean, 1959), endogenous
heparin’s physiological function is still unclear, and it has been
suggested that the main physiological role of heparin is not
anticoagulant. For example, heparin is conservatively expressed
in many mammalian and other vertebrate animals, including
lobster (Hovingh and Linker, 1982), clam (Pejler et al., 1987),
and Atlantic salmon (Flengsrud, 2016). These species do not
have a blood coagulant system similar to that of mice and
humans. Additionally, heparin is highly expressed in tissues
that have direct contact with the outside environment, including
lung, skin, and intestine, and is usually released when tissues are
injured (Nader et al., 1999). It has been proposed that like inflam-
mation, heparin release is the body’s response in vascular tis-
sues to harmful stimuli, contributing to defense against invading
bacteria or other alien materials.
Emerging evidence from both basic and clinic studies indi-
cates that heparin may play a role in the regulation of energy
homeostasis. For example, heparin has been shown to activate
lipoprotein lipase and interfere with lipid metabolism in rats
(Persson, 1988). Consistent with those findings, genetic analysis
in cattle found that genes involved in the heparin metabolism
pathway regulate lipid homeostasis (Jiang et al., 2011). Multiple
clinical cases also have demonstrated that obese patients have
inadequate levels of both fractionated and unfractionated hepa-
rin, suggesting a negative association between body weight
and serum heparin level (Allman-Farinelli, 2011; Dager, 2010;
Freeman et al., 2010). Furthermore, obese patients have low
heparin sensitivity and need a high heparin infusion rate to
reduce venous thromboembolism (Hurewitz et al., 2011; Myzien-
ski et al., 2010), and BMI is strongly associated with increased
rates of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (Bloom et al.,
2016). There is also some indirect evidence regarding another
member of the glycosaminoglycan family, heparan sulfate,
which shares a very similar structure with heparin. Both heparan
sulfate and its catalytic enzyme, heparanase, have been found
to regulate energy homeostasis (Karlsson-Lindahl et al., 2012;
Reizes et al., 2001; Strader et al., 2004; Zcharia et al., 2004,
2009). On the basis of these observations, we speculated that
heparin regulates body weight homeostasis.
In the present study, we first evaluated the physiological
relevance of endogenous heparin in different nutritional states.
We then investigated the effects of heparin treatment on food
intake and body weight gain. Furthermore, we used electro-
physiological recordings and designer receptors exclusively
activated by designer drugs (DREADD) to determine whether
hypothalamic neurons expressing agouti-related peptide (AgRP)
are required to mediate heparin’s effects on food intake. Finally,
we tested whether insulin signaling and the downstream mediator
FoxO1 in AgRP neurons mediate heparin’s effect on food intake.
RESULTS
Heparin Treatment Acutely Increases Food Intake
We found that serum heparin level was elevated during negative
energy balance including 7-day calorie restriction (CR) or 24 hr
fasting (Figure 1A). Consistent with this negative association
between heparin and nutritional states, food intake was elevated

 after intravenous (i.v.) injection of heparin (Figure S1A) in
male mice. Heparin stimulated food intake in a dose-dependent
manner, and its effects reached a plateau at a dose of 1 mg/kg.
The orexigenic effects of a single injection lasted for 6 hr.
Similarly, peripheral intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of heparin
(1 mg/kg) increased food intake in both male and female mice
1, 3, and 12 hr after injection (Figures 1B and 1C). More interest-
ingly, central delivery of heparin by intracerebroventricular
(i.c.v.) injection also promoted food intake in the first 6 hr after
injection in both male and female mice (Figures 1D and 1E),
suggesting a central mechanism for orexigenic effects of
heparin. Different from i.p. treatment, i.c.v. treatment with
heparin did not increase food intake 1 hr after injection in
male mice (Figures 1B and 1D), suggesting that a peripheral
mechanism may also be involved in the orexigenic effects of
heparin. Although we failed to observe any significant change
in serum ghrelin after i.p. injection of heparin in male mice
(Figure S1F), we found that heparin increased serum non-essen-
tial fatty acid (NEFA) and decreased glucose and insulin (Figures
S1B–S1E).

 If heparin plays a physiological role in feeding, the degradation
of heparin would lead to a decrease in food intake. To directly
test this possibility, the degradation of heparin was achieved
by i.p. injection of heparinase, which specifically catalyzes the
eliminative cleavage of polysaccharides from heparin. Food
intake was reduced following i.p. injection of heparinase in
both male and female mice (Figures 1F and 1G). Additionally,
the orexigenic effects of two other forms of heparin, desulfated
heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), were tested.
Desulfated heparin is a heparin derivative with the 2-O and 3-O
sulfate groups removed and lacks anticoagulant activity, while
LMWH is depolymerized from heparin and produces more
efficient anticoagulant activity. We found that i.c.v. injection of
desulfated heparin significantly increased food intake (Fig-
ure 1H), whereas different doses of LMWH administered by
either i.v. (Figure S1K) or i.p. (Figure 1I) injection did not affect
food intake. Hence, heparin activates food intake through a
central mechanism, and this effect is likely independent of its
anticoagulant activity.
To further determine how i.p. injection of heparin alters the
level of heparin in the circulation, we measured serum heparin
levels 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 hr after i.p. injection of 1 mg/kg heparin.
We found that after i.p. administration, heparin was rapidly
absorbed and efficiently entered the circulation (Figure S1L).
Peak serum concentration was reached within 1 hr after admin-
istration and was 4 times higher than the physiological
dose in saline-injected mice (0.772 ± 0.094 versus 0.197 ±
0.023 U/mL). Serum heparin remain elevated until 6 hr after injec-
tion. Although no concentration-effect relationship could be
established, with i.p. administration, heparin’s pharmacokinetic
parameters are consistent with time-response effects on food
intake, both of which are significant 1 and 3 hr after injection.
Long-Term Heparin Treatment Induces Body Weight
Gain in Mice
Considering the stimulatory effects of heparin on food intake, we
predicted that long-term treatment with heparin would increase
body weight. We found that chronic heparin treatment (i.p. for
16 days) substantially increased body weight gain in male mice
fed on chow (Figures 2A and 2D). Notably, heparin-treated
male mice started to gain significantly more body weight than
their saline-injected controls as early as 2 days after injection,
and their body weight gain remained higher during the entire
16-day period. A significant increase in fat mass was observed
in heparin-treated male mice compared with saline-treated con-
trol mice (Figures 2D and 2E), which was attributed mainly to
increased inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT; Figure 2F).
Consistently, the average adipocyte size of iWAT was signifi-
cantly larger in heparin-treated male mice than in saline-treated
control males (Figures 2G and 2H). Consistent with the acute
orexigenic effects of heparin, long-term treatment with heparin
also elevated cumulative food intake (Figure 2B). Energy expen-
diture was estimated by feed efficiency (the ratio between body
weight gain and cumulative food intake). Notably, the stimulatory
effects of heparin on feed efficiency indicate a decrease in
energy expenditure (Figure 2C). Additionally, the effects of
heparin on energy expenditure were also measured by the
Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS). A
single i.p. injection of heparin significantly decreased both heat
production and O2 consumption in the first 6 hr after injection
in the dark cycle (Figures S1M and S1N). Thus, our results sup-
port a model whereby heparin stimulates food intake and inhibits
energy expenditure to increase body weight and adiposity.
Similar to heparin-treated male mice, heparin-treated female
mice gained significantly more body weight (Figures 2I and 2L)
and fat mass after 16 days of treatment (Figure 2M). Consis-
tently, the size and weight of iWAT were significantly elevated
after
heparin
treatment
compared
with
controls
(Figures
2N–2P). Additionally, increased cumulative food intake (Fig-
ure 2J) and feed efficiency (Figure 2K) were also observed after
heparin treatment. Collectively, these data indicate that, similar
to males, heparin treatment led to early-onset increases in
body weight in female mice, associated with increased food
intake and reduced energy expenditure.
Heparin Activates AgRP Neurons in the Arcuate Nucleus
of the Hypothalamus
On the basis of observations that central administration of hep-
arin induces orexigenic effects, we postulated that a central
appetite-regulatory mechanism plays a role in the orexigenic
effects of heparin. We asked whether AgRP neurons in the hypo-
thalamus are regulated by heparin signals. We performed c-Fos
immunofluorescence in neuropeptide Y (NPY)-GFP mice, in
which NPY/AgRP neurons are labeled with GFP. We found that
heparin induced an increase of c-Fos expression in NPY/AgRP
neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH)
(Figures 3A and 3C), whereas heparinase, the heparin-degrading
enzyme, significantly decreased c-Fos expression in ARH
NPY/AgRP neurons in fasted mice (Figures 3B and 3D). These
data suggest that heparin activates AgRP neurons in the
ARH and that fasting-induced activation of AgRP neurons is
partially mediated by endogenous heparin. Additionally, we
also observed that i.v. injection of heparin dose-dependently
increased AgRP mRNA expression and decreased POMC
mRNA expression in the hypothalamus (Figure S2A). Consis-
tently,
both
i.v.
and
i.p.
injection
of
heparin
stimulated
hypothalamic AgRP and NPY protein expression and inhibited
hypothalamic POMC protein expression (Figures S2B and 3E).
These observations indicate that heparin activates ARH AgRP
neurons,
the
well-recognized
orexigenic
neuro-modulator
(Aponte et al., 2011).
In order to support this model, we used electrophysiology to
examine the effects of heparin on the neural activities of ARH
AgRP neurons. To this end, we crossed the Rosa26-tdTOAMTO
allele onto AgRP-Cre mice to selectively label all AgRP neurons
with red tdTOMATO fluorescence. Using these mice, we re-
corded electrophysiological responses to heparin (100 mg/mL,
4 min) in identified ARH AgRP neurons (Figure 4A). We found
that heparin caused depolarization from rest in all ten recorded
AgRP neurons (�45.26 ± 2.21 versus �41.90 ± 2.06 mV, p %
0.05; Figures 4B and 4E), while nine of ten recorded AgRP
neurons responded to heparin with an increased firing rate
(2.25 ± 0.35 versus 3.85 ± 0.55 Hz, p % 0.05; Figures 4B and
4D). To block presynaptic inputs from afferent neurons, tetrodo-
toxin (TTX; a potent sodium channel blocker), 6-cyano-7-nitro-
quinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; a competitive glutamate AMPA

 receptor antagonist), 2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid (AP-5;
a glutamate NMDA antagonist), and bicuculline (a competitive
GABAA receptor antagonist) were added to the bath solution.
In the presence of these blockers, heparin (100 mg/mL) treatment
still depolarized all recorded AgRP neurons (�53.68 ± 6.65
versus �49.38 ± 6.83 mV, n = 16; Figures 4C and 4F), suggesting
a direct stimulatory effect of heparin on AgRP neurons. This
proposition was further supported by our observations on
miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) and minia-
ture inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) of AgRP neurons
after heparin treatment. We found that heparin application
increased the amplitude of spontaneous mEPSC without

 changing its frequency (Figures 4G–4I), suggesting a postsyn-
aptic rather than a presynaptic mechanism of stimulation. Addi-
tionally, no AgRP neurons showed any changes of spontaneous
mIPSC after heparin treatment (Figures 4G, 4J, and 4K), which is
consistent with the stimulatory effects of heparin on AgRP
neurons. Together, these data consistently indicate that heparin
directly activates AgRP neurons in the ARH.
AgRP Neurons Mediate the Orexigenic Effects of
Heparin
To directly test if AgRP neurons mediate the stimulatory effects
of heparin on food intake, we used DREADD technology to
specifically inhibit AgRP neurons in functional mice. Specifically,
we generated AgRP-hM4Di mice by stereotaxically delivering
Cre-dependent
inhibitory
DREADD
virus
(pAAV-hSyn-DIO-
hM4D[Gi]-mCherry) into the ARH regions of AgRP-Cre mice
(Figure 5A). The CNO-driven activation of hM4Di hyperpolarized
membrane potential and decreased the firing rate of recorded
AgRP neurons and blocked heparin (100 mg/mL)-induced activa-
tion of AgRP neurons (Figures 5B–5D). CNO-mediated inhibition
of AgRP neurons significantly reduced food intake compared
with control mice without hM4Di expression treated with CNO
(Figure 5E), consistent with previous observations on orexigenic
effects of AgRP neurons (Krashes et al., 2011). Importantly,
DREADD-induced inhibition of AgRP neurons totally blocked
acute heparin-induced feeding (Figure 5F), suggesting a medi-
ating role of AgRP neurons in the orexigenic effects of heparin.
High-dose heparin treatment was also tested in our AgRP
inhibition model. We found that a 10-fold higher heparin dose
(1 mg/mL) failed to reverse the inhibitory effects of CNO on mem-
brane potential and firing frequency of recorded AgRP neurons
(Figures S3A–S3C), suggesting a dominant inhibitory effect of
CNO. After CNO was washed out, the stimulatory effects of hep-
arin (1 mg/mL) were regained, as demonstrated by an increased

 firing rate and an elevated membrane potential. Consistent with
electrophysiological recording, the orexigenic effects of high-
dose heparin (3 mg/kg) were also abolished by CNO-induced
AgRP inhibition (Figure S3D).
To further test if AgRP release is essential for orexigenic ef-
fects of heparin, we selectively expressed a Gs-linked DREADD
in the AgRP neurons (AgRP-rM3Ds). Previous studies have
shown that the activation of this receptor in AgRP neurons exclu-
sively increases the release of AgRP to stimulate food intake
(Nakajima et al., 2016). Consistent with those results, we found
that CNO-mediated activation of rM3Ds substantially increased
food intake (Figure 5G). More important, both the orexigenic
effects of heparin (Figure 5H) and the anorexigenic effects of
heparinase (Figure 5I) were abolished by CNO-mediated activa-
tion of rM3Ds in AgRP neurons, indicating that the release of
AgRP is required to mediate the orexigenic effects of heparin.
To further support this point of view, we co-injected heparin-
treated (0.2 mg, i.c.v.) mice with an anti-AgRP antibody (1 mg,
i.c.v.). Strikingly, the stimulatory effects of heparin on food intake
were completely blocked (Figure 5J). Taken together, our results
demonstrate that AgRP neuron activation and AgRP release are
required for the orexigenic effects of heparin.
Heparin Promotes Feeding by Binding to the Insulin
Receptor
We used hypothalamic N38 cells as a model to explore the
molecular mechanism for heparin’s actions in neurons. Consis-
tent with previous in vivo observations, we found that in vitro
12 hr heparin treatment dose-dependently increased the mRNA
and protein levels of AgRP in N38 cells (Figures S4A and S4B),
while in vitro high-dose heparin treatment (100 mg/mL) time-
dependently increased both the protein expression and secretion

 of AgRP (Figure S4C). These results indicate that heparin treat-
ment in N38 cells exerts the same stimulatory effects on AgRP
expression and secretion as in mice, which validated N38 cells
as a model to study heparin’s effects on AgRP neurons.
To examine how heparin interacts with the AgRP neuron mem-
brane, we performed heparin-Sepharose chromatography to
screen for the proteins or receptors that bind with heparin on
the membrane. We found that heparin interacts with insulin re-
ceptor (Figure 6A), which is the primary mediating receptor for
the anorexigenic effects of insulin in the brain (Br€
uning et al.,
2000). Importantly, after heparin treatment, we found that the
insulin-insulin receptor interaction was significantly reduced
(Figure 6B) and that insulin binding on the membrane was also
attenuated (Figure 6C), suggesting a disruption of insulin action
due to heparin binding to the insulin receptor. Consistent with
this view, heparin dose-dependently inhibited insulin receptor
substrate 1 (IRS-1) and phosphorylation of IRS-1 and protein ki-
nase B (Akt; insulin receptor downstream events) after 12 hr of

 heparin treatment (Figures S5A–S5D). A sustaining suppression
of IRS-1 and phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt was also de-
tected with high-dose heparin treatment (Figures S5E–S5H).
More important, similar dose-dependent inhibitory effects on
hypothalamic IRS-1 and phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt
were observed in heparin-treated mice (Figures 6D–6G). These
findings imply that heparin competes with insulin for insulin
receptor binding and disrupts the downstream insulin signaling
pathways.
On the basis of previous observations that blockade of hypo-
thalamic insulin receptors produces hyperphagia and weight
gain (Messier and Teutenberg, 2005), we predicted that heparin
promotes AgRP release and food intake through an insulin re-
ceptor-dependent pathway. Consistent with this view, we found
that heparin significantly increased AgRP promoter activity in
N38 cells, and this effect was abolished by insulin treatment
(Figure 6H). Electrophysiological recording of AgRP neurons
also demonstrated that the stimulatory effects of heparin
(100 mg/mL) on firing rate and membrane potential were abol-
ished by co-incubation with insulin (100 nM) (Figures 6I–6K).
Importantly, our in vivo data showed that insulin diminished the
increase of c-Fos expression in AgRP neurons induced by
heparin (Figures S6A and S6B), suggesting a blockade of
AgRP activation by insulin. This mechanism of appetite regula-
tion is further supported by evidence that the orexigenic effect
of heparin (0.2 mg, i.c.v.) in mice was blocked by co-injection of
0.2 pmol insulin (Figure 6L), while a high dose of heparin (2 mg)
attenuated the anorexigenic response of insulin (Figure S5I).
Hence, heparin increases food intake by competing with insulin
for insulin receptor binding on AgRP neurons.
Heparin Promotes AgRP Expression and Secretion
by FoxO1
On the basis of previous reports that FoxO1 transcription factor
is highly expressed in AgRP neurons and represents a key intra-
cellular component of pathways integrating AgRP-mediated
food intake and peripheral metabolic signals, including insulin
and leptin (Kitamura et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2012, 2015), we
examined whether FoxO1 is the intracellular mediator for stimu-
latory effects of heparin on AgRP neurons. We showed that
heparin treatment for 3 hr inhibited phosphorylation of FoxO1
in N38 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S7A). The
high dose of heparin had a sustaining suppression effect on
FoxO1 phosphorylation after 1 hr incubation (Figure S7B). Addi-
tionally, we also showed that heparin induced nuclear transloca-
tion of FoxO1 (Figure S7C). Consistently, long-term heparin
in vivo treatment (16 days) inhibited phosphorylation and
enhanced nuclei shuttling of FoxO1 in the hypothalamic neurons
from wild-type (WT) mice (Figures 7A and 7B). Given that
decreased phosphorylation and nuclei shuttling of FoxO1 tran-
scriptionally activate FoxO1 (Accili and Arden, 2004), and that
activation of FoxO1 increases AgRP expression (Kitamura
et al., 2006), these data support the hypothesis that heparin ac-
tivates FoxO1 to stimulate AgRP expression.
Supporting this hypothesis, we found that the binding activity
of FoxO1 on the AgRP promotor was significantly increased by
heparin treatment in N38 cells, and this effect was abolished
by insulin treatment (Figure 7C), suggesting insulin-dependent
regulatory effects of heparin on FoxO1. Furthermore, the results
of luciferase assay demonstrated that heparin significantly
increased AgRP promoter activity in N38 cells, and this stimula-
tory effect of heparin on the AgRP promoter was totally blocked
by co-treatment with AS1842856, a FoxO1 inhibitor (Figure 7D).
Consistent with this, AgRP protein expression was significantly
increased by heparin treatment in N38 cells, while co-treatment
of AS1842856 abolished this increase induced by heparin
(Figure 7E). Importantly, our in vivo data also showed that the
orexigenic effect of heparin (i.p.) in mice was diminished by co-
injection of AS1842856 (Figure 7F), indicating a physiological
role of FoxO1 in heparin’s orexigenic effects. Taken together,
our observations suggest a model whereby heparin activates
FoxO1 to stimulate AgRP expression, which in turn results in
increased food intake.
DISCUSSION
Although heparin has been one of the most important anticoag-
ulant and antithrombotic drugs in clinical practice for more than
80 years (McLean, 1959), it has many other pharmacological
functions, including anti-inflammatory (Young, 2008) and anti-
metastatic (Borsig, 2007; Mousa et al., 2006) effects and pro-
moting fat metabolism (Inderbitzin, 1955; Losonczy and Nagy,
1984; Roth et al., 1996; Stuchlı
´kova
´ et al., 1967), which are inde-
pendent of its anticoagulant effects. There is great potential for
the development of heparin-like compounds as drugs to treat
other diseases.
On the basis of previous findings in both clinical and basic
studies (Allman-Farinelli, 2011; Dager, 2010; Freeman et al.,
2010; Jiang et al., 2011; Persson, 1988), we predict that heparin
may play an important role in the regulation of energy homeosta-
sis. We found that negative nutritional states caused by long-
term CR or short-term overnight fasting induced an increase in
serum heparin level, suggesting a physiologically relevant role
for heparin in energy homeostasis regulation. This is further sup-
ported by the evidence that both peripheral and central heparin
treatment acutely increased food intake in both male and female
mice. A central mechanism was clearly demonstrated by the
strong stimulatory effect of i.c.v. heparin treatment. However, a
faster orexigenic response to i.p. treatment than to i.c.v. treat-
ment in male mice suggests that there may be a peripheral
mechanism. We observed rapid decreases in blood glucose
and insulin levels after i.p. heparin injection, which may be
peripheral mediators for orexigenic effects of heparin. Consis-
tent with its suppression of insulin, heparin has been well known
as a lipolytic factor (Persson, 1988) that interferes with the
production or secretion of lipogenic hormones such as insulin.
The inhibitory effects of heparin on blood glucose were also
consistently demonstrated in early clinical studies performed in
diabetic patients and healthy subjects (Bozadzhieva and Mar-
kovski, 1978). Decreased blood glucose and insulin may serve
as peripheral signals to promote food intake.
In contrast to heparin, heparinase, a heparin cleavage
enzyme, acutely decreased food intake in both sexes. Impor-
tantly, we also demonstrate that desulfated heparin, which lacks
anticoagulant activity, increases food intake, whereas LMWH,
with more efficient anticoagulant activity, does not affect food
Cell Reports 20, 2455–2467, September 5, 2017
2463
 intake. These results suggest that the orexigenic effects of
heparin are independent of its anticoagulant activity. Notably,
long-term heparin treatment in male and female mice led to a
phenotype reminiscent of that observed in heparanase global
knockout mice, which have increased heparan sulfate (Karls-
son-Lindahl et al., 2012), with an early-onset increase in
body weight due to increased fat. Increased body weight was
associated with increased food intake and decreased energy
expenditure, as indicated by elevated feed efficiency and heat
production. Thus, our data support a model in which heparin in-
duces body weight gain by stimulating food intake and inhibiting
energy expenditure through a central mechanism.
Heparin is a large mucopolysaccharide with a molecular
weight of 12,000–15,000 g/mol, which does not cross the
blood-brain barrier. However, circulating heparin may reach
the ventromedial part of the ARH of the hypothalamus via the
leaky blood-brain barrier and elicit its physiological functions
(Faouzi et al., 2007; Rodrı
´guez et al., 2010). On the basis of

 previous observations that the inhibitory effects of heparanase
on food intake were abolished in melanocortin 4 receptor
(MC4R) global knockout mice (Karlsson-Lindahl et al., 2012), a
role for the MC4R neural pathway in the regulatory effects of
heparanase on food intake has been suggested. As a first step
to investigate the central mechanism of the regulatory effects
of heparin on food intake, we asked whether heparin signals
regulate the expression of two hypothalamic neuropeptides in
the ARH, AgRP and POMC, which are well known as endoge-
nous antagonists or agonist precursors of MC4R in the brain
(Biebermann et al., 2012). We found that i.p. injection of heparin
significantly increased AgRP and decreased POMC protein
expression in the hypothalamus. Moreover, heparin enhanced
c-Fos expression of AgRP neurons when mice were fed, while
heparinase attenuated fasting-induced c-Fos expression in
AgRP neurons, indicating that heparin may enhance AgRP
expression by activating AgRP neurons. Consistent with this
view is our finding that heparin electrophysiologically increased
firing frequency and membrane potential of NPY/AgRP neurons.
Importantly, these effects were completely independent of pre-
synaptic inputs, suggesting a direct stimulatory action of heparin
on AgRP neurons.
Given that heparin activates AgRP neurons, and that activa-
tion of AgRP neurons increases food intake (Aponte et al.,
2011; Krashes et al., 2013), we postulate that heparin increases
food intake by activating AgRP neurons. This hypothesis is
supported by the observation that DREADD-induced inhibition
of AgRP neurons blocked the orexigenic effects of heparin. On
the basis of the observation that hypothalamic AgRP expression
was stimulated by heparin treatment, we predicted that AgRP is
an essential mediator for the orexigenic effects of heparin.
Consistent with this hypothesis, anorexigenic effects of heparin-
ase were abolished by chemogenetic increasing of AgRP release
from AgRP neurons by using Gs-linked DREADD. On the other
hand, we also found that heparin failed to further increase
feeding after artificial stimulation of AgRP release. Besides this
chemogenetic evidence, we also pharmacologically demon-
strated that stimulatory effects of heparin on food intake were
diminished by anti-AgRP antibody. Taken together, the orexi-
genic effects of heparin are at least partially mediated by stimu-
lating AgRP neurons to increase the release of AgRP.
As important central regulators of energy homeostasis, AgRP
neurons release three different mediators, inducing the neuro-
peptides NPY and AgRP and the fast-acting neurotransmitter
GABA to regulate feeding and other aspects of energy balance
(Liu et al., 2013). Changes in AgRP neuron activity lead to alter-
ations in the release of these three mediators. Previously, neuro-
peptide AgRP was shown to induce feeding over a 2 hr delayed
yet prolonged period (Krashes et al., 2013). This slow-acting
orexigenic effect of AgRP is in conflict with the acute feeding
response (within 2 hr) induced by heparin, suggesting that
another fast-acting mechanism for heparin’s orexigenic effects
also exists. This acute effect of heparin may involve NPY or
GABA release from AgRP neurons. Supporting this, we found
that heparin acutely stimulates AgRP neurons, which may lead
to alterations in the release of not only AgRP but also NPY and
GABA. Additionally, i.v. injection of heparin increased not only
AgRP but also NPY protein in the hypothalamus.
In order to explore the molecular mechanism of how heparin
interacts with AgRP neurons to increase AgRP release, we
screened
for
the
physiologically
relevant
heparin-binding
proteins or receptors in hypothalamic cell lines. We found that
heparin interacts with insulin receptor and competes with insulin
for insulin receptor binding, and by doing so, it decreases
phosphorylation of downstream mediators, including IRS-1
and Akt, suggesting a disruption of the insulin signaling pathway.
We also confirmed this disruption in the mouse hypothalamus
after i.p. heparin treatment. Insulin, an anorectic hormone, has
been shown to regulate feeding and body weight mainly through
inhibition of AgRP and activation of POMC (Qiu et al., 2014;
Varela and Horvath, 2012). This result prompted us to examine
whether heparin promotes AgRP release and feeding by
blockade of insulin receptors on AgRP neurons. We found that
heparin increases the promotor activity of AgRP gene, which is
consistent with the stimulatory effects of heparin on AgRP pro-
tein expression. Importantly, this increase is blocked by insulin
treatment, suggesting an insulin receptor-dependent pathway.
Moreover, central treatment of insulin significantly decrease
food intake, as previously reported (Brown et al., 2006), and
orexigenic effects of heparin were totally diminished by co-injec-
tion with insulin. Thus, our observations indicate that heparin
promotes feeding by binding with insulin receptors.
FoxO1, a forkhead family member of transcription factors,
represents a shared component of pathways integrating cen-
tral AgRP and POMC actions on food intake and peripheral
signals such as leptin and insulin (Kitamura et al., 2006; Ren
et al., 2012, 2015). On the basis of these reports, we postulate
that FoxO1 may also play an important role in integrating pe-
ripheral heparin signal and central AgRP-mediated feeding.
Consistent with this view, we found that heparin decreased
phosphorylation and increased nuclei shuttling of FoxO1
both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a stimulatory effect on
the FoxO1 signaling pathway. Because activation of FoxO1
is required for fasting-induced AgRP expression (Kitamura
et al., 2006), FoxO1 may mediate heparin’s stimulatory effects
on AgRP. This is further supported by the evidence that hep-
arin increased the binding activity of FoxO1 on the AgRP
promoter and that this increase was blocked by insulin,
suggesting that heparin regulates FoxO1 transcriptional activ-
ity on the AgRP promoter through an insulin receptor-depen-
dent mechanism. Moreover, the stimulatory effects of heparin
on AgRP promoter activity, AgRP protein expression, and food
intake were abolished by AS1842856, an antagonist of FoxO1,
indicating
a
physiologically integrating
pathway involving
FoxO1 for the AgRP-dependent effects of heparin on food
intake.
In conclusion, we report for the first time that heparin, previ-
ously well recognized as an anticoagulant and antithrombotic
drug, plays an important role in the regulation of food intake
and energy homeostasis. We further demonstrate that the
orexigenic effects of heparin are driven by insulin receptor-
FoxO1-mediated AgRP activation. Our findings identify heparin
as a potential drug target for body weight regulation, and
additional studies are warranted to assess the effects of
heparin-based compounds on body weight control and energy
homeostasis.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
All groups within one experiment contained individual mice of the same strain
and sex, similar in body weight and age. All mice were aged 10–18 weeks at the
time when the experiments were performed. Mice were housed in a tempera-
ture-controlled environment (20�C–26�C) on a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle
(6 a.m. and 6 p.m.). Unless otherwise stated, the mice were maintained ad
libitum on standard mouse chow and water.
Metabolic Effects of Heparin
Short-term food intake was measured after i.p., i.v., or i.c.v. injection of heparin
in both male and female adult mice. Long-term body weight gain and food
intake were measured every other day after i.p. injection of 1 mg/kg heparin
in both sexes. Body composition, fat mass, and adipocyte size were determine
after 16 days of heparin treatment.
Effect of Heparin in Regulation of AgRP Neurons
Expression of c-Fos by AgRP neurons and hypothalamic AgRP mRNA and
protein expression were measured after i.p. injection of 1 mg/kg heparin in
male adult mice. Direct electrophysiological responses of AgRP neurons to
heparin were determined ex vivo. AgRP neurons were chemogenetically
inhibited or activated to determine if AgRP neurons mediate the orexigenic
effects of heparin in male adult mice.
Cellular Signal Mechanisms of Heparin-Induced AgRP Activation
Heparin’s effects on insulin-insulin receptor interaction were determined in
both in vitro N38 cells and in vivo in the hypothalamus of male adult mice. Elec-
trophysiological responses of AgRP neurons to heparin and insulin co-treat-
ment were determined ex vivo. Feeding behavior was monitored after heparin
(0.2 mg) and insulin (0.2 pmol) i.c.v. co-treatment in female adult mice.
Heparin’s effects on phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of FoxO1
were determined in both in vitro N38 cells and in vivo in the hypothalamus of
male adult mice. Feeding behavior was monitored after heparin (0.2 mg) and
AS1842856 (20 pmol, a FoxO1 inhibitor) i.c.v. co-treatment in female adult
mice.
