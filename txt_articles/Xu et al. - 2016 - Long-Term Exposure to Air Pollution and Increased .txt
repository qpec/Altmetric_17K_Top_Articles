ABSTRACT
The effect of air pollution on the changing pattern of glomerulopathy has not been studied. We estimated
the profile of and temporal change in glomerular diseases in an 11-year renal biopsy series including 71,151
native biopsies at 938 hospitals spanning 282 cities in China from 2004 to 2014, and examined the asso-
ciation of long-term exposure to fine particulate matter of ,2.5 mm (PM2.5) with glomerulopathy. After age
and region standardization, we identified IgA nephropathy as the leading type of glomerulopathy, with a
frequency of 28.1%, followed by membranous nephropathy (MN), with a frequency of 23.4%. Notably, the
adjusted odds for MN increased 13% annually over the 11-year study period, whereas the proportions of
other major glomerulopathies remained stable. During the study period, 3-year average PM2.5 exposure
varied among the 282 cities, ranging from 6 to 114 mg/m3 (mean, 52.6 mg/m3). Each 10 mg/m3 increase in
PM2.5 concentration associated with 14% higher odds for MN (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval,
1.10 to 1.18) in regions with PM2.5 concentration .70 mg/m3. We also found that higher 3-year average air
quality index was associated with increased risk of MN. In conclusion, in this large renal biopsy series, the
frequency of MN increased over the study period, and long-term exposure to high levels of PM2.5 was
associated with an increased risk of MN.

 primary glomerulopathy in some countries.6,13,15 The tempo-
ral change in the pattern of primary glomerulopathy, especially
within comparable ethnic groups in different countries, sug-
gests the presence of unidentified environmental factors that
have clinically significant effects on primary glomerular dis-
ease. However, no published studies have evaluated the effect of
environmental factors on the changing pattern of glomerular
diseases.
China comprises 20% of the world population. With rapid
developments in its economy and urbanization, especially during
thepastdecade,airpollutionhasbecomeapublichealthproblemin
some cities.16 Exposure to air pollution, especially particulate mat-
ter of ,2.5 mm (PM2.5), has been associated with increased death
and incidence of cardiovascular events.17–19 Animal studies have
shown that exposure to fine particulate promotes the production
of autoantibodies and immune complexes and results in immune
dysregulation20,21 which is implicated in the pathogenesis of some
glomerulopathies. These findings led us to hypothesize that long-
term exposure to air pollution may cause temporal changes in the
profile of glomerulopathy in China. To date, the nationwide trend
and composition of glomerulopathies has not been described, al-
though several single-center biopsy series have reported the fre-
quency of glomerular disease in China.11,22
In this study, we analyzed data from an 11-year renal biopsy
series including 71,151 patients from 938 hospitals in 282 cities
across China, encompassing all age groups and both tertiary
and community hospitals, to evaluate the nationwide com-
position and secular pattern of glomerular diseases. We further
examined the association between long-term exposure to
PM2.5 and specific types of glomerular diseases.
RESULTS
Study Participants
The study sample consisted of 71,151 independent cases with
biopsy-proven glomerular diseases, from 938 hospitals across
China (Supplemental Figure 1). The demographic and clinical
characteristics of the series are presented in Table 1. The study
population comprised mainly young to middle-aged adults
(89%), with an average age of 37.3 years, split equally in gender
but imbalanced in geographical presentation, hospital level, and
year of biopsy. Over the study period, the numbers of biopsy
patients and hospitals performing biopsy significantly increased.
The percentage of patients aged .65 years increased from 3.3%
in the period 2004 to 2006, to 6.0% in the period 2013 to 2014.
Nephrotic syndrome (45.4%) and urinary abnormality (40.4%)
were the most common indications for biopsy. The percentage of
patients that received a biopsy due to nephrotic syndrome grad-
ually increased, while those that were performed due to urinary
abnormality decreased during the study period.
Composition and Secular Pattern of Glomerulopathy
Of the 70,626 patients with single glomerular disease, 77.5%
had primary glomerulopathy. The disease spectrum varied
with age (Table 2). After age and region standardization, IgAN
was the most common glomerulopathy during the study pe-
riod, accounting for 36.3% of the primary glomerulopathies,
followed by membranous nephropathy (MN; 30.2%). MN
was the leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults aged
.40 years, while minimal change disease (MCD) was the most
common histologic diagnosis among those aged #39 years
(Table 3).
There was a remarkable rising trend in the frequency of MN
over the period 2004 to 2014, while the frequencies of the other
major glomerulopathies remained stable (Figure 1). The rising
trend in MN was observed among all age groups and in all
regions (Supplemental Figure 2). Estimated by a generalized
additive model with adjustments for age, gender, geographic
region, pathologic laboratory, level of hospital for biopsy, and
clinical syndrome, the frequency of MN doubled from 2004
(12.2%) to 2014 (24.9%). On average, the odds of MN in-
creased by 13% annually (odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% confi-
dence interval [95% CI], 1.12 to 1.15).
During the year of 2014, a total of 399 patients with biopsy-
proven MN without features of secondary disease had been
tested for glomerular deposits of phospholipase A2 receptor, of
which 332 (83%) were positive, validating the diagnosis of
primary MN.
Air Pollution and Increased Frequency of MN
Frequency of MN varied greatly among geographical regions
(Figure 2A). In our study, the frequency of MN was higher in
the northern region, especially in Hebei province, the most
polluted area in China (Figure 2B). This finding led us to
hypothesize that air pollution might be associated with in-
creased risk of MN. The 3-year average PM2.5 derived from
the aerosol optical depth (AOD) data23 among the 282 cities
ranged from 6 to 114 mg/m3 from 2004 to 2014 (Supplemental
Table 1). The study-wide mean PM2.5 level increased from
45.9 mg/m3 in 2004 to 55.7 mg/m3 in 2008 and was slightly
reduced afterwards. The average annual increase in PM2.5 con-
centration (PM2.5 slope) was 0.85 mg/m3 per year, with the
highest increase (3.2 mg/m3 per year) observed in the cities in
Hebei province.
Higher levels of PM2.5 exposure were associated with an in-
creased risk of MNafter adjusting for confounders including age,
gender, geographic region, level of hospital for biopsy, pathologic
laboratory, clinical syndrome, and year of biopsy (Figure 2C).
The relationship appeared to be nonlinear: each increase of
10 mg/m3 was associated with 14% higher odds for MN (OR,
1.14; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.18) at PM2.5 concentration above
70 mg/m3; the curve was flat at PM2.5 below 70 mg/m3 (OR,
1.02; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.04). The annual increase in odds for
MN was greater in the cities with a higher PM2.5 slope even after
adjusting for geographic region (P=0.03) (Figure 2D, Supplemen-
tal Figure 3). Assuming a causal relationship, 15.2% of MN in
China could be attributable to PM2.5 air pollution exposure.
As a validation to the exposure measurement, similar
associations of MN with 3-year average air quality index

 (AQI) during 2012 to 2014 and average PM2.5 level measured
by local monitors during 2014 were also observed (Figure 2, E
and F).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first and the largest study of a
nationwide biopsy series to examine the effect of air pollution
on the changing pattern of glomerular diseases in China.
Among 71,151 native renal biopsies encompassing all age
groups from both tertiary and community hospitals across the
country, we found a remarkable rise in the proportion of MN
over a period of 11 years from 2004 to 2014. We also found that
long-term(3-yearaverage)exposuretohighlevelsofPM2.5was
associated with an increased risk of idiopathic MN, an auto-
immune glomerulonephropathy involving the formation of
circulating autoantibodies and immune complex deposits in
the kidney.24
In this study, we compared the frequencies of various
glomerular diseases among age groups and clinical syndromes.
IgAN was the most frequent glomerular disease with an age-
and region-standardized frequency of 28.1% during the study
period, accounting for 36.3% of all primary glomerulopathies.
This is consistent with other studies from Asia, Australia,
Europe, and some regions of the United States.11–14 Interest-
ingly, MN emerged as the most frequent biopsy finding in
patients aged .40 years. An age- and region-standardized fre-
quency of MN was recorded in 23.4% of all biopsies, second in
frequency to IgAN. A high frequency of MN has been reported
in multiple studies of the elderly, especially those aged .65
years.5,10,25 In our series, nephrotic syndrome was the indica-
tion for biopsy in 45.4% of the population. MN was the lead-
ing cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults aged .40 years,
while MCD was the most common histologic diagnosis
among those aged #39 years.
An important finding from this study is the remarkable
rising trend in the frequency of MNover the past decade. From
2004 to 2014, the adjusted frequency of MN increased from
12.2% to 24.9% in this Chinese population. The risk for MN
increased 13% annually in a regression analysis with adjust-
ments for the confounders, including age and clinical char-
acteristics. Projected from this trend, MN would soon pass
IgAN to become the leading type of nephropathy in China.
Although these results need to be interpreted in the context of
an increasingly aggressive diagnostic approach to glomerular
disease, this is unlikely to be the main cause for the increasing
trend in MN frequency due to the following reasons. First, in

 our regression analysis of the trend, we
adjusted for confounders including age,
gender, region, clinical syndrome, patho-
logic laboratory, and hospital level for
biopsy. Hence, the effects of aging and
increased frequency in nephrotic syndrome
in the biopsy population were already
controlled. Second, the proportion of other
major biopsy-proven glomerulopathies re-
mained fairly stable during the study pe-
riod, and the proportion of secondary MN,
such as lupus nephritis and hepatitis
B-associated nephritis, did not show a sim-
ilar trend in the same population. Consis-
tent with the previousreports,26 most of the
MN in our study were phospholipase A2
receptor-related, validating the diagnosis
of primary MN. Third, there has been con-
sistency in both the pathologic procedures
and interpretations of biopsy specimens in
the pathologic centers in charge of histologic
diagnosis, and there were no substantial
changes in the diagnosis of MN or differen-
tiation of MN from other primary glomeru-
lar disease over the study period.
The large biopsy series with a wide cov-
erage of 282 cities across China allowed us
to examine the effect of exposure to air pol-
lution on the risk of MN in the country.
From 2004 to 2014, 3-year average levels
of AOD-derived PM2.5 in the study cities
have been increasing up to a plateau in
2008 (Supplemental Table 1). In 2008,

 levels of PM2.5 exposure varied from 8.1 to 110.5 mg/m3 among
the study cities with a mean of 55.6 mg/m3. This level was much
higher than that in many developed countries, such as the United
States (mean, 12 mg/m3), the United Kingdom (mean, 14 mg/m3),
and Japan (mean, 10 mg/m3), and was comparable to developing
countriessuchasIndia(mean,59mg/m3).27Mostimportantly,we
found that long-term exposure to high levels of PM2.5 was asso-
ciated with an increased risk of MN after controlling for con-
founders including age, gender, region, year of biopsy, pathologic
laboratory, level of hospital for biopsy, and clinical syndrome.
Each increase of 10 mg/m3 was associated with 14% higher
odds for MN (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.18) in regions with
PM2.5concentrationsabove70mg/m3.SimilarassociationsofMN
with 3-year average AQI and PM2.5 level measured by local mon-
itors were also observed. The annual increase in odds for MN was
greater in the cities with higher PM2.5 slopes, even after adjusting
for geographic region (P=0.03), though per capita disposable in-
come, and educationaland health care resources werecomparable
among these cities (Supplemental Table 2). Similarly, a previous
study showed that neither education level nor household income
significantly modified the relationship be-
tween air pollution and cardiovascular dis-
ease.17 It is noteworthy that a rising trend in
MN was also reported in India,28 a country
with a high level of environmental exposures.
In comparison, MN was shown to be declin-
ing in other East Asian countries with low ex-
posure levels, such as Japan29 and Korea.30
The mechanism(s) by which long-term
exposuretofineparticulateair pollutionmay
increase the risk of MN remains to be
elucidated. MN has been recognized as an
autoimmune disease characterized by the
formation of circulating autoantibodies and
subepithelial immune complex deposits in
the kidney.24Animalstudieshave shownthat
exposure to fine particulate promotes the
production of autoantibodies and immune-
complexes.20,21 It has been hypothesized that
cytokinesgeneratedintheairwaysinresponse
to air pollution can spill over into the circu-
lation, influencing autoimmune responses
and distant events.31 Supporting this notion,
air pollution increases the circulating levels of
inflammation mediators such as TNF-a, IL-
6, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-
1,21,32,33 and genetic polymorphisms in these
cytokines are associated with the develop-
ment of MN.34–38 It would also be interesting
to test the existence of any interactions be-
tween PM2.5 exposure and the genetic poly-
morphisms implicated in MN.39
There were limitations in our study.
First, our study was based on a renal biopsy
series. Without registry data or sampling
information for the biopsy specimens, we were not able to
estimate the biopsy rate or incidence of glomerulopathy in the
general population. However, under the setting of no temporal
changes in the incidences of other glomerulopathies, an
increased frequency of MN implies increased incidence of
the disease. Second, information on patient residence was
limited to thecitylevel.As aresult, we used citywide averages of
PM2.5 to approximate the individual exposures in the analysis,
which may have led to an underestimation of the effect of
PM2.5. The large number of cities included in our study and
the great variation in PM2.5 levels among these cities should
have helped to alleviate this problem. Third, the PM2.5 data we
used in the analysis was not directly measured but derived
from the satellite AOD. However, we found similar patterns
of association between MN and the ground-based PM2.5 levels
as well as AQIs in our analysis (Figure 2, E and F). A good
agreement between AOD-derived and ground-based PM2.5
levels has also been reported previously.23 Finally, our study
investigated the long-term (3-year) effect of PM2.5 in a pop-
ulation with an unusually high level of exposure; the results

 may not be ascribed to a short-term effect or generalized to a
lower level of exposure.
We confirmed a significant rising trend in the frequency of
MN, which in our data was second only to IgAN as the leading
type of glomerular disease in China. We provided evidence for
the association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and risk
for MN, especially at a high level of exposure. Our results call
for further investigation on this topic using animal models and
population-based prospective cohort studies.
CONCISE METHODS
Data Source
We collected data from six central pathologic
laboratories on 75,163 renal biopsies from 938
hospitals spanning 282 cities across China, over an
11-year period from January 2004 to December
2014. The data, which was extracted from referral
records and pathologic reports of renal biopsies,
included: age, gender, city of residence, date and
hospital performing the biopsy, clinical syndrome,
laboratory measurements, and histologic diagno-
sis.Inthecurrentanalysis,weexcludedthepatients
without histologic diagnosis (374), those with
repeated biopsies (714) and kidney graft (250),
and those with missing demographic or clinical
data (927). We further excluded the patients with
isolated tubulointerstitial renal diseases (1747).
The remaining 71,151 independent native biopsies
with glomerular disease were subsequently ana-
lyzed. The Medical Ethics Committee of Nanfang
Hospital, Southern Medical University approved
the study protocol and waived patient consent.
Histologic Specimens and Diagnosis
Allrenalbiopsieswereprocessedandassessedatsix
central pathologic laboratories. Biopsy specimens
were routinely analyzed by light microscopy and
immunohistologic assays. In addition, 64% of the
biopsy specimens in the series were also examined
byelectronmicroscopy.Thehistologicresultswere
interpreted by six leading histopathologists. The
histologic findings were classified according to the
“Revised Protocol for the Histological Typing of
Glomerulopathy” (WHO,1995)40 and categorized
into primary, secondary, mixed (patients with two
concurrent glomerular diseases), and unclassified
glomerular diseases. The primary glomerular dis-
eases included IgAN, MN, MCD, FSGS, mesangial
proliferative GN, membranoproliferative GN
type 1, and others.
Data on Air Pollution Exposure
We obtained the 3-year average PM2.5 grid data
from 2004 to 2012, derived from satellite AOD
at a resolution of 0.130.1 degrees (longitude by
latitude),23 from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center,
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In the current study, we
estimated long-term exposure to PM2.5 as the mean of the 3-year average
PM2.5 levels prior to the year of biopsy within an area of 131 degrees
centered on the city of residence. In years 2013 and 2014, the PM2.5 data
were not available and were substituted by the PM2.5 data for 2012.
PM2.5 data from local monitors in many cities were not publically
available until late 2013. We were able to obtain monthly averages of
locally measured PM2.5 levels in 145 study cities during 2014, and

 used the yearly average in the analysis. The 3-year average AQIs of 162
cities in China from 2012 to 2014 were calculated from the daily AQIs
reported by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China
(http://datacenter.mep.gov.cn). AQI uses whichever pollutant is the
highest on the day, so it is not specific to a single pollutant. Neverthe-
less, PM2.5 was the principal pollutant on two thirds of the days with
AQI$100 during 2012 to 2014. The average AQIs of the cities without
actual measurements were estimated by two-dimensional (longitude
and latitude) smoothing of the AQI in nearby cities using the ‘mgcv’ R
package.41
Statistical Analyses
We calculated the frequency of each glomerulopathy among all
biopsy-proven glomerular diseases excluding mixed glomerular
diseases. We used the age structure in the total biopsy population
as the reference to calculate the age-adjusted frequency of each
glomerulopathy in a region, and derived the overall standardized
frequency as the average of all region-specific and age-adjusted
frequencies weighted by the population sizes of the regions. We used a
generalized additive logistic model to estimate the trend in frequency
of each glomerulopathy (change in odds for the glomerulopathy and
thecorrespondingproportionamongpatientswithbiopsy)duringthe
study period with adjustments for age, gender, region, pathologic
laboratory, hospital level, and clinical syndrome. We also used a
generalized additive logistic model to estimate the effects of 3-year
average PM2.5 level on MN with adjustments for age, gender, region,
pathologic laboratory, hospital level, year of biopsy, and clinical syn-
drome. We sought to confirm the association between air pollution
and MN under the same statistical model, using the 3-year average
AQI from 2012 to 2014 and the average PM2.5 level measured by local
monitors during 2014, respectively, as the pollution exposures, and
limiting the biopsy series to 2012 to 2014. We estimated the popula-
tion attributable fraction of PM2.5 on MN empirically as the percent-
age of reduction in MN frequency under the generalized additive
model if PM2.5 exposure was reduced to 10 mg/m3. We calculated
the rate of annual change in PM2.5 (PM2.5 slope) in an area as the
slope of a simple linear regression of PM2.5 with calendar year during
the period 2004–2012. We divided 282 cities into “low”, “medium”,
and “high” groups by PM2.5 levels and PM2.5 slopes, respectively,
using the corresponding 25th and 75th percentiles as the cutoffs.
We compared the annual increases in odds for MN among different
levels of PM2.5 and PM2.5 slope using the logistic regression model
with adjustments for age, gender, region, pathologic laboratory, hos-
pital level, and clinical syndrome. We used R version 3.2.0 for the
statistical analyses, and, more specifically, the “mgcv” package version
1.8–6 for the generalized additive model.41
