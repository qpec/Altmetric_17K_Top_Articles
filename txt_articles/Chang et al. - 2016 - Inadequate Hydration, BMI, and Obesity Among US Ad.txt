Inadequate Hydration, BMI, and Obesity Among US 
Adults: NHANES 2009-2012
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Improving hydration is a strategy commonly used by clinicians to pre-
vent overeating with the goal of promoting a healthy weight among patients. 
The relationship between weight status and hydration, however, is unclear. Our 
objective was to assess the relationship between inadequate hydration and BMI 
and inadequate hydration and obesity among adults in the United States.
METHODS Our study used a nationally representative sample from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009 to 2012, and included 
adults aged 18 to 64 years. The primary outcome of interest was body mass 
index (BMI), measured in continuous values and also categorized as obese (BMI 
≥30) or not (BMI <30). Individuals with urine osmolality values of 800 mOsm/
kg or greater were considered to be inadequately hydrated. Linear and logistic 
regressions were performed with continuous BMI and obesity status as the out-
comes, respectively. Models were adjusted for known confounders including age, 
race/ethnicity, sex, and income-to-poverty ratio.
RESULTS In this nationally representative sample (n 
= 
9,528; weighted n 
= 
193.7 
million), 50.8% were women, 64.5% were non-Hispanic white, and the mean 
age was 41 years. Mean urine osmolality was 631.4 mOsm/kg (SD 
= 
236.2 
mOsm/kg); 32.6% of the sample was inadequately hydrated. In adjusted models, 
adults who were inadequately hydrated had higher BMIs (1.32 kg/m2; 95% CI, 
0.85-1.79; P <.001) and higher odds of being obese (OR 
= 
1.59; 95% CI, 1.35-
1.88; P <.001) compared with hydrated adults.
CONCLUSION We found a significant association between inadequate hydration 
and elevated BMI and inadequate hydration and obesity, even after controlling 
for confounders. This relationship has not previously been shown on a popula-
tion level and suggests that water, an essential nutrient, may deserve greater 
focus in weight management research and clinical strategies.

INTRODUCTION
O
besity continues to be a prevalent, debilitating, and costly 
chronic disease in most high-income countries.1 The drivers of 
obesity are multifactorial and represent a major clinical chal-
lenge in both prevention and management.2,3 In addition to replacing 
sugar-sweetened beverages with water, improving overall hydration is a 
strategy commonly used to prevent overeating, with the goal of promot-
ing a healthy weight among patients.4-6 For example, counseling patients 
to first drink water when they have the urge to eat, as they may actually 
be thirsty rather than hungry, is a recommendation clinicians give patients 
and is advice readily found in lay media.
Water intake as a weight loss tool, however, is not an evidence-based 
recommendation. Recent studies have shown mixed results, likely because 
of limitations in the measurement of hunger and thirst, as well as the 
numerous social, cognitive, sensory, and logistical factors that influence 
eating and drinking behaviors.5 Some studies suggest that water intake 
may be a promising target for obesity prevention and treatment, whereas

other studies report an association between obesity 
and greater water intake.7,8
A recent systematic review reported contradictory 
findings between water intake and obesity among the 
6 cross-sectional studies investigated, with some stud-
ies even showing a direct relationship between water 
intake and obesity.8 The authors hypothesized that 
obese individuals may consume food with higher salt 
content, driving the need for increased water intake to 
balance the renal solute load.8 Although these cross-
sectional studies of water intake and obesity have 
shown mixed results, results from recent longitudinal 
studies and randomized controlled trials indicate the 
potential for water to prevent and treat obesity effec-
tively.4,9 Findings from 3 prospective cohort studies 
(the Nurses’ Health Study I and II, and the Health Pro-
fessionals Follow-Up Study) indicate that greater water 
intake is inversely associated with weight gain.10
Among these studies, water intake has been the 
outcome of interest.4,8-10 Urine osmolality, however, is a 
more effective measure of hydration than water intake 
alone, as it accounts for water and solutes acquired 
in food and other beverages.11 Urine osmolality also 
measures daily water intake more accurately because 
it is an objective laboratory measurement that is not 
subject to recall bias. In 2009, the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) added 
urine osmolality as a laboratory test for its sample. To 
date, no population-level studies have investigated the 
relationship between adequate hydration, as measured 
by urine osmolality, and obesity. The aim of this study 
was to use the NHANES to assess the relationship 
between urine osmolality as a marker for hydration and 
obesity (based on body mass index, BMI) among adults 
in the United States.
METHODS
The NHANES is a program of studies designed to 
assess the health and nutritional status of adults and 
children in the United States. This survey is unique in 
that it combines interviews and physical examinations. 
Data from the 2 most recent NHANES cohorts (2009 
to 2010 and 2011 to 2012) were used for all analyses.12 
Adults aged 18 to 64 years with complete medical 
examination data were included in the analysis. To 
make a collection of participants selected under the 
complex NHANES survey design representing the US 
noninstitutionalized civilian population, each sampled 
person is assigned a numerical sample weight. All anal-
yses were performed using appropriate complex survey 
weights with STATA 13.1 (StataCorp LP). The Univer-
sity of Michigan institutional review board determined 
this study to be not regulated.
The primary outcome of interest was BMI (kg/m2), 
which was used to further categorize individuals as 
obese (BMI ≥30) or not (BMI <30).13 Urine osmolality 
information collected at the medical examination was 
used to determine hydration status. Consistent with 
previous studies and recommendations, individuals 
with values of 800 mOsm/kg or greater were consid-
ered inadequately hydrated.11,14-16 Bivariate associations 
between hydration and covariates were performed using 
independent samples t test and Pearson χ2, as appro-
priate. Models were adjusted for known confounders 
including age, race/ethnicity, sex, and income-to-poverty 
ratio.17,18 To determine income-to-poverty ratio, partici-
pants were asked to report the total (annual) income for 
themselves and for other members of their family. Fam-
ily income was then divided by the poverty threshold, 
which is adjusted for family size and is updated annually 
for inflation. An income-to-poverty ratio less than 1 
indicates that the family is below the poverty threshold.
Linear and logistic regressions were performed 
with continuous BMI and obesity status (obese/not 
obese) as the outcomes, respectively. To determine 
whether associations between BMI and hydration sta-
tus changed with age, interactions between hydration 
status and age were investigated in both the linear and 
logistic regression models. All findings are reported 
with sampling weights applied, unless otherwise noted.
To ensure that results were not influenced by fac-
tors known to alter urine osmolality, a sensitivity anal-
ysis was performed on the final models. We identified 
individuals who had a known diagnosis of diabetes, 
who had an elevated glycohemoglobin level (6.5% or 
greater), or who were currently prescribed a diuretic 
and reestimated the final models excluding these cases.
Of note, hydration status is dependent on water 
intake via consumption of food and fluids, as well as 
on water production, which is influenced by physical 
activity among other factors, and they are intermediate 
in the proposed pathway linking BMI and hydration. 
Accordingly, we did not adjust for fluid intake or physi-
cal activity to avoid overadjustment in our models.
RESULTS
After combining data from the NHANES 2009-2010 
and 2011-2012 surveys, we had an unweighted sample 
size of 9,528 individuals (weighted n = 193.7 million) 
aged 18 to 64 years with complete medical examina-
tion data. Table 1 displays the demographic charac-
teristics of the sample. Approximately 50.8% were 
women, 64.5% were non-Hispanic white, their mean 
age was 41.1 years.
The mean urine osmolality was 631.4 mOsm/kg 
(SD = 236.2 mOsm/kg), with 32.6% inadequately

hydrated based on a urine osmolality of 800 mOsm/kg 
or greater. In bivariate analyses, hydration status was 
significantly associated with age, race/ethnicity, sex, 
income-to-poverty ratio, and BMI (Table 2).
In multivariable analyses, hydration status was 
significantly associated with BMI outcomes in both 
linear and logistic regression models (Table 3). Adults 
who were inadequately hydrated had a mean BMI of 
1.32 kg/m2 (95% CI, 0.85-1.79 kg/m2; P <.001) more 
than hydrated individuals, on average. The odds of 
being obese were 1.59 times higher for inadequately 
hydrated individuals compared with hydrated individu-
als (95% CI, 1.35-1.88; P <.001).
As expected, race/ethnicity, income-to-poverty 
ratio, and age were also significantly associated with 
BMI outcomes in adjusted models. Mexican Ameri-
cans and non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to be 
obese and have higher BMIs than non-Hispanic whites, 
whereas other races were less likely. Older adults also 
had higher BMIs and were more likely to be obese 
than younger adults. Individuals with higher income-
to-poverty ratios were significantly less likely to have 
higher BMIs and less likely to be obese than individu-
als with lower income-to-poverty ratios. No significant 
interactions were found between hydration status and 
age in either linear or logistic regressions.
In this sample, 1,536 individuals had known diabetes 
(n = 807), had an elevated glycohemo-
globin (n = 242), or were prescribed a 
diuretic (n = 487). A sensitivity analysis 
that used models excluding this sub-
set of individuals resulted in findings 
similar to those of the models above. 
Inadequately hydrated individuals had 
higher mean BMIs (1.44 kg/m2; 95% 
CI, 1.02-1.87 kg/m2; P <.001) and were 
also more likely to be obese (adjusted 
odds ratio = 1.67; 95% CI, 1.40-1.99; 
P <.001) than adequately hydrated 
individuals. Race, age, and income-
to-poverty ratio effects on BMI and 
obesity were also similar in models 
excluding this group (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative, recent 
sample of US adults, inadequate hydra-
tion was associated with higher BMI 
and obesity among adults aged 18 to 
64 years. Our study highlights a novel 
relationship between hydration and 
BMI that may have important clinical 
implications.

Although causality and directionality cannot be 
established in our cross-sectional study, our findings 
suggest that additional investigation is warranted to 
examine the relationship between inadequate hydra-
tion and weight status. Inadequate hydration has been 
associated with worsened mental, physical, and emo-
tional health.19 Performance in tasks that require atten-
tion, psychomotor, and immediate memory skills may 
be affected.20,21 Self-ratings of alertness and ability to 
concentrate have been shown to decline while ratings 
of tiredness and headache increase progressively when 
fluid intake is restricted to induce deficits of even as 
little as 1% to 2%.21 Poor mood, headaches, and renal 
dysfunction, as well as constipation, have also been 
associated with inadequate hydration.11,22
Though hydration is discussed in the context of 
weight management by clinicians and lay media, rec-
ommendations to remain adequately hydrated are not 
included in generally accepted guidelines as a treat-
ment in weight management.23 Our findings suggest 
that adequate hydration may play a role in weight and 
prompt further discussion regarding adequate hydra-
tion during weight management counseling. If obese 
individuals are more likely to maintain poor hydration 
or are eating when they are actually thirsty, additional 
education could be provided regarding differentiating 
between cues of hunger and thirst.
Our findings also suggest that individuals with 
higher BMIs may behave in ways that lead them to be 
inadequately hydrated. Obese individuals have higher 
water needs than nonobese individuals, because water 
needs depend upon metabolic rate, body surface area, 
and body weight.24 Water turnover rates increase with 
BMI based on higher energy requirements, 
greater food consumption, and higher 
metabolic production.24,25 The current 
guidelines for water intake according to 
the Institute of Medicine adequate intake 
standards (3.7 L/d for adult men and 2.7 
L/d for adult women) are calculated inde-
pendently of obesity status.25 In contrast, 
several methods of estimating fluid needs 
used in clinical settings are weight depen-
dent, with estimated water requirements 
of healthy community-dwelling individuals 
to be between 40 and 50 mL/kg a day.26 
Using this estimate, the water require-
ments for a 5-foot, 10-inch man who weighs 
160 pounds (healthy weight) and a 5-foot, 
10-inch man weighing 210 pounds (obese) 
would differ by more than 1 L. Clinicians 
are likely not aware of this greater water 
requirement among those with higher BMIs 
and thus may not provide adequate counsel-
ing to meet this requirement.
Although inadequate intake of water among obese 
adults may explain the observed findings, differential 
consumption of food with high water content may 
also contribute to the relationship between inadequate 
hydration and elevated BMI. Foods high in water or 
dietary fiber typically have fewer calories per gram 
and are thus lower in calorie density, whereas foods 
higher in fat are generally higher in calorie density.23 
Although increasing fruits and vegetables is often rec-
ommended as part of a healthy weight management 
strategy and is not thought to be a stand-alone inter-
vention for obesity,27 obese individuals and those with 
higher BMIs and increased hydration requirements 
may benefit from more guidance related to achieving 
adequate hydration through food and fluids.
Our study has several notable strengths, including 
the analysis of a nationally representative sample and 
the use of objective laboratory values of hydration and 
anthropometric measurements. Our findings, however, 
should be considered in the context of specific limita-
tions. First, these data are cross-sectional and cannot 
be used to infer causation. Second, though urine osmo-
lality is regarded as an excellent measure of hydration, 
it is possible that the 1-time reading available in the 
NHANES does not represent individuals’ usual level of 
hydration.7 Studies have indicated, however, that this 
value is an adequate and accurate measure of hydra-
tion on a population level.11,28,29 Third, findings from 
our nationally representative sample of adults aged 18 
to 64 years may not generalize to other age-groups 
(children, seniors) or to individuals in non–community-
dwelling settings. Finally, because hydration is influ-

enced by multiple factors, broad recommendations 
on methods to improve hydration may be difficult to 
make. This association between inadequate hydration 
and obesity, after controlling for confounding vari-
ables, has not previously been shown on a population 
level and suggests that water, an essential nutrient, may 
deserve greater focus in weight management research 
and clinical strategies.
