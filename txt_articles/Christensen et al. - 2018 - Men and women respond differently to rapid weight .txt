 Funding information
Funding was received from the EU 7th
Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)
under grant agreement no. 312057, The
National Health and Medical Research Council
- EU Collaborative Grant, AUS, The NZ Health
Research Council (14/191) and the UoA
Faculty Research Development Fund. The
Cambridge Weight Plan, UK kindly donated all
products for the 8-week Low-Energy Diet
period.
Materials and methods: All participants followed a LED (3.4 MJ/810 kcal/daily) for 8 weeks
(Cambridge Weight Plan). Participants were recruited from 8 sites in Europe, Australia and
New Zealand. Those eligible for inclusion were overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) individuals with
pre-diabetes according to ADA-criteria. Outcomes of interest included changes in insulin resis-
tance, fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and metabolic syndrome Z-score.
Results: In total, 2224 individuals (1504 women, 720 men) attended the baseline visit and 2020
(90.8%) completed the follow-up visit. Following the LED, weight loss was 16% greater in men
than in women (11.8% vs 10.3%, respectively) but improvements in insulin resistance were
similar. HOMA-IR decreased by 1.50 � 0.15 in men and by 1.35 � 0.15 in women (ns). After
adjusting for differences in weight loss, men had larger reductions in metabolic syndrome
Z-score, C-peptide, FM and heart rate, while women had larger reductions in HDL cholesterol,
FFM, hip circumference and pulse pressure. Following the LED, 35% of participants of both
genders had reverted to normo-glycaemia.
Conclusions: An 8-week LED induced different effects in women than in men. These findings
are clinically important and suggest gender-specific changes after weight loss. It is important to
investigate whether the greater decreases in FFM, hip circumference and HDL cholesterol in
women after rapid weight loss compromise weight loss maintenance and future cardiovascular
health.

INTRODUCTION
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the fastest growing chronic diseases
worldwide.1 We are aware of the major risk factors, including over-
weight or obesity, and know that achieving weight loss “prevents dia-
betes” in the sense that onset of new cases is delayed. The most
recent paper exploring the dose-response effect of weight loss shows
that more than 4.3% weight loss is needed to prevent diabetes, for
3 years, in Japanese men.2 The PREVIEW intervention study
(PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle Intervention and population
studies in Europe and around the World; www.previewstudy.com) is,
to date, the largest, multinational study that aims to prevent type
2 diabetes in overweight individuals with pre-diabetes. Diet and phys-
ical activity are utilized, with changes being reinforced by behavior
modification techniques.3 The study is an ongoing 3-year multicentre,
2-by-2 factorial, randomized controlled trial, in which eligible adult
participants initially followed an 8-week low-energy diet (LED). The
aim was to induce weight loss of at least 8%, in order to qualify for
inclusion in the randomized intervention where the focus is on long-
term weight loss maintenance.4
The majority of individuals who use weight loss programmes,
including bariatric surgery, are women.5,6 Investigating whether out-
comes differ between men and women is import in developing
gender-specific treatment programmes, if required.6–12 Differences in
outcome after weight loss have been reported previously, with men
commonly losing more body weight and fat than women.13 This dif-
ference is mainly explained by the concept of the LED, in which a
fixed daily energy intake is provided to both genders, despite men and
women having significantly different energy requirements because
men characteristically have a greater body mass. Notably, however,
men may mobilize more intra-abdominal fat than women during
weight loss, whereas women may lose more subcutaneous fat.14,15
The greater reduction in intra-abdominal fat in men is accompanied by
a more pronounced improvement in metabolic risk profile. Therefore,
greater improvement in terms of risk factors in men is not only related
to a greater negative energy balance, but also to a gender-specific
effect.16,17
Of interest are the differences in glycaemia between overweight
men and women. The prevalence of pre-diabetes has been reported
to be significantly higher in men than in women.18 Impaired fasting
glucose (IFG), which is indicative of hepatic insulin resistance (IR), is
also more common in men, typically 1.5-3 times higher.19 Conversely,
the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), which is indicative
of skeletal muscle IR, has been reported to be higher in women than
in men in almost all age groups.16
In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of an 8-week LED-
induced weight loss on metabolic outcomes in a large group of men
and women. The study included data from adult participants aged
25-70 years who were enrolled in the PREVIEW diabetes prevention
study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Adult participants were recruited to the PREVIEW study between
August 2013 and March 2015 from eight intervention sites. The
study sites were University of Copenhagen (UCPH), Denmark; Uni-
versity
of
Helsinki
(HEL),
Finland;
University
of
Nottingham
CHRISTENSEN ET AL.
2841
 (UNOTT), UK; University of Maastricht (UM), The Netherlands; Uni-
versity of Navarra (UNAV), Spain; Medical University of Sofia (MU),
Bulgaria; University of Auckland (UOA), New Zealand and University
of Sydney (UNSYD), Australia. Overweight men and women with
pre-diabetes were eligible for inclusion. Participants were recruited
via advertisements in newspapers and newsletters, radio and televi-
sion
advertisements/interviews
and
by
contacting
primary
and
occupational
health
care
providers.
Interested
individuals
were
pre-screened for eligibility by using the Finnish Diabetes Risk
Score,20,21 as well as the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed online
(Appendix S1). Potentially eligible participants were then invited to
an information meeting, where written and oral information was pro-
vided. Before continuing to the laboratory screening session, written
informed consent was obtained. Criteria for assessing pre-diabetes
were those recommended by the American Diabetes Association
(ADA),22 namely, fasting venous plasma glucose concentration of
5.6-6.9 mmol/L (IFG) and/or venous plasma glucose concentration of
7.8-11.0 mmol/L at 2 hours (IGT) after oral administration of 75 g
glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), with fasting
plasma glucose (FPG) less than 7.0 mmol/L. Haemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) was not used to determine eligibility. Other inclusion criteria
for adult participants were age of 25-70 years and body mass index
(BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2. Prior to screening and recruitment, the study pro-
tocol was approved by the Ethical Committees of participating
countries.
2.1
| Interventions
The PREVIEW study comprises 2 intervention phases. Phase 1 is an
8-week, weight-loss phase using a formula LED (3.4 MJ/d) intended
to induce weight loss of ≥8% to qualify for the next phase. Phase 2 is
an ongoing 148-week randomized lifestyle intervention that focuses
on diet, physical activity and behaviour modification for maintenance
of weight loss. The LED was implemented by using a range of formula
products of the Cambridge Weight Plan (Northants, UK). All interven-
tion sites used the standard assortment from the Cambridge Weight
Plan available in the UK to ensure that the nutritional content of
sachets was identical. The sachets, which included soups, shakes and
porridges, were provided to participants without charge. Participants
were instructed to consume 4 sachets (4 × 40 g) per day. Of these,
3 sachets were to be dissolved in milk (3 × 250 mL low fat milk, total
750 mL/d) and 1 sachet in 250 mL of water. The fat content of the
milk
was
≤0.5
g/100 mL
and
the
energy
content
≤170 kJ
(40 kcal)/100 mL. Participants with a BMI > 40 kg/m2 were encour-
aged to dissolve all 4 sachets in milk to increase intake of protein. In
total, the LED provided an estimated 3.4 MJ/d (810 kcal/d), �85 g of
protein, �5 g of essential fatty acids and the daily requirement for
vitamins and minerals.23,24
The macronutrient composition of the LED was as follows: 43.7
total energy % from protein, 41.2 total energy % from carbohydrate
and 15.1 total energy % from fat. The fiber content of the LED was
relatively low at 13.3 g/d. To avoid gastrointestinal side effects, psyl-
lium fiber was recommended to participants, as well as sufficient
water to remain hydrated. In addition to the sachets and milk, partici-
pants were permitted to consume 375 g of low-starch vegetables
such as tomatoes, cucumber and lettuce per day. Replacement of
these additional foods by alternatives was not permitted. During the
LED intervention, participants attended group visits at the interven-
tion sites at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8, where they were guided in the use of
the LED by experienced dietitians or counsellors. Further information
about the LED is available online (Appendix S2).
2.2
| Outcomes
All outcomes were measured before and after the 8-week interven-
tion at clinical investigation days (CIDs) which participants attended in
a fasting state (10-12 hours). The main outcome of interest in this
analysis was change in insulin resistance (IR), calculated by the
Homeostasis Model for Assessment (HOMA). The equation used was
(FSI * FPG)/22.5, where FSI is fasting serum insulin concentration
(mU/L) and FPG is fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L).25 Other outcomes
included changes in FPG, HbA1c, fasting insulin, C-peptide, total cho-
lesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipo-
protein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), C-reactive protein (CRP)
and liver enzymes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate ami-
notransferase (AST).
Blood samples were drawn from the antecubital vein. Serum and
whole blood samples were initially stored at −80 �C at the individual
intervention sites, after which they were transported to a laboratory
in Finland for central batch analyses (National Institute for Health and
Welfare, Helsinki). The laboratory (T077) is accredited by the Finnish
Accreditation Service and fulfils requirements of the standard SFS-EN
ISO/IEC 17025:2005. The scope of accreditation covers all analyses
with the exception of those for AST and C-Peptide. Laboratory mea-
surements were performed on Architect ci8200 integrated system
(Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois). Other outcomes were
change in body weight, measured in a fasting state, with an empty
bladder, wearing only underwear (or other light clothing). Two mea-
surements were taken to the nearest 0.1 kg and the mean was calcu-
lated. For measurement of height, participants were required to
remove shoes, and stand with their heels, buttocks and upper part of
the back in contact with a wall-mounted stadiometer. Height was
measured to the nearest 0.5 cm and the mean of 2 measurements
was calculated. Waist, hip and thigh circumference were measured to
the nearest 0.5 cm with a non-stretch tape, with the participant stand-
ing. Two measurements were recorded and the mean was calculated.
Waist circumference (WC) was measured midway between the bot-
tom of the rib cage (last floating rib) and the top of the iliac crest, at
the end of expiration. Hip circumference was measured at the widest
point between the hips and buttocks, following the same procedure
as that for waist measurement. Mid-thigh circumference was mea-
sured on the right side of the body, with the measuring tape placed
horizontally around the thigh midway between the midpoint of the
inguinal crease and the proximal border of the patella.
Measurements of body composition were performed by different
methods at the different intervention sites (Appendix S3). Fertile
women were tested for pregnancy before DXA. Outcomes of interest
were fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), bone mineral content (BMC)
and bone mineral density (BMD).

CHRISTENSEN ET AL.
 Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and heart rate
were measured using a validated automatic device on the right arm
after 5-10 minutes in a resting position. Measurements were per-
formed 3 times with a 1-minute rest between each recording and the
mean value was recorded. Pulse pressure was calculated using the for-
mula SBP minus DBP. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated
using the formula 0.42 × SBP + 0.58 × DBP.26
Metabolic syndrome (MS) was evaluated using an MS Z-score,
which is a continuous score of the 5 MS variables, as reported previ-
ously.27 Gender-specific Z-scores were used to account for variations
in criterion between men and women. The equations used were:
MS Z-score, ([50-HDL]/14.1) + ([TG-150]/81.0) + ([FPG-100]/11.3) +
([WC-88]/9.0) + ([MAP-100]/9.1) for women, and Z-score, ([40-
HDL]/9.0) + ([TG-150]/81.0) + ([FPG-100]/11.3) + ([WC-102]/7.7) +
([MAP-100]/9.1) for men.27
At all visits to the intervention sites, participants were asked
whether they had experienced adverse events (AEs). Any reported AE
was noted on a related form that captured onset, end, intensity, cau-
sality, action taken and outcome of the AE.
2.3
| Statistical methods
Descriptive characteristics at CID1 and CID2 are summarized as mean
� SD. Differences between men and women were analysed using a
linear mixed model, including intervention site as random effect. The
estimate of mean difference at baseline is presented as mean � SEM.
All analyses were carried out as complete-case analyses, that is, data
from all participants who attended both the baseline visit (CID1) and
the visit at Week 8 (CID2), independent of the amount of weight loss.
Count data, such as number of participants who dropped out or
achieved a successful weight loss were analysed for group differences
by simple 2 × 2 contingency tables and Chi-square. For continuous
outcomes,
the
mean
gender
difference
was
estimated
using
ANCOVA-type linear mixed models, adjusting for fixed effects of
baseline and age, and including centres as random effects. As the
weight loss intervention provided 3.4 MJ/d (810 kcal/d), we antici-
pated that men would experience a larger energy deficit than women
during the intervention and, therefore, would lose more weight. To
adjust for weight loss difference between men and women, the same
ANCOVA-type linear model was applied for all outcome variables,
while adjusting for weight loss percentage (%) as well. All statistical
analyses and calculations were performed with the statistical program
R version 3.3.2 and RStudio version 0.98.1028. A P-value of <0.05
was considered significant.

RESULTS
The flow of participants is shown in Figure 1. A total of 2224 individ-
uals (1504 women, 720 men) participated in the baseline visit (CID1)
and began the LED phase. The majority of participants described
themselves as Caucasian (1.949, 87.6%) and the remainder were Poly-
nesian (92, 4.1%), Asian (59, 2.7%), Hispanic (44, 2.0%) or Black
(38, 1.7%). A total of 42 individuals (1.9%) were classified as “other”
and most were of mixed origin. On average, the age of included
individuals was 51.6 � 11.6 years, body weight was 100.1 � 21.4 kg,
BMI was 35.4 � 6.6 kg/m2, HOMA-IR was 3.75 � 2.43 and FPG was
6.2 � 0.7 mmol/L. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Changes after the LED are shown in Table 2. A total of 2020 par-
ticipants attended the CID2 visit, with a dropout rate during the
8 weeks of 9.2% (204 participants; 152 women, 52 men). The propor-
tion of dropouts varied among centres (UCPH, 2.5%; HEL, 5.8%; UM,
7.4%; UNAV, 9.0%; UNSYD, 10.1%; MU, 12.1%; UOA, 12.7%;
UNOTT, 14.4%). Proportionally, more women (10.1%) than men
(7.2%) dropped out, leaving a risk difference of −2.9% points (95%
confidence interval [CI], −0.5% to −5.6% points; P = 0.01). Among
participants who began the LED phase, 1857 (83.5%) achieved the
target of ≥8% weight loss at 8 weeks. Fewer women (82%) than men
(86.5%) achieved target weight loss (difference of 4.5% points; 95%
CI, 1.4-7.7% points; P = .02).
The mean LED weight loss (�SEM) in all participants was
10.7 � 0.4 kg (10.8%; P < 0.001), with women losing 16% less weight
than men (10.2 � 0.4 kg [10.3%] vs 11.8 � 0.5 kg [11.8%], respec-
tively; P < .001). On average, HOMA-IR decreased by 1.42 � 0.15
units (P < 0.001) in all participants and was similar between women
and men (1.35 � 0.15 vs 1.50 � 0.15, respectively; P, ns). The overall
change in metabolic syndrome Z-score was −2.5 � 0.2 (P < 0.001),
but the improvement was less in women than in men (−2.1 � 0.2 vs
−3.4 � 0.2, respectively), with a mean difference of −1.3 � 0.1
(P < 0.001). The difference remained highly significant after adjusting
for differences in weight loss (%) (P < 0.001).
Of the 2224 participants who completed the baseline visit, 1429
(64.3%)
had
isolated
IFG,
283
(12.7%)
had
isolated
IGT
and
512 (23.0%) had both IFG and IGT at the screening visit. Following
weight loss as the result of the 8-week LED, 694 participants (35.8%)
had reverted to normo-glycaemia based on FPG alone. This number
increased to 40.2% among participants who met the target weight
loss (ie, ≥8% of initial body weight).
Following the LED, FFM decreased more in women than in men
(3.2 � 0.4
kg
vs
1.9 � 0.4
kg,
respectively
[mean
difference,
1.3 � 0.2 kg; P < 0.001]). Conversely, FM decreased less in women
than in men (7.1 � 0.4 kg vs 9.3 � 0.4 kg, respectively [mean differ-
ence, −2.2 � 0.2 kg; P < 0.001). For both outcomes, the difference in
changes between women and men remained highly significant after
adjusting for weight loss (%).
A separate analysis of changes in anthropometry, HOMA-IR and
blood markers in female participants in different age groups is shown
in Appendix S4. The younger age group (<45.9 years) experienced sta-
tistically different changes in HOMA-IR, HbA1c, insulin, HDL choles-
terol, ALT, thigh circumference, BMC, BMD and heart rate compared
to the two older age groups (46-54 years and > 55 years). Between
the older age groups, changes in HbA1c, ALT, thigh circumference and
BMD
were
statistically
significantly
different
after
the
LED
weight loss.
During the LED weight loss period, 961 AEs were reported across
all sites. Of these, 10 events were reported as serious adverse events
(SAEs). However, all SAEs were evaluated as unlikely to be related, or
unrelated, to the study intervention and the LED weight loss. Women
reported significantly more adverse events than men (Table 3). The
CHRISTENSEN ET AL.
2843
 main AEs were constipation, cold/influenza, muscular weakness
and pain.

DISCUSSION
In this worldwide intervention study, participants lost an average of
11% body weight and showed significant improvements in insulin
resistance (change in HOMA-IR, −1.4; P < 0.001) after an 8-week
LED. There were differences in other metabolic outcomes accord-
ing to gender; men appeared to benefit more than women. Men lost
significantly more body weight than women, and had larger
reductions in metabolic syndrome Z-score, C-peptide, FM and heart
rate, even after adjusting for differences in weight loss (%). In con-
trast, women had larger reductions in HDL cholesterol, hip circum-
ference, BMC, FFM and pulse pressure than men, again after
adjustment for differences in weight loss (%). As declines in HDL
cholesterol, BMC and lean mass are generally not supportive of
long-term health, it is of general interest to determine whether
rapid weight loss with a LED compromises the health of some
women. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate whether the
long-term effects of rapid weight loss are indeed more beneficial
for men than for women with regard to prevention of both type-2
diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

 Previous studies have reported that differences in metabolic out-
come according to gender occur because men mobilize more intra-
abdominal fat than women during weight loss, and that this is accom-
panied by a more pronounced improvement in the metabolic risk pro-
file.12,14,15 In the present study, we found important differences when
comparing outcomes between women and men, both before and after
adjusting for differences in weight loss (%). This suggests intrinsic dif-
ferences in how men and women adapt to dietary energy deficits.
Following LED weight loss, the loss of FFM was, on average, 25%
of the total weight loss. Changes in FFM of this magnitude are consid-
ered normal during LED weight loss.28,29 Interestingly, however,
women lost twice as much FFM as men (31.4% vs 16.1%, respec-
tively), which is striking, as men had a larger energy deficit during the
LED phase. It would be expected that men would have a larger
requirement for dietary protein, as their FFM was much larger than
that of women at baseline. Using the most recent Joint FAO/WHO/
UNU Expert Consultation on Human Energy Requirements,30 it is pos-
sible to estimate the daily energy requirement of an average male
PREVIEW participant (body weight, 109.4 kg) with a low daily physical
activity level (PAL, 1.45) as 13 MJ (3086 kcal). In comparison, a female
participant (body weight, 95.6 kg) with a similar activity level would
have a daily energy requirement of approximately only 10 MJ
(2353 kcal). However, despite this large difference in energy require-
ment, men managed to preserve more FFM during the LED than
women. Looking at this from a compliance perspective, the daily pro-
vision of 3.4 MJ/d with the LED would leave men with an energy defi-
cit of 9.6 MJ/d and women with a deficit of 6.5 MJ/d. After 8 weeks,
these energy deficits should yield a weight loss of 18.3 kg for men
and of 12.4 kg for women according to Westerterp et al.32 Consider-
ing the actual weight loss achieved, 11.8 kg for men and 10.2 kg for
women, there is reason to believe that women were closer to their
theoretically achievable weight loss target (82.2%) than men (64.5%).
If we then evaluate and make the reverse calculation of achieved
weight loss, it appears that the mean energy intake in men must have
been 6.1 MJ/d and the mean energy intake in women must have been
4.55 MJ/d. This suggests that women were more compliant with the
diet than men. Similar observations were made by Camps SG et al.31 It
would be interesting to investigate differences between men and
women in compliance with and adaptation to the LED phase as it may
help explain the differences found in this analysis.
Physical activity (PA) and exercise training are associated with
numerous health benefits.33 In the PREVIEW study, we did not mea-
sure the level of physical activity during or immediately after the LED
weight-loss phase. Differences in physical activity level between par-
ticipants could have impacted some results presented in this paper;
however, the strict inclusion criterion (absence of high PA) led to a
narrower between-person variance in PA, which decreased the likeli-
hood that one could find an association between PA, weight loss and
the related outcomes. The included participants were, more or less,
physically inactive and no guidance concerning PA was given during
the LED phase. Although we do not have direct evidence, it is unlikely
that any major changes in PA occurred during the LED phase.
In the PREVIEW study, different equipment was used to measure
body composition at the different intervention sites (Appendix S3);
however, the same equipment was always used to measure a given

 participant. There are many body composition methods available to
estimate different body compartments.34,35 The more practical and
acceptable methods that are frequently used to estimate body com-
position include Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioim-
pedance analysis (BIA), which were primarily used in the current
study. The validity of DXA and BIA has been debated previously; their
accuracy can vary according to age, adiposity, etc.34,36 In this study,
using different equipment at the various sites may have introduced
some variability in the data. However, as the same equipment was
always used for a given participant, and as adjustments were made for
the site in the analyses, we believe that we have limited the bias to
the greatest extent possible while we acknowledge that not using the
same equipment across all sites is a weakness of the trial.
Additionally, 87.6% of the study participants described them-
selves as Caucasian and the remaining participants were Polynesians
Asian, Hispanic, Black or of mixed origin. Therefore, the ethnic diver-
sity of PREVIEW participants does not allow generalization of the
results to all ethnic groups but primarily to Caucasians.

 Drop-out rates during the LED were generally low but varied
across centres, from 2.5% to 14.4%. The lower drop-out rate in men
might be explained by the greater, early success experienced by men
using the LED. There can be many reasons for the difference in drop-
out rates across sites. At some sites, participants were not as familiar
with using formula LEDs for weight loss as those at other sites; thus,
cultural and social challenges varied. Differences in compliance and
efficacy of the LED in different settings have also been reported in an
earlier large-scale study.37
As outlined in this discussion, many aspects of the study could
have contributed to the gender-specific effects that we found.
Regional fat distribution is indeed different between men and women
and, as described earlier, men may mobilize more intra-abdominal fat
than women, whereas women may lose more subcutaneous fat during
weight loss.14,15 However, our aim with these analyses was not to
attempt to disentangle the various contributors to gender-specific
effects, that is, gender-specific hormones, behaviour and compliance
during the LED. Our aim was to assess gender-specific effects as a
whole and future analysis of our data could explore what constitutes
these gender-specific effects.
In the separate analysis investigating differences between age
groups within the female population, we found several statistically sig-
nificant findings. Whether these findings are clinically important or
simply statistically significant findings is difficult to interpret.
Generally, weight loss is known to be associated with improve-
ments
in
liver
transaminases
once
weight
stability
has
been
achieved.38 However, our current study is consistent with the existing
literature in showing that transient mild increases in liver enzymes can
be observed in some individuals immediately after an LED period.39
Increments were significantly larger in women than in men. It has
been reported in previous studies that values return to normal within
a few weeks.24 The consequences of the changes are believed to be
benign if the enzyme elevation is transient.39
An important strength of our study is the large sample size and
the wide age span, in all sites in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In
addition, criteria for identifying pre-diabetes were consistent from site
to site as ADA criteria (IFG, 5.6-6.9 mmol/L)22,40 were used. The range
for identifying IFG according to the World Health Organization is nar-
rower (6.1-6.9 mmol/L). 40 However, in the present study, following
LED weight loss, more than 35% of the men and women with IFG at
screening reverted to normo-glycaemia. A recent systematic review
and meta-analysis41 concluded that the risk of cardiovascular disease
was increased in individuals with FPG as low as 5.6 mmol/L. Concern-
ing participants with IFG, according to WHO criteria (> 6.1 mmol/L;
n = 790), 442 participants (55.9%) were no longer classified with pre-
diabetes after LED weight loss. This number increased to 62.6%, when
including only those participants with successful weight loss (ie, ≥8%
of initial body weight).
The results presented in this analysis provide data only on short-
term changes. Indeed, maintaining weight loss and the accompanying
improvements is challenging.42,43 Whether PREVIEW participants are
able to maintain the weight loss and achieved metabolic responses,
and whether differences between genders persist in the long term will
be apparent once the trial is completed. However, the 8-week LED in
individuals with pre-diabetes did result in the initial 10% weight loss
needed to achieve major metabolic improvement in the first phase of
a diabetes prevention programme.
In conclusion, an 8-week LED was accompanied by significant
improvements in anthropometry, blood pressure and metabolic pro-
file
in
overweight
women
and
men
with
pre-diabetes.

CHRISTENSEN ET AL.
 HOMA-IR improved in all participants, regardless of gender, men
lost significantly more body weight than women and had larger
reductions in metabolic syndrome Z-score, C-peptide and FM, even
after adjusting for differences in weight loss (%). In contrast, women
had larger reductions in HDL cholesterol, FFM and BMC that could
be considered undesirable. These findings are clinically important
and suggest gender-specific differences between men and women
after weight loss. It is of importance to investigate whether the
greater reduction in FFM, BMC, hip circumference and HDL choles-
terol in women after rapid weight loss is indeed beneficial or,
rather, might compromise weight loss maintenance and future opti-
mal/good cardiovascular health.
