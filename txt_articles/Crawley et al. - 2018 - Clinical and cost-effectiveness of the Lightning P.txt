AbstrAct
Objective Investigate the effectiveness and cost-
effectiveness of the Lightning Process (LP) in addition to 
specialist medical care (SMC) compared with SMC alone, 
for children with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic 
encephalitis (ME).
Design Pragmatic randomised controlled open trial. 
Participants were randomly assigned to SMC or SMC+LP. 
Randomisation was minimised by age and gender.
setting Specialist paediatric CFS/ME service.
Patients 12–18 year olds with mild/moderate CFS/ME.
Main outcome measures The primary outcome 
was the the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey Physical 
Function Subscale (SF-36-PFS) at 6 months. Secondary 
outcomes included pain, anxiety, depression, school 
attendance and cost-effectiveness from a health service 
perspective at 3, 6 and 12 months.
results We recruited 100 participants, of whom 51 
were randomised to SMC+LP. Data from 81 participants 
were analysed at 6 months. Physical function (SF-36-
PFS) was better in those allocated SMC+LP (adjusted 
difference in means 12.5(95% CI 4.5 to 20.5), p=0.003) 
and this improved further at 12 months (15.1 (5.8 
to 24.4), p=0.002). At 6 months, fatigue and anxiety 
were reduced, and at 12 months, fatigue, anxiety, 
depression and school attendance had improved in the 
SMC+LP arm. Results were similar following multiple 
imputation. SMC+LP was probably more cost-effective in 
the multiple imputation dataset (difference in means in 
net monetary benefit at 12 months £1474(95% CI £111 
to £2836), p=0.034) but not for complete cases. 
conclusion The LP is effective and is probably cost-
effective when provided in addition to SMC for mild/
moderately affected adolescents with CFS/ME.
trial registration number ISRCTN81456207.
IntrODuctIOn
Paediatric chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or 
myalgic encephalitis (ME) affects 0.57%–2.4%1–4of 
children and is disabling with important impacts on 
mood5 6 school attendance4 7 8 quality of life9 and 
family functioning.10 It is defined as generalised 
fatigue causing disruption of daily life, persisting 
after routine tests and investigations have failed to 
identify an obvious underlying cause.11 A minimum 
of 3 
months of fatigue is required before the 
diagnosis can be made.12 On average, those affected 
miss a year of school overall and half are bedbound 
at some stage.13 14
There is a limited evidence base for treatment of 
paediatric CFS/ME.12 15 16 Three randomised trials 
have shown that cognitive–behavioural therapy 
(CBT) delivered individually,17 with biofeed-
back,18 or via the internet19 is effective at 6 
months 
compared with waiting list or usual medical care. 
All three studies reported improvements in fatigue, 
school attendance and a reduction in disability. 
Family-focused CBT appears to be as effective as 
psychoeducation in terms of school attendance at 
6 
months and recovery at 24 
months.20 21 However, 
even with effective treatment, over a third of chil-
dren19 20 have not recovered at 6 and 12 
months22 
and 21%21 to 36%22 are still unwell (eg, attending 
school <70% of the time) at 24 months. There 
is therefore an urgent need to find more effective 
treatments.

What is already known on this topic?
 
► Paediatric chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/
myalgic encephalitis (ME) is relatively common 
with a negative impact on school, mood and 
quality of life.
 
► Even with effective treatment, a significant 
number of children have not recovered at 6 
months.
 
► The Lightning Process (LP) is used by children 
with CFS/ME in the UK but with no evidence of 
effectiveness.
What this study adds?
 
► At 6 months, children who received LP in 
addition to SMC had better physical function, 
fatigue and less anxiety.
 
► At 12 months, children who received LP in 
addition to SMC had better fatigue, anxiety, 
depression and school attendance.
 
► Adding LP is probably cost-effective but not all 
children wish to take part.

Adolescent health
The Lightning Process (LP) is developed from osteopathy, 
life coaching and neurolinguistic programming and is used for 
a variety of conditions including CFS/ME. Clients read infor-
mation, attend three group sessions and then receive follow-up 
phone calls.23 More than 250 children use LP for their CFS/ME 
each year in the UK (at a cost of ~£620 each), but there are 
no reported studies investigating its effectiveness, cost-effective-
ness or side effects. LP is not available in the National Health 
Serivce (NHS). Having shown that recruitment, randomisation 
and data collection were feasible and acceptable,24 we conducted 
a randomised trial to investigate the effectiveness and cost-ef-
fectiveness of LP in addition to specialist medical care (SMC), 
compared with SMC alone, for children with CFS/ME.
MethODs
study design and participants
A detailed description of the study protocol has been reported.25 
Between September 2010 and April 2013, we recruited partici-
pants after clinical assessment by the Bath/Bristol paediatric CFS/
ME service, a large regional and national NHS specialist service. 
Children were diagnosed with CFS/ME after a thorough assess-
ment which included screening for other disorders associated 
with fatigue.12 Baseline data were collected at this assessment. 
Children were eligible if they had CFS/ME, were aged 12–18, 
spoke English and were not housebound.
randomisation and masking
Allocation to trial arms was in equal proportions using minimis-
ation by age (12–15/16–18 years) and gender, weighted towards 
minimising the imbalance in trial arms with probability 0.8. 
Allocation was concealed using a telephone-based interactive 
voice response system, created and maintained by the Bristol 
Randomised Trials Collaboration, and accessed by the recruiting 
researcher. This was an open study: the randomised intervention 
was conveyed during the recruitment interview so that partici-
pants, parents, therapists and researchers were aware of treat-
ment allocation. Data analyses were conducted using masked 
treatment codes.
Interventions
All participants were offered SMC12 which focused on 
improving sleep and using activity management to establish a 
baseline level of activity (school, exercise and social activity) 
which is then gradually increased. Sessions were delivered 
by a range of trained and supervised professionals including 
doctors, psychologists, physiotherapists and occupational 
therapists in family-based rehabilitation consultations. 
Follow-up sessions were either face to face or by telephone. 
The number and timing of the sessions were agreed with the 
family depending on each adolescent’s needs and goals. Those 
with significant anxiety or low mood were offered additional 
CBT. Participants could choose to use physiotherapist-deliv-
ered graded exercise therapy, which provides detailed advice 
about exercise and focuses on an exercise programme rather 
than other activities.
Participants randomised to SMC+LP were asked to read 
information about LP and complete an assessment form 
with their parents to identify their goals and describe what 
they had learnt. They then had a telephone call with an LP 
practitioner (online supplementary appendix 1) to discuss 
attending an LP course consisting of three 4-hour sessions on 
consecutive days run with groups of two to five young people. 
Each had a theory session with taught elements on the stress 
response, how the mind and body interact, and how thought 
processes can be either helpful or negative. This was followed 
by group discussion where the language used was discussed 
and in some cases challenged, and where participants were 
encouraged to think about what they could take responsi-
bility for and change. In the practical session, participants 
identified a goal they wished to achieve (such as standing for 
longer) and were given different cognitive (thinking) strate-
gies before and while the goal was attempted. They were also 
asked to identify a goal to attempt at home. After the course, 
young people were offered at least two follow-up phone calls 
with an LP practitioner.
LP practitioners have completed a diploma through the Phil 
Parker Training Institute in Neurolinguistic Programming, Life 
Coaching and Clinical Hypnotherapy. This diploma is examined 
through written and practical examinations and is accredited by 
the British Institute of Hypnotherapy and NLP
. Following the 
diploma, LP practitioners undertake a further course to learn the 
tools and delivery required for the LP after which they must pass 
both a practical and written examination. Practitioners under-
take supervision and continuous professional development in 
order to further develop their skills and knowledge. They are 
regulated by the register of LP practitioners, adhere to a code 
of conduct and there is a Professional Conduct Committee that 
oversees complaints and professional practice issues.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the the 36-Item Short-Form Health 
Survey Physical Function Subscale (SF-36-PFS)26 analysed as a 
continuous variable collected at 6-month post-randomisation. 
Secondary outcomes were the SF-36-PFS at 3 and 12 months, 
and school attendance (days per week), the Chalder Fatigue 
Scale27 and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs, derived from 
the EQ-5D-Y)28 at 3, 6 and 12 months. Pain was measured by 
a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at 6 
months. All were self-com-
pleted by participants. Participants also completed the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)29 and the Spence Chil-
dren’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS)30 at assessment, and at 3, 6 and 12 
months. At 3, 6 and 12 months, parents completed an adapted 
four-item Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: General 
Health V2.0 questionnaire (V2.0)31 and a resource use question-
naire assessing their child’s health service use (eg, general prac-
titioner or specialist care), educational service use (eg, school 
counsellor), health-related travel and other family costs.
Time windows for questionnaire return were prespecified as 
6 
weeks after the 3-month follow-up, 6 
weeks before or up to 
3 
months after the 6-month follow-up and 3 
months before or 
after the 12-month follow-up. Those who had not responded 
within 1 
week were sent a reminder letter with a reduced set 
of questionnaires (SF-36-PFS, Chalder Fatigue Scale and school 
attendance). From February 2011, non-responders were tele-
phoned by a researcher and the SF-36-PFS and Chalder Fatigue 
Scale were completed over the phone to improve follow-up 
rates.
sample size
We used a consensus definition for a small clinically important 
difference of 10 points on the SF-36-PFS.32 Thirty two to 50 
participants in each arm are required to detect a between-group 
difference of 8 to 10 points on the SF-36-PFS (SD 10) at 6 
months 
with 90% power and 1% two-sided significance. Allowing for 
10% to 20% 
non-collection of primary outcome data, we aimed 
to recruit 80 to 112 participants.

statistical analysis
The statistical analysis plan was agreed by the study management 
group and published on our website prior to analyses. The primary 
analysis compared mean SF-36-PFS scores at 6 
months according 
to randomised allocation among participants with measured 
outcomes, using multivariable linear regression adjusting for 
baseline values of the outcome, baseline age and gender. Similar 
regression analyses were conducted for secondary outcomes. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome adjusted for vari-
ables for which there was baseline imbalance; excluded those 
recruited up to 31 January 2011 preceding the protocol amend-
ment; and used multiple imputation of missing data (see online 
supplementary appendix 1 for details). Missing items in partially 
completed scales (Chalder Fatigue and SF-36-PFS) or subscales 
(SCAS and HADS anxiety and depression) were imputed using 
the mean of completed items, if only one item (or two for the 
SCAS subscales) was missing. If more items were missing the 
whole scale or subscale was scored as missing. T
welve-month 
outcome data were analysed similarly. We conducted a repeated 
measures analysis using all follow-up SF-36-PFS scores, with 
and without an interaction between allocation arm and time, 
to investigate whether between-group differences remained 
constant over time. We estimated the Complier Average Causal 
Effect (CACE), using instrumental-variables linear regression 
estimated via the generalised method of moments, of LP among 
compliers, defined as participants in the SMC+LP 
arm who 
completed all of the LP course.
Prespecified subgroup analyses explored differences in treat-
ment effect according to baseline age (<15 vs 15–17), gender, 
severity (none vs some school attendance at baseline) and 
comorbid anxiety (>or ≤12 on the HADS anxiety subscale) 
for the primary outcome, by adding an interaction term to the 
primary analysis multivariable linear regression model.
health economic analyses
We conducted a cost–utility analysis of SMC+LP from the health 
service and public sector perspective. We estimated the incre-
mental net monetary benefit (iNMB) of SMC+LP versus SMC, 
at a threshold willingness to pay of £20 000 (~US$30 000) per 
QALY.33 In the primary analysis, we used the cost of LP charged 
to the trial (mean £567). In sensitivity analyses, we (1) used 
the price of LP outside of trial (£620; July 2014 price) and (2) 
estimated cost of providing the LP intervention within the UK 
health service (online supplementary table S1). SMC outpa-
tient attendances were extracted from hospital records. Other 
healthcare use was based on parent report. Resource use was 
combined with 2013 unit costs including Agenda for Change 
pay bands effective from 1 April 2012 (online supplementary 
table S1).34–37 In the absence of a paediatric valuation for the 
EQ-5D-Y, we used the UK adult tariff.38 QALYs were estimated 
using the area under the curve.39 Incremental costs, QALYs and 
net benefits were adjusted for baseline values, age, gender and 
for variables where there was baseline imbalance. Non-para-
metric bootstrapping methods were used to calculate normally 
distributed 95% CIs around the iNMB. The probability that 
SMC+LP is cost-effective at varying willingness-to-pay thresh-
olds was estimated using a cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curve. Where one item of the EQ-5D-Y was missing (n=3), the 
mean of the other domains (rounded to the nearest integer) 
replaced the missing value. A high proportion of participants 
had missing resource use data at 3, 6 and 12 months. There-
fore, we conducted two analyses based on the complete case and 
multiply imputed datasets.
All analyses were conducted using Stata (Stata2013. Stata 
Statistical Software: Release 13.1).
results
Of 657 children assessed in the specialist CFS/ME clinic during 
the recruitment period, 631 were assessed for study eligi-
bility and 310 were eligible (figure 1). Among those eligible, 
136 consented to receiving further information and 100 were 
randomised: 49 to SMC only and 51 to SMC+LP
. Recruitment 
was stopped after the 100th participant was randomised. Eligible 
children and adolescents who found out more about the trial 
but were not randomised had lower anxiety and depression 
scores and attended more school (online supplementary table 
S2). Participants’ mean age was 14 years, 76 were female and 
all described themselves as British. Participants were disabled by 
their fatigue: only seven were attending full-time school and 47 
described themselves as attending 2 
days or less school a week.
Participants’ characteristics at baseline were balanced between 
arms except for pain and anxiety (SCAS) scores (table 1), which 
was adjusted for in sensitivity analyses. Five participants with-
drew from the study: two from the SMC and three from the 
SMC+LP 
arm. Outcome data were collected from 92 partici-
pants on at least one follow-up occasion. Baseline characteristics 
were similar between those who did (n=82) and did not (n=18) 
provide primary outcome data at 6 
months (online supplemen-
tary table S3). The mean (SD) time between clinical assessment 
and primary outcome collection was 6.8 (1.0) and 6.8 (0.7) 
months in the SMC and SMC+LP arms, respectively. Treatment 
as allocated was received by 46 (94%) and 39 (76%) participants 
in the SMC and SMC+LP arms, respectively. Three participants 
in the SMC+LP 
arm received the LP course after completing the 
6-month follow-up.
Mean SF-36 physical function improved more over time in 
participants allocated to SMC+LP than in those allocated to 
SMC (figure 2). Participants allocated to SMC+LP had better 
physical function at 6 
months than those allocated to SMC 
(table 2, adjusted difference in means 12.5 (95% CI 4.5 to 
20.5), p=0.003). This difference increased to 15.1 (95% CI 
5.8 to 24.4, p=0.002) at 12 months. These differences were 
similar when additionally adjusted for baseline anxiety (SCAS) 
and pain (VAS), when analyses were restricted to participants 
recruited from February 2011, and with multiple imputation of 
missing data (table 2). The average between-arm difference in 
physical function across both 6 and 12-month follow-up was 
14.4 (95% CI 7.3 to 21.5), p<0.001. The estimated effect of LP 
(using CACE analyses) among compliers at 6 and 12 months was 
increased compared with the intention-to-treat (ITT) estimate 
(table 2). There was little evidence that the effect of LP+SMC 
compared with SMC on the primary outcome differed according 
to baseline age, anxiety or school attendance (all interaction p 
values>0.3). There was weak evidence (online supplementary 
table S4) that the effect in males (adjusted difference in means 
26.6 (95%CI 8.9 to 44.3)) was greater than that in females 
(adjusted difference in means 9.0 (95% CI 0.2 to 17.8)) with an 
interaction p value of 0.08.
Participants in the SMC+LP 
arm had less fatigue (adjusted differ-
ence in means −4.7 (95% CI −7.9 to −1.6), p=0.003) (table 3) 
than those allocated to SMC and a greater improvement in anxiety 
symptoms measured by both the HADS (−3.3, (95% CI −5.6 to 
−1.0), p=0.005) and the SCAS (−8.7, (95% CI −16.9 to −0.5), 
p=0.039) scores at 6 
months. The difference in means in fatigue 
score and HADS anxiety score were somewhat smaller at 12 
months (−3.2 (95% CI −6.3 to −0.1) and −2·8 (−4.7 to –0.8)

respectively). However, the difference in means in SCAS anxiety 
was greater at 12 months (−12.1 (95% CI −20.1 to –4.1) and there 
was evidence that there was less depression among participants 
allocated to SMC+LP than those allocated to SMC at 12 months 
(adjusted difference in means in HADS depression score −1.7 (95% 
CI −3.3 to −0.2) p=0.030). Participants allocated to SMC+LP had 
better school attendance at 12 months than those allocated to SMC 
(adjusted difference in means 0.9 days of school per week (95% 
CI 
0.2 to 1.6) p=0.018). Pain scores were lower in participants allo-
cated to SMC+LP compared with those allocated to SMC at both 6 
and 12 months, but CIs were wide.
Five adverse events were reported (three in the SMC+LP 
arm). 
Four were related to participants and one to a parent. None were 
attributed to either SMC or LP
. Physical function at 6 
months 
deteriorated in nine participants, of whom eight were in the 
SMC arm. Five of the nine had deterioration of ≤10 on the 
SF-36 physical function subscale (range 0–100) which is less than 
the minimal clinically important difference.
EQ-5D-Y questionnaires were completed by 65, 82 and 80 
participants at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively (figure 3); 56 
completed EQ-5D-Y at all three follow-up time points. EQ-5D-Y 
scores were generally higher in the SMC+LP 
group. Differences 
in QALYs were evident at 12 months in the multiple imputa-
tion dataset (table 4, adjusted difference in means 0.095 QALYs 
(95% 
CI 0.030 to 0.160), p=0.004), but in the complete case 
dataset the CI included zero (adjusted difference in means 0.080 
QALYs (95% 
CI −0.064 to 0.225), p=0.276).
Complete healthcare use questionnaires were returned by 
between 55 (55% at 12 months) and 56 (56% at 3 and 6 months) 
participants, but only 30 (30%) completed these questionnaires

at all three time points (see online supplementary table S5 for 
details). The initial cost of LP was not fully offset by marginally 
lower costs of other care over the 12-month period. The incre-
mental cost (table 4) of SMC+LP was higher in both complete 
case (difference in means £445, (95% CI −57 to 947), p=0.082) 
and multiple imputation datasets (difference in means £390, 
(95% CI 189 to 591), p=0.000).
Table 4 shows that in the multiple imputation dataset there 
was good evidence that SMC+LP was more cost-effective than 
SMC alone (iNMB £1508 (95% CI £148 to £2869), p=0.034),

although the evidence was much weaker in the complete case 
dataset (figure 4). Sensitivity analyses varying the unit cost of LP 
treatment made no difference to this conclusion (online  supple-
mentary table S6, supplementary figure S1). Sensitivity analyses 
assuming costs and QALYs are not missing at random40 did not 
alter the conclusion that SMC+LP was likely to be cost-effec-
tive, but reduced the strength of the evidence.
DIscussIOn
This is the first randomised trial investigating the effectiveness of 
the LP for any condition. It is the first trial that has demonstrated 
the effectiveness of an intervention other than CBT for paedi-
atric CFS/ME. The addition of the LP to SMC improved physical 
function at 6 months in adolescents with CFS/ME and this differ-
ence increased at 12 months. The addition of LP also improved 
fatigue and anxiety at 6 
months, and fatigue, anxiety and depres-
sion at 12 months. Participants in the LP arm were attending 
1 
day more of school a week at 12 months. The initial cost of 
LP was not fully offset by lower subsequent costs of healthcare, 
but the improvements in health-related quality of life meant 
that SMC+LP is probably cost-effective using a threshold for a 
QALY of £20 
000 (~US$30 000). Participants in the Specialist 
Medical Intervention and Lightning Evaluation (SMILE) trial 
did not have any serious adverse events attributable to either 
treatment arm. The majority of those who experienced a deteri-
oration in physical function had a deterioration of ≤10 on the 
SF-36 PFS. The lack of serious adverse events is consistent with 
other treatment trials in CFS/ME.40
Strengths of the study include its randomised design and that 
we followed patients up for 12 months. Participants received SMC 
that is currently being delivered in the UK Health Service by a 
multidisciplinary team, and the LP as it is currently provided. More 
participants were lost to follow-up in the SMC arm, but baseline 
characteristics were similar in those followed and not followed 
up. Complete healthcare use questionnaires were returned by 
only 55 or 56 participants at each time point. We used multiple 
imputation to correct for potential bias due to missing data and 
conducted sensitivity analyses restricted to participants recruited 
after the protocol changed to collect primary outcome data by 
telephone, which improved follow-up rates suggesting that results 
were robust. We predefined the clinically important difference (10 
points) on the SF-36-PFS and the difference in means was greater 
than this at both 6 and 12 months. The study was not blinded, so 
that patient-reported outcomes may have been affected by partic-
ipants’ knowledge of the group to which they were randomised. 
Only 36 (70%) of those allocated LP attended the full course prior 
to the 6-month follow-up but we estimated the effect in all those 
who completed the full LP course.
The LP may not be suitable for all children and adolescents. 
Fewer than 30% of eligible children were randomised. We do 
not know why the majority did not want to take part in the trial 
but it may be because they did not want to take part in groups 
or travel for three consecutive days. We felt that it would be 
unethical to have a control group without treatment, and there-
fore we only know that LP is effective in addition to SMC and 
not whether it is effective on its own. We only recruited children 
aged 12 and over who were not housebound and who spoke 
English. We do not know whether LP is effective, acceptable or 
feasible for those who are severely affected, less than 12 years 
old or do not speak English.
Participants in both treatment arms improved. Those receiving 
SMC alone had a mean improvement that was similar to that seen 
in adults receiving CBT or Graded Exercise Therapy (GET).40

The improvement in SF-36-PFS in those receiving SMC+LP is 
consistent with those receiving treatment in previous paediatric 
trials investigating both family based and individual CBT.17 20 
The participants in our study who received SMC only did not 
improve as much as other trials investigating CBT17 20 which may 
be because on average they had less than half the number of 
treatment sessions. As we did not compare LP with either a full 
course of only CBT or GET, we do not know if LP is more of less 
effective than either of these treatment approaches.
Participants in the SMC+LP 
arm maintained or increased 
improvements compared with SMC alone at 12 months and 
this was true for both the ITT and the CACE analyses. This is 
in contrast to previous trials investigating internet-based CBT 
where the treatment effects were sustained but the difference 
between the two trial arms was reduced at 12 months compared 
with 3 
months19 22 and family-focused CBT versus psychoedu-
cation where treatment differences at 3 
months were not main-
tained at 6 or 12 
months.20
There is only one study23 investigating LP which used qual-
itative interviews to explore the views of nine 14–26 
year 
olds about their experiences. The main difference between LP 
and CBT appears to be the emphasis placed on physiological

of SMC plus LP at 12 months. *For any selected willingness to pay for 
a QALY (x axis), the probability that SMC plus LP is cost-effective can 
be estimated by reading up from that point on the x axis to the curve 
and then reading across to the probability (y axis). The dashed lines 
represent the lower National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained. QALY, quality-adjusted life years; 
LP, Lightning Process; SMC, specialist medical care.
