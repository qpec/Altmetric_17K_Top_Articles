ABSTRACT
Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a perceptual condition in which specific visual
and auditory stimuli consistently trigger tingling sensations on the scalp and neck, sometimes
spreading to the back and limbs. These triggering stimuli are often social, almost intimate, in
nature (e.g., hearing whispering, or watching someone brush her hair), and often elicit a calm and
positive emotional state. Surprisingly, despite its prevalence in the general population, no
published study has examined the neural underpinnings of ASMR. In the current study, the
default mode network (DMN) of 11 individuals with ASMR was contrasted to that of 11 matched
controls. The results indicated that the DMN of individuals with ASMR showed significantly less
functional connectivity than that of controls. The DMN of individuals with ASMR also demon-
strated increased connectivity between regions in the occipital, frontal, and temporal cortices,
suggesting that ASMR was associated with a blending of multiple resting-state networks. This
atypical functional connectivity likely influences the unique sensory-emotional experiences asso-
ciated with ASMR.

Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a
controversial condition in which specific visual and
auditory stimuli trigger tingling sensations on the
scalp, neck, and back. These “tingles” are typically
accompanied by positive emotions as well as a feeling
of deep relaxation (Barratt & Davis, 2015). What makes
ASMR distinct from other uncommon sensory experi-
ences such as frisson (tingling sensations, or “chills”,
associated with hearing music) is that ASMR triggers
are quite reliable, with the same videos or sounds con-
sistently eliciting tingles and relaxation in the same
individual. Even more intriguing is the nature of the
sensory triggers themselves; these stimuli are generally
social, almost intimate, in nature. A recent survey study
of over 450 individuals with ASMR found that whisper-
ing, close-up attention, and viewing slow movements
such as hair brushing elicited tingles in over half of
respondents (Barratt & Davis, 2015). ASMR has also
been linked with repetitive movements and sounds
(e.g., finger tapping) and alternating binaural auditory
stimuli. Recently, online communities with over 100,000
subscribers have developed to share videos specifically
created to elicit ASMR tingles (e.g., http://www.reddit.
com/r/asmr/). Surprisingly, despite its fascinating phe-
nomenology and apparent prevalence in the general
population, there are no published scientific studies
investigating the neural substrates underlying ASMR.
The current study addresses this issue by examining
the functional connectivity of a prominent resting-
state network – the default mode network (DMN)
(Raichle et al., 2001) – to determine if the brains of
individuals with ASMR differ from those of matched
control participants.
The DMN consists of the medial prefrontal cortex,
medial temporal gyri, bilateral inferior parietal cortices,
precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus (Buckner,
Andrews-Hanna, & Schacter, 2008; Raichle, 2015). In
the absence of cognitive or environmental stimulation,
the firing rates of neurons in these structures tend to
covary, suggesting that these regions are functionally
connected. Activity in the DMN is thought to represent
self-relevant thoughts and attention toward the internal
milieu rather than to external stimuli (Greicius, Krasnow,
Reiss, & Menon, 2003). However, the integrity of the
DMN is compromised in some neurological and neuro-
developmental conditions (e.g., Bluhm et al., 2007;

 Greicius, Srivastava, Reiss, & Menon, 2004; Kennedy &
Courchesne, 2008). This reduced functional connectivity
may reflect structural abnormalities of brain regions,
atypical densities of white-matter pathways connecting
DMN structures, and/or a functional reorganization
caused by changes in the firing rates of one or more
structures within the network (Chen, Wang, Zhu, Tan, &
Zhong, 2015; Luo et al., 2011). Reduced DMN connec-
tivity may therefore serve as a biomarker for atypical
neural functioning. Given that individuals with ASMR
experience
auditory-tactile
and
auditory-emotional
associations that are atypical of the general population,
we hypothesized that this group – like other groups
with altered perceptual experiences (Alderson-Day,
McCarthy-Jones, & Fernyhough, 2015; Jardri, Thomas,
Delmaire, Delion, & Pins, 2013) – would show weaker
connectivity between regions of the DMN than would
matched control participants.
In the current study, we also hypothesized that
ASMR would be associated with increased DMN activity
in sensory cortices, perhaps including brain regions not
typically associated with the DMN. If the DMN of these
individuals included additional functional connectivity
between sensory regions in the temporal (audition),
parietal (somatosensation), and occipital (vision) cor-
tices, it could suggest an increased openness to unu-
sual sensory experiences. Such group differences would
provide an intriguing initial glimpse into the neural
architecture underlying ASMR.
Methods
Participants
Eleven participants (five males) with ASMR between the
ages of 18 and 37 were recruited via word-of-mouth
and social media posts from the Winnipeg, Manitoba
community. All participants self-identified as having
ASMR; these responses were confirmed by having par-
ticipants view youtube.com videos designed to elicit
ASMR responses while in the presence of one of the
authors.
Although the current study did not assess brain
activity during an ASMR experience, it is worth noting
the characteristics of the ASMR tingles typically experi-
enced by our participants. To that end, ASMR partici-
pants also completed a checklist that asked them to
identify the different types of stimuli that trigger their
ASMR experiences, as well as the characteristics of these
responses. All participants reported being triggered by
whispering. Nine of the 11 participants (81.8%) also
reported experiencing tingles after hearing tapping or
scratching
sounds.
A
similar
proportion
of
the
participants responded to simulations of socially inti-
mate encounters (e.g., videos of simulated haircuts or
scalp checks). Importantly, the participants reported
that the same video or audio stimuli consistently elicit
ASMR tingles. The average intensity rating for ASMR
experiences was 4 (SD = 0.77) on a 5-point Likert
scale, with 5 representing an extremely intense sensory
experience. However, most participants indicated that
they could dampen the intensity of the experience if
they wished, an ability that distinguishes ASMR from
similar conditions such as synesthesia. Ten of the 11
participants reported that the intensity of their ASMR
tingles was larger when the actors in the videos
addressed the viewer directly rather than depicting a
scene from a third-person perspective. In contrast to
the homogeneous intensity ratings, the onset times
showed some variability. The average onset time for
ASMR tingles was 59.54 s (SD = 80 s), with a range
from 0 (i.e., immediate response) to 90 s.
Eleven sex- and age-matched control participants
(age range 18–40 years) were recruited from the
University of Winnipeg student population. All control
participants viewed two videos shown to elicit ASMR to
confirm that they did not experience tingling sensa-
tions. No participants had any history of psychiatric or
neurological illness.
Ethical approval was obtained from the University of
Winnipeg’s Human Research Ethics Board and the
University of Manitoba’s Bannatyne Human Research
Ethics Board. All participants gave written informed
consent and completed magnetic resonance safety
screening prior to scanning. Participants received $50
remuneration.
fMRI scanning parameters
Scanning was conducted using a 3-T Siemens scanner at
the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority MRI Clinic. One
hundred
seventy-six
T1-weighted
(magnetization-pre-
pared rapid gradient-echo, or MP-RAGE) images were col-
lected. The scanner parameters for the anatomic MRI were
as follows: TR = 1900 ms per volume, TE = 16 ms, with
256 mm × 256 mm resolution, and 0 mm between slices.
The voxel size was 1.000 mm × 0.977 mm × 0.977 mm.
The resting-state functional MRI run was 7 min in
duration and consisted of 140 volumes. Each volume
consisted of 40 slices and was sampled transversely
using a conventional whole-brain echo-planar imaging
sequence with the following parameters: TR = 3000 ms
per volume, TE = 75 ms, 3.75 mm × 3.75 mm resolution
and a slice thickness of 3 mm and field of view (FOV) of
240 mm × 240 mm. Participants were asked to close
their eyes but remain awake (i.e., to rest) for the

 duration of the scan. No stimuli were presented during
this time.
fMRI processing
Data
were
preprocessed
and
analyzed
using
BrainVoyager
QX
2.8.4
(Brain
Innovation,
Inc.,
Maastricht, The Netherlands). Anatomical scans were
manually transformed to Talairach space. Functional
data were corrected for 3D motion and slice scan time
and temporal filtering was performed. They were then
co-registered and linked to the corresponding Talairach
brains.
Each participant’s resting-state data were subjected
to an independent components analysis (ICA; Hyvärinen
& Oja, 2000) to determine which areas of the brain
showed correlated fluctuations in neural activity. This
analysis identified 20 individual components for each
participant. A self-organizing grouped ICA analysis
(Esposito et al., 2005) was then performed with all 22
participants. As with the individual analyses, 20 compo-
nents were produced. A 2-factor mixed-effects analysis
of covariance (RX-ANCOVA) was performed with the
within-subjects factor being the 20 fixed levels (20
components) and the between-subjects factor being
the two group levels (ASMR vs. Control). The DMN
was visually identified as being the fifth component.
From this ANCOVA table, the weights were set to zero
for all but the DMN component in all subjects and the
subjects were weighted in opposition representing
Group (ASMR vs. Control). This analysis produced a t-
map (t-threshold of 2.5 corresponding to p < 0.013, FDR
corrected to q < 0.050; cluster threshold set to 20
voxels) that allowed us to compare the degree of func-
tional connectivity in the DMNs of these two groups
(depicted in Figure 1). The functional connectivity clus-
ters were converted to volumes of interest; these
yielded Talairach coordinates for the peak voxels, prob-
ability values, and number of active voxels (see Table 1).
Talairach-daemon software (http://www.talairach.org/
daemon.html) was used to identify the anatomical
structures
associated
with
each
set
of
Talairach
coordinates.
Results
The results indicated that the DMN of individuals with
ASMR showed significantly less connectivity than that
of controls (Figure 1(a)). Reduced connectivity was
found between the right superior and middle temporal
gyri, precuneus, superior frontal gyrus, and posterior
cingulate, as well as the left superior temporal gyrus,

 medial frontal gyrus, and medial dorsal thalamus (see
Table 1).
Individuals with ASMR also showed greater DMN
functional connectivity than controls in some regions
of the cortex (Figure 1(b)). This connectivity occurred
between the left superior and middle frontal gyri, the
left middle temporal gyrus, the right precuneus, and
the right middle occipital gyrus (see Table 1). These
regions are typically part of executive control and visual
resting-state networks (Raichle, 2015).
Discussion
The reduced connectivity between the frontal lobes and
sensory and attentional regions in the precuneus and
parietal cortex has been linked with reduced attentional
control and inhibition in patient populations (Lin, Tseng,
Lai, Matsuo, & Gau, 2015); it is possible that ASMR reflects
a reduced ability to inhibit sensory-emotional experi-
ences that are suppressed in most individuals. The
decreased connectivity of the thalamus is also relevant
to the multimodal experiences in ASMR. There are two
published cases of individuals developing synesthesia –
a blending of the senses (Cytowic, 1993; Ramachandran
& Hubbard, 2003) – after suffering a thalamic infarct (Ro
et al., 2007; Schweizer et al., 2013). In one of these cases,
the patient developed anomalous sensory-emotional
associations (Schweizer et al., 2013). Atypical thalamic
connectivity may therefore lead to the tingling and emo-
tional responses that occur in ASMR.
It is possible that ASMR involves a blending of multiple
resting-state networks. This hypothesis is consistent with
experimental studies demonstrating that undifferentiated
networks may be associated with atypical perceptions
and conscious experiences (Alderson-Day et al., 2015;
Roseman, Leech, Feilding, Nutt, & Carhart-Harris, 2014). It
is important to note, however, that the current results do
not indicate that ASMR is a psychopathology. In fact, the
opposite may be true. Some individuals – including many
of the ASMR participants in our study – use ASMR videos
as a way of relaxing as well as to cope with stress and
depression (Barratt & Davis, 2015).
It is also worth stressing that the group differences in
DMN activity are statistical differences, not necessarily
biological ones. Additional studies examining group
differences in the volume and thickness of gray matter
regions (e.g., voxel-based morphometry and cortical
thickness analyses) and the density of white-matter
pathways (e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) are necessary
to fully characterize the neuroanatomical differences
associated with ASMR. Functional neuroimaging inves-
tigations of individuals during an ASMR experience
would also be helpful, although the loud noise of an
MRI scanner and the scalp electrodes used in EEG stu-
dies may interfere with the responses of some partici-
pants. The DMN differences identified in the current
research should inform the hypotheses in such studies
by providing potential regions of interest for further
investigation.
Although the current study did not find evidence
that specific characteristics of ASMR (e.g., specific trig-
gers) were linked with unique DMN activity, future
studies with a much larger sample size may allow
researchers to link individual differences in the hetero-
geneous ASMR phenomenology to differences in the
activity of different resting-state networks. As such, this
