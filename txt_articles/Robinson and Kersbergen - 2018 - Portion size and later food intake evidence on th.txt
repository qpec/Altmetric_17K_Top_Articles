Portion size and later food intake: evidence on the “normalizing” effect
of reducing food portion sizes

Institute of Psychology, Health, and Society, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom
ABSTRACT
Background: Historical increases in the size of commercially avail-
able food products have been linked to the emergence of a worldwide
obesity crisis. Although the acute effect that portion size has on food
intake is well established, the effect that exposure to smaller portion
sizes has on future portion size selection has not been examined.
Objective: We tested whether reducing a food portion size “renor-
malizes” perceptions of what constitutes a normal amount of that
food to eat and results in people selecting and consuming smaller
portions of that food in the future.
Design: Across 3 experiments, participants were served a larger or
smaller portion of food. In experiments 1 and 2, participants selected
and consumed a portion of that food 24 h later. In experiment 3, par-
ticipants reported on their preferred ideal portion size of that food
after 1 wk.
Results: The consumption of a smaller, as opposed to a larger, por-
tion size of a food resulted in participants believing a “normal”-sized
portion was smaller (experiments 1–3, P ≤ 0.001), consuming less
of that food 1 d later (experiments 1–2, P ≤ 0.003), and displaying a
tendency toward choosing a smaller ideal portion of that food 1 wk
later (experiment 3, P = 0.07), although the latter finding was not
significant.
Conclusion: Because consumer preferences appear to be driven by
environmental influences, reducing food portion sizes may recali-
brate perceptions of what constitutes a “normal” amount of food to
eat and, in doing so, decrease how much consumers choose to eat.

INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased dra-
matically in recent history in many parts of the developed world
(1). The emergence of the obesity crisis coincided with changes
in the food environment (2). During a relatively short time period,
a combination of factors has resulted in an “obesogenic”food en-
vironment that promotes overconsumption (3–5). One aspect of
the food environment that has changed is food portion size (6).
The portion size of some commercially available foods has in-
creased over time (7–9). This, coupled with evidence that portion
size has an acute (10, 11) and prolonged effect on energy intake
(12, 13), has led to suggestions that portion size has been a driver
of population-level weight gain (9, 14). There have been calls for
the need to “downsize” the default portion size of commercially
available food products in order to tackle overweight and obesity
(15, 16).
Reducing portion size has been shown to decrease acute en-
ergy intake, and this reduction may not be compensated for at
subsequent meals (17, 18). However, it is less clear whether there
would be other downstream consequences of reducing food por-
tion sizes. We hypothesize that reducing the portion size of a
food may “normalize”more appropriately sized portions and shift
people toward selecting and consuming smaller portions of that
food in the future. A key reason why the provision of smaller
portion sizes could “renormalize” more appropriate portion sizes
is because visual perception of what constitutes a normal size
or amount is driven by what humans are used to seeing in their
environment—otherwise known as their “visual diet” (19, 20).
Human eating behavior and appetite control is also recognized as
being flexible, in the sense that there is no tight physiologic con-
trol of energy intake and therefore no precise “correct”amount to
eat (21–23). Portion size is thought to communicate information
about what constitutes a normal amount of food to eat (24, 25).
What has received less attention is how humans determine what

 PORTION SIZE AND LATER FOOD INTAKE

a “normal”-sized portion is and how this affects decisions about
meal size (25, 26). Although multiple factors affect the amount
of food served at a meal, we hypothesized that perceptions of
what constitutes a “normal” portion size play a central role. In
the same way that it has been argued that the availability of su-
persized portions has normalized bigger portions (27), reducing
food portion sizes could serve to “renormalize” more appropri-
ately sized portions. In support of this, repeated visual exposure
to images of larger compared with smaller portion sizes of a food
has been shown to affect size judgments about an intermediate
portion size of that food (19).
Across 3 experiments we tested the hypothesis that providing
participants with smaller portion sizes of a food may recalibrate
their perceptions of what constitutes a “normal” portion size and,
in doing so, reduce the amount of that food that they choose to
eat in the future. In experiments 1–3, participants were served
and consumed either a larger or smaller portion of a lunch food,
quiche. The next day, under the guise of a cover story, the same
participants self-served and ate quiche (experiments 1 and 2). In
experiment 3, 1 wk after being served a larger or smaller portion
of quiche, participants selected the portion size of quiche they
would most like to eat. We hypothesized that the provision of a
smaller as opposed to larger portion size of quiche would result
in participants choosing to eat less quiche in the future and that
this would be explained by changes in the perception of the size
of a “normal” serving of quiche.
METHODS
Experiment 1
Participants and sample size
Participants were recruited from staff and students at the Uni-
versity of Liverpool into a laboratory study described as exam-
ining “food, mood, and reasoning” (cover story). In experiment
1, we sampled women only and participants were required to in-
dicate that they would be happy to eat quiche before participa-
tion. Potential participants with any history of food allergy or
who were currently dieting for weight loss were ineligible. We
decided a priori to recruit n = 40 participants/condition because
this would provide us with sufficient statistical power to detect
a medium-to-large effect of condition (1 − β ≥ 0.80, α = 0.05,
d = 0.65; GPOWER 3.1 (28), Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düs-
seldorf), but recruited slightly above this number to account for
any participants not following study instructions or identifying
the study aims.
Portion sizes
In experiments 1–3, we focused on a food (quiche) that pi-
lot testing indicated was palatable and acceptable to consume
at lunchtime. We based the larger portion size on a serving
size of quiche that the majority of pilot focus-group partici-
pants (n = 10) agreed would be typically served in a restau-
rant. We based the smaller portion size on a serving that
would be markedly reduced and that the majority of pilot group
participants agreed would still be an acceptable amount of
food to consume for lunch. In experiments 1 and 2, a broc-
coli and tomato quiche was used (Tesco supermarket). The
larger portion size condition was one-half of a full family-
sized quiche (200 g, 440 kcal), and the smaller portion size
condition was one-quarter of half a family-sized quiche (100 g,
220 kcal, which equated to the manufacturer’
s recommended
amount for 1 serving).
Procedure
Participants attended a first session during a weekday
lunchtime and were asked to abstain from eating for 2 h before
the session. After checking for food allergies, the researcher bol-
stered the cover story by informing participants that they would
complete mood questionnaires before eating lunch, and after eat-
ing lunch they would complete the same mood questionnaires and
a cognitive task. Participants were then asked to complete a se-
ries of mood ratings (e.g., “how happy are you right now?”) on
visual analog scales anchored with “not at all” and “extremely.”
The mood ratings also included how hungry and full partici-
pants were. When participants had completed the ratings, the
researcher returned with the lunch, which consisted of the ran-
domly assigned (computerized random-number generator) larger
or smaller portion of quiche with a 60-g side salad (lettuce leaves,
red cabbage, and carrot) on a standard dinner plate, as well as a
glass of water, and the researcher verbally asked the participant
if they would “eat all of the meal.” The participant signaled when
she had finished eating by pressing a buzzer. Participants then
completed ratings about the palatability of the quiche by using
the visual analog scales (anchors: “not at all” and “extremely”),
including how much they liked the quiche, before completing
the same mood rating as before lunch. To further corroborate the
cover story, participants were then provided with a cognitive task,
in which they had to identify missing letters in word stems to form
words. Participants were informed that they had 5 min to com-
plete as many word stems as possible and were provided with a
stopwatch to keep track of how much remaining time they had.
After 5 min, the researcher returned and explained that the first
session was complete and reminded participants to return for their
second session the following day.
Participants returned for the second session at lunchtime the
next day and were informed that they would be completing a
similar word completion task, but this time before lunch. Af-
ter completing the word stem task, participants then completed
the mood measures as in the first session. The researcher then
returned with a tray consisting of a full family-sized quiche
(400 g, 880 kcal) in a foil container, a full bag of salad (370 g), and
a glass of water. The researcher explained that they had not had
time to print the final questionnaires for the session, so told the
participants they could serve themselves whatever they wanted
to eat and that they would be back shortly. Once the participants
had finished eating they alerted the researcher by pressing the
buzzer and the researcher returned with the same mood measures
and palatability questionnaire as in the first session. Next, par-
ticipants were asked to write down what they thought the aims
of the study were before completing a final questionnaire. In the
final questionnaire, to measure perceptions of portion size nor-
mality, participants were asked “Which of the following portion
sizes would you say is a normal portion size of quiche to eat
for lunch?” and were shown 6 images of a broccoli-and-tomato
quiche, varying in portion sizes from one-eighth of a quiche to a
full family-sized quiche. Next, as a manipulation check, partici-
pants were shown the same images and asked which portion size
they had been served in session 1. Finally, participants completed

a questionnaire that included demographic information, items on
their eating habits, and a measure used to further probe demand
characteristics. To further probe demand characteristics, partic-
ipants were asked the extent to which they believed their food
intake was measured by the researcher, and we planned to exam-
ine whether our main results were dependent on this (see Sup-
plemental Methods for full details). Participants then had their
height and weight measured before being debriefed, were pro-
vided with a small monetary payment, and were thanked for their
time.
Main analysis strategy
We planned to examine the effect of portion size condition on
the amount of quiche that participants consumed (calculated in
grams from weighing the quiche and any leftovers pre-post lunch)
during session 2 by using an independent-samples t test. We com-
pared conditions on the portion size normality measure (ordinal
data) by using a Mann-Whitney U test. To examine whether the
effect of portion size condition on day 2 quiche consumption was
explained by changes in portion size normality, we used the PRO-
CESS macro for SPSS (29). All of the analyses were conducted in
SPSS 24.0. (See Supplemental Methods for further information
about the mediation analysis strategy and secondary analyses.)
We planned to exclude any participants from analyses who had
directly guessed the aims of the study (see Supplemental Methods
for more information) or who did not follow key study instruc-
tions (e.g., consuming less than half of the quiche provided in
session 1, eating nothing during session 2).
Experiment 2
In experiment 2, we aimed to replicate the findings of experi-
ment 1 and we sampled men instead of women participants.
We used the same method as in experiment 1 except for an
alteration to the food served during lunch. Pilot testing indicated
that a lunch of quiche and salad may not be sufficient for some
men, so in session 1 the lunchtime meal included a 25-g serving
of potato chips and in session 2 a 25-g bag of unopened potato
chips was included on the lunch tray.
Experiment 3
In experiment 3, we aimed to examine whether the effect of a
smaller portion size on subsequent portion size selection would
persist over a longer time period (1 wk later). We also designed
experiment 3 to further rule out demand characteristics. When
participants made their later portion size selection, they did so
among a series of other measures they believed were part of an
unrelated study being conducted by a different researcher.
Participants and sample size
Men and women were recruited from staff and students
at the University of Liverpool into a study described as ex-
amining “hunger and executive functioning.” In experiments
1 and 2, we observed medium-large statistical effects of
portion size condition on our dependent variables. Because we
reasoned that the effect may be smaller 1 wk later, we aimed to re-
cruit a sufficient number of participants to detect a medium-sized
statistical effect (n = 64/condition). We recruited slightly above
this number as in experiments 1 and 2.
Procedure
We used a similar procedure as in experiment 2, although par-
ticipants were served a cheese-and-onion quiche (279 kcal/100 g;
Tesco Supermarket) in experiment 3. The portion sizes were the
same as in experiments 1 and 2. Participants first completed a
3-min reaction time task in which they had to classify 40 letter
strings as words or nonwords as quickly and accurately as pos-
sible to corroborate the cover story. Next, participants completed
the mood measures before being provided with the randomly as-
signed smaller or larger portion size of quiche for lunch, along
with the side salad, potato chips, and water. Participants com-
pleted the same mood measures again, before completing a sim-
ilar reaction time task. Unlike experiments 1 and 2, participants
did not complete any measures about the lunch food during ses-
sion 1 to ensure that they were unaware of our interest in the
quiche. At the end of the session, the researcher informed the par-
ticipants that they would receive an e-mail in a week to complete
a short online survey. One week later, participants were redirected
to a survey site and first rated their hunger, as in experiments 1
and 2. Next, they completed a similar reaction-time task as in
session 1. After this, they completed some filler personality
items before being thanked for their time. On the next page,
participants were asked to take part in a different survey be-
ing conducted by another researcher and that the study involved
questions about food selection and eating habits. On consecutive
individual pages, participants were shown 6 images of varying
portion sizes of a common mealtime food. To disguise our in-
terest in the target food (cheese-and-onion quiche), there were 4
foods in total, and for each of the foods, participants were asked
“Which of the following portion sizes would you choose to eat
for lunch?” and “Which of the following portion sizes would you
say is normal to eat for lunch?” on separate pages. The cheese-
and-onion quiche was always presented second, and the order of
presentation of the selection and normality measure was counter-
balanced. Next, participants completed the manipulation check,
were asked questions about their eating habits (see Supplemental
Methods), and guessed the aims of the study. Finally, participants
were debriefed and thanked.
RESULTS
Experiment 1
Participant characteristics
Eighty-four participants were recruited. Four participants did
not attend the second session, 4 correctly identified the aims of
the experiment, and 1 did not follow study instructions (ate less
than half of the quiche during session 1), which left a final sample
size of 75 participants with a mean ± SD age of 31.9 ± 9.4 y and
a mean ± SD BMI (kg/m2) of 24.7 ± 4.8 (see Supplemental
Figure 1).
Session 1 food consumption
During the first session, participants in the larger portion size
condition consumed more quiche (mean ± SD: 176.5 ± 29.2 g)

Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the 2 portion size conditions on perceptions of portion size normality measured during session 2.
than participants in the smaller portion size condition (99.2 ±
9.6 g) and, as expected, this difference was significant
[t(73) = 15.50, P < 0.001, d = 3.56]. There was no significant
difference [t(73) = 0.82, P = 0.41, d = 0.19] in salad consump-
tion between the larger portion size condition (41.4 ± 19.1 g) and
the smaller portion size condition (44.7 ± 16.1 g) during the first
session.
Session 2 portion size normality and subsequent consumption
In line with our hypotheses, participants’ perception of a
normal-sized portion was significantly smaller in session 2 if they
had eaten the smaller (n = 38) as opposed to the larger (n = 37)
portion size during session 1 (U = 371.50, z = 3.76, P < 0.001,
r = 0.43) (see Table 1). Moreover, participants served the smaller
portion size (mean ± SD quiche consumed in session 2: 144.66
± 72.36 g) as opposed to the larger portion size (mean ± SD
quiche consumed in session 2: 189.81 ± 55.62 g) during ses-
sion 1 went on to freely serve themselves and consume signif-
icantly less quiche during session 2 [t(73) = 3.02, P = 0.003,
d = 0.70]. There was no evidence that the effect that the session
1 portion size condition had on session 2 quiche consumption
was influenced by whether or not participants believed their food
intake would be measured by the researcher (see Supplemental
Results). Mediation analysis confirmed that the effect of portion
size condition on day 2 quiche consumption was explained by
condition differences in portion size normality (see Table 2).
Self-reported appetite and liking
We examined whether self-reported fullness or hunger differed
according to portion size condition pre- and postlunch during
either session 1 or 2 by using a mixed ANOVA. As expected, par-
ticipants felt less hungry and fuller after eating in both sessions.
However, there was no effect of portion size condition or inter-
action between portion size condition and time point, indicating
that the effect on food intake that the smaller portion size had
did not result in participants reporting greater post-meal hunger
or reduced post-meal fullness during either session (see Supple-
mental Table 1). Participants’liking of the quiche in the smaller
and larger portion size conditions did not differ (see Supplemen-
tal Table 2).
Experiment 2
Participant characteristics
Eighty-three participants were recruited. This sample size was
consistent with our power analysis for experiment 1 and provided
adequate statistical power to detect the effects observed in ex-
periment 1. Two participants correctly identified the aims of the
experiment, and 3 did not follow study instructions (ate less than
half of the quiche during session 1), which left a final sample size
of 78 participants with a mean ± SD age of 24.5 ± 7.0 y and a
mean ± SD BMI of 25.2 ± 4.5 (see Supplemental Figure 2).
Session 1 food consumption
During the first session, participants in the larger portion
size condition consumed more quiche (mean ± SD: 195.1 ±
15.1 g) than did participants in the smaller portion size condition
(99.4 ± 11.2 g), and as expected, this difference was significant
[t(76) = 31.83, P < 0.001, d = 7.20]. There was a significant dif-
ference [t(76) = 2.20, P = 0.03, d = 0.50] in salad consumption
between the larger portion size condition (51.5 ± 14.8 g) and the
smaller portion size condition (57.2 ± 6.3 g) during the first ses-
sion. There was no significant difference [t(76) = 0.31, P = 0.76,
d = 0.07] in potato chip consumption between the larger portion
size condition (23.4 ± 4.5 g) and the smaller portion size condi-
tion (23.7 ± 4.5 g) during the first session.

Session 2 portion size normality and subsequent consumption
Participants’perception of a normal-sized portion was signifi-
cantly smaller in session 2 if they had eaten the smaller (n = 40)
as opposed to the larger portion size (n = 38) during session 1
(U = 422.00, z = 3.54, P < 0.001, r = 0.40) (see Table 1). More-
over, participants who consumed the smaller portion size (mean
± SD quiche consumed in session 2: 151.46 ± 78.21 g) as op-
posed to the larger portion size (mean ± SD quiche consumed
in session 2: 245.53 ± 80.54 g) went on to serve themselves and
consume significantly less quiche during session 2 [t(76) = 5.23,
P < 0.001, d = 1.19]. There was no evidence that the effect that
session 1 portion size condition had on session 2 quiche con-
sumption was influenced by whether or not participants believed
their food intake would be measured by the researcher (see Sup-
plemental Results). Mediation analysis confirmed that the effect
of portion size condition on day 2 quiche consumption was ex-
plained by condition differences in portion size normality (see
Table 2).
Self-reported appetite and liking
As in experiment 1, the same results were observed for self-
reported hunger and fullness, whereby there were no significant
differences in post-meal hunger or post-meal fullness between the
2 portion size conditions (Supplemental Table 3). Participants
also had a similar liking of the quiche in the smaller and larger
portion size conditions (Supplemental Table 4).
Experiment 3
Participant characteristics
A total of 140 participants were recruited. Three participants
did not complete the second questionnaire, 1 participant correctly
identified the aims of the experiment, and 12 participants did not
follow study instructions (ate less than half of the quiche dur-
ing session 1). The final sample of 124 participants (46 men, 78
women) had a mean ± SD age of 27.7± 9.6 y and a mean ± SD
BMI of 23.6 ± 4.1 (see Supplemental Figure 3).
Session 1 food consumption
During the first session, participants in the larger portion size
condition consumed more quiche (mean ± SD: 179.6 ± 31.9 g)
than did participants in the smaller portion size condition (97.6 ±
12.9 g), and as expected, this difference was significant
[t(122) = 19.38, P < 0.001, d = 3.37]. There was no signifi-
cant difference [t(122) = 0.42, P = 0.68, d = 0.07] in salad con-
sumption between the larger portion size condition (24.4 ± 9.2 g)
and the smaller portion size condition (23.8 ± 6.9 g) during the
first session. There was no significant difference [t(122) = 0.96,
P = 0.34, d = 0.29] in potato chip consumption between the
larger portion size condition (21.3 ± 12.2 g) and the smaller por-
tion size condition (29.4 ± 38.1 g) during the first session.
Portion size normality and selection at follow-up
Participants’perception of a normal-sized portion was signif-
icantly smaller 1 wk later if they had eaten the smaller (n = 68)
as opposed to larger portion size (n = 56) during session 1
(U = 1304.00, z = 3.24, P = 0.001, r = 0.29) (see Table 1). More-
over, participants who ate the smaller as opposed to the larger por-
tion size during session 1 tended to select a smaller size portion
size at follow-up (U = 1562.5, z = 1.80, P = 0.07, r = 0.16),
although this difference was not significant. Mediation analysis
confirmed that the effect of condition on later portion size selec-
tion was explained by condition differences in portion size nor-
mality (see Table 2).
Self-reported appetite
As in experiments 1 and 2, there were no effects of portion size
condition on self-reported appetite (Supplemental Table 5).
DISCUSSION
In 3 experimental studies that served participants a smaller as
opposed to a larger portion size of food resulted in them later
perceiving a “normal”-sized portion of that food to be smaller. In
experiments 1 and 2, this also resulted in participants selecting
and eating less of that food the next day. In experiment 3, this re-
sulted in participants tending to select a smaller ideal portion size
of that food 1 wk later, although this finding was not significant
(P = 0.07).
The present research was motivated by the observation that the
portion size of many commercially available food products has
increased over time and “supersized” products are now common
(7, 14). It has also been suggested that larger portions of food
have distorted consumer awareness of the recommended serving
sizes of foods (30, 31) and that one of the reasons why food por-
tion size affects acute energy intake is because portion size may
signal a “normal” amount to eat (24). We reasoned that because
humans will base perceptions of stimulus normality on what they
encounter in their environment (19), downsizing the portion size
of a food product should result in consumers adjusting their per-
ceptions of what a normal-sized serving of that food is and this
would affect future behavior. To our knowledge, the present ex-
periments provide the first empirical evidence in support of this.
There have been suggestions that shrinking the portion size of
commercially available food products could be one approach to
reducing overconsumption and tackling population-level obesity
(9, 15, 32). The present findings indicate that if portion sizes of
commercially available foods were reduced, these smaller, more
appropriate portion sizes may “normalize.” Across all 3 exper-
iments, we also found no evidence that smaller portion sizes
were associated with reduced fullness or increased hunger post-
meal. These findings corroborate other laboratory studies, which
show that decreasing portion size can reduce food intake with-
out causing later compensatory eating (33, 34). More generally,
the present findings are in keeping with current theoretical ac-
counts of human eating behavior, which suggest that there is no
“tight”control of energy intake on a meal-by-meal basis (21, 23).
Thus, there is a flexible range of meal sizes that are likely to be
acceptable to consumers. Dependent on what is “normal” in a
consumer’
s food environment, this flexibility in acceptable meal
sizes can presumably result in chronic over- or undereating. What
is unclear from the present studies is whether the consumption of
a smaller portion size of food is required for smaller portions of
that food to “normalize” or whether similar effects would be ob-
served vicariously (e.g., seeing others consume smaller portions

may alter perceptions of portion size normality). Likewise, we fo-
cused on one food in the present studies, so it is unclear whether
similar effects would be observed for foods that are more (or less)
frequently consumed. It is plausible that perceptions of portion
size normality for foods that are frequently eaten are less mal-
leable than less familiar foods.
There are many historical examples of public health policies
that may have seemed like a substantial change at the time or
were met with some initial reactance but soon normalized. For
example, since the turn of the century, the amount of salt in food
products has decreased and as a result consumers are now eating
less salt, which has been of benefit to public health (35, 36). Like-
wise, the implementation of smoke-free legislation in the United
Kingdom, the United States, and many other countries has “de-
normalized” smoking and in doing so likely saved thousands of
lives (37). There is now consensus that, irrespective of their level
of popular appeal, similar large-scale environmental changes are
required in order to renormalize the food environment and effec-
tively tackle the obesity crisis (2, 3, 5).
The present research has strengths and limitations. Findings
were replicated across 3 experiments and the use of cover sto-
ries minimized demand characteristics. Yet, although we made
efforts to minimize the potential influence of demand character-
istics in our experiments, the replication of our findings under
“free-living” conditions in which demand characteristics would
be minimal may be valuable. A limitation is that we sampled a
predominantly young, white, middle-class population. Although
demographic characteristics such as social class are thought to
influence nutrition (38), we do not know of a strong rationale as
to why our main findings would be different across other popula-
tions and this remains an empirical question. A further limitation
of the present experiments is that some of our self-report mea-
sures were not widely used validated instruments. For example,
the measure of portion size normality did not include a full range
of possible portion sizes of quiche, and this may have introduced
measurement bias due to fewer response options at the upper end
of the scale. Although this bias would be observed across both
experimental conditions, it may have resulted in a less-precise
measurement of portion size norm perceptions.
An unanswered question from the present research is how long
the effects we observed would last. For example, the effects ob-
served on food intake 1 d later in the laboratory (experiments
1 and 2) were larger than when portion size preference was ob-
served 1 wk later outside of the laboratory (experiment 3), al-
though other methodologic differences between the experiments
may account for this observation. On the basis of the notion that
perceptions of portion size normality are environmentally driven,
we presume that these effects would persist, provided that con-
sumers continue to encounter smaller-sized portions of the food
item in question more frequently than supersized portions. The
present studies are also unable to tell us about the extent to which
reducing the portion size of one type of food item would affect
portion size preferences for other similar food items (a form of
“transfer” effect), and this would be an interesting question to
answer. In addition, the present studies do not allow us to draw
conclusions about the independent effects that smaller and larger
portion sizes have on changes in perceptions of portion size nor-
mality. The smaller and larger portion sizes used in the present
studies differed somewhat in their shape as well as size, so stan-
dardizing shape across portion sizes would be preferable in future
research. Finally, because of practical constraints, we measured
portion size normality in experiments 1 and 2 after session 2 food
intake and it is possible that the amount that participants ate dur-
ing session 2 affected their perceptions of portion size normality.
Conclusions
In conclusion, serving participants a smaller portion size of a
food affected their perceptions of what constitutes a normal-sized
serving and resulted in them choosing to eat less of that food in
future. Because consumer preferences are, in part, driven by envi-
ronmental influence, reducing food portion sizes may recalibrate
perceptions of a “normal” amount of food to eat and, in doing so,
decrease how much consumers freely choose to eat. These results
suggest that downsizing the default size of food products may re-
sult in the “renormalization” of smaller food portion sizes.
The authors’responsibilities were as follows—ER: designed and oversaw
the data collection of experiments 1 and 2; IK: oversaw the data collection of
experiment 3; and both authors: designed experiment 3 and were responsible
for data analysis, had full access to the data, and read and approved the final
manuscript. The authors reported no competing interests.
