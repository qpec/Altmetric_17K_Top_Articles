Background-—The American Heart Association introduced the Life’s Simple 7 (LS7) metrics to assess and promote cardiovascular
health. We examined the association between the LS7 metrics and noncardiovascular disease.
Methods and Results-—We studied 6506 men and women aged between 45 and 84 years, enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis. Median follow-up time was 10.2 years. Each component of the LS7 metrics (smoking, body mass index, physical
activity, diet, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood glucose) was assigned points, 0 indicates “poor” category; 1,
“intermediate,” and 2, “ideal.” The LS7 score, ranged from 0 to 14, was created from the points and categorized as optimal (11–
14), average (9–10), and inadequate (0–8). Hazard ratios and event rates per 1000 person-years were calculated for outcomes
based on self-reported hospitalizations with the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, diagnoses of cancer, chronic
kidney disease, pneumonia, deep venous thromboembolism/pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
dementia, and hip fracture. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, and education. Overall, noncardiovascular
disease event rates were lower with increasing LS7 scores. With the inadequate LS7 score as reference, an optimal score was
associated with a decreased risk for noncardiovascular disease events. The hazard ratio for cancer was, 0.80 (0.64–0.98); chronic
kidney disease, 0.38 (0.27–0.54); pneumonia, 0.57 (0.40–0.80); deep venous thromboembolism/pulmonary embolism, 0.52
(0.33–0.82), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 0.51 (0.31–0.83).
Conclusions-—The American Heart Association’s LS7 score identified individuals who were vulnerable to multiple chronic
nonvascular conditions. These results suggest that improving cardiovascular health will also reduce the burden of cancer and other
chronic diseases. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003954 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.116.003954)

n the United States (US), the burden of noncardiovascular
diseases (non-CVDs) such as cancers and chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease (COPD) is substantial.1 According to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, non-CVDs
were responsible for over 1 500 000 deaths combined in
2011.2 Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US
behind
cardiovascular
diseases
(CVDs),2
and
the
age-
standardized prevalence of COPD in some US states is as
high as 9%.3
The American Heart Association’s (AHA’s) 2020 impact
goal is to improve the cardiovascular health (CVH) of all
Americans by 20% by 2020, while reducing deaths from CVD
and stroke by 20%.4 Implicit in this goal is improvement for all
Americans including underserved racial groups and across the

 age spectrum. To achieve this goal, a new concept, ideal CVH,
was introduced as a means to assess, monitor, and promote
CVH and wellness.4 Ideal CVH is defined as the presence of 4
ideal health behaviors (nonsmoking, body mass index [BMI]
<25 kg/m2, physical activity at goal levels, and diet consis-
tent with recommended guidelines) and 3 ideal health factors
(untreated total cholesterol <200 mg/dL, blood pressure (BP)
<120/80 mm Hg, and fasting blood glucose <100 mg/dL).
These 7 health behaviors and factors have been termed Life’s
Simple 7 (LS7) metrics.4 The inverse relationship between
ideal CVH and CVD incidence is well documented.4–14
However, research exploring the association between ideal
CVH and non-CVDs has just begun.15–19
Our aim in this study was to examine the association
between the AHA’s LS7 metrics and non-CVDs among
participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis
(MESA), an ethnically diverse study population. We hypothe-
sized that participants with optimal LS7 scores would be less
likely to develop non-CVDs.
Methods
Study Population
MESA is a multicenter, prospective cohort study that started in
2000. Individuals between the ages of 45 and 84 years, free of
clinical CVD at baseline, were recruited to investigate the
prevalence, correlates, and progression of subclinical CVD.
Details of the study design have been previously described.20
The sample size was 6814 participants of whom 38% of
participants were white, 28% Black, 23% Hispanic, and 11%
Chinese-American. Recruitment from 6 field centers (Balti-
more, MD; Chicago, IL; Forsyth County, NC; Los Angeles, CA;
New York, NY; and St Paul, MN) occurred between July 2000
and September 2002. Informed consent was obtained from
study participants and the study protocol was approved by the
institutional review boards of the 6 field centers. The present
study included 6506 MESA participants. Our exclusion criteria
were incomplete baseline data on education, income, or the
LS7 metrics (n=308). Data collection was between 2000 and
2015 while analysis was conducted in 2015.
Measurement of LS7 Metrics
Between 2000 and 2002, baseline levels of LS7 metrics
(smoking, BMI, physical activity, diet, BP, total cholesterol,
and blood glucose) were measured and categorized into ideal,
intermediate, and poor according to the AHA criteria4
(Table
S1)
with
modifications
in
MESA
as
previously
reported.21 Smoking status was assessed using question-
naires developed by the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey III, the National Health Interview Survey,
and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC). Participants
were classified as current smokers, former smokers if they
quit within the past 12 months, or never smokers if they quit
more than 12 months ago. BMI was calculated from height
and weight measurements. Physical activity was measured
using a detailed questionnaire adapted from the Cross-
Cultural Activity Participation Study.22 The questionnaire
identifies the time and frequency spent in activities during a
typical week in the previous month using 28 questions
including household chores, lawn/yard/garden/farm, care of
children/adults, transportation, walking (not at work), dancing
and sport activities, conditioning activities, leisure activities,
and occupational and volunteer activities. Minutes of walking,
conditioning, and leisure activities were also included as
exercise, and the minutes of moderate and vigorous exercise
were calculated from the questionnaire. Diet assessment was
performed using a validated 120-item food frequency ques-
tionnaire modified from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis
Study instrument.23,24 Diet was defined according to AHA
criteria using 5 components of healthy diet (high intake of
fruits and vegetables, fish, whole grains, low intake of sodium
and sugar-sweetened beverages).4 For BP, 3 measurements
were taken after participants had rested for 5 minutes. The
average of the last 2 measurements was recorded and used
for analysis. Total cholesterol and blood glucose levels were
obtained from fasting blood samples.
We used a previously defined scoring system21 where
points were assigned to each category of the LS7 metrics and
summed: ideal=2 points, intermediate=1 point, and poor=0
point, for a total score ranging from 0 to 14 points.25 Study
participants who scored 0 to 8 points were classified as
inadequate, those who scored 9 or 10 points were classified
as average, and participants who scored 11 to 14 points were
classified as optimal.21 Table S1 presents the proportion of
MESA participants who fall into each category of the metrics.
Non-CVD Outcomes
Participants of MESA were followed up every 9 to 12 months
for a median of 10.2 years (mean=9.5 years, interquartile
range 9.7–10.7 years) and self-reported any hospitalizations
that had occurred since the last follow-up. Upon report of a
hospitalization, medical records were requested. The proto-
cols and criteria for verification and diagnosis of non-CVD
events have been previously reported.20 Non-CVD diagnoses
were extracted from inpatient records using the International
Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9). For this study,
we included ICD-9 codes related to the following categories:
any malignant neoplasm, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
indicators of end-stage kidney disease, pneumonia, deep
venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), COPD,
dementia, and hip fracture. A complete list of the codes used

 is presented in Table S2. Coronary heart disease (CHD) and
CVD events were adjudicated by the MESA mortality and
morbidity review committee.
Statistical Analysis
Characteristics of study participants such as sex, race/
ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (education and income)
were reported by the LS7 score. Categorical variables were
presented as frequency and percentages while continuous
variables were presented as mean and standard deviation
(SD). Comparison between the characteristics of participants
and the LS7 score were tested using chi-square tests for
categorical variables and ANOVA for continuous variables. The
event rate per 1000 person-years for each non-CVD diagnosis
was calculated. In a multivariable-adjusted model, we calcu-
lated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for each non-CVD
diagnosis analyzed separately by the categories of the LS7
score (inadequate LS7 score served as reference) and the HR
(95% CI) of the aggregate measure of the first occurrence of
any of the non-CVD diagnoses. Covariates included age, sex,
race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. We constructed
Kaplan–Meier curves for non-CVD-free survival. Two separate
sensitivity analyses were performed where participants with
any nonfatal CHD event or nonfatal CVD event at or before
the time of the non-CVD diagnosis were excluded from the
study sample. These accounted for the potential identification
bias of a comorbid illness during admission for CHD or CVD.
A P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses
were conducted in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with the
exception of the Kaplan–Meier curves, which were con-
structed using Stata 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Baseline Characteristics of the Study Population
Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. Among the
6506 study participants, 20.1% had optimal LS7 scores,
32.6% had average scores, and 47.3% had inadequate scores.
The distribution of the LS7 score is presented in Figure 1.
Participants with optimal scores were more likely to be
Caucasian or have more than a college education while those
with inadequate scores were more likely to be on medication
for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus
(Table 1). Approximately 0.1% of participants met the ideal
criteria for all 7 components of the LS7 metrics.
Cancer
Cancer diagnosis codes (Table S2) were observed in 764
(11.7%)
participants.
The
event
rate
of
cancer
per
1000 person-years by LS7 score was 9.2, 11.5, and 13.3
for optimal, average, and inadequate scores, respectively
(Figure 2). Those with inadequate LS7 scores accounted for
51.4% of cancer cases. Unadjusted and adjusted HRs are
presented in Table 2. In multivariable-adjusted models, with
the inadequate scores serving as reference, participants with
optimal scores had a 20% lower risk for developing cancer,
and while not statistically significant, those with average
scores had a 10% lower risk.
Chronic Kidney Disease
CKD was documented in 454 (7.0%) participants. The event
rate of CKD was 2.9 cases per 1000 person-years for optimal
LS7 scores, 5.3 cases per 1000 person-years for average
scores, and 9.8 cases per 1000 person-years for inadequate
scores (Figure 2). The risk for developing CKD was 40% and
62% lower for those with average and optimal LS7 scores,
respectively (Table 2). After excluding participants with esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate ≤60 mL/min at baseline, HR
was 0.49 (0.32–0.76) for participants with average scores and
0.29 (0.14–0.59) for those with optimal scores.
Pneumonia
Pneumonia was identified in 334 (5.1%) participants. The
event rate was 6.1 cases per 1000 person-years for partic-
ipants with inadequate LS7 scores. Those with average scores
had an event rate of 4.9 cases per 1000 person-years
(Figure 2) and the HR for developing pneumonia was 0.82
(0.64–1.04) (Table 2). Participants with optimal scores had a
much lower event rate, 3.0 cases per 1000 person-years, and
a 43% lower risk for developing pneumonia.
DVT or PE
There were 215 (3.3%) cases of DVT or PE, with over half of
the diagnoses made in participants with inadequate LS7
scores and 11% in participants with optimal scores. Event
rates were 4.0, 3.1, and 1.7 per 1000 person-years for
participants with inadequate, average, and optimal scores,
respectively (Figure 2). HRs for developing DVT or PE for
participants with average and optimal scores were 0.82
(0.60–1.11) and 0.52 (0.33–0.82), respectively (Table 2).
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
COPD was identified in 174 (2.7%) participants. The majority
of the diagnoses (61%) were in participants with inadequate
scores. The event rate was �3 times higher in participants
with inadequate scores compared with those with optimal
scores, 3.5 cases versus 1.4 cases per 1000 person-years

 (Figure 2). Participants with average and optimal scores had a
35% and 49% lower risk for developing COPD (Table 2).
Similarly, the associations remained essentially unchanged
after the exclusion of participants with a diagnosis of COPD at
baseline. The HR was 0.60 (0.41–0.89) for participants with
an average score and 0.48 (0.28–0.83) for those with optimal
scores.
Dementia
Dementia was documented in 156 (2.4%) study participants.
The event rates per 1000 person-years were 1.8, 2.0, and 2.8
for the optimal, average, and inadequate LS7 scores, respec-
tively
(Figure 2).
Participants
with
inadequate
scores
accounted for 55.8% of the diagnoses. For participants with
optimal scores, the HR for developing dementia was 0.80
(0.50–1.27), while for those with average scores, the HR was
0.67 (0.46–0.98) (Table 2).
Hip Fractures
Hip fractures were observed in 61 (0.9%) study participants.
Most of the cases (47.5%) were diagnosed in participants with
inadequate LS7 scores while only 18% were in participants

 with optimal scores. The event rate for hip fractures was 0.9
cases per 1000 person-years for both participants with
inadequate and average scores. For those with optimal
scores, the event rate was 0.8 per 1000 person-years
(Figure 2). Although not statistically significant, average and
optimal scores were associated with a lower risk for
developing hip fractures (HR 0.82 [0.46–1.45] and HR 0.71
[0.34–1.48], respectively (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
In the stratified analyses presented in Table 3, the risk for
developing non-CVDs was lower irrespective of age, sex, and
race/ethnicity for participants with optimal and average
scores compared with those with inadequate scores. How-
ever, many of the associations were not statistically signif-
icant. In addition, there was little difference between the
results before and after the exclusion of participants with an
interim or concurrent nonfatal CHD event or nonfatal CVD
event. Although some results were not statistically significant,
the risk for developing non-CVD events remained lower for
those with average and optimal scores (Tables 4 and 5). As
illustrated in Table 6, the ideal and intermediate categories of
the health behaviors and factors of the LS7 metrics,
particularly smoking, physical activity, BP, and blood glucose
were associated with a lower risk of developing non-CVDs,
although some of the associations were not statistically
significant. Event rates per 1000 person-years by age, sex,
and race/ethnicity are presented in Figures S1 through S12.
Overall, optimal LS7 scores were associated with a lower risk
and event rates of non-CVDs.

 Discussion
Summary of Findings
In this multiethnic prospective cohort study, participants who
had average and optimal LS7 scores were less likely to
develop non-CVDs when compared with participants with
inadequate scores. Overall, the risk for developing non-CVDs
were particularly lower for those with optimal scores.
However, the HRs for dementia and hip fractures were not
statistically significant. Moreover, similar associations were
observed across age, sex, and race/ethnic subgroups.
Comparison With Previous Studies
The LS7 metrics were introduced as a means of assessing,
monitoring, and promoting CVH at both the individual and
population levels. Numerous studies have established that
higher numbers of ideal LS7 metrics or higher LS7 scores are
strongly associated with favorable outcomes.4–14 Our results
are comparable to the findings of prior studies that have
shown an inverse relationship between higher LS7 scores and
the incidence of non-CVD.15–19 In the ARIC study, Rasmussen-
Torvik et al demonstrated that participants with 6 or 7 ideal
metrics had a 51% lower risk of cancer compared with those
with 0 to 2 ideal metrics.15
Studies including the Reasons for Geographic and Racial
Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study demonstrated that
participants with intermediate and high LS7 scores have a
lower incidence of cognitive impairment when compared with
participants with inadequate LS7 scores.17–19 Muntner et al
in the REGARDS study reported a significantly lower risk of
developing end-stage renal disease with increasing numbers
of ideal LS7 metrics. In the same cohort, Olson et al found a
favorable prognosis for the risk of incident VTE among
participants with ideal CVH status. In our study we found that
optimal and average LS7 scores were associated with lower
event rates for non-CVD outcomes such as COPD, pneumonia,
and hip fracture. However, some of our results were not
statistically significant.
It has been established that some components of the LS7
metrics such as smoking are known risk factors for COPD,
pneumonia, and hip fractures while physical inactivity and
nutritional deficiencies contribute to the pathophysiology of
hip fractures.26–28 It is also of interest that obesity (BMI
≥30 kg/m2) may reduce the risk of hip fractures in women.29
Additionally, the prognosis of COPD is worsened by the
presence of comorbid illnesses such as hypertension and
diabetes mellitus.30 Although research showing the associa-
tion between the LS7 metrics and the aforementioned non-
CVD outcomes is sparse, prior studies have demonstrated
that having higher numbers of ideal LS7 metrics are
associated
with
a
lower
risk
of
mortality
from
all
causes.10,31–33
Furthermore, our study highlights the association between
each LS7 metric and non-CVD events. For example, achieving
the ideal category for smoking and physical activity was
associated with a lower risk for developing most of the non-
CVDs measured. In contrast, participants in the ideal category
for diet and total cholesterol were more likely to have some of
the non-CVDs such as dementia and hip fracture, although the
associations were not statistically significant. Detailed anal-
ysis from pooled studies will be required to further clarify the
impact of the individual LS7 metrics on non-CVD outcomes.
Implications
Healthcare expenditures have been continuously increasing
over the years. In 2013, �$3 trillion was spent on healthcare
in the US, an increase of 3.6% from the previous year and an
estimated $9000 per person.34 Most of these expenses go
towards the management of preventable diseases.35 The LS7

 metrics may provide an effective avenue for reducing
healthcare expenditure. The strategy of the concept is
primordial prevention where efforts are directed at preventing
the development of risk factors in contrast to primary or
secondary prevention where the focus is on the prevention of
the first occurrence or recurrence of a disease.4,36 In a study
on the association of ideal CVH and long-term healthcare
cost, Willis et al found that having more ideal components of
the LS7 metrics in middle age was associated with lower CVD
and non-CVD healthcare costs in later life.37
Strengths and Limitations
The major strengths of this study include the large popula-
tion-based sample, the diverse ethnicity of participants, the
detailed and validated collection of data, and the sensitivity
analyses performed. Our study also has limitations. The use
of self-administered questionnaires for data collection on
smoking, diet, and physical may be subject to recall bias.
Because MESA uses self-reported hospitalization and ICD
hospital codes for identifying new cases of non-CVDs,
interpretation of time-to-non-CVD events should be time-to-
diagnosis and not time-to-disease onset.38 The use of ICD
hospital codes may have led to under-ascertainment of non-
CVD events and sampling bias towards the inclusion of
severe cases of non-CVDs, while inadvertently excluding mild
cases that were managed in an outpatient setting.38 Also,
confirmation of non-CVD diagnosis was administrative and so
does not represent systematically adjudicated events.20 We
made reference to event rates because non-CVD events were
not excluded at baseline. Nevertheless, the results of the
sensitivity analyses showed small changes in HRs after the

 exclusion of participants with estimated glomerular filtration
rates <60 mL/min and those with a diagnosis of COPD at
baseline.
Conclusions
The present study shows that favorable CVH status is
significantly associated with lower rates of non-CVD events.
Encouraging individuals to optimize their CVH will serve as a
means to improve overall well-being at both the individual
and population levels and may also curtail healthcare
expenditures.
