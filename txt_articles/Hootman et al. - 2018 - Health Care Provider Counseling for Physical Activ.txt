 Age Adjustment Using
the 2000 Projected U.S. Population
Richard J. Klein, M.P.H., and Charlotte A. Schoenborn, M.P.H.
Introduction
Age adjustment, using the direct method, is the
application of observed age-specific rates to a standard age
distribution to eliminate differences in crude rates in
populations of interest that result from differences in the
populations’ age distributions. This adjustment is usually
done when comparing two or more populations at one point
in time or one population at two or more points in time. Age
adjustment is particularly relevant when populations being
compared have different age structures, for example, the
U.S. white and Hispanic populations. The classic literature
on age adjusting,1 as well as more recent National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) publications,2–5 has focused on
adjusting death rates and provides comprehensive
discussions of age-adjustment techniques. However, age
adjustment can be applied to any population-based event.
This report describes several sets of age-adjustment
weights, based on the year 2000 projected U.S. population,
that were used to generate age-adjusted baseline data for a
number of Healthy People 2010 objectives.6 This work
builds on the foundation set by the Department of Health
and Human Services (DHHS), which established the year
2000 projected U.S. population as the standard population
for age adjusting mortality statistics. The sets of weights
provided in this paper use the age groupings most commonly
found in existing DHHS publications. Age-adjustment
weights, as well as examples of computer codes appropriate
for calculating age-adjusted rates for complex sample
surveys using the SUDAAN7 software package, are provided
in this report. The weights and procedures shown are not
intended as fixed rules for age adjustment, but rather as
guidelines to promote and facilitate consistency and
comparability in age-adjustment procedures among users of
health-related data.
Historical Perspective
Several years ago, NCHS coordinated an effort that
resulted in an agreement among certain Federal and State
agencies to age adjust mortality data using the year 2000
projected U.S. population.3,4 In August 1998, the Secretary
of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)

 issued a policy statement directing all DHHS agencies to use
the year 2000 projected U.S. population (hereafter referred
to as the 2000 Standard Population) for age adjusting death
rates beginning no later than data year 1999.8 This
agreement resolved long-standing problems associated with
the use of different standard populations for age adjusting
death rates (U.S. 1940 population, U.S. 1970 population,
U.S. 1980 population, etc.) by various agencies publishing
mortality statistics, and the resultant difficulties experienced
by data users in comparing these rates.
The decision to age adjust mortality data using the 2000
Standard Population focused on mortality data from the
National Vital Statistics System and, therefore, was
independent of other NCHS data systems (e.g., National
Health Interview Survey, National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, National Hospital Discharge Survey,
National Nursing Home Survey, National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey, National Hospital Medical Care
Survey, and National Hospice and Home Care Survey). Data
for those systems have been age adjusted using a variety of
standard populations such as 1970 U.S. civilian
noninstitutionalized population and 1980 U.S. resident
population, which can be found in appendix II of Health,
United States, 1999.9 To improve comparability of age-
adjusted rates among data systems, these data for NCHS
surveys are being recalculated using the 2000 Standard
Population in Health, United States, 2000 and Health,
United States, 2001. In addition, beginning with 1999 data
for the Chronic Disease Indicators, CDC will be producing
age-adjusted data for States from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System using the 2000 Standard Population.
Calculation of Age-Adjustment
Weights: Background, Process, and
Procedures
The process of deriving age-adjustment weights for
survey and other population-based data began by identifying
age categories typically used for age adjustment and trying
to ensure that all the various groupings could be constructed
from a single ‘‘Master List’’ (table 1).
The source of the population figures in the Master List
is the official Bureau of the Census projections for the year
2000 published in Current Population Reports, series P-25,
no. 1130, table 210. It is the same publication on which the
standard population for mortality data is based.4 The Census
projections are disaggregated by sex and race. However,
only the totals for both sexes and all races combined were
used to develop the Master List. The complete 2000
population projections are available from the Bureau of the
Census web site at:
http://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1130/p251130.pdf.
The Master List, consisting of 24 age groups, was
developed to reduce discrepancies that can occur when
extracting and combining numbers from the published
Census projections. These projections for the 2000
population, both for single years of age and for 5-year age
groups, are rounded to thousands. However, population
counts for the 5-year age groups were calculated by
summing the unrounded counts for single years
(unpublished) and then rounding that sum. As a
consequence, published sums of the single years of age do
not necessarily add to the published 5-year totals, and
weights based on the published Census projections may be
slightly different depending on whether single-year or 5-year
age groups are combined to produce the weights. By
defining the Master List as the starting point for deriving
age-specific population estimates and age-adjustment
weights, such discrepancies are minimized. Once the Master
List was established, weights were computed for a number
of commonly used age distributions. The weight for a given
age group is the size of the corresponding age group in the
standard population divided by the total standard population
for all ages of interest.
Table 2 shows 22 different population age distributions
used in calculating baseline data from various major data
systems for the Healthy People 2010 objectives that use age
adjustment. Major data systems are those that are responsible
for tracking five or more Healthy People 2010 objectives.
Table A lists the distributions that were used by the major
data systems. Age Distributions #4 and #18 each appear in
two different data system groups. The specific groupings
used depend on the age groups covered by the objective and
on the number of events included in the measure used for
the objective. These groupings can be used as a general

must add to 1 (see ‘‘Calculation of Age-Adjustment Weights: Background, Process, and

 guide for researchers developing measures to track health
variables. The actual choice of age groupings to be used for
age adjusting, however, is an analytic decision and is, of
course, not limited to the age distributions shown in table 2.
When creating the 22 age distributions shown in table 2,
the age-specific population counts were constructed to be
consistent with the published Census projections. In some
cases, minor adjustments to the age-adjustment weights were
necessary for the weights to sum to one. With the exception
of Age Distribution #1 (described below), age-specific counts
for the age distributions shown in table 2 were derived
directly from the Master List (table 1). The total population
for each distribution was obtained by summing the
component age-specific population counts. Age-adjustment
weights for each of the age distributions were obtained by
dividing the age-specific counts by the total population over
all ages in that age distribution, rounding to six decimal
places, and making any necessary adjustments (where the
impact would be the least) so that the weights summed to 1
(rounded to six decimals places: 1.000000.) Note that
regardless of whether the age distribution covers all ages or
a subset of all ages (e.g., adults, children, elderly), the
weights are renormalized to always sum to 1.
Age Distribution #1, shown in table 2, consists of age
groups and age-adjustment weights previously published by
the NCHS Division of Vital Statistics and used for age
adjusting mortality statistics.4 An erratum sheet was
published that shows the weight for the 75–84 year-old
group as 0.044842, instead of 0.044841 initially printed. This
minor difference is an example of the adjustments that must
be made to the actual weight for the weights to sum to 1.
The actual calculated weight was 0.044841498, which when
rounded to six decimal places, was 0.044841. However,
using this weight, the sum of all of the weights fell short
of 1. After making a minor modification that increased the
weight to 0.044842, the age-adjustment weights summed
to 1.
A similar procedure was used to obtain the weights for
the five age distributions presented that required small
adjustments so that the weights summed to 1 (see table B.)
In all cases, the modification (either increasing or decreasing
the sixth decimal place so that the weights would sum to 1)
was made to the age group where the impact on the
age-adjustment calculation would be the least. No
modifications were required for any other age groups.
It should be noted that the number of age groups used
for age adjusting may have a small impact on the level of
the age-adjusted rate. For example, Age Distributions #8 and
#9 in table 2 are both for adults 18 years and older.
However, Age Distribution #9 uses five age groups
(providing more detail in the 25–44 year-old age group)
while Age Distribution #8 uses four age groups. Age
adjustment using one of these distributions would yield
slightly different estimates from the other.
In choosing the number of age groups for a specific
analysis, two competing interests need to be addressed. First,

 the more age groups utilized, the tighter the control of the
effect of the differences in the age distribution among groups
or time periods being compared. On the other hand, when
too many age groups are used and the data become sparse
for certain age groups, the resultant age-specific rates used in
the computation of the age-adjusted rate may have larger
variances. It should also be noted that the greater the
difference between the age distribution of the standard
population used to age adjust (in this case, the 2000
Standard Population) and the age distribution of the study
population, the greater the difference between the crude rate
and the age-adjusted rate for the study population. When the
age distribution of the standard population and the age
distribution of the study population are the same, the crude
rate is equal to the age-adjusted rate.
These 22 age distributions cannot cover all possible
situations that would require age adjustment. Analysts
desiring age breakouts not specified here can use the Master
List to generate other age distributions and their associated
age-adjustment weights. In some cases, the Master List may
not contain all of the age groups desired. Additional detail,
including age-sex-specific counts for use in age-sex
adjustment, is available from the original Census population
projections.10 When extracting additional subpopulations
from the Census projections, the new standard population
counts should be as consistent as possible with the Master
List, and the weights of the newly constructed age
distributions must sum to 1.
Age-Adjusted versus Crude Rates: Definitions
and Examples
Suppose that frequencies of the occurrence of a
characteristic (e.g., being a current cigarette smoker) have
been determined in each of several age groups for members
of a study population (e.g., 1997 U.S. population, ages 18
years and older). These are age-specific frequencies of the
characteristic (cigarette smoker). The age-specific rates of
the characteristic are the ratios of the age-specific
frequencies to the respective age-specific sizes of the study
population.
The crude rate of the characteristic is the total number
of occurrences of the characteristic (cigarette smoker) across
all age groups divided by the total study population (all
persons ages 18 years and older). Age-specific and crude
rates are often expressed as rates per 100 population
(percents) or as rates per 1,000 or 100,000 population.
Suppose that population sizes for the same age groups
have been obtained for a selected standard population. Then
the age-adjusted rate of the characteristic is simply a
weighted average of the age-specific rates. The weight for a
given age group is the size of the corresponding age group
in the standard population divided by the total standard
population for all ages of interest. The weights thus add to 1.
The age-adjusted rate has the advantage (over the crude rate)
of being controlled for age when compared to age-adjusted
rates for other study populations that have different age
structures. (Age-adjusted rates being compared must all be
based on the same standard population.)
To illustrate, suppose one wants to examine smoking
rates by level of education for people 18 years and older.
Because the age distributions of various education groups
differ, it is desirable to age adjust the rates to ensure that any
education differences that are observed are not confounded
by differences in the age structure of the various education
groups. In this example, each education group (e.g., less than
high school, high school graduate) is considered to be a
separate study population, and the smoking rate for each is
age adjusted. Examples of the calculation of age-adjusted
smoking prevalence rates by level of education are shown in
tables C and D. These tables illustrate two equivalent (except
for differences caused by rounding) methods for calculating
age-adjusted rates. Table C illustrates these calculations
using the actual age-specific population frequencies from the
2000 Standard Population Age Distribution #8 as weights.
Table D illustrates these calculations using age-adjustment
weights computed as the ratio of the age-specific population
frequencies in the Standard Population Age Distribution #8
to the total standard population in the age range covered.
The age-adjustment weights in table D were rounded to six
decimal places, but could have been rounded to any number
with the possibility of slightly different results. Notice that
the two methods yield identical results in percents shown to
two decimal places.
Application to Healthy People Objectives
Age adjustment was used for most of the Healthy
People 2000 objectives using mortality data, but only for a
few selected other objectives.5 In Healthy People 2010, age

 adjustment was also used for most of the objectives using
mortality data. However, the use of age adjustment was
expanded to include many other Healthy People 2010
objectives that measure health outcomes and risk factors. In
Healthy People 2010, age-adjusted data are shown for
objectives and population subgroups that include either all
ages or a wide range of ages. Objectives or population
subgroups that include groups with relatively narrow age
ranges (generally less than 40 years) are not adjusted.
For some population groups, age-adjusted rates are
considerably different from crude rates. This occurs because
the population distribution of the group is quite different

NOTE: For purposes of age adjusting, each education level can be considered a ‘‘study population.’’
1Excludes persons with unknown smoking status.
2Percents in this table should be entered into formulas as proportions, e.g., 24.7% = 0.247.
3Multiply the rate for each age-education-specific group (excluding 18 years and over) in column B by the standard population for the appropriate age group (column D) to get the age-adjusted
frequency for each age group (column E). The 18 years and over frequencies are the sums of the age-specifc frequencies.
4For each education level, sum the four age-adjusted frequencies (column E) to get the total age-adjusted frequency for ages 18 years and over. Divide that sum by the total standard population
18 years and over to get the age-adjusted rate for that education level and multiply by 100 to express the rate as a percent (column F).

NOTE: For purposes of age adjusting, each education level can be considered a ‘‘study population.’’
1Excludes persons with unknown smoking status.
2Percents in this table should be entered into formulas as proportions, e.g., 24.7% = .247.
3Multiply the rate for each age-education-specific group (excluding 18 years and over) in column B by the age-adjustment weight for the appropriate standard age group (column D) to get the
adjustment factor for each age group (column E). The 18 years and over age adjustment factors are the sums of the age-specific adjustment factors.
4For each education level, sum the four age-specific adjustment factors (column E) to get the total age-adjusted rate for that education level and multiply by 100 to express the rate as a percent
(column F).
5Includes persons with unknown education status.

 from the distribution of the standard population, which, for
Healthy People 2010, is based on the projected year 2000
population for the entire United States. For example,
age-adjusted rates in the Hispanic population (especially
Mexican Americans) for outcomes and behaviors that are
generally more frequent among the older population are
considerably higher than the corresponding crude rates. This
is a result of the Hispanic population’s much younger age
distribution than the standard population.
Age-adjusted baseline data are noted in Healthy
People 20106 and in Tracking Healthy People 201011
Part B: Operational Definitions. Tracking Healthy People
2010 also includes a detailed discussion of the
age-adjustment procedures and weights used for Healthy
People 2010.
All age-adjusted data for the Healthy People 2010
objectives are adjusted to the 2000 Standard Population,
although a number of different age distributions were used
for different objectives based on the data produced by
different data systems. The age distributions used for
Healthy People 2010 data were derived from a single
‘‘Master List’’ (see table 1) and are shown in table 2. A
listing of the age distributions used to calculate age-adjusted
rates for data from the major Healthy People 2010 data
systems is shown in table A.
Age Adjustment Using SUDAAN Software
When analyzing data from complex sample surveys
(e.g., National Health Interview Survey, National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey), the sample design must be
taken into account. SUDAAN, software for the statistical
analysis of correlated data, is often used to calculate
variance estimates for NCHS and other survey data.
SUDAAN is specifically designed for analysis of
cluster-correlated data from studies involving recurrent
events, longitudinal data, repeated measures, multivariate
outcomes, multistage sample designs, stratified designs,
unequally weighted data, and without-replacement samples.
SUDAAN fits marginal or population-averaged models using
generalized estimating equations (GEE). Robust variance
estimates are computed that fully account for intracluster
correlation, unequal weighting, stratification, and
without-replacement samples. This section provides
SUDAAN code that can be used to age adjust survey data.
More information on SUDAAN can be found at
http://www.rti.org/patents/sudaan/sudaan.html.
Either age-specific population frequencies or the
age-specific weights shown in table 2 (or derived from the
Master List) may be used as weights to produce age-
adjusted rates using SUDAAN’s PROC DESCRIPT
procedure. All of the calculations shown in tables C and D
can be accomplished with just two lines of SUDAAN code
added to the existing PROC DESCRIPT code.
Figure 1 shows PROC DESCRIPT code using standard
population Age Distribution #8 from table 2. The example
variable (AGEGRP8) is a recode based on all ages of
National Heath Interview Survey sample adults and consists
of the following four age categories: 18–24 years, 25–44
years, 45–64 years, and 65 years and over. The numbers
shown after the word STDWGT represent the number of
persons in each of these age categories in the 2000 Standard
Population, rounded to the nearest thousand. The age
groupings of AGEGRP8 and the age groupings of the
standard population (Age Distribution #8) must match.
SUDAAN uses the age-specific population frequencies to
calculate the age-adjustment weights and then produces an
age-adjusted rate for the total adult population, ages 18 and
older.
Figure 2 shows PROC DESCRIPT code using the same
variable as above (AGEGRP8) and the same four age
categories: 18–24 years, 25–44 years, 45–64 years, and 65
years and older. However, instead of the age-specific
standard population frequencies shown in the STDVAR
statement in figure 1, this version uses the age-adjustment
weights. These age-adjustment weights are the proportion
each group represents of the total standard population ages
18 and older (rounded to six decimals) and correspond to
the categories of the AGEGRP8 variable on the data
file (i.e., ages 18–24 (0.128810), ages 25–44 years
(0.401725), ages 45–64 (0.299194), and 65 years and
older (0.170271).
The standard population age groupings must match
those of the study population. For some survey data,

 adjustment to the total population (i.e., all ages) is
appropriate. In other cases, such as the example used here,
subsets of the all-ages population are the appropriate
standard (e.g., persons 18 years and older for the NHIS
Sample Adult questionnaire). It should be kept in mind that
in some cases, the 2000 Standard Population may not be the
most appropriate standard, such as in studies of populations
with very different age structures than the total U.S.
population. However, to the extent that analyses employ the
same standard population for age adjustment, it will be
possible to compare and interpret results across data systems
and across data years. Using age-adjustment standards other
than the 2000 Standard Population should be appropriately
justified.
