ABSTRACT
Background: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) risk allele (e4) is associ-
ated with higher total cholesterol (TC), amplified response to satu-
rated fatty acid (SFA) reduction, and increased cardiovascular disease.
Although knowledge of gene risk may enhance dietary change, it is
unclear whether e4 carriers would benefit from gene-based personal-
ized nutrition (PN).
Objectives: The aims of this study were to 1) investigate interac-
tions between APOE genotype and habitual dietary fat intake and
modulations of fat intake on metabolic outcomes; 2) determine
whether gene-based PN results in greater dietary change than do
standard dietary advice (level 0) and nongene-based PN (levels
1–2); and 3) assess the impact of knowledge of APOE risk (risk:
E4+, nonrisk: E42) on dietary change after gene-based PN (level 3).
Design: Individuals (n = 1466) recruited into the Food4Me pan-
European PN dietary intervention study were randomly assigned to
4 treatment arms and genotyped for APOE (rs429358 and rs7412).
Diet and dried blood spot TC and v-3 (n–3) index were determined
at baseline and after a 6-mo intervention. Data were analyzed with
the use of adjusted general linear models.
Results: Significantly higher TC concentrations were observed in
E4+ participants than in E42 (P , 0.05). Although there were no
significant differences in APOE response to gene-based PN (E4+
compared with E42), both groups had a greater reduction in SFA
(percentage of total energy) intake than at level 0 (mean 6 SD: E4+,
20.72% 6 0.35% compared with 21.95% 6 0.45%, P = 0.035;
E42, 20.31% 6 0.20% compared with 21.68% 6 0.35%, P =
0.029). Gene-based PN was associated with a smaller reduction in
SFA intake than in nongene-based PN (level 2) for E42 participants
(21.68% 6 0.35% compared with 22.56% 6 0.27%, P = 0.025).
Conclusions: The APOE e4 allele was associated with higher TC.
Although gene-based PN targeted to APOE was more effective in
reducing SFA intake than standard dietary advice, there was no differ-
ence between APOE “risk” and “nonrisk” groups. Furthermore, dis-
closure of APOE nonrisk may have weakened dietary response to PN.
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01530139.

INTRODUCTION
Coronary artery disease (CAD)15 is the leading cause of global
mortality, accounting for 1 of 5 deaths in Europe (1). Recent
estimates suggest that up to 80% of CHD and cerebrovascular
disease could be avoided by improving diet and lifestyle (2).

 Although intervention strategies traditionally have used a one-
size-fits-all approach to changing dietary behavior, evidence
suggests that a personalized approach may be more effective (3,
4). Moreover, there has been much interest in the use of genetic
information to tailor dietary advice, yet further randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) are needed to establish the benefit of such
advice on sustained dietary changes (5, 6). Of particular interest
in relation to CHD risk is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype.
The APOE gene is a key regulator of cholesterol and lipid
metabolism. APOE is polymorphic, with the common missense
polymorphisms (rs429358 and rs7412) resulting in 3 alleles, e2,
e3, and e4, combining to form 6 haplotypes, E2/E2, E2/E3, E2/
E4, E3/E3, E3/E4, and E4/E4. In a sample of 5805 Caucasians,
the APOE allele frequency for e2, e3, and e4 was 0.08, 0.77, and
0.15 respectively (7). The e4 allele is associated with increased
serum total cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol, as well as
coronary artery disease and mortality (8–12). Estimates of the
CHD HR for E4+ (E3/E4 and E4/E4), compared with E42 (E3/
E3), range from 1.06 to 1.42 (8, 9, 11, 13). There is also
a growing body of evidence showing that the APOE genotype
may influence lipid response to dietary fat; data from in-
tervention studies suggest that E4+ participants may be more
sensitive to dietary cholesterol, total fat, and, in particular, SFA
modulation (14, 15). Given their predisposition to CHD, e4
carriers might benefit from lower dietary SFAs and blood cho-
lesterol (16) and gene-based personalized nutrition (PN) inter-
vention. However, there is a concern that gene-based PN may
reduce motivation for dietary change in individuals without risky
genes and undermine current healthy eating messages (17).
The Food4Me study is a pan-European, 6-mo, Web-based RCT
designed to assess the impact of personalizing dietary advice
on change in dietary behavior. Participants were allocated to
1 of 4 intervention groups on the basis of standard guidelines
(level 0, control); dietary intake (level 1); dietary intake and
phenotype (level 2); and dietary intake, phenotype, and genotype
(level 3). Level 3 participants received feedback on 5 genes:
methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), fatty acid de-
saturase (FADS1), transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), fat
mass and obesity-associated (FTO), and APOE.
The aim of the present analysis was to 1) investigate inter-
actions between APOE genotype and habitual dietary fat intake
and modulations of fat intake on metabolic outcomes in the
Food4Me study; 2) assess whether gene-based PN led to greater
changes in diet than did standard dietary advice (control) and
nongene-based PN for E42 and E4+ participants; and 3) assess
the impact of knowledge of APOE risk on changes in diet and
metabolic outcomes after gene-based PN.
METHODS
The Food4Me proof-of-principle study (NCT01530139) is
a 6-mo randomized controlled dietary advice intervention
study conducted in 7 European research centers: University Col-
lege Dublin, Ireland; University of Reading, United Kingdom;
Maastricht University, Netherlands; University of Navarra, Spain;
Harokopio University, Greece; National Food and Nutrition In-
stitute, Poland; and Technische Universita
¨t Mu
¨nchen, Germany.
The study had a parallel design with 4 intervention arms and was
conducted via the Web to emulate a Web-delivered PN service
(www.food4me.org) (18). Ethics approval was granted at each
center and digital informed consent was obtained before partici-
pation. The study was developed while following international
regulations and the Helsinki Declaration.
Participants
A total of 1607 participants (aged $18 y) were recruited to the
Food4Me study, as detailed elsewhere (19). Exclusion criteria
were no or limited access to the Internet, following a medically
prescribed diet in the previous 3 mo, or presence of a condition
likely to alter dietary requirements, e.g., Crohn disease, celiac
disease, food allergy/intolerance, pregnancy, or lactation.
Study design
A randomization scheme that incorporated both sex and age
categories (,45 y and .45 y) was used to allocate participants
to 1 of the 4 Food4Me intervention groups, as follows—level 0:
standard nonpersonalized dietary and physical activity (PA)
advice; level 1: advice based on dietary intake and PA; level 2:
advice based on dietary intake, PA, and phenotype (blood bio-
markers); and level 3: advice based on dietary intake, PA,
phenotype, and genotype. Detailed recruitment and study pro-
cedures are reported elsewhere (19).
Interaction with study participants was conducted remotely
via the Food4Me website, by e-mail and post, with the use of
standardized operating procedures. A study welcome pack was
sent to the participants via post containing a dried blood spot
(DBS) collection kit (Vitas), an Isohelix SK-1 DNA buccal swab
kit (LCG Genomics), a TracmorD triaxial accelerometer (Philips
Consumer Lifestyle), measuring tape, and standardized instruc-
tions for completion of baseline measurements (month 0). On the
allocated study day and after an 8-h overnight fast, participants
collected DBS and buccal swab samples, and measured their
height, weight, and waist circumference. Questionnaires to be
completed on the same day included the validated Food4Me
food-frequency questionnaire (20, 21) and the validated Baecke
PA questionnaire (22–24). Participants repeated these measure-
ments, excluding the buccal cell sample, at 3 and 6 mo. The
TracmorD triaxial accelerometer (25) was worn for the entire
duration of the study, and data were uploaded on a biweekly basis.
Dietary feedback
After analysis of data collected at months 0 and 3, participants
received tailored dietary feedback (in their native language)
according to their study allocation group. The dietary feedback
provided was based on a predefined set of algorithms that incor-
porated dietary, anthropometric, PA, phenotypic, and genotypic
data when appropriate. The system was designed to ensure
consistent feedback across centers and has since been success-
fully automatized (26). APOE gene variants were coded as “risk”
[a genetic variation that can be modified by diet, i.e., E3/E4 or
E4/E4 (E4+)] or “nonrisk” [E2/E2, E2/E3, E3/E3 (E42)]. Along
with the risk result, level 3 participants received the following
basic information about the APOE genotype: “A specific variation
of this gene is associated with a greater need to maintain healthy
cholesterol concentrations. Decreasing saturated fat intake has
been associated with an improvement in cholesterol and factors
relating to cardiovascular health in these individuals.” For level 3
E4+ participants with high dietary SFA intake and/or high blood

 TC who were being advised to lower dietary SFAs, reference to
gene risk was also included in the advice message, i.e., “You have
a genetic variation that can benefit by keeping a healthy intake of
saturated fat and a normal level of blood cholesterol.”
Biochemical analysis
Participants were asked to complete 2 DBS cards, each
containing 5 blood spots, at months 0, 3, and 6 (w150 mL blood/
card). After the blood spots were dried at room temperature
for 2–4 h, the cards were placed in a sealed aluminum bag
(Whatman Foil Bags, item no. 10534321) containing a drying
sachet (Sorb-it, item no. 10548234; Su
¨d-Chemie) and posted
back to the research center in their country. Researchers sub-
sequently shipped the DBS cards to Vitas for analysis of whole-
blood TC (liquid chromatography–UV) and v-3 index [EPA
(20:5n–3) + DHA (22:6n–3)/total fatty acids) 3 100] (27). Fatty
acids were measured with the use of gas chromatography–flame
ionization detector.
DNA extraction and genotyping
Participants were instructed to rub the Isohelix SK-1 DNA
buccal swab against the inside of their cheek for 1 min before
returning it to a plastic tube containing an Isohelix Dri-Capsule.
On return to the center, swabs were shipped to LCG Genomics
for genotypic analysis. After DNA extraction, KASP genotyping
assays were used to provide biallelic scoring of polymorphisms
in the APOE gene (rs429358 and rs7412). Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium for multiple alleles was analyzed, with no significant
deviation observed for rs7412 (0.91; P = 1.00), whereas rs429358
displayed linkage disequilibrium (0.005; P = 0.008).
Statistical analyses
Data are presented as means 6 SEMs. Data were checked for
normality of distribution, and skewed variables were normalized
with the use of log10 (v-3 index) and square root (TC) transfor-
mations. General linear models (GLMs), adjusted for center,
sex, age, and BMI, were used to assess differences in baseline
anthropometric and biochemical values between genotype groups.
Habitual nutrient intake–gene interactions were assessed with the
use of the same GLM, but with the addition of a dietary fat 3
genotype interaction term; fat was dichotomized by median in-
take to assess the impact of the APOE genotype on TC and v-3
index in participants with a similar habitual intake. Post hoc
Bonferroni tests were used to detect specific differences between
groups.
Interactions between genotype and dietary fat on TC and v-3
index after dietary advice intervention were assessed by measuring
percentage change in dietary fat intake, with 0% used as a refer-
ence to dichotomize participants (i.e., reduction compared with
increase in fat intake), and then using the resulting groups as fixed
factors in the GLM. The interaction term genotype 3 change in fat
was then added to the GLM, with the change in biomarker as the
response variable and the respective preintervention/baseline bio-
marker value as a covariate. The model was adjusted for baseline
variables, age, sex, center, and weight change [postintervention
weight (kilograms) – preintervention weight (kilograms)].
The impact of knowledge of APOE risk (risk: E4+, E3/E4, and
E4/E4; and nonrisk: E42, E2/E2, E2/E3, and E3/E3) on change
in diet and TC and v-3 index (month 6 2 month 0) for level 3
participants advised to lower their SFAs at baseline (with high
dietary SFAs and/or high blood TC) was assessed with the use of
GLMs. Models were adjusted for baseline variables, age, sex,
center, and weight change. To assess whether gene-based PN led
to greater changes in diet, TC, and v-3 index (month 6 2 month
0) than did standard dietary advice (level 0) and nongene-based
PN (levels 1–2), a contrast analysis was performed. Separate
analyses were conducted for E4+ (risk) and E42 (nonrisk), with
level 3 as the reference group and levels 0, 1, and 2 as the
comparison groups. As previously, participants with high dietary
SFAs and/or high blood TC who were advised to lower their
SFAs at baseline were included and analyses were adjusted for
baseline variables, age, sex, center, and weight change. Statis-
tical analyses were performed with the use of Stata version 13.0.
RESULTS
Subject characteristics
A total of 1466 of the 1607 participants randomly assigned to
the Food4Me study were genotyped for APOE and included in
the baseline analysis. Frequency of APOE genotype and APOE
allele according to Food4Me country are presented in Table 1.
APOE E2/E4 participants (n = 27) were removed from subse-
quent analysis because of their low population frequency. Sub-
ject characteristics, including anthropometric measurements and
fasting biomarkers, are presented according to APOE genotype
in Table 2. There was no evidence of a genotype-dependent
difference in baseline anthropometric measurements, although
E4+ participants had higher TC than did E42 subjects (P =
0.040 for E3/E3 and P = 0.002 for E2 carriers).
Habitual dietary and genotype effects at baseline
The associations between dietary fat (total fat, SFAs, MUFAs,
PUFAs, and v-3), APOE genotype, dietary fat 3 genotype inter-
actions, and TC and v-3 index are reported in Table 3. Dietary
intake was dichotomized at the median (total fat, 35.8%; SFAs,
14.0%; MUFAs, 13.5%; PUFAs, 5.6; and v-3, 0.67%) to deter-
mine the effect of specific genotypes in participants with similar
habitual dietary fat intake; this is presented in Table 3 according
to genotype group.
An independent effect of genotype was observed for dietary
fat and TC concentrations at baseline (total fat, P = 0.002; SFAs,
P = 0.002; MUFAs, P = 0.002; PUFAs, P = 0.003; and v-3, P =
0.004), with the highest TC concentrations seen in carriers of the
e4 allele (E4+). Overall diet effects (SFAs, P = 0.008; MUFAs,
P = 0.025; PUFAs, P = 0.007; and v-3, P , 0.001) were obser-
ved for the v-3 index, with lower dietary SFAs (11.7% 6 0.1%)
and higher PUFAs (6.80% 6 0.05%) and v-3 (0.89% 6 0.01%)
fat intake associated with a higher v-3 index. Although a sig-
nificant MUFA 3 APOE interaction was observed for the v-3
index (P = 0.025), no differences between genotype groups and
fat intake were observed after post hoc analyses.

 in fat 3 APOE interactions on TC and v-3 index after intervention
(month 6 2 month 0) are reported in Table 4. Dietary intake was
split into participants who reduced fat intake and those who in-
creased fat intake. Mean reductions and increases in dietary fat
intake are presented according to genotype group.
There was a significant impact of genotype on change in TC
concentrations after dietary advice intervention (total fat, P =
0.016; SFAs, P = 0.025; MUFAs, P = 0.019; PUFAs, P = 0.024;
and v-3, P = 0.027). There were no independent effects of diet on
lipid biomarkers after dietary advice intervention, although trends
were observed for change in PUFA (P = 0.068) and v-3 fat (P =
0.087) intake on v-3 index. A trend was also observed for an v-3
fat intake 3 APOE interaction on v-3 index (P = 0.087).
Effect of knowledge of APOE gene risk on dietary change
compared with other levels of personalization
The allocation of APOE risk according to intervention level is
shown in Figure 1. Participants (levels 1–3) advised to lower
dietary SFAs at baseline were selected for subsequent analysis.
The effects of knowledge of APOE risk (E4+) in participants
advised to reduce SFA intake at baseline on changes in diet,
TC, and v-3 index (month 6 2 month 0) compared with other
levels of personalization are reported in Table 5. A significantly
greater reduction in total fat and SFAs [percentage of total en-
ergy (%TE)] was observed in E4+ participants receiving gene-
based PN (level 3) than in those in the control group (P = 0.034
and P = 0.035, respectively). However, there were no differences
in change in diet or biomarkers between personalized inter-
vention groups.
The effects of knowledge of APOE nonrisk (E42) in partici-
pants advised to reduce SFA intake at baseline on changes in diet,
TC, and v-3 index (month 6 2 month 0) compared with other
levels of personalization are reported in Table 6. As previously,
participants receiving gene-based PN had a significantly greater
reduction in dietary SFAs (%TE) than did those in the control
group (P = 0.029). For total fat, a slight increase in intake was
observed for the control group (level 0) compared with a reduction

reduction in SFAs (%TE) was observed in E42 participants who
received nongene-based PN (level 2; PN based on diet and
phenotype) than in those E42 participants receiving gene-based
PN (P = 0.025). There were no significant differences between
change in total fat, PUFAs, MUFAs, v-3, carbohydrate, and
protein intake and TC and v-3 index for E42 carriers according
to whether they received gene-based or nongene-based PN
(level 3 compared with levels 1–2).
Effect of knowledge of APOE genotype on dietary change
after gene-based PN
The effect of knowledge of APOE risk (risk: E4+, E3/E4, and
E4/E4, and nonrisk: E42, E2/E2, E2/E3, and E3/E3) in partic-
ipants advised to reduce SFA intake at baseline on changes in
diet, TC, and v-3 index (month 6 2 month 0) after gene-based
PN (L3) are reported in Table 7. Approximately 30% of E42
participants who received gene-based PN were advised to lower
their SFA intake at baseline compared with 53% of E4+ carriers
(Figure 1). After intervention, there were no significant differ-
ences in dietary response or change in biomarker between E4+
and E42 participants.
DISCUSSION
Key findings in the present analysis included higher TC
concentrations in E4 carriers (E4+) and a nutrient intake–gene
interaction between APOE genotype and MUFA intake for v-3
index at baseline. After intervention, gene-based PN resulted in
significantly greater reductions in total fat and SFAs (%TE) than
did standard dietary advice (control), irrespective of gene risk.
For E42 (nonrisk) participants advised to lower SFA intake,
gene-based PN resulted in smaller changes in dietary SFA intake
at month 6 than did nongene-based PN (level 2).
Although the APOE rs429358 distribution was not in Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium, the haplotype frequencies observed in the
Food4Me cohort (e2, 6.5; e3, 79.3; e4, 14.2) were similar to those

 reported in previous studies of European populations (28). In
contrast to previous observations (29, 30), there was no clear
geographic cline in e4 frequency.
DBS TC differed according to APOE genotype, with signif-
icantly higher TC observed in E4+ participants than in E42
subjects. With respect to the difference in TC between E4+ and
E42 subjects, E3/E3 in the present study (0.15 mmol/L) was
similar to previous data (0.16–0.36 mmol/L) in a large meta-
analysis of 54,377 participants (31).
At baseline, there was a significant nutrient intake–gene in-
teraction between total MUFA intake and APOE on long-chain
v-3 index, a reliable biomarker of v-3 status, and dietary v-3
PUFA, EPA, and DHA intake (32, 33). Furthermore, there is
a dose-dependent inverse association between v-3 index and
CHD mortality (33), with an index $8% offering the most
cardioprotective effects and an index #4% being associated
with the greatest risk of CHD mortality (27). Thus, the v-3
index may be a risk factor for CHD (34). In the Food4Me study,
a higher v-3 index was associated with lower SFA and higher
PUFA and dietary v-3 intake. In a study investigating the
determinants of v-3 index in a Mediterranean population, there
were significant associations between EPA and DHA intake and
v-3 index (P , 0.001) and a trend for an inverse association
between dietary SFAs and v-3 index (P = 0.095) (35).
It has been suggested that gene-based dietary information is
more understandable and useful than general dietary guidelines
(36), and may enhance motivation to change (37). In a 2010
systematic review, a beneficial effect of genome-based risk es-
timates on dietary behavior was reported (2 RCTs, pooled OR:
2.24; 95% CI: 1.17, 4.27; P = 0.01; I2 = 0%), but no benefit of
genome-based risk estimates on intention to change dietary
behavior was observed (5). Furthermore, in a Canadian RCT,
knowledge of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene risk
resulted in a significantly greater reduction in sodium intake
than with nongene-based advice (2287 6 114 compared with
130 6 118 mg/d, P = 0.008) at a 12-mo follow-up (38). Change
in sodium intake by participants carrying the nonrisk ACE ge-
notype (2244 mg/d) was not significantly different (P = 0.11)
from the control group. In our present study, gene-based PN
promoted significantly greater reductions in the intake of total

 fat and SFAs than standard dietary advice (control), for both risk
(E4+) and nonrisk (E42) participants advised to lower SFAs.
However, there were no significant differences in change of diet,
TC, or v-3 index between APOE risk groups (E4+ and E42)
receiving gene-based PN. In the REVEAL (Risk Evaluation and
Education for Alzheimer’s Disease) study, which investigated
the impact of knowledge of Alzheimer disease risk (estimated
with the use of APOE genotype and family history to generate
a numerical risk) on dietary behaviors, E4+ participants were
significantly more likely to endorse Alzheimer disease–specific
health behavior change than E42 participants at a 12-mo follow-
up (39). A similar result was observed in a study that investi-
gated the impact of knowledge of FTO genotype on readiness
to control weight, in which individuals with higher risk (AA or
AT) displayed greater willingness to change than those with
lower risk (TT) (P = 0.051) (40).
Although there was no additional benefit of gene-based PN for
E4+ participants in the Food4Me study, knowledge of nonrisk

APOE RESPONSE TO PERSONALIZED DIET INTERVENTION

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/104/3/827/4668568 by guest on 02 June 2019
 (E42) resulted in a lower reduction in SFA intake at 6 mo than in
E42 participants receiving nongene-based PN (level 2) who were
not informed of their APOE risk (21.68% compared with 22.56%).
Providing no-risk genotypic results may reduce motivation to follow
dietary advice (41). A potential reason for the lack of response in
Food4Me E4 carriers is the absence of a specific behavioral change
technique (BCT) involving information on the consequences of
a specific behavior related to genotype. A key BCT in the Coventry,
Aberdeen, and London—Refined taxonomy (a 40-item taxonomy to
improve PA and healthy eating behaviors) is to “provide information
of the consequences of the behavior to the individual.” In the context
of APOE genotype, a consequence of carrying the e4 allele would be
increased cardiovascular disease risk (31), and the corresponding
risk-reducing behavior would be lowered SFA intake. In the present
study, the APOE risk information conveyed to participants was
framed positively, i.e., “you have a genetic variation that can benefit
by keeping a healthy intake of saturated fat and a normal level of
blood cholesterol.” The lack of an explicit link to an adverse con-
sequence of E4+ status, e.g., higher cardiovascular disease risk, may
have reduced the efficacy of this advice. In the REVEAL study,
participants were informed that the E4 allele was associated with an
increased risk of Alzheimer disease before gene disclosure (39).
Although genotypic testing for polygenic disease risk may result in
a fatalistic attitude (37), information on consequences of personal
characteristics (e.g., genotype) and fear arousal can be useful aids in
enhancing behavior change (42). In a meta-analysis of fear arousal
techniques, stronger fear messages promoted greater intention and
behavior change in public health campaigns, provided that the threat
was perceived to be severe and personally relevant, and that indi-
viduals could take specific action to mitigate their risks (43). In
a Finnish RCT, knowledge of personal APOE risk resulted in greater
short-term improvements in dietary quality, waist circumference,
and serum triglyceride when participants were informed of the link
between dietary fat, cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease risk in an
oral communication session (44). Furthermore, E4+ individuals
significantly improved fat quality at 6 mo (P , 0.01), whereas there
was no difference in fat quality in the E42 or control groups (44).
A limitation of Internet-delivered PN (as used in our Food4Me
study) is the reduced opportunity to use BCT in response to verbal
and nonverbal cues (e.g., body-language and facial expressions).
Recent focus group data also revealed a lack of understanding in
consumers of the use of genetic information to tailor dietary
advice, and opinions regarding gene-based PN were mostly
negative (45). Given that understanding and knowledge of spe-
cific gene-based PN advice was not evaluated in the Food4Me
study, it is not possible to ascertain whether this contributed to the
lack of effect observed. The Food4Me study was designed to
assess the impact of 3 levels of personalization on dietary change,
and was not specifically targeted to the APOE genotype. Fur-
thermore, although participants were informed that they had
a risky gene variant that would benefit from dietary change,
advice was not stratified according to specific genotype groups
(e.g., differing advice for E2/E3 and E3/E3). Strengths of this
study include making use of the Internet to assess and deliver
dietary advice, prospective genotyping, a larger sample size than
reported previously (39, 44, 46), the measurement of actual dietary

 change as distinct from intention to change, and the availability of
relevant blood-based biomarkers of fat status (obtained from un-
supervised sampling). As such, the Food4Me study provides robust
evidence of the impact of knowledge of APOE risk on adherence
to dietary advice.
In conclusion, APOE status was significantly associated with
TC at baseline, with highest concentrations in E4+ participants.
Whereas gene-based PN targeted to APOE was more effective
in reducing SFA intake than standard dietary advice, there was
no added benefit of knowledge of APOE risk on dietary change.
Furthermore, it appears that disclosure of genotypic nonrisk status
may have weakened the dietary response to PN. Future research
should explore ways in which this detrimental response to gene-
based PN can be mitigated.
