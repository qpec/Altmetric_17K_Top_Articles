IMPORTANCE Primary care offers an important and underutilized setting to deliver treatment
for opioid and/or alcohol use disorders (OAUD). Collaborative care (CC) is effective but has
not been tested for OAUD.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether CC for OAUD improves delivery of evidence-based treat-
ments for OAUD and increases self-reported abstinence compared with usual primary care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial of 377 primary care patients
with OAUD was conducted in 2 clinics in a federally qualified health center. Participants were
recruited from June 3, 2014, to January 15, 2016, and followed for 6 months.
INTERVENTIONS Of the 377 participants, 187 were randomized to CC and 190 were
randomized to usual care; 77 (20.4%) of the participants were female, of whom 39 (20.9%)
were randomized to CC and 38 (20.0%) were randomized to UC. The mean (SD) age of all
respondents at baseline was 42 (12.0) years, 41 (11.7) years for the CC group, and 43 (12.2)
years for the UC group. Collaborative care was a system-level intervention, designed to
increase the delivery of either a 6-session brief psychotherapy treatment and/or
medication-assisted treatment with either sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone for opioid use
disorders or long-acting injectable naltrexone for alcohol use disorders. Usual care
participants were told that the clinic provided OAUD treatment and given a number for
appointment scheduling and list of community referrals.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were use of any evidence-based
treatment for OAUD and self-reported abstinence from opioids or alcohol at 6 months. The
secondary outcomes included the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)
initiation and engagement measures, abstinence from other substances, heavy drinking,
health-related quality of life, and consequences from OAUD.
RESULTS At 6 months, the proportion of participants who received any OAUD treatment was
higher in the CC group compared with usual care (73 [39.0%] vs 32 [16.8%]; logistic model
adjusted OR, 3.97; 95% CI, 2.32-6.79; P < .001). A higher proportion of CC participants
reported abstinence from opioids or alcohol at 6 months (32.8% vs 22.3%); after linear
probability model adjustment for covariates (β = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01-0.23; P = .03). In
secondary analyses, the proportion meeting the HEDIS initiation and engagement measures
was also higher among CC participants (initiation, 31.6% vs 13.7%; adjusted OR, 3.54; 95% CI,
2.02-6.20; P < .001; engagement, 15.5% vs 4.2%; adjusted OR, 5.89; 95% CI, 2.43-14.32;
P < .001) as was abstinence from opioids, cocaine, methamphetamines, marijuana, and any
alcohol (26.3% vs 15.6%; effect estimate, β = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.23; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with OAUD in primary care, the SUMMIT
collaborative care intervention resulted in significantly more access to treatment and
abstinence from alcohol and drugs at 6 months, than usual care.

ortality rates are rising from increases in drug over-
doses,suicides,andalcohol-relatedliverdisease,1yet
substance use disorders (SUDs) continue to be un-
deridentified and undertreated.2-6 The consequences of this
unmet need are great, including increased risk of disease, in-
jury, disability and death, and large social and health care
costs.7-10 Opioid and alcohol use disorders (OAUD) are of par-
ticular concern owing to their high rates of morbidity and
mortality11-14 and the increasing prevalence of prescription
opioid misuse.15 Research supports the effectiveness of treat-
ment for OAUD16-20 but few individuals receive treatment.
Addressing this need has numerous potential benefits.21
Although treatment in specialty settings is important for
individuals with severe dependence, limited availability and
stigma mean that specialty care alone is insufficient to ad-
dress treatment needs.22-24 Primary care offers an important
and underutilized setting for OAUD treatment. Recent fed-
eral legislation25,26 has increased coverage for SUD treatment
and the prevalence of OAUD is high in primary care.27,28 Opi-
oid and alcohol use disorders have standards for care and, un-
likeotherSUDs,canbetreatedwithmedications,makingthem
appropriate for treatment in primary care.16-20
Collaborative care (CC) is an effective strategy for increas-
ing the delivery of evidence-based treatment and improving
outcomes,29 but, to our knowledge, has not been tested for
OAUD. A previous trial failed to find an effect of chronic care
management on SUD outcomes.30 Collaborative care is based
on principles of the chronic care model31,32 and involves inte-
grating behavioral health into primary care. We conducted a
randomized clinical trial to determine whether a community
health clinic-based CC intervention would improve patient use
of evidence-based treatments for OAUD and increase self-
reported abstinence. We hypothesized that patients random-
ized to the CC condition33 would have: (1) increased use of a
6-session brief psychotherapy treatment (BT) based on moti-
vational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy
approaches34and/ormedication-assistedtreatment(MAT)with
either sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) for
opioid use disorders or long-acting injectable naltrexone
(XR-NTX) for alcohol use disorders35; and (2) increased past-
30-day abstinence from opioids or alcohol at 6 months.
Methods
Study Design
The Substance Use Motivation and Medication Integrated
Treatment (SUMMIT) study was a randomized clinical trial
comparing the effect of CC vs usual care on primary care-
based OAUD treatment utilization and self-reported absti-
nence. The study was approved by the RAND institutional re-
view board on April 26, 2012. See the Supplement for the Trial
Protocol.
Participants
We partnered with a multisite Federally Qualified Health Cen-
ter (FQHC)36 located in Los Angeles, California that provides
on-site behavioral health care for depression and anxiety dis-
orders. Of 114 512 patients seen each year, 58% are of His-
panic origin, and 11% are African-American; clinicians in-
clude internists, family practitioners, physician assistants, and
nurse practitioners. Participants were recruited between June
3, 2014 and January 15, 2016 from the FQHC’
s 2 largest clini-
cal sites. During the study’
s design, a power analysis deter-
mined that a sample of 400 participants would allow estima-
tion of small to medium effect sizes.
All patients attending a primary care visit with a clinician
were screened by a medical assistant for substance use in the
past 3 months using a 3-question screener based on the Na-
tional Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) quick screen.37 Con-
senting patients who screened positive for risky use were re-
ferred for assessment by the research team. Inclusion criteria
were (1) age 18 years or older; (2) probable OAUD diagnosis
based on the NIDA-modified Alcohol, Smoking and
Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST); (3) English
or Spanish-speaking; (4) willing to switch therapists if al-
ready receiving therapy at the clinic. Exclusion criteria were
(1) marked functional impairment from bipolar disorder or
schizophrenia38,39; (2) current abstinence from alcohol and/or
opioids in the previous 30 days; and (3) current substance use
treatment. Participants gave written informed consent and
were compensated for research activities ($5 for eligibility
screener, $50 for baseline assessment, $50 for follow-up
assessment).
Assessment at Baseline
The baseline interview assessed demographics; homeless sta-
tus; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(Fourth Edition) diagnosis of alcohol, heroin, and prescrip-
tion opioid abuse or dependence using the Comprehensive In-
ternational Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), version 3.0,40,41 past

or more ethanol drinks in a day for women and 5 or more for
men); consequences of alcohol or opioid use using the Short

Key Points
Question Does collaborative care for opioid and alcohol use
disorders increase treatment use and self-reported abstinence
compared with usual primary care?
Findings Results from this randomized clinical trial found that,
relative to usual care, the collaborative care intervention increased
both the proportion of primary care patients receiving
evidence-based treatment for opioid and alcohol use disorders
and the number achieving abstinence from opioids or alcohol use
at 6 months.
Meaning Effective treatment for opioid and alcohol use disorders
can be integrated into primary care using a collaborative care
intervention and results in improved patient outcomes.

 life using the SF-12 Health Survey47,48 (SF-12 mental compo-
nent summary [MCS] and physical component summary [PCS]
scores; range of 0-100); emergency department or overnight
hospital stay in past 90 days; and self-reported receipt of life-
time and past year SUD treatment.
Randomization Procedures
We used an R software (version 3, R Project) random number
generator to randomly assign eligible participants to either CC
or usual care. We used a concealed randomization protocol
where neither participant nor researcher was aware of the ran-
domization until after the baseline interview. None of the par-
ticipants or clinicians was blinded to treatment allocation
after randomization.
Participant Assessment at Follow-up
A follow-up assessment using a subset of questions from base-
line was conducted by telephone 6 months after the baseline
interview. Interviewers were blinded to treatment alloca-
tion. The last participant follow-up interview was conducted
in September, 2016.
Collaborative Care and Usual Care
The CC intervention33,49 included a population-based man-
agement approach, measurement-based care, and integra-
tion of addiction expertise through a RAND-based clinical psy-
chologistaffiliatedwiththeMotivationalInterviewingNetwork
of Trainers. Care coordinators met with patients who had posi-
tive screening results and who were randomized to CC to as-
sess motivation and encourage patients to meet with a thera-
pistforevaluationandtreatmentplanning.AllCCpatientswere
entered into a registry that tracked treatment progress and
prompted care coordinators to reach out to patients with
missed visits. Care coordinators conducted regular assess-
ments of substance use; results were entered into the registry
and reviewed during team meetings. Participants in usual care
were told by the research team that the clinic provided OAUD
treatment, and given a number for appointment scheduling
and list of community referrals. They did not receive any ad-
ditional outreach or contact.
The 2 clinical sites employed 7 therapists who had coun-
selling or social work masters’degrees. None had expertise in
addiction treatment. All therapists received a 1-hour over-
view of the BT manuals; 5 were randomized to the CC condi-
tion and received an additional 2 days of BT training. Care co-
ordinators had a high school degree and received 2 days of
motivational interviewing training; each had worked at the
clinic for more than 15 years. Clinicians were not random-
ized; all 28 were offered MAT training; 24 received XR-NTX
training and 18 received training on BUP/NX (7 nonphysi-
cians were not eligible to be waivered and 3 physicians were
not trained). Twelve clinicians received their Drug Enforce-
mentAgencywaivertoprescribeBUP/NX.Patientswhowanted
MAT but whose clinician had not been trained or who were in-
eligiblewerereferredtoawaiveredclinician.Allclinicianswere
employed by the FQHC; pharmacotherapy consultation was
provided by a board-certified addiction medicine physician af-
filiated with a local academic medical center. Weekly team
meetings and group supervision for the care coordinators and
therapists in the CC condition were led by the clinical psy-
chologist. All BT sessions were audiotaped and uploaded to a
secure site for review during clinical supervision.
Outcomes
There were 2 primary outcomes: use of any evidence-based
OAUD treatment (BT or MAT) during the 6-month study pe-
riod, and self-reported 30-day abstinence from all opioids or
any alcohol at 6 months.42 The BT and MAT visit data were ob-
tained from electronic medical record administrative files;
XR-NTX use data were obtained from a pharmacy log; and
BUP/NX use data were obtained from medical chart review of
electronic medical record notes; we were unable to confirm
whether patients filled the BUP/NX prescriptions. Visit data
from administrative files were cross-referenced with medical
chart review data for all patients and BT audio files for accu-
racy. Secondary outcomes included Healthcare Effectiveness
Data and Information Set (HEDIS) initiation and engagement
measures,50,5130-dayabstinencefromanyalcoholandalldrugs
(including opioids, methamphetamine, cocaine, and mari-
juana), consequences from opioid and alcohol use, health-
related quality of life, and any heavy drinking days.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted descriptive analyses to test the balance be-
tweenCCandusualcaregroupcharacteristicsatbaselineusing
aχ2testforcategoricalvariablesandattestforcontinuousvari-
ables. Multivariable analyses controlled for characteristics that
significantlydifferedbetweenthe2groupsatanαlevelof0.20.
We conducted all evaluations as intent-to-treat analyses.
We conducted multivariable logistic regression to test the hy-
pothesis that CC increased utilization of OAUD treatment. All
patient outcome analyses were weighted to represent the
sample of patients recruited through randomization, using a
raking algorithm in SAS (RAkinge).52-54 Because only pa-
tients who were currently using alcohol and/or opioids at base-
line qualified for the study, for our primary outcome of absti-

and relevant covariates. We conducted multivariable linear re-

Results
Enrollment and Follow-up
There were 15 723 unique adult primary care visits in the
study period. Based on a predetermined sample of weekly
screening audits, 94% to 98% of the visits were screened
(approximately 15 000) by the medical assistants, 5% were
eligible for referral, and 745 were referred to the study. Of
those, 738 were assessed for eligibility (Figure), 452 were eli-
gible, and 397 were randomized. Postrandomization, 20
were excluded after reporting either being in treatment or
being abstinent in the 30 days prior to the assessment, leav-
ing 377 in the analysis of outcomes (187 in CC and 190 in UC).
Of these, 261 (69%) were interviewed at 6 months and
included in analysis of patient outcomes. The 2 groups were
comparable with respect to observed characteristics at base-
line, with no differences at P < .05 (Table 1): 203 (54%) had
only alcohol abuse or dependence, 115 (31%) abused or were
dependent on heroin with or without cooccurring alcohol or
prescription opioid abuse or dependence, and 59 (16%) had
prescription opioid abuse or dependence with or without
cooccurring alcohol abuse or dependence. One hundred
eighty six (49.3%) were homeless.
Delivery of Collaborative Care Intervention
Of 187 individuals randomized to CC, 184 were entered into
the registry, 171 (93%) met with the care coordinator, 143
(76%) scheduled an appointment with a CC therapist, 65
(45%) kept the appointment (number derived from patient
registry and includes individuals subsequently excluded
from the service system outcome analysis), and 37 had at
least 1 additional psychotherapy session. Sixteen of the 24
clinicians who were trained prescribed XR-NTX and 11 of the
12 waivered prescribers prescribed BUP/NX; overall 17 of 28
(61%) prescribed MAT.
Treatment Utilization Outcomes
Treatment utilization models were adjusted for age, race,
heroin abuse or dependence, and clinic enrollment site. At 6
months, the proportion of participants who had received any
evidence-based OAUD treatment was higher in the CC group
compared with usual care (39.0% vs 16.8%; adjusted OR, 3.97;
95% CI, 2.32-6.79; P < .001) (Table 2). In secondary analyses,
theproportionofparticipantsreceivinganyBT,butnotthepro-
portion receiving any MAT, was higher in the CC group com-
pared with usual care (35.8% vs 10.5%; adjusted OR, 6.22; 95%
CI, 3.36-11.52; P < .001; 13.4% vs 12,6%; adjusted OR, 1.23; 95%
CI,0.64-2.38).TheproportionmeetingtheHEDISinitiationand
engagement measures was also higher in the CC group than
inusualcare(initiation,31.6%vs13.7%;adjustedOR,3.54;95%
CI, 2.02-6.20; P < .001; engagement, 15.5% vs 4.2%; adjusted
OR, 5.89; 95% CI, 2.43-14.32; P < .001).
Participant Outcomes
At 6 months, the proportion of participants abstinent from all
opioids or any alcohol was 10.5 percentage points higher in the
CC group compared with usual care (32.8 vs 22.3 percentage
points) (Table 3). After adjustment for covariates, abstinence
remained higher by 12 percentage points in the CC group (ef-
fect estimate, β = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01-0.23; P = .03). Only 1 of
the 7 secondary outcomes—abstinence from opioids, co-
caine, methamphetamines, marijuana, and any alcohol—
showed a significant improvement in the CC group, (26.3% vs
15.6%; effect estimate, β = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.23; P = .01). Pa-
tient outcome models were adjusted for age, race, receipt of
SUD treatment in the previous 12 months, and clinic enroll-
ment site.
Discussion
We found that a CC intervention implemented in a multisite
FQHC increased both the proportion of primary care patients
receiving evidence-based treatment for OAUD, and the num-
ber achieving self-reported abstinence from opioids or alco-
hol use at 6 months, compared with usual care. Among indi-
viduals with SUDs, abstinence is linked to a decreased

better long-term outcomes.60,61 In secondary analyses, CC in-
creased the proportion of patients meeting the HEDIS initia-
tion and engagement measures, the proportion receiving psy-
chotherapy,andthenumberreportingabstinencefromalcohol
and other drugs. The HEDIS initiation and engagement mea-
sures have been associated with lower mortality, fewer ar-
rests, and improvements in employment and drug and
alcohol use.62-65 Collaborative Care did not increase use of
MAT, reduce levels of heavy drinking, significantly improve
health-related quality of life, or reduce problems from drugs
and alcohol. Our results suggest that a CC intervention for
adults with OAUD in community health clinics is feasible
and effective.
Opioid and/or alcohol use disorders are 2 of the most
prevalent and problematic SUDs with high unmet need.
Among our sample both severity and unmet need were
high, with over one-quarter having been hospitalized for
their OAUD use; only 209 (58.1%) had previously discussed
substance use with a professional; and only 50 (13.3%) had
received any treatment during the prior 12 months. In addi-
tion, with nearly half the sample homeless at the time of
enrollment, our study included a population with special
challenges to engage and treat successfully.66,67
To our knowledge, this is the first study to implement and
test CC for OAUD in a community clinic setting. Our interven-
tion differed from previous studies to increase treatment for
OAUD in several important ways, which may have contributed
to our results.30,68 We recruited participants when they pre-
sented to their regular clinician, rather than through residen-
tial detoxification services, advertisements, or community
referrals.30 Treatment for OAUD was delivered by participants’

 primary care clinician or by behavioral health professionals
integrated with the clinic rather than through a specialty ad-
diction medicine clinic or specialty care. Using participants’
usual care clinicians may have increased participant motiva-
tionordecreasedstigma,leadingtobetteroutcomes.Itmayhave
also reduced barriers to treatment utilization.
Although results favored CC, receipt of evidence-based
treatment was still relatively low (73 [39%]) and only 25 (13%)
of CC participants received MAT. It is not clear whether the low
rate of MAT is related to clinician supply or patient demand.
Of the 28 clinicians at the 2 clinics, 17 (61%) prescribed MAT,
suggesting that clinicians integrated MAT treatment into their
practice and the organization had increased its capacity to pro-
vide MAT. However, clinicians did not regularly participate in
the team meetings attended by the care coordinators, thera-
pists, and addiction specialists, citing a lack of protected time.
The low rates of treatment and MAT specifically may also be
owingtopatientsnotidentifyingashavinganOAUD,sincemost
accessed primary care for reasons perceived as unrelated to
substance use. Population-based data suggest that over 90%
of individuals with substance use disorders do not perceive a
need for treatment.69 Given this, BT may have been seen as a
more acceptable initial treatment option.
Strengths and Limitations
Ourstudyhasseveralstrengths.Thestudypopulationwaseth-
nically and racially diverse, and the FQHC served a low-
income population. Existing staff were trained to deliver the
intervention and treatment. This approach supports the in-
tervention’
s feasibility and long-term sustainability, and its
transportabilitytoothersimilarFQHCs.Screeningateveryvisit
and use of the registry facilitated population-based manage-
ment; regular symptom assessment facilitated measurement-
based care. It is notable that in both groups we observed in-
creased abstinence, which may speak to the power of the
primary care relationship.
There were also limitations. The study took place at an
FQHC with integrated behavioral health. Thus, results may
not generalize to other types of settings. By design, the clin-
ics undertook a year-long effort to prepare to provide OAUD
treatment before the trial, which may limit dissemination.
However, to the extent that this preparation phase may have
biased results, it would be toward the null hypothesis. We
assessed patient outcomes by self-report, because biological
tests are inadequate for detecting 30-day opioid and alcohol
use. Although we used validated tools, social desirability
bias may have influenced CC participants to report absti-
nence more than participants receiving usual care. We had
differential retention, and individuals lost to follow-up may
have had worse outcomes than those for whom we have out-
come data. There was also no follow-up after 6 months, and
we do not know if the effect was sustained. Finally, patient-
level vs clinic-level randomization may have increased the
likelihood of spillover, but to the extent that this occurred it
would have weakened statistical power to detect differences
between groups.
Conclusions
Among adults with OAUDs seen in primary care, the SUMMIT
intervention resulted in significantly more evidence-based
treatment and abstinence from alcohol and drugs at 6 months,
compared with usual care. These findings suggest that treat-
ment for OAUDs can be integrated into primary care, and that
primary care-based treatment is effective for OAUDs.

Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Some of the
authors are employees of The RAND Corporation
(“RAND”), a nonprofit institution that helps improve
policy and decision making through research and
analysis. Within the past three years, RAND has
received funding for research projects from
Alkermes plc (Alkermes) relating to the
pharmaceutical Vivitrol, which is manufactured and
sold by Alkermes. Dr Watkins participated in RAND
research projects funded by Alkermes and served
as a principal investigator. Dr Ober participated in
RAND research projects funded by Alkermes. To the
extent this paper suggests benefits to patients who
received any evidence-based practice, which
includes Vivitrol, this finding may have a positive
financial effect on Alkermes. Prior to submission,
RAND conducted additional internal quality reviews
of this article with a particular focus on the
possibility of bias. Dr Pincus reported serving on
committees without compensation for the National
Quality Forum, National Committee on Quality
Assurance, American Psychiatric Association, and
the National Academy of Medicine. Dr Pincus has
had research support from the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration.
Dr Heinzerling reported receiving research funding
from Alkermes (different funding than was
provided for SUMMIT), as well as from Gilead and
Medicinova (which are also unrelated to SUMMIT),
and has received small honoraria from Reckitt
Benkiser (maker of Suboxone). No other disclosures
were reported.
Funding/Support: This research was funded by
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
R01DA034266 (PI: Watkins).
Role of the Funder/Sponsor: The National
Institute on Drug Abuse had no role in design and
conduct of the study; collection, management,
analysis, and interpretation of the data; and
preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript
or the decision to submit for publication. Alkermes
provided long-acting injectable naltrexone at no
charge to patients with alcohol use disorders who
were prescribed the medication by their primary
care physician. This arrangement was disclosed and
approved by the National Institutes of Health
project officer, as well as to the RAND Human
Subjects Protection Committee.
