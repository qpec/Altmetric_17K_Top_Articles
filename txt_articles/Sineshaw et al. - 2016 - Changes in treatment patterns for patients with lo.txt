BACKGROUND: In the United States, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) is widely accepted as the standard of care in the
treatment of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. In the current study, the authors attempted to examine patterns of treat-
ment in the United States over the past decade. METHODS: Using the National Cancer Data Base, a total of 66,197 patients who were
diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II to III rectal adenocarcinoma and treated between 2004 and 2012 were
identified. The authors described trends in the receipt of treatment for 3 time periods (2004-2006, 2007-2009, and 2010-2012) and
analyzed 5-year overall survival probabilities for 28,550 patients treated between 2004 and 2007. RESULTS: Receipt of NACRT
increased significantly from 42.9% between 2004 and 2006 to 50.0% between 2007 and 2009, and to 55.0% between 2010 and
2012 (P <.0001). In contrast, the use of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) decreased from 16.7% between 2004 and 2006 to 10.5%
between 2007 and 2009, and to 6.7% between 2010 and 2012 (P <.0001). Similarly, the use of surgery alone decreased from 13.1%
between 2004 and 2006 to 8.7% between 2010 and 2012 (P <.0001). Older age, the presence of comorbidities, larger primary tumor
size, lymph node involvement, not being of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, lack of private insurance, and treatment at a facility
that did not have a high case volume were associated with a significantly lower possibility of receiving NACRT. The 5-year overall sur-
vival rates for patients treated with NACRT, surgery and adjuvant CRT, surgery alone, and definitive CRT were 72.4%, 70.9%, 44.9%,
and 48.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of NACRT before surgery in US patients with rectal cancer has substantially
increased over the past decade. However, only approximately one-half of patients currently receive this standard therapy, which could
be explained in part by socioeconomic factors. Trimodality therapy is associated with the best outcomes for these patients. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Rectal cancer is a common disease in the United States, with an estimated 40,000 new cases expected to have been diag-
nosed in 2015,1 and a worrisome increase in incidence rates in the younger population.2 The management of rectal cancer
has become more complex, with a greater chance of variation by patient-associated, physician-associated, and treatment
facility-associated factors.3,4 Trimodality therapy, incorporating total mesorectal excision (TME), pelvic radiotherapy
(RT), and systemic chemotherapy, is an established treatment paradigm for patients with American Joint Committee on
Cancer stage II and III rectal adenocarcinoma, based on several randomized clinical trials.5,6 A previous analysis of the
National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) regarding the patterns of care in the United States7 encompassed the period between
1985 and 1995 and revealed a dramatic increase in the receipt of trimodality therapy: from 9.5% between 1985 and 1986
to 31% between 1989 and 1990, and again to 46% between 1994 and 1995. This trend was based, in part, on a National
Cancer Institute consensus statement that was published in 1990.8 In addition, the publication of the phase 3 randomized
trial of the German Rectal Cancer Study Group in 20049 established neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) followed
by TME as a standard of care in the United States, based on improvements in local control, decreased toxicity, and a

comparison with TME followed by adjuvant chemoradio-
therapy (CRT). In the current study, we examined con-
temporary patterns of and factors associated with the
receipt of NACRT in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The NCDB, which is jointly sponsored by the American
College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer and the
American Cancer Society, is a hospital-based registry that
serves as a comprehensive clinical surveillance resource
that derives its data from approximately 1500 Commis-
sion on Cancer–accredited programs in the United States.
As such, the NCDB captures approximately 70% of inci-
dent cancers in the United States each year, making it one
of the most powerful and generalizable cancer databases in
the world.10 Ongoing validation of the accuracy and qual-
ity of the NCDB data is performed through internal mon-
itoring, site surveys, and data quality reviews.11 Data
coding methods have been described previously.12
We extracted data regarding patients aged >18 years
who were diagnosed with a single primary or first primary
American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II to III rectal
adenocarcinoma and received all or part of their treatment
at an accredited NCDB facility between January 1, 2004
and December 31, 2012. Rectal carcinoma cases include
cancers topographically coded as C20.9, according to the
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd
Edition (ICD-O-3).13 Treatment of all cases was analyzed
using the clinical stage of disease (pathologic stage was
used if the clinical stage was missing) at the time of diag-
nosis. Management strategies for rectal carcinoma include
surgery, chemotherapy, RT, and combinations of these
modalities. Disease histology was limited to rectal adeno-
carcinomas (ICD-0-3 histology codes 8140, 8210, 8260-
63, 8470, 8480, and 8481), including adenocarcinoma,
not otherwise specified; adenocarcinoma in adenomatous
polyps; papillary adenocarcinoma, not otherwise speci-
fied; villous adenocarcinoma; adenocarcinoma in tubulo-
villous adenoma; mucinous adenocarcinoma; and mucin-
producing adenocarcinoma. Tumors recorded as other
carcinomas or with unspecified histology codes were
excluded from the current analysis. Information retrieved
included type of surgery, patient age, patient sex, patient
race (categorized as non-Hispanic [NH] white, NH black,
Hispanic, or other/missing data/unknown), patient insur-
ance (private, Medicaid, Medicare, uninsured, or other/
missing data), facility type, facility volume (tertiles of
facility case volume were ranked into low, medium, and
high case volumes by counting the number of cases treated
at the facility), educational attainment (defined as the per-
centage of residents per ZIP code without a high school
diploma), date of diagnosis, date of surgery, date chemo-
therapy was initiated, date RT was initiated, receipt of
chemotherapy, receipt of RT, number of RT fractions,
lymph node status, tumor grade, tumor size, and comor-
bidity score. We defined adjuvant therapy as when treat-
ment was administered within 6 months after surgical
resection, and also defined neoadjuvant therapy as when
treatment was administered within 6 months before surgi-
cal resection. Receipt of NACRT and adjuvant CRT were
categorized based on receipt of chemotherapy and RT
within the specified time frame. For the trend analysis, all
patients were grouped according to predetermined time
periods of diagnosis: 2004 to 2006, 2007 to 2009, and
2010 to 2012. For 5-year survival analysis, data were lim-
ited to cancer diagnoses made between 2004 and 2007.
Statistical Analysis
We used SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Insti-
tute Inc, Cary, NC) to perform the statistical analysis. We
performed descriptive analysis to demonstrate patterns of
NACRT using chi-square tests to test significance for cat-
egorical variables and the Cochran-Armitage test for trend
to determine trends over time in the use of NACRT for 3
time periods (2004-2006, 2007-2009, and 2010-2012).
Variables likely to be associated with the receipt of preop-
erative treatment and the type of preoperative treatment
were included in the multivariable logistic regression
model. All-cause, unadjusted, 5-year survival rates were
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Follow-up
time for calculating survival rates was from the date of
diagnosis until the date the study ended (December 31,
2012), last contact date, or death (whichever occurred
first). Cox proportional hazards models were used to esti-
mate the 5-year risk of all-cause mortality and to identify
independent predictors of survival. The proportional haz-
ards assumption test did not show violations for variables
included in the model. Statistical significance was consid-
ered when the 2-sided P value was < .05.
RESULTS
Patient Demographics
We identified 68,182 patients in the NCDB who received a
diagnosis of stage II or III rectal cancer between 2004 and
2012. No significant differences were evident with regard to
the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the
patients (age, ethnicity, comorbidity score, insurance,

 income, or education) among the 3 diagnosis periods
(Table 1). The majority of patients (>70%) diagnosed with
locally advanced rectal cancer were aged 50 to 79 years, and
the vast majority had excellent performance status with a
comorbidity score (Charlson/Deyo) of 0.
Tumor Characteristics
Overall, the quality of documentation of tumor character-
istics was good, with no apparent changes between 2004
and 2012. Approximately 10% of patients were missing
information regarding tumor grade and 20% were miss-
ing information regarding tumor size. No significant
changes in tumor characteristics were observed among the
3 diagnosis-year cohorts (Table 1), and there was a nearly
equal split between patients with stage II and stage III
disease at the time of diagnosis.
Patterns of Treatment
The majority of patients were treated at comprehensive
community cancer programs, and the percentage of
patients treated at facilities with low case volumes substan-
tially decreased from 12.3% between 2004 and 2006 to
6.8% between 2010 and 2102 (Table 2). Of the patients
who underwent surgery, few received local excision. The
percentage of patients who underwent surgery alone for
stage II or III rectal cancer declined from 13.1% between
2004 and 2006 to 8.7% between 2010 and 2012, whereas
the percentage of patients who received treatment with de-
finitive CRT and did not undergo surgery increased from
9.4% to 12.3% during these same time periods. The
receipt of adjuvant CRT appears to have steadily declined
from 16.7% between 2004 and 2006 to 10.5% between
2007 and 2009 to 6.7% between 2010 and 2012, whereas
receipt of NACRT increased from 42.9% to 50.6% and
then to 55% over the 3 time periods (P for trend < .0001)
(Fig. 1). Less than 1% of patients received short-course
RT, defined as 5 sessions. The majority of patients
received standard fractionation RT (between 25 and 33
fractions).
Factors Associated With Receipt of NACRT
Patients who were diagnosed with more advanced disease
(larger tumors and involved pelvic lymph nodes) were
more likely to undergo either surgery alone or surgery fol-
lowed by adjuvant CRT and less likely to receive
NACRT. Patients treated at facilities that did not have a
high case volume (as defined earlier) were less likely to
receive NACRT. Several social factors were found to be
associated with a lower likelihood of receiving NACRT:
nonwhite ethnicity, lack of private medical insurance, and
residing in a neighborhood with a low educational back-
ground (Table 3).
Survival Outcomes
A total of 28,550 patients diagnosed with stage II or III
rectal cancer between 2004 and 2007 were analyzed for
5-year survival outcomes. The 5-year unadjusted overall
survival (OS) rate was 72.4%, 70.9%, 44.9%, and 48.8%,
respectively, among patients who received NACRT, adju-
vant CRT, surgery alone, and definitive CRT (Fig. 2).
When compared with patients who received NACRT, the
adjusted hazard ratio for risk of death at 5 years was 1.66
(95% confidence interval, 1.56-1.77) for surgery alone
and 1.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.37-1.59) for defini-
tive CRT (Table 4). Black race, older age at the time of
diagnosis, high tumor grade, increased tumor size,
involved lymph nodes, higher comorbidity score, treat-
ment facilities that did not have a high case volume, non-
private insurance, and lower median income were found
to be associated with a higher risk of death at 5 years after
treatment for stage II or III rectal cancer.
DISCUSSION
The treatment paradigm for locally advanced rectal cancer
has been shifting continuously over the past 30 years to
incorporate 3 treatment modalities (surgery, chemother-
apy, and RT) to achieve best treatment outcomes. An ear-
lier report concerning patterns of care for rectal cancer in
the United States based on an analysis of NCDB data
revealed the receipt of trimodality therapy (with no infor-
mation regarding the sequencing of these modalities) in
9.5% of patients with stage II or III rectal cancer between
1985 and 1986, which increased to 31% between 1989
and 1990 and further increased to 46% between 1994
and 1995 (calculated from Table 4 in Jessup et al7). This
trend could be attributed in part to the publication of the
National Cancer Institute consensus statement in 1990.8
We extended this analysis through 2012 and demonstrated
that the percentage of US patients receiving trimodality
therapy (either NACRT followed by surgery or surgery
followed by adjuvant CRT) has been steady at approxi-
mately 60% over the past decade. We also demonstrated
that, in keeping with several randomized clinical trials, the
use of trimodality therapy is associated with the best OS
rate of >70%.
A randomized trial of NACRT versus adjuvant CRT,
published in 2004, established NACRT as a standard of care
in Europe and North America. Although there was no sur-
vival difference noted, NACRT led to improved local con-
trol, decreased severe acute and long-term treatment-related

 toxicities, and possibly improved the rate of sphincter preser-
vation, in comparison with adjuvant CRT.9 Over the past
decade, since the publication of the randomized trial by the
German Rectal Cancer Study Group,9 we have observed an
increase in the rate of adoption of NACRT in the manage-
ment of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer in the
United States, with the parallel decrease in the use of adjuvant
CRT. Unfortunately, with only 55% of US patients receiving
the standard of treatment in recent years, one must address
the gap between the guidelines and the variable penetrance
into routine clinical practice. The results of the current study
indicate that facilities with low or medium case volumes are
less likely to offer patients the standard treatment, and that
socioeconomic factors such as not being of NH white race/
ethnicity, a lack of private insurance, and residence in a neigh-
borhood with a lower educational background are independ-
ent factors associated with a lower probability of receiving the
standard national guidelines-supported therapies.
The standard trimodality therapy in the United
States involves a fractionated RT treatment course over 5
weeks with concurrent chemotherapy, followed by sur-
gery. This treatment paradigm is costly for the health care
system to support. Conversely, short-course RT of 25 Gy
delivered in 5 fractions followed by immediate surgery,
without concurrent chemotherapy, has a long history of
evaluation in Europe. Recently, 2 randomized trials com-
pared long-course CRT with short-course RT. A Polish
randomized trial demonstrated no benefit from the long-

 given within a span of 1 week. This is in stark contrast to
Sweden, where approximately 80% of patients were
reported to receive short-course RT and only 20% of
patients received long-course CRT, based on a recent
analysis of the Swedish National Patient Register.16
Because access to health care, such as the availability of
transportation, and treatment costs prevent US patients
from receiving the standard trimodality therapy,17,18
short-course neoadjuvant RT should be strongly consid-
ered as a reasonable and evidence-based alternative. In
general, as the debate over the cost-effectiveness of oncol-
ogy care in the United States continues, many health care
systems are searching for ways to minimize expensive
treatments in areas in which clinical evidence exists to sup-
port the alternative, less costly treatment approaches.
The NCDB is a comprehensive national oncologic
database with detailed information available regarding soci-
odemographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics.19 Sev-
eral comparison studies have documented the validity of
NCDB-based analysis.20,21 However, the current study has
several limitations. Despite the fact that the clinical and de-
mographic characteristics of patients in the NCDB have
been shown to be similar to those of patients in the
population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results database,22 the NCDB remains a hospital-based

 cancer registries database and the results may not be general-
izable to the US population. There could be underreporting
of the receipt of chemotherapy and RT because these thera-
pies could be administered in the outpatient setting. The
NCDB does not collect information regarding provider/
patient preferences and individual socioeconomic factors,
which could influence receipt of treatment. Finally, an
unadjusted all-cause mortality was used for survival out-
comes because the NCDB does not collect cancer-specific
mortality, which may not be reflective of treatment effec-
tiveness but rather dependent on patient selection.
Conclusions
In a large national database, the results of the current
study demonstrated that the use of NACRT before sur-
gery in US patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal
cancer has substantially increased over the past decade.
However, only approximately one-half of these patients
currently receive the standard therapy as recommended by
national guidelines, which in part could be explained by
socioeconomic barriers. Trimodality therapy is associated
with the best outcomes for these patients, and surgery
alone or definitive CRT should only be reserved for
patients who are unable to tolerate trimodality therapy, or
for carefully selected patients taking part in clinical trials.
