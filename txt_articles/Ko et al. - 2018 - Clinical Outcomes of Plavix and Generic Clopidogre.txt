ORIGINAL ARTICLE
BACKGROUND: Clopidogrel is one of the most commonly prescribed 
medications because of its ability to improve clinical outcomes for a broad 
range of cardiovascular conditions. After patent protection expired for 
Plavix in 2012, many healthcare systems adopted generic clopidogrel as a 
strategy to reduce healthcare costs.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a population-based 
observational study to determine whether generic clopidogrel was 
noninferior to Plavix. Patients who were hospitalized with an acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS) from 2009 to 2014 in Ontario, Canada, >65 
years, survived ≥7 days after discharge, were eligible for inclusion. The 
primary outcome was a composite of death and recurrent ACS at 1 year. 
The noninferiority margin was prespecified at a relative hazard difference 
of 10%. Inverse propensity of treatment weighting of the propensity 
score was used to account for differences in baseline characteristics 
between the treatment groups. The effect of clopidogrel on the hazard of 
clinical outcomes was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model 
within the propensity-weighted cohort using Plavix as a reference. Our 
study included 24 
530 patients with ACS, 12 
643 were prescribed Plavix 
and 11  
887 were prescribed generic clopidogrel at hospital discharge. The 
mean age was 77 years, 57% were men, and 21% had an ST-segment–
elevation myocardial infarction. At 1 year, 17.6% of patients prescribed 
Plavix and 17.9% of patients prescribed clopidogrel experienced the 
primary outcome (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–1.08; 
P=0.005 for noninferiority). No significant differences between rates of 
death, all-cause readmission, ACS, stroke or transient ischemic attack, or 
bleeding were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Generic clopidogrel was noninferior to Plavix with 
respect to the composite end point of death and recurrent hospitalization 
for ACS at 1 year among adults >65 years after an ACS hospitalization. 
Our findings support generic clopidogrel in ACS, which could lead to 
substantial healthcare cost savings.

lopidogrel, a thienopyridine derivative that inhib-
its the P2Y12 platelet receptor, is one of the most 
commonly prescribed drugs in cardiology given 
its ability to improve clinical outcomes for patients with 
an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), percutaneous coro-
nary intervention (PCI), stroke, and peripheral vascular 
disease.1–4 Marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Plavix was 
one of the best-selling drugs in the world with reported 
sales of $9.8 billion in 2011.5 After patent protection 
for Plavix expired in 2012, many jurisdictions around 
the world elected to substitute Plavix with generic clopi-
dogrel to reduce healthcare costs.6 In the United States 
and Canada, the process of approving generic medica-
tions is less demanding than for new drug approvals 
because the demonstration of bioequivalence among 
patients with cardiovascular conditions or showing 
equivalence of clinical outcomes is not required for ge-
neric drug approval.5,7,8 Instead, generic drugs are ap-
proved on the basis of demonstrating bioequivalence 
of brand and generic medications in healthy volunteers 
(minimum of 12 subjects).5,7,8
However, bioequivalence in healthy volunteers may 
not translate into clinical bioequivalence. Indeed, sev-
eral reports have suggested significantly higher platelet 
reactivity for generic clopidogrel compared with Plavix 
among patients with ACS or ST-segment–elevation 
myocardial infarction.9,10 In addition, a single-center 
study observed a 2.7-fold increase rate of stent throm-
bosis, temporally related to the introduction of generic 
clopidogrel.11 Despite concerns about whether generic 
clopidogrel can provide similar clinical benefits as com-
pared with Plavix, there is currently no mechanism to 
track the long-term safety profile of generic medica-
tions in clinical practice. Given these uncertainties and 
the paucity of long-term clinical data, we sought to 
evaluate the clinical outcomes of Plavix versus generic 
clopidogrel for patients recently hospitalized with an 
ACS, a patient subset that is at high risk of adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes. The Ontario drug policy that 
mandates universal substitution of generic medications 
afforded a unique opportunity to perform a compara-
tive effectiveness study in the entire population and 
with minimal concerns for selection bias.
METHODS
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be 
made available to other researchers for purposes of reproduc-
ing the results or replicating the procedure because of the 
privacy rules of data of Ontario.
System Context
The Canadian health insurance system provides free universal 
coverage for all essential hospital and ambulatory medical ser-
vices. The Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) program is a government-
funded program that covers outpatient drug costs for all Ontario 
residents aged ≥65 years.12,13 Brand name medications are auto-
matically substituted by generic medications when they become 
available. Patients can elect to stay on the brand name medica-
tions by paying the difference in medication cost. Prasugrel and 
ticagrelor were added to the ODB formulary on February 2012 
and April 2013, respectively. These medications were approved 
under the limited-use program and are reimbursed for patients 
only with specific indications, such as stent thrombosis, failed 
aspirin and clopidogrel, or other high-risk features.14
Design and Data Sources
We conducted an observational study using multiple large 
population-based databases in Ontario, Canada. Our data 
sources have been described in detail elsewhere with further 
information available on our study website (www.canheart.
ca).15,16 Specific data sources essential to this current study 
included (1) the Ontario Registered Persons Database, a reg-
istry of all Ontario residents with health insurance coverage; 
(2) the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge 
Abstract Database that was used to identify prior cardiac risk 
factors, comorbidities, and repeat hospitalizations; (3) the 
ODB prescription database that was used to determine out-
patient prescription drug use for patients ≥65 years, includ-
ing number of prescriptions, and cost of medications; and 
(4) Statistics Canada database to capture the median neigh-
borhood income of patients. These data sources have been 
used extensively by our group for cardiovascular outcomes 
research.15,16 They were linked using unique encoded iden-
tifiers and analyzed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative 
Sciences to protect patient confidentiality.
Study Sample
Patients >65 years and <105 years of age, surviving at least 7 
days after an ACS hospitalization from April 1, 2009, to March 
31, 2014, in Ontario, Canada, were eligible for inclusion. ACS 
hospitalization was identified using International Classification of 
Disease, 10th Revision codes I20, I21, I22, I24.0, I24.8, and I24.9 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Plavix was once the most commonly prescribed 
cardiac medication.
• Patent protection expired for Plavix in 2012.
• Many healthcare systems adopted generic clopi-
dogrel as a strategy to reduce healthcare costs.
• Concerns remain because generic drugs are 
approved on the basis of bioequivalence and have 
not demonstrated similar clinical benefits.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• This is a large population-based study to evalu-
ate the safety and effectiveness of generic clopi-
dogrel, utilizing a noninferiority design with 
propensity-weighted analysis.
• Generic clopidogrel was noninferior to Plavix in 
older patients with acute coronary syndrome.
• The results support the use of generic clopidogrel 
in acute coronary syndrome.

in the Discharge Abstract Database.17 We excluded patients who 
had an invalid Ontario health insurance card number, had ACS 
secondary to an in-hospital complication, or those hospitalized 
with ACS in the year before the index event. For patients who 
had multiple ACS admissions during the study period, the first 
ACS hospitalization was considered as the index event.
Plavix and Generic Clopidogrel
We categorized patients into 2 exposure groups based on 
Plavix or generic clopidogrel prescription within 7 days of dis-
charge from ACS. Mandatory generic automatic substitution 
policy for Plavix to generic clopidogrel occurred in December 
2011 in Ontario, Canada. To avoid including patients who 
were prescribed both Plavix and clopidogrel after an ACS, we 
excluded patients who were hospitalized in the period before 
policy change from January 2011 to December 2011.
There were 15 generic clopidogrel preparations that 
were available during the study period (Abbott-Clopidogrel, 
Accel-Clopidogrel, 
Apo-Clopidogrel, 
Auro-Clopidogrel, 
Co-Clopidogrel, Dom-Clopidogrel, Jamp-Clopidogrel, Mar-
Clopidogrel, Mint-Clopidogrel, Mylan-Clopidogrel, PMS-
Clopidogrel, Q-Clopidogrel, Ran-Clopidogrel, Riva-Clopidogrel, 
Sandoz-Clopidogrel, Teva-Clopidogrel). In our main analyses, 
all of the generic formulations were grouped into a single 
generic clopidogrel group.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of our study was a composite of all-
cause death and recurrent hospitalization for ACS within 1 
year. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, all-
cause hospitalization, ACS, stroke or transient ischemic attack 
(TIA), and bleeding as individual end points. Ascertainment of 
outcomes began from 7 days post-ACS discharge to the first 
of the following events: the event of interest, switch from 
brand to generic (or vice versa), or 1-year postindex date. 
Death was determined from the Ontario Registered Persons 
Database. Recurrent ACS hospitalization and secondary out-
comes were identified using the Discharge Abstract Database 
with International Classification of Disease codes.17
Statistical Analysis
We hypothesized that generic clopidogrel would be inferior 
as compared with Plavix with a hazard ratio (HR) margin of 
1.10 for the primary outcome.18 We estimated that ≈10 
000 
patients in each treatment group would be needed to provide 
a power of at least 90% on the assumption of a true HR of 
1.0 with a target α of 0.025. Because our hypothesis was that 
generic clopidogrel is inferior to Plavix, a significant P value for 
our primary outcome indicates that the null hypothesis was 
rejected, and evidence for noninferiority was achieved.
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients pre-
scribed Plavix and generic clopidogrel were compared using χ2 
tests for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test 
for continuous variables. To adjust for potential confounding 
between the treatment groups, we used the inverse probability 
of treatment weighting using the propensity score to account 
for observed systematic differences in baseline covariates.19,20 
The propensity score, which was defined as the probability of 
receiving generic clopidogrel, was estimated with multiple 
logistic regression analysis, including the following character-
istics, which were selected on the basis of clinical knowledge: 
demographics (age, sex, income, and rural residence), admis-
sion characteristics (unstable angina, myocardial infarction, 
and ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction), prior cardiac 
comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, 
unstable angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial 
arrhythmia, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, 
shock, and coronary revascularization), prior medical comorbidi-
ties (renal disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
liver disease, peptic ulcer disease, anemia, and history of bleed-
ing), cardiac medication use, in-hospital cardiac invasive proce-
dure use, physician characteristics (physician volume, specialty), 
and hospital characteristics (teaching, cardiac invasive capacity).
Patients were then weighted by the inverse of the prob-
ability of receiving the treatment that they actually received. 
Balance of baseline covariates between the treatment groups 
in the weighted cohort was assessed by computing weighted 
standardized differences, with differences of <0.1 indicat-
ing good balance.19,20 We also plotted the distribution of the 
propensity score before and after to weighting to assess the 
degree of overlap between the 2 exposure groups. Adjusted 
Kaplan–Meier survival curves were estimated for treated and 
untreated subjects separately in the weighted sample using a 
method described by Cole and Hernán.21 The effect of clopi-
dogrel on the hazard of clinical outcomes was then estimated 
using a Cox proportional hazards model in which the hazard 
of the outcome was regressed on the receipt of Plavix as the 
reference. The inverse probability treatment weights were incor-
porated and a robust variance estimator was used.19,20 We also 
compared Plavix versus generic clopidogrel in the following pre-
defined subgroups: age (<75, ≥75 years), sex (male, female), 
prior diabetes mellitus, most responsible diagnosis (myocardial 
infarction or unstable angina), and prior stroke or TIA, and PCI 
procedures during hospitalization. This was achieved by examin-
ing the interaction between treatment status and the subgroup 
variables of interest within the propensity-weighted cohort.
To evaluate potential heterogeneity of the effects of dif-
ferent generic clopidogrel preparations, we compared the pri-
mary outcomes of each clopidogrel preparation with Plavix as 
a reference. Because Apo-clopidogrel was the most common 
formulation in Ontario, we also performed an additional anal-
ysis by combining the non–Apo-clopidogrel formulations into 
a single group and compared it with Plavix. Given the fact that 
propensity analyses are not suited for multiple comparisons, 
this additional analysis was performed in the nonpropensity-
weighted cohort using Cox proportion hazard models and 
adjusted for variables as previously described. SAS version 9.3 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to conduct statistical analy-
ses. A 2-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
This study was approved by the institutional review board at 
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Canada.

016 received a new prescription of Plavix or 
generic clopidogrel within 7 days of hospital discharge. 
We excluded 179 patients who died or were rehospital-
ized for an ACS within 7 days, 16 patients who were 
prescribed both Plavix and clopidogrel, and 115 patients 
who had <1 year of follow-up. After excluding patients 
who were hospitalized from January 1, 2011, to Decem-
ber 31, 2011, our study cohort included 24 
530 patients, 
of whom 12 
643 received Plavix and 11 
887 received 
generic clopidogrel. Patients who were prescribed pra-
sugrel (21 patients) and ticagrelor (1245 patients) dur-
ing the study period were not included in our study.
Characteristics of the Study Population 
Before Propensity Weighting
Table I in the Data Supplement shows the baseline 
characteristics of patients prescribed Plavix and gener-
ic clopidogrel before inverse probability of treatment 
weighting. Patients prescribed Plavix were slightly 
younger (76.9 versus 77.4 years) but had slightly more 
comorbidities, such as previous history of atrial arrhyth-
mia, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, myocar-
dial infarction, cerebrovascular and renal disease, com-
pared with the generic clopidogrel group. All patients 
between 2009 and 2011 were dispensed Plavix while 
≈95% of patients with ACS after 2012 were dispensed 
generic clopidogrel after the automatic generic substi-
tution policy (Figure I in the Data Supplement).
Characteristics of the Study Population 
After Propensity Weighting
The baseline characteristics, treatment, physician, and 
hospital characteristics after inverse probability treat-
ment weighting are shown in Table 1. All the charac-
teristics in the Plavix and the generic clopidogrel groups 
were well balanced, with standardized differences <0.1 
between the 2 groups. The distribution of the propen-
sity score showed almost complete overlap after pro-
pensity weighting (Figure II in the Data Supplement).
The mean age of our study cohort after propensity 
weighting was 77 years, 57% were men, 39% had a 
history of diabetes mellitus, and 21% presented with 
an ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (Table 1). 
Statins were dispensed in 91% of patients, angiotensin-
converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor blockers in 82%, 
and β-blockers in 78% within a week after hospital dis-
charge. Cardiac catheterization was performed in 72% of 
patients, and among them 53% received PCI procedures.
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
At 1 year, the rate of the composite end point of death 
or recurrent ACS hospitalization in the propensity score 
treatment weighting adjusted population was 17.6% in 
the Plavix group and 17.9% in the generic clopidogrel 
group (HR, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–1.08; 
noninferiority P=0.005; Table 2; Figure 2). There was no 
significant difference in 1-year mortality among patients 
prescribed Plavix and generic clopidogrel (10.5% versus 
11.2%; HR, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.99–1.15). 
Similarly, no significant difference between rates of ACS 
hospitalization, stroke or TIA, bleeding, or all-cause hos-
pitalization was observed (Table 2).
Subgroup Analysis
We performed subgroup analyses to investigate the 
potential difference in clinical outcomes between Plavix

and clopidogrel among predefined subgroups based on 
age, sex, diabetes mellitus status, most responsible diag-
nosis, and prior stroke or TIA, and PCIs during hospital-
ization. All the subgroups showed no significant differ-
ence in primary outcomes between treatment groups, 
and no significant interactions were observed (Table 3).
Individual Generic Clopidogrel 
Formulation
Of the 11 
887 patients who received generic clopido-
grel, 81.8% received APO-clopidogrel, followed by 
Teva-Clopidogrel at 6.1%, Co-Clopidogrel at 4.7%, 
and Mylan-Clopidogrel at 4.3%. All the other formula-
tion each had <2.5% of the overall generic clopidogrel 
use. Although we observed no significant difference in 
the primary outcome between Plavix and each generic 
clopidogrel formulation, many HRs had wide confidence 
intervals because of small sample sizes. There was also 
no significant difference comparing the primary outcome 
between non–Apo-clopidogrel with Plavix (Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
Ontario’s policy of automatically switching brand 
name medications with generic medications afford-
ed a unique opportunity for us to conduct a natural 
experiment to compare the clinical efficacy and safety 
of Plavix and generic clopidogrel in a large popula-

tion of hospitalized patients with ACS. We found that 
many forms of generic clopidogrel were, in aggregate, 
noninferior to Plavix with respect to the composite end 
point of death and recurrent hospitalization for ACS 
at 1 year. We also found no significant difference in 
rates of nonfatal outcomes, such as all-cause readmis-
sion, ACS, stroke or TIA, and bleeding. These results 
lend support to healthcare policies that advocated sub-
stitution of Plavix with generic clopidogrel to reduce 
healthcare costs.
In Ontario, the policy of switching from Plavix to 
generic clopidogrel after patent expiration led to a sub-
stantial cost saving. In 2010, we estimated that >24 
million Plavix tablets were dispensed to older patients 
in the outpatient setting, costing an estimated Can$53 
million on medications alone (Plavix cost=Can$2.58 per

pill in 2010). In 2012, the number of Plavix or generic 
clopidogrel tables dispensed had increased to >28 mil-
lion and would have cost the ODB >Can$72.8 million 
if Plavix was not substituted. Instead, the actual cost 
for these medications was only ≈Can$19 million (a sav-
ing of >Can$32 million; 1 US$=1.35 Can$ on May 30, 
2017). Because the Ontario drug formulary only reim-
burses medications for older patients, savings across 
the entire ACS population in Ontario would be even 
greater. Given the lack of clinical difference between 
Plavix and generic clopidogrel, health systems that con-
tinue to fund Plavix should considered substituting to 
the generic formulation to reduce healthcare resources.
Mirroring the noninferiority design of randomized tri-
als,18,22,23 our study is among the first to combine pro-
pensity-weighted analysis and a prespecified noninferior-
ity margin to compare the clinical outcomes of generic 
and brand name medications. We think this design is 
appropriate given that these medications are biochemi-
cally similar and consistent with the clinical question of 
whether they could provide efficacy without increasing 
risk of adverse events. Although bioequivalence studies 
require no more than a 20% difference in the area under 
the concentration–time curve (measure of absorption) 
and maximum concentration between the brand and 
generic product,5,7,8 we chose a more stringent nonin-
feriority margin that generic clopidogrel would not have 
>10% increase in relative HRs in adverse clinical events as 
compared with Plavix based on the clinical judgment of 
our group. Noninferiority margins of future studies com-
paring generic and brand name medications should be 
individualized based on the disease, outcomes of interest, 
and incremental cost saving of the generic alternatives.
Our study allays concerns from smaller studies that 
substituting clopidogrel from Plavix will not lead to

increased risk of death or readmission for ACS. Kovacic 
et al11 evaluated 1064 high-risk patients who received 
PCIs and found that rate of stent thrombosis increased 
from 0.14% to 0.38% after clopidogrel was substi-
tuted for Plavix. However, this study was conducted 
at a single center in the United States, and the find-
ings could be because of random fluctuation of event 
rates.11 An Italian study evaluated 1579 patients with 
ACS and found a significantly higher proportion of 
patients treated with clopidogrel base had high plate-
let relativity when compared with Plavix (42.4% versus 
25.4%).9 However, it is important to note that clopi-
dogrel base is a generic preparation that differs from 
Plavix, which is formulated using clopidogrel bisulfate. 
In contrast, both generic clopidogrel and Plavix in our 
study are manufactured as the same salt as is the case 
in both Canada and the United States. The lack of out-
comes difference between Plavix and clopidogrel was 
also consistent in subgroups of patients by age, sex, 
diabetes mellitus, prior stroke, or admission presenta-
tion. For the subgroup of PCI during hospitalization, we 
observed slightly higher HR associated with clopidogrel 
than Plavix, but the interaction did not research statisti-
cal significance. We also observed that patients who 
did not receive PCI during hospitalization were at signif-
icantly higher risk of adverse outcomes, likely because 
of selection biases of forgoing invasive cardiac catheter-
ization among the highest risk patients. Our ability to 
detect a difference in adverse outcomes, such as stroke 
or bleeding, was low because they were infrequently 
observed at a rate of ≈2% in the year after hospital 
discharge. We also did not assess for stent thrombosis 
because of the inability to capture this outcome with 
our data. We think a system to ensure safety of newly 
approved medication when applied in clinical practice is 
important. However, a successful system of medication 
surveillance will likely require a systematic approach that 
involves coordination of many large health systems.
Several limitations of our study merit consideration. 
First, observational studies are potentially subject to the 
influence of selection biases. However, we think the 
potential for selection bias is minimized in our study 
because both groups received similar treatment and 
generic medication substitution occurred without knowl-
edge of the treating physicians. Second, our study may 
be subjected to temporal changes because ACS patient 
characteristics and management can change over time. 
However, our propensity-weighted cohort was well bal-
anced for patient, physician, and hospital characteris-
tics, reducing the likelihood of confounding. We have 
also previously shown that mortality rates in ACS cohort 
did not change during this time period.12 Third, because 
of the number of generic formulations on the market, 
we combined all generic clopidogrel medications into a 
single group to perform our main analysis. We think this 
was a reasonable approach because all generic clopido-
grel formulations have been shown to have similar bio-
equivalency with Plavix and had been approved as Plavix 
replacements. We performed additional analyses and 
found no significant difference in clinical outcomes of 
patients prescribed different clopidogrel formulations. 
Yet, the ability to detect significant variations between 
the many clopidogrel preparations is limited because 
Apo-clopidogrel was the most commonly used prepa-
ration in Ontario, and large confidence intervals in the 
HRs were observed for the other less commonly used 
clopidogrel preparations. Finally, our study was limited 
to an older cohort of patients ≥65 years. However, this 
subgroup represents the most vulnerable population 
with the highest rates of adverse events.
In conclusion, our large, population-based study 
found that there is no difference in major adverse car-
diovascular outcomes at 1 year in patients with ACS 
prescribed generic clopidogrel after hospitalization 
compared with those prescribed Plavix. Our finding 
supports the use of generic clopidogrel in ACS, which 
could lead to substantial healthcare cost saving without 
diminishing clinical effectiveness.
