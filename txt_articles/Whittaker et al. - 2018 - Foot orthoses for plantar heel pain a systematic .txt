Objective To investigate the effectiveness of foot 
orthoses for pain and function in adults with plantar heel 
pain.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. The 
primary outcome was pain or function categorised by 
duration of follow-up as short (0 to 6 weeks), medium (7 
to 12 weeks) or longer term (13 to 52 weeks).
Data sources Medline, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Embase 
and the Cochrane Library from inception to June 2017.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies 
must have used a randomised parallel-group design and 
evaluated foot orthoses for plantar heel pain. At least 
one outcome measure for pain or function must have 
been reported.
Results A total of 19 trials (1660 participants) were 
included. In the short term, there was very low-quality 
evidence that foot orthoses do not reduce pain or improve 
function. In the medium term, there was moderate-
quality evidence that foot orthoses were more effective 
than sham foot orthoses at reducing pain (standardised 
mean difference −0.27 (−0.48 to −0.06)). There was no 
improvement in function in the medium term. In the longer 
term, there was very low-quality evidence that foot orthoses 
do not reduce pain or improve function. A comparison of 
customised and prefabricated foot orthoses showed no 
difference at any time point.
Conclusion There is moderate-quality evidence that 
foot orthoses are effective at reducing pain in the 
medium term, however it is uncertain whether this is a 
clinically important change.
InTRODuCTIOn
Plantar heel pain (PHP) is one of the most common 
conditions affecting the foot. Prevalence estimates 
range from 4% to 7% in the general and older popu-
lations, respectively.1 2 In athletic populations, preva-
lence estimates are higher, ranging from 8% to 22%,3 4 
and it is one of the most common overuse conditions 
of the foot and ankle.5 There are many purported risk 
factors for PHP
. In the non-athletic population, the 
most common associated factor (found in cross-sec-
tional studies) is increased body mass index.6 7 Only 
one prospective risk factor study has been conducted 
for PHP in an athletic population, which investigated 
a cohort of runners.8 This study found a varus hind-
foot, a varus knee position, a cavus foot type, spiked 
footwear and middle-distance running as the most 
important risk factors.
PHP is usually treated conservatively, and there 
are many recommended interventions, including 
foot orthoses.9–11 The rationale for the use of foot 
orthoses for people with PHP is unclear due to scant 
research that is specific to this condition. There is 
some evidence that foot orthoses reduce peak plantar 
pressures at the heel in those with PHP12 13 and 
may decrease plantar fascia strain.14 Studies that are 
not specific for PHP have found that foot orthoses 
modify tissue loading by altering kinematics, kinetics, 
muscle activity and sensory feedback.15–18 However, 
of greater importance is whether foot orthoses are of 
benefit to patients, that is, whether they are effective 
at reducing symptoms.
Several 
systematic 
reviews 
have 
previously 
investigated the effectiveness of foot orthoses for 
PHP
.9 10 19–23 T
wo of these conducted meta-anal-
yses,22 23 however they reported inconsistent findings 
and their database searches are now at least eight 
years 
old. One meta-analysis22 concluded that there was 
insufficient evidence that customised foot orthoses 
reduce pain compared with sham or non-customised 
foot orthoses in the medium term (at 12 weeks). In 
contrast, the other meta-analysis23 concluded that 
foot orthoses decrease pain and improve function 
in the short, medium and longer term (<6 weeks, 
6 to 12 weeks, and >12 weeks, respectively). These 
inconsistencies can be attributed to differences in the 
inclusion criteria (eg, including non-randomised trials 
and only investigating customised foot orthoses) and 
in the comparator interventions that were evaluated 
(one review excluded the comparator groups from 
their meta-analyses).
Given PHP is a common condition in both 
athletic 
and 
non-athletic 
populations, 
it 
is 
important to understand what interventions are 
the most effective at reducing pain and improving 
function. Previous meta-analyses have found incon-
sistent findings, and additional clinical trials have 
been completed since the last meta-analyses were 
published. Therefore, there is a need to conduct a 
rigorous review of the effectiveness of foot orthoses 
for PHP
, so up-to-date evidence is available for 
clinicians when managing PHP
. Accordingly, our 
aim was to systematically review and conduct 
meta-analyses of randomised trials that have evalu-
ated foot orthoses for PHP
. We also endeavoured to 
improve on previous meta-analyses by (1) including 
all types of foot orthoses from randomised trials, 
using the highest level of evidence possible and (2) 
evaluating the quality of the evidence by using the 
Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Develop-
ment and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Review
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies
Included studies were randomised trials (quasi-randomised trials 
were excluded) published in peer-reviewed journals. Studies 
were included if they compared foot orthoses with any compar-
ator (eg, foot orthoses vs night splints). For the intervention to 
be regarded as a foot orthosis, it had to (1) be an in-shoe device, 
(2) aim to contour the plantar arch (not a flat insole) and (3) 
extend further distally than the anterior margin of the heel (not 
a heel pad). Studies must have investigated the effect of foot 
orthoses on PHP and included at least one outcome measure for 
either pain or function.
search strategy
Medline, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Embase and the Cochrane 
Library were searched on 14 July 2016, and the search was 
updated on 26 June 2017 (online supplementary appendix 1). 
Complementary searches were conducted on trial registries 
(eg, http:// 
clinicaltrials. 
gov/). Citation tracking was performed 
for identified studies (eg, Google Scholar) and reference lists 
scanned for studies that were missed in the original systematic 
search.
Data collection
Search results were exported into Endnote X7.2.1 (Thomson 
Reuters, New York, USA) and duplicates removed. T
wo authors 
(GAW and CLR) independently examined the title and abstract 
of studies, and irrelevant studies were excluded. Disagreements 
between the authors were resolved by including a third author 
(KBL). Full-text articles were obtained for the remaining studies, 
and these were examined for eligibility based on the inclusion 
criteria.
A data extraction form was used to extract study character-
istics (eg, group characteristics at baseline) and outcome data. 
The primary outcomes extracted were pain, function and first-
step pain, but other variables including study characteristics, 
variables affecting bias (eg, blinding and differences in partici-
pant characteristics between groups at baseline), adverse effects 
and the characteristics of the foot orthoses were also extracted. 
One author (GAW) extracted the data and a random sample of 
25% of the trials were analysed by a second reviewer (CLR) to 
minimise errors. The mean and SD on any standardised scale 
for pain or function at time points categorised as short term (0 
to 6 weeks), medium term (7 to 12 weeks) and longer term (13 
to 52 weeks) were extracted from each included trial. These 
categories were chosen based on when most trials reported 
outcome measures,25–27 and allowed outcome measures obtained 
at similar time points to be compared in a meta-analysis, thus 
reducing heterogeneity. An attempt was made to obtain missing 
data of trials that reported incomplete outcomes by contacting 
the authors. If no response was provided, missing values were 
determined, if possible, by calculating SDs based on p values.28 
Any remaining trials for which means and SDs were not available 
were excluded from the meta-analysis.
Data analysis
All data were synthesised and analysed using RevMan (V
.5.3; 
Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane 
Collaboration, 2014). Determining which comparison the 
studies were allocated to was based on definitions of foot 
orthoses outlined in online supplementary appendix 2.
The relative treatment effect of each study was estimated by 
calculating the mean difference (MD) or the standardised mean 
difference (SMD) if trials used different outcome measures. 
Outcome measures where higher scores indicated less pain or 
improved function were multiplied by −1 to ensure common 
directionality of results. The SMD was interpreted as having a 
small effect if approximately 0.2, a moderate effect if 0.5, a large 
effect if 0.8 and a very large effect if 1.3.29 An inverse-variance 
random-effects model was applied to all meta-analyses given 
the design variability of the included trials.30 Heterogeneity was 
investigated using the χ2 and I2 statistics.
To allow for clinically meaningful interpretation of findings, 
significant effects from meta-analyses were back-transformed to 
a common scale using a SD from a representative study28 and 
compared with minimal important difference values previously 
calculated for foot orthoses and PHP
.31
In addition, an overall comparison of foot orthoses (regard-
less of the type used) with sham orthoses in the short, medium 
and longer term was made for any study that compared a ‘real’ 
orthosis (any orthosis that is intended to provide a therapeutic 
effect) with a sham orthosis (specifically, a control orthosis). If 
more than one foot orthosis was used in a trial (eg, a three-group 
trial that included customised, prefabricated and sham orthoses), 
the foot orthosis groups were combined using the method 
described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of 
Interventions28 before comparing with the sham group.
Assessment of study quality
Risk of bias assessment was conducted by two authors (GAW 
and JMT) using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing 
risk of bias.28 If at least one of the criteria was rated as high, the 
trial was considered to have a high risk of bias. To be considered 
as low risk of bias, all criteria had to be rated low risk. Any trials 
not meeting these criteria were rated unclear. Cohen’s kappa 
was calculated to measure the agreement between reviewers.32 A 
sensitivity analysis was also conducted in which trials identified 
as high risk of bias were excluded to assess the impact of this on 
the meta-analysis.
Outcome level assessment of the comparisons between trials 
were undertaken using the GRADE approach.33 The overall 
quality of the evidence was investigated for limitations (risk of 
bias), inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias 
and magnitude of effect. Outcomes were rated down one level 
for limitations if greater than 25% of the participants included 
in the outcome came from studies considered to have a high 
risk of bias. Studies were rated down one level for inconsistency 
if there was significant heterogeneity (I2 greater than 40%).28 
Outcomes were rated down one level for indirectness if there 
were significant differences between the populations, interven-
tions or outcomes measured across studies.34 Outcomes were 
rated down one level for imprecision if the confidence intervals 
represented different conclusions and/or the total participants 
included in the outcome was less than 100. This sample size 
was based on a minimal important difference of 12.5-points 
on a 100-point scale,31 and SD of 21 derived from previous 
research.26 35 This provides 80% power to detect a moderate 
SMD of 0.5.29 Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots 
for analyses with greater than 10 studies or if there was obvious 
industry involvement.28 The outcomes for each comparison 
were classified into four categories: (1) high (we are very confi-
dent that the true effect lies close to the estimate of effect), (2) 
moderate (we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: 
the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect 
but there is a possibility that it is substantially different), (3) low 
(our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect 
may be substantially different from the estimate of effect) and (4)

very low (we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: 
the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the esti-
mate of effect).36
REsulTs
The systematic search identified 900 articles, and after screening, 
19 articles documenting the findings of 19 individual trials were 
included in the final review.25–27 37–52 The flow of studies through 
the review is outlined in figure 1.
The combined sample size from the included trials was 1660. 
Of these, 67% were women, the mean age was 47 years and 
the mean body mass index was 30 
kg/m2. Each trial’s interven-
tion, comparator and participant characteristics are summarised 
in online supplementary appendix 3. The review included 29 
types of foot orthosis, with none of the included trials using the 
same type of foot orthosis as those used in another trial (online 
supplementary appendix 4).
Risk of bias assessment (figure 2) concluded that none of the 
included trials were low risk, 17 (89%) were high risk and 2 
(11%) were of unclear risk. A major contributor to assessments 
of high risk of bias was lack of blinding, which occurred in 12 
trials (63%), and selective outcome reporting, which occurred 
in 8 trials (42%) due to inadequate reporting of results that 
prevented their inclusion in a meta-analysis. There was a 
moderate level of agreement between the reviewers (GAW and 
JMT) that assessed risk of bias (κ=0.64).
GRADE evidence profiles are presented in tables 1 and 2. 
Ratings were made at short, medium and longer term time points 
for the comparisons of (1) real foot orthoses with sham foot 
orthoses and (2) customised foot orthoses with prefabricated 
foot orthoses. The decision to focus on these comparisons was

Pain
Comparisons for which a meta-analysis was not possible due 
to only a single trial being available are displayed in online 
supplementary appendix 5. Data were not available for three 
trials39 40 48 after contacting the authors, and these trials were 
excluded from the meta-analysis.
Data reported in the short term were available from 10 trials. 
There were 12 comparisons available and a meta-analysis was 
conducted for 3 comparisons (online supplementary appendix 
6). This meta-analysis found no effect for the following three 
comparisons: customised foot orthoses with sham foot orthoses 
(SMD 0.29 (−0.26 to 0.83)),25 27 firm prefabricated foot 
orthoses with sham foot orthoses (SMD −0.29 (−1.81 to 
1.24))27 50 and firm prefabricated foot orthoses with soft prefab-
ricated foot orthoses (SMD 0.14 (−0.42 to 0.69)).46 50 No effect 
was also found from three trials25 27 50 that compared all real foot 
orthoses (all customised and/or prefabricated foot orthoses) with 
sham foot orthoses (SMD −0.13 (−0.94 to 0.68)) and from two 
trials27 38 that compared customised foot orthoses with soft or 
firm prefabricated foot orthoses (SMD −0.04 (−0.33 to 0.24)) 
(figure 3).
Data reported in the medium term were available from 12 
trials. There were 15 comparisons available and a meta-anal-
ysis was conducted for 5 comparisons (online supplementary

Review
sham foot orthoses in three trials25–27 showed that custom-
ised foot orthoses were more effective (SMD −0.28 (−0.55 
to −0.01)). This finding was back-transformed using a SD of 
2126 to the pain subscale (0–100-point scale) of the relevant 
outcome measure, the Foot Health Status Questionnaire. This 
equates to a change of 5.9 points in favour of customised foot 
orthoses, which does not meet the previously calculated minimal 
important difference for pain of 12.5 points.31 This meta-anal-
ysis found no effect from three trials26 27 44 that compared 
customised foot orthoses with firm prefabricated foot orthoses 
(SMD −0.06 (−0.30 to 0.18)). In addition, no effect was found 
for the following comparisons: customised foot orthoses with 
heel pads (SMD −0.26 (−1.09 to 0.57)),42 45 customised foot 
orthoses with night splints (SMD −0.27 (−0.59 to 0.04))44 47 
and firm prefabricated foot orthoses with sham foot orthoses 
(SMD −0.25 (−0.59 to 0.09)).26 27
The comparison of all real foot orthoses with sham foot 
orthoses in three trials25–27 showed a small effect in favour of 
real foot orthoses (SMD −0.27 (−0.51 to −0.02)) (figure 3). 
After back-transforming this finding using the method described 
above, the change in favour of real foot orthoses was 5.7 points, 
which does not meet the minimal important difference of 12.5 
points. This meta-analysis found no effect from four trials26 27 38 44 
for the comparison of customised foot orthoses with firm or soft 
prefabricated foot orthoses (SMD −0.09 (−0.27 to 0.09)).
Data reported in the longer term were available from three 
trials. There were four comparisons available and a meta-anal-
ysis was conducted for one comparison (online supplemen-
tary appendix 6). This meta-analysis found no effect from two 
trials25 26 that compared customised foot orthoses with sham foot 
orthoses (SMD −0.24 (−0.82 to 0.33)). There was also no effect 
from two trials25 26 that compared all real foot orthoses with 
sham foot orthoses (SMD −0.23 (−0.82 to 0.37)) (figure 3).
‘First step’ pain
Comparisons for which a meta-analysis was not possible (due 
to there only being a single trial) are displayed in online supple-
mentary appendix 5. Data were unable to be obtained from one 
trial40 after contacting the authors and were excluded from the 
meta-analysis. Data for ‘first step’ pain in the short term were 
available from a single trial,27 and no trials reported ‘first step’ 
pain in the longer term.
Data reported for ‘first step’ pain in the medium term were 
available from two trials. Overall, five comparisons were avail-
able, with sufficient trials for a meta-analysis to be conducted 
for one comparison (online supplementary appendix 6). This 
meta-analysis found no effect from two trials27 44 that compared 
customised foot orthoses with firm prefabricated foot orthoses 
(SMD −0.01 (−0.30 to 0.28)).
Function
Comparisons for which a meta-analysis was not possible due to 
only a single trial being available are displayed in online supple-
mentary appendix 7. Data were unable to be obtained from four 
trials37–39 41 after attempting to contact the authors and were 
excluded from the meta-analysis. Data for function in the short 
term were reported in five trials; however, there were insuffi-
cient data to conduct a meta-analysis.
Data reported in the medium term were available from six trials. 
There were seven comparisons available, with sufficient trials for 
a meta-analysis from three comparisons (online supplementary 
appendix 6). This meta-analysis found no effect for three trials25–27 
that compared customised foot orthoses with sham foot orthoses 
(SMD −0.21 (−0.48 to 0.05)), two trials26 27 that compared 
customised foot orthoses with firm prefabricated foot orthoses 
(SMD −0.07 (−0.40 to 0.26)) and two trials26 27 that compared 
firm prefabricated foot orthoses with sham foot orthoses (SMD 
−0.06 (−0.39 to 0.27)). There was also no effect found from 
three trials25–27 that compared all real foot orthoses with sham foot 
orthoses (SMD −0.17 (−0.41 to 0.07)) and two trials26 27 that 
compared customised foot orthoses with firm or soft prefabricated 
foot orthoses (SMD −0.07 (−0.40 to 0.26)) (figure 4).
Data reported in the longer term were available from three 
trials. There were five comparisons available and a meta-anal-
ysis was conducted for one comparison (online supplemen-
tary appendix 6). This meta-analysis found no effect from two 
trials25 26 that compared customised foot orthoses with sham 
foot orthoses (MD −4.69 (−10.57 to 1.19)). Similarly, no effect 
was found for the comparison of all real foot orthoses with sham 
foot orthoses (SMD −0.21 (−0.49 to 0.07))25 26 (figure 4).
sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was conducted that excluded trials rated as 
having a high risk of bias. When these trials were excluded, there 
was no change to the significant findings. In the medium term, 
customised foot orthoses were found to be more effective than 
sham foot orthoses at reducing pain from two trials25 26 (SMD 
−0.32 (−0.63 to −0.02)), and all real foot orthoses were found 
to be more effective than sham foot orthoses from the same two 
trials (SMD −0.32 (−0.61 to −0.04)). After back-transforming 
these findings using the method described previously, the change 
did not meet the minimal important difference of 12.5 points 
(6.7 points for both analyses).31

Review
DIsCussIOn
This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials 
found moderate quality evidence that foot orthoses are effec-
tive at reducing pain in the medium term (7 to 12 weeks) when 
compared with sham foot orthoses. Moderate-quality evidence, 
as defined by GRADE, indicates that the true effect is close to 
this result but may vary. Furthermore, the effect size is small, 
so it is uncertain if this reduction in pain is clinically important 
for patients. In contrast, there is no evidence that foot orthoses 
improve function in the medium term. In the short term, the data 
relating to the effect of foot orthoses on pain was inconsistent, 
and there were insufficient data available for function. Conse-
quently, the quality of this evidence is very low, which indicates 
that the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the 
estimate of the effect. In the longer term, this study found very-
low-quality evidence to low-quality evidence that foot orthoses 
are not effective at reducing pain or improving function. Only 
two trials had data that could be pooled for meta-analysis, and 
they had different endpoints, with one ending at 6 months25 and 
the other at 12 months.26
This review also investigated two other key issues. The first 
issue relates to whether a particular type of material—soft or 
firm—provides greater benefit, as a variety of materials are used 
to manufacture foot orthoses. A meta-analysis was only possible 
for the short term from two trials,46 50 which found no difference 
between soft and firm materials for pain. In the medium and 
longer term, there were insufficient data available to estimate if 
there is a benefit of one type of material compared with another. 
Therefore, further high-quality randomised trials comparing soft 
and firm materials are required.
The second issue relates to which type of orthosis (such as 
customised or prefabricated) provides greater benefit. Custom-
ised and prefabricated foot orthoses were found to have a similar 
effectiveness in relation to pain and were similar in their effect 
on function in the medium term. However, the GRADE rating of 
this evidence is very low to low, and consequently the true effect 
may be different.
Comparison with previous studies
T
wo meta-analyses have previously attempted to quantify the 
effectiveness of foot orthoses for PHP
. The first meta-analysis by 
Hawke and colleagues22 reviewed the effectiveness of custom-
ised foot orthoses on all types of foot pain and included five 
randomised or controlled clinical trials that investigated PHP
. 
The authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence that 
customised foot orthoses reduce pain compared with sham or 
non-customised foot orthoses at 12 weeks, or reduce pain at 6 to 
8 weeks when used with a stretching programme or night splints. 
The finding that foot orthoses are not effective between 7 and 12 
weeks is different to the results obtained in this review. However, 
the systematic search was conducted in 2007, and a number of 
trials (eight trials included in this review) have recently been 
published that provide more data to include in a meta-analysis.
The second meta-analysis by Lee and coworkers23 investi-
gated the effect of foot orthoses in reducing pain and improving 
function, and included randomised trials and prospective cohort 
studies. The authors concluded that foot orthoses decrease pain 
and improve function in the short, medium and longer term (<6 
weeks, 6 to 12 weeks and >12 weeks, respectively). The finding 
that foot orthoses are effective at all three time points is incon-
sistent with the finding of the review by Hawke and colleagues,22 
and differs to the results obtained in this review. However, Lee 
and coworkers23 pooled each study’s orthosis group data for 
the respective time point and then compared the percentage 
improvement between the three time points. Therefore, the 
comparator group from each study was excluded, and no direct 
between-group comparisons were made. As a result, the effect 
sizes obtained may be exaggerated given there are no compar-
ator (ie, control) group data that were included in a meta-anal-
ysis. Further exaggeration of effect sizes may have occurred due 
to the authors including prospective cohort studies.
strengths and limitations
Strengths of this review include the use of a rigorous search 
strategy, inclusion of only randomised trials, and appraisal of the 
quality of the data using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for 
assessing risk of bias and GRADE. However, there are several 
limitations that also need to be considered when interpreting the 
findings. There was a lack of data relating to short-term or longer-
term findings (time points before 6 weeks and after 12 weeks). 
Only three trials27 46 50 reported data that could be included in a 
meta-analysis in the short term, and only two trials25 26 reported 
data in the longer term. In addition, incomplete reporting in the 
included trials resulted in downgraded evidence quality and also 
reduced the potential data available for meta-analyses. GRADE 
has highlighted that the evidence for the effectiveness of foot 
orthoses for PHP ranges between very low and moderate quality 
for the most important outcomes reported in this review.
Regarding the back-transformation of SMDs, the method used 
in this review is based on a number of assumptions that readers 
should consider when interpreting these results. To have confi-
dence that a back-transformed figure is accurate, it would be 
necessary to determine whether the outcome measures included 
in specific meta-analyses were similar, and that the SD used to 
perform the calculation was representative of the population.54 
For the back-transformation in this review, there were limited

Review
data available on the comparability of the two questionnaires 
used in the meta-analyses, a Visual Analogue Scale and the Foot 
Health Status Questionnaire. However, the construct validity 
of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire has been found to be 
comparable with a Visual Analogue Scale.55 Regarding the SD 
selected for this calculation, a representative trial26 was selected 
rather than using the pooled SD. However, the selection of the 
SD is arbitrary given the small SMDs, so the conclusion that the 
back-transformed SMD does not meet the previously calculated 
minimal important difference value would be the same regard-
less of the SD selected (within appropriate boundaries for SDs 
that are representative of those reported for similar trials). 
Bearing these assumptions in mind, the back-transformed SMD 
has been included in this review to provide a comparison of 
the findings with the previously calculated minimal important 
difference values, to offer a clinically relevant interpretation of 
the findings.
Finally, there was considerable intervention variability, as none 
of the included trials evaluated the same foot orthosis. Because 
of this, a wide variety of materials, arch contours, methods of 
casting and prescription have been evaluated. This may result in 
heterogeneity when comparing studies, leading to reduced effect 
sizes and limited evidence regarding which design characteristics 
of a foot orthosis are most effective.
Clinical implications
Based on the findings of this review, foot orthoses may be recom-
mended as effective for PHP in the medium term, but the reduc-
tion in pain may not be sufficient for some people given the 
small effect size. The findings also highlight that the maximum 
effectiveness of foot orthoses may not be reached until 7 to 12 
weeks after the commencement of treatment. This is important 
for health practitioners to consider when planning treatment and 
may suggest the need for a multi-modal approach that incorpo-
rates treatments that are effective in the shorter term (less than 
7 weeks).
This review found no difference between customised and 
prefabricated foot orthoses for pain or function from very-low-
quality evidence to low-quality evidence. As such, health practi-
tioners may consider using prefabricated foot orthoses that are 
appropriately contoured to the foot rather than customised foot 
orthoses, as they may be less expensive.56 No other clear recom-
mendations can be made regarding what characteristics of foot 
orthoses are beneficial (such as soft or firm materials), or whether 
foot orthoses are more or less effective than other interventions. 
Furthermore, very few trials investigated ‘first step’ pain, so it is 
unclear what effect foot orthoses have on this outcome. Given 
‘first step’ pain is a hallmark feature of PHP
,11 future evaluations 
should incorporate this outcome measure.
None of the included trials specifically evaluated the effective-
ness of foot orthoses in a sample of athletic individuals, therefore 
it is unclear whether the findings of this review will be similar 
in specific athletic populations. Future trials should investigate 
the effectiveness of foot orthoses in a purely athletic sample (eg, 
long-distance runners) to guide better management of athletes 
with PHP
. Nevertheless, based on the available evidence, the 
management of specific athletic populations should not differ 
to the non-athletic population. While the specific risk factors 
may differ between athletic and non-athletic populations, 
modifying tissue stresses to the structures in the plantar heel 
is regarded as being a key principle of managing plantar heel 
pain. Foot orthoses modify tissue loading through a number of 
different mechanisms,15–18 so they are an important component 
of treatment for PHP
, whether in athletes or non-athletes. When 
considering whether to implement foot orthoses in athletes, 
health practitioners may need to consider other factors such 
as whether orthoses can be accommodated in footwear or how 
they might influence performance, although studies investigating 
the impact of foot orthoses on performance (such as running 
economy) are sparse and equivocal.57–59
COnClusIOn
This review found moderate-quality evidence that foot orthoses 
are more effective at reducing pain than sham foot orthoses in 
the medium term (from 7 to 12 weeks). However, the effect size 
is small, so it is uncertain whether this reduction in pain is clin-
ically important for patients. No evidence was found that foot 
orthoses are effective in the short or longer term at reducing pain 
(including ‘first step’ pain) or improving function. In addition, 
this review found no difference between customised and prefab-
ricated foot orthoses, or between soft and firm foot orthotic 
materials, for reducing pain or improving function. Aside from 
the findings in the medium term, the evidence that these conclu-
sions are drawn from is of very low to low quality, so there is the 
possibility that future trials of a higher quality may change some 
of the findings of this review.
What are the new findings?
 
► Previous studies have found inconsistent results regarding 
the effectiveness of foot orthoses for plantar heel pain.
 
► This review found moderate-quality evidence that foot 
orthoses are more effective than sham foot orthoses to 
reduce pain, however it is uncertain whether this is a 
clinically meaningful change.
 
► Health practitioners may consider using foot orthoses for 
plantar heel pain, but the reduction in pain may not be 
sufficient for some people. When choosing a type of orthotic 
device, this review found no difference between customised 
and prefabricated foot orthoses for pain or function.
