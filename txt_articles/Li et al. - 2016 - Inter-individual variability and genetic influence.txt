Abstract
Little is known about the inter-individual variation of cytokine responses to different pathogens in 
healthy individuals. To systematically describe cytokine responses elicited by distinct pathogens, 
and to determine the impact of genetic variation on cytokine production, we profiled cytokines 
produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 197 individuals of European origin from the 
200 Functional Genomics (200FG) cohort within the Human Functional Genomics Study 
(www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org), obtained over three different years. By comparing bacteria- 
and fungi-induced cytokine profiles, we show that most cytokine responses are organized around a 
physiological response to specific pathogens, rather than around a particular immune pathway or 
cytokine. We then correlated genome-wide SNP genotypes with cytokine abundance and identified 
six cytokine QTLs. Among them, a cytokine QTL at NAA35-GOLM1 locus markedly modulates 
IL-6 production in response to multiple pathogens, and associated with susceptibility to 
candidemia. Furthermore, the cytokine QTLs we identified are enriched among SNPs previously 
associated with infectious diseases and heart diseases. These data reveal and begin to explain the 
variability in cytokine production by human immune cells in response to pathogens.
Infections have shaped the human immune system1,2, with genetic variability contributing to 
differential susceptibility to infections3,4. However, a specific genetic variant that may

 confer protection against one infection could prove deleterious for other infections, and this 
is determined by the local infection burden in different geographical locations2. Moreover, 
the shaping of the immune system by infections also has direct consequences for the 
susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases5–7. Unravelling the interplay 
between environmental factors, such as infections, and the genetic variation in a population 
is crucial for understanding the pathogenesis of common autoimmune and infectious 
diseases, and for designing novel therapeutic strategies.
The study of healthy population-based cohorts in the context of appropriate microbial 
stimulations can be used to assess inter-individual variability and to identify genetic loci that 
regulate immune responses8–12. However, practically all the genome-wide studies done to 
date have emphasized the regulatory effect of genetic variation on gene expression by 
focusing on transcript abundance8–12. Since protein quantities are more precise regulators of 
cellular phenotypes13, characterizing the genetic loci that regulate protein abundances and 
biological processes is a crucial next step towards mechanistic insights14.
Here we stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), rather than isolated 
immune cell populations, to capture interactions between different immune cell types (e.g. 
between monocytes and T cells) that are very important for the natural immune responses. 
We studied inter-individual and inter-stimulus variation in production of cytokines, and we 
identified independent genome-wide significant cytokine quantitative trait loci (cQTLs). The 
regulatory consequences of these cQTLs on downstream genes were characterized by 
performing the expression-QTL (eQTL) using stimulation-specific expression data15. By 
comparing the bacterial and fungal induced cytokine profiles and cQTLs, we show that the 
genetic variability in the immune genes/pathways is organized around a physiological 
response to specific pathogens, rather than a response aiming to modulate production of a 
specific cytokine. In addition, we have identified and validated a cytokine QTL that reveals a 
novel trans-regulatory network in the context of cytokine responses to important human 
pathogens.
Results
Stimulation increases inter-individual variability in cytokine levels
To systematically determine the impact of genetic variation on cytokine production, we 
obtained PBMCs from 197 individuals of European origin from the 200 Functional 
Genomics (200FG) cohort within the Human Functional Genomics Study 
(www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org) in three different years (Supplementary Table 1), and 
profiled cytokines secreted in response to a variety of bacterial and fungal pathogens 
(Supplementary Table 2). In the first study we measured seven cytokines induced by ten 
different stimuli in 73 healthy volunteers (year 2009 cohort). After stringent quality control 
of cytokine distributions (see Methods), we obtained a total of 62 (cytokine-stimuli pairs) 
different cytokine measurements (Supplementary Table 3). Cytokine production follows a 
non-Gaussian or bimodal distribution, with a few exceptions (Figs. 1a–d). Individuals 
exhibit significantly increased inter-individual variability (P < 0.01) in cytokine secretion 
upon stimulation, compared to basal unstimulated state (Figs. 1e–f and Supplementary Fig.

 1). We obtained similar results from the other two datasets measured in 2011 and 2013 
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Cytokine responses are organized in a pathogen-specific manner
It is possible that an individual could be either a high or low responder when considering all 
cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10) produced in response to one microorganism. 
Alternatively an individual could be a high or low responder for a particular cytokine in 
response to stimulation with any type of pathogen. To examine this, we performed a 
unsupervised clustering of the cytokine responses induced by the various pathogens and 
microbial ligands. Correlations between levels of various cytokines were found in response 
to stimulation with a certain pathogen, rather than within a cytokine pathway, and this 
conclusion was validated by additional analyses in the cohort studies performed in 2011 and 
2013 (Fig. 2a) (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). For example, bacterial (LPS, E. coli and M. 
tuberculosis) induced cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10) were strongly clustered together 
and were clearly separated from fungus (C. albicans) induced cytokine cluster (Fig. 2a).
IFN-γ and IL-17 production were exceptions to this rule, however; the magnitude of IFN-γ 
or IL-17 production by PBMCs from any individual correlated independently of the identity 
of the pathogen stimulus (Fig. 2a). This suggests an important evolutionary role for TH17 
responses, which may be a general host defence pathway for both bacteria and fungi. 
Secondly, the differentiation of naïve T cells into TH1 or TH17 effector lymphocytes is under 
the control of monocyte-derived cytokines16. Therefore, a strong or weak monocyte-
dependent cytokine production capacity may be associated with strong or weak helper T cell 
responses. However, upon pair-wise correlation of cytokines we observed two clusters (Fig. 
2b) in which Cluster 1 consists of cytokines mainly produced by monocytes, while Cluster 2 
consists of cytokines known to be released mainly by T-cells. Although concentrations of 
IL-12, IL-18 and IL-23 were very low in our system, and could not be used to assess 
correlations (data not shown), other monocyte-derived cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6, 
which have been reported to induce TH17 responses17, were easily detectable. However, 
there was a poor correlation between monocyte-derived cytokine production and T cell 
cytokine production (Figs. 2b–e). Moreover, TH1 and TH17 responses did not strongly 
correlate with each other, although the correlation was somewhat stronger than between 
monocyte and lymphocyte responses. This was also consistent when we focused specifically 
on one type of stimulation. For example, we observed strong correlation between Candida-
induced IL-6 and IL-8 and between Candida-induced IL-10 and TNF-α, while IL-17 showed 
poor correlation with any of the other cytokines (Supplementary Figs. 5a–c). This 
demonstrates that one particular individual could be a high responder in terms of one set of 
cytokines but a low responder for other cytokines.
Genome-wide cQTL mapping identifies cell-count independent cQTLs
We generated both genotype and cytokine data for 107 individuals (Supplementary Table 1) 
We used the 2013 dataset as a discovery cohort to identify genome-wide significant cQTLs 
since this cohort contained the largest numbers of individuals (n=79). Genotyping was 
performed using Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome SNP chip and was imputed to obtain 
genotypes at ~ 7 million SNPs. We selected ~ 4 million SNPs that showed minor allele

 frequency ≥ 5% and passed other standard quality filters. The cytokine and genotype data 
available enabled us to study cQTLs for three stimuli: a Gram-negative stimulus (LPS), a 
mycobacterium (M. tuberculosis; MTB) and a fungus (C. albicans), which provided 18 
measurements (3 stimulations×6 cytokines; IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL1-Ra, IL-1β, TNF-α). IFN-
γ and IL-17 measurements were not available for the 2013 dataset. Upon quality check for 
cytokine distributions, we obtained 17 stimulation-cytokine pairs (Supplementary Fig. 2) for 
which the data were reliable to correlate with genotypes at ~ 4 million SNPs. Raw cytokine 
levels were first log-transformed then mapped to genotype data using a linear regression 
model with age and gender as covariates. This analysis revealed six significant cQTLs (P < 5 
×10−8) (Supplementary Tables 4–5). We identified two independent cQTLs for C. albicans-
induced IL-6 levels (Figs. 3a–c), two independent cQTLs for MTB-induced IL-8 levels 
(Figs. 3d–f), one for C. albicans-induced TNF-α and one for LPS-induced IL-10 levels 
while no cQTLs were identified for IL-1β and IL-1Ra. The total number cQTLs at different 
thresholds are listed in Supplementary Table 6.
We next tested whether different immune cell counts in PBMC preparations influence the 
cQTLs. For this we made use of the FACS assessment in the 500 Functional Genomics study 
(500FG cohort), in which cell populations are examined in detail (see Methods) and 
measured Candida-induced IL-6 and TNF-α levels. First, we analysed the correlation 
structure between cell counts and cytokine measurements (Supplementary Fig. 6) and 
observed weak correlations (mean correlation coefficients across five cell types = 0.062). For 
example, Candida-induced IL-6 levels in PBMCs showed a weak correlation with monocyte 
counts, but not with other cell types. We tested the association of Candida-induced cQTLs 
with cytokine levels in 500FG cohort upon correcting for age, gender and cell counts. 
Among those three cQTLs tested, SNP rs11141235, associated with Candida-induced IL-6 
levels, showed a clear replication of association (Supplementary Table 4; P = 0.017) even 
after correction for monocyte cell counts (P = 0.030). In contrast, none of the 6 cQTLs were 
directly associated with cell counts (data not shown), suggesting the independent role of 
genetic variation on regulating cytokine production.
Correlations between cytokine responses are partially genetically determined
The clustering of cytokine responses (Fig. 2) showed correlations of cytokines induced by 
specific pathogens, as well as distinct clusters separating the monocyte-derived cytokine 
production from T cell-derived cytokines induced by various stimuli. To assess whether this 
observation may show a genetic component, we tested whether strong cQTLs of one 
pathogen-induced cytokine (P < 1.0×10−5) could also be associated with cytokine levels 
induced by other pathogens albeit with nominal significance (P < 0.05). QTLs of IL-10 were 
more likely to be pathogen-specific (Supplementary Fig. 7a), while QTLs of other cytokines 
(IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α) were more likely to be shared genetic loci that respond to all 
pathogens (Supplementary Figs. 7b–c). We found similar results with different P value 
thresholds (Supplementary Fig. 8). We also found that all six GWAS-significant cQTLs were 
associated with cytokines induced by other bacterial and fungal stimulations (Fig. 4a). SNPs 
affecting fungus-induced IL-6 and IL-8 were also strongly associated with bacteria-induced 
IL-6 and IL-8 levels, but not with IL-10 and TNF-α (Fig. 4a). This indicates that the SNPs 
associated with IL-6 and IL-8 levels are pathogen-independent, maybe because these SNPs

 are acting on genes/proteins that are downstream of pathogen recognition receptors and 
therefore are shared between pathogens. These results suggest that the correlation between 
monocyte-derived cytokines (Fig. 2) may be partly genetically determined. The top 
association for Candida-induced IL-6 at the chr9q21 locus provides an illustrative example 
for a strong shared cQTL (Figs. 4b–c), where the minor allele C at SNP rs11141235 was not 
only associated with lower C. albicans-induced IL-6 production (Fig. 3b), but also with LPS-
induced (Fig. 4b) and MTB induced IL-6 production (Fig. 4c). Importantly, the cQTLs 
identified in the 2013 cohort were all validated in the other cohorts, demonstrating the 
robustness of the associations identified (Supplementary Fig. 9).
A cQTL gene GOLM1 on chr9q21 modulates cytokine production
To identify the putative causal genes at six significant cQTLs, we tested the expression 
levels of all genes located within a 500kb cis-window of the 6 cQTLs in PBMCs stimulated 
with different microbial antigens (Fig. 4d). Genes identified by this differential expression 
analysis were not cytokine genes, suggesting that the cQTLs identified are mainly trans-
QTLs of regulatory genes modulating cytokine production.
The top associated cQTL rs11141235 on the chromosome 9q21 region was associated with 
Candida-induced IL-6 levels (Fig. 3a). To identify the causal mechanism at this locus, we 
generated gene expression data by RNA sequencing in PBMCs from 70 individuals18 with 
and without Candida stimulation. We reconfirmed the significant differential expression of 
GOLM1 in response to Candida stimulation in this larger cohort (Fig. 4e). Next, we mapped 
Candida-response eQTL at rs11141235 and at another SNP rs11141242 in the locus (D
′=0.95), which is a more frequent polymorphism. The eQTL results indicated that 
rs11141242 was significantly (P = 0.016) associated with the expression levels of GOLM1 
(Golgi membrane protein 1), where the minor allele was associated with lower levels of 
GOLM1 (Fig. 5a), while rs11141235 showed a similar trend (Fig. 5b), suggesting the role of 
haplotypes in regulating GOLM1 expression.
GOLM1 cQTL is associated with susceptibility to candidemia
GOLM1 encodes a 73kDa Golgi protein and is upregulated in response to viral infection19. 
We assessed whether genetic variants in GOLM1 locus could influence susceptibility to 
disseminated infection with C. albicans in a previously described cohort of 225 European 
patients with candidemia20. Since the genotype data at rs11141235 was not available from 
this cohort, we tested another variant, rs7036187, that is in linkage disequilibrium with 
rs11141235 (D′ =1) in the GOLM1 locus and found it to be associated with candidemia, 
where the risk allele A was more frequent in cases (P = 0.016, Odds ratio= 2.36). To test 
whether the GOLM1 cQTL affects candidemia through the IL-6 pathway we built a co-
expression network around the GOLM1 using gene expression data from PBMCs of 70 
healthy volunteers either upon Candida stimulation (Fig. 5c) or without stimulation 
(Supplementary Fig. 10). Pathway enrichment analysis on strongly co-expressed genes (r2 < 
0.8) with GOLM1 during Candida stimulation showed GOLM1 co-expressed genes to be 
enriched for cytokine production pathways, which suggests that GOLM1 is associated with 
cytokine signaling (Fig. 5d). The enrichment of genes for cytokine signalling after 
stimulation could be also the consequence of the stimulation and not necessarily specific to

 GOLM1 co-expression. Therefore, we tested whether the extent of gene enrichment for IL-6 
signaling was specifically linked to GOLM1 upon Candida stimulation (see Methods), when 
compared to randomly chosen differentially expressed genes in response to Candida 
stimulation. This analysis showed a significantly stronger enrichment of genes co-expressed 
with GOLM1 for IL-6 signaling than randomly chosen genes (Supplementary Figs. 11a–b). 
In addition, in patients with candidemia, we also assessed the effects of the rs7036187 
polymorphism, a SNP associated to susceptibility to disease, on serum IL-6 concentrations. 
This SNP was associated with circulating IL-6 concentration (Fig. 5e), where AG genotypes 
were associated with lower levels of IL-6 (P = 0.015) suggesting that the polymorphisms in 
the GOLM1 locus may influence Candida-induced cytokines and susceptibility to 
candidemia.
Cytokine QTLs overlap with human disease associated SNPs
We tested whether SNPs previously associated with human diseases and particularly with 
infectious diseases are enriched with cQTLs. We extracted GWAS SNPs from the NHGRI 
GWAS catalog21 and binned them into eight categories based on their association with 
different human phenotypes (See Methods). Next we identified all cQTLs that were 
associated with cytokine levels with a P value < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 6) and tested 
whether these cQTLs are linked to GWAS SNPs or their proxies. Sixty-one percent of 
infectious-disease-associated SNPs were also cQTLs, and 43% of immune-mediated-disease 
associated SNPs were also cQTLs (Fig. 5a). We used height-associated SNPs as background 
SNPs (or null set of SNPs) to test whether cQTLs are more often associated with a particular 
human disease. 38.5% of height associated SNPs were also cQTLs. We observed a 
significant enrichment (P < 9.99 ×10−8) of cQTLs among infectious disease-associated 
SNPs. A proportion of heart disease-associated SNPs were also cQTLs, suggesting a role for 
cytokine pathways in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (Fig. 6a). We found similar 
results when we selected cQTLs with a different P value (P < 0.01, Supplementary Table 6) 
threshold (Supplementary Fig. 12) to test for their enrichment among GWAS SNPs. 
However, the sensitivity of the enrichment results dropped when we used more stringent P 
values to call putative cQTLs since the number of cQTLs available to perform enrichment 
analysis was reduced.
Furthermore, we tested whether infectious and autoimmune disease-associated SNPs are 
predominantly associated with increased or decreased cytokine production. We observed no 
significant difference between the numbers of autoimmune disease risk alleles associated 
with increased or decreased cytokine production (Supplementary Fig. 8). In contrast, risk 
alleles of infectious disease SNPs, with the exception of malaria- associated SNPs, are 
mostly associated with lower cytokine production capacity (Fig. 6b). These patterns suggest 
that the genetic alterations associated with autoimmune diseases are correlated with both 
increased and decreased cytokine production capacity, whereas susceptibility to infections is 
associated with a lower capacity for cytokine production from monocytes or lymphocytes, 
depending on the type of infection. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immune-
mediated disease of the human gastrointestinal tract. We observed a trend where high 
proportion of risk alleles of IBD-associated SNPs were associated with lower cytokine

 production capacity (Fig. 6c), suggesting the role of infectious agents in IBD. These results 
again highlight the importance of response QTLs to understanding complex human diseases.
Discussion
While several recent studies investigated immune traits during steady-state conditions22–24 
or serologic responses to past infections25, an important question remains regarding the 
architecture of the immune response and its relation to genetic variation. While several 
eQTL studies addressed this important question using different immune cell populations 
either without or upon stimulation8,9,11,12, they have two intrinsic limitations: they only used 
stimulation of purified cell populations with purified ligands (with the exception of influenza 
virus stimulation in one of the studies), and eQTLs only interrogate transcript levels which 
are known to correlate only partially with protein abundance13,26–29. The present study 
therefore addresses the importance of understanding human immune responses to pathogens 
by assessing the architecture of one of the most important steps in the activation of the 
immune responses: cytokine production.
First, our study not only confirms the non-parametric nature of cytokine production 
distribution of monocyte-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines30,31, but also extend this to T-
lymphocyte derived cytokines. The non-Gaussian or bi-modal distribution of cytokine 
production identifies low- and high-producers, giving scope to the hypothesis that the 
cytokine synthesis phenotype may have a strong effect on susceptibility to immune-mediated 
diseases.
Second, the production capacity of various cytokines strongly correlates when cells were 
stimulated with a specific pathogen, while the correlation was poor when comparing 
bacterial versus fungal stimulation. This observation makes sense from both an evolutionary 
point of view, as immune responses mainly need to have plasticity to respond to specific 
infectious pressures in a certain geographic area2, and from a biological point of view in 
which Toll-like receptors are the main receptor pathway recognizing bacteria, while C-type 
lectin receptors mainly recognize fungi. Importantly, regulation of the pathogen-specific 
cytokine responses is most likely only partially genetic, as some genetic polymorphisms 
regulate multiple cytokine responses to a certain pathogen (especially for monocyte-derived 
production), while others regulate the monocyte-derived production of cytokine responses 
due to multiple pathogens (see below). It is therefore likely that non-genetic external factors 
encountered during one’s lifetime also play an important role in long-term modulation of 
cytokine responses, and epigenetic regulation may represent one of the molecular substrates 
for this process32,33.
One remarkable exception to the rule of pathogen-centric responses is represented by 
specific lymphocyte responses such as IL-17 production, which represents a separate 
strongly correlated cluster independent of the type of pathogen and may be an important 
aspect of IL-17 biology. Th17 responses are crucial for mucosal host defence34, and defects 
in this pathway lead to high susceptibility to both fungal and bacterial pathogens35–37. These 
data argue that Th17 responses are a crucial component of host defence against both bacteria 
and fungi.

 Third, we have identified six novel genome-wide significant cQTLs that influence cytokine 
responses: IL-6 and IL-8 identify the highest number of cQTLs, while IL-1β and IL-1Ra 
show no cQTLs, suggesting that the immune response can buffer easier variation in IL-6 and 
IL-8, while the IL-1 pathway is highly conserved. Moreover, cQTLs are trans-QTLs that 
influence cytokine production indirectly through regulatory loops, in line with the 
observation that cytokine responses are organized around regulation of pathogen-specific 
host responses, rather than towards regulation of specific cytokines. This is in line with a 
recent study showing that 90% of causal SNPs tend to occur near binding sites for master 
regulators of stimulus-dependent gene expression and map to enhancers which gain histone 
acetylation38. One of the strongest cQTLs that we identified influences expression of the 
GOLM1 upon Candida stimulation, which in turn influences susceptibility to candidemia. 
GOLM1 encodes a Golgi phosphoprotein, also referred as GP73, which is known to respond 
to viral infections19. This molecule has also been tested as a useful circulating biomarker for 
several viral and non-viral induced liver diseases39,40 and the serum GOLM1 levels was 
shown to correlate with serum IL-6 levels in hepatocellular carcinoma41. The trans-
regulatory network of GOLM1 that we describe here provides further insights into the 
understanding of the GOLM1-mediated cytokine regulation, not only in cancer but also for 
infectious diseases.
There are also some limitations to the study. Firstly, we cannot exclude that cQTLs were 
missed and/or some of the cQTLs with rare allele frequencies are false positives in the 
analyses due to the relatively low number of volunteers. The same reason prevented us from 
performing a robust assessment of cQTLs of lymphocyte-derived cytokines. Secondly, the 
present study investigated cytokine levels induced by bacterial and fungal pathogens, but not 
viral stimuli. Thirdly, variation in the immune system can be driven by both heritable and 
non-heritable influences. Finally, the experimental set up of ex-vivo PBMCs stimulated for 
24 hours provides the opportunity to study the interactions between immune cells such as 
monocytes, T cells and B cells in response to pathogens. However the time-dependent 
dynamic interactions at tissue level are only partially captured. Therefore, PBMCs alone 
may not fully provide the in-vivo picture of immune response since cell-cell interactions also 
occur at specific tissue locations. Some of these remaining questions will be addressed by 
the currently ongoing analyses of a larger cohort of 500 healthy volunteers within the 
Human Functional Genomics Study, in which more volunteers, a larger panel of stimuli, and 
external factors (e.g. diet, microbiome) will be included.

Ethics statement
Samples of venous blood were drawn after informed consent was obtained, and the study 
was approved by the Ethical Committee of Radboud University Nijmegen (nr.

 200FG cohort
Individuals in this study were foresters from the ‘Geldersch Landschap’, ‘Hoge Veluwe’, 
‘Twickel’, and ‘Kroondomein het Loo’ in the Netherlands. Foresters were asked to donate 
blood in order to determine the serology against Borrelia bacteria, since Lyme disease 
occurs as an occupational disease. The cohort of individuals was chosen because of the good 
health reported by this general population. None of the volunteers included in the study had 
Borrelia infection. In this cohort, all individuals gave written informed consent to donate 
extra blood to use for research. Blood was drawn in 2009, 2011 and 2013. The foresters 
were between 23–73 years old, and consisted of 77% males and 23% females. The cQTLs 
identified were additionally validated in a cohort of 500 healthy individuals of Dutch 
European ancestry from the Human Functional genomics Project (500FG cohort, 
www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org).
PBMC collection and stimulation experiments
After obtaining informed consent, venous blood was drawn from the cubital vein of 
volunteers into 10 mL EDTA tubes (Monoject). Isolation of PBMCs was performed 
according standard protocols, with minor modifications. The PBMC fraction was obtained 
by density centrifugation of blood diluted 1:1 in pyrogen-free saline over Ficoll-Paque 
(Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were washed twice in saline and suspended in medium (RPMI 
1640) supplemented with gentamicin 10 mg/mL, L-glutamine 10 mM and pyruvate 10 mM. 
Addition of antibiotics such as gentamycin is a standard methodology used in order to avoid 
contamination of cultures, and it does not influence the ability to induce cytokine production 
by PBMCs or macrophages (data not shown). The cells were counted in a Coulter counter 
(Coulter Electronics) and the number was adjusted to 5×106 cells/mL. Then 5×105 PBMCs 
in a 100 μL volume were added to round-bottom 96-wells plates (Greiner) and incubated 
with 100 μL of stimulus. After 24 h the supernatants were collected and stored at −20°C 
until assayed. The stimulation time periods were chosen based on extensive previous studies 
that showed that 24 h stimulation was best suited to assess monocyte-derived cytokines42,43.
Stimulation of PBMCs
Bacteria—Bacteroides fragilis (NCTC 10584) grown anaerobically overnight at 37°C on 
blood agar plates (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was inoculated in 20 mL pre-
warmed and pre-reduced Brain Heart Infusion broth (BD Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) 
and again grown anaerobically overnight at 37 °C until reaching stationary growth phase 
mimicking growth conditions in abscesses. Bacterial suspensions were washed three times in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; B. Braun Medical B.V., Melsungen, Germany) and heat-
killed at 95°C for 30 min. Before heat-killing, aliquots of bacterial suspensions were taken 
to determine colony-forming unit (cfu) counts. Heat-killed bacteria were washed again and 
after adjusting the concentration in PBS to 1 × 108 cfu/mL, stored at −80 °C. B. fragilis was 
used in the stimulation experiments as 1×106/mL. E. coli ATCC 25922 was grown overnight 
in culture medium, washed three times with PBS, and heat-killed for 60 min at 80°C; 
Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 29213 was grown overnight in culture medium, washed 
twice with cold PBS, and heat-killed for 30 min at 100°C; both E. coli and S. aureus were

 used in a final concentration of 1×106/mL. Success of heat-inactivation was confirmed by 
cultures.
Cultures of H37Rv Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) were grown to mid-log phase in 
Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium (Difco, Becton-Dickinson) supplemented with oleic acid/
albumin/dextrose/catalase (OADC) (BBL, Becton-Dickinson), washed three times in sterile 
saline, heat killed and then disrupted using a bead beater, after which the concentration was 
measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce, Thermo Scientific).
Fungi—Heat-killed C. albicans blastoconidia (strain ATCC MYA-3573, UC 820) at a 
concentration of 106 CFU/mL were used throughout this study. To generate hyphae, live 
yeast forms of Candida were grown for 24 h at 37°C in RPMI 1640 (Gibco-BRL, Grand 
Island, NY), adjusted to pH 6.4 by using hydrochloric acid. After 24 h, more than 95% of 
blastoconidia were grown to hyphae, which were checked by microscope. Hyphae were heat 
killed for 45 min at 98°C and resuspended in RPMI 1640 to a hyphal inoculum size that 
originated from 106/mL blastoconidia (referred to as 106/mL hyphae).
Ligands – FSL-1 and Pam3Cys were purchased at EMC microcollections (L-7000, L-2000, 
respectively) and used in a final concentration of 1 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL.
Microbial ligands—MDP (muramyl dipeptide) was purchased at Sigma (A-9519) and 
used at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. LPS (E. coli serotype 055:B5) was purchased 
from Sigma and an extra purification step was performed as described previously44. Purified 
LPS was tested in TLR4−/− mice for the presence of contaminants and did not have any 
TLR4-independent activity45.
A total of 5×105 PBMCs in a total volume of 200 μL per well were incubated at 37°C in 
round-bottom 96-well plates (Greiner) with the different stimuli, as indicated above. After 
24 h (early cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10), or 7 days of incubation (IFN-γ 
and IL-17), supernatants were collected and stored at −20°C until assayed. When cells were 
cultured for 7 days, this was done in the presence of 10% human pooled serum.
Cytokine measurements
Concentrations of human cytokines determined using specific commercial ELISA kits from 
R&D Systems: IL-1β (catalog number DLB50), IL-6 (D6050), IL-10 (D1000B), TNF-α 
(DTA00C), IL-17 (D1700), or IFN-γ (DIF50) in accordance with the manufacturers’ 
instructions. Detection limits were 20 pg/mL, except for IFN-γ ELISA (12 pg/mL).
IL-6 measurements in Candidemia cohort
Concentrations of human IL-6 in the serum of candidemia patients were determined using 
specific commercial ELISA kits (PeliKine Compact or R&D Systems), in accordance with 
the manufacturers’ instructions. The data were available for 117 Caucasian candidemia 
patients. Candidemia patients were stratified on rs7036187 SNP genotype to obtain 111 AA 
and 6 AG patients. For each individual the median values of IL-6 levels measured across 15 
days were used. The statistical difference was tested using a student t test (one-sided) by

 comparing the log2 transformed IL-6 values. P value less than 0.05 was considered 
significant.
Cytokine clustering and variance analysis
Raw cytokine levels were first log-transformed, then cytokine measurements showing 
little/no variation across individuals were filtered out for the follow-up analysis. We 
excluded 9 cytokine measurements in 2009. The normality test was performed on both raw 
(Fig. 1a) and log-transformed data (Supplementary Fig. 13) using Shapiro-Wilk normality 
test, respectively. P value > 0.05 was used as threshold for normal distribution. Unsupervised 
hierarchical clustering was performed using Spearman correlation as the measure of 
similarity. In order to test the equality of variance of cytokine levels before and after 
stimulation, Levene’s test was used.
Genotyping, quality control and imputation
DNA samples of 112 individuals were genotyped using the commercially available SNP 
chip, Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome-8 v1.0. The genotype calling was performed 
using Opticall 0.7.046 using the default settings. Four samples with a call rate ≤ 0.99 were 
excluded from the dataset as were variants with a HWE ≤ 0.0001, call rate ≤ 0.99 and MAF 
≤ 0.001. Two samples were excluded as potential ethnic outliers identified by multi-
dimensional scaling plots of samples merged with 1000 Genome data (Supplementary Fig. 
14). This resulted in a dataset of 106 samples containing genotype information of 282,382 
variants for further imputation. The strands and variant-identifiers were aligned to the 
reference Genome of The Netherlands (GoNL)18 dataset using Genotype Harmonizer47. The 
data was phased using SHAPEIT2 v2.r64448 using the GoNL as a reference panel. Finally 
this data was imputed using IMPUTE249 with the GoNL as the reference panel50. Post 
imputation provided 7512899 variants. We selected 3959389 SNPs that showed MAF ≥ 5%, 
INFO score ≥ 0.8 and 3 samples per genotype for downstream cytokine QTL mapping.
Cytokine QTL mapping
Lack of either DNA or cytokine measurements for 90 individuals sampled in three different 
years restricted us to obtain both genotype and cytokine data for 107 individuals out of 197 
individuals (Supplementary Table 1). We used the 2013 dataset as a discovery cohort to 
identify genome-wide significant cQTLs since this cohort had the largest numbers of 
individuals (n=79). The 2009 (n=30) and 2011 datasets (n=78) were used as validation 
cohorts. We coded gender information either 0 for females or 1 for males. The actual age 
and coded gender information were included as co-variables in the linear model to correct 
the cytokine distributions for QTL mapping. We focused only on infectious stimulations 
such as LPS, Candida and MTB to map cQTLs, which provided 18 measurements (3 
stimulations× 6 cytokines). Since it was difficult define a numerical cut-off to filter out the 
cytokine measurements that were not informative, we visually inspected all the cytokine 
distribution plots to check if the cytokine measurements provide clear variation across 
individuals (Supplementary Fig. 15). By manually checking the log-transformed cytokine 
distributions, we excluded one measurement (MTB-induced TNF-α) from further QTL 
mapping as this cytokine measurement showed very little variation (low production capacity 
in the majority of individuals), and was thus not informative (Supplementary Fig. 2). Raw

 cytokine levels were first log-transformed then mapped to genotype data using a linear 
regression model with age and gender as covariates. A P value < 5×10−8 was considered to 
be the threshold for significant cytokine QTLs. In order to check whether our QTL mapping 
indicated any significant inflation of test statistics due to population structure, we calculated 
genetic inflation factor lambda (observed vs. expected P values) for all cytokine 
measurements. We found that the lambda values were around 1 (0.99 to 1.04) indicating 
there is no or very little population stratification (Supplementary Fig. 16). Since the different 
amounts of cytokine production can also be driven by different immune cell counts in 
PBMC preparations, we tested whether cQTLs can influence the cytokine levels independent 
of different cell counts. For this we focused on Candida-induced cQTLs and made use of the 
FACS assessment in the 500 Functional Genomics study (500FG cohort), in which cell 
populations are examined in detail. We obtained cell count data measured by FACS for total 
lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, monocytes and NK cells from 487 individuals from the 500FG 
cohort. We measured IL-6 and TNF-α levels in response to Candida stimulation to check if 
the Candida-induced cQTLs can be replicated after cell counts correction.
RNA sequencing and expression analysis
Candidate genes from significant cytokine QTL loci were further tested if they responded to 
any of the pathogens using RNA seq data from PBMCs of eight individuals, which were 
stimulated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and IL-1alpha. The PBMCs from 70 
individuals of the GONL cohort18 were stimulated with or without Candida albicans as 
previously described51. Sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome using STAR 
(version 2.3.0)52. The aligner was provided with a file containing junctions from Ensembl 
GRCh37.71. Htseq-count of the Python package HTSeq (version 0.5.4p3) was used (The 
HTSeq package, http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/overview.html) to 
quantify the read counts per gene based on annotation version GRCh37.71, using the default 
union-counting mode. Differentially expressed genes were identified by statistics analysis 
using DESeq2 package from bioconductor53. The statistically significant threshold (FDR P 
≤ 0.05 and Fold Change ≥ 2) was applied. Gender and age were included as known 
covariates in a linear model for assessing genotype effect. All eQTL mapping was done 
using Matrix-eQTL54. To build co-expression networks, we extracted top 25 co-expressed 
genes for top 20 differentially expressed genes in Candida-stimulation experiment and 
performed the pathway enrichment analysis on these gene-sets. Then, we compared whether 
these genes are also enriched for IL-6 signaling similar to GOLM1 co-expressed genes 
(Supplementary Fig. 11a). In addition, we extracted the co-expressed genes with GOLM1 
and ranked them according to their co-expression correlation values with GOLM1. We 
performed pathway enrichment analysis on top 50 (r2 with GOLM1 > 0.7), middle 50 (r2 
with GOLM1 between 0.7–0.4), bottom 50 (r2 with GOLM1 < 0.2) and randomly chosen 50 
genes. Then, we tested if the enrichment for IL-6 signaling is dependent on the strength of 
the co-expression with GOLM1 (Supplementary Fig. 11b).
Extraction of infectious disease associated SNPs
SNPs associated with a number of infectious diseases that showed P value < 9.99×10−6 were 
extracted using the GWAS catalogue (http:/www.genome.gov/gwasstudies). As of December

 2014, there were two studies on leprosy, two studies on malaria, four studies on tuberculosis, 
four studies on chronic hepatitis C infection, one study on HPV seropositivity, one study on 
Dengue shock syndrome and one study on meningococcal susceptibility. By systematic 
search in the literature, SNPs associated with susceptibility to additional infectious diseases 
not reported in the GWAS catalogue were also extracted. There were three studies on 
invasive aspergillosis and two studies on pneumococcal disease (Supplementary Table 7). 
The infectious disease associated SNPs shown in Fig. 6 are rs1519551, rs4833095, 
rs3132468, rs9271858, rs16948876, rs3764147, rs11036238, rs9940464, rs6755404, 
rs958617, rs6545883, rs1900442, rs8005962, rs1925714, rs4331426, rs2505675, rs160441, 
rs1948632, rs6538140, and rs9373523.
GWAS SNP extraction and enrichment analysis
GWAS SNPs from the GWAS catalog21 and their proxies (r2 ≥ 0.8 from 500kb window) 
were first extracted, which provided a list of SNPs associated to 122 different human traits 
and diseases. We selected diseases/traits for which at least 10 independent SNPs were 
reported to be associated. We then binned these GWAS SNPs into eight categories based on 
their association to closely related human phenotypes (cancer, immune-mediated diseases, 
infectious disease, heart-related traits, blood-related traits, metabolic traits, height and Type 
2 diabetes related traits). Duplicated SNPs are removed from further analysis. We then 
intersected the SNPs of each category with cQTLs that showed P < 0.05 in our study. The 
Fisher exact test was applied to test the over-representation cQTL SNPs in infectious disease 
SNPs using the height associated SNPs as reference.
