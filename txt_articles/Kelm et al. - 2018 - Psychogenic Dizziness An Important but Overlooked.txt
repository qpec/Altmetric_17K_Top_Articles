Chronic dizziness can be challenging for both patients and physicians, as a
variety of specialists may be consulted and tests ordered before a diagnosis
is established. The various potential etiologic processes involved in chronic
dizziness require an interdisciplinary approach to care. Common causes
include neurologic, vestibular, and cardiac diseases. Psychiatric disorders,
however, may be overlooked when establishing a differential diagnosis. This
case report illustrates some of the complexities in diagnosing and effectively
managing chronic dizziness and serves as a reminder that psychiatric disor-
ders should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

izziness is a common symptom reported by patients that can be challenging for
physicians because of the wide array of potential causes. While primary care
and emergency physicians see many cases of new-onset dizziness, patients
with persistent or chronic dizziness may often be referred to other specialty physicians,
such as neurologists, otolaryngologists, and cardiologists. Dizziness is a nonspecific
term that can fall into a number of broad categories, such as vertigo, presyncope, disequi-
librium, and nonspecific dizziness.1
Vertigo, the most common type of dizziness, refers to the illusion of movement, which
may involve the perception of self-motion, environmental motion, and, often, a spinning
sensation.1 Symptoms made worse with head movement and the presence of nystagmus
strongly suggest vertigo. Vertigo may be of peripheral (eg, benign paroxysmal positional
vertigo, labyrinthitis, vestibular neuronitis, Meniere disease) or central (eg, brainstem or
cerebellar ischemia) origin.1,2
Presyncope is another form of dizziness and a prodromal symptom of near fainting.
Patients may report nearly “blacking out,” lightheadedness, diaphoresis, feelings of
warmth, and blurry vision. It usually lasts seconds to minutes and typically occurs with the
patient seated upright or standing. Patients with presyncope often have a history of diabetes
or cardiac disease, such as coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure.1,3
Disequilibrium refers to the perception of imbalance that primarily occurs when
walking. It is frequently seen in elderly persons and can be caused by Parkinson
disease, peripheral neuropathy, musculoskeletal disorders, medications (eg, benzodiaze-
pines, tricyclic antidepressants, anticholinergics), and other neurologic disorders.1

 With nonspecific dizziness, patients may use vague
terms or find it difficult to describe their symptoms.
They may insist on the term dizziness or rely on other
descriptors, such as lightheadedness, giddiness, faint-
ing, or a spinning sensation. Many patients with non-
specific dizziness and vague symptoms may have an
underlying psychiatric disorder.1,4
Although neurologic, vestibular, and cardiac diseases
are common causes of dizziness, it is important to rec-
ognize that psychiatric disorders are quite pervasive
and a common cause as well. Studies in a variety of
health care settings, including primary care clinics,5
emergency departments,6 and specialized dizziness
clinics,7 indicate that psychiatric disorders are present
in approximately 15% of patients presenting with dizzi-
ness. After vestibular disorders, they may be the
second-most common cause of persistent dizziness.5
The current case describes a patient with chronic diz-
ziness. A review of the literature on the relationship
between chronic dizziness and psychiatric disorders, as
well as suggestions for physicians, are also provided.
Report of Case
A 55-year-old African American woman presented
with a chief complaint of dizziness to the otolaryngol-
ogy clinic. She had been referred by a neurologist. The
patient had a myocardial infarction (MI) 1 year previ-
ously, and since that time experienced constant, persist-
ent dizziness with episodic bouts of “room-spinning”
vertigo. She described her constant dizziness as “just
dizzy all day, every day,” but said that positional
changes, such as bending over or standing up too
quickly, made it worse. The episodes of vertigo were
preceded by a flulike prodrome consisting of diaphor-
esis, nausea, and numbness and tingling in her hands
and feet. In 2 instances, she stated that she briefly lost
consciousness. These episodes typically occurred
twice per month, lasting from 5 minutes to a few
hours, and were relieved by intravenous diazepam in
the emergency department on at least 1 occasion.
Meclizine was ineffective. The patient denied asso-
ciated chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, headaches,
hearing loss, tinnitus, otalgia, aural pressure, or facial
weakness. Findings from previous workups from a car-
diologist and a neurologist were unremarkable, includ-
ing normal orthostatic measurements, normal findings
on Dix-Hallpike testing, and a normal magnetic reson-
ance image of the brain.
In addition to her MI and subsequent percutaneous
coronary intervention with the placement of 2 stents,
the patient’s medical history was notable for multiple
ear infections as a child and posttraumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD). Her medications included 81 mg of
aspirin once daily, 40 mg of atorvastatin once daily, 75
mg of clopidogrel once daily, 5 mg of escitalopram
once daily, 500 mg of ranolazine twice daily, and 20
mg of trospium twice daily. She lived alone and had to
stop working because of her persistent symptoms.
Physical examination revealed the patient to be alert
and oriented, with normal mood and cognition. The
HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat) examin-
ation demonstrated that the head was normocephalic
and atraumatic. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light. Eye movements were normal without evidence
of nystagmus. External auditory canals were patent and
clear of debris. Tympanic membranes were intact,
mobile, and without middle effusion. Nose and throat
examination findings were also normal. A neurologic
examination revealed that cranial nerves II to XII were
intact bilaterally. There was no evidence of dysarthria
or short- or long-term memory deficits. Muscle tone
was normal in all muscle groups, strength was +5/5 in
the upper and lower extremities, and reflexes were +2/
4 bilaterally. Finger-to-nose testing showed no abnor-
malities, no evidence of pronator drift was found, and
gait was fluid and stable. On osteopathic structural
examination, increased tension was noted throughout
the cervical region, particularly in the upper cervical
vertebrae. C3 was found to be extended, rotated, and
sidebent left. The remainder of the examination find-
ings were unremarkable. Audiogram and tympanome-
try results were normal. To more definitively rule out a
vestibular origin, videonystagmography was used and

 yielded a normal result. Given these findings, our dif-
ferential diagnosis included an underlying psychiatric
cause (eg, PTSD, anxiety disorder, depression, or
somatic symptom and related disorders), cardiac cause,
or iatrogenic cause (eg, aspirin, escitalopram, ranola-
zine, or trospium). We informed the patient that an
organic otologic cause was ruled out and suggested
that she follow up with her primary care physician and
to continue to follow up with her neurologist and
cardiologist.
Discussion
This case demonstrates some of the challenges that face
otolaryngologists and other physicians when a patient
presents with dizziness. It may be difficult in some
instances for physicians to elucidate the exact nature of
the dizziness (eg, vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium,
nonspecific) when taking a history. In the current case,
the patient depicted a chronic, constant dizziness that
was difficult to describe and repeated vertiginous epi-
sodes with nausea, diaphoresis, and flulike symptoms.
The patient’s history of MI, timing of onset of her diz-
ziness symptoms, and report of syncope associated with
the vertiginous episodes also added to the complexity
of the case. The clinical picture was even further com-
plicated by the patient’s psychiatric history and her use
of multiple medications that could have caused or con-
tributed to her dizziness symptoms.
On further reflection and a review of the literature,
multiple elements of the current case suggest an under-
lying psychiatric disorder. First, the patient described
symptoms of chronic dizziness. Not only did the
patient complain of repeated vertiginous episodes that
occurred over the span of months, but also constant,
unremitting dizziness that was difficult to describe and
persisted for about a year. Dizziness that is both
chronic and nonspecific in nature should alert a phys-
ician to a possible psychiatric cause.1,8-10 Second, the
patient had a history of PTSD managed with escitalo-
pram. Studies suggest that PTSD has been associated
with ill-defined somatic symptoms, such as unex-
plained dizziness.10-13 A known history of a psychiatric
disorder should provide an early clinical clue to the
physician. Up to 28% of patients with dizziness have
reported symptoms of an anxiety disorder,14 and 1 in 4
patients with dizziness may meet criteria for panic dis-
order.15 Additionally, patients with an anxious, intro-
verted personality trait have been reported to be at
increased
risk
for
chronic
subjective
dizziness
(CSD).16 Although our patient did not have a known
history of an anxiety disorder, patients with PTSD
exhibit high rates of psychiatric comorbidity. Anxiety
disorders are 2 to 4 times more prevalent in patients
with PTSD,17 and somatic symptom disorder is 90
times more likely in patients with PTSD.18 Also, the
patient stated that her more severe dizziness episodes
were only relieved with intravenous diazepam, a medi-
cation known to improve symptoms of anxiety.19
Thus, the complex and at times vague description of
symptoms, chronic course, history of a psychiatric dis-
order, and relief of episodes with a benzodiazepine
should raise a physician’s suspicion that the patient’s
dizziness is caused, or at least in part affected, by a psy-
chiatric disorder.
Given the often complex nature of presentation and
the notion that psychiatric disorders could be either a
cause or consequence of dizziness, researchers have
sought to better understand the relationship between
chronic
dizziness
and
psychiatric
disorders.
Ruckenstein and Staab10 attempted to more precisely
define the term psychogenic dizziness, and they intro-
duced the clinical entity chronic subjective dizziness,
which, according to Holle et al,20 has been renamed
persistent postural-perceptual dizziness and will be
included
in
the
11th
revision
of
International
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems. Patients with CSD present with a
similar symptom complex involving a persistent (most
days for >3 months) sensation of nonvertiginous dizzi-
ness that may include at least 1 of these vague descrip-
tors: heavy headedness, lightheadedness, a feeling of
imbalance, a feeling that the floor is moving, or a
feeling of disassociation from one’s environment. In

 addition, patients with CSD may exhibit chronic hyper-
sensitivity to their own motion or the motion of objects
in the environment, and their symptoms may be wor-
sened by complex visual stimuli (eg, crowded places).
Ruckenstein and Staab9 found that 93% of patients
with CSD had a psychiatric disorder, particularly
anxiety disorder, that significantly contributed to their
symptoms. Of note, only one-third of these patients
had a primary anxiety disorder and no history of ves-
tibular disorder or another disease that could cause diz-
ziness.10,21 Another one-third of patients with CSD
had no history of a psychiatric disorder but had a neu-
rootologic illness (eg, benign paroxysmal positional
vertigo) that precipitated the onset of anxiety (otogenic
CSD). The final one-third had a history of an anxiety
or other psychiatric disorder, experienced an acute oto-
genic event or other medical condition that triggered
dizziness, and then developed a worsening of the pre-
existing psychiatric disorder that resulted in CSD
symptoms (interactive CSD). The authors asserted that
regardless of CSD subtype, symptoms persisted if the
underlying psychiatric disorder was not addressed.
Thus, in patients with CSD, managing the underlying
psychiatric disorder may be critical to therapeutic
success.
Effective management of CSD or a psychogenic
cause of dizziness seems to be multifactorial. Research
suggests that patient education can be a key first step
in the therapeutic process.9,22 Physicians who suspect
CSD or a psychogenic origin should discuss psycho-
social issues with these patients and the ways in which
psychiatric disorders and stress can cause or exacerbate
chronic dizziness. For instance, a physician can initiate
this conversation by focusing on the topic of stress: “In
many patients, stress can also contribute to or worsen
dizziness. How has stress affected your life recently?”
These discussions can lay the foundation for successful
treatment and, if necessary, psychiatric referral. Second,
the mainstay of CSD management is pharmacotherapy
with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
Studies indicate that these medications are effective in
managing CSD.23-25 Approximately 50% of patients
given an SSRI had complete remission of symptoms,
and
70%
demonstrated
a
positive
effect.23-25
Physicians should recognize and counsel patients that
SSRIs can cause an initial increase in anxiety symp-
toms and thus should initially be taken at low doses,
with a slow titration. Of note, in the aforementioned
study,10 patients with the interactive subtype of CSD
did not respond as well to SSRIs. This finding appears
relevant to the current case, as the patient may have
had this form of CSD, given her history of PTSD and
the
onset
of
chronic
dizziness
after
her
MI.
Furthermore, the patient had persistent symptoms
despite taking 5 mg of escitalopram, although this
dose may have been subtherapeutic. Other research
indicates that psychotherapeutic techniques, such as
cognitive behavioral therapy, may also benefit patients
with CSD.10,26,27
Osteopathic Considerations
A whole-person approach is emphasized in osteopathic
philosophies, through which the union of body, mind,
and spirit is recognized.28 Given this principle, the
apparent relationship between chronic dizziness and
psychiatric disorders should not be surprising. A whole-
person approach to patient care can help physicians rec-
ognize that patients with chronic dizziness, particularly
CSD, are often frustrated.10 Often, these patients have
seen several physicians and undergone multiple diag-
nostic tests and therapeutic trials for their symptoms,
as exhibited in the current case. These patients may be
disappointed by an absent diagnosis and ineffective
prior treatments. Physicians in any specialty who
possess a strong working knowledge of how psychiatric
disorders can affect or cause chronic dizziness will be
better equipped to help their patients. Furthermore,
taking a whole-person approach to patients, gathering
thorough psychosocial histories, and providing high-
level compassion and respect for these patients can
promote more effective clinical encounters and ultim-
ately contribute to better outcomes.28 The interrelation-
ships between structure and function are also applicable
to patients with chronic dizziness. As seen in the

 current case, the patient exhibited cervical dysfunction
on physical examination. Research suggests that neck
pain can be associated with psychiatric disorders.29
Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) could be
an advantageous adjunctive therapy, as studies have
indicated that OMT (eg, craniosacral techniques, cer-
vical techniques) can improve anxiety, depression,
autonomic nervous system function, and dizziness.30-34
Limitations and Future Directions
The present case describes a patient whom we suspect
meets the criteria for psychogenic CSD. However, the
case is greatly limited by the fact that the patient was
lost to follow-up. Our next step would have been to
have a detailed discussion with the patient about her
psychosocial history and recommend that she follow-up
with a psychiatrist. Additionally, no OMT was applied .
Thus, we were unable to assess whether a treatment
approach consistent with a CSD diagnosis would be
effective.
We believe that our case demonstrates that physicians
who are faced with a complex case of chronic dizziness,
particularly primary care physicians, otolaryngologists,
neurologists, cardiologists, and psychiatrists, should
consider the presence of underlying psychiatric disor-
ders. Future case studies should strive to discuss the
impact of evidence-based treatment approaches for
CSD. Although research into chronic dizziness and
psychiatric disorders has greatly progressed, more
studies are necessary to uncover the underlying physio-
logic mechanisms that mediate CSD. Finally, we advo-
cate for heightened awareness of and education about
factors contributing to chronic dizziness, particularly
as persistent postural-perceptual dizziness is added to
the
11th
revision
of

Problems.
Conclusion
The patient’s complex and nonspecific symptoms, per-
sistent course, history of PTSD, and relief with a benzo-
diazepine all suggest that a psychiatric disorder may
have contributed to the chronic dizziness. Physicians,
regardless of specialty, should be mindful that psychi-
atric conditions can be a relatively common source of
or contributor to chronic dizziness. Moreover, physi-
cians who are well versed in psychogenic factors and
their relationship with chronic dizziness will not only
be more adept at recognizing this cause but also be
better able to effectively treat these patients. Like
many situations in medicine, maintaining an osteo-
pathic, whole-person approach that considers psycho-
social factors can greatly benefit patients with chronic
dizziness.
