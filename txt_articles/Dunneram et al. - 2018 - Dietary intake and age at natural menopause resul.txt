background Age at natural menopause is a matter of 
concern for women of reproductive age as both an early 
or late menopause may have implications for health 
outcomes.
Methods Study participants were women aged 40–65 
years who had experienced a natural menopause from 
the UK Women’s Cohort Study between baseline and 
first follow-up. Natural menopause was defined as the 
permanent cessation of menstrual periods for at least 
12 consecutive months. A food frequency questionnaire 
was used to estimate diet at baseline. Reproductive 
history of participants was also recorded. Regression 
modelling, adjusting for confounders, was used to 
assess associations between diet and age at natural 
menopause.
results During the 4-year follow-up period, 914 
women experienced a natural menopause. A high 
intake of oily fish and fresh legumes were associated 
with delayed onset of natural menopause by 3.3 years 
per portion/day (99% CI 0.8 to 5.8) and 0.9 years per 
portion/day (99% CI 0.0 to 1.8), respectively. Refined 
pasta and rice was associated with earlier menopause 
(per portion/day: −1.5 years, 99% CI −2.8 to −0.2). 
A higher intake of vitamin B6 (per mg/day: 0.6 years, 
99% CI 0.1 to 1.2) and zinc (per mg/day: 0.3 years, 
99% CI −0.0 to 0.6) was also associated with later age 
at menopause. Stratification by age at baseline led to 
attenuated results.
Conclusion Our results suggest that some food groups 
(oily fish, fresh legumes, refined pasta and rice) and 
specific nutrients are individually predictive of age at 
natural menopause.
InTroduCTIon
The average age of menopause in the UK is reported 
to be 51 
years.1 Menopause is an important phase 
in a woman’s life indicating the end of the repro-
ductive life span with reduction in oestrogen and 
increased progesterone levels.2 3 Several studies 
have documented an association between earlier 
age at natural menopause and lower bone density, 
osteoporosis, depression and premature death.4 5 
Other studies have shown increased risk of cardio-
vascular and coronary diseases.6 7 In contrast, a late 
menopause has been associated with a higher risk 
for breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers.8
A number of causes have been postulated for the 
relationship between age at menopause and these 
health outcomes, such as genetic factors, behavioural 
and environmental exposures, socio-demographic 
factors, hormonal mechanisms and health-related 
factors.9 Diet can also be an underlying factor.9 T
wo 
large cohort studies have also hypothesised an asso-
ciation10 11 but reported conflicting findings.
The limited number of studies and contradic-
tory results10–12 in this area suggests the need for 
further cohort studies with detailed dietary intake 
measures to clarify this association. The aim of this 
analysis was to explore the associations between 
food groups and nutrient intake in a large cohort of 
British women with age at incident natural meno-
pause. We hypothesised that intake of healthier 
food groups such as fruits and vegetables would be 
associated with an earlier menopause while a high 
consumption of meat and processed meat would 
delay the onset of menopause.
MeThods
study population
The UK Women’s Cohort Study (UKWCS) is a large 
prospective study consisting of 35 
372 women aged 
between 35 and 69 years. Recruited participants 
were from England, Scotland and Wales.13 Baseline 
data were collected between the years 1995 and 
1998 via postal questionnaire. Follow-up data were 
collected on average 4 years later, between the years 
1999 and 2002.13
study design and data collection
In total, 14 
172 women who participated at both 
baseline and follow-up were considered for this 
study. Information was collected on demographic 
details, weight history, physical activity, repro-
ductive history (age at last period; number of 
periods in last 12 
months; use of hormone replace-
ment therapy (HRT)), anthropometric and other 
health-related factors at baseline as well as at 
follow-up. Participants who experienced a natural 
menopause at follow-up were identified through 
comparison of baseline and follow-up data. Natural 
menopause was defined as the permanent cessation 
of the menstrual periods for at least 12 consecu-
tive months.2 Menstruating women, that is, those 
having one or more menstrual period in the last 
12 
months at baseline and who became naturally 
postmenopausal at follow-up were included in 
the final analysis. Inclusion criteria also comprised 
never used HRT at baseline and currently not using 
HRT at follow-up (as HRT use may influence the 
bleeding pattern among premenopausal women14). 
Women who ever used HRT after reaching meno-
pause at phase II were also included. Women who 
had bilateral oophorectomy and hysterectomy at 
baseline as well as pregnant women at baseline were 
excluded from the study. In addition, only women 
with an age at natural menopause between ≥40 
and

≤65 
years were included (as no menstruation before the age of 
40 might be chemically induced or due to surgical procedures). 
In addition, participants with missing data on the main study 
outcome, age at natural menopause and confounders were also 
excluded from the study (figure 1).
dietary assessment
Dietary assessment at baseline involved a detailed 217-item food 
frequency questionnaire (FFQ) derived from the FFQ which 
was validated on a subsample of 303 cohort subjects against a 
4-day food diary as well as fasting blood measures of specific 
nutrients.13 15 16 Using the different frequency categories of the 
FFQ, the number of daily portions for the 217 food items was 
defined. These were consequently converted into weight of each 
food consumed per day based on the Food Standards Agency 
portion sizes book.17 For the current study, the individual food 
items were collated into food groups according to their culi-
nary uses (eg, Mediterranean vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, 
citrus family fruits) and nutrient profile (eg, fat or fibre content) 
(online supplementary table 1). In total, 15 food items were 
considered individually. Seven food items were considered indi-
vidually due to their specific nutrient profile such as textured 
vegetable proteins, oily fish, shellfish, grapes, herbal tea, tea and 
wines, which have antioxidant properties and might separately 
affect age at natural menopause. The remaining eight food items 
(eg, tomatoes, sauces, low calorie salad cream, etc) were consid-
ered indivdually because they could not be collated under any 
of the other food groups. Furthermore, in order to have a better 
estimate for the difference in mean age at natural menopause 
across the different food groups, results were presented per 
portion size.
Covariate assessment
A directed acyclic graph (DAG) (online supplementary figure 
1) with diet (food groups) as the main exposure and age at 
natural menopause (continuous) as the outcome was generated 
to determine confounding variables. Based on available litera-
ture and data collected, potential confounding variables (age, 
parity, energy intake, body mass index (BMI), social class, age 
at first full-term pregnancy, age at menarche, smoking, alcohol 
consumption and physical activity) were included in the DAG. 
According to the minimal sufficiency set of adjustments, phys-
ical activity (MET-hours/week), smoking status (current vs not 
current smoker), alcohol consumption (g/day) and social class 
(routine and manual, intermediate, professional and managerial) 
were identified as confounders and were thus adjusted for in the 
regression models. For the associations between nutrient intake 
and age at natural menopause, total energy intake was also 
adjusted for the non-energy-containing nutrients (women were 
excluded if they had extremely high (>6000 
kcal/day) or low 
(<500 
kcal/day) energy intake) and energy from other macronu-
trients was adjusted for specific macronutrients.
statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to explore the socio-demographic 
and obstetric history of the women. Linear regression models 
were used to determine the relationships between the various 
food groups (continuous exposure in g/day) as well as nutrients 
(continuous exposure) and age at natural menopause (contin-
uous outcome in years). In addition, because younger women at 
baseline have less chance of a later menopause we evaluated the 
associations by stratifying on age at baseline (≤50 
vs >50 
years). 
An estimate >0 was considered as a later age at natural meno-
pause. Assumptions for linear regression were checked by plot-
ting the residuals against fitted values which showed a constant 
variance and a histogram demonstrated a normal distribution 
of the residuals. Due to the differences in age at natural meno-
pause by vegetarian status and parity as evidenced by previous 
studies,10 18 sensitivity analysis exploring that relationship was 
undertaken stratified by vegetarian status and parity (nulliparous

influence both diet and age at natural menopause, we also 
adjusted for diabetes. To take account of multiple testing, the

socio-demographic characteristics
Of the 1874 women who were premenopausal at baseline survey 
(and had self-reported age at natural menopause at follow-up), 
914 had become postmenopausal at 4-year follow-up. Baseline 
characteristics of the participants are outlined in table 1. The 
mean age at natural menopause at follow-up was 50.5 
years 
(95% 
CI 50.3 to 50.8). Participants had a mean BMI of 23.9 
kg/
m2 (95% 
CI 23.6 to 24.1) and 9.6% were categorised as obese. 
Physical activity level was quite low among the participants with 
a mean of 15 
min/day. This study also included 38% vegetarian 
participants. Most of the women were married, parous and 
of professional and managerial class. In this study, only 8% of 
women smoked and the mean alcohol consumption was 9 
g/day 
(around one unit).
Association between food groups and age at natural 
menopause
An increase in portion size of refined pasta and rice as well as 
savoury snacks was associated with an earlier age at natural 
menopause by 1.8 years (99% 
CI −3.0 to −0.5) and 0.9 years 
(99% 
CI −1.7 to −0.1), respectively in the unadjusted model 
(table 2). In the adjusted model, for each additional portion of 
oily fish and fresh legumes, age at menopause was increased by 
3.3 years (99% 
CI 0.8 to 5.8) and 0.9 years (99% 
CI 0.0 to 1.8), 
respectively. On the other hand, a higher intake of refined pasta 
and rice (per portion/day: 1.5 years; 99% 
CI −2.8 to −0.2) was 
associated with an earlier menopause. Stratification by age at 
baseline led to reduced associations between the various food 
groups and age at natural menopause. The CIs were wider 
because of the smaller samples in these subgroups.
For the association between nutrients and age at natural 
menopause, a later age at natural menopause by approximately 
0.6 years was found with a higher intake of vitamin B6 per 
mg (99% 
CI 0.1 to 1.2). Similarly, a higher intake of zinc was 
associated with a delayed age at natural menopause by 0.3 years 
per mg (99% 
CI −0.0 to 0.6) (table 3). Stratification by age at 
baseline further demonstrated that a higher intake of carbohy-
drates was associated with an earlier age at natural menopause 
by 0.2 years (99% 
CI −0.4 to −0.0) among women 50 years or 
below.
sensitivity analysis
Our findings demonstrated that non-vegetarians reach a natural 
menopause 0.8 
years later compared with vegetarians (99% 
CI 
0.2 to 1.4). Exploring associations for non-vegetarians alone 
showed they had an earlier age at natural menopause associated 
with an increased consumption of savoury snacks (per portion/
day: −1.7 
years, 99% 
CI −3.1 to −0.4) and soft drinks (per 
portion/day: −1.3 
years, 99% 
CI −2.5 to −0.2) while an increase 
in intake of oily fish (per portion/day: 3.4 
years, 99% 
CI 0.2 to 
6.5) and fresh legumes (per portion/day: 1.4 
years, 99% 
CI 0.2 
to 2.7) were associated with a later onset of menopause (online 
supplementary table 2).
Sensitivity analysis by parity demonstrated a difference for the 
association between the various food groups and age at natural 
menopause for nulliparous against the multiparous participants. 
In multiparous women, a later onset of age at natural menopause 
was found to be associated with an increased intake of oily fish 
(per portion/day: 3.3 
years, 99% 
CI 0.3 to 6.3) and fresh legumes 
(per portion/day: 1.1 
years, 99% 
CI 0.1 to 2.01) while an increase 
in intake of refined pasta and rice (per portion/day: −1.9 
years, 
99% 
CI −3.3 to −0.4) as well as savoury snacks (per portion/
day: −1.0 
years, 99% 
CI −2.1 to −0.0) was associated with 
an earlier age at natural menopause. For nulliparous women, 
a higher consumption of grapes (per portion/day: 2.5 
years, 
99% 
CI 0.0 to 4.9) and poultry (per portion/day: 5.2 
years, 99 
% 
CI 0.1 to 10.3) was found to be significantly associated with a 
later age at natural menopause (online supplementary table 3).
Further adjusting the model by presence of diabetes demon-
strated no changes in our results (online supplementary table 4).

*Difference in age at natural menopause, unadjusted model (n=910).
†Difference in age at natural menopause, model adjusted for the following factors: physical activity level, alcohol consumption, smoking, social class, total energy intake (n=838).
‡Difference in age at natural menopause for those aged 50 years or below in the fully adjusted model (n=477).
§Difference in age at natural menopause for those aged above 50 years in the fully adjusted model (n=361).
approximately 4 years, 914 women went through a natural 
menopause. The mean age at natural menopause was 50.5 years 
with a median age of 51 years. We found that intakes of oily fish 
and fresh legumes were associated with later age at menopause 
and intake of refined pasta/rice was associated with an earlier 
menopause. Only a few previous studies have reported diet in 
relation to age at natural menopause with a limited number of 
food items/groups included.10 12 Previous research has mainly 
been focused on the relationship between socio-demographic as 
well as lifestyle factors (education status, marital status, parity, 
etc) and age at natural menopause.18–21
Our results demonstrate that each additional increment in 
fresh legumes portion/day was associated with a later age at 
natural menopause by 0.9 
years. Fresh legumes are a good 
source of antioxidants, which can partly explain this associa-
tion. This has been supported by the biochemical and molecular 
analyses undertaken by Matamoros et al.22 Similarly, in a Japa-
nese prospective study the antioxidant properties of green and 
yellow vegetables were postulated for the association between a 
higher intake of the green and yellow vegetables and a later age 
at natural menopause.12 Oocyte maturation, ovulation, luteol-
ysis and follicle atresia are affected by reactive oxygen species 
(ROS). Phenolic compounds, vitamins and carotenoids in vege-
tables counteract the ROS and may thus decrease the proportion 
of follicles undergoing follicular atresia.23 24 Further support of 
this theory from our findings was a later age at natural meno-
pause with a high intake of vitamin B6 and zinc as both of these 
have antioxidant properties.23 25 Likewise, Stepaniack et al26 
demonstrated an association between use of vitamin and mineral 
supplements and a later menopause.
Our findings demonstrate a later age at natural menopause 
by approximately 3 
years for each additional portion/day of oily 
fish. However, in contrast to our findings, a recent review article 
as well as a 10-year follow-up study reported an earlier onset of 
menopause with high intake of polyunsaturated fats.27 28 Nagel 
et al10 reported no association between fish intake and age at 
natural menopause but it was not clear if oily fish was considered 
separately. Oily fish is a rich source of the omega-3 fatty acid 
which can potentially improve antioxidant capacity.29 Therefore, 
in a similar way to the fresh legumes and vitamins described 
above, the antioxidant properties exerted by the oily fish intake 
could possibly offset ROS, therefore decreasing the proportion 
of follicles undergoing follicular atresia and delaying onset of 
natural menopause.
In the present study, increasing refined pasta and rice consump-
tion was associated with an earlier age at natural menopause. 
The EPIC-Heidelberg study also reported a similar association.10 
High consumption of refined carbohydrates (classified as high 
glycaemic index foods) increases the risk of insulin resistance. 
Insulin resistance can lead to decreased sex hormone binding 
globulin levels (SHBG) as a result of the inhibitory effect of 
insulin on the SHBG production in the liver30 as well as increased 
oestrogen levels.31 High oestrogen levels cause release of the 
luteinising hormones which triggers ovulation, which might 
imply more cycles and rapid depletion of oocytes, consequently 
leading to an earlier menopause.32 This can be supported by a 
recent review study which reported that women with type II 
diabetes mellitus tend to have an earlier menopause although 
additional evidence is required to clarify this association.33
Although we found that fresh legumes are associated with a 
later menopause, our study further demonstrated that women 
who were vegetarian had an earlier age at natural menopause 
compared with non-vegetarians. This finding is in line with other 
studies which also reported an earlier age at natural menopause 
among vegetarians.34 35 The vegetarian diet, which normally 
consist of high fibre and no animal fat-containing foods, may 
affect the levels of the luteinising hormone, follicle stimulating 
hormone and the length of the menstrual cycle.36 Previous studies

research report
What is already known on this subject
 
► Several factors including socio-demographic and reproductive 
factors are associated with age at natural menopause. 
Limited existing studies present conflicting evidence between 
diet and age at natural menopause.
What this study adds
 
► This is the first study to our knowledge which demonstrated 
that dietary intake affected age at natural menopause in a 
prospective cohort of British women. This study shows that 
high intakes of oily fish, fresh legumes as well as vitamin 
B6 and zinc are associated with a later onset of natural 
menopause while a high consumption of refined pasta and 
rice is associated with an earlier age at natural menopause.
have demonstrated that high fibre and decreased fat intakes were 
both associated with a lower oestrogen level, which may account 
for the earlier age at natural menopause among vegetarians.37 38 
However, caution should be taken in interpreting this finding as 
vegetarian status was self-reported in this study.
It is possible that results for younger women may differ from 
those for older women. This could result from different diets 
between younger and older women,39 and that younger women 
have less opportunity to report a later menopause. To explore 
this, stratifying on age at baseline showed reduced associations 
within each subgroup.
This is the first study looking prospectively at the relationship 
between diet and age at natural menopause in the UK. Strengths 
of this study include the investigation of the association between 
individual nutrients and a wide variety of food groups and age at 
natural menopause compared with similar few previous studies. 
Careful adjustment for likely confounders was also carried out 
in the regression modelling using the DAG. A limitation of 
this prospective cohort study is that diet was reported by the 
participants using an FFQ and may thus be subjected to recall 
bias. However, FFQ enables recording of a long-term diet, thus 
showing its cumulative influence on the outcome while food 
diaries/24-hour recall give only a snapshot of the diet. Our 
sample was also more health conscious given the high number of 
vegetarians in our sample population and more well-off partic-
ipants than the general population as shown in the descriptive 
table (table 1). However, our study still includes women from a 
range of different background which implies that findings of this 
study may be extrapolated to other countries.
Women with an earlier menopause spend more years deprived 
from the benefits of oestrogen compared with women who 
become menopausal around the normal menopausal age range, 
which puts them at a greater risk of some future poor health 
outcomes such as osteoporosis and heart disease. On the other 
hand, women with a later onset of menopause are at greater risk 
of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers. Our findings confirm 
that diet may be associated with the age at natural menopause. 
This may be relevant at a public health level since age at natural 
menopause may have implications on future health outcomes. 
Health practitioners might thus also need to take into account 
the diet of women when dealing with menopause-related issues.
In summary, our study is the first to demonstrate that diet is 
associated with age at natural menopause in a large cohort of 
British women. Intakes of oily fish and fresh legumes were found 
to be associated with a later onset of natural menopause while 
higher intake of refined pasta and rice was associated with 
younger age at natural menopause. The nutrients vitamin B6 and 
zinc were also found to be associated with a later age at natural 
menopause. Women who were vegetarian had an earlier age at 
natural menopause compared to non-vegetarians.
