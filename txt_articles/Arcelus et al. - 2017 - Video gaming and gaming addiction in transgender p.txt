(Received: August 17, 2016; revised manuscript received: January 10, 2017; accepted: January 15, 2017)
Background: There is anecdotal clinical evidence that transgender people use the online world – such as forums and
online video gaming – for the purpose of experiencing their gender identity in a safe, non-threatening, non-alienating,
non-stigmatizing, and non-critical environment. Aims: To describe gaming behavior, degree of problematic gaming
behavior and associated factors with problematic gaming in a comparatively large group of transgender people
accessing transgender health services. Methods: Every individual referred to a national transgender health service in
the United Kingdom during a 12-month period was invited to complete a series of questionnaires to measure gaming
behavior, interpersonal functioning, severity of autistic features, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results: A
total of 245 people agreed to participate in the study with 154 (62.9%) describing themselves as current gamers.
Gaming behavior in the transgender population attending transgender health services was prevalent, but less than 1%
of them presented with clinical scores for Internet Gaming Disorder, with no differences according to gender.
Problematic gaming behavior was associated with general interpersonal problems, depression, and young age.
Discussion and conclusions: Transgender people who engage in problematic gaming behavior are younger, and
present with high interpersonal problems, and depression, which can affect a successful transition. In view of the high
levels of gaming activity in this population games that are designed to address these psychological problems may be
well received by transgender people.

INTRODUCTION
Transgender people are individuals whose gender identity
does not match the gender assigned at birth based on their
sexual
characteristics.
Transgender
women
are
those
assigned male at birth but whose gender identity is female;
and transgender men are those assigned female at birth with
a male gender identity (Ahmad et al., 2013). Some trans-
gender people may decide not to transition to their experi-
enced gender, and others choose to transition socially
without the need of gender confirming medical interventions
(GCMI) [cross-sex hormones (CSH) and/or genital surger-
ies] (Beek, Kreukels, Cohen-Kettenis, & Steensma, 2015).
However, many access transgender health services in order
to access GCMI (Bockting, Coleman, & De Cuypere, 2011).
Although previous epidemiological studies examining the
numbers of transgender people accessing transgender health
services suggest low prevalence rates (Arcelus et al., 2015),
reality is rather different. Transgender health services
around the world (in places where they are available) have
shown an increase rate of demand (De Vries, Kreukels,
T’Sjoen, Ålgars, & Mattila, 2015), which may be a reflec-
tion of the high number of people with a self-identified
transgender identity (Van Caenegem et al., 2015).
When people do wish GCMI, many (but not all) trans-
gender health services require their patients to socially
transition before such potentially irreversible interventions
are considered. For many transgender people, living as their
experienced gender without the aid of GCMI, can be a
challenge. However, it is the view of many clinicians
working in the field – including some of whom are trans-
gender themselves – that living as their experienced gender
allows individuals to test their gender identity in the real
world before the initiation of potentially irreversible treat-
ments (Wylie et al., 2014). Real life experience of gender
identity might include considerable social and interpersonal
challenges (e.g., Budge, 2013), such as disclosing one’s
gender
identity
to
others
(Gagne,
Tewksbury,
&
McGaughey, 1997; Wylie et al., 2014); facing rejection
(Koken, Bimbi, & Parsons, 2009); managing social gender
role transition (Budge, 2013; Rowniak & Chesla, 2013)

 including the occupational and personal arenas; and coping
with
discrimination
and
stigma
(Adams,
Nagoshi,
Filip-Crawford, Terrell, & Nagoshi, 2016; Clements-Nolle,
Marx, & Katz, 2006). As a consequence, transgender people
who have poor social and interpersonal skills may be more
likely to encounter difficulties when socially transitioning.
Cross-sectional studies investigating mental health pro-
blems of people attending transgender health services have
found high rates of depression and anxiety in this population
(Bouman, Claes, Marshall, et al., 2016; Dhejne, Van
Vlerken, Heylens, & Arcelus, 2016; Millet, Longworth, &
Arcelus, 2016). Research has provided evidence that psy-
chopathology in transgender people is predicted by interper-
sonal skills (Arcelus, Claes, Witcomb, Marshall, & Bouman,
2016). High levels of anxiety, low mood and poor interper-
sonal skills may hinder social gender role transition, and as a
consequence some individuals may hide themselves from the
real world (Jones, Arcelus, Bouman, & Haycraft, 2017), and
only explore their gender identity in online environments.
There is anecdotal clinical evidence that transgender
people use the online world – such as forums and online
video gaming – for the purpose of experiencing their
gender identity in a safe, non-threatening, non-alienating,
non-stigmatizing, and non-critical environment (Griffiths,
Bouman, & Arcelus, 2016). The online world (including
online gaming) may be used by transgender individuals as a
preliminary, complementary, and/or alternative medium for
helping them to negotiate their gendered status. Such online
games and forums may typically involve creating an avatar
that aligns with the gender they are experiencing. This could
be so for transgender men and women in the same way as
both may benefit from experiencing their gender in a safe
environment. Although video gaming activities may be
useful for transgender people to express their gender, it
may also encourage isolation and a minimum contact with
the outside world. Particularly, people with social difficul-
ties or those with some level of depression may be present-
ing with high levels of gaming behavior.
Case studies exploring gaming activity in the transgender
population have found that the use of video gaming among
this population is not unusual (Griffiths et al., 2016).
However, to date no empirical study has explored the degree
of gaming behavior in the transgender population or the
social and interpersonal factors associated with gaming
behavior. If the psychosocial characteristics of transgender
people who engage in gaming can be established, perhaps
gaming can be used therapeutically to address psychosocial
vulnerabilities (i.e., social and interpersonal difficulties) and
facilitate the person through their social transition if the
person is having difficult negotiating this in the real world.
In cisgender populations, online gaming has been found
to be an alternative way of coping with distress, as it
provides psychological benefits such as measured goal
attainment, community connection, and a sense of escapism
(Granic, Lobel, & Engels, 2014). Gaming also has the
potential to increase physical and psychological wellbeing
(Griffiths, Kuss, & Ortiz de Gortari, 2013). Gaming has
already been successfully used to tackle anxiety and
improve socialization (Rothbaum, Hodges, Smith, Lee, &
Price, 2000; Wilkinson, Ang, & Goh, 2008), including in
people on the autistic spectrum (Charlop-Christy, Le, &
Freeman, 2000). In light of these benefits, gaming could also
be particularly beneficial in the transgender population.
In summary, there is good clinical evidence of high levels
of gaming behavior in transgender people attending gender
services, which has not been reported in the literature, apart
from a case series study. As gaming can help people deal
with psychopathology, in view of the high levels of psy-
chopathology among this population, gaming can also be
used for transgender people. However, the levels of gaming
activity need to be explored first in order to evaluate whether
this method is feasible to be used among this population. In
view of this, the aims of the present study were exploratory.
The first aim is to describe gaming behavior and levels of
problematic gaming behavior in a comparatively large group
of transgender people accessing transgender health services.
Among this self-selected group of transgender people, the
second aim was to examine the characteristics that are
associated with problematic gaming behavior. In view of
the high levels of anxiety and depression levels reported in
this particular population (Dhejne et al., 2016), the high
numbers of people on the autistic spectrum who also have
transgender identities (Glidden, Bouman, Jones, & Arcelus,
2016), and the high levels of interpersonal problems already
found in these populations (Davey, Bouman, Meyer, &
Arcelus, 2015), the present study explored whether these
four factors were associated with the degree of gaming
activity found among transgender gamers.
METHODS
Participants and procedure
Every individual referred to a national transgender health
service in the United Kingdom and accepted for assessment
during a 12-month period (from June 2015 to June 2016),
was invited to participate in the study. Individuals referred
to the service are offered assessment, and possibly GCMI
(e.g., CSH, and a referral for chest reconstructive surgery,
and gender confirming genital surgery) if required. In order
for an individual to be accepted for treatment, they need to
socially transition first, which includes not only living as
their experienced gender but also changing their name and
most legal documents. Prior to the clinical assessment at the
service, patients were invited to participate in the study. If
they agreed, they completed a series of self-report psycho-
metric measurements (detailed below) and signed a consent
form.
Materials
Sociodemographics characteristics. Questions were asked
relating to age, birth assigned gender, gender description
(male; female; non-male or female; male and female; other;
and not sure), and information about social transitional
status (socially transitioned – yes or no). All sociodemo-
graphic information, including social gender role transition
status, was self-reported. No evidence (e.g., legal docu-
ments) of social transition was collected at this stage.
Information about gaming behavior. Participants were
asked to self-report information about whether or not they
22 | Journal of Behavioral Addictions 6(1), pp. 21–29 (2017)
Arcelus et al.
 engage in gaming behaviors (yes or no) and whether they
have engaged in gaming behavior in the past (yes or no).
This information was used to categorize the participants as
“current gamers” or as “non-gamers.” For the purpose of this
study, people who indicated they had previously engaged in
gaming behavior were categorized as non-gamers.
Internet Gaming Disorder Scale – Short-Form (IGDS9-
SF) (Pontes & Griffiths, 2015). The IGDS9-SF is a short
psychometric tool adapted from the DSM-5 criteria for
Internet Gaming Disorder (American Psychiatric Associa-
tion, 2013). The aim of the instrument is to assess the degree
of problematic gaming behavior. It has nine questions that
are answered using a 5-point Likert scale: 1 (“Never”),
2 (“Rarely”), 3 (“Sometimes”), 4 (“Often”), and 5 (“Very
Often”). The scores are obtained by summing the gamer’s
answers and total scores can range from 9 to 45, with higher
scores being indicative of higher degrees of gaming disor-
der. Although it is not diagnostic for the purposes of this
research, it may be possible to classify disordered gamers as
those gamers that obtain a minimum of 36 out of 45 points
(Pontes & Griffiths, 2015). The measure has excellent
validity and reliability (Pontes & Griffiths, 2015) and has
previously been used (e.g., Kim et al., 2016). The Cron-
bach’s α for the IGDS9-SF in the present study was 0.92.
Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32; Barkham,
Hardy, & Startup, 1996). The IIP-32 assesses common
interpersonal problems, across eight subscales: hard to be
assertive; hard to be sociable; hard to be supportive; hard to
be involved; too dependent; too caring; too aggressive; and
too open. The subscales are grouped into four: problems with
competition; problems with socializing; problems with nur-
turance; and problems with independence. A global score
provides an indication of overall interpersonal problems and
higher scores indicate greater interpersonal problems. The
IIP-32 is a shortened version of the original IIP, yet the
psychometric properties are retained. A confirmatory factor
analysis demonstrated high reliability with α coefficients of
0.70–0.88 (Barkham et al., 1996). The IIP-32 has been used
successfully in both non-clinical (e.g., Berry, Wearden,
Barrowclough, & Liversidge, 2006) and clinical samples
(e.g., Arcelus et al., 2009; Paley et al., 2008), including a
transgender population (Davey et al., 2015). For the present
study, the problem with socializing scale (which can provide
negative values) and the global IIP-32 were used. In the present
study, the Cronbach’s α for the global IIP-32 was 0.90, and for
the scales measuring problems socializing it was 0.82.
Hospital
Anxiety
and
Depression
Scale
(HADS)
(Zigmond & Snaith, 1983). The HADS is a commonly used
instrument to assess levels of anxiety and depression. It has
14 items and generates an overall score for depression and
for anxiety separately. Seven of the items relate to anxiety
and seven relate to depression. The HADS has been used in
clinical studies, including several with transgender people
(e.g., Bouman, Claes, Brewin, et al., 2016; Dhejne et al.,
2016). It has shown to have good test–retest and inter-rater
reliability (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983). For the present study,
both the anxiety and depression subscales were used. The
Cronbach’s α for the HADS-anxiety in the present study
was 0.85 and 0.76 for HADS-depression.
Autistic Spectrum Quotient 28 (AQ-28) (Hoekstra,
Bartels, Cath, & Boosman, 2008). The AQ-28 is a 28-item
instrument
that
was
developed
from
the
AQ-50
(Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, & Clubley,
2001). The AQ is a valuable instrument for rapidly quanti-
fying where any given individual is situated on the contin-
uum from autism to normality. The higher the score the
more autistic characteristics the individual presents with.
Both the AQ-50 and AQ-28 have shown good test–retest
and inter-rater reliability (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001;
Hoekstra et al., 2008). For the present study, the total scores
of the AQ-28 were used. The Cronbach’s α for the AQ-28 in
the present study was 0.87.
Analyses
All gaming questionnaire data were positively skewed in
both groups and non-normally distributed, as demonstrated
by significant (p < .002) Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests and
Shapiro–Wilk tests. Similarly, the rest of the data were
mostly non-normally distributed but negatively skewed in
both groups (gamers and non-gamers). Therefore, non-
parametric tests were selected where possible and regression
analyses were interpreted with caution, as there are no non-
parametric equivalents available. For the first aim of the
study, descriptive data are presented as well as mean scores
of the individual psychometric instruments. For comparison
between groups, Mann–Whitney U tests and Chi-square tests
were conducted. For the second aim of the study, a series of
one-tailed Spearman’s rho correlations were performed. The
function of this preliminary analysis was to identify which
predictor variables significantly correlated with problematic
gaming behavior and to subsequently only include these
variables in a multiple linear regression model to increase
its robustness. The enter method was used. According to
Cohen (1992) between 91 and 126 participants are required to
meet a power of 0.80 (for a medium effect size, with an α of
0.05 or 0.01) for a five-factor regression model. Statistical
significance (α) was set at p < .05. All data analyses were
performed using SPSS 22 (IBM Corporation, 2013).
Ethics
The study received ethical approval from the NHS Ethics
committee and from the Research and Development
Department of the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foun-
dation Trust in line with Health Research Authority guid-
ance (HRA, 2013).
RESULTS
Descriptive data
During the period of the study, 257 people were accepted for
the assessment at the center. Of these, 245 (95.3%) people
agreed to participate in the study. One hundred and forty-
five individuals self-identified as assigned male gender at
birth (59.2%) and 99 as assigned female gender at birth
(40.4%). One person did not identify their birth assigned
gender. Regarding gender identity, the majority of partici-
pants self-identified as being in the binary of male and
female. People, who identified as “non-male or female” and

Arcelus et al.
 those identified as “male and female” were grouped into one
category (non-binary) in Table 1. The mean age of the
total group was 27.34 years (SD = 12.48). Out of the 245
participants, 154 (62.9%) described themselves as currently
using video games (categorized as gamers), and 40 (37.1%)
as using video games in the past, but not any longer
(categorized as non-gamers for the purposes of the present
study). The remaining participants did not, and had never
played video games at all (categorized as non-gamers). In
the group categorized as gamers, on average participants
would play 9.42 times a week, 1.77 times a day and spent an
average of 2.80 hr playing on each occasion.
When comparing gamers and non-gamers, no statistical
difference was found regarding assigned gender. Gamers
were younger, single, had not socially transitioned, had
more problems socializing, higher anxiety levels, and higher
scores in the AQ-28. All the effect sizes of the between
group comparisons were considered small, apart from the
age difference between gamers and non-gamers which was
considered moderate. Only two people (0.7%) presented
with scores above 36 in the IGDS-9-SF. See Table 1 for
sociodemographics and clinical variables between gamers
and non-gamers.
Predictor data
In order to investigate predictors of problematic gaming
behavior based on the scores of the (IGDS9-SF), only the
gamers group was selected (n = 154). Spearman’s correla-
tion analysis showed a positive correlation, which was
statistically significant, between problematic gaming and
age (r = −.27, p < .001), global IIP-32 scores (interpersonal
problems)
(r = .45,
p < .001),
problems
socializing
(r = .19, p < .001), total AQ-28 (r = .37, p < .007), anxiety
scale
(r = .34,
p < .001),
and
depression
(r = .31,
p < .001) (see Table 2 for all correlations).
A multiple linear regression model was calculated to
predict problematic gaming behavior based upon the vari-
ables found to be significant (age, general interpersonal
problems, problems socializing, AQ-28 total, anxiety, and
depression). Preliminary analyses were performed to ensure
there was no violation of the assumption of linearity and
multicollinearity. The regression model for problematic
gaming behavior was found to be statistically significant
[R2 = .29, F(6) = 13.30, p < .001]. The model explained
56% of the variance in problematic gaming behavior. Age,
global IIP-32, and depression all significantly predicted
problematic gaming behavior. The main predictor of gaming
behavior was interpersonal problems. Out of the three
variables that significantly predicted problematic gaming
behavior, global IIP-32 made the largest contribution
(see Table 3).
DISCUSSION
This study aimed to examine whether transgender people
attending transgender health services engage in gaming
activities, the degree of problematic behavior, and factors
associated with problematic gaming behavior. The present
study found that contrary to previous studies, video
gaming behavior was not related to assigned gender. The
prevalence of IGD (0.7%) was much lower than in previous
studies that have examined the prevalence of online gaming
problems in nationally representative populations such as
adolescents (1.2%–8.5%) and adults (1.4%–5.4%) (Pontes,
Macur, & Griffiths, 2016). This may be because transgender
gamers use online gaming in a more functional and non-
problematic way to explore their gender identity in a safe and
non-stigmatizing
environment
(Griffiths
et
al.,
2016).
Additionally, the population selected were those attending
transgender health services and therefore able to prioritize
their needs above their gaming activity to ask for help. It may
be the case that there is still a population of transgender
people who suffer from IGD, but who are not in contact with
clinical services. The results of this study, therefore, are only
generalizable to the population of transgender people attend-
ing clinical services and wishing to transition.

Video gaming and gaming addiction in trans people
 Furthermore, differences between assigned males and
females in relation to their gaming behavior were not found.
This is contrary to previous studies among the cisgender
population which have found that being male-assigned (vs.
female) is significantly associated with both frequent and
problematic/addictive use of video games (Andreassen
et al., 2016). There are two hypotheses that present them-
selves relating to transgender individuals as a result of this
study: (a) the sex assigned at birth (and some degree of
childhood socialization) is important, and therefore birth-
assigned males would play games more frequently and have
higher levels of gaming problems than birth-assigned
females; or (b) the gender of identity is important due to
later socialization and possibly neuronal features in line with
the gender of identity and not of birth gender (e.g., Chung
et al., 2002; Zhou, Hofman, Gooren, & Swaab, 1995).
Therefore birth-assigned females would play more games
and have higher levels of gaming problems than birth-
assigned males. Further research using larger samples is
needed to further explore these hypotheses, as in the present
study only two individuals in the whole sample were
operationally defined as having a gaming addiction.
As expected, the present study also found that gaming
was more prevalent in younger groups. Although gaming
behavior in the transgender population attending transgen-
der health services appeared to be prevalent, the degree was
not high and less than 1% of them presented with clinical
scores for Internet Gaming Disorder as assessed with the
IGDS9-SF.
Problematic gaming behavior was associated with high
levels of depression, and interpersonal problems. These
psychological characteristics may explain why less than
50% of the gamers had socially transitioned by the time
they were assessed at the clinic (i.e., people with interper-
sonal problems are less likely to be able to negotiate their
social transition successfully in the real world). The high
levels of interpersonal problems found, and the association
and predictive capacity of problematic gaming may indicate
that tackling interpersonal problems through gaming could
be considered beneficial for transgender individuals who
have interpersonal difficulties. Although gaming appears
(at least initially) to be a positive and beneficial activity for
many transgender people, coping strategies developed in the
safe virtual reality world may serve as inadequate in “real
life” settings due to the diversity in virtual and “real life”
social constructs.
The association between problematic gaming behavior
and depression is not unique to the transgender population.
A large study with more than 8,000 young people found
problematic gaming behavior to be associated with an
increased risk for emotionally related symptoms, conduct
disorder, hyperactivity/inattention, self-injurious behaviors,
and problems with peers (Strittmatter et al., 2015). For
transgender people, the use of gaming as a coping mecha-
nism and as a way to avoid interpersonal interaction may
create a vicious circle where the transgender person does not
wish to move out of the secure online world, and back into
the real world, thereby making transitioning impossible for
those who wish to do so.
Some studies have also identified relationship difficulties
among the general population to be associated with high
levels of gaming behavior (Suissa, 2015). Furthermore,
spending an increasing amount of time in online gaming
carries the risk of developing a gaming dependence or
addiction (Hellman, Schoenmakers, Nordstrom, & van
Holst, 2013). This may affect one’s personal relationships,
work and/or study, and reduce the social support that can be
vital for a successful transition (Davey, Bouman, Arcelus, &
Meyer, 2014; Richards & Barker, 2013).
Transgender people have been found to present with high
levels of social anxiety (Millet et al., 2016) and anxiety
disorders (Bouman, Claes, Brewin, et al., 2016). New tech-
nologies, such as VR, which have been found to be useful
for social anxiety disorders (Kampmann, Emmelkamp, &
Morina, 2016), could be well received by this population;
these could also improve interpersonal skills and reduce
anxiety. Video games have proved to be realistic enough to
generate successful graded exposure trials against phobias of
spiders (Bouchard, Côté, St-Jacques, Robillard, & Renaud,
2006) and heights or enclosed spaces (Robillard, Bouchard,
Fournier, & Renaud, 2003) and social anxiety (Kampmann
et al., 2016). Older studies (e.g., Dewis et al., 2001) demon-
strate that while computer-aided vicarious exposure is super-
ior to the control, live-graded exposure remains superior to
both. However, in the last few years VR has improved
considerably.
The study also found that autistic traits were not associ-
ated to gaming behavior, which is surprising, as video
games have been found to be of special interest to people
with autistic features (Mazurek, Shattuck, Wagner, &
Cooper, 2012; Parsons, Leonard, & Mitchell, 2006).
The nature of the population selected (transgender people
accessing transgender health services) and the tools used
may limit the results of the present study. The findings could
not be generalized to all transgender people. Additionally,
due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, causality
cannot be determined conclusively. The strength of the
study is that it consists of a large number of transgender
people, which is unusual in most studies in the field of
transgender health. The study cannot conclude that spending
too much time gaming in accordance with experienced
gender will prevent people testing their experienced gender
in the real world, as the number of transgender participants
who initiated social gender role transition was higher among
participants currently engaged in gaming compared to par-
ticipants not currently engaged in gaming. However, the
study provides an indication that problematic gaming
behavior
is
associated
with
several
psychological
symptoms, some of which (depression and interpersonal
problems) may affect a successful transition. The findings
from this study suggest that games that are designed to help
transgender people manage these psychological symptoms
may be well received by the transgender population acces-
sing clinical services.
