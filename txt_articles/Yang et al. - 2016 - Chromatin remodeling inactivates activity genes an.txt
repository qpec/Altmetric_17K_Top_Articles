Activity-dependent transcription influences neuronal connectivity, but the roles and
mechanisms of inactivation of activity-dependent genes have remained poorly understood.
Genome-wide analyses in the mouse cerebellum revealed that the nucleosome remodeling and
deacetylase (NuRD) complex deposits the histone variant H2A.z at promoters of activity-
dependent genes, thereby triggering their inactivation. Purification of translating messenger
RNAs from synchronously developing granule neurons (Sync-TRAP) showed that conditional
knockout of the core NuRD subunit Chd4 impairs inactivation of activity-dependent genes when
neurons undergo dendrite pruning. Chd4 knockout or expression of NuRD-regulated activity
genes impairs dendrite pruning. Imaging of behaving mice revealed hyperresponsivityof granule
neurons to sensorimotor stimuli upon Chd4 knockout. Our findings define an epigenetic
mechanism that inactivates activity-dependent transcription and regulates dendrite patterning
and sensorimotor encoding in the brain.
N
euronal activity influences transcription
in neurons, and hence regulates neural
circuits (1, 2). Activity-dependent genes
are often rapidly transcribed and then
rapidly inactivated (3, 4). However, atten-
tion has focused on the induction of transcrip-
tion (1, 5–7) rather than the biological roles and
mechanisms of inactivation of activity-dependent
transcription.
Epigenetic regulators, including adenosine
5′-triphosphate (ATP)–dependent chromatin-
remodeling enzymes (8, 9), are ideally suited
to orchestrate the effects of neuronal activity on
transcription globally. The ATP-dependent nucleo-
some remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) com-
plex triggers alterations of histone modifications,
resulting in promoter or enhancer decommission-
ing and prolonged silencing of transcription (10–15).
To probe the role of the NuRD complex in
dynamic regulation of transcription in the brain,
we characterized the genome-wide occupancy of
the core NuRD ATPase-encoding subunit, Chd4,
in the mouse cerebellum. A substantial number of
regions (9842) occupied by Chd4 in the cerebellum
overlapped with transcription start sites (TSSs)
(fig. S1A). Nearly all Chd4-bound TSSs (96%)
harbored the histone modification H3K4 (histone
H3 lysine 4) trimethylation (H3K4me3), which
marks active and poised promoters (16, 17), but
not H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), which
marks inactive promoters (18) (Fig. 1A and fig.
S1, B and C). Chd4 binding at H3K4me3-enriched
TSSs was diminished in the cerebellum in mice
in which Chd4 was conditionally deleted in
granule neurons (Fig. 1, A and B, and fig. S1, D
to H). Chd4 binding at H3K4me3-enriched TSSs
in the cerebellum correlated tightly with acetyla-
tion of H3K9 and H3K14 (H3K9/14ac), which
marks actively transcribed loci (19), and with gene
expression (Fig. 1C and fig. S1I). Thus, Chd4 oc-
cupies the promoters of most actively transcribed
genes in the mouse brain.
The NuRD complex triggers the sustained re-
pression of only a small set of <200 genes in the
cerebellum through diminution of H3K9/14ac
and H3K4me3 at these promoters (13). We, there-
fore, reasoned that the NuRD complex might op-
erate through another epigenetic mechanism to
regulate the much larger set of Chd4-bound active
genes. Exchange of the histone variant H2A.z is
associated with regulation of transcription (20–23).
H2A.z was enriched at 97% of Chd4-bound pro-
moters in the mouse cerebellum (fig. S1J). Chd4
knockout decreased H2A.z and acetylated H2A.z
enrichment at promoters with high Chd4 occu-
pancy (Fig. 1, D and E), but not at most en-
hancers in the cerebellum (fig. S2).
We next intersected RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)
(13) and H2A.z chromatin immunoprecipita-
tion (ChIP)–Seq analyses in the mouse cerebel-
lum of conditional Chd4 knockout and control
littermate mice. Although a small group of 121
up-regulated genes in conditional Chd4 knockout
mice harbored increased H2A.z enrichment at
their promoters, a much larger group of 1233 up-
regulated genes displayed reduced H2A.z enrich-
ment at TSSs (Fig. 1F and fig. S3, A and B). Gene
ontology analyses revealed that genes with re-
duced H2A.z enrichment encoded proteins that
function in intracellular signaling cascades, cell
cycle control, and phosphorylation (fig. S3C). No-
tably, there was little or no change in H3K9/14ac,
H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 or in the density of
histone H3 at the promoters of these genes upon
Chd4 knockout (Fig. 1G and fig. S3, D to G). To-
gether, these data indicate that the NuRD complex
triggers the deposition of H2A.z at the promoters
of a large group of actively transcribed signaling
genes and inactivates their expression in the brain
in vivo.
The identification of an epigenetic link from
the NuRD complex to H2A.z at the promoters of
signaling genes led us to investigate whether the
NuRD complex regulates transcription dynam-
ically in response to neuronal activity. Expression
of the activity-dependent genes c-fos, nr4a1, dusp1,
and nfil3 was increased in granule neurons of the
rodent cerebellum upon membrane depolarization
and rapidly inactivated 1 hour after cessation of
membrane depolarization (Fig. 2A). Depletion
of Chd4 or Mbd3, another subunit of the NuRD
complex (24), impaired inactivation, but not re-
activation, of activity genes in neurons after
membrane depolarization (Fig. 2A and figs. S4
and S5, A and B). Thus, the NuRD complex ap-
pears to be required for inactivation of activity-
dependent genes in neurons.
In chromatin immunoprecipitation followed
by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-
qPCR) analyses, H2A.z increased at the promoters
of the c-fos, nr4a1, and dusp1 genes in granule
neurons during the inactivation phase after mem-
brane depolarization (fig. S5C). Depletion of Chd4
reduced H2A.z enrichment, but not histone H3,
at the promoters of the c-fos, nr4a1, and dusp1
genes in neurons during the inactivation phase
(Fig. 2B) but not the activation phase (fig. S5D).
Thus, the NuRD complex appears to specifically
stimulate the loading of H2A.z at the promoters
of activity-dependent genes during the inactiva-
tion phase of transcription.
Depletion of H2A.z by RNA interference (RNAi)
in neurons increased expression of the c-fos, nr4a1,
dusp1, and nfil3 genes during the inactivation
phase of activity-dependent transcription, with
little or no effect during activation or reactivation
(Fig. 2C and fig. S6). Thus, the NuRD complex and
H2A.z are required for inactivation of activity-
dependent gene expression in neurons.
We next used a rotarod procedure to induce
neuronal activity in the mouse cerebellum (Fig. 2D).
RNA-Seq analyses from the cerebellum of mice
running on a rotarod for 1 hour compared to mice
housed in a cage revealed increased transcription
of activity genes (Fig. 2E), and these genes were
inactivated within 1 hour after rotarod activity
stopped. Chd4 knockout increased the expression
of c-fos, fosl2, and dusp1 in the cerebellum after
cessation of rotarod activity but not during the
activation phase of rotarod-induced transcrip-
tion (Fig. 2F). Thus, the NuRD complex affects
specifically the inactivation of activity genes in
the brain.
We next tested whether NuRD-dependent in-
activation of activity genes might regulate granule
neuron connectivity in the cerebellum. We

 determined the stage of granule neuron matu-
ration in vivo during which the NuRD complex
regulates activity-dependent transcription. We
used in vivo electroporation and translating ribo-
somal affinity purification (25) to characterize
gene expression in developmentally synchronized
granule neurons in vivo (Sync-TRAP) (Fig. 3A and
fig. S7, A and B). Sync-TRAP followed by qPCR
or by RNA-Seq analyses of the cerebellum in
mice 6 days after electroporation revealed that
expression of granule neuron–specific genes was
enriched (fig. S7C), and led to the identification
of chromatin regulators and ubiquitin ligases
enriched in developing granule neurons (Fig.
3B and fig. S7D). Sync-TRAP-Seq analyses in
Chd4loxP/loxP mice electroporated with the re-
combinase Cre revealed that 86% of significantly
differentially expressed genes were up-regulated
upon conditional Chd4 knockout (Fig. 3C and
fig. S7E). Sync-TRAP-Seq and Sync-TRAP-qPCR
analyses revealed that transcription of the activity-
dependent npas4, nfil3, c-fos, and nr4a1 genes,
but not of granule neuron–specific genes, was
increased in granule neurons depleted of Chd4
in vivo (Fig. 3, D and E). Immunohistochemical
analyses confirmed that c-Fos protein was up-
regulated in Chd4-depleted granule neurons in
vivo (fig. S8, A and B). Sync-TRAP-qPCR analyses
also revealed that depletion of H2A.z increased
c-fos gene expression in granule neurons in vivo
(fig. S8C). The NuRD complex and H2A.z thus
appear to trigger the inactivation of activity-
dependent genes in synchronously developing gran-
ule neurons in the mouse cerebellum.
Because the NuRD/H2A.z epigenetic link reg-
ulates activity-dependent transcription in a tem-
poral window of dendrite morphogenesis in the
cerebellum, we asked whether NuRD-dependent
inactivation of genes might influence dendrite
patterning and connectivity. Granule neurons
labeled by in vivo electroporation undergo dis-
tinct stages of dendrite morphogenesis in a syn-
chronized manner in vivo (Fig. 4A and fig. S9, A
to C). Depletion of Chd4 increased the total
length of granule neuron dendrites and the
number of primary dendrites during the period
of pruning, with little or no effect on the de-
velopment of granule neuron dendrites during
earlier stages (Fig. 4B and fig. S9, A to C). Ex-
pression of NuRD-regulated activity genes also
impaired dendrite pruning in vivo (Fig. 4, C

 and D). In contrast, upon expression of NuRD-
repressed target genes not known to be regulated
by activity or other cerebellum-enriched tran-
scriptional regulators, only one increased den-
drite length but not dendrite number (Fig. 4, C
and D, and fig. S9D). These results indicate that
NuRD-dependent inactivation of activity genes
may drive granule neuron dendrite pruning in
the cerebellum.
We next characterized the consequences of
NuRD actions on responses of granule neurons
in behaving mice. Mature granule neurons receive
on average four mossy fiber inputs, which is op-
timal for sparse, lossless encoding of sensori-
motor information (26). We electroporated mouse
pups with a plasmid encoding the calcium in-
dicator GCaMP6s together with an mCherry
expression plasmid, and subjected mice to a
motorized treadmill task (Fig. 5A and movie S1).
After habituation, two-photon imaging of lobule
VI in the mouse cerebellum revealed that a set
of GCaMP6s-labeled granule neurons was active
during locomotion (Fig. 5, B and C). Conditional
Chd4 knockout triggered a robust increase in
the fraction of high-fidelity treadmill-responsive
granule neurons and concomitantly reduced
the fraction of unresponsive granule neurons

complex leads to hyperresponsivity of granule
neurons to sensorimotor stimuli.

granule neurons impaired procedural learning, in-
