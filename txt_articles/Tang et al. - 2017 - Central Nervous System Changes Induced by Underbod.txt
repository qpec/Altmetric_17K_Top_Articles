Abstract
Blast-related traumatic brain injury (bTBI) resulting from improvised explosive devices is the hallmark injury of recent
wars, and affects many returning veterans who experienced either direct or indirect exposure. Many of these veterans have
long-term neurocognitive symptoms. However, there is very little evidence to show whether blast-induced acceleration
alone, in the absence of secondary impacts, can cause mild TBI. In this study, we examine the effect of under-vehicle
blast-induced hyperacceleration (uBIH) of *1700 g on the biochemical and microstrucutral changes in the brain using
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Two groups of adult male Sprague–Dawley
(SD) rats were subjected to a sham procedure and uBIH, respectively. Axonal and neurochemical alterations were assessed
using in vivo DTI and MRS at 2 h, 24 h, and 7 days after uBIH. Significant reduction in mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity,
and radial diffusivity were observed in the hippocampus, thalamus, internal capsule, and corpus callosum as early as 2 h,
and sustained up to 7 days post-uBIH. Total creatine (Cr) and glutamine (Gln) were reduced in the internal capsule at 24 h
post-uBIH. The reductions in DTI parameters, Cr and Gln in vivo suggest potential activation of astrocytes and diffuse
axonal injury following a single underbody blast, confirming previous histology reports.

Introduction
A
ccumulating clinical evidence, as well as experience
from contemporary military operations, suggests that sub-
stantial short- and long-term neurological deficits can result from
blast exposure in the absence of a mechanical hit to the head. 1–5
Although the biological mechanisms underlying blast-induced
traumatic brain injury (bTBI) are not completely understood, in-
teraction with a fast-moving, transient pressure wave is generally
accepted as the primary cause of brain injury that results from blast
exposure.3,6–8 Over the last few decades, a number of experimental
blast models have been implemented to study the mechanisms of
blast overpressure impact in rodents and larger animals such as
sheep. 9–11 A common methodology is to use a shock tube where a
gas-driven pressure wave is delivered directly to the immobilized
animal’s head or body. Experimental studies in rodents have
demonstrated a correlation between memory dysfunction and dis-
tribution of neuropathological damage in the brain after exposure to
blast overpressure.12,13 However, in addition to blast overpres-
sure, a multitude of other physical forces may play a role in
bTBI, including thermal components and hyperacceleration.
Recently, we described the development of a new device14 that
can be used to induce underbody blast-induced hyperacceleration
(uBIH) in rodents. Our uBIH paradigm models what occurs to
occupants of vehicles targeted by land mines, rather than what
occurs when an explosion occurs in the vicinity of an unmounted
soldier. Using this device, we demonstrated that exposure of rats
to uBIH results in histopathological evidence of diffuse axonal
injury and potential astrocyte activation under conditions re-
sulting in an accelerative load of 50 g, indicating that hyper-
acceleration alone in the absence of significant blast pressure can
cause mild TBI. Whether these subtle changes are discernible
in vivo through advanced imaging has not been examined. The
ability to accurately diagnose changes in the brain in vivo can
have a profound impact on the appropriate therapeutic manage-
ment of the patient.

 Several advanced in vivo imaging techniques, including diffu-
sion tensor imaging (DTI) and proton magnetic resonance spec-
troscopy (MRS), have been explored to study TBI in pre-clinical
animal models, to better understand the temporal microstructural
and biochemical changes following TBI.15–21 Commonly used DTI
parameters include mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisot-
ropy (FA). MD measures the average water diffusion within the
brain tissue, whereas FA measures the degree of diffusion anisot-
ropy present within a voxel, as would be in the case of axons where
water diffuses preferentially along the axon. Alterations in MD
reflect pathological changes in the brain tissue caused by changes in
the diffusion characteristics of the intra- and extracellular water
compartments, including restricted diffusion (cytotoxic edema) and
water exchange across permeable boundaries.22 Changes in the FA,
on the other hand, are indicative of the structural integrity of the
tissue. The sub-parameters of FA include axial diffusivity (AD) and
radial diffusivity (RD). Diffusion along the axon is measured by
AD, and is a measure of axonal integrity, whereas RD measures
diffusion across the axon and is reflective of myelin integrity.23
Previous TBI studies on both humans and animals have shown
altered MD24–27 and FA in white matter regions 19,28–33 anywhere
from 24 h to several days following injury, reflecting pathological
conditions such as edema, fiber degeneration, cellular membrane
disruption, and cell death.20,32,34,35 High-resolution in vivo MRS
provides complementary information and assesses metabolic ir-
regularities following injury. Several metabolites such as N-
acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and lactate (Lac) are highly
sensitive to the pathology that contributes to TBI. Reduction in
concentration of NAA, glutamate (Glu), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol
(Ins), and taurine (Tau) in tissues and increased concentrations
of lactate, phosphocholine (PCho), and glutamine (Gln) at either
acute or subacute stages have been reported, indicating conditions
including ischemia, mitochondrial dysfunction, and imbalance of
excitatory/inhibitory and astrocyte activation.20,21,36,37 In this
study, we use both in vivo DTI and MRS to evaluate early micro-
structural and biochemical alterations caused by uBIH in the rat
brain.
Methods
Animal preparation
Six adult male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats weighing 300–350 g
underwent the uBIH procedure as described by Proctor and co-
workers,14 and another group of six male SD rats in the same weight
range were assigned to be the sham group.14 Briefly, all rats were
initially anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine
(10 mg/kg). Each of two rats belonging to the uBIH group was
wrapped in 2 cm thick cotton blankets to minimize movement, and
placed in the prone position in one of two aluminum cylinders,
37 cm long by 3 cm wide, which was bolted onto a 38 cm2 and 5 cm
thick aluminum platform. This platform was located immediately
above a second 38 cm2 aluminum platform that was 2.5 cm thick. A
0.6 cm thick hard rubber pad was placed between the two platforms
to dampen oscillatory accelerations. Both platforms had 2.5 cm
wide holes located inside each of the four corners. Aluminum rods
90 cm high were inserted through each of the holes and secured to a
steel base on which the platforms rested, thus allowing for only
direct movement of the platforms vertically following the blasts.
The steel base was bolted to the edges of a steel tank filled with
water to a standoff distance of from the bottom platform of 0.25 cm.
An explosive charge of 1.5 g pentaerythritol tetranitrate was placed
in the water 5 cm under the center of the plate, which when deto-
nated, generated maximal g forces of 1734 – 90g (mean – SEM;
n = 6) as measured by an accelerometer attached to the top plate
near the head ends of the cylinders. The explosion caused the plate
to accelerate vertically to heights of *70 cm and then drop back
down to the original location. During two experiments, we also
attached pressure sensors to the top plate near the accelerometer.
An increase of <1 psi was observed. Following the uBIH exposure,
the rats were removed from the assembly and allowed to recover
from the anesthesia. All animals recovered normal activity within
1 h and exhibited no signs of distress. Following the imaging
measurements performed on day 7 after sham or blast exposure, the
rats were euthanized.
In vivo DTI and 1H MRS
MR experiments were performed prior to the uBIH/sham pro-
cedure (baseline), 2 h, 24 h, and 7 days post-uBIH on a Bru-
kerBioSpec 7.0 Tesla 30 cm horizontal bore scanner (Bruker
Corporation, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a BGA12S gra-
dient system and interfaced to a BrukerParaVision 5.1 console. A
Bruker 72 mm linear-volume coil was used as the transmitter, and a
Bruker1H four channel surface coil array was used as the receiver.
The rat was under 2–3% isoflurane anesthesia and 1 L/min oxygen
administration during the MR experiment. An MR compatible
small-animal monitoring and gating system (SA Instruments, Inc.,
New York, NY) was used to monitor the animal’s respiration rate
and body temperature. The animal’s body temperature was main-
tained at 35–37�C using a warm water bath circulation. Ear pins and
bite bars were used to fix the animal’s head to minimize head
motion.
A three slice (axial, midsagittal, and coronal) scout image using
rapid acquisition with fast low angle shot (FLASH) 38,39 was used
to localize the rat brain. A fast shimming procedure (FASTMAP)
was used to improve the B0 homogeneity covering the brain.40 Both
proton density (PD) and T2-weighted images were obtained for
anatomic reference using a two-dimensional rapid acquisition with
relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence covering the entire
brain. 41 Imaging was performed over a 3.5 cm field of view (FOV)
in the coronal plane with an in-plane resolution of 137 lm using 24
slices at 1 mm thickness, at an effective echo time (TE) of 18.94 ms
for the PD-weighted images and an effective TE of 56.82 ms for the
T2-weighted images. The repeat time (TR) was 3500 ms.
Diffusion tensor images were acquired with a single shot, spin-
echo echo-planar imaging sequence. An encoding scheme of 30
gradient directions was used with the duration of each of the dif-
fusion gradients being 4 ms with a temporal spacing of 20 ms be-
tween the two diffusion gradients. Three b-values (1000 sec/mm2,
1500 sec/mm2, and 2000 sec/mm2) were acquired for each direction
following the acquisition of five images acquired at b = 0 sec/mm2.
The diffusion tensor images were obtained using a single average
over the same FOV as the coronal PD/T2 images, but at an in-plane
resolution of 0.273 mm at a TR/TE of 6000/49.90 ms respectively.
1H MRS data were obtained from voxels that covered the left
internal capsule (3·3·3mm3), left hippocampus (1.5·3.5·3mm3),
and left cortex (1.5·4·3mm3) respectively. These regions were
chosen because they were implicated in a previous study using the
same injury model and also based on reports using other TBI mod-
els.14,36 Prior to acquiring the spectra, adjustments of all first- and
second-order shims over the voxel of interest were accomplished with
the FASTMAP procedure. A custom modified short-echo-time Point-
RESolved Spectroscopy (PRESS) pulse sequence (TR/TE=2500/
10ms, number of averages=360)42 was used for MRS data acquisition
covering the three regions of interest (ROI). The unsuppressed water
signal from each of the prescribed voxels was obtained to serve as a
reference for determining the specific metabolite concentrations. The
total duration of the entire imaging experiment was *2.5h. All animal
procedures were approved by the University of Maryland, Baltimore,
Animal Care and Use Committee, and by the United States Army
Medical Research and Materiel Command Animal Care and Use
Review Office.

 Data processing and analysis
DTI reconstruction was performed on each voxel using in-house
MATLAB program (Mathworks, Natick, MA) to generate MD,
FA, AD, and RD maps. ROIs for each rat were manually drawn on
the FA map within the cortex (left, right), hippocampus (left, right),
thalamus (left, right), internal capsule (left, right), and corpus cal-
losum (genu, trunk, splenium), respectively, as shown in Figure 1A.
1H MRS data were fitted using the LCModel package.43 Re-
presentative in vivo high resolution1H MRS from the internal
capsule from one uBIH rat at its baseline is shown in Figure 1B. The
Cramer-Rao lower bounds were estimated by the LCModel to as-
sess the reliability of the reported metabolite concentration, and
only metabolites with standard deviations (SD) <20 were included
for further analysis.
DTI and MRS data from each region were normalized to its own
baseline level (pre-uBIH). The ratio of post to pre-uBIH level was
used to capture changes between the two time points. Statistical
analysis was performed using SigmaPlot version 12.5 (Systat
Software, Inc., San Jose, CA). Both DTI and MRS data of sham and
uBIH rats at four time points were analyzed using a two way re-
peated measures ANOVA to examine temporal changes in each
region, and group comparisons were made at each observation
point. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.
Results
Microstructural alterations after uBIH
Six rats were exposed to uBIH that generated maximal g forces
ranging from 1500 to 1900g, with a mean value of 1734 – 90g. All
of these rats and the six sham rats that were similarly anesthetized
but not subjected to uBIH survived to 7 days, at which time they
were euthanized. No animal demonstrated any visible changes on
T2-weighted brain images at 2 h, 24 h, and 7 days post-blast or post-
sham blast. However, broad reductions of DTI parameters were
observed in the hippocampus, thalamus, and internal capsule of rats
in the uBIH group compared with the sham group. Significant al-
terations of MD were observed in the hippocampus (right: F = 2.44,
p = 0.017), and the thalamus (left: F = 7.092, p = 0.024; right:
F = 5.257, p = 0.045) (Table 1) in the uBIH rats compared with the
sham group. The reductions of MD were significant at 2 h
( p = 0.044) and 7 days ( p = 0.025) in the hippocampus (Fig. 2A)
and at 24 h in the thalamus (left: p = 0.008; right: p = 0.018)
(Fig. 2B, C) in the uBIH cohort compared with the sham cohort. AD
was significantly reduced in the hippocampus (right: F = 7.208,
p = 0.023) (Table 1) at 24 h ( p = 0.006) and 7 days ( p = 0.008)
(Fig. 3A) and in the internal capsule (right: F = 5.222, p = 0.045) at
24 h ( p = 0.006) (Fig. 3B) in the uBIH group compared with the
sham group. RD was significantly reduced in the thalamus (left:
F = 14.291, p = 0.004; right: F = 7.861, p = 0.019) (Table 1) at 2 h
(left: p < 0.001; right: p = 0.001), 7 days (left: p = 0.013; right:
p = 0.041) (Fig. 4A,B) and in the genu of the corpus callosum
(F = 8.407, p = 0.016) at 2 h ( p = 0.031) and 7 days ( p = 0.004)
(Fig. 4C) after uBIH.
Biochemical alterations after uBIH
Biochemical alterations were observed in the internal capsule
where changes in the levels of Cr (F = 5.844, p = 0.036) were sub-
stantial, and marginal Gln (F = 3.877, p = 0.077) changes were
also observed in the uBIH group compared with the sham group
(Table 1). Both Cr ( p = 0.005) and Gln ( p = 0.021) levels were
significantly reduced at 24 h in the uBIH group compared with the
sham group (Fig. 5). No other significant biochemical alterations
were detected in any other regions at any time points in the uBIH
rats compared with the sham rats.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study to
apply a combination of DTI and MRS to detect biochemical and
microstructural changes following hyperacceleration from a blast
in isolation from the overpressure from the blast (primary impact)
or other secondary impact-related injuries. We demonstrate early
metabolic alterations and tissue microstructure following hyper-
acceleration, which persist until 7 days following the exposure. Our
study reveals three main findings: 1) no visible brain injuries were
observed on conventional T2-weighted imaging, even when the
animals were exposed to an average of 1700g; 2) Cr and Gln levels

 decreased in the internal capsule at 24 h post-uBIH, and returned to
baseline values by 7 days; and 3) shearing injuries as observed by
changes in diffusion tensor parameters were observed in the in-
ternal capsule corpus callosum, hippocampus, and thalamus as late
as 7 days following injury. When compared with the histological
findings from our previous study performed under conditions that
generated much lower g forces (50g), and that resulted in diffuse
axonal injury and astrocyte activation,14 the present study not only
confirms these findings, but also provides further evidence that
neuropathology changes can be detected in vivo using DTI and
MRS techniques.
In the present study, decreased AD level in the internal capsule at
24 h, decreased RD to the corpus callosum, and decreased MD and
AD levels in the hippocampus at both 2 h and 7 days post-uBIH are
indicative of mild diffuse axonal injuries, which agrees with the
histology findings using the same uBIH model.14 In addition to these
changes, we also observed a decreased MD at 24 h and decreased
RD at 2 h and 7 days post-uBIH in the thalamus, indicating cell
swelling. These results indicate that the sequelae of pathological
events occur at a different rate in each vulnerable brain, which is
well captured noninvasively from the longitudinal DTI data. The
low Cr and Gln levels found in the uBIH rats at 24 h in the internal
capsule may indicate an imbalance in astrocytic function after ex-
posure to uBIH. Synthesized in the liver and transported to the brain,

 it has been shown that Cr is two- to four-fold more concentrated in
glial cells than in neurons,44 with quite large regional variations.
Astroglial cells are virtually the sole site for Gln synthetase activity
in the brain to convert Glu to Gln.45 A prior study using this injury
model demonstrated astrocyte activation in the internal capsule at
7 days post-uBIH.14 It is, therefore, likely that the depletions of Cr
and Gln are related to this astrocyte activation. The in vivo longi-
tudinal localized MRS findings in this study provide further evi-
dence that gliosis in the internal capsule is a prominent pathology
following uBIH.14,36 Quantitative analyses of cellular inflammatory
responses, axonal injury, and behavorial alterations are in progress
to further characterize the pathophysiology of uBIH.
Various animal models have been developed to replicate dif-
ferent aspects of human TBI over the past several decades. The
most widely used ones are the controlled cortical impact (CCI)
model,46 the fluid percussion injury (FPI) model,47and blast tube
bTBI models.48,49 CCI and FPI models result in direct brain
deformation and neuronal cell death, which we have not detected
in the uBIH model (not shown). Depending on the severity of
injury, tissue damage from CCI and FPI is focal, and may be
directly visible even with conventional MRI. Studies have shown
that the changes from these focal injuries lead to various changes
in local conditions including ischemia, mitochondrial dys-
function, and imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory and astrocyte
activation.15,20,37,50
Studies using blast overpressure primary bTBI models are more
comparable to our uBIH model because they do not introduce direct
impact on the brain, and they result in relatively mild injuries
without severe tissue damage and broad biochemical disturbances.
In primary bTBI models, injury is generated by blast overpressure
waves or shock waves to the head, and often to the chest and
abdomen. Previous in vivo or in vitro primary bTBI studies using
shock tube or direct cranial blast reported increased mean kurtosis
(MK), Gln levels, and expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), indicating astrocyte and microglial activation in subcor-
tical regions such as the internal capsule, hippocampus, and hy-
pothalamus at the subacute stage following injury.36,51,52 Diffuse
axonal injury was also observed as increased FA in the inter-
nal capsule and decreased MD in the hippocampus up to 14 days
post-blast, indicating axonal swelling or a disruption of ionic
homeostasis resulting in an imbalance in intra- and extracellular
water.18,19,36 A more recent study assessed the value of manganese-
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) using manganese
chloride (MnCl2) at various time points following a 30 psig blast
in a shock tube, and found manganese uptake to be a promising
biomarker of TBI.53 Although future preclinical studies on hyper-
acceleration may benefit form MEMRI, the use of manganese in
humans has been shown to be neurotoxic, and the translation of such
studies may take some time, as research continues to make less toxic
manganese-based chelates.
The clinical relevance of results obtained using this small scale
underbody blast model depend to some degree on the scaling of
the g force and its relationship with the g forces experienced by
individuals present within vehicles targeted by land mines and
improvised explosive devices. The issue of scaling is important
but not straightforward. To our knowledge, there are no empirical
data from comparisons obtained with small or large animals ex-
posed to small- and large-scale explosions relevant to under-
vehicle blasts. The closest estimate is a scaling factor of 10, based
on buried explosions of different intensities.54 Experiments with
full scale models of military vehicles indicate that land mines
generate g force loads of between 200 and 4000g at floor level,55
which would be somewhat lower at the level of the passenger. If
indeed the g force scaling factor is close to 10, our explosions
generating 1700g would be equivalent to a full-scale under-
vehicle blast generating 170g, which is close to the measured
level of 200g load on full- scale vehicles generated by commonly
used explosives.
The present study demonstrates that in uBIH, the changes are
localized primarily to the internal capsule and the hippocampus,
with changes occurring at different time points, depending on the
parameter measured and the brain location. The results show some
consistency with previous primary bTBI reports. In a previous
study on a direct cranium only blast traumatic brain injury (dc-
bTBI) rat model that was silent on conventional T2-weighted im-
aging, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and proton MRSalso
demonstrated impairments in the internal capsule and the hippo-
campus, with peak changes observed at *21 days after dc-bTBI.36
Significant microglial activation and neurodegeneration were ob-
served even at 28 days in the hippocampus.

 It is generally accepted that TBI without physical signs of
brain injury can potentially contribute to post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD).5,56 The hippocampus and the internal capsule
are reported to play a role in triggering the typical symptoms of
PTSD.57–64 PTSD patients with a history of combat trauma show
a considerable reduction in the volume of the hippocampus, and
hippocampal dysfunction.58–60 Treatments that resulted in neu-
rogenesis in the hippocampus or increased hippocampal volume
were shown to improve PTSD symptoms.61,63,64 PTSD symp-
toms induced by mTBI are also associated with white matter
damage to the internal capsule and uncinate fasciculus, inducing
a loss of inhibitory control of the autonomic nervous system
(ANS), which results in alterations in ANS-driven defense and
socially adaptive physiological states.57 Significantly reduced
FA in the internal capsule was also reported to be closely related
to major depressive disorder (MDD) after mTBI.62 Although the
present study did not assess the long-term behavioral outcome
on the rats, given the spatial locations that are implicated in
this study and the dc-bTBImodel, the results suggest the possi-
bility of vestibular dysfunction and memory impairment.34 Our
findings also suggest that both the cranium-only blast injury
and the hyperacceleration-associated injury may combine syn-
ergistically, resulting in comorbidities that are worse than from a
single type of injury. This is a more likely scenario, in which a
person exposed to blast injury may also be exposed to a certain
amount of hyperacceleration.
This study on microstructural and biochemical alterations after
uBIH should be viewed in the context of certain limitations. First,
no studies were performed to assess the long-term behavioral
outcomes of these animals. Although we expect similar behavior
changes as in the dc-bTBI model, given the similarity in the regions
affected, future studies should include comprehensive behavioral
testing and correlate with in vivo findings. Second, histological
confirmation was not possible on these animals at this time.
However, histology results from the previous study using the same
uBIH model are supportive of the observed results in this study.12
Third, this study only used male rats, and, therefore, the results
cannot be generalized across the sexes. The effect of sex on the
outcomes and recovery of TBI has been emphasized in multiple
clinical and animal studies.65–68 Given the limitation of this pilot
study, future longitudinal studies should incorporate behavioral
testing of the animals and histological confirmation incorporating
both sexes.
Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that uBIH alone in
the absence of the blast overpressure component results in acute
mild TBI that continues to persist up to 7 days post-uBIH. These
findings offer useful information in understanding the pathophys-
iology of uBIH-induced mild TBI. uBIH induces diffuse axonal
injury and astrogliosis in the internal capsule and hippocampus.
Given that similar regions were implicated in dc-bTBI, it is likely
that the hyperacceleration along with the ensuing blast may syn-
ergistically lead to more comorbidities in the long term. The in-
ternal capsule and hippocampus may be potential therapeutic
targets for treating bTBI and preventing delayed mental health
problems.
