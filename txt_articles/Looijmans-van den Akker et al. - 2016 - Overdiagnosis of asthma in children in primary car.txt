 INTRODUCTION
Asthma is one of the most common chronic 
diseases in childhood and affects 5–10% 
of all children in the general population.1,2 
A study conducted in the US in an at-risk 
population showed an asthma incidence 
rate among children aged 5–11 years and 
12–17 years, respectively, of 11.1 and 4.4 
out of 1000 children per year.3 
International guidelines state that a 
combination of a suggestive medical 
history, physical examination, lung function 
tests, and additional tests will provide the 
information needed to ensure a correct 
diagnosis of asthma.2,4–6 Until the age of 
6 years, asthma is a symptom diagnosis, 
because pulmonary function tests cannot 
be performed in children under this age. 
Assessment of lung function is regarded 
as essential for the diagnosis and therefore 
advised in all asthma guidelines to ensure 
a correct diagnosis, because signs and 
symptoms alone are insufficient.7 A 
study in the US found that 75% of family 
physicians perform spirometry on children. 
Surprisingly, only 36% of them indicate 
routine use to establish an asthma 
diagnosis as recommended by national 
guidelines.8 
In the Netherlands lung function tests on 
children are not often performed because 
patients have to be referred to a hospital 
for the tests. This causes an extra barrier 
for GPs to complete a diagnosis of asthma. 
This is believed to lead to inaccuracy when 
detecting asthma in primary care in daily 
practice, leading to overdiagnosis of the 
condition. 
Previous studies have indicated that 
asthma is overdiagnosed in children. 
However, the scale of this overdiagnosis 
has not been quantified.9–11 Overdiagnosis 
gives 
rise 
to 
overprescription 
and 
incorrect use of medication, and to anxiety 
in parents and children. Therefore, the 
aim of this study was to assess whether 
the diagnosis of asthma and/or asthma 
treatment in children is preceded by the 
correct diagnostic process for asthma as 
recommended in international guidelines.
METHOD
Study population
Data were extracted from the medical files 
of children enlisted in the four academic 
primary healthcare centres in Utrecht, 
which are linked to the University Medical 
Center Utrecht. When data in the electronic 
medical files were incomplete, data were 
instead extracted from the paper medical 
records from health centres where patients 
were enlisted previously. Data on medication 
were obtained from the four pharmacies 
associated with the participating healthcare 
centres.
Patients were included who were aged 
6–18 years on 15 April 2013 and who had 
received a diagnosis of asthma or were 
treated as having asthma with chronic 
inhalation 
medication. 
The 
asthma 
diagnosis was considered established when

Overdiagnosis of asthma in children 
in primary care:
a retrospective analysis

Abstract
Background 
Asthma is one of the most common chronic 
diseases in childhood. According to guidelines, 
a diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed 
using lung function testing in children aged 
>6 years. Previous studies indicate that asthma 
in children is probably overdiagnosed. However, 
the extent has not previously been assessed.
Aim
To assess the extent and characteristics of 
confirmed and unconfirmed diagnoses of 
asthma in children who were diagnosed by 
their GP as having asthma or who were treated 
as having asthma.
Design and setting
Retrospective analysis in four academic 
primary healthcare centres in Utrecht, the 
Netherlands.
Method
Routine care registration data of children 
aged 6–18 years who received a diagnosis of 
asthma or were treated as having asthma were 
analysed.
Results
In only 16.1% (n = 105) of the children 
diagnosed with asthma was the diagnosis 
confirmed with spirometry, whereas in 23.2% 
(n = 151) the signs and symptoms did give rise 
to suspected asthma but the children should 
have undergone further lung function tests. In 
more one-half (53.5%, n = 349) of the children 
the signs and symptoms made asthma unlikely 
and thus they were most likely overdiagnosed. 
The remaining 7.2% (n = 47) were probably 
correctly classified as not having asthma. The 
main reasons for classifying asthma without 
children undergoing further lung function tests 
were dyspnoea (31.9%, n = 174), cough (26.0%, 
n = 142), and wheezing (10.4%, n = 57).
Conclusion
Overdiagnosis of childhood asthma is common 
in primary care, leading to unnecessary 
treatment, disease burden, and impact 
on quality of life. However, only in a small 
percentage of children is a diagnosis of asthma 
confirmed by lung function tests.

 Care (ICPC) code for asthma (ICPC R96) was 
applied. A child was defined as using chronic 
inhalation medication when the prescription 
was filled by the pharmacy at least three 
times in the last 3 years. Note that one 
prescription contains enough medication to 
last for 3–6 months. Therefore children who 
are only in need of inhalation medication 
during the winter months would have 
sufficient medication with one prescription. 
Data collection
The following data were collected from 
the medical files of each patient: age, sex, 
presence of the diagnosis asthma (ICPC 
R96), year in which diagnosis was given, 
whether the diagnosis was established 
according to the guidelines, number of 
episodes referred to by a GP as asthma 
exacerbation in 2012, use of chronic 
inhalation medication, type of medication, 
and the number of inhalation medication 
prescriptions in 2012. 
Asthma diagnosis
Confirmed asthma. Asthma diagnosis 
was benchmarked by comparison with 
international guidelines.2,4–6 The asthma 
diagnosis for children aged >6 years was 
considered confirmed in case of recurrent 
dyspnoea or wheezing, with reversible 
bronchial obstruction confirmed with 
spirometry and, when needed, additional 
tests, such as a histamine challenge test, 
carried out by a pulmonary specialist. 
Probable asthma. Children with a high 
probability of asthma based on a suggestive 
medical history and physical examination 
during an exacerbation, but without 
further lung function tests, are considered 
to probably have asthma. Furthermore, 
children who use chronic inhalation 
medication and do not have an asthma 
exacerbation could have properly regulated 
asthma. Therefore children who are in need 
of chronic inhalation corticosteroids or 
who need beta-2 sympathomimetic drugs 
from the pharmacy at least three times a 
year were considered as having probable 
asthma.
Unlikely asthma. Children who did not 
have an exacerbation and used no or very 
little inhalation medication, no inhalation 
corticosteroid, and a maximum of two beta-
2 sympathomimetic inhalers yearly were 
considered as unlikely to have asthma.
No asthma. Asthma was ruled out by a 
pulmonary specialist based on medical 
examination, physical examination, lung 
function tests, and a histamine provocation 
test. 
Overdiagnosis. Children were classified as 
having an overdiagnosis if they were given 
the diagnosis asthma (ICPC R96) and fall in 
the ‘unlikely asthma’ or ‘no asthma’ group. 
Symptom diagnosis asthma. Children aged 
<6 years, who cannot perform a spirometry, 
are given a symptom diagnosis. This 
symptom diagnosis should be reviewed 
when a child turns 6 years old. When this 
is not reviewed, a child will not be correctly 
diagnosed with asthma according to the 
guidelines. 
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using 
SPSS for Windows (version 20). For 
descriptive statistics, frequency tables and 
mean ± standard deviation were used.
RESULTS
Study population
There were 4960 children aged 6–18 years 
enlisted in the four participating academic 
primary health care centres in Utrecht. Of 
these, 546 had the ICPC code for asthma. 
Another 106 children were included based 
on their use of chronic inhalation medication 
without the ICPC code for asthma, to give a 
total of 652 children. General characteristics 
of the children enrolled are given in Table 
1. The mean age of children was 10.7 years 
(range 6–17 years). The asthma diagnosis 
(ICPC R96) was given in 83.7% of cases 
(n = 546). A total of 47.2% (n = 308) of these 
children used chronic inhalation medication. 
The mean number of exacerbations of the 
study population was 0.2 (standard deviation 
± 0.4) in 2012.
Overdiagnosis
Of all 652 children who received the 
diagnosis asthma (ICPC R96) or were 
treated as having asthma, only 105 children 
How this fits in
Previous studies have indicated 
that asthma in children is probably 
overdiagnosed. The extent to which this 
occurs has not previously been assessed. 
This study is the first to investigate 
whether an asthma diagnosis and/or 
treatment given to children is preceded 
by a diagnostic process as recommended 
in the guidelines. It shows the need to 
follow the correct diagnostic strategy when 
diagnosing asthma in children.
British Journal of General Practice, March 2016  e153
 (16.1%) had an asthma diagnosis that was 
confirmed by spirometry. 
There were 151 children (23.2%) with 
probable asthma who should undergo 
further lung function testing to meet the 
criteria for a confirmed asthma diagnosis. 
A total of 349 (53.5%) of the children were 
overdiagnosed. Five children had no 
asthma, and 344 children were unlikely to 
have asthma. The remaining 47 children 
(7.2%) probably had no asthma, and were 
correctly not given the ICPC code R96 
(Figures 1 and 2). 
Diagnostic criteria for the asthma 
diagnosis (ICPC R96)
Of the 110 children with the diagnosis 
asthma (ICPC R96) who underwent lung 
function testing to confirm (reversible) 
bronchus obstruction, the diagnosis was 
confirmed in 105 cases (19.2%). In five 
children (0.9%) further lung function testing 
showed that they did not have asthma. 
However, the diagnosis asthma (ICPC R96) 
was incorrectly maintained. 
In children who were given the diagnosis 
asthma without spirometry, a variety of 
diagnostic tests, anamnestic clues, and 
abnormalities in physical examination 
were probably the basis for receiving the 
diagnosis asthma (ICPC R96). Dyspnoea 
was the most frequent symptom (n = 174; 
31.9%), followed by cough (n = 142; 26.0%), 
and wheezing (n = 57; 10.4%). In 36 cases 
(6.6%) the child was aged <6 years when 
last seen for a respiratory tract infection 
and met the criteria for a symptom 
diagnosis. For nine children (1.6%) having 
a prolonged exhalation during auscultation 
was the main criterion that was used for the 
diagnosis asthma. Peak flow measurement 
was the basis for the diagnosis for 10 (1.8%) 
children, whereas for eight children (1.5%) 
it was an allergy test (Figure 3).
Incidence of asthma
Incidence of the diagnosis asthma 
(ICPC R96) was 5.4 per 1000 children 
aged 6–18 years. Incidence was worked 
out by calculating the number of newly 
assigned ICPC codes in 2012 for children 
aged 6–18 years compared with the total 
number of children aged 6–18 years old on 
a reference date in 2012.

 Chronic inhalation medication use and 
exacerbation
Children without an asthma diagnosis 
(column C in Figure 4) who did use 
chronic 
inhalation 
medication 
used 
primarily a beta-2 sympathomimetic and 
79.2% (n = 84) filled in their prescriptions 
up to two times a year. Almost all these 
children had no exacerbations (98.8%, 
n = 83). This in contrast to the children 
who underwent further lung function tests: 
most (73.3%, n = 77) used a combination of 
an inhalation corticosteroid and a beta-2 
sympathomimetic (column D in Figure 4), 
and 53.6% (n = 56) filled their prescription 
up to two times a year. Approximately one-
third (34.3%, n = 36) of these children had 
one or more exacerbations a year.
DISCUSSION
Summary 
In this study, overdiagnosis of asthma was 
found in more than half of the children, 
leading to unnecessary treatment, disease 
burden, and impact on their quality of life. 
Only in a few children was the diagnosis 
of asthma confirmed using lung function 
tests, despite this being recommended in 
international guidelines. 
Strengths and limitations
This study is the first to investigate whether 
an asthma diagnosis and/or treatment given 
to children is preceded by a diagnostic 
process as recommended in the guidelines. 
There are certain potential limitations to 
be considered in order to interpret the 
findings in this study correctly. The group of 
children selected for this study are patients 
enlisted in the four academic primary 
healthcare centres in a newly developed 
large residential area in Leidsche Rijn, part 
of the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands. The 
average age in this area is slightly younger 
than the overall Dutch population (32.1 years 
compared with 41.0 years). However, there 
are no reasons to assume that the children 
in this area have different characteristics 
from the average Dutch population in this 
age band. Furthermore, the incidence of 
the diagnosis asthma found in this study is 
comparable to that found in a previous US 
study.3
Different diagnostic behaviour and 
compliance with guidelines in these 
academic practices could have led to an 
underestimation of incorrect diagnosis in 
the average Dutch primary care setting. 
Normal spirometry alone does not exclude 
asthma diagnosis. However, these children 
were reviewed by a pulmonary specialist 
who carried out additional tests when 
needed.
Medication use was established by 
cooperation of the four pharmacies 
associated with the participating healthcare 
centres. It is possible that some children 
had a different pharmacy from the one 
associated with the healthcare centres. 
However, this will only be the case in a very 
small minority because the pharmacies are 
in the direct vicinity of the health centres 
and there is a direct link between patients’ 
files in the healthcare centres and these 
local pharmacies. 
Because children who are in need of 
chronic inhalation corticosteroids or who 
require beta-2 sympathomimetic drugs 
from the pharmacy at least three times 
a year were considered as children with 
probable asthma, overtreatment could 
have been underestimated.
Comparison with existing literature
Other studies have suggested overdiagnosis 
based on questionnaires filled in by 
parents.10,11 However, to the authors’ 
knowledge this is the first study to 
investigate whether an asthma diagnosis 
and/or treatment given to children was 
preceded by a correct diagnostic process 
based on data from medical files.
The fact that in this study lung function 
tests in the initial assessment were only 
used in a few children is consistent with 
previous reports of widespread underuse of 
spirometry in paediatric asthma.12 
Implications for practice
To avoid overtreatment, medicalisation, 
and anxiety in parents, a more structured 
diagnostic strategy including lung function 
testing in children under suspicion of having 
asthma is warranted. Empirical diagnosis 
of asthma should be avoided and symptom 
diagnosis is a better option until asthma 
is established based on symptoms and 
lung function tests. Lung function tests for 
children are still underused in primary care. 
However, to increase their use, steps are 
currently being taken to educate primary 
care personnel to perform these tests in 
children. In addition, access to lung function 
tests for children in hospitals should 
perhaps also be improved.
