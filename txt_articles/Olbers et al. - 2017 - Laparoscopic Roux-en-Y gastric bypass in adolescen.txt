 Abstract
Background—Severe obesity in adolescence is associated with reduced life expectancy and 
impaired quality of life. Long-term benefits of conservative treatments in adolescents are limited, 
while short-term outcomes of adolescent bariatric surgery are promising. This study aimed to 
report 5-year outcomes following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in adolescents, compared 
with conservatively treated adolescents and adults undergoing RYGB.
Methods—A nationwide prospective non-randomised controlled study of adolescents (13–18 
years) with severe obesity undergoing RYGB, a matched adolescent control group undergoing 
conservative treatment, and an adult comparison group undergoing RYGB. The primary outcome 
measure was change in weight over 5 years. Multilevel mixed-effect regression models were used 
to assess longitudinal changes. Healthcare usage was analysed with linear regression together with 
nonparametric bootstrapping.
Findings—Eighty-one adolescents with baseline age 16·5 years (SD 1·2), weight 132·8 kg (SD 
22·1) and body mass index (BMI) 45·5 kg/m2 (SD 6·1) underwent RYGB. Five-year weight 
change was −36·8 kg (95% CI −40·9 to −32·8) resulting in a BMI reduction of 13·1 kg/m2, 
although weight loss <10% occurred in 11%.
Comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors resolved in 74–100%: type 2 diabetes (3/3), 
disturbed glucose homeostasis (18/21), dyslipidaemia (43/52), elevated blood pressure (11/12), 
inflammation (hs-CRP ≥ 2 mg/L; 45/61) and elevated liver enzymes (19/19), each comparing 
favourably with adolescent controls at 5 years.
Functional (SF-36) and obesity-specific (OP-14) quality of life improved in the adolescent RYGB 
group (mean difference 4·2, p=0·006 and −9·9 p=0·009). Twenty RYGB participants (25%) 
underwent additional abdominal surgery for complications of surgery or rapid weight loss, 72% 
demonstrated some nutritional deficiency, and healthcare consumption increased. Mean BMI 
increased in control adolescents (3·3 kg/m2, 95% CI 1·9 to 4·8), while BMI change in adults was 
similar to surgical adolescents (mean difference 0·8 kg/m2, 95% CI −1·1 to 2·8). Twenty 
adolescent controls (25%) underwent bariatric surgery within 5 years.
Interpretation—Adolescents with severe obesity undergoing RYGB experienced substantial 
weight loss over 5 years, alongside improvements in comorbidities, risk factors and quality of life. 
Surgical intervention was, however, associated with additional surgical interventions and 
nutritional deficiencies. Non-surgical treatment was associated with weight gain and 25% 
underwent bariatric surgery within 5 years.

Introduction
Severe obesity in adolescence is a life-threatening and life-shortening disease,1,2 leading to a 
multitude of other diseases.3,4 As the mean age of obesity onset has decreased,5 the onset of 
related diseases, most notably type 2 diabetes (T2DM), has shifted increasingly toward 
childhood.6 T2DM is markedly more aggressive when occurring in childhood,6 and obesity

 increases cardiovascular risk factors in childhood,7 leading to a poor prognosis in this 
group,8,9 with few effective therapeutic options available.10
The prevalence of adolescent obesity has now reached between 5% and 10% among 
developed countries.5,11,12 Non-surgical programmes remain the cornerstone of treatment of 
adolescents with severe obesity, although their effect is limited and insufficient for long-term 
reduction of obesity-related health hazards.13 However, surgery is increasingly being 
recommended14 and performed,15 and robust outcomes have been reported up to three years 
after surgery.16–18
This study reports outcomes over 5 years in adolescents following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
(RYGB) or conservative treatment in a Swedish nationwide prospective non-randomised 
controlled study, with an additional matched adult comparison group undergoing RYGB.
Materials and methods
Study design
The Adolescent Morbid Obesity Surgery (AMOS) study is a Swedish nationwide 
prospective, non-randomised controlled study.17 The study was conducted according to the 
Declaration of Helsinki with the approval of the Gothenburg regional ethics committee 
(523–04).
Participants
1. Adolescents treated with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)—All eligible 
adolescents presenting with severe obesity to three specialised paediatric obesity treatment 
units were offered assessment for surgery upon fulfilling inclusion criteria. This represented 
100 patients, of whom 19 declined surgery and the remaining 81 adolescents ultimately 
underwent RYGB. Eligibility criteria were: age 13–18 years, BMI ≥ 40, or ≥35 kg/m2 with 
comorbidity (e.g. T2DM, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome), pubertal Tanner stage >III, 
height growth velocity beyond peak, and at least 1 year in a formal, conventional weight loss 
programme. Major exclusion criteria included severe psychiatric disorder, ongoing drug 
abuse, obesity secondary to brain injury, and syndromic or monogenic obesity (the 
melanocortin 4 receptor was sequenced in >50% of patients based upon clinical suspicion). 
Recruitment occurred between 2006 and 2009 (Fig. S1).17
2. Adolescents receiving conventional treatment—A matched conservatively 
treated adolescent control group was identified from the Swedish Childhood Obesity 
Treatment Register (BORIS13), ensuring the date of surgery was within 1 month of baseline 
weight for the corresponding control patient. Sequential matching of individuals ensured that 
the mean values of matching variables (baseline BMI, age and sex) in the control group 
moved closer to the mean values within the surgical group as much as was possible with 
each additional control patient. This registry did not include detailed formal data regarding 
individuals’ compliance with conventional treatment.

 3. Adults treated with gastric bypass—Adults aged 35–45 years with severe obesity 
(adult group) undergoing RYGB were matched by BMI and sex to adolescents undergoing 
surgery, and the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as adolescents were used.17
Treatments
The laparoscopic RYGB incorporated an ante-colic, ante-gastric Roux-en-Y construction 
with a linearly stapled gastro-jejunostomy,19 without closure of mesenteric windows. All 
adolescent and adult operations were performed at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 
Gothenburg, by either of two experienced adult bariatric surgeons, assisted by a paediatric 
surgeon. Surgical treatment of adults was delivered by the same team in an identical setting 
in order to maximise comparability. The control group underwent individualised treatment 
according to Swedish standards.17 Within the pragmatic study design, conventional 
treatment was non-standardised, but was delivered as an individualised treatment by the 
multidisciplinary team (MDT) and focused on behaviour change.13,20,21
Clinical measurements
The primary outcome was change in weight across 5 years. Secondary outcomes included 
detailed anthropometry, biochemistry, quality of life evaluation and clinical outcomes.17
The term disturbed glucose homeostasis was adopted in response to incomplete data 
regarding fasting plasma glucose, and was defined by adding a fasting capillary glucose 
criterion, i.e. ≥6·1 mmol/L but <7·0 mmol/L (≥100 but <110 mg/dL), to the American 
Diabetes Association (ADA) definition of impaired fasting glucose, or prediabetes,22 i.e. the 
absence of medication use for DM with fasting plasma glucose ≥5·5 mmol/L but <7 mmol/L 
(≥100 mg/dL but <126 mg/dL), or HbA1c of ≥39 mmol/mol (≥5·7%) but <45 mmol/mol 
(<6·5%). T2DM and its remission were also diagnosed according to ADA definitions, 
remission determined using the criteria FBG <7·0 mmol/L (<126 mg/dL), HbA1C <45 
mmol/mol (<6·5%), fasting capillary glucose <6·1 mmol/L (<110 mg/dL) in the absence of 
diabetes medication.22 All other definitions and remission criteria are provided in the web 
additional material.
Follow-up
Adolescent surgical patients were assessed before surgery and postoperatively at 2 and 6 
months, 1, 2 and 5 years. Body weight, height, blood pressure, biochemical analyses and 
quality of life assessment were performed preoperatively and at 1, 2 and 5 years after 
surgery. Information regarding use of drugs or alcohol was sought from participants and 
caregivers at recruitment. Surgical adolescents were prescribed a daily multivitamin and 
mineral supplement (including 200 micrograms of folic acid), as well as additional vitamin 
B12 (cobalamin 1 mg /day), and calcium carbonate/ vitamin D (1 g/ 800 IU /day) tablets. 
Females also received iron (Fe2+ 100 mg /day) supplementation.
In the adolescent control group, weight and height were measured and registered at baseline 
and after 1, 2 and 5 years. At 5 years the control group was invited to a study visit for 
biochemistry and quality of life data collection.

 Between years 2 and 5, adolescents were predominantly followed up in the community. In 
accordance with Swedish convention, systematic medical treatment for cardiovascular risk 
factors in youth, such as dyslipidaemia or hypertension, was not common practice.
In the adult group, weight and height were measured and registered prospectively at 
inclusion and 1 year postoperatively. Two- and 5-year weight data were drawn from 
community healthcare centre measurements, where available, and self-reported 
measurements otherwise.
Blood sampling and handling have been described in detail previously.17
Health-related quality of life
A Swedish version of Short Form-36 Health Survey v2 (SF-36), validated for use in 
adolescents, was used to measure health-related quality of life.23 The Obesity-related 
Problems scale (OP-14) was used to assess psychosocial problems related to weight and 
body shape.24
Adverse events
Thirty-day surgical complications data in the surgical group were assessed at the 2-month 
follow-up visit and thereafter prospectively recorded in the electronic case record file. A 
complementary retrospective survey of medical records was conducted to capture missing 
data up to 5-year follow-up. In addition, data on inpatient care (admissions and hospital 
days) and hospital-based outpatient care visits were retrieved from the nationwide National 
Patient Register, and prescription drug costs from the Prescribed Drug Register.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics are given as means with standard deviations (SD). Multilevel mixed-
effect regression models were fitted to the data to assess longitudinal changes. In the 
analyses, observations were considered nested within persons, and standard errors were 
calculated by taking into account the repeated measurements. Changes over time are 
expressed with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The underlying assumptions for the mixed-
models were evaluated through analyses of the residuals.
Among control crossovers the last observation was carried forward for anthropometric data 
and crossovers were excluded from analysis for all other variables. Sex- and age-adjusted 
mean differences for 5-year accumulated hospital days, visits for outpatient care, and 
prescription drug costs were estimated using linear regression with 95% CIs generated by 
nonparametric bootstrapping not requiring additional assumptions.
All p-values are two-tailed and p<0·05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical 
analyses were carried out using the Stata statistical package 12·1 (Stata-Corp. 2011, Stata 
Statistical Software: Release 12, College Station, TX, USA; StataCorp LP).
Role of the funding source
Funders of the study did not contribute to the study design, the collection, analysis or 
interpretation of data, or manuscript writing.

 Results
Baseline characteristics
Baseline details are given in Table 1 and Table 2. At inclusion, participants in the surgical 
group were older and had significantly higher BMI than the control group. The proportion of 
males was 44% in the control group and 35% in both surgical groups (non-significant). 
Mean age in the adult group was 39·7 years.
Psychosocial impairment, such as depressive or anxiety disorder, was common in the 
surgical group and a neuropsychiatric diagnosis was present in 31% of subjects (specific 
diagnoses unavailable). Sixteen percent had previously demonstrated self-destructive 
behaviour. Forty-one percent had previously been treated in a paediatric psychiatry 
outpatient department.
Follow-up rates
The follow-up rate was 100% in the surgical group, 90% (72/80) in the control group and 
88% (71/81) in the adult group at 5 years. The follow up rate of our cohorts in national 
health care registries was 100%.
Weight outcomes
Anthropometric changes are given in Table 1 and Table 2. Mean BMI change across 5 years 
was −13·1 kg/m2 (95% CI −14·5 to −11·8) in the surgical group, +3·3 kg/m2 (95% CI +1·1 
to +4·8) in the control group, and −12·3 kg/m2 (95% CI −13·7 to −10·9) in the adult group. 
The proportion of participants reaching a BMI <35 kg/m2was 72% (surgical), 7% (control), 
and 76% (adult) respectively. Thirty-seven percent of surgical group patients no longer had 
obesity (BMI<30), 3% in the control group, and 40% in the adult group. The majority of 
adolescent and adult surgical group patients achieved ≥20% total body weight loss (69% and 
85% respectively), while a majority (69%) of control patients gained weight (Fig. 1b). 
Suboptimal weight loss was more common among adolescents than adults (p=0·035, Fig. 
1b). Mean weight-regain between a nadir, observed at 2 years, and follow-up at 5 years, was 
similar in the operated adolescents and adults (Fig. 1a).
Twenty patients (25%) in the control group underwent bariatric surgery between follow-up 
years 2 and 5, having reached adult eligibility. This group had a median weight gain of 19·6 
kg (range −1·1 to 53·5) from baseline until undergoing surgery, compared to a 7·3 kg (range 
−26·8 to 60·4) increase in control adolescents not undergoing surgery over 5 years.
Cardiometabolic risk factors
Longitudinal metabolic changes are reported for the surgical group alongside 5-year cross-
sectional values for control participants in Table 2 and Table S1 (web additional material).
Glucose homeostasis
All measures of glucose homeostasis improved across 5 years (Table 2). At baseline, three 
patients (4%) had TD2M, all of whom were in remission 5 years after surgery. A disturbed 
glucose homeostasis was observed at baseline in 22 individuals (27%), which normalised in

 18 patients (86%), although two new cases occurred after 5 years, resulting in a total of six 
cases (8%) at 5 years after surgery (Table 3). Fasting plasma insulin levels decreased 
markedly from 216·7 to 65·0 pmol/L (Table 2). Meanwhile, in the control group, the 
prevalence of disturbed glucose homeostasis was 16% at 5 years, and one new case of 
T2DM was observed (Table 3).
Lipids
There were 56 cases (69%) of dyslipidaemia at baseline, decreasing to 11/76 (15%) at 5 
years. Notably, all cases of elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or triglycerides resolved 
across 5 years (Table 3). The 5-year prevalence of dyslipidaemia in the control group was 
73% (Table 3).
Blood pressure
Blood pressure was elevated in 12/78 (15%) participants at baseline and normalised in all 12 
at 5 years, although two incident cases led to a prevalence of 3% (Table 3). The 5-year 
prevalence in the control group was 10% (Table 3).
Inflammation
Elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; ≥2 mg/L) was present in 87% (65/75) 
participants at baseline, reducing to 25% (19/77) across 5 years. In the control group hsCRP 
was elevated in 82% (32/39) at 5 years (Table 3).
Liver function
Elevated alanine transaminase levels were present in 25/81 (31%) surgical patients at 
baseline, normalising in 92% of cases (23/25) at 5-year follow-up, although there were two 
incident cases (Table 3). Elevated aspartamine transaminase levels, observed in 9/80 (11%), 
normalised in all cases across 5 years (Table 3). Alkaline phosphatase is included in Table 
S1 and Table S2 (web additional material).
Vitamins, minerals and general nutritional markers
At 5 years, 63% (46/73) in the surgical group and 57% in the control group (20/35) had 
vitamin D (25-OH D) insufficiency (<50 nmol/l; p=0.674; Table S2).
Low ferritin and/or iron levels, present in 24% (18/76) of the surgery participants at baseline, 
increased to 66% (51/77), compared with 29% (12/42) in the control group at 5 years (Table 
S2). One of 74 surgical participants (1%) had a low vitamin B12 level at baseline, increasing 
to 16/73 individuals (22%) at 5 years, when the prevalence was 6% (2/31) in the control 
group (Table S2).
The prevalence of anaemia (haemoglobin in females <120 g/dL; males <130 g/dL) in the 
surgical group rose from 10% (8/78) to 32% (25/77) across 5 years, while in the control 
group it was 7% (3/42) at 5 years (Table 3).

 Quality of life
At 5-year follow-up, significant improvements were observed among adolescent surgical 
patients in the physical component summary score (Table S3) and in 3 of the 8 SF-36 health 
domains (Fig. 2, Table S3): physical functioning (mean change 13·5, 95% CI 8·1 to 19·0), 
physical role functioning (mean change 11·2, 95% CI 4·0 to 18·3) and general health 
perceptions (mean change 12·4, 95% CI 6·5 to 18·3), all of which are within the physical 
domain (Fig. 2). Physical role functioning was also significantly better among surgical group 
patients than controls (mean difference 13·5, 95% CI 2·2 to 24·8; Table S3). Weight-related 
psychosocial problems improved significantly across follow-up (mean difference −13·0, 
95% CI −19·6 to −6·4).
Adverse events
Across 5 years, 20 patients (25%) in the surgical group underwent 21 additional abdominal 
surgical interventions, excluding plastic surgery (Table 4). Eleven procedures were for acute 
intestinal obstruction and nine for symptomatic gallstones. No deaths occurred across 5 
years of follow-up. Some patients and their caregivers withheld information about substance 
misuse, even before surgery. We could not obtain valid data regarding adverse events and 
reoperation rates in the adult comparison group.
Healthcare use and medication
Over 5 years of follow-up and including the index hospitalisation, the surgical group 
accumulated a mean 16·1 hospital days, compared to 2·8 in the control group (mean 
difference 13·0, 95% CI 7·4 to 18·6). In-hospital days related to admissions for surgical 
procedures, including the index surgery, accounted for 6·5 days in the surgery group 
compared to 1·6 days in the control group (mean difference 5·0, 95% CI 2·7 to 7·2).
The number of outpatient visits was also higher in the surgical than the control group (14·6 
vs. 10·0; mean difference 4·9, 95% CI 1·3 to 8·4).
Total prescription drug costs over 5 years were similar in the surgical and control groups 
($2317 vs. $2701; mean difference −$611, 95% CI −3252 to 2030).
Discussion
Most adolescents undergoing RYGB for severe obesity in this study experienced substantial 
weight loss, metabolic improvement, reduction of the chronic inflammatory state and 
enhancement of quality of life, which remained 5 years after surgery. Concurrently, a control 
group undergoing conventional treatment experienced progressive weight gain.
RYGB resulted in a mean 29% weight loss after 5 years, which is comparable to the 28% 
reduction after three years reported in the Teen-LABS study.16 Rapid weight reduction 
during the first year was followed by modest weight regain between 2 and 5 years. The 
matched adult group, operated at the same centre, experienced a similar mean weight 
reduction. However, a greater variability in long-term weight outcome in adolescents, 
compared with adults, may indicate greater phenotypical heterogeneity and/or a greater need 
for postoperative support to optimise outcomes.

 We and others have previously reported that metabolic risk factors and comorbid conditions 
improve markedly in adolescents 2 to 3 years after surgery.16–18 In this study we confirm 
that these positive trends remain after 5 years. We observed an amelioration of disturbed 
glucose homeostasis, dyslipidaemia and high blood pressure. We also found a substantial 
reduction in hsCRP following surgery, suggesting improvement of the chronic inflammatory 
state, which has been demonstrated to be a contributor to cardiovascular comorbidity 
development.25,26 At 5 years, metabolic risk factors, such as dyslipidaemia and elevated 
liver enzymes, were more prevalent in the control group than the surgical group, although 
direct comparison between the two adolescent groups was influenced by the crossover of 
participants to undergo RYGB during follow-up. Since individuals with the most severe 
weight gain underwent surgery during follow-up, the control group became progressively 
“healthier” across the follow-up period.
Gastric bypass surgery is associated with an inherent risk of developing vitamin and mineral 
deficiencies related to impairment of absorption and decreased food intake. Therefore, 
nutritional supplements were prescribed, according to Scandinavian clinical standards at that 
time. At 5 years after surgery we found a concerning prevalence of iron deficiency, 
associated low haemoglobin levels, and also vitamin D insufficiency. Poor compliance with 
supplementation may have contributed to this, as previously described. 17 This is an 
important area for improvement and recent guidance suggests adopting more aggressive 
supplementation, such as higher doses of vitamin D, as well as more effective compounds, 
such as calcium citrate rather than calcium carbonate. Regular access to long-term follow-up 
between 2 and 5 years may have ameliorated nutritional deficiencies.
Psychosocial impairment is highly prevalent in adolescents with severe obesity, 27 as was 
observed at baseline in this study. 17,28 We demonstrated improvement in obesity-related 
psychosocial problems in the surgical group over 5 years, as well as in generic self-reported 
quality of life, most notably in participants’ perceived general health and physical function. 
Improvements did not, however, occur across all aspects of quality of life, which should be 
communicated to patients and their families preoperatively to manage expectations. Specific 
attention must also be paid to identifying and helping individuals at risk of self-harm and 
suicide in this vulnerable group.
The accumulated in-hospital stay across 5 years was longer in the surgical group than the 
control group, which is in line with expectations given the primary procedure and incidence 
of complications and remedial interventions in the surgical group.29 Thus, the obesity-
related comorbid diseases observed in control adolescents, did not lead to a greater need for 
in-hospital treatments within 5 years of follow-up. Despite including routine prescribed 
nutritional supplementation, the observed costs of medication were no greater in the surgical 
group than the control group.
The rate of additional procedures in the surgical group was higher than that reported within 
the Teen-LABS study,16 primarily due to a high rate of intra-abdominal herniation 
associated with non-closure of mesenteric defects. 30 Also contributing was a higher rate of 
cholecystectomy for gallstones in our study; a consequence of significant rapid weight 
loss.31 Rates of small bowel obstruction and cholecystectomy were, however, similar in 
Olbers et al.

 Swedish adults undergoing the RYGB.30,32 Recent advances in practice have enabled 
reduction in the incidence of both internal herniation and gallstone formation by performing 
primary closure of mesenteric defects30 and administration of ursodeoxycholic acid 
prophylaxis,32 suggesting that the rate of additional surgery can be reduced by more than 
50%. 30,32
The overall risk-benefit equation must, however, also take into account both the existing and 
imminent health implications in young persons with severe obesity and the failure of other 
therapies to achieve sustainable improvements.10,13 Although a small proportion of control 
adolescents succeeded in reaching normal weight across 5 years (3%), not only did the vast 
majority (90%) fail to achieve reversal of their obesity, but most (69%) actually gained 
weight. Delaying surgery thus represents an avoidable prolongation of exposure to 
cardiometabolic risk factors, with risk of development or progression of comorbid diseases.7
Strengths of this study include respectable rates of retention throughout follow-up, 
particularly considering the nature of an adolescent population and a 5-year follow-up 
period. Surgical procedures in adolescents and adults were carried out by surgeons in a 
single centre, using a standardised and well-recognised technique,19 refined over thousands 
of procedures in adults. The adult group experienced an almost identical treatment pathway, 
minimising bias related to the treatment. The Swedish healthcare registries guarantee an 
accurate quantification of postoperative healthcare and medication usage. Limitations 
include a non-randomised setting and a pragmatic, non-standardised conservative treatment. 
However, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one long-term study of a specific 
conservative treatment of obesity including adolescents, which achieved only modest weight 
loss and lost almost 40% to follow-up across 5 years.33 A randomised controlled trial would 
have reduced the potential for selection bias, however, in the absence of safety and efficacy 
data, we considered this design challenging. Many of the adult group weight data points 
were self-reported, although evidence in an adult bariatric population shows that this leads to 
under-reporting of weight by just 0.8 to 0.9 kg,34 allaying our concerns. There was also 
some attrition in our patient number regarding laboratory and quality of life measurements. 
A 25% crossover to surgery in the control group during follow-up limited the comparability 
of the adolescent groups. Due to the limited size of the study population, and therefore the 
low number of adverse events, adjustment was performed for age and sex alone. RYGB was 
the only surgical procedure performed as sleeve gastrectomy was novel at the time, although 
it has been used in later adolescent series.16,35 Finally, although this is a nationwide study, 
caution should be exercised in generalisation to other populations and regions.
Conclusion
RYGB results in substantial weight loss, frequent resolution of cardiometabolic comorbidity, 
and improvement in quality of life into the long-term in adolescents suffering from severe 
obesity. In contrast, non-surgical treatment led to further weight gain and one in four control 
adolescents underwent surgery during 5-year follow up. Surgical intervention was, however, 
associated with a high rate of additional surgical intervention and nutritional deficiencies.

 The literature base now appears sufficiently mature to consider formal integration of 
bariatric surgery into treatment pathways for adolescents with severe obesity. However, we 
consider it crucial that adolescent bariatric surgery is performed within appropriate specialist 
multidisciplinary programmes, designed specifically to accommodate adolescent patients 
and provide long-term follow-up and support.
Future challenges include refining indications and contraindications, identifying ideal target 
age groups, and optimisation of postoperative support. We must also closely monitor for 
potential long-term adverse effects of surgery, across decades rather than years.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
Before 2006 there was a large and growing body of evidence relating to bariatric surgery 
in adults, particularly using the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), but only limited 
experience from adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery.
We searched PubMed from 14 February, 1956 to 13 February, 2006, for “adolescent” OR 
“child*” AND “gastric bypass” AND “obesity”, with no restrictions on language. Of 246 
items returned, we identified 6 relevant retrospective case series, including between 4 and 
39 genetically normal patients undergoing RYGB, and dating as far back as 1975.
With increasing awareness of the dramatic health risks associated with severe obesity in 
the adolescent population, and limited success among non-surgical treatments, positive 
outcomes in adults prompted consideration of bariatric surgery in adolescents on a case-
by-case basis in extreme circumstances. However, there was a paucity of prospective and 
systematic assessments of the risks and benefits in adolescents.
Within the limited existing case series, a mean BMI reduction of approximately 20 kg/m2 
was reported at least 1 year after RYGB, but there were fewer than 45 patients with 
follow-up to 5 years or longer. Several adolescents demonstrated improvement in obesity-
related metabolic axes, such as glucose homeostasis, lipids and blood pressure following 
surgery.
However, while these small series were certainly promising, inherent limitations rendered 
their results of limited reliability and generalisability. Most studies included a small 
number of participants and a retrospective design, many employing suboptimal methods 
of follow-up, without requiring clinic attendance, yet minor to moderate complications 
were relatively common.
Added value of this study
The added value of this prospective study predominantly lies in three areas. Firstly this 
study advances knowledge and understanding of the outcomes of RYGB among 
adolescents with severe obesity into the long-term, where previous prospective studies 
have reported outcomes up to 3 years after surgery thus far. Secondly, to the best of our 
knowledge, the present study is the first to concurrently examine a contemporary 
matched adolescent control group undergoing conventional treatment, and indeed a 
contemporary matched adult group undergoing RYGB, embedding the observed results 
within the context of the existing understanding of adult outcomes. Thirdly this study 
adds data from several national registries, expanding the outcomes reported in the 
literature to include healthcare consumption. We conclude, however, that there is a need 
to develop targeted strategies to reduce weight regain and avoid nutritional deficiencies in 
operated adolescents, and also to reduce the need for additional surgery.
Implications of all the available evidence
These long-term data extend knowledge beyond existing accumulated 2- and 3-year 
follow-up data from the US, Europe, Saudi Arabia and Australia, which have consistently

 supported the use of bariatric surgery in adolescents with severe obesity. Studies have 
shown that RYGB, sleeve gastrectomy and adjustable gastric banding are safe and 
effective in achieving and maintaining weight loss and significant metabolic health gains, 
often inducing remission of type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, dyslipidaemia and 
hypertension. The current evidence base, however, also highlights the challenges 
presented by performing bariatric surgery in adolescents.
We consider the literature base now sufficiently mature to consider formal integration of 
bariatric surgery into treatment pathways for adolescents with severe obesity. However, 
assessment of adolescents for surgery should be embedded within formal programmes 
incorporating all other available obesity treatments, led by a multidisciplinary team 
capable of conducting physical as well as psychosocial assessments of the individual 
patient. Provision must also be made for long-term follow-up and management, with 
concern for surgical and nutritional adverse events, avoidance of weight regain, and also 
for continuous psychological support when needed, knowing that this is a vulnerable 
patient group.
