BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of several cancers; however, greater detection of cancer around the
time of diabetes diagnosis may partly contribute to this relationship. The goal of the current study was to explore the temporal rela-
tionship between diabetes and cancer incidence. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study
of >1 million adults living in Ontario, Canada to evaluate the association between diabetes diagnosis and the incidence of cancer in 3
time periods: within the 10 years before a diabetes diagnosis, within the first 3 months after a diabetes diagnosis, and from 3 months
to 10 years after a diabetes diagnosis. RESULTS: Individuals with diabetes were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with
cancer within the 10 years before a diabetes diagnosis compared with individuals without diabetes (odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 1.19-1.27). Cancer incidence also was found to be significantly higher in individuals with diabetes within the 3-month
period after a diabetes diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.52-1.74), whereas the risk was not found to be elevated in the later pe-
riod (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98). Similar trends were noted for individual cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The results demon-
strated that individuals with diabetes had a significantly higher risk of most cancers, which was limited to the time periods before
and immediately after a diabetes diagnosis. The highest risk period was observed within the first 3 months after a diabetes diagnosis,
suggesting a partial role of detection bias in the apparent relationship between diabetes and cancer. Cancer 2016;122:2731-8. V

INTRODUCTION
There is mounting evidence of an association between type 2 diabetes and an increased risk of several cancers. The strong-
est relationships have been demonstrated for liver, pancreatic, and endometrial cancers, with more modest associations
noted for breast, colorectal, and bladder cancers.1,2 Recent evidence has suggested that the risk of cancer depends on the
timing between the diagnoses of diabetes and cancer, with the highest cancer risk period occurring shortly after a diabetes
diagnosis.3,4 This observation has been attributed to the increased detection of cancers around a diabetes diagnosis within
the setting of increased health contact.5-7
Given the long latency for the development of cancer, the spike in cancer incidence right after diabetes diagnosis also
may reflect a higher-risk period that predates the diagnosis of diabetes. The growth-promoting effects of hyperinsulinemia
that occur in the setting of insulin resistance have been postulated as a primary mechanism for the increased cancer risk
observed in individuals with type 2 diabetes.8 Hyperinsulinemia can predate the onset of diabetes by up to 10 years8;
therefore, the susceptibility to cancer may begin to increase well before the onset of diabetes.
To better determine the relative influence of these factors on cancer risk among individuals with diabetes, the current
population-based study sought to further evaluate the temporal relationship between diabetes and cancer by examining
cancer incidence before and after a diabetes diagnosis. The primary objective of the current study was to quantify the risk
of all cancers and specific cancer sites for individuals with versus those without diabetes in 3 different time periods around
diabetes diagnosis: within 10 years before diagnosis, within the first 3 months after diagnosis, and 3 months to 10 years af-
ter diagnosis.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
The current retrospective study used data from adminis-
trative health care databases in Ontario, Canada, which
include information regarding demographic characteris-
tics, physician claims, and hospital discharge abstracts for
all individuals eligible for coverage under the provincial
universal health insurance plan. Records were individually
linked across databases using a unique anonymized
patient identifier. We identified subjects with diabetes
using the validated Ontario Diabetes Database (ODD).
Individuals are included in the ODD if they either have 1
hospitalization or 2 physician service claims with a diag-
nosis of diabetes within a 2-year period. When using phy-
sician claims to record new diabetes cases, the index date
of the diabetes diagnosis is based on the date of the second
physician claim for diabetes.9 To focus on the population
with type 2 diabetes, we defined individuals with diabetes
as individuals aged �30 years with a new diagnosis of dia-
betes in the ODD between April 1, 1997 and March 31,
2007.
We used the linked Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR)
to identify individuals with incident cancer diagnoses.
The OCR contains data regarding all Ontario residents
who were diagnosed with or died of cancer (except for
nonmelanoma skin cancer) since 1964.10 The following
cancers were also identified, individually: pancreas, colo-
rectal, lung, liver, breast, endometrial, cervical, ovarian,
bladder, thyroid, and prostate cancer. Data sets were
linked using unique encoded identifiers and analyzed at
the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. The Ontario
Health Insurance Plan database provided information
regarding physician service claims.
Cancer Incidence After a Diabetes Diagnosis
We used a retrospective matched cohort design to esti-
mate associations between diabetes and cancer after a di-
agnosis of diabetes. We compared the incidence of a first
cancer between individuals with and individuals without
newly diagnosed diabetes within 2 time periods3: the first
3 months after a diabetes diagnosis and 3 months to 10
years after a diagnosis. We first identified individuals with
newly diagnosed diabetes during the study period and
who were without a prior cancer diagnosis. We then
matched each individual 1:1 based on sex and year of birth
with individuals without diabetes or cancer. For patients
with diabetes, the index date was the date of diagnosis
with diabetes. Nondiabetic controls were assigned who
did not have a diagnosis of diabetes on the index date of
their matched diabetic patient. Controls were censored if
they developed diabetes during the follow-up period.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was the occurrence of any incident
cancer within the 10-year period after the index date. The
secondary outcome was the occurrence of an incident
individual cancer: pancreatic, colorectal, lung, liver,
breast, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, bladder, thyroid,
and prostate cancer. Individuals who developed > 1 type
of cancer during the follow-up period were included sepa-
rately in analyses for each cancer site.
Statistical Analysis
To address the effect of timing on the association between
diabetes and the cause-specific hazard of a cancer diagno-
sis, we separated the postdiabetes period into 2 time inter-
vals: 0 to 3 months and 3 months to 10 years after the
index date.3 We calculated rates of cancer diagnosis per
1000 person-years (p-yr) in each of these 2 time periods
separately for individuals with and without diabetes. To
quantify the association between diabetes and cancer risk
after a diabetes diagnosis, we used a stratified Cox regres-
sion model adjusting for the number of physician visits
within the 2 years before the diagnosis of diabetes (0-5, 6-
12, 13-20, 21-34, and �35) and neighborhood income
quintile in the multivariable model. The model was strati-
fied on the matched sets. We calculated a separate hazard
ratio (HR) to quantify cancer risk for each of the time
windows. Individuals were followed until the first occur-
rence of any of the following: a record of cancer, death, 10
years after the index date, or loss of Ontario Health Insur-
ance Plan eligibility.
Sensitivity Analyses
To explore the period of time during which surveillance
bias may be most pronounced, we first repeated the pri-
mary analysis expanding the time window surrounding
the diabetes diagnosis to 6 months after diagnosis and
repeated analyses in the time periods of 0 to 6 months and
6 months to 10 years after diabetes diagnosis. Second, to
determine to what extent an elevated cancer risk among
patients newly diagnosed with diabetes is related to
enhanced health care contact, we repeated the primary
analyses evaluating the risk of 2 conditions that are often
diagnosed through opportunistic screening: osteoporosis
(a negative tracer that is less frequent in patients with type
2 diabetes)11 and hypothyroidism (a neutral tracer that to
our knowledge has not been associated with type 2 diabe-
tes). We also compared bone mineral density testing

 between patients with diabetes and controls during the
early and late time periods to evaluate whether enhanced
testing occurs around the time of a diabetes diagnosis.
Cancer Prevalence Before a Diabetes Diagnosis
To quantify the association between diabetes and cancer
before a diabetes diagnosis, we also compared cancer prev-
alence during the 10 years before a diagnosis of diabetes
(index date) between individuals with newly diagnosed di-
abetes and nondiabetic controls. We identified subjects
with newly diagnosed diabetes between April 1, 2003 and
March 31, 2007 and matched them with age-matched
and sex-matched controls who did not have diabetes on
the index date of their matched diabetic counterparts. In
contrast to our cohort analysis above, we used the first
rather than the second physician claim to define the date
of diabetes diagnosis to decrease the chance of reverse cau-
sality if a cancer was diagnosed between the first and sec-
ond diabetes claims.9
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was the first cancer recorded in the
OCR in the 10-year period before the index date. We
excluded all individuals with a cancer diagnosis before
that period (ie, � 10 years) and individuals who did not
have at least 10 years of health care data before the index
date. We recorded the following site-specific cancers as a
secondary outcome: pancreatic, colorectal, lung, liver,
breast, cervical, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, thyroid,
and bladder cancer. Individuals who developed > 1 type
of cancer during the look-back period were included sepa-
rately in analyses for each individual cancer site.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated cancer rates per 1000 p-yr for the 10-year
period preceding the index date for both the patients with
diabetes and the matched controls. We used conditional
logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs)
comparing the prevalence of any cancer and site-specific
cancers within the 10-year period preceding the index
date between those who did and did not have a diagnosis
of diabetes. In the multivariable models, we adjusted for
the number of physician visits within the 2 years before
the 10-year period preceding the index date (0-5, 6-12,
13-20, 21-34, and �35) and neighborhood income
quintile.

This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto.
RESULTS
Cancer Incidence After a Diagnosis of Diabetes
We identified 516,219 patients with diabetes, and
matched these with 516,219 nondiabetic controls, 46%
of whom were female with a mean age of 58.0 years
(standard deviation, 13.8 years) (Table 1). Compared
with controls without diabetes, patients with diabetes
were more likely to live in a lower income neighborhood
and to have a greater number of physician visits within the
2 years before cohort entry.
We identified 36,140 cancers in subjects with diabe-
tes and 33,156 cancers in the individuals without diabetes
during a median follow-up of 5.38 years. In the 3 months
after the diagnosis of diabetes, the incidence of any cancer
was 19.3 per 1000 p-yr in individuals with diabetes and
10.6 per 1000 p-yr in those without diabetes. During the
later period after a diabetes diagnosis, the rate of cancer
was 12.1 per 1000 p-yr in individuals with diabetes and
11.1 per 1000 p-yr in individuals without diabetes (Fig. 1
Top).
In the 3 months after the diagnosis of diabetes, the
adjusted rate of any cancer diagnosis was 62% higher
among individuals with diabetes compared with those
without diabetes (HR, 1.62; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 1.52-1.74). In contrast, there was a slight
decrease in the risk of a cancer diagnosis within the period
3 months to 10 years after a diabetes diagnosis (HR, 0.97;
95% CI, 0.95-0.98) (Fig. 2).
Individual Cancer Sites
Results for individual cancers are presented in Figure 2.
Diabetes was found to be associated with a significantly
increased risk of pancreatic, endometrial, liver, and thy-
roid cancers during both time periods. The risk was sub-
stantially higher within the first 3 months after a diabetes
diagnosis and declined in magnitude during the latter pe-
riod. In contrast, patients with diabetes had a significantly
elevated risk of colorectal and bladder cancers that was
limited to the immediate postdiabetes period; the associa-
tions became null within the 3 months to 10 years after a
diabetes diagnosis. There was no association noted
between breast, cervical, or ovarian cancer in any of the
postdiabetes periods. An elevated risk of prostate and lung
cancers was noted within the first 3 months after a diabe-
tes diagnosis but the risk was significantly reduced for dia-
betic patients in the later period (Fig. 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
The results were similar when we extended the immediate
postdiabetes diagnosis period to 6 months (0-6 months:

 HR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.33-1.46]; 6 months-10 years: HR,
0.96 [95% CI, 0.94-0.97]). We found no significant asso-
ciation between diabetes and osteoporosis within the first
3 months on multivariable analysis, but a significantly
lower risk associated with diabetes was noted in the later
period. The rate of bone mineral density testing was sig-
nificantly higher among patients with diabetes in the early
period, but was significantly lower than nondiabetic con-
trols in the later period. Individuals with diabetes were
more likely to be diagnosed with hypothyroidism within
the first 3 months after a diabetes diagnosis, whereas there
was no increased risk of hypothyroidism noted within the
period 3 months to 10 years after a diagnosis of diabetes
(Table 2).
Cancer Prevalence Before a Diabetes Diagnosis
There were 9090 cancers diagnosed in individuals within
the 10-year period before a diabetes diagnosis and 7466
cancers were diagnosed among controls who did not have
diabetes at the index date. The rate of cancer was 4.88%
in individuals who developed diabetes and 4.00% in con-
trols without diabetes (Fig. 1 Bottom). In multivariable
analyses, individuals who developed diabetes were 23%
more likely to have been diagnosed with cancer within the
10 years before the index date compared with individuals
without diabetes (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19-1.27) (Table
3).
Individual Cancer Sites
The occurrence of a prior cancer was significantly higher
for patients with diabetes versus those who did not have
diabetes for each individual cancer studied, except for
ovarian and cervical cancer (Table 3). For example, indi-
viduals who had diabetes were >3 times as likely to have
had pancreatic cancer within the period preceding a diabe-
tes diagnosis compared with individuals who did not

 develop diabetes (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.94-5.76). The dif-
ference in cancer prevalence between groups appeared to
be greatest in the 6 years before a diagnosis of diabetes
(Fig. 1 Bottom).
DISCUSSION
The results of this large, population-based study demon-
strate that diabetes is associated with a significantly
increased likelihood of being diagnosed with cancer.
However, the magnitude of the association varies substan-
tially depending on the time periods around the diabetes
diagnosis. We have shown that for the majority of cancer
sites, the association with diabetes is strongest within 10
years before or within the first 3 months after a diabetes
diagnosis. We also found similar trends for the likelihood
of a diagnosis of hypothyroidism and bone mineral den-
sity testing in patients newly diagnosed with diabetes.
These findings support the possibility that epidemiologic
associations between diabetes and cancer can be partially
explained by a detection bias around the time of a diabetes
diagnosis, when there is greater health care contact. The
current study findings also suggest that individuals with
diabetes have a higher risk of cancer even before a diagno-
sis of diabetes. The results of the current study have im-
portant implications for our understanding of the
complex relationship between these conditions, and may
help to inform the design of future studies and the coun-
seling of patients regarding their risk of cancer.
The results of the current study support those of pre-
vious studies that have explored the temporal relationship
between diabetes and cancer. Earlier studies by Johnson
et al in a different Canadian population and another by
Carstensen et al in Denmark both documented a strong
association between diabetes and cancer shortly after a di-
agnosis of diabetes, which subsequently declined as the
duration of diabetes increased.3,4 We believe the results of
the current study add to this evidence, but also suggest
that an increased risk of cancer may exist even before a di-
agnosis of diabetes. Similar to the study by Johnson et al,3
the results of the current study demonstrated a continued
risk of certain cancers in the later postdiabetes period.
However, for all cancer sites there was a decrease in cancer
risk noted within the period of 3 months to 10 years after
a diabetes diagnosis. This finding underscores the degree
to which previously unaccounted for detection bias may
have amplified the risk of cancer associated with diabetes
in earlier epidemiologic studies.
The results of the current study strengthen the evi-
dence that detection bias plays a role in the observed rela-
tionships between diabetes and cancer.3,4 This appears to
be more likely given that the risk of hypothyroidism, a
condition not associated with diabetes, was found to be
increased within the first 3 months after a diabetes diagno-
sis. Osteoporosis, a condition that is less common in indi-
viduals with diabetes,12,13 was not found to be increased
in the immediate postdiagnosis period; however, we did
observe an increase in the frequency of bone mineral test-
ing during this period. The increase in testing during this
period likely attenuated the known decreased risk of
osteoporosis and explains why we did not find an
increased risk of osteoporosis during this period. As would
be expected, there was no association found between
hypothyroidism and diabetes in the later postdiagnosis pe-
riod, and the risk of osteoporosis was decreased among
those with diabetes. The pattern of bone mineral testing,
which increased in the immediate postdiagnosis period
and decreased in the later postdiagnosis period, further
supports the likelihood of a detection bias in the relation-
ship between diabetes and cancer in the immediate post-
diagnosis period.
We also documented a 23% higher prevalence of
cancers among patients with diabetes in the 10-year pe-
riod preceding a diabetes diagnosis that was consistent for
nearly all individual cancers. This finding is consistent
with other studies that have shown a significantly higher

 rate of breast cancer14,15 and colon cancer16 before a diag-
nosis of diabetes. This observation may be due to shared
metabolic risk factors for diabetes and cancer that are pres-
ent during the prediabetes period, such as insulin resist-
ance and hyperinsulinemia.17 These metabolic alterations
may precede a clinical diagnosis of diabetes by up to 10
years, and insulin levels are in fact highest before the onset
of diabetes.8 Indeed, a meta-analysis of prospective cohort
studies found a significant association between prediabe-
tes and the risk of endometrial, liver, stomach, and colo-
rectal cancers.18 This mechanism also may contribute to
the spike in cancers observed in the early postdiagnostic
period, which were more likely to develop in individuals
with prediabetes but only manifest at the time of diabetes
diagnosis. Further studies are needed to better elucidate
the role of these prediabetic metabolic factors in promot-
ing the development of cancers.
The findings of the current study have significant
potential public health implications given the growing
prevalence of diabetes in many countries.19 These projec-
tions have implications not only for the future burden of
diabetes but also may mean higher rates of cancer. We
have excellent evidence that diabetes can be reversed with
physical activity and lifestyle interventions in high-risk
individuals.20,21 Such interventions are urgently needed
both on an individual and population level, not only to
reduce the risk of diabetes and vascular complications, but
also to potentially reduce the burden of cancer in this
population.
The strengths of the current study include the
population-based nature of the study cohort and the use of
validated sources to identify diabetes and cancer cases.
Given the large population in Ontario and our robust
event rates, the current study had substantial power that
may have limited previous studies. Second, we evaluated
cancer risk both in the period before diabetes diagnosis and
in the immediate and longer-term postdiabetes periods,
thereby providing a more comprehensive quantification of

 the temporal trends in this epidemiologic association.
Finally, the inclusion of tracer outcomes has provided
more compelling evidence of the role of a detection bias in
the relationship between diabetes and cancer.
However, there are limitations to the current study.
First, because administrative databases were used, we did
not have access to laboratory and clinical data such as he-
moglobin A1c and body mass index, which are known
confounders. We also did not have comprehensive infor-
mation regarding risk factors, medications, and other
comorbidities that might have influenced the study find-
ings. Second, we did not have information regarding how
and at what stage each condition was detected (whether
clinically or through screening). Specifically, we could not
determine the time of the true onset of diabetes or cancer
within our databases but had to rely on when they were
diagnosed, which may have occurred at various stages of
disease progression. Finally, we cannot exclude the contri-
bution of a survival bias in the current analysis of cancer
prevalence before a diagnosis of diabetes in that patients
had to survive long enough to develop diabetes. However,
this bias might have attenuated the positive association
between diabetes and cancer prevalence because patients
with cancer have lower survival and therefore would be
less likely to develop diabetes.
The current large, population-based study demon-
strated a significant association between diabetes and can-
cer, which was found to be strongest in the immediate
period after a diagnosis of diabetes for most cancers. These
findings suggest that the relationship between diabetes
and cancer can be explained in part by detection bias,
whereby there is enhanced detection of cancers within the
setting of increased health care around a diabetes diagno-
sis. A previous history of cancer also was more likely in
individuals with diabetes, indicating that shared risk fac-
tors may contribute to this association. Although further
research is needed to confirm these findings, enhanced
cancer screening and cancer prevention strategies in
patients with and at risk of developing diabetes may be
warranted.
