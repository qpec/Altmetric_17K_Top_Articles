Abstract
Cancer incidence increase has multiple aetiologies. Mutant alleles accumulation in pop-
ulations may be one of them due to strong heritability of many cancers. The opportu-
nity for the operation of natural selection has decreased in the past ~150 years because 
of reduction in mortality and fertility. Mutation- 
selection balance may have been dis-
turbed in this process and genes providing background for some cancers may have 
been accumulating in human gene pools. Worldwide, based on the WHO statistics for 
173 countries the index of the opportunity for selection is strongly inversely correlated 
with cancer incidence in peoples aged 0–49 years and in people of all ages. This rela-
tionship remains significant when gross domestic product per capita (GDP), life expec-
tancy of older people (e50), obesity, physical inactivity, smoking and urbanization are 
kept statistically constant for fifteen (15) of twenty- 
seven (27) individual cancers inci-
dence rates. Twelve (12) cancers which are not correlated with relaxed natural selection 
after considering the six potential confounders are largely attributable to external 
causes like viruses and toxins. Ratios of the average cancer incidence rates of the 10 
countries with lowest opportunities for selection to the average cancer incidence rates 
of the 10 countries with highest opportunities for selection are 2.3 (all cancers at all 
ages), 2.4 (all cancers in 0–49 years age group), 5.7 (average ratios of strongly geneti-
cally based cancers) and 2.1 (average ratios of cancers with less genetic background).

1 | INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, cancer incidence rate has increased to make it the second 
leading cause of death after cardiovascular disease. Environmental 
factors, such as tobacco smoking, urbanization and its associated 
pollution and changing diet patterns together with increased wealth 
associated with better medical services and extended postreproduc-
tive life span, have been considered responsible for this phenome-
non. Prevention and treatment measures focusing on environmental 
factors have been implemented, but little progress in reducing inci-
dence of cancers has been made (Global Burden of Disease Cancer 
Collaboration, 2015).
Malignant neoplasms are results of somatic mutations of certain 
genes (Croce, 2008; Vogelstein & Kinzler, 2004). Studies investigating 
transmission of cancer susceptibility in family lines suggested genetic 
background for incidence of many types of malignancies (Tian et al., 
2015). It is possible, then that this background contributes to increas-
ing incidence of cancers at the population level.
Mutations are more common than previously thought (Conrad et 
al., 2011; Crow, 2000; Henn, Botigué, Bustamante, Clark, & Gravel, 
2015). For instance, it has been estimated that an average neonate has 
some 74 de novo point mutations (Conrad et al., 2011; Lynch, 2016). 
Multiple mutations may accumulate in genomes over time spanning 
just a few generations (Stephan & Henneberg, 2001). When selection

against a certain mutation does not operate, the frequency of mutated 
alleles doubles every generation (Bodmer & Cavalli- 
Sforza, 1976). The 
mutation load is directly proportional to the mutation rate and inversely 
proportional to the rate of selection (Bodmer & Cavalli- 
Sforza, 1976; 
Crow, 1958). Thus, when selection rates approach zero, mutation load 
approaches infinity. These rates are expressed per generation. Human 
generations do overlap due to the length of the reproductive life span 
which in females is approximately 30 years. Assuming, for simplicity’s 
sake, zero selection, it can be shown that mutation load at a given locus 
can triple or quadruple during one century (three to four generations). 
In the recent past, selection operating in human populations has been 
significantly relaxed (Crow, 1958; Lynch, 2016; Rühli & Henneberg, 
2013) by medical and public health actions. This results in accumula-
tion of mutations, especially mildly deleterious mutations. Interactions 
between alleles of various loci may magnify mutation rates including 
rates of somatic mutations that result in neoplastic cell growth because 
of the way DNA replicates and is repaired which is similar in germline 
and in somatic cells (Lynch, 2016). Combination of effects of mutations 
with relaxed selection produces a real possibility of deterioration of bi-
ological integrity of human organisms, observable in the time of a few 
generations in most advanced societies.
Human morphological characteristics that have a heritable, poly-
genic background have been evolving during the Holocene very fast; 
for example, rate of cranial capacity change was −10.8 darwins while 
the cranial index (the ratio of braincase width to its length) changed 
at a rate of +65.2 darwins (Rühli & Henneberg, 2016) and stature at 
+606.2 darwins (Henneberg, 2004). These are polygenic characters 
with incomplete heritability, and we cite them here as an illustration 
of how development of technological and social adaptations lower-
ing natural selection rates in the last few millennia can influence the 
course of change in human biological characteristics.
Natural selection is a process that differentiates reproduction 
of individual genes into new generations depending on how genetic 
endowment of parents influences the number of offspring that will 
replace them in the future (Fisher, 1999). Following Fisher’s (1958) 
definition of the reproductive value, “Biological State Index (Ibs)” has 
been proposed to measure an opportunity for an average member 
of a population to pass genes to the next generation. Ibs calcula-
tion combines data on mortality and fertility (Budnik & Henneberg, 
2017; Henneberg, 1976; Henneberg & Piontek, 1975; Stephan & 
Henneberg, 2001; You & Henneberg, 2016). The formula (Henneberg, 
1976; Henneberg & Piontek, 1975) for Ibs calculation is as follows:
where dx = the frequency of deaths at age x; sx = the probability of 
not possessing the complete number of births at age x; ω = the age at 
death of the oldest member of the group.
Ibs expresses a probability for an average individual born into a 
population to pass on genes to the next generation. Index value of 
1.0 means that there is no opportunity for natural selection through 
differential mortality because all individuals survive until the end of 
their reproductive period.
This index is a more precise calculation than what Crow (1958) 
called the Pd (Crow, 1958)—proportion of individuals dying before 
reaching age of reproduction that is used to calculate the index of total 
selection due to mortality. For this index, a “…source of error is that 
no allowance was made for women who died during the childbearing 
period after having one or more children.” (Crow, 1958). In the Ibs, such 
allowance is made using sx and dx values for ages 15–49 years. By anal-
ogy to the Crow’s mortality index of Pd/Ps (where Ps is a proportion of 
individuals surviving to the reproductive age), an index of total oppor-
tunity for selection through differential mortality (including its portion 
during reproductive years) is constructed Is = (1- 
Ibs)/Ibs. Theoretically, 
following Fisher’s formulation, the opportunity for selection must in-
clude the variance of fertility, more precisely, this portion of the vari-
ance of fertility that is heritable Vf/x2 (where x is the average number 
of children per female surviving to the menopause and Vf variance of 
this number). In humans, however, heritable variance in actual fertility 
is very low even in couples who do not control family size. According 
to our study (Henneberg, 1980) of 7,503 births from 1,525 Polish 
and American historical couples in 12 groups free of conscious birth 
control, the genetic variance of fertility is less than 0.01 of its squared 
mean. Furthermore, considering that in developed countries, con-
scious birth control has been practiced for over 100 years and became 
widespread in at least the last two generations, further diminishing any 
heritable fertility differentials, the contribution of genetic variance in 
fertility to the opportunity for natural selection in humans is practically 
nonexistent. Therefore, the use of Is measuring opportunity for selec-
tion through differential mortality provides sufficient approximation of 
the maximum selective pressures in modern human populations.
The primary role of natural selection is that of the “janitor of the 
gene pool” purging deleterious mutations. In the past ~100 years, 
there has been a great reduction in mortality and in fertility that has 
been limiting the overall opportunity for natural selection (Henneberg, 
1976; Saniotis & Henneberg, 2011; Stephan & Henneberg, 2001). It 
follows that genes potentially providing background for some cancers 
have been accumulating in various populations. Cancer incidence may 
be greater in those populations who have experienced less opportu-
nity for natural selection.
We hypothesize that in a global perspective, extent of relaxation 
of natural selection in various national populations may be positively 
correlated with greater cancer incidence.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
The country- 
specific variables were collected for this ecological study.
1. Dependent variables: The GLOBOCAN 2012 estimates of inci-
dence rates (C50) (Ferlay et al., 2013)
We extracted the cumulative incidence rates of all cancers excl. non-
melanoma skin cancer (C00- 
97, but C44) among people of all ages and 
people aged 0–49 years, respectively, for 184 countries. We also cap-
tured separate estimates of incidence rates of 27 site cancers from the

same source of data for people of all ages. The site cancers are as follows: 
lip and oral cavity (C00- 
08), nasopharynx (C11), other pharynx (C09- 
10,C12- 
14), oesophagus (C15), stomach (C16), colorectum (C18- 
21), 
liver (C22), gallbladder (C23- 
24), pancreas (C25), larynx (C32), lung (C33- 
34), melanoma of skin (C43), Kaposi sarcoma (C46), breast (C50), cervix 
uteri (C53), corpus uteri (C54), ovary (C56), prostate (C61), testis (C62), 
kidney (C64- 
66), bladder (C67), brain (C70- 
72), thyroid (C73), Hodgkin 
lymphoma (C81), non- 
Hodgkin lymphoma (C82- 
85,C96), multiple my-
eloma (C88 + C90) and leukaemia (C91- 
95). The cancer incidence rate 
indicates the number per 100,000 persons who were diagnosed with 
cancer in 2012. The rate was age- 
standardized using the world standard 
population to increase the comparability.
Women age 50+ years enter menopause, which brings their fertil-
ity to zero. Female reproductive behaviour has been associated with 
various female cancers (Britt & Short, 2012; MacMahon et al., 1970; 
Ramazzini, 1983). The Ibs reflects mortality up to the age 50 years, 
considered the end of the reproductive life span, because s50+ values 
equal zero (thus any d50+ values are multiplied by zero). This means that 
natural selection we measure cannot “reach” beyond age 50 years. For 
these reasons, we included specifically the incidence rate of all can-
cers in the age range 0–49 years (prereproductive and reproductive 
life span) as these cancers can directly produce mortality and fertility 
differentials influencing reproductive success of individuals.
2. Independent variable: The index (Is = (1-Ibs)/Ibs) of natural selec-
tion opportunity at population level
The Ibs was calculated (Henneberg, 1976; Henneberg & Piontek, 
1975) with the data of the world fertility published by United Nations in 
2008 (The United Nations, 2012) and the data of life tables published by 
World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009 (WHO, 2012).
James Crow (1958), based on the Fisher’s (1958) concept of the 
reproductive value (Grafen, 2006), proposed to measure the total op-
portunity for natural selection (I) as the ratio of variance in offspring 
size of a couple (V) to the squared average offspring size of a couple 
(x2) that will replace parents in the next generation. In the application 
to human populations, this approach encounters two problems. The 
first is the birth control, which is very substantial in many modern 
societies. The second one is the overlapping of generations due to 
long reproductive period of females and males. The first problem can 
be tackled by separating contributions of fertility and mortality to the 
opportunity for selection and using only the portion of selection re-
sulting from mortality. According to Crow (Crow, 1958), the index of 
opportunity for natural selection through differential mortality (Im) is 
the ratio of individuals dying before reaching reproductive age (Pd) to 
the individuals surviving (Ps): Im = Pd/Ps. As not all individuals surviv-
ing to reproductive maturity will survive through the entire reproduc-
tive life span, a correction for deaths during the reproductive period 
is needed. This is introduced in the form of the Biological State Index 
(Ibs) that combines age- 
specific mortality (dx) with age- 
specific oppor-
tunity for producing offspring in the future life (sx) (Henneberg, 1976; 
Henneberg & Piontek, 1975). The Biological State Index accumulates 
mortality data in the way similar to “survival” biometric function of 
the life table and depends on the distribution of age- 
specific relative 
fertility expressed as the fraction of the total fertility rate remaining 
to be produced by a person of age x. Multiplication of the Ibs value 
for a given population by the total fertility rate of this population 
(number of children born by females surviving to the menopause) 
produces the net reproductive rate, a generational measure of popu-
lation growth. Details regarding Ibs are explained in several previously 
published studies (Budnik & Henneberg, 2017; Henneberg, 1976; 
Henneberg & Piontek, 1975; Rühli & Henneberg, 2013, 2016; You &

Henneberg, 2016). Considering low heritable variance of fertility and 
the widespread birth control that allow us to neglect opportunity for 
natural selection through differential fertility (Henneberg 1980), the 
index of the total opportunity for selection in modern populations is 
Is = (1- 
Ibs)/Ibs. The lower the value of this index, the less opportunity 
for natural selection exists. None of the three indices discussed here 
(Im, Ibs or Is) has any unit because they are ratios of offspring numbers 
or proportions and probabilities. Indices of the opportunity for selec-
tion measure the upper limit of the total selection pressure. Actual se-
lection pressures can be lower because not all mortality differentials 
are heritable, but the magnitude of selection cannot exceed index 
values. Therefore, decreasing values of opportunity for selection indi-
ces certainly show reduction in possibility of selection to occur, while 
they do not measure the actual magnitude of selection that can be 
lower.
Gross domestic product per capita (GDP), life expectancy of older 
people (e50), obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), prevalence rate (WHO, 2015), 
physical inactivity prevalence rate (Allender, Foster, Hutchinson, & 
Arambepola, 2008; Moore, Gould, & Keary, 2003; WHO, 2010), smoking 
and urbanization (Allender et al., 2008; Blot, Fraumeni, & Stone, 1977; 
Greenberg, 1983; Nasca, Mahoney, & Wolfgang, 1992) have been asso-
ciated with cancer initiation. They were considered as the confounders 
when we conducted the data analysis in this study.
3. The World Bank published data (The World Bank Group, 2016) 
on GDP
GDP is used as the index of socio- 
economic level, and it is ex-
pressed in per capita purchasing power parity (PPP in current interna-
tional USD) in 2010. Socio- 
economic levels measured with GDP have 
been related to cancer incidence rate (Blot et al., 1977; Ferlay et al., 
2013, 2015; Jemal et al., 2011).
4. The United Nations Statistics Division estimates of the life ex-
pectancy (United Nations-Department of Economic and Social 
Affairs-Population Division, 2013)
Increasing life expectancy of older people, indexing ageing in this 
study, has been considered as a factor possibly promoting increasing 
cancer incidence (Breastcancer.org, 2016; Majeed, Babb, Jones, & 
Quinn, 2000). Therefore, the life expectancy (e50, 1990–1995) was 
extracted from abridged life tables (1950–2100) (United Nations- 
Department of Economic and Social Affairs- 
Population Division, 2013) 
published online by the United Nations.
5. The WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) data on estimated 
obesity prevalence rate, physical inactivity, smoking rate and 
urbanization (WHO, 2015)
The obesity prevalence is expressed as the per cent of population 
(2010) aged 18+ with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2.
Physical inactivity is defined as the per cent of a particular popula-
tion attaining less than 150 min of moderate- 
intensity physical activity 
per week, or less than 75 min of vigorous- 
intensity physical activity 
per week, or equivalent in 2010.
Smoking is expressed as the per cent of adults aged 15 years and 
over (age- 
standardized rate) who smoked any tobacco product daily 
in 2010.
Urbanization is expressed with the per cent of total population liv-
ing in urban areas in 2010. Urbanization, representing a major demo-
graphic shift, entails lifestyle changes, including diet with more energy 
dense components, such as high fat and high alcohol consumption in 
daily diet, and less physical exercise.
2.1 | Data selection
We used country- 
specific cancer incidence rates, life tables and fertil-
ity rates (for Is calculation), GDP, life expectancy at 50 years of age 
(e50), obesity prevalence rate, physical inactivity prevalence rate, 
smoking and urbanization for all countries where data were available. 
We aligned cancer incidence rates with Is by country, and we obtained 
a set of data consisting of 173 countries. Quality of the country- 
specific cancer estimation depends upon the quality and the amount 
of the information available for each country (International Agency 
for Research on Cancer (IARC), 2012). For data robustness check, 
we clustered the countries with “high- 
quality” data as defined by the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (International 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 2012),obtaining a subset of 
data comprising 64 countries. This smaller data set was analysed 
separately from the other set of data consisting of all 173 countries. 
Country- 
specific GDP, life expectancy (e50), obesity prevalence rate, 
physical inactivity prevalence rate, smoking and urbanization were 
matched with the listing of 173 countries which have both cancer in-
cidence rate and Is. Numbers of countries included in the analysis of 
relationships with other variables may have differed somewhat be-
cause all information was not uniformly available for all countries.
All data included in this study were published by UN agencies. 
No ethical approval or written informed consent for participation was 
required.
2.2 | Data analysis
Various statistical analysis methods were applied in this study to 
explore the correlation between Is and cancer incidence rates. Each 
country was treated as an individual subject in the analysis. To exam-
ine the correlation between Is and cancer incidence rates, the analysis 
proceeded in five steps:
1. Pearson’s r and nonparametric correlations (Spearman’s “rho”) 
were used to evaluate the strength and direction of the cor-
relation between all the variables. Pearson’s correlations and 
partial correlations were calculated using log-transformed (ln) 
variables to minimize nonhomoscedascity of their distributions. 
Fisher’s z-transformation of correlation coefficients was used to 
assess significance of individual correlation coefficients values 
and of differences between correlation coefficients values.

2. The independent relationships between Is and each cancer incidence 
rate for all ages were explored with partial correlation of Pearson’s 
moment-product approach while we controlled for the six variables, 
which are GDP (Ferlay et al., 2015), life expectancy (e50) (American 
Cancer Society, 2015; Colditz & Wei, 2012; McPherson, Steel, & 
Dixon, 2000), obesity prevalence rate (Danaei et al., 2005; Colditz & 
Wei, 2012), physical inactivity prevalence rate (Danaei et al., 2005), 
smoking (Colditz & Wei, 2012; Danaei et al., 2005) and urbanization 
(Danaei et al., 2005). Life expectancy (e50) was not controlled for 
when the independent relationship between cancer incidence rate 
among the people aged 0–49 years and Is was studied because this 
potential confounder is not relevant to this group of people.
We controlled for GDP not only because it stands for cancer treat-
ment service, but also because it is associated with cancer diagnoses 
level. Therefore, we considered GDP as a potential confounder and con-
trolled for in our data analysis, which may reduce the influence of GDP 
associated cancer diagnose rate.
Urbanization, representing a major demographic shift, entails life-
style changes, including diet with more energy dense components, 
such as high fat, high alcohol consumption, less vegetables and fruits 
in daily diet, and less physical exercise (Allender et al., 2008; Moore 
et al., 2003; WHO, 2010).
Those individual (site) cancers whose incidence rates were signifi-
cantly and negatively correlated with Is in partial correlation are clas-
sified as “cancers with strong genetic background.” Those individual 
cancers whose incidence rates were not significantly or negatively 
correlated with Is are called “Less genetic cancers.”
Cohen’s f2 was used to calculate and to report the “effect size” in 
this study.
3. Standard multiple linear regression (enter) was performed to 
describe the relationships between the outcome variables (all 
cancers among all ages and 0–49 years age group) and the 
explanatory variables (GDP, life expectancy [e50], obesity preva-
lence rate, physical inactivity prevalence rate, smoking (Danaei 
et al., 2005) and urbanization (Danaei et al., 2005)). Standard 
multiple linear regression (stepwise) was performed to identify 
the most significant predictors of all cancer incidence rates among 
all ages and 0–49 years, respectively.
Life expectancy of older people (e50) was not included as an indepen-
dent predictor in the standard multiple linear regression analysis when 
we explored the relationships between all cancer incidence rate among 
the population aged 0–49 years and Is because this potential confounder 
is not relevant to this group of people.
4. To demonstrate the universal association between all cancer 
incidence rate (all ages) and Is, we categorized the countries for 
correlation analyses based on the following: (i) the WHO regional 
classifications, 
Africa 
(AFR), 
Americas 
(AMR), 
Eastern 
Mediterranean (EMR), Europe (EU), South-East Asia (SEAR) and 
Western Pacific (WPR) (WHO); (ii) the World Bank income 
classifications: high income, upper middle income, low-middle 
income and low income; and (iii) countries with the strong con-
trast in terms of geographic distributions, per capita GDP levels 
and/or cultural backgrounds. We analysed the correlation in the 
six country groupings: the Arab World (The World Bank, 2015), 
countries with English as the official language (government web-
sites), 
the 
Organisation 
for 
Economic 
Co-operation 
and 
Development (OECD) (The OECD, 2015), the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation), Asia 
Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) (Asia Cooperation Dialogue) and the 
Southern African Development Community (SADC). In our analysis, 
we only included those countries for which we could access 
their data for the specific groupings. To a large extent, grouping 
countries for analysis may also allow us to align our findings 
against previous local or regional studies regarding heterogeneous 
cancer epidemiology due to various geographic locations and 
ethnicity.
Socio- 
economic level in different regions has been considered as the 
major contributor to regional variations of cancer incidence rates (Ferlay 
et al., 2013; Ferlay et al., 2015; Jemal et al., 2011). Therefore, the correla-
tion coefficients between groupings in different socio- 
economic levels 
were compared with Fisher’s r- 
to- 
z transformation.
5. IARC-WHO has reported that GDP is associated with cancer 
incidence rate (Ferlay et al., 2013, 2015; IARC, 2012; Jemal 
et al., 2011). Naturally, this drove us to consider the incidence 
rate of all cancers (all ages) without the contributing effect of 
GDP. This allows us to explore the association between Is and 
incidence rate of all cancers (all ages) which excludes the con-
tributing effect of GDP.
Scatter plots (simple regression analysis) were used to explore and 
visualize the correlations between all cancer incidence rate (all ages) and 
Is. The strength and form of the relationship between incidence rate of all 
cancers (all ages) and Is was analysed using actual values of the two vari-
ables. The equation of the best fitting trendline (logarithmic) displayed in 
the scatter plots analysis of relationship between GDP and all cancer (all 
ages) incidence rate was used to calculate and remove the contributing 
effect of GDP on all cancer (all ages) incidence rate. This allowed us to 
obtain a new dependent variable “Residual of all cancer (all ages) inci-
dence standardized on GDP.” The relationship between Is and “Residual 
of all cancers (all ages) incidence standardized on GDP” was explored 
with scatter plots (Figure 2).
In order to assess the magnitude of possible changes in the inci-
dence of cancers due to relaxation of natural selection, we have calcu-
lated a “rate of incidence increase” by dividing the average incidence 
rates in the 10 countries with the lowest Is values by the average 
incidence rates in the 10 countries with the highest Is values. These 
rates allow us to estimate to what extent alteration of the mutation- 
selection balance over short periods could be responsible for the 
change in incidence. This is an approximate measure because other 
(nongenetic) factors may also influence incidence rates.

Pearson, nonparametric and partial correlations, and the multi-
ple linear regression analysis were conducted using SPSS v. 22 (SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Scatter plots and calculation of “Residual of all 
cancer (all ages) incidence standardized on GDP” were performed in 
Excel® (Microsoft 2016). The raw data are used for scatter plots and 
calculation of “Residual of all cancer (all ages) incidence standardized 
on GDP.” The significance value is recorded for each correlation, and 
significance level is kept at the 0.05, but 0.01 and 0.001 levels can be 
found from the reported actual significance values. Standard multiple 
linear regression analysis criteria were set at probability of F to enter 
≤.05 and probability of F to remove ≥.10.
3 | RESULTS
The relationship between Is and all cancer incidence was nega-
tive and strong (R2 = 0.5435, Figure 1). When the contributing 
effect of GDP on all cancer incidence rates was removed, Is was 
still in negative and significant correlation to all cancer incidence 
(R2 = 0.1187, Figure 2).
Globally, Is was significantly and negatively correlated with the 
incidence rates of all cancers at all ages (r = −.738, p < .001) and at 
0–49 years (r = −.719, p < .001) in Spearman rho analysis (Table 1). 
This relationship trend remained (r = −.319, p < .001 and r = −.380, 
p < .001, respectively) when we controlled for potential confounding 
effects of GDP, life expectancy, obesity, physical inactivity, smoking 
and urbanization in partial correlation analysis (Table 1). When explor-
ing partial correlations of Is to individual cancers, significant negative 
correlation was found for 15 of 27 site cancers (Table 1). Similar results 
were observed in the correlation analysis with the data comprising 64 
countries with “high- 
quality” data (Table 1). Rates of incidence increase 
for all cancers at all ages (2.3) and in 0–49 years age group (2.4) are 
practically the same, while for individual cancers these rates of inci-
dence increase vary from fractional (=decrease) for cancers not signifi-
cantly or not negatively correlated with Is to over 10 for some cancers 
significantly negatively correlated with Is. Overall, for cancers with the

aLife expectancy (e50) was not controlled as it is not relevant in people aged 0–49 years.
bPartial correlations were calculated when GDP, life expectancy (e50), obesity, physical inactivity, smoking and urbanization were kept statistically constant.
cRatio of lowest 10 Is countries to highest Is 10 countries: Average strong genetic cancer incidence rate ratio: 5.718, Average less genetic cancer incidence rate ratio 2.143. “Strong genetic cancer” refers to those 
individual (site) cancers whose incidence rates were significantly and negatively correlated with Is in partial correlation. “Less genetic cancers” refers to those individual cancers whose incidence rates were not 
significantly or negatively correlated with Is.

strong genetic background which were significantly negatively cor-
related with Is, the average rate of incidence increase is 5.7 while for 
the less genetic cancers, the average rate of incidence increase is 2.1.
Relationships between Is and some site cancer correlations are 
 
illustrated in Figure 3. As can be seen, cancers that had predominantly 
external causes such as cervical cancer or oesophageal cancer showed 
no correlation to Is, while those with possible genetic background do 
correlate with Is. Partial correlation between Is and 15 cancers re-
mained significant after removal of the confounding effects (Table 1) 
of the six potential confounders.
The multiple linear regression model (Table 2) showed that, glob-
ally, Is had the greatest beta coefficient than the potential confounders 
in the “Enter” analysis, whereas the stepwise regression model iden-
tified Is as the most significant predictor of all cancers incidence rates 
among all ages and 0–49. Similar results were revealed after the mul-
tiple linear regression model was calculated within the dataset which 
only included those 64 countries with “high- 
quality” data.
Is was correlated with incidence rate of all cancers (all ages) univer-
sally in all country groupings (Table 3). However, there was a tendency 
for the correlations to be stronger in the more developed country 
groupings than those in the less developed groupings. This trend was 
revealed in country groupings divided in consideration of geographic 
locations (5 WHO regions), income classifications (four groups of the 
World Bank) and other factors, such as cultural backgrounds (Arab 
World, countries with English as official language) and international 
organizations (OECD, APEC, ACD, SADC).
The more developed regions, Americas and Europe, had stronger 
correlations than those in other regions. Fisher’s r- 
to- 
z transformation 
revealed that the correlation between Is and incidence rate of all 
cancers (all ages) in Europe was significantly stronger than those in 
the three developing regions, Africa (z = 4.41, p < .001), Eastern 
Mediterranean (z = 3.8, p < .001) and South- 
East Asia (z = 2.78, 
p = .0027). It was also revealed that in the World Bank income classifi-
cations, the correlation between Is and incidence rate of all cancers (all 
ages) in the upper middle income grouping was significantly stronger 
than that in low- 
income classification (z = 2.48, p = .0066).
The correlation between Is and incidence rate of all cancers (all 
ages) in high- 
income classification was not as strong as that in the 
upper middle classification. It was almost the same as that in the low- 
middle classification (Table 3).
4 | DISCUSSION
Incidence rates of all cancers and of most separate site cancers 
showed strong and significant correlation to reduced natural selec-
tion, measured by Is. It is especially important that this relationship is 
strong in the younger part of the population which are in prereproduc-
tive (0–14) and reproductive (15–49) periods.
It is important that we list the limitations, including the intrinsic 
limitations (conceptualized as ecological fallacy) to this study, before 
examining the public health implications of our results. Firstly, the data 
included in this study were for whole nations, so we may only demon-
strate the relationships between Is and cancer incidence at macrolevel. 
We also need to note that it is nearly impossible to test such relationship 
at the individual or germline level due to very rare cancer occurrence 
FIGURE 3 The relationship between relaxation of natural selection and incidence of selected cancers

rates. Secondly, data compiled and/or collected by the major interna-
tional agencies (WHO, IARC and the World Bank) are fairly crude and 
may contain some random errors arising from methods of reporting 
incidence of specific diseases, reliability of diagnoses and possible 
administrative errors. Thirdly, not all the contributing factors, such as 
alcohol consumption, can be included as the potential confounders in

data analysis due to data availability or quality. Furthermore, the op-
portunity for natural selection is only measured with respect to post-
natal mortality, while gametic selection and intrauterine mortality are 
not included (Rühli & Henneberg, 2016). Despite these limitations, the 
findings in this study from different data analysis methods constantly 
and consistently showed significant correlation between reduced 
natural selection and all cancers incidence (all ages and 0–49, respec-
tively) and incidence of most of site- 
specific cancer groups, especially 
those for which genetic background may be expected. Obviously, the 
changes in the genetic code of the human populations may not fully 
explain the increasing cancer incidence rate. These changes may be 
cumulative, each one of minor effect and may contribute to increasing 
cancer incidence together with other carcinogenic factors.
Various genes contribute to cancer, for example proto- 
oncogenes, 
can increase proliferation of mutated cells and tumour suppressor 
genes could inhibit self- 
regulation of abnormal cells, but their bal-
ance may still increase cancer incidence in various ways because 
these genes have pleiotropic effects. In this study, some of cancer 
groups have incidences that do not correlate with Is value, or even 
show reversed correlations (Table 1, Figure 3). These include cancers 
of well- 
known viral causes—cervical cancer—immune problem- 
related 
cancers like non- 
Hodgkin lymphoma, and cancers caused by toxins, 
like lip and oral cavity cancers. These cancers also have incidence “in-
creases” below zero indicating their greater incidence in countries with 
larger opportunity for natural selection. This is most likely a result of 
countries with greater mortality having also poorer hygienic conditions 
and less medical services.
While specific genes determining risks of specific cancers may 
be still unknown, the general tendency is clear—relaxation of natu-
ral selection allows accumulation of detrimental genetic material, 
especially if single detrimental alleles have mild effects (Henn et al., 
2015). Studies have shown that a partially heritable disease, phenyl-
ketonuria, was only noticeable after being accumulated for several 
generations (Stephan & Henneberg, 2001) with about 2% increase 
each (Medawar, 1971). Two recent studies also reported that relaxed 
natural selection has been contributing to the increasing prevalence 
of two noncommunicable diseases, obesity (Budnik & Henneberg, 
2017) and type 1 diabetes (You & Henneberg, 2016) because it may 
allow detrimental gene accumulation in human population. However 
crudely calculated our rates of “incidence increase” (Table 1) indicate 
rates of increase compatible with alteration of mutation- 
selection 
balance. We only have at our disposal recent data, but it can be hy-
pothesized that observed differences among countries in the oppor-
tunity for natural selection have existed for a few generations. With a 
simple accumulation of mutations under zero selection, the incidence 
rates should double every generation, when selection is not entirely 
relaxed, but still strongly limited, the increase will be somewhat less 
than double. Considering that declines in mortality in “developed” 
countries started in the second half of the 19th century, we can esti-
mate that changes in mutation- 
selection rates occurred over lifetime 
of some four, maybe five, generations. Incidence increases of all can-
cers (2.3–2.4) indicate approximately doubling over that time, while 
for cancers correlated significantly with Is the average increase is 5.7. 
Of course, not the entire incidence increase can be attributed to alter-
ation in mutation- 
selection balance, because quality of data collection 
and reporting and presence of carcinogenic external factors may dif-
fer between the 10 countries of the lowest opportunity for selection 
and 10 countries of the highest selection opportunity. Our choice of 
10 countries of each kind, instead of only five or 20, also influences 
precision of the numerical indices calculated. What is important here 
is that the order of magnitude of incidence increases, and their pos-
itive relationship to the relaxation of selection, especially in cancers 
with supposed genetic background, is compatible with expectations 
of population genetics. In short—such increases in the incidence of 
cancers are possible upon significant relaxation of natural selection 
through differential mortality.
Overall, cancer is an inheritable noncommunicable disease due to 
its strong genetic background. Cancer genes may be cumulative at the 
reduced natural selection. Natural selection in the past had an ample 
opportunity to eliminate defective genes introduced by mutations 
(Budnik, Liczbińska, & Gumna, 2004; Henneberg, 1976; Henneberg 
& Henneberg, 1998, 2002; Rühli & Henneberg, 2013, 2016; Saniotis 
& Henneberg, 2011, 2012; Stephan & Henneberg, 2001). However, 
natural selection has been significantly reduced in the past 100–
150 years, and the direct consequence of this process is that nearly 
every individual born into a population can pass genes to the next gen-
eration, while some 150 years ago, only 50% or less of individuals had 
this chance (Rühli & Henneberg, 2016; Saniotis & Henneberg, 2012). 
Therefore, population allowing more people with cancer genes survive 
reproduction cycle may boost cancer gene accumulation. For instance, 
genetic predisposition to childhood leukaemia exists (Stieglitz & Loh, 
2013). Patients who survive it will have a chance to pass this predis-
position to the next generation. Similar argument may be made with 
respect to other cancers occurring during prereproductive or repro-
ductive period of life. Currently used cancer treatments are not tar-
geting genetic causes of the disease, but dealing with its phenotypic 
expressions—tumours that are surgically removed, or metastatic cell 
masses whose proliferation is curtailed by chemotherapy and radiation 
therapy. Although successful in a portion of cases, these treatments 
have side effects and do not deal directly with the cause of the dis-
ease, therefore, though undoubtedly helpful to a number of patients, 
they are not optimally effective.
Table 3 showed that country groupings with higher socio- 
economic level had stronger associations between Is and cancer in-
cidence. This finding is consistent with the studies conducted by the 
WHO cancer research agent, IARC (Ferlay et al., 2010, 2013, 2015; 
Jemal et al., 2011). Similarly, reduced natural selection and type 1 di-
abetes prevalence also showed stronger association in developed re-
gions (You & Henneberg, 2016). One of the explanations may be that 
people in developed regions, such as Europe and America have been 
able to access better health services, which has made them to escape 
natural selection more often and pass their detrimental genes onto 
their next generation. The long effect from escaping natural selection 
may allow those genes, including cancer- 
related genes, to accumulate 
in those populations faster (Medawar, 1971; Stephan & Henneberg, 
2001; You & Henneberg, 2016).

YOU and HEnnEBERG
The association between Is and cancer incidence was strong and 
significant in both upper middle and high- 
income economic classifica-
tions (the World Bank). However, it was stronger in upper middle in-
come economic classification. This may be attributable to the fact that 
almost all people in the countries in high- 
income grouping may be able 
to escape natural selection due to high level of health services. This 
is shown by the extremely low Is values of these countries, which are 
close to 0 (Data S1). (ii) Fast developing GDP in upper middle country 
grouping has driven their medicine level to develop quickly, which may 
have made more and more people escape natural selection.
5 | CONCLUSION
Assuming that the increasing genetic load underlies cancer incidence 
as one of the contributing factors, the only way to reduce it remains 
genetic engineering—repair of defective portions of the DNA or their 
blockage by methylation and similar approaches. These techniques, 
though theoretically possible, are not yet practically available. They 
will, however, need to be developed as they provide the only human- 
made alternative to the disappearing action of natural selection as any 
eugenics- 
like approaches are ethically and morally reprehensible.
