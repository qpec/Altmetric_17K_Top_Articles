We completed a 3-arm randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of 2 types of antimicrobial-impregnated clothing compared to
standard HCP clothing. Cultures were obtained from each nurse participant, the healthcare environment, and patients during each shift. The
primary outcome was the change in total contamination on nurse scrubs, measured as the sum of colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria.

Nurse subjects wore standard cotton-polyester surgical scrubs (control), scrubs that contained a complex element

In total, 40 nurses were enrolled and completed 3 shifts. Analyses of 2,919 cultures from the environment and 2,185 from HCP
clothing showed that scrub type was not associated with a change in HCP clothing contamination (P = .70). Mean difference estimates were
0.118 for the Scrub 1 arm (95% confidence interval [CI], −0.206 to 0.441; P = .48) and 0.009 for the Scrub 2 rm (95% CI, −0.323 to 0.342;
P = .96) compared to the control. HCP became newly contaminated with important pathogens during 19 of the 120 shifts (16%).

Approximately 1 in 25 patients contracts a healthcare-associated
infection (HAI) each year in the United States; 75,000 die in the
hospital as a result of their HAI.1 Pathogens that cause HAIs can
spread in the hospital via healthcare providers (HCPs) and/or the
environment.2 The complex interactions involved in pathogen
transmission among patients, HCPs, and the environment are
largely unknown.
Healthcare textiles, including curtains, sheets, and clothing,
are frequently contaminated with epidemiologically important
pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Clos-
tridium difficile.3,4 Clothing of HCPs routinely becomes con-
taminated during clinical duties,5–7 and it may serve as a
source for transmission to patients or recontamination of the
HCP or the environment.

We designed the Antimicrobial Scrub Contamination and
Transmission (ASCOT) Trial (1) to determine whether
antimicrobial-impregnated

decrease
the
burden of HCP clothing contamination compared to standard
surgical scrubs following a 12-hour intensive care unit (ICU)
shift and (2) to characterize the transmission dynamics of
epidemiologically-important pathogens among the patient,
the environment, and the HCP, a group we labeled the
“transmission triangle.”
methods
Study Design and Participants
We performed this blinded, 3-arm, randomized controlled trial
with crossover design in 2 ICUs at Duke University Hospital
between June 15, 2015, and January 10, 2016. The study included
1 control arm and 2 intervention arms. Nurses wore standard
cotton-polyester surgical scrubs in the control arm. In the Scrub 1
intervention arm, nurses wore surgical scrubs that contained a
complex element compound with a silver alloy embedded in its
fibers. In the Scrub 2 intervention arm, nurses wore surgical
scrubs impregnated with an organosilane-based quaternary
ammonium
and
a
hydrophobic
fluoroacrylate
copolymer
emulsion. Nurses participated in each arm during 3 consecutive
12-hour shifts in the ICU. Study personnel laundered all study
scrubs 5 times and delivered them to nurse participants in plastic
bags. Nurses donned the study scrubs at home and presented to
work according to their routines.
In this study, we enrolled nurses from the medical ICU and
surgical ICU at Duke University Hospital, a 936-bed tertiary-care
hospital in Durham, North Carolina, where ICU nurses typically
care for patients in 2 ICU rooms each shift. All nurses working in
the medical ICU or the surgical ICU were eligible for enrollment.
Data from enrolled nurses who failed to complete all 3 shifts were
excluded. Patients known to be colonized or infected with any
multidrug-resistant pathogen were routinely placed on contact
precautions, during which all HCPs wore gowns and gloves upon
entry into the room. These ICUs did not perform routine active
surveillance during the study period.
The Duke University Health System Institutional Review
Board approved the study. Nurses provided written informed
consent. We received a waiver of informed consent to collect
data and specimens from the patients receiving care from
enrolled nurses. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT 02645214).
Randomization and Blinding
After obtaining consent from the nurse subject, the study
coordinator provided the nurse with 3 sets of scrubs. Nurses were
blinded to the type of scrub. Brands and labels were removed from
scrubs; all scrubs were “Duke blue” in color. The study coordinator
provided written and verbal instructions on which scrubs to wear
with each shift. Nurse participants were randomized to 1 of 6
sequences of scrubs (Supplementary Table 1). The nurses wore a
different scrub type during each of the 3 12-hour shifts, so each
nurse participated in each study arm in a 1:1:1 ratio. The study
team was not blinded during specimen and data collection.
However, microbiology personnel were blinded to study arm
allocation during the analysis of specimens.
Procedures
The study coordinator arrived at the ICU prior to the beginning
of each shift to obtain cultures from each nurse’s scrubs (sleeve,
abdomen, and pocket) as well as specified “high touch” surfaces
(bedrail, bed, and supply cart) in each of that nurse’s 2 assigned
rooms (Supplementary Figure 1). The coordinator repeated
the process of obtaining samples from each nurse’s scrubs
and assigned rooms at the end of the nurse’s shift. The study
coordinator also obtained cultures from each patient who received
care from a participating nurse during that shift. Specimens were
collected from the anterior nares, the perirectal area, and from the
integument (i.e., wounds, drains, or axilla). Microbiological
methods are provided in detail in the Supplementary Material.
Cultures from each nurse/patient/room grouping were
analyzed for the presence of similar species. A potential
transmission event or “acquisition” was defined as the new
identification of a target pathogen on nurse clothing, the
patient, or the environment. A confirmed transmission event
or “transmission” was defined as an acquisition event for which
a source from the transmission triangle could be identified
and confirmed. Organisms involved in acquisition events
were analyzed for transmission events using pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE; see Supplementary Material).16
Finally, each nurse completed a 4-question survey at the
end of the shift to describe how the scrubs worn during the
shift compared to their standard work scrubs. Ultimately, each
nurse answered 3 surveys, corresponding with each arm in
the study.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of our study was the change in total
contamination on nurse scrubs, measured as the sum of
colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria identified on nurse
scrubs
from
each

location.
The
following
predetermined secondary outcomes were measured: (1) the
presence or absence of individual target pathogens; (2) the
number and proportion of acquisitions and transmission
events; and (3) HCP perceptions of clothing.
Statistical Analysis
This prospective, blinded, randomized trial was designed
to test the hypothesis that antimicrobial-impregnated scrubs

 would have a smaller increase in total contamination
compared to control scrubs following a single 12-hour shift
in the ICU. Data were summarized using standard statistical
methods, as appropriate.
Power calculations were performed based on 2 primary
assumptions. First, we assumed that the scrubs used in the
control arm would have 2-log increase in total CFU from the
beginning to the end of the shift (SD = 2).12,13 Second, we
assumed a within-nurse, between-shift correlation of 0.5 given
the crossover design of the study. Based on these assumptions,
we found that 40 subjects and 120 (40 subjects × 3 shifts)
repeated measures would provide 90% power to determine a
mean 1-log decrease (SD = 1) in HCP clothing contamination
compared to the control. Power calculations were done with
2-sided significance level of 0.025 for each of the 2 primary
comparisons.
We utilized a generalized estimating equation (GEE) linear
regression model to compare the amount of contamination
(log total CFU) between arms at the end of the shift. The
model included type of scrubs, log total CFU in the beginning
of shift, randomization sequence, patient characteristics (i.e.,
presence of a percutaneous drain, diarrhea, rectal tube present,
or wound; the use of contact precautions; and mechanical
ventilation), and total environmental contamination during
the shift as covariates. An unstructured working correlation
matrix
was
used.

estimates
(compared to control) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were calculated for each intervention arm. The statistical
significance for each of the 2 primary comparisons (each
antimicrobial-impregnated scrub vs control) was corrected
for multiple comparisons, and P < .025 was considered
statistically significant. Responses to nurse questionnaires were
compared using GEE logistic regression with type of scrubs
as a covariate using unstructured working correlation matrix.
We performed all statistical analyses using SAS version 9.4
software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Randomized Controlled Trial Results
In total, 41 nurses were enrolled and randomized for study
participation. We excluded 1 nurse because she failed to complete
all 3 shifts due to illness. A total of 102 unique patients received
care from 40 nurse subjects over 120 individual 12-hour ICU
shifts and 167 patient encounters for an average of 1.4 patients per
nurse per shift. Patients were generally similar across the 3 study
arms (Table 1), though 4 of the patient characteristics were slightly
less common in the Scrub 2 arm.
In total, 2,919 cultures were obtained from the environment
in patient rooms during the 120 shifts. Environmental
contamination was generally similar in the rooms entered by
nurses during each arm, though contamination was highest
during the control arm (Table 2; supplemental Figure 2). Of
the 3 environmental locations tested, bed rails had the highest
amount of contamination, followed by beds and supply carts.
A total of 2,185 cultures were obtained from HCP clothing
during the 120 shifts. Our primary outcome, the increase in
contamination of nurse clothing, was essentially unchanged
across the 3 study arms (Table 3; Supplementary Figure 2).
The median CFU increase was 61.5 (interquartile range [IQR],

2 arm. Nurses’ sleeves and clothing covering their abdomens
showed the greatest increase in contamination during the shift.
Scrub type was not associated with a change in HCP cloth-
ing contamination in multivariable linear regression that
accounted for shift order, nurse crossover/clustering, pre-shift
contamination, patient characteristics, and environmental
contamination (overall P = .70). Mean difference estimates
were 0.118 for the Scrub 1 arm (95% CI, −0.206 to 0.441;
P = .48) and 0.009 for the Scrub 2 arm (95% CI, −0.323 to
0.342; P = .96).
Evaluation of Acquisition and Transmission Events
We identified acquisition events during 39 (33%) of the 120
shifts (Table 4), including 20 (17%) environmental acquisi-
tions and 19 (16%) acquisitions on HCP clothing. Of all
HCP clothing acquisitions, 3 (16%) occurred while caring for
patients on contact precautions. The organisms most com-
monly involved in acquisition events were MSSA (n = 11, 9%),
Acinetobacter (n = 10, 8%), and MRSA (n = 8, 7%). Moreover,
23 of the acquisition events (59%) were confirmed transmis-
sion events from another member of the transmission triangle.
The number of acquisition and transmission events were
generally similar across study arms (Table 4).
Of the 19 HCP clothing acquisition events, 12 (63%) were
confirmed transmission events: 7 from the patient, 3 from
environmental contamination, and 2 from the patient and/or
the environment (i.e., both the patient and environment were
contaminated with target organism during the same shift)
(Figure 1). Of these confirmed transmission events, 1 (8%)
occurred while the patient was on contact precautions. Sta-
phylococcus aureus was involved in the most HCP transmission
events (n = 6: 3 MRSA and 3 MSSA).
Of the 20 environmental acquisition events, 11 (55%) were
confirmed transmission events. All 11 were transmitted from
the patient. We did not identify any MDROs on HCP clothing
at the beginning of a shift. Clothing from 3 HCP (7.5%) were
contaminated with MSSA. No transmissions from HCP-to-
patient or HCP-to-environment were observed. Finally, nurse
perceptions of scrub types are provided in the Supplementary
Material.
discussion
Transmission of microorganisms involves 3 elements: a
source, a susceptible host with a portal of entry receptive to the
agent, and a mode of transmission.17 In the healthcare setting,
these elements culminate in pathogen movement between the
patient, healthcare providers (HCP), and the environment,
known as the “transmission triangle.” When transmission in
this triangle leads to patient acquisition, healthcare-associated
infections (HAIs) can follow.1 Our randomized controlled trial
focused on the use of antimicrobial-impregnated scrubs as a
strategy to decrease pathogen movement in the transmission
triangle. Our results demonstrated that bacterial contamina-
tion of HCP clothing was not decreased when HCPs wore the
antimicrobial-impregnated scrubs used in this study compared
to standard (control) scrubs. We did, however, confirm that
HCP clothing frequently became contaminated during routine
clinical care, and pathogens were frequently acquired from the
patient care environment.
Strategies to decrease pathogen movement in the transmis-
sion triangle can be generally categorized by the points of the
triangle. Interventions can focus on the patient (eg, decoloni-
zation or source control), the environment (eg, enhanced
disinfection, antimicrobial surfaces or textiles), or the health-
care
provider
(eg,
hand
hygiene,
gowns
and
gloves,
antimicrobial-impregnated clothing). Growing evidence sug-
gests that contaminated healthcare textiles may be a source
for transmission of epidemiologically important pathogens
and HAIs.4 Preclinical data suggested that antimicrobial-
impregnated textiles are efficacious at reducing bacterial
burden,8–10 but data to support the use of antimicrobial-
impregnated scrubs in clinical practice are limited. To date,
4 other trials have examined antimicrobial-impregnated
scrubs,

 the HCP (P < .01), but no significant differences were detected
in the amount of VRE or gram-negative bacilli contamination.
In contrast, 3 previously published prospective randomized
trials failed to show significant decreases in bacterial con-
tamination in nurses or ambulance personnel.13–15
Our methods helped provide a more complete analysis of
this technology, as we measured and adjusted for environ-
mental contamination and included important organisms
such as MSSA and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus in our
analyses. In light of these methodological advantages and
the weight of the studies summarized above, we conclude that
antimicrobial-impregnated scrubs are not efficacious at
decreasing the bacterial burden on HCP during a single shift.
We hypothesize that the lack of efficacy in this setting is related
to the low-level disinfectant capabilities of the textiles coupled
with repeated inoculation events and a short time frame
(eg, a shift of 8 to 12 hours) in which to have an effect.
Antimicrobial-impregnated textiles may be more effective
in settings with potentially prolonged exposure and activity,
including curtains and linens.11,18
Our study confirmed that HCP clothing regularly becomes
contaminated with important pathogens6,19,20 and, as a result,
can act as a source for transmission. For example, in a cohort
study of 57 nurses, approximately half of the nurses’ surgical
scrubs became contaminated with VRE, MRSA, and/or
C. difficile by the end of a standard shift.21 Similarly, HCP
clothing contaminated with S. aureus, Acinetobacter spp.,
and/or enterococci is associated with increased risk of
contaminated HCP hands.22 Indeed, HCP clothing can
become contaminated by interacting with either patients or the
environment.23
Patients regularly contaminate their environment,24,25 which
may be the biggest predictor of HCP contamination. Morgan
et al23 analyzed microbiological data from 585 HCP–patient
interactions and concluded that positive environmental cultures
led to a 4-fold increase in the risk of HCP contamination. In our
study, the patient was the source of contamination for all
organisms encountered in the environment. Nurses acquired
important pathogens during 19% of shifts; we confirmed the
source of transmission during 10% of shifts. Importantly, the

NOTE. Acq, acquisition; MSSA, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus; Trans, transmission; VRE,
vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
aAn “acquisition event” was defined as contamination identified at the end of the shift that was not present at the beginning of the shift. A
“transmission event” was defined as an acquisition event for which the source of contamination was identified and confirmed from another
member of the transmission triangle. A nurse or the environment could have more than 1acquisition or transmission event during each shift.
bScrubs contained a complex element compound with embedded silver-alloy.
cScrubs impregnated with an organosilane-based quaternary ammonium and a hydrophobic fluoroacrylate copolymer emulsion.

 environment served as the source of nurse contamination in
25% to 42% of transmission events in our study.
Our study has limitations. First, cultures obtained from
clothing and the environment represented random sampling
from these sites. While the use of replicate organism detection
and counting (RODAC) plates has been validated for use on
textiles,3 the surface area sampled using this technique may have
failed to demonstrate the extent of contamination. Given the
randomized nature of our study, we doubt this impacted our
comparisons. Second, we obtained cultures from 3 patient
locations, and we may have missed patient colonization with
target pathogens in other locations. As a result, we summarized
both acquisitions and confirmed transmissions in our study.
Third, we did not account for pathogen-specific colonization
pressure within participating ICUs in our models. However, this
potential confounder would have had to shift dramatically within
a short period (i.e., 24 hours) to impact our results. Finally, nurse
behavior may have varied between study arms based on personal
or patient-related concerns. We attempted to mitigate this risk
using a crossover design, but we did not observe nurses during
their shifts. Randomization led to equivalent patient numbers in
each study arm.
Contamination of HCPs is an important component of
pathogen transmission in healthcare settings. Results from our
randomized controlled trial demonstrated that antimicrobial-
impregnated scrubs were not efficacious at reducing nurse
contamination and, thus, are not a useful strategy for stopping
the movement of pathogens in the transmission triangle.
We propose that future studies of antimicrobial-impregnated
textiles focus on textiles that have frequent and long-term
contact with patients, such as bed linens and gowns. Finally,
our study demonstrated that the environment is an important
source for HCP clothing contamination. We conclude that
until additional data are available, the best strategies to reduce
the risk of HCP clothing contamination remain diligent hand
hygiene following all patient room entries and exits and, when
appropriate, use of gowns and gloves, even if no direct patient
care is performed.
