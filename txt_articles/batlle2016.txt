Aims: An observational study to determine the safety and efficacy of
filtering surgery employing a microlumen aqueous drainage device
(InnFocus MicroShunt), used intraoperatively with Mitomycin C,
implanted alone or in combination with phacoemulsification.
Materials and Methods: Single-site, prospective, nonrandomized
study of 23 eyes that had failed maximum tolerated glaucoma medi-
cation, followed for 3 years. A MicroShunt was implanted ab externo
through a needle tract under the limbus, draining aqueous from the
anterior chamber to the scleral surface. Prespecified outcome measures
include: intraocular pressure (IOP) control, with and without supple-
mental medication, success rate, medication use, and adverse events.
Results: Fourteen patients received the MicroShunt alone and 9
with cataract surgery. At 1 (n = 23), 2 (n = 22), and 3 (n = 22)
years of follow-up; the qualified success rate (IOPr14 mm Hg and
IOP reduction Z20%) was 100%, 91%, and 95%; mean medi-
cated IOP was reduced from 23.8 ± 5.3 to 10.7 ± 2.8, 11.9 ± 3.7,
and 10.7 ± 3.5 mm Hg, and the mean number of glaucoma medi-
cations/patient was reduced from 2.4 ± 0.9 to 0.3 ± 0.8, 0.4 ± 1.0,
and 0.7 ± 1.1, respectively. The most common complications were
transient hypotony (13%, 3/23) and transient choroidal effusion
(8.7%, 2/23), all resolved spontaneously. There were no leaks,
infections, migrations, erosions, persistent corneal edema, or seri-
ous long-term adverse events.
Conclusion: Surgery with the InnFocus MicroShunt transscleral
aqueous drainage tube with Mitomycin C achieved IOP control in the
low teens in most subjects up to 3 years of follow-up with only tran-
sient adverse events occurring within the first 3 months after surgery.

T
he goals of glaucoma-filtering procedures are to lower
intraocular pressures (IOP) and maintain visual acuity
(VA) while reducing the risk of further glaucomatous visual
field progression and to avoid adverse side effects.1–7 Clin-
ical observations suggest that optimal visual field preser-
vation often requires maintaining IOP in the lower range of
the normal distribution.5 Although trabeculectomy with
intraoperative Mitomycin C (MMC) application often
achieves such a result in primary surgery, skill is required to
achieve the appropriate scleral flap resistance and avoid the
potential complications associated with hypotony.
Our goals and rationales are as follows: (1) to provide
a simple bleb-based procedure that does not require a
scleral flap. We developed a soft, conforming, microlumen
tube (Fig. 1) made from an inert biocompatible biomaterial
called
poly(styrene-block-isobutylene-block-styrene),
or
“SIBS.”8,9 The device is placed through a 3-mm-long 25-G
needle tract formed under the limbus to shunt aqueous
humor from the anterior chamber to the potential space
under Tenon’s capsule. This device obviates the need for
the scleral flap, sclerostomy, iridotomy, and tensioning
sutures used in trabeculectomy. (2) Confirm that (i) the
implant procedure developed in rabbit eye studies is
applicable in human eyes; (ii) that the fins on the microtube
serve as a stopper to prevent aqueous humor from leaking
around the tube; (iii) that the fins tucked in a scleral pocket
prevent device migration; and (iv) that a scleral patch to
prevent erosion of the device through the conjunctiva is
unnecessary. We hypothesize that the soft, conforming
shunt, combined with placement beyond the eyelid excur-
sion will minimize tissue erosion. (3) Yield a predictable
transscleral pressure gradient without relying upon sub-
jective suture tension. The lumen geometry (70 mm dia-
meter, 8.5 mm long) of the MicroShunt acts as a flow
resistor to maintain long-term transscleral pressure above
5 mm Hg; provided that aqueous production is >2 mL/
min.10 (4) Determine the nature of postoperative inter-
ventions and adverse events. The device itself obviates
suture lysis. We expect that the elimination of the scleral
flap, sclerostomy, iridotomy, and tensioning sutures should
reduce scar formation within the bleb and inflammation in
the anterior chamber, which might reduce cataract pro-
gression. The use of a wide and deep fornix-based sub-
conjunctival/Tenon’s flap with the wide placement of MMC
should provide less problematic diffuse blebs.11

 MMC was used in these patients based upon literature
reports of its effectiveness in maintaining successful trabe-
culectomy-based blebs as compared with trabeculectomy
alone.11,12 This device is experimental and at the time of
this writing was not cleared for sale by the FDA but is
approved for a US Investigational Device Exception clin-
ical trial in the USA. It has also received a CE-Mark in
Europe.
The study was conducted at Centro La
´ ser, Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic (21 cases by J.F.B., 2 cases
by R.A.). After approval of the implant protocol (ID 002-
2007) by CONABIOS, the Dominican Republic National
Counsel of Bioethics and Health, the study was initiated on
February 1, 2010. The study is also listed as protocol
NCT00772330 in http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Patients were screened and recruited from the glau-
coma clinic at Centro La
´ ser and the Elı´as Santana Hospital
in Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic). Primary open-
angle glaucoma patients that were not controlled with
maximum tolerated glaucoma medication, demonstrating
glaucomatous neuropathy progression were considered as
potential subjects for the study. Neuropathy progression
was determined by deterioration in visual fields (obtained
by Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer) or in optic disc
changes as estimated in images obtained by OCT (Cirrus;
Zeiss). Likewise, patients who had both cataracts and
glaucoma, where combined cataract and glaucoma proce-
dures were indicated, were also considered for the study. All
patients were carefully instructed about the new device and
the study protocol and all required signing an informed
consent form that was approved by the Dominican
Republic National IRB. The first 23 consecutive patients
who agreed to participate in the study were subsequently
enrolled.
Inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria
are
listed
in Table 1. The baseline examination included measures of
best-corrected VA, visual field, gonioscopy, IOP, slit-lamp
examination of the anterior chamber, and optic disc and
fundus examination.
The criteria for “complete success” and “qualified
success” were adopted from the Tube versus Trabeculec-
tomy (TVT) Study.13–15 Complete success requires all of the
following: (1) IOPr21 mm Hg; (2) IOP reduction from
baseline of Z20%; (3) no reoperation for glaucoma
(defined as requiring a procedure in an operating room); (4)
no loss of light perception vision; (5) no chronic hypotony
defined as IOPr5 mm Hg on 2 consecutive follow-up visits
after 3 months; and (6) no use of supplemental glaucoma
medication. (Needling of the bleb or postsurgical injection
of an antifibrotic is not considered failures unless per-
formed in an operating room setting.) Qualified success is
the same as “complete success,” but with use of supple-
mental glaucoma medication. Qualified success with the
same criteria as above, except with IOPr18, 16, 15, 14, and
12 mm Hg will also be reported.
A masked observer measured IOP using the Gold-
mann applanation tonometry technique.13 The IOP was
measured at baseline while patients were self-administering
their habitual glaucoma medications. Glaucoma medi-
cations were discontinued immediately after surgery and
were introduced at the surgeon’s discretion if the IOP was
not adequately controlled.
The MicroShunt was provided by InnFocus Inc. (Miami,
FL) in a sterile packaged kit containing: (1) three 7mm dia-
meter, 1-mm thick, polyvinyl alcohol LASIK shields (Hurri-
cane Medical Inc., Bradenton, FL); (2) a gentian violet marker
pen (Hurricane Medical Inc.); (3) a 3-mm marker/ruler (cus-
tom made by InnFocus Inc.); (4) a flat 1mm wide�1mm long
Mani angled knife blade (Mani ophthalmic knife, MSL10 Slit
Angled 1.0mm; Mani Inc., Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan); and
(5) a 25- or 27-G needle (Precision Glide Needle; Becton &
Dickinson & Co, Franklin Lakes). Lidocaine with epinephrine
was from Ropsohn, Bogota
´ , Colombia. Intracameral lido-
caine was from Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL. The bipolar
diathermy unit was from Radionic by Mentor, Model 440E,
Santa Barbara, CA.
Phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) inser-
tion, if required, was performed first with suturing of the
clear corneal incision. The MicroShunt was implanted as
illustrated in Figure 2. (1) A mixture of 0.1 mL of 0.1%
lidocaine and 0.1 mL of 0.5% epinephrine was injected (30-
G needle) under the conjunctiva and the conjunctival ele-
vated to include 2 quadrants. Intracameral lidocaine (0.1 to

 0.5 mL) was injected through a temporal corneal para-
centesis tract. (2) A 6- to 8-mm-wide incision was made
through the insertions of the conjunctiva and Tenon’s
capsule at the corneoscleral junction in the superior tem-
poral quadrant to form a fornix-based subconjunctival/
Tenon’s flap. The flap was dissected posteriorly with blunt-
tipped scissors to approximately the equator and laterally 3
to 4 mm on each side of the incision. Hemostasis was ach-
ieved with bipolar diathermy. (3) Three LASIK shields
saturated in 0.4 mg/mL MMC were placed in the flap for
3 minutes (
± 15 s) followed by irrigation with sterile saline
solution (
>25 mL). (4) A point on the sclera was marked
3 mm posterior to the limbus with the inked marker/ruler
and a radial, shallow scleral pocket, approximately 1 mm
wide�1 mm in length, triangular pocket was made at the
marked point with the Mani knife. (5) A 25- or 27-G needle
was advanced through the apex of the scleral pocket into
the anterior chamber above the iris plane. The course of the
drainage tube approximately bisected the angle that was
formed between the iris and cornea. (6) The MicroShunt
was maneuvered through the scleral pocket and needle tract
with a forceps and the fins of the device wedged snugly into
the scleral pocket. The proximal end of the shunt extended
2 to 3 mm into the anterior chamber. (7) Flow of aqueous
humor was confirmed by observing drop formation at the
distal end of the tube. (8) The distal end of the device was
tucked under the subconjunctival Tenon’s capsule flap to lie
flush with the sclera, and the flap closed with multiple
interrupted 10 to 0 nylon sutures on a spatula needle.
A light-pressure patch was used the day after surgery
and nightly for 5 days thereafter. Topical Tobradex (Alcon
Laboratories Inc, Fort Worth, TX), or Zymar and Predsol
Forte (both from Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA) were instilled
for 3 weeks or until the anterior chamber reaction and
conjunctival hyperemia had resolved.
Subjects were examined at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3
months, 6 months, and at 1, 2, and 3 years for protocol-
based examinations. Best-corrected VA, IOP, slit-lamp
examination
including
gonioscopy
and
fundus
were
assessed at each visit and visual fields annually. Anterior
chamber and bleb slit-lamp photography was performed at
1, 3, 6 months, and annually. Blebs were rated annually
using the Indiana Bleb Appearance Grading Scale.16
RESULTS
Baseline demographic characteristics are described
in Table 2. Postoperative data were available for 23 patients
at 1 year and 22 patients thereafter as 1 patient was lost to
follow-up.
Fourteen
patients
underwent
MicroShunt
implantation alone and 9 underwent combined MicroShunt
insertion and phacoemulsification with subsequent IOL
implantation. All patients presented with open-angle glau-
coma with angles >30 degrees as determined by gonioscopy.
The first 20 insertions of the MicroShunt were per-
formed successfully with the needle tract formed with the
27-G needle. However, the surgeon suggested that insertion
of the MicroShunt could be facilitated if a larger 25-G
needle was used for this purpose. The last 3 cases were
performed with the 25-G needle and the insertion was
indeed found to be easier and quicker with no observable
periannular leakage. The MicroShunt was implanted suc-
cessfully in all cases, thereby confirming that the procedure
established in rabbit eyes can be reproduced in human eyes.
Flow through the tube was observed after implantation,
and there were no observable leaks around the tube. No
device migration or erosion occurred throughout the 3-year
study.
The mean percent reduction in IOP from baseline
(23.8 ± 5.3 mm Hg) at 1, 2, and 3 years was 55%, 50%, and
FIGURE 2. Schematic of implantation procedure: (1) inject anesthesia under the conjunctiva. (2) Make a fornix-based subconjunctival/
Tenon’s flap. (3) Place 3 Mitomycin C-soaked sponges in flap. Remove and rinse with sterile saline solution. (4) Form a radial, shallow
scleral pocket with the Mani knife. (5) Form a needle tract connecting the pocket to the anterior chamber at the angle. (6) Thread the
MicroShunt through the scleral pocket and needle tract with a forceps and wedge the fins of the device snugly into the scleral pocket.
(7) Confirm flow of aqueous humor through the MicroShunt. (8) Tuck the distal end of the device under Tenon’s capsule and close the
flap with multiple interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures.

 55%, respectively (Fig. 3). The mean IOP were 10.7 ± 2.8,
11.9 ± 3.7, and 10.7 ± 3.5 mm Hg, respectively.
The number and percent of patients at various IOP
intervals (
r21, 18, 14, etc.) at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 years are
reported in the upper section of Table 3. At 0.5, 1, 2, and 3
years there were 0, 0, 2, and 1 eye, respectively, with IOP
reduction from baseline <20%; that is, only 3 of the 23
eyes in the study did not demonstrate a reduction in IOP
from baseline of Z20%. The IOP for the 2 patients at 2
years with IOP reduction from baseline <20% were 18 and
19 mm Hg, respectively. The 1 patient at 3 years with IOP
reduction from baseline <20% had an IOP of 15.5 mm Hg.
The data in the lower section of Table 3 combine the IOP
from the upper section of Table 3 with the 3 failures where
IOP was not reduced Z20%. Therefore, for example,
reading from Table 3 (lower), if the qualified success rate
was defined as IOPr14 mm Hg and Z20% reduction in
IOP from baseline, the result would be 100%, 100, 91%,
and 95% at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The reason
for the increased qualified success rate from 2 to 3 years
is due to one of the failed cases being placed back on
glaucoma medication.
One operation failed at 27 months due to the for-
mation of an encapsulated bleb and an IOP that could not
be controlled with medication. The patient underwent
reoperation with a second MicroShunt, with the first device
remaining in place. The IOP at the time of this writing with
the second shunt is 12.5 mm Hg. This patient was consid-
ered a failure and the data not censored from the study.
Two patients had elevated IOP in the immediate
postoperative period. In 1 combined surgery case, elevated
IOP on day 1 was likely due to fibrin that was observed to
block the MicroShunt lumen. The surgeon used a 27-G
needle
to
perform
an
anterior
chamber
paracentesis
through a clear cornea incision to flush the debris from the
lumen and the IOP was thereafter controlled. In the second
case, the surgeon used a 25-G needle to perforate an
encysted bleb on postoperative day 90 when the pressure
rose to 34 mm Hg, after which the IOP was controlled. Both
of these interventions were considered serious adverse
events.
The change in glaucoma medication use and the per-
cent of patients off medication are reported in Table 4. The
Kaplan-Meier survival curves showing both the complete
and qualified success rates are presented in Figure 4.

 Blebs and anterior chambers for tube placement were
photographed and later rated according to the Indiana Bleb
Appearance Grading Scale by a masked reviewer (P.P.).16
The average rated height, area, and vascularity at year 2
(n = 23) of the blebs were H2.0 ± 0.6 (range, 1 to 3),
A2.5 ± 1.0 (range, 1 to 4), and V1.3 ± 0.5 (range, 1 to 2),
respectively. The average rated height, area, and vascularity
at year 3 (n = 22) of the blebs were H1.0 ± 0.7 (range, 0 to
2), A0.8 ± 0.7 (range, 0 to 2), and V2.0 ± 1.2 (range, 0 to
3), respectively. Figure 5 shows a typical bleb progression at
1, 2, and 3 years. No tubes were observed to be in contact
with the corneal endothelium, and no focal corneal opac-
ities were noted.
Filtering blebs were observed at the slit lamp in 21 of 23
eyes at 1 year. Two of the 23 eyes had no discernible bleb;
however, the IOP was controlled. At 3 years, 3 more patients
(5 in total) were observed to have no discernable bleb, also
with IOP controlled. None of the flat blebs had angle closure
by Van Herick or gonioscopic examination. One patient had
an early bleb leak that spontaneously resolved within 2
weeks. No late bleb leaks were observed, and there were no
cases of bleb infection. In addition, there was no observed
“tenting” of the conjunctiva over the MicroShunt in eyes
with blebs. In eyes with flat blebs, the outline of the
MicroShunt could be discerned under the Tenon’s; however,
the MicroShunt tended to remain flat on the scleral surface
in all cases as opposed to lifting from the sclera.
There were no VA losses or gains >1 line in any of the
patients who had glaucoma surgery alone over the 3-year
timeframe tested. There were 3 patients who gained 2
or more lines at 1 and 3 years, and 4 patients at 2 years,
after implantation of a MicroShunt in combination with
phacoemulsification and implantation of an IOL.
A summary of 21 postpostoperative adverse events
directly related to the MicroShunt are presented in Table 5. Of
these 21 adverse events, 14 patients experienced no adverse
events. Two of the 7 patients with adverse events endured
multiple adverse events which included hypotony, shallow
anterior chamber, iris touch, and choroidal detachment.
Shallow anterior chambers were observed in 3/23
(13.0%) patients, 1 from the device only group and 2 from
the combined group and occurred during the first 3 weeks
after surgery. All were managed expectantly without secon-
dary procedures or special maneuvers. Atropine, viscoelastic,
and patching were not used in any of these cases. There were
no bleb leaks. One of the combined cases presented with
their intraocular lens captured in the pupil but with an
excellent bleb and good VA. The IOL was repositioned in a

 subsequent intervention. No patient required reformation of
the anterior chamber or drainage of a choroidal effusion.
One shallow anterior chamber spontaneously deepened to
normal depth by 14 days and the other 2 resolved sponta-
neously by the day 21 of the follow-up. There were no
associated adverse events such as cataract formation, corneal
edema, or development of peripheral anterior synechiae
from these 3 patients with shallow chambers.
Choroidal detachment was observed in 2 patients
(8.7%) from the combined group and were documented by
indirect ophthalmoscopy and in some cases by B-ultra-
sound. In 1 patient with transient hypotony, who also
experienced a shallow chamber, the IOP returned to 6 mm
Hg by the 6-week follow-up and the detachment resolved
spontaneously by the 12-week follow-up. In the second
patient, the IOP dropped to 6 mm Hg at the 3-week follow-
up and increased to 8 mm Hg at 6 weeks, at which time the
choroidal detachment had resolved spontaneously. Topical
steroids and antibiotics were used in these patients—oral
steroids were not used. There were no cases of chronic
hypotony, late bleb leak, endophthalmitis, or cataract
progression in these 2 patients.
Adverse events related to cataract surgery included;
transient corneal edema (4 patients), posterior capsular
opacities (2 patients) which were successfully treated with a
Nd:YAG laser and posterior synechiae (2 patients). Intra-
ocular lens pupillary capture (1 patient) was corrected by
repositioning. Vitreous hemorrhage resolved on its own in 1
patient and fibrin in the aqueous resolved in another patient
on its own. Other individual adverse events included tear-
ing, dry eye, and pain.
DISCUSSION
This small nonrandomized observational study was
designed to confirm the implant procedure in humans and
to gather some information on the long-term safety and
efficacy of the device. The average IOP at 3 years was
10.7 ± 3.5 mm Hg with a reduction in IOP from baseline
of 53% and was similar in patients undergoing device
implantation alone or device implantation combined with
phacoemulsification and IOL implantation. These data are
similar to those reported for bleb-based procedures with
MMC; that is, primary trabeculectomy alone and primary
trabeculectomy with the Ex-Press Shunt (Alcon Labo-
ratories Inc., Optonol, Fort Worth, TX),12–15,17–19 with
1-year mean IOP varying within a range of 11 to 15 mm Hg.
Over 80% of the patients in this study have an
IOPr14 mm Hg (Table 3) which suggests sufficient IOP
lowering to limit vision loss based upon data from the
AGIS study.5 Two thirds of the patients did not require
glaucoma medication at the third year of the study and the
overall mean reduction in glaucoma medication was 71%
to 0.7 ± 1.1 medications/patient (Table 4) at 3 years.
Bleb appearance trended toward shrinkage in volume
(decreased height and decreased area) and increased vas-
cularity with time. The IOP remained in the low teens in the
5 patients at 3 years with flat blebs, suggesting that drainage
from these blebs was occurring, possibly through lymphatic
channels in the area of the bleb.

 The adverse events observed in this study are either
comparable to or less than those observed in other surgical
procedures and devices reported in the literature.12–15,17–20
The failure rate and need for supplemental medication seem
favorable in comparison to trabeculectomy with MMC. In
contrast to results for tube-to-plate aqueous drainage
implants, no cases of persistent corneal edema or of motility
disturbance were observed.14,15,20
The initial safety profile of the MicroShunt may have
advantages over trabeculectomy in that patients did not
demonstrate hypotony-related complications that required
surgical intervention. The incidence of transient hypotony
observed in this study was in the range of that reported by
various investigators with the Ex-Press shunt (7.5% to
15.6%) and with trabeculectomy (8% to 32%).12–15,17–19
The incidence of combined shallow anterior chambers and
choroidal effusions reported by Netland et al19 was 6.8%
and 11.5% in the Ex-Press and trabeculectomy groups,
respectively. The small lumen diameter and long length of
the rubbery tube, combined with sealing of the peritubular
space with the fins of the device, prevents sudden changes
from occurring in aqueous humor volume in the eye which
may play a role in limiting choroidal hemorrhage and other
severe adverse sequelae.
No cases of late tube-corneal touch, migration, or
erosion were observed in this study. The lack of tube
exposure may be due to use of a 3-mm-long scleral needle
track with surfacing of the tube above the scleral surface
behind the excursion of the upper eyelid. Placement of the
tube in this manner has been shown to markedly reduce
tube erosions for Ahmed implants, as described by Albis-
Donato et al.21 These results suggest that use of covering
patch material, such as sclera, cornea, pericardium, or
amniotic membrane is unnecessary with this device.
To summarize relative to the goals outlined in the
introduction: (1) the InnFocus MicroShunt is simple to
implant, without the need for scleral dissection, scle-
rostomy, iridotomy, and tensioning sutures. With practice,
the procedural time was reduced to <12 minutes. Although
not explored in this study, we believe that the procedure can
be performed <9 minutes if MMC were injected before
surgery. (2) The MicroShunt was implanted successfully in
all cases, thereby confirming that the procedure established
in rabbit eyes can be reproduced in human eyes. The
establishment of flow through the device at the end of the
procedure, as determined by observing drop formation at
the exit of the device, suggests that the tube and fins
effectively sealed the needle tract (flow would not occur
through the small lumen of the device if there was sub-
stantial periannular leakage). There were no observations
of device migration or erosion through the conjunctiva
throughout the 3-year study, thereby confirming that a
scleral patch is not required. (3) IOP is controlled in the
long term. Although there was some acute hypotony, all
resolved spontaneously without intervention. Early hypot-
ony was expected until the effect on aqueous flow of prior
medical therapy abated. The device was effective in low-
ering IOP by 50% to 55%, with control of IOP to a level
<14 mm Hg in over 80% of patients. (4) Postoperative
intervention included only 1 bleb needling and 1 failure
over the 3-year study. Suture lysis was eliminated and there
were no incidences of late bleb leaks, endophthalmitis, or
any other long-term sight-threatening adverse events. There
was no noted progression of cataracts in any of the phakic
patients.
This observational study was conducted on a small
number (23) of patients and was not powered or randomized
to provide conclusive results on its effectiveness in relation to
more conventional procedures such as trabeculectomy.
However, the data did provide a level of confidence to pro-
ceed to larger controlled studies. The InnFocus MicroShunt
was CE Marked on January 9, 2012 in Europe where several
other clinical studies are under way to increase the number of
patients followed and to find the limitations of the device. In
addition, a US Investigational Device Exception was granted
by the FDA in May 2013 and a multicenter clinical trial
comparing the MicroShunt to primary trabeculectomy in
patients refractory to medication is under way.
