outcomes, despite substantial differences in sample com-
position and treatment settings. The present study confirms 
prior clinical results and lends further support to the viabil-
ity of CGRI in the treatment of PD.

Introduction
Hyperventilation and other respiratory abnormalities play 
a significant role in the etiology or maintenance of panic 
disorder (PD) (Klein 1993; Ley 1985). Patients with PD 
show lower end-tidal (exhaled)  
CO2  
(PETCO2), a marker of 
hyperventilation, compared to anxious or healthy controls 
(Meuret et al. 2008; Wilhelm et al. 2001). The acute effects 
of hyperventilation and compensatory mechanisms include 
many physiological sensations that are consistent with 
those seen in anxiety and panic, including gastrointestinal 
Abstract Panic disorder (PD) is associated with hyper-
ventilation. The efficacy of a brief respiratory feedback 
program for PD has been established. The aim of the pre-
sent study was to expand these results by testing a simi-
lar program with more clinically representative patients 
and settings. Sixty-nine adults with PD received 4 weeks 
of Capnometry Guided Respiratory Intervention (CGRI) 
using Freespira, which provides feedback of end-tidal  
CO2 
 
(PETCO2) and respiration rate (RR), in four non-academic 
clinical settings. This intervention is delivered via home 
use following initial training by a clinician and provides 
remote monitoring of client adherence and progress by 
the clinician. Outcomes were assessed post-treatment and 
at 2- and 12-month follow-up. CGRI was associated with 
an intent-to-treat response rate of 83% and a remission 
rate of 54%, and large decreases in panic severity. Simi-
lar decreases were found in functional impairment and in 
global illness severity. Gains were largely sustained at fol-
low-up.  
PETCO2 moved from the slightly hypocapnic range 
to the normocapnic range. Benchmarking analyses against

distress, cold sensations, fatigue, rapid or irregular heart-
beat, chest pain, impaired breathing, muscle tension, and 
paresthesias.
Meuret et al. (2008) reported outcomes from capnome-
try-assisted respiratory training (CART), which measured 
and provided feedback on  
PETCO2 over 4 weeks. Sustained 
increases in  
PETCO2 levels and significant reduction in 
panic symptom severity and frequency were documented.
(Meuret et al. 2009) More recently, Meuret et al. (2010) 
found that panic symptom severity improved significantly 
and equally with CART and cognitive therapy.
The aim of the present study was to replicate and extend 
the findings of Meuret et al. (2008) using a novel system, 
and to benchmark the effectiveness of Capnometry Guided 
Respiratory Intervention (CGRI) in a clinically representa-
tive sample of PD patients seeking treatment in naturalis-
tic clinical settings vs. the academic centers where prior 
CART studies were performed.
Methods
Participants
Participants were recruited from four geographically 
diverse non-academic outpatient clinics. Eligible partici-
pants had a primary diagnosis of PD, were 18–65 years old, 
were rated as “moderately ill” or greater on the Clinician 
Global Impression Scale, and were either off medications 
or had been stable on medications for at least 3 months. 
Participants were ineligible if they were pregnant; currently 
or recently enrolled in another device or drug study; cur-
rently receiving other psychological treatment; had been 
unresponsive to cognitive-behavioral therapy or BR within 
the past 3 months; or had evidence of organic mental dis-
order, severe suicidality, psychotic disorder, substance 
dependence, uncontrolled cardiovascular or pulmonary dis-
ease, or seizures. A diagram of participant flow is shown in 
Fig. 1.
Measures
Diagnoses were determined using the Mini International 
Diagnostic Interview (MINI) (Sheehan et al. 1998). The 
primary outcome measure was the clinician-rated Panic 
Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) (Shear et al. 1997). Sec-
ondary outcome measures were the Clinician Global 
Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S) (Guy 1976), using spe-
cific anchor points developed for patients with panic disor-
der (Pollack et al. 2003), and the Sheehan Disability Scale 
(Leon et al. 1992). Patient Satisfaction was assessed with 
the question “How likely would you be to recommend this 
treatment to a friend or family member?”; responses were 
scored from 0 (“would not recommend”) to 4 (“would 
definitely recommend”). Panic Attack frequency over the 
past week was collected via case report form at each visit. 
 
PETCO2 and RR levels were examined by calculating (1) 
the average baseline-stage  
PETCO2 from the first “at home” 
treatment session; (2) the average baseline-stage  
PETCO2 
from the last treatment session; and (3) the average base-
line-stage  
PETCO2 from the 2- and 12-month follow-up vis-
its. At each visit, clinicians completed a record of Adverse 
Reactions/Adverse Events (AR/AE)s, scored from 0 (No

significant functional impairment) to 5 (Significant func-
tional impairment). For benchmarking purposes, we also 
included the following outcome measures that were used in 
the Meuret et al. (2008) RCT: the Anxiety Sensitivity Index 
(ASI) (Reiss et al. 1986), the Mobility Inventory for Ago-
raphobia (MI-AAL) (Chambless et al. 1985), and the Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck et al. 1961).
Apparatus
Capnometry Guided Respiratory Intervention (CGRI) was 
conducted using Freespira (Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc., 
Danville, CA) which consists of a  
CO2 sensor, a Nexus 7 
tablet with the Freespira Mobile App, and a nasal cannula. 
The  
CO2 sensor transmits the  
PETCO2 and respiration rate 
(RR) values to the tablet, where the app displays the values 
and instructs the patient visually and audibly how to pro-
ceed during the breathing exercises. Data from each treat-
ment session is immediately streamed via the Nexus tablet 
to a secure server, which allows compilation of aggregate 
data as well as client-by-client and session-by-session 
review of adherence and progress. We previously found 
excellent test–retest reliability in a sample of 11 healthy 
nonsmokers for RR (r = 0.90) and  
PETCO2 (r = 0.93).
Procedure
After providing informed consent, participants completed 
the pre-treatment measures and met with a study clini-
cian for assessment. CGRI was conducted over 4 weeks. 
Patients were instructed to perform breathing sessions 
twice each day at home. Breathing sessions were 17 min 
long and consisted of a baseline stage during which the 
patient sits quietly and relaxed with eyes closed (2 min), 
a pacing stage during which the patient monitors  
PETCO2 
level and RR while breathing with tones at a specified rate 
(10 min), and a transition stage during which the patient 
maintains breathing pattern without the tones but with con-
tinued  
PETCO2 and RR feedback (5 min). For the pacing 
stage, the tones were set by the therapist for 13, 11, 9 or 6 
breaths per minute, representing each progressive week of 
the program. The mobile app showed patients their current 
 
PETCO2 level, target  
PETCO2 level (37–40 mm Hg), current 
RR, and target RR (varying by week).
Participants had four weekly visits with a study thera-
pist to review progress, ask questions, and address any 
concerns. No other therapeutic activities were conducted. 
Participants completed the study measures again at mid-
treatment and post-treatment. At the end of treatment, 
participants returned the device and were given no fur-
ther instructions or contact with research staff. They then 
returned for follow-up assessment and extended baseline 
 
PETCO2 monitoring sessions at 2- and 12-month follow-up, 
as well as a telephone questionnaire regarding panic attacks 
at 6-month follow-up.
Data Analytic Plan
For patients with at least one post-treatment data point, 
PDSS, SDS and CGI-S scores at post-treatment and at 2 
and 12-month follow-up were estimated based on previ-
ous values using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. 
The imputation was repeated five times. The corresponding 
statistical method was applied to each of the five imputed 
data sets and results were averaged across imputed data 
sets appropriately accounting for the between and within 
imputed data set variances.
Response was defined as a 40% or greater reduction in 
scores on the PDSS; remission was defined as a score of 
five or less on the PDSS (Furukawa et al. 2009). Propor-
tions of participants with the desired outcome and associ-
ated 95% lower bounds were estimated. The proportions 
were also compared to 50% using a one-sided Wald test. 
For the continuous outcomes (change from pre-treatment 
on PDSS, SDS and CGI-S) the mean score was estimated, 
95% lower bound was calculated and Cohen’s d’ within-
group effect sizes were calculated.
Moderator analyses were conducted, with change in 
clinical measures from pre-treatment used as the dependent 
variable and the potential moderator (hypocapnia defined 
as baseline-stage  
PETCO2 < 37 vs. normocapnic defined as 
 
PETCO2 ≥ 37) as a predictor. Means, SDs, 95% CIs, and 
Cohen’s d’ effect sizes within each group were calculated. 
Cohen’s d effect sizes for change from pre-treatment in the 
two groups were also calculated.
Benchmarking analyses were conducted by comparing 
the present data to those of the CART group in the Meuret 
et al. (2008) study. Pre-treatment variables were compared 
between the two studies using Cohen’s d for continuous 
variable and odds ratios (OR) for categorical variables. 
Changes from pre- to post-treatment in each study were 
compared using Cohen’s d.
Results
Sample Description
As shown in Table 1, participants had a mean age of 37 
years. Just over half the sample was female, and one quar-
ter was nonwhite. At pre-treatment, PD severity was in the 
moderate range. The average participant was rated as mod-
erately ill on the CGI, and reported moderate overall func-
tional impairment on the SDS. Mean pre-treatment  
PETCO2 
levels were mildly hypocapnic. Compared to Meuret et al.’s 
(2008) sample, the present participants were more likely to 
 54

be male, five times more likely to be African-American or 
Hispanic, over three times more likely to be taking antide-
pressant or benzodiazepine medications, and more likely 
to meet criteria for comorbid major depressive disorder. 
Although PD severity was identical, the present sample 
reported markedly higher levels of disability, as well as 
somewhat higher levels of agoraphobic avoidance. The pre-
sent sample was also less hypocapnic.
Attrition
Among those who started CGRI, 20% dropped out dur-
ing the course of treatment. The most common stated 
reason (n = 7) was inability or unwillingness to meet the 
time commitment of the study. One participant cited lack 
of perceived efficacy, and another cited adverse effects. 
The remainder were lost to contact with no explanation 
given. Another 20 were lost after treatment but before one 
of the post-treatment or follow-up assessments, with no 
explanation given. Participants who did and did not com-
plete the treatment did not differ significantly in terms of 
age, gender, duration of illness, panic severity, agorapho-
bic avoidance, anxiety sensitivity, depression, functional 
impairment, global illness severity, or prevalence of comor-
bid major depressive disorder (all ps > 0.05).
Adherence
Treatment adherence was calculated by determining the 
proportion of CGRI sessions completed over the course of 
the study (target = 56), as evidenced by automatic uploads 
to a cloud-based server. Because some patients had com-
pleted more than the required number of respiratory ses-
sions, we coded all patients who completed 56 or more 
sessions as 100% compliant; for all others, we calculated 
adherence as the number of completed sessions divided 
by 56. The average adherence using this calculation was 
84.1% (SD = 18%).
Outcome of CGRI on Panic Disorder Severity
The proportion of responders at post-treatment was 
85.4% (SE = 5.1%) in treatment completers, and 83.2% 
(SE = 5.3%) in the intent to treat (ITT) sample. The rate of 
remission was 56.3% (SE = 7.2%) in treatment completers, 
and 54.4% (SE = 6.8%) in the ITT sample. As shown in 
Table 2, average PDSS decrease from pre-treatment in

completers was significant, with a large effect size. Panic 
severity decreased from the “markedly ill” range to the 
“slightly ill” range. Thirty-four (70.8%) of the 48 treatment 
completers reported experiencing no panic attacks in the 
past week.
At 2-month follow-up, the proportion of responders was 
71.1% (SE = 6.8%) in treatment completers, and 71.8% 
(SE = 5.6%) in the ITT sample. The rate of remission was 
53.3% (SE = 7.4%) in treatment completers and 52.9% 
(SE = 6.4%) in the ITT sample. Average PDSS decrease 
from pre-treatment was significant, with a large effect size 
in completers and in the ITT sample. Thirty-three (71.7%) 
of the 46 follow-up completers reported experiencing no 
panic attacks in the past week.
At 12-month follow-up, the proportion of responders 
was 81.8% (SE = 6.7%) in treatment completers, and 76.5% 
(SE = 5.7%) in the ITT sample. The rate of remission 
was 69.7% (SE = 8%) in treatment completers, and 59.4% 
(SE = 7.3%) in the ITT sample. Average PDSS decrease 
from pre-treatment was significant, with a large effect size 
in treatment completers and in the ITT sample. Twenty-six 
(78.8%) of the 33 follow-up completers reported experienc-
ing no panic attacks in the past week.
Outcome of CGRI on Secondary Outcome Measures
As shown in Table 2, CGI-S, SDS, and number of panic 
attacks showed significant and substantial decreases at post-
treatment, with large effect sizes in treatment completers 
and in the ITT sample. CGI-S scores decreased from the 
moderate range to the borderline to mild range. SDS scores 
decreased from the moderate range to the mild range. At 
two-month follow-up, CGI-S and SDS continued to show 
significant decreases from pre-treatment, with large effect 
sizes for treatment completers and in the ITT sample. 
Interestingly, SDS scores decreased even further over the 
follow-up period. Number of panic attacks per week mod-
erately decreased from pre-treatment in treatment com-
pleters and in the ITT sample. At 6-month follow-up, the 
number of panic attacks was substantially decreased from 
pre-treatment for treatment completers and the ITT sam-
ple. At 12-month follow-up, CGI-S and SDS continued to 
show significant decreases from pre-treatment, with large 
effect sizes for treatment completers and the ITT sample. 
SDS scores were in the mild range of impairment. Number 
of panic attacks per week were moderately decreased from 
pre-treatment.
Outcome of CGRI on Respiratory Parameters
As shown in Table 2, average increase in baseline-stage 
 
PETCO2 from first “at-home” treatment to last treatment 
was significant, with a large effect size in both treatment 
completers and the ITT sample.  
PETCO2 levels increased 
from the mildly hypocapnic range to the normocapnic 
range. Average decrease in baseline-stage RR from first 
“at-home” treatment to last treatment was significant, 
with a moderate effect size in treatment completers and

the ITT sample. RR decreased from the middle of the 
normal range to the lower end of the normal range.
At two-month follow-up, average increase in in base-
line-stage  
PETCO2 from first “at-home” treatment was 
significant, with a moderate effect size in treatment com-
pleters and the ITT sample. The corresponding aver-
age decrease in baseline-stage RR was significant, with 
a large effect size in treatment completers and the ITT 
sample.
At 12-month follow-up, average increase in  
PETCO2 
from first “at-home” treatment was significant with 
a medium effect size in treatment completers and the 
ITT sample. The corresponding average baseline-stage 
decrease in RR was significant with a large effect size in 
treatment completers and a medium effect size in the ITT 
sample.
Moderator Analysis
The 62 patients who completed at least one breathing 
assignment were split between 39 hypocapnic and 23 nor-
mocapnic participants based on  
PETCO2 values from their 
first “at-home” session. In a completer analysis of PDSS 
reduction during treatment and follow-up, the hypocap-
nic and normocapnic groups did not differ significantly at 
post-treatment (t46 = 1.2, p = 0.2, d = 0.4) but differed sig-
nificantly at 2-month follow-up (t43 = 2.5, p = 0.02, d = 0.8); 
Mean PDSS decrease for hypocapnic patients was 9.9 
(SD = 8.1); for normocapnic patients it was 6.2 (SD = 3.5). 
At 12-month follow-up the difference was again not sig-
nificant (t43 = 0.5, p = 0.6, d = 0.2). A moderating effect 
of pre-treatment hypocapnia on change in  
PETCO2 from 
pre-treatment was found; this difference was significant at 
post-treatment and at 2-month follow-up, and marginal at 
12-month follow-up (post-treatment: t45 = 2.8, p = 0.007, 
d = 0.9; 2-month follow-up: t42 = 2.6, p = 0.01, d = 0.9; 
12-month follow-up: t26 = 2.1, p = 0.05, d = 0.9) The 
increase in  
PETCO2 was greater for hypocapnic participants 
than for normocapnic participants. Results for the ITT sam-
ple were very similar.
Patient Satisfaction
At post-treatment, the mean response to the question 
“How likely would you be to recommend this treatment to 
a friend or family member?” (0–4) was 3.50 (SD = 0.77), 
with 88% responding positively (score 3 or 4). At 2-month 
follow-up, the mean response was 3.53 (SD = 0.73), with 
87% responding positively; at 12-month follow-up the 
mean response was 3.33 (SD = 0.82) with 82% responding 
positively.
Adverse Events
There were no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). The overall 
rate of moderate-to-severe dizziness (score 3–5) for all vis-
its was 2% (6 reports from 319 patient visits). For moder-
ate-to-severe lightheadedness the rate was also 2% (7/319). 
The highest rates of moderate-to-severe dizziness or light-
headedness were seen in the first treatment visit: 4% for 
dizziness (2 reports from 56 first visits) and 7% for light-
headedness 4/56). One patient reported significant func-
tional impairment due to dizziness (score = 5) after visit 2. 
Another patient reported significant functional impairment 
(score = 5) due to lightheadedness after visit 1. There were 
no reports of moderate-to-severe dizziness or lightheaded-
ness after visit 4. Reported “Other” AR/AEs included nau-
sea (3), fatigue (1), tingling in hands, mouth or ears (2), 
shakiness (1) and dry mouth (1). Three panic attacks dur-
ing sessions were reported. None of these “Other” AR/AEs 
resulted in significant impairment and all ceased once the 
session was completed.
Benchmarking Outcomes
Table 3 shows results of the present sample vs. those in 
Meuret et al.’s (2008) CART study. Because there was 
no attrition in the Meuret study, the treatment completer 
and ITT outcomes are the same. We used our completer 
analyses in order to obtain the most comparable statistics. 
We obtained a PDSS reduction nearly identical to that of 
Meuret et al. (2008) Reductions in SDS and ASI were also 
very similar, although it is noted that the present sample 
exhibited somewhat smaller reductions in MI-AAL and 
BDI than did the Meuret et al. (2008) sample. Interestingly, 
 
PETCO2 increase was greater in the present sample despite 
having higher mean  
PETCO2 levels at pre-treatment.
Discussion
The present study confirms prior results supporting the util-
ity of  
PETCO2 feedback in the respiratory treatment of PD. 
Patients showed a significant decrease in PD severity over 
4 weeks of largely home-based treatment. It is encourag-
ing that despite the brevity of the active intervention (4 
weeks), gains appear to be largely sustained after treatment 
discontinuation, with high rates of response and remission 
obtained over a 12-month period. Importantly, the present 
study demonstrates the capacity of results from an RCT, 
conducted in an academic setting, to translate to more typi-
cal clinical settings and patients. The present study was 
substantially more ethnically diverse, with more depres-
sive comorbidity and medication use, than were those in 
the original CART RCT (Meuret et al. 2008). Unlike the 
 57

1 3
Meuret trial, which was conducted in an academic set-
ting with a single clinician who is an expert in PD and the 
developer of CART, the present study was conducted at 
multiple non-academic clinical sites, with several different 
clinicians at varying levels of expertise. Despite these dif-
ferences, we obtained a reduction in PD severity that was 
nearly identical to that obtained in the RCT.
The primary limitation of the present trial is the absence 
of a control group; as such, these results cannot be consid-
ered a definitive documentation of efficacy. The waitlist-
controlled trial by Meuret et al. (2008) provided initial 
evidence of efficacy, while the present study extends those 
findings to document feasibility and utility in more natural-
istic treatment settings.
The extent of treatment moderation awaits further 
exploration. We found that patients who were hypocapnic 
at pre-treatment exhibited a greater increase in  
PETCO2 
at post-treatment and at follow-up than did patients who 
were normocapnic at pre-treatment. However, the extent 
to which this translates into different clinical outcomes is 
unclear. In the present study, as in the initial trial by Meuret 
et al. (2008), the intervention appeared equally effective for 
normocapnic and hypocapnic patients at post-treatment.
The potential practical benefits of CGRI are many. 
Given the barriers to receiving other forms of empiri-
cally-supported therapy for PD, the fact that CGRI is a 
non-pharmacologic approach that can be made widely 
available at a relatively low cost makes it particularly 
desirable. Patient compliance was high, as was patient 
satisfaction. Adverse events were fairly rare, and gen-
erally limited to mild dizziness or lightheadedness in 
the initial training sessions. The system allows thera-
pists to monitor patients’ progress remotely, using a 
secure server, thus potentially allowing them to treat a 
larger number of patients over a wider geographic area. 
When these factors are considered along with the strong 
treatment response in the present sample and in previ-
ous research, CGRI merits consideration as a treatment 
option for PD.
