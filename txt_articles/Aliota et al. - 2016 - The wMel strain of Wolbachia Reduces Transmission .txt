The wMel strain of Wolbachia 
Reduces Transmission of Zika virus 
by Aedes aegypti
Matthew T. Aliota1, Stephen A. Peinado1, Ivan Dario Velez2 & Jorge E. Osorio1
Zika virus (ZIKV) is causing an explosive outbreak of febrile disease in the Americas. There are no 
effective antiviral therapies or licensed vaccines for this virus, and mosquito control strategies have 
not been adequate to contain the virus. A promising candidate for arbovirus control and prevention 
relies on the introduction of the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This 
primarily has been proposed as a tool to control dengue virus (DENV) transmission; however, evidence 
suggests Wolbachia infections confer protection for Ae. aegypti against other arboviruses. At present, 
it is unknown whether or not ZIKV can infect, disseminate, and be transmitted by Wolbachia-infected 
Ae. aegypti. Using Ae. aegypti infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia that are being released in 
Medellin, Colombia, we report that these mosquitoes have reduced vector competence for ZIKV. 
These results support the use of Wolbachia biocontrol as a multivalent strategy against Ae. aegypti-
transmitted viruses.
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus that belongs to the family Flaviviridae. It currently is causing an explosive 
outbreak of febrile disease in the Americas. In humans, ZIKV infection typically causes a mild and self-limiting 
illness known as Zika fever, which often is accompanied by maculopapular rash, headache, and myalgia1,2. During 
the current outbreak, a causal relationship has been established between prenatal ZIKV infection and microceph-
aly and other serious brain anomalies3–6. Prior to this, ZIKV existed in relative obscurity with only sporadic con-
firmed human infections until the end of the last century7. The virus is believed to have originated in Africa, where 
it still circulates enzootically among unknown vertebrate hosts (presumably nonhuman primates), and is trans-
mitted by arboreal Aedes mosquitoes8–10. These cycles lead to occasional outbreaks of spillover infection in Africa, 
but most human cases around the globe result from ZIKV emergence into a human-mosquito cycle involving 
Aedes aegypti11 and/or other urban or peri-urban Aedes species, e.g., Aedes albopictus and Aedes hensilli12–14.
Despite the continued spread of the virus, there remain no effective antiviral therapies or licensed vaccines. 
Thus, with its continued invasion of the new world, the only tools presently available to combat Zika target mos-
quito populations, mostly with insecticides and larval source reduction. To date, these strategies have not pre-
vented invasion of this virus into new locales and have not been adequate to control the virus upon arrival. A 
promising candidate for arbovirus control and prevention relies on the introduction of the intracellular bacterium 
Wolbachia into Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Wolbachia is a maternally-inherited intracellular bacterium that is present 
in numerous insect species worldwide, including mosquitoes, butterflies, beetles, ants, and bees15,16. Interestingly, 
Ae. aegypti has no native Wolbachia symbionts. The wMelPop strain of the bacterium therefore was introduced 
into Ae. aegypti with the intent to control dengue virus (DENV) transmission by shortening the lifespan of female 
mosquitoes17. This alone could have had a potentially major impact on disease transmission by greatly reducing 
the number of females old enough to transmit the virus18; however, that strain of Wolbachia no longer is being 
considered for biocontrol because infected mosquitoes displayed reduced fitness in small-scale field releases19. 
Serendipitously, it also was discovered that some Wolbachia interfere with viruses and other microbes in the same 
host. For example, certain Wolbachia variants (e.g., the wMel strain) partially block DENV transmission with-
out greatly impacting Ae. aegypti fitness20–22. The wMel strain conferred protection against chikungunya virus 
(CHIKV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) in Ae. aegypti as well23–25. These findings lend optimism that Wolbachia 
biocontrol represents a significant new development in the fight against arbovirus transmission. Indeed, because 
DENV, CHIKV, YFV, and now ZIKV26–28 co-circulate in many parts of the tropics Wolbachia biocontrol could

potentially be used as a multivalent strategy against all four of these Ae. aegypti-transmitted viruses. But the abil-
ity of ZIKV to infect, disseminate, and be transmitted by Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti has not been evaluated.
Accordingly, we assessed vector competence for ZIKV in wMel-infected and wMel-free Ae. aegypti from 
Medellin, Colombia. This was done because medium-scale deployments of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti began in 
the DENV metropolitan area of Medellin in the spring of last year (2015) [see www.eliminatedengue.com/colom-
bia], and now ZIKV co-circulates with DENV in Colombia. The data presented herein provide information on 
the effectiveness of Colombian Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti in blocking the transmission of ZIKV, as well as 
describe a biologically relevant model for studying ZIKV transmission dynamics (i.e., exposure to virus was 
accomplished by feeding on a viremic host) that does not rely on animal blood spiked with cultured virus. These 
data argue for the expansion of this technology to ZIKV in South and Central America and are useful in the 
broader context of ZIKV-mosquito interactions in the Americas.
Results
Here, we verified that the phenotype of reduced vector competence existed in Wolbachia-infected laboratory 
colonies of Colombian Ae. aegypti for ZIKV. Adult, female, mosquitoes were exposed to infectious bloodmeals 
containing ZIKV and mosquitoes that ingested blood containing virus were assayed for infection, dissemination, 
and transmission potential at 4, 7, 10, 14, and 17 days (d) post feeding (PF). ZIKV infection status was confirmed 
by plaque assay to differentiate infectious from non-infectious virus. As expected, infection, dissemination, and 
transmission rates were high for WT exposed to blood containing ZIKV. In contrast, (COL)wMel that ingested 
blood containing ZIKV displayed poor peroral vector competence as compared to WT. In fact, there was a signif-
icant reduction (Exact Unconditional Test) in ZIKV infection status as compared to WT at all timepoints assayed 
and across replicates, and (COL)wMel remained non-infective over the duration of experimentation (Figs 1–3). 
Similar findings also were recently reported by Dutra et al.29.
These data also are informative for a more accurate appraisal of ZIKV transmission by Ae. aegypti. To better 
understand ZIKV transmission dynamics, we assessed the subtleties of infection in WT over time following infec-
tious bloodmeals that were in agreement with viremias detected in patients in Colombia where the mean ± 
 stand-
ard deviation serum viral load was 4.42 log10 viral copies/ml ± 
 1.02 (n = 
 10, range = 
 2.73–5.84 log10 viral copies/ml). 
 
After feeding on ZIKV-infected mice with moderate viremia (6.02 log10 PFU/ml), 100% of WT mosquitoes had 
established infections at 4 d PF, but none of the mosquitoes disseminated virus nor was infectious virus detected 
in the saliva (Fig. 1A). At 7 d PF, most mosquitoes disseminated virus (95%) and a moderate number also were 
infective (Fig. 1B). By 10 d PF, the transmission rate had increased to 28% (Fig. 1C). In contrast, WT that fed on 
ZIKV-infected mice with low viremia (4.74 log10 PFU/ml) did not have detectable virus in the saliva until 14 d 
PF (Fig. 2A–C).
To investigate whether or not higher viral titers in the bloodmeal increase the probability of mosquito infec-
tion, mosquitoes were exposed to a relatively high viremic bloodmeal (8.00 log10 PFU/ml) via water-jacketed 
membrane feeder maintained at 36.5 °C30. Surprisingly, infection, dissemination, and transmission rates were 
almost identical for both (COL)wMel and WT exposed to viremic mice as compared to mosquitoes exposed to 
a membrane feeder spiked to a higher viremia (Figs 1 and 3). At 10 d PF, the infection rate for mouse-exposed 
(COL)wMel was 27% (Fig. 1C) and for membrane feeder-exposed (COL)wMel it was 22% (Fig. 3A). Likewise, the 
transmission rate for mouse-exposed WT was 28% and for membrane feeder-exposed WT it was 21%. By 17 d PF, 
the transmission rate peaked at 56% for membrane feeder-exposed WT (Fig. 3B). In comparison, we observed a 
transmission rate of 67% at 14 d PF in WT that were exposed to mice with relatively low viremias (Fig. 2C). These 
data highlight the importance of investigating vector competence by allowing mosquitoes to feed on a viremic 
host because membrane feeding influenced the magnitude of the observed effect.
Discussion
There is a paucity of data available on vector competence for ZIKV. The few studies available have primarily 
focused on two urban vectors, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus13,31, but other Aedes species may be important vec-
tors depending on the specific geographic location12,32,33. The first ZIKV vector competence study with Ae. aegypti 
was conducted in 195634 and it was demonstrated that Ae. aegypti was capable of transmitting ZIKV for ten weeks. 
Interestingly, ZIKV was not detectable on days 5 and 10 PF. Another study involving transmission to a rhesus 
monkey demonstrated that the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of ZIKV was about 15 days35. Both of these 
results differ from what we report here. We were able to detect ZIKV infection in Ae. aegypti as early as 4 d PF and 
the EIP of ZIKV ranged from 7–14 days depending on viremia of the host. This may indicate differences between 
the propensity of African versus Asian lineage ZIKV to infect and replicate in Ae. aegypti but will require further 
validation in the laboratory.
More recently, it was demonstrated that Singapore’s Ae. aegypti were highly capable of transmitting ZIKV36. In 
contrast, Ae. aegypti strains from Kedougou and Dakar (Senegal) were not competent to transmit ZIKV32. Similar 
results recently were observed with Ae. aegypti strains from the Americas, which were susceptible to ZIKV infec-
tion but had unexpectedly low transmission potential31. Here we demonstrated that a strain of Ae. aegypti from 
Medellin, Colombia was highly susceptible to ZIKV infection and were competent in their potential to transmit 
the virus to a new host. It should be noted that Ae. aegypti with poor competence but high population density, 
have been capable of sustaining arbovirus outbreaks37. And, that the geographic variation in oral susceptibility 
of mosquitoes of the same species to different viruses is not unusual38–40. This argues for continued studies (both 
experimental and epidemiological) assessing interactions between differing Ae. aegypti-ZIKV combinations.
The history of ZIKV has been reminiscent of CHIKV, which re-emerged out of Africa and now circulates 
on all inhabited continents and represents a major global health problem. Not surprisingly, ZIKV has emerged 
in Colombia2, likely following the path of CHIKV, which reached the country in August 201441 and now both 
viruses co-circulate with DENV and YFV. Current vector control measures have been insufficient in preventing

invasion of ZIKV and CHIKV into the country or controlling it after invasion. Although primarily deployed 
as a biocontrol tool for DENV, evidence suggests that Wolbachia can limit infection in Ae. aegypti with other 
 
arboviruses24,25; therefore, Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti could potentially be used to simultaneously control 
DENV, CHIKV, YFV, and ZIKV. As a result, we evaluated whether Colombian mosquitoes infected with the wMel 
strain of Wolbachia reduced ZIKV transmission potential. Studies like this one, aimed at assessing the poten-
tial effectiveness of Wolbachia biocontrol against ZIKV, will help inform the viability of using this technology 
as a multivalent strategy for multiple Ae. aegypti-transmitted arboviruses. This novel approach is already being 
tested in five countries around the globe (Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, and Vietnam) against related 
arboviruses, so these results warrant further exploration, both in the laboratory and the field, on the feasibility of 
expanding this technology beyond DENV and informing whether Wolbachia biocontrol can be used to supple-
ment or replace existing vector control strategies.

41 ovitraps placed around the municipality of Bello (commune 1), a northwest suburb of Medellin, Colombia. 
The Wolbachia-infected ((COL)wMel; infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia pipientis) mosquito line was 
generated by crossing wild-caught Aedes aegypti with a wMel-infected laboratory strain of Ae. aegypti using a 
scheme of mating to field-collected males as developed by Yeap et al.43 to generate a Colombian genetic back-
ground Wolbachia-infected mosquito. The wMel-infected laboratory population of Ae. aegypti originated from 
eggs provided by Scott O’Neill (Monash University, Victoria Australia). Briefly, females from the wMel-infected 
laboratory population were backcrossed to wild-caught males until generation five at which time the lines were 
closed (restricting matings to mosquitoes from within the line) with the population size maintained at several 
thousand adults. An outcrossed line then was established by continuous backcrossing laboratory mosquitoes to 
the progeny of wild-caught Ae. aegypti from the Bello region (same location as eventual release zones). The WT 
line was derived from material collected from the same 41 ovitraps distributed throughout the suburb of Bello, 
Colombia. This line has never had any previous contact with Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. Wild-caught males 
from the Bello region were routinely collected and introduced into the (COL)wMel and WT colony cages after 
each generation to prevent inbreeding effects and to ensure the genetic homogeneity of these two lines. Wolbachia 
infection status was routinely verified using PCR with primers specific to the IS5 repeat element20.
Exposure to infective bloodmeal. 
Mosquitoes were exposed to ZIKV by feeding on isoflurane anes-
thetized ZIKV-infected Ifnar−/− mice. These mice have abrogated type I interferon signaling and as a result 
develop lethal infection and a high viremia. Ifnar−/− mice on the C57BL/6 background were obtained from 
Eva Harris (University California-Berkeley, Berkeley, CA) and were bred in the pathogen-free animal facilities 
of the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine. Groups of three-week-old mixed sex 
mice were used for mosquito exposures. Mice were infected in the left, hind foot pad with 106 plaque forming 
units (PFU) of ZIKV in 50 μ 
l of animal diluent (AD: 1% heat-inactivated FBS in Dulbecco’s PBS). Uninfected 
mosquitoes (both WT and (COL)wMel) were allowed to feed on mice two or three days post infection at which 
time sub-mandibular blood draws were performed and serum was collected to verify viremia. Mice fed upon two 
days post infection (biological replicate one) yielded an infectious bloodmeal concentration of 6.02 log10 PFU/
ml ± 
 0.67 (mean ± 
 standard deviation; n = 
 4) and mice fed upon three days post infection (biological replicate 
two) yielded an infectious bloodmeal concentration of 4.74 log10 PFU/ml ± 
 0.06. A third biological replicate 
was performed, whereby mosquitoes were exposed to a ZIKV-infected bloodmeal via water-jacketed membrane 
feeder maintained at 36.5 °C30. Bloodmeals consisted of defibrinated sheep blood (HemoStat Laboratories) and 
fresh virus supernatant, yielding an infectious bloodmeal concentration of 8.0 log10 PFU/ml (bloodmeal titer was 
determined after feeding).
Vector Competence. 
Infection, dissemination, and transmission rates were determined for individual 
mosquitoes and sample sizes were chosen using long established procedures25,44,45. Briefly, three- to six-day-old 
female mosquitoes were sucrose starved for 14 to 16 hours prior to exposure to mice or membrane feeder. 
Mosquitoes that fed to repletion were randomized, separated into cartons in groups of 20–30, and maintained 
on 0.3 M sucrose in an environmental chamber at 26.5 °C ± 1 °C, 75% ± 5% relative humidity, and with a 12 hour 
photoperiod within the Department of Pathobiological Sciences BSL3 Insectary facility at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison. All samples were screened by plaque assay on Vero cells. Dissemination was indicated by 
virus-positive legs. Transmission was defined as release of infectious virus with salivary secretions, i.e., the poten-
tial to infect another host, and was indicated by virus positive-salivary secretions.
Viral Quantification. 
All ZIKV screens from mosquito tissues and titrations for virus quantification from 
mouse serum or virus stocks were completed by plaque assay on Vero cell cultures. Duplicate wells were infected 
with 0.1 ml aliquots from serial 10-fold dilutions in growth media and virus was adsorbed for one hour. Following 
incubation, the inoculum was removed, and monolayers were overlaid with 3 ml containing a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% 
oxoid agar and 2X DMEM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 2% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomy-
cin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for four days for plaque development. Cell monolayers then were 
stained with 3 ml of overlay containing a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% oxoid agar and 2X DMEM with 2% (vol/vol) FBS, 
2% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.33% neutral red (Gibco). Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C and 
plaques were counted. Viral RNA from human serum samples from Colombia was quantified by qRT-PCR using 
the primers and probe designed by Lanciotti et al.46. The RT-PCR was performed using the iTaqTM Universal 
One-Step RT-qPCR kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA) on an iCycler® instrument (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Primers and 
probe were used at final concentrations of 600 nm and 100 nm respectively. Cycling conditions were as follows: 
37 °C for 15 min, 50 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 15 sec and 60 °C for 1 min. 
Virus concentration was determined by interpolation onto an internal standard curve made up of a 7-point dilu-
tion series of in vitro transcribed RNA.
Statistical Analysis. 
Infection, dissemination, and transmission rates were analyzed using an Exact uncon-
ditional test47. This test replaces Fisher’s exact test. It also is exact but has the advantage of being more sensitive in 
detecting differences (i.e., its statistical power is higher) in the case of sample sizes less than 10047. Each biological 
replicate consisted of mosquitoes from distinct generations to take into account stochastic variations.
