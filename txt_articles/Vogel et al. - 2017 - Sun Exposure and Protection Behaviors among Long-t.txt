Abstract
Introduction: Melanoma is considered a generally preventable
cancer, with excessive ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure being
a strong causal factor. UVR exposure following a melanoma
diagnosis can be modified to reduce risk of second primary
melanomas. The goal of this study was to compare measures of
UVR exposure and protection behaviors between long-term mel-
anoma survivors and controls.
Methods: Participants from a previously conducted case–
control study were recruited for a cross-sectional survey. Mel-
anoma cases were 25 to 59 years old at diagnosis; controls were
age and sex matched. Participants were asked about UVR
exposure and protection measures used in the past year, and
comparisons between melanoma survivors and controls were
conducted using logistic regression models, adjusting for
potential confounders.
Results: A total of 724 (62.0%) long-term melanoma survi-
vors and 660 (59.9%) controls completed the follow-up survey.
Melanoma survivors were significantly less likely to report high
sun exposure on a typical weekday [OR, 0.72 (0.55–0.94)],
sunburns [OR, 0.40 (0.30–0.53)], or indoor tanning [OR, 0.20
(0.09–0.44)] than controls; however, high sun exposure on a
typical weekend day was similar. Report of optimal sun pro-
tection behaviors was higher in melanoma survivors compared
with controls. However, a few melanoma survivors reported
indoor tanning, 10% reported intentionally seeking sun to tan,
and 20% reported sunburns.
Conclusions:
Although
long-term
melanoma
survivors
reported healthier UVR exposure and protection behaviors
compared with controls, a sizeable proportion still reported
elevated sun exposure, sunburns, and suboptimal UVR protec-
tion behaviors.
Impact: Opportunities remain for improving sun protection
to reduce future melanoma risk among melanoma survivors.

Introduction
Melanoma is considered a generally preventable cancer, with
excessive ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure being one of the
strongest risk factors for the disease (1, 2). Additional risk
factors include a large number of moles and/or freckles, fair
skin, light hair or eye color, family history of melanoma, and
immune suppression (3). Patients diagnosed with melanoma
experience high rates of recurrence with an approximately
9-fold increased risk of developing another melanoma (4).
Excess risk of recurrence remains 20 years after the initial
diagnosis (4, 5). For melanomas that develop as a consequence
of UVR exposure, the damage done to the skin prior to the first
melanoma cannot be ameliorated, and this damage may
increase risk of a subsequent melanoma. Importantly, however,
UVR exposure following a melanoma diagnosis can be mod-
ified to reduce risk of a new melanoma diagnosis (6).
It has been suggested that cancer may be a "teachable moment"
for health behavior change (7). Unfortunately, while some cancer
survivors initiate positive health behaviors, others do not (8). In
the case of melanoma, reduction of sun exposure is paramount.
Individuals are advised to limit time in the sun during peak hours,
seek shade, wear protective clothing, use sunscreen, and avoid
indoor tanning devices (9).
The young age at diagnosis of melanoma for some suggests
ample opportunity to engage in improved sun protection
behaviors following diagnosis. Little research has documented
UVR exposure among melanoma survivors. Results from stud-
ies to date on sun protection behaviors among melanoma
survivors have been mixed, though most suggest that if an
improvement in sun behaviors among melanoma survivors is
present, it is moderate (10, 11). Further clarification of these
behaviors in long-term melanoma survivors is needed to help
devise effective interventions for this group. In particular, data
are lacking on sun exposure patterns and specific sun protection
behaviors compared with an appropriately matched control
group with measured potential confounders. The objective of
this study was to compare measures of UVR exposure and
protection behaviors between long-term melanoma survivors
and controls.

 Materials and Methods
Study design and population
Approval for this study was granted by the University of
Minnesota Institutional Review Board and the Minnesota
Cancer Surveillance System. We recruited participants from the
Skin Health Study, a population-based case–control study
conducted from 2004 to 2009 designed to assess indoor tan-
ning use and risk of melanoma. The Skin Health Study is
described elsewhere (12). Briefly, cases in the Skin Health Study
were ascertained by the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System,
a population-based, statewide cancer registry. Individuals with
invasive cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between July 2004
and December 2007, between the ages of 25 and 59, with a state
driver's license or state identification card, were eligible to
participate. Controls were randomly selected from the Minne-
sota state driver's license list (which included persons with state
identification cards) and frequency-matched to cases in a 1:1
ratio on age (in 5-year age groups) and sex. Eligible cases and
controls were required to be English-speaking and to have a
telephone number. A total of 1,167 cases (84.6% among
eligible) and 1,101 controls (69.2% among eligible) partici-
pated in the original study.
Recruitment and data collection
All Skin Health Study participants who were alive at the time of
the survey administration were identified for this follow-up study.
Deaths among cases and controls were identified using the Min-
nesota Death Index and the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance
System. Cause of death was ascertained whenever possible. The
Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System required updated permis-
sion from the physician of record in the registry before re-con-
tacting each person with melanoma (case).
Participants were recruited by mail to complete an online or
paper survey using methods outlined by Dillman to maximize
response (13). We recruited potential participants by sending an
initial letter with a link to the online survey, programmed using
REDCap (14), along with an incentive (two $2 bills). Three
additional reminder letters and a paper copy of the survey were
sent to nonresponders.
Survey measures
The primary outcomes for this follow-up study were self-
reported sun exposure and protection measures. The validated
questionnaire included nine items related to sun exposure and
protection practices (15, 16). All items had categorical responses.
Two questions asked about number of hours outside per day
between 10 am and 4 pm in the summer separately for weekdays
and weekend days using the following categories: 0 to 30 minutes,
31 minutes to 1 hour, 2, hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, or 6
hours. Participants were also asked to report the number of red or
painful sunburns that lasted a day or more in the past year: 0, 1, 2,
3, 4, or 5 or more. Sun protection methods utilized during the
summer on a warm sunny day, including wearing sunscreen, a
shirt with sleeves, or a hat with a wide brim, staying in the shade,
and spending time in the sun in order to get a tan (intentional
tanning), were collected using the following categories: never,
rarely, sometimes, often, or always. The final question asked
whether the participant had used a tanning bed or booth in the
past 12 months (yes, no). For the purposes of this analysis and
ease of interpretation, all measures were dichotomized into
"optimal" and "suboptimal" categories. The following were con-
sidered optimal: weekday sun exposure in the summer of 1 hour
or less, weekend day sun exposure in the summer of 1 hour or less,
no sunburns in the past year, no indoor tanning in the past year,
and reporting often or always using sunscreen, often or always
wearing a shirt with sleeves, often or always wearing a hat, often or
always staying in the shade, and rarely or never intentionally
tanning.
Potential confounders collected at the time of the original study
included self-report of skin, hair, and eye color, and presence and
pattern of freckles and moles. Indoor tanning and sun exposure,
history and number of painful sunburns before and after age 18,
and sun protection behaviors, including sunscreen use, were
collected during a telephone interview. A phenotypic risk score
was calculated based on hair and eye color, and tanning ability
using a previously reported measure (17). Potential confounders
collected at the time of the follow-up survey included education,
income, smoking status, personal history of other skin cancer, and
family history of melanoma.
Statistical methods
To assess how death and nonresponse may have biased the
results, comparisons were made between those eligible and
ineligible for the study and between those who did and did not
participate in the follow-up survey using data from the original
Skin Health Study.
Demographic, general health characteristics, and prediagno-
sis sun exposure and protection behaviors were compared
between melanoma survivors and population controls that
completed the survey using c2 tests for categorical data and
t tests and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests as appropriate for
continuous data.
Primary analyses compared optimal UVR exposure and pro-
tection behaviors between melanoma survivors and population
controls. Controls who reported a personal history of melano-
ma at the time of the follow-up study (N ¼ 21) were excluded
from the analysis. Initial comparisons between melanoma
survivors and population controls for all categories were con-
ducted using c2 tests. Multivariate logistic regression models,
both sex and age-adjusted, and fully-adjusted, were conducted,
and ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each outcome
are presented. Confounding variables were defined a priori and
included age (continuous), sex, education (high school, voca-
tion/associates, some college, college graduate, graduate/pro-
fessional
degree),
income
(<$50,000,
$50,000–$74,999,
$75,000–$149,999, $150,000þ, prefer not to say), current
smoking status, phenotypic risk score (low, intermediate,
high), freckles (none/few/some/many),
moles
(none/few/
some/many), personal history of other skin cancer, family
history of melanoma, and sun exposure data reported prior
to diagnosis (lifetime sun exposure, outdoor activity sun expo-
sure, mean sunscreen use, and number of sunburns).
To explore whether differences in optimal UVR exposure and
sun protection behaviors between melanoma survivors and con-
trols differed according to age or sex, stratified analyses were
conducted within age groups (30–49, 50–59, 60–72 years) and
by sex. Analyses were fully adjusted for all confounders, as
previously described, and an interaction effect was included to
examine whether a statistically significant interaction between
melanoma status and age or sex was present. P values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

 Results
Among cases and controls from the Skin Health Study, 724
(62.0%) melanoma survivors and 660 (59.9%) controls com-
pleted the follow-up survey (Table 1). A total of 80 cases died
during the follow-up period; the cause of death was available
for 73, and 54 died of melanoma. A total of 15 controls died
during the follow-up period; the cause of death was available
for 10 and none died of melanoma. Those who completed the
survey were generally similar to those who did not respond,
though they were older, more likely to have completed college,
and less likely to have ever used indoor tanning. When exam-
ined separately for melanoma survivors and controls, these
differences were similar. Melanoma survivors and controls were
not statistically significantly different across the demographic
and health characteristics with the exceptions of race and
smoking status (Table 2). However, melanoma survivors were
more likely than controls to have a high phenotypic risk score
(P < 0.0001), some to many freckles (P < 0.0001), some to
many moles (P < 0.0001), use indoor tanning before their
diagnosis (P < 0.0001), and report more lifetime sunburns
prior to their diagnosis (P < 0.0001).
Melanoma survivors were diagnosed an average of 9.6 � 1.0
years prior to completing the survey; the majority (85.6%) had
stage I disease, 6.4% had stage II disease, 6.6% had stage III
disease, and 1.4% had stage IV disease. The most common site was
the trunk (35.0%), followed by legs (26.9%), arms (26.4%), and
head/neck (11.7%). Almost all (99.3%) had surgery and about
one-third had lymph node dissection (34.8%).
Compared with controls, survivors were statistically significant-
ly more likely to report optimal exposure behaviors with the
exception of sun exposure on weekend days in the summer
(Table 3). Specifically, survivors were less likely to spend more
than 1 hour outside on weekdays during the summer (34.3%
vs. 44.4%, P ¼ 0.01), less likely to report a sunburn in the past
year (19.5% vs. 36.5%, P < 0.0001), less likely to have indoor
tanned in the past year (1.7% vs. 6.8%, P < 0.0001), and less
likely to intentionally tan (10.4% vs. 23.2%, P < 0.0001) than
controls. Of note, however, the proportion of melanoma survi-
vors who reported spending more than 1 hour in the sun on a
typical weekend day in the summer was similar to controls.
In addition, melanoma survivors compared with controls
were more likely to report often or always engaging in sun
protection behaviors, including wearing sunscreen (61.9% vs.
38.4%, P < 0.0001), a shirt with sleeves (77.0% vs. 65.9%, P <
0.0001), and a hat (33.2% vs. 22.6%, P ¼ 0.01); survivors were
also more likely to stay in the shade in the summer (48.1% vs.
28.7%, P < 0.0001; Table 4). These comparisons were similar
when stratified by weekday and weekend sun exposure (data
not shown).
Results from the comparison of optimal UVR exposure and sun
protection behaviors between melanoma survivors and controls
by age group were similar to the overall comparison with the
exception of hours spent in the sun on weekend days. The oldest
melanoma survivors were more likely to avoid sun exposure on
weekend days compared with controls, whereas those 30 to 49
and 50 to 59 years old reported similar sun exposure on weekend
days compared with controls. While males and females differed in
their sun exposure and protection behaviors, the stratified com-
parisons by sex between melanoma survivors and controls were
similar to the overall comparisons in direction and magnitude of
the associations.
Discussion
This follow-up study of participants in a case-control of mel-
anoma is the largest to date to report UVR exposure and protection
behaviors of long-term melanoma survivors compared with a
control group. Our study provides a more complete picture of the
UVR exposure and protection habits of melanoma survivors as
compared with a similarly recruited population control group
than previous research. Consistent with other health behaviors
reported by cancer survivors (18) and a recent meta-analysis of the
limited available literature among melanoma survivors (19), our
study indicates long-term melanoma survivors report healthier
UVR exposure and protection behaviors compared with controls.
Despite this, opportunities remain to reduce future melanoma
risk among melanoma survivors as a significant proportion still
report elevated sun exposure, sunburns, and suboptimal sun
protection behaviors.
Exposure to UVR is a significant and modifiable risk factor for
melanoma, with intermittent exposure and sunburns identified
as the main causes (20). While debate continues about the best
sun protection methods for skin cancer prevention (21), UVR
avoidance, including from sun and artificial sources, is crucial.
Few studies report UVR exposure among melanoma survivors,
with most focusing on frequency of sunbathing or indoor
tanning as opposed to time spent in the sun. Consistent with
our results, a recent qualitative study reported many melanoma
survivors are more conscious of sun exposure and protection
(22). However, melanoma survivors in our study reported
being outside more than 1 hour on weekend days during peak
hours in the summer at similar levels as controls. One possible
explanation for this is that this study included long-term
melanoma survivors. A small prospective study of melanoma
survivors and controls found that UVR exposure was initially
lower among survivors compared with controls but then con-
verged over the 3-year study (23, 24).
We found that few melanoma survivors and controls reported
indoor tanning in the past year. This may be explained by the fact
that this study population is now older and therefore less likely to
use indoor tanning, and prevalence of indoor tanning has
declined over time (25). While long-term melanoma survivors
were less likely to report indoor tanning in the past year than
controls, a small number of survivors reported still engaging in
this behavior. This phenomenon has been reported elsewhere
(26, 27) and indicates a small proportion of individuals will
continue this high-risk behavior despite a melanoma diagnosis.

 Sunburn is a critical measure of excessive sun exposure. A meta-
analysis found increased risk of melanoma with increasing sun-
burns throughout the lifetime, not just sunburns obtained during
childhood (28), emphasizing the importance of continued and
improved sunburn prevention among melanoma survivors. Few
studies have reported sunburn occurrence among melanoma
survivors, however. A large international online survey had a
subgroup of participants who reported a previous melanoma
diagnosis, and 27% of those cases reported at least one severe
sunburn in the past year (29); that percentage is similar to our
result of 20%. While our study indicates melanoma survivors are
about half as likely to report sunburn in the previous year
compared with controls, a significant minority engage in beha-
viors that result in sunburns.
A number of studies have reported sunscreen use among
melanoma survivors (10, 11, 27, 30–33); however, a review found
that general population estimates of regular sunscreen use vary
greatly in the literature (7%–90%; ref. 34); therefore, it is critical to
simultaneously collect data on population controls for compar-
ison. Few studies have included a control group (23, 24, 26, 35);
the largest to date compared 156 melanoma survivors with
11,408 respondents without cancer who participated in 2005
and 2007 National Cancer Institute Health Information National
Trends Surveys (HINTS; 26). Notably, the results were similar to
our study, though HINTS respondents reported slightly lower
frequencies of sunscreen use.
Wearing UVR protective clothing and staying in the shade
during peak hours are recommended as important components
of proper sun protection. A few studies have reported increases in
sun-protection behaviors among melanoma patients following
diagnosis (30, 32, 36). Studies of melanoma survivors alone, one
of which included longer-term survivors, found modest sun
protection behaviors similar to our results (10, 11). In compar-
ison to non-cancer controls, two studies found that melanoma
survivors use sunscreen and seek shade more frequently than
controls (26, 29), whereas another study found sun protection
behaviors were similar to general population estimates (10). As
found previously, these differences were modest, however, with
more than half reporting they do not wear a hat or stay in the
shade during peak hours.
While this study has many strengths, including the large
sample size, population-based sample, and inclusion of a con-
trol group with measured confounding factors, we note impor-
tant limitations. As with other self-reported measures, partici-
pants may have over-reported behaviors due to social desirabil-
ity, particularly among melanoma survivors, resulting in an
overestimate of sun protection behaviors leading to potential
bias. The self-report measures used have been previously shown
to compare well with direct observation measures, however
(16). We were unable to make comparisons with the sun
exposure and protection data prior to the diagnosis due to
differences in measures. Another limitation is that survivors
who responded to our survey may be more likely to practice
health behaviors, or those who are still alive may be those who
frequently use optimal sun protection behaviors. Further, unfor-
tunately, we do not have access to the information on second
primary melanomas for all participants and therefore were
unable to address that outcome.

 Despite limitations, this study contributes to the field as the
largest to date to examine the sun exposure and protection
behaviors of long-term melanoma survivors as compared with
similarly recruited controls. While a melanoma diagnosis may
serve as a trigger for behavior change for many, resulting in
better sun protection among survivors compared with controls,
one-fifth of survivors experienced sunburn in the past year and
many reported engaging in suboptimal sun protection beha-
viors. These data suggest that interventions are needed to
further improve sun behaviors and reduce future risk of skin
cancer in this population.
