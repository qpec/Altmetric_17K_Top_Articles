Transcranial electric stimulation is a non-invasive tool that can influence brain activity;
however, the parameters necessary to affect local circuits in vivo remain to be explored. Here,
we report that in rodents and human cadaver brains, ~75% of scalp-applied currents are
attenuated by soft tissue and skull. Using intracellular and extracellular recordings in rats, we
find that at least 1 mV/mm voltage gradient is necessary to affect neuronal spiking and
subthreshold currents. We designed an ‘intersectional short pulse’ stimulation method to
inject sufficiently high current intensities into the brain, while keeping the charge density and
sensation on the scalp surface relatively low. We verify the regional specificity of this novel
method in rodents; in humans, we demonstrate how it affects the amplitude of simulta-
neously recorded EEG alpha waves. Our combined results establish that neuronal circuits are
instantaneously affected by intensity currents that are higher than those used in conventional
protocols.

lectric fields, generated either by neurons themselves or
applied externally, can affect the transmembrane potential
of neurons and, consequently, the probability of occurrence
of action potentials1–3. Forced electric fields, induced either
locally (e.g., by deep brain stimulation) or non-invasively through
the scalp (e.g., by transcranial electrical stimulation; TES)4–7, can
probe neural patterns and potentially to ameliorate brain disease8.
Yet, there is no accepted theory to explain how TES affects
neuronal circuits in the brain, mainly because the physiological
mechanisms of TES are not well understood. Electrical stimula-
tion of the scalp can affect brain activity in multiple indirect ways,
including activation of peripheral nerves7,9,10, retina11, the ves-
tibular apparatus, astrocytes, perivascular elements12,13, and
placebo effects14. Given the important role of brain oscillations in
cognition, an often-stated explicit goal of TES is to bias brain
rhythms acutely or chronically15,16, as opposed to inducing
indirect peripheral effects.
For many therapeutic applications, it is desirable to affect
neurons promptly (e.g., to terminate epileptic seizures), in a
regionally constrained manner to reach maximum on-target
effects and reduce effects on unintended brain networks4,5.
Achieving spatially precise effects by scalp-applied currents
requires knowledge about the spread of electric fields in the
human head17 and the use of novel methods of current delivered
through multiple electrodes18,19.
The effectiveness of currently used TES protocols on local
neuronal networks is a subject of extensive debate14–16,20,21. At
least two factors contribute to this controversy. First, the large
electric fields induced by alternating current TES (transcranial
alternating current stimulation; tACS) often prevents simulta-
neous measurement of electric (electroencephalographic, EEG),
magnetic (magnetoencephalographic, MEG), or imaging (blood
oxygen-level dependent, BOLD) signals22. Recent experiments
attempted to alleviate the amplifier saturation problem and
remove the stimulus artifacts21–23. However, in those experiments
the expected brain rhythm entrainment was examined at the
same frequency of the applied TES (e.g., 10 Hz tACS induced
increased power in the alpha band), raising the possibility that
large tACS artifacts which are several thousand-fold larger than
the scalp signal, or a harmonic of the artifact, have contaminated
the results. A second indirect approach takes the voltage gradients
shown experimentally to produce spike entrainment and esti-
mates the corresponding current intensity applied at the scalp
surface. However, translation of results obtained from models24,
in vitro observations21,22,25,26, and experiments performed on
experimental animals6,27 to humans is complicated by an
incomplete understanding of how skin, subcutaneous soft tissue,
skull, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain folding affects current
spread28. While strong stimulation (>50 mA; 0.5 ms pulses)

The goal of the experiments presented in this paper was to
identify the conditions under which neuronal spikes and local
circuits could be directly affected by TES. To accomplish this goal,
we first determined the voltage gradients necessary to affect the
membrane potential and neuronal spiking in the intact rat brain,
corresponding to approximately 1 mV/mm. Second, we intro-
duced a novel fast pulse stimulation method that allowed
simultaneous recording of electrical activity and focusing induced
fields to target brain structures. We verified the validity of this
method in rats and tested it in human subjects. Third, we mea-
sured the impact of scalp, soft tissue, and skull on current spread
and quantified the induced fields in the brain of human cadavers,

Fig. 3 Intersectional Short Pulse (ISP) stimulation can spatially focus induced fields. a Leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model cartoon to demonstrate the
concept of ISP stimulation. Stimulus current is delivered sequentially through three independent electrode pairs generating a continuously changing
intracerebral gradient pattern. Neuronal cell membranes can integrate these patterns due to their relatively slow membrane time constant (10 ms).
Consequently, neurons at the cross-section of the current flow axes integrate all three stimuli, and become more strongly entrained than neurons located
outside the focus. b Experimental protocol to measure the efficacy of ISP. White circle marks the craniotomy for the example left hippocampal neuron
shown in c. The contralateral craniotomy is not displayed for simplicity. 3D-printed gel electrode holders (anode = left; cathode = right) were attached to
the temporal bones bilaterally with five electrodes on each side. Three electrode pairs were programmed to target the ISP beams on either the left or the
right hemisphere (serving as ISPipsi and ISPcontra conditions for the example in c, respectively). Each electrode pair was pulsed for 2.5 µs and the pulses
cycled through the three pairs for 500 ms followed by non-stimulated 1-s control periods. This sequence was repeated to alternatingly stimulate the right
or left hemisphere. The idealized beam crossings shown here may be modified by the inhomogeneity of brain structures and ventricles. c Response of an

 current enters the brain. Finally, we determined the current levels
of TES necessary to affect the amplitude of alpha waves in human
subjects. Our direct measurements and indirect estimation pro-
vided concordant results and established that in humans at least
4–6 mA currents should be applied by conventional tACS elec-
trodes to reliably and instantaneously affect neuronal circuits.
Results
Subcutaneous and transcutaneous electric stimulation in rats.
Previous in vivo experiments in rodents were performed using
stimulation electrodes placed on the skull4,6 (i.e., subcutaneous
TES) and demonstrated both stimulus-locked firing of neurons in
both neocortex and subcortical structures6 as well as effects on
the amplitude of intracerebrally recorded local field potentials
(LFP)4. Because skin and head musculature surrounding the skull
represent a large shunt which can diffuse the applied current, first
we examined the current loss between scalp and the brain. Using
implanted arrays of electrodes and stimulation pads placed on the
parietal bone and pre-bregma frontal bone, we measured the
intracerebral voltage gradients in the horizontal plane (Fig. 1a, b).
Subcutaneous TES at 50 µA alternating current was sufficient to
induce ~1 mV/mm electric fields (Fig. 1b, d). The distribution of
the electric fields could be biased by different configurations of
bipolar stimulation (Fig. 1b, left-side stimulation: 20.33 (IQR =
11.49–24.52) and 3.65 (IQR = 1.58–8.39) mm2 exceeding 1 mV/
mm on the left and right hemisphere, respectively; P = 0.04; right-
side stimulation: 5.16 (IQR = 1.01–21.76) and 28.37 (IQR =
20.72–31.18) mm2 exceeding 1 mV/mm on the left and right
hemisphere, respectively; P = 0.02; Mann–Whitney U-test and n
= 20 × 2 in both cases). In contrast, applying the current to the
shaved scalp (transcutaneous TES) through the same size elec-
trodes resulted in an 80 ± 5% current loss, independent of the
stimulus intensity (Fig. 1c–e; subcutaneous stimulation: 17.01
(IQR = 14.96–20.85) mV/mm/mA; transcutaneous stimulation:
2.14 (IQR = 1.9–2.44) mV/mm/mA; P < 0.001; paired t-test; n =
20 × 2).
In a more direct physiological comparison, we tested the effects
of externally applied direct currents on the intracellularly
recorded transmembrane potential (Vm) and spiking of neurons
in the deep layers of the visual cortex (Fig. 2a–d). Subcutaneous
(skull) stimulation exerted clear and predictable effects on Vm.
Depending on the polarity of the stimulation, Vm became
depolarized or hyperpolarized in a relatively linear manner (Fig.
2a; Pearson’s linear correlation, R = 0.86, P = 0.002 for transcu-
taneous and R = 0.97, P < 0.001 for subcutaneous stimulation, n =
13, each), and decreased or increased the number of action
potentials, respectively (Fig. 2b; Pearson’s linear correlation, R =
0.80, P = 0.007 for transcutaneous and R = 0.95, P < 0.001 for
subcutaneous stimulation, n = 13, each). Subcutaneous depolariz-

increased firing rate (paired t-test with Bonferroni correction; P =
0.001, <0.001, <0.001 for 200, 600, 800 µA vs. 0 µA; n = 25 firing

band (1–5 Hz; +600 to +800 µA, Mann–Whitney U-test with
Bonferroni correction; P < 0.005, n = 30 power value pairs at each
frequency bin), indicating that subcutaneous stimulation affected
many other neurons as well (Fig. 2c). Hyperpolarizing pulses
exerted opposite effect with similar magnitudes on Vm (paired t-
test with Bonferroni correction; P = 0.003, 0.004 and 0.046 for
−800, −600, −400 µA vs. 0 µA; n = 25 membrane potential
difference values) and reduced firing rate (paired t-test with
Bonferroni correction; P = 0.044, 0.028 for −800 and −600 µA vs.
0 µA; n = 25 firing rate difference values). Using the same current
intensities, transcutaneous (scalp) stimulation produced much
smaller and more variable effects (Vm was affected at anodal
400–800 µA but not by cathodal pulses; paired t-test with
Bonferroni correction; P = 0.044, 0.008, and 0.003 for 400, 600,
and 800 µA vs. 0 µA; n = 40 membrane potential difference values,
and even the highest current intensities failed to affect delta
power Vm or higher frequencies; Fig. 2d; Mann–Whitney U-test
with Bonferroni correction; P > 0.05; n = 35 × 150 spectral ampli-
tude values for all conditions). Spiking activity by transcutane-
nous stimulation was affected at only 800 µA depolarizing pulses
(paired t-test with Bonferroni correction; P = 0.046 for 800 µA vs.
0 µA; n = 35 firing rate difference values), corresponding to
intracranial fields of approximately 2 mV/mm (Fig. 2b, d). In
summary,
electric
fields
applied
either
subcutaneously
or
transcutaneously, which induce at least 1 mV/mm intracerebral
voltage gradient, can affect spiking activity, but stronger fields are
needed to affect network oscillations.
Focused TES effect by Intersectional Short Pulse stimulation.
For many experimental and clinical applications5,22, it would be
desirable to apply TES in a spatially targeted manner and
simultaneously monitor the induced electrical changes to verify
online effectiveness. Because the scalp, skull, and brain conduct
current in a homogenous manner, simultaneous application of
TES through multiple electrode pairs cannot induce a spatially
confined effect (see Supplementary Figure 6b). Our proposed
solution to achieve spatially targeted TES effects is to apply
spatio-temporally rotating Intersectional Short Pulse (ISP) sti-
mulation. This method exploits the short integration time con-
stant of the neuronal membrane (5–20 ms), a mechanism that can
temporally integrate multiple electrical gradients with similar
vector directions (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Figure 1)31. An added
advantage of fast pulse stimulation (2.5 or 10 µs pulse width with
5 or 50 µs pause, depending on the number of electrode pairs) is
that the transients of high frequency pulses affect simultaneously
recorded LFP or neuronal spikes (1 Hz–5 kHz; 20 kHz sampling)
substantially less than conventional tACS and they do not satu-
rate recording amplifiers even at relatively high intensities.
To test our model prediction of focal effect in rats, current
pulses were delivered sequentially and in a spatially asymmetric
manner through independently programmable isolated current
generators, which were connected to a three-dimensional (3-D)
printed gel-electrode strip glued to the temporal bone surface
(Fig. 3b). Unit activity was recorded bilaterally in the hippo-
campal CA1 region with silicon probes (7 anesthetized rats and 1
chronically implanted rat). The hemisphere target of the bipolar
stimulation configuration was alternated (Fig. 3b, c; Supplemen-
tary Figure 2a). The effectiveness of the ISP stimulation on
spatially targeted entrainment of single unit activity is illustrated
for an example neuron from the left hippocampus (Fig. 2c). The
artifacts of the short duration stimulation pulses did not affect the
recording quality as demonstrated by the similar spike waveforms
and spike autocorrelograms of the unit during stimulation and
stimulation-free periods (Fig. 3c). Of the 127 isolated single units,
55 were significantly affected by at least one configuration of the
stimulation protocol (32 increased and 23 decreased, significance
threshold: P < 0.05; Wilcoxon signed rank test; n = 300 firing rate
values for each neuron and condition, all tested against baseline
condition). To quantify the focusing effect of ISP, we calculated
the
fold-change
of
unit
discharge
in
the
left
and
right
hippocampus, respectively. Using only three rotating dipoles,
the current-focusing effect of ISP resulted in a several-fold
increase in induced unit discharge between the targeted and non-
targeted hemispheres (Fig. 3d, 1.8 ± 2.35-fold vs. 1.017 ± 0.63-

units).
In four of the above animals (three anesthetized and one
chronic; 77 units), the spatial selectivity of the ISP method was
compared to traditional direct current (DC) pulses (for DC
stimulation, the electrodes in the same hemisphere were short-
circuited; the same current intensity was used for DC and ISP
stimulation). For each protocol, 500 ms stimulation epochs
alternated with 1000 ms stimulus-free epochs using the following
sequence: ISPleft, ISPright, DCleft, DCright. Eighteen (ISP) and 10
(DC) neurons showed significant firing rate changes to at least
one stimulation configuration (significance threshold; P < 0.05;
Wilcoxon signed rank test; n = 340 firing rate values for each
neuron and condition, tested against baseline). Of the 18 ISP-
driven hippocampal neurons, eight (44%) responded differen-
tially to ISPleft and ISPright conditions (significance threshold: P <

 0.05; paired t-test; n = 340 firing rate pairs for each neuron). Of
the 10 DC-driven neurons, only one neuron (10%) showed
significant difference to left (anode) vs. right (anode) stimulation
(significance threshold: P < 0.05; paired t-test; n = 340 firing rate
pairs for each neuron). In summary, the ISP stimulation affected
neural activity in spatially targeted manner, even though skull
thickness, brain geometry, tissue anisotropy, and ventricles likely
distorted current spread.
Measuring current spread in human cadavers. Currently, the
best estimates of the currents needed to induce electric fields of
sufficient magnitude intracranially are offered by in silico mod-
eling of the human head5,33. However, there are many uncer-
tainties in such modeling. As an alternative to modeling, we
carried out high spatial density, 3-D intracerebral measurements
in cadaver brains in situ (n = 11; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
Prior to each experiment, the subdural space was filled with
physiological saline (0.9% NaCl) solution to replace the cere-
brospinal fluid lost during the insertion of the recording elec-
trodes. Thirty-six custom-made multisite electrodes (three to
seven sites per electrode, 198 in total, Fig. 4a, Supplementary
Figure 3) were inserted into the brain through holes drilled
through the calvarium after removing the soft tissue around the
skull (Fig. 4b, c) to create a 3-D montage. As the overall volume
of the removed skull was negligible compared to the total skull
volume, and the polyimide electrode shafts were tightly sealed,
the conduction/isolation properties of the skull were not affected.
A needle electrode placed into the sagittal sulcus on the forehead
served as the reference electrode. Four or seven pairs of Ag/AgCl
stimulation electrodes were fixed to the skull surface bilaterally by
conductive electrode gel (Fig. 4b, c). Using either DC pulses or
alternating current stimulation (Supplementary Figure 4) showed

reference for the recordings. Ag/AgCl electrodes, marked by blue and red circles for negative and positive polarity, respectively, were fixed to the skull by

fields in a constant voltage mode, as the aggregate resistance decreases (n = 60 from 2 cadavers, P < 0.001 for all conditions)

cadavers) elicited several-fold larger intracerebral gradients compared to transcutaneous stimulation (d, R = 0.8, P < 0.001, n = 16 in 6 cadavers).

 that, similar to the rat, the highest electric fields occurred in the
neocortex near the stimulation electrodes (Fig. 4d; Supplementary
Figure 5). The generated gradient patterns were independent of
whether voltage or current mode was used for stimulation
(Supplementary Figure 6a), and the relationship between applied
current or voltage and the measured electric fields was linear
(Fig. 4e; Pearson’s linear correlation; R = 0.52; P < 0.001; n = 48).
The frequency of stimulation had only a small effect on the
magnitude of the induced fields (Fig. 4f; one-way ANOVA; P =
0.99; F(8, 891) = 0.06; n = 900 trials from 5 cadavers). These
results demonstrate ohmic properties of the brain34, the sur-
rounding skull, and soft tissue with negligible capacitive com-
ponents35.
When
multiple
electrodes
were
simultaneously
stimulated, the common conductive soft tissue summed the
independently applied dipoles, as shown by an equivalent circuit
diagram (Supplementary Figure 6b). As a result, simultaneously
applied multiple stimuli at different locations but with an
increasing phase separation gradually decreased the magnitude of
electric fields (Supplementary Figure 6c). As expected, larger size
electrodes induced larger electric fields (Fig. 4g, case 1: 0.94 ±
0.041, 1.25 ± 0.05, 2.84 ± 0.097 mV/mm, P < 0.001 for all com-
parison; and case 2: 0.23 ± 0.01, 0.32 ± 0.017, 0.43 ± 0.09 mV/
mm, P < 0.001 for all comparison; mean ± SEM; n = 60 gradient
values)36. Unilateral placement of the electrodes restricted the
induced electric fields largely to the selected hemisphere (Fig. 4d;
Supplementary Figure 7; Etargeted = 0.9 ± 0.06 mV/mm and Enon-
targeted = 0.49 ± 0.03 mV/mm, mean ± SD; n = 30 cortical electric
field values), similar to the results obtained in rats (Fig. 1b).
Figure 5 presents comparisons between transcutaneous (scalp),
subcutaneous (skull with scalp removed), and direct epidural
stimulation results (Supplementary Table 3). Transcutaneous
experiments used a limited set of recording electrodes to one
plane of the 3-D matrix (total of 28 contact sites on four
electrodes in 6 cadavers) introduced via small individual incisions
of the otherwise intact scalp. The voltage–current relationship
remained linear for transcutaneous stimulation as well but the
slopes were strongly reduced (Fig. 5b; Pearson’s linear correlation;
Rsubcutaneous = 0.92 and Rtranscutaneous = 0.86; P < 0.001 in both
cases; n = 14 and 81 for transcutaneous and subcutaneous
conditions, respectively). Comparison of the current–electric field
relationships indicated that approximately 2 mA subcutaneously
applied current was sufficient to induce a 1-mV/mm field
maximum (Fig. 5c; Pearson’s linear correlation; R = 0.56; P <
0.001; n = 29). In contrast, the current vs. electric field slope was
decreased three-fold when current was applied to the scalp rather
than to the skull (Fig. 5c, d; Esubcutaneous(mV/mm) = 0.41 × I(mA)

amplitude increase for high-intensity ISP stimulation. Alpha-band filtered EEG signals are color coded based on the instantaneous ISP phase for better
visibility; blue and red colors denote stimulus trough (right-to-left currents) and peak (left-to-right currents), respectively. Gray sinusoids denote the ISP
stimulus epoch with an increasing–decreasing amplitude. b Phase modulation of the alpha amplitude by ISP stimulation for the entire session from the
same subject as shown in a, showing intensity-dependent alpha amplitude increase (mean across phases are tested in n = 45 trials against 0 mA condition,
P < 0.001 for 6 and 7.5 mA). Note the alternating phase modulation of the left and right hemisphere-derived EEG signals at 6 and 7.5 mA intensities. Color
maps show the phase-dependent median alpha amplitudes. c Population analysis for the left and right hemispheres, respectively, revealed an intensity-
dependent effect. Alpha amplitudes at stimulus peaks and troughs were generally unchanged for stimulus intensities below 4.5 mA. In response to anodal
currents in the same hemisphere, phasic modulation was significant at 4.5, 6, and 7.5 mA. In response to cathodal stimulation in the contralateral
hemisphere, significant effects were observed only at 7.5 mA (right hemisphere) or 6 and 7.5 mA (left hemisphere)

suggested
that
approximately 6 mA current applied to the scalp would be
needed to reach 1 mV/mm voltage gradient in the living brain
(Fig. 5d; Pearson’s linear correlation; R = 0.80; P < 0.001; n = 16).
Across all experiments in which scalp, skull, and epidural
stimulations were tested (n = 6), we could establish that 58 ± 7%
of the current applied through the scalp diffused through the soft
tissue surrounding the head. Another 16 ± 8% of the current was
attenuated by the resistance of the skull, whereas current spread
effectively in the brain, including the meninges, vasculature,
ventricles, gray matter, and white matter (Fig. 5e, f; 0.12 (IQR =
0.07–0.19) and 0.62 (IQR = 0.44–0.79) mV/mm/mA for transcu-
taneous vs. subcutaneous comparison; 0.61 (IQR = 0.49–0.80) and

supporting the view that the brain is an effective volume
conductor3. Skull thickness was a potential factor in attenuation
of the current spread, explaining some of the variability across
subjects (Fig. 5g; Supplementary Figure 8; Pearson’s linear
correlation; P = 0.008; R2adjusted = 0.046; n = 128 electric field
strength and skull thickness value pairs).
The experiments on the cadaver brains were performed from 3
to 8 days after death (Supplementary Table 1). Water density
measurements of brain specimens revealed that the postmortem
age had little effect on the hydration level of the brain
(Supplementary Figure 9a). However, previous papers reported
that the resistivity is increased in the postmortem skull and soft
tissues37,38. To mimic the effects of postmortem changes on our

 cadaver experiments, we simulated the effects of changing the
resistance of the soft tissue and examined the role of shunted
current by soft tissue (parallel resistance) and the current entering
through the skull (serial resistance). Our simulations showed that
the lower resistances of the live soft tissues shunt the scalp-
applied currents even more than in the cadavers (Supplementary
Figure 9b, c).
Overall, our measurements in human cadavers demonstrate
that a significant fraction of the scalp-applied current is lost due
to the shunting effects of the skin and soft tissue and the serial
resistance of the skull. Approximately three quarters of the
current was attenuated across the scalp and skull. These findings
were further supported by measuring the induced voltage fields
first in vivo, followed by identical measurements up to 5
postmortem days in chronically implanted rats (n = 3; Supple-
mentary Figure 9d).
Affecting human brain network activity by ISP. Our human
cadaver and in vivo rat measurements indicated that approxi-
mately 6 mA currents applied to the scalp are needed in humans
to effectively alter brain networks. To test this prediction, a
circular array of 12 stimulation electrodes (six on each side;
Fig. 5a) was placed around the head and an ISP protocol was
applied in 19 healthy human subjects. Each stimulation site
consisted of a 0.9% NaCl solution-soaked sponge square con-
nected to 2 × 3 cm copper mesh. Scalp EEG was monitored by a
2-site montage (P3 and P4 against reference Pz). In each session,
1-min long control recordings were obtained before and after the
stimulation session (12 min). To avoid onset and offset effects,
ISP stimulation consisted of a train of 1-Hz sinusoids with
increasing and decreasing intensity (0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 6, 4.5, 3,
1.5, 0 mA per cycle; Fig. 6a, b; Supplementary Figure 2b) for 12 s,
repeated 60 times for each subject. The low frequency (1 Hz)
stimulation allowed us to investigate the anodal–cathodal phase
modulation of the amplitude of the spontaneous EEG (repre-
sented mainly by the dominant alpha band activity) simulta-
neously in the left and right hemispheres. This approach exploits
the observation that TES can coherently affect the membrane
potential (Vm) of many similarly oriented neurons (Fig. 2) and
the one order of magnitude lower stimulation frequency com-
pared to the oscillation being observed reduces the possibility that
stimulation artifacts and their harmonics contaminate the

Fig. 8 Comparison of ISP and shuffled ISP stimulation on the EEG of human subjects. a Testing sequence of the experimental protocol. ISP stimulation used
the same arrangement as in Fig. 5. During shuffled ISP, adjacent stimulation electrodes were stimulated with opposite polarity. While shuffled ISP increases
local current flow in the scalp, the alternating directions of the induced electric fields at the focus area are expected to cancel, ideally resulting in a zero
current in the brain. b Group results shown separately for the left and right hemispheres. Six mA current ISP stimulation increased alpha power in both
hemispheres. Shuffled ISP exerted only a unilateral and weaker effect. Intensities at 2 mA were ineffective. Abdominal stimulation (6 mA ISP protocol) did
not exert a significant effect on alpha power (n = 809 epochs; power difference values for each conditions from 6 subjects, one-sample t-test with
Bonferroni correction). c Spectral power comparison between eyes open control and eyes closed control periods. Horizontal lines indicate significant
changes from the eyes open condition (P < 0.05; n = 125 epochs for the eyes open, 144, 117, 126, 127, 148 epochs for the consecutive eyes closed, and 211

 results4. The residual ISP artifacts were removed by an offline
subtraction of the stimulation-triggered moving average (Sup-
plementary Figure 1a). The artifact-removed signal preserved the
major features of the unstimulated control brain activity, as
demonstrated by the non-zero peaked cross-correlograms and the
weakly correlated instantaneous frequencies in the alpha band
between the two EEG channels (Supplementary Figure 1b, c).
TES phase modulation of the amplitude of alpha waves became
visible by eye on the filtered signal at high ISP intensities (6 and
7.5 mA; Fig. 6a, b; paired t-test with Bonferroni correction; P <
0.001 for 6 and 7.5 mA in both hemispheres; n = 45 trials). The
LFP modulation was present in both hemispheres and alternated
in phase, due to the shifting of the anodal–cathodal current
direction (compare blue and red epochs in Fig. 6a, b). For group
statistics, the mean alpha amplitudes near the stimulus peak
(−135° to −45°) and near the stimulus trough (45° to 135°) were
measured separately at P3 and P4 at each current intensity.
Significant modulation of the LFP amplitude by the TES phase
was observed at current intensities of 4.5, 6, and 7.5 mA at each
hemisphere when the preferred current direction was applied
(Fig. 6c, paired t-test with Bonferroni correction; left hemisphere
at TES trough: P = 0.006, <0.001 for 6 and 7.5 mA; left
hemisphere at TES peak: P = 0.01, <0.001, <0.001 for 4.5, 6,
7.5 mA; right hemisphere at TES peak: P < 0.001 at 7.5 mA; right
hemisphere TES trough: 0.01, <0.001, <0.001 for 4.5, 6, 7.5 mA;
n = 1025 trials for all conditions from 18 subjects. All intensities
were tested against the 0 mA condition).
Stimulation intensity of 4.5 mA or higher induced various self-
reported subjective effects, including tingling and slight burning
feeling of the skin in each subject. Subjective feeling of head-
movement (dizziness) and horizontally oscillating light in the
visual field at the frequency of the stimulation was often reported
even though the eyes were closed and testing was performed in
semi-darkness. Feeling of a moving noise source in the horizontal
plane at 1 Hz was also reported. Nearly all subjects also reported a
‘metallic taste’ in the mouth. All subjective effects were stronger at
the beginning of the stimulation session and attenuated (though
they did not disappear) by the end of the session. No post-
stimulation aftereffects were reported after any session. One
subject requested an early termination of the stimulation due to
dizziness and their data were excluded from the study.
In three of the subjects, we also used step currents of 1 Hz ISP
stimulation, instead of the intensity increasing–decreasing ramp.
The results of this experiment support those obtained by ramp
stimulation (Fig. 7a–f). Current intensity exceeding 4.5 mA
increased alpha band spectral amplitude (Fig. 7b–c; paired t-test
with Bonferroni correction; P < 0.001 for 7 and 9 mA vs. 0 mA; n
= 405–408 power values for each stimulus intensity), and brought
about stimulus phase-dependent amplitude modulation of the
alpha waves (Fig. 7d–f; two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; P
< 0.001 and 0.019 for 7 and 9 mA vs. 0 mA; n = 16, 10, 8, 18, 10,
and 12 modulation vector length). This experiment also showed
that the subjective decrease of the perceived sensory effects over
the course of the experiments cannot be attributed to changes in
alpha power since alpha power did not change between the first
and second halves of the experiment (Fig. 7g; paired t-test; P =
0.96, 0.79, 0.44, 0.44, 0.74, 0.11 for 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5 mA
intensities; n = 23 spectral amplitude pairs).
In a separate group of subjects (n = 6, Supplementary Table 4),
we examined whether the EEG changes could be accounted by
non-specific sensory stimulation or potential arousing effects of
TES. We used current steps (tACS) of 1 Hz ISP stimulation (2 or
6 mA for 5 min with 1-min rest periods; Fig. 8a). To test for the
effects of peripheral sensory stimulation, we interleaved the ISP
stimulation epochs with a similar protocol, where the adjacent
electrode pairs were stimulated with opposite polarity (‘shuffled
ISP’ protocol—first pair received an L–R direction current pulse,
second one received an R–L, third one an L–R, and so on; Fig. 8a).
Because of the alternating direction of the induced electric fields
with the shuffled ISP, the summed effect in neurons was expected
to be close to zero. The results with the regular ISP protocol
confirmed the hemisphere-specific, stimulation phase-induced
modulation of alpha waves (Fig. 8b; Supplementary Figure 10;
one-sample t-test with Bonferroni correction; P < 0.005 for L–R
and R–L direction 6 mA ISP in both hemispheres; n = 809 power
difference values). In contrast, the shuffled ISP induced only
minor physiological effects on EEG activity (Fig. 8b; one-sample
t-test with Bonferroni correction; P < 0.005 for L–R 6 mA
shuffled ISP in left hemisphere; n = 809 power difference values).
Stimulus intensity at 2 mA failed to induce any detectable changes
(ISP or shuffled ISP; one-sample t-test with Bonferroni correc-
tion; P = 0.36, 1.06, 2.22, and 1.45; n = 809 power difference
values). As an additional control for potential arousal effects, the
same subjects were also tested with the same ISP protocol but
with the stimulation electrodes placed on the abdominal wall
(Fig. 8a). No hemisphere-specific, stimulation phase-induced
modulation of alpha waves was observed in the peripheral control
experiment (Fig. 8b; 6 mA abdominal; one-sample t-test with
Bonferroni correction; P = 0.41, 0.39, 1.68, and 1.18; n = 809
power difference values).
The self-reported subjective effects in this last experiment,
using the ISP protocol with step increase of tACS, were similar to
those observed with the ramp stimulation (Supplementary
Table 4). In contrast, under the shuffled or the abdominal ISP
protocol no subject reported phosphenes, vestibular effects, or
metallic taste. On the other hand, each subject judged that the
feeling of skin ‘burning’ was stronger under the shuffled ISP
protocol. No post-stimulation aftereffects were reported by any
subject.
Finally, we asked whether the ISP or shuffled ISP stimulation
exerted a long-lasting blocking effect on occipital alpha oscilla-
tions. Alpha dominance of the EEG was present after each
stimulation period (eyes closed) and each period was significantly
different from the control pre-stimulation eyes open condition
(Fig. 8c; Mann–Whitney U-test with Bonferroni correction; P <
0.05; n = 125–148 spectral power values for each of the 500
discrete frequencies). Some periods also showed significant
increase in beta power (16–28 Hz) and decreased power in the
delta (<4 Hz) band compared to the eyes open condition. None of
the post-stimulation periods were different from the pre-
stimulation eyes closed control condition. Overall, these experi-
ments showed that ISP stimulation at sufficient stimulus intensity
(4.5–6 mA) can bring about stimulus phase-dependent amplitude
modulation of the EEG, an effect which cannot be attributed to
peripheral sensory or arousal effects.
Discussion
Using in vivo experiments in rodents and high-density intracer-
ebral recordings in human cadaver brains, we found that scalp-
applied currents were halved by the skin and subcutaneous soft
tissue and further attenuated by the skull by 16%. To reduce the
scalp stimulation side effects and enable recording of brain
activity during stimulation, we designed an ISP stimulation
method that allowed injection of higher current intensities into
the brain compared to conventional tACS and transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS) approaches, while keeping the
cumulative charge density on the scalp surface and sensation
relatively low. The spatial specificity of the ISP method was
demonstrated by hemisphere-specific activation of single neurons
in rats. Finally, we show that sufficiently strong induced fields can

 directly and instantaneously affect brain networks in healthy
subjects.
Neuronal excitability is largely determined by ionic con-
ductances brought about by neurotransmitter-induced post-
synaptic potentials. However, neurons can also sense electric
fields directly1–3,28,39. In principle, the effectiveness of the
externally applied field depends on a variety of factors including
neuronal density and geometry, alignment of dendrites and axons
relative to the induced field, type and distribution of ion channels
in the neurons, degree of myelination, and density of glia, which
can affect the electric shunting effect of the extracellular space.
These factors can change between brain regions and might vary
across species and their potential significance must be addressed
experimentally. The additive nature of the two polarizing
mechanisms (synapse-mediated and ephaptic) can be exploited to
influence subthreshold membrane potentials and spiking1. When
a neuron is about to emit a spike, even a weak electric field can
bias spike threshold. In vitro experiments have shown that cou-
pling an oscillatory field to intracellularly generated oscillation
can be effective with as small as 0.2 mV/mm gradient40 and 1
mV/mm can induce measurable subthreshold Vm effects and
affected timing of action potentials39. Whether such weak stimuli,
applied acutely or chronically, can have beneficial or deleterious
effects on brain function can only be determined by targeted
recordings and additional behavioral measures. To place such
weak forced fields into perspective, voltage gradients of >4 mV/
mm are brought about by hippocampal theta oscillations across
the CA1 pyramidal layer and >15 mV/mm fields are induced by
sharp waves1. However, to exert a reproducible and instantaneous
impact on local networks by forced fields, the discharge of at least
a fraction of neurons with common targets should be temporally
coordinated. Our in vivo intracellular recordings have revealed
that electric fields >1 mV/mm were needed to exert measurable
effects on spikes and subthreshold Vm, but several times larger
currents were required to measurably affect the associated net-
work rhythms1,4,6,8,12,41. This difference may be explained by the
competition between the applied fields and the strong influence of
endogenous network patterns.
Given the complex paths of current spread in the brain42 and
the importance of neuronal geometry in sensing fields43, the
absence of an effect in any experiment cannot be taken as evi-
dence for absence of effects on a few neurons. Yet, it is also
important to emphasize that the requirements of affecting spike
threshold of some neurons occasionally in wide areas of the brain
vs. consistently biasing activity of neuronal circuits are different.
We focused our efforts on establishing a current intensity level
required to reliably affect local networks in the intact brain. The
findings demonstrate that to consistently affect spikes and local
networks, sufficient magnitude of charges has to be applied to the
scalp to achieve >1 mV/mm voltage gradient44. In our rodent
experiments, more neurons were excited than suppressed by
alternating current simulation, and the depolarizing fields were
more effective than hyperpolarizing fields. These findings illus-
trate that externally applied alternating fields bring about a
dominant excitatory gain. We emphasize though that our results
cannot rule out the potential impact of long-lasting (minutes to
hours) weak electric fields on behavior by yet unidentified
mechanisms45.
Although computational methods have become increasingly
sophisticated over the years17,28,35, experimental data are needed
to justify the modeling assumptions. Subdural measurements in
implanted patients46 can be useful but limited for estimating the
currents necessary to bias spiking because they estimate fields
tangentially to the cortical surface, whereas the largest voltage
gradients are oriented orthogonal to the cortical surface44. Using
scalp, cranial, and epidural stimulation electrodes and multiple
recording electrodes, we quantified the 3-D spread of electric
fields in both rodents and human cadavers. Our findings confirm
the largely ohmic nature of current spread in the brain34, skull,
and the surrounding soft tissue35. The scalp, subcutaneous tissue,
and muscles function as an effective shunt, resulting in at least
50% reduction of applied current intensity. The serial resistance
of the skull further reduces the current flow by another 10–25%,
depending on the thickness of the skull47. Given the importance
of these attenuating factors, the amount of soft tissue, hair, and
skull thickness should be taken into account in estimating the
effective current reaching the brain35, and variation of these
factors may explain the large individual variability of the TES-
induced effects14,46,48.
In TES practice, currents larger than 2 mA are avoided because
higher intensities are associated with skin sensation, phosphenes,
and other side effects7,9,49. Our intracellular and extracellular
measurements in rats, along with previously published data4,6
and models17,41, suggest that 1 mV/mm is needed to affect neu-
ronal firing consistently and even larger strengths may be needed
to phase-entrain brain rhythms to arbitrary stimulus frequencies.
In our cadaver experiments, we found that scalp-applied currents
should exceed 4–6 mA to achieve 1 mV/mm voltage gradient in
brain tissue but direct comparison with in vivo brain measure-
ments are not available. Electric conductivity of the postmortem
tissue may change after death. However, our in vivo vs. post-
mortem comparison in rats demonstrated that in the intact head,
actually larger currents are needed to achieve voltage gradients
comparable to those of the cadaver experiments, possibly due to
the stronger shunting effect of the better hydrated in vivo tissue38.
To reduce scalp sensation or other side effects31,41 and to
increase the direct effects of TES on brain activity7,9–14, novel
approaches are needed18. Our ISP method exploits the time-
integrating property of the neuronal membrane (i.e., the mem-
brane time constant of neurons is ~10 ms), by applying brief and
rapidly rotating fields. Using the ISP protocol, the strongest
transmembrane charge builds up where successively induced
electric fields (‘beams’) intersect, although in the human brain the
anisotropy brought about the cortical gyri and ventricles should
be taken into consideration. The more ‘beams’ are used, the
smaller the adverse effects on other areas. Using just three
rotating dipoles in rats, we demonstrated a proof of principle for
the focusing effect of ISP by confining the ISP effect to largely one
hemisphere. In addition, when adjacent electrodes were stimu-
lated with opposite polarity in human experiments (shuffled ISP),
no reliable brain responses were detected, even though skin
sensation side effects increased. The latter effect may be explained
by the stronger current density induced by the opposite polarity
of neighboring sites.
An experimental advantage of the ISP technique is that high
frequency pulses do not saturate recording amplifiers. This fea-
ture allowed us to measure the physiological effects of scalp sti-
mulation in human subjects. Instead of focusing on brain
rhythm-entrainment effects15,50, in which residual artifacts are
notoriously difficult to eliminate15,23, we examined how the
amplitude of the spontaneous LFP was biased by the slowly
changing forced fields4. This method is similar to using tDCS at
multiple current levels, where the additive/subtractive effect of the
applied field can be probed on the amplitude of native network
patterns4. We have verified the validity of this approach pre-
viously in rodents, using both LFP and unit firing4. In support of
the estimated voltage gradients from the cadaver experiments and
the ‘minimum’ fields (~1 mV/mm) in rodents to affect network
activity, we found that >4.5 mA currents were required to reliably
bias the amplitude of occipital alpha waves. While we designed
our experiments to maximize the stimulation effects on the
parietal–occipital region where alpha waves are of largest

 amplitude, we cannot exclude the possibility that an improved
configuration of stimulation sites could reduce the minimum
effective current somewhat further in future studies.
In our human experiments, we used six pairs of scalp stimu-
lation electrodes, reducing the required local momentary current
by six-fold. Still, the effective intensities needed to directly bias
intracerebral neuronal activity induced adverse skin effects and
vestibular reactions. An obvious next step in advancing the ISP
technique is to increase the number of intersecting dipoles gen-
erated by pairs of stimulating electrodes. For example, using a
montage of 32 electrodes with highly conductive coupling to the
skin, a large number of dipoles can be formed to create a cir-
cumscribed 3-D intersectional focus or target two or more brain
structures while reducing the locally applied currents, potentially
below the skin sensation threshold. Combining ‘ground truth’
measurements from the human cadaver brain with computational
models of the head can lead to a rationale design of focused
electric activation of brain structures without adverse and per-
ceivable peripheral effects.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that affecting neuronal circuits
directly and instantaneously in the human brain requires higher
intensity currents than used in conventional TES experiments.
Implicitly, our results also suggest that behavioral and cognitive
effects reported in previous tACS studies have likely been
achieved by indirect mechanisms on brain activity, which needs
to be explored in detail. To achieve sufficient magnitudes of
intracranial fields without direct peripheral side effects, novel
methods will be required.
Methods
Ethical permissions. The experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of New York University Medical Center IACUC (pro-
tocol number: 160926–01), the Ethical Committee for Animal Research (ethical
permission numbers: XIV/471/2012 and XIV/218/2016), and the Ethical Com-
mittee for Human Research (ethical permission numbers: 98/2013 and 164/2014,
for the measurements on cadavers and healthy subjects, respectively) at the Albert
Szent-Györgyi Medical and Pharmaceutical Center of the University of Szeged in
accordance with European Union guidelines (2003/65/CE).
Experiments on rats. A total of 16 female, 3 male Long-Evans rats (350–450 g,
10–16 weeks old) and 8 male Wistar rats (250–450 g, 8–12 weeks old) were
implanted with custom-made recording and stimulating electrodes under urethane
anesthesia (1.3–1.5 g/kg, intraperitoneal injection) for the extracellular and the
whole-cell patch clamp recording experiments, respectively. Sample size for each
experiment was estimated on the basis of anticipated inter-animal neurophysio-
logical variability and the expected high success rate of the experiments in terms of
the number of recorded neurons and data quality based on our previous studies.
No rats were excluded from the analysis. Each animal served as its own control, no
randomization or blinding was employed. Rats were kept on a regular 12 h–12 h
light–dark cycle and housed in pairs before implantation. No prior experimenta-
tion had been performed on these rats. After anesthesia induction, atropine (0.05
mg/kg, s.c.) was administered to reduce salivation, and the rectal temperature was
kept constant at 36–37 °C with a DC temperature controller (TMP-5b; Supertech,
Pécs, Hungary). Stages of anesthesia were maintained by confirming the lack of
vibrissae movements and nociceptive reflex. Skin of the head was shaved and the
remaining fur was completely removed by using depilatory cream.
Recording intracerebral electric fields in anesthetized rats. To record the
stimulus-induced intracerebral electric fields, the skin was retracted after a med-
iosagittal incision, and the bone surface was cleaned and dried as described
before51. Two strips of three custom-molded silicon pockets (2-by-2-by-1 mm, 4
mm2 surface area, 1.2 mm spacing) were glued onto the temporal bone bilaterally,
and a single pocket above the prefrontal bone (2 mm anterior from bregma in the
midline) using cyano-acrylic glue. Pockets were filled with conductive paste (Super
Visc, Brain Products, Germany) and then sealed with silicon. An Ag/AgCl refer-
ence electrode was placed in the subcutaneous space behind the neck. Thirty holes
(0.5 mm diameter) were drilled in the skull and a custom-made 6 × 5 recording
electrode matrix was inserted into the brain 3 mm deep below the brain surface
(Fig. 1a). The spacing between the individual electrodes was 2, 1.7, 2.2, 1.7, and 2
mm in the x axis and 2 mm in the y axis. Each recording electrode was made by a
polyurethane-insulated, copper–nickel wire (50 µm diameter) inserted into a sup-
porting polyimide tube (70 µm interior diameter, 86 µm outside diameter).
Subcutaneous tACS was performed in voltage controlled mode, generated by an
STG4008–16mA (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen). To monitor the applied
current, a 100 Ω resistor was placed in series with the stimulating electrodes and
the voltage drop were measured across the resistor by an isolation amplifier circuit
to preserve the ground-independent stimulation configuration. The prefrontal
electrode was used as an anode and the lateral ones served as cathodes. Varying
frequencies (10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) at 3 V were delivered
through the stimulating electrodes paired in various configurations. Recorded
signals (n = 30 channels) were amplified (10× gain) and stored after digitization at
20 kHz sampling rate per channel (RHD2000 Evaluation System, Intan
Technologies, Los Angeles).
Measuring the spatial selectivity of focused ISP in vivo. Two custom-designed
(AutoCad, San Rafael, CA, USA) stimulation strips were 3-D printed (Form 1+,
Formlabs, Somerville, MA, USA) and glued bilaterally on the surfaces of the
temporal bones of the rats by cyano-acrylic glue (Loctite, Henkel). Each of the two
symmetric strips (width 13 mm, height 3.3 mm, and wall thickness 0.7 mm) con-
sisted of five individual pockets which were separated from each other by 3.7, 2.2,
2.2, and 3.7 mm (Fig. 2b), and their medial surfaces were resembling the temporal
bone curvature of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data-based 3D model of a
rat skull. The middle pockets were positioned at 5.16 mm posterior from bregma.
The pockets were filled with conductive paste through filling holes left open at the
top (Super Visc, Brain Products, Germany) and then sealed with silicon. Cranio-
tomies were drilled (2.2 mm diameter) and two silicon probes (Buzsaki32-H32;
NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) were implanted at 5.16 mm posterior from
bregma and 4 mm lateral of the midline, in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.
The hole around the probes was filled with non-conductive silicon (Dow Corning®,
Midland, MI, USA). Proper locations of the electrodes were confirmed by the
characteristic electrophysiological landmarks of the broadband signal at the pyr-
amidal layer of CA1. ISP stimulation was performed in a voltage-controlled mode
using phototransistor-based custom-made electronics described below.
Comparing the effect of TES and ISP stimulation. To compare the effects of ISP
and DC stimulation in rats, the same surgery procedure was applied but the
stimulation was performed in current-controlled mode (stimulus intensity 200 µA)
using the high-speed analog switch-based circuits described below. The recorded
signals (n = 64 channels) were amplified (400× gain) and stored after digitization at
20 kHz sampling rate per channel (KJE-1001, Amplipex, Szeged, Hungary). We
repeated the same measurements on one awake, freely moving animal4.
Comparing transcutaneous and subcutaneous stimulation. For transcutaneous
electrical stimulations, a pair of silicon single-pocket electrodes filled with con-
ductive EEG gel was glued on both sides of the head of the rats, as described above
(Fig. 1c). Small incision on the scalp was then made for craniotomy after sub-
cutaneous lidocaine injections. Small craniotomy was drilled (1.2 mm diameter)
and a silicon probe (Buzsaki32-H32; NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was
inserted in the axis of the stimulating electrodes at 3 mm posterior from bregma
and 2 mm lateral of the midline, into the CA1 region of the hippocampus. A 50-µm
insulated wire electrode (California Fine Wire, Grover Beach, CA, USA) was
attached 1.2 mm away from the fourth shank serving as a reference electrode. The
hole around the probe was filled in with silicon (Dow Corning®, Midland, MI,
USA).
After the transcutaneous stimulation, the silicon probe was removed and the
skin was retracted and another set of silicon pocket electrodes were attached onto
the temporal bone, as described above. The silicon probe was inserted again at
almost the same location (2.8 mm posterior from bregma and 2 mm lateral of the
midline).
Varying frequencies (10, 100, and 1000 Hz) at varying amplitudes (10, 20, 50,
100, and 200 µA) were used for both settings in current-controlled mode
(STG4002; Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany).
The recorded signals (n = 32 channels) were amplified (400× gain) and stored
after digitization at 20 kHz sampling rate per channel (KJE-1001, Amplipex,
Szeged, Hungary).
Measuring the effect of postmortem age. Rats were implanted with a pair of
silicon pocket electrodes as described above. Twelve holes (0.5 mm diameter) were
drilled in the skull and a custom-made 6 × 2 recording electrode matrix was
inserted into the brain. The spacing between the individual electrodes was 2, 1.7,
2.2, 1.7, and 2 mm in the x axis and 2 mm in the y axis. The electrode matrix was
inserted at 3 mm depth in the brain and the craniotomies were filled with silicon
(Dow Corning®, Midland, MI, USA). Once the silicon dried, the whole skull was
covered by dental cement (Duracryl™ Plus, Spofa Dental, Jičín, Czechia) and the
skin was closed by sutures to restore its conductive integrity. Subcutaneous tACS
was performed in voltage-controlled mode using various stimulation parameters as
described above (STG4002; Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany).
After the in vivo measurement, the rats were euthanized by sodium
pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection). The corpses were kept at 4 °C
after death in plastic bags to prevent desiccation. Subcutaneous tACS and
recordings were repeated on postmortem day 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. In one case, the

 implantation was done 5 days after the euthanasia, which resulted in qualitatively
and quantitatively similar results (data not shown).
In vivo whole-cell patch clamp recordings. A pair of silicon pocket electrodes
filled with conductive EEG gel were glued bilaterally on the skin or on the temporal
bone of rats for transcutaneous and subcutaneous stimulation, respectively, simi-
larly to extracellular recording experiments (Fig. 1c). A small craniotomy (~2 mm
diameter) was made 5.0 mm posterior from the bregma, 4.0 mm lateral of the
midline. Patch-pipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (GC150TF-10;
Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) and their tip resistance were 5–7 MΩ
when filled with an intracellular solution: (in mM) 135 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 10
Na2-phosphocreatine, 4 KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, and 0.3 GTP-Na3 (pH = 7.25, 290
mOsm). Liquid junction potential calculated as +18.6 mV was offline-
compensated. The patch-pipettes attached to a fine stepper motor manipulator
were lowered perpendicularly and blind in vivo whole-cell recordings from cortical
neurons (0.5–1.3 mm from the pia) were obtained as previously described52.
Recordings were performed using an EPC10 USB amplifier (HEKA Elektronik,
Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) with PATCHMASTER software (ver. 2.901 HEKA
Elektronik). Signals were filtered at 3 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz. The pipette
capacitance, membrane capacitance, and series resistance were compensated. If
series resistance varied more than 20% or increased above 50 MΩ, the data were
discarded. Isolated direct constant current stimuli (~ ±800 µA) were delivered via a
multifunction stimulator (STG4002; Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Ger-
many). After the whole-cell transmembrane potential recordings, the recorded
neurons were detached from the pipette with retraction and positive pressures.
After retraction, the artifacts of the same set of electrical stimuli applied during the
whole-cell recordings were recorded extracellularly. The recorded artifacts were
subtracted from intracellularly recorded potentials to recover the true transmem-
brane potentials25. Finally, a 4-shank 32-channel silicon probe (Buzsaki32-H32;
NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was inserted in the vicinity of the recorded
neuron to record extracellular electrical gradients in response to the same stimu-
lation as during intracellular recordings. The extracellular recordings were per-
formed at 20 kHz sampling rate using a KJE-1001 amplifier (Amplipex, Szeged,
Hungary).
Measurements on human cadavers. Recordings were performed at the Depart-
ment of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Szeged. Medical history of
cadavers was consulted in advance and only those with no known brain disorder
were selected for measurements. The corpses were kept at 4 °C after death in plastic
bags until autopsy to prevent desiccation. The autopsy theater temperature was 22 °
C. The routine medical autopsy procedure was done on the same day as experi-
mental measurements. The sample size required (number of cadavers and
recording sessions) was extrapolated from the results of animal studies. There was
no blinding or randomization employed. No cadaver was excluded from the
analysis.
Recording tACS-induced intracerebral electric fields. The scalp was cut along
the coronal plane connecting the mastoids. The anterior and posterior halves of the
scalp were retracted forward and backward, respectively, until the supraorbital
ridge and the occipital protuberance was revealed. The temporal muscles and soft
tissue were also removed. After the skull was cleaned, the head was fixed in a
custom-made acrylic glass frame (Supplementary Figure 3). The top of the skull
was pushed against the acrylic frame as close as possible. Four stainless-steel screw
bars (6 mm diameter, 10 cm length) held the head steady on each side. One end of
the screw bar was attached to the tower by a hexagonal nut, the other end held a
rubber ring (3 cm diameter) against the skull. Once the head was positioned, the
positions of the 36 penetration holes were marked by an ink-filled needle through
the pre-made hole-matrix of the plexiglass back panel. The frame was removed and
holes were drilled (1.2 mm diameter) and rinsed by physiologic saline. The frame
was placed back to its original position, and the head was repositioned by the screw
bars. Four or seven pairs of stimulation electrodes (Ag/AgCl EEG electrodes, 10
mm diameter, Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark) were placed between the rubber
rings and the skull surface with conductive paste (Ten20, D.O. Weaver, Aurora,
CO, USA). Custom-made multiple-site electrodes were prepared as follows: three
to seven holes were drilled on the outer surface of a translucent polyimide tube
(724 μm internal diameter, 775 μm outside diameter). Three to seven 127-μm
diameter, polyurethane-insulated, copper–nickel wires were threaded into the
polyimide tube through these holes space 1 cm from each other. The wires were
secured by a drop of cyano-acrylic glue at the side-holes of the polyimide tube and
the other end of it was soldered to a connector socket. The tubes were backfilled
with epoxy glue to increase stiffness. Once the epoxy dried, the wires were cut back
at the surface of the polyimide tube, and the tip of the tube was sharpened.
Impedances of the contact sites varied between 50 and 300 kΩ at 1 kHz. Electrodes
were inserted into the brain through the previously drilled skull holes and the
matching plexiglass matrix while rotating continuously, to preserve parallel
alignment.
A needle was inserted through the skull above the prefrontal cortex and served
as reference electrode. Physiologic saline solution (2–5 ml) was injected through the
same hole to refill the cerebrospinal fluid lost during the drilling procedure.
Recording electrodes made a watertight seal in the skull holes, thus further leakage
was not significant. The chest wall was used as grounding. Subcutaneous
(electrodes placed on the skull surface) alternating and direct current stimulation
was performed using stimulation signals generated by either an STG 4008–16 mA
(Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen) or an NI 6343 board (National Instruments)
with precision isolation amplifier circuits. The floating (cadaver) side of the
isolation amplifiers were powered using two 9-V batteries for each stimulator pair.
To monitor the applied current, a 100-Ω resistor was placed in series with the
stimulating electrodes and the voltage drop across the resistor was measured by an
isolation amplifier circuit. The stimulating electrodes of the two sides were paired
using different parallel or diagonal arrangements. Sinusoid stimuli with varying
intensities (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 V) at 10 Hz and varying frequencies (5, 20, 50, 100,
200, 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz) at 5 V were used for at least 200 cycles, each. To
mimic the effect of increasing electrode sizes, multiple stimulating electrodes were
coupled together. In some cases, an additional stimulation electrode was placed in
the midline of the forehead, and used against a selected lateral electrode to achieve
a fronto-lateral stimulation configuration. The recorded signals (n = 198 channels)
were amplified (10× gain) and stored after digitization at 1.6 kHz sampling rate per
channel by a custom-designed circuit (for DC coupled recordings) or at 20 kHz
sampling rate per channel by another custom-designed recoding system based on
the RHD2000 Evaluation System (for AC coupled recordings, 0.1–6 kHz
bandwidth, Intan Technologies, Los Angeles, CA, USA).
Recording tDCS-induced intracerebral electric fields. Instead of the above-
mentioned electrode matrix, six custom-made single contact Ag/AgCl electrodes
were introduced in the fourth coronal plane in 2 cadavers. A silver wire (400 µm
diameter) was inserted into a translucent polyimide tube. The contact sites were
cleaned by scratching with a razor blade and then immersed into NaOCl (42 g/l)
for 16 h. The same recording system was used to acquire signals (10× gain, 1.6 kHz
sampling rate per channel). All stimulating electrode pairs were active simulta-
neously and anodal or cathodal stimulation was applied for 50–50 s (5 V intensity).
Measuring the shunting effect of the skin and skull. Instead of retracting the
skin, four or six 5-mm long incisions (15 mm apart from each other) were made on
both sides of the sagittal suture in the coronal plane, connecting one mastoid with
the other. To prevent soft tissue damage, the drilling head was used through a
metal tube (1.3 mm diameter) and four holes were made. Then stimulation elec-
trodes (n = 4, Ag/AgCl, Ambu, Copenhagen, Denmark) were attached to the skin
by conductive paste (Ten20, D.O. Weaver, Aurora, CO, USA). Four or six custom-
made 7 contact site recording electrodes were inserted into the brain, transcuta-
neous alternating current stimulation was performed, as described above. The
recorded signals (n = 28 or 42 channels) were amplified (10× gain) and stored after
digitization at 15 kHz sampling rate per channel (RHD2000 Evaluation System,
Intan Technologies, Los Angeles, CA, USA). After the skin measurements, the skin
incisions were carefully connected and the scalp was removed while the recording
electrodes were kept in place. The stimulating electrodes were attached to the skull
surface and the same stimulation protocol was applied. In separate experiments, to
compare the effect of subcutaneous stimulation to intracranial stimulations, in
some cases additional stimulating electrodes were placed intracranially, in between
the subcutaneous electrodes as follows: the additional skull holes were drilled with
incrementally increasing (2, 4 and 8 mm) drill-bit sizes, and externally threaded,
hollow plastic dowels (15 mm long, 8 mm diameter, Hettich Furntech, Germany)
were introduced in the holes to form an electrical isolation toward the skull. Sponge
electrodes with the encapsulated Ag/AgCl plates, soaked in physiologic saline, were
glued to the tip of screws, and introduced into the plastic dowels to touch the brain
surface.
Registering the anthropometric data of the cadavers. At the end of the mea-
surements, the cranium was opened with an oscillating saw in the line of the
stimulating electrodes. After removing the skull cap, the brain was also removed.
Anthropometric data of the skull was measured (circumference, sagittal, horizontal,
vertical distance, and skull thickness below the stimulating electrodes). After the
brain was examined by the pathologist, a 5-g piece of the occipital lobe was
removed to measure the water content of the brain tissue by desiccation. As
reference, hydration value of living tissue was taken from reference53.
Measurements on human subjects. Human transcutaneous stimulation and
recording experiments were performed on healthy subjects (all males, age = 21–66
years). Subjects with short hair were preferably selected, thus including only males
was incidental. All subjects gave their informed consent to the experiments. Each
subject served as his/her own control; no randomization or blinding was used.
Before performing the ISP stimulation protocol, each subject was briefly
exposed to a few seconds of 1 Hz constant current stimulation with increasing
intensities (1, 2, 4, and 8 mA) to familiarize them with the expectable subjective
experience during the ISP protocol, and to test if any adverse effects are present.
The intensity was increased to the next level only if the previous intensity was
reported as being well tolerable. In addition to the well documented tingling,
burning feeling of the skin and perception of phosphenes11, stimulus intensities
above 4.5 mA stimulation induced feeling of horizontal head-movements and
horizontal oscillation of the visual and auditory fields at the frequency of the

 stimulation. All subjective effects were stronger at the beginning of the stimulation
and attenuated during the course of stimulation. None of these are considered
Serious Adverse Effect or Event by the US Food and Drug Administration54. No
aftereffects were reported after any session. Phosphenes were likely induced by
current spread through the orbits, whereas vestibular and auditory effects were
likely due to the spread of currents through the ear canals.
Considerations of TES effects on human subjects. There are no accepted
guidelines about the current limit of either tDCS or tACS24,49,54. The main reason
for this is the lack of reliable information about the induced fields in the human
brain, and this is what we supply in our cadaver studies. Most TES studies use <2
mA, mainly because this is the threshold where peripheral sensation and phos-
phenes are typically detected. Other related measures include (1) current density
(in A/m2) at the electrode calculated by taking the applied current to a given
electrode and dividing by electrode area and (2) stimulation charge (in Coulombs,
C) determined by multiplying current by duration. Since the adverse and risk
effects of stimulation are related to current density and duration of stimulation (i.e.,
the total charge or ‘dose’), 1 mA for 10 min, 2 mA for 5 min, and 10 mA for 1 min
are considered equivalent from the perspective of charge54, yet these three cate-
gories may not be equivalent for subjective side effects or instantaneous direct brain
effects. Direct stimulation of the brain via subdural electrodes using 1 ms pulses of
5 mA intensity for several seconds considered to be safe55. The brain-penetrating
currents used in our studies remained well below these widely accepted values. One
of 19 subjects in the ramp stimulation experiments (Fig. 5) requested to terminate
ISP stimulation because of feeling dizzy. For the experiments shown in Fig. 6, we
recruited 7 subjects (3 subjects overlapped with the experiments shown in Fig. 5
but were tested several weeks apart). In one of them, the instability of the electrodes
was only discovered after the experiments and the results from this subject could
not be analyzed due to excessive artifacts.
Stimulation methods. Stimulating sponge electrodes for ISP were prepared from a
2 × 3 × 1.5 cm sponge glued to a 2 × 3 cm copper mesh, and glued to a rubber
washer with the sponges inside, keeping approximately 2.5 cm distance between
sponges. The rubber washer with the 12 electrodes was soaked in 0.9% saline
solution and tightened gently around the head. Conductivity was further improved
by putting electrode gel (SuperVisc, EasyCap GmBH, Germany) between the wet
sponges and the skin. For abdominal ISP stimulation, the same sponge electrodes
were placed around the trunk.
Modeling of current-induced fields. To model the effect of soft-tissue resistivity
on intracerebral electric fields, a finite element method model was constructed, and
the theoretical values of the electric field inside the brain were calculated for
different conditions using Comsol Multiphysics (Comsol, Burlington, MA, USA).
Concentric spheres simulated the scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain
(Supplementary Figure 9b). Conductivity values were set to 0.465, 0.015, 1.65, 0.3 s/
m, respectively17,35. The dimensions of each layer were set to match one of the
cadaver’s anthropometric data (8, 5, and 2 mm thicknesses for the skin, skull, and
cerebrospinal fluid, respectively, while the brain diameter was set to 142.6 mm).
Two virtual stimulating electrodes attached to each side of the head were modeled
as conductors of 1 cm2 with the conductivity of copper (5×107 s/m). Induced
electric fields were calculated inside the model brain with a virtual 5 × 6 electrodes
array, mimicking the experimental setup. Maxwell’s equations were solved within
an adaptive mesh of 366619 elements, using a linear solver and a relative tolerance
of 1e−6. The effect of skin and soft tissue resistivity change on electric fields was
similar to those reported in earlier publications investigating postmortem resis-
tance changes of soft tissues and muscle37,38.
We used a leaky-integrate and fire neuron model to visualize the ISP principle.
Extracellular electric fields were derived from in vivo tACS measurements using 1
kHz sinusoid stimuli in the same arrangement as shown on Fig. 1a, but using
epidural stimulation with screw electrodes. The directionless electric field
intensities (35 mV/mm peak intensity) at each point were converted to
intracellularly injected current values by multiplying with a factor (4.5 nA/mV/
mm) to mimic transmembrane currents. A dimensionless leaky-integrate and fire
neuron model was established in Matlab based on ref. 31. Parameters were set as
the following: temporal constant of the membrane = 10 ms; resting membrane
potential = −70 mV; membrane resistance = 1 MΩ; spiking threshold = −54 mV;
spike peak potential = 20 mV; repolarization level = −80 mV. Extracellular electric
field duration = 0.5 ms. The effects of three different magnitude current injections
on the firing rate were demonstrated by the leaky-integrate and fire neuron model
is illustrated in Fig. 2a.
Electronic circuit of ISP stimulation. For the ISP stimulation approach, both
positive and negative leads of the stimulus generators were connected to 12–12
TLP52-4 phototransistors (Toshiba, Japan). Bidirectional, ground-independent
conductivity was achieved the following way. Two phototransistors were serially
coupled through their emitter and collector, and the input signal from the wave-
form generator was fed into both the emitter and the collector end of the transistor
doublet, through two Schottky-diodes, which allowed current flow only to the
appropriate member of the doublet, depending on the polarity of the signal. The
common segment of diode, the doublet, was connected to a stimulation electrode
on the head. The same circuit was constructed for the other pole of the signal as
well. Common driver signal to the infrared emitting diode sides opened all four
transistors, but due to the diodes two of them were always floating, while the other
two closed the circuit through the head (Supplementary Figure 1a). Six such cir-
cuits were used for the six electrode pairs, forming six quadruplets (blocks) of
transistors. In rats, only three pairs were used. Blocks were activated in a pseu-
dorandom order by transistor–transistor logic (TTL) pulses generated by a
CD74HC4017 Decade counter (Texas Instruments, USA), driven by a 100-kHz
TTL generator (ADG3051C, Tektronix, USA).
In sessions employing variable ISP intensities in human subjects, the
phototransistors were replaced with ADG412 high-speed analog switches (Analog
Devices, Norwood, MA, USA) and the control TTL signals were generated by a
PIC18F4525 (Microchip, Chandler, AZ, USA) microcontroller and isolated by
ADuM1400 (Analog Devices) digital isolators. This circuit allowed the unrestricted
flexible assignment of stimulus polarities to the electrodes. This latter circuitry was
also used for the experiments on rats when we compared the spatial effect of ISP
and TES pulses.
EEG recording during ISP stimulation. EEG scalp recordings were performed by a
16-channel V-Amp amplifier and ActiCap BP active electrodes (Brain Products
GmBH, Germany). Impedances were measured online and adjusted to remain
below 20 kΩ by applying electrode gel. Electrodes were placed according to the
International 10/20 electrode scheme. The broad dynamic range of the active
electrodes, and their buffering capacity allowed the low-noise transmission of EEG
signals and stimulus artifacts without on-head amplification. To prevent the
saturation of the amplifier, the output range of the active electrodes was matched to
the input range of the EEG amplifier through custom-made voltage dividers.
Data processing. The recorded data were analyzed by custom-written scripts in
MATLAB (MathWorks, USA). Single unit analyses were performed on the time
series of semi-automatically clustered and manually refined unit clusters of
extracellular action potential waveforms, as described earlier (PHY56,57). Only well
isolated single units were used in the analysis. Units were categorized as putative
pyramidal cells or interneurons based on their physiological properties.
To measure the electric field in cadavers and rats, 500 sinus cycles were
averaged for each condition and then the peak-to-peak amplitude was measured
for each channel. The first spatial derivative of these voltage signals was calculated .
In the silicon probe experiments, we measured the impedance of all contact sites
at 10, 100, and 1000 Hz (Intan recording software, Intan Technologies, Los
Angeles) and excluded those channels whose impedance values were higher than 2
MOhm: 500 sinus cycles were averaged for each condition and then the peak-to-
peak amplitude was measured for each channel and a mean shank voltage was
computed. Finally, we calculated the first spatial derivative of these potential values.
Statistical tests. Unless otherwise noted Student’s paired t-test with Bonferroni
correction was used for pairwise data comparison, Pearson’s linear correlation was
calculated for correlation analyses and mean ± SEM values are displayed with the
full data sets superimposed. Data with non-normal distribution are reported as
median and interquartile range (IQR). Boxplots with whiskers denote the medians,
interquartile ranges, and full ranges. For data sets with non-normal distribution,
non-parametric tests were used instead. Welch’s correction was applied when
variances were not equal. To preserve visibility of the figure panels, significance
levels of <0.05, <0.01, and <0.005 are marked by one, two, or three asterisks,
respectively. For simplicity, P values smaller than 0.001 are reported as <0.001
instead of stating the absolute value. The detailed conditions, numeric results, and
effect sizes of the statistical comparisons are listed in the Supplementary Results.
Analysis of whole-cell patch clamp recordings. To remove the stimulation
artifacts, after retracting the patch-pipettes, the artifacts of the same set of electrical
stimuli applied during the whole-cell recordings were recorded extracellularly. The
recorded artifacts were subtracted from the intracellularly recorded potentials to
recover the true transmembrane potentials25. Power spectra of the stimulated and
control epochs were calculated on a trial-by-trial basis, using fast Fourier trans-
form, before averaging. Spectra were whitened by the 1/f method.
Noise removal and analysis of EEG activity. The stimulus artifact was removed
offline by subtracting a triggered moving average (t = 10 epochs), followed by
triple-sweeps of 100th order zero phase-lag high-pass finite impulse response filter
(f = 2 Hz) in MATLAB.
For analyses performed on the time domain (e.g., alpha amplitude) the artifact-
free signal was filtered in the alpha band with a zero phase-lag fourth-order
Butterworth filter. Instantaneous alpha amplitudes were determined by calculating
the magnitude of the Hilbert-transformed filtered signal, and binned based on the
corresponding ISP amplitude and phase. Binned values were averaged across
epochs. To estimate the amplitude of the remaining electrical noise time locked to
the epochs, signal was first averaged across epochs, and then Hilbert transformed.
This approach preserved time-locked features. For frequency domain analyses,
spectral amplitudes were calculated using fast-Fourier transformation, and

 smoothed using a moving average filter (width = 2 Hz). 120–140 Hz was chosen as
a control frequency band, as this range does not represent measurable physiological
oscillatory signals on the scalp but would still mirror the presence of broadband
electrical artifacts. For time-resolved spectral analysis, spectra were calculated using
a multitaper fast Fourier transform on 1-s long consecutive segments. Spectra were
whitened by multiplying each frequency by the frequency value (1/f method).
Frequency-amplitude and phase-amplitude analysis of EEG. We employed two
complementary analyses to assess the modulation of EEG amplitude by the phase
of the sinusoidal ISP stimulation current. Analyses were performed on 1-min-long
consecutive epochs, and the epoch results were pooled. First, we applied the
complex wavelet transform using Morlet mother wavelets to calculate the ampli-
tude and phase for a wide range of EEG frequencies. Wavelet amplitudes were
calculated from 1 to 30 Hz at 59 levels from the artifact-free EEG and wavelet phase
for 21 levels from 0.5 to 5 Hz at 15 levels from either the original EEG or a
synthetic signal constructed from the stimulation pulses. Phase–amplitude cross-
frequency coupling was quantified using a modulation index (MI58). To quantify
frequency–amplitude modulation, 2-D comodulograms were constructed with the
MI values for every phase–amplitude frequency pair and the maximal MI in the
band of interest was detected59. For phase–amplitude modulation, phase time-
series were binned into phase intervals and the mean wavelet amplitude was cal-
culated for each of them and z-scored. Phase time-series were binned into phase
intervals and the mean wavelet amplitude was calculated for each of them59.
For a complementary phase–amplitude analysis performed on the time domain,
the estimated peak-to-peak amplitude values of the individual alpha waves were
binned based on the actual stimulus phase, and alpha amplitude values during the
stimulus peak and trough bins (45, 90, 135, 225, 270, 315°) were compared to the
alpha amplitude values present at the transitional phase (0° and 180°) bins using a
t-test.
Data availability. The data sets generated and analyzed during the current study
