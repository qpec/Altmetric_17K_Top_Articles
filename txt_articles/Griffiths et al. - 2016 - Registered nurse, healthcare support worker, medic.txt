ABSTRACT
Objectives: To examine associations between
mortality and registered nurse (RN) staffing in English
hospital trusts taking account of medical and
healthcare support worker (HCSW) staffing.
Setting: Secondary care provided in acute hospital
National Health Service (NHS) trusts in England.
Participants: Two data sets are examined:
Administrative data from 137 NHS acute hospital trusts
(staffing measured as beds per staff member). A cross-
sectional survey of 2917 registered nurses in a subsample
of 31 trusts (measured patients per ward nurse).
Outcome measure: Risk-adjusted mortality rates for
adult patients (administrative data).
Results: For medical admissions, higher mortality was
associated with more occupied beds per RN (RR 1.22,
95% CI 1.04 to 1.43, p=0.02) and per doctor (RR 1.10,
95% CI 1.05 to 1.15, p <0.01) employed by the trust
whereas, lower HCSW staffing was associated with lower
mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00, p=0.04). In
multivariable models the relationship was statistically
significant for doctors (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15,
p=0.02) and HCSWs (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98,
p<01) but not RNs (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.38,
p=0.17). Trusts with an average of ≤6 patients per RN in
medical wards had a 20% lower mortality rate compared
to trusts with >10 patients per nurse (RR 0.80, 95% CI
0.76 to 0.85, p<0.01). The relationship remained
significant in the multivariable model (RR 0.89, 95% CI
0.83 to 0.95, p<0.01). Results for surgical wards/
admissions followed a similar pattern but with fewer
significant results.
Conclusions: Ward-based RN staffing is significantly
associated with reduced mortality for medical patients.
There is little evidence for beneficial associations with
HCSW staffing. Higher doctor staffing levels is associated
with reduced mortality. The estimated association between
RN staffing and mortality changes when medical and
HCSW staffing is considered and depending on whether
ward or trust wide staffing levels are considered.
INTRODUCTION
Ensuring the safety of hospital care is a para-
mount
concern
for
healthcare
systems
worldwide. Despite increasing expenditure
and focus on patient safety in many coun-
tries, there remains considerable variation in
hospital
trust
mortality
that
cannot
be
explained by measurable variation in case
mix or individual patient risk.1 2 Registered
nurse (RN) staffing has been identified as an
important modifiable factor that is associated
with mortality in many studies across the
world.3–5 A higher level of registered nurse
staffing is associated with lower mortality and
better quality of care. The strength of associ-
ation varies across studies and settings, but a
6% increase in the odds of death associated
with one additional patient per nurse is
typical.5

Findings
such
as
these
have
informed
policies
mandating
minimum
nurse
patient
ratios
in
some
US
and
Australian
states.7
However,
despite
the
apparently strong evidence base, the implica-
tions of the findings remain contested by
many and there remains significant resist-
ance to mandated ratios from politicians and
healthcare providers in many countries.8

Economic pressures and the ageing profile
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ Most previous work has been concentrated in
North America with few papers based on UK
data.
▪ Like much of the research in this field, it uses a
cross-sectional observational design and reports
association (so cannot demonstrate causation).
▪ This study makes a unique contribution by
including medical and healthcare support worker
staffing in examining the observed relationships
between trust staffing and mortality.
▪ The inclusion of medical staffing data however
creates a limitation, in that the quality of the data
available in England is restricted to posts: bed
ratios.

BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008751 on 9 February 2016. Downloaded from 
 of the nursing workforce internationally all point to a
potential future with fewer registered nurses.10 Current
plans for workforce development in England and other
countries point toward a significant increase in the
numbers
and
proportion
of
unregistered
support
workers
and
assistant
practitioners,
relative
to
the
number
of
registered
nurses
and
registered
nurse
recruitment remains problematic.11 12
However, such a shift seems to be at odds with evi-
dence that points toward a more highly trained nursing
workforce being associated with fewer adverse events.13
Research from the US and Europe showed that having a
higher proportion of degree qualified nurses in the
workforce was associated with lower surgical mortality
rates,5 14 15 while cross-sectional studies in England have
found that hospitals with more unqualified nurses per
bed16 and a higher proportion of support staff to regis-
tered nurses17 had higher mortality rates. Both these
English studies also showed a significant negative associ-
ation between staffing by medical doctors and mortality
rates; higher medical staffing levels were associated with
lower
mortality
rates.16
17
Indeed,
the
associations
between registered nurse staffing and mortality were not
significant when medical staffing was included in multi-
variable analyses. These studies have limitations. Both
used organisation level staffing data, which may not
reflect the deployment of staff on wards. The Keogh
review, undertaken to explore higher than expected
mortality rates in 14 NHS trusts, revealed a discrepancy
between the view of nurse staffing levels gained from
administrative data (full-time equivalent, FTE per bed)
versus observing nurse staffing ‘on the ground’.18
None the less, these studies serve to illustrate that a
failure to consider other staff groups concurrently is a
significant limitation in much of the existing research
on this topic. The boundaries between the work of dif-
ferent staff groups is fluid and there is some potential
for the work of one group to substitute to some degree
for that of another. For example, there is some evidence
that substitution between nurses and doctors may be
cost-effective in a variety of settings19 and in the UK for
example, responsibilities have passed from doctors to
nurses as the working hours of hospital doctors have
reduced in response to EU legislative changes.20 On the
other hand, unqualified support workers can undertake
both clerical work and some aspects of clinical nursing
care.20
This study therefore aims to determine the association
between mortality and trust level registered nurse staff-
ing in English general acute NHS hospital trusts while
simultaneously considering staffing by support workers
and doctors using routinely collected administrative
data. Since routine data on ward level staffing is not
widely available in national data sources, we also use
ward level nurse data from a nationally representative
subsample of trusts, derived from the RN4CAST survey
of nurses21 to estimate nurse staffing actually deployed
on wards.
METHODS
Data sources
We obtained details of the workforce characteristics of
NHS acute hospital trusts providing inpatient general
medical and surgical care from the annual NHS staff
census for 2009/2010 and 2010/2011. We excluded spe-
cialist trusts (eg, cancer, paediatrics), mental health
trusts and trusts with low numbers of general medical/
surgical admissions. We obtained details of teaching
status, bed occupancy and number of beds from the
annual estates and facilities statistics for 2009/2010 and
2010/2011. From this, we calculated ratios of beds per
RN, doctors and healthcare support workers (HCSWs
including healthcare assistants and auxiliary nurses).
HCSWs in England are unregistered care staff (without
nursing qualifications) who undertake many aspects of
fundamental care for patients in NHS hospital wards
(such as helping patients to wash, use the toilet, and
monitoring vital signs). Patient data were obtained from
the national Hospital Episode Statistics for patients
admitted in the 2 years from 1 April 2009 to 31 March
2011. We were able to link trust level staffing, bed occu-
pancy and mortality data for 137 trusts. The census data
does not specifically identify nurses employed delivering
inpatient care on wards. Therefore, in addition to the
data derived from routinely collected data sets, we also
assessed nurse staffing on medical and surgical wards
directly for a nationally representative subsample of 31
trusts, by means of a survey of nurses from a stratified
random sample of general medical/surgical wards (up
to 10) in each hospital in the trust. The survey was
undertaken from January to September 2010 as part of
the RN4CAST study. RNs in the 31 trusts (covering 46
hospitals and 401 wards) were surveyed; 2990 of 7609
(39%) responded. The nurse response rate varied
between the 31 trusts from 19% to 69%.
Nurses reported on patient and staff numbers present
on their last shift. Patients per RN and patients per
HCSW were calculated for each nurse responding to the
survey. Staffing levels (patients per nurse) for the
medical and surgical wards of each hospital trust were
estimated by averaging responses from all nurses in each
specialty. Wards classified as mixed medical/surgical
were treated as medical. Detail of the design and
methods of this survey reported elsewhere.21 22
Risk-adjusted mortality
We calculated the predicted number of deaths in hos-
pital trusts for both medical and surgical admissions,
using a method based on that used to calculate the
summary mortality Indicator in England.23 This uses
indirect standardisation for age, sex, elective status,
socioeconomic deprivation (Index of multiple depriv-
ation), comorbidity (modified Charlson Index) and
number
of
emergency
admissions
in
the
previous
12 months. We collapsed reasons for admission into the
Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) groupings given
by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.24

 For each CCS group we built a logistic regression model
to predict the probability of death. We divided admis-
sions into medical and surgical specialties using the spe-
cialty code of the admitting consultant and calculated
the predicted number of deaths in each group for each
trust by summing the predicted number of deaths across
all CCS groups. Thus we were able to assess the risk of
deaths in a trust relative to the number that would be
expected given the case mix.
Analysis data set
Data consisted of observed and expected deaths aggre-
gated by medical and surgical specialty for 2009–2010
and 2010–2011 separately. These data were linked to
trust level staffing data, hospital trust size and teaching
status for each year.
Analysis
We used the Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE)
modelling procedure in SPSS V.22 to produce crude and
adjusted effects of staffing on mortality. GEE was used in
preference to a multilevel model because it is more
suited to estimating population average effects. There
were only two time-points, which would have limited the
usefulness of a multilevel model. Observed deaths were
regressed on the independent variables and the natural
log of the expected number of deaths was used as an
offset. All adjusted staffing effects controlled for hospital
trust size (bed numbers), admission year and teaching
status.
For the national (137 trusts) analysis we calculated
ratios of staff per occupied bed at the hospital trust level
and used mortality and staffing data for 2009–2010 and
2010–2011. For the analysis of the subsample (n=31) we
used data from 2010–2011 only (to most closely match
when the survey was in the field) and used estimates of
RN per patient and HCSW per patient for medical and
surgical units derived from ward staffing reported in our
survey to model associations with medical and surgical
mortality, respectively. Ward-based RN staffing levels
were modelled in four groups (in medical ≤6 (n=2),
6.01–8.00 (n=13), 8.01–10.00 (n=13) and ≥10 (n=2); in
surgical ≤6 (n=6), 6.01–8.00 (n=16), 8.01–10.00 (n=8)
and
≥10
(n=1)).
Since
no
equivalent
ward-based
measure of medical staffing was available we retained
hospital trust level doctors per bed to control for
medical staffing in this analysis.
An assessment of collinearity was performed prior to
fitting the GEE models. If the condition index was 30 or
greater the independent variables would be further scru-
tinised using the variance inflation factor and variance
proportions.25 26 Consideration was then given to remov-
ing variables causing the collinearity from the model.
The condition index was below 30 for all models without
interactions. However, when interactions (eg, occupied
beds per FTE RN x occupied beds per FTE HCSW)
were added the condition indices exceeded 100 and so
interactions were excluded from the models.
RESULTS
In the 137 hospital trusts there were 9 669 555 medical
admissions and 9 302 292 surgical admissions over 2 years,
with overall death rates of 32.8 and 7.9/1000, respectively.
There was substantial variation between trusts in medical
and nurse staffing with a more than fourfold variation in
registered nurse staffing between the lowest and highest
staffed hospital trust. This was attenuated when consider-
ing all nursing staff (RN + HCSW), although the variation
was still more than threefold. These large variations are
reflected in the 31 trusts where we had measures of nurse
staffing on wards, where variation between highest and
lowest staffed ranged from 2 to 2.5 times across staff
groups and specialties (table 1).
The correlations between staffing variables were typic-
ally weak to moderate although there was a strong cor-
relation between occupied beds per FTE RN and
occupied beds per FTE Doctor (r=0.72; table 2).
Whole trust staffing
In the unadjusted analysis for medical admissions, an
increase in the number of occupied beds per whole time
equivalent RN (RR 1.22, p=0.016) and doctor (RR 1.10,
p<0.001) were associated with an increase in mortality. For
HCSW this association was reversed (RR 0.95, p=0.041). In
the adjusted analysis the association for RNs was attenuated
and no longer statistically significant (RR 1.14, p=0.17), but
remained statistically significant for doctors (RR 1.08,
p=0.016) and for HCSWs (RR 0.93, p=0.003; table 2).
For surgical admissions, neither occupied beds per RN
(RR 1.15, p=0.088) nor HCSW (RR 0.96, p=0.20) were
significantly associated with mortality although the direc-
tion of the associations were similar to that for medical
admissions. An increase in the number of occupied beds
per FTE Doctor was significantly associated with an

 increase in mortality (RR 1.08, p=0.020). In the adjusted
model the association with occupied beds per FTE
Doctor strengthened (RR 1.13, p=0.002), but remained
non-significant for RNs (RR 0.94, p=0.59) and HCSWs
(RR 0.95, p=0.22; table 3).
Ward-based nurse staffing
In our subsample of 31 trusts where we used a survey to
measure nurse staffing on medical and surgical wards,
mortality rates were similar to the national sample with
35.2 deaths/1000 medical admissions (total medical
admissions 1 260 558) and 8.9 deaths/1000 surgical
admissions (total surgical admissions 1 084 429). All
staffing variables were significantly associated with mor-
tality in the unadjusted analysis (p<0.01, table 4).
Mortality was higher in trusts where RNs cared for more
patients. Trusts with six or less patients per RN in medical
wards had a 20% lower risk of death among medical
patients compared to trusts with over 10 patients per nurse
(RR 0.80, p<0.001). The corresponding reduction for sur-
gical wards/patients was 17% (RR 0.83, p=0.049). This dif-
ference was attenuated but remained significant in the
adjusted model for medical wards (RR 0.89, p<0.001) but
not for surgical wards (RR 0.89, p=0.23) (table 4).
Every additional patient per HCSW was associated
with a 1% increase in mortality for medical patients (RR
1.01, p=0.001) and a 2% increase for surgical patients
(RR 1.02, p=0.002). These adjusted associations were
attenuated and non-significant, although on surgical
wards this association neared statistical significance (RR
1.01, p=0.053; table 4).
The unadjusted associations with occupied beds per
FTE doctor were stronger in this subsample than in the
137 trusts. These associations were significant in the
unadjusted (medical RR 1.24, p<0.001; surgical RR 1.22,
p<0.001)
and
adjusted
analyses
(medical
RR
1.12,
p<0.001; surgical RR 1.15, p=0.010; table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we assessed associations between RN staff-
ing and mortality using both national administrative
staffing data and surveys of ward level staffing in a sub-
sample.
We
simultaneously
considered
staffing
by
medical doctors and support workers (HCSW). When all
staff groups were included (in the analysis of 137 hos-
pital trusts) the adjusted associations with mortality were
not statistically significant for nurse staffing but were for
doctor staffing. In our subsample higher nurse staffing
levels were significantly associated with lower mortality
among
both
medical
and
surgical
patients
in
the
adjusted model. Higher HCSW staffing was associated
with higher levels of risk adjusted mortality in the ana-
lysis of 137 trusts. In the subsample, which used nurse
survey-based estimates of HCSW staffing levels, the
adjusted association was not significant.
Although the evidence showing associations between
higher RN staffing and reduced mortality is extensive, few
previous studies have considered staffing by both doctors
and HCSW while exploring the relationship and none has
done so using estimates of ward-based nurse staffing.
Previous studies using hospital trust level data found little
evidence for a relationship between RN staffing and mor-
tality adjusting for medical staffing16 17 although one US
study, which did not include HCSW staffing, found a signifi-
cant relationship for RN staffing after adjusting for medical
staffing.27 A study of ICUs in England found a relationship
between consultant numbers, RN numbers and mortality,
but no evidence of a relationship with support worker
levels.28 Other studies which have considered less highly
qualified nursing staff in hospitals (licensed practical
nurses and unlicensed support workers) have shown
higher numbers of less trained staff or a diluted nursing
skill mix to be associated with higher mortality or lower
cost-effectiveness.16 17 29 In our study the negative relation-
ship was not replicated when considering estimates of
ward-based HCSW staffing. However, a challenge in inter-
preting study findings, is the extent to which the role of the
Health Care Support Worker or ‘nursing aide’ role varies.30
This illustrates that the source of data used to explore
these
associations
is
an
important
consideration.
Inferences about ward staffing made from hospital or
trust level data may be incorrect.
There is currently significant debate about establishing
mandatory minimum nurse staffing levels in England
and elsewhere. However, the evidence base to draw on
in order to identify specific safe staffing ratios is slim,
despite the large volume of research. Recommended or
mandated staffing levels for RNs in general medical and
surgical units range from no more than four patients
per RN (day shift in level 1 hospitals in the State of
Victoria, Australia) to 10 patients per RN at night (level
2/3 hospitals in Victoria). Ratios between 4–1 and 6–1
on day shifts are typical.31 In this study, irrespective of
specialty, the risk of mortality was 11% lower in trusts
where registered nurses reported caring for an average
of 6 or fewer patients compared to trusts where nurses
reported caring for an average of 10 or more.
Although the pattern of results for medical and surgi-
cal mortality were similar, we did not find significant

 adjusted associations between registered nurse staffing
and surgical mortality, using either the trust-wide or
nurse estimated ward staffing. In previous research the
relationship between RN staffing and surgical patient
outcomes has been clearer than for medical patients.32
We used all surgical admissions in our study, where
overall mortality rates are low, whereas previous research
has typically focused on high-risk subgroups of patients,
which may provide a more sensitive indicator.
Although policy in England has raised the possibility
of using HCSW to substitute for RNs, the evidence here
suggests that this may not be consistent with patient
safety. We found that trusts with more HCSWs per bed
had higher rates of mortality among medical patients.
Although this finding was not replicated when we
looked at nurse estimated ward staffing levels, our
adjusted models showed no evidence for benefit from
higher HCSW staffing levels. This is consistent with
other findings from the RN4CAST study which found no
association between the level of HCSW staffing and the
occurrence of missed nursing care reported by RNs.22
While HCSW may deliver essential care, there is no

BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008751 on 9 February 2016. Downloaded from 
 evidence from large observational studies that their pres-
ence in the workforce can substitute for registered
nurses in ensuring patient safety.
In common with most research in this area our study
was cross-sectional and cannot demonstrate causation,
although the association between nurse staffing and mor-
tality has recently been demonstrated in a prospective
study.33 Our study has several limitations; the ward-based
staffing data arises from only 31 trusts and was estimated
from nurse report. This does not, in itself, provide a robust
basis to identify safe staffing thresholds. Although we had
ward level staffing data, it was only possible to model out-
comes at the level of medical/surgical specialties rather
than at the level of the ward, and therefore any variation at
the ward level remains hidden. Further research is
required to provide more robust estimates of associations
in larger samples of hospital trusts. Our results do not
provide support for using HCSW to substitute for regis-
tered nurses but we were unable to consider whether they
may act as complements, enhancing the effectiveness of
RNs, because we were unable to explore the interaction
between different staff groups due to collinearity. However,
our previous work on nursing care left undone suggests
that HCSWs neither substitute for nor complement the
ability of RNs to deliver core professional nursing work.22
CONCLUSIONS
Based on these findings we conclude that while a causal
association between RN staffing and patient outcomes
remains plausible, the current evidence base is not suffi-
cient to identify safe staffing thresholds across different
types of wards. However, given the overall strength of evi-
dence for an association, it does seem feasible to identify
staffing levels where risk to patients is likely to be
increased, as recently suggested in a review of safety in
the NHS.34 When determining the safety of nurse staff-
ing on hospital wards, the level of RN staffing is crucial
and there is no evidence to suggest that higher levels of
HCSW staffing have a role in reducing mortality rates.
Current policies geared toward substituting HCSW for
registered nurses should be reviewed in the light of this
evidence.
Future
research
exploring
associations
between nurse staffing and patient outcomes needs to
include measures of both medically qualified staff and
unregistered practitioners.
