IntroductIon
Commensal microbes, most of which reside in the gut, out-
number mammalian cells ∼10:1 and contain ∼100-fold 
more genes than the human genome (Savage, 1977; Bäck-
hed et al., 2005; Gill et al., 2006; Belkaid and Naik, 2013). 
This vast microbial network is critical for the development 
and maintenance of cellular metabolism, digestion and nu-
trient absorption, and immune system development (Round 
and Mazmanian, 2009; Hooper et al., 2012; Nicholson et al., 
2012). Recent data indicate that gut microbes also regulate 
both normal development and disease pathogenesis in the 
central nervous system (CNS; Collins et al., 2012; Wang and 
Kasper, 2014; Benakis et al., 2016; Winek et al., 2016).
Gut microbiota 
“talk” to the CNS by directly interacting 
with immune cells or nerve fibers and indirectly by secreting 
metabolites that bypass the blood–brain barrier. Most (∼70–
80%) immune cells in the body are located within gut-asso-
ciated lymphoid tissues (GALTs). There, an ongoing dialogue 
between immune cells and gut bacteria produces cytokines 
that affect CNS function (Brandtzaeg, 1989; Castro and Arnt-
zen, 1993). Gut microbes also produce neuroactive metab-
olites (i.e., short chain fatty acids [SCFAs] and choline) and 
neurotransmitters (γ-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, dopamine, 
and acetylcholine; Clarke et al., 2014; Tillisch, 2014) that act 
on both enteric neurons in the gut and also within the CNS 
(Wikoff et al., 2009; Clarke et al., 2014; Forsythe et al., 2014).
Dysbiosis develops when the composition of the gut 
microbiota is altered such that beneficial nonpathogenic gut 
bacteria (i.e., probionts) are depleted or become overwhelmed 
by pathogenic inflammatory bacteria (i.e., pathobionts). Au-
toimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, and 
rheumatoid arthritis), allergies, and metabolic disorders have 
been linked to gut dysbiosis (Berer et al., 2011; Kriegel et al., 
2011; Lee et al., 2011; 
Tilg and Kaser, 2011; Murri et al., 2013; 
Cao et al., 2014; Soyucen et al., 2014). Similarly, dysbiosis has 
been implicated in the onset or progression of neurological 
diseases including autism, pain, depression, anxiety, and stroke 
(Ait-Belgnaoui et al., 2006; Rousseaux et al., 2007; Cryan 
and Dinan, 2012; Foster and McVey Neufeld, 2013; Hsiao et 
al., 2013; de Theije et al., 2014a,b; Benakis et al., 2016; Winek 
et al., 2016). Common causes of gut dysbiosis include anti-
biotic use, stress, and gastrointestinal dysfunction (Hawrelak 
and Myers, 2004; Round and Mazmanian, 2009; Bailey et al., 
2010, 2011). Many of these dysbiosis triggers also cause bac-
terial translocation (BT) or “leaky gut,” a process whereby gut 
bacteria migrate from the intestinal lumen into extraintestinal 
sites (Liu et al., 2004; MacFie, 2004; Magnotti and Deitch, 
2005; Gatt et al., 2007). A healthy gut microbiota is critical for 
preventing BT (Diehl et al., 2013).
Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) causes severe neu-
rological and psychological complications and requires 
secondary care needs that likely predispose SCI individ-
uals to gut dysbiosis. For example, acute and often chronic 
psychological stress is expected because of the sudden and 
the trillions of microbes that exist in the gastrointestinal tract have emerged as pivotal regulators of mammalian development 
and physiology. disruption of this gut microbiome, a process known as dysbiosis, causes or exacerbates various diseases, but 
whether gut dysbiosis affects recovery of neurological function or lesion pathology after traumatic spinal cord injury (ScI) is 
unknown. data in this study show that ScI increases intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation from the gut. these 
changes are associated with immune cell activation in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALts) and significant changes in the 
composition of both major and minor gut bacterial taxa. Postinjury changes in gut microbiota persist for at least one month 
and predict the magnitude of locomotor impairment. Experimental induction of gut dysbiosis in naive mice before ScI (e.g., 
via oral delivery of broad-spectrum antibiotics) exacerbates neurological impairment and spinal cord pathology after ScI. 
conversely, feeding ScI mice commercial probiotics (VSL#3) enriched with lactic acid–producing bacteria triggers a protective 
immune response in GALts and confers neuroprotection with improved locomotor recovery. our data reveal a previously un-
known role for the gut microbiota in influencing recovery of neurological function and neuropathology after ScI.

dramatic life changes experienced by someone with an SCI 
(Boekamp et al., 1996; Elliott and Frank, 1996). Neurogenic 
bladder and bowel develop after SCI as a result of damage 
to spinal autonomic circuitry (Chung and Emmanuel, 2006; 
Enck et al., 2006; Karlsson, 2006; Riegger et al., 2007, 2009). 
SCI-induced dysautonomia also impairs immune function, 
increasing the need for repeat dosing with antibiotics to fight 
infections (Evans et al., 2011, 2013; Failli et al., 2012). Here, 
novel data show that SCI disrupts the gut microbiota and 
that SCI-induced gut dysbiosis is associated with profound 
changes in GALT immune cell activation. Dysbiosis also 
exacerbates intraspinal inflammation and impairs recovery 
of neurological function. Importantly, feeding mice a med-
ical-grade probiotic (VSL#3) after SCI confers neuroprotec-
tion and improves functional recovery.
rESuLtS
ScI induces Bt and persistent gut dysbiosis
Chronic immune suppression, intestinal obstruction, and im-
paired intestinal motility, all complications of experimental 
and clinical SCI, can independently cause BT (MacFie, 2004; 
Magnotti and Deitch, 2005; Gatt et al., 2007). T
o determine 
whether SCI causes BT, we first sought evidence that SCI 
causes indigenous bacteria to migrate from the gastrointesti-
nal tract into sterile extraintestinal sites.
Using sterile techniques, mesenteric LNs (MLNs), livers, 
spleens, kidneys, and blood were collected from naive mice 
and mice that had received a midthoracic (T9) spinal contu-
sion injury 1, 3, or 7 d earlier. Collected tissues were homog-
enized and then plated onto BBL CHR 
OMagar plates. T
o 
control for environmental contamination, mice were housed 
in microisolator cages in the same laboratory environment. 
Importantly, bacteria were never found in cultures from tissues 
isolated from uninjured mice (Fig. 1 A). Conversely, bacteria 
were detected in all tissues from SCI mice by 7 d postinjury 
(dpi; Fig. 1 A). 
These data indicate that SCI causes commensal 
bacteria to translocate from the gut into peripheral tissues.
BT can occur as a result of an increase in paracellu-
lar transport through compromised epithelial tight junctions 
(Cruz et al., 1994; Han et al., 2004; Clark et al., 2005). T
o 
test whether intestinal barrier permeability increases after 
SCI, mice were gavaged with FITC-labeled dextran (4 kD) 
at a time when bacteria were detected in extraintestinal sites 
after SCI (7 dpi), and then FITC levels were measured in 
blood. On average, gut permeability increased 20% after 
SCI (vs. sham-injured mice; Fig. 1 B). In these mice, various 
genes encoding epithelial tight junction proteins that regulate 
paracellular permeability were dramatically affected by SCI 
(Fig. 1 C). Several transcription factors critical for the prolif-
eration (Tcf7l2) and differentiation (Cdx1 and Cdx2) of in-
testinal epithelia increased significantly after SCI (James et al., 
1994; Korinek et al., 1998; Subramanian et al., 1998; Beck et 
al., 1999; Silberg et al., 2000; van de 
Wetering et al., 2002). Ex-
pression of eight other genes that encode different tight junc-
tion proteins also increased in the gut of SCI mice (Fig. 1 C).
A healthy gut microbiota prevents BT (Diehl et al., 
2013). Because BT and intestinal permeability increase after 
SCI (Fig. 1, A and B), we predicted that a microbial imbalance 
would also develop in the intestines of SCI mice. T
o test this 
hypothesis, bacterial cultures were grown from feces collected 
from SCI mice. Data in Fig. 1 D show that after SCI, the num-
ber and types of bacterial colonies that can be cultured from 
feces change; differences in gut microbe composition appear 
within the first week after SCI and persist for at least 21 dpi.
T
o unequivocally prove that SCI causes dysbiosis, 
fecal samples were collected and prepared for bacterial 16S 
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. T
o prevent co-
prophagia and cross-colonization of gut microbiota between 
individual mice, all mice were individually housed. T
o re-
duce the potential effects of stress on the microbiota, fecal 
samples were not collected until mice acclimated in home 
cages for at least 1 wk. Dietary effects on the microbiota 
were controlled for by ensuring that daily food intake was 
equilibrated across all mice. Finally, no antibiotics or dietary 
supplements were given.
16S rRNA sequencing revealed SCI-dependent changes 
in the gut microbiome (Fig. 2 A). Hierarchical clustering of 
naive, sham-injured, and SCI samples showed a profound 
time-dependent effect of SCI on gut microbiome compo-
sition (Fig. 2 A). Specifically, Bacteroidales and Clostridiales, 
the two most prevalent bacterial taxa in mouse gut (Eckburg 
et al., 2005; Krych et al., 2013), were inversely regulated by 
SCI: Bacteroidales decreased while Clostridiales increased 
(Fig. 2, B and C). Significant changes in these taxa were ac-
companied by lesser but consistent changes in minor taxa, 
including Anaeroplasmatales, Turicibacterales, and Lactobacil-
lales (Fig. 2 A). Open-field locomotor (Basso mouse scale 
[BMS]) scores were negatively correlated with the relative 
abundance of Clostridiales and Anaeroplasmatales, suggesting 
that the proportion of these bacteria can predict the mag-
nitude of functional recovery and might be useful as a bio-
marker of injury severity (Fig. 2, D and E).
ScI triggers an immune response in GALt
SCI-induced gut dysbiosis could activate mucosal immune 
cells in GALT, which could subsequently affect systemic and 
intraspinal inflammation (Diehl et al., 2013). T
wo prominent 
areas of immune activation in GALT include Peyer’s patches 
(PPs) and MLNs. Immune surveillance of the intestinal lumen 
is provided by the PPs. Antigens or activated immune cells 
drain from the PPs into the MLNs, which act as a firewall be-
tween the gut and the rest of the body (Koboziev et al., 2010). 
Flow cytometry analyses of cells isolated from MLNs and PPs 
show that SCI-induced gut dysbiosis elicits inflammation in 
GALT (Table 1 and Fig. 3). By 3 dpi, B lymphocytes, CD8+ 
T 
lymphocytes, DCs, and macrophages increased in the MLNs 
relative to those in control mice (Fig. 3, 
A–E; and 
Table 1). 
TNF
, 
IL-1β, 
TGF-β, and IL-10 mRNA expression also increased in 
MLNs by 7 dpi (Fig. 3 F). Conversely, CD4+ T lymphocytes 
decreased by 3 dpi in MLNs and remained below control

levels throughout the duration of the study (Fig. 3 C). Similar 
cellular changes were noted in PPs, although the magnitude 
of change was smaller and the duration of effect was shorter 
when compared with postinjury changes in MLNs (Table 1). 
Cytokine changes in PPs were not measured.
Gut dysbiosis impairs locomotor recovery and exacerbates 
lesion pathology after ScI
Data in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 show that SCI causes BT, intestinal 
dysbiosis, and activation of mucosal immune cells. T
o deter-
mine the potential consequences of this break in gut–immune 
axis homeostasis, a gain-of-function study was performed in 
which mice with established gut dysbiosis received an SCI 
(Fig. 4 A). Dysbiosis was induced before SCI by mixing a 
cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics into mouse drinking 
water (Chen et al., 2008). T
o confirm depletion of gut bac-
teria and the onset of dysbiosis, fecal samples from individual 
mice were cultured before starting the antibiotic regimen and 
again 7 d after (but before SCI; Fig. 4, A and B). Bacteria 
were notably absent in feces from mice receiving antibiot-
ics (Fig. 4 B). However, despite maintenance on antibiotics, 
7–14 d after SCI in these same mice, there was an overgrowth 
in the gut of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Fig. 4 B). This gut 
dysbiosis persisted for at least 21 dpi (Fig. 4 B). In a separate 
experiment, fecal samples from SCI mice with and without 
antibiotic-induced dysbiosis were analyzed using 16S rRNA 
sequencing (Table S3). In these samples, total sequence counts 
from mice given antibiotics were too low to generate reliable 
Figure 1. ScI causes Bt and gut dysbiosis. (A) Tissue samples collected from mice at various times after SCI were processed using sterile techniques 
and then were plated onto BBL CHR 
OMagar plates to assess bacterial growth. No bacteria were found in tissues from naive mice or mice at 1 dpi. By 7 dpi, 
bacteria could be cultured from all tissues (χ2 contingency; n = 4 per time point). (B) Intestinal permeability was tested by oral gavage of FITC-dextran (4 kD) 
 
with subsequent analysis of FITC fluorescence in the blood. At 7 dpi, there was a significant increase in leakage of FITC-dextran from the gut in SCI mice 
 
(n = 7 per group). Horizontal bars represent the mean of the sample. (C) mRNA expression of genes encoding transcription factors or epithelial tight junction

data, indicating that the antibiotic regimen induces bacterial 
depletion and dysbiosis (Table S3).
When compared with standard recovery profiles in 
SCI mice, spontaneous locomotor recovery was significantly 
impaired in mice with antibiotic-induced dysbiosis (Fig. 4, 
C–E). SCI mice normally recover frequent or consistent plan-
tar stepping and can coordinate use of fore and hind limbs 
(BMS score = 6). Conversely, SCI mice with antibiotic-in-
duced dysbiosis achieved frequent or consistent plantar step-
ping but without coordination (BMS score = 5), and at the 
peak of recovery (28 and 35 dpi) locomotion was impaired 
by consistent paw rotation during placement and significant 
trunk instability (Fig. 4, C–E).
Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis also exacerbated lesion 
pathology and intraspinal inflammation (Fig. 4, F–L). When 
compared with standard spinal contusion lesions, total lesion 
volumes were ∼30% larger, with ∼25% less spared white mat-
ter at the injury epicenter in SCI mice with antibiotic-in-
duced dysbiosis (Fig. 4, F–H). Also, in these same mice at 14 
dpi, the peak of intraspinal inflammation after SCI (Kigerl et 
Figure 2. 16S rrnA gene sequencing reveals significant changes in the gut microbiome after ScI. (A) Unbiased hierarchical clustering techniques 
reveal significant changes in the relative abundance of major and minor bacteria taxa after SCI. The majority of the SCI samples cluster together on the left 
half of the heatmap, whereas the majority of the naive and laminectomy control samples cluster on the right half. (B and C) Bacteria from the two major or-
ders of gut bacteria, Bacteriodales and Clostridiales, are reciprocally regulated after SCI. Relative abundance of Bacteroidales decreases as a function of time 
after SCI (B), whereas Clostridiales increases (C). Box and whisker plots show the minimum to maximum values. The horizontal line in each box represents 
the median of that group. n = 6–10 per time point. Trend lines show significant rates of change as functions of time after injury using the mixed effects 
model with repeated measures. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001. (D and E) Importantly, the relative abundance of Clostridiales and Anaeroplasmatales 
inversely correlate with locomotor recovery, as assessed by BMS (Pearson correlation; n = 6–10 per time point; each dot represents an individual mouse).

al., 2006), the magnitude of the microglia/macrophage reac-
tion (CD11b+ cells) and the total numbers of infiltrating T 
(CD3+) and B (CD45R+) lymphocytes increased (Fig. 4, I–L).
The antibiotic cocktail used to induce dysbiosis in-
cludes aminoglycosides (gentamycin and streptomycin) and 
quinolones (ciprofloxacin). Both classes of antibiotics are used 
to treat pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and wound in-
fections; however, they can also cause sickness-like behaviors 
and act directly on the nervous system to affect neurologi-
cal or neuromuscular function (Grill and Maganti, 2011). As 
such, it is possible that the exacerbated pathology and im-
paired locomotor recovery that occurs in gain-of-function 
dysbiotic SCI mice were caused by direct neuroactive effects 
of the antibiotics. Because we delivered antibiotics for 18 d, 
beginning 1 wk before SCI, it is possible that the spinal cord 
or brain was damaged before delivering a spinal contusion 
injury. 
To explore this possibility, weight loss/gain and sponta-
neous motor function and exploratory behaviors were quan-
tified. At 0 dpi, mice in the SCI + dysbiosis group had already 
been dosed with antibiotics for 7 d (starting 7 d preinjury). 
Preinjury weights in these mice and spontaneous movement 
(not depicted) were indistinguishable from control SCI mice 
(i.e., there were no signs of cachexia or sickness-like behav-
iors). Similarly, patterns of postinjury weight loss/gain tracked 
together with SCI control mice through 1 mo after injury 
(Fig. 5 B). Spontaneous movement and overall distance trav-
eled at 7 and 14 dpi, times preceding and corresponding with 
the onset of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, respectively, also 
were indistinguishable between groups (Fig. 5, A and B).
To determine whether antibiotics affect blood–spinal 
cord barrier permeability, a possible consequence of early 
antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis or neurotoxicity, Evans blue 
dye was injected into intact mice dosed with saline or antibi-
otics for 7 d. As expected, Evans blue dye can be detected in 
CNS parenchyma adjacent to regions containing fenestrated 
capillaries (e.g., circumventricular organs; Fig. 5 D). However, 
Evans blue dye was never detected in the spinal cord, indi-
cating that antibiotics do not compromise the blood–spinal 
cord barrier (Fig. 5 E).
Because antibiotics are used to treat bacteremia in SCI 
patients (Waites et al., 2001; Evans et al., 2009; Dinh et al., 
2016), it was important to determine whether antibiotics and 
the subsequent onset of dysbiosis can cause delayed neuro-
logical impairment. T
o test this, mice received an SCI, and, 
2 wk later after locomotor function plateaued, antibiotics 
were added to the drinking water of half the mice. Surpris-
ingly, delayed induction of gut dysbiosis with antibiotics did 
not impair locomotor function (Fig. 5 C).
T
ogether, these data indicate that antibiotics induce gut 
dysbiosis, which exacerbates intraspinal pathology and impairs 
neurological function. However, the effects of gut dysbiosis 
on spinal cord structure and function may be time dependent 
(i.e., limited to the acute postinjury phase). Alternatively, any 
delayed effects of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis may be over-
whelmed by preexisting gut dysbiosis caused by SCI.
Postinjury probiotic treatment improves locomotor 
recovery after ScI and induces an antiinflammatory 
immune phenotype in GALt
The natural microbiota contains small amounts of probiotic 
lactic acid bacteria, and oral delivery of probiotics can re-
verse the pathological effects of gut dysbiosis. In SCI patients, 
probiotics have been used to treat urinary tract infections 
and gastrointestinal distress (Anukam et al., 2009; Wong et 
al., 2014). However, whether probiotics can confer neuro-
protection or ameliorate neurological dysfunction caused by 
SCI has not been tested.
In an effort to develop a clinically feasible therapeutic 
protocol, SCI mice received VSL#3 probiotics (5 × 109 bac-
teria/dose via oral gavage) starting immediately after injury 
and then again daily until 35 dpi. In 
VSL#3-treated SCI mice, 
locomotor recovery was significantly improved relative to ve-
hicle-treated SCI mice (Fig. 6, A and B). VSL#3 increased 
the frequency of plantar stepping and fore limb–hind limb 
coordination with concomitant improvements in paw posi-
tion and trunk stability (Fig. 6, A and B). 
VSL#3 also reduced 
lesion volume and axon/myelin pathology at the injury 
epicenter (Fig. 6, C and D). Smaller lesion volumes in the

VSL#3-treated mice correlated with improved behavioral re-
covery (*, P = 0.03; not depicted).
Probiotics influence mucosal homeostasis through var-
ious mechanisms, including regulation of intestinal microbial 
homeostasis, stabilizing gut epithelial barrier function, and 
modulation of local and systemic immune responses (Verna 
and Lucak, 2010; van Baarlen et al., 2013). Probiotics also can 
normalize or reverse pathological immune responses in GALT, 
primarily via activation of regulatory T lymphocytes (T reg

icant changes in gut microbe composition. Notably, Bifido-
bacteriales and Lactobacillales, which are enriched in 
VSL#3, 
increased only in 
VSL#3-treated mice (Fig. 6, J and K).
T
ogether, these data indicate that probiotics may have 
therapeutic value after SCI. VSL#3, a medical-grade probi-
otic, can increase the relative abundance of lactic acid–pro-
ducing bacteria in the gut, overcoming the pathogenic effects 
of SCI-induced gut dysbiosis on both intraspinal pathology 
and recovery of neurological function. 
dIScuSSIon
The gut microflora create a complex ecosystem that is essen-
tial for maintenance of human health. Any factors that cause 
sustained changes in the composition of gut bacteria create a 
state of gut dysbiosis that can cause or exacerbate disease. Data 
in this study indicate that traumatic SCI causes profound gut 
dysbiosis that persists for at least 4 wk after injury, although 
even longer durations are expected in humans and animals 
because neurogenic bladder/bowel and gastrointestinal dys-
function are chronic complications of mammalian SCI. In 
mice with SCI-induced gut dysbiosis, gut permeability and 
BT are increased. These changes are associated with sustained 
activation of mucosal immune cells in GALT (e.g., MLNs 
and PPs). A causal role for gut dysbiosis in the secondary 
pathophysiology of SCI was proved using an experimental 
tool analogous to a genetic gain-of-function study. Specifi-
cally, an antibiotic cocktail was used to induce gut dysbiosis 
before SCI. In mice given antibiotics, intraspinal pathology 
and inflammation were exacerbated, and recovery of loco-
motor function was significantly impaired relative to normal 
SCI mice. Importantly, the effects of SCI dysbiosis were time 
dependent and could be blocked by treating mice with probi-
otics after SCI. Postinjury probiotics increased the presence of 
neuroprotective lactic acid–producing bacteria in the gut of 
SCI mice and activated immune 
T reg lymphocytes in GALT. 
Both changes were associated with neuroprotection and im-
proved neurological recovery. T
ogether, these data highlight a 
previously unappreciated role for the gut–CNS–immune axis 
in regulating recovery after SCI.
16S rRNA sequencing identified in the SCI mouse 
gut reciprocal changes in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, two 
major bacterial taxa in both mouse and human microbiota 
(Eckburg et al., 2005; Krych et al., 2013). The relative abun-
dance of Bacteroidetes (order Bacteroidales) decreased sig-
nificantly as a function of time after injury and corresponded 
with a time-dependent increase in Firmicutes (order Clos-
tridiales). A similar reciprocal change in the Bacteroidetes/
Firmicutes ratio occurs in obese humans and rodents, and 
obesity can be transmitted by microbiota transplantation (Ley 
et al., 2006; Turnbaugh et al., 2006, 2008). Thus, gut microbi-
ota represent novel genetic determinants that, together with 
changes in diet and lifestyle, contribute to the pathophysi-
ology of obesity (Turnbaugh and Gordon, 2009; Ley, 2010; 
Tilg and Kaser, 2011; Baothman et al., 2016). Precisely how 
obesity dysbiosis causes or exacerbates adiposity is not known, 
but a high Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was found to in-
crease energy harvest from the diet. Indeed, obese microbiota 
are more efficient than nonobese microbiota at metaboliz-
ing and absorbing dietary substrates (Bäckhed et al., 2004, 
2007; 
Turnbaugh et al., 2006). It is intriguing to speculate that 
SCI-induced changes in gut ecology contribute to the high 
incidence of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic dis-
ease in SCI humans (Manns et al., 2005; Nelson et al., 2007; 
Maruyama et al., 2008).
By reducing the availability of microbe-derived neu-
roactive metabolites, including serotonin precursors (Clarke 
et al., 2013; O’Mahony et al., 2015; Yano et al., 2015) and 
SCFAs (Cryan and Dinan, 2012; Erny et al., 2015), dysbio-
sis also could contribute to the onset and progression of in-
traspinal and systemic pathology after SCI. There is a large 
literature documenting the health benefits of SCFAs, includ-
ing butyrate, and recent data show that post-SCI dysbiosis 
causes a preferential loss of butyrate-producing gut bacteria 
in humans (Ferrante et al., 2003; Sun et al., 2015; Butchbach 
et al., 2016; Gungor et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016). This may 
explain why daily dosing with VSL#3, a medical-grade pro-
biotic consisting of eight distinct lactic acid bacteria, primar-
ily Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, is therapeutic in SCI 
mice. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium produce butyrate, 
other SCFAs, and neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, 
and γ-aminobutyric acid; Furusawa et al., 2013; El Aidy et 
al., 2015; O’Mahony et al., 2015). These neurometabolites, 
produced locally in the gut, can spill into the circulation, 
bypass the blood–brain barrier, and influence CNS struc-
ture and function (Wikoff et al., 2009; Furusawa et al., 2013; 
Yano et al., 2015; Rothhammer et al., 2016). Probiotics have 
been shown to reduce neurological dysfunction or pathology 
caused by experimental autoimmune disease (e.g., experi-
mental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), depression/anxiety, 
traumatic brain injury, and autism spectrum disorders (Lav-
asani et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2011; Dinan et al., 2013; Hsiao et 
al., 2013; Kwon et al., 2013).
The therapeutic effects of 
VSL#3 may also be attributed 
to the induction of T reg lymphocytes. T reg lymphocytes, a 
population of CD4+CD25+ T cells that express the transcrip-
tion factor FoxP3, play a crucial role in maintaining immune 
homeostasis. Loss of T reg lymphocyte function is implicated 
in the onset or progression of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, graft versus host disease, and inflammatory bowel 
disease. Probiotics, especially those containing Lactobacillus 
and Bifidobacterium, significantly enhance T reg lymphocyte 
activity and can reduce inflammatory pathology within and 
outside the CNS (Lavasani et al., 2010; Bilate and Lafaille, 
2012; Kwon et al., 2013). We found that in the MLNs of SCI 
mice treated with VSL#3, numbers of CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ 
T reg lymphocytes increased significantly, signifying that the 
probiotics had the intended effect on activating these neuro-
protective mucosal immune cells. Whether enhanced T reg 
lymphocyte activity was causal in reducing pathology or im-
proving recovery in VSL#3-treated mice is not known. In-
 2613
JEM Vol. 213, No. 12
deed, any or all of the mechanisms described previously are 
plausible and could explain how postinjury dysbiosis contrib-
utes to pathology after SCI and, similarly, how 
VSL#3 blocks 
or reverses these effects.
Data in this study also identify enhanced gut epithe-
lial permeability with BT as mechanisms that explain how 
systemic inflammation develops after SCI (Gris et al., 2008; 
Bao et al., 2011; Fleming et al., 2012). In healthy mice, im-
mune responses to gut bacteria are compartmentalized within 
the mucosal immune system where MLNs act as lymphatic 
firewalls that block gut bacteria and commensal-loaded DCs 
from entering the circulation (Macpherson and Smith, 2006; 
Hill and Artis, 2010). When gut dysbiosis develops, the MLN 
firewall can fail, allowing gut bacteria to pass into the circula-
tion and then distribute throughout the body (Hill and Artis, 
2010; Diehl et al., 2013). After SCI, the early appearance of 
bacteria in the lung can be explained by the presence of a 
gut–lung axis (Fig. 1). Lymph draining from the MLNs enters 
the subclavian vein via the thoracic duct, which then empties 
directly into the heart and lungs (Deitch, 2010). Thus, the 
lung would be one of the first organs to come in contact 
with intestinal bacteria or inflammatory factors derived from 
a dysbiotic gut. This would explain why lung inflammation 
develops as early as 2 h after SCI (Gris et al., 2008) and why 
spontaneous lung infections also develop in experimental 
stroke models (Meisel et al., 2004).
Compromised liver function may exacerbate the mag-
nitude and effects of BT after SCI. Signs of liver disease (e.g., 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]) develop soon after 
SCI, and hepatic inflammation has been implicated as a key 
mediator of intraspinal inflammation (Campbell et al., 2008; 
Fleming et al., 2012; Anthony and Couch, 2014; Sauerbeck et 
al., 2015). Like the MLNs, the liver acts as a firewall, filtering 
gut microbes that drain from the intestine into the hepatic 
portal vein (Jenne and Kubes, 2013; Balmer et al., 2014). In 
SCI animals and humans, liver damage or dysfunction can 
cause the hepatic filtration capacity to become overwhelmed, 
allowing gut microbes to bypass the liver and elicit systemic 
inflammation. NASH is a risk factor for metabolic disease 
and is associated with altered gut microbiota (Dumas et al., 
2006; Abu-Shanab and Quigley, 2010). Thus, the gut micro-
biota may represent a novel therapeutic target for modulating 
systemic inflammation and metabolic diseases after SCI. In 
turn, ameliorating these postinjury sequelae could positively 
affect intraspinal pathology and functional recovery.
In parallel with the increase in gut permeability and 
BT, the expression of genes encoding transcription factors 
or epithelial tight junction proteins that regulate paracellu-
lar permeability increased in SCI mice. This could signify 
the onset of repair responses in damaged or dysfunctional 
gut epithelia after SCI. As an example, Tcf7l2 is essential for 
stem cell proliferation and intestinal self-renewal in mice 
(van Es et al., 2012), and Cdx2 is critical for maintaining 
the differentiation status of intestinal epithelia (Beck et al., 
1999; Hryniuk et al., 2012). Changes in gut permeability, 
epithelial repair, and GALT immune cell activation coincide 
and may delineate a therapeutic window for manipulating 
the adverse effects of gut dysbiosis after SCI. Indeed, initiat-
ing antibiotic-induced dysbiosis 2 wk after injury (i.e., after 
the onset of maximal gut permeability and after mice reach 
a plateau in functional recovery) did not further impair lo-
comotor function. Also, the lasting neuroprotective effects 
of VSL#3 do not correspond with chronic increases in gut 
lactic acid–producing bacteria (Fig. 6). Instead, Lactobacillus 
and Bifidobacterium increase in the gut early after SCI, but 
both taxa diminish even though SCI mice continue to gain 
neurological function. These data suggest that the therapeu-
tic effects of probiotics are established early after SCI; how-
ever, many factors could affect the therapeutic window for 
modulating gut dysbiosis. For example, the magnitude and 
duration of SCI dysbiosis will vary as a function of an indi-
vidual’s baseline gut microflora, changes in diet and lifestyle, 
and injury level. Future studies should consider whether 
dysbiosis contributes to, exacerbates, or causes neurological 
deterioration, systemic inflammation (e.g., lungs, kidneys, 
and liver), immune suppression, deficits in hematopoiesis, 
metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, or nutritional 
deficiencies that are common after SCI. No longer should 
spinal-centric repair approaches dominate SCI research or 
standards of clinical care for affected individuals.
MAtErIALS And MEthodS
Animals and ScI
All surgical and postoperative care procedures were performed 
in accordance with The Ohio State University Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee. All mice were anesthetized 
with an i.p. cocktail of 80 mg/kg ketamine/10 mg/kg xyla-
zine, after which a partial laminectomy was performed at T9. 
All mice received a moderate 75-kilodyne spinal contusion 
injury using the Infinite Horizons injury device. Postoper-
atively, animals were hydrated with 2 ml Ringer’s solution 
(s.c.) for 5 d. Bladders were voided manually at least twice 
daily for the duration of the study. For all SCI studies, mice 
were randomly assigned to cages upon arrival at the housing 
facility. Because gut bacteria can cross-colonize mice living 
in the same cage, animals within a cage received the same 
treatment (i.e., vehicle, antibiotic, or probiotic; Figs. 4, 5, 6). 
Cages were randomly assigned to groups using an online ran-
dom number calculator (QuickCalcs; GraphPad Software). 
Experimenters were blinded to treatment group throughout 
the duration of the study.
Bacterial culture
At 0 (naive), 1, 3, and 7 dpi, mice were euthanized, and blood, 
lung, liver, spleen, and MLNs were aseptically collected (n = 
4 per time point × 2 independent replications). Tissue sam-
ples were homogenized in sterile PBS, and 100 µl was plated 
onto orientation plates (BBL CHR 
OMagar; BD), incubated 
at 37°C for 48 h, and assessed for bacterial growth. From a 
separate set of animals, fecal samples were aseptically collected 
 Gut microbiota and spinal cord injury | Kigerl et al.
2614
from mice at various times after injury (n = 6 per time point) 
and homogenized in 500 µl of sterile PBS. Mice were housed 
according to condition (i.e., vehicle vs. antibiotic treatment) 
to prevent cross-colonization of gut bacteria between groups. 
Samples were diluted to 104, and 100 µl of solution was 
plated onto BBL CHR 
OMagar orientation plates and in-
cubated at 37°C for 48 h.
Bacterial 16S rrnA gene sequencing
All mice used for microbiota sequencing studies (Fig. 2; 
Fig. 6, J and K; and Tables S1, S2, and S3) were individ-
ually housed to prevent cross-colonization of mice in the 
same cage. Female C57BL/6 mice were used for sample 
collection at the following time intervals: preinjury (naive 
mice), 1–3 dpi, 5–7 dpi, 12–14 dpi, 19–21 dpi, and 26–28 
dpi. Fecal samples were collected daily over each time in-
terval and then pooled across the time interval for each 
mouse (e.g., days 1, 2, and 3 after injury were pooled into 
a single 1–3-dpi sample for each mouse). After cleaning the 
walls and floor of a plexiglass open field with a chemical 
disinfectant (Roccal), mice were placed in the open field 
for 30 min. Fecal pellets were collected into sterile tubes at 
the end of the 30-min period and were immediately fro-
zen and stored at −80°C.
dnA extraction and 16S rrnA gene sequencing
DNA was extracted from individual mouse fecal samples by 
the repeated bead beating plus column purification method 
(Yu and Morrison, 2004). DNA quality was checked by aga-
rose gel and quantified by the Quant-iT dsDNA Assay kit 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA were subjected to Miseq 
sequencing (Illumina) following the 2 × 300 pair ended pro-
tocol. The V4–V5 hypervariable regions (primer sets 515F 
and 806R) of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified and se-
quenced using the manufacturer’s method/manual.
Sequencing data processing and analysis
Illumina sequencing data from each experiment were 
processed and analyzed using QII 
ME (v 1.9.0, scikit-bio; 
Caporaso et al., 2010). In brief, paired reads were trimmed 
to remove low-quality bases (Q < 25) and then merged to 
single contigs using fastq-join (Aronesty, 2011). 
The barcodes 
and primers were trimmed from the joined contigs and, after 
trimming, sequences <248 bp were filtered out. The reads 
were assigned to species-equivalent operational taxonomic 
units (OTUs) at 97% similarity by QII 
ME (pick_open 
reference_otus.py) using the uclust algorithm (Edgar, 2010) 
against the Silva_119 released reference sequences (http

/download 
/archive 
/qiime 
/). Chimera se-
quences were identified using ChimeraSlayer (Haas et al., 
2011) against the default Greengenes database (gg_13_08) 
of QII 
ME. If an OTU represented <0.005% of the total 
bacterial sequences (Bokulich et al., 2013) or didn’t have an 
abundance of at least 1% in at least one sample (Jervis-Bardy 
et al., 2015), it was filtered out.
Statistics
For the heatmap, the relative abundance of identified OTUs 
was first standardized by means and standard deviations across 
samples to obtain Z scores (Wilkinson and Friendly, 2009). 
The unbiased hierarchical clustering method was used to 
cluster genus and samples according to the Euclidean distance. 
The mixed effect model, incorporating repeated measures, 
was performed to test the difference in relative abundance 
between the time after injury and the rate of change as a 
function of time after injury (Verbeke and Molenberghs, 2000). 
The association between behavior scores (BMS) and relative 
OTU abundance was evaluated using the Pearson correlation 
method. 
The Microarray Software Suite MeV4.9 (http 
://mev 
.tm4 
.org) was used to generate the heatmap, and SAS 9.4 
statistical software (SAS, Inc.) was used for data analysis.
data availability
All sequence data are accessible in the SRA database (ac-
cession nos. SRP078936 [Fig. 2 and Table S1], SRP078937 
[Fig. 6, J and K; and Table S2], and SRP078940 [Table S3]).
FItc-dextran assay
At 7 dpi, after a 75-kilodyne T9 Infinite Horizons contusion 
SCI (or T9 laminectomy), female C57BL/6 mice (n = 8 per 
group) were given 0.6 g/kg FITC-dextran (4 kD; Sigma-Al-
drich) dissolved in sterile PBS via gastric gavage (food and 
water were removed from the cage the previous night). 4 h after 
FITC-dextran gavage, mice were anesthetized with ketamine/
xylazine, and blood was collected via cardiac puncture. Blood 
was collected into Microtainer SST tubes (BD), and serum was 
isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Blood was 
allowed to clot for 30 min, and then samples were centrifuged 
for 90 s at 6,000 g. Serum was diluted with an equal volume of 
sterile PBS, and 100 µl of this dilution was added to individual 
wells of a black 96-well plate. Samples were run in duplicate. 
Fluorescence was measured on a plate reader (SpectraMax; 
Molecular Devices) at an excitation of 481 nm and an emission 
of 524 nm. 
The concentration of FITC-dextran was calculated 
from standard curve measurements run on the same plate.
tight junction Pcr array
RNA was isolated from TRIzol homogenates according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions and was followed by treat-
ment with 1 µg/µl DNase I to eliminate genomic DNA 
(Invitrogen). 1 µg DNase-treated RNA was primed with 
random hexamers (1 µM; Applied Biosystems) and reverse 
transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcription (Ap-
plied Biosystems) in a 20-µl reaction. cDNA was diluted 
1:10 with RNase-free sterile water and loaded onto a 384-
well plate preloaded with primers for tight junction genes 
(PrimePCR Pathway Mouse Tight Junctions 384; Bio-
Rad Laboratories). PCR reactions were performed with 
SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in 10-µl 
reactions on a 7300 system (Applied Biosystems). Melting 
point analyses were performed for each reaction to con-

firm single amplified products. Expression was normalized 
to GAP 
DH for each sample.
Flow cytometry
MLNs and PPs were collected after PBS perfusion (n = 
3–4 per time point; Fig. 2). Tissues were mashed through 
a Falcon 40-µm screen (BD) and washed with RPMI me-
dium. Cells were counted, and 106 cells were used for flow 
cytometry. Cells were first incubated in blocking solution 
(anti-CD16/32 antibody; eBioscience) for 15 min at 4°C 
and then stained with the following antibodies from BD: 
V450-conjugated anti-CD11b, PerCP-Cy5.5–conjugated 
anti-CD4, PE-conjugated CD8, APC-conjugated CD11c, 
and FITC-conjugated B220 for 30 min at 4°C. T reg cells 
were labeled using a mouse T reg cell staining kit (88–8118; 
eBioscience) as per the manufacturer’s instructions (n = 7–8 
per group; Fig. 5). Antibodies include CD4 FITC (RM4-5), 
CD25 PE (PC61.5), and FoxP3 APC (FJK-16S). After stain-
ing was completed, cells were washed and analyzed using a 
FAC 
SCanto II flow cytometer or an LSR 
II flow cytome-
ter with FAC 
SDiva software (BD). Subsequent data analy-
ses were completed using FlowJo software (version 9.6; Tree 
Star). Isotype control antibodies (BD) were matched for flu-
orochrome and used for cursor/gate placement. Data were 
normalized to control group (SCI only) samples analyzed on 
the same day, and data are expressed as a percentage of the 
SCI-only group. Data are presented as the percentage rather 
than the absolute cell number because the amount of start-
ing material (MLNs or PPs) varied between animals (i.e., 
equivalent numbers of MLNs or PPs could not be found or 
isolated from each mouse).
cytokine Pcr
MLNs and PPs were isolated and homogenized into 500 µl 
TRIzol (n = 3–5 per time point; Invitrogen). RNA was iso-
lated from the TRIzol homogenates according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions, followed by treatment with 1 µg/µl 
 
DNase I to eliminate genomic DNA (Invitrogen). 1 µg 
DNase-treated RNA was primed with random hexamers 
(1 µM; Applied Biosystems) and reverse transcribed using 
SuperScript II reverse transcription (Applied Biosystems) in 
a 20-µl reaction. cDNA was stored at −20°C until analysis 
by PCR. Reactions were performed in triplicate using 1 µl 
cDNA/reaction. RNA was analyzed using primers specific to 
the gene of interest and SYBR Green Master Mix in 10-µl 
reactions. All PCR reactions were performed using a 7300 
system, and melting point analyses were performed for each 
reaction to confirm single amplified products. Expression was 
normalized to 18 s for each sample. Primer sequences were

tissue processing
At designated times after injury, mice were anesthetized and 
then perfused intracardially with 100 ml of 0.1 M PBS, pH 
7.4, followed by 100 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PF). Per-
fused spinal cords were immersion fixed in 4% PF for 2 h. 
Fixed tissues were rinsed and stored overnight at 4°C in 
0.2 M phosphate buffer and then cryoprotected in 30% su-
crose for 48 h. Spinal cords were blocked into 1-cm segments 
centered on the impact site and then were embedded in opti-
mum cutting temperature (VWR International). 10-µm serial 
cross sections were cut through each block using a Microm 
cryostat (HM 505 E) and then collected on SuperFrost Plus 
slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −20°C.
Experimentally induced dysbiosis (preinjury) 
and probiotic treatment
T
o induce intestinal dysbiosis, mice were started on antibiotic 
treatment 7 d before SCI. An antibiotic cocktail (2 g/L strep-
tomycin, 0.17 g/L gentamicin, 0.125 mg/L ciprofloxacin, and 
1 g/L bacitracin) was given via drinking water until 11 d after 
injury. Maple syrup was added to both treatment and vehicle 
(control) groups to make water palatable. After 11 dpi, all mice 
were returned to normal drinking water (n = 6 per treatment 
× 2 independent replications). T
o assess the effects of delayed 
dysbiosis on functional recovery (Fig. 5), mice were started 
on antibiotic treatment (2 g/L streptomycin, 0.17 g/L genta-
micin, 0.125 mg/L ciprofloxacin, and 1 g/L bacitracin) 14 d 
 
after SCI and remained on antibiotics for 3 wk (until 35 dpi; 
 
n = 6 per group). Probiotic treatment with VSL#3 (Sigma- 
Tau Pharmaceuticals) was given daily, starting on the day of 
SCI and continuing for 35 dpi (n = 7–8 per group; Fig. 6). 
VSL#3 was reconstituted with sterile water, and a dose of 5 
× 109 bacteria was delivered in 100 µl via oral gavage. Vehi-
cle-treated mice also received a daily oral gavage of 100 µl of 
sterile water. 
VSL#3 contains eight probiotic strains: Lactoba-
cillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, 
Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bifodobacterium 
longum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, and 
Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophiles.
Evans blue dye permeability assay
An antibiotic cocktail (2 g/L streptomycin, 0.17 g/L gentami-
cin, 0.125 mg/L ciprofloxacin, and 1 g/L bacitracin) was given 
to C57BL/6 mice via drinking water for 7 d. Maple syrup 
was added to both treatment (n = 3) and vehicle (control; 
 
n = 3) groups to make water palatable. On day 7, mice were 
injected i.p. with a 2% solution of Evans blue dye at 4 ml/kg. 
 
2 h after injecting Evans blue dye, mice were anesthetized 
and then perfused intracardially with 100 ml of 0.1 M PBS, 
pH 7.4, followed by 100 ml of 4% PF
. Perfused spinal cords 
were postfixed via immersion in 4% PF for 2 h. Fixed tissues 
were rinsed and stored overnight at 4°C in 0.2 M phos-

phate buffer and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 48 h. 
10-µm sections were assessed under a fluorescent microscope 
for the appearance of Evans blue dye, signifying leakage 
into the tissue parenchyma.
Quantitative analysis of lesion volume 
and immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously de-
scribed (Kigerl et al., 2006). Sections were rinsed (0.1 M 
PBS) and then overlaid with blocking serum for 1 h at 
room temperature. Primary antibody (CD11b, MCA-74G 
[AbD Serotec]; CD3, 555273 [BD]; B220/CD45R, MCA 
1258G [AbD Serotec]; and NF-H [NFH Aves Labs]) was 
incubated overnight at 4°C in humidified chambers. Sec-
tions were rinsed with 0.1 M PBS and then overlaid with 
biotinylated conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at 
room temperature. Bound antibody was visualized using 
Elite-ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) with diaminoben-
zidine as a substrate (Vector Laboratories). Immunoperox-
idase-labeled sections were dehydrated through ascending 
alcohols, cleared in histoclear, and then coverslipped with 
Permount (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Eriochrome cyanine 
(EC) staining was used to visualize myelin. Frozen sections 
cut through the rostro-caudal extent of the lesion were in-
cubated in EC for 30 min at 20°C, washed in distilled H2O, 
and then were differentiated in 5% iron alum and then bo-
rax-ferricyanide for 5–10 min. The injury epicenter was 
defined visually as the spinal cord section with the smallest 
visible rim of spared myelin/neurofilament. To calculate 
the lesion volume, digital images of equidistant EC-stained 
sections spanning the injury epicenter were captured using 
an Axioplan 2 Imaging microscope (ZEI 
SS). A point grid 
of the known area was overlaid with random orientation 
onto printed digital images, and myelin sparing was calcu-
lated according to the Cavalieri method using the formula 
V = T · a/p · n∑p, where T equals the distance between 
sections, a/p equals the calculated area per point, and n∑p 
equals the sum of points counted across all sections (Kigerl 
et al., 2006). Lesion area is expressed as the percent lesion 
of the entire cross-sectional area. Microglia/macrophage 
activation was quantified using image analysis as described 
previously (Kigerl et al., 2006). Manual counts of T and 
B cells were done at 40× magnification throughout the 
entire cross section from the epicenter of the lesion site. To 
ensure that individual cells were not doubly counted on 
adjacent sections, profile counts were performed on sec-
tions separated by 200 µm.
Analysis of locomotor function
Open-field locomotor function was assessed using the BMS 
for locomotion (Basso et al., 2006) at 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 
and 35 dpi. In addition, general indices of locomotion and 
activity were assessed with an activity monitor (AccuScan In-
truments). Mice were recorded using the AccuScan system 
for 30 min at 7 and 14 dpi.
online supplemental material
Tables S1, S2, and S3 include raw data obtained from 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing. Specifically, these tables provide raw 
sequence counts for each sample, the number of reads sub-
jected to OTU picking, the reads assigned an OTU, and the 
final number of reads after filtering.
