Abstract 
Abaloparatide-SC is a novel 34–amino acid peptide created to be a potent and selective activator of the 
parathyroid hormone 1 (PTH1) receptor signaling pathway. In the Abaloparatide Comparator Trial In 
Vertebral Endpoints (ACTIVE) Phase 3 trial (NCT01343004) abaloparatide reduced new 
morphometric vertebral fractures by 86% compared with placebo (p < 0.001) and nonvertebral fractures 
by 43% (p = 0.049) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Abaloparatide-SC increased bone 
mineral density (BMD) 3.4% at the total hip, 2.9% at the femoral neck, and 9.2% at the lumbar spine at 
18 months (all p < 0.001 vs placebo). The analysis reported here was designed to evaluate whether 
fracture risk reductions and BMD accrual were consistent across different levels of baseline risk. Risk 
factor subgroups were predefined categorically for BMD T-score of the lumbar spine, total hip, and 
femoral neck (≤ -2.5 vs > -2.5 and ≤ -3.0 vs > -3.0), history of nonvertebral fracture (yes vs no), 
prevalent vertebral fracture (yes vs no), and age (< 65 vs 65 to < 75 vs ≥ 75 years old) at baseline. 
Forest plots show that there were no clinically meaningful interactions between any of the baseline risk 
factors and the treatment effect of abaloparatide-SC on new morphometric vertebral fractures, 
nonvertebral fractures, or BMD increases. Abaloparatide provides protection against fractures 
consistently across a wide variety of ages and baseline risks, including those with and without prior 
fractures, and it has potential utility for a broad group of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

Introduction 
 
Abaloparatide is a novel 34–amino acid peptide created to be a potent and selective activator of 
the parathyroid hormone receptor type 1 (PTHR1) signaling pathway.(1) Abaloparatide is differentiated 
from PTH and parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP) ligands based on its high affinity and 
>1,000-fold greater selectivity for the G protein-dependent receptor (RG) conformation of PTHR1. In 
the Abaloparatide Comparator Trial In Vertebral Endpoints (ACTIVE) Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov 
number NCT01343004),(2) 2463 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were randomized to receive 
double-blind abaloparatide-SC or placebo or to receive open-label teriparatide. Abaloparatide-SC 
increased markers of both formation and resorption, and it increased bone mineral density (BMD) 3.4% 
at the total hip, 2.9% at the femoral neck, and 9.2% at the lumbar spine compared with placebo at 18-
months (p < 0.001 at all 3 sites at 6, 12, and 18 months). Further, compared with teriparatide, treatment 
with abaloparatide-SC increased BMD earlier at nonvertebral sites, approximately 6 months faster at 
total hip and femoral neck. Abaloparatide-SC reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures by 86% and 
nonvertebral fractures by 43% compared with placebo and reduced major osteoporotic fractures 
(clinical spine, wrist, proximal humerus, and hip) by 70% compared with placebo. Kaplan-Meier 
curves for time to first nonvertebral fracture, clinical fracture, and major osteoporotic fracture showed 
early separation between the abaloparatide-SC group and both the placebo and teriparatide groups. The 
curve of the abaloparatide-SC group continued to diverge from the placebo group and maintained 
consistent separation from the teriparatide group over the full course of the 18-month trial.(2) 
 
Osteoanabolic treatment can be considered for patients with osteoporosis at various stages of 
the disease, including patients with prior fractures and those who have very low BMD. In patients with 
a fracture history, especially of recent fractures, imminent risk for subsequent fractures is high.(3-11) 
Such patients need treatment that can produce rapid reduction of risk for further fractures, ultimately 
repair some of the underlying defects in bone tissue, and improve bone mass substantially. For patients 
with very low bone mass but no fracture history, imminent risk may not be high, but long-term fracture

4 
risk remains high.(12) In such patients, beginning osteoporosis therapy with an osteoanabolic medication 
may be the most efficient way to achieve ultimate BMD goals.(13)  
 
To demonstrate that abaloparatide-SC can produce benefits against fracture occurrence and 
improve BMD in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and varying baseline risks for fracture, we 
assessed the effects of abaloparatide-SC in prespecified subgroups from the ACTIVE trial categorized 
by baseline BMD, prior fracture history, and age.  
Materials and Methods 
 
Postmenopausal women aged 49 to 86 years were enrolled in the ACTIVE trial if they had a 
radiographically confirmed vertebral fracture or a history of nonvertebral fracture within the preceding 
5 years, in addition to a BMD T-score ≤ -2.5 at the lumbar spine or hip or ≤ -2.0 for those above age 65 
years. Women above age 65 years were also enrolled without prior fracture if they had a BMD T-score 
≤ -3.0. Exclusions have been detailed previously.(2) Participants were randomized to blinded 
abaloparatide-SC 80 μg or blinded placebo by daily subcutaneous injection or to open-label teriparatide 
20 μg by daily subcutaneous injection. BMD was measured at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar 
spine at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. New morphometric vertebral fractures were assessed as 
previously described, and nonvertebral fractures were confirmed and adjudicated by review of medical 
and radiographic records.(2) 
Analyses 
 
Subgroups were prospectively defined during the design of the ACTIVE trial based on 
knowledge of interactions seen with other medications and baseline risk category.(14,15) Here, a total of 
9 subgroups were categorized by baseline BMD T-scores using 2 cut points (≤ -2.5 vs > -2.5 and ≤ -3.0 
vs > -3.0) at lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. Participants were also categorized into 3 age 
groups (< 65, 65 to < 75, and ≥ 75 years of age) and were subgrouped by confirmed radiographic 
vertebral fracture (yes vs no) and prior nonvertebral fracture (yes vs no). Subgroup analyses were

performed to evaluate effects of abaloparatide-SC vs placebo (subgroup analyses were not planned for 
evaluation of the open-label teriparatide arm of the trial). 
 
For each of the 9 subgroups evaluated, relative risk ratios for new vertebral fractures were 
calculated, hazard ratios for nonvertebral fractures were determined, and least-squares mean 
differences in BMD accrual in the abaloparatide-SC vs placebo groups for each skeletal site were 
calculated. Forest plots were produced for subgroups to determine if there were qualitative treatment-
by-subgroup interactions. Qualitative and quantitative treatment-subgroup interactions were assessed 
by the Breslow Day test for vertebral fractures, Cox Proportional Hazards model for nonvertebral 
fractures, and an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model for BMD. Analyses for interactions were 
not controlled for covariates other than subgroup, treatment, and treatment by subgroup interaction in 
the Cox model. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) manufacturer and baseline BMD were 
included in the ANCOVA model for BMD. Missing postbaseline BMD values were imputed using the 
last observation carried forward method according to the prespecified statistical analysis plan. P-values 
were not adjusted for multiple comparisons and were considered significant if p < 0.05. 
Results 
The characteristics of the population have been described in detail previously.(2) Mean age was 
69 years, with about 18.8% of participants younger than 65 years and 19% of the population 75 years 
or older. About 37.4% had no prior fractures, 23.8% had a confirmed prevalent vertebral fracture, and 
48.4% had a prior nonvertebral fracture. Mean lumbar spine BMD T-score was -2.9, mean total hip T-
score was -1.9, and mean femoral neck T-score was -2.1. All subgroups were well matched across the 
abaloparatide-SC and placebo groups, although some of the subgroups were small. 
Subgroup results for vertebral and nonvertebral fractures

subgroups, abaloparatide-SC reduced vertebral fractures with an effect size that approximated the 
overall 86% reduction in relative risk. In five of the subgroups, the upper limit of the 95% confidence 
interval was above 1.0 due to either small numbers of participants or small numbers of events in those 
subgroups. The effect of abaloparatide on vertebral fracture reduction was consistent across all 
subgroups. No significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions (p > 0.10 for all interaction tests) were 
seen for vertebral fracture relative risk reduction. 
 
Figure 2 displays the Forest plot for hazard ratios for nonvertebral fractures in abaloparatide-
SC- vs placebo-treated participants for each subgroup. Hazard ratios were < 1.0 for all subgroups. The 
effect size (overall 43% risk reduction) was consistent across each subgroup, with no significant 
interactions (p > 0.08 for all interaction tests) seen for nonvertebral fracture risk reduction. Multiple 
subgroups had 95% confidence intervals (CI) that crossed 1.0; these subgroups tended to have either 
smaller numbers of participants or small numbers of events in those groups. 
 
Figures 3A, 3B, and 3C illustrate the least-squares mean difference in percent change from 
baseline in BMD at 18 months for the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck in abaloparatide-SC- vs 
placebo-treated participants by subgroup. The effect on lumbar spine BMD was consistent across 
subgroups, with one quantitative interaction (p = 0.036) seen due to a higher incremental BMD gain in 
one subgroup: lumbar spine BMD gain vs placebo was 9.9% in the subgroup with total hip T-score 
≤ -2.5 vs 8.4% in the subgroup with T-score > -2.5. Differences in BMD gain in abaloparatide-SC- vs 
placebo-treated participants for the total hip were consistent across all subgroups with no treatment-by-
subgroup interactions (p > 0.06 for all interaction tests). Femoral neck BMD data were very similar to 
those of the total hip. 
Discussion 
 
Our findings illustrate that abaloparatide-SC provides consistent fracture risk reductions in all 
prespecified risk subgroups for both new morphometric vertebral fractures and nonvertebral fractures.

Further, abaloparatide-SC produces consistent improvements in BMD of the lumbar spine, total hip, 
and femoral neck regardless of baseline risk. No meaningful interactions were seen among baseline risk 
factor subgroups and treatment effects. 
 
Our findings for nonvertebral fracture outcomes were more consistent than those seen for 
alendronate in the clinical fracture arm of the Fracture Intervention Trial.(14) In that investigation, 
however, one cohort of the study population did not have a diagnosis of osteoporosis. In contrast, all 
the participants in the ACTIVE study had osteoporosis defined by either BMD and/or fracture criteria.  
 
In the Health Outcomes and Reduced Incidence with Zoledronic Acid Once Yearly 
(HORIZON) Recurrent Fracture trial (all participants had prior hip fractures), quantitative (but not 
qualitative) interactions were seen between 1-year femoral neck BMD increments with zoledronic acid 
and time of infusion as well as prior fracture history.(16) In contrast, in the HORIZON pivotal fracture 
trial, zoledronic acid treatment was more effective against vertebral fracture in younger women, 
women with higher body mass index, and those with normal renal function, but there were no 
interactions between baseline subgroups and effect of zoledronic acid on nonvertebral fracture or BMD 
change.(17)  
 
Our findings showing consistent effectiveness of abaloparatide-SC to reduce nonvertebral 
fractures regardless of BMD, prior fracture history, and age also differ from the subgroup analysis of 
the Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM) trial 
evaluating the effect of denosumab on nonvertebral fractures.(15) In that study, an interaction on 
nonvertebral fracture was seen for body mass index (p = 0.013), femoral neck BMD (p = 0.023), and 
prevalent vertebral fracture (p = 0.038). 
 
The skeletal response to teriparatide was assessed in a phase 3 clinical trial that compared 
teriparatide to placebo.(18) In women older than 65 years, treatment resulted in a greater increase in 
vertebral BMD than in younger women (p = 0.037), but baseline age had no effect on the relative risk 
reduction for vertebral fractures. In that study, BMD was divided into tertiles (< -3.3, -3.3 to -2.1, and

> -2.1), and teriparatide significantly decreased vertebral fracture risk in participants with a vertebral 
BMD T-score of < -3.3 or a score between -2.1 and -3.3 but not in those in the highest BMD tertile. 
The study had a more severely affected patient population than the ACTIVE trial, since on average, 
women had 2 or more vertebral fractures at baseline.  
 
The populations for all these studies are different, and recruitment criteria for entry into the 
trials were distinct. However, it is possible that the difference in consistency of effect relates to the 
greater overall effect size with abaloparatide or to differences in the mechanisms of action of the drugs.  
 
The limitations of the current study are similar to those of other subgroup studies in which 
statistical significance was considered without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Also, several of 
the subgroups were either small or had few events, limitations that are difficult to exclude given the 
trial design, and the study was powered to detect effects of abaloparatide on vertebral fractures in the 
whole study population but not in subgroups. 
 
The strengths of the study include the multiple important clinical outcomes of new vertebral and 
nonvertebral fractures as well as BMD. The predefined subgroups also included a broad range of 
postmenopausal women with and without prior fracture. 
 
We conclude that abaloparatide has the potential to reduce vertebral and nonvertebral fracture 
occurrence and to improve BMD in a broad population of candidate postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis, regardless of age, prior fracture history, or BMD.
