 Abstract 
28 
The impacts of pesticides, and in particular of neonicotinoids, on bee health remain much 
29 
debated. Many studies describing negative effects have been criticised as the experimental 
30 
protocol did not perfectly simulate real-life field scenarios. Here, we placed free-flying 
31 
bumblebee colonies next to raspberry crops that were either untreated or treated with the 
32 
neonicotinoid thiacloprid as part of normal farming practice. Colonies were exposed to the 
33 
raspberry crops for a two week period before being relocated to either a flower-rich or 
34 
flower-poor site.  Overall, exposed colonies were more likely to die prematurely, and those 
35 
that survived reached a lower final weight and produced 46% fewer reproductives than 
36 
colonies placed at control farms.  The impact was more marked at the flower-rich site (all 
37 
colonies performed poorly at the flower poor site).  Analysis of nectar and pollen stores from 
38 
bumblebee colonies placed at the same raspberry farms revealed thiacloprid residues of up to 
39 
771ppb in pollen and up to 561ppb in nectar. The image of thiacloprid as a relatively benign 
40 
neonicotinoid should now be questioned.   
 
41 
 Introduction 
42 
Concerns have been growing about declines in bumblebee diversity and range in both Europe 
43 
and North America, and the potential consequences for natural ecosystems and for food 
44 
security1,2.  While the causes of declines are likely to be multifactorial, recent studies 
45 
describing the negative impacts of a group of systemic pesticides, the neonicotinoids, on 
46 
foraging in honeybees and bumblebees, and on fecundity and colony success in bumblebees, 
47 
have garnered widespread interest (e.g.3-9). These studies informed the European Union 
48 
decision in 2013 to suspend use of the three most widely used neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, 
49 
thiamethoxam and clothianidin) on flowering crops attractive to bees for 2 years, a 
50 
suspension which has since been extended.    
51 
The studies that led to these restrictions have attracted criticism in some quarters 
52 
because they were partly conducted in a laboratory setting, because bees were forced to 
53 
consume treated food, and/or because bees were exposed to unrealistic concentrations of 
54 
neonicotinoids10.  Here, we describe a field study of the impacts of a neonicotinoid on 
55 
bumblebee colonies in which bees were free-flying throughout, so that they were free to 
56 
choose where to forage, and in which the pesticide applications followed normal farming 
57 
practice. After exposure to the treated or untreated crop for two weeks, colonies were moved 
58 
to either a flower-poor or flower-rich site, to examine how proximity to good forage mediated 
59 
any impacts of pesticide exposure. The experiment is intended to be realistic of the scenario 
60 
in which a wild bumblebee nest is situated near to a treated crop.   
61 
We focus here on the impacts of a less-studied neonicotinoid, thiacloprid, which has 
62 
considerably lower toxicity to honeybees than the neonicotinoids that are the subject of the 
63 
EU moratorium11.  It is often described as “bee-safe” and hence suitable for use on flowering 
64 
crops, in horticulture, and for garden use12. However, it has been found to cause elevated 
65 
 mortality in honeybees, especially when combined with other stressors such as pathogens13-14, 
66 
and also to impair navigation15-16. There have been no previous attempts to evaluate the 
67 
impact of this chemical on whole colonies of bees under field-realistic exposure.

Methods 
70 
Colony placement and monitoring 
71 
Fifty-four commercially reared colonies of Bombus terrestris audax (Biobest N.V., Belgium) 
72 
were obtained on 15 June 2012 and randomly assigned to treatments in a full factorial design 
73 
(controls or exposed to the neonicotinoid thiacloprid, flower-poor or flower-rich habitats). 
74 
There was no difference in weight between the colonies at the beginning of the experiment 
75 
(T-test, t(33)=1.16, p=0.255). Colonies were initially kept in the grounds of the University of 
76 
Stirling campus in an area comprising woodland, amenity grasslands, improved pasture, and 
77 
ornamental gardens (for 0-21 days, see below).  
78 
A network of nine raspberry farmers in Perthshire and Angus (central Scotland) took part in 
79 
the study. All raspberries were grown in polythene tunnels (polytunnels), all of which were open-
80 
ended, some were open-sided while others had closed sides.  Pollination of raspberries in this region 
81 
is delivered by a mixture of wild bumblebees of a range of species, honeybees and flies, supplemented 
82 
on some farms with commercial colonies of Bombus terrestris (Lye et al. 2011; Ellis et al. in press).   
83 
Farmers informed us when they were about to spray a flowering raspberry crop with 
84 
thiacloprid. No other insecticides were used on the farms in the year of our study. At each 
85 
farm using thiacloprid, six colonies were placed at the ends of the rows of raspberries, within 
86 
1m of the flowering crop, as soon as possible after spraying (between 0 and 4 days, table S1).  
87 
On the same day another six colonies were placed within 1 m of flowering raspberries on a 
88 
 control farm that was not spraying within the next two weeks and had not previously applied 
89 
an insecticide in 2012.  Control farms were matched by size of soft fruit operation and where 
90 
possible, geographical area (table S1).  However, it is important to note that treatments were 
91 
not randomized; we could not randomly allocate farms to treatments and dictate whether and 
92 
when thiacloprid would be sprayed. Between 15th June and 5th July, five batches each of six 
93 
colonies were deployed on five treated farms (30 colonies in total), and four batches of six 
94 
colonies simultaneously placed adjacent to unsprayed raspberries on four control farms (24 
95 
colonies in total).  The numbers of control and treatment are uneven as equal numbers of 
96 
suitable control farms could not always be found to match the same time periods as treated 
97 
farms, within the required geographical area, and of a similar farm size and management 
98 
style.  All farmers applied thiacloprid at the recommended manufacturer spray rate (up to 
99 
250mL/ha of Calypso 480 g/l thiacloprid).  Bees in colonies were allowed to forage at the 
100 
farms for two weeks.  After the two week exposure period, colonies were removed from 
101 
farms and randomly assigned to either the University campus or a site on flowering heather 
102 
moorland approximately 5 km from the University. Colonies from different farms were 
103 
placed at least 30m apart to minimise drifting between the colonies17.  The University campus 
104 
is probably reasonably typical of lowland UK, having relatively few floral resources in July 
105 
and August, while the moorland site provided extensive dense patches of flowering Calluna 
106 
vulgaris and Erica spp..   
107 
Colonies were all weighed at the beginning of the experiment, and weekly throughout 
108 
the experiment, apart from during the exposure period at the farms when they were not 
109 
disturbed for two weeks. Weighing was conducted at night to ease handling, minimise 
110 
disturbance and to ensure that most bees were present in the colony. The colonies were also 
111 
checked for signs of poor health; 19 colonies died before the end of the experiment and hence 
112 
 were not available for analysis of nest performance. Thirteen of these deaths were due to 
113 
heavy infestation with wax moths (Aphomia sociella).  
114 
Dissections 
115 
At termination of the experiment, the surviving colonies were dissected and the following 
116 
recorded: numbers of adult bees of each caste; numbers of pupae identifiable as future 
117 
queens, males or workers; other pupae; empty pupal cells; numbers of dead bees.  Bees that 
118 
were dead before freezing are readily distinguished as they have matted fur, are often partly 
119 
decayed, and are invariably located away from the comb around the periphery of the nest 
120 
box, whereas live bees cluster together in the centre of the nest as the temperature drops.  
121 
Reproductive output was calculated as the sum of queens and queen pupae plus 0.5 times the 
122 
number of males and male pupae (since males are haploid).  
123 
Quantifying exposure to thiacloprid 
124 
We did not have funds or facilities for testing pesticide residues in 2012, and thus we did not 
125 
collect samples. In 2013 we acquired access to suitable analytical facilities, and so we placed 
126 
bumblebee nests on six of the nine farms used for the 2012 experiment, selecting only farms 
127 
that were intending to spray thiacloprid. As before, nests were placed at the ends of the rows 
128 
of raspberries, within 1m of the flowering crop, on 7 May 2013. Spraying with thiacloprid 
129 
followed normal farming practice and commenced in mid June (approximately 6 weeks after 
130 
the nests were placed in the field). When sufficient food stores were present in the nest, 
131 
>100mg samples of nectar and pollen were collected 4, 8 and 10 weeks after nests were 
132 
placed in the field. These were analysed for thiacloprid using methods slightly modified from 
133 
Botias et al.18 (see Supplementary Appendix 2). It should be noted that in our 2012 
134 
experiment colonies were placed on farms immediately after spraying, whereas in 2013 
135 
 colonies were in place before spraying (a more field-realistic scenario). We might thus expect 
136 
residues to be higher in 2013 than those that were experienced by experimental nests in 2012. 
137 
Statistical analysis 
138 
All statistics analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS 21.  To assess the impact of treatment on 
139 
measures of colony success, generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) were fitted to the 
140 
data with farm as a random factor. Explanatory factors within the model were final colony 
141 
weight, treatment, location during the post-exposure period (“flower-rich” versus “flower-
142 
poor”) and the interaction between these. Response variables were number of workers 
143 
remaining in the colony, number of males produced (adults plus pupae), number of queens 
144 
produced (adults plus pupae), and reproductive success (as described above). The model for 
145 
colony weight was fitted using normal errors, while the remainder of analyses used gamma 
146 
errors and a log link, with error structure chosen to minimise Akaike values. We also 
147 
conducted a more conservative GLM analysis, identical to that described above but instead of 
148 
treating nests as replicated and including farm as a random factor, we used the average value 
149 
for each response variable across all nests placed at a particular farm / subsequent location 
150 
(flower rich/ flower poor) combination.  
151 
Differences in colony failure rates between exposed and control colonies were 
152 
examined using a χ2 test of association. 
153 
Results  
154 
We found a number of significant interactions between the effects of pesticide exposure and 
155 
the subsequent location of colonies (flower-rich or flower-poor sites) on colony performance. 
156 
Broadly, colonies that were not exposed to thiacloprid and were then placed at the flower-rich 
157 
site performed better than those in any other treatment combination (Figure 1, Table 1). 
158 
 Colonies placed at the flower-poor site performed poorly regardless of pesticide treatment. 
159 
For example, there was a significant treatment x site interaction on final colony weight; at the 
160 
flower rich site the control colonies were 10% heavier than the exposed colonies (mean ± se 
161 
of 780g ± 27.0 versus 709g ± 14.7), whereas at the flower poor site colony weights were low 
162 
in both exposed and control colonies (overall mean of 701 g ± 16.6; Figure 1a). Similarly, 
163 
there was a significant treatment x site interaction for the reproductive output of the colonies 
164 
(measured as the number of new adult queens and queen pupae plus half the number of males 
165 
and male pupae; Table 1, Figure 1b). Overall, reproductive output was 46% lower in treated 
166 
colonies compared to controls (mean ± s.e. 23.9 ± 4.6 versus 13.0 ± 3.3, respectively), but the 
167 
difference was more marked at the flower-rich site (Figure 1b). When analysed separately, 
168 
the same pattern was observed for male production (Figure 1c), but not for queens; queen 
169 
production was very low in all treatments (overall mean ± s.e.; new queens = 1.66 ± 0.47, 
170 
queen pupae = 3.48 ± 0.59, Figure 1d). There were no treatment or site effects on the 
171 
numbers of workers remaining in the colonies at the end of the experiment (Table 1). When 
172 
response variables were subjected to a more conservative analysis in which farm (rather than 
173 
nest) was treated as the unit of replication, patterns were broadly similar; there was a 
174 
significant negative effect of treatment on reproductive output of colonies, and a strong 
175 
interaction between treatment and subsequent nest location (flower rich or poor) (Table S2). 
176 
However, using this approach the negative effect of treatment on colony growth was not 
177 
significant (Table S2).      
178 
Marginally more of the colonies exposed to thiacloprid failed (14/30) before the end 
179 
of the experiment compared to controls (5/24) (χ21 = 3.89, p<0.05). 
180 
 
Of the nine nests placed out in 2013, we were able to obtain sufficient samples of 
181 
food stores for chemical analysis of one pollen and six nectar samples at four weeks, three 
182 
nectar and five pollen samples at eight weeks, and five pollen samples at 10 weeks. No 
183 
 thiacloprid was detected in nectar and very little in pollen at 4 weeks (4/6/13), which is as we 
184 
would expect because this is before thiacloprid spraying commences. At eight and ten weeks 
185 
(approximately 2 and 4 weeks after spraying with thiacloprid) residues of thiacloprid were 
186 
detected in most pollen and nectar samples (up to 771 ppb in pollen and up to 561 ppb in 
187 
nectar, Table 2).  
188 
Discussion 
189 
We found that bumblebee colonies exposed to thiacloprid are more likely to fail, and that 
190 
those which survive reach a lower final weight and produced fewer reproductives than 
191 
control colonies. These difference were more marked when colonies were placed in a flower-
192 
rich site in which control colonies thrived. Few previous experiments have studied the 
193 
impacts of neonicotinoids on bee colony performance where the bees were exposed to 
194 
pesticides while foraging on real crop-fields (rather than experimental plots), were free-flying 
195 
throughout the experiment, and the pesticide application followed normal farming practice at 
196 
working farms. Cutler and Scott-Dupree20 conducted a similar experiment with colonies of 
197 
the bumblebee B. impatiens placed next to clothianidin or thiamethoxam-treated or untreated 
198 
corn and found few negative effects, although there were fewer workers in exposed colonies. 
199 
However, bumblebees rarely forage on corn so none of the nests are likely to have received 
200 
significant exposure. Rundlöf et al.9 found that growth of bumblebee colonies and their 
201 
reproductive output was significantly impaired when placed next to fields of oilseed rape 
202 
treated with clothianidin; similar findings to ours. They also found strong negative impacts on 
203 
solitary bees, but no significant impact on honeybee colonies. No similar experiment has 
204 
previously been performed with thiacloprid. Like oilseed rape, bumblebees are highly 
205 
attracted to raspberry flowers21. Our study replicates the common scenario of exposure when 
206 
a wild bumblebee colony is situated close to a commercial raspberry crop, or when 
207 
commercial colonies are placed next to such crops. The colonies were moved two weeks after 
208 
 first exposure; normally, for wild and managed bumblebees residing in the farm landscape, 
209 
colonies would be exposed to the treated crop for longer than two weeks, and might be 
210 
subject to further pesticide applications. They would also be present when the crops were 
211 
actually sprayed, rather than being placed next to crops after spraying. As our sites were 
212 
working farms, we could not always anticipate when a farm would use thiacloprid and so 
213 
colonies were first exposed between 0 and 4 days after the spray day (table S1), which again 
214 
would reduce the expected exposure relative to naturally occurring colonies. In these respects 
215 
our study likely underestimates exposure of bumblebee colonies to thiacloprid on working 
216 
farms. However, it should also be noted that we were unable to randomly allocate farms to 
217 
treatments. It is thus possible that farms using thiacloprid may have differed in other farming 
218 
practices from control farms (although we attempted to match control farms as closely as 
219 
possible), and if so this could conceivably confound results. In addition, wild bumblebee 
220 
nests are unlikely to be as close to the crop as ours were, and in this respect our study might 
221 
represent a worst-case scenario.  
222 
It is notable that all colonies produced few queens. A similar study using the same 
223 
“flower-poor” site in 2011 recorded a mean of ~14 queens per control colony6, but the 
224 
weather in the summer of 2012 was the wettest in the UK for 100 years (Met Office, 2012), 
225 
which may account for this difference. Our colonies were also subject to the dual disturbance 
226 
of movement to and from the raspberry farms, which might have impaired their performance 
227 
compared to those in Whitehorn et al.6.   
228 
 
 We did not investigate the mechanisms by which thiacloprid reduced colony 
229 
performance in our study, but previous studies on other neonicotinoids may shed light on this. 
230 
Exposure to thiamethoxam was found to impair navigation in honeybees4 and reduce pollen 
231 
collection in bumblebees22 while exposure to imidacloprid has been found to reduce pollen 
232 
collection3,23,24 and reduce egg laying in bumblebees5.  Honeybees fed thiacloprid at sublethal 
233 
 doses were found to fly more slowly15, and foraging behaviour, navigation performance and 
234 
social communication were all impaired16.  A study monitoring foraging honeybees exposed 
235 
to thiacloprid in polythene tunnels found a drop in foraging activity after thiacloprid was 
236 
sprayed, but this did not lead to hive level effects25. It has, however, been noted that the 
237 
power to detect differences in this study was low due to a small number of replicates26. In 
238 
addition, honeybee hives may be expected to be more resilient to short-term perturbations 
239 
than bumblebee colonies, as honeybees colonies typically hold over 30,000 workers, 
240 
compared to perhaps 50 to 200 in bumblebee colonies.   
241 
We found marked differences in colony performance between the ‘flower-poor’ and 
242 
‘flower-rich’ sites. These differences may have been due to any number of differences 
243 
between sites (e.g. microclimate, local pathogen community), and we could only be sure that 
244 
they were due to floral availability if we had many replicates of each habitat type. However, 
245 
the direct effect of differences in food availability between sites would seem to be the most 
246 
likely explanation. Despite very poor weather, control colonies at the ‘flower-rich’ site were 
247 
presumably able to gather sufficient food and hence performed relatively well, while the 
248 
treated colonies performed poorly perhaps because they were unable to efficiently harvest 
249 
these resources.  All colonies performed poorly in our flower-poor area, presumably because 
250 
there was simply not enough food.       
251 
Our study builds on evidence of the impacts of neonicotinoids on bumblebees gained 
252 
in laboratory and semi-field settings.  By monitoring bees which were free to forage either on 
253 
the crop or elsewhere, we can better infer the impacts of neonicotinoids on colonies in natural 
254 
settings.  It would have been valuable to quantify the exposure of nests in each treatment, for 
255 
example by sampling and analysing food stores from the nests, but at the time the experiment 
256 
was performed we did not have funding or facilities for such analysis, which is expensive. 
257 
We cannot be sure that control colonies were not also exposed to additional neonicotinoids by 
258 
 foragers travelling to nearby farms; although the average foraging distance of bees is modest 
259 
in rewarding landscapes (~750m; 27), foragers can travel considerable distances28-30.  Soft-
260 
fruit farms can be considered “rewarding” landscapes particularly as raspberries are 
261 
extremely attractive to bees, with high densities of wild bumblebees recorded on raspberries 
262 
plants within the study region21.  Therefore it is unlikely that bees would have had to travel 
263 
far for forage.  However, recent reviews have confirmed that neonicotinoids and other 
264 
pesticides, particularly fungicides, are prevalent throughout farmed landscapes, so we cannot 
265 
rule out the possibility that our bees were exposed to additional pesticides18,31,32. However, 
266 
this would presumably have affected both treatment groups equally. Regardless of any such 
267 
additional exposure, our experimental scenario accurately mimics the situation in which a 
268 
bumblebee nest is situated close to a raspberry crop. The only difference between pesticide 
269 
treatments groups was in whether the crop was sprayed with thiacloprid or not, and hence the 
270 
marked difference in colony performance between treatment groups strongly indicates that 
271 
applications of thiacloprid can have a negative impact on bumblebee colony performance 
272 
under realistic field conditions. 
273 
By placing nests on nine farms using thiacloprid in 2013 and analysing their food 
274 
stores we were able to confirm that bees in this environment are indeed exposed to pesticide 
275 
residues; concentrations were variable, but sometimes were very high (up to 771 ppb in 
276 
pollen). This is in the region of two orders of magnitude higher than concentrations of 
277 
neonicotinoids in nectar and pollen of seed-treated crops18.  Thiacloprid has considerably 
278 
lower toxicity to honeybees than some other neonicotinoids; for example the LD50 by topical 
279 
application is 14,600 ng/bee for thiacloprid compared to 18 ng/bee for imidacloprid11.  As a 
280 
result it has been described as “bee-safe” and hence suitable for use on flowering crops; it is 
281 
widely used in horticulture and is also the predominant insecticide sold for garden use in 
282 
Europe12.  It is not covered by the EU moratorium, so some countries are moving towards 
283 
 increasing the use of thiacloprid in response to the restrictions on other neonicotinoids. 
284 
However spray application rates are much higher than those used in seed dressings and are 
285 
less uniform33, and our results demonstrate clearly that bee nests near a treated crop can be 
286 
exposed to high concentrations of thiacloprid.  High concentrations of thiacloprid have also 
287 
been found in pollen in honeybee hives in Germany (up to 199 ppb)34, and a mean 
288 
concentration of 89.1 ppb of thiacloprid was found in apple pollen within honeybee hives in 
289 
Poland35.  Enhanced worker mortality has been found in laboratory studies when bumblebees 
290 
were fed thiacloprid at the much lower concentration of 12 ppb36, suggesting that foliar 
291 
sprays of this chemical should be treated with the same caution as other neonicotinoids.  
292 
There is also evidence that thiacloprid is particularly potent when combined with 
293 
other stressors such as fungicides, parasites and nutrient stress11,37,38.  A laboratory study that 
294 
exposed honeybees to thiacloprid and the commonly-used plant fungicide triflumizole found 
295 
that this compound increased the potency of thiacloprid by 1,141 fold, decreasing the LD50 to 
296 
12.8 ng/bee11. Honeybees exposed to doses of thiacloprid of 1/100th of the LD50 died more 
297 
quickly when infected with the protozoan parasite Nosema ceranae than those with the 
298 
parasite alone38.  Honeybees fed thiacloprid when starved were more likely to die relative to 
299 
controls, suggesting that nutrient deficiency could enhance lethal effects37. An environment 
300 
with fungicides, parasites and occasional nutrient stress are likely to be the norm for free-
301 
flying bees; 97.3% of samples from wax, pollen, and bee bread from North American 
302 
honeybees contained two or more pesticides39, so the effective LD50 for thiacloprid in the 
303 
field may be lower than expected.   
304 
 
The current study is the first study to find effects of thiacloprid on freely foraging bee 
305 
colonies.  It shows that types of neonicotinoids regarded as “bee safe” because of their 
306 
relatively low toxicity are legally used at concentration that can harm bumblebee colonies. 
307 
 The long-term impact of such use on wild bee populations and the pollination services they 
308 
provide in fruit-growing areas should be given due consideration.

Chemicals and reagents 
493 
Certified standards of thiacloprid (> 99% compound purity) and imidacloprid-d4 (> 97% 
494 
isotopic purity), and formic acid, ammonium formate, magnesium sulphate, sodium acetate and 
495 
SupelTMQuE PSA/C18/ENVI-Carb were obtained from Sigma Aldrich UK. HPLC grade 
496 
acetonitrile and water were obtained from Rathburns UK. Individual standard pesticide (native 
497 
and deuterated) stock solutions (1 mg/ml) were prepared in acetonitrile (ACN). Calibration 
498 
points in H20:ACN (90:10) were prepared weekly from the stock solutions. All stocks were 
499 
stored at -20oC in the dark.  
500 
 
501 
Sample preparation for neonicotinoid analyses 
502 
Pollen 
503 
Pollen samples were extracted as described in Botias et al. (2015). Briefly, one hundred 
504 
milligrams of pollen sample was weighed into an Eppendorf tube, 400 pg of deuterated 
505 
pesticide in ACN were added and the samples were extracted using the QuEChERS method. 
506 
First, 400 µl of water was added to form an emulsion and samples were then extracted by 
507 
adding 500 µl of ACN and mixing on a multi axis rotator for 10 minutes. Then, 125 mg of 
508 
magnesium sulphate: sodium acetate mix (4:1) was added to each tube and after centrifugation; 
509 
the supernatant was removed into a clean Eppendorf tube containing 125 mg of 
510 
PSA/C18/ENVI-Carb. After the first extraction, the aqueous phase and resuspended pellet were 
511 
extracted again with 400 µl of ACN and the supernatants combined. Extracts were mixed with 
512 
PSA/C18/ENVI-Carb (10 min) and centrifuged (10 min). The supernatant was evaporated to 
513 
dryness under vacuum, reconstituted with 120 µl ACN:H2O (10:90) and spin filtered (0.22 
514 
µm). 
515 
  
516 
Nectar 
517 
Nectar samples were centrifuged at 13,000 relative centrifugal force (RCF) for 10 min to 
518 
remove pollen and plant debris and the supernatant transferred into a clean eppendorf tube. 
519 
Nectar samples were very viscous and were therefore weighted for more accuracy (175 ± 50 
520 
mg depending on availability). Four hundred pg of deuterated pesticide standard mixture was 
521 
added to the nectar and the samples were extracted using the same QuEChERS method than 
522 
described previously for pollen.  
523 
 
524 
UHPLC-MS/MS analyses 
525 
The Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-
526 
MS/MS) method described in Botias et al. (2015) was used for the analysis of samples. 
527 
UHPLC-MS/MS analyses were carried out using a Waters Acquity UHPLC system coupled to 
528 
a Quattro Premier triple quadrupole mass spectrometer from Micromass (Waters, Manchester, 
529 
UK). Samples were separated using a reverse phase Acquity UHPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 
530 
μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm, Waters, Manchester, UK) fitted with a ACQUITY UHPLC BEH C18 
531 
VanGuard pre-column (130Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm X 5 mm, Waters, Manchester, UK). Injection 
532 
volume was 20 µl and mobile phase solvents were 95% water, 5% ACN, 5 mM ammonium 
533 
formate, 0.1% formic acid (A) and 95% ACN, 5% water, 5 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% 
534 
formic acid (B). Initial ratio (A:B) was 90:10 and separation was achieved using a flow rate of 
535 
0.2 ml/min with the following gradient: 90:10 to 70:30 in 10 min; then from 70:30 to 0:100 in 
536 
two minutes and held for 7 min, and return to initial condition and equilibration for 7 min.  
537 
MS/MS was performed in Multiple Reaction Mode (MRM) using ESI in the positive mode and 
538 
two characteristic fragmentations of the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+ were monitored. 
539 
 Retention times, ionisation and fragmentation settings are reported in Table S3. Data were 
540 
acquired using MassLynx 4.1 and the quantification was carried out by calculating the response 
541 
factor of thiacloprid compounds to imidacloprid-d4. Concentrations were determined using a 
542 
least-square linear regression analysis of the peak area ratio versus the concentration ratio 
543 
(native to deuterated). At least five point calibration curves (R2> 0.99) were used to cover the 
544 
range of concentrations observed in the different matrices for all compounds, within the linear 
545 
range of the instrument. The very high THC concentrations (i.e. >100 ppb) were calculated 
546 
using an external calibration. Method detection and quantification limits (MDL and MQL, 
547 
respectively) as well as recoveries were determined as described in Botias et al. (2015) and are 
548 
given respectively in Table S4 and S5. 
549 
 
550 
Quality control 
551 
One blank workup sample (i.e. solvent without matrix) per batch of twelve samples was 
552 
included and injected on the UHPLC-MS/MS to ensure that no contamination occurred during 
553 
the sample preparation. Solvent samples were also injected between sample batches to ensure 
554 
that there was no carryover in the UHPLC system that might affect adjacent results in analytical 
555 
runs. Samples were analysed in a random order and QC samples (i.e. standards) were injected 
556 
during runs every 10 samples to check the sensitivity of the machine. Identities of thiacloprid 
557 
was confirmed by comparing ratio of MRM transitions in samples and pure standards.
