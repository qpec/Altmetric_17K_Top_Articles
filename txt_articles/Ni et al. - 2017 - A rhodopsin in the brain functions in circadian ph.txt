A rhodopsin in the brain functions in circadian 
photoentrainment in Drosophila
Jinfei D. Ni1,2, Lisa S. Baik3, Todd C. Holmes3,4 & Craig montell1
Animals partition their daily activity rhythms through their 
internal circadian clocks, which are synchronized by oscillating 
day–night cycles of light. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster 
senses day–night cycles in part through rhodopsin-dependent 
light reception in the compound eye and photoreceptor cells in the 
Hofbauer–Buchner eyelet1. A more noteworthy light entrainment 
pathway is mediated by central pacemaker neurons in the brain. 
The Drosophila circadian clock is extremely sensitive to light. 
However, the only known light sensor in pacemaker neurons, the 
flavoprotein cryptochrome (Cry)2,3, responds only to high levels of 
light in vitro4. These observations indicate that there is an additional 
light-sensing pathway in fly pacemaker neurons5. Here we describe 
a previously uncharacterized rhodopsin, Rh7, which contributes 
to circadian light entrainment by circadian pacemaker neurons 
in the brain. The pacemaker neurons respond to violet light, and 
this response depends on Rh7. Loss of either cry or rh7 caused 
minor defects in photoentrainment, whereas loss of both caused 
profound impairment. The circadian photoresponse to constant 
light was impaired in rh7 mutant flies, especially under dim light. 
The demonstration that Rh7 functions in circadian pacemaker 
neurons represents, to our knowledge, the first role for an opsin in 
the central brain.
Cry is a light detector in central pacemaker neurons that contributes 
to phototrainment3,6. However, cry mutant flies still entrain to light–
dark (L–D) cycles3,6. Therefore, we screened for an additional light 
sensor that functions in circadian photoentrainment using Drosophila 
activity monitors. We entrained flies under 12 h light–12 h dark (L–D) 
cycles for 4 days, and switched them to constant dark (D–D) condi­
tions. Control flies (w1118) displayed two daily activity peaks during 
dawn and dusk, termed the morning and evening peaks (Fig. 1a; note 
these are double plots). Activity increased before the light and dark 
transitions, indicating anticipation of changes in light, which is a hall­
mark of the circadian clock. Another such hallmark is the ability to 
maintain activity patterns established under L–D cycles after being 
transferred to constant darkness (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a, h).
Mutation of cry causes only subtle effects on circadian behaviour3 
(Extended Data Fig. 1b, h). Flies also show rhythmic behaviour after 
photoentrainment if they are missing the phospholipase C (PLC) 
NORPA2,5, which is required for phototransduction in the compound 
eye, or if they are doubly mutant for norpA and cry2,5 (Extended Data 
Fig. 1c, d, h). Phototransduction in Hofbauer–Buchner eyelet photo­
receptors couples to Rh6 and the TRPL channel7–9, but is independent 
of NORPA5. Flies triply mutant for rh5, rh6 and cry5, for norpA, cry and 
trp, or for norpA, trpl and cry are entrained by L–D cycles (Extended 
Data Fig. 1e–h). Thus, as proposed5, there is likely to be an additional 
light input pathway that influences the circadian clock preceding 
 
exposure to D–D.
The Drosophila genome encodes an uncharacterized opsin, Rh7 
(Extended Data Fig. 2a), which shares 27–30% amino acid identity 
with other opsins in Drosophila melanogaster. Rh7 is conserved in 
other Drosophila species (79–99% identity) and in Aedes aegypti and 
Anopheles gambiae (49–52% identity)10. Photoreceptor cells in the 
 
compound eye and ocelli express six opsins (Rh1–Rh6; Extended Data 
Fig. 2b, c). However, a mutation (gl60j) that eliminates ocular photo 
­
receptor cells and reduces levels of rh1 (also known as ninaE)–rh6 RNA 
did not reduce rh7 RNA levels (Fig. 1b). We performed RNA sequencing 
 
(RNA­seq) using RNA from flies expressing a cell death gene 
(GMR-hid) in ocular photoreceptor cells. The numbers of rh1–rh6 
 
transcripts were reduced markedly, whereas the number of rh7  
transcripts was unchanged (Fig. 1c). We did not detect Rh7 in the com­
pound eye with Rh7 antibodies (see below; Extended Data Fig. 2b–e). 
We generated an rh7 null allele, rh71 (Extended Data Fig. 2f, g), and 
tested the light responses of rh71 mutant flies by performing electro­
retinogram (ERG) recordings. The ERGs of control and rh71 flies were 
indistinguishable (Extended Data Fig. 2h–j). Thus, Rh7 neither was 
expressed nor functioned in known photoreceptor cells.
To address whether Rh7 is a light receptor, we tested whether it 
could substitute for Rh1 in R1–6 photoreceptor cells. Expression of rh7 
 
rescued a wild­type­like ERG in the rh1 mutant (ninaEI17; Extended 
Data Fig. 2k–m). To assess the light response due to Rh7 only, we 
 
eliminated the light responses from the remaining two photoreceptor 
cells (R7 and R8), which express other rhodopsins. Phototransduction 
was abolished in norpAP24 flies (Fig. 1d, e). We restored a photoresponse 
in R1–6 cells of norpAP24 flies by expressing a norpA+ transgene using 
the rh1 promoter (rh1> 
norpA; Fig. 1f). When we eliminated rh1 
(ninaEI17) from the norpAP24;rh1> 
norpA flies, the flies were unre­
sponsive to light (Fig. 1g). We restored a light response by expressing 
rh7 in the R1–6 cells (rh1> 
rh7; Fig. 1h). Thus, Rh7 is a light sensor and 
is capable of coupling to a Gq–PLC signalling pathway. We expressed 
Rh7 in HEK293T cells and found that it responded to light with a peak 
at 397 nm (Fig. 1i, j).
We raised Rh7 antibodies, which stained two groups of cells in the 
brain, consistent with a subset of central pacemaker neurons (Fig. 2a and 
Extended Data Fig. 3a, c). The approximately 150 pacemaker neurons 
 
express Period (Per), a core component of the circadian clock11–13, and 
are classified as dorsal and lateral neurons (Extended Data Fig. 3a). The 
15–16 lateral neurons include 5–6 dorsal lateral neurons (LNds), 4–5 
large ventrolateral neurons (l­LNvs), and 4–5 small ventrolateral neurons 
 
(s­LNvs)14. Rh7 and Per were co­expressed in the LNvs (Fig. 2a–c), 
which express the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF)15 
(Fig. 2d–f). We also detected Rh7­positive neurons in the vicinity 
of dorsal neurons 1 (DN1s) (Extended Data Fig. 3a, c), half of which 
expressed cry16 (Extended Data Fig. 3d, e). However, these neurons did 
not co­stain with the cry reporter (cry-Gal4.E13 (refs 2, 17); Extended 
Data Fig. 3e). We did not detect anti­Rh7 staining in other central pace­
maker neurons or in rh71 flies (Fig. 2g–i and Extended Data Fig. 3b).
Cry mediates rapid increases in action potentials evoked by blue light 
(450 nm peak) in l­LNvs18–20. We compared the electrophysiological

responsiveness to white (400–1,000 nm) and violet (405 nm) light in 
control and rh71 l­LNvs. The l­LNv responses to white and violet light 
were greatly diminished in cry01 and rh71 flies (Fig. 2j, k, m–o). Control, 
cry01 and rh71 flies showed minimal or no response to orange light 
(550–1,000 nm; Fig. 2l).
To address the importance of Rh7 to entrainment, we first investigated 
its contribution to circadian phase changes in response to a nighttime 
light pulse, which shifts the phase of the clock21. The direction of the 
shift depends on when the light is presented21–23. Lights were turned on 
and off at Zeitgeber time (ZT)0 and ZT12, respectively. An early night 
light pulse (ZT14–18) produced a phase delay in controls, whereas a 
late night light pulse (ZT20–22) caused a phase advance21 (Fig. 3a). 
As previously reported3,22, cry01 flies displayed severely impaired phase 
shifting to early or late night pulses (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4).
We exposed rh71 flies to nighttime light pulses. The phase delay was 
normal if the stimulus was presented early (ZT14; Fig. 3a and Extended 
Data Fig. 4). However if the light pulse occurred later, the degree of 
phase shift was significantly reduced (ZT16, P < 0.01; ZT18, P < 0.01; 
ZT20, P < 0.01; ZT22, P < 0.01; Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4). We 
knocked down rh7 RNA in wild­type flies using an LNv­specific driver 
(pdf–Gal4) (Extended Data Fig. 3f–i) and then exposed the flies to light 
at ZT22. These flies exhibited the same phase advance defect as rh71 
flies (Fig. 3b), indicating that Rh7 is required in PDF­positive neurons 
for normal photoentrainment.
Phase advances due to light pulses late at night (ZT22) correlate with 
light­induced degradation of the core clock protein Timeless (Tim)24. 
Tim degradation depends on binding to Cry24, or results from neu­
ronal activation25. As light­induced neuronal firing is reduced in rh71 
flies, light­induced degradation of Tim might be impaired. To test this 
hypothesis, we applied a light pulse at ZT22 and assayed anti­Tim sig­
nals in PDF neurons (LNvs) 55 min later. In controls, light caused a 
4.8­fold decline in Tim (Fig. 3c, f). However, in rh71 LNvs, light caused 
only a slight reduction in anti­Tim staining, which was not statistically 
significant (Fig. 3d, f). We rescued this defect with a genomic transgene 
(Fig. 3e, f).
Another test of photoentrainment is to assess the number of days 
required to adjust to a delay in the light­to­dark transition. If control 
flies are entrained under L–D cycles, and then the transition from 
light to darkness is delayed by 8 h, they quickly re­entrain to the new 
L–D cycle1 (Fig. 3g, h). The evening peak shifts by 7.6 ± 
 0.1 h on day 
1 and 7.9 ± 0.1 h on day 2 (Fig. 3g). Consistent with a previous study1, 
cry01 flies shifted by only 4.6 ± 
 0.2 h on day 1 and 6.5 ± 
 0.1 h on day 2, 
 
and required 3 days to establish stable peak activity (Fig. 3g, i). We

found that rh71 flies displayed significant delays in phase shift 
 
(day 1, 6.5 ± 0.2 h, P < 0.01; day 2, 7.1 ± 0.1 h, P < 0.01; Fig. 3g, j) con­
sistent with a contribution of Rh7 to photoentrainment. We rescued 
the defect with an rh7+ genomic transgene (Fig. 3g, k). The impairment 
in the phase­shift exhibited by rh71 cry01 double mutant flies (day 1, 
3.1 ± 
 0.2 h; day 2, 5.3 ± 
 0.2 h) was more severe than those seen in the 
single mutants (Fig. 3g, l).
Constant light (L–L) leads to arrhythmic circadian behaviour in 
 
wild­type flies6 (Fig. 4a, d). However, cry mutant flies remain rhythmic 
in constant light6 (93.1%; Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Under L–L 
conditions, 19.0% of rh71 flies are also rhythmic, and this phenotype 
 
is rescued by a wild­type rh7+ transgene (Fig. 4b–d and Extended 
 
Data Fig. 5b).
Because phototransduction promotes signal amplification and 
 
sensitivity to low light, we tested the effects of lack of Rh7 on 
 
rhythmicity by photoentraining rh71 flies and then exposing them 
to constant dim light (10 lx). Few control flies maintained rhyth­
micity even under dim light, whereas all cry01 flies were rhythmic 
 
(Fig. 4e, h and Extended Data Fig. 5c). Notably, the majority of 
rh71 flies maintained rhythmicity under constant dim light (66.7%; 
 
Fig. 4f–h). We restored wild­type responses with an rh7+ genomic 
transgene (Extended Data Fig. 5d). These data suggest that Rh7 is 
required for sensitizing the Cry­dependent circadian photoresponse 
under dim light conditions.
PDF­expressing LNvs promote light­dependent arousal26,27. 
To test whether Rh7 functions in arousal, we stimulated the flies 
at night (ZT22) with a 5­min white light pulse. The rh71 flies 
 
displayed decreased light­coincident arousal (Fig. 4i and Extended Data 
 
Fig. 5e) and a longer arousal delay than control flies (Extended Data 
Fig. 5f), and these defects were at least as great as those exhibited by 
cry01 flies20 (Fig. 4i and Extended Data Fig. 5e, f). Responses to red 
light were not impaired significantly in the mutant flies (Extended Data 
Fig. 5g). The rh71 cry01 double mutant, but not the single mutants, 
exhibited a deficit in violet light arousal (405 nm; Extended Data 
 
Fig. 5h), indicating that the two light sensors compensate for each other 
during the arousal response.
We tested for a potential role of Rh7 in maintaining rhythmic behav­
iour during constant darkness (D–D) following L–D entrainment. The 
mutant flies showed rhythmic diurnal and circadian behaviour similar 
to that of wild­type flies (Fig. 4j, k, p). As previously shown1, cryb flies 
also photoentrained and exhibited rhythmic diurnal and circadian 
behaviour (Fig. 4l, p). However, rh71 cryb double mutant flies showed 
profound deficits. Over one­third (37.2%) of the animals were arrhyth­
mic (Fig. 4m, p), possibly owing to insufficient synchronization of the 
molecular clock between different groups of central pacemaker neurons 
in the absence of both light sensors intrinsic to these cells. The remain­
ing rhythmic flies displayed much longer periodicity during D–D than 
did controls (control, 23.8 ± 
 0.08 h; rh71 cryb, 27.3 ± 
 0.07 h, P < 
 0.01; 
Fig. 4j, n). rh71 cry01 double mutants displayed similar impairments 
(Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). Thus, at least one of the two light receptors 
is required in pacemaker neurons for normal rhythmic behaviour. We 
rescued these defects with an rh7+ genomic transgene (Fig. 4o, p).
Although flies with single gl60j, rh71 or cry mutations display photo­
entrainment impairments1, they are capable of circadian rhythmicity. 
Thus, any two of these three photoreceptors (Cry, Rh7 and gl­dependent) 
 
are sufficient for rhythmic circadian behaviour. However, Rh7 is insuf­
ficient on its own because gl60j cryb flies are circadian blind1. To test 
whether cry alone is sufficient for rhythmic behaviour, we subjected 
the rh71 gl60j double mutant flies to a L–D regime followed by D–D, 
and found that 25% were arrhythmic (Extended Data Fig. 6d–h). Thus, 
although Cry alone cannot preserve fully wild­type circadian behav­
iour, it enables flies to maintain greater rhythmicity than just Rh7 or 
gl­dependent photoreceptor cells. We exposed rh71 gl60j flies to a 5­min 
light pulse at ZT22 to test their circadian phase­response. Although 
rh71 and gl60j single mutants showed a decreased phase­advance, 
rh71 gl60j double mutant flies displayed a greater impairment (Extended

Data Fig. 6i). As cry01 flies also showed defects in the phase­response 
to a 5­min pulse (Fig. 3a), multiple light­input pathways contribute to 
circadian light sensation.
To test whether rh7 functions in LNvs neurons, we performed rescue 
experiments. Expression of rh7 (UAS–rh7) using either the tim–GAL4 
driver or the pdf–GAL4 driver rescued the increase in arrhythmicity 
exhibited by rh71 cryb flies (Extended Data Fig. 7). Introduction of other 
rhodopsins into PDF­positive neurons also restored normal rhyth­
micity (Extended Data Fig. 8), further supporting a rhodopsin­based 
mechanism for circadian function in LNvs.
In s­LNvs and l­LNvs, Per protein peaks during dawn (ZT22–ZT2) 
and enters a trough28 (Extended Data Fig. 9a–c). In rh71 flies, Per also 
displayed oscillations in LNvs (Extended Data Fig. 9d–f), consistent 
with their rhythmic behaviour under L–D cycles. Per oscillations in 
LNvs are altered in cryb mutants1,3. The trough and peak are delayed 
in s­LNVs, and there is a large reduction in oscillation amplitude in 
l­LNVs (Extended Data Fig. 9g–i). In rh71 cryb flies, Per levels remained 
high from ZT2 to ZT14 in s­LNvs and peaked shortly after dusk (ZT14) 
in l­LNvs (Extended Data Fig. 9j–l). PDF does not oscillate in control29 
or rh71 LNvs (Extended Data Fig. 9a, d).
In the eye, rhodopsins signal through the PLC encoded by norpA. 
However, norpA and cry double mutant flies exhibit normal rhythmicity 
 
during constant darkness following L–D entrainment2,5 (Extended 
Data Fig. 1d, h), indicating that Rh7 signalling in LNvs is NORPA­
independent. To investigate whether the other PLCβ 
 (PLC21C) 
 
functions in PDF neurons, we combined two UAS–plc21C RNAi lines 
with the pdf–Gal4 driver (Extended Data Fig. 10a), and then exposed 
the flies to a white­light pulse for 5 min at ZT22. Knockdown of plc21C 
caused reductions in phase­advance at ZT22 (Extended Data Fig. 10b–g), 
 
similar to the effects of the rh71 mutation (Fig. 3a).
In summary, our work establishes a role for a rhodopsin in the 
 
central brain. Rh7 is strategically expressed in PDF­positive cells, which 
appear to be master light input clock neurons that also receive input 
from the optical lobes26. The fact that PDF­positive neurons express 
two distinct light sensors (Rh7 and Cry) highlights their key role in 
 
circadian photoentrainment. In the mammalian retina, around 1% 
of retinal ganglion cells are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs), 
and these cells function in circadian photoentrainment. ipRGCs are 
directly light sensitive owing to the expression of melanopsin and also 
receive light information from rods and cones. The striking similar­
ities between Drosophila PDF­positive neurons and ipRGCs indicate 
a common strategy for circadian photoentrainment. Opsins are also 
expressed in the mammalian brain30, although their functions are 
unknown. Because light penetrates the mammalian skull, our findings 
raise the possibility that neurons in the mammalian brain also sense 
light and contribute to photoentrainment of circadian rhythms.

MethOdS
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. All behaviour data 
were collected in a random manner. No blinding method was used in assessing 
experimental outcomes.
Fly stocks. The following flies were obtained from Bloomington Stock Center: 
isogenized w1118 (BL5905), norpAP24 (BL9048), ninaE­norpA (rh1> 
norpA; this is a 
direct fusion of the ninaE promoter to the norpA coding region; BL52276), ninaE–
Gal4 (rh1–Gal4; BL8691), trpMB (BL23636), trplMB (BL29314), UAS–mcherry- 
NLS (BL38425), gl60j (BL 509), pdf–Gal4 (BL6900), and two UAS–plc21C RNAi 
lines (01210, BL 31269 and 01211, BL31270). GMR–hid31 was obtained from 
the Drosophila Genetic Resource Center, Kyoto (108419). We used w1118 as the 
control strain. The UAS–rh7 RNAi line (v1478) was from VDRC Stock Center. 
The tim–Gal4 transgene32 was provided by A. Sehgal. The cry–Gal4.E13 trans­
gene2 was from M. Rosbash. The cryb and cry01 flies2,33 were provided by M. Wu 
and the rh502, rh601, UAS-rh3, UAS-rh4 and UAS-rh5 lines34,35 were provided by 
 
C. Desplan. We also used ninaEI17 flies36.
Cloning of the rh7 cDNA and generation of transgenic flies. To clone 
the rh7 coding region, we prepared mRNA from w1118 heads, performed 
reverse transcription (RT)­PCR using the following primers, and cloned 
the cDNA into the TOPO vector (pCR2.1­TOPO, Invitrogen). Primers: rh7  
forward, GCGGCCGCCACCATGGAGGCCATCATCATGACG; rh7 reverse, 
GCGGCCGCTCAGAACTTACTCTGTTCCATGAC. To generate the UAS–rh7 
 
transgene, we subcloned the rh7 open reading frame into the NotI site of the 
pUAST vector. To construct the plasmid for expression of Rh7 in HEK293T 
cells, we subcloned the rh7 open reading frame between the BamH1 and 
Xba1 sites of the pCS2+ 
MT vector using the following primers: rh7 for­
ward, ATCAGATCTCACCATGGAGGCCATCATCATGACG; rh7 reverse, 
ATCTCTAGATCAGAACTTACTCTGTTCCATGAC.
To generate transgenic flies expressing an Rh7–FLAG fusion protein, we first 
constructed the pUAST–FLAG vector using the following two oligonucleotides, 
which we annealed and cloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites of the pUAST vec­
tor: FLAG 5′ 
­XbaI, TCGAGGGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGTAAT 
and FLAG 3′ 
­XhoI, CTAGATTACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCCC. 
We amplified the rh7 coding region using the same forward primer as above, in 
conjunction with the following reverse primer to eliminate the stop codon: rh7 
reverseno­stop, GCGGCCGCGAACTTACTCTGTTCCATGAC. Both the UAS–rh7 
and UAS–rh7–FLAG transgenic flies were obtained by germline transformation 
using w1118 embryos (Bestgene Inc.).
To generate flies expressing an rh7+ genomic transgene (P[rh7+]), a BAC 
genomic DNA clone (CH322180G19) was obtained from the P[acman] collec­
tion37. The germline transformation took advantage of site­specific integration 
using the Φ 
31­attB/attP system (Bestgene Inc.).
Generation of rh71 mutant flies by homologous recombination. We pro­
duced the plasmid for knocking out rh7 by ends­out homologous recom­
bination38 as follows. We PCR amplified two homologous arms (left, 3.2 kb 
 
and right, 3.3 kb) using the following primers: left arm forward, AATTGCTGGGA 
TCCCTCAATTGGCCTAATCGGTTTCTG; left arm reverse, AATTGCTGGGTA 
CCGACTGACTTGGCCAAATATTTACG; right arm forward, AATGCTGGCGG 
CCGCTTAAAATGCTGCCCGAGACT; right arm reverse, AATTGCTGGCGG 
CCGCTGGCTTATGAAGTTGCAAAAAG. We cloned the two arms into the tar­
geting vector, pw35loxp–Gal4. This construct was designed to delete 540 base pairs 
(bp) 3′ 
 to the rh7 translational start site, and was replaced with a cassette containing 
the mini­white marker and Gal4 flanked by two loxP sites. The upstream loxP 
sequence contained a translational start site that rendered the Gal4 coding region 
out of frame. Consequently, the Gal4 was not functional. To obtain the donor lines 
for generating the rh7 knockout (rh71 allele), the targeting vector was injected 
into w1118 embryos (Bestgene Inc.). We mobilized the donor insertion by crossing 
the donor line to y,w;P[70FLP]11 P[70I-SceI]2B nocSco/CyO flies (Bloomington 
Stock Center, BL6934). The progeny were screened for gene targeting in the rh7 
locus by PCR using two pairs of primers. The first pair (P1 and P2) were the fol­
lowing two primers that annealed to the first and second coding exons, and pro­
duced a DNA product (885 bp) only in the wild­type (Extended Data Fig. 2g): P1, 
CTCTCGCTCTCCGAGATGTT and P2, ACCACCGAAATCAGGCAATA. The 
following second pair of primers (P3 and P4) annealed to the mini­white gene and 
to a sequence 3′ to rh7, and therefore only generated a product in the rh71 mutant 
(4.4 kb; Extended Data Fig. 2g): P3, TGTACATAAAAGCGAACCGAACCT and 
P4, ACTGTGCGACAGAGTGAGAGAGCAATAGTA. After generating rh71, we 
outcrossed the flies to the control stain (w1118) for five generations.
Genotyping timeless, jetlag and period alleles. To determine whether the key 
fly lines used in this study harboured the perSLIH, timls or jetc mutations in the 
genetic background, we performed DNA sequencing. We extracted genomic 
DNA from adult flies, and amplified the relevant regions in the per, tim and 
jet genes by PCR (Phusion High­Fidelity DNA Polymerase, NEB) using the 
following primers: per: forward, GTCCACACACAACACCAAGG; reverse, 
TTGATGATCATGTCGCTGCT. tim: forward, TGGCTGGGGATTGAAAATAA; 
reverse, TTACAGATACCGCGCAAATG. jet: forward, AGCCGATCATAGTGG 
AGTGC; reverse, AAGGCACGCACAGGTTTACT.
We purified the PCR products and subjected them to DNA sequencing (DNA 
Sequencing Facility at the University of California, Berkeley). The perSLIH allele 
has a C to A transversion at nucleotide 2688438. The control (per+) sequence 
encompassing this region (2688436–2688448, Drosophila genome release r6.14) 
is CTCCGGCAGCAGT. The perSLIH sequence is CTACGGCAGCAGT. All of the 
fly lines checked had sequences that matched per+. These include: (1) rh71, (2) 
rh71 cryb, (3) rh71 cry01, (4) pdf–Gal4 and (5) rh7-RNAi. The timls allele has a single 
nucleotide insertion (C) after nucleotide 3504474 relative to tims. The sequence 
spanning this region in the control (timls) is ATCAAAGTTCTGAT (3504473–
3504486, Drosophila genome release r6.14) and in tims is ATAAAGTTCTGAT. We 
sequenced the following lines, all which had sequences that matched the control 
(tims): (1) cry01, (2) rh71 and (3) P[rh7+]; rh71. The jetc allele has a T­to­A trans­
version at nucleotide 4949048. The control (jet+) sequence spanning this region 
(4949059–4949047, Drosophila genome release r6.14) is CTTGATTATCTTC, 
while the jetc sequence is CTTGATTATCTAC. We sequenced the following lines, 
all of which had sequences that matched the control (jet+): (1) cry01, (2) rh71 and 
(3) P[rh7+];rh71.
Quantitative RT–PCR and RNA-seq data for opsins. To quantify expression of 
opsin genes (Fig. 1b), we isolated total RNA from ~ 
50 fly heads from each of the 
indicated fly stocks, and used 1 μ 
g total RNA from each sample as a template for 
reverse transcription using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher, 
cat. 18080093). Oligo dT primers were used for cDNA synthesis. cDNA prepara­
tion was subjected to real­time quantitative PCR (Roche, LightCycler 480 system) 
according to the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green 1 Master Mix (cat. 04707516001) 
protocol. The primers used for real­time quantitative PCR were: rh1: forward 
CGCTACCAAGTGATCGTCAA, reverse GTATGAGCGTGGGTTCCAGT. rh2: 
forward TCCGTGCTGGACAATGTG, reverse AATCATGCACATGGACCAGA. 
rh3: forward CGAGCAAAAGAACAGGAAGC, reverse TCGATACGCGA 
CTCTTTGTG. rh4: forward GTAGCCCTCTGGCACGAAT, reverse TCTTCAG 
CACATCCAAGTCG. rh5: forward TCCTGACCACCTGCTCCTTC, reverse 
GCTCCAGCTCCAGACGATAC. rh6: forward CAAGGACTGGTGGAACAGGT, 
reverse GTACTTCGGGTGGCTCAATC. rh7: forward GTTTCCACGGGTC 
TGACAAT, reverse GCTGTAGCACCAGATCAGCA. rp49: forward GACG 
CTTCAAGGGACAGTATCTG, reverse AAACGCGGTTCTGCATGAG.
We also analysed opsin gene expression using an RNA­seq dataset (Fig. 1c). 
For each genotype, three independent RNA libraries were prepared from ~ 
50 
heads using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit. Pair­end sequencing was 
performed using the TruSeq platform (Illumina). Details of the RNA­seq exper­
iments and data analysis will be presented elsewhere (J.D.N., I. Tekin and C.M., 
in preparation). Opsin RNA­seq mRNA levels were quantified as RPKM. RPKMs 
for each opsin were calculated independently and the average RPKMs are plotted.
Quantitative RT–PCR following plc21C RNAi knockdown. To knock­down 
plc21C expression, we combined each UAS–plc21C RNAi transgene (01210 
and 01211) with UAS–Dicer2;;actin–Gal4. To quantify the efficacy of the RNAi, 
we extracted total RNA from ten adult flies (five male and five female), and 
used 1 μ 
g total RNA from each sample as a template for reverse transcription 
using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher, cat. 18080093). 
Oligo dT primers were used for cDNA synthesis. cDNA preparation was sub­
jected to quantitative PCR (Roche, LightCycler 480 system) according to the 
 
LightCycler 480 SYBR Green 1 Master Mix (cat. 04707516001) protocol. The 
 
plc21C primers used were: forward, GGATCTCTCCAAGTCGTTCG; reverse, TAG 
CCGCTTCACCAGCTTAT. The rp49 primers were: forward, GACGCTTC 
AAGGGACAGTATCTG; reverse, AAACGCGGTTCTGCATGAG. In each reaction, 
 
we normalized expression of plc21C transcripts to rp49.
Generation of Rh7 antibodies. To obtain Rh7 antibodies, we generated a GST–Rh7 
 
fusion protein by subcloning the region encoding the N­terminal 80 amino 
acids into the pGEX6P­1 vector (GE Healthcare Life Science). We expressed the 
fusion protein in Escherichia coli (BL21), purified the recombinant protein using 
 
glutathione sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Life Science) and generated antiserum 
 
in a rabbit (Covance). We affinity purified the antibodies by conjugating the antigen 
 
to Affi­Gel 10 (Bio­Rad).
Immunohistochemistry on whole mounts of Drosophila brains. We performed 
immunohistochemistry using whole­mounted fly brains as described previously39. 
Briefly, we fixed dissected brains for 15–20 min at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in 
phosphate buffer (0.1 M Na3PO4, pH 7.4) with 0.3% Triton­X100 (Sigma), hereafter 
referred to as PBT. The brains were blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Sigma) 
in phosphate buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. We then incubated the tissue with primary

overnight at 4 °C with the following secondary antibodies from Life Technologies: 
anti­mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 Dyes, anti­rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 Dyes 
or Alexa dyes. The brains were washed three times with PBT and mounted in 
VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Labs) for imaging. For Rh7 and PDF 
co­staining (Fig. 2d–i), four brains were examined.
Immunohistochemistry for circadian clock proteins (Tim and Per). To analyse 
light­mediated degradation of Tim (Fig. 3c–f), we entrained the flies for 3 days 
under 12 h light–12 h dark cycles (~ 
600 lx LED white light). The flies were then 
exposed to a 5­min LED light stimulation (~ 
600 lx) at ZT22, kept in the dark 
for 55 min, fixed at ZT23 under a red photographic safety light (for 45 min), and 
dissected for whole­mount immunostaining. Flies that were not exposed to the 
nocturnal light treatment were fixed and stained at the same time.
To examine Per staining at different ZT points (Extended Data Fig. 9), flies 
were entrained for 4 days under 12 h light (~ 
400 lx)–12 h dark cycles, and were 
collected at the indicated ZTs. For nighttime samples, we handled the flies under 
a red photographic safety light. We prefixed whole flies at 4 °C with 4% paraform­
aldehyde in PBT for 45 min before dissecting out the brains. After the dissections, 
the brains were fixed again for 15–20 min at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBT.
We used the following primary antibodies: anti­Rh7 (1:250, rabbit), anti­Per 
(1:1,000, guinea pig), anti­Tim (1:1,000, rat)40, anti­PDF (1:1,000, c7 mouse mon­
oclonal antibody from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), anti­dsRed 
(1:500, mouse, Clontech Catalog #632392). The Per and Tim antibodies were con­
tributed by A. Sehgal. The secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were 
anti­rat Alexa Fluor 568 Dye and anti­guinea pig Alexa Fluor 555 Dye. We acquired 
the images using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope.
Immunostaining of whole-mounts of the Drosophila retina. To perform whole­
mount staining of the retina, we dissected the retina (within the eye cup) and fixed 
the tissue at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBT for 20 min. After washing briefly 
in PBT, we blocked the retina for 1 h in PBT plus with 5% normal goat serum. We 
used the following primary antibodies: anti­Rh7 (1:250, rabbit), anti­Rh3 (1:200, 
mouse, gift from S. Britt, University of Colorado, Denver) and anti­Rh5 (1:200, 
mouse, gift from S. Britt, University of Colorado, Denver). The secondary anti­
bodies were: anti­rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 Dye (1:1000) and anti­mouse Alexa Fluor 
488 Dye (1:1000).
Circadian behaviour to assess rhythmicity and periodicity. Circadian experi­
ments were performed at 25 °C using the Drosophila Activity Monitoring (DAM) 
System (Trikinetics). Individual 3–7­day­old male flies were loaded into moni­
toring tubes, which contained 1% agarose (Invitrogen) and 5% sucrose (Sigma) as 
the food source. The flies were entrained to 12 h light–12 h dark cycles for 4 days 
and released to constant darkness or constant light (10 lx for dim light conditions 
and 400 lx for bright light conditions, unless indicated otherwise) for at least six 
days to measure periodicity.
Data collection and analyses were performed using Clocklab (Actimetrics). 
Activity data for each fly were binned every 30 min for the circadian analyses. To 
obtain the periodicities, data from constant darkness were subjected to χ 
2 peri­
odograms and fast Fourier transfer analysis using Clocklab software. The rhythm 
strength of a fly was measured as the power minus the significance (p − 
 s). Flies 
were considered arrhythmic based on either p − s < 10 or FFT < 0.03. Actograms 
of weakly rhythmic flies were visually inspected to confirm rhythmicity.
Circadian behaviour to assess light-mediated phase shift and phase delay. To 
investigate the effects on activity of 5­min light pulses at night (Fig. 3a, b; Extended 
Data Figs 4, 10), we first entrained the flies for 3 days under 12 h light–12 h dark 
cycles (~ 
600 lx LED white light). During the night of the fourth L–D cycle 
 
(at ZT14, ZT16, ZT18, ZT20 or ZT22), we exposed the flies to a single 5­min light 
pulse (LED white light, ~ 
600 lx), and then maintained the flies under constant 
darkness. The phase shift was calculated as the phase difference of the evening 
peaks before and after the light pulse. Negative and positive phase changes indicate 
phase delays and phase advances, respectively.
To conduct the phase delay experiments (Fig. 3g–l), we first entrained the flies 
for 4 days under 12 h light–12 h dark cycles (~ 
400 lx LED white light). To obtain a 
phase delay of 8 h, on day 5 we extended the light phase to 20 h, and then returned 
the flies to normal 12 h dark–12 h light cycles. The phase shift magnitude was 
calculated as the phase difference between the evening peak of the day before the 
phase shift and the indicated day after the phase shift.
Circadian behaviour to assess light-mediated arousal. To assess light­dependent 
arousal, we entrained the flies for 4 days under 12 h light–12 h dark cycles and 
then exposed the flies to a 5­min white light pulse (~ 
600 lx LED lights) at ZT22. 
We binned the activity data for each fly every minute. ‘Light­coincident arousal’ 
is the increase in locomotion activity (bin­crosses) during the 5­min stimulation 
compared to the previous 5 min. ‘
Arousal delay’ is the time between lights on and 
maximum activity.
Cell transfection, membrane extraction and spectral photometry. The 
HEK293T cells were obtained from the ATCC, which authenticates their lines. 
This line has not been tested for mycoplasma contamination. The HEK293T cells 
were cultured to 70% confluency and transfected with 2 μ 
g pCS2+ 
MT­rh7 plasmid 
 
per 10­cm dish. We used the FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Cat.E2311) to 
perform the transfections. Cells were harvested 24–36 h after transfection and 
stored at − 
80 °C. For reconstitution of Rh7 with the chromophore, the HEK293T 
cells were resuspended in cold PBS (pH 7.4, Quality Biological Inc.) supplemented 
with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma P8340) and incubated with 40 μ 
M 11­cis­ 
retinal in the dark for 4 h. We prepared membrane protein extracts by resuspending 
membrane pellets in 0.1% CHAPs in PBS, rotating for 2 h at 4 °C, then centrifuging 
(14,000g) for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed and analysed with a 
UV3600 UV­Nir­NIR Spectrometer (Shimadzu). To obtain the spectral absorption 
for Rh7, we used membrane extracts from untransfected cells as the blank.
ERG recordings. ERG recordings were performed by filling two glass electrodes 
with Drosophila Ringer’s solution (3 mM CaCl2, 182 mM KCl, 46 mM NaCl, 10 mM 
Tris pH 7.2) and placing small droplets of electrode cream on the surface of the 
compound eye and the thorax to increase conductance. We inserted the recording 
electrode into the cream on the surface of the compound eye and the reference 
electrode into the cream on the thorax. Flies were dark adapted for 1 min before 
stimulating with a 2­s pulse using a halogen light (~ 
30 mV/cm2 unless indicated 
otherwise). The ERG signals were amplified with a Warner electrometer and 
recorded with a Powerlab 4/30 analogue­to­digital converter (AD Instruments). 
Data were collected and analysed with the Laboratory Chart version 6.1 program 
(AD Instruments).
Patch-clamp recordings. Patch­clamp measurements were performed on 
acutely dissected adult fly brains as described previously18,19. Briefly, all 
patch­clamp recordings were performed during the daytime to avoid clock­ 
dependent variance in firing rate. All l­LNvs were recorded within a relatively 
narrow daytime window, and recordings for each genotype were normally distrib­
uted for the time of day and did not vary significantly among all three genotypes. 
l­LNv recordings were made in whole­cell current clamp mode. After allowing the 
membrane properties to stabilize after whole cell break­in, we recorded for 30–60 s 
in the current clamp configuration (unless otherwise stated) under nearly dark 
conditions (~ 
0.05 mW/cm2) before the lights were turned on. Lights­on data were 
collected for 5–20 s and this was followed by 60–120 s of darkness.
Multiple light sources were used for these studies. We used a standard halogen 
light source on an Olympus BX51 WI microscope (Olympus USA) for all experi­
ments with white light (400–1,000 nm, 4 mW/cm2). Orange light (550–1,000 nm; 
4 mW/cm2) for electrophysiological recordings was achieved by placing appro­
priate combinations of 25 mm long­ and short­pass filters (Edmund Industrial 
Optics) over the halogen light source directly beneath the recording chamber. 
We changed the filters during the recordings to internally match the neuronal 
responses to different wavelengths of light. Recordings using 405 nm violet light 
(0.8 mW/cm2) were obtained using LEDs obtained from Prizmatix 405 LED (UHP­
Mic­LED­405), which provide > 
2 W collimated purple light (405 nm peak, 15 nm 
spectrum half width). Light was measured for all sources using a Newport 818­UV 
sensor and the Optical Power/Energy Meter (842­PE, Newport Corporation) and 
expressed as mW/cm2.
The control genotype for the electrophysiological recordings was w;pdf-Gal4-
dORK-NC1-GFP. The cry01 and rh71 recordings were performed using w;pdf-Gal4-
dORK-NC1-GFP;cry01 and w;pdf-Gal4-dORK-NC1-GFP; rh71, respectively.
Statistical analyses. To analyse two sets of data, we used the unpaired Student’s 
t­test. To compare multiple sets of behavioural data, we used a one­away ANOVA 
(Kruskal–Wallis test) followed by Dunn’s test. Data are presented as mean ± 
 s.e.m. 
We used Fisher’s exact test to analyse the percentages of rhythmic flies. For the 
patch­clamp recordings, the data are presented as mean ± 
 s.e.m. Values of n refer to 
the number of measured light on–off cycles. In all cases the n values were obtained 
from at least 5 separate recordings (see legends). ANOVAs were performed using 
SigmaPlot 11 (Systat Software Inc.) or Prism 6 (Graphpad Software). The data 
were first tested for normal distribution. If the data were not normally distributed, 
we performed Kruskal–Wallis one way analysis of variance on ranks, followed by 
Dunn’s test. ANOVAs on normally distributed data were followed by Tukey’s test 
to determine significant differences between genotypes.
