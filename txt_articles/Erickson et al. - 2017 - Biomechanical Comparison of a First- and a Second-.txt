Background: All–soft tissue suture anchors provide advantages of decreased removal of bone and decreased glenoid volume
occupied compared with traditional tap or screw-in suture anchors. Previous published data have led to biomechanical concerns
with the use of first-generation all-soft suture anchors.
Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the load to 2-mm displacement and ultimate load to failure of a
second-generation all-soft suture anchor, compared with a first-generation anchor and a traditional PEEK (polyether ether ketone)
anchor. The null hypothesis was that the newer second-generation anchor will demonstrate no difference in loads to 2-mm dis-
placement after cycling compared with first-generation all-soft suture anchors.
Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
Methods: Twenty human cadaveric glenoids were utilized to create 97 total suture anchor sites, and 1 of 3 anchors were ran-
domized and placed into each site: (1) first-generation all-soft suture anchor (Juggerknot; Biomet), (2) second-generation all-soft
suture anchor (Suturefix; Smith & Nephew), and (3) a control PEEK anchor (Bioraptor; Smith & Nephew). After initial cyclic loading,
load to 2 mm of displacement and ultimate load to failure were measured for each anchor.
Results: After cyclic loading, the load to 2-mm displacement was significantly less in first-generation anchors compared with controls
(P < .01). However, the load to 2-mm displacement was significantly greater in second-generation anchors compared with controls
(P < .01). There was no difference in ultimate load to failure between the first- and second-generation all-soft suture anchors (P > .05).
Conclusion: The newer generation all-soft suture anchors with a theoretically more rigid construct and deployment configuration
demonstrate biomechanical characteristics (specifically, with load to 2-mm displacement after cyclic loading) that are improved
over first-generation all-soft suture anchors and similar to a traditional solid tap-in anchor. The configuration of these newer
generation all-soft suture anchors appears to mitigate the biomechanical concerns of decreased load to failure with first-generation
all–soft tissue suture anchors.
Clinical Relevance: The theoretical advantages of all-soft anchors may be particularly valuable in revision surgery or in cases
where multiple anchors are being placed into a small anatomic area.

 removal of lower volume of glenoid bone stock during
placement of this anchor and less volume of bone occu-
pied by the anchor.12,20 This may be particularly helpful
in revision situations or when a large number of anchors
need to be placed, such as in panlabral repairs.1,9 The
first generation of these suture anchors, such as the Bio-
met Juggerknot, the Arthrex FiberTak, the Linvatec
Y-knot, and the Stryker Iconix, all obtain fixation via a
simple insertion device that requires the sutures to be
pulled back to the cortical bone for deployment to
increase their surface area and increase the required
force for pullout. Recent data suggest that some first-
generation all-soft suture anchors, namely the Biomet
Juggerknot, may have inferior biomechanical properties
in terms of submaximal displacement after cyclic loading
compared with all-solid anchors,20,26 causing concern
about the utilization of this new technology despite the
potential advantages.
Second-generation anchors have reconfigured deploy-
ment mechanisms that may help mitigate these biome-
chanical concerns. These anchors, such as the Smith &
Nephew Suturefix, the Smith & Nephew Q-fix, and the
Cayenne Medical Surelock, use insertion devices that do
not require manual tensioning for deployment of the
anchor, which theoretically should reduce partial deploy-
ments or accidental anchor pullout from overtensioning.
There is tactile feedback in the form of a “click” so the user
is sure that the anchor has deployed, and the deployment
mechanism utilizes the steel inserter, not the bone itself, to
form the appropriate anchor conformation in this second-
generation model. It may decrease micromotion from
increased cavity size created by setting the first-
generation anchors.26
Our purpose in this study was to evaluate the biome-
chanics of a first-generation all-soft suture anchor (Biomet
Juggerknot) along with a newer second-generation model
(Smith & Nephew Suturefix) compared with a traditional
tap-in solid anchor control (Smith & Nephew Bioraptor) in
a human cadaveric model. Our null hypothesis was that the
newer second-generation all-soft suture anchor will demon-
strate no difference in loads to 2-mm displacement after
cyclic loading compared with first-generation all-soft
suture anchors.
METHODS
Specimens
Cadaveric specimens were purchased through the Surgical
Research Laboratory of our institution. Ten matched-pair
cadaveric shoulders (20 specimens total) were thawed, and
all soft tissue attachments, including capsule and labrum,
were carefully removed. Demographic data for the speci-
mens are presented in Table 1. Bone density of the
matched-pair humeri was established in a prior study17
by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and was used in this
study to approximate the bone density of the matched glen-
oid specimen. The specimens were cut approximately 2.25
inches medial to the glenoid. Two 2-inch drywall screws
were inserted into the medial border of the cut scapular
specimen. The specimens were then potted in bone cement.
After potting, the specimens were re-stored at �20�C. Prior
to anchor insertion and testing, the specimens were thawed
overnight at room temperature.
Anchor Application
The anchors tested were the Biomet Juggerknot 1.4 mm as
a first-generation all-soft suture anchor, the Smith &
Nephew Suturefix Ultra S 1.7 mm as a second-
generation all-soft suture anchor, and the Smith &
Nephew Bioraptor 2.3 PK for an all-solid control polyether
ether ketone (PEEK) anchor (Figure 1). These are all
anchors designed for use in the glenoid of the shoulder.
The potted specimens were placed in a custom adjustable
fixation device that was fixed to an Instron universal test-
ing machine (model 4202). Using a goniometer, anchors
were inserted at a 45� angle to the glenoid face as previ-
ously described.20 Using the assistance of a biostatistician,
a randomized pattern for anchor insertion was created.
Approximately 1000 randomized patterns were created
and then were assessed to ensure they would provide a
normal distribution of anchors across each of the 20 speci-
mens, until 1 randomization pattern was chosen. Anchors
were inserted at the 12:00, 2:30, 4:30, 6:00, 8:30, and 10:30
positions in all glenoids. This clock-face pattern was stan-
dardized, with 12:00 being the superior-most point on the
glenoid rim and 2:30 always being in the direction of the
tip of the coracoid, regardless of the side of the individual
specimen.
Out of a total of 120 possible sites (6 anchors per speci-
men � 20 specimens), 97 were ultimately included for anal-
ysis. A site was excluded if it was already occupied by

 anchors that were placed for surgical procedures prior to
the patient’s death (n ¼ 17), there was a pre-existing glen-
oid fracture (n ¼ 2), or there was site damage during inser-
tion (n ¼ 4). All anchors were inserted per the
manufacturer’s suggested technique.
Biomechanical Testing Protocol
Biomechanical testing was performed using the Instron
materials testing system, and the testing protocol was
similar to that previously used and published.7,13 All
anchors were tested with a direct line of pull to simu-
late the worst-case scenario from prior publications.14 A
10-kN load cell was used. The suture material was
passed through a centrally placed hole in a threaded
bolt in the Instron testing apparatus. This suture was
tied in a square knot and then wrapped around the bolt
4 to 5 times, until exactly 45 mm of distance remained
between the glenoid and the Instron testing bolt (Figure
2). A 5-N preload was administered at 1 N/s to eliminate
possible slack in the system. Anchor constructs were
preloaded to 5 N (in line with the direction of anchor
insertion), cycled from 5 to 25 N for 25 cycles, and then
pulled to failure at a rate of 15 mm/min. Material creep
was minimized by immediately starting the load to
failure as soon as cycling was terminated. Load to 2
mm of displacement and load to ultimate failure were
calculated during the pull to failure at 15 mm/min. The
5-N preconditioning and cyclic loading was chosen to
match previous studies.26 All raw data and measure-
ments were taken directly from the Instron machine via
Bluehill software.
Statistical Analysis
For our a priori power analysis we assumed a linear model
with estimated values obtained from prior studies.4,20,22
We assumed a 10% loss of data from anchor site compro-
mise in our glenoid specimens due to prior anchor place-
ment or glenoid defects. We included in the model the
effects of subject sex, subject age, insertion site location,
and bone mineral density (BMD), using the true calcu-
lated values from our sample population. An a priori
sample size calculation demonstrated that 6 specimens
were needed to detect their primary outcome of a differ-
ence of 40 N at 2 mm of displacement with a pooled SD of
19 N, a type 1 error of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.20 The
testing of 20 specimens would allow for 99% power to
detect statistical significance (P � .05) with a 40 ± 25 N
difference between groups for load to 2-mm displacement.

 Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to compare
the first- and second-generation suture anchor groups with
each other and alsowiththe solidcontrolgroupwithregardto
mean force required for 2-mm displacement and mean force
required for ultimate pullout. After ANOVA testing, a linear
regression model was employed to investigate the force
required for 2 mm of anchor displacement and ultimate load
to failure as a function of age, sex, BMD, and insertion site.
RESULTS
Ten matched-pair cadaveric shoulders (5 male, 5 female)
with a mean age 74.4 ± 14.01 years were employed in this
study. Mean BMD was 0.61 ± 0.11 g/cm3. Ninety-seven
total anchors were tested to completion (load to failure).
Two millimeters of pullout occurred during the cycling
loading phase of the experiment in 6 anchors (3 Jugger-
knot, 2 Suturefix, 1 Bioraptor). These anchors were
included in the final analysis. The load to 2-mm displace-
ment was 35.96 ± 1.029 N and 42.34 ± 1.013 N for Jugger-
knot and Suturefix, respectively, and 39.0 ± 1.046 N for
the solid anchor Bioraptor (P < .01 for comparisons
between all anchors) (Figure 3). The ultimate load-to-fail-
ure forces for the all-soft suture anchors were 171.52 ±
14.25 N and 182.51 ± 14.03 N for Juggerknot and Suture-
fix, respectively, and 132.87 ± 14.25 N for the Bioraptor
(Figure 4). No significant difference was seen between the
first- and second-generation all-soft suture anchors (P >
.05). However, both first- and second-generation soft
suture anchors performed significantly better than the
solid anchor for load to failure (P < .01). A linear regres-
sion model was employed to investigate the force required
for 2 mm of anchor displacement and ultimate load to fail-
ure as a function of age, sex, BMD, and insertion site

 (Tables 2 and 3). It compared the effect size, a measure of
the strength of a variable’s contribution to a given model,
of both all-soft anchors to the all-solid control. When con-
trolling for these variables, age, sex, and BMD did not
exhibit a significant effect on the variance of the data (P
> .05). The effect size (± standard error) for the Juggerknot
was �2.7786 ± 1.1800 (P < .05) for load to 2-mm displace-
ment, and the effect size for load to failure was 35.74 ±
15.76 (P < .01). The effect size for the Suturefix was
3.851 ± 1.345 (P < .01) for load to 2-mm displacement and
52.82 ± 15.84 (P < .01) for load to ultimate failure.
At 2-mm displacement, no particular glenoid testing site
showed a statistically significant difference. However, for
ultimate load to failure, the model revealed glenoid testing
sites 2, 5, and 6 (which correspond to 2:30, 8:30, and 10:30)
were associated with a statistically significant (P < .01)
increased force requirement for ultimate load to failure,
which is in line with previously reported data.3
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanics
of a first-generation all-soft suture glenoid anchor (Biomet
Juggerknot) and a newer second-generation soft suture
glenoid anchor (Smith & Nephew Suturefix) compared with
a traditional solid anchor control (Smith & Nephew Bior-
aptor) in a human cadaveric model. Specifically, we wanted
to further clarify if the first-generation all-soft suture
anchors have the inferior characteristics in response to
cyclic loading and submaximal displacement that have
been previously reported. If they did, we sought to deter-
mine whether the newer model of second-generation all-
soft suture anchors would mitigate some of the possible
biomechanical concerns reported in first-generation all-
soft suture anchors.20,26 Prior in vitro testing by Mazzoca
et al20 has shown that the Biomet Juggerknot anchor pos-
sesses comparable ultimate loads to failure when compared
with an Arthrex SutureTak biocomposite solid anchor. Our
data demonstrated that both the first- and second-
generation all-soft suture anchors tested demonstrated
ultimate failure loads that were greater than the solid con-
trol (P < .001).
There is clinical concern about submaximal displacement
of an anchor construct, as this may lead to failure of soft
tissue healing to bone despite the construct being “intact.”
Displacement of 1 to 3 mm has been suggested by prior pub-
lications to correlate with clinical failure of rotator cuff
repairs and glenoid labrum repairs.11,27 This submaximal
displacement has been postulated to create micromotion and
increased synovial fluid access to the repair site, leading to
resorption of bone and failure of repair.26 Mazzocca et al20
demonstrated that a solid biocomposite anchor required sig-
nificantly greater load than the Juggerknot all-suture
anchor for 2 mm of labral displacement in a cadaveric labral
repair model. These authors postulated that device micro-
motion could account for the similarity in ultimate load to
failure but inferiority in terms of load to 2-mm displacement.
Pfeiffer et al26 similarly demonstrated significantly larger
anchor displacements in the Juggerknot anchor during
cyclic loading and smaller loads to 2-mm displacement after
cyclic loading when compared with a solid biocomposite
anchor. Their histologic data from canine models showed
some cystic change surrounding each anchor. Whether this
was the result of the body’s reaction to the suture material or
the result of anchor motion and softness is still unclear. Our
data parallel the findings of this prior published data, dem-
onstrating that after cyclical loading, the first-generation
all-soft suture anchor (Juggerknot) possessed the lowest load

 to 2-mm displacement (35.96 ± 1.029 N) of the 3 anchors
tested. This represented a statistically significant difference
when compared with both the control group and the newer
generation all-soft suture anchor (Suturefix) (P < .001).
The linear regression model that investigated the force
required for 2 mm of anchor displacement and ultimate
load to failure as a function of age, sex, BMD, and insertion
site revealed that even in the presence of these other vari-
ables, the biomechanical differences between suture
anchors continued to exhibit a statistically significant
effect. The Juggerknot had a negative effect versus control
(�2.7786 ± 1.1800, P < .05). However, the Suturefix had a
positive effect versus control (3.851 ± 1.345, P < .01) and
performed better than control in ANOVA testing (P < .001).
These effect sizes show the strength of the contribution of
each variable to the linear regression.
Our study demonstrated clear biomechanical differences
between the Suturefix model of newer second-generation
all-soft suture anchors and the first-generation Juggerknot
anchors. We postulate that this is because of the reconfi-
gured locking mechanisms and deployment designs of the
second-generation all-soft suture anchors. Further testing
will be needed to determine if this difference is fully gener-
alizable to other models of second-generation all-soft suture
anchors or against other first-generation anchors. Clinical
studies will be needed to determine if the observed biome-
chanical differences translate into fewer failures in glenoid
labral repairs.
Our study has several limitations. Our model does not
measure direct labral displacement after labral repair but
rather the amount of displacement of the anchor/bone con-
struct. Our force-to-displacement numbers are very similar
to those of previous studies evaluating displacement of the
construct, including the labrum.8,13 Although highly statis-
tically significant, it is unclear but unlikely the approxi-
mately 6 N average difference for force to 2-mm
displacement at 25 cycles would represent a meaningful
clinical difference. While this difference could possibly be
magnified or mitigated in the setting of more testing cycles
or in an in vivo setting, that question cannot be answered
by this study. The average age of the specimens is clearly
significantly older than the typical labral repair population.
However, the average BMD was 0.61 þ 0.11 g/cm3, which is
higher than in previous studies.19,20 Our regression model
also demonstrated that age, sex, BMD, and anchor site had
no significant impact on strength of effect, which seems to
mitigate concerns that these anchors may behave signifi-
cantly differently in younger bone. As the Juggerknot
anchors were sent to us not preloaded onto their inserters,
loading onto the inserter was done by us per the technical
guide. The biomechanical data from this study are similar
to the data from previously published studies, suggesting
this did not change the biomechanical characteristics of the
anchor. All anchors were inserted per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Finally, we chose 25 cycles for our experimen-
tal protocol as opposed to 100 or more. Burkhart et al10
showed that up to 5-mm displacement could occur in just
25 cycles in a rotator cuff model. Barber et al6 demonstrated
that most anchor displacement happens within the first 100
cycles. For the sake of comparison with Pfeiffer et al,26
it may have been beneficial to opt for the full 100 cycles but,
as we had 6 anchors show 2 mm of displacement during the
25 cycles, and as our results were similar to previously
published data, 25 cycles were probably sufficient.
CONCLUSION
A second-generation all-soft suture anchor showed greater
loads to 2 mm of displacement than a first-generation all-soft
suture anchor. Both all-soft suture anchors had higher load to
failure than a solid tap-in anchor. Further research is required
to determine if this is generalizable to all first- and second-
generation all-soft suture anchors. The configuration and
deployment of these newer generation all-soft suture anchors
may mitigate the biomechanical concerns of decreased load to
failure with first-generation all–soft tissue suture anchors.
