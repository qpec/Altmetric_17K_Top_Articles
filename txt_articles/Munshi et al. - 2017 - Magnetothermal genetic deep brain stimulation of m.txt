Abstract Establishing how neurocircuit activation causes particular behaviors requires
modulating the activity of specific neurons. Here, we demonstrate that magnetothermal genetic
stimulation provides tetherless deep brain activation sufficient to evoke motor behavior in awake
mice. The approach uses alternating magnetic fields to heat superparamagnetic nanoparticles on
the neuronal membrane. Neurons, heat-sensitized by expressing TRPV1 are activated with
magnetic field application. Magnetothermal genetic stimulation in the motor cortex evoked
ambulation, deep brain stimulation in the striatum caused rotation around the body-axis, and
stimulation near the ridge between ventral and dorsal striatum caused freezing-of-gait. The
duration of the behavior correlated tightly with field application. This approach provides genetically
and spatially targetable, repeatable and temporarily precise activation of deep-brain circuits
without the need for surgical implantation of any device.

Introduction
Identifying neural circuitry controlling specific behaviors requires the ability to communicate with
specific neurons in the brains of awake, freely moving animals. The most established interface is elec-
trodes implanted in the brain. They provide rapid neuronal stimulation and recording, however, at
the cost of being invasive and with limited spatial and cell type targeting. Optogenetics, visible
light-based stimulation of neurons genetically engineered to express light-gated channels and ion
pumps, provides genetic targeting of specific cell types in combination with rapid stimulation
(Banghart et al., 2004; Boyden et al., 2005). The method quickly gained popularity and has been
used in various animal models to study brain circuits associated with Parkinson’s Disease
(Gradinaru et al., 2009; Kravitz et al., 2010), addictive behavior (Chen et al., 2013; Stefanik et al.,
2013), depression (Nieh et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2016) and anxiety (Tye et al., 2011). However,
optogenetics requires permanent brain implants to guide the light into the brain, and typically, an
optical fiber, tethering the animal to the light source. A third approach, pharmacological neuromo-
dulation using Designer GPCRs Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), provides a
tetherless alternative to optogenetics, but generates a much slower response, ranging from tens of
minutes to hours, as the drug must diffuse to the location of action (Armbruster et al., 2007;
Urban and Roth, 2015). The ideal experimental approach to deep brain stimulation would combine
minimal invasiveness - to avoid perturbing the behavior, sufficient speed - to permit real-time
response, and cell-specific targeting.
Magnetic-field-based stimulation has considerable potential to provide fast, tetherless, and
implant-free deep brain stimulation because magnetic fields are minimally scattered, minimally

 absorbed by tissue, and travel freely through space (Walsh and Cowey, 2000). These characteristics
of magnetothermal stimulation simplifies a range of experimental assays, which are challenging to
perform using current techniques, and permit new types of experiments: The absence of tethers will
permit novel social behavioral assays in a group of animals freely interacting in an arena, while only a
subgroup of them gets stimulated. As magnetic stimulation only occurs when the animal resides
within the magnetic field, the field geometry can be adapted to coincide with another signal for con-
ditional place preference or feeding assays. Similarly, magnetically stimulating multiple sites in one
brain to study network connectivity requires only multiple injections of solutions, possibly along a
shared injection path, as opposed to multiple cannula implantations. Furthermore, the absence of
any physical connection from brain to skull minimizes tissue damage and immune response
(Chen et al., 2015). Lastly, assays using animals easily startled by the flashes of visible light used in
optogenetics, such as Zebrafish, would benefit from magnetic stimulation. Therefore, a reliable mag-
netic field stimulation method would not only simplify experiments, currently performed using exist-
ing techniques, but enable a series of novel assays.
The challenge in implementing magnetic stimulation has been to develop a transducer capable of
harnessing the energy of the magnetic field and translating it into a robust biological signal with
high temporal and spatial specificity. Magnetic fields only interact with magnetic dipoles. The overall
magnetic dipole of a particle is caused by the particle’s intrinsic magnetic moment, which results
from the orientation of a large number of spins of the ions making up the nanoparticle. The spins in
a ferromagnet interact strongly, causing their parallel alignment to persist over time, and creating a
permanent magnetic moment. In ferromagnetic particles, the magnetic moment is fixed to the parti-
cle crystal structure, causing a net magnetic dipole of the particle, which interacts strongly with
external magnetic fields. However, the permanent dipoles of individual particles interact also in
absence of an external field, causing aggregation of particles, rendering them unsuitable for
neurostimulation.
In very small particles made from materials that are ferromagnetic in bulk, the spins interact, but
at room temperature the direction of their magnetic moment relative to the particle fluctuates rap-
idly (Brown, 1963). After an external magnetic field aligns the moments, this alignment persists for
a brief moment of time to permit the interaction. Such particles are called superparamagnetic
(Bean and Livingston, 1959). They are the preferred transducers for magnetic biostimulation
(Xu and Sun, 2013; Pankhurst et al., 2009). Superparamagnetic particles can been used as a trans-
ducer of magnetic field energy exploiting two different mechanisms: In a strong external DC field,
the induced magnetic dipoles in neighboring NPs interact sufficiently strongly to aggregate the NPs
and a field gradient exerts a small force (Mannix et al., 2008). Alternatively, our group showed that
applying an alternating magnetic field (AMF) to superparamagnetic nanoparticles may be used to
locally
generate
heat,
which

nearby

TRPV1
channels
(Huang et al., 2010). This later approach, when used to stimulate TRPV1+ neurons, is referred to as
‘magnetothermal genetics’ (Chen et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2010; Stanley et al., 2012).
Activating a channel requires overcoming an energy barrier slightly larger than the thermal fluctu-
ation energy (Ethermal ¼ kBT ~ 4 � 10�21Jat 37˚C, with Boltzmann constant kB). The maximally delivered
energy per transducer particle depends on the mechanism of interaction with the magnetic field. In
the case of dipole-dipole interaction of two NPs with magnetic dipole m and a distance r apart, their
interaction energy is Ediople ~ �0m2=4pr3 (�0 being the vacuum permeability). In a 0.1 T external field,
the magnetic dipole of two core-shell NPs used in this study is strong enough that their Edipole is
larger than the thermal energy as soon as they are closer than 22 nm (Garcı
´a-Prieto et al., 2016;
Zhang et al., 2015a) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A B). However, for horse ferritin the magnetic
dipole at 0.1 T per particle is so weak that the dipole interaction energy is a lot smaller than the ther-
mal energy even if the ferritin molecules were touching each other (Garcı
´a-Prieto et al., 2016;
Zhang et al., 2015a) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).
In magnetothermal stimulation, the transducer converts the energy of the external alternating
magnetic field into heat. This process depends on the frequency f and field strength H of the exter-
nal magnetic field, the time t over which thermal fluctuations randomize the orientation of the
moments in the particle, the particle volume and magnetization. The synthesized nanoparticles used
in this study, heat by 450 W/g at 500 kHz and 15 kA/m, while horse ferritin does not heat in the
same AMF (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Even if increasing the frequency driving ferritin to 50

 MHz and 0.15 kA/m horse ferritin heats less than 1 W/g. In this comparison, the product H � f is left
constant, as it is a measure for background effects in tissue (Atkinson et al., 1984; Chen et al.,
2015). Hence, transducers coupling either via dipole-dipole or magnetothermal mechanism, deliver
sufficient energy if using consisting of synthesized superparamagnetic NPs. This is in contrast to the

of

magnetogenetics
(Meister,
2016;
Stanley
et
al.,
2015;
2012; Wheeler et al., 2016).
In magnetothermal genetic stimulation, the heat needs to be delivered to the TRPV1 channel effi-
ciently, avoiding excess heat loss to the surrounding buffer fluid. Classically, magnetic nanoparticle-
based hyperthermia heating uses a dense suspension of nanoparticles, a ferrofluid, in which the
neighboring MNPs screen the cooling. An isolated MNP delivers only a few femtowatts of heat,
which dissipates rapidly into the volume of water. In a two-dimensional dense array of MNPs on the
membrane, the neighboring MNPs screen the lateral cooling, leaving only the direction normal to
the membrane for heat dissipation. Membrane-bound MNPs deliver sufficient power to raise the
temperature in a thin sheet along the membrane (Huang et al., 2010). Therefore, we aimed to use
AMF heating of membrane-targeted MNP to evoke behavior in awake animals.
Here, we report the first robust and repeated magnetothermal genetic activation of motor behav-
ior in awake, freely moving mice using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), attached to the plasma mem-
brane of temperature-sensitized TRPV1+ neurons, deep inside the brain. We demonstrate successful
magnetothermal activation of three separate brain regions, motor cortex, dorsal striatum and
the ridge between dorsal and ventral striatum. All three have been previously activated either opto-
genetically (Gradinaru et al., 2007; Kravitz et al., 2010) or chemogenetically (Arenkiel et al.,
2008). We observed the same behavioral responses as had been reported resulting from optoge-
netic or chemogenetic neurostimulation in those areas. We were able to achieve successful neurosti-
mulation in vivo without raising the overall tissue temperature by binding MNPs to the neuronal
membrane. This magnetothermal method does not require any fixed implants or tethers, thereby
permitting repeatable stimulation with real-time response monitoring and recording in awake freely
moving mice capabilities.
Results
Principles of magnetothermal genetic neurostimulation
To achieve fast and robust neuronal stimulation in awake, freely behaving mice, we depolarized
heat-sensitized (TRPV1+) neurons via magnetic-field-induced heating of superparamagnetic MNPs
(Figure 1A,B,F). The MNPs were targeted to the neuronal membrane via an A2B5 antibody specific
to neuronal glycosylated membrane proteins. This approach provided specific and dense labeling of
neuronal membranes (Figure 1E), minimizing the amount of MNPs required for activation.
Development and synthesis of an optimal magnetothermal transducer
An effective magnetothermal transducer must convert the alternating magnetic field energy effi-
ciently into heat, be targetable to specific cells and sufficiently small to easily diffuse between the
neurons in the brain (<30 nm) (Thorne and Nicholson, 2006). Exchange-coupled core-shell MNPs
combining soft and hard magnetic materials (Cobalt Oxide and Manganese oxide) in a core-shell
geometry, permit independent optimization of the MNP’s size and magnetic properties (Lee et al.,
2011; Zhang et al., 2015b). Thus, these MNPs can be tuned to heat efficiently at magnetic field fre-
quencies, known to safely penetrate tissue (<1 MHz) (Young et al., 1980), while maintaining a diam-
eter of less than 30 nm.
We synthesized MNPs with an 8.0 ± 1.0 nm Co-ferrite core surrounded by a 2.25 nm Mn-ferrite
shell. To confer colloidal stability in physiological buffers, these MNPs were then encapsulated in the
polymer PMA (dodecyl-grafted-poly-(isobutylene-alt-maleic-anhydride) (Lin et al., 2008). The PMA
coating added 5.4 ± 1.4 nm to the MNP diameter (Figure 1D). We carefully analyzed the experimen-
tal magnetic and heating properties of these MNPs and found the results to be well described by
the theory of superparamagnetic NPs (Zhang et al., 2015b). The efficiency of particular MNPs in
converting AMF power to heat is measured and quantified as specific loss in power (SLP) in W/g.
The MNPs used in this study have an SLP of 733.3 ± 2.8 W/g at 37.0 kA/m and 412.5 kHz, close to
the theoretical maximum for particles of this size (Zhang et al., 2015a).

 Figure 1. Magnetothermal genetic neurostimulation activates TPRV1 channels by heating membrane-bound
magnetic nanoparticles using an alternating magnetic field. (A) Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) (brown),
encapsulated in PMA polymer (blue ring) are functionalized with NeutrAvidin (green), conjugated with Dylight550
fluorophores (red stars), and attached to the neuronal membrane via biotinylated antibodies targeting membrane
proteins. The neurons are transfected to express temperature-sensitive TRVP1 channels and the calcium indicator
GCaMP6f. (B) Applying an alternating magnetic field (‘AMF on’) heats the membrane-bound MNPs. This heat
dissipates, raising the temperature locally near the membrane, which activates the TRPV1 channels. The resulting
calcium influx depolarizes the neurons and is measured as a transient intensity increase of the GCaMP6f
fluorescence. (C) The experimental setup combining the alternating magnetic field (AMF) application with
fluorescence microscopy for in-vitro studies. The AMF (dotted lines) is produced by a five turn, continuously water
cooled coil made of copper pipe. The coil and capacitor C form an electrical resonator that is driven by a 7.5 kW
alternating power source. Neurons grown on cover glass are placed directly underneath the coil in a non-metallic
sample holder. The AMF causes eddy currents in metal parts, including the microscope objective (OBJ). Any focus
drifts are compensated by a fast laser autofocus (AF) (also see Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Components

 To target the MNPs specifically to neurons, we functionalized them with NeutrAvidin which then
binds to biotinylated antibodies. We used either antibodies against endogenous neuronal surface
markers, such as anti-CD56 (Thy-1), anti-CD90 (NCAM) or anti-A2B5, or against a fluorescent protein
tag. The later allowed genetic targeting of specific cells, transiently expressing a surface protein with
an extracellular GFP or mCherry (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B).
The local temperature rise in the vicinity of the nanoparticles was measured by fluorescence inten-
sity changes of a Dylight 550 fluorophore integrated in the NeutrAvidin coating. The fluorescence
intensities of molecular fluorophores are sufficiently temperature dependent to provide a molecular
scale thermometer (Huang et al., 2010). We found that the fluorescence intensity of DyLight 550
decreased by 2.2% per degree temperature rise (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).
Membrane-bound nanoparticles produced efficient, well localized
heating
To open a sufficient number of TPRV1 channels to affect neuronal firing, the cell surface temperature
needs to rise only a few degrees above the physiological temperature (Huang et al., 2010;
Chen et al., 2015). First, we determined the efficacy of AMF-driven heating of MNPs in suspension,
aka ferrofluid, and then separately of membrane-bound MNPs, using identical experimental condi-
tions and AMF (Figure 2). Bath temperature was measured continuously using an immersed fiber
optic thermometer (Figure 2A), while the membrane temperature was measured using the fluores-
cence intensity of DyLight 550 integrated in the NeutrAvidin coating of the membrane-bound MNPs
(Figure 2B). The AMF (22.4 kA/m at 412.5 kHz) was generated in a custom built, water-cooled coil,
surrounding the sample dish, which was mounted on an inverted microscope.
In the MNP suspension sample, the entire bath temperature (along with the cells) rose by two
degrees (Figure 2C). Following a seven second AMF heating, the MNP suspension required more
than 1 min to cool back to the initial temperature. Conversely, when the MNPs were bound to the
cell membrane, only the membrane, and not the bath, was heated by several degrees (Figure 2D).
After removing the AMF, the membrane temperature returned to the initial value within a few sec-
onds. Hence, using membrane-bound MNPs provides a temporal precision of few seconds for termi-
nating the magnetothermal neurostimulation.
The rates of temperature increase depend on the concentration of MNPs. For various volume
concentrations of MNPs we measured rates from 0.1 to 0.5˚C/s (Figure 2E). For membrane-bound
MNPs, the rates were 0.1 to 1.0˚C/s, depending on the area density of MNP (Figure 2F). Plotting
the heating rate as a function of MNP concentration collapses these measurements. For suspension
heating,
the
heating
rate
depends
linearly
on
the
MNP
concentration
and
is
fit
to
5.8 � 10�4 ± 1.9�10�6˚C.mm3/s (Figure 2G). Hence, the heating power per MNP is 2.55 ± 0.94 fW/
particle, consistent with the prediction from magnetic measurements, 3.34 fW/particle (Zhang et al.,
2015a). In the membrane-bound case, the graph of the heating rate versus MNP area density is fit
to 1.1 � 10�3 ± 6.7�10�5 C.mm2/s (Figure 2H). Comparing the fit obtained for the membrane heat-
ing to the suspension heating shows that the volume of water heated in the membrane case corre-
sponds to a 0.5-mm thick slab of MNP suspension. In reality, the temperature away from the
membrane drops inversely with the distance from the membrane (Baffou et al., 2013). Figure 2I
and J visualize MNP spacing for membrane and suspension cases, assuming homogenous MNP
distribution.
To determine a lower bound for the field strength of AMF required for local membrane heating,
we compared the membrane temperature increase in HEK cells decorated with MNPs at two differ-
ent field strength, 12 kA/m and 30 kA/m (both at 412 kHz). A 30 s application of the weaker AMF
heated the membrane as much as a 5 s application of the stronger AMF (Figure 2—figure supple-
ment 1). However, at 12 kA/m AMF, once the local temperature has rising more than 2˚C above the
environment, cooling to the environment becomes comparable to the heating. Hence, even during
longer AMF applications the maximal local temperature increase will remain in a safe range for cells.
Overall, we found that for membrane-bound MNP, the duration of AMF to achieve the two-
degree rise necessary to activate TPRV1 channels varies between 2.1 s and 4.2 s (Figure 2F). The
amount of MNPs required for similar heating rates in suspension heating is a few orders higher, 20–
30 mg/ml (Figure 2E – H).

 Thermal activation of TPRV1+ hippocampal neurons
To measure the response of TRPV1+ hippocampal neurons to thermal stimulation, we used the fast
genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2015; Grewe et al., 2010), and
deconvolved the Ca2+ transients to uncover the underlying spike train (Figure 3—figure supple-
ment 1). First, we investigated the spontaneous firing rate of 10 day old TRPV1+ hippocampal neu-
rons across a range of physiologically relevant bath temperatures. From 32˚C to 36˚C, the Calcium
spiking rate was temperature independent. As bath temperature was increased from 37˚C to 39˚C,
spontaneous activity of TRPV1+ neurons increased from 1.5 ± 1.2 action potentials (APs) per 5 s to
13 ± 3 APs in the same period. At 39˚C, only about 15–20% of rat TRPV1 channels open
(Grandl et al., 2010), but the resulting Calcium influx is sufficient to trigger neuronal activity because
TRPV1 has an about 1,000-fold higher single channel conductance than ChR2 (Lo
´renz-Fonfrı
´a and
Heberle, 2014; Studer and McNaughton, 2010). In control neurons, without TRPV1, we observed a
slight decrease of the spiking rate, to 1 ± 1 APs per 5 s (Figure 3A). Detailed analysis of single cal-
cium transients in the absence of TRPV1, and with TRPV1 at channel activating temperatures
showed, that, within the resolution of GCaMP6f-based calcium imaging, TRPV1 activity does not
change the shape of the calcium transient and the underlying AP (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).
Therefore, expressing of TRPV1 in hippocampal neurons renders their firing rate highly heat-sensitive
without disrupting natural function.
Membrane-localized MNP heating stimulates cultured hippocampal
neurons
To measure the MNP heating evoked stimulation, we transfected cultured hippocampal neurons
with TRPV1 and GCaMP6f, then decorated the plasma membrane with MNPs. The red fluorescence
of the DyLight550-labeled MNPs was detected all along the neuronal membrane, indicating good
surface labeling (Figure 1E).

 When exposed to an AMF (22.4 kA/m at 412.5 kHz, 5 s), MNP decorated TRPV1+ neurons
showed increased spiking, measured as calcium transients (Figures 1F and 3B). The spike train of
each neuron was derived from the recorded Calcium transients by convolving an estimated spike
train with the recorded GCaMP6f calcium signal of a single Action Potential; then calculating the

during the AMF (n = 13, **p=0.0028, unpaired T-test), and 12.1 ± 2.0 per 5 s immediately following the AMF

 residual between the measured and the computed calcium trace; and adjusting the estimated spike
train to minimize the residual (see Materials and methods and Figure 3—figure supplement 1)
(Yaksi and Friedrich, 2006). Compared to basal activity (1.8 ± 0.6 APs) during 5 s before AMF appli-
cation, the spiking increased significantly to 4.5 ± 1.2 APs during the 5 s AMF (p=0.0028, unpaired
T-test), and 12.1 ± 2.0 APs in the 5 s after the AMF was removed (p=0.0002, unpaired T-test) (n = 13
cells, three cultures) (Figure 3D, Figure 3—figure supplement 2). During the AMF application, the
membrane temperature of MNP-decorated TRPV1+ neurons increased by 2˚C, as measured by the
DyLight550 fluorescence (Figure 3C). The stimulation is very reproducible with 87.5% of the cells
responding to second stimulation, following 5 min after the first.
Latency and consistency of magnetothermal stimulation
We analyzed the consistency of activation, increase in firing rate and number of active cells, as well
as the activation latency. Figure 3E shows the activation latency, the temporal delay between the
start of field application and the first spiking event, for all recorded stimulations (79 neurons, 6 cul-
tures, various duration of AMF). 87% of neurons spike during the first 5 s of field application, and
64% of the neurons fire already within 2 to 3 s after the field is turned on (Figure 3E). A histogram
of the latencies of all cells exposed to 5-s field stimulation was fitted with a Poisson distribution giv-
ing an expectation value of 2.18 ± 0.17 s (Figure 3F). This data shows the fastest magneto-thermal
stimulation to date (Chen et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2010). Next, we determined whether mag-
neto-thermal stimulation is also capable of activating quiescent neurons, which were not already
near the depolarization threshold. We defined neurons with at least one calcium transient during any
5-s period as active. At basal conditions, 53.7 �1.6% of the neurons were active in cultures. Five-sec-
ond AMF application increased the active population to 80.5 �5.1% of neurons (Figure 3G). We
showed that 5 s of magneto-thermal stimulation not only increases the firing rates of already active
neurons (Figure 3D), but also increases the percentage of active cells in a population (Figure 3G).
Magnetothermal genetic stimulation of the motor cortex evoked mice
to run along the periphery of the arena
Next, we verified that that thermal magnetothermal genetic stimulation in the brain could be specific
and sufficient to evoke precise behavior in an awake, moving animal. We aimed to evoke a response
in freely moving, awake mice, that could be easily and rapidly detected. Repeatable on and off
switching with reasonable latencies would demonstrate causality. Specifically, we chose several
motor responses which have been previously evoked with chemogenetic or optogenetic activation.
Successful secondary motor cortex activation evoking running has been reported using optoge-
netics (Gradinaru et al., 2007). We aimed to reproduce these responses, using magnetothermal
stimulation of motor cortex neurons (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). While some expression of
TRPV1 in the rodent brain has been reported (Basbaum et al., 2009), robust magnetothermal
genetic stimulation requires uniform, sustained over-expression of TRPV1 in the targeted neurons.
We achieved TRPV1 overexpression in the mouse motor cortex by delivering adeno-associated virus
serotype 5 (AAV5) as a vehicle for the TRPV1 transgene under the neuron-specific synapsin-1 pro-
moter hSyn (AAV5-hSyn-TRPV1) by stereotactic injection (Ku
¨gler et al., 2003). However, AAV is too
small to package a vector, encoding TRPV1 and a fluorescent protein marker. Hence, for some
experiments, we also created a lentivirus carrying the genes for TRPV1 and a red fluorescent protein
with nuclear targeting sequence behind an internal ribosome entry site (EF1a-TRPV1-IRES-DSRed).
Both, AAV5 and lentivirus, led to robust expression in vivo, permitting stimulation of specific
behavior.
Motor cortex neurons were heat sensitized, by unilaterally injecting AAV5-hSyn-TRPV1 (Carvalho-
de-Souza et al., 2015; Lein et al., 2007). Two to four weeks later, 500–600 ng of antibody-conju-
gated MNPs were injected in the same location. (AP = 1, ML = 0.5, DV = 0.5 (all in mm)). Using
immuno-histology, we confirmed virus-induced TRPV1 expression and binding of MNPs to neurons
in the targeted motor cortex area (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).
All 6 mice in a total of 14 trials began running along the periphery of the observation arena (AMF
was 7.5 kA/m and 570 kHz; Figure 4A,B, Figure 4—figure supplement 3). To illustrate the contrast
between the induced and the resting behaviors, the track of the head (color marked for automated
object recognition) of a representative mouse is shown in Figure 4C. The running along the

 0.21 ± 0.19 rev/min to 3.27 ± 0.30 rev/min (Figure 4F; p=0.0003). Over all 14 trials in 6 mice, the
angular speed was significantly faster during AMF applications, 2.81 ± 0.20 rev/min, as compared to
0.34 ± 0.08 rev/min during the rest periods between the fields (Figure 4G; p=5.2�10�9; 95% C.I.
[0.29, 0.39] and [2.69, 2.93] rev/min). Figure 4—figure supplement 1 shows seven individual
responses to the simulation (four mice). In all trials, we observed a strong running response, but
some mice changed directions occasionally. Hence, we plot the angular distance travelled, in addi-
tion to the angular displacement.
Repeat stimulation of the same animal evoked increased locomotion reliably in each trial.
Figure 4D shows four 1-min field applications within a 15-min trial. Repeated sessions on the same
mice demonstrate that the sensitization persists over several days (Figure 4—figure supplement 4).
There is a tight temporal correlation between AMF heating and the observed behavior: Each time,
shortly after the AMF is applied, the mouse begins to run. The stimulated ambulation persists
throughout the duration of the field application and ends shortly after the AMF is removed. For an
AMF strength of 7.5 kA/m rms at 570 kHz, the behavioral response began 22.8 ± 2.6 s (n = 14, 6
mice, Figure 4H) after the beginning of the AMF. This latency of behavior onset is consistent with
the fast in vitro response, because heating depends on the square of the AMF strength, which for
the in vivo case was about one third of that in in vitro experiments. Performing AMF heating on
MNP decorated HEK cells showed that lowering the field strength by a third increased the required
time to reach a two-degree increase to 20 s (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The delay is compara-
ble to optogenetic stimulations in the motor cortex, also using virus delivered activator genes
(Airan et al., 2009). After the AMF is terminated, the ambulation behavior continued for 14.7 ± 2.5
s, likely the time required to cool the membrane-bound MNPs (Figure 4H). Using membrane-bound
nanoparticles for magnetothermal neuro-stimulation ensures fast on and off kinetics because only a
miniscule volume of space is heated and cooled.
Mice injected with only AAV5-hSyn-TRPV1 virus or only MNPs showed no response to AMF appli-
cation (Videos 3 and 4 respectively) demonstrating that neither MNP injection nor TRPV1 expression
alone is sufficient to evoke the response. Observable stimulation occurred only when AMF was
applied in the presence of the temperature-gated ion channel, TRPV1, and the energy transducing
MNPs in the same brain locations. For animals lacking either TRPV1 overexpression or MNP, AMF
application caused no significant deviation from baseline rotation speedEquation (four individual
mice for each, Figure 4I). On the other hand, in all mice injected with both MNP and TRPV1 at the
same brain location, angular speed increased significantly with AMF, 3.17 ± 0.17 rev/min compared
to the baseline speed of 0.42 ± 0.07 rev/min (n = 10, p=1.1�10�5; unpaired T-test; 95% C.I. [0.32,
0.52] and [2.94, 3.40] rev/min) (Figure 4I). Membrane targeting the MNPs is essential as animals
injected with virus and MNPs without the anti-A2B5 antibody were insensitive to the AMF applica-
tion (Figure 4I, Figure 4—figure supplement 3).
Deep brain magnetothermal genetic stimulations in striatum causes
rotation around body axis
Next, we investigated the effectiveness of mag-
netothermal genetic stimulation in the striatum, a
deep brain region. Chemogenetic activation of
the caudate putamen nuclei in the striatum has
previously been shown to evoke increased loco-
motion in the form of rotation around the body
axis (Arenkiel et al., 2008; Kreitzer and Mal-
enka, 2008). To replicate these results with mag-
netothermal stimulation, we injected AAV5-hSyn-
TRPV1 virus and MNPs into the caudate putamen
nuclei in the dorsal striatum, 3 mm deep (AP = 0,
ML = 2.3 from bregma)(Li et al., 2015; Oh et al.,
2014). Immuno-histology confirmed successful
TRPV1 over-expression, MNP injection to the tar-
get (Figure 5—figure supplements 1,2), and
good overlap of both (Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 3. During AMF application, the mouse

 turns around its body axis, so that its head tracks circles of 22 ± 5 mm radius (Figure 5A-C, Video 3).
These turns were very regular and quick (19.3 ± 2.2 mm/s; Figure 5D), resulting in 4.7 ± 0.8 revolu-
tions per minute (Figure 5E). This behavior was very different from the running motion observed
during motor cortex activation, where the mice ran at speeds of 83.8 ± 3.75 mm/s, close to the edge
of the arena, which has a radius of 50 mm. In this case, the turn radii of the circles made by the mice
were considerably smaller, and the linear speed lower. The turning motion evoked by stimulating in
the striatum was very reproducible from trial to trial and across animals (Figures 5F, 12 trials, 4 ani-
mals). The mice turned contralateral to the injection in 11 out of 12 trials and did never reverse the
direction of turning after initiating the motion.
The average response of four striatum targeted mice in 12 trials was a 6-fold increase in angular
speed during AMF activation, 2.86 ± 0.19 rev/min compared to a baseline rate of 0.47 ± 0.09 rev/
min (Figure 5G; p=3.4�10�7; unpaired T-test; 95% C.I. [0.42, 0.56] and [2.71, 3.01] rev/min). The
observed response is consistent with a prior report of dorsal striatum stimulation by capsaicin activa-
tion of TRPV1 channels at the same brain coordinates (Arenkiel et al., 2008).
In addition to multiple stimulation trial during one session, we performed several sessions suc-
cessfully over 54 hr (Figure 5—figure supplement 4).
Magnetothermal genetic deep brain stimulation at the ridge between
dorsal and ventral striatum causes freezing of gait
To evoke magnetothermally a response that does not involve increased locomotion, we aimed to
demonstrate stimulation freezing of gait. The Deisseroth team showed that optogenetic stimulation
near the ridge between dorsal and ventral striatum inhibits voluntary locomotion (Gradinaru et al.,
2009; Kravitz et al., 2010). Therefore, we took advantage of the fact that the stimulation depth is
only limited by brain region accessibility in terms of virus and MNP delivery, and injected AAV5-
hSyn-TRPV1 virus and MNPs at the ridge between dorsal and ventral striatum (AP = 0.01, ML = 2.3)
(Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Application of AMF caused freezing of gait (FOG), characterized
by the inhibition of locomotion, with all four paws locked in place while the mouse was still able to
move its head in all directions, neck onward. FOG is common in patients with advanced Parkinson
disease (Moore et al., 2008). Videos 6 and 7, Figure 6A–C shows tracks of the mouse neck. Ambu-
latory activities diminished markedly during stimulation, which can also be seen from the paw tracks
(Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Apart from FOG, there was an excessive outward stretching of
the limbs along with the inability of the front extremities to follow the head motion (Figure 6D). Dur-
ing AMF application, the average linear speed decreased significantly, from 17.7 ± 2.2 mm/s before
stimulation to essentially rest, 1.04 ± 0.13 mm/s (Figure 6C; two mice, six trials; p=0.0006; unpaired
T-test; 95% C.I. [15.4, 20.1] and [0.90, 1.18] mm/s). The tracked speed during the AMF was indistin-
guishable from that of a fixed marker on the arena floor (0.52 ± 0.11 mm/s).
Discussion
Our work demonstrates that magnetothermal genetic stimulation can effectively activate specific
neuronal circuits in awake, freely moving mice to evoke defined behaviors quickly, robustly and
repeatedly. Three different circuits and behaviors have been stimulated magnetothermally and com-
pared to prior opto- or chemogenetic stimulation of the same circuits: running, in response to motor
cortex stimulation (prior optogenetic work: [Gradinaru et al., 2009]); rotation around the body axis,
after stimulation deep in the striatum (prior chemogenetic work: (Arenkiel et al., 2008); and freezing
of gait, in response to stimulation on ridge between dorsal and ventral striatum (prior optogenetic
work: [Kravitz et al., 2010]). We successfully evoked opposing behaviors, running or freezing of gait
by targeting the dorsal striatum or the ridge between the dorsal and ventral striatum, respectively,
locations in the brain only 1 mm apart. This clearly demonstrates that the evoked behavior is the
result of stimulating a specific neuronal circuit, and that the heat generated by the MNPs in response
to the AMF is sufficiently localized to the neurons targeted.
Magnetothermal genetic stimulation leads rapidly to the targeted motor behavior, observable
within 15–20 s of AMF activation. This brief delay is not an intrinsic limit of the technique, but rather
the result of a weak average field at the site of the mouse head (Figure 4—figure supplement 5).
As the heating rate is proportional to the square of magnetic field strength, the threefold weaker
field caused approximately nine times longer latency in the mouse than observed in the in vitro

 studies. It is technically feasible to generate
AMFs large enough to reduce the latency for
magnetothermal stimulation of behavior in mice
to times only marginally slower than electrophys-
iological or optogenetic stimulation, and signifi-
cantly faster than chemical stimulation using
DREADDs (Armbruster et al., 2007). Likewise,
our results show that the evoked locomotor
behavior diminished quickly within 15 s after
removal of the field. Tight temporal on- and off-
control is vital for precise correlation of circuit
stimulation
with
behavioral
observation,
and
thus far had only been achieved using optoge-
netics, but not magneto- or chemogenetics.
The short on- and off-time delays of magne-
tothermal genetic stimulation permit multiple
simulations in short observation times. In our
experiments, three to four one-minute stimula-
tions were possible within a 10–15 min experi-
ment. Such repeatability is crucial for obtaining statistically significant behavioral data. Other
temporal profiles of stimulation are easily achieved, permitting studies of memory formation, or with
variations in the assay. Most importantly, stimulation from several seconds to many minutes are eas-
ily achievable, filling an important gap between faster optogenetics and slower chemogenetics.
In this study, MNPs were bound via the A2B5 antibody, which indiscriminately recognizes all gly-
cosylated membrane proteins. It yielded the highest nanoparticle density on the cell surface and
accordingly, achieved the most rapid heating. However, we also successfully used anti-CD56 (Thy-1),
anti-CD90 (NCAM) for endogenous membrane proteins, as well as anti-GFP to target overexpress-
ing GFP-labeled membrane proteins. Magnetothermal genetics in tandem with membrane-bound
nanoparticles provides three major benefits: First, it provides improved localization and neuron-spe-
cific targeting. The stimulation region is spatially better confined as the antibody binding limits the
distance that the MNP diffuse into the brain
(Figure 5—figure supplement 5). Also, only cell
types with the specific membrane receptor tar-
geted by the antibody bind the nanoparticles
(Figure 5—figure supplement 6). Second, the
heating is restricted to the vicinity of the mem-
brane. This enables orthogonal targeting in
which the TRPV1 channel is expressed in one
specific cell type and the MNPs are targeted to
a second cell type, and magnetothermal stimula-
tion would only occur at their synapse. Third,
membrane targeting provides improved tempo-
ral resolution because only a minuscule volume
near the membrane is heated which cools off
immediately after the AMF is removed. This also
delivers less overall heat to the brain. Lastly, we
obtained robust activation with as little as 500
ng of nanoparticles, which is 200-fold lower than
the volume of nanoparticle suspension for of
brain neuron stimulation in anesthetized mice
(Chen et al., 2015).
One concern for magnetothermal stimulation
may be that the MNPs either directly or via the
membrane heating induce cell death. We suc-
cessfully repeated stimulation of the same ani-
mals for seven to eight trials over a few days

 without observing any change in normal or evoked behavior. Also, histology of brains after 20 one-
min AMF applications, spread over three sessions during a 24 hr period, showed intact MNP deco-
rated neurons (Figure 5—figure supplement 7). Hence, if there is any damage, it is undetectable in
histology and behavior. Thermal damage can be avoided by choosing the field strength to be suffi-
ciently small so that the cooling to the environment limits the possible temperature rise to a few
degrees.
As magnetothermal genetic stimulation does
not require a physical connection to the animal, it
offers unprecedented freedom in designing novel
behavioral assays. For instance, several animals
could share the stimulation arena simultaneously,
and only animals injected with MNPs would be
affected by the AMF. This provides the ability to
study stimulated and unaffected animals simulta-
neously, either as controls or to study their inter-
action. Absence of a tether or implant also has
the advantage that animals do not carry any
external marker, which may interfere with normal
social group behavior. Additionally, exclusive to
magnetothermal genetic stimulation, stimulation
only occurs when the animal is within the mag-
netic field. Hence, adapting the field geometry
allows controlling the stimulation timing and con-
dition. This is ideal for space or location depen-

One limitation of the current implementation

 300 cm3. However, stronger power sources are
available to produce AMF in larger volumes,
sufficient to cover the entire brain of non-
human primates as well as humans. Magneto-
thermal stimulation may provide an alternative
to optogenetics for deep brain stimulation in
non-human primates. First, large brains move
significantly relative to the skull, potentially dis-
placing electrodes and glass fibers from their
original target. As the transducer for magneto-
thermal stimulation is attached to the cells and
not the skull, the stimulation location remains
with the originally targeted cells. Second, acti-
vation of behavior in non-human primates may
require coordinated activation of several dis-
tinct brain regions and each region may be
larger than the volume covered by an optical
fiber (Han, 2012; Inoue et al., 2015). Magne-
tothermal genetic stimulation can stimulate multiple distinct brain locations easily, as the delivery
of the MNP is minimally invasive and the magnetic field covers the entire volume. The actual
stimulated volume can be controlled by the MNP amount and rate of injection. Therefore, mag-
netothermal genetic stimulation is well suited for deep brain stimulation in non-human primates.

 Just as for other genetic techniques, one hurdle to application in humans will be safety concerns
around injecting virus and nanoparticles into the brain. However, the body’s reaction to nanoparticle
injections has been extensively studied and can be minimized by using a biologically compatible
nanoparticle surface coating. The invasive brain surgery currently used to inject the MNP may soon
be replaced by MNP delivery via the bloodstream as recent research has shown, that focused ultra-
sound can transiently make the blood-brain barrier permeable to virus particles (Price, 2015). Over-
all, magnetothermal neurostimulation offers a series of advantages for deep brain stimulation or
silencing in non-human primates and primates.
Materials and methods
Magnetic field generation
Alternating magnetic fields were generated by water-cooled coils, driven by a 7.5 kW power genera-
tor from MSI Automation. The instrument is separated into two units (Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure
supplement 4). The power source (also the control unit) was some distance away from the micro-
scope while the head stage, on which the hyperthermia coil was mounted, was placed over the
microscope stage through an opening in the incubator. The coil was placed directly over the sample
chamber. Circulating water cooled any resistive element in the systems. Magnetic field for all in-vitro
experiments were generated using a 5 mm F, five turn copper coil. Field measurements at the sam-
ples’ site were done separately using a Fluxtrol Magnetic Probe. For in vivo studies, the same instru-
ment was used to power a 10 mm F, two-turn water cooled copper coil (Figure 4A, Figure 4—
figure supplement 5).
Magnetic nanoparticle preparation
Superparamagnetic core-shell Co-Mn-Ferrite nanoparticles (MNP) with a diameter of 12.5 ± 1.0 nm
(Figure 1D) were synthesized and characterized according to published methods(Zhang et al.,
2015a). The MNP were transferred to water by coating with PMA (poly-isobutylene-maleic anhy-
dride) following published protocols(Lin et al., 2008). The PMA-coated MNP were functionalized by
covalently attaching fluorescently labeled Neutravidin, which could then bind to a biotinylated
antibody.
Experimental and theoretical magnetic nanoparticle characterization
Magnetization data for Horse spleen ferritin was generously shared with us by Dr. I. Orue (SGIker,
Universidad del Paı
´s Vasco UPV/EHU, 48940 Leioa, Spain). Magnetization data for the synthesized
core-shell MNP, Co-Mn-Ferrite nanoparticles (MNP) was also measured by Dr. I. Orue; Figure 1—
figure supplement 1A . For calculation of magnetic dipole interaction energy (Figure 1—figure
supplement 1), spherical MNPs were assumed to be point dipoles, with moments aligned perpen-
dicular to the dipole axis. The interaction energy, then is given by
U r
ð Þ ¼ �0
4pr3 � 2�2

where m is the magnetic moment of individual nanoparticles separated by a distance r.
For calculation of SLP values (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), a saturation magnetization value
of 340 mB was used for horse spleen ferritin. Anisotropy constant was obtained from reported values
(Garcı
´a-Prieto et al., 2016). Saturation magnetization and anisotropy constant for core-shell MNPs
were obtained from previous measurements (Zhang et al., 2015b). The permissible magnetic field
strength for each frequency points were calculated using the accepted limit of field attenuation (and
ensuing eddy current heating in tissues) (Atkinson et al., 1984; Chen et al., 2015). Power delivered
in W/g of particles is then given by:

Here, the magnetic susceptibility �0 follows Langevin’s equation and is a function of both the

 Molecular thermometry
To measure the local heating near the nanoparticle decorated cell surface, we used the fact that the
fluorescence lifetime as well as intensity of molecular fluorophores and fluorescent proteins decrease
with increasing temperature (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).
Fluorescent labeling of neutravidin and binding to MNPs
Neutravidin (31000, Thermo Scientific), dissolved in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 2 mg/ml (pH
7.34), was labeled with DyLightTM 550 NHS ester dye (62262, Life Technologies), or Alexa 647 dye
(A37573, Life technologies) by mixing Neutravidin stock solution with five times molar excess of the
fluorophore, and incubated in dark for 2 hr. Excess dye (molecular weight, under 3 kDa) was
removed using a Microcon 10 kDa centrifugal filter (EMD Millipore), 8000 r.c.f. Carboxylic groups on
surface of the PMA-MNP (1 mg/ml) were activated with 0.5 mg/ml of EDC [1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylami-
nopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride] (22980, Life technologies) and 1.4 mg/ml of Sulfo-NHS (N-
hydroxysulfosuccinimide) (24510, Life technologies). Activated MNPs were re-suspended in PBS, and
added dropwise to Neutravidin -Dylight 550 or -Alexa 647, in 10 times molar excess. After reacting
for two hours in the dark, the reaction was quenched with 10 mM Hydroxylamine buffer. Unbound
Neutravidin was removed by washing MNP in 300 kDa cut-off centrifuge filters (8000 r.c.f).
Fluorescence microscopy
Image acquisition and imaging conditions
Fluorescence intensities of GCaMP6f as a measure for Ca2+ levels, and DyLight 550 dye (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as molecular thermometer, were recorded using an inverted epifluores-
cence microscope (ZEISS AXIO OBSERVER A1.0m). Cells grown on 12 mm glass coverslip were
secured in a non-conducting chamber (ALA MS-512DWPW) and placed on the XY stage of the
microscope. A custom-built environmental incubation chamber enclosed the microscope. Tempera-
ture inside the chamber was set before the start of the experiment and kept stable at 33.0 ± 1.0˚C.
The fluorophores were excited using a HBO 200 mercury short arc lamp with appropriate filters. The
emission was collected with a 40x NA 0.75 Zeiss objective lens and recorded with an Andor NEO
sCMOS camera controlled by micromanager software (Edelstein et al., 2014). Continuous videos
were acquired with an exposure time of 100 ms at 2 � 2 binning, and saved as stack of uncom-
pressed. TIFF files. Uniblitz electronics VS14S2T0 shutter, driven by Uniblitz VCM-D1 driver was used
to synchronize excitation light illumination with camera acquisition times via micromanager software.
Microscopy in alternating magnetic field
The alternating magnetic fields induce eddy currents in the metallic microscope objective, heating it
up. The thermal expansion of the objective lens may cause optical distortions and focus changes. To
correct these in real time, we used a fast, customized piezoelectric autofocus system (Motion X Cor-
poration, 780 nm laser interferometer based). The autofocus laser beam was coupled in the optical
path of the microscope by a dichroic mirror, focused through the objective lens onto the coverslip
bottom and reflected back into the interferometer (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Therefore, it
not only detects and corrects changes in separation between coverslip and objective lens but also
internal optical changes.
Labeling cells with MNP
HEK 293 T cells
HEK cells growing on 12-mm glass coverslip, 50% confluent were co-transfected with plasmid
expressing Biotin acceptor arm AP-CFP-TM and plasmids BirA enzyme (p-DISPLAY) (Howarth et al.,
2005) (0.4 mg each). Following transfection, 5 uM of Biotin was fed to growing cells. 24 hr later the
coverslips were transferred to the imaging chamber (ALA MS-512DWPW) in 200 ml physiological salt
solution (PSS, ingredients in mM: CaCl2 2, NaCl 151, MgCl2 1, KCl 5, HEPES 10, and Glucose 10,
pH 7.3). MNP conjugated with neutravidin-DL550 (0.5 mg/ml) were added (2 ml). After 5 min, the
dish was perfused with PSS buffer to remove unbound particles.

 Neuronal culture
Nanoparticles were targeted to the neuronal cell membrane via biotinylated IgM antibody (433110,
Invitrogen). Neuronal cultures grown on 12 mm coverslip were loaded in imaging chamber (ALA sci-
entific) holding 200 ml of imaging buffer pH.7.34. Biotinylated antibody (2 mg/ml) was added, incu-
bated for 10 min, before being washed off by perfusing with HEPES buffer pH 7.3. Neutravidin
conjugated nanoparticles were then added at 10 mg/ml, and after 5 min the unbound nanoparticles
were washed off.
Molecular cloning and virus packing
Rat TRPV1(VR1) in pcDNA3 was a gift from Dr. Julius (UCSF). The lentivirus vector pLKO.1-EF1a-
TRPV1-IRES-DSRed was constructed as follows. A TRPV1 pcr fragment (5’ Sal I and 3’ Hpa I) was
subcloned into pLKO.1-EF1a-IRES-DSRed with a 5’ primer (5’-GCG TCG TCG GTC GAC GCC ACC
ATG GAA CAA CGG GCT AGC TTA GAC TC-3’) and a 3’ primer (5’-GCG TCG TCA AGC TTT TAT
TTC TCC CCT GGG ACC ATG GAA TC-3’). AAV5-hSyn-TRPV1 was constructed by generating a
TRPV1 pcr fragment (5’ Sal I and 3’ EcoR I) with 5’ primer (5’GCG TCG TCG GTC GAC GCC ACC
ATG GAA CAA CGG GCT AGC TTA GAC TC-3’) and 3’ primer (5’-GCG TCG TCG AAT TCT TAT
TTC TCC CCT GGG ACC ATG GAA TC-3’). The TRPV1 pcr product was cloned into Sal I and EcoR I
of pAAV-hSyn-HA-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry a gift from Bryan Roth (Addgene plasmid #50475). All con-
structs were sequence verified. The adeno-associated virus, AAV5-hSyn-TRPV1, was generated at
the Virus Vector Core at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The qPCR titer was
1.5 � 1012. Packing of the pLKO.1-EF1a-TRPV1-IRES-DSRed plasmid into lentivirus followed estab-
lished Protocols(Boyden et al., 2005).
In vitro experiments on neurons
Preparation of neurons
After transfection or nucleofection, the neuronal Cultures were placed in incubator for next 24–48 hr
to express the proteins. During this time, 1 mM TTX (Tetrodotoxin) was added to Neuronal culture to
minimize endogenous activity. For imaging, the TTX was washed out, and the neurons were placed
in Tyrode solution (NaCl 145, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, KCl 2.5, HEPES 10, Glucose 20; all in mM). The
imaging buffer also contained synaptic blockers DLAP-5 25 mM, NBQX 10 mM, and Gabazine 20 mM,
and the osmolality was adjusted to 310–315 mOsmole/L.
TRPV1 activation by heated buffer
Hippocampal Neuronal cells transiently expressing GCaMP6f and rat TRPV1 were investigated for
TRPV1 activation by heat. GCaMP6f acted as marker for nucleofected neurons and as genetically
encoded calcium indicator. TRPV1 activation by heat was achieved by perfusion of preheated imag-
ing buffer (HEPES 10 mM, NaCl 140 mM, CaCl2 2 mM, MgCl2 1 mM, KCl 4 mM, Glucose 10 mM).
Perfusion buffers were heated using an inline heater (SH-27B, Warner Instruments) with an inte-
grated temperature feedback (TC-324C). Bath temperature was monitored using Neoptix ReFlex
optical thermal probe. A custom built microscope enclosure chamber maintained the ambient tem-
perature 33 ± 1.0˚C. As a measure of temperature-driven TRPV1 activation, transient rise in intracel-
lular Ca2+ level was recorded from GCaMP6f fluorescence intensity changes (Figure 1F; Figure 1—
figure supplement 2B; Figure 3B).
Evoking and observing animal behavior
Animal surgeries for stereotaxic injection of virus or nanoparticles
Male BALB/c mice (3–4 week old, weighing 15–20 g) were obtained from Harlan Laboratories, and
housed in the live animal facility (LAF) under 12 hr light-dark cycle in accordance with approved ani-
mal protocols from the University at Buffalo SUNY Institutional Animal Care.
Mice were anesthetized by mixture of Ketamine and Xylazine (100 mg of Ketamine and 10 mg of
Xylazine per kilogram of body weight i.p.). Burpenorphine (0.1 mg per kg body weight, s.c.) was
administered as pre-operative pain medicine. Anesthetized mouse was mounted on Stereotaxic
frame (Stoelting) with the help of ear bars and tooth bar. The head was shaved and rubbed with
betadine and then ethanol. The skin was retracted and the periosteum was removed at the site. The
scalp was opened and hole was drilled in the skull, through which a 33-gauge needle fitted in 5 ml

 syringe was inserted into the motor cortex (MC) or striatum1 (St1), or St2, left or right (See supple-
mentary Table 1 for injection coordinates). Using that syringe and an automated syringe pump
(World Precision Instruments), 600 nl virus were infused at a rate of 2 nl/s. The injection needle was
raised 0.01 mm and kept in place for 5–10 min and slowly removed. The mouse scalp was sutured
and anti-inflammatory Carprofen (5 mg/ml) was given for 2 days’ post-surgery. All surgical proce-
dures were done under aseptic conditions. Animals were housed for 2 weeks to allow for viral
expression before any behavioral experiments were initiated.
Nanoparticle delivery at targeted site in brain
Equal moles of MNP conjugated with Neutravidin and biotinylated antibody were mixed at 1 mg/ml.
The mice were anesthetized using Xylazine and Ketamine, fixed in a stereotactic frame, the perios-
teum removed, and the pre-drilled hole from the virus injection 2 to 4 weeks earlier was identified.
Then, 600 nl of MNP-antibody was injected at the same site as the virus injection 2 weeks back, fol-
lowing exactly the same procedure (see above). The procedure was completed within 45 min and
the mice recovered within 1 hr, post anesthesia. Animals were placed in fresh cage and housed for
12 hr before initiating the experiment.
Recording animal behavior
For each session, the animals were placed in a circular observation area. Sessions were limited to 30
min, including 10 min habituation, and 15–20 min experiment, during which three or four 1-min long
AMF applications were given.
A consumer camera (Nikon D810) was used to record video (HD720, 60fps) of the mice before,
during and after the magnetic field stimulation. For the ‘freezing of gait’ response caused by stimula-
tion in the striatum, a different consumer camera (SONY DSC-H50) at 20fps was used. To minimize
influence of the light and shadows on the mouse’s behavior, the light levels were kept extremely low
(camera sensitivity set at ISO 12,800). The videos (12–18 min in length, 1.2–2.4 Gb, uncompressed)
were transferred to an iMac27’ computer. Red marks were made on the mice with common non-
toxic finger paints (Crayola) to aid motion tracking via computer vision.
Calcium data analysis
Fluorescence microscopy movies were recorded (Micromanager) as TIFF stacks and post processing
and ROI (region of interest) mean intensity data were extracted using FIJI (Fiji Is Just ImageJ). Rele-
vant ROIs were cropped from the video files and registration (using the Stack Registration plugin)
was done to eliminate any x-y shift in the images over the video frames. Afterwards, an intensity-
based threshold operation was done to convert non-cellular dimmer background pixels to NAN (Fig-
ure 3—figure supplement 1A). A polygonal ROI was then drawn to cover the cell body. The mean
intensity data (bit depth) of all the pixels within that ROI was saved with respective frame numbers.
The intensity versus time data was then exported to IgorPro, which was used for further analysis.
Intensity normalization
After importing the mean ROI intensity data as a wave in Igor Pro, constant dark noise values were
subtracted from all points in the wave. The dark noise is the mean signal recorded by the camera
under no illumination conditions. All experiments were done in the same dark room and the dark
noise value deviated little from experiment to experiment and is mostly dependent of the camera
exposure times. After, the dark noise cancellation, a further baseline subtraction was done for bleach
correction, if substantial bleaching-based decay in baseline was observed. For this, the baseline was

Single spike estimation
The intensity change of GCaMP6f makes it sensitive enough for single action potential detection,
but its temporal resolution is not high enough to produce temporally isolated spikes corresponding
to each firing in an AP train (Chen et al., 2013). To extract action potential events from a GCaMP6f
fluorescence signal (Ca2+ peaks), we first isolated all peaks from the intensity normalized data corre-
sponding to each neuron with a mean maximum of about 5% (of the baseline). The peaks were then
averaged and a mean peak profile was created (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C). The average
peak wave was then interpolated linearly to increase the temporal resolution to 100 Hz.
AP train reconstruction
A null wave of time length equal to that of the original data, but of 100 Hz frequency (in contrast to
10 Hz, for the original data) was created. The null wave was then converted to a binary wave, with 1
s at the location of estimated AP spikes (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E; black bars). The esti-
mated single spike wave was then convolved with the binary wave. An overlay of the normalized
data and its corresponding convolution-based reconstruction is shown in Figure 3—figure supple-
ment 1D,E. A histogram of the residue of the original and the reconstructed waves was fitted to a
Gaussian function. The locations of the 1 s in the binary wave were dynamically adjusted to obtain
an overall sigma of less than 2%. The binary wave obtained after optimization gave the temporal
function of AP events for each recording.
Behavioral analysis of freely moving mice
Motion tracking
For all motor behavior analysis, the position of the red neck marker was recorded automatically
using the free video analysis and modeling tool TRACKER built by Douglas Brown on the Open
Source Physics Java framework. For the active motor responses, every second frame was analyzed,
resulting in 30 position measurements per second. The coordinates produced by the tracker were
transferred to IgorPro (Wavemetrics) for further analysis and graphing. For motion tracking of the
‘freezing of gait’ response, the position of each paw was tracked every 1.2 s and the speed of the
mouse was calculated as the absolute value of the linear speed averaged over 3 s. For other record-
ings involving rapid mouse movements, linear speed and an angular speed are reported as an aver-
age over 500 ms. To visualize the spatial motion XY-plots of the motion in selected time windows
were generated directly from the raw XY coordinates. To visualize the temporal flow, we also plot
the XY-coordinates as function of time.
Video editing for presentation
Videos chosen for publication were edited using VSDC video editor software (Flash-Integro) and
Lightworks. Raw videos were compressed using H.264 encoder and downsampled to 15 fps and
sped up 3X for fast download and observation. The red marks on the neck were applied to aid
motion tracking. Field application periods are indicated on the bottom right, while the MNP injec-
tion sites in the brain are indicated on the bottom left.
Histology
Frozen coronal Rostral to caudal brain sections were prepared following standard protocols. The 75-
mm-thick slices were stained for subsequent laser confocal imaging.
Soma and dendrites of neurons were marked using a rabbit anti-microtubules-associated- protein
(MAP2) antibody (ab32454, Abcam)(24 hr, 1:500), in conjunction with anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 488
(ab150077, Abcam)(1 hr).
MNPs coated with PMA were conjugated with Neutravidin, tagged with ATTO 488. To boost the
fluorescence signal, some brain slices were incubated with Biotin-PEG, tagged with Alexa 647 dye
(24 hr, 1:500).

ces were incubated with anti-TRPV1 antibody (ab31895, Abcam), which we directly conjugated with
Alexa 647.
