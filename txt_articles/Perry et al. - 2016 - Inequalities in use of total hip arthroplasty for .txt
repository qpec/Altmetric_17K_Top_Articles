Inequalities in use of total hip arthroplasty for hip fracture: 
population based study
Daniel C Perry,1 David Metcalfe,2 Xavier L Griffin,3 Matthew L Costa3 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To determine whether the use of total hip arthroplasty 
(THA) among individuals with a displaced 
intracapsular fracture of the femoral neck is based on 
national guidelines or if there are systematic 
inequalities.
Design
Observational cohort study using the National Hip 
Fracture Database (NHFD).
setting
All hospitals that treat adults with hip fractures in 
England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
PartiCiPants
Patients within the national database (all aged ≥60) 
who received operative treatment for a non-
pathological displaced intracapsular hip fracture 
from 1 July 2011 to 31 April 2015.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Provision of THA to patients considered eligible under 
criteria published by the National Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE).
results
114 119 patients with hip fracture were included, 11 683 
(10.2%) of whom underwent THA. Of those who 
satisfied the NICE criteria, 32% (6780) received a THA. 
Of patients who underwent THA, 42% (4903) did not 
satisfy the NICE criteria. A recursive partitioning 
algorithm found that the NICE eligibility criteria did 
not optimally explain which patients underwent THA. 
A model with superior explanatory power drew 
distinctions that are not supported by NICE, which 
were an age cut off at 76 and a different ambulation cut 
off. Among patients who satisfied the NICE eligibility, 
the use of THA was less likely with higher age (odds 
ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 0.88), 
worsening abbreviated mental test scores (0.49 (0.41 
to 0.58) for normal cognition v borderline cognitive 
impairment)), worsening American Society of 
Anesthesiologists score (0.74, 0.66 to 0.84), male sex 
(0.85, 0.77 to 0.93), worsening ambulatory status 
(0.32, 0.28 to 0.35 for walking with a stick v 
independent ambulation), and fifths of worsening 
socioeconomic area deprivation (0.76 (0.66 to 0.88) 
for least v most deprived fifth). Patients receiving 
treatment during the working week were more likely to 
receive THA than at the weekend (0.90, 0.83 to 0.98).
COnClusiOns
There are wide disparities in the use of THA among 
individuals with hip fractures, and compliance with 
NICE guidance is poor. Patients with higher levels of 
socioeconomic deprivation and those who require 
surgery at the weekend were less likely to receive THA. 
Inconsistent compliance with NICE recommendations 
means that the optimal treatment for older adults with 
hip fractures can depend on where and when they 
present to hospital.
Introduction
There are over 70 000 hip fractures in the United King-
dom every year, with a combined health and social cost 
of £2bn (€2.5bn, $2.8bn).1  Demographic projections 
estimate that the annual incidence will increase to over 
100 000 by 2020.2  Mortality is high, with 8.5% of 
patients dying within 30 days after hip fracture.3
Several initiatives have been credited with improving 
outcomes in the UK.3  In 2004 the British Orthopaedic 
Association (BOA) and the British Geriatrics Society 
(BGS) established the National Hip Fracture Database 
(NHFD), with the aim of improving outcomes of hip 
fracture through continuous national clinical audit.4 
 
The national database was supported by combined 
BOA/BGS clinical guidance5  and later by the best prac-
tice tariff for hip fracture, which rewards NHS organisa-
tions for meeting defined quality standards, including 
surgery within 36 hours after arrival at hospital.6  These 
initiatives have been associated with improved out-
comes, including a fall in 30 day mortality from 10.9% 
in 2007 to 8.5% in 2011.3
Displaced intracapsular hip fractures are at high risk 
of painful non-union and so the recommended treat-
ment is either hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty 
(THA).7-9 In hemiarthroplasty, the femoral head is 
replaced; in THA, both the femoral head and acetabu-
lum are replaced. Although the risk-benefit profiles vary 
between these two operations, it has been shown that 
patients who undergo THA have better function and less 
need for revision surgery.7-11 In June 2011, the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recom-
mended that THA should be offered to patients with a 
displaced intracapsular hip fracture who are “(a) able to 
walk independently out of doors with no more than the

use of a stick (b) not cognitively impaired and (c) medi-
cally fit for anaesthesia and the procedure.”8 The provi-
sion of THA is not explicitly included as a quality 
indicator within the NHFD and so the extent to which 
surgeons comply with this guideline is unknown.
From clinical experience, we hypothesised that there 
were inequalities in use of THA between hospitals. We 
identified whether the use of THA is based on factors 
that are consistent with national recommendations or if 
systematic inequalities exist with regards to the use of 
THA for hip fracture.
Methods
We carried out an observational study using data col-
lected by the NHFD national clinical audit project. The 
study protocol was approved by the Healthcare Quality 
Improvement Partnership (HQIP) before data release, 
but research ethics committee approval was not sought 
for secondary analysis of administrative data in line 
with Governance Arrangements for Research Ethics 
Committee (GAfREC) guidelines.12
Data source
The NHFD is commissioned by the Healthcare Quality 
Improvement Partnership and managed by the Royal 
College of Physicians as part of the Falls and Fragility 
Fracture Audit Programme (FFFAP). It captures over 
95% of hip fractures treated in England, Wales, Northern 
Ireland, and the Channel Islands. Data include patients’ 
characteristics, fracture pattern, surgical interventions, 
and outcomes. These details are typically collected by 
specialist nurses within each hospital who provide con-
tinuity of care to patients with hip fractures and manage 
submissions to the NHFD. Data from patients aged 
under 60 are not captured within the database.
inclusion criteria
This study included all patients aged ≥60 who pre-
sented to hospital from 1 July 2011 to 31 April 2015 with 
a displaced intracapsular hip fracture. We chose 1 July 
2011 as one month after publication of NICE Clinical 
Guideline 124.8 Patients were excluded if their fracture 
was coded as “pathological” as this could represent a 
heterogeneous group that includes patients with dis-
seminated cancer.
variables and outcomes
Data cleaning involved several steps. Two patients had 
ages recorded as >115 (both >1000), which we recoded 
to exclude this variable. In 27 (0.01%) cases, the score of 
the abbreviated mental test (AMTS) was not recorded as 
an integer and so scores were rounded to the nearest 
integer. On 1 April 2014 the NHFD data collection tool 
was updated to record mobility differently within the 
revised database. Earlier data were therefore mapped 
onto the new version by using the algorithm shown in 
appendix 1. In the event of hospital trust reconfigura-
tion (closure/merger), we used the hospital code at the 
time of data entry. As a consequence, some hospitals 
contributed data for only a few months before reconfig-
uration.
Variables extracted from the NHFD were age (whole 
years), sex, lower layer super output area (LSOA), date 
of admission, treating hospital, pre-morbid mobility, 
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classifica-
tion score for physical status, and score on the abbrevi-
ated mental test. The physical status score ranges 
between 1 (healthy patient) and 5 (moribund patient not 
expected to survive for 24 hours with or without sur-
gery). The abbreviated mental test is a test of 10 ques-
tions (such as “what is your age?”), which gives a score 
from 0 (zero answers correct) to 10 (all correct).
Deprivation scores for patients living in England were 
determined with the index of multiple deprivation, 
2007
. These scores reflect deprivation related to income, 
health and disability, employment, barriers to housing 
and services, living environment, education, and 
crime.13 Scores were generated from lower layer super 
output areas, which were then categorised into fifths of 
deprivation based on the population of the UK.
Day of the week was determined from the date of 
admission. In the UK, surgery for hip fracture usually 
takes place on the next available trauma operating list, 
which for most patients in the NHFD (≥65%) is the day 
after admission. “Weekend” surgery was therefore iden-
tified by admission on a Friday or Saturday.
Hospital case volume was analysed by 10ths and 
defined by the number of people with displaced intra-
capsular fracture admitted to each centre over the study 
period.
Date of surgery was analysed as seven periods of six 
months (1 July 2011 to 31 December 2015) and one period 
of four months (1 Jan 2015 to 31 April 2015).
statistical analysis
We determined compliance with guidelines with a 
decision tree ordered to mirror the NICE recommenda-
tions—that is, based on mobility (mobile outdoors 
with or without the use of a stick), cognition (defined 
as mental test score ≥8), and fitness for anaesthesia 
(defined as physical status score 1 or 2). Although the 
cut offs used for these two scores are not expressly 
published as part of the guideline, they have been 
used by NICE to monitor compliance with the guide-
line.14  A mental test score <8 has previously been 
shown to identify cognitive impairment15  and has 
been adopted as a threshold by the Royal College of 
Physicians of London.16 We determined the extent to 
which the NICE algorithm explained practice—that is, 
those individuals correctly classified as a percentage 
of the total.
We used recursive partitioning to determine the opti-
mal decision tree that explains current practice—that 
is, to illustrate how the guidelines are being interpreted. 
Recursive partitioning is a statistical technique for mul-
tivariable analysis that models how variables are best 
organised to predict a given outcome (such as THA). 
Decision trees are built by identifying a variable that 
best splits the data into two groups. The partitioning 
process defines a cut off (split) for continuous or ordinal 
variables to enable the decision tree to correctly classify 
the maximum members of the population. Categorical

variables are similarly grouped to build a tree with the 
least error. This process is then applied separately to 
each subgroup and continues recursively until either a 
maximum number of steps are reached or no further 
improvement is possible.17
We undertook recursive partitioning using the 
“rpart” function in R. The tree was built with 10-fold 
cross validation and a negative complexity parameter to 
ensure that the maximum tree was built. Predictors 
included in the model were age, sex, mobility, cognition 
(AMTS), physical status (ASA score), fifth of index of 
multiple deprivation, and day of the week of admission. 
The tree was pruned with the complexity (“cp”) func-
tion of the smallest tree within one standard error of the 
best functioning tree—that is, the tree with the smallest 
xerror, which was confirmed graphically. We also used 
a pragmatic approach to consider the tree complexity 
and efficiency related to clinical practice.
Individuals who fulfilled the NICE criteria were fur-
ther analysed to explore factors associated with under-
going THA. We constructed a recursive partitioning 
decision tree to differentiate between THA and no THA 
in this subgroup. The treating hospital was included as 
a factor variable, which allowed the partitioning algo-
rithm to select optimal cut off points for best fit within 
the model.
We constructed a mixed effects logistic regression 
model to explore factors associated with the use of THA 
among patients who fulfilled the NICE criteria. Age, sex, 
date of surgery, cognition, and physical status were 
included as continuous predictors; and fifth of index of 
multiple deprivation and weekend surgery as categori-
cal predictors. Weekend admission was then substi-
tuted for day of the week to explore this predictor 
further in a second analysis. Hospital case volume was 
included as a centre level fixed effect and the unique 
hospital identifier as a centre level random effect. We 
applied the same analysis to patients who did not fulfil 
the NICE criteria for THA to determine factors predictive 
of receiving a THA in this group.
Statistical analyses were performed with R and Stata 
version14.0. P<0.05 was adopted as the threshold for 
significance.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
In the 46 month period between 1 July 2011 and 31 April 
2015, the NHFD recorded 248 013 patients with hip frac-
ture. Of these, 114 119 satisfied the study criteria with a 
non-pathological displaced intracapsular hip fracture. 
Though 21 193 patients satisfied the NICE criteria to 
receive a THA (fig 1), only 11 683 within the NHFD under-
went THA. Among these 11 683 patients, 4903 did not 
fulfil the NICE criteria.
The recursive partitioning algorithm identified 10 ter-
minal nodes (nine splits) as the most predictive model, 
although this offered little improvement over five termi-
nal nodes (four splits) (fig 2 ). The variable with the 
greatest importance was patient age, with a cut off age 
of 77 defining the initial split (fig 3). The mobility split 
occurred between patients who ambulate inde-
pendently and those who required the use of a stick. 
The other important predictive variables were those rec-
ommended by NICE, with splits occurring as predicted 
at ASA ≥3 for physical status and AMTS ≥8 for cogni-
tion. With the decision tree, the explained practice 
across the dataset improved from 82.7% (NICE guide-
lines) to 90.4% (recursive model).
Among the 21 193 patients fulfilling the NICE eligibil-
ity criteria, the recursive partitioning algorithm identi-
fied 20 terminal nodes (19 splits) to be the most efficient, 
although after three splits (four terminal nodes), the 
complexity of the tree increased markedly with little 
associated gain in efficiency (fig 4 ). Again age was 
the most significant predictor, with aged 79 identifying

the splitting point (fig 5 ). For patients aged ≥79, the 
treating hospital was the next most important predictor 
(see appendix 2 for further details), followed by mobil-
ity (with or without the use of a stick). Hospital varia-
tion among individuals fulfilling the NICE guidelines 
was considerable (fig 6). Of the variation in practice, 
77% could be explained using this recursive partition-
ing algorithm, compared with 32% by NICE guidelines 
alone.
Date of surgery showed that there was a progressive 
increase in the provision of THA for eligible individuals 
over the study period (table 1).
The logistic regression model (table 2) showed that 
10ths of hospital volume did not affect THA (odds ratio 
1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.08). Increasing 
age (0.88, 0.87 to 0.88), poorer cognition (AMTS) (0.49 
(0.41 to 0.58) for 1.0 (ref) v borderline for cognitive 
impairment), and worsening physical status (ASA 
score) (0.74, 0.66 to 0.84), however, were associated 
with fewer procedures, as was male sex (0.85, 0.77 to 
0.93). Admissions for surgery during the working week 
had the highest odds for receipt of THA (weekend 
admission 0.90, 0.83 to 0.98). There was a stepwise 
decrease in the odds of receiving THA with worsening 
area deprivation, such that the most deprived fifth had 
the fewest procedures (0.76, 0.66 to 0.88).
We conducted a further analysis among individuals 
with a non-pathological displaced intracapsular frac-
ture who did not fulfil the NICE eligibility criteria for 
THA (n=92 926). Of these patients, 4903 underwent the 
procedure. With the same regression model, similar 
inequalities emerged. The receipt of THA outside the 
recommendations of NICE was least common among 
those with worse socioeconomic deprivation (odds 
ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.77), with a 
stepwise decrease from the most deprived fifth. Simi-
larly, patients were less likely to receive THA outside the 
NICE guidelines when they were admitted at the week-
end (0.89 (0.81 to 0.98) for all weekend, 0.87 (0.75 to 
1.01) for Friday, 0.94 (0.81 to 1.09) for Saturday, 0.98 
(0.84 to 1.15) for Sunday, 1.03 (0.89 to 1.19) for Monday, 
1.01 (0.88 to 1.17) for Tuesday, 1.0 (reference) for Wednes-
day, and 1.01 (0.88 to 1.17) for Thursday.
discussion
This observational study used a large national audit 
dataset and has shown that there is unexplained varia-
tion in the use of THA after a hip fracture. This surgery 
was influenced by several characteristics of patients, 
including age, sex, cognition (AMTS), physical status 
(ASA score), socioeconomic status, and mobility before 
the fracture. Other key determinants were the treating 
hospital and the day of the week of admission. The use 
of THA among eligible patients increased over the study 
period but remains both low and variable.
Compliance with niCe recommendations
NICE was established in 1999 to promote evidence 
based treatments and reduce unexplained variation in 
care across the NHS, the so called “postcode lottery.”18 
 
In June 2011, NICE recommended that THA should be 
offered to patients with a displaced intracapsular hip 
fracture who can walk independently outdoors (with no 
more than a single mobility aid), are cognitively intact, 
and are medically fit to undergo the operation. This 
guideline is consistent with a developing evidence 
base, which suggests that THA leads to better func-
tional outcomes than hemiarthroplasty after hip frac-
ture,7-11 although a large scale intervention study is 
needed and is currently underway.19 Despite the NICE 
guideline, we found that variation in the use of THA 
persists across the NHS because of poor compliance 
with the guidelines. There was substantial variation in 
compliance (0.1-60%) between hospitals. As patient 
level predictors were unable to account for this varia-
tion, it is likely to reflect systematic differences in prac-
tice between centres.
The optimal recursive partitioning model suggested 
that surgeons might consider factors that could be rele-
vant even if not strictly included within the NICE guide-
lines. For example, older patients were less likely to 
undergo THA, as were those who mobilised using a 
stick compared with those mobilising independently 
without aids. Although there is strong evidence that 
some patients with hip fracture benefit from THA,7-11 its

precise indications are not well defined. Our model 
offers a glimpse into the collective judgment of ortho-
paedic surgeons and could be used to help inform the 
development of future NICE guidelines in the absence 
of higher level evidence. It is nevertheless concerning 
that deprivation was inversely associated with the use 
of THA. This observation persisted among patients who 
received a THA but did not meet the NICE guidelines, 
with deprived individuals least likely to inappropriately 
receive a THA. This is particularly important because 
NHS treatment is universally provided irrespective of 
ability to pay and “free at the point of use.” Challenging 
health inequalities is an ambition of initiatives aimed at 
increasing access to healthcare in other countries.20  It is 
therefore important to understand reasons for socioeco-
nomic inequalities that persist in public healthcare sys-
tems. There are many potential explanations for this 
observation, including patients’ preferences and con-
founding factors. It is also possible, however, that heu-
ristic judgments about which patients are sufficiently 
“independent” to benefit from THA could be influenced 
by implicit surgeon bias. Social class biases have been 
shown to influence treatment decisions across a range 
of settings21-23 and could raise a barrier for patients who 
are otherwise eligible to undergo THA. This inverse 
association risks exacerbating health inequalities and 
is a further reason to promote clear, evidence based, 
national guidelines.
barriers to increased provision of tHa 
One potential obstacle to delivering THA for all eligible 
patients with hip fracture is the availability of experi-
enced hip surgeons. It is widely accepted that patients 
undergoing elective THA by a low volume surgeon have 
greater risks of dislocation, need for revision surgery, 
postoperative complications, and death.24-28 For this 
reason, many orthopaedic surgeons do not perform 
THA for hip fracture if this operation is not part of their 
routine elective practice. The limited availability of suit-
ably experienced hip surgeons might account for the 
reduced use of this procedure observed at weekends. 
This finding is important in the context of recent pro-
posals to introduce seven day services across the NHS.29 
 
Although this discussion is principally framed around 
increased weekend mortality,30 
31  timely access to THA 
for fracture might also need to be examined. Regionali-
sation of hip fracture services seems a plausible means 
of ensuring equal access to THA, by enabling specialist 
hip surgeons to support such a service every day. Dedi-
cated hip fracture centres have already been success-
fully piloted in Germany.32 33 The potential benefits of 
regionalisation, however, would need to be weighed 
against competing considerations such as the desire of 
older adults to be treated close to their homes.
strengths and limitations of study
The main strength of this study was its use of a dataset 
that captures almost every patient with hip fracture 
(>95%) treated in England, Wales, and Northern Ire-
land. There were variables that aligned closely with the 
NICE eligibility criteria, which permitted the recom-
mended treatment algorithm to be mapped over the 
administrative data recorded within the NHFD.
The principal limitation was that the NHFD does not 
record individual patient comorbidities and so it was 
not possible to determine if specific comorbid diseases 
were associated with differences in the use of THA. 
Some of the variables in our analysis (such as age and 
deprivation) could simply represent a tendency towards 
a greater burden of comorbidity. The American Society 
of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, however, has been 
shown to have equivalent or even greater predictive 
value for mortality and complications than standard

comorbidity measures, such as the Charlson comorbid-
ity index).34-36 It is unlikely that patients assigned a 
score ≤2 (2=“mild systemic disease”) were medically 
unfit to undergo THA. The NHFD also does not include 
sufficient detail to understand clinical decision making 
at the individual patient level. For example, it is possi-
ble that THA was discussed with some patients and 
hemiarthroplasty was chosen after a balanced discus-
sion of risk and benefit. The variation between  
hospitals 
in compliance with NICE guidelines, however, suggests 
that there is likely to be systematic differences with pro-
vision of THA.
Conclusion
Compliance with the NICE guidance on THA for hip 
fracture seems poor, with many apparently eligible 
patients not undergoing the procedure. There continues 
to be substantial variation in practice between hospi-
tals, which is not readily explained by differences at the 
patient level. The limited use of THA among patients 
from deprived areas, the inappropriately high use 
among patients from more affluent areas, and inequali-
ties in the provision of treatment at the weekend are 
particular concerns. Despite clear national guidelines, 
it seems most likely that there are systematic differ-
ences with use of THA in hip fractures within this data-
set. There have been substantial improvements in all of 
the quality indicators measured by the NHFD since its 
creation in 2004.3 The NHFD should consider reporting 
data on THA provision at the hospital level to help 
achieve greater consistency across the NHS.
