 dosing of one or more anti-diabetic drugs. Hypoglycemia and weight are common side effects of 
therapy, and sustained disease remission is not obtainable with non-surgical approaches. Based on 
the potent glucose-lowering response elicited by activation of brain fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 
receptors2–4, we explored the anti-diabetic efficacy of centrally administered FGF1, which, unlike 
other FGF peptides, activates all FGF receptor subtypes5. We report that a single 
intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of FGF1 at a dose one-tenth of that needed for systemic 
anti-diabetic efficacy induces sustained diabetes remission in both mouse and rat models of T2D. 
This anti-diabetic effect is not secondary to weight loss, does not increase the risk of 
hypoglycemia, and involves a novel and incompletely understood mechanism for increasing 
glucose clearance from the bloodstream. We conclude that the brain has the inherent potential to 
induce diabetes remission and that brain FGF receptors are potential pharmacological targets for 
achieving this goal.

Growing evidence points to the brain as a potential target for the treatment of T2D6,7. In 
rodent models of T2D, hyperglycemia can be ameliorated transiently by either systemic or 
i.c.v. administration of FGF192–4,8 or FGF219. Unlike these peptide hormones, which bind 
to and activate a limited subset of FGF receptors (FGFR) via an interaction that requires the 
co-receptor β-Klotho, the tissue growth factor FGF1 binds to and activates all known FGFR 
isoforms without the need for β-Klotho5. Moreover, glucose lowering elicited by systemic 
administration of FGF1 is of longer duration (up to 42 h)10 than is elicited by either FGF192 
or FGF219. In the brain, FGF1 is synthesized by neurons, astrocytes, and ependymal 
cells11,12, and central FGF1 administration can enhance learning and memory12, reduce food 
intake13, and limit damage associated with ischemic stroke or neurodegenerative 
disease14,15. In addition, a physiological role for FGF1 in glucose homeostasis is implied by 
the development of diabetes in mice lacking FGF1 challenged with a high fat diet16.
We therefore hypothesized that like FGF19 and FGF21, FGF1 action in the brain promotes 
glucose lowering in rodent models of T2D and, based on its relatively prolonged anti-
diabetic action following systemic administration, that glucose lowering induced by i.c.v. 
FGF1 administration would be long-lived relative to other FGF peptides. To test this 
hypothesis, we monitored blood glucose levels following a single injection of recombinant 
mouse FGF1 (mFGF1) into the lateral ventricle of diabetic ob/ob mice at a dose (3 μg) one-
tenth that needed for systemic anti-diabetic efficacy10. As predicted, we observed a ~25% 
decline of fasting blood glucose levels 6 h after i.c.v. injection of mFGF1 (Fig. 1a). 
Although modest, this effect cannot be explained by either reduced food intake (since food 
was not available during this time) or by leakage from the brain to the periphery, since 
subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of the same dose of FGF1 was without effect (Fig. 1b).
To assess the duration of this glucose-lowering effect, we monitored both fasting and ad-
libitum (ad-lib) fed blood glucose levels over time following a single i.c.v. injection of 
mFGF1. We found that blood glucose levels were fully normalized 7 d later (Fig. 1c,d) and

 remained within the normal range (<200 mg/dL) for the next 17 weeks (having concluded 
that sustained diabetes remission had been achieved, the study was terminated after a total 
duration of 18 weeks) (Fig. 1c,d). This sustained glucose-lowering effect of i.c.v. FGF1 was 
not associated with changes of either plasma insulin or glucagon levels (Supplementary Fig. 
1a).
Although food intake and body weight were also reduced by i.c.v. mFGF1 in these mice, the 
effect was transient such that the pronounced improvement of glycemia persisted for months 
after food intake, body weight and fat mass had returned to normal (Fig. 1e). This finding 
suggests, but does not establish, that diabetes remission induced by central FGF1 injection is 
weight loss-independent. To more directly test this hypothesis, two additional groups of 
ob/ob mice were monitored after receiving a single i.c.v. injection of saline vehicle (Veh). 
One of these groups was allowed to feed ad-lib while the other was pair-fed to the amount of 
food consumed by ob/ob mice receiving i.c.v. FGF1. Although blood glucose values 
declined in the pair-fed group relative to ad-lib-fed animals, the effect was both modest and 
transient and did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1f). Therefore, sustained diabetes 
remission induced by the central action of FGF1 cannot be explained by reduced food intake 
or body weight.
To assess the reproducibility of these findings, we subjected three additional groups of 
diabetic ob/ob mice to a single i.c.v. injection of Veh, recombinant human FGF1 (hFGF1), or 
mFGF1. Although the onset of glucose lowering in response to hFGF1 was delayed by 24 h, 
sustained diabetes remission was nevertheless observed following a single i.c.v. injection of 
either peptide (Fig. 2a). In addition, prolonged glucose lowering accompanied by a transient 
reduction of food intake and body weight was observed irrespective of whether mFGF1 (3 
μg) was injected into the lateral (Fig. 1d,e) or the 3rd ventricle (Supplementary Fig. 1b). 
Hypoglycemia was not elicited by i.c.v. FGF1 in either ob/ob mice (Fig. 2a) or in lean, wild-
type (WT) controls, whether fed standard chow (Fig. 2b) or a high-fat diet (HFD) (Fig. 2c). 
Although this ability to ameliorate hyperglycemia without risk of hypoglycemia is shared by 
both systemic administration of a ~10 fold higher dose of mFGF1 (0.5 mg/kg body weight 
s.c.; Fig. 2d) and central administration of the same dose of FGF19 (3 μg i.c.v.; Fig. 2e), 
neither intervention elicits persistent glucose lowering. Sustained diabetes remission induced 
by the central action of FGF1, therefore, involves mechanisms distinct from those engaged 
by either systemic FGF1 or i.c.v. FGF19 when administered at doses with comparable short-
term glucose-lowering efficacy.
Based on evidence that i.c.v. FGF1 reduces blood glucose levels and suppresses the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-axis (HPA) in rats with severe diabetic ketoacidosis17, we measured 
plasma corticosterone levels at a fixed time of day (in mid-light cycle, between 1400–1600 
h, following a 6 h fast), 6 h after administration of either FGF1 (3 μg) or Veh, into either the 
lateral ventricle or the 3rd ventricle of ob/ob mice. Plasma corticosterone levels were not 
reduced by FGF1 (irrespective of the route of i.c.v. delivery; Supplementary Fig. 2a,b) in 
these mice, nor was such an effect observed in ob/ob mice with sustained FGF1-induced 
diabetes remission (again, measured during mid-light cycle following a 6 h fast), despite 
their much lower blood glucose levels (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Diabetes remission induced 
by i.c.v. FGF1, therefore, cannot be attributed to HPA axis suppression.

 To investigate whether sustained diabetes remission induced by centrally administered FGF1 
in ob/ob mice occurs in other mouse models of T2D, we repeated the experiment in both 
db/db mice (Fig. 2f). We also employed the combination of diet-induced obesity (DIO) with 
a low dose of the β-cell toxin streptozotocin (DIO-LD STZ) in wild-type mice to model the 
combination of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction of human T2D (Fig. 2g). Our 
finding that sustained glucose lowering was induced by i.c.v. mFGF1 in each of these mouse 
models demonstrates that remission of T2D induced by the central action of FGF1 is not 
limited to ob/ob mice. As expected, both food intake and body weight were also reduced 
following i.c.v. FGF1 in these mouse models (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b), but as in ob/ob 
mice (Supplementary Fig. 3c), these effects were transient such that pronounced glucose 
lowering persisted well after body weight had returned to control values (Fig. 2f,g).
To determine if FGF1-induced diabetes remission is achievable in a different species, we 
administered either the same dose (3 μg i.c.v.) of recombinant rat FGF1 (rFGF1) or Veh to 
adult male Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats. Consistent with our findings in mice, diabetes 
remission lasting >4 weeks was induced by a single i.c.v. injection of rFGF1 in these 
animals and once again, hypoglycemia was not observed (Fig. 2h), although food intake and 
body weight were reduced, as expected (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Since pronounced glucose 
lowering in ZDF rats persisted well after food intake, body weight, and fat mass had 
returned to control values (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 3d), we conclude that as in 
diabetic mice, i.c.v. FGF1 induces weight loss-independent diabetes remission in a rat model 
of T2D.
To investigate the peripheral mechanisms underlying diabetes remission induced by i.c.v. 
FGF1, we first measured the rate of plasma glucose clearance in the basal state. We found 
that despite a ~39% reduction of fasting blood glucose values 1 week following i.c.v. 
injection of FGF1 (3 μg) in ob/ob mice (Fig. 3a), there was no difference in the basal 
glucose turnover rate (GTR; which at steady-state equals the rates of both glucose 
production and glucose disposal) (Fig. 3b). Implied in this observation is an increased 
peripheral glucose clearance rate (a measure of the efficiency of glucose removal from the 
circulation),18 since the rate of glucose disposal increases as a function of its plasma level. 
Accordingly, the basal glucose clearance rate was increased two-fold in mice receiving i.c.v. 
mFGF1 compared to vehicle (Fig. 3b).
To determine whether this increase of basal glucose clearance resulted from an increase of 
insulin sensitivity (measured as the insulin sensitivity index, SI), insulin secretion (measured 
as the acute insulin response to glucose, AIRg) or insulin-independent glucose disposal 
(measured as glucose effectiveness, Sg), we performed a frequently sampled intravenous 
glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) followed by minimal model analysis of blood glucose and 
plasma insulin data (a method validated in humans,19 primates,20 dogs21 and rodents2,22,23) 
in the same cohort of ob/ob mice (Fig. 3a). Although a trend towards improved glucose 
tolerance was observed in mice receiving prior i.c.v. mFGF1 injection, the effect was not 
statistically significant after correcting for the difference in basal glucose levels (ΔAUC; Fig. 
3a). A tendency for increased glucose-induced insulin secretion (AIRg) was also observed in 
the group receiving i.c.v. FGF1, but this effect did not achieve statistical significance, nor 
did increases of either SI or SG (Fig. 3a,c). Sustained diabetes remission induced by the

 central action of FGF1, therefore, involves a novel mechanism characterized by increased 
peripheral glucose clearance in the basal state with no change of basal hepatic glucose 
production, glucose tolerance, or in any of the three determinants of glucose tolerance (SI, 
AIRg, and Sg).
Relative to i.c.v. Veh-treated controls, both hepatic glycogen content and hepatic expression 
of genes encoding the key glucoregulatory enzymes glucokinase (Gck), liver-type pyruvate 
kinase (Pklr) and glycogen synthase (Gys2) were increased in ob/ob mice 1 week following 
i.c.v. mFGF1 (Fig. 3d). Combined with an increase of basal plasma lactate levels (Fig. 3d) 
that is suggestive of increased intrahepatic glycolysis2,24,25, diabetes remission induced by 
i.c.v. FGF1 appears to involve increased hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) with subsequent 
increases of both glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. In contrast, the expression of hepatic 
gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) and glucose-6-phosphatase 
(G6pc) were not altered by i.c.v. mFGF1 (Fig. 3d), consistent with the absence of any effect 
on basal GTR.
To determine if tissues other than the liver contribute to the FGF1-mediated increase of basal 
glucose clearance, we collected tissues from ob/ob mice following continuous intravenous 
(i.v.) infusion of radiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose 1 week after a single i.c.v. injection of mFGF1 
(3 μg) or Veh. Mixed model analysis revealed that the rate of glucose clearance (Kg) into 
skeletal muscle, but not heart, adipose tissue or brain, was increased following i.c.v. FGF1 
(after adjusting for the four skeletal muscle types sampled; see Methods) (Fig. 3e). Thus, 
diabetes remission induced by i.c.v. FGF1 appears to involve increases of basal glucose 
clearance into both liver and skeletal muscle, but not other tissues. Combined with the lack 
of any change of uncoupling protein-1 (Ucp1) gene expression in brown adipose tissue 
(BAT) from ob/ob mice receiving i.c.v. mFGF1 (Supplementary Fig. 4a), these observations 
indicate that BAT thermogenesis is unlikely to contribute to diabetes remission induced by 
i.c.v. FGF1. Similarly, diabetes remission induced by i.c.v. FGF1 administration was not 
associated with reduced plasma levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, or non-esterified free 
fatty acids (NEFA) in either ob/ob or db/db mice (Supplementary Fig. 4b,c).
Unlike the lack of glycemic regulation characteristic of uncontrolled type 1 diabetes26, the 
pathogenesis of T2D appears to involve regulation of glycemia at an elevated level27. This 
distinction provides a useful context within which to consider our finding that although i.c.v. 
FGF1 worked well in both mouse and rat models of T2D with moderate hyperglycemia, it 
was ineffective in mice with more severe, uncontrolled hyperglycemia (blood glucose >300 
mg/dl). This observation applies not only to db/db mice and DIO WT mice receiving a high 
dose of STZ (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b), but also to ob/ob mice crossed onto the diabetogenic 
BTBR background (Supplementary Fig. 5c).
One potential explanation for this outcome is that FGF1-mediated glucose lowering requires 
an intact insulin signal; i.e., that intact basal insulin action is permissive for diabetes 
remission induced by central FGF1. To formally test this hypothesis, we administered the 
high-affinity insulin receptor (IR) antagonist S96128 to DIO WT mice as a continuous s.c. 
infusion at a dose (29 nmol/week) designed to achieve the moderately elevated blood 
glucose levels characteristic of FGF1-responsive ob/ob mice (on the C57Bl6J background;

 Fig. 1d). Although we observed the expected, transient reduction of food intake and body 
weight following i.c.v. mFGF1 in S961-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 5d), glucose 
lowering did not occur (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Thus, intact insulin signaling appears to be 
required for diabetes remission induced by the central action of FGF1.
In hepatocytes, the glucose-lowering action of insulin depends on inactivation of the 
transcription factor FoxO129, and in mice with deficient hepatic insulin signaling, increased 
FoxO1 signaling potently inhibits HGU30,31. These observations raise the possibility that 
activation of hepatic FoxO1 induced by insulin receptor blockade underlies the observed 
resistance to FGF1-mediated glucose lowering. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect 
of i.c.v. mFGF1 in mice with liver-specific deletion of both FoxO1 and insulin receptor 
(liver IR/FoxO1 double knockout, or LIRFKO, mice30) in which hyperglycemia was induced 
by systemic S961 administration. As expected, insulin receptor blockade induced by S961 
did not impair the ability of i.c.v. FGF1 to reduce food intake and body weight 
(Supplementary Fig. 6a,b), but hyperglycemia elicited by systemic IR blockade was not 
ameliorated by centrally administration of FGF1 in either LIRFKO mice or their controls 
(Supplementary Fig 6a,b). Resistance to FGF1-mediated glucose lowering conferred by IR 
blockade therefore involves mechanisms additional to hepatic FoxO1 activation.
As cells responsive to both glucose and FGF132,33, tanycytes lining the 3rd ventricle adjacent 
to the mediobasal hypothalamus have interesting potential as mediators of FGF1-induced 
diabetes remission. To determine if the response of these cells to FGF1 (which induces 
sustained diabetes remission) differs from that elicited by FGF19 (which does not induce 
diabetes remission), we used immunohistochemistry to detect c-Fos, a marker of cellular 
activation, 90 min following injection into the lateral ventricle of Veh, FGF1 or FGF19. 
Whereas i.c.v. FGF1 induced robust c-Fos expression in 3rd ventricular tanycytes, FGF19 
did not (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b), raising the possibility of a functional link between 
activation of 3rd ventricular tanycytes and diabetes remission induced by FGF1.
Hypothalamic expression of heat-shock protein 25 (the mouse homologue of human 
HSP27), a potent neuroprotectant molecule34, is highly responsive to FGF1 stimulation. 
Confirming a previous report13, we observed a marked increase of hypothalamic HSP25 
(Hspb1) mRNA 6 h following i.c.v. injection of mFGF1 (3 μg) in non-diabetic control mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 7c). To determine if 3rd ventricular tanycytes are among the cells in 
which HSP25 is induced by FGF1, we employed whole-mount immunostaining of the 3rd 
ventricular wall to detect expression of HSP25 24 h after a single i.c.v. injection of either 
mFGF1 or Veh. Coupled with confocal microscopy, this method provides an en-face 
perspective not only of ependyma and tanycytes lining the ventricular surface, but also of 
neurons and glia in hypothalamic parenchyma at a depth of up to 80 μm35. We found that 
i.c.v. FGF1 induced robust expression of HSP25 in both a discrete band of tanycytes (Fig. 
4a–c) in the posterior ventral aspect of the 3rd ventricular surface and in subependymal, 
stellate-shaped astrocytes (Fig. 4d) adjacent to the 3rd ventricle. In contrast, neuronal 
expression of HSP25 was not detected, nor was this protein detected in tanycytes or 
astrocytes in mice receiving i.c.v. Veh (Fig. 4e–g).

 To investigate whether i.c.v. FGF1 affects hypothalamic synaptic content, we quantified the 
level of synaptophysin36,37, a synaptic marker, in hypothalamic extracts obtained 1 week 
following a single i.c.v. injection of mFGF1 or Veh in ob/ob mice. Our finding of a 24% 
increase of hypothalamic synaptophysin content in FGF1-treated mice is suggestive of 
increased synaptic density in this brain area (Supplementary Fig. 7d).
Beyond certain bariatric surgical procedures, we are unaware of any intervention capable of 
inducing remission of T2D in humans or rodents. Here, we report that in multiple rodent 
models of T2D, a single i.c.v. dose of FGF1 restores blood glucose levels to the normal 
range in a manner that is sustained for weeks, is not associated with hypoglycemia, is not 
secondary to changes of energy balance or fat stores, and is apparently mediated by 
increased glucose clearance into both liver and skeletal muscle.
The liver’s enormous capacity for glucose uptake contributes substantially to glucose 
clearance following a meal38. Although rising concentrations of glucose in the hepatic portal 
vein are the primary stimulus driving increased HGU, signals emanating from the brain are 
also implicated38. In light of our evidence linking increased HGU to FGF1-mediated glucose 
lowering, we speculate that diabetes remission induced by i.c.v. FGF1 involves an action on 
neurocircuits that normally serve to enhance HGU following a meal. Increased glucose 
clearance into skeletal muscle also appears to contribute to FGF1-mediated diabetes 
remission, and each of these effects occurred in the absence of increases of either basal 
insulin levels or glucose-induced insulin secretion. Since measures of insulin secretion were 
made at a time when blood glucose levels were lower in FGF1- than in Veh-treated mice, 
however, it remains possible that an effect of central FGF1 to enhance insulin secretion was 
masked by the concurrent decrease of blood glucose levels. Combined with our finding that 
systemic insulin receptor blockade disrupts FGF1-mediated glucose lowering, additional 
study of insulin’s role in FGF1-mediated diabetes remission is needed.
Although systemic FGF1 administration also has anti-diabetic effects, it does not induce 
sustained diabetes remission10. This observation implies that the central nervous system 
(CNS) mechanisms activated by administration of FGF1 directly into the brain are not 
engaged by circulating FGF1. This possibility is strengthened by evidence that glucose 
lowering induced by systemic FGF1 requires FGFR1 signaling in adipose tissue10, a 
mechanism unlikely to explain the action of FGF1 in the brain.
A physiological role for hypothalamic FGF1 signaling in metabolic homeostasis was first 
suggested by evidence that FGF1 expressed in cells lining the 3rd cerebral ventricle, adjacent 
to the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), is released locally following a meal12. Tanycytes 
(rather than ependymal cells) are the predominant cell type lining the 3rd ventricle in the 
area of the MBH35. These cells have interesting potential as candidate mediators of FGF1 
action, since they send long, filamentous projections from the ventricular surface into 
adjacent hypothalamic parenchyma that can influence neuronal function, are responsive both 
to glucose39,40 and FGFs33, and are implicated as a source of hypothalamic neural 
progenitor cells33. In this context, our finding that 3rd ventricular tanycytes are robustly 
activated by i.c.v. FGF1 (based on induction of c-Fos, a marker of cellular activation), but 
not by i.c.v. FGF19, is of interest given that glucose lowering by i.c.v. FGF1 is sustained, 
Scarlett et al.

 whereas that induced by i.c.v. FGF19 is not. Thus, the activation of these cells by FGF1 
tracks with the ability of FGF peptides to induce diabetes remission. We further demonstrate 
that in response to i.c.v. FGF1, the potent neuroprotective protein HSP25 is induced in both 
3rd ventricular tanycytes and an adjacent set of periventricular astrocytes13, but not in 
hypothalamic neurons. These observations justify additional investigation into the role of 
tanycytes in FGF1-mediated diabetes remission.
A remarkable aspect of glucose lowering induced by i.c.v. FGF1 is that it occurs only in 
hyperglycemic and not in non-diabetic animals. To account both for this selectivity and for 
the sustained nature of its anti-diabetic effect, we hypothesize that 1) neurocircuits involved 
in glucose homeostasis are dysfunctional in T2D, 2) this dysfunction contributes to 
hyperglycemia, and 3) FGF1 ameliorates this dysfunction without impacting the same 
neurocircuits in non-diabetic animals. Accordingly, one might anticipate that in diabetic 
mice, central FGF1 administration elicits structural changes in brain areas involved in 
glucoregulation. Although preliminary, our finding of an association between FGF1-induced 
diabetes remission and a modest increase in whole hypothalamic content of synaptophysin, a 
synaptic marker protein36,37, implies that either synaptogenesis was increased or that 
synaptic pruning was decreased (or both). Additional studies to address these possibilities 
and to identify the hypothalamic areas involved are warranted.
In conclusion, we report that central FGF1 administration unmasks the brain’s inherent 
capacity to induce sustained diabetes remission. This effect is elicited without the risk of 
hypoglycemia, in a manner that is truly weight loss-independent, via a novel peripheral 
mechanism characterized by increased glucose clearance into skeletal muscle and liver, and 
without the need for surgical revision of the gastrointestinal tract. The translational relevance 
of this discovery is heightened by the feasibility of therapeutic FGF1 delivery to the CNS via 
the intranasal route, which has been established in rodents14,21. Translational studies are 
warranted to determine if this type of strategy may one day be employed to promote diabetes 
remission in humans.
ONLINE METHODS
Animals
Male, 8-week-old ob/ob (B6.Cg-Lepob/J), ob/ob (BTBR.Cg-Lepob/WiscJ), db/db 
(B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J), and C57BL/6J (WT) mice were purchased from Jackson 
Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Transgenic FGFR1-EGFP (GP338Gsat/Mmucd) mice were 
obtained from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (UC Davis, Davis, CA) and 
analysis was performed on male, 8-week-old mice. Male, 5-week-old ZDF rats (ZDF-Leprfa/
Crl) were purchased from Charles River and analysis was performed on 8-week-old rats. To 
generate male, 8-week-old liver-specific double knockout of the IR and FoxO1 (LIRFKO) 
mice and littermate controls (IRF fl/fl), we crossed IR(fl/fl); FoxO1(fl/fl);Albumin-
Cre(tg/wt) mice to IR(fl/fl); FoxO1(fl/fl); Albumin-Cre(wt/wt) animals on a mixed 
(C57BL6/J-FVB/N) background, as previously described30. All animals were housed 
individually under specific pathogen-free conditions in a temperature-controlled room with a 
12:12 h light:dark cycle. Mice were provided with ad-libitum (ad-lib) access to water and 
either standard laboratory chow (LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) or a 60% high-fat diet (HFD;

provided with ad-lib access to water and Purina 5008 diet (Animal Specialties, Inc., 
Hubbard, OR). All procedures were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines for the 
care and use of animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee at either the University of Washington (Seattle, Washington) or Vanderbilt 
University (Nashville, Tennessee). Except as noted below, we did not exclude any animals 
from analysis. Mice and rats were randomly assigned into various surgical and treatment 
groups detailed below with no blinding.
Criteria for sustained diabetes remission
Based on evidence that in non-diabetic, wild-type mice, blood glucose levels obtained under 
ad-lib fed conditions are typically in the range of 100 mg/dl and rarely exceed values of 150 
mg/dl (Fig. 2b and unpublished data), sustained remission of diabetes was defined as a 
reduction of mean blood glucose levels obtained under ad-lib fed conditions to values <200 
mg/dl that lasted for at least 4 weeks. Studies investigating whether sustained diabetes 
remission occurred were therefore conducted for a minimum of 4 weeks, with blood glucose 
levels obtained under ad-lib fed conditions at least once per week. To assess the durability of 
diabetes remission induced by i.c.v. FGF1, some studies were conducted for up to 18 weeks. 
Animals meeting the above criteria for >4 mo were deemed to have stable and seemingly 
permanent diabetes remission.
Surgery
Cannulation of the third ventricle (3rd V) or lateral ventricle (LV;26-ga, Plastics One, 
Roanoke, VA) were performed under isoflurane anesthesia using the following stereotaxic 
coordinates:41,42 For mice, 3rd V: −1.8 mm posterior to bregma; mid-line, and −4.3 mm 
below the skull surface; LV: − 0.7 mm posterior to bregma; 1.3 mm lateral, and 1.3 mm 
below the skull surface; and for rats, LV: −0.8 mm posterior to bregma; 1.5 mm lateral, and 
2.6 mm below the skull surface. For measurement of basal glucose turnover followed by a 
FSIGT, adult male ob/ob (B6) mice underwent LV cannulation and catheterization of both 
the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein during the same surgical session. Animals 
received buprenorphine hydrochloride (Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc., Richmond, 
VA) at the completion of the surgery and were allowed to recover for at least 7 d prior to 
study while food intake and body weight were recorded. We excluded from the study mice 
and rats whose body weight had not recovered 7 d after surgery.
Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections
Rodents were monitored for several days to ensure that mean blood glucose values were 
matched between study groups prior to i.c.v. injection. For i.c.v. injections via the 3rd V in 
mice, recombinant mouse FGF1 (mFGF1; Prospec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd, East Brunswick, 
NJ) was dissolved in sterile water at a concentration of 3 μg/μl and injected over 60 s in a 
final volume of 1 μl using a (33-ga) needle extending 1 mm beyond the tip of the i.c.v. 
cannula. For i.c.v. injections via the LV in mice, recombinant mouse FGF1 (mFGF1; 
Prospec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd, East Brunswick, NJ) or recombinant human FGF1 (hFGF1; 
a generous gift from Novo Nordisk) were dissolved in sterile water or phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS), respectively, at a concentration of 1.5 μg/μl and injected over 60 s in a final

 volume of 2 μl using a (33-ga) needle extending 0.8 mm beyond the tip of the i.c.v. cannula. 
Recombinant human FGF19 (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA) was dissolved in 
0.9% normal saline at a concentration of 2 μg/μl and was administered via the LV as 
previously described2. Recombinant rat FGF1 (rFGF1; Prospec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd, East 
Brunswick, NJ ) was dissolved in sterile water at a concentration of 1 μg/μl and injected over 
60s into the LV in a final volume of 3 μl using a (33-ga) needle extending 1 mm beyond the 
tip of the i.c.v. cannula.
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing
ipGTTs were conducted in 6 h-fasted animals by measuring blood glucose levels at t = 0, 15, 
30, 60, 90, and 120 min from a tail capillary blood sample using a hand-held glucometer 
(Abbott FreeStyle Lite, Abbot Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA) following an intraperitoneal 
(i.p.) injection of glucose (30% dextrose) at a dose of either 0.5 or 2 g/kg body weight, 
depending on basal glycemia.
Body composition analysis
Total body fat mass was measured using quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(EchoMRI 3-in-1 Animal Tissue Composition Analyzer; Echo Medical Systems, Houston, 
TX) available through the Energy Balance and Glucose Metabolism Core of the NIDDK-
funded Nutrition Obesity Research Center at the University of Washington.
Subcutaneous injections
Recombinant mouse FGF1 (mFGF1; Prospec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd, East Brunswick, NJ) 
was dissolved in sterile water at a concentration of 1.5 μg/μl and administered s.c. in a final 
volume of 50 μl of vehicle (Veh) solution (0.9% normal saline).
DIO WT-STZ mice
After consuming a HFD for 3 mo to induce diet-induced obesity (DIO), WT mice underwent 
cannulation of the LV and 7 d later received either three consecutive daily i.p. injections of 
streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a low dose (40 mg/kg body weight) 
(DIO-LD STZ) to induce moderate hyperglycemia (~150–200 mg/dl), or a single s.c. 
injection of a high dose of STZ (100 mg/kg body weight) to induce more severe 
hyperglycemia (DIO-HD STZ). Measures of blood glucose blood glucose levels, food 
intake, and body weight were recorded throughout the study.
Basal glucose turnover
Basal glucose turnover analysis (as previously described43) was performed in 5 h-fasted 
ob/ob (B6) mice 7 d after receiving i.c.v. injection of either mFGF1 (3 μg) or Veh (0.9% 
normal saline). At t = −90 min, a continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion of [3-3H] glucose 
was commenced (10 μCi bolus + 0.05 μCi·min−1). Blood samples were taken at t = −10 and 
0 min to calculate the basal glucose turnover rate (GTR), which at steady state is equal to the 
rates of both glucose production and glucose disposal, and the peripheral glucose clearance 
rate (calculated as the glucose disposal rate divided by the plasma glucose concentration18).

 Frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT)
Following the basal glucose turnover study, the same cohort of ob/ob (B6) mice was 
subjected to an FSIGT. Blood sampling was performed via an arterial catheter in 
unrestrained, conscious animals. A continuous infusion of saline-washed erythrocytes was 
commenced at t = 0 min to prevent a >5% fall in hematocrit. Baseline fasting blood samples 
were drawn at −10 and 0 min. Based on a published protocol22, a bolus of 50% dextrose 
(0.75 g/kg body weight) was injected iv over a period of 15s at t = 0 min. Blood (20 μl) was 
sampled both for measurement of glucose using a hand-held glucometer (Accu-Chek Aviva 
Plus, Roche; Indianapolis, IN ) and for subsequent assay of plasma insulin and lactate levels 
at time points 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 30 and 60 min after the glucose injection. Additional 
samples were obtained for blood glucose measurement at 3, 5, 6, 10, 14, 18, 25, 40 and 50 
min using a hand-held glucometer.
Minimal Model analysis and calculations
The plasma insulin and blood glucose profiles generated from the FSIGTs were analyzed 
using MinMod software to quantify insulin-independent glucose disposal (SG) and insulin 
sensitivity (SI), as previously described22. From the FSIGT, insulin secretion was quantified 
as the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg), a measure of islet β-cell function in 
response to a glucose load, based on plasma insulin values between t = 0–4 min22.
2-[14C] deoxyglucose ([2-14C]DG) study
7 d after ob/ob (C6) mice received i.c.v. injection via the LV of either mFGF1 (3 μg) or Veh 
(0.9% normal saline), a 13 μCi dose of [2-14C]DG was administered via the jugular vein to 
assess tissue-specific glucose clearance (Kg; μl/min/mg tissue). At t = 5, 15, 25 and 35 min, 
arterial blood was sampled to measure blood glucose and [2-14C]DG. Subsequently, the 
mice were anesthetized and the following tissues were excised, immediately frozen in liquid 
nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until future tissue analysis: skeletal muscle [soleus, tibalis 
anterior, gastrocnemius and superficial white vastus lateralis], visceral epididymal white 
adipose tissue (EWAT), subcutaneous gonadal adipose tissue (SubQ WAT), brown adipose 
tissue (BAT), heart and brain.
Plasma and tissue analysis
Blood samples were collected into EDTA-treated tubes for measurement of plasma 
hormones and metabolites. Whole blood was centrifuged and plasma removed for 
subsequent measurement of plasma immunoreactive insulin [either by ELISA (Crystal 
Chem, Inc., IL) or by a radioimmunoassay kit from Millipore (Billerica, MA; performed by 
the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center Hormone Assay & Analytical Services Core)], and for 
measurement of glucagon and corticosterone levels by ELISA (Mercodia, Winston Salem, 
NC; and ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH). Plasma lactate levels were determined using a 
GM9D glucose direct analyzer (Analox Instruments, UK). Plasma lipids were measured 
with enzymatic colorimetric assays using the following kits: Triglycerides and total 
cholesterol from Raichem (San Diego, CA); non-esterified free fatty acid (NEFA) from 
Wako Diagnostics (Richmond, VA). Liver glycogen levels were determined using a 
colorimetric assay (Biovision, Milpitas, CA) and were normalized to grams wet weight. For

 the basal glucose turnover and [2-14C]DG, radioactivity of [3-3H] glucose and [2-14C]DG 
were processed as previously described44 and determined by scintillation counting.
RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from hypothalamus, liver and BAT using TriReagent (Sigma-
Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and NucleoSpin RNA (Fischer Scientific, Federal Way, WA). Levels 
of specific transcripts were quantified by real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7900 HT; Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) and the following 
specific primers: Gck (forward-CAAGCTGCACCCGAGCTT; reverse-
TGATTCGATGAAGGTGATTTCG), Pklr (forward-TGATGATTGGACGCTGCAA; 
reverse-CATTGGCCACATCGCTTG), Gys2 (forward-ACCAAGGCCAAAACGACAG; 
reverse-GGGCTCACATTGTTCTACTTGA), Pck1 (forward-
GGCGGAGCATATGCTGATCC; reverse-CCACAGGCACTAGGGAAGGC), G6pc 
(forward-TCAACCTCGTCTTCAAGTGGATT; reverse-
CTGCTTTATTATAGGCACGGAGCT), Ucp1 (forward-ACTGCCACACCTCCAGTCATT; 
reverse-CTTTGCCTCACTCAGGATTGG) and Hspb1 (forward-
ACGTCAACCACTTCGCTCCGGAGG; reverse-
CTTGGCTCCAGACTGTTCAGACTTCGCTGAC). Results were normalized to the 
housekeeping gene Rn18s (forward-CGGACAGGATTGACAGATTG; reverse-
CAAATCGCTCCACCAACTAA) to correct for internal variances. For comparative 
analysis, RNA ratios of the treatment group were normalized to the i.c.v. Veh control group.
Systemic administration of insulin receptor antagonist
DIO WT mice (fed a HFD for 3 mo), chow-fed LIRFKO and littermate IRF fl/fl control 
mice underwent LV cannulation. Following a 1 week recovery, mice underwent sc 
implantation of an osmotic micropump (Alzet, Durect Corp., Cupertino, CA) loaded with 
the high affinity insulin receptor antagonist S961 (dissolved in PBS; a generous gift from 
Novo Nordisk) at a dose designed to continuously infuse the drug at a rate of either 29 nmol/
week for the HFD-fed or 25 nmol/week for the chow-fed mice for 2 week. On Day 2 or 3, 
following micropump implantation, the mice received a single i.c.v. injection of either 
mFGF1 (3 μg) or Veh (0.9% normal saline). Daily blood glucose levels, food intake and 
body weight were recorded throughout the study.
Effect of i.c.v. FGF1 and FGF19 on c-Fos induction in hypothalamic tanycytes
To assess induction of c-fos in 3rd ventricular tanycytes in response to central administration 
of either FGF1 or FGF19, FGFR1-EGFP transgenic mice underwent LV cannulation. 
Following 1-week recovery, habituated animals were fasted for 5 h and then received an 
i.c.v. injection of Veh, mFGF1 (3 μg), or hFGF19 (3 μg). Ninety minutes later, mice were 
anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde 
(PFA) in 0.1M PBS, and brains removed and processed for immunohistochemical analysis. 
Briefly, sections were incubated in rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody (1:100,000; PC38; Oncogene 
Research Products, Boston, MA), followed by incubation in donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 594 
(1:1,000; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Although these studies were conducted in 
transgenic mice in which GFP expression is driven by the FGFR1 promoter, co-localization 
of GFP staining with c-Fos was not performed due to concerns regarding the extent to which

 GFP expression is specific to FGFR1+ cells in these mice. C-Fos was quantified from the 
cells (both ependymal and tanycytes) lining the 3rd ventricle from anatomically matched 
hypothalamic sections using Image J software (NIH).
Effect of i.c.v. FGF1 on HSP25 expression in hypothalamic tanycytes and astrocytes
Adult, male WT mice were sacrificed 24 h after receiving i.c.v. injections via the LV of 
mFGF1 (3 μg) or Veh. After cervical dislocation, the brain was extracted and wholemounts 
of the 3rd ventricle walls, including the hypothalamus, were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA/
0.1% Triton X-100 (TX) overnight at 4°C. Wholemounts were incubated in primary and 
secondary antibodies in PBS with 0.5% TX and 10% normal goat or donkey serum for 24 h 
at 4°C. Primary antibodies: rabbit anti-mouse HSP25 (homologous to human HSP27; 1:500; 
SPA801, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY), mouse anti-GFAP (1:10,000; C9205; 
Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO), and chicken anti-vimentin (1:1,000; EMD Millipore 
AB5733, Billerica, MA). Secondary antibodies: conjugated to Alexa Fluor dyes (1:1,000; 
goat or donkey polyclonal, Molecular Probes, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). After 
staining, the ventricular walls were dissected from underlying parenchyma as slivers of 
tissue 300–400 μm thick and mounted on a slide with mounting media and a coverslip. 
Confocal images were taken on a Leica SP5 (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). 
Quantification of vimentin or GFAP co-expression in HSP25+ cells was performed in 3 
high-power confocal images (116.4 × 116.4 μm2) evenly spaced across the ventral to dorsal 
span of the HSP25+ band in the posterior 3rd ventricle.
Western blot
Brains were removed, hypothalami were dissected and quickly frozen on dry ice and stored 
at −80°C. Total protein lysates were prepared by homogenizing hypothalami in 3 volumes of 
lysis buffer (T-PER, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) containing protease inhibitor cocktail 
(cOmplete; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and phosphatase inhibitors (phosSTOP 
Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets; Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Homogenates were 
centrifuged and the supernatants retained for western analysis. Protein concentrations were 
determined with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). 
Proteins (40 μg/lane) were separated on a 10% precast SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, 
CA). After electrophoresis at 100V for 90 min, the proteins were transferred for 1 h at 4 °C 
onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blocked in 
5% non-fat milk for 1 h. Membranes were incubated overnight (at 4°C) with rabbit anti-
synaptophysin (1:1,000; SAB4502906, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) or rabbit anti-β-
Tubulin III (Tuj 1; 1:1,000, T3952, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Following washes with 
tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST), membranes were incubated 1 h with HRP-
conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:5,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and 
visualized using the Pierce ECL kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Blots were scanned 
and quantified using Image J software (NIH). All protein band density was normalized to the 
loading control β-tubulin III.
Statistical analysis
For each study, groups receiving i.c.v. Veh vs. FGF1 (or FGF19) were matched for age, body 
weight and blood glucose levels. Sample sizes of 6–8/group were predicated on detecting

 with ~80% power a blood glucose group difference of 100 mg/dl assuming a within group 
standard deviation of 55 mg/dl. Group by time mixed factorial designs were analyzed using 
linear mixed model analysis (SPSS v. 23, IBM Corp., Somers, NY) and mixed factorial 
analyses (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA). Basic pairwise comparisons were by 
independent samples t-tests with Satterthwaite adjustment for unequal variances where 
indicated by significant Levene’s tests. Within time-point pairwise assessments of group 
differences were rendered in terms of 95% confidence intervals to convey effect sizes and 
their patterns over time. A two-sample unpaired Student’s t-test was used for two-group 
comparisons and a one-way ANOVA was performed for three-group comparisons. Data met 
the normality assumptions of the statistical tests. Animals were not excluded from the 
studies unless otherwise indicated and the investigators were not blinded to study conditions. 
Alpha was set at P<0.05, 2-tail.
