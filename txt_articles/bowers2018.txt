The known Empirical data on the psychological and social
challenges faced by remote mining and construction workers
and the associated risks of mental distress and suicide are
limited.
The new This sample of remote mining and construction
workers had higher rates of psychological distress than the
general Australian community. Common stressors included
relationship problems with partners, financial stress, shift
rosters, and social isolation.
The implications Our findings highlight the importance of early
intervention mental health and suicide prevention programs for
remote mining, resource and construction workers.
R
emote mining, resource and construction workers are
susceptible to a wide range of stressors, with recognised
risks for mental health and wellbeing.1-6 In particular, FIFO
(fly in/fly out) and DIDO (drive in/drive out) employment ar-
rangements have become more common in recent years, accom-
panied by a range of lifestyle stressors, such as motelling (hot-
bedding), compressed rosters, and social isolation.6,7 These ar-
rangements can increase relationship and family strains,8,9 sleep
disturbances,5,10 and risky behaviour, such as excessive drink-
ing.2,11 Male predominance in the resource and mining workforce
(88%)12 and their low rates of help-seeking have motivated
research into the risks of mental ill health in the FIFO population.13
Several studies have found elevated rates of mental health problems
among FIFO workers.4,5,14,15 High rates of psychological distress in
FIFO workers have been reported,4,5 particularly in those on high
compression rosters (1e4 weeks on/1 week off),4,16,17 who report
dissatisfaction with shift lengths, challenges in maintaining conflict-
free relationships because of prolonged periods away from home,
and lower levels of workelife balance than any other Australian
industry group.16,17 Large Australian studies have also found
significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety among FIFO
workers than in the general population,14,15 with the risk of anxiety
and stress twice as high for younger workers (18e33 years) as for
older workers.15 However, research findings on mental health in
mining have been inconsistent;6,10 with some studies finding the
prevalence of mental health problems among FIFO workers com-
parable with that for the general population.2,18,19 Further, positive
impacts of the FIFO lifestyle have been reported, including
improved coping skills and stronger relationships.6,10
The mixed results have been attributed to the logistic difficulties of
research at mining sites, and to methodological problems, such as
sampling bias and small sample sizes,20 variations in measure-
ments and study design,21 and low rates of help-seeking that reflect
fears of stigmatisation, bullying, and termination and loss of in-
come.20 In light of parliamentary investigations into suicide by
mining workers,22-24 a clear understanding of the mental health
needs of the mining workforce is essential, particularly of workers
with a commuting arrangement (FIFO, DIDO, or bus in/bus out).
We collected data on the mental health and wellbeing of remote
mining and construction workers to provide a snapshot of the
prevalence of psychological distress in this workforce; we also
investigated the correlates of distress in these workers.
Methods
This investigation was conducted as part of the delivery of a
prevention program by Rural and Remote Mental Health
(RRMH; http:/
/www.rrmh.com.au) and their remote mining and
construction client companies.
Abstract
Objectives: To assess the prevalence and correlates of
psychological distress in a sample of remote mining and
construction workers in Australia.
Design, setting: A cross-sectional, anonymous Wellbeing and
Lifestyle Survey at ten mining sites in South Australia and
Western Australia, administered at meetings held during
2013e2015.
Participants: 1124 employees at remote construction, and open
cut and underground mining sites completed the survey.
Main outcome measures: General psychological distress
(Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, K10) and self-reported
overall mental health status; work, lifestyle and family factors
correlated with level of psychological distress.
Results: The final sample comprised 1124 workers; 93.5% were
men, 63% were aged 25e44 years. 311 respondents (28%) had
K10 scores indicating high/very high psychological distress,
compared with 10.8% for Australia overall. The most frequently
reported stressors were missing special events (86%),
relationship problems with partners (68%), financial stress
(62%), shift rosters (62%), and social isolation (60%). High
psychological distress was significantly more likely in workers
aged 25e34 years (v � 55 years: odds ratio [OR], 3.2; P ¼ 0.001)
and workers on a 2 weeks on/1 week off roster (v 4 weeks on/1
week off: OR, 2.4; P < 0.001). Workers who were very or
extremely stressed by their assigned tasks or job (OR, 6.2;
P ¼ 0.004), their current relationship (OR, 8.2; P < 0.001), or their
financial situation (OR, 6.0; P < 0.001) were significantly more
likely to have high/very high K10 scores than those not stressed
by these factors. Workers who reported stress related to
stigmatisation of mental health problems were at the greatest
risk of high/very high psychological distress (v not stressed: OR,
23.5; P < 0.001).
Conclusions: Psychological distress is significantly more
prevalent in the remote mining and construction workforce than
in the overall Australian population. The factors that contribute
to mental ill health in these workers need to be addressed, and
the stigma associated with mental health problems reduced.

 Participants
All employees based at any of the RRMH client companies and
working on remote Australian mining and construction sites in
South Australia and Western Australia during 2013e2015 were
invited to participate. No exclusion criteria were applied; partici-
pants with low literacy levels were offered assistance to complete
the survey.
Measures
All participants were administered the RRMH Wellbeing and
Lifestyle Survey, which requires no longer than 20 minutes to
complete. This survey comprised three sections:
�
Demographic information and work characteristics: Standard de-
mographic questions (sex, age, level of education, relationship
status), and questions about work characteristics (including
roster swing, resource sector [open cut, underground, con-
struction], location of rest and relaxation).
�
Common symptomsofstressand burnout:Twenty-threeitems about
stress related to specific lifestyle, family and work factors.
�
Physical and mental health: The final section of the survey asked
participants to describe dietary habits and overall physical
and mental health status, rated from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).
The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale questionnaire (K10)
was administered to obtain a validated measure of psycho-
logical distress that could be compared with that of the
general population.
Procedures
An RRMH representative attended a series of workplace Toolbox
Talks at ten mining sites (four construction, three underground
mining, three open cut mining sites) across Western Australia and
South Australia during 2013e2015. Toolbox Talks are brief, usually
compulsory meetings at mining sites that provide information on
safety and daily work plans before a shift begins. Managers
informed workers in advance that the Wellbeing and Lifestyle
Survey would be administered at this talk, and assured them that
results would be provided to their company only in an aggregated
format.
The RRMH representative introduced the survey by explaining its
purpose and length, and by describing the processes that ensured
the anonymity and confidentiality of the data collected. All at-
tenders were informed that participation was voluntary, and this
consent information was also included on the first page of the
survey form. Individual consent to participation was inferred from
completion of the survey.
Statistical analysis
All data were analysed in SPSS 24 (IBM). Frequencies and per-
centages were calculated for categorical variables; continuous
variables were summarised as means and standard deviations
(SDs). The K10 responses were summed to give a cumulative score
(range, 10e50), with total scores categorised according to pre-
established thresholds:25 low (10e15), moderate (16e21), high
(22e29) and very high stress levels (30e50).
Predictors of psychological distress were assessed in a two-stage
process. First, a series of univariate multinomial regressions were
conducted, including all demographic variables that might influ-
ence psychological distress. The second stage was a multivariable
regression analysis of psychological distress and all work charac-
teristics, controlling all demographic variables with a significant
impact on psychological distress. This process was repeated for all
lifestyle and family characteristics. Collinearity of variables was
assessed (Spearman r) before inclusion in the multinomial model;
when variables were highly correlated (P � 0.05), one was
randomly selected for inclusion in the model. Odds ratios (ORs)
were calculated for all significant predictors (P � 0.05) and
emphasis was placed on the magnitude of difference in scores. As
this was an exploratory analysis, correction for multiple compari-
sons was not applied.
Ethics approval
After approval by the client companies, the research protocol was
submitted to Bellberry Human Research Ethics Committee, who
deemed the study low risk and appropriate for scientific publica-
tion (reference, 2015-08-535).
Results
The Wellbeing and Lifestyle Survey was administered at morning
and evening Toolbox Talks for up to 3 days at each of the ten
participating sites; between 50 and 100 workers attended each
Toolbox Talk. As the time available for administering the survey
was limited, and to alleviate concerns about anonymity and
confidentiality,
attendance
sheets
and
unreturned
surveys
were not collected; as a result, a precise response rate could
not
be
calculated.
Based
on
the
reports
of
the
RRMH
representatives, it was estimated that 1500 workers were
invited to participate in the surveys (about 65% of workers at
each site).
The Wellbeing and Lifestyle Survey was completed by 1461
workers. Data from two mining sites at which the K10 was not
administered were excluded from analysis (176 survey forms); a
further 161 were excluded because a substantial amount of
data was missing. The final sample comprised a total of 1124
workers. There were no significant differences between survey
respondents excluded because of missing data and respondents
included in the analysis with respect to sex (men, 92.5% v 93.5%;
P ¼ 0.41) or age (mean, 37.1 [SD, 12.1 years] v 37.3 years [SD, 10.7
years]; P ¼ 0.46).
Most respondents were FIFO workers (1105, 98%), and 649 (57.8%)
were employed at remote sites in WA. The sex and age composition
of the final sample of 1124 respondents was consistent with
recently reported figures for the remote construction and mining
workforce:24 most respondents were men (93.5%) and aged 25e44
years (63%). Nearly half the respondents (519, 46%) were
employed on a 2 weeks on/1 week off roster, and one-third (374,
33%) on a 4 weeks on/1 week off roster (Box 1).
The distribution of K10 psychological distress scores for the survey
respondents was skewed towards higher values than that of the
general Australian population (Box 2); the median K10 score was
17 (interquartile range, 13e22). More than one-quarter of re-
spondents had scores indicating high or very high psychological
distress (311, 28%), compared with 10.8% for the general popula-
tion; a higher proportion of respondents rated their own mental
health as poor or fair (22%) than did the general population
(14.8%).
The most commonly reported sources of stress were missing spe-
cial events while on site (86.5%) and relationship problems with
partners (68.0%). More than half the respondents were worried by
financial stress (62.3%), shift rosters (62.0%), and social isolation
(60.2%). The inability to practise religious or spiritual beliefs was
nominated as a stressor by 11.2% of respondents. A total of 41% of

 respondents were worried about the stigma attached to mental
health problems, and 38.5% reported stress caused by the un-
availability of help when needed (Box 3).
Age, relationship status, roster swing and mining sector were sig-
nificant predictors of psychological distress in the univariate
multinomial regression analysis (Box 4; online Appendix) and were
included in the final combined multinomial model. Three variables
were excluded because of collinearity (stress related to missing
special events, social isolation, and stress caused by management).
Respondents aged 34 or less were three times as likely to report
high levels of distress as more senior workers, (25e34 years: OR,
3.2; P ¼ 0.001; 35e44 years: OR, 2.6; P < 0.018 respectively), and
respondents who were separated were more likely than singles to
have high or very high K10 levels (OR, 3.7; P ¼ 0.001). The factor
most strongly associated with psychological distress was the work
roster (P < 0.001); those on 1 week on/1 week off (OR, 1.6;
P ¼ 0.039) or 2 weeks on/1 week off swings (OR, 2.4; P < 0.001) had
about twice the risk of moderate psychological distress of those
who worked 4 weeks on/1 week off (Box 4).
The strongest predictor of psychological distress overall was fear of
stigmatisation for mental health problems; workers who reported
being stressed by this factor were 20 times (OR, 19.6; P < 0.001), and
those who were extremely stressed about itwere 24 times (OR, 23.5;
P < 0.001) as likely to have high or very high levels of distress
values (Box 5).
Work-related factors, such as stress caused by immediate supervi-
sors (P ¼ 0.024), job tasks (P ¼ 0.034), shift length (P ¼ 0.042), and
shift roster (P ¼ 0.050), were significantly associated with high
distress levels. Workers who felt very or extremely stressed by their
immediate supervisors were four times as likely to experience high
orvery high levels ofdistressas thosewho were not stressed bytheir
supervisors (OR, 4.3; P ¼ 0.003). Respondents reporting job- or task-
specific stress were twice as likely to report high or very high levels
of distress than those who did not experience any stress (OR, 2.2;
P ¼ 0.031); thosewhowerehighlystressedweresixtimesas likelyto
report high or very high levels of distress (OR, 6.2; P ¼ 0.004).
Workers who were stressed by the length of their shift were more
than twice as likely (OR, 2.4; P ¼ 0.017) to experience high levels of
distress, while those concerned with theirroster swing were twice as
likely to have moderate levels of distress (stressed: OR, 2.2;
P ¼ 0.010; very stressed: OR, 2.6; P ¼ 0.017) (Box 5).
Workers who reported stress in their relationship with their
partner were eight times as likely to have high psychological

Discussion
We found elevated levels of psychological distress in the remote
mining and construction workforce in Australia. The risk of
psychological distress was significantly higher among workers
aged 44 years or less, workers who had separated from
their partner, and workers employed on compressed roster
swings (2 weeks on/1 week off or 1 week on/1 week off).
These findings differ from those of some earlier studies that
found that the mental health and wellbeing of the mining and
construction workforce were similar to those of the general
Australian community.2,16,17
Although the strongest predictor of psychological distress was
stress related to the stigmatisation of mental health problems, a
number of work-, family- and relationship-related stressors were
also significantly associated with high psychological distress.
These results are consistent with previous suggestions that the
unique characteristics of the remote mining lifestyle can cause
psychological distress.1,3-6 In particular, psychological distress was
significantly higher among workers assigned to a swing rosters
with 1 or 2 weeks on, and among workers who felt stressed about
the length of their rostered shifts. Earlier research found that the

 4 weeks on/1 week off swing was most detrimental to mental
wellbeing.16,17 Our divergent findings may be attributable to our
broader workforce sample, particularly our inclusion of under-
ground mining workers, who are less frequently captured in
research studies.
Consistent with previous studies,2,7,8 the remoteness of the mining
lifestyle was significantly associated with high psychological
distress. Most notably, stress associated with the stigma attached to
mental health problems was the strongest predictor of high psy-
chological distress. Given that 40% of respondents rated stigma a
source of stress, this finding is alarming, and highlights the
importance of early interventions and suicide prevention pro-
grams based on improving mental health literacy.
Our study was facilitated by the support of the relevant companies,
but the logistic problems inherent to research at mining sites
remained (restricted opportunities to meet with employees). This
limitation resulted in a substantial amount of missing data (161 of
1285 surveys, 12.5%) and the inability to provide an accurate esti-
mate of the survey response rate. Further, the survey was admin-
istered to groups of as many as 100 workers in a time-pressured
environment, preventing our assessing the possibility of biased
responding; given the workplace setting, socially desirable re-
sponses are not unexpected. Finally, we did not examine in-
teractions between demographic, work, lifestyle and family factors
and their effects on psychological distress.
Nevertheless, our findings have informed the development and
expansion of RRMH mental health education programs, including
material (funded by the Movember Foundation, au.movember.
com) tailored to the special features of the remote mining and
construction workforce identified by our research. Moreover, our
findings have the potential to inform health and safety policy and
practice more broadly, particularly given the growing awareness
of the levels of mental distress and suicide rates among workers in
this industry.
