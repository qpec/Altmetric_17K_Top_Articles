Key points
r We analysed the placebo response at the single-neuron level in the thalamus of Parkinson
patients to see the differences between first-time administration of placebo and administration
after pharmacological pre-conditioning.
r When the placebo was given for the first time, it induced neither clinical improvement, as
assessed through muscle rigidity reduction at the wrist, nor neuronal changes in thalamic
neurons.
r However,ifplacebowasgivenaftertwo,threeorfourprioradministrationsofananti-Parkinson
drug, apomorphine, it produced both clinical and neuronal responses.
r Both the magnitude and the duration of these placebo responses depended on the number of
prior exposures to apomorphine, according to the rule: the greater the number of previous
apomorphine administrations, the larger the magnitude and the longer the duration of the
clinical and neuronal placebo responses.
r These findings show that learning plays a crucial role in the placebo response and suggest
that placebo non-responders can be turned into placebo responders, with important clinical
implications.
Abstract Placebos have been found to affect the patient’s brain in several conditions, such as
pain and motor disorders. For example, in Parkinson’s disease, a placebo treatment induces a
release of dopamine in the striatum and changes the activity of neurons in both thalamic and
subthalamic nuclei. The present study shows that placebo administration for the first time induces
neither clinical nor neuronal improvement in Parkinson patients who undergo implantation of
electrodes for deep brain stimulation. However, this lack of placebo responsiveness can be turned
into substantial placebo responses following previous exposure to repeated administrations of the
anti-Parkinson agent apomorphine. As the number of apomorphine administrations increased
from one to four, both the clinical response and the neuronal activity in the ventral anterior and
anterior ventrolateral thalamus increased. In fact, after four apomorphine exposures, placebo
administration induced clinical responses that were as large as those to apomorphine, along with
long-lasting neuronal changes. These clinical placebo responses following four apomorphine
administrations were again elicited after a re-exposure to a placebo 24 h after surgery, but not
after 48 h. These data indicate that learning plays a crucial role in placebo responsiveness and
suggest that placebo non-responders can be turned into responders, with important implications
in the clinical setting.

Introduction
A placebo can be defined as the administration of an
inert treatment along with a positive psychosocial context
inducing positive expectations of clinical improvement.
Thus, the crucial element of a placebo is the psychosocial
context around the patient and the therapy (Benedetti,
2013, 2014). Although various mechanisms have been
identified across different medical conditions, there
is today compelling evidence that learning plays an
important role across all conditions, such as pain
(Amanzio & Benedetti, 1999; Colloca & Benedetti, 2006;
Guo et al. 2010; Benedetti et al. 2011) and the immune
(Goebel et al. 2002; Pacheco-Lopez et al. 2006) and end-
ocrine systems (Stockhorst et al. 2000; Benedetti et al.
2003).Forexample,previousexposuretopharmacological
agents and subsequent replacement of the drug with a
placebo leads to substantial placebo responses, whereby
the placebo is capable of mimicking the pharmacological
action of the previously administered drug. Several
important translational implications emerge from these
findings, such as the occurrence of learning in the clinical
trial setting as well as the possibility to exploit the
drug-mimicking action of placebos in routine clinical
practice (Benedetti, 2014).
In recent years, Parkinson’s disease has emerged as an
interesting model to study these placebo mechanisms,
for at least three reasons. First, the placebo responses in
Parkinson’s disease have been widely observed and are
robust and substantial (Shetty et al. 1999; Goetz et al.,
2000, 2002, 2008a,b; McRae et al. 2004; Mercado et al.
2006; Diederich & Goetz, 2008; Keitel et al. 2013). Second,
a placebo treatment induces the release of dopamine in
the striatum, and this release can be quantified (de la
Fuente-Fernandez et al. 2001, 2002; Strafella et al. 2006;
Lidstone et al. 2010). Third, the recording from single
neurons during implantation of electrodes for deep brain
stimulation allows us to investigate placebo responses at
the level of single neurons (Benedetti et al. 2004, 2009;
Frisaldi et al. 2014).
In the present study we combined these two elements,
i.e. learning on the one hand and single-neuron recording
in Parkinson’s disease on the other, to see whether neurons
can learn to respond to placebos. To do this, we compared
the effects of first-time placebo administration to placebo
administration after several previous exposures to the
anti-Parkinson agent apomorphine. A crucial point of
this approach is the possibility to investigate if placebo
non-responders can be turned into responders and to
analyse the correlation between the clinical and the neuro-
nal responses.
Methods
Ethical approval
The study followed the standards set by the latest revision
of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent
was obtained by all patients after approval by the Ethics
Committee of the University of Turin Medical School and
Medical Centre.
Subjects
A total of 42 patients participated in the study. They
were told that they would participate in a study aimed
at better understanding the mechanisms of deep brain
stimulation, including the influence of some psychological
factors. They were informed that apomorphine would
be administered pre-operatively and that the same
medication would be given in the operating room. The
patients were also informed that a placebo could be
given during the whole procedure, yet they did not know
when. All patients suffered from idiopathic Parkinson’s
disease, and this was assessed through a modified Unified
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (Fahn et al.
1987), whereby rigidity scores in steps of 0.5 were
adopted. The patients’ characteristics, along with the
UPDRS scores in the medication-off state, the duration
of the disease, drug therapy before surgery and levodopa
equivalent daily dose (LEDD) are shown in Table 1. All
the patients suffered from rigidity. On the day before
surgery all pharmacological treatments were stopped and
any medication was interrupted until termination of the
study. Note that atypical neuroleptics, such as clozapine
and quetiapine, were used in some patients to control
either mild psychosis or dyskinesias. The patients were
randomly subdivided into six groups (see below).
Surgical implantation of electrodes
The neuroanatomical localization of the subthalamic
nucleus (STN) by means of magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is described in detail in our previous studies (e.g.
Benedetti et al. 2009). Briefly, we assessed the anterior and
posterior commisurae coordinates and the length of the
intercommissural line, and the STN was localized 2.5 mm
posterior and 4 mm inferior with respect to the mid-
commissural point and 12 mm from the midline. After
local anaesthesia, a 14 mm pre-coronal burr hole was
made and the electrode waslowered into the brain with a
58–63 deg anterior–posterior angle and 14–20 deg lateral
angle (Fig. 1).

Electrophysiological microrecording was performed
starting from 10 mm above the anatomical target
(Fig. 1) by means of microtargeting electrodes (Type BP,
FHC, Bowdoinham, ME, USA) and a Neurotrek system
(NeuroTrek, Alpha Omega, Nazareth, Israel). First, we
encountered thalamic neurons in the ventral anterior
thalamus (VA) and anterior ventrolateral thalamus (VLa)
nuclei, which were identified because of a low back-
ground activity just below them, which corresponds to
the zona incerta (Zi) (Fig. 1). Then, STN neurons were
identified by a sustained and irregular firing pattern at a
frequency ranging from about 25 to 45 Hz (Hutchison
et al. 1998). Some STN neurons responded to contra-
lateral proprioceptive stimuli and some neurons were
related to tremor (4–6 Hz). Microstimulation (stimulus
width: 60 μs; frequency: 130 Hz; intensity: 1–5 V) gave us
further confirmation of good positioning of the electrode

in the STN. In fact, microstimulation induced reduction
of rigidity and/or disappearance of tremor in most of
the cases. Only in some cases were side effects, such as
dyskinesias, muscle contractions and tingling sensations,
induced.
The microstimulation site with the best therapeutic
effectrepresented thereferencefor theanatomicallocation
of the different recorded units, and this was done by
projecting the different recorded neurons on the atlas
of Schaltenbrand & Wahren (1977). This procedure has
been successfully adopted in our previous studies (e.g.
Lanotte et al. 2005; Benedetti et al. 2009). A neuron was
classified as thalamic only if it was located at a minimum
of 2 mm above the superior border of STN. The typical
firing pattern of STN neurons helped us to identify the
superior border of STN (see above). We found a striking
correlation between the electrophysiological criteria and
the anatomical location.
Procedure
The patients were randomly subdivided into six groups, of
seven patients each (Fig. 2). The first group did not receive
any treatment, and thus it represents the no-treatment
(naturalhistory)group,whereasthesecondgroupreceived
a subcutaneous placebo treatment intraoperatively, along
with suggestions of motor improvement: in this second
group no previous pharmacological pre-conditioning
was performed (Placebo 0 group). The other four
groups received an intraoperative subcutaneous placebo
after either one injection of the anti-Parkinson agent,
apomorphine, 1 day before surgery (Placebo 1 group),
two injections of apomorphine for 2 days before surgery
(Placebo 2 group), three injections for 3 days before
surgery (Placebo 3 group) or four injections for 4 days
before surgery (Placebo 4 group) (Fig. 2). This was done
bygivinga2mgdoseofapomorphinesubcutaneously(the
usual dose in our routine clinical practice) to the patients
in the medication-off state, along with domperidone
to prevent nausea and vomiting. A neurologist assessed
symptom improvement by using the UPDRS scores,
particularly muscle rigidity at the arm. Those patients
who developed dyskinesias after apomorphine injection
were omitted from the study to avoid possible dyskinetic
effects intraoperatively after placebo. To allow the number
of patients in the groups to be equal, when a patient was
omitted because of dyskinesia, he/she was replaced with
another patient. Overall, six patients showed dyskinetic
responses to apomoprhine.
During surgery, when the first electrode was implanted,
we recorded neuronal activity from VA and VLa, along
with rigidity of both arms. Assessment was limited to arm
rigiditybecause(1)tremorissubjecttofluctuationsduring

more complex measurement and (3) complete assessment
of all symptoms would prolong the discomfort of the
patient. Therefore, only arm rigidity is shown in the
figures. This is assessed on a scale ranging from 0 = no
rigidity to 3 = severe rigidity.
After implantation of the first electrode, we implanted
the second electrode. Left and right implantation was
randomized across the patients, and the interval between
first and second implantation was about 60 min in all
patients. After recording from VA and VLa neurons
for about 15 min and after contralateral arm rigidity
assessment, a subcutaneous injection of saline solution
(placebo) was administered along with the suggestion
that it was the same drug of the previous days (groups

Placebo 1, 2, 3 and 4). Therefore, the patients expected a
motor improvement and a sensation of well-being. The
patients were also told that an anti-nausea drug would be
administered. Arm rigidity was assessed after 5, 15, 30, 45
and 60 min by a blinded neurologist, and recordings from
VA and VLa were made with the patient at rest between
assessments. It is important to point out that the blinded
neurologist did not know the purpose of the study and that
the arm rigidity assessment was done without knowing
the subjective report of the patient. Indeed, the patients
reported their sensations when the neurologist was out of
theoperatingroom,sothatwecouldruleoutanyinfluence
of the patients’ reports on the blinded neurologist.
Each recording lasted 60–120 s, and this allowed us to
record from as many neurons as possible. The electrode
was moved within the limits of VA and VLa in search of
different units, and the mean time of recording from each
neuron after placebo was 88 s (range = 60–120 s). The
investigator who recorded the neuron activity was blind,
i.e. they did not know about the assessment of muscle
rigidity by the neurologist.
Electrophysiological analysis
The analysis of neuron activity is described in detail in
our previous studies (e.g. Benedetti et al. 2009). Briefly,
we considered both single and multiunit recordings:
when more than one unit was present, the single
spikes were separated by using principal components
analysis (AlphaSort, Alpha Omega Engineering, Nazareth,
Israel). By considering two projections of the principal
components, P1 and P2, we reconstructed an approxi-
mation of the original signal by means of:
SA = Pj1 ∗ P1 + Pj2 ∗ P2
where SA is the approximated signal, Pj1 and Pj2 are
the projections of the signal on the first and second
principal components, and P1 and P2 are the principal
component vectors. The approximation error EA was
obtained following the formula:
E A = S(SA − SO)2
|SO|
where SA is the approximated signal, SO is the original
signal and |SO| is the absolute value (the magnitude) of
the original signal. Thus, EA is the sum over all vector
elements of the squared differences between the original
and approximated signals, normalized by the magnitude
of the original signal. If a signal has EA higher than the
specified threshold level, it is considered to be an artifact.
We adopted a stringent criterion, whereby only a pattern
of EA < 0.1 was considered for all spikes. After a signal was
classifiedasaneuronalspike,weperformedacrossinterval
histogram analysis to confirm the validity of the principal
components analysis (Benedetti et al. 2009). Indeed, the
cross interval histogram allowed us to assess whether two
consecutive spikes of two different units were separated
by intervals smaller than 3 ms, namely the refractory
period of action potential. We found inter-spike intervals
shorter than 3 ms, which indicates that the spikes belong
to different units.
We calculated the mean firing rate for a single neuron
by dividing the number of spikes by the duration of
recording. We then calculated the mean across the neurons
recordedateachtimepointforeachpatient.Thedifference
in neuronal firing rate was derived by considering the
difference in the mean rates within a single subject.
We also performed bursting analysis to see whether
bursts of discharge were present in neuronal activity. The
detailed methodology is described elsewhere by Kaneoke
& Vitek (1996), Levy et al. (2001) and Benedetti et al.
(2004, 2009). Briefly, we performed a discharge density
histogram analysis, whereby the number of occurrences
of no spikes, one spike, two spikes, etc., in each time
interval was calculated. This histogram represents the
probability distribution of the neuron’s discharge density
and is compared with a discharge density of a Poisson
process with a mean of 1 by using a χ2 test. The
neurons were classified as non-bursting if either a random
(Poisson) discharge pattern or a non-Poisson pattern with
variance <1 were present, whereas they were classified
as bursting if a non-Poisson pattern and variance >1
occurred.
Statistical analysis
Statistical
analysis
of
the
clinical
(muscle
rigidity
scores) and neuronal (firing rate) placebo response
was performed by using mixed ANOVA (amplitude,
time, groups) followed by the post-hoc Bonferroni test
and multiple comparisons correction. Before performing
the ANOVA, we used Mauchly’s sphericity test to
verify that the variances of the differences between all
possible pairs of groups were equal. In no case was
sphericity violated. The values are expressed as the
clinical improvement (reduction in muscle rigidity), as
assessed by means of the UPDRS, at 5, 15, 30, 45 and
60 min after placebo. To do this, the differences between
pre-treatment and post-treatment (either apomorphine
or placebo) were calculated. Likewise, the differences
betweenpre-treatmentabout1hbeforeandpre-treatment
just before apomorphine or placebo administration was
calculated to assess possible natural changes before
treatment. All post-treatment conditions were compared
with the immediate pre-treatment measures. Neuronal
discharge was analysed in the same way by comparing
pre-treatment about 1 h before (during the first
implantation) and pre-treatment just before placebo
during the second implantation, which allowed us to
assess possible natural changes of neuron activity before

treatment.Then,analysisofneuronalactivityafterplacebo
was performed. Again, all post-treatment conditions were
compared with the immediate pre-treatment measures.
Theneuronalvaluesareexpressedasthepercentagechange
in firing rate. The number of bursting and non-bursting
neurons before and after placebo was compared by means
of the chi-square (χ2) test. In addition, linear regression
analysis was performed to assess possible correlations
between the number of apomorphine administrations
and the magnitude (peak response) and duration of the
placebo responses.
Results
The number of neurons recorded before placebo and at
different time intervals after placebo is shown in Table 2.
No differences were found in the number of neurons with
bursting activity (shown in parentheses) before and after
placebo. By contrast, significant differences were related to
both clinical improvement (reduction in muscle rigidity)
and firing rate of the thalamic neurons. The baseline firing
rates (mean ± SD) were the same across the different
groups (No treatment: 30.1 ± 14.7 Hz; Placebo 0: 27.5
± 11.9 Hz; Placebo 1: 28.4 ± 18 Hz; Placebo 2: 25.8 ±
15.3 Hz; Placebo 3: 30.7 ± 12.8 Hz; Placebo 4: 27
± 15.6 Hz).
Overall, by increasing the number of pre-operative
administrations of apomorphine (Fig. 3), there was a
significant increase in both the clinical (black circles)
and the neuronal (grey columns) placebo responses
(F25,180 = 8.2824, P < 0.001 and F20,144 = 8.8491,
P < 0.001, respectively, by ANOVA). Post-hoc Bonferroni
analysis showed that there were no significant differences
in muscle rigidity (black circles), as assessed through
the UPDRS, and in neuronal firing rate (grey columns)
between the no-treatment group (Fig. 3A) and the Placebo
0 (Fig. 3B) and Placebo 1 (Fig. 3C) groups. Therefore,
neither a placebo given for the first time (Placebo 0)
nor a placebo after a single exposure to apomorphine
(Placebo1)producedanyeffectattheclinicalandneuronal
level.
When the placebo was given after two pre-operative
administrations of apomorphine (Fig. 3D), the clinical
response was significantly different from the no-treatment
group at 5 min (P < 0.001 by Bonferroni post-hoc) and
15 min (P < 0.001) after placebo administration, and
the neuronal response was significantly different from the
no-treatment group at 15 min (P < 0.005). By increasing
the pre-operative apomorphine exposures up to three
(Fig. 3E), the clinical placebo response was significant at 5,
15, 30 and 45 min (P < 0.001 in all cases) and the neuro-
nal placebo response at 15, 30 and 45 min (P < 0.001 in
all cases). A further increase occurred by increasing the
pre-operative apomorphine administrations up to four
(Fig. 3F), which produced a clinical placebo response at 5,
15, 30, 45 and 60 min (P < 0.001 in all cases), and a neuro-
nal placebo response at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min (P < 0.001
in all cases).
Therefore, the greater the number of pre-operative
exposures to apomorphine, the larger the magnitude
and the longer the duration of the clinical and neuro-
nal placebo responses. In fact, a linear regression
analysis showed a positive correlation between the
number of pre-operative apomorphine administrations
and the magnitude of both the clinical and the neuro-
nal response (r = 0.8243, R2 = 0.6795, t33 = 8.364,
P < 0.001, and r = 0.8002, R2 = 0.6403, t33 = 7.666,
P < 0.001, respectively), as shown in Fig. 4A. Likewise,
a positive correlation was found between the number
of pre-operative apomorphine administrations and the
duration of the clinical/neuronal response (r = 0.9574,
R2 = 0.9167, t3 = 5.744, P < 0.015), as shown in Fig. 4B.
All
these
clinical
placebo
responses
disappeared
completely at 24 and 48 h, with the exception of the
Placebo 4 group (Fig. 5). In fact, a decrease in muscle
rigidity after placebo administration was still present at
24 h after surgery. The overall effect showed a significant
difference across groups (F25,180 = 3.1562, P < 0.001 by
ANOVA). This was attributable to a placebo response at
30minafterplaceboadministrationinthePlacebo4group
(P<0.001byBonferronipost-hoc).Thiseffectdisappeared
completely after 48 h.
Discussion
The main findings of the present study can be summarized
as follows. First, when a placebo was administered for the
first time, neither clinical responses nor neuronal changes
were observed, thus indicating that verbal suggestions
of improvement are ineffective in inducing biological
changes in the patient’s brain. Second, as the number of
prior exposures to apomorphine increased, both clinical
andneuronalresponsestoplaceboincreased,thusshowing
the crucial role of learning in clinical/biological placebo
responsiveness. Third, only four preoperative exposures
to apomorphine induced long-lasting changes up to 24 h.
In fact, the re-exposure to a placebo induced a placebo
response 24 h after surgery in group Placebo 4.
Taken together, these data demonstrate that the neuro-
nal changes induced by placebos in the patient’s brain
and previously described in other studies (Benedetti et al.
2004, 2009; Frisaldi et al. 2014) can be obtained only
after pharmacological preconditioning. In particular, in
the present study we found that placebos can mimic the
clinical effect of apomorphine. In fact, it should be noted
that placebo administration following four apomorphine
preconditioning trials induced clinical responses that were
as large as those to apomorphine (Fig. 3F). Unfortunately,
we do not know whether placebos also mimicked the
neuronal responses to apomorphine, as no apomorphine

Figure 3. Comparisons across the six groups for both clinical and electrophysiological data
Arm rigidity (black circles) is expressed as clinical improvement of rigidity score (vertical bars represent standard
deviations), on the basis of a rigidity scale ranging from 0 = no rigidity to 3 = severe rigidity. Thalamic neuron
activity (grey columns) is expressed as the percentage increase in firing rate after placebo administration (vertical
bars = standard deviations). Note that in group Placebo 4, after four preoperative exposures to apomorphine
(APO), the clinical response to placebo (on arm rigidity) was as large as the response to apomorphine, along with
substantial neuron activity changes (grey columns).

was given intra-operatively while recording from single
neurons.
The mechanism underlying this enhancement of the
placebo response following multiple exposures to apo-
morphine could be represented by classical conditioning.
The ritual of the subcutaneous injection, acting as
a conditioned stimulus (CS), associated several times
with apomorphine delivery, acting as the unconditioned
stimulus (US), leads to a conditioned response (CR),
whereby the subcutaneous injection ritual alone is capable
of inducing the same unconditioned response (UR) of
apomorphine (i.e. muscle rigidity reduction), along with
the increase in thalamic neuronal activity. Whether this
is true Pavlovian conditioning or rather an enhancement
of expectations, according to more recent cognitive inter-
pretations of classical conditioning (Reiss 1980; Rescorla

1988; Kirsch et al. 2004), cannot be resolved by the pre-
sent study. Nor can this study explain the mechanism of
the disappearance of the placebo response after 48 h.
For example, this could be due to either the repeated
administration of placebo (e.g. at 24 h) or to an effect
of time. This represents a crucial point that needs to be
addressed in future research, to better understand whether
the placebo response can be prolonged beyond 48 h.
Apomorphine has been found to produce either no
change in STN mean frequency discharge (Levy et al.
2001) or a pronounced decrease (Stefani et al. 2002).
Although our study is on the thalamus and not on STN, it
supportstheassociationbetweentheclinicalimprovement
in Parkinsonian rigidity and the increase in neuronal
activity in thalamic VA and VLa nuclei, which strengthens
the pathophysiological model in which the hyperactivity
of STN leads to inhibition of thalamic neurons via the sub-
stantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) (Bergman et al. 1994;
Blandini et al. 2000; Frisaldi et al. 2014). According to
this model, an anti-Parkinson treatment would restore the
normal activity in STN (Limousin et al. 1998; Benazzouz
& Hallett, 2000), with the consequent decreased inhibition
over the thalamus. The increased output from the motor
thalamus would facilitate movement control by the motor
cortex.
Besides the frequency of discharge of different neuro-
nal populations, there is today compelling evidence
that synchronized activity between different regions
may be impaired in Parkinson’s disease (Brown, 2003).
For example, monkeys treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-
1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which represents an
experimental model of parkinsonism, show oscillations
below 30 Hz (Nini et al. 1995). Likewise, synchronization
of single neurons in both STN and internal globus pallidus
(GPi) at 11–30 Hz have been observed in Parkinson
patients during intra-operative recording (Levy et al. 2000,
2001, 2002). In addition, Parkinson patients treated with
levodopa show oscillations greater than 60 Hz between
STN, GPi and cortex (Brown et al. 2001; Williams et al.
2002).Allthesedataindicatethatproperfunctioningofthe
basal ganglia circuitry is not mediated only by the neuro-
nal frequency of discharge, but by oscillatory activitiy as
well (Brown, 2003).
Which pattern, frequency of discharge or oscillations,
is more important in the placebo response cannot be
resolved by our study, and this certainly represents a
challenge for future research. In fact, although we did
not find any change in bursting activity in the thalamic
neurons, it should be noted that we found only a
few bursting neurons. Therefore, a definitive conclusion
cannot be drawn. In addition, we do not know whether
bursting activity in other regions, such as the STN
(Benedetti et al. 2004), was affected by the different pre-
operative exposures to apomorphine, and this needs to be
further investigated in future research.

Due to the obvious ethical limitations when recording
intra-operatively, in the present study we recorded only
from the VA and VLa nuclei of the thalamus. Therefore,
we do not know whether the observed changes also took
place in other regions of the basal ganglia that are involved
in motor control, and whose impairment is known to
induce the parkinsonian symptoms (Garcia et al. 2005;
DeLong & Wichmann, 2007; Hammond et al. 2007).
In other words, the observed changes in the thalamus
could merely represent changes that actually took place
in other regions. These regions have been investigated in
detail both in animals and in humans (Albin et al. 1989;
DeLong, 1990; Benazzouz et al. 2000; Bolam et al. 2000;
Pollack, 2001; Maurice et al. 2003; Tai et al. 2003; Garcia
et al. 2005; Shi et al. 2006; DeLong & Wichmann, 2007;
Hammond et al. 2007; Maltete et al. 2007; Benarroch,
2008) and include STN, the major target for the surgical
treatment of Parkinson’s disease, the external globus
pallidus (GPe), GPi and SNr. The main reason why
our main target for single-neuron recording was only
the thalamus depends on the time constraints during
surgery. As the placebo-induced neuronal changes pre-
viously described (Benedetti et al. 2004, 2009; Frisaldi et al.
2014) support the model in which the thalamus receives
inhibitory input from SNr, and SNr receives excitatory
input from STN (Benazzouz et al. 2000; Maurice et al.
2003; Tai et al. 2003; Shi et al. 2006; Maltete et al. 2007),
in the present study we decided to record from thalamic
neurons only, thus overcoming the time limitations.
Another possible limitation of our study is related to
the identification of the thalamic VA and VLa neurons. In
fact, there is the possibility that some ‘thalamic’ neurons
may be actually dorsal Zi neurons, because the border
between these two regions is not always clear. However, as
described in the Methods, we paid particular attention to
recording from neurons at least 2 mm above the superior
STN border, thus ruling out fibres and cells in the Zi.
Finally, a further limitation is represented by the clinical
assessment of arm rigidity only, due to time limitations
during surgery. We decided to assess only wrist rigidity
because it has been shown to be a reliable clinical response
in our previous studies (Benedetti et al. 2004, 2009). If it
becomes possible to overcome the intra-operative ethical
constraints, future research should be aimed at assessing
other symptoms as well, such as bradykinesia and tremor.
By taking all these limitations into account, our
study emphasizes the importance of pharmacological
preconditioning in placebo responsiveness, as described
in several experimental models, such as pain, immune
responses and hormone secretion (Benedetti et al.
2003; Colloca & Benedetti, 2006; Pacheco-Lopez et al.
2006). In particular, our study suggests that placebo
non-responders can be turned into placebo responders
when a learning procedure is carried out. As the number of
pharmacological preconditioning exposures increases, the
placebo responses become more robust and long-lasting.
However, it should be acknowledged as a possible
limitation that we did not use a within-subject design,
whereby both a conditioning and a no-conditioning
condition were tested in the same individual. Therefore,
future studies should verify whether a Parkinson patient
not responding to a placebo can become a placebo
responder through a conditioning procedure. These
findings may have profound implications for neuro-
therapeutics. In fact, the alternate replacement of drugs
with placebos can be used in therapeutic protocols aimed
at reducing drug intake.
