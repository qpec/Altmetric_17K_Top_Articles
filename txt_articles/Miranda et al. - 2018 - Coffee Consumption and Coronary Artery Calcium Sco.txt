Background-—Available evidence for the relationship between coffee intake and subclinical atherosclerosis is limited and
inconsistent. This study aimed to evaluate the association between coffee consumption and coronary artery calcium (CAC) in ELSA-
Brasil (Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health).
Methods and Results-—This cross-sectional study is based on baseline data from participants of the ELSA-Brasil cohort. Only
participants living in S~
ao Paulo, Brazil, who underwent a CAC measurement (n=4426) were included. Coffee consumption was
collected using a food frequency questionnaire. CAC was detected with computed tomography and expressed as Agatston units.
CAC was further categorized as an Agatson score ≥100 (CAC ≥100). In multiple logistic regression analysis considering intake of
coffee and smoking status interaction, significant inverse associations were observed between coffee consumption (>3 cups/d)
and CAC≥100 (odds ratio [OR]: 0.85 [95% confidence interval, 0.58–1.24] for ≤1 cup/d; OR: 0.73 [95% confidence interval, 0.51–
1.05] for 1–3 cups/d; OR: 0.33 [95% confidence interval, 0.17–0.65] for >3 cups/d). Moreover, there was a statistically significant
interaction effect for coffee consumption and smoking status (P=0.028 for interaction). After stratification by smoking status, the
analysis revealed a lower OR of coronary calcification in never smokers drinking >3 cups/d (OR: 0.37 [95% confidence interval,
0.15–0.91]), whereas among current and former smokers, the intake of coffee was not significantly associated with coronary
calcification.
Conclusions-—Habitual consumption of >3 cups/d of coffee decreased odds of subclinical atherosclerosis among never
smokers. The consumption of coffee could exert a potential beneficial effect against coronary calcification, particularly in
nonsmokers. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e007155. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.007155.)

C
ardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading global
cause
of
death
from
noncommunicable
diseases,
accounting for 17.9 million deaths/y in 20151 and predicted
to rise to >23.6 million by 2030.2 From 2005 to 2013, the
number of disability-adjusted life-years increased for CVD.3
Reducing these numbers, with the consequent reduction in
morbidity and mortality related to CVD, has been a main
objective of public health policies worldwide.1
Lifestyle and dietary factors, such as a lack of physical
activity, excess body weight, smoking, excessive alcohol
intake, and unhealthy diet, are implicated in the etiology of
CVD.4,5 Coffee is one of the most popular and widely
consumed nonalcoholic beverages in the world, and its role in
CVD is still being debated and remains controversial.5–7 In
this context, some epidemiological studies suggested a
positive association between coffee consumption and risk of
CVD,8,9 whereas others reported no association6,10 or even an
inverse association.11–13
Coffee is a complex mixture of several compounds
including caffeine, minerals, fiber, and other biologically
active components, such as diterpene alcohols, cafestol and

harmful or beneficial cardiovascular effects.14
The presence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a well-
known and independent marker of subclinical atherosclerosis
and a good predictor of future risk of cardiovascular events
and all-cause mortality in individuals with no previous history
of CVD.15–17 The CAC detected by cardiac computed
tomography (CT) is an accurate noninvasive measurement
for atherosclerosis in coronary arteries.18,19 CAC provides
information on underlying pathologic changes in coronary
arteries, allowing for detailed assessment of the early stages
of CVD.20
Although the relationship between coffee consumption and
metabolic risk factors for CVD has been a topic of frequent
interest, few studies have determined whether coffee drinking
influences subclinical atherosclerosis. In fact, at this moment,
only 4 studies have investigated the relationship between
coffee consumption and CAC, with limited and inconsistent
results.21–24 Further investigation is needed regarding this
issue.
We aimed to evaluate the association between habitual
coffee consumption and subclinical atherosclerosis measured
as CAC during the baseline examination of middle-aged
participants in ELSA-Brasil (Brazilian Longitudinal Study of
Adult Health).

ELSA-Brasil is a cohort study designed to identify risk
factors for diabetes mellitus and CVD. Further details of the
study, including design, eligibility criteria, sources and meth-
ods of recruitment, and measurements obtained, have been
described
elsewhere.25,26
Briefly,
the
cohort
comprises
15 105 civil servants, aged 35 to 74 years at baseline, who
were sampled from universities located in 6 Brazilian cities
(Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, S~
ao
Paulo, and Vitoria).
Baseline assessment was conducted from August 2008
to December 2010 and consisted of �7-hour evaluation,
which included personal interviews conducted by trained
personnel. These interviews focused on sociodemographic
characteristics, health and medical history, occupational
exposure, family history of disease, reproductive health,
health care, psychosocial factors, body weight history and
body image, food consumption, smoking, alcohol consump-
tion, physical activity, medication use, cognitive function,
mental health, and clinical and laboratory measurements. In
addition, the participants at the ELSA-Brasil site in S~
ao
Paulo (n=5061) were invited to perform a CT examination to
quantify CAC.
For the current investigation, only participants of ELSA-
Brasil at the S~
ao Paulo Research Center who underwent CAC
determination (n=4549) were included. In addition, in the
present analysis, we excluded individuals with missing data at
baseline for coffee intake (n=2) and self-reported history of
CVD, defined as prior myocardial infarction, angina, stroke,
heart failure, or coronary revascularization (n=121). The final
study sample comprised 4426 individuals who underwent
CAC measurements and who did not fulfill exclusion criteria to
participate in this subset of the study.
The ELSA-Brasil protocol was approved at all 6 centers by
the institutional review boards addressing research in human
participants. All participants signed a written informed
consent form.
Assessment of Coffee Consumption
Dietary data were collected using a validated, semiquantita-
tive, 114-item food frequency questionnaire to provide
information on typical eating habits of participants (ie, foods
and drinks) in the 12 months before the baseline examination
of ELSA-Brasil. More details are available elsewhere.27 For the
assessment of habitual coffee intake, specifically, participants
were asked to provide both the typical frequency with which
they consumed coffee (“More than 3 times per day,” “2–3
Clinical perspective
What Is New?
• We observed that the association between coffee consump-
tion and coronary calcification was related to smoking
status.
• Drinking >3 cups/d of coffee was associated with lower
odds of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in never
smokers.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Based on our results and prior studies, consumption of
coffee could exert a potential beneficial effect against
coronary calcification and cardiovascular disease risk,
particularly in nonsmokers.
• It is possible that deleterious effects of smoking overwhelm
the benefits of coffee intake on early cardiovascular disease
injury, so this impact of coffee may occur only in people who
have never smoked.

 times per day,” “once a day,” “5–6 times per week,” “2–4 per
week,” “once a week,” “1–3 times a month” and “never or
almost never”) and the quantity of coffee consumed on each
occasion in relation to a reference cup size of 50 mL, which is
the household measure adopted in Brazil. Participants were
further asked to specify the type of coffee normally consumed
(filter, instant, espresso, moka pot), whether this coffee
contained caffeine (caffeinated or decaffeinated), and whether
additional items were typically added to the coffee (sugar,
artificial sweetener, none). Daily coffee consumption (mL/d)
was estimated and then classified into 4 categories (in cups/
d): never/almost never or ≤1, 1 to 3, or >3 cups/d. The never/
almost never category was used as the reference group.
The Food Frequency Questionnaire ELSA-Brasil used the
Nutrition Data System for Research software (University of
Minnesota), which is mainly based on data from the food
composition table published by the US Department for
Agriculture and the Tabela Brasileira de Composic
�~
ao de
Alimentos (http://www.unicamp.br/nepa/taco/) to obtain
the nutritional information of the 114 items listed in the food
frequency questionnaire, such as dietary nutrients, total
energy, and other food components.
CAC Measurement
The ELSA-Brasil participants from the S~
ao Paulo site under-
went noncontrast CT for CAC score evaluation.28,29 The scans
were performed using a 64-detector CT scanner (Brilliance 64;
Philips Healthcare). The field of view was set to include the
entire heart, and the z-axis direction included data from the
bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries to the apex of the heart
during an expiratory pause. The default settings included 120
kV, mA adjusted to body mass index, 1-phase prospective
acquisition at 70% (mid-diastole) of the cardiac cycle and
collimation of 2.5 mm, gantry rotation of 400 ms, and
reconstruction with a standard filter. CT images were
evaluated in blinded form by an experienced cardiologist
using a semiautomatic software (Calcium Scoring; Philips
Workstation). The measurement of the CAC score was
calculated using a threshold of 130 Hounsfield units and
expressed in Agatston units.30 CAC severity was further
categorized with a cutoff at 100 points because it is a better
marker of worse prognosis than CAC >0.31–33
Covariate Assessment
Each participant was interviewed at his or her workplace and
visited the research center for clinical examinations according
to standard protocols.34 Consequently, all covariates included
in this analysis were self-reported through standardized
questionnaires or obtained through clinical procedures or
laboratory examination measurements, performed by trained
personnel under strict quality control at ELSA-Brasil baseline
assessment.25,34,35
Sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics included
monthly family per capita income (in US dollars), educational
attainment, physical activity level, smoking status, alcohol
drinking habits, and use of medications. Current educational
attainment was assessed as the highest qualification attained
and categorized as undergraduate school or more, complete
high school, complete elementary school, and incomplete
elementary school. Physical activity included energy expendi-
ture in leisure time by reporting type and duration of activity
according to predetermined questionnaire items from the long
version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.36
The physical activity level was categorized as low, moderate
and high. Individuals were categorized according to smoking
status as never smoker, former smoker, and current smoker.
Never smoking status was defined as lifetime consumption of
<100 cigarettes (5 packs of cigarettes). Former smokers were
participants with past history of smoking who had not smoked
cigarettes within the previous 30 days. Current smoking was
defined as consumption of cigarettes within the previous
30 days. Average alcohol consumption was categorized as
nondrinker and alcohol drinker. Medicaments use included
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia
treatment.
Physical examination included measurement of height,
weight, and blood pressure using standard procedures. Body
mass index was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by the
square of height (m2), expressed as kg/m2. Blood pressure
was measured using a validated oscillometric device (Omron
HEM 705CP), handled by a nursing technician. Three
measurements were performed at 1-minute intervals. The
mean of the 2 latest blood pressure measurements was used
as the high blood pressure definition.34 Hypertension status
was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or
diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, use of antihypertensive
drug treatment, or both.37
The blood samples were collected by venipuncture after 12
hours of overnight fasting. All analyses were performed at the
University of S~
ao Paulo. Serum total cholesterol and fractions,
low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides
were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assay (ADVIA
1200 Chemistry Analyzer; Siemens). Fasting plasma glucose
was measured by hexokinase method (enzymatic; ADVIA
1200 Chemistry Analyzer; Siemens). Diabetes mellitus status
was defined as a medical history of diabetes mellitus with a
physician diagnosis and/or the reported use of medications
to treat diabetes mellitus (insulin or oral antidiabetic medi-
cation) and/or fasting plasma glucose >126 mg/dL, glycated
hemoglobin ≥6.5%, or 2-hour plasma glucose after an
overload of 75 g glucose in ≥200 mg/dL (5.17 mmol/L).26

Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics of the sample were summarized using
median and interquartile range for continuous variables and
frequencies and percentages for categorical variables accord-
ing to coffee consumption categories (never/almost never,
≤1, 1–3, and >3 cups/d). Differences between coffee
consumption categories were performed using the v2 test
for categorical variables and the Kruskall–Wallis test for
continuous variables.
Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to
estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)
for the association between the independent variable (cate-
gories of coffee consumption) and category of CAC score
(<100 versus ≥100), as the dependent variable. The effect of
interaction between smoking status and coffee consumption
on subclinical coronary calcification was tested by including
the respective multiplicative interaction terms in the logistic
regression model. Thereafter, the multivariate model was
adjusted for established risk factors for CVD that were also
known to be associated with coffee consumption based on
prior studies and theoretical considerations, according to the
literature, as follows: age (years), sex (male and female), self-
reported race/skin color (white and nonwhite), current
educational attainment (complete elementary school, com-
plete high school, and undergraduate school or more),
physical activity level (low, moderate, and high), body mass
index (kg/m2), smoking status (never, former, and current
smokers), alcohol consumption (nondrinker and drinker),
saturated fat (g/d), consumption of fruit and vegetables (g/
d), tea drinking (mL/d), total energy intake (kcal/d), blood
pressure (mm Hg), fasting glucose (mg/dL), high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(mg/dL),
low-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol (mg/dL), triglyceride (mg/dL), and use of antihy-
pertensive, antidiabetic, or cholesterol-lowering medications.
Because an interaction was found for smoking status
(P=0.028), the analysis was performed after stratification of
the sample by this variable.
All statistical analyses were conducted using the Stata
statistical software package, version 13.0 (StataCorp), and
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The P value
for trend of continuous variables using ANOVA was also
determined.
Results
The final study population had a median age of 50.0 years,
was mostly female (54.2%), was self-declared white (58.9%),
had a low physical activity level (78.7%), and was overweight
or obese (65.4%). Of the participants, 2360 were never
smokers (53.3%), 1356 were former smokers (30.7%), and
710 were current smokers (16.0%). The prevalence of CAC
≥100 was 9.9%. Most participants (�56%) reported consum-
ing coffee at least twice per day, with 515 (11.6% of the total)
reporting consuming coffee >3 times per day. Most partic-
ipants reported typically consuming coffee that was filtered
(81.7%) and caffeinated (98.6%) and using added sugar
(59.0%) or artificial sweetener (28.2%).
The baseline characteristics of the studied population
according to coffee consumption categories are shown in
Table 1. Coffee consumption was related to age, white race or
skin color, educational level, physical activity level, smoking
status, alcohol intake, tea consumption, fruit and vegetable
consumption, saturated fat, and total energy intake.
The association between coronary calcification and coffee
consumption categories, considering the coffee–smoking
interaction, is depicted in Table 2. After multivariate adjust-
ment, there was a statistically significant interaction effect for
coffee consumption and smoking status on CAC ≥100
(P=0.028 for interaction). Moreover, significant inverse asso-
ciation was observed between coffee consumption (>3 cups/
d) and CAC (≥100 Agatston units). The odds ratios for CAC
≥100 in participants who consumed coffee compared with
those who never drank coffee were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.58–1.24),
0.73 (95% CI, 0.51–1.05), and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.17–0.65) for
≤1, 1 to 3, and >3 cups/d (P=0.015 for trend). Table 3
presents the results of the stratified analysis according to
smoking status. The odds ratio of subclinical coronary
atherosclerosis among current and former smokers was not
significantly associated with coffee consumption, whereas
among never smokers, the intake of coffee up to 3 cups/d
was associated with lower odds of coronary calcification
(odds ratio: 0.37 [95% CI, 0.15–0.91]; P=0.036 for trend).
Discussion
The current study found that habitual coffee consumption was
inversely associated with coronary calcification, a marker of
subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, even after adjustments
for
potential
confounders,
including
cardiovascular
risk
factors; however, this protective role of coffee on coronary
calcification was nullified by smoking habit.
The benefits of coffee consumption on the cardiovascular
system have been investigated extensively, providing incon-
sistent and conflicting results according to different study
designs.5,6 In the 1980s, cross-sectional studies found a
positive association between coffee consumption and serum
total cholesterol concentrations, which might be related to
the coffee-brewing method (ie, boiled or unfiltered coffee).

Coffee Consumption and Coronary Artery Calcium
Miranda et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 Case–control studies, which are prone to recall and selection
biases, tended to show a positive association, whereas cohort
studies generally suggested a null association, although
results varied substantially across studies and findings have
remained inconsistent.12
More recent meta-analysis of prospective studies showed
that moderate coffee consumption was associated with
decreased
CVD
risk,
all-cause
mortality,
and
mortality
attributed to CVD and neurologic disease in the overall
population. High coffee consumption (>5 cups/d) was neither
related to CVD risk nor to risk of mortality.12,13 To corroborate
this evidence, the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Amer-
icans show that consumption of 3 to 5 cups/d of coffee is
associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and
CVD in adults.38 Consequently, moderate coffee consumption
can be incorporated into a healthy dietary pattern, along with
other healthful behaviors.38
Although coffee consumption has been studied in relation
to various risk factors of CVD, only 4 studies have investi-
gated the association between coffee intake and subclinical
atherosclerosis,21–24 and the data available were limited and
inconsistent.
According to Choi et al,23 in the large sample of Korean
men and women apparently free of clinically evident CVD
(n=25 138), moderate coffee consumption (3 to <5 cups/d)
was associated with 41% lower prevalence of CAC. The results
from our study are comparable to this research. In the study
by Choi et al, however, the average age of the study
participants was 41 years, 84% of the participants were male,
and �82% completed college graduation or higher, thus the
results might not be generalizable to the other populations. In
the Rotterdam study (n=1570), van Woudenbergh et al21
showed that moderate (>3 to 4 cups/d) to high (>4 cups/d)
coffee consumption was associated with decreased preva-
lence of severe calcification (CAC score >400) in women, but
an increased risk was observed in nonsmoking men. These
investigators were unable to explain why coffee appeared to
be protective among women but harmful among nonsmoking
men. Smoking behavior may wield a strong influence on an
association between coffee consumption and CVD risk.
Smokers are often more frequent coffee drinkers,39 and they
are also inherently at greater risk of coronary artery disease39
and positively associated with subclinical atherosclerosis.40,41
Smoking may also intercede in the pathways through which
coffee constituents are hypothesized to mediate effects on
this disease. If caffeine and coffee-derived antioxidants are
important mediators of the association between coffee
consumption and subclinical atherosclerosis, it is possible
that deleterious effects of smoking overwhelm the influence
of coffee intake on early CVD injury. Consequently, this
impact of coffee may only be detectable in people who have
never smoked. In stratified analysis, we are able to remove

therefore, our results support the evidence that the beneficial

observed only in never smokers.
Contrary to our findings, 2 other studies22,24 have shown that
there was no association between habitual coffee consumption
and coronary atherosclerosis in adults. In the CARDIA (Coronary

Coffee Consumption and Coronary Artery Calcium
Miranda et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption was not
associated with coronary calcification or with progression over
5 years of follow-up. Participants in the CARDIA study were
younger (mean age: 26 years) and consumed less coffee (16%
reported consuming ≥3 cups/d). In the NHLBI Family Heart
Study (n=1929),24 prevalence ratios for CAC ≥100 were 1.0
(reference), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.57–1.49), 1.34 (95% CI, 0.86–2.08),
1.30 (95% CI, 0.84–2.02), and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.60–1.64) for
coffee consumption of almost never, <1, 1, 2 to 3, and ≥4 cups/
d, respectively, in adult men and women.
These controversial findings across studies could also be
attributable to different types of studies and methodological
issues,
including
differences in
sample
size,
statistical
adjustments for potential confounding factors, measures
and different coffee-brewing methods, daily consumption,
distinct
characteristics
of
study populations
(age, sex,
ethnicity, educational level), and prevalence of CAC.
Regarding the biological mechanisms, several pathways
have been suggested for the potential beneficial relationship
between coffee consumption and cardiovascular risk. It might
be possible that the protective effect of coffee consumption
comes through different physiology that reduces the long-
term effects of traditional risk factors responsible for CVD.
Habitual coffee consumption has been associated with a
significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus,42,43 a
major risk factor for atherosclerosis. In addition, coffee
drinking might improve insulin sensitivity, apparently because
of the presence of antioxidant compounds in the coffee.44
Despite the fact that acute coffee consumption might
increase blood pressure, this effect seems to disappear with
long-term coffee consumption, and large prospective studies
do not support the hypothesis that high coffee consumption
increases the risk of hypertension.45,46 Coffee is a beverage
with very complex chemical composition, rich in phenolic
compounds, predominantly hydroxycinnamic acids, which
demonstrate protective roles in the cardiovascular system.4
This cardiovascular protection has been confirmed in vivo and
can be explained by various mechanisms, including their anti-
inflammatory properties,47 strong antioxidant activity48,49 that
might
prevent
low-density
lipoprotein
oxidation,49
and
antithrombotic capacities associated with improved endothe-
lial function and nitric oxide bioavailability,50,51 protecting
against thrombus formation or atherosclerotic lesion devel-
opment. Conversely, coffee, particularly unfiltered coffee, has
been associated with alterations in circulating lipids, because
it is rich in cholesterol-raising compounds (diterpenes,
kahweol, and cafestol) that contribute significantly to the
increase in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol, and triglycerides.52–54 Consumption of filtered coffee,
however, had no substantial effects on blood lipids,52,55
because the brewing releases oil droplets containing diterpe-
nes from ground coffee beans, and the oil is retained by a
paper filter.52,54 In Brazil, filtering is the traditional method of
coffee preparation, so our study corroborated and supported
this information. Besides, the antioxidants included in coffee
might reduce lipid oxidation, as mentioned earlier.
Some limitations of this study should be considered when
interpreting results. Although ELSA-Brasil is a prospective
cohort study, at this moment, we only have available data from
the baseline examination; therefore, the cross-sectional design
limits the possibility of establishing causal inferences, because
we cannot rule out reverse causation or residual confounding.
Nevertheless, to minimize the problem of reverse causality, we
excluded participants with previously diagnosed CVD from the
analyses. Finally, our results were based on a sample of
relatively healthy middle-aged participants with a high educa-
tional level, thus they might not be generalizable to other
populations. Further research is warranted to confirm our
findings and to establish the biological basis of coffee’s
potential preventive effects on coronary artery disease.
Our study, however, has several strengths. The large
sample size provides sufficient power to detect the associ-
ation between coffee drinking and CAC scores while control-
ling for several potential confounders. Data collection in
ELSA-Brasil is subject to carefully standardized protocols and
rigorous quality control. In addition, we had information on a
large number of CVD risk factors that could be used to adjust
for potential confounders in multivariable models. Moreover,
we
used
the
CAC
measurement
to
assess
coronary
atherosclerosis, a method with good reproducibility and
correlation with the extent of coronary artery disease.
In conclusion, the current study showed that the associ-
ation between coffee consumption and coronary calcification
was related to smoking status. Habitual coffee drinking of >3
cups/d was associated with lower odds of subclinical
coronary atherosclerosis among never smokers in a Brazilian
population. Our findings suggest that coffee consumption
could exert a potential beneficial effect against coronary
calcification and CVD risk, particularly in nonsmokers.
