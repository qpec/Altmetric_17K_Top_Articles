ABSTRACT
Background The UK Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS)
trial is a randomised pilot trial of low-dose CT (LDCT)
screening for individuals at high risk of lung cancer. We
assessed the long-term psychosocial impact on
individuals participating in the UKLS trial.
Methods A random sample of individuals aged
50–75 years was contacted via primary care. High-risk
individuals who completed T0 questionnaires (baseline)
were randomised to LDCT screening (intervention) or
usual care (no screening control). T1 questionnaires were
sent 2 weeks after baseline scan results or control
assignment. T2 questionnaires were sent up to 2 years
after recruitment. Measures included cancer distress,
anxiety, depression and decision satisfaction.
Results A total of 4037 high-risk individuals were
randomised and they completed T0 questionnaires
(n=2018 intervention, n=2019 control). Cancer distress
was higher at T1 in intervention arm participants who
received positive screening results (p≤0.001), but not at
T2 (p=0.04). T2 anxiety (p≤0.001) and depression
(p≤0.01) were higher in the control arm, but the
absolute differences were small and not clinically
relevant. At both time points, fewer control than
screened participants were satisfied with their decision
to participate in UKLS (p≤0.001). Regardless of trial
allocation, cancer distress was higher in women
(p≤0.01), participants aged ≤65 years (p≤0.001),
current smokers (p≤0.001), those with lung cancer
experience (p≤0.001) and those recruited from the
Liverpool area (p≤0.001).
Conclusion Lung cancer screening using LDCT appears
to have no clinically significant long-term psychosocial
impact on high-risk participants. Strategies for engaging
and supporting underserved groups are the key to
implement routine lung cancer screening in the UK.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality in the UK.1 Although improving, the
5-year survival rate for lung cancer in the UK is
approximately 10% and lower than in other coun-
tries with comparable healthcare systems.2 This is
partly due to patients presenting at an advanced
disease stage, with over 65% of cases diagnosed at
stage III or stage IV3 when treatment is usually
palliative.
Effective early detection strategies are critical for
enabling earlier diagnosis, curative treatment and
better lung cancer prognosis. Lung cancer screening
using low-dose CT (LDCT) in high-risk groups has
demonstrated a 20% relative reduction in lung
cancer mortality compared with chest X-ray in the
US
National
Lung
Screening
Trial
(NLST).4
However, false-positive rates of 20%–50% have
been reported.4 5 Policy decisions about whether to
implement a new screening technology require evi-
dence regarding psychosocial consequences that
may influence successful application in routine
practice.
Previous controlled trials have reported the psy-
chosocial effects of LDCT lung cancer screening.
The
Danish
Lung
Cancer
Screening
Trial
(DLCST)6
7 and Dutch-Belgian NELSON trial8
found no differential effect of trial allocation on a
range of psychosocial outcomes at 1 and 2 years
follow-up, respectively. T
emporary adverse effects
of receiving abnormal results have been observed in
high-risk participants randomised to LDCT screen-
ing.9–11 The NELSON trial reported poorer quality
of life and increased anxiety and cancer distress at
Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ What is the long-term psychosocial impact on
high-risk individuals taking part in a UK
randomised pilot trial of low-dose CT lung
screening?
What is the bottom line?
▸ Low-dose CT screening appears to have no
clinically significant psychosocial impact on
high-risk participants in the long term, but
subgroups including women, younger
participants, smokers, those with experience of
lung cancer and those living in deprived areas
may require targeted information and support.
Why read on?
▸ The evidence will contribute to clinical and
policy decisions regarding the successful and
equitable implementation of low-dose CT lung
screening for high-risk individuals in the UK.

 2 months follow-up in recipients of an indeterminate scan
result.11 However, these effects had diminished at 6 months
follow-up.8 Recently, the NLST reported no significant differ-
ences between those receiving an abnormal and those receiving
normal lung screening result in anxiety and health-related
quality of life at 1 and 6 months follow-up.12
The UK Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) pilot trial is the first to
assess the feasibility, cost-effectiveness and psychosocial impact
of lung cancer screening using a single LDCT screen versus no
screening in a UK high-risk population.13 When considering the
impact of lung cancer screening, it is important to understand
the moderating role of participant characteristics that could
present
barriers
to
successful
implementation.
For
example, smokers may perceive few benefits of screening14 15
and harbour fatalistic and avoidant beliefs about lung cancer16–18
compared
with
former
or
non-smokers.
Individuals
from
poorer backgrounds may be less enthusiastic about screening and
face more barriers than those from affluent backgrounds.19 In
earlier UKLS reports, trial participation was less likely in
smokers, women, older age groups, those with higher levels of
concern about lung cancer and those in lower socioeconomic
groups.20 21
W
e report the effects of UKLS trial participation on short-
term
and
long-term
psychosocial
outcomes.
The
primary
hypothesis was that intervention arm participants—in particular
those with a positive (ie, abnormal) baseline scan result—would
report higher short-term cancer distress compared with those in
the control arm, but there would be no differential effects of
trial arm or screening outcome on long-term distress. In second-
ary analyses of outcomes adjusted for a range of covariates, it
was anticipated that subgroups including smokers and those
from socioeconomically deprived areas would report adverse
long-term outcomes regardless of trial allocation or result.
METHODS
Participants and procedures
A random sample of 247 354 individuals aged 50–75 years res-
iding
in
six
recruitment
centres
at
two
sites
(Liverpool,
Knowsley
and
Sefton;
Cambridgeshire,
Peterborough
and
Bedfordshire) was sent trial information packs that included a
questionnaire regarding lung cancer risk factors. From the ques-
tionnaire responders, 8729 patients were identified as having
high risk of lung cancer (≥5% over 5 years) using the LLPv2 risk
prediction model.13 Characteristics of trial non-participants are
reported elsewhere.20 21
Following completion of a further questionnaire to identify
trial eligibility, those meeting the criteria were invited to attend
their local recruitment centre in the Liverpool or Cambridge
area. High-risk individuals who gave informed written consent
were randomly allocated by simple computer pseudo-random
number generation to the intervention (LDCT) or control arms
in a 1:1 ratio.13
Participants
completed
a
touchscreen
questionnaire
that
included baseline psychosocial measures (T0). A second psycho-
social questionnaire (T1) was sent approximately 2 weeks after
receiving either a letter of assignment to the control group or a
baseline CT scan result letter (intervention arm). T2 psychosocial
questionnaires were sent in a single mailshot during January
2014.
Measures
Primary outcome: lung cancer distress was measured using the
six-item Cancer W
orry Scale22 23 anchored to thoughts and feel-
ings about lung cancer during the past week. The scale had
good internal consistency (α>0.81). Total score range was 6–24,
with a score above 12.5 corresponding to a clinically significant
threshold score on the General Health Questionnaire-28.24
Secondary outcomes: anxiety and depression were measured
using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.25 Anxiety and
depression subscales include seven items on a 0–3 scale,
anchored to how participants felt in the last week (score range
0–21) and with good internal consistency (α>0.73). Scores of
0–7 are classified as ‘normal’, 8–10 as ‘mild’ anxiety or depres-
sion and 11–14 and 15–21 as ‘moderate’ and ‘severe’, respect-
ively.25 Decision satisfaction was assessed with the six-item
Satisfaction with Decision Scale.26 Scores were calculated and
averaged so that possible scores ranged from 1 to 5 (α>0.94).
Due to bi-modal distribution in the present study, a binary vari-
able was created to reflect lower decision satisfaction (score <5,
‘not very satisfied’) and higher decision satisfaction (score=5,
‘very satisfied’).
Demographic variables: age and gender were obtained from
medical
records.
Participants
were
identified
as
current,
ex-smokers or never-smokers using self-reported smoking status
included in the UKLS risk questionnaire. Socioeconomic depriv-
ation was measured using Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)
scores calculated from postcodes and ranked into standard
deprivation
quintiles
(quintile
1=most
deprived,
quintile
5=least deprived). Educational attainment, marital group, ethni-
city and experience of lung cancer (self and/or close others)
were included in the T0 questionnaire.
Screening results
As shown in figure 1, at T1, we categorised baseline CT scan
results into those that required a repeat scan in 3 or 12 months
(positive for repeat scan) or referral to the multidisciplinary
team (MDT) due to a major lung abnormality (positive for
MDT referral), normal (negative) and significant incidental find-
ings such as aortic aneurisms and pneumonia but with no find-
ings suspicious for lung cancer (incidental finding). Categorising
baseline CT scan results as ‘positive for repeat scan’ at T1

 enabled comparison of the short-term responses of participants
whose initial screening results were not unequivocally normal/
negative. At T2, we distinguished screening outcome for partici-
pants with a positive baseline screening result who were free
from lung cancer (false-positive) from those who did have lung
cancer (true-positive) at long-term follow-up, those with normal
results (true-negative) and those with significant abnormalities
during baseline or repeat CT scan that were not lung cancer
(incidental finding).
Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted using SPSS (V
.20; SPSS, Chicago,
Illinois, USA). Mean replacement imputation within domains
was used and a complete case analysis was carried out.
Individuals with missing data >35% within a domain were not
included in the analysis. Attrition bias was assessed using χ2 and
independent t tests. During primary analysis, psychosocial out-
comes of trial allocation and screening results at T1 and T2 were
assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for T0
scores or χ2 tests. Due to non-normality and heterogeneity of
regression slopes for T1 cancer distress scores, analyses of trial
allocation effect on the primary outcome were conducted separ-
ately for log-transformed (logn) high and low cancer distress
thresholds, that is, above or below 12.5.24 Sensitivity analyses
were conducted to assess possible confounding effects of data
timing issues and to adjust for missing follow-up data at T1 and
T2 using an inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach.27
The p values ≤0.01 were used to denote statistical significance
in
the
context
of
multiple
testing.
Following
significant
ANCOVA results, post-hoc pairwise comparisons of screening
results were performed (p≤0.05).
A secondary linear mixed-effects risk prediction model was
generated to evaluate the impact of trial allocation on the
primary outcome of cancer distress at T1 and T2 in (1) uni-
variable regression analyses adjusting for T0 distress scores
and (2) multivariable regression analyses adjusting for T0
scores and all other main effects (gender, age group, smoking,
deprivation quintile, education, ethnicity, marital group, lung
cancer experience, trial site and time since attended recruit-
ment centre). The model fitting process included mechanistic-
ally
plausible
confounders
that
exhibited
independent
associations in a forward-stepping method using the likeli-
hood ratio statistic (p≤0.01), as part of an a priori statistical
analysis
plan.
Since
only
intervention
group
participants
received a CT scan, trial allocation group was fully nested
with the result group.

 RESULTS
Trial participation
In total, 4061 individuals (5.3% of 75 958 responders to the risk
questionnaire; 46.5% of all high-risk positive responders) attended
the recruitment clinic and were consented (see figure 2). Of these,
4037 trial participants completed T0 questionnaires and were ran-
domised (n=2018 intervention, n=2019 control), of whom 3232
completed
T1
questionnaires
(n=1653/84%
intervention,
n=1579/78% control). At T2, 2855 participants completed ques-
tionnaires (n=1553/82% intervention, n=1302/65% control).
The mean time of T2 questionnaire completion was 16 months
after attending the recruitment centre (range 10–29 months).
Factors associated with study attrition
As shown in tables 1 and 2, intervention participants were statis-
tically significantly more likely than those in the control arm to
complete T1 and T2. Questionnaire completers at T1 and T2
were significantly more likely to be older, male, married or
cohabiting, more educated, former smokers, resident in the
Cambridge area and those who have had no experience of lung
cancer. Due to missing data for educational level, results for this
variable should be interpreted with caution. A significantly
greater proportion of questionnaire completers were in the
highest IMD quintile at T1 and T2. T1 and T2 completers
reported
significantly
lower

very small and scores were in the low range overall. Differences
in decision satisfaction were not statistically significant at either
follow-up.
Baseline sample characteristics
Most trial participants were male, white, married or cohabiting,
former smokers, with an average age of 68 years (see table 3).
Of those for whom educational data were available, just over
half the participants were educated beyond 16 years. There was
a spread of deprivation levels within the sample, with approxi-
mately one-quarter in the highest quintile and one-quarter in
the lowest quintile. T0 cancer distress, anxiety and depression
scores were equivalent across trial arms. Approximately 40%
were very satisfied with their decision to take part. The baseline
characteristics of participants who were included in T1 and T2
analyses are presented in additional online supplementary tables
SI and SII.

Short-term (T1) outcomes
As shown in table 4, different effects of trial allocation on T1
cancer distress were found in participants who scored above and
below the T0 distress threshold (12.5). For those with low T0

 distress (n=2896/3225, 90%), T1 distress scores were signifi-
cantly higher in the intervention arm, though not to clinical
levels and with a very small effect size (logn (Int-Con)=0.03,
95% CI 0.02 to 0.05). For those with high T0 distress (n=326/
3225, 10%), the effect of trial allocation on T1 cancer distress
was not significant: mean levels of cancer distress remained high
and bordered on clinical levels regardless of trial allocation
(153/326=47%) (logn (Int-Con)=−0.04, 95% CI −0.09 to
0.01).
The effect of trial allocation on T1 general anxiety was not
statistically significant (logn (Int-Con)=−0.02, 95% CI −0.06 to
0.02). Higher logn depression scores were found in the control
group,
but
the
absolute
difference
was
very
small
(logn
(Int-Con)=−0.08, 95% CI −0.12 to −0.04). When converted
back to the original scale (0–21 range), depression scores were
within the normal range for both groups. At T1, a significantly
greater proportion of control arm participants were not very sat-
isfied with their decision to take part (66%) compared with the
intervention arm (58%) (p≤0.001). Sensitivity analyses to assess
the impact of data timing showed no change in statistical signifi-
cance levels; therefore, further exclusions were not made.
Further adjustment for missing data using IPW indicated no
change in the direction, magnitude or significance of the differ-
ence in cancer distress between intervention and control arms
for either low or high scorers.
Intervention participants who were positive for MDT referral
at T1 reported statistically significantly higher T1 cancer distress
which approached clinical thresholds (p≤0.001) compared with
those
with
negative
results
(p≤0.001),
incidental
findings
(p≤0.001) and those positive for a repeat scan (p≤0.001).
Participants who required a repeat scan at T1 reported signifi-
cantly higher T1 cancer distress than those with negative results
(p≤0.001). Statistically significantly greater anxiety was found
in participants referred to MDT (p≤0.001) compared with
those receiving negative results (p≤0.001), incidental findings
(p=0.02) or positive for repeat scan (p=0.003), although
scores were in the low/normal range. The difference in anxiety
between those positive for MDT referral and those with inciden-
tal findings disappeared when sensitivity analysis accounted for
test timing issues. Differences in depression scores were not stat-
istically significant for any screening result group (p=0.35).
Intervention participants who were positive for a repeat scan
were the least satisfied with their decision (p≤0.001).
Long-term (T2) outcomes
The effect of trial allocation on T2 cancer distress was not statis-

95% CI −0.01 to 0.02) or high (logn (Int-Con)=−0.02, 95% CI
−0.09 to 0.05) T0 distress (see table 5). Although the control
group reported significantly higher

logn
anxiety (logn
(Int-Con)=−0.08, 95% CI −0.12 to −0.03) and depression
(logn (Int-Con)=−0.06, 95% CI −0.10 to −0.02), the absolute
differences between trial arms were small and not clinically sig-
nificant. When converted to raw scores, all three measures for
both trial arms were within the normal range. Control partici-
pants (74%) were significantly less likely than intervention parti-
cipants (60%) to be very satisfied with their decision to take
part (p≤0.001).
Differences between screening outcome groups in T2 cancer
distress (p=0.04), anxiety (p=0.12), depression (p=0.11) and
decision satisfaction (p=0.03) were not statistically significant.
The raw scores of all psychosocial variables in all screening
outcome groups were within the normal range and not clinically
relevant. Sensitivity analyses using IPW to assess the impact of
missing data indicated no change in the direction, magnitude or
significance of the difference in cancer distress between inter-
vention and control arms, either for low or high baseline
scorers.
Secondary analyses
In univariable analyses, the mean difference in logn cancer dis-
tress scores between the intervention and control arms was not
statistically significant after adjustment for T0 cancer distress
and independent effect modifiers (see table 6). This equated to
a relative increase of 2% for intervention arm participants when

 distress scores were back-transformed (95% CI 12% to 17%).
Cancer distress scores were statistically significantly higher in
women (p≤0.001), younger participants (≤65 years and 66–
70 years) compared with those aged over 70 (p≤0.001), current
smokers compared with ex-smokers (p≤0.001), lower socio-
economic groups (Q1-Q2 vs Q5 p≤0.001, Q3 vs Q5 p≤0.01),
single

compared
with

individuals
(p≤0.001), those with experience of lung cancer (p≤0.001) and
participants recruited from the Liverpool area (p≤0.001).
Education, ethnicity and time since recruitment were not signifi-
cantly
independently
associated
with
cancer
distress.
Intervention participants who needed a repeat scan or MDT
referral reported higher cancer distress than those who received
a negative result (p≤0.001).
In multivariable analyses adjusting for covariates, the impact
of trial allocation on cancer distress was not statistically signifi-
cant. Higher cancer distress was statistically significantly asso-
ciated with female gender (p≤0.01), younger age group (≤65 vs
over 70 years) (p≤0.001), current smoking status (p≤0.001),
lung cancer experience (p≤0.001) and Liverpool recruitment
site (p≤0.001).
Sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of T0 cancer distress
level indicated a similar pattern of results for participants with
high T0 cancer distress levels.

 DISCUSSION
The present study is the first to report the long-term psycho-
social impact of LDCT screening in a UK high-risk population.
Transient negative consequences were observed in individuals
allocated to LDCT screening and in those who received
unfavourable
screening
results,
but
these
differences
were
neither sustained over time nor clinically significant. However, a
profile of risk factors emerged for adverse consequences of par-
ticipating in lung cancer screening.
The overall findings confirm evidence from non-UK con-
trolled trials that allocation to LDCT screening does not appear
to produce long-term anxiety or other adverse effects that could
potentially deter high-risk individuals from future adherence to
lung screening. In studies with repeated screening such as NLST
,
the majority of participants returned for further screenings.4
NELSON8 and PLCO9 observed minimal long-term psycho-
social effects of LDCT screening. Although UKLS participants
who were assigned to the control group reported slightly higher
long-term anxiety and depression, the absolute differences were
very small and not clinically significant. This finding may reflect
unscreened participants’ disappointment or frustration at having
been identified as high risk but denied the opportunity to gain
reassurance from screening, supported by the finding that a
greater proportion were less satisfied with their decision to par-
ticipate compared with the intervention arm. Similarly, the
DLCST reported negative consequences in the unscreened
control arm at 16 and 2 years.7
The short-term impact of UKLS participation largely reflected
temporary adverse effects of positive screening results, which
disappeared by 2 years follow-up. This finding supports previ-
ous LDCT trials that indicate long-term resolution of adverse
screening effects.8 9 11 Unsurprisingly, participants who were
referred due to a suspected major lung abnormality reported
higher short-term cancer distress than any other screening result
group, with levels close to threshold scores. Those who required
a repeat scan reported higher distress than those receiving an
immediate ‘all-clear’ result. Higher short-term anxiety was
observed in participants with a suspected major lung abnormal-
ity, but scores were within the normal range and they were also
more at ease with their decision to take part in the trial. The
latter finding has been reported in other screening evaluation
studies, suggesting decision consolidation and the perception
that further diagnostic tests have been carried out thoroughly
and for personal benefit.28

W
omen may feel more worried and less prepared for the pros-
pect of lung cancer screening than men, possibly due to expos-
ure to female cancer screening programmes and perceptions of
lung cancer as a traditionally male disease. Smokers and those
who had been exposed to lung cancer in their social networks
were also more concerned about lung cancer. Perceived stigma
and fatalism surrounding a lung cancer diagnosis are important
issues, especially for smokers.14 16 17 This may be partly due to
adverse vicarious experiences (ie, witnessing poor outcomes in
family and friends with lung cancer) that influence the forma-
tion of negative beliefs and attitudes towards lung cancer screen-
ing. The links between smoking, socioeconomic deprivation and
lung cancer incidence and mortality are well known29 30 and
psychosocial outcomes were indeed poorer in those recruited
from the Liverpool area, which is known to have high levels of
deprivation and high incidence of lung cancer.31 Supportive
interventions to improve the quality of information and care
and minimise potential distress in vulnerable groups, should be
implemented alongside routine LDCT lung screening. In add-
ition, individuals with high pre-existing cancer distress could be
identified for psychosocial support.24
While the overall trend towards minimal psychosocial conse-
quences of UKLS is encouraging, we acknowledge the possibility
that sample selection bias may limit external validity. High-risk
individuals who were older, female, smokers, from a lower
socioeconomic group or more concerned about lung cancer
were less likely to participate21 and continued to be under-
represented as the trial progressed. These findings are consistent
with barriers to uptake that have been reported in previous lung
screening trials.14 16
17 32 The current findings suggest that
women may initially be less aware or convinced of the need for
lung screening, compared with breast and cervical cancers
where there are well-established screening programmes. In the
DLCST
, trial participation was similarly associated with depriv-
ation and age, but in contrast to our findings men were under-
represented
in
the
DLCST
.33
Further
in-depth
qualitative
research is required to understand the perceptions and attitudes
of men and women who are at high risk and eligible for lung
cancer screening.
We also recognise that sample bias may have led to potential
type II error in detecting long-term effects of LDCT screening,
due to the relatively small number of participants with true-
positive
or
significant
incidental
results.
Gareen

reported poorer health-related quality of life and higher state
anxiety in NLST participants who received a lung cancer diag-
nosis. Some participants were excluded from screening out-
comes analyses, for example, those referred but in whom lung
cancer was not diagnosed. Long-term psychosocial effects in
these individuals are unknown. Interestingly, there was no
observed difference in distress between participants who had
incidental non-lung cancer findings compared with those with
negative results. However, the number of significant incidental
findings may increase in routine practice compared with a trial
setting. The potential for distress caused by unfavourable or
unexpected findings of lung screening should not be ruled out.
We acknowledge that, in future, the psychosocial consequences
of lung cancer screening will need to be examined in the
context of a health service (if implemented) and that the
single-screen design of the UKLS trial may limit the generalis-
ability of our findings to the context of enrolment in a routine
screening programme.
LDCT lung screening is currently recommended in the US,
but
policy
decisions
in
Europe
await
pooled
data
from
European trials.34 There is an ethical imperative to promote
informed participation in lung cancer screening prior to its
routine implementation in the UK. Public and patient facing
information
materials
should
aim
to
prepare
people
for
informed participation by increasing understanding of the
purpose, benefits and risks of lung screening, including the pos-
sibility of receiving abnormal results and strategies for coping
with associated short-term distress. Interventions that target
smokers may improve informed participation in lung screening
and provide a platform from which to engage smokers in
smoking cessation services.
The present results must be interpreted alongside evidence of
feasibility, cost-effectiveness and reach to determine whether
LDCT lung cancer screening should become programmatic in the
UK. Strategies for engaging and supporting high risk, harder to
reach groups should also be trialled if lung cancer screening is to
be successfully and equitably rolled out in the community setting.
