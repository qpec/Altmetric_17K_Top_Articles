OBJECTIVES: To provide an epidemiologic description of fatal and nonfatal window blind–
related injuries among US children younger than 6 years of age.
METHODS: Data from the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s National Electronic Injury 
Surveillance System and In-Depth Investigation (IDI) databases were retrospectively 
analyzed.
RESULTS: From 1990 to 2015, there were an estimated 16 827 (95% confidence interval: 
13 732–19 922) window blind–related injuries among children younger than 6 years of 
age treated in emergency departments in the United States, corresponding to an injury 
rate of 2.7 per 100 000 children. The most common mechanism of injury was “struck by” 
(48.8%). Entanglement injuries accounted for 11.9% of all cases, and among this subgroup, 
98.9% involved blind cords, and 80.7% were to the neck. Overall, most injuries (93.4%) 
were treated and released. In IDI reports for 1996 through 2012, we identified 231 window 
blind cord entanglement incidents among children <6 years of age, and 98.7% involved the 
child’s neck; entanglements with the window blind’s operating cords (76.4%) or inner cords 
(22.1%) were the most common. Two-thirds of entanglement incidents included in the IDI 
database resulted in death (67.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite existing voluntary safety standards for window blinds, these products 
continue to pose an injury risk to young children. Although many of the injuries in this 
study were nonfatal and resulted in minor injuries, cases involving window blind cord 
entanglements frequently resulted in hospitalization or death. A mandatory safety 
standard that eliminates accessible window blind cords should be adopted.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: Window blind 
cords have been recognized as a safety hazard for 
young children for more than 70 years. Numerous 
voluntary safety standards and recalls for window 
blinds have been implemented to reduce the risk of 
these injuries.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: Window blinds remain 
an important injury hazard for young children. 
Although cord entanglements are not the most 
common mechanism of window blind injury, they 
pose a serious strangulation risk and can result in 
hospitalization or death.

 Window blinds are frequently 
found in homes throughout the 
United States. However, there are 
potential dangers associated with 
these products, especially the risk 
of strangulation among young 
children by window blind cords. 
The US Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (CPSC) ranks window 
blind cords among the top 5 hidden 
hazards in US homes.1
Window blind injuries have been 
identified in the medical literature 
as early as 1945, yet they continue 
to occur today.2 From 1981 to 1995, 
there were 183 deaths from window 
blind cord asphyxiations among 
young children in the United States, 
and the mortality rate for window 
cord strangulations was 0.14 per 
100 000 children <4 years old.3 In 
1994, the CPSC and Window Covering 
Manufacturers Association, Inc 
(WCMA) announced an industry plan 
to eliminate loops from most window 
blind pull cords and offer free repair 
kits for consumers possessing 
these products.4 In 2000, similar 
measures were taken to address 
loops in the inner cords of window 
blinds.5 Despite previous recalls of 
specific types of window blinds and 
existing voluntary safety standards 
for window coverings, window blind 
cords continue to be a public health 
threat to young children.4

Several studies and case reports 
have been published concerning 
window blind cords and the risk of 
strangulation among children.2,

Our research is unique in that we 
examine both fatal and nonfatal 
window blind–related injuries using 
2 robust national databases. National 
Electronic Injury Surveillance 
System (NEISS) data are analyzed to 
provide a nationally representative 
description of pediatric injuries 
associated with window blinds, 
shades, and cords, and In-Depth 
Investigation (IDI) reports provide 
detailed information on window 
blind cord entanglements. Together, 
these data comprehensively elucidate 
the epidemiology of window blind–
related injuries among US children 
<6 years old.
MethODs
Data sources
Data were obtained from the NEISS 
and IDI databases maintained by 
the CPSC. The NEISS database is a 
nationally representative stratified 
probability sample that includes 
injury data from ∼100 hospital 
emergency departments (EDs). The 
sample frame consists of more than 
5300 hospitals with a 24-hour ED 
and at least 6 beds located in the 
United States and its territories. The 
NEISS database provides information 
regarding consumer products 
involved, patient demographics, 
body region injured, injury diagnosis, 
disposition from the ED, and a brief 
case narrative.
The IDI database contains reports 
from CPSC field investigators, who 
follow-up on selected consumer 
product–related incidents. Cases are 
identified by using the NEISS as well 
as the CPSC’s Injury and Potential 
Injury Incident and Death Certificate 
databases.12 The Injury and Potential 
Injury Incident database includes 
information from media reports, 
consumer complaints, medical 
examiner and coroner reports, and 
other sources. The IDI database 
provides detailed information about 
the injury incident, including data 
from victim and eyewitness reports, 
documents from local authorities, 
and product information.
case selection
Definitions of window covering 
terminology used in this study 
are included in the Supplemental 
Information.6 In this study, we 
included only incidents involving 
window blinds and shades. Incidents 
associated with shutters, draperies, 
or curtains were excluded. The terms 
“blind” and “window blind” are used 
interchangeably in this article to 
represent window blinds and shades, 
unless otherwise stated.
Window blind–related injuries 
among children <6 years old treated 
in US EDs from 1990 to 2015 were 
identified in the NEISS database 
by using product code 0638 for 
“window shades, venetian blinds, or 
indoor shutters.” The following were 
excluded: 5 cases in which window 
blinds were not the cause of injury, 4 
cases involving shutters, and 1 case 
in which the injury was related to a 
box of uninstalled window blinds. 
There are 596 cases from the NEISS 
included in this study.
IDI cases involving window covering 
cord entanglement among young 
children from 1996 to 2012 were 
reviewed. To be consistent with the 
NEISS, 14 cases involving curtain or 
drapery cords and 5 cases involving 
children ≥6 years old were excluded. 
Fifteen cases were excluded because 
investigators were unable to obtain 
additional information. There are 231 
IDI reports included in this study.
neIss Variables
NEISS data were consolidated 
and reclassified. Body regions 
were grouped into the following 
categories: (1) head (including 
the face, head, mouth, or eyeball), 
(2) neck (including “all parts of 
body [more than 50% of body]” 
or “25–50% of body” when neck 
involvement was indicated in 
the narrative), (3) hand (hand or 
finger), and (4) other. Diagnoses 
were grouped into the following 
categories: (1) laceration (lacerations 
and avulsions when skin avulsion 
in a laceration-type injury was 
indicated in the narrative), (2) anoxia 
(anoxia and “other” when anoxia 
was indicated in the narrative), (3) 
contusion or abrasion, and (4) other. 
Incident location was categorized 
as (1) home or (2) other (including 
school and other public property). 
Disposition from the ED was 
classified as one of the following: (1) 
treated and released, (2) hospitalized

Downloaded from 
 (treated and transferred to another 
hospital, treated and admitted, and 
held for observation), (3) left against 
medical advice, and (4) fatality.
NEISS case narratives were used to 
define injury mechanism, the part of 
the blind involved, and blind type. 
Injury mechanism was grouped 
into the following categories: (1) 
entanglement (any body part, 
regardless of strangulation concern), 
(2) struck by (struck by the falling 
blind, pulling the blind onto self, or 
unspecified struck by), (3) struck on, 
(4) cut by, and (5) other (falling due 
to blinds and other mechanisms).
IDI Variables
Data from IDI reports were also 
recategorized. The body region 
involved was classified as (1) neck 
or (2) arm (including the wrist). 
Diagnoses were grouped into the 
following categories: (1) no injury 
(ie, near-miss cases), (2) anoxia, and 
(3) abrasion (including laceration 
and contusion). ED disposition was 
categorized as one of the following: 
(1) nonhospital treatment (including 
no injury or injured but treated at 
home), (2) treated and released, 
(3) hospitalized, and (4) fatality. 
Blinds were categorized into the 
following types: (1) horizontal 
blinds (including Venetian and mini 
blinds), (2) vertical blinds, (3) Roman 
shades, (4) cellular and/or pleated 
shades, (5) roller shades, and (6) 
roll-up shades. Blind location was 
categorized as one of the following: 
(1) living room, (2) bedroom, and (3) 
other. Cord types were categorized 
as one of the following: (1) operating 
cords (including tilt cords and 
continuous loop cords), (2) inner 
cords, and (3) lifting loops. Mode 
of entanglement was categorized 
as one of the following: (1) loop in 
the manufactured design, (2) loop 
formed by knotted or tangled cords, 
(3) loop formed by the inner cord, 
(4) loop formed by tying the cord to 
a stationary object (usually a wall 
or headrail, which is the top portion 
of a blind unit affixed to the wall), 
and (5) nonloop (ie, intentional 
or unintentional wrapping of cord 
around the child’s neck). The 
child’s last known status before the 
incident was categorized as one of 
the following: (1) put to sleep and/
or asleep, (2) playing, (3) watching 
television, (4) looking out the 
window, and (5) other. The child’s 
position when found was classified 
into the following categories: (1) 
suspended (feet above the ground), 
(2) partially suspended, and (3) not 
suspended. Objects facilitating access 
to blind cords were categorized as 
one of the following: (1) bed, (2) 
crib or playpen, (3) floor, (4) couch 
or sofa, (5) window sill, (6) other 
furniture, and (7) other objects.
statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by using SAS 
Enterprise Guide 7.11 HF3 (SAS 
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). NEISS data 
were analyzed by using SAS complex 
survey procedures to account for 
sampling design. CPSC sampling 
weights were used to calculate 
national estimates, and the Taylor 
series linearization method was 
used to calculate the variance of the 
estimates. The results reported for 
the NEISS data are stable national 
estimates unless stated otherwise. An 
estimate is potentially unstable if the 
sample size is <20 cases, the estimate 
is <1200 cases, or the coefficient of 
variation is >33%. For completeness 
in reporting, potentially unstable 
estimates involving hospitalization 
and death associated with 
entanglement are reported. US 
Census Bureau July 1 intercensal 
and postcensal population estimates 
were used to calculate injury rates.13 
Because all the annual estimates are 
potentially unstable, secular trend 
analysis was not performed, but the 
estimated annual number of injuries 
is given in Fig 1. IDI report analyses 
were restricted to frequencies and 
proportions. This study was judged 
as exempt by the institutional review 
board of the authors’ institution.

 corresponded to an average of 
647 injuries annually or 2.7 (95% 
CI: 2.2–3.2) injuries per 100 000 
children. The mean age was 2.6 
years (SEM: 0.1; median: 2.0 years; 
interquartile range: 1.4–3.1) and 
61.6% were boys. The location of the 
injury incident was documented for 
77.9% of cases, and of those, 94.7% 
occurred at home. The majority of 
injuries occurred to the head region 
(65.3%) and were often diagnosed 
as a laceration (56.3%) or contusion 
or abrasion (22.7%) (Table 1). Most 
(93.4%) blind-related injuries were 
treated and released from the ED.
Among the 42.1% of injuries that 
specified the blind type involved, 
most were associated with horizontal 
blinds (75.7%) or shades (16.7%) 
(Table 1). Blind parts involved were 
documented for 93.6% of cases, 
and among this subgroup, 53.9% 
involved the entire blind unit, and 
15.3% were associated with the 
blind cord (Table 1). Mechanisms 
of injury were specified for 98.8% 
of cases, and among these, 48.8% 
were “struck by, 
” followed by “cut 
by” (18.2%), “struck on” (13.3%), 
and “entanglement” (11.9%) (Table 
1). Among the entanglement-related 
injuries, 98.9% involved blind cords, 
80.5% were to the neck, 29.3% were 
hospitalized, and 12.9% resulted in 
death. Entanglement was associated 
with 79.8% of the 726 children who 
were hospitalized and 94.3% of the 
271 deaths.
Window blind cord entanglement 
Incidents based on IDIs
From 1996 to 2012, there were 
231 IDI reports for window blind 
cord entanglement incidents among 
children <6 years old. The mean and 
median ages were 2.2 years (SEM: 
0.1) and 2.0 years (interquartile 
range: 1.3–3.0), respectively, and 
59.3% (137 out of 231) were boys 
(Table 2). Almost all (99.1%; 229 out 
of 231) of the incidents occurred at 
home, specifically in the bedroom 
(64.9%; 148 out of 228) or living 
room (26.3%; 60 out of 228). Nearly 
all (98.7%; 228 out of 231) of the 
entanglements involved the child’s 
neck and were diagnosed as anoxia 
(77.1%; 178 out of 231) or an 
abrasion (19.0%; 44 out of 231). The 
majority of entanglements resulted 
in death (67.1%; 155 out of 231), and 
8.7% (20 out of 231) of children were 
admitted to a hospital. Among the 
nonfatal cases, 11.8% (9 out of 76) 
were near misses without injury, and 
the remaining cases were diagnosed 
with abrasion (57.9%; 44 out of 76) 
or anoxia (30.3%; 23 out of 76).
The majority of incidents occurred 
while children were under the care

Downloaded from 
 of parents (89.5%; 204 out of 228) 
and few were witnessed (2.6%; 6 
out of 231). The child’s last known 
status was often reported as placed 
to sleep and/or asleep (43.2%; 95 
out of 220), playing (33.6%; 74 out of 
220), or watching television (14.1%; 
31 out of 220) (Table 2). Among 
cases of children who were not 
placed to sleep and/or asleep, 98 had 
the length of time left unsupervised 
documented, and of these, 11.2% (4 
out of 98) were left unsupervised for 
<1 minute, 43.9% (43 out of 98) for 
<5 minutes, and 66.3% (65 out of 98) 
for <10 minutes. Children accessed 
blind cords from a bed (21.3%; 48 
out of 225), crib or playpen (20.4%; 
46 out of 225), floor (19.1%; 43 
out of 225), or couch (18.2%; 41 
out of 225). Of the 176 cases that 
reported the child’s position when 
found, 17.6% (31 out of 176) were 
suspended with their feet above the 
ground.
Although the majority of incidents 
involved horizontal blinds (59.2%; 
132 out of 223) and operating cords 
(76.4%; 159 out of 208), there were 
variations in the blind and cord types 
involved (Table 3). Among the 44 
cases involving vertical blinds, 95.5% 
(42 out of 44) were associated with 
continuous loop cords. Of the 132 
incidents attributed to horizontal 
blinds, 71.2% (94 out of 132) 
involved operating cords and 17.4% 
(23 out of 132) involved inner cords. 
Most Roman shade–related incidents 
involved the inner cords (85.2%; 23 
out of 27) on the back of the blind. 
Among the 194 cases that specified 
entanglement mode, 43.8% (85 out 
of 194) involved cord loops that were 
part of the manufactured design, 
23.7% (46 out of 194) involved loops 
formed by the inner cords, and 22.2% 
(43 out of 194) involved loops formed 
by knotted or tangled cords (Table 3).
DIscussIOn
More than 16 800 children <6 
years old were treated in US EDs 
for window blind–related injuries 
during the 26-year study period, 
averaging 647 children annually or 
∼2 children per day. Most window 
blind–related injuries were not 
serious, and the majority of children 
seeking care in EDs were treated and 
released. Entanglement accounted 
for 11.9% of window blind–related 
injuries treated in US EDs, with 
98.9% involving blind cords and 
80.5% involving children entangled 
by the neck. This potentially lethal 
mechanism of injury has been the 
long-standing focus of the CPSC and 
other groups.4, 
 
5
Among young children, contact 
with window blind cords can lead 
to entanglement and strangulation. 
From 1996 to 2012, there were 231 
blind cord entanglements reported 
in the IDI database and included 
in this study. Two-thirds of these 
entanglements resulted in death. 
Entanglement hazards vary by the 
type of blind and cord involved. 
Both looped and nonlooped cords 
present a strangulation risk to 
young children. Continuous loop 
cords, frequently found in vertical 
and roll-up shades, require proper 
installation and maintenance of 
a tension device. Without this 
component, the continuous loop 
is left hanging from the headrail, 
creating a strangulation hazard. 
Horizontal blinds and Roman shades 
have inner cords, which can present 
a loop hazard when pulled out from 
the blind. Although the current 
voluntary safety standard requires 
that these types of blinds be designed 
with inner cord stops to address this 
risk, 
6 it is up to consumers to ensure 
that the cord stops are properly 
adjusted and that older blinds are 
retrofitted with inner cord stops. 
The percentage of households with 
properly adjusted or retrofitted inner 
cord stops is unknown; however, it 
is likely that many consumers are 
unaware of this recommendation or 
have not adhered to it.

 Other hazards result from cord 
loops not contained within the 
product design but created by 
consumers after installation. These 
loops are commonly created by 
knotted or tangled pull cords or 
cords tied to a stationary object, 
often in an attempt to keep them 
out of a child’s reach. Injuries have 
also occurred when children have 
intentionally or unintentionally 
wrapped nonlooped cords around 
their necks. Therefore, it is important 
to keep all blind cords out of young 
children’s environments. The similar 
strangulation hazard posed by cords 
and elastics longer than 12 inches 
on pull toys for young children has 
been recognized in federal toy safety 
standard specifications.14, 
 
15
The dangers associated with blinds 
are evident as toddlers gain mobility 
and become curious about their 
surroundings. Although possessing 
the motor skills necessary to 
access blind cords, they lack the 
cognitive ability to understand 
the risk of strangulation or the 
developmental maturity to free 
themselves once entangled. Window 
blind strangulation incidents can be 
fatal within minutes and can occur 
silently. In this regard, they are 
similar to child drownings. Accessible 
window blind cords should be 
considered as hazardous to young 
children as standing bodies of water. 
In addition, the notion that closer 
caregiver supervision can prevent 
window blind incidents is unrealistic 
because it is impossible to supervise 
children constantly, and these 
events can happen quickly. Primary 
prevention through product and 
environmental modification is the 
most effective approach.16
In 1996, the WCMA, in cooperation 
with the CPSC and the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI), 
issued a voluntary safety standard 
to address looped window blind 
cords.12 The standard has been 
revised 6 times, most recently in 
2014, in attempts to reduce various 
strangulation risks associated with 
different window blind cord types 
and window covering products.6, 
 
12 In 
this study we illustrate that despite 
these efforts, pediatric window blind 
injuries and deaths continue to occur, 
demonstrating the need to eliminate 
this hazard. To this end, in 2014, 
the CPSC unanimously approved 
a petition to develop a mandatory 
safety standard for window covering 
products. Unlike the current 
voluntary standard (ANSI/WCMA 
A100.1-2014), 
6 which aims to 
reduce the risk of strangulation, the 
proposed mandatory standard would 
remove the hazard by requiring 
all window covering products be 
cordless or have cords that are 
inaccessible to children.6, 
 
12 Cordless 
technologies are available for most 
blinds and shades and add little 
cost to manufacturing. In 2017, the 
WCMA proposed revising the current 
voluntary standard to eliminate 
the use of cords in all standard or 
“off-the-shelf” window blinds.17 
This would not apply to custom-
made products, which comprise 
approximately one-quarter of the 
market.17 Efforts related to the 
proposed mandatory and revised 
voluntary standards are ongoing.

 Previous prevention 
recommendations have included 
the safe storage of blind cords, the 
use of retrofit safety kits, parental 
supervision, and education by 
physicians.8 
– 
11, 
18 
– 
20 Although these 
measures can help reduce the risk of 
injury, their effectiveness depends 
on action by consumers. Injury 
prevention theory indicates that 
as the effort needed to implement 
a prevention strategy increases, 
its effectiveness decreases.16 Even 
when child caregivers are aware of 
the safety hazard, they may not take 
action. One study revealed that 73% 
of parents surveyed were aware of 
the risk posed by window blinds, 
but only 23% had addressed the 
concern in their home.21 Designing 
the problem out of existence, in this 
case by allowing the manufacture 
of only cordless blind, is the most 
effective strategy. This reengineering 
approach has been used successfully 
to prevent a variety of consumer 
product–related injuries, such 
as those associated with baby 
walkers.22, 
 
23
Although the need for mandatory 
safety standards requiring the 
elimination of window blind cords is 
clear, no such regulations currently 
exist. In the meantime, child 
caregivers should be advised of the 
dangers associated with window 
blinds and the preventive measures 
that can reduce injury risk. Whenever 
possible, blinds with cords should be

replaced with cordless blinds, blinds 
with inaccessible cords, or other 
types of cordless window coverings, 
such as interior window shutters, 
draperies, and curtains. Retrofit kits 
to eliminate certain cord hazards are 
also available.12 Cribs, beds, couches, 
and other furniture should be placed 
away from window blinds with cords 
to help restrict access by young 
children.
This study has several limitations. 
The NEISS underestimates the true 
number of injuries because it does 
not include injuries that are treated 
in a non-ED medical setting or do 
not receive medical care. Injuries 
treated in EDs do not represent 
the complete spectrum of injuries 
associated with blinds. In particular, 
the NEISS may not capture fatal 
injuries that are not transported 
to the ED or occur after inpatient 
admission. In addition, IDI reports 
are not a representative sample of all 
window blind cord entanglements 
and are likely to include more serious 
incidents of strangulation and 
near-miss strangulation. Therefore, 
entanglement risk associated with 
each type of window blind could not 
be evaluated because of potential 
bias in the IDI sample and lack of 
exposure data for each blind type. In 
addition, information in IDIs varies 
in its level of completeness and 
detail. Because of small sample sizes 
in this study, subanalyses could not 
be performed on some variables of 
interest. Despite these limitations, 
the NEISS and IDI databases 
provide important complementary 
information characterizing pediatric 
window blind–related injuries in the 
United States.
cOnclusIOns
Many window blind–related injuries 
among young children treated in US 
EDs do not result in serious medical 
outcomes. However, strangulation 
incidents due to window blind cord 
entanglements continue to occur 
despite the existence of voluntary 
safety standards and risk reduction 
strategies intended to address 
these hazards. A mandatory safety 
standard that eliminates accessible 
window blind cords should be 
adopted.
