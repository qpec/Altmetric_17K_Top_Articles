Abstract
Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) is a human pathogen and the causative agent for leprosy,
a chronic disease characterized by lesions of the skin and peripheral nerve damage. Zoo-
notic transmission of M. leprae to humans by nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinc-
tus) has been shown to occur in the southern United States, mainly in Texas, Louisiana, and
Florida. Nine-banded armadillos are also common in South America, and residents living in
some areas in Brazil hunt and kill armadillos as a dietary source of protein. This study exam-
ines the extent of M. leprae infection in wild armadillos and whether these New World mam-
mals may be a natural reservoir for leprosy transmission in Brazil, similar to the situation in
the southern states of the U.S. The presence of the M. leprae-specific repetitive sequence
RLEP was detected by PCR amplification in purified DNA extracted from armadillo spleen
and liver tissue samples. A positive RLEP signal was confirmed in 62% of the armadillos
(10/16), indicating high rates of infection with M. leprae. Immunohistochemistry of sections
of infected armadillo spleens revealed mycobacterial DNA and cell wall constituents in situ
detected by SYBR Gold and auramine/rhodamine staining techniques, respectively. The M.
leprae-specific antigen, phenolic glycolipid I (PGL-I) was detected in spleen sections using a
rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for PGL-I. Anti-PGL-I titers were assessed by ELISA in
sera from 146 inhabitants of Belterra, a hyperendemic city located in western Para
´ state in
Brazil. A positive anti-PGL-I titer is a known biomarker for M. leprae infection in both humans
and armadillos. Individuals who consumed armadillo meat most frequently (more than once
per month) showed a significantly higher anti-PGL-I titer than those who did not eat or ate

environmental reservoir. Consequently, people who hunt, kill, or process or eat armadillo
meat are at a higher risk for infection with M. leprae from these animals.
Author summary
Armadillos have been shown to be a natural reservoir of Mycobacterium leprae infection
in the southern states of the U.S. and have been implicated in the zoonotic transmission of
leprosy to humans. To investigate this in Brazil, we conducted surveys of armadillos in
western Para
´ state in the Brazilian Amazon region where leprosy is hyperendemic in
humans. Individuals living in the small town of Belterra were surveyed for the extent and
frequency of interaction with armadillos (hunting, preparing the meat for cooking, or eat-
ing the meat for food). We also took samples of liver and spleen from armadillos to look
for M. leprae infection in the tissues. We found that a majority of residents had some con-
tact with armadillos (~65%) and that infection by M. leprae in armadillos in this area was
also very high (62%). Those individuals who ate armadillo meat more than once a month
had a significantly higher antibody titer to the M. leprae-specific antigen, PGL-I. Under-
standing the dynamics of leprosy transmission in different geographic regions and know-
ing the behavioral risks of humans interacting with potentially infected animals will help
clarify the relative risk of zoonotic transmission of leprosy in this region.
Introduction
The human pathogen, M. leprae, causes leprosy, a slowly developing chronic granulomatous
disease mainly affecting the skin and peripheral nerves, resulting in disfiguring lesions and pro-
gressive nerve damage that can lead to muscle weakness or atrophy, bone loss, amputations and
blindness [1]. The discovery of the bacillus was credited by work by the Norwegian physician
Gerhardt Henrik Armauer Hansen in 1873. The name Hansen’s disease (hansenı
´ase in Portu-
guese) is used in Brazil to lessen the stigma associated with the common name. Multidrug ther-
apy (MDT) was introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the mid-1980’s, and
has been provided free of charge upon diagnosis worldwide for over 30 years. The worldwide
prevalence of the disease has decreased from >5 million cases in the 1980’s to <200,000 by
2016. Nevertheless, the WHO recorded 214,783 new cases in 2016 [2], slightly higher than the
previous year, with around 80% of all cases being found in only three countries: India, Brazil
and Indonesia. The Americas recorded 27,356 cases in 2016, with Brazil having 25,218, or
92.2% of the total. Brazil is still the only country in the world that has not reached the WHO
goal of <1 new case per 10,000 population and is currently at around 1.2/10,000 nationally
(SINAN, Brazil’s Notifiable Diseases Information System) [3]. However, there is a wide varia-
tion in new case detection in regional areas in Brazil, ranging from as low as <0.2/10,000 in the
southern state of Rio Grande do Sul to >4/10,000, considered hyperendemic, in the central
(Mato Grosso, Rondo
ˆnia), north (Para
´, Tocantins), and northeastern states (Maranhão) [4].
Historically, Para
´ and the Amazon region have recorded some of the highest new case detection
rates in the country, despite having one of the lowest population densities [5]. Reasons behind
this have been well-documented, and include living in a hyperendemic area, low human devel-
opment index (HDI, which combines life expectancy at birth, per capita income, and education
level), living with an untreated index case or within 200 meters of a case, high household density
(>2 people per bedroom), poor nutritional status, and lack of healthcare availability [6,7].

 The disease causes a broad array of skin lesions, nerve damage, peripheral neuropathy and
anesthesia. The variability in clinical manifestations of leprosy is aligned with the hosts’ abili-
ties to mount effective immune responses to M. leprae, dependent on the interplay of both cell
mediated and humoral responses [8]. There is an overall genetic resistance towards developing
leprosy, with over 90% of people having a natural immunity [9]. For those individuals who do
progress to disease, the interplay of cell mediated and humoral immunity to M. leprae becomes
clear from the well-known immunological and clinical leprosy spectrum, ranging from tuber-
culoid (TT/BT) or paucibacillary (PB) leprosy to lepromatous (BB/BL/LL) or multibacillary
(MB) leprosy, defined by Ridley-Jopling classification based on histopathology and bacillary
load [10]. PB patients generally show high cellular responses to M. leprae antigens in vitro as
measured by the production of Th1 cytokines, particularly IFN-γ, and have low antibody titers
to M. leprae-specific antigens. MB patients have lost some or all capacity to mount a cell medi-
ated response due to T cell anergy but have high antibody titers to M. leprae antigens, particu-
larly to the M. leprae-specific glycolipid, PGL-I [11,12]. The humoral response to PGL-I in
leprosy patients, mainly IgM, correlates very well with the BI (bacillary index) and is highly
specific, and the anti-PGL-I titer can be easily assessed using either the standard ELISA assay
or in a lateral flow device [13–16] using the synthetic di- or trisaccharide of PGL-I linked to a
protein carrier, bovine or human serum albumin (BSA or HSA) derivatives. Anti-PGL-I IgM
seropositivity has been used to reliably assess the prevalence of leprosy in endemic areas, since
a positive titer is a definitive biomarker of prior M. leprae infection [17–21].
Since M. leprae cannot be grown in vitro on axenic medium, the mechanism of human
transmission has long been debated. The most widely accepted theory is that untreated index
cases, particularly MB individuals who are capable of discharging an estimated 107 bacilli per
day from nasal secretions [22], are the main source of transmission via the aerosol route. A
number of studies have shown that consanguineous individuals of index cases living for
extended periods, months or years, in the same household (household contacts, HC) have the
highest risk for developing disease [23–26].
Besides human contact, the only other known transmission route is from human contact
with armadillos that have been naturally infected with M. leprae. Armadillos have an immune
system that responds similarly to M. leprae infection, and essentially recapitulates the spectrum
of human disease [27]. This includes developing progressive nerve damage and characteristic
ulcers and skin lesions due to loss of sensation in the feet and face and even develop high anti-
body titers to PGL-I and other M. leprae proteins [28]. As early as 1975, wild armadillos were
found to be naturally infected with M. leprae, but it was later shown that sylvan leprosy had
existed in this species for decades before they were artificially infected [29,30]. Surveys in
Texas and Louisiana showed that disease prevalence rates among nine-banded armadillos
were >20% in some areas [31].
In this study we investigated armadillos from an area in Brazil that is hyperendemic for lep-
rosy in the town of Belterra in western Para
´ state to explore whether sylvan leprosy exists in
wild armadillos in this area. We also performed a survey of the relationship of the people in
this town with armadillos to determine if any activities related to hunting, killing, preparing or
handling the armadillo meat for consumption, as well as the frequency of armadillo in the diet
had any effect on the anti-PGL-I titer.

Study location
The survey site chosen was the city of Belterra in western Para
´ state where two rural communi-
ties exist at 92 Km (São Jorge) and 135 Km (Corpus Christi) on the Santare
´m-Cuiaba
´ highway,
located roughly by coordinates at 2˚ 38’S and 54˚ 56’W. The city has a total area of 4,398 km2
with 17,036 inhabitants (IBGE, Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica, 2015) and is
roughly 1,300 Km southwest from the capital city of Bele
´m. The city was chosen because of its
proximity to Santare
´m where one of the affiliated universities is located (UFOPA) and because
it was determined that there was a high density of armadillos living in the surrounding forest
with a high percentage of people living in this rural area that hunted or consumed armadillos
as food.
Human subject population
A total of 146 individuals living in the town of Belterra were asked to participate in a research
protocol approved by the institutional review boards at the Universidade Federal do Oeste do
Para
´ (UFOPA) and the Universidade Federal do Para
´ (UFPA) (IRB protocol #517.394 ICS/
UFPA) and Colorado State University (IRB protocol 15-6340H) and conducted in accordance
with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All individuals who agreed to participate
read and signed a written informed consent document. In the case of minors, consent was
obtained from a parent or guardian of the child. All individuals received a free dermatologic
exam performed by experienced leprosy clinicians, and a sample of blood was drawn from
each person by a trained phlebotomist for anti-PGL-I titer assessment. Besides demographic
information for each individual, a survey included questions about the extent of contact with
armadillos (hunting armadillos in the forests; killing and/or handling the armadillo meat for
consumption; and the frequency of eating armadillo meat). The diagnosis of leprosy was per-
formed using internationally accepted clinical criteria based on the presence of skin lesions
with sensory loss and/or nerve damage associated with nerve swelling and pain, muscle weak-
ness or disability. Individuals diagnosed with leprosy received free MDT treatment from their
local basic health unit.
Assessment of anti-PGL-I titer by ELISA
An indirect ELISA was used to measure the anti-PGL-I IgM titer of all of the serum samples
tested at a 1:300 dilution using a protocol previously reported [32]. The cut-off for positivity
was established at an optical density (O.D.) of 0.295 based on the average plus three times the
standard deviation of healthy subjects from a hyperendemic area as reported. The O.D. for
each well was read at 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader.

 Collection of armadillo liver and spleen samples for detection of RLEP
sequence by PCR
By collaborating with local residents who hunted armadillos in the surrounding forest in the
area, we obtained samples of armadillo liver and spleen from freshly killed animals from differ-
ent households from residents in both villages in Belterra (“A” armadillos from Corpus Christi,
n = 3, and “B” armadillos from São Jorge, n = 13). A sterile scalpel blade was used to excise sev-
eral pieces of tissue, at least 1cm3 each, and placed in individual sterile 5 ml plastic tubes con-
taining 70% ethanol to fix the specimen before DNA extraction. A fresh scalpel blade was used
for each tissue for each animal. Environmental approval of wild armadillo tissue sampling was
obtained with ICMBio authorization for research activities (SISBIO 44831–1). DNA was
extracted in the laboratory from approximately 1 gm of fixed tissue using the Qiagen DNeasy
Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) following the protocol supplied by the man-
ufacturer. The amount of DNA in each sample was quantified using nanodrop. The M. leprae-
specific repetitive sequence, RLEP, was amplified by PCR using a Qiagen Multiplex PCR Kit
(Qiagen) and primers (LP1 forward primer:
5’-TGCATGTCATGGCCTTGAGG-3’ and LP2 reverse primer:
5’-CACCGATACCAGCGGCAGAA-3’) that amplifies a 129-base pair fragment found in
the M. leprae genome. The primer sequences and the protocol used were adapted from Dono-
ghue [33] using the following PCR protocol: denaturation at 95˚C for 15 min, 40 cycles of
denaturation at 94˚C for 30 s, primer annealing at 58˚C for 40 s, extension at 72˚C for 30 s,
and final extension at 72˚C for 10 min. Each reaction set included a positive control tube using
purified M. leprae DNA (2 ng) and a negative control tube without template DNA.
Staining of M. leprae in armadillo spleen sections to detect mycobacterial
DNA, cell wall constituents and M. leprae PGL-I
At the time of necropsies, samples of spleen were aseptically removed and prepared for histo-
logical examination and specific staining procedures for visualization of mycobacteria. Tissue
samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), embedded in
paraffin and sectioned to 5 μm thickness. Subsequent tissue sections were mounted on glass
slides, deparaffinized and stained either with auramine-rhodamine (AR) or SYBR Gold fluo-
rescent stain [34]. For AR staining, each section was stained using the TB Fluorescent Stain Kit
T (Becton-Dickinson, Sparks, Maryland) per manufacturer’s instructions. The AR stain was
added to the deparaffinized section on the slide and incubated in the dark at room temperature
for 25 min, washed in acid-alcohol (0.5% HCl in 70% isopropanol) for no more than 3 min,
followed by washing with water and counterstaining with potassium permanganate (0.5%) for
4 min. The slides were washed again in water and then mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade
mounting medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California).
SYBR Gold staining was performed using a dilution of SYBR Gold fluorescence dye at
1:1,000 in a stain solution of 0.85 M phenol in a 60% glycerol/14% isopropanol solution in dis-
tilled water. The slides were heated on a block at 65˚C for 5 min and then cooled at room tem-
perature for an additional 5 min. The tissue sections were washed with acid alcohol (0.5% HCl
in 70% isopropanol) for 3 min, then washed with water and counterstained with hematoxylin
QS (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), for 5–10 s. The excess hematoxylin was
washed away with distilled H2O and slides were subsequently stained with 4,6-diamidino-
2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) at 200 ng/ml final concentration for
10 min and washed again with water. Slides were mounted with Prolong Gold antifade mount-
ing media. All stained sections were visualized using Zeiss 510 confocal microscopy and Zen
software.

 For PGL-I antigen localization, deparaffinized spleen sections were covered with peroxi-
dazed 1 solution (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) for 5 min to block endogenous peroxidase,
followed by antigen retrieval procedure (Dako, Agilent Technologies, Carpinteria, CA). Back-
ground sniper (Biocare Medical) was used for 10 min to block nonspecific binding sites,
followed by addition of a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for PGL-I (pro-
duced at Colorado State University) and incubated for 2 h in a humidified chamber at room
temperature. Thereafter, the sections were washed 3 times for 5 min in PBS and incubated
with a secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG-F(ab0)2 coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h. After washing the sections with PBS, the substrate
(ImmPACT from AEC, Vector Laboratories) was added for 10 min or until brownish-red
color was developed. Slides were washed with PBS and counterstained with hematoxylin, fol-
lowed by visualization using light microscopy.
Control M. leprae infected and non-infected armadillo spleens that were formalin fixed and
paraffin embedded were generously provided by Dr. Maria Pena from the National Hansen’s
Disease Program (NHDP), Baton Rouge, LA. Sections of control tissues were stained for
PGL-I antigen as above. Sections were also stained by the Fite Faraco modification of the Ziehl-
Neelsen staining technique to identify acid fast bacilli in control and wild armadillo tissues.
Statistical analysis
The anti-PGL-I titer expressed as the O.D. was compared with the epidemiologic data and
individual’s contact with armadillos by the Mann-Whitney test. The frequency of anti-PGL-I
positives in the total population and among diagnosed leprosy patients were estimated
between variables by the ratio of crossed products-Odds Ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence
intervals using the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test to verify the significance of associations. The
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) statistical software program was used.
The threshold for statistical significance was set at 5%.

 Results
High infection rates in armadillos from Belterra
Sixteen armadillos with an average weight of 3.7 Kg and 54.3 cm in length were captured by
local residents by hunting in the surrounding tropical forest located around the communities.
When extracted DNA from spleen tissues was tested for the presence of the RLEP repetitive
sequence by PCR, 10/16 armadillos were positive (62%), indicating that a high percentage of
these animals were infected with M. leprae (Fig 1A). Since M. leprae infects internal organs in
armadillos, particularly spleen and liver, we examined both tissues to determine if infection
was consistently found in these organs. Of five armadillos examined from the same group,
armadillos that were RLEP positive in the spleen were also RLEP positive in the liver while ani-
mals that were RLEP negative were negative in both (Fig 1B). In addition, the signal strength
in positive animals was much stronger in spleen than in liver. This finding is consistent with
yields of M. leprae from experimentally infected armadillos from NHDP, with the yields in the
spleen averaging 4 to 10 fold higher than in liver. The sequence of the RLEP product produced
by PCR was confirmed to be identical to the published sequence found in M. leprae for all posi-
tive samples by submitting the PCR product for sequencing. Whole genome sequence results
confirmed M. leprae sequence in three animals (A7, B21 and B22) with ~2X coverage.
Thin sections of paraffin embedded armadillo spleens were stained to identify M. leprae in
situ using SYBR Gold (Fig 2A and 2B) and auramine/rhodamine (Fig 2C), staining techniques
which are highly specific for DNA or mycobacterial cell wall components, respectively. A rab-
bit polyclonal serum raised against the M. leprae-specific PGL-I antigen was used to stain
spleen sections by immunohistochemistry. Wild or control infected armadillo sections stained
with the pre-immune serum and control uninfected armadillo spleens from NHDP stained
with the anti-PGL-I serum were negative (Fig 3A and 3B, respectively). Diffusely localized
PGL-I antigen was seen in spleen sections from control infected NHDP armadillos (Fig 3C
and 3D) and wild infected armadillos (Fig 3E and 3F). In all cases, positive staining was identi-
fied using these techniques only in infected armadillo tissues. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)
and Fite Faraco staining (acid fast staining) of control NHDP infected and noninfected arma-
dillo and infected wild armadillo tissues sections were included to show the architecture of the
spleen and acid fast bacilli (Fig 4A–4F).
Characteristics of the individuals studied
Of the 146 people surveyed in the town of Belterra, the subjects were divided equally (n = 73)
between two villages located within the town 44 Km apart, namely the village of São Jorge,
where residents of 32 households participated, and the village of Corpus Christi, where 31
households were surveyed (Fig 5). Four new cases were diagnosed based on clinical signs and
symptoms during our visit (2.7%), and we identified 3 patients who had been previously diag-
nosed and received treatment, bringing the total to 7 patients identified. Testing for anti-
PGL-I titer by ELISA showed that 92/146 (63%) were positive. These numbers are consistent
with previously published data from our group on new case detection and anti-PGL-I positiv-
ity rates for individuals living in hyperendemic areas in the state of Para
´.
The four newly diagnosed cases and three other individuals who had completed treatment
displayed a wide range of characteristics (Table 1). The age range was from 13 to 72, with two

 residing in the São Jorge community, while five lived in Corpus Christi. Four of these individu-
als hunted armadillos resulting in a relatively high risk (OR 6.73, 95% CI 1.41–32.09, p = 0.02).
Although hunting armadillos in the forest was exclusively a male activity and handling or
cleaning the armadillo meat to prepare it for cooking was primarily a responsibility for
women, 6 of these male patients indicated that they also participated in cleaning or preparing
armadillo meat for cooking and also ate armadillo regularly, although these factors were not
significant, probably due to the small sample size. This suggests that the majority of the leprosy
patients had patterns of exposure (hunting, handling, and eating) to armadillos that were all at
the high end relative to other groups in the village.
Influence of hunting, cleaning or preparing meat for consumption, or
frequency of eating armadillo meat on the anti-PGL-I titer
We collected information from all of the individuals surveyed (n = 146) regarding the level of
exposure they had with armadillos based on different behavioral aspects and dietary prefer-
ences. This included detailed questions about various activities, including whether or not indi-
viduals hunted armadillos in the surrounding forest; whether they were involved in killing the
animals and preparing the meat for cooking or consumption; and the frequency with which
they consumed armadillo meat, ranging from not at all to those who ate armadillo meat more
than once per month. Of all of the individuals surveyed, 27/146 (18.5%) hunted armadillos in
the forest, 96/146 (65.8%) either handled or prepared the meat for consumption, and 91/146
(62.3%) ate armadillo meat at least once during the past year, with 27/146 (18.5%) individuals
eating them more than once per month. The percentage of individuals that participated in at
least one of these activities (hunting, preparing the meat for consumption, or eating the meat)
was 96/146 (65.8%). We then examined the PGL-I titers for each group of individuals based on
whether or not they participated in these activities or preferences (Table 2).
Overall, there was no statistical difference in the anti-PGL-I titers of those individuals who
hunted or did not hunt armadillos (p = 0.99); those who did or did not handle armadillo meat
in preparation for consumption (p = 0.90); or between individuals who did not eat or ate arma-
dillos (p = 0.50) (Fig 6A–6C). However, when we subdivided individuals who ate armadillo
meat in low to moderate frequencies (less than once per month) versus those who ate it fre-
quently (more than once per month), there was a significantly higher median anti-PGL-I titer
in those individuals who consumed armadillo meat most frequently (p = 0.01) with a higher
risk (OR = 1.77, 95% CI [0.64–4.89]) (Fig 6D) compared to other groups.
Discussion
The mammalian order Xenarthra includes sloths, anteaters and armadillos. Armadillos are
observed only in the Americas, having ten known genera composed of 21 different species in
the wild, and are known reservoirs for a number of bacterial and parasitic pathogens, including
Mycobacteria, Trypanosoma, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Leptospirosis, Sporothrix, Chagas and
Paracoccidioides [35,36]. D. novemcinctus, commonly known as the nine-banded armadillo in
the U.S. or chicken-armadillo in Brazil, is the only species whose range includes North, Central
and South America [37], and are ground burrowers and opportunistic feeders (almost 500 sep-
arate food items, mostly insects, make up their diet). Nine-banded armadillos extended their

 range from Mexico into Texas some time during the 1800s, and then eventually increased
their range north and east into the gulf states of the southern U.S. [38]. In the early 1970s, it
was determined that armadillos were capable of sustaining the growth of M. leprae to ex-
tremely high bacillary loads (up to 1011 bacilli per gram of tissue), with around 80% of the ani-
mals showing some level of susceptibility to experimental infection [39]. Shortly after this, in
1975 it was discovered that wild armadillos living in Texas and Louisiana were naturally
infected with M. leprae, and serological studies of archived armadillo serum samples for anti-
PGL-I antibodies indicated that they had likely shown this biomarker of infection as early as
the 1960s. Other investigators, using different approaches to identify acid-fast bacilli by histo-
pathology, M. leprae DNA (such as RLEP sequence) by PCR or serological studies to show
anti-PGL-I antibody positivity revealed evidence of infection in armadillo species in a number
of countries in Central and South America, including Mexico [40], Colombia [41], and Argen-
tina [42]. In Brazil, several groups have reported the possibility of M. leprae infection in

 armadillos in different regions, including in the southeastern state of Espı
´rito Santo [43] and
more recently in the northeast in Ceara
´ state [44,45]. Another case control study indicated that
human contact with armadillos increased the risk of leprosy in Espı
´rito Santo, Brazil [46].
There was one previous study that examined whether the consumption of armadillo meat had
an effect on the incidence of leprosy, but no association was found [47]. However, this study
examined individuals living in the southern state of Parana
´, considered a medium endemic
area (<1 new case per 10,000 population), which is around fifty times lower than in the state of
Para
´, and there was no evidence presented that armadillos in this area were infected with M.
leprae. In a recent study of 98 marmosets captured from different regions of Brazil to look for
Ag85B and RLEP DNA by PCR, none were found to be positive by this method [48], although

 14 were found to be positive for rpoB, another mycobacterial genetic marker. Nevertheless, the
likelihood that environmental reservoirs, including armadillos, amoeba [49,50] and most
recently, red squirrels in Scotland and the U.K. [51,52], could play a role in M. leprae persis-
tence and transmission to humans has been increasingly cited as a real possibility [53], which
would necessitate a different approach to leprosy control and prevention.
Although the link between zoonotic M. leprae infection in armadillos and transmission of
these particular unique strain types to humans has been firmly established in the southern U.
S., the actual mechanism of transmission of M. leprae between armadillos and humans would
be difficult to determine because of the lack of being able to grow this species in vitro in axenic
medium. Possible routes of infection that have been proposed include inhalation of particles
of soil contaminated by infected armadillos during the process of gardening activity [54] or
from contact with contaminated soil or water samples in leprosy endemic areas [55–57]. The
evidence for transmission of M. leprae to humans from these environmental sources is some-
what circumstantial, and has relied mainly on the identification of certain genetic markers,
including SNP type and variable nucleotide tandem repeats (VNTR) found in M. leprae DNA
isolated from these sources and matching these with strain types existing in the human popula-
tion living in the same area. A more definitive transmission link between distinct SNP subtypes
circulating in armadillos and those found in human leprosy patients in the southern and
southeastern U.S. has been more rigorously confirmed by whole genome sequencing of M.
leprae from tissue or biopsy specimens [58,59], which is currently being pursued with samples
from Para
´, Brazil. Notably, in this study we used four different techniques to demonstrate the
presence of M. leprae in the armadillo tissue samples. First, PCR was used show RLEP positiv-
ity in 62% of the tissues sampled, with confirmation of a match of the RLEP sequence to that
already published; second, auramine/rhodamine and SYBR Gold staining showed positively
stained bacilli within histological sections, techniques specifically used to identify mycobacte-
ria in situ; third, the M. leprae-specific antigen, PGL-I, was localized in situ with a polyclonal
rabbit antibody; and finally by showing acid fast staining of bacilli in wild armadillo spleen sec-
tions by the Fite Faraco technique.

 The total number of new cases of leprosy in the U.S. has remained relatively constant at ~200
per year, while the new case detection rate in 2016 in Brazil of around 25,000 cases in 207 mil-
lion people translates to 1.2 per 10,000 population. Since armadillos occur at very high numbers
in many rural areas in Brazil and the new case detection rate in humans has been considered
hyperendemic in the Amazon region for a long time, it is extremely likely that the introduction
of M. leprae in armadillos due to interactions with infected humans is not a recent event, partic-
ularly as the percentage of infection in these animals exceeds that found in the southern U.S.
Due to the already high percentage of anti-PGL-I positivity in the general population, we
initially wondered whether exposure to armadillos would have a measurable effect on increas-
ing the rates of positivity of this biomarker of infection. However, recording the habits of some
of the families, we discovered certain practices that could dramatically influence exposure to
M. leprae from armadillos. Hunters in the villages who capture wild armadillos in the sur-
rounding forest sometimes bring the animals to their home alive where they are kept in an
enclosure inside the house for up to six months while being well-fed to increase their body
weight and sometimes even bathed like a pet. If an animal was infected and shedding bacilli,

frequency of consuming armadillos in the diet.

 this would greatly facilitate infection of individuals living in this dwelling via the aerosol route
[60]. Another risk of exposure to viable M. leprae would likely occur by killing the animal and
handling the meat for consumption, as blood or other tissue fluids could gain entry through
any cuts in the skin. Cooking the meat would effectively kill M. leprae bacilli and render infec-
tion by eating cooked meat a very low probability. However, another practice in certain areas
was for individuals to prepare a kind of raw liver and onion ceviche. Consumption of raw
meat, particularly the liver of armadillos, which is one of the main organs where M. leprae
growth is highest, would be considered a very high risk behavior and among the practices
most likely leading to successful infection. Although we did not see a significant increase in the
anti-PGL-I titer comparing groups of individuals who did or did not eat armadillos, the find-
ing that individuals who consumed armadillo meat frequently (more than once per month
and even up to twice per week) had a significantly higher titer indicates that this behavior has
an effect on the frequency of infection. Although capturing of wild armadillos for consumption
is prohibited in Brazil, it is obvious that a good percentage of people in poor rural areas enjoy
and utilize this source of dietary protein, and this preference would be hard to change even by
educating them about this potential source of M. leprae infection. In addition, the WHO has
only considered strategies for intervention and treatment of cases involving human-to-human
transmission. Interruption of infection by zoonotic transmission (armadillo-to-human) has
not been addressed, and would be a difficult challenge for the WHO [61]. Nevertheless, deter-
mining the extent of infection in these wild animals and applying whole genome sequencing to
identify strain types circulating in armadillos and human populations interacting with them is
important to clarify the relative risk that nonhuman reservoirs have in the transmission of this
(and perhaps other) tropical diseases and may help to improve strategies to combat leprosy.
