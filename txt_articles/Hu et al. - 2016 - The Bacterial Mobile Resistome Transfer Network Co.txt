ABSTRACT
Horizontally acquired antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in bacteria are highly mobile and have been ranked as principal risk
resistance determinants. However, the transfer network of the mobile resistome and the forces driving mobile ARG transfer are
largely unknown. Here, we present the whole profile of the mobile resistome in 23,425 bacterial genomes and explore the effects
of phylogeny and ecology on the recent transfer (>99% nucleotide identity) of mobile ARGs. We found that mobile ARGs are
mainly present in four bacterial phyla and are significantly enriched in Proteobacteria. The recent mobile ARG transfer network,
which comprises 703 bacterial species and 16,859 species pairs, is shaped by the bacterial phylogeny, while an ecological barrier
also exists, especially when interrogating bacteria colonizing different human body sites. Phylogeny is still a driving force for the
transfer of mobile ARGs between farm animals and the human gut, and, interestingly, the mobile ARGs that are shared between
the human and animal gut microbiomes are also harbored by diverse human pathogens. Taking these results together, we sug-
gest that phylogeny and ecology are complementary in shaping the bacterial mobile resistome and exert synergistic effects on the
development of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens.
IMPORTANCE
The development of antibiotic resistance threatens our modern medical achievements. The dissemination of antibiotic resis-
tance can be largely attributed to the transfer of bacterial mobile antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Revealing the transfer net-
work of these genes in bacteria and the forces driving the gene flow is of great importance for controlling and predicting the
emergence of antibiotic resistance in the clinic. Here, by analyzing tens of thousands of bacterial genomes and millions of human
and animal gut bacterial genes, we reveal that the transfer of mobile ARGs is mainly controlled by bacterial phylogeny but under
ecological constraints. We also found that dozens of ARGs are transferred between the human and animal gut and human patho-
gens. This work demonstrates the whole profile of mobile ARGs and their transfer network in bacteria and provides further in-
sight into the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance in nature.
A
ntibiotic resistance is a growing global threat to human public
health, and the continuing emergence of drug-resistant bac-
teria has led to the potential for a postantibiotic era (1). Bacteria
have evolved a dynamic array of antimicrobial resistance mecha-
nisms to withstand antibiotic attacks, such as altering drug tar-
get(s), synthesizing drug-inactivating enzymes, changing cell
membrane permeability, and exporting drugs via efflux pumps
(2). A large number of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) involved
in these resistance mechanisms have been discovered and are col-
lected in various ARG databases, including ARG-ANOTT (3),
CARD (4), ResFinder (5), and ARDB (6). Because antibiotic re-
sistance can be endogenous or exogenous, ARGs are generally
classified as intrinsic (chromosomally encoded in specific species
or genera) and acquired (via specific point mutations or horizon-
tal gene transfer [HGT]) ARGs (7). ResFinder is a repository of
ARGs that covers only the horizontally acquired ARGs but not the
resistance caused by mutations, according to public sources and
published papers (5).
ARGs, including the cryptic resistance genes in bacteria, have
been collectively referred to as the antibiotic resistome (8, 9), and,
accordingly, intrinsic and horizontally acquired ARGs have been
named the intrinsic resistome and the mobile resistome, respec-
tively (10, 11). In recent years, the antibiotic resistome from both
environmental and host-associated microbiomes has been ex-
plored (either function- or sequence-based), leading to the dis-
covery of numerous ARGs (8, 12–15). However, the risk of these
identified ARGs has been considered to be overestimated because
most studies have failed to differentiate between intrinsic ARGs
and mobile ARGs (16). The mobile ARGs that are frequently as-

 sociated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and disseminated
by HGT have been considered to have the highest risk of develop-
ing resistance among the antibiotic resistome (16).
HGT is considered a very important mechanism that contrib-
utes to bacterial genome mutability and evolution (17, 18). Re-
vealing associated factors, such as transfer barriers of HGT, has
been a continued research interest because significant adaptive
traits of bacteria such as virulence, beneficial metabolic properties,
and antibiotic resistance can be rapidly disseminated through
HGT. Phylogenetic, ecological, and functional barriers have all
been highlighted to exert an influence on HGT (19). Regarding
ARGs, bacterial phylogeny (20) and ecology (21, 22) both have
been shown to be driving forces that shape the antibiotic resis-
tome. Unfortunately, these studies targeted all ARGs but did not
focus on the mobile ones. An in-depth understanding of the
trends and barriers for HGT of the mobile resistome is undoubt-
edly essential for predicting the emergence of antibiotic resistance
in human pathogens.
To provide a comprehensive view of the mobile resistome in
bacteria and elucidate the forces shaping ARG transfer, we exam-
ined 23,425 bacterial genomes (including 2,768 complete ge-
nomes and 20,657 draft genomes available in August 2014 in
GenBank) for known mobile ARGs and analyzed their recent
HGT network and the roles of phylogeny and ecology in the trans-
fer of the mobile resistome. We also sequenced the gut micro-
biome of three representative farm animals and compared the
mobile ARGs we identified with those in the recently released
human gut gene catalog (approximately 9.8 million genes) (23) to
investigate the transfer of mobile ARGs at the bacterial commu-
nity level.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sets. A total of 23,425 bacterial genomes, including 2,768 complete
and 20,657 draft genomes (as of August 2014) and their taxonomic affil-
iations were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) GenBank. Concur-
rently, 1,680 mobile ARGs, including 88 van genes belonging to 19 van-
comycin resistance operons with a total of 2,134 nucleotide sequences,
were retrieved from the ResFinder database (5). Metadata defining the
“Ecosystem Category” and “Disease” status, among others, of the strains
were obtained from the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database
(http://img.jgi.doe.gov). A data set consisting of the mobility genes of
180,787 integrase/recombinase and transposase was generated by search-
ing the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) (24) Uniref90 database us-
ing corresponding keywords; the data set was subsequently used to search
the flanking regions of the mobile ARGs, which we termed the adjacent
mobility genes. The human gut microbiome integrated gene catalog
(IGC) (9,879,896 genes) and the separate European gene catalog (EGC)
(8,096,991 genes), Chinese gene catalog (CGC) (3,547,396 genes), and
American gene catalog (AGC) (2,681,342 genes), as well as the Gene Tax-
onomic Assignment Profiles, were downloaded from the GigaScience Da-
tabase (http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100064). The 889 reference bacterial
genomes of different human body sites (airways, blood, gastrointestinal
tract, oral cavity, skin, and urogenital tract) from the Human Microbiome
Project (HMP) were downloaded from the Data Analysis and Coordina-
tion Center (DACC) (http://hmpdacc.org). The three animal gut gene
data sets were generated as described below.
Searching for mobile ARGs and evaluating ARG diversity. To search
for mobile ARGs, the bacterial genomes and the animal and human gut
microbiome gene sets were subjected to BLAST using the mobile ARGs in
the ResFinder database (5). To guarantee that the ARGs we annotated
were accurate and homologous, we used a relatively strict cutoff value of
�95% nucleotide identity and �90% coverage for the BLAST search, a
criterion that has also been adopted to establish gene catalogues such as
those for the human gut microbiome (23, 25). The Mann-Whitney U test
was used for statistical comparisons of the median number of mobile
ARGs contained in species from different phyla.
For the vancomycin resistance Van operons consisting of more than
one structural gene, for example, the vanB operon consisting of the struc-
tural genes vanAB, vanHB, vanRB, vanSB, vanWB, vanXB, and vanYB, only
if at least three-fourths of the structural genes were presented simultane-
ously, was it deemed to be a real mobile van operon, and the operon was
regarded as a single gene when the mobile ARG number was counted and
in the subsequent analyses.
To evaluate the diversity of mobile ARGs in individual bacterial spe-
cies, a rarefaction curve plotting the observed number of mobile ARGs
against the number of genomes in each species was generated. Only those
species with more than 50 genome sequences and �10 genomes contain-
ing mobile ARGs were used to generate the curve.
Analysis of the ARG cluster and the adjacent mobility genes. To de-
termine which mobile ARGs were adjacent to each other in a specific
region of a genome and to what extent they were associated with MGEs,
we searched the flanking regions of each mobile ARG for adjacent ARGs
or mobility genes such as integrase/recombinase and/or transposase. First,
we selected fragments containing the mobile ARGs and both their up-
stream and downstream 5-kb flanking regions in each bacterial genome;
then, if an ARG was adjacent to another ARG (�5 kb), the overlapping
regions were merged to generate a longer fragment harboring the two
mobile ARGs, the two ARGs were considered to be clustered together
(ARG cluster containing 2 mobile ARGs), and this process was repeated.
The mobility genes were found with protein homology of �70% protein
identity using the long fragments that contained clustered ARGs. If ob-
served within this search parameter, they were considered to be adjacent
to mobile ARGs.
Determination of the recent HGT of the mobile ARGs and the HGT
frequency. A stringent cutoff of �99% nucleotide identity was used to
determine the recent HGT of the mobile ARGs between species pairs (20,
21). That is, if a mobile ARG was shared between two species with �99%
nucleotide identity, the ARG was considered to be a recent HGT. The
HGT number of a species was defined as the number of ARGs shared
between this species and all others. To calculate the intra- and intertaxon
HGT frequencies of the mobile ARGs, the intra- and intertaxon HGT
numbers of a species were counted separately, and the intra- and inter-
taxon HGT frequencies were calculated by dividing the HGT number of a
species by the total number of species containing the mobile ARGs within
and outside the taxon, respectively. For cross-ecology analysis, the strains
were first assigned to different ecological categories according to the iso-
lation source. Subsequently, the intracategory (eco_same) and intercat-
egory (eco_diff) HGT frequencies in the same taxon (taxon_same) and in
different taxa (taxon_diff) were calculated separately, generating the HGT
frequencies in four combinations: taxon_same and eco_same, taxon_
same and eco_diff, taxon_diff and eco_same, and taxon_diff and eco_diff.
Cross-body site analysis was done using the intracategory and intercat-
egory HGT frequencies, and results were calculated along the strain’s phy-
logenetic distance with the maximum of 2% 16S rRNA gene sequence
divergence. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine significant
differences between the medians of the HGT frequencies among different
groups.
Definition of environments/pathogens. The environment and
pathogenicity information for all genomes were obtained from IMG. We
generalized the environment information into four categories via the
“Ecosystem” and “Ecosystem category” tokens: env_aqua, ecosystem “En-
vironment” and ecosystem category “Aquatic”; env_terr, ecosystem “En-
vironment” and ecosystem category “Terrestrial”; host_homo, ecosystem
“Host-associated” and ecosystem category “Human”; and host_anim,
ecosystem “Host-associated” and ecosystem category “Animal,” “Mam-
mals” or “Birds.” The pathogenicity information of genomes was ex-
tracted via the “Diseases,” “Phenotype,” and “Relevance” tokens. If any

 token had a defined “patho-” as a defined keyword, the genome was con-
sidered to be pathogenic. The HGT frequencies of the mobile ARGs across
phylogenetic hierarchies and across different environments were calcu-
lated as described above.
Sequencing animal gut microbiomes. Fresh stool samples from
chickens, pigs, and cattle were collected from suburban farms in Beijing,
China. The samples were collected and subsequently used for DNA ex-
traction with the PSP Spin Stool DNA Plus kit according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Paired-end Illumina sequencing DNA libraries with
an insertion length of 350 to 400 bp (4 samples each for chickens and pigs
and 5 samples for cattle) were constructed following the manufacturer’s
instructions (Illumina), followed by sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq
2000 platform to generate approximately 5 G of data for each sample (see
Table S1 in the supplemental material). The raw reads were trimmed until
three contiguous bases with a quality of �20 were found, and all read
lengths shorter than 50 bp were discarded.
Sequence assembly and gene prediction. High-quality reads were as-
sembled using the SOAPdenovo program (http://soap.genomics.org.cn)
with automatic determination of the K-mer size; the resulting contigs
shorter than 200 bp were discarded. Coding sequence (CDS) extraction
was performed using MetaGeneAnnotator (26), and only those CDSs of
�100 bp were retained for further analysis. The CDSs from chickens, pigs,
and cattle were pooled, respectively, into nonredundant data sets using
CD-HIT as described by Qin et al. (25).
Taxonomic classification of metagenomic sequences. The nonre-
dundant CDS sequences were first aligned with the NCBI nonredundant
protein database using NCBI BLAST. The tabular results were analyzed
using MEGAN (27) for the assignment of taxonomy. Spearman correla-
tions were used to test the similarity of community structures between gut
microbiomes, and Pearson correlations were used to examine the rela-
tionship between the similarity of community structures and the number
of mobile genes shared between the communities.
Accession number(s). All sequencing data were deposited in the
NCBI Sequence Read Archive database under accession number
SRP062937.
RESULTS
Mobile ARGs are enriched in Proteobacteria. Using a nucleotide
identity cutoff value of �95% for the BLAST search against the
ResFinder database, we identified a total of 515 mobile ARGs dis-
tributed across 790 species among 6,335 bacterial species (Fig. 1;
see also Data Set S1A in the supplemental material). These mobile
ARGs were mainly harbored by four bacterial phyla: Proteobacte-
ria (399 genes), Firmicutes (86 genes), Bacteroidetes (46 genes),
and Actinobacteria (40 genes); a small portion of the ARGs were
shared among these phyla (see below). A comparison of the num-
ber of mobile ARGs harbored by each bacterial species showed
that Proteobacteria species were highly enriched with mobile
ARGs (P � 2.9 � 10�4, Mann-Whitney U test) compared with all
species in the other three phyla. In detail, among 16 species that
harbored more than 20 mobile ARGs, 10 species belonged to the
phylum Proteobacteria, and, most importantly, 7 of these species
harboring more than 40 mobile ARGs were all from Proteobacte-
ria. In addition, the rarefaction curves showed that the ARG di-
versity in proteobacterial bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae
(119 mobile ARGs) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (49 mobile
ARGs) were far from saturation (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material).
Mobile ARGs are frequently associated with MGEs. To deter-
mine which mobile ARGs clustered together in a specific region of
a genome and to what extent they were associated with MGEs, we

 searched the 5-kb flanking regions of each mobile ARG for adja-
cent mobile ARGs or integrase/recombinase and/or transposase
(see Materials and Methods). We observed that ARG clusters con-
taining 1, 2, and 3 mobile ARGs (19,569, 4,999, and 1,636 occur-
rences, respectively, in all genomes) accounted for the vast major-
ity of the total ARG clusters, while ARG clusters containing more
than 3 mobile ARGs accounted for a small proportion (656 occur-
rences) (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material), suggesting
that long multigene-containing ARG clusters are not frequently
present in bacteria. Furthermore, 67.3% of the total ARG clusters
(single gene or multigene) were associated with known mobility-
associated genes such as integrase/recombinase and/or trans-
posase, and most ARG clusters coexisted with both integrase/
recombinase and transposase genes (see Fig. S2B in the supple-
mental material). In addition, the occurrence of mobility-associ-
ated genes increased with the number of mobile ARGs in the ARG
cluster. These results emphasized the contribution of mobility-
associated genes to the transfer of mobile ARGs.
ARGs that are clustered within an MGE in a bacterial genome
are usually referred to as resistance islands (RIs) (28). We found a
total of 656 ARG clusters, presumably potential RIs, each contain-
ing at least four different acquired ARGs (data not shown). The
largest cluster containing 18 mobile ARGs was located in the larg-
est resistance island known to date, AbaR1 (86-kb), which was
discovered in Acinetobacter baumannii strain AYE (29); the sec-
ond largest one harboring 12 ARGs was from the plasmid of a
highly invasive and resistant zoonotic pathogen, Salmonella en-
terica serovar Choleraesuis (30); and the third was from K. pneu-
moniae MGH 43 (JCNT01000000). Among all ARG clusters, the
sulfonamide resistance gene sul1, which is always associated with
class 1 integrons, was observed in the neighborhood with the
greatest number of different types of ARGs (99 different ARGs).
This association reflects not only the widespread presence of class
1 integrons in resistance islands but also their important role in
acquiring and disseminating ARGs in bacteria (31).

recently horizontally transferred ARGs, we compared all 515 of
the mobile ARGs obtained from the genomes using a cutoff of
�99% nucleotide identity (20, 21), and an HGT network of these
mobile ARGs at the species level (703 nodes, 16,859 species pairs)
was generated (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental material). In gen-
eral, the recent exchanges of the mobile ARGs were mainly de-
tected in Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobac-
teria, and the exchanges were more active in Proteobacteria (see
Fig. S3B in the supplemental material). We found a total of 11
species that each shared at least one mobile ARG with more than
200 other species. The top three species displaying the highest
numbers of connections were E. coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and
Staphylococcus aureus, which shared ARGs with 302, 266, and 260
species, respectively. Moreover, among 16,859 species pairs, 1,376
shared at least three different mobile ARGs (Fig. 2A). E. coli and K.
pneumoniae shared the largest number of mobile ARGs (60 indi-
vidual genes), followed by E. coli and S. enterica (38 genes), A.
baumannii and K. pneumoniae (38 genes), and Klebsiella oxytoca
and K. pneumoniae (36 genes) (see Data Set S1B in the supplemen-
tal material).
Next, we added to the network all 222 mobile ARGs that were
transferred mutually between at least two different species (Fig.
2B). The tetracycline resistance genes, tet(M) and tet(Q), and the
integron-associated sulfonamide resistance gene, sul1, were the

 top three widely transferred mobile ARGs at the species level (see
Data Set S2 in the supplemental material), while tet(C), tet(W),
and sul1 were the top three at the genus level. Notably, a total of 37
mobile ARGs had been found transferred, even between different
phyla. The exchanges of tet(C) and blaTEM-116 genes spanned seven
and six different phyla, respectively, and aph(3=)-III, catA1, and
erm(B) were all transferred across five different phyla. These re-
sults revealed that mobile ARGs are frequently transferred be-
tween not only closely related bacteria but also phylogenetically
distant species. However, a preferred exchange pattern of the re-
cently exchanged mobile ARGs was found along the bacterial lin-
eage (Fig. 2B). For examples, tet(Q), erm(F), and cfxA5 were trans-
ferred solely within Bacteroidetes, tet(M), tet(O), and erm(B) were
mainly transferred in Firmicutes, and sul1, sul2, strA, and strB were
mainly transferred in Proteobacteria, suggesting that there is a po-
tential phylogenetic barrier for HGT of the mobile resistome.
The recent HGT network of mobile ARGs is mainly shaped
by bacterial phylogeny. To test the phylogenetic barrier predic-
tion, we computed the HGT frequency of the mobile ARGs at
different phylogenetic hierarchies (see Materials and Methods).
As expected, the intrataxon HGT frequency of the mobile ARGs
was significantly higher than the intertaxon HGT frequency at
each phylogenetic level (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material),
which suggests the presence of a strong phylogenetic barrier. We
further explored the ecological impact on mobile ARG transfer by
comparing the HGT frequency across ecologies (human, animal,
aquatic, and terrestrial) and across phylogenetic hierarchies. We
found that at each phylogenetic level, the HGT frequencies of the
mobile ARGs between strains with the same phylogenetic taxa
(whether eco_same or eco_diff) were significantly higher than
those with different phylogenetic taxa (whether eco_same or
eco_diff); in contrast, the HGT frequencies in strains from the
same ecology were only slightly higher than those from different
ecologies (e.g., mean values of 26.4% versus 22.8% at the phylum
level) (Fig. 3A). To avoid bias introduced by summarizing the
ecological affiliation of bacteria according to the general descrip-
tions of bacterial sources in the database, we next analyzed the
HMP data set comprising 889 reference bacterial genomes with
defined sources of different human body sites. We also analyzed
the HGT frequency over a range of bacterial phylogenetic dis-
tances for these genomes. We found that phylogeny played a lead-
ing role in the recent ARG transfer; that is, the closer the 16S
distance of the strains, the more frequently the transfer occurred
(Fig. 3B). However, the HGT frequency was observably higher
between strains from the same body site than for those from dif-
ferent body sites, especially when the strains reached approxi-
mately more than 90% 16S identity (Fig. 3B). Taking our results
together, we suggest that bacterial phylogeny dominates the recent
HGT network of the mobile resistome, but existing ecological bar-
riers also supply a contribution.

 transfer in strains with different origins (restricted to those with
defined isolation sources). Among strains that were either human-
or animal-associated, approximately 35% carried mobile ARGs,
while the ratio was relatively low for strains of aquatic or terrestrial
origin at only approximately 5% (see Fig. S5A in the supplemental
material). Furthermore, among the strains with human and ani-
mal origins carrying mobile ARGs, 98% and 95% shared mobile
ARGs with strains from other sources, respectively, while the ra-
tios were 88% and 64% for aquatic and terrestrial isolations, re-
spectively. The HGT frequency of the mobile ARGs in animal-
associated bacteria was the highest, followed by human, aquatic,
and terrestrial bacteria (see Fig. S5B in the supplemental material).
Interestingly, the mobile ARGs were exchanged most frequently
between animal and human bacteria, followed by exchanges be-
tween animal and aquatic bacteria and then between animal and
terrestrial bacteria (see Fig. S5C in the supplemental material).
These findings may indicate that animal bacteria represent a more
powerful mobile ARG pool that can impact both human and en-
vironmental mobile resistomes.
To further investigate the shared mobile ARGs between ani-
mals and humans at the bacterial community level, we focused on
gut bacteria as an example and sequenced the gut microbiomes of
three representative farm animals, including chickens, pigs, and
cattle (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) and compared
the mobile ARGs in these microbiomes with the integrated gene
catalog (IGC) of the human gut microbiome (approximately 9.8
million genes) (23). We found that the recent mobile ARG trans-
fer (�99% nucleotide identity) indeed occurred between human
and animal gut microbiomes and, most intriguingly, that the hu-
man IGC shared the most mobile ARGs with the chicken gut mi-
crobiome (36 genes) and the fewest with the cattle gut micro-
biome (10 genes) (see Fig. S6A in the supplemental material).
Because the animals sequenced herein were all from China, to
investigate whether a country-specific ARG transfer occurred be-
tween animals and humans, we constructed a network using sep-
arated data sets of the European gene catalog (EGC), Chinese gene
catalog (CGC), and American gene catalog (AGC) and the ani-
mals. The results showed that the EGC and CGC shared the largest
numbers of mobile ARGs (69 genes), but, unexpectedly, each of
the three gene catalogs still shared more mobile ARGs with the
chicken gut microbiome than with the gut microbiomes of the
other animals (see Fig. S6B in the supplemental material).
We further computed the correlation between the similarity of
the bacterial community structure (reflecting the phylogenetic
similarity between bacterial communities) and the shared gene
number. Regarding the relative abundances at both the phylum
and genus levels, the microbiome profile of any of the three hu-
man gut microbiomes was more similar to that of chickens than of
pigs or cattle (Fig. 4A and B), and positive correlations (Pearson’s
r � 0.512 [P � 0.051] and 0.778 [P � 6.4 � 10�4]) at the (phylum
and genus levels, respectively) were observed for the similarities of
community structures (Spearman correlation) and the numbers
of shared genes (Fig. 4C and D). These results suggest that, at the
levels of bacterial communities that are not closely ecologically
connected, bacterial phylogeny may also contribute to the transfer
of the mobile resistome, although there is a possibility that some of
the shared mobile ARGs we observed were caused by the exchange
of bacteria.

 Mobile ARGs shared between the human and animal gut mi-
crobiomes are also harbored by human pathogens. We found a
total of 84 mobile ARGs that were shared between at least two gut
data sets (Fig. 5A). Among them, 41 genes were recently trans-
ferred between human and animal guts (human-animal-shared
mobile ARGs). These human-animal-shared mobile ARGs cov-
ered six major antibiotic classes, including tetracyclines (11
genes), aminoglycosides (10 genes), macrolide-lincosamide-
streptogramin B (MLSB) (9 genes), chloramphenicols (5 genes),
beta-lactams (3 genes), and sulfonamides (3 genes) (see Data Set
S3 in the supplemental material). In addition, 11 mobile ARGs
were shared among all six gut data sets, among which 7 were tet-
racycline resistance genes, indicating that the transfer of tetracy-
cline resistance genes is more common between human and
animals.
We further examined 2,613 genomes of the human-associated
pathogens (see Materials and Methods) for human-animal-
shared mobile ARGs (�99% nucleotide identity). Interestingly,
we found that 33 of the 41 shared mobile ARGs were harbored by
various human pathogens or opportunistic pathogens worldwide,
spanning 47 species and 403 genomes (see Data Set S4 in the sup-
plemental material). The tetracycline resistance gene tet(M) was
the most widely distributed; it was detected in 13 species and was
overrepresented in Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococ-
cus) isolates (95 genomes). The latter is a causative agent for a
wide range of human diseases, especially in newborns (32). S.
agalactiae, E. coli, and Streptococcus suis were the top three species
harboring the greatest number of ARGs (eight genes each) that
were shared between human and animal guts. These pathogen-
carried human-animal-shared mobile ARGs were moved via
different mobile genetic elements, as reflected by the different re-
gions surrounding the same genes and the nearby mobility-asso-
ciated genes. For example, the MLSB resistance gene erm(F)
shared between cattle and humans was also carried by pathogens
such as Bibersteinia trehalosi 192 and by known MGEs such as the
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron transposon CTnDOT (Fig. 5B). The
genetic environments of erm(F) differed between different bacte-
rial hosts, and the gene was frequently flanked by other ARGs as
well as different genes that facilitate the transfer process, such as
integrase and transposase, indicating that the gene has been sub-
jected to various recombination events. A similar phenomenon
has been observed for the aminoglycoside resistance gene ant(6)-
Ia, which is shared between pig and human guts (Fig. 5C), empha-
sizing the contributions of MGEs to the mobility of mobile ARGs.
Taken together, our results provide evidence for the recent ex-
change of mobile ARGs among human, animal, and clinical
pathogens, although we are uncertain about the directions of the
transfers.
DISCUSSION
Our analysis showed that both the abundance and the HGT fre-
quency of the mobile ARGs were overrepresented in Proteobacte-
ria, and this finding was largely in accordance with our previous
analysis showing that in the human gut microbiota, compared
with other genes, ARGs are more enriched in Proteobacteria (13).
An excessive number of ARGs carried by Proteobacteria may par-
tially explain the expansion of this group in human and mouse gut
microbiomes following exposure to antibiotics (33, 34). It is also
interesting to note that a large majority of antibiotic-subsisting
soil bacteria belong to the Proteobacteria (87% clonal isolates, each
resistant to multiple antibiotics) (35). Taken together, these re-
sults suggest that Proteobacteria probably constitute a major ARG
pool, potentially even a mobile ARG pool in nature, regardless of
the origin of their ARGs. The enrichment of mobile ARGs in Pro-
teobacteria can be interpreted in part by the fact that many human
clinical pathogens are Proteobacteria (36), which presumably
faced more antibiotic selection pressures due to clinical treat-
ments.
It is reasonable to deduce that the recent transfer of the mobile
resistome is generally under ecological constraint; the success of
HGT depends on contact between the donor and recipient resid-
ing in the same niche (37). This trend is clearly demonstrated by
our analysis targeting bacterial communities from different sites
in the human body. However, the mobile ARG transfers are clearly
controlled by bacterial phylogeny regardless of whether the ecol-
ogy (or the body site) is the same or not (Fig. 3). This observation
was consistent when we assessed mobile ARG exchange between
animal and human gut microbiomes (Fig. 4). These findings sug-
gest that mobile ARGs have a tendency to spread among phyloge-
netically closely related bacteria; i.e., phylogenetic evolutionary
pressure may be a primary force that structures the bacterial mo-
bile resistome. Therefore, we propose that antibiotic exposure is
the source of selection, ecology provides a physical barrier, and
phylogeny determines the HGT network of the mobile resistome.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the sharing of mobile ARGs
between different ecosystems (microbiomes) was caused by the
exchange of bacteria harboring mobile ARGs; however, we pro-
pose that once the ecological barrier is overcome, the mobile
ARGs were primarily expanded among phylogenetically similar
populations.
Our analysis indicated that not only the number of bacteria
harboring mobile ARGs but also the HGT frequency of the ARGs
between animal-associated bacteria is higher than those for bac-
teria of human and environmental origins (see Fig. S5A and B in
the supplemental material). One consideration, from the world-
wide ecological view, is that bacteria of animal origin may face
more antibiotic selection pressure because more antibiotics
(nearly 80% in the United States [38]) are consumed by animals as
growth promoters, infection prevention, and clinical treatments.
The high exchange frequency of mobile ARGs between animals
and humans or environmental bacteria is also noteworthy (see
Fig. S5C in the supplemental material). Because we were unable to
distinguish the direction of ARG transfer, we are not certain if this
is a hint that the animal-associated bacteria have a larger contri-
bution to the dissemination of ARGs to humans and the environ-
ment. However, evidence of the transfer of ARGs from animal
bacteria to humans and the environment has been published else-
where (39–41). It has also been suggested that the use of antibiot-
ics in animals has contributed to the emergence of ARGs in human
gut microbiomes (14, 42). However, if the use of antibiotics in
animals leads to the dissemination of mobile ARGs to humans and
the environment, we speculate that there would be fewer mobile
ARGs in “organically” raised farm animals that are not subjected
to routine antibiotic exposure than in traditionally raised farm
animals. A future comparison of the resistome in animals with
different husbandry with that of the human microbiome will pro-
vide more information regarding the transfer of ARGs among
different ecological niches.

criminating between intrinsic and mobile ARGs) in metagenomes

 emphasized that the ARGs discovered represent a high risk for
human pathogens because of HGT (8, 15, 43, 44). As suggested,
however, if every gene indicates a risk, there are no differential
risks and no workable interventions (16). Here, we focused on the
mobile resistome and showed that identical mobile ARGs were
shared between animal and human gut microbiomes and human
pathogens, supporting the occurrence of real ARG transfers or
bacterial exchange events, although we remain uncertain about
the routes for spreading.
Very recently, a new mobile ARG, named mcr-1, encoding re-
sistance to colistin, was found in animals and patients in China
(45). We were surprised to find that this new, emerging mobile
ARG has been transferred to the healthy Chinese human gut mi-
crobiota through a potential food chain dissemination pathway
(46), which is more likely the case for several other mobile ARGs
that are shared between the animals and humans we observed in
this study. In addition, mcr-1 is currently found in or circulated
among E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and S. enterica, which supports our
results that the mobile ARGs are exchanged most frequently
among these three bacterial species (Fig. 2A; see also Data Set S1B
in the supplemental material). As demonstrated in the ARG trans-
fer network, a considerable amount of exchange of mobile ARGs
occurs between K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii. We speculate
that A. baumannii may become the next mcr-1 carrier.
Finally, the HGT network of the mobile ARGs presented here
was most likely formed by gene flow from a common mobile ARG
reservoir and less likely by direct gene exchange, for the bacteria or
microbiomes used for analysis were not in physical proximity to
each other. Therefore, the observations point to the commonali-
ties among different populations to be exposed to the source. Al-
though statistical normalization was considered when we pro-
cessed the genome data, we cannot exclude a potential bias in our
results due to the database bias and lack of specific organisms
within public resources. For example, more antibiotic resistance
genes and more genomes from human and animal pathogens are
included in the databases than are those from commensal or en-
vironmental bacteria. This may lead to, for example, an overrep-
resentation of mobile ARGs in Proteobacteria and an overestima-
tion of the exchange of mobile ARGs between human and animal.
However, we believe that the distribution of mobile ARGs in bac-
teria and the phylogeny-driven, ecology-constrained features of
mobile ARG transfer largely reflect the real situation in nature.
Because (i) all of the known genomes included herein, particularly
the drug-resistant ones, are representative of current antibiotic
resistance profiles, (ii) the mobile ARG transfer analysis is rela-
tively less susceptible to database bias, as we showed that, at each
phylogenetic level, the intrataxon HGT frequency of the mobile
ARGs was significantly higher than the intertaxon HGT fre-
quency, regardless of whether the ecology was the same, and (iii)
the intention was to reduce bias from the unevenly sampled ge-
nomes in the different habitats, we investigated the ARG transfer
within a single ecology (i.e., human body), and we obtained sim-
ilar results that led to the same conclusions. Overall, large genome
sequencing efforts are still needed to reduce the database bias and
thus contribute to elucidating the detailed profiles of the mobile
ARG transfer network among bacteria and microbiomes.
