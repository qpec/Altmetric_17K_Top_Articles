At its June 2016 meeting, the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of 
meningococcal conjugate vaccine (serogroups A, C, W, and 
Y; including MenACWY-D [Menactra, Sanofi Pasteur] or 
MenACWY-CRM [Menveo, GlaxoSmithKline]) for persons 
aged ≥2 months with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection. ACIP has previously recommended routine vacci-
nation of persons aged ≥2 months who have certain medical 
conditions that increase risk for meningococcal disease (1), 
including persons who have persistent (e.g., genetic) deficien-
cies in the complement pathway (e.g., C3, properdin, Factor D, 
Factor H, or C5–C9); persons receiving eculizumab (Soliris, 
Alexion Pharmaceuticals) for treatment of atypical hemolytic 
uremic syndrome or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria 
(because the drug binds C5 and inhibits the terminal comple-
ment pathway); and persons with functional or anatomic 
asplenia (including persons with sickle cell disease). Routine 
vaccination with meningococcal conjugate vaccine is also 
recommended for all healthy adolescents in the United States 
(1). This report summarizes the evidence considered by ACIP 
in recommending vaccination for HIV-infected persons, and 
provides recommendations and guidance for use of menin-
gococcal conjugate vaccines (serogroups A, C, W, and Y) 
among HIV-infected persons aged ≥2 months; the majority of 
meningococcal disease among HIV-infected persons is caused 
by these four serogroups.
Methods
The ACIP Meningococcal Vaccines Work Group reviewed 
the immunogenicity and safety data from two studies of 
MenACWY-D in HIV-infected persons (2–4) during monthly 
teleconferences. No studies of immunogenicity or safety of 
MenACWY-CRM in HIV-infected persons are available. 
According to a nonsystematic literature search of PubMed 
using the search terms “meningococcal conjugate vaccine,” 
“quadrivalent,” and “HIV,” and consultation with the manu-
facturers, these two studies represent all known evidence for the 
immunogenicity and safety of these vaccines in HIV-infected 
persons. The work group also evaluated the evidence and 
unpublished surveillance data regarding meningococcal disease 
epidemiology among HIV-infected persons in the United 
States and a cost-effectiveness analysis of routine vaccination 
of HIV-infected persons. The cost-effectiveness analysis of 
routine vaccination versus no vaccination of HIV-infected 
persons was conducted assuming an initial vaccine efficacy 
of 75% (range = 37%–91%) for persons with a high CD4 
count and 37% (range = 24%–60%) for persons with a low 
CD4 count based on the immunogenicity data reported in 
the literature for MenACWY-D (2–4). A summary of the 
data reviewed and work group discussions was presented to 
ACIP; recommendations for use of meningococcal conjugate 
vaccines among HIV-infected persons aged ≥2 months were 
approved by ACIP at its June 22, 2016 meeting (detailed meet-
ing minutes are available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/
meetings/meetings-info.html).
CDC vaccine recommendations are developed using the 
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, 
and Evaluation (GRADE) framework (http://www.cdc.gov/
vaccines/acip/recs/grade/index.html). The type and quality of 
available evidence supporting the use of meningococcal con-
jugate vaccines among HIV-infected persons aged ≥2 months 
were evaluated using GRADE. There is no available evidence 
for safety or effectiveness of these vaccines in HIV-infected 
persons aged <2 years or ≥25 years.

Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, 
adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory Commit-
tee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a 
federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and 
guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) on use of vaccines and related agents for the 
control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population 
of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines 
in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent 
possible with recommendations made by the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physi-
cians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vac-
cines in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP
, 
ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP 
recommendations approved by the CDC Director become agency 
guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality 
Weekly Report (MMWR). Additional information is available at

Meningococcal Disease in HIV-Infected Persons
Surveillance data for cases of meningococcal disease among 
HIV-infected persons in the United States are limited. The 
HIV status of patients with meningococcal disease is rou-
tinely captured in Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs), 
an active population-based and laboratory-based surveillance 
system that operates in 10 sites, representing a population 
of approximately 43 million persons, or 14% of the U.S. 
population (5). However, the HIV status of patients with 
meningococcal disease is not reported through the National 
Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), a passive 
surveillance system that operates in all U.S. states and territo-
ries. During 1995–2014, a total of 62 cases of meningococcal 
disease among HIV-infected persons were reported to ABCs; 
these cases represent 2% of the 3,951 meningococcal disease 
cases reported to ABCs during that period (CDC, unpublished 
data, 2016). Thirteen (21%) cases were serogroup B, 23 (37%) 
were serogroup C, three (5%) were serogroup W, 17 (27%) 
were serogroup Y, and six (10%) were other/unknown sero-
groups (CDC, unpublished data, 2016). The majority (92%) 
of cases of meningococcal disease among HIV-infected persons 
occurred in adults aged 20 through 59 years.
Although surveillance data for cases of meningococcal dis-
ease among HIV-infected persons are limited in the United 
States, a growing body of evidence demonstrates an increased 
risk for meningococcal disease among HIV-infected persons. 
In studies from South Africa, the United States, and the 
United Kingdom, the incidence of meningococcal disease in 
HIV-infected persons ranged from 3.4 to 6.6 per 100,000 
(relative risk = 5–13 compared with HIV-uninfected persons) 
(Table 1) (6–9). Among HIV-infected persons, a low CD4 
count or high viral load were associated with an increased 
risk (7). Similar increased risk for meningococcal disease was 
observed for both males and females with HIV infection (7,9).
Data on the case-fatality ratio of meningococcal disease in 
HIV-infected persons vary: in the South Africa study, the case-
fatality ratio among HIV-infected patients was 20%, compared 
with 11% among patients who did not have HIV infection (6). 
However, in the most recent studies from New York City and 
the United Kingdom, the meningococcal disease case fatality 
ratio observed among HIV-infected patients was lower than 
that among HIV-uninfected patients (7,8).
MenACWY-D Immunogenicity and Safety in 
HIV-Infected Persons
The immunogenicity and safety of MenACWY-D in 324 
HIV-infected adolescents and young adults aged 11 through 
24 years were evaluated in an open-label trial with a random-
ized second dose component (2,4). At study entry, participants 
received 1 dose of MenACWY-D. At 24 weeks, participants 
with CD4 percentage (the percentage of total lymphocytes that 
are CD4 cells) (CD4%) ≥15% were randomized to receive or 
not receive a second dose of MenACWY-D; all participants 
with CD4% <15% received a second dose. Vaccine effective-
ness was inferred from serum bactericidal antibodies, measured 
using a serum bactericidal assay with a rabbit complement

source (rSBA). Rates of seroresponse (proportion of subjects 
with a ≥fourfold rise in rSBA titer compared with the baseline 
titer) against each meningococcal serogroup (A, C, W, Y), geo-
metric mean titers (GMT), and the percentage of subjects with 
rSBA at or above a predefined titer (≥1:128) were determined 
from sera obtained at study entry and at weeks 4, 24, 28, and 
72. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed for 6 weeks after each 
MenACWY-D dose through active follow-up (2,4).
Among participants with CD4% ≥15% who received 
1 vaccine dose, the proportions of participants with rSBA 
titers ≥1:128 at 4, 28, and 72 weeks were 65%, 31%, and 
21%, respectively, against serogroup C, and 83%, 75%, 63%, 
respectively, against serogroup Y (2). Among participants 
with CD4% ≥15% who received 2 doses (at 0, 24 weeks), the 
proportions of participants with rSBA titers ≥1:128 at 4, 28, 
and 72 weeks were 59%, 64%, and 35%, respectively, against 
serogroup C; and 73%, 83%, 71%, respectively, against sero-
group Y (2). Among participants with CD4% <15%, all of 
whom received 2 doses (at 0, 24 weeks), the proportions of 
participants with rSBA titers ≥1:128 at 4, 28, and 72 weeks 
were 22%, 22%, and 6%, respectively, against serogroup C, 
and 30%, 30%, 28%, respectively, against serogroup Y (2). 
A serious AE was experienced by 2.2%–6.5% of participants 
through 6 weeks post-vaccination*; one serious AE (ocular 
pain) was judged to be related to MenACWY-D. Serious AE 
rates were inversely related to entry CD4%. Two deaths were 
reported, but both were determined to be unrelated to the 
vaccine (2,4).
The immunogenicity and safety of MenACWY-D in 59 
HIV-infected children aged 2 through 10 years with CD4% 
≥25% was evaluated in an open label trial (3). Participants 
received MenACWY-D at study entry and at week 24. Vaccine 
effectiveness was inferred from serum bactericidal antibodies, 
measured using a serum bactericidal assay with rSBA. Rates of 
seroresponse (proportion of subjects with a ≥fourfold rise in 
post-vaccination rSBA titer compared with the baseline titer) 
against each meningococcal serogroup (A, C, W, Y), GMTs, 
and the percentage of subjects with rSBA at or above a pre-
defined titer (≥1:128) were determined from sera obtained at 
entry and weeks 4, 24, 28, and 72. Study participants were 
assessed for AEs 6 weeks after each MenACWY-D dose (3).
The proportion of participants with rSBA titers ≥1:128 
after 1 dose (week 4) and 2 doses (week 28) of MenACWY-D 
were 96% and 96%, respectively, for serogroup A, 49% and 
80%, respectively, for serogroup C, 98% and 100%, respec-
tively, for serogroup W, and 90% and 98%, respectively, for 
serogroup Y (3). At week 72 the proportions of participants 
with rSBA titers ≥1:128 were 80% for serogroup A, 45% for 
serogroup C, 95% for serogroup W, and 91% for serogroup Y 
(3). Overall, 5% of participants reported a serious AE; no AE 
was judged to be related to MenACWY-D (3).
Evidence supporting the use of meningococcal conjugate 
vaccines in HIV-infected persons was evaluated using the 
GRADE framework and was determined to be type 3 (low level 
of evidence) (Table 2). The recommendation was designated 
as Category A (recommended for all persons in an age-based 
or risk factor–based group) because of the epidemiologic data 
supporting an increase in risk for meningococcal disease among 
HIV-infected persons.
From a lifetime perspective, it is estimated that, compared 
with no vaccination, approximately 122 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 116–129) cases and 23 (CI = 18–29) deaths 
could be prevented, and 385 (CI = 230–458) quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) could be saved, at a mean cost per QALY of 
$732,000 (CI = $337,000–$1,218,000) with a meningococcal 
conjugate vaccination program that includes a primary vaccina-
tion series followed by lifelong booster doses until age 70 years, 
targeting all currently HIV-infected persons aged ≥2 months 
in the United States (CDC, unpublished data, 2016).†
Recommendations
HIV-infected persons aged ≥2 months should routinely 
receive meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Table 3). HIV- 
infected children aged <2 years should receive the vaccine 
in accordance with the age-appropriate, licensed, multidose 
schedule (1,10). Persons aged ≥2 years with HIV infection 
who have not been previously vaccinated should receive a 
2-dose primary series of MenACWY conjugate vaccine. Persons 
aged ≥2 years with HIV infection who have been previously

vaccinated with 1 dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine 
should receive a booster dose at the earliest opportunity, pro-
vided at least 8 weeks have elapsed since the previous dose, and 
then continue to receive boosters at the appropriate interval 
throughout life.§ The recommendations for children aged 
2 months through 2 years and persons aged ≥25 years are based 
on expert opinion; the vaccine was not studied in HIV-infected 
persons in these age groups. On the basis of available data and 
expert opinion, either MenACWY-CRM or MenACWY-D 
may be used in HIV-infected persons.
The same vaccine product should be used for all doses. 
However, if the product used for previous doses is unknown 
or unavailable, the vaccination series may be completed 
with any age- and formulation-appropriate meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine. Although no data on interchangeability 
of meningococcal conjugate vaccines in HIV-infected per-
sons are available, limited data from a postlicensure study in 
healthy adolescents suggests safety and immunogenicity of 
MenACWY-CRM are not adversely affected by prior immu-
nization with MenACWY-D (1,11).
ACIP recommends that HIV-infected infants aged 
2 through 23 months receive MenACWY-CRM. HIV-infected 
children should not receive MenACWY-D before age 2 years, 
similar to the recommendation for children with functional 
or anatomic asplenia. Previously, children with functional or 
anatomic asplenia were recommended to receive 13-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) according to the 
normal schedule but to delay MenACWY-D vaccination until 
age 2 years because of immune interference (1,12). Because 
MenACWY-CRM does not demonstrate immune interference 
with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) after 
the 12-month dose (13–15), MenACWY-CRM can be admin-
istered concomitantly with PCV13.
In addition, new data suggest the potential for immunologic 
interference in the meningococcal human complement serum 
bactericidal assay (hSBA) responses when MenACWY-D is 
administered 30 days after Daptacel (diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine [DTaP], Sanofi Pasteur) 
(16). In one study among children aged 4 through 6 years, the 
hSBA responses to all four meningococcal serogroups failed to 
meet noninferiority criteria when MenACWY-D was adminis-
tered 30 days after Daptacel. In contrast, co-administration of 
MenACWY-D and Daptacel was not associated with reduced 
hSBA responses to all four meningococcal serogroups. The 
study objectives did not include evaluation of the potential for 
interference that other DTaP containing vaccines might have 
on meningococcal seroresponse rates (16). If MenACWY-D 
is to be administered to a child at increased risk for meningo-
coccal disease, including children who are HIV-infected, it is 
recommended that MenACWY-D be given either before or 
concomitantly with DTaP
.
MenACWY is recommended for HIV-infected persons aged 
≥56 years because of the need for revaccination (i.e., booster 
doses). Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4, 
Menomune, Sanofi Pasteur) is the only licensed meningococcal 
vaccine for adults aged ≥56 years; however, no data are available 
on use of MPSV4 in HIV-infected adults. For healthy adults 
who have received MenACWY previously, limited data dem-
onstrate a higher antibody response after a subsequent dose of 
MenACWY compared with a subsequent dose of MPSV4 (1).
To date, no randomized, controlled clinical trials have been 
conducted to evaluate use of MenACWY vaccines in pregnant 
or lactating women. Pregnancy should not preclude indicated 
vaccination with MenACWY.

Precautions and Contraindications
Before administering meningococcal conjugate vaccines, 
health care providers should consult the package insert for 
precautions, warnings, and contraindications (13,16). Adverse 
events occurring after administration of any vaccine should 
be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System 
(VAERS). Reports can be submitted to VAERS online, by fax, 
or by mail. Additional information about VAERS is available by 
telephone (1-800-822-7967) or online (https://vaers.hhs.gov).

Summary
What is currently recommended?
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
currently recommends routine vaccination with meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine for all adolescents and for certain groups of 
persons at increased risk for meningococcal disease: persons 
who have persistent complement component deficiencies; 
persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia; microbiolo-
gists who routinely are exposed to isolates of Neisseria menin-
gitidis; persons identified to be at increased risk because of a 
meningococcal disease outbreak attributable to serogroup A, C, 
W, or Y; military recruits; first-year college students living in 
residence halls; and persons who travel to or reside in areas in 
which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic. In 
addition, ACIP recommends routine vaccination with 
serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccine for persons who 
have persistent complement component deficiencies; persons 
who have anatomic or functional asplenia; microbiologists who 
routinely are exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis; and persons 
identified to be at increased risk because of a serogroup B 
meningococcal disease outbreak.
Why are the recommendations being modified now?
A growing body of evidence supports an increased risk for 
meningococcal disease in human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)–infected persons. The evidence supporting the use of 
meningococcal conjugate vaccines in HIV-infected persons was 
evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.
What are the new recommendations?
All HIV-infected persons aged ≥2 months should routinely 
receive meningococcal conjugate vaccine; children aged 
<2 years should be vaccinated using a multidose schedule. 
Persons aged ≥2 years with HIV who have not been previously 
vaccinated should receive a 2-dose primary series of meningo-
coccal conjugate vaccine. Persons with HIV who have been 
previously vaccinated with meningococcal conjugate vaccine 
should receive a booster dose at the earliest opportunity (at 
least 8 weeks after the previous dose) and then continue to 
receive boosters at the appropriate intervals. If the most recent 
dose was received before age 7 years, a booster dose should be 
administered 3 years later. If the most recent dose was received 
at age ≥7 years, a booster should be administered 5 years later 
and every 5 years thereafter throughout life.
