Abstract
Background:
Although
several
public
health
organizations
have
recommended
population-wide reduction in salt intake, the evidence on the population benefits remains
unclear. We conducted a metaknowledge analysis of the literature on salt intake and
health outcomes.
Methods: We identified reports—primary studies, systematic reviews, guidelines and
comments, letters or reviews—addressing the effect of sodium intake on cerebro-
cardiovascular disease or mortality. We classified reports as supportive or contradictory
of the hypothesis that salt reduction leads to population benefits, and constructed a net-
work of citations connecting these reports. We tested for citation bias using an exponen-
tial random graph model. We also assessed the inclusion of primary studies in
systematic reviews on the topic.
Results: We identified 269 reports (25% primary studies, 5% systematic reviews, 4%
guidelines and 66% comments, letters, or reviews) from between 1978 and 2014. Of
these, 54% were supportive of the hypothesis, 33% were contradictory and 13% were in-
conclusive. Reports were 1.51 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38 to 1.65] times more likely
to cite reports that drew a similar conclusion, than to cite reports drawing a different con-
clusion. In all, 48 primary studies were selected for inclusion across 10 systematic re-
views. If any given primary study was selected by a review, the probability that a further
review would also have selected it was 27.0% (95% CI 20.3% to 33.7%).
Conclusions: We documented a strong polarization of scientific reports on the link be-
tween sodium intake and health outcomes, and a pattern of uncertainty in systematic re-
views about what should count as evidence.
Key words: Sodium chloride (dietary), bias (epidemiology), bibliometric analysis, review literature as topic

 Background
Universal salt reduction has been the subject of consider-
able
scientific
controversy
over
several
decades.1,2
Proponents of population-wide reduction in salt consump-
tion note that high sodium intakes increase blood pressure
and thus the risk of cerebro-cardiovascular events, and as-
sert that salt reduction policies will produce major public
health benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO)
recommends reducing sodium intake to < 2 g/day in
adults.3 Opponents of population-based salt reduction
argue that the relationship between sodium intake and
clinical outcomes is U- or J-shaped and that the harms
associated with low sodium intakes may mitigate any po-
tential benefits of blood pressure reductions arising from
decreased salt intakes.4,5 In a recent report, the United
States Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of
Science concluded that there is a lack of evidence for bene-
fits of reducing sodium intake to the very low levels recom-
mended by the WHO.6
In many respects, the divide between the uncertainty in
the scientific literature about the potential benefits of salt
reduction in populations and the certitude expressed by de-
cision makers involved in developing public health policies
in this arena is jarring.1,7 Whereas several authors involved
in the conduct of systematic reviews of the evidence on so-
dium have argued that the salt hypothesis is a distraction
with little empirical grounding,8 others have asserted that
salt reduction in populations should be a central public
health priority in the 21st century.9 Assuming that all par-
ties involved have the best interests of science and public
health in mind, this controversy raises questions about the
production of knowledge in population health science and
how that production influences public health practice.10
Toward the end of contributing to population health
epistemology, we examined the patterns of knowledge gen-
eration surrounding this controversy. First, we used net-
work analysis to assess the patterns of citations among
reports pertaining to the effect of population-level sodium
intake on cerebro-cardiovascular disease or all-cause mor-
tality. Second, we assessed the agreement in primary study
selection between relevant systematic reviews. By tracking
the networks of citations between reports and among
researchers co-authoring reports, we aimed to better
understand how this controversy has been sustained and to
expose beliefs or preferences that shape knowledge produc-
tion underlying this scientific literature.11
Methods
Selection of reports
We systematically reviewed the literature to include all: (i)
reports of primary studies; (ii) systematic reviews; (iii) clin-
ical practice guidelines or consensus statements; and (iv)
comments, letters or narrative reviews. We considered as
eligible all reports that addressed the effect of sodium
intake, or interventions targeting sodium intake, on cere-
bro-cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality. Eligible
primary studies were randomized trials, cohort studies and
case-control studies. Simulation modelling efforts, cost-
effectiveness studies and ecological analyses were deemed
ineligible.
The last search was conducted in September 2014. We
searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects,
the
WHO
Institutional
Repository
for
Information
Sharing, the US National Guideline Clearinghouse, the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the
American
Heart
Association
and
American
Stroke
Association statements and guidelines, and the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans. We identified primary studies
by screening the lists of studies included in the selected sys-
tematic reviews. In addition, we screened the reference lists
of all reports. For a detailed description of the selection cri-
teria and search strategies, see Web Text 1 (available as
Supplementary data at IJE online).
Classification of reports
Two authors (L.T., S.G.) classified each report into one of
three categories: supportive of the hypothesis that popula-
tion-wide reduction of sodium intake results in reduction
in cerebro-cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality;
contradictory of this hypothesis; or inconclusive. Our
Key Messages
• We documented a strong polarization of scientific reports on the link between sodium intake and health outcomes.
• A majority of the existing papers are supportive of the salt hypothesis but a substantial minority are not.
• Published reports supporting either side of the hypothesis are less likely to cite contradictory papers.
• There was very little consistency in the selection of primary studies in systematic reviews on the topic.

 primary assessment was based on the conclusion reported
in the abstract of the selected reports. If there was no ab-
stract or summary statement about the effect of sodium in-
take or of interventions targeting sodium intake on
cerebro-cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortality, our
assessment was based on a review of statements in the full-
text report.
Citation network analysis
First, we constructed the network of citations connecting
the reports. We identified the citations between the se-
lected reports by using the Web of Science database and by
manually screening all selected articles. We counted mul-
tiple citations from an article to another as one citation.
We constructed a directed acyclic graph in which each
node was a report and edges were directed from a citing re-
port to a cited report. We distinguished multiple publica-
tions of the same report (whether there was a clear
statement that republishing was intentional or not).
Second, we used an exponential random graph (ERG)
model to explain the probability of a citation link between
two reports, based on publication year, type of report (i.e.
primary study, systematic review, guideline and comment,
letter or review), journal impact factor and network struc-
ture.12,13 The model was used to formally test for homo-
phily
according
to
report
classification
(supportive,
contradictory, inconclusive): our hypothesis was that a re-
port would be more likely to cite another report that drew
the same conclusion (supportive, contradictory or incon-
clusive). The interpretation of the results of an ERG model
is similar to that of a logistic regression model and we ex-
pressed results in terms of odds ratios.
Third, we identified the most influential reports in the
citation network by using a random walk approach (see
Supplementary data, available at IJE online).14 We as-
sessed the likelihood that a supportive, contradictory or in-
conclusive report was among the most influential reports.
Co-authorship network analysis
We identified the authors of each report. First, we pro-
duced Lorenz curves showing the cumulative fraction of
supportive, contradictory and inconclusive reports against
the cumulative fraction of authors. In this analysis, we div-
ided up the authorship credit for a report among all au-
thors (e.g. each author on a three-author report was
credited with a third of an authorship).
Second, we constructed an undirected network graph in
which each node was an author and edges connected two
authors who co-signed at least one report. Node size was
proportional to the number of reports written by the
author and edge width was proportional to the number of
reports co-signed by the two authors.
Third, based on the classification of reports, we classi-
fied each author into three groups of positions, i.e. as being
supportive, contradictory or inconclusive. We assessed the
degree to which authors who co-signed at least two reports
had similar positions. We estimated an homophily index as
the number of co-authorships external to the groups minus
the number of co-authorships internal to the groups div-
ided by the total number of co-authorships.15 The index
ranges from �1 (homophily) to þ 1 (heterophily).
Agreement in primary study selection between
systematic reviews
We assessed the agreement between systematic reviews as
to which primary studies they included. We assessed which
outcomes, which populations and which study designs
were used in each study. We estimated the overall prob-
ability that, if a primary study was selected in a systematic
review, another review would also select it.16 Finally, we
estimated the likelihood that a systematic review included
a supportive, contradictory or inconclusive study, respect-
ively. In this analysis, we considered multiple publications
of the same report as unique.
Results
Characteristics of reports
We selected 269 distinct reports (Web Figure 1, available
as Supplementary data at IJE online). Among these, 68 re-
ported the results of 60 primary studies, 14 reported the re-
sults of 10 systematic reviews, 11 reported the conclusions
of 9 clinical practice guidelines and 176 were comments,
letters or narrative reviews (Table 1). A total of 148 (55%)
reports were published in 2011 or after. In all: 146 (54%)
of the reports were supportive of the hypothesis that popu-
lation-wide reduction of sodium intake is associated with
reduced cerebro-cardiovascular disease or all-cause mortal-
ity; 88 (33%) were contradictory of this hypothesis; and
35 (13%) were inconclusive.
Citation network analysis
Figure 1 shows the complex citation network correspond-
ing to 2156 citations between the 269 reports, with 821.1
million citation paths supporting it. Half of the reports
were cited 2 times or less whereas 10% of the reports were
cited 25 times or more. Primary studies on average received
22 citations, systematic reviews 19 citations, guidelines 14
citations, and comments, letters, or reviews 4 citations.

 The distribution of citations received was similar between
the three categories of reports (supportive, contradictory
or
inconclusive)
(Web
Figure
2,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online). However, according to
a multivariate exponential random graph model, reports
were 1.51 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.65, P < 10–4) times more
likely to cite a report that drew a similar conclusion (sup-
portive, contradictory or inconclusive), all other variables
held constant (Table 2). Lastly, we identified 12 influential
reports (Web Figure 3, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online). Ten reported the results of primary studies and
two of systematic reviews. There was not sufficient
evidence for an association between report conclusions
and the likelihood of being influential (3%, 7% and 6% in
supportive, contradictory and inconclusive reports, re-
spectively, exact P-value ¼ 0.23).
Co-authorship network analysis
We identified 643 distinct authors with a median of 3 au-
thors per report. The production of reports was unbal-
anced: 25% and 28% of authors produced 75% of
contradictory and supportive reports but 41% of authors
produced 75% of inconclusive reports (Figure 2). We

cited report. Node shape indicates the type of report and node colour corresponds to the report classification (supportive, contradictory, inconclu-
sive). Node size is proportional to journal impact factors. Any given report cannot cite a later report but only an earlier or concurrent report, thus there
are no loops from a node back to itself. We organized the network into a depth partition of 25 hierarchical levels reflecting the emergent appearance
of reports in citation paths. The top level corresponds to most recent reports that have not been cited yet. The deeper levels correspond to older re-
ports. Sink nodes correspond to seed papers (i.e. the first to address the link between sodium intake and health outcomes). An exponential random
graph model analysis showed that reports were 1.51 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.65, P < 10–4) times more likely to cite a report that drew a similar conclusion
(supportive, contradictory, or inconclusive).

contradictory and supportive reports but 41% of authors produced 75% of inconclusive reports, suggesting that few authors making strong argu-
ments either supportive or contradictory of the salt hypothesis dominate the field, whereas authors whose findings are inconclusive appear more
heterogeneous.

 classified 337 authors as being supportive, 178 as being
contradictory and 128 as being inconclusive. The network
of co-authorship showed a strong clustering, with few col-
laborations between authors holding different positions
(homophily index –0.67) (Figure 3).
Agreement in primary study selection between
systematic reviews
Overall, the 10 systematic reviews included a total of 48
different primary studies (Figure 4). We identified six po-
tentially eligible studies that were included in none of the
systematic reviews and seven additional primary studies
that were published after the date of last search of the most
recent systematic review. There was poor agreement in pri-
mary study selection between the 10 systematic reviews
(Web Figure 4A, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online). The estimated probability that, if a study was se-
lected by a review, a further review would also have se-
lected it was 27.0% (95% CI 20.3% to 33.7%). The 48
selected studies had a wide range of study designs: 52%
were cohort studies and 27% were randomized trials. Of
note, the estimated probability that, if a randomized trial
was selected by a review, a further review would also have
selected it was 15.0% (95% CI 7.2% to 22.9%). The stud-
ies included different populations: 35% were conducted in
general population and 17% in heart failure population
(Web Figure 4B, C). Across the 54 potentially eligible stud-
ies, the impact of sodium intake on all-cause mortality was
reported in 33 (61%) studies, on cardiovascular mortality
in 15 (28%), on cardiovascular diseases in 25 (46%) and
on stroke in 21 (39%) (Web Figure 4D). In all, the average
likelihood that a systematic review included a primary
study was lower for primary studies that reached a contra-
dictory rather than a supportive conclusion (22.6%,
30.7% and 25.5% for contradictory, supportive and in-
conclusive
reports,
respectively,
P ¼ 0.18)
(Figure
4).
Among the 10 systematic reviews, 4 reached a supportive
conclusion, 3 reached a contradictory conclusion and 3
were inconclusive. On average, supportive systematic re-
views were more likely to select supportive primary studies
than
other
reviews
(43.7%
vs
23.0%,
P < 0.001),

Discussion
Based on a systematic review of the literature, we docu-
mented a strong polarization of scientific reports on the
link between sodium intake and clinical outcomes in popu-
lations, and a pattern of uncertainty in published system-
atic reviews. We found, first, that a majority of existing
reports were supportive of the hypothesis but that a sub-
stantial minority were not. Second, we found substantial
citation bias, where published reports preferentially cited
previous reports that reached a similar conclusion. Third,
the literature in the field was dominated by a few reports
and by a few prolific authors, who each hold and repeat
particular positions. Fourth, there was very little consist-
ency in the selection of primary studies in systematic re-
views, further compounding the challenges the field faces
in achieving resolution.
Uncertainty is an important motivator of scientific
work. However, it also tends to stifle action, particularly
in fields such as public health where practitioners fre-
quently are confronted by problems for which there is little
relevant research evidence. The mandates of public health
require decision makers to act in the absence of certitude in
many, if not most, cases. Given the prominence of popula-
tion-wide salt reduction as a cornerstone of global health
policies to curb cardiovascular disease mortality, the case
of salt reduction represents a particularly important ex-
ample for examining how evidence and uncertainty in-
form, or do not inform, public health practice. Several
modelling studies have concluded that the effects of reduc-
ing dietary salt intake on cardiovascular disease mortality,
as mediated through blood pressure, would be consider-
able.17–19 However, we found that the published literature
bears little imprint of an ongoing controversy, but rather
contains two almost distinct and disparate lines of scholar-
ship, one supporting and one contradicting the hypothesis
that salt reduction in populations will improve clinical
outcomes.
We first mapped the salt controversy by connecting re-
ports, through a citation network, in a dialogue of
Figure 4. Patterns of primary study selection in 10 systematic reviews. The stair step graphs show the cumulative numbers of primary studies
(randomized trials, cohort studies and case-control studies), according to their publication dates. The dotted vertical lines show the systematic re-
views, according to the date of last search for primary studies. The squares show the numbers of primary studies selected in each review. For in-
stance, Hooper et al. performed the last search in July 2000 and selected 5 primary studies out of 16 potentially eligible. Across the period, the
evidence covered by systematic reviews was consistently incomplete: the systematic reviews included from 12% to 48% of primary studies eligible
for inclusion. When stratifying by report classification (supportive, contradictory, inconclusive), the average likelihood that a systematic review
included a primary study was lower for primary studies that reached a contradictory rather than a supportive conclusion (23%, 31% and 26% for
contradictory, supportive and inconclusive reports, respectively, P ¼ 0.18).

 supportive, contradictory and inconclusive statements. We
found evidence of homophily on citation patterns, where
authors who had a pro or con point of view were 50%
more likely to cite papers with their point of view than the
other point of view. We also mapped the controversy by
re-attaching the statements to their authors and found
marked clustering in existing networks of scientists. We in-
terpret these finding as reflecting the sustained divide be-
tween opposing groups of scientists who differ in their
interpretation of the data about whether population-wide
salt reduction will improve population health. Part of the
observed pattern may be explained by direct as well as co-
author and collaborative self-citations.24 The data are con-
sistent with a picture where a few authors and a few key
papers dominate the literature. These authors and publica-
tions make strong arguments either supportive or contra-
dictory of the salt hypothesis. Those scientific voices whose
findings are inconclusive appear more heterogeneous and
are situated mainly on the outskirts of the dispute.
Previous studies have shown how citation practices can
be biased towards positive, statistically significant findings
or distorted by the amplification or avoidance of evi-
dence.20–23,25–27 Several authors have also discussed the se-
lective citation of studies that support a given hypothesis
or idea (viewpoint citation or unbalanced citation).10,28–30
To our knowledge, our analytical approach is novel as it
allows an empirical quantification of such polarization.
Our application around the debate about reducing salt in-
take echoes other scientific controversies, such as the dis-
pute around electronic cigarettes. It could be applicable to
different areas of scientific controversy, and our analysis is
intended to encourage such empirical investigations; it
would be interesting to compare patterns of polarization
for other controversial or, conversely, strongly consensual
topics.
The citation bias we found was paralleled by consider-
able variation in the inclusion of primary evidence in sys-
tematic reviews addressing the effect of sodium intake on
cardiovascular outcomes. We found that if a primary study
was selected by a review, the chance that another review
would also have selected it was less than a third; this prob-
ability was lower for randomized trials. This is a level of
disagreement that goes beyond differences in selection cri-
teria across reviews. This finding reflects ongoing uncer-
tainty and disagreement about what should count as
evidence. Some have previously questioned the role of
randomized trials as the source of definitive evidence, and
a recent review of the methodological quality of observa-
tional studies relating sodium to cardiovascular outcomes
found that methodological defects, considered to have the
potential to alter the direction of association, affected all
26 observational studies (except for one which showed a
null association).31 Systematic reviews have the potential
to provide the highest level of evidence. However, meta-
analysts must cast a dispassionate eye over the literature.
In our analysis, we found that the variation in the inclusion
of primary evidence directly influenced the conclusions of
systematic reviews and that the inclusion or exclusion of
specific studies shaped the secondary evidence. This vari-
ation threatens the validity of the syntheses and reinforces
existing uncertainty about the science that sustains the dis-
pute. These findings have implications for the translation
of conflicting, uncertain evidence into public health pol-
icy.7,32,33 Both the misuse of uncertainty and the exagger-
ation of certainty can shape the outcomes of public health
decision-making processes.
Although science has been acutely alert to potential fi-
nancial conflicts of interest in recent decades2,34–36 much
less attention has been paid to other potential conflicts—
particularly biases that are embedded in long-held beliefs
that resist re-examination when new data become avail-
able.37 It has previously been suggested that these conflicts
of interest may be more powerful than financial consider-
ation.30,38 Our findings support a strong bias towards the
status quo and the absence of a genuine scientific conversa-
tion where each side engages the other. The citation pat-
terns underlying this particular debate suggest that the
scientific community is not engaged in a collaborative ef-
fort to arrive at a data-informed consensus on the matter
and instead appears to be divided into two silos. This pat-
tern is worrisome when one considers how such a division
may be perpetuated as future generations of researchers
are brought up in one or another ‘tradition’, rendering the
gap between the two ‘sides’ of the argument ever more dif-
ficult to bridge. In recognition of this problem, at least in
the abstract, Osborne et al. proposed to give a central place
to collaborative argumentation in the scientific educational
process, to help students learn to argue based on available
evidence and develop insight into how and why we know
what we know.39 Such an approach might contribute to
greater clarity around difficult problems such as salt con-
sumption and public health if a commitment to collabora-
tive argumentation in science can be made.
Our analyses have limitations. First, we may have been
missed some relevant reports, despite our search of a range
of databases. In particular, we searched comments, letters
and narrative reviews in MEDLINE only. We did not con-
sider material from conferences, although some conference
proceedings appeared in abstracts that we selected. In fact,
we manually screened the reference lists of all reports.
Consequently, it is unlikely that a relevant report, if cited,
was left out of our claim-specific citation network. Second,
our classification of reports as supportive, contradictory or
inconclusive was based on conclusions that others may

 interpret differently. However, we used explicit criteria for
classification that was performed in duplicate by independ-
ent reviewers. As a consequence, the classification process
was burdensome; natural language processing methods, es-
pecially supervised machine learning classification, may be
used to reduce the amount of human review required to as-
sess each article, so that the analysis method could be
applied to a wider array of topics.40,41 Third, citation does
not mean endorsement and we did not assess if the cited re-
ports were qualified either positively or negatively by the cit-
ing reports. The claim-specific citation network may be
affected by other biases. For example, reports may have cited
previous content in order to criticize its validity or reframe
its meaning to divert its implications.42 Last but not least,
we do not here intend to ‘take sides’ in the salt debate: we
neither endorse nor oppose the central hypothesis at hand.
Our intention in this article was not to be part of the debate,
and our findings should not be used to fuel it. Instead we
aimed to better understand the production of scholarship
underlying the controversy and, on the basis of a systematic
review and quantitative analyses, to try to lay bare and begin
to unravel the challenges underlying the dispute.

Sodium intake in most Western countries is a mean of about
4g/day (equivalent to 10g salt/day) with regional variations
in mean intake.1 Lowering sodium intake to < 2.0–2.4 g/day
in the entire population is recommended by some, but not all,
guidelines.2,3 The World Health Organization (WHO) rec-
ommends a 30% reduction in salt intake in all adult popula-
tions, with a target sodium intake of < 2g/day (5g/day
salt).3 These recommendations do not take into account the
marked variations in the mean intakes between populations
and that within each population there are also variations.
The controversy about sodium intake arises from the discon-
nection between objective evaluation of the evidence and the
pressures to advocate for public health interventions, even
when key data are lacking.4 It also stems from differences in
