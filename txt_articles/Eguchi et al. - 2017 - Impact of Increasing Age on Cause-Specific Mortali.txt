Purpose
To perform competing risks analysis and determine short- and long-term cancer- and noncancer-
specific mortality and morbidity in patients who had undergone resection for stage I non–small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC).
Patients and Methods
Of 5,371 consecutive patients who had undergone curative-intent resection of primary lung cancer
at our institution (2000 to 2011), 2,186 with pathologic stage I NSCLC were included in the analysis.
All preoperative clinical variables known to affect outcomes were included in the analysis, spe-
cifically, Charlson comorbidity index, predicted postoperative (ppo) diffusing capacity of the lung for
carbon monoxide, and ppo forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Cause-specific mortality analysis
was performed with competing risks analysis.
Results
Of 2,186 patients, 1,532 (70.1%) were $ 65 years of age, including 638 (29.2%) $ 75 years of age. In
patients , 65, 65 to 74, and $ 75 years of age, 5-year lung cancer–specific cumulative incidence of
death (CID) was 7.5%, 10.7%, and 13.2%, respectively (overall, 10.4%); noncancer-specific CID
was 1.8%, 4.9%, and 9.0%, respectively (overall, 5.3%). In patients $ 65 years of age, for up to 2.5
years after resection, noncancer-specific CID was higher than lung cancer–specific CID; the higher
noncancer-specific, early-phase mortality was enhanced in patients $ 75 years of age than in those
65 to 74 years of age. Multivariable analysis showed that low ppo diffusing capacity of lung for
carbon monoxide was an independent predictor of severe morbidity (P , .001), 1-year mortality
(P , .001), and noncancer-specific mortality (P , .001), whereas low ppo forced expiratory volume in
1 second was an independent predictor of lung cancer–specific mortality (P = .002).
Conclusion
In patients who undergo curative-intent resection of stage I NSCLC, noncancer-specific mortality is
a significant competing event, with an increasing impact as patient age increases.

INTRODUCTION
Among solid tumors, lung cancer carries a rela-
tively high risk of competing cancer and non-
cancer events because more than two thirds of
patients with lung cancer are $ 65 years of age at
the time of diagnosis,1 and one half of those
patients are $ 75 years of age with associated high
comorbidities.2 As age increases, the risk of
competing events increases, such as death from
noncancer diseases.3 In this era of personalized
cancer therapy, important to the stratification of
individualized treatments is the determination of
how both cancer and noncancer risk factors—
specifically, comorbidities associated with in-
creasing age—contribute to the risk of death.
After the publication of the National Lung
Screening Trial results, which demonstrated the
efficacy of low-dose computed tomography
screening for lung cancer, detection of early-stage
lung cancer, for which curative-intent resection
is the standard treatment,4 is expected to in-
crease.5-7 The data from the International As-
sociation for the Study of Lung Cancer, which
were derived from a multinational cohort, are

 considered the reference standard for overall survival (OS) in
patients with non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). According to
these data, the estimated 5-year overall mortality from stage IA and
IB NSCLC is 17% and 29%, respectively, after curative-intent R0
resection.8 Smoking status, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) history, and pulmonary function have been reported to be
predictive of OS or lung cancer–related survival after resection of
NSCLC.9-20 Noncancer risk factors, such as Charlson comorbidity
index (CCI), cardiovascular disease (CVD) history, body mass
index, and serum creatinine level, have been reported to influence
outcomes.18,21-23 However, a comprehensive analysis of all vari-
ables known to affect outcomes has not been published and, to our
knowledge, no study has included a cause-specific analysis with an
evaluation of competing risks. The goal of this study, therefore, was
to perform a competing risks analysis to determine short- and
long-term cancer- and noncancer-specific mortality and morbidity
in patients who had undergone resection for stage I NSCLC.
By using a large, uniform cohort of patients with stage I NSCLC,
we analyzed short- and long-term cause-specific outcomes through
competing risks analysis. This comprehensive prognostic analysis
included all preoperative variables known to contribute individually
to outcomes, including lung-related (forced expiratory volume in
1 second [FEV1]; diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide
[DLCO]); age-related (cardiorespiratory comorbidities, renal func-
tion, CCI); and cancer-related (tumor size on computed tomography
scan) parameters. In light of the ongoing debate about the appro-
priate type of surgical resection for small NSCLC—lobectomy ver-
sus sublobar resection (wedge resection or segmentectomy)—the
identification of predictive factors for cancer- and noncancer-specific
morbidity and mortality will be of substantial value for stratifying
therapy.24,25 The establishment of such factors is even more im-
portant for older patients, who comprise the majority of patients with
stage I NSCLC.
Our investigation yielded novel and previously unreported
observations on outcomes in patients who undergo resection of
stage I NSCLC: Noncancer-specific mortality is a prominent
competing event, with an increasing impact as age increases;
noncancer-specific mortality is higher than lung cancer–specific
mortality for up to 1.5 years after resection, particularly in older
patients ($ 65 years of age); and low predicted postoperative (ppo)
DLCO is an independent predictor of noncancer-specific mortality,
whereas low ppo FEV1 is an independent predictor of lung
cancer–specific mortality.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Cohort
This retrospective study (WA0269-08, WA0219-09, and WA0280-12)
was approved by the institutional review board at Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center. Medical records of 5,371 patients with primary lung cancer
who had undergone lung resection at our center between 2000 and 2011
were reviewed. Patient exclusion criteria; preoperative, surgical, pathologic
data variables; and the surveillance protocol are provided in detail in the Data
Supplement. A total of 2,186 patients were included in the study (Fig 1).
End Points and Cause of Death
The end points of this study were severe morbidity, 1-year mor-
tality, lung cancer–specific mortality, noncancer-specific mortality, and
OS. Severe morbidities were defined as grade 3 and higher, occurring
within 30 days after surgery, in accordance with Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03).26 The classification of severe
morbidities and corresponding incidence rates are shown in the Data
Supplement.
The cause of death was classified as lung cancer specific, noncancer
specific, other cancer specific, or unknown. Lung cancer–specific mortality
was defined as death as a result of recurrent disease associated with resected
lung cancer. Patients who had progressive recurrent disease at the last
follow-up and death without a documented specific reason were included
in the lung cancer–specific group. Noncancer-specific mortality was de-
fined as death as a result of specific causes other than malignant disease,
including death without a documented specific reason within 6 months of
the last follow-up in the absence of lung cancer recurrence or progressive
malignant disease. Death as a result of second primary lung cancer or other
malignancies was regarded as other cancer specific.
Statistical Analyses
Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized
with descriptive statistics. Associations between variables were analyzed
with Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum test
for continuous variables by age-group (, 65, 65 to 74, $ 75 years) and
surgical procedure (lobectomy v sublobar resection).
To evaluate age-related changes in preoperative variables (cardio-
pulmonary function and CCI), patients were divided into the seven in-
creasing age-groups (# 55, 56 to 60, 61 to 65, 66 to 70, 71 to 75, 76 to 80,
. 80 years) that were explored graphically. The mean for each variable of
the seven groups was summarized and fitted by using cubic B-splines for
graphical representation.27 Differences in age-related change between the
lobectomy and sublobar resection groups were evaluated by multivariable
logistic regression for COPD and CVD history and linear regression for
continuous variables. Model covariates included surgical procedure,

 continuous age, and interaction of both, where applicable. A significant
interaction indicates that the pattern of age-related change is significantly
different between surgical procedures.
Univariable and multivariable logistic models were constructed to
identify factors associated with severe morbidity and 1-year mortality. We
elected to use ppo FEV1 and ppo DLCO instead of FEV1 and DLCO in our
regression models because risk of postoperative morbidity has been linked
to ppo lung function.11,28
The associations between factors and the risk of each cause of death
were evaluated with competing risks analysis. Patients were censored if
they were alive at the time of the last follow-up. Cumulative incidence
functions for each competing event were calculated by competing risks
methodology.29 Without loss of generality, analyses of the cumulative
incidence of lung cancer–specific mortality considered noncancer-
specific and all-other-cause mortality as two separate competing risks,
and Fine and Gray’s30 competing risks regressions were used to estimate
the subhazard ratio to evaluate the association between preoperative
variables and risk of each cause of death. Multivariable regression models
included all variables with P , .1 on univariable analysis. Competing
risks analyses were conducted with the R project’s Subdistribution
Analysis of Competing Risks (cmprsk) package (version 2.13.1) and the
Stata 13 Competing Risks Regressions (stcrreg) command (StataCorp,
College Station, TX). Estimation of 5-year cumulative incidence of
death (CID) by using ppo DLCO, ppo FEV1, and CCI was explored
graphically; the estimated 5-year CID by groups (ppo FEV1, # 50%,
51% to 60%, 61% to 70%, 71% to 80%, 81% to 90%, . 90%; ppo
DLCO, # 45%, 46% to 55%, 56% to 65%, 66% to 75%, 76% to
85%, . 85%; CCI, 0, 1, 2, 3, $ 4) was summarized and fitted by using
cubic B-splines for graphical representation. OS was estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups by log-rank test.
Hazard ratios were estimated from Cox univariable and multivariable
models. As a representation of the performance of multivariable
models in terms of discrimination, the concordance index (C-index)
was reported for logistic,31 survival,32 and competing risks models.33
Analysis for cumulative incidence of recurrence was performed (Data
Supplement). All statistical tests were two sided, and P , .05 was con-
sidered significant.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of the 2,186 patients evaluated, the majority were women
(59.1%), were former or current smokers (84.2%), had no
history of COPD (75.3%) or CVD (81.0%), had a CCI $ 1
(59.1%), were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma (79.8%), and
had stage IA disease (71.0%). Patient characteristics are listed in
Table 1.
Comparison by Age Groups and Surgical Procedures
Among the cohort, 1,532 (70.1%) of patients were $ 65 years
of age, including 638 (29.2%) $ 75 years of age. The majority
of patients underwent lobectomy (73.7%). All preoperative vari-
ables were statistically different among the three age-groups (, 65,
65 to 74, and $ 75 years). All preoperative variables, except sex and
smoking status, were statistically different between the lobectomy
and sublobar resection groups (Table 1).
The Data Supplement shows preoperative variables stratified
by surgical procedure for each age-group. Serum creatinine level,
COPD history, CVD history, and CCI increased as age increased; in
contrast, DLCO decreased as age increased. For most age-groups,
COPD history, CVD history, and CCI were higher in the sublobar
resection group than in the lobectomy group. In contrast, DLCO
and FEV1 were lower in the sublobar resection group than in the
lobectomy group.
Postoperative Severe Morbidities
Of the 2,186 patients evaluated, postoperative severe mor-
bidities developed in 167 (7.6%). Among them, 114 (68.3%) and
31 (18.6%) had respiratory and cardiovascular morbidities, re-
spectively. Overall severe morbidity and respiratory morbidity
were significantly more common in the lobectomy group than in
the sublobar resection group (P = .017 and .002, respectively) and
in patients who underwent right-side lower lobectomy (P = .025
and .029, respectively; Data Supplement).
Causes of Short- and Long-Term Mortality
The median follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 0.01 to 14.4
years). The 30-day, 90-day, 1-year, and 5-year mortality rates were
0.7% (n = 15), 1.2% (n = 27), 4.1% (n = 90), and 19.9% (n = 436),
respectively. Cardiorespiratory disease was the most frequent
specific cause of death at 30 and 90 days. At 1 year, the leading cause
of death was noncancer specific (45 of 90 [50.0%]) followed by
lung cancer specific (25 of 90 [27.8%]) and other cancer specific
(12 of 90 [13.3%]). At 5 years, the leading cause of death was lung
cancer specific (181 of 436 [41.5%]) followed by noncancer specific
(97 of 436 [22.2%]) and other cancer specific (63 of 436 [14.4%];
Table 2).
Univariable and Multivariable Analyses for Short- and
Long-Term Outcomes
Univariable analyses are outlined in the Data Supplement.
Multivariable analyses revealed the following independent pre-
dictors of each outcome: COPD history, lower ppo DLCO, higher
serum creatinine level, and lobectomy for severe morbidity
(C-index, 0.686); older age, male sex, lower ppo DLCO, larger
tumor size, and sublobar resection for 1-year mortality (C-index,
0.771); former and current smoker, lower ppo FEV1, larger tumor
size, and sublobar resection for lung cancer–specific mortality
(C-index, 0.668); older age, male sex, CVD history, lower ppo

(C-index, 0.769); and older age, male sex, current smoker, higher
CCI, lower ppo FEV1, lower ppo DLCO, larger tumor size, and
sublobar resection for OS (C-index, 0.709; Table 3).
Longitudinal Patterns of Lung Cancer–Specific and
Noncancer-Specific CID by Age Group
Lung cancer–specific and noncancer-specific CID curves are
shown in Fig 2. In patients , 65, 65 to 74, and $ 75 years of age,
5-year lung cancer–specific CID was 7.5%, 10.7%, and 13.2%,
respectively (overall, 10.4%), and noncancer-specific CID was 1.8%,
4.9%, and 9.0%, respectively (overall, 5.3%). Noncancer-specific CID
was higher than lung cancer–specific CID for up to 1.5 years after
resection. After 1.5 years, lung cancer–specific CID surpassed
noncancer-specific CID. The difference between curves in the early
phase after resectionwas enhanced in the cohortof patients $ 75 years
of age in which noncancer-specific mortality was higher until ap-
proximately 2.5 years postsurgery. In the cohort of patients 65 to
74 years of age, the shapes of both curves were similar to that for
the overall cohort. However, in the cohort of patients , 65 years of
age, the early-phase increase in noncancer-specific mortality was
not observed, and lung cancer–specific mortality was higher than
noncancer-specific mortality during most of the postoperative period.
Estimation of 5-Year Lung Cancer–Specific and
Noncancer-Specific CID by Using PPO FEV1, PPO
DLCO, and CCI
Figure 3A demonstrates that lung cancer–specific CID was the
highest (approximately 15%) with the lowest ppo FEV1 and that it
decreased linearly as ppo FEV1 increased. Noncancer-specific CID
plateaued when ppo FEV1 was $ 65% (61% to 70%) but increased
as ppo FEV1 decreased below that point. Figure 3B shows that lung
cancer–specific CID gradually decreased as ppo DLCO increased,
but the gradient was more gradual than it was for ppo FEV1. In
contrast, as ppo DLCO increased, noncancer-specific CID de-
creased linearly, from approximately 11% to 1%. Figure 3C
demonstrates
an
increase
of
noncancer-specific
and
lung
cancer–specific CID as CCI increased from 0 to 1; however, it
plateaued when CCI increased to . 1.
DISCUSSION
This study differentiates the influence of cancer-related and
noncancer-related risk factors by age-group and further identifies
factors that are predictive of short- and long-term cause-specific
mortality in patients with stage I NSCLC. We have shown that in

 patients with stage I NSCLC, the majority of postoperative severe
morbidity, 1-year mortality, and 5-year noncancer-specific mor-
tality were attributable to cardiorespiratory diseases. We have also
shown that short-term mortality is primarily attributable to
noncancer-specific diseases. More importantly, the higher in-
cidence of short-term noncancer-specific mortality was enhanced
in the older cohort ($ 75 years of age) and diminished in the
younger cohort (, 65 years of age), which underscores the clinical
significance of assessing noncancer-specific mortality as a com-
peting event in older patients (Data Supplement).
Multivariable analyses revealed that ppo DLCO was a strong
predictor of severe morbidity, 1-year mortality, and noncancer-
specific mortality. Low DLCO has been associated with obstruc-
tive,34 restrictive,35 and pulmonary vascular diseases36 as well as
with chronic heart failure.37 In previous studies, ppo DLCO
represents an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity
and operative mortality.11,13,38 Tumor size, ppo FEV1, and
smoking status were found to be independent predictors of lung
cancer–specific mortality. In addition, smoking-induced COPD
and associated CVD are linked to severe morbidity and CVD to
noncancer-specific death; CCI, which includes a history of cancer
(other than lung cancer), in addition to noncancer conditions,
predicts OS. Because the current study spans a long period, we
performed subanalyses of early (2000 to 2005) and later (2006 to
2011) cohorts. Conclusions were similar among all multivariable
models of outcomes (Data Supplement).
A review of the prior literature found 11 studies that investigated
the prognostic value of preoperative pulmonary function tests or
comorbidities in patients with resected NSCLC11,14,15,17-20,39-42; six of
these explored national databases14,15,17,39,40,42 (Data Supplement).
Only two studies included FEV1, DLCO, and comorbidities as
prognostic variables in the multivariable model.14,18 Of the two
studies that focused on stage I NSCLC,20,42 only one evaluated both
FEV1 and DLCO with OS as an end point.20 None of the studies
evaluated cause-specific mortality with competing risks analysis, and
only one study investigated both short- and long-term outcomes.40
The strengths of the current study include its comprehensive ex-
ploration of short- and long-term cause-specific outcomes, with
competing risks analysis, in a large, uniform cohort of patients with
stage I NSCLC; a multivariable analysis that included all preoperative
variables known to contribute individually to outcomes; and the
identification of independent predictors of each outcome, which
showed that ppo DLCO and comorbidities are predictors of
noncancer-specific mortality and postoperative morbidity and that
ppo FEV1 is a predictor of lung cancer–specific mortality.
The study cohort reasonably reflects that of the SEER data-
base, with the representation of patients 65 to 74 years of age
approximately 10% higher in our cohort and those . 84 years of
age 6% lower (Data Supplement). A possible explanation for these
differences is that the SEER database includes patients with
more–advanced stage cancer and/or patients treated with non-
surgical intervention. Because one third of patients with stage I

Cause-Specific Mortality and Morbidity in Stage I Lung Cancer
 NSCLC are $ 75 years of age at the time of diagnosis, the significant
competing risks outlined in the current study have broad implica-
tions for disease management in these patients. These observations
can inform conversations with patients and can be used when de-
ciding on aggressive treatments, particularly for high-risk patients.
For clinicians who manage patients with stage I NSCLC, the study
provides clinically applicable information on the time-related change
in mortality risk, including higher noncancer-specific mortality than
lung cancer–specific mortality in the early postoperative period; the
importance of predicting noncancer-specific mortality in older pa-
tients; an estimation of the 5-year CID for each cause-specific
mortality; and the importance of cardiorespiratory diseases for
postoperative severe morbidity and short-term mortality.
In this study, sublobar resection was associated with a lower
incidence of severe morbidity, particularly respiratory events, as
well as worse 1-year mortality, lung cancer–specific mortality,
noncancer-specific mortality, and OS. Previous studies reported an
association between sublobar resection and locoregional re-
currence,43-46 which suggests worse lung cancer–specific mortality.
Lower pulmonary function test and higher comorbidity status seen
in the sublobar resection group indicate selection bias on the basis
of cardiorespiratory condition and explains the worse noncancer-
specific outcomes (Data Supplement). These observations should
be taken into consideration during analysis in ongoing randomized
clinical trials (CALGB140503 and JCOG0802) in the assessment of
outcomes of sublobar versus lobar resection.
One limitation of this study is the number of patients with
an unknown cause of death. Of the 436 deaths within 5 years
of surgery, 95 were of unknown causes. Among these patients,
83 experienced no recurrence at the last visit (median follow-up,
0.8 years); the other 12 experienced recurrence but had stable
disease at the last visit (median follow-up, 1.6 years). Of these
95 patients, eight died within 1 year. These deaths may have af-
fected our results (Data Supplement). Another limitation is that we
did not evaluate patient family and/or social support, which may
have affected the analyses, especially that of the long-term, noncancer-
specific outcomes in elderly patients.
In conclusion, we have shown that compared with the
common approach of OS or event-free survival, cause-specific
outcome analysis better stratifies patients with stage I NSCLC
according to their risk of cancer mortality relative to noncancer
competing causes of death. Noncancer-specific mortality repre-
sents a significant competing event for lung cancer–specific mor-
tality, with an increasing impact as age increases. These findings can
provide patients with more accurate information on survivorship on
the basis of their individual preoperative status and help determine
patients’ optimal treatment options.

(A) Lung cancer–specific cumulative incidence of death (CID) is highest (approx-
imately 15%) at the lowest predicted postoperative (ppo) forced expiratory volume
in 1 second (FEV1) and decreases linearly as ppo FEV1 increases. Noncancer-
specific CID plateaus when ppo FEV1 is $ 65% (61%-70%) but increases pre-
cipitously as ppo FEV1 decreases below that point. (B) Lung cancer–specific CID
gradually decreases as ppo diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO)
increases, but the gradient is more gradual than that for ppo FEV1. By contrast,
noncancer-specific CID decreases linearly from approximately 11%-1% as ppo
DLCO increases. (C) Noncancer-specific and lung cancer–specific CID increase as
CCI increases from 0 to 1 but essentially plateaus when CCI increases to . 1.
