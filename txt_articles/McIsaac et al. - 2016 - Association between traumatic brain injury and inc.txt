T
raumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important public 
health concern: the estimated global lifetime preva-
lence is 3.49%.1–4 In Ontario, Canada, there were 
1.7 new cases of TBI per 1000 population in 2010/11, an 
increase of moe than 20% since 2004/05.5 Traumatic brain 
injury may result in long-term disability and is a major cause 
of death and disability.6,7 The impacts of TBI are broad and 
diverse and may include behavioural changes and cognitive 
impairment.7,8
Potential behavioural consequences of TBI, such as 
aggression and impulsivity, could increase propensity for 
involvement with criminal justice.9–12 Some meta-analyses 
have shown that the lifetime prevalence of TBI is high among 
those in correctional facilities and may be substantially higher 
than the general population.13–15 This finding has also been 
reported in Canada.16,17 Four longitudinal studies examined 
the association between TBI and criminal justice involvement 
and focused on criminality and violent crime.18–21 All sug-
gested an association between TBI and criminal justice 
involvement, although results were not always significant.18–21
Our study builds on the literature regarding TBI and crim-
inal justice involvement, with a particular focus on serious and 
chronic offending. Our overall objective was to determine if 
prior TBI was associated with an increased risk of incarcera-
tion among men and women.

Background: There is recent evidence to suggest that sustaining a traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases risk of criminal justice 
system involvement, including incarceration. The objective of this study was to explore the association between TBI and risk of 
incarceration among men and women in Ontario.
Methods: We identified a cohort of 1.418 million young adults (aged 18–28 yr) on July 1, 1997, living in Ontario, Canada, from 
administrative health records; they were followed to Dec. 31, 2011. History of TBI was obtained from emergency and hospital 
records, and incarceration history was obtained from the Correctional Service of Canada records. We estimated the hazard of incar-
ceration using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for relevant sociodemographic characteristics and medical history.
Results: There were 3531 incarcerations over 18 297 508 person-years of follow-up. The incidence of incarceration was higher 
among participants with prior TBI compared with those without a prior TBI. In fully adjusted models, men and women who had sus-
tained a TBI were about 2.5 times more likely to be incarcerated than men and women who had not sustained a TBI.
Interpretation: Traumatic brain injury was associated with an increased risk of incarceration among men and women in Ontario. 
Our research highlights the importance of designing primary, secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to mitigate risk of TBI and 
incarceration in the population.

people sentenced by the courts to 2 years or more of incarcera-
tion. Such sentences would be characteristic for persons com-
mitting a serious offence or who are chronically in contact 
with the criminal justice system.22
Participants
Potential participants aged 18–28 years on July 1, 1997 (i.e., 
the index date), were included if they were eligible for health 
care in Ontario between Jan. 1, 1993, and July 1, 1997 (i.e., 
listed in the Registered Persons Database, a population-based 
registry for health care maintained by the Ontario Ministry of 
Health and Long-Term Care).23 This age group was selected 
because of their high risk of TBI and criminal justice involve-
ment.5,24,25 Participants remained in the cohort until they were 
federally incarcerated, died or lost their eligibility for health 
care. Ontario’s administrative health data do not consistently 
capture those who emigrate from the province and would be 
ineligible for health care: we assumed men without health care 
utilization in 5 years and women without health care utiliza-
tion in 3 years were no longer in the province, and their date 
of ineligibility was the date of last contact plus 3 or 5 years. 
Longer time since last contact was allowed for young men as 
they are less likely to seek health care.26,27
Data sources and linkage
This study linked administrative health data sets to correc-
tional records. Health data sets included the Registered Per-
sons Database, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan database, 
the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge 
Abstracts Database and National Ambulatory Care Reporting 
System. Correctional records were obtained from the 
Offender Management System, a computerized record system 
that tracks information from admission until sentence com-
pletion that is maintained by the Correctional Service of Can-
ada, the government agency responsible for supervising per-
sons with federal sentences.28 All people who enter a federal 
correctional facility will be recorded in the Offender Manage-
ment System, and these data have 100% population coverage. 
Data sets were linked using unique encoded identifiers and 
analyzed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, 
Toronto; this linkage is described elsewhere.29
Variable definitions
The outcome was federal incarceration, defined as admission 
date to a federal facility, obtained from the Offender Manage-
ment System. The accuracy of admission date has not been 
systematically studied in the Offender Management System. 
We retained the first federal sentence occurring between 
Jan. 1, 1998, and Mar. 31, 2011. We excluded anyone with 
suspended records (i.e., pardoned).
Traumatic brain injury was the exposure of interest. Peo-
ple with a recorded diagnosis of TBI in the Discharge 
Abstracts Database or the National Ambulatory Care Report-
ing System between July 1, 1997, and Sept. 30, 2010, were 
classified as sustaining a TBI. The Discharge Abstracts Data-
base contained hospital discharges and the National Ambula-
tory Care Reporting System contained emergency depart-
ment visits. Although these are national databases, we only 
had access to Ontario data. Classification of TBI was based on 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision [Clinical 
Modification] (ICD-9) codes and International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th 
revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes. We considered ICD-9 
codes 800–801, 803–804, 850–854.1 or 959.01,30 or ICD-10 
codes S02.0, S02.1, S02.3, S02.7, S02.8, S02.9, S06, S07.1, 
T90.2 or T90.5 as TBI-related visits.30,31
Traumatic brain injury since index was treated as a binary 
time-varying covariate. We lagged the exposure variable by 
6 months to account for time between committing the related 
crime and entering the prison system. In 2008, this median 
time was about 3 months;32 by lagging the exposure variable 
to 6 months, we reduced the possibility that TBI was sus-
tained after the crime was committed for most of the cohort.
Individual-level covariates were age, sex, rurality, prior 
history of TBI and history of a mental health diagnosis at 
baseline. Covariates were selected a priori based on their 
associations with TBI and/or incarceration5,25,33–39 and their 
availability in administrative data. Age, sex and rurality 
(residential postal code) were extracted from the Registered 
Persons Database. History of TBI between Jan. 1, 1993, and 
July 1, 1997, was obtained from the Discharge Abstracts 
Database or the Ontario Health Insurance Plan database, the 
latter containing all physician billings. We did not ascertain 
lifetime history of TBI because of data quality concerns in 
Ontario’s administrative data before 1993. We considered 4 
types of mental health diagnoses: psychotic disorders (ICD-9 
codes 295–298),40 nonpsychotic disorders (ICD-9 codes 300–
302, 306, 309 and 311),40 substance abuse disorders (ICD-9 
codes 291–292 and 303–304)40,41 or social problems (ICD-9 
codes 897–902, 904–906 and 909).40 If a participant had at least 
1 of these diagnostic codes in the applicable databases between 
Jan. 1, 1995, and June 30, 1997, we considered them to have 
had a mental health diagnosis.
We used 3 neighbourhood-level measures from the 
Ontario Marginalization Index that are widely used in 
Ontario: ethnic concentration, material deprivation and resi-
dential instability.42–44
Statistical analyses
We performed descriptive analyses, by TBI, over follow-up. 
We also calculated the crude incidence of federal incarcera-
tion for men and women.
To examine the association between TBI and federal incar-
ceration, we used an extended Cox proportional hazards model 
with time-varying covariates.45 Data were organized as a count-
ing process structure with a July 1, 1997, origin.46 Participants 
stopped contributing to the Cox model on their date of first 
federal incarceration, death, loss of health care eligibility or 
Mar. 31, 2011. Because persons were censored at the time of 
first federal incarceration and we lagged the exposure variable 
by 6 months, we reduced the possibility of protopathic bias.
We report crude and multivariable adjusted hazard ratios 
(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for men and women. 
Multivariable models were adjusted for age, neighbourhood

marginalization, prior history of TBI and mental health diag-
nosis history. We also ran a pooled model to test for an interac-
tion by sex. The proportionality assumption was not violated.45
We handled missing data as follows: complete case analy-
ses and modelling missing as a separate category. The results 
were similar, and we report the findings from the complete-
case analyses. Because the proportion of missing data was so 
small (< 5%), it is unlikely that our statistical inference was 
biased by missingness.47–49
Sensitivity analysis
We performed 7 sensitivity analyses: we excluded participants 
who reported TBI between 1993 and 1997 to obtain an “inci-
dent” cohort; we excluded participants whose correctional 
records were linked to health records probabilistically;29 we 
lagged the TBI exposure variable by 1 year; we did not lag the 
TBI exposure variable; we broadened the definition of TBI to 
include primary care visits; we estimated risk of incarceration 
for participants who were discharged from the emergency 
department for TBI and those who were admitted to hospital 
for TBI; and we treated TBI as a 3-level exposure variable: 0 
TBI, 1 TBI, or 2 or more TBI.
Ethics approval
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at 
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, and received 
additional approvals from St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, 
and the University of Toronto.
Results
We included 748 393 men and 731 013 women in the study 
cohort. Table 1 presents baseline characteristics of partici-
pants by TBI over follow-up. There were 77 519 participants 
(5.2%) who sustained at least 1 TBI. After excluding those 
with missing data, 716 585 men and 701 480 women 
remained. Together, they contributed 18 297 508 person-
years of follow-up (mean [SD] = 12.7 (3.19) yr, median [inter-
quartile range] = 13.7 [13.74–13.74] yr).
Table 2 presents the rate of federal incarceration for men 
overall and by characteristics of interest, as well as unadjusted 
and adjusted HRs. There were 3321 men who were incarcer-
ated federally over follow-up, yielding an incidence rate of 
35.9 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 34.7–37.2). The inci-
dence of incarceration was higher among men who had sus-
tained a TBI (102.6 per 100 000 person-years, 95% CI 91.9–
113.2) compared with men who had not sustained a TBI (33.5 
per 100 000 person-years, 95% CI 32.1–34.5). In unadjusted 
models, men who had sustained a TBI had a 3-times greater 
hazard of incarceration than men who had not sustained a 
TBI. The association attenuated in fully adjusted models 
(HR  2.47, 95% CI 2.21–2.77).
Table 3 presents data for women. There were 210 women 
who were federally incarcerated over 9 058 616 person-years of 
follow-up, yielding an incidence rate of 2.3 per 100 000 person-
years (95% CI 2.0–2.6). In crude models, TBI increased the 
hazard of incarceration about 4-fold. In fully adjusted models, 
the hazard of incarceration was 2.76 times higher in women 
with, as opposed to without, a TBI (95% CI 1.65–4.60).
We did not find evidence of an interaction between TBI, 
sex and risk of incarceration (p = 0.7).
Table 4 presents estimates from our sensitivity analyses. 
Among men, TBI was a risk factor for incarceration regard-
less of the exposure or cohort definition. Among women, the 
magnitude of association between TBI and risk of incarcera-
tion was strong but not significant in 3 analyses. We also 
found a suggestion of a dose–response relationship between 
number of TBIs and risk of incarceration among men.
Interpretation
We conducted a population-based cohort study to explore the 
association between TBI and risk of incarceration for serious

and chronic offending. Our findings show that sustaining a 
TBI was associated with an increased risk of incarceration for 
such offences. The relative association was similar among men 
and women, and was upheld in a variety of sensitivity analyses, 
although estimates were less precise and not always significant 
among women.
These findings contribute to emerging research suggesting 
that TBI is an important risk factor for criminal justice 
involvement18–20 and builds on this evidence.19
A more novel contribution of our research is the sex-based 
analyses. Schofield and colleagues examined how TBI affects 
incarceration risk among men and women separately.19 They 
found that men and women with a history of TBI were about 
1.5 times more likely to have a corrective services record than 
those without a history of TBI. Although the confidence lim-
its for women were wide, reflecting the small number of 
women who were incarcerated in our study, they are consis-
tent with Schofield and colleagues’ research:19 the relative 
increase in incarceration risk was similar among men and 
women who sustained a TBI.19 Prior research has found that 
multiple head injuries are prevalent in correctional popula-
tions: in the United Kingdom, 32% of young men reported 
more than 1 TBI with a loss of consciousness.50 Our study 
reports the hypothesis that multiple head injuries may 
increase risk of incarceration.
We report effect sizes consistent with Sweden18 and almost 
twice as large as those in Australia,20 Finland21 and New Zea-
land.19 Such inconsistences may arise from different outcome 
definitions. Studies reporting smaller effect sizes used a more 
general outcome of criminality,19–21 whereas the study in Swe-
den, with a similar effect size, only examined violent crime.18 It 
may be that the types of crimes committed, or the length of 
sentences received, differ in people with and without a prior 
TBI, and these differences may drive the stronger associations. 
Differences could also be caused by other aspects of 
research methodology. For example, we modelled TBI as a 
time-varying exposure that allowed us to capture TBI at the 
time of incarceration, instead of assuming TBI was stable over 
follow-up. If TBI is positively associated with criminal justice 
involvement, as it appears to be, such misclassification would 
have biased effect estimates in previous studies toward the 
null. In addition, studies were conducted in countries with 
diverse criminal justice and health care systems: differences in 
effect sizes could be related to broader societal factors. Most 
importantly, taken together, the body of research supports the 
hypothesis that TBI is associated with an increased risk of 
criminal justice involvement.18–21
Limitations
Traumatic brain injury was measured using diagnosis codes 
from emergency department and hospital visits, and we may 
have missed persons with mild TBI who were not treated in 
these settings: a New Zealand study suggested that 95% of all 
TBIs are mild.24 In a sensitivity analysis, we relaxed the defini-
tion of TBI to include physician visits and the association 
remained. We intended to explore severity of TBI by assigning 
ICD diagnoses based severity scores, but we were unable to 
assign scores to 35% of the population with TBI because these 
ICD codes were head injury, unspecified. However, our sensi-
tivity analyses found that men and women admitted to hospital 
with a TBI were more likely to be incarcerated than men and 
women who were discharged from the emergency department 
with a TBI, which suggests the risk of incarceration could be 
greater for those with more severe TBI. We also acknowledge 
potential measurement error in our control variables that 
could introduce residual confounding (e.g., mental health was 
captured using diagnosis codes, and medical attention is not 
sought by all people with mental illness).51 We did not have 
information on severity of impulsivity and substance use in the 
administrative data, both of which have been associated with 
TBI and criminal justice involvement.33,52 Although failing to

account for this could have biased effect estimates, we did not 
expect residual confounding to be the driving explanation 
behind our findings given the magnitude of association 
observed. Thinking about generalizability, this study examined 
the association between TBI and chronic and serious offend-
ing. Although our findings are consistent other research, we 
cannot say with certainty that the association would hold for 
more general criminal justice involvement. We did not have 
information on admissions to provincial facilities. We fully 
recognize that the pathway to incarceration and criminal jus-
tice involvement is complex. Relationships may be bidirec-
tional (e.g., impulsive behaviour and substance abuse can be a 
cause or consequence of TBI18,19 and not all persons with a 
TBI will go on to be incarcerated). More research is needed to 
deconstruct how TBI could play a role in these pathways and if 
different mechanisms of injury (e.g., motor vehicle collisions v. 
falls) affect incarceration risk differently.
Conclusion
We found that TBI was associated with an increased risk of 
incarceration for serious and chronic offending among both 
men and women. Our findings are based on a large popula-
tion-based cohort of young adults who were followed for an 
average of about 13 years and are consistent with research 
reported elsewhere. Future research should focus on primary, 
secondary and tertiary prevention, which may help to reduce 
incarceration or improve the outcomes of persons with TBI 
who are incarcerated.
