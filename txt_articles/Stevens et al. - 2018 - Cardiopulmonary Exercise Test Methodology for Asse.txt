Background:
Concise
methodological
directions
for
administration
of
serial
cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) are needed for testing of patients with
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Maximal CPET is used
to evaluate the coordinated metabolic, muscular, respiratory and cardiac contributions to
energy production in patients with ME/CFS. In this patient population, CPET also elicits
a robust post-exertional symptom flare (termed, post-exertional malaise); a cardinal
symptom of the disease. CPET measures are highly reliable and reproducible in both
healthy and diseased populations. However, evidence to date indicates that ME/CFS
patients are uniquely unable to reproduce CPET measures during a second test, despite
giving maximal effort during both tests, due to the effects of PEM on energy production.
Methodology: To document and assess functional impairment due to the effects of
post-exertional malaise in ME/CFS, a 2-day CPET procedure (2-day CPET) has been
used to first measure baseline functional capacity (CPET1) and provoke post-exertional
malaise, then assess changes in CPET variables 24 h later with a second CPET to assess
the effects of post-exertional malaise on functional capacity. The second CPET measures
changes in energy production and physiological function, objectively documenting the
effects of post-exertional malaise. Use of CPET as a standardized stressor to induce
post-exertional malaise and quantify impairment associated with post-exertional malaise
has been employed to examine ME/CFS pathology in several studies. This article
discusses the results of those studies, as well as the standardized techniques and
procedures for use of the 2-day CPET in ME/CFS patients, and potentially other fatiguing
illnesses.
Conclusions: Basic concepts of CPET are summarized, and special considerations
for performing CPET on ME/CFS patients are detailed to ensure a valid outcome. The
2-day CPET methodology is outlined, and the utility of the procedure is discussed for
assessment of functional capacity and exertion intolerance in ME/CFS.

CPET for Determining Exercise Intolerance
BACKGROUND
A 2-day cardiopulmonary exercise test methodology (2-day
CPET) was cited by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (1)
as a potentially useful tool to aid in the diagnosis and
assessment of functional capacity in patients with Myalgic
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). The
IOM report concluded that ME/CFS is a neuroimmune
pathology that affects multiple systems and contributes to
exertion intolerance or an inability to recover normally following
physical, cognitive or emotional exertion (1, 2). The IOM
determined that “ME/CFS patients often have a level of fatigue
that is more profound, more devastating, and longer lasting
than that observed in patients with other fatiguing disorders”
(1). The fatigue in ME/CFS differs from that experienced by
controls and is unlike the fatigue associated with deconditioning.
It is often described as “flu-like” and frequently includes
“brain fog” or cognitive difficulties and other symptoms. This
abnormal response to exertion is a hallmark symptom of ME/CFS
referred to as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is among the
primary debilitating symptoms of ME/CFS, as well as fatigue-
related impairment lasting more than 6 months, unrefreshing
sleep, and usually cognitive impairment (brain fog) and/or
dysautonomia. Muscle and/or joint pain often accompany these
other symptoms, any of which could force a person with ME/CFS
to stop work, avoid physical activity and, consequently, further
reduce functional ability.
The lack of definitive biomarkers and no known cause
or cure for ME/CFS contribute to patients suffering through
medical misinterpretation, misunderstanding, and an overt bias
toward characterizing the illness as a psychosomatic disorder.
However, studies of exercise capacity reveal that a 2-day
CPET procedure can provide evidence of the pathophysiology
underlying the PEM that characterizes patients with ME/CFS
(3–6). CPET methodology is standardized as a well-accepted
procedure to assess physiological responses to exertion in many
illness conditions (7). Adaptation of this valid, standardized and
reliable procedure to assess abnormalities associated with PEM
is particularly useful for identifying impairment in patients with
fatigue-related illnesses. The purpose of this paper is to provide
guidelines and helpful practices to applying CPET techniques in
patients with ME/CFS.
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing
Analysis of expired gases during an exercise test generates values
that are useful in the assessment of functional capacity, illness
severity, and illness characterization in ME/CFS. For instance,
peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) is a well-recognized
objective indicator of functional capacity (8–11), and may be
used to assess disease severity and predict coronary heart disease

and all-cause mortality (12–14). Additionally, VO2peak provides
a foundation to evaluate metabolic functional impairment. A
CPET allows for the comprehensive and integrated analyses
of cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic and work indices to
help discern the etiology of exertion intolerance in a growing
population of patients with multiple chronic comorbidities (15).
It can be applied similarly to better understand disease pathology
in ME/CFS.
Classically, a single CPET provides physiological measures
at rest and throughout incremental exercise to determine
energy producing capacity at metabolically relevant time points
including anaerobic threshold and peak effort. However, for
ME/CFS patients, serial exercise tests are particularly useful to
explore the unique post-exertional pathology associated with
the illness. With a 2-day CPET, baseline functional capacity
is determined with the first test, which also serves as a
standardized stressor to elicit a post-exertional symptom flare.
The second exercise test 24 h later provides a metric of change
in physiological function due to the post-exertional response,
and can indicate magnitude of impairment associated with a
patient’s compromised recovery. Doing the second exercise test
24 h following the first test allows comparison of performance
capability without confounding influences of delayed onset
muscle soreness. This serial CPET methodology is not unique
to ME/CFS, and was reported previously to assess hormonal
responses following an exercise stressor in overtrained athletes
(16). Use of the 2-day CPET methodology in ME/CFS is of
increasing interest for the same purpose; to assess a patient’s
ability to recover normally following exertion.
CPET Measures Are Reliable and
Reproducible
The 2-day CPET methodology is useful for assessing impaired
recovery because CPET measures are readily reproduced in
both healthy and diseased populations. Therefore, a failure to
reproduce CPET measures on a subsequent test, despite peak
effort on both tests, indicates a derangement of homeostasis.
Peak Oxygen Consumption
VO2peak is a highly reliable and objective measure of functional
capacity (11, 17, 18). The reproducibility, or variability of this
measure from one day to the next is also low. This is true across
a broad population of healthy adults (11, 13, 17), children (19),
and in those with pathologies such as heart failure (20–22),
pulmonary hypertension (23), end-stage renal disease (24), cystic
fibrosis (25), mild-moderate COPD (26), and stroke (27). Thus,
VO2peak provides an objective measure of baseline functional
capacity or maximal ability to produce energy for work. Failure
to reproduce VO2peak during a second serial CPET, despite
peak effort on both tests, implicates impairment of recovery
mechanisms. This impaired recovery is consistent with PEM and
suggests an underlying pathophysiology that contributes to an
abnormal post-exertional state. Further, the magnitude of a test-
retest decrement in VO2peak can be used to quantify the degree
of impairment associated with PEM.

CPET for Determining Exercise Intolerance
Anaerobic Threshold
While VO2 at peak effort is an objective measure of maximum
energy producing capacity; perhaps one of the most metabolically
and functionally relevant transition points during an incremental
exercise test is VO2 at anaerobic threshold. The VO2 and work
intensity at anaerobic threshold are important indices of capacity
to do continuous work, as activity above the anaerobic threshold
is rapidly fatiguing and cannot be sustained. Anaerobic threshold
is the exercise intensity at which the anaerobic contribution
to energy generation is significant enough to cause non-linear
increases in muscle and blood pH, lactate and carbon dioxide
concentration. This transition is typically identified using serial
measures of blood lactate obtained throughout an incremental
exercise test to ascertain at which VO2 a non-linear increase in
blood lactate occurs. The ventilatory stimulus of carbon dioxide
causes a similar response in expired ventilation to that of blood
lactate. This makes the ventilatory threshold a good non-invasive
metric for the anaerobic threshold, which is referred to as the
ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT).
Test-retest measures of oxygen consumption and work that
correspond with VAT are stable over time with the same
test modality, and vary within about 7–12% in both healthy
individuals (5, 6, 18, 28) and a number of other pathological
conditions (21, 22). Because VO2@VAT is a reliable and
reproducible measure, a reduction in VO2@VAT over serial
exercise tests indicates an underlying limitation in the capacity
to meet daily energy demands via aerobic energy production.
Functional Capacity of ME/CFS Patients
Peak oxygen consumption of ME/CFS patients obtained during
a single CPET has been used to characterize functional status in
adults with ME/CFS (5, 29–35) as well as adolescents (36, 37).
However, patients and/or physicians typically seek this type of
assessment after an individual has been physically inactive or low
active for at least 6 months. Because of this it is often argued that
low VO2peak in a patient with ME/CFS is due simply to physical
deconditioning.
Compared to healthy controls, VO2peak of adults with
ME/CFS varies from about 30-91% of predicted values for age
and sex (5, 30–35, 38). This compares to values for adolescents
with ME/CFS between 86 and 90% of predicted VO2peak for
healthy controls of similar age and sex (36, 37). While low,
values for some ME/CFS patients may be consistent with physical
deconditioning, and may not be considered clinically remarkable.
Consequently, VO2peak measured during a single CPET does
not necessarily provide objective evidence of impaired recovery
or PEM, whereas PEM is a cardinal symptom of ME/CFS, and
management of PEM is a primary goal of treatment. Therefore,
provocation of PEM may be accomplished using a standardized
stressor of a single CPET. However, quantifying functional
decrement due to PEM following the first CPET requires a second
CPET administered 24 h later to determine if the patient can
reproduce CPET measures within normal test-retest variability.
Assessing the severity of PEM is useful for treatment for ME/CFS,
and also provides objective evidence of impairment for purposes
of disability review. The balance of this paper will detail the effects
of PEM on recovery in ME/CFS and special considerations for
testing those with ME/CFS for a valid and objective assessment
of functional capacity and exertion intolerance.
RESULTS
Studies of 2-Day CPET in ME/CFS
Studies of exertion intolerance in ME/CFS using a 2-day
CPET methodology indicate an impaired ability of patients to
reproduce CPET results. Several studies have shown that ME/CFS
patients are unable to reproduce values for VO2peak on serial
CPETs (5, 6), VO2 at ventilatory threshold (6), and/or peak
workload, or workload at ventilatory threshold (4). Additionally,
abnormal responses to exercise such as hemodynamic or
ventilatory responses may be observed in ME/CFS patients.
Abnormalities in hemodynamic and ventilatory responses may
or may not appear in some patients during the first exercise
test, whereas others only display abnormalities during CPET2
following the onset of PEM.
Values for VO2, work rate and heart rate obtained at the VAT
can also be examined for reproducibility. For example, test-retest
VO2@VAT values are reliable and reproducible in both normal
subjects and in various pathological conditions (22). But ME/CFS
subjects often fail to reproduce values measured at VAT (3, 4).
Compared to VO2peak, VO2@VAT is more indicative of the
capacity to perform activities of daily living. Sustained activity at
intensities that exceed VO2@VAT will eventually result in fatigue
(15). Measures that coincide with VAT are important indicators
of metabolic impairment and delayed recovery in ME/CFS
patients. The failure to reproduce measures that correspond to
VAT may be useful for identifying metabolic anomalies of energy
production, and describing the magnitude of impairment due to
PEM.
DISCUSSION
CPET1 to CPET2 Decrement Indicates
Post-exertional Malaise
The post-exertional effect on energy production are signaled
by changes in values measured across two CPETs. Diminished
responses, or abnormal changes in metabolic, cardiac or
hemodynamic measures during incremental exercise indicate
impaired recovery due to muscular, cardiovascular, pulmonary
or autonomic dysfunction. Changes in these values from CPET1
to CPET2 should be compared to normal ranges for test-retest
reproducibility. Abnormal variability between tests is evidence
of impaired recovery where both symptoms and changes in
CPET values represent abnormal perturbation. An assessment
of 2-day CPET data should include comparisons with normal
age/sex values, and between CPETs for peak and VAT measures of
VO2, work output, heart rate, blood pressure, minute ventilation,
oxygen saturation, as well as transitional (rest to peak) changes
in all measures. Additionally, the VE/VCO2 slope or lowest
value during a CPET should be scrutinized for ventilatory
decompensation. The magnitude of change from CPET1 to
CPET2 is considered abnormal if in excess of normal test-retest
variability. CPET measures and normal test values appear in
Table 1. Additionally, patient reports of symptom flares with

VAT Is Highly Relevant for an ME/CFS
Patient
The majority of daily energy demand is met via aerobic metabolic
processes, which typically provides energy for daily activities such
as normal speed walking, seated tasks, and other activities of
daily living. A reduction in VAT following exertion in persons
with ME/CFS may force reliance on anaerobiosis to support
lower intensity work and subsequently lead to premature fatigue.
From a practical standpoint, a reduction in the workload at
which VAT occurs is believed to be consistent with the post-
exertional decrease in function that coincides with PEM in
ME/CFS patients. For example, with PEM induced by CPET1,

CPET for Determining Exercise Intolerance
it is not uncommon for patients to present with anaerobic
predominance (early anaerobiosis), even during seated rest at
the start of CPET2. Functionally, such patients rely on energy
produced via anaerobic metabolism simply to perform resting
and/or low level activities. It is not surprising when fatigue occurs
under these circumstances.
To determine the point at which VAT occurs during a CPET,
there may be several algorithms in the software of a metabolic
measurement system to identify the VAT breakpoint. Perhaps
most notable, the V-slope method, originally described by Beaver,
Wasserman and Whipp (50), makes use of the relationship
between minute ventilation (VE) and ventilatory removal of
carbon dioxide (VCO2) during incremental exercise to determine
the VAT. For consistency, the same algorithm should be used
to identify VAT for both tests within the 2-day CPET method.
An additional concern when testing ME/CFS patients is how
a potentially abnormal ventilatory response may impact the
determination of VAT. For this reason, VAT identified by an
algorithm should always be scrutinized by a person(s) familiar
with the determination of VAT to ascertain agreement with the
algorithm-derived VAT.
METHODOLOGY
Exercise Testing Considerations for
ME/CFS Patients
The objectives of the 2-day CPET method are to; (1)
assess VO2peak and VO2 at VAT during the first CPET,
in addition to other test variable kinetics, and (2) compare
measures from CPET1 and CPET2 to assess test reproducibility
and normality of recovery response following CPET1. To
ascertain the magnitude of change in CPET2 due to CPET1,
it is critical that the ME/CFS patient begin the test in a
baseline state representative of the patient’s well-rested capacity.
Characteristics unique to ME/CFS patients require special
pre-test preparations that should be addressed beginning as
early as 2–3 weeks prior to a scheduled 2-day CPET. The
objective is to minimize pre-fatigue and PEM in a patient
who is preparing to travel in order to complete the 2-day
CPET.
Pre-test Considerations
Factors such as travel to the test site, immediate pre-test (day of
or even day before) paperwork that taxes cognitive function, and
prolonged time in a common waiting area, even if seated, can all
contribute to pre-test fatigue. Fatigue and PEM are exacerbated
by physical, cognitive and emotional stressors (1), so every
effort should be made to reduce such stressors where possible.
Likewise, many ME/CFS patients experience hypersensitivity
to light, noise, temperature, odors, and/or chemicals, so it
is helpful to minimize environmental stimuli and maintain a
generally low level of activity in the waiting area and testing
environment.
Pretest directions/instructions should be in writing and given
to the patient at least 1–2 weeks prior to arrival at a clinic.
Included in these materials should be a clearly written pre-
test checklist to assure that the patient adheres to pre-test
preparation instructions (e.g., alcohol, caffeine, exercise and food
restrictions prior to CPET, appropriate attire, etc.). Directions to
the facility should include availability of disabled parking close
to the building, and clear directions to the elevator or other
lift assist as needed. Stairs (up and down) and long walks to
the clinic should be avoided if possible as this will pre-fatigue
the patient. It is reasonable to ask the patient prior to arrival if
wheelchair assistance is indicated. Likewise, it is essential that
the patient understands the importance of not becoming fatigued
prior to the test, and plans travel to the test site with that in mind.
When the test site is more than 1 h away, if feasible the patient
should be encouraged to arrive the day before the scheduled test
and spend the night locally. For some patients, 2 days of rest
following air travel to a clinic may be necessary. It is essential
that patients understand they should not drive a motor vehicle
away from the clinic following either CPET, and plan accordingly.
These recommendations may limit patient accessibility to testing,
but should be considered to optimize quality of CPET data and
patient safety.
Pre-test Forms/Questionnaires
Forms and questionnaires should be sent to the patient at least
2–3 weeks prior to a scheduled test. Completion of forms can
be cognitively taxing for a person with ME/CFS and contribute
to PEM, so sufficient time should be allowed for completion
and return of forms to the clinic. In a clinic environment where
a physician is present only part-time, prior arrangements are
necessary to provide medical supervision during the 2-day CPET
when testing a patient that meets criteria for high risk (7, 45).
Similarly, sufficient time is necessary for the patient’s physician
to complete and return the referral form prior to testing the
ME/CFS patient. Information provided to the patient should
include explicit pretest instructions. Patients who experience
cognitive impairment may be unable to process and respond
quickly to copious or complex information, so providing simple,
easily understood documentation helps improve adherence to
pretest instructions. Paperwork that should be sent to the
patient 2–3 weeks prior to a scheduled test may include the
following:
• General information about test, payment options, clinic
contact information
• Directions to clinic/parking, elevator, etc.
• Area lodging information, indicating hotels that provide
shuttle service to your clinic
• Physician consent form
• Medical/health history form
• Informed consent document
• Fatigue status questionnaire; e.g., Bell Fatigue Scale (51), Short
Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36.org), Multidimensional Fatigue
Inventory (52), Fatigue Impact Scale (53)
• List
of
medications/non-prescription
medications/
supplements
• Day of test instructions (what not to eat/drink, appropriate
clothing, etc.)
• Release of information form
• Recovery strategies/aids

CPET for Determining Exercise Intolerance
Medications/Supplements
The use of medications prior to testing must be clarified with
the patient. If the purpose of testing is for clinical evidence of
impairment or assessment of PEM, medications, including OTC
medications, and supplements should be taken as prescribed, and
at the same time of day prior to each CPET. However, for both
research purposes and clinical diagnosis, limiting medications
would be determined after consultation with the referring
physician.
Test-Day Considerations
-Seek to minimize time in the waiting area prior to preparations
for a CPET. A place to recline or semi-recline is helpful
for a waiting patient, or when reviewing or clarifying pretest
paperwork and procedures with the patient.
-Provide water throughout testing, and following CPET2,
electrolyte replacement beverages can be helpful. Many ME/CFS
patients have orthostatic intolerance so maintaining hydration
with fluid and electrolytes (e.g., coconut water, sport drink)
following CPET2 is helpful for expediting recovery. There are a
number of anecdotal reports of plasma volume or salt loading
reducing recovery time. Patients may consider arranging with
their physician for a prescription of 1 L of IV normal saline
infusion following completion of the 2-day CPET. However, if
possible, there should be no intervention between the two CPETs.
Pretest Procedures
-CPET1 session should begin by explaining the entire test day
procedure in detail. Prior to obtaining informed consent, respond
to all patient questions.
-Review the completed pretest forms, and seek clarification
of information if necessary. Additional questionnaires or
procedures (e.g., title table test, cognitive tests, lung function
measures, etc.) should be limited to minimize pre-fatiguing the
patient. Body weight should be measured (not self-reported)
prior to each CPET, and height should be measured before
CPET1. After 5 min of supine rest, obtain resting heart rate,
blood pressure, O2 saturation, temperature, and monitor ECG.
Monitoring the ECG throughout exercise testing is important
for determining rate, rhythm and potential ischemia of cardiac
tissue. Since many patients experience orthostatic symptoms, it
is important to take measures after 5 min of supine rest and also
during seated rest on the cycle ergometer prior to exercise.
-Explain use of the facemask or two-way valve to collect
expired gases while the patient is supine. At this time, introduce
and explain the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE)/Borg scale
(48). Specify anchor intensities of 6 and 20 (or 0 and 10 for the
modified scale) as the lowest and highest ratings of perceived
exertion.
-Pain and dyspnea scales should be explained at this time as
well. The seat height of the cycle ergometer should be adjusted
to fit the subject and recorded, and the subject allowed to pedal
at 0 Watts for a short period (<1 min). This will help the subject
feel comfortable on the ergometer and reduce anxiety. To ensure
safety during and after the CPET the patient should be monitored
closely for adverse effects with continuous measures of blood
pressure, oxygen saturation, ECG, and other indicators of stress.
Test Modality
A cycle ergometer is preferred to a treadmill for CPET testing
of ME/CFS patients. While walking is a familiar activity for
most and involves larger muscle groups, a cycle ergometer
allows for easy quantification of work output and metabolic cost
of exercise. There is less noise artifact for cardiac monitoring
and measurement of blood pressure on a cycle ergometer, and
fluctuation in work output from holding treadmill handrails,
and biomechanical efficiency is less of a concern. Additionally,
problems with balance and instability in some patients,
particularly when close to maximum effort, are minimized when
using a cycle ergometer. Patients generally feel more secure and
comfortable on a cycle vs. a treadmill. Although VO2peak may
be 10–15% lower in healthy individuals when measured using a
cycle ergometer compared to a treadmill, the benefits of safety
and security on the cycle ergometer for the ME/CFS patient
outweigh the risks associated with treadmill exercise for this
population (54). Lastly, for accurate interpretation of test-retest
findings it is critical to precisely reproduce the CPET1 workload
protocol during CPET2, which can be accomplished more readily
with the cycle ergometer. Ideally, an electronically-braked cycle
ergometer affords the most accurate workload measures, and also
provides smooth workload transitions for the patient. Cycle seat
height should be the same for both CPETs.
Test Protocol
Selection of the test protocol should be matched closely with the
anticipated ability of the patient. The goal of the test protocol
is to incrementally challenge energy production such that the
patient is able to complete at least 8 min but no more than
12 min of cycling (45). For moderately ill ME/CFS patients who
complete this protocol, workload increments of 10–15 W/min,
beginning at 0 watts, is appropriate to achieve an 8–12 min
test to maximum effort duration. However, for a patient with a
significant history of physical training, a 20 or 25 W/min protocol
may be appropriate. The same protocol should be used for CPET1
and CPET2. Typically, the following cycle ergometer protocol is
used for testing the ME/CFS patient:
• START: 3 min seated rest on cycle—monitor ECG, VO2, and
record BP and O2 saturation at min 2.
• EXERCISE PROTOCOL: first minute exercise stage—begin at
0 watts (no prior warm-up) and increase 10–15 watts per min,
or as appropriate.
• DURING EXERCISE: Measure BP/O2 saturation/RPE every
2 min (e.g., @ 15W, 45W, 75W, etc.).

CPET for Determining Exercise Intolerance
closely scrutinize patient effort. Therefore, criteria for maximal
effort should be reported which could include; plateau in oxygen
consumption with increases in workload, RPE ≥ 18 (6–20 scale),
respiratory exchange ratio (RER) ≥ 1.1, or peak blood lactate
≥ 8 mM. These criteria support evidence of maximum effort
during CPET. The RER criterion is generally considered a more
valid indicator of patient effort compared to the other indicators
(55). Generally, satisfying two of three criteria is acceptable to
determine that maximum effort was given by the patient (56).
However, it would be inappropriate and unethical to prime
the patient regarding effort criteria, therefore, consistency of
procedures and patient motivation during both CPETs should be
maintained for a valid comparison between CPETs.
Patient Risk
As with any maximal effort CPET, risk is conferred to the patient
in completing such a test. Risk reduction is mitigated through
standard procedures that include obtaining a relevant health
history and completed cardiovascular disease risk questionnaire,
a physician referral for testing, and clarifying with the patient any
signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, pulmonary or
metabolic diseases. Standardized guidelines for exercise testing
are available and should guide decision making regarding risk
classification of a patient and the need for medical oversight
when conducting a CPET (7, 45, 57). When testing ME/CFS
patients, it is not uncommon to find they may be well-screened
for cardiovascular, pulmonary or metabolic disease risk in the
course of trying to obtain a diagnosis of their illness symptoms.
Due largely to the lack of knowledge and understanding of
ME/CFS by medical professionals, average time from onset
of ME/CFS symptoms to diagnosis is greater than 1 year,
but 29 percent of patients surveyed reported that receiving a
diagnosis took longer than 5 years (58, 59). Throughout efforts
to obtain a diagnosis, patients commonly, but not always, visit
and are screened by internists, cardiologists, rheumatologists,
and others. Yet, there is insufficient evidence among this patient
population to fully understand the relative risk to ME/CFS
patients who complete the 2-day CPET procedure. As well,
there is no evidence to suggest that the risk of untoward
cardiovascular events varies from the general population. Due
to the fact that many patients are well-screened prior to CPET
testing, it could be suggested that risk for such an event may
even be less than that of the general population. For ME/CFS
patients, the greater concern of performing an exercise test is
that associated with the potential for exacerbation or worsening
of their typical PEM symptom profile. Because the disease is
cyclic in nature, with patients often experiencing periods of
remission and reactivation, and due to insufficient data on CPET
testing in sufficiently large numbers of patients, it is unknown if
performance of an exercise test, either submaximal or maximal,
could worsen the overall illness status. Exacerbation of PEM
symptoms via exercise is an inherent risk but also central to
the efficacy of the 2-day CPET methodology, which should be
acknowledged in the informed consent document. Most patients
are well aware of their PEM symptom complex and the temporal
expression of symptoms. However, particularly in patients who
recently became ill, the exacerbation of symptoms due to exercise
testing may coincide with the natural cyclic progression of the
illness, and result in more severe and longer exacerbation of
symptoms than is typical. Hence, it is difficult to predict the
extent to which symptoms may flare and for how long. Patients
should be fully aware of this risk prior to consenting to an
exercise test. Strategies to minimize pretest energy expenditure
during travel to a test site, preparation for an exercise test,
and mitigating posttest symptom exacerbation are listed in
Table 2.
Calibration and Quality Control
Calibration of the metabolic cart is essential prior to and
following each CPET to assure accuracy and validity of data. Of
equal importance, is biological validation for long-term stability
of metabolic cart accuracy.
Quality Assurance - Biological validation for quality assurance
is also essential for valid data. Reproducibility of gas exchange
measurements
requires
consistent
testing
methodology.
Biological quality control can identify error not detected by
automated calibration of the metabolic measurement system
(60). Even when automated system calibration appears accurate,
results may be erroneous (61). Biological validation can be
achieved by testing laboratory staff on a monthly basis at
matched submaximal work rates, and for VO2/work rate
slope (62).
In general, routine maintenance based on the manufacturer’s
recommendation is essential for internal validity of data from the
metabolic measurement system and electronic cycle ergometer.

TRAVEL
1. Avoid waiting in long security lines. Call the airline for a wheelchair in order to
conserve energy and bypass the line. Be sure to check in at skycap and they will
have a wheelchair waiting.
2. Preboard the flight for extra time to store belongings.
3. Sign up for TSA pre check. The security lines are shorter and there is no need to
remove shoes and computers from carry-on luggage.
4. Travel with noise canceling headphones, earplugs or both.
5. Bring an eye mask and travel pillow to make the trip more restful.
6. Cover your face with a mask to avoid unwanted germs.
7. Bring healthy snacks.
8. Wear compression socks or compression calf sleeves to promote circulation and
reduce fatigue.
9. Travel to your destination a day early and take a day or more to rest if needed.
HOTEL
1. Ask for a quiet room away from the ice machine.
2. Bring earplugs.
3. Use a white noise app.
4. If possible use a shower bench or sit down while showering.
5. Use a robe to dry off after showering.
6. Stay hydrated. Buy a bottle of water. If the hotel has a fitness center they usually
have filtered water for free refills and often have fresh fruit.
GENERAL RECOVERY
1. Take a warm bath with Epsom salts.
2. Stretch sore muscles slowly but frequently.
3. Pace activities by planning rest breaks during the day.
4. Use diaphragmatic breathing to promote relaxation and recovery.
5. Rest until recovered.

CPET for Determining Exercise Intolerance
The validity of comparison of CPET1 and CPET2 data relies on
valid and reliable measurement devices.
Software Considerations - Data sampling, averaging, graphical
and summary reports are determined by software supplied
with metabolic measurement systems. Sampling differences
can greatly affect test results. Breath by breath measurements
averaged over 15–20 s intervals will reduce the effect of random
noise and improve data consistency. It is essential to display data
in a tabular time down format with rest, start of exercise, and
peak exercise clearly delineated. Peak values should be selected
from data in time down format following visual inspection of data
for overt outliers due to coughing, gagging, sneezing or talking.
Only data from start of exercise to peak exercise should be used
to determine VAT.
CONCLUSIONS
Understanding and treating ME/CFS patients is hampered from a
lack of diagnostic markers, heterogeneity in patient presentation,
waxing and waning of symptoms within an individual patient,
poor understanding of disease pathology, and the need to exclude
other conditions. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing can provide
helpful insights into this disease by better characterizing the
unique post-exertional pathology of the illness.
Studies using one CPET-only are useful to elucidate immune
activity and/or gene expression in ME/CFS because strenuous
activity is known to induce considerable physiological changes
similar to those associated with trauma (29, 63). As a quantifiable
stressor, CPET has the capacity to reveal abnormalities across
multiple systems that may not be apparent at rest by assessing
the integrated response to exercise through comprehensive
evaluation of the pulmonary, cardiovascular, haematopoietic,
neuropsychological and musculo-skeletal systems (15). The
inclusion of CPET could also be a primary consideration
when designing clinical trials with functional endpoints (61).
Determination of the respiratory exchange ratio, a measure
exclusive to analysis of expired gases, provides the most accurate
and reliable gauge of subject effort. This avoids problems
associated with use of age-predicted maximal heart rate, which
varies significantly in the general population and can be
affected by both medication and pathology. Issues of response
bias in self-report indictors of effort are also avoided. In the
case of ME/CFS, the respiratory exchange ratio enables direct
comparison between patient and control with confidence that
both subjects were exposed to equivalent levels of physiological
stress. Single CPET studies are also be useful for objective
measurement of illness severity, pathophysiology, and for
monitoring illness progression.
By comparison, the 2-day CPET methodology is useful
for describing ME/CFS pathology as it provides objective and
measureable changes due to impaired recovery across the two
exercise tests. When the first test is conducted with a well-rested
subject in a non-exacerbated state, this methodology allows for
the characterization and quantification of post-exertional effects
on functional capacity. Effects may be identified to correspond
specifically to exercise at VAT or peak effort. Information
gleaned from a 2-day CPET also offers objective evidence of
impairment attributable to the effects of PEM, helps with patient
management, informs therapeutic interventions, and tracks
illness progression. Standardizing the 2-day CPET methodology
to assess ME/CFS and other fatiguing illnesses across testing sites
and study groups will allow for valid and relevant between-study
comparisons. The goal is to better understand how impaired
recovery impacts energy production and function, and hopefully
determine the underlying pathophysiology of PEM as a disease
component of ME/CFS.
