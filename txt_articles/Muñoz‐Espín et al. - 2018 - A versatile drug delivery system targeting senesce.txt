Abstract
Senescent cells accumulate in multiple aging-associated diseases,
and eliminating these cells has recently emerged as a promising
therapeutic approach. Here, we take advantage of the high lysoso-
mal b-galactosidase activity of senescent cells to design a drug
delivery system based on the encapsulation of drugs with galacto-
oligosaccharides. We show that gal-encapsulated fluorophores are
preferentially released within senescent cells in mice. In a model
of chemotherapy-induced senescence, gal-encapsulated cytotoxic
drugs target senescent tumor cells and improve tumor xenograft
regression in combination with palbociclib. Moreover, in a model
of pulmonary fibrosis in mice, gal-encapsulated cytotoxics target
senescent
cells,
reducing
collagen
deposition
and
restoring
pulmonary function. Finally, gal-encapsulation reduces the toxic
side effects of the cytotoxic drugs. Drug delivery into senescent
cells opens new diagnostic and therapeutic applications for senes-
cence-associated disorders.

Introduction
Severe or unrepairable cellular damage often triggers a stereotypic
cellular response known as senescence. This cellular program is
controlled by relatively well-understood pathways that stably block
cell proliferation and are conserved across vertebrates (Mun
˜oz-
Espı
´n & Serrano, 2014). The main purpose of cellular senescence is
to prevent the proliferation of damaged cells and, at the same time,
to trigger tissue repair through the secretion of a complex mixture of
extracellular factors, known as senescence-associated secretory
phenotype or SASP. Specifically, senescence-initiated tissue repair
involves the recruitment of inflammatory cells, the dismissal of
senescent cells by phagocytic and immune cells, and the activation
of stem/progenitor features in non-damaged surrounding cells (Kriz-
hanovsky et al, 2008; Demaria et al, 2014; Yun et al, 2015; Mosteiro
et al, 2016; Chiche et al, 2017; Ritschka et al, 2017). Even during
vertebrate development, embryos use senescence in a damage-inde-
pendent manner to initiate specific tissue remodeling processes
(Mun
˜oz-Espı
´n et al, 2013; Storer et al, 2013).
Upon persistent damage or during aging, senescent cells accumu-
late, probably due to an inefficient clearance by immune cells, and
this accumulation may lead to chronic inflammation and fibrosis
(Mun
˜oz-Espı
´n & Serrano, 2014). Indeed, evidence in mice indicates
that the accumulation of senescent cells actively contributes to
multiple diseases and aging (Mun
˜oz-Espı
´n & Serrano, 2014). In this
regard, genetic ablation of senescent cells delays and ameliorates
some aging-associated diseases, reverts long-term degenerative

 processes associated with chemotherapy, and extends longevity
(Baker et al, 2016; Childs et al, 2016; Demaria et al, 2017). Impor-
tantly, senescent cells present vulnerabilities to particular small
molecule inhibitors, known as “senolytics”, that trigger apoptosis
preferentially in senescent cells (Zhu et al, 2015). For example, the
combination of dasatinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of broad speci-
ficity) and quercetin (a flavonol with antioxidant and estrogenic
activity) has preferential toxicity over senescent cells compared to
control cells (Zhu et al, 2015). Also, the survival of senescent cells
is highly dependent on elevated levels of the BCL-2 family of anti-
apoptotic factors, and accordingly, senescent cells are hyper-sensi-
tive to apoptosis induced by navitoclax, a BCL-2 family inhibitor
(Chang et al, 2016; Yosef et al, 2016; Zhu et al, 2016; Pan et al,
2017). Similarly, inactivation of the transcription factor FOXA4
with a peptide derivative preferentially eliminates senescent cells
over non-senescent ones (Baar et al, 2017). These pharmacological
treatments reduce the number of senescent cells in vivo and show
therapeutic activity against senescence-associated diseases and
aging (Zhu et al, 2015, 2016; Chang et al, 2016; Roos et al, 2016;
Yosef et al, 2016; Baar et al, 2017; Pan et al, 2017; Schafer et al,
2017).
Senescent cells in vitro are characterized by high levels of lysoso-
mal b-galactosidase activity, known as senescence-associated b-
galactosidase (SAbGal; Dimri et al, 1995; Mun
˜oz-Espı
´n & Serrano,
2014; Kurz et al, 2000; Lee et al, 2006). In addition to b-galactosi-
dase, senescent cells present high levels of most tested lysosomal
hydrolases (Kna�
s et al, 2012). Indeed, senescent cells show a
remarkable accumulation of lysosomes, together with abnormal
endosomal traffic and autophagy (Cho et al, 2011; Narita et al,
2011; Ivanov et al, 2013; Udono et al, 2015; Tai et al, 2017). Inter-
estingly, damaged or diseased tissues generally contain cells that are
positive for SAbGal, while normal healthy tissues are negative for
this marker (Sharpless & Sherr, 2015).
Here, we have explored the possibility of using lysosomal b-galac-
tosidase as a vulnerable trait of senescent cells that can be exploited
to deliver tracers or drugs preferentially to diseased tissues with high
content of senescent cells. Our approach is based on the encapsula-
tion of diagnostic or therapeutic agents with b(1,4)-galacto-oligosac-
charides and their delivery to lysosomes via endocytosis. We show
that this delivery strategy is effective in vivo, and it is therapeutic in
the context of cancer chemotherapy and also against pulmonary
fibrosis. Moreover, our encapsulation system has the added value of
reducing the systemic toxicities of cytotoxic drugs.
Results
Validation of gal-encapsulation to target senescent cells in vitro
Sugar-coated beads (~100 nm diameter), based on a silica porous
scaffold known as MCM-41 (Kresge et al, 1992), are efficiently inter-
nalized into cells by endocytosis, targeted to the lysosomes, and
eventually released by exocytosis (Slowing et al, 2006, 2011; Tao
et al, 2009; Bernardos et al, 2010; Hocine et al, 2010; Yanes et al,
2013; Aznar et al, 2016). In a previous work (Agostini et al, 2012),
we designed beads pre-loaded with a fluorophore and then coated
with a layer of galacto-oligosaccharides of mixed lengths (referred to
as GosNP). We observed that b-galactosidase can digest the sugar
coating of the beads, thus allowing the diffusion of the cargo out of
the silica scaffold. Interestingly, fluorophore-loaded GosNP effi-
ciently release their content within senescent cells, in agreement
with the high levels of b-galactosidase activity of these cells (Agostini
et al, 2012). Here, we have improved this system by using a homoge-
neous coating mostly consisting of a 6-mer galacto-oligosaccharide
(referred to as GalNP) (Fig 1A and Appendix Fig S1A). Using this
strategy, we have encapsulated rhodamine B [GalNP(rho)], doxoru-
bicin [GalNP(dox)], and navitoclax [GalNP(nav)], and enzymatic
digestion of the three types of beads with fungal b-galactosidase
demonstrated
efficient
release
of
their
respective
cargos
(Appendix Fig S1B–E). In general, 100 mg of drug is encapsulated
per gram of beads and, upon digestion in vitro, ~30 mg of drug is
released per gram of beads (Appendix Tables S1–S3). Targeting of
senescent cells with GalNP(rho) was validated in three human
cancer cell lines treated with palbociclib (a selective CDK4/CDK6
inhibitor approved in combination with letrozole or fulvestrant for
hormone receptor+/HER2� metastatic breast cancer; Fig 1B and
Appendix Fig S1F and G). Of note, the three cell lines used, SK-MEL-
103, NCI-H226, and UT-SCC-42B, have an active retinoblastoma
pathway (RB1-proficient; Ikediobi et al, 2006; Giefing et al, 2011;
Massaro et al, 2017) and undergo senescence upon treatment with
palbociclib (Fig 1B and Appendix Fig S1F). In these cellular models,
the fluorophore was released more efficiently in senescent cells

A
GalNP beads are based on a mesoporous silica scaffold (MCM-41) that can be loaded with different cargoes encapsulated by a coat of 6-mer b(1,4)-galacto-
oligosaccharides. Cellular uptake of the GalNP beads occurs via endocytosis and, after fusion with lysosomal vesicles, the beads are released by exocytosis. The high
lysosomal b-galactosidase activity of senescent cells allows a preferential release of the cargo by a b-galactosidase-mediated hydrolysis of the cap.

SK-MEL-103 melanoma cells were treated with palbociclib (1 lM) for 1 week, and senescence induction was assessed by SAbgal staining. Next, cultures were exposed
to GalNP(rho) (50 lg/ml, for 16 h). Pictures show representative images illustrating rhodamine release by confocal microscopy. Cells were co-stained with Calcein,
and nuclei were stained with Hoechst. Graphs to the right show the rhodamine intensity relative to cell surface in senescent cells and non-senescent (control) cells.
Each assay was repeated at least three times with similar results. Scale bar: 50 lm.

gavage, 100 mg/kg) during 7 days. The left panel picture shows representative whole tissue portions of tumors after SAbGal staining. The right panel shows sections
of control and palbociclib-treated tumors processed for SAbGal staining, and Ki67 and phosphorylated Rb (p-Rb) immunohistochemistry. This experiment has been
repeated at least two times with similar results. Scale bar: 50 lm.

Mice bearing SK-MEL-103 xenografts, control or treated with palbociclib for 7 days, as in (C), were tail vein injected with 200 ll of a solution containing GalNP(rho)
(4 mg/ml). At 6 h post-injection, mice were sacrificed, tumors were collected, and fluorescence was analyzed by an IVIS spectrum imaging system. The graph
indicates the average difference in tumor radiance between GalNP-injected control and palbociclib-treated groups. The inset shows the absolute values of radiance
(p/s/cm2/sr × 106) for each group. The corresponding differences are highlighted in black or red. Values are expressed as mean � SD, and statistical significance was
assessed by the two-tailed Student’s t-test.

 compared to control cells, demonstrating the functionality of the
GalNP encapsulation method. Co-staining of cells with a lysosomal
marker indicated that a substantial fraction of rhodamine was
present in lysosomes (Appendix Fig S1H).
Release of gal-encapsulated fluorophores in xenografts
To evaluate the release of gal-encapsulated fluorophores in vivo, we
employed
tumor
xenografts
treated
with
senescence-inducing
chemotherapy. Subcutaneous xenografts were generated using SK-
MEL-103 melanoma cells and NCI-H226 lung squamous carcinoma
cells. Upon tumor formation, mice were treated daily with palboci-
clib for 7 days, and this resulted in high levels of intratumoral
senescence, as inferred from elevated SAbGal activity, absence of
the proliferative marker Ki67, and reduction in phosphorylated Rb
(Fig 1C). In a first approach, palbociclib-treated mice carrying SK-
MEL-103 xenografts were given a single intravenous injection of
GalNP(rho) and fluorescence was analyzed 6 h later. Palbociclib-
treated tumors were strongly autofluorescent (Fig 1D). Importantly,
however, rhodamine was detectable above background in mice
treated with GalNP(rho), and the signal attributed to rhodamine
was higher in tumors treated with palbociclib compared to non-
treated tumors (Fig 1D). Fluorescence was not detected in other
organs at 6 h post-injection, including liver, spleen, and lungs
(Appendix Fig S1I and see below Fig 2B). To avoid the detection of
autofluorescence, we used beads loaded with indocyanine green
(see Appendix Fig S1E), a fluorophore that emits in the far-red spec-
trum and therefore is minimally affected by the autofluorescence of
palbociclib-senescent cells. Confirming the rhodamine release data,
SK-MEL-103 and NCI-H226 xenografts treated with palbociclib and
gal-encapsulated indocyanine green showed much higher fluores-
cence compared to tumors treated with a single agent alone
(Appendix Fig S1J and K).
Release of gal-encapsulated fluorophores in pulmonary fibrosis
Cellular senescence is abundant in pulmonary fibrosis, both in
humans and in mice, and actively contributes to the pathological
manifestations of this disease (Aoshiba et al, 2003, 2013; Hecker
et al, 2014; Pan et al, 2017; Schafer et al, 2017). We wondered
whether our senescence delivery system would also work in a mouse
model of pulmonary fibrosis. Intratracheal instillation of bleomycin
in mice produced full-blown lung fibrosis in a period of 2 weeks,
accompanied by focal areas of SAbGal activity and strong collagen
deposition as indicated by Masson’s trichrome staining (Fig 2A).
Two weeks post-bleomycin administration, mice were intravenously
injected with GalNP(rho) and 6 h later fluorescence was measured
in the lungs. In this in vivo senescence model, autofluorescence was
less prominent than in the case of palbociclib-treated tumors. Impor-
tantly, rhodamine release occurred preferentially in fibrotic lungs
compared to healthy lungs (Fig 2B). Moreover, confocal microscopy
indicated that Rho+ cells were more abundant in fibrotic lung lesions
compared to non-fibrotic lungs (Fig 2C).
The differential fluorescence observed between fibrotic and
healthy lungs could conceivably reflect, at least in part, a different
accessibility and accumulation of the GalNP beads. To evaluate this,
we measured the levels of silicon in the lungs and other organs, 6 h
after i.v. injection of GalNP beads, by ICP-MS (inductively coupled
plasma mass spectroscopy). Interestingly, the levels of silicon in the
lungs and in other tissues were similar between control and bleo-
mycin-treated mice (Appendix Fig S2A). Therefore, the silica beads
reach equally well both healthy and fibrotic lungs (Appendix Fig
S2A); however, the release of the fluorophore preferentially occurs
within fibrotic lungs (Fig 2B and C). We also wondered if the GalNP
beads would retain their activity when administered intratracheally
rather than intravenously. Indeed, as in the case of i.v. injection,
intratracheal administration of the beads also produced preferential
cargo
release
in
fibrotic
lungs
compared
to
healthy
lungs
(Appendix Fig S2B).
Next, we set to characterize in detail the cells targeted by
GalNP(rho) in fibrotic lungs using flow cytometry. After exclud-
ing
endothelial
(CD31+)
and
hematopoietic
(CD45+)
cells
(Appendix Fig S2C), we quantified the relative number of Rho+ cells
in double-negative CD45�CD31� cells, which are mostly comprised
by lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Importantly, bleomycin-
treated lungs showed higher levels of Rho+CD45�CD31� cells than
control lungs (Fig 2D). Further analyses using the epithelial marker
EpCAM suggested that the large majority of Rho+CD45�CD31� cells

 corresponded to fibroblasts (EpCAM�) (Fig 2D). To directly test
whether
Rho+CD45�CD31�
cells
are
indeed
senescent,
CD45�CD31� cells from bleomycin-treated lungs were sorted into
Rho+ and Rho� subpopulations and subjected to RNAseq. Gene set
enrichment analyses (GSEA) using published signatures of senes-
cence (Lasry & Ben-Neriah, 2015) indicated that Rho+CD45�CD31�
cells present a significant upregulation of senescence signatures
(Fig 2E and Appendix Fig S2D and Dataset EV1). We also examined
the levels of Rho+ cells in endothelial, total hematopoietic cells,
lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. The majority of
Rho+ cells, both in healthy and fibrotic lungs, were macrophages.
However, the relative levels of Rho+ macrophages were reduced in
bleomycin-treated lungs, and the same trend was observed in the
other cell types (Appendix Fig S2E–G). Although the significance of
this reduction in Rho+ non-fibroblastic cells remains to be explored,
it could be due to competition by the Rho+ fibroblasts present in
the bleomycin-treated lungs. These results demonstrate in vivo that
GalNP beads release their cargoes within senescent fibroblasts and
can be used as a tool to detect and isolate senescent fibroblasts from
fibrotic tissues.
Therapeutic activity of gal-encapsulated cytotoxic drugs on
tumor xenografts
After demonstrating that GalNP beads preferentially release fluores-
cent cargoes within senescent cells, we wondered whether gal-
encapsulated cytotoxics would also target senescent cells in vivo.
We screened a panel of 80 anti-cancer drugs with the aim of identi-
fying drugs with killing activity against both senescent and non-
senescent cells. The killing activity of this panel of drugs was tested
in three RB1-proficient cancer cell lines (SK-MEL-103, NCI-H226,
and the hepatocarcinoma cell line Huh7), under normal proliferating
conditions or rendered senescent with palbociclib (Appendix Fig
S3A–C). We noted that the commonly used cytotoxic drug doxoru-
bicin was among the most efficient cytotoxic drugs against both
normal and senescent cells in the three cancer cell lines used. Based
on this, we generated gal-encapsulated beads loaded with doxoru-
bicin [GalNP(dox)] with the aim of preferentially killing senescent
cells (Appendix Fig S1E). We took advantage of the intrinsic fluores-
cence of doxorubicin to assess its preferential release within senes-
cent cells. Addition of GalNP(dox) to senescent SK-MEL-103 cells
(treated with palbociclib for 14 days) resulted in a strong fluores-
cent signal after 30 min (Fig 3A). In contrast, growing SK-MEL-103
cells showed much weaker fluorescence. As an additional control,
we also used SK-MEL-103 cells treated with palbociclib for only
1 day, which was not sufficient to induce senescence, but efficiently
reduced the levels of phosphorylated RB1 and FOXM1, indicative of
CDK4/CDK6 inhibition (Fig 3A and Appendix Fig S3D). Treatment
of
these
short-term
palbociclib-treated
cells
with
GalNP(dox)
resulted in low levels of fluorescence, similar to those of control
cells (Fig 3A). To further link drug release with senescence, we
performed the same experiment with SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells.
These cells are null for the RB1 gene (Li et al, 1995) and, therefore,
are resistant to palbociclib. Interestingly, treatment of SAOS-2 cells
with GalNP(dox) did not result in doxorubicin release even after
long-term palbociclib treatment (Appendix Fig S3E). It is important
to note that the subcellular localization of doxorubicin fluorescence
was different depending on its formulation: Free doxorubicin local-
ized in the nucleus, whereas encapsulated doxorubicin rendered
perinuclear fluorescence (Fig 3A and Appendix Fig S3E). This rein-
forces the concept that GalNP beads enter cells through endocytosis
and release their cargo in the lysosomal compartment.
It is known that modified forms of doxorubicin with lysosomal
tropism efficiently induce apoptosis (Nair et al, 2015; Sheng et al,
2015). To test whether this was the case in senescent cells treated
with GalNP(dox), we measured by time-lapse fluorescent micro-
scopy the appearance of annexin V-positive cells. Senescent cells
treated with gal-encapsulated doxorubicin underwent cell death
within 48 h, whereas control cells remained viable during this time
(Fig 3B and Appendix Fig S3F).
Based on the above date, we decided to test this strategy in vivo
using gal-encapsulated doxorubicin and also gal-encapsulated navi-
toclax (also known as ABT-263), which is one of the most efficient
senolytic compounds reported to date (Zhu et al, 2016; Chang et al,
2016; Yosef et al, 2016; Pan et al, 2017; Appendix Fig S1E). The first

 therapeutic benefit in combination with palbociclib. In contrast,
GalNP(dox) and GalNP(nav) had no effect on tumor growth when
administered in the absence of palbociclib, demonstrating that their
therapeutic activities require the concomitant induction of senes-
cence by palbociclib (Fig 3C and D; and Appendix Fig S3G and H).
Similar results were obtained with NCI-H226 xenografts treated with
GalNP(dox) (Appendix Fig S3I). As an additional control, we used
empty nanoparticles, GalNP(empty). These empty particles did not
have senolytic activity on in vitro senescent cells (Appendix Fig
S3J), and treatment of mice with GalNP(empty) did not affect the
growth of xenografts and did not improve the growth-inhibitory
effect of palbociclib (Appendix Fig S3J).
A potential beneficial aspect of drug encapsulation is reduced
drug toxicity. Cardiotoxicity is the most serious side effect of
doxorubicin (Chatterjee et al, 2010), whereas thrombocytopenia is
the main toxicity of navitoclax (Kile, 2014). To assess the effect of
gal-encapsulation on the toxicities of doxorubicin and navitoclax,
we selected doses of free and encapsulated drug that were similarly
effective in reducing palbociclib-treated xenografts after daily treat-
ments for ~2 weeks (Fig 3E and F; left panels). For doxorubicin-
treated mice, we measured the mRNA levels of Myh7 and Nppa,
which reflect cardiac hypertrophy in response to doxorubicin-
induced cardiomyocyte death (Barry et al, 2008; Richard et al,
2011). In the case of navitoclax-treated mice, we measured the
levels of serum platelets. Interestingly, gal-encapsulation completely
prevented the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (Fig 3E; right panel).
Also, gal-encapsulation of navitoclax produced a mild reduction in
platelet counts, which was in contrast to the profound and signifi-
cant reduction produced by free navitoclax (Fig 3F; right panel). We
conclude that gal-encapsulation of chemotherapeutic drugs is effec-
tive in clearing senescent cells in vivo, with the added benefit of
reducing the toxicities associated with the drugs.
Therapeutic activity of gal-encapsulated cytotoxic drugs on
pulmonary fibrosis
Based on the above data, we decided to test whether gal-encapsu-
lated doxorubicin could be therapeutic on bleomycin-induced
pulmonary fibrosis. In this disease model, it has been well estab-
lished that treatment with senolytics reduces fibrosis and favors
functional recovery (Pan et al, 2017; Schafer et al, 2017). We first
confirmed that GalNP(dox) efficiently released doxorubicin in lungs
from bleomycin-treated mice, but not in healthy lungs, as deter-
mined by total fluorescence (Appendix Fig S4A). Based on this, we
performed a longitudinal study evaluating the development of the
disease by plethysmography and by computerized tomography (CT)
according to the schedule shown in Fig 4A. Bleomycin was adminis-
tered intratracheally and, when analyzed 10 days later by plethys-
mography, all the mice presented a significant increase in the LR/
Cdyn ratio (LR: lung resistance; Cdyn: compliance dynamics), which
is indicative of pulmonary fibrosis (Fig 4B). Bleomycin-treated mice
were subsequently treated with daily doses of free or gal-encapsu-
lated doxorubicin (1 mg/kg) for ~2 weeks. Importantly, at the end
of the treatment, mice treated with GalNP(dox), but not with free
doxorubicin, presented LR/Cdyn values similar to those of healthy
controls (Fig 4B and Appendix Fig S4B). These data were confirmed
by computerized tomography, which indicated a significant reduc-
tion in the lung volume affected by inflammation and fibrosis in
GalNP(dox)-treated mice (Fig 4C and D and Appendix Fig S4C).
Histological analysis of the bleomycin-treated lungs showed charac-
teristic features of lung fibrosis, namely focal areas of high cellular-
ity with interstitial collagen deposits (stained with Sirius red;
Fig 4E). Similar lesions were observed in mice treated with free
doxorubicin (Fig 4E). In contrast, mice treated with gal-encapsu-
lated doxorubicin for ~2 weeks presented a significant collagen
reduction in the damaged areas of bleomycin-treated lungs (Fig 4E).
No evidence of hepatic or renal damage was observed in any of the
groups, as evaluated by serum markers and histology (Appendix Fig
S4D and E).
Discussion
In recent years, it has become evident that multiple diseases are
associated with the presence of senescent cells and that the elimi-
nation of these cells has therapeutic benefits in mouse models
(Childs et al, 2017; Soto-Gamez & Demaria, 2017). Here, we report
a versatile vehicle to deliver small therapeutic compounds to
senescent lesions in vivo. We show that gal-encapsulated cytotoxic
drugs are therapeutic against tumors treated with senescence-indu-
cing
chemotherapy
and
against
bleomycin-induced
pulmonary
fibrosis.

C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to a single intratracheal administration of bleomycin at 1.5 U/kg BW. Beginning at day 10, mice were treated daily with free
doxorubicin (tail vein injection, 1 mg/kg) or with GalNP(dox) (tail vein injection, 200 ll of a solution with 4 mg/ml of GalNP containing a total of 1 mg/kg of
deliverable doxorubicin), for 18 days, that is, until day 28 post-bleomycin. Plethysmography and CT were performed at the indicated days.

Drug delivery into senescent cells

 Gal-encapsulation is based on the high levels of lysosomal b-
galactosidase activity present in many senescent cells (abbreviated
as SAbGal). Although SAbGal is not a perfect marker of senescence,
damaged or diseased tissues are in general positive for this marker
(Sharpless & Sherr, 2015). Gal-encapsulation consists on spherical
particles (100 nm diameter) of porous silica loaded with the chosen
therapeutic cargo and then coated with galacto-oligosaccharides that
prevent the diffusion of the cargo out of the silica matrix (Agostini
et al, 2012). Using this approach, we previously generated gal-
encapsulated rhodamine and we showed preferential release of
rhodamine
in
progeric
fibroblasts
(dyskeratosis
congenita)
compared to healthy fibroblasts (Agostini et al, 2012). We show
here that this is also the case for human cancer cell lines (me-
lanoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and head and neck squa-
mous cell carcinoma) responsive to palbociclib. This compound is a
CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor that efficiently induces senescence in respon-
sive cancer cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that gal-encapsulated
rhodamine, abbreviated GalNP(rho), preferentially releases rhoda-
mine within senescent lesions in vivo. In particular, we demonstrate
this in palbociclib-treated tumor xenografts and in lungs damaged
with bleomycin. When we used a different fluorescent cargo, indo-
cyanine green, we also observed preferential release in palbociclib-
treated tumors.
We have used bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis to investigate
which cell types are labeled with rhodamine after in vivo treat-
ment with GalNP(rho). Flow cytometry analysis has revealed that
lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts are preferentially labeled with
rhodamine upon GalNP(rho) injection in bleomycin-treated lungs
compared to control lungs. Interestingly, the RNAseq profile of
these cells was enriched in signatures of senescence. Cargo release
by GalNP(rho) was also observed in lung macrophages, both in
control and bleomycin-treated lungs. In this regard, it is relevant
to mention that macrophages are known to metabolize nanoparti-
cles (Wilhelm et al, 2016) and can present SAbGal activity without
actually being senescent (Hall et al, 2017). Future analyses should
determine how gal-encapsulated drugs affect macrophage popula-
tions.
To test the therapeutic potential of our encapsulation method,
we first screened a panel of 80 chemotherapeutic agents and we
found that doxorubicin was among the most potent agents killing
both senescent and non-senescent cells. In this regard, it is impor-
tant to point out that doxorubicin kills cells through multiple mecha-
nisms, many of which are not related to cell division (Gewirtz,
1999). In addition, doxorubicin has intrinsic fluorescence thus
allowing to track its delivery. Based on this, we generated gal-encap-
sulated doxorubicin, or GalNP(dox), and we determined its delivery
in cultured cells. As it was the case for rhodamine, gal-encapsulated
doxorubicin was more efficiently released in senescent cells than in
control cells. Moreover, this preferential release of doxorubicin by
GalNP(dox) resulted in higher levels of apoptosis in senescent cells.
Interestingly, we noted that soon after addition of GalNP(dox) to
senescent cells, doxorubicin was confined to a perinuclear compart-
ment. This is consistent with the expected route of entry of the
nanoparticles via endocytosis. Previous investigators working with
conjugated forms of doxorubicin have observed that delivery of
doxorubicin into lysosomes is very efficient in inducing apoptosis
(Nair et al, 2015; Sheng et al, 2015). In contrast to the perinuclear
localization of encapsulated doxorubicin, administration of the free
form of the drug resulted in nuclear localization in all cells, senes-
cent or non-senescent. These observations support the use of
GalNPs as a vehicle to deliver doxorubicin to senescent cells and to
induce their apoptotic death.
After validating the use of GalNP(dox) with senescent cultured
cells, we focused on the two experimental models mentioned above,
namely, bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and palbociclib-induced
tumor senescence. Upon administration of GalNP(dox), doxoru-
bicin-derived fluorescence was higher in bleomycin-treated lungs
compared to control lungs. Bleomycin-damaged mice were daily
treated with intravenous administration of GalNP(dox) or free
doxorubucin, from day 10 to day 28 post-bleomycin. Importantly,
gal-encapsulated doxorubicin significantly improved lung elasticity,
as evaluated by plethysmography, while free doxorubicin did not
restore lung function. These observations were further supported by
the quantification of fibrosis by computerized tomography and by
histology.
In addition, GalNP(dox) showed tumor-regressing activity in
combination with palbociclib when administered to mice carrying
tumor xenografts (SK-MEL-103 melanoma, and H226 lung squa-
mous cell carcinoma). This was also the case when we used encap-
sulated navitoclax, a well-established senolytic drug. It is important
to note that GalNP(dox) or GalNP(nav) had no effect in the absence
of palbociclib, that is, were effective against senescent tumors but
not on growing tumors. Also, empty nanoparticles, GalNP(empty),
had no effect on tumor size, either alone or in combination with
palbociclib. These observations reinforce the concept that gal-encap-
sulation is a useful vehicle to deliver therapeutic drugs into senes-
cent tumor cells, but not into non-senescent tumor cells. The
elimination of senescent tumor cells by GalNP-mediated senolysis
may also affect tumor growth by reducing the SASP and its potential
pro-tumorigenic effects. Moreover, the delivery of drugs into senes-
cent cells may have a local bystander effect on neighboring cells
and this may enhance its therapeutic effects.
As it is the case of many drugs, doxorubicin and navitoclax
present toxicities, which limit their clinical use. The encapsulation
of these agents in GalNPs may reduce the exposure of healthy
tissues to the drugs and, thereby, diminish undesired effects. In
support of this, we have observed that gal-encapsulation reduced
the carditoxicity of doxorubicin and the thrombocytopenia charac-
teristic of navitoclax.
Besides the therapeutic potential of gal-encapsulation for senes-
cence-related diseases, our vehicle can be of use for the detection of
senescence by in vivo imaging. In our work, the encapsulation of
fluorophores has allowed us to detect lung tissue regions with
senescent cells and palbociclib-responsive tumors. This opens up
the possibility of encapsulating tracers and contrast agents for
biomedical imaging of senescent areas that could be of use in multi-
ple age-related disorders. For example, diagnostic GalNPs could
release gadolinium or positron-emitting radioisotopes in senescent
lesions to be detected by MRI or PET, respectively. Gal-encapsula-
tion could also serve to evaluate the response of solid tumors to the
administration of senescence-inducing chemotherapies or radiother-
apies. In addition, cellular senescence is a defining feature of a wide
variety of premalignant lesions both in humans and in mice (Col-
lado & Serrano, 2010). Based on this, it is tempting to speculate that
GalNPs could also be used for the diagnosis of precancerous tumors.
Even more, GalNPs could be potentially employed as a novel

 theranostic tool, aimed to simultaneously detect and eradicate
senescent lesions associated with numerous pathologies, or during
aging.
In summary, we contribute a versatile strategy to deliver essen-
tially any small compound to senescent lesions in vivo. This novel
therapeutic tool can be used to eradicate senescent cells and could be
employed in clinical imaging. As a proof of principle, we show that
gal-encapsulated cytotoxic drugs are therapeutically efficient against
tumors treated with senescence-inducing chemotherapy and against
pulmonary fibrosis. Finally, and equally important, gal-encapsula-
tion reduces the systemic toxicities of chemotherapeutic drugs.
Materials and Methods
Synthesis of GalNP beads
For the synthesis of the mesoporous silica MCM-41 scaffolds (Kresge
et al, 1992), N-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Sigma,
#H6269) was first dissolved in 480 ml of deionized water at
2.74 mM. Then, 3.5 ml of NaOH 2 M (Sigma, #1310732) was added
to the CTAB solution, and temperature was adjusted to 80°C. Next,
5 ml of the polymeric precursor tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS,
Sigma, #131903) was added dropwise to the surfactant solution.
The mixture was stirred for 2 h at 80°C, obtaining a white precipi-
tate, referred to as “solid product”. The solid product was centri-
fuged 13,000 g for 20 min and washed with deionized water until
reaching a neutral pH, and dried at 60°C, referred to as “NPs as
synthesized” (NPs standing for nanoparticles). To obtain the final
template-free NP scaffolds, the “NPs as synthesized” were calcined
at 550°C using an oxidant atmosphere for 5 h to remove the CTAB
template, thus eliminating any residual surfactant that might affect
cell viability, obtaining the “NP scaffolds”.
Loading of the NP scaffolds with the different compounds was
performed as follows: For NP(rho), 200 mg of NPs were suspended
in a solution of 16 ml of EtOH together with 76.65 mg of rhodamine
B (Sigma, #R6226); for NP(icg), 200 mg of mesoporous silica
nanoparticles (MSNs) were suspended in a solution of 5 ml of water
together with 5 mg of indocyanine green (Sigma, #I2633); for NP
(dox), 200 mg of MSNs were suspended in a solution of 12.5 ml of
water
together
with
110 mg
of
doxorubicin
(Carbosynth,
#AD15377); for NP(nav), 250 mg of NPs were suspended in 27 ml
EtOH together with 91.3 mg of navitoclax (Active BioChem, #A-
1001). These solutions were stirred in round-bottom flasks for 24 h
at room temperature, and solids were isolated by centrifugation at
13,000 g for 15 min and dried at 37°C. We refer to these products as
“loaded NPs”.
For coating with galacto-hexasaccharides, the “loaded NPs” were
suspended in 7.5 ml of dichloromethane, and 280 ll of 3-aminopro-
pyltriethoxysilane (APTES, Sigma, #440140) were added to the reac-
tion mixture. After stirring for 5.5 h, solids were isolated by
centrifugation at 13,000 g for 15 min and dried at 37°C. The
obtained solids were suspended in 24 ml of water and 383 mg of
Galactan (Carbosynth, #OG71532), mostly (≥ 80%) consisting of six
repeating galactose monosaccharides linked through b-1,4 glycosidic
bonds. Stirring was continued at room temperature for 21 h. The
final product, referred to as GalNP(cargo), was obtained after
several washes with water (cycles of centrifugation at 13,000 g for
15 min and suspension in water), followed by drying at 37°C. The
GalNP(cargo) were stored in a desiccator at room temperature.
In a few cases, a mixture of b(1,4)-galacto-oligosaccharides (Gos)
of different lengths (mostly dimers and trimmers) was used to coat
the “loaded NPs”, as previously reported (Agostini et al, 2012).
Briefly, 600 mg of galacto-oligosaccharide derivative (Gos-d) were
dissolved in 20 ml of EtOH and added to the “loaded NPs”. The
suspension was stirred for 5.5 h at room temperature. The final solids
were obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 15 min and were
washed several times with water to eliminate non-anchored mole-
cules and non-loaded dye. Finally, solids were dried at 37°C to obtain
the final Gos-coated loaded NPs, abbreviated as GosNP(cargo).
Characterization of GalNP beads
To characterize the nanomaterials, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD),
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), elemental analysis (EA), trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption-desorption, and
UV-visible spectroscopy techniques were used. The following equip-
ment was used: X-ray measurements were performed on a Bruker
AXS D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu-Ka radiation. Thermo-
gravimetric analyses were carried out on a TGA/SDTA 851e Mettler
Toledo equipment, using an oxidant atmosphere (Air, 80 ml/min)
with a heating program consisting on a heating rate of 10°C/min
from 393 K to 1,273 K and an isothermal heating step at this
temperature for 30 min. TEM images were taken with a Philips
CM10 microscope working at 100 kV. N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms were recorded on a Micromeritics ASAP2010 automated
sorption analyzer. The samples were degassed at 120°C under
vacuum overnight. The specific surface areas were calculated from
the adsorption data in the low pressures range using the BET model.
Pore size was determined by following the BJH method. UV-visible
spectroscopy was carried out with a Lambda 35 UV/vis spectrome-
ter (Perkin-Elmer Instruments), and fluorescence spectroscopy was
performed with a JASCO spectrofluorometer FP-8300.
Cargo release studies
For cargo release studies, 2 mg of GosNP(rho), GosNP(icg), GalNP
(rho), GalNP(dox), or GalNP(nav) nanoparticles were suspended in
5 ml of water at pH 4.5, and b-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae
(Sigma, #G5160) was added at 1,000 ppm (5 mg). Suspensions were
stirred, and different aliquots were taken and centrifuged at different
time points. The amount of cargo released was determined in a
JASCO spectrofluorometer FP-8300 by monitoring the emission (for
rho, icg, dox) or the absorption (for nav) of the dye or drug in the
aqueous solution, as a function of time (rho kex = 550 nm, rho
kem = 580 nm;
icg
kex = 775 nm,
icg
kem = 799 nm;
dox
kex = 495 nm, dox kem = 556 nm; nav kem = 356 nm). The same
procedure was performed without adding the enzyme to the
nanoparticles suspension, as a “blank” control.

 carcinoma) were kindly provided by Dr. Reidar Grenman (Turku
University, Finland). All cell lines were maintained in DMEM, except
for NCI-H226 that were maintained in RPMI, and supplemented with
10% FBS and penicillin–streptomycin (all from Gibco), and incubated
in 20% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37°C. Cells were routinely tested for myco-
plasma contamination using the mycoplasma tissue culture NI (MTC-
NI) Rapid Detection System (Gen-Probe). For senescence induction,
cells
were
supplemented
with
media
containing
palbociclib
(PD033299, Pfizer Inc.) at 1 or 5 lM, as indicated in the figure
legends.
Cargo release analysis by confocal microscopy
For GalNP(rho) cargo release imaging assays, cells were trypsinized
and replated in flat-bottom l-clear 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One,
#655087). SK-MEL-103 cells were seeded at a density of 6,000
control and 4,000 senescent cells per well. NCI-H226 and UT-SCC-
42B cells were plated at a density of 6,000–9,000 control and
10,000–12,000 senescent cells per well. Once cells were attached,
culture medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 0.1%
FBS. Three days later, cells were exposed to GalNP(rho) or to GalNP
(dox) nanoparticles. The GalNP(rho) and GalNP(dox) were added at
a final concentration of ~50 lg/ml in 0.1% FBS-supplemented
DMEM. For cytoplasm and nuclei staining, the cells were incubated
for 30 min with 0.05 lM Calcein AM (Mol Probes #C3099) and
4 lM Hoechst (ThermoFisher Scientific, #3342).
For GalNP(dox) cargo release imaging assays, cells were trypsi-
nized and replated in flat-bottom l-clear 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-
One, #655087). SK-MEL-103 cells were seeded at a density of 6,000
control and 4,000 senescent cells per well. Next day, cells were
exposed to GalNP(dox) nanoparticles at a concentration of 1 mg/ml
in 10% FBS-supplemented DMEM, previously filtered through a
0.45-lm syringe filter, for 30 min at 37°C. Then, cells were washed
with DMEM and fixed for 10 min with 4% PFA, then washed with
PBS and mounted in 30% glycerol.
For cargo release imaging in lung cells, control and bleomycin-
treated mice were tail vein injected with 200 ll of a solution
containing GalNP(rho) at 4 mg/ml in DMEM. Mice were sacrificed
6 h post-injection, and lungs were placed in a cryomold containing
OCT (Leica Biosystems) and frozen in dry ice for 30 min. Frozen
OCT
sections
were
washed
in
PBS
and
fixed
in
fresh
4%
paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Coverslips were
mounted by using Vectashield Mounting Medium supplemented
with 1.5 mg/ml DAPI prior to imaging.
Images were acquired on a TCS-SP5 (AOBS) laser scanning
confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) using a 20× HCX PL APO
0.7 NA dry objective or a 40× HCX PL APO 1.2 NA oil immersion
objective. Rhodamine B was detected by using excitation wave-
length of 561 nm (DPSS laser) and with a detection window
between 570 and 590 nm. Doxorubicin was detected by using exci-
tation wavelength of 488 nm (argon laser) and with a detection
window between 545 and 605 nm. Cells without GalNPs treatments
were used in parallel as autofluorescence controls using the corre-
sponding
excitation
and
detection
wavelenghts.
Images
were
analyzed with LAS AF v2.6 acquisition software equipped with
HCS-A module (Leica Microsystems). Rhodamine B intensity rela-
tive to cell surface was quantified with Definiens XD Developer v2.5
software (Definiens).
Drug screening assay
For drug screening assays, cells were trypsinized and replated in
flat-bottom l-clear 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, #655087).
Control and senescent SK-MEL-103 cells were plated at a density of
6,000 and 4,000 cells per well, respectively. Control and senescent
Huh7 or NCI-H226 cells were plated at a density of 7,000 and 15,000
cells per well, respectively. 24 h later, the chemicals from a panel of
80 drugs currently used for the treatment of cancer or in cancer clin-
ical trials were added individually to the cells at a 5 lM final
concentration. After 72 h, the cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst
(ThermoFisher Scientific, #3342) at 4 lM and dead cells were
stained with TO-PRO-3 Iodide (Molecular Probes #T3605) at 1 lM.
To assess the number of viable cells, 20 pictures were taken per
individual well using an Opera HCS system (Pelkin Elmer) with a
10× objective. Hoechst was detected using excitation wavelength of
360 nm (UV lamp), and TO-PRO-3 Iodide was detected using excita-
tion wavelength of 640 nm. Nuclei were analyzed and quantified
with Acapella v2.0 software (Perkin Elmer). The data from each
single well were averaged, and the number of viable cells was
obtained by subtracting the number of TO-PRO-3 Iodide positive
cells (dead cells) from the number of Hoechst-positive cells (total
cells). The number of viable cells was normalized to the internal
control of untreated cells (DMSO only) of each plate.
Apoptosis assay
For the apoptosis assays, annexin V signal was measured with the
IncuCyte Live-Cell Analysis System (Essen BioScience). Briefly,
senescent SK-MEL-103 cells (treated with 5 lM palbociclib for
2 weeks) and control SK-MEL-103 cells were seeded in flat-bottom
l-clear 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, #655087) in DMEM + 2%
FBS. Annexin V Green Reagent for Apoptosis (Cat #4642) was added
to the cells. Two hours later, GalNP(dox) was added at a concentra-
tion of 0.06 mg/ml, previously filtered through a 0.45-lm syringe
filter. Images were captured over time. Cells with positive signal for
annexin V were quantified in triplicates and normalized by the total
number of cells per corresponding field.
Immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections
Tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (4%
formaldehyde in solution), paraffin-embedded, and cut into 3-mm
sections, which were mounted and dried. For different staining
methods, slides were deparaffinized in xylene and re-hydrated
through a series of graded EtOH until water. Masson’s trichrome
and Sirius red stainings were used to assess the presence of fibrotic
areas in the lungs, as indicated. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain-
ing was used to analyze liver damage, as indicated. For immunohis-
tochemistry, an automated immunostaining platform was used
(Ventana
discovery

Roche).
Antigen
retrieval
was
first
performed with high pH buffer (CC1m, Roche), endogenous peroxi-
dase was blocked, and slides were then incubated with the appropri-
ate primary antibodies as detailed: Ki67 (Master Diagnostica,
#0003110QD), phosphorylated Rb (Ser807/811) (Cell Signalling
Technology, #9308). After incubations with the primary antibody,

 conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Chromomap, Ventana,
Roche). Immunohistochemical reactions were developed by using
3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) as a chromogen,
and nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, the slides
were dehydrated, cleared, and mounted with a permanent mounting
medium for microscopic evaluation.
Animal models
All mice were maintained at the Spanish National Cancer Research
Centre (CNIO) under specific pathogen-free conditions in accor-
dance with the recommendations of the Federation of European
Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA). Mice were
housed in ventilated racks with integration of Individually Venti-
lated Caging (IVC) units in the building ventilation systems. All
animal experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee for
Research and Animal Welfare (CEIyBA) and performed in accor-
dance with the guidelines stated in the International Guiding Princi-
ples for Biomedical Research Involving Animals, developed by the
Council
for
International
Organizations
of
Medical
Sciences
(CIOMS).
Xenograft formation
Tumor xenografts were established using SK-MEL-103 or NCI-H226
cell lines. Cells were trypsinized, counted with a haemocytometer,
and injected subcutaneously (106 cells in a volume of 100 ll per
dorsolateral flank) in 8- to 10-week-old athymic nude female mice
(Hsd:Athymic
Nude-Foxn1nu)
purchased
from
Envigo.
Tumor
volume was measured every 2 days with a caliper and calculated as
V = (a × b2)/2 where a is the longer and b is the shorter of two
perpendicular diameters.
Fibrosis
To induce pulmonary fibrosis, 8- to 10-week-old male C57BL/6
wild-type mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with a
mix containing ketamine (75 mg/kg) and medetomidine (1 mg/kg).
The animals were placed on a Tilting WorkStand for rodents (EMC
Hallowell) and intubated intratracheally with a 24GA catheter (BD
Biosciences). Then, bleomycin (Sigma, #15361) was intratracheally
inoculated in at 1.5 U/kg of body weight. Serial sections of the lung
were stained with Sirius red to assess the presence of collagen.
Whole slides were digitalized with a slide scanner (Mirax Scan,
Zeiss) using polarized light, and images were acquired with the
Pannoramic Viewer Software (3DHISTECH). Image analysis and
quantification of colored signals (red, yellow, and green) within
damaged areas was performed in a completely automated manner
using the AxioVision software package (Zeiss). At least seven mice
per group were quantified.
Mouse treatments
In vitro experimental calculations indicated that approximately
~30 mg of drug, both doxorubicin and navitoclax, are deliverable
per g of GalNPs (see Appendix Table S3). GalNPs were weighted in
8 ml Wheaton glass vials (Sigma, Z256161) at 4 mg/ml in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and stirred with a magnetic stir bar for
1 h. Mice were i.v. injected as indicated, with 200 ll of a nanoparti-
cle solution containing 4 mg/ml (equivalent to 1 mg/kg of deliver-
able drug). Doxorubicin (Sigma, #D1515) was dissolved in 7%
saline/DMEM solution at 1 mg/kg and administered by daily i.v.
(tail vein) injection as indicated. Navitoclax, also known as ABT263
(Active Biochem, #A-100), was administered by daily oral gavage,
for 13 days, at 25 mg/kg, dissolved in 15% DMSO/PEG400. Palboci-
clib (Pfizer Inc.) was dissolved in 50 mM sodium lactate at
12.5 mg/ml and administered by daily oral gavage at the indicated
doses. Palbociclib treatment started 1 day before GalNPs or free
drugs administration.
Flow cytometry
Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with a mix
containing ketamine (75 mg/kg) and medetomidine (1 mg/kg).
Mouse lungs were intracardially perfused with 20 ml ice-cold PBS,
removed, and intratracheally inoculated with 2 ml of 5 U/ml
dispase (Corning). After 10-min incubation at 37°C, lungs were cut
into small pieces with surgical blades (Braun) and transferred to
GentleMacs M Tubes (Miltenyi) containing 7 ml HBSS, 1% FBS,
20 U/ml DNase I (Promega), and 70 U/ml collagenase I (Gibco).
Samples were homogenized in a GentleMacs Dissociator (Miltenyi)
using the “mouse lung 01” program, incubated for 30 min at 37°C
under shaking, and re-homogenized with the “mouse lung 02”
GentleMacs Dissociator program. The homogenized mixture was
subsequently filtered through 70 and 40 nm cell strainers (BD Bios-
ciences) and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. The cell pellet was
resuspended in 2 ml erythrocyte lysis buffer (Qiagen) for 4 min at
RT for red blood cell lysis. Cells were then resuspended in 13 ml
DMEM + 10% FBS. Cells were counted and viability was assessed
using trypan blue (Sigma) in an automated cell counter Countess
(Molecular Probes), and resuspended at 107 cells/ml in HBSS + 2%
FBS containing 10 mM HEPES buffer (Gibco). The following rat
monoclonal conjugated antibodies
were used: anti-CD31 APC
(1:400, BD Biosciences; #551260), anti-CD45 APC (1:200, BD Bios-
ciences, #559864), anti-CD326 (EpCAM) AF488 (1:200, Biolegend,
#118210), anti-CD45.2 APC-Cy7 (1:100, Biolegend, #109824), anti-
F4/80 BV421 (1:50, Biolegend, 123131), anti-CD11b PE-Cy7 (1:200,
BD Biosciences #552850). DAPI (Sigma) or forward and side scatter
(FSC/SSC) was used for live/dead discrimination. All samples were
acquired and sorted using an InFlux (BD) equipped with 640, 561,
488 and 355 nm lines. OneComp Beads (eBioscience) were used as
compensation controls to assess and correct spectral overlapping.
Population gating was performed using fluorescence minus one
(FMO) controls (Appendix Fig S2C, E and F). Pulse processing was
used to exclude cell aggregates, and at least 50,000 events were
collected for analysis.
RNAseq
Total RNA from flow-sorted lung cells was extracted with an
RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, #74106). ~2 ng of total RNA samples
(range 0.4–5 ng) was processed with the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low
Input RNA Kit (Clontech) by following manufacturer instructions.
Resulting cDNA was sheared on a S220 Focused-ultrasonicator
(Covaris) and subsequently processed with the “NEBNext Ultra II
DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina” (NEB #E7645). Briefly, oligo

 (dT)-primed reverse transcription was performed in the presence of
a template switching oligonucleotide; double-stranded cDNA was
then produced by 14 cycles of PCR and submitted to acoustic shear-
ing. Fragments were processed through subsequent enzymatic treat-
ments of end-repair, dA-tailing, and ligation to Illumina adapters.
Adapter-ligated libraries were completed by limited-cycle PCR (eight
cycles). The resulting purified cDNA libraries were applied to an
Illumina flow cell for cluster generation and sequenced on an Illu-
mina HiSeq2500 by following manufacturer’s protocols. Image anal-
ysis, per-cycle basecalling, and quality score assignment were
performed with Illumina Real Time Analysis software. Conversion
of Illumina BCL files to bam format was performed with the Illumi-
na2bam tool (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute—NPG). Sequencing
quality was analyzed with FastQC; reads were aligned to the mouse
genome (GRCm38/mm10) using TopHat-2.0.10 (Trapnell et al,
2012), Bowtie 1.0.0 (Langmead et al, 2009) and Samtools 0.1.19.0
(Li et al, 2009); and transcripts assembly, abundances estimation,
and differential expression were calculated with DESeq2 (Love et al,
2014). The estimated significance level (P-value) was corrected to

cantly enriched at a FDR q-values < 0.25 were considered.
Analysis of mRNA levels
For lung samples, total RNA from flow-sorted lung cells was
extracted with an RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, #74106). For heart
samples, total RNA was isolated by acid guanidinium thiocyanate–
phenol–chloroform extraction. Up to 4 lg of total RNA was reverse
transcribed into cDNA using iScriptTM Advanced cDNA Synthesis
Kit for RT–qPCR (Bio-Rad #172-5038). For qRT–PCR, each cDNA
sample was assayed in triplicate reactions in optical-grade, 386-well
plates (Applied Biosystems). Each reaction contained 6 ll of Sybr-
Green (2×) (Applied Biosystems), 2 ll of cDNA template, 3.4 ll of
DNase-free water, and 0.6 ll of primers (10 lM f.c.). All PCR runs
were performed on a QuantStudio
TM 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System
using QuantStudio
TM 6 and 7 Flex Real-Time PCR software v1.0
(Applied Biosystems). Reaction conditions were as follows: 10 min
at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C, and
1 min at 62°C. The housekeeping genes Actb and/or Gapdh were
used for input normalization, as indicated.

Western blot
Cells were harvested after treatment with the indicated compounds
in NET buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8, 2 mM EDTA, 1%
Triton, 0.1% FBS). Identical amounts of whole lysates (30 lg)
together with a Chameleon
TM Duo pre-stained protein ladder (LI-

the corresponding secondary anti-IgG antibodies anti-rabbit IRDye
680 CW (1:15,000, LI-COR, #926-68071), anti-rabbit IRDye 800 CW
(1:15,000, LI-COR, #926-32211), and anti-goat IRDye 680 CW
(1:10,000, LI-COR, #926-68074) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots
were analyzed with an Odyssey Fc imaging system (LI-COR).
SAbGal activity assay
SAbGal staining was performed in cells, whole tissues (either lungs
or tumor xenografts) or in tissue cryosections (either lungs or tumor
xenografts) preserved in OCT using the Senescence b-Galactosidase
Staining Kit (Cell Signaling). In cells, SAbGal staining was performed
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, whole tissues or
tissue cryosections were fixed at room temperature, for 45 min or
2 min, respectively, with a solution containing 2% formaldehyde
and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS, washed three times with PBS, and
incubated overnight at 37°C with the Staining Solution containing X-
gal in N-N-dimethylformamide (pH 6.0). In the case of whole tissue
staining, tissues were subsequently dehydrated with two consecu-
tive steps in 50 and 70% EtOH and embedded in paraffin for serial
sectioning. Sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red (NFR)
or were processed for immunohistochemistry.
Lung in vivo imaging by CT
The acquisition was made on a CT Locus high-resolution computed
tomography system (GE Healthcare) specifically designed for small
laboratory animals and with an isotropic resolution of 45 lm. Mice
were anesthetized with a 4% rate of isoflurane (IsoVet Braun)
during the induction, and 2% during the maintenance period (scan-
ning time). Micro-CT image acquisition consisted of 400 projections
collected in one full rotation of the gantry during ~10 min in a single
stage focused on the lungs, with a 450-mA/80-kV X-ray tube. The
resulting raw data were reconstructed to a final image volume of
875 × 875 × 465 slices at (93 lm) 3 voxel dimensions. CT images
were analyzed with Microview 2.2 software (GE Healthcare). To
measure the volume of the fibrotic areas, a region of interest (ROI)
was drawn manually over the lung “slice by slice” on the areas that
showed abnormal increase of density corresponding to fibrotic
tissue. Finally, a three-dimensional ROI was generated providing the
fibrotic volume. Image analysis quantification was performed by an

 independent and well-trained technician in a blinded manner. 3D
isocontour-based volume rendering was performed using AMIDE
software. All procedures were carried out according to the European
Normative of Welfare and Good Practice (2010/63/UE).
Plethysmography
Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with a mix
containing ketamine (75 mg/kg) and medetomidine (1 mg/kg).
Animals were placed on a Tilting WorkStand for rodents (EMC
Hallowell) and intubated intratracheally with a 24GA catheter (BD
Biosciences). Then, animals were placed in a plethysmograph
adapted for anesthetized rodents (emka TECHNOLOGIES). A Mini-
Vent Model 845 (Harvard Apparatus) connected to the plethysmo-
graph was used to ventilate the mice at a frequency of 150 beats/
min and 10 ml/kg of tidal volume. Transpulmonary pressure was
measured with a pressure transducer connected to the cannula. Air-
flow and tidal volume were determined using a flow transducer
fixed to the plethysmograph chamber. Lung resistance (LR) and
compliance dynamics (Cdyn) were calculated and analyzed with
iox2 software (emka TECHNOLOGIES).
In vivo and ex vivo imaging by IVIS
An IVIS Spectrum Imaging System (Perkin Elmer Inc) was used for
in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging. For in vivo imaging, mice
were anesthetized with a 4% rate of isoflurane (IsoVet Braun) during
the induction, and 2% during the maintenance period (scanning
time). For ex vivo imaging, mice were sacrificed by CO2 exposure in
a euthanasia chamber, and organs and tumor xenografts were
analyzed immediately after harvesting. Rhodamine B was detected
using excitation wavelength of 535 nm and emission wavelength of
580 nm. Indocyanine green was detected using excitation passband
of 710–760 nm and emission passband of 810–875 nm. Doxorubicin
was detected using excitation wavelength of 430 nm and emission
wavelength of 600 nm. Fluorescence imaging quantification was
performed by Living Image 3.2 software (Perkin Elmer Inc). A region
of interest area (ROI) was drawn over the fluorescent signal either in
lung or xenograft tumor samples in order to quantify the release of
the fluorophores. Fluorescence activity is measured in photons per
second per square centimeter per steradian (p/s/cm2/sr).
Blood analysis
Blood samples were obtained by sub-mandibular blood extraction
and collected in EDTA-coated tubes (Aquisel). Platelet counts were
measured with an Automated Blood Cell counter (Abbacus). For
hepatic and renal function assessment, blood samples were centri-
fuged at 1,700 g for 5 min, and the serum (supernatant) was
removed. Serum samples were added at a volume of 50 ll into VetS-
can� Mammalian Liver Profile reagent rotors (Abaxis, #500-1040).
Hepatic and renal profiles were assessed by analysis of the rotors
with a VetScan� Chemistry Analyzer (Abaxis).
Silica biodistribution
Mice were sacrificed 6 h post-GalNP(rho) injection, and selected
organs were extracted (lung, liver, spleen, bladder, kidney, heart,
gut, and tail) for Si detection. The extracted organs were first
weighed and then digested with 1 ml of tetramethylammonium
hydroxide solution 25% in H2O (TMHA, Sigma, #75592). Digestion
was carried out in closed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vessels for
2 h at 80°C, using a digestion unit Bloc digest 20 (Selecta). After
cooling, digested samples were diluted to 10 ml in polypropylene
Erlenmeyer flasks (in order to avoid Si contamination) and kept in
polystyrene tubes. For the analysis, 0.5 ml of the digested samples
was diluted to 10 ml with a solution of 2% nitric acid and 1%
hydrochloric acid. Standard solutions were prepared from silicon
standard (1,000 mg/l Si in NaOH, Sigma #08729) for Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and were digested
and treated exactly the same way as the samples. Samples were
analyzed with an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer
System (ICP-MS) Agilent 7900. Results were calculated using the
calibration with digested standard solutions. Data are expressed as
lg Si/g sample.
The paper explained
Problem
Senescence is a cellular program that is triggered by multiple types of
damage. Senescent cells are present in many diseases and accumulate
in multiple tissues during aging, thereby participating actively in
tissue deterioration. A major goal in this area is to find ways to elimi-
nate senescent cells within tissues. Senescent cells share a number of
features, including a very low or inexistent capacity to proliferate, and
a robust secretion of extracellular factors that can severely modify the
microenvironment. The active secretory machinery of senescent cells
is associated with a high abundance of lysosomes, and thereby, senes-
cent cells are characterized by high levels of lysosomal b-galactosi-
dase activity. We have used this trait to deliver drugs preferentially
into senescent cells.
Results
We have designed a drug encapsulation system that uses galacto-
oligosaccharides to coat a silica scaffold containing the drug of inter-
est. The release of gal-encapsulated drugs requires digestion by the
lysosomal b-galactosidase. Senescent cells are more efficient than
non-senescent cells in digesting and releasing gal-encapsulated drugs.
We
demonstrate
that
gal-encapsulated
drugs
are
preferentially
released into damaged tissues containing senescent cells, such as
bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. The release of gal-encapsulated
doxorubicin into fibrotic lungs results in a remarkable reduction of
fibrosis and in recovery of respiratory function. In contrast, free
doxorubicin does not ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis. In the case of
xenograft tumors, treatment with chemotherapy often triggers senes-
cence in tumor cells, as it is the case of palbociclib. Co-treatment of
tumors with palbociclib and gal-encapsulated drugs results in a more
efficient
tumor
regression.
Gal-encapsulation
has
the
additional
advantage of reducing the exposure of non-target organs to the
drugs.
Impact
This study presents proof of principle for the biological activity of a
versatile encapsulation method that allows to deliver drugs preferen-
tially in diseased tissues containing senescent cells. This may open
new therapeutic opportunities for severe diseases, such as pulmonary
fibrosis. The delivery of drugs into senescent cells may also improve
cancer chemotherapy by eliminating chemotherapy-induced senescent
cells. Finally, it may have applications in the diagnosis of senescence-
associated diseases.

 Statistical methods
In cell culture experiments, at least three independent replicates were
assayed to ensure reproducibility. In animal experiments, sample
sizes for comparisons between treatments followed Mead’s recom-
mendations (Festing et al, 2002). In particular, the accumulated n
value (N) for a given comparison minus the number of groups or
treatments (T) was between 10 and 20 in most of the experiments, as
recommended. In the case of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis
experiments, the n value was higher due to the intrinsically high
variability of the assay. For in vivo studies, mice were excluded
following pre-established criteria if they developed humane-interven-
tion end-point complications in the course of the study. All mice
were age and weight matched. No additional randomization was
used for animal studies. For cell culture fluorescence analysis, quan-
tifications were performed in a blinded manner. For plethysmogra-
phy measurements and CT analysis, the evaluators were also blind
to the treatments. For the xenograft assays, investigators were not
blinded to the experimental groups. Statistical tests were performed
only on experiments with at least three replicates. Statistical signifi-
cance was assessed as appropriate using either the Student’s t-test
(two-tailed, paired or unpaired), the Fisher exact test, or the one-way
ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test,
as indicated in the figure legends. Data were tested for normal distri-
bution using the Shapiro–Wilk test and for equal variance using the
F-test. Normal distribution and equal variance was confirmed in the
large majority of data, and therefore, normality and equal variance
was assumed for all samples. Data were represented as the mean of
the indicated experimental replicates. Error bars represent the stan-
dard deviation (SD) or the standard error of the mean (SEM), as indi-
cated in the figure legends. P-values inferior to 0.0001 were assigned
a value of P = 0.0001. P-values are indicated in the figures.
