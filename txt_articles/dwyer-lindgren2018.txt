IMPORTANCE Substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorders and drug use
disorders, and intentional injuries, including self-harm and interpersonal violence, are
important causes of early death and disability in the United States.
OBJECTIVE To estimate age-standardized mortality rates by county from alcohol use
disorders, drug use disorders, self-harm, and interpersonal violence in the United States.
DESIGN AND SETTING Validated small-area estimation models were applied to deidentified
death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and population counts
from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database to estimate
county-level mortality rates from 1980 to 2014 for alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders,
self-harm, and interpersonal violence.
EXPOSURES County of residence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age-standardized mortality rates by US county (N = 3110),
year, sex, and cause.
RESULTS Between 1980 and 2014, there were 2 848 768 deaths due to substance use
disorders and intentional injuries recorded in the United States. Mortality rates from alcohol
use disorders (n = 256 432), drug use disorders (n = 542 501), self-harm (n = 1 289 086), and
interpersonal violence (n = 760 749) varied widely among counties. Mortality rates
decreased for alcohol use disorders, self-harm, and interpersonal violence at the national
level between 1980 and 2014; however, over the same period, the percentage of counties in
which mortality rates increased for these causes was 65.4% for alcohol use disorders, 74.6%
for self-harm, and 6.6% for interpersonal violence. Mortality rates from drug use disorders
increased nationally and in every county between 1980 and 2014, but the relative increase
varied from 8.2% to 8369.7%. Relative and absolute geographic inequalities in mortality, as
measured by comparing the 90th and 10th percentile among counties, decreased for alcohol
use disorders and interpersonal violence but increased substantially for drug use disorders
and self-harm between 1980 and 2014.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mortality due to alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders,
self-harm, and interpersonal violence varied widely among US counties, both in terms of
levels of mortality and trends. These estimates may be useful to inform efforts to target
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment to improve health and reduce inequalities.

 S
ubstance use disorders (ie, drug use disorders and
alcohol use disorders) and intentional injuries
(ie, self-harm and interpersonal violence) impose a
significant health and financial burden in the United States.
In 2015, substance use disorders and intentional injuries
comprised 3.9% of all deaths.1 Because substance use disor-
ders and intentional injuries disproportionately impact
young and middle-aged adults, nearly 10% of all years of life
lost were due to these causes.1 Moreover, recent research
has implicated so-called deaths of despair, including sub-
stance use disorders and self-harm, in contributing to the
increasing rates of midlife mortality among certain demo-
graphic groups.2,3
A number of studies have previously documented
significant geographic variation in mortality rates from
self-harm,4-6 interpersonal violence,4-7 and drug poisoning.8,9
Information on how mortality rates vary spatially at a local
level is an important input for developing an effective public
health and policy response. However, existing studies4-7
of spatial patterns in mortality from self-harm and interper-
sonal violence are primarily from the 1980s and 1990s,
and more timely data on local-level trends are unavailable.
Additionally, studies8,9 of drug poisoning have failed to
distinguish between accidental and intentional overdoses
(ie, overdoses intended to self-inflict harm or to harm others),
despite important differences in the underlying etiology of
unintentional and intentional overdoses.
More recently, a new small-area methodology was used to
estimate county-level trends in mortality from 21 major causes
of death.10 Among these 21 categories were mental and sub-
stance use disorders (which combines both drug use disor-
ders and alcohol use disorders as well as deaths due to sev-
eral mental health disorders) and intentional injuries (which
combines self-harm and interpersonal violence).
This study utilizes the same small-area estimation method
to describe county-level trends in mortality rates separately
for 4 causes: alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, self-
harm, and interpersonal violence from 1980 to 2014.
Methods
This study used previously reported methods10 that are
described briefly in this section. This research received in-
stitutional review board approval from the University of
Washington. Informed consent was not required because the
study used deidentified data and was retrospective.
Data
This analysis used deidentified death records from the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)11 and popula-
tion counts from the US Census Bureau,12 NCHS,13-15 and the
Human Mortality Database.16 Deaths and population were
tabulated by county of residence, age group (0, 1-4, 5-9, …,
70-74, 75-79, and ≥80 years), sex, year, and (for deaths
only) underlying cause. County-level covariates, including
levels of education, income, race/ethnicity, Native American
reservations, and population density were derived from
data provided by the US Census Bureau and NCHS (eTable 1
in the Supplement). Counties were combined as needed to
ensure historically stable units of analysis (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Cause List and Garbage Redistribution
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
Study (GBD) cause list was used for this analysis.1 This cause
list is arranged hierarchically in 4 levels, and within each
level, the list is exhaustive and mutually exclusive. eTable 3
(in the Supplement) lists all causes in the GBD cause list and
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD-9) and ICD-10 codes that correspond to each cause.
The focus of this study was on substance use disorders and
intentional injuries, specifically: alcohol use disorders (ICD-9
codes 291-291.9, 303-303.93, 305.0-305.03, 357.5, 790.3,
E860-E860.19; ICD-10 codes F10-F10.99, G31.2, G72.1, P04.3,
Q86.0, R78.0, X45-X45.9), drug use disorders (ICD-9 codes
292-292.9, 304.0-304.83, 305, 305.1-305.93, 760.7-760.79,
E850-E850.29; ICD-10 codes F11-F16.99, F18-F19.99, P04.4-
P04.49, P96.1, R78.1-R78.5), self-harm (ICD-9 codes E950-
E959; ICD-10 codes X60-X84.9, Y87.0), and interpersonal
violence (ICD-9 codes E960-E969; ICD-10 codes X85-Y08.9,
Y87.1). However, all causes of death in the GBD cause list
were analyzed concurrently.
Previous studies have documented the existence of
“garbage codes”—insufficiently specific or implausible
cause of death codes used in death registration data that
may lead to misleading geographic and temporal patterns.17
Algorithms developed for the GBD (and described in detail
elsewhere1,10) were used to reallocate deaths assigned
one of these garbage codes to plausible alternatives. First,
plausible target causes were assigned to each garbage
code or group of garbage codes. Second, deaths were reas-
signed to specified target codes according to proportions
derived in 1 of 4 ways: (1) published literature or expert
opinion; (2) regression models; (3) according to the propor-
tions initially observed among targets; and (4) for HIV/AIDs
Key Points
Question What are the spatial and temporal trends in mortality
due to alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, self-harm,
and interpersonal violence among US counties from
1980 to 2014?
Findings In this study of 2 848 768 deaths in the United States
from 1980 to 2014, mortality rates varied widely among counties
and increased by 618.3% for drug use disorders but decreased by
8.1% for alcohol use disorders, 6.0% for self-harm, and 44.9% for
interpersonal violence. Mortality rates due to drug use disorders
increased in every county, while mortality rates due to alcohol use
disorders, self-harm, and interpersonal violence increased in some
counties and decreased in others.
Meaning Between 1980 and 2014, there were important
differences among US counties in the level and trend in mortality
rates due to alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, self-harm,
and interpersonal violence.

Small-Area Models
Bayesian, spatially explicit mixed-effects regression models
were estimated separately for each cause and for males and
females. The model was specified as
Dj,t,a � Poisson(mj,t,a ·Pj,t,a)
log(mj,t,a) = β0 + β1 Xj,t + γ1,a,t + γ2,j + (γ3,j ·t + γ4,j,t) + (γ5,j ·α
+ γ6,j,a)
in which Dj,t,a indicates the number of deaths, Pj,t,a indicates
the population, and mj,t,a indicates the underlying mortality
rate for a given county (j), year (t), and age group (a). The
model for mj,t,a contained 6 components: an intercept (β0);
fixed covariate effects (β1); random age-time effects (γ1,a,t);
random spatial effects (γ2,j); random space-time effects (γ3,j
and γ4,j,t); and random space-age effects (γ5,j and γ6,j,a). The
model incorporated 7 covariates: the proportion of the adult
population who graduated from high school, the proportion
of the population that is Hispanic (regardless of race), the
proportion of the population that is black (regardless of
Hispanic ethnicity), the proportion of the population that is
a race other than black or white (regardless of Hispanic eth-
nicity), the proportion of a county that is contained within a
state or federal Native American reservation, the median
household income, and the population density. The random
effects γ1, γ2, γ3, and γ5 were assumed to follow conditional
autoregressive distributions, which allow for smoothing
over adjacent age groups and years (γ1) or counties (γ2, γ3,
and γ5).18,19 The random effects γ4 and γ6 were assumed to
follow independent mean-zero normal distributions.
Models were fit using the Template Model Builder
Package20 in the R statistical software (version 3.2.4). One
thousand draws of mj,t,a were taken from the posterior distri-
bution and then raked (ie, scaled along multiple dimensions)
by cause and by county to ensure consistency between lev-
els of the cause hierarchy as well as with national estimates
from the GBD.1,10,21 Mortality rates for both sexes combined
were calculated from the population-weighted average of
the male and female mortality rates. Age-standardized mor-
tality rates were calculated using the US 2010 census popula-
tion as the standard. Years of life lost were calculated by
multiplying the mortality rate by population by age-specific
life expectancy from the reference life table used in the GBD1
and then summing across all ages. Point estimates were
calculated from the mean of all draws, and 95% uncertainty
intervals (UIs) were calculated from the 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles. Changes over time were considered statisti-
cally significant if the posterior probability of an increase
(or decrease) was at least 95% (ie, if there was an increase
(or decrease) in more than 95% of the 1000 posterior draws).
Changes over the full time range (1980-2014) were the
primary focus; however, changes between 1980 and 2000,
as well as changes between 2000 and 2014, were also con-
sidered because preliminary results indicated a reversal
in trends from 2000 to 2014 compared with 1980 to 2000
for self-harm.
No explicit correction for multiple testing (ie, across
multiple counties) was applied; however, the risk of spuri-
ously detecting changes due to multiple testing was miti-
gated by modeling all counties simultaneously. County-level
inequality in mortality rates was quantified by comparing
the 10th and 90th percentile rates among counties: the dif-
ference between the 10th and 90th percentile was used as a
measure of absolute geographic inequality and the ratio
between the 10th and 90th percentile was used as a mea-
sure of relative geographic inequality.
Results
A total of 2 848 768 deaths due to substance use disorders
and intentional injuries were recorded in the United States
between 1980 and 2014. Of these deaths, 73.9% were origi-
nally assigned ICD codes that map exclusively to 1 of these 4
causes, including 91.1% of deaths due to alcohol use disor-
ders, 15.0% of deaths due to drug use disorders, 87.6% of
deaths due to self-harm, and 88.6% of deaths due to inter-
personal violence. ICD codes related to accidental poison-
ings (ICD-9: E850.3-E854.3, E854.8, E855-E855.6, E855.8-
E855.9, E858-E858.9, E866-E866.9; ICD-10: X40-X44.9,
X49-X49.9), which were redistributed primarily to sub-
stance use disorders among individuals aged 15 years and
older and to unintentional poisonings among individuals
younger than age 15 years, contributed 5.2% of deaths due
to alcohol use disorders and 80.0% of deaths due to drug
use disorders. ICD codes related to injury deaths for which
intent was undetermined (ICD-9: E980-E989; ICD-10: Y10-
Y34.9, Y86-87, Y87.2, Y89, Y89.9, Y90-Y99.9) contributed a
further 1.2% of deaths due to alcohol use disorders, 1.4% of
deaths due to drug use disorders, 6.7% of deaths due to self-
harm, and 5.3% of deaths due to interpersonal violence. In
addition, other garbage codes contributed 2.4% of deaths
due to alcohol use disorders, 3.6% of deaths due to drug use
disorders, 5.6% of deaths due to self-harm, and 6.1% of
deaths due to interpersonal violence.
Alcohol Use Disorders
Between 1980 and 2014, there were 256 432 deaths due to
alcohol use disorders recorded in the United States. In 2014,
the age-standardized national mortality rate due to alcohol
use disorders was 2.8 (95% UI, 2.7-3.0) deaths per 100 000
persons but varied among counties from 0.6 deaths per
100 000 to 38.8 deaths per 100 000 persons (Table 1). The
distribution of counties, according to the mortality rate from
alcohol use disorders, was highly skewed: in 2014, the 90th
percentile among counties was 4.7 deaths per 100 000, com-
pared with the maximum rate of 38.8 deaths per 100 000
persons (Table 1). Western counties generally experienced
higher levels of mortality than counties in the East, and
counties with especially high mortality rates, compared with
the rest of United States (>12.9 deaths per 100 000 persons
[top 1%]), were found in parts of Wisconsin, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona,
Utah, and Alaska (Figure 1).

 Nationally, the age-standardized mortality rate from
alcohol use disorders decreased by 8.1% (95% UI, −0.5% to
21.1%) between 1980 and 2014 due to a decrease of 11.0%
(95% UI, 3.9% to 18.8%) between 1980 and 2000 and an
increase of 3.2% (95% UI, −3.9% to 10.0%) between 2000 and
2014 (Table 2). Despite the national decrease in alcohol use
mortality between 1980 and 2014, more counties experi-
enced increases in the mortality rate (65.4%; statistically sig-
nificant in 26.8% of counties) than decreases (34.6%; statisti-
cally significant in 12.5% of counties). Counties with above
average increases were located predominantly in the north-
ern and western United States. In contrast, counties with par-
ticularly large decreases (>67.8% [top 1%]) were found in
South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Florida,
and Alaska (Figure 1). The degree of absolute and relative
inequality among counties in mortality from alcohol use dis-
orders decreased from 1980 to 2014 (Table 1; 99.7% posterior
probability of decrease in absolute inequality; >99.9% poste-
rior probability of decrease in relative inequality); in 1980,
the mortality rate in counties in the 10th percentile was 1.1
deaths per 100 000 persons and the mortality rate in coun-
ties in the 90th percentile was 5.0 deaths per 100 000 per-
sons (absolute difference, 3.8 deaths per 100 000 persons;
relative difference, 4.3-fold), compared to a 2014 mortality
rate of 1.5 deaths per 100 000 persons in counties in the 10th
percentile and a mortality rate of 4.7 deaths per 100 000 per-
sons in counties in the 90th percentile (absolute difference,
3.2 deaths per 100 000 persons; relative difference, 3.2-fold).
Drug Use Disorders
Between 1980 and 2014, there were 542 501 deaths due to
drug use disorders recorded in the United States. Nationally,
the age-standardized mortality rate from drug use disorders
was 10.4 (95% UI, 9.7 to 10.9) deaths per 100 000 persons in
2014, while at the county level, mortality rates varied from
1.6 deaths per 100 000 to 57.1 deaths per 100 000 persons
(Table 1). The distribution of counties by mortality rate was
highly skewed: the 90th percentile among counties was 17.0
deaths per 100 000 persons, compared to the maximum rate
of 57.1 deaths per 100 000 persons (Table 1). Counties near
the border of Kentucky and West Virginia, as well as indi-
vidual counties in New Mexico, Alabama, Indiana, Tennes-
see, and Virginia had very high mortality rates relative to the
rest of the United States (>32.3 deaths per 100 000 persons
[top 1%]) (Figure 2).
Nationally, the age-standardized mortality rate due to
drug use disorders increased by 238.2% (95% UI, 211.8% to
261.5%) from 1980 to 2000 and by 112.4% (95% UI, 98.4% to
125.7%) from 2000 to 2014, for an overall increase of 618.3%
(95% UI, 526.8% to 648.3%) between 1980 and 2014
(Table 2). Mortality rates increased in every county between
1980 and 2014 (statistically significant in 99.8% of counties),
although the magnitude of this increase varied regionally.
Counties located in Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana,
and eastern Oklahoma experienced the largest increases
(>5000%) over this period (Figure 2). As a result of this vari-
ability, there was a marked increase in both absolute and

 persons [top 1%]) were found primarily in states in the West-
ern United States, including Alaska, Nevada, South Dakota,
Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon,
and Wyoming, as well as 1 county in Maryland (Figure 3).
The age-standardized mortality rate due to self-harm
decreased by 6.0% (95% UI, 1.0% to 11.2%) overall be-
tween 1980 and 2014 (Table 1) due to a decrease of 15.3%
(95% UI, 11.3% to 19.1%) between 1980 and 2000 and an
increase of 11.0% (95% UI, 6.4% to 15.7%) from 2000 to
2014 (Table 2). Most counties experienced an increase in
self-harm mortality from 1980 to 2014 (74.6%; statistically
significant in 50.1% of counties). Counties with particularly
large increases (>74.4% [top 1%]) in mortality from self-
harm were found in Alaska, Utah, Arkansas, Montana,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Colorado, Indiana,
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, South Dakota, and Texas
(Figure 3). Absolute and relative inequality among counties
in mortality from self-harm also increased over this period
(Table 1; posterior probability of increase >99.9%): in 1980
the mortality rate in counties in the 10th percentile was 11.2
deaths per 100 000 persons and for counties in the 90th
percentile was 18.9 deaths per 100 000 persons (absolute
difference, 7.6 deaths per 100 000 persons; relative differ-
ence, 1.7-fold), compared to a 2014 mortality rate of 11.6
deaths per 100 000 persons for counties in the 10th percen-
tile and 23.0 deaths per 100 000 persons for counties in the
90th percentile (absolute difference, 11.5 deaths per
100 000 persons; relative difference, 2.0-fold).
Interpersonal Violence
Between 1980 and 2014, there were 760 749 deaths due to
interpersonal violence recorded in the United States. The
national age-standardized mortality rate due to interpersonal
violence was 5.7 (95% UI, 5.5 to 6.0) deaths per 100 000 per-
sons in 2014. Among counties, the mortality rate from inter-
personal violence varied from 1.0 deaths per 100 000 to 35.7
deaths per 100 000 persons, with a 7.1 deaths per 100 000-
persons gap between the 10th and 90th percentile (Table 1).
Counties with very high mortality rates from interpersonal
violence (>19.1 deaths per 100 000 persons [top 1%]) were
found along the southern half of the Mississippi River and
in Alabama, as well as in Alaska, Montana, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Kansas, Michigan, Maryland, Virginia, and
North Carolina (Figure 4).
Nationally, the age-standardized mortality rate due to
interpersonal violence decreased by 34.6% (95% UI, 31.0% to
37.4%) from 1980 to 2000 and by 15.6% (95% UI, 11.7% to
19.0%) from 2000 to 2014, for an overall decrease of 44.9%
(95% UI, 41.0% to 47.7%) between 1980 and 2014 (Table 2).
Most counties also experienced a decrease between 1980 and
2014 (93.4%; statistically significant in 44.2% of counties),
although increases in the mortality rate due to interpersonal
violence were observed in 6.6% of counties (statistically sig-
nificant in 0.5%). Counties with increases were concentrated
in northern Midwestern and Atlantic states, while counties
with the largest decreases (>70.6% [top 1%]) were found in
Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Texas, California, and New York
(Figure 4). Despite these differences, both absolute and rela-
tive inequality among counties in mortality from interper-
sonal violence decreased substantially over this period
(Table 1; posterior probability of decrease >99.9%); in 1980,
the mortality rate in counties in the 10th percentile was
2.5 deaths per 100 000 persons and for counties in the 90th
percentile, it was 15.5 deaths per 100 000 persons (absolute

Discussion
This study documents spatial and temporal variation in
mortality rates from 4 causes of death: alcohol use disor-
ders, drug use disorders, self-harm, and interpersonal vio-
lence. For all 4 causes, there were substantial differences
in mortality rates among counties. Moreover, for drug use
disorders and self-harm, these differences have increased
over time. The findings in this study may help clinicians,

 local health authorities, and policymakers address the bur-
den of substance use disorders and intentional injuries in
their communities.
The results of this study are consistent with earlier
reports, based on data from the 1980s and early 1990s, of
large regional differences in mortality rates from self-harm
and interpersonal violence.4-6 This study improves on these
earlier efforts by using small-area estimation methods that
do not require pooling multiple years of data or combining
counties into larger areas, and it also updates these analyses
to include data from more recent decades. A number of pre-
vious studies have also considered regional differences in
unintentional poisonings5,23 or all drug use overdoses,8,9 but
in the former case, they do not distinguish between drug-
and alcohol-related poisonings and other types of poisoning,
and in the latter case do not distinguish between intentional
overdoses (ie, as a means of self-harm or interpersonal vio-
lence) and unintentional overdoses. To our knowledge, this
study is the first to consider alcohol and drug use disorders,
apart from other types of unintentional poisonings and dis-
tinct from intentional overdoses, at the county level in the
United States.

 Substance use disorders and intentional injury are respon-
sible for a significant health burden in the United States, par-
ticularlyamongyoungandmiddle-agedadults.Indeed,among
people aged 15 to 49 years in the United States, self-harm, drug
use disorders, and interpersonal violence are the first, sec-
ond, and fifth leading causes of death; combined, substance
usedisordersandintentionalinjuriesareresponsiblefornearly
one-third of all deaths in this age group.1
Overall, there was a slight decrease in mortality from
alcohol use disorders between 1980 and 2014, although there
were geographic areas, such as Alaska and the region in
which the 4 Southwest states of Utah, Colorado, Arizona,
and New Mexico meet, that had very high mortality rates
relative to rest of the country, and many counties experi-
enced an increase in the mortality rate due to alcohol use dis-
orders over the same period. However, mortality rates from
drug use disorders increased by more than 600% between
1980 and 2014, largely due to increasing numbers of deaths
from both prescription and nonprescription opioid
overdoses.24 Every county experienced an increase in deaths
from drug use disorders, but that the burden of drug use
overdoses was particularly acute in certain communities,

 with more than a 4-fold variation from counties in the 10th
percentile to counties in the 90th percentile. These findings
highlight the need for a multipronged public health response
focusing on prevention, harm-reduction, treatment, and
recovery support.25 Potentially beneficial strategies for
each of these dimensions have been described, including
fully implementing safer prescribing practices for opioid
analgesics,26 increasing availability of the opioid antagonist
Naloxone,27 and expanding access to treatment (including
behavioral therapies and medication-assisted treatment).25
Moreover, fuller integration of substance use disorder screen-
ing and treatment into primary care and other health care
settings is required to promote earlier identification of at-risk
or affected individuals and increase access to and utilization
of appropriate services.25
Mortality rates from self-harm decreased overall between
1980 and 2014, but despite this overall decrease, mortality
rates from self-harm increased between 2000 and 2014. In
terms of geographic variation, deaths from self-harm were
particularly high in regions of the Western United States with
high rates of firearm availability and relatively low popula-
tion density. Further action is required to reverse these
recent increases and reduce the substantial health and social
burden imposed by self-harm. In particular, improved access
to effective mental health services,28 and structural
approaches such as means reduction29,30 should be consid-
ered. In contrast to self-harm, mortality rates due to interper-
sonal violence decreased substantially between 1980 and
2014. Nonetheless, there was still significant inequality
among counties with certain regions experiencing much
higher rates of mortality due to interpersonal violence than
the nation as a whole. In general, these counties were not
located in regions typically noted for high rates of gun own-
ership (eg, the Western United States), nor were they primar-
ily in more urban areas as might be expected. Substance use
disorders increase the risk of suicide and intentional injuries,
and efforts to reduce exposure to drugs and alcohol through
prevention and treatment for at-risk individuals may also
help to reduce mortality rates from self-harm and interper-
sonal violence in addition to mortality rates from substance
use disorders; in 2015, 23% of deaths due to self-harm and
18% of deaths due to interpersonal violence were attributable
to substance use.31
Relative geographic inequality in mortality rates from
the conditions discussed in this article (a ratio of 4.2 for
drug use disorders and 4.7 for interpersonal violence
between counties in the 90th and the 10th percentile in
2014) was high compared to most other causes (eg, this ratio
ranges from 1.2 to 2.2 among different cancers)32 This
suggests that there are important opportunities to more
closely examine counties and communities with notably
high or low mortality rates or particularly substantial
increases or decreases in the mortality rate over time. Such
research could facilitate identifying potential solutions to
these problems that might include social, cultural, legal,
policy, or health service–related approaches.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the population,
deaths, and covariates data used are all subject to error. Sec-
ond, the garbage code redistribution algorithms used to
redistribute deaths assigned implausible or nonspecific
causes to likely true causes of death have not been validated
because appropriate criterion standard data are unavailable.
Third, although these redistribution methods are likely asso-
ciated with nontrivial uncertainty, this uncertainty is difficult
to quantify and consequently has not been included in the
uncertainty intervals associated with the estimated mortality
rates. Fourth, the small-area models used in this analysis
smooth mortality rates over time, space, and age groups, and
may in some cases attenuate unusually low or high mortality
rates, underestimating true geographic variability.
Conclusions
Mortality due to alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, self-
harm, and interpersonal violence varied widely among US
counties, both in terms of levels of mortality and trends. These
estimates may be useful to inform efforts to target preven-
tion, diagnosis, and treatment efforts to improve health and
reduce inequalities.
