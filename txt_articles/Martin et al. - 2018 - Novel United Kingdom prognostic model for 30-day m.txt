Objective existing clinical prediction models (cPM) 
for short-term mortality after transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation (taVi) have limited applicability in the UK 
due to moderate predictive performance and inconsistent 
recording practices across registries. the aim of this study 
was to derive a UK-taVi cPM to predict 30-day mortality 
risk for benchmarking purposes.
Methods a two-step modelling strategy was 
undertaken: first, data from the UK-taVi registry 
between 2009 and 2014 were used to develop a 
multivariable logistic regression cPM using backwards 
stepwise regression. second, model-updating techniques 
were applied using the 2013–2014 data, thereby 
leveraging new approaches to include frailty and to 
ensure the model was reflective of contemporary 
practice. internal validation was performed by 
bootstrapping to estimate in-sample optimism-corrected 
performance.
results Between 2009 and 2014, up to 6339 patients 
were included across 34 centres in the UK-taVi registry 
(mean age, 81.3; 2927 female (46.2%)). the observed 
30-day mortality rate was 5.14%. the final UK-taVi 
cPM included 15 risk factors, which included two 
variables associated with frailty. after correction for in-
sample optimism, the model was well calibrated, with a 
calibration intercept of 0.02 (95% ci −0.17 to 0.20) and 
calibration slope of 0.79 (95% ci 0.55 to 1.03). the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve, after 
adjustment for in-sample optimism, was 0.66.
Conclusion the UK-taVi cPM demonstrated strong 
calibration and moderate discrimination in UK-taVi 
patients. this model shows potential for benchmarking, 
but even the inclusion of frailty did not overcome the 
need for more wide-ranging data and other outcomes 
might usefully be explored.
InTrOduCTIOn
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) 
has emerged as the indicated treatment option for 
patients with aortic stenosis who are intermediate 
to high-risk surgical candidates.1–3 Assessment of 
procedural risk is predominantly undertaken by 
the Heart Team, guided by multiple clinical predic-
tion models (CPM).4 To this end, CPMs such as the 
EuroSCORE5 or the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 
(STS) mortality score6 have been used to guide 
estimation of procedural risk and employed in 
randomised controlled trials of TAVI.1–3 However, 
surgical-based models are known to perform poorly 
at predicting mortality in TAVI patients.7 8 
Consequently, there have been recent attempts 
to derive procedure-specific CPMs using national 
registries; 
examples 
include 
the 
FRANCE-2 
model,9 the Italian OBSERVANT model10 and the 
American College of Cardiology (ACC) model.11 
Primarily, one is interested in using such TAVI 
CPMs to underpin procedure audit analyses across 
TAVI centres, to facilitate discussion of risk with the 
patient and to aid comparison of randomised trials. 
However, existing models have only moderate 
performance when applied in samples outside of 
their development cohorts.12 Indeed, within the UK, 
there is no validated CPM for predicting mortality 
post-TAVI,13 and heterogeneity in the variables 
recorded among national registries restricts the 
application of existing models into UK practice. 
As such, developing a CPM for UK-TAVI patients 
is vital, especially since one of the fundamental 
incentives for collecting national registry data is 
to monitor centre-level performance for audit and 
feedback purposes.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop 
and internally validate a multivariable TAVI CPM 
for predicting 30-day mortality in UK-TAVI patients 
(hereto called the UK-TAVI CPM), to facilitate clin-
ical discussions around procedure risk with the 
patient during the consent process, and for national 
benchmarking/audit analyses.

The reporting of this manuscript adheres to the 
TRIPOD checklist for the reporting of multivari-
able prediction models.14 The completed checklist

uK-TAVI registry
The UK-TAVI Registry prospectively collects data 
for every TAVI procedure conducted in the UK 
 
(34 centres) through a web-based interface.15 This 
study included data on all TAVI procedures between 
January 2009 and December 2014. Procedures were 
predominately undertaken via transfemoral access, 
using either the Edwards SAPIEN or the Medtronic 
CoreValve families of devices (with their various 
iterations over time), although other access routes

and valve types were available. The registry records information 
on patient baseline demographics, risk factors for intervention 
and procedural details. Frailty information was only recorded 
within the registry from January 2013 through the KATZ Index 
of activities of daily living,16 the Canadian Study of Health and 
Aging (CSHA) frailty scale17 and an indicator of poor mobility 
(as defined in the EuroSCORE II model5).
Outcome and cohort definition
All-cause mortality tracking was independently obtained from 
the Office for National Statistics, with administrative censoring 
occurring on 31 May 2015; this information was used to define 
the binary endpoint of 30-day mortality after TAVI. Mortality 
information was unavailable for patients in Northern Ireland 
and Scotland; consequently, these patients were excluded, along 
with any patient in England and Wales with missing mortality 
information. Thus, the main development sample included all 
TAVI patients with 30-day mortality indication across England 
and Wales, between January 2009 and December 2014.
Predictors
For development of the UK-TAVI CPM, we considered all vari-
ables available prior to the TAVI procedure (see online supple-
mentary table 1 for the full list of considered covariates, with 
translation to the UK-TAVI Registry). Our decision to include 
access route as a candidate covariate was made in line with 
previous TAVI CPM development data sets,9 11 and represents 
the potential risk/complications/comorbidities associated with a 
non-transfemoral approach. Age and sex were always included 
in the model, with age being mean centred. Quadratic and cubic 
transformations of continuous variables were considered.
Missing data
Multiple imputation by chain equations was used to handle 
missing data, with this analysis generating 10 imputed data sets.18 
The imputation models for each baseline covariate included the 
majority of other variables in the UK-TAVI Registry and the 
survival data (both the survival event indicator and the cumula-
tive baseline hazard19), the latter of which was included because 
this was used to derive 30-day mortality indication. Prior to 
analysis, we checked all the imputations to ensure convergence 
and checked that the distributions of observed and imputed 
values were similar. Since multiple imputation assumes a missing 
at random mechanism, we undertook a sensitivity analysis of this 
assumption as described below.
statistical analysis
A two-stage modelling strategy was implemented to derive the 
CPM (figure 1). We first derived a logistic regression model 
within the 2009–2014 data, considering only those variables 
that were observed throughout this period (ie, none of the frailty 
measures), using the ‘majority method’ of developing CPMs 
within multiple imputed data.20 Here, the following steps were 
undertaken: (1) perform backwards selection using Akaike infor-
mation criterion in each of the 10 imputed data sets, resulting in 
10 (potentially unique) sets of predictors; (2) extract variables 
that were selected in >50% of the imputed data sets; (3) given 
the extracted variables, fit a model in each imputed data set, 
then pool the estimated coefficients and SEs across imputations 
according to Rubin’s rules.18 The Akaike information criterion 
for backwards selection corresponds to a P value of 0.157 for a 
variable with 1 df.
In the second stage, we updated this derived model using 
model-updating techniques within the last 2 
years of data21 22 
(figure 1). Here, a logistic regression model was fit to 30-day 
mortality within the 2013–2014 data, with the calculated linear 
predictor (LP) from the 2009–2014 derived model, KATZ, 
CSHA and poor mobility as covariates (see online supplementary 
methods for mathematical details). The likelihood ratio test was 
used to determine if any of the three frailty measures significantly

improved the fit of the model, with only those meeting this crite-
rion included in the final model. The reasoning for this second 
modelling step was twofold. First, it uses all available data as 
the foundations of the UK-TAVI CPM, while ensuring that the 
model is reflective of most contemporary practice/technology. 
Second, it provides a way of considering frailty variables within 
the model, which we hypothesised a priori would be important 
predictors of mortality,23 but were only recorded within the 
registry from January 2013.
Predictive performance was assessed through calibration and 
discrimination. Calibration is the agreement between the observed 
and expected risk, which was quantified by the calibration inter-
cept and calibration slope, with reference values of 0 and 1, respec-
tively.24 Discrimination of a model is its ability to distinguish those 
who experienced the outcome from those who did not, and was 
estimated with the area under the receiver operating character-
istic (ROC) curve (AUC). Throughout, we use the term ‘apparent 
performance’ to denote the predictive performance of a model 
within the data set in which it was developed. As such, the apparent 
performance was obtained by applying the final model coefficients 
to each patient within the 2013–2014 data across the 10 imputed 
data sets and pooling performance results across imputations (using 
Rubin’s rules18). Internal validation was undertaken using bootstrap 
resampling of the 2013–2014 data to estimate optimism-corrected 
performance (figure 1)22 25; details of this process are given in the 
online supplementary material. In short, the bootstrap resampling 
represents sampling from the underlying population to estimate 
in-sample optimism, which can be subtracted from the apparent 
model performance. These internal validation results should be 
treated as the primary measures of predictive performance.

.3.4.026 was used for all statistical analyses. Multiple imputa-
tion of the data set was completed using the mice package,27 and 
the package pROC was used for constructing ROC curves.28 All 
other codes were written by the authors and are available upon 
request.
sensitivity analyses
Instead of using multiple imputation, the first sensitivity analysis 
(singularly) imputed all missing continuous variables using the 
sex-matched median of the observed values, and missing cate-
gorical variables using the mode. For the majority of categor-
ical variables this will result in a ‘risk factor absent’ assumption 
and corresponds to a viable missing not-at random assump-
tion. Similar modelling steps to the main analysis were then 
performed using this single imputation strategy. The second 
sensitivity analysis performed the ‘majority method’ of variable 
selection directly within the 2013–2014 data set to examine the 
robustness of the two-stage modelling strategy.
resulTs
Between January 2009 and December 2014, up to 7070 
patients were recorded in the registry. After excluding patients 
in Northern Ireland (n=379) and Scotland (n=193), a further 
159 patients were removed due to missing life status. Hence, 
the development sample for the main analysis included 6339 
patients (figure 2). Baseline characteristics and proportions 
of missing data for the main development cohort are given in 
table 1. The mean age of patients was 81.3 years, with 46.2% 
female. Most procedures were performed electively (12.5% 
non-elective), via transfemoral access (25.4% non-transfemoral 
access), and used a SAPIEN valve (56%). The proportion of 
missing data was low for most variables. The high percentages of 
missing data for the three frailty measures are due to these vari-
ables only being recorded from January 2013, after which the 
proportion of missing data for poor mobility, CSHA and KATZ 
was 1.79%, 1.65% and 11.0%, respectively.
Model development
Between January 2009 and December 2014, up to 326 patients 
died within 30 days of the procedure (5.14%), with this decreasing 
to 4.14% between January 2013 and December 2014. In univari-
able analysis, patients with higher (mean-centred) body mass index

(BMI), higher glomerular filtration rate and indication of sinus 
rhythm had decreased odds of 30-day mortality (table 2). Renal 
failure, extracardiac arteriopathy, calcification of ascending aorta, 
prior balloon aortic valvuloplasty, critical preoperative status, 
New York Heart Association class IV
, poor mobility, CSHA frailty, 
KATZ (per point drop from 6 points), left ventricular ejection frac-
tion <50%, non-elective procedure and non-transfemoral access 
each had increased odds of 30-day mortality.
The variables selected in the final multivariable model 
(denoted UK-TAVI CPM) are given in table 3. The model inter-
cept was −3.6119, with 15 variables included in the model, 2 
of which were frailty measures (ie, KATZ and poor mobility). 
One can calculate the log odds of 30-day mortality for a new 
patient by multiplying each covariate by the corresponding coef-
ficient in table 3 and summing across all variables—the so-called 
LP; the probability of 30-day mortality can then be obtained 
by transforming the LP as exp(LP)/{1+exp(LP)}. Figure 3 
depicts a graphical representation of this process. For example, 
an 85-year-old woman with a BMI of 30 
kg/m2, a glomerular 
filtration rate of 51 
mL/min/1.73 
m2 and KATZ score of 4 points 
would have log odds=−3.6119+((85−81.25)×0.0115)+(0.1
393)+((30−27.3)×−0.0257)+((30−27.3)2×0.0011)+([51/5] 
×−0.0342)+((6−4)×0.2362)=−3.3604, where [51/5]=10 (ie, 
floor rounding). This can be converted to a probability of 30-day 
mortality by exp(−3.3604)/{1+exp(−3.3604)}=0.0336×100
=3.36% (dotted arrows in figure 3).
Model validation
The UK-TAVI CPM was well calibrated before and after boot-
strap correction, with a calibration intercept and slope signifi-
cantly close to 0 and 1, respectively (table 4); the apparent 
performance calibration plot is given in online supplementary 
figure 1. The apparent AUC of the model was 0.70 (95% CI 
0.65 to 0.75), which reduced to 0.66 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.71) 
after bootstrap internal validation. The UK-TAVI CPM was well

calibrated and had moderate discrimination across quantiles of 
observed predicted risk, although performance was marginally 
worse in the second and third quantiles (online supplemen-
tary table 2). Bootstrap-corrected performance across patient 
subgroups is given in online supplementary table 3.
We examined the predictive performance across each centre, 
which demonstrated that the majority of centres had an observed 
event rate similar to that expected from the model (figure 4). 
However, there was heterogeneity in the calibration-in-the-large, 
with some centres performing ‘better’ than expected (calibration 
intercept <0), and others having an observed event rate higher 
than that expected by the model (calibration intercept >0).
sensitivity analyses
The first sensitivity analysis examined an alternative way of 
handling missing data, through a single imputation strategy. 
Most variables within the model derived under this approach 
were similar to those within the UK-TAVI CPM, but addition-
ally included an indicator of calcified aorta, and aortic valve 
peak gradient (online supplementary table 4). The performance

included similar but fewer variables to the main analysis model 
(online supplementary table 5). After bootstrap internal valida-
tion, the calibration slope for 2013–2014 derived model was 
significantly below 1 (0.69, 95% 
CI 0.45 to 0.92), indicating 
overfitting within the smaller sample size (demonstrating an 
advantage of the two-stage modelling strategy). The internal 
validation AUC of the 2013–2014 derived model was 0.64 (95% 
CI 0.59 to 0.69).
dIsCussIOn
This study has derived a TAVI risk prediction model for bench-
marking and audit analyses in UK patients. After covariate 
selection, the UK-TAVI CPM included 15 variables, including 
2 frailty-related measures. The model demonstrated strong 
calibration after correction for in-sample optimism, but only 
moderate discrimination. It is, therefore, of greater value in 
allowing comparison of risk-adjusted outcomes between centres 
than in aiding clinicians to provide accurate risk assessment to 
patients being offered TAVI.
Risk prediction in TAVI patients is an ongoing research 
area; the FRANCE-2,9 OBSERVANT,10 ACC11 and the herein 
UK-TAVI CPM each represent models derived exclusively 
on patients treated by TAVI and each share similar (clinically 
meaningful) risk factors. However, differences in the variables 
that are recorded across the national registries limit the ability 
to obtain a single generalisable model for practical use across 
countries. Thus, we have demonstrated the UK-TAVI CPM to 
be well calibrated both before and after correction for in-sample 
optimism, with an AUC of 0.70 and 0.66 within development 
and internal validation, respectively. Similar performance has 
been reported from the existing TAVI models within data sets 
similar to that in which they were developed.9–11 For example, 
the FRANCE-2 model had an AUC of 0.59 in a ‘test’ subset of 
the French registry,9 and the AUC within an internal validation 
of the ACC TAVI model was 0.66.11 However, a previous anal-
ysis of the UK registry found that the AUC of the existing TAVI 
CPMs was below 0.64 within the UK cohort.13
The limited discrimination of the UK-TAVI CPM means that 
this model is not yet ready for deployment when attempting 
to assess risk in individual cases. While one could question the 
need to use TAVI CPMs in such a capacity given the emerging 
evidence supporting expansion into low/intermediate-risk 
patients,3 CPMs are fundamental to appropriately adjust for 
case mix when investigating postprocedural outcomes across 
centres. In particular, the assessment of TAVI futility should 
consider multiple outcomes, including mortality, quality of life 
and hospital readmission, but the variability in the calibration 
intercept per TAVI centre (figure 4) indicates the importance of 
case-mix adjustment when comparing mortality rates. Conse-
quently, the herein derived model presents an important step in 
facilitating appropriate adjustment for case mix when making 
centre-level outcome comparisons in UK patients, with similar 
applications undertaken within the STS/ACC Transcatheter 
Valve Therapy Registry using the ACC model.11
However, it is inevitable that predictive performance will 
decrease when the UK-TAVI CPM is applied in populations 
distinct to that in which it was developed (external validation),22 
as observed when our group applied the France, Italian and 
American TAVI CPMs to the UK population.13 Since the primary

aim of the UK-TAVI CPM is for national benchmarking, the main 
implementation of this model will be within UK patients. To this 
end, the split sample method of internal validation (randomly 
splitting the data into training and test sets) is common, but this 
is an inefficient use of data.25 Consequently, we applied boot-
strapping methods to estimate the likely performance of the 
model in samples drawn from the registry. While lack of new 
and independent data from the UK registry meant that external 
validation was not possible, such an assessment of model perfor-
mance will need to be undertaken by independent investiga-
tors.29 As such, we encourage the validation of our model in 
future extracts of the UK registry to assess temporal validation. 
Unquestionably, the UK-TAVI CPM should not be regarded as a 
static tool, and the discovery of novel predictors will be funda-
mental for deriving future TAVI models. The rapid develop-
ment of TAVI techniques, knowledge and technology, combined 
with the possible expansion into lower risk patients, means the 
model should be continuously updated. The model needs to be 
maintained using contemporary extracts of the registry to avoid 
the calibration drift commonly observed in CPMs, such as that 
found in the logistic EuroSCORE.30 This would be equally appli-
cable to other contemporary risk scores used elsewhere.
limitations
The main strength of this study is that TAVI data collection is 
mandatory in the UK, meaning the UK-TAVI CPM has been 
developed using comprehensive national data. However, several 
limitations need to be considered. First, since we excluded all 
patients from Northern Ireland and Scotland due to lack of inde-
pendent mortality information, the model might not be represen-
tative of such patients. Second, this model only predicts 30-day 
mortality, but demonstrates the need for registries to routinely 
collect more wide-ranging outcomes (eg, hospital readmission, 
quality of life). Third, to maintain sufficient sample size, we 
included all data from 2009 to 2014, involving several iterations 
of valve types/devices. Although the modelling strategy aimed to 
revise the model using the 2013–2014 data, the UK-TAVI CPM 
will need to be updated in newer extracts to include patients 
exposed to only the most contemporary technology/practice. 
Finally, the generalisability of the model is unknown since we 
were unable to test the performance in independent data. Thus, 
we recommend independent researchers conduct future valida-
tion studies on the later extracts of the UK-TAVI Registry.
COnClusIOns
This analysis of the UK-TAVI Registry has developed a contem-
porary risk model on over 6000 TAVI patients. The validation 
procedure demonstrated that the model was well calibrated 
but achieved limited discrimination. Thus, the derived model 
has potential to be used for benchmarking analyses in UK-TAVI 
patients, but is not yet ready for deployment when attempting 
to assess risk in individual cases. Future external validation 
studies of the model within the UK population are required, 
and outcomes other than 30-day mortality might usefully be 
explored.

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
Existing clinical prediction models (CPM) for mortality following 
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have only 
moderate predictive performance when applied to populations 
distinct from those in which they were developed. Additionally, 
frailty has been shown to be an important predictor of mortality 
following TAVI, with the recent recording of frailty in national 
registries presenting opportunities to include such measures 
within the risk prediction.
What might this study add?
This study presents a contemporary multivariable CPM for 
predicting 30-day mortality after TAVI that included 15 risk 
factors, 2 of which were measures of frailty. This is the first 
model to be derived from the UK-TAVI Registry and presents 
an important step in facilitating appropriate adjustment for 
case mix when making centre-level outcome comparisons. The 
validation procedure demonstrated that the model was well 
calibrated and moderately discriminating.
how might this impact on clinical practice?
The model has potential to be used for benchmarking analyses in 
UK-TAVI patients by adjusting for case mix, and could facilitate 
clinical discussions around risk during the consent process. 
However, further development is needed as more data become 
available, and other outcomes should be explored.
