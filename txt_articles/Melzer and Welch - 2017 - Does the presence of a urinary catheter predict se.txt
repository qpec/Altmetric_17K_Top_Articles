Abstract 
Background: Sepsis is a major cause of mortality with an estimated 37 000 UK deaths 
each year. We aimed to determine host factors that can predict severe sepsis in a 
bacteraemic cohort.   
Methods: From December 2012 - November 2013, demographic, clinical and 
microbiological data were collected on consecutive patients with bacteraemia at a 
London teaching hospital site. Data were categorised into patients with severe sepsis 
(Pitt bacteraemia scores less than, or greater than or equal to 2) and multivariate 
logistic regression used to determine the association between host factors and severe 
sepsis.  
Findings: 594 bacteraemic episodes occurred in 500 patients who were divided 
according to Pitt scores. The majority of bacteraemic episodes occurred both in 
patients aged over 50, 382/594 (64.3%), and males, 346/594 (58.2%). Commonest 
isolates were Escherichia coli, 207/594 (34.8%) and Meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus 
aureus, 57/594 (9.6%). In logistic regression multivariable analysis, site of infection was 
significantly associated with severe sepsis. For catheter associated UTI, the association 
was significant after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson co-morbidity index and where 
infection was acquired, (OR 3.94, 95% CIs 1.70, 9.11).  
Conclusions: Urinary catheters increase the risk of severe sepsis. They should only be 
used if clinically indicated and, if inserted, a care bundle approach should be used and 
 4 
 
a removal date anticipated unless a long term catheter is required. In the context of 
sepsis, the presence of a urinary catheter should prompt immediate implementation 
of ‘sepsis 6’ and consideration of transfer to a critical care unit.

Introduction 
Sepsis is a major cause of mortality with an estimated 37 000 UK deaths each year (1). 
Death can occur at any age inside and outside of hospital. The presentation of sepsis 
can be non-specific and, the diagnosis may be delayed or even missed. A recent UK 
National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) concluded 
that there was a lack of urgency in the management of severe sepsis, with only 1 in 3 
patients receiving good care (2). The principle recommendations were that hospitals 
and primary care should have formal sepsis protocols, staff trained in their use and 
that all septic patients should receive a bundle of interventions, with senior 
Microbiology advice available within 24 hours. In 2015, NHS England introduced a 
commissioning for quality and innovation (CQUIN) payment for those NHS trusts 
screening for sepsis, taking cultures and administrating empirical antibiotics within 
one hour (3). 
Because of delays in diagnosis and initiation of treatment, new sepsis definitions in 
2015 were agreed to enable easier ‘out of hospital’ or bedside diagnosis (4). To 
optimise outcomes, a care bundle approach implemented within 1 hour is required 
(sepsis 6) (5) with further actions required within 6 hours if the patient is admitted to 
critical care. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends 
auditing outcomes in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock (6), not only to 
provide mortality data comparable to other institutions, but also to offer assurance 
that processes for managing sepsis are in place and working.  
 6 
 
Early recognition and treatment of sepsis is the key to improving outcomes. In the 
literature, however, there is little data on additional host factors that predict sepsis 
severity at the time of presentation, other than altered mental state, hypotension and 
tachypnoea (7). Early identification of factors that predict severe sepsis is important 
for inpatients that require management in critical care, but also for patients in the 
community seen before blood is taken and results made available. We, therefore, 
aimed to determine other patient factors that can predict severe sepsis by analysing 
data from a bacteraemic cohort at the Royal London Hospital (RLH) in East London.

Methods: 
Study setting 
The study was undertaken at the RLH, Barts Health NHS Trust. The RLH serves a 
diverse population of approximately 250 000 patients in Tower Hamlets, East London. 
It is a regional referral centre for the North East London sector. In addition to Accident 
and Emergency, general medicine, surgery, paediatric and maternity services, the 
RLH has 60 high dependency and critical care beds, (including neurosurgical, renal 
and Obstetric and Gynaecological beds), specialist wards for renal transplant and 
haemodialysis patients, and a high level neonatal intensive care unit.  
Study population 
From December 2012 to November 2013, consecutive in-patients with bacteraemia and 
fungaemia were prospectively collected. 
Definitions 
Significant bacteraemia or fungaemia was defined as a blood culture isolate, unlikely 
to be an environmental or skin contaminant, ascertained from a patient with a 
compatible clinical syndrome. This decision was based on the patient's history, 
examination findings, response to antimicrobial treatment, blood culture isolate and 
bacterial cultures from other body sites. Community and hospital-acquired 
bacteraemia or fungaemia were defined as a positive blood culture obtained at least 
48 hours before or after hospital admission respectively. Health-care associated 
 8 
 
infection (HCAI) was defined as an infection in a patient who had been hospitalised 
for more than 48 hours in the last 90 days or, in the 30 days before bacteraemia, resided 
in a nursing home or attended hospital for haemodialysis or intravenous therapy. 
Specialities at the time of treatment were categorised as medicine, surgery, critical 
care, obstetrics and gynaecology and paediatrics.  
Sites of infection associated with medical devices and procedures were defined 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance definitions 
(8). For central venous catheter (CVC)-associated infection, this was defined as 
evidence of infection (erythema, induration or pus) at a CVC exit site or isolation of 
the same organism from the blood or line tip. Catheter-associated urinary tract 
infections (UTIs) were defined as infection in patients with indwelling urethral or 
suprapubic catheters, or patients who intermittently self-catheterised, in the presence 
of symptoms or signs compatible with a UTI where no other source was identified. 
Other sites, not related to medical devices, were defined by clinical assessment, 
radiological imaging and additional bacterial cultures. Bacteraemia or fungaemia in 
patients with an unknown source were classified as undefined. Subsequent 
bacteraemic episodes were defined as an infection with the same organism occurring 
more than 28 days after the first episode, or a bacteraemic episode with a different 
organism occurring within 28 days.  
Appropriate treatment was defined as any component of an antibiotic regimen, 
empiric or definitive, used to treat an infection to which the organism was susceptible 
 9 
 
‘in vitro’. Delay in treatment was measured from the time a significant blood culture 
was obtained from the patient (9). This was irrespective of the onset of sepsis.   
Data collection 
Attending physicians were advised to obtain blood cultures from patients presenting 
with symptoms and signs suggestive of sepsis before administration of empirical 
antibiotics. Demographical, laboratory and clinical data were collected on all in-
patients who developed bacteraemia. A consultant Microbiologist, aided by several 
specialist registrars, reviewed case notes within 72 h of laboratory confirmation. In 
addition to demographic data, speciality at the time of bacteraemia, site of infection, 
organism, susceptibility profile, delay in appropriate treatment, Pitt bacteraemia 
score, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score (10) and outcomes were recorded. The 
Pitt bacteraemia score is a validated index used in other studies to quantify severity 
of infection, based on mental status, need for ventilation and vital signs. Patients were 
followed up until inpatient death, discharge home, transfer to a rehabilitation ward or 
recovery from infection.  
Patients were treated empirically according to local guidelines based on site of 
infection. Once susceptibility profiles were known, antibiotic treatment regimens 
were rationalised to narrow spectrum agents. Outcomes were recorded as 7-day, 30-
day and inpatient mortality. It was assumed that patients who were discharged prior 
to 7 or 30 days survived beyond 30 days.  
 10 
 
Microbiology data 
Blood cultures were analysed using the automated system BacT/ALERT3D 
(bioMérieux, Mary l'Etoile, France). Isolates were identified using either the VITEK 
MS system (bioMérieux, Mary l'Etoile, France, database v2.0) or Bruker Biotyper 
(Bruker Daltonics, Leipzig, Germany, software version 3.0) MALDI-TOF MS systems 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the laboratory standard operating 
procedures. Susceptibility testing was performed on the Microscan walkAway system 
(Siemans Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, Il, US).  
Data analysis 
Data were split by bacteraemia episodes with Pitt bacteraemia scores less than 2, or 
greater than and equal to 2. Even though some patients had more than one episode, 
we summarised for all episodes because many of these patients’ have episodes in both 
Pitt bacteraemia score categories. The data were presented as numbers with 
percentages and comparisons using Χ2 test were made. Host factors investigated for 
association with severity (defined as the Pitt bacteraemia score greater than or equal 
to 2) were age, sex, Charleston co-morbidity index, where infection was acquired and 
sites of infection. Using the Pitt bacteraemia score as the outcome measure, univariate 
and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed and odds ratios, 
confidence intervals and p-values reported. The regression analysis investigated the 
association for the patients so we used generalised estimating equations (GEE) to 
account for any patients with multiple bacteraemia episodes.

Results: 
594 bacteraemic episodes occurred in 500 patients who were divided according to Pitt 
scores (table I). The majority of bacteraemic episodes occurred both in patients aged > 
50, 382/594 (64.3%), and males, 346/594 (58.2%). Episodes were roughly distributed 
between community-acquired, health care associated and hospital-acquired 
infections. Community-acquired bacteraemia was not associated with severe sepsis 
(Pitt score greater than or equal to 2). The commonest bacteraemic isolates were 
Escherichia coli 207/594 (34.8%) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus 57/594 
(9.6%). Patient speciality and site of infection, in particular critical care admission and 
catheter associated UTIs, were significantly associated with severity. Patient outcomes 
were significantly associated with severity and, in a subgroup of patients with a Pitt 
score greater than or equal to 2, mortality at 7-days was 6.0% (95% CI 3.0, 10.5) and 
inpatient mortality 8.7% (95% CI 5.1, 13.7) respectively.  
Gram negative isolates were significantly associated with severe sepsis (table 1). There 
were significant differences in susceptibility profiles (table II). Co-amoxiclav 
resistance, meropenem resistance and ESBL production were significantly associated 
with severe sepsis. There was no association with aminoglycoside resistance.   
Logistic regression analysis is summarised in table III. Site of infection was 
significantly associated with severe infection in multivariate analysis. In particular, 
this association was strongest for catheter associated UTI, (OR 3.87, 95% CIs 1.82, 8.22) 
 13 
 
and this association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, CCI and where 
infection was acquired, (OR 3.94, 95% CIs 1.70, 9.11).

Discussion:  
In a bacteraemic cohort, after adjustment for age, sex, CCI and where infection was 
acquired, we demonstrated that site of infection, in particular catheter associated 
UTIs, was associated with severe sepsis. This is an important finding as device related 
infections are potentially preventable. 
The strength of this study was that the Pitt score (a severity index) was used as the 
primary outcome rather than mortality, although both are strongly associated. At 
presentation, confusion, haemodynamic instability and tachypnoea are included in 
new guidance for recognition of severe sepsis (7). Uniquely, our data suggests that the 
presence of a urinary catheter is a predictor of severe sepsis and, therefore, at the 
earliest signs of sepsis, consideration should be given to immediate admission to 
hospital or, for inpatients, management in a critical care area.  
Few studies have examined risk factors for severe sepsis in bacteraemic patients. In a 
Spanish cohort of community-onset bacteraemic UTIs from eight tertiary hospitals, 
risk factors associated with severe sepsis were fatal underlying disease, history of 
urinary obstruction and indwelling urinary catheters (11). In multivariate logistic 
regression analysis, urinary catheterisation remained a significant risk factor for 
patients without fatal underlying disease. In patients with E. coli bacteraemia, 
associations with severe sepsis are variable. In a 12 month prospective cohort study in 
two French University hospitals, one paper describes no host determinants 
influencing severity of sepsis at presentation although bacterial and host determinants 
 15 
 
both influenced outcomes significantly (12). In another prospective French 
multicentre cohort study involving 1051 patients from 14 University Hospitals, age, 
liver cirrhosis, hospitalisation before bacteraemia and portal of entry were 
significantly associated with mortality, although no mention was made of urinary 
catheters (13). 
Our study is of particular relevance following NHS England’s initiative to reduce E. 
coli bacteraemias (14). An important part of this strategy is a reduction in urinary 
catheter associated bacteraemias, and our study suggests this is an important priority 
as not only are some of these infections preventable, but they are also associated with 
severe sepsis. Across the NHS there is a need for a systematic care bundle approach 
to urinary catheterisation (15), in particular documented reasons for insertion, 
anticipated date of removal and adherence to aseptic technique at insertion and 
during after-care. Patients with long term catheters should all receive catheter 
passports, community nurses should have access to guidance on the use of 
prophylactic antibiotics when changing catheters and some patients may benefit from 
suprapubic catheterisation, which is associated with less infection compared to 
urethral catheterisation (16). Even so, if a 20% reduction in bacteraemic catheter 
associated UTIs was achieved (17), this may not be sufficient in itself to achieve an 
overall 10% reduction in E. coli bacteraemias (18) for which a CQUIN payment will be 
available in 2016/17. However, this could have a significant impact on hospital 
admissions due to severe sepsis, including admission to critical care units.     
 16 
 
There was an association between Gram-negative multiple drug resistance and severe 
sepsis. There is little in the literature to suggest that multiple drug resistant organisms 
are intrinsically more virulent, and it would appear more plausible that the association 
with severity was a consequence of delay in appropriate antibiotic administration due 
to unanticipated resistance (19). 
There were limitations to this study. A larger cohort may have identified other host 
risk factors associated with severe sepsis, although this study was sufficiently 
powered to demonstrate a strong association with urinary catheterisation. Our 
findings apply to a bacteraemic cohorts, and it is not clear whether they are applicable 
to other severe sepsis cohorts without bacteraemia.  
We demonstrated that in the context of sepsis, the presence of a urinary catheter 
should prompt immediate referral to A&E, implementation of ‘sepsis 6’ and, for 
inpatients, consideration of transfer to a critical care unit to optimise management. It 
should also increase awareness that unless there is a good reason, urinary catheters 
should not be inserted, a care bundle approach should be used, and when they are 
inserted a removal date anticipated unless long term catheterisation is required. A 
standardised approach across all UK NHS trusts is likely to contribute to a reduction 
in the incidence of severe sepsis and E. coli bacteraemia, two key elements of NHS 
England’s strategy to improve patient safety and better utilise hospital beds.
