The Relationship Between Oseltamivir and Suicide  
in Pediatric Patients
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Studies examining the association between use of oseltamivir and neu-
ropsychiatric events (including suicide) among children have had mixed findings 
and have been limited by small sample size, reliance on older data, and potential 
confounding. We undertook an analysis that addresses these limitations.
METHODS Using a national administrative claims database and a case-crossover 
design that minimized confounding, we analyzed data from 5 contemporary 
influenza seasons (2009-2013) for individuals aged 1 to 18 years and ascertained 
oseltamivir exposure from pharmacy dispensing.
RESULTS We identified 21,407 suicide-related events during this study period, 
251 of which were in oseltamivir-exposed children. In case-crossover analysis, we 
did not find any significant association with suicide either for oseltamivir expo-
sure (odds ratio 
= 
0.64; 95% CI, 0.39-1.00; P 
= 
.05) or for influenza diagnosis 
alone (odds ratio 
= 
0.63; 95% CI, 0.34-1.08; P 
= 
.10).
CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that oseltamivir does not increase risk of sui-
cide in the pediatric population.

INTRODUCTION
O
seltamivir is an antiviral agent used to treat influenza types A 
and B. Originally approved in 1999, it is routinely prescribed 
in pediatric practice. About 4 in 10 oseltamivir prescriptions 
dispensed in the United States between 2005 and 2011 were to children 
aged 16 years or younger.1
Case reports from the early 2000s raised concerns regarding the 
potential for psychiatric adverse events in children being given oseltami-
vir. Reported events included abnormal behavior, psychosis, and suicide, 
resulting in a change to the package insert in 2006 to include the risk of 
these events.2 Published evidence of this association is not consistent, how-
ever. Secondary analyses of randomized controlled trials among pediatric 
patients and some observational cohort studies have not found an asso-
ciation.3-5 Case reports, observational studies, and analyses of the Food 
and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System do suggest a 
potential risk, however.6-8
Prior US observational studies of a link between oseltamivir and sui-
cide have examined older data (through the early 2000s) or a single influ-
enza season, and have included suicide only as a secondary outcome.4,5 
Moreover, these studies’ designs were unable to account for important 
clinical and sociodemographic variables, suggesting that findings may have 
been influenced by unmeasured confounding. 
The main objective of this study was to assess whether there is an 
association between oseltamivir and suicide attempt in pediatric patients 
using data from more recent influenza seasons and a novel study design to 
address confounding concerns. We also assessed influenza alone as a pos-
sible confounding risk factor for pediatric suicide.

METHODS
We used a case-crossover design, whereby individual 
cases serve as their own control, to minimize con-
founding.9 Five influenza seasons (2009-2013), defined 
as October 1 of one year through April 30 of the sub-
sequent year, were examined.
The study was conducted using the Truven Mar-
ketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database, 
an administrative claims database consisting of 50 mil-
lion beneficiaries across all 50 states.10 The University 
of Illinois Institutional Review Board determined that 
the study did not met the definition of human subjects 
research, and it was therefore exempted.
Inclusion criteria were an age of 1 to 18 years at 
the time of the suicide-related event (index), 6 months 
of prior continuous enrollment, and an inpatient or 
outpatient suicide diagnosis during the influenza sea-
son. Children were allowed to contribute to multiple 
influenza seasons. A suicide-related event was defined 
as presence of a first suicide-related International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-
9-CM) code of E, denoting external cause of injury, or 
a code of V62.84, Suicidal Ideation.4
We ascertained oseltamivir exposure from out-
patient pharmacy dispensing and exposure duration 
from the number of days supplied that was listed in the 
claim. For each patient, we assigned the 10-day period 
immediately before the index event as the case period, 
and we identified up to 4 earlier control periods of the 
same length (Figure 1). As in case-control studies that 
match a single case to many controls, we used multiple 
control periods to improve precision (eg, obtain tighter 
CIs) and our ability to detect a potential effect.11 Con-
trol periods were selected from the same influenza 
season as the case period, with the number of control 
periods determined by the time available between start 
of the season and the event date. Exposure status was 
determined in both case and control periods. Dura-
tions of the case and control periods were selected 
based on typical oseltamivir dosing and half-life. In 
sensitivity analyses, the exposure and control periods 
were reduced (5-day exposure and control periods, 10 
days of washout), and expanded (15-day exposure and 
control periods, 15 days of washout). We conducted 
an additional sensitivity analysis restricting the eligible 
event period to January 1 through March 31 of each 
influenza season to examine the effect of case-event 
timing during the season.
An observed association between oseltamivir and 
suicide could potentially be confounded by underly-
ing influenza infection. To evaluate such potential 
confounding by indication, we performed a secondary 
analysis using influenza diagnosis alone (without osel-
tamivir use) as the exposure. The duration of influenza 
exposure was set at 7 days.
We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confi-
dence intervals for the effects of oseltamivir (vs no 
oseltamivir) and influenza (vs no influenza) using 
conditional logistic regression analysis. Because of 
the case-based design, it was not necessary to adjust 
for covariates in this analysis. Results were stratified 
by hypothesized effect modifiers, measured over the 
6-month baseline period before the event. Data man-
agement and analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 
(SAS Institute).
RESULTS
We identified 21,047 individuals aged 1 to 18 years 
who attempted suicide during the study period and 
qualified for the analysis; of those, 251 were exposed to 
oseltamivir at the time. The mean age of this exposed

group was approximately 15 years, and 
61% were female. Underlying mental 
health diagnoses were common (65%).
In the primary analysis, the odds 
ratio of oseltamivir exposure during the 
case period before the event was 0.64 
(95% CI, 0.39-1.00; P = .05) (Table 1).
In the secondary analysis, we identi-
fied 162 individuals aged 1 to 18 years 
exposed only to influenza. Their char-
acteristics were similar to those of the 
oseltamivir-exposed group. The odds 
ratio for suicide attempt for influenza-
only exposure, vs no influenza, during 
the case period was 0.63 (95% CI, 
0.34-1.08; P = .10).
Effect estimates from sensitivity 
analyses that examined alternative case 
and control time periods were similar 
in magnitude and direction to those 
of the primary analysis. Two findings 
were statistically significant: a 15-day 
window analysis of oseltamivir expo-
sure (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.86; 
P = .007) and a 5-day window analysis 
of influenza-only exposure (OR = 0.48; 
CI, 0.22-0.95; P = .03). Estimates from 
analysis restricting the eligible event 
period to January 1 through March 31 
of each influenza season were also in 
the same direction as those of the pri-
mary analysis.
DISCUSSION
We did not find a significantly 
increased risk between suicide-related 
events and the use of oseltamivir. This 
result is consistent with those from pre-
vious studies that used different study 
designs, and contrasts with the warning 
in the package insert.2,4,5 The associa-
tion for influenza-only exposure was of 
similar direction and magnitude as that 
for oseltamivir exposure, suggesting no 
confounding by indication of underly-
ing influenza.
The findings of our study did not 
change in the sensitivity analyses. 
Although we found a statistically significant reduction 
in risk with some alternative case and control time 
periods, results should be interpreted with caution. 
For instance, the 15-day window analysis of oseltami-
vir, although biologically plausible, extends the drug’s 
effect duration to its extreme. This extension may lead 
to an exaggeration of the effect due to misclassification 
of the case period as “exposed.”
By leveraging the case-crossover design, we were 
able to account for within-person confounders (eg,

trauma, abuse, and baseline psychiatric status) and 
time-invariant confounders (eg, race), irrespective of 
their availability in the data. This design addresses 
drawbacks of previous studies examining neuropsychi-
atric effects of oseltamivir. 
Our results are subject to a number of limitations, 
however. Suicide-related events may be underidenti-
fied, as claims data capture only events that result in 
a billed medical encounter. Patients with recorded 
events may be less likely to use health care in the days 
immediately preceding the event, potentially result-
ing in the observed null effect. Although case reports 
suggest a possible higher oseltamivir-related risk in the 
Asian population, we were unable to examine effect 
modification by race because the data set does not 
capture this characteristic. Our decision to define the 
influenza season according to the same dates across 
years, while unlikely to introduce bias into the study 
results, does not reflect the true variability in season 
duration and may have artificially restricted our sam-
ple size. Finally, although we made multiple compari-
sons, we did not make corrections for multiple testing. 
As the main study finding was the lack of significant 
effect, we do not believe the use of a more conserva-
tive alpha would change the interpretation of study 
results. This possibility highlights the importance of 
considering effect size and CIs, however, when assess-
ing potential harms. 
Despite the above limitations, our results suggest 
that oseltamivir does not increase the risk of suicide in 
the pediatric population.
