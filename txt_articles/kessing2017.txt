IMPORTANCE Results from animal and human studies suggest that lithium in therapeutic
doses may improve learning and memory and modify the risk of developing dementia.
Additional preliminary studies suggest that subtherapeutic levels, including microlevels of
lithium, may influence human cognition.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the incidence of dementia in the general population
covaries with long-term exposure to microlevels of lithium in drinking water.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This Danish nationwide, population-based, nested
case-control study examined longitudinal, individual geographic data on municipality of
residence and data from drinking water measurements combined with time-specific data
from all patients aged 50 to 90 years with a hospital contact with a diagnosis of dementia
from January 1, 1970, through December 31, 2013, and 10 age- and sex-matched control
individuals from the Danish population. The mean lithium exposure in drinking water since
1986 was estimated for all study individuals. Data analysis was performed from January 1,
1995, through December 31, 2013.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A diagnosis of dementia in a hospital inpatient or outpatient
contact. Diagnoses of Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia were secondary outcome
measures. In primary analyses, distribution of lithium exposure was compared between
patients with dementia and controls.
RESULTS A total of 73 731 patients with dementia and 733 653 controls (median age, 80.3
years; interquartile range, 74.9-84.6 years; 44 760 female [60.7%] and 28 971 male [39.3%])
were included in the study. Lithium exposure was statistically significantly different between
patients with a diagnosis of dementia (median, 11.5 μg/L; interquartile range, 6.5-14.9 μg/L)
and controls (median, 12.2 μg/L; interquartile range, 7.3-16.0 μg/L; P < .001). A nonlinear
association was observed. Compared with individuals exposed to 2.0 to 5.0 μg/L, the
incidence rate ratio (IRR) of dementia was decreased in those exposed to more than 15.0 μg/L
(IRR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81-0.85; P < .001) and 10.1 to 15.0 μg/L (IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-1.01;
P = .17) and increased with 5.1 to 10.0 μg/L (IRR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.19-1.25; P < .001). Similar
patterns were found with Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia as outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Long-term increased lithium exposure in drinking water may
be associated with a lower incidence of dementia in a nonlinear way; however, confounding
from other factors associated with municipality of residence cannot be excluded.

Methods
The Registers
Data were obtained by linking Danish population–based reg-
isters using unique personal identification numbers, which are
assigned to all 5.6 million persons living in Denmark.16 Data
on municipality of residence are available at Statistics Den-
mark at an individual level for all individuals in Denmark from
1986onward.17DatafromStatisticsDenmark17werelinkedwith
data on diagnoses and corresponding dates from the Danish
National Patient Register (DNPR)18 and the Danish Psychiat-
ricCentralResearchRegister(DPCRR)19anddatesofdeathfrom
the Danish Register of Causes of Death.20 The DPCRR19 con-
tains data from 1970 onward, and the DNPR21 contains data
from January 1, 1977, onward. The registers include data from
all inpatients treated at psychiatric and somatic hospitals in
Denmark. They also include data on outpatients from Janu-
ary 1, 1995, onward as a part of the official Danish health
survey.21 Since January 1994, the International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Re-
vision (ICD-10) has been in use in both registers.22 The Danish
RegisterofCausesofDeath23containsdataondeath.Thestudy
was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency. Accord-
ing to Danish law and the National Board of Health, informed
consent is not necessary in register-based research. Register-
based data are deidentified.
Selection of Cases
All patients with a hospital contact with a diagnosis of demen-
tia as an inpatient or outpatient were identified in the DNPR
(ICD-10 code DF F00-19 + G30.0–G30.9) and in the DPCRR
(ICD-10codeDFF00-19)forthestudyperiodofJanuary1,1995,
through December 31, 2013. Patients in the registers with a di-
agnosis of dementia before entry into the study and back to
January 1, 1977 (for the DNPR), and 1970 (for the DPCRR) were
excluded (ICD-8 codes 290-290.19, ICD-10 codes F00-09 and
G30.0–G30.9). The date of first diagnosis is referred to as the
index date. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 1995,
through December 31, 2013.
ThevalidityofthediagnosisofdementiaintheDanishhos-
pital registers is high because a registered diagnosis of demen-
tia was found to be correct, fulfilling ICD-10 and/or DSM-IV cri-
teria for dementia in 169 of 197 (85.8%) randomly selected
inpatients and outpatients from the DNPR and the DPCRR
based on a systematic review and scoring system of patients’
medical journals, including history of dementia illness, cog-
nitive test results, psychiatric evaluation findings, blood test
results, electrocardiography findings, findings from com-
putedtomographyormagneticresonanceimagingofthebrain,
physical examination (including vital signs and neurologic ex-
amination)results,andevaluationofactivitiesofdailyliving.24
However, with regard to dementia subtypes, the degree of
agreement between the registers and the results of the vali-
dating process was low (κ = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24-0.48).24

Key Points
Question Is a higher lithium level in drinking water associated
with a decreased incidence of dementia?
Findings In this Danish nationwide, population-based, nested
case-control study of 73 731 patients with dementia and 733 653
control individuals, the level of lithium exposure was lower for
patients with a diagnosis of dementia than for controls. Similar
patterns were found with Alzheimer disease and vascular
dementia as outcomes.
Meaning Exposure to higher long-term lithium levels in drinking
water may be associated with a lower incidence of dementia.

cludedfromallanalysesifnoinformationonmunicipalityofresi-
dence was available between 1986 and the index date.
Lithium Exposure Assessment
Drinking water samples from 151 waterworks taken from 2009
to 2010 and 2013, supplying approximately 42% of the Dan-
ish population, were used to estimate the lithium drinking
water level for the entire country based on the kriging inter-
polation method.25-27 On the basis of the kriging map, a time-
constant mean lithium level in each of the 275 municipalities
in Denmark was calculated.26 Kriging is based on spatial au-
tocorrelation estimates obtained by fitting a semivariogram.
Different semivariograms were used to evaluate the effect of
the selected spatial autocorrelation estimates on the esti-
mated kriging map. Furthermore, inverse distance weighting
was used as an alternative interpolation method. Different
semivariograms used for the kriging and inverse distance
weighting resulted in similar maps (details are described in the
article by Knudsen et al26). The Danish municipality to which
the home address of a study participant (patient with demen-
tia or control) belonged in a certain year was obtained for all
years from 1986 to the index date. Thus, analyses accounted
for whether individuals moved from one municipality to an-
other, resulting in a change of exposure to lithium in drinking
water. This information was used to compute the participant-
specific mean level of lithium in drinking water according to
the addresses of all study individuals in the study period (de-
tails are described in the article by Knudsen et al26).
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed among individuals aged 50 to 90
years. In the primary analyses, the distribution of lithium ex-
posure was compared between patients with dementia and
controls.Theassociationbetweenexposuretolithiumindrink-
ing water and the incidence rate of dementia was estimated
using a Cox proportional hazards regression model fitted to the
nested case-control sample,28 providing incidence rate ratios
(IRRs) of dementia with 95% CIs. In this analysis, the mean ex-
posure to lithium in drinking water was categorized into 4
groups(2.0-5.0,5.1-10.0,10.1-15.0,and15.1-27.0μg/L).Thelow-
est group (2.0-5.0 μg/L) was used as a reference for the IRR cal-
culations. A sensitivity analysis was performed in which the
continuous association between the mean lithium level in
drinking water and the IRR of dementia was analyzed by using
restricted cubic splines with 5 knots set at the quantiles of the
mean lithium exposure in drinking water.29
Bysamplingcontrolsfromtherisksetatthedatesofdemen-
tia diagnosis and by matching for age, we determined that the
association between mean lithium exposure and dementia IRR
canbeinterpretedasIRRsbetweenindividualslivingconstantly

tal or capital suburb [reference], provincial city with <100 000

Results
After excluding patients with a prior diagnosis of dementia,
74 100 patients aged 50 to 90 years were identified with a di-
agnosisofdementiaduringthestudyperiodfrom1995through
2013. Municipality of residence was missing in the entire study
period for 0.30% of patients and 0.49% of matched controls,
leaving 73 731 patients with dementia and 733 653 controls for
the analyses (median age, 80.3 years; interquartile range [IQR],
74.9-84.6 years; 44 760 female [60.7%] and 28 971 male
[39.3%]). A total of 9038 participants (12.3%) were 50 to 70
years of age, 26 420 (35.8%) were 70 to 80 years of age, and
38 273 (51.9%) were 80 to 90 years of age.
The mean (SD) lithium level in drinking water was 11.6
(6.8)μg/L,rangingfrom0.6μg/LinwesternDenmarkto30.7μg/L
ineasternDenmark.Theinterpolationofthepointdatarendered
estimated lithium levels for each of the 275 municipalities.
The distributions of the mean lithium exposure were sta-
tistically significantly different among patients with a diag-
nosis of dementia (median, 11.5 μg/L; IQR, 6.5-14.9 μg/L) and
among controls (median, 12.2 μg/L; IQR, 7.3-16.0 μg/L;
P < .001). The Table indicates that when mean lithium intake
was categorized in the Cox proportional hazards regression
models, the IRR of dementia was decreased among individu-
als exposed to 10.1 μg/L of lithium or more compared with ex-
posure to 2.0 to 5.0 μg/L, reaching statistical significance only
among individuals exposed to more than 15.0 μg/L of lithium
(IRR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81-0.85; P < .001) compared with 2.0 to
5.0 μg/L. However, exposure to 5.1 to 10.0 μg/L of lithium was
associated with an increased IRR of dementia compared with
2.0 to 5.0 μg/L (IRR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.19-1.25; P < .001). This non-
linearpatternwasunchangedwhentheanalysesexcludeddata
for individuals with partly missing information on municipal-
ity of residence (IRR for 5.1-10.0 μg/L, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.20-1.26;
IRR for 10.1-15.0 μg/L, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1.01; and IRR for 15.1-
27.0 μg/L, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.85). In addition, the pattern
was confirmed when the analysis was adjusted for urbanicity
of residence (IRR for 5.1-10.0 μg/L, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15-1.21; IRR
for 10.1-15.0 μg/L, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.05; and IRR for 15.1-
27.0 μg/L, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.85-0.91). In the latter model, there
was a direct inverse association with urbanicity (with resi-
dence capital or capital suburb as the reference; IRR for pro-
vincial city, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.99-1.06; IRR for provincial town,
1.36; 95% CI, 1.33-1.40; and IRR for rural areas, 1.17; 95% CI,
1.14-1.20). Furthermore, this pattern was repeated when Alz-
heimer disease or vascular dementia was an outcome.
The Figure shows the restricted cubic spline analysis of the
continuous association in relation to dementia overall. The ref-
erence for the IRRs was set at a mean of 4 μg/L.

 Discussion
Overall, we confirmed the hypothesis that higher long-term
lithium exposure from drinking water may be associated with a
lowerincidenceofdementia,althoughtheassociationwasnon-
linear(TableandFigure).Thisisthefirststudy,toourknowledge,

The study was a nationwide, population-based, nested case-
control study that included individualized longitudinal data on

pital data on incident dementia in an up to 19-year outcome pe-
riod(1995-2013).Inthisway,thestudytookintoaccountwhether
individuals moved from one municipality to another, resulting
in a change of lithium exposure in drinking water. Thus, in con-
trast to prior ecologic studies32,33 on lithium in drinking water
andtheassociationwithvariousoutcomes,suchassuicide,the
present study used individualized data on lithium exposure in
drinkingwaterlinkedindividuallywithadiagnosisofdementia.
Furthermore,thestudyincludedallpatientswithincidentcases

wideand10controlspercasewithoutahospitalcontactwithde-
mentia. The validity of the diagnosis of dementia in the Danish
hospitalregistersishigh,24andalthoughthehospitalregistersin-
clude data on diagnosis from secondary care only, the age- and
sex-specific incidence of dementia is comparable to the results
fromtheEuropeandigitalelevationmodel(EuroDEM).34,35Inour
study,theassociationsbetweenlong-termlithiumexposureand
theincidenceofdementiawererepeatedwhenAlzheimerdisease
or vascular dementia was selected as an outcome, although the
validityofdementiasubtypesinthehospitalregistersislower.34
In addition to vegetables, drinking water is a major source
of human lithium intake.36 The levels of lithium in ground-
water and drinking water are most likely stable over time be-
cause of the chemical properties of lithium and its slow leach-
ingintotheground.26Thegeographicvariationoflithiumlevels
in Danish groundwater ranges from approximately 2 μg/L in
some areas to nearly 30 μg/L in others.26 Higher levels may oc-
cur in groundwater aquifers that are in contact with marine
sediments.37 Compared with drinking water in other regions
of the world, the lithium levels observed in Danish drinking
water are significantly lower and the range is generally more
narrow36; on a European scale, the levels are slightly higher
than observed medians and means according to lithium sta-
tisticsfrommorethan500drinkingwatersamplesinEurope.38
Limitations
Wedidnotadjustouranalysesforaccessibilitytohealthcareser-
vices that vary geographically and may influence the probabil-
ityofdiagnosisofdementia,specificallyduringearlystages.Nev-
ertheless, accessibility to health care services is increased in
eastern regions of Denmark, where lithium levels generally are
higher,anddecreasedinwesternregions,specificallyinJutland,
where lithium levels generally are lower (ie, not taking account
of accessibility to health care services in the analyses may tend
tounderestimatetheassociationbetweenlithiumindrinkingwa-
ter and incidence of dementia). However, in a sensitivity analy-
sis, we adjusted the model for urbanicity of residence, finding
a direct inverse association with increasing risk of dementia in
ruralareasincontrasttopriorfindingsofincreasedriskofschizo-
phrenia in urban areas.30 Furthermore, because all inhabitants

 to2013,althoughtheleveloflithiumingroundwateranddrink-
ing water is most likely stable over time because of the chemi-
cal properties of lithium and its slow release from the soil and
sediment.25,26,40 Accordingly, a previous comparison25 includ-
ing data from the same waterworks 4 years apart (2009-2013)
suggestedthatlithiumlevelswereroughlystableovertimeand
thattherewasnolithiumremovalorenrichmentduringthetreat-
ment at the waterworks.
Nonlinear dose-response associations are often found in
medicine,withagradualincreaseindrugresponseatthelower
doses and gradual leveling off in response at the highest doses.
Bell-shaped response curves, occasionally with multiple
modes, have been observed in some of the microdose non-
lithium neuroprotective literature,41 presumably reflecting the
engagement of one neuroprotective mechanism of action fol-
lowed by its loss as the dose is increased, only to engage an-
othermechanismasthedoseisfurtherincreased.Similardose-
response associations may pertain to the nonlinear findings
in our study (Table and Figure).
Our findings agree with results of the 2 longer-term ran-
domized clinical trials on lithium in subtherapeutic doses pro-
ducing stabilizing effects among individuals with mild cogni-
tiveimpairmenttreatedwithlowdosesoflithium(150-600mg)
for 2 years14 and patients with Alzheimer disease treated with
a microdose of 300 μg of lithium for 15 months.15 However, 2
small short-term randomized clinical trials of adults with mild
to moderate Alzheimer disease did not observe a protective ef-
fect of lithium in therapeutic doses during 16 and 10 weeks,
respectively,42,43 probably because of high dropout rates asso-
ciatedwithlithiumtreatmentathigherlevels;thefindingssug-
gest that longer-term exposure with subtherapeutic lithium
doses may be necessary to reveal a protective effect.
Although studies on the effects of microdoses of lithium
are controversial, observations suggest that biological effects
of long-term microdoses of lithium are relevant in the patho-
genesis of Alzheimer disease. For example, long-term treat-
ment with lithium at subtherapeutic doses can modify the se-
cretionofproinflammatoryandanti-inflammatoryinterleukins
in cocultures of cortical and hippocampal neurons with glial
cells.44 Furthermore, long-term microdoses of lithium have
compared with higher doses—a more prominent effect on
membrane homeostasis (which may be disturbed in Alzhei-
mer disease)—by activating forms of cytosolic phospholipase
A2andcalcium-independentphospholipaseA2inprimarycul-
tures of cortical and hippocampal neurons.45 In addition, rats
exposed to long-term (100 days) treatment with 125 mg/L of
lithium in drinking water, which resulted in low mean (SD)
blood lithium levels (0.1 [0.019] mEq/L), experienced acti-
vated brain phospholipase A2; this activation is required for
memory retrieval and improved memory.46
Other arguments that support the view that microlevels
of lithium may affect human behavior derive from prior cross-
sectionalstudies32,33basedonecologic,nonindividualizeddata
that report that levels of lithium in drinking water correlate in-
versely with the rate of suicide and from a preliminary study47
ontheeffectsofnutritionallithiumsupplementationonmood.
However, a newly conducted Danish study,26 which used in-
dividualized data as the present study did, did not confirm the
protective effect of exposure to lithium in drinking water and
the risk of suicide.
No brain imaging studies have been published on the ef-
fects of microlevels of lithium on brain functioning. Never-
theless, there is level 1 evidence of a positive association be-
tween lithium treatment in therapeutic doses and brain gray
matter volume in multiple brain regions of relevance for Alz-
heimer disease, including hippocampus, amygdala, anterior
cingulate, subgenual cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, post-
central gyrus, and habenula.48
Conclusions
Long-termincreasedexposuretolithiumindrinkingwatermay
be associated with a lower incidence of dementia in a nonlin-
ear way. However, confounding from other factors associ-
ated with municipality of residence cannot be excluded.
