Patricia was a late-season major hurricane that intensified at a rate rarely observed 
in a tropical cyclone.  It became a category 5 hurricane (on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane 
Wind Scale) over anomalously warm waters to the south of Mexico, and the strongest 
hurricane on record in the eastern North Pacific and North Atlantic basins. The hurricane 
turned north-northeastward and weakened substantially before making landfall along a 
sparsely populated part of the coast of southwestern Mexico as a category 4 hurricane.  
Patricia produced a narrow swath of severe damage and two direct deaths.

SYNOPTIC HISTORY 
 
     
Patricia’s development into a tropical cyclone was slow and complicated, involving the 
interaction of multiple weather systems.  A tropical disturbance crossed the southern part of 
Central America on 11 October, and entered the eastern Pacific the following day several hundred 
nautical miles south of El Salvador.  While this system moved little, a tropical wave was moving 
westward over the Caribbean Sea, and reached Central America on 15 October.  The wave 
moved into the eastern Pacific the next day and merged with the first disturbance while a Gulf of 
Tehuantepec gap wind event was occurring.  The gap wind event provided an injection of cyclonic 
vorticity to the merged disturbance (Levine 2012, Holbach and Bourassa 2014), and an elongated 
area of low pressure formed later that day, extending from the Yucatan Peninsula southward for 
several hundred miles into the eastern Pacific.  Deep convection associated with the large 
cyclonic gyre increased substantially on 17 October, possibly due to more favorable large-scale 
conditions associated with the passage of the rising branch of a strong Madden-Julian Oscillation 
moving eastward across the eastern Pacific.  
The system’s cloud pattern was gradually becoming better organized while it moved slowly 
northwestward to a position a few hundred nautical miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on 18 
October, where it developed a smaller and better defined circulation.  However, a second gap 
wind event, stronger than the first, began later that day.  Although this gap wind event initially had 
a disruptive effect on the formative tropical cyclone, the low reformed to the northeast later on 19 
October on the cyclonic shear side of the strengthening gap wind event.  Deep convection 
associated with the low increased and became well organized by early on 20 October.  An ASCAT 
pass around 0400 UTC 20 October suggested that a small, well-defined circulation had developed 
underneath the convection within a larger cyclonic envelope elongated from north to south, and it 
is estimated that a tropical depression finally formed around 0600 UTC that day centered about 
180 n mi south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. The “best track” chart of the tropical cyclone’s 
path is given in Fig. 1, with the wind and pressure histories shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.  
The best track positions and intensities are listed in Table 12. 
 
The depression was located to the south of a mid-level ridge centered over the Gulf of 
Mexico, extending west-southwestward into the eastern Pacific.  The steering provided by this 
feature and the gap wind event caused the depression to drift west-southwestward while the 
cyclone gradually strengthened, and the system became a tropical storm 18 h after genesis.  By 
early on 21 October Patricia encountered relatively drier and more stable lower- to middle-
tropospheric air, and sea surface temperatures that were at least 2º C lower than the surrounding

years’ data are located in the archive directory.

region, the result of strong gap winds over a large area extending well to the south of the Isthmus 
of Tehuantepec. The less favorable thermodynamic environment slowed development, with deep 
convection temporarily diminishing and cloud-top temperatures warming late on 20 October and 
early on 21 October.  Once Patricia moved outside of the affected region later that morning, 
however, a rapid increase in deep convection occurred over the low-level center, and a small 
central dense overcast (CDO) began to form while the storm moved at a faster forward speed 
toward the west and then the west-northwest.  A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft reached Patricia 
that afternoon and discovered it to already be a 50-kt tropical storm, consistent with the rapid 
increase in organization of the cloud pattern seen in satellite imagery.   A period of rapid 
intensification had already begun in an environment of very light vertical wind shear, high 
atmospheric moisture and greater instability over anomalously warm waters, untapped since 
Hurricane Carlos traversed the region in June.  Patricia strengthened into a hurricane shortly after 
0000 UTC 22 October while centered about 200 n mi south of Acapulco, Mexico.    
 
Over the next 24 h, Patricia’s satellite presentation changed dramatically, as a large band 
with cloud-top temperatures of -80º to -90º C coiling cyclonically inward over the center evolved 
into an almost perfectly symmetric CDO around a 10 n mi wide eye.  A NOAA plane arrived at the 
end of this 24-h period around 1800 UTC 22 October, and indicated that Patricia had already 
reached major hurricane strength, with estimated surface winds of 115 kt and a minimum pressure 
of 957 mb. The rapid intensification phase continued into the night while Patricia turned 
northwestward and its forward speed decreased, and satellite imagery indicated that a solid ring 
of cloud-top temperatures colder than -90º C surrounding a 7 n mi wide eye had formed by 0300 
UTC 23 October (cover figure).  By the time an Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft reached the 
cyclone around 0600 UTC, Patricia had intensified into an extremely powerful hurricane with 
maximum sustained winds of 180 kt and a minimum central pressure of around 879 mb.  The 
satellite presentation continued to increase in organization over the next several hours after the 
plane left, and Patricia is estimated to have reached a peak intensity of 185 kt around 1200 UTC 
that day while centered about 130 n mi southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. 
Patricia reached the western periphery of the mid-level ridge centered over the Gulf of 
Mexico around this time and turned north-northwestward and then northward while essentially 
maintaining its intensity.  By the time the last reconnaissance mission reached Patricia around 
1800 UTC 23 October, the hurricane had turned north-northeastward with some increase in 
forward speed, in response to a shortwave trough moving across the Baja California peninsula 
and northwestern Mexico.  Although the aircraft still found surface winds of near 180 kt on its first 
pass through the storm in the southeastern quadrant, a 2023 UTC Global Precipitation Mission 
(GPM) overpass indicated a distinct double eyewall structure (Fig. 4), suggestive of an imminent 
weakening trend. Upper-air analyses also indicated that southwesterly vertical wind shear was 
gradually increasing over the cyclone, and a final pass by the plane around 2030 UTC indicated 
that a rapid filling of the cyclone had begun; the peak flight-level winds had decreased nearly 50 
kt in the same quadrant traversed earlier and the central pressure had risen 24 mb in the 3 h 
since the first fix.    
Patricia continued to rapidly weaken during the next couple of hours before landfall, and 
is estimated to have reached the southwestern coast of Mexico in the state of Jalisco, near Playa 
Cuixmala, around 2300 UTC 23 October with an intensity of 130 kt and a minimum pressure of 
around 932 mb.  The hurricane continued to weaken rapidly during the next several hours while 
 Hurricane Patricia     4 
 
it moved over the high terrain of the Sierra Madre mountains, and Patricia fell below hurricane 
strength before passing well to the west of Guadalajara around 0300 UTC 24 October.  When the 
mid-level center raced northeastward and separated from the low-level center overnight, Patricia 
weakened to a tropical depression.  The cyclone dissipated later that morning over central Mexico. 
 
METEOROLOGICAL STATISTICS 
 
  
Observations in Patricia (Figs. 2 and 3) include subjective satellite-based Dvorak 
technique intensity estimates from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB) and the 
Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), and objective Advanced Dvorak Technique (ADT) estimates from 
the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies/University of Wisconsin-Madison.  
Observations also include flight-level, stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR), and 
dropwindsonde observations from three flights of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron of 
the U. S. Air Force Reserve Command and one NOAA Aircraft Operations Center WP-3D aircraft. 
A NASA WB-57 aircraft flying at high altitude provided useful dropsonde data on Patricia’s 
intensity on 21 October.  Data and imagery from NOAA polar-orbiting satellites including the 
Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), the NASA Global Precipitation Mission (GPM), the 
European Space Agency’s Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and Defense Meteorological 
Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites, among others, were also useful in constructing the best track 
of Patricia. 
There were no reliable ship reports of winds of tropical storm force associated with 
Patricia.  Selected surface observations from land stations are given in Table 2. 
The highest flight-level wind obtained during Patricia, 192 kt, was measured by an Air 
Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft at 0647 UTC 23 October in the northeastern eyewall, 
and a wind of 191 kt was measured on a NOAA mission at 1734 UTC that day.  The maximum 
SFMR-observed surface wind was 182 kt at 0600 UTC, and a value of 180 kt was measured on 
the later flight at 1732 UTC (Fig. 5).   SFMR data from both flights were reprocessed, and 
confirmed to be reliable after an evaluation by NOAA Hurricane Research Division staff (Klotz 
2015, personal communication). The reprocessing yielded the 180 kt peak value on the NOAA 
flight, up from 166 kt reported operationally.  SFMR winds of comparable values have only once 
been previously measured in a tropical cyclone (Supertyphoon Megi in 2010).  Patricia’s peak 
intensity is estimated to be slightly higher, at 185 kt, since the satellite signature of the storm 
continued to increase in organization (warmest eye and coldest surrounding cloud-top 
temperatures) between the two aircraft flights until around 1200 UTC.  The 185-kt analyzed peak 
intensity makes Patricia the strongest hurricane on record in the eastern North Pacific, surpassing 
Hurricane Linda in 1997 (Fig. 6).  Patricia is also the strongest hurricane on record in either the 
eastern North Pacific or North Atlantic basins.  It should be noted, however, that records for the 
most intense eastern North Pacific hurricanes are particularly uncertain prior to 1988; records for 
the most extreme North Atlantic hurricanes are considered reliable beginning in the early 1970s 
at the start of routine monitoring of the basin using satellite and aircraft data.  
Patricia’s explosive deepening from 22 October to 23 October was remarkable.   Over the 
24-h period ending at 0600 UTC 23 October, the pressure is estimated to have fallen 95 mb and 
 Hurricane Patricia     5 
 
the wind to have increased from 75 kt to 180 kt.  Over a 2-day period ending at the same time, 
the winds are estimated to have increased by nearly 150 kt.  The 1-day intensification of 105 kt 
exceeds a 95-kt increase for Hurricane Wilma in 2005 over the western Caribbean Sea.  This 
intensification occurred while Patricia was moving in a very light shear and moist environment 
while over an expansive region of anomalously warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of 30.5ºC 
to 31º C, which are the highest SSTs ever observed over this region to the south of Mexico in 
mid-October  (Fig. 7).    
A pressure of 885 mb was measured by dropsonde at 0646 UTC with splash winds of 57 
kt, supporting an estimated minimum pressure of 879 mb. The central pressure was still falling on 
the last pass through the eye at 0646 UTC (by 7 mb between the last two fixes that were 45 min 
apart), and it is possible in the hours that followed that Patricia’s pressure fell lower than the global 
record value of 870 mb observed in Supertyphoon Tip in 1979. The lowest central pressure 
measured by a dropsonde during Patricia was 883 mb at 1733 UTC 23 October.  Given surface 
winds from the dropsonde of 45 kt, Patricia’s minimum pressure at that time is also estimated to 
be 879 mb.  In between these two times, a minimum pressure of 872 mb has been assigned to 
1200 UTC 23 October, the time of the estimated peak winds.  The value of 872 mb was 
determined from the Knaff-Zehr-Courtney (KZC) pressure-wind relationship (Courtney and Knaff, 
2009), which very accurately reproduced the observed reconnaissance pressure-wind data near 
0600 and 1800 UTC that day (Fig. 3)3. The 872 mb value represents the lowest pressure on 
record in the western Hemisphere and the second lowest globally.  Also of note is the maximum 
700-mb temperature of 32.2º C measured by an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft at 1733 UTC, 
several hours after the time of estimated peak intensity; this is the warmest 700-mb eye 
temperature ever measured in a tropical cyclone.  A pressure gradient of up to 24 mb/n mi was 
computed from aircraft data on the 0600 UTC mission4; this is thought to be one of the steepest 
pressure gradients recorded in a tropical cyclone. 
The remarkably rapid intensification rate was followed by a period of weakening, at an 
even more rapid rate, beginning around 1800 UTC 23 October.  After a pressure of 879 mb was 
inferred from the dropsonde data at 1733 UTC, the plane made another pass through the center 
(after some technical difficulties) and launched a dropsonde at 2044 UTC that measured a 
pressure of 910 mb with 68 kt surface winds; these data support a minimum pressure of around 
903 mb at that time, corresponding to a filing rate of about 8 mb/h.   There was also a dramatic 
reduction in the winds measured by the reconnaissance aircraft in Patricia’s southeastern 
quadrant, following the 191-kt flight-level and 180-kt SFMR winds observed near 1733 UTC; the 
return trip to this quadrant at 2033 UTC found a peak flight-level wind of only 146 kt and a peak 
SFMR wind of 131 kt.   
Patricia made landfall around 2300 UTC along the coast of the Mexican state of Jalisco 
near Playa Cuixmala, about 45 n mi west-northwest of Manzanillo.  Operationally, Patricia was 
assessed to have been of category 5 intensity with a landfall pressure of 920 mb, but a post-
analysis of additional data obtained later suggests that the hurricane had weakened more rapidly 
                                               
 
3 The following inputs were used in the KCZ pressure-wind computation:  maximum sustained winds (185 
kt), latitude (17.3N), mean radius of tropical-storm-force winds averaged over the four quadrants of the 
cyclone (110 n mi), cyclone translation speed (8 kt), and the outermost closed isobar (1007 mb). 
4 The estimated pressure change over 1.39 n mi from reconnaissance data was 33.3 mb, or approximately 
24 mb per n mi.  
 Hurricane Patricia     6 
 
than estimated in real time.   A minimum pressure of 934.2 mb was observed around 2300 UTC 
by an automated weather station at Playa Cuixmala, located on the coast near Emiliano Zapata.  
Although the wind data from this site failed near landfall, a temperature spike to 28˚ C was 
recorded, suggesting that the eye passed close to this location.  A storm chaser in Emiliano 
Zapata, a couple of nautical miles inland from the landfall point, measured a minimum pressure 
of 937.8 mb on the eastern edge of the eye at 2313 UTC with simultaneous winds of near tropical 
storm force.  The automated weather station in Pista, located about a mile north-northeast of 
Playa Cuixmala, measured a station pressure of 939.4 mb at an elevation of 15 m, which converts 
to a sea level pressure of 941.0 mb. The wind data for this site indicate that the station never 
experienced a calm, and thus the winds at the time of the minimum pressure are unknown.  A plot 
of these pressures for comparison is given in Figure 8.   A minimum central pressure of 932 mb 
at landfall is inferred from these data, with the uncertainty of this value likely on the order of 2-3 
mb.  The 932 mb analyzed landfall pressure is the lowest central pressure for a landfalling Pacific 
hurricane in Mexico in the historical database.  
There were several reports of high winds near or within Patricia’s radius of maximum 
winds; two of these warrant additional discussion.  An automated weather station in Chamela, 
belonging to the Mexican Weather Service (SMN) but operated by the NOAA 
Hydrometeorological Automated Data Systems (HADS), was located about 10 n mi northwest of 
Patricia’s eye.  Although maximum sustained winds from this site were operationally reported to 
be as high as 161 kt, with a gust of 183 kt, a time series of the wind data from this site indicates 
higher and unrealistic values.  It is not known at what point the data become questionable, 
however.  The site is at an elevation of about 85 m and is surrounded by complex terrain, which 
could result in local accelerations not representative of the cyclone’s sustained wind.  In addition, 
the station was probably located beyond Patricia’s small radius of maximum winds, estimated at 
about 5 n mi from the last reconnaissance flight, on the west or weaker side of the tropical cyclone.  
Based on these factors, the wind data from Chamela are deemed unreliable for estimating the 
maximum wind speed.   The automated weather station in Pista, a little more than 1 n mi inland 
from the coast near the point of landfall, reported peak sustained winds of 85 kt between 2230 
and 2300 UTC before the anemometer failed.   
With no reliable wind measurements near where Patricia made landfall, determining the 
landfall intensity is challenging.  Since there is good confidence in the landfall pressure, however, 
it is possible to estimate the maximum sustained winds from the central pressure.   The KZC 
pressure-wind relationship, which as noted above captured very precisely the reconnaissance 
data just a few hours prior to landfall, gives a value of 131 kt for a central pressure of 932 mb.5  
In addition, the Dvorak wind equivalent for the 54-mb filling that occurred from 1800 UTC until 
landfall is ~50 kt, which implies a landfall intensity of 130 kt.  Finally, the modified cyclostrophic 
balance equation, using the methodology detailed in Willoughby (1993) produces a landfall 
intensity of 128 kt6.  Based on these data, the landfall intensity of Patricia is estimated to be 130 
kt; this makes Patricia a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, the 
                                               
 
5 The remaining inputs for the KZC computation were:  latitude (19.4N), radius of tropical-storm-force winds 
averaged over the four quadrants of the cyclone (110 n mi), cyclone translation speed (13 kt), and the 
outermost closed isobar (1007 mb). 
6 Input parameters for the modified cyclostrophic computation were central pressure (932 mb) and 
environmental pressure (1007 mb). 
 Hurricane Patricia     7 
 
first major hurricane landfall in mainland Mexico since Hurricane Lane in 2006.   It should be noted 
that this estimate of 130 kt is has much less certainty than the landfall pressure estimate.   
Patricia is the strongest hurricane on record to affect Mexico in the historical data base 
extending back to 1949, eclipsing the October 1959 Manzanillo hurricane (recently reassessed to 
have made landfall at an intensity of 120 kt - see recent discussion at http://hurricanes.gov) and 
Hurricane Madeline in 1976.  However, because of the sparse nature of station observations over 
Mexico, the reliable record for extreme landfalling Mexican hurricanes is also tied to the availability 
and interpretation of satellite imagery of these systems, and is thought to be reliable only back to 
1988.   
Patricia’s central pressure is estimated to have risen 54 mb in the 5 h prior to landfall. No 
other over-water filling rate this large appears in either the Atlantic or eastern North Pacific 
historical record.   
Patricia’s estimated intensity after landfall is based on output from the SHIPS Inland-
Decay model for higher terrain. 
Heavy rains occurred in association with Patricia, especially over or near elevated terrain 
(Table 2).  In general, two to five inches of rain occurred at sites at lower elevation, with amounts 
not overly heavy due to the storm’s acceleration.  However, rainfall accumulations of about 8 to 
13 inches occurred over mountainous terrain, with Nevado Colima in Jalisco reporting a storm 
total rainfall of 12.50 inches (318 mm). 
 
CASUALTY AND DAMAGE STATISTICS 
 
 
Press reports indicate that there were two direct deaths7 attributed to Patricia.  Two 
women, one from Argentina and the other from Coahuila, Mexico, were crushed when a tree fell 
on them at a campsite in the Tapalpa forest in Jalisco.   Apparently, the camping party of which 
they were a part was unaware of the hurricane.  There were four indirect deaths associated with 
the storm, when four passengers were killed in an automobile accident on the Colima-Guadalajara 
highway during heavy rains and strong winds associated with the storm. 
     
Patricia battered a sparsely populated and rural area of the southwestern coast of Mexico 
in Jalisco, nearly midway between Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta.  A joint survey conducted by 
CONAGUA and the United States National Weather Service after the storm indicated that Patricia 
produced a narrow swath of severe damage along and just inland from the coast near where the 
hurricane made landfall.  The villages of Emiliano Zapata and Chamela sustained the worst 
damage, according to press reports and eyewitness accounts. Strong winds tore roofs off of 
homes and businesses, uprooted, snapped and defoliated nearly all trees (Fig. 9), and left the 
                                               
 
7 Deaths occurring as a direct result of the forces of the tropical cyclone are referred to as “direct” deaths. 
These would include those persons who drowned in storm surge, rough seas, rip currents, and freshwater 
floods. Direct deaths also include casualties resulting from lightning and wind-related events (e.g., 
collapsing structures). Deaths occurring from such factors as heart attacks, house fires, electrocutions from 
downed power lines, vehicle accidents on wet roads, etc., are considered “indirect” deaths. 
 Hurricane Patricia     8 
 
hillsides stripped of vegetation.  Concrete power poles and transmission lines were also toppled, 
communication towers were crumpled, and most structures in these small towns were 
tremendously damaged or destroyed (Fig. 10). The small fishing villages of El Melaque, El 
Estrecho, and La Manzanilla to the southeast of the landfall location were also badly affected.  
Overall, more than 10,000 homes were damaged or destroyed by Patricia, with the majority of 
these in Jalisco. The damage to the agricultural sector was also considerable; about 100,000 
acres of farmland were severely affected, with the primary losses to the papaya, banana, and 
plantain crops. 
Heavy rains associated with Patricia caused severe flooding in some areas, especially 
near or over elevated terrain.  Some of the heavy rains extended well to the southeast of Patricia’s 
track in the Mexican state of Michoacán. The Marabasco River in this area overflowed its banks 
in El Rebalse, resulting in water that was reported to be chest high.  The high water made many 
roads impassable and isolated nearby communities. Flood waters damaged several hundred 
houses in Coahuayana, and Highway 200 was reported to be temporarily shut down.   
Large swells associated with Patricia caused significant coastal flooding for several days 
that resulted in beach erosion and damage to some structures in the Mexican states from Jalisco 
to Guerrero. 
According to media reports, the preliminary damage from Patricia is estimated to be 5.4 
billion Mexican pesos (~325 million USD).  
 
FORECAST AND WARNING CRITIQUE 
 
The genesis of Patricia was well forecast, especially in the extended-range portion of the 
Tropical Weather Outlook (TWO) (Table 3).  Patricia’s precursor disturbance was introduced in 
the 5-day portion of the TWO 150 h prior to genesis, and the genesis probabilities reached the 
medium (40 – 60%) and high (greater than 60%) categories 132 h and 96 h before tropical cyclone 
formation, respectively.  NHC’s genesis forecasts benefited from the strong signal in global 
models five or more days in advance that tropical cyclone formation would occur over the eastern 
portion of the eastern Pacific basin.  However, the GFS and ECMWF models generally forecast 
Patricia’s genesis too soon. Official genesis forecasts over the short-range (48-h period) were not 
as good since gauging the effects of a gap wind event on the potential for genesis in the short 
range was difficult. As a result, the precursor disturbance was not given a high chance of tropical 
cyclone formation until 12 h prior to genesis.  
A verification of NHC official track forecasts for Patricia is given in Table 4a.  Official 
forecast track errors were greater than the mean official errors for the previous 5-yr period at all 
times through 96 h, though the sample size after 72 h is very small.  Early track forecasts were 
considerably east of the best track, and the official forecast only converged to the actual track by 
0000 UTC 22 October.  A homogeneous comparison of the official track errors with selected 
guidance models is given in Table 4b.  The FSU Superensemble was the most accurate of all the 
track guidance, beating the official forecast at all times.  The variable multi-model and corrected 
consensus aids (TVCE and TCON) also outperformed the official forecast.  Several other models 
 Hurricane Patricia     9 
 
did well relative to the official forecast at various forecast lead times, with the GFS and GFDL 
models standing out from 36 to 72 h. 
A verification of NHC official intensity forecasts for Patricia is given in Table 5a.  Official 
forecast intensity errors were substantially greater than the mean official errors for the previous 
5-yr period at all forecast lead times. Several forecasts had intensity errors through 48 h that were 
the highest on record since the National Hurricane Center took over warning responsibility in the 
eastern North Pacific basin in 1988 (Fig. 13). The official intensity forecasts severely 
underestimated the rapid intensification that occurred and failed to explicitly show rapid 
intensification until it was actually occurring.  It should be noted, however, that the SHIPS Rapid 
Intensity (RI) guidance was temporarily unavailable before Patricia’s rapid intensification began 
due to missing satellite inputs.  Having these data in real time would likely have resulted in higher 
intensity forecasts than those that were made.  A homogeneous comparison of the official 
intensity errors with selected guidance models is given in Table 5b. The statistical guidance 
generally beat the official forecast while the dynamical guidance performed poorly in predicting 
Patricia’s intensity.  The FSU Superensemble also did well against the official intensity forecast 
through 36 h.  However, none of the guidance anticipated the degree to which Patricia would 
intensify, nor how quickly it would occur.  
 
Watches and warnings issued by the government of Mexico in association with Patricia 
are given in Table 6.

Figure 2. 
Selected wind observations and best track maximum sustained surface wind speed curve for Hurricane Patricia, 20-24 October 
2015.  Aircraft observations have been adjusted for elevation using 90%, 80%, and 80% adjustment factors for observations 
from 700 mb, 850 mb, and 1500 ft, respectively.  Dropwindsonde observations include actual 10 m winds (sfc), as well as 
surface estimates derived from the mean wind over the lowest 150 m of the wind sounding (LLM).  Advanced Dvorak Technique 
estimates represent the Current Intensity at the nominal observation time. There is a slight lag in the peak ADT intensity and 
the estimated peak best track intensity due to rules basic to the ADT algorithm.  AMSU intensity estimates are from the 
Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies technique.  Dashed vertical lines correspond to 0000 UTC, and the 
solid vertical line corresponds to the time of landfall.
