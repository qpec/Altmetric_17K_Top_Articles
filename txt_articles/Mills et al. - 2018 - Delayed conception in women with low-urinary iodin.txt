STUDY QUESTION: Is iodine deficiency associated with decreased fecundability?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Moderate to severe iodine deficiency is associated with a 46% decrease in fecundability.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Iodine deficiency is common in women of childbearing age but its effect on fecundability has not been
investigated.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The LIFE Study, a population-based prospective cohort study, enrolled 501 women who had dis-
continued contraception within 2 months to become pregnant between 2005 and 2009.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women reported on risk factors for infertility by interview then kept daily
journals of relevant information. Women used fertility monitors to time intercourse relative to ovulation then used home digital pregnancy
tests to identify pregnancies on the day of expected menstruation. Urine samples for iodine analysis were collected on enrollment.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Samples were in the deficiency range in 44.3% of participants. The group whose iod-
ine–creatinine ratios were below 50 μg/g (moderate to severe deficiency) had a 46% reduction in fecundity (P = 0.028) compared with the
group whose iodine–creatinine ratios were in the adequate range: adjusted fecundability odds ratio of becoming pregnant per cycle, 0.54
(95% confidence interval 0.31–0.94).
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Iodine concentrations vary within individuals over time, so the data must be interpreted by
group as we have done; residual confounding is possible.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Significant delays in becoming pregnant occur at iodine concentrations that are common
in women in the USA and parts of Europe. Replicating these findings will be important to determine whether improving iodine status could be
beneficial in improving fecundability.

 Introduction
Despite the fact that iodine deficiency is a global problem, the effect of
mild to moderate iodine deficiency on a woman’s ability to become
pregnant has received virtually no attention (Hetzel and Dunn, 1989;
Zimmermann et al., 2008; Zimmermann, 2011). One-third of
European
school-aged
children
have
insufficient
iodine
intakes
(Zimmermann et al., 2015). In the USA, iodine deficiency has become
a concern for both pregnant women and women of childbearing age
(Caldwell et al., 2013). The percentage of women of childbearing age
with urinary iodine sample concentrations below 50 μg/l (deficient)
increased 3.8 times between 1971–1974 and 1988–1994 (Hollowell
et al., 1998, Pan et al., 2013). More than 30% of urinary iodine concen-
trations in non-pregnant women of childbearing age are below the tar-
get of 100 μg/l (Pan et al., 2013, Stagnaro-Green et al., 2015). To our
knowledge, however, no studies have examined the effects of iodine
deficiency on fecundity. This investigation was conducted to determine
whether urinary iodine status in women attempting to become preg-
nant was associated with time required to become pregnant.
Materials and Methods
Ethical approval
Full human subjects’ approval was obtained from all participating institu-
tions and all couples gave informed consent before any data collection.
Study cohort and design
The LIFE Study was a prospective cohort study that enrolled 501 couples
who were discontinuing contraception to become pregnant or were within
2 months of having done so. The study methods have been reported in
detail previously (Buck Louis et al., 2011). In brief, couples were recruited
from a defined area of 16 counties in Michigan and Texas. Couples plan-
ning a pregnancy were initially contacted by letter, then by a telephone
screening interview. After obtaining full and informed consent, couples
who wished to participate were seen at their homes for in depth inter-
views and training. Blood and urine samples were obtained.
The protocol called for keeping daily journals of lifestyle, sexual inter-
course, menstruation and pregnancy test results. Women used Clearblue
Easy™ Fertility Monitor (SPD Development Company Ltd., formerly
Unipath, UK) to help time intercourse to ovulation. A menstrual cycle was
determined using fertility monitor data and daily journal information.
Pregnancies were identified promptly by the Clearblue Easy™ digital home
pregnancy test (Behre et al., 2000). Pregnancy was defined as a positive
hCG test on the day of expected menstruation.
Spot urine samples used for iodine and creatinine determinations were
collected at the time of enrollment. Factors potentially affecting fecundity
were documented by trained interviewers. Height and weight were mea-
sured by research assistants using a standard protocol to calculate body
mass index. Based on the interview data, measurements and the literature,
covariates identified as risk factors and adjusted for in the analysis were:
female age (years), body mass index (normal—less than 25, overweight—25–29.9
or obese—30 or greater), preconception serum cotinine concentration cate-
gorized as non-smokers (<3 ng/ml), passive (3 to <10 ng/ml), and active
smokers (at least 10 ng/ml), (Wall et al., 1988) study site, difference in age
between male and female partners, frequency of sexual intercourse during
the fertile period (5 days prior to ovulation to 1 day after) and history of thy-
roid disease.
Eligibility criteria
Women were eligible if they were planning a pregnancy; were married or
in a committed relationship; were between 18 and 40 years of age; had
self-reported menstrual cycles ranging from 21 to 42 days; had not used
injectable hormonal contraception in the past 12 months; were not off
contraception for more than 2 months; were able to communicate in
English or Spanish; and had a partner aged 18 or older.
Statistical analyses
Iodine status was characterized using World Health Organization (WHO)
(WHO, 2007) cut-offs: normal (100 or greater μg/l), mild deficiency
(50–99 μg/l), moderate deficiency (20–49 μg/l) and severe deficiency
(<20 μg/l). The moderate and severe deficiency groups were combined
due to the limited number of samples in the severe group. The analysis
was performed using iodine to creatinine concentration ratios (below 50,
50 to 99 and 100 μg/g and above). Thyroid disease (yes/no) was first ana-
lyzed as a covariate in all participants because hypothyroidism may be due
to severe iodine deficiency. Then thyroid disease was treated as an exclu-
sion because hypothyroidism treatment might affect iodine measures.
Descriptive characteristics were compared using Student’s t-test or
Wilcoxon nonparametric test for continuous data and chi-squared test or
Fisher’s exact test for categorical data. Iodine concentrations were com-
pared by pregnancy status (pregnant, not pregnant or withdrew) using the
Kruskal–Wallis test. Cox models for discrete survival time were used to
estimate the 95% confidence Interval (CI) and fecundability odds ratio
(FOR) which estimates the adjusted odds of becoming pregnant in each
cycle conditional on not achieving pregnancy in the previous cycle. FORs
<1 indicate a lower probability of becoming pregnant, a reduction in
fecundity or a longer time to pregnancy compared with the reference
group in that cycle (Rothman et al., 2008).
Couples who withdrew before pregnancy, or who were not pregnant
after 12 months of follow-up, were censored at the last observed cycle.
Additional analyses were conducted to assess the association between
fecundability and iodine–creatinine concentrations using splines, as well as
examining the effect of body mass index and cotinine using splines to mod-
el nonlinear effects. We also conducted analyses using the iodine concen-
tration while adjusting for creatinine concentration as a covariate.
Laboratory methods
Each urine sample (100 μl) was mixed with 1μl of acetic acid and 1μl of
ascorbic acid (Mishra et al., 2000, Minakata et al., 2010) and incubated at
room temperature for 10 min. After tetramethylammonium hydroxide
digestion was performed at 90°C (Blazewicz et al., 2014, Huynh et al.,
2015), 1.87 ml of water and 1.5μl of acetic acid were added and centri-
fuged for 15 min at 4000 × g. The supernatant was injected into high-
performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (Quattro
LC, Micromass, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) with a 250 mm ×
2 mm IonPac AS-21 anion exchange column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA). An isocratic mobile phase of 20 mM aqueous methylamine was
used at a flow rate of 300 μl/min. Iodide was monitored by the mass trans-
ition of m/z 127→m/z 127 for I−. The cone voltage and the collision
energy were 40 and 22 V, respectively. The limit of quantitation for urinary
iodide was 5 ng/ml. Procedural blank, duplicate and matrix spike samples
were included in each batch of 50–75 samples analyzed. Iodide was not
detected in procedural blanks. Reference urine samples from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of known iodide concentration
(from EQUIP, Ensuring the Quality of Iodine Procedures) were also ana-
lyzed with each batch of samples. Laboratory personnel were masked to
all other study data.

 Results
There were 501 women initially enrolled. 348 (69.5%) entered the
study in the woman’s first cycle after beginning unprotected inter-
course; 61 (12.2%) entered in the second cycle and 92 (18.4%)
entered in their third menstrual cycle. Of the 501 women enrolled,
467 (93%) had sufficient urine available for iodine analysis. Over
the 12-month study period, 332 (71%) became pregnant; 47 (10%)
did not become pregnant and 88 (19%) withdrew or were lost to
follow-up.
Women ranged in age from 18 to 40 years (Table I). Women who
completed the study differed significantly from those who withdrew
on body mass index (BMI), education, race/ethnicity and income.
Women who became pregnant were younger, more likely to have at
least a college education, and had a higher income than women who
did not become pregnant. Ninety percent of the women in the LIFE
cohort took vitamins during the study. The percentage of women who
had a history of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism did not differ sig-
nificantly by group. Caffeine and alcohol use were not significantly dif-
ferent across groups.
Urinary iodine concentrations were sufficient (100 or greater μg/l) in
260 (55.7%), mildly deficient (50–99 μg/l) in 102 (21.8%), moderately
deficient (20–49 μg/l) in 97 (20.8%) and severely deficient (<20 μg/l)
in 8 (1.7%) samples. Iodine excretion category was not significantly
related to age, education, income, race/ethnicity, BMI or history of
hypo- or hyperthyroidism (Table II). Any history of hypothyroidism
was reported by 36 women (7.7%), of whom 30 (6.4%) were being
treated during the study. Any history of hyperthyroidism was
reported by 5 women (1.1%), of whom 3 (0.6%) were being treated
during the study. There was no significant difference in the probability
of becoming pregnant in women who had thyroid disease compared
with women who did not.
The median iodine concentrations and interquartile ranges (IQR)
were 112.8 μg/l (53.6 to 216.9) in the entire population, 114.1 μg/l
(103.1 to 126.3) in those who became pregnant, 97.2 μg/l (73.5 to
128.5) in those who did not become pregnant, and 113.6 μg/l (92.9 to
138.9) in those who withdrew. Median iodine concentrations were
lower in the group that did not become pregnant versus the group
that did, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P =
0.27). Iodine concentrations in the moderate or severely deficient
range were more common in the women who did not become preg-
nant (29.8%) compared with the women who did become pregnant
(21.4%) (P = 0.23). Iodine concentrations in the mild deficiency range
were present in approximately equal percentages of women who did
(22.3%) and did not (21.3%) become pregnant (P = 0.88).
Time to pregnancy provided a powerful tool for examining iodine
effects because the time under observation in those who left the study
could be included in the analysis. For example, if a woman participated
for several months without becoming pregnant, we were able to
include that information in the analysis. Using iodine–creatinine ratio
adjusting for thyroid disease, we found that the group with iodine–
creatinine ratios <50 μg/g took significantly longer to get pregnant
(Fig. 1) than those with iodine–creatinine ratios ≥100 μg/g (P =
0.028). In fact, the FOR was reduced by 46% (FOR 0.54, 95% CI
0.31–0.94) over each cycle (Table III). Excluding all women with any
past or current thyroid disease, the FOR was 0.56 (0.32, 0.98) P =
0.041. Alternatively, using WHO criteria, adjusting for urine volume by
a creatinine term in the regression analysis, the group of women within
the moderately or severely iodine-deficient range took significantly
longer (P = 0.021) to become pregnant than those whose samples
were in the iodine sufficient range, FOR 0.63 (0.43, 0.93). Thus, mod-
erate to severe deficiency was associated with an important increase
in time to pregnancy reflecting decreased fecundity after accounting
for thyroid disease, censoring and other risk factors by both iodine–
creatinine ratio and WHO criteria.
Additional sensitivity analyses dropping women who were being
treated for hypo/hyperthyroidism (P = 0.046), dropping all women
who ever had hypothyroidism (P = 0.046), and adjusting for BMI and
cotinine using splines (P = 0.023) (data not shown) all confirmed that
iodine concentrations in the moderate to severe deficiency range
were associated with significant delay in becoming pregnant. In con-
trast, the group whose iodine–creatinine ratios were 50 to 99 μg/g did
not have a significantly longer time to pregnancy than women whose
ratios were above 100 μg/g (in the sufficient range) after adjustment
(FOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58–1.12) (Table III). Using splines to examine the
relationship between iodine and fecundability (Fig. 2) showed that
fecundity was decreased when iodine–creatinine ratio was in the defi-
cient range.
Discussion
Women who had iodine samples in the moderate to severe deficiency
range took significantly longer to become pregnant, experiencing a
46% decrease in probability of becoming pregnant over each cycle
compared to the iodine sufficient group. The mildly deficient range
group had a smaller, non-significant increase in time to conception sug-
gesting that the risk, if any, is modest in this group. In our study, 44.3%
of the participants had sample concentrations below the sufficiency
concentration, 22.5% in the moderate to severe deficiency range. The
significant delay in time to pregnancy in that group raises serious con-
cerns given the high prevalence of iodine deficiency in women of child-
bearing age.
There is good biological support for our findings. Mild to moderate
iodine deficiency during pregnancy has demonstrable effects on thyroid
function (Glinoer, 2001). Thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations
rise; thyroglobulin concentrations are above the normal range in two-
thirds of women; and goiter is more common. Treating iodine-
deficient sheep increased pregnancy rates from 37 to 100% (Ferri
et al., 2003). Despite the lack of studies of iodine deficiency and
fecundity in humans, it is well known that insufficient iodine causes
hypothyroidism, and there is evidence for a number of mechanisms by
which hypothyroidism could cause infertility. Low thyroid hormone
concentrations are associated with thyrotropin-releasing hormone ele-
vations that stimulate prolactin, which in turn interferes with GnRH
pulsatility (Poppe et al., 2007, Chang and Auchus, 2014). They also
cause decreased granulosa cell steroid production (Trokoudes et al.,
2006, Chang and Auchus, 2014) and alterations in androgen and estro-
gen concentrations (Trokoudes et al., 2006, Chang and Auchus,
2014). In addition, thyroid hormone receptors are expressed in
oocytes, granulosa cells and cumulus cells (Zhang et al., 1997) and thy-
roid hormone in conjunction with follicle stimulating hormone regu-
lates ovarian follicle development in rats (Kobayashi et al., 2009).
Thus, there are a number of biological mechanisms by which iodine
deficiency can interfere with fertility.

Figure 1 Percentage of women not achieving pregnancy by number of observed menstrual cycles. Group iodine excretion is reported as iodine–cre-
atinine ratio. Women with any history of thyroid disease are excluded. Data are adjusted for time-off birth control, female age (in years), BMI (categor-
ized as normal, overweight or obese), preconception cotinine concentration categorized as non-smokers (<3 ng/ml), passive (3 ng/ml to <10 ng/ml)
and active (at least 10 ng/ml) and study site. ‘Observed events’ is defined as the number of pregnancies occurring in the interval.

 This study has numerous strengths. A large number of women were
identified shortly after they discontinued using contraception (avoiding
the problem that clinically ascertained populations who volunteer for
these studies may have chronic infertility). The use of sensitive hCG
pregnancy tests ensured accurate diagnosis of pregnancies. Daily jour-
nals allowed time to pregnancy to be calculated accurately. Actual
urine iodine measures were available at entry, avoiding the problem
that dietary reports of iodine intake are inaccurate (Gahche et al.,
2013).
Some limitations should be noted. Iodine concentrations may vary
considerably within individuals over time (Rasmussen et al., 1999) so
data must be interpreted by group as we have done, not by individual.
The study population was largely white, so the findings may not be
generalizable to other racial/ethnic groups. Iodine was measured
when women enrolled. Iodine excretion might have changed over the
study period. We were unable to measure thyroid hormones. Some
women withdrew during the study; however, we were able to show
that their iodine concentrations did not differ significantly from those
who completed the study and they did not differ from those who
remained on risk factors for delayed conception. Furthermore, many
women contributed to the time to pregnancy analysis until they with-
drew. Although women who did not become pregnant were much
more likely to have samples in the moderate to severe iodine defi-
ciency range than women who became pregnant (30 vs 21%) this dif-
ference did not reach statistical significance. We were, however, able
to confirm the finding that moderate to severe deficiency decreases
fecundity in multiple analyses taking into account urine concentration,
treated and untreated thyroid disease and other potential confounding
factors and it remained statistically significant in all these analyses.
Iodine deficiency is not rare, occurring in over two-thirds of British
school girls. (Vanderpump et al., 2011) Approximately one-third of
American women of childbearing age have urinary iodine concentra-
tions below 100 μg/l (Stagnaro-Green et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2013).
Although it seems incongruous that deficiency would be common in a
population with high sodium intake, the likely explanation is that most
sodium in the diet comes from processed food, and it appears that
most salt in processed food is not iodized. Almost half the women in
our study had iodine samples in the deficient range suggesting that
many women trying to become pregnant could be at risk for fecundity
problems.
Little information has been available on the impact of mild or mod-
erate iodine deficiency, despite its frequency (Zimmermann et al.,
2008, Bath et al., 2013, Rayman and Bath, 2015). Fecundity has not, to
our knowledge, been investigated. Therefore, our data provide
important guidance for establishing target iodine concentrations in
women of childbearing age. The population of women who have low-
urinary iodine status (<50 μg/g or 50 μg/l) are clearly at risk for pro-
blems should they attempt to become pregnant. The group between
50 and 100 μg/g or μg/l may be at risk, but if they are, the risk is much
smaller. The demand for iodine increases substantially during preg-
nancy, which is why the lower limit of normal is increased to 150 μg/l
(WHO, 2007). Therefore, it is reasonable to recommend that concen-
trations of at least 100 μg/l are desirable in populations of women of
childbearing age if they may become pregnant.
In summary, our data show that groups of women with iodine con-
centrations in the moderate to severely deficient range experience a
significantly longer time to pregnancy and diminished fecundity. These

 findings should be replicated to determine whether iodine deficiency
might be added to the list of considerations when evaluating women
with fecundity problems. The US and European countries where iod-
ine deficiency is common should evaluate the need for programs to
increase iodine intake for women of childbearing age, particularly
those trying to become pregnant.
