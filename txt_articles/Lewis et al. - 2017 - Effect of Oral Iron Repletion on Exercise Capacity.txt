Abstract
Importance—Iron deficiency is present in approximately 50% of patients with heart failure with 
reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and is an independent predictor of reduced 
functional capacity and mortality. However, the efficacy of inexpensive, readily available oral iron 
supplementation in heart failure is unknown.
Objective—To test whether therapy with oral iron improves peak exercise capacity in patients 
with HFrEF and iron deficiency.

 Design, Setting, and Participants—Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized 
clinical trial of patients with HFrEF (<40%) and iron deficiency, defined as serum ferritin level 
between 15–100 ng/ml or serum ferritin 101-299 ng/ml with transferrin saturation (Tsat) <20%. 
Patients were enrolled between September 2014 and November 2015 at 23 US sites.
Interventions—Oral iron polysaccharide (n = 111) or placebo (n = 114), 150 mg twice daily for 
16 weeks.
Main Outcomes and Measures—The primary endpoint was a change in peak oxygen uptake 
(VO2), from baseline to 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints included changes in six minute walk 
distance; plasma NT-pro BNP levels; and health status as assessed by Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ, range 0-100, higher scores reflect better quality of life).
Results—Among 225 randomized patients (median age 63 years, 36% women) 203 completed 
the study. The median baseline peak VO2 was 1196 ml/min (887, 1448 ml/min) in the oral iron 
group and 1167 ml/min (887, 1449 ml/min) in the placebo group. The primary endpoint, change in 
peak VO2, did not significantly differ between the oral iron and placebo groups (+23 ml/min vs −2 
ml/min; difference, 21 ml/min [95% CI, −34 to +76]; P=.46). Similarly, at 16 weeks there were no 
significant differences between treatment groups in changes in 6-minute walk distance (−13, −32 
to 6m), NT-pro BNP levels (159, −280 to 599 pg/ml), KCCQ Score (1, −2.4 to 4.4) or time to first 
adverse event (hazard ratio 0.85, 0.56 to 1.31), all p>0.05.
Conclusion—Among patients with HFrEF with iron deficiency, high-dose oral iron did not 
improve exercise capacity over 16 weeks. These results do not support use of oral iron 
supplementation in patients with HFrEF.

Clinical Studies
Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, affecting more than 
15% of the global population as of 20101, and approximately one half of patients with 
symptomatic heart failure.2 The presence of iron deficiency in patients with heart failure, 
regardless of hemoglobin status, is associated with reduced functional capacity, poorer 
quality of life, and increased mortality.2,3
Iron plays a critical role in systemic oxygen (O2) delivery and utilization.3–6 Iron contributes 
to erythropoiesis and therefore iron deficiency decreases O2-carrying capacity of the blood 
through reduced hemoglobin levels. Iron is also an obligate component of enzymes involved 
in cellular respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, vascular homeostasis, nitric oxide 
generation, and the citric acid cycle.7,8 Hence, cells with high energy demands, including 
skeletal and cardiac myocytes, are particularly sensitive to depleted iron stores.9 Cardiac 
iron deficiency is present in patients with heart failure and associated with impaired 
mitochondrial function,10 abnormal sarcomere structure,5 and LV systolic dysfunction.11,12

 Despite growing recognition of the functional and prognostic significance of iron deficiency, 
randomized multicenter trials exploring the utility of oral iron supplementation, a therapy 
that is inexpensive, readily available, and safe, have not been performed in patients with 
heart failure. Moreover, patient characteristics and biochemical profiles that may influence 
responsiveness to oral iron in patients with heart failure have not been defined. Although 
results of intravenous iron repletion trials have been favorable,13,14 regularly treating 
patients with intravenous iron products is expensive and poses logistical challenges for 
outpatients. The Iron Repletion effects ON Oxygen UpTake in Heart Failure (IRONOUT 
HF) trial was designed to test the hypothesis that, compared to placebo, oral iron repletion in 
heart failure patients with iron deficiency improves exercise capacity after 16 weeks of 
therapy.
METHODS
Study Oversight
All study participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. The National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–sponsored Heart Failure Clinical Research Network 
investigators conceived, designed, and conducted this study. The trial protocol was approved 
by a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–appointed protocol review committee and 
data and safety monitoring board, and by the institutional review board at each participating 
site. The Duke Clinical Research Institute served as the coordinating center.
Study Design
The rationale for, and design of this study have been previously described,15 and the full 
protocol appears in Supplement 1. Patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction 
(≤40%) and heart failure with New York Heart Association functional class II through IV 
symptoms who were stable while receiving medical therapy were eligible to participate if 
they had objective evidence of iron deficiency (ferritin 15-100 ng/ml or between 100-299 
ng/ml with a transferrin saturation [Tsat] below 20%) and hemoglobin levels between 9-15 
g/dl (males) or 9-13.5 g/dl (females).15 Individuals were excluded if a neuromuscular, 
orthopedic or other non-cardiac condition prevented cardiopulmonary exercise testing 
(CPET). Inability to achieve a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) ≥ 1.0 on screening/baseline 
CPET was also an exclusion criterion. A complete list of the trial inclusion and exclusion 
criteria is provided in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.
Race, ethnicity and gender were included as data elements to satisfy the NHLBI Policy for 
Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Clinical Research. Race, Ethnicity and gender 
determinations were made by the participants and collected as fixed categories. 
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed by CPET Core Lab certified sites using 
equipment and calibration approaches that met American Thoracic Society standards. 
CPETs were performed using a 10 Watt/minute incremental ramp protocol and breath-by-
breath measures of oxygen uptake were uniformly analyzed by the CPET Core Lab. Quality 
control measures included repeated physiologic calibration testing with a normal individual 
to ensure proper equipment calibration and performance. Participants who met screening 
criteria underwent baseline studies, including history and physical examination, CPET,

 Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)16, 6-minute walk test, and phlebotomy 
for biomarkers, and were then randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either oral iron 
polysaccharide or placebo with the use of an automated web-based system. A permuted 
block randomization method (with 4 participants per block) was stratified by enrolling site 
and anemia status (defined as hemoglobin < 12 g/dL).
Study drug was administered orally at 150 mg, twice daily for 16 weeks. At the end of 8 
weeks participants underwent a history and physical examination and a 6-minute walk test in 
addition to completing a KCCQ quality of life questionnaire. At the end of 16 weeks, each 
subject’s history and physical examination, KCCQ, CPET and 6-minute walk test were 
repeated in the same order. If adverse effects developed, study staff could recommend 
discontinuation of study drug or dose frequency reduction to once daily. Blinded central core 
laboratories assessed biomarkers (University of Vermont) and CPET endpoints 
(Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University).
Study End Points
The primary end point was the change in peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) after 16 weeks of 
therapy. Change in peak VO2 reflects the multiple mechanisms by which iron repletion is 
expected to improve systemic oxygen delivery and utilization, as previously described in the 
methods manuscript for this study.15 There is also significant intrinsic value to patients in 
improving impaired exercise capacity, a cardinal manifestation of HF. Secondary endpoints 
included assessments of: (1) submaximal exercise capacity, as measured by O2 uptake 
kinetics upon initiation of exercise;17 (2) ventilatory efficiency, as measured by minute 
ventilation relative to CO2 production throughout exercise; (3) 6 minute walk distance; (4) 
plasma NT-pro BNP levels; and (5) KCCQ. Exploratory objectives sought to determine if 
pre-specified subgroups of patients derive differential benefit from oral iron: (1) patients 
with or without anemia; (2) patients with or without venous congestion, based on jugular 
venous pressure (JVP) > 10 cm or lower extremity edema; and (3) patients with and without 
a respiratory exchange ratios (RER) greater than 1.1 during both maximum incremental 
exercise tests. Other exploratory objectives included whether oral iron repletion influenced 
clinical outcomes: time to death and heart failure hospitalization, O2 uptake at the 
ventilatory threshold, or renal function (creatinine, cystatin C). Iron studies (iron, total iron 
binding capacity, and ferritin) were measured at baseline and after 16 weeks of study 
medication to determine the extent to which oral iron led to iron repletion in HFrEF patients.
Hepcidin is a hepatically-derived peptide that inhibits intestinal iron absorption by 
interacting with its specific transmembrane receptor (ferroportin) on target cells. Hepcidin 
causes reduced expression of ferroportin, which is responsible for importing systemic iron 
from enterocytes and also iron release from the reticuloendothelial system.18–21 An iron-
replete state stimulates hepcidin expression and reduces iron absorption. Iron depletion 
suppresses hepcidin levels and enhances iron absorption. Inflammation can also induce 
hepcidin expression independent of iron stores and thus, inappropriately limit iron 
absorption.22 Because heart failure is associated with increased inflammation, predisposing 
to hepcidin dysregulation, this study sought to determine if baseline hepcidin levels 
predicted oral iron responsiveness. In addition, we measured soluble transferrin receptor

 (sTr) levels because elevated levels are observed in states of high cellular avidity for iron but 
whether levels normalize with oral iron repletion is unknown.18 Therefore plasma hepcidin 
levels and soluble transferrin receptor levels were measured at baseline and after 16 weeks to 
gain mechanistic insight into oral iron responsiveness in heart failure.
Statistical Analysis
The full statistical analysis plan appears in Supplement 3. All primary analyses were based 
on the intention-to-treat principle meaning that study participants were analyzed as members 
of the treatment group to which they were randomized regardless of their adherence to, or 
whether they received, the intended treatment. A minimally important difference for peak 
VO2 of 1.0 ml/kg/min was used based on a previously determined significant relationship 
between that change in peak VO2 and heart failure outcomes.23 Using an estimate of 2.0 
ml/kg/min for the standard deviation for peak VO2, a sample size of 172 participants (86 per 
group) provided 90% power to detect the minimally important difference with a two-sided 
type I error of 0.05. Allowing for 20% missing data (to account for death, study withdrawal, 
or missing data) resulted in a sample size of at least 108 per group.
Baseline data are presented as medians (25th, 75th percentiles). A general linear model with 
the change in peak VO2 measured at 16 weeks as the response variable and predictor 
variables including a treatment indicator and the baseline measure of peak VO2 was used in 
the primary analysis. The primary analysis for peak VO2 used multiple imputation 
techniques to address incomplete data (shown in the Statistical Analysis Plan). A sensitivity 
analysis of the peak VO2 outcome used the patients with complete data at baseline and 16 
weeks. A mixed effects model was used to analyze site effects for the primary endpoint. For 
primary and secondary end points, p-values less than.05 were considered statistically 
significant with two-sided significance testing. All analyses were conducted with the use of 
SAS statistical software, version 9.4.
RESULTS
A total of 225 patients were enrolled in the trial from September 3, 2014, through November 
18, 2015, at 23 sites in the United States. Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. 
The median age was 63 years and 36% of the participants were female. Median duration of 
heart failure was 5.7 years. Ischemic heart disease was the primary etiology of HFrEF in 
78% of participants. Despite high rates of guideline directed medical therapies for HFrEF, 
the median NT-proBNP level at the time of enrollment was 1111 (453, 2412) pg/mL and the 
median left ventricular ejection fraction was 25% (20, 34%). Exercise capacity was reduced 
as evidenced by median peak VO2 of 13.2 (11.1, 15.7) ml/kg/min. Venous congestion was 
uncommon as only 12% of participants had jugular venous pressure elevation on 
examination and 10% of participants had at least mild peripheral edema. In the setting of 
low ferritin levels (median 69 ng/ml, IQR 40-98) and low Tsat levels (median 18%, IQR 
15-22%), median hemoglobin levels were reduced at 12.6 g/dL. Levels of soluble transferrin 
receptors, which increase during states of iron deficiency and high cellular avidity for iron, 
were elevated with a median value of 3.8 (3.1, 4.8) mg/L. Plasma levels of the iron 
regulatory peptide hepcidin were also elevated with a median value of 7.0 (3.5, 11.4) ng/ml.

 Use of anti-platelet drugs (68%) and anticoagulants (46%) was common. There was no 
important differences in any of the baseline clinical, laboratory, or CPET characteristics 
between patients in the two treatment arms.
At least one dose of study medication was received by all patients randomized to receive 
oral iron and 113 of the 114 patients randomized to receive placebo (Figure 1). Frequency of 
permanent study drug discontinuation prior to study termination were similar in the oral iron 
and placebo groups (14% and 15%, respectively, Figure 1) and the hazard ratio for time to 
permanent study drug discontinuation (0.90 favoring oral iron, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.79, p=0.76) 
did not significantly differ between groups.
Primary Endpoint
The median baseline peak VO2 was 1196 ml/min (887, 1448 ml/min) in the oral iron group 
and 1167 ml/min (887, 1449 ml/min) in the placebo group. The primary endpoint, change in 
peak VO2, did not differ between groups (oral iron +23 ml/min (95% CI, −84 to 142 ml/min) 
vs. placebo −2 ml/min (−110 to 104 ml/min), with a between group difference of 21 ml/min 
(−34, 76 ml/min, p=0.46, Table 2). The mean treatment difference in peak VO2 between oral 
iron and placebo was 0.3 ml/kg/min [−0.3, 0.9] ml/kg/min, p=0.30) when peak VO2 was 
normalized to body weight. Between-group differences in peak VO2 remained non-
significant after adjustment for site effects using mixed effects modeling (oral iron +23 ml/
min, [−28, 75], p = 0.37) and with sensitivity analyses using complete cases (oral iron + 23 
ml/min, [−33, 80], p=0.42) and worst rank analyses (oral iron 108 and placebo 95 with 
higher values indicating greater positive change in peak VO2, p=0.46). In pre-specified 
subgroup analyses, the change in peak VO2 was not significantly different between 
treatment groups in males vs. females, patients with or without hemoglobin level <12g/dl in 
females and <13.5g/dl in males, patients with or without baseline venous congestion, or 
patients with and without peak respiratory exchange ratios above 1.1 (a threshold indicative 
of maximum volitional effort)24 on baseline and 16-week CPETs (Supplement 2).
Secondary End Points and Safety
At 16 weeks there were no significant differences between treatment groups in change in 6-
minute walk distance (−13 [−32 to 6] m, p=0.19), NT-pro BNP levels (159 [−280 to 599] 
pg/ml, p=0.48), KCCQ Score (1 [−2.4 to 4.4], p=0.57), O2 uptake kinetics (3 [−2 to 8] s, 
p=0.19), or ventilatory efficiency, as indicated by the slope of minute ventilation relative to 
carbon dioxide elimination (VE/VCO2 slope, 0.8 [−0.3 to 2.6], p=0.35). The rates of serious 
adverse events observed with oral iron and placebo were similar, as reported in Table 2, 
eFigure 2 and eTable 2.
Exploratory Endpoints
At 16 weeks, when compared to placebo, oral iron was associated with an increment in VO2 
at the ventilatory threshold that was not statistically significant (+36.4 ml/min [−3.4 to 76.2 
ml/min], p=0.07). There were no differences in change in renal function between groups: 
creatinine (−0.02 [0.09 to 0.05] mg/dl, p=0.65) and Cystatin C (0.03 [−0.01 to 0.08] mg/L, 
p=0.12).

 Iron bioavailability—Measures of exercise capacity (peak VO2: r = 0.17, p=0.01; 6-min 
walk distance: r = 0.28, p<0.001), as well as NT-pro BNP (r = −0.16, p=0.02) and KCCQ 
Clinical Summary Score (r = 0.28, p<0.001) were all positively correlated with baseline Tsat 
levels (18% [15 to 22%]).
Compared to placebo, oral iron increased Tsat levels (+3% [1-5%]; p=0.003) and ferritin 
levels (+11 ng/ml [0-23 ng/ml] p=0.06) (Table 3 and eTable 2). Levels of soluble transferrin 
receptors decreased in patients treated with oral iron compared to placebo (−0.3 [−0.6 to 
−0.1]; p=0.01, Table 3). Patients in the highest quartile of response in Tsat in response to 
oral iron demonstrated improvement in KCCQ clinical summary scores (5.2 [0.1 to 10.4], 
p=0.047), and an increase in VO2 at the ventilatory threshold (58 ml/min [−7 to 123 ml/
min], p=0.08)that was not statistically significant. Changes in peak VO2 (r = 0.16, p=0.03) 
and in NT-Pro BNP (r = −0.18, p=0.02) correlated directly with change in Tsat.
Responders to Oral Iron Therapy—Median hepcidin levels increased from 6.7 to 8.9 
ng/ml (+1.7, −1.0 to 5.6ng/ml, p=0.007) in the oral iron group, consistent with the 
anticipated response to increased iron exposure, and remained unchanged in the placebo 
group (7.4 to 7.8 ng/ml; −0.3, −3.2 to 3.1ng/ml, p=0.91). The between group comparison of 
change in hepcidin levels was not statistically significant (+1.5, −0.6 to 3.7ng/ml, p=0.17, 
Table 3).
In response to 16 weeks of oral iron across quartiles of increasing baseline hepcidin levels, 
there were reduced increments in Tsat and ferritin and a blunted fall in soluble transferrin 
receptor levels (Figure 2). Changes in Tsat (r = −0.29, p=0.004), ferritin (r = −0.30, p=0.004) 
and soluble transferrin receptor levels (r = 0.48, p<0.001) at 16 weeks were correlated with 
baseline hepcidin levels.
DISCUSSION
High dose oral iron did not improve exercise capacity in patients with iron deficiency and 
HFrEF. The lack of effect of oral iron on exercise capacity, including peak VO2 and 6-min 
walk distance, and quality of life scores (KCCQ) stands in contrast to results from trials of 
intravenous iron repletion in similar patient populations.13,14,25 Also in contrast to previous 
studies with intravenous iron repletion, in this study, oral iron therapy produced minimal 
improvement in iron stores, implicating the route of administration rather than the strategy 
of iron repletion in the lack of clinical benefit. The significant relationship between higher 
baseline hepcidin levels and lack of iron repletion provides mechanistic insight into this 
study’s observed findings.
With the exception of one study that included 7 individuals randomized to oral iron,26 this is 
the first multicenter randomized clinical trial exploring the utility of oral iron 
supplementation in HFrEF patients with iron deficiency. In light of the failure of oral iron to 
improve measures of functional capacity in this study, a comparison of the patient 
populations and relative changes in iron stores to trials of intravenous iron repletion is 
warranted.

 The patient population in this study was similar to that investigated in trials of intravenous 
iron repletion (FAIR-HF and CONFIRM-HF)13,14 in patient age and BMI as well as 
underlying HF etiology and baseline pharmacotherapy.13,1413,14 In addition, baseline 
laboratory indices of iron stores were similar across the three studies. However, iron indices 
following oral, compared to intravenous iron repletion, differed markedly (eTable 3). 
Despite administering approximately 15-fold more iron orally in this study than that 
administered intravenously in FAIR-HF (i.e. 33.6g vs. ~2g), there was only a modest 3% 
median increment in Tsat and 11 ng/ml increment in ferritin in participants randomized to 
receive oral iron in this study, compared to a 70% increment in Tsat and 550% increment in 
ferritin with intravenous iron administration in the FAIR-HF Trial.13
There are several potential explanations for failure of oral iron to improve iron stores and 
exercise capacity in this trial. Hepcidin plays a critical role in inhibiting iron 
absorption.18–21 In this study, patients with higher baseline hepcidin levels demonstrated 
reduced Tsat and ferritin augmentation and an attenuated fall in soluble transferrin receptor 
levels in response to 16 weeks of oral iron (Figure 2). Taken together, these findings indicate 
that higher hepcidin levels may limit responsiveness to oral iron. Expected hepcidin levels in 
individuals with iron deficiency and anemia are below the values measured in this study.27,28
Other potential mediators of refractoriness to oral iron in heart failure seem less likely to 
have affected our findings. Use of anticoagulants and anti-platelet agents was prevalent but 
the rate of expected loss of iron (1-1.5mg/day) is markedly below the repletion dose (300 
mg/day) administered. Therefore, in the absence of overt gastrointenstinal bleeding, which 
did not occur in any of the patients treated with oral iron during the trial, blood loss would 
not be expected to account for the observed minimal increases in iron stores with oral iron 
treatment.
The choice of iron polysaccharide formulation for this study was based on its offering the 
highest dose of elemental iron among available oral supplements, coupled with its tolerance 
profile to aid compliance and minimize risk of unblinding participants. Polysaccharide iron 
preparations have been shown to provide comparable iron repletion to iron salts.29–31 
Recommended daily oral iron intake is 8-18 mg. Hence, even after accounting for limited 
gastrointestinal iron absorption, the 20-fold increase in oral iron exposure compared to 
recommended daily intake served to adequately test the hypothesis that oral iron 
supplementation would improve iron stores and functional capacity in HFrEF. The low 
incidence of oral iron discontinuation, which was 14% among patients receiving iron and 
15% in the placebo group, argues against the observed findings being related to lack of 
compliance with oral iron.
The selection of change in peak VO2 for the primary endpoint, as previously described,15 
was based on the fact that peak VO2 is the gold standard indicator of functional capacity in 
heart failure and has been shown to improve with iron repletion in non-heart failure 
populations. The lack of treatment effect on quality of life, NT-pro BNP and other 
physiologic end points is consistent with the observed lack of treatment effect on maximal 
exercise capacity. The exploratory endpoint, change in VO2 at the ventilatory threshold, 
showed a 5% increment in the iron group and no change in placebo, though the study may

 have been underpowered for this modest between-group difference to reach significance 
(p=0.08). Submaximum exercise capacity, indicative of endurance and independent of 
volitional effort, may be more sensitive to subtle changes in iron bioavailability, as opposed 
to peak VO2.8
Recognition of the high prevalence of iron deficiency (~50%) in patients with HFrEF and 
the consistent clinical benefit demonstrated in studies with intravenous iron repletion is 
motivating clinicians to prescribe iron supplementation. Based on the low cost and 
widespread availability of oral iron, and the logistical challenges with repeated 
administration of intravenous iron to outpatients with HF, this trial complements recent 
studies on intravenous iron treatment in informing the appropriate approach to iron repletion 
in HFrEF. This study’s findings of minimal changes in iron stores and lack of effect on peak 
exercise capacity suggests that prescription of oral iron in patients with HFrEF offers no 
benefit. However, the correlates observed between baseline iron indices and exercise 
capacity, as well as changes in Tsat being related to improvement in peak VO2 are consistent 
with results of recent trials suggesting beneficial effects of intravenous iron on functional 
capacity in HFrEF.
This study has some important limitations. This study was not powered to detect differences 
in clinical events or safety endpoints. There was also no direct comparison of intravenous 
and oral iron repletion. Given the relatively short duration of the trial, it is possible that 
longer duration or higher dose of exposure may have led to more significant improvement in 
iron stores and increased exercise capacity, particularly among those patients with 
appropriately low hepcidin levels. In addition, this study was confined to patients with 
HFrEF and findings may differ in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
Conclusions
Among patients with iron deficiency and HFrEF, high-dose oral iron minimally augmented 
iron stores and did not improve exercise capacity over 16 weeks. These findings do not 
support the use of oral iron supplementation to treat iron deficiency in patients with HFrEF.

 Key Points
Question
Does therapy with oral iron improve exercise capacity in patients with heart failure and 
iron deficiency?
Findings
In this randomized clinical trial of 225 adults with heart failure and reduced ejection 
fraction, oral iron polysaccharide minimally repleted iron stores and had no significant 
effect on exercise capacity at 16 weeks compared with placebo (+23ml/min vs. −2 ml/
min, respectively).
Meaning
These findings do not support the use of oral iron supplementation in patients with heart 
failure and iron deficiency and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.
