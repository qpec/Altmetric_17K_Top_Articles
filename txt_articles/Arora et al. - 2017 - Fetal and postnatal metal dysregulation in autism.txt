Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the etiologies of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), but evidence of specific environmental exposures and susceptibility windows is
limited. Here we study monozygotic and dizygotic twins discordant for ASD to test whether
fetal and postnatal metal dysregulation increases ASD risk. Using validated tooth-matrix
biomarkers, we estimate pre- and post-natal exposure profiles of essential and toxic ele-
ments. Significant divergences are apparent in metal uptake between ASD cases and their
control siblings, but only during discrete developmental periods. Cases have reduced uptake
of essential elements manganese and zinc, and higher uptake of the neurotoxin lead. Man-
ganese and lead are also correlated with ASD severity and autistic traits. Our study suggests
that metal toxicant uptake and essential element deficiency during specific developmental
windows increases ASD risk and severity, supporting the hypothesis of systemic elemental
dysregulation in ASD. Independent replication in population-based studies is needed to
extend these findings.

 A
utism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1–2% of all
children born in Europe, North America and other
developed regions, and is defined by persistent alterations
in social communication and interaction alongside restricted,
repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests or activities1. ASD
causes significant impairment in social, occupational or other
important areas of functioning1,2. Psychiatric comorbidity is
common,
including
attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
(ADHD), affecting up to 30% of children with ASD3. Heritable
factors account for at least 50% of ASD risk with the remainder
attributable to environmental factors acting alone or through
interaction with genetics4,5. While substantial progress has been
made in identifying genetic determinants of autism risk6
environmental
factors,
especially
modifiable
environmental
exposures, remain understudied.
Fetal and early childhood exposure to toxic metals and
deficiencies of nutritional elements have been linked with several
adverse developmental outcomes frequently associated with ASD,
including intellectual disability, and language, attentional and
behavioural problems7. Animal studies have demonstrated that
the effects of various metals on brain development could be
mediated through dysregulation in neurotransmission, and
alterations in frontal and subcortical brain structures8, several
of which have also been implicated in ASD9. Therefore,
environmental and dietary exposure to metals are potentially
important etiological factors in ASD9.
Studies of toxic metals and nutritional elements in ASD have
yielded mixed results. Although several studies reported higher
concentrations of toxic metals in ASD, including the neurotoxin
lead, others found no association10. However, previous research
shows methodological shortcomings that limit interpretation and
generalizability of the findings. First, elemental exposure has
frequently been estimated using concentrations in blood or other
biomarkers post-diagnosis11. Second, most previous studies
recruited patient series rather than enroling participants from
the
population.
Third,
assessing
the
contribution
of
environmental factors in the etiology of ASD needs control for
genetic
factors.
Investigating
family
members,
especially
contrasting discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins, is a powerful
strategy for uncovering disease-associated environmental factors
independent of underlying genomic sequence variation12.
Given these methodological restraints and the high likelihood
of metal exposure in the environment7, rigorous research is
required that provides a more accurate assessment of the role of
metals in the etiology of ASD. To that goal, we developed tooth-
matrix biomarkers that directly measure fetal and postnatal
exposure
to
multiple
metals,
and
recruited
twins
from
population-based cohorts from whom naturally shed deciduous
teeth could be collected. We enroled 26.3% of the base study
population of the Roots of Autism and ADHD Twin Study in
Sweden (RATSS) through a non-random selection process
(Fig. 1). RATSS applies deep phenotyping on a significant
subset (currently 11.3%) of all ASD discordant twins in Sweden in
the specified age range13. Importantly, since the RATSS only
recruits participants older than 8 years, and children only shed
teeth until the age of 12 years, the study we report here represents
50% of the RATSS base population who are of tooth-shedding
age. In addition to our primary study in RATSS, we were able to
obtain teeth from an ASD-discordant DZ twin pair in the United
States, which were analysed separately (Supplementary Material).
The teeth samples we collected from the twins were analysed
using recently developed and rigorously validated tooth-matrix
biomarkers, which objectively reconstruct fetal and early post-
natal exposure to multiple metals with detailed temporal
resolution14–19.
We
have
developed
these
direct
fetal
biomarkers that can be collected at the time of diagnosis in
childhood and provide time-series data from the second trimester
onwards on multiple metal exposures (overview of these
biomarkers shown in Fig. 2)14. We tested the hypothesis that
prenatal and early life exposure to metal toxicants or deficiency of
essential elements during critical developmental windows are
associated with ASD. Our primary focus was on lead, an
established neurotoxicant that has been implicated in ASD20,
and manganese, an essential nutrient with emerging evidence of
neurotoxicity21. Both these elements have been associated with
attentional and behavioural outcomes relevant to ASD7,21. We
also examined zinc, an essential element that is critical for the
maintenance of health and central to the regulation of many
metal
transport
mechanisms22.
Moreover,
we
undertook
exploratory analysis of seven other elements.
Results
Participant characteristics. We recruited twins from nation-wide
twin registries and by advertisements in Sweden (see Methods
section and Fig. 1)23,24. Characteristics of the study sample are
presented in Table 1. A total of 154 twin pairs had participated in
RATSS as of September 2016, which includes 11.3% of all ASD
discordant twins in Sweden in the specified age range13. From
those participants, this study included 32 complete twin pairs and
12 individuals from twin pairs whose sibling did not donate a
tooth. Out of the 32 complete twin pairs, 17 were MZ pairs and
15 DZ pairs including two opposite-sex pairs.
Metal distributions in typically developing and ASD twins. Our
tooth-matrix biomarkers provide time-series data on uptake of
multiple elements from the second trimester to early childhood.
Figure 3 shows typical elemental distributions we observed in
teeth of ASD cases and controls. We first examined distribu-
tions of elements in non-ASD MZ twins to establish char-
acteristic metal uptake patterns at different developmental
times. Figure 3a shows close concordance for lead, manganese
and zinc in non-ASD control MZ twins (other elements show a
similar pattern, Supplementary Fig. 3). The observed metal
distributions were in agreement with previous studies using
tooth-matrix biomarkers14,19. Specifically, manganese levels
declined rapidly over the
prenatal period to birth and
continued to decrease at a slower rate postnatally. Zinc levels
were steady prenatally in our sample teeth with a marked
decrease around birth. There is no typical distribution of lead in
teeth related to developmental age.
Examining
distribution
of
elements
between
MZ
twins
discordant for ASD revealed a non-characteristic pattern of
element-specific differences (Fig. 3b shows typical examples).
Manganese levels were lower in the affected twin pre- and
postnatally. A complex pattern emerged for zinc; in non-ASD co-
twins there was a decline in zinc around birth but in ASD cases
this drop in zinc levels occurred earlier during the prenatal period
and
subsequently
zinc
levels
showed
a
marked
increase
postnatally, surpassing the levels in their non-ASD co-twins.
Lead levels were generally higher in the affected twin and this
difference was greatest after birth. In an ASD discordant DZ twin
sample recruited from an autism clinic in the United States, we
found similar differences in zinc and manganese between the
ASD-affected and healthy twin (see Supplementary Fig. 2). In MZ
pairs concordant for ASD (Fig. 3c), the differences in metal
distribution amongst twins were smaller than those observed in
discordant pairs.

 the analysis of time-series data, particularly useful to study the
effect of an exposure at a certain time point while adjusting for all
the past (lagged) values of that exposure25. We adjusted our
analysis for important covariates and also applied two levels of
stringent
corrections.
First,
we
adjusted
for
intra-twin
correlations and second, we used a Holm–Bonferroni correction
to account for multiple comparisons (Methods section). In this
manner, we identified specific developmental periods when metal
levels varied between ASD discordant twins (7 pairs), after
accounting for the difference between control twins (19 pairs;
Fig. 4). We defined the critical developmental window for a metal
and ASD as that region of the DLM graph where the intra-twin
corrected association did not contain zero (blue bands in Fig. 4).
Statistical
significance
is
represented
by
Holm–Bonferroni
confidence intervals (CI; vertical bars in Fig. 4).
When comparing ASD discordant twins with non-ASD control
twin pairs, we found that lead levels were consistently higher in
ASD cases than their non-ASD co-twins from 20 weeks before
birth to 30 weeks after birth. However, after adjusting for intra-
twin correlations, this association was only evident between weeks
10 to 20 postnatally. The greatest difference was observed at 15
weeks postnatally, when lead levels in ASD cases were 1.5 times
higher (Holm–Bonferroni 95% CI 0.9–2.5) than in their co-twins,
after taking into account average difference in control twins.
Manganese levels were consistently lower in ASD cases, and this
was statistically significant over two critical windows; between 10
weeks prenatally to birth and subsequently postnatal weeks 5–20.
The greatest difference was observed at postnatal week 15 when
cases had 2.5 times lower manganese than their co-twins (Holm–
Bonferroni 95% CI 1.1–4.5 times lower). Differences of a similar
magnitude were also observed 7 weeks before birth. ASD cases
were also deficient in zinc from 10 weeks prenatally to B5 weeks
postnatally, with the ASD cases showing 28% lower (or 1.28 times
lower) levels than their co-twins 8 weeks prenatally (Holm–
Bonferroni 95% CI 22–65% lower).
Concordant pairs, where both twins have ASD, are expected to
be more alike in their metal status than discordant pairs.
Therefore, in a sensitivity analyses, we compared ASD discordant
twin pairs with ASD concordant twins (six pairs) and observed
similar patterns to our comparison of ASD discordant versus
control pairs, including significantly higher lead levels in cases
(Fig. 5). Furthermore, in exploratory analysis, we observed
divergence between ASD cases and their co-twins in the other
metals we examined. Levels of tin were higher in ASD cases and
this difference was statistically significant between 20 and 16
weeks before birth (Supplementary Fig. 4). Strontium was higher
in cases throughout the period of study and this difference was
most prominent during weeks 22–30 after birth. Chromium was
lower in cases than their control co-twins, with differences being
greatest from 20 to 15 weeks prenatally. Overall, our analyses
showed broad pre- and postnatal case-control differences, for six
of ten metals examined under our hypothesis-driven and
exploratory analysis.
Correlation of metals with ASD traits and clinical severity. We
examined if early life metal dysregulation had long-lasting effects
on various clinical measures of ASD and autistic traits. To test
this, we correlated our tooth-matrix biomarkers with the severity
of ASD and autistic traits measured approximately a decade later
using
established
clinical
assessments
(Autism
Diagnostic
Observation Schedule Second Edition (ADOS-2), and Social
Responsiveness Scale Second Edition (SRS-2), respectively). Lead
and manganese showed statistically significant associations with
ADOS-2 or SRS-2 (Fig. 6). Manganese was inversely associated
with autistic traits measured using SRS-2 (strongest association at
15 weeks, r ¼ � 0.25, 95% CI � 0.40 to � 0.10) and ASD severity
on ADOS-2 (strongest association at 12 weeks, r ¼ � 0.20, 95%
CI � 0.35 to � 0.05). Lead concentrations were positively asso-
ciated with ADOS-2 and SRS-2 scores. The association with
ADOS-2 was statistically significant from 10 weeks before birth to
30 weeks after birth, with strongest association 5 weeks prenatally
(r ¼ 0.40, 95% CI 0.20–0.60). Zinc and other metals analysed
under exploratory analysis were not significantly associated with
SRS-2 and ADOS-2.
Discussion
Using tooth-matrix biomarkers, which measure the uptake of
multiple elements at a fine temporal resolution during early
development, and a well-characterized sample of twins, we
observed significant differences between ASD cases and non-ASD
controls during specific pre- and postnatal periods. In ASD cases,
higher lead levels were observed over the prenatal period and first
5
months
postnatally.
Levels
of
essential
elements
were
diminished in cases at specific developmental windows. Zinc
levels were lower in cases during the third trimester, while
manganese levels were consistently lower in cases both pre- and
postnatally, and this deficiency was highest 4 months after birth.
Differences between cases and controls were also evident for
multiple other elements examined in our exploratory analysis,
including tin, strontium and chromium. The developmental
period of maximal difference between cases and controls varied

 for each element. Even a decade after the exposure, we observed
moderate but statistically significant correlations between two of
three metals examined under primary hypothesis and ASD severity
and autistic traits across the entire sample. Taken together, this
supports the
hypothesis that
prenatal and early childhood
disruption (excess or deficiency) of multiple metals during critical
developmental windows is associated with ASD, and suggests a role
for elemental dysregulation in the etiology of ASD.
The influence of common genetic factors in ASD is estimated
to be at least 50% (ref. 4), however currently etiologic genetic
variants can be found in B16 to 50% of affected children,
suggesting important roles for environmental factors that have
not yet been confirmed4,6. Among the large number of possible
environmental exposures, metal toxicants and essential elements
have received some attention9. For example, one study that
compared hair metal concentrations of ASD cases with literature
reference values was suggestive of reduced zinc and magnesium
and elevated levels of toxicants including lead26. Similarly, higher
blood lead levels have been reported in ASD cases11, but in those
studies it is possible that the uptake of metal toxicants or
nutritional deficiencies are a consequence of autism-related
behaviours and do not necessarily reflect a causal exposure

used teeth from ASD cases to measure cumulative exposure to
metals, but those studies ground whole teeth not taking advantage
of the incremental microstructure that provides detailed temporal
information28. They found no significant differences in lead, zinc
or manganese between cases and controls. Our sample included

 the timing of exposure during discrete developmental periods
over the pre-and postnatal periods.
Early signs of ASD first manifest 6–12 months after birth29,
suggesting a narrow window for environmental factors to
contribute to ASD risk. Our results support this hypothesis, as
the timing of divergence between ASD cases and their co-twins in
lead, zinc and manganese was evident prenatally and in the early
postnatal period. These differences at specific developmental
periods in early life for a range of toxic and essential elements
suggest
that
there
are
multiple
mechanisms
leading
to
dysregulation, and endorse the higher vulnerability of the mid-
to
late-fetal
period
to
the
pathophysiological
mechanisms
underlying ASD.
Our findings along with other recent studies bolster the
premise of joint interaction of environmental exposures with
genetic variations in the etiology of ASD. Notably, many of the
genes associated with ASD are also linked with elemental
homeostasis9,30, and it is intriguing that genes implicated in
ASD converge to specific neuronal co-expression networks
especially during the same critical early developmental periods
we have observed in this study31–33. Furthermore, the capacity of
the brain to regulate metals varies with developmental age
suggesting in utero fluctuations in expression of metal transporter
genes.
Transcriptional
alterations
in response
to chemical
exposures that mimic changes seen in brain samples from
autism patients have also been reported recently34.
A mechanistic framework of prenatal elemental dysregulation in
ASD should consider the maternal–fetal interface, epigenetic
modification of genes coding for metal transporters, and the central
role of zinc in regulating homeostasis of multiple metals. Recent
evidence from human and animal studies suggests that under stress,
placental transfer of nutrients to the fetus is disrupted, and factors
such as prenatal stress and placental inflammation increase
hyperactivity in offspring35,36. In the case of MZ twins sharing a
placenta, external stressors that affect only one twin may induce
epigenetic modification; notably, in one study fetal zinc deficiency-
induced epigenetic alterations in the gene coding for the metal
transporter, metallothionein-2 (ref. 37). In this regard, it is
important to consider the central role of zinc as a regulator of
multiple
metal
homeostasis
pathways
from
early
in
the
transcriptional process to the optimal functioning of metal
transporters9. Therefore, upstream factors such as placental
insufficiency and epigenetic alterations of metal transporters may
disrupt
zinc
homeostasis
initiating
a
cascade
of
elemental
dysregulation which, in the presence of genetic predisposition,
raises the risk of ASD. Overall, it is likely that alterations in metal
regulation in our ASD cases involve multiple disruptions along the
complex networks that regulate elemental uptake and distribution.

 This study has multiple strengths, such as the inclusion of an
informative
twin
sample
recruited
from
population-based
cohorts, a rigorous diagnostic assessment, and the use of direct
fetal biomarkers. Limitations of the study are a relatively small
non-random sample, although the sample size was adequate to
uncover significant associations after stringent statistical adjust-
ments, and our twin sample represented a significant subsample
(11.3%) of the total population of twins discordant for ASD in
Sweden in the examined age range13. In addition, the inclusion of
twins offsets the potential lower power as it allows rigorous
control for underlying genetic variation. Nevertheless, caution
should
be
exercised
when
generalizing
our
findings,
and
additional
studies
are
needed
in
different
populations,
particularly larger non-twin ASD samples to corroborate our
findings, and differentiate genetic and non-genetic contributions
in understanding the relation between metals and ASD. Our
biomarkers, while providing a direct measure of fetal exposure, do
not measure exposure during the first trimester. Furthermore,
while the differences we observe between cases and controls
precede the onset of ASD symptoms, these data do not establish
causality. Our tooth-biomarkers measure uptake of metals from
all sources but do not distinguish specific routes of exposure such
as diet. Our study also highlights a need to study the kinetics of
metal mixtures during fetal and early postnatal development as
we noted substantial shifts in metal levels between the pre-and
post-natal periods. Most studies on the clearance and half-life of
metals in humans are undertaken on adults and not newborns.
Heterogeneous distribution of metals in enamel and dentine can
occur in response to variable environmental exposures, changes
in diet and due to age-dependent metabolic changes, and has
been observed in humans and other mammals38.
In conclusion, using novel biomarkers of early life exposure, we
observed differences in uptake of multiple toxic and essential
elements over the second and third trimesters and early postnatal
periods in MZ and DZ twins discordant for ASD. The critical
developmental windows for the observed discrepancies varied for
each element, suggesting that systemic elemental dysregulation
may serve an important role in ASD etiology.
Methods
Study design and participants. Participating twins in this study are part of
RATSS recruited between 2011 and 2016 (ref. 23). The study was approved by the
Swedish National Ethical Review Board and all participants gave written informed
consent. Potential twin participants for the RATSS are identified through nation-
wide registries, including the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden24, a
population-based study of all twins born in Sweden since 1992 in which all twins
are screened at age nine using the Autism, Tics, ADHD and other Comorbidities
Inventory (A-TAC). Participants are identified through linking the Swedish Twin
Registry to other National registries such as the Swedish National Patient Register,
and regional clinical registers in Stockholm County (Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry [‘Pastill’], Habilitation & Health Centers) that include ICD-10
diagnostic information39–41. Finally, potential participants are also identified
through national Swedish societies for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) as
well as advertisements and summons in the media. Even though the recruitment is
done through different routes, 480% of the twins in RATSS are present in the
Swedish twin registries.
Twin pairs were recruited into the RATSS either based on discordance for ASD
(42 points differences on the A-TAC autism subscale equalling B1s.d.);
concordance for ASD (both twins reaching cut-off on the A-TAC autism scale);
or concordance for no NDD (both twins under cut-offs for all NDD subscale on
the A-TAC). For other sources of recruitment, the twins are invited if at least
one twin has an ICD-10 diagnosis of autism (F84.0), Asperger syndrome (F84.5) or
atypical autism/pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-
NOS) (F84.1, F84.8, F84.9), or a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of ASD (either parent- or registry
reported). All potential participants undergo a telephone interview by a research
nurse checking eligibility before invitation for assessment in RATSS. Participants in
our study had additional diagnosis of NDD. In ASD discordant twins, six (86%)
ASD twins and one (13%) co-twin had a diagnosis of other NDD. Ten ASD
concordant twins, but only 8 (31%) individuals among the non-ASD twins, had a
NDD.
Zygosity was determined by genotyping of saliva or whole-blood-derived DNA
using standard methods. The genotyping was done using Infinium Human-
CoreExome chip (Illumina Inc., USA). The estimating identity by descent was
analysed using the PLINK software (v1.07)42 after quality control and removal of
SNPs with minor allele frequency o0.05 within the samples. All pairs of DNA
samples showing ^
pZ0.99 were considered as monozygotic pairs. For few pairs a
short tandem repeat kit (Promega Powerplex 21) was used to determine the
zygosity.
Currently, RATSS includes 11.3% of all ASD discordant twins in Sweden in the
specified age range13. Importantly, since the RATSS study only recruits participants
older than 8 years, and children only shed teeth until the age of 12 years, the study
we report here represents 50% of the RATSS base population in the age range of
8–12 years. Finally, we recruited one ASD discordant twin pair from a clinic in the
United States whose data were analysed separately (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Clinical procedures. Medical history and sociodemographic information of the
families were collected. ASD was diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteria based
on clinical experts consensus and corroborated by results from the Autism Diag-
nostic Interview—Revised43 and the ADOS-2 (ref. 44). Clinical severity of ASD
symptoms was determined by ADOS comparison scores, and autistic traits were
measured by parent reported Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2)45 total raw
scores. General cognitive ability was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales
for Children or Adults (Fourth Editions) or the Leiter Scales and the Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test (Third Edition) in cases of low verbal abilities46–48.
Collection and analysis of biological samples. Parents/guardians collected the
naturally shed deciduous teeth at home. Teeth were brought to the study team in
person and stored at room temperature. Metal deposits in teeth are stable at room
temperature, and we have validated tooth-metal biomarkers in prospective preg-
nancy cohorts by comparing metal concentrations in teeth with other biological
and environmental matrices14–19. For example, earlier we validated prenatal lead
levels in teeth with maternal blood lead measured during the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy, and birth and childhood measures of tooth lead with lead
concentrations in umbilical cord blood and serial childhood blood measures,
respectively15. We have similarly validated metal levels in teeth against
environmental samples (house dust concentrations and distance to exposure
source, for example)16,17, and also undertaken detailed animal studies with
controlled exposures18,19.
Our approach to measuring metals in teeth using laser ablation-inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and assigning developmental
times has been detailed elsewhere14,19. Herein, teeth are sectioned and the
neonatal line (a histological feature formed in enamel and dentine at the time of
birth) and incremental markings are used to assign temporal information to
sampling points (Fig. 2). A New Wave Research NWR-193 (ESI, USA) laser
ablation unit equipped with a 193
nm ArF excimer laser was connected to an
Agilent Technologies 8800 triple-quad ICP-MS (Agilent Technologies, USA).
Helium was used as carrier gas from the laser ablation cell and mixed with argon
via Y-piece before introduction to the ICP-MS. The system was tuned daily using
NIST SRM 612 (trace elements in glass) to monitor sensitivity (maximum analyte
ion counts), oxide formation (232Th16O þ/232Th þ,o0.3%) and fractionation

 (232Th þ/238U þ, 100±5%). The laser was scanned in dentine parallel to the
dentine-enamel junction (DEJ) from the dentine horn tip towards the tooth cervix.
A pre-ablation scan was run to remove any surface contamination. Data were
analysed as metal to calcium ratios (for example, 208Pb:43Ca) to control for any
variations in mineral content within a tooth and between samples. On average,
each tooth was sampled at 152 locations. LA-ICP-MS operating parameters are
given in Table 2.
Statistical analysis. We used a variation of DLMs as our primary statistical
approach25. A DLM is a regression-based approach commonly used in the
behavioural sciences for the analysis of time-series data, particularly to study the
effect of an exposure at a certain time point while adjusting for all the past (lagged)
values of that exposure. Using DLMs, we were able to estimate the differences in
metal uptake between ASD cases and control twin pairs at discrete developmental
stages, while accounting for exposures at other time points. Specifically, we applied
DLMs to the detailed temporal data generated by the tooth-matrix biomarkers to
detect critical developmental windows between 20–30 weeks after birth for lead,
manganese and zinc (and seven other metals under exploratory analysis). We also
used DLMs to identify developmental time points when metal biomarkers were
significantly correlated with ASD severity and autistic traits.
We undertook three sets of analyses. The primary analysis determined
developmental periods when there are disparities in elemental concentrations
associated with ASD in twin pairs discordant for ASD (7 pairs) and control (non-
ASD) twin pairs (19 pairs). The parameter estimate in this analysis was the
smoothed mean differences in log concentrations of discordant pairs minus mean
differences in control pairs, that is, (Xcase � Xcontrol) � (Xcontrol-1 � Xcontrol-2). Thus,
for example, when ASD cases from the discordant pairs have higher concentrations
than their non-ASD co-twins, and these differences exceed the differences observed
in control twin pairs, the association (as measured by the beta coefficient) is
positive. In a sensitivity analysis we similarly compared ASD discordant pairs (7
pairs) with ASD concordant pairs (6 pairs). Although the sample for this analysis
was smaller it provides important support for the results of the primary analysis as
the discordant versus concordant twin comparison provides additional control for
confounders. Finally, we examined correlations between element concentrations
and ADOS-2 and SRS-2 scores using data from all participants (ASD-discordant,
ASD concordant and control twins and individuals whose twin did not participate
(n ¼ 76)). All models were adjusted for covariates including sex, zygosity,
gestational age, the average birth weight of the twin pairs and the s.d. of the birth
weight within the twin pair. We used average birth weight and s.d. in our models as
our unit of analysis is a twin pair, and we wanted to adjust for differences within a
twin pair since even monozygotic twins can have different birth weights. For the
parameter estimates, associated time-varying 95% CIs were calculated,
corresponding to a statistical test on the two-sided 5% level of significance. We
applied two additional corrections; first, we adjusted for intra-twin correlations
through a random effect term per twin pair and, second, we used a Holm–
Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons. Additional details of
the statistical methods are in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1.
