1. Introduction
In the USA, over 100 million patients suffer from chronic pain [36]. On average, 261–300 
billion dollars are spent annually to manage pain and 297–336 billion dollars are lost to 
work nonproductivity [36]. Additionally, the emotional tax from chronic pain has resulted in 
life altering events ranging from shattering family unity [72] to suicide attempts [26; 29; 32]. 
Options for treatment of acute, post-operative pain as well as for chronic pain are limited 
and many drugs are marginally effective [22] and often accompanied by severe side-effects 
[19]. Non-pharmacological options for the treatment of pain would be highly desirable and 
advantageous in terms of safety, including lack of tolerance, somnolence, addiction, 
gastrointestinal disturbances and perhaps other factors such as convenience and cost.
Light therapy has been reported to be useful for multiple medical conditions. For example, 
light therapy, has been used to control depression [20; 25], to increase daytime circadian 
stimulation, and to improve sleep quality and mitigate depression in Alzheimer’s disease 
[21]. Additionally, bright light improved the mood of adolescents taking antidepressants 
compared to those without light therapy [61]. Exposing patients to bright light of more than

 6000 lux significantly improved seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a serious condition with 
increased risk of suicidality [20; 25]. Pain has sensory, cognitive and affective dimensions 
[9; 58]. The emotional state of patients significantly influences pain [24]. For example, 
chronic psychological stress and depression increased pain perception in humans when 
painful and non-painful heat stimulus were applied to their forearms [76]. A similar 
response is also reported in rodents. In a model of social defeat, rats demonstrated enhanced 
nociceptive response to subcutaneous formalin administration [2]. In contrast, elevated 
emotional status may decrease the perception of pain [46]; general happiness and laughter 
therapy significantly decreased chronic pain scores in elderly patients [79]. Similar findings 
were observed in primary care patients who were enrolled in positive psychological 
intervention programs, which decreased their depression and improved overall functionality, 
as well as decreased pain perception [42]. It is possible that light therapy may have 
psychological effects, possibly arising from physiological changes such as increased 
endogenous opioid release, as shown in this study, which affect pain response or its 
perception.
Few studies have investigated possible effects of light therapy on pain. A randomized 
clinical trial investigated the effect of bright light exposure in managing nonspecific back 
pain where patients received once a week light exposure for 3 weeks reduced pain as assed 
by the Brief Pain Inventory suggesting an active role for light in controlling pain [43]. 
Preclinical studies on the possible modulation of pain by light therapy have not been 
reported. Here, we investigated the effect of light in modulation of acute nociception as well 
as in a model of chronic neuropathic pain. We found that green light produced 
antinociceptive and antihyperalgesic effects that involved descending, opioid-sensitive 
inhibition.
2. Methods
2.1. Animals
Pathogen-free, adult male and female Sprague–Dawley as well as male Long Evans rats 
(weight at testing 250–350 g; Harlan–Sprague–Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were housed in a 
climate-controlled room on a 12-h light/dark cycle and were allowed to have food and water 
ad libitum. All procedures were approved by the University of Arizona Animal Care and 
Use Committee and conform to the guidelines for the use of laboratory animals of the 
National Institutes of Health (publication no. 80–23, 1966). All behavioral experiments were 
conducted by experimenters blinded to the treatment conditions. The experiments were 
replicated a minimum of two times with independent cohorts of animals.
2.2. Chemicals
All experimental compounds, doses, sources, and catalog numbers are described in Table 1.
2.3. Light Emitting Diodes (LED)
All visible spectrum LED flex strips were purchased from ledsupply.com (VT, USA). The 
specification of the LED were: (i) #LS-AC60-6-BL, 472 nanometer wavelength (i.e., blue), 8 
watts, 120 Volts, 120 degree beam angle; (ii) #LS-AC60-6-GR, 525 nanometer wavelength

 (i.e., green), 8 watts, 120 Volts, 120 degree beam angle; and (iii) #LS-AC60-66-WH, white, 
9.6 watts, 120 Volts, 120 degree beam angle. LED strips were affixed to the outside of clear 
plastic cages that housed the rats so as to avoid the strips from being chewed. Rats were 
exposed to the various LED in these cages with full access to food and water in a dark room 
devoid of any other source of light. Following behavioral assessment, the rats were returned 
to their cages for additional LED exposure. At the end of daily testing, the rats were returned 
to their regular animal room where they were exposed to room light (regular florescent 
bulbs). A lux meter (Tondaj LX1010B, Amazon.com) was used to determine the illuminance 
and luminous emittance of the LED strips.
Since there are no previously published data reporting the effects of green LED on 
antinociception in rats, as a first step, we performed ‘pilot’ experiments using a fixed 
amount (330 lux – which represents one full ‘strip’) of green LED over time noting that 
antinociception developed only after 3 to 5 hours of exposure for at least three days. This 
antinociception continued to gradually increase over the next two days of exposure, reaching 
its zenith between days 4 and 5 (data not shown). The bulk of the studies were thus 
performed with 8 hours daily exposure for 5 days. Next, we performed a light intensity 
versus antinociception analysis, which revealed that lower lux intensity was more effective 
than higher lux exposure for 8 hours daily for 5 days. These pilot experiments formed the 
basis of the exposure paradigm used in these studies – lux level, number of hours of 
exposure per day, and number of days of exposure.
2.4. Thermal sensory thresholds
Paw withdrawal latencies were determined as described by Hargreaves et al. [28] was used. 
Rats were acclimated within Plexiglas enclosures on a clear glass plate maintained at 30°C. 
A radiant heat source (high-intensity projector lamp) was focused onto the plantar surface of 
the hind paw. When the paw was withdrawn, a motion detector halted the stimulus and a 
timer. A maximal cutoff of 33.5 sec was used to prevent tissue damage.
2.5. Tactile thresholds
The assessment of tactile sensory thresholds was determined by measuring the withdrawal 
response to probing the hindpaw with a series of calibrated fine (von Frey) filaments. Each 
filament was applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the paw of rats held in 
suspended wire mesh cages. Withdrawal threshold was determined by sequentially 
increasing and decreasing the stimulus strength (the “up and down” method), and data were 
analyzed with the nonparametric method of Dixon, as described by Chaplan et al. [12] and 
expressed as the mean withdrawal threshold.
2.6. Elevated plus maze (EPM)
The EPM consists of four elevated (50cm) arms (50cm long and 10cm wide) with two 
opposing arms containing 30cm high opaque walls. EPM testing occurred in a quiet testing 
room with ambient lighting at ~500 lux. On day of testing, rats were allowed to acclimate to 
the testing room for 20 minutes. Each rat was placed in a closed arm, facing the enter 
platform and cage mates started in the same closed arm. Each rat was allowed 5 minute to 
explore the EPM and then returned to its home cage. Between animals the EPM was cleaned

 thoroughly with Versa-Clean (Fisher Scientific). EPM performance was recorded using an 
overhead video camera (MHD Sport 2.0 WiFi Action Camera, Walmart.com) for later 
quantification. Open and closed arm entries were defined as the front two paws entering the 
arm, and open arm time began the moment the front paws entered the open arm and ended 
upon exit. An anxiety index was also calculated; the index combines EPM parameters into 
one unified ratio with values ranging from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating increased 
anxiety [34]. The following equation was used for calculation of the anxiety index:
2.7. Implantation of intrathecal catheters
For intrathecal drug administration, rats were implanted with catheters as described by 
Yaksh and Rudy [83]. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotactic 
device. The occipital muscles were separated from their occipital insertion and retracted 
caudally to expose the cisternal membrane at the base of the skull. Polyethylene tubing was 
passed caudally from the cisterna magna to the level of the lumbar enlargement. Animals 
were allowed to recover and were examined for evidence of neurologic injury. Animals with 
evidence of neuromuscular deficits were excluded.
2.8. Fabricating rat contact lenses and imaging of eyes post-mortem
All plastic materials were purchased from Evergreen Scale Models (Des Plaines, Illinois). 
We used the method developed by Levinson et al [71], with the following modifications. In 
brief, 0.25mm sheets were cut into 2cm2 pieces held by forceps over a 6mm ball bearing, 
shaped when malleable with a copper pipe of 9 mm internal diameter and then trimmed in to 
a truncated hemisphere with iris scissors and sanded with a fine grit and emery cloth to a 
depth of 3.5 ± 0.2mm and a base diameter of 7.0 ± 0.2mm. We used a Wellar 1095-1000watt 
dual temperature heat gun, instead of the Bunsen burner used by Levinson, as a heat source 
for the fabrication process. The rats where anesthetized using isoflurane just long enough to 
place the contact lens in their eyes and were allowed to recover from anesthesia. The rats 
were anesthetized again with isoflurane to remove the contact lens at the end of each 8 hour 
exposure.
To examine if the contact lens induced any pathological damage, at the end of the 
experiment, the corneas were excised with the small rim of the sclera and then fixed for 30 
minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline as described previously 
[63]. Next, the corneas were transferred to 30% sucrose solution until staining with Evans 
blue solution for 1 min. The Evans blue dye solution was prepared by mixing 1 ml of a 
commercially prepared 0.5% Evans blue sterile aqueous solution with 9 ml of normal saline. 
This yielded a final solution of 0.05 % Evans blue, with a pH of 6.75. After staining, the 
excess dye was removed by gently passing the tissue through two baths of normal saline 
solution. Light microscope images were obtained of the stained corneas on an Olympus 
BX51 microscope with a Hamamatsu C8484 digital camera using a 4× UplanFL N, 0.13 
numerical aperture or a 20× UplanSApo 0.75 numerical aperture objective. The freeware

images.
2.9.1 Spinal nerve ligation (SNL)—Nerve ligation injury produces tactile allodynia and 
thermal hypersensitivity [40]. All nerve operations occurred 5 days after intrathecal catheter 
implantation. Rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in O2 anesthesia delivered at 2 
L/min (total time under anesthesia was < 60 minutes). The skin over the caudal lumbar 
region was incised and the muscles retracted. The L5 and L6 spinal nerves were exposed, 
carefully isolated, and tightly ligated with 4-0 silk distal to the dorsal root ganglion without 
limiting the use of the left hind paw of the animal. All animals were allowed 7 days to 
recover before any behavioral testing. Any animals exhibiting signs of motor deficiency 
were euthanized. Sham control rats underwent the same operation and handling as the SNL 
animals, but without the nerve ligation.
2.9.2. Rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) cannulation—Rats received a bilateral 
guide cannula (26GA,#C235-1.2mm, Plastics One Inc.) directed to the RVM. The cannula 
was placed at: −11.0 from bregma, −7.5mm from the dura and 0.6mm on either side of the 
midline. Injections were made by expelling 0.5 μl through an injection cannula protruding 1 
mm beyond the tip of the guide. Cannula placement was confirmed with 0.5μl Evans Blue 
injected into both sides of the cannula and microscopic examination of medullary sections 
and data from rats with misplaced cannula were eliminated from the experiment. Acute 
single injections into the RVM were performed by inserting an injector (Plastics One Inc 
#C235I-SPC) attached to a 2μl Hamilton syringe and expelling 0.5μl at the same 
coordinates.
2.10. Rotarod
Rats were trained to walk on a rotating rod (10 rev/min; Rotamex 4/8 device) with a 
maximal cutoff time of 180 seconds. Training was initiated by placing the rats on a rotating 
rod and allowing them to walk until they either fell off or 180 seconds was reached. This 
process was repeated 6 times and the rats were allowed to recover for 24 hours before 
beginning green LED exposure. Prior to treatment, the rats were run once on a moving rod 
in order to establish a baseline value. Assessment consisted of placing the rats on the moving 
rod and timing until either they fell off or reached a maximum of 180 seconds.
2.11.1. Samples preparation for proteomics—DRG and dorsal horn of the spinal 
cord from rats exposed to ambient light or GLED (4 lux, 5 days, 8 hours/day) were isolated 
and lysates were prepared as described above. Proteins were precipitated using 100% ice-
cold acetone and centrifuged at 15000×g at 4°C for 10 min. The pellets, containing 
solubilized proteins, were re-suspended in 100mM Tris pH=7.4, 8M urea (to eliminate 
carrying forward any salt contamination) and their protein content analyzed by mass 
spectrometry at the Arizona Proteomics Consortium after trypsin digestion.
2.11.2. Database searching—Tandem mass spectra were extracted. Charge state 
deconvolution and deisotoping were not performed. All MS/MS samples were analyzed 
using Sequest (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, version 1.3.0.339). Sequest was set

 up to search RattusNorvegicus_UniprotKB_2016_0406_cont.fasta assuming the digestion 
enzyme trypsin. Sequest was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.80 Da and a 
parent ion tolerance of 10.0 PPM. Oxidation of methionine and carbamidomethyl of cysteine 
were specified in Sequest as variable modifications.
2.11.3. Criteria for protein identification—Scaffold (version 4.5.1, Proteome Software 
Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications. 
Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 20.0% 
probability to achieve a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.1% by the Scaffold Local 
FDR algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater 
than 100.0% probability and contained at least 5 unique peptides. Protein probabilities were 
assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm [59]. Proteins that contained similar peptides and 
could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the 
principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into 
clusters. Proteins were annotated with gene ontology (GO) terms from 
gene_association.goa_uniprot [3].
2.12. Semi quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction
Semi quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed as 
described previously [8; 56]. After GLED treatment or control, rat spinal cords were 
dissected and the lumbar region isolated before flash freezing in liquid N2. The cords were 
kept at −80°C until analysis. RNA was extracted from tissues using Tri reagent (Cat# 
TR118, MRC, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, Tri reagent 
was added to the cords before homogenization. The homogenates were centrifuged at 5000 
× g for 5 min at 4°C to eliminate insoluble materials, then chloroform was added to the 
supernatants at 20 % (v/v). After centrifugation at 12000×g for 15 min at 4°C, the upper, 
RNA containing, aqueous fraction was harvested in a new tube and total RNA was 
subsequently precipitated by adding isopropanol (50 %, v/v). The precipitates were 
subjected to a final centrifugation at 20000×g for 10 min at 4°C and the RNA pellets were 
washed twice with 75% ethanol. Finally, purified RNA was resuspended in ultra-pure water 
and stored at −20°C until analysis. To generate cDNA, 2 μg of purified RNA were 
retrotranscribed using Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (Cat# EP0743, Thermo Fisher) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR analysis was performed using 5X 
HOT FIREPol Evagreen (Cat# 08-24-00020, Solis Biodyne, Estonia) on a CFX connect 
(Biorad, Hercules, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Specific primer sequences 
used are in Table 2. L27 expression was measured as a housekeeping gene to normalize 
target mRNA expression between samples. The relative mRNA level for each gene (x) 
relative to L27 mRNA (internal control) was calculated using the ΔΔCt method [48].
2.13. Data analysis
The statistical significance of differences between means was determined by parametric 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc comparisons (Student-Newman-Keuls 
test) using GraphPad Software. Animal numbers required to achieve statistical power for 
each in vivo experiment were determined by G.Power3.1, using post-hoc variance estimates 
from pilot experiments. Pharmacological profiling of sensory neurons data was analyzed

 using Sigma Plot 12.5 and compared by z-test. Differences were considered to be significant 
if p≤ 0.05. All data were plotted in GraphPad Prism 6.
3. Results
3.1. Antinociceptive effects of GLED
We first determined if various kinds of light conditions affected responses to a noxious 
thermal stimulus in naïve rats. Rats were exposed, for eight hours, to ambient room light that 
consisted of white fluorescent lights and ambient sunlight through glass windows (600 lux), 
white LED (575 lux), or darkness (0 lux) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) was measured 
immediately after termination of illumination. As shown in Fig. 1, the PWLs were 
unchanged across all conditions. In contrast, naïve rats exposed to GLED (525 nm 
wavelength; 110 lux) for eight hours daily for five days demonstrated a time-dependent 
increase in PWL that was significantly higher than rats exposed to ambient room light. 
Testing was done immediately after termination of GLED (Fig. 1). PWLs were also higher 
in rats exposed to blue LED (472 nm wavelength; 110 lux) but less than in those rats 
exposed to GLED (Fig 1). The increase in PWLs, elicited by GLED exposure (Fig. 2A), 
plateaued by the second day and was unchanged thereafter until the fifth day (Fig. 2B). The 
GLED exposure was terminated on day 5 and the PWLs were measured on subsequent days 
to determine if the increase in PWLs was transient or long-lasting. The increase in PWLs 
induced by GLED exposure was maintained for 4 days before returning to baseline (Fig. 
2B).
The preceding experiments were conducted with 110 lux GLED. However, whether this lux 
level was sufficient to elicit the antinociceptive behavior is not known. Consequently, we 
exposed the rats to GLED spanning several lux intensities. Exposing rats for eight hours to 4 
lux GLED levels was sufficient for increasing PWLs compared with non-exposed rats (Fig. 
3). Similar levels of PWLs were observed with rats exposed to 12, 36, or 110 lux GLED 
levels (Fig. 3). Exposure of rats to GLED 330 lux level significantly increased PWLs 
compared to baseline ambient-light exposed rats but resulted in only a half-maximal 
response when compared to the other lux conditions (Fig. 3). As the 4 lux GLED exposure 
for 8 hours was sufficient for achieving maximal antinociception, we used this lux level for 
all subsequent experiments.
We also tested if prolonged exposure to GLED could elicit tolerance to the antinociceptive 
effect. Rats exposed to GLED for an additional 7 days past the initial 5 days exposure (4 lux, 
8 hr/day) – total of 12 days of GLED exposure – did not develop tolerance (Fig. 3B). This is 
in contrast to published data with morphine where analgesic tolerance can be observed 
within 3 days [67] and causes rats to be hyperalgesic within 5 days [82].
3.2. Characterization of the role of the visual system in the antinociceptive effects of GLED
We determined whether the mechanism of GLED-induced antinociception requires direct 
activation of the visual pathway by fashioning dark opaque plastic contact lenses that 
permitted no light penetration (confirmed by measuring light intensity). These were fitted 
onto the rats’ eyes under anesthesia. As a control, transparent clear lenses were also installed

 onto control rats’s eyes. The application of contact lenses did not alter the baseline paw 
withdrawal latency. Both groups of rats were then exposed to GLED for eight hours daily for 
five days and their PWLs were monitored. Following this exposure paradigm, rats fitted with 
the dark, opaque contact lenses failed to develop antinociception, whereas rats fitted with 
clear, transparent contact lenses developed antinociception similar to rats with no contacts 
(Fig. 4A). Consistent with the importance of the visual system in the development of GLED-
induced antinociception, rats fitted for eight hours with “green” contacts that permit light 
transmission in the green part of the visual spectrum (Fig. 4B), developed antinociception 
when exposed to room light (Fig. 4C). Importantly, histological analysis of the eyes of the 
rats at the end of the experiments revealed no damage caused by either contact lens (data not 
shown). These results support a role for the visual system in mediating the GLED mediated 
antinociception.
To test if pigmented skin is involved in the antinociceptive effects of GLED, we selected 
pigmented Long Evans (LE) rat, which are different from the albino Sprague-Dawley (SD) 
rats that lack pigmentation. A similar level of antinociception was observed in SD or LE rats 
exposed to GLED for eight hours daily for five days; the PWLs were significantly higher 
than the respective strains exposed to ambient light (Fig. 5). The antinociception was not 
restricted to male rats as female SD rats exposed to the same GLED paradigm also exhibited 
increased PWLs (Fig. 5). Collectively, these results suggest that pigmentation is not 
important for developing antinociception.
3.3. Pharmacological characterization of the antinociceptive effects of GLED
The mechanisms that might underlie the antinociceptive effects of GLED were investigated 
by determining possible contributions of endogenous pain transmitters and circuits as well as 
mediators of stress. Naïve rats exposed to GLED for eight hours daily for five days received 
antagonists immediately after light termination and then PWLs were measured 20–30 
minutes later. The GLED-induced antinociception was reversed, to baseline levels, following 
a subcutaneous administration of the opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist naloxone (20 mg/kg 
i.p.). Twenty μg, intrathecal (i.t.) of naloxone also reversed the antinociception (Fig. 6A). 
These results suggest that GLED exposure likely elicits antinociception via release of 
endogenous opioids.
Neurons within the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) are known to project to the spinal 
or medullary dorsal horns to directly or indirectly enhance or diminish nociceptive traffic 
[85]. We examined the possible contribution of the RVM in the GLED-induced 
antinociceptive response by microinjection of 2% lidocaine. RVM lidocaine reversed the 
development of antinociception when the rats were exposed to GLED (Fig. 6B).
While our data thus far suggests a role for the endogenous opioid system, it is possible that 
the exposure conditions may result in stress-induced analgesia that could involve the 
sympathetic nervous system with engagement of alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors by nor-
epinephrine or epinephrine [5; 10; 44; 50; 74; 78]. Thus, to elucidate the role of the 
adrenergic system, several adrenergic receptors antagonists were tested including 
phenoxybenzamine (1 mg/kg i.p), a nonselective irreversible alpha-blocker; phentolamine (3 
mg/kg i.p), a nonselective reversible alpha-blocker; and propranolol (10 mg/kg s.c.), a

 nonselective beta-blocker. All of these drugs given immediately after light termination and 
tested 15–20 minutes afterwards failed to prevent or reverse the antinociceptive effect of 
GLED (Fig. 7A). Additionally, rats exposed to GLED or ambient light were observed to 
have normal ambulation and huddling, as well as maintained regular grooming behaviors 
(data not shown), which is in contrast to diminished grooming observed in stressed rats [38].
To address the possibility of the antinociception being the result of anxiety due to 
overstimulation of the visual system, we performed elevated plus maze (EPM) experiments. 
A cohort of rats exposed to GLED for eight hours daily for five days developed 
antinociception as before (Fig. 7B), showed no signs of stress/anxiety as there were no 
differences in closed or open arm entries or in the anxiety index (Fig. 7C, D); the index 
combines EPM parameters into one unified ratio with values ranging from 0 to 1, with a 
higher value indicating increased anxiety [34]. In fact, rats exposed to GLED spent a 
significantly higher amount of time in the open arms than rats exposed to ambient room light 
(Fig. 7E), suggesting that GLED exposure was anxiolytic. Collectively, these results show 
that GLED-induced antinociception is not due to an anxiety related response in these rats.
3.4. Exposure to GLED does not impair motor performance
If, following exposure to GLED, the rats had a reduced motor activity, then this could 
contribute to the antinociception. To test this possibility, we investigated if the GLED 
exposure affected motor performance using the rotarod assay. Following verification of 
antinociceptive behaviors induced by exposure to GLED for eight hours daily for five days 
exhibited antinociception, we observed no change in the ability of the rats to stay on a 
rotating rod (Fig. 8). Thus, repeated GLED exposure does not affect motor performance or 
sedation.
3.5. Proteomics reveals GLED effects in the dorsal root ganglion and spinal dorsal horn
We used an unbiased-proteomics approach to identify possible protein alterations, using 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), in tissues from ambient 
versus GLED exposed rats. Among 559 non-redundant protein identified in our DRG 
samples (Lumbar levels 4, 5 and 6 were pooled), 65 proteins were detected only in DRGs 
from GLED treated rats (Fig. 9A). Gene ontology (GO) terms corresponding to the 
biological processes (Fig. 9B), molecular functions (Fig. 9C), and cellular component (Fig. 
9D) of these proteins identified in DRGs were extracted and compared between ambient and 
GLED exposed rats. We noted a higher number of proteins associated with the “response to 
stimulus” category and a fewer proteins associated with “growth” category in DRGs from 
GLED exposed rats compared to DRGs from ambient room light exposed rats (Fig. 9B). The 
molecular functions associated with these proteins suggests a decreased “structural molecule 
activity” and an increased “antioxidant activity” in DRGs from rats with GLED-induced 
thermal analgesia compared to controls (Fig. 9C). Finally, fewer proteins from GLED DRGs 
appear to be localized in “organelle part” and “membrane” (Fig. 9D).
A total of 430 non-redundant proteins were identified in dorsal horn tissues, of which 43 
were found only in the samples from rats with GLED-induced thermal analgesia (Fig. 9E). 
We observed a higher number of proteins associated with “metabolic process” and “cellular

 process” categories in dorsal horn from GLED exposed rats compared to dorsal horn from 
ambient room light exposed rats (Fig. 9F). The molecular functions associated with these 
proteins suggests a decreased “transporter activity” and an increased “binding” functions in 
dorsal horn from rats with GLED-induced thermal analgesia compared to controls (Fig. 9G). 
Finally, more proteins were observed to be in “cytoskeleton” and “intracellular organelles” 
while fewer proteins noted in “membrane”, “plasma membrane” and “organelle membrane” 
in dorsal horn from GLED exposed rats compared to dorsal horn from ambient room light 
exposed rats (Fig. 9H). Thus, fewer proteins are localized in membranes in dorsal horn, 
which is correlated, with fewer proteins implicated in localization processes in DRGs.
3.6. Analgesic effects of GLED exposure in neuropathic pain
Having determined that GLED is antinociceptive in naïve animals, we next asked if this non-
pharmacological paradigm could be effective in reversing allodynia and hyperalgesia 
associated with the SNL model of experimental neuropathic pain. Probing the plantar 
surface of the hindpaw ipsilateral to the side of nerve injury in SNL rats, 7 days post injury, 
revealed thermal hyperalgesia (Fig. 10A) and tactile allodynia (Fig. 10B). Exposing SNL-
injured rats for eight hours daily to 4 lux GLED levels resulted in complete reversal of 
thermal hyperalgesia; the latencies were significantly higher than baseline so as to be 
antinociceptive (Fig. 10A). Paw withdrawal thresholds were also maximally reversed by a 3 
day exposure to GLED (Fig. 10B). To address the duration of the GLED effect in SNL rats, 
we terminated GLED exposure and continued to measure anti-hyperalgesic and 
antiallodynic behaviors. After termination of GLED, it took ten days for the thermal 
latencies (Fig. 10C) and four days for mechanical thresholds to return to post-surgical values 
(Fig. 10D).
Using qRT-PCR, we determined expression levels of mRNAs for various endogenous 
opioids in spinal cords of naïve rats as well as rats with SNL or sham in the presence of 
GLED exposure. Expression of the following genes was measured: (i) Prepronociceptin 
(PNOC) coding for Nocistatin, Nociceptin, and Orphanin FQ2 [17]; (ii) Pro-
opiomelanocortin (POMC) coding for NPP, Melanotropin gamma, corticotropin, 
melanotropin alpha, Lipotropin beta, Lipotropin gamma, Melanotropin beta, Beta-endorphin 
and Met-enkephalin [11]; (iii) Proenkephalin-A (PENK) coding for Synenkephalin, Met-
enkephalin (4 copies), Met-enkephalin-Arg-Gly-Leu, Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe and Leu-
enkephalin [18]; (iv) Proenkephalin-B (PDYN) coding for Alpha-neoendorphin, Beta-
neoendorphin, and Leu-enkephalin (3 copies), Big dynorphin, Dynorphin A(1–17), 
Dynorphin A(1–13), Dynorphin A(1–8), Leumorphin and Rimorphin [17]; and (v) Mu-type 
opioid receptor (OPRM1) coding for preproniceptin and Pro-opiomelanocortin [60]. These 
analyses demonstrate that expression of PENK gene, but not others, is significantly 
increased after GLED exposure (Fig. 10E), suggesting that the increased enkephalin levels 
in the spinal cord of green LED exposed rats could be one contributing factor for their 
analgesia.

 4. Discussion
We characterized the antinociceptive and anti-hyperalgesic effects of GLED phototherapy. In 
naïve rats, the antinociceptive effect of GLED involves (1) visual system, (2) mu-opioid 
receptor pathways and descending pain inhibitory pathways from the RVM, (3) increased 
spinal cord expression of enkephalins, and (4) alterations in spinal cord and nociceptor 
proteomes. We were unable to link GLED-mediated antinociception to stress/anxiety. We 
demonstrate GLED phototherapy’s ability to reverse reduced sensory thresholds in a model 
of neuropathic pain, supporting its use as a possible novel, non-pharmacological approach in 
managing chronic pain.
A key issue in interpreting photically-induced antinociception is delineating the route of 
entry of light and its possible relationship to pain modulatory circuits. Here, whole body 
illumination with GLED for eight hours resulted in antinociception. In contrast, previous 
studies reported reversal of pain in mice following 30–150 seconds of infrared LED 
exposure directly touching the skin [15; 16]. The differences in exposure times (seconds 
versus hours) and “routes of administration” with either direct skin exposure or whole body 
illumination could result in engagement of different mechanisms. Additionally, lower 
intensity GLED was more antinociceptive. These results are consistent with a recent study 
[62], which reported that low intensity green light reduced the intensity of migraines by 
~15% compared to lights of other colors and higher intensities.
Blocking GLED access to the eyes prevented antinociception, arguing for an important role 
by the visual system in the development of antinociception. Our data point to a role for the 
visual system in the antinociceptive and antiallodynic effects of GLED. However, exactly 
how this occurs is unknown. Electrical stimulation of the optic nerves in rats has been 
reported to increase blood pressure and heart rate, and to decrease baroreceptor mediated 
vagal bradycardia. This effect was largely attenuated by inactivation of the periaqueductal 
grey (PAG), an anatomical region known to modulate pain [33; 53], suggesting mechanistic 
neural links between the optic nerve and the PAG [13]. Light sensitive melanopsin-
containing ganglion cells in the eyes [68] project directly to the circadian rhythm controlling 
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) [31; 80] and PAG [30]; these structures are connected [41]. 
Importantly, the SCN has been linked to pain as inferred from disruption of the circadian 
rhythm of thermoregulation in models of chronic inflammatory pain in rats [75] and 
increased c-Fos levels in rat with cystitis pain [6]. Finally, a retrograde labeling of the PAG 
demonstrated glutamate-like immunoreactivity in several regions of the brain including the 
occipital cortices [4], further supporting a link between the visual system and pain response. 
Martenson and colleagues [51] have recently identified a possible circuitry for photic 
stimulation that included pain modulating “ON-cells” and “OFF-cells” in the RVM which 
project to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where they are postulated to modulate 
somatosensory processing. An imbalance of these may lead to enhanced or diminished pain 
with ON-cells facilitating nociception and OFF-cells inhibiting nociception. Our studies 
support a role for the RVM as its chemical inactivation prevented GLED-induced 
antinociception.

 We demonstrated GLED-induced antinociception involves opioid receptors. However, 
whether this occurs via a peripheral or central mechanism of action is at present unknown. 
Suppression of GLED-induced antinociception with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, 
administered systemically, may support a role of peripheral opioid receptors, which is 
consistent with previous reports demonstrating that administration of naloxone prevents 
infrared spectrum therapy induced antinociception in models of post-operative [16] or 
inflammatory pain [52]. However, the ability of naloxone given intrathecally to reverse the 
antinociception effect argues in favor of a central site of action for the GLED since this dose 
and volume would not be expected to have a significant effect if the site of action was in the 
periphery. It is conceivable that GLED may have both central and peripheral effects. Future 
studies will explore these possibilities.
While overstimulation of the visual system could cause stress-induced antinociception, our 
data suggest GLED-induced antinociception is not linked to stress/anxiety for several 
reasons. First, pharmacological antagonism of receptors implicated in stress did not affect 
antinociception. Second, behavioral studies did not link GLED-induced antinociception to 
anxiety in the elevated plus maze experiments. Finally, grooming behaviors of rats with 
GLED exposures were unaffected implying no link to stress. Future studies will assess 
neurochemical correlates of stress (e.g., glucocorticoids) in GLED antinociception.
Sensory neuronal adaptations, due to possible changes in activities of voltage-gated calcium 
and/or sodium channels, may help explain the molecular mechanisms underlying GLED-
induced antinociception. N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) are key for 
antinociception [73]. The overall functional competence of neurons for calcium influx, as 
assessed by their ability to respond to agonists of various receptors using a high-throughput 
calcium imaging platform [55], was not different between sensory neurons from rats 
exposed to ambient light or GLED (Supplementary Figure 1). However, we observed a 
decrease in depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx via CaV2.2 in sensory neurons from GLED 
exposed rats (Supplementary Figure 1E). No changes were observed in sodium channels 
(Supplementary Figure 2) ruling out their involvement in neuronal adaptations and GLED-
induced analgesia. It is possible that the prolonged antinociceptive effect of GLED may, in 
part, be attributed to long-term changes in CaV2.2 or other calcium channel subtypes. 
Further studies will investigate the role of calcium and other channels in mediating the long-
lasting effect of GLED.
Unbiased proteomics identified a protein signature in dorsal root ganglia and dorsal horn of 
GLED-exposed antinociceptive rats. Stratification of proteins based on gene ontology (GO) 
terms corresponding to biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components 
revealed an enrichment of proteins related to “antioxidant activity” in ganglia of GLED-
exposed rats, a finding consistent with reported reduction in antioxidant activities (e.g., 
catalase and superoxide dismutase) in rats with inflammatory pain [52]. Additionally, low-
level light therapy reduces levels of inflammatory mediators (e.g., interleukins 6 and 8) 
associated with intervertebral disc degeneration, a key cause of low back pain [35]. We 
noted a reduction in the number of membrane-localized proteins in dorsal horn of GLED-
exposed rats, which likely correlates with decreased signaling capabilities of neurons. Our 
findings uncovered proteins enriched in tissues from GLED exposed rats that are reportedly

 linked to antinociception (Table 3). For example, purine nucleoside phosphorylase breaks 
down adenosine into inosine, which has antinociceptive properties via actions on the 
Adenosine A1 receptor [57] and via pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein coupled receptors 
and the subsequent inactivation of calcium channels [49]. Aspartyl aminopeptidase, which 
converts angiotensin II to angiotensin III, is reported to activate inhibitory pain descending 
pathways from the PAG [65]. Our findings of chemical inactivation of the RVM further 
support a role of inhibitory pain descending pathways in GLED mediated antinociception. 
Another example is lactoylglutathione lyase (i.e., glyoxalase-1), which catalyzes the 
detoxification of methylglyoxal, a cytotoxic ketoaldehyde, which is directly linked to 
activating nociceptors [1]. Moreover, expression of glyoxalase-1 is reduced in diabetic 
neuropathy [37]. These lines of evidence, along with those listed in Table 3, build a picture 
consistent with global changes induced by GLED to produce antinociception.
We used a model of neuropathic pain to illustrate the possible use of GLED as a non-
pharmacological treatment. Spinal nerve ligation (SNL) is a commonly used model of 
neuropathic pain in rats [40]. Common neuropathic pain medications reverse 
hypersensitivity associated with neuropathic conditions, but do not usually produce 
antinociception. For example, gabapentin blocks the N-type calcium channel [47] to reverse 
tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in diabetic neuropathy, however, it failed to 
produce antinociception [69]. Carbamazepine, an antiepileptic medication used for 
neuropathic pain, blocks sodium channels to reverse thermal hyperalgesia in tail flick test in 
a model of cis-platin induced hyperalgesia, but fails to produce antinociception [54]. In 
contrast, GLED reversed tactile and thermal hypersensitivity associated with SNL and 
produced long-lasting antinociception. We observed that GLED decreased calcium influx 
via the N-type calcium channel (supplementary Figure 1F), which may account for both the 
anti-allodynic and -hyperalgesic effects; however, the exact mechanisms contributing to the 
long-lasting nature of the effect is presently unknown. We also observed that GLED 
activates opioid receptors, which may account for antiallodynia, antihyperalgesia and 
antinociception. The complete reversal of the effects of GLED using naloxone also argues 
for a key role for opioid receptors in producing antiallodynia, antihyperalgesia and 
antinociception. It is conceivable that multiple mechanisms of actions may act 
synergistically to produce the effects seen with GLED. In contrast to the side-effects 
observed with opioids, an advantage of the GLED approach is lack of side effects such as 
development of tolerance, sedation, respiratory depression, and motor coordination. Equally 
important was the lack of hyperalgesia following prolonged GLED exposure. The lack of 
these side effects suggests that using GLED may be a safe treatment for neuropathic, and 
other pain states, and may also complement the use of pain medications.
Our findings identify cellular and molecular basis of GLED–mediated antinociception. From 
a translational perspective, the discovery that GLED exposure is antinociceptive and 
antiallodynic, opens up routes for the development of a non-invasive therapeutic approach 
for pain. Consequently, modulating the duration and intensity of GLED may prove useful 
clinically for reducing opioid for pain management. Additionally, the long-lasting and non-
tolerance inducing effects of GLED may improve patient compliance.

 Figure 1. Effect of light emitting diode (LED) exposure on thermal analgesia in naïve rats
Following measurement of baseline (BL) paw withdrawal latency (PWL, seconds), rats were 
randomly assigned (n=6 per group) to exposures of eight hours daily for five days to: dark; 
ambient room light; or white, green (λ=525 nm) or blue (λ=472 nm) LED. At the end of 
this exposure paradigm, PWLs were again measured. Blue and GLED exposure resulted in 
thermal analgesia. *p<0.05 when comparing to white LED (one-way ANOVA followed by 
Student-Newman-Keuls test) and #p<0.05 when comparing between green and blue LED 
exposures (non-parametric Student’s t-test). Unless otherwise stated, the data represent mean 
± SEM for all figures in this manuscript.

rats were subjected to the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. (C) GLED exposure did not 
change the number of times the rats entered the open or closed arms in the EPM. (D) The 
anxiety index, an integrated measure of times and entries into the arms of the EPM, was not 
different between rats at baseline and after exposure to the GLED paradigm. (E) The GLED
