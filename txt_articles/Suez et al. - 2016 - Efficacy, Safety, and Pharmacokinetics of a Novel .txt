Abstract Patients with primary immunodeficiency disease
(PIDD) typically require life-long intravenous (IV) or subcu-
taneous (SC) immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy to
prevent recurrent infections. The efficacy, safety, and pharma-
cokinetics of a highly concentrated (20 %) Ig preparation for
SC administration (IGSC 20 %) were evaluated in a prospec-
tive trial in patients with PIDD. A total of 74 patients (aged 3–
83 years) received 4327 IGSC 20 % infusions over a median
of 380.5 days. The rate of validated serious bacterial infections
was 0.012 event/patient-year (p < 0.0001 compared with the
historical control), and the annualized rate of infection was
2.41 events/patient. Median IgG trough levels were >14.5 g/
l. The median maximum infusion rate was 60 ml/h/site (range
4.4–180), resulting in a median infusion duration of 0.95 h. A
volume ≥30 ml was infused per site in 74.8 % of IGSC 20 %
infusions. Most (84.9 %) infusions were administered using
≤2 infusion sites; for 99.8 % of infusions, there was no need to
interrupt/stop administration or reduce the infusion rate. No
related serious adverse event (AE) occurred during IGSC
20 % treatment; related non-serious AEs occurred at a rate
of 0.036 event/infusion. The incidence of related local AEs
was 0.015 event/infusion and of related systemic AEs was
0.021 event/infusion; most were mild in severity, none severe.
Increased infusion rates or volumes were not associated with
higher AE rates. The investigated IGSC 20 % treatment was
shown to be effective and safe, enabling higher infusion rates
and volumes per site compared to conventional SC treatments,
resulting in fewer infusion sites and shorter infusion durations.

Introduction
Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD) result from ge-
netic defects in the immune system, more than 300 of which
have been identified [1]. Patients with PIDD are susceptible to
bacterial, viral, and fungal infections [2]. In about 53 % of
these patients, the diagnosis of PIDD is associated with defec-
tive antibody production with or without decreased levels of
serum immunoglobulin (Ig) (e.g., common variable immuno-
deficiency, specific antibody deficiency, X-linked or

drome) [3].
Polyclonal IgG preparations purified from human plasma
have been used as antibody replacement therapy to reduce the
number and severity of infections in patients with PIDD since
the early 1950s [4, 5]. Due to their diverse specificity, poly-
clonal IgGs are able to neutralize infectious agents, enhance
phagocytosis, and modulate the immune response. For clinical
effectiveness in PIDD, antibody replacement therapy general-
ly requires a monthly dose in the range of 0.3 to 0.6 g/kg body
weight (BW) administered intravenously (IV) or subcutane-
ously (SC) [6]. With IgG solutions at 5 or 10 % weight per
volume (w/v) protein concentration, volumes of 3 to 6 ml/kg
BW are routinely administered IV [7].
IgG replacement therapy administered SC (IGSC) has been
widely established in recent years. It is safe and well-tolerated
with a particularly low risk of systemic adverse reactions com-
pared to IVadministration of IgG [5, 7]. IGSC slowly diffuses
from the SC space into the systemic circulation while equili-
brating with the extravascular compartment. Consequently,
there is no high peak in the IgG concentration as seen follow-
ing IV infusion, and sustained steady-state IgG levels can be
achieved. At the same monthly equivalent dose as IV immu-
noglobulin replacement therapy (IGIV), IGSC may lead to
higher serum IgG trough levels compared to IV infusion [8,
9]. With appropriate training by healthcare professionals, SC
infusions of immunoglobulin can easily be performed by pa-
tients at home without assistance, thus increasing their com-
fort and independence and also reducing cost [10].
A drawback of IGSC compared to IVinfusion is the limited
volume that can be administered into each site due to resis-
tance of the SC extracellular matrix. Consequently, the rate at
which IGSC can be infused is slower compared to IGIV,
resulting in longer infusion times and requiring multiple infu-
sion sites per treatment, usually on a weekly basis. One of the
strategies to overcome these limitations is the development of
highly concentrated IgG formulations that allow for infusion
of the same dose in smaller infusion volumes compared to less
concentrated products [5].
Alternatively, SC immunoglobulin product that could be
infused at higher rates and volumes per site would provide
an advantage over currently available conventional SC prep-
arations by decreasing infusion duration and the number of
infusion sites. Immune globulin subcutaneous (human) (IGSC
20 %, Baxalta, now part of Shire) is a ready-for-use, sterile
liquid preparation of highly purified, concentrated, function-
ally intact human IgG developed specifically for SC adminis-
tration to provide patients with an additional treatment option.
Presented here are the results of a prospective phase 2/3
study that evaluated the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and phar-
macokinetic (PK) characteristics of a new IGSC 20 % treat-
ment option in adult and pediatric patients with PIDD in North
America.
Methods
Study Design
This prospective, open-label clinical trial (registered on
clinicaltrials.gov: NCT no. 01218438) was conducted in ac-
cordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the internation-
al standards of Good Clinical Practice. Patients were enrolled
at 15 sites in the USA and Canada; informed consent was
obtained from each patient prior to undergoing any study
procedures.
The trial comprised four study periods: in period 1, patients
received IGIV 10 % and in periods 2 to 4, they received IGSC
20 % (Supplementary material Figure S1). Period 1 was de-
signed mainly to determine the area under the IgG concentra-
tion curve (AUC) following IV administration (AUCIV).
During IGSC 20 % treatment, systemic exposure equivalent
to previous IGIV 10 % treatment (as measured by the AUC of
total IgG over time) was targeted. Therefore, IGSC 20 %
doses were adjusted to compensate for the lower bioavailabil-
ity of IgG-administered SC. The adjustment factor to calculate
the IGSC 20 % dose in period 2 (145 %) was approximated
from the PK data of available IGSC products [11, 12]. Next,
based on the PK data collected from the first 18 patients treat-
ed with IGSC 20 % at 145 % of the IGIV 10 % dose in period
2, the IGSC 20 % dose that would (on average) provide equiv-
alent IgG exposure as IGIV 10 % administration (Badjusted
IGSC 20 % dose^) was determined to be 145 % of the IGIV
10 % dose. In period 3, patients were treated with IGSC 20 %
at the Badjusted dose.^ Since this adjusted dose represented
the average dose-response of only 18 patients, the possibility
of over- or under-dosing could not be excluded. Thus, for each
patient, an individually adapted (individualized) dose of IGSC
20 % was determined by comparing the patient trough level
(equivalent to the steady-state serum IgG level) attained in
period 3 to the expected trough level increase calculated from
the PK data of periods 1 and 2. During period 4, the patients
were infused with IGSC 20 % at this dose for 40 weeks.
Study Population
Patients aged 2 years and older diagnosed with PIDD involv-
ing defective antibody production and requiring IgG replace-
ment as defined by the International Union of Immunological
Societies (IUIS) Scientific Committee 2011 [13] and by diag-
nostic criteria according to Conley et al. [14] were eligible for
enrollment in the study. Inclusion criteria also required that
patients had received a stable dose (IVor SC) of IgG equiva-
lent to at least 0.3 g/kg BW/4 weeks and not higher than 1 g/kg
BW/4 weeks for a minimum of 12 weeks prior to first treat-
ment and had serum IgG trough levels >5 g/l at screening.
Patients were excluded from the study if they had a history
of hepatitis B or C or a positive human immunodeficiency

 virus test; if they had persistent abnormal alanine aminotrans-
ferase and aspartate aminotransferase values >2.5 times the
upper limit of normal for the testing laboratory, creatinine
clearance value <60 % of normal according to their age and
gender, or severe neutropenia or protein loss at screening; or if
they had been diagnosed with a malignancy, were receiving
anticoagulation therapy, or had a history of thrombotic epi-
sodes. Patients were also excluded if they were receiving an-
tibiotics, had an active infection at the time of screening, or
had had an acute serious bacterial infection within 3 months
prior to screening. A complete list of eligibility criteria is
available in the Supplementary material.
Study Product
IGSC 20 % is a liquid concentrate of functionally intact,
aggregate-free IgG derived from human plasma. The produc-
tion of IGSC 20 % follows the same manufacturing processes
as IGI, 10 % solution (marketed under the Baxalta, now part
of Shire trade-name GAMMAGARD LIQUID® in the US
and Kiovig® in the EU) except for ultra/diafiltration and final
formulation at 20 % (w/v) protein concentration. The
manufacturing process of IGSC 20 % includes three dedicated
virus inactivation and reduction steps: solvent/detergent (S/D)
treatment [15], nanofiltration (35 nm) [15, 16], and low pH
incubation with elevated temperature [17, 18]. Similar to IGI,
10 %, IGSC 20 % contains glycine as stabilizer to minimize
IgG dimerization. The final IGSC 20 % product has a viscos-
ity of 14.4 mPa/s, an osmolality of 280–292 mOsm/kg and
contains trace amounts of IgA (average concentration 80 μg/
ml). Each lot of IGSC 20 % is monitored for procoagulant
activity using a thrombin generation assay to ensure that the
final container is free of procoagulants.
Immunoglobulin Treatments
Patients received IGIV 10 % at the monthly equivalent dose
used prior to entering the study (required dose range 0.3-
1.0 g/kg BW/4 weeks) every 3 or 4 weeks at the clinical
site. IGSC 20 % was administered once a week; doses used
in the respective study periods are described in the BStudy
design^ section. IGSC 20 % was infused using an electro-
mechanical syringe-driver pump (CME T34L, Caesarea
Medical Electronics) and high-flow, 24-gauge low-resistance
needles (RMS Medical Products). The needle sets used in
the trial ranged from 6 to 12 mm in length at the discretion
of the investigator; there was no specified needle length for
infusion. Infusion rates were increased incrementally: the
initial two infusions were to be started at 10 ml/h/infusion
site and could be increased to a maximum of 20 ml/h/infu-
sion site. Subsequent infusions could begin at the maximum
tolerated infusion rate for the initial infusions, and as toler-
ated, the infusion rate was to be increased to a maximum of
60 ml/h/site. For patients with a body weight of 40 kg or
above, an infusion volume of up to 60 ml was to be admin-
istered per infusion site if well tolerated. For patients with a
body weight below 40 kg, it was recommended to limit
infusion volume to 20 ml per site for the initial two infu-
sions. Volumes could then be increased to a maximum of
60 ml per site as tolerated. Multiple infusion sites could be
used simultaneously. Infusion sites were to be rotated to
avoid any single infusion site being used repeatedly within
a short time interval. Infusion of IGSC 20 % at home was
possible after sufficient training of the patient/caregiver or
with assistance of a healthcare professional.
Efficacy Assessment
Efficacy was evaluated based on the analysis of serious acute
bacterial infections, all infections, and IgG levels. Serious
bacterial infections, such as bacteremia/sepsis, bacterial men-
ingitis, osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, bacterial pneumonia, and
visceral abscesses caused by a recognized bacterial pathogen
were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic Criteria for
Serious Infection Types in the FDA Guidance for Industry,
June 2008 [19]. The primary efficacy assessment was the an-
nualized rate of validated acute serious bacterial infections
(VASBIs, defined as RVASBI = mean number of VASBI/pa-
tient/year). Efficacy was also evaluated by the annualized rate
of all infections (i.e., VASBIs and all other events clinically
assessed as infections), as well as the number of fever episodes
(body temperature ≥ 38 °C), the number of days with fever,
the number of days missed from school/work or to perform
normal daily activities due to illness/infection, the number of
admissions to a hospital as an in-patient, and the number of
days as a stationary patient in the hospital, as well as urgent or
unscheduled physician visits due to illness/infection (apart
from the regular investigator/study site visits scheduled every
8–12 weeks within the study).
Safety
Safety was evaluated through clinical and laboratory assess-
ments. Safety data were collected throughout the study. The
AEs that occurred during the infusions at the site (every 8–
12 weeks) were recorded by the investigator. All investigators
were specifically trained on symptoms of potential AEs. All
patients received an eDiary tablet to continuously record home
treatments, AEs, and additional information as they occurred.
The investigator provided guidance for the patient/caregiver
regarding identification and documentation of local and sys-
temic AEs, including signs of hemolysis such as fever, chills,
back pain, fatigue, and dark urine. All patients were instructed
to inform the investigator/site immediately in case of such an
event. In addition, the patient was contacted by the investiga-
tor within 3–5 days after each infusion, either at the study site
702
J Clin Immunol (2016) 36:700–712
 or at their home for follow-up to ensure appropriate documen-
tation of AEs. The investigators reviewed patients’ eDiary
entries at every site visit. All AEs were assessed by the inves-
tigator using comprehensive data collection systems—includ-
ing the patient’s eDiary—for seriousness, severity, temporal
association, and possible causal relatedness to the investiga-
tional product.
Monitoring for potential cases of hemolysis comprised rou-
tine hematology screening and hemolysis screening as recom-
mended by the FDA Guidance for Industry (June 2008 [19]).
If a decrease of hemoglobin ≥2 g/dl was measured during
either the hematology or hemolysis screening, the assessments
to monitor for potential cases of hemolysis were to be per-
formed within 48–72 h of being informed of the hemoglobin
level, unless there was a clear alternative explanation. These
assessments included direct antiglobin (Coomb’s) test,
plasma-free hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, lactate dehydro-
genase (LDH), serum haptoglobin, and urine hemosiderin.
Pharmacokinetics
Determination of total serum IgG concentration was per-
formed at a central laboratory using a validated enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based method. PK as-
sessments were performed over a specific dosing interval: in
period 1 between infusions 10 and 11, for patients aged
12 years and older; in period 2 between infusions 9 and 10,
for the first 18 patients aged 12 years and older; and for all
patients in period 4 between infusions 17 and 18
(Supplementary material Figure S1). In period 2 and 4, sam-
ples were collected preinfusion and on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after
IGSC 20 % administration in patients aged 12 years and older.
In patients aged 2–11 years, samples to determine the AUC
over a dosing interval (AUC0−τ) after IGSC 20 % administra-
tion were only drawn preinfusion and on days 3 and 7 in order
to limit the number of blood draws.
Total serum IgG trough levels were assessed immediately
prior to each IGIV 10 % infusion in period 1 and during IGSC
20 % treatment: prior to infusion 1, twice each in periods 2 and
3, four times during period 4, and at the end-of-study visit.
Statistical Methods
Efficacy was assessed by the mean number of VASBIs per
patient per year (RVASBI). Assuming RVASBI = 0.6 and a one-
sided test and a Type I error = 0.01, a sample size of 59 pa-
tients would have in excess of 85 % power to test the null
hypothesis that RVASBI ≥1.0 against the alternative hypothesis
RVASBI <1.0. RVASBI and 99 % upper confidence limit (CI)
were calculated using a Poisson model accounting for the
length of the observation periods per patient.
The AUC between adjacent infusions was calculated by the
trapezoidal rule. To allow for comparisons between periods 1,
2, and 4, AUC0−τ was standardized for the infusion intervals
(3 or 4 weeks vs. 1 week = AUC0−τ;h;). The bioavailability of
IGSC 20 % relative to IGIV 10 % was estimated from the ratio
of AUC0−τ;h in period 4 (SC treatment at an individualized
dose, once per week) over AUC0−τ;h in period 1 (IV treatment
every 3 or 4 weeks) standardized to 1 week.
Measures of Patient Experience
Treatment burden related to Ig therapy was evaluated with the
Life Quality Index questionnaire (LQI) for the age group 2 to
12 years (observer: parent) and the age group 13 years and
older (observer: patient) [20, 21]. The LQI covers four do-
mains: treatment interference, therapy-related problems, ther-
apy settings, and treatment costs. While data related to treat-
ment cost LQI domain were collected, they were not included
in the analysis as patients received free treatment during the
study. Treatment satisfaction was surveyed in age groups from
2 to 12 years (observer: parent) and 13 years and older (ob-
server: patient) using the Treatment Satisfaction
Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) [22]. Evaluations
were performed at baseline, at the end of periods 1 and 3
and during the end-of-study visit (or early termination visit).
Score changes between end of period 1 and end of period 3 or
end of study visit were analyzed. In both the LQI and TSQM-
9, higher scores indicated higher satisfaction.
Results
Study Population
Seventy-seven (77) patients with PIDD started study period 1
(51.9 % males, 48.1 % females; age range 3–83 years;
Supplementary material Table S1). More than half of the pa-
tients had either common variable immunodeficiency (33.7 %),
Bspecific antibody deficiency^ (23.4 %), or agammaglobulin-
emia (14.3 %, congenital and autosomal recessive combined;
Supplementary material Table S2). All patients had received
antibody replacement therapy until just prior to study entry
(68.8 % IV; 31.2 % SC). None of the patients screened for
inclusion in the study had elevated transaminases, and therefore,
no patient was excluded based on these criteria. Overall, 74
patients were administered IGSC 20 % and 67 (90.5 %) patients
completed the study (Supplementary material Figure S2). Two
patients were discontinued from the study during period 1 for
non-adherence, and one patient withdrew from the study after
being hospitalized for mild headache (SAE) assessed as related
to IGIV 10 % infusion. During IGSC 20 % treatment, seven
patients prematurely discontinued treatment. One patient who
had common variable immune deficiency and fibromyalgia ex-
perienced fatigue (unrelated to IGSC 20 % administration) and
chose to discontinue. One patient was terminated from the study
J Clin Immunol (2016) 36:700–712
703
 because of poor adherence to the study protocol and five pa-
tients withdrew consent for reasons unrelated to AEs
(Supplementary material Figure S2).
Efficacy
During IGSC 20 % treatment, the point estimate of RVASBI
was statistically significantly lower than 1 (RVASBI = 0.01;
99 % CI = 0.024; p < 0.0001; Table 1). One VASBI of pneu-
monia treated with systemic antibiotics developed during pe-
riod 4 in a 78-year-old patient who had specific antibody de-
ficiency and a history of allergic bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis.
The point estimate of the annualized rate of all infections
was 2.41 events/patient during IGSC 20 % treatment and 3.86
events/patient during IGIV 10 % administration (Table 1).
While receiving IGSC 20 %, the annualized rate of days off
of school/work was 1.16 days, and hospitalizations occurred
at a rate of less than once per year for ≤1 day/year (all point
estimates). Overall, 58/74 (78.4 %) patients received antibi-
otics mostly for treatment of acute infections during IGSC
20 % for an annualized duration of 57.59 days (point esti-
mate). The point estimate of the rate of acute (urgent or un-
scheduled) physician visits due to infection or other illness
was also less than one visit per year (Table 1).
Safety
IGSC 20 % was safe, with no serious causal-related AEs. Of
the three serious AEs that occurred during the trial, one was a
mild headache assessed as related to IGIV 10 % by the inves-
tigator for which the patient was hospitalized and kept under
observation and subsequently withdrew from the study. The
other two SAEs, a severe lung adenocarcinoma and a moder-
ate pneumonia, the VASBI described above, were not deemed
related to IGSC 20 % treatment.
The incidence of non-serious AEs per infusion was 0.108
event/infusion during IGSC 20 % treatment and was 0.556
event/infusion during IGIV 10 % administration (Table 2).
Of the 466 non-serious AEs (other than infections) reported
for IGSC 20 %, 157 non-serious AEs (0.036 event/infusion)
were deemed causally related to IGSC 20 %; most (136/157;
86.6 %) were of mild severity; none were severe.
Systemic AEs assessed as causally related to IGSC 20 %
treatment were reported in 25.7 % of patients with an inci-
dence of 0.021 event/infusion. The most frequent systemic
AEs considered related to IGSC 20 % infusions were head-
ache (0.011 event/infusion) followed by fatigue and nausea
(0.002 event/infusion each; Table 3). Headache was experi-
enced by 10.8 % of patients receiving IGSC 20 % infusion.
Diarrhea was reported by 2.7 % of patients, however with an
incidence of less than 0.001 per infusion. The other systemic
AEs deemed related to IGSC 20 % were reported at a very low
frequency (≤0.001 event/ infusion, Table 3). There was no
event of laboratory-confirmed hemolysis following IGSC
20 % administration. A decline in hemoglobin of 2.0 g/dl or
more was observed in six patients (during IGIV 10 % treat-
ment (n = 1), during IGSC 20 % administration (n = 3), and at
the Bend-of-study^ visit (n = 2)). However, at no time was
there a concordance of other laboratory test results (e.g.,

tients. No renal AEs or changes in laboratory values that mea-
sure kidney function were reported during the study.
Causally related local AEs occurred at a frequency of 0.015
event/infusion during IGSC 20 % treatment (Table 2); only
58/4327 (1.3 %) IGSC 20 % infusions were associated with
one or more related local AEs. Over the entire course of the
study, 24.3 % of patients reported experiencing one or more
local AEs related to IGSC 20 % infusion at some time during
the study (Table 2). However, the proportion of patients
reporting one or more related local AE and the incidence of
related local AEs per patient per year decreased throughout
the study. At infusion 1, 13 % of the patients reported one or
more related local AE; by infusion 6, this proportion dropped
to below 5 % of the patients and continued to decrease to
around 2 % or below and remained at this level until the end
of the study (Supplementary material Figure S3A). In addi-
tion, the annualized rate of related local AEs was highest in the
first 4 weeks of IGSC 20 % treatment and decreased progres-
sively thereafter to values below 1 after 16 weeks of treatment
(Supplementary material Figure S3B).
IGSC 20 % Administration Characteristics
IGSC 20 % was administered to 74 patients for a median
treatment duration of 380.5 days (range 30–629). At least
one IGSC 20 % infusion was performed at home in 95.9 %
of the patients, with or without professional assistance.
Patients received a total of 4327 infusions of IGSC 20 %
during the study, 79.1 % (3421/4327) of which were admin-
istered at home. Of note, certain visits had to be performed
at the study site; therefore, even patients who had
transitioned to home care were required per protocol to

 receive some infusions on site. The mean (±SD) weekly
dose of IGSC 20 % was 0.222 ± 0.071 g/kg/week. Across
all age groups, a median infusion volume per site of
39.50 ml (range 6.4–76.0) was administered (Table 4). For
74.8 % (3228/ 4314) of IGSC 20 % infusions, a volume
≥30 ml was infused per site. A volume of 60 ml and above
per site was administered to 10.8 % of patients at least once
(Fig. 1a) and in 7.4 % (320/4314) of IGSC 20 % infusions
(Fig. 2a). Infusions with a volume per site < 60 ml usually
had either a total required dose per infusion of <60 ml (one
site) or a total volume of >60 ml and <120 ml and therefore
were divided into two sites.
The median maximum rate of infusion was 60 ml/h/site
(range 4.4–180) resulting in a median infusion duration of
0.95 h (range 0.2–6.4; Table 4). Overall, 71.6 % of pa-
tients achieved a maximum infusion rate of 60 ml/h/ site
or more at least once (Fig. 1b) and 57.5 % (2480/4314) of
infusions were administered at this infusion rate (Fig. 2b).
A median number of 2.0 sites/infusion (range 1–4) were
used for administration; 84.9 % (3662/4314) of infusions
used two infusion sites or fewer.
Tolerability
The short-term tolerability of IGSC 20 % treatment was eval-
uated by recording infusions for which the infusion rate had to
be reduced, interrupted, or stopped due to tolerability concerns
or AEs. For 99.8 % of IGSC 20 % infusions, there was no
need to stop/interrupt administration or reduce the infusion
rate (Table 5). The infusion rate had to be reduced in five
(0.1 %) IGSC 20 % infusions administered to four patients,
two of whom were children (aged 10 and 13 years, respective-
ly). As a result of infusion leakage, two other pediatric patients
(aged 8 and 11 years) each had one infusion interrupted, and
one infusion was stopped in the 8-year old patient. IGSC 20 %
infusions associated with a causally related local AE were
categorized by volume and maximum infusion rate per site;
the incidence of causally related local AEs did not increase at
higher maximum infusion rates and infusion volumes (Fig. 2).
Therefore, overall, a very strong positive tolerability profile
for IGSC 20 % treatment was demonstrated with infusion
rates and volumes of up to 60 ml/h/site and 60 ml per site,
respectively.

 Pharmacokinetic Parameters
The pharmacokinetics of serum IgG during IGSC 20 %
treatment is depicted in Supplementary material
Figure S4. During weekly IGSC 20 % administration at
145 % of the IGIV 10 % dose and at the individualized
dose, no IgG peak was observed at day 1 postinfusion,
and mean serum IgG levels remained constant throughout
the treatment interval (Supplementary material Figure S4).
Pharmacokinetic parameters determined for IGSC 20 %
and IGIV 10 % are summarized in Table 6. The bioavail-
ability of IGSC 20 % following 1.45 dose conversion and
individual adjustment relative to IGIV 10 % was 1.09
(90 %CI 1.04 to 1.13, n = 49) as determined from the ratio
of the geometric means of the AUC while on IGSC 20 %
treatment once per week, compared to IGIV 10 % infusions
(standardized to one week).
Total Serum IgG Trough Levels
Throughout IGSC 20 % treatment, median serum IgG
trough values attained at the end of each treatment period
remained above 14.5 g/L (Table 7). After 17 consecutive
weeks of IGSC 20 % treatment at the individualized dose
once per week, the median serum IgG trough levels were
15.23 g/L (95 %CI 13.59–15.70; n = 64). The median se-
rum IgG trough levels recorded at the end of IGIV 10 %
treatment administered every 3 weeks was 12.0 g/l (95 %
CI 11.0–14.1 n = 19) and was 10.2 g/l (95 % CI 9.61–
11.3; n = 50) at the end of IGIV 10 % treatment given
every 4 weeks (Table 7).
Patient Experience
Changes in treatment satisfaction were assessed for all patients
when switching from IGIV 10 % in period 1 to IGSC 20 % in
period 3 (adjusted dose) and at the end of period 4 (individu-
alized dose).
Immunoglobulin-related treatment burden was evaluated
with the LQI questionnaire in three domains: treatment inter-
ference, therapy-related problems, and therapy settings. No
significant change in any of the domains was reported in pa-
tients aged 2–12 years. For patients 13 years and above, an
improvement in each of the domains was observed between
period 1 (IGIV 10 % administration) and the subsequent pe-
riods on IGSC 20 % treatment. Improvement in the treatment
interference domain was found to be statistically significant
(p = 0.008) across all age groups.
Assessment of treatment satisfaction using the TSQM-9
questionnaire found a significant improvement in the conve-
nience domain (p < 0.001) between period 1 (IGIV 10 % ad-
ministration) and period 4 (IGSC 20 % treatment). No signif-
icant improvement in the perception of effectiveness and glob-
al satisfaction was observed in either age group: 2–12 years
and 13 years and older.

 Discussion
Subcutaneous (SC) administration of human polyclonal im-
munoglobulin preparations has been shown to be efficacious
in preventing infection in patients with PIDD and is associated
with fewer systemic adverse reactions compared to the IV
route [5, 7, 23]. The improved systemic tolerability and
sustained protection from infections observed are likely due
to lower peak and higher trough levels of serum IgG admin-
istered SC [24]. Drawbacks, however, of SC compared to IV
administration with the current standard of 5 and 10 % IgG
preparations are that only small volumes can be infused and
multiple infusion sites are required per week for treatment [5,
7]. A highly concentrated IgG preparation such as the present
IGSC 20 % product may offer a new replacement therapy
option for patients with PIDD as relatively large volumes
per site could be infused at higher rates without impairing
tolerability, thereby reducing infusion duration and number
of infusion sites.
In this trial, a systemic exposure equivalent to the previous
IGIV 10 % treatment was targeted; thus, the IGSC 20 % dose
administered was adjusted to compensate for the lower bio-
availability of IgG when administered SC [12]. SC adminis-
tration of individually tailored IGSC 20% doses was effica-
cious in providing systemic exposure similar to that obtained
with IV infusions. Serum IgG levels above 5 g/l are generally
accepted as the minimal protective threshold although trough
levels of at least 7 g/l may be required to achieve adequate
protection against infections for some patients [25–27]. In the
present study, trough levels were substantially higher than this

 accepted protective threshold with a median serum IgG trough
level above 14 g/l throughout IGSC 20 % treatment. This may
have been due in part to the relatively high Ig doses that
patients had been receiving prior to study onset. Indeed, as
per study design, the patients received the same monthly
IgG dose/kg in period 1 as they did prior to study entry.
Therefore, the dose of IGIV 10 % was not predefined per
protocol but was determined by the treating physician and
the IGSC 20 % dose was subsequently adjusted to achieve
systemic exposure equivalent to the IGIV 10 % treatment
dose. Although high, the mean weekly dose of IGSC 20 %
dose in this study was within the range (0.177–0.224 g/kg BW
per week) reported for another IGSC 20 % product [11].
The high serum IgG trough levels maintained throughout
the study were efficacious in preventing VASBIs as demon-
strated by the low annualized rate of VASBIs per patient dur-
ing IGSC 20 % treatment. This rate of VASBIs was signifi-
cantly lower than the threshold specified by the FDA and
EMA guidelines as providing substantial evidence of efficacy
[19, 28, 29]. A further indicator of the protective effect of
IGSC 20 % was the annualized frequency of any infections
(2.41 events/patient), which was comparable to the incidence
of infections (2.76 events /patient) reported for another IGSC
20 % preparation [11] and lower than the annualized rate of
any infection episodes reported with other licensed IGSC
products: 3.946 events/patient in a 6-month study with IGSC
16 % [30] or 4.1 events/patient with an IGSC 10 % product
[12], although differences in study design and product con-
centrations may limit direct comparison. These efficacy re-
sults, together with the positive outcomes obtained for the
additional efficacy assessments (number and duration of fever
episodes and of hospitalizations as well as the low rate of days
missed from work, school, or daily activity), further support
the protective effect of IGSC 20 % as replacement therapy in
PIDD.
While the SC administration of IgG has been associated
with fewer systemic AEs than IGIV, a higher incidence of
local AEs has been reported [31]. The incidence of systemic
AEs related to IGSC 20 % infusions in the present study was
about 11-fold lower than for IGIV 10 % treatment. The rate
per infusion of local AEs deemed related to IGSC 20 % (0.015
event/infusion) was much lower than the rates reported with a
licensed equivalent IGSC 20 % preparation in studies con-
ducted in the USA (0.592 and 0.600 event/infusion, respec-
tively) [11, 32] and in Japan (0.274 event/infusion) [33] and
lower than the rates observed in an EU study (0.060 event/

 infusion) [34]. Consistent with these data, IGSC 20 % treat-
ment was well tolerated, with mostly mild (92.5 %) or mod-
erate (7.5 %), and no severe related local AEs reported. No
patients discontinued due to a local adverse reaction, and
98.7 % of IGSC 20 % infusions were not associated with
any local related non-serious AE. For 99.8 % of IGSC 20 %
infusions, no reduction of infusion rate was required; no infu-
sions had to be interrupted or stopped due to AE or tolerability
concerns, indicating an overall short-term tolerability at least
equivalent to that observed with a similar licensed IGSC 20 %
product [33]. The same model of electromechanical syringe-
driver pump was used in all patients to exclude potential dif-
ferences in tolerability and local adverse reactions that could
arise from different pump selections. Electromechanical
syringe-driver pumps were also used in US and EU studies
conducted with a licensed IGSC 20 % product [11, 34].
The favorable tolerability profile of IGSC 20 % infusions
permitted the administration of higher infusion rates and vol-
umes per site: the median maximum IGSC 20 % infusion rate
(60 ml/h/site; range 4.4–180) was above the maximum infu-
sion rate recommended for another IGSC 20 % preparation
(15–25 ml/h/site) [35]. This infusion rate was achieved in
more than half of completed IGSC 20 % infusions without
increase in the proportion of infusions associated with local
adverse reactions, indicating that the maximum recommended
infusion rate of 60 ml/h/site for this study was well-tolerated.
Of note, there was no predominance of any body mass index
in patients across all age groups; therefore, the possibility that
the favorable tolerability of higher rates and volumes was
related to the amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue is unlike-
ly. The similarity of IGSC 20 % osmolality (280–292 mOsm/
kg) with the physiological plasma osmolality (280–
296 mOsm/kg) could partly account for the positive tolerabil-
ity profile of IGSC 20 % [36, 37]. By comparison, the osmo-
lality of a licensed IGSC 20 % product is higher (380 mOsm/
kg) [38]. The use of glycine rather than proline as stabilizer in
the investigated IGSC 20 % product may also contribute to its
improved tolerability.
The high infusion rates enabled a lower infusion duration
(median 0.95 h, range 0.2–6.4 h) for IGSC 20 %, which is
markedly shorter than the duration reported for weekly infu-
sions of a licensed IGSC 20 % preparation (2 h; range 0.5–
17.0 h) [11]. In addition, infusion volumes of up to 60 ml/site
were administered in this study, resulting in one or two sites
per IGSC 20 % administration in over 75 % of infusions
compared to five or fewer sites in 75 % of infusions with a
licensed IGSC 10 % product [12]. The viscosity of IGSC 20 %
is similar to those of licensed IGSC 16 and 20 % preparations
(14.4 versus 14.4 mPa/s and 14.7 mPa/s, respectively). In
addition, there was no specified needle length for infusions.
Regardless, infusion characteristics determined for the study
product favored shorter infusion duration and fewer infusion
sites. Infusion sites were rotated to avoid any single infusion
site being used repeatedly within a short time interval.
Patients across all ages adhered to the SC administration of
treatment as evidenced by the overall high rate of study com-
pletion; 90 % of patients treated with IGSC 20 % completed
the study, including 95 % of patients aged 2 to <16 years old,
suggesting that IGSC 20 % did not place an unreasonable
burden on the daily activities of the adult and pediatric pa-
tients. Results of patient-reported outcome measures also
showed an overall positive evaluation of IGSC 20 % treat-
ment; in particular, a significant increase in treatment satisfac-
tion in terms of treatment convenience and interference was
observed. Home infusion was adopted by a high proportion
(96 %) of patients and may have contributed to the perception
of enhanced convenience. These results, in line with several
reports from other studies, show that the treatment experience
of patients with PIDD improves as a result of the practice of
subcutaneous administration (reviewed by Wasserman [5]).
In conclusion, IGSC 20 % administered SC at an individ-
ually adjusted dose was shown to have an excellent safety and
tolerability profile in patients with PIDD. In addition, the low
incidence of infections and the maintenance of protective
trough levels for total serum IgG demonstrate the efficacy of
IGSC 20 % treatment. Excellent tolerability across all age

 groups enabled infusions to be administered at higher rates
and volumes compared to conventional SC preparations, lead-
ing to shorter infusion durations and fewer infusion sites with
a reflection onto patient experience in terms of treatment in-
terference and convenience.
