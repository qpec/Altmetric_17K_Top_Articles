ABSTRACT
Background Despite over a decade of efforts to
reduce the adverse event rate in healthcare, the
rate has remained relatively unchanged. Root
cause analysis (RCA) is a process used by
hospitals in an attempt to reduce adverse event
rates; however, the outputs of this process have
not been well studied in healthcare. This study
aimed to examine the types of solutions
proposed in RCAs over an 8-year period at a
major academic medical institution.
Methods All state-reportable adverse events
were gathered, and those for which an RCA was
performed were analysed. A consensus rating
process was used to determine a severity rating
for each case. A qualitative approach was used
to categorise the types of solutions proposed by
the RCA team in each case and descriptive
statistics were calculated.
Results 302 RCAs were reviewed. The most
common event types involved a procedure
complication, followed by cardiopulmonary
arrest, neurological deficit and retained foreign
body. In 106 RCAs, solutions were proposed.
A large proportion (38.7%) of RCAs with
solutions proposed involved a patient death. Of
the 731 proposed solutions, the most common
solution types were training (20%), process
change (19.6%) and policy reinforcement
(15.2%). We found that multiple event types
were repeated in the study period, despite
repeated RCAs.
Conclusions This study found that the most
commonly proposed solutions were weaker
actions, which were less likely to decrease event
recurrence. These findings support recent
attempts to improve the RCA process and to
develop guidance for the creation of effective
and sustainable solutions to be used by RCA
teams.
INTRODUCTION
The problem of morbidity and mortality
from adverse events in healthcare has
undergone over 15 years of intense scru-
tiny, funding,
regulation and research
worldwide. Despite dramatically intensi-
fied efforts to increase the safety of the
healthcare system, reports have suggested
that safety has not improved. The adverse
event rate has remained essentially the
same, suggesting that our current solu-
tions to the problem are not working.1–10
This lack of progress persists despite the
devotion of a tremendous amount of
financial and human resources at the
local, state and national levels in an effort
to reduce errors and patient harm.11
One common, resource-intensive, prac-
tice is the root cause analysis (RCA)
process, which is used by most hospitals
in the USA.12–15 The RCA process has
been mandated in response to sentinel
events by the Joint Commission since
1997.16 Although the RCA process has
been presumed to induce change, its
effectiveness has been questioned and
there is not robust literature to support
its efficacy.17 18 In healthcare, there are
reports of difficulty in both determining
the causes (more accurately termed the
contributing factors) of events and devel-
oping and implementing the appropriate
corrective actions.13 19 The goal of the
RCA is twofold. First, the process aims to
determine the contributing factors, with
a focus on the latent hazards in the
system, which contributed to the occur-
rence of the event. The second is to
develop
the
solutions
or
proposed
changes that,
once
implemented,
will
eliminate or reduce the hazard and there-
fore reduce the chance that a similar
event could occur in the future. Previous
publications
on
RCAs
have
largely
involved case reports or editorials, and

 department.20 However, few analyses of the process
itself are available in the literature, and those that
have been done have looked at the types of cases for
which RCAs have been performed or the root causes
identified by the teams.13 21 22 Our team has previ-
ously examined solution types in a small sample of
RCAs, and this study will further contribute by exam-
ining event types and solution types in a larger data
set.23
Although RCAs have been proposed as a mechanism
for change, safety scientists believe that the lack of
improvement of adverse event rates in healthcare is
largely because our methods of approaching change
are ineffective.24 25 RCAs attempt to offer solutions
to effect change, yet few studies have attempted to
categorise or evaluate the recommendations that result
from the process.25 One study showed that fewer than
half of RCAs reviewed included recommendations
directed at robust system-level improvements.21 Many
authors have asserted that recommended actions that
involve education or policy change are inherently
weaker than those that involve redesign of a product
or process, as the former are less likely to introduce
effective and sustained change into the system.17 26–28
Despite the intent to use RCAs to evaluate system-
level problems, studies have shown that RCAs in
healthcare often focus on attempts to fix individuals
rather than on system improvements, while safety
engineering fields show us that system-level interven-
tions are more effective.27–29
Most states, including New York, require RCAs to
be completed after a sentinel event.30 Despite the
large prevalence of the RCA process in adverse event
review and work to identify improved RCA techni-
ques, a systems-based approach to RCAs, and in how
to properly respond to the identified causes in a way
that will increase system safety in a sustained manner,
is not widespread. As a step towards this goal, this
study aims to build on prior work by examining the
types of solutions proposed in response to RCAs con-
ducted at a large, tertiary care academic medical
centre over an 8-year period.
METHODS
This is a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the
content of RCAs performed at one large academic
medical centre over an 8-year period. The goal of the
study was to determine a taxonomy of solution types
proposed by the RCA teams and to determine the
number of solution types for all RCAs reviewed.
Hospital leadership consented to data review and IRB
approval was obtained prior to initiation of data
collection.
Setting
The study was conducted at a 750-bed tertiary care
academic medical centre which, at the time of data
collection, employed 597 graduate medical trainees
across 67 training programmes, and treated 38 000
inpatients, 950 000 outpatients, 98 000 emergency
patients and performed 35 000 surgeries annually.
Mandatory
reporting
was
delivered
to
a
central
agency (New York Patient Occurrence Reporting and
Tracking System, or NYPORTS) for any occurrence,
defined as ‘an unintended adverse and undesirable
development
in
an
individual
patient’s
condition
occurring in a hospital’.30
Protocol
Occurrences were coded by type prior to submission,
according to NYPORTS standards, and any occurrence
coded as a serious reportable event’ required an RCA
be conducted.31 RCAs were done within 30–60 days
following the occurrence. At the study facility, the RCA
was led by a member of the quality team from within
the office of Quality and Safety. The typical RCA team
was six to eight individuals and included one quality
officer and at least one member of physician and
nursing leadership from each involved or affected dis-
cipline. One to two face-to-face meetings were con-
ducted
in
which
involved
parties
were
typically
interviewed, with follow-up emails and phone calls
used to reach consensus on the final report document.
The report was then shared with the hospital’s Safety
and Risk Management Committee, and the Board of
Directors’ Quality and Patient Safety Committee and
uploaded to NYPORTS, which allows analysis of
multi-institutional data.22 The RCA team gave a final
designation to each case, chosen from one of the fol-
lowing: ‘standard of care met, no action needed’,
‘standard of care met with room for improvement’,
‘standard of care not met, attributable to systems’ or
‘standard of care not met, attributable to individual
practitioner’.
Full records of all state-reported incidents at the
study
institution
between
2001
and
2008
were
obtained from the NYPORTS database in the form of
a
Microsoft
Access
database
file
(Redmond,
W
ashington, USA). Data were deidentified, and a
check for duplicates was performed. This database
included all information reported by the hospital to
the reporting agency during the study period. Data
included patient demographic information, a descrip-
tion of the event and the proposed solutions. Only
unique reports that reviewed reportable incidents for
which an RCA was required were included. Cases
designated
as
‘standard
of
care
met,
no
action
needed’, for which no solutions were proposed, were
reviewed in the initial analysis for case type but were
excluded from the analysis of solution types, and no
further analysis of these cases was conducted.
Data analysis
Once the RCA data were compiled, a severity rating
process was performed. In this step, two physicians
with safety experience (RJF and MNS) independently

 reviewed details from each case including the study ID
number,

age
and

and
the
event
summary. Each reviewer assigned a severity category
to the case outcome, using the previously reported
National Coordinating Council for Medication Error
Reporting and Prevention error taxonomy (see online
supplementary appendix 1), in which errors are rated
from A (circumstances or events that have the capacity
to become a hazard) to I (patient death).32
Raters did not attempt to determine causation but
rated the severity of case outcomes based on the infor-
mation available in the RCA. For cases where ratings
were inconsistent by more than two categories, con-
sensus was reached by discussion during a second
meeting. If case ratings were off by only one category,
the more severe outcome was selected. Subsequently,
the data were analysed using Stata (Stata 1C 11,
College Station T
exas, USA).
Next, a qualitative analysis was performed on the
RCA documents. Qualitative research is the optimal
method to develop an understanding of an otherwise
relatively unknown topic and to capture elements that
might
be
missed
in
a
standardised
quantitative
approach with previously determined categories.33
The complete text from each RCA was imported into
Atlas.ti (Berlin, Germany) and reviewed by the quali-
tative analysis team. All three members of the team
(KK, MS, RJF) performed the review for the first 50
cases to generate consistent understandings of the
coding definitions. T
wo members (KK and MS) inde-
pendently reviewed subsequent cases, and inconsistent
results were reviewed by the third member (RJF).
Thematic
analysis
was
performed
using
well-
established qualitative research methods.34 Categories
were created and expanded to iteratively develop a
codebook. Through this standard process, each event
summary was assigned a category. A similar process
was undertaken with each RCA solution until each
was assigned a solution type.34 As part of the same
project, but subsequent to this analysis, solution-type
category definitions for this study have been previ-
ously reported by our team.23
RESULTS
Three hundred and two RCA cases were conducted
during the 8-year study period. Duplicate records
were excluded. All RCAs were included in the initial
analysis; subsequently, those cases proposed solutions
were included in the solutions analysis (figure 1).
Table 1 shows descriptive information for all 302
cases, as well as severity outcome categories for RCAs
in which solutions were proposed (n=106). A large
proportion (38.7%) of RCAs with solutions proposed
involved a patient death. Adverse events resulting in
RCAs occurred throughout the hospital, most fre-
quently in surgical departments (52.6%), with depart-
ments such as psychiatry and neurology submitting
cases with the lowest frequency (2% and 1.3%,
respectively).
The most common event types were procedure
complication, cardiopulmonary arrest, neurological
deficit and retained foreign body (table 2). The least
frequent cases involved electrolyte imbalances, equip-
ment failures or conducting the incorrect study for a
patient. During the study period, several event types

repeated
multiple
times,
including
retained
foreign body, medication administration error and
wrong-site surgery. Figure 2 shows the recurrence of
retained foreign body events during the study period,
despite RCAs being performed for each of these
events.
The average number of solutions proposed per RCA
was 4.7, with 499 total solutions identified in the ana-
lysis (table 3).
The most common category of solutions was train-
ing,
most
often
proposed
as
didactic
teaching,
discussions at faculty/staff meetings or via in-service
training. For example, in a case where a patient suf-
fered neurological complications from an air embol-
ism that occurred during an interventional radiology
procedure, the RCA team stated that, ‘The treatment
of air embolism should be reviewed annually for the
staff in the angio[graphy laboratory] and interven-
tional radiology departments and included as part of
the formal teaching of Interventional Radiology resi-
dents’. Following a case of intraoperative nerve com-
pression resulting in peroneal nerve injury, one of the
proposed solutions was, ‘For educative purposes and
to heighten awareness of the possibility this could
occur due to positioning, this case will be reviewed at
Anesthesia’s…QI
[Quality
Improvement]
Grand
Rounds, and at Orthopedics’ QA [Quality Assurance]
meeting’.
The second most common solution type proposed
was a process change, which could involve a change
in workflow, a clinical protocol or procedures around
communication. These solutions could involve train-
ing staff in the new process. For example, following a
case where a patient had a respiratory arrest upon
transport to MRI from the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit (SICU), a clinical protocol in the form of a
written algorithm was developed to determine the sta-
bility of SICU patients for transfer for non-urgent
diagnostic testing. In another case, an incorrect surgi-
cal count prompted the performance of an abdominal
X-ray; however, the entire abdomen was not imaged,
and thus, a sponge was not identified at the time the
X-ray was read. The proposed process change to
facilitate communication was, ‘The surgeon and the
radiologist should collaborate with regard to the plan
for imaging the area under review’.
The third most commonly proposed solution was
policy reinforcement. In this category, the RCA team

 stated that a policy already in place would be empha-
sised to staff. For example, in another surgical case of
a retained sponge, the RCA team stated, ‘Analysis con-
firmed that our counting policy is effective as written
despite
this
occurrence.
However,
sponge
was
retained. Human error determined to be a factor’,
and
thus
proposed
the
following
solution:
‘Re-emphasise policy and procedures at OR staff
meeting and at the next Perioperative Service Chiefs
meeting’. In a case where two patients on a unit had
the same last name and the wrong patient received a
ventilation/perfusion scan, the RCA team proposed
the following solution: ‘Staff were reminded of the
correct procedure for identifying patients’.
DISCUSSION
This study examined RCAs performed at a major US
academic medical centre over an 8-year period. W
e
determined the categories of cases being reviewed by
the RCA team, as well as the types of solutions pro-
posed to reduce similar future occurrences. Analyses
such as this provide a crucial step to understanding
the RCA process and to provide a framework to facili-
tate future studies that examine the utility of the
process. The safety industry recognises that a hier-
archy of safety interventions exists, the power of
which can lead to greater or lesser improvements in
safety. In its most general form, the hierarchy is as
follows (from most effective to least); (1) Design
changes to remove the hazard, (2) Guard (physically)
against the hazard, (3) W
arn the personnel about the
hazard.35 Relatively few of the solutions offered by
the RCA teams included design of changes to remove
hazards, and we believe that this is representative of
RCAs as performed throughout the USA.
W
e found that in this time period, RCAs were per-
formed for cases from most services in the hospital
with the most common being surgical cases. This
coincided with the fact that the greatest proportion of
cases was related to a procedure complication, the risk
for which is higher during surgery than in other hos-
pital settings, as a higher frequency of procedures are
performed there. The frequency of different types of
cases may also be related to the types of events that
are required to be reported in New York. Our data
showed a high (38.7%) rate of patient death related to
the adverse event; however, there is likely under
reporting of patients who are less severely injured,
making this likely to be an over-representation of
overall severity.36 In figure 2, we show that, despite
repeated RCA team examination of retained foreign
body events, occurrences of that same event continued
throughout the study period. While recognising that
some types of events are impossible to eliminate com-
pletely, we propose that repeat events occur despite
repeat RCAs because of the quality and types of solu-
tions that are proposed by RCA teams.
The effectiveness of the RCA process has been ques-
tioned in the literature previously, but few studies
have critically examined the process as it is used in
healthcare to review sentinel events.14 Many times,
the RCA does not identify meaningful aspects of the
event but simply observes that humans are imperfect.
For example, failures involving people forgetting
something previously known or taught to them simply
observes that human memory is imperfect. This
finding is trivial and will not contribute to sustainable
change without some kind of change in the work
setting to support the cognitive work of the healthcare
worker or reduce the burden of having to remember
critical pieces of information. Additionally, in health-
care, many errors are ‘slips’ or ‘lapses’ that occur
when the practitioner is in automaticity mode and is
not consciously thinking about his or her actions. To
begin to address errors due to ‘slips’ and ‘lapses’, the
conditions under which these errors occur must be
identified.37
38
Systems-based
changes
have
been
found to be most effective in mitigating safety in
other industries; however, this has not yet become a
standard of practice in patient safety in healthcare.
Our data around policy reinforcement highlights
one of the most compelling demonstrations of the
ineffectiveness of RCAs, as they have historically been
performed in the USA. In what resilience engineers
would refer to as the ‘work as imagined’ space, we see
solutions such as reminding staff of the correct pro-
cedure, and human error was determined to be a
factor. This violates the basic premise of safety engin-
eering involving sociotechnical systems, which recog-
nises that human errors will always be repeated. Just
as our parents taught us when we were toddlers,
human error is inevitable, thereby proposing a solu-
tion for safety mitigation that focuses on reminding
people not to make mistakes is an indictment of our
approach to safety.
W
ork done by our team examined the same categories
of RCA solutions discussed here and, through front-line
personnel and discussions with safety science experts,
developed a model of sustainability and effectiveness for
solutions.23 In that study
, the categories developed in
this project were used to determine the effectiveness
and sustainability of different solutions proposed by
RCA teams. This work showed that solutions, such as
technology changes and institutional-level changes,
were most effective and sustainable, and solutions, such
as counselling and disciplinary changes, were the least
effective and sustainable. This study can serve as a basis
for future analyses of the effectiveness of the RCA
process for preventing similar future occurrences.
It is clear that RCA teams need validated tools to
use when proposing solutions in order to meet the
goal of reducing future similar outcomes. However,
no trials have examined the effectiveness of the
process or its proposed solutions.10 Therefore, more
work
needs

 interventions and evaluate their quality. RCA teams
need guidance on solution types and the timing of
their implication, and this needs to be validated in
order to propose the most effective solutions for
change. W
ork needs to be done to determine how to
study near misses and hazards to include information
from these events in proposed solutions, as these
events are often incredibly informative and predictive
of future events but are often not evaluated.
There are limitations of this study, which should be
considered when interpreting our results. This study
was performed at a single institution. However, this
institution performs RCAs in a manner similar to
other major medical centres across the country and is
in accordance with Joint Commission recommenda-
tions.39 A multicentre study of RCAs is needed in the
future, as studies of the RCA process are scarce.
While an 8-year period is likely representative of the
types of RCAs and the solutions proposed, examining
a greater length of time might also reveal more about
the process. W
e were unable to review each case in
detail and each solution in context, as this information
was not submitted to NYPORTS, which may have
yielded more information about the derivation of the
different solutions.
CONCLUSION
Our study evaluates the RCA process as performed at
a major medical centre, building on prior work to
classify and understand the recommendations being
made by RCA teams. Our results show that certain
event types are seen repeatedly, even following recom-
mendations from RCA teams. Our qualitative analysis
reveals that solution types most commonly proposed
are not usually the types shown to be more effective
and sustainable in other industries. Our study high-
lights the need for further critical evaluation of the
RCA process in healthcare in order to understand if
and how the process can be improved to meet the
goal of reducing error and increasing patient safety.
