Despite the critical need, no previous research has substantiated
safe opioid analgesics without abuse liability in primates. Recent
advances in medicinal chemistry have led to the development of
ligands with mixed mu opioid peptide (MOP)/nociceptin-orphanin
FQ peptide (NOP) receptor agonist activity to achieve this objective.
BU08028 is a novel orvinol analog that displays a similar binding
profile to buprenorphine with improved affinity and efficacy at
NOP receptors. The aim of this preclinical study was to establish
the functional profile of BU08028 in monkeys using clinically used
MOP receptor agonists for side-by-side comparisons in various well-
honed behavioral and physiological assays. Systemic BU08028
(0.001–0.01 mg/kg) produced potent long-lasting (i.e., >24 h) anti-
nociceptive and antiallodynic effects, which were blocked by
MOP or NOP receptor antagonists. More importantly, the rein-
forcing strength of BU08028 was significantly lower than that of
cocaine, remifentanil, or buprenorphine in monkeys responding un-
der a progressive-ratio schedule of drug self-administration. Unlike
MOP receptor agonists, BU08028 at antinociceptive doses and ∼10-
to 30-fold higher doses did not cause respiratory depression or car-
diovascular adverse events as measured by telemetry devices.
After repeated administration, the monkeys developed acute
physical dependence on morphine, as manifested by precipitated
withdrawal signs, such as increased respiratory rate, heart rate,
and blood pressure. In contrast, monkeys did not show physical
dependence on BU08028. These in vivo findings in primates not
only document the efficacy and tolerability profile of bifunctional
MOP/NOP receptor agonists, but also provide a means of trans-
lating such ligands into therapies as safe and potentially abuse-
free opioid analgesics.

P
ain, a symptom of numerous clinical disorders, afflicts millions
of people worldwide. Despite the remarkable advances in the
identification of potential targets as analgesics in the last decade,
mu opioid peptide (MOP) receptor agonists remain the most
widely used analgesics for pain management (1). Several side ef-
fects associated with MOP receptor agonists have severely limited
the value of opioid analgesics, however (2). Owing to the abuse
liability and the high mortality rate caused by respiratory arrest,
opioid abuse not only has dire consequences, but also leads to
mounting medical and economic burdens in our society (3–5).
There is a clear, unmet need for safe analgesics without abuse
liability in the global community.
Buprenorphine, a partial MOP receptor agonist, is considered
a safe analgesic because of its ceiling effect on respiratory de-
pression (6, 7). Buprenorphine is commonly used in both human
and veterinary medicine to treat various pain conditions, in-
cluding cancer pain and neuropathic pain (7, 8). However,
buprenorphine is not devoid of reinforcing effects, the most
devastating side effect of MOP receptor agonists. The abuse or
misuse of buprenorphine has been documented, which limits its
use worldwide (9–11). There has been a decades-long effort aimed
at developing opioid analgesics with fewer side effects (12–15), but
to date, safe opioid analgesics devoid of abuse potential remain
undiscovered (16, 17).
Recent research on the nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP)
receptor could open an avenue for developing new analgesics. (17–
20). Following spinal and systemic administration, NOP receptor
agonists produce antinociception and antihypersensitivity comparable
to those of MOP receptor agonists, but without reinforcing effects in
nonhuman primates (21–24). More importantly, NOP agonists in-
teract with buprenorphine in a synergistic manner to produce
antinociceptive effects (25). Simultaneous activation of both NOP
and MOP receptors to a small degree may produce desirable an-
algesic effects with fewer side effects—that is, a wider therapeutic
window (17). Given that NOP receptor agonists have no abuse li-
ability and/or can block or decrease the reinforcing effects of MOP
receptor agonists (26–29), it is worth developing bifunctional MOP/
NOP receptor agonists as potentially non-addictive analgesics.
Several medicinal chemistry groups have discovered such ago-
nists with varying affinity and efficacy at MOP and NOP receptors
(30–33). Subsequent to chemical modifications, some of these li-
gands exhibited antinociceptive and antihypersensitive efficacy
with improved potency across different rodent pain models (31,
34–36). However, in vivo functional profiles of these ligands in
primates are completely unknown. Among these recently de-
veloped ligands, BU08028 emerged from the orvinol series and
displays a similar receptor binding profile to buprenorphine, but
with better binding affinity (Ki, ∼8 nM) and efficacy (∼48%
stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding) on NOP receptors (37, 38).
Therefore, BU08028 appears to be an ideal pharmacologic agent
with mixed MOP/NOP agonist activity that merits further study.
Significance
A potent opioid analgesic without addictive and respiratory
adverse effects has been a predominant goal for opioid medic-
inal chemistry since the isolation of morphine from opium in the
19th century. Here we report a functional profile of a unique
analog, BU08028, targeting a combination of a classical and
nonclassical opioid receptors in monkeys. By examining behav-
ioral, physiological, and pharmacologic factors, the present
study demonstrates that BU08028 exhibits full antinociception
and antihypersensitivity without reinforcing effects (i.e., abuse
liability), respiratory depression, pruritus, adverse cardiovascular
events, or acute physical dependence. Because monkey models
provide the most phylogenetically appropriate evaluation of
opioid receptor functions and drug effects, these findings pro-
vide a translational bridge for such ligands as effective analge-
sics without safety and abuse liability concerns.

SEE COMMENTARY
 Numerous studies have documented differences in the phar-
macologic actions of MOP-related ligands (15, 39, 40) and NOP-
related ligands (24, 41, 42) between rodents and nonhuman pri-
mates. In particular, the abuse liability and respiratory depression
of MOP receptor agonists in humans can be most closely simu-
lated in monkeys (43–45). Thus, it is extremely valuable to conduct
functional studies in awake, behaving monkeys as a preclinical
framework to validate the therapeutic profile of BU08028, and
also to establish a translational bridge for the bifunctional MOP/
NOP receptor agonists in humans. In the present study, we con-
ducted large-scale experiments using various well-established be-
havioral and physiological assays to provide a comprehensive
pharmacologic profile of BU08028 in nonhuman primates. Using
prototypical MOP receptor agonists for comparison, we in-
vestigated the characteristics of BU08028 as an analgesic and its
reinforcing effects and physiological functions, including pruritus,
respiration, and cardiovascular activities. In addition, we applied a
short-term repeated-dosing regimen to evaluate the development
of acute physical dependence on BU08028.
Results
BU08028 Produces Potent and Long-Lasting Antinociceptive and
Antiallodynic Effects. After s.c. administration, BU08028 produced
antinociceptive effects against an acute noxious stimulus, 50 °C
water, in a dose-dependent [F(3, 9) = 72.3; P < 0.05] and time-
dependent [F(9, 27) = 16.1; P < 0.05] manner (Fig. 1A). The
minimum effective dose of BU08028 to produce full antinociception
was 0.01 mg/kg. The duration of action produced by this dose was
30 h, and it subsided by 48 h. To determine the antihypersensitive
efficacy of BU08028, we used a clinically relevant model, capsaicin-
induced allodynia, which has been widely applied to evaluate
analgesics in humans (46, 47). Systemic BU08028 attenuated
capsaicin-induced thermal allodynia in 46 °C water both dose-
dependently [F(3, 9) = 360.8; P < 0.05] and time-dependently
[F(3, 9) = 42.2; P < 0.05] (Fig. 1B).
We next conducted antagonist studies using a MOP receptor-
selective dose of the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone and
the selective NOP receptor antagonist J-113397 (21, 23). Pre-
treatment with a single dose of naltrexone (0.03 mg/kg) or J-113397
(0.1 mg/kg) produced similar degrees (dose ratios approximately
threefold) of the rightward shift of the dose–response curve for
BU08028-induced antinociception (Fig. 1C). These findings in-
dicate that MOP and NOP receptors contributed equally to the
antinociceptive effects of BU08028. Using the same group of
subjects, we further compared the potency and duration of action
of BU08028 and buprenorphine. Based on the dose–response
curves, systemic BU08028 was more potent than buprenorphine
(ED50 = 0.003 mg/kg vs. 0.03 mg/kg) (Fig. 1D), and the anti-
nociceptive duration of BU08028 0.01 mg/kg was much longer than
that of buprenorphine 0.1 mg/kg (>24 h vs. 1–6 h) (Fig. 1E).
To examine whether BU08028 elicits itch sensation, we com-
pared its effects with the MOP receptor agonist fentanyl, which was
previously shown to elicit scratching responses in monkeys (48).
Although BU08028 0.01 mg/kg produced potent and long-lasting
antinociceptive and antihypersensitive effects, it did not signifi-
cantly increase scratching responses [F(1, 3) = 4.5; P = 0.1]. In
contrast, fentanyl 0.018 mg/kg elicited scratching responses in a time-
dependent manner in the same subjects [F(1, 3) = 15.4; P < 0.05]
(Fig. 1F). These findings strongly indicate that systemic BU08028 has
a promising analgesic profile in primates.
BU08028 Does Not Have Reinforcing Effects. To examine and com-
pare the reinforcing strengths of drugs, we used a progressive-ratio
(PR) schedule of reinforcement that has been commonly used for
evaluating abuse potential (49–51). For these studies, monkeys
were trained to self-administer cocaine and various doses of the
MOP receptor agonists remifentanil and buprenorphine, as well as
BU08028. For all monkeys, substitution of saline for the mainte-
nance dose of cocaine (0.03 mg/kg per injection) resulted in a low
number of reinforcers (three or fewer injections) within approxi-
mately five sessions. There was a main effect of dose for remifentanil

 [F(4,12) = 21.8; P < 0.05] and buprenorphine [F(4,12) = 8.9; P <
0.05], but not for BU08028. Several doses of remifentanil and
buprenorphine functioned as reinforcers (Fig. 2A). One-way
ANOVA revealed an expected difference in peak reinforcers de-
livered across drugs [F(3,9) = 28.9; P < 0.05]. The peak number of
reinforcers for remifentanil and buprenorphine differed significantly
from each other, as well as from saline and BU08028. The peak
numbers of self-administered injections of saline and BU08028
were not different (Fig. 2B). Overall, the reinforcing strength of
BU08028 was significantly lower than that of cocaine, remifentanil,
and buprenorphine and no different from that of saline.
Higher Doses of BU08028 Do Not Compromise Physiological Functions.
To characterize the safety profile of BU08028, we implanted ra-
diotelemetric transmitters in monkeys for real-time measurements of
different physiological functions (52). A systemic dose (0.01 mg/kg)
of BU08028 that produced full antinociceptive effects did not
significantly affect the respiratory function of freely moving mon-
keys, i.e., no respiratory depression (Fig. 3 A–E). More impor-
tantly, at a dose (0.1 mg/kg) that is ∼10–30 times higher than its
antinociceptive doses (0.003–0.01 mg/kg), BU08028 did not cause
any significant decreases across various respiratory parameters
including respiratory rate, minute volume, tidal volume, peak in-
spiratory and expiratory flow (all F values 0.3–3; P > 0.1) during
the 48-h observation period (Fig. 3 A–E). In stark contrast, an
antinociceptive dose of fentanyl (0.056 mg/kg) (53) rapidly caused
respiratory depression in a single monkey, which was reversed by a
MOP receptor antagonist naltrexone (Fig. 3A, Inset). For safety
reasons, this particular experiment was conducted in only one
monkey. In addition, neither dose of BU08028 caused bradycardia
or hypotension (Fig. 4 A and D). By examining various electro-
cardiography (ECG) parameters, we found that neither dose of
BU08028 significantly changed any cardiovascular measures.
Herein we show the ECG parameters such as QRS, ST-E, and
pulse height, and the body temperature remained unchanged in
monkeys receiving 0.1 mg/kg of BU08028 (Fig. 4 B, C, E, and F)
(all F values 0.2–2; P > 0.3). These findings clearly illustrate that
unlike standard MOP receptor agonists, BU08028 is a safe anal-
gesic in primates.
Repeated Administration of BU08028 Does Not Produce Acute Physical
Dependence. Following repeated exposure to antinociceptive doses
of MOP receptor agonists, monkeys quickly develop acute physical
dependence, as revealed by the emergence of withdrawal signs
after administration of an opioid receptor antagonist (40, 54).
Using similar repeated-dosing regimens, we compared the devel-
opment of physical dependence on the MOP receptor agonist
morphine, the NOP receptor agonist SCH221510, and the mixed
MOP/NOP agonist BU08028 in the same subjects. Antagonist-
precipitated withdrawal signs were measured in monkeys implan-
ted with the telemetric device described above.
Compared with the vehicle-treated condition (0.1 mL/kg twice
daily for 3 d), naltrexone (0.01 mg/kg) precipitated withdrawal
signs on day 4 in morphine-treated (1.8 mg/kg twice daily for 3 d)
monkeys. These withdrawal signs were manifested by increases in
respiratory rate [F(1, 3) = 18.1; P < 0.05], minute volume [F(1, 3) =
124.3; P < 0.05], heart rate [F(1, 3) = 17.3; P < 0.05], and mean
arterial pressure [F(1, 3) = 24.9; P < 0.05] without changes in body
temperature [F(1, 3) = 0.4; P > 0.5] (Fig. 5 A–E). For a side-by-side
comparison, following repeated administration of SCH221510
(0.01 mg/kg twice daily for 3 d), J-113397 (0.03 mg/kg) did not
precipitate withdrawal signs, with no changes in all physiological
parameters detected (all F values 0.02–0.8; P > 0.4) (Fig. 5 F–J).
More importantly, after repeated administration of BU08028
(0.01 mg/kg once daily for 3 d), the combination of naltrexone and
J-113397 at the same doses did not precipitate withdrawal signs (all
F values 0.4–2.5; P > 0.1) (Fig. 5 K–O). Taken together, the
foregoing findings indicate that, unlike morphine, selective NOP
receptor agonist SCH221510 and bifunctional MOP/NOP receptor
agonist BU08028 do not produce acute physical dependence fol-
lowing 3 d of repeated administration.
Discussion
This first-in-primate study demonstrates that an orvinol analog
(BU08028) with mixed MOP/NOP agonist activity displays a
promising efficacy and tolerability profile as an analgesic following
acute and repeated administration. The study provides four sig-
nificant findings with direct translational impact on the develop-
ment of safe opioid analgesics without abuse liability. First,
BU08028 is highly potent, producing long-lasting antinociceptive
and antihypersensitive actions mediated by both MOP and NOP
receptors. Second, BU08028 does not have reinforcing effects
under conditions in which other drugs with known abuse liability
in the global community (including cocaine, remifentanil, and
buprenorphine) function as reinforcers. Third, unlike the MOP
receptor agonist fentanyl, BU08028 is safe and does not inhibit
respiratory and cardiovascular activities at or above analgesic
doses. Fourth, unlike the commonly used opioid analgesic mor-
phine, repeated administration of BU08028 does not produce
acute physical dependence.
BU08028 exhibits an extra-long duration of antinociceptive and
antiallodynic actions, up to 30 h. To our knowledge, this is the sole
analgesic with such a long duration of action in nonhuman pri-
mates. The high logP value of BU08028 could contribute to its
unique pharmacokinetic profile (30, 38). More interestingly, an-
tagonist studies have demonstrated that both MOP and NOP

 receptors contribute to BU08028-induced antinociception in
primates. This is in contrast to rodent studies showing that pre-
treatment with a NOP receptor antagonist potentiated BU08028-
induced antinociception (38). Nonetheless, the functional profile
of BU08028 in monkeys provides proof of concept that a single
molecule with mixed MOP and NOP agonist activity is more po-
tent than selective ligands and devoid of MOP receptor-mediated
side effects (17, 25).
On the other hand, capsaicin-induced allodynia has significant
value in studying pain mechanisms and pharmacologic interven-
tions in humans (46, 47). Given that capsaicin-sensitive nerve fibers
are involved in a variety of pain conditions, the full effectiveness of
BU08028 in inhibiting capsaicin-induced allodynia may indicate its
clinically relevant analgesic efficacy. In addition, rodent studies
have demonstrated the analgesic efficacy of NOP-related agonists
across diverse pain modalities, including inflammatory pain, neu-
ropathic pain, and sickle cell pain (18, 20, 22, 29). Cumulative
evidence supports a broad application of NOP-related agonists
as analgesics.
In dramatic contrast to cocaine, remifentanil, and buprenor-
phine, BU08028 does not possess detectable reinforcing strength
when self-administration is studied under a PR schedule of re-
inforcement. Under a PR schedule, the response requirement for
delivery of each reinforcer is successively increased. PR schedules
measure how many responses subjects will emit to receive a drug
injection before they cease to respond. The value of this schedule
for assessing abuse liability is that it can provide an empirical
differentiation among drugs that function as positive reinforcers
(49–51). Remifentanil and buprenorphine exhibit strong and mild-
to-moderate reinforcing strengths, respectively, in monkeys under
the PR schedule, concordant with their abuse potential in hu-
mans (4, 9).
The present study also distinguishes between remifentanil and
buprenorphine in terms of reinforcing strength. The lack of rein-
forcing effects of BU08028 under the same PR schedule as the
other three drugs clearly suggests that this drug has lower abuse
potential than buprenorphine in humans. Considering that the
peak reinforcing strength of BU08028 does not differ from that of
saline, the results go a step further to suggest that BU08028 has
zero abuse potential. Given the decades-long effort aimed at de-
veloping abuse-free opioid analgesics (16, 17), BU08028 repre-
sents a major breakthrough for opioid medicinal chemistry.
Opioid analgesics are often associated with compromised
physiological functions, particularly respiratory depression, which
directly relates to mortality rates for pain management and over-
dose in addicted persons (4, 5, 55). The present study investigated
the acute effects of BU08028 on physiological functions by mea-
suring both respiratory and cardiovascular parameters simulta-
neously in the same group of freely moving monkeys implanted
with a radiotelemetry device. Impedance-based measurement of
respiratory function has been extensively described in humans, and
the approach of combined cardiopulmonary assessments has been
validated in monkeys (56). The basal values of these physio-
logical parameters in this study are in line with those reported

 in rhesus monkeys (40, 52, 54). BU08028 at antinociceptive
doses and ∼10- to 30-fold higher doses did not cause signifi-
cantly respiratory depression or adverse cardiovascular events,
whereas fentanyl produced a rapid, severe decrease in respi-
ratory rate. Of note, a buprenorphine-like agonist, BU72, displayed
a wide therapeutic window in mice, but its safety pharmacology
profile could not be translated to primates owing to its respiratory
depressant effects (15). BU08028 represents a safe opioid analge-
sic with a much wider therapeutic window than that of MOP
receptor agonists.
Acute physical dependence occurs after fairly short-term (i.e.,
1–3 d) administration of opioids in monkeys and humans (40, 54,
57). With precipitated withdrawal, distinctive withdrawal signs can
be detected by administration of a cognate receptor antagonist.
Using the same telemetry device, we found that administration of
naltrexone significantly increased respiratory rate, minute volume,
heart rate, and blood pressure in morphine-treated monkeys. These
findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the de-
velopment of acute physical dependence on morphine in nonhuman
primates (40, 54), and validate respiratory and cardiovascular
parameters as reliable and quantitative indicators of antagonist-
precipitated withdrawal. More importantly, under the same repeated-
dosing regimen with doses producing full antinociception, neither the
NOP receptor agonist SCH221510 nor BU08028 produced acute
physical dependence. These results further support the notion that
unlike MOP receptor agonists, NOP-related agonists have less
liability to develop physical dependence following a short-term
exposure.
In the context of chronic pain management, development of
opioid analgesic tolerance occurs and is attributed to several factors,

 including aggravation of pain, neuroadaptation of MOP re-
ceptors, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (3, 4, 58). Owing to
ethical concerns, there is no chronic pain model in nonhuman
primates. Nonetheless, repeated intrathecal or i.p. administration
of drugs with dual MOP/NOP receptor agonist activity (e.g.,
SR16435, cebranopadol) was found to result in slower develop-
ment of tolerance to their antiallodynic effects compared with
MOP agonists in rodents under neuropathic pain (35, 36). Mor-
phine and buprenorphine have different analgesic potencies and
tolerance development in humans, with a faster onset of tolerance
to morphine (6, 59). Based on well-justified doses and duration of
action, future studies will further determine whether chronic ad-
ministration of BU08028 has a slower development of tolerance to
its antinociceptive effects compared with morphine and bupre-
norphine in nonhuman primates.
To our knowledge, the present study provides the first func-
tional evidence in nonhuman primates that BU08028 with mixed
MOP/NOP agonist activities is an effective and safe analgesic
without apparent abuse liability or other opioid-associated side
effects. These in vivo findings strongly support the hypothesis
that coactivation of MOP and NOP receptors can widen the
therapeutic window through their synergistic interactions (17). In
recent years, medicinal chemists have developed bifunctional
MOP/NOP receptor agonists with a wide range of efficacies (i.e.,
from low to moderate to full efficacy) (19, 29, 30, 33). Because
ligands with differential intrinsic efficacies for activating MOP
and NOP receptors have distinct integrated functional outcomes,
it is essential that their efficacy and tolerability profiles (e.g., abuse
liability, respiratory depression, physical dependence) be studied in
awake, behaving monkeys. Such pharmacologic studies not only
will validate the therapeutic profiles of bifunctional MOP/NOP
receptor agonists, but also will translate candidate drugs into
therapies as safe, abuse-free analgesics that are long overdue in the

Animals. All animal care and experimental procedures were conducted in ac-
cordance with the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and approved by Wake Forest University’s Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. This study is reported in accordance with the
ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines for
reporting experiments involving animals (60). Twelve adult male and female
rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), age 10–17 y and weight 6.5–13 kg, were
kept at an indoor facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. Animals were housed
individually in species-specific rooms with environmental controls set to
maintain 21–25 °C, 40–60% relative humidity, and a 12-h light (06:30–18:30)/
12-h dark cycle. The daily diet consisted of ∼20–28 biscuits (Purina Monkey
Chow; Ralston Purina) and fresh fruit and water ad libitum. Small amounts of
nonhuman primate treats and various cage-enrichment devices were supplied
as forms of environmental enrichment. Animals were not exposed to any
opioid compound for 1 mo before the present study.
Nociceptive Responses.
Acute thermal nociception. The warm water tail-withdrawal assay was used to
evaluate thermal antinociceptive effects of BU08028 and MOP receptor ago-
nists (21). Monkeys were seated in primate restraint chairs in a designated
procedure room, and the lower parts of their shaved tails (∼15 cm) were im-
mersed in a thermal flask containing water maintained at 42, 46, or 50 °C.
Water at 42 and 46 °C was used as nonnoxious stimuli, and water at 50 °C
served as an acute noxious stimulus. All tail-withdrawal latencies were mea-
sured at each temperature using a computerized timer by investigators who
were unaware of the experimental conditions. If a monkey did not remove its
tail within 20 s (cutoff), the flask was removed, and a maximum time of
20 s was recorded.
Test sessions began with baseline measurements at each temperature.
Subsequent tail-withdrawal latencies were measured at multiple time points
after s.c. administration of a single dose of test compound. For dose–response
curves, the test compound was administered by a cumulative dosing procedure
with a 30-min interinjection interval. Tail-withdrawal latencies were measured
at 20 min after each injection. A single dose of MOP receptor-selective an-
tagonist naltrexone (0.03 mg/kg) or NOP receptor-selective antagonist J-113397
(0.1 mg/kg) was administered s.c. at 15 min before determination of dose–
response curves to compare their antagonist effects against BU08028-induced
antinociception. The doses and pretreatment time for both naltrexone and
J-113397 were chosen based on previous studies (23, 25).
Capsaicin-induced thermal allodynia. At multiple time points after s.c. adminis-
tration of BU08028, 0.3 mL of capsaicin at 1.2 mg/mL was administered topically
via a bandage attached on the terminal 3–5 cm of the tail for 15 min (61). The
allodynic effects of capsaicin peak at 15 min after removal of the capsaicin
bandage, and this is the time at which to measure the tail-withdrawal latency
in 46 °C water to evaluate the antiallodynic effects of the test compound. This
allodynic response was manifested as reduced tail-withdrawal latency from a
maximum value of 20 s to ∼2–3 s in 46 °C water (21, 61).
Itch Scratching Responses. The monkeys’ behaviors were recorded in their
home cages for scratching activity, which has been associated previously with
itch sensation (48). Each 15-min recording session was conducted at multiple
time points after s.c. administration of BU08028 or fentanyl. A scratch was
defined as one brief (<1 s) episode of scraping contact of the forepaw or
hindpaw on the skin surface. Total scratches were counted and summed
for each 15-min time block by experimenters who were unaware of the
experimental conditions.
Drug Self-Administration. Four monkeys with indwelling i.v. catheters and s.c.
vascular access ports were used. Monkeys had been trained previously to self-
administer (−)cocaine HCl (National Institute on Drug Abuse) under a PR
schedule of reinforcement in sessions that started at ∼3:00 PM each day. Be-
fore each session, the pump was operated for ∼30 s to fill the catheter with
the drug solution available for that session. Under the PR schedule, white
lights were illuminated above the right lever and 50 responses resulted in a
10-s injection, extinguishing of white lights and illumination of red lights for
10 s. During a 10-min timeout period, no lights were illuminated and
responding had no scheduled consequences. The response requirement for
subsequent injections was determined by the exponential equation used by
Richardson and Roberts (1996), ratio = [5 × e(R × 0.2)] – 5, where e is the
mathematical constant and R is equal to the reinforcer number.
For the present study, the first response requirement (50 responses) corre-
sponds to the 12th value given by this equation and was followed by 62, 77,
95,117, 144, 177, 218, 267, 328, 402, 492, 602, 737, 901, 1,102, 1,347, etc. Sessions
ended when 2 h elapsed without an injection. Initially, the monkeys’
responding was maintained by injections of 0.03 mg/kg cocaine until
responding was stable (mean ± three injections for three consecutive sessions
with no trend). Next, dose-effect curves were determined in each monkey by
substituting saline and a range of doses of remifentanil (0.03‒1 μg/kg per in-
jection), buprenorphine (1‒30 μg/kg per injection) or BU08028 (0.3‒30 μg/kg
per injection) for the maintenance dose in a quasi-random order. Doses were
available for at least five consecutive sessions and until responding was
deemed stable. The dependent variable of primary interest was the number of
drug injections earned under the PR schedule. The order of testing was
remifentanil, buprenorphine, and BU08028.
Surgical Implantation of Telemetry Device. Before surgery, animals were given
atropine (0.04 mg/kg s.c.), buprenorphine (0.01–0.03 mg/kg i.m.), and cefo-
taxime (500 mg i.v.) for pain management and to prevent inflammation and
infection. The animals were then anesthetized with ketamine (10 mg/kg
i.m.), and a catheter was placed in a saphenous vein for administration of
lactated Ringer’s solution during the surgery. The animals were intubated
and maintained under anesthesia with inhaled isoflurane or sevoflurane (1–
2% in 1 L/min O2). The animals were placed in dorsal recumbency for sur-
gery. The surgical sites were prepared for strict aseptic surgery by cleansing
with povidone-iodine, followed by 70% isopropyl alcohol. Vital signs,
including heart rate, respiration rate, indirect blood pressure, and body
temperature, were monitored during the surgery and in the immediate
postoperative recovery period. The animals received buprenorphine (0.003–
0.02 mg/kg i.m.) and meloxicam (0.15 mg/kg s.c.) as postoperative analgesics
and ceftiofur (2.2 mg/kg i.m.) as the postoperative antibiotic. Postoperative
care and incision site observations were performed daily for 14 d or until
healing was complete.
A cardiopulmonary telemetry transmitter [model TL11M3-D70-PCTR; Data
Sciences International (DSI)] was surgically implanted into each of four mon-
keys. This transmitter device was placed between the internal and external
abdominal oblique muscles on the flank, and the green ground lead was placed
intramuscularly near the device body. The blood pressure catheter was inserted
into the femoral artery with the pressure-sensing tip in the aorta. The positive
ECG lead was placed on the abdominal side of the diaphragm near the apex of

 the left ventricle. The solid-tip negative ECG lead was placed into the cranial
vena cava via the right internal jugular vein. The final depth of positioning was
determined based on optimization of a live telemetry signal. Two respiratory
impedance leads were placed intramuscularly on each side of the chest along
the transverse plane of the seventh rib. Both negative leads (white stripes) were
placed on the right side of the chest, and both positive leads (solid colors) were
placed on the left side. The violet leads were placed cranial to the seventh rib,
and the turquoise leads were placed caudal to the seventh rib. All of the leads
were cut to the appropriate length. The insulation was removed, and the
exposed wire was looped and secured with suture before placement. After
initial placement of leads and before the leads were secured to the tissue, base
impedance was optimized by repositioning the leads, and the impedance value
was verified by monitoring a live respiratory signal using DSI hardware and
software. The depth of breathing was verified to ensure signal quality.
Physiological Responses. Four freely moving monkeys implanted with the D70-
PCTR telemetry transmitter were used to evaluate the effects of BU08028 and
MOP receptor agonists on physiological parameters. Respiration, blood pres-
sure, ECG, and temperature were measured and analyzed with Ponemah
version 5.2 (Data Sciences International). For acute drug effects, data from the
30-min interval before drug administration were collected as baseline and then
at each time point (i.e., 1, 6, 24, and 48 h) after drug administration. For
detecting precipitated withdrawal signs, data from the 30-min duration before
administration of antagonist were collected and then continuously for 2 h after
antagonist administration. The mean value of each 15-min time block was
generated from each subject to represent the measure outcome for each single
data point.
Data Analysis. Mean ± SEM values were calculated from individual-subject
data for all behavioral endpoints. Comparisons were made for the same
monkeys across all test sessions in the same experiment. All data except self-
administration data were analyzed by repeated-measures two-way ANOVA,
followed by Bonferroni’s multiple-comparisons test. For each drug used in the
self-administration paradigm, repeated-measures one-way ANOVA was con-
ducted with the post hoc Dunnett’s test to determine which doses functioned
as reinforcers. In addition, maximum reinforcing strength, defined as the peak
number of reinforcers that a monkey earned regardless of dose, was compared
across drugs using repeated-measures one-way ANOVA and a Holm–Sidak
multiple-comparisons test. The criterion for significance for all tests was set at
P < 0.05. To analyze nociceptive responses, individual tail-withdrawal latencies
were converted to the percentage of maximum possible effect. The formula for
calculating the percentage of maximum possible effect was as follows: [(test
latency ‒ control latency)/(cutoff latency, 20 s ‒ control latency)] × 100.
Drugs. BU08028 HCl (37) (University of Bath) was dissolved in a solution of
dimethyl sulfoxide/10% (mass/vol) (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin in a ratio
of 3:97. Morphine sulfate, buprenorphine HCl, fentanyl HCl, remifentanil HCl,
and naltrexone HCl (National Institute on Drug Abuse) were dissolved in sterile
water. The (‒)cocaine HCl (National Institute on Drug Abuse) was dissolved in
sterile 0.9% saline. J-113397 and SCH221510 (Tocris Bioscience) were dissolved
in a solution of dimethyl sulfoxide/Tween 80/sterile water in a ratio of 1:1:8.
Capsaicin (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 70% (vol/vol) ethanol. For systemic
administration, drugs were administered at a volume of 0.1 mL/kg. There was
a minimum 1-wk interval between drug administrations.
