l Among adults with
MRD-positive ALL in
hematologic remission
after chemotherapy,
78% achieved a
complete MRD
response with
blinatumomab.
l Complete MRD
response after
blinatumomab
treatment in this
population was
associated with
significantly improved
OS.
Approximately 30% to 50% of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in hematologic
complete remission after multiagent therapy exhibit minimal residual disease (MRD) by reverse
transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction or flow cytometry. MRD is the strongest predictor of
relapse in ALL. In this open-label, single-arm study, adults with B-cell precursor ALL in he-
matologic complete remission with MRD (‡1023) received blinatumomab 15 mg/m2 per day by
continuous IV infusion for up to 4 cycles. Patients could undergo allogeneic hematopoietic
stem-cell transplantation any time after cycle 1. The primary end point was complete MRD
response status after 1 cycle of blinatumomab. One hundred sixteen patients received
blinatumomab. Eighty-eight (78%) of 113 evaluable patients achieved a complete MRD response.
In the subgroup of 110 patients with Ph-negative ALL in hematologic remission, the Kaplan-
Meier estimate of relapse-free survival (RFS) at 18 months was 54%. Median overall survival
(OS) was 36.5 months. In landmark analyses, complete MRD responders had longer RFS (23.6
vs 5.7 months; P 5 .002) and OS (38.9 vs 12.5 months; P 5 .002) compared with MRD non-
responders. Adverse events were consistent with previous studies of blinatumomab. Twelve
(10%) and 3 patients (3%) had grade 3 or 4 neurologic events, respectively. Four patients
(3%) had cytokine release syndrome grade 1, n 5 2; grade 3, n 5 2), all during cycle 1. After
treatment with blinatumomab in a population of patients with MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL, a majority achieved a
complete MRD response, which was associated with significantly longer RFS and OS compared with MRD nonre-
sponders. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01207388. (Blood. 2018;131(14):1522-1531)
Introduction
Preemptive treatment of malignant disease after remission in
patients with low but measurable disease may prolong overall
survival (OS) compared with treatment of overt relapse.1 In acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), minimal residual disease (MRD) is
defined as the presence of leukemic cells not detectable by
microscopy and may be measured by standardized methods
with a sensitivity of 1024 (ie, 0.01%).2
Despite intensive induction/consolidation chemotherapy with
hematologic complete remission (CR) rates of 80% to 90%,
approximately 30% to 50% of adult patients with ALL and 10%
to 20% of pediatric patients with ALL in CR exhibit MRD.3-8
MRD persistence or recurrence indicates resistance to standard
chemotherapy and is the most important risk factor for
hematologic relapse in T-cell and B-cell ALL.9-13 For adult pa-
tients, 5-year hematologic relapse rates range from 56% to
100% for MRD positivity, compared with 18% to 33% for
MRD negativity.4,5,14 Up to 70% of patients have an MRD level
.1023 after achieving CR, and their median duration of hema-
tologic remission is 4.9 months.5 A meta-analysis of 16 studies,
comprising 2076 adults with ALL, concluded that MRD negativity
was associated with 10-year event-free survival of 64% vs 21%
for MRD positivity (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; 95% Bayesian credi-
ble interval, 0.24-0.33); MRD negativity was also associated
with improved OS (HR, 0.28; 95% Bayesian credible interval,
0.20-0.39).13
No standard therapy has been defined for ALL with detectable
MRD during or after intensive, multiagent chemotherapy.2,10

From 
 Study groups and expert guidelines recommend allogeneic hema-
topoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT).7,15 Patients with persistent
MRD who undergo HSCT have better outcomes compared with
those who do not undergo HSCT.5,8 However, many patients ex-
perience relapse while awaiting HSCT, and detectable MRD pre-
transplantationis associated with ahigher relapserate afterHSCT.16,17
Targeted agents with alternative mechanisms of action may
reduce MRD and delay or prevent hematologic relapse.
Blinatumomab is a bispecific T cell–engager antibody construct
that directs T cells to CD191 cells.18 CD19 is expressed on blast
cells in .95% of cases of B-cell precursor ALL.19 In a randomized
phase 3 trial of patients with Ph-negative relapsed or refractory
B-cell precursor ALL, 44% of 271 patients achieved hematologic
CR with blinatumomab, compared with 25% of 134 patients with
standard-of-care chemotherapy.20 On the basis of a phase 2 pilot
study in MRD-positive ALL with an 80% MRD response rate,21 the
single-arm, open-label study reported here evaluated efficacy

From 
 and tolerability of single-agent blinatumomab in adult patients
with ALL in hematologic CR with MRD $1023. In contrast to the
pilot study,22 the level of MRD had to be higher in our study
($1023 vs $1024), and a relevant proportion of patients with
MRD1 ALL after relapse were included.
Patients and methods
Study design
This open-label, single-arm phase 2 study was conducted at
46 centers in Europe and Russia (supplemental Table 1, available
on the Blood Web site). Patients received blinatumomab 15 mg/m2
per day by continuous IV infusion for up to 4 cycles. Each
cycle comprised 4 weeks of blinatumomab infusion followed by
a 2-week treatment-free period. Patients could undergo HSCT
any time after cycle 1 at the investigator’s discretion. Prophylaxis
for central nervous system ALL was recommended before cycle 1
and after cycles 2 and 4. Corticosteroid pretreatment for pro-
phylaxis of neurologic events and cytokine release syndrome
was required (supplemental Methods B). Guidelines for
supportive care, dose interruption and discontinuation for
adverse events, and blinatumomab retreatment for MRD re-
lapse within 18 months are provided in supplemental Methods
C. Concurrent antileukemic therapy was prohibited.
MRD evaluation (supplemental Figure 1) for eligibility was per-
formed mostly in the central reference laboratory (University of Kiel,
Kiel, Germany) or in national reference laboratories using real-time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction of clonally rearranged im-
munoglobulin and/or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements or using
flow cytometry. The central reference laboratory exclusively per-
formed MRD assessments at baseline, at the end of each treatment
cycle, and during efficacy follow-up using real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction.4 A complete MRD response was de-
fined as no target amplification with a minimum sensitivity of 1024.23
An MRD response was defined as either a complete MRD response
or MRD response, which included patients with complete MRD
response and those with detectable MRD ,1024.
Patients
Eligible patients were age $18 years with B-cell precursor ALL in
first or later hematologic CR and with persistent or recurrent
MRD $1023 after a minimum of 3 blocks of intensive chemotherapy.
Full eligibility criteria are provided in supplemental Methods A.
Study procedures were approved by the investigational review
board at each study center and by independent ethics commit-
tees per local regulations. Patients provided written informed
consent. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov
(#NCT01207388) and EudraCT (#2010-018314-75). This analysis
reflects all patients with a data cutoff date of 5 August 2015,
when all patients had either completed at least 18 months of
follow-up or discontinued the study.
Outcomes
Analysis sets are summarized in supplemental Table 2. For the
analyses, different data sets were defined per protocol. This was
necessary because some patients who were treated in the study
fulfilled the inclusion criteria per local MRD testing, but these
criteria were not confirmed after central review, or they had
Ph1 disease or were not in remission (Figure 1). Reporting of pa-
tient characteristics and safety end points used the intent-to-treat
full analysis set (N 5 116). The primary end point was the rate of
complete MRD response after cycle 1 among patients in the
primary end point full analysis set (n 5 113), which excluded
patients from the full analysis set with either no central MRD
assay results or a test sensitivity that did not reach 1024. Overall
MRD response was evaluated among patients in the primary end
point efficacy set (n 5 103), which excluded in addition patients
from the primary end point full analysis set without hematologic
CR or with MRD #1023 at study entry. Thus, the primary end
point efficacy set represents the originally intended study
population. The key secondary end point, hematologic relapse-
free survival (RFS) at 18 months after initiation of blinatumomab,
was evaluated among patients in the key secondary end point full
analysis set (n 5 110), which excluded patients from the full
analysis set who had either Ph-positive disease or $5% bone
marrow blasts at study entry. For the primary analysis of RFS,
patients were censored at the time of HSCT in continuous CR or at
the time of chemotherapy after blinatumomab to focus on pa-
tients who were not eligible for HSCT. A sensitivity analysis of
RFS not censored at HSCT or chemotherapy was also pre-
specified. All other analyses of secondary end points, such as

From 
 landmark analysis of OS or duration of hematologic remission,
were performed without censoring for HSCT or chemotherapy
after blinatumomab.
Adverse events from the date of informed consent until 30 days
after the last blinatumomab infusion were graded per Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0). For patients
with HSCT within 30 days after the last dose, the final safety follow-
up visit was performed as close as possible before initiation of
transplantation conditioning. Adverse events occurring .30 days
after treatment were recorded only if the investigator considered
the adverse event possibly related to blinatumomab treatment.
Statistical analysis
Complete MRD response rates were calculated using 2-sided
exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all patients and in
subgroups defined by baseline covariates. Kaplan-Meier esti-
mates with 2-sided 95% CIs were used to describe RFS and
OS; differences between subgroups were evaluated using log-
rank test. Transplantation effects on long-term outcomes were
evaluated in a post hoc analysis considering the waiting time for
HSCT. Duration of hematologic remission was estimated by the
1 2 cumulative incidence function of relapse, with death in CR as
a competing event. Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS and RFS were
repeated separately among patients who received .1 cycle
or only 1 cycle of blinatumomab. For all Kaplan-Meier tests,
censoring for HSCT or postblinatumomab chemotherapy was
performed only if specifically stated.
Analysis of the primary and key secondary end points was hi-
erarchical. One hundred evaluable patients would provide 90%
power to demonstrate that a 97.5% 1-sided CI excluded 44% if
the true unknown response rate was 61%.
For the key secondary end point, 100 patients provided 90%
power to show that the lower boundary of the 95% CI for the
Kaplan-Meier RFS rate (with censoring of patients at HSCT)
would exceed 28%, assuming a true hematologic relapse rate at
18 months of 55% and an HSCT availability rate of #67%.
The statistical analysis plan predefined analysis sets that were
based on availability of MRD data and patient population. The
main outcome parameters (patient characteristics and safety)
were analyzed in the intent-to-treat full analysis set (N 5 116);
the primary end point was analyzed in the primary end point
full analysis set (n 5 113); the secondary end points (OS, RFS,
and duration of hematologic remission) were analyzed in the
secondary end point full analysis set (n 5 110). Overall MRD
response was evaluated in the primary end point efficacy set
(n 5 103). Additional details on the definition and compo-
sition of data sets are given in Figure 1 and supplemental
Table 2.
RFS, OS, and duration of hematologic remission were also cal-
culated in landmark analyses beginning at day 45 for patients with
or without a complete MRD response within cycle 1. Day 45 was
selected for these analyses because it was the end of cycle 1,
when the last MRD assessment was performed. RFS was de-
fined as time from first blinatumomab dose to the earlier of first
detection of hematologic/extramedullary relapse, secondary
leukemia, death (resulting from any cause), or, if applicable, last date
of continuous CR.

From 
 Role of the funding source
The trial was designed by Amgen Research (Munich), GmbH
(formerly Micromet AG), in collaboration with the trial investigators.
The first author prepared the first draft of the manuscript, with
assistance from professional medical writers who were funded
by Amgen. All authors had access to the data and provided
contributions to subsequent drafts of the manuscript. All authors
vouch for the integrity and completeness of the data and for the
fidelity of the trial to the protocol. Statisticians employed by
Amgen conducted the statistical analyses and contributed to the
manuscript. An independent data and safety monitoring board
met regularly to review safety and efficacy data to provide
recommendations for safety oversight and protection of the
scientific integrity of the study.
Results
Patient characteristics
The full analysis set for patient characteristics included 116
patients who received at least 1 blinatumomab infusion between
November 2010 and February 2014 (Figure 1). Median age was
45 years (range, 18-76 years). Forty-seven percent of patients
were enrolled with MRD $1022, and 35% were in second or later
hematologic CR (Table 1). All patients completed the treatment
period (Figure 1). Overall, 76 patients underwent HSCT in
continuous CR after 1 (n 5 27), 2 (n 5 36), or 3 to 4 cycles (n 5 13;
Figure 1). Treatment cycles, interruptions, and withdrawals are
summarized in supplemental Results A.
Primary end point: MRD response
The primary end point full analysis set for analysis of a complete
MRD response included 113 patients with evaluable MRD
markers (supplemental Table 2). Of these patients, 88 (78%)
achieved a complete MRD response after cycle 1. The lower
bound of the 95% CI (69% to 85%) was .44%, confirming the
study hypothesis. Two additional patients achieved a complete
MRD response after cycle 2; no additional patient achieved
a complete MRD response after cycle 3 or cycle 4. Among 5
patients with Ph1 disease who had MRD evaluations, 3 (60%)
had an MRD response during cycle 1.
The primary end point efficacy set for analysis of overall MRD
included 103 patients in hematologic CR and with MRD .1023
at baseline. Of these patients, 91 (88%) achieved any MRD re-
sponse, including 82 (80%; 95% CI, 71% to 87%) with a complete
MRD response after cycle 1. Complete MRD response rates were
similar between patients with MRD $1022 and those with MRD
,1022 at baseline and between patients with first remission and

From 
 those with later remission at baseline (Figure 2). Of 45 patients
in this analysis set with treatment interruptions as a result of
any cause during cycle 1, 37 (82%) achieved a complete MRD
response.
Secondary efficacy end points: survival
and transplantation
The key secondary end point full analysis set included 110
patients from the full analysis set who had Ph2 disease and ,5%
blasts at baseline. Among these patients, the Kaplan-Meier
estimate for RFS at 18 months was 54% (95% CI, 33% to 70%),
exceeding the prespecified boundary of 28% and thereby
meeting the key secondary end point. Estimates of RFS at
18 months were similar with or without censoring for post-
blinatumomab HSCT and chemotherapy. Median RFS was
18.9 months (95% CI, 12.3-35.2 months), with a median follow-up
of 29.9 months (Figure 3A). Median RFS was 11.0 vs 24.6 months
among patients treated within later CR vs first CR (unadjusted
HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.26-3.48; P 5 .004; Figure 3B). Patients in first
CR also had improved OS compared with those in later CR
(supplemental Figure 2). The impact of other baseline covariates
on OS, RFS, and duration of hematologic remission is summa-
rized in supplemental Table 3.
Forty-eight of 110 patients remained in CR (36 after subsequent
HSCT), 38 experienced relapse in CR, and 24 died in CR (20 after
subsequent HSCT). Median duration of hematologic remis-
sion was not reached (supplemental Figure 3). Median OS was
36.5 months (95% CI, 19.8 months to not estimable), with a
median follow-up of 30.0 months (Figure 3C). Among the entire
study population of 116 patients, median OS was 36.5 months
(95% CI, 19.2 months to not estimable; supplemental Figure 4).
Landmark analyses of RFS and OS by complete MRD response
excluded 3 patients without MRD results (n 5 1) or insufficient
sensitivity of the assay (n 5 2). The landmark of 45 days was used to
represent the latest day of first MRD response assessment. Median
RFS was 23.6 vs 5.7 months (P 5 .002) and median OS was 38.9 vs
12.5 months (P 5 .002) in patients with and without a complete
MRD response in cycle 1, respectively (Table 2; Figure 3D). Median
RFS was 13.9 months among patients in second or later CR who
achieved a complete MRD response with blinatumomab; median
RFS was not reached among patients in first CR who achieved a
complete MRD response with blinatumomab (Figure 3E).
Seventy-four (67%) of 110 patients in the key secondary end
point full analysis set underwent HSCT in continuous remission
after blinatumomab: 55 in ongoing first CR and 19 in continuous
second CR. Of the patients undergoing transplantation, 65%
were age .35 years, and median age was 42.5 years (range,
18-67 years). Nine (25%) of 36 patients without HSCT or chemo-
therapy after blinatumomab remained in continuous CR, with a
median follow-up of 24.0 months (range, 2.8-41.6 months),
whereas 36 (49%) of 74 patients with HSCT remained in remission.
Characteristics of patients who underwent postblinatumomab
HSCT and a post hoc analysis of survival outcomes are sum-
marized in supplemental Results B.
Adverse events
All 116 patients who started cycle 1 experienced at least 1
adverse event (supplemental Table 4). During cycles 2, 3, and 4,
85%, 79%, and 75% of treated patients, respectively, expe-
rienced adverse events. Overall, 33% and 27% of patients had
grade 3 and 4 adverse events, respectively (Table 3), in-
cluding 20% and 18%, respectively, in cycle 1 and 11% each in
cycle 2. Investigators considered grade 3 and 4 adverse
events to be treatment related for 29% and 22% of patients,
respectively. Four patients (3%) had cytokine release syn-
drome (grade 1, n 5 2; grade 3, n 5 2), all during cycle 1
(supplemental Table 4).
Sixty-one patients (53%) had neurologic events of any grade
(Table 3), with decreasing incidence over cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 of
47%, 24%, 15%, and 15%, respectively. Median duration from
onset to resolution was 4 days (quartile 1, 2 days; quartile 3, 8
days). Twelve (10%) and 3 patients (3%) had grade 3 and
4 neurologic events, respectively, with 9%, 4%, 0%, and 0%
reporting grade 3 and 4 events for cycles 1, 2, 3, and
4, respectively. Neurologic events resolved in 59 patients
(97%) with any-grade events and in all patients with

 grade 3/4 events. Most patients who had grade 3/4 neurologic
events resumed blinatumomab treatment after the event
resolved.
Two fatal adverse events were reported during the treatment
period (both in cycle 1): atypical pneumonitis with H1N1 in-
fluenza (considered treatment related by the investigator) and
subdural hemorrhage (considered unrelated to treatment by the
investigator). Investigators reported 4 fatal adverse events
after blinatumomab treatment, including 2 in patients who un-
derwent HSCT after blinatumomab (multifocal central nervous
system lesions and graft-versus-host disease at 124 and 136 days
posttreatment, respectively) and 2 (disease progression and
multiorgan failure at 154 and 359 days posttreatment, re-
spectively) after subsequent relapse in patients not under-
going transplantation.
Discussion
To date, most investigational therapies in ALL have been eval-
uated in patients with overt relapse. This was the first international,
multicenter study in ALL to combine MRD-based inclusion criteria
with an MRD-based primary end point assessed per the central
reference laboratory. This patient group was selected based on
poor prognosis as a result of a high relapse rate with continued
chemotherapy, indicating resistance to chemotherapy. A targeted
therapy with an alternative mechanism of action administered
before overt relapse may improve the outcome in these patients.
The results confirm and extend those of the pilot study of
blinatumomab in MRD1 ALL, in which 80% of patients
achieved an MRD response.21,22 However, in contrast to the
pilot study, this study enrolled patients with MRD $1023 (vs
$1024) and included patients in second or later CR, both
indicators of increased risk. Nevertheless, across all groups
evaluated, complete MRD response rates were high, and no
demographic/clinical characteristics were associated with
MRD response after 1 cycle. In relapsed/refractory ALL, the
only baseline feature that was predictive of response to
blinatumomab was blast percentage, with a 73% composite CR
or CR with partial hematologic recovery rate in patients with
,50% blasts in bone marrow.24 This finding and the high re-
sponse rates in MRD1 patients support the hypothesis that
targeted single-drug immunotherapy has impressive antileu-
kemic activity and that lower leukemia burden is a favorable
prerequisite for this treatment principle.
Previous studies evaluating outcomes in adult patients with
MRD1 ALL after conventional chemotherapy showed that
MRD1 status was associated with shorter OS and RFS,5-7,16,25 and
higher MRD burden was associated with shorter duration of
hematologic remission and poorer outcomes despite continued
chemotherapy.4 In this study, landmark analyses showed that
achieving a complete MRD response was associated with
prolonged OS and RFS compared with not achieving an MRD
response, demonstrating a direct patient benefit for the
immunotherapeutic conversion of MRD1 to MRD2 disease. Al-
though MRD response rates were high in patients treated
in second or third CR, RFS, OS, and duration of hematologic
remission were inferior compared with patients treated in
first CR. MRD response may have different implications
in relapsed/refractory ALL, presumably due to genetic
instability and selection of more aggressive subclones,
which are correlated to higher incidences of escape and
resistance mechanisms.26 Thus, treatment with blinatumo-
mab in MRD1 disease during an ongoing first CR may be
beneficial.
In contrast to stepwise dosing of blinatumomab to prevent
cytokine release syndrome in the relapsed/refractory setting
(9 mg per day for 1 week followed by 28 mg per day for 3 weeks
in cycle 1),24 we used a fixed blinatumomab dose of 15 mg/m2
per day 3 28 days per cycle, corresponding to the fixed target
dose of 28 mg per day for relapsed/refractory ALL. Despite
implementation of a higher starting dose in this study, cytopenias,
including those of grade 3/4, were less frequent compared with
previous blinatumomab studies in relapsed/refractory ALL.18,22,24
The incidence of adverse events (including neurologic events)
was greatest during cycle 1 and decreased over subsequent
cycles. Neurologic events were mostly grade 1/2 and included
tremor, aphasia, dizziness, encephalopathy, and seizure, with
grade 1/2 tremor and aphasia occurring more frequently than
in relapsed/refractory ALL.18,24 For those patients with adverse
events leading to treatment interruptions, most events resolved
rapidly after stopping blinatumomab, which has a serum half-life
of ;2 hours. Most patients who had grade 3/4 neurologic events
resumed blinatumomab treatment after the event resolved.
Similar neurologic events have been observed with other CD19-
directed therapies,27-29 in other T cell–activating studies,30 and
in blinatumomab studies in relapsed/refractory ALL and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma.18,22,24 The pathogenesis of neurologic
events is poorly understood and does not seem to be correlated
to tumor burden, because rates of grade 3/4 neurologic events
were similar for blinatumomab in relapsed/refractory ALL.24
In the MRD setting, adverse events associated with cytokine
release syndrome were observed infrequently (n 5 4), and
no deaths were related to neurologic events or cytokine release
syndrome.
A median OS of 36.5 months, and an equivalent estimate for
patients treated in first CR in this study, compares favorably to
that in published data for MRD-positive ALL5 and relapsed/
refractory ALL.24 In this study, a median RFS of 18.9 months
without censoring for HSCT was substantially greater than the
median time to hematologic relapse of 7.6 months previously
reported for patients in first CR with MRD .1024 who did not
undergo HSCT,5 suggesting that blinatumomab has the po-
tential to improve the outcome of patients with chemotherapy-
resistant disease. HSCT rates of 47% to 66% among patients with
B-cell precursor ALL with MRD after standard frontline therapy
have led to prolonged RFS.5,11 On the basis of these results,
investigators offered HSCT in 67% of the patients in this study in
remission after blinatumomab, because this became standard
practice for MRD-positive patients in the countries participating
in the trial. Because of changing practices, the proportion of
patients undergoing HSCT was higher than expected. HSCT was
also offered to older patients (65% age .35 years), and 34% of
the transplantations used mismatched donors. This broad in-
dication for HSCT may have contributed to transplantation-
related mortality; nevertheless, mortality is in line with reports
of HSCT in standard of care ranging between 20% to 30%.31-35
The proportion of patients not undergoing transplantation
was small, and the study was neither planned nor powered to
assess the impact of HSCT after blinatumomab treatment.

From 
 Nevertheless, a number of patients with a complete MRD re-
sponse remained in long-term remission without subsequent
HSCT, which confirms the experience of the pilot study with
long-term survivors without subsequent HSCT.21,22 This obser-
vation might be of relevance for the development of future
treatment strategies, particularly for less fit and elderly patients.
Additional studies need to determine the role of HSCT in this
setting, particularly regarding indications for HSCT.
Treatment of patients with persistent chemotherapy-resistant
disease after conventional treatment remains a major chal-
lenge in the management of pediatric and adult ALL, with high
relapse rates during continued chemotherapy and even after
subsequent HSCT. Among patients with chemotherapy-resistant
MRD, targeted immunotherapy with blinatumomab resulted in a
substantial molecular response rate and improved long-term
outcomes among responders compared with nonresponders.
Our results suggest that targeted treatment in early stages of
MRD is a viable therapeutic strategy for patients with B-cell
precursor ALL and that it should also be evaluated in other
hematologic malignancies.36,37
