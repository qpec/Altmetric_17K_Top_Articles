ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND The United States is battling obesity and heart failure (HF) epidemics. Although studies have suggested
relationships between obesity and HF morbidity, little is known regarding the effects of substantial weight reduction in
obese patients with HF.
OBJECTIVES This study investigated whether bariatric surgery is associated with a decreased rate of HF exacerbation.
METHODS We performed a self-controlled case series study of obese patients with HF who underwent bariatric surgery,
using the population-based emergency department (ED) and inpatient sample in California, Florida, and Nebraska.
Primary outcome was ED visit or hospitalization for HF exacerbation from 2005 to 2011. We used conditional logistic
regression to compare the outcome event rate during sequential 12-month periods, using pre-surgery months 13 to 24 as
the reference period.
RESULTS We identified 524 patients with HF who underwent bariatric surgery. During the reference period, 16.2% of
patients had an ED visit or hospitalization for HF exacerbation. The rate remained unchanged in the subsequent 12-month
pre-surgery period (15.3%; p ¼ 0.67). In the first 12-month period after bariatric surgery, we observed a nonsignificantly
reduced rate (12.0%; p ¼ 0.052). However, the rate was significantly lower in the subsequent 13 to 24 months after
bariatric surgery (9.9%; adjusted odds ratio: 0.57; p ¼ 0.003). By contrast, there was no significant reduction in the rate
of HF exacerbation among obese patients who underwent nonbariatric surgery (i.e., cholecystectomy, hysterectomy).
CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that bariatric surgery is associated with a decline in the rate of HF exacerbation
requiring ED evaluation or hospitalization among obese patients with HF. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2016;67:895–903)

 H
eart failure (HF) is a significant
public health burden that affects
approximately 5.7 million adults
in the United States (1); the total number of
patients is projected to increase by 46%
from 2012 to 2030 (2). HF exacerbations
contribute to a substantial proportion of the
burden, accounting for 676,000 emergency
department (ED) visits and 1.02 million hos-
pitalizations annually (1). The total (direct
and indirect) cost for treating patients with
HF,
within
which
the
majority
(80%)
is
related to hospitalizations, was $30.7 billion
in 2012 and is projected to increase to $69.8
billion in 2030 in the United States (2).
In parallel, the United States also has
experienced an obesity epidemic (3). Ap-
proximately 40% of patients hospitalized for
HF exacerbation are obese (4), and studies
have demonstrated an association between
obesity
and
HF-related
morbidity.
For
example, epidemiological studies report a “dose–ef-
fect” relationship between body mass index (BMI)
and rates of hospitalization for HF exacerbation in
patients with obesity, suggesting possible causality
(5–7).
Additionally,
potential
pathophysiological
mechanisms exist that link obesity to HF exacerba-
tion (e.g., excessive accumulation of adipose tissue
leads to hemodynamic changes that may result in
alterations in cardiac performance and left ventricu-
lar (LV) morphology) (8–10). Therefore, obesity is
recognized as a possible risk factor for HF exacerba-
tion (8). Substantial weight loss, on the other hand,
has been associated with reversal of several hemo-
dynamic abnormalities and adverse LV remodeling
among patients with obesity and HF (8,9). However,
little is known about whether substantial weight loss
results in a decreased rate of HF-related adverse
events (11). Bariatric surgery is the most effective
method to achieve substantial weight loss (12) and
can theoretically lead to improved HF control among
patients with obesity.
In this context, we aimed to investigate whether
bariatric surgery, used as an instrument to achieve
significant weight loss, is associated with signifi-
cantly reduced rates of ED visits and hospitalizations
for HF exacerbation among obese patients with HF.
METHODS
STUDY
DESIGN
AND
SETTING. We
performed
a
self-controlled
case
series
study
utilizing
the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State
Emergency Department Database (SEDD) (13) and
State Inpatient Database (SID) (14). The study was
designed to perform intraperson comparisons among
those who experienced both the exposure and the
outcome. No separate control group was necessary
because this study design allows each person to
function as his or her own control (15). The major
advantage of this design is that both measured and
unmeasured confounders are controlled as long as
they do not change over time during the study period
(15). Because the exposure of this study (i.e., bariatric
surgery) is transient and discrete, and the outcome is
characterized as a short-term event, the present study
meets the required assumptions of self-controlled
study designs (15). We assessed the rate of ED visits
or hospitalizations for HF exacerbation for 4 consec-
utive years: 2 years before and 2 years after bariatric
surgery.
The data were extracted from HCUP SEDD and SID
in California, Florida, and Nebraska from 2005 to
2011. HCUP includes all-payer, encounter-level in-
formation and is the largest longitudinal hospital care
data collection available in the United States. The
SEDD is a database from short-term, acute-care,
nonfederal
hospitals
in
participating
states
that
encompasses all ED visits, including treat-and-release
encounters
and
transfers.
The
SID
captures
all
inpatient
discharges
from
short-term,
acute-care,
nonfederal, general, and other specialty hospitals,
and this database includes those admitted through
the ED. Taken together, all ED visits regardless of
disposition and all hospitalizations regardless of the
source of admission were able to be identified. The
3 states were chosen as their data included unique
encrypted patient identifiers, making it possible to
perform longitudinal follow-up of specific patients
across years, and for their high data quality. Details of
the study design, databases, and statistical analysis
methods have been previously published (13,14,16).

General Hospital waived review of this study.
STUDY POPULATION. Steps were taken to identify all
obese patients with HF who underwent bariatric
surgery in the databases from the 3 states. First,
patients age $18 years with at least 1 ED visit or
hospitalization for HF exacerbation between January
1, 2005, and December 31, 2011, were identified using
the
International
Classification
of
Diseases-Ninth
Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis
codes for HF (402.01, 402.11, 402.91, 404.01, 404.03,
404.11, 404.13, 404.91, 404.93, and 428.0) in the
primary diagnosis field (17). Second, among patients

 who had either an ED visit or hospitalization for HF,
patients hospitalized for bariatric surgery with a
concurrent diagnosis of obesity were identified. Cur-
rent Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes used for
bariatric surgery were 43.89, 44.31, 44.38, 44.39,
44.50, 44.68, 44.69, 44.93, 44.95, 44.99, 45.51, and
45.90; the ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes for obesity
were 278.0 to 278.2, V77.8, V85.3x, and V85.4 (16,18).
Patients with diagnostic codes for cancer (150.0 to
159.9) were excluded. The data of patients who
underwent
bariatric
surgery
between
January
1,
2007, and December 31, 2009, were collected to
accommodate
the
2-year
pre-surgery
and
2-year
post-surgery
periods.
Patients
excluded
were
out-of-state residents; patients who died during the
index hospitalization for bariatric surgery or died
in-hospital during the 2-year post-surgery period; and
patients with multiple bariatric surgeries during the
study period.
To address potential loss to follow-up (e.g., out-of-
hospital deaths, moving out of state), we limited the
patient population to those who had at least 1 health
care utilization for any reason during post-surgery
months 25 to 36. Our population selection method
ensured that these patients were alive and living
within the study states until at least 2 years post-
surgery.
MEASUREMENTS
AND
OUTCOMES. The
databases
recorded demographics (age, sex, and race/ethnicity),
primary
insurance
type,
estimated
household
income, ICD-9-CM diagnosis, and procedures. SEDD
also collected data on ED disposition. We determined
baseline patient characteristics at the time of hospi-
talization for bariatric surgery. Primary insurance
types
were
categorized
into
Medicaid,
Medicare,
private sources, and other. Race/ethnicity was cate-
gorized into non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic, and other.
The primary outcome was a composite of ED visit
or hospitalization for HF exacerbation. The secondary
outcomes were an ED visit with HF exacerbation and
hospitalization with HF exacerbation as assessed
separately.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. To compare each patient’s
rate of outcomes with pre-surgery days 366 to 730 as
the reference period, a conditional logistic regression
model was fit to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for
pre-surgery days 1 to 365, post-surgery days 0 to 365,
and post-surgery days 366 to 730. Each patient was
matched to his/her own reference period. The 1-year
intervals used in the regression model accounted for
potential seasonal variations that may affect the rate
of HF exacerbation (19).
We performed several sensitivity analyses using
different statistical assumptions and patient pop-
ulations to assess the robustness of our inferences.
First,
we
repeated
the
analysis
without
limiting
patients to those who had any health care utilization
during the 25 to 36 months post-surgery. Second, the
frequency of HF exacerbations was modeled as a
count variable as opposed to a binary outcome by
using a negative binomial regression model. Third, to
address the possibility of misdiagnosis after bariatric
surgery, we repeated the analysis with a composite
endpoint of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
pneumonia, or dyspnea as the primary diagnosis
(ICD-9-CM codes 491.xx, 492.xx, and 496.xx for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 486.xx for
pneumonia; and 786.0x for dyspnea). We selected
these outcomes because these disease conditions
can mimic signs and symptoms of HF exacerbation
but have no known biological rationale to be modified
by bariatric surgery. Fourth, to determine whether
reduction in the rate of HF exacerbation was associ-
ated with any elective abdominal surgery in general
rather
than
bariatric
surgery
itself
(e.g.,
due
to
intensified HF control during the perisurgical period),
the analysis was repeated using 2 populations who
underwent an elective nonbariatric surgery: chole-
cystectomy (CPT codes 51.21 to 51.24 and 51.41 to
51.59) and hysterectomy (CPT codes 68.31 to 68.79
and 68.9). We chose these 2 surgeries because of their
large sample size, similar characteristics (both are
elective
abdominal
surgeries),
and
absence
of
biological plausibility to affect the rate of HF exac-
erbation (16). Lastly, because our study population
was relatively young, we stratified the analysis by age
group
to
address
the
possibility
of
differential
effects of bariatric surgery by age. All analyses were
performed with SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary,
North Carolina). Results are displayed with 95%
confidence interval (CI) when appropriate, and a
2-sided p value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
All obese adults with HF who underwent bariatric
surgery between January 1, 2007, and December 31,
2009, were identified (N ¼ 1,792). Eighty-three pa-
tients who underwent multiple bariatric surgeries
and 48 patients who died in-hospital during the post-
surgery period were excluded (3 patients had both),
leaving a total of 1,664 patients. In this population,
our final sample for the primary analysis consisted of
524 patients who had at least 1 ED visit or hospitali-
zation during 25 to 36 months after bariatric surgery.

 Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the
enrolled patients. The median age of patients was
49 years, and 69.8% were women.
The Central Illustration depicts the rate of ED visits
or hospitalizations for HF exacerbation during the
pre- and post-surgery periods by 6-month intervals.
In the reference period (i.e., 13 to 24 months before
bariatric surgery), 16.2% (95% CI: 13.1% to 19.4%) of
patients had at least 1 ED visit or hospitalization for
HF exacerbation (Table 2). In the subsequent period
of 1 to 12 months before surgery, the rate did not
materially change (15.3%; 95% CI: 12.2% to 18.4%),
with a corresponding adjusted OR of 0.93 (95% CI:
0.67 to 1.30; p ¼ 0.67). By contrast, there was a
nonsignificantly reduced rate of ED visits or hospi-
talizations for HF exacerbation occurring within 12
months post-bariatric surgery (12.0%; 95% CI: 9.2% to
14.8%), corresponding to an adjusted OR of 0.71
(95% CI: 0.50 to 1.00; p ¼ 0.052). In the subsequent
period of 13 to 24 months after bariatric surgery, the
rate was significantly lower (9.9%; 95% CI: 7.4%
to 12.5%), corresponding to an adjusted OR of 0.57
(95% CI: 0.39 to 0.82; p ¼ 0.003). In the analysis of
secondary outcomes, the rate of HF exacerbation
after bariatric surgery declined for the 2 component
events individually in 2 years: ED visit and hospital-
ization (Table 2).
In the sensitivity analysis, without limiting the
patient population to those with any health care uti-
lization during 25 to 36 months after bariatric surgery
(n ¼ 1,664), the results did not change materially, but
had a greater statistical significance (Online Table 1).
Similarly, the temporal pattern in the rate of HF
exacerbation persisted with modeling the outcome as
a count variable (Table 3). By contrast, the rate of ED
visits or hospitalizations with a non-HF diagnosis
(chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia,
or dyspnea) did not change before and after bariatric
surgery (Table 4). Additionally, in separate self-
controlled
case
series
analyses
using
the
obese
adults
with
HF who underwent cholecystectomy
(n ¼ 2,240) or hysterectomy (n ¼ 851), the rate of ED
visits or hospitalizations for HF exacerbation either
increased or did not change significantly after these
nonbariatric surgeries (Table 5). The rate reduction
after bariatric surgery was consistent across the age
strata (Online Table 2).
DISCUSSION
PRINCIPAL
FINDINGS
AND
CONTEXT. This
self-
controlled case series study using the largest dataset
of patients with HF who underwent bariatric surgery
showed that the rate of ED visits or hospitalizations
for HF exacerbation was reduced by 40% after bar-
iatric surgery (Central Illustration). A major strength of
this study is that each patient functioned as a control
for
him/herself,
effectively
controlling
for
both
measured and unmeasured confounders. The ob-
served decrease in the rate of HF exacerbation was
substantial and consistent across different statistical
assumptions. The rate of ED visit and hospitalization
for other diseases that can mimic HF exacerbation
remained stable after bariatric surgery, limiting the
possibility of misdiagnosing HF exacerbations as
non-HF events post-surgery. We also addressed the
possibility that the reduction in the rate of HF exac-
erbation was related to intensified HF management
during the perisurgical period by demonstrating that
nonbariatric surgeries had no favorable impact on the
rate of HF exacerbation.
The evidence regarding the effectiveness of weight
reduction on HF-related symptoms and health care
utilization
is
scarce.
A
few
small,
single-center
retrospective studies showed improvement in some
clinical endpoints (11,20–22). Of these, the best evi-
dence comes from a retrospective chart review study

 (n ¼ 22). This study reported that morbidly obese
patients with HF who underwent bariatric surgery
had a lower rate of hospital readmission at 1 year and
improvement in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and New
York Heart Association functional class compared
with matched controls (11). Our rigorously designed
study with a much larger sample size (n ¼ 524) and
longer follow-up period corroborated these findings
and extended prior research by demonstrating the
robustness of the observed benefit in a real-world
setting.
OBESITY PARADOX AND MORTALITY DATA AFTER
BARIATRIC SURGERY. There is emerging evidence of
an “obesity paradox” in patients with chronic HF
wherein mild-to-moderate obesity is associated with
improved survival (23,24). However, no study has
reported increased mortality or HF morbidity with
weight reduction interventions in morbidly obese
patients. Indeed, in a retrospective cohort study of
moderately to severely obese patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus, the 2,580 patients who underwent
bariatric surgery showed reduced mortality compared
with nonbariatric control patients (1.6% vs. 7.5% with
a median follow-up period of 20 months) (25). Hence,
current American, Canadian, and European guide-
lines recommend weight reduction in this population.
Bariatric surgery is known to have low post-operative
mortality: 0.05% to 0.1% at 30 days (26), 0.38% to

Obesity has been linked to HF exacerbations; however, it is unknown whether substantial weight loss lowers the rate of HF exacerbations. The present
study analyzed 524 patients to investigate whether bariatric surgery is associated with decreased rate of HF exacerbation. This graph shows the proportion
of patients who had an ED visit or hospitalization for HF exacerbation before and after surgery. The rate declined significantly after bariatric surgery in 2
years. This study provides the best evidence on the effectiveness of bariatric surgery on HF morbidity, and will prompt further investigation into the
underlying mechanisms and optimal weight management strategies for obese patients with HF. ED ¼ emergency department; HF ¼ heart failure.

 0.6% at 1 year (27), and 2.5% with 8 to 14 years of
follow-up, which was lower than that in an age-, sex-,
and race/ethnicity-matched general population (28).
Additionally, the mortality rates after bariatric sur-
gery are comparable to those after nonbariatric sur-
geries such as cholecystectomy (0.5% at 30 days [29]
and 1.0% at 1 year [30]), and hysterectomy (0.7% at 30
days [31] and 1.8% at 3 years [32]). However, it should
also be noted that previous studies consistently
reported that HF is associated with a 5- to 10-fold
increase in post-operative mortality (26,27,33,34).
Findings from the present study add to the body of
knowledge by indicating that bariatric surgery for
patients with obesity and HF may offer additional
benefit by reducing the rate of HF exacerbation.
STRENGTHS
OF
THE
STUDY
DESIGN. To
further
investigate
the
effectiveness
of
bariatric
surgery
on HF-related clinical outcomes such as exercise
capacity and mortality, a high-quality randomized
controlled trial involving obese patients who are at
high risk of developing HF exacerbation would be
necessary. However, such a trial may pose significant
financial and logistical challenges (35). Furthermore,
patients enrolled in randomized controlled trials may
be different or behave differently from the general
population in the real world, thereby undermining
external
validity
(generalizability)
of
such
trials
(36,37). By contrast, our population-based cohort
of patients receiving care in the natural setting
enhanced the external validity of the findings. The
self-controlled
case
series
study
design
also
augmented
the
internal
validity
of
our
findings
because it effectively eliminated interpersonal varia-
tions and allowed for more precise assessment of
exposure effects. Moreover, because each patient
served as a control for him/herself, this study design
controlled
for
all
time-invariant
confounders,
addressing the influence of residual confounding
inherent in traditional case-control or other observa-
tional study designs.
ACCURACY OF EXPOSURE AND OUTCOMEIDENTIFICATION.
As
with
any
studies
using
administrative
data,
misclassification of the exposure and outcome is
possible. With regard to obesity, the specificity of
ICD-9-CM coding for obesity was reported to be 99.4%
(95% CI: 98.7% to 99.8%), which essentially excluded
patients without obesity from the present study (38).
With regard to the outcome, patients with morbid
obesity can develop dyspnea due to non-HF causes,
such as restrictive lung disease and deconditioning.
Such non-HF events could also be coded as HF
because of concomitant lower extremity edema due
to venous insufficiency. However, physical examina-
tion findings of HF (e.g., jugular venous distention
and crackles in the lungs) may be more difficult to
detect and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concen-
trations are known to be falsely low (39,40) in
morbidly obese patients presenting with HF exacer-
bation. Both of these factors would have led to more
frequent detection of HF after bariatric surgery,
thereby biasing the results towards the null. It has
been shown that the algorithms and definitions to
identify HF using administrative data perform well,
particularly when using a primary hospital discharge
diagnosis (18,41). A systematic review of more than 30
studies reported that these ICD-9-CM codes for HF
had a high specificity and positive predictive value,
with most reporting values >95% (41). Most of these
studies used the Framingham Heart Study criteria,
whereas others utilized the Carlson and National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey criteria for

 validation (41). Additionally, our sensitivity analysis
addressed, at least partially, possible differential
misclassification by demonstrating unchanged rates
of ED visit and hospitalization for non-HF conditions
(i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneu-
monia, or dyspnea) after surgery. Therefore, it would
be unlikely that more HF events were misclassified as
non-HF conditions that can cause dyspnea preferen-
tially after bariatric surgery.
POTENTIAL MECHANISMS LINKING OBESITY AND
HF. A large body of evidence supports an important
role for obesity in HF-related morbidity. Indeed,
several
epidemiological
studies
reported
strong
associations between obesity and HF exacerbation,
and displayed a dose–response relationship between
BMI and the rate of hospitalizations for HF exacer-
bation in obese patients (5–7). There are also plausible
pathophysiological
links
between
obesity
and
HF-related
morbidity.
Prior
research
has
linked
obesity with increased cardiac output; LV hypertro-
phy and diastolic dysfunction; right heart failure
through LV dysfunction or sleep apnea; and neuro-
hormonal and metabolic abnormalities, such as acti-
vation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and
sympathetic nervous system or hyperinsulinemia,
hyperleptinemia, and lipotoxicity, in patients with
HF (8,10).
If a causal relationship exists between obesity and
HF-related morbidity, weight loss can theoretically
reduce the rate of HF exacerbation. Physiological
studies using human models have indicated that a
substantial weight loss can reverse some of these
obesity–HF links (8,9). Furthermore, in the present
study, bariatric surgery was associated with a large
and sustained decline in the rate of HF exacerbation.
Taken together, these data lend significant support to
the concept that substantial weight reduction can
reverse the obesity–HF morbidity link.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. First, our study did not have
information on body weight reduction. However, it is
well documented in the literature that bariatric sur-
gery leads to a substantial, rapid, and sustained
weight loss (42). For instance, after a Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass surgery, a prompt weight loss occurs
within a few months and persists for the next 12 to 18
months in patients with obesity. The mean weight
loss was 35%, corresponding to approximately 70%
reduction of excess weight (42). These data support

 bariatric surgery being used as an instrument for
substantial weight loss. Additionally, the expected
weight reduction after bariatric surgery reported in
the literature was paralleled by the decline in the rate
of HF exacerbation observed in our study. Second,
we did not have data on LVEF. However, in our
database, 184 HF events were coded as either systolic
(43%) or diastolic HF (57%). This is consistent with
another study of morbidly obese patients with HF;
40% had HF with reduced LVEF (43). Third, our
datasets did not capture data on BNP. However,
obese patients are known to have falsely low BNP
(39,40), which undermines the value of baseline BNP
measurement in our target population. Moreover,
BNP values after bariatric surgery might be affected
by
the
change
in
the
patient’s
weight,
further
limiting the value of BNP data in this population
of interest. Finally, the probability of bariatric sur-
gery (the exposure) may not be independent from a
prior
HF
exacerbation
event
(the
outcome).
For
example, an episode of HF exacerbation during the
pre-surgical period might have lowered the proba-
bility of undergoing bariatric surgery. However, this
possibility would have created an upward bias in
the post-surgical period, thereby pulling the results
towards the null (15,44).
CONCLUSIONS
Using
a
large
real-world
population
and
a
self-
controlled case series study design, we found that
bariatric surgery was associated with a significant
reduction in the rate of ED visits and hospitalizations
for HF exacerbation in obese adults with HF. Sup-
ported by prior studies demonstrating links between
obesity and HF exacerbation, the present study pro-
vided the best evidence on the effectiveness of sub-
stantial weight loss on HF morbidity. Because a large
proportion of obese patients with HF would not un-
dergo bariatric surgery for various reasons, including
initial high cost and risk of perisurgical complica-
tions, the present study also stressed the importance
of
developing
effective
nonsurgical
interventions
that
achieve
a
substantial
and
sustained
weight
reduction. Research for establishing such methods
should progress hand-in-hand with extensive public
health programs to prevent development of obesity to
begin with, which will, in turn, benefit many obese
patients with HF.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND
PROCEDURAL SKILLS: In patients with obesity,
bariatric surgery was associated with a lower
likelihood of emergency department visits or hospi-
talizations for HF exacerbation within 2 years
post-operatively.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Additional investi-
gation is needed to identify the mechanism by which
bariatric surgery reduces the risk of HF exacerbations.
