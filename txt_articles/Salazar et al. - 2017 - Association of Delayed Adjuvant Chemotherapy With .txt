IMPORTANCE Adjuvant chemotherapy offers a survival benefit to a number of staging
scenarios in non–small-cell lung cancer. Variable recovery from lung cancer surgery may delay
a patient’
s ability to tolerate adjuvant chemotherapy, yet the urgency of chemotherapy
initiation is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To assess differences in survival according to the time interval between
non–small-cell lung cancer resection and the initiation of postoperative chemotherapy to
determine the association between adjuvant treatment timing and efficacy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective observational study examined
treatment-naive patients with completely resected non–small-cell lung cancer who received
postoperative multiagent chemotherapy between 18 and 127 days after resection between
January 2004 and December 2012. The study population was limited to patients with lymph
node metastases, tumors 4 cm or larger, or local extension. Patients were identified from the
National Cancer Database, a hospital-based tumor registry that captures more than 70% of
incident lung cancer cases in the United States. The association between time to initiation of
adjuvant chemotherapy and survival was evaluated using Cox models with restricted cubic
splines.
EXPOSURES Adjuvant chemotherapy administered at different time points after surgery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy according to time
to initiation after surgery.
RESULTS A total of 12 473 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [57-70] years) were
identified: 3073 patients (25%) with stage I disease; 5981 patients (48%), stage II; and 3419
patients (27%), stage III. A Cox model with restricted cubic splines identified the lowest
mortality risk when chemotherapy was started 50 days postoperatively (95% CI, 39-56 days).
Initiation of chemotherapy after this interval (57-127 days; ie, the later cohort) did not
increase mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.037; 95% CI, 0.972-1.105; P = .27). Furthermore, in a
Cox model of 3976 propensity-matched pairs, patients who received chemotherapy during
the later interval had a lower mortality risk than those treated with surgery only (HR, 0.664;
95% CI, 0.623-0.707; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the National Cancer Database, adjuvant chemotherapy
remained efficacious when started 7 to 18 weeks after non–small-cell lung cancer resection.
Patients who recover slowly from non–small-cell lung cancer surgery may still benefit from
delayed adjuvant chemotherapy started up to 4 months after surgery.

L
ung cancer is a particularly aggressive disease, result-
ing in over 158 000 deaths a year in the United States.1,2
Even patients with locoregionally confined non–small-
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that undergo complete surgical re-
section (negative surgical margins) carry a significant risk for
systemic failure.3 In an effort to reduce the risk of NSCLC re-
currence, chemotherapy has been administered in the post-
operative period with encouraging results. More specifically,
a number of clinical trials and meta-analyses have estab-
lished a survival benefit when chemotherapy is given to pa-
tients who underwent surgery and have lymph node metas-
tasesorhavelargerorlocallyinvasivetumors.4-11Consequently,
adjuvant chemotherapy has become a standard recommen-
dation for patients with NSCLC with lymph node metastases,
tumors 4 cm or larger, or extensive local invasion.12-14
While a consensus has been established regarding the in-
dications for adjuvant chemotherapy, the optimal timing fol-
lowing surgical resection remains poorly defined. Many clini-
ciansendorseinitiatingchemotherapywithin6weeksofsurgical
resection.5,6 However, patients vary considerably in their abil-
itytotolerateadjuvanttherapywhilerecoveringfromalungcan-
cer resection.15 Multiple factors including patient health, ex-
tent and approach of surgical resection, and the occurrence of
postoperativecomplicationsmayaffectapatient’
sabilitytotol-
erate systemic therapy in the perioperative period.16,17
Recently,concernshaveemergedoverthepossibilityforde-
lays in the administration of chemotherapy to compromise the
efficacyofadjuvanttreatment.Forexample,incoloncancer18-20
and breast cancer,21 delays in the initiation of chemotherapy
have been associated with decreased overall survival (OS).
Patients with lung cancer in particular may be slow to regain
their preoperative performance status after surgery, second-
ary to advanced age, prevalence of smoking-related lung dis-
ease, and higher risk for postoperative complications.15,22,23
Therefore, the relationship between the time to initiate adju-
vant chemotherapy and its effectiveness is highly relevant to
clinical practice.
The National Cancer Database (NCDB) is one of the larg-
est and most comprehensive clinical oncology registries in the
world, capturing more than 70% of incident lung cancer cases
in the United States with robust long-term follow-up. Further-
more, the NCDB contains detailed treatment information in-
cluding time intervals between different components of mul-
timodaltherapy(eg,surgerypluschemotherapy,radiotherapy,
etc). Therefore, the NCDB is uniquely suited to analyze the re-
lationship between time to initiation of adjuvant chemo-
therapy in NSCLC and long-term outcomes. We evaluated the
relationship between postoperative chemotherapy timing and
5-year mortality, comparing results with patients treated with
surgery alone, to better understand the impact of treatment
delay on the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for NSCLC.
Methods
Data Source
The NCDB is a hospital-based tumor registry managed by the
American College of Surgeons in collaboration with the Ameri-
canCancerSociety.24TheinstitutionalreviewboardoftheYale
School of Medicine approved this study with consent waived.
Study Population
The NCDB Participant User File (version 2013) was queried for
treatment-naive (ie, no preoperative therapy) patients 20 years
or older, managed with adjuvant chemotherapy after com-
plete resection (ie, negative margins) of NSCLC. Patients diag-
nosed with invasive NSCLC from January 2004 to December
2012 for whom that diagnosis represented their first malig-
nancy were included. Only patients who underwent lobec-
tomy or pneumonectomy for pathological stage I, II, or III
NSCLCandreceivedmultiagentchemotherapywereincluded.14
To be consistent with current treatment indications for adju-
vant chemotherapy, patients with stage I disease and tumors
smaller than 4 cm were excluded.14,25 Patients with incom-
plete pathologic staging or missing treatment or follow-up in-
formation,thosewithcarcinomain-situorcarcinoid,andthose
treatedwithadjuvantradiotherapywerealsoexcluded.Tomini-
mize the impact of outliers, patients in the top and bottom 2%
with respect to time to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy were
excluded from the study. Finally, 30-day mortalities were ex-
cluded from all groups, as patients undergoing chemotherapy
must have survived the perioperative period in order to re-
ceive chemotherapy (ie, immortal time bias). Recognizing the
greater potential for immortal time bias with delayed chemo-
therapy, the comparative analyses (Cox model and propensity
matching) were repeated including only those patients known
to be alive at 120 days (all groups landmarked at 120 days) with
nomeaningfulchangeinresults(eTable4intheSupplement).26
A separate cohort of patients with surgically managed
NSCLC was created using the same selection criteria but in-
cluding patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy
and were treated with surgery alone. The selection steps are
summarized in Figure 1.

Key Points
Question Does delaying the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy
after non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resection affect its
efficacy?
Findings In this retrospective study of 12 473 patients with NSCLC
from the National Cancer Database, adjuvant chemotherapy given
later (57–127 days) in the postoperative period was not associated
with mortality. Furthermore, patients who received adjuvant
chemotherapy later had a significantly better survival when
compared with patients treated with surgery alone.
Meaning Patients with a delayed recovery from NSCLC resection
may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy started up to 4 months
after surgery.

The study period was affected by a transition from the 6th
edition to the 7th edition of the AJCC lung cancer staging sys-
tem, reflected in the NCDB starting in 2010. Since patients
coded prior to 2010 did not contain sufficient staging data for
conversiontothe7thAJCCedition,ahomogenousstudygroup
was created by converting patients diagnosed between 2010
and 2012 to the corresponding 6th edition stage.29
Statistical Analysis
Cox Model With Restricted Cubic Splines
Toevaluatetheimpactoftimetoadjuvantchemotherapyonsur-
vival, a multivariable Cox model with restricted cubic splines
(RCS) was built. The use of RCS has been widely described as a
valid strategy to analyze the relationship between survival and
independentvariables.30,31Furthermore,RCShasrecentlybeen
usedtostudytherelationbetweensurvivalandtreatmentinpa-

This technique provides greater flexibility for fitting data and

ditionally,RCSpermitsidentificationoftheriskfunctioninflex-

and type of resection. The spline was defined using three knots
at the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles.30 The threshold was de-
termined as the point in time with the smallest hazard ratio
(HR).31 The 95% CI was derived by bootstrap resampling.
Stratification of Cohort by Chemotherapy Timing
Ratherthandichotomizeourpopulationaccordingtoasinglecut-
point (ie, 50 days between surgery and start of chemotherapy),
we felt it was more relevant to clinical practice to evaluate che-
motherapy timing within intervals, as the chemotherapy effect
was unlikely to have an abrupt spike and fall in efficacy across
time. The interval of time between surgery and the initiation of
chemotherapy that corresponded to the RCS-determined low-
estmortalitywasconsideredthereferenceinterval(39-56days).
Patients in whom chemotherapy was started prior to this refer-
ence interval were considered the earlier group (18-38 days),
whilepatientswhostartedchemotherapyafterthereferencein-
terval were considered the later group (57-127 days). An ad-
justed survival analysis was performed using a Cox model with
3levelsforadjuvanttiming(earlier,referenceinterval,andlater).

Propensity Matching: Surgery With Adjuvant Chemotherapy
vs Surgery Alone
To validate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in this con-
text, the patients in the 3 time cohorts were compared with pa-
tients treated with surgery only (SO). There was an imbalance
in the number of patients within the adjuvant and SO groups;
with 3359 patients in the earlier group, 5137 in the reference
intervalgroup,and3977inthelaterchemotherapygroup,while
the SO group had 19 001 patients. Large imbalances in risk fac-
tors can lead to spurious treatment-effect findings. In addi-
tion, adjuvant chemotherapy was evolving as the standard of
care within this study period, raising the potential for treat-
ment bias between the adjuvant and SO cohorts.7 Therefore,
we used 1:1 propensity matching in an effort to isolate the ef-
fectofadjuvantchemotherapyinsimilarpatientpopulations.33
Patients were matched on facility type and location, age, sex,
race, Hispanic origin, CD score, insurance, income, educa-
tion, area of residence, year of diagnosis, tumor size, primary
site, laterality, histological type, grade, pathological stage, and
type of resection. The standardized difference of each vari-
able was calculated and found to be less than 0.1.34 A separate
propensity matching was performed for each time-based co-
hort of patients who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy (ear-
lier, reference interval, later) and patients treated with SO. The
propensity match was done using a previously described SAS
macro (SAS Institute Inc).35 The 5-year mortality was com-
pared in a Cox model using the SO group as the reference.
Logistic Regression for Later Initiation of Chemotherapy
Toidentifyfactorsindependentlyassociatedwithdelayedinitia-
tionofadjuvantchemotherapy(ie,thelatergroup),multivariable
logistic regression models were built (considering all variables
listed in data elements except for 90-day mortality) accounting
for clustering at the hospital level. Backward elimination was
implemented for model refinement with a type III P value of .2

plots of the survival functions were performed to evaluate vio-
lations of the proportional hazards assumption. Standardized
difference, RCS, and a post hoc power analysis were calculated
using R version 3.2.2 (R Foundation). All other statistical analy-
ses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Patient Characteristics
A total of 31 474 patients met inclusion criteria; 12 473 who re-
ceived adjuvant chemotherapy and 19 001 treated with SO.
Among those treated with adjuvant therapy, the median time
to chemotherapy initiation was 48 days (interquartile range
[IQR], 37-62; range, 18-127 days). The characteristics of the ear-
lier, reference interval, and later chemotherapy subgroups and
the patients treated with SO are shown in Table 1 .
Adjusted Mortality by Time to Initiation
of Adjuvant Chemotherapy
As an initial exploration into the relationship between adju-
vant chemotherapy timing and outcome, an adjusted Cox
model was created with adjuvant chemotherapy timing in-
cluded as a categorical variable (separated into 7-day inter-
vals). The median follow-up for surviving patients from day
of surgery was 46 months (IQR, 28-73). Patients in the 49 days
interval were used as the reference as they represented the co-
hort median for chemotherapy timing. The plotted HRs are
shown in Figure 2B. No consistent correlation between mor-
tality risk and chemotherapy timing was observed.
Restricted Cubic Splines to Identify Adjuvant Timing
Associated With Lowest Mortality Risk
To more rigorously evaluate the relationship between chemo-
therapy timing and survival, a Cox model with RCS was cre-
ated yielding an inflection point in the risk function at 50 days
(Figure 3). The population was stratified according to 3 tim-
ing intervals (earlier, reference interval, and later) defined
around the RCS-derived inflection point. The reference inter-
val refers to patients that started chemotherapy in the time-
frame corresponding to the 95% CI for the RCS inflection point
(39-56days).Theearliersubgroupreferstopatientswhosetime
to initiation of chemotherapy was shorter than the reference
interval (18-38 days), while the later subgroup was comprised
of patients who started chemotherapy after the reference in-
terval (57-127 days).
Adjuvant Efficacy Relative to the Reference Interval
Unadjusted KM 5-year OS estimates were not significantly dif-
ferent between the 3 groups (earlier, 53%; reference interval,
55%; later, 53%; log-rank P = .23). A post hoc power analysis
demonstrated a 91% probability of finding a 2% difference in
5-year OS between adjuvant chemotherapy groups. Further-
more, an adjusted Cox model did not show differences in sur-
vivalbetweentheearlierandlatergroupswhencomparedwith
the reference interval (earlier HR, 1.009; 95% CI, 0.944-
1.080; P = .79 and later HR, 1.037; 95% CI, 0.972-1.105; P = .27)
(Table 2).
Impact of Chemotherapy Timing on Efficacy
of Adjuvant Over Surgery Alone
To confirm the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy, each
adjuvant chemotherapy subgroup (earlier, reference interval,
later) was compared with similarly staged patients (stage I
≥4cm, stage II, and stage III) treated with SO (Table 1). A pro-
pensity-matched analysis was performed resulting in well-
balancedpairs(earlier,3277pairs;referenceinterval,4967;later,
3976) (eTables 1-3 in the Supplement). Univariate Cox models
of propensity-matched pairs (with SO as the reference) sug-
gested that the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy, re-

The survival analyses were landmarked at 120 days to de-

strated a similar mortality risk of earlier (HR, 1.003; 95% CI,

(eTable 4 in the Supplement). The univariate Cox models of
the chemotherapy groups propensity matched to the SO group

Predictors of Later Initiation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy
In an attempt to understand the factors that influence chemo-
therapy timing, a multivariate logistic regression was per-
formedtoidentifypredictorsoflaterinitiation(>56days)ofad-
juvant chemotherapy (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Increased
age, being nonwhite, having Medicaid or no insurance, lower
education, squamous cell carcinoma, undetermined grade,
pneumonectomyresection,extendedlengthofstay(>14days),
and unplanned 30-day readmission were significant predic-
tors of delayed initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy.

Discussion
The current study tested the hypothesis that chemotherapy
remained efficacious when given outside of the traditional
postoperative window, in hopes of providing greater flexibil-
ityforclinicianstoallowpatientstorecoverfromsurgerywhen
needed. The timing of adjuvant chemotherapy was stratified
relative to a mathematically derived window (ie, reference in-
terval [39-56 days]). This timeframe is remarkably consistent
with the 6 to 9 week window for the initiation of adjuvant che-
motherapy mandated by many of the NSCLC adjuvant che-
motherapy trials that have shaped the current standard of
care.4,6,25,36 Although most (41%) of our population received
adjuvant chemotherapy within this interval, 32% of our co-
hort initiated chemotherapy more than 56 days after surgery.
As one might expect, those who started chemotherapy later
were more likely to have a prolonged length of inpatient stay
and to be readmitted, suggesting they were more likely to have
experienced a challenging postoperative course.37 Interest-
ingly, several sociodemographic factors (advanced age, unin-
sured status, low education) were independent predictors for
later administration of chemotherapy, potentially illustrating
socioeconomic barriers to timely care.38
Our key findings with respect to adjuvant timing can be
summarizedas:(1)laterchemotherapytiming(57-127dayspost-
operatively) did not consistently compromise survival expec-
tations (compared with 39-56 days); and (2) patients who re-
ceived chemotherapy later still had lower risk of mortality than
thosetreatedwithSO.Thesefindingsindicatethatpatientswho
receive adjuvant chemotherapy up to 4 months after surgery
may continue to derive benefit from chemotherapy. This con-
clusion is supported by several smaller series for NSCLC which
did not identify a difference in chemotherapy efficacy accord-
ing to the time administered.37,39,40 More specifically, Booth
et al39 and Ramsden et al37 analyzed the effect by using cut-
offpointsbasedontheNSCLCadjuvanttrialsandfoundnosur-
vival differences in patients with a delayed initiation of adju-
vant chemotherapy. Likewise, Zhu et al,40 using a statistically
derived threshold, analyzed this effect in patients with stage
IIIA NSCLC and found that time to adjuvant chemotherapy had
no impact on disease-free survival.
Limitations
Our study had several limitations in addition to those com-
monly associated with retrospective studies. First, the NCDB

whetherchemotherapywasdelayedforspecificreasons(eg,sur-
gical complication). As a result, our data indicates that delays
inchemotherapydonotprecludeasurvivalbenefit,butwecan-
not predict the efficacy for any specific clinical scenario that af-
fects adjuvant chemotherapy timing (eg, delay for pulmonary
embolism). Additionally, the NCDB does not capture informa-
tion on specific chemotherapy regimens. Although the cohort
was limited to patients that received multiagent chemo-
therapy, unknown differences in specific agents and dosim-
etrymayimpactsurvival.Furthermore,theNCDBdoesnotpos-
sess information on cancer-specific survival, and as such our
results are limited to OS. Thus, delays in chemotherapy might
notimpactOSbutcouldhaveanimpactonrecurrence-freesur-
vival. Finally, it is possible that the comparison groups dif-
fered in characteristics not embedded in the NCDB (perfor-
mance status, pulmonary function tests, etc) that could
potentially impact the administration of adjuvant chemo-
therapy. This bias may disproportionately affect the SO co-
hort, as this patient subgroup appeared to be eligible for adju-
vant chemotherapy but did not receive it. Recognizing that the
standard of care evolved during the study period, failure to re-
ceiveadjuvantchemotherapymayreflectotherriskfactorswith
the potential to affect OS (eg, poor health, major postoperative
complication, treating team unaware of practice standards).
While we believe these results indicate that chemo-
therapy remains effective when given up to 4 months postop-
eratively, these findings should not be interpreted to mean that
chemotherapy has an equivalent effect, irrespective of when
itisgiven.Althoughourstudypopulationwaslargeandthepost
hoc analysis indicated appropriate statistical power, the che-
motherapyeffectisrelativelysmall(5%differenceinsurvival).41
Therefore, it is possible that a small but significant difference
in survival exists based on when chemotherapy is given but is
not able to be appreciated within this data set.

Editor's Note
Bringing Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Resected
Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer Into Real-world Practice—
Better Late Than Never?
Howard (Jack) West, MD
The data from a wide range of prospective, randomized
phase 3 trials are clear: There is a significant survival benefit
from adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy for patients
with resected higher-risk
non–small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), often defined as
node-positive and/or with the primary tumor measuring 4 cm
or greater in diameter.1 As in many clinical settings, however,
patientsinreal-worldpracticearenotwellrepresentedbythose
on the relevant clinical trials, as those in the pivotal adjuvant
trials are approximately a decade younger and with a near uni-
formly good performance status. A clinical trial directly com-
paringpreoperativewithpostoperativechemotherapyforearly-
stage NSCLC also demonstrated an attrition rate of 34% for
postoperative chemotherapy within the protocol-defined win-
dow of 6 to 7 weeks owing to a wide range of complicating
factors.2 In practice, this means that many patients who would
otherwise be appropriate candidates for adjuvant chemo-
therapydonotpresentforconsiderationoftreatmentuntillater
than best practices would recommend. Should an interven-
tion with an established survival benefit be deferred in this set-
ting? While we do not have prospective evidence to speak to
this, absence of proof is not proof of absence.
Every clinic day, oncologists and other physicians face the
challenge of how far to extrapolate from the results of clinical
trials with often narrowly defined clinic populations to a
broader population of patients in our clinics. Here, the study
by Salazar and colleagues,3 a retrospective analysis of sur-
vival among 12 473 postoperative patients with results cap-
tured in the National Cancer Database, and with the afore-
mentioned criteria defining appropriate level of risk of
recurrence, compared survival outcomes for patients who ini-
tiated adjuvant chemotherapy early (18-36 days), late (57-114
days), or at a time between these intervals. The results dem-
onstrated no hint of inferior survival among the patients who
received chemotherapy in the later time period, beyond which
we have data from clinical trials. Moreover, a Cox analysis of
nearly 4000 propensity-matched pairs of patients demon-
strated that adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a
lower mortality risk than surgery alone, including among pa-
tientswhoinitiatedadjuvantchemotherapymorethan8weeks
after surgery.
While retrospective data cannot define the benefit of de-
layed adjuvant chemotherapy with the clarity of a prospec-
tive randomized trial, we must remember that in the land of
the blind, the one-eyed man is king; these limited data inject
an evidence-based answer for a very common clinical ques-
tion for which we have been forced by necessity to rely only
on our best judgments. But real-world data from large popu-
lations also provide a valuable corroboration of data obtained
in randomized clinical trials of potentially nonrepresentative
patients. In the absence of prospective data for every patient,
such retrospective data are valuable in offering the best evi-
dence available for clinicians charged with the task of offer-
ing the best treatment recommendations for practical man-
agement of a broad population of patients that includes many
who would not qualify for more restrictive clinical trials on
which we rely to establish clinical standards.
