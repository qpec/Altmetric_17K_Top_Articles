The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a major division of the nervous system and vital to the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract and its communication with the rest of the body. Unlike the brain
and spinal cord, relatively little is known about the ENS in part because of the inability to
directly monitor its activity in live animals. Here, we integrate a transparent graphene sensor
with a customized abdominal window for simultaneous optical and electrical recording of the
ENS in vivo. The implanted device captures ENS responses to neurotransmitters, drugs and
optogenetic manipulation in real time.

 T
he enteric nervous system (ENS) contains the largest
population of neurons in the peripheral nervous system,
five times the amount in the spinal cord, and is often
referred to as the ‘second brain’ due to its autonomous functions1.
Organized into two types of ganglia, the myenteric and
submucosal plexuses, the ENS is composed of motor neurons,
sensory neurons and interneurons, and it is responsible for
regulating vital functions such as gut motility and homeostasis2,3.
Damage to the ENS is associated with inflammatory bowel
disease, irritable bowel syndrome and other functional GI
disorders4–6, which affect one quarter of the world’s population
and result in over 21.7 million hospitalizations and $141.8 billion
in costs each year7,8. ENS dysfunction often accompanies
systemic conditions such as obesity and diabetes, and emerging
evidence suggests a link between Parkinson’s disease and the
ENS9–11.
Compared with the central nervous system, less is known about
the ENS circuitry and its electrophysiological dynamics. For
example, although ENS dysfunction is known to be associated
with diseases like functional GI disorders, the exact electro-
physiology is less clear12,13. As opposed to the brain and spinal
cord, which can be imaged via cranial and spinal windows and
recorded via implantable electrodes14–16, a major limitation in
deciphering the ENS circuitry is our inability to optically image or
electrically record ENS activities in live animals. Particular
challenges for ENS recording include: the peristatic movements
of
the
intestine,
high
background
noise
associated
with
surrounding longitudinal and circular muscles, lack of a fixed
surface (for example, the skull or spine) to stabilize the device
and maintain good contact, and the highly immunogenic
gastrointestinal (GI) environment that interferes with ENS
activities (in contrast, the central nervous system is much more
immune tolerant towards foreign substrates)17–19. Gut movement
also makes it extremely challenging to track the same groups of
enteric neurons over multiple imaging sessions. Furthermore,
given our limited knowledge about the ENS electrophysiology
and high background noise, it is important to develop capabilities
of simultaneous optical/electrical recording to take advantage of
available transgenic reporter mice to validate and interpret
recorded data.
The ENS has been imaged previously in an acute setup, where
the intestine was brought out of the abdominal cavity, and the
mouse was killed after the imaging session20. This method has
several limitations if being applied to ENS recording: (i) the
external environment and stretching the intestine out of the
abdomen create artefacts due to ENS sensitivity to mechanical
and chemical stimuli; (ii) the imaging duration is limited and
(iii) this setup does not allow chronic monitoring over an
extended
period,
which
is
important
for
understanding
ENS-related physiology in health and disease.
An intravital abdominal window was previously developed
to image intestinal epithelial stem cells21. In this setup, the
intestine was glued to the coverslip on the window, which was
also kept in place by glue. However, the glue causes substantial
local inflammation, which could interfere with ENS activity,
and makes this approach ill-suited for studying ENS. Other
factors also make this approach impractical for chronic (repeated)
studies of
the ENS. The
tendency of
coverslip
breakage
hinders repeated imaging sessions and prevents integration
of electrical recording devices. Peristaltic movements often
cause the intestine to break off from the glue and detach from
the
window.
Adhering
the
intestine
to
the
window
can
cause intestinal obstruction or chronic inflammation, leading to
high-mortality rates, fibrosis and mucus buildup, preventing
repeated measures of the ENS function over the course of the
experiment.
To
overcome
these
limitations,
a
three-dimensional
(3D)-printed insert is designed and surgically implanted into
the animal to stabilize the intestine without blocking its motility
functions. Through a customized abdominal intravital window,
we manage to chronically image the same location in the mouse
gut over several days and observe neuronal firing using the
transgenic
Pirt-GCaMP3
mice.
By
further
integrating
a
transparent graphene sensor into the window, we demonstrate
the
ability
to
perform
concurrent
optical
and
electrical
recording of ENS activity, with high spatiotemporal resolution
to detect waveforms of single action potentials (APs) from
individual enteric neurons. We use these novel capabilities
to analyse the effects of various chemical and biomolecular
stimuli and optogenetic manipulations on the gut, showing
that such in vivo, real-time detection methods provide unique
information necessary for the understanding of gut functionality
in vivo.
Results
In vivo imaging using abdominal window. We designed a
customized window to overcome the limitations found in earlier
window designs. We started by surgically inserting a window into
the fascia and skin layer of the mouse abdomen. The window uses
thermally resistant, borosilicate glass, which is also much less
susceptible to damage and less likely to break than conventional
glass coverslips. Below the window, a 3D-printed insert holds the
intestine in place while providing support and prevent ischaemia
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Unlike a chemical adhesive, the implant
is not adhered to the intestine, minimizing inflammation.
Meanwhile, it can be tightened to reduce tissue movement
without blocking proper digestion functions and peristalsis,
extending the lifetime of the mouse. In other applications, such as
intravital cranial and spinal windows, implants are placed at
locations inaccessible to the mice, but abdominal windows are
subject to constant scratching. We therefore developed a protocol
using vet wrap to prevent the mouse from damaging the window,
which substantially prolonged mouse survival and avoided
inflammation (Supplementary Video 1). The mice implanted with
the window consistently live up to 3 months, until they are killed
for humane reasons.
We demonstrated that it is possible to image the ENS in vivo
using this setup. Wnt1-cre:tdTomato mice were chronically
imaged with inverted multiphoton microscopy (Fig. 1a). In this
transgenic strain, enteric neurons and other neural crest progeny
are labelled with tdTomato22,23. The grid-like myenteric plexus
formed by individual neurons is clearly visible through the
transplanted abdominal window. To track the same set of enteric
neurons on different days, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-
dextran was injected retro-orbitally into the mouse to stain the
vasculature, which served as a reference roadmap to locate the
same region of the ENS (Fig. 1b–e and Supplementary Fig. 2).
During subsequent imaging sessions, we were able to identify the
same neurons using this vasculature roadmap. The plexus and
vasculature morphology remained largely unchanged 11 days
after the implantation surgery.
Detection of ENS activity via graphene electrodes. To perform
simultaneous electrical recording, we needed to integrate elec-
trodes onto the abdominal window. The electrical recording
device needs to be: (i) transparent to allow imaging through the
device, (ii) inert and biocompatible to minimize fibrosis and
inflammation, (iii) highly sensitive to detect ENS APs from
background noise and (iv) durable for long-term chronic mon-
itoring. To meet these stringent requirements, we developed a
graphene-based electrode array that can be integrated onto the

 abdominal window to measure electrical activities in the ENS.
Consisting of a carbon sheet one atom thick, graphene offers
unique advantages as a transparent material with superb
conductivity (zero bandgap), biocompatibility (an inert surface)
and strength (Young’s modulus higher than diamond and 207
times stronger than steel by weight)24,25.
The chip contains nine graphene electrodes, ranging from
50 mm by 50 mm to 500 mm by 500 mm. Graphene was grown on a
copper substrate via a vertical cold-wall chemical vapour
deposition system and was transferred onto a transparent quartz
surface. Gold interconnects, 150 nm thick, were evaporated onto
the surface and protected by insulating photoresist that left the
contact pads exposed (Supplementary Fig. 3). To integrate the
graphene sensor onto the abdominal window for surgical
implantation, a piece of borosilicate glass, containing eight
via-holes, 250 mm diameter, was inserted into a titanium ring
and fixed in place by a horseshoe spring. The graphene chip was
then secured to the borosilicate glass using transparent, insulating
epoxy. Wires were threaded through the glass and secured to the
connection pads using silver epoxy. The glass via-holes and
connection pads were sealed using transparent insulating epoxy
to protect the connection (Supplementary Fig. 4).
The integration of graphene sensor and abdominal window
provides us with the capability of simultaneous optical imaging
and electrical recording in live mice. We surgically implanted the
device into Pirt-GCaMP3 mice such that the customized 3D
insert held the small intestine in contact with the exposed
graphene electrodes without disrupting digestive and motility
functions (Fig. 2a–d). Through the transparent graphene sensor,
the inverted multiphoton microscope was able to track activation
of individual neurons in the myenteric plexus, which were
fluorescently labelled via their genetically encoded GCaMP3

Supplementary Video 2).
We
then
performed
simultaneous
optical
and
electrical
recording to track activated neurons in the myenteric plexus of
Pirt-GCaMP3 mice. The timing of multiphoton microscopy and
the electrical recording apparatus are synchronized by a timing
gate. Bursts of activity in GCaMP3 fluorescence (measured by
multiphoton microscopy) and in electrical potential (measured by
the graphene sensor) maintained high synchrony in vivo (Fig. 2e).
The synchrony between electrical recording and optical imaging
validates the mutual dependence between electrical potential
spikes and the GCaMP fluorescence associated with APs. The
combined optical/electrical measurements confirmed that our
integrated abdominal device was indeed capable of capturing ENS
APs, which is important given our limited knowledge about the
ENS and the noise from the surrounding muscle layers.
Compared with optical imaging, the sensitive graphene sensor
provides much higher temporal resolution with greater signal-to-
noise ratio, which allowed us to examine the detailed biphasic
waveforms of ENS APs (Fig. 2f).
ENS activity in response to chemical stimulations. ENS
activities are spatiotemporally regulated by various neuro-
transmitters. For instance, the majority of the serotonin in the
human body is produced in the GI tract to regulate intestinal
movements27,28. However, there was previously no means of
studying real-time ENS response to these neurotransmitters
in vivo. As proof-of-concept, we used the integrated device to
study ENS response to acetylcholine and serotonin. Repeated
optical imaging and electrical recording in distinct animals
demonstrated that GCaMP3 fluorescence and electrical potential
consistently
followed
the
same
trend
upon
delivery
of
acetylcholine or serotonin, consistent with activation of enteric
neurons (Fig. 3a–d). The electrical potential measured by the
graphene sensor showed a faster deactivation rate than GCaMP3
fluorescence, highlighting the relative slow response kinetics of
GCaMP relative to electrical potential. Our data suggest that
optical imaging with GCaMP3 technology provides better spatial
resolution
for
tracking
AP
location,
whereas
electrical
measurement provides higher temporal resolution to track AP
dynamics. The integrated device combines both to provide a
more comprehensive picture of ENS spatiotemporal activities in
real time in live animals.
There are a range of Food and Drug Administration-approved
small-molecule drugs that act via acetylcholine and serotonin
receptors. Bethanechol targets muscarinic acetylcholine receptors,
which can increase GI muscular tone and urinary retention29,30.
Tegaserod is an agonist for the serotonin receptor 5-HT4 to
stimulate GI motility and peristatic reflexes, which could relieve
bloating
and
constipation
associated
with
irritable
bowel
syndrome31. However, acetylcholine and serotonin also activate
other receptors that the drugs do not target (for example,
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors).
We compared ENS responses with acetylcholine, bethanechol,
serotonin and tegaserod, which were delivered via intraperitoneal
(IP) injections. Experiments were designed to record 2 min of
unperturbed activity before the chemical stimulation and an
additional 2 min to observe post-stimulus activity. Compared
with the phosphate-buffered saline control, both native trans-
mitters and the drugs were capable of increasing activity in the
ENS (Fig. 4a–d). The graphene sensor captured detailed wave-
forms of the activated APs (Fig. 4e–h). Quantification of repeated
recordings in different mice confirmed an increase in the number
of spikes when stimulated by either neurotransmitter or agonist
drug (Fig. 4i, Supplementary Figs 6,7 and Supplementary
Table 1). Chronic recordings of the same ENS regions over 5
days showed that activities of enteric neurons were either
consistently responsive or non-responsive to the serotonin stimuli
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Application of tetrodotoxin (TTX), which
blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, consistently suppressed
measured ENS activities in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 9). 200 ml of

 133 mM Tegaserod was also delivered via oral gavage, which was
sufficient to stimulate ENS activities (Supplementary Fig. 10).
ENS activity in response to 470 nm light stimulations. The
transparent integrated device also enables us to take advantage of
optogenetic technology. In optogenetic mice, light can be applied
through the abdominal window and the transparent graphene
sensor to stimulate light-gated ion channels, and subsequent
ENS responses will be recorded by the graphene sensor. For

To demonstrate 470 nm light inhibition in the nitrergic
neurons in the NOS1-creERT2:Chr2 animals, recordings were
designed to have 5 min of unperturbed activity before a 15-s
470 nm light stimulation, followed by an additional 5 min
of recording to observe post-stimulus activity. We found
that stimulation at 470 nm in Chr2-expressing mice reduced
spontaneous activity in naturally active regions of the ENS by
83.66% (Fig. 5c,d, Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary
Table 2). In contrast, the same 470-nm incident light stimulation
had little effect in wild-type mice, which do not express

 efficiency, as activities had not fully recovered from the previous
stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 12). It should be noted that as
NOS1-expressing neurons also commonly co-express other
neurotransmitters, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),
further studies are needed to interpret the physiological basis of
these results. Nevertheless, the experiments provide proof of
principle for the ability to detect change in ENS activity by
targeting specific cell type.
Collectively, we demonstrated simultaneous optical/electrical
recording of the ENS in real time by developing an integrated
abdominal implant device. The recording can be repeated in live
animals carrying this device. Characterization of the ENS
response to neurotransmitter/chemical stimuli and optogenetic
manipulation was demonstrated. The device has the potential to
aid our understanding of the ENS, its role in diseases and its
interaction with infection, inflammation, microbiota and the
gut–brain axis.
Methods
Ethics statement. All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the
Cornell University Institutional Care and Use Committee (protocol no. 2010-0100
and 2015-0029) and were conducted in strict accordance with the recommenda-
tions in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the
National Institutes of Health.
Animal models. Pirt-GCaMP3 mice were generated previously26. The
Wnt1-cre:tdTomato mice were generated by crossing Tg(Wnt1-cre)11Rth
Tg(Wnt1-GAL4)11Rth/J (Jackson Laboratory: 003829) with Ai14 (Jackson
Laboratory: 007914). The Nos1-creERT2:Chr2 mice were generated by crossing
B6:129S-Nos1tm1.1(cre/ERT2)Zjh/J (Jackson Laboratory: 014541) with Ai32 (Jackson
Laboratory: 012569). Gene expression was induced in Nos1-creERT2:Chr2 mice by
tamoxifen IP injection at 75 mg kg � 1 daily for 5 days.
Graphene sensor manufacturing. Graphene was grown in a chemical vapour
deposition system on copper substrate and transferred using poly(methyl
methacrylate) to a quartz substrate34. The chip was then patterned with
interconnects and a photoresist layer, using standard fabrication techniques
at the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Facility. Gold interconnects are
protected with a layer of photoresist, and they connect exposed contact pads to the
exposed graphene electrodes (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). The electrode array
(Supplementary Fig. 3e) consists of nine graphene electrodes, ranging from 50 mm
by 50 mm to 500 mm by 500 mm.
Graphene sensor and window integration. Eight via-holes (250 mm diameter)
were cut through the borosilicate glass (10 mm diameter) using a laser (VersaLaser
VLS3.50). The graphene device was mounted on the glass with transparent epoxy
(Hardman Epoxy, 04004). Stranded copper wire (Cooner Wire, CZ1101-A) carry
the signal off chip and through via-holes in the window. Copper wire was fixed to
gold contact pads using conductive epoxy (MG Chemicals, 83302-21G). Finally,
transparent epoxy was used to protect and insulate the copper–gold interface. The
transparent epoxy was also used to seal the copper wire in via-holes to maintain
separation between the internal and external environments during surgical
implantation (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Recording from the graphene sensor. The electrical potential was recorded by
two identical graphene electrodes of the array. From the copper wires, the signal
was delivered to a differential AC amplifier (A-M Systems, 1,700) at a 20-kHz
sampling rate, where it received a � 100 gain and band-pass filter between 300 Hz
and 5 kHz. Following amplification, the signal was processed using data acquisition
board (NI, BNC-2110) and software (NI, Signal Express).
Chronic abdominal window surgery. We used adult mice ranging from 6 to
12 weeks of age. Animals were anaesthetized with isoflurane (4% vol/vol induction
with 2–3% maintenance) and eye ointment was applied. The abdomen was shaved
and cleaned with povidone iodine and ethanol (70% (vol/vol) in water). After a
local injection of bupivacaine (0.1% (wt/vol) in saline, 0.1 ml per mouse) and
atropine sulfate (0.05 mg kg � 1), a circular incision (7 mm) was made into the skin
over the mouse abdomen followed by a circular incision (4 mm radius) into the
muscle wall, which was prepared inside of skin incision. During all procedures
when the mouse was under anaesthesia, body temperature was maintained at
37.5 �C by a thermostatically regulated heating pad, and 0.1 ml of glucose (5%
(wt/vol) in physiological saline) was applied every hour. A sterile, 3D-printed insert
was implanted into the surgical site. A portion of the intestine was moved on top of
the insert. The insert was fixed in place with sutures attached to the abdominal
muscle. The abdominal window was placed over the incision site, and the ring
was attached to the surrounding skin by using instant adhesive (Loctite 406).
For surgical procedures involving the sensor, the graphene chip had been adhered
to the secured coverslip before the procedure. Once the adhesive had been secured,
a 20-mm band of self-adhering vet wrap (3 M VetRap) was wrapped around the
abdomen to prevent damage to the surgical site while the mouse is awake and to
protect the wire connections. After the surgery, the animal was removed from
anaesthesia and allowed to recover (Supplementary Video 1). Subcutaneous
injections of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (0.2 mg kg � 1; American Regent,
Inc.) and ketoprofen (5 mg kg � 1; Fort Dodge) were given every 24 h for 3 days
following surgery.
In vivo multiphoton imaging. In vivo imaging was conducted on a Zeiss LSM880
confocal/multiphoton inverted microscope. Fluorescence emission was collected in
two different channels: 505–545 nm wavelengths for FITC and green fluorescent
protein detection, and 560–650 nm for tdTomato detection. Green fluorescent
protein excitation wavelength was 900 nm, and simultaneous FITC and tdTomato
excitation wavelengths were 1,000 nm. Excitation was performed by an InSight
DeepSee laser. A � 10/0.5 air EC Plan-Neofluar objective was used to visualize the
cells in vivo. Mice were anaesthetized with isofluorane (4% (vol/vol) with 2–3%
maintenance), and eye ointment was applied. Vet wrap was removed to expose the
glass window, and the mice were placed on a 3D-printed imaging stage. To
visualize the vasculature, 50 ml of FITC-Dextran dye (Sigma-Aldrich) was injected
retro-orbitally. After the imaging was completed, mouse abdomens were rewrapped
in fresh vet wrap to prevent scratching. Imaging was performed once every other
day to allow the mouse time to recover between imaging sessions.
Chronic chemical and 470 nm light stimulations. Post-surgery, mice were
anaesthetized with isofluorane (4% vol/vol with 2–3% maintenance), and eye
ointment was applied. Vet wrap was removed to expose the graphene sensor and
copper wires (Supplementary Video 3). The copper wires were connected to the
amplifier. Chemical stimulation consisted of IP injection of either 100 mM
acetylcholine (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mM bethanechol (VWR), 10 mM serotonin
(Fisher), 133 mM tegaserod (Santa Cruz Biotech), 1 mM Tetrodotoxin citrate
(Abcam) or saline (Fisher), in 50 ml quantities. TTX was applied to three mice in a
terminal procedure. For the oral drug treatment, mice were given 200 ml of 133 mM
tegaserod (Santa Cruz Biotech) via oral gavage. Mice were not exposed to more
than four chemical stimulations in a single procedure and stimulation procedures
were done at least 2 days apart to allow the mouse to recover. Light stimulations
were executed using an AURA light engine at 230 mW. Stimulation consisted of
470 nm light for 15 s through the abdominal window and graphene electrodes.
Electrical recording consisted of 2 min of background activity, stimulation,
followed by at least 2 min of post-stimulus activity. Oral gavage required a 3-min
delay between the pre-stimulus and post-stimulus recording to allow for proper
tegaserod administration via oral gavage. After the imaging was completed, mouse
abdomens were rewrapped in fresh vet wrap to prevent irritation. Only one
electrical recording session was performed every 2 days to allow the mouse to
recover between procedures.
Statistics. Healthy mice, between 6 and 12 weeks of age, were selected at random
for experiments. Each recording session (replicate) was conducted in a new animal
each time, except for chronic recording. Recordings were repeated in four different
animals for each chemical stimulation (acetylcholine, bethanechol, serotonin
or tegaserod), with a total of 20 recording sessions in distinct animals.
Recordings with TTX application were repeated in three different animals. Chronic
recordings were compared between responsive and non-responsive animals
recorded on days 1, 3 and 5. 470 nm stimulation experiments were repeated in four
NOS1-creERT2:Chr2 mice and four wild-type mice. P-values were determined using
paired, one-sided t-tests.
Data analysis. Electrical data were analysed in MATLAB to identify spikes.
For consistency between recordings, a lower threshold was determined using a
minimum signal-to-noise ratio. An upper threshold was also used to filter out
artefacts in the signal caused by violent perturbations because of stimulation. The
code was not changed between analyses of experiments to maintain consistency
and prevent bias.
Once spikes had been identified, the effect of each stimulant was determined by
calculating the percentage of spikes occurring before and after the stimulus in each
recording. For consistency, the time window being analysed before the stimulus is
the same length of time being analysed after the stimulus. This time window is at
least 2 min for all recordings.
Optical data were analysed in ImageJ software. Mean grey value was calculated
for regions containing dynamic GCaMP fluorescence. The mean grey value,
proportional to the amount of fluorescence, was used to determine the relative
activity level during the optical recording.
