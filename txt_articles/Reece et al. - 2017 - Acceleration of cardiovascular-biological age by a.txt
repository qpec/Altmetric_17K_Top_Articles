ABSTRACT
Background Amphetamine abuse is becoming more
widespread internationally. The possibility that its many
cardiovascular complications are associated with a
prematurely aged cardiovascular system, and indeed
biological organism systemically, has not been addressed.
Methods Radial arterial pulse tonometry was
performed using the SphygmoCor system (Sydney). 55
amphetamine exposed patients were compared with 107
tobacco smokers, 483 non-smokers and 68 methadone
patients (total=713 patients) from 2006 to 2011. A
cardiovascular-biological age (VA) was determined.
Results The age of the patient groups was 30.03
±0.51–40.45±1.15 years. This was controlled for with
linear regression. The sex ratio was the same in all
groups. 94% of amphetamine exposed patients had
used amphetamine in the previous week. When the (log)
VA was regressed against the chronological age (CA)
and a substance-type group in both cross-sectional and
longitudinal models, models quadratic in CA were
superior to linear models (both p<0.02). When log VA/
CA was regressed in a mixed effects model against time,
body mass index, CA and drug type, the cubic model
was superior to the linear model (p=0.001). Interactions
between CA, (CA)2 and (CA)3 on the one hand and
exposure type were significant from p=0.0120. The
effects of amphetamine exposure persisted after
adjustment for all known cardiovascular risk factors
(p<0.0001).
Conclusions These results show that subacute
exposure to amphetamines is associated with an
advancement of cardiovascular-organismal age both over
age and over time, and is robust to adjustment. That
this is associated with power functions of age implies a
feed-forward positively reinforcing exacerbation of the
underlying ageing process.
INTRODUCTION
With the use of psychostimulants increasing in
many countries to the particular concern of the
United Nations,1 further study of their pharmaco-
logical effects in a naturalistic environment is
timely. While amphetamines are best known for
their prominent clinical effects of neuropsychiatric
stimulation, they are also known to have stimulant
effects on other body systems. This is particularly
true of the cardiovascular system where they are
known to have many haemodynamic and patho-
logical effects including accelerated pulse rate,
increased central systolic pressure, increased central
pulse pressure, accelerated atherosclerosis including
coronary
atherosclerotic
disease,
hypertensive
crises, cerebrovascular accidents, ruptured cerebral
and thoracic arterial aneurysms, dissecting aneur-
ysms and many tachyarrythmias including sudden
cardiac death.2
The abuse of stimulants is presumably stressful
on the cardiovascular system over time. However
there are very few studies of such processes in
living humans. Widely publicised photographs of
stimulant abusers are well known to show very
rapid apparent ageing and such individuals died
soon after these photographs were taken (see http://
www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1475611/
Snapshots-from-hell-images-aimed-at-addicts.html).
The possibility exists then that the acute cardiovas-
cular events for which amphetamine is so well
known, do not occur de novo, but on the back-
ground of prior cardiovascular degeneration and
ageing. It may be that the crisis events occur in a
system already stressed and aged by prior sympa-
thetic overdrive and hyperadrenalism, just as is seen
in the changes in the skin. However there are few
studies of such changes in life.
Withdrawal from opioids is known to stimulate
the sympathoadrenal system, and to be associated
with adrenaline surges which may bear similarities
to those induced by exogenous abuse of stimulants.
Our group has previously documented the cardio-
vascular stress and parameters of increased central
augmented haemodynamic pressures experienced
by patients in opioid withdrawal.3 It may be there-
fore that psychostimulant abuse bears some similar-
ities
with
recurrent
opioid
withdrawal,
as
is
common among patients addicted to short-term
opioids.
The increasing measurement of in vivo arterial
stiffness, and its direct corollary cardiovascular age,
implies that such changes are measurable clinically.
As it is recognised that vascular age (VA) is the
primary
determinant
of
organismal
biological
age,4 5 the clinical and investigative power of these
studies is obviously considerable. This implies that
in addition to making measurements of central
haemodynamics, VA, as a major surrogate of organ-
ismal age,4 5 can also be derived concurrently.
As our clinic sees both general medical patients
along with patients addicted to stimulants and
opioids, and has access to the AtCor SphygmoCor
device for cardiovascular assessment, it was consid-
ered that we were ideally placed to investigate this
issue. Cocaine use is still rare in Australia, so that
the stimulant abusers seen in our clinic were users
of amphetamine derivatives, known on the street
as
‘Speed’,
‘Ice’
and
‘Ecstasy’.
The
following
documents our demonstration of accelerated cardio-
vascular ageing in patients with a recent and current

 history of amphetamine abuse, and is in accordance with the
concept that such patients are ageing their cardiovasculature
both subacutely and/or chronically. As no similar reports, to our
knowledge, are in existence, this is the first report of its type.
METHODS
Patient selection
Patients who reported amphetamine use were studied at the time
of their presentation to the clinic. Other patients were studied
opportunistically as they were seen for the usual medical man-
agement. Patients were not considered in the present analysis
with any condition which may have altered cardiovascular func-
tion. Hence patients with known cardiovascular disease, preg-
nancy, drug withdrawal, acutely affected by heroin or cannabis
or with acute infection were not included. Patients on metha-
done were considered separately as a comparator group. The
study was conducted during 2006–2011 in Brisbane, Australia.
Radial arterial pulse wave tonometry
Patients reclined quietly on a bed during the study. They were
not allowed to sleep, but were not prevented from smoking,
eating or drinking prior to the study. The brachial blood pres-
sure was taken with an Omron HEM-907 sphygmomanometer
usually on the left arm. The AtCor SphygmoCor system was
used to conduct the Radial Arterial Pulse W
ave Tonometry
(RAPWT) Study including a Miller micromanometer inside a
handheld probe. To be accepted studies were required to be
technically satisfactory and to have an Operator Index of 70 or
more. Studies were all performed in quintuplicate. Among the
many parameters produced by the system the software calculates
a VA reference age by an algorithm matching the degree of
arterial stiffening with age, sex and height.
Demographic and laboratory data
Patients were asked about their prior drug use at the time of the
performance of the pulse wave tonometry. When asked to quan-
tify their use of psychostimulants patients generally gave vague
and variable answers. Use was invariably quantified as ‘points’.
Frequency was often vague and highly variable such as once or
twice a week with many periods in and out of active use. The
clinical pathology testing for our clinic is done by Queensland
Medical Laboratories (QML). QML is accredited to both the
International
Laboratory
Standard
ISO-9001
and
by
the
National Association of T
esting Laboratories to Australian
Standard AS-15189.
Statistics
Data from the above sources were collated into a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet. Categorical data were studied with EpiInfo
7.1.4.0 from Centres for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia,
USA. Statistica 7.1 from Statsoft T
ulsa, Oklahoma, USA was
used to compute bivariate group differences. Student’s t-tests
were all two tailed. The statistical program ‘R’ was used to
compute multiple regression calculations. ‘R’ was downloaded
from the Cloud Central R Archive Network mirror and the
packages
base,
ggplot2,
reshape
and
nlme
were
used.
Continuous variables were log transformed as indicated by the
Shapiro test to comply with normality assumptions. Repeated
measures mixed effects models for time dependent variables
were employed using unity and the patient’s unique identified
code as random effects using Restricted Estimators of Maximum
Likelihood. Models were compared using analysis of variance
(ANOVA) methods. Mixed effects models were compared in
their maximum likelihood mode in ANOVA models. Missing
data were handled by casewise deletion. Initial models were
reduced by the classical method with successive deletion of the
least significant terms until only significant terms remained. A
value of p<0.05 was considered significant.
Ethics
Patients gave informed consent for the conduct of RAPWT and
for the inclusion of their anonymised data in the current deiden-
tified analysis. The Human Research Ethics Committee of the
Southcity Medical Centre gave formal ethical approval for the
study. This committee has been registered with the National
Health and Medical Research Council in Australia. The conduct
of the study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
RESULTS
As shown in table 1 this study reviewed 713 patients in four
groups. There were 483 in the non-smoking control group, 107
in the tobacco smoking group, 55 in the amphetamine group
and 68 in the methadone group. Methadone was included as a
positive control as has previously been described.6 These 713
patients were studied on 953 occasions as indicated in the table.
As shown in table 1 there were significant age differences
between the groups. However the sex ratios were not dissimilar.
The average buprenorphine dose among the amphetamine
patients was 12.42±4.87 mg and the average methadone dose
among the methadone exposed patients was 64.18±4.09 mg.
Other differences between the groups are shown in table 1.
It is of interest that the time since amphetamine use was also
noted. The mean period since amphetamine use was 5.8
±1.91 days (median 2 days, mode 1 day). Of the 66 occasions
on which RAPWT was performed and for which meaningful
responses to amphetamine use was obtained, 62 exposures
(93.9%) had occurred within the previous week, and 31 (47%)
had occurred the day prior.
Table 2 shows differences in the cardiovascular parameters
considered on a bivariate basis. The methadone group is noted
to have significantly advanced augmentation indices, but this is
partly related to their older age (table 1). The heart rate in the
stimulant patients is higher which also affects some of the
timing indices.
Online supplementary table S1 lists some of the clinical
laboratory differences between the groups.
Figure 1 shows various age related cardiovascular parameters
as a function of chronological age (CA). Figure 2 shows these
same parameters over time. Online supplementary figure S1
shows some of the other cardiovascular parameters as a function
of age and online supplementary figure S2 illustrates the same
group of factors over time.
In order to confirm that the amphetamine exposed patients
exhibited increased VA, linear regression was performed to
adjust for age. In the cross-sectional study linear regression was
performed of the VA against CA and the drug exposure cat-
egory. A model quadratic in CA was shown to fit the data better
than a linear model (residual sum of squares (RSS) 65.68 and
66.32, DF=1, F=6.203, p=0.013). The final model is shown in
the top part of table 3. A significant interaction between the
square of CA and amphetamine exposure is noted (p=0.0210).
The same question was considered in the longitudinal sample.
Again a model quadratic in age was a superior fit to the data com-
pared with a linear mixed effects model (akaike information cri-
terion
(AIC)=372.89
and
377.48,
likelihood
ratio=6.597,
p=0.0102). In this model, shown in the middle portion of
table 3, an interaction between age and amphetamine exposure
was again significant (p=0.0215). The issue was also investigated

Original research
 in the longitudinal study with mixed effects models by regressing
(log) V
A/CA against CA, time, body mass index (BMI) and drug
use status in models including polynomial terms in CA. The
model cubic in CA was noted to be better than the linear model
(AICs
303.734
and
311.085,
likelihood
ratio=39.34
and
p=0.001). As shown in the bottom portion of table 3, interactive
terms including amphetamines were significant with the square
and cube of CA from p=0.0120.
Because of the uncertainty and variability of the drug use his-
tories it was not possible to quantitate amphetamine use mean-
ingfully. Thus dose-response studies could not be calculated.
It was also of interest to examine the acute effect of time
since exposure on the VA/CA ratio. This relationship is shown
in figure 3 and in table 4. There was no direct correlation
between the log (VA/CA) (Spearman’s S=56 115, p=0.17), but
when this ratio was regressed there was a significant relationship
with the interaction between the CA and days since amphet-
amine (p=0.0296), and the days on the study, days since
amphetamine and CA which was of borderline significance, as
shown in the table 4.
It was nevertheless of interest to see how amphetamine expos-
ure when considered as a factor might interact with traditional
cardiovascular variables. This issue was considered in the longi-
tudinal data series by regressing the VA against a model inter-
active in age, BMI and drug status, with additive terms in
systolic pressure, cholesterol, diastolic pressure, high density
lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), heart rate
and high sensitivity CRP
. The data series could not handle more
interactions than were included in this model computationally.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), blood glucose levels, cre-
atine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were
included in exploratory models but as they were routinely
dropped early in the exclusion process of non-significant terms
during model reduction, they were not included in the initial
models which were finally adopted. An attempt was made to
include the buprenorphine dose in this regression but the model
failed to converge. The terms which remained significant in the
final model are shown in table 5. Amphetamine use as a factor
was found to be highly significant (p<0.0001), independent of
all known cardiovascular risk factors in this analysis.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that as measured with the SphygmoCor
cardiovascular monitoring system amphetamine abusers do
indeed appear to be ageing their cardiovascular system in a
more rapid manner with regard both to CA and over time
(figures 1 and 2 and table 3). The process seems to occur more
aggressively than with tobacco smoking. It appears to follow a
different time course to that of the positive methadone control
group. It was also shown that the VA/CA ratio declines with
time following amphetamine abuse, thereby showing that the
acute effects are significant. Of particular concern, when all
other known cardiovascular variables were included, amphet-
amine exposure remained significant.
Therefore the present results confirm our concerns that
amphetamine abuse increases the apparent cardiovascular age at
least following subacute exposure and given that the exposures
are often protracted, repeated and long-term, implies that the
organism is exposed to such effects at least on a behavioural
basis and also on a chronic and long-term basis. The technol-
ogy involved in pulse wave tonometry has been developed over
the last 20 years and has been reviewed in detail.7–9 The data
in this study are not of a type to distinguish fixed damage to
the vessel wall compared with increased vasomotor tone, so it
is not possible on this data alone to determine if the pathology
described is phasic and tonic in nature or static and fixed. From
a purely functional perspective this is a somewhat academic dis-
tinction as the recurrent nature of the cycles of repeated abuse
implies that the system is recurrently subject to severe physio-
logical insults.
From a broader perspective however, the present findings of
advanced cardiovascular age in association with stimulant use
implies, as described in the introduction, that the organism itself
is likely ageing in a more rapid manner. This direct implication
of our study is of real concern to all those tasked with protec-
tion of the public heath, and public health policy broadly. The
implication from the present work is that recurrent habitual
amphetamine abuse ages the cardiovasculature, and likely the
whole organism generally. It is therefore conceivable that stimu-
lant abusers do physiological and cardiovascular harm. There is
no similar body of data of which we are aware showing

 remediation of such damage. That is to say, it is not clear to
what extent such damage might be reversible.
It was particularly concerning that the best mixed effects
regression models consistently showed highly significant interac-
tions between CA and amphetamine exposure. The ageing
process itself naturally suggests a power function over time, as
many physiological processes fail progressively over the life
span. This implies that the effects of stimulant abuse may com-
pound with time, and may become more severe as time pro-
gresses and life passes by, which in turn implies that stimulants
compound and accelerate the normal time-dependent degener-
ation of physiological systems. If, as has been demonstrated, the
damage from stimulant abuse is actually a power function of
time, then this in turn implies that the gathering global stimu-
lant epidemic carries a further message of urgency which has
largely not been appreciated. It is a further motivation and
impetus for the development of new and novel treatments
perhaps including modafinil-class10 and naltrexone implants.
Opioid withdrawal is an analogus hyperadrenergic state,11 and a
similar powerful interactive effect has been demonstrated in that
condition with CA.3
Moreover since stem cells are richly supplied by their micro-
vasculature, and since the microvascular element plays several
key roles in stem cell niche function,4 5 12–14 it is further likely
that an impairment of microvascular functional activity may dir-
ectly age the stem cell generative niches from which most tissues
are renewed. Amphetamines have been shown to interfere with
stem cell processes in several tissue beds15 16 and to interfere
with the machinery of cell division.17 Hence amphetamines
both impede tissue repair and increase tissue injury through
heightened immune activation as noted below, which is a potent
negative double entendre and clearly likely to have a strongly
progeroid effect with important negative implications for pat-
terns of organismal ageing. Immune stimulation is known to

Given the known cardiovascular toxicity of amphetamine-
type stimulants, the present findings are in accordance with its
known pharmacopathological profile. The consistency of data
from the present report for an agent for which cardiovascular
toxicity
is
well
established
has
implications
for
the
implementation of this methodology beyond this study and
strengthens the proof of concept for use of this methodology
with other drugs of abuse, and indeed in other pathophysio-
logical
conditions.
Hence
the
current
report
substantially
strengthens earlier reports from our group relating to the
advanced cardiovascular, and by implication organismal ageing
associated with opioid dependency6 39 40 and also for cannabis
abuse.41
Our study is phenomenological and observational rather than
mechanistic in its orientation which makes it difficult to dissect
possible cellular pathways and processes from the data provided
in the present report. As noted above, nephrotoxic and hyper-
glycaemic mechanisms seem unlikely from our regression data
and they are not implicated in the bivariate between-group com-
parison data provided in online supplementary table S1. Innate

 and adaptive immune processes have been heavily implicated by
multiple reports both in atherogenesis4 5 42–44 and ageing.45–47
Immune stimulation has also been noted to result from amphe-
tamines by several authors35 48–52 as has amphetamine-induced
hepatoxicity.53–56 The latter appears to be related in part to
drug metabolism within the liver and the derivation of reactive
metabolites. Moreover the bivariate comparison data in online
supplementary table S1 do show significant between-group dif-
ferences for the control and amphetamine groups in white cell
count, absolute lymphocyte count, serum globulins and all the
liver enzymes. However none of these markers survived model
reduction when they were included in regression models. Hence
the data provided herein are consistent with generalised activa-
tion of immune-metabolic processes underlying the observed
acceleration of both atherosclerotic and ageing processes in
amphetamine dependence. However formal demonstration of
such mechanisms would have to await further prospective clin-
ical studies and detailed explorations in model organisms.
This study has several strengths and some limitations which
should be borne in mind. Strengths of the study include the
direct comparison of drug dependent patients and normal con-
trols within a single centre. Moreover several drug dependencies
were available for comparison including tobacco, amphetamine
and methadone. There are no other addiction medical clinics
routinely applying central cardiovascular monitoring, to our
knowledge, so this is also a strength. Moreover some sophisti-
cated statistical modelling procedures have been employed in
the data analysis phase which also supports the overall conclu-
sions. Another study strength was the high degree of uniformity
of the sex ratio between all four groups. Study weaknesses
include the unavailability of dosing data which precluded the
calculation of dose-response computations, and the lack of drug
screening at the time of cardiovascular testing. As our sample
size is not very large this would tend to limit the generalisability
of our results somewhat. These issues represent refinements
which could be addressed in future repetitions or replications of
the study.
In conclusion this study has documented evidence of acceler-
ated cardiovascular ageing in frequent users of amphetamines
both over time and as a function of age which are consistent
with either a subacute or subacute-on-chronic origin. It is of
great concern that cardiovascular age relates directly to organis-
mal age thereby implying accelerated biological ageing at the
organismal level. These findings likely have implications at the
macrovascular and microvascular, including stem cell, levels,
given the widely recognise dependence of stem cell niches on
microvascular activity and health. The present study reinforces
the strength of similar studies with other dependency syndromes
by strengthening the proof of concept of the methodology
employed. It has also been shown that the ageing-accelerant
effects of stimulant exposure are a power function of CA, with
terms including interactions with the square and cube of CA
reaching high levels of statistical significance. These findings
therefore lend significance and a real sense of urgency to
address the global psychostimulant epidemic and the swathe of

Key messages
What is already known about this subject?
Amphetamine abuse is well known to be causally associated
with numerous major cardiovascular complications.
What does this study add?
We confirmed increased cardiovascular-biological age with
amphetamine use in men and women, robust to adjustment for
known cardiovascular risk factors, with effects beyond simply
those due to acute exposure, and related to power functions
(square and cubic functions) of chronological age.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
These findings confirm that amphetamine abuse is associated
with acceleration of the organismal-biological age and the
relationship with power functions of chronological age implies a
feed-forward accelerating compounding relationship which
underlies and exacerbates its cardiovascular and other toxicities.
These findings imply an acceleration of the ageing process
underlying the known described pathologies, and enhance our
understanding of the nature of the human toxicology of
amphetamine dependence.
