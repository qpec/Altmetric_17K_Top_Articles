BACKGROUND
The cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor evacetrapib substantially raises the 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, reduces the low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol level, and enhances cellular cholesterol efflux capacity. We sought 
to determine the effect of evacetrapib on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in 
patients with high-risk vascular disease.
METHODS
In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, we en-
rolled 12,092 patients who had at least one of the following conditions: an acute 
coronary syndrome within the previous 30 to 365 days, cerebrovascular atheroscle-
rotic disease, peripheral vascular arterial disease, or diabetes mellitus with coronary 
artery disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either evacetrapib at a 
dose of 130 mg or matching placebo, administered daily, in addition to standard 
medical therapy. The primary efficacy end point was the first occurrence of any 
component of the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina.
RESULTS
At 3 months, a 31.1% decrease in the mean LDL cholesterol level was observed with 
evacetrapib versus a 6.0% increase with placebo, and a 133.2% increase in the mean 
HDL cholesterol level was seen with evacetrapib versus a 1.6% increase with placebo. 
After 1363 of the planned 1670 primary end-point events had occurred, the data and 
safety monitoring board recommended that the trial be terminated early because of 
a lack of efficacy. After a median of 26 months of evacetrapib or placebo, a primary 
end-point event occurred in 12.9% of the patients in the evacetrapib group and in 
12.8% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 
0.91 to 1.11; P 
= 
0.91).
CONCLUSIONS
Although the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor evacetrapib had favorable 
effects on established lipid biomarkers, treatment with evacetrapib did not result in a 
lower rate of cardiovascular events than placebo among patients with high-risk vascular 
disease. (Funded by Eli Lilly; ACCELERATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01687998.)

harmacologic reduction of the low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level 
with statins substantially decreases the risks 
of death and complications from cardiovascular 
causes.1,2 Considerable interest has focused on the 
identification of approaches that might further re-
duce cardiovascular-event rates among high-risk 
patients.3 Epidemiologic studies have shown in-
verse associations between high-density lipopro-
tein (HDL) cholesterol levels and cardiovascular 
outcomes,4-6 a correlation that persists despite 
treatment with statins.7 Nevertheless, therapeu-
tic interventions that raise the HDL cholesterol 
level have not been shown to reduce cardiovas-
cular risk.
Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mod-
ulates the transfer of esterified cholesterol from 
HDL to apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins.8 
Two drugs that inhibit CETP were evaluated pre-
viously in trials that assessed cardiovascular out-
comes. Treatment with one of these drugs, torce-
trapib, in combination with atorvastatin, increased 
HDL cholesterol levels by approximately 70% from 
baseline and reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 25% 
but was associated with higher rates of death and 
cardiovascular events than the rates with atorva-
statin alone, a finding that was thought to be a 
result of off-target toxic effects (increased blood 
pressure and increased plasma levels of aldoste-
rone).9 Treatment with the second drug, dalce-
trapib, did not result in a lower rate of cardiovas-
cular events than placebo among patients with a 
recent acute coronary syndrome, but it increased 
HDL cholesterol levels by only 30% from baseline 
and had no effect on LDL cholesterol levels.10 
Thus, the hypothesis that a potent CETP inhibitor 
might reduce the risk of cardiovascular events 
has not been tested definitively.
Evacetrapib is a CETP inhibitor with no evi-
dence of torcetrapib-like off-target effects. In a 
phase 2 trial, evacetrapib increased HDL choles-
terol levels by as much as 130% from baseline and 
reduced LDL cholesterol levels by nearly 35%.11 
In the Assessment of Clinical Effects of Choles-
teryl Ester Transfer Protein Inhibition with Eva-
cetrapib in Patients at a High Risk for Vascular 
Outcomes (ACCELERATE) trial, we tested the hy-
pothesis that the addition of evacetrapib to stan-
dard medical therapy would result in a lower risk 
of death or complications from cardiovascular 
causes than placebo among patients with high-risk 
vascular disease.
Methods
Trial Design and Organization
We conducted this multicenter, randomized, dou-
ble-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 event-driven 
trial at 543 sites in 36 countries. The trial design 
has been described previously.12 The trial was 
sponsored by Eli Lilly and was coordinated by the 
Cleveland Clinic Coordinating Center for Clinical 
Research (C5Research) and Covance (Princeton, 
NJ). The trial protocol, which is available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org, was designed 
by the sponsor and the executive committee. The 
appropriate national and institutional regulatory 
and ethics boards approved the protocol. All the 
patients provided written informed consent.
The executive committee, together with phy-
sician national coordinators from each involved 
country, were responsible for the scientific con-
duct of the trial. An independent data and safety 
monitoring board had access to unblinded data. 
The sponsor shared responsibility for site selection, 
trial oversight, data collection, and regulatory over-
sight with C5Research and Covance. The clinical 
database was maintained by Covance and was 
subsequently transferred to C5Research for inde-
pendent statistical analysis.
The first author wrote the first version of the 
manuscript and made revisions on the basis of 
input from the coauthors, including authors who 
were employees of the sponsor. The sponsor had 
no role in the decision to submit the manuscript 
for publication. All the authors vouch for the com-
pleteness and accuracy of the data and all analyses 
and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.
Trial Population
Patients were eligible for enrollment in the trial 
if they were 18 years of age or older and had high-
risk vascular disease, which was defined as the 
presence of at least one of the following condi-
tions: an acute coronary syndrome within the 
previous 30 to 365 days, cerebrovascular athero-
sclerotic disease, peripheral vascular arterial dis-
ease, or diabetes mellitus with coronary artery 
disease. Patients had to have been treated with a 
statin for at least 30 days before screening, unless 
they had documented unacceptable side effects 
from statins or had a contraindication to statins. 
Patients were required to have an HDL cholesterol 
level of less than 80 mg per deciliter (2.10 mmol 
per liter) and a triglyceride level of less than 400 mg

per deciliter (4.52 mmol per liter). The LDL choles-
terol levels at enrollment were to be no more than 
10 mg per deciliter (0.25 mmol per liter) above 
target levels that were specified at the investigator’s 
discretion (a target LDL cholesterol level of <100 mg 
per deciliter [2.60 mmol per liter] or <70 mg per 
deciliter [1.80 mmol per liter]), unless the patient 
had already been receiving a maximum tolerated 
dose of statin for at least 30 days, had documented 
unacceptable side effects from statins, or had a 
contraindication to statin therapy. Key exclusion 
criteria were an acute coronary syndrome, stroke, 
or transient ischemic attack that had occurred 
within the previous 30 days or planned coronary 
angiography or revascularization. Full details of the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.
Trial Regimen
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 
with the use of an interactive voice-response sys-
tem to receive evacetrapib at an oral dose of 130 
mg or matching placebo, administered daily, in 
addition to standard, guideline-based care for 
high-risk vascular disease and its risk factors. To 
avoid unblinding due to the anticipated effects 
of evacetrapib on lipid levels, the trial team re-
mained unaware of the patients’ lipid profiles, 
which were measured at a central laboratory. Al-
though the investigators were generally not in-
formed of the results of lipid testing at the central 
laboratory and lipid levels were not to be measured 
at local laboratories, investigators were informed if 
the LDL cholesterol levels exceeded specified tar-
gets to allow adjustment of lipid-lowering therapies.
End Points
The primary efficacy end point was the first occur-
rence of any component of the composite of death 
from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitaliza-
tion for unstable angina. Secondary efficacy end 
points, which were to be tested hierarchically, in-
cluded the mean percent change from baseline in 
the HDL cholesterol level and the LDL cholesterol 
level at 3 months; the composite of death from 
cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or 
stroke; all-cause mortality; and individual compo-
nents of the primary efficacy end point. Specific 
safety measures included pulse; blood pressure; 
and adverse events, including laboratory markers 
of muscle injury or renal injury. An independent 
clinical-events committee, whose members were 
unaware of the trial-group assignments, adjudi-
cated the end points of death, myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, coronary revascularization, and hospi-
talization for unstable angina. Definitions of the 
components of the primary end point are provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated an annual event rate of 5% for the 
primary end point in the placebo group on the 
basis of data from trials involving similar popula-
tions.9,13-16 Under this assumption, we estimated 
that a sample of 12,000 patients, with an average 
of 3 years of follow-up, would provide the trial 
with 84% power to detect a risk of a composite 
end-point event that was 13.5% lower with evace-
trapib than with placebo, using a log-rank test at 
a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 (additional details 
regarding the calculation of the sample size are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
trial was to continue until all three of the follow-
ing criteria were met: at least 1670 adjudicated 
primary composite end-point events had oc-
curred; at least 700 adjudicated secondary com-
posite end-point events of death from cardiovas-
cular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke had 
occurred; and at least 1.5 years had elapsed since 
the last patient underwent randomization.
No interim analysis for superiority was planned. 
A futility assessment was to be performed by the 
data and safety monitoring board after the adju-
dication of approximately 75% of the targeted 
composite end-point events, at which time the 
board could recommend that the trial be stopped 
early if the conditional power for a significant 
between-group difference in the risk of a com-
posite end-point event at a two-sided alpha level 
of 0.05 by the end of the trial was less than 5%.
Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat 
population, which included all the patients who 
underwent randomization. Data from patients who 
withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up were 
censored at the time of withdrawal or at the time 
that the patient was last known to be free from 
having a composite end-point event. Kaplan–Meier 
time-to-event plots were constructed for clinical 
events, and clinical-event rates were summarized 
according to trial regimen. The trial regimens were 
compared with the use of a log-rank test. If the 
analysis of the primary end point showed that 
treatment with evacetrapib was associated with

a risk of a composite end-point event that was 
lower than the risk with placebo, secondary ef-
ficacy end points were subsequently to be evalu-
ated hierarchically, guided by a gatekeeping test-
ing strategy, with each hypothesis evaluated at a 
two-sided significance level of 0.05.
Results
Randomization, Characteristics of the 
Patients, and Follow-up
From October 2012 through December 2013, a 
total of 12,092 patients underwent randomization; 
6038 patients were assigned to receive evacetrapib 
and 6054 to receive placebo (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The demographic and clinical 
characteristics of the patients at baseline are sum-
marized in Table 1. Approximately one third of the 
patients had had a recent acute coronary syndrome 
at a median of 5.6 months before randomization. 
More than 96% of the patients were receiving 
statin therapy at the time of randomization, and 
46% were receiving a high-intensity statin, as de-
fined according to current guidelines.17 The mean 
baseline level of HDL cholesterol was 45.3 mg per 
deciliter (1.17 mmol per liter), and the mean base-
line level of LDL cholesterol was 81.3 mg per deci-
liter (2.10 mmol per liter).
The data and safety monitoring board con-
ducted an interim analysis for futility on October 
7, 2015, after 1363 primary composite end-point 
events had been observed (82% of the expected 
number of events for the final analysis). A total of 
691 events had occurred in the evacetrapib group 
and 672 in the placebo group (hazard ratio for a 
composite end-point event with evacetrapib vs. 
placebo, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93 to 
1.15; P 
= 
0.58). On the basis of these findings, the 
data and safety monitoring board recommended 
that the trial be stopped for futility. Both the ex-
ecutive committee and the sponsor accepted this 
recommendation, and the trial was terminated on 
October 12, 2015. At the completion of follow-up 
and the finalization of the trial database on April 
6, 2016, a total of 1555 adjudicated primary end-
point events had occurred (93% of the expected 
number of events for the final analysis).
The median overall duration of follow-up was 
28 months (interquartile range, 26 to 30). Patients 
received their trial regimen for a median of 26 
months (interquartile range, 23 to 29). Fewer pa-
tients discontinued the trial regimen prematurely 
in the evacetrapib group than in the placebo group 
(1025 patients [17.0%] vs. 1139 [18.8%], P 
= 
0.02) 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Complete 
end-point information was available for 11,860 
patients (98.1%). Final vital status was unknown 
for 40 patients (0.3%), of whom 16 (0.1%) were lost 
to follow-up and 24 (0.2%) withdrew consent.
Trial Outcomes and Lipid Levels
Changes in lipoprotein levels over the course of 
the trial are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2. At 
 
3 months, patients who received evacetrapib had 
a mean percent increase from baseline in the 
HDL cholesterol level of 133.2%, as compared 
with a mean percent increase of 1.6% that was 
observed in patients who received placebo (be-
tween-group difference, 131.6 percentage points; 
95% CI, 130.0 to 133.1; P<0.001). The mean LDL 
cholesterol level decreased by 31.1% in the evace-
trapib group and increased by 6.0% in the place-
bo group (between-group difference, −37.1 per-
centage points; 95% CI, −38.1 to −36.1; P<0.001).
A primary efficacy end-point event of the com-
posite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocar-
dial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, 
or hospitalization for unstable angina occurred in 
779 patients (12.9%) in the evacetrapib group and 
in 776 (12.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 
1.01; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.11; P 
= 
0.91) (Fig. 2 and Ta-
ble 2). Because no significant difference was ob-
served for the primary end point, the analyses of 
the secondary outcomes were considered to be ex-
ploratory (Table 2, and Figs. S3, S4, and S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). A secondary end-point 
event of the composite of death from cardiovascular 
causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 
437 patients (7.2%) in the evacetrapib group and in 
453 (7.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.97; 
95% CI, 0.85 to 1.10; P 
= 
0.59). The incidence of 
death from any cause (unadjusted for multiple com-
parisons) was significantly lower with evacetrapib 
than with placebo (P 
= 
0.04). No significant differ-
ences in the rates of other efficacy end points were 
observed between the two groups. No clinically 
relevant differences were observed between the two 
trial groups among prespecified subgroups in the 
intention-to-treat population that were defined ac-
cording to baseline clinical characteristics, baseline 
lipid levels, or concomitant lipid-lowering thera-
pies (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).

in the systolic blood pressure was slightly great-
er in the evacetrapib group than in the placebo 
group (1.2±14.4 mm Hg vs. 0±14.3 mm Hg, 
P<0.001). The median percent increase from 
baseline in the level of high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein was greater in the evacetrapib group than 
in the placebo group (8.6% [interquartile range, 
−27.0 to 63.3] vs. 0% [interquartile range, −32.1 to 
52.4], P<0.001). A lower percentage of patients in 
the evacetrapib group than in the placebo group 
had an increase in the creatine kinase level of 
3 or more times the upper limit of the normal 
range (2.4% vs. 3.1%). There were no other clini-
cally relevant differences between the two trial 
groups with respect to safety variables.
Discussion
The ACCELERATE trial evaluated whether the 
potent inhibition of CETP by evacetrapib, when 
added to standard-of-care therapy in patients with 
high-risk vascular disease, would improve long-
term cardiovascular outcomes. Evacetrapib was 
associated with a mean decrease in the LDL 
cholesterol level that was 37.1 percentage points 
greater than the change with placebo and with 
a mean increase in the HDL cholesterol level that 
was 131.6 percentage points greater than the 
increase with placebo. Despite these favorable 
changes in the lipoprotein levels, treatment with 
evacetrapib did not result in a lower risk of death 
from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hos-
pitalization for unstable angina.
Several lines of evidence have provided a ratio-
nale for the idea that pharmacologic inhibition of 
CETP might reduce the risk of cardiovascular 
outcomes. Epidemiologic studies consistently cor-
relate higher HDL cholesterol levels with fewer 
cardiovascular events.4-7 Genetic polymorphisms 
that reduce CETP activity increase HDL choles-
terol levels and have been associated with lower 
risks of cardiovascular outcomes in some, but not 
all, studies.18-21 Pharmacologic inhibition of CETP 
in animal models that express this protein has 
been shown to reduce atherosclerosis.22 Previous 
clinical investigations have not adequately tested 
this treatment strategy. Treatment with torcetra-
pib was limited by off-target toxic effects that 
led to higher blood pressure and worse cardiovas-
cular outcomes than were observed in the placebo 
group.9 Treatment with dalcetrapib resulted in only 
small increases in the HDL cholesterol level and 
had no effect on the LDL cholesterol level.10
We had anticipated that the marked effects of 
evacetrapib on lipid levels would position the 
ACCELERATE trial to assess decisively the effect 
of CETP inhibition on clinical outcomes. In a

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
phase 2 trial, evacetrapib was associated with an 
increase from baseline in the HDL cholesterol 
level of as much as 130% and with a decrease in 
the LDL cholesterol level of nearly 35%,11 chang-
es that were similar to those seen in our trial. The 
changes in the HDL cholesterol levels included 
an increase in lipid-depleted pre-beta HDL par-
ticles.23 Treatment with evacetrapib in a phase 2 
trial also resulted in an increase in cellular cho-
lesterol efflux capacity by means of ATP-binding 
cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and non-ABCA1 
mechanisms.23 The negative results of the current 
trial therefore reinforce the principle that biologic 
plausibility and beneficial effects on surrogate end 
points do not obviate the need for adequately pow-
ered outcome trials of new therapeutic agents.
Several explanations are possible as to why 
evacetrapib did not result in a lower risk of cardio-
vascular events than placebo in this trial. Epide-
miologic associations between the HDL choles-
terol level and the risk of cardiovascular events 
have been observed primarily in patients who 
were healthy initially. Beneficial vascular effects 
of HDL particles, such as cholesterol efflux capac-
ity, may be attenuated in patients who have coro-
nary artery disease or acute coronary syndromes, 
as compared with healthy trial participants, and 
a number of mechanisms have been proposed 
regarding the possible causes of such HDL dys-
function.24,25 Alternatively, some clinicians have 
expressed concern that the inhibition of CETP 
pathways may produce HDL particles that are 
dysfunctional,26 although the protective effects of 
genetic loss-of-function polymorphisms of CETP 
do not support this hypothesis. The profile of 
change in HDL lipid particles and the enhance-
ment of cellular cholesterol efflux with evacetra-
pib suggest that the HDL cholesterol produced by 
this agent should be functional, but this concept 
of functionality27,28 has yet to be validated as a 
predictor of therapeutic benefit. Moreover, HDL 
particles possess other properties that are thought 
to be vasoprotective,24 and the effect of CETP in-
hibition on these properties is unknown.
Even if HDL cholesterol is dismissed as a 
modifiable risk factor in patients with vascular 
disease, it is surprising that the decrease of 37 
percentage points in the LDL cholesterol level that 
was observed with evacetrapib, as compared with 
placebo, in this trial did not result in a beneficial 
effect on cardiovascular events. This magnitude 
of reduction in the LDL cholesterol level is com-
mensurate with the magnitude that has been 
observed with moderate-intensity statin therapy 
and that would be expected to produce an ap-
proximately 15% lower risk of major coronary 
events.2 It is conceivable that mechanisms of reduc-
tion in the LDL cholesterol level that are specific to 
CETP inhibition, in contrast to the LDL cholester-
ol–receptor up-regulation that is induced by 
statins and ezetimibe, affect LDL cholesterol in 
ways that do not influence cardiovascular risk. 
Although treatment with evacetrapib has result-
ed in reductions of 60 to 70% in the levels of 
small dense LDL particles,29 effects on the total 
number of LDL particles and on apolipoprotein 
B levels (reductions of 22% and 20%, respec-
tively) are considerably less pronounced. The ef-
fect on the atherogenicity of the polydisperse LDL 
cholesterol pattern in association with CETP defi-
ciency or inhibition remains unknown.30
We cannot exclude the possibility that CETP 
inhibition or evacetrapib itself produced an unmea-
sured toxic effect that offset the beneficial lipid 
effects. The observed mean increase in systolic 
blood pressure that was associated with evacetra-
pib in this trial (1.2 mm Hg) was small as com-
pared with the increase of 5.4 mm Hg that was 
induced by torcetrapib in an earlier trial9 and

Evacetrapib and Outcomes in Vascular Disease
was unlikely to be of sufficient magnitude to 
worsen cardiovascular outcomes directly. Never-
theless, this finding may be a marker of more 
profound adverse neuroendocrine or vasomotor 
effects. Similarly, patients who received evacetra-
pib had a slight increase in the level of C-reactive 
protein, which, although small, contrasts with the 
effects of statins31 and may signal heightened in-
flammatory responses to CETP inhibition.
The 2-year duration of treatment with evace-
trapib in this trial may have been insufficient to 
show a benefit of lipid modification by means of 
CETP inhibition. However, previous trials of statins 
in high-risk patients have shown a divergence of 
time-to-event curves as early as 3 to 6 months 
after the initiation of therapy,14,32-34 and the 24% 
reduction in the LDL cholesterol level that was 
associated with ezetimibe was reflected in a di-
vergence of survival curves by 1 year.35 In contrast, 
time-to-event curves showed no hint of separation 
over the course of the entire 26-month follow-up of 
the current trial. Thus, it seems unlikely that a 
beneficial effect of evacetrapib would have been 
revealed if treatment had been continued for a 
longer period.
In conclusion, we compared evacetrapib with 
placebo in patients who had high-risk vascular 
disease. Treatment with evacetrapib was associ-
ated with an increase in the HDL cholesterol level 
and a reduction in the LDL cholesterol level that 
were both significant and substantial, but evace-
trapib treatment did not have a beneficial effect 
on cardiovascular outcomes.
