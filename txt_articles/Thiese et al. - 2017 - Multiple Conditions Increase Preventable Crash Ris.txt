Abstract
Objective—This study aims to quantify the crash risk for truck drivers with multiple comorbid 
medical conditions, after adjusting for confounders.
Methods—This retrospective cohort of 38,184 drivers evaluated concomitant medical conditions 
and subsequent crash data between 1/1/2005–10/31/2012. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for any cause and preventable crashes of varying 
severity.
Results—Drivers with three or more medical conditions had significantly increased risk of 
preventable Department of Transportation (DOT) reportable crashes (HR=2.53, 95% CI=1.65–
3.88) and preventable crashes with injuries (HR=2.23, 95% CI=1.09–5.31) after adjustment for 
covariates. Similarly, adjusted HRs were 2.55 (95% CI=1.37–4.73) for any cause DOT-reportable 
crashes and 3.21 (95% CI=1.18–8.75) for any cause crashes with injuries.
Conclusions—Having three concomitant medical conditions may be a statistically significant 
risk factor for preventable and any cause DOT-reportable crashes and crashes with injuries.

 Introduction
Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) drivers constitute one of the largest employment 
categories in the United States with an estimated 5.7 million CMV drivers, most of whom 
drive trucks.(1) Truck driving is also hazardous, as heavy and tractor trailer truck drivers in 
the US incurred 22.0 fatal injuries per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in 2013, as 
compared to 3.4 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers across all industries.(2) Every 
year since records were kept in 1975 through 2014, there has been an more than 3,100 large-
truck crash fatalities in the US, with an upward trend over the past 5 years. (1, 3) 
Approximately 60,000 truck crashes with injuries were reported to the police over the past 5 
years with an average cost per crash with injuries estimated to be between $331,000 and 
$533,000 and the average cost per crash involving a fatality between $7.2 and $11.7 million.
(1, 3) It is estimated that 1,000 of the 3,700 yearly fatal truck crashes are believed to be due 
to the fault of the CMV driver, rather than another vehicle.(4) Some studies suggest these 
statistics are likely underestimates.(5–7)
CMV drivers are an understudied (8) and medically underserved (9) population, often 
lacking regular healthcare providers, having poor access to healthcare services and 
frequently relying on emergency rooms and urgent care centers. A recent systematic review 
of health promotion interventions among CMV drivers also concluded that they are currently 
an underserved occupational group in terms of healthcare and health promotion efforts 
which consistently has high rates of obesity and related co-morbidities.(10) CMV drivers 
with chronic medical conditions may present public safety concerns due to: (1) the size and 
speed of their vehicles, (11, 12) (2) the frequently poor functional status of these drivers, 
(11–14) (3), CMV driver’s poor utilization of the traditional health care system (11–13) and 
(4) the large numbers and severe impacts of truck crashes on public health and safety.(11, 
12) While compared to total crashes, the frequency of truck crashes is relatively low, 
however, crashes involving trucks are generally more severe.(4)
Commercial Driver Health and Safety
U.S. CMV drivers are required by Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) 
regulations to obtain medical examinations at least every 2 years in order to maintain their 
commercial driver’s licenses. In spite of these required medical exams for licensure, 
commercial drivers have some of the highest rates of chronic diseases, occupational 
fatalities, and occupational injuries compared with other working populations.(15–23) While 
there are relatively few studies that have examined the association between crash risk and 
multiple medical condtions among CMV drivers, some published data have indicated an 
increased crash risk among obese CMV drivers.,(24, 25) cardiovascular disease,(15, 16, 26, 
27) diabetes,(28) medication use, (29, 30), and sleep apnea.(31–33) One analysis reported 
that obese CMV drivers [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2] have a significantly higher 
crash rate (>2.0 times) than non-obese CMV drivers.(24) Another study found associations 
with obesity and crashes among newly recruited CMV drivers.(34)
The poor health status of CMV drivers is commonly attributed to lifestyle (improper diet, 
inadequate physical activity, and poor sleep hygiene) and work environmental factors, 
although few data are available to understand the relative importance of these factors.(35–

 38) Combinations of medical conditions and/or medication use by drivers are suspected to 
increase their risk of being involved in crashes, however, there are no trucking-related data 
reported in this regard. (39) The only published study evaluating multiple medical conditions 
for drivers focused on general population, non-commercial drivers and found significantly 
increasing risks for crashes with increasing numbers of conditions.(40)
We hypothesized that there is an increased risk of preventable crashes among CMV drivers 
with multiple medical conditions in a large retrospective cohort after adjustments for 
confounding factors.
Methods
This study was approved by the University of Utah (IRB #35889) Institutional Review 
Board. This research linked two data sources using the driver’s commercial driver license 
number, to investigate relationships between personal and environmental risk factors, and 
interactions between these factors, while controlling for covariates.
Data Sources
Commercial Driver Medical Exam (CDME) methods for this study have been previously 
described (41, 42)and thus are only briefly described below. 25,36 Road Ready’s database is 
a large commercially-maintained dataset of CDMEs on drivers whose employers obtain 
CDMEs within the Road Ready network. The database includes CDMEs performed by 
numerous examiners on CMV drivers licensed in all 48 continental US states. Drivers are 
similar in health profiles (e.g. BMI, age, blood pressure, diabetes mellitus prevalence, etc.) 
to the overall truck driving population with an employer mix that includes private carriers, 
independent owner/operator drivers, and leased drivers for private carriers.(9, 15, 16, 20, 23, 
43–48)
CDME, employment and crash data from January 1, 2005 to October 31, 2012 were 
analyzed. Data from before and after these times were not available. Data elements included: 
demographics (age and gender), medical history (e.g., neurological problems, medications, 
sleep disorders, diabetes mellitus), measured height, measured weight, calculated body mass 
index, blood pressure, heart rate, urinalysis, and other medical exams (e.g., vision, 
cardiovascular, hearing whisper test). For the present investigation, if drivers had multiple 
CDMEs in the 2005–2012 timeframe, only the first CDME was analyzed. CDMEs from the 
database were then further restricted to those of drivers from a single large trucking firm in 
order to match medical information with detailed crash data that would allow for the 
calculation of accurate estimates of crash risks (see below).
A large U.S. truck company’s database (n~15,000 current drivers, n~70,000 drivers over the 
past 35 years) was accessed under a non-disclosure agreement. Company data included 
miles driven, segments driven, driving tenure, vehicle type, and all reported crashes 
involving the drivers.

 Risk Factors
This study used the FMCSA Medical Review Board’s (MRB) multiple conditions matrix to 
assign drivers to risk groups (left column of Table 1). The purpose of the matrix is to provide 
guidance regarding CMV driver certification length based on combinations of concomitant 
diseases and consensus opinion regarding increased risk for CMV crashes. Where exact 
matrix data were unavailable, comparable data were used for most elements from the CDME 
(right column of Table 1). As specified by the FMCSA MRB, the thirteen conditions are 
equally weighted within this matrix and were tallied to represent the number of medical 
conditions present for these analyses. This tool was selected as the primary measure because 
it is the only tool designed categorize drivers according to multiple concomitant conditions, 
with the presumption that there is an increased crash risk with increasing number of 
conditions. The temporal relationship between concomitant medical conditions and crashes 
has not been demonstrated.
Crash Occurrence and Outcomes
Crash data were accessed and the date of the crash was the event date. We considered only 
those crashes occurring subsequent to the CDME. The available crash data have multiple 
crash outcomes: 1) any crash, 2) DOT-reportable crash, and 3) DOT-reportable crash 
resulting in injuries. A crash of any severity was defined by the company as “any time the 
vehicle comes in contact with any other vehicle, object, person, animal, or property causing 
damage or injury or any allegation of contact or involvement in any manner, however 
minor.” DOT-reportable crashes are a subset of total crashes where either: A) there is a 
fatality, B) one or more persons receives medical treatment away from the site of the crash 
as a result of injuries sustained from the crash, and/or C) where one or more vehicle(s) are 
towed from the scene. The most severe crash outcome evaluated is defined as a DOT-
reportable crash resulting in either an injury or fatality. Consistent with other large programs 
in the industry, the company in this study has a crash investigation team that investigates all 
crashes and determines if the crash was or was not preventable. The determination is made 
by the company based on driver interviews, police reports, and other data. Preventable 
crashes are those crashes where the determination is that the crash could have been averted 
with driver action. Thus, all three crash outcomes were assessed in groups consisting of 
either preventable crashes, as well as in total (all crashes: both preventable and not 
preventable).
Covariates
Multiple covariates were assessed and adjusted for in the multivariable models (explained in 
the next section), including age, and gender, body mass index (BMI). Hazard ratios were 
also adjusted for: 1) length of medical certification, 2) reported narcotic or habit forming 
drug use, 3) if a drug test was performed at the time of the crash, 4) diagnosed muscular 
disease, 5) seat belt use at the time of the crash, 6) seizure history and 7) estimated impact 
speed of the crash. These were selected a priori based on potential for relationships with 
increasing number of medical conditions or increased severity of a crash.

 Statistical Analyses
Analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary NC, USA). Data were 
analyzed between 3/1/2015–3/28/16. Time-to-event data were available for all drivers. For 
those drivers not involved in a crash, theirhis or her last observation date in the study was the 
later of either a) the last date employed by the trucking company or b) the date his or her 
CDL was revoked due to a failed subsequent CDME. The latter criterion was also the same 
criterion for those with either single or multiple examinations. Time was calculated as the 
number of days between the exam and either crash or termination from the company. The 
analyses resulted in an estimated crash risk and adjusted hazard ratio for potential individual 
and environmental risk factors.
This study’s unit of analysis is a single crash, with additional analyses of repeated crashes as 
separate observations. The outcomes are binary (e.g., crash vs. no crash). The main analyses 
were analyses of the recurrent (repeated) time-to-event data using the Prentice, Williams, 
Peterson (1981) conditional risk set model (under the proportional hazard) for ordered 
failure events.
In initial univariate analysis, the continuous variables (e.g., age and BMI) were assessed for 
linearity. When adjusting for confounder effects, we carefully assessed potential co-linearity 
between predictors. Model fit were assessed using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms 
and numerical integration using adaptive quadrature methods. Variables included in the 
model were selected a priori based on factors thought to influence crash and severity risk. 
The analysis plan was created prior to linking the data and evaluating relationships. All tests 
are two-sided, a p-value less than 0.05 indicates the statistically significant result. Missing 
data were excluded from analyses.
Results
There were 38,184 drivers (49,464 records) in the RR database who also had a driving 
record from the large truck company. There were 13,472 total crashes and 10,350 
preventable crashes among these 38,184 drivers. The driver level descriptive statistics are 
provided in Table 2.
Any Crash
Among combined crashes of any severity, which includes minor crashes where no vehicles 
were towed, drivers having 4 or more medical conditions were significantly more likely to 
be involved in a crash (Table 3). A Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve (Figure 1) visually 
demonstrates the difference in probability of being crash-free between drivers with 
increasing number of multiple medical conditions. Our finding was present for the 
unadjusted model as well as both adjusted models (one model adjusted for age, gender, 
BMI; a second model adjusted for age, gender, BMI, certification length, drug use, drug test, 
muscular disease, seatbelt use, seizure history and speed). Univariate analyses, drivers with 
one medical condition were significantly less likely to be involved in either a crash of any 
severity or a preventable crash of any severity. However, this protective relationship for 
drivers with 1 condition was not present in either of the fully adjusted models, or in the

 partially adjusted model for preventable crashes of any severity, suggesting the lack of an 
independently protective effect.
DOT Reportable Crashes
Among drivers with DOT-reportable crashes, the drivers with 3 medical conditions or 4 or 
more medical conditions were significantly more likely to be involved in a DOT-reportable 
crash and a preventable DOT-reportable crash. The hazard ratio was highest among drivers 
with 3 conditions and dropped slightly for those with 4 conditions. Drivers with one 
condition had a significantly protective hazard ratio for being in any DOT-reportable crash 
as compared to drivers with no medical conditions. Post hoc analyses excluding 
hypertension as one of the 13 medical conditions found there was no significant relationship 
between one medical condition and crash outcomes.
DOT Reportable Crashes with Injuries
Among drivers who had DOT-reportable crashes resulting in injuries, those drivers with 3 or 
more concomitant medical conditions were significantly more likely to be involved in both a 
crash resulting in injuries and a preventable crash resulting in injuries. These relationships 
remained after adjusting for potential confounders. It was not possible to adjust for all 
confounders seen in model 2 for other crash outcomes due to the small number of DOT-
reportable crashes resulting in injuries.
There were many drivers who had two or more crashes, with most of them being any crash 
first followed by a DOT reportable crash or crash with injuries. Additional adjusted analyses 
were conducted which only included time-to-event to the first crash, then excluded from the 
study beyond that date. These analyses found meaningfully higher hazard ratios for both 
preventable DOT reportable crashes with injuries of any cause and preventable DOT crashes 
with injuries, with HR=5.12 (95% CI 1.14, 23.30) and HR=6.57 (95% CI 2.30, 18.81) 
respectively. Therefore, the true risk for having a preventable DOT reportable crash appears 
likely somewhere between the first-event hazard ratio estimate of 5.12 and the repeated-
event hazard ratio estimate of 2.53. Similarly, the true risk for having a preventable DOT 
reportable crash with injuries is likely between the first-event hazard ratio estimate of 6.57 
and the repeated-event hazard ratio estimate of 2.23. All of which were statistically 
significant.
Discussion
This large retrospective cohort study of commercial truck drivers found consistent 
relationships between multiple medical conditions and three different measures of crashes, 
including costly DOT-reportable crashes and crashes with injuries, with two- to three-fold 
increased risk estimates. Risks of being in a crash were elevated among truck drivers with 
either three, or four or more medical conditions. This is the first study to examine and 
quantify the assumption that multiple comorbid medical conditions are associated with an 
increased crash risk among truck drivers. These results support the MRB recommendations 
in that these drivers warrant increased scrutiny and have an increased risk of crash.

 Furthermore, these data suggest multiple comorbid medical conditions are preventable 
causes of injuries and fatalities resulting from crashes.
There was dose response relationship between multiple concomitant medical conditions and 
DOT-reportable crash risk, but this relationship did not continue into the highest medical 
condition category (4 or more conditions) although it remained statistically significant yet 
lower than crash risk for drivers with 3 conditions. This may be due in part to a probable 
strong survivor bias in these data. Industry wide, if drivers are involved in a more severe 
crash (e.g., a DOT-reportable crash, particularly a crash with injuries), they are commonly 
removed from the driving pool, either through citation and loss of licensure, termination 
from the company, or prohibitive cost of repairing or insuring their vehicle if they are an 
owner operator. Smaller numbers of drivers with that many conditions may also limit the 
statistical power for greater numbers of medical conditions. The relative rarity of both 
numbers of drivers with 3 or more conditions and more severe crashes results in wide 
confidence bounds around the hazard ratio estimates. However, these hazard ratios are 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful, demonstrating a potentially causal 
association between having multiple medical conditions and subsequently having a crash. 
There is a meaningful difference in the crash risk estimate between those drivers with 2 
conditions and those with 3 conditions. This may be due to residual confounding, 
interactions between multiple medical conditions, or differences in reporting. It is widely 
believed that there is under-reporting of medical conditions among drivers, therefore our 
estimates are likely an underestimation of the true risk for crashes. Recent articles reported 
that when the driver’s BMI is >35 kg/m2, >90% have objectively diagnosed obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA) and at BMI of 40 kg/m2 and above almost 100% have OSA.(33, 49) 
These data have lower self-reported sleep disorders for the number of drivers with BMI 
above 35 kg/m2. Further research into these complex relationships and potential 
underreporting is needed.
Additionally, it is likely that these estimates are an underestimate of the true risk due to 
changes in exposure after having a crash. Drivers who had crashes of any severity and were 
still employed by the company remained in the risk pool for having a more severe crash. 
These drivers are given additional driving and crash-avoidance training or paired up with 
another driver-trainer. Therefore, their risk for a subsequent crash changes meaningfully 
after the first crash of any severity if they remained employed by the company. The data in 
the primary analyses in the tables assumes that there is no change in exposure which is not 
true, but is the most conservative assumption.
This study’s strengths include the use of a large retrospective study with the ability to 
demonstrate temporality. Data were systematically captured across the population. The study 
was sufficiently powered to assess risk factor relationships with crash outcomes of three 
different severity measures. These findings may be generalizable to other trucking 
companies and other safety sensitive jobs. Another strength is the ability to assess the 
relationship between multiple comorbid conditions and differing severities of crash, 
including the DOT-reportable and preventable crashes, which are regarded as the most 
relevant in the trucking industry. Weaknesses include data that are limited to those collected 
as part of the CDME and the company. These data are comparable to other studies among

 commercial truck drivers as well as data from the American Trucking Association survey of 
members performed in 2010. There is no potential to gather additional data such as primary 
care provider records, and therefore we are unable to address additional factors that could 
cause or contribute to crashes that are not addressed in this study and may have importance 
in the commercial truck driving population. The hazard ratio estimates are calculated from 
relatively small numbers of drivers with 3 or more medical conditions and few crashes. 
These small sample sizes result in wider confidence bounds and limited ability to arrive at 
definitive conclusions. While the hazard ratio estimates may fall within a large range, these 
demonstrated temporal relationships between multiple conditions and multiple types of 
crash are statistically significant. Care should be taken when interpreting the true crash risk 
from multiple medical conditions due to the small sample size and rarity of some crash 
events. Additionally, although we did statistically adjust for BMI, many of the medical 
conditions have relationships with obesity. There are demonstrated relationships with 
increasing BMI and increasing counts of medical conditions.(41) Particularly, the 
relationship between increasing BMI and higher prevalence of OSA, which has repeatedly 
shown an association with crash risk, may be partially responsible for the increased risk of 
having a crash seen in these analyses.(49, 50) Similarly, age and male gender are associated 
with many of these health factors. We statistically adjusted for these confounding factors as 
well as BMI, however residual confounding may still exist. While we did perform analyses 
to control for driving tenure at the company, that was not a meaningful confounder in 
multivariate models and was not included in final models. However, age was included in 
final models and is generally collinear with driving experience. Unfortunately, the available 
data do not include total driving experience as a potential confounding factor, as only the 
tenure at the individual company was available. We evaluated company tenure and miles 
driven as potential confounders and found they had limited impact on the relationships 
between multiple medical conditions and crash risk and were not included in the final 
model.
Conclusion
Multiple comorbid medical conditions appear to be a risk factor for three different measures 
of crashes in this large population of CMV drivers. Risk estimates were more than two- to 
three-fold increased. This study supports the FMCSA Medical Review Board’s 
recommendations insofar as drivers with multiple conditions are at increased risk of being 
involved in a crash and therefore, merit additional scrutiny during medical certification 
examinations. These relationships remained after controlling for important confounders. 
Further research should focus on the identification of specific conditions from the multiple 
conditions matrix that increase crash risk, and that may be amenable to more aggressive 
treatment and more restrictive limits on driver certification that may reduce the risk of 
preventable crashes and related injuries and fatalities to truck drivers and the traveling 
public.
