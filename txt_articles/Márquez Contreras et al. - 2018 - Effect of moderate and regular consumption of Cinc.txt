Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the impact that the moderate and regular consumption of 
Cinco Jotas acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian ham has on overall cardiovascular risk, lipid pa-
rameters, blood pressure, and weight.
Methods: A longitudinal, analytical, and quasi- 
experimental clinical study with re-
peated measures was carried out with 100 randomly selected individuals in primary 
care. The sample population included men and women (64%) between the ages of 25 
and 55 (42.08, SD 9.6) who were not diagnosed with any cardiovascular illness or dia-
betes, were not undergoing antihypertensive treatment, nor taking lipid- 
lowering 
drugs. There were four visits during a 2- 
week washout period for the first of three 
phases. Phases 2 and 3 included an 8- 
week habitual diet phase followed by an 8- 
week intervention phase when participants consumed 40 g daily of acorn- 
fed 100% 
Cinco Jotas Iberian ham. Measurements of cardiovascular risk factors were taken 
following the SCORE table. These included total cholesterol, high- 
density lipopro-
teins cholesterol (HDL- 
c), low- 
density lipoproteins cholesterol (LDL- 
c), triglycerides 
(TG), and weight.
Results: The average vascular risk (SCORE) was 0.20 (SD 0.49) before the consump-
tion phase and 0.18 (SD 0.48) at the end of the study (p > 0.05). An increase in HDL- 
c 
of 5 mg/dl was observed while there was a decrease in LDL- 
c and TG of 10 mg/dl 
(p < 0.05). There were no differences in total cholesterol levels, blood pressure, or 
weight; nor were differences observed in average consumption of calories, protein, 
lipids, carbohydrates, or alcohol (p > 0.05).
Conclusions: The daily consumption of 40 g of Cinco Jotas acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian 
ham does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and has a favorable impact 
on lipid levels without affecting blood pressure or weight.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Scientific evidence has proven the beneficial effect that some foods 
have on cardiovascular diseases (CVD), some forms of cancer, and 
other degenerative diseases (Deleuze Isasi, 2006), but it must also 
confirm that these foods do not contribute to the appearance of 
cardiovascular risk factors like increased cholesterol total (TC), high- 
density lipoproteins cholesterol (HDL- 
c), low- 
density lipoproteins 
cholesterol (LDL- 
c), triglycerides (TG), and blood pressure.
Cinco Jotas acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian ham, produced principally 
in southwest Spain and considered a red meat, is a popular part of 
Spanish cuisine. This ham, made from the hind quarters of Iberian 
pigs nourished primarily on grass and acorns, is cured, seasoned with 
salt, and exposed to a range of favorable environmental conditions 
and habitats (Deleuze Isasi, 2006; Jiménez- 
Colmenero, Ventanas, & 
Toldrá, 2010). The Cinco Jotas curing cellars have the right conditions 
to ensure proper maturation of the hams by naturally maintaining 
just the right temperature and humidity levels, allowing the perfor-
mance of proteases found naturally in meat. This process instils in 
the ham certain nutritional characteristics such as high- 
biological- 
value proteins and elevated levels of iron, zinc, and B vitamins. 
Importantly, its 5% fat content is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, of 
which between 67% and 68% (Ortega, López- 
 Sobaler, Requejo, & 
Andrés, 2003) is composed of oleic acid. The ham is also rich in poly-
phenols and amino acids which are released by the proteolysis that 
occurs during the curing process (De la Hoz, Lopez, Hierro, Cambero, 
& Ordonez, 1996).
Several studies have confirmed the cardiovascular health ben-
efits of the Mediterranean diet and, specifically, the consumption 
of olive oil and other monounsaturated fats (Deleuze Isasi, 2006) 
associated with a lower incidence of CVD, cancer, high blood pres-
sure, obesity, and osteoporosis (Jiménez- 
Colmenero et al., 2010). 
Similarly, different components of this diet have been associated 
with providing varying degrees of protection against these same 
diseases (Martínez- 
González & Sanchez- 
Villegas, 2004; Ruiz- 
Canela 
López et al., 2009).
The results of these studies are inconclusive, highlighting the 
protective health benefits of foods such as olive oil, vegetables, 
fruits, and nuts (Bes- 
Rastrollo et al., 2007; Martínez- 
González 
et al., 2008), while others associate the consumption of red meats 
with obesity, increased blood pressure, or CVD (Bes- 
rastrollo et al., 
2006; Dominguez et al., 2018; Kontogianni, Panagiotakos, Pitsavos, 
Chrysohoou, & Stefanadis, 2008; Ruiz- 
Canela López et al., 2009; 
Wang, Manson, Buring, & Sesso, 2008; Xu, Yin, & Tong, 2007). In the 
case of the latter, occasional consumption is recommended due to 
the high content of saturated fatty acids, although it must be consid-
ered that different red meats have varying nutritional compositions 
and effects on one’s health (Ruiz- 
Canela López et al., 2009).
As a result, the moderate and regular consumption of Cinco Jotas 
acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian ham can be considered to have beneficial 
effects on cardiovascular health. Several studies have addressed 
this line of research. While it is true that these studies are not 
conclusive due to population biases and small sample populations, 
atherothrombotic profile improvements were observed (Maciá 
Botejara et al., 2005), as were improvements to lipid profile (Martín, 
Escudero- 
Gilete, Romero, & Vicario, 2009; Mayoral et al., 2003; 
Rebollo et al., 1998). Nondetrimental effects on CVD, blood pres-
sure, and weight gain were also observed (Ruiz- 
Canela López et al., 
2009).
The objectives of this study were primarily to evaluate the im-
pact that the moderate and regular consumption Cinco Jotas acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian ham has on overall cardiovascular health and, 
secondarily, on lipid parameters (TC, TG, HDL- 
c, and LDL- 
c), blood 
pressure, weight, and waist circumference (WC).
2 | MATERIAL AND METHODS
This clinical study was designed to be longitudinal, analytical, and 
quasi- 
experimental with pre- and postrepeated measures. With 
a level of significance of 5%, assuming that the proportion in the 
reference group is 80.00%, and the proportion in the experimental 
group is 90.00%, and that the superiority limit is 2.00%, we needed 
to include 97 subjects in the study. Estimating a 9% dropout rate, a 
recruit total of 106 participants was deemed appropriate. The soft-
ware Ene 3.0 was used to estimate the size of the sample popula-
tion. The participants were randomly selected from patients who 
had visited the Health Centre during the last three weeks of June 
2016 using numbers randomly generated from Microsoft Excel. Six 
subjects were selected from the daily roster of patients for each 
doctor. If they met the criteria for inclusion, they were invited to 
participate in the study. Approximately 60 subjects were recruited 
each week.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) individuals of both 
sexes between the ages of 25 and 55 years old; (b) absence of any 
documented CVD (including stroke, transient ischemic attack, 
acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable 
ischemic cardiopathy, or peripheral arterial disease); (c) individ-
uals who have provided written informed consent; (d) individu-
als whose caloric intake was between 80 and 105% of the daily 
amount recommended for their profile and met the nutritional 
objectives for the general adult population regarding macronu-
trients. The criteria for exclusion were as follows: (a) pregnant or 
breastfeeding women; (b) individuals whose pathological situa-
tion could interfere with the development of the study(e.g., acute 
stroke, acute myocardial infarction or cancer); (c) individuals who

were already participating in any other study; (d) individuals un-
dergoing pharmacological treatment for high cholesterol or high 
blood pressure; and (e) diabetics.
Subjects could be withdrawn from the study if they developed 
any illness that would complicate their participation in the study, or if 
the subject decided not to continue with the study or the prescribed 
visits.
The study took place between June and November 2016 with 
each subject monitored for 18 weeks. Nine primary care investiga-
tors (five doctors and four nurses) and two laboratory technicians 
participated in this study.
The study was composed of three phases:
1. Washout phase: A 2-week period during which subjects were 
to continue their usual dietary habits, taking care not to change 
their eating behaviors.
2. Habitual diet phase: An 8-week period during which subjects 
were to continue their usual dietary habits. This phase was con-
trolled by a diet survey.
3. Intervention phase: The individuals received 40-g portions of 
vacuum-packed Cinco Jotas acorn-fed 100% Iberian ham to eat 
daily at breakfast for 8 weeks. The check-in visits were attended 
by a nurse in the health center who was experienced with the 
food survey and in the extraction, preparation, and distribution of 
samples. The subjects were advised to continue their usual diet 
throughout the study. Compliance with the daily intake of the 
product was assessed by counting empty packages, with a 90% 
compliance considered to be compliant. The product provided 
contained Cinco Jotas acorn-fed 100% Iberian ham, sea salt, anti-
oxidant 
E-301 
(sodium 
ascorbate), 
acidity 
regulator 
E-331(trisodium citrate), and preservative E-252 (potassium 
nitrate).E-301, E-331, and E-252 have a technical function during 
the initial phase of production but by the end of the process they 
deteriorate and are no longer present in the final product. The 
quantities added are negligible, such minute quantities that they 
do not affect the final amount of ions in the end product.
The results of a nutritional study based on 54 samples are shown 
in Table 1.
The 40- 
g portions of ham were sent by courier weekly from the 
slicing and packing room of the producer in Jabugo to the health cen-
ter, where they were collected by the subjects. The portions did not 
require refrigeration because they were delivered within 5 days of 
consumption. The cured ham was provided sliced, in 40- 
g portions, 
in thermoforming vacuum packaging, without identifying the brand 
on the packaging.
There were four visits, the initial visit and three follow- 
up vis-
its at 2, 10, and 18 weeks. During the initial screening visit, crite-
ria were reviewed to confirm subject eligibility, participants were 
fully briefed, both orally and in print form, and they signed in-
formed consent forms. Each subject provided their clinical history 
and the SCORE table was used to evaluate levels of cardiovascu-
lar risk. Weight, height, WC, and blood pressure were measure at 
each visit. Blood pressure was taken using an Omron M6 blood 
pressure monitor. The recommendations of the American Heart 
Association were followed; thus, the anthropometric measure-
ments (weight and height) were taken with participants barefoot 
and wearing light clothes, using a stadiometer and a scale with a 
precision of 100 g, and the WC was recorded using a calibrated 
measuring tape.
The Spanish Food Composition Database (www.bedca.net/
bdpub) was used to determine the caloric and nutrient content of 
the food. To determine if the patient had followed a stable daily 
diet, the nutritional survey of the Community of Madrid (ENUCAM)

was administered both at the beginning and at the end of the study. 
This survey consists of two subsurveys; the first is a 24- 
hour di-
etary recall survey administered by a nurse. It records the times and 
content of meals or snacks ingested during the previous day (food 
and beverages), including quantities, ingredients, and preparation 
methods. The second part was a self- 
administered survey about the 
participant’s own consumption of food during the previous week. 
The recommendations and clinical procedures used by our reference 
laboratory at the Juan Ramón Jiménez Hospital in Huelva were used 
for the measurement of biochemical parameters.
The main variable assessed was cardiovascular risk, for which 
the SCORE table was used to combine factors such as age, gender, 
smoker/nonsmoker (33% of the sample were smokers), systolic blood 
pressure (SBP), and TC level. The secondary variables were TC level, 
HDLc, LDL- 
c, TG, glycemie, uric acid (UA), C- 
reactive protein (CRP), 
weight, and WC. The diet, caloric and nutritional intakes of each in-
dividual and physical activity were calculated using the ENUCAM 
surveys. The detection of biochemical markers was carried out in the 
Juan Ramón Jiménez Hospital laboratory in Huelva, and the prepa-
ration of the Cinco Jotas acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian ham sample in the 
Cinco Jotas laboratory of Jabugo in the Huelva province of Spain.
A univariate analysis of both socio- 
demographic and clinical vari-
ables was first performed to describe the variables in each partic-
ipant sample. Subsequently, a bivariate analysis was performed to 
measure the difference (if any) between the values in the pre- 
 and 
postanalysis groups. The main variable was evaluated by calculat-
ing the mean decreases in each phase and comparing the mean 
decreases of the SCORE measures. Both the repeated- 
measures 
ANOVA test and the Wilcoxon signed- 
rank test were used, includ-
ing their respective effect size estimates: partial eta- 
squared (η2) 
for the ANOVA and Cohen’s d for the Wilcoxon signed- 
rank test. 
In all cases, a statistical significance of 5% was required (p < 0.05), 
thus determining the confidence intervals. The statistical analyses 
were carried out by the Methodology Department of the Beturia 
Foundation for Health Research using the statistical program SPSS 
version 21.0.
3 | RESULTS
A total of 148 subjects were evaluated, of which 105 were recruited. 
Forty- 
three individuals were excluded from the study; 22 were over 
the age of 55 (17 women and five men), one was pregnant, three 
women and two men presented multiple pathologies, three women 
declined to participate, and 12 presented with high blood pressure, 
diabetes, or dyslipidemia under pharmacological treatment (seven 
women and five men).
Of the 105 subjects eventually selected, 100 completed the 
study: one subject moved away from the area, two did not want to 
repeat the periodic visits to the center for analysis, and two cited 
family problems that prevented them from continuing. The final 
sample was composed of 64 women (64%) and 36 men (36%) with a 
global average age of 42.08 (SD 9.6) years.
The compliance with the daily intake of ham was 92%. The re-
maining 8% reported that although they had discarded the packaging, 
they had in fact eaten the daily portion. The average cardiovascular 
risk was calculated as 0.20 (SD: 0.49) before the intervention phase 
and 0.18 (SD: 0.48) at the end of the study, with no significant differ-
ences observed (p > 0.05, dC = 0.04, rYλ = 0.02).
Table 2 (Supporting Information) shows the exploratory findings 
and the analytical results, which follow a normal distribution according 
to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, so an ANOVA test of repeated mea-
sures was performed. Significant differences were observed in the 
means, with an increase in HDL- 
c and a decrease in LDL- 
c, TG, and UA.

self- 
administered surveys. As these variables did not follow a normal 
distribution according to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, we applied 
the Wilcoxon signed- 
rank test and calculated the Cohen’s d to mea-
sure effect size.
No significant differences were observed during active interven-
tion, between the values obtained in the physical activity survey in 
the type of work developed, light, active, or very active. Seventy- 
four percent and 77% report performing some type of physical ac-
tivity, without significant differences. Highlights as 23% and 22% 
perform physical activity daily, and as 26 and 23% perform physi-
cal activity less than once a month. No significant differences were 
observed between the performance of another physical or sports 
activity during active intervention.
4 | DISCUSSION
Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that Cinco Jotas 
acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian ham can be consumed daily without any risk 
to cardiovascular health since it did not increase the risk in individu-
als consuming a daily portion of 40 g, a portion that can be consid-
ered regular and acceptable. No significant changes were observed 
in the creatinine (CR), blood pressure, TC levels, glycemie, CRP, 
weight, and WC; values that did not change throughout the study.
These results coincide with those obtained by Maciá Botejara 
et al. (2005), who observed an improvement in the atherothrombotic 
profile, and those of Mayoral et al. (2003), who observed a drop in 
blood pressure, increase in antioxidants, and decrease in lipid perox-
idation after a period of 6 weeks consuming cured ham made from 
acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian pigs.
Significant differences have been observed in the composition 
of some fatty acids in pigs due to differences in the feeding plan 
(Bes- 
Rastrollo et al., 2006; Bes- 
Rastrollo et al., 2007; De la Hoz 
et al., 1996; Dominguez et al., 2018; Estruch, Ros, Salas- 
Salvad, 
Covas, & Corella, 2013; Kontogianni et al., 2008; Maciá Botejara 
et al., 2005; Martínez- 
González & Sanchez- 
Villegas, 2004; 
Martínez- 
González et al., 2008; Ruiz- 
Canela López et al., 2009; 
Wang et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2007), with favorable outcomes for 
animals who graze free range during the montanera season, as is 
the case with Cinco Jotas acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian ham. Animals 
were fed diets of grass and acorns (montanera), acorns and cereals 
(recebo), or cereals (cebo). The total lipid fraction from intramus-
cular fat resulted in significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) between all 
three batches in the composition of C18:1 and C 18:2, and be-
tween montanera and the other two batches in the fatty acids 
C14:0 and C16:0. For intermuscular fat, significant differences 
(p ≤ 0.05) were observed between all three batches for the fatty 
acids C14:0, C16:0, C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3). Although Cinco Jotas 
acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian ham can be considered a red meat, our re-
sults indicate that its habitual consumption cannot be associated 
with obesity, nor with the increase in blood pressure or CVD, as 
happens with the habitual consumption of other red meats (Bes- 
rastrollo et al., 2006; Kontogianni et al., 2008; Ruiz- 
Canela López 
et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2007). This may be due 
to the nutritional characteristics linked to the curing process (De 
la Hoz et al., 1996; Ortega et al., 2003), as previously indicated. 
On the contrary, the study results show that consuming Cinco 
Jotas acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian ham as part of a Mediterranean diet 
can be considered to be heart healthy, producing an increase in 
HDL- 
c and a decrease in LDL- 
c, TG, and UA. These results agree 
with those of Martín, Escudero- 
Gilete, Romero, and Vicario 
(Martín et al., 2009). In fact, as already mentioned, several stud-
ies point out the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet and 
the consumption of monounsaturated fats (Martínez- 
González 
& Sanchez- 
Villegas, 2004; Ruiz- 
Canela López et al., 2009). The 
Cinco Jotas ham used in the study contains a high concentration 
of monounsaturated fatty acids as well as other foods included in 
the Mediterranean diet.
Saban- 
Ruiz et al. (2017) conducted a study evaluating the arte-
rial endothelium in 50 healthy subjects between 25 and 55 years of 
age, who consumed 50 g of ham daily for 6 weeks. In this study, they 
compared the effects of the consumption of Serrano ham and acorn- 
fed Iberian ham, observing that the regular consumption of both was 
associated with cardiovascular benefits. Although both types of ham 
produced an improvement in endothelial function, this improvement 
was superior in the case of the acorn- 
fed Iberian ham. This could be 
explained by its higher content of polyphenols, potent antioxidants, 
and anti- 
inflammatory effects at the vascular level. Additionally,

neither of them produced weight gain, nor did they modify the lipid 
profile. Moderate decreases in blood pressure were also observed. 
These results support those found in this current study.
Multiple studies have identified natural peptides with antihy-
pertensive effects generated during the curing process of Spanish 
dry- 
cured ham (Escudero, Aristoy, Nishimura, Arihara, & Toldrá, 
2012; Escudero et al., 2013; Martínez- 
Sánchez et al., 2017; Mora, 
Escudero, Arihara, & Toldrá, 2015). These peptides are powerful 
antioxidants and inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme 
(ACE), useful in counteracting the hypertensive effect of the high 
salt content (Ruiz- 
Canela López et al., 2009).
Beyond phenolic compounds, other phenomena could help main-
tain blood pressure, such as the high content of oleic acid and pro-
teins or the increased bioavailability of nitric oxide for endothelial 
improvement and its vasodilator effect, together with the decrease 
in the vasoconstriction factors of the vascular bed (Martínez- 
Sánchez et al., 2017).
Several limitations of the present study should be considered. 
The sample consisted of young and healthy subjects, without includ-
ing risk or clinical groups. The sample obtained from 100 individ-
uals has been sufficient to achieve the objectives of the study. It 
has been obtained randomly among patients under 55 years of age 
who attend a health center, present no cardiovascular risk factors, 
and complied with the prescribed intake to a high degree. Therefore, 
the results can be applicable to a similar population. A future study 
could involve a comparison with these alternative groups, in order 
to analyze the effect of Cinco Jotas acorn- 
fed 100% Iberian ham 
consumption on an at- 
risk or sick population. The use of surveys to 
track food consumption and physical exercise, although validated by 
other studies, may also be subject to social bias, since the data ob-
tained are based on the recall or journal- 
keeping habits of the sub-
jects themselves. This stumbling block is difficult to overcome, and 
although a study could be done under controlled feeding conditions, 
it would then lose ecological validity.
In conclusion, consuming 40 g of Cinco Jotas acorn- 
fed 100% 
Iberian ham daily is recommended for the general population. It does 
not increase cardiovascular risk, has favorable effects on different 
lipid parameters, and does not affect blood pressure or weight. It 
could be recommended for dyslipidemic patients with low HDL, 
where effective therapeutic treatments are scarce. However, more 
evidence is necessary.
