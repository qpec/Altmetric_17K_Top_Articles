Signalling through the PERK/eIF2a-P branch of the unfolded protein response plays a critical role in controlling protein synthesis
rates in cells. This pathway is overactivated in brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders and has recently
emerged as a promising therapeutic target for these currently untreatable conditions. Thus, in mouse models of neurodegenerative
disease, prolonged overactivation of PERK/eIF2a-P signalling causes sustained attenuation of protein synthesis, leading to memory
impairment and neuronal loss. Re-establishing translation rates by inhibition of eIF2a-P activity, genetically or pharmacologically,
restores memory and prevents neurodegeneration and extends survival. However, the experimental compounds used preclinically
are unsuitable for use in humans, due to associated toxicity or poor pharmacokinetic properties. To discover compounds that have
anti-eIF2a-P activity suitable for clinical use, we performed phenotypic screens on a NINDS small molecule library of 1040 drugs.
We identified two compounds, trazodone hydrochloride and dibenzoylmethane, which reversed eIF2a-P-mediated translational
attenuation in vitro and in vivo. Both drugs were markedly neuroprotective in two mouse models of neurodegeneration, using
clinically relevant doses over a prolonged period of time, without systemic toxicity. Thus, in prion-diseased mice, both trazodone
and dibenzoylmethane treatment restored memory deficits, abrogated development of neurological signs, prevented neurodegenera-
tion and significantly prolonged survival. In tauopathy-frontotemporal dementia mice, both drugs were neuroprotective, rescued
memory deficits and reduced hippocampal atrophy. Further, trazodone reduced p-tau burden. These compounds therefore repre-
sent potential new disease-modifying treatments for dementia. Trazodone in particular, a licensed drug, should now be tested in
clinical trials in patients.

 Introduction
Overactivation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) has
emerged as a major pathogenic mechanism across the spec-
trum of neurodegenerative diseases, for which no disease-
modifying treatments currently exist (Hetz et al., 2013;
Smith and Mallucci, 2016). Dysregulation of the pancreatic
endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) branch of the UPR is
particularly prominent: high levels of activated PERK
(PERK-P) and its downstream target, the phosphorylated
alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2�) are
seen in brains of patients with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) (Hoozemans et al., 2007, 2009; Stutzbach
et al., 2013), and also in the rare prion disorders. In these
disorders, PERK-P and eIF2�-P accumulation are tempor-
ally and spatially associated with the deposition of disease-
specific misfolded proteins—notably phosphorylated tau in
Alzheimer’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy
(Nijholt et al., 2012; Stutzbach et al., 2013).
eIF2�-P controls global protein synthesis rates by inhibit-
ing translation at the level of initiation (Sonenberg and
Hinnebusch, 2009). Phosphorylation of eIF2� is controlled
by activation of PERK, and also by the eIF2� kinases of the
closely related integrated stress response (ISR) (Ron and
Walter, 2007). In the brain, eIF2� represents a hub for
controlling rates of protein synthesis essential for learning
and memory formation and for maintaining neuronal integ-
rity in health and disease. Sustained overactivation of
PERK/eIF2�-P signalling causes chronic translational at-
tenuation leading to synapse loss and neurodegeneration
in prion-diseased and FTD mice (Moreno et al., 2012;
Radford et al., 2015). This is prevented by genetic and
pharmacological
interventions
that
reduce
or
inhibit
eIF2�-P signalling, restoring translation rates (Moreno
et al., 2012, 2013; Halliday et al., 2015; Radford et al.,
2015). Similar interventions restore memory in various
mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (Ma et al., 2013;
Devi and Ohno, 2014) and boost memory in wild-type
mice (Sidrauski et al., 2013). This occurs downstream
and irrespective of the disease-specific misfolded protein/s
involved, with broad relevance for potential treatment of a
range of neurodegenerative diseases. However, preclinical
pharmacological approaches have not yet yielded com-
pounds suitable for translation to the clinic. Despite being
markedly neuroprotective, the selective PERK inhibitor,
GSK2606414, is toxic to the pancreas due to the extent
of UPR inhibition and on-target effects of PERK inhibition
(Moreno et al., 2013; Halliday et al., 2015). In contrast,
the small molecule ISRIB (Sidrauski et al., 2013), which
acts
downstream
of
eIF2�-P
(Sekine
et
al.,
2015;
Sidrauski et al., 2015), is neuroprotective without pancre-
atic toxicity, due to an inherent limitation in its potency for
UPR/ISR inhibition (Halliday et al., 2015). ISRIB, however,
is highly insoluble and unsuitable for use in humans in its
current form. Thus, despite the promise of the mechanistic
target, safe and effective drugs acting on the pathway do
not exist.
The development of such therapeutics is the focus of
many drug discovery initiatives. However, this is in an in-
herently time-consuming and costly endeavour. In contrast,
drug repurposing can bypass much of this process, if exist-
ing compounds with the desired activity can be found
amongst the current pharmacopeia. Thus, in an effort to
identify safe drugs with anti-eIF2�-P therapeutic activity,
but lacking associated toxicity and/or adverse pharmacoki-
netic properties, we carried out phenotypic screens using
the NINDS (National Institute for Neurological Disorders
and Stroke) Custom Collection 2 Library of 1040 com-
pounds containing �75% FDA-approved drugs (often al-
ready licensed for use in patients). Our aim was to identify
compounds that can reverse UPR/ISR activation induced by
UPR stressors such as tunicamycin or thapsigargin in cells/
model systems. This would allow detection of compounds
with pharmacological activity on the UPR/ISR, which could
be tested for therapeutic efficacy in vivo.
Our screens yielded two compounds with anti-eIF2�-P
activity that we took forward to test in mouse models of
neurodegeneration. Biochemically, trazodone hydrochlor-
ide,
a
licensed
anti-depressant,
and
dibenzoylmethane
(DBM) restored protein synthesis rates in prion-diseased
and
tauopathy
FTD
mice
with
established
disease.
Clinically, both drugs prevented the emergence of clinical
signs in most treated prion-diseased mice and restored
memory in FTD mice; pathologically, both drugs markedly
reduced neuronal loss and hippocampal atrophy in both
models. There was no toxicity, in particular to the pan-
creas.
Given
the
prevalence
of
UPR
activation
in
Alzheimer’s disease, other tauopathies and related dis-
orders, we propose that these compounds could be rapidly
repositioned for clinical trials to determine the efficacy of
this therapeutic approach for the treatment of dementia.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
CHO-KI CHOP::luciferase cells (gift of David Ron) and

(Invitrogen), and mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells were cul-
tured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% foetal calf
serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1� penicillin/streptomycin. All
cells were maintained at 37�C with 5% CO2. Cell lines were
chosen due to known robust UPR responses, and regularly
checked for mycoplasma contamination.

 per well in a 24-well plate and left to grow overnight. Cells
were treated for 6 h with 5 mg/ml tunicamycin or vehicle only
[100% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO)] and then extracted using
the Steady-Glo� luciferase assay system (Promega) before
being quantified using the GloMax� 96 microplate lumin-
ometer (Promega). The hits from the Caenorhabditis elegans
screen (Supplementary Table 1) were incubated with 5 mg/ml
tunicamycin for 6 h at 20 mM before assaying as above. Drugs
that reduced CHOP::luciferase expression by �50% (in a simi-
lar manner to ISRIB) (Halliday et al., 2015) are predicted to be
efficacious without toxicity.
Immunoblotting
Protein samples were isolated from hippocampi or cells using
RIPA lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton
TM X-100, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 50 mM Tris pH8.0) sup-
plemented with PhosSTOP
TM and protease inhibitors (Roche).
Protein levels were determined by resolving 20 mg of protein on
SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose or PVDF mem-
branes and incubated with primary antibodies for eIF2�-P
(1:1000; Cell Signaling 3597s), eIF2� (1:1000; Cell Signaling
2103s), ATF4 (CREB-2, 1:1000; Santa Cruz sc200), ATF6
(1:1000; Genetek 70B1413), GSK3b (1:2000, Cell Signaling,
9832), pSer9-GSK3b (1:1000, Cell Signaling, 9322), total tau
(tau-5, 1:2000; Invitrogen ANB0042), p-tau (AT100, 1:2000;
Thermo Fisher Scientific MN1060). Horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000; Dako) were applied
and protein visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE
Healthcare) and quantitated using ImageJ. Antibodies against
GAPDH (1:5000; Santa Cruz sc32233), b-actin (1:5000;
Abcam ab8227) and b-tubulin (1:5000; Millipore MAB1637)
were used to determine loading. To detect PrPSc (prion protein)
homogenized samples were digested with 50 mg/ml of protein-
ase
K
(PK)
at
37�C
for
1 h
prior
to
electrophoresis.
Membranes were then probed with ICSM-35 (1:10 000; D-
GEN 0130-03501) and goat anti-mouse (1:10 000; Dako).
XBP1 splicing assay
Total RNA was extracted from CHO-KI cells with the
mirVana
TM RNA/miRNA isolation kit (Ambion Inc.). RNA
samples were reverse-transcribed with ImProm-II
TM reverse
transcriptase (Promega) by priming with oligo(dT). XBP1 (x-
box binding protein 1) mRNA was amplified with primers
flanking
the
26
base
pair
intron
(5’-GGAGTGGAGTAA
GGCTGGTG and 5’-CCAGAATGCCCAAAAGGATA) with
Phusion�
High-Fidelity
Taq
Polymerase
(New
England
Biolabs). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were resolved
on 3% agarose gels. Mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2A) were
treated with tunicamycin (5mg/ml) for 8h and used as a positive
control for XBP1 splicing (Quaglio et al., 2011).
Quantification of XBP1 splicing by
quantitative PCR
HEK293 cells were treated with tunicamycin (5 mg/ml) and
either trazodone, DBM (both 20 mM) or DMSO for 6 h.
Total RNA was extracted with the mirVana
TM RNA/miRNA
isolation kit (Ambion Inc.). RNA samples were reverse-tran-
scribed with ImProm-II
TM reverse transcriptase (Promega) by
priming with oligo(dT). Quantitative PCR was carried out at
95�C for an initial 3 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation
at 95�C for 10 s, annealing at 65�C for 15 s and extension at
72�C
for
30 s

XBP1 was detected using primers: forward 5’TGCTGAGTC
CGCAGCAGGTG3’ and reverse 5’GCTGGCAGGCTCTGGG
GAAG3’ and compared to the b-actin reference gene (forward
5’CCGATCCACACGGAGTACTTG3’ and reverse 5’GGCAC
CCAGCACAATGAAG3’).
Puromycin labelling and
immunoblot analysis
The effects of endoplasmic reticulum stress on puromyciny-
lated protein levels were determined as previously described
(Halliday et al., 2015). In brief, 106 HEK293 cells were
plated in 6-well plates. Two days later, culture media was
changed to fresh media, and cells were treated with vehicle
(DMSO) or thapsigargin in the presence or absence of the
indicated concentration of inhibitors for 2.5 h. For puromycin
labelling, 10 mg/ml puromycin was added during the last
10 min before harvest. Cells were lysed with passive lysis
buffer (Sigma) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). After centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 20 min, super-
natants were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. To detect
puromycinylated protein 20 mg of total protein, respectively,
was
subjected
to
12%
SDS-PAGE
and
transferred
onto
PVDF
membrane.
Immunoblot
detection
was
conducted
using
primary
antibodies
for
puromycinylated
protein
(1:5000; Proteintech). Scanned images were quantified using
ImageJ software.
Measurement of ternary complex
activity
To obtain pRLSV40 ATF4 5’UTR constructs, the human
ATF4 5’UTR (the upstream untranslated region) was amplified
using the following primer pair: Forward 5’CTGgctagcGC

 The PCR product was inserted into the NheI site of the
pRLSV40 construct (Meijer et al., 2013) upstream of the
Renilla luciferase coding region, creating pATF4 with the
intact ATF4 5’UTR, and pATF4mu with the upstream open
reading frames removed from the ATF4 5’UTR. The internal
control firefly luciferase-encoding plasmid pGL3 was pur-
chased
from
Promega
and
used
to
normalize
luciferase
expression.
CHO cells were grown in 12-well plates and transfected with
200 ng reporter plasmid and 30 ng control plasmid per well
using Lipofectamine� 3000 and the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Twenty-four hours later the cells were stressed with
1 mM
thapsigargin
and
treated
with
either
GSK2606414
(5 mM), ISRIB (1 mM), trazodone (20 mM) or DBM (20 mM).
Cells were lysed after the indicated incubation time using
Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and 10 ml of lysate were
assayed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega)
on
a
GloMax�
96
Microplate
Luminometer
(Promega). For DNA transfections, relative luciferase activity
was calculated as a ratio of Renilla luciferase (Rluc) to firefly
luciferase (Fluc).
Protein synthesis rates in ex vivo
slices
Protein synthesis rates were calculated by measuring 35S-me-
thionine incorporation into proteins in acute hippocampal
slices, as described (Moreno et al., 2012, 2013). In brief, hip-
pocampal
slices
were
prepared
with
a
tissue
chopper
(McIlwain) and dissected in an oxygenated cold (2–5�C) su-
crose artificial CSF containing 26 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl,
4 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2 and 250 mM sucrose. Slices were
allowed to recover in normal artificial CSF buffer while being
oxygenated at 37�C for 1 h in 95% O2/5% CO2, and then
incubated with 5.7 mBq of
35S-methionine label for 1 h.
Samples were washed and then homogenized in 1� passive
lysis buffer (Promega), and proteins were precipitated with
25% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (Sigma). TCA lysates were
then placed on Whatman filters, washed with 70% industrial
methylated spirits and acetone, and then placed into scintilla-
tion cocktail buffer. Incorporation of radiolabel was measured
by scintillation counting (WinSpectral, Wallac).
Histology
Paraffin-embedded brain and pancreas were sectioned at 5 mm
and stained with haematoxylin and eosin or NeuN antibody
(1:200; Millipore) for neuronal counts as described (Moreno
et al., 2012, 2013). All images were taken on using AxioVision
4.8 software (Zeiss) and counted using Volocity imaging
system. CA1 pyramidal neuron counts were determined using
three serial sections from five separate mice (Moreno et al.,
2012, 2013). All neuronal counting was performed with the
investigator being blind to the sample group being analysed.
Immunohistochemistry for pSer202/Thr205 tau was performed
using AT8 (1:100; Thermo Scientific).
Mice
Wild-type FVB mice were obtained from Charles River, UK.
rTg4510 tauP301L
+ and tauP301L
� mice were generated from
crossing FVB-Tg(tetO-MAPT*P301L)#Kha/JlwsJ (015815; The
Jackson
Laboratory)
with
B6.Cg-Tg(Camk2a-tTA)1Mmay/
DboJ (007004; The Jackson Laboratory).
Prion infection of mice
Tg37 + /� mice were inoculated with 1% brain homogenate of
Chandler/RML prions aged 3–4 weeks, as described (Mallucci
et al., 2003). Animals were culled when they developed clinical
signs of prion disease or lost 20% of body weight from the
start of the study. Control mice received 1% normal brain
homogenate.
Pharmacological treatment of mice
Mice were intraperitoneally injected once daily with 40 mg/kg
trazodone hydrochloride or vehicle (sterile saline), or fed pow-
dered diet 5LF2 containing 0.5% dibenzoylmethane ad lib-
itum.
Treatment
was
from
7
weeks
post-infection
until
terminal clinical sign appeared in tg37 + /� mice, or from
4 months until 8 months in rTg4510 mice. Sample sizes are
based on our previous papers (Moreno et al., 2012, 2013;
Mallucci et al., 2002, 2003), 12–15 mice are used per group
as this gives adequate statistical power to detect changes in
longevity and behaviour. Mice were randomly assigned a treat-
ment by cage number, and no mice were excluded from the
analysis. Experimenters were blind to the treatment group of
the mice when clinical signs were being assessed.
Detection of compounds by
LC-MS/MS
Wild-type FVB mice for these experiments were obtained from
Charles River. Blood and brain tissue were collected 2 or 8 h
after dosing from mice treated with one intraperitoneal dose of
40 mg/kg trazodone hydrochloride or vehicle. Blood and brain
tissue was also collected from mice given free access to food
mixture containing 0.5% dibenzoylmethane for 24 h before
testing. Blood plasma (up to 0.2 ml, exact volume measured)
was diluted with water to 0.2 ml and extracted with 0.4 ml of
chloroform:methanol 2:1(v/v). After vortex mixing (10 min)
and centrifugation (10 000g, 10 min), the lower layer was
dried with vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 50 ml
of methanol. Brain tissue (one complete half, �0.25 g weighed
exactly) was homogenized in 0.5 ml of chloroform: methanol
2:1 (v/v) and further processed exactly as the plasma samples.
Quantitative analysis (using external standards) was performed
by tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS)
using
a
4000
QTRAP
mass
spectrometer
(Applied
Biosystems) equipped with a turbo ion source and LC series
10 AD VP (Shimadzu). The mobile phase was a water/aceto-
nitrile gradient modified with 0.1% formic acid using an
Agilent 2 Poroshell 120 SB-C18 2.1 � 50 mm (2.7 mm particle
size) column, which was maintained at 40�C. LC-MS/MS mul-
tiple reaction monitoring used precursors and product ions of
mass/charge ratio (m/z) 372 and 148 for trazodone and m/z
225 and 105 for dibenzoylmethane in positive electrospray
ionization mode. Data analysis was carried out with Analyst
1.4.1 in the quantitative mode.

 Novel object recognition memory
test
Novel object recognition memory test was carried out as
described (Moreno et al., 2013). Briefly, mice were tested in
a black cylindrical arena (69-cm diameter) mounted with a
100 light-emitting diode cluster infrared light source and a
high-resolution day/night video camera (Sony). Mice were
acclimatized to the arena 5 days before testing. During the
learning phase, two identical objects were placed 15 cm from
the sides of the arena. Each mouse was placed in the arena for
two blocks of 10 min for exploration of the objects with an
intertrial interval of 10 min. Two hours later, one of the ob-
jects was exchanged for a new one, and the mouse was
replaced in the arena for 5 min (test phase). The amount of
time spent exploring all objects was tracked and measured for
each animal with EthoVision software (Tracksys Ltd). All ob-
jects and the arena were cleansed thoroughly between trials to
ensure the absence of olfactory cues.
Burrowing
Briefly, mice were placed in a large cage with a Perspex tube
full of food pellets, as described (Moreno et al., 2013). The
natural tendency of rodents is to displace (burrow) the food
pellets. The percentage of burrowing activity is calculated from
the difference in the weight of pellets in the tube before and
after 2 h.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism V6 software.
Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post
hoc test for multiple variables. For Kaplan-Meier analysis,
Mantel-Cox test was used. All data in bar charts shows
mean � standard error of the mean (SEM).
Experimental design
All animal work conformed to the ARRIVE guidelines, UK
Home Office regulations and institutional guidelines. Mice
were randomly assigned treatment groups by cage number.
Experimenter was blind to group allocation during the experi-
ments and when assessing clinical signs. For behavioural test-
ing no formal randomization was needed or used.
Results
Screening approach of small
compound library identifies potential
PERK branch UPR inhibitors
First, in a novel primary screen, we tested the ability of all
1040 compounds of the NINDS Custom Collection 2 in a
phenotypic screen in C. elegans. C. elegans have many ex-
perimental advantages as a model organism, many of which
pertain to drug screening. In contrast to cell lines, they con-
tain many cell types (in particular, a functioning nervous
system) and have easily observable phenotypes, increasing
the likelihood of detection of representative and translatable
effects of drugs on signalling pathways. For this screen, we
tested the ability of the NINDS compounds to prevent tuni-
camycin-induced
developmental
delay
in
C.
elegans
(Richardson et al., 2011) (Supplementary material and
Supplementary Fig. 1). Briefly, C. elegans develop through
four larval stages (L1–L4) before reaching adulthood, with
a generational time of 3 days. When C. elegans are exposed to
tunicamycin—a nucleoside antibiotic that inhibits N-linked gly-
cosylation and induces UPR activation—from hatching, the
development of the majority of worms stalls between the L2
and L3 larval stages. We considered any compound in the
screen that overcame the developmental delay as a potential
UPR inhibitor suitable for further investigation. Twenty com-
pounds (Supplementary Table 1, cropped) of the 1040 screened
(Supplementary Table 1, full) overcame the tunicamycin-
induced developmental delay in the nematodes.
To further delineate the mechanisms of action of the 20
‘hit’ compounds, we next used a system in which signal
transduction could be further investigated. Tunicamycin is
a generic UPR stressor, activating all three UPR branches
(Oslowski and Urano, 2011). We used a mammalian cell
model as a secondary screening system to identify com-
pounds acting through PERK branch mediated eIF2�-P sig-
nalling.
eIF2�
phosphorylation
leads
to
general
translational repression, while simultaneously stimulating
the selective translation of a number of specific mRNAs,
including activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). ATF4,
in turn induces expression of CHOP. CHOP expression is
thus a downstream effect of eIF2� phosphorylation. To
detect activation of the PERK/eIF2� pathway, we used a
CHO cell line containing a reporter construct encoding the
DDIT3 (CHOP) promoter and 5’ UTR region driving a
firefly luciferase transgene (Fig. 1A). Exposure to UPR
stressors induces robust luciferase expression in CHO
CHOP::luciferase cells (Harding et al., 2005). Thus, we
screened the 20 hit compounds from our primary screen
for degree of inhibition of luciferase response to tunicamy-
cin in CHOP::luciferase cells as a measure of inhibition of
eIF2�-P signalling. We were interested in compounds with

(Halliday et al., 2015). Five drugs met the criteria for a
‘hit’ in this screen. This was defined as a partial reduction
in luciferase signal induction in tunicamycin-stressed cells,
similar to �50% inhibition induced by ISRIB. In contrast,
GSK2606414 produced almost 100% inhibition of lucifer-
ase signal induction by tunicamycin, consistent with previ-
ous findings (Fig. 1A; Halliday et al., 2015).
We selected two of these five, trazodone hydrochloride and
DBM, for further testing because of their suitability for treat-
ing patients in eventual translational studies. Thus, trazo-

Further,
in
humans, trazodone is rapidly and almost completely ab-
sorbed orally, freely crosses the blood–brain barrier and
has a biological half-life of �10h. DBM is a naturally occur-
ring structural analogue of curcumin, with widely reported
anti-cancer properties (Khor et al., 2009), which has no
known toxicity. Two of the other three hits in this screen
were rejected because of lack of suitability for eventual trans-
lational studies in humans: trifluorperazine is an anti-psych-
otic contraindicated in the elderly (due to increased risk of
death when used to treat behavioural/psychological problems
caused by dementia in older people); azadirectin is a pesticide
found in neem oil and is poorly brain penetrant. The third
hit, proguanil, is an anti-malarial that is safe in humans;
however, it is toxic to mice, precluding our carrying out
the relevant preclinical experiments. We then tested the ef-
fects of increasing concentrations of trazodone and DBM in
CHOP::luciferase cells. Both drugs showed a dose-response
effect in inhibiting luciferase expression in the reporter cell
line reaching a plateau at 50 mM concentration, consistent
with an intrinsic limitation of inhibitory activity (Fig. 1B),
as reported for ISRIB (Halliday et al., 2015).

 DBM (20 mM) reduced ATF4 levels, but not eIF2�-P levels
in tunicamycin stressed cells (Fig. 2B), placing their site of
action downstream of eIF2�-P, like ISRIB. Consistent with
inhibition of eIF2�-P activity, DBM and trazodone partially
restored protein synthesis rates in tunicamycin-treated cells
(Fig. 2C). Due to the apparent similarities between trazo-
done and DBM and the mechanism of action of ISRIB
(which stabilizes eIF2B, facilitating ternary complex forma-
tion) (Sekine et al., 2015; Sidrauski et al., 2015), we next
determined if the compounds exerted a similar effect on
eIF2B and ternary complex levels as ISRIB. Under normal
circumstances, eIF2�-P reduces ternary complex availability
for initiation of translation, reducing protein synthesis
rates. However, selected mRNAs, including ATF4, are
able to overcome this block on translation due to the struc-
ture of their upstream translated region (5’UTR) that con-
tains multiple upstream open reading frames (Vattem and
Wek, 2004) and are translated more efficiently when eIF2�-
P levels are high. We used a luciferase reporter construct
downstream of the ATF4 5’UTR to transfect cells. The
ATF4 5’UTR directly responds to reduced levels of ternary
complex, resulting in activation of luciferase when eIF2�-P
levels are high, as on UPR induction. Following activation
of the UPR by thapsigargin treatment in transfected CHO
cells, both trazodone and dibenzoylmethane, like ISRIB,
prevented the wild-type ATF4 5’UTR activation normally
associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress (Fig. 2D). This
effect is lost when the ATF4 5’UTR with the upstream open
reading frames removed by a single nucleotide substitution
of the upstream ATG start codons is expressed and treated
in the same manner. Thus, these compounds prevent eIF2�-
P from reducing ternary complex levels, allowing transla-
tion to proceed when eIF2�-P levels are high.
We next investigated if trazodone and DBM affect eIF2B
dimerization in the same way as ISRIB (Sidrauski et al.,
2015). We observed that ISRIB caused a shift in both
eIF2B� and eIF2B" subunit distribution in sucrose gradients
consistent with increased dimerization of eIF2B, in agree-
ment with previously published work (Sidrauski et al.,
2015). However, neither trazodone nor DBM caused di-
merization of eIF2B (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, the
data show that while these drugs act at a similar level to
ISRIB to uncouple eIF2�-P-mediated reduction of ternary
complex, they are functioning via distinct mechanisms.
The compounds did not, however, act on the other UPR
branches, having no effect on tunicamycin-induced XBP1
splicing, as detected by PCR (Fig. 2E), or measured semi-
quantitatively by quantitative PCR (Fig. 2F), or cleavage of
ATF6 (Fig. 2G). Thus, these data, together with the evi-
dence from our primary and secondary screens, support
activity for both trazodone and DBM in restoring transla-
tion rates in vitro under conditions of UPR stress. Further,
the evidence shows that both compounds show partial in-
hibition of UPR-mediated translational repression (Fig. 1A)
and have an intrinsic limitation in this activity (Fig. 1B), as
previously seen with ISRIB (Halliday et al., 2015). This is
important, because this is known to be a safe level of UPR/
ISR reversal in vivo, in contrast to the toxicity produced by
complete inhibition of this signalling, as occurs with the
PERK inhibitor, GSK2606414 (Moreno et al., 2013).
Also, like ISRIB, it appears that the site of action of both
trazodone and DBM in inhibiting this activity is down-
stream
of
eIF2�-P,
at
the
level
of
ternary
complex
(Fig. 2D). Given these favourable in vitro features, both
compounds were put forward for testing in preclinical
mouse
models
of
neurodegenerative
disease
in
which
ISRIB and/or GSK2606414 have been shown to be neuro-
protective (despite pancreatic toxicity of the latter com-
pound) (Moreno et al., 2013; Halliday et al., 2015;
Radford et al., 2015).
Trazodone and dibenzoylmethane
penetrate the blood–brain barrier
We next tested the therapeutic effects of trazodone and
DBM in vivo. For clinical relevance, we used a daily dose
of 40 mg/kg of trazodone delivered intraperitoneally in
mice, equivalent to 194 mg/day in humans. Patients usually
receive 150–375 mg trazodone per day. We used a standard
conversion formula for dose translation to calculate the
corresponding mouse dose (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2008).
DBM oral suspension was provided in food as a 0.5%
mixture available ad libitum, as described (Khor et al.,
2009). Pharmacokinetic data pertaining to plasma levels
and brain penetration were investigated by quantitative
LC-MS/MS measurements in brain and plasma samples in
wild-type mice. Trazodone levels were measured at 2 and
8 h post-administration; DBM levels were measured after
24 h, to allow for sufficient consumption of food containing
the compound. The data confirmed both drugs penetrated
the blood–brain barrier with mean brain:plasma ratios con-
sistent with efficacious dosing (Supplementary Table 2).
Trazodone and dibenzoylmethane
prevent neurological signs of prion
disease in prion-infected mice
We first tested the drugs in mice with prion disease, for
comparison of their therapeutic efficacy with that of the
experimental
compounds
GSK2606414
and
ISRIB
(Moreno et al., 2013; Halliday et al., 2015; Radford
et al., 2015). We used hemizygous tg37 + /� mice (see
below), as in our previous investigations (Mallucci et al.,
2002, 2003; Moreno et al., 2012, 2013; Halliday et al.,
2015; Radford et al., 2015) so that we could directly com-
pare the efficacy of trazodone and DBM with previous gen-
etic
and

approaches.

 at 6 weeks post-infection (Peretti et al., 2015) and overt
synapse loss occurs from 7 weeks post-infection in RML-
infected tg37 + /� mice (Moreno et al., 2012). Dysregulated
PERK signalling leads to eIF2�-P-mediated translational re-
pression from �9 weeks post-infection, when cognitive def-
icits
and
memory
loss
are
detected.
Irreversible
neurodegeneration occurs at 10 weeks post-infection, with
signs of clinical neurological disease evident by 12 weeks
post-infection (Moreno et al., 2012) (Fig. 3A). Restoring
translation rates either upstream of eIF2�-P by inhibiting
PERK with GSK2606414 (Moreno et al., 2013), or down-
stream using ISRIB (Halliday et al., 2015), has previously
been shown to prevent clinical disease and neurodegenera-
tion in prion-infected mice, independent of PrP levels. As in
our previous studies (Moreno et al., 2013; Halliday et al.,
2015), RML-infected tg37 + /� mice were treated daily with
trazodone, DBM or vehicle from 7 weeks post-infection, a
time point when early degenerative changes—specifically
synapse loss and spongiosis—are established, and which
are considered equivalent to early stage symptoms of cog-
nitive impairment in humans (Moreno et al., 2012). We
used tg37 + /� mice, as opposed to wild-type, in these as
in
our
previous
experiments,
as
we
have
previously
shown UPR activation occurs in both strains, with identical
effects on protein synthesis rates and clinical signs and
neuronal loss, differing only in time course of disease
(Moreno et al., 2012). In line with local animal husbandry
guidelines, we use the mice with shorter disease course.
All mice were observed for effects of treatment with tra-
zodone or DBM compared to vehicle on their clinical pro-
gression. Clinically confirmed prion disease in mice (which
is terminal) is diagnosed by the appearance of a range of
clinical signs indicative of neurological disease. These in-
clude the appearance of at least one of several possible
early indicator signs (which are on their own non-specific)
in combination with at least one of several possible con-
firmatory signs (Table 1). Confirmatory signs occur later in
disease, when neuronal loss is advanced, and at least one is
required for diagnosis. (Some, for example, impaired right-
ing reflex occur more commonly than others). All 20 prion-
infected mice treated with vehicle developed one or more
confirmatory clinical signs and succumbed to prion infec-
tion in 83 � 2 days (Table 1), consistent with previous data
(Mallucci et al., 2002, 2003; Moreno et al., 2012, 2013;
Halliday et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2015). Remarkably,
both trazodone and DBM treatment prevented the appear-
ance of confirmatory neurological signs diagnostic of clin-
ical prion disease in majority of treated animals. Twelve of
15 (80%) prion-infected mice treated with trazodone and
16/21 mice (71%) treated with DBM, did not show diag-
nostic neurological signs of prion disease at the point of
culling. While all animals developed non-specific early
signs, most of these were not sustained and only 3/15
mice (trazodone) and 6/21 mice (DBM) progressed to de-
velop prion confirmatory neurological signs.
Thus, both trazodone and DBM prevented development
of neurological disease in the majority of treated animals:
those animals developing confirmatory clinical signs and
succumbing to prion infection may have received lower
doses of drug, particularly in the DBM group, where
drug levels were dependent on food consumption and
varied between mice.
Trazodone and dibenzoylmethane
prevent neurodegeneration and
rescue behavioural deficits in
prion-infected mice without
pancreatic toxicity
Consistent with clinical efficacy of trazodone and DBM in
preventing clinical signs of neurodegeneration, both drugs
were markedly neuroprotective at the histological level in
prion-infected mice. Thus, both drugs substantially reduced
neuronal loss in the hippocampus in those mice in which
they prevented neurological signs of prion disease. In con-
trast, vehicle-treated mice had extensive atrophy of CA1-3
hippocampal cells at the time of sacrifice, when they also
had confirmed clinical diagnosis of prion disease. This is
markedly different to the protective effects of both trazo-
done and DBM treatment on hippocampal morphology
and integrity [Fig. 3B(ii–iv) and (vi–viii)]. Indeed, neur-
onal
counts
from
CA1
regions
confirmed
significant
protective effects of both trazodone and DBM (Fig. 3C).
Critically, neither drug produced any pancreatic toxicity of
either
endocrine
or
exocrine
tissue
[Fig.
3B(ix–xii),
Supplementary Fig. 3A and B]. Both compounds rescued
the loss of object recognition memory at 9 weeks post-in-
fection (Fig. 3D), and DBM also prevented loss of burrow-
ing behaviour characteristic of prion infection at 9 and 10
weeks post-infection (Moreno et al., 2012, 2013) (Fig. 3E).
(Trazodone treatment precluded testing for burrowing ac-
tivity due to effects of sedation immediately after dosing,
reducing spontaneous activity. Sedation was not sustained,
but nonetheless it did not permit testing within the relevant
period).
Trazodone and dibenzoylmethane
significantly increase survival in
prion-infected mice
Importantly, both drugs significantly increased lifespan in
the 12/15 trazodone-treated and 15/21 DBM-treated ani-
mals that did not show neurological signs of prion infection
(P = 0.0103) (Fig. 3F). However, the increase in lifespan
was less prolonged than would have been expected, given
both the lack of diagnostic signs of prion disease seen clin-
ically (Table 1) and the extent of neuroprotection seen his-
tologically (Fig. 3B). This occurred as, in accordance with
UK Home Office regulations, these mice had to be culled
because of weight loss of 20% of their original body
weight, despite being devoid of neurological signs of
prion disease and being otherwise in every way clinically

 well (Fig. 3G). This very likely masked probable much
longer-lasting clinical efficacy of treatment with trazodone
or DBM. Importantly, weight loss was not an effect of
treatment with trazodone or DBM in itself. Control mice,
inoculated with normal brain homogenate and treated with
the drugs over the same time period, did not lose weight
(Fig. 3G). Further, the rTg4510 tauopathy mice did not
lose weight with trazodone or DBM treatment (Fig. 4G),
even though treatment lasted for several months before the
animals were sacrificed for analysis.
Thus, it appears that loss of body mass is a feature of
systemic prion infection (albeit not associated with other
signs of ill-health), which we have previously also described
with ISRIB treatment (Halliday et al., 2015). With both
trazodone and DBM, as with ISRIB, this feature of prion
infection is dissociated from the neuroprotective effects of
treatment.
Trazodone and dibenzoylmethane
restore protein synthesis down-
stream of eIF2a-P in prion-
diseased mice
The site of action of both compounds in vivo is down-
stream of eIF2�-P, in agreement with our in vitro findings.
Thus, elevated eIF2�-P levels in prion-diseased hippocampi
were unchanged by treatment with trazodone and DBM,
while ATF4 levels were reduced (Fig. 3H), replicating our
observations in vitro (Fig. 2B and D). Consistent with this,
both drugs increased protein synthesis rates in ex vivo hip-
pocampal slices compared to �60% reduction in protein
synthesis rates seen in the brains of vehicle-treated animals
(Fig. 3I). DBM and trazodone treatment had no effect on
the levels of misfolded PrP levels (PrPSc) (Fig. 3J), consistent
with the fact that neuroprotection is likely due to effects on
eIF2�-P signalling, not on prion replication.
Trazodone and dibenzoylmethane
are neuroprotective in the rTg4510
model of frontotemporal dementia
PERK branch UPR activation is seen in human tauopathies,
including Alzheimer’s disease and progressive supranuclear
palsy (Hoozemans et al., 2009; Stutzbach et al., 2013). We
thus tested trazodone and DBM in a mouse model of tauo-
pathy. rTg4510 mice overexpress the human tau mutation
P301L associated with FTD, with onset of tau pathology
from 3 months of age (Santacruz et al., 2005). Raised
eIF2�-P and ATF4 levels and a decline in protein synthesis
rates, associated with the onset of neurodegeneration, occur
at between 5–6 months of age, becoming severe—with
marked forebrain atrophy—by 8 months of age (Fig. 4A).

(Radford et al., 2015). Thus, tauP301L
+ mice received tra-
zodone or DBM daily from 4 months and were examined
at 8 months, when neuronal loss is advanced in the CA1
region of untreated (vehicle-treated) mice compared to
transgene negative tauP301L

of

hippocampus
in
tauP301L
+
mice
(Fig.

(Ramsden et al., 2005; Santacruz et al., 2005). Trazodone
and DBM reduced hippocampal atrophy in rTg4510 mice
compared to vehicle treatment, where this was pronounced
[Fig. 4B, cf. (ii), (iii) and (iv), and Fig. 4C]. They were
notably neuroprotective in the hippocampus, significantly
reducing loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons compared to
tauP301L
+ mice treated with vehicle [Fig. 4B, cf. (vi), (vii)
and (viii), and Fig. 4C]. As in the prion-infected mice, treat-
ment was not toxic to the pancreas [Fig. 4B(xiii–xvi),
Supplementary Fig. 3C and D]. Both compounds rescued
the loss of object recognition memory at 5 months. (Fig.
4D). Trazodone also produced a reduction in p-tau staining
at 8 months compared to vehicle- or DBM-treated mice
[Fig. 4B, cf. (xi) to (x) or (xii), and Fig. 4E]. This is
likely due to inhibition of the tau kinase GSK3b by phos-
phorylation at Ser9 induced by trazodone (Supplementary
Fig. 4) (Radford et al., 2015). The life-span of rTg4510
mice is long (Ramsden et al., 2005), so survival studies
were not possible as an outcome of treatment, but the ef-
fects on hippocampal volume and neuronal integrity and
on the general condition of the mice was marked with both
drugs. Of note, both drugs were well tolerated for the dur-
ation
of
the
experiment—several
months
treatment.
Importantly, drug treatment did not have any effect on
weight loss (Fig. 4F).
As in prion-infected mice, both compounds reduced

stream of eIF2�-P, as seen in vitro (Fig. 2B and D).

Discussion
There is a tremendous unmet clinical need for effective
pharmacological interventions against protein-misfolding
neurodegenerative
disorders
such
as
Alzheimer’s
and
Parkinson’s diseases. The PERK branch of the UPR, in par-
ticular, has emerged as a promising new therapeutic target
in these disorders, due to its overactivation in human
Alzheimer’s disease brain tissue and mechanistic implica-
tions from disease models (Hetz et al., 2013; Halliday
and Mallucci, 2014). Thus, in preclinical models, many
lines of evidence support increased signalling via eIF2�-
P—and
the
ensuing
attenuation
of
protein
synthesis
rates—as contributing to cognitive impairment and disease
progression (Moreno et al., 2012, 2013; Ma et al., 2013;
Devi and Ohno, 2014; Kim et al., 2014; Halliday et al.,
2015; Radford et al., 2015). Moreover, two compounds,
the PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 (Moreno et al., 2013)
and the ISR inhibitor ISRIB (Halliday et al., 2015) have
been shown to interfere with the translational inhibitory
effects of increased eIF2� phosphorylation (acting upstream
and downstream of eIF2�-P, respectively). Both of these
compounds have been shown to have significant neuropro-
tective effects in mouse models of neurodegeneration, redu-
cing disease progression (Moreno et al., 2013; Halliday
et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2015). GSK2606414 also im-
proves neuronal phenotypes in fly models of disease (Kim
et al., 2014; Celardo et al., 2016). Further, ISRIB boosts
cognition
in
wild-type
mice
(Sidrauski
et
al.,
2013).
However, neither of these substances is suitable for trans-
lation to treatment of human disease, due to associated
toxicity (GSK2606414) or insolubility (ISRIB) (Moreno
et al., 2013; Halliday et al., 2015). There is therefore an
urgent need to find safe compounds with similar thera-
peutic effects to test the potential efficacy of this approach
in human disease. This need drove us to develop new
screens to find potential repurposable drugs for translation
to the clinic as new disease-modifying treatments for
dementia.
The development of experimental models amenable to
live animal compound screening is an attractive approach
for discovering effective pharmacological therapies. Drug
screens are often a balance between choosing the most bio-
logically relevant readout, and maintaining a high-enough
throughput to remain useful. We chose the nematode worm
C. elegans for our primary in vivo screen due to the worms’
quick generational time, the ability to breed hundreds of
developmentally synchronized animals for testing and easily
observable phenotypes. Importantly, the UPR is conserved
across metazoa, and C. elegans contains orthologues of all
the major UPR genes. Tunicamycin induces developmental
arrest in the worms at stages L2/L3. This likely occurs as
they normally greatly increase in size between the L2 and
L3 stages, requiring large amounts of new protein synthe-
sis, which is attenuated by tunicamycin (Supplementary Fig.
1). Due to the large difference in size between worms that
were stalled at the L2 stage and older worms that had

Prion-infected mice were treated daily with trazodone, DBM or vehicle from 7 weeks post-infection, by which stage early neurological prion disease is established and significant
synapse loss occurs (Moreno et al., 2012). All mice were assessed for appearance of one or more of both early indicator and confirmatory signs of neurological prion disease
(‘scrapie’). One confirmatory sign and 42 early indicator signs or two confirmatory signs are required for the diagnosis of clinically definite prion disease. All vehicle-treated animals
(n = 20) had confirmatory signs of terminal prion disease by 83 � 2 days. Only 3/15 trazodone-treated and 6/21 DBM-treated mice developed neurologically definite clinical prion
disease (83 � 4 and 84 � 4 days, respectively). The remaining mice showed no confirmatory neurological clinical signs. Other than the occurrence of one or more non-specific early
indicator signs, which were mostly transient, they were clinically well.

 overcome
the
developmental
block,
compounds
that
exerted
any
beneficial
effects
were
easily
observed
(Supplementary Table 1). We used a NINDS Custom
Collection 2 drug library including mostly FDA-approved
drugs, many of which were known to be brain-penetrant
and neurologically active in humans. Twenty of the 1040
NINDS compounds overcame the developmental delay in
tunicamycin-stressed worms and were therefore potential
UPR inhibitors (Supplementary Table 1). However, this
screen did not determine whether the drugs were direct
inhibitors of the UPR. The upregulation of chaperones, or
the drugs themselves acting as chemical chaperones, could
similarly facilitate normal development in the worms. We
therefore
screened
the
20
hits
in
mammalian
CHO
CHOP::luciferase cells to test for inhibition of PERK-
mediated UPR signalling (Fig. 1A and B). Five of the 20
compounds repressed CHOP::luciferase signalling induced
by tunicamycin. Of these, trazodone, a licensed anti-depres-
sant safe to use in the elderly, with excellent oral pharma-
cokinetic profile and excellent safety profile and DBM, a
curcumin analogue with notable anti-cancer properties in
preclinical
models,
were
the
best
candidates
to
take
forward.
Trazodone is an antidepressant in the serotonin antagon-
ist and reuptake inhibitor class, which has additional
anxiolytic and hypnotic effects. It has been shown to
reduce the behavioural and psychological symptoms of de-
mentia (BPSD) in Alzheimer’s disease (Lopez-Pousa et al.,
2008) and in FTD (Lebert et al., 2004), but no studies have
looked at the progression of neurodegeneration with trazo-
done treatment. Although its pharmacological actions in
humans are not fully understood, it is thought to have
more than one mechanism of therapeutic action, making
it a multifunctional drug. It is the first antidepressant
with a dual mechanism of action involving inhibition of
the serotonin transporter (SERT) and antagonism of the
serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) receptor, producing its anti-
depressant effect by blocking SERT, and increasing sero-
tonin
concentrations
in
the
brain.
Trazodone
exerts
antagonistic properties against �1- and �2-adrenergic re-
ceptors and histamine H1 receptors, with minimal anti-
cholinergic
effects
(Monti
et
al.,
1986;
Stahl,
2009).
Trazodone has previously shown benefit in models of
Huntington’s disease, where it improved mitochondrial re-
spiratory complex activity (Kumar et al., 2011) and Morris
water maze performance (Kumar et al., 2010)
DBM is a minor constituent of liquorice that has been
found to have antineoplastic effects, with efficacy against
prostate and mammary tumours (Huang et al., 1998; Khor
et al., 2009). Carcinogen detoxification has been proposed
as a possible mechanism of action as DBM has been re-
ported to potently induce phase 2 hepatic detoxification
enzymes (Dinkova-Kostova and Talalay, 1999). DBM has
also been reported to induce the Nrf2 survival pathway
(Thimmulappa et al., 2008), which is activated downstream
of UPR activation (He et al., 2001). DBM has also been
shown to upregulate GRP78/BiP (Frazier et al., 2004).
DBM derivatives have been shown to induce protection
from necrotic cell death (Hegedus et al., 2013) and protect
dopaminergic neurons against both oxidative stress and
endoplasmic reticulum stress (Takano et al., 2007). It is
unclear
if
DBM
itself
shares
these
effects
with
its
derivatives.
In this study, we found that both trazodone and DBM
inhibited the effects of UPR activation and eIF2� phosphor-
ylation, reversing translational attenuation and lowering
levels of ATF4 and CHOP in mammalian cells (Figs 1A
and 2B). This occurred without lowering eIF2�-P levels
in vitro (Fig. 2B), and in vivo (Figs 3H and 4G), as
has been described for ISRIB (Halliday et al., 2015;
Sekine et al., 2015; Sidrauski et al., 2015). Both trazodone
and
DBM
prevented
eIF2�-P
from
lowering
ternary
complex levels, due to their ability to reduce ATF4 5’UTR
regulation of luciferase (Fig. 2D), but this was via an
independent
mechanism
than
that
of
ISRIB
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Based on their ability to reverse UPR activation, trazo-
done and DBM were predicted to be potential therapeutic
candidates for neurodegenerative disorders. Indeed, both
compounds were found to be substantially neuroprotective
in two different mouse models of neurodegeneration, prion
disease and the rTg4510 tauopathy model of FTD. Both
drugs showed beneficial neuroprotective effects similar to
those of the experimental compounds GSK2606414 and
ISRIB. Importantly, in both models, the drugs were first
administered at a stage of early but established disease,
equivalent to early symptomatic human disease—from 7
weeks post-infection in prion-disease mice and from 4
months of age in tauopathy mice. Treatment with each
drug prevented neuronal loss in the hippocampus (Fig. 3B
and C) and confirmatory neurological clinical signs (Table
1) in the majority of prion-infected mice, also restoring
memory and preventing behavioural decline associated
with prion infection (Fig. 3D and E). In tauopathy mice,
both drugs were strongly protective against the marked
hippocampal neuronal loss and forebrain atrophy that is

 a feature of this mouse model (Fig. 4B and C). These mice
were also devoid of clinical signs of neurodegeneration.
There was also significant increase in lifespan of prion-in-
fected mice treated with trazodone or DBM (Fig. 3F), al-
though
this
was
more
modest
than
was
expected
considering the neuroprotection observed, due to coinciden-
tal weight loss requiring early sacrifice of otherwise entirely
healthy animals (Fig. 3G). This weight loss was not caused
by trazodone or DBM (Figs 3G and 4F), which, critically,
were also devoid of pancreatic toxicity [Figs 3B(ix–xii),
4B(xiii–xvi) and Supplementary Fig. 2), likely because
both compounds only partially reverse eIF2�-P-mediated
translational attenuation (Fig. 1A and B), which is asso-
ciated with lack of toxicity to secretory tissue (Halliday
et al., 2015). Thus, neither trazodone nor DBM suffer
from the shortcomings of GSK2606414 and ISRIB: they
are non-toxic to the pancreas and have favourable pharma-
cokinetic properties. Critically, however, they share the
benefits
of
GSK2606414
and
ISRIB,
being
markedly
neuroprotective.
Interestingly,
another
unanticipated
and
previously
unreported action of trazodone was to lower phosphory-
lated (p)-tau levels in rTg4510 mice (Fig. 4B, E and
Supplementary
Fig.
4).
P-tau
is
associated
with
Alzheimer’s disease pathology and with the tauopathies
FTD and progressive supranuclear palsy, and is in itself
an intense focus for Alzheimer’s therapeutics. This add-
itional effect of trazodone could be considered a desirable
bonus in the treatment of these disorders. UPR activation is
known to induce tau phosphorylation via activation of
GSK3b (Nijholt et al., 2013) and treatment with the
PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 also lowers tau phosphoryl-
ation (van der Harg et al., 2014; Radford et al., 2015).
Trazodone
was
also
able
to
inhibit
GSK3b
(Supplementary Fig. 4). However, the similar degree of
neuroprotection
afforded
by
trazodone
and
DBM
(Table 1, Figs 3B, C, 4B and C) suggests that reduction
of the stress response downstream of eIF2�-P and partial
restoration of protein synthesis is the primary driver of
neuroprotection
in
both
tauopathy and prion-diseased
mice. This is irrespective of sustained high levels of mis-
folded protein, both prion (Fig. 3J) and p-tau (in DBM
treated mice; Fig. 4B and E), further demonstrating the
central role the UPR plays in neurodegeneration.
In conclusion, we selected trazodone and DBM as poten-
tial therapeutic agents in neurodegenerative disease, based
on their consistent ability to inhibit UPR/ISR-induced trans-
lational repression, rather than target disease-specific mis-
folded proteins, in organisms ranging from nematodes,
through
mammalian
cell
models,
to
different
mouse
models of neurodegeneration. The two drugs were mark-
edly neuroprotective in both prion-diseased and FTD mice
at clinically relevant doses over a sustained treatment
period. These drugs therefore represent an important step
forward in the pursuit of disease-modifying treatments for
Alzheimer’s and related disorders. Trazodone in particular,
is already licensed for use in elderly patients. These drugs
should now be tested in clinical trials in the treatment of
dementia.
