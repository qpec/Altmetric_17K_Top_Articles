Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is more commonly diagnosed in males than in females.
A growing body of research suggests that females with ADHD might be underdiagnosed or receive alternative
diagnoses, such as anxiety or depression. Other lines of reasoning suggest that females might be protected from
developing ADHD, requiring a higher burden of genetic risk to manifest the disorder. Methods: We tested these two
hypotheses, using common variant genetic data from two population-based cohorts. First, we tested whether females
and males diagnosed with anxiety or depression differ in terms of their genetic risk for ADHD, assessed as polygenic
risk scores (PRS). Second, we tested whether females and males with ADHD differed in ADHD genetic risk burden. We
used three different diagnostic definitions: registry-based clinical diagnoses, screening-based research diagnoses
and algorithm-based research diagnoses, to investigate possible referral biases. Results: In individuals with a
registry-based clinical diagnosis of anxiety or depression, females had higher ADHD PRS than males [OR(CI) = 1.39
(1.12–1.73)] but there was no sex difference for screening-based [OR(CI) = 1.15 (0.94–1.42)] or algorithm-based [OR
(CI) = 1.04 (0.89–1.21)] diagnoses. There was also no sex difference in ADHD PRS in individuals with ADHD
diagnoses that were registry-based [OR(CI) = 1.04 (0.84–1.30)], screening-based [OR(CI) = 0.96 (0.85–1.08)] or
algorithm-based [OR(CI) = 1.15 (0.78–1.68)]. Conclusions: This study provides genetic evidence that ADHD risk may
be more likely to manifest or be diagnosed as anxiety or depression in females than in males. Contrary to some earlier
studies, the results do not support increased ADHD genetic risk in females with ADHD as compared to affected
males. Keywords: ADHD; anxiety; depression; genetics; CATSS; ALSPAC.
Introduction
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a
common and impairing disorder, with a prevalence
of approximately 5% in childhood (Polanczyk, de
Lima, Horta, Biederman, & Rohde, 2007). ADHD is a
neurodevelopmental
disorder,
characterised
by
onset in childhood, male bias and high levels of
comorbidity with other neurodevelopmental (e.g.
autism spectrum disorder) and psychiatric (e.g.
anxiety, depression) phenotypes (Thapar, Cooper, &
Rutter, 2017). Although childhood ADHD is 2–9
times more prevalent in males (Nussbaum, 2012;
Polanczyk et al., 2007), it is unclear how and why
this sex bias is observed.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnostic
criteria are potentially more geared towards identi-
fying symptoms typical in males, given that field
trials for establishing diagnostic criteria were based
on a sample including only 21% females (Lahey
et al., 1994). As the male bias is more pronounced in
clinically ascertained samples than in population-
based samples (Nussbaum, 2012), it is likely that
females are routinely underdiagnosed with ADHD
and that phenotypic differences, referral or diagnos-
tic biases (e.g. professional awareness or diagnostic
substitution) play a role. In community samples,
females meeting ADHD criteria generally present
with less severe ADHD symptom profiles and fewer
comorbid problems than affected males; in contrast,
clinical studies find few sex differences, although
females show more impairment from inattentive
symptoms (Gaub & Carlson, 1997; Gershon, 2002).
This pattern of less distinctive sex differences in
clinically ascertained compared to nonclinical sam-
ples further suggests that ADHD may be underdiag-
nosed in females compared to males.
Literature reviews have generally concluded that
females are more likely than males to present with
inattentive, rather than hyperactive-impulsive symp-
toms, as well as comorbid anxiety/depression; con-
versely, the combined subtype of ADHD is more
common in males, who more frequently present with
comorbid conduct-related behaviours (Quinn, 2008;
Quinn & Madhoo, 2014; Rucklidge, 2010; Staller &
Faraone, 2006; Willcutt, 2012). Thus, research sug-
gests that the presentation and associated comor-
bidities of ADHD may differ by sex.
It has been suggested that ADHD may be under-
diagnosed in females due to the less overt nature of
inattentive symptoms, as well as possible diagnostic

 overshadowing from anxiety, eating or depressive
disorders (Quinn, 2008; Quinn & Madhoo, 2014).
Furthermore, the male-to-female ratio for ADHD is
much reduced in adults (nearer to 1:1), possibly
indicating a delay in females receiving ADHD diag-
noses (Faraone et al., 2015). The pattern of symp-
tomatic sex differences in diagnosed females and
males from clinically referred and population child-
hood samples is consistent with a greater symptom
threshold requirement for ADHD referral of females.
This suggests that only the most severely affected
females are referred for clinical assessment and
diagnosed with ADHD in childhood. Less severely
affected females, who nonetheless manifest ADHD
traits above the diagnostic threshold and experience
impairment, might instead receive alternative diag-
noses (Quinn, 2008).
To date, no study has directly examined the
contribution of genetic risk factors to putative sex-
specific diagnostic biases. ADHD is highly heritable,
with heritability estimated at ~70%–80% (Faraone
et al., 2015). A recent ADHD genome-wide associa-
tion study (GWAS) meta-analysis identified the first
robust
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(SNPs)
associated with ADHD and estimated a SNP-based
heritability of approximately 22% (Demontis et al.,
2017). Sex-stratified genetic analyses have shown
that the SNP-based genetic correlation for ADHD in
males and females is very high (close to 1), suggest-
ing that largely the same common genetic risk
variants contribute to ADHD in both sexes (Martin
et al., 2017). Molecular studies have also shown that
common risk variants are shared between ADHD
and major depressive disorder (genetic correlation
(rg) = .26),
depressive
symptoms
(rg = .45)
and
anxiety disorders (rg = .40) (Anttila et al., 2017;
Demontis et al., 2017). Twin studies have similarly
reported shared genetic risk between ADHD and
internalising problems (additive genetic correlation
(rA) = .45), depression (rA = .67–.77), affective prob-
lems (rA = .34–.48) and anxiety (rA = .45–.58) (Chen
et al., 2016; Cole, Ball, Martin, Scourfield, & Mcguf-
fin, 2009; Michelini, Eley, Gregory, & McAdams,
2015; Rydell, Taylor, & Larsson, 2017). However
unlike ADHD, there is a female excess in depression
and anxiety (Craske et al., 2017; Weissman et al.,
1996). These observations raise the possibility that
ADHD genetic risk manifests differently in females
and males in the general population, for example as
anxiety or depression in females.
Although referral and diagnostic biases are poten-
tially an important contributing factor to observed
sex differences in ADHD prevalence, they are unli-
kely to fully explain this difference. Whole popula-
tion-based
screens
for
ADHD
consistently
find
higher mean ADHD symptoms in males (Larsson,
Anckarsater, R�
astam, Chang, & Lichtenstein, 2011;
Martin, Hamshere, Stergiakouli, O’Donovan, & Tha-
par, 2014; Nussbaum, 2012), suggesting that other
factors also contribute to the sex bias in prevalence.
One alternative hypothesis is that females are in
some way resilient to developing ADHD, a theory
known as the ‘female protective effect’ (Taylor et al.,
2016). Indeed, several family studies have reported
that first-degree relatives of affected females are at
increased risk of ADHD, compared to relatives of
affected males (Martin et al., 2017; Rhee & Wald-
man, 2004; Smalley et al., 2000; Taylor et al., 2016).
This is indirect evidence for a higher burden of
genetic risk in females diagnosed with ADHD and
their relatives. However the evidence is mixed, with
two studies not finding this effect (Chen et al., 2017;
Faraone, 2000). Also, although molecular genetic
studies (one clinical and one population-based)
found a higher burden of common risk variants in
females with ADHD (Hamshere et al., 2013; Martin
et al., 2014), a much larger clinical ADHD study
reported no sex difference in ADHD common variant
burden (Martin et al., 2017). Additional replication
of genetic burden analysis is needed in population-
based samples.
The aim of this study was to test two related
hypotheses for the sex-biased prevalence of ADHD
using Swedish and British population-based cohort
studies. First, we hypothesised that ADHD genetic
risk is more strongly associated with anxiety or
depression diagnoses in females than males. Sec-
ond, we hypothesised that females with ADHD have
an increased burden of ADHD genetic risk as com-
pared to diagnosed males. To test these hypotheses,
we examined whether in individuals who had anxi-
ety, depression or ADHD diagnoses, females had a
higher burden of ADHD genetic risk than males,
using polygenic risk scores.
Method
Description of samples and measures
CATSS.
The Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden
(CATSS) is a population study of all twin children born in
Sweden since July 1992 (Anckars€
ater et al., 2012). Since
2004, the cohort is being recruited when twins turn 9 years
old. They are assessed at ages 9, 15, 18 and 24 years using
parent telephone interviews and postal/Internet question-
naires. Initially, families with 12-year-old twins were also
recruited. Parents gave informed consent to participate in the
study on behalf of themselves and their children. The study
was approved by the Karolinska Institutet Ethical Review
Board in Stockholm.
DNA samples (from saliva) have been collected since 2008
from the participants at initial recruitment to the study.
Samples were genotyped using the Illumina PsychChip geno-
typing chip. Standard quality control (QC) and imputation
procedures were performed in the sample; for details see
(Brikell et al., 2017). N = 13,576 samples and N = 6,981,993
imputed SNPs passed QC. Children with brain damage/injury
or
chromosomal
abnormalities
were
excluded.
This
left
N = 13,472 children included in analyses.
Information on ADHD, anxiety and depression was available
from two sources: registry-based clinical diagnoses as well as
parent- and twin-rated screening measures (hereafter referred
to as ‘screening-based research diagnoses’). Notably, the
registry-based diagnoses are subject to potential referral and

 diagnostic biases, whereas the screening-based diagnoses are
less likely to be affected by sex-specific biases.
Data on clinical diagnoses given by specialist services were
obtained from the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR)
through linkage using each individual’s personal identification
number. The NPR contains information on inpatient psychi-
atric care from 1987 and specialist outpatient consultations
from 2001. It includes best-estimate specialist diagnoses
according to ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases
version-10) codes (WHO, 1993). ICD codes (including sub-
headings) were obtained for the following diagnoses: ADHD/
hyperkinetic disorder (F90), social anxiety and phobias (F40),
generalised anxiety and panic disorders (F41), separation
anxiety and other childhood-onset anxiety disorders (F93),
single and recurrent major depressive disorders (F32-F34).
Diagnoses were collapsed into four binary variables: ADHD,
any anxiety disorder, any depressive disorder, and any anxiety
or depressive disorder. At the end of follow-up (2014), the
individuals in this cohort study were aged between 9 and
22 years old. Individuals diagnosed with depression prior to
age 13 were excluded from analyses, as the typical onset of
depression is during adolescence and adulthood (Weissman
et al., 1996).
As part of the CATSS research study, parents completed the
Autism-Tics, ADHD and Other Comorbidities inventory (A-
TAC) (Hansson et al., 2005) over the telephone, when the
children were aged 9 or 12 years old. ADHD was assessed
using two modules: inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity,
corresponding to the 18 DSM items for childhood ADHD, and
one additional item related to boredom, scored on a 3-point
scale (total possible range = 0–19). This ADHD measure has
been reported to have good construct validity, with an area
under the curve of 0.90, sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of
0.73 for detecting a broad screening proxy of ADHD (score ≥ 6)
(Larson et al., 2010). Study individuals were also screened for
anxiety and depression at age 18. Parents rated symptoms of
anxiety (6 items) and depression (15 items) in their children,
using
the
Adult
Behavior
Checklist
(ABCL)
(Achenbach,
Dumenci, & Rescorla, 2003) and the twins self-reported on
anxiety, using the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional
Disorders (SCARED) (Birmaher et al., 1997), and on depres-
sion, using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale (CES-D) (Radloff, 1977). Total scores on each instrument
were dichotomised so that the top 5% of responders were
classed as being affected, to ensure that the most severely
affected individuals were captured, while maximising statisti-
cal power.
ALSPAC.
The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
Children (ALSPAC) is a large, well-characterised longitudinal
study (Boyd et al., 2013; Fraser et al., 2013). ALSPAC origi-
nally recruited N = 14,541 pregnant women resident in Avon,
England, with expected delivery dates between 1 April 1991,
and 31 December 1992. An additional 713 eligible children
were enrolled after age 7, resulting in a total sample of
N = 14,701 children alive at age 1 year. The study website
(http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/da
ta-dictionary/) contains details of all available data through a
fully searchable data dictionary. Ethics approval was obtained
from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and Local
Research Ethics Committees.
Children from triplet and quadruplet births were excluded
and only one child from twin births was included in genotyp-
ing. N = 9,912 ALSPAC children were genotyped using the
Illumina
HumanHap550
quad
SNP
genotyping
platform.
Detailed QC procedures
have
been published previously
(Martin et al., 2014). After QC, genome-wide data were avail-
able for N = 8,215 children and N = 1,813,169 imputed SNPs.
Unlike in CATSS, information on ADHD, anxiety and
depression was not available from national registers, only from
parent- and child-rated screening measures. In ALSPAC, these
screening measures also included information on impairment
and were used to derive algorithm-based research diagnoses.
Psychiatric
disorders
were
assessed
at
multiple
time
points using a semistructured interview, the Development
and
Well-Being
Assessment
(DAWBA)
(Goodman,
Ford,
Richards, Gatward, & Meltzer, 2000), which assesses symp-
toms and impairment. Parents completed the DAWBA ADHD,
anxiety and depression sections when their children were
aged 7, 10, 13 and 15 years (N.B. only ADHD section
completed at 15) and adolescents completed the anxiety
and depression sections at age 15 years. Computer-gener-
ated DAWBA band variables predict the probability of a
psychiatric disorder being present (Goodman,
Heiervang,
Collishaw, & Goodman, 2011). Following recommendations,
>50% probability of diagnosis was classed as ‘diagnosis likely
present’ and lower levels as ‘diagnosis likely absent’. These
bands have been well-validated in community samples of
British and Norwegian children, showing excellent agreement
with clinician-rated diagnoses (Goodman et al., 2011). Par-
ticipants also completed the CIS-R (Clinical Interview Sched-
ule-Revised)
(Lewis,
Pelosi,
Araya,
&
Dunn,
1992),
a
computerised interview to assess anxiety and depression, at
age 18 years. Algorithms based on ICD-10 criteria were used
to derive binary variables. DAWBA-based anxiety disorders
included generalised anxiety disorder, separation anxiety
disorder, specific phobias and social phobia at ages 7, 10
and
13 years
(parent-rated).
These
same
disorders
were
available at ages 15 and 18 years (adolescent-rated), except
that participants were not asked about separation anxiety
disorder but were asked about panic disorder and agora-
phobia. Depressive diagnoses prior to age 13 were not used.
Individuals with a diagnosis at any time point were classed
as ‘diagnosis present’ and those without a diagnosis at all
time points were classed as ‘diagnosis absent’.
Polygenic risk scores
Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were derived using the standard
method (The International Schizophrenia Consortium, 2009),
based on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 19,099
ADHD cases and 34,194 controls. See Data S1 for details. In
brief, PRS were calculated for each individual by scoring the
number of alleles (weighted by the allele effect size) across the
ADHD discovery set of SNPs. PRS were standardised using z-
score transformations; odds ratios can be interpreted as
increase in risk of the outcome, per standard deviation in PRS.
Data analytic strategy
We first examined the overall association between ADHD PRS
and presence of ADHD, anxiety and depression diagnoses. To
test the first hypothesis that ADHD genetic risk is more
strongly associated with anxiety or depression in females, we
tested the association between ADHD PRS and sex in individ-
uals with diagnosed anxiety, depression or either disorder.
Assuming that individuals with comorbid diagnoses of ADHD
and anxiety or depression have a more complex clinical
presentation, we conducted sensitivity analyses excluding
individuals
with
diagnosed
ADHD
(CATSS
registry-based
diagnoses and ALSPAC algorithm-based diagnoses). To test
the second hypothesis, that females with ADHD have an
increased burden of ADHD genetic risk, we examined the
association between ADHD PRS and sex, in children with
ADHD.
Analyses in CATSS were run using generalised estimating
equations in R (drgee package), using family ID to cluster the
data to account for related samples, adjusting for age. In
ALSPAC, analyses were run using logistic regression models.
Males were the reference sex, coded as ‘0’ and females were
coded as ‘1’ for all analyses.

 Secondary analyses
The main analyses were repeated using ADHD PRS derived
using alternative p-value thresholds to examine the sensitivity
of the results.
To determine whether putative diagnostic biases are asso-
ciated with a delay in obtaining an ADHD diagnosis in females,
we tested in CATSS whether age at first diagnosis (calculated
as: [first_diagnosis_date – birth_year]/365.25) was associated
with sex. We also tested whether including age at first
diagnosis as a covariate affected the results.
To determine whether sex differences in severity of symp-
toms affected the registry-based results in CATSS, analyses
were adjusted for screening-based measures of: (a) parent-
reported ADHD symptom severity and impairment, and (b)
parent- and self-reported anxiety and depression symptom
severity.
Results
The numbers of individuals with registry-based
(CATSS), screening-based (CATSS) and algorithm-
based (ALSPAC) diagnoses of ADHD, anxiety and
depression are shown in Table 1. ADHD PRS were
associated with increased risk for these diagnostic
categories, although the confidence intervals over-
lapped with 1 for the associations with clinical
diagnoses
of
depression
and
screening-based
research diagnoses of anxiety and depression sepa-
rately in CATSS (Table 1). Females were more likely
to have anxiety and depression (OR: 1.51–3.14) and
less likely to have ADHD (OR: 0.25–0.48) as com-
pared
to
males
(p < .002),
for
all
definitions
(Table S1).
ADHD genetic risk and sex, in those with anxiety or
depression
Table 2 displays the results of association analyses
between ADHD PRS and sex in individuals diag-
nosed with anxiety or depression. In CATSS, females
with registry-based clinical diagnoses had higher
ADHD PRS than diagnosed males, though the con-
fidence interval overlapped with 1 for depression.
When anxiety and depression were defined using
screening measures in each study, the estimates
were closer to 1 in both CATSS and ALSPAC. When
individuals with comorbid ADHD diagnoses were
excluded, the effect sizes of the association between
ADHD PRS and sex increased in CATSS individuals
with registry-based diagnoses of anxiety or depres-
sion (Table 2). This exclusion had no clear impact on
analyses using research-based diagnoses in either
study.
ADHD genetic risk and sex, in those with ADHD
There was no statistically significant difference in
ADHD PRS between females and males with ADHD,
for any ADHD diagnostic definition (Table 3).
Secondary analyses
Results using ADHD PRS derived based on different
p-value thresholds are shown in Figures S1–S3. The
pattern of results was similar to the main results.
In CATSS, females were older than males at first
registry-based
clinical
diagnosis
of
ADHD
[OR
(CI) = 1.11 (1.02–1.20)], with somewhat wider confi-
dence intervals for anxiety [OR (CI) = 1.14 (1.00–
1.29)] and much wider confidence intervals for
depression [OR (CI) = 0.93 (0.81–1.07)]. Including
age at first diagnosis as a covariate did not substan-
tially affect the results (Table S2).
In CATSS individuals with registry-based diag-
noses of anxiety or depression, males had more
ADHD symptoms and were more likely to have
impairment from ADHD symptoms, whereas females
had more self-reported anxiety and depressive symp-
toms at age 18, though parent-reported symptoms
did not differ by sex (Table S3). Adjusting the main

Discussion
The results of this study suggest that ADHD common
genetic risk burden is higher in females with clini-
cally recognised anxiety and depression than in
affected males, but that this finding does not extend
to diagnostic definitions based on whole sample
research screening in the general population. No sex
differences in ADHD genetic burden were found in
individuals with ADHD based on clinical or research
diagnostic definitions.
Consistent with studies showing genetic overlap
across ADHD and other psychiatric phenotypes (e.g.
Demontis et al., 2017), ADHD PRS were associated
with increased risk of anxiety and depression in
children from the general population, using a variety
of diagnostic definitions. When comparing polygenic
burden in females and males with clinical diagnoses
of anxiety or depression based on the Swedish
patient registry, females had higher ADHD PRS than
males. Excluding individuals receiving a comorbid
diagnosis of ADHD increased the strength of these
associations.
Increased
effect
sizes
were
also
observed when ADHD symptom severity and impair-
ment were included as covariates. One possible
interpretation of these results is that females at
genetic risk for ADHD may be underdiagnosed with
ADHD and instead diagnosed with other psychiatric
disorders such as anxiety or depression.
We did not see sex differences in ADHD PRS in
those with anxiety or depression defined using
research-based diagnoses in either sample. How-
ever, several important differences between mea-
sures need to be noted in order to interpret this
discrepancy.
The
research
diagnoses
in
CATSS
(screening-based)
and
ALSPAC
(algorithm-based)
are free from referral biases as they were obtained
for all individuals (albeit subject to potentially non-
random study attrition). In CATSS, high symptom
levels reported by parents or adolescents at age 18
were used as diagnostic proxies. In ALSPAC, com-
puter algorithms were applied to obtain a broad
indicator of parent- or adolescent-reported problems
across ages 7–18 years. In contrast, Swedish reg-
istry-based diagnoses are independent of the study
protocol and liable to referral and diagnostic biases;
they reflect ‘real-life’ clinician’s diagnoses, which are
more sensitive to factors such as impairment and
incorporate clinically relevant information from mul-
tiple informants. Despite these rather different diag-
nostic definitions, the sample sizes for comparisons
within diagnostic groups were similar so differences
in statistical power are unlikely to account for
differences in effect sizes.
However, given these measurement differences, it
is possible that the group of CATSS individuals who

 received registry-based diagnoses are more severely
affected compared to individuals meeting screening
cutoffs. Indeed, CATSS individuals who screened
positively for anxiety or depression at age 18 years
and also had registry-based diagnoses scored higher
on parent- and self-reported measures than those in
the screened group who had not received a registry-
based diagnosis (see Table S5). This could suggest
that there is no genetic difference in ADHD PRS by
sex based on research diagnoses in CATSS and
ALSPAC because sex differences are only present in
more severely affected individuals.
Another possibility is that females who received
registry-based
clinical
diagnoses
of
anxiety
or
depression were more severely affected than males
who received these diagnoses. In fact, the results
suggest that in those with anxiety or depression,
males had more ADHD symptoms and were more
likely to have reported impairment than females;
accounting for these variables increased the effect
sizes, as discussed above. On the other hand, in this
diagnosed group, females had higher levels of self-
reported anxiety and depression symptoms than
males; including these variables in the models
increased the effect size for the sex difference in
ADHD PRS in those with anxiety but decreased this
effect size in those with depression. This suggests
that differences in symptom severity may account for
the observed results for depression but not anxiety.
A limitation of this analysis was the reduced sample
size, which increased the confidence intervals. Also,
information on impairment from anxiety and depres-
sive symptoms was not available.
The results also showed that in individuals who
received
a
registry-based
diagnosis
of
ADHD,
females had a later age at first diagnosis than males.
This could suggest that there is a delay in obtaining
an ADHD diagnosis in females, which might be
reflected in the more similar sex ratio of ADHD seen
in adults (Faraone et al., 2015). However, it is also
possible that there is a genuine sex difference in
ADHD onset; future studies will need to examine this
possibility.
Bearing in mind the measurement differences and
secondary analyses discussed above, the results
suggest that females at genetic risk for ADHD may
be more likely to receive a clinical diagnosis of
anxiety or depression than ADHD as compared to
males. Given that there were no sex differences in
ADHD genetic risk in affected individuals for the
research-based diagnostic definitions where all indi-
viduals were carefully screened for these disorders,
this could suggest that referral or diagnostic biases
contribute to the sex difference in prevalence of
ADHD. Alternatively, genetic risk for ADHD may
simply manifest differently in males and females,
with females more likely to present with clinically
relevant anxiety and depression rather than ADHD.
We cannot distinguish between these two possibili-
ties in this study. Either way, these results may
partly explain the lower prevalence of ADHD seen in
females in clinical samples, although not necessarily
why mean differences in ADHD symptoms by sex are
observed in population-based samples.
We also examined the possibility of a female
protective effect in ADHD. In contrast to previous
studies (Hamshere et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2014),
we did not see any evidence for females with ADHD
(using several definitions) carrying a higher burden
of ADHD common risk variants. Notably, one of
these previous studies (Martin et al., 2014) also used
ALSPAC data and found consistently higher ADHD
PRS in females as compared to males, using a variety
of definitions of ADHD problems. However, this
previous study used a substantially smaller discov-
ery dataset (727 cases and 5,081 controls) for
calculating ADHD PRS, which may account for the
inconsistent results in the current study. Our results
are in line with a more recent, larger study that
found no sex difference in ADHD PRS in ADHD cases
(Martin et al., 2017). Although several family studies
support the female protective effect hypothesis by
finding a modest increased risk of ADHD in first-
degree relatives of affected females, compared to
relatives of affected males (Martin et al., 2017; Rhee
& Waldman, 2004; Smalley et al., 2000; Taylor
et al., 2016), there appears to be no strong or
consistent sex difference in ADHD polygenic burden.
The main strengths of this study rely on utilising
the largest available ADHD GWAS to calculate PRS
in two well-characterised population-based samples,
with several different (clinical and research) diag-
nostic definitions. However, the target sample sizes
of those with psychiatric diagnoses were low, limiting
statistical power, and the effect sizes were modest,
though typical for PRS studies of psychiatric pheno-
types (e.g. Demontis et al., 2017; Hamshere et al.,
2013; Martin et al., 2014). Also, as with all analyses
of longitudinal datasets, the study is limited by
possible attrition biases. Previous work suggests
that ALSPAC individuals with missing data have a
higher burden of genetic risk for schizophrenia,
although no sex bias was observed in availability of
genetic data (Martin et al., 2016). However, we
cannot entirely rule out the possibility that selective
attrition of those with more severe phenotypes or
higher genetic risk for ADHD biased our analyses of
research-based diagnoses. As the focus of the study
was on common autosomal variants, we cannot
extrapolate our findings to rare and sex chromoso-
mal variants.
Conclusion
This study provides genetic evidence that ADHD risk
may be more likely to manifest as anxiety or depres-
sion in referred females than in males and may
partly explain the lower prevalence of diagnosed
ADHD in females. Replication of these findings in
other population genetic datasets that have study-

 independent information for clinical diagnoses is
needed to confirm these results. This study suggests
that females presenting with clinical symptoms of
anxiety or depression might benefit from additional
careful screening for ADHD, particularly if they have
a family history of ADHD.

Key points
• ADHD is more commonly diagnosed in males than females in clinical and population samples.
• This general population study suggests that ADHD genetic risk might more commonly manifest as anxiety or
depression in females than in males.
• The results do not support an increased burden of common genetic risk variants in females with ADHD.
• Females at familial risk for ADHD, with anxiety and depression problems would benefit from careful screening
for ADHD.
