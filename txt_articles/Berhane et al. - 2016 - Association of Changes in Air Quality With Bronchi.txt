Abstract
Importance—Childhood bronchitic symptoms are significant public health and clinical problems 
that produce a substantial burden of disease. Ambient air pollutants are important determinants of 
bronchitis occurrence.
Objective—To determine if improvements in ambient air quality in Southern California were 
associated with reductions in bronchitic symptoms in children.
Design, Setting, and Participants—A longitudinal study was conducted on 4,602 children 
(spanning 5–18 years of age) from three cohorts during 1993–2001, 1996–2004 and 2003–2012 in 
eight Southern California communities. A multilevel logistic model was used to estimate the 
association of changes in pollution levels with bronchitic symptoms.
Exposures—Average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter 
with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10) and less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5)
Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)—Annual age-specific prevalence of bronchitic symptoms 
during the previous 12 months based on the parent’s or child’s report of a daily cough for 3 
months in a row, congestion or phlegm other than when accompanied by a cold, or bronchitis.
Results—The three cohorts included a total of 4602 children (mean age at baseline, 8.0 years; 
2268 (49.3%) girls; 2081 (45.2%) Hispanic white) who had data from two or more annual 
questionnaires. Among these children, 892 (19.4%) had asthma at age 10. For NO2, the odds ratio 
[OR] for bronchitic symptoms among children with asthma at age 10 was 0.79 (95% CI,0.67–
0.94) for median reduction of 4.9 ppb, with absolute decrease in prevalence of 10.1%. For O3, the 
OR was 0.66 (95% CI,0.50–0.86) for median reduction of 3.6 ppb, with absolute decrease in 
prevalence of 16.3%. For PM10, the OR was 0.61 (95% CI,0.48–0.78) for median reduction of 5.8 
μg/m3, with absolute decrease in prevalence of 18.7%. For PM2.5, the OR was 0.68 (95% CI,0.53–
0.86) for median reduction of 6.8 μg/m3, with absolute decrease in prevalence of 15.4%. Among 
children without asthma (N=3,710), the corresponding associations were: NO2 (OR,0.84; 95% CI,

 0.76–0.92); O3 (OR,0.85; 95% CI,0.74–0.97), PM10 (OR,0.80; 95% CI,0.70–0.92), and PM2.5 
(OR,0.79; 95% CI,0.69–0.91); with absolute decrease in prevalence of 1.8%, 1.7%, 2.2%, and 
2.3% respectively. The associations were similar or slightly stronger at age 15.
Conclusions and Relevance—Decreases in ambient pollution levels were associated with 
statistically significant decreases in bronchitic symptoms in children. While the study design does 
not establish causality, the findings support potential benefit of air pollution reduction on asthma 
control.
INTRODUCTION
Bronchitis and chronic bronchitic symptoms in children are common yet under-appreciated 
health issues associated with clinically important morbidity. [1–8] Several studies indicate 
that exposure to elevated concentrations of ambient air pollution, often at levels below 
regulatory standards, is associated with large increases in the prevalence of bronchitic 
symptoms among children with asthma, [1, 5, 9, 10] potentially resulting in a heavy burden 
of disease in exposed children with substantial economic cost.[11, 12]
Historically, Southern California has reported high levels of ambient air pollution due to 
emissions from vehicular traffic, industrial sources, two very large ports, and complex 
atmospheric photochemical reactions. In the last twenty years, significant improvements in 
air quality have been observed across Southern California due to a broad spectrum of air 
pollution reduction policies and strategies.[13] We hypothesized that the reductions in 
particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10) or less than 2.5 μm 
(PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Ozone (O3) concentrations observed across southern 
California were associated with improvements in respiratory symptoms in children with or 
without asthma. We examined data from the Southern California Children’s Health Study 
(CHS) that include twenty years of continuous air quality monitoring data and respiratory 
outcome information from successive cohorts of children followed during 1993–2012.
METHODS
Study Population
Twelve Southern California communities were originally selected to represent a historically 
diverse pollution profile of regional levels of NO2, PM10, O3 and acid vapor [14]. Three 
successively recruited cohorts were used in the current study. In 1993, 1,800 fourth graders, 
at ages 9–10, were recruited from schools across 12 communities and followed through high 
school graduation in 2001. In 1996, another cohort of approximately 2,080 fourth graders 
from the same communities was recruited and followed through high school graduation in 
2004. In 2003, a new cohort of 5,600 either kindergarten or first graders (aged 5–7) was 
recruited from thirteen Southern California communities. Eight communities (Alpine, Lake 
Elsinore, Long Beach, Mira Loma, Riverside, San Dimas, Santa Maria and Upland) had 
participants in all three cohorts (hereafter referred to as the 1993–2001, 1996–2004, and 
2003–2012 cohorts) with air pollution data collected with consistent methods over the period 
of study. Two other 1993–1995 and 1993–1998 CHS cohorts were not included in the 
current analysis because they had relatively shorter follow-up.[14, 15] All parents or

 guardians of participating children provided written informed consent. The study protocol 
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Southern California.
Data Collection
Bronchitic Outcomes and Asthma—Bronchitic symptoms were assessed using an 
annual follow-up questionnaire, as previously described.[1, 9] A child was considered to 
have had chronic bronchitic symptoms during the previous 12 months, based on the parent’s 
and/or child’s report of a daily cough for 3 months in a row, congestion or phlegm other than 
when accompanied by a cold, or bronchitis. For the 1993–2001 and 1996–2004 cohorts, 
children were considered to have a history of asthma before the age of 10 years, if there was 
a yes answer to the question on the baseline questionnaire “Has a doctor ever diagnosed this 
child as having asthma?” For the 2003–2012 Cohort, a child was considered to have a 
history of asthma before age 10 if an asthma diagnosis was made before age 10 based on 
annual assessment starting from age 5–7. In the models, participants were classified 
according to whether they had asthma before age 10 [asthma group] or did not have asthma 
before age 10 and during the follow-up period [non-asthma group].
Air Pollution Measurements and Metrics—Air pollution monitoring stations were 
established in each of the 8 communities. For each year of follow-up, measurements were 
made for O3, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5, as described previously, [14, 16] and in the online 
supplement (eMethods). Community-specific annual averages of the 24-hour PM10, PM2.5, 
and NO2 and of the 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. averages of O3 were used to compute the cohort-
specific mean levels for the relevant period of follow-up (9-yr 1992–2000 average; 9-year 
1995–2003 average; and 10-year 2002–2011 average for the three successive cohorts 
respectively) in each community. Exposure values were lagged by one year for better 
alignment with bronchitic outcomes data that assessed symptoms during the prior 12 
months.
Additional Covariates from Questionnaires—From the baseline and follow-up 
questionnaires, we evaluated potential confounders or modifiers of the associations with air 
pollution, including annual information on exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke in the 
home (SHS) and baseline information on the ownership of a dog, cat, or any pet (including 
dogs and cats), gender, race/ethnicity, and housing conditions. Race/ethnicity was based on 
self-identified information from questionnaire responses to investigator designed two fixed-
category questions on race and Hispanic ethnicity. The inclusion of race/ethnicity in the 
models was important in order to control for any confounding effect within and across the 
three cohorts.
Data Analysis
To assess the associations between improvements in air quality and bronchitic symptoms in 
children during 1993–2012, we used a multilevel logistic model [1, 9, 17] to examine the 
association between cohort- and community- specific pollution levels and longitudinal data 
on bronchitic symptoms. Random effects were included to account for serial dependency 
within children and clustering effects of children by cohort and community. Effect estimates 
were scaled to the corresponding median of the eight community-level average changes in

 each pollutant from the 1993–2001 to the 2003–2012 study periods. Time-dependent 
covariates included exposure to SHS, season/month of data collection and a cubic spline 
function of age with knots at 10 and 15 to account for any non-linear association of age with 
bronchitic symptoms. All results presented were obtained from asthma-specific models, 
which were fitted due to significant differences in prevalence of bronchitic symptoms by 
asthma status. Also, we examined potential effect modification by gender, race/ethnicity 
(limiting to Hispanic and non-Hispanic white groups), dog ownership, cat ownership, 
parental level of education, and exposure to SHS.[9] In all models, missing data were 
assumed to be missing at random. Because missingness in the adjustment variables was very 
modest, we used a missing indicator method as needed for any adjustment variable in order 
to avoid loss of sample size. [18] All of the final models were adjusted for age, gender, race/
ethnicity, and exposure to second hand smoke during the follow-up period. In addition, the 
models for NO2 were also adjusted for exposure to roaches at home. These models also 
included a fixed effect for community, and hence were used to make inferences on 
associations with community-specific secular changes in air pollution levels during the 
1992–2011 periods. Two pollutant models were fitted whenever the correlations between 
covariates were found to be sufficiently low in order to avoid multi-collinearity. Robustness 
of main study findings were tested via sensitivity analyses by limiting the analysis (i) to 
those participants without SHS or in-utero tobacco smoke exposure, (ii) to those with pets, 
(iii) to those stratified by obesity status (i.e., limiting to Non-obese participants and to 
normal-weight participants based on age- and sex- specific <95th and <85th cutoffs 
respectively based on CDC percentiles[19]), (iv) to those filling English language 
questionnaire only, (v) to those stratified by ethnicity (limiting to Hispanic whites only or to 
non-Hispanic whites only), (vi) to those with parents completing English language 
questionnaire only, (vii) to those participants without any asthma medication use, or (viii) to 
those participants with complete data during follow-up. Additional sensitivity analyses were 
conducted stratified by cat ownership, or parental level of education. Post-hoc sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to check if areas with increased concentrations of regulated 
regional air pollution levels generally had increased prevalence of bronchitis within any 
given cohort. Graphical displays of unprocessed data were also examined to assess if the 
main findings were supported by general patterns in the data.
All analyses assumed a two-sided alternative hypothesis at 0.05 level of significance. All 
models were fitted using the R (version i386 3.0.2) or SAS (SAS 9.3) software packages.
RESULTS
The study included 4,602 participants (1,008, 1,067, and 2,527 children from the 1993–
2001, 1996–2004, and 2003–2012 cohorts respectively) who had data from two or more 
annual follow-up questionnaires and after excluding 297 participants who were newly 
diagnosed with asthma during the follow-up period. There were similar numbers of girls and 
boys overall (49% vs. 51%) and across all cohorts (Table 1). The proportion of Hispanic 
children increased from 29% for the 1993–2001 cohort to 35% for the 1996–2004 cohort 
and to 56% for the 2003–2012 cohort. The 2003–2012 cohort had significantly lower 
proportion of exposure to SHS or history of in-utero exposure to maternal smoking and 
lower prevalence of ownership of any pets including cats and dogs as well as higher

 prevalence of asthma at age 10 (23% vs. 15%). Additionally, the 2003–2012 cohort had 
larger proportions of children with health insurance, living in homes with gas stoves, and 
who were obese or overweight at age 10 as well as lower proportion of children who had 
carpet in the house and who had parents with a high school diploma. A higher proportion of 
the 2003–2012 cohort participants completed a Spanish language questionnaire. Prevalence 
of bronchitic symptoms decreased across the 1993–2012 study period, but the reduction was 
larger between the 1996–2004 and the 2003–2012 cohorts compared to that between the two 
earlier cohorts which showed modest change or even slight increase at times. Levels were 
slightly higher at age 15 compared to age 10 within each cohort. Children with asthma had a 
significantly higher overall prevalence of bronchitic symptoms (Table 1, eTable 1 and 
eFigure 1).[20]
Overall, air pollution levels declined (especially after 2001) across the three cohorts as can 
be seen in Figure 1.[21] For NO2 and O3, pollution levels in all eight communities declined 
with the lowest average levels observed for the 2003–2012 cohort, with the exception of 
Long Beach and Santa Maria where O3 levels were higher in the 2003–2012 cohort (eTable 
2 and eFigure 2). The decreases were larger in communities with the highest levels of 
pollutants. Similar declines were observed for PM2.5, with the exception of Alpine. Changes 
in levels of PM10 were relatively smaller in most communities with modestly increased 
levels in some communities (eTable 2 and eFigure 2).
Decreases in ambient air pollutant levels of NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5 were associated with 
reductions in bronchitic symptoms at ages 10 and 15 with and without asthma (Table 2). 
Among children with asthma, bronchitic symptoms at age 10 were significantly associated 
with NO2 (odds ratio [OR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67–0.94) for a median reduction of 4.9 ppb with 
corresponding absolute decrease in prevalence of 10.1% (95% CI, 15.8-2.9). For O3, the OR 
was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.50–0.86) for a median reduction of 3.6 ppb with corresponding 
absolute decrease in prevalence of 16.3% (95% CI, 24.0-6.7). For PM10, the OR was 0.61 
(95% CI, 0.48–0.78) for a median reduction of 5.8 μg/m3 with corresponding absolute 
decrease in prevalence of 18.7% (95% CI, 25.0-10.6). For PM2.5, the OR was 0.68 (95% CI, 
0.53–0.86) for a median reduction of 6.8 μg/m3 with corresponding absolute decrease in 
prevalence of 15.4% (95% CI, 22.6–6.7). In the above calculations, the median reductions 
were based on the eight community-level changes in mean pollution levels during the 1992–
2000, 1995–2003 and the 2002–2011 averaging periods for the three cohorts. The absolute 
differences in prevalence were calculated relative to the adjusted baseline prevalence of 48% 
for the 1993–2001 cohort. Among children without asthma, the corresponding associations 
with prevalence of bronchitic symptoms were relatively smaller: NO2 (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 
0.76–0.92) with corresponding absolute decrease in prevalence of 1.8% (95% CI, 2.7-0.9), 
O3 (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74–0.97) with corresponding absolute decrease in prevalence of 
1.7% (95% CI, 2.9-0.3), PM10 (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70–0.92) with corresponding absolute 
decrease in prevalence of 2.2% (95% CI, 3.3-0.9), and PM2.5 (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69–
0.91) with corresponding absolute decrease in prevalence of 2.3% (95% CI, 3.4-1.0) (Table 
2). The absolute differences in prevalence were calculated relative to adjusted baseline 
prevalence of 11.1% for the 1993–2001 cohort. Corresponding results at age 15 were either 
similar or slightly larger (Table 2). In post hoc analyses, areas with increased concentrations 
of regulated regional air pollution levels generally had increased prevalence of bronchitis

 within any given cohort (eFigure 3). Similar associations were seen in graphs of unprocessed 
data, focusing on prevalences at age 10 (eFigure 4). Due to high multi-collinearity between 
NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 (see eTable 3), two-pollutant models were only possible with O3. 
Based on these two-pollutant models, the associations with O3 became non-significant 
(except for the O3 + NO2 model in the asthma group) while the estimates for each of the 
other pollutants remained significant (see eTable 4).
Based on models with random effects for the air pollution estimates, there was no 
heterogeneity of model estimates by community of residence. Plots of the predicted changes 
in prevalence of bronchitic symptoms by changes in air pollution levels across the study 
period showed that relatively larger changes in prevalence of bronchitic symptoms were 
observed in communities with larger changes in air pollutant levels (Figure 2), indicating 
that decreases in symptoms were not an artifact of temporal confounding acting across 
communities. For example, in the asthma group, a 12 μg/m2 decline in PM2.5 for children in 
Riverside was associated with a 20% reduction in bronchitic symptom prevalence while in 
Alpine, a decline of 0.5 μg/m2 was associated with a negligible change in the prevalence of 
bronchitic symptoms.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of study findings by limiting the 
analysis to important subgroups (see eMethods). The estimated reductions in bronchitic 
symptoms were robust to any of these restrictions (see eTable 5) and remained similar when 
examined at ages 10, 13 and 15 (Table 2 and eTable 6). Results from models limited to data 
with overlapping ages for all three cohorts (i.e., between ages of 10 and 15 years) were 
similar to those based on the whole age range (Table 2 and eTable 7). The results presented 
in eTable 7 were based on exposure averaging periods that were relevant to the overlapping 
age periods. Specifically, we used 1992–1997, 1995–2000, and 2006–2011 respectively for 
the three successive cohorts.
In the asthma group, the associations with NO2 and PM2.5 were significantly larger in boys 
and among children with family dog ownership (Table 3). Reductions in bronchitic 
symptoms as a function of improvement in air quality were qualitatively similar for ages 10 
and 15, or slightly larger for age 15 in some cases. None of the other interaction tests by 
parental level of education, race/ethnicity, cat ownership, or exposure to SHS were found to 
be statistically significant. Models that tested for effect modification by cat or dog ownership 
used data from 4,523 children, due to missing relevant questionnaire data.
DISCUSSION
The findings from this study demonstrate that reductions in levels of ambient air pollution 
over the past 20 years in Southern California were associated with significant reductions in 
bronchitic symptoms in children with and without asthma. The reductions were 
proportionally larger in children with asthma and remained similar when examined at 10, 13 
and 15 years of age during the follow-up period (Table 2 and eTable 6). Among asthmatics, 
the reductions in bronchitic symptoms tended to be larger in boys and those from households 
with dogs.[9]

 The reductions in bronchitic symptoms were larger in communities that showed higher 
improvements in air quality levels (Figure 2) indicating that the findings were robust to 
temporal confounding.[22] The findings remained robust during subgroup analysis by 
several factors that could contribute to differential biases and/or potential over- or under- 
estimation of study findings (eTable 5). Any temporal trends in asthma diagnosis, 
prevalence, severity or medication use are unlikely to account for these findings as our 
models also included spline terms for age to account for any secular trends in bronchitic 
symptoms. The linear relationship between change in air quality and changes in prevalence 
across all communities is consistent with an effect of air pollution reduction and also 
suggests that the results are not explained by a secular temporal trend (Figure 2).
Our results are consistent with findings from a large multi-community Swiss study of 9,591 
children which showed that moderate improvements in air quality were associated with 
significant reductions in respiratory symptoms, based on cross-sectional health assessments 
between 1992 and 2001.[23] Several studies have shown that areas with increased 
concentrations of regulated regional air pollution levels have increased prevalence of 
bronchitis [4, 7, 24], a finding that has also been confirmed in this study (eFigure 3). Some 
studies have shown that yearly variations in pollutant concentrations are positively 
associated with bronchitis prevalence, especially among children with asthma [1, 9]. Few 
previous studies have evaluated whether trends in reductions in air pollution levels over 
decades have led to reductions in bronchitic symptoms. Results from two repeated surveys in 
former East Germany showed that within-community reductions in total suspended 
particulates and SO2 levels following reunification were associated with substantial 
reductions in total bronchitis prevalence and other nonallergic respiratory symptoms. [25, 
26] It is possible that confounding by other temporal community characteristics or trends in 
respiratory outcomes across cohorts could explain these results. However, the consistency of 
associations in diverse populations and study designs, and biological patterns of 
susceptibility observed in studies of air pollution and bronchitis, suggest that the 
associations and the benefits observed in our study are causally related to air pollution 
reductions. Larger reductions in prevalence of bronchitic symptoms in children with asthma 
and with dogs as pets have been observed in previous analyses of the within-cohort 
variability in pollution concentrations across years in the CHS [1, 9]. These differences were 
predicted based on the known susceptibility of children with asthma to the pollutants studied 
and the higher levels of endotoxin, which has been shown to potentiate pollutant exposures, 
in the homes of children with dogs.
Our study has several strengths, including the prospective study design enabling evaluation 
of associations related to temporal trends in air pollution across several large ethnically 
diverse cohorts of children from the same communities on trends in bronchitic symptoms, 
substantial range in exposures to the spectrum of complex multi-pollutant mixtures available 
in Southern California representing the full national range in the United States, and the 
opportunity to test whether the associations varied by patterns in susceptibility factors. A 
major strength of the study was the consistency of protocols in collecting bronchitic 
symptoms, covariate information, and air pollution monitoring throughout the long study 
period.

 The findings should also be interpreted in light of some limitations. The outcome measure is 
based on relatively imprecise assessment of health outcomes defined using questionnaire-
based reporting of symptoms. However, these outcomes have been widely used in previous 
epidemiological studies and have shown robust associations with regional pollutants. [1, 4, 
7, 9, 24, 25] The components of the bronchitic symptom outcomes used in this study are 
suggestive of chronic, indolent symptoms that may follow an illness, acute exacerbation of 
asthma or chronic inflammation which would likely be remembered well. Questionnaire 
based report of respiratory symptoms might also reflect repeated acute exacerbation, but 
acute bronchitis has been reported to have a marked influence on quality of life, in adults 
and in children, and to persist for several weeks, so such episodes also would be likely to be 
remembered well. [11, 27]
It is possible that false positive misclassification of asthma might have resulted in an under-
estimation of the true effect of air pollution in children with asthma, given that asthmatic 
children were more sensitive than non-asthmatics. The misclassification of personal 
exposure based on community monitors may also have resulted in some under-estimation of 
the magnitude of associations. However, because concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 vary 
gradually with geographic distance in Southern California, exposure misclassification for 
children who attend school in their communities is unlikely to produce a large attenuation of 
associations. Ozone showed limited gradient across our communities, but has large indoor 
outdoor concentration differences that depend on housing characteristics and operation. The 
resulting exposure misclassification would likely result in artificially low model estimates 
for ozone. Reporting bias is an unlikely explanation for the observed within–community 
between-cohorts associations because any awareness of long-term trends in air pollution 
within any community is unlikely to have been a determinant of reporting of bronchitis. The 
shift in ethnic composition across the three cohorts towards more Hispanicity and lower SES 
is a potential source of bias. However, bias in our estimates from this change in ethnic 
distribution is not likely to have a major impact as sensitivity analyses based on models that 
only considered Hispanic children gave results that were similar to those that included all 
children. Our findings should be interpreted in the context of the observational design of the 
study and limitations associated with the use of ecologic community-level ambient (and 
personal level) exposure estimates in investigating the statistical associations. However, our 
study design with individual level longitudinal data on bronchitic outcomes and adjustment 
factors may help to reduce some of the limitations that occur in studies with purely ecologic 
design, such as aggregation bias, ecologic bias or both.[17, 28]
CONCLUSIONS
Decreases in ambient concentrations of NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 were associated with 
statistically significant decreases in bronchitic symptoms in children with and without 
asthma. While the study design does not establish causality, the findings support potential 
benefit of air pollution reduction on asthma control.

 Figure 1. Annual mean air pollutant levels during the follow-up period of the CHS study (1994–
2011) by communitya
a. Plots depict data for 1994–2011, even though the models use 1992–2011 exposure data to 
examine associations with 1993–2012 data on bronchitic symptoms. This is because data for 
1992 and 1993 were not complete and had to be substituted with 1994 data in some cases. 
For PM10 mean pollutant concentrations from 1994 were used for Alpine, Riverside and 
Upland for 1992 and 1993 due to missing data. Similarly, PM2.5 mean pollutant 
concentrations from 1994 were used for 1992 and 1993, for all eight communities, due to 
missing data.

aOdds Ratios (ORs) are per median decreases in pollution levels based on the eight community-level average changes during the period between the 1993-2001 and the 2003-2012 cohorts (4.9, and 3.6 ppb for NO2, O3, and 5.8 and 6.8 μg/m3 for PM10, and PM2.5, respectively). 
95% CI entries refer to 95% Confidence Intervals.
bOdds Ratio (OR), by asthma status, adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, longitudinal exposure to second hand tobacco smoke, and roaches at baseline.
cOdds Ratio (OR), by asthma status, adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity and longitudinal exposure to second hand tobacco smoke.
dThe absolute differences in prevalence were calculated relative to the adjusted baseline prevalence for the 1993-2001 cohort (48% for the asthma group and 11.1% for the non-asthma group).

aOdds Ratios (ORs) are per median decreases in pollution levels based on the eight community-level average changes during the period between the 1993–2001 and the 2003-2012 cohorts (4.9, and 3.6 ppb 
for NO2, O3, and 5.8 and 6.8 μg/m3 for PM10, and PM2.5, respectively). 95% CI entries refer to 95% Confidence Intervals.
bOdds Ratio (OR) adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, longitudinal second hand smoke, and roaches at baseline.
cOdds Ratio (OR) adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity and longitudinal second hand smoke.
dp-values for tests of interaction effects between air pollutants and effect modifiers
