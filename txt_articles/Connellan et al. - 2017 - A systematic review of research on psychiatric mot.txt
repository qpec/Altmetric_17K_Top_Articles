Abstract 
Purpose: Psychiatric Mother-Baby Units (MBUs) are currently viewed as best practice, particularly in the 
United Kingdom, Australia, and France, for improving outcomes for mothers and babies when the former are 
experiencing severe forms of mental illness. A growing number of publications have examined MBUs, but to 
date there has not been a comprehensive review of these studies. As such, the systematic review reported in this 
paper sought to address this gap. Methods: A systematic search was conducted for peer-reviewed research and 
grey literature published in English between 2000 and 2015. A final sample of 44 publications were identified 
that reported on empirical findings with regard to MBUs. Three quarters of the studies focused on individual 
MBUs and most studies were quantitative. Results: A thematic analysis of the studies identified three major 
themes: (1) admissions data, (2) outcomes for mothers, and (3) programs and interventions. The analysis also 
identified four secondary themes: (i) follow up after discharge; (ii) separation of mothers and babies after 
discharge; (iii) client satisfaction with MBUs; and (iv) partners of women admitted to MBUs. Conclusions: The 
findings of the review highlight gaps in knowledge about MBUs and provide suggestions for future research.

Introduction 
During the first half of the twentieth century, the separation of mothers and their babies was viewed as best 
practice when mothers were experiencing severe forms of mental illness and required psychiatric treatment. 
Howard (2000) notes that mothers tended to be admitted to institutions or asylums, particularly at the height of 
their usage in the early decades of the twentieth century. The practice of separating mothers and babies began to 
change, however, during the 1950s and 1960s, when research findings indicated that keeping mothers and 
babies together was best for establishing a secure mother-child relationship (Howard, 2000). This led to the 
creation of mother-baby units (MBUs), which appeared in some form in the late 1950s and early 1960s in the 
United Kingdom (UK) (Baker, Morison, Game, and Thorpe 1961).  The first MBU in France was opened in 
1979 in Créteil followed by three more in France in the 1980s (Cazas and Glangeaud-Freudenthal 2004), though 
joint mother-baby inpatient admissions occurred as early as 1960 (Baker et al., 1961).  The 1980s saw the 
  
 
establishment of MBUs in Melbourne, Australia and the first MBU in Belgium opened in 1985 in Zoersel 
(Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al. 2014).  
 
MBUs appeared in the context of a range of social changes and research advances, including new 
understandings concerning the importance of the mother-baby relationship and attachment (e.g. Bowlby 1969), 
advances in relevant psychiatric treatments, the changing nature of asylums (directed by government policy), 
changing family structures (meaning that other carers were often not available), the development of social 
psychiatry, and the increase in the number of psychiatrists who were women (Cazas and Glangeaud-Freudenthal 
2004; Howard 2000). Psychiatric mother and baby units (MBUs) are now viewed as the best setting for mothers 
with severe mental illness, given co-admission potentially reduces interruptions to attachment relationships (e.g. 
Cazas and Glangeaud-Freudenthal 2004; Green, Hofberg, Carr, Fanneran and Sumathipala 2016; National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014).  
 
While MBUs are now established best practice in many countries, there is no accepted definition of how a MBU 
should be structured or run (Elkin et al. 2009). Generally, psychiatric MBUs refer to separate wards or buildings 
dedicated to housing mothers and their babies full-time, with at least four beds and cots or bassinettes (Elkin et 
al. 2009; Glangeaud-Freudenthal, Howard, and Sutter-Dallay 2014). MBUs are usually staffed by 
multidisciplinary teams whose role it is to care for mothers and babies, with expertise focused on the treatment 
of mothers’ mental health conditions, building attachment relationships and positive interactions between 
mothers and babies, and assisting mothers to gain skills in child care and development (Glangeaud-Freudenthal 
et al. 2014). 
 
MBUs are currently most common in the UK, Australia, and France, where they have been actively promoted 
for several years. MBUs also exist in other European countries including Belgium (e.g. Glangeaud-Freudenthal 
and The MBU-SMF Working Group 2004),  the Netherlands (Noorlander, Bergink, and van den Berg 2008), 
Hungary (Glangeaud-Freudenthal, Howard, and Sutter-Dallay 2014), and Germany (Grube 2005), and outside 
Europe in the United States (US) (Meltzer-Brody et al. 2014), Israel (Maizel, Katzenelson, and Fainstein 2005), 
India (Chandra, Desai, Reddy, Thippeswamy, and Saraf 2015), and Sri Lanka (Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al. 
2014). The countries that have  most actively promoted specialised inpatient MBUs include the UK, Australia, 
France, and Belgium, which is reflected by the higher number of MBUs in those countries. Although not 
included in this review, it is also worth noting that 24 of the 26 cantons (92%) in Switzerland offer joint mother-
  
 
baby admissions in general psychiatric wards, and since 2007 three cantons offer specialised inpatient perinatal-
psychiatric care with 3-8 beds in each (Castro et al. 2015). Practices and admissions differ between (and within) 
countries, however, due to different mental health and perinatal care systems within each country, and the fact 
that they may cater for clients presenting with different mental health issues (Glangeaud-Freudenthal and The 
MBU-SMF Working Group 2004). The existence of individual MBUs can be tenuous, and numbers have 
fluctuated due to a range of factors including funding, the interest of doctors (who are largely responsible for 
keeping the units in existence), the children’s status as patients or not, and the size of the unit (Cazas and 
Glangeaud-Freudenthal 2004). 
 
Although at least two previous literature reviews have focused on psychiatric MBUs, these have specifically 
focused solely on mental health outcomes for women following admission (Gillham and Wittkowski 2015) and 
parenting capacity (Hammond and Lipsedge 2015). In addition, a review examining MBU care for mothers with 
schizophrenia or psychoses undertaken in the UK in 2006 (Irving and Saylan 2007) could find no studies that 
included randomised controlled trials and no studies with substantive evidence in the Cochrane Schizophrenia 
Group Trial Register. As a result, these authors highlight the urgent need for reliable evidenced based studies on 
MBU efficacy. The aim of the present systematic review is to provide an overall picture of empirical research 
which has been conducted in and about MBUs around the world. After outlining the systematic approach to 
undertaking the review, this article then reports on a thematic analysis of the studies identified in order to 
provide a picture of the key areas of current attention within research on MBUs.  
 
Methods 
 
Search strategy and inclusion criteria 
Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed empirical studies or grey literature that focused on psychiatric mother-
baby units published in English in the last 15 full calendar years (i.e. 1 January 2000-31 December 2015).  A 
systematic search of seven databases was conducted: PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, Sociological Abstracts, Web 
of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and Google Scholar. Search terms used were "mother 
and baby unit*" OR "mother-baby unit*" OR "mother-infant unit*" OR "mother baby inpatient*" or "mother-
baby psychiat*" OR "postpartum psychos*". These searches resulted in a total of 1,321 records - of which 487 
were duplicates – leaving a total of 834 articles considered for inclusion (see Figure 1).  
 
  
 
The second author conducted the search and reviewed all 834 article titles and abstracts. As can be seen in 
Figure 1, this initial process resulted in the exclusion of 757 articles. These studies were excluded because they 
were individual or small case studies, did not include empirical or primary data, or did not focus on psychiatric 
MBUs (e.g., focused instead on general settings, or settings such as prisons). Studies were also excluded if they 
included participants from MBUs but focused on separate research questions (e.g., were designed to develop a 
new psychiatric scale; e.g. Cunningham, Brown, and Page 2015), or if more than one kind of setting was 
included and the findings were not distinct. When a peer-reviewed journal article was published from a thesis 
and the two reported on the same research, the article but not the thesis was included (e.g. Butler, Hare, Walker, 
Wieck and Wittkowski 2014). When a thesis or section of a thesis had not been published then the original 
thesis was included (e.g. the section on staff in Butler 2013). Finally, articles which were in-press in 2016 were 
excluded as full texts could not be obtained for these papers. 
 
Where it was unclear from the abstract whether or not an article met the inclusion criteria, the full-text was 
sought and reviewed against the inclusion criteria. If uncertainty remained, the third author also reviewed the 
abstract and full-text, and consensus was reached. As can be seen in Figure 1, studies were included if they were 
empirical studies or included primary data from psychiatric MBUs, and where the MBU was the focus of the 
study. Studies which were not empirical studies per se but reported on data about MBUs (such as client 
outcomes after admissions) were also included as they provide considerable information about the context of 
MBUs, particularly in terms of admissions. 37 publications were excluded after examining full-texts. An 
additional four sources were found at this point from an examination of reference lists of the articles remaining 
in the sample at this point.  
 
Applying these inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in a final sample of 44 publications with consensus 
from the second and third authors (see Figure 1). The 44 sources identified consisted of 41 refereed journal 
articles and three theses (Butler 2013; Kemp 2011; Masciantonio 2015). Articles were published in 22 different 
journals, with the largest number appearing in the Archives of Women’s Mental Health (n = 13).

Method of analysis 
Since the final sample of articles  include a mixture of research designs across a range of research questions 
associated with MBUs, it was not appropriate to conduct a meta-analysis. Instead, the method of data synthesis 
for this review was informed by The Joanna Briggs Institute ‘aggregate mixed method synthesis’, which draws 
upon the Bayesian approach to translating quantitative data into qualitative (Joanna Briggs Institute 2014). This 
approach presents a simplified, ‘elegant and yet powerful method of combining data’ (p. 13), without distorting 
the findings of the individual studies.  
 
Three key themes predominated across the studies (1) admissions data (12 sources), (2) outcomes for mothers, 
using admissions and discharge data (10 sources) and (3) the impact of programs and interventions in MBUs (10 
sources). Four secondary themes were represented in the studies: (i) follow up after discharge (6 sources); (ii) 
separation of mothers and babies after discharge (5 sources); (iii) client satisfaction of MBU (3 sources); and 
(iv) partners of women admitted to MBUs (2 sources). Follow-up after discharge as a theme tended to overlap 
with the major focus of outcomes and also with the secondary theme of separation after discharge. The 
remaining papers did not fit into repeated themes, but instead focused on understanding the characteristics of the 
population admitted to MBUs.  
 
Results 
In terms of summarising the overall findings of previous research, Table 1 provides an overview of sources 
included in the review, summarising methods and focus for each article.  
 
[INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE] 
 
Of the 44 sources included in the final sample, 31 focused on individual MBUs. Of these 15 reported on studies 
conducted in the UK, 9 in Australia, and the remaining 7 were spread evenly across Belgium, France, Germany, 
India, Israel, the Netherlands, and the US. The dominant methodology used in the studies of individual units 
was quantitative, focusing primarily on admissions data and outcomes of mothers admitted to MBUs.  
 
The remainder of the sources focused on multiple MBUs, with Howard et al. (2004) focusing on 18 MBUs in 
the UK, Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al. (2013) focusing on 13 in France and 3 in Belgium, Glangeaud-
Freudenthal et al. (2011) and Sutter-Dallay et al. (2015) focusing on 13 in France, Elkin et al. (2009) focusing 
  
 
on 12 in England, Glangeaud-Freudenthal and The MBU-SMF Working Group (2004) focusing on 11 in France 
and Belgium, Salmon et al. (2003, 2004) and Abel et al. (2005) focusing on eight MBUs and three facilities in 
the UK, Buist et al. (2004) focusing on four in Australia, Vliegen et al. (2010; 2013) focusing on two in 
Belgium, and the remainder focusing on an unspecified multiple number in the UK (Howard, Shah, Salmon, and 
Appleby 2003) and Australia (Milgrom and Beatrice 2003). 
 
It was evident that the same datasets and/or MBUs were often focused on, and thus there is a degree of overlap 
in the studies outlined in this review. In terms of the same datasets, Salmon and colleagues draw on the same 
UK Marcé database information (Salmon et al. 2003; Salmon et al. 2004), and Howard and colleagues draw on a 
similar dataset to Salmon and colleagues but from slightly different Marcé entries (Howard et al. 2003; Howard 
et al. 2004). In France, Glangeaud-Freudenthal and colleagues draw on different samples but there was however 
some overlap of data from 13 French MBUs from the Marcé database, which was justified by the aims of the 
studies (Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al. 2013; Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al. 2011; Sutter-Dallay et al. 2015). The 
data published in 2013 was added to the data from France published in 2011 (2001-2007; n=814), and the data 
from Belgium for the same period (2001-2007; n=1018) to allow more diversity in child status to study 
separation status at discharge from MBUs. The data used in Sutter et al. (2015) includes the 2011 data from 
France, and added data collected in France for three additional years  to increase the sample size and statistical 
power for logistic regression on the impact of drug treatment upon the child (2001-2010; n=1071).  The UK 
Marcé checklist used for data collection in multiple MBU’s is also used in French studies to enable a 
collaborative comparison between the two countries. However the French version has more details on paternal 
disorders, drug treatments and past-history of both parents (Cazas et al. 2004). In terms of drawing on the same 
empirical study, Vliegen and colleagues use the same sample and similar instruments (Vliegen et al., 2010; 
Vliegen et al. 2013). 
 
When specific MBUs were named in the 44 publications, it was evident that there are multiple sources 
collecting data from the same places: Bethlem Royal Hospital in South London, UK (Kenny et al. 2013; Pawlby 
et al. 2010; Seneviratne et al. 2003), Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester, UK (Antonysamy, Wieck, and 
Wittkowski 2009; Neil, Sanderson, and Wieck 2006), Austin Hospital in Melbourne, Australia (Bilszta, Buist, 
Wang, and Zulkefli 2012; Nair, Bilszta, Salam et al. 2010; Nair, Bilszta, Shafira et al. 2010), Helen Mayo House 
in Adelaide, Australia (Connerty et al. 2015; Yelland et al. 2015); and unnamed MBUs in Belgium (Vliegen et 
al. 2010; Vliegen et al. 2013) and Manchester in the UK (Wan, Salmon et al. 2007; Wan, Warburton et al. 2007; 
  
 
Wan et al. 2008). Additional sources may have collected data from the same MBUs without naming them. This 
highlights that aside from the larger scale Marcé database information, studies focus on a small number of 
MBUs. 
 
The majority of sources used quantitative research designs including scales and/or surveys to collect data, either 
self-reported or completed by MBU staff. The most common instruments used were the Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale (7 studies) and the Marcé Clinical Checklist (6 studies). Clinical profiles and medical records 
were also used in some studies. Observations and video-taping was also used, particularly in analyses of 
programs and mother-infant attachment. Although rare, five studies were predominantly qualitative: Buultjens 
and Liamputtong (2007) and Connerty et al. (2015) on mothers; Kemp (2011), on fathers; and Masciantonio 
(2015) and Van Puyvelde et al. (2014) on mother-baby attachment. However methods that were arguably 
qualitative in parts (some in the analysis and some in the collection of data) were intermixed into six 
quantitative studies: Antonysamy et al. (2009) used semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions; 
Bilszta et al. (2012) used human-centred play therapy; Butler et al. (2014) used Q methods; Elkin et al. (2009) 
used multiple methods to identify services including consultations and personal telephone enquiries; Grube 
(2005) observed interactions in the ward; and Nair et al. (2010) in their client satisfaction survey, included open-
ended questions which were then analysed for themes. These inclusions indicate a tendency for a mixed 
methods approach to the study of MBUs. 
 
Key Theme 1: Admissions data from MBUs 
The first theme identified in the analysis of the 44 sources was that of a focus on admissions data. Table 2 
presents the admissions data for MBUs reported in the sources included in this theme, a major source of 
information for tracking outcomes. Thirteen sources provide detailed information about admissions to MBUs 
including number of joint admissions, maternal age, infant age, primary diagnosis, length of stay, and, in some 
cases, ethnic and/or socioeconomic backgrounds of mothers. 
 
[INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE] 
 
Maternal mean age ranged from 24.25 years (Chandra et al. 2015) to 33.5 years (Christl et al. 2015), and infant 
mean age at time of admission ranged from 9.6 weeks (Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al. 2013; Glangeaud-
Freudenthal et al. 2011) to 7.82 months (Yelland et al. 2015). Mean length of stay ranged from 6.93 days in a 
  
 
study in the US (Meltzer-Brody et al. 2014) to 11.6 weeks in a study in Israel (Maizel et al. 2005). These 
differences are likely to be, at least in part, due to the different nature and purpose of MBUs in different 
countries and regions. 
 
Primary diagnosis for mothers varied greatly between the MBUs, again, likely a reflection of the varying nature 
and purpose of MBUs. The most common diagnoses overall were depressive illnesses, schizophrenia, and 
differing forms of psychosis. 
 
Key Theme 2: Outcomes  
The second theme identified in the analysis was that of outcomes for mothers. Outcomes for mothers were the 
focus of ten studies on MBUs, as outlined in Table 3. Overall, these studies suggest that the mental health of 
mothers who are admitted to MBUs improves significantly by the time they are discharged. The largest study 
conducted on outcomes was undertaken by Salmon and colleagues (2003), who analysed the outcomes of 1,081 
women in eight mother-baby units in the UK, and found that 78% were symptom free or considerably improved 
in terms of maternal clinical outcome, and most scored at least 80% on three parenting outcomes. Women with 
schizophrenia, however, had poorer outcomes on all measures; but Abel et al. (2005) who used admissions data 
to relate predictors to outcomes found that protective factors such as social stability amongst women with 
schizophrenia enhances successful parenting in this group. 
 
[INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE] 
 
Similarly, Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al.(2011) in their analysis of 869 women in 13 mother-baby units in France 
found that two thirds (69%) of the women were symptom-free or considerably improved by the time they were 
discharged, with this being higher for those with issues appearing (or reappearing) in the postpartum period 
compared to those with chronic mental illness. Whilst most of the studies in this theme of outcomes use 
quantitative methods to measure outcomes, they also acknowledge the need for more holistic approaches to the 
mother-infant relationship within the family and their broader social and economic milieu.  
 
Key Theme 3: Programs and interventions in MBUs 
This third theme included a strong focus on interventions that enable parenting skills and emotionally responsive 
mother-infant interactions. The sources included in this theme are outlined in Table 4, which also includes 
  
 
assessments of mother-infant relationships. In terms of specific findings, Butler et al. (2014) examined the views 
of mothers about a parenting program (the Baby Triple P Positive Parenting Programme) run in one UK MBU. 
The mothers viewed the program as beneficial, and the MBU as a good setting to engage in the program, 
although it was noted that a commitment to the programme may be difficult for mothers who are recovering 
from mental health issues, and that mothers said MBU staff needed to be familiar with the programme. Butler 
(2013) also examined the views of staff of a MBU about the same parenting program, finding that they too 
viewed the program as a positive intervention and the MBU as a useful setting for it. 
 
[INSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE] 
 
Bilszta et al. (2012) examined the potential usefulness of video-only feedback or verbal-only feedback 
interventions in comparison to standard care to improve maternal parenting amongst women in an Australian 
MBU. They found that the interventions were not clearly better than standard care (which already include music 
and art therapy interventions). A video feedback intervention was also used by Kenny et al. (2013) in the UK to 
examine possibilities for improving mother-infant interaction. They found that there were improved interactions 
regardless of the diagnoses (including schizophrenia) of the mothers. In Belgium, Van Puyvelde et al. (2014) 
examined the potential for mother-infant group therapy using music to establish maternal-infant 
intersubjectivity. They found that maternal-infant intersubjectivity increased from Session 1 to Session 5, 
although their findings are based on a small sample. 
 
Secondary theme i: Follow-up after discharge from MBU 
Six papers explicitly focused on follow-up and outcomes following discharge from an MBU. A three and a half 
year follow-up study in Belgium found that 61% of mothers were functioning ‘relatively well’, but 39% 
continued to be impacted by severe depression (Vliegen et al. 2013; Vliegen et al. 2010). In the UK, Hipwell et 
al.’s (2000) follow-up study of 82 mother-infant dyads over the child’s first year of life found that mother-infant 
interactions were still impacted negatively by the mother’s illness. Also in the UK, a follow-up study of children 
aged 4-6 of mothers who had previously been inpatients in an MBU currently living with their mother were not 
found to have poorer developmental outcomes with comparison children or standardised child norms, although 
some had issues with attachment (Wan, Warburton et al. 2007).  
 
  
 
One of the few qualitative studies about MBUs examines eight women’s lived experiences following discharge 
from an MBU in Australia (Connerty et al. 2015). This study is important as it provides information to assist in 
understanding outcomes reported in quantitative studies. The study found that the women experienced returning 
home from the MBU as a significant life event, and that women did not feel they had clear enough support plans 
post-discharge. Meltzer-Brody et al. 2014 note that additional studies need to address the transition from 
inpatient to community care.  Howard et al. (2003) use data from 1,255 mothers on the Marcé data base in 2001 
to ascertain levels of continued social service supervision after discharge, noting that mothers with 
schizophrenia show a high risk of supervision and recommending that the whole family context should be 
treated.  
 
Secondary theme ii: Separation of mothers and children at discharge from MBU 
Five papers examined the separation of mothers and children at discharge from an MBU. Two large studies of 
over 1,000 mother/child pairings have been conducted (Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al. 2013; Howard et al. 2003), 
as well as a number of smaller studies. Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al.’s (2013) prospective longitudinal study of 
1,018 women in France and Belgium found that most children were discharged with their mothers, but that 151 
(14.8%) were separated at discharge. Of those separated, 41% of children were placed in foster families, 41% in 
institutions, 13% with family members (3% with fathers), and 1% stayed at the MBU for more than a month 
after the mother was discharged. Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al. (2013) argue that there were a number of risk 
factors for separation: babies with medical complications, type of psychiatric disorder for mothers, type of 
psychiatric disorder for fathers, mothers’ lack of good social relationships with others, mothers receiving 
disability benefits, and low socio-economic class. The importance of large sample sizes using regression 
analysis of statistically independent risk factors such as neo-natal medical complications, maternal and paternal 
psychiatric disorders, maternal relationships with others, maternal disability benefits, and social class, is evident 
in Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al. (2013); and these authors argue that the larger sample results confirm studies 
that use univariate analysis of small samples.  Additionally, Glandeaud-Freudenthal et al.’s study highlights the 
connection between the child’s vulnerability and the existence of the above listed factors such as maternal and 
paternal mental health and psychosocial contexts.  
 
Howard and colleague’s (2003) analysis of the data of mothers entered on the Marce database in the UK 
identified data relating to discharge for 1,197 women. In terms of discharges, 77% (921) of babies were 
discharged with their mother without formal supervision. Of the 23% discharged with their babies under a form 
  
 
of social services supervision or without their babies, 6% (75) were discharged with mothers placed on an ‘at 
risk’ register, 7% (81) were discharged with mothers under a protection or care order, 6% (69) were placed in 
voluntary foster care, and 4% (51) were placed in statutory care or adopted. There was an increased risk of 
supervision for mothers with schizophrenia and personality disorder, as well as in relation to social class, single 
marital status, behavioural disturbance, and psychiatric illness in partner. Smaller studies have also found that 
the type of mental health diagnosis is a key factor in separation at discharge (e.g. Poinso et al. 2002; Seneviratne 
et al. 2003). 
 
Secondary theme iii: Client satisfaction with MBUs 
Three studies examining client satisfaction with MBUs found experiences to be generally positive overall, 
including the finding that MBUs are preferable to general psychiatric wards. However, existing studies have 
small sample sizes (less than 60 participants). Neil et al. (2006) developed the Mother and Baby Unit 
Satisfaction Questionnaire, but note that it is limited because service users were not formally consulted in its 
development. Their study in the UK of 20 women found overall satisfaction to be high, and that the MBU was 
preferred over a general psychiatric ward. Women were most satisfied with baby equipment (very satisfied – 
85%), visitor arrangements for partners/relatives (63.2%), partner involvement with baby (63.2%), appearance 
of the ward (65.0%), privacy (60%), and waiting times (57.9%). Women were least satisfied with involvement 
in their own care (very or quite dissatisfied – 50%) and organised activities (47.4%).  
 
A modified version of the Mother and Baby Unit Satisfaction Questionnaire was used by Antonysamy et al 
(2009), also in the UK. Their survey of 57 women found that 84.2% were satisfied overall with the MBU. Over 
90% were satisfied with baby care advice (96.4%), baby equipment (94.8%), and advice on child development 
(94.7%). Mothers were most dissatisfied with organised activities (33.4%) and food (17.6%). Interviews in the 
same study found that all women preferred the MBU to general psychiatric ward because they viewed it as more 
secure and thought it was important to be with their baby to help with recovery. Some mothers said they had 
insufficient access to doctors and nursing staff, and that there was a lack of organised ward activities.  
 
Similar findings are evident from Nair et al.’s (2010) telephone survey of 37 women in Australia who had 
previously been admitted to a MBU. 60% of women said admission to the MBU was ‘very’ or ‘quite’ useful, 
but noted that areas to improve included increased staff availability (27%), staff behaviour (22%), and increased 
practical support availability (19%). 
  
 
 
Secondary theme iv: Partners of women admitted to MBUs 
Only two studies focused on male partners of women admitted to MBUs, although this topic is included in five 
additional papers (Bosanac et al. 2004; Gillham and Wittkowski 2015; Glangeaud-Freudenthal et al. 2013 and 
2011; Poinso et al. 2002). Of the two studies where partners were a primary focus, Grube’s (2005) German 
study with 31 male partners of women admitted to MBUs found that only a third of partners could be described 
as ‘supportive’ (a ‘competent father’, ‘supportive partner’, and ‘having a symmetric relationship’), and that 
women with supportive male partners had a shorter stay in the MBU. Grube’s study also highlights the high rate 
of male partners with psychiatric disorders.  
 
Kemp’s (2011) qualitative interview study with six fathers in the UK found that fathers tried to make sense of 
what had happened to their partner, felt limited in being able to help, faced competing physical and emotional 
demands of partner, child, and self, had their role and identity challenged by the MBU, and viewed that 
treatment should be family focused (including fathers). 
 
Concluding discussion 
This systematic review indicates that on the whole the MBU setting is a favourable environment for 
interventions and programs which lead to positive outcomes for post-partum mothers who fit the criteria for 
admission to a psychiatric MBU. However, to continue to warrant the role of the MBU as best practice for 
perinatal and postnatal care, researchers need to be more specific about the institutional and legislative contexts 
of studies. Additionally, more comparative studies need to be conducted on MBUs in and within different 
countries. For example, whilst this review indicates that whilst there are some similarities between the UK, 
Australia and France (i.., the Marcé checklist is used in multiple MBUs in the UK and Frrance), the remaining 
studies have diverse approaches. Further studies between countries using comparative instruments and 
methodologies would be useful to facilitate results comparison. 
 
A limitation of this review in terms of providing an accurate international perspective is the exclusion of non-
English language publications, particularly the existing French and German studies that use both qualitative and 
quantitative methods to evaluate MBUs. To this end we recommend future reviews are authored by a multi-
lingual team of authors. Another limitation of our review is the timeframe of 2000 to 2015. We deemed it 
necessary to start our review in the year 2000 to provide a scope for the review (which was already significant), 
  
 
as well as to focus on the most recent literature on MBUs. However, we note that important studies were 
published prior to the year 2000 and provide a useful context to knowledge about the development and history 
of MBUs. Alongside the sources included in our introduction, we note in particular the important work of Buist 
et al. (1990), Klompenhouwer and van Hulst (1991), Kumar et al. (1995), Brockington (1996), and Milgrom et 
al. (1998).   
 
In terms of gaps in research, a notable absence in the sources identified was attention to the physical spaces of 
MBUs. Research that has focused on the health impacts of design clearly indicates that the built space shapes 
how clients experience mental health units more generally (Connellan et al., 2013). As such, it would seem 
important that into the future research is undertaken that focuses on the design, space, and architecture of 
MBUs, and especially how these can improve therapeutic outcomes.  
 
Another absence in current research is the financial cost of MBUs. There is no doubt that they are expensive to 
operate well, but only one source (Kenny et al. 2013) recommends an evaluation of cost effectiveness in MBUs. 
We also recommend evaluations on cost effectiveness but if, as the current studies acknowledge, MBUs are the 
ideal for treating mothers experiencing severe forms of mental illness who require psychiatric treatment, then 
cost appraisals must take place alongside evaluations of care and practices. There also is a need for evaluating 
the care and practices of MBUs with more follow-up studies on the impact of MBU care. For example, 
evaluation questions on why MBUs are considered ideal in terms of issues such as attachment, postpartum 
psychosis, learning parenting, and avoiding guilt of separation, amongst others. Consequently a case also needs 
to be made to fund research and specifically randomised control trials that address the cost effectiveness of this 
best practice.  
 
Methodologically the majority of studies exploring MBUs were quantitative in design, however there is a 
growing tendency to include qualitative approaches that provide a more contextualised picture of the experience 
of MBUs. More qualitative studies concerning the experiences of staff, mothers, partners and families/visitors in 
the MBU are also needed in order to provide important information concerning the broader contextual 
information that may influence outcomes for mothers and babies beyond the immediate clinical interventions 
that they receive.  
 
  
 
Of the studies included in this review, there is a concerted call for the inclusion of the family at all stages 
including discharge and follow-up. Studies in this review show differences in outcomes for mothers with 
depressive illnesses to those with psychosis or schizophrenia, however it is clear that larger samples and more 
longitudinal studies need to be conducted with a focus on the role of family members. 
 
In sum, this review indicates that much has been achieved by MBUs throughout the sixty years of their 
existence as a therapeutic entity. As is the case for any such entity, empirical evidence is vital to ensuring 
ongoing funding. Perhaps more importantly, however, empirical evidence has the potential to make a significant 
contribution to the types of services provided, and thus the outcomes for those whom such services target.

Key points and recommendations 
Abel et al. (2005) 
Quantitative 
Differences between mothers with schizophrenia and 
mothers with affective illnesses are not clear cut, good 
social interaction skills are a key contribution to attaining 
parenting skills; risk of physical harm to infants from 
mothers with schizophrenia is less than expected by 
clinicians; authors recommend ‘more sophisticated 
approaches to the assessment of mothers with 
schizophrenia’ (788.)  
Buultjens et al. 2007 
 
Australia 
Qualitative.  
Semi-structured 
interviews and 
thematic 
analysis 
Situating post-natal depression in feminist discourse. 
Considering societal expectations and stigmas relating to 
mother/parenthood. . 
Need for social support and a nurturing attitude towards 
mothers. 
Chandra et al. 2015 
 
India 
Quantitative 
admissions data  
Feasibility of clinical outcomes in an MBU in a ‘low 
resource setting’. 
Importance of joint care and interventions for mother-
infant dyads.  
 
Christl et al. 2015 
 
Australia 
Quantitative.  
 
 
Focus on mothers admitted to a private MBU with 
depression and anxiety. LOS and rates of improvement 
using a parenting scale, correlate with similar recent 
studies in the public system. Recommendation for 
observational methods using video feedback (not used in 
this study). 
Elkin et al. 2009 
 
England 
Quantitative 
but including 
qualitative 
service 
identification 
National survey of MBUs. 
Insufficient facilities in England. 
Organizational characteristics ‘highly variable’. 
 
Glangeaud-Fredenthal et al. 2004 
 
France and Belgium 
Quantitative 
National data collection. 
Separate attention to pathology because ‘outcome and 
context at discharge are different’ (p. 63) 
More than half of partners or fathers have mental health 
problems. 
Larger sample needed to establish ‘interaction between 
risk-factors’ (p. 63) 
Glangeaud-Fredenthal et al. 2011 
 
France 
 
Quantitative 
admissions data 
Comprehensive data on social demographics. 
Rates of improved outcomes high for depression and 
affective disorders but not schizophrenia. 
Significance of partner’s mental health for mother. 
 
Hipwell et al. 2000 
 
England 
 
Quantitative. 
 
 
Examination and comparison of the quality of mother-
infant interactions and nature of attachment at 12 
months.  Play observations.  2 case groups and 1 control 
group.  
Findings highlight ‘the importance of sample 
homogeneity’ regarding mother’s illness (p. 169).  
 
Milgrom and Beatrice, 2003 
 
Australia 
 
Quantitative 
Comparison of mature, neurotic and immature defence 
styles of depressed and non-depressed groups. 
In line with other studies and consistent with Beck’s 
model, cognitive styles of depressed mothers show 
symptoms that are ‘depressogenic’ and at risk of using 
habitual defence styles.  
Salmon et al.2003 
 
United Kingdom 
Quantitative 
Largest reported sample of joint mother baby psychiatric 
admissions. 
Partner’s lack of parenting skills a contributing factor. 
  
Poorer outcomes for mothers with schizophrenia. 
Salmon et al. 2004 
 
United Kingdom 
 
Quantitative 
Use of the same data in 2003 paper’s national audit.  
Authors acknowledge that it is not a RCT. 
Vulnerabilities of ‘poor social class’ and lack of social 
support influence positive outcomes.  
Emphasis of high risk of harm in mothers with 
schizophrenia.

Importance of flexible interventions that cater to 
different needs of mothers. 
No marked difference between mothers who participated 
in the videoed intervention strategy and those who did 
not.

Video feedback data showed that ‘mothers with 
schizophrenia improved their interactive skills with 
infants as much as mothers with other mental diagnoses’. 
Masciantonio et al. 2015

Use of psychotherapeutic attachment theory tool COS 
(Circle of Security). 
Noorlander et al. 2008

Challenging assumptions that mothers with SMI have 
lower rates of interaction with their infants. Results 
differ from Wan et al. 2007 and 2008 findings of deficits 
in maternal responsiveness for schizophrenia diagnoses.  
Importance of gaining knowledge of normative levels of 
interactional behaviour. 
Mind-Mindedness approach to videotaped play 
observations of three clinical groups with one healthy 
mother-infant dyad group. ANCOVA (Analysis of co-
variance) coding.

establish patterns or interaction. 
Behaviour and response identified and coded.  
Mothers with schizophrenia showed a low level of 
responsiveness compared with mothers with affective 
disorders. 
 
Wan et al. 2007b 
Quantitative 
 Mother infant dyads videoed a week before discharge 
over a 6 year period. Focus on maternal responsiveness 
of mothers with schizophrenia. Findings show infants of 
mothers with schizophrenia are ‘significantly more 
avoidant’.
