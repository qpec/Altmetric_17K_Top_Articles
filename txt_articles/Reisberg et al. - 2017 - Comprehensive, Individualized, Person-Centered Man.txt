Abstract 
 
Background/Aims:  
The aim was to examine added benefits of a Comprehensive, Individual-
ized, Person-Centered Management (CI-PCM) program to memantine treatment.  
Methods: 
 
This was a 28-week, clinician-blinded, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study, with a 
similar study population, similar eligibility criteria, and a similar design to the memantine piv-
otal trial of Reisberg et al. [N Engl J Med 2003; 
  
348: 
  
1333–1341]. Twenty eligible community-
residing Alzheimer disease (AD) subject-caregiver dyads were randomized to the CI-PCM 
program (n = 10) or to usual community care (n = 10). Primary outcomes were the New York 
University Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input (NYU-CIBIC-
Plus), assessed by one clinician set, and an activities of daily living inventory, assessed by a 
separate clinician set at baseline and at weeks 4, 12, and 28.  
Results:  
Primary outcomes 
showed significant benefits of the CI-PCM program at all post-baseline evaluations. Improve-
ment on the NYU-CIBIC-Plus in the management group at 28 weeks was 2.9 points over the 
comparator group. The memantine 2003 trial showed an improvement of 0.3 points on this 
global measure in memantine-treated versus placebo-randomized subjects at 28 weeks. 
Hence, globally, the management program intervention benefits were 967% greater than me-
mantine treatment alone.  
Conclusion:  
These results are approximately 10 times those usu-
ally observed with both nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments and indicate 
substantial benefits with the management program for advanced AD persons.

Introduction 
 
The present treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) necessarily encompasses both pharma-
cological and nonpharmacological interventions. Pharmacologically, cholinesterase inhibitor 
treatments have been available for many years for mild-to-moderate AD. As a result of inves-
tigations conducted under our direction  
[1] 
 and elsewhere  
[2, 3] 
, memantine was approved 
as the first treatment for moderate-to-severe AD in the European Union  
[1, 2] 
 and, subse-
quently, in the United States  
[1–3] 
. Other studies have focused on affective and behavioral and 
psychological symptoms in AD (BPSD)  
[4–6] 
. Because these treatments are not curative, the 
advent of pharmacological treatments for persons with advanced AD accentuated the need 
for proper management of these persons.
 
 
Nonpharmacological AD treatment studies have traditionally focused on two approaches. 
One encompasses efforts to assist caregivers. These have helped, for example, by postponing 
institutionalization  
[7, 8] 
. Another approach is remediating deficits and disturbances. When 
we embarked on the present study, modalities investigated included reality orientation  
[9] 
, 
music therapy  
[10] 
, light therapy  
[11] 
, environmental interventions  
[12] 
, and validation 
therapy  
[13] 
. A combination of exercise with behavioral management had produced improve-
ments in physical functioning and mood in persons with mild-to-moderate AD  
[14] 
. When we 
initiated the present investigation, comprehensive approaches had not been systematically 
investigated in the care of persons with AD. Also, in terms of AD person care, contempora-
neous  
[15] 
 and subsequent  
[16] 
 reviews concluded that “for…outcomes (cognition, ADLs 
[activities of daily life], behavior, mood), the magnitude of the effect seemed to be similar to 
the effect obtained by drugs”  
[16] 
.
 
 
We hypothesized that a Comprehensive, Individualized, Person (Patient)-Centered 
Management (CI-PCM) program, created and implemented by Sunnie Kenowsky (S.K.), incor-
porating elements we previously described  
[17] 
, then current knowledge on AD  
[18, 19] 
 as 
well as techniques and strategies S.K. created  
[20] 
, would alleviate symptomatology and 
distress even in some of the most disturbed and impaired community-residing AD persons. 
To facilitate comparisons with pharmacological treatment, we partly modeled our study on 
our previous memantine trial  
[1] 
. Based upon a prior, exercise-only, pilot investigation, we 
hypothesized that we would see robust results with a randomized sample of 20 subjects.
 
Methods 
 
Design 
 
This was a 28-week, clinician-blinded, single-center, parallel-group study conducted in accordance with 
the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of 
Helsinki  
[21, 22] 
. The Institutional Review Board of the New York University School of Medicine approved 
the study protocol prior to study initiation, as well as subsequent modifications and continuing reviews. Also, 
prior to study initiation, the study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT00120874 URL: 
https://clinicaltrials.gov). Subjects were assigned by simple randomization to either (1) the CI-PCM inter-
vention group or (2) the comparator group, receiving usual community care (UCC) plus USD 50 financial 
compensation (FC) upon completion of baseline and week 28 study visits (total, USD 100).
 
 
A statistician, blinded to the assignment, computer-generated a sequential numerical list designating 
random study group assignments. Potential subjects were selected to be contacted by the coordinator if they 
were thought to have middle- to late-stage AD. The study coordinator assigned 54 potential participants who 
agreed to be randomized a sequential number and contacted them in numerical order. Then the coordinator 
consented all 54 potential participants to the corresponding treatments according to the procedures 
described below.
 
 
First, the subjects’ capacity to consent was determined by a qualified medical professional unassociated 
with the study. If the subjects had capacity, they signed the consent form. If they did not have capacity, the

subjects’ legally authorized representative gave written consent on behalf of the subject, and the subject gave 
oral and written assent. The subjects’ participating family and/or professional carers also gave written 
consent. Recruitment occurred from September 2005 to November 2010. All consented caregiver-subject 
dyads were screened for eligibility.
 
 
Eligible subjects were  
≥ 
50 years old, community-residing at screening, and had a family and/or profes-
sional caregiver willing and able to participate in all aspects of the study. Eligible subjects also had a diagnosis 
of dementia of the Alzheimer type by DSM-IV-TR criteria  
[23] 
 and fulfilled the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for 
probable AD  
[24] 
. These diagnoses were confirmed by medical records, physical and neurological examina-
tions, laboratory tests including corpuscular blood counts and differentials, comprehensive metabolic panels, 
and neuroimaging with computerized tomographic scans or, more commonly, brain magnetic resonance 
imaging. All subjects had moderate-to-severe AD on the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), i.e., a GDS stage of 
5 or 6  
[25] 
. Also, all subjects had a deficit in performance of basic activities of daily life, including requiring 
some assistance with putting on clothing, signified by a Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) score of  
≥ 
6a 
 
[26] 
. Additionally, eligible subjects had Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)  
[27] 
 scores of 3–14.
 
 
Exclusion criteria were: non-AD dementias, including subjects with vascular dementia or a score of >4 
on the modified Hachinski Ischemia Rating Scale  
[28] 
, major depressive disorder, clinically significant labo-
ratory abnormalities, and subjects receiving investigational medications.
 
 
After screening, 20 subject-caregiver dyads were found fulfilling the eligibility criteria. Ten dyads had 
been randomized to the CI-PCM group and 10 to the UCC+FC group. Enrollment occurred from July 21, 2006 
through November 5, 2010. Twelve subjects were enrolled in the first 2 years (these comprised 7 subjects of 
the intervention group and 5 of the comparator group), whereas 8 subjects were enrolled in the last 2 years 
(these comprised 3 subjects of the intervention group and 5 of the comparator group). Initial participants 
were delayed due to a medical injury in the sole trainer (S.K.). Subsequent enrollment was also delayed due

Subjects 
 
The characteristics of the eligible randomized subjects are shown in  
Table 1 
. There were 15 women and 
5 men, and their age ranged from 54 to 92 years at study entry. Educational background ranged from 6 to 20 
years. 
 
 
Intervention 
 
All subjects received memantine (Namenda, Forest Pharmaceuticals) titrated to a maximum tolerated 
dose of 10 mg twice daily. 
 
 
Subject-carer dyads receiving UCC+FC had their questions addressed by the AD care specialist (S.K.) 
and/or NYU Alzheimer’s Disease Center (NYU-ADC) social workers and clinicians. When appropriate, they 
were referred to the Alzheimer’s Association and other community resources for caregiver training, care 
counseling, safe return/medic alert bracelets, day care center and support group programs.
 
 
The CI-PCM intervention was developed, conducted and implemented by S.K. It included evidence-
based available knowledge and techniques as well as novel strategies and techniques developed by S.K.  
[20] 
. 
The intervention components were: caregiver training, management assessment, therapeutic home visits, 
and caregiver support groups.
 
 
Caregiver training included: a course in AD care consisting of 8 education sessions, individualized, task-
specific training, and informal instruction, for example during home visits. Education sessions, created in 
advance by S.K., consisted of  
≥ 
3 h of didactic training weekly, at the NYU-ADC, for the first 8 study weeks. 
Sessions focused on: (1) the pathogenesis  
[29] 
, course and personal impact of AD, retrogenesis, develop-
mental age equivalence and management principles of AD care  
[17, 18, 30, 31] 
; (2) the impact of AD on 
communication and how to communicate effectively with persons with AD  
[32, 33] 
; (3) the nature, occur-
rence, identification, causes and management of BPSD, including how to determine meaning and possible 
responses   
[4, 5, 20, 34–36] 
; (4) prevention and management strategies developed by S.K. as well as appro-
priate  carer responses to BPSD  
[20] 
; (5) activities: which to do and how; (6) exercises, cognitive and language 
stimulation: what to do and how; (7) how to remedy deficits and teach persons with AD skills they have 
forgotten using memory coaching  
[20] 
, activities and spaced retrieval  
[37] 
; and (8) nutrition, how to recognize 
and manage medical problems in AD persons, and caregiver stress. Some intervention principles, techniques 
and procedures are summarized in  
Table 2 
  
[17, 19, 25–27, 30, 33, 34, 36, 38–41] 
.
 
 
Subsequent carer questions were addressed in twice monthly support group meetings and residential 
visits. There was an initial residential visit. Subsequent visits were at the subject’s residence, S.K.’s office, or 
the NYU-ADC. There were  
≥ 
4 visits over the first 8 study weeks. Additional visits, at least monthly, were 
conducted as necessary. During these visits, (1) the environment was assessed and modifications to enhance 
safety and functioning were suggested, (2) recommendations were made for appropriate levels of care, 
supervision and caregiver assistance, (3) a plan of activities to remediate deficits, enhance functioning, and

Table 2. Intervention principles, techniques and procedures
Principles
To some extent, these principles have been previously described by the authors in the science of Alzheimer 
disease (AD) management [17, 30, 34]. The principles include universal human treatment principles which 
are frequently and continuously forgotten in the care of, and in interactions with, persons living with 
moderate-to-severe AD. Specific principles taught to participants in the Comprehensive, Individualized, 
Person-Centered Management (CI-PCM) group include:
1.
Caregivers need to educate themselves so they understand and gain an appreciation of the course of 
AD and the resultant losses experienced by the person with AD; the AD person’s needs as a 
consequence of their losses and how to interact appropriately with the person with AD.
2.
AD follows a progressive, ordinal course of loss described functionally by the Functional Assessment 
Staging (FAST) procedure [26] and globally by the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) [25] stages. 
3.
The course of AD mirrors in a degenerative reverse order of loss the processes of acquisition in 
normal human development. This AD process of progressive losses has been termed retrogenesis [17].
4.
Stages of AD can be translated into corresponding developmental ages (DA) with some caveats, such 
as the AD person does not physically regress in size [17]. Additionally, the person with AD is an adult 
with a life history of individual experiences. The FAST, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [27] 
and DA are assessment tools that help to determine the approximate level of the person with AD and 
which provide useful guidance when planning activities, social interactions and general care. It is 
important to interact with the person with AD on their level and in the present moment.
5.
Learning to understand and respect the person with AD as well as gaining an appreciation for what 
they are experiencing creates empathy and patience in the carer and bonds the carer and care 
receiver. Development of this bond into a trusting, loving, therapeutic relationship becomes the basis 
and foundation of effective caregiving.
6.
Persons with AD are to be treated with dignity and respect as a person, not as an object. The AD 
person should be acknowledged, valued and honored, instead of being ridiculed. Caregivers must 
provide authentic care. The AD person should be treated as though they are present at all times. 
Forcing, or attempts to control the AD person as if they are an object, is NOT acceptable care unless 
necessary to ensure the AD person’s immediate life safety.
7.
Care needs to be individualized in accord with what holds value and meaning for the AD person, their 
family and carers. Individual preferences need to be honored. This can be achieved by learning the 
AD person’s history, individual tastes and preferences, talents, shortcomings and personal needs.
8.
Previous experiences, strengths and deficits may help elucidate the kinds of activities which a person 
living with AD can participate in and enjoy. For example, one person with AD who was at GDS stage 6 
and FAST stage 6a, with an MMSE score of 4, was able to resume playing the guitar, and learned, at 
that time, to play the harmonica for the first time.
9.
Establish a healthy, supportive, structured and flexible routine with daily fun scheduled in the 
routine.
10.
Persons living with AD progressively lose the ability to fulfill their own needs and eventually need 
assistance to fulfill even their most basic needs. AD persons continue to require love, shelter, safety 
and security. Caregivers need to learn to recognize basic human needs. They also must learn to 
identify and help to fulfill the AD person’s needs. For example, all human beings have a need for self-
esteem and self-respect. People with AD who previously fulfilled these needs by engaging in a 
profession or hobby are no longer able to gain needed recognition when they lose the ability to 
perform their job or their hobby. Using Memory Coaching to teach the AD person new skills, or skills 
they may have forgotten helps rebuild the AD person’s self-esteem and self-respect.
11.
Persons living with moderate-to-severe AD continue to have social needs for love and belonging. 
When the AD person loses the ability to independently visit family and friends and engage in society, 
AD carers can fill these needs by their personally interacting socially with the AD person, by helping 
the AD person to engage in new relationships, as well as by arranging appointments and dates with 
significant family and friends.

12.
The emotional changes which occur in the person living with AD are related to the person’s cognitive, 
physical, psychological, social and emotional losses, and their environment [19, 30, 34]. For example, 
persons with AD who forget where they put things may develop the common delusion that “people 
are stealing things” [34, 36]. This can be remedied by building trust and helping the person living 
with AD to find missing materials, thereby increasing their sense of security.
13.
Caregivers need to learn how to take care of themselves without neglecting the health or welfare of 
the person with AD.
Techniques and procedures
Activities should be success promoting. A guiding principle in all of the techniques and procedures 
described below is that the activities should be success promoting, and that success should be assessed by 
the AD person’s achievements, not by the AD person’s disabilities. Activities should be individualized, 
meaningful, safe and as enjoyable as possible for the person living with AD. In general, the dignity and self-
esteem of the person living with AD should be promoted. The environment should be modified for success. 
Activities should promote engagement and independence. Begin with what the person with AD can do and 
build on residual strengths:
1.
Memory Coaching: Memory Coaching is an important technique developed by S.K. This technique 
builds upon retrogenesis principles, in particular the recognition that persons living with moderate-
to-severe AD have the capacity to learn. Although rehabilitation is widely practiced in modern 
medicine, perhaps because AD is viewed as a degenerative disease and professionals are unaware of 
how to successfully interact with and teach persons with AD, meaningful restoration of lost 
capacities, or rehabilitation, rarely occurs. Memory Coaching was employed in this study to teach 
persons living with AD, in the CI-PCM subject group, how to accomplish activities and skills they had 
forgotten, as well as how to accomplish new skills. A few examples of how Memory Coaching was 
employed in this study include coaching the AD person: to walk again after losing the ability to walk 
due to a fall and a resulting hip fracture secondary in part to osteoporosis; to maintain or regain 
urinary continence; to maintain or regain fecal continence; to make a cell phone call; to eat with a 
knife and fork again; to get a drink from the refrigerator and drink it; to play a musical instrument; to 
go to sleep at night; to clear the dishes from the table and wash the dishes. The result can be a 
restoration of functioning and dignity as well as increased self-esteem, satisfaction and an improved 
mood for the person living with AD.
2.
Provision of appropriate care: all of the persons living with AD in this study had basic activity of daily 
life deficits associated with the level of their dementia. Consequently, all of these persons required 
full-time supervision. In this context, recommendations were made for the provision of appropriate 
levels of supervision and caregiver assistance, carer training was provided and day care assistance 
was recommended when indicated.
3.
Vigilance with respect to the vulnerability of persons living with AD: a corollary of the AD person’s 
need for appropriate care is their attendant vulnerability. At the stages we studied (FAST stages ≥6a), 
persons with AD are susceptible to social deprivation, poor care, and physical as well as emotional 
insults. Therefore, efforts were made to minimize this vulnerability by providing the persons living 
with AD with socialization experiences, appropriate care, and alerting carers to signs of possible 
emotional or physical insult or abuse.
4.
Provision of physical activity regimens: persons living with AD require stage-appropriate physical 
movement. As AD emerges, persons develop increasing equilibrium and coordination deficits [38]. 
Most persons at the severity level of the subjects in this report have also been found to have 
decreased walking speed, decreased arm swing, and a small stepped gait [39]. Overt physical 
deformities, known as contractures, become prevalent later in the course of AD, but were observed in 
3% of subjects studied in FAST stage 6 [40]. Therefore, this program emphasized individualized 
physical activities in persons with AD which were appropriate for the AD person’s physical condition 
and ability. These activities included participating to an optimal extent in dressing themselves, 
independent feeding skills, and other basic daily life activities. The exercises included: gross and fine 
motor activities, physical strengthening, stretching, range of motion, coordination and balance 
exercises as well as aerobic exercise.

maintain abilities was developed and instituted in accordance with the subject’s interests, stage, envi-
ronment, and capacity, (4) a subject-specific exercise plan was initiated, (5) subjects were memory coached 
in skills and abilities which had been diminished or lost, such as continence of urine and feces, walking, eating 
with utensils, sewing, etc., and (6) caregivers were taught how to continue the previously instituted 
management program.
 
 
After the education sessions concluded, caregiver support group meetings were held twice a month for 
20 weeks. Caregiver stress identification and management was taught, as well as how to take care of oneself 
first without neglecting the AD person. New and incipient problems were recognized, possible solutions were 
discussed, and successes were shared and celebrated. Participants were taught the stages of grief and actively 
grieved their losses and those of the AD person. Caregivers also learned teamwork and mutual support.
 
 
Outcome Measures 
 
Outcomes were assessed at the NYU-ADC at baseline and at 4, 12, and 28 weeks. The primary efficacy 
variables were: (1) the New York University (NYU) Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus 
Caregiver Input global score (NYU-CIBIC-Plus)  
[42] 
, and (2) the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study 
Activities of Daily Living Inventory modified for more severe dementia  
[43] 
, abbreviated version comprised 
of the first 12 questions (ADCS-ADLsev-abv). Secondary outcomes included: cognitive measures, i.e., the 
Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)  
[44] 
 and the MMSE  
[27] 
; a functional measure, i.e., the FAST-Disability 
Score (FAST-DS)  
[42] 
; a behavioral pathology assessment, i.e., the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer’s 
Disease Frequency-Weighted Severity Scale (BEHAVE-AD-FW)  
[45] 
; a syncretic measure assessing 
memory, emotional and other behavioral problems, i.e., the Revised Memory and Behavior Problems 
5.
Training in language skills: vocabulary and other language skills decline continuously throughout the 
course of AD [33]. At the end of FAST stage 6, in FAST 6e, speech ability begins to overtly break down 
[41]. Accordingly, language skills were taught to persons living with AD at their stage level. These 
skills included practice in speaking, writing, reading aloud, as well as the use of word and picture 
flash cards.
6.
Provision of appropriate socialization: at the severity level of the persons in this study, persons with 
AD can no longer construct their socialization experiences independently. Therefore, appropriate and 
enriching social experiences must be encouraged and where appropriate, arranged. For example, 
carers can be encouraged to take the person living with AD out for lunch. Similarly, social experiences 
with the AD person’s friends and relatives can be arranged. Persons with a particular spiritual or 
religious belief may be encouraged to participate in the associated community activities of that belief. 
On a regular basis, in accordance with individual preferences, persons living with AD should be 
encouraged to participate in marketing as well as in meal preparation. Where appropriate and 
practical, visits to parks, museums, trips to the movies or to the theater, etc. should be arranged. For 
persons who have an interest in clothing, the carer(s) should be encouraged to have the person living 
with AD make their own choices and participate in purchasing new clothing and other garments. 
Also, the AD person’s appearance on outings should be optimized in accord with their preferences.

Medical management instruction: study visits were used to teach carers how to bring the subject to a 
medical appointment and help the subject to tolerate medical procedures. Caregivers were instructed 
in methodologies for the assessment of AD persons, such as how to recognize and attend to medical 
problems, and simple methodologies for keeping a medical history and a record of prescription 
medications, vitamins and supplements. The caregivers were instructed in how to advocate for the 
AD patient. Carers were taught to value the AD person and to provide psychological care as well as 
physical care. Caregivers were taught to work against the withdrawal and inactivity which commonly 
occur in AD persons in FAST stage 6 by arranging for physical exercise and outdoor activities. The 
caregivers were also instructed in providing the AD person with love and support, in arranging for 
novel activities, and in remedying deficits. Individualized physical care was taught during home 
visits. This included proper perineal care and cleanliness, bathing, transferring, and assessing vital 
signs. Instruction was also provided in methodologies for the prevention of decubiti, infections, such 
as urinary tract infections, and the prevention of contractures.

; and a global measure, i.e., the GDS  
[25] 
. Subjects and carers were assessed by 2 
sets of clinicians: one group performed the NYU-CIBIC-Plus assessment and the second group the other 
measures. All clinicians were unaware of the treatment group assignment. In accord with standard NYU-
CIBIC-Plus scale procedures, clinicians performing the NYU-CIBIC-Plus (primarily I.B., J.G., and M.S.) 
assessed subjects and caregivers without reference or access to any other study data at the time of their 
assessment.
 
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
In order to compare the results with the 2003 memantine pivotal trial, which was a model for the 
present investigation  
[1] 
, efficacy outcomes were analyzed, using the R version 3.2.5, by applying the 
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for independent samples to the change from baseline. The level of significance 
is 5% and hypothesis tests are 2-sided. We report intention-to-treat analyses. For the NYU-CIBIC-Plus, we 
report analyses both for the total group ( 
n 
 = 20) as well as for a group of  
n 
 = 19, excluding 1 subject due
to a data quality concern (online suppl. Fig.; see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000455397 for all online 
suppl. material, ). The results of the 2 analyses are almost identical.
 
 
In the 2003 study, we observed a mean difference of 0.3 between the NYU-CIBIC-Plus primary outcome 
of the 2 groups (memantine vs. placebo) with a common SD = 1.1. With a sample size of 10 + 10 = 20, assuming 
a similar SD, at the 5% alpha level, we have 93% power to detect a mean difference of 1.8 (6 times 0.3) using 
a 2-sided, 2-sample  
t 
 test.

Results 
 
Outcomes 
 
All 20 eligible subjects and their primary caregivers completed the 28-week study. Study 
outcomes are shown in  
Figures 2–9 
 and in the online supplement (see online suppl. Fig.).
 
 
For the NYU-CIBIC-Plus, due to a data quality concern, data from 1 subject, a 79-year-old 
woman assigned to the UCC+FC group, were excluded.  
Figure 2 
 shows the result of the 
remaining 19 subjects. By convention, the baseline for the NYU-CIBIC-Plus assessment is set 
at 4, which signifies “no change.” For post-baseline assessments, lower values signify 
improvement, with 3 meaning “minimally improved,” a score of 2 meaning “moderately 
improved,” and a score of 1 meaning “markedly improved.” Higher scores on the NYU-CIBIC-
Plus signify “worsening.” Specifically, scores of 5, 6, and 7 correspond to “minimally worse,” 
“moderately worse,” and “markedly worse,” respectively. Beginning with the first post-
baseline evaluation at week 4, the CI-PCM intervention group showed improvement on this 
primary outcome global measure. In contrast, subjects receiving UCC+FC treatment showed 
worsening on the NYU-CIBIC-Plus at each post-baseline evaluation period. Between-group 
differences were significant at week 4 (CI-PCM intervention group 2.6 ± 0.4 [SE], UCC+FC 
comparator group 4.3 ± 0.4 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.05) and more robustly significant at week 12 (CI-PCM 
intervention group 2.2 ± 0.3 [SE], UCC+FC comparator group 5.0 ± 0.5 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.01) and week 
28 (CI-PCM intervention group 2.3 ± 0.4 [SE], UCC+FC comparator group 5.2 ± 0.5 [SE],  
p 
 < 
0.01). Similarly robust outcomes were observed in the analysis with the entire ( 
n 
 = 20) subject 
population (see online suppl. Fig. and suppl. Fig. legend).
 
 
The other primary outcome was the ADCS-ADLsev-abv on which a higher score indicates 
greater capacities. At baseline, the ADCS-ADLsev-abv mean score for the CI-PCM intervention 
subject group was 15.3 ± 2.0 (SE) and the mean score for the UCC+FC comparator subject 
group was 14.8 ± 2.1 (SE). As shown in  
Figure 3 
, the CI-PCM intervention group improved in 
this assessment, in comparison with baseline, at all post-baseline assessments. In contrast,

the UCC+FC comparator subjects worsened in ADCS-ADLsev-abv scores, in comparison with 
the baseline score, at all post-baseline assessments. Differences between the CI-PCM inter-
vention and the UCC+FC comparator groups were robustly significant at week 4 (CI-PCM 
intervention group 20.1 ± 2.6 [SE], UCC+FC comparator group 13.2 ± 1.8 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.01), signif-
icant at week 12 (CI-PCM intervention group 19.7 ± 2.4 [SE], UCC+FC comparator group 12.5 
± 2.3 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.05), and very robustly significant at week 28 (CI-PCM intervention group 21.9 
± 2.5 [SE], UCC+FC comparator group 9.6 ± 1.9 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.001).
 
 
Results for secondary outcomes are shown in  
Figures 4–9 
. The cognitive secondary 
outcome assessments were the SIB and the MMSE. For both of these measures, a higher score 
is indicative of better performance. The baseline mean score for the CI-PCM intervention 
group on the SIB was 49.8 ± 9.9 (SE) and the mean score for the UCC+FC comparator group 
was 65.5 ± 8.5 (SE). The baseline mean score for the CI-PCM intervention group on the MMSE 
was 7.0 ± 1.2 (SE) and the baseline mean MMSE score for the UCC+FC comparator group was 
9.0 ± 1.3 (SE). Neither objective cognitive assessment showed significant between-group 
differences at any observation period ( 
Fig. 4 
,  
5 
). The functioning secondary outcome was the 
FAST-DS on which a higher score indicates greater impairment. At baseline, the mean 
FAST-DS of the intervention group was 6.6 ± 0.1 (SE). The baseline mean FAST-DS of the 
comparator group was also 6.6 ± 0.1 (SE). The FAST-DS showed significant benefit in the 
CI-PCM group at week 4 (CI-PCM intervention group 6.5 ± 0.1 [SE], UCC+FC comparator 
group 6.6 ± 0.1 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.05) and at week 12 (CI-PCM intervention group 6.3 ± 0.2 [SE], 
UCC+FC comparator group 6.6 ± 0.1 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.05) and a robustly significant benefit at week 
28 (CI-PCM intervention group 6.2 ± 0.2 [SE], UCC+FC comparator group 6.8 ± 0.1 [SE],  
p 
 < 
0.01) ( 
Fig. 6 
). For the behavioral disturbance evaluation, we applied the BEHAVE-AD-FW, on 
which a higher score indicates increased magnitude and frequency of behavioral distur-
bances. At baseline, the CI-PCM intervention subject group had a mean score of 25.1 ± 5.5 
(SE) and the UCC+FC comparator subject group had a mean score of 21.6 ± 4.2 (SE). Hence, 
at baseline, there was more behavioral disturbance in the future CI-PCM intervention

and there was more behavioral disturbance in the UCC+FC comparator subject group than 
in the CI-PCM intervention subject group. At week 12, the BEHAVE-AD-FW assessment

significantly less frequent problems in the CI-PCM intervention group (CI-PCM intervention 
group 23.8 ± 3.6 [SE], UCC+FC comparator group 34.9 ± 3.0 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.05) ( 
Fig. 8 
). For the 
reaction component of the RMBPC which assesses “how bothered or upset” the caregiver 
was by the subject’s memory and behavior, a significantly lower magnitude of reaction was 
present at baseline for the subjects assigned to the UCC+FC group (i.e., 6.0 ± 3.3 [SE]) in 
comparison with the magnitude of “bother or upset” observed in the CI-PCM-assigned 
subjects (i.e., a score of 14.2 ± 4.7 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.05,  
Fig. 9 
). At all post-baseline evaluations, the 
pattern completely reversed and significantly lower “bothered or upset” reactions were 
observed in the CI-PCM subjects at week 4 (CI-PCM intervention group 2.7 ± 1.2 [SE], UCC+FC 
comparator group 9.2 ± 4.9 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.05), at week 12 (CI-PCM intervention group 3.4 ± 1.3 
[SE], UCC+FC comparator group 9.3 ± 3.0 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.05), and at week 28 (CI-PCM inter-
vention group 2.0 ± 0.8 [SE], UCC+FC comparator group 10.7 ± 4.5 [SE],  
p 
 < 0.05) in comparison 
with the UCC+FC subjects ( 
Fig. 9 
).
 
 
All 20 eligible subjects were at GDS stage 6 at baseline and the 4-week evaluation point. 
Seventeen were also at GDS stage 6 at all subsequent observation periods. Three subjects, all 
from the CI-PCM treatment group, improved to a GDS stage of 5 at the 12-week ( 
n 
 = 1) or at 
the 28-week ( 
n 
 = 2) post-baseline evaluations. There were no significant between-group 
differences in the GDS stage at any study evaluation point.
 
 
The primary outcomes were consistent in demonstrating positive effects of the CI-PCM 
intervention in comparison with UCC+FC at all post-baseline evaluations.
 
 
Secondary outcomes were consistent in supporting positive effects of the CI-PCM inter-
vention on functioning and behavioral disturbances, with no significant effect on cognition. 
For the functioning outcomes and for 2 of the 3 behavioral disturbance outcome assess-
ments, the significance level of improvement was greater at the final 28-week evaluations 
than at the initial 4-week evaluations. For the remaining behavioral disturbance outcome 
assessment, the significance level of improvement was the same at all post-baseline assess-
ments.

Discussion 
 
This study was modeled in part on the pivotal monotherapy trial associated with the EU 
and FDA approval of memantine  
[1] 
. Both studies had similar or identical inclusion criteria 
including age  
≥ 
50 years, DSM-IV  
[23] 
 diagnoses of AD and the criteria of McKhann et al.  
[24] 
 
for probable AD, a FAST  
[26] 
 score  
≥ 
6a, an MMSE  
[27] 
 score of 3–14, and a Rosen-Hachinski 
rating  
[28] 
 of  
≤ 
4. The mean MMSE score at baseline was 7.90 in the 2003 study and 7.85 in 
the present study and the duration was 28 weeks in both studies. Both studies required 
reliable caregiver informants. A major difference between the studies was observed in 
outcomes which can be compared considering the NYU-CIBIC-Plus primary outcome. By 
convention, the baseline score for the CIBIC-Plus assessment is set at “4.” Subsequent scores 
<4 indicate progressive levels of improvement and scores >4 indicate progressive levels of 
worsening. In the 2003 study, both treatment (memantine) and control (placebo) subjects 
declined on this global assessment ( 
Fig. 10 
) and the difference between the medication and 
placebo subject groups, with the observed-cases analysis, was 0.3 points.
 
 
In the present study, in which both subject groups received memantine treatment, the 
subject group which received memantine and UCC+FC once again showed a decline on the 
NYU-CIBIC-Plus. The major difference between the 2003 pivotal trial and the present study

Mean NYU-CIBIC-Plus score ± standard deviation (given in parentheses) at each study period is shown. For 
scoring details, see the legend of  
Figure 2 
. The current UCC+FC group might appear to be different from the 
2003 pivotal trial memantine treatment and placebo treatment groups on the NYU-CIBIC-Plus assessment. 
However, the UCC+FC treatment group has a much smaller sample size. Therefore, the differences in the 
UCC+FC group results in the present study are not significantly different from the treatment or the placebo 
group in the 2003 controlled trial on the NYU-CIBIC-Plus assessment.

is that in the 2003 trial the intervention subject group which received memantine treatment 
declined from baseline on the NYU-CIBIC-Plus by 0.4 points. In contrast, the CI-PCM plus 
memantine treatment group from the present study showed an improvement from baseline 
on the NYU-CIBIC-Plus of 1.7 points. Overall, the CI-PCM plus memantine treatment subjects 
improved by 2.9 points on the NYU-CIBIC-Plus compared with the memantine treatment plus 
UCC+FC subject group. Of course, the participants in both study groups of the 2003 pivotal 
trial also received UCC and the USD 100 compensation in the present study comparator group 
is unlikely to have meaningful clinical benefits. Therefore, the present results can be inter-
preted as improving the effects seen with medication treatment by a factor of 9.67 in 
comparison with the 0.3-point NYU-CIBIC-Plus improvement observed in the 2003 study of 
memantine versus placebo (i.e., a 967% improvement over medication treatment alone). This 
is approximately 10 times the traditional effect size previously observed with nonpharmaco-
logical interventions  
[15, 16] 
. We attribute the huge incremental effect in part to the severity 
range and corresponding needs of the subjects in both of these studies as well as to the ther-
apeutic methodologies we employed in the CI-PCM program, which have been summarized 
herein. 
 
 
A very brief case summary may be useful to further elucidate the procedures employed 
with the CI-PCM program participants. 
 
 
The sole daughter and caregiver (C.G.) was taught tools and techniques to help her mother 
(M.G.) during the education sessions and home visits. C.G. was then able to better care for her 
mother relieving significant carer stress and anxiety regarding her ability to properly care for 
her mother. Using memory coaching and various other strategies, C.G. was able to teach her 
mother to be urinary continent and sleep through the night. This alleviated M.G.’s disruptive 
behavior of rummaging through the refrigerator for snacks in the middle of the night and 
allowed both C.G. and M.G. to get some much needed rest. Being urinary continent meant 
there was much less laundry to do, further lightening the care burden. Additionally, M.G. was 
taught activities which she could do autonomously, with little to no supervision. For example, 
these activities included crossword puzzles and folding laundry. Participation in these activ-
ities served to mitigate M.G.’s purposeless repetitive behaviors, such as opening and closing 
a purse endlessly. As a result of these strategies, the subject’s daughter had time to accom-
plish tax paperwork, other important personal tasks, and she also had time to relax for a few 
moments of much needed respite. 
 
 
Additionally, we have recently published a relatively detailed case history of a woman 
with AD, whom we (B.R. and S.K.) had treated over a period of nearly 14 years  
[47] 
. Initially, 
this woman (S.M.) was at GDS and FAST stage 5, indicating moderate AD, and had an MMSE 
score of 19. We followed S.M. over 13 years and 9 months. Over this time, when she was at 
GDS stage 6 and FAST stage 6c, and had an MMSE score of 2, she took up doing freestyle water-
color paintings for the first time. Subsequently, we showed a picture of her carrying a cake 
and smiling sociably, 2 years after her MMSE score had reached 0. Over the nearly 14-year 
period, the subject progressed at less than half the rate typically observed in otherwise 
healthy AD persons.
 
 
In summary, from the evaluations of 2 independent groups of raters and observations 
with multiple rating instruments for each symptomatic domain, we conclude that the CI-PCM 
program in persons with moderate-to-severe AD improved functional and behavioral distur-
bance symptomatology. No significant effects on cognition were observed. Globally, the 
magnitude of improvement in these community-residing persons with AD appears to have 
been approximately 10 times that conventionally observed in AD nonpharmacological as well 
as, ostensibly, successful pivotal pharmacological AD trials. As a cure for AD remains elusive, 
these results, if replicated, might point the way toward less suffering for both carers and 
persons with advanced AD.

Disclosure Statement 
 
Dr. Reisberg is the developer or codeveloper and copyright holder of several of the assessment instru-
ments used in this study. These instruments were selected because of their sensitivity in the severity range 
of the study subjects, their relevance for the respective domains of interest, and, in several instances, also 
because of their use in the 2003 pivotal trial of memantine efficacy, with which the present study results are, 
to a large extent, being compared. Specifically, these copyrighted instruments are: the New York University 
Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (NYU-CIBIC-Plus, codeveloper and a 
copyright holder), the Functional Assessment Staging procedure and its associated disability scoring 
(developer and copyright holder), the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease Frequency-Weighted 
Severity Scale (developer and copyright holder), and the Global Deterioration Scale (developer and copyright 
holder). These instruments were provided for the study at no charge. None of the other authors of this study 
have any conflicts of interest to declare.
