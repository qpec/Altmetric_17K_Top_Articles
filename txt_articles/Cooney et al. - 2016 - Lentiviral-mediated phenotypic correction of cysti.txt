Introduction
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmem-
brane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (1, 2). The most common CFTR mutation is a phenylalanine 
deletion at amino acid position 508 (ΔF508), however there are over 2,000 different disease-associated 
CFTR mutations. CF affects multiple organ systems, yet progressive lung disease, characterized by recur-
rent bacterial infections and inflammation, is the leading cause of CF morbidity and mortality (3). CFTR 
mutations result in impaired anion transport. This contributes to lung disease, in part, through reduced 
airway surface liquid pH (ASL pH), defective bacterial killing, and reduced mucociliary transport (MCT) 
(4–6). While new CFTR potentiator (7, 8) and corrector (9) therapies are now in the clinic, there remains 
a great need to develop treatments for all people with CF.
Gene therapy is a mutation agnostic approach to restore CFTR activity. Lentiviral vectors trans-
duce both dividing and nondividing cells, integrate into the host genome, and provide long-term trans-
gene expression (10, 11). A feline immunodeficiency virus–based (FIV-based) viral vector pseudotyped 
with the baculovirus envelope protein GP64 transduces epithelial cells at the apical surface and per-
sistently expresses a transgene of interest in mouse airways (12, 13). We previously demonstrated that 
FIV pseudotyped with the GP64 envelope from baculovirus efficiently transduces both human and pig 
airway epithelia (12, 14). Here, we use a lentiviral vector to deliver a CFTR expression cassette to pig 
airways in vivo.
At birth, CF pigs manifest physiologic defects associated with loss of CFTR function, including a 
reduced ASL pH, impaired bacterial killing, and reduced MCT (15–18). In this single time point pilot 
study, we hypothesized that delivery of GP64-FIV-CFTR to the sinuses and lower respiratory tract of 
newborn CF pigs would correct the anion channel defect. We show that delivery of GP64 pseudotyped 
FIV-CFTR to newborn CF pigs (19) can achieve partial physiological correction of the defective anion 
transport and its host defense consequences in vivo.
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in CF transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR), resulting in defective anion transport. Regardless of the disease-
causing mutation, gene therapy is a strategy to restore anion transport to airway epithelia. Indeed, 
viral vector–delivered CFTR can complement the anion channel defect. In this proof-of-principle 
study, functional in vivo CFTR channel activity was restored in the airways of CF pigs using a feline 
immunodeficiency virus–based (FIV-based) lentiviral vector pseudotyped with the GP64 envelope. 
Three newborn CF pigs received aerosolized FIV-CFTR to the nose and lung. Two weeks after 
viral vector delivery, epithelial tissues were analyzed for functional correction. In freshly excised 
tracheal and bronchus tissues and cultured ethmoid sinus cells, we observed a significant increase 
in transepithelial cAMP-stimulated current, evidence of functional CFTR. In addition, we observed 
increases in tracheal airway surface liquid pH and bacterial killing in CFTR vector–treated animals. 
Together, these data provide the first evidence to our knowledge that lentiviral delivery of CFTR can 
partially correct the anion channel defect in a large-animal CF model and validate a translational 
strategy to treat or prevent CF lung disease.

Results
FIV-CFTR corrects the anion channel defect in vitro. Multiple 
studies have established that CFTR complementation 
restores the anion channel defect in vitro (20–23). Before 
we delivered vector to CF pigs, we first confirmed that 
lentiviral-mediated porcine CFTR delivery corrects the 
anion defect in primary cultures of CF airway epithe-
lia. Well-differentiated airway epithelial cultures derived 
from CF pig ethmoid sinuses were transduced apically 
with 4 × 107 transducing units (TU) of GP64-pseudo-
typed FIV-CFTR (MOI = 5). Four days after transduction, the bioelectric properties of epithelia were analyzed 
in Ussing chambers. FIV-CFTR–treated cells demonstrated a significant increase in transepithelial Cl– current 
in response to forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, F&I). (Figure 1, A and B). The current was 
inhibited by the CFTR channel blocker, GlyH-101 (Figure 1, A and C). CFTR subcellular localization was 
examined using IHC. CFTR protein localized to the apical membrane in both ciliated and nonciliated epithelial 
cells (Figure 1D) and was absent in the untreated CF epithelia (Figure 1E). These data suggest that apical deliv-
ery of FIV-CFTR to primary airway epithelia can correct the anion channel defect in vitro.
FIV-CFTR rescues the anion channel defect in CF pig trachea and bronchus. To test the efficacy of FIV-CFTR 
in vivo, we aerosolized 6 × 109 TU of concentrated FIV-CFTR formulated with methylcellulose (24) into 
the ethmoid sinus and trachea of 3 newborn gut-corrected CF pigs. Gut-corrected CF pigs express CFTR 
in intestinal tissues but lack CFTR expression in the airways (19). Two weeks after vector delivery, tissues 
were collected and analyzed for CFTR correction. Tissues from untreated CF pigs showed little response to 
either F&I or GlyH-101 (Figure 2, A–D). In freshly excised tracheal tissues from the CF pigs treated with 
FIV-CFTR, a significant increase in cAMP-activated Cl– current was observed to near WT levels (Figure 
2A). This current decreased in response to GlyH-101 (Figure 2B). A similar result was obtained for freshly 
excised bronchus tissue (Figure 2, C and D). We also quantified CFTR mRNA abundance in treated and 
untreated animals. In FIV-CFTR–treated trachea and bronchus tissues, we observed CFTR mRNA levels 
that were increased significantly over the average background levels detected in untreated CF pig tissue 
(Figure 2E). Together, these findings confirm that delivery of a CFTR expression cassette by a lentiviral 
vector can partially correct the anion defect in the trachea and bronchus of CF pigs in vivo.
We collected genomic DNA from tracheal and bronchial tissues from FIV-CFTR–treated and untreat-
ed animals. The tissues included multiple cell types, including surface epithelia, basal cells, submucosal 
glands, basal lamina, and smooth muscle. Thus, not all cells sampled were surface epithelial cells. Using 
quantitative PCR (qPCR), we attempted to quantify the levels of DNA integration; however, the levels were 
below the limit of detection, i.e., less than 1 copy per 10 cells (data not shown). Because the tissues repre-
sent a mixed cell population, including many that received no vector, detecting CFTR transgene copy num-
ber in airway epithelial cells is challenging. However, these results suggest that, in the conducting airways, 
partial CFTR anion channel correction can be achieved by integrating a transgene in a small percentage

of cells. We postulate that overexpressing CFTR with a heterologous promoter in a small subset of airway 
cells may help compensate for low overall gene transfer efficiency.
Partial rescue of  ASL pH and bacterial killing in CF pigs. The loss of bicarbonate transport through 
CFTR results in acidification of the ASL and subsequent inhibition of antimicrobial factors, thereby 
impairing bacterial killing (16). Therefore, we next determined if CFTR complementation by FIV-CFTR 
increased the ASL pH and improves ASL antimicrobial activity. Two weeks after vector delivery, we 
measured tracheal pH (16, 25). Compared with untreated animals, average tracheal ASL pH increased 
from 7.0 to 7.2 (Figure 3A); however, this trend did not reach statistical significance. The average ASL 
pH of the FIV-CFTR–treated group was nearly identical to the non-CF pig group.
To assess ASL antimicrobial activity, we interrogated individual bacteria attached to gold grids, as 
previously described (16). As shown in Figure 3B, the ASL from CF pigs that received FIV-CFTR had an 
increased bacterial killing ability as compared with untreated CF pigs. Bacterial killing activity measure-
ments in a third CF pig that received FIV-CFTR failed due to technical complications; thus, statistical 
comparisons were not performed. We concluded that complementation of the anion channel defect in vivo 
by lentiviral vector transduction has the potential to increase ASL pH and bacterial killing.
Cultured ethmoid sinus epithelia from FIV-CFTR–treated CF pigs show rescue of  anion current and ASL pH. The 
CF pigs in this study received vector to both the nasal and pulmonary airways. Two weeks after delivery, 
the ethmoid sinuses were harvested and epithelia were enzymatically dispersed, cultured on collagen-coat-
ed filters, and grown at an air-liquid interface. After differentiation in culture, ethmoid sinus epithelia were 
mounted in Ussing chambers to measure CFTR anion channel activity. Culturing ethmoid epithelial cells

was necessary because ethmoid tissue cannot be directly mounted in the Ussing chambers. As shown in 
Figure 4, A and B, in cells from FIV-CFTR–treated animals, we observed an increase in transepithelial 
CFTR-dependent Cl– conductance. This current was blocked by GlyH-101 (Figure 4, A and C). No change 
in current was observed in cells from untreated animals. In addition to functional Cl– channel correction, 
we observed a significant increase in ASL pH in epithelia cultured from the pigs that received FIV-CFTR 
(Figure 4D). Together, these results provide evidence of functional correction of CF anion transport and 
ASL pH defects by a lentiviral vector in the ethmoid sinus in vivo.
Discussion
Here, we show functional CFTR complementation in a large animal model. Two weeks after aerosolized 
FIV-CFTR delivery to CF pig lungs, freshly excised tracheal and bronchial tissues exhibited partial restoration 
of cAMP-stimulated anion conductance. The response was blocked by the CFTR inhibitor, GlyH-101. We also 
observed an increase in CFTR mRNA levels in treated tissues. Loss of CFTR function leads to the development 
of chronic bacterial lung infections (26, 27). In CF pigs, loss of CFTR-mediated bicarbonate transport leads 
to acidic airways and impaired bacterial killing (16). The CF pigs that received FIV-CFTR in our experiments 
showed a trend toward an increase in both tracheal ASL pH and bacterial killing. Cultured nasal epithelial 
cells from the pigs receiving FIV-CFTR also demonstrated partial restoration of anion channel activity and a 
significant increase in ASL pH comparable with WT levels, even after 2 weeks in culture. Together, these data 
provide the first evidence of CFTR correction in a large-animal model by a lentiviral vector.
Three well-studied candidate viral vector platforms for CF gene therapy include adenovirus, 
 
adeno-associated virus, and lentivirus (28). In addition, nonviral approaches are under study and in

clinical trials (29, 30). Each viral vector has its own unique attributes and limitations. In the presence of 
reagents that disrupt tight junctions, adenovirus robustly transduces airway epithelia. However, adeno-
viral-mediated transgene expression wanes quickly due to the robust immune-mediated response (31). 
Adeno-associated virus persists long-term but has a relatively small carrying capacity for a transgene as 
large as CFTR. In a companion manuscript by Steines and colleagues (32), this limitation is circumvent-
ed by using a previously described partial R-domain deleted CFTR (CFTRΔR) (33).
Lentiviral vectors are promising candidates for CF gene therapy because they can persistently express 
a transgene of interest in the lung and potentially be readministered without immune suppression (34, 35). 
Lentiviral vectors evaluated for CF gene therapy include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and FIV
, as well as equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) (12, 34, 36–39). 
Typically, retroviral and lentiviral vectors are pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), but its 
preference for basolateral entry requires disruption of the tight junctions for efficient transduction (40–42). 
Alternate pseudotyping envelope proteins that confer tropism to the airway include baculovirus GP64 (24), 
influenza hemagglutinin (HA) (39), and the Sendai F and HN proteins (38). Lentiviruses pseudotyped with 
these envelope glycoproteins efficiently transduce airway epithelia in vivo and persist through the lifetime 
of a mouse. Integrating vectors that transduce airway epithelial cells and express long-term are favorable 
candidates to achieve efficient and persistent phenotypic correction after a single administration.
Progress for CF gene therapy has been hindered in part due to the lack of animal models that share 
similar lung disease phenotypes as humans. Though preclinical CF gene therapy studies show correc-
tion of CFTR anion channel defects both ex vivo and in vivo in mice (43, 44), phenotypic correction 
of animal models that recapitulate human CF lung disease is desirable to evaluate the potential of 
viral vectors as therapeutics. The development of the CF pig and ferret has opened the door to study 
CF disease pathogenesis, perform translational studies, and develop a standard of metrics to quantify 
endpoints for CF gene therapy.
The sinuses are nearly universally involved in CF (45, 46). Sinus disease pathogenesis has been charac-
terized in the CF pig model (22, 47). In well-differentiated primary airway epithelial cultures from CF pig 
sinuses, delivery of CFTR by an adenoviral vector corrects the defective anion transport phenotype, sug-
gesting that the CF pig is a good preclinical model for sinus gene therapy studies (22). In the present studies, 
we show that lentiviral-mediated delivery of CFTR in vivo complements the anion channel defect in sinus 
epithelia and increases the ASL pH of epithelial cells cultured from a FIV-CFTR–treated pig.
We acknowledge that this study has limitations. We emphasize that this is a short-term proof-of-prin-
ciple study that does not assess the ability to treat or prevent disease, and we have not yet tested the 
ability to readminister the vector in pigs (34, 48). However, evidence of partial in vivo CFTR correction 
in this pilot study is encouraging. These findings set the stage for future studies of lentiviral vector gene 
therapy efficacy, persistence, and safety. Goals for future studies will include efforts to increase the 
transduction efficiency (e.g., modify envelope pseudotype and vector production), engineer the trans-
gene cassette, and investigate the feasibility of repeated vector administration. Studies of longer dura-
tion are needed to assess the persistence of gene expression and the ability to target cells with progenitor 
capacity. This study achieved important milestones regarding the feasibility of lentiviral-mediated gene 
therapy for CF.
The CF pig spontaneously develops lung disease similarly to humans with CF, experiencing the devel-
opment of acidic ASL pH, bacterial infections, inflammation, impaired MCT, and airway remodeling (15). 
This allows us to measure CFTR correction in a large-animal model that recapitulates key features of CF in 
humans. Sinus and airway epithelia are easily accessible for vector delivery, and these tissues are anatomi-
cally available for in vivo and ex vivo analysis. Importantly, the endpoints that we developed for this study 
allowed us to identify and quantify CFTR-dependent gene transfer events. Historically, CFTR function has 
been assessed by measuring anion transport. The assays of ASL pH and bacterial killing provide additional 
end points for phenotypic correction. Future directions will also focus on safety. Study goals include the 
measurement of innate and adaptive immune responses to vector application and transgene expression, 
the development of neutralizing antibodies, mapping of integration sites, and dose-escalation studies. This 
study and a companion study by Steines and colleagues using AAV to deliver CFTR to CF pigs are the 
first gene therapy studies to our knowledge to quantify anion transport, ASL pH, and bacterial killing in a 
large-animal CF model.

Methods
Pigs. CF pigs were generated by homologous recombination in fibroblasts as previously described (49). 
Gut-corrected CF pigs were generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning (19). These CF pigs were 
housed at the University of Iowa throughout the study. For viral vector delivery, newborn pigs were anes-
thetized using 2% isofluorane while oxygen levels, pulse, and respiratory rate were monitored. For the 
bacterial killing assay, pigs were i.m. anesthetized with ketamine (20 mg/kg) and xylazine (both Akorn 
Animal Health; 2 mg/kg), and anesthesia was maintained with propofol (Fresenius Kabi USA;1 mg/kg) 
i.v. Animals were euthanized via i.v. Euthasol (Virbac AH Inc.; 90 mg/kg) after pH and bacterial killing 
were measured.
Vector production. The FIV vector used in this study was produced by the Indiana University Vector 
Production Facility in collaboration with the NHLBI Gene Therapy Resource Program. FIV expressed a 
codon-optimized porcine CFTR cDNA (accession no. KT184306) under control of the respiratory syncy-
tial virus (RSV) promoter, and viral vector particles were pseudotyped with the baculovirus Autographa cal-
ifornica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus GP64 envelope by transient transfection as described previously 
(50). Virus was concentrated 250-fold for in vitro studies and 1,000-fold for in vivo studies by overnight 
centrifugation at 9,000 g and resuspended in α-lactose buffer. Virus was titered by real-time PCR by the 
University of Iowa Viral Vector Core (51) (www.medicine.uiowa.edu/vectorcore).
Primary cultures of  airway epithelia. Airway epithelial cells from CF pigs were isolated by enzymatic 
digestion, seeded onto semipermeable filters, and grown at the air-liquid interface as previously described 
(52). Cultures were maintained in media supplemented with Ultro-ser G (USG) and the following antibi-
otics: penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/μl), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), fluconazole (2 μg/ml), and 
amphotericin B (1.25 μg/ml). To transduce cells in vitro, FIV-CFTR concentrated lentiviral vector superna-
tants were applied to the apical surface of cultured primary airway epithelia overnight.
In vivo viral vector administration. FIV-CFTR was concentrated 1,000-fold, and 1.5 ml of vector was 
mixed at a 1:1 ratio with 2% methylcellulose (Methocel A4C; Dow Chemical Company) (24). Vector (1 ml) 
was delivered to nasal passageways by a bolus dose using a 24G Jelco catheter (Smiths Medical). For intra-
tracheal delivery, a MADgic atomizer (LMA) was passed through the vocal cords under direct observation, 
and 2 ml of vector formulated with 1% methylcellulose was instilled.
Electrophysiology of  CFTR anion channel. CFTR correction was measured in Ussing chambers. Well-dif-
ferentiated primary cultures or tissue explants were mounted into Ussing chambers (53). The apical and 
basolateral chambers were bathed in symmetrical Ringers solution (135 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES, 0.6 
mM KH2PO4, 2.4 mM K2HPO4, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM Dextrose). CFTR Cl– current was 
measured using a previously described protocol (53). After baseline transepithelial currents were measured, 
Amiloride (Sigma Aldrich) (100 μM) was used to inhibit Na+ channels, followed by 4,4’-Dilsothiocya-
no-2,2’-stilbenedifulonic acid (DIDS) (Sigma Aldrich) (100 μM) to inhibit calcium-activated Cl– channels. 
Once current stabilized, we replaced the apical solution with a low Cl– solution as previously described 
(54). We next applied the cAMP agonists Forskolin (Cayman Chemical) (10 μM) and 3-isobutyl-1-meth-
ylxanthine (IBMX) (Sigma Aldrich) (100 μM). After the current stabilized, GlyH-101 was added to block 
CFTR-mediated Cl– current. Transepithelial voltage (Vt) was maintained at 0 to measure transepithelial 
current (I) and maintained under the voltage clamp.
Localization of  CFTR. Primary airway epithelia were fixed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin (Leica 
Biosystems), paraffin embedded, and sectioned vertically. CFTR IHC was performed using mouse anti-CF-
TR monoclonal antibody (769, CFFT) as previously described (55).
qPCR. CFTR mRNA abundance was quantified by qPCR using SYBR green (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Total RNA was collected from freshly excised tissue using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep protocol (Zymo 
Research) and reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied 
Biosystems). Primer sequences: codon-optimized pig CFTR: Forward: 5′-ACAGGTTCAGCAAAGA-
CATCG-3′, Reverse: 5′- CAGTGGCGAGGAAGATGTAAG-3′. RPL4 was used as a housekeeping gene: 
Forward: 5′- AGCGCTGGTCATGTCTAAAG-3′, Reverse: 5′- TTCCAGGCCTTAAGCTTCTTC-3′. 
Cycle conditions: 48°C for 30 min; 95°C for 10 min; 40 × 95°C for 15 sec, and 60°C for 1 min.
pH and bacterial killing assays. Tracheal ASL pH was measured by placing a noninvasive dual lifetime 
referencing planar optode, a pH-sensitive foil, directly onto the tracheal surface as previously described (16, 
25). Bacterial killing assays were performed as previously described (16). As reported in these studies, S. 
aureus isolate SA43 was cultured to log-phase growth and conjugated to gold electron microscopy grids,

which were coated with streptavidin and biotin. Bacterial-coated grids were then placed on the airway 
surface for 1 minute, rinsed with PBS, and immersed in SYTO9 and propidium iodide (Invitrogen) to 
determine bacterial viability (Live/Dead Bacterial Viability Assay, Invitrogen). Grids were analyzed via 
confocal microscopy and quantified by Image J.
Statistics. Statistically significant differences were calculated as indicated using one-way ANOVA com-
parison or Mann-Whitney nonparametric t test (Graphpad Prism). All data are presented as mean and 
±SEM. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Study approval. All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the University of Iowa IACUC, 
Iowa City, Iowa and in accordance with the United States Department of Agriculture and National Insti-
tutes of Health guidelines.
