We describe the earliest evidence for neoplastic disease in the hominin lineage. This is reported 
from the type specimen of the extinct hominin Australopithecus sediba from Malapa, South Africa, 
dated to 1.98 million years ago. The affected individual was male and developmentally equivalent 
to a human child of 12 to 13 years of age. A penetrating lytic lesion affected the sixth thoracic 
vertebra. The lesion was macroscopically evaluated and internally imaged through phase-contrast 
X-ray synchrotron microtomography. A comprehensive differential diagnosis was undertaken 
based on gross- and micro-morphology of the lesion, leading to a probable diagnosis of osteoid 
osteoma. These neoplasms are solitary, benign, osteoid and bone-forming tumours, formed from 
well-vascularised connective tissue within which there is active production of osteoid and woven 
bone. Tumours of any kind are rare in archaeological populations, and are all but unknown in 
the hominin record, highlighting the importance of this discovery. The presence of this disease 
at Malapa predates the earliest evidence of malignant neoplasia in the hominin fossil record by 
perhaps 200 000 years.
Introduction
A neoplasm (‘new-growth’ or tumour) is defined as a mass of localised tissue growth, the cellular 
proliferation of which is no longer subject to the effects of normal growth-regulating mechanisms.1-3 
A neoplasm may be benign or malignant. Malignant tumours are often referred to colloquially as cancer, 
although the term ‘malignant neoplasia’ is more clinically appropriate.1 In the developed world, death from 
malignancy is second only to cardiovascular disease and is often perceived as a disease of modernity.4 
Neoplastic disease would have been prevalent in the past (e.g. Odes et al.5), but most likely occurred 
at much lower levels of incidence than today, given the shorter life expectancy for victims1,6,7 and the 
differing environmental context. Both these factors strongly influence the incidence and prognosis of any 
cancer.3,8 The preserved signatures of neoplasms of any kind are rare in archaeological populations, and 
are all but unknown in the hominin record. Here we present the earliest fossil evidence for neoplastic 
disease in the human lineage, with a detailed description and diagnosis of a tumorous lesion affecting 
the spine of a juvenile male Australopithecus sediba, Malapa Hominin 1 (MH1).9,10 This species has been 
postulated as a possible ancestor of the genus Homo.9 The clinical and evolutionary implications of the 
diagnosed condition are discussed. 
The Malapa hominin site
The Malapa site is one of several hominin-bearing Plio-Pleistocene cave deposits located within the 
Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site to the northwest of Johannesburg, South Africa. The region 
includes sites such as Sterkfontein11, Swartkrans12, Kromdraai13, Gladysvale14 and Rising Star15. The 
fossil deposits in these caves were formed in roughly similar fashion as debris cone accumulations 
deposited beneath vertical cave openings, which formed phreatically within the dolomites of the Malmani 
Subgroup.15,16 At Malapa, the main hominin-bearing deposits have been dated using uranium-lead dating 
of flowstones, combined with palaeomagnetic and stratigraphic analyses of flowstones and underlying 
sediments, to 1.977 ± 0.002 million years ago (Ma).17 The cave deposits comprise five sedimentary 
facies, termed A to E, from stratigraphically lowest to highest. 
Facies A and B occur below a central flowstone sheet, and are overlain by an erosion remnant (facies C), 
which in turn is overlain by the main hominin-bearing breccia, facies D. This has yielded well-preserved 
macro- and micro-mammal fossils (such as carnivores, equids and bovids18), including the fossilised 
remains of at least six hominins. Two of these, MH1 and MH2, have been reported in the literature as 
representatives of a new hominin species, Australopithecus sediba9. Taphonomically the site has been 
interpreted as a complex cave system with open deep vertical shafts that operated as death traps for animals 
on the surface of the landscape. This death-trap scenario might have been the process by which the Malapa 
hominins entered the cave system17,18, as evidenced by peri-mortem damage on the skeletons of MH1 
and MH2, consistent with a fatal fall19. Furthermore, both skeletons present partial anatomical articulation 
consistent with rapid incorporation into the cave sediments early in the decomposition process.18 
Case study: Vertebra U.W. 88-37
A pathological lesion affects the spine of Malapa Hominin 1 (MH1), the type specimen of 
Australopithecus sediba. This individual (Figure 1) was male, and at death he was at a developmental 
stage equivalent to that of a human child aged 12 to 13 years9. The pathological specimen (U.W. 88-37) 
is a complete vertebra originally assigned to T5-T710, now considered to represent the sixth thoracic 
vertebra10. The dorsal surface of the right-side lamina exhibits a rounded penetrating defect (Figure 2), 
measuring approximately 6.7 mm supero-inferiorly and 5.9 mm medio-laterally.

The defect presents as a lytic lesion that extends ventrally into the 
lamina for much of its length, the most anterior portion of which remains 
infilled with breccia matrix (Figure 3). On the surface, the lesion has 
well-rounded edges with a somewhat sclerotic appearance. There is no 
evidence of periosteal or reactive bone formation on the cortex of the 
specimen. Viewing the right lamina from above, it appears thicker than 
the left lamina and bulges laterally over the lesion, indicating a reactive 
remodelling response to the presence of the defect.

The lesion initially widens directly under the oval opening, but then 
narrows as it progresses anteriorly. The base of the lesion appears 
smooth and sclerotic under microscopic evaluation insofar as the 
presence of residual breccia allows. The spinous process deviates 
slightly to the right, but appears in keeping with slight asymmetry 
noted elsewhere in the surviving thoracic vertebrae. This deviation falls 
within normal variation; we do not consider it significant enough to 
cause scoliosis or other vertebral misalignment, and it is unlikely that 
this asymmetry was related to the pathology.

Because of the presence of breccia within the lesion, the internal 
morphology of the specimen was assessed using phase-contrast 
X-ray synchrotron microtomography (performed at the European 
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, ESRF) and a specific acquisition 
protocol applied for high-quality imaging of large fossils (see 
Supplementary Appendix materials and methods). From the 
microtomographic volume, the maximum long axis of the lesion in 
the transverse plane measures 11.8 mm x 4.9 mm along the minor 
axis, with a cross-sectional area of 45.6 mm, and in the sagittal 
plane the lesion measures 14.7 mm x 7.9 mm, with a cross-sectional 
area of 68.6 mm. The internal linear dimensions are consistently 
less than 20 mm in diameter, which has important implications for 
final diagnosis.

Figure 4 shows the microtomographic imaging, with a semi-trans-
parent volume-rendered image row. The imaging indicates that the 
lesion is highly penetrative and extends ventrally within the right-side 
of the spinous process, penetrating the lamina before terminating 
at the approximate level of the superior articular facet. The internal 
morphology shows no involvement of the transverse process or 
pedicle, and the lesion does not penetrate the vertebral canal. No 
mineralised focal point or nidus was discerned. The edges of the first 
two-thirds of the lesion (moving dorsal to ventral) display sclerotic 
characteristics, with circumscribed margins of well-integrated 
cortical bone, abutted and intersected by trabecular striae (Figure 5 
and Supplementary Appendix). This pattern is indicative of a slow-
forming bony process, with remodelling and reorganisation of 
posterior aspects of the lesion. The shape of a lesion is indicative of 
its growth rate, with lesions that are long and oriented with the long 
axis of a bone indicating a nonaggressive benign process. The ventral 
third of the lesion, however, displays a geographic pattern of bone 
destruction, showing a sharp non-sclerotic margin and evidence 
of active osteolytic processes, with sharply-defined transection 
of individual trabeculae, and active osteolytic penetration into the 
anterior portion of the lamina. A volume-rendered negative surface 
model of the lesion (Figure 6) demonstrates the clear distinction 
between the dorsal sclerotic zone and the ventral lytic zone within the 
body of the active lesion.

Differential diagnosis
Diagnosis was undertaken using palaeopathological and clinical 
diagnostic criteria1,2,20-34. The accumulated evidence for osteolytic and 
osteosclerotic processes indicates that the disease process was both 
chronic and active at the time of death of MH1 (as mentioned, at a 
developmentally equivalent stage to a modern human child of 12 to 13 
years of age). The lesion was less than 15 mm at the largest diameter, 
extending deep into the right side of the spinous process and involving 
only the vertebral lamina. The presence of reorganised sclerotic bone 
indicates a reactive ante-mortem process, and the lesion can therefore 
not be attributed to taphonomic, diagenetic or pathology-mimicking 
effects or processes1. 
The morphology of the lesion externally and internally is inconsistent with 
vertebral osteomyelitis. The absence of a proliferative cortical inflammatory 
response (such as periosteal and/or endosteal bone hypertrophy) or 
secondary lytic lesions across both the U.W. 88-37 vertebra and the 
surviving cranial and post-cranial elements of MH1 excludes a diagnosis 
of specific or non-specific systemic infection, such as brucellosis, non-
specific osteitis, haematogenous osteomyelitis or treponemal osteitis. 
There is no evidence of deformation or callus formation associated with 
skeletal trauma such as a healed fracture, and the lesion does not present 
morphology consistent with post-traumatic processes such as cortical 
hypertrophy or the development of a cloaca. It is therefore most likely 
that this condition represents a primary osteogenic or osseous tumour 
of the spine. These are rare lesions with a much lower incidence than 
metastases, multiple myeloma or lymphoma.1,2,20,21,23,27,32 Based on age 
at death, sex, anatomical location of the lesion, and specific patterns of 
expression and skeletal involvement, conditions such as osteosarcoma, 
chondrosarcoma or Ewing’s sarcoma can be excluded; these neoplasms 
are often more aggressive, with destruction of the cortex1,21,23. 
Included in the differential diagnosis as the most likely cause of 
the observed lesion are osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, giant 
cell tumour and aneurysmal bone cyst. A number of secondary 
diagnoses are possible, specifically enostosis (compact bone island), 
fibrous cortical defect (fibroxanthoma), plasmacytoma, eosinophilic 
granuloma, and hydatid cyst infection. The range of possible differential 
diagnoses and primary diagnostic criteria are detailed in Table S1 
(Supplementary Appendix).
Based on the observed pathological, morphological, and life-history 
criteria, the two most likely diagnoses are osteoid osteoma and 
osteoblastoma. Taking the demographic data for these two tumour 
types into account, both options seem possible: both are primary bone-
forming tumours, osteoblastic in nature; benign; have a predilection for 
males; and show the highest prevalence in juveniles and adolescents. 
Osteoid osteoma resembles the observed lesion in terms of size, as 
these tumours are usually less than 20 mm in diameter, with well-
circumscribed margins and being round or oval in form23. 
McCall22 notes that computed tomography is the most valuable method 
to investigate this type of lesion. Under CT imaging of osteoid osteoma 
a small lucency is often recorded, which may have a central high 
attenuation as a result of mineralisation, and surrounding sclerotic bone 
is noted with some thickening of the lamina or pedicle. These are features 
seen in MH1 (Figure 4). On plain radiographs, most osteoid osteomas 
are osteosclerotic, with or without a visible nidus. By contrast, Kan and 
Schmidt35 suggest that osteoblastomas are predominantly lucent or 
lytic in roughly 50% of cases, sclerotic in 30% of cases, and mixed in 
the remaining 20% of cases. On plain radiographs, osteoblastomas are 
typically expansile with a scalloped or lobulated appearance, and their 
margins are well-defined, with a sclerotic rim evident in approximately 
30% of patients. A sclerotic rim is therefore much more common in 
osteoid osteomas than in osteoblastomas. The smooth, sclerotic, well-
defined posterior margins of the lesion we studied are fully consistent 
with a resolving osteoid osteoma. However, the skeletal distribution 
of osteoid osteoma might argue against this being the most likely 
diagnosis, as osteoid osteomas are most commonly found in the lower 
extremities; occurrence in the spine is less likely than that exhibited 
in osteoblastoma22. 
To quantifiably assess the differential diagnosis, we applied Bayes 
Theorem of conditional probability to the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma 
and osteoblastoma. Using absolute clinical incidence data of osteoid 
osteoma36-38 and osteoblastoma25,37-42 to calculate prior and conditional 
probabilities of the disease expression in the vertebral column (as 
opposed to elsewhere in the skeleton), a conditional probability of 
0.214 was derived for the likelihood of osteoid osteoma, and 0.068 
for osteoblastoma. These results indicate a 3.75-fold higher likelihood 
that osteoid osteoma was represented in this case than osteoblastoma 
(see supplementary online material Table S2 for discussion of Bayes 
parameters and probability functions used). Given the morphological 
and pathological similarities between the two tumour types, and the 
age and nature of the specimen under analysis, the results suggest 
osteoid osteoma firstly and osteoblastoma secondly as the most likely 
diagnoses of what was clearly a benign entity of abnormal nature.

Discussion
MH1 suffered from a primary osteogenic tumour, which affected the 
right lamina of the sixth thoracic vertebra. The neoplastic lesion was 
chronic and was still active at the time of his death. From modern 
clinical studies36-38 it is likely that osteoid osteoma may have taken 
months, rather than years, to develop. This neoplastic condition may 
involve neurological deficits, although this is unlikely as the lesion did 
not penetrate the neural canal, and no scoliosis was noted. However, the 
position of the lesion may have affected normal musculoskeletal function 
and movement of both the shoulder-blade and the upper right quadrant 
of the back. The tumour may have invoked a number of physiological 
responses including acute or chronic pain, muscular disturbance 
and pain-provoked muscular spasm, as discussed in clinical case 
studies.21,36-38,40 A close association exists between the affected region 
and overlaying or closely inserting muscles such as trapezius, erector 
spinae, and rhomboid major, and this might have led to limitations on 
normal movement, given the likely arboreal component in the locomotor 
repertoire of A. sediba.9,43
The presence of a primary bone-forming tumour of the spine presents 
a number of considerations with regard to both the life-history of 
Australopithecus sediba, and evidence for neoplasia elsewhere in the 
deep past. Evidence for neoplastic disease is not unknown in the fossil, 
archaeological and historical records1,8,44. However, preservational 
factors limit the study of neoplasms to the skeleton (with the rare 
exception of naturally and artificially mummified bodies that may 
preserve pathological soft tissues) from which the confident diagnosis 
of tumours has been problematical45. The earliest skeletal evidence for 
neoplastic disease comes from pre-Cenozoic contexts, with purported 
cases of neoplasm found in fossil fish from the Upper Devonian. The 
earliest unequivocal case dates from 300 Ma, with evidence of benign 
osteoma with focal hyperostosis affecting the skeleton of Phanerosteon 
mirabile from the North American Lower Carboniferous3. Later terrestrial 
cases include diagnoses of benign haemangioma and eosinophilic 
granuloma in Jurassic dinosaurs; benign osteoma in mosasaurs; 
and haemangioma, metastatic cancer, desmoplastic fibroma and 
osteoblastoma in Cretaceous hadrosaurs.46,47 In the more recent past, 
benign osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma have been identified in 
European mammoths dating from 24 000 to 23 000 years ago (ka).48 
The presence of neoplastic disease in the hominin fossil record is highly 
contentious. Until recently, the earliest purported evidence was suggested 
to be from a mandible of archaic Homo from Kanam, Kenya. This fossil 
is generally thought to derive from the Lower or Middle Pleistocene, and 
expresses pathological growth in the symphysial region. The lesion has 
been attributed to osteosarcoma, bone keloid, or Burkitt’s lymphoma, 
although some researchers have diagnosed it as osteomyelitis resulting 
from a facial fracture49-52. The first substantive evidence for malignant 
neoplasia in hominins is derived from the SK7923 metatarsal fragment, 
dated to 1.8 to 1.6 Ma, from the site of Swartkrans, South Africa; a bony 
cortical exostosis together with osseous infilling of the medullary cavity 
of the shaft of the bone has been attributed by Odes and colleagues to 
osteosarcoma5.
The next significant evidence for near-human neoplastic disease is 
suggested by Monge and colleagues, who present a case of fibrous 
dysplasia in a rib of Homo neanderthalensis dated to 120 ka from the 
European site of Krapina.53 The Middle Pleistocene site of Atapuerca 
(Sima de los Huesos) evidenced small benign osteoid osteomata 
affecting the orbital roof of crania AT-777 and the endocranial surface 
of Cranium 4.54 Other evidence comes from the Vogelherd (Stetten) II 
parietal bone, initially thought to represent a 35-ka-old Neanderthal, 
but now known to be Neolithic in origin55; in this specimen new bone 
formation has been linked to a possible meningioma although the 
final diagnosis remains equivocal56. The most significant evidence for 
neoplastic disease in antiquity derives from the bio-archaeological 
record of the recent Holocene (and the last four millennia in particular) 
and is detailed in a number of historical reviews and texts1-3,46 to which 
the reader is directed. 
As noted above, neoplastic disease in various forms, including osteoid 
osteoma and osteoblastoma, is an ancient phenomenon. It first appeared 
during the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic in extinct fish and members of the 
Dinosauria respectively.3,46,47 However, the fact that reports of cancers 
or neoplasms remain exceedingly rare in the fossil record of almost 
any geological epoch1,3,8,46,47,53 may be due to a number of factors, 
exacerbated by the relative disjunction between osseous tumours and 
all other forms of neoplasms. Primary bone tumours are rare compared 
with other neoplasms and account for around 7% of all soft and hard 
tissue cancers.22 Neoplasms are historically reported to be rare in wild 
living mammals, with only 1.8% of deaths in chimpanzee communities 
reportedly resulting from cancer.3 A mere handful of neoplastic cases 
have been recorded based on observational studies of camels, deer, 
gibbons, tigers, kangaroos, pacaranas, fur seals, ferrets, killer whales, 
harbour seals, sea lions and harp seals.3 However, recent reviews of 
neoplasms in wild non-human primates57 have shown that neoplastic 
disease might be far more widespread than previous studies suggest, 
in both monkeys and great apes; however, the vast majority of such 
cases involve benign soft tissue rather than malignant tumours. When 
bone tumours have been noted, they have tended to present as small 
benign growths such as button osteomata, which have been observed in 
both gorilla subspecies but have not been seen in either chimpanzees or 
orangutans57. An isolated case of benign osteochondroma was observed 
in the Gombe chimpanzee ‘Old Female’.58 Whilst these rare cases of 
neoplasia in non-human primates share morphological homology with 
human disease expression, it is unclear whether they share a common 
genetic basis or evolutionary history. 
With regard to osteoid osteoma in humans, cytogenetic chromoso-
mal studies indicate some degree of a genetic basis. This includes 
the involvement of chromosome 22, 22q monosomy and trisomy 
aberrations59; aberrant expression of transcription factors Runx2 and 
Osterix, both of which are master regulators of osteoblastic lineage 
differentiation60; and duplications and deletions at 22q13.159, the 
locus of which reflects genes that play a role directly in osteogenesis 
(PDGF-B and ATF-4). The involvement of the latter suite of genes may 
suggest a degree of evolutionary conservatism, which warrants further 
investigation across primate taxa. As noted by Odes et al.5, whilst the 
expression of neoplasia is rare in prehistory, the capacity for neoplastic 
disease (as evidenced by both fossil evidence and oncogenes) was 
present in deep-time. 
It is no surprise that metastatic bone tumours are rare or absent in the 
archaeological and fossil records, because of the limited life expectancies 
of our ancestors6,7 and the low incidence generally of skeletally forming or 
affecting neoplasms1,3,20,23,46. It is well known that primary bone tumours 
mostly occur in younger individuals1,20,21,27,37,40, and it can therefore 
be expected that such tumours would have been present and have a 
similar prevalence to what is observed among modern individuals. It 
seems likely that neoplastic disease was as prevalent in ancient hominin 
populations as that expressed today in wild primate groups, but for 
various reasons it left little fossil trace. One reason might be the sheer 
paucity of individuals recovered from the hominin record, which would 
represent an issue of epidemiological sampling6. 
With regard to the earliest evidence for neoplastic disease in the hominin 
fossil record reported here, the fact that primary bone neoplasms 
are so rare makes this an important discovery. Whilst we consider it 
unlikely that neoplastic disease would have played a major role in the 
evolutionary forces operating on the Homininae, this case provides 
a unique glimpse into the individual life experience of a single extinct 
hominin. MH1 provides a window onto the expression and evolution 
of neoplastic disease in the human lineage, and highlights the utility 
of multidisciplinary clinical studies applied to the understanding of the 
evolution and development of disease in the human lineage.
