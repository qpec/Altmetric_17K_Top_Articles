Impaired wound closure is a growing medical problem associated
with metabolic diseases and aging. Immune cells play important
roles in wound healing by following instructions from the microen-
vironment. Here, we developed a technology to bioengineer the
wound microenvironment and enhance healing abilities of the
immune cells. This resulted in strongly accelerated wound healing
and was achieved by transforming Lactobacilli with a plasmid
encoding CXCL12. CXCL12-delivering bacteria administrated topi-
cally to wounds in mice efficiently enhanced wound closure by
increasing proliferation of dermal cells and macrophages, and led to
increased TGF-β expression in macrophages. Bacteria-produced lac-
tic acid reduced the local pH, which inhibited the peptidase CD26
and consequently enhanced the availability of bioactive CXCL12.
Importantly, treatment with CXCL12-delivering Lactobacilli also im-
proved wound closure in mice with hyperglycemia or peripheral
ischemia, conditions associated with chronic wounds, and in a hu-
man skin wound model. Further, initial safety studies demonstrated
that the topically applied transformed bacteria exerted effects re-
stricted to the wound, as neither bacteria nor the chemokine pro-
duced could be detected in systemic circulation. Development of
drugs accelerating wound healing is limited by the proteolytic na-
ture of wounds. Our technology overcomes this by on-site chemo-
kine production and reduced degradation, which together ensure
prolonged chemokine bioavailability that instructed local immune
cells and enhanced wound healing.

A
n open wound in the skin can cause severe discomfort and
provide an entry for invading bacteria. During the inflam-
mation phase of wound healing, immune cells accumulate in re-
sponse to alarm signals, cytokines, and chemokines released by
injured or activated cells (1–5). The chemokine CXCL12 (Stromal
cell-Derived Factor 1α) is associated with beneficial effects in
models of cutaneous wounds (6, 7) and binds CXCR4 expressed by
immune cells and keratinocytes (8). Macrophages and neutrophils
represent the major immune cell populations at the wound site,
where they are essential for keeping invading microorganisms at
bay and also for fueling the healing process by secreting additional
chemokines, growth factors, and matrix digesting enzymes. During
the course of healing, macrophages shift phenotype toward an
anti-inflammatory one and subsequently promote tissue restitu-
tion. This shift is induced by macrophage phagocytosis of cell
debris and by microenvironmental signals (9) such as CXCL12 (10,
11). Immune suppression therapies (12) and experimental immune
cell depletion (13, 14) delay wound healing, revealing a pivotal
immune cell involvement.
Chronic wounds are often associated with underlying patho-
logic processes that increase susceptibility for acquiring wounds
(e.g., peripheral neuropathies) and/or reduced healing abilities
as seen in persons with arterial or venous insufficiencies or
diabetes or who are receiving systemic steroid-treatment (15,
16). Standard care for chronic ulcers comprises surgical or
chemical removal of necrotic tissue, repeated dressing changes,
and antibiotics to fight infections (17). Several experimental and
clinical trials have investigated the effects of local application of
growth factors alone or coupled to different biomaterials on
different types of chronic wounds, but with modest results so far
(18). The poor translational success is at least in part a result of
the proteolytic nature of the wound, limiting drug bioavailability,
and highlights the importance of addressing clinical feasibility
and read-out when designing the delivery system.
This study aimed to accelerate wound healing by targeting the
function of immune cells through local bioengineering of the
wound microenvironment. To achieve this, a technology optimized
to deliver chemokines directly to wounded skin was developed,
whereby lactic acid bacteria were used as vectors. Lactobacillus
reuteri bacteria were transformed with a plasmid encoding the
chemokine CXCL12 previously associated with beneficial effects
in models of healing (6, 7) and blood-flow restoration (19, 20).
Significance
Chronic wounds comprise a growing clinical problem that
represents >3% of the health care budget in industrialized
countries. Drug development is hampered by the proteolytic
nature of the wounds, which greatly limits drug bioavailability.
Here, we present a technology that circumvents this by on-site
production and reduced chemokine degradation. Lactobacilli
bacteria were transformed into CXCL12-producing vectors to
bioengineer the wound microenvironment after topical appli-
cation. Consequently, the immune cells driving the healing
process were reinforced, which greatly accelerated wound
closure in healthy mice, in mouse models of hyperglycemia and
peripheral ischemia, and in a wound model using human skin
disks. Initial safety studies demonstrated that neither bacteria
nor the chemokine produced was detected in systemic circu-
lation following application to open wounds.

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 Bacteria-produced lactic acid reduced the pH in the wound and
thereby potentiated the effects of the produced CXCL12 by pro-
longing its bioavailability. The overall result of topical wound
treatment with this on-site chemokine delivery system was strongly
accelerated wound closure to an extent not reported before.
Results
Specific and Efficient Plasmid Expression in Transformed L. reuteri.
Bacterial production and secretion of CXCL12 following trans-
formation with pSIP_CXCL12 depended completely on addition of
the promoter induction peptide [induced CXCL12-producing
Lactobacilli (LB_CXCL12); Fig. S1B], and no CXCL12 was de-
tected in the supernatant from noninduced bacteria or bacteria
carrying the luciferase plasmids (pSIP_Luc, LB_Luc). Addition of
the activation peptide to LB_Luc resulted in immediate luciferase
expression that peaked during the first 2 h and lasted for >10 h
(Fig. S1C). Following topical application to cutaneous wounds in
mice, the bacteria were restricted to the wound surface and
plasmid expression was high for the first 1 h (Fig. 1 A and B).
Treatment of wounds with CXCL12-producing L. reuteri resulted
in increased CXCL12 levels in adjacent skin 2 d after wound in-
duction independent of bacterial dose (Fig. 1 C–G), indicating
that bacterial adhesion to the wound is a dose-limiting factor.
CXCL12-Producing L. reuteri Accelerates Wound Healing. Daily admin-
istration of CXCL12-producing L. reuteri (2 × 107 cfu) to wounds
resulted in accelerated wound closure compared with untreated
wounds or wounds treated with control L. reuteri, in which the effect
was most prominent during the first 24 h (Fig. 2 A and B) and
wound area over time (area under the curve) was reduced (Fig.
2C). The time to complete or partial wound closure was reduced
for wounds treated with CXCL12-producing L. reuteri compared
with untreated wounds or wounds treated with control L. reuteri
(Fig. 2D and Fig. S2 A–C). No additional effect on wound
healing was demonstrated by increasing the dose of CXCL12-
producing L. reuteri (Fig. S2 D and E), which agrees with mea-
sured levels of bacteria-delivered CXCL12 (Fig. 1 D–G). CXCL12
delivered by a different bacterial strain, Lactococcus lactis, also
accelerated wound healing (Fig. S2 F and G).
On-Site Production of CXCL12 and Lactic Acid Increases Bioavailability.
When fresh supernatants from CXCL12-producing L. reuteri or
different concentrations of recombinant CXCL12 (rCXCL12) were
applied topically to wounds once daily, wound closure was not
accelerated (Fig. 3 A and B). However, rCXCL12 (0.2 μg) given
every 10th minute for 1 h once daily to mimic continuous delivery
accelerated wound closure (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that sus-
tained CXCL12 delivery is needed to promote wound healing.
CXCL12 is processed at the NH2 terminus to an inactive form
[CXCL12(3-68)] by membrane-bound CD26 (dipeptidylpeptidase
IV) expressed in wounds (21–23). The activity of CD26 is pH-
dependent (24, 25), and enzymatic activity of CD26 was higher
at pH 8.3 than pH 7.3, as described before, whereas there was no
enzymatic activity at pH 6.3 or pH 5.3 (Fig. S3 A–D). Conse-
quently, CXCL12 was totally inactivated by CD26 at pH 8.3 within
30 min and inactivated to a partial extent at pH 7.3. In contrast,
CXCL12 was not processed at pH 6.3 and pH 5.3 (Fig. 3C). Lactic
acid produced by L. lactis and L. reuteri causes a decrease in pH of
0.2–0.5 over the cultured period despite strain-specific differences
in growth (Fig. S3 E–H). To investigate if pH-dependent degra-
dation of CXCL12 within the wound affects healing, rCXCL12
(0.2 μg) was administered in buffers with different pH (pH 7.35,
pH 6.35, pH 5.35). Intriguingly, only at pH 6.35 did CXCL12 in-
duce rapid wound closure (Fig. 3 D and E). These data provide
evidence that concomitant lactic acid production by the bacteria
enhance bioavailability of the delivered chemokine.
CXCL12 Induces Proliferation and Increases Macrophage-Produced
TGF-β and CXCL12. Wound induction increased the number of
proliferating cells in the dermis and epidermis at the wound edge
at 24 h, in addition to increased density of macrophages and
TGF-β–expressing macrophages (Table S1). When wounds were
treated with CXCL12-producing L. reuteri, the number of pro-
liferating cells increased further (Fig. 4 A and B and Fig. S4A), as
did the levels of TGF-β in the dermis closest to the wound and
the number of wound-associated macrophages (Fig. 4 C and D
and Fig. S4B), of which an increased fraction expressed TGF-β
(Fig. 4E). Approximately 50% of the TGF-β+ macrophages
within wounds expressed the mannose receptor 1 (MMR), a
marker for macrophages involved in tissue remodeling (Fig. 4F).
The wound-associated macrophages also expressed the CXCL12
receptor CXCR4, and the density but not the fraction of
CXCR4+ macrophages were increased by CXCL12-producing
L. reuteri treatment (Fig. 4 G and H and Fig. S4C). Further, the
density and fraction of CXCL12-expressing wound-associated
macrophages increased with treatment of CXCL12-producing
L. reuteri (Fig. 4 I and J and Fig. S4C), demonstrating an auto-
crine feedback previously described (11).
The effect of macrophages in wound healing was elucidated by
depleting mice of macrophages. The protocol used resulted in
impaired wound healing at 48 h (Fig. 4 K and L) and 40% re-
duction of dermis macrophages at the wound. The effect of
CXCL12-expressing L. reuteri on accumulation of wound mac-
rophages and acceleration of healing was abolished (Fig. 4 M and

 N), illustrating the causal correlation between wound macro-
phages and accelerated healing by CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri.
Whereas the density of collagen I or fibronectin in the dermis
closest to the wound remained unaltered (Fig. S4 D–F), CXCL12-
expressing L. reuteri increased the amount of laminin present at
this site (Fig. S4 D and G).
Improved Reepithelialization of Wounded Human Skin Disks. The
effects of CXCL12-producing L. reuteri was tested on healthy
human skin in an in vitro model of wound reepithelialization,
whereby newly formed epidermal sleeves partly cover the ex-
posed dermis in wounded skin disks cultured in 10% FCS me-
dium (positive control) while being barely detectable in disks
cultured in 2% FCS medium (negative control; Fig. 5 A and B).
The cells in the epidermal sleeves expressed keratin (Fig. S5A),
and keratinocytes migrated over the exposed dermis toward the
wound center (Fig. S5B). The length of the epidermal sleeves
(i.e., reepithelialization) was increased after treatment with
L. reuteri expressing human CXCL12 for 14 d (Fig. 5B), and
more keratinocytes in the basal layer within 250 μm from the
wound edge proliferated (Fig. 5C). Few cells were found to
proliferate in the dermis beneath the wounds irrespective of
conditions (Fig. 5D and Fig. S5C). Skin morphology was main-
tained by L. reuteri treatment, and epidermis thickening at the
wound edge, a hallmark of healing tissues, was macroscopically
detected (Fig. 5A). Addition of L. reuteri to the cultured skin
disks lowered the pH of the medium after 24 h (Fig. 5E), which
did not impact sleeve length or epidermal proliferation (Fig. 5 B
and C). Interestingly, MHC II+ cells detected in cultured skin
disks increased in numbers by hCXCL12-expressing L. reuteri
(Fig. 5 F and G), demonstrating macrophage proliferation also in
the wound model of human skin.
Improved Wound Healing During Peripheral Ischemia or Hyperglycemia.
After induction of hind-limb ischemia (a model of peripheral is-
chemia), the cutaneous perfusion was reduced by >50% at the day
of wound induction (Fig. S6A), which resulted in impaired wound
healing and prolonged mean time to complete healing (to 10 d;
Figs. S2C and S6B). Treatment with CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri
again accelerated wound closure compared with untreated or
LB-treated wounds, which was most prominent during the first day
following wound induction (Fig. 6A), resulting in reduced wound
area and faster wound healing (Fig. 6 B and C and Fig. S6 B–D).
Mice that were rendered severely hyperglycemic before wound
induction had altered wound healing and basal skin blood perfusion
(Fig. S6 E and K), and remained hyperglycemic (>16.7 mmol/L)
with maintained body weight during the experiment (Fig. S6 F and
G). In the severely hyperglycemic mice, treatment with L. reuteri-
delivering CXCL12 accelerated wound closure at 2 d after wound
induction (Fig. 6D) but not at later time points (Fig. 6 E and F and
Fig. S6 H–J). In the moderate hyperglycemic model (>11.1 mmol/
L), the wound healing was impaired (Fig. S6L) and mice remained
moderately hyperglycemic during the experiment (Fig. S6 M and
N). In this model, treatment with L. reuteri-delivering CXCL12
accelerated wound closure at day 1 after wound induction (Fig.
6G), but not at later time points (Fig. 6 H and I and Fig. S6 O–Q).
Normalized Wound Blood-Flow Response in Hyperglycemic Mice. Blood
flow at the site of injury is characterized by rapid vasoconstriction
followed by transient hyperemia during the inflammatory phase
(26). In mice, the hyperemic phase seen in the skin around the
wound (0–300 μm) lasted for 3 d (Fig. S7 A and B). The hyperemia
was absent in mice with hind-limb ischemia and also after treat-
ment with control and CXCL12-expressing L. reuteri (Fig. S7 C
and D). In the severely hyperglycemic mice, the basal skin perfu-
sion was reduced already before wound induction (Fig. S6K), and
the wound-induced hyperemia was absent (Fig. S7E). However,
treatment with CXCL12-expressing bacteria in hyperglycemic mice
normalized the blood-flow increase around the wound (Fig. S7F).
Initial Safety and Stability Studies Support Drug Development. No
systemic exposure was detected, as circulating CXCL12 did
not increase with treatment with CXCL12-producing bacteria
(2 × 109 lactobacilli per wound) to open wounds (Fig. 7A) despite
increased dermal CXCL12 close to the wound (Fig. 1 D–G).
Further, no translocation of lactobacilli from wound to circulation
was detected, even with a 100-fold higher dose (blood cultures).

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 Topical application of L. reuteri to wounds did not increase
local inflammation-induced hyperemia; in fact, the hyperemic
phase was abolished by the treatment (Fig. 7B). This indicates
that the inflammatory response of wound induction is reduced by
L. reuteri treatment, and that addition of the bacteria to open
wounds does not cause local inflammation.
To facilitate off-the-shelf use, freeze-dried formulations of
CXCL12-producing bacteria were developed. Following bacte-
rial resuspension and induction, maintained plasmid expression
was detected in vitro (Fig. 7C) and in vivo (Fig. 7D) in wounds,
and maintained biological effect was demonstrated as accelera-
ted wound closure compared with untreated wounds or wounds
treated with control L. reuteri (Fig. 7 E and F). Thus, freeze-dried
formulations demonstrated maintained stability and efficacy on
wound healing and therefore represent an attractive approach
for future pharmaceutical development.
Discussion
The present study demonstrates efficient means to accelerate
cutaneous wound healing through bioengineering of the wound
microenvironment by local overexpression of CXCL12. To
achieve this, a system that generates sustained chemokine delivery
and increases chemokine bioavailability within the wound was
developed by using genetically modified Lactobacillus bacteria
as vectors (described in Fig. S8). Transformed Lactobacillus
expressed and released high levels of CXCL12 for 1 h following
induction and topical administration to cutaneous wounds. In
parallel, these bacteria enhanced chemokine bioavailability by
producing lactic acid, which reduced local pH and thereby pre-
vented CXCL12 degradation. This approach resulted in greatly
accelerated wound healing in a macrophage-dependent manner in
the skin of healthy mice, as well as in mice with reduced skin
perfusion or hyperglycemia. Accelerated wound healing was also
confirmed in a human skin wound model.
Wound healing is a complex biological process, and thera-
peutic enhancement has proven difficult. Patients with large and
chronic wounds rely on removal of necrotic tissue, changes of
wound dressings, and frequent antibiotic therapies to avoid sys-
temic spread of infectious bacteria that colonize the wound (17).
Boosting the signals that stimulate healing within the local mi-
croenvironment has been explored by using topical administra-
tion of certain growth factors and chemokines alone or coupled
to different biomaterials (18, 27–30). In preclinical models, local
overexpression or administration of chemokine-loaded hydrogels
(CXCL12 or CCL2) have been reported to improve wound
healing (18, 28, 30, 31), and CXCR2−/− mice were shown to
exhibit impaired healing (32). Despite promising experimental
effects, clinical translation is hampered at least in part by high
levels of proteolytic enzymes within the wound (33), which limits
protein bioavailability. Inhibition of these proteolytic enzymes
(DPP4/CD26) has yielded interesting results, and improved wound
healing was observed in CD26−/− mice (30). DPP4/CD26 inhibition
is already in clinical use to lower blood glucose levels, and a recent
review reports positive effects of this treatment on healing of di-
abetic foot ulcers (34). Another way to override local protein

 degradation is to deliver protein-producing cells to the wound.
Genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells expressing the che-
mokine CXCL12 have been reported to accelerate cutaneous
wound healing following injection in the wound edge (27). This
approach is excellent for experimental delivery of CXCL12, but
faces significant difficulties when clinical feasibility and regulatory
aspects are taken into account.
The present study uses the probiotic (i.e., health-promoting,
nonpathogenic) bacteria L. reuteri as local protein-producing bio-
reactors, which normally are sparsely present on the skin (35). The
use of lactobacilli as vectors to deliver protein has been reported in
models of colitis, in which IL-10 delivered by Lactobacillus casei
was shown to ameliorate inflammation (36). Further, L. lactis
producing active IL-22 is a promising system as a living vaccine
adjuvant (37). Lactobacilli produce lactic acid and thereby reduce
local pH when applied to wounds. Local pH regulates biological
actions of chemokines by affecting their combination and confor-
mation, but also their degradation by extracellular enzymes (25,
38). The superior effect on wound healing by our genetically
modified Lactobacillus compared with rCXCL12 depended on the
local pH reduction by bacterial lactic acid. The reduced pH in-
creased chemokine bioavailability by preventing peptidase CD26
from cleaving and inactivating CXCL12, as previously shown (11).
Macrophages are key players in wound healing. They dynam-
ically change function throughout the healing process, as they
phagocytose cellular debris, apoptotic cells, and invading organisms,
as well as instruct epithelial and endothelial cells, fibroblasts, stem
cells, and other immune cells by releasing multiple paracrine factors
(14, 39–41). Consequently, macrophage depletion at early stages of
wound healing attenuated epithelialization, granulation tissue for-
mation, and wound contraction (14). TGF-β is a central signaling
molecule in tissue restoration, as it stimulates chemotaxis, wound
contraction, angiogenesis, and deposition of ECM (42). Antiin-
flammatory macrophages fuel tissue restoration by being the main
source of TGF-β (9, 14). In the present study, the most prominent
effect on wound healing by the CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri was
during the first 24 h following wound induction and treatment,
which coincided with increased TGF-β levels in the dermis and
higher numbers of TGF-β+ macrophages. Thus, the observed
accelerated wound closure by bacteria-delivered CXCL12 is at
least partly the result of an amplified repair program by the in-
creased population of TGF-β–producing macrophages, which fur-
ther instruct other cells involved in the wound healing process (14).
Wound healing is a metabolically active process, and sufficient
blood supply is a prerequisite. Basal blood flow and vasomotion
are reduced in limbs in persons with peripheral ischemic diseases
or diabetes, and these conditions are highly associated with de-
velopment of chronic wounds. In the present study, the effect of
the CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri on wound healing was in-
vestigated in models of peripheral ischemic disease and diabetes.
The skin perfusion was demonstrated to be reduced in both of
these models, and treatment with CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri
again accelerated wound closure. Further, the initial hyperemic
response to wound induction was absent in mice with induced
peripheral ischemia or hyperglycemia, but was restored in the
hyperglycemic mice treated with CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri.

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 In summary, we have developed a technology platform of local
CXCL12 delivery and prolonged bioavailability in wounds. With the
use of this approach, bioengineering of the wound microenviron-
ment resulted in reprogramming of wound macrophages into the
restitution phenotype and thereby a unique efficacy on acceleration
of cutaneous wound healing in three different mouse models and
human skin biopsy specimens. The delivery system was confirmed
to be clinically and commercially feasible in preclinical models.
Methods
All experiments were approved by the Uppsala Regional Laboratory Animal
Ethical Committee or the Uppsala Ethical Committee.
Experimental Models.
Wound healing in mice. Full-thickness (i.e., epidermis, dermis, and subcutis)
wounds were induced on the hind limb of anesthetized C57BL/6 mice by using a
sterile punch biopsy needle (5-mm diameter). Wounds were treated daily with 10 μL
saline solution, control L. reuteri, or CXCL12-expressing L. reuteri or L. lactis. Bac-
teria were cultured overnight, reinoculated, and grown to OD 0.5, or resuspended
from a freeze-dried formulation and activated 5 min before application with in-
duction peptide SppIP (10 ng/mL) to wounds. rCXCL12-1a (R&D Systems) 0.2 μg (pH
7.35, pH 6.35, or pH 5.35), 0.6 μg, or 1 μg was administered to wounds once daily.
Reepithelialization assay in human skin biopsy specimens. Wounds were induced in
the center of each 6-mm-diameter skin disk by removing the epidermis and su-
perficial parts of the dermis by using a 3-mm skin biopsy punch and sterile scissors,
and skin disks were cultured in media at 37 °C, 5% carbon dioxide, and 95%
humidity for as long as 14 d. Control or hCXCL12-expressing L. reuteri, 106 bacteria
in 10 μL MRS (De Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar), were administered centrally in
the wounds. At time points 7 d and 14 d, disks were sampled for further analysis.
Reduction of skin perfusion. Hind-limb ischemia was induced in anesthetized
mice by ligation and excision of the femoral artery above the superficial
epigastric artery branch.
Induction of hyperglycemia. Severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose level >16.7 mmol/L)
was induced by a single tail-vein injection of alloxan monohydrate (8 mg/mL,
1 μL/g body weight) dissolved in sterile saline solution. Intermediate hypergly-
cemia (blood glucose level >11.1 mmol/L for two consecutive days) was induced
by i.p. injections of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg for five consecutive days), whereas
control groups were injected with saline solution. Blood glucose and body
weight was monitored throughout the experiment. The mice reached these
blood glucose levels between days 12 and 30.
Statistical Analysis. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Two-way ANOVA
with Bonferroni post hoc test was used to analyze the healing process over
time. For analysis of one time point, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post
hoc test (between more than two groups) or Student’s two-tailed unpaired
t test was used, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
