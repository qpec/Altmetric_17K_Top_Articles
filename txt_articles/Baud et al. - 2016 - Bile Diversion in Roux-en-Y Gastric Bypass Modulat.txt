In Brief
The beneficial metabolic consequences
of bariatric surgery independent of weight
loss remain largely unexplained. Baud
et al. identify sodium as a key factor and
show that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
decreases the amount of sodium
normally brought into the intestine with
bile, thereby impairing intestinal glucose
uptake via sodium-glucose cotransport.

SUMMARY
Gastro-intestinal exclusion by Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass (RYGB) improves glucose metabolism, inde-
pendent of weight loss. Although changes in intesti-
nal bile trafficking have been shown to play a role, the
underlying mechanisms are unclear. We performed
RYGB in minipigs and showed that the intestinal
uptake of ingested glucose is blunted in the bile-
deprived alimentary limb (AL). Glucose uptake in
the AL was restored by the addition of bile, and
this effect was abolished when active glucose intes-
tinal transport was blocked with phlorizin. Sodium-
glucose cotransporter 1 remained expressed in the
AL, while intraluminal sodium content was markedly
decreased. Adding sodium to the AL had the same
effect as bile on glucose uptake. It also increased
postprandial blood glucose response in conscious
minipigs following RYGB. The decrease in intestinal
uptake of glucose after RYGB was confirmed in hu-
mans. Our results demonstrate that bile diversion
affects postprandial glucose metabolism by modu-
lating sodium-glucose intestinal cotransport.
INTRODUCTION
Weight loss surgery is an efficient treatment for obesity and
related metabolic diseases (Sjo
¨ stro
¨ m, 2013). In patients with
type 2 diabetes (T2D), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), which
excludes a portion of the stomach and the proximal intestine
from the alimentary circuit, improves glucose metabolism
more rapidly (Hickey et al., 1998) and to a greater extent
than expected from weight loss alone (Laferre
` re et al., 2008).
RYGB is also more efficient than exclusively restrictive opera-
tions to reverse nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Caiazzo et al.,
2014). These observations suggest that bypassing the foregut
may directly contribute to improved glucose metabolism. One
proposed mechanism is the exaggerated postprandial secre-
tion of GLP-1 and the resulting improvement of beta cell func-
tion (Jørgensen et al., 2013). Some authors have also sug-
gested that RYGB reduces the secretion of diabetogenic
proteins by the duodenum (Rubino et al., 2006; Salinari et al.,
2013) or modulates glucoregulatory nutrient sensing in the
jejunum (Breen et al., 2012). Other studies incriminated glucose
handling by the bile-deprived alimentary limb (AL). The pro-
posed mechanisms include a functional defect in sodium-
glucose intestinal cotransporter (Stearns et al., 2009), an in-
crease in intestinal neoglucogenesis and portal glucose sensing
(Troy et al., 2008), or an increase in enterocyte metabolism and
GLUT1-mediated uptake of circulating glucose (Cavin et al.,
2016; Saeidi et al., 2013). Interestingly, the main metabolic fea-
tures of RYGB can be experimentally reproduced by diverting
bile flux from the hepatic duct directly to the distal intestine
(Kohli et al., 2013; Flynn et al., 2015; Goncalves et al., 2015).
Here, we demonstrated that the exclusion of bile and other
digestive fluids decreases active glucose intestinal uptake by
disturbing the intestinal circulation of endogenous sodium and
hence blunting the sodium microclimate in the AL, resulting in
a decrease in postprandial blood glucose response.
RESULTS
Ingested Glucose Is Absorbed in the Common Limb
After RYGB, ingested food passes directly from a small gastric
pouch to a jejunal segment called the alimentary limb (AL).
Bile travels with other gastrointestinal fluids through the intact
upper duodenojejunal segment, or biliary limb (BL), and only
encounters nutrients in the distal portion of the intestine, or
the common limb (CL). Our first aim was to identify the contribu-
tion of these different intestinal segments on postprandial
glucose homeostasis in a clinically relevant model. Thus, we per-
formed RYGB in adult minipigs (Verhaeghe et al., 2014) and
measured blood glucose, plasma insulin, and GLP-1 concentra-
tions during the progression of a mixed meal (MM) first in the AL
and then in the CL (Figure 1A). Blood glucose concentrations
slightly increased, although not significantly, when the meal
was physically confined to the AL by the intestinal clamp and
reached a steady state between 90 min and 180 min (Figure 1B).
Conversely, blood glucose concentrations rapidly increased

547
 when the clamp was removed and the meal met up with bile and
other digestive fluids in the CL (Figure 1B). Plasma insulin (Fig-
ure 1C) and GLP-1 (Figure 1D) concentrations only increased
when the meal reached the CL, in close association with the in-
crease of blood glucose.
We performed similar experiments to explore the roles of the
proximal and distal portions of the CL in these changes (Fig-
ure 1E). Blood glucose concentrations increased as soon as
the meal passed through the proximal CL (Figure 1F). Plasma in-
sulin also increased with hyperglycemia (Figure 1G), but maximal
concentrations were only reached when nutrients entered the
distal L-cell-rich portion of the CL (Mortensen et al., 2003), in
close association with the increase of plasma GLP-1 (Figure 1H).
These data suggest that after RYGB, meal-derived glucose is
primarily uptaken from the CL, where nutrients meet bile and
other digestive fluids.
Glucose Uptake Is Restored in the AL by the Addition
of Bile
To confirm the role of bile exclusion on postprandial glucose
metabolism, we measured in minipigs the systemic appearance
of glucose and D-xylose instilled in the AL, before and after
the addition of bile. We used D-xylose to clarify the contribution
of glucose intestinal uptake to the postprandial changes in
blood glucose concentrations (Fujita et al., 1998). This pentose,
actively transported from the intestinal lumen but only marginally
metabolized, is routinely used in humans to assess sugar intes-
tinal absorption (Craig and Ehrenpreis, 1999). The addition of bile
to the AL caused a sharp increase in plasma D-xylose (Figure 2A)
and blood glucose (Figure 2B) concentrations, mimicking the re-
sults of previous experiments as a MM passed through the CL
(Figure 1B).
Bile Exclusion Decreases Intestinal Sodium-Glucose
Cotransport
mRNA encoding for sodium glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1)
and other intestinal glucose transporters (GLUT1, GLUT2,
GLUT3, and GLUT5) were measured in AL and BL compared
to CL from seven minipigs. No significant difference of mRNA
levels was found among the glucose transporters except for
GLUT1, which was induced in AL as compared to CL (Figure 2C).
However, the effect of bile on the systemic appearance of
D-xylose (Figure 2A) and glucose (Figure 2B) was blunted by
SGLT1 inhibition with phlorizin. These results demonstrated
that bile exclusion decreases intestinal sodium-glucose cotrans-
port in the AL without affecting SGLT1 expression or function.
RYGB Reduces the Overall Glucose Intestinal Uptake by
Decreasing the Endoluminal Content of Sodium in the AL
After having confirmed the high sodium concentration of bile
(Wheeler et al., 1960) in minipigs (227.8 ± 10.4 mEq/l, n = 5),
we hypothesized that the net amount of sodium available for
cotransport of glucose could be reduced in the AL. We therefore
measured sodium content in the lumen of each intestinal limb of
minipigs fasted overnight that underwent RYGB (Figure 3A). The

 intraluminal sodium content was drastically reduced in the AL in
comparison with BL and CL (p < 0.05, AL versus CL and BL).
Furthermore, we explored the direct effect of sodium on intes-
tinal uptake of glucose instilled in AL. As with bile in previous ex-
periments (Figure 2), the addition of sodium alone resulted in a
sharp increase in both plasma D-xylose (Figure 3B) and blood
glucose concentrations (Figure 3C).
To test the physiological relevance of these findings ob-
tained under general anesthesia in a defined intestinal seg-
ment, we then explored the effect of adding sodium to a
MM in conscious minipigs that had undergone RYGB. In
that context, the addition of sodium to the meal enhanced
D-xylose uptake (Figures 3D and 3E) and was associated
with a significant increase in postprandial blood glucose
excursion (Figures 3F and 3G), similar to that observed in
healthy control minipigs.
These experimental results suggest that RYGB reduces the in-
testinal uptake of ingested glucose by decreasing the endolumi-
nal content of sodium normally brought into the intestine with
bile, which contributes to decreasing postprandial blood glucose
excursion.
RYGB Decreases Glucose Intestinal Uptake in Humans
To confirm the clinical relevance of our experimental findings, we
explored the effect of RYGB on the intestinal uptake of ingested
glucose and D-xylose in nine severely obese subjects who were
candidates for RYGB (Table S1). Intestinal sugar uptake and
postprandial glucose excursion were assessed prior to and
1 year after RYGB, following ingestion of a MM, containing
D-xylose, identical to that in the experimental studies. The
peak concentration of D-xylose after the meal was reduced by
25% in RYGB subjects and occurred after 30 min as compared

to after 90 min before RYGB (Figure 4A).
This reduction is likely due to the reduced
overall surface of functional intestine
available for sugar uptake from the meal
(i.e., bile containing CL), resulting in a
reduced overall postprandial area under
the curve of D-xylose (p < 0.05 after
versus before RYGB) (Figure 4B). It is
important to note that the postprandial decrease of blood
glucose concentration paralleled the decrease in plasma
D-xylose (Figures 4A and 4C). Reduced xylose uptake was asso-
ciated with a decrease in overall postprandial blood glucose
response (area under the curve) (Figure 4D). Plasma insulin con-
centrations were closely correlated to blood glucose concentra-
tions and decreased after 30 min following RYGB (Figure 4E),
despite continued elevation of plasma GLP-1 (Figure 4F).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we showed that intestinal uptake of in-
gested glucose is diminished by RYGB and restricted to the
CL, where food meets endogenous sodium contained in bile
and other digestive fluids, resulting in an overall decrease of
post prandial blood glucose excursion.
The reduction of intestinal sugar uptake in RYGB has been
previously suggested in rodents (Stearns et al., 2009). The contri-
bution of carbohydrate malabsorption to the metabolic effect of
RYGB remains, however, controversial (Seeley et al., 2015).
Several studies suggest that glucose uptake was accelerated
rather than diminished after RYGB (Rodieux et al., 2008).
Notably, ingested nutrients travel rapidly after RYGB and reach
the CL within only a few minutes. In contrast to our minipig clamp
experiments, in vivo studies can therefore hardly distinguish the
specific contribution of the AL to glucose homeostasis after an
oral challenge (Falke
´ n et al., 2011). Furthermore, most previous
studies have used free radiolabeled glucose to estimate glucose
uptake (Camastra et al., 2013; Rodieux et al., 2008), while we
measured the plasma appearance of D-xylose, incorporated in
a MM. Similar changes in D-xylose plasma concentrations
have been reported in man after a load of liquid D-xylose,

 although the difference did not reach statistical significance
(Wang et al., 2012). Lastly, the increased fecal calorie output
observed in rats submitted to RYGB further supports the
decrease of intestinal uptake of ingested carbohydrates (Saeidi
et al., 2012).
The present study also explains the reduction of postprandial
blood glucose excursion induced in vivo by the diversion of bile
in the lower intestine (Flynn et al., 2015; Goncalves et al., 2015;
Kohli et al., 2013), as well as the direct in vitro effect of bile ex-
tracts on intestinal sodium-glucose co-transport (Bakke et al.,
2014). We confirmed in the minipig that SGLT1 expression
was not reduced in the AL (Cavin et al., 2016; Stearns et al.,
2009) and demonstrated with phlorizin inhibition that sodium-
glucose co-transport remains active. Active intestinal uptake
of glucose by SGLT1 also requires the presence of sodium
(Wright et al., 2011), but alimentary products rarely contain
more than 1 mg of sodium per gram. The present study sug-
gests that the vast majority of the sodium circulating daily in
the intestine (Nightingale et al., 2006) originates from bile and
other digestive fluids, providing the high sodium microclimate
required in the intestinal lumen for the optimal active transport
of ingested glucose (Saltzman et al., 1972). This explains the
limited influence exerted by oral sodium on postprandial
glucose response in man (Thorburn et al., 1986). In healthy hu-
man subjects, the intestinal sodium content follows an antero-
grade gradient from the duodenum to the distal ileum (Olsen
and Ingelfinger, 1968), likely resulting from the progressive reab-
sorption of endogenous sodium contained in bile and digestive
fluids along the intestinal tract. We found that this pattern was
maintained after RYGB since sodium content decreased from
the BL to the CL and was minimal in the bile-deprived AL.
This explains why glucose uptake capacity of the AL is restored
when tested in vitro in the presence of sodium-rich solution
(Cavin et al., 2016). Notably, a significant part of the endoge-
nous intestinal sodium originates in the stomach with bicarbon-
ate secretion. The mechanism proposed in the present study
may therefore also contribute to reduce postprandial glycemic
response after sleeve gastrectomy. Our findings also provide
a plausible explanation for the overexpression of GLUT1 and
increased uptake of circulating labeled glucose in the AL (Cavin
et al., 2016; Saeidi et al., 2013) as a compensatory mechanism
to fuel enterocyte metabolism when luminal glucose is not
available.
In summary, the present study uncovered a previously unsus-
pected effect of upper gastrointestinal exclusion on sodium-
dependent glucose transport, through the modulation of intesti-
nal trafficking of endogenous sodium, and its likely role in the
changes of postprandial glucose homeostasis after RYGB. Our
findings do not exclude the contribution of other and potentially
intricate weight-independent intestinal mechanisms. These
mechanisms may involve bile acids trafficking and FXR (Ryan
et al., 2014) or TGR5 (McGavigan et al., 2015) signaling, yet-un-
known peptides secreted by the upper intestine impairing insulin
secretion (Rubino et al., 2006) or action (Salinari et al., 2014), glu-
coregulatory signals induced by jejunal nutrient sensing (Breen
et al., 2012) or glucose portal sensing (Troy et al., 2008), and
gut microbiota (Tremaroli et al., 2015). Our hypothesis is, how-
ever, consistent with the superior metabolic impact of RYGB var-
iants with a shorter CL—the long limb RYGB (Pinheiro et al.,
2008), the omega loop gastric bypass (Dixon et al., 2013), and
the bilio-pancreatic bypass (Mingrone et al., 2015)—and opens
important clinical perspectives. First, our results suggest that
the length of the CL, which is rarely measured and highly variable
in clinical practice, may significantly affect the metabolic
outcome of RYGB. Second, the present study identifies new
avenues to mimic the metabolic effect of bariatric surgery by
reducing intestinal glucose uptake. Recent clinical studies
confirmed the therapeutic potential of SGLT1 inhibition, which

 increased GLP-1 secretion (Dobbins et al., 2015; Zambrowicz
et al., 2012) and decreased post challenge blood glucose ex-
cursion (Dobbins et al., 2015), resulting in a dose-dependent
improvement of glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes
(Rosenstock et al., 2015). More generally, our results support the
exploration of alternative dietary or pharmacological interven-
tions to prevent or treat T2DM through the reduction of simulta-
neous intake of glucose and sodium (Zeevi et al., 2015), the mod-
ulation of the intestinal trafficking of endogenous sodium, or the
inhibition of intestinal glucose transport.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
All animal procedures were performed in the Department of Experimental
Research of the Lille 2 University (DHURE, France) in accordance with French
regulations for animal experiments and following European and French ethical
rules (approval code: CEEA 152012). A total of 37 healthy adult minipigs, either
male (n = 14) or female (n = 23) and weighing 46 ± 13 kg (Pannier’s Breeding),
were used for the study. All surgical procedures were performed under general
anesthesia after an overnight fast. More details are provided in the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Surgical Procedures
RYGB was constructed as previously described (Verhaeghe et al., 2014). More
details are provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Metabolic Evaluations
Glucose absorption studies were performed though a laparotomy 1 month af-
ter RYGB. In a first experiment (n = 5), a clamp was placed at the distal end of
the AL, prior to administration of a MM through a nasogastric tube. The MM
included 200 ml of liquid oral supplement Ensure Plus (Abott France) and a
20 g solid energy bar Ovomaltine (Ovomaltine France) and contained 13 g
fat, 15 g protein, 22 g simple sugars, and 32 g starch overall (387 kcal). Blood
samples were taken prior to and after administration of the MM. The clamp was
removed at 180 min to allow the meal to pass into the CL (Figure 1A).
In a second group of minipigs (n = 4), two clamps were placed prior to meal
administration, one on the distal part of the AL and the second at the middle of
the CL (Figure 1E). Blood samples were taken before removing the first clamp
at 30 min (AL assessment), before removing the second clamp at 150 min
(proximal CL assessment), and after removing the second clamp (distal CL
assessment).
The glucose uptake from AL was studied in four minipigs. An intestinal
segment of 100 cm was isolated between two clamps, one placed immediately
downstream of the gastro-entero anastomosis and the other 10 cm above the
jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. A bolus of 200 ml containing 75 g of glucose and
30 g of D-xylose was injected between the clamps. Blood samples were taken
prior to and 5, 15, and 30 min after bolus administration. At 30 min, 25 ml of bile
was collected from the gallbladder and injected into the intestinal segment.
More blood samples were taken at 35, 45, and 60 min. This experiment was
repeated in four animals in which 12.5 g phlorizin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added
to the sugar bolus, and in four other minipigs in which the bile was replaced
by 25 ml of saline solution containing 1 g of sodium.
The overall effect of sodium on glucose homeostasis and glucose intestinal
absorption during a standardized MM test was evaluated in conscious mini-
pigs who had undergone RYGB with a 150 cm CL (n = 5). A MM containing
30 g of D-xylose (Sigma-Aldrich) was administered after an overnight fast
through a nasogastric tube. Blood samples were drawn through the central
venous catheter prior to and after meal administration during 180 min. Blood
glucose and plasma D-xylose levels were measured. 48 hours later, the exper-
iment was repeated in the same animals with the addition of 2 g of sodium to
the MM.
Intraluminal sodium content and mRNA encoding for intestinal glucose
transporters (SGLT1, GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, and GLUT5; Table S2) were
measured in the three intestinal limbs 1 month after RYGB in 5 and 7 minipigs,
respectively. More details are provided in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Clinical Study
Nine severely obese subjects who were candidates for bariatric surgery were
enrolled in this study. Clinical and biological subject characteristics at the time
of pre- and postoperative visits are summarized in Table S1. The institutional
review board approved the study protocol, and all patients provided written
informed consent (Clinical Gov NCT01129297). RYGB was performed with a

 30 ml gastric pouch, a stapled gastrojejunal anastomosis with an AL of 150 cm,
connected to the BL 70 cm below the duodeno-jejunal junction with a side-to-
side jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. A MM test was performed after an overnight
fast, prior to surgery and 1 year after RYGB, using a standardized meal con-
taining D-xylose, like in minipig meal studies. Blood glucose, plasma D-xylose,
insulin, and GLP-1 were measured prior to and during 180 min after MM
ingestion.
Biological Analyses
Blood glucose, plasma insulin, GLP-1, and D-xylose were measured as previ-
ously described (Verhaeghe et al., 2014). More details are provided in the Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analysis
Results were expressed as mean ± SEM or SD as indicated. Continuous vari-
ables were analyzed by the unpaired or paired Student’s t test and one-way
ANOVA as appropriate. Dynamic variables during the clamp tests were
compared to baseline value, with one-way ANOVA for repeated-measures
and Bonferroni post-hoc test. Differences of dynamic variables during the
MM tolerance test between groups were analyzed with two-way ANOVA for
repeated-measures, and Bonferroni post-hoc test. A value of p < 0.05 was
considered as significant. All calculations were made with Prism 6 for Mac
OS X (GraphPad).
