abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Multiple environmental risk factors are associated with sleep-
related infant deaths. Little is known about differences in risk factors for deaths occurring 
in-home and out-of-home. We sought to compare risk factors for in-home and out-of-home 
infant deaths.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of sleep-related infant deaths from 2004 
to 2014 in the National Child Fatality Review and Prevention database. The main exposure 
was setting (in-home versus out-of-home) at time of death. Primary outcomes were known 
risk factors: sleep position, sleep location (eg, crib), objects in the environment, and bed 
sharing. Risk factors for in-home versus out-of-home deaths were compared using the  
χ2 test and multivariate logistic regressions.
RESULTS: A total of 11 717 deaths were analyzed. Infants who died out-of-home were more 
likely to be in a stroller/car seat (adjusted odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval,  
2.1–3.4; P < .001) and other locations (adjusted odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 
1.5–2.3; P < .001), and placed prone (adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval,  
1.1–1.3; P < 0.01). Bed sharing was less common out-of-home (adjusted odds ratio, 0.7; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.6–0.7; P < .001). There were no differences in sleeping on a couch/ 
chair, or objects in the sleep environment.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep-related infant deaths in the out-of-home setting have higher odds of 
having certain risk factors, such as prone placement for sleep and location in a stroller/car 
seat, rather than in a crib/bassinet. Caregivers should be educated on the importance of 
placing infants to sleep supine in cribs/bassinets to protect against sleep-related deaths, 
both in and out of the home.

Sleep-related infant deaths are those 
that occur during sleep or in a sleep 
environment; these comprise a large 
majority of sudden and unexpected 
infant deaths (SUID).1 Sleep-
related infant deaths are generally 
understood to include sudden infant 
death syndrome (SIDS), accidental 
suffocation and strangulation in bed 
(ASSB), and other ill-defined deaths, 
and account for ∼3500 infant deaths 
in the United States each year.2
Risk factors for sleep-related 
infant deaths include both intrinsic 
biological factors and aspects of the 
sleep environment.3 Risk factors 
related to the sleep environment are 
well established and include side 
and prone sleep position, sleeping on 
surfaces other than cribs/bassinets, 
soft and loose bedding, and bed 
sharing.1 However, because most 
of these deaths occur in the infant’s 
home, very little is known about risk 
factors for deaths occurring outside 
of the infant’s home. Most of the 
data available about out-of-home 
infant deaths are for those that have 
occurred in child care settings.4, 
 
5 
Infants dying in child care were more 
likely to die during the first week of 
child care and were more likely to be 
last placed or found prone, when the 
usual sleep position is nonprone.4 
One additional study with data about 
out-of-home deaths is a case-control 
study from Germany, which found 
that the risk of SIDS was higher when 
the infant slept at a relative’s home 
compared with the parental home, 
although no analysis of risk factors 
by setting was conducted.6 In this 
study, we sought to identify risk 
factors for sleep-related infant death 
occurring in a broad range of settings 
outside of the parental home. We 
hypothesized that, because the usual 
sleep location (eg, crib, bassinet) may 
not be available outside of the home, 
deaths in out-of-home settings are 
more likely to be in unsafe locations 
(eg, adult beds, sofas).
MeThODs
Data source
After receiving approval from the 
National Center for Fatality Review 
and Prevention (NCFRP) and consent 
from 45 states participating in the 
NCFRP, we received a de-identified 
dataset of infant deaths occurring in 
2004 to 2014. This dataset included 
demographic information on the child, 
caregivers and primary supervisors 
at the time of death, setting (ie, child’s 
home, relative’s home, or child care) 
and other known risk factors, such 
as sleep position, sleep location (eg, 
crib), and presence of items in the 
sleep location.7, 
 
8 The NCFRP dataset 
has been previously described.9, 
 
10
study subjects
We included all deaths of infants (ie, 
<12 months old) that occurred during 
sleep or in a sleep environment. 
Deaths due to non–sleep-related 
medical conditions, homicide, or 
for which the setting was missing 
or unknown were excluded. On the 
basis of data regarding cause of death 
determination, cases were assigned 
to 1 of 3 causes of death: SIDS/SUID, 
ASSB, and unknown/ undetermined. 
This study was deemed exempt by 
the institutional review boards of 
Children’s National Medical Center 
and the University of Virginia.
setting of Death
Deaths were classified as occurring 
at the child’s home (“in-home”) or 
outside of the child’s home (“out-of-
home”). Out-of-home deaths included 
those at friends’ or relatives’ homes 
(regardless of duration of stay), 
licensed or unlicensed child care 
centers, vehicles, temporary housing, 
jails, hotels/motels, and public spaces.
sleep Location, Position, and Other 
Risk Factors
We classified sleep location as follows: 
crib, bassinet and playpen, car seat/
stroller, adult bed or on a person, 
couch or sofa, other (eg, floor, futon, 
pillow, and bean bag), and unknown. 
Additional risk factors included bed 
sharing and the presence of objects, 
such as pillows, quilts and other items, 
in the sleep environment. The sleep 
position in which infants were placed 
and found was categorized as supine, 
side, and prone.
Other study Definitions
Infant demographic characteristics 
included age, sex, and race/ethnicity. 
Infant age was classified as 0 to 3 
months, 4 to 6 months, and 7 to 11 
months, because our previous studies 
have found that the importance of 
specific risk factors differ in these 
age categories.7 Race/ethnicity was 
classified as non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and 
other. The primary caregiver and 
supervisor at the time of death were 
classified as parent, relative/friend, 
foster parent, licensed or unlicensed 
child care provider (which included 
babysitters), or other.
Data analysis
Data were analyzed by using Stata, 
version 11.2 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX) and SPSS, version 21 
(IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation, 
Armonk, NY). As previously 
described, 
7, 
 
9 the Markov Monte Carlo 
method was performed to impute 
missing data. Descriptive statistics were 
used to describe demographic and 
sleep environment risk factors among 
infants who died in-home versus out-
of-home. We compared the presence of 
risk factors by group (in-home versus 
out-of-home) using the χ2 test and 
used multivariate logistic regression, 
adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and 
sex, to calculate the odds of a risk 
factor in the out-of-home setting 
compared with the in-home setting.
ResuLTs
Population characteristics
There were 13 471 infant deaths 
included in the dataset. A total of 
11 717 (87.0%) met the inclusion 
criteria and were included in the

analysis. The majority of deaths 
(79.9%) occurred in-home (Table 1). 
Most (69.4%) of these deaths occurred 
before 4 months of age, and the 
majority (58.0%) of infants were boys. 
Non-Hispanic whites were the largest 
racial/ethnic group (44.7%). The cause 
of death was unknown/undetermined 
for 43.9% of cases, with SIDS/SUID and 
ASSB being the cause for 27.4% and 
28.7% of cases, respectively. Parents 
were most frequently the supervisor 
(85.2%) at the time of death.
Comparing in-home and out-of-home 
deaths, a higher percentage of infants 
who died in-home were <4 months 
of age (70.8% in-home vs 63.9% 
out-of-home; P < .0001). A higher 
percentage of non-Hispanic white 
infants died out-of-home compared 
with in-home (47.8% out-of-home 
vs 43.9% in-home), whereas non-
Hispanic black infants were more 
likely to die in-home (32.4% in-home 
vs 28.9% out-of-home; P < .01). In 
infants’ homes, 93.2% of primary 
supervisors were parents, compared 
with 53.3% in the out-of-home 
setting (P < .001). In the out-of-
home setting, a higher percentage of 
primary supervisors at the time of 
death were licensed and unlicensed 
child care providers (24.0% vs 1.3%) 
and relatives (17.4% vs 4.9%; P < 
.001). The majority of out-of-home 
deaths occurred at relatives’ homes 
(60.1%), followed by child care 
settings (22.3%), including licensed 
and unlicensed child care and 
babysitters’ homes.
sleep environment Risk Factors: 
bivariate analyses
Overall, 9.0% of infants had no sleep 
environment risk factors present. This 
percentage was similar among deaths 
occurring in out-of-home (10.1%) and 
in-home settings (8.7%). The plurality 
of all infants were placed for sleep 
supine (42.4%), on an adult bed or a 
person (51.9%), and was bed sharing 
(54.7%) at the time of death (Table 2). 
One or more objects were present in 
the sleep environment of one-third of 
all infants. Differences in risk factors 
existed by setting. In-home deaths 
were more likely to occur on an adult 
bed or while held by a person (53.4%) 
compared with those that occurred  
in out-of-home settings (45.7%;  
P < .001). Bed sharing was also 
more likely to be present in in-home 
(57.1%) than out-of-home (45.3%) 
deaths (P < .001). Infants who died 
out-of-home were more likely to be 
found in the prone position (43.1% 
vs 38.8%; P < .001). Differences in 
change in position were of statistical 
significance, with a slightly higher 
percentage of out-of-home infants 
being found prone after being 
placed to sleep in the supine or side 
position. There was no difference in 
the presence of objects in the sleep 
environment.
Multivariate Models for sleep 
environment
After adjusting for infant age, race/
ethnicity and sex, children who died 
out-of-home had approximately 
twice the odds of being in a car seat/
stroller or other location (eg, floor, 
futon, pillow, and bean bag) than 
infants who died in-home (Table 3.) 
Out-of-home infants had 30% lower

odds of bed sharing at the time of 
death. Out-of-home infants were 
also slightly more likely to have been 
placed to sleep in the prone position 
(odds ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05–1.32; 
P < .01). There were no differences 
between the 2 groups for objects 
found in the sleep environment.
DIscussIOn
In this analysis of 11 717 deaths, there 
were important differences in sleep 
environment risk factors for infants 
who died out-of-home. Infants who 
died out-of-home had higher odds of 
dying in a location other than a crib, 
bassinet, or playpen, such as a car 
seat/stroller, futon, pillow and bean 
bag. Our findings also suggest that 
out-of-home, infants have higher odds 
of having been placed in the prone 
position at the time of death.
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommends that infants be placed 
for sleep in the supine position in a 
crib or bassinet.1 Although the current 
study could not provide reasons for 
sleep location, out-of-home settings 
are often temporary or transient 
situations, because they may occur 
while the family is traveling, living 
in temporary housing, or visiting 
friends or relatives. It is possible that 
many infants who were out-of-home 
did not have a portable crib either 
because of cost or inconvenience, and 
were therefore placed in locations 
other than a crib/bassinet. Car 
seats/strollers may be convenient 
locations for infants to sleep if the 
family is traveling or in an otherwise 
transient situation. However, they 
are not recommended for routine 
sleep because of the potential risk 
of upper airway obstruction.1 One 
review of US Consumer Product 
Safety Commission records of deaths 
involving sitting and carrying devices 
included 31 deaths in car seats and 3 
in strollers. A total of 48% of car seat 
deaths and all 3 stroller deaths were 
attributed to positional asphyxia; the

other car seat deaths were attributed 
to strangulation from straps.11 More 
research will be needed to better 
understand the epidemiology and 
mechanism of these deaths to better 
inform families.
After adjusting for age, race/
ethnicity, and sex, we also found 
that infants who died out-of-home 
were more likely to be placed prone. 
This may be at least partly due to 
having nonparental caregivers when 
out-of-home. Although parents 
were the majority of supervisors 
among in-home and out-of-home 
deaths, child care providers and 
relatives/friends comprised a higher 
percentage of supervisors for out-
of-home deaths than for in-home 
deaths. Studies of sleep practices in 
child care settings have found that 
many child care providers place 
infants prone for sleep.4, 
 
5, 
 
12 Although 
public health campaigns targeting 
parents and primary caregivers in 
the home setting and at licensed child 
care settings improve knowledge 
about safe sleep practices13, 
14 and 
have resulted in a significant decline 
in the risk of sleep-related deaths 
among infants, 
15 the findings of this 
study suggest continued gaps in 
practices to prevent sleep-related 
infant deaths, particularly in out-
of-home settings and in settings 
with nonparental caregivers. 
Unfortunately, for many parents 
who need to re-enter the work force 
after the birth of a child, the care of 
infants outside of the home is not a 
choice, but an unavoidable economic 
necessity. Providing those who care 
for children outside of the home, 
including nonparental caregivers 
(eg, relatives and babysitters) and 
licensed and unlicensed child care 
providers, with education regarding 
safe sleep practices is critical. In 
addition, informing parents about the 
need to maintain safe sleep practices 
while traveling (eg, traveling with 
portable cribs) and ensuring that 
individuals who are caring for their 
children out-of-home implement 
safe sleep practices, such as supine 
sleeping, will be important. Programs 
that distribute portable cribs may 
also be helpful in disseminating 
information about the need for safe 
sleep practices in all settings.14
The reasons for risk factor 
differences identified in this study 
deserve further investigation and 
the findings should be interpreted 
in light of several limitations. There 
are limitations inherent in the NCFRP 
database. Each state determines 
which child deaths are investigated 
and thus which deaths are included 
in the database. Therefore, the 
NCFRP database may not include all 
child deaths within each state, and 
consequently the data cannot be 
compared 1-to-1 with vital statistics 
data.10 There may also be a selection 
bias. In addition, rates cannot be 
calculated from the data unless 
there is a well-defined denominator 
and, without detailed analysis, the 
data cannot be assumed to be a 
representative sample of all deaths. 
Furthermore, we were unable to 
adjust for some important factors 
contributing to the risk of sleep-
related death in infants, including 
maternal age, breastfeeding status, 
known biological risk factors, 
exposure to tobacco smoke, and 
birth weight or prematurity.16 It 
is unknown if inclusion of these 
factors would alter our findings. In 
particular, there may be differences 
in infants who were cared for out-of-
home that may be associated with a 
history of prematurity or the family’s 
socioeconomic status. Finally, 
because data about risk factors were 
largely collected through caregiver 
interviews, recall bias is another 
important limitation of this study 
and thus, some risk factors may have 
been underreported. Nonetheless, 
our findings provide insight into the 
differences in risk factors for sleep-
related deaths occurring out-of-
home. This information will help to 
direct resources and education about 
providing safe sleep environments in 
out-of-home settings. Future studies 
can further explore the reasons 
behind the differences found in this 
study and determine the contribution 
of important factors that we were 
unable to examine.

Among infants with sleep-related 
deaths, known risk factors, such as 
sleep location and position, were 
more likely to be present in out-of-
home settings compared with infants’ 
homes. Education of parents and 
nonparental caregivers regarding 
the necessity of cribs/bassinets and 
supine sleep position to protect 
against sleep-related deaths both 
in-home and out-of-home is needed.
