To the Editor:
We appreciate the wide interest in the results from 
the international extended transsternal thymectomy 
trial in non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis (MG) (1). 
Correspondence has been received from several medical 
communities including neurologists, thoracic surgeons, 
and pathologists. And we thank Tzankov and Bourque and 
Warman Chardon for their gracious comments. 
Tzankov (2) frames the role of thymectomy in both 
thymomatous and non-thymomatous MG while Bourque 
and Warman Chardon (3) summarize the historical record 
of randomized, controlled treatment trials in the disease. 
Both single out the evidence gap related to thymectomy we 
worked to bridge with our trial. The practice parameter by 
Gronseth and Barohn (4) in 2000 explicitly called for such 
an effort. There are several points raised by the authors 
we wish to clarify. The first is the decision to use minimal 
manifestation status (MMS) as opposed to remission as the 
clinical endpoint that dictated prednisone dosing changes. 
Remission in MG, especially when formally defined (5), is 
relatively uncommon (15–25%), no matter the intervention 
(6,7). MMS is more commonly encountered and is accepted 
as a favorable outcome. A clinical status of MMS or better 
was defined as the treatment goal in the recently published 
international consensus guidance for MG management (8). 
As for the thymic tissue, further analysis of the resected 
specimens and correlation of histopathological findings with 
clinical outcomes are in the works.
There is no question that conducting randomized 
surgical trials presents challenges, and the thymectomy 
study was no different. Disease duration and upper age 
limits were modified to boost recruitment; these were the 
only changes made over the 9-year duration of the trial. 
We did consider loosening the entry criteria that forbade 
any immunosuppressive therapy outside of corticosteroids, 
but concluded such agents would cloud interpretation of 
study results. Similarly, we weighed the advantages and 
disadvantages of permitting less invasive thymectomy 
approaches, but decided against this allowance as well, 
mandating that the extended transsternal technique be 
utilized. We were conducting the first randomized trial 
of thymectomy and felt it imperative to first demonstrate 
whether there was benefit to an as-complete resection 
as possible. Nevertheless, our inference is that a similar 
constellation of benefits can be expected with less invasive 
approaches as long as the surgeon’s intent is to perform as 
complete a thymectomy as possible. 
The role of thymectomy in double-seronegative and 
muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive MG 
deserves final comment. Thymectomy does appear to have 
a positive impact in double-seronegative patients (7), an 
observation that may reflect the likelihood that many of

these patients actually harbor anti-acetylcholine receptor 
antibodies when tested with cell-based assays that cluster 
the receptor, mimicking the architecture of the post-
synaptic membrane (9,10). In most reports, thymectomy in 
MuSK-antibody positive patients seems to have little if any 
favorable impact (7,8), providing further emphasis to the 
need to individualize management approaches for patients 
with MG.
