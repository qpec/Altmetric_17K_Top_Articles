Evidence before this study 
47 
While there is evidence that accelerated lung function decline is associated with COPD development, 
48 
the relationship between the full expression of lung function, encompassing an individual’s lifetime 
49 
trajectory capturing both growth and decline, and COPD, has never been reported. We searched for 
50 
articles in PubMed up to July 28, 2017 using the search terms: “lung function”, “growth”, “decline”, 
51 
“pattern*” and “trajector*”. From 266 identified papers, only two classified lung function 
52 
trajectories based on more than 2 repeated lung function measurements. However, one was 
53 
restricted to participants with childhood asthma and both were unable to capture the lung function 
54 
decline phase due to duration of the follow-up (maximum age at last measurement being 32 years). 
55 
Additionally, it is critical to understand how child and adult factors interact to determine 
56 
membership of healthy as well as adverse lifetime trajectories to inform lifetime preventive 
57 
strategies and promote lung health. Such evidence does not currently exist. 
58 
Added value of this study 
59 
Our findings of associations between distinct lung function trajectories and risk of COPD provide 
60 
novel insights into the role of lifetime lung function trajectories in the aetiology of COPD, and show 
61 
the potential for interventions promoting healthy lung function and lessening COPD risk. Our study is 
62 
the first to model lung function trajectories from childhood to the sixth decade of life in a general 
63 
 3 
 
population. We identified six distinct trajectories. Three trajectories exhibiting lower lung function in 
64 
childhood with subsequent normal or accelerated decline had increased the risk of COPD, and 
65 
collectively accounted for most COPD cases. Most importantly, moderate/severe COPD cases (GOLD 
66 
stage 2 or more) arose only from these three trajectories. Early life factors including allergic 
67 
diseases, lung infections, parental asthma and maternal smoking predicted three unfavourable lung 
68 
function trajectories. Personal smoking amplified the effect of maternal smoking on belonging to the 
69 
worst lung function trajectory.  
70 
Implications of all the available evidence 
71 
Reducing maternal smoke exposure and personal smoking, and encouraging immunization, are 
72 
identified as public health targets to prevent adverse lung function trajectories and reduce future 
73 
COPD burden. Clinicians and patients with asthma should be made aware of the potential long-term 
74 
implications of non-optimal asthma control throughout life, and this should be investigated in future 
75 
intervention trials.

SUMMARY 
81 
Background 
82 
Lifetime lung function is related to quality of life and longevity. Over the lifespan, individuals follow 
83 
different lung function trajectories. It is important to identify these trajectories, their determinants 
84 
and outcomes but no study has done this beyond the fourth decade.   
85 
Methods 
86 
We modelled trajectories of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured at 7, 13, 18, 45, 
87 
50 and 53 years (n=2438). The trajectories identified were then related to childhood factors and 
88 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) risk.  
89 
Findings 
90 
Six trajectories were identified: “early below average, accelerated decline” (4%, n=97), “persistently 
91 
low” (5·6%, n=136), “below average” (31·6%, n=772), “persistently high” (12·1%, n=293), “early low, 
92 
accelerated growth, normal decline” (8%, n=196), and “average” (38·7%, n=944). The first three 
93 
trajectories had increased risk of COPD at age 53 compared with the average group: OR 35(95%CI 
94 
19·5-64); 9·5(4·5-20·6); and 3·7(1·9-6·9) respectively. Early-life predictors of the three trajectories 
95 
included childhood asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, hayfever, eczema, parental asthma, and 
96 
maternal smoking. Personal smoking and active adult asthma increased the impact of maternal 
97 
smoking and childhood asthma respectively on the “early below average, accelerated decline” 
98 
trajectory.  
99 
Interpretation 
100 
We identified six potential FEV1 trajectories, two of which were novel. Three trajectories 
101 
contributed 75% of COPD burden and were associated with modifiable early-life exposures 
102 
whose impact was aggravated by adult factors. We postulate that reducing maternal 
103 
smoking; encouraging immunization; and avoiding personal smoking, especially in those 
104 
 5 
 
with smoking parents and/or low childhood lung function, may minimize COPD risk. 
105 
Clinicians and asthmatic patients should be made aware of the potential long-term 
106 
implications of non-optimal asthma control for lung function trajectory throughout life, and 
107 
this should be investigated in future intervention trials.

INTRODUCTION 
114 
Lifetime lung function is related to quality of life and longevity. Recent studies highlight that low lung 
115 
function, especially low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in early adulthood is associated 
116 
with incidence of respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic abnormalities, and all-cause mortality.1,2 
117 
Over the lifespan, lung function progresses though different growth and decline phases3,4 and 
118 
individuals have unique lifetime lung function trajectories based on these phases. Trajectories may 
119 
have different risk factors and different consequences for chronic lung disease risk, particularly 
120 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the expected third largest cause of death globally by 
121 
2030.5 Insights into how lung function trajectories develop over the lifespan are important for lung 
122 
disease prediction, prevention and management.     
123 
Repeated lung function measurements from childhood into late adulthood are needed to identify 
124 
lifetime lung function trajectories but data are sparse. Among the few studies with longitudinal lung 
125 
function measurements, only two studies6,7 have published lung function trajectories based on more 
126 
than two time points, one being restricted to subjects with childhood asthma.7 However, both were 
127 
unable to capture the decline phase, vital for lung health outcomes in later life, as they had data only 
128 
to the fourth decade.  While there is evidence that both maximally attained FEV1 and its decline are 
129 
associated with the COPD development 8, the relationship between the full expression of lung 
130 
function,  encompassing an individual’s trajectory capturing both growth and decline, and COPD, has 
131 
never been reported. Furthermore, it is critical to understand how childhood and adult factors 
132 
interact to determine membership of healthy as well as adverse lifetime trajectories. 
133 
Despite inter-individual variation in lung function trajectories within a general population, there may 
134 
be distinct subpopulations following similar FEV1 trajectories. The Tasmanian Longitudinal Health 
135 
Study (TAHS), a population-based cohort study with multiple assessments of lung function, provided 
136 
an opportunity to investigate lung function trajectories into the sixth decade. We aimed to: (1) 
137 
characterize population FEV1trajectories from the first to the sixth decade; (2) investigate their 
138 
 7 
 
childhood predictors and interaction with adult asthma and personal smoking; (3) relate trajectories 
139 
to COPD risk.      
140 
METHODS 
141 
Study design and data collection   
142 
Six waves of TAHS9 were used. TAHS began in 1968 when 8,583 Tasmanian children born in 1961 and 
143 
attending school in Tasmania were enrolled. At age 7 (baseline), the children underwent a clinical 
144 
examination including pre-bronchodilator (BD) spirometry and parents completed a questionnaire. 
145 
Follow-up assessments were conducted at 13, 18, 45 and 50 years with pre-BD spirometry 
146 
measured. In the most recent follow-up in 2015, when the participants were 53 years old, all those 
147 
from the original cohort who were alive and had up-to-date contact details were invited to attend a 
148 
clinical study. Pre- and post-BD spirometry were performed in 2,689 participants. Those with at least 
149 
two waves of lung function data at age 7 and 53 comprised the study population (n=2438) (see 
150 
supplement).  
151 
Lung function measurements 
152 
Pre- and post-BD spirometry was conducted according to the American Thoracic Society and 
153 
European Respiratory Society joint guidelines.10 Spirometry z-scores were derived from the Global 
154 
Lung Initiative (GLI) reference equations11 which have been validated in an Australian population.12 
155 
Definition of variables (see supplement) 
156 
Childhood factors (asthma, bronchitis, eczema, hayfever, food allergy, pneumonia, breast feeding, 
157 
weight status, parental asthma and parental smoking) were defined using the information provided 
158 
by parents in 1968. COPD was defined as post-BD FEV1/FVC<Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) at 53 years. 
159 
Other adulthood factors were defined using information provided by participants at age 53 years.   
160 
Statistical analysis 
161 
Identification of lung function trajectories 
162 
 8 
 
Pre-BD FEV1 z-scores at six time points (7, 13, 18, 45, 50 and 53 years) were analysed using group-
163 
based trajectory modelling (GBTM) to identify distinct subgroups of individuals whose 
164 
measurements followed a similar pattern over time.13 GBTM estimated the population prevalence of 
165 
each lung function trajectory subgroup, and the posterior probability of each individual belonging to 
166 
each subgroup. Parameter values determining models with an increasing number of trajectories 
167 
were derived using maximum likelihood estimation to determine the best fitting model (see 
168 
Supplement).14,15 This method allows handling of missing data for each individual, and produces 
169 
asymptotically unbiased parameter estimates. As well as model fit, interpretation of trajectories was 
170 
also considered in the selection of the final model. Assignment of a single trajectory subgroup to 
171 
each individual was based on the modal method (the highest posterior probability for that 
172 
individual).  
173 
Investigating factors associated with identified lung function trajectories 
174 
 We first examined the association between each childhood predictor and the six-category trajectory 
175 
variable using multinomial logistic regression. Childhood predictors were retained  based on a 5 
176 
degree-of-freedom likelihood ratio test. Then we employed two modelling approaches in parallel: In 
177 
the first, we used logistic regression to investigate associations between each childhood predictor 
178 
and lung function trajectories, where each trajectory was compared with the “average” trajectory - 
179 
the “non-disease” group. For each childhood predictor, a specific minimal sufficient set of potential 
180 
confounders was selected based on causal diagrams (Directed Acyclic Graphs [DAGs]).16 Interactions 
181 
between parental and personal smoking, childhood asthma and adult active asthma were tested. 
182 
Using the likelihood ratio test, an interaction term with p-value < 0.1 was retained in the final model. 
183 
For comparison, we used a second approach in which all childhood predictors with a p-value < 0.15, 
184 
computed using likelihood ratio test, were included in a single multivariable multinomial logistic 
185 
regression model adjusted simultaneously for all childhood predictors. The results of these two 
186 
approaches were almost similar, thus only results for the first were presented. Associations between 
187 
 9 
 
lung function trajectories as a predictor and COPD at 53 years were investigated using logistic 
188 
regression; in case of groups with sparse data (for COPD cases), penalized maximum likelihood 
189 
logistic regression was used to reduce bias in estimates of regression coefficients.17 Population-
190 
attributable fractions of COPD were estimated for trajectories.18 All analyses were performed using 
191 
Stata 13.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) with a GBTM plug-in.15 
192 
Ethics 
193 
The study was approved by the Human Ethics Review Committees of all relevant institutions. Written 
194 
informed consent was obtained from all participants. 
195 
Role of the funding source 
196 
The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, 
197 
or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had 
198 
final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 
199 
RESULTS  
200 
Baseline characteristics of participants  
201 
Of 8583 participants from the original cohort, 2438 with longitudinal lung function data were analysed. 
202 
The participants included had similar baseline characteristics to those not included except for more 
203 
females and more eczema, and fewer smoking parents (Table S1 in supplement). Those included and 
204 
those deceased by 53 years also had similar baseline characteristics (Table S2).  
205 
Lung function trajectories  
206 
The best fitting model identified six lung function trajectories (Figure 1). The average membership 
207 
probability of individuals in each trajectory exceeded 0·7, suggesting good model adequacy.19 Based 
208 
on lung function at age 7 years and growth and decline rates, trajectories were given the following 
209 
labels: “average” (38·7%; n=944), “early below average, accelerated decline” (4%; n=97), “persistently 
210 
 10 
 
low” (5·6%; n=136), “early low, accelerated growth, normal decline” (8·0%; n=196), “persistently high” 
211 
(12·0%; n=293), and “below average” (31·6%; n=772) (see supplement). The “average” trajectory had 
212 
lung function consistently around the population mean over time. The means of the raw values of 
213 
FEV1 at six time points among trajectories are presented in Figure S1. In a sensitivity analysis, exclusion 
214 
of the data point with the smallest number of observations (at 18 years) yielded six very similar lung 
215 
function trajectories (Figure S2). 
216 
Childhood factors and lung function trajectories 
217 
Prevalence of childhood factors among lung function trajectories are shown in Table 1. Adjusted 
218 
associations between these factors and lung function trajectories compared to the average 
219 
trajectory are presented (Table 2). Individuals with the “early below average, accelerated decline” 
220 
trajectory were more likely to have childhood asthma (OR 3·1: 95%CI 1·9-5·2), bronchitis (2·0: 1·2-
221 
3·2), hayfever (2·0: 1·2-3·4), pneumonia (2·0: 1·2-3·5), and a heavy smoking mother (2·5: 1·1-5·9).  
222 
The “persistently low” trajectory was associated with childhood asthma (OR 1·7: 95%CI 1·2-2·7), 
223 
particularly frequent asthma symptoms (4·2: 2·2-7·8) and early asthma onset (2·0:1·1-3·4), eczema 
224 
(1·8: 1·1-3·0), and parental asthma (1·8: 1·1-2·9). A modest association was seen between this 
225 
trajectory and food allergy (1·8: 0·94-3·4), and childhood underweight (2·2:0·95-5·2). There were 
226 
synergistic effects between childhood asthma and eczema (p=0·07) and hayfever (p=0·06). 
227 
Participants with childhood asthma, eczema and hayfever had a 4·9 (1·9-12) fold risk increase for the 
228 
“persistently low” trajectory. 
229 
Having the “below average” trajectory was associated with childhood pneumonia (OR 1·3: 95%CI 
230 
1·0-1·8). The effects of the childhood factors on the three trajectories listed above were 
231 
independent of adult personal smoking.  
232 
Females and underweight children were more likely to have an “early low, accelerated growth, 
233 
normal decline” trajectory (OR 1·7: 95%CI 1·2-2·3 and 2·6:1·3-5·2, respectively). The effect of 
234 
 11 
 
underweight on this trajectory became non-significant when weight gain between 7-11 years was 
235 
added to the model (OR 2·0:0·9-4·5).   
236 
No significant associations were observed between childhood factors and the “persistently high” 
237 
trajectory.  
238 
The interactions of adult asthma and smoking with childhood factors, and lung function 
239 
trajectories 
240 
The prevalences of adult active asthma and personal smoking are presented in Table 3. Adult active 
241 
asthma and personal smoking were independently associated with three trajectories: “early below 
242 
average, accelerated decline”, “below average” and “persistently low” (Table S3).  
243 
We observed a significant interaction between heavy maternal smoking and personal smoking 
244 
defined using pack-years (p<0·001) for the risk of belonging to the “early below average, accelerated 
245 
decline” trajectory. The adverse impact of maternal smoking increased with increasing personal 
246 
smoking (Figure S3).  
247 
There was evidence of interaction between childhood asthma and adult active asthma for the risk of 
248 
the “early below average, accelerated decline” trajectory (p=0·08) with the effect of childhood 
249 
asthma mainly evident in participants with adult active asthma. 
250 
Lung function trajectories (based on pre-BD FEV1) and COPD (based on post-BD measures) at 53 
251 
years  
252 
At 53 years, those in the “early below average, accelerated decline” trajectory had the highest 
253 
prevalence of COPD (46%), followed by the “persistently low” trajectory (12·5%) and the “below 
254 
average” trajectory (6%) (Figure 2). Compared with the “average” trajectory, these three trajectories 
255 
had 35 (95%CI 19·5-64), 9·5 (4·5-20·6), and 3·7 (1·9-6·9) fold increased risk of COPD respectively 
256 
(Table S4). The distribution of COPD cases among trajectories is presented in Figure S4. The 
257 
 12 
 
population-attributable fractions for the three trajectories “early below average, accelerated 
258 
decline”, “persistently low”, and “below average” in relation to COPD were 35·4%, 12·6% and 27·2%, 
259 
respectively. For moderate/severe COPD (an addition of FEV1<80% predicted values), all cases only 
260 
arose from three trajectories, “early below average, accelerated decline”, “below average” and 
261 
“persistently low”. 
262 
We replicated the analysis by defining COPD using the FEV1/FVC <0.7 and findings were not 
263 
materially different to those using LLN (table S5). We found similar results using a clinical definition 
264 
of COPD (see supplement) (Table S6). 
265 
DISCUSSION  
266 
Our study is unique in that it is the first to characterize lung function trajectories in a large general 
267 
population sample from early childhood to the sixth decade. This is of considerable importance 
268 
because understanding lifetime lung function is crucial for population-based interventions to 
269 
promote advantaged trajectories and prevent disadvantaged ones. We identified six distinct FEV1 
270 
trajectories including two novel trajectories, namely, “early below average, accelerated decline” and 
271 
“early low, accelerated growth, normal decline”. These two trajectories contradict the notion that 
272 
lung function established in childhood tracks through life. Three of the six trajectories had increased 
273 
risk of developing COPD by middle-age, namely, “early below average, accelerated decline”, “below 
274 
average”, and “persistently low”. Seventy-five percentof COPD cases at 53 years was attributable to 
275 
these three trajectories. Most importantly, moderate/severe COPD cases arose only  from these 
276 
three trajectories. Childhood asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, hayfever, eczema, parental asthma 
277 
and maternal smoking during childhood increased the risk of these three trajectories. We showed 
278 
that aggravation of the impact of childhood risk factors by adult personal smoking and active asthma 
279 
lead to our newly established “early below average, accelerated decline” trajectory.  
280 
To date only two published studies6,7 have identified lung function trajectories. Both were unable to 
281 
incorporate the adult decline phase, as they had data only into early adulthood. McGeachie and 
282 
 13 
 
colleagues7 described four FEV1 trajectories from age 7 to 26 years in 684 asthmatics. This study 
283 
provided novel insights into how lung function changed over time in asthmatics, but cannot be 
284 
compared with our population-based results. Furthermore, we used an unsupervised modelling 
285 
method, which facilitates capture of distinct groups with similar trajectories. The population-based 
286 
Tucson Children’s Respiratory Study6 modelled lung function from 11 to 32 years in 599 participants 
287 
identifying only a persistently low and a normal trajectory. The reasons they identified fewer 
288 
trajectories  than our analysis may include smaller sample size and shorter follow-up. 
289 
Using similar statistical methodology to ours, a study from two population-based birth cohorts 
290 
(MAAS and ALSPAC) published in this issue of the journal, found four FEV1trajectories between ages 
291 
5 and 24 years (persistently high, average, below average and persistently low).20 We also found 
292 
these trajectories, and identified two further trajectories. Our study’s ability to tease out more 
293 
trajectories may be explained by our larger sample size and follow-up into the decline phase.  
294 
COPD risk attributed to our identified trajectories provides insight into potential origins of and 
295 
pathways to COPD. The “below average” and “persistently low” trajectories representing a pathway 
296 
to COPD with mostly childhood origins contributed half the COPD cases in our study. This was 
297 
supported by Lange and colleagues8 who found half of their participants with COPD had normal 
298 
adult lung function decline, but lower baseline lung function in early adulthood. Yet our “early below 
299 
average, accelerated decline” group carried the highest risk of COPD, and although representing only 
300 
4% of our study sample, contributed substantially to COPD cases (a population-attributable fraction 
301 
of 35·4%). These findings highlight the importance of preventing both early life adverse exposures 
302 
that may lead to poorer lung growth and adult risk factors contributing to accelerated decline.21-23   
303 
We believe we are the first to establish the early life factors determining FEV1 trajectories into the 
304 
sixth decade. Previous studies have investigated early life factors only on single phases of lung 
305 
function trajectories i.e. impaired growth24-29 or accelerated decline.30-32 Maternal smoking, allergic 
306 
diseases, and pneumonia increased the risk of the “early below average, accelerated decline” 
307 
 14 
 
trajectory. Interestingly, personal smoking and adult asthma modified the effect of maternal 
308 
smoking and childhood asthma on being in the “early below average, accelerated decline” 
309 
trajectory. A similar interaction related to smoking had been identified in other studies examining 
310 
lung function deficits33,34 and decline.32 Together, these findings suggest that maternal smoking not 
311 
only adversely affected early lung function, but predisposed children to more rapid lung function 
312 
decline if they later smoked. Expressed another way, personal smoking not only accelerated FEV1 
313 
decline but also amplified the impact of early life exposure to tobacco smoke on lung function, 
314 
possibly by preventing recovery from early acquired deficits.35 Similarly, our findings highlight the 
315 
potential role of lifelong asthma control in promoting lung health and preventing COPD. 
316 
Our “persistently low” trajectory was associated with asthma, eczema, food allergy, parental asthma 
317 
and childhood underweight. Additionally, asthma in combination with either eczema or hayfever had 
318 
a multiplicative rather than additive effect on the risk of following this trajectory. Consistent with 
319 
our findings, the MAAS and ALSPAC study (published in this issue of the journal) found that the 
320 
“persistently low” trajectory was associated with asthma/wheeze and allergic sensitization.20 
321 
Similarly, Lodrup Carlsen and colleagues reported a persistently impaired lung function pattern from 
322 
birth to 16 years in asthma with eczema and hayfever.36 These findings suggest that arresting the 
323 
atopic march, believed to drive these early allergic comorbidities, may help prevent subsequent 
324 
adverse lung function and COPD. In addition, the association between parental asthma and the 
325 
“persistently low” trajectory in our study suggests a role for genetic factors as evident in the MAAS 
326 
and ALSPAC study.17 
327 
We found that those with early low lung function tracked as either “persistently low” or “early low, 
328 
accelerated growth, normal decline”. This split of the early low lung function group is supported by 
329 
the Perth Infant Asthma Follow-up study (PIAF) published in this issue of the journal.17 While some 
330 
infants with poor lung function in the PIAF continued in the low FEV1 trajectory, the majority had 
331 
improvement in their lung function through adolescence and moved to the normal or above average 
332 
FEV1 trajectories.  Our “early low, accelerated growth, normal decline” trajectory may be related to 
333 
 15 
 
birth weight, given weight “catch-up” was reported in children with low birth weight and those with 
334 
catch-up growth showed improved lung function.37 We did not have full birth weight information to 
335 
explore this effect. However, we found that childhood underweight predicted the “early low, 
336 
accelerated growth, normal decline” and the “persistently low” trajectories. Interestingly, unlike the 
337 
“persistently low” trajectory, the association between childhood underweight and “early low, 
338 
accelerated growth, normal decline” trajectory became non-significant when controlled for weight 
339 
gain between 7 and 11 years. This suggests that childhood underweight followed by accelerated 
340 
weight gain may be related to accelerated lung growth in this group. Another difference between 
341 
these trajectories was that the “persistently low” trajectory had more than double the prevalence of 
342 
persistent childhood asthma. It is possible that while the two trajectories had similar early acquired 
343 
lung function deficits, persistent asthma prevented the catch-up in the “persistently low” trajectory.   
344 
Early below average and accelerated decline” trajectory had the highest prevalence and intensity of 
345 
smoking. Thus, this trajectory resembles the lung function pattern among “susceptible smokers” as 
346 
originally framed by Fletcher and Peto.3 While the “below average” group had similar lung function 
347 
to the “early below average, accelerated decline” group up to age 20 years, it had much lower rates 
348 
of personal smoking, which may have prevented an accelerated decline in lung function. In contrast, 
349 
the prevalence and intensity of smoking were extremely low in the three best trajectories i.e. 
350 
“persistently high”, “early low, accelerated growth, normal decline”, and “average”. These are likely 
351 
to reflect the lung function trajectories in non-smokers. 
352 
Evidence of a link between low lung function in early adulthood and prevalence and incidence of 
353 
respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic abnormalities, and all-cause mortality has been recently 
354 
reported.1,2 Our findings also support some of these associations. In addition to the significantly 
355 
higher prevalence of respiratory conditions (table 3), the three unfavourable lung function 
356 
trajectories had higher prevalences of diabetes and obstructive sleep apnoea, compared with the 
357 
average trajectory (table S7). Higher prevalences of hypertension and heart attack/myocardial 
358 
infarction were also seen for the “below average” and “persistently low” trajectories. Together, our 
359 
 16 
 
findings and others highlight the significant burden of comorbidity associated with low lung function, 
360 
and indicate the importance of early identification of this high-risk group. 
361 
Identification of lifetime lung function trajectories in a general population, their determinants and 
362 
consequences, has been a fundamental but challenging question for respiratory experts for decades. 
363 
An ideal longitudinal study with a large sample size, multiple waves of lung function measurement 
364 
spanning from early life through old age, and with perfect follow-up would fully explore this 
365 
question, but the ideal study does not exist. Most current longitudinal studies have a limited sample 
366 
sizes with limited repeated lung function measurements. To date, with its population-based design, 
367 
large sample size and long follow-up period, TAHS provides the best existing data with which to 
368 
answer this question. Over six decades, we have lung function measurements from childhood to 
369 
middle age which enable good classification of trajectories over these periods. We acknowledge that 
370 
not having sufficient lung function data around age 18 years is a key weakness which may mean that 
371 
we have missed trajectory transitions around peak lung function. However, the lack of sufficient data 
372 
at this peak lung function period would be unlikely to significantly affect trajectories in childhood 
373 
and middle age. In a sensitivity analysis, when the data point at 18 years was excluded, we still 
374 
identified six similar lung function trajectories. We encourage researchers to develop long term 
375 
studies of large birth cohorts with repeated lung function from infancy to old age to replicate our 
376 
findings and provide a more comprehensive picture of lung function over the entire life course. 
377 
However, given logistic difficulties, results from such studies would not be available for decades.   
378 
Besides the uniqueness of our data, the use of GBTM was a strength. This data driven technique 
379 
enabled us to explore potential unknown lung function trajectories which were not based on any a 
380 
priori hypotheses. Most of the identified trajectories were similar to those found in other cohorts 
381 
(Tucson, MAAS and ALSPAC). Moreover, the identified shapes and associations between risk factors 
382 
and trajectories further support their biological plausibility.  
383 
 17 
 
A limitation of this study is that GLI equations were not available in 1968 and equipment changed 
384 
over time. This could lead to an imperfect fit of GLI equations at different times, but this would have 
385 
little effect on the relative positions between trajectories. Of note, the last measurement in our 
386 
study is at an age when the burden of COPD is just starting to emerge as most patients with COPD 
387 
are diagnosed in their sixties. The effect of adverse lung function trajectories on COPD risk may 
388 
become clearer in future follow-ups of this study when COPD prevalence will be higher. 
389 
To identify trajectories from early life to the sixth decade, the analysis was restricted to those who 
390 
were alive and continuing to participate in the study at age 53; hence there is a high attrition rate. 
391 
Importantly however, the death rate for TAHS participants by age 53, was small (4.7%) and 
392 
consistent with Australian population statistics.38 Most importantly, comparisons of childhood lung 
393 
function and characteristics between participants and: those deceased and; non-participants 
394 
showed minimal differences. If attrition was differential across trajectories, it would influence the 
395 
lung function trajectory prevalence estimates and generalisability of these estimates however this 
396 
issue is unlikely to affect the patterns or the associations between these trajectories and the 
397 
predictors/outcomes observed. 
398 
Diagnosis of childhood asthma is difficult, and there is conceptual ambiguity concerning the exact 
399 
nature of asthma, which is likely to be an umbrella term for a range of conditions. Children with 
400 
abnormal lung development may present with asthma-like symptoms, while airway inflammation 
401 
associated with asthma may lead to reduced lung function. The possibility of these bidirectional 
402 
associations between poor lung development and childhood asthma has been raised39, but it 
403 
remains unclear which occurs first. Future cohort studies with lung function measured at birth and 
404 
close follow-up for asthma diagnosis may help elucidate this issue.” 
405 
Our findings have clinical and public health implications. Visual presentations of lung function 
406 
trajectory scenarios may be useful in educational programs on the dangers of smoking. Routine 
407 
spirometry measurements in school students to identify those with low lung function may help early 
408 
 18 
 
identification of high risk groups for whom early interventions such as avoidance of smoking and 
409 
hazardous occupational exposures can be implemented. Although not directly tested, our findings 
410 
raise the possibility that reducing maternal smoke exposure; encouraging immunization; and 
411 
avoiding personal smoking, especially for those with smoking parents and those with low childhood 
412 
lung function; would promote healthy lung function trajectories and lessen COPD risk. Clinicians and 
413 
patients with asthma should be made aware of the potential long-term implications of non-optimal 
414 
asthma control throughout life, and these should be investigated in future intervention trials. 
415 
CONCLUSION 
416 
This world-first characterization of lung function change from the first to the sixth decade 
417 
revealed six distinct trajectories which may represent population patterns. In our model, 
418 
most COPD, especially when more severe, was attributable to three trajectories exhibiting 
419 
lower lung function in childhood with either subsequent normal or accelerated decline. Our 
420 
findings suggest that early life factors including allergic diseases, lung infections, parental 
421 
asthma and maternal smoking influence the three unfavourable lung function trajectories. 
422 
Personal smoking may amplify the effect of maternal smoking and adult asthma may 
423 
amplify the effect of childhood asthma to determine membership of the worst lung function 
424 
trajectory.
