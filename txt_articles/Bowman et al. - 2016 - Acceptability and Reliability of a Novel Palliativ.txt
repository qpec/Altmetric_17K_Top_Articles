Abstract
Background: The Palliative Care and Rapid Emergency Screening (P-CaRES) Project is an initiative
intended to improve access to palliative care (PC) among emergency department (ED) patients with life-
limiting illness by facilitating early referral for inpatient PC consultations. In the previous two phases of
this project, we derived and validated a novel PC screening tool. This paper reports on the third and final
preimplementation phase.
Objectives: Examine the acceptability of the P-CaRES tool among PC and ED providers as well as test its
reliability on case vignettes. Compare variations in reliability and acceptability of the tool based on ED
providers’ roles (attendings, residents, and nurses) and lengths of experience.
Methods: A two-part electronic survey was distributed to ED providers at multiple sites across the United
States. We tested the reliability of the tool in the first part of the survey, through a series of case vignettes.
A criterion standard of correct responses was first defined by consensus input from expert PC physicians’
interpretations of the vignettes. The experts’ input was validated using the Gwet’s AC1 coefficient for inter-
rater reliability. ED providers were then presented with the case vignettes and asked to use the P-CaRES
tool to correctly identify which patients had unmet PC needs. ED provider responses were compared both
against the criterion standard and against different subsets of respondents (divided both by role and by
level of experience). The second part of the survey assessed acceptability of the P-CaRES tool among ED
providers using responses to questions from a modified Ottawa Acceptability of Decision Rules Instrument,
based on a 1–5 Likert rating scale. Descriptive statistics were used to report all outcomes.
Results: In total, 213 ED providers employed in three different regions across the country responded to
the survey (39.4%) and 185 (86.9%) of those completed it. The majority of providers felt that the tool
would be useful in their practice (80.5%), agreed that the tool was clear and unambiguous (87.1%),
thought that use of the tool would likely benefit patients (87.5%), and thought that it would result in
improved use of resources to help severely ill patients (83.6%). Over three-quarters of ED providers
(78.5%) also self-reported that they refer patients with unmet PC needs less than 10% of the time, and
only 10.8% of respondents believed that they are already utilizing an effective strategy to screen or refer
patients to PC. Applying our P-CaRES tool to case vignettes, ED providers generated PC referrals in
concordance with PC experts over 88.7% of the time (95% confidence interval = 86.4% to 90.6%), with an
overall sensitivity of more than 90%. These results varied minimally regardless of the respondent’s role
in the ED or their level of experience.
Conclusion: Screening by emergency medicine providers for unmet PC needs using a brief, novel,
content-validated screening tool is acceptable and is also reliable when applied to case vignettes—
regardless of provider role or experience. Clinical trial and further study are warranted and are currently
under way.

 A
dvances in diagnostic and therapeutic medicine
have changed not only how we live but also
how we die. Chronic diseases are now the lead-
ing cause of death in the United States.1 Roughly half of
all elderly patients make at least one emergency depart-
ment (ED) visit in the last month of life, and three-quar-
ters
of
these
visits
result
in
hospital
admissions.2
Despite numerous interactions with hospital providers,
many patients with life-limiting illness continue to suffer
from
poorly
addressed
physical,
psychological,
and
social symptoms.3 For these patients, hospitalization
often leads to additional invasive interventions or thera-
pies, which are sometimes minimally effective and fre-
quently incongruent with patient and caregiver wishes.4
The field of palliative care (PC) began in the United
States several decades ago and has evolved into a for-
malized medical specialty that focuses on optimizing
patients’ quality of life throughout the illness spectrum
(particularly with life-limiting illness) by anticipating,
preventing, and treating suffering of all kinds. Research
has demonstrated clear benefits of PC consultation for
those with life-limiting illnesses.4–9 PC has been shown
to reduce symptoms and improve outcomes in both
patients and caregivers, as well as reduce resource use
and cost.10–13
While PC services have rapidly expanded over the
past decade and are now available at the majority of
hospitals with over 50 beds, there is a high prevalence
of unmet PC needs among ED patients.14–17 For the
minority of patients who do ultimately receive a PC
referral, there is typically a long latency between hospi-
tal admission and PC referral.18 This time is often char-
acterized
by
unnecessary
suffering
and
increased
resource utilization.19–21
Why Screen for PC in the ED?
In their 2013 “Choosing Wisely” campaign, The Ameri-
can College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) recom-
mended
that
ED
providers
“Don’t
delay
engaging
available palliative and hospice care services in the
emergency department for patients likely to benefit.”22
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) have also
called for the integration of ED and PC care to help bet-
ter meet the needs of patients who have advanced ill-
ness.23,24
Screening for PC in the ED is more important today
than ever, as many patients with PC needs are not
receiving a referral from their primary care provider or
medical specialists.16,17 In a recent RAND study, pri-
mary care physicians and specialists confirmed that
they are increasingly relying on EDs to evaluate com-
plex patients with potentially serious health problems,
rather than managing these patients themselves.25
Objectives
In an attempt to improve access to PC by ED patients,
we developed the Palliative Care and Rapid Emergency
Screening (P-CaRES) Project—a multiphase project to
create, validate, and implement a brief screening tool
that can help facilitate early referral for inpatient PC
consultation.
The
project
was
designed
using
an
evidenced-based
framework,
including
three
preimplementation phases. In Phase I, the derivation
phase, a critical review of the literature was conducted
to develop the P-CaRES tool. In Phase II, the internal
validation phase, we utilized a modified Delphi tech-
nique to ascertain the content validity of the P-CaRES
tool among a group of content experts.26
This study represents the third and final preimple-
mentation phase (Phase III) of our project and includes
various assessments of the P-CaRES tool including
external reliability compared with PC experts, inter-
rater reliability (IRR) of the tool among ED providers,
and the acceptability of the screening tool among ED
providers.
We hypothesize 1) that ED providers applying the
P-CaRES tool to our case vignettes will recommend PC
consultation
in
high
concordance
with
PC
experts’
opinions and 2) that reliability and acceptability of the
P-CaRES tool will be high among all ED providers—
regardless of provider role or experience level.
METHODS
This study was a multisite survey of health care provi-
ders conducted from August 2014 to December 2014.
Online surveys were distributed to participants via an
online survey tool (Wufoo). This study was granted
exempt status from the Lifespan Hospital Institutional
Review Board.
Site Selection and Statistics
Six hospitals across three different regions in the United
States were selected for survey distribution. All six sites
were academically affiliated hospitals but had consider-
able variability in geographic location, patient popula-
tion, and size of inpatient PC services. One site was a
community-academic hospital, two were large public
urban-academic hospitals, and three were private aca-
demic centers. Hospital sizes ranged from 240 to 750
beds. ED censuses ranged from 30,000 to 140,000 ED
visits per year.
While each of the six participating hospital sites had
a hospital-based inpatient PC consult service, none had
dedicated ED-based PC services. Nationally, approxi-
mately 69% (1,658) of hospitals have PC services avail-
able while 31% (735) do not. Alternatively, PC programs
exist in 67% (1,591) of hospitals with over 50 inpatient
bed and 91% (728) of hospitals with over 300 beds.27
The average monthly PC service consult census in the
six participating hospital sites ranged from 18 to 93
patients.
While
official
numbers
were
unavailable,
administrators at each site reported that their inpatient
PC consults originated almost entirely from hospital
wards or intensive care unit services, with a negligible
number of PC consults (less than 10 over a 6-month
period) initiated from an ED.
Survey Participants
Participants were included if they were a registered
nurse (RN), nurse practitioner (NP), physician assistant
(PA), resident physician (MD/DO), or attending physi-
cian (MD/DO) currently practicing in an adult ED.
Participants were required to have 2 or more years of
clinical experience in an adult ED. First- and second-

 year residents were thus excluded because they were
considered not to have sufficient knowledge of clinical
emergency medicine (EM) to have relatively stable and
informed clinical opinions. Similarly, NPs, PAs, and RNs
with less than 2 years of experience in an ED were
excluded. Pediatric EM providers were also excluded
because the P-CaRES tool has not been validated for
use with pediatric patients. Invitees received an e-mail
invitation with a brief explanation of the project, time
commitment, and risks. Participation was completely
voluntary and confidential. A $10 gift card was offered
to participants who completed the survey.
Survey Development, Sample Size, and Distribution
The survey was composed of two parts. The first part
contained five case vignettes (see last paragraph in this
section, below). ED providers were instructed to read
each case and then apply the P-CaRES tool. The second
part of the survey assessed the ED providers’ current
practice patterns in terms of PC referrals and the
degree of acceptability of the P-CaRES tool. This second
part also collected demographic information including
practice site, type of provider (MD/DO, RN, etc.), and
years in practice (2–5, 5–10, >10).
Investigators developed 10 hypothetical case vign-
ettes to test the P-CaRES tool. Each vignette reflected
a “typical” ED patient encounter. The vignettes were
specifically designed to include a wide range of both
life-limiting
illnesses
(not
just
malignancy)
and
PC
needs (physical, psychosocial, etc.) so that we could
assess the reliability of the tool for a broad spectrum
of patients.
The case vignettes were each first piloted among
independent health providers including a PC-trained
physician,
a
PC-trained
NP,
two
emergency-trained
physicians, and an emergency RN. Pilot testers were
given the P-CaRES tool and asked to complete the
screening tool based on the vignettes. Results were then
compared. Modifications were made to each of the 10
cases until all five providers reached consensus on the
clarity and interpretation of the vignettes, as well as the
correct completion of the P-CaRES tool for each case.
The final 10 cases that were used are included as an
appendix to this paper (Data Supplement S1, available
as supporting information in the online version of this
paper). Of note, no modifications were made to any case
vignette or to the survey after this initial development
phase.
It was determined for the study’s sample population
of 541 providers that at least 180 respondents would be
necessary to maintain the chosen confidence level of
90% and margin of error of 5%. (A confidence level of
95% and margin of error of 5% would have required
225 people, and there was concern at being able to
afford providing the $10 gift card incentive to more
than 200 people.)
To avoid participant fatigue, each of the 213 EM pro-
vider respondents was only asked to interpret five of 10
case vignettes. Respondents from each hospital site
were block randomized; the first half of participants at a
site to respond received a survey linked to cases 1–5,
and the second half of participants at the site received a
survey linked to cases 6–10. The order of the links was
switched across institutions to avoid early and late
response bias. Data from all 10 cases were aggregated
for analysis.
External Validity
Currently,
the
“criterion
standard”
indication
for
a
referral to PC is the expert opinion of PC clinicians.
Therefore, in this study we used PC clinicians as the cri-
terion standard against which we could compare the
efficacy of the P-CaRES tool, as applied to our case
vignettes.
Eleven PC experts were contacted and asked to serve
as volunteers to independently review the case vign-
ettes. We defined PC experts as having a minimum of
3 years of clinical experience as a PC clinician and/or as
holding a position as either a faculty educator in PC or
a clinician-researcher in PC (as determined by publica-
tion of one or more PC-themed, peer-reviewed articles).
Efforts were made to select experts from geographically
diverse regions of the country, as well as multiple differ-
ent
hospital
systems
and
administrative
structures.
Seven of the 11 invitees agreed to participate in the sur-
vey, and all seven completed the survey.
The 10 vignettes were distributed to each of the seven
participating PC experts, who were blinded to each
other’s responses. They were asked to read each case
and respond either “yes” or “no” as to whether the
patient described in the case was appropriate for inpa-
tient PC consultation.
We computed the inter-rater reliability (IRR) of their
responses using the newer Gwet’s AC1 method. The
Gwet method was developed in 2001 and is similar to
the widely used Fleiss method but attempts to address
several of the latter’s possible sources of error. We
chose an IRR cutoff of Gwet’s AC1 = 0.8 from the start,
before conducting any analysis, because values equal to
or greater than 0.8 are considered by experts to indicate
“substantial” or “almost perfect” agreement or “very
good agreement beyond chance.”28–31
Overall level of agreement of the PC experts for the
case vignettes was high, both grossly and as calculated
by Gwet’s AC1. Among the 10 case vignettes, experts
unanimously agreed (Gwet’s AC1 of 1.00) that a PC con-
sult would be appropriate in six of them. In the other
four case vignettes, six of seven experts agreed (Gwet’s
AC1 of 0.88). Thus, all 10 case vignettes were kept and
sent to respondents. PC expert responses are available
in Data Supplement S2 (available as supporting infor-
mation in the online version of this paper). Case vign-
ettes are available in Data Supplement S1.
Attitudes and Acceptability
Acceptability of the P-CaRES tool among ED providers
was assessed in the second part of the survey by mea-
suring responses to questions from a modified Ottawa
Acceptability of Decision Rules Instrument (OADRI) on
a 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, neutral,
disagree, strongly disagree). The OADRI is a previously
validated test that is used to assess the acceptability of a
decision tool among health care providers.32
We made an a priori decision to use seven of the
original 12 OARDI items. We were unable to use the
other five questions because they require participants to
696
Bowman et al. • NOVEL PALLIATIVE CARE SCREENING TOOL IN THE ED
 have preexisting knowledge of the evidence supporting
the screening tool or previous experience using the
screening tool. Neither of these conditions were possi-
ble at the time of the survey since this is a novel tool
that has never before been used. Importantly, the five
questions we had to eliminate were evenly distributed
among the original instrument’s eight supportive and
five “reversed” (or “critical”) questions. While use of all
12 original OARDI items is required for computation of
an “acceptability score,” we instead used the OARDI for
its secondary purpose: “analysis of individual items [to]
allow identification of specific barriers to rule accept-
ability.”
The original and modified OADRI instruments are
available in Data Supplement S3 (available as support-
ing information in the online version of this paper). It
was decided from the onset of the project that the P-
CaRES tool would be deemed to be sufficiently accept-
able if >80% of providers endorsed agreement or strong
agreement with at least three of our seven OADRI
items.
Data Analysis
Inter-rater reliability was calculated for the seven PC
experts in their interpretations of the 10 case vignettes.
Percent agreement of ED respondents compared to the
PC expert criterion standard was also computed, along
with the sensitivity and specificity of the P-CaRES tool.
Each of these values was calculated for all EM providers
and then further broken down by respondents’ roles in
the ED and years in practice. Confidence intervals (CIs;
95%) for each value were included. Finally, the percent
of ED provider respondents (overall and by role) who
agreed
or
disagreed
with
each
OADRI
item
was
computed.
A respondent was deemed to have generated a “posi-
tive” screening for a case vignette if they identified one
or more life-limiting illnesses as well as unmet PC needs
in the case’s patient, using the P-CaRES tool. This
threshold for positive screening was determined by the
PC experts who evaluated the tool during the content
validation phase of this project. The effect of requiring
“one or more unmet PC needs” (P-CaRES ≥ 1) versus
“two or more unmet PC needs” (P-CaRES ≥ 2) was also
examined.
RESULTS
Response and Completion Rates
In total, 541 ED providers across six institutions in three
geographically diverse regions received an e-mail invi-
tation to participate in the survey. Respondents were
relatively evenly distributed across the six sites. Details
of
the
participants’
demographics
are
available
in
Table 1. The overall response rate to the survey was 213
(39.4%), and 185 (34.2%) of the invitees completed it—
meeting
the
target
sample
size
of
180.
(Details
of
response and completion rates by provider type are
available in Data Supplement S4, available as support-
ing information in the online version of this paper.)
Of those who did respond, 86.9% actually completed
the survey. A survey was considered incomplete if the
participant quit prior to completing at least three of the
five case vignettes. The percentage of respondents who
answered each vignette is summarized in Table 2. As
expected, completion rate decreased from Case 1 to
Case 5 and from Case 6 to Case 10—likely due to provi-
ders being interrupted by other obligations or interests.
It is important to note that the “complex” questions (4
and 8) had response rates similar to the means for each
set of five cases. Case 4 had a response rate of 92.3%
(mean response rate for cases 1 through 5 was 92.5%)
while case 8 had a response rate of 95.7 (mean response
rate for cases 6 through 10 was 95.1%). Thus, there is
no evidence that the challenging cases were left undone
with increased frequency, which could have led to artifi-
cial inflation of the P-CaRES tool’s reliability.

 Accuracy
When ED providers used the P-CaRES tool they cor-
rectly recommended a PC consult, as defined by the PC
expert
panel,
in
88.7%
of
the
cases
overall
(95%
CI = 86.4% to 90.6%; Table 3). Rates of success in using
the tool were similar regardless of provider role or level
of experience. The sensitivity of the tool across all provi-
ders was 98.0% (95% CI to 96.6% to 98.9%) when one
or more unmet PC needs was required and 93.2% (95%
CI = 91.0% to 94.9%) when this was changed to two or
more (Table 4). The specificity across all providers was
51.4% (95% CI = 43.9% to 58.9%) for one or more and
71.8% (95% CI = 63.8% to 77.6%) for two or more.
Finally, respondents were able to successfully use the
tool to correctly recommend a PC consult across all
types of life-limiting illness depicted in the case vign-
ettes, not just malignancy (Table 5).
Acceptability
In terms of current practice patterns, the majority of
providers (78.5%) reported that they rarely (less than
10% of the time) or never screen refer patients who
have a life-limiting illness for PC consultation (Table 4).
Fewer than 11% of providers felt that they were already
using an effective strategy to make PC referrals consul-
tation from the ED. In contrast, 80.5% of respondents
felt that the tool would be useful in their practice. A
total of 87.5% agreed that use of the tool would benefit
patients, and 83.6% agreed that use of the tool would
improve resource utilization.
Importantly, 87.1% of providers felt that the tool
was clear and easy to use, and less than 10% felt that
the tool failed to account for important clinical factors
necessary for screening. Only 35.4% of respondents
worried that it could be difficult to use the P-CaRES
tool in their current workplace, while 32.1% of provi-
ders
expressed
ambivalence
about
how
their
col-
leagues
might
react
to
use
of
the
tool.
Among
provider types, residents were the most supportive of
the tool and least concerned about barriers, although
variation across provider types was narrow. Complete
results
of
modified
OADRI
survey
are
available
in
Table 6.
Attitudes
Most respondents (90.4%) agreed that a validated PC
screening tool would improve their ability to refer to PC,
and 81.2% agreed that PC screening was an important
component of evaluating patients with advanced illness.
Yet over half (56.7%) said they had not received adequate
training on how to independently screen for PC needs.
Nearly
two-thirds
(62.9%)
of
providers
agreed
or
strongly agreed that they would use the P-CaRES tool in
their practice, while 24.5% were neutral. The majority of
respondents (86.9%) agreed or strongly agreed that they
would like the patients they screen positive for PC needs
to receive a prompt PC consult once admitted (see
Table 7
for
complete
details
on
provider
attitudes
reported regarding the P-CaRES tool).
DISCUSSION
Despite the tremendous benefits of PC, and the accept-
ability of PC among both patients and their families, the
vast majority of patients who could benefit from PC are
never identified or referred.33 Additionally, this gap in
care is not symmetrically distributed across illness types
or patient populations. Access to PC is often severely
limited among the medically underserved, and there are
significant racial and ethnic disparities in PC and hos-
pice referral.34–38 Screening for unmet PC needs in the
ED could help to change this.
Respondents in our study self-reported low levels of
referral for inpatient PC consultation. Data from the PC
consult services at each institution corroborated this,
with each institution reporting that negligible numbers of
PC consults are placed from the ED. While ED providers
readily admitted that they are not making these referrals,
they also recognized the importance of PC screening and
referral and agreed that there are at present a lack of
tools and resources available to help them efficiently and
accurately make PC referrals. The P-CaRES tool was
highly acceptable among participants.
Against this backdrop, we tested our hypothesis that
a brief ED provider-based PC screening tool is reliable
and acceptable among ED health providers in pilot test-
ing. We subsequently demonstrated a high degree of

Furthermore, while advanced cancer is readily identi-
fiable as a life-limiting illness and frequently associated
with need for palliation, we wanted to ensure that the
tool that would help providers identify all patients with
PC needs, including those with heart failure, respiratory
failure, kidney failure, etc. To test this, we included these
illnesses in many of the vignettes and found that provi-
ders were able to successfully utilize the tool in most
patient types with minimal variability. Concordance with
experts was lowest in the case of stable CHF as described
in Case 8 (Data Supplement S1). In this case, the patient
was described as having symptoms consistent with New
York Heart Association Class II Heart Failure. The PC
experts did not recommend PC consult for this patient;
however, 71.0% ED providers incorrectly did.
At 93.2% to 98.0%, the sensitivity of the P-CaRES tool
in this preimplementation setting is in keeping with that
of other commonly adopted clinical screening tools for
EM, such as the Ottawa Ankle Rules.39 However, since
PC consultation is more resource intensive than an
ankle x-ray, we recommend that administrators adapt
the threshold for a positive screening (i.e., “one”, “two”,
or “more than two unaddressed PC needs”) depending
on the capacity of their PC team. For instance, a hospi-
tal with a PC team that has a higher capacity for consul-
tations may choose to use “P-CaRES greater or equal to
1” as their threshold for referral to PC. Conversely, a
hospital with a smaller PC team and more limited
patient capacity may choose a higher threshold for
referral.
The four cases where one PC expert disagreed with
the other six (including in both “negative” case vignettes)
and instances where EM providers wanted a PC consult
despite a negative screen are also reminders that there is
as of yet no true criterion standard when it comes to PC
screening and projections—even among experts.
LIMITATIONS
Our low response rate limited the diversity of providers
and practice types represented in our study. Included
hospitals were all academic and urban hospitals, some-
what limiting the diversity of hospital setting. However,
we did include both public and private hospitals, and
each of them varied in the size and availability of PC.
Historically, studies with lower response rate have
been associated with increased risk of “response bias.”
However, at least six studies to date have shown that
response bias may be of less concern for physician sur-
veys than surveys with the general population, as most
nonresponse studies have found no or only minimal
amounts of response bias. Alternatively, several studies
with physicians have shown that higher response rates
are not associated with lower response bias.40
It is important to note that, while low response rates
are a common issue with e-surveys, the response rate in
our study may be artificially low. All of the nurses on
the utilized administrative listservs received our invita-
tion e-mail, which instructed providers who did not
have at least 2 years of full-time ED experience to not
participate. This likely disqualified a great many of the
RNs who received the invitation e-mail, resulting in
their 22.3% response rate - lower than the rate for
attendings and for residents.

 Our case vignettes are hypothetical and do not repre-
sent real patient cases, nor were they adapted directly
from them. Development of the cases may have been
skewed to reflect the language of the screening tool,
thereby making it easier to positively identify screening
tool criteria and limiting the true validity of the tool.
The fact that this was a PC study may also have made
respondents more likely to look for and identify unmet
PC needs for patients in each case scenario. This also
may explain why many providers still wanted PC con-
sults for case vignettes 4 and 8 (the negative cases, with
patients who did not require PC consults). These false-
positives may have contributed to the lower specificity
of the test.
No method used to compute IRR is perfect. The Gwet
AC1 method does address several of the documented
problems with prior methods—particularly in cases of
nonhomogenously distributed responses such as with
our expert panel in this study (when six or seven out of
seven experts voted the same way)—and has been
favorably described in both statistical and medical liter-
ature. However, it is several decades newer than older
methods such as Cohen’s kappa and Fleiss’ kappa and
not yet as well studied.
Finally, it is also possible that those who took the time
to respond did so because they already had an interest
or experience in PC topics, which may have increased
their ability to correctly identify patients with PC needs
(known as “response bias”). However, respondents to
our survey were far from homogenous in their support
for our tool or for PC screening in general, and the vast
majority did not feel they had received adequate train-
ing in screening for and identifying need. Despite this,
they were still able to use our tool on the case scenarios
with a high level of success.
If response bias does exist in the study, the authors
feel that it is most likely due to the higher percentage of
residents who responded (52%, vs. 32% of attendings).
Overall, residents’ acceptability and attitudes responses,
and success with the P-CaRES tool were higher than
the attendings’. Some of the possible explanations for
this include that the relative value of the $10 gift certifi-
cate was perceived as higher among this group, that
they had increased familiarity with online survey for-
mats and technology, or that they were more interested
in supporting resident-driven research.
CONCLUSION
Screening by emergency medicine providers for unmet
palliative care needs using a brief, novel, content-vali-
dated screening tool is acceptable and is also reliable
when applied to case vignettes—regardless of provider
role or experience. Clinical trial and further study are
warranted and are currently under way.
