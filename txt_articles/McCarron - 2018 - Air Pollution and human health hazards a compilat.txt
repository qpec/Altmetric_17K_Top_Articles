Air Pollution and human health hazards: a compilation of air

Darling Downs

ABSTRACT
The paper offers an attempt to determine whether emissions from 
the unconventional gas industry are associated with hospitalisations 
in the Darling Downs, Queensland, Australia. Hospitalisation data 
were obtained from the Darling Downs Hospital and Health Services 
(DDHHS) and Coal Seam Gas (CSG) emissions data from the National 
Pollutants Inventory (NPI). Hospital admissions for circulatory and 
respiratory conditions, controlled for population, increased significantly 
from 2007 to 2014 (p < 0.001). Acute circulatory admissions increased 
133% (2198–5141) and acute respiratory admissions increased 142% 
(1257–3051). CSG emissions increased substantially over the same 
period: nitrogen oxides (489% to 10,048 tonnes), carbon monoxide 
(800% to 6800 tonnes), PM10 (6000% to 1926 tonnes), volatile 
organic compounds (337% to 670 tonnes) and formaldehyde (12 kg 
to over 160 tonnes). Increased cardiopulmonary hospitalisations are 
coincident with the rise in pollutants known to cause such symptoms. 
Apparently, controls to limit exposure are ineffectual. The burden of air 
pollution from the gas industry on the wellbeing of the Darling Downs 
population is a significant public health concern.
Introduction
The Darling Downs (Figure 1) west of the Great Dividing Range in Southern Queensland, 
Australia has long been noted for its robust, diversified agricultural industry and natural 
beauty [1]. The Darling Downs Hospital and Health Service (DDHHS) covers an area of 
approximately 90,000 sq km with catchment population ca. 277,000 [2]. There has been 
rapid development of the resources industry (CSG, underground gasification, coal), super-
imposed on pre-existing rural, farming and small town communities in the area now often 
known by its geological name, ‘the Surat Basin’
.
Outdoor air pollution, especially in an industrial context, has demonstrated mul-
tiple negative human health effects [3]. Air pollution increases risks for a wide range 
of diseases including respiratory [4] and cardiac [5,6], and is a leading environmental

cause of cancer deaths [7]. Some effects are long-term and causation can be difficult 
to prove. For instance, a heart attack or stroke resulting from exposure during a day of 
high ambient PM concentration may be a consequence of chronic disease progression 
associated with long-term exposure [8]. Emissions acknowledged by the CSG industry 
can be linked to both acute and chronic health effects (see Table 1, summary of air 
toxins/related health effects).
The unchecked expansion of unconventional gas companies into what was previously an 
agrarian area of the Darling Downs has led to the generation of extra emissions attributable 
to a single industry.

Concurrent with the rapidly expanding CSG developments, residents in Queensland’s 
Darling Downs reported impairments to their health [23,24]. As acknowledged by the 
Darling Downs Public Health Unit (DDPHU) health impacts associated with Coal Seam 
Gas have been a major community concern. Since 2008 DDPHU has received a variety 
of health complaints related to this industry (including headaches, sore eyes, nosebleeds, 
rashes, respiratory symptoms, paraesthesia) [25].
Yet there has been a remarkable lack of substantive investigation into potential human 
health impacts of the CSG industry in the Darling Downs. No baseline environmental 
studies, human health risk assessments or health studies were undertaken before large-scale 
extraction took place. State-based research organizations expected to be active in the space 
have disclosed little research investigating the possible physical health impacts of uncon-
ventional gas emissions. The significant 2010 Australian Research Council linkage project 
‘
A Human Health Risk Assessment for developing CSG water resources in Queensland’ [26] 
was not pursued, purportedly because the industry partner, Santos, withdrew funding. A 
notable exception is the work of Werner et al. [27] reviewing hospitalisation data up to 2011 
for 3 areas in Queensland, with the finding that certain hospital admissions rates (neoplasms 
and blood/immune diseases) increased more quickly in the CSG area than the other study 
areas, after adjusting for key sociodemographic factors. In other jurisdictions, specifically the 
USA, increased rate and severity of asthma attacks [28], increased hospitalisation [29] for 
asthma, cardiac, neurological and skin conditions, increased incidence of congenital heart 
defects [30], childhood leukaemia [31], low birth weight [32], and early infant death [33] 
correlated with the presence of the unconventional gas industry. International researchers 
have documented significant declines in air quality correlating with gas industry activities 
[34–36].
Despite appeals from health professionals to improve oversight, state and federal regu-
latory bodies have failed to act. In 2013 the Australian Medical Association (AMA) issued 
a policy statement warning: ‘Despite the rapid expansion of CSG developments, the health 
impacts have not been adequately researched, and effective regulations that protect public 
health are not in place’ [37]. In 2013 also, the Queensland Government undertook a limited 
investigation into health complaints of Darling Downs residents [38]. The report, while 
unable to determine whether reported health effects were clearly linked to exposure to CSG 
pollutants, acknowledged that there was ‘some evidence that might associate some of the 
residents’ symptoms to exposure to airborne contaminants arising from CSG activities.’ The 
critical recommendation from Queensland Health was that the regulator, the Department 
of the Environment and Heritage Protection (DEHP) monitor overall CSG emissions and 
the exposure of local communities to those emissions. DEHP acknowledged that they did 
not have access to data to allow for comparisons to the air quality objectives set out in the 
Environmental Protection Policy (EPP) (Air) to protect environmental values (including 
health and wellbeing). Despite this, DEHP determined that they found no cause to expand 
monitoring, thereby blocking Queensland Health’s recommendation that overall gasfield 
emissions and the exposure of the community to those emissions be monitored [39]. The 
rejection by the regulator of these recommendations is of serious concern.
The anecdotal reports of health effects related to CSG industry activity [23], coupled 
with the dearth of available research in the Australian context, motivated this investigation. 
This paper seeks to compile available reported emissions from CSG installations in the 
Darling Downs area and determine whether such activity is coincident with an increase in

acute health effects. It brings together data on air pollutants as reported by the industry to 
the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) [40], population data from the Australian Bureau 
of Statistics (ABS) and hospitalisation data from the Darling Downs Hospital and Health 
Services (DDHHS).
Method
Population data
Estimated resident population by local government area (LGA), Queensland, 2007–2014 
(Queensland Government Statistician’s Office) was sourced from ABS 3218.0, Regional 
Population Growth, Australia, 2015–2016 and Queensland Treasury estimates where 
Geographies were based on the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography 
Standard (ASGS) [41].
Air toxics data
Reported emissions to air were obtained from the Commonwealth Department of the 
Environment’s National Pollutant Inventory Website [40]. Above a defined threshold, the 
Australian Government requires polluting industries to self-report to the NPI their calcu-
lated, estimated emissions of 93 toxic substances, identified as important owing to their 
possible effect on human health and the environment.
Hospital admission data
Inpatient admissions were obtained for DDHHS and South West residents treated within all 
acute public hospital facilities interfaced to the Transition 11 clinical benchmarking system. 
This included all Activity Based Funding (ABF) facilities and the majority of satellite facilities 
within each HHS, but excluded the Brisbane Mater Adult, Mothers and Children’s Hospitals. 
Hospitalisation of residents from South West has been separated from the main DDHHS 
data, as with such a large, sparsely populated area (310,000 km2, population approximately 
26,000) it is difficult to draw inferences regarding activity and effects. Data on hospital 
admissions were provided by DDHHS for the years 2006–2015. Data for 2006 were partial 
(01/07/06 to 31/12/06) and data for 2015 was also incomplete (01/01/15 to 18/08/15) and 
were excluded.
Statistical analysis
Acute hospital admission data (circulatory and respiratory) were controlled for population 
increases in the DDHHS catchment. Linear regression analysis was performed using SPSS.
Results
In the DDHHS region, in 2015 there were 3521 registered births and 2353 registered deaths. 
In 2011, 2.4% of the population (2763) in the region was employed in mining.1 Statistics 
from the ABS indicate population increase from 252,785 to 276,723 [41]. The region with

Limitations
There are limitations to the data available for consideration. For instance it was not possible 
to break down admissions into demographics (age/gender) and times/dates of admission. 
Factors for which data are unavailable are the change, if any, in the population rates of cig-
arette smoking and obesity, and the prior health status of residents who may have moved 
into (and out of) the area between 2007 and 2014. The contribution to ill health of viral 
epidemics is unknown (e.g. swine flu 2009, but the expected peak and return to baseline in 
the following year did not occur (Table 2).
NPI reporting of emissions is annual, with no data available on times/dates/durations of 
peak emissions, and no data available on the prevailing weather conditions. The difficulty 
in correlating lower volume pollutants to chronic (cancer, neurodevelopmental) health 
conditions is recognised, hence the need to rely on high volume pollutants and acute health 
effects. An assessment of the cumulative load of air toxins such as phenol, n-hexane, PAHs

and heavy metals was impossible as reporting was inconsistent. Other resource develop-
ments (coal/underground gasification), and possible changes in agricultural practices have 
not been studied.
It is also notable that the gross emission values provided by the NPI are industries’ esti-
mates of their releases to air. As these are total annual estimates, it is impossible to calculate 
the resulting concentration of pollutants, either individually or combined in the airshed at 
any given time with any confidence. Nor can the results be used to compare air emissions 
against any relevant national or state air quality guidelines or standards, given as concentra-
tions. Estimates of the aggregate pollutant load and concentration do not capture spatial or 
temporal conditions, which may lead to dangerous exposure and therefore acute or chronic 
health effects (point emission, low air temperature, etc. See below).
Discussion
There are noted anomalies in the industry NPI data. In 2008/2009 across all Arrow projects, 
there was detailed reporting of a wide range of toxins, yet many were not reported previ-
ously or since. During that year, levels of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen were 
significantly higher than recorded in the preceding/following year. No explanation is appar-
ent. After 2009/2010 several projects across the Darling Downs and South West no longer 
reported benzene, though previously reporting significant volumes. Despite undertaking 
comparable activities, Santos consistently failed to report formaldehyde emissions while 
QGC reported up to 219 tonnes per year. Although reporting is a statutory requirement, 
data are self-calculated (estimated, not measured) and are not reported below a threshold. 
It is difficult to know how such reporting could be audited. It is plausible that emissions 
have been substantially underestimated.
Emissions reported by the CSG industry to the NPI have escalated since expansion of 
CSG from 2006 onwards. Toxins include particulate matter with over 6,000% increase in 
reported emissions of PM10 between the years of 2006/2007 and 2013/2014 (29.19–1926.9 
tonnes). Reported emissions of PM2.5 increased from zero to 301 tonnes. Emissions of 
oxides of nitrogen increased by 489%, (1704–10048 tonnes) VOCs by 337%, (153.4–670.6 
tonnes) CO by 801%, (754–6,800 tonnes) SO2 by more than 1000% (1.14–12.97 tonnes) 
and, remarkably emissions of the known carcinogen formaldehyde increased from 12 kg to 
160.42 tonnes over the same time period. Further escalation in emissions is noted in the 
reporting periods 2014/2015, and 2015/2016 (Table 3).
Between the years of 2007 and 2014, hospitalisations of DDHHS patients for respiratory 
conditions increased by 142%, and hospitalisations for circulatory conditions increased 
by 133%. Hospitalisations from DDHHS areas fluctuated between 2007 and 2010 with 
significant rates of change apparent in 2010/2011 (circulatory conditions increased 32%, 
respiratory conditions 42%) and 2011/2012 (circulatory conditions increased 27%, respira-
tory conditions 18%). Increases were evident across all DDHHS areas including areas rela-
tively distant from intense gas field industrialisation such as Goondiwindi and Inglewood. 
Interpretation of individual changes in these very low population centres is made more 
difficult by the number of drive in/drive out gasfield workers from across the Darling Downs.
Changes are not explicable by the modest population increase of 9.46% during the same 
time period, or the change in median age, which over the longer time frame of 2005–2015 
increased by 2.4 years. They do however give weight to the community’s perception that 
 180

there has been an adverse change in their health status. It is noted that these changes were 
not commented on in the Queensland Government 2013 CSG investigation. This may relate 
to the limits of their terms of reference and/or lag time with data compilation.
There is international acknowledgement of the serious adverse impacts on human health 
of air pollution in general, and the toxicity of the specific air pollutants reported by the 
gas industry to the NPI (see Table 1, summary of air toxins/related health effects). Many 
families, including young children are, for up to 24 h a day, living, breathing and sleeping 
in the midst of point emission sources in Queensland’s gasfields. They are exposed to acute 
peaks and chronic, lower concentrations of mixtures of harmful chemicals. Air dispersion 
throughout the regional airshed means the broader population is likely to be repeatedly 
exposed to lower doses of the same toxins.
Although the quantity of emitted pollutants is notionally ‘within guidelines,’ there does 
not appear to be a level of emissions unacceptable to industry or the regulator. Former 
Queensland Premier Campbell Newman stated: ‘Emission limits are not prescribed for each 
gas well or the broader reticulation system but rather, emissions from this infrastructure 
must not cause nuisance or environmental harm’ (Letter from The Hon. Campbell Newman, 
Premier of Queensland, to Dr McCarron, 7th November 2012).
Currently, production facilities act with the assumption that emitted pollutants will be 
dispersed in the surrounding airshed to ‘safe’ levels (Dilution is assumed to be the solution 
to pollution) [42].
Since there is an unexplained rise in hospitalisations for health conditions associated with 
exposure to CSG emissions coincident with the expansion of the industry, it is questiona-
ble whether this management strategy is effective. Such a method for the neutralisation of 
harmful wastes largely ignores local environmental effects: large-volume point emissions, 
wind strength/direction and day/night temperature differences which could lead to adverse 
levels of exposure.
Australia has National Air Quality Standards with defined maximum limits for the afore-
mentioned pollutants (CO, NO2, Ozone, SO2, Lead, PM10) over specified averaging periods 
[43]. Yet without real-time 24 h monitoring, there is no way to know whether such standards 
have been exceeded. Additionally, deleterious health effects have been noted to occur at 
levels below current air quality guidelines, and for many pollutants it is not clear whether 
a safe threshold exists [3]. The Queensland Government has an ambient air-monitoring 
network [44], but before February 2015 there was not a single air monitoring station sited 
in the expanding gas fields, with no station west of Jondaryan (see Figure 3, operated March 
2014–Aug 2016). Air monitoring has been infrequent, ad hoc, episodic and reactive [45]. 
Often, air monitoring did not occur until weeks after the local community reported extreme 
pollution events such as intense flaring. Monitoring and reporting practices for air qual-
ity appear inadequate to protect public health [46]. Drinkwater (2015) noted the limited 
monitoring data received through the RTI process, and queried whether there is a shortfall 
in the process or whether monitoring data simply do not exist [47]. Both considerations 
point to regulatory failure.
In this study the limitations of reporting requirements to the NPI were such that it was 
not possible to calculate the cumulative load of low volume highly toxic pollutants (phenol, 
PAH, BETX, heavy metals, etc.). Nevertheless, the need to monitor and restrict emissions of 
such pollutants is critically important, as they may be associated with future chronic health 
conditions, including cancer [48] and neurodevelopmental abnormalities [49].

DDHHS hospitalisation data for acute respiratory and circulatory conditions appear 
consistent with short-term health impacts of air pollution. Of concern is the future health 
of a population subject to chronic exposure. Long-term, real-time 24-h exposure moni-
toring to capture the temporal and spatial variability of a wide range of key environmen-
tal toxins is necessary to assess exposure. Average ambient levels do not give an adequate 
assessment of the health risks to vulnerable subgroups of the population [50]. This applies 
particularly to children, pregnant women, the ill, including those with pre-existing car-
diac and respiratory disease, and the elderly. It applies to those living in close proximity 
to infrastructure, who are exposed to spikes of multiple air toxins, with increased risks on 
still nights during temperature inversions. These are the populations also at most risk to 
high volume pollutants. Children, with their high ventilation rates per body weight and 
increased activity and play outdoors, are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of 
air pollution [51]. When exposed to mixtures of toxic chemicals they have heightened risk 
because of the immaturity of their immune and metabolic responses and their potential 
to live long enough for latent illnesses to develop [52]. It is increasingly recognised that 
even current air standards properly applied provide suboptimal protection for the most 
vulnerable in our society. Monitoring by the regulatory bodies has been ineffectual and 
inadequate to protect public health. Over the past decade, an unmistakeable and significant 
change in the life of residents of the Darling Downs has related to the arrival and activities 
of the CSG industry. There has been an escalation in health impairment correlating with, 
and potentially attributable to, the escalating air pollution from this heavy industry. This 
is demonstrated by acute respiratory and circulatory hospitalisation. Hospitalisation is an 
extreme indicator of morbidly and does not take into account the potential full spectrum 
of health harms experienced by the community.
Conclusion
Health impacts from Coal Seam Gas have been a major community concern since the 
introduction of CSG industries in Queensland. For almost a decade the community has 
recognised and reported concerns about their changed health status.
Whilst the full range of factors underlying the escalating hospitalisation of Darling 
Downs’ residents for acute respiratory and circulatory conditions is unknown, the DDHHS 
statistics are significant and warrant full investigation as to causal factors. Communities in 
the Darling Downs have been exposed to significant pollution associated with the rapid and 
extreme industrialisation by the gas industry and with toxins directly attributable to that 
industry. The considerable growth in hospitalisations for acute respiratory and circulatory 
conditions concurrent with the increase in toxic pollutants in the local airspace suggests 
that controls to limit exposure are ineffectual.
A growing body of published research on the industry’s emissions and resultant adverse 
health impacts supports the decisions by other jurisdictions (France, Ireland, Bulgaria, New 
York State), to impose bans on unconventional gas development. Acute hospitalisation data 
from the Darling Downs raise a red flag. It is urgent that there should be a comprehensive 
investigation of the health impacts from the unconventional gas industry in Australia.
