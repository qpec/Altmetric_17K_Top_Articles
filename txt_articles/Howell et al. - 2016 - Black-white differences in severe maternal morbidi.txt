Abstract
BACKGROUND—For every maternal death, over 100 women experience severe maternal 
morbidity, a life threatening diagnosis or undergo a life-saving procedure, during their delivery 
hospitalization. Similar to racial/ethnic disparities in maternal mortality, black women are more 
likely to suffer from severe maternal morbidity than white women. Site of care has received 
attention as a mechanism explaining disparities in other areas of medicine. Data indicate that 
blacks receive care in a concentrated set of hospitals and these hospitals appear to provide lower 
quality of care. Whether racial differences in site of delivery contribute to observed black-white 
disparities in severe maternal morbidity rates is unknown.
OBJECTIVE—To determine whether hospitals with high proportions of black deliveries have 
higher severe maternal morbidity and if such differences contribute to overall black-white 
disparities in severe maternal morbidity.
STUDY DESIGN—We used a published algorithm to identify cases of severe maternal morbidity 
during deliveries in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 2010 and 2011. We ranked hospitals by 
their proportion of black deliveries into high black-serving (top 5%), medium black-serving (5% 
to 25% range) and low black-serving hospitals. We analyzed the risks of severe maternal 
morbidity for black and white women by hospital black-serving status using logistic regressions 
adjusted for patient characteristics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, and within-hospital 
clustering. We then derived adjusted rates from these models.

 RESULTS—Seventy-four percent of black deliveries occurred at high and medium black-serving 
hospitals. Overall, severe maternal morbidity occurred more frequently among black than white 
women (25.8 vs. 11.8 per 1000 deliveries, p<.001); after adjusting for the distribution of patient 
characteristics and comorbidities, this differential declined, but remained elevated (18.8 vs. 
13.3per 1000 deliveries respectively, p<.001). Women delivering in high and medium black-
serving hospitals had elevated rates of severe maternal morbidity rates compared with those in low 
black-serving hospitals in unadjusted (29.4, 19.4, versus 12.2 per 1000 deliveries respectively, 
p<0 .001) and adjusted analyses (17.3, 16.5 vs. 13.5 per 1000 deliveries respectively, p<.001). 
Black women who delivered at high black-serving hospitals had the highest risk of poor outcomes.
CONCLUSION—Most black deliveries occur in a concentrated set of hospitals, and these 
hospitals have higher severe maternal morbidity rates. Targeting quality improvement efforts at 
these hospitals may improve care for all deliveries and disproportionately impact care for black 
women.
Keywords
severe maternal morbidity; quality of care; obstetrics; disparities
Deaths associated with pregnancy in the United States are the “tip of the iceberg”;1 for every 
maternal death, over a 100 women experience severe maternal morbidity, a life threatening 
diagnosis or undergo a life-saving procedure during delivery hospitalization.1,2 Severe 
maternal morbidity affects ~60,000 women annually in the US.2,3 Similar to racial/ethnic 
disparities in maternal mortality, black women are more likely to suffer from severe 
maternal morbidity than white women.1 Data suggest that a significant proportion of 
maternal mortality and morbidity may be preventable,4-6 making quality of health care 
delivered in hospitals an essential lever for improving outcomes and narrowing disparities.
Site of care has received increasing attention as a mechanism explaining disparities. Prior 
studies have documented that blacks receive care in a concentrated set of hospitals and these 
hospitals appear to provide lower quality of care.7,8 For example, investigators have found 
that hospitals with higher proportion of black patients have higher mortality for surgery, 
heart attacks, and very low birth weight neonates.9-11 In obstetrics, investigators 
documented that black-serving hospitals performed worse than other hospitals on 12 of 15 
delivery-related indicators.12 Whether racial differences in site of delivery contribute to 
observed black-white disparities in severe maternal morbidity rates is unknown. The 
objectives of this study were to examine whether hospitals with high proportions of black 
deliveries have higher severe maternal morbidity rates and if such differences contribute to 
overall black-white disparities in severe maternal morbidity rates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used data from the 2010 and 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost 
and Utilization Project, a federal–state–industry partnership sponsored by the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample is a stratified sample 
representing 20% of U.S. community hospitals. Each record is weighted to account for the 
complex sampling and when weights are applied during analysis, nationwide estimates can

Accessed 10/8/2014.) The Nationwide Inpatient Sample data does not include personal 
identifiers. The Mount Sinai Program for Protection of Human Subjects (Institutional 
Review Board) deemed this research exempt.
STUDY SAMPLE
Delivery hospitalizations were identified based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure 
codes and DRG delivery codes.13 We examined all deliveries that occurred in hospitals with 
at least 10 deliveries annually, because we wanted to analyze hospitals with an obstetric 
volume high enough to preclude hospitals with no routine obstetrical practice and therefore 
excluded 408 (77 unweighted) deliveries at 171 hospitals (35 unweighted). We limited our 
analyses to black and white deliveries and excluded 2,472,365 additional deliveries on this 
basis. Some hospitals do not routinely record data on race/ethnicity in their hospital 
discharge summaries and thus race was missing for 722 hospitals (152 unweighted) 
approximately 11.2% of the hospitals. This resulted in the exclusion of .005% white 
deliveries and .007% black deliveries. Severe maternal morbidity was not different for 
deliveries in the hospitals with and without data on race (1.51 vs. 1.34, p=0.37). Our analysis 
thus included 5,539 (1,146 unweighted, 1140 unique hospitals for combined 2010-2011 
dataset) hospitals that provided delivery services and 4,609,291 (942,622 unweighted) 
deliveries. Only national estimates are presented in the results section.
SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY
We used a published algorithm defined by investigators from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention to identify severe maternal morbidity (primary outcome), which is a 
potentially life-threatening diagnosis or receipt of a life-saving procedure (e.g. renal failure, 
shock, embolism, eclampsia, septicemia, mechanical ventilation, transfusion).2 The 
algorithm includes 25 categories that capture indicators of organ-system dysfunction. It 
hierarchically classifies all severe maternal morbidity hospitalizations associated with in-
hospital mortality or transfer as hospitalizations with severe complications regardless of the 
length of stay. In-hospital mortality was identified using the variable “died during 
hospitalization” and transfer status using “disposition of patient” or “admission source” in 
NIS. Length of stay is also a part of this algorithm. Hospitalizations with severe morbidity 
and a short length of stay were not classified as cases of severe maternal morbidity as 
specified by the CDC algorithm. Short length of hospital stay was defined as length of stay 
less than the 90th percentile as calculated separately for vaginal, primary, and repeat 
cesarean deliveries. Length of stay restrictions were not applied to delivery hospitalizations 
with severe complications identified by procedure codes (e.g., hysterectomy, blood 
transfusion, ventilation) as recommended.2
BLACK-SERVING DELIVERY HOSPITALS
Similar to methods used by Jha et al,8,14 we ranked hospitals by their proportion of black 
deliveries among all deliveries and chose two cut off points. We defined the top 5% of 
hospitals as high black-serving hospitals, the next 20% (those in the >5% to <=25% range) 
as medium black-serving hospitals, and the remaining 75% of hospitals as low black-serving

 hospitals. 279 hospitals (5%) were designated as high black-serving, 1106 hospitals (20 
percent) were designated as medium black-serving, and 4102 (75%) as low black serving.
CO-VARIABLES
Risk adjustment variables were chosen by their association with the outcome, biological 
plausibility, and prior research.15,16 Our aim was to adjust for factors likely to affect 
maternal morbidity and hospital of delivery. We included maternal sociodemographic 
characteristics (age, race, zip code income), clinical factors (e.g. multiple births, previous 
cesarean delivery) and comorbid conditions and antepartum complications (e.g. diabetes, 
hypertension, preeclampsia, obesity, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, 
disorders of placentation).17 Hospital characteristics included teaching status, hospital 
ownership, delivery volume, rural or urban location, hospital region (Northeast, Midwest, 
South, West), bedsize, and percent of Medicaid admissions as a proxy for the proportion of 
poor patients the hospitals serves.
ANALYSIS
We compared the characteristics of black versus white women with severe maternal 
morbidity using Rao-Scot chi square tests for categorical data. We used analysis of variance 
and chi square tests as appropriate to examine the characteristics of delivery hospitals 
according to the proportion of their black deliveries. For our primary outcome, risk-adjusted 
probability of severe maternal morbidity, we estimated four multivariable patient-level 
logistic regression models. Each model incorporated the survey weights; the variance 
estimates accounted for the NIS sampling structure.18
The first model included race and patient risk factors only; the second included these 
variables plus indicator variables for whether the hospital was a high-, medium-, or low-
black serving hospital. The third included these variables plus the other hospital levels 
variables listed above. For the fourth model, we included patient risk factors, race, and 
black-serving status of the hospital, and variables representing the interaction between race 
and black-serving status of the hospital. Using this model, we estimated the risk-adjusted 
predicted probability of severe maternal morbidity for six categories of race and hospital: 
black and white patients, respectively, at high black-serving hospitals; black and white 
patients, respectively, at medium black-serving hospitals; and black and white patients, 
respectively, at low black-serving hospitals. We used recycled predictions to calculate 
predicted probabilities using the margins command; confidence intervals were estimated 
using the delta method.19
We conducted two sensitivity analyses. First, we estimated the multivariable patient-level 
logistic regression model and added cesarean as a covariate. Second, we conducted the 
analyses after excluding hospitals with <30 deliveries. All statistical analyses were 
performed using the SAS system software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and 
Stata/SE 13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). All tests were two-tailed and a p-value 
of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

 RESULTS
In 2010 and 2011 there were 3,584,639 (78%) deliveries to white women and 1,024,652 
(22%) to black women. Black women were more likely to be younger, have Medicaid 
insurance, live in lower-income zip code neighborhoods, and have more comorbid 
conditions than white women (Table 1). Of the 4.6 million total deliveries, 68,841 were 
associated with severe maternal morbidity (15.0 cases per 1000).
High black-serving hospitals provided delivery services for approximately 24.0% of all 
black deliveries and medium black-serving hospitals cared for an additional 49.7 percent of 
black pregnant women. Thus, high and medium black-serving hospitals provided delivery 
services for 73.7 percent of all black deliveries. In comparison, high black-serving hospitals 
provided delivery services for 1.8% of all white deliveries and medium black-serving 
hospitals provided delivery services for 16.0% of all white deliveries.
Both high and medium black-serving hospitals had different characteristics from low black-
serving hospitals (Table 2). Black-serving hospitals were more likely to be: located in an 
urban area, located in the South, be a teaching hospital, have a higher delivery volume, have 
larger bed size, and have a higher proportion of Medicaid deliveries.
Table 3 presents crude and adjusted rates of severe maternal morbidity by race and site of 
care. Unadjusted rates were higher among blacks than whites (25.8 vs. 11.8 per 1000 
deliveries respectively, p<.0001). Excess comorbidities among black women explained a 
significant portion of this disparity. After adjustment for patient characteristics and 
comorbidities, the rates were 18.8 and 13.3 respectively (p<.0001). These rates are those that 
would be expected if patient characteristics and comorbidities in the population were 
similarly distributed among whites and blacks, which leads to an increase for whites and a 
decrease for blacks. Women delivering in high and medium black-serving hospitals had 
higher severe maternal morbidity rates than those in low black-serving hospitals (29.4, 19.4, 
versus 12.2 per 1000 deliveries respectively, p<0 .001). Adjustment for sociodemographic, 
clinical, and hospital factors attenuated these differences (17.3, 16.5 vs. 13.5 per 1000 
deliveries respectively, p<.001).
Figure 1 presents adjusted rates of severe maternal morbidity for black and white women by 
black-serving hospital status. Of the six groups, white patients at low black-serving hospitals 
had the lowest rates of adjusted severe maternal morbidity (12.3 per 1000 deliveries) and 
black patients at high black-serving hospitals had the highest (20.5 per 1000 deliveries). 
White patients at high black-serving hospitals also had elevated adjusted rates of severe 
maternal morbidity (19.2 per 1000 deliveries). As compared with white women who 
delivered at low black-serving hospitals, black and white women who delivered at high 
black-serving hospitals had 66.9% (p=.002) and 56.9% (p=.006) respectively higher 
adjusted rates of severe maternal morbidity. Results were essentially unchanged for the 
analysis which included cesarean as a covariate in the multivariable model. Likewise the 
results were unchanged when we used a different obstetrical volume (<30 deliveries 
annually) to exclude hospitals from the analysis.

 COMMENT
We found that severe maternal morbidity occurred more than twice as often in black 
deliveries than white deliveries. While some of these differences were due to higher rates of 
comorbidity among black than white women, our data demonstrate that some of these 
disparities may be caused by differences in the health care settings where white and black 
women receive obstetrical delivery care. We examined the concentration of delivery care for 
black women and found that a quarter of hospitals provided care for three quarters of all 
black deliveries in the Unites States. Hospitals that disproportionately cared for black 
deliveries had higher severe maternal morbidity rates after adjustment for patient and 
hospital characteristics.
Understanding why racial disparities in maternal outcomes exist is the first step in 
eliminating them. The vast majority of research on racial/ethnic disparities in obstetrics has 
attributed differences in outcomes to social and biological/genetic factors,20 and has not 
accounted for the systems within which obstetric care is delivered and how differences in 
quality of care may contribute to disparities.8 We found that both black and white patients 
who delivered in black-serving hospitals had a higher risk of severe maternal morbidity after 
accounting for patient characteristics. Adjusting for differences in hospital characteristics 
had little effect on our primary findings and may suggest that quality of care at hospitals that 
disproportionately serve blacks is lower than quality at low black-serving hospitals.
Our results are similar to findings in other reports.9-11,21,22 In obstetrics, investigators found 
that black-serving hospitals performed worse than other hospitals on the majority of 
delivery-related indicators using data from seven states.12 Our study builds on this previous 
work by giving national estimates and examining severe maternal morbidity as the outcome 
of interest. Further, we used methods to categorize black-serving hospitals employed in 
healthcare quality assessment,8,14 and were thus able to examine both the concentration of 
care by race, and the extent to which racial differences in site of care contribute to racial 
differences in severe maternal morbidity. In other areas of medicine, multiple studies have 
demonstrated that blacks receive care in a concentrated set of hospitals and that these 
hospitals appear to provide lower quality of care. Disparities in outcomes including acute 
MI, surgical mortality, VLBW mortality, and readmission for CHF and acute MI have been 
found to be due in part to where minorities and whites receive care.9-11,21,22 Similarly, 
disparities in receipt of appropriate care such as thrombotic therapy, angioplasty, carotid 
imaging, and provision of timely antibiotics for pneumonia are lower in hospitals that serve 
a high proportion of blacks.7,8,23 Our findings add to this body of literature and suggest that 
targeting interventions to improve care at hospitals that serve a high proportion of blacks 
may reduce poor outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities.
After adjusting for patient- and hospital-level factors, black women had higher adjusted rate 
of severe maternal morbidity than white women. Our results confirm the high risk of adverse 
outcomes faced by black women giving birth in comparison with white women in the US 
and are similar to findings by others.16,24 Comorbidities and pregnancy complications have 
been demonstrated to be highly associated with severe maternal morbidity,17 and explained

 a significant portion of the elevated risk for severe maternal morbidity among blacks in this 
cohort.
Both black and white women who delivered at high black-serving hospitals had higher 
adjusted rates of severe maternal morbidity. Chronic illnesses and pregnancy complications 
require close antepartum management and it is possible that the availability of high quality 
antenatal care is limited for patients who deliver at black-serving hospitals. Targeted 
preventive community based programs (both preconceptually and antenatally) in the 
catchment areas serving these hospitals may be an important step to reducing 
disparities.25,26
Our study had limitations. We used administrative data (ICD-9 procedure and diagnosis 
codes) that do not contain important clinical data on severity of illness, and may have 
constrained our ability to adequately risk-adjust. For example, we were unable to control for 
adequacy of prenatal care, parity, medication exposure, number of previous cesareans, and 
other clinical factors that may be associated with severe maternal morbidity. In addition our 
use of administrative data limited our ability to adequately adjust for obesity. We limited our 
study to care for black and white deliveries because administrative data sources are often 
less reliable for other race/ethnicity groups.27 Nevertheless, we constructed a robust model 
that adjusted for variation in comorbidities and obstetrical complications across these racial 
groups and hospitals.
Three quarters of black deliveries in the United States occur in a quarter of the hospitals, and 
our data suggests that these hospitals may provide lower quality of care. Our findings 
highlight the need for targeting quality improvement efforts that address both antenatal and 
delivery care factors for pregnant women who deliver at these hospitals. This strategy has 
the potential to improve care for all women who deliver in these hospitals and can have a 
disproportionate impact on the care of black pregnant women.
