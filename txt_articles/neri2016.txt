BACKGROUND: Comparative effectiveness studies of state tobacco quitlines and Web-based tobacco cessation interventions are lim-
ited. In 2009, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention undertook a study of the comparative effectiveness of state quit-
lines and Web-based tobacco cessation interventions. METHODS: Standardized questionnaires were administered to smokers who
enrolled exclusively in either quitlines or Web-based tobacco cessation services in 4 states in 2011-2012. The primary outcome was
the 30-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) rate at 7 months both between and within interventions. RESULTS: A total of 4086
participants were included in the analysis. Quitline users were significantly older, more heterogeneous in terms of race and ethnicity,
less educated, less likely to be employed, and more often single than Web-based users. The 7-month 30-day PPA rate was 32% for
quitline users and 27% for Web-based users. Multivariate models comparing 30-day PPA rates between interventions indicated that
significantly increased odds of quitting were associated with being partnered, not living with another smoker, low baseline cigarette
use, and more interactions with the intervention. After adjustments for demographic and tobacco use characteristics, quitline
users had 1.26 the odds of being abstinent in comparison with Web-based users (95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.58; P 5 .053).
CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the largest comparative effectiveness studies of state tobacco cessation interventions to date. These
findings will help public health agencies develop and tailor evidence-based tobacco cessation programs. Further research should
focus on users of Web-based cessation interventions sponsored by state health departments and their cost-effectiveness. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Tobacco cessation is an essential component of tobacco control for preventing the morbidity and mortality caused by
tobacco use.1-3 Tobacco causes 12 different types of cancer, including lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer
death in the United States.3,4 Cigarette smoking accounts for 83% of all US tobacco use (excluding cigar and pipe tobacco
use).5 Population-level tobacco cessation programs have traditionally relied on quitlines (telephone-based counseling),
and the odds of tobacco abstinence are increased by approximately 60% with quitline usage.6 Although all 50 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam currently provide quitline services, only 1% to 2% of adult tobacco users in
the United States access quitlines each year.7,8 The low reach of quitlines has been attributed to insufficient funding
coupled with a lack of interest or belief in the efficacy of quitlines by users.1,9
The Internet plays an expanding role in helping people to stop smoking. In 2012, an estimated 255 million people
(82% of the US population) had access to the Internet, and 65% of adult Internet users had used a social media Web
site.10 In 2004, an estimated 7% of Web users (approximately 8 million US adults) reported having visited a smoking

 cessation Web site.11 As of July 2013, 51 of 53 US state or
territorial tobacco control programs (96%) sponsored
smoking cessation Web sites, 38 of these 51 Web sites
(75%) offered self-help tools, and 31 of these 51 sites
(61%) offered interactive counseling online.12 Increased
access to both the Internet and Web-based cessation serv-
ices has contributed to a 2.6-fold increase in registrants
for Web-based interventions that were integrated with
quitlines between 2009 and 2012.12 Yet, sustained use of
Web-based interventions is low, with most users visiting
some cessation Web sites fewer than 3 times.13
Several randomized trials of individually tailored
Web-based smoking cessation programs have reported re-
sponder quit rates of 17% to 32% at 6 months’ follow-up;
these rates approximate those reported by quitlines.13-16
Some studies have reported a dose-response relationship
between Web site utilization (eg, the number of logins
and features used) and successful quitting.13,17-19 Con-
versely, other studies have not found significant differen-
ces in cessation rates in Web-based programs in
comparison with or as an adjunct to quitline interven-
tions.20,21 As a result of these inconsistencies, both
Cochrane and Community Guide to Preventive Services
reviews indicate that it is inconclusive whether Web-based
tobacco programs are effective in tobacco cessation.2,22
Few studies have compared quitline interventions
with Web-based interventions, and fewer yet have looked
at populations served by state tobacco cessation services.
Zbikowski et al23 studied 11,143 proactively recruited
health plan members 6 months after they had enrolled in
a cessation program. They found that each additional tele-
phone call increased the odds of quitting by 56% versus
14% for each login. Swan et al24 recruited 1202 health
plan members and found no significant differences
between 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) out-
comes for Web interventions, quitlines, and quitlines
combined with Web interventions at 6 months’ follow-
up. Graham et al25 compared the cessation success of
2005 US smokers recruited via the Internet. Participants
were enrolled in a non-tailored Web intervention,
enhanced (individually tailored) Web intervention, or
enhanced Web intervention combined with a quitline.
There were no significant differences in 30-day PPA rates
between these interventions when they were measured at
18 months’ follow-up. Yet, the 30-day PPA rate was sig-
nificantly greater with the combined enhanced Web/tele-
phone option versus the enhanced Web–alone option
when they accounted for the repeated measurement of 30-
day PPA for an individual subject throughout the study.
Finally, An et al26 reported a comparison of quitlines and
Web-based interventions in uninsured cessation program
users in Minnesota. These researchers recruited 1706
uninsured users of state quitline and Web-based cessation
services. Users enrolling via a quitline had 2.23 the odds
of being abstinent for 30 days in comparison with Web-
based enrollees (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-3.67)
when they were measured at 6 months’ follow-up in a
multivariate model.
Unfortunately, a majority of tobacco cessation com-
parative effectiveness studies published to date have
focused on individuals with private insurance, and this
indicates a gap in the understanding about populations
using state cessation services.23,24 Although more effective
tobacco cessation interventions managed by states, tribes,
and territories can improve efforts to address the dispro-
portionate prevalence of smoking and smoking-related
disease in these populations, little information exists to
help inform their decisions. Existing comparative effec-
tiveness studies largely focus on health plan–based cessa-
tion activities or are limited to a single state. With limited
funding for tobacco control and expanding public access
to the Internet, it is essential that public health practi-
tioners understand the comparative effectiveness of pub-
licly managed quitline and Web-based tobacco cessation
interventions. In 2011, the US Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) received funding from the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to compare the
effectiveness of traditional and innovative cessation serv-
ices in multiple states.27 This is one of the largest compar-
ative effectiveness studies in state-based user populations
to date. This study sought to describe differences between
users in the 2 interventions with respect to demographics,
smoking and quitting behaviors, smoking abstinence
rates, and predictors of successful quitting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All study materials were reviewed and approved by the
appropriate institutional review boards. The target
recruitment population was tobacco users who, of their
own initiative and with only the normally available incen-
tives, visited or called a state tobacco cessation Web site or
quitline. All CDC-funded tobacco control programs that
followed the North American Quitline Consortium
(NAQC) Minimum Data Set recommendations and had
sufficient staff resources to support study participation
were invited to apply to participate in the study. Four pro-
grams were selected from interested applicants: Alabama,
Arizona, Florida, and Vermont.
Each program offered a variety of services at the time
of the study. Alabama offered counseling quitline services

 in multiple languages during the day from Monday
through Saturday. Web-based users in Alabama had access
to interactive counseling as well. Users of either interven-
tion in Alabama received 2 weeks of free nicotine replace-
ment therapy (NRT). In Arizona, counselors who spoke
English or Spanish were available to both quitline users
and Web-based users during the day from Monday
through Thursday and on Saturday. Users of either inter-
vention also could get 2 weeks of free NRT. In Florida,
users of either the quitline or Web-based interventions
could have up to 5 sessions with counselors who spoke
English or Spanish 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Users of
either intervention in Florida could receive up to 4 weeks
of free NRT. In Vermont, users of either intervention had
access to up to 5 sessions with counselors as well as up to 8
weeks of NRT. Web-based users in Vermont also had
access to social networks of former smokers.
The study sought to recruit 4000 participants for each
type of intervention (8000 total); it assumed an a value of
.05, a power of 0.80, equal sample sizes, and a 50% response
rate to be able to determine a 3% difference between quitline
and Web-based PPAs.28 Participants enrolling in either
intervention were offered information when they enrolled
about the potential to participate in the study. All users in
Alabama, Arizona, and Vermont as well as every fourth per-
son to register in each intervention in Florida (because of the
large number of potential participants from Florida) were
offered information about participating. Participants who
indicated an interest in participating upon registration were
contacted 7 months after registration to consent to release
self-reported information collected at intake and to partici-
pate in a follow-up survey.
The self-report questionnaires that were used for
intake and follow-up data used NAQC Minimum Data
Set–recommended questions. The intake survey (adminis-
tered through the mode of the intervention) consisted of
37 questions, including basic demographic information
(eg, date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity, and education), the
reason for enrolling in quitline or Web-based services, the
referral source, and smoking-related questions (current
tobacco use by type, frequency/intensity of use, prior quit
attempts, and intention to quit). The follow-up survey
consisted of 44 questions related to demographic informa-
tion (marital status, race, ethnicity, and education),
smoking-related factors in their environment, use of tech-
nology, access to a landline/cellular telephone or ever use
of the Internet, satisfaction with cessation services, quit-
ting behaviors, intention to quit, self-reported abstinence
from smoking, and current tobacco use. The frequency of
interaction with the service, as noted by logins or calls,
was obtained from the tobacco cessation programs. In
some cases, the same demographic information was col-
lected at both intake and follow-up.
Follow-up data were collected between February
and September 2012. In an effort to balance the number
of participants by state, the study attempted to follow up
all consenting users in Vermont and Alabama and a ran-
dom selection of users in Florida. Lower than anticipated
participation rates for users in Vermont and Alabama in
combination with large volumes of users in Arizona and
Florida resulted in the need to adjust sampling schemes
for Arizona from a cohort-based method to a random
selection method for quitline users and vice versa for
Web-based users during the recruitment period. This
resulted in the overall analytic sample having proportion-
ately more respondents from Arizona and Florida versus
Alabama and Vermont. Recruitment for follow-up was
based on a sequential approach that attempted contact
first through e-mail and subsequently through postal
mail. If there was no response within 2 weeks, attempts
were made via computer-assisted telephone interviews.
This is an approach similar to that reported by and Groves
et al29 and Biemer and Lyberg.30 Participants were offered
$40 at the follow-up call to compensate them for their
time. From June 19, 2012 onward (approximately half-
way through data collection), an express mail service,
instead of postal mail, was used to enhance recruitment of
the Web-based intervention users; this was a procedure
reported by Dillman.31
The primary outcome for the analysis was 30-day
PPA at 7 months’ follow-up as recommended by the
NAQC.12 Analyses were conducted with SAS 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) and the rms package (version
4.1-0) in R 3.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing, Vienna, Austria). Any users reporting use of both
quitlines and Web services during the intervention period,
those who did not make a quit attempt, and those report-
ing no interactions with the intervention were excluded
from the primary analyses. Continuous variables were
reported as means or medians with ranges and/or 25th
and 75th percentiles. Discrete variables were reported as
percentages. The comparison of categorical variables
involved the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel general associa-
tion test. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov 2-sample test for
nonparametric analyses was used for bivariate analyses of
continuous variables because no continuous variables
were normally distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk
test. Differences in data collection did not allow meaning-
ful comparisons between responders and nonresponders.
Response rates for those receiving or not receiving the

 express mailers were compared. Only participants with
responses for the outcomes of interest (eg, self-reported
abstinence at 30 days measured 7 months after enroll-
ment) were considered for analysis in accordance with the
NAQC recommendation to use a responder rate model-
ing approach.32
Multivariate logistic regression models comparing
abstinent users and non-abstinent users within and
between interventions were developed with demographics
(state, age, sex, race, ethnicity, and marital status), socioe-
conomic characteristics (education and employment sta-
tus), smoking characteristics (living with a smoker at
baseline and baseline number of cigarettes smoked per
day), and smoking cessation–related service use (intention
to quit at enrollment, total number of interactions with
the service, use of NRT, use of services beyond the state-
based interventions, and use of counseling during inter-
vention) as independent variables. The linearity assump-
tion for continuous variables was assessed with restricted
cubic spline functions.33-35 The relation between age and
smoking cessation was found to be linear, and age was
treated as a linear effect in the final models. Baseline ciga-
rettes per day and the total number of interactions with
the intervention were non-linear and were transformed
with 3-knot tail restricted cubic spline functions. The cut-
off for significance in all analyses was P < .05.
RESULTS
A total of 16,332 participants were eligible for follow-up,
and the study recruited 7901 participants for an overall
response rate of 48% at follow-up. The average length of
follow-up was 7.3 months from the time of intake.
Among the 3102 participants who received the express
mailer, 1166 (38%) completed the follow-up, whereas
226 of the 1485 (15%) who did not receive the express
mailer completed the follow-up (P < .001). A total of
4086 participants were available for analysis after the
exclusion of those self-reporting the use of both quitline
and Web-based services or missing this information on
the follow-up survey (n 5 2616), those reporting no
interactions with the service or missing this information
(n 5 1175), and those who did not make a quit attempt
(n 5 24). A chart outlining the study population sizes
from recruitment and exclusion and for the final analyses
is available online as supporting information.
Table 1 presents the demographics and tobacco use
characteristics of each intervention population. Approxi-
mately 60% of the users of either intervention were female.
Quitline users were significantly older (mean age for quit-
line users, 47.0 years; mean age for Web-based users, 39.8
years). The predominant user population for both inter-
ventions was non-Hispanic white, but this proportion was
significantly lower among quitline users (74%) versus
Web-based users (86%). However, proportionately more
quitline users self-identified as non-Hispanic black (12%
of quitline users vs 4% of Web-based users), American In-
dian/Alaska Native (2% of quitline users vs <1% of Web-
based users), or multiracial (4% of quitline users vs 2% of
Web-based users). More quitline users were single in com-
parison with Web-based users (60% vs 47%, P < .001),
but significantly lower proportions of quitline users were
employed in comparison with Web-based users (37% vs
61%). Significantly fewer quitline users had education
beyond high school in comparison with Web-based users.
The proportion of participants for each modality from
each state varied significantly (P < .001), with 45% of
quitline users coming from Arizona and 77% of Web-
based users coming from Florida.
Significant differences between quitline and Web-
based users were found for the following tobacco use and
cessation characteristics: cigarettes smoked per day at
intake (mean, 19.0 for quitline users vs 18.3 for Web-
based users), smoking within 5 minutes of waking (47%
for quitline users vs 38% for Web-based users), another
smoker in the household (37% for quitline users vs 44%
for Web-based users), and intention to quit (97% for
quitline users vs 89% for Web-based users). The median
number of interactions was 2 for each intervention, but
there were statistically significant differences in the fre-
quency distribution across interventions. At 7 months’
follow-up, the 30-day PPA rate was 32% for quitline users
and 27% for Web-based users.
Comparing the 2 interventions, Table 2 reports the
multivariate model results with successful cessation at 30
days as measured at 7 months’ follow-up as the outcome;
adjustments were made for multiple variables. The signifi-
cant factors associated with 30-day PPA at 7 months were
as follows: being partnered versus being single (odds ratio
[OR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.20-1.64), not having another
smoker in the house (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 2.00-2.77),
baseline cigarettes per day, and total interactions with the
intervention (both nonlinear relationships with P values
� .001). Controlling for all other variables, we found that
quitline users had 1.26 the odds of reporting tobacco ab-
stinence over the prior 30 days at 7 months’ follow-up in
comparison with Web-based users (OR, 1.26; 95% CI,
1.00-1.58), and this did not meet the criteria for statistical
significance (P 5 .053).
In the multivariate model, higher baseline cigarette
usage was associated with a lower 30-day PPA rate up to
Quitline vs Web-Based Tobacco Cessation/Neri et al
Cancer

 approximately 20 cigarettes per day (Fig. 1). Above this
point, higher cigarette usage per day was associated with a
higher 30-day PPA rate. Total interactions with an inter-
vention up to approximately 12 interactions were associ-
ated with a higher 30-day PPA rate. Total interactions
beyond approximately 12 interactions were not associated
with a higher 30-day PPA rate.
Additional multivariate analyses comparing factors
within each intervention resulted in largely the same varia-
bles as those in the between-intervention comparison
being significant (see online supporting information).
DISCUSSION
The bivariate and multivariate results of this comparative
effectiveness study provide valuable insights for state
tobacco cessation and cancer control programs. This study
found that users of state-sponsored tobacco cessation quit-
lines or Web sites were different with respect to demo-
graphic and smoking characteristics. Quitline users were
older, had a different racial distribution (although both
were mainly non-Hispanic white), were less likely to be
employed, were less educated, were more likely to be sin-
gle, were less likely to have access to the other modality,

findings largely reinforce similar differences in the same
direction noted by An et al26 yet on a larger scale.

Observations with information missing for at least 1 variable were excluded
from the multivariate model, and this resulted in lower numbers of observa-
tions than reported for bivariate analyses.
a The multivariate models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education,

of nicotine replacement therapy during the quit attempt, use of medication
to stop smoking, use of services beyond the state-based interventions,

approximately 12 interactions were associated with a higher
30-day PPA rate. Total interactions beyond approximately 12
interactions were not associated with a higher 30-day PPA
rate. Abbreviation: PPA, point prevalence abstinence.

 in comparison with those using the Web-based interven-
tion, although this did not meet the criteria for statistical
significance. Because there is a strong evidence base to
support the effectiveness of quitlines, one interpretation
of these findings is that, although the demographic pro-
files of users of quitlines and Web-based interventions are
different, these 4 state Web-based tobacco cessation pro-
grams were nearly as effective in promoting tobacco cessa-
tion as quitlines among comparable populations. This
novel finding, in comparison with previous smaller stud-
ies, indicates the need for further evaluation of specific
Web-based interventions sponsored by state health
departments that may help to improve tobacco cessation
services offered via the Internet.
Although 30-day PPA has been associated with base-
line cigarette consumption in previous studies, the U-
shaped curve associated with 30-day PPA and baseline cig-
arette consumption found here appears to be novel, but
the interpretation is unclear, and more research needs to
be conducted for this finding. Finally, there was an
increasing 30-day PPA rate with increasing interactions
with the interventions that was attenuated after approxi-
mately 12 interactions. The attenuation observed in this
study is consistent with other studies.6 A number of stud-
ies have indicated that the baseline smoking frequency
and intervention use are key factors related to quit suc-
cess.36 A complementary analysis of this data set that com-
pared users of both interventions with those who just used
quitlines or Web-based interventions reinforces these
findings and indicates that the use of both interventions
enhances the odds of quit success.37
Overall, the characteristics of the study participants
in both interventions mirrored those of 2013 NAQC
quitline user populations in terms of age distribution, sex
(mean for female sex, 58% for NAQC vs 60% for this
study), education (mean for education � high school,
81% for NAQC vs 87% for this study), ethnicity (mean
for Hispanic, 10% for NAQC vs 7% for this study), and
race distribution (approximately equal) as reported in the
CDC State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation
system.38 These similarities indicate that some of the
results of this study may be of use to other state-based
tobacco cessation and cancer control programs.39
This study was 1 of 3 undertaken by the CDC that
compared the effectiveness of tobacco cessation at the
individual, community, and state levels. All 3 studies have
indicated that collaborative efforts between tobacco and
other disease-specific programs are key to focusing
tobacco control efforts and efficiently using resources
within states, tribes, territories, and local communities.
The CDC and its partners continue to work across dis-
ease- and risk factor–specific areas to improve tobacco
control nationwide. One example is a collaborative by the
CDC’s National Comprehensive Cancer Control Pro-
gram and Tobacco Control Program to jointly fund sev-
eral national networks to provide technical assistance to
their grantees to reduce tobacco- and cancer-related dis-
parities among their populations.40 This support and sim-
ilar efforts throughout the CDC help to make efficient
use of existing resources and supply continuity of knowl-
edge about attitudes and practices for tobacco cessation to
prevent cancer and other chronic diseases.
The limitations of this study include focusing on
self-selected, state-based tobacco users of just 1 cessation
intervention type. Most notably, the quitline population
was predominantly from Arizona (45%), whereas the
Web-based population was predominantly from Florida
(77%). Although multivariate modeling likely adjusted
for many inherent differences between user populations in
these states versus others in each intervention, it is possible
that the results may not be representative of all popula-
tions. Although this article is focused exclusively on
single-intervention users, it is clear that many cessation
program participants use multiple services to stop smok-
ing, and a separate analysis of information from dual users
collected in this study reinforces these previous find-
ings.11,37,41 Unfortunately, differences in data collection
did not allow a proper comparison of responders and non-
responders, and this limits our ability to interpret any
biases that may be associated with responding to the
follow-up survey.
In conclusion, the results presented here will allow
cancer, chronic disease, and tobacco control programs to
better tailor their interventions to users with specific dem-
ographics and tobacco use characteristics to more effec-
tively reach and help tobacco users quit. Web-based
tobacco cessation services are increasingly prevalent and
more frequently used than before. This is one of the first
studies to find no significant difference in 30-day PPA at
7 months’ follow-up for Web-based users versus quitline
users in multivariate models. Yet, the study did not collect
enough information about the specific intervention
approaches in each state for Web-based users to fully eval-
uate this finding. These results indicate the need for more
in-depth analyses related to what components of Web-
based interventions work in specific populations as well as
a better understanding of factors associated with quit suc-
cess in these populations to expand the evidence base for
effective tobacco cessation interventions.
