BACKGROUND: Night shift work, exposure to light at night (ALAN) and circadian disruption may increase the risk of hormone-dependent cancers.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the association of exposure to ALAN during sleeping time with breast and prostate cancer in a population based
multicase–control study (MCC-Spain), among subjects who had never worked at night. We evaluated chronotype, a characteristic that may relate to
adaptation to light at night.
METHODS: We enrolled 1,219 breast cancer cases, 1,385 female controls, 623 prostate cancer cases, and 879 male controls from 11 Spanish regions
in 2008–2013. Indoor ALAN information was obtained through questionnaires. Outdoor ALAN was analyzed using images from the International
Space Station (ISS) available for Barcelona and Madrid for 2012–2013, including data of remotely sensed upward light intensity and blue light spec-
trum information for each geocoded longest residence of each MCC-Spain subject.
RESULTS: Among Barcelona and Madrid participants with information on both indoor and outdoor ALAN, exposure to outdoor ALAN in the blue
light spectrum was associated with breast cancer [adjusted odds ratio (OR) for highest vs. lowest tertile, OR = 1:47; 95% CI: 1.00, 2.17] and prostate
cancer (OR = 2:05; 95% CI: 1.38, 3.03). In contrast, those exposed to the highest versus lowest intensity of outdoor ALAN were more likely to be
controls than cases, particularly for prostate cancer. Compared with those who reported sleeping in total darkness, men who slept in “quite illumi-
nated” bedrooms had a higher risk of prostate cancer (OR = 2:79; 95% CI: 1.55, 5.04), whereas women had a slightly lower risk of breast cancer
(OR = 0:77; 95% CI: 0.39, 1.51).
CONCLUSION: Both prostate and breast cancer were associated with high estimated exposure to outdoor ALAN in the blue-enriched light spectrum.

Introduction
The increase of artificial light at night (ALAN) in cities has altered
the natural light levels in the nocturnal environment and extended
human activities into the usually dark hours (Falchi et al. 2011). It
has been estimated that more than 80% of the world population
(99% of the population from the United States and Europe) and
almost one-fifth of the world terrain is under light-polluted skies
that suffer from an excessive, misdirected, or obtrusive artificial
(usually outdoor) light (Cinzano et al. 2001; Falchi et al. 2011,
2016). Migration toward the light emitting diode (LED) technology
in urban settings has resulted to an increase in ALAN and particu-
larly an increase of the blue light spectrum due to the use of white
LED as the new urban light standard (Kyba et al. 2017).
In 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) concluded that shift work that involves circadian disruption

 is “probably carcinogenic to humans” (IARC 2007). The epidemi-
ological evidence mostly focused on breast cancer, but since 2007
studies on night shift have examined other cancers and several
have identified modest increased risks for prostate cancer (Behrens
et al. 2017), particularly among advanced tumors (Papantoniou
et al. 2016). Several mechanisms related to the circadian system
and exposure to light at night were examined by IARC involving
suppression of melatonin production, alterations of sleep–activity
patterns, and deregulation of circadian genes. Depending on light
intensity and wavelength, exposure to ALAN may affect human
health by decreasing the production and secretion of pineal melato-
nin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytriptamine), which is a hormone normally
produced in the dark phase of the 24-h cycle (Brainard et al. 2001;
Chang et al. 2014; Escofet and Bará 2015; Thapan et al. 2013).
Melatonin is related to cancer through several pathways (IARC
2010; Korkmaz and Reiter 2008), including effects on estrogen-
receptor positive human breast cancer cells (Hill et al. 2015).
Studies in day and night shift workers have shown a delay in peak
time and lower melatonin levels in night workers with mean uri-
nary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) levels of 10:9 ng=mg creati-
nine per hour compared with 15.4 in day workers (Papantoniou
et al. 2014). Data showing similar patterns in the general popula-
tion in relation to ALAN are limited. For example, subjects reading
light-emitting devices (e.g., eBook) before sleeping compared
with a printed book, took longer to fall asleep, had reduced evening
sleepiness, reduced melatonin secretion, later timing of their circa-
dian clock, and reduced next-morning alertness (Chang et al.
2015).
Genetic background has been shown to be related to preferen-
tial day or night profile (chronotype) (Jones et al. 2016), adaptation
to night work, and changes in sleep and wake schedules. For
instance, Papantoniou et al. (2014) identified the lowest melatonin
levels among night shift workers with the morning-preference
chronotype, an individual characteristic that may relate to night
shift work adaptation. Age, sex, and probably other factors such as
living indoors and nighttime illumination (Roenneberg and
Merrow 2016) or personality traits (Antypa et al. 2017) may also
be related to chronotype.
The IARC evaluation examined occupational rather than envi-
ronmental exposures and only a few studies, most of them based on
ecological comparisons, have measured the direct impact of
ALAN in cities on circadian rhythms and hormone-dependent can-
cers. Nighttime satellite photometry, collected in the framework of
the U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program—
Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS), has been used for
mapping sky brightness and built surfaces (Falchi 1999; Cinzano
et al. 2000). Even though data obtained from satellite images are
only able to detect the intensity of light but not to measure the spec-
trum of nighttime lighting emissions, different studies used this
source of information to link the ALAN intensities captured by
DMSP-OLS with incidence rates of breast and prostate cancer and
found a significant positive association (Kloog et al. 2009, 2010;
Keshet-Sitton et al. 2017). Rybnikova et al. (2015, 2016), reana-
lyzed Kloog et al.’s work, using GLOBOCAN (US-DMSP and
World Bank’s 2002 and 2012 databases), controlling for several
country-level predictors including birth rates, percent of urban
population, and per capita GDP and electricity consumption. They
found a significant positive breast and prostate cancer–ALAN
association once the data were reorganized in geographic clusters
of similarly developed countries. In addition, further studies
(Bauer et al. 2013; Hurley et al. 2014; Keshet-Sitton et al. 2016;
Kloog et al. 2011) combined indoor ALAN estimates, based on
questionnaire data regarding sleep habits and use of nighttime
lighting, with estimates of outdoor ALAN obtained from DMSP-
OLS or also from questionnaires, to evaluate the association with
breast cancer, concluding that decreasing nighttime light exposure
diminished breast cancer risk. A recent analysis of the Nurses’
Health Study II (James et al. 2017) reported a small increased
breast cancer risk among premenopausal women associated with
exposure to residential outdoor light at night.
We have shown in a population based case–control study in
Spain (estudio español multi-caso control; MCC-Spain) an over-
all higher risk of breast and prostate cancer among night shift
workers (Papantoniou et al. 2015a, 2016). In the present analysis,
we evaluated in the same study among non–night shift workers,
the association of breast cancer and prostate cancer risk with the
level of reported indoor ALAN during sleeping time and with
remotely sensed levels of outdoor ALAN light intensity and color
(spectral content), individually assigned to geocoded addresses of
study participants. In this study we did not measure nighttime
melatonin levels among subjects.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
The MCC-Spain is a population based multicase–control study
(http://www.mccspain.org) on frequent tumors in Spain that
includes cases and population controls from the catchment
areas of 23 hospitals in 12 regions and assesses five types of
cancer (breast, colorectal, prostate, and stomach cancers and
chronic lymphocytic leukemia) using the same series of popula-
tion controls for all cases (Castaño-Vinyals et al. 2015). In this
analysis we include subjects from the 11 regions enrolling
breast and prostate cancer cases and corresponding controls
(Asturias, Barcelona, Cantabria, Girona, Granada, Guipúzcoa,
Huelva, León, Madrid, Navarra, and Valencia). Images from the
International Space Station (ISS) used to evaluate outdoor
ALAN were only available for the two largest centers, Barcelona
and Madrid, and tables in the main text present results only for
these two centers.
Recruitment of incident cancer cases and population controls
20–85 y of age took place from 2008 to 2013. We recruited cases
with an incident histologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer, liv-
ing in the catchment area of each selected hospital for at least 6
months. Controls were randomly selected from the Primary
Health Centers located in the same catchment area as cases
with no history of cancer and were frequency matched to cases
by sex, age in 5-y age groups and study area. They were con-
tacted on behalf of their General Practitioner and invited to
participate in the study. Excluded subjects included those inca-
pable of participating in the interview due to communication
difficulties (i.e., mental or speaking problems) and/or excess
impairment of physical ability. Response rates varied by center
with an average 72% response rate among cases and 52%
among controls with valid telephone numbers in the primary
health centers’ rosters. All models were adjusted for individual
and area-based socioeconomic status to, in part, take into
account a potential bias from differential participation among
cases and controls.
To analyze the effect of ALAN during sleeping time, we
excluded subjects who had ever worked in night-shift (i.e., work-
ing schedule that involved working partly or entirely between
0000 and 0600 hours, at least three times per month) so as to
avoid potential exposure misclassification given that, at least
some nights, those subjects would not be at their home. Due to
this condition we excluded 224 breast cases, 208 female controls,
327 prostate cases, and 353 male controls.
The population having both indoor and outdoor ALAN
exposure estimates from Barcelona and Madrid includes 380
breast cancer cases, 490 female controls, 359 prostate cancer

 cases and 544 male controls (Table 1). The study population
(Barcelona, Madrid, and all other areas) for which only indoor
ALAN estimates are presented includes 1,219 breast cancer
cases, 1,385 female controls, 623 prostate cancer cases, and 879
male controls.
Data collection. Data was collected through face-to-face
interviews performed by trained personnel and included lifetime
residential and occupational history. Information on other risk fac-
tors for breast or prostate cancer was collected, including age, edu-
cational level, family socioeconomic level, race, body mass
index (BMI), family history of cancer, smoking status, and in
women reproductive history (see full questionnaire at http://www.
mccspain.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Quest_MCCSpain.pdf).
Chronotype was assessed through a follow-up telephone interview
and the use of the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ).
Chronotype (MSFcorr) was estimated as the mid-sleep time on free
days [MSF = ðsleep onset on free day + sleep duration on free dayÞ=
2Þ], corrected for oversleep on free days compared with working
days [MSFcorr = MSF −ðsleep duration on free day − sleep duration
on a working dayÞ=2]. Chronotype was assessed using categorical
variables with three categories: morning type (corresponding to
MSF <0400 hours); intermediate/neither type (MSF = 0401–0500
hours); and evening type (MSF >0500 hours) (Papantoniou et al.
2015a, 2016).
The MCC-Spain study followed the national and international
directives, namely the deontological code and declaration of
Helsinki and the Spanish law on confidentiality of data (Ley
Organica 15/1999 de 13 Diciembre de Proteccion de Datos de
carácter personal; LOPD). All subjects who agreed to participate
and fulfilled the eligibility criteria signed an informed consent
form before participating in the study. The corresponding ethics
committees of the participating centers and hospitals reviewed
the protocol of the study.
Tumor subphenotypes. Clinical information from medical
records analyzed for 350 breast cancer cases, including tumor hor-
monal receptor status, and for 355 prostate cases with information
on Gleason score. Breast cancer cases were subclassified into three
subtypes based on local pathology reports: a) estrogen-receptor
positive and progesterone-receptor positive (ER=PR + ) tumors
with luminal human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative
(HER2 − ) and estrogen-receptor positive (ER + ) or progesterone-
receptor positive (PR + ); b) HER2 + tumors with luminal human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2 + ) irrespective
of estrogen or progesterone receptor results; c) TN (triple-nega-
tive) tumors with ER −, PR −, and HER2 − . Prostate cancer cases
were evaluated by degree of differentiation/grade using the pros-
tate biopsy Gleason score (≤7: well or moderately differentiated;
≥8: poorly differentiated/more aggressive).

 ALAN Exposures
We evaluated indoor ALAN through the MCC-Spain question-
naire where it was defined as the level of light in the bedroom dur-
ing sleeping time when the participants were at 40 y of age. This
was a subjective measure requested during the face-to-face inter-
view using a four-digit Likert scale: a) total darkness, b) almost
dark, c) dim light, and d) quite illuminated. No additional specifica-
tion of the scale was provided. For subjects <40 y of age, we
recorded their response at the age of diagnosis or interview. We an-
alyzed responses for subjects who were 40 y of age to capture aver-
age exposures in adult life but had requested the same information
for indoor light during the last year before diagnosis or interview.
Responses were similar to those reported for subjects 40 y of age
with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.90 for breast cancer study
subjects and 0.91 for prostate cancer study subjects.
For the evaluation of outdoor ALAN, we used images of
Madrid (Figure 1) and Barcelona (Figure 2) taken by astronauts
aboard the ISS in 2012 (ISS030-E-82052) and 2013 (ISS035-E-
23385), respectively. The images were downloaded from the
Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit, NASA Johnson Space
Center (https://eol.jsc.nasa.gov). There were no major changes in
the two cities on their street lighting from 2001 to 2014, accord-
ing to local experts, ISS images, and statistics of the energy con-
sumption of the town halls (Sánchez de Miguel et al. 2014).
Because there are no ISS images for earlier years and for the pe-
riod 2001–2014, we evaluated available images and selected
those appearing most informative that corresponded to the years
2012–2013. Those images were taken with commercial Digital
Single-Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras providing image informa-
tion in three spectral bands in the visual range [red (R), green
(G), blue (B); i.e., RGB], and with the European Space Agency
NightPod system (installed in 2012). These instruments may pro-
vide ground-level resolutions of <10 m (Kyba 2016), but in the
images included in the present analysis, the spatial resolution was
about 30 m. The images were calibrated applying the procedure
described in Sánchez de Miguel (2015) by using existing data-
bases of standard typical emission spectra of known types of out-
door lighting (e.g., white LED, low-pressure sodium, metal
halide) and inferring the observed lighting type from the RGB
signature (Sánchez de Miguel 2007; Sánchez de Miguel et al.
2014). More specifically, we used the G/R ratio to proceed to the
classification of the ground-level spectral type of the lamps, and
then we used a lamp spectral database to estimate the ground-
based spectrum of the light emissions (see Figure S1). In the esti-
mation we assume the atmospheric transfer function and the
ground reflectance to not much affect the classification process.
An estimate of the visual light was done using a relationship
between the ratio of the photopic visual light over the green band
fluxes detected from the ISS (VðkÞ=G) to the ratio of the green to
the red bands (G/R). This relationship has been determined for a
variety of lighting technologies by Sánchez de Miguel (2015)
(see Figure S2).
We also calculated an index of outdoor blue light spectrum
using an approach described in Aubé et al. (2013) to calculate the
melatonin suppression index (MSI) at each pixel of the image.
The MSI is related to exposure to blue light and is a metric

 designed to scale the spectral interaction between a given light
spectrum and the published measurements of the melatonin sup-
pression action spectrum (MSAS) (Brainard et al. 2001; Thapan
et al. 2001). The MSI has been designed to separate the effect of
the shape of a spectrum from its averaged luminous intensity by
making use of the MSAS. The MSI determinations were done for
the house location of each participant involved in the study and
derived as a number generally ranging from 0 to 1. The MSI rep-
resents to what extent the spectrum shape of different lights are
efficient to suppress the melatonin production compared with the
spectrum shape of the International Commission on Illumination
(CIE) illuminant D65 that has been arbitrarily set to the highest
value (one). The CIE Standard Illuminant D65 corresponds
approximately to the average midday sunlight in Western and
Northern Europe.
Therefore, two quantitative indices of outdoor ALAN were
estimated from space based color imagery: a) outdoor visual-
ALAN, as a proxy for luminance; and b) MSI, which is highly
linked to blue light spectrum and melatonin suppression action
spectrum.
A Geographic Information System (GIS), QGIS (QGIS
Development Team 2015), was used to assign outdoor ALAN
levels of visual light (outdoor visual-ALAN) and MSI to each
individual cases and controls locations from the MCC-Spain
study, selecting the geocoded residence with the longest duration
for each participant. Residential mobility was low in this study
population and the longest residence was, on average, >30 y and
coincided with the last residence for 80.2% of the subjects.
Statistical Analysis
We applied unconditional logistic regression and calculated adjusted
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in separate
and combined models of indoor and/or outdoor ALAN exposures
for each of the two cancers.
Models were adjusted a priori (basic adjustment) for age, cen-
ter (participant cities), and educational level (less than primary
school, primary school, secondary school and university); breast
cancer models also included adjustment for menopausal status
(pre- or postmenopausal based on self-report in combination with
additional criteria, specifically number of menstruations during the
last year, age of stopping menstruation, and cause of nonmenstru-
ating, including surgeries). A further adjustment was also carried
out including the previous variables in addition to the following:
BMI, [treated as a categorical variable: normal weight (0 to <25),
overweight (25–30), obese (≥30)]; socioeconomic status score
[ranged from 0 to 7 and categorized in three levels: high (scores
6–7), medium (scores 3–5), low (scores 0–3); the score was based
on a combination of information on education of parents (range
0–2), socioeconomic status derived from the occupation of the sub-
ject (range 0–2), and education of the subject (range 0–3)];
urban vulnerability to measure socioeconomic status at area level
coded from 0 to 1 [Ministry of Public Works (Spain); http://atlas

breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men in first-degree
relatives; smoking habits (ever smoked at least 100 cigarettes or 360

 exposure. Adjustment for alcohol made minimal difference (data not
shown) and we present results without adjustment because 10.7% of
the study population had missing values for alcohol. In all models,
we completed case analyses such that observations with missing
data for any covariate were excluded from models. Outdoor ALAN
variables were analyzed as categorical variables using tertiles of ex-
posure among controls. We used generalized additive models
(GAMs) to examine the shape of the dose-response relationship
between outdoor ALAN exposure and risk of cancer.
We explored effect modification by menopausal status using
the likelihood ratio test, comparing the model including the inter-
action term to the model without the interaction term. ORs for
light exposure variables by menopausal status and chronotype are
reported from the stratified models.
We analyzed effects on subphenotypes of the diseases using
multinomial logistic regression, applying the basic adjustment for
breast and prostate cancer. Chronotype was also examined in a
stratified analysis. In a sensitivity analysis, we provide results
that include subjects who reported also having done night shift
work.
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata S.E. (version
12.1; StataCorporation) and the R software environment (R Core
Development Team).
Results
Study Population
The distribution of potential breast and prostate cancer risk fac-
tors among 1,773 participants for indoor and outdoor ALAN
models (Barcelona and Madrid) are shown in Table 1. Around
17% of the female population and 21% of the male population
were obese, with a BMI of ≥30. Female cases were slightly
younger than controls (56 vs. 60 y of age), less often postmeno-
pausal (64% vs. 77%), and more frequently reported family his-
tory of breast cancer (18% vs. 10%) compared with controls.
Male cases also more frequently reported family history of pros-
tate cancer than controls (17% vs. 7%). The chronotype question-
naire was completed by 99% of breast and prostate cancer cases,
and by 98% and 96% of breast and prostate cancer controls,
respectively.
The same information is provided in Table S1 for the total
MCC-Spain population (n = 4,106) for which only indoor ALAN
information is available. For nearly all variables, distributions are
very similar to those presented in Table 1 for the main study pop-
ulation (n = 1,773, Barcelona and Madrid).
Indoor and Outdoor ALAN Models
Visual light data (units proportional to the luminance, a quantity
expressed in units of Cd=m2) had an average of 0.064 [SD (mini-
mum, maximum): 0.034 (0.010, 0.219)] for breast cancer cases
and 0.065 [0.034 (0.009, 0.225)] for controls, and an average of
0.061 [0.032 (0.005, 0.175)] for prostate cancer cases and 0.066
[0.033 (0.002, 0.225)] for corresponding controls. Values of MSI
had an average of 0.155 [0.051 (0.053, 0.407)] for breast cancer
cases and 0.150 [0.045 (0.041, 0.361)] for controls, and an aver-
age of 0.153 [0.051 (0.025, 0.413)] for prostate cancer cases, and
0.148 [0.044 (0.017, 0.365)] for corresponding controls. No cor-
relation was found between indoor ALAN (categorical variable)

determination (R2) of 2.36% for visual and 1.62% for MSI for
breast cancer, and corresponding R2 of 2.95% and 0.99% for pros-
tate cancer. There was no correlation between outdoor ALAN-
visual and MSI (blue light spectrum) with Spearman correlation
coefficients of 0.1 for breast cancer and 0.06 for prostate cancer
cases and controls.
ORs for indoor and outdoor ALAN and breast or prostate can-
cer in the Barcelona and Madrid study populations are shown for
in Table 2. Patterns of ORs were similar for the basic and fully
adjusted models; ORs for the fully adjusted models are reported
in the text unless otherwise noted. Sleeping in more illuminated
bedrooms (indoor ALAN) compared with sleeping in total dark-
ness was positively associated with prostate cancer (OR = 2:79;
95% CI: 1.55, 5.04) but was inversely associated breast cancer
(OR = 0:77; 95% CI: 0.39, 1.51). Exposure to the higher versus
lowest tertile of blue light spectrum (outdoor ALAN-MSI) was
positively associated with both breast (OR = 1:47; 95% CI: 1.00,
2.17) and prostate cancer (OR = 2:05; 95% CI: 1.38, 3.03) can-
cers. The positive association between the highest versus lowest
tertile of blue light spectrum (MSI) and breast cancer was slightly
higher in postmenopausal women (OR = 1:31, 95% CI: 0.84,
2.03) compared with premenopausal women (OR = 1:09; 95%
CI: 0.57, 2.09) although this difference was not statistically sig-
nificant (p for interaction = 0:7) (see Table S2). Visual light (out-
door ALAN) was inversely associated with prostate cancer
(OR = 0:56; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.84 for the highest vs. lowest tertile),
but the association was close to the null for breast cancer.
In GAM models evaluating outdoor ALAN (overall light vis-
ual and MSI-blue light) (Figure 3), all p-values for departure of
linearity for were not statistically significant (p < 0:2). Similar to
the analysis by exposure tertiles, estimated associations with out-
door ALAN-MSI (blue light) were positive and approximately
linear for both prostate and breast cancer, whereas associations
with outdoor ALAN-visual were approximately linear and inverse
for prostate cancer, and essentially null for breast cancer.
Associations between indoor ALAN in the entire MCC-Spain
study population (see Table S3) were similar to estimates based
on participants from the Barcelona and Madrid centers only
(Table 2). Prostate cancer was positively associated with the
highest level of indoor illumination during bedtime compared
with no indoor illumination (OR = 1:80; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.76), but
there was no evidence of an association with breast cancer
(OR = 0:94; 95% CI: 95%: 0.70, 1.27). Estimated associations for
breast and prostate cancer in the Barcelona and Madrid study
populations were consistent with the primary analyses when par-
ticipants who reported ever working a night shift were included
in models that were adjusted for night shift work as a covariate,
as well as age, center, education, all light exposure variables, and
(for breast cancer) menopausal status (see Table S4).

 ALAN and outdoor ALAN-MSI (blue light) with prostate cancer
indicated higher ORs for evening types compared with intermedi-
ate or morning types, but these comparisons were based on small
number of subjects and tests for interaction were not statistically
significant (Table 3). There were no clear patterns by chronotype
observed for breast cancer. Results on indoor ALAN for the total
MCC-Spain population by chronotype are shown in Table S5 and
are consistent with those observed in the population of Barcelona
and Madrid.
Breast cancers that were estrogen- or progesterone-receptor
positive but Her2 negative (267 cases total) were positively asso-
ciated with the highest versus lowest tertile of outdoor ALAN-
MSI (OR = 1:26; 95% CI: 0.8, 1.88), but associations were close
to the null for Her2 positive breast cancers (57 cases total) and
inverse for triple negative tumors (26 cases total) (Table 4). For
prostate cancer, associations with outdoor ALAN-MSI were simi-
lar for more aggressive (Gleason score ≥7) and less aggressive
(Gleason score <7) tumors (Table 4).
Discussion
We evaluated the association between exposure to indoors and
outdoors ALAN during sleep time and breast and prostate cancer
risk, two cancers that have been associated with circadian disrup-
tion (IARC 2010; Behrens et al. 2017). We found that prostate
cancer was positively associated with outdoor light at night in the
blue light spectrum and with self-reported indoor light at night,
but was inversely associated with outdoor light in the visible
spectrum. Breast cancer also was associated with outdoor light in
the blue spectrum, but was not associated with outdoor light in
the visible spectrum or with self-reported indoor light at night.
We did not find clear differences in associations with exposures
to light at night according to chronotype. In this study, we applied
more elaborate methods for the evaluation of light exposure com-
pared with previous studies, but exposure assessment remains a
key issue when examining the potential health effects of ALAN
in human studies.
Exposure to ALAN is ubiquitous and whether the spread of
exposure to ALAN may increase cancer risk and how this could
be prevented are public health issues. Exposure to short wave-
length light color during the hours before bedtime (Gringras et al.
2015) has been shown to suppress nocturnal melatonin produc-
tion (Cajochen et al. 2005; Chang et al. 2014), which, in turn,
could be associated with an increased risk of hormone-dependent
type of cancers such as breast and prostate cancer (Stevens and
Zhu 2015).
Estimates for outdoor light were based on ISS images in
2012–2013 that were selected as the most representative of the
period examined. ISS light data were not available for early peri-
ods prior to the commencement of the study, although this mis-
match in timing of exposure assessment and study inclusion may
be less important than expected. There are no major changes in
Barcelona and Madrid on their street lighting from 2003 to 2014,
according to local experts and ISS images, and statistics of the
energy consumption of the town halls (Sánchez de Miguel et al.
2014). Except for major street light replacements like those hap-
pening in Milan or Madrid in 2014, the street lights in many
western European cities have been stable for decades, although
many cities across Europe are recently experiencing marked
increases in nighttime brightness (Bennie et al. 2014), especially
with the massive arrival and exponential growth of LEDs in the
way of replacing the incandescent and high-pressure sodium
lamps (Sánchez de Miguel et al. 2017).
Existing studies examining ALAN exposures and cancer risk
rates have relied almost exclusively on satellite data, primarily
from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational
Linescan System (DMSP/OLS; e.g., Cinzano et al. 2001, Bennie
et al. 2014) and more recently the Visible Infrared Imaging
Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with its Day-Night Band camera
onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi
NPP) satellite (e.g., Baugh et al. 2013). In particular, the satellite
sensors from which the data have been obtained are effectively
color blind; that is, they are able to detect the intensity of light

 integrated across a range of wavelengths but not to measure the
spectrum of nighttime lighting emissions. Moreover both satellite
platforms are insensitive to the blue content of the light. As a con-
sequence, very little is known about the spatial and temporal dy-
namics of the spectrum of artificial nighttime lighting systems
(Gaston et al. 2015). This is critical for at least two reasons. First,
almost all known environmental impacts of artificial nighttime
lighting are sensitive to the spectrum of that lighting, including
melatonin production (Aubé et al. 2013). Second, these changes in
physiological parameters may in turn influence circadian rhythms
and, hence, the timing of sleep, blood pressure regulation, and sea-
sonal reproduction and the role of melatonin as an antioxidant
(Korkmaz and Reiter 2008), with consequences for the prevalence
of some kinds of cancer (e.g., Cajochen et al. 2005).
We applied new methods now available that make it feasible to
convert ISS images with simple three-band spectral information
into ecological risk maps, using known spectral responses of key
physiological and ecological processes with a higher spatial resolu-
tion (up to 10 m), rather than those images obtained from the
VIIRS/DNB platform (750 m) or DMSP/OLS (5 km) (Elvidge
et al. 2013). In common with other remotely sensed data on
ALAN, the maps we produced also represent light emitted or
reflected upwards towards the sensor, assuming that this is a good
proxy for the intensity and density of light sources at ground level.
It would be interesting in further studies to include information
about the aerosol content of the atmosphere in order to correct the
ISS images by differential atmospheric absorption. In this research,
we could not estimate the potential exposure reaching the retinae
of each subject. Eyelids act as filters and, actually, as color filters
transforming the incoming spectrum before reaching the retinae.
Estimating individual exposures reaching the retinae would require
an experimental design or much more extensive knowledge on
shedding and absorption of blue light so as to develop quantitative
exposure models.
We found evidence of positive associations for breast and
prostate cancer with exposure to outdoor light in the blue spec-
trum (MSI), whereas exposure to outdoor light in the visible
spectrum (i.e., luminance) was associated with lower odds of
prostate cancer and was not clearly related to breast cancer.
Visual light estimates are based on what the cameras detect from
space, although there is a part of the light emitted that might
never enter the houses. Moreover, the luminance at the window
level is linked in a complex way to ground-based light emissions
while taking into account atmospheric-induced optical distortion
as well as spectral and geometrical transformations from the
underlying ground surfaces and obstacles (Aubé 2015). In other
words, the light output pattern of the light fixtures cannot be
assessed from space, and it is possible that the upward light
remains weakly correlated to the horizontal light that enters the
houses. There is less of this problem with MSI. The only varia-
tion on the spectrum can come from different combinations of
direct and reflected lights as a function of the angle; however,
generally the most important contribution to the light entering a
window is the direct light, and MSI does not depend on the angle
for that component. Visual response that we and others have used
to evaluate the outdoor visual-ALAN is not necessarily well cor-
related to blue light, which is the light spectrum most likely to be
relevant when evaluating biological responses related to cancer.
In this population there was no correlation between estimates of
outdoor visual light with blue light exposure.
We did not find clear evidence that chronotype modifies asso-
ciations between light at night and prostate or breast cancer, con-
sistent with previous findings for associations with night shift
work in the MCC-Spain study as a whole (Papantoniou et al.
2015b, 2016). Although chronotype is related to preference for
morningness or eveningness, and has been hypothesized as a
potential modifier of effects of ALAN exposure (Erren et al.
2017), the potential influence of chronotype on cancer risk is still
unknown. We found a higher risk of prostate cancer among par-
ticipants with a more illuminated bedroom at night (indoor
ALAN). There was no association between outdoor visual-
ALAN and indoor ALAN. This lack of correlation could be due
to the use of shutters at night among subjects with high outdoor
visual-ALAN, or perhaps a lack of relationship between the light
reaching the ISS and the light reaching the house’s windows.
Similar results were described in a previous study carried out by
Rea et al. (2011) concluding that satellite-measured sky bright-
ness (visual light) was unrelated to personal light exposures. In
addition, sources other than street light might be contributing to
indoor ALAN exposures, such as light coming from neighbors or
the use of portable electronic devices with self-luminous displays
and energy-efficient lighting (LEDs). The use of such devices is
increasing and has a significant effect on decreasing melatonin
production if they are used before bedtime (Bonmati-Carrion et al.
2014; Chang et al. 2014).
In further studies it will be interesting to measure indoor light
levels rather than using only questionnaire-based methodology,
which is more subjective although it may capture a longer time
span of exposure. Improvements in modelling exposure such as
the inclusion of the height of the residence buildings and of dif-
ferent obstacles in the street (e.g., trees or other buildings that
could protect subjects from the received outdoor light) would
have been advantageous but also should be validated with light
measurements. Such approaches could help explain our observa-
tions where outdoor visual-ALAN (i.e., luminance) was associ-
ated with no or a negative effect that is opposite to that observed
for blue light (MSI index), which might still penetrate the cur-
tains or shutters (Aubé et al. 2013).

 Summarizing, in this study we used modelled images pro-
vided by the ISS to map the spatial variation of artificial night-
time lighting exposure, including blue light spectrum, combined
with data from questionnaires on exposure to indoor light at
night, and related this information with the risk of developing the
two most common hormone dependent cancers (breast and pros-
tate). The main strengths of this study are the use of individual in-
formation rather than relying on ecological comparisons as most
other studies have and the possibility, therefore, of developing
personal estimates of exposure and adjusting for potential con-
founding factors. In addition, we used new methods for the evalu-
ation of the blue light spectrum. The main limitation of the study
is exposure misclassification because we used proxy estimates
for the evaluation of both indoor ALAN and for outdoor visual-
ALAN exposure (although not for MSI). We adjusted for socioe-
conomic status both at the individual and area level to take into
account, at least in part, a potential bias due to an association of
socioeconomic factors with urban structure and light, although it
is unlikely that this would result in differential misclassification
between cases and controls.
Conclusions
Findings from this large case–control study of two cancers that
have been associated with circadian disruption and light at
night during shift work provide some support for the influence
of ALAN for the development of cancer in the general popula-
tion. Men who reported the highest level of exposure to indoor
ALAN were at greater risk of prostate cancer than men who
reported no indoor illumination at night. Although both cancers
were less likely among those in the highest versus lowest tertile
of exposure to outdoor ALAN in the visible spectrum, outdoor
ALAN in the blue-light spectrum, which is believed to be the
most biologically relevant exposure, was positively associated
with prostate cancer and, to a lesser extent, with breast cancer.
