Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of death from cancer worldwide. Systemic chemotherapy remains the mainstay
therapeutic option for this poor prognosis cancer. Trastuzumab, the epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2 or HER2)-
antibody, is the only biological agent approved for the molecularly selected population of HER2-positive gastric cancer patients.
Over the last decade, several groups have been working for deepening into the molecular characterization of gastric cancer,
shedding some light into the heterogeneity of this tumour. The published data have broadened the landscape towards a future
molecular classification into several subtypes of gastric cancer, enabling a better selection of the optimal therapeutic strategy.
The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway plays a key role in gastric cancer pathogenesis, with 1.2%–9% of gastric
cancer patients harbouring FGFR2 amplifications. Several selective FGFR inhibitors have been developed in the last years, with
promising efficacy signals. However, there is still scarce evidence of the most reliant molecular determinants of response to
these targeted agents. Homogeneous high-level clonal FGFR2-amplification, high FGFR2 mRNA or protein levels, specific FGFR2
C3 isoform expression, FGF ligand co-overexpression or detection of FGFR2 copy number in plasma circulating tumour DNA, are
considered some of the potential predictive biomarkers to the FGFR inhibition. The successful development of highly specific
FGFR inhibitors will rely on our capacity of establishing new personalized strategies, based on a deeper knowledge of the key
alterations that drive oncogenesis in gastric cancer. Further efforts seem mandatory in order to implement accurate predictive
biomarkers in the next stages of the FGFR inhibitors development.

Introduction
Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide,
and the third leading cause of death from cancer, with nearly
723 073 deaths per year [1]. GC incidence notably varies by geo-
graphic region, with more than 70% of GC developed in low-
income countries, half of them detected in Eastern Asia.
Nearly two-thirds of newly diagnosed GC present with locally
advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis, therefore GC presents
a significant dismal prognosis. Since 1997, systemic chemotherapy
has positioned as the mainstay treatment option for these patients,
yet the number of patients who benefit from treatment is still lim-
ited [2]. Over the last 20 years, efforts have been made in order to
improve the results of initial chemotherapeutic regimens, using
combinations of platinum salts and fluoropyrimidines as the more
frequent backbone strategy with or without a third drug [3].
Nevertheless, there is still no international consensus regarding the
optimal first-line combination [4], with most of the regimens lead-
ing to a plateau in median overall survival (mOS) of 8–11.2
months [5–8].
In 2010, trastuzumab, the epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(ERBB2 or HER2)-antibody, opened the door towards a new era
of incorporating targeted agents as part of the armamentarium for
treating GC. The ToGA trial [9] showed a significantly benefit in
mOS in the subset of HER2-positive patients treated within the
cisplatinum–fluoropyrimidine–trastuzumab arm. Despite these
promising results, trastuzumab remains the only biological agent
approved for a molecularly selected population of GC patients.
During the last decade, several groups have tried to deepen
into the molecular biology of the disease, aiming to develop a

 classification of molecularly differentiated subtypes of GC
[10–14]. These classifications have shed more light on other po-
tential oncogenic alterations that may drive tumourogenesis in
GC, such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) aber-
rations. Certainly, further efforts are mandatory in order to de-
fine an optimal molecular classification of GC, allowing a
progressive implementation of it in the design of molecularly
guided clinical trials.
It is clear that there is a high unmet medical need in GC.
Within this context where new treatments with an acceptable tox-
icity profile are urgently required, the FGFR/FGF pathway arises
as a promising target to focus on in GC patients. Here we present
an overview of the FGFR/FGF axis and the rationale for develop-
ing selective pan-FGFR inhibitors (FGFRinh) in GC, depicting
the current status of different FGFRinh under development in
GC and highlighting the challenges in finding accurate predictive
biomarkers in this setting.
The FGFR/FGF pathway in gastric cancer
The FGFR/FGF cascade is a complex intracellular pathway that
controls cellular proliferation and tumour growth, angiogenesis
and dissemination. Four different membrane tyrosine kinase re-
ceptors are activated upon binding of one of the 23 different
existing ligands, leading to the transphosphorylation of the new
dimer. Subsequently, key adaptor proteins lead to downstream
activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and the
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathways [15].
Deregulated FGFR/FGF pathway plays a critical role in several
tumour types. To date, a variety of genetic aberrations of the
FGFR and ligands have been described, which distribute unevenly
across different solid malignancies [16]. Noteworthy, increased
FGFR signalling may result from different types of genetic alter-
ations: receptor gene translocations or activating point mutations
that result into a constitutively activated ligand-independent kin-
ase; gene amplifications which turn on to supraphysiological
overexpression, either of the ligand or the receptor; altered splic-
ing mechanisms leading to a paracrine or altered ligand expres-
sion [17].
In 1990, FGFR2 amplification was described for the first time,
after detecting an amplified DNA sequence from a KATO-III sig-
net ring GC cell line [18]. Recently, the comprehensive analysis of
several series has been able to identify patients harbouring this
FGFR2 amplification in a proportion ranging from 9% (Western
primary GC samples) [14] to 1.2%–4.9% (Asian primary GC
samples) [13]. The oncogenic role of the FGFR2 kinase has been
demonstrated by the selective growth inhibition of FGFR2-
amplified (FGFR2amp) cancer cell lines by using shRNA or
small-potent molecule inhibitors [19], translated into decreased
survival and tumour regression in in vivo models [20].
Furthermore, FGFR2 activating point mutations detected in GC
samples support its important role in GC tumourogenesis [21].
FGFR2 gene amplification has been described as an independent
poor prognostic factor in GC patients, associated with higher pT
and pN, lymphovascular invasion and distant metastasis [22–24].
Interestingly, genomic aberrations in HER2 (17%), MET (6%)
and FGFR2 (9%) genes account among the most frequent onco-
genic disorders described in GC patients [14]. However, these
driver alterations seem to occur in largely distinct subgroups of
GC, with very slight overlap between them [10, 11, 25]. Figure 1
depicts one of the most widely accepted molecular classifications
of GC carried out by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, positioning the subset of FGFR2amp GC patients
within the chromosomal instability (CIN) subgroup.
As increasing data suggest that up-regulation of FGFR2 signal-
ling is a key event in a subtype of GC, several FGFRinh have been
developed with special focus on this subset of GC patients.
Selective pan-FGFR inhibitors under
investigation in gastric cancer
FGFR2 amplifications have attracted significant attention as an
emerging druggable candidate alteration for the development of dir-
ected novel anticancer agents. First generation multi-tyrosine kinase
inhibitors have demonstrated antitumour activity against FGFR-
aberrant tumours [26]. However, due to their multi-targeting inhib-
ition that translated into increased toxicity and the lack of a clear
marker for predicting response, their further development has been
limited [27, 28]. Over the last 5 years, the development of a second
generation, highly selective pan-FGFR inhibitors has focused the
interest, and several phase 1 trials have been enrolling FGFR-
aberrant tumours: AZD4547 (NCT00979134) [29–32], BGJ398
(NCT01004224)
[33],
BAY1163877
(NCT01976741)

(NCT02052778)
[40]
and
GSK3052230/FP-1039 (NCT01868022) [41]. However, as shown in
Table 1, only AZD4547 has demonstrated encouraging signs of effi-
cacy among FGFR2amp GC patients so far.
AZD4547 is a small orally bioavailable selective inhibitor of the
FGFR family. AZD4547 potently inhibits the tyrosine kinase ac-
tivity of FGFR1, 2 and 3 (IC50 <5 nM) [42]. In vitro studies have
demonstrated that AZD4547 is able to suppress tumour growth
through restraining cell proliferation, inhibiting invasion and mi-
gration and inducing apoptosis in FGFR-deregulated cell lines,
with lack of antiproliferative effects in non-FGFR-aberrant cells.
Furthermore, AZD4547 has efficiently shown tumour control
in vivo in animal models, particularly in FGFR1 amplified
(FGFR1amp) squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC)
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) [43, 44] and in FGFR2amp
GC PDXs. In fact, compared with monotherapy, the combination
with certain chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel, has dem-
onstrated enhanced in vivo antitumour efficacy in GC models
[20]. This preclinical data provided a strong rationale for con-
sidering further investigation with AZD4547 as a therapeutic op-
tion for FGFR2amp tumours.
A 3-part phase 1 study of AZD4547 in patients with advanced
solid tumours was initiated (NCT00979134), aiming to: deter-
mine the maximum tolerated dose and a recommended phase 2
dose (RP2D) (part A), to evaluate the safety profile and pharma-
cokinetics (parts A and B) and to specifically assess efficacy in
FGFR-aberrant patients (part C1) [29]. FGFR gene amplification
status for enrolment in part C1 was assessed by fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) in fresh or archival tumour samples. The
RP2D was established as 80 mg bi-daily (b.i.d.) in a continuous
dosing regimen, with dose-limiting toxicities including stomatitis

 and mucositis, liver function tests deranged, hyperphosphatemia
and renal failure. Five patients benefitted from AZD4547 in part
C1, with four patients achieving stabilizations for �24 weeks
(one breast cancer and one sqNSCLC, two bladder carcinomas
[45]). Of note, a partial response was reported in an FGFR1amp
sqNSCLC. Detailed biomarker analysis using protein FGFR ex-
pression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), gene expression by
Nanostring and targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), re-
vealed that 7 out of 21 patients included in part C1 had high
FGFR1amp (ratio FGFR: centromeric probe �3), and 3 of these
were among the ones that presented long stabilizations or tumour
reduction. Interestingly, NGS from the responding sqNSCLC pa-
tient confirmed high copy number FGFR1 amplification, to-
gether with amplification of 11q13 genes FGF3/4/19. A breast
cancer patient that achieved durable stabilization with shrinkage
of 25% in target lesions, presented high FGFR1 amplification and
high FGFR1 protein expression [30]. In light of these promising
results, Part C2 and C3 started enrolling FGFR1amp sqNSCLC
[31] and FGFR2amp GC patients, respectively [32].
A total of 238 advanced GC/GOJ patients were prospectively
pre-screened by FISH in part C3; 38 patients (16%) met the pre-
specified FGFR2 threshold for amplification (FGFR: centromeric
ratio �2), with only 13 patients being finally enrolled into this co-
hort. Six patients had high FGFR2 amplification (ratio �2.8), 3
had low amplification (ratio >2 to � 2.8) and 4 presented a cluster
type (>10% cells with clusters of FGFR amplification). Despite
observing an encouraging partial response (cluster type patient)
and four stabilizations (one cluster type and three highly amplified
patients), the study did not meet the pre-specified overall response
endpoint, and the GC expansion was discontinued [32].
Early encouraging signs seen in this phase 1 study provided the
evidence that AZD4547 had antitumour activity and caused
pharmacologic FGFR inhibition at this dose, as increases in plas-
matic phosphate levels were seen, which led to its further devel-
opment in a phase 2 study. Of note, this phase 2 study was
initiated before completing the enrolment and data analysis of
the phase 1. The SHINE study (NCT01457846) aimed to assess
further safety and efficacy of AZD4547 in FGFR2amp or polyso-
mic GC after first line platinum-based failure [46]. Primary end-
point was progression-free survival (PFS), with FGFR2 status
determined by central FISH. Patients were defined as FGFR2 pol-
ysomic (FISH 4/5), low (FISH 6, ratio >2) or high (FISH 6, ratio
�5)

patients screened positive for FGFR2. Of these 71 FGFR2 pa-
tients, 41 patients were randomized in the AZD4547 arm (9 low
and 9 high FGFR2amp) and 30 patients (10 low and 5 high
FGFR2amp) in the chemotherapy arm. Thirty-five polysomic pa-
tients were enrolled, considering that they were less likely to dis-
play true oncogene addiction. Disappointingly, median PFS was
1.5 months for AZD4547 arm versus 2.3 months for paclitaxel
arm. However, it has to be considered that these results included
only a very small cohort of patients and were presented as a result
of an ad hoc interim analysis. Noteworthy, careful review of FISH
mapping analysis revealed that four out of seven highly
FGFR2amp tumour samples were in reality amplified in roughly
20% of cells from tumour section, although no patients with clo-
nal highly FGFR2amp were detected. Only 21% of FGFR2amp

Figure 1. FGFR2 amplification defines a subset of GC patients. The Cancer Genome Atlas Network has proposed a molecular classification of
GC into four subtypes: the Ebstein–Barr Virus positive tumours (EBV 8%), characterized by recurrent PI3KCA mutations, high DNA hypermethy-
lation, amplification of JAK2/PDL1 and PDL2/CDKN2A silencing; MicroSatellite Unstable tumours (MSI 22%), characterized by high rates of mu-
tations, including genes that encode oncogenic proteins; genomically stable tumours (GS 20%), enriched by diffuse histology tumours,
CDH1/RHOA mutations and some fusions in the CLDN18 family; tumours with chromosomal instability (CIN 50%), enriched by intestinal hist-
ology, which show increased amplification of several tyrosine-kinase receptor genes. Among the CIN subgroup we could find the three more
frequent non-overlapping molecular alterations described in the overall population of GC: HER2 (17%), FGFR2 (9%) and MET (6%)
overexpression.

 samples translated into high FGFR2 mRNA expression assessed
by Nanostring.
Unfortunately, although mild signs of effectiveness emerged
from early phase 1 and 2 studies testing AZD4547 in FGFR2amp
GC patients, none of them met the pre-established efficacy crite-
ria, and both were deemed negative studies. Retrospective careful
evaluation of the molecular characteristics of the responders is es-
sential for gaining a better understanding of the oncogenic role of
the FGFR2 pathway in GC, and for rationally guiding the identifi-
cation of predictive biomarkers to FGFRinh.
Predictive biomarkers to FGFR inhibition in
gastric cancer
Interestingly, from the data published one may intuit that not all
FGFR2amp GC patients respond to the FGFR inhibition. As we
gain more scientific evidence of the role of FGFR2 amplification
in GC and the therapeutic potential of FGFRinh, many questions
remain to be answered: Is there any specific threshold of FGFR2
amplification for benefitting from an FGFRinh? Do we need a
specific pattern of FGFR2 amplification distribution? Is it enough
with the FGFR2 gene amplification or do we need instead FGFR2
mRNA/protein high expression? Could a determined FGFR2 iso-
form represent a more sensitive predictive biomarker? Is FGF lig-
and overexpression mandatory? Could FGFR2 copy number
alterations (CNA) detected in circulating free DNA (cfDNA) pre-
dict response to FGFRinh?
If we recall the pivotal study that led to the approval of trastu-
zumab in GC [9], there were subsets of HER2-amplified
(HER2amp) patients that seemed not to benefit from the add-
ition of the targeted agent. A detailed post hoc analysis of the
HER2 protein expression in these subgroups of patients revealed
that those HER2amp tumours that did not respond had low pro-
tein expression (HER2 IHC 0 or IHC 1þ), despite presenting
positive FISH for gene amplification. Of note, in this ToGA study
patients were considered HER2amp according to a FISH cut off
HER2: CEP17 �2. Since then, GC patients are considered
HER2amp (IHC 3þ or IHC 2þ/ISHþ by ratio �2) using the
defined criteria for detection of HER2 amplification, narrowing
the selection criteria to those HER2-positive patients that ob-
tained higher benefit in the ToGA study. Notice that this consen-
sus was extrapolated from revisiting the criteria for HER2amp
breast cancer patients [47]. Modifications in GC HER2 interpret-
ation were mandated by clear differences in the physiology (baso-
lateral/lateral staining versus whole round membrane) and
heterogeneity (different percentage of positive cells comparing
resected primary specimens versus metastatic biopsies) of gastric
tumours compared with breast tumours [48]. Noteworthy, there
is no consensus yet regarding the optimal criteria for considering
a GC FGFR2amp.
To date, most of the initial studies enrolling FGFR2amp pa-
tients have established an arbitrary ratio cut off of � 2 for defin-
ing the FGFR gene amplification by FISH. But, do we really know
whether we can extrapolate the same threshold used in
HER2amp GC for FGFR2amp patients? Bearing this observation
in mind, and the molecular characteristics of the initial re-
sponders seen in previous mentioned studies with AZD4547, an-
other phase 2 proof-of-concept (POC) study of AZD4547 with
FGFR amplified tumours was initiated (NCT01795768). This was
an open label non-randomised Simon 2 stage study carried out
only in the UK centres, aiming to assess the efficacy of AZD4547
80 mg b.i.d. (2 weeks on/1 week off schedule) monotherapy and
the subsequent molecular changes in tumour biopsies. The initial
intermittent dosing schedule was subsequently amended to a
continuous dosing scheme. Three independent cohorts were as-
sessed, and the FGFR2amp GC/GOJ cohort required centrally
verified FGFR2amp by FISH (inclusion criteria ratio >2.2).
Initially the primary endpoint was correlation between change in
tumour diameter on 8-week CT scan and change in pERK levels
comparing pre-treatment and day 10–14 biopsy samples [49].
However, the primary endpoint was changed from PD knock-
down of pERK to response rate (RR). Furthermore, PET-CT was
carried out at baseline, day 14 and 2-months under treatment,
and a thorough biomarker analysis was planned in tumour and
plasma, including MIRAX digital FISH imaging, NGS on CNA,
FGFR2 gene expression by Nanostring and protein expression by
IHC. FGFR CNA was detected in plasma cfDNA by using a drop-
let digital polymerase chain reaction system.
Twelve out of one hundred thirty-five pre-screened GC pa-
tients were positive, with seven of them (5%) presenting high
FGFR2 amplification levels (ratio >5). This study met its primary
endpoint, with a confirmed RR of 33% in the GC cohort (3 re-
sponders out of 9 FGFR2amp GC treated). One of these three GC
confirmed responders maintained response for >10 months
[50]. Remarkably, all the three responding patients presented
high copy number FGFR2 gene amplification, and this was asso-
ciated with a significant higher expression of both FGFR2 mRNA
and
protein
levels
evaluated
on

biopsies.
Furthermore, using in situ heterogeneity mapping (MIRAX digi-
tal FISH) two out of these three responders presented clonal
homogeneous FGFR2 amplification (>99% of the tumour cells
in the section sample were amplified), whilst non-responding pa-
tients were characteristically heterogeneous for FGFR2 amplifica-
tion distribution. Unfortunately, there was not enough tissue for
biomarker assessment from the third responder. Together, all
these data suggested that high-level FGFR clonal amplification is
key predictive biomarker for FGFRinh, at least in FGFR2amp tu-
mours [51].
The fact that only 5% of total pre-screened GC patients were
highly FGFR2amp (7 out of 135 patients) in this study, indicates
that this small patient population may represent a challenge to
overcome in future steps of the FGFRinh development. However,
the investigators were able to detect elevated FGFR2 copy number
in cfDNA of all these three responders, with good correlation
with the amplification level in archival tissue. Plasma screening in
an additional patient that showed reduction in FDG uptake in
day 15 PET CT scan, highlighted also high-level FGFR2amp. In
contrast, patients with sub-clonal or low-level FGFR2amp did
not present elevated levels of FGFR2 copy number in cfDNA.
Together, these results offer the opportunity to consider plasma
screening methods as a different but really interesting strategy to
identify high FGFR2amp patients, representing a potential feas-
ible assessment for selecting the best candidates.
Finally, the oncogenic potential of certain FGFR2 isoforms has
been described [52]. As example, the FGFR2-C3 transforming
isoform codifies for an aberrant FGFR, leading to a delayed in-
ternalization and subsequent constitutively FRS2-dependent

 activated signalling [53]. Interestingly, it seems that only GC with
high FGFR2amp express this truncated FGFR2-C3 isoform, al-
though not in a uniform level [51]. Published data have recently
suggested that FGFR amplified tumours may also require the co-
expression of higher FGF ligand levels for responding to
FGFRinh, as the co-amplification of FGFR/FGF genes has shown
to confer more sensitivity to FGFR inhibition in cell lines [54].
Therefore, both the detection of specific FGFR2 isoforms or FGF
ligand over-expression may also represent novel and enriching
predictive biomarkers. Figure 2 illustrates several predictive bio-
markers proposed for better delineating the FGFRamp GC popu-
lation that may benefit from an FGFRinh.
One clear limitation seen in these early studies testing
AZD4547 was the small n of patients included. Noteworthy, it has
to be considered that these studies mainly enrolled a Western
population, where the prevalence of FGFR2amp is around 9%.
Taking into account the geographical differences in GC, one
might question whether the prevalence of highly FGFR2amp pa-
tients in Asian countries follows the same prevalence as in
Western countries (5% highly FGFR2amp among 9% of total
FGFR2amp). The SHINE study may have failed to demonstrate
its primary endpoint due to the low pre-established threshold for
considering FGFR2amp patients (ratio >2.0), whilst the POC
study raised the cut off ratio above 2.2. These observations high-
light the importance of contextualizing the observed findings ac-
cording to each population included and under which criteria.
The biomarker analysis and efficacy results of the phase 1 trial in
Japanese patients (NCT01213160) will help in clarifying whether
this pathway plays a different role in Asian populations that it is
worth to explore.
Conclusions
The successful development of new targeted therapies for GC will
rely on our capacity of design and implement new personalized
strategies. To date, several large randomised phase 3 trials testing
targeted agents in first-line GC have resulted negative: the LOGIC
study in HER2-positive GC [55], the EXPAND and REAL-3 stud-
ies evaluating the epidermal growth factor receptor blockade [56,
57], the RILOMET-1 and METGastric studies assessing the role
of MET inhibition [58–60] or the AVAGAST study that con-
sidered the anti-angiogenic strategy [61].

Figure 2. Illustration of potential predictive biomarkers to FGFR/FGF inhibition in FGFR2amp GC. Detection of FGFR2 gene amplification has
been the mainstay for pre-screening FGFR2amp patients so far. Nevertheless, not all FGFR2amp patients seem to translate neither into high
FGFR2 mRNA levels nor into high FGFR2 protein levels. This correlation may result crucial for predicting response to FGFRinh. On top that,
the expression of certain FGFR2-C3 isoforms that codify for constitutively activated FGFR proteins, could represent a potential predictive bio-
marker of FGFR inhibition. The detailed evaluation of FGFR2amp heterogeneity when analysing a tissue sample by mapping FISH may shed
more light regarding the clonal amplification of FGFR2 within the tumour. The assessment of FGFR2 copy number variation (CNV) in circulat-
ing tumour DNA (ctDNA) and the identification of FGF ligand over-expression may help in better selecting those patients more likely to
benefit from an FGFRinh.

 These disappointing results highlight the unmet medical need
that GC continues to represent, and how necessary is to optimize
the pre-screening strategies for better selecting small patient
populations [62]. Some of these studies had in common that pa-
tients were enrolled without a pre-specified molecular biomarker
to enrich the study population [56, 57, 61]. Other studies did pre-
screen patients for a specific molecular alteration, such as HER2
in the LOGIC study or MET in RILOMET-1/METGastric studies
[58, 60], but the molecular aberration selected or the assessment
method may not have been the optimal one for predicting re-
sponse to the corresponding drug-directed therapy. Unless the
researchers become aware of the need to identify reliable predict-
ive biomarkers, we risk facing many more discouraging negative
trials in the forthcoming years.
Rising evidence positions FGFR2 as an emerging druggable tar-
get in FGFR2amp GC patients. However, mild efficacy signs have
been seen across early studies testing FGFRinh in this subset popu-
lation. Figure 3 shows how the accurate evaluation of the data gen-
erated in initial trials testing AZD4547 has led to the discovery of
potential predictive biomarkers to the FGFR inhibition in GC pa-
tients. Careful interpretation of these results seems mandatory for
guiding the next steps of FGFRinh development in GC, maybe
leading behind the FGFR2 DNA-centred analysis in formalin-fixed
paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. Combined strategies assessing
clonal heterogeneity of high FGFR2amp by FISH plus FGFR2
mRNA/protein expression may optimize the identification of the
5% of GC patients more likely to respond. As happened 10 years
ago within the ToGA study, the selection of FGFR2amp may
mimic the dual strategy for HER2-positive selection, where the
current guidelines recommend a combination of IHC threshold/
FISH cut off for defining this positivity. Nevertheless, it has to be
considered that not all FGFR2amp may translate into mRNA/pro-
tein FGFR2 overexpression, as happens in other tumour subtypes.
As example, the analysis of FGFR1amp NSCLC samples demon-
strated that not all of them express mRNA FGFR1, and this mRNA
expression does not always correlate with the FGFR1 protein
expression levels [63]. To add even more complexity, some non-
amplified tumours can present high levels of FGFR protein expres-
sion which may rescue patients initially considered unresponsive
to FGFRinh therapy [64].
One of the main challenges in FGFR2amp patients will be how
to establish a cut off for defining high FGFR mRNA expressers,
specially taking into consideration that the FGFR/FGF pathway
also plays a key role in normal homeostasis processes of healthy

homogeneous distribution, high FGFR2 3mRNA and 4protein levels, 5FGFR2-C3 isoform expression and detection of 6FGFR2 CNV in ctDNA ac-
count as some of the potential predictive biomarkers to FGFRinh.

 tissues. Will we be able to define a universal threshold for all the
tumours or we will need to find a specific pathologic FGFR
mRNA level in GC? Scarce data are available regarding mRNA
pre-screening methods and their positivity values, although some
trials developing FGFRinh have already started to implement
them, showing promising improvement in patient selection [34].
On top of that, we will need to consider that GC is characterized
by a high incidence of intra-tumoural heterogeneity, which is al-
ready known to translate into a poorer correlation between gen-
omic results (assessed by FISH or NGS) and protein expression
levels [65]. Quantitative proteomic analysis of FGFR2 may repre-
sent a more accurate method for defining a cut off level of protein
expression to select best responders, as happens with HER2-
positive patients [66, 67].
Considering these drawbacks, the assessment of FGFR2 CNA
in plasmatic samples arises as a very promising pre-screening op-
tion, especially for those patients with no archival tissue available
or for those in which the FFPE analysis results are inconclusive.
Furthermore, the evaluation as biomarkers of response of FGF
ligand over-expression or FGFR2-C3 isoform expression cer-
tainly warrants further investigation. The relevance of different
gene isoforms for predicting response to specific targeted agents
has been well described in the literature [68]. Recently, increased
p95HER2 levels, a truncated form of the HER2 receptor, have
shown to confer resistance to trastuzumab-directed therapy in
HER2-positive GC patients [69].
The future development of FGFRinh in FGFR2amp GC pa-
tients will rely on the capacity of identifying suitable predictive
biomarkers and to appropriately implement them early in the de-
sign of future clinical trials. As it happened before with ALK-
positive lung cancer patients, the feasibility of testing GC patients
for detecting low prevalence biomarkers emerges as one major
challenge. Of note, the PROFILE-1007 study needed to screen a
total of 4967 patients during two years for identifying only 347
ALK-positive cases [70]. Crizotinib resulted one of the most suc-
cessful personalized strategies developed for a molecularly se-
lected population ever. With this, we learnt that ambitious trial
designs are possible based on a deeper knowledge of the key mo-
lecular target and, if required, with the participation of multiple
institutions able to easily enroll patients with an uncommon can-
cer. GC may be a common cancer, but highly FGFR2amp GC not,
and identifying this subset of patients will be essential for enroll-
ing them in a biologically-driven trial with FGFRinh. Accurate
and validated companion diagnostics that allow screening of
multiple molecular aberrations in a timely manner will play a cru-
cial role in the success of these FGFRinh and other targeted drugs,
widening the horizon of treatments for GC patients.
