Abstract
Although neuronal activity can be modulated using a variety of techniques, there are currently few 
methods for controlling neuronal connectivity. We introduce a tool (GFE3) that mediates the fast, 
specific and reversible elimination of inhibitory synaptic inputs onto genetically determined 
neurons. GFE3 is a fusion between an E3 ligase, which mediates the ubiquitination and rapid 
degradation of proteins, and a recombinant, antibody-like protein (FingR) that binds to Gephyrin. 
Expression of GFE3 leads to a strong and specific reduction of Gephyrin in culture or in vivo and 
to a substantial decrease in phasic inhibition onto cells that express GFE3. By temporarily 
expressing GFE3 we showed that inhibitory synapses regrow following ablation. Thus, we have 
created a simple, reversible method for modulating inhibitory synaptic input onto genetically 
determined cells.
Editorial summary
When studying neural circuitry, the ablation of synapses may be an alternative to optogenetic 
manipulation of neurons. Arnold et al. report a genetically encoded tool called GFE3 that 
eliminates inhibitory inputs into neurons expressing GFE3.

 We sought to create a method for eliminating inhibitory inputs onto neurons by ablating 
Gephyrin, a postsynaptic protein that clusters GABAA and Glycine receptors1–3. Traditional 
methods for eliminating protein expression, such as gene deletion4 or siRNA5, work by 
means of cutting off protein supply, and thus become effective only as the protein degrades, 
which can take a week or longer6,7. Furthermore, they are not easily reversible. Therefore, 
our approach uses an E3 Ligase enzyme, which marks proteins for degradation by mediating 
the covalent attachment of ubiquitin polypeptides to lysine residues, causing the marked 
proteins to be transported to the proteasome and degraded8. E3 ligases can be engineered to 
have arbitrary specificity by fusing their ubiquitin transferase domains with proteins that 
bind to specific targets. For instance, a fusion of an E3 ligase with a GFP nanobody degrades 
exogenously expressed GFP in vivo9. However, endogenous proteins have been targeted 
with genetically encoded molecules in few examples only10.
We have generated a protein, GFE3, that mediates the fast and specific degradation of 
Gephyrin, eliminating the inhibitory synaptic inputs to the neurons in which it is expressed. 
Gephyrin degradation is complete within 5 hours of inducing GFE3 expression, and 
cessation of GFE3 expression results in inhibitory synapses reappearing within 48 hours. 
Thus, GFE3 can specifically and reversibly alter synaptic connectivity.
Results
GFE3 mediates degradation of Gephyrin
We generated GFE3 by fusing GFP-GPHN.FingR, an antibody-like protein based on the 
10FNIII domain of fibronectin that binds Gephyrin with high affinity11, with the RING 
domain of XIAP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase12 (Supplementary Fig. 1). To test whether GFE3 can 
mediate the elimination of endogenous Gephyrin, we compared the expression of synaptic 
proteins from cultures of cortical neurons expressing GFE3 and cultures expressing control 
constructs. Neurons that expressed either GPHN.FingR only or a fusion of the RING domain 
with a FingR containing random residues within its target binding domains (RandE3) 
displayed both Gephyrin and PSD-95 puncta, whereas neurons expressing GFE3 displayed 
PSD-95 puncta, but no Gephyrin puncta (Fig. 1a–c, Supplementary Fig. 1).
To investigate GFE3’s mode of action, we co-expressed GFE3, GPHN.FingR or RandE3 in 
COS-7 cells with Gephyrin-GFP. In the course of 24 hours, GFE3 reduced exogenous 
Gephyrin-GFP by ~ 80% compared to the controls. This reduction was dependent on 
proteasome function as shown by treatment with Lactacystin (clasto-Lactacystin-[beta]-
lactone), a highly specific and irreversible proteasome inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. 1). We 
also co-expressed Gephyrin-GFP in COS-7 cells with HA-Ubiquitin and either GFE3, 
GPHN.FingR or RandE3 in the presence of Lactacystin and immunoprecipitated with an 
anti-Gephyrin antibody. Anti-HA staining of the precipitates revealed a prominent high 
molecular weight band in the GFE3 lane that likely corresponds to poly-ubiquitinated 
Gephyrin (Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, our results are consistent with GFE3 causing poly-
ubiquitination of Gephyrin followed by degradation in the proteasome.
To quantify the effect of expressing GFE3 in neurons, we compared uninfected (control) 
neuronal cultures to cultures infected with a lentivirus encoding either GFE3, GPHN.FingR

 or RandE3. Lentiviral infection led to efficient expression of GFE3 and a sharp reduction of 
endogenous Gephyrin, whereas infection with RandE3 or GPHN.FingR, while equally 
efficient, did not affect Gephyrin expression (Supplementary Fig. 2). GFE3 expressing 
cultures expressed 80% less Gephyrin compared with neurons expressing GPHN.FingR 
(Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 3). Despite this effect on Gephyrin expression, GFE3 had a 
negligible effect on expression levels of the GABAA receptor, PSD-95, GluA1, GluN2B, or 
the Gephyrin interactors Collybistin II13 and GABARAP14 (Fig. 1d). Indeed, expression 
levels of these proteins are not significantly different in cells expressing GFE3 versus the 
three types of control cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, expression of GFE3 leads to the 
efficient, specific reduction of endogenous Gephyrin levels.
Because Gephyrin clusters GABAA receptors, we examined the effect of GFE3 on the 
receptors’ distribution. In control cells GABAA receptors were clustered and colocalized 
with Gephyrin, whereas in neurons transfected with GFE3 GABAA receptors were diffusely 
distributed and Gephyrin staining was not visible (Fig. 1e, f; Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, 
reducing endogenous Gephyrin by expressing GFE3 appears to release GABAA receptors 
from postsynaptic clusters, allowing them to distribute through the dendrites, but does not 
substantially reduce their expression, consistent with results obtained with siRNA against 
Gephyrin15. Furthermore, although expression of GFE3 causes a large change in Gephyrin 
expression levels, its expression is not associated with changes in either cell viability or 
overall proteasome activity (Supplementary Fig. 5).
GFE3 expression eliminates phasic inhibition
To examine the functional consequences of GFE3 expression, we transfected cultured 
hippocampal neurons with GFE3, GFP (control) or RandE3. We recorded from neurons with 
access resistance below 30 MΩ that varied by 20% or less using whole cell patch clamp. 
GFE3-expressing cells exhibited miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) with a 
roughly 65% decrease in the frequency and 30% reduction in amplitude when compared to 
control cells or to cells expressing RandE3 (Fig. 2a–d). In contrast, miniature EPSCs 
recorded under similar conditions in cells expressing GFE3 showed no significant difference 
in either frequency or amplitude when compared with control cells (P > 0.75, Mann 
Whitney; Supplementary Fig. 6). To test whether functional GABAA receptors are still 
present on the neuronal membrane in cells expressing GFE3, we applied a high 
concentration of GABA (1 mM) to the bath. Under these conditions the amplitude of evoked 
currents was not significantly different between cells expressing GFE3 and controls (P > 0.5, 
Mann-Whitney; Fig. 2e, f). This suggests that unclustered GABAA receptors are on the cell 
surface and remain functional. Furthermore, noise analysis of these data is consistent with 
the kinetics of GABAA receptors being similar in the two conditions (Supplementary Fig. 7).
To test the efficiency of GFE3 in abolishing GABAergic synaptic transmission in the intact 
brain, we virally infected indirect spiny projection neurons (iSPNs) to induce GFE3 or 
GPHN.FingR expression in a cre-dependent manner in the dorsal striatum of Adora2A-cre 
mice, while simultaneously expressing Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) in non-cre-expressing 
striatal cells (Fig. 3a). This approach resulted in light-evoked synaptic GABAergic 
transmission onto iSPNs, with GABA being released presumably mostly from direct SPNs,

 with some contribution from GABAergic interneurons16. A single light pulse reliably 
evoked GABAA receptor mediated synaptic currents under control conditions where we 
expressed GPHN.FingR, but currents were abolished in iSPNs expressing GFE3 (Fig. 3b). 
We also examined spontaneous IPSCs, and found a significant reduction in both frequency 
(P = 0.0008, Mann-Whitney) and amplitude (P < 0.03, Mann-Whitney), compared to control 
conditions (Fig. 3c). This reduction in spontaneous synaptic activity was selective for 
GABAergic transmission, as spontaneous excitatory inputs were unchanged (Fig. 3c). Thus, 
expression of GFE3 specifically eliminates functional GABAergic synapses, without 
affecting glutamatergic synapses. In contrast, the amplitude of tonic GABA currents17–19 
showed a tendency towards reduction, but this change did not rise to the level of significance 
(Fig. 3d, e). These results indicate that while there might possibly be a partial reduction in 
total (synaptic and extra-synaptic) GABAA receptor expression at the cell surface, 
elimination of GABAA receptors from the synapse by GFE3 is not due to a general 
elimination of GABAA receptors from the cell, consistent with our results in dissociated 
cultures (Figs. 1e, f; 2e, f). Thus, our results are consistent with GFE3 specifically 
eliminating the phasic inhibitory input onto neurons in the intact brain.
GFE3 in zebrafish spinal neurons causes motor defects
To further test the efficacy of GFE3 in vivo, we injected zebrafish zygotes with a plasmid 
containing GFE3-GFP driven by the mnx1 enhancer, which restricts expression to spinal 
cord neurons20. Expression of GFE3-GFP was both efficient and specific as indicated by 
numerous labeled cells along the midline in the spinal cord 2 days post-injection (Fig. 4a). In 
fish expressing RandE3-GFP, GFP is visible within the cell bodies of spinal cord neurons, 
while at the outer edge of these cell bodies there is a ring of Gephyrin staining (Fig. 4b). In 
contrast, Gephyrin staining is sharply reduced in the cell bodies of spinal cord neurons 
expressing GFE3-GFP (Fig. 4c). Discontinuous staining on the edge of the GFP staining 
likely arises from unlabeled neighboring cells. Furthermore, the average level of Gephyrin 
staining surrounding the cell bodies of cells expressing GFE3-GFP was significantly lower 
than that of cells expressing RandE3-GFP alone (P < 0.008, Mann-Whitney; Fig. 4d).
A major role of inhibitory neurons in the zebrafish spinal cord is to prevent co-contractions 
of opposing muscles by inhibiting contralateral motoneurons21. Accordingly, zebrafish 
expressing mutant Glycine receptors in the spinal cord that fail to cluster at inhibitory 
synapses exhibit co-contraction of opposing muscles within the tail22,23. Zebrafish 
expressing GFE3-GFP (Supplementary Videos 1, 2) exhibited a lack of coordination when 
compared to zebrafish expressing RandE3-GFP (Supplementary Videos 3, 4), which would 
be expected if the lack of Gephyrin caused co-contraction of opposing muscles. To quantify 
these effects we took advantage of a peculiarity of the stereotyped tail flick behavior24,25. 
Fish expressing RandE3-GFP bend their tails in a tight circle so that the tip of the tail 
touches the base of the tail (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 8), where it connects with the 
abdomen of the fish. In contrast, fish that express GFE3-GFP do not touch the bases of their 
tails with the tips (Fig. 4f, Supplementary Fig. 8). Indeed, the minimum distance between 
the base and the tip of the tail during 5 tail flicks in zebrafish expressing GFE3-GFP was 
more than twice that of the same distance measured in zebrafish expressing RandE3-GFP 
(Fig. 4g). These results are consistent with expression of GFE3 causing the efficient ablation

 of Gephyrin in vivo, resulting in the loss of phasic inhibition within spinal cord neurons in 
zebrafish.
GFE3-mediated loss of Gephyrin is reversible
An advantage of the GFE3 approach is that Gephyrin expression is modified at the level of 
protein degradation, and thus the level of Gephyrin is expected to respond quickly to the 
expression or elimination of GFE3. To test this hypothesis, we expressed GPHN.FingR-GFP 
along with doxycycline(dox)-dependent GFE3-TagRFP in cortical neurons in culture and 
incubated for 4–7 days without dox, labeling inhibitory synapses with GPHN.FingR-GFP. 
We then induced expression of GFE3-TagRFP using dox (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 9), 
and found efficient elimination of Gephyrin in less than 5 hours as indicated by the absence 
of GPHN.FingR-GFP labeling (Fig 5a, b). Fixing the same cells and immunostaining for 
endogenous Gephyrin (green) and GFE3-TagRFP (red) confirmed that endogenous Gephyrin 
had been eliminated (Fig. 5c). In contrast, transfection of siRNA led to an 80% reduction in 
the number of Gephyrin puncta after 5 days in dissociated hippocampal cultures26.
To demonstrate reversible elimination of Gephyrin expression, we added dox to neurons 
transfected with GPHN.FingR-GFP and dox-dependent GFE3-TagRFP for 24 hours, and 
then removed dox and waited 48 hours to determine whether the Gephyrin puncta would 
return (Supplementary Fig. 9). As in the previous experiment, Gephyrin puncta labeled with 
GPHN.FingR-GFP disappeared following 24 hours of dox-induced GFE3-TagRFP 
expression (Fig. 5d, e; Supplementary Fig. 9). Removal of dox for 48 hours resulted in a 
reappearance of Gephyrin puncta (Fig. 5f), many in places that are close to their original 
locations (Fig. 5g). Gephyrin immunostaining at 48 hours after removal of Dox showed that 
newly formed Gephyrin puncta co-localized with staining for presynaptic GAD-65 (Fig. 5h), 
suggesting that the recovered Gephyrin puncta have corresponding presynaptic sites, and 
thus are likely part of reconstituted synapses. Finally, quantitation of GPHN.FingR-GFP 
shows that following recovery total FingR staining in puncta is present at levels that are 
comparable to initial levels (Fig. 5i). Thus, by controlling the expression of GFE3 it is 
possible to induce the reversible ablation of Gephyrin.
Discussion
FingRs can target fluorescent proteins to endogenous target proteins, allowing the targets 
and the macromolecular structures where they reside to be visualized in vivo11,27. Here we 
show that an E3 ligase can also be targeted specifically using a FingR, causing expression of 
its target protein to be quickly and reversibly eliminated. Although this is not the first 
method developed for direct elimination of protein expression, it differs in important 
respects from previously described methods. Many such methods are specific to 
exogenously expressed proteins9,28, or are not genetically encoded29. Furthermore, FingRs 
bind to their targets without affecting target function or expression11, which means that 
protein elimination is entirely due to increased degradation through the E3 ligase and the 
Ubiquitin proteasome system. This is distinct from scFv-based proteins that reduce 
Gephyrin expression through an unknown mechanism, with unknown off-target effects30. In 
addition, because the Gephyrin FingR was specifically engineered to bind Gephyrin with

 very high affinity and specificity, the fidelity with which it degrades its target is likely to be 
much higher than that of a system that depends on naturally occurring protein-protein 
interactions, such as those involving PDZ domains, which have relatively low affinity and 
specificity31,32. Furthermore, positively charged cell-permeant peptides such as Tat, upon 
which systems mediating degradation with peptides rely, are inefficient, unstable, and induce 
cytotoxicity33.
E3 ligases can be fused to FingRs targeted against other proteins, suggesting that our 
approach could be generalizable for reversibly ablating a wide range of endogenous targets. 
In addition, because of its modular nature, we envision that GFE3 function could be 
engineered to rely on light dependent association of the two domains, making the complex 
active in response to light.
Modulating the excitability of neurons using optogenetics has revealed the 
electrophysiological properties of specific neuronal cell types and their roles in circuits and 
functional networks, which was not possible with previous pharmacological approaches. 
Like optogenetic proteins, GFE3 can be expressed in specific cell types. However, it acts at a 
qualitatively different level than optogenetics - modifying endogenous synaptic connectivity 
rather than directly inducing the opening of exogenous ion channels or the activation of 
pumps34. GFE3 also differs from AS-PaRac-1, which can inducibly reduce the strength of 
excitatory synapses, in that GFE3 eliminates Gephyrin, a component of the synapse, 
whereas AS-PaRac1 causes changes in the actin cytoskeleton supporting dendritic spines by 
modulating function of the G protein Rac135.
By targeting expression of GFE3 to excitatory cells it should increase excitability within a 
specific brain region, whereas expressing it in inhibitory cells should decrease excitability. 
Thus, it should be possible to probe the effects of systematically modulating the excitability 
of specific regions of the brain, both in wild-type animals and in disease models in a way 
that does not directly interfere with the firing patterns of cells.
In conclusion, GFE3 provides a fast, specific and reversible method for modulating 
inhibition onto defined cells. Furthermore, it provides a framework for generating a diverse 
array of genetically encoded modulators of expression and function that act specifically on 
virtually any target protein.

cDNA Constructs
The Gephyrin (GFE3) and Random (RandE3) ablating FingRs were constructed by fusing a 
DNA sequence encoding three consecutive HA-tags followed by the amino acids 440–496 of 
the RING domain of rat XIAP 3’ to the Gephyrin FingR gene11 or to the Random FingR 
gene FN0436 (Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, the gene for EGFP or TagRFP (Evrogen, 
cat. # FP141) was linked 3’ to a DNA spacer encoding the amino acid sequence GGGS 
repeated four times, which was then fused 5’ to the Gephyrin FingR to allow for direct 
visualization of the GFE3 in living cells. Expression constructs were made by ligating these 
genes into the pCAG, pFUW or pAAV37 expression vector. The construction of

 transcriptionally controlled Gephyrin.FingR-GFP-CCR5ZFL-KRAB(A) (Addgene, cat. # 
46296) and Gephyrin-GFP were described previously11. Note that in COS-7 cell 
experiments a non-transcriptionally controlled version of GPHN.FingR was used, but 
transcriptionally controlled GPHN.FingR was used in all other contexts. GHA-tagged 
Human Ubiquitin inserted into the constitutive mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 
(Addgene plasmid # 18712)38. Plasmids for expression of RandE3 or GFE3 in zebrafish 
were created by ligating the assembled gene (RandE3 or GFE3) into the modified expression 
vector pMT(3mnx1), which contains a triplicated enhancer element from the mnx1 gene 
upstream of the MCS that drives expression of the ablating FingR in spinal cord neurons20. 
A vector to mediate inducible expression of GFE3 (GFE3-TagRFPind) was generated by 
subcloning tagRFP-4(GGGS)-GFE3 into the pTRE-3G vector (Tet-On 3G, Clontech, cat. # 
631337). GFE3, RandE3, or GPHN.FingR was inserted into the MCS of the pFUW vector 
for production of lentivirus at the USC School of Pharmacy Lentiviral Laboratory. Similarly, 
GFE3 or GPHN.FingR was subcloned into the ‘cre-on’ pAAV-EF1a-DIO vector for 
production of AAV at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Vector Core. The 
sequences for all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.
Expression of Gephyrin Ablating FingRs in Cells
Constitutive expression of GPHN.FingR, GFE3 or RandE3 in mammalian cells was 
achieved through CalPhos (Clontech, cat. # 631312) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, cat. # 11668019) transfection, lentiviral transduction or adeno-associated virus 
(AAV) transduction of the construct into cells. Inducible expression of GFE3 was achieved 
by CalPhos-mediated co-transfection of GFE3-TagRFPind with the doxycycline-dependent 
Tet-On expression vector pCMV-Tet-3G (Tet-On 3G, Clontech, cat. # 631337) into cells. In 
experiments where the transcriptionally controlled Gephyrin FingR was co-expressed with 
doxycycline-induced GFE3, 2 µg of Gephyrin.FingR-GFP-CCR5ZFL-KRAB(A) was co-
transfected with 1 µg each of GFE3-TagRFPind and pCMV-Tet-3G into cells. 1 µg of 
doxycycline (EMD Millipore, cat. # 631311) in DMSO was added per mL of medium to 
cells to activate the Tet-On 3G expression system, and was removed by washing the cells six 
times with conditioned medium. Expression time of constructs ranged from 5 hours to 10 
days, as specified. For lentiviral infection 4 infectious units (IFU) of lentivirus at a titer of 
3.0×107 IFU/mL was used per cell by adding concentrated virus to the medium for 16 to 24 
hours. Transfection or transduction of cells was performed according to the manufacturer’s 
suggested protocol. Experimental protocols were conducted according to the US National 
Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research and were approved by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Southern California, the Animal Care 
Committee at Laval University and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at 
Harvard Medical School.
Ubiquitination and Proteasome Dependency
COS-7 cells (ATCC, cat. # CRL-1651) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s 
medium (ATCC, cat. # 30-2002) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 to a 
confluency of 80% on a 100 × 20 mm tissue culture dish before being co-transfected with 
constructs constitutively expressing the RandE3, GFE3 or the Gephyrin ablating FingR 
control along with Gephyrin-GFP and HA-Ubiquitin. 24 hours after transfection, cells were

 lysed in 1 mL of lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% NP40, 
0.12 mg/mL PMSF, 2 µg/mL Leupeptin, 1 µg/mL Aprotinin, 10 mM NaF, 1 µg/mL 
Pepstatin). Proteasome activity in cells was arrested by adding the highly specific and 
irreversible inhibitor clasto-Lactacystin-[beta]-lactone (10 µM, VWR, cat. # 80052-808) in 
DMSO to the culture medium. To examine Gephyrin ubiquitination in cells, 500 µl of lysate 
was pre-cleared with agarose beads for 2 hours at 4°C and then incubated overnight at 4°C 
with a rabbit anti-Gephyrin antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, cat. # A304-245A) diluted 1:100. 
The next day, 50 µl of protein A/G agarose beads (Pierce, cat. # 20421) were added to the 
lysate. The beads were then nutated at 4°C for 8 hours to immunoprecipitate (IP) Gephyrin, 
washed six times in wash buffer (as lysis buffer, except with 0.1% NP40) and finally boiled 
for 5 minutes in Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 10% 
Glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Cell lysate and eluate from the 
Gephyrin IP were run on pre-cast Any kD SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad, cat. # 4569033) and 
transferred to a low fluorescence PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, cat. # 1620264). The blots 
were then probed with a mouse anti-Gephyrin antibody (Synaptic Systems, cat. # 147 111), 
1:1000, a mouse anti-beta-tubulin antibody (Sigma, cat. # T4026), 1:5000, or a mouse anti-
HA antibody (Covance/BioLegend, cat. # 901513), 1:500. Secondary antibody used was 
goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 750 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. # A-21037), 1:1000. Blots 
were imaged with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Steady-
state protein levels were determined using ImageJ software (US National Institute of 
Health). Prior to analyses of data, Gephyrin-GFP levels were normalized to beta-tubulin 
levels. Data are represented as mean ± SEM and were compared using the non-parametric 
Kruskal-Wallis test. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant. The supplier (ATCC) 
tested the cells for mycoplasma and confirmed their species of origin by COI assay.
Lentiviral Transduction Efficiency
Efficiency of lentiviral transduction with GFE3, RandE3 or GPHN.FingR was assessed by 
counting the number of GFP positive and negative cells in five 133.3 µm2 images taken from 
infected Delta T dishes. In brief, live cell morphology and GFP expression were imaged and 
analyzed first with brightfield illumination and FITC fluorescence. Cells were then fixed and 
stained for GFP and Gephyrin, and mounted in Fluoromount-G with DAPI (Electron 
Microscopy Sciences, cat. # 17984-24). A GFP positive cell was identified by colocalization 
of GFP with DAPI in the cell body, whereas a GFP negative cell had no colocalization of 
DAPI with GFP. Image analyses were done blinded with ImageJ software. Data are 
represented as mean ± SEM and were subjected to a Kruskal-Wallis test. A P value < 0.05 
was considered significant.
Quantitation of knockdown of synaptic protein levels following expression of GFE3
Dissociated rat cortical neurons seeded at a density of 7.5 × 105 on 100 × 20 mm tissue 
culture dishes were transduced with 3.0 × 106 IFUs of lentivirus with the RandE3, GFE3 or 
GPHN.FingR. After 16 hours of expression, cells were lysed in 1 mL of lysis buffer with 1% 
Triton X-100. Samples were then run on Any kD SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF 
membrane. The blots were probed with a mouse anti-Gephyrin antibody, 1:1000, a rabbit 
anti-GABAA receptor alpha1 antibody (EMD Millipore, cat. # 06-868), 1:1000, a mouse 
anti-PSD-95 antibody (NeuroMab, cat. # 75-028), 1:1000, a mouse anti-GluA1 antibody

independent experiments were obtained using ImageJ software. This data was normalized to 
beta-tubulin levels and subjected to a Kruskal-Wallis test. All data are expressed as mean ± 
SEM. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Preparation of Cortical Neurons
Cortices from E17 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos were dissected in 0.1 mM HEPES (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, cat. # 15630-080) supplemented Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. # 14025076), HEPES-HBSS. The dissected cortices were 
trypsinized in 0.25 % trypsin, 0.1 mM HEPES-HBSS for 15 min at 37°C; the tissue was then 
washed 3 times in fresh HEPES-HBSS. Afterwards, the cortices were triturated to dissociate 
the cells. The neurons were then plated in poly-D-lysine and laminin pre-treated 22 × 22 mm 
coverslips (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. # 12-541B) in 6 well plates (VWR International, 
cat. # 29442-036) at a density of 5.0×104, 0.17 mm Delta T culture dishes (Bioptechs, cat. # 
04200417C) at a density of 3.5×104, 100 × 20 mm tissue culture dishes (VWR, cat. # 
25382-166) at a density of 7.5×105, and 96 well plates (Sigma, cat. # CLS3610) at a density 
of 2.5×103 cells per well in supplemented Neurobasal medium (NBM, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, cat. # 21103-049). The NBM was supplemented with 10 mL/L Glutamax 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. # 35050-061), 1 mg/L gentamicin solution (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, cat. # 15750-078), 20 mL/L B-27 supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. # 
17504-044), and 50 mL/L fetal bovine serum (Biowest, cat. # S162H). Four hours after the 
neurons were plated, the medium was diluted 1:3 with serum-free supplemented NBM. 
After 7 days in vitro, the medium in the wells was diluted 1:2 with fresh supplemented 
NBM. Neurons were cultured 12–16 days in vitro (DIV) before transfection with CalPhos or 
16–20 DIV prior to transduction with lentivirus.
Immunocytochemistry of Cortical Neurons
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat. # 15714) 
for 5 minutes, and then subjected to three 5 minute washes with PBS. Prior to staining with 
primary antibody, cells were blocked with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 5% 
normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 minutes. After blocking, primary 
antibody was diluted in blocking solution and added to cells for 1 hour. This was followed 
by three 5 minute washes of cells in PBS. Secondary antibody was diluted in blocking 
solution and added to cells for 30 minutes in the dark. After staining, cells were washed for 
5 minutes three times with PBS and then mounted onto 75 × 25 mm glass microscope slides 
(VWR, cat. # 48300-025) in Fluoromount-G (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat. # 
17984-25) or Fluoromount-G with DAPI. All steps were performed at room temperature. 
Primary antibody concentrations were as follows: chicken anti-GFP (Aves, cat. # 
GFP-1020), 1:4000, mouse anti-Gephyrin (Synaptic Systems, cat. # 147 008), 1:300, rabbit

GABAA receptor alpha1 (EMD Millipore, cat. # 06-868), 1:1000. Secondary antibodies used 
were: goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594, goat anti-rabbit 
Alexa Fluor 594, goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647, goat anti-mouse IgG2a Alexa Fluor 594, 
goat anti-mouse IgG3 Alexa Fluor 594, goat anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa Fluor 594 and goat 
anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. # A-11039, A-11005, 
R-37117, A-27040, A-21135, A-21155, A-21125, A-21240), all at dilutions of 1:1000.
Image Capture and Analysis of Cortical Neurons
Imaging of fixed, immunostained cells was done on a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal 
microscope. Each cell was imaged as a single optical section with either an ×20 objective at 
1.0× zoom or an ×40 objective at 2.0× zoom, unless otherwise noted. Stained levels of 
Gephyrin, PSD95 and GABAAR were determined by measuring mean pixel intensity on 
dendrites from neurons with similar morphology that expressed GFE3, RandE3 or 
GPHN.FingR. Image analyses were performed blinded with ImageJ software. Data are 
represented as mean ± SEM and were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney 
test. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant. Living cells on Delta T culture dishes were 
imaged in HBSS buffer, supplemented with 10mM HEPES and pre-warmed to 37°C, with 
an ×20 air objective or ×60 water objective at 1.0× zoom on an Olympus X81 inverted 
microscope equipped with the Delta T system (Bioptechs, cat. # 0420-4), an EM-CCD 
digital camera (Hamamatsu, cat. # C9100-02), DAPI, GFP/mCherry and Cy5.5 filter cubes 
(Chroma Technology, cat. # 49000, cat. # 59022 and # SP105), an MS-2000 XYZ automated 
stage (Applied Scientific Instrumentation), an X-cite exacte mercury lamp (Excelitas 
Technologies) and Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). Imaging of GFP and TagRFP 
was done at 25% intensity with a 400 ms exposure to minimize bleaching and phototoxicity 
affects. Intensity values of puncta labeled by transcriptionally controlled GPHN.FingR-GFP 
in images taken at different time points were determined with ImageJ software. All analyses 
of cells were performed blinded. Only neurons with healthy morphology were selected for 
quantification, and none of the images used contained saturated pixels in the axon or 
dendrites of cells. Data are represented as mean pixel intensities ± SEM and were compared 
using the Mann-Whitney test. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Cell Viability, Cytotoxicity, ATP Levels and Proteasome Activity
2.5 × 103 rat cortical neurons/well in 96 well white-walled plates were transduced with 
9×103 IFUs of lentivirus with GFE3, RandE3 or GPHN.FingR for 16 hours. Cell viability 
and cytotoxicity were assessed using the MultiTox-Glo Multiplex Cytotoxicity Assay kit 
(Promega, cat. # G9270) that measures: 1) fluorescence generated in living cells from 
selective uptake of a protease substrate conjugated to a fluorophore (AFC) that fluoresces on 
proteolytic cleavage, and 2) light produced by Luciferase from a substrate (aminoluciferin) 
that is activated by proteases released into the medium from dead cells. The ATP levels of 
neurons were measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit 
(Promega, cat. # G7570), which uses ATP released from lysed cells and Luciferase to 
generate light. As a positive control for cell viability and cytotoxicity assays, the 
mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP, Sigma, cat. # N5636) was applied to cells

 at a final concentration of 15 mM for 48 hours39. Proteasome activity in transduced cells 
was determined using the Proteasome-Glo 3-Substrate Cell-Based Assay kit (Promega, cat. 
#G1180), which uses proteasome caspase-, trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activity to 
produce light via aminoluciferin-based substrates and Luciferase. As a positive control for 
proteasome activity, the highly specific proteasome inhibitor clasto-Lactacystin-[beta]-
lactone was added to the medium of cells at a final concentration of 10 µM for 3 hours 
before obtaining measurements. All assays were performed according to the instructions 
provided by the manufacturer. Fluorometric and luminometric measurements were taken 
with a Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) microplate reader. 24 wells were 
measured per condition. Data are represented as measurements of transduced (or positive 
control) cells divided by the mean of non-transduced (or vehicle control) cells ± SEM and 
were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Preparation and Transfection of Hippocampal Neurons
Dissociated hippocampal neurons were prepared as described previously40. Briefly, 
dissected hippocampi from P1–P3 Sprague Dawley rats of both sexes were dissociated 
enzymatically (papain, 12 U/mL; Worthington) and mechanically (trituration with a Pasteur 
pipette). After dissociation, the cells were washed, centrifuged and plated on poly-D-lysine-
coated Aclar (12 mm) coverslips at a density of 350–450 cells/mm2. Growth medium 
consisted of NBM and B27 (50:1), supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (50 U/mL; 50 
µg/mL) and 0.5 mM Glutamax. Fetal bovine serum (2%, Hyclone, GE Healthcare, cat. # 
SH30088.02) was added at the time of plating. After 5 days, half the medium was changed 
to a medium without serum, but with Ara-C added (5 µM; Sigma-Aldrich; cat. # C1768) to 
limit proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Twice a week, half of the growth medium was 
replaced with serum and Ara-C free medium. Neurons were transfected at 11–13 DIV using 
Lipofectamine 2000, as previously described40. To avoid synaptic scaling after gephyrin 
ablation, cultures were treated with TTX (1 µM) 24 h before recording. By that time, 
expression of FingR constructs was observed
Electrophysiology of Hippocampal Neurons
Coverslips containing transfected neurons were transferred to a recording chamber and 
perfused with a recording solution which consisted of HBSS containing: 1.2 mM CaCl2, and 
1.0 mM MgCl2,10 mM Hepes, 2.0 mM glucose, pH 7.3. The osmolarity of the solution was 
adjusted to 290 mOsm/kg. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were obtained with 
borosilicate glass pipettes (4–6 MΩ). For mIPSC recordings, pipettes were filled with an 
internal solution containing: 100 mM CsMeSO3, 20 mM CsCl, 2.5 MgCl2, 70 mM Hepes, 
0.6 mM Cs-EGTA, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.4 mM Tris-GTP, pH 7.3 and clamped at 0 mV in the 
presence of TTX (1 µM). Evoked GABA currents were recorded with an internal solution 
containing: 120 mM CsCl, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Hepes, 11 mM Cs-
EGTA, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 1 mM TEA, pH 7.3. After a stable baseline, a high concentration of 
GABA (1 mM) was added to the bath during 1 minute and then washed out. For mEPSC 
recordings pipettes were filled with an internal solution containing: 100 mM CsMeSO3, 20 
mM CsCl, 2.5 MgCl2, 70 mM Hepes, 0.6 mM Cs-EGTA, 4 mM Mg-ATP, 0.4 mM Tris-
GTP, pH 7.3. Miniature excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs and

 mIPSCS) were recorded at holding potentials of −70 mV and 0 mV, respectively, in the 
presence of TTX (1 µM).
All recordings were performed at room temperature. Signals were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz 
and digitized at 10 kHz using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, Digidata 1440 digitizer and 
pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). Comparisons of parameters for mIPSCs and 
mEPSCs were made using a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunn's multiple parameter 
comparison. Responses to GABA applications were analyzed using 2-tailed unpaired Mann-
Whitney test. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant. All data are expressed as mean ± 
SEM.
Noise analysis
To see if unclustering of GABAA receptors affects their kinetic properties, we performed 
stationary noise analysis of GABAA receptors activated by the exogenous application of 
GABA (1mM) as previously described41. Briefly, a region of 50 s after peak GABA 
activation was high pass filtered at 1 Hz and a power spectrum was derived. This spectrum 
was fitted with the sum of three Laurentzian functions of the form:
where L(f) is the spectral density at frequency f. Si is the power of the spectrum at f = 0 and 
fci is the cutoff frequency at which the spectral power is half. The corresponding time 
constants (τi) are derived by the relationship τi = 1/(2πfci)41.
Zebrafish Husbandry and Experimentation
Wild-type AB and AB/TL zebrafish (Danio rerio) were raised and nucleic acid injections 
were performed as described previously42. Embryos were maintained at 28°C for up to 5 
days post fertilization (dpf) in egg water (1.19 g NaCl, 0.377 g CaSO4·2H2O, 265 µL 
methylene blue, filled to 5 L with ddH2O). Within the 28°C incubator, the fish were exposed 
to a 13/11 hour day/night light cycle. At the zygote stage, zebrafish were left uninjected 
(control) or were injected with 45–70 pg of DNA, along with 35 pg of Tol2 Transposase43 
mRNA27 S to facilitate mosaic integration of the pMT(3mnx1) plasmid DNA into the 
zebrafish genome. Before behavior experiments (i.e. spontaneous tail flick), 17–22 hour post 
fertilization zebrafish embryos in egg water were carefully dechorionated with a pair of #5 
forceps (Fine Science Tools). 200 µL of egg water supplemented with 0.003% 1-phenyl 2-
thiourea (PTU, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. # P7629) – to inhibit pigment formation – was added to 
individual wells of a 96-well plate, and individual zebrafish were placed into each of the 
filled wells with a glass pipette. Gender could not be determined due to the age of the fish44. 
Zebrafish tail flicking behavior was recorded (40 frames per second) from below the well 
plate using a compact USB 3.0 CMOS camera (Cat #DCC1545M, Thorlabs). After tail flick 
imaging, zebrafish were kept overnight at 28°C within the 96-well plate. At 2 dpf, zebrafish 
injected with the spinal cord neuron expressing GFE construct were anesthetized with 
0.015–0.03% MS-222 (Argent Laboratories), embedded in 1–1.5% SeaPlaque agarose 
within a 30X Danieau’s solution (17.4 mM NaCl, 0.21 mM KCl, 0.12 mM MgSO4, 0.18

 mM Ca(NO3)2, 1.5 mM HEPES), and imaged using a Plan Apochromat ×20 objective on a 
commercial LSM 700 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG), as similarly described45. 
Mosaic-labeled GFP positive cells were visualized throughout the zebrafish spinal cord 
using the tiled confocal stack feature of the microscope. For immunostaining of zebrafish, 
1–2 dpf zebrafish were anesthetized in 0.03% MS-222 and were fixed in 2% Trichoroacetic 
acid for 3 hours at room temperature. After 5 washes in PBS pH 7.4 with 0.5% Triton X-100 
(PBT), fish were blocked overnight in blocking buffer (PBS pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum 
albumin, 1% DMSO, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% normal goat serum) at 4 °C on an orbital 
shaker. Mouse anti-Gephyrin antibody (Synaptic Systems, cat. # 147 111) was applied at a 
1:250 dilution in blocking buffer and the embryos were left at 4 °C on an orbital shaker for 
72–96 hours. After 5 washes in PBT, goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 antibody (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, cat. #A-11005) was applied at a 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer, and the 
sample was left on an orbital shaker at 4 °C for 14–18 hours. Following 5 washes in PBT, 
samples were washed in PBS pH 7.4. For clearing, samples were progressively dehydrated 
in glycerol, ultimately ending in a solution of 75% glycerol / 25% PBS pH 7.4. Samples 
were placed on #1.5 coverslips and were imaged with a commercial LSM 780 confocal 
microscope (Carl Zeiss AG) using an ×63 water objective. Analyses of Gephyrin levels in 
confocal images were performed blinded with ImageJ software. All data are expressed as 
mean ± SEM. Zebrafish were included in analysis that had at least 20 labeled motoneurons. 
No randomization was used.
Stereotaxic Intracranial Injections
To examine inhibitory synaptic inputs, a total of 1 µl AAV-DIO-GFE3-GFP (‘cre-on’) mixed 
at a 2:1 ratio with AAV-FAS-ChR2-mCherry (‘cre-off’37) was delivered by intracranial 
injection into the striatum of Adora2a-cre mice (GENSAT: B6.FVB(Cg)-
Tg(Adora2acre)KG139Gsat/Mmucd) (P18-P22) of both sexes maintained under deep 
isoflurane anesthesia. The non-ablating gephyrin intrabody (AAV-DIO-GPHN.FingR-
GFP11) was used as an internal control in the other hemisphere of each mouse. Note that 
AAV-EF1a-DIO-GFE3 and AAV-EF1a-DIO-GPHN.FingR are AAV serotype 9, AAV-EF1a-
FAS-ChR2-mCherry is serotype 8 and 3.8×1010 genome copies (GC) at a titer of 3.8×1013 
GC/mL were used. To test excitatory inputs, AAV-DIO-GFE3-GFP or AAV-DIO-
GPHN.FingR-GFP mixed with AAV-hSyn-cre at a 100:1 GC-ratio was injected into the 
striatum of age-matched wildtype mice of both sexes (C57Bl/6, Charles River). Injection 
coordinates were 0.7 mm anterior from Bregma, 1.8 mm lateral, and 2.45 mm below pia, 
and expression time was at 12–14 days.
Slice Preparation and Electrophysiology
Acute sagittal brain slices were prepared, and electrophysiological recordings obtained, as 
described before46, with the following variations: Spiny projection neurons of the indirect 
pathway were identified by GFP expression and their electrical properties, and synaptic 
currents were recorded using a high-chloride pipette solution containing (in mM) 125 CsCl, 
10 TEA-Cl, 0.1 EGTA (CsOH), 10 HEPES, 3.3 QX-314 (Cl-), 1.8 MgCl2, 4 Na2-ATP, 0.3 
Na-GTP, 8 Na2-phosphocreatine (pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH; 295 mOsm·kg−1). GABAA 
receptor-mediated currents were recorded as inward currents in voltage-clamp mode at Vhold 
= −70mV in the presence of the AMPA and NMDA-type glutamate receptor inhibitors

 NBQX and (R)-CPP (10 µm each). Excitatory currents were isolated by adding SR95331 
(10 µM) to the bath solution. Tonic GABAA receptor mediated currents were defined as the 
difference in holding current before and after bath application of SR95331 (10 µM). Pipette 
resistance was 2.5–3 MΩ, and all recordings were performed at 33–34°C. Errors due to the 
voltage drop across the series resistance (< 15 MΩ) were left uncompensated. ChR2 was 
activated by a single 1 ms pulse of light delivered by a 473 nm laser using full-field 
illumination through the objective (~3 mW·mm−2) at 30 s intervals. All pharmacological 
reagents were obtained from Tocris.
Data Acquisition and Analysis
Membrane currents were acquired as described previously46, and analyzed in Igor Pro 
(Wavemetrics). For display and analysis of optically evoked synaptic membrane currents, 10 
consecutive traces were averaged for each cell. Data are represented as mean ± SEM (bars) 
overlaid over individual data points (gray circles) and were compared using the non-
parametric Mann-Whitney test. P values are reported directly, and values smaller than 0.05 
were considered statistically significant.
Statistics
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Nonparametric tests were 
used throughout, as the data are not normally distributed. Data are represented as mean ± 
SEM. Statistical comparisons are between groups with similar variances.
