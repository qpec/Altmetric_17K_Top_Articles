BACKGROUND: Americans have a shorter life expectancy compared with 
residents of almost all other high-income countries. We aim to estimate 
the impact of lifestyle factors on premature mortality and life expectancy 
in the US population.
METHODS: Using data from the Nurses’ Health Study (1980–2014; 
n=78 
865) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986–2014, 
n=44 
354), we defined 5 low-risk lifestyle factors as never smoking, body 
mass index of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2, ≥30 min/d of moderate to vigorous 
physical activity, moderate alcohol intake, and a high diet quality score 
(upper 40%), and estimated hazard ratios for the association of total 
lifestyle score (0–5 scale) with mortality. We used data from the NHANES 
(National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys; 2013–2014) to 
estimate the distribution of the lifestyle score and the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database to derive the age-
specific death rates of Americans. We applied the life table method to 
estimate life expectancy by levels of the lifestyle score.
RESULTS: During up to 34 years of follow-up, we documented 42 
167 
deaths. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for mortality in adults 
with 5 compared with zero low-risk factors were 0.26 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.22–0.31) for all-cause mortality, 0.35 (95% CI, 0.27–0.45) 
for cancer mortality, and 0.18 (95% CI, 0.12–0.26) for cardiovascular 
disease mortality. The population-attributable risk of nonadherence to 5 
low-risk factors was 60.7% (95% CI, 53.6–66.7) for all-cause mortality, 
51.7% (95% CI, 37.1–62.9) for cancer mortality, and 71.7% (95% CI, 
58.1–81.0) for cardiovascular disease mortality. We estimated that the 
life expectancy at age 50 years was 29.0 years (95% CI, 28.3–29.8) for 
women and 25.5 years (95% CI, 24.7–26.2) for men who adopted zero 
low-risk lifestyle factors. In contrast, for those who adopted all 5 low-
risk factors, we projected a life expectancy at age 50 years of 43.1 years 
(95% CI, 41.3–44.9) for women and 37.6 years (95% CI, 35.8–39.4) for 
men. The projected life expectancy at age 50 years was on average 14.0 
years (95% CI, 11.8–16.2) longer among female Americans with 5 low-
risk factors compared with those with zero low-risk factors; for men, the 
difference was 12.2 years (95% CI, 10.1–14.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a healthy lifestyle could substantially reduce 
premature mortality and prolong life expectancy in US adults.

T
he United States is one of the wealthiest na-
tions worldwide, but Americans have a shorter 
life expectancy compared with residents of al-
most all other high-income countries,1,2 ranking 31st 
in the world for life expectancy at birth in 2015.3 In 
2014, with a total health expenditure per capita of 
$9402,4 the United States was ranked first in the world 
for health expenditure as a percent of gross domestic 
product (17.1%).4 However, the US healthcare system 
has focused primarily on drug discoveries and disease 
treatment rather than prevention. Chronic diseases 
such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are the 
most common and costly of all health problems but are 
largely preventable.5 It has been widely acknowledged 
that unhealthy lifestyles are major risk factors for vari-
ous chronic diseases and premature death.6
More than 2 decades ago, McGinnis and Foege7 and 
McGinnis and colleagues8 suggested that the nation’s 
major health policies should move to emphasize reduc-
ing unhealthy lifestyles. A meta-analysis9 of 15 studies 
including 531 
804 participants from 17 countries with 
a mean follow-up of 13.24 years suggested that ≈60% 
of premature deaths could be attributed to unhealthy 
lifestyle factors, including smoking, excessive alcohol 
consumption, physical inactivity, poor diet, and obesity. 
A healthy lifestyle was associated with an estimated in-
crease of 7.4 to 17.9 years in life expectancy in Japan,10 
the United Kingdom,11 Canada,12 Denmark,13 Norway,13 
and Germany.13,14 However, a comprehensive analysis 
of the impact of adopting low-risk lifestyle factors on 
life expectancy in the US population is lacking. There-
fore, our aim was to evaluate the potential impact of 
individual and combined lifestyle factors on premature 
death and life expectancy in the US population.
METHODS
The data, analytical methods, and study materials will be 
made available to other researchers from the corresponding 
authors on reasonable request for purposes of reproducing 
the results or replicating the procedure.
Overall Design
We first quantified the association between lifestyle-related 
low-risk factors and mortality on the basis of cohort data 
from the NHS (Nurses’ Health Study)15,16 and the HPFS (Health 
Professionals Follow-Up Study).17 Then, we used data from the 
NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys; 
2013–2014) to estimate the distribution of the lifestyle-related 
factors among the US population.18 Furthermore, we derived the 
death rates of Americans from the CDC WONDER (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for 
Epidemiologic Research) database.19 Finally, we combined the 
results from those 3 sources to estimate the extended life expec-
tancy associated with different categories of each individual life-
style factor and a combination of low-risk lifestyle factors.
Study Population
The NHS began in 1976, when 121 
700 female nurses 30 to 
55 years of age responded to a questionnaire gathering medi-
cal, lifestyle, and other health-related information. In 1980, 
92 
468 nurses also responded to a validated food frequency 
questionnaire.15,16 The HPFS17 was established in 1986, when 
51 
529 male US health professionals (dentists, optometrists, 
osteopaths, podiatrists, pharmacists, and veterinarians) 40 to 
75 years of age completed a mailed questionnaire about their 
medical history and lifestyle, including a food frequency ques-
tionnaire. We excluded participants with implausible energy 
intakes (women: <500 or >3500 kcal/d; men: <800 or >4200 
kcal/d), with a body mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m2 at base-
line, or with a missing value for BMI, physical activity, alco-
hol, or smoking. After these exclusions, 78 
865 female and 
44 
354 male participants remained in the analysis at baseline. 
The NHS and HPFS were approved by the institutional review 
board of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston; comple-
tion of the self-administered questionnaire was considered to 
imply informed consent.
We used the NHANES (2013–2014)18 to estimate the 
population distribution of lifestyle-related factors among 
American adults. The analytical population consisted of 2128 
adults 50 to 80 years of age with complete information on 
diet, BMI, physical activity, alcohol use, and smoking status. 
We also excluded participants with BMIs of <18.5 kg/m2. The 
NHANES18 included a nationally representative sample of the 
US population. It was approved by the National Center for 
Health Statistics research ethics review board. Signed con-
sents were obtained from all participants.
Data Collection
Diet in the NHS and HPFS was assessed every 4 years with a 
validated food frequency questionnaire asking the frequency, 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• A comprehensive analysis of the impact of adopt-
ing low-risk lifestyle factors on life expectancy in 
the US population is lacking.
• Adherence to 5 low-risk lifestyle-related factors 
(never smoking, a healthy weight, regular physical 
activity, a healthy diet, and moderate alcohol con-
sumption) could prolong life expectancy at age 50 
years by 14.0 and 12.2 years for female and male 
US adults compared with individuals who adopted 
zero low-risk lifestyle factors.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Americans could narrow the life-expectancy gap 
between the United States and other industrialized 
countries by adopting a healthier lifestyle.
• Prevention should be a top priority for national 
health policy, and preventive care should be an 
indispensable part of the US healthcare system.

on average, a participant had consumed a particular amount 
of a specific type of food during the previous year.15,16 Physical 
activity levels were investigated with a validated questionnaire 
and updated every 2 years.20 Body weight and smoking habits 
were self-reported and updated every 2 years. Alcohol con-
sumption was also collected by the food frequency question-
naire. Biennial questionnaires were used to collect information 
on potential confounders such as age, ethnicity, multivitamin 
use, regular aspirin use, postmenopausal hormone use (NHS 
only), and the presence or absence of a family history of dia-
betes mellitus, cancer, or myocardial infarction.
Dietary data in the NHANES18 were collected by an inter-
viewer-administered, computer-assisted, 24-hour dietary 
recall, which was an in-depth interview conducted by a 
trained interviewer who solicited detailed information about 
everything that the participant ate and drank in the prior 24 
hours. Body weight and height were measured in a mobile 
examination center with standardized techniques and equip-
ment. Smoking status was self-reported and included ques-
tions about numbers of cigarettes, pipes, or cigars smoked 
per day and whether the participant had smoked at least 
100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime. Participants also reported 
duration of moderate and vigorous physical activity during lei-
sure time and at work. Usual alcohol intakes were recorded by 
two 24-hour dietary recalls.18
Low-Risk Lifestyle Score
We included 5 lifestyle-related factors: diet, smoking, physi-
cal activity, alcohol consumption, and BMI. Because this 
study was focused on modifiable lifestyle factors, we did not 
include clinical risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholes-
terolemia, or medication use in the score.
Diet quality in the NHS, HPFS, and NHANES was assessed 
with the Alternate Healthy Eating Index score (Methods in 
the online-only Data Supplement), which is strongly associ-
ated with the onset of cardiometabolic disease in the general 
population.21–23 We defined a healthy diet as a diet score in 
the top 40% of each cohort distribution. For smoking, we 
defined low risk as never smoking. For physical activity, we 
classified low risk as >30 min/d of moderate or vigorous activ-
ities (including brisk walking) that require the expenditure of 
at least 3 metabolic equivalents per hour. We defined low-risk 
alcohol consumption as moderate alcohol consumption, for 
example, 5 to 15 g/d for women and 5 to 30 g/d for men. BMI 
was calculated as self-reported weight (kilograms) divided by 
height (meters squared). Low-risk body weight was defined as 
BMI in the range of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2.
For each low-risk factor, the participant received a score of 
1 if he or she met the criterion for low risk. If the participant 
did not meet the criterion, he or she was classified as high risk 
for that factor and received a score of 0. The sum of these 5 
scores provided a total number of low-risk factors of 0, 1, 2, 
3, 4, or 5, with higher scores indicating a healthier lifestyle.
Ascertainment of Deaths
In the NHS and HPFS, deaths were identified from state vital 
statistics records, the National Death Index, reports by the 
families, and the postal system.24 The follow-up for death in 
both cohorts was at least 98% complete. A physician reviewed 
death certificates or medical records to classify the cause of 
death according to International Classification of Diseases, 
Eighth Revision in the NHS (International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision in the HPFS).
We also derived the population all-cause, cardiovascular 
(I00–I99), and cancer mortality (C00–D48) rates for 2014 by 
sex and single-year ages ranging from 50 to 84 years from 
the CDC WONDER database of the US population.19 Because 
the database provides mortality rates only up to age of 84, 
we estimated the all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates 
in single years of age from 85 to 105 years by extrapolation 
based on a Poisson regression model with both linear and 
quadratic terms for the midpoints of single-year age groups 
minus age of 49.5 years (Methods and Figure I in the online-
only Data Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Participants contributed person-time from the return of 
the baseline questionnaire (NHS, 1980; HPFS, 1986) until 
the date of death or the end of the follow-up period (June 
30, 2014, for NHS and January 30, 2014, for HPFS), which-
ever came first. We used Cox proportional hazard models 
to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause, 
cancer, and cardiovascular mortality with their 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) across categories of each individual 
factor and joint classification of number of low-risk factors 
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
Because lifestyle factors may affect mortality risk over an 
extended period of time, to best represent long-term effects, 
we calculated cumulative average levels of lifestyle factors 
using the latest 2 repeated measurements for our primary 
analysis of diet, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. For 
example, in the NHS, mortality cases that occurred between 
1980 and 1982 were examined in relation to physical activ-
ity on the basis of data collected on the 1980 questionnaire, 
the average of the 1980 and 1982 physical activity measure-
ments was used to assess risk of mortality in the 1982 to 
1984 follow-up period, the average of the 1982 and 1984 
physical activity measurements was used to assess risk of mor-
tality in the 1984 to 1986 follow-up period, and so forth. For 
dietary Alternate Healthy Eating Index score and alcohol use, 
the average was calculated on the basis of 4-year repeated 
measurements. Smoking status was estimated from both 
smoking history and most recent status updated every other 
year and classified into 5 categories: never, past, and current 
smoking of 1 to 14, 15 to 24, and ≥25 cigarettes per day. To 
minimize the reverse causality bias resulting from weight loss 
caused by preexisting illness, we applied the lifelong maxi-
mum BMI.25 For example, we applied the maximum value of 
BMI at age 18 years and BMI in 1980 to predict mortality 
between 1980 and 1982 and the maximum value of BMI at 
age 18 years, BMI in 1980, and BMI in 1982 to predict mortal-
ity between 1982 and 1984, and so forth. The same analytical 
strategy was applied to the HPFS. If data on low-risk factors 
were missing at a given time point, the last observation was 
carried forward. The following covariates were included in 
the multivariable model: age, ethnicity, current multivitamin 
use, current aspirin use, menopausal status and hormone use 
(women only), and family history of diabetes mellitus, myo-
cardial infarction, or cancer. We applied a competing-risk 
regression model for cause-specific mortality by including

lifestyle factors as exposure and other risk factors as uncon-
strained covariates, allowing the effects of the covariates to 
vary across cause-specific mortality.26
We calculated the hypothetical population-attributable 
risk, an estimation of the percentage of premature mortal-
ity in the study population that theoretically would not have 
occurred if all people had been in the low-risk category, assum-
ing that the observed associations represent causal effects. 
For these analyses, we used a single binary categorical vari-
able (with all 5 low-risk factors) and compared participants in 
the low-risk category with the rest of the population (without 
all 5 low-risk factors or with any high-risk factor) to calculate 
the HRs. We combined these HRs with the prevalence of the 
low-risk category among American adults based on NHANES 
data to estimate the population-attributable risk.27
To calculate the life expectancy of participants following 
different levels of healthy lifestyles, we used life tables. We 
built the life table starting at age 50 years and ending at age 
105 years with the following 3 estimates to calculate the 
cumulative survival from 50 years onward: (1) sex- and age-
specific HRs of mortality associated with numbers of low-risk 
lifestyles derived from the NHS and HPFS; (2) sex- and age-
specific population mortality rate of all causes, cardiovascular 
mortality (I00–I99), and cancer mortality (C00–D48) from the 
US CDC WONDER database19; and (3) age- and sex-specific 
population prevalence of the number of low-risk lifestyles 
derived from the NHANES.18 We fitted multivariable-adjusted 
Cox regression models for each sex separately to calculate 
the age-specific HRs for mortality by the number of low-
risk factors compared with zero low-risk factors. The model 
specification included linear and quadratic terms for the age 
variable (every 5 years up to 85 years) and the interactions 
between the number of low-risk factors and linear and qua-
dratic terms of the age variable. The age-specific HRs for mor-
tality were obtained as linear combinations of the relevant 
estimated coefficients, with age fixed at values corresponding 
to midpoints of 5-year age groups from age 50 to 85 years. 
The HR of age >85 years was assumed to be the same as that 
in the 85-year age group. Then we applied the age- and sex-
specific HRs to estimate the life expectancy at different ages 
by the number of low-risk lifestyle factors (online-only Data 
Supplement).
In the sensitivity analysis, we applied the sex-specific HRs 
(adjusted for age only) for all-cause and cause-specific mor-
tality to test the robustness of our findings. To address the 
potential aging effect on the association between lifestyle 
and mortality, we conducted a sensitivity analysis limited to 
NHS and HPFS participants <75 years of age. We conducted 
3 stratified analyses: 1 analysis stratified by smoking status, 
another stratified by BMI status to estimate the joint effect 
of other 4 lifestyle factors, and the third stratified by baseline 
disease status (with or without elevated cholesterol, hyper-
tension, or diabetes mellitus). To address the concern about 
the potential adverse effects of moderate alcohol intake, we 
created a healthy lifestyle score that was based on the other 4 
low-risk factors without alcohol.
Because the binary variables could not account for the 
gradient in mortality risk with more extreme levels of these 
lifestyle factors, we conducted a third sensitivity analysis in 
which we calculated an expanded low-risk score on the basis 
of the associations between each lifestyle factor and mortality 
in the cohorts. We assigned scores of 1 (least healthy) to 5 
(most healthy) to the categories of the lifestyle factors and 
summed the points across all 5 factors (score range, 5–25 
points). For this analysis, the healthiest group was defined as 
never smoking, BMI between 18.5 and 22.9 kg/m2, moder-
ate alcohol intake (5–14.9 g/d), moderate or vigorous activity 
duration of ≥6 h/wk, and the highest quintile of the Alternate 
Healthy Eating Index diet score.
We used SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) to 
analyze the data. Statistical significance was set at a 2-tailed 
value of P<0.05. We used Monte Carlo simulation (paramet-
ric bootstrapping) with 10 000 runs to calculate the CIs of 
the life expectancy estimation with @RISK 7.5 (Palisade Corp, 
Ithaca, NY).
RESULTS
At baseline, participants with a higher number of low-
risk lifestyle factors were slightly younger, more likely to 
use aspirin, and less likely to use multivitamin supple-
ments (Table 1). During a median of 33.9 years of fol-
low-up of women and 27.2 years of follow-up of men, 
42 
167 deaths were recorded (13 
953 deaths resulting 
from cancer and 10 
689 deaths caused by CVD).
Each individual component of a healthy lifestyle 
showed a significant association with risk of total mor-
tality, cancer mortality, and CVD mortality (Table 2). A 
combination of 5 low-risk lifestyle factors was associ-
ated with an HR of 0.26 (95% CI, 0.22–0.31) for all-
cause mortality, 0.35 (95% CI, 0.27–0.45) for cancer 
mortality, and 0.18 (95% CI, 0.12–0.26) for CVD mor-
tality compared with participants with zero low-risk 
factors. The population-attributable risk of nonadher-
ence to 5 low-risk lifestyle factors was 60.7% (95% 
CI, 53.6–66.7) for all-cause mortality, 51.7% (95% CI, 
37.1–62.9%) for cancer mortality, and 71.7% (95% CI, 
58.1–81.0) for cardiovascular mortality. We observed 
a similar association between the low-risk lifestyle fac-
tors and mortality before 75 years of age (Table I in the 
online-only Data Supplement). The low-risk lifestyle fac-
tors were associated with lower risk of cause-specific 
mortality in women and men similarly (Figure II in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
We observed a modest difference in HRs across age 
groups (Figure 1A). Using these age- and sex-specific 
HRs, we estimated that the life expectancy at age 50 
years was 29.0 years (95% CI, 28.3–29.8) for wom-
en and 25.5 years (95% CI, 24.7–26.2) for men who 
adopted zero low-risk lifestyle factors. In contrast, for 
those who adopted all 5 low-risk factors, we projected 
a life expectancy at age 50 years of 43.1 years (95% 
CI, 41.3–44.9) for women and 37.6 years (95% CI, 
35.8–39.4) for men (Figure 1B). Equivalently, women 
with 5 low-risk lifestyle factors could gain 14.0 years 
(95% CI, 11.8–16.8) of life expectancy on average, 
and men could gain 12.2 years (95% CI, 10.1–14.2) of 
life expectancy compared with those with zero low-risk

lifestyle factors (Figure 1C). The preceding inferences 
were similar in sensitivity analyses using sex-specific 
HRs adjusted for age (Figure IIIA and IIIB in the online-
only Data Supplement). Among women, on average, 
≈30.8% of the gained life expectancy at age 50 years 
from adopting 5 versus zero low-risk lifestyle factors 
was attributable to reduced CVD death and the remain-
der to lower cancer (21.2%) or other causes (48.0%) 
of mortality. For men, the corresponding percentage 
was 34.1%, 22.8%, and 43.1%, respectively (Figure 
IIIC in the online-only Data Supplement). We observed 
a consistent dose-response relationship between the 
increasing number of low-risk factors and gained life 
expectancy among both smokers and nonsmokers 
(Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement), among 
both normal-weight and overweight adults (Figure V 
in the online-only Data Supplement), and among indi-
viduals with and without chronic conditions at baseline 
(Figure VI in the online-only Data Supplement).
In a sensitivity analysis using a low-risk score with-
out moderate alcohol intake, the projected life expec-
tancy at age 50 years was on average 11.4 years (95% 
CI, 9.5–13.3) longer among female Americans with 4

Supplement).
We also estimated the gained life expectancy related 
to each of the lifestyle factors. As expected, increased 
exercise, not smoking or a reduced amount of smoking 
if a smoker, a healthy dietary pattern, moderate alcohol 
intake, and optimal body weight were all associated with 
longer life expectancy (Figure 2). The estimate based on 
the expanded low-risk score indicated a 20.5-year differ-
ence in life expectancy at age 50 years in women (19.6 
years among men) who adhered to the highest expand-
ed lifestyle score compared with the lowest expanded 
score (Figure VIII in the online-only Data Supplement).

DISCUSSION
We estimated that adherence to 5 low-risk lifestyle-
related factors could prolong life expectancy at age 
50 years by 14.0 and 12.2 years for female and male 
US adults, respectively, compared with individuals who 
adopted zero low-risk lifestyle factors. These estimates 
suggest that Americans could narrow the life-expectan-
cy gap between the United States and other industrial-
ized countries by adopting a healthier lifestyle. In 2014, 
the life expectancy for American adults at age 50 years 
was 33.3 years for women and 29.8 years for men.28 We 
estimated that the life expectancies were 29.0 years for 
women and 25.5 years for men if they had zero low-risk 
factors but could be extended to 43.1 years for women 
and 37.6 years for men if they adopted all 5 low-risk 
factors. However, in US adults, adherence to a low-risk 
lifestyle pattern has decreased during the last 3 decades, 
from 15% in 1988 to 1992 to 8% in 2001 to 2006,29 
driven primarily by the increasing prevalence of obesity.
The life expectancy of Americans increased from 62.9 
years in 1940 to 76.8 years in 2000 and 78.8 years in 
2014.28 This increase could be the result of a number 
of factors such as improvements in living standards, 
improved medical treatment, substantial reduction in 
smoking,30 and a modest improvement in diet quality.23 
However, some unhealthy lifestyle factors may have 
counterbalanced the gain in life expectancy, particularly 
the increasing obesity epidemic30,31 and decreasing physi-
cal activity levels.32 In our study, three fourths of prema-
ture CVD deaths and half of premature cancer deaths in 
the United States could be attributed to lack of adher-
ence to a low-risk lifestyle. There is still much potential 
for improvement in health and life expectancy, which 
depends not only on an individual’s efforts but also on 
the food, physical, and policy environments.33,34 A re-
cent study found that low-income residents in relatively 
wealthy areas such as New York and San Francisco had 
significantly longer life expectancies than those in poorer 
regions such as Gary, IN, and Detroit.35 This phenomenon 
suggests that the living environment contributes to life 
expectancy beyond socioeconomic status. For instance, 
residents in affluent cities have more access to public 
health services and less exposure to smoking because 
of the more restricted policies on smoking in public.35 
Studies36 have linked healthy eating and exercise habits 
with built, social, and socioeconomic environment assets 
(access to parks, social ties, affluence) and unhealthy be-
haviors with built environment inhibitors (access to fast 
food outlets), suggesting that supporting environments 
for health lifestyle should be 1 part of the promotion of 
longevity for the US population. Prevention should be a 
top priority for national health policy, and preventive care 
should be an indispensable part of the healthcare system.
Our estimation of gained life expectancy by adopting 
a low-risk lifestyle was broadly consistent with previous 
studies. A healthy lifestyle was associated with an esti-
mated greater life expectancy of 8.3 years (women) and 
10.3 years (men) in Japan,10 17.9 years in Canada,12 and 
13.9 years (women) and 17.0 years (men) in Germany,14 
as well as 14 years’ difference in chronological age in the 
United Kingdom.11 Data from 3 European cohorts from 
Denmark, Germany, and Norway13 suggested that men 
and women 50 years of age who had a favorable lifestyle 
would live 7.4 to 15.7 years longer than those with an 
unfavorable lifestyle. These estimates were somewhat 
different because of different definitions of a low-risk 
lifestyle and study population characteristics.10,12–14
We observed that a healthy diet pattern, moder-
ate alcohol consumption, nonsmoking status, a normal 
weight, and regular physical activity were each associ-
ated with a low risk of premature mortality. Smoking is 
a strong independent risk factor of cancer, diabetes mel-
litus, CVDs, and mortality potentially through inducing 
oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, and smoking 
cessation has been associated with a reduction of these 
excess risks.37–39 A healthy dietary pattern and its major 
food components have been associated with lower risk 
of morbidities and mortality of diabetes mellitus, CVD, 
cancer, and neurodegenerative disease,40 and its poten-
tial health benefits have been replicated in clinical trials.41 
Physical activity and weight control significantly reduced 
the risk of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk factors, 
and breast cancer.42–44 Although no long-term trial of al-
cohol consumption on chronic disease risk has been con-
ducted, cardiovascular benefits of moderate alcohol con-
sumption have been consistently observed in large cohort 
studies.45 Results of our sensitivity analysis further indicat-
ed that combinations of the healthy lifestyle factors were 
particularly powerful: the larger the number of low-risk 
lifestyle factors, the longer the potential prolonged life 
expectancy, regardless of the combined factors.5
A major strength of this study is the long follow-up 
of 2 large cohorts with detailed and repeated measure-
ments of diet and lifestyle and low rates of loss to follow-
up. Another important strength is the combination of the 
cohort estimates with a nationally representative study, 
the NHANES, which improved the generalizability of our 
findings. Although the HRs between lifestyle factors and 
mortality were estimated from only our cohort data, they 
were similar to those published in other populations.9–14 
Because our cohorts included mostly white health pro-
fessionals, we could not specifically examine the overall 
impact of lifestyle adherence among different ethnic sub-

groups; further studies are warranted to examine the im-
pact of lifestyle factors in other ethnic and racial groups.
The current study has several limitations. First, diet 
and lifestyle factors were self-reported; thus, measure-
ment errors are inevitable. However, the use of repeated 
measures of these variables could reduce measurement 
errors and represent long-term diet and lifestyle. Second, 
we counted the number of lifestyle factors on the ba-
sis of the dichotomized value of each lifestyle factor, al-
though the lifestyle factors were differentially associated 
with mortality. However, our analysis based on an ex-
panded score considered different levels of each risk fac-
tor and yielded similar results. Third, we did not fully con-
sider the baseline comorbid conditions and background 
medical therapies. Although our stratification analysis by 
baseline chronic conditions of diabetes mellitus, hyper-
tension, and elevated cholesterol provided some support 
for the hypothesis that adopting a healthy lifestyle is im-
portant for both healthy individuals and those with exist-
ing chronic conditions, further studies among individuals 
with diagnosed cancer and CVDs are warranted.
CONCLUSIONS
We estimate that adherence to a low-risk lifestyle could 
prolong life expectancy at age 50 years by 14.0 and 
12.2 years in female and male US adults compared with 
individuals without any of the low-risk lifestyle factors. 
Our findings suggest that the gap in life expectancy be-
tween the United States and other developed countries 
could be narrowed by improving lifestyle factors.
