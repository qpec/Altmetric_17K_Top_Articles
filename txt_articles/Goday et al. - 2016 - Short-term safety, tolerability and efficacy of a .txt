BRACKGROUND: The safety and tolerability of very low-calorie-ketogenic (VLCK) diets are a current concern in the treatment of
obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluating the short-term safety and tolerability of a VLCK diet (o50 g of carbohydrate daily) in an interventional
weight loss program including lifestyle and behavioral modification support (Diaprokal Method) in subjects with T2DM.
METHODS: Eighty-nine men and women, aged between 30 and 65 years, with T2DM and body mass index between 30 and
35 kg m−2 participated in this prospective, open-label, multi-centric randomized clinical trial with a duration of 4 months. Forty-five
subjects were randomly assigned to the interventional weight loss (VLCK diet), and 44 to the standard low-calorie diet.
RESULTS: No significant differences in the laboratory safety parameters were found between the two study groups. Changes in the
urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in VLCK diet were not significant and were comparable to control group. Creatinine and blood
urea nitrogen did not change significantly relative to baseline nor between groups. Weight loss and reduction in waist
circumference in the VLCK diet group were significantly larger than in control subjects (both Po0.001). The decline in HbA1c and
glycemic control was larger in the VLCK diet group (Po0.05). No serious adverse events were reported and mild AE in the VLCK diet
group declined at last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The interventional weight loss program based on a VLCK diet is most effective in reducing body weight and
improvement of glycemic control than a standard hypocaloric diet with safety and good tolerance for T2DM patients.

INTRODUCTION
Medical nutritional therapy aiming at weight loss is a mainstay of
treatment for obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM).1 An interplay between human obesity and T2DM was
strongly confirmed in numerous epidemiological studies2 and
both diseases are rapidly growing in parallel worldwide with major
health consequences. In fact, weight loss has been associated with
an improvement not only in glycemic control but also in other
cardiovascular risk factors commonly altered in subjects with
T2DM.3,4 Nonetheless, long-term non-pharmacologic weight loss
interventions for adults with T2DM have shown limited efficacy.5
Thus, alternative weight loss strategies that are safe and effective
in subjects with T2DM are in need.
The optimal degree of caloric restriction and macronutrient
distribution of medical nutritional therapy in T2DM is not well
defined. A systematic review of weight loss interventions in
subjects with T2DM revealed that interventions including very
low-calorie diets (VLCD) along with moderate physical activity and
behavioral intervention produced the largest effect.5 Although the
number of randomized clinical trials assessing the efficacy of VLCD
in subjects with T2DM is limited, data suggest considerable weight
loss, improved beta-cell function, and improved quality of life
associated with short-term VLCD.5–11 However, in 2008 the
American Diabetes Association stated as part of its nutrition
recommendations for diabetes that VLCD appeared to have
limited utility in the treatment of T2DM and should only be
considered
in
conjunction
with
a
structured
weight
loss
program.12 On the other hand, evidence suggests that there are
not an ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein and
fat for all people with diabetes; therefore, macronutrient distribu-
tion should be based on individualized assessment of current
eating patterns, preferences and metabolic goals. Although
numerous studies have attempted to identify the optimal mix of
macronutrients for the meal plans of people with diabetes, recent
systematic review13 found that there is no ideal mix that applies
broadly for successful weight loss in subjects with T2DM and that
macronutrient proportions should be individualized.14 It has been
claimed that high-protein diets may help promote weight loss,
maintain lean body mass, and improve lipid and plasma glucose
profiles in obese subjects with our without T2DM15–18 and prevent

 hepatic steatosis in obese animal models.19 However, concern has
been raised that increased protein intake, could cause deteriora-
tion of renal function particularly in those with microalbuminuria
or established diabetic nephropathy,20 and that high-protein
interventions are not feasible in a 'real-world setting.21 In addition,
short-term studies have shown that reducing total carbohydrate
intake is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic
control.13 Conversely, current standards of care of the American
Diabetes Association for the subject with T2DM state that the
recommended daily allowance for digestible carbohydrate is
130 g per day to provide adequate glucose as the required fuel for
the central nervous system without reliance on glucose produc-
tion from ingested protein or fat.1
Against this background, the primary aim of our study was to
evaluate the short-term safety and tolerability of a low-carbohy-
drate, ketogenic diet (o50 g of carbohydrate daily; VLCK diet) as
part of an interventional weight loss program including lifestyle
and behavioral modification support (Diaprokal Method) in
subjects with T2DM. As secondary aims, we compared weight
loss and changes in metabolic parameters between subjects
following the interventional weight loss program or a low-fat
hypocaloric diet together with a lifestyle and behavioral modifica-
tion program made available by the health-care provider.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Subjects
Eighty-nine men and women participated in our prospective, open-label,
multi-centric randomized clinical trial with a duration of 4 months and
parallel group design. Eligibility criteria for the study included age between
30 and 65 years, previous diagnosis of T2DM and body mass index
between 30 and 35 kg m−2. Exclusion criteria included duration of T2DM
longer than 10 years, insulin therapy, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ⩾ 9% and
fasting C-peptide o1 ng ml − 1. In addition, subjects presenting with
impaired renal function (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate
o60 ml min–1 per 1.73 m2), impaired liver function (defined as liver
enzymes greater than equal to twofold the upper normal limit), alcohol
intake ⩾ 40 g per day for men and ⩾ 24 g per day for women, pregnancy,
lactation, or severe eating or psychiatric disorder according to the
investigator criterion were excluded from the study.
Study participants were recruited in the Endocrinology departments of
seven participating Centers across Spain. Centralized approval was granted
by the Ethics Committee of one of the participating Centers (Institut
Municipal d’Assistència Sanitària, Hospital del Mar) and thereafter ratified
by the local Ethics Committee at each participating site. Written informed
consent was obtained from all study participants prior to randomization.
Randomization to one of the two study groups was stratified by
participating Center.
Study design and dietary interventions
The 4-month dietary intervention in subjects randomly assigned to the
interventional weight loss following a VLCK diet (VLCK diet group) as part
of a commercial weight-loss program (DiaproKal Method) based on a high-
biological-value protein preparations diet and natural foods or to a low-
calorie diet (LC diet group) based on the ADA (American Diabetes
Association) guidelines.1
The intervention for both groups included an evaluation by the
specialist physician conducting the study, an assessment by an expert
dietician, group meetings and exercise recommendations. Individual
counseling to support lifestyle and behavioral modification throughout
the study was performed according to a structured support program by an
endocrinologist and a registered dietitian at each participating center in
the LC diet group. The registered dietitian in the VLCK diet group was an
employee of the company supporting the interventional program and
used the same structured support plan as in the LC diet group. The
program included nine individual sessions and a telephone contact every
15 days in both study arms.
VLCK diet
The methodology in VLCK diet group was similar to that used in another
recently published study evaluated the efficacy of a VLCK diet as part of a
commercial weight loss program (Pronokal Method) in obesity.22 Each
protein preparation contained 15 g protein, 4 g carbohydrates, 3 g fat and
three specific active ingredients, (20 μg chromium, 0.8 g Ginseng and
0.4 mg Biotin); and provided 90–100 kcal. This method has three stages:
active, metabolic stabilization and maintenance. The active stage consists
of a very low-calorie diet (600–800 kcal per day), low in carbohydrates
(o50 g daily from vegetables) and lipids (only 10 g of olive oil per day).
The amount of high-biological-value proteins ranged between 0.8 and
1.2 g per each Kg of ideal body weight, to ensure meeting the minimal
body requirements and to prevent the loss of lean mass. This method
produces three ketogenic phases. In phase 1, the patients eat high-
biological-value protein preparations five times a day, and vegetables with
low glycemic index. In phase 2, one of the protein servings is substituted
by a natural protein (for example, meat and fish) either at lunch or at
dinner. In the phase 3, a second serve of the natural protein low in fat
substituted the second serve of biological protein preparation. Throughout
these ketogenic phases, supplements of vitamins and minerals, such as K,
Na, Mg, Ca and omega-3 fatty acids, were provided in accordance to
international recommendations. This active stage is maintained until the
patient loses most of weight loss target, ideally 90%. Hence, the ketogenic
phases were variable in time depending on the individual and the weight
loss target, but they lasted between 30 and 45 days in total.
In the metabolic stabilization stage, the ketogenic phases were ended
by the physician in charge of the patient based on the amount of weight
lost, and started a low-calorie diet. At this point, the patients underwent a
progressive incorporation of different food groups and participated in a
program of alimentary re-education to guarantee the long-term main-
tenance of the weight lost. The maintenance stage consists of an eating
plan balanced in carbohydrates, protein and fat. Based on each individual’s
basal metabolic rate as determined by the Harris Benedic equation, the
calories consumed ranged between 1500 and 2250 kcal per day and the
target was to maintain the lost weight and promote healthy life styles.
LC diet
The LC diet was aimed at a daily energy restriction of 500–1000 kcal
according to each individual’s basal metabolic rate. Macronutrient dietary
composition aimed at a daily intake of o30% of calories coming from fat,
10–20% from protein and 45–60% from carbohydrates.
Safety and tolerability assessment
Safety parameters included renal function (plasma creatinine, blood urea
nitrogen, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated Glomerular
Filtration Rate using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study
equation MDRD-eGFR), liver function (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
aminotransferase and total bilirubin) and plasma uric acid, sodium and
potassium. These parameters were performed using automatic standard
procedures (Cobas c711, Roche-Spain) and a Coulter LH 750 Hematology
Analyzer, (Beckman Coulter, Inc.; Brea CA, USA). Beta-hydroxibutirate was
measured from capillary blood (Optium Xceed Blood Glucose and Ketone
Monitoring System; Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA). The method
performed to detect microalbuminuria was the albumin/creatinine ratio
(μg mg − 1) measured in spot urine samples. Diagnosis of microalbuminuria
was defined when the spot collection was 30–300 μg mg − 1 creatinine.
Safety parameters were assessed at baseline and at 2 weeks, 2 months
(visit 5) and 4 months (visit 9, end of the study) following randomization.
Capillary ketones were assessed at each study visit. Tolerability was
assessed as the percentage of patients completing the 6–10 weeks
pre-defined period of VLCK diet, and the incidence of pre-defined or
unexpected adverse events (AE) throughout the study period.
Anthropometrical and biochemical assessment
Body weight, body mass index and waist circumference were performed
according to previously describe standardized procedures.22
As glucose homeostasis parameters fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and
insulin were quantified. The HOMA-IR (Homeostasis Model Assessment for
Insulin Resistance) was estimated as previously reported23 and a HOMA-
IR43.2 was considered as indicative of insulin resistance.22 Lipid profile
analysis included fasting plasma triglycerides and total-, low-density
lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

 Dietary adherence and patient satisfaction were assessed by the Eating
Self-Efficacy Scale and Liker Scale (1 = very unsatisfied, 2 = unsatisfied,
3 = indifferent, 4 = satisfied, 5 = very satisfied), respectively. Changes in
the laboratory parameters were performed using automatic standard
procedures (Cobas c711, Roche-Spain, Madrid, Spain) and a Coulter LH 750
Hematology Analyzer, (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) and were calculated as
the difference between the baseline values and those at the end of
the study.
Statistical analysis
Sample size was calculated based on a previously reported 7% occurrence
of AE in subjects participating in a randomized clinical trial evaluating
weight-loss dietary interventions differing in macronutrient composition.24
Accordingly, a sample size of 38 subjects per group was estimated
necessary to validate the hypothesis that the occurrence of AE would
be equivalent in the two study groups, with an alpha error of 0.05
and a statistical power of 80%. A dropout rate of 15% was anticipated in
both study groups. Thus, we aimed at recruiting a total of 45 subjects
per group.
Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis System
software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Analysis of the
safety and tolerability (safety population) variables was performed with an
intention-to-treat analysis with baseline or last observation carried forward
when the complete set of data for an individual was not available. Changes
in body weight, BMI and waist circumference between groups were
compared in the 'efficacy population', composed by those with at least one
efficacy measurement available after randomization. Data on continuous
variables are expressed as mean ± s.d. unless stated otherwise. Categorical
variables are described as percentage and number of valid observations.
Other secondary measures were compared between groups at each study
visit. No imputations for missing values were performed. Differences
between groups were evaluated using parametric or non-parametric test
as appropriate (χ2 or Fisher’s test for categorical variables, and analysis
of variance or Mann–Whitney U-test). Statistical significance was set at a
P-value o0.05.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of patients
The main clinical characteristics of the study participants are
shown in Table 1. A total of 89 subjects were randomized to the
low-calorie, ketogenic diet (VLCK diet) group (n = 45) or the usual
care low-calorie (LC diet) group (n = 44). Attrition by completion of
study visits was not different between groups (VLCK diet: 11.1%
(5/45), LC diet: 18.2% (8/44); P = 0.384). Anthropometric and
metabolic parameters at baseline were comparable between the
two study groups (Table 1).
Diet-induced changes in safety parameters
As expected by design, capillary blood β-hidroxibutirate concen-
tration was larger in the VLCK diet group over the VLCK diet time
period and for the remaining of follow-up (Figure 1a). Ketonemia
positive (⩾0.3 mmol l − 1) were detected in 91.1% of subjects of
VLCK diet group during follow-up. The largest mean capillary
ketonemia in the VLCK diet group during the study was recorded
at 2 weeks follow-up (1.15 ± 0.96 mmol l − 1). The study participant
with a ketonemia of 4.2 mmol l − 1 did not present a random
glucose 4250 mg dl − 1 or a pHo7.3. Despite this fact, no
significant differences in the laboratory safety parameters were
found between the two study groups (Figure 1). Changes from
baseline in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (Figure 1b) and
estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate using the Modification of Diet
in Renal Disease study equation (Figure 1c) in the VLCK diet group
were not statistically significant through the intervention period,
and no differences were observed between the two weight loss
strategies. Regarding to microalbuminuria diagnosis (UARC ⩾
30–300 μg mg − 1), it was present in 6.3% in the VLCK diet group
and in 17.6% of the LC diet group without reach statistically
significant differences between groups (P = 0.156) at the end of
the study. Likewise, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen did not

 change significantly within study groups at the 2- or 4 months
evaluations relative to baseline nor between groups (data not
shown). Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase
were slightly albeit significantly larger in the VLCK diet group as
compared with the LC group at 2 weeks (alanine aminotransfer-
ase: 45.16 vs 26.85 IU ml − 1, Po0.005; aspartate aminotransferase:
38.53 vs 22.15 IU ml − 1, Po0.001) but not at the end of follow-up
(4 months), (Figure 1d). Percentage of subjects in the VLCK diet
group who presented with alanine aminotransferase or aspartate
aminotransferase plasma concentration threefold higher than the
upper limit of the normal range was not significantly different
compared with controls (0%; P = 0.157). Bilirubin plasma concen-
tration remained invariable all over the study and did not differ
between groups. At all-time points, sodium, potassium, chloride,
calcium and magnesium remained stable and within the normal
limits in the two study groups. Finally, mean uric acid level was
larger in the VLCK diet group at 2 weeks (P = 0.021), but not at
2- or 4 months (data not shown).
Among the 45 subjects allocated to the VLCK diet group,
7 (15.6%) discontinued the low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet
(o50 g of carbohydrate daily) before 6 weeks whereas 29 (64.4%)
completed at least the pre-defined maximum of 10 weeks. No
serious AE were reported. Mild AE were reported by 80% of the
VLCK diet subjects as compared with 41% of the subjects in
the control group (Table 2; Po0.001). Among the pre-defined
AE, asthenia, headache, nausea and vomiting were more common
in VLCK diet group at 2 weeks (all Po0.05). The number of
subjects reporting these AE in the VLCK diet group declined at last
follow-up. At the end of the study, constipation (Po0.005) and
orthostatic hypotension (Po0.05) were more commonly referred
by subjects in the VLCK diet group (respectively, n = 8 and n = 6)
compared with control subjects (both, n = 0). Not pre-defined
AE were more frequent in the VLCK diet group at 2 weeks but not
at 4 months (Table 2). Only one patient in the VLCK diet group
discontinued the study because of an AE consisting of nausea
associated with ketosis, a patient for not obesity related surgery
and the rest by personal choice.
Diet-induced changes in efficacy parameters
At 4 months, weight loss and reduction in waist circumference in
subjects in the VLCK diet group were significantly larger than in
control subjects (both Po0.001; Table 3). At completion of the
study, 485% of the VLCK diet subjects achieved a weight loss
410% relative to baseline. Fasting plasma glucose decreased
significantly in the two study groups (both Po0.05 relative to
baseline),
although
the
decline
in
HbA1c
was
statistically
significant only in the VLCK diet group (Po0.0001; Table 3).
Relevantly, insulin sensitivity as assessed from HOMA-IR at the end
of follow-up was statistically lower than in LC diet group (3.51 vs
4.61; Po0.05). Regarding to plasma lipid profile at 4 months, no
statistically significant changes were observed in total cholesterol,
LDL-C and HDL-C in both diet groups, but the VLCK diet induced a
statistically significant decrease in triglycerides (P = 0.004), which
was not observed in the LC diet group (Table 3).
Dietary adherence as assessed from the Eating Self-Efficacy Scale
was comparable between the two study groups. Finally, patients in
the VLCK diet group rated more satisfactory the weight loss
intervention they had been allocated to. At 4 months, 92.5% of the
participants in the VLCK diet group and 68.5% in the control group
deemed the intervention satisfactory or very satisfactory (P =0.005).
DISCUSSION
Our data show that VLCK diet (a low-calorie-ketogenic diet, o50 g
of carbohydrate daily) as part of a interventional weight loss
program including lifestyle and behavioral modification support

 over a 4-month period is a safe, well tolerated, and accepted
medical nutritional therapy option for subjects with T2DM.
Furthermore, VLCK diet intervention in subjects with T2DM is
associated with significantly larger weight loss along with
amelioration of glycemic control as compared with a standard
care nutritional intervention based on the ADA guidelines.
The short-term efficacy of an intense caloric restriction as that
reported herein for weight loss in T2DM and before bariatric
surgery is well established.5–11 Our study adds to the field on the
potential validity of increasing the protein content and decreasing
the carbohydrate content in a VLCK diet as a safe and effective
approach to medical nutritional therapy in T2DM.
The optimal mix of macronutrients of medical nutritional
therapy for people with T2DM remains unsolved.1,13 However,
although consensus is lacking, diets high in protein are commonly
seen as less appropriate for subjects with T2DM specially if micro-
or macro-albuminuria are present because of the concept that
reducing protein intake appears to slightly slow progression to

Very low-calorie-ketogenic diet safety in T2DM
A Goday et al

 renal failure.13,25 Our data show that a 30–53% daily caloric
content as protein does not result in increased appearance or
worsening of albuminuria, nor deterioration of plasma creatinine
over the course of a 4-month intervention, neither changes in
eGFR in T2DM subjects with or without albuminuria but without
chronic kidney disease at baseline. These findings are similar to
previous report that evidenced that a low-carbohydrate diet is as
safe as Mediterranean or low-fat diets in preserving renal function
among moderately obese participants with or without T2DM.26
It has been proposed that diets aiming at weight loss that are high
in protein may be advantageous because of increased satiety despite
negative energy balance, and sustained basal energy expenditure
despite body weight loss due to a sparing of fat-free mass.27 Thus,
the relatively high-percent protein content of our dietary plan could
be viewed as protein sparing. That is, a strategy to avoid the ensuing
reduction of total daily protein intake associated with energy
restricted diets.27 Admittedly, the percent daily protein intake in
our study subjects corresponds to 1.0–1.6 g of protein intake/actual
body weight/day. Thus, it is of note, that lack of detrimental effect on
renal parameters in our series was found in the context of larger
protein intakes than those tested in clinical trials examining the
effects of varying amounts of daily protein intake in subjects with or
without diabetic kidney disease at baseline.13,28,29
The macronutrient mix used in the VLCK diet group is also
characterized by carbohydrate content well below the 130 g
recommended daily allowance,1 throughout the 6–10 initial weeks
(32–89 g carbohydrate per day). VLCK diets have been shown to
have beneficial effects on weight loss, insulin sensitivity and
HbA1c in most studies.13,30 A study in which 84 patients with
obesity and T2DM were randomized to either a low-carbohydrate,
ketogenic diet or a low-glycemic, reduced-calorie diet over a
24-week period in patients with obesity and T2DM, showed diet
lower in carbohydrate led to greater improvements in glycemic
control (hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin) and
weight loss, and more frequent medication reduction/ elimination
than the low glycemic index diet.31
A low-carbohydrate intake results in a lower circulating insulin/
glucagon ratio, which promotes a high level of serum non-esterified
fatty acids used for oxidation and resulting in production of ketone
bodies. Accordingly, periodic testing of capillary ketones yielded
higher values in subjects in the VLCK diet group as compared with
those in the LC diet group, with 91.1% of subjects with positive
ketonemia (only the values of β-hidroxibutirate ⩾ 0.3 mmol l −1).
However, in all but one of the subjects in the VLCK diet group
capillary beta-hydroxibutirate concentration remained lower than
that typically observed in diabetic ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetic
subjects.32 The reasons for such a markedly elevated ketonemia in
this study participant remain elusive. Biochemical data ruled out
diabetic ketoacidosis (glycemia remained below the range of acute
decompensation), and intercurrent illness, excessive alcohol intake
and intense exercise were also excluded.
Achievements of our medical nutritional therapy intervention
included a significant higher weight loss and improvement in
metabolic control. The weight loss effectiveness of our approach is
supported by the findings of 98 and 85% of our study subjects
achieving a 45% or 410% weight loss at the end of follow-up. Of
note, the 15% weight loss relative to baseline in subjects allocated
to the VLCK diet group in our study is larger than that reported in
the intensive lifestyle intervention arm of the Look Ahead trial.33
Furthermore, our medical nutritional therapy strategy resulted in
marked improvement of glycemic control. Our study design does
not allow disentangling of the relative effects of weight loss or
restricted carbohydrate intake.13 However, it is worth emphasizing
that the likelihood of achieving HbA1co7% was twofold in those
allocated to the VLCK diet group. This increased reduction of
HbA1c in the intervention group, could be explained by an
improvement in the insulin sensitivity as demonstrated by the
improvement in the HOMA-IR at the end of the study. In fact,
the VLCK diet induced a decrease in triglycerides, in line with the
improvement in glycemic control as plasma levels of triglycerides
is a biomarker of dysfunctional insulin sensitivity.30,34
Importantly, the metabolic beneficial effects occurred in the
absence of serious AEs. Moreover, the observed AEs associated
with VLCK diet were in line of those previously associated with
very-low carbohydrate interventions.35 Of note, only one patient
in the VLCK diet group discontinued the study because of an
AE with ketosis and 15.6% of the subjects in the VLCK diet group
presented early termination of the low-carbohydrate-ketogenic
diet period. Attrition rate in our study was similar to that
previously reported in VLCK diet, high-protein or very-low
carbohydrate diets.23,36,37 Moreover, the proportion of subjects
that deemed the intervention satisfactory was higher in subjects
in the VLCK diet group.
The short duration of our study is a limitation. However, the
main goal of the current study was to evaluate safety and
tolerability in subjects with T2DM of the phases in our method
with the largest energy- and carbohydrate-restriction along with
the higher proportion of calories as protein.
In summary, our study demonstrates the short-term feasibility,
safety, tolerability and efficacy of an interventional weight loss
program (Diaprokal Method) as medical nutritional therapy in
subjects with T2DM. This medical nutritional therapy intervention
resulted in significant weight loss in most study participants, along
with marked amelioration of glycemic control as compared with
a
