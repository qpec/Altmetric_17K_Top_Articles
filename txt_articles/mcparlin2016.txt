IMPORTANCE Nausea and vomiting affects approximately 85% of pregnant women. The most
severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum, affects up to 3% of women and can have significant
adverse physical and psychological sequelae.
OBJECTIVE To summarize current evidence on effective treatments for nausea and vomiting
in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum.
EVIDENCE REVIEW Databases were searched to June 8, 2016. Relevant websites and
bibliographies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were assessed independently by
2 reviewers. Results were narratively synthesized; planned meta-analysis was not possible
because of heterogeneity and incomplete reporting of findings.
FINDINGS Seventy-eight studies (n = 8930 participants) were included: 67 randomized
clinical trials (RCTs) and 11 nonrandomized studies. Evidence from 35 RCTs at low risk of bias
indicated that ginger, vitamin B6, antihistamines, metoclopramide (for mild symptoms),
pyridoxine-doxylamine, and ondansetron (for moderate symptoms) were associated with
improved symptoms compared with placebo. One RCT (n = 86) reported greater
improvements in moderate symptoms following psychotherapy (change in Rhodes score
[range, 0 {no symptoms} to 40 {worst possible symptoms}], 18.76 [SD, 5.48] to 7.06
[SD, 5.79] for intervention vs 19.18 [SD, 5.63] to 12.81 [SD, 6.88] for comparator [P < .001]).
For moderate-severe symptoms, 1 RCT (n = 60) suggested that pyridoxine-doxylamine
combination taken preemptively reduced risk of recurrence of moderate-severe symptoms
compared with treatment once symptoms begin (15.4% vs 39.1% [P < .04]). One RCT (n = 83)
found that ondansetron was associated with lower nausea scores on day 4 than
metoclopramide (mean visual analog scale [VAS] score, 4.1 [SD, 2.9] for ondansetron vs 5.7
[SD, 2.3] for metoclopramide [P = .023]) but not episodes of emesis (5.0 [SD, 3.1] vs 3.3 [SD, 3],
respectively [P = .013]). Although there was no difference in trend in nausea scores over the
14-day study period, trend in vomiting scores was better in the ondansetron group (P = .042).
One RCT (n = 159) found no difference between metoclopramide and promethazine after 24
hours (episodes of vomiting, 1 [IQR, 0-5] for metoclopramide vs 2 [IQR, 0-3] for promethazine
[P = .81], VAS [0-10 scale] for nausea, 2 [IQR, 1-5] vs 2 [IQR, 1-4], respectively [P = .99]). Three
RCTs compared corticosteroids with placebo or promethazine or metoclopramide in women
with severe symptoms. Improvements were seen in all corticosteroid groups, but only a
significant difference between corticosteroids vs metoclopramide was reported (emesis
reduction, 40.9% vs 16.5% at day 2; 71.6% vs 51.2% at day 3; 95.8% vs 76.6% at day 7 [n = 40,
P < .001]). For other interventions, evidence was limited.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For mild symptoms of nausea and emesis of pregnancy,
ginger, pyridoxine, antihistamines, and metoclopramide were associated with greater benefit
than placebo. For moderate symptoms, pyridoxine-doxylamine, promethazine, and
metoclopramide were associated with greater benefit than placebo. Ondansetron was
associated with improvement for a range of symptom severity. Corticosteroids may be
associated with benefit in severe cases. Overall the quality of evidence was low.

N
ausea and vomiting in pregnancy is a common but
debilitating condition affecting up to 85% of women.1
The most severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum, affects
0.3% to 3% of pregnant women and is characterized by intrac-
table vomiting, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, ketosis, nutri-
tional deficiencies, and weight loss.2 Symptoms usually start by 6
to 8 weeks’ gestation and subside before 20 weeks.1 In severe
cases, women may require prolonged hospitalization and support
from enteral or parenteral nutrition.
Symptoms can affect day-to-day functioning,3 ability to work,4
and interactions with offspring, family, and friends.5 A recent sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis reported an association between
hyperemesis gravidarum and preterm delivery and small-for-
gestational age infants, although there was no association with
congenital anomalies or perinatal death.6
This article reviews evidence regarding treatments for varying
severity of symptoms of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy or hy-
peremesis gravidarum.
Methods
We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL,
CDSR, DARE, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, PsycINFO, CAB
Abstracts, LILACS, AMED, Science Citation Index, Social Science
Citation Index, Scopus, Conference Proceedings Index–Science,
ClinicalTrials.gov, NHS-EED, HEED, China National Knowledge
Infrastructure) and key websites for randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) and nonrandomized comparative studies of pharmacologi-
cal or nonpharmacological interventions for nausea and vomiting
in pregnancy or hyperemesis gravidarum, without language restric-
tion, from inception to June 8, 2016, using terms describing
(1) nausea, vomiting, or hyperemesis gravidarum; (2) pregnancy
(see eBox 1 in the Supplement). We also searched for population-
based case series, for estimates of rare adverse events and fetal
outcomes, and for treatments reserved for the most severe cases
of hyperemesis gravidarum.
Titles and abstracts were assessed independently by 2 review-
ers (A.O., C.M.). The full text of each relevant article was reviewed
to further determine eligibility. Major exclusion criteria were stud-
ies with participants recruited after 20 weeks’ gestation and those
with no relevant outcomes reported (either via a validated scale or
author-defined scale; see Table 1). Discrepancies were resolved by
consultation with another reviewer (A.B.). Full-text articles pub-
lished in languages other than English were assessed by research-
trained native speakers working alongside the reviewers to ensure
consistency.
An electronic data form was used to compile abstracted infor-
mation.MethodologicalqualitywasassessedusingtheCochraneCol-
laboration’sRiskofBiastool15forRCTsandtheEffectivePublicHealth
PracticeProject(EPHPP)tool16fornonrandomizedstudies.Anevi-
dence grade (A-C) and recommendation (I-III) was assigned using
theAmericanHeartAssociation(AHA)scaleforeachtreatment(see
eBox 2 in the Supplement).17
Both fixed- or random- effects model meta-analysis and a
Bayesian mixed treatment comparison were planned as stipu-
lated in the protocol (PROSPERO CRD42013006642) but were
not performed because of heterogeneity in interventions, trial
populations, reporting, and definitions of outcome measures and
methods. Data were therefore summarized narratively and priori-
tized to emphasize the highest quality of evidence, defined as
randomized clinical trials with a low risk of bias.
Results
The search identified 13 075 titles, of which 222 underwent full
review. Seventy-eight studies (n = 8930 participants) met our
inclusion criteria (see eFigure in the Supplement). Of these, 11 RCTs
were classified as having high within-study risk of bias, mainly
attributable to allocation concealment bias, lack of blinding, incom-
plete outcome data, or selective outcome reporting. Twenty-one
were classified as being at unclear risk of bias, mainly because of
poor reporting and lack of methodological detail. The quality of
case series and nonrandomized studies was weak (n = 9) or moder-
ate (n = 2). The remaining 35 RCTs18-52 were at low risk of bias and
are presented below and summarized in eTables 1-3 in the
Supplement (details for all other included studies are summarized
in eTables 4-6 in the Supplement). Evidence grades and recom-
mendations are reported in Table 2.
Treatment
Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing serious
morbidity such as Wernicke encephalopathy, renal impairment, and
extreme weight loss.53-55 Treatments can be categorized into 3
broad yet overlapping groups. First-line treatments, including
simple lifestyle changes (such as eating small amounts often, avoid-
ing dietary triggers and strong odors, eating high-carbohydrate,
low-fat foods) and over-the-counter remedies, such as vitamin B6
(pyridoxine), ginger, and sea bands (an acupressure towelling wrist
band that stimulates the Pericardium P6 acupressure point), are
usually initiated by women when first experiencing symptoms.
Second-line treatments are typically prescribed when a woman
first presents to medical care, usually by her obstetric care provider,
and include a range of antiemetic drugs as well as provision of intra-
venous fluid and electrolyte replacement for women who are dehy-
drated and ketotic. Third-line treatments are reserved for women
Key Points
Question Which interventions are associated with improved
symptoms of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy or hyperemesis
gravidarum?
Findings In this systematic review, ginger, vitamin B6,
antihistamines, metoclopramide (mild symptoms), and
pyridoxine-doxylamine (moderate symptoms) were associated
with improved nausea and vomiting in pregnancy as compared
with placebo. Ondansetron was associated with symptom
improvement for all severity of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy
and hyperemesis gravidarum, and corticosteroids were associated
with beneficial effects in severe cases.
Meaning Both over-the-counter and prescription therapies are
associated with improved symptoms of nausea and vomiting in
pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum, although the evidence
supporting these therapies is generally of low quality.

with severe, persistent symptoms and are initiated in a hospital set-
ting. These include corticosteroids and supportive therapy, such as
enteral feeding. Depending on symptom severity, women may
progress from one category to another or may bypass first-line
treatments. When second- or third-line treatments fail, some
women opt for termination of pregnancy.56,57 An international
online survey carried out by the Hyperemesis Education and
Research Foundation reported that of 808 respondents, 15.2%
stated that they had undergone at least 1 pregnancy termination
for hyperemesis gravidarum.56
First-Line Treatments for Mild to Moderate Symptoms
Ginger | Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is available in several prep-
arations: powdered fresh root, tablets, capsules, and syrup. Its
antinausea properties were first described in traditional Chinese
medicine.58 Four RCTs compared ginger with placebo, and all
reported an improvement in symptoms from baseline compared
with placebo, regardless of the ginger dose and preparation.18-21
Basirat et al18 (n = 70) reported greater improvement in symptoms
on a visual analog scale (VAS) (participants specify their level of
symptom severity by indicating a position along a continuous line
between 0 [no symptoms] and 10 [worst possible symptoms]; see
Table 1). The ginger group changed from a mean of 5.88 (SD, 1.83)
at baseline to 3.03 (SD, 2.19) on day 4 compared with 4.67 (SD,
1.97) to 3.03 (SD, 2.47) for the placebo group (P = .01), but there
was no difference in episodes of vomiting. Fischer-Rasmussen et
al19 (n = 30) reported that mean nausea and vomiting relief score
(a complex score designed by the authors that takes into account
intensity of nausea, vomiting, weight loss, ketonuria, and hemato-
crit; range not provided), improved more for ginger compared with
placebo over two 5-day treatment periods (4.1 vs −0.1 and 3.7 vs
0.9 [P = .035]). Vutyavanich et al20 (n = 70) reported a greater
improvement in VAS scores for nausea (2.1 v 0.9, P = .014) and
vomiting episodes (1.4 v 0, P < .001) in the ginger group compared
with placebo. Similarly, Keating and Chez21 (n = 26) reported
greater improvements in VAS scores for nausea (10 women in the
ginger group had greater than a 4-point improvement compared
with 2 women in the placebo group by day 9), and a greater pro-
portion stopped vomiting in the ginger group (8 women in the
ginger group compared with 2 in the placebo group by day 6,
P value not reported).
Four RCTs compared ginger capsules and vitamin B6.22-25
Chittumma et al (n = 126)22 and Ensiyeh and Sakineh23 (n = 70)
reported greater improvements in nausea scores in women tak-
ing ginger capsules compared with vitamin B6 (Chittumma et al:
improvement in Rhodes score 3.3 vs 2.5, P < .05; Ensiyeh et al:
change in VAS scores, 2.2 v 0.9, P = .024). Smith et al24 (n = 291)
and Sripramote and Lekhyananda25 (n = 138) found no differ-
ences between the efficacy of ginger and vitamin B6. Sripramote
and Lekhyananda reported improvements in symptoms within
each group via VAS for nausea and episodes of vomiting but no
difference between groups.24,25 Similarly, Biswas et al26 (n = 78)
compared ginger with a doxylamine-pyridoxine combination and
reported symptom improvement within each group via VAS but
no difference between groups. Saberi et al27 (n = 159), reported
that ginger capsules compared with sea bands were associated
with a greater improvement in symptoms (Rhodes score
improvement, 8.61 for ginger and 4.17 for sea bands; P < .001).
In summary, treatment with ginger was associated with im-
provement in mild symptoms (level A, class IIa).
Acupressure, Acupuncture, and Nerve Stimulation | Acupressure
involves the application of physical pressure to specific acupunc-
ture points (eg, the Pericardium 6 [P6] point lies one-sixth of the
distance up the arm from the inner aspect of the wrist between
the 2 tendons; pressure at this point is believed to reduce symp-
toms of nausea and vomiting). Three RCTs compared acupressure
with placebo in women with mild symptoms.28-30 Bayreuther
et al28 (n = 23) and Belluomini et al29 (n = 60) reported improved
symptoms from baseline following acupressure at P6 compared
with pressure at an alternative location. Bayreuther et al reported
improvement in the VAS score for nausea (3.23 in the treatment
group, 4.92 in the placebo group [P = .019]). Belluomini et al
reported improvement in symptoms in both groups but only a
significant improvement for vomiting in the acupressure group
(change in Rhodes score from 2.09 [SD, 2.5] to 1.28 [SD, 1.9]
[P = .03] vs 1.83 [SD, 2.7] to 1.63 [SD, 2.3] [P not reported in the
placebo group]). Naemi-Rad et al30 (n = 80) reported reduced
symptoms of nausea and vomiting after 2 days when comparing
acupressure at acupoint Kidney 21 (KID21, a traditional Chinese
point on the upper abdomen, 6 cm above the umbilicus, 5 cm lat-
eral to the anterior midline) with nonstimulation (median VAS
scores for nausea intensity, 4 [interquartile range {IQR}, 2-5] for
the acupoint group and 7 [IQR, 5-8] for the comparator group
[P < .001]; mean scores for vomiting, 0 [IQR, 0-0.75] and 1 [IQR,
0-2], respectively [P < .001]).

7.66] vs 4.65 [95% CI, 3.67-5.63] [P = .02]).
Jamigorn and Phupong32 (n = 66) compared 5 days of treat-
ment with acupressure using sea bands plus placebo tablet vs
treatment with bands at nonstimulating position plus vitamin B6
(50 mg twice daily). Both were allowed to take dimenhydrinate
(50 mg every 6 hours as needed). Symptoms improved in each
group, with no difference in improvement between groups. Use of
dimenhydrinate was not different between the groups.
Three RCTs compared acupuncture with other treatments.33-35
A 4-group RCT conducted by Smith et al33 (n = 593) compared tra-
ditional acupuncture, P6 acupuncture, sham treatment, and an
information brochure. Women receiving traditional and P6 acu-
puncture had less nausea by the third week compared with women
in the sham treatment and information-only group (Rhodes Index

tional acupuncture group; 4.3 in the P6 acupuncture group; 4.4 in

No differences in vomiting scores were found between the groups
over the 3-week study period. A crossover trial by Carlsson et al34
(n = 33) reported a reduction in symptoms over time but no dif-
ference between P6 and sham acupuncture in nausea symptoms

after a 6-day treatment period.3 A similar outcome was found by
Knight et al35 (n = 56) (median final VAS score [range, 0 {no symp-
toms} to 100 {worst possible symptoms}] for nausea 3 days after
session 4, 47.5 [IQR, 29.25-69.5] for P6 acupuncture vs 48.0 [IQR,
14.0-80.0] for sham treatment).
In summary for acupressure: treatment with acupressure was
associated with symptom improvement for mild cases (level A,
class IIa).
Fornervestimulation:evidenceindicatestreatmentmaybecon-
sidered, but the benefit was unclear (level B, class IIb).
For acupuncture: the benefit was unclear (level A, class IIb).
Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) | Two RCTs examined the association of vi-
taminB6withimprovementinpeoplewithmildtomoderatesymp-
toms. Vutyavanich et al36 (n = 342) compared vitamin B6 (1 mg 3
times daily) with placebo. Vitamin B6 was associated with a greater
reduction in mean nausea VAS score from baseline compared with
aplacebotablet(2.9[SD,2.2]vs2.0[SD,2.7][P < .001]).Therewas
no difference in reported vomiting.36 When high- and low-dose vi-
tamin B6 (10 mg vs 1.28 mg daily) were compared in 60 women, a
greater change in Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and
Nausea (PUQE) score (3-question scale, scoring from 0 [no symp-
toms] to 15 [worst possible symptoms]; see Table 1) was reported
in the high-dose group (mean change, 3.86 [SD, 2.12] in the high-
dose group, 2.80 [SD, 1.78] in the low-dose group [P < .05]).37
In summary, treatment with vitamin B6 was associated with
symptom improvement for mild cases (level A, class IIa).
Second-Line Treatments for Moderate-Severe Symptoms
VitaminB6(Pyridoxine)/DoxylamineCombination|ThreeRCTscom-
pared pyridoxine-doxylamine combinations with either placebo or
ondansetron.Korenetal38(n = 280)comparedpyridoxine(10mg)
plusdoxylamine(10mg,slow-releasepreparation)withplaceboover
14 days. Symptoms improved in both groups, but the improve-
mentinthepyridoxine-doxylaminegroupwasgreater(meanchange
in PUQE score, 4.8 v 3.9; P = .006).
Oliveira et al39 (n = 36) compared pyridoxine-doxylamine
with ondansetron. Symptom improvement occurred in both
groups but was greater in the ondansetron group (median change
using a 0-100 VAS for nausea: 51 [IQR, 37-64] for ondansetron, 20
[IQR, 8-51] for pyridoxine-doxylamine [P = .019]; vomiting: 41
[IQR, 17-57] for ondansetron, 17 [IQR, 4-38] for pyridoxine-
doxylamine [P = .049]). Maltepe and Koren40 (n = 60) compared
preemptive treatment with pyridoxine-doxylamine vs treatment
once symptoms started. Moderate-severe symptoms were
reduced in the preemptive group (15.4%) compared with the post-
symptom group (39.1%) (P < .04).
In summary, treatment with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)–
doxylaminewasassociatedwithsymptomimprovementforwomen
with mild-moderate symptoms (level A, class IIa).
Erez et al41 (n = 150) compared hydroxyzine hydrochloride
(25 mg twice daily for 3 weeks) with placebo. Symptom improve-
ment occurred in the treatment group with partial or complete re-
liefofsymptomsin82%ofwomen,comparedwithonly22%inthe
placebo group (P < .01).
In summary, limited-quality evidence indicated that treatment
withantihistamineswasassociatedwithsymptomimprovementin
mild-moderate cases (level B, class IIa).
Psychotherapy|AnRCTbyFaramarzietal42(n = 86)comparedpsy-
chotherapytreatmentwithstandardcare.Allwomenreceived40mg
of vitamin B6 daily, and the treatment group received eight 50-
minute psychotherapy sessions over a 3-week period. A greater
change in the mean Rhodes score was seen in the treatment group
(18.76 [SD, 5.48] to 7.06 [SD, 5.79] vs 19.18 [SD, 5.63] to 12.81 [SD,
6.88], P < .001).
Insummaryforpsychotherapy:limitedevidenceindicatedthat
psychotherapy plus vitamin B6 was associated with greater benefit
than vitamin B6 alone (level B, class IIa,).
Dopamine Antagonists | Tan et al43 (n = 159) compared metoclo-
pramide (10 mg) with promethazine (25 mg) given intravenously 3
timesover24hours.Symptomsimprovedinbothtreatmentgroups,
with no difference between groups (episodes of vomiting, 1 [IQR,
0-5]formetoclopramidevs2[IQR,0-3]forpromethazine[P = .81],
VAS[0-10scale]fornausea,2[IQR,1-5]vs2[IQR,1-4],respectively
[P = .99]).
In summary, evidence indicated that treatment with dopa-
mine receptor antagonists was associated with improved symp-
toms (level A, class IIa).
Serotonin Antagonists (Ondansetron) | Two RCTs compared ondan-
setron with metoclopramide. Abas et al44 (n = 160) compared on-
dansetron(4mgintravenously)withmetoclopramide(10mgintra-
venously). Symptom improvement was seen in both groups, with
no evidence of difference between groups at 24 hours. However,
more women in the metoclopramide group reported adverse ef-
fects (drowsiness: 12.5% for ondansetron vs 30% for metoclo-
pramide [P = .011]; dry mouth: 10% for ondansetron vs 23.8% for
metoclopramide (P = .03). Kashifard et al45 (n = 83) compared on-
dansetronwithmetoclopramideover2weeks.Ondansetronwasas-
sociated with lower nausea scores on day 4 than metoclopramide
(meanvisualanalogscale[VAS]score,4.1[SD,2.9]forondansetron
vs 5.7 [SD, 2.3] for metoclopramide [P = .023]) but not episodes of
emesis (5.0 [SD, 3.1] vs 3.3 [SD, 3], respectively [P = .013]). The on-
dansetron group had lower vomiting scores than the metoclo-
pramide group calculated over 14 days (P = .042, raw data not pro-
vided), but there was no difference in trend in nausea scores over
14 days between groups.
Insummary,treatmentwithserotoninreceptorantagonistswas

Intravenous Fluids | Tan et al46 (n = 222) compared different com-
positions of intravenous solution. The intervention group received
intravenousdextrosesalinewithantiemeticsaccordingtohealthcare
provider preference, whereas the comparator group received nor-
mal saline with antiemetics. Repeated-measures analysis of vari-
ance of nausea score found greater improvements in the dextrose
saline group relative to the saline group (P = .046), but no differ-
ence in vomiting was reported.

be associated with better improvements than normal saline in

(n = 53) reported no difference in symptom severity over 7 days
between women who received outpatient rehydration and an
antiemetic (cyclizine, 50 mg intravenous/oral) vs inpatient care.
McCarthy et al48 (n = 98) also compared outpatient with inpa-
tient care. The median number of nights spent in the hospital was
lower in the outpatient group (0 [IQR, 0-2] vs 2 [IQR, 1-4] nights,
P < .001).
Insummary,evidenceindicatedthatoutpatienttreatmentwas
associated with benefits that are not better or worse than inpa-
tientintravenoustherapyinpatientswithmoderatesymptoms(level
A, class IIa).
Third-Line Treatments for Moderate-Severe Symptoms
Corticosteroids | Three RCTs compared corticosteroids with pla-
cebo or other treatments. Nelson-Piercy et al49 (n = 40) com-
pared prednisolone with placebo. There was no difference in vom-
itingandnauseascoresinthesteroidgroupcomparedwithplacebo.
Safari et al50 (n = 40) compared methylprednisolone with pro-
methazine. There was no difference in symptom improvement by 1
week. However, no patients from the methylprednisolone group
were readmitted for recurrence of vomiting, compared with 5 pa-
tients from the promethazine group (P < .01).
Bondok et al51 (n = 40) compared hydrocortisone with meto-
clopramide. Steroids were associated with a greater reduction in
vomiting episodes compared with metoclopramide (emesis reduc-
tion, 40.9% vs 16.5% at day 2; 71.6% vs 51.2% at day 3; 95.8% vs
76.6% at day 7 [n = 40, P < .001]).
In summary, evidence indicated that benefits of corticoste-
roids were unclear. Treatment may be considered in severe cases
(level A, class IIb)
Transdermal Clonidine | Transdermal clonidine patches were investi-
gated in 1 randomized crossover trial by Maina et al52 (n = 12) in pa-
tients unresponsive to other antiemetics. Either clonidine or placebo
patcheswerewornfor5daysbeforethetreatmentwasalternated.In-
travenous fluids and rescue antiemetics were given as required. The
meanimprovementinsymptomscoreswasgreaterforclonidinetreat-
ment (mean PUQE score, 6.3 [95% CI, 5.5-7.1] for clonidine and 8.5
[95% CI, 7.7-9.3] for placebo, P = .001), and there was less use of an-
tiemetics and intravenous therapy in the clonidine group.
In summary, limited evidence indicated treatment with trans-
dermalclonidinewasassociatedwithsymptomimprovements,but
currently this is not an established treatment for nausea and vom-
iting in pregnancy in clinical practice (level B, class IIb).

Discussion
The review found low-quality evidence for therapies treating nau-
sea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum. Less
than half of all studies were judged as being at low risk of bias.
Ginger,acupressure,andvitaminB6areappropriateinitialover-
the-counter therapies for mild symptoms. Treatment with nerve
stimulation may be considered, but, as with acupuncture, the ben-
efit is unclear.
When symptoms are mild-moderate, or if the above over-the-
countertherapieswerenotbeneficial,antihistamines(aloneorcom-
bined with vitamin B6) were associated with improved symptoms
compared with placebo. Limited evidence indicated an association
between psychotherapy, metoclopramide, and promethazine and
improvements in moderate symptoms. There was no evidence to
indicate that these treatments are unsafe, but more research is
needed.
Whensymptomsaremoderate-severe,outpatient,day-careman-
agement is feasible, acceptable, and does not result in worse out-
comescomparedwithinpatientcare.Theserotoninreceptorantago-
nist ondansetron improves symptoms at all severities, but benefit
comparedwithmetoclopramideorantihistaminesisunclear.Ondan-
setronappearstobesafeinpregnancy,59butevidenceislimitedand
more research is needed. Large doses of intravenous ondansetron
(morethan8mgin1intravenousdose)arecontraindicatedinwomen
at risk of cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation). In such circum-
stances, an electrocardiogram should be performed and electrolyte
levelscheckedpriortotreatment.60Thereisnoevidencethatoralad-
ministration of ondansetron causes QT prolongation in adults.10
When symptoms are more severe or persistent, corticoste-
roids are associated with improved symptom severity and may be
more beneficial than metoclopramide and promethazine. How-
ever,useisgenerallylimitedtowomenwithsevereintractablesymp-
toms with prior treatment failure, preferably after 10 weeks’ gesta-
tion and during an inpatient admission. This arises from concerns
regarding a small increase in incident oral clefts in fetuses exposed
to corticosteroids in utero in pooled data from observational
studies.61Moreevidenceisneededcomparingcorticosteroidswith
other medications.
Comparison With Previous Literature
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists pub-
lishedclinicalmanagementguidelinesinAugust2015,2recommend-
ing the use of vitamin B6 or vitamin B6 plus doxylamine as first-line
pharmacotherapy,gingerasanonpharmacologicaloption,andmeth-
ylprednisoloneinrefractorycases.Recommendationsbasedoncon-
sensus include intravenous hydration and enteral tube feeding for
womenwhoarenotresponsivetomedicaltherapy.Manyofthefind-
ingsinthisreviewsupportrecommendationsintheguidelines.How-
ever,althoughpyridoxineplusdoxylaminewasmoreeffectivethan
placebo, there is no substantial evidence to suggest that the com-
bination is more effective than other antiemetics such as antihista-
mines. Moreover, this review adds value by categorizing therapies
depending on symptom severity. Two Cochrane reviews were pub-
lished recently.62,63 Matthews et al62 included only RCTs focusing
on nausea and vomiting and excluded trials involving hyperemesis
gravidarum; the review by Boelig et al63 only included RCTs of hy-
peremesis gravidarum. Neither review categorized therapies de-
pendingonsymptomseverity.However,bothreviewswereconsis-
tentinconcludingthatthereislittlegood-qualityevidencetosupport
any available intervention.
Limitations
These recommendations are limited by the quality and heteroge-
neity of evidence. Quality was downgraded due to clinical hetero-
geneity, imprecision, sparseness of data, or a combination of these
factors. There was also considerable variation in the initial assess-
ment and subsequent reporting of nausea, vomiting, and other rel-
evant outcomes in the identified studies. As a result, we were un-
abletoconducttheplannedmeta-analysisstipulatedinouroriginal
protocol.
