Advances in the diagnosis and treatment
of multiple myeloma have come at a rapid
pace, especially with several new drugs
entering the market in the last few years.
However, access to and affordability of
new treatments poses a major challenge,
both in the United States and around the
world. High costs of life-saving drugs are
detrimental to both the personal finances
of the individual patient, as well as society
which must bear the increasing costs in
terms of increased health insurance pre-
miums, taxes, or both. The challenges are
not unique to myeloma, but are commonly
encountered in several other cancers as
well. But to some extent these pharma-
coeconomic concerns are amplified in
myeloma due to the need for multidrug
regimens that combine 2 or more expen-
sive new drugs, continuous therapy, and
the prolonged disease course in most
patients. We examine current myeloma
therapy from a pharmacoeconomic per-
spective, and discuss the costs involved.
We outline the underlying reasons why
cancer drugs are so expensive, the mea-
sures that are required to lower cost, and
propose potential ways in which costs can
be reduced while still delivering high-quality
care. (Blood. 2016;128(24):2757-2764)
Introduction
There have been major advances in the last 15 years in the diagnosis and
treatment of multiple myeloma.1,2 Overall survival has improved
remarkably during this period driven by discovery of several new active
drugs. However, as in every other malignancy, new drugs come with a
hefty price tag: almost every approved cancer drug in the last few years
costs more than $100 000 per year in the United States, and myeloma
treatments are no exception.3,4 Even the price of old drugs such as
melphalan has increased greatly over time. The problem of cost and
affordabilityisamplifiedinmyelomain3ways.First,thediseaserequires
multidrug combinations, increasing the already expensive cost of care to
unsustainable levels.5,6 Second, treatments are usually continued until
progression in the form of “continuous therapy” or “maintenance
therapy,” ensuring that high costs are not a temporary problem but rather
anunrelentingdilemmaforthepatient.7,8Third,assurvivalhasimproved
markedly (median of .7-10 years for standard-risk patients), the
cumulative costs of care over the lifetime of a patient are exorbitant.9
The high cost of cancer care not only impacts the patient directly
but alsohas an impact on societyin the form of rising premiums, taxes,
orboth. In manycountries,high costs limit accesstoeffective drugs,as
neither the health care system nor the individual patient can afford
these costs without cutting back on other essential needs.10-12 In this
Perspective, we outline the current state of myeloma therapy and
discuss the costs involved. We summarize the primary reasons why
cancer drugs are soexpensive,and listsome measures that are required
to lower cost. We also propose potential ways in which costs can be
reduced in myeloma while still delivering high-quality care, and
provide recommendations for strategic clinical trials.
Modern therapy of myeloma
The treatment of myeloma varies across the world depending on
many factors, including access to new drugs and resources, cost
constraints, and treatment philosophy. The general approach to
therapy (Figure 1) is summarized in the following sections, and is
essential to the discussion on cost and strategies to deliver cost-
effective care.13 Importantly, the approach outlined is fairly
uniform across the world, but the availability of new drugs may
reduce the number of options in many parts of the world. Major
advances are summarized in Table 1.14-26
Initial therapy
Patients who are candidates for ASCT are treated with induction
therapy forapproximately3 to4 cycleswitha tripletregimenconsisting
of bortezomib and dexamethasone combined with either lenalidomide
(VRD),thalidomide (VTD),orcyclophosphamide (VCD),followed by
stem cell harvest.13 After harvest, patients proceed to ASCT, followed
by maintenance therapy for at least 1 to 2 years. Selected patients with
standard-risk myeloma may defer ASCT until first relapse.27-29 The use
of maintenance varies across countries based on drug approval and
availability. Generally, lenalidomide is the drug of choice for
maintenance,16,17 although some experts prefer bortezomib-based
maintenance for patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease.30
PatientswhoarenotcandidatesforASCTaretreatedwitheitheratriplet
regimen for 12 to 18 months or alternatively with Rd until progres-
sion.31 The choice of the triplet regimen varies, but in general
melphalan-based regimens are being replaced by newer regimens such
as such as VRD or VCD.
Treatment of relapsed myeloma
Almost all patients with myeloma relapse after initial therapy, at a
median duration of 4 years after ASCT plus maintenance, or ;2.5
years without ASCT.15,31 The disease is then characterized by
multiple relapses and remissions, with the number of remissions
dependent on the available treatment options. In the last 5 years,
several new drugs have been introduced into clinical practice greatly

 expanding treatment options. These include carfilzomib,19 pomali-
domide,20 panobinostat,21 elotuzumab,22 daratumumab,23,24,32 and
ixazomib.25 All of these drugs have secured the approval of the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are available in the United
States. However, the availability of these drugs in other countries is
varied depending on the regulatory approval status. In general, due to
regulatory and/or economic reasons, most of these drugs have
limited availability in many parts of the world. Nevertheless, the
availability of multiple active drugs has resulted in numerous
combinations that can be used to treat relapsed disease. A patient
refractory to 1 regimen may respond to another.
The choice of a treatment regimen at relapse is complex. The main
factors that influence the selection of a specific regimen depend on
whether the relapse occurs on or off therapy, the type, nature of re-
sponse, and tolerability of the prior regimen, number of prior lines of
therapy, aggressiveness of the relapse, and the physical condition of the
patient.33Theseconsiderationsaretakenintoaccountateachrelapse.In
patients who are fit, it may be possible to try numerous regimens
sequentially.
Cost considerations
Current diagnosis and treatment of myeloma is expensive, not just due
tothecostofspecificnewdrugsbutduetoseveralfactorsthatplayarole
in diagnosis, staging, management, and monitoring.
Diagnostic and monitoring costs
Bone disease is the main cause of morbidity in myeloma, and accurate
detection is critical for diagnosis and assessment of response. Although
bone involvement can be detected on routine skeletal radiographs,
we increasingly need whole-body low-dose computed tomography,
magnetic resonance imaging, or fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emis-
sion tomography/computed tomography scans to evaluate disease at
multiple points during the disease course.1,34,35 Not all new imaging
tools are needed at the same time for each patient, and guidelines
on optimal use have been proposed by the International Myeloma
Working Group (IMWG).35 Nevertheless, these are expensive imaging
modalities that add to the cost of care. Similarly, the costs of standard
bone marrow examination in myeloma have risen considerably due
to the need for studies such as fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH) that are required for molecular classification and risk
stratification.36,37FISHstudiesareneededtoidentifypatientswhohave
high-risk cytogenetic features such as gain(1q), del(1p), del(17p), and
translocations t(14;16), t(4;14), and t(14;20).38-41 The Revised Inter-
national Staging System (RISS) for myeloma requires assessment of
myelomacytogenetics by FISH or equivalent method.42 The successof
myeloma therapies has enabled the achievement of deep responses,
prompting the development of methods to detect minimal residual
disease such as next-generation molecular sequencing and next-
generation flow cytometry.43 Clearly, advances in bone imaging and
accurate molecular cytogenetic risk stratification provide clinical
benefit and are needed for the optimal management of myeloma. We

From 
 how the costs of new drugs are not the only economic issue of concern
to myeloma patients. In some countries where the cost of care is borne
directly by the patient (out-of-pocket care), it is likely that compromises
occur and some essential tests are omitted. Even in countries with third-
party payment systems, the extent and nature of testing may be re-
stricted based on what can be reimbursed.44
Cost implications of current therapy
The modern treatment of myeloma discussed earlier is expensive. The
standard triplet combination of VRD can cost more than $150 000 per
year (US dollars; all costs estimated from www.goodrx.com).45 Four
cyclesofVRDfollowedbyASCTisnodifferent.Onceinitialtherapyis
completed, at current market prices in the United States, maintenance
therapywithlenalidomidewillcostapproximately$100 000peryear.46
In patients undergoing ASCT, the median time to progression
following induction, transplantation, and maintenance is ;4 years; this
equates to an overall cost of initial therapy in excess of $500 000. But
this is onlythe beginning: the rapid progressover the last decade means
that physicians have at their disposal several different classes of agents
to treat patients with relapsed disease: alkylators (cyclophosphamide,
melphalan), new proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib),
new immunomodulatory drugs (pomalidomide), deacetylase inhibitors
(panobinostat), and monoclonal antibodies (elotuzumab and daratu-
mumab). These agents can be combined into various triplet regi-
mens, and used sequentially for the treatment of relapse.47 Modern
regimens that contain newly approved agents such as daratumumab or
carfilzomib can cost in excess of $200 000 per year. These estimates
do not include several other ancillary expenses associated with modern
therapy: long-term IV bisphosphonates, anticoagulants, prophylactic
antibiotics, and antivirals, treatment of drug-induced neuropathy, man-
agement of infusion reactions, etc.
These costs will disproportionately affect underinsured and
uninsured patients. They also affect patients in many countries where
government run health care plans cannot sustain such high costs,
leading to rationing of care or in some cases outright denial of
coverage.12 Patients in countries where the costs of medical care are
predominantly out-of-pocket probably face a grim choice between life
and financial ruin.48 Even the well-insured are not immune to these
costs. They may be impacted by high copays or denial of coverage.
Furthermore, although insurers (or governments) may pick up the bulk
of the cost, society still pays in the form of increased premiums and
taxes.3
Impending increases in costs with newer regimens
As bad as the financial costs of modern myeloma treatment are, they
pale in comparison with what we anticipate in the near future.
For example, trials are evaluating the promise of KRD as initial
therapy; this regimen is ;1.5 to 2 times more expensive than
VRD.46,49 But more important in terms of cost is the likely addition
of daratumumab, a highly active monoclonal antibody to various
triplet regimens currently in use for the treatment of myeloma to
create quadruplets that could cost in excess of $300 000 per year.45
But there is more: several other promising agents have shown single-
agent activity in myeloma and will likely be approved for the
treatment of the disease in the future.26 These include: isatuximab, a
CD38 monoclonal antibody; marizomib, a new proteasome in-
hibitor; oprozomib, an oral proteasome inhibitor related to
carfilzomib; filanesib, a kinesin spindle protein inhibitor; dinaciclib,
a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; venetoclax, a selective B-cell
lymphoma 2 inhibitor; and LGH-447, a pan proto-oncogene serine/
threonine-protein kinase inhibitor (Table 1). Once approved, these
new drugs will greatly increase the number of rational combinations
that are possible, as well as the inevitable associated costs. This is
unsustainable.
We do not lament the advances that have occurred in myeloma.
We welcome and embrace them. They have changed the face of
myeloma, and brought hope and even the prospect of cure to
myeloma patients. However, we also recognize that, at current
costs, these advances will be a reality only to a small proportion of
well-insured, affluent patients with the disease. The vast majority of
myeloma patients may not be able to avail of these advances
because it is unlikely that either government-funded health care
programs or individual patients will be able to afford the best of
what we experts can design to treat the disease.45,50 Even more
unfortunate is the fact that many myeloma patients in many parts of
the world will not even be aware of the spectacular results that are
possible with modern myeloma therapy, let alone have access to
them.
Reasons for high cost of cancer drugs
The high cost of drugs to treat myeloma is reflective of a bigger
problem that involves almost all new oncology drugs.51-53 Why are
cancer drugs so expensive? And, what can we do about it? The high
cost of cancer drugs is related to numerous factors. These factors
are present in other disease settings as well but are amplified
considerably in cancer (Table 2). First, it is expensive to move
findings from bench to bedside in cancer, and perform all the
regulatory studies needed to gain regulatory approval.54 Many
drugs fail, due to the very nature of advanced cancer. Pharmaceu-
tical companies attempt to regain investment by adding costs of
development of both successful and unsuccessful products on the
newly approved drug. Second, because most cancers such as
myeloma are not curable, patients need to be treated with each
approved agent (sequentially or in combination). For example, the

From 
 fact that there are several active myeloma drugs does not mean that a
patient does not need to try daratumumab at some point in the disease
course. This in effect makes each drug a virtual monopoly.51 Third,
even as the monopoly ends as patents expire, “new and improved”
versions of an approved drug appear on the market. At this time, the
older drug tends to be viewed as substandard treatment thereby
perpetuating the situation. In myeloma, there is now a pressure to
consider newer proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib) in
favor of bortezomib.49 Although there is a role for these newer drugs,
there are no good data indicating that trying them after bortezomib
fails would be any less effective. But with poorly designed trials it is
possible to create an aura that the older drug is inferior. Fourth, a
diagnosis of cancer carries grave consequences and patients often
want to try every potentially useful drug, even if they are expensive
and provide only marginal improvements in outcome. More
importantly, in most developed countries including the United
States, patients are not the primary payers for the drug. This makes
high prices easier to sustain in the pharmaceutical sector compared
with other economic sectors where the “client” has to make a choice
to buy or not based on affordability.53 Finally, systems in the United
States provide an incentive to administer more expensive chemo-
therapy and to keep prices high.55 This includes policies that allow
higher reimbursement when more expensive drugs are administered,
legal barriers preventing the FDA from taking economic and cost-
effectiveness considerations into account when approving new
drugs, laws that prevent the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) from being able to negotiate the price of new drugs,
and prohibition of importation of drugs for personal use.50,52,56
Attempts to change any of these policies are met with aggressive
resistance not only from pharmaceutical companies (which is to be
expected) but from many other quarters including professional and
patient support organizations all of whom have significant financial
conflicts of interest. In short, there are few allies in the fight to lower
drug prices.
Reducing cost of cancer drugs
Value-based reimbursement and pricing
In many European countries, Canada, and Australia, regulatory
approval is only the first step. The price of the drug is then subject to
negotiation based on the value it provides.57,58 The value may be
estimated by using strict criteria to determine the clinical added value
compared with existing drugs. But in many countries, the value is
definedeitherexclusivelyorpartlybydefiningtheefficiencyofthedrug
(cost-results analysis). The value estimate is typically done by
calculating the quality adjusted life year gained with the new treatment,
and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).51 Thresholds are
used in some countries such as the United Kingdom to decide access to
market, but this carries the risk of drug restrictions. Elsewhere, the
ICER is used for price negotiations. There is no consensus regarding
ICER thresholds. The World Health Organization (WHO) has
arbitrarily defined 3 times gross domestic product per capita as a
reasonable ICER.59 At the price proposed by pharmaceutical
companies, the ICER of all new myeloma treatments is far beyond
this level. In the United States, there is no system to define fair price.
The FDA approves drugs based on evidence of clinical benefit and
safety. The magnitude of benefit is not taken into account to determine
price.12 Thus, drugs that improve survival by only a few days or weeks
canbepricedatthesamelevelasonesthatprovideamuchlargerdegree
of benefit. The United States needs laws that would allow value-based
pricing.
The added value of a new drug should be the same in all countries if
the comparator is the same. Therefore, methods for evaluating this
added value should be the same and joint international assessments
should be developed. Consensus regarding an acceptable ICER should
be organized at least in countries with comparable gross domestic
product. In the United States, organizations like the Patient-Centered
OutcomesResearchInstitute(PCORI)shouldbeauthorizedtotakecost
Table 2. Reasons for high cost of cancer drugs and possible solutions
Reasons and solutions
Why are cancer drugs so expensive?
• High cost of drug development
• Existence of virtual monopoly; lack of free market competition
• Sustaining monopoly with “new and improved” versions of a drug as patents expire
• Willingness of patients to pay high costs even for marginal improvements in outcome due to the seriousness of the diagnosis
• Higher reimbursement to providers when more expensive drugs are administered
• Legal barriers that prevent the FDA from taking economic and cost-effectiveness considerations into account when approving new drugs
• Laws that prevent CMS from being able to negotiate the price of new drugs
• Prohibition of importation of drugs for personal use
• Resistance to change in policies from pharmaceutical companies and from professional and patient support organizations who receive financial support from
pharmaceutical companies
What can we do about it?
Value-based reimbursement and pricing
• FDA, CMS, or other agency should be able to negotiate the sale price based on the incremental value provided by the drug as is done by health authorities in Canada
and Europe
• PCORI should be authorized to allow cost-effectiveness as a metric to compare relative value of treatments
• Support organizations such as Institute for Clinical and Economic Review which evaluate the cost -effectiveness and affordability of new treatments
Negotiation of prices and formulary control
• CMS should be authorized to negotiate cost and have formulary control
• Strong advocacy and a patient-driven grass-roots movement for the required changes in federal law
Increase market competition
• Allow importation of drugs for personal use
• Facilitate easier approval of generics
• Selectively invoke compulsory licensing provisions

From 
 into account when evaluating treatments.60 Currently, the PCORI,
created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010
(PPACA), is specifically prohibited from using cost-effectiveness
measures in funding comparative effectiveness studies or in its
recommendations.61,62 We also need to support private nonprofit
organizations like the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review and
other endeavors like DrugAbacus in their attempts to shine a spotlight
on cost and value, as is done by health technology assessment insti-
tutions in Europe and other countries.60,63
One argument against value-based pricing is that these measures
will stifle innovation, and that they run counter to free-market
principles. This argument cannot be farther from the truth.12,52 In fact,
the current system in the United States allows a new drug to be marketed
at a very high cost regardless of the value it provides. Thus, there is
actually a disincentive for innovation. It is far safer and more lucrative to
develop a “me-too” drug that is likely to succeed in a regulatory trial
than take the risk and develop a truly innovative product. Further-
more, the pricing of cancer drugs, unlike other commodities, is not
representative of a “free-market” system.The checks and balances that
make the free-market system work efficiently in other areas are absent
in the oncology marketplace due to the monopolistic nature of new
drugs, and the existence of laws that prevent standard free-market
principles such as the inability to negotiate for low prices, the pro-
hibition on importation, and the reimbursement model which involves
third-party payers.
Improved national guidelines
Many cancer guidelines present a list of all possible or acceptable
treatmentoptionsandprimarilyservetoensurethatpatientshaveaccess
to treatments that are felt to be effective for purposes of access or
insurance coverage. Many guidelines include authors who have
significant financial conflicts of interest.64 These guidelines seldom
provide recommendations on how to provide the most cost-effective
care. We need evidence-based guidelines that critically examine the
available data, and provide clear recommendations not only on which
regimens are preferred, but also on identifying regimens that should be
avoided in a given setting if they lack adequate data on superiority
compared with less expensive alternatives.45
Negotiation of prices and formulary control
At present, the CMS is prevented by law from negotiating directly for
the cost of cancer drugs administered through the Medicare Part D
program.3 This law, passed by the US Congress in November 2003 in
the dead of the night, required the CMS to purchase and provide
prescription drugs to beneficiaries nationwide, while at the same
time inexplicably prohibited it from being able to negotiate with
pharmaceutical companies on the purchase cost of these drugs.65,66
This, as expected, set up a situation ripe for annual price increases.
Essentially,pharmaceuticalcompaniescouldnametheirpriceandtagon
year-after-year price increases.50,67 As long as it was not an egregious
increase as occurred with Daraprim (Turing Pharmaceuticals) or EpiPen
(Mylan), no one noticed.68,69 This needs to change. The single most
important thing that we need to reduce cost is to authorize CMS to
negotiate cost and have the ability to deny formulary addition if the cost
is felt to be unacceptable. This will make the system in the United States
similar to Europe and Canada. Importantly, it will eliminate the safety
valve that pharmaceutical companies have which affects the cost of
drugs around the world. The fact that prices can be increased in the
United States to compensate any potential loss of market share probably
enables pharmaceutical companies to walk away from price negotia-
tions with smaller countries in Europe and elsewhere. This requires a
major change in existing law and will not be possible without strong
advocacy and a patient-driven grass-roots movement.3 In Europe, prices
are negotiated at the national level,usually on the basis of the price in the
United States, and different forms of rebates are proposed. However, the
huge budget impact of recently introduced new drugs and drug
combinations pushes payers to develop new ways for payment such as
performance-based risk-sharing agreements where payments are linked
to the actual results.
We alsoneedtosupport recent effortsbythe CMStotest indication-
based pricing and fixed reimbursement amounts for closely related
drugs in a given class.55,70 If the price of a drug is related to its added
value, it should be lower in indications where the benefit for the patient
is less evident. Currently, the price is the same for all indications
whatever the results and the duration of treatment. There needs to be a
renegotiation of the price in relation to the increased number of treated
patients when new indications are authorized. Another possible
solution might be to pay not for drugs but for the global treatment of
a disease at a given stage.
Increase market competition
Several measures can be adopted to increase market competition which
willresultinlowercoststhesamewayitworkswithothercommodities.
One approach to increase market competition is to allow importation of
drugs from other countries for personal use.3 A second approach would
be to make the approval of generics easier, and have international
agreements that allow generics approved in selected countries auto-
matic access to domestic markets.71 Any concern about the quality of
generics made by reputable companies is misguided, and will be in any
case miniscule compared with the alternative of having large chunks of
the affected population without access to effective drugs because of
pharmacoeconomic reasons. We should also enact laws that prevent
major pharmaceutical companies from engaging in a “pay-for-delay”
strategy to delay the launch of a generic drug. A third approach would
be for countries to invoke compulsory licensing provisions that are
permitted under the Doha declaration of 2001.72 This mechanism in the
interest of public health allows a country that is not able to negotiate a
reasonable price to grant a license to a low-cost generic company to
manufacture a life-saving drug that is still under patent protection for
use within that particular country.
New modalities for drug development
Current drug clinical development usually involves phase 1 and 2
studies followed by large randomized phase 3 trials. When the mode of
action or the target of a new drug iswell defined in preclinical studies, it
may be possible to more rapidly obtain proof-of-concept and positive
results in selected groups of patients. Approval by the regulators
might be decided sooner (so-called “adaptive licensing “or adaptive
pathway”).73,74 It necessitates new rules for approval with less clinical
data, and requires postmarketing confirmatory studies.
Strategies to reduce costs of myeloma
treatment in clinical practice
The solutions for high cost of cancer drugs, including those used totreat
myeloma, appear difficult to achieve in a timely manner. What can be
done in the meantime? Can we deliver cost-effective care without
sacrificing efficacy in situations where access to the treatments outlined
in Figure 1 is not feasible? For example, VRD has shown an overall
survival benefit over Rd in newly diagnosed myeloma.14 However, it is

From 
 an expensive regimen out of reach in many countries due to economic
and regulatory issues. Comparative data on less expensive triplets such
as VCD or VTD that can be used in place of VRD are not available
(Figure 2A). The absence of such data does not automatically indicate
these regimens are inferior to VRD. In fact, for purposes of initial
therapy, they may have similar activity, and would be reasonable
alternatives to VRD for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma.
Similarly, data are limited on the duration of posttransplant
lenalidomide maintenance in myeloma. Randomized studies show that
lenalidomide significantly prolongs progression-free survival; overall
survival results are lessclear and the optimal duration of maintenance is
unknown.16,17 In our opinion, it might be cost-effective to administer
lenalidomide for a limited duration of time (1-2 years). There are many
limitations to the randomized trials of lenalidomide maintenance to
determine appropriate duration of therapy, and outcome appears
excellent in a recent randomized trial that administered maintenance for
1 year.15 Thus,if the costs of indefinite maintenance are prohibitive and
not possible in clinical practice, an approach of limited duration of
therapy is a reasonable alternative to not administering any posttrans-
plant treatment.
In relapsed myeloma, where newer drugs are either unaffordable or
unavailable, it is still possible to deliver effective salvage therapy
and keep the disease in control for many years. This includes use of
less expensive combinations such as VCD, VTD, or a second
ASCT. Among the new regimens, using DRD may provide the most
prolonged duration of remission and may be more cost-effective in the
long run (Figure 2B).75 There are no data that the sequence in which
regimens are administered matters in terms of overall survival. Thus,
using less expensive regimens early in the disease course would be
more cost-effective because the duration of therapy decreases with each
relapse. Furthermore, over time, the cost of regimens may decrease as
some drugs go off patent and generics emerge, or competitors with the
same mechanism of action emerge putting price pressure.
We recognize these are less than ideal stop-gap recommendations.
The IMWG is in the process of analyzing available data and is
developing guidelines and pathways that take cost into account. We
strongly feel that as drugs become generic, we should demand greater
standards of evidence in order for more expensive brand-name versions
to be adopted.45 For example, as bortezomib becomes generic, there are
littledata from well-executed trials that administering a more expensive
proteasome inhibitor first will produce better survival. We should
demand such data rather than small trials that purportedly show
improvement in surrogate end points.
Strategies for value-oriented clinical trials
We need to focus our clinical trial efforts on identifying ways in which
to provide the most cost-effective care and those that address strategic
questions. When designing a clinical trial comparing 2 therapeutic
strategies, investigators should address the question of efficiency (cost-
effectiveness) as secondary objective. A recent paper has outlined
several high-priority trials that need to be conducted in myeloma to
determine treatment approaches that provide the best value.45 These

From 
 types of trials are seldom pursued by pharmaceutical companies and
need significant funding. We understand that due to the rapid pace of
advancesmanyrecentrandomizedtrialshavebeenconductedprimarily
for regulatory approval of new drugs. These are valuable in terms of
making new treatments available, but are clearly not designed to
provide answers to strategic questions.
First, we need trials that can identify drugs that work well in each
subtype,butmoreimportantlyfromacoststandpointwealsoneedtrials
that can identify drugs that are unlikely to work in a given cytogenetic
subtype.Second,we needto determine whether an equivalentdegree of
survival benefit can be obtained with a short course of therapy (similar
to that used in diffuse large cell lymphoma) compared with the current
approach prolonged therapy for many years. We already know that
;15% of patients with newly diagnosed myeloma can do extraordi-
narilywellforaprolongedperiodoftimewithjustRdorRdplusASCT.
Itislikelythatwithsomemoderncombinationswecanidentifyasubset
of patients who can do well for many years following ;1 year of initial
therapy. The point is that we will never find out the answer if we do not
embark on trials testing this approach. Third, we need to determine
whether we can adjust therapy based on response, so that patients who
have achieved an minimal residual disease–negative state can safely
stop therapy, thereby providing improved value and quality of life.
Clearly, these are exciting times for myeloma, and the hopes of our
patients for long-term survival and possible cure depend on our ability
to translate current advances into realistic treatments that can be
delivered to patients worldwide. The major barrier is economic, and we
should do everything we can to make affordable care for myeloma
happen, by providing solutions to lower cost of life-saving drugs, by
adaptingtreatmentpathwaysthatprovidethemostcost-effectivecarein
our practice, and through cleverly designed clinical trials.
