Abstract
Tobacco smoke exposure has been associated with risk of
childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Understanding
the relationship between tobacco exposures and specific muta-
tions may yield etiologic insights. We carried out a case-only
analysis to explore whether prenatal and early-life tobacco smoke
exposure influences the formation of leukemogenic genomic
deletions. Somatic copy number of 8 genes frequently deleted
in ALL (CDKN2A, ETV6, IKZF1, PAX5, RB1, BTG1, PAR1 region,
and EBF1) was assessed in 559 pretreatment tumor samples from
the California Childhood Leukemia Study. Parent and child's
passive tobacco exposure was assessed using interview-assisted
questionnaires as well as DNA methylation in aryl-hydrocarbon
receptor repressor (AHRR), a sentinel epigenetic biomarker of
exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy. Multivariable
Poisson regressions were used to test the association between the
smoking exposures and total number of deletions. Deletion
burden varied by subtype, with a lower frequency in high-hyper-
diploid and higher frequency in ETV6–RUNX1 fusion ALL. The
total number of deletions per case was positively associated with
tobacco smoke exposure, in particular for maternal ever-smoking
(ratio of means, RM, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08–1.59), maternal smoking
during pregnancy (RM, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12–1.94), and during
breastfeeding (RM, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.48–3.02). The magnitude of
association with maternal ever-smoking was stronger in male
children compared with females (Pinteraction ¼ 0.04). The total
number of deletions was also associated with DNA methylation at
the AHRR epigenetic biomarker (RM, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02–1.69).
Our results suggest that prenatal and early-life tobacco smoke
exposure increase the frequency of somatic deletions in children
who develop ALL. Cancer Res; 77(7); 1674–83. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common
cancer in children under 15 years of age (1). A small proportion
of cases can be explained by well-established factors, such as
congenital cancer predisposition syndromes or exposure to ion-
izing radiation. In addition, several environmental exposures
have been associated with increased ALL risk, including tobacco
smoke, pesticides, paint, and air pollution (2, 3). Despite high
cure rates for ALL, survivors face long-term treatment-related
morbidities and mortality (4); therefore, prevention remains an
important goal. Chromosomal abnormalities that initiate ALL,
including high hyperdiploidy and ETV6–RUNX1 fusion, have
been shown to occur prenatally (5, 6), with subsequent mutations
and copy-number alterations (CNA) acquired as "second hits"
that produce overt leukemia (7). Delineating the role of environ-
mental modifiers of these genetic events will be important in ALL
prevention efforts.
Though the mutational landscape of childhood ALL is simpler
than that of most tumor types, deletions of genes involved in cell-
cycle control, B-lymphocyte development, and hematopoiesis are
the most frequent secondary CNAs (8–10). Assessment of large
numbers of B-cell ALL (B-ALL) cases revealed the most commonly
deleted genes in these pathways include CDKN2A (�27%), ETV6
(�22%), PAX5 (�19%), IKZF1 (�13%), BTG1 (�6%), PAR1
region (�5%), RB1 (�5%), and EBF1 (�2%; refs. 11, 12).
Previous studies have also demonstrated that illegitimate recom-
bination-activating gene (RAG)–mediated recombination events

 underlie genomic deletions in both B-ALL (11) and T-ALL (12).
This intrinsic process normally involves recombination of vari-
able (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene regions through
initiation of the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins, in order to generate
the immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors required for a highly
diversified repertoire of antigen-receptors (reviewed in Fugmann
and colleagues, ref. 13). Occasionally, this V(D)J recombination
goes awry, with erroneous repair of DNA double-strand breaks or
off-target recombination leading to chromosomal rearrange-
ments that may result in hematopoietic malignancies (11, 14,
15). In addition to the reported role of early-life infections (16),
there is strong evidence that tobacco smoke exposure during fetal
development can lead to an increased frequency of off-target V(D)
J recombination-induced deletions (17). Therefore, we explored
the hypothesis that tobacco smoke exposure during gestation and
early life may be associated with an increased frequency of
childhood ALL-associated deletions, and hence may have an
etiologic role in leukemogenesis.
Case–control studies of self-reported tobacco smoking have
revealed inconsistent associations with ALL risk, with most studies
reporting no association with maternal smoking but some report-
ing association with paternal smoking (3, 18–21). However, such
analyses may be confounded by recall bias and often have not
considered germline or somatic genetics. In the current study, we
carried out a case-only analysis of the effects of tobacco smoke
exposure on the frequency of somatic deletions in childhood ALL
cases from the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS).
Approximately half of our cases were of Latino (i.e., Hispanic)
ethnicity, thus providing an opportunity to carry out the first
comparison of the frequency of common childhood ALL gene
deletions in this group compared with non-Latino cases.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved and reviewed by the Institutional
Review Boards at the University of California, Berkeley, the
California Department of Public Health (CDPH), and all partic-
ipating hospitals. Informed consent was obtained from all study
participants.
Study population
The CCLS is a case–control study conducted from 1995 to 2015
and designed to identify risk factors for childhood leukemia.
Incident cases of childhood leukemia under 15 years of age were
identified and rapidly ascertained from pediatric hospitals across
California, generally within 72 hours of diagnosis. Hospitals
collected pretreatment bone marrow and peripheral blood sam-
ples according to study protocols. The study population is
described in further detail elsewhere (3). Control subjects
recruited by CCLS were not used for this current analysis because
this is a case-only study. Eligibility criteria for CCLS included
child's age at diagnosis less than 15 years, no prior cancer diag-
nosis, residence in the study area at the time of diagnosis, and
at least one biological parent available to speak English or
Spanish. Additional eligibility for inclusion in this analysis was
completed interviews and availability of diagnostic bone marrow
samples for analysis of deletions. There were 559 ALL cases with
available covariate information and diagnostic bone marrow (i.e.,
tumor) samples for multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampli-
fication (MLPA) assays (see details below), including 500 B-ALL
and 46 T-ALL cases (immunophenotype was unknown for
13cases). Demographicattributes (e.g.,child's sex,age at diagnosis,
race/ethnicity, and household income) and cytogenetic subtypes
were representative of the overall set of ALL cases in the CCLS
(frequencies within 7% of larger case series; ref. 3). Ofthe 559cases,
52.8% were Latino, 29.4% were non-Latino white, and 17.8% were
of other non-Latino races/ethnicities (including African-American,
Native American, Asian, and mixed/other groups).
Determination of immunophenotype and cytogenetic profiles
Flow cytometry profiles were used to determine immunophe-
notype for ALL cases. Those expressing CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5,
CD7, or CD8 (�20%) were classified as T-lineage and those
positive for CD10 or CD19 (�20%) were classified as B-lineage,
as described previously (22). High hyperdiploidy (HD) was
determined using FISH or G-banding, and ETV6-RUNX1 translo-
cations were identified by FISH probes for chromosome 12p13
(ETV6) and 21q22 (RUNX1) loci (3).
MLPA
Somatic copy number of genes commonly deleted in ALL—
CDKN2A, ETV6, IKZF1, PAX5, BTG1, EBF1, RB1, and genes within
the pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) of the sex chromosomes
(CRLF2, CSF2RA, IL3RA)—was assessed by MLPA using the
SALSA MLPA probemix P335-B1 ALL-IKZF1 (MRC Holland).
MLPA was performed as previously described for 559 ALL samples
with covariate data and sufficient bone marrow DNA available
(23). Analysis of MLPA data was carried out using the Coffalyser.
NET fragment analysis software (MRC Holland) and is further
described in the Supplementary Material.
Self-reported tobacco smoke exposure assessment
Tobacco smoke exposure data were obtained via in-home visits
and computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) from 1995 to
2015, as previously described (3). We categorized tobacco smoke
exposures during particular times of the parent's life, in relation to
the child who developed leukemia: maternal ever-smoking, dur-
ing preconception, during pregnancy, and during breastfeeding;
paternal ever-smoking and during preconception; and finally
child's passive smoke exposure. Parental "ever-smoking" was
defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes, pipes, or cigars
before the child's diagnosis. Additional smoking-related variables
refer only to whether the mother/father ever smoked during the
time period described, irrespective of quantity. Preconception
smoking was defined as smoking during the three months prior
to the child's conception. Child's postnatal passive smoke expo-
sure was defined as presence of a regular smoker (e.g., the mother,
father, or other individual) in the household up to the child's third
birthday or ALL diagnosis (whichever came first). Tobacco smoke
exposure was also assessed as a continuous variable, with esti-
mates reported for each 5-unit increase in number of cigarettes
per day.
Tobacco smoke epigenetic biomarker analysis
Neonatal genome-wide DNA methylation data were available
for a subset of B-ALL cases (n ¼ 198). Germline (i.e., nontumor)
DNA was extracted from neonatal dried bloodspots and bisulfite-
treated, before being assayed using Illumina HumanMethyla-
tion450 Beadchip arrays (450K arrays), with data normalized to
remove batch and plate-position effect as previously described
(24). Genotype data were also available at SNP rs148405299, a

 recently identified methyl-quantitative trait locus (methyl-QTL)
for methylation at the AHRR CpG cg05575921 (24). Decreased
methylation at cg05575921 is strongly associated with in utero
exposure to maternal smoking (24, 25), and not paternal or
maternal preconception smoking or mother's exposure to sec-
ondhand smoke (26).
Statistical analysis
The number of ALL-associated deletions was not normally
distributed, thus nonparametric tests were used to examine
bivariate associations between the number of deletions and
demographic characteristics and cytogenetic subtypes. Pearson
c2 tests were used to assess frequency of specific gene deletions
(CDKN2A, ETV6, etc.) across ALL immunophenotypes and
cytogenetic subtypes, and across the different ethnicities. Mutu-
al exclusivity analysis was carried out for each possible gene
pair (n ¼ 28) using Gitools software, as described in the
Supplementary Material.
To analyze the relationship between self-reported tobacco
smoke exposures and the number of deletions in the tumor, we
carried out multivariable Poisson regression analyses with the
number of deletions as the outcome, using the ratio of means
(RM) as the measure of association. Covariates included in the
final model were age at diagnosis (continuous), sex, household
education (highest education among mother and father), and
paternal age (continuous) based on a P value cutoff of 0.20 from
bivariate tests of each covariate with the number of deletions
(Table 1). Race/ethnicity, maternal age, and income were con-
sidered but not included in the final model as the P values in
bivariate tests exceeded the cutoff. Education and income were
highly correlated, but education was used as it was more signif-
icantly associated with number of deletions. Correlation between
the tobacco exposure variables was tested using Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient.
Independence of maternal and paternal associations with
number of deletions was tested using multivariable Poisson
regression for maternal ever-smoking and paternal ever-smok-
ing adjusted for each other; paternal preconception smoking
adjusted for maternal "prenatal" (preconception and/or preg-
nancy) smoking; and for maternal smoking during preconcep-
tion, pregnancy, and breastfeeding all adjusted for paternal
preconception smoking.
We also explored the effects of cumulative tobacco exposures.
The total number of exposures was calculated using the four
bivariate exposures: paternal and maternal smoking during pre-
conception, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and child's
postnatal passive smoking (which includes maternal breastfeed-
ing smoking). Multivariable Poisson regression was used to test
the association between number of deletions and number of
tobacco exposures as both continuous and categorical variables.
The joint effects of paternal preconception plus maternal "pre-
natal" smoking, maternal "prenatal" smoking plus child's post-
natal passive smoking, and paternal preconception plus child's
postnatal passive smoking were also tested using multivariable
Poisson regression.
Additional analyses were restricted to B-ALL and stratified by
the two main cytogenetic subtypes of ALL, i.e., HD and ETV6–
RUNX1 fusion. Multiplicative interactions were also tested
between each tobacco smoke exposure and age at diagnosis, sex,
and Latino ethnicity (compared with non-Latino whites). The
likelihood ratio test was carried out comparing each model with
and without the interaction terms and using 0.05 as the P value
threshold for statistical significance. To further assess the impact
of maternal smoking during breastfeeding, we restricted analysis
to mothers who breastfed and evaluated a potential trend by
duration of breastfeeding. Interactions between maternal smok-
ing during breastfeeding and duration of breastfeeding were
tested using duration of breastfeeding as binary (<6 months vs.
�6 months) and continuous (in weeks) variables.
Logistic regression analysis was carried out to test the associ-
ation between self-reported maternal smoking during pregnancy
(yes/no) and DNA methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 in a
subset of cases (n ¼ 198). This model was adjusted for gestational
age, sex, race/ethnicity, estimated cell-mixture, methylation
array batch number, and genotype at the methyl-QTL SNP
rs148405299, as previously described (24). Multivariable Poisson
regression analysis was carried out to test the association between
DNA methylation at cg05575921 (in beta-values) and total
number of deletions in each case (as the outcome), adjusted for
the same variables listed above. In a previous study of maternal
smoking during pregnancy and neonatal methylation levels,
neonates of mothers with undetectable cotinine levels had a
median AHRR cg05575921 beta-value of 0.88 compared with a
median of 0.78 for neonates of mothers with high cotinine levels
(27). Therefore, estimates in our regression analysis were calcu-
lated for a 0.1 beta-value decrease at cg05575921, to reflect a
biologically relevant difference. This analysis was also carried out
separately in males (n ¼ 107) and females (n ¼ 91). All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS software or the R statistical
environment.
Results
Demographic and subtype-specific characteristics of deletions
in childhood ALL
In 559 ALL cases, we identified 206 (36.9%) with zero deletions
and 353 (63.1%) with at least 1 deletion across the 8 genes tested.
The mean number of deletions across cases was 1.0 [standard
deviation (SD), 1.1], with a maximum of 5 genes deleted in only
5 (0.9%) cases (Supplementary Table S1). Demographic charac-
teristics of the cases are presented in Table 1. The mean age at
diagnosis was 5.6 years (range, 0.3–14.9), and a highly significant
positive association was seen between age at diagnosis and
number of deletions in the child's leukemia in the bivariate tests
(P < 0.0001; Table 1). This association was also observed in all
multivariable analyses with tobacco smoke exposures (P value
range, 0.0002–0.003). The total number of deletions was similar
between Latinos and non-Latinos (Supplementary Figs. S1–S3),
and there was no association with sex or parental age at child's
birth (Table 1). There was a significant inverse association
between number of deletions and household education (P ¼
0.003) in the bivariate tests, though there was no association with
parental income (P ¼ 0.39). The association between household
education and deletion frequency remained significant or mar-
ginally significant in the multivariable analyses (P value range,
0.01–0.06).
There was no significant difference in deletion burden between
B-ALL and T-ALL, but there was a significant difference between
the two main B-ALL cytogenetic subtypes (HD and ETV6-RUNX1
fusion; Fig. 1; Table 1). HD-ALL cases had a significantly lower
number of deletions compared with non–HD-ALL cases (P <
0.0001), whereas ETV6–RUNX1 fusion cases had a significantly

 higher number of deletions compared with non–ETV6–RUNX1
cases (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1; Table 1). After excluding ETV6, the
number of deletions in ETV6–RUNX1 fusion cases was no longer
significantly higher (P ¼ 0.35); thus, this difference was driven by
deletion of the nontranslocated copy of ETV6.
The most frequently deleted genes were CDKN2A (28.8%),
ETV6 (21.3%), PAX5 (17.7%), and IKZF1 (14.8%; Fig. 2). There
was variation in particular gene frequencies when stratifying by
immunophenotype and by cytogenetic subtype (Fig. 2). Loss of
ETV6 (P ¼ 4.5 � 10�30) and BTG1 (P ¼ 3.6 � 10�8) was more
frequent in ETV6–RUNX1 fusion cases and loss of IKZF1 (P ¼ 7.1
� 10�18) and PAR1 region (P ¼ 3.4 � 10�6) was more frequent in
the non-HD, non–ETV6–RUNX1 B-ALL group (Fig. 2). In T-ALL,
loss of CDKN2A (69.6%) was significantly more frequent than in
B-ALL (25.2%; P ¼ 2.2 � 10�10). Gene deletion frequencies were
similar in Latinos compared with non-Latinos (Supplementary
Table S2; Supplementary Figs. S4–S6).
Loss of CDKN2A was consistently mutually exclusive of loss of
ETV6, with P ¼ 2.9 � 10�11 in B-ALL and P ¼ 2.1 � 10�6 in T-ALL.
In B-ALL, loss of IKZF1 was mutually exclusive of both CDKN2A
(P ¼ 6.3 � 10�5) and ETV6 deletions (P ¼ 1.2 � 10�7). Significant
exclusivity was also found between CDKN2A deletions and loss of
RB1 (P ¼ 0.01) and PAR1 (P ¼ 0.03), between ETV6 deletions and
loss of PAX5 (P ¼ 0.003) and PAR1 (P ¼ 4.2 � 10�4), and between
PAX5 deletions and loss of BTG1 (P ¼ 0.03), PAR1 (P ¼ 0.003),
and EBF1 (P ¼ 0.03).In non-HD,non–ETV6–RUNX1B-ALL, there
was significant codeletion of PAX5 with CDKN2A (P ¼ 0.005),
IKZF1 with BTG1 (P ¼ 0.04), and BTG1 with EBF1 (P ¼ 0.003).
Self-reported tobacco smoke exposure and deletion burden
Tobacco smoke exposure as a categorical variable was consis-
tently associated with a higher number of ALL-associated dele-
tions in multivariable models, including significant associations
for maternal ever-smoking (RM, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08–1.59) and for
paternal smoking during preconception (RM, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05–
1.53; Table 2). A greater effect size was seen for maternal smoking
during pregnancy (RM, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12–1.94) and during
breastfeeding (RM, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.48–3.02). Breastfeeding itself
was not associated with number of deletions and, among mothers
who did breastfeed, the duration of the breastfeeding period did

 not affect the association between maternal smoking and number
of deletions (data not shown). Similar associations were observed
when treating smoke exposure as a continuous variable (Table 2)
and when analyses were restricted to B-ALL only (Supplementary
Table S3). Stratifying by cytogenetic subtype, significant associa-
tions were seen for the ETV6–RUNX1 fusion but not for HD-ALL
cases (Supplementary Table S3). A proportion of cases with zero
deletions was positive for each of the binary smoking variables,
although frequencies were consistently lower than for cases with
multiple deletions (Supplementary Table S4).
All tobacco smoking exposures were significantly correlated,
with strongest correlations between maternal variables (correla-
tion coefficient rho range ¼ 0.32–0.99). Child's postnatal passive
smoking was moderately correlated with maternal smoking vari-
ables (rho range ¼ 0.34–0.63) and paternal smoking variables
(rho range ¼ 0.36–0.50). Correlation between maternal and
paternal smoking variables was relatively low (rho range ¼
0.12–0.37; Supplementary Table S5).
In the multivariable Poisson regressions adjusting paternal

 maternal prenatal smoking (RM, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.16–2.07), and
child's postnatal passive smoking with both paternal preconcep-
tion smoking (RM, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.16–1.88) and maternal
prenatal smoking (RM, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.18–1.92), whereas these
exposures alone were not significantly associated with number of
deletions (Supplementary Table S7).
We also tested for multiplicative interactions between the effect
of the binary smoking exposures and child's age at diagnosis, sex,
and race/ethnicity on the number of deletions detected. No
significant interactions were found between any of the smoking
variables and race/ethnicity. Paternal preconception smoking
displayed a statistical interaction with age at diagnosis (as a
continuous variable; Pinteraction ¼ 0.03), with a stronger effect on
the number of deletions in younger children, with a decrease in
the estimate by, on average, 5.2% (95% CI, 0.3–9.8%, P ¼ 0.04)
for every one year increase in age at diagnosis. The impact of
paternal smoking during preconception leveled after age 6
(Supplementary Fig. S7); therefore, we also modeled the inter-
action with child's age as a binary variable to summarize the
risk estimate for children �6 years of age. The RM for paternal
smoking during preconception was 1.48 (95% CI, 1.17–1.87)
in children age �6 years and 1.02 (0.74–1.40) for children �7
years of age (Pinteraction ¼ 0.057).
The effect of parental smoking on deletions differed by child's
sex. For maternal ever-smoking, the RM and 95% CI in females
was 1.01 (0.73–1.39) and in males it was 1.54 (1.21–1.96;
Pinteraction ¼ 0.04), with a trend in the same direction seen for
paternal ever-smoking (Pinteraction ¼ 0.16) (Supplementary
Table S8). The association of maternal smoking during pre-
conception also differed between females (RM, 0.96; 95% CI,

(Pinteraction ¼ 0.24), though these did not reach significance
(Supplementary Table S8).
Methylation at AHRR CpG cg05575921 and deletion burden
To assess validity of the self-reported data on maternal smoking
during pregnancy, we examined the relationship with DNA meth-
ylation at cg05575921 in a subset of B-ALL cases with available
neonatal methylation data (n ¼ 198). We found a highly signif-
icant association between decreased methylation at cg05575921
and maternal smoking during pregnancy (P ¼ 5.0 � 10�4), with a
0.1 decrease in beta-value associated with a 6.3-fold increased
odds of exposure (95% CI, 2.34–19.23). This was in the expected
direction, as reduced methylation at cg05575921 is associated
with increased tobacco smoke exposure. Reduced methylation at
AHRR CpG cg05575921 was also associated with an increased
total number of deletions in the 198 B-ALL cases, with RM ¼ 1.32
(95% CI, 1.02–1.69; Table 4), thus validating the association first
identified using self-reported smoking exposure data with an
orthogonal epigenetic biomarker. When stratified by sex, this
association became stronger in males (RM, 1.45; 95% CI,
1.05–2.00) but was nonsignificant in females (RM, 1.28; 95%
CI, 0.82–2.00); however, the interaction between sex and number
of deletions was not significant in the multivariable Poisson
regression model (Pinteraction ¼ 0.90).
Discussion
In this study, we carried out copy-number analysis of common
ALL gene deletions in 559 cases from the CCLS and describe the
first comparison of the frequency of these common CNAs in
Latino children with ALL compared with non-Latino children.
Furthermore, this is the first reported association study of an
environmental exposure—tobacco smoke—and frequency of
somatic CNAs in ALL, which was performed using a case-only
comparison with data from parental interviews and from an
unbiased epigenetic biomarker of tobacco smoke exposure.
Using a well-established MLPA assay for assessment of com-
mon childhood ALL gene deletions (9), we found a similar
frequency of deletions and a similar proportion of ALL cases with
at least one deletion as previously reported (9, 28). To investigate
a potential environmental etiology of these deletions, we assessed
self-reported tobacco exposure data and found significant asso-
ciations between maternal smoking ever, during pregnancy, and
during breastfeeding, paternal preconception smoking, and
child's postnatal passive smoking and the total number of dele-
tions per case. We also found evidence of dose–response relation-
ships, with highly significant associations with the continuous
variables "paternal smoking during preconception" and, in par-
ticular, for "maternal smoking during breastfeeding," with a 74%
increase in mean deletion number for every 5 cigarettes smoked
per day during this period. Additional analyses adjusting maternal
smoking variables for paternal smoking, and vice-versa, sup-
ported that these were independent associations. Itwas interesting
to note that both prenatal and postnatal tobacco exposures
showed positive associations with tumor deletions. Indeed, cases
whose mothers smoked during breastfeeding harbored, on aver-
age, over twice as many deletions as cases whose mothers did not
smoke during this period, though the number of exposed cases
was small. Furthermore, the significant cumulative effect of
tobacco exposures on frequency of gene deletions and the joint
effects of maternal and paternal prenatal smoking with child's
postnatal passive smoking support that children heavily exposed
to tobacco over long periods of time are at greatest risk of
developing somatic gene deletions. We also found intriguing
interactions, including between paternal preconception smoking
and child's age-at-diagnosis, with a significant effect on deletion
number seen only in cases 6 years of age or younger, which
includes the peak age of incidence of ALL. This interaction was
not observed for maternal smoking. Our results suggest that
paternal preconception smoking, which is known to cause oxi-
dative damage to sperm DNA (29), may lead to a higher propen-
sity of leukemia gene deletions in children with earlier-onset
leukemias. However, this finding will need confirmation in other
studies before this scenario is established.
There was also a significant interaction between child's sex and
both maternal ever-smoking and maternal smoking during pre-
conception, with an association with increased number of dele-
tions in male cases only. Males also showed a trend toward higher
mean number of deletions than females (Table 1), though this
was not significant. Male fetuses grow more rapidly than females
(30), which may lead to increased vulnerability of developing
lymphocytes to clastogenic toxins. Studies have also shown sexual
dimorphism in inflammatory responses to infection, with greater
inflammation seen in males compared with females (31). Fur-
thermore, mothers carrying male fetuses produce more proin-
flammatory cytokines than mothers carrying females (32). It is
possible, therefore, that sex-specific immune responses to tobacco
smoke, such as the propagation of preleukemic clones with
subsequent generation of "second-hit" deletions, may contribute
to the increased incidence of ALL seen in males compared with
females (33, 34).
Case–control studies of self-reported tobacco smoke exposures
have reported significant association between paternal precon-
ception smoking and childhood ALL risk (19, 35). Indeed, a case–
control study of CCLS participants found that the joint effect of
paternal prenatal smoking combined with child's postnatal pas-
sive smoking was associated with childhood ALL risk (3). This
association was stronger in ETV6–RUNX1 fusion ALL but was not
significant in HD-ALL. We also found our tobacco exposure results
were no longer significant when restricted to HD-ALL, perhaps

 due to the lower frequency of deletions in this subtype, though
numbers of cases in these stratified analyses were small. In
addition to the possible mutagenic effects of paternal preconcep-
tion smoking, children may be exposed to third-hand smoke due
to residues that persist in the home (3). Further, it has been shown
that the effects of paternal preconception smoking on childhood
ALL risk are similar to the effects of paternal smoking during
pregnancy (20). Therefore, children whose fathers smoked in
preconception may also have been exposed to paternal smoking
during pregnancy and postnatally, which are likely the more
critical time windows given the timing of deletions in ALL devel-
opment (9).
In contrast to paternal smoking, case–control studies have
revealed little evidence of a role for maternal smoking during
pregnancy (3, 20, 21) or during breastfeeding (36) in ALL etiol-
ogy. One of the main weaknesses in case–control studies using
interview data is the potential for parental recall and response
bias, and this may vary for reports of maternal versus paternal
smoking behaviors. Given the case-only design of this study,
differential recall bias (between exposed and unexposed) was
unlikely to affect results. Moreover, in a subset of cases with
available neonatal methylation data, we found that self-reported
maternal smoking during pregnancy was highly significantly
associated with neonatal methylation levels at the AHRR CpG
cg05575921, which previously has been strongly associated with
sustained maternal smoking during pregnancy (24–26). We used
this epigenetic biomarker to biologically validate the association
between prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and increased number
of deletions in the leukemia. The association between AHRR
methylation and number of deletions became more significant
when stratified by sex, with a significant effect seen in males but
not females, further supporting the male-specific association seen
in our analyses of parentally reported smoking data. This inter-
action did not reach significance, perhaps due to small sample
size, thus further work is required to elucidate the potential sex-
specific effects of tobacco exposure. Furthermore, the association
between AHRR methylation and deletion number may underes-
timate the true effect, given that neonatally assessed DNA meth-
ylation at cg05575921 does not capture postnatal tobacco expo-
sure. Only a small proportion of variation in cg05575921 meth-
ylation is explained by prenatal smoking exposure (24), and
neonatal methylation at AHRR has been associated with maternal
BMI, birth weight, and gestational age (although cg05575921 was
not specifically examined; ref. 37). It is possible, therefore, that
there may be additional untested environmental exposures that
confound the association between cg05575921 methylation and
number of deletions in our ALL cases.
The clastogenic effects of tobacco smoke exposure are well
established (38–41). As deletion breakpoint locations were
not provided by MLPA, we could not explore the molecular
mechanisms underlying the formation of deletions in our ALL
cases. However, sequencing analyses have demonstrated that
erroneous V(D)J recombination appears to underlie the majority
of deletions in ALL (11, 12). In support of our findings, an
increased frequency of off-target V(D)J recombination-mediated
genomic deletions was found in cord blood T lymphocytes from
children of mothers exposed to active or passive tobacco smoke
during pregnancy compared with children of unexposed mothers
(17, 42). Such deletions may arise via increased inflammation and
leukocytosis
caused
by
chemicals
within
tobacco
smoke
(reviewed in ref. 43). Alternatively, it has been proposed that
tobacco-induced hypomethylation may lead to an increase in off-
target V(D)J recombination-mediated deletions (17, 44).
Our study comprises the largest assessment of somatic CNAs in
ALL in Latino children. Frequency of deletions was similar in
Latino ALL cases compared with non-Latino white cases. Given
that the number of non-Latino children included in this study was
relatively small, we also compared frequency of gene deletions in
our Latino cases with previously published data from 1427 non-
Latino white cases from the UK (9), and again found no significant
differences (data not shown). Variation in gene deletion frequen-
cy is, thus, unlikely to contribute to the increased risk of ALL in
Latino children (33, 45),nor in the poorer survival associated with
this group (34, 46).
Though we found no association with ethnicity, we did confirm
the positive association between number of deletions and age at
diagnosis (9, 23), and also confirmed the low frequency of
deletions in HD-ALL and the high frequency, particularly of ETV6
and BTG1, in ETV6–RUNX1 fusion ALL (9, 11). Furthermore, we
found a much higher prevalence of CDKN2A deletions in T-ALL
cases relative to B-ALL cases, with a frequency similar to that
reported by Mullighan and colleagues (8) and somewhat higher
than the �50% detected by Sulong and colleagues (47), though
the larger sample size in the latter study (n ¼ 266) may reflect a
more accurate proportion. Deletions of genes involved in the
same leukemogenic pathways were mutually exclusive, for exam-
ple the two tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and RB1, and with
genes involved in hematopoiesis and B-cell development, includ-
ing ETV6, PAX5, IKZF1, and the PAR1 region (corresponding with
CRLF2 rearrangement). However, deletions of genes with differ-
ent functions were also significantly mutually exclusive, particu-
larly loss of CDKN2A with both ETV6 and IKZF1, supporting that
disruption of different pathways can lead to ALL. Though we did
not have cytogenetic data pertaining to the BCR–ABL1 fusion,
BCR–ABL1-like, or intrachromosomal amplification of chromo-
some 21 (iAMP21) subtypes of B-ALL, the significantly higher
frequency of loss of IKZF1 and PAR1, and codeletion of CDKN2A
with PAX5 in the "non-HD, non–ETV6–RUNX1" cases aligns with
previous observations of genomic alterations in these high-risk
ALL subgroups (28, 48–50).
It is important to note that the MLPA assay used in this study
does not provide genome-wide copy-number information, albeit
the 8 genes included are those most frequently lost in ALL (9, 10).
Some cases may, therefore, harbor additional deletions in genes
thatwerenot investigated, thoughtherelativeinfrequency ofthese
deletions makes them unlikely to affect our results. MLPA may not
detect deletions restricted to minor subclones, although these are
more likely to arise later during tumor evolution and may have a
different etiology than earlier deletions. We also do not know the
timing of deletion events relative to the onset of overt leukemia,
and hence the relationship of this timing to the tobacco exposure.
An additional caveat is that there may be unmeasured environ-
mental exposures that could confound our results, for example
unmeasured factors associated with socioeconomic status not
captured in our models by household education.
In summary, we provide evidence that increased tobacco smoke
exposure increases the generation of somatic ALL-associated
driver deletions in children. To our knowledge, this is also the
first reported application of an epigenetic biomarker to assess
the effects of an environmental exposure on leukemogenic altera-
tions. Outcome data were not available; thus, future studies
should explore whether tobacco exposure may be associated with

 higher-risk ALL, given that these tend to harbor a higher frequency
of deletions than standard risk ALL (9, 28). In addition, sequenc-
ing analysis of ALL deletion breakpoints will be required to
determine whether tobacco smoke exposure is associated specif-
ically with RAG recombination-mediated deletions. Our findings
should be added to an already compelling list of reasons for
minimizing the prenatal and early-life tobacco smoke exposure of
children.
