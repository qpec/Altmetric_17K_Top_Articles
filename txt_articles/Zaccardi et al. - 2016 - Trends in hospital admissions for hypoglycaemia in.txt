ABSTRACT 
 
Background 
Previous studies in the US and Canada have reported increasing or stable trends of hospital admissions for 
hypoglycaemia. As few data from small studies are available for other countries, information on long–term 
trends of hospital admission for hypoglycaemia and subsequent outcomes in England is an important input 
to understand the global burden of hospitalisation for hypoglycaemia.  
 
Methods  
We collected data on all hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia between January 2005 and December 2014 
using the Hospital Episode Statistics database to assess: trends of crude and adjusted (age, sex, ethnicity, 
social deprivation, and Charlson comorbidity score) admissions for hypoglycaemia; trends of hypoglycaemia 
admissions using total hospital admissions and diabetes prevalence as denominators; and trends of length 
of stay, in–hospital mortality, and one–month readmissions for hypoglycaemia  
  
Findings  
Between 2005 and 2014, 79,172 patients experienced 101,475 admissions for hypoglycaemia, of which 72% 
occurred in people aged ≥60 years old and 18% in people with a previous admission. The number of 
admissions increased steadily from 2005 until 2010, and stabilised after 2010 (39% overall increase, range 
11% to 89% across England regions); the trend was similar when adjusted for risk factors, with a rate ratio 
of 1·53 (95% confidence interval: 1·29 to 1·81) comparing 2014 to 2005. Admissions for hypoglycaemia 
increased from 63 to 79 per 100,000 total hospital admissions between 2005/6 and 2010/11 and then 
declined to 72 per 100,000 in 2013/14 (14% overall increase). Accounting for diabetes prevalence, rates 
declined from 4·64 to 3·86 admissions/1000 person-years between 2010/11 and 2013/14. With some 
differences across regions, from 2005 to 2014 the adjusted proportion of same day discharge increased by 
43·8% (18·9 to 27·1 per 100 admissions); in–hospital mortality decreased by 46·3% (4·2 to 2·3 per 100 
admissions); and one-month readmissions decreased by 63·0% (48·1 to 17·8 per 100 readmissions) 
 
Interpretation  
Over 10 years, hospital admissions in England for hypoglycaemia increased by 39% in absolute terms and 
by 14% considering the general increase in hospitalisation; accounting for diabetes prevalence, however, 
there was a reduction of admission rates. Hospital length of stay, mortality, and one–month readmissions 
decreased progressively and consistently during the last 10 years. Given the continuous rise of diabetes 
prevalence, ageing population, and costs associated with hypoglycaemia, individual and national initiatives 
should be implemented to reduce the burden of hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia

INTRODUCTION 
 
In randomised control trials, intensive glucose control reduces long–term risk of microvascular and, to some 
extent, macrovascular diabetes complications.1 Striving for intensive control may result in higher rates of 
hypoglycaemia.2 As hypoglycaemia is associated with a deterioration in quality of life and possibly a higher 
risk of vascular events and mortality,3-9 clinicians often face a trade–off between the benefits of intensive 
glucose lowering and the drawbacks of hypoglycaemia.  
Most hypoglycaemic episodes are generally of mild severity and self–treated by patients. Severe episodes, 
which require third party assistance, are less common (1–2 episodes per year in insulin–treated patients) 
but represent a greater economic burden on healthcare systems.10,11 Some of these episodes require 
paramedic support, attendance at accident and emergency departments, or hospital admission. Precise 
estimates of the proportion of patients requiring these different services are not available in England, mainly 
because of a lack of nationally integrated electronic health record systems. Nevertheless, although hospital 
admissions for hypoglycaemia represent a small proportion of emergency department visits, they have 
significant resource implications.11 The mean cost per admission for hypoglycaemia in England has been 
estimated to be slightly in excess of £1,000 (~1,300€), with a total annual direct cost of severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes around £13 million in the UK.12,13 
Older age, multimorbidity, and insulin therapy are well–recognised and interrelated risk factors for 
hypoglycaemia.14 Given the rise in diabetes prevalence and an ageing population,15,16 the number of 
admissions to hospital due to hypoglycaemia has possibly increased in recent years. This has recently been 
confirmed in a nationally representative sample of North Americans,17 while very few data are available for 
other countries and little is known on a global scale. Detailed analysis of contemporary trends for England 
can therefore contribute to understand the global burden of hospitalisation for hypoglycaemia.   
The aim of this study was to characterise 10-year trend, from 2005 to 2014, of hospital admissions for 
hypoglycaemia and associated length of hospital stay, mortality, and readmissions using the Hospital Episode 
Statistics (HES) database, which includes data of hospital admissions for the entire population of England.

METHODS 
Study design, setting, and source data  
In this nationwide, retrospective observational study, we extracted data on people admitted to hospitals for 
hypoglycaemia from the HES database,18 which contains details of all admissions to English National Health 
Service  hospital trusts. All hospital admissions due to hypoglycaemic episodes (unit of the study) were 
sought from 1/1/2005 to 31/12/2014. Criteria for data extraction are reported in detail in the appendix Table 
A1. We included all anonymised admission episodes reporting hypoglycaemia as primary reason of 
admission, i.e. the first ICD–10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision) diagnosis field E160 
(drug–induced hypoglycaemia without coma), E161 (other hypoglycaemia), or E162 (hypoglycaemia, 
unspecified) and E10+ (diabetes type 1) or E11+ (diabetes type 2) in any of the remaining ICD–10 fields 
(from 2nd to 20th). For all episodes, we collected data on age, sex, self-reported ethnicity, region of usual 
residence, start and end date of the episode, admission and discharge method, Index of Multiple Deprivation 
(IMD, an overall measure which combines information from several indicators and indicates deprivation 
experienced by people living in an area), and used ICD–10 fields to calculate the Charlson comorbidity score, 
an index measuring the effect of simultaneous conditions on mortality (Table A1–A3).19 Data on total hospital 
admissions and prevalence of diabetes were obtained from the publicly available reports of HES and Quality 
and Outcomes Framework (which contains data collected on a voluntary process for all surgeries in England), 
respectively.18,20 
 
Data analysis 
Stata, version 14.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas), was used for all analyses, and results are reported 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To assess trends, for all analyses we used calendar time as a factor 
variable and considered the first calendar year as baseline. 
We first reported region (East, East Midlands, London, North East, North West, South East, South West, 
West Midlands, and Yorkshire–Humber) and age–specific (<20 years old; 20–29; 30–39; 40–49; 50–59; 
60–69; 70–79; ≥80) crude trends. Secondly, for each age–group, sex, and ethnicity (White, Caribbean, 
Indian, Pakistani, other, not available), we calculated the mean IMD–10 (deciles of IMD) and Charlson 
comorbidity score and the total number of admissions to estimate the trend of admissions adjusted for these 
risk factors with Poisson regression. Thirdly, we estimated trend of admissions for hypoglycaemia out of total 
hospital admissions with logistic regression; as total admissions were available from April 1 to March 31 
(financial year), admissions for hypoglycaemia were estimated during the same interval. Lastly, we fit 
Poisson regressions to calculate trends in admission rates using the number of admissions for hypoglycaemia 
 6 
 
(numerator) and the mid-point prevalence of diabetes (denominator/exposure) between two consecutive 
estimates (March 31). From 2010 onwards, data on diabetes prevalence were available only for subjects 
aged 17 or older. We therefore reported rates from 2010 to 2014 of subjects aged 17 or older to be consistent 
with prevalence data.  
We also calculated the length of hospital stay, assessed whether the admission resulted in hospital death 
(all-cause mortality), and estimated time intervals between consecutive admissions occurring in the same 
year to calculate the proportion of one–month readmissions for hypoglycaemia out of total readmissions. 
We categorised the length of hospital stay in five ordered groups of similar size (same day discharge; day 
after discharge; two to three days; four to eight days; nine or more days) and performed an ordered logistic 
regression, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, IMD–10, and Charlson comorbidity score, to assess trend over 
time of hospital length of stay. Likewise, we fit logistic regressions with the same covariates to characterise 
trends for hospital mortality and one–month readmissions. All regressions were complete-case and included 
calendar year as a factor variable: the latter enabled the estimation of adjusted proportions with margin 
command for each region and overall. Odds ratios of risk factors were pooled across regions by random–
effects meta–analyses and heterogeneity in the associations was estimated by the I2 statistic.21

RESULTS 
Characteristics of admissions for hypoglycaemia 
From 1/1/2005 to 31/12/2014, in England there were a total of 101,475 hospital admissions for 
hypoglycaemia in 79,172 people; 65,248 (82%) had a single episode (Table 1). Admissions occurred in 
males and females equally and the majority of cases were of White European ethnic origin. The median 
Charlson comorbidity score was 1 (Table 2). Admissions were more frequent in older people, with subjects 
aged 60 or older accounting for 72% of total cases (Figure 1). When adjusted for sex, ethnicity, IMD-10, 
and Charlson comorbidity score, age showed a J–shaped relationship with admissions: compared with people 
younger than 20 years old, we found a reduced risk in people between 20 to 49 and an increased risk in 
people aged 50 or older (appendix Figure A1). In 95% of all admissions, people attended “accident and 
emergency services” (87%) or were referred by a general practitioner (8%) (Table A4). Admissions were 
associated with at least three medical conditions in 50% of cases, of which the most common were essential 
hypertension, atrial fibrillation/flutter, urinary tract infection, chronic or acute renal failure, and chronic 
ischaemic heart disease (Figure A2).  
 
Temporal trends 
The overall number of admissions for hypoglycaemia increased progressively over time, from 7868 in 2005 
to 11,756 in 2010 (49% increase), and then remained more stable until 2014 (10,977; 39% increase from 
baseline) (Figure A3 and Table A5). We found a similar overall trend after adjusting for risk factors, with a 
rate ratio of 1·53 (95% CI: 1·29 to 1·81) comparing 2014 to 2005 (Figure 2). Across regions, crude overall 
admissions increased by a minimum of 11% in East Midlands to a maximum of 89% in London (Table A5).  
When admissions for hypoglycaemia were estimated per total hospital admissions, we found an increase 
from 2005 for all the following years, with a peak in 2010/11 and a subsequent decline (Figure A4). Total 
admissions progressively increased from 12·7 million in 2005/6 to 15·5 million in 2013/14 (22% increase) 
while 63 admissions for hypoglycaemia per 100,000 total admissions were recorded in 2005/6, increasing 
to 79 per 100,000 in 2010/11 (24% increase), and then declining to 72 per 100,000 in 2013/14 (14% 
increase from baseline). Similarly, adjusting for diabetes prevalence, we found a decline between 2010/11 
and 2013/14: diabetes prevalence in people aged 17 or older increased from 2·39 million in 2010/11 to 2·75 
million in 2013/14 (16% increase) while admissions decreased from 11,133 to 10,653 (4% decrease), 
resulting in rates declining from 4·64 admissions for hypoglycaemia/1000 person-years with diabetes in 
2010/11 to 3·86 in 2013/14 (rate ratio 2013/14 vs 2010/11: 0·83; 0·81 to 0·85) (Figure A5).   
 
Hospital length of stay and mortality 
 8 
 
Around 24%, 47%, 68%, and 75% of all admissions resulted in a length of hospital stay ≤24 hours, ≤48 
hours, ≤5 days, and ≤7 days, respectively (Figure A6). Female sex, older age, higher Charlson comorbidity 
score, and lower IMD–10 (i.e., more deprived) were significantly associated with a longer length of hospital 
stay, while Indian ethnicity was associated with a shorter stay (Figure A7). Heterogeneity across regions in 
the associations between the risk factors and length of stay was moderate to high (I2 from 30% to 97%) 
(Figure A7 and A8). The crude proportion of same day discharge increased from 21·4% (1685 out of 7486 
admissions) in 2005 to 24·9% (2730 out of 10,974) in 2014. In the analysis adjusted for risk factors, the 
proportion of patients being discharged on the same day of admission increased by 43·8% (95% CI: 33·9 
to 53·6), from 18.9 (16·8 to 20·9) per 100 admissions in 2005 to 27·1 (25·1 to 29·1) in 2014 (Figure 3 and 
A9).  
Three percent of all admissions resulted in hospital death (3109 all-cause deaths in 101,475 admissions; 
Table A4). Age and Charlson comorbidity score were independently associated with higher mortality (Figure 
A7), with moderate–high heterogeneity across regions (I2 from 23% to 90%; Figure A7 and A8). The crude 
inpatient mortality decreased from 3·6% (280 out of 7860 admissions) in 2005 to 2·7% (296 out of 10,976) 
in 2014. Risk factor–adjusted inpatient death declined by 46·3% (95% CI: 40·4 to 52·2), from 4·2 (3·8 to 
4·7) per 100 admissions in 2005 to 2·3 (2·0 to 2·5) in 2014 (Figure 3).  
 
One-month readmission 
During the study period, almost 18% of all admissions for hypoglycaemia occurred in people with a previous 
episode (Table 1); of these readmissions, around 23% occurred within one–month, without a clear difference 
across regions (Figure A10). One–month readmissions, however, decreased significantly over time, 
accounting for 48·1% of total readmission in 2005 and for 17·9% in 2014. Adjusted for risk factors, one–
month readmissions declined by 63·0% (95% CI: 58·6 to 67·4), from 48·1% (43·6 to 52·5) per 100 
readmissions in 2005 to 17·8% (16·5 to 19·1) in 2014 (Figure 3). None of the included risk factors was 
independently associated with one–month readmission (Figure A7 and A8).   
 
Regional differences  
During the study period, improved trends for the three outcomes were to some extent different across 
regions (Figure A11–A13). Comparing 2014 to 2005, we found substantial heterogeneity for same day 
discharge (I2 63%; 95% CI: 24 to 82), with the highest and lowest changes for West and East Midlands, 
respectively (Figure 4). On the other hand, we found lower heterogeneity for both mortality (I2 0%; 0 to 65; 
highest and lowest changes for West Midlands and Yorkshire–Humber, respectively) and one–month 
 9 
 
readmission (I2 36%; 0 to 70; highest and lowest changes for South East and Yorkshire–Humber, 
respectively) (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION 
Using national hospital admissions data for England, we found an increasing trend of admissions for 
hypoglycaemia from 2005 to 2014. In particular, admissions increased steadily during the first five years, 
stabilising from 2010 onwards. We found a similar trend after adjusting for potential risk factors, including 
age, sex, and comorbidities. We evidenced an increase until 2010 followed by subsequent decline accounting 
for changes in total hospitalisation, and a decline in the same period accounting for changes in diabetes 
prevalence. In people admitted for hypoglycaemia, hospital length of stay, in–hospital mortality, and one–
month readmission declined consistently over the 10–year study period, with some differences across 
regions. 
To our knowledge, this is the first report on all hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia in England. We 
reported data across different regions for 10 years and detailed demographical characteristics, associated 
comorbidities, and outcomes in subjects who experienced hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia. HES data 
further enabled us to assess trends over time adjusting for important confounders for admissions, 
particularly age and comorbidity. Moreover, while previous similar research reporting on the burden of 
hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia were performed at regional level or relied on data from representative 
samples to estimate trends at a national level (Table A6), in this study we used all hospital admissions data 
for England. Though not directly comparable, a recent study conducted in England assessed the risk of 
hospitalisation for hypoglycaemia using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (which contains 
primary care records covering approximately 6% of the UK population22) linked to HES (Table A6). Khalid et 
al. estimated rate of hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia as 30 per 10,000 person–years between 2006 
and 2012 in ~100,000 patients with type 2 diabetes.23 This study, however, did not assess trends over time. 
On the other hand, more comparable studies have been performed in the US. Lipska et al.,17 relying upon 
health insurance data to collect information on admissions for hypoglycaemia and national surveys to 
calculate diabetes prevalence, estimated trends of hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia in people aged 65 
years or older at national level. From 1999 to 2011, they reported an absolute increase until 2007 and a 
subsequent decline, with a significant 11% increase of sex–, age–, and ethnicity–adjusted rate comparing 
2011 to 1999. When admissions were adjusted for diabetes prevalence, however, they found a progressive 
decline during the entire study period. Interestingly, both results are in line with our findings, although we 
could estimate the prevalence–adjusted trend only from 2010 and in subjects aged 17 years or older. Further 
to this, they showed a reduction of one–month readmissions for all causes during the study. We limited the 
analysis to all-cause hospital mortality following the episode and readmissions due only to hypoglycaemia 
because our main goal was to assess the burden of hospital admissions rather than estimate how 
hypoglycaemia affects short– and long–term mortality. However, we used national–level data on diabetes 
 11 
 
prevalence and total hospital admissions, reported more detailed information on length of hospital stay (that 
can be used to estimate costs), and extended the analysis to reflect contemporary diabetes management.   
Trends have been reported in three other studies in US and Canada, with slightly differing outcomes. Wang 
et al. showed an absolute and age–adjusted decline of US emergency department visits in adults with 
diabetes between 2006 and 2011,24 while Pathak et al. reported no clinically meaningful age– and sex–
adjusted trend of US emergency department visits or hospitalisation between 2005 and 2011 in people ≥20 
years old.25 Clemens et al.,26 on the other hand, found in people ≥65 years old with diabetes an absolute 
increase in emergency department visits or hospitalisations for hypoglycaemia from 2002 to 2006 and then 
a decline until 2013; a continuous decline was found after accounting for the change in diabetes prevalence.  
A major strength of this research was the availability of all ~100,000 hospital admissions in England over a 
ten year period with information on several potential risk factors and residential location. Therefore, we were 
able to estimate accurately the burden of admissions at national as well as regional level. We found age and 
Charlson comorbidity score to be independently associated with both length of stay and mortality, while 
none of the included risk factors was associated with one–month readmission. We also found significant 
heterogeneity across regions in the impact of risk factors on the three outcomes: heterogeneity was lower 
for sex compared to age, social deprivation, and comorbidities, and was greater for length of stay and one–
month readmissions than for mortality. These divergences, possibly due to a genuine clinical diversity of 
patients (attributable to factors other than those considered in the analysis) or to differences in nonclinical 
causes affecting the three outcomes (such as admission policies), could have influenced trends during the 
study period. Indeed, comparing 2014 to 2005 reductions in inpatient mortality and one–month readmissions 
and increase in same-day discharge were somewhat different across regions.  
Along with strengths, our research had some limitations. First, data on diabetes prevalence were available 
for people aged 17 or older from 2010 and for all people before. Therefore, prevalence data were not 
comparable before and after 2010 and we could not estimate admission rates for the entire period of the 
study in the same population. Moreover, as available diabetes prevalence and total admissions data are not 
stratified by age, we could not detail trends by age groups. Second, we estimated trends for all-cause in–
hospital mortality following the episode and not for short– or long–term mortality after discharge. However, 
previous research in England has already reported on the risk of all–cause and cardiovascular mortality in 
people who experienced episodes of severe hypoglycaemia.8 Third, frequent episodes of severe 
hypoglycaemia affect patient’s functional status, mental performance, and risk of falls, important outcomes 
which could not be assessed here.9 Fourth, the Charlson comorbidity score is extensively used to assess 
comorbidity in epidemiological studies, yet it does not take into account disease severity. Fifth, our analyses 
were limited by the functionality of the health care database available. As HES data are collected for 
 12 
 
administrative rather than research purposes, it is difficult to be absolutely sure of its imputation and coding 
accuracy. Sixth, although we adjusted for several potential confounders, secular trend changes of 
unmeasured factors (such as glucose-lowering therapy) could explain our findings. Lastly, using postcodes 
to identify regions, we assumed that people were admitted to hospitals in regions pertaining to their allotted 
postcode.     
 
Implications for clinicians and policymakers  
There appear to be two common characteristics amongst studies assessing emergency or hospital admissions 
for hypoglycaemia. First, in those investigating temporal trends, absolute admissions reach a peak (2007 in 
US;17 mid–2006 in Canada;26 2010 in our study) and then decline, or decline steadily over time (from 2006 
in US24). Second, older age is a significant risk factor for admissions. Given predicted population ageing, rise 
in diabetes and multimorbidity prevalence,27,28 and risk of potential overtreatment in older people,29 these 
findings indicate that further measures will be required to keep stable or reduce the number of emergency 
department visits and hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia in the future.  
Hypoglycaemia has gathered great attention in recent years, particularly after the publication of randomised 
controlled trials showing a nonsignificant reduction or even an increase in vascular risk in intensively treated 
subjects.30 Glycaemic control targets may therefore have relaxed during the study period at the expense of 
higher rates of hyperglycaemia, as suggested in some but not all previous studies.17,24 This could potentially 
explain the declining trend in hospital admissions and readmissions for hypoglycaemia although we did not 
investigate admission trends for hyperglycaemia. On the other hand, the availability and use of drugs 
associated with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and an improved outpatient care could further explain our 
findings.31,32 A precise estimate of the impact of modifiable risk factors such as glucose control on hospital 
admission rates for hypoglycaemia is difficult. However, an epidemiological analysis of the ACCORD trial 
suggests that the risk of hypoglycaemia resulting in emergency medical care or admission to hospital is 
progressively higher in type 2 diabetes participants with lower baseline HbA1c when comparing intensive vs 
standard glucose-lowering treatments (around 2-times for values ≥8.5%; 3–times for values between 7.5–
8.4%; and 7–times for values <7.5%).33 It is noteworthy that the individualised identification of HbA1c 
targets is just one of a number of approaches to the problem of hypoglycaemia.10 In observational studies, 
structured diabetes education reduce the burden of hypoglycaemia;10 yet, attendance at structured 
education programs remains very low (5.3%) and further effort should be put in place to identify and address 
local barriers.32  
 
 13 
 
The reduction of length of hospital stay and in–hospital mortality following admissions could be attributed to 
tighter glucose control during hospitalisation. Studies published in the last decade have indeed shown better 
hospital outcomes associated with better glucose control.34,35 The results of these studies could likewise have 
influenced glucose management in hospitalised patients, although a general improvement of hospital 
mortality and changes in admission policies may also explain these positive results.36,37 
 
Conclusion  
In England, a rise in overall hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia has been counterbalanced by a decline 
of admissions accounting for the increase of diabetes prevalence, as well as a reduction of length of hospital 
stay, mortality, and readmissions over the 2005–2014 decade. A better picture of hypoglycaemia burden 
would require the availability of data for multiple stages of the admission process, from the episode to the 
hospital admission (i.e., episode–emergency calls–ambulance support–emergency admission–hospital 
admission). This information will clarify the best approach to reduce hospital admissions and identify at what 
stage resources should be allocated.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT 
 
Evidence before this study 
We searched PubMed for manuscripts published in English between Jan 1, 1990, and Jan 20, 2016, using 
the terms “hospital”, “emergency”, and “hypoglyc(a)emia”. No specific inclusion or exclusion criteria were 
applied. Temporal trends of emergency department (ED) visits or hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia 
were reported in three studies published in US and one in Canada. Overall, these studies suggested no 
trends, a peak followed by a decline or a continuous decline over time of ED visits or hospital admissions for 
hypoglycaemia. While some studies have assessed ED visits or admissions for hypoglycaemia at 
regional/local level, no data at national level are to date available. 
 
Added value of this study 
To our knowledge, this is the first report of trends of admissions for hypoglycaemia at a national level. We 
investigated all hospital admissions in England showing a constant increase until 2010 and a stabilisation 
thereafter. Both our findings and previous studies, however, found a decline in admissions when accounting 
for diabetes prevalence and, although differently defined, a reduction of one–month readmissions and 
mortality. Moreover, we also found a steadily reduction over time of length of hospital stay. Taken together, 
the reduced risk of readmission and death and the shorter hospital stay would suggest an improved 
outpatient and inpatient care. Along with North American data, our results can contribute to a better 
understanding of the global burden of hospitalisation for hypoglycaemia.         
 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Given the rise in diabetes prevalence, population age, and the risk of potential overtreatment in older people, 
our findings indicated that further measures will be required to stabilise or reduce ED visits and hospital 
admissions for hypoglycaemia in the next years. More detailed data could inform the best approach to reduce 
hospital admissions and identify where resources should be allocated.

Figure legends 
 
Figure 1: Crude total hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia, England 2005–2014 
Legend: From left to right, columns indicate calendar years 2005 to 2014. Difference indicates change 
2014 versus 2005. Overall, there were 101,475 admissions 
 
Figure 2: Adjusted rate ratios of hospital admissions for hypoglycaemia, England 2005–2014 
Legend: Rate ratios, adjusted for age, sex, index of multiple deprivation, and Charlson comorbidity score, 
are compared to 2005 (reference year, black dotted line) 
 
Figure 3: Trends of length of stay, inpatient mortality, and one–month readmission, England 
2005–2014 
Legend: Estimates adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, IMD–10, and Charlson comorbidity score. Bars indicate 
95%CI 
 
Figure 4: Region-specific same day discharge, inpatient mortality, and one month readmission 
comparing 2014 vs 2005 
Legend: Estimates, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, IMD–10, and Charlson comorbidity score, indicate 
absolute changes per 100 admissions comparing 2014 vs 2005. For example, in Yorkshire-Humber, 9·6 
more admissions out of 100 (i.e., 9·6%) resulted in same day discharge comparing 2014 to 2005. 
Similarly, 1·3 less deaths per 100 admissions and 16·5 less one–month readmissions per 100 readmissions 
occurred in the same period and for the same area. Dotted lines and the 95%CI shadow areas indicate the 
national average for England.
